 in chaatro kaa aarope he ki tees saal puraane is kendriya vishvavidhyalay kii vaais chancelar ne jo apane biodeta main likhaa he wo galat he
 Students have claimed their curriculum vitae under the Right to Information and if they can give so much wrong information about themselves then how can they make moral claim to make the students superior
 is biodeta ko pandicherry unvarsity teachers association kii website puta
 org
 in par bhi daalaa he
 There is also a claim that whatever the Vice Chancellor has stated in his curriculum vitae, if it is accepted as true, then he is nothing compared to the other two candidates
 pandicherry vishvavidhyalay kii vischancelar chandra krishnamurti chauthi baar is pad par hai
 While he did peachad in 2002
 shikshakon or chaatro kaa daawa he ki unhone apane biodeta main teen kitaaben likhane kaa daawa kiya he
 When information was asked from the publishers, it was found that two of his books have never been published
 teesri kitaab jo prakashit hui he usamen paaya gaya ki 98 pratishat jaankaree anya jagah se uthaai gai he
 After 98 percent what is left for original writing
 agar aisa he to kya do din ke bheetar hamaari maanav sansaadhan mantri pataa nahin laga saktin
 Teachers have already done phd on Vice Chancellor's curriculum vitae
 unka daawa he ki chandra krishnamurthi ne 25 paper likhane kaa daawa kiya he
 Some of these have been published by the Council of India and some by the Law University of Bangalore
 aar tii ai se jutai gai jaankaree se pataa chalaa ki aisi jagahon par inkaa koi lekh prakashit nahin hua he
 He even claimed in his curriculum vitae to have secured first place in the first class in the examination of LLB and LLM
 lekin aar tii ai se jo unki sarvice book nikaali gai he, usase pataa chalata he ki ve second class main paas hui hai
 There are many things that must be investigated
 visi kaa bhi paksh saamne aana chahie
 Which is not even in this article
 pandicherry vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro or shikshakon kaa yah bhi daawa he ki vaais chancelar ne niyuktiyon main bhi manamaani kii he
 They all have a long list
 is tarah ke daawey bhi hai ki visi ne apane ghar main shauchalay banane par gyaarah lakh rupee kharch kiye hai
 Two cars have been purchased with government money
 in logon ne raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti ko bhi likhaa he
 If our institutes were run professionally, then all these allegations could be investigated in a month and the students would not have trouble eating sticks
 kulapati bhi apni taraf se bayaan jari kar sakati thim
 Which mountain will break if the Vice Chancellor will give public answer to the students' questions
 phir kis baat ke liye ham 'loktantr loktantr' karte rahete hai
 The comments chaatro kaa daawa he ki pichley ek hafte se andolan chal rahaa he
 VC did not even talk by calling
 ulta police bulavaa kar pitayee karvaa di
 Such news keeps coming from other universities of the country
 aisa nahin hai ki yah sab nai sarkaar ke aane se ho rahaa he
 This has been happening since long time ago
 madhya pradesh or bihar se bhi kulapatiyon ko lekar shikaayatein aa rahi hai
 Movements are going on
 maakhan laal patrakarita vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro ne bhi fasebuk ke inbox main kaaphi kuch likhaa tha ki hamaare yahaan thik nahin chal rahaa he
 But there is no hearing anywhere
 hamaari media main bhi nahin he
 Shows are made for the youth, but there is no place for the questions of the youth
 vishvavidhyalayon se yahi khabar aati rahati he ki itihaas badalane vaala he
 But there was talk of changing the future, why is history changing
 isliye ki raajnneeti na badale
 Therefore, the youth should only cheer Netaji
 acchhee baat ye he ki yuva is khel ko samaj rahe hai
 Universities are demanding quality and professional arrangements
 bhale hi beete pandrah saalon main na kar paayen ho magar kar to rahe hai
 Then when their struggle does not find a place in the media and politics, how can it be claimed that even in the last fifteen years, there were no movements
 sawaal nahin uthe
 Teachers and students claim to have written three books in their curriculum vitae
 prakashkon se jaankaree maangi gai to pataa chalaa ki unki do kitaab kabhi prakashit hi nahin hui he
 In the third book which has been published, it was found that 98 percent information has been picked up from elsewhere
 98 pratishat ke baad moulik lekhan ke liye bachataa hi kya he
 If this is the case, then our HR Minister cannot find out within two days
 shikshakon ne to vaais chancelar ke biodeta par piechdi hi kar daali he
 He claims to have written 25 papers by Chandra Krishnamurthy
 inamen se kuch baar council aaf india ne prakashit kiya he to kuch neshal lau uniwarsity bangaloru ne
 Information gathered from RTI revealed that no such articles have been published in such places
 yahaan tak ki unhone apane biodeta main daawa kiya he ki el el bi or el el em ke imtahaan main pratham shrenee main pratham sthaan hasil kiya he
 But the service book that has been extracted from RTI shows that she has passed in second class
 aisi kai baaten hai jinaki jaanch to honi hi chahie
 The side of the VC should also come to the fore
 jo ki is lekh main bhi nahin he
 Pondicherry University students and teachers also claim that the Vice Chancellor has made arbitrary appointments
 in sabaki ek lambii fehrist di gai he
 There are also claims that the VC has spent eleven lakh rupees to build toilets in his house
 sarkari paise se do do kaaren khridi gayi hai
 These people have also written to the President, Prime Minister and Union Human Resource Minister Smriti
 agar hamaare santhaan peshewar tareeke se chalate to in sab aaropon kii ek maheene main jaanch ho sakati thi or chaatro ko lathi khaane kii naubat nahin aati
 The Vice Chancellor could also issue a statement on his own behalf
 aisa koun sa pahaad tut jayega ki agar kulapati chaatro ke sawaalon kaa saarvajanik jawaab de dengi to
 Then for what we keep doing 'democracy democracy'
 tippaniyan Students claim that the movement has been going on for the past one week
 visi ne bulaakar baat tak nahin kii
 On the contrary, the police were called and beaten
 desh ke anya vishvavidhyalay se bhi aisi khabaren aati rahati hai
 It is not that all this is happening with the new government
 bahut pehle se yah ho rahaa he
 Complaints are being received from the vice-chancellors from Madhya Pradesh and Bihar as well

 Students of Makhan Lal Journalism University also wrote a lot in Facebook inbox that we are not doing well here

 The same news keeps coming from universities that history is about to change
 par badalane kii baat to bhavishya kii ho rahi thi, itihaas kyon badal rahaa he
 Because politics does not change
 isliye yuva sirf netaji ke jayakaare lagaaye
 The good thing is that the youth are understanding this game
 vishvavidhyalayon main gunvattta or peshewar vyavastha kii maang kar rahe hai
 Even if you have not been able to do it in the last fifteen years, but you are doing it

 Since when did we become the Taliban? Is this democracy? azaad hindustan se pehle kashmir ek alag riyasat hua karti thi
 Then Kashmir was ruled by King Hari Singh of Dogra Rajput dynasty
 dogra rajvansh ne us daur main puri riyasat ko ek karne ke liye pehle ladakh ko jeeta tha
 Then in 1840 Kashmir was taken away from the British
 tab 40 lakh kii aabaadi vaali is kashmir riyasat kii sarahadein afghanistan, rus or china se lagati thim
 That is why this state had a special Ahmiyat
 phir san 47 main aazaadee ke baad tab pakistan nayaa-nayaa bana tha
 Now there was Hindustan on one side, Pakistan on the other side and Kashmir, a small piece of land in the middle
 ek aaazaad riyasat
 And this is where our story of Kashmir begins
 70 saal pehle
 There was an attack
 jo khatm hua ek saal do maheene ek haftaa or teen din baad
 Which changed the appearance of heaven
 jisane jananath ko jahannam banane kii buniyaad rakh di
 Who first produced the Mujahideen
 jisane kashmir kii ek nai kahani likh di
 Gulistan, which was watered by Shamsuddin Shah Mir some 700 years ago
 unke baad tamaam nawabon or raajaaon ne jisko sajaayaa-sanvaara tha
 The fragrance of poplar and guldar floated in the assets and fijas
 jise aage chal kar jameen kii jananath kaa khitaab mila
 The same Kashmir
 usee kashmir main aaj se thik 70 saal pehle ek raja kii naadaani or ek hukmran kii manamaani ne phizaon main barood kaa aisa zehar ghola jisaki gandh aaj bhi kashmir main mahasoos kii ja sakati he
 My country
 tera mulk
 My religion tera mazahab
 My land is your land
 mere log tere log
 This non-human stubbornly first broke a laughing nation into two pieces
 lakhon logon ko mazahab ke naam par maar daalaa gaya or phir us jananath ko bhi jahannam bana dayaa gaya
 Whose king requested the British to keep his princely state away from hindu-muslim politics with high hopes
 magar unki riyasat kii sarhadon ke nazadik baithe musalamaanon ke liye pakistan banane vaale kaayade aazam mohammad ali jinna kashmir kii is azaadi ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 Jinnah argued that in view of the number of Hindu people in Junagadh, Gujarat, it was merged with Hindustan, similarly according to the population of Muslims in Kashmir, it is entitled to Pakistan only and only
 apni isi zid ko manwaane ke liye jinna ne kashmir ke maharaja hari singh par dabaav bananaa shuru kar diya
 And stopped the supply of all essential things going to Kashmir
 pakistan kashmir ko apane saath milane ke liye ab takat kaa istemaal karne laga
 But Maharaja Hari Singh still stood by his decision, which he made to the last voice Rai Lord Mountbatten in India
 yani azaad kashmir
 Date - 22 October 1947 Just 9 weeks after independence from the British, at the behest of Jinnah, thousands of tribesmen carried out the incident in Kashmir on behalf of Pakistan
 jisamen hazaron bekasoor kashmiriyon kaa khun baha
 Women were raped and raped
 buudhe bacchon ko bhi nahin bakhsha gaya
 The loot was razed
 makasad tha ki jaise bhi bas kashmir par kabza
 The uniforms of the tribes did not even have an army uniform
 lekin haathon main bandooken, mashin gan or mortar the
 It was clear that Pakistan sent them with complete preparation
 aatankiyon ko josh dilaane ke liye jinna ne unhen mujahidin kaa khitaab diya tha
 In this zeal, the tribes also captured large parts of the city of Muzaffarabad and Dommel
 or wo srinagar ke qareeb uri tak ja pahunche
 Jinnah was attacking Kashmir on one side
 vahiin duusari taraf unke log kashmir kii riyasat main baghawat paidaa karne ke liye muslim sainikon ko bhadakaane lage
 The Muslims of Kashmir who came with those tribesmen are safe
 magar jo khilaaf the unhen aatankiyon ne maut ke ghat utaar diya
 In this battle to change the map of the country, the valley became blood red
 ye tay ho gaya ki kashmir ko bachaana maharaja ke liye naammumkin he
 But in the meantime, the mercenaries sent to Jinnah were plundered
 or wo jinna ke mishan ko chhod lut ke mishan par lag gaye
 There were now only three routes in front of Maharaja Hari Singh
 pehla jo ho rahaa he use hone den or apane haathon se kashmir kii riyasat pakistan ko saunp den
 Second, confront the Pakistani tribes who were involved in the massacre
 
 Although this did not seem possible for him
 or teesraa or aakhri rasta unke saamne ye tha ki wo bharat se madad len or kashmir ko bachaa len
 But the problem with India was that till then Kashmir was not a part of India and in such a situation the Indian government could not take military action

 sivan haalanki 60 se zyada prakshepanon main shaamil rahe hai par ve kabool karte hai ki har nae launch ke vakt tanaav se ghir jate hai
 Listen to his words, "stomach starts twitching, heartbeat becomes fast and suffocating
 '' unki yah haalat us vakt or bhi zyada thi, jab 22 july ko andhra pradesh ke sriharikota main bharat ke duusare chandra abhiyaan chandrayan-2 kii ulti ginati shuru hui
 a week ago, the first attempt to launch the spacecraft had to be canceled at the last moment as the engine of the all-new, 15-floor high-level GSLV mark-iii launcher was seen to leak
 naakhush hote hue bhi sivan ne launch taalane kaa faisla kiya
 They knew that much of ISRO and India were at stake on this
 chandrayan-2 mishan 2008 main kamyaabi ke saath launch kiye gaye apane purvavarti mishan se bahut aage kii chalaang he or kai nai takneekon se las he
 The launch vehicle is the top one among them
 isro ne is abhiyaan ke liye apane jieselvi mark-iii ke istemaal kaa saahsee faisla liya, haalanki iske vikaas ke keval do charnon ke hi pareekshan hue the—chandrayan-2 kaa prakshepan isaki pehali oparational udaan thi
 In addition to the new launcher and advanced orbiter, space scientists built a lunar lander and a rover attached to it for the first time, which could carry out significant experiments around the moon's surface within a radius of half a kilometer
 yah bilkul nae jamaane kii technology hai or agar hindustan kaamyaab ho jaataa he to vah chandramaa par robotic lander chalaane vaala america, rus or china ke baad duniya kaa chauthaa desh hoga
 Sivan's second worry was that if the mess was complicated and the launch was not possible by the end of July, he would have to wait until next year for the Chandrayaan-2 mission to align the Earth and the Moon
 pehle prakshepan ko rokane ke elaan ke baad sivan ne apni team ke sadasyon se kaha, ''isro ke vaigyanik chunautiyon ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahe hai, unhone mushkil or khaas sthitiyon main behatar pradarshan kiya he
 Why not now? ”encouraged by this appeal, scientists at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center (VSSC), who built this rocket, have its director S

 somnath kii aguai main bagaiyr ruke 36 ghante kaam kiya or gadabadi kaa pataa lagaakar use durust kar diya

 jod main ai is gadabadi kii vajah se ingine main eendhan ke volve ke khulne or band hone ko niyantrit karne vaali helium botalon main dabaav khaasaa kam ho gaya tha
 Sivan told India Today, "the mess was minor, but the impact would have been disastrous if we decided to launch it without fixing it
" ''risaav vaale jod ko durust karne ke baad vaigyanikon ne launch pad par hi ek ke baad ek kai pareekshan kiye taaki dobaaraa gadabadi na hona pakkaa kar saken
 VSSC scientists, who developed isro's rocket science, made major changes to GSLV mark-iii last year so that it could lift the 4 tonne payload required for Chandrayaan-2
 is zyada unnat launture ko pehali baar aajamaaya ja rahaa tha, par viesassi kii team ne sivan ko bharosa dilaayaa ki unhen phir koi gadabadi na hone kaa pakkaa yakeen he
 ISRO chiefs knew that there is no scope of amnesty in space and that minor disturbances could result in the burial in the foothills of the Bay of Bengal of the Rs 1,000 crore Chandrayaan-2
 magar unhone july kaa avasar khatm hone se pehle ise launch karne kaa saahsee faisla liya
 Sivan says that as the countdown was approaching zero on the launch day, he felt nervous
 yah pehle charan ke baad bhi kam nahin hua, jab do vishaal booster rocket sulge or unhone antarikshayan ko uchhaalkar uske pehle se tay maarg par daal diya
 16 minutes later, when the cryogenic engine of the upper stage completed the firing process and entered the Chandrayaan-2 into the lunar orbit, he was "delighted" by relieving anxiety
 unhone apni bagal main baithe vaigyanikon se haath milaayaa or kuch ke gale mili
 By then the monitor had shown that the cryogenic engine had 'outperformed' and placed the Chandrayaan-2 at its highest orbit at 45,000 km instead of the 39,000 km predetermined
 6,000 kimi ke is phaayde se uskaa acha-khaasaa eendhan bachegaa, kyonki aisa nahin hota to is duuri ko hasil karne ke liye chandra modul ko apane saath savaar injanon ko daagna padataa
 Sivan calls it a 'bonus', while not happily holding flowers, Somnath said, "GSLV mark-iii has announced its operational capability with an even bigger bang
" ''rocket vaigyanikon kii peeth thapthapate hue bhi sivan jaanate the ki abhi aage kai chunautiyaan hai
 As he told them, "this is just the beginning of a historic journey
" '' chandrayan-2 apane 4,00,000 kimi ke safar main agast madhya main chandramaa kii kaksha se milegaa
 a few days after launch, when the engines ridden with the module completed the first task of firing it to push it to higher orbit, Sivan said he was sure that the module would arrive on the moon on time
 jab yah chand ke chaaron ore apni kaksha main khud ko sthir kar legaa, tab rover ko thaamne vaala lander orbitor se khud ko alag karegaa or 7 sitambar ko sataha par utarane ke liye apane jatil pantare puure karegaa
 Sivan calls this entire operation "15 minutes of awe" until the lander lands
 unki saansen tab bhi atakengi jab rover baahar aayega or lander ke saath chandramaa par pani ke anuon kii khoj sahit darjan bhar prayogon ko anjaam degaa
 Only after this, ISRO will announce the success of the mission
 sivan ke tanavamukt hone main abhi lanbaa vakt lagegaa
 "the 15 minutes of landing on the moon will be very awe-inspiring for us

 2019 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle gathbandhan ke saathiyon ke gile-shikave ko dur karne ke iraade se bijepi ne sampark for samarthan kaarykram chalaa rakhaa he, jiske tahat party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kal yani guuruuvaar ko patna pahunchenge or jadyu ke rashtriya adhyaksh or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se mulaakaat karenge
 Amit Shah Nitish Kumar is meeting when the leaders of both the parties have been having strong rhetoric about the coordination of seats in the Lok Sabha elections for some time
 is baat ko lekar vivaad he ki aakhir endie bandhan main bada bhai koun he jadyu yaa bhaajapa?ek din main do baar milenge shah-nitishamit shah or nitish kumaaraki hone vaali mulaakaat main sabase dilachasp baat yah he ki ek hi din main yah donon bade netaa ek baar nahin balki 2 baar mulaakaat karenge
 First time in the morning at breakfast and second time at dinner
 tay kaarykram ke mutabik amit shah subah 10:00 baje patna airport pahunchenge jiske baad vah sidhe state guest house jaaenge jahaan par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhi pahunchenge or donon netaa saath main naashtaa karenge
 Will be meeting with the party's social media team from 11:30 to 12:30 at Gyan Bhavan
 12:45 se 1:45 ke bich vah party ke vistaarakon kii baithak main hissaa lenge
 From 2:30 to 3:30 Shah will hold a meeting with the in-charge of Shakti Kendra at Bapu Auditorium
 shaam 4:00 baje se 7:00 baje tak vah chunaav taiyaari samiti ke saath state guest house main baithak karenge
 After this meeting he will go to another route where he will have dinner with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 isse pehle sampark for samarthan kaarykram ke tahagamit shahne mumbai main pichley maheene shivasena ke adhyaksh uddhav thakare se bhi mulaakaat kii thi
 But there was only one meeting with him, while Shah is to meet Nitish twice during the Patna tour
 khaas baat yah he kiamit shah or nitish kumaar kii mulakatus vakt ho rahi he jab donon dalon ke netaaon ke bich naa keval siton ke talmail ko lekar maamla fansaa hua he balki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane ko lekar or kendriya mantri giriraaj singh dwaara nitish sarkaar ko hinduon par atyaachaar karne ke gambhir aarope lagane ko lekar vivaad charam par he
 Recently, Nitish Kumar also took a U-turn on the decision of demonetisation and questioned the benefits of it
 jahaan tak siton ke talmail kaa sawaal he, pichley kuch vakt ke dauraan jadyu ne saaf kah diya he ki unhen 40 main se 25 loksabhaa siten kam se kam ladane ke liye milani chahie
 JDU believes that the formula for the seat-sharing formula between JDU and BJP in 2009 should be repeated in 2019 also i
e
 JDU contested on 25 seats and BJP in 15 seats
 jadyu ne yah bhi maang kii he ki bihar main loksabhaa chunaav nitish kumaar ke chehre ko aage rakhkar ladaa jaae kyonki pradesh main jadyu hi bada bhai he

 Earlier it was sometimes that we did not go home on any festival
 ab aisa aksar hota he ki ham ghar se baahar hote hai or parv-tyohaar biit jate hai
 We are gradually growing up and getting away from our roots even faster
 ab sapanom main gaanv kii pagadendi, aam-jamun ke bageeche, taal-pokhar or dugadugi bajaate madari nahin aate
 Now dreams have also become selective
 naukari-selary-aprijal-pramotion ne jindagi main charas bo diya he
 The affair of growing up has made a big mess
 badhati jimmedaariyon ne hamen kitna gairjimmedaarana bana diya he
 Now even cannabis does not climb on the head
 naukari kaa nasha hi kuch is kadar sir chadh gaya he ki utaare nahin utarataa
 At first, he used to think that he would stay at home after studying
 ab zyada pard-likh liya he gaanv-ghar hi dur hota ja rahaa he
 The life of the village-house is starting to get very slow and we are spending our time adjusting ourselves to the fast pace of the metros
 aakhir, gaanv-kasbe, maa-babuji, bhaiya-bhabhi, se dur ek kiraye ke kamare main raat ke dauraan chat se latake pankhe ko takate rahane main koi majaa he bhala
 Earlier, he used to think that he would earn money and buy a radio and listen to the news every morning and evening
 ab smart phone saath he, ham soshal media kii abhaasi duniya par hameshaa maujuud hai or vaastavik duniya se katate chale ja rahe hai
 Now when we are on social media, even after watching hundreds of colleagues online, i do not feel like talking to anyone
 kisi kii tasviren or states padhane kaa man nahin karata
 Earlier, after getting 2G data filled, people used to chat with people in such a way that they would not meet after this
 ab 3G speed bhi lubhaa nahin paata
 Earlier there used to be a channel and there was no film left on it
 ab letest filmein aati rahati hai or ham unhen chhodte chale jate hai
 In childhood, new clothes were required at every festival, now they are earning themselves
 acount main hameshaa hajaaron rupee hote hai or ham vahi puraani shart or genes har maukey-bemauke pahan lete hai
 To make yourself feel connected to the roots, sometimes you wrap a towel and sometimes wear a kurta and slippers and go for a walk in the mall
 mahanagaron main log aise dekhte hai jaise ham kisi or grah ke praani hon, magar ve kya jaane ki ham kis phej se guzar rahe hai
 What is the pain of being away from home on the occasion of a festival
 to aise saare aadhunik girmitiyaa mazdooron ko duusare girmitiyaa majdoor kii ore se rangaparv kii hardik shubhakamanaayen

 chunki company ab 4G par focus kar rahi he, isliye dhire dhire shaayad duusari jagahon se bhi 3G shatdown kiya ja saktaa he
 According to the report, now high speed 4G broadband will be available in the city
 company ne 3G ke liye yuj kiye ja rahe 900 mhz band spectrum ko rifrem karke apane 4G network ko behatar kar rahi he
 Airtel is using state of the art L900 technology for the 900mhz band for 4G service
 bharti airtel ke chif technolji officer ne kaha he, ‘ham bharat main apane sabhi 3G spectrum ko rifrem karne kii planning kar rahe hai or ise charanbaddh tareeke se 4G ke liye diploy karenge
 Apart from this, it will also benefit the smartphone ecosystem which is now moving towards 4G only devices' Airtel may be discontinuing the 3G service in Kolkata, but the company will continue the 2G service
 chunki feechar phone yugers ke paas 4G yuj karne kaa opshan hi nahin he, isliye company un customers ke liye 2G jari rakhana chaahati he
 The company has given notifications to all 3G customers to upgrade their handsets and sims so that more 4G services can be used
 kolkata ke airtel ke kuch customers ko is khabar se pareshaani jarur ho sakati he
 Because a few years ago there was a craze for 3G handsets and people still have 3G only smartphones
 aise main wo jaahir he 3G yuj nahin kar paaenge or unhen 2G se kaam chalaanaa hoga
 However, 4G smartphones are now affordable, so people can have some ease in upgrading to 4G smartphones
 india today-karvi ke mood of da nesan july 2018 pole (MOTN, july 2018) ke mutabik agar aaj chunaav hote hai tobijepisbase badi party banakar ubhar rahi, lekin bahumat ke jaadui aankade se dur rahegi
 In such a situation, its dependence on its allies will increase
 is survey main piem narendramodior party ke liye chetavanee ke sanket saaf najar aa rahe hai
 Let us tell you that this survey was conducted among 12,100 people from 97 parliamentary constituencies and 197 assembly constituencies
 survey 18 july 2018 se lekar 29 july 2018 ke bich karaayaa gaya tha
 1
 According to Jatakindia today-karvy's Mood of the Nation survey, BJP is seen getting 245 seats out of 543 Lok Sabha seats
 jabaki 2014 ke chunaav main 282 siten mili thi
 In this way, 37 seats are seen decreasing compared to the last election
 is tarah se bijepi ko apane dam par 272 siton ke bahumat ke aankade se 27 siten kam mil rahi hai
 2- Now, with the help of the ally, the government will look at the survey, then the BJP will need the support of allies to form the government
 haalanki bijepi ke netritv vaale endie ko survey main 281 siten mil rahi hai
 The UPA is getting 122 seats in its account
 jabaki anya sahyogi dalon ke khate main shesh 140 siten aane kii ummid he
 3- There will be difficulty in taking big decisions
 The present Modi government does not have to depend on allies
 lekin bahumat se kam siten hone ke naate sahyogi dalon par nirbharta or badhegi
 In this way, before making big and tough decisions, they also have to consult with allies
 iske baad hi koi kadam uthaa paaenge
 While this is not the case right now
 yahi vajah thi ki piem modi ne notebandi jaise kade faisle le sake hai
 If the results of the survey change in the election results, then the attitude of the government will also change
 4- ye sameekaran bane to bijepi ko mushkil ho jaegisrve ke mutabik sapa, basapa, tiemasi, tidipi or pidipi jaise dal agar congress netritv vaale upie ke saath milakar chunaav ladate hai to aise main aankade chaunkaane vaale ho sakate hai
 There will be a fight between the NDA and the grand alliance
 aisi surat main endie ko 255 siten or upie ko 242 siten mil sakati hai
 While others may get 46 seats
 is trishanku sthiti main donon gathbandhanon ko anya saansadon ke saath laane kii badi chunauti hogi
 5- pm's choice at number two Narendra Modi's magic as the next most preferred leader of India
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii 27 fisadi kii tulana main modi kii lokapriyata 49 fisadi he
 Apart from these two leaders, the third choice is Priyanka Gandhi who has got just 3 percent votes
 bhale hi piem pad par pehali pasand modi hai, lekin jis tarah se rahul kaa graph badha he
 That is a danger bell for the BJP

 5 Director: Teenu Suresh Desai Kalakar: Akshay Kumar, Ileana d'cruz, Isha Gupta and Pawan Malhotra are going to see 'rustam' thinking that it is based on a true event
 yah sirf nanaavati cond se prerit he, baaki film kalpana ke sahare gadhi gai he, or paatro ko bollywood style main poshit kiya gaya he
 In the same style as has been done for centuries
 diarector ne achche thriller or suspence kaa chhaunk lagane kii koshish kii he, lekin vah bollywood kii bandhi-bandhai paripati ko langhane main safal nahin rahe hai, or ek navy officer kii bivi ke vivahetar sambandhon ke nae concept ko ve bollywood me lekar to aae, lekin uske saath us tarah kaa bold treetment nahin kar sake jaisi ummid thi
 Rustom is a bit long and why the director has released it on the weekend of August 15, it will be understood by watching the film
 suspence factor kahani ke mutabik nahin balki diarector or bollywood ke mutabik chalata he
 How powerful in the story is Kumarayani Rustom a brave soldier of the Indian Navy
 vah apane desh se pyaar karata he or ghar se zyada samay use apane kartavya ko puraa karte hue bitaana hota he
 When he comes back to his house before the appointed time, he sees that his wife is not at home
 use ghar se gaye 24 ghante se zyada kaa vakt ho gaya he
 He sets out to find his wife
 bivi (eliana decruige) ko ek shaks ke saath dekhtaa he
 He kills that person (arjan Bajwa)
 iske baad shuru hota he court room drama
 The story is inspired by the Nananti case, not exactly the same
 film main pehle half main jo samaa bandhaa tha vah ant aane tak utana asardaar nahin rahata he
 The story and screenplay of the film is not of Neeraj Pandey's level
 diarector har baat kii jo bollywood style vajah dene kii koshish karata he, vah atakati he
 Ileana's character could be very strong and the life of the film too
 lekin diarector kaa puraa focus to superstar akshay kumaar par tha
 Star appealakshay Kumar is the Bollywood star who brings three to four films in a year
 is saal vah 'airlift', 'housephul-3' ke baad ab 'rustam' lekar aae hai
 He has acted just as he has been doing
 rustam ke kirdaar main jamate hai lekin jaisaa aksar unke saath hota he
 Sometimes his stone face causes problems
 unke chehre par bhav aana ekadam se band ho jate hai
 It is with many Bollywood stars
 eliana decruige apane role main jami hai or sundar dikhti hai
 Isha Gupta is absolutely socialite and the focus of the camera is more on her puff and sexy style than her acting
 pawan malhotra kii acting bhi acchhee he or arjuna bajva ko jitna kaam mila unhone use bakhubi nibhaayaa
 The music of 'rustom' is a good thing for earning
 starcast badi he or niraj pandeya jaisaa naam film se judaa hua he, phir vah beshak bataur produsar hi kyon na ho
 His record with Akshay has been good
 'special 26' or 'baby' hit rahi hai
 The budget of the film is around 50 crores
 he, jisamen akshay kumaar kii fees shaamil nahin he
 However, it competes with the mega budget film Mohenjo Daro
 in donon filmon ke mukaable ko dekhte hue 'dilavaale' or 'bajirao mastaani' kaa muqabla yaad jaataa he
 In which 'dilwale' was released on more screens and 'bajirao' on less
 lekin baaji 'bazaariv' ne maari thi
 'mohenjo Daro' is also releasing on more screens and 'rustom' on less
 dekhnaa he ki is baar kya ibaarat likhi jaati he? Anushka Sharma is going to be seen in horror in the upcoming film Pari
 ye suspence film he, jisamen anoushka kaa saaya dikhaai detaa he
 His film will be released on 2 March 2018
 anoushka ne apane instagram acount par ek video share kiya he
 It tells how the actress who played Anushka's shadow in the fairy, how her makeup was done
 mechap artist ke anusaar, isamen Prosthetic makeup kaa kam istemaal hua he
 Anushka told that when she saw the makeup of this character, she could not believe it
 Looks can be deceiving! Watch the horror unmask

 In the face of Anushka, there is actually a devil sitting on the grill who is waiting for his next creepy move
 Pari trailer: holi par horer, khaufnak khel khilne niklaa shaitanushka ne is tiger ko share karte hue jis tarah se capshan likhaa he phans bhi usee andaaj main iskaa jawaab dete najar aa rahe hai

 rashtriya pashu kii padavi par baagh kii hi badshahath bani rahegi
 Yes, this is made clear by the reply given by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India on an RTI application filed by Aishwarya Parashar (13), resident of Lucknow

 The revelation of Aishwarya's RTI has led to a full stop on speculation
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki jharkhand se rajyasabha saansad parimaal nathavani ne rashtriya pashu ko baagh se badalakar sher ko banane kaa ek prastaav 'neshnal board for wild life' ko bheja tha
 The Ministry too had shown interest in this proposal

 rampur main vakf bhoomi par nazaij tareeke se dukaane nirmaan karai gayi or johar vishvavidhyalay main jabaran vakf bhoomi ko shaamil kiya gaya
 He said that to build the road to Jauhar University, the minister fully dug up Shia cemetery and got the road constructed
 in sabhi beyimaanion kii jaanch ho or beyimaanon ko jarur sajaa milani chahie
 The comments moulana ne kaha ki mukhyamantri yogi adityanath bhrashtachar ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai to sabase zyada bhrashtachar shiya va sunni vakf board main hua he, isliye uski jaanch karakar bhrashtachariyon ko dandit karnaa jaruri he
 Maulana said that any government can remain on the basis of Kufr, but cannot live on the basis of oppression
 sapa sarkaar kaa safaya uske atyaachaar ke aadhaar par hi hua he
 Reacting to the action being taken on the corrupt people in the Yogi government on Friday, he said that all unscrupulous people should be investigated and punished
 majalis-e-ulema-e-hind ke mahasachiv moulana kalbe javwaad ne kaha, "hamaari maang aaj bhi yahi he ki vakf board ke kaamkaaj kii sibiai jaanch ho, taaki beyimaanon or bhrashtachariyon ko sajaa mili
 "maulana said that Waqf land has been extensively excavated throughout Uttar Pradesh, evidence of which exists
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki purv vakf mantri ajam khan vakf bhoomi main hue bhrashtachar or beyimaanion main puri tarah shaamil hai
 Shops were illegally constructed on Wakf land in Rampur and forcibly Waqf land was included in Jauhar University
 unhone kaha ki johar vishvavidhyalay kii sadak banane ke liye pakshpaat purna dhang se mantri ne shiya kabristaan khudwakar sadak kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 All these unscrupulous people should be investigated and the unscrupulous must be punished

 moulana ne kaha ki koi bhi sarkaar kufr kii binah par baaki rah sakati he, lekin julm ke aadhaar par baaki nahin rah sakati
 The SP government has been wiped out on the basis of its atrocities

 Sonal Chauhan Budha Hoga, who has made headlines in Bollywood with Jannat, is knocking once again after your father
 is baar darshakon ko khinchne ke liye unhone horer-thriller 3ji main boldnes ko hathiyaar banaaya he

 After the colorful opening ceremony on Tuesday at the Salt Lake Stadium, it is the turn of the sixth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL)
 udghaatan mukaable main buudhvaar ko mejabaan or maujuuda championkolkata nite rirds team kaa saamana eden garden stadium main dilli dairedevillske saath hoga
 Under the leadership of Gautam Gambhir, the Knight Riders would like to make a successful start to their campaign, while the Daredevils, who had advanced to the playoffs last year, would like to start with a win
 pehle match main hi donon ke liye kuch mushkilen paidaa ho gai hai kyonki donon tiimon ke kuch pramukh khilaadi nahin khel rahe hai
 While Knight Riders will have to start the campaign without their star batsman Brendon mccullum and fast bowler James Pattinson, the Daredevils will have to try to win without their former captain Virender Sehwag and star bowler Morne Morkel
 shuruaati chaar sanskarnon main niraashajanak pradarshan ke baad nite rirds ne beete saal khitaabi jeet ke saath apni niraashaa ko dho diya tha, lekin ab uske saamne khitaab ke saath-saath saakh bachaane kii gambheer chunauti he
 Captain Gambhir is not in good form
 kharaab farm ke kaaran hi vah bhartiya team se baahar hai or ab to shikhar dhawan ke udbhav ke baad unke niyamit sthaan par bhi khatra he
 Despite this, Gambhir can make his team successful again in the IPL
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki unke paas kuch behad stareey khilaadi or ek acha sport staff he
 Coach Trevor Bellis proved his utility as a coach in the Big Bash League, succeeding the Sydney Sixers, and then brought the Knight Riders to the ground in 2012
 sahaayak coach vijay dahia, gendbaaji menter brett lee, fielding coach trevor penny or physio andrew lipas ke rahete nite rirds shahrukh ke bharose ko kaayam rakh sakate hai lekin iske liye unhen shandaar taiyaari ke saath behtareen khel dikhaanaa hoga
 On the other hand, Daredevils captain Mahela Jayawardene would like to challenge the defending champions without some of their key players (morkel, Sehwag and Kevin Pietersen) and they still have enough resources for this
 jayavardhane, david warner, andra rasel, naman ojha, unmukt chand or yogesh nagar ke rup main dairedevills ke paas achche ballebaaj hai jabaki umesh yadav, shahbaaj nadeem, siddharth kaul ke rup main stareey gendbaaj hai
 Apart from this, the Daredevils team, which played semi-finals in 2008 and 2009, has two-level all-rounders in the form of Johan Botha and Irfan Pathan, who can help the team win by bowling and batting
 
 In particular, Jayawardene, Warner, Russell and Morkel will have the responsibility to win the Daredevils in the first match

 sansad main gatirodh ke liye congress ne mangalvaar ko sattadhari dal bijepi ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 The Congress alleged that bjp's allies are creating a deadlock in Parliament and no initiative is being taken to negotiate with the opposition leaders except to persuade them from the government
 congress ne kaha ki sarkaar sansad main charchaa se bhaag rahi he or vipaksh ko sadan main uski baat kehane kaa mauka nahin diya ja rahaa he
 Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said that since the second phase of the budget session of Parliament has started, the Congress has been trying to raise the issue related to PNB scam and its accused Nirav Modi through an adjournment motion
 iske liye party kii ore se baraabar notice bhi diya ja rahaa he
 Not getting a chance in the house, Moukhakharge said that the government does not want to discuss under the adjournment motion

 unhone kaha ki yah loktantr ke liye kalank kii baat he
 He said that if the opposition was running away from the discussion then why would it have given notice of discussion on the adjournment motion? Used to be done

 The entire emphasis of the BJP is on Varanasi as the BJP is struggling with differences after ticket distribution
 yahi vajah he ki banaras main tufaani sabha kar raheen smriti irani har sabha main banaras ke logon ko ghat or banaras kii andekhi mudda uthaa rahi hai or sirf smriti irani hi nahin balki bijepi kaa har bada mantri in dinon banaras main aisi hi sabha kar rahaa he kyonki bijepi ko dar he ki tikat bantwaare kaa asantosh main kahin seat haath se na nikal jaye
 Its voice was also heard when Shyam Dev Rai Chaudhary, a seven-time MLA, was denied a ticket
 dada naaraaz the unhen kai tarah ke aashwaasan die gaye
 Now they are ready for publicity, but there is still mild resentment in the voice
 gauratlab he ki banaras bijepi kaa garh mana jaataa he lekin jis tarah tikat banta usase bada ashantosh paidaa hua
 Shyam Dev Rai Chaudhary, a seven-time MLA in the city Dakshin, got his ticket cut
 iske saath hi duusare daavedaar shahar dakshini se hi 2012 ke chunaav main congress se lagbhag 45000 vot paakar duusare sthaan par rahe dayashankar mishra dayaaloo bhi congress se bijepi aaye unako bhi tikat nahin mila
 The same situation also happened in the Cantt Assembly, where 5 times people from the same family got tickets, which angered the worker
 jaankaar kehete hai ki tikat bantwaare main sangh kii chali he
 Taking this point further, journalist Himanshu Sharma further said that when the BJP leaders with tickets did not get the ticket and those who are close to the Sangh got tickets, then it is clear that the Sangh may not have anything to do with BJP politics
 You talk about being, but its complete interference is clearly visible
 tippaniyan This dissatisfaction of ticket distribution is also haunting BJP because BJP had put forward a winning streak by adding a straw to win Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 in tinako main duusari partiyon ke diggazon ko bhi bade aashwaasan dekar party main shaamil karaayaa tha
 Therefore, the people of those parties are facing opposition party if they do not get tickets
 asantosh kii khai pataane ke liye bijepi ne apni puri takat jhonk di he
 Amit Sah is camping here and the Prime Minister can also give more time here
 tikat bantwaare ke alaava banaras main vaade ke hisaab se kaam na hone ke asantosh kaa dar bhi bijepi ko sata rahaa he
 Therefore, the work under the Heart Scheme and Amrit Yojana is also being dealt with quickly as Banaras is the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 yahaan kii paramparaagat seat haarane ke bade myne honge or virdohi bhi jam kar gherenge
 Hence BJP does not want to lose it at any cost
 iskaa swar bhi saat baar ke vidhayak rahe shyaam dev raay choudhary ko tikat na milane par sunai diya tha
 Dada was angry he was given many assurances
 ab wo prachaar ke liye taiyaar to ho gayi hai par swar main abhi bhi halki naaraazgi najar aati he
 Significantly, Banaras is considered to be a BJP stronghold, but the way the ticket was divided created a lot of uneasiness
 shahar dakshini main saat baar ke vidhayak rahe shyaam dev raay choudhary kaa tikat cat gaya
 With this, Dayashankar Mishra Dayalu, who came second to the BJP from Congress, did not get a ticket from second contender city Dakshin, after getting nearly 45000 votes from Congress in the 2012 election
 yahi haal cant vidhansabha kaa bhi rahaa jahaan 5 dafe se ek hi parivaar ke logon ko tikat mila jisase kaaryakarta naaraaz ho gaya
 Experts say that the Sangh has been involved in ticket distribution
 is baat ko patrkaar himanshu sharma or aage badhaate hue bataate hai ki jab tikat janaadhar vaale bijepi ke netaaon ko nahin mila or sangh se kareebi rishte waalon ko tikat mil gaya to saafe he ki sangh bhale hi apane ko bijepi kii raajnneeti se koi lenaa dena na hone kii baat kahati ho par uskaa puraa dakhal saafe dikhataa he
 The comments tikat bantwaare kaa ye asantosh bijepi ko isaliye bhi sata rahaa he kyonki 2014 loksabhaa ke chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko jitaane ke liye bhaajapa ne tinkaa tinkaa jodakar jeet kaa kaaravaan aage badhaayaa tha
 In these Tinko, the stalwarts of other parties were also included in the party with great assurance
 lihaaja un partiyon se aaye logon ko tikat na milane par unka bhi virodh party ko jhelana pad rahaa he
 To bridge the gap of dissatisfaction, BJP has given its full strength
 amit saah yahaan camp kar rahe hai or pradhanmantri bhi yahaan zyaada samay de sakate hai
 Apart from ticket distribution, the fear of dissatisfaction of not working as promised in Varanasi is also haunting BJP
 lihaaja hryday yojana or amrit yojana ke tahat jaldi jaldi kaam ko niptaya bhi ja rahaa he kyonki banaras pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa sansadeey kshetra he
 Losing the traditional seat here will mean a lot and opponents will also surround it fiercely
 lihaaja bijepi kisi bhi keemat par ise haarana nahin chaahati

 However, there are some people who are carrying the corpse of communalism of both colors in the same way as the monkey's mother wanders around by sticking her dead child to the chest
 bijepi sirf ayodhya main nahin haari he

 In provinces like Gujarat to Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the BJP is trying to maintain itself as a party of good governance
 yahaan tak ki shivasena kaa bhi kaam hindu or musalmaan antarvirodh se nahin chal paaya or use uttar pradesh or bihar ke logon ke rup main ek nayaa shatru pesh karnaa padaa
 Actually, politics is also not untouched by the law of change of nature

 Not only this, leaders like Lalu Prasad Yadav, Sushil Kumar Modi, Sharad Yadav, and Mulayam Singh Yadav in Bihar, who started politics against the Congress, shone, although before the politics of all these, the opposition of Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan Congress Was inspired by

 The success of his politics increased the political ambitions of the obcs and other castes
 lekin raajnneeti main na to kabhi shunya rahata he na hi raajnneeti kii dagar chunautiyon se khaali rahati he
 Nitish, who is studying politics with him, was challenged by Lalu, who ruled for 15 years from the muslim-yadav (M) alliance in Bihar
 amir-garib or jatiyon main bante rajya main nitish ne apni soshal ejineering kaa kamaal dikhaaya or rashtriya party bijepi ko satta main duusare sthaan par santosh karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 Bihar may have been backward in economic matters, but both of them and especially Ram Vilas Paswan had created political awareness among the backward
 isi kaa nateeja he ki march 1990 main congress sarkaar ke baad se rajya main abhi tak koi savarna mukhyamantri nahin bana he
 These leaders also challenged the dominance of Brahmins in religious matters

 But overall he did not challenge Hinduism

 It happens to almost every girl that despite having a wardrobe full of clothes, she feels that she has nothing to wear
 aap ek-ek karke almaari ke saare kapade bistar par failaa detii hai or uske baad sir pakadakar baith jaati hai
 After sitting on the head, some similar thoughts will also come in your mind which are being mentioned here: 1: Where did my clothes go? You think there is something missing in your wardrobe
 aap sochati hai ki aapke paas kuch kapade to aise the jinhen pahanakar aap aaj kii party main ja sakati thim
 You think that your sister or room-partner might have stolen your dress
 2
 How poor i am! Despite the full wardrobe, you think how poor you are
 aapke alaava har kisi ke paas kapade hai sirf aap hi he, jo itani garib hai
 3
 kya soch ke kharid liya thrub jabaki aapke paas bazaar jane kaa samay nahin he or party main janaa bhi jaruri he to aap apni unheen dresses main se ek nikaalati hai or pahanane kii koshish karti hai
 Standing in front of the mirror after wearing, what do you think you bought such a bad dress
 4
 Nobody likes me
 Your biggest worry is that if you have not gone in good clothes, no one will pay attention to you
 logon ko aapse zyada aapaki dress dekhne main interest hoga
 They won't even let you go near you
 5
 Why such bad things only happen to me is your last thought
 aapako ye lagane lagata he ki duniya kii sari buree chijen sirf aapke saath hi hoti hai
 You are all alone and there is no one to help you

 Munna Kumar Sharma, national general secretary of Hindu Mahasabha and editor of 'hindu Sabha Dialogue', said that 'love Jihad' is an anti-hindu conspiracy

 Munna Kumar further said that Sharmila Tagore, Kareena Kapoor, Gauri Chhibber, Reena Dutt, Kiran Rao were forced into Islam and converted to Islam

 This time there is a tough fight in West Bengal (west Bengal) with 42 Lok Sabha seats
 bijepi(bjp) ne 23 siten jeetne kaa lakshya rakhaa he to mamata banerjee(mamata Banerjee) use ek bhi seat dene ke mood main nahin hai
 This is the most polarized election till date in the state, which has also witnessed a political confrontation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi) and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
 bijepi yahaan loksabhaa siton ko jeetne ke liye koi bhi mauka chuknaa nahin chaahati
 Under this strategy, party president Amit Shah and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have been campaigning in the state at regular intervals
 paramparaagat rup se, bhaajapa kii bengal main nunatam upasthiti he
 Initially the main fight here was between the Congress and the Left
 congress ne rajya par 35 saal shashan kiya
 And later the Left parties and Trinamool did
 pichley kuch varshon main, congress or vamadalon kii tulana main bijepi ne bengal kii raajnneeti main apane liye bada sthaan taiyaar kiya he
 However in terms of seats, it has two seats in the Lok Sabha and three in the Assembly in the state
 1996 or 2014 ke bich, congress or trinmul ne vot share ke maamle main ek duusare se sthanon kii adla-badali kii
 The figures testify to this fact
 misaal ke taur par dekhen to 1996 main 40 pratishat vot share rakhane vaali congress 2014 tak aate-aate das pratishat tak pahunch gai, vahiin 1996 main 10 pratishat vot share vaali trinmul congress 2014 main 40 pratishat ke aankade par pahunch gai
 Similarly, as the Left parties weakened from the politics of West Bengal, the BJP began to rise in the same proportion in 2011
 jab trinmul ne teen dashakon se kabiz vam shashan kaa ant kar diya
 In 2014, bjp's voter share increased by 13 per cent compared to 2011, while the Left fell by 12 per cent
 rajya main saat charnon main loksabhaa ke matdaan ho rahe hai
 In areas where BJP is considered strong, votes have been cast in the first two phases
 tisare charan ke liye hue matdaan vaali siton par congress kii pakad majboot he
 In the last stages, votes are to be held in places where the Trinamool Congress has a stronger base than other parties
 bengal ke chunaav ko is baar aayu varg, dharm, jati or ling ke aadhaar par vibhajit aabaadi ne dilachasp bana diya he
 The trends from the analyzes conducted by Pranab Roy and his team suggest that Muslim votes are quite divided in Bengal
 jahaan unki aabaadi shesh bharat ke 14 pratishat se doguni 28 pratishat he
 In the last general election, the Trinamool Congress received 40 percent of the Muslim vote
 left ko tees or congress ko 20 pratishat or anya ko aath fisad
 The trends in this election suggest that Muslim votes are getting less divided
 trinmul, jisane muslim matadaataaon ke liye kai upaay kiye hai, ko musalamaanon kaa 70 pratishat vot milane kii sambhaavna he
 The Congress is likely to get 20 and the Left only five percent of the Muslim vote
 yah trends ke aadhaar par aankalan kiya gaya he
 The Muslim population in Bengal is spread across the state in place of a particular pocket
 data se pataa chalata he ki mamata banerjee kii party ne un siton par behatar pradarshan kiya he, jahaan muslim aabaadi zyada nahin he
 In 2014, the Trinamool received 27 percent of the votes in seats where more than 20 percent were Muslims
 vahiin non muslim siton par 42 pratishat vot mili
 The bjp's aggressive election campaign may lead the Trinamool Congress to face solidarity with Hindu votes
 trends yah bhi bataate hai ki trinmul congress kaa vot share shahari ilaakon kii tulana main gaanvon main zyada he
 While upper-class voters tend to lean towards the BJP, the tribals have an inclination towards Mamata Banerjee's party
 trends ke mutabik 18 se 23 saal ke yuva voters bijepi ko zyada saport kar rahe hai
 While the Trinamool Congress supporters are aged between 33 and 50 years
 pashchim bengal main hawa kaa rukh bhaanpakar vot karne vaali kul aath siten hai, jinhone usee dal ko jitayaa, jisaki rajya main sarkaar rahi

 Along with the poets Kedarnath Agarwal, Trilochan and Nagarjuna are important pillars of the trilogy of progressive poets

 Along with the truth of life, his words come from playing with the beauty of nature

 There is a flow of music in the poems of Kedarnath Agarwal
 kavitaayen chaahe udaasi kii hon, ullas kii, sangharsh kii yaa siyasat kii
 Ashok Tripathi, who works on the poems of Kedar Ji, says that Kedar is the poet of the earth - the poet of fields, barns, factories, and courts
 in sabake dukh-dard, sangharsh or harsh ke kavi hai
 They are in favor of the suffering and exploited human being
 ve manushya ke kavi hai
 Being and creating human beings was the greatest practice and practice of his life and poet-work
 
 
 
 Regarding his poems, Kedarnath Agarwal himself said that i am not opposed to the new poem, i am opposed to all its elements which make him not a poem, 'brain deformity' and 'one-sided figure'
 nai upamaaon, nae sparshon ke dharaatal, nae aakaar, nai grahanshiltaa aadi sabakaa swaagat he
 Today, two of his best poems for readers of 'sahitya Aaj Tak' on his birth anniversary

 Basanti is the wind, i am the wind
 suno baat meri -anokhi hawa hoon
 i am very mad, very good man
 nahin kuch phikar he,badi hi nidar hoon
 Wherever i want, i roam there, i am a stranger
 na ghar-baar meraa,na uddeshy meraa,na ichha kisi kii,na aashaa kisi kii,na premi na dushman,jidhar chaahati hoonudhar gumti hoon
 i am the wind, i am the wind; i went from where i went to - city, village, township, river, sand, uninhabited, green fields, puddle, swinging
 jhumaati chali main!hawa hoon, hawa mabasanti hawa hoon
 Climbed the tree Mahua, made a thumping; Then from the fall Dhamma, again climbed the mango, shaken it too, 'koo' in the ear, descended, and i reached the green field - there, there was plenty of wheat
 pahar do pahar kya,anekon pahar takisi main rahi main!khadi dekh alsolie sheesh kalsi,mujhe khub suujhi -hilaayaa-jhulayagiri par na kalsi!isi haar ko paa,hilaai na sarson,jhulaai na sarson,hawa hoon, hawa mambsanti hawa hoon!mujhe dekhte huarhari lajaai,manaaya-banaaya,na maani, na maani;use bhi na choda -pathik aa rahaa tha,usee par dhakela;hansee jor se main,hansee sab dishaaen,hanse lahalhatehre khet saare,hansee chamchamatibhari dhoop pyaari;basanti hawa menhansee sristi sari!hawa hoon, hawa mambsanti hawa hoon!2
 Our lives are the days of our lives, the days of great struggle! Always work, but you get less price
 pratikshan ham bure shashan-bure shoshan se pisate hai!!apadh, agyaan, adhikaron sevanchit ham kalapate hai
 Walking on the road wears a lot of footwear
 hamaari jindagi ke din,hamaari glani ke din hai!!hamaari jindagi ke din,bade sangharsh ke din hai!na dana ek miltaa he,khalaye pet phirte hai
 The locks of the profiteering warehouse do not open
 vikal, behaal, bhukhe hamatadapate ou' tarasate hai
 Our stomach refuses charity
 hamaari jindagi ke din,hamaari bhukh ke din hai!!hamaari jindagi ke din,bade sangharsh ke din hai!nahin miltaa kahin kapadaa,langoti ham pahante hai
 Only the weights of our women are visible
 hajaaron aadmi ke shavkafan tak ko tarasate hai
 The unclothed chadra moves through the open desert
 hamaari jindagi ke din,hamaari laaj ke din hai!!hamaari jindagi ke din,bade sangharsh ke din hai!hamaare desh main ab bhi,videshi ghaat karte hai
 Big kings, commoners, delight us
 hamen insaan ke badale,adham sookar samajhate hai
 Putting the throat tighten the rope law
 hamaari jindagi ke din,hamaari kaid ke din hai!!hamaari jindagi ke din,bade sangharsh ke din hai!iraadaa kar chuke hai ham,pratigya aaj karte hai
 In the Himalayas and the ocean, new storms form
 gulaami ko masal dengen hatyaron se darate hai
 We have to live free, we die today

 maujuuda vitt varsh ke liye sarkaar ne yah ummid lagaai he ki bajet kaa aakaar pichley saal se 4
 76 lakh crore rupees increased to 27
 86 lakh karod rupye ho jayega
 But economists believe that the falling rate of economic growth and the inflation rate of 3–3
 5 fisad ke bich rahane kii sambhaavna ke bich is lakshya ko paanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Significantly, the government's revenue in the first quarter 2
 9 lakh karod rupye rahaa, jo kul tay lakshya ke 13
 Is equal to 9 percent
 aise main rigerv bank se mil rahe atirikt paise kaa istemaal, sarkaar apane rajasav lakshya ko puraa kar rajkoshiya ghate ko kaabo main kare yaa arthvyavastha main jaan foonkane ke liye, is par gaharaa asamanjas he
 Perhaps this is why Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman could not explain the use of this money to any concrete strategy
 karvi stock broking ke arthshaastri rajeev singh kehete hai, ''rigerv bank se mil rahe rajasav kaa istemaal sarkaar ko infrastracchar se judi pariyojnaon main karnaa chahie
 "this will boost demand in many areas and relief is expected on the tax revenue front as well
 par ve bhi duvidha jataate hai, ''rajkoshiya ghate ko saadhaa jaae yaa puunjigat vyay shuru kiye jaaen? yah pehle murga aayaa yaa anda jaisi kahani he
 "the government itself can return confidence in the economy only by starting large investments
" sarkari nivesh se hi aarthik vikaas dar ko rakrataar di ja sakati he
 The government is actually getting an additional Rs 58,000 crore from the Reserve Bank as the government had set a target of Rs 90,000 crore for receipts from the Reserve Bank in the budget
 maujuuda 1,76,051 karod kii raashi isse 86,000 karod rupye zyada he
 Out of this, 28,000 crore rupees have already been given as interim dividend by the Reserve Bank in FY 2019
 sarplus transfer kaa pechasarkaar lambey samay se rigerv bank se sarplus hastantarit karne kii maang kar rahi thi
 But former Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel and Deputy Governor Viral Acharya were not in this favor
 sarkaar or arabiai ke bich isi takaraav ko khatm karne ke liye purv governor bimal jalaan kii adhyakshata main ek samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 After this Urjit Patel resigned even before the term was over
 rashtriya lok vitt evam niti santhaan kii salaahkaar or arthshaastri radhika pandey kahati hai, ''kendriya bank kitna sarplus sarkaar ko hastantarit kare, iske liye duniyabar main tay maanak he
 "but the Reserve Bank Act in India empowers the central bank to decide on surplus transfers
" radhika kahati hai, ''kendriya bank ke sarplus kii nitiyon par bahes honi chahie or unhen kanoon main shaamil kiya janaa chahie'' kendriya bank kaa sarplus hameshaa sarkaar or bank ke bich vivaad kaa mudda rahata he
 The Jalan Committee's recommendations will be helpful in setting these standards
 idhar vipaksh, sarkaar ko rigerv bank se mil rahe is sarplus kaa hawala dete hue arthvyavastha ke khastahal hone kaa daawa kar rahaa he
 Targeting the government, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said, "the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are unable to solve the economic crisis created by their mistakes
" rigerv bank se dhan hadapney kaa tarika kaam nahin aayega
 It is like stealing a band-aid from a dispensary and applying it to a wound caused by a bullet

 ' When Tyler Clementi jumped from the George Washington Bridge in New York to the 200-foot-deep Hudson River on September 22, 2010, he not only gave his life, but also put his roommate Darun Ravi's life in trouble
 ye donon 18 varshiya chaatr piskatwe, neujersey kii ratgers uniwarsity main padhate the or is ghatana se ek maheenaa pehle hi ek-duusare se mili the
 Ravi has been living in America for many years
 juri 21 farvari ko yah faisla karegi ki ravi niztaa ke atikaraman, duraagrahpurn dhaunsabaji, sakshya se chhedchhad or giraftaar yaa abhiyojan se bachane ke 15 maamalon main doshi he yaa nahin
 Clementi was gay and lived in the same room with Ravi
 isi kamare main 19 sitambar ko ek hi kamare main duusare vyakti ke saath climanti ke kathith kriyalap ko ravi ke computer par webacam se kaid kiya tha
 According to the statement of Ravi's lawyer, his client, along with one of his friends and student Molly Wei, witnessed the sexual intercourse between Clementi and the man in her room for two seconds
 iske baad usne twit kiya, ''ichet chaalu kiijie or mere rummet ko ek chaila ke saath yonkriya karte hue dekhie
 Ravi allegedly tried to revisit the scene on 21 September
 lekin climanti ne ravi ke dost ke aane se pehle uske computer ko band kar diya
 She requested to change the room complaining about Ravi's snooping
 ek din baad usne favsabook par post kiya, ''maaf karnaa, jeedblyoo (jorge washington) pul se kudane ja rahaa hum
 "that day she really made the jump
" media kii shuruaati reporton main daawa kiya gaya tha ki ravi or vei ne climanti ke yon kriyakalapon ko live strimming ke jariye internet par ''broadcast'' kiya tha
 Clementi was very "sad" by this broadcast and committed suicide
 tab se yah kaha ja rahaa he ki koi broadcast yaa live strimming nahin hui thi or ki climanti ratgers main daakhila lene se pehle is mitra mandali se baahar tha
 The allegations against Ravi do not link him to Clementi's suicide
 lekin duraagrahpurn dhaunsabaji kaa arth yah he ki us par nafrat ke kaaran kiye jane vaale aparaadh yaa yon kriyalap ke kaaran climanti ko nishaanaa banane kaa aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, if Ravi is found guilty, he can be imprisoned for up to 10 years
 ravi ko saudebaaji kii peshkash kii gai thi jisase vah jail jane se batch saktaa tha
 But she refused to accept the offer and decided to contest the case
 ravi ke vakil steven di
 Altman clarified, "if Ravi had tried Saudabadi, he would certainly have a criminal record
" usne jo aparaadh kiya hi nahin, uske liye apane ko doshi kyon maanata
 He never thought of discrimination against his roommate nor did anything
 ''ravi ab bhi bhartiya naagarik he
 Therefore, if he had a criminal record, he would have been sent home
 mukademe main kai jokhim hai
 For example, if proven guilty, he will be sentenced to several years in prison and then sent home
 altman ne kaha, ''mere vichaar se, ravi ko swadesh nahin bheja jayega lekin main is bare main pakke taur par kuch nahin kah saktaa
 In America, if a person believes that he has committed a crime, he can be sent home
 '' is ghatana ke saarvajanik hone ke baad se ravi ko ghar main najarband kar diya gaya he
 "ravi was extremely sociable before this incident
" uske kai dost the
 He always consulted with them
 18 saal ke ladke ne aakhir aisa kya kiya ki vah najarband he
 "it was a major turning point in this teen's life
" tamilnadu ke pravasi mata-pita ke bete ravi ne 2010 main new jersey ke ek nami-giraami skool se shiksha hasil kii
 He was a brilliant student and brought the maximum score possible
 use computer main maharath hasil thi
 In Rutgers, when Ravi was given a roommate, he tried to find out about him
 climanti pratibhashali vaayalinavadak tha
 When Ravi did an online search, he found a gay porn website
 vahaan use pataa chalaa ki climanti samalangik he
 No good images emerged from Ravi's chat and text messages
 baharhaal, yah byora ab saarvajanik record kaa hissaa he
 In addition, revelations in a recently published article in the New Yorker magazine have also been included in the public record
 ravi jab yah paata he ki uskaa bhavi rummet samalangik he to vah pratikriya vyakt karata he (pha*** maai life / hi ij a ge), 'pur' (dude ai het pur pipul), or kathith rup se chidh jaataa he (ai vaaj pha*** hoping for samavan vid a jimail, bat no)
 But in other messages he also says that he has no problem with the roommate being gay
 adaalat main altman ne daleel di ki ravi or climanti ke post kiye gaye kai sandeshon se yah pataa chalata he ki ravi homophobic (samalangikon ke prati duraagrahagrasit) nahin tha
 But this was not disclosed to the Grand Jury who accused Ravi
 altman ke mutabik, mukademe se yah sabit ho jayega ki unke muvakkil kaa samalangikon ke prati koi duraagrah nahin he
 "I think, when members of the jury find that nothing has ever happened because of any discrimination or misconduct, they can change their mind
" jo kuch hua vah murkh, nadaan, 18 varshiya college chaatro kii khud apni nasamajhi kaa nateeja tha
 "the Indian American community has also come into the limelight with this much-discussed issue
" zyaadaatar log is par tippanee karne se batch rahe hai
 a former resident advisor in Clementi and Ravi's dormitory, Rahi Singh Grover, said on the phone that he did not want to say anything in the matter
 gauratlab he ki clement ne grover se ravi ke bare main shikaayat kii thi
 Most students familiar with Ravi or Wei in Rutgers also did not respond to emails in which their comments were sought
 yahaan tak ki south asian lesbian and ge association of neuyork city, (salga-envyeesi) sareekha mukhar samooh bhi apane ko do paaton ke bich paa rahaa he
 The group's support chair Anisa Sen said that the death of Clement has shocked us, but the noise about the matter is wrong
 unhone kaha, ''pehle hamane sochaa ki yah bada maamla he
 Ravi is South Asian and looked at it in this context
 media ne haal main yuva samalangikon kii aatmahatya ke anya maamalon main aropiyon par dhyaan nahin diya, keval peedit paksh ko focus main rakhaa
 It seems that Ravi is being made a scapegoat
 ''yah mukadmaa saal ke sabase charchit mukademon main shumaar ho saktaa he
 Gay rights groups in the US are politically influential and are under pressure in this matter
 lekin kai vidhi visheshgy, jinamein se kuch khud samalangik hai, sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki kya ravi par lagaae gaye aarope bahut sangeen or raajnneeti se prerit hai or kya ek 19 varshiya ladke ko 10 saal ke liye jail main bhejnaa uchit hoga
 Even if Ravi is acquitted, his life will change forever
 usase kaha gaya tha vah ratgers chhod de, nahin to use nishkasit kar diya jayega
 So he left Rutgers
 lekin online duniya yah bhi sunishchit karegi ki uskaa jivan un logon ke liye hameshaa ek khuli kitaab hi rahe jo uske bare main jaananaa chaahate hai

 usko lekar kejariwal ke vakil unase koi sawaal nahin poochhate hai

 The Iraq administration has banned visiting Saddam Hussein's tomb in Salahuddin province
 iraqi mantrimandal ne ravivaar ko salahuddin praant ke prashasan se saddaam kii kabr tak logon ko jane se rokane ke liye sabhi aavashyak upaay karne ko kaha
 According to sources, the provincial administration deployed police personnel around the building where Saddam's tomb was located on Sunday morning to prevent people from reaching Saddam's tomb
 iraq sarkaar ne varsh 2009 main saddaam kii kabr par logon ke sangathit daure tathaa schuli chaatro ke jane ko pratibandhit kar diya tha
 This was done in the wake of concerns over support for Saddam and his banned Baath Party
 iraq par varsh 2009 main america akraman ke baad saddaam hossain ko satta se bedakhal kar diya gaya tha
 In 2006, the US was hanged after Saddam was convicted of a crime against humanity

 The Uttar Pradesh government has prohibited illegal loudspeakers from being played in religious and public places
 sarkaar ne iske liye sabhi ko hidaayat di he ki bagaiyr anumati ke baj rahe saare avaidh laudspikar 20 janvari tak hataa liye jaaen
 This decision has been taken after the order of the Allahabad High Court, prohibiting the playing of loudspeakers without permission in religious places, public places, processions and water bodies
 20 disambar 2017 koelahabaad hoicourt neyupi sarkaar se sawaal kiya tha ki kiske aadesh par laudspikar baj rahe hai? hoicourt kii lakhanu bench ne mandir or masjid main laudspikar bajaane ko lekar daayar kii gai janhit yachika par uttar pradesh ke grih sachiv, mukhya sachiv or rashtriya harith praadhikaran (engiti) ke pramukh ko talab kiya tha
 At that time, the court said that before playing loudspeakers on any special occasion, permission has to be obtained from the administration and permission to play loudspeakers will be given only with the conditions fixed
 dhwani pradooshan (viniman or niyantran) niyam, 2000 ke mutabik raat 10 baje se subah 6 baje tak laudspikar bajaane kii ijaajat nahin he
 Then why is the UP government not following it? Currently, the Uttar Pradesh government has banned loudspeakers playing in religious and public places
 pramukh sachiv (grih) arvind kumaar ne nirdesh diya he ki laudspikar kaa istemaal karne vaale 15 janvari tak nae pranjtp ke mutabik anumati hasil kar len
 If not, all loudspeakers should be removed by January 20
 is sambandh main pramukh sachiv grih ko 1 farvari ko hai court ko report bhi deni he
 What does the law say? The 5th section of the Noise Pollution (act and Control) Act, 2000 which comes under the Environment (protection) Act, 1986, curbs the sound of loudspeakers and instruments playing in public places in an arbitrary manner
 1
 Permission in writing must be obtained from the administration to play loudspeakers or instruments in public places
 2
 Loudspeakers or devices in public places cannot be played at night
 ise raat 10 baje se lekar subah 6 baje tak bajaane par roak he
 However it can be played in closed rooms or halls such as auditorium, conference room, community and bankt hall
 3
 As per sub-section (2) of the rule, the State Government may make concessions in this regard under certain special circumstances
 vah kisi sanghathan yaa dharmik kaarykram ke dauraan laudspikar yaa saarvajanik sthalon par chalane vaale yantron ko bajaane kii anumati raat 10 baje se badhaakar 12 baje tak de sakati he
 However, under no circumstances can such permission be granted more than 15 days in a year
 rajya sarkaar ke paas yah adhikaar hota he ki vah kshetra ke hisaab se kisi ko bhi audyogic, vyavsaayik, awasaiya yaa shant kshetra ghoshit kar saktaa he
 Such programs cannot be conducted within the 100 meter radius of hospitals, educational organizations and courts, as the government can declare these areas as quiet zone zones
 kin kshetron main kya he dhwani seemaaise niyam ke anusaar, saarvajanik or nijee sthalon paralaudespikar kii dhvanisima kramash:10 desibal or paanch desibal se adhik nahin hogi
 In residential areas, the sound level can be kept at 55 decibels from 6 am to 10 pm, and only up to 45 decibels from 10 am to 6 am
 jabaki vyavsaayik kshetra main subah 6 baje se raat 10 baje tak 65 desibal or raat 10 baje se subah 6 baje tak 55 desibal tak kaa str hona chahie
 On the other hand, in industrial areas during this period, the sound level can be kept at 75 decibels from 6 am to 10 pm
 vahiin shant kshetra (silence jone) main in dauraan kramshah 50 desibal or 40 desibal dhwani kaa str rakhaa janaa chahie
 It is considered a punishable offense under Section 15 of the Environment (protection) 1986 Act
 niyam kaa ulanghan karne par 5 saal kii jail yaa ek lakh kaa jurmaana yaa phir donon (jail or jurmaana) sajaa di ja sakati he
 Also, there is a separate provision for punishment of five thousand rupees per day for violation of every day

 ' After the case of Chhattisgarh Public Service Commission Examination - 2008 was hanged in the court, Guduram focused all the attention on the Commission's 2011 examination
 sapana tha chhattisgarh rajya seva main ucch pad hasil karne kaa
 To give parents rest from the hard work of the day and to send sisters to school
 iske liye guddu ne din-raat ek kiya or dipti colector kaa pad hasil kiya
 Today it is discussed in every house of the state
 guddu ke parivaar kii aarthik sthiti itani kamjor thi ki unke mata-pita ko mazdooree karne ke liye duusare rajyon main janaa padataa tha
 Here, they used to work in other fields, so that they could not live
 anya pradesh main unhen kuch zyada mazdooree mil jaaya karti thi
 When Guddu was young, he would also accompany his parents and help them in brick-making, working in the fields
 haalanki usne yah kaam peshewar rup se kabhi nahin kiya
 Seeing Guddu's desire to read, Mama Baburam took him with him to village Manikchauri
 yahaan sarkari skool se usne praathmik va madhyamik str kii shiksha kii
 Then moved to Masturi Block for high school and college studies
 padhai ke dauraan usne rajya lok seva ayog kaa vigyaapan dekha
 Mama prompted to fill the examination form and take the examination
 guddu ne pehali baar vigyaapan main piessi shabd suna tha
 He started preparing and after passing the preliminary examination he appeared in the main examination

 a few months ago the High Court's decision came and the results came out
 uskaa lekhadhikari pad par chayan ho gaya or guddu dipti colector ban gaya

 maa sukhbai or pita bhagwat prasad jagat ko jaankaree di
 He could not believe the son becoming deputy collector
 maa-pita to sahi se hindi bhi nahin bol pate hai
 They say in Chhattisgarhi, 'mor son, make every effort hard, Sir
 rathiya bhar padhat rahis
 'he was sure that the son would do something, but he did not even think of it as a deputy collector
 paanch bahanon ke iklaute bhai guddu kaa kahana he ki sabase badi takat padhai kii hoti he
 Due to very bad financial condition, none of her sisters could get a chance to study
 dipti colector guddu ab sabhi bahanon ko skool bhejenge or unki behatar dhang se shaadi karenge
 They have also thought of encouraging the people around them to send children to school

 The matter will be heard on Thursday in the CJM court
 bihar ke swasthya mantri, swasthya sachiv sahit anya par mujffarpur court main pariwaad patr bijepi netaa chandrakishor ne daayar kiya he
 On the other hand, Commissioner of Muzaffarpur Atul Prasad has sought a report from Vikas Kumar, Principal of Sri Krishna Medical College, on this entire matter
 shrikrishna medical college ke praachaarya vikaas kumaar nenrkankal ke taskrimaamle kii jaanch kii jimmedaari apane hi college ke epaimati or anatomi ke vibhaagadhyaksh ko saunpi he
 a sensational case of trafficking of narcotics came to light in this medical college
 is khulaasa ke baad medical college main hadakamp much gaya tha
 In the collusion with the sanitation workers and other personnel of the medical college, this crime was going on
 ek lambe arase se is college main is gorakhdhandhe ko bade hi suniyojit dhang se anjaam diya ja rahaa tha
 Until recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was prominently talking about 'one country one election', but it was put on the back burner due to it being impossible to implement in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki 'modi magic' ko dekhte hue bijepi shasit 3 rajya samay purv vidhansabha bhang kar isi aam chunaav ke saath vidhansabha chunaav main utar sakate hai, ab aisa hone nahin ho ja rahaa he jo yah dikhaata he ki kahin na kahin loksabhaa chunaav main jeet ko lekar party aashwast nahin he
 In the meeting held on Friday, the cabinet of Maharashtra and Haryana did not take any decision on dissolving their assembly and holding elections in the state along with the Lok Sabha elections
 lambey samay se aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki loksabhaa chunaav ke saath maharashtra or haryana samet jharkhand main vidhansabha chunaav karaae ja sakate hai, jis par ab viraam sa lag gaya he
 Despite taking a big step like Airstrike in Balakot after the Pulwama terror attack, the BJP is in a mood to not hold the assembly elections in these states prematurely due to not being confident of returning to power at the Center
 haalanki bijepi ke sheersh str ke netaa lambey samay se bijepi shasit in 3 rajyon main loksabhaa ke saath chunaav karaane kii baat karte rahe hai kyonki yahaan par aam chunaav ke kuch maheene baad hi vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Apart from Maharashtra and Haryana, Jharkhand is bjp-ruled, where it was believed that the BJP could contest the Lok Sabha as well as the Lok Sabha by dissolving the assembly
 maharashtra or haryana main is saal november main vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal puraa ho rahaa he, jabaki jharkhand main agle saal janvari main puraa hoga
 The reasoning behind the premature elections was that the BJP could take advantage of the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, leaving behind the anti-incumbency in these states and win again
 khaskar jharkhand main jahaan vartmaan sarkaar ke khilaaf khaasaa rosh he
 The central government was beset with many challenges, although there is one thing that after the Balakot strike, some power was seen in the BJP ruled states, but now the opposition parties as well as the widows of many martyrs in Pulwama also asked for evidence of the Balakot strike
 Going has made matters complicated
 kuch antarrashtriya media ne bhi bharat kii ore se jaish-e-mohammad ke thikanon ko tabah kiye jane or pakistan ke epa-16 fiter vimaan ko giraae jane ke daawey par sawaal kiye hai
 At the same time, questions are also being raised about the death of 250 to 400 terrorists in the Balakot strike
 sirf balakot strike hi nahin, isse pehle rafel deal vivaad, badhati berogari, aatankwaad or kisaanon kii khastahal sthiti samet aise dheron mudde hai jisase centre sarkaar ghiri hui he
 In such a situation, this was the right option for the BJP government of Maharashtra and Haryana to complete their tenure
 2004 ke udhaaharan se sabak2004 main atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar samay se 6 maheene pehle loksabhaa bhang karakar chunaav maidan main utari thi
 Then it seemed that there was a wave in favor of Vajpayee government in the country and the biggest reason behind this was that in the end of 2003, in December 3 out of 4 states of Hindi belt, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh won big He can get the benefit in the Lok Sabha elections if he is made soon
 lekin jab aam chunaav karaae gaye to rigelt chaunkaane vaale aae or vaajapeyi sarkaar ko shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 However, these 3 states still support a lot of 'modi magic', because these states feel that if the Modi government loses in the general election, then their government may have to face defeat, and if Narendra Modi at the center If Modi manages to become Prime Minister again, the results of the Lok Sabha elections in these states will be affected and BJP can again win the election in the name of 'modi Magic'
 aise main jeet hi ekmaatr sahaara he

 There are few days left to present the budget for the financial year 2016-17
 aise main aam janata ke alaava bharat kii jidipi main yogadan dene vaale kai sectors ko bajet se kaaphi ummiden hai
 One of these sectors is the tourism industry
 aisi ummid he ki pichley kuch varshon kii tarah is saal kaa bajet bhi tourism industry ko badhaava dene vaala hoga
 Whether it is to increase revenue or to give jobs, the travel and tourism sector strengthens India's economy in both ways
 vahiin, bharat kii jidipi main bhi iskaa ek bada yogadan he
 To promote this sector, there is a need to provide good allocation in the coming budget so that India's status in the world tourism map can be strengthened
 zyada se zyada tourist bharat main aaen, iske liye jaruri he ki sarkaar bajet main kuch vishesh chizon ko or zyada prabhavi tareeke se shaamil kare
 Let us know, there is a need to pay attention to the things in this sector: 1) Tourist security needs to spend more money in the budget for the safety of the travelers
 jis tarah pichley kuch maheenon main hamale hue hai, or krime kaa level badha he, usase yatriyon ke man main suraksha ke prati shankaaen bad rahi hai
 Many times tourists come to see the beauty of India and their belongings are stolen or some such criminal incident happens because of which they do not want to come back again
 isliye is suraksha par vishesh kharch karne kii jarurat he
 2) To promote infrastructureurism, the most important is to strengthen the country's infrastructure
 iske liye jaruri he rail connactivity, sadaken orhotel aadi kii behtareen vyavastha hona
 There is a need to increase facilities in places where the traveler likes to go the most
 iske alaava parking ar divyang logon ke liye vishesh vyavastha par bhi kharch karnaa jaruri he
 3) Increasing tax exemption scope is a big issue
 sarkaar ko chahie ki adventure tourism, medical tourism or online travel ke liye tex chhot kaa dayera badaye
 Tax exemption is one such provision that the tourism industry is waiting for
 4) majboot marketing stritjibharat un deshon main se ek he jahaan ki vividhta or sundarataa ko dekhne ke liye dur-dur se log aate hai
 It proves to be a better tourist spot in all cases
 aise main vaishvik str par bharat ko ek market brond banane ke liye majboot marketing kii shuruyaat karne kii jarurat he
 5) Promote digital payment Apart from this, the government should initiate tax rebate for those who make digital payments
 saath hi online pment ko or protsaahit karne ke liepramotion ke nae tareeke talashne kii jarurat he
 6) Need to make tourist friendly India needs to make India tourist choice and make India business and traveler friendly
 lihaaja medical tourism ke liye bajet main ek hissaa rakhana vardaan sabit ho saktaa he
 7) Tax exemption to traders
 There is a need to give tax rebate to traders who have made online transactions mandatory for large amount transactions
 isse kaale dhan kii bhi samasya par lagaam lagane main bhi madad milegi

 All eyes are on the BMC results, where for the first time in two decades, BJP Shivshena is contesting separate elections
 isliye kaha ja rahaa he ki shivasena-bijepi donon kii saakh daanv par he
 Looking at the way the two parties have been attacking each other in recent times, it seems that the results of the local body elections may also have an impact on the common government operating in the state
 vaise main aaj ke nattejey donon hi partiyon ke liye kaafii myne rakhte hai
 There was a record 56% turnout this time for the body elections

 Yogi Adityanath has said in his latest statement that no one is safe in Muslim dominated areas
 saath hi unhone kaha ki dange vahiin hote hai, jahaan muslimon kii aabaadi zyada hoti he
 He said that if we analyze the riots in the country, then it comes to light that where Muslims constitute 10-20 percent of the population, there is more communal tension
 yogi adityanath ne kaha ki jahaan muslimon kii aabaadi 40 fisadi se zyada hoti he, vahaan gaiyr-muslimon ke liye koi jagah nahin hoti he, gaiyr-muslimon ko yaa to vahaan se visthapit hone ke liye dabaav daalaa jaataa he yaa phir unhen vahaan se khaded diya jaataa he
 Adityanath said, we have to accept the truth
 mujhe lagata he ki agar ham sachai ko kabool nahin karte hai, to yah hamaare desh ke logon ke saath ninsaphi he
 Wherever Hindus reside in such areas in India, their reputation is in danger
 yogi ne kaha, yadi upi main kendriya ardhsainik balon kii nigaraanee main vidhansabha upachunaav karaae jate hai to bhaajapa sabhi siton par jeet darj karegi
 The leaders of various parties have reacted strongly to Yogi's statement
 congress pravaktaa raashid alvi ne kaha ki yogi adityanath aise bayaan dete rahete hai, jinase sampradayik maahaul kharaab ho
 
 
 Is it permissible to fight Hindus and Muslims within the country for the sake of a few seats
 haalanki bijepi ne yogi adityanath ke bayaan se khud ko kinaaraa karne kii koshish kii he
 BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that such a statement should not be given, as the BJP believes in the matter of 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
 haal hi main bhaajapa alaakaman ne yogi ko upi upachunaav kaa prabharee banaaya he
 Shah Rukh Khan is constantly facing opposition, making statements on growing intolerance in India

 Also, people threw stones at his car parked in the parking lot
 jaanch main juty pulicemauke par pahunchi policejaanchamen jute gai he
 Also, CCTV footage of the hotel is also being investigated
 shahrukhki film 'rais' ki shooting ahmedabad ke jamalpur ilaake main honi he
 It was said that Shah Rukh has increased a little intolerance in the country
 samaaj hi nahin duniya ke noujvaan jaldi riect karte hai
 The medium has become as many voices
 lekin awaajen hi nahin nakaaratmak awaajen zyada ho gai hai
 We have to maintain the belief that all religions are equal
 baad main jataayaa khexishnutaa par die gaye apane bayaan par baad main shahrukh khan ne maafee maangi
 He said that his words were misinterpreted
 vah dukhi he ki vah apni baat logon ko sahi se nahin samajha paae
 If anyone has been hurt by what he said about intolerance, he asks for a demand
 shahrukh ne kaha, 'mujhe har dharm ke logon kaa pyaar mila he
 i went to any country in the world, people unconditionally gave me lots of love
 bahut sari baaten main jo bolta hum uskaa galat matlab nikaala jaataa he
 i am sad that i have not been able to properly explain my point on intolerance

 Many BJP leaders who are angry in Haryana are expected to get red lights soon
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh subhash baraala or prabharee anil jain ne sirsa main is baat ke sanket die
 Even after the formation of the BJP government in Haryana, almost three dozen boards and corporations were not appointed to the posts of president and vice-president
 bijepi kii sarkaar main jin netaaon ko jagah nahin mili thi ve sabhi party alaakaman se naaraazgi jaahir kar chuke the
 But soon after the indications of BJP state president and in-charge, the leaders of Haryana BJP have started lobbying to get the red light
 party netaa apane bade netaaon or mukhyamantri se sampark saadhane kii koshish main jute gaye hai
 Since the time of the last Congress government, the posts of Chairman of Gau Seva Commission, Child Development Commission, State Food Security Commission, Backward Classes Commission and Scheduled Caste Welfare Commission have been lying vacant in the state
 saath hi jin nigamon or board main prashaasak niyukt hai vahaan bhi adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh kii niyukti kii jaani he
 The Haryana BJP high command will try to accommodate most of the angry legislators
 sanghathan ke kuch prabhaavshaalee netaaon ko bhi lalabatti milane kii ummid he
 a mahant from Amethi, Rahul Gandhi's parliamentary constituency, cut off his genitals fearing accusations against Asaram Bapu and the actions being taken against him
 mahant ko gambhir haalat main aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 The fear of this Baba is that the way accusations have been made on Asaram, no one should accuse him of such charges on tomorrow
 jila amethi ke madhavpur ke udasin math ke mahant swami premadas kaa is vakt aspataal main ilaaj chal rahaa he
 Baba has no other disease, instead he cut his genitals with his hand with a blade
 baad ashram ke logon ne baba ko gambhir haalat main aspataal pahunchaa
 The doctor treating him said, 'babaji had come to Gauriganj
 unhone apana pennish half cat kar liya he
 In view, the entire penis has been cut from near half
 philhal bleeding ko sicyor kar diya gaya he
 Now the condition is out of danger 'asaram went to jail, then scared Mahanta Asaram is in jail at this time
 unki kerani kaa pardaafash ho gaya he
 In such a situation, anyone who sees himself attached to such works is right to be scared
 yahi kaaran he ki baba premadas ne asaram jaise bade mahant kaa hashr dekhakar apana guptang kaat daalaa, jisase kabhi bhavishya main un par koi is tarah kaa aarope na laga sake
 Baba Mahant Premdas, who cut his genitals, said, 'now you see what is happening in the society
 maine bas yahi sochaa ki isko kaat denge, to asaram baapu kaa jo haal he, vaise kabhi hamaare upar koi ungali nahin uthaa sakegaa
 Today's era is such that no one's mouth can be closed, the world is very big
 'kathith sadhu-mahatmaon kii vajah se ab dharm bhi sharminda hone laga he
 In this way, cutting the genitals of a Baba is also under question
 padhegaa india tabhi to badhegaa india
 This slogan is loudly given to promote school education in the country
 khaas taur par gaanvon main bacchon ko skool bhejne par jor diya jaataa he
 But you will be surprised to know the ground reality of a government school in Haryana

 There is talk of a government high school in Sillakhedi village of Jind
 haryana schuli shiksha board se jude is skool se is baar 20 bacchon ne dasvin kaa imtihaan diya jinamein se ek bhi paas nahin hua
 Now, also tell us about the school's results for 2014-15, 2015-16
 pichley saal yani 2015-16 main skool main dasvin main 15 bachche the, 15 ke 15 pariksha main ludhak gaye
 At the same time, in 2014-15, 22 children from school took the class x examination, not a single one got success
 nateeja ye rahaa ki skool nedesavin main sabhi bacchon ke fail hone kii hetricbana lee he
 Aaj Tak tried to get to the bottom of this bad result
 bacchon se baat kii gai to wo skool ke shikshakon ke thik se nahin padhaane ko jimmedaar tehraate dikhe
 At the same time, the school teachers cried out the lack of staff for the poor results
 kuch bacchon ne bhi staff puraa nahin hone kii baat kahi
 According to the school's chief executive teacher Pradeep Singh, the result of class 10 was so bad due to the vacant posts of science and Hindi teacher
 pradeep singh ke mutabik kul 7 pad khaali pade hai
 According to the village sarpanch Anguri Devi, it is a shame for all the children to fail
 sarpanch ne bataaya ki skool main shikshakon ke jo pad khaali hai, unhen sheeghra bharne ke liye shashan ko chitthee bhejengi
 Vindana Gupta, District Education Officer, Jind, has taken a serious stand on the school's poor results
 unhone jahaan block officer se is sambandh main baat kii he, vahiin ye bhi kaha he ki wo khud maukey par jaakar kaarnon kaa pataa lagaayengi
 He said that action will be taken against whoever is responsible for the bad result
 saath hi aise kadam uthaae jaaenge ki phir aisa kharaab rigelt nahin aae
 The district education officer also did not rule out the possibility of factionalism of teachers behind the poor results
