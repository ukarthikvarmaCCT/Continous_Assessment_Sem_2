 ' Welcome Home Abhinandan: bharat or pakistan ke bich jari tanaav ke bich kareeb 60 ghante paak kii sarajameen par samay bitaakar bhartiya vayusena (IAF Pilot) ke wing commander abhinandan vardhaman (abhinandan Varthaman) surakshit vatan laute aae hai
 On Friday, after a day's waiting and a struggle of Pakistan's tactics, Abhanandan, an Air Force pilot, finally returned to Indian soil from Pakistan at around 9
16 am
 unki vaapasi se pehle ke kuch ghante sanshay se bhare rahe
 There was no time for why Pakistan is so late in bringing back the commander Abhinandan (abhinandan Varthaman)
 baar-baar samay main badlaav kii vajah se kai baar phir se pakistan ke mansoobon par bharatiyon ko shaq hua
 Wing Commander Abhinandan appeared at the Wagah checkpost towards Pakistan at 9
10 pm and was accompanied by the Indian Air Attache at the High Commission in the Pakistani Ranger, Islamabad
 ve gahare rang kaa kot or khaaki rang kii pant pahane hue the
 Proudly raised head Wing Commander Abhinandan crossed the gate from Pakistan and entered India
 abhinandan kii vaapasi ne desh main jashn kaa maahaul bana diya or sabhi abhinandan kii vaapasi par ek sur main bole- vatan vaapasi par abhinandan kaa hardik abhinandan
 So let's know what happened on Friday during the return process of Abhinandan
 
 
 27 farvari ko pakistani vimaanon dwaara bhartiya vaayu seemaa ke ulanghan ke dauraan adamya veerta kaa pradarshan karne vaale wing commander abhinandan shuukravaar raat ko pakistan se swadesh waapas laut aae
 The hours before his return were full of doubt
 is kadam ko aatankwaad kaa pakistan se jari samarthan par bharat ke jawaab ke baad utpann tanaav kii sthiti ko kam karne kii disha main ek mahatvapurn kadam ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Indeed, on Friday Pakistan was about to hand over the wing commander Abhinandan to India
 iske liye bharat kii ore se puri taiyaariyaan kii ja chuki thim
 Air force officials, Indian embassy officials and government representatives were ready at all times, but Pakistan's tactics were carried out from noon to night
 pehle pakistan kii ore se hi bataaya gaya tha ki abhinandan ko vah kareeb dopaher main 3 se chaar baje ke bich main reeha kar degaa, magar usne baar-baar deree kii
 There are many reasons behind this
 masalan, vah is ghatana ko lim lite main laana chahta tha
 He wanted the whole world to see this news
 kareeb shaam ke teen baje ke aas-paas abhinandan ko pakistan ne rawalpindi se lahore pahunchaa diya
 But he took so long to bring the Wagah border from Lahore, due to which his evil intentions were also revealed in front of him
 sutron kii maane to abhinandan ko lahore main sthit kisi sena ke chhavnee main roak kar rakhaa gaya tha or pakistan neabhinandan kaa jabarnek video banaaya
 It is also true that the process of documentation between Pakistan and India was delayed for some time, but this delay was not so much that the return of Abhinandan should take place from noon to night
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar bhartiya payalat abhinandan ko bharat ko saunpe jane main deree isliye hui kyonki, unase pakistani adhikariyon ne camere par bayaan darj karne ko kaha
 Only after this he was allowed to cross the border and go home
 iske alaava dastavejon se sambandhit mudde bhi deree kii vajah bani
 Sources said that Pakistan postponed his release twice
 amritsar ke upayukta shiv dulaar singh dhillon ne bataaya ki bahadur payalat apane desh lautakar khush he
 Asked what Abhinandan told the officers when he returned home, the Deputy Commissioner said that he first smiled and said, 'I am happy to return to my country
 'wagha ataari seemaa par kuch aupchaariktaaon ke baad unhen biguef adhikariyon ko saunp diya gaya
 Later Air Force officers brought the greetings with them
 iske baad wing commander ko ataari seemaa se vayusena ke vaahan main amritsar le jaaya gaya
 During this time, the police of Punjab Police were driving with their vehicle
 iske baad vardhaman ko hawaii maarg se dilli laayaa gaya
 He was then taken to the Army Hospital, where he would be physically examined
 wing commander abhinandan 27 farvari ko subah kareeb das baje pakistani vayusena ke fiter plane kaa peechha karte hue pakistan kii seemaa main ja ghuse
 Abhinandan's plane also crashed after Pakistan killed the F-16
 is vajah se unhen kisi tarah parachute kii madad se utarana padaa
 When he came down, he did not realize that he had reached the land of enemy country
 kuch log unke paas aae, jinase abhinandan ne poocha ki vah kahaan hai
 On this, some Pakistanis showed tact and told them that you are on the Indian side
 magar abhinandan ko kuch shaq hua
 After this he shouted slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai
 iske baad phir pakistaniyon ne unhen gher liya
 Abhinandan somehow ran away to save himself
 baad main unhen pakistani sena ne apni hiraasat main le liya
 The army questioned him, but Abhinandan opened his mouth as much as he was allowed to tell in the Air Force
 iske baad unhen pakistani sena ne chaay-coffee bhi pilaai
 Then after the announcement of Imran Khan, the world came to know that he will return to his homeland after just two days
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne abhinandan kii vaapasi kaa swaagat karte hue twit main kaha, ‘wing commander abhinandan aapkaa ghar main swaagat he
 The nation is proud of your indomitable courage
 hamaare sashastr bal desh ke 130 karod bharatiyon ke liye prerana kaa strot hai
 On the return of Wing Commander Abhinandan, the eyes of the entire country were seen all day on the Wagah border
 itnaa hi nahin, wing commander abhinandan ko rahul gandhi, samet kai raajnneetik netaaon ne badhai di or unki vatan vaapasi par twit kiye
 As Air Force officer Abhinandan Vardhaman returned from Pakistan's custody, a large number of media persons were eyeing it and people from all over the country stared at the TV set
 ataari bagha seemaa ke paas checkpost par subah se hi log tirangaa liye jamaa the
 Many of them had their faces painted with a tricolor and were also shouting slogans in support of the safe return of Wing Commander Abhinandan and there was an atmosphere of celebration
 gauratlab he ki bhartiya vaayu sena ne pakistani seemaa main jaish e mohammad ke thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Thereafter, the Indian Air Force was violated by the Pakistani Air Force and during the air conflict during this time Pakistan's F
 
 16 aircraft were dropped and India's mig 21 crashed
 is sangharsh ke parinamswaroop wing commander abhinandan kaa parachute seemaa par bad gaya or unhen 27 farvari ko pakistan ne pakad liya gaya tha
 Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said in his Parliament that he is releasing the Indian pilot as a message of peace
 unhone is kadam ko shanti jescher bataaya tha
 Wing Commander Abhinandan appeared at the Wagah checkpost towards Pakistan at 9
10 pm and was accompanied by the Indian Air Attache at the High Commission in the Pakistani Ranger, Islamabad

 Proudly raised head Wing Commander Abhinandan prisoner crossed the gate from Pakistan and returned home to India
 airvis marshall aar ji ke kapur ne kaha ki vayusena ke payalat abhinandan ko abhi abhi hamen saunpa gaya he
 He said that we are happy to have him back
 unhone kaha ki payalat ko vistrut chikitsa pareekshan ke liye le jaaya jaayegaa kyonki unhen kaaphi tanaav ke kshanon se guzarana padaa
 The Foreign Ministry said that Wing Commander Abhinandan was handed over to the Indian authorities at the Wagah attic border
 darasal, 26 farvari ko pulavama aatanki hamale kaa badla lene ke liye bharat ne pakistani sarajameen par pal rahe jaish ke aatanki thikaanon par hamalaa bolaa
 The Indian Air Force had on Tuesday morning dropped bombs on jaish-e-mohammed's terrorist camp in Balakot, Pakistan and killed about 300 terrorists
 is dauraan bharat ne kareeb 12 miraj ladaaku vimaanon kaa istemaal kiya or 1000 kilo bamon kii barish kar di
 After this Pakistan's anger started coming out and it tried to reject the claim of India
 aatanki thikaanon par bharat kii airstrike ke baad se donon deshon ke bich tanaav or bad gaya
 However, after Airstrike, India informed this to all countries

 supreme court main ab ayodhya maamle kaa aglaa adhyay shurgayodhya cese main 9 disambar tak daakhil ho sakengi pitishanpith ke sadsy jaj tay karenge ki phir sunwaayee ho yaa nahinsupreme court main ayodhya maamle kaa aglaa adhyay shuru ho gaya he
 Now the round of review i
e
 review petition has started
 pehali yachika jamiyat ulema-e-hind kii ore se aa gai he
 Arguments have to come from the petitioners fighting the case on behalf of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board
 yachikaayen 9 disambar tak daakhil karne kii miyaad he
 Because reconsideration petitions can be filed within 30 days of the decision coming
 punarvichaar yachika kii prakriyaab yachikaayen daakhil karne ke baad kii prakriya par baat kar len? kanoonee prakriya ke mutabik jo peeth mulayachikaaki sunwaayee karti he vahi punarvichaar yachika par bhi vichaar karti he
 Because the judges of the same bench are aware of every turn of the trial, every argument and plea
 ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayee karne vaali paanch jajon kii peeth main se ek jaj yani justise ranjan gogoi ritair ho chuke hai
 But Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde, who was part of this bench, is now the Chief Justice
 lihaaja, unka visheshadhikaar he ki wo bench main ek aurajajko shaamil karen taaki korum puraa ho sake
 The legal process comes into its own speed after the number of judges of the bench is complete five
 yani iske baad kaayda ye he ki sabhi punarvichaar yachikaayen peeth ke paanchon jajon ko banti jaati hai
 Everyone studies them
 iske baad unki chember main meeting hoti he
 The merits of petitions or petitions are discussed in the meeting
 agar peeth ke sabhi sadsy jajon ko lagata he ki haa, faisle ko lekar jo sawaal yachika main uthaae gaye hai jin par phir se vichaar karne kii jarurat he to tabhi maamle kii sunwaayee khuliadalatamen hoti he
 Otherwise, the petition dies in the chamber hearing
 baahar to sirf khabar aati he--no merit found
 
 rivyuu pitishan dismisd
 If you look at the history and record of the results of the review petition in the history and record supreme court, 99
 99% rivyuu yachikaayen chember main hi dam tod detii hai
 They do not have a hearing in open court
 ab is maamle main kya kya ho saktaa he? chember main sunwaayee main bhi ye dismis ho sakati he
 Due to big case like Rafael and Sabarimala, it can also be heard in open court
 kya ho sakati he gunjishcember hearing ke dauraan is yachika ke dam tod dene ke peeche tark ye he ki bench ke paanchon jajon ne ek raay se faisla diya tha
 So there is little scope for change or rebound
 agar teen-do yaa chaar-ek ke anupaat main faisla aayaa hota to shaayad khuli adaalat main isaki sunwaayee kii gunjaaish zyada ho jaati
 The reasoning behind its hearing in open court is that since the matter is related to history, culture, social fabric as well as politics
 lihaaja is gahare asar daalane vaale mukademe main daakhil hone vaali rivyuu yachikaaon kii sunwaayee khuli adaalat main bhi ho sakati he, taaki is faisle ko lekar bhavishya main bhi koi shaq shubha afvaah yaa galat sandesh naa failaa sake
 That is, in the order of being precedent for centuries, it should also be said in this judgment that the court provided the last chance to all
 aakhri tak miltaa he maukaab jahaan tak sanvaidhanik adhikaron kaa sawaal he to rivyuu pitishan khaarij hone ke baad curative pitishan yani upachaar yachika daakhil karne kaa vikalp bhi khulaa rahata he
 Obviously, the warriors who are standing in the field till the last moment will definitely want to use it as well
 adaalat bhi chaahegi ki sadiyon baad bhi koi is faisle auranyaaypalikapar ungali naa uthaa sake ki adaalat ne hamen tark dene kaa mauka die bina ekatarfa hi hamaari rivyuu yachika khaarij kar di
 The court also has to give the message that the judiciary does not work under any pressure or influence
 harek sthiti main wo swatantra, nishpaksh or aaazaad he
 His decisions are based on arguments and evidence, not just opinion or belief
 bharat or australia ke bich kal se khelen jane vaale dharmashala test ke liye tej gendbaaj mohammad shami or mumbai ke ballebaaj shreyas ayyar ko bhartiya team main shaamil kiya gaya he

 The process of cows dying in the Hingonia Gaushala of Jaipur is not taking the name of being stopped
 pichley paanch dinon main dhai sau gaayen is gaushala main aakar mar gai hai
 On cows dying in the cowshed, the government says that the cows being brought from outside are dying
 ye gaayen plastic khain rahati hai, lihaaja iske liye janata jimmedaar he jabaki gopalkon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kii laaparvaahee kii vajah se gaayen mar rahi he
 Meanwhile, the Congress has announced to take up the case of Hingonia Gaushala in the assembly session starting on Thursday
 hairat kii baat he ki rajasthan go tex lagane vaala pehla rajya he or rajya sarkaar ne is tex se abtak kareeb 100 karod jutaaye hai
 But the government has not spent a single penny from this fund
 pakadakar laai jaati hai aawaara gayenhingonia gaushala main pichley paanch dinon main 258 gaayen dam tod chuki hai
 According to sources, the condition of cows in Gaushala had become so bad in the last three months that doctors are not able to save the cows
 keechad daldal main bina khaae-piye lambey samay tak rahane se inhen infections ho gaya he
 Whereas the Goan rearing minister of Rajasthan government, Ottaram Dewasi, claims that Hingonia is actually Kanji House where stray cows are brought
 aise main polithine khaakar ai gaayen bahut biimaar ho jaati hai or mar jaati hai
 The minister says that there have been deaths even in the Congress Raj
 mantriji ko dukh is baat kaa bhi he ki gopaalan vibhaag ne abhi tak puri tarah se vibhaag ke rup main kaam karnaa shuru nahin kiya he kyonki vibhaag ko bajet nahin mil paaya he
 100 crore rupees from the Gopal tax is another fact contrary to the claim of Rajasthan government
 rajasthan aisa pehla rajya he jahaan gopal tex lagata he
 100 crore rupees have been received from this tax in the treasury of Rajasthan government so far, but not a single penny has been spent because the tax is handled by the Finance Department, which is headed by Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 go tex kaa upyog kaise ho, iske liye mukhya sachiv teen baithken kar chuke hai magar abtak koi faisla nahin ho paaya he
 
 
 
 isliye plastic kha rahi hai gaayengopalak sant manhat gopaldaas kaa kahana he ki sarkaar gaayon kii gochar jaminen khai ja rahi he isliye gaayen plastic kha rahi he
 The government should hand over the Gaushala saints
 is bich gaay ko lekar rajya main jabardast siyasat bhi chal rahi he
 In the assembly session starting on Thursday, the Congress has already announced a ruckus by making the issue of cow and poor
 purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kaa kahana he ki congress bijepi ke gaay or garib ko lekar dohare maapdand ko janata ke saamne ujagar karegi
 It is not easy for the Rajasthan government to respond to the deaths of cows
 vipaksh is baat ko lekar bhi mudda bana rahi he ki chaar din baad hingonia gaushala jane kaa baat kahanevaali mukhyamantri gaushala abtak nahin gayi
 On the other hand, the government has asked the officials to reduce the death toll of cows at any cost

 14 march ko pune main congress kaaryakartaaon ke saath band kamare main hui baithak main rahul ne party kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki ve adhik se adhik siten laane kii koshish karen, taaki ensipi ke saath gathjod kii jarurat kam ho jaae
 He was widely criticized and NCP leader Sharad Pawar refused to come on stage with him during an election rally in Mumbai on 20 April
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aane ke ek din baad 17 may ko bahujan samaaj party (bispi) kii netaa mayawati ne apni party ke kharaab pradarshan kaa thikra congress ke sir phoda
 He said that supporting the UPA under the leadership of the Congress proved suicidal and the party paid its price

 neshnal conference ke netaa jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne bhi congress ke saath apni party ke gathjod kaa mudda uthaaya he
 In a television interview, he said, "many leaders in Congress and National Conference want to end this alliance, at the moment i cannot say what its future will be
" ’’congress ke kuch netaa lok janashakti party (algepi) netaa ramvilas paswan ke endie main jane ke liye bhi rahul ko jimmedaar maanate hai
 Paswan met both Sonia and Rahul twice in January to talk about the alliance
 party ke ek varisht netaa ne bataaya, ‘‘aakhri kshan tak rahul tay nahin kar paae ki lalu yadav or ramvilas yaa nitish kumaar main se kiske saath gathjod kiya jaae
 "way of the future" Many big and small leaders of Congress are demanding change of party structure
 rajasthan congress adhyaksh sachin payalat kaa kahana he, ‘‘bekaar logon ko turant baahar kiya jaae
 The ground support and people connected with the public will have to be brought up
 ’’ lekin ve is sawaal par chup hai ki party rahul kaa kya karegi, jo aise netaa nahin ban paae, jisaki bharat ko unase apeksha thi or congress ko aavashyaktaa thi
 This also raises the question that why senior leaders of the party did not keep this thing in front of the family before the election, so was their advice ignored? When all else fails, the Gandhi family is usually Burdens the party

 Every time after partition, the party has re-united and emerged as the only liberal, democratic, left-leaning party that represents India's thinking
 hamaari haar isliye hui, kyonki sarkaar shashan chalaane kaa kaushal bhul gai
 Jawaharlal Nehru University historian Mridula Mukherjee argues that the party must go back to the path of democracy, which was the basic foundation of the party till the 1970s
 unhone bataaya ki tab gram str se adhyaksh tak niyamit chunaav hua karte the or party ke bheetar ek alag sarkaar bhi hua karti thi
 The Grand Old Party of the country needs today, new ideas, a new idiom and a new face whose steps are set on the ground

 The trailer of Kangana Ranaut's film "manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi" has been released
 teen minute 19 second main jhaansi kii rani lakshmibai ke jivan ke kai pahaluon ko dikhaaya he
 Kangana Ranaut is in the lead role and she has also worked hard for this film, she has declared it her love and dream project
 kangana kii tarah hi phens ko bhi is film ke trailor kaa intjaar lambey vakt se tha
 After the trailer came out, the mixed response is being found on social media
 aaie jaanate hai aakhir kaisaa he film kaa trailor
 
 
 Trailer's three strengths and three drawbacks1
 kangana kii aawaaj:kangana ranut behtareen adaakara hai, isliye unase apekshaayen zyada hai
 Looking at the actress in Manikarnika's avatar, it seems that the character has power, but after listening to her dialogue, it does not seem that the character is alive
 period drama filmon main hameshaa aawaaj kaa ahm role hota he
 Well, this thing has been taken care of somewhere in the trailer, which is clearly revealed
 rani lakshmibai kaa kirdaar kangana ke liye chalange he, kyonki ye ek aisa kirdaar he jiske balidaan or bahaduree ke kisse har bachche ne sune hai
 In such a situation, the shortcomings of Kangana's character are clearly visible in the trailer of three minutes
 2
 Background Music: In the period drama film, background music plays the most important role
 ye baat aaj kaa darshak beete dinon relies hui kai filmon ko dekhakar saaf pataa chalata he
 Kangana's film cannot be compared to any other film just by watching the trailer
 lekin film ke ection seen ke aage kamjor becoground mujeec kii kami dikhti he
 3
 film ke samvaad:"manikarnika: da queen of jhaansi" film ke trailor kai behtareen samvaad hai
 But these dialogues do not reach the heart of the audience properly because of the voice
 kangana kii aawaaj ko jahaan technikali impruve kiya gaya he, wo samvaad achche hai
 But listening to the suppressed voice of the queen announcing the war breaks the sequence of the entire scene
 film ke behtareen point:1
 Action Scene: Action is the biggest part of the script written around Kangana's Eid
 ise nibhaane main kangana ne puri koshish kii he
 According to reports, Kangana learned Talwabi because of realizing all the action scenes
 unhone seen khatarnaak hone ke baavjood khud shoot kiye
 Kangana's great work can be seen in the action scene
 2
 Story of the film: The trailer of Manikarnika makes all those stories come alive, which we have heard since childhood with the queen of Jhansi
 kaise ek rani ne apane samraj ko bachaane ke liye apni jaan kii baaji laga di
 But there are many aspects of the life of Rani of Jhansi that even today the common man does not know deeply
 trailor dekhakar ye andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jhaansi kii rani ke jivan kai ankahe pahalu ko dikhaaya gaya he
 Like her young age, how a girl named Manikarnika became the queen of Jhansi, shows all these things
 bataur premika lakshmibai ke jivan kaa kirdaar, jo ek maa hone ke saath apane samraj ko bachaane vaali rani bhi hai
 Many such aspects are seen in the trailer

 Kangana's debut film as a director has also been in controversy for a long time and Krish, the director of this film, left the film in the middle
 iske baad kangana ranut ne film ke diarection kii kaman apane haathon main lee or ab kangana ko is film kaa sah nirdeshak hone kaa darja milegaa
 Kangana as an actor has flown her own fame in the industry, now it is her turn to see his direction
 har lihaaj se ye film kangana ranut ke bahut myne rakhti he
 Arvind Kejriwal of India Against Corruption has claimed that his decision to form the party was not of Anna Hazare himself, but he later backed down from this decision


 without giving any reason

 'main dharmsankat main funs gaya hum, ek taraf meraa desh he duusari taraf anna hai

 And finally, the survey conducted about the party was also Anna's suggested way
 kejariwal kaa kahana he
 
 
 'I am stuck in a religious dilemma, on one side is my country, on the other side there is Anna
 main kisko chunun
 
 
 Initially Anna was there but later he withdrew
 tippaniyan According to Kejriwal, when he asked Anna at the meeting of the Constitution Club about the changes on the political party issue, he said that '
 
 
 unka jawaab tha ki pehle main vah kah rahaa tha ab yah kah rahaa hum
 When i had agreed to it earlier, still accept it
 ' Not only this, according to Arvind Kejriwal, the first suggestion for forming a political party came from Anna in January, when he was in the hospital, he had also chosen the name of 'corruption-free India'
 or aakhir main party ko lekar jo survey karaae gaye vah bhi anna kaa hi sujhaayaa rasta tha

 While 17 new faces have joined the cabinet, the portfolios of many old ministers have also been reshuffled

 Veerappa Moily took charge as Petroleum Minister and MM Pallam Raju as Human Resource Development Minister
 moili ne jab nayaa kaarybhaar sambhaala, us vakt reddy maujuud nahin the
 He was given charge by RPN Singh, former Minister of State for Petroleum
 unki anupasthiti ne nae vivaad ko janm diya ki petroleum mantri ke pad se hataae jane par vah naaraaz hai
 Social activist turned politician Arvind Kejriwal also questioned Reddy's transfer from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to the Ministry of Science and Technology
 kejariwal ne kaha, "jaipal reddy ko eemaandaar vyakti mana jaataa he, phir bhi unhen hataa diya gaya
 Salman Khurshid, who has been exposed to corruption charges, has been promoted by the government
 " Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Venkaiah Naidu also sought clarification from the government if Reddy's department was changed
 unhone kaha, "pradhanmantri spasht karen ki jaipal reddy ko mahatvapurn vibhaag se hataakar maamuli mahatvaheen vibhaag kyon diya gaya, kya un par audyogic gharaanon kaa dabaav tha?" However, Reddy took over in the evening
 saath hi unhone naaraazgi sambandhi khabaron ko khaarij kar diya
 Speaking to reporters after taking charge, Reddy said, "before the change in the ministry, the Prime Minister had taken me into confidence and that is a lot for me
" main apane jivan main kabhi bhi mantralay ke peeche nahin bhaaga
 " yah puche jane par ki kya pradhanmantri ne unhen mantralay se badalane kaa kaaran bataaya, iske jawaab main unhone kaha, "kisi bhi mantri ko hataae jane kaa kaaran nahin bataaya jaataa he
 i think the Prime Minister should not even explain the reason for this
 " When asked why he did not personally hand over the work to Moily, Reddy replied, "I told the secretary that i would be able to come to office by five o'clock because i wanted to understand the functioning of the new ministry
" main samaaj vigyaan kaa chaatr rahaa hum na ki prakritik vigyaan kaa
 So i needed time
 vaise bhi main adhikari nahin hum ki kisi ko kaarybhaar saunpun
 " isse pehle kaarybhaar grahan karne ke baad moili ne kaha ki vah tel kshetra ke saamne aa rahi chunautiyon ko avasaron main tabdeel karne ke liye kaam karenge
 He said, "the average worldwide oil consumption is 14 barrels per capita per year while in developing countries it is three barrels per capita per year
 bharat main bhi sthiti bahut acchhee nahin he
 1 here 2 bairal prati vyakti prati varsh khapat he
 it's a matter of concern
 " On the other hand, soon after taking charge of the Railway Minister, Pawan Kumar Bansal said that the government has kept the option of increasing passenger fares open but it can be done to improve the services and not to make profit
 bansal ne mantralay kaa kaarybhaar sambhaalane ke kuch hi der baad ieenes se kaha, "yadi sevaayen behatar karne ke liye yatri kiraye par punarvichaar kii aavashyaktaa hui to ham aisa karenge
 Its purpose is not to earn profit
 " unhone kaha ki vah mangalvaar ko railway board ke saath is mudde par charchaa karenge or phir pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko charchaa ke nateezon se avgat karaayenge
 He said, "we want to run the Railways with uninterrupted financial principles

 com / gb9bsqbpvr The super debut of superstar Aamir Khan's much-talked-about TV show 'satyamev Jayate' has made the National Commission for Women her admirer
 ayog aamir ko mahila adhikaar sambandhi abhiyaanon se jodne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Commission chairperson Mamta Sharma said that we are thankful to Aamir that he chose the program like this (satyamev Jayate)
 iske pehle hi bhaag ko har ore se sakaaratmak pratikriya mil rahi he
 That is why we have planned to link Aamir with the women's rights campaigns of the Commission
 unhone kaha ki ayog kii ore se aamir ko kai baar phone bhi kiya gaya lekin abhi unase is sambandh main baat nahin hui he lekin aamir kii patni kiran raav se is bare main baat hui he
 The Commission runs a number of awareness campaigns related to women's rights and their interests, which include many topics like female feticide, dowry, child malnutrition

 aamir ne khud mukhyamantri ashok gahalot se mulaakaat karke is mudde ko uthaaya tha
 He said that the sting operation of Rajasthan was shown in Aamir's program, it should be taken as an example and Rajasthan should not be targeted only because the problem is not only of one state but the whole country

 yadav ne ham sangharsh karte rahenge
 Yogendra Yadav claimed that this happened due to the conspiracy of the Delhi government

 Yadav alleged that for two years, the government did not deliberately amend the Corporation Election Act
 jabaki supreme court ke nirdesh ko do saal or swaraj india kii arji ko ek saal se zyada ho gaya
 He said that for the first time, at least ten percent of the candidates of the party contesting the elections are given permission to contest elections on the common symbol

 Subsequently in 2016, Swaraj India also appealed to the Delhi government to amend the law
 apil par dilli sarkaar ne vichaar kaa jawaab diya

 Yogendra Yadav alleged that even after a year, the Delhi government did not take any decision

 But when the opportunity came for Swaraj India, the Aam Aadmi Party government started plotting

 paanch maichon kii siries ke duusare mukaable ko bhi jitkar team india apni lay banaae rakhana chaahegi
 Zimbabwe captain Brandon Taylor termed the toss's role in the second ODI against India at Harare Sports Club as crucial and said his batsmen would have to show a more positive attitude
 tailor ko vishwaas he ki yadi vah toss jeetne main safal rahete hai to phir unki team siries baraabar karne main safal ho sakati he
 He said, 'I think the toss is important
 isse bharat kii hamaare khilaaf shandaar jeet kaa mahatv kam nahin ho jaataa he
 i believe he showed why he is the number one team in the world
 ’ tailor ne kaha, ‘durbhaagya se toss hamaara saath nahin de paaya, lekin hamaare ballebaajon ko sakaaratmak ravaiya apnaane kii jarurat he
 Because with this we can win against better teams
 hamane is par charchaa bhi kii
 Rohit Sharma, who has been a success flag as an Indian opener, may have been a failure in the first match, but he would like to make up for it in the second match
 yahi haal shikhar dhawan or suresh raina kaa he, jo shuukravaar ko nishchit taur par haraare sports club maidan par badi paariyaan khilne kii manshaa se utrenge
 The tour of Zimbabwe has not been good for Raina so far
 2010 main captain ke taur par yahaan trikoniya siries khilne vaale raina ko is baat kii raahat hogi ki bhartiya team ne zimbabwe se pichhali siries main mili lagaataar do haar kaa hisaab baraabar kar liya
 But his personal performance in this African country is a matter of concern for him

 vinay ko ab mukhya tej gendbaaj banakar team kii jeet main yogadan dena hoga

 Obama said, it would be right to say that his extremist ideology poses a medium and long-term threat
 vahaan bahut saare samooh hai, jinaki tatkaal america ke khilaaf sambhavat: adhik unnat yojanaayen hai, jinhen lekar hamen lagaataar chaukas rahanaa hoga
 He said that it is traditional for such an organization that when they control an area, they are violent, their ideology is extremist and hence over time the local population rejects them

 Raghuraj Pratap Singh (raja Bhaiya), an independent MLA from Kunda in Pratapgarh in UP, has decided to form his political party
 wo savarna-muslim votbank ke jariye apni raajnneetik lakeer khinchne ja rahe hai
 Raja Bhaiya, who played an independent innings in his political career of twenty five years, is now going to start party politics
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle wo apni nai party ke saath najar aaenge
 In such a situation, this satrap of Uttar Pradesh has also decided its political agenda to increase its base
 savarnon par dore, SC / ST act ke khilaaf mukharshuukravaar ko lakhanu main apni press confeence main raja bhaiya ne kai sanket die hai
 First, it is clear that their political agenda is predominantly upper caste voters
 yahi vajah he ki unhone essi-asti act or aarakshan ke khilaaf aawaaj bulad karne kii baat kahi he
 Raja Bhaiya said that at present there are many political parties but they are only doing politics of casteism and reservation
 unhone spasht kiya ki unki party un logon kii aawaaj banegi jo essi / asti act ke shikaar hai or aarakshan kii vajah se berozegaar hai
 Raja Bhaiya said that if a Dalit girl is raped today, there is a provision for separate compensation for her
 agar vahiin saamaanya varg ke saath aisa hua to sarkaar kaa ravaiya alag hota he
 He said that crime should happen to anyone, everyone should see it with one eye
 yogyata ho pramotion kaa aadharraja bhaiya ne pramotion main aarakshan kaa bhi virodh kiya
 He said, "today there is talk of promotion in reservation, i believe that promotion should be on the basis of quality and seniority and not on the basis of caste
 " maujuuda aarakshan kii vyavastha ko lekar bhi raja bhaiya ne sawaal khadey kiye or kaha ki aarakshan yogyata ke aadhaar par ho
 Why should the IAS and IPS officers whose children are studying abroad be given the benefit of reservation? Bhaiyya, who has supported the Muslims, has adopted the strategy of promoting the upper caste vote bank
 vahiin, saath hi muslim maton ko lekar bhi ek lakeer khinchi he
 Raja Bhaiya has included two colors in his Jansatta Party flag
 pehla pilaa or doosraa haraa
 Yellow color is seen associated with Rajputs
 jabaki hare rang ko muslim samudaay main pavitra mana jaataa he
 Raja Bhaiya also cleaned his stand regarding the Ram temple
 unhone kaha ki ram mandir maamle par supreme court kaa jo bhi faisla hoga, use wo sweekaar karenge
 Muslim society is also repeating the same thing
 isse sanket saaf he ki unke raajnneetik agenda main muslimon ko bhi puri tarah se jagah di gai he
 In fact, there are a large number of Muslim voters in Kunda assembly constituency
 muslim matadaataaon par raja bhaiya kii acchhee khaasi pakad he
 In such a situation, in order to keep his victory intact, Raja Bhaiya does not want to annoy the Muslims under any circumstances

 There is a lot of news about Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh's daughter Sara Ali Khan's Bollywood debut
 iske bare main bahut kuch likhaa jaataa he
 Sometimes it is reported that she will make her Bollywood debut with Karan Johar's 'student of the Year 2', and sometimes there are reports that she will be seen in Hrithik Roshan's Opposite Film
 haalanki abhi tak kuch conform nahin ho paaya tha
 But during a conversation with India Today, director Abhishek Kapoor himself has confirmed that Sara is going to debut with Sushant Singh Rajput in his upcoming film 'kedarnath'
 kya shahrukh ke bete ke saath banegi saf kii beti kii jodi?kuch samay pehle yah khabar ai thi ki karan johar ne sara ko apni film ke liye sin kiya he
 a few days ago, she was also seen at Karan's birthday party
 sara kii bollywood main entry abhi bhale hi naa hui ho lekin wo abhi se bollywood ke bade stars ke saath poj detii najar aati hai
 Jahnavi and Sara, who reached Karan's party in tashan, whose look best tell that Sushant Singh Rajput also started his film career with Abhishek Kapoor's 'kai Po Che'
 kuch samay pehle sara ke papa saf ali khan ne ek intervyuu main kaha tha, 'karan johar newcomers ko bahut achche se launch karte hai
 i think she is the best for Sara
 wo bahut hi achche or budhimaan filmekar hai
 He has a very good understanding of cinema
 ' a new avatar has come to the politics of Muslims in Uttar Pradesh
 ye henall india majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin(eimm) ke adhyakaisadauddin ovaisi
 Lok Sabha member from Hyderabad Asaduddin Owaisi inherited politics from his father Salauddin Owaisi
 kabhi hyderabad tak simit eimm ne haal hi menmaharashtra vidhansabhaki do siten jitkar vahaan kii siyaasi zamin par kadam rakhe hai
 Owaisi is now eyeing Uttar Pradesh, the state with the largest Muslim population
 uttar pradesh main muslim maton par apana haq jataane vaali samaajawaadee party ovaisi kii aahat se pareshaan he
 SP leader Azam Khan is most worried
 sapa main aazam khan ko soobe kaa muslim cheharaa mana jaataa he
 SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav also considers Azam Khan a lot
 sarkaar main unka mukaam duusare nambar par mana jaataa he
 In many cases, he also appears in the role of Super CM
 khud ko pradesh ke musalamaanon kaa sabase bada netaa samajhane vaale aazam khan ovaisi kii kabaliyat or unke hunar se acchhee tarah waakif hai
 He kept on stopping the height of Muslim leaders from being higher than himself in SP but could not understand how to stop Owaisi
 yahi vajah he ki ovaisi ko azamgarh main sabha karne kii ijazat nahin di gai
 Azam Khan realizes that Owaisi's arrival in UP may reduce his importance in Muslim society
 haalanki, ajam kii is soch kaa upi main pehle bhi duusare muslim netaa virodh karte rahe hai
 Shahid Siddiqui, a Rajya Sabha member, is the biggest example of this
 peshey se patrkaar siddiki kaa sapa se judaav kabhi bhi aazam khan ko raas nahi aayaa
 Azam forced him out of the party as soon as he got a chance
 darasal shahid apane akhbaar ke liye narendra modi kaa intervyuu kar aae the
 But Owaisi comes from another political party which itself is called the party raising the voice of Muslims

 Among the leaders whose fate is to be decided on February 11, Rajnath Singh's son Pankaj Singh, BJP national spokesperson Srikanth Sharma, Congress Legislature Party leader Pradeep Mathur, BJP vice-president Laxmikant Bajpai, Hukum Singh's daughter Mriganka Singh and the riots were discussed

 The question of who will die the most in the first phase elections will be of the Bahujan Samaj Party, which has a strong hold in this area
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jab puure rajya main samaajawaadee party kii hawa thi tab bhi pashchimi uttar pradesh main bispi ne acha pradarshan kiya tha
 This time, Bahujan Samaj Party has tried the dalit-muslim alliance by giving tickets to most Muslims
 yah gathjod kaam kar rahaa he yaa nahin isaki bhi pariksha pehle charan main hi ho jaaegi
 In order to thwart this move of Bahujan Samaj Party, the Samajwadi Party has joined hands with the Congress so that Muslim votes come in its favor

 At the time of the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had won this area in the post-muzaffarnagar riots
 bijepi kii koshish hogi kii vaisaa hi shandaar pradarshan phir se doharaaya jaae
 But it would be very difficult for the BJP to perform brilliantly like Lok Sabha elections because at that time Jat voters strongly supported the BJP
 lekin ab aarakshan nahin die jane se jat matadaata bijepi se naaraaz hai or isi naaraazgi kaa phayda uthaane ke liye ajit singh kaa rashtriya lokdal puri takat laga rahaa he

 Both have easily crossed the 145 mark of majority

 maa,aapako pataa he log kehete hai main bilkul aapke jaisi dikhaai detii hum
 i am not as tall as you, but the face, eyes, color are all like you

 The pain of not being there increases when you look at your photo
 bahut baar aapaki kami ne rulaayaa he
 i will not lie, the more hurt you are, the more angry you become
 bahut zyada gussa
 
 
 Eight girls lived with me in PG
 unke liye ghar janaa kisi celibrasion kii tarah hota tha
 i loved going home but i was not crazy like them
 unke paas bahut si vajahen hoti thim or mere paas sirf itani kibaaki gharavaalon se milanaa he
 She used to say that this time she will go home and sleep a lot, she will eat curd and big curry from her mother
 laddu banavaakar laaenge
 
 
 They will eat, they will eat
 bal main tel lagavaayenge or pataa nahin kya-kya
 When she went home, she used to pack dirty clothes in a bag
 kahati thim ki mummy dho dengi
 When she returned from home, that one bag of hers turned into three or four small bags
 ek main daal, chaaval, aataa or jarurat kaa sara saamaan hota tha
 In one, they had their favorite food items and in one their new clothes with washed clothes
 jis din wo lautati thim, us raat wo mujhe apane kamare main bulaati thim
 Used to show goods and give food and drink
 mujhe acha lagata tha lekin man hi man mujhe unase bahut jalan hoti thi
 very much
 apni kamatari kaa ehsaas hota tha
 It felt very bad that day too when i was going to start a new life
 sab khadey the mere saath lekin aap nahin thim
 Everyone was saying i look very beautiful, i wanted to hear this from you
 chaahati thi meri har rasm aapke haath se ho par aisa nahin hua
 i cried a lot that day
 or kabhi-kabhi aapke bare main kalpanaaen kar-karke hi khush ho jaati
 That day really felt that there are many such occasions in the life of a daughter when she needs only her mother and only she wants it
 ab meraa apana ek chota sa ghar he jise main bahut jatan se rakhti hum
 Like you used to keep
 aapse bahut kuch siikhaa lekin khaanaa bananaa nahin siikhaa or iskaa khamiyaja ab bhugat rahi hum
 i cook by looking on youtube or by asking on mobile
 aapse aisi dheron choti-badi shikaayatein hai lekin main khush hum ki aapane mujhe kabhi 'phool-kumari' kii tarah treet nahin kiya
 Strengthened
 har wo kaam sikhaaya jiske bina cervive karnaa mushkil ho jaataa or sabase badi baat khud par bharosa karnaa sikhaaya
 i do ek maa apane bacchon ko bahut kuch sikhaati he,jindagibhar sikhaati rahati he lekin jo sabase jaruri cheez sikhaati haivo he vishwaas karnaa
 On himself and on those who are really there for him
 aapane kam samay main hi mujhe ye sikhaa diya
 If you were, i would have learned a lot more
 sabakuch or acha hota
 
 
 But it is my strength to be without you
 thankyuu itnaa sabakuch dene ke liye
 
 
 Happy Mother's Day Mummy
 or haa
 
 
 i drink a glass of milk every evening
 jaisaa ki aapane niyam banaaya tha lekin main ab bhi utani hi dubli-patali hum
 
 
 As much as you left
 aapaki betaa

 ' Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni may have looked extremely upset with his team's defeat at the hands of Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL-8 but coach Stephen Fleming said there was nothing wrong with the captain
 dhoni ke liye yah match acha nahin rahaa
 He was bowled by Piyush Chawla's googly by scoring only one run
 iske baad jab robin uthppa 28 ran par the tab unhone stamping kaa sunaharaa mauka ganvaaya
 The KKR opener later scored an unbeaten 80 to lead his team to a seven-wicket victory
 fleming ne match ke baad samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘beshak aapako emes (dhoni) ko prayek match jitate hue dekhne kii aadat pad gai he
 It is unusual to see him under pressure like this, but he is right
 vah acha abhyaas kar rahaa he, kadaa abhyaas kar rahaa he
 He is boosting the morale of the team
 is tarah ke vyast kaarykram main aapke paas samiksha karne kaa bahut adhik samay nahin hota
 The former New Zealand captain said that Ravichandran Ashwin's injury came as a shock to csk's hopes of registering a second successive win against KKR
 unhone kaha, ‘vah nishchit taur par behtareen gendbaaj he or hamen uski kami khali
 'fleming praised Brad Hogg, who took four wickets for 29 runs from KKR
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley do maichon main usne bejod pradarshan kiya
 He turned the match in favor of KKR
 vah nishchit rup se aaj unka mukhya khilaadi rahaa
 Input: language captain kool emes dhoni ne team india ko cricket ke har formet main bulandiyon tak pahunchaaya
 But this Ranchi boy wanted to be something else, not a cricketer
 dhoni ne bataaya ki vah bachapan se hi faujee bananaa chaahate the
 He used to go for frequent visits to the Cantt area of ranchi, but luck was a bit more accepted, he could not become an officer of the army and became a cricketer
 cricketer nahin 'jawan' bananaa chaahate the dhonidhoni ne ye khulaasa sena ke javaanon ke bich kiya
 Dhoni spent a day in the parachute regiment of the military with the jawans and was the fastest channel Aaj Tak to witness these special moments
 dhoni cricketer to hai hi, saath hi terrytorial army main leftinent karnal bhi hai
 Mahi learned a lot from the soldiers, Dhoni enjoyed a whole day in Parachute Regiment
 javaanon se baaten kin, unase bahut kuch siikhaa
 Mark saw the drill
 aatanki hamale ke vakt faujee kis tarah morche par dat jate hai, dhoni ne ye sab dekha or siikhaa bhi
 Fans of shooting, Dhoni went to the shooting range and fired heavily
 captain kool ne yahaan khub hansi majaak bhi kiya
 'something is special in uniform', Dhoni told in Ajatak's show Solid Jawan, Star Captain that he is very scared of height
 iske baavjood dhoni ne fain jump kiya
 When he came up from the bottom, he said, 'there is something special in this uniform
 shaayad is vardi kaa kamaal he jo mujhe dar nahin laga
 "I am a poet of two moments
" 
 
 'dhoni ne iske baad shaam ko chaay ke baad javaanon ke saath shandaar mehfil jamaai
 The jawans sang a lot of songs and also danced
 dhoni se javaanon ne dance kii farmaaish kii, lekin dhoni ne kaha ki jab wo agali baar aaenge to jarur naachenge
 Then Dhoni told the jawans, 'I am a poet of two moments
 
 
 'press conference se pehle frij main baith jate hai dhoni!javaanon ne dhoni se khub sawaal bhi puche
 a young man asked how you stay so cool
 is par dhoni ne jawaab diya, 'jis din mujhe press conference kerani hoti he, usase ek din pehle main frij main jaakar baith jaataa hum, isiilie kool rahata hum
 Mahi wants to serve the country
 
 
 dhoni javaanon se badi garmjoshi se mili
 He also praised openly
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main dhoni ne kaha, 'bachapan se hi main sena main janaa chahta tha
 Often went to the Army Area in Ranchi
 vahaan javaanon ko dekhakar sochataa tha ki ek din main bhi aisa hi banuunga
 "after being a cricketer, in response to a question about joining the army again, Dhoni said," i want to serve the country
 or is tarah se mujhe desh kii seva karne kaa mauka mila to maine manjuur kar liya
 'army jawans can play in IPL,' a jawan asked, 'you became a military as a cricketer and why can't we become a cricketer as a military, why can't we play in the IPL?' To this Dhoni said, 'cricket is a game that anyone can play
 koi bandish nahin he
 You can also play IPL
 agar aapke andar badhiya cricket khilne kii khubi he to aapako bhi khilne kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 '
 
 
 or dhoni ho gaye imotionalsena ke javaanon ke saath dhoni ke kai andekhee, anjaane pahalu saamne aae
 Dhoni got a different face when he met the widows and children of the soldiers
 dhoni imotional ho gaye
 Spent time with the children of military widows, fulfilled all their demands
 unhen autograph diya or tasviren bhi khinchvaai

 The DRS is not taking the name of the dispute to a halt, starting with the second match of the four-test series played between India and Australia in Bengaluru
 jahaan isisi ne steve smith or viraat kohli par koi bhi karrwai karne se manaa kar diya he, vahiin bhartiya cricket control board ne bhi lambey vimarsh ke baad apni shikaayat waapas le lee he
 After these steps, it was believed that the matter would now settle down, but its discussion is now going on with the media and many players
 is bich ek australian newspaper ne to isse hatakar team india ke captain viraat kohli or coach anil kumble ko hi nishane par le liya he or un par kai sansanikhej aarope laga die hai, jisase is maamle ne phir jor pakad liya he
 According to the newspaper, the Indian captain and coach have acted against the spirit of the game during the Bangalore Test
 aaie jaanate hai ki newspaper ne koun-se aarope madhe hai
 
 
 During the second innings of the Bengaluru Test, Steve Smith sought to help the dressing room after he was dismissed by the umpire
 haalanki ampire ne unhen aisa karne se roak diya tha, lekin kai purv cricketron or bhartiya media ne ise khel bhaavana ke khilaaf bataate hue smith par karrwai kii maang kii thi, jabaki australian cricket board or vahaan ke media ne steve smith kaa paksh lete hue unka bachaav kiya tha
 Now a newspaper has not only defended Smith, but has also made several allegations against Team India head coach Anil Kumble and captain Virat Kohli
 da daily telegraph ne apni report main likhaa he ki bhartiya captain viraat kohli ne ek australian adhikari ko energy drink kii bottle (gatorade) se maaraa he
 Not only this, the newspaper has also alleged that Indian coach and former spinner Anil Kumble entered the box of officials during the match to seek clarification after Virat Kohli was dismissed in the second innings
 tippaniyan According to the paper, although international coaches are not allowed to enter the box of officials, but this is not seen in the middle match
 isse aage badhate hue paper ne yah bhi likhaa he ki saal 2007-08 kii border-gavaskar siries ke dauraan harbhajan singh or andryu symonds ke bich hue mankigate cond main bhi kumble ne mukhya prerak kii bhoomika nibhaai thi
 According to the paper, Kumble played a role behind the scenes in all these
 report main viraat kohli par yah bhi aarope lagaaya gaya he ki unhone australian box kii ore ashleel bhashaa kaa istemaal karne ke saath hi ballebaaj peter hendscomb kii ore gardan retane kaa ishaara bhi kiya tha
 Along with this, the newspaper has described Virat Kohli as a villain and compared him to former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga and described him as a victim of sportsmanship
 report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki is match main unki ore se kai baar khel bhaavana ko taak par rakhaa gaya
 The newspaper has also targeted the ICC, saying, "by not taking any action on the bad behavior inside and outside Virat Kohli's ground in Bengaluru, the ICC has kind of cleared a chaos in Test cricket
" ' Significantly, in a conversation with NDTV, former India captain and greatest batsman Sunil Gavaskar also lambasted the ICC for not taking action on Steve Smith and said that if Virat also does something similar to Smith in the next Test, Then what will happen
 matlab saaf he ki donon hi paksh apni ore se ek-duusare par karrwai kii maang kar rahe hai
 There is a possibility that the matter may be stretched a bit longer

 paper ke anusaar vaise to international kochon ko adhikariyon ke box main jane kii manaahi nahin hoti, lekin bich match main aisa dekha nahin jaataa
 Going further, the paper has also written that Kumble played the main motivator in the Monkeygate scandal between Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds during the 2007-08 border-gavaskar series
 paper ke anusaar kumble ne in sabamein parde ke peeche se bhoomika nibhaai he
 The report also accused Virat Kohli of using obscene language towards the Australian box, as well as making a gesture of slapping neck towards batsman Peter Handscomb
 iske saath hi newspaper ne viraat kohli ko villen bataate hue unki tulana srilanka ke purv captain arjuna rantunga se kii he or unhen khel bhaavana ko thes pahunchane vaala bataaya he
 The report also said that in this match, the spirit of the game was kept on hold several times
 newspaper ne isisi par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha he, "bengaluru main viraat kohli ke maidan ke bheetar or baahar ke kharaab vyavhaar par koi karrwai nahin karke isisi ne ek tarah se test cricket main ek prakaar kii araajaktaa ko hari jhandi de di he
 ' gauratlab he ki NDTV se baatcheet main team india ke purv captain or mahanatam ballebaaj sunil gavaskar ne bhi isisi ko steve smith par karrwai nahin karne ko lekar latada tha or kaha tha ki yadi iske baad viraat bhi agle test main smith jaisaa hi kuch karte hai, to phir kya hoga
 This means that both sides are demanding action on their part
 aise main sambhaavna he ki yah maamla kuch or lanbaa khinch jaae

 chalati train main khaane-pine kii chizon ke vaazib daam logon ko bataane ke iraade se rail mantralay mobile ap develop karaane ja rahaa he
 The Railway Ministry is receiving more than one lakh complaints of overcharging of food items through social media every month
 railway ke aalaa afasaron ke mutabik train main vendoron kii jimmedaari he ki wo railway ke tay rate par logon ko khaane-pine kii chijen muhaiyaa karaaen, lekin aisa aamtaur par nahin ho rahaa he
 The Ministry is deeply concerned about this
 khaas baat yah he ki rail mantralay ko soshal media par mil rahi kul 1 lakh shikayaton main takreeban 29000 shikaayatein, khaane pine kii chizon kii ghatiya quality or overcharging kii hoti hai
 From time to time, the Ministry of Railways keeps fine on the vendors concerned, but in spite of all this, there is no shortage of complaints related to this problem
 railgadiyon main shatabdi or rajdhani jaisi kai premium trainon main iarsitisi khan-paan muhaiyaa karaati he, lekin desh bhar main zyaadaatar trainon main khan-paan kaa jimmaa privet vendors ke paas he
 It is also true that a large number of food and drink companies have got different companies of the same vendor
 trainon ke andar nijee vendor jo khaanaa paroste hai wo yaa quality main kharaab hota he, nahin to isaki keemat zyada vasuuli jaati he
 For example, the fixed price inside the water bottle train is Rs 15, but in most places the vendors are charging more than the fixed price and apart from this the local brand is being sold in trains at a higher price than the fixed brand Rail Neer or its equivalent brand

 Due to this, the Ministry of Railways had taken the initiative of ordering food online through mobile to IRCTC
 in sabake baavjood mobile par online khaanaa book karaane kaa chalan jor nahin pakad paa rahaa he
 Therefore, the concern of the Ministry of Railways has doubled, where on one hand the campaign to book food on online on demand mobile is failing, while on the other hand private vendors are rigged in food and drink
 is sthiti se nipatane ke liye rail mantralay ne pichley kuch dinon se railway apane twitor handle par lagaataar logon ko overcharging kii shikaayat karne ke liye muhim chalaa rahi he

 rajya congress adhyaksh ke rup main bharat singh solanki kii vaapasi or unki twarit koshishen party main jaan phoonk rahi hai
 Bharat Singh, the son of former Gujarat Chief Minister and veteran Congressman Madhav Singh Solanki, is making every effort to cheer the party ahead of the crucial local body elections scheduled to be held in October and assembly elections in 2017
 isse pehle ve 2006 se 2008 tak is pad par rah chuke hai
 From disciplining workers to chalking out allocation of party posts, Solanki has shown confidence with his first move
 1 march ko pad sanbhaalane ke ek maah ke bheetar unhone rajya congress main mahasachivon kii sankhya 32 se kam karke 8, upaadhyakshon kii sankhya 13 se 7 or pravaktaaon kii sankhya 10 se 4 kar di he
 His predecessor Arjun Modhwadia resigned after taking moral responsibility for not winning any of the 26 seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 congress ke ek netaa kehete hai, "party ko sabji bazaar main tabdeel kar diya gaya tha, solanki ne uskaa sammaan lautaaya he
 "solanki has formed two-member committees for each of the 30 district units to prepare the party's full report card in view of the civic elections
 bijepi ne 2006 or 2010 ke chunaavon main congress kaa safaya kar diya tha
 He has set up separate committees for urban areas where the BJP has always beaten the Congress

 The Congress got its last victory in the state assembly elections 20 years ago in 1995
 solanki kii sabase badi chunauti modi kii shishyaa anandiben patel hai
 Patel is leaving no stone unturned for the 2017 elections, whether it is her decision of 50 per cent reservation for women in local autonomous bodies or presenting the first gender-budget, with 67 schemes dedicated to women
 patel ne 'gatisheel gujarat' kaa naaraa bhi diya he jisamen unhone tay lakshyon ko hasil karne ke liye ek vishesh samay-seemaa nirdhaarit kii he
 But Solanki seems hopeful in the fact that he belongs to the OBC Kshatriya caste and is more important against the Patel Chief Minister in the state
 yahaan patel-kshatriya shatruta kaa itihaas rahaa he
 He has appointed two Patel leaders as vice presidents to strengthen their position and also woo the Patel vote bank

 On the issue of minimum support price for cotton, groundnut and sugar, they are preparing to surround the central government and the BJP

 They are very angry with the BJP
 " kapaas ke mudde par congress kaa kahana he ki upie ne nunatam samarthan mulya 11 ru
 Increased from Rs
 800 to Rs
 kar diya tha
 It is hopeful that the withdrawal of the income tax exemption given by the sugar cooperative companies by the Central Government will also prove to be anti-farmer
 vahiin gujarat akelaa rajya he, jo urvarkon par 4 fisadi waite lagaakar unhen mahangaa bana detaa he
 When asked about the upcoming challenges, Solanki did not give a clear answer, "we are thinking more about increasing our strengths rather than the weaknesses of our opponents
 hamaara kaam bolegaa
 The 2014 Lok Sabha election was an exception and cannot be taken as a standard
 "par do dashak ke baad rajya main vaapasi karnaa solanki or congress ke liye aasaan nahin he
 The Prime Minister can go to any extent to ensure the victory of his pupil
 solanki ko philhal party ke sanghathanaatmak dhaanche ko majboot karnaa he, kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal badhanaa he or congress kii jeet kii sambhaavna banane kii disha main mehnat kerani he
 Solanki, who lost his Anand Lok Sabha seat at the hands of the BJP in 2014, knows that he will not get any concession in his efforts to maintain his and Congress's relevance in the state

 Nitish's departure in the NDA camp is also being said to be a bit of a shock at the opposition dream of National Grand Alliance before 2019

 The Public Accounts Committee of Parliament has accepted a report related to the Commonwealth scandal criticizing the role of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 report main kya he?-manmohan singh ke adheen pradhanmantri karyaalay ne kalmari ko kaamanwealth games aayojan samiti kaa adhyaksh banane or taiyaariyon kii nigaraanee kii jimmedaari se pallaa jhaada
 The then PMO argued 'misleading' that the Ministry of Sports has the responsibility of not dividing the minutes of the cabinet group meeting in connection with the Games on 14 January 2014
 - pradhanmantri karyaalay ko jimmedaari se pallaa jhaadne ke bajaae taiyaariyon par nigaah rakhni chahie thi
 - The then Cabinet Secretariat failed to determine the accountability associated with the organization of the Games and kept on kneeling under constant political pressure
 -cameti jimmedaari se bachane kii is rivaayat kii ninda karti he or ummid karti he ki piemo / cabinet sachivalay aise maamalon main misaal pesh karegaa
 It was a 'costly mistake' to hand over the command of the organizing committee to Kalmadi, bypassing the objections of the then Sports Minister Sunil Dutt
 khulengi ghotaalon kii band filanglok lekha samiti ne sibiai ko ghotaale se jude chah maamalon kii filein dobaaraa kholane ko kaha he
 Apart from this, he has also directed to speed up the investigation of corruption cases involving senior members of the Organizing Committee

 The petitioners, challenging the constitutional legality of Aadhaar, were asked by the Supreme Court on Thursday that they had difficulty in sharing their address proof with the government, while they had no problem in sharing information with private parties
 maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan justise chandrachud ne kaha, 'agar aapako insurance chahie to aap privet party ke paas jate hai
 If you want a phone, you go to a private party

 But if the government asks, it gets attached to your identity
 'paanch jajon kii sanvaidhanik benchamen se ek justise chandrachud ne kaha, 'agar aap naukari ke liye applai karte hai, to ve sabase pehle aapkaa adress pruf maangate hai or aapaki selary kisi privet bank main jamaa kii jaati he
 Justice AK Sikri appeared to Shyam Dewan appearing on behalf of the petitioners, "your argument seems to be that if i give my passbook to them, they would like to know my bank withdrawal
" mujhe nahin lagata ki ye koi maamla he
 Dewan said that there is a difference between sharing information with a recognized private party and an unknown private company
 unhone kaha, 'sawaal ye he ki kya sarkaar ek privet party ko jaankaree dene ke liye logon ko majaboor kar sakati he, joki yuidiai ke control se puri tarah baahar he or vah us jaankaree ko vyavsaayik taur par upyog karne ke liye swatantra he
 On this, Justice Chandrachud said that the court would like to know what measures have been taken by the Unique Identification Authority of India to keep personal data safe
 dewan ne kaha ki tark ye he ki aadhaar kaa namakan svaichhik tha, lekin agar isko sabhi sevaaon ke liye jaruri bana diya jaataa he to ye puri tarah acadmic eksrasij ho jayega
 Referring to the Introducer system - in which a person has to refer to an Aadhaar card holder for his identity - Diwan said that the purpose was that those who do not have any identity will get an identity, as the government claims Was, and Aadhaar was helping in this

 He said that the concern of the petitioners is that the veracity of the information collected by the private nominees has been approved by the government through its statement in Parliament

 Dewan said that the statement given on 10 April 2017 said that in the last 6 years, the government has blacklisted and canceled 34 thousand operators who tried to tamper with the system

 The committee was formed on 31 May last year under the leadership of Pratyush Sinha
 samiti ne kaha ki saude ke liye devas kaa chayan karne se lagata he ki paardarshita or jaruri soch
 There was a lack of thought
 report ke anusaar manjuuri kii prakriya kendriya mantrimandal or antariksh ayog ko adhuri tathaa galat jaankaree dene se bhi judi he
 The antrix-dewas agreement was signed on January 28, 2005, but no information was given in the note dated 27 November 2005 in the Space Commission or Cabinet
 ukt note main sahmati ke tahat banaaye jane vaale jisat 6 upgrah ke prakshepan ke liye anumati maangi gayi thi
 The report stated that the terms of the antrix-dewas agreement were largely in favor of Dewas
 report ke mutabik, sahmati kii sharton main kaha gaya he ki upgrah kii vifaltaa kii sthiti main jokhim puri tarah antariksh vibhaag uthayega
 It also states that surprisingly, Dewas has been treated as an international customer for the purpose of arbitration while its registered address in the contract is shown in Bangalore
 report is baat ko bhi ujagar karti he ki entrix-devas saude ke liye antariksh vibhaag or vitt mantralay ke kanoonee prakoshthon se koi manjuuri nahin lee gayi jaisaa ki bharat sarkaar ke kisi vibhaag dwaara koi antarrashtriya qaraar karne ke liye anivaary he
 It said that the gsat's capacity for Dewas was marked without consulting the INSAT Corporation Committee (ICC), which is a clear violation of government policy
 samiti kii report kahati he ki is baat ke saboot hai ki praayogic pareekshanon par vichaar karte samay takneekee paraamarsh samooh (tingi) ko entrix-devas qaraar ke bare main nahin bataaya gaya
 It states that no attempt was made to locate other potential partners to provide this service, while in some other countries such service is also available
 report ke anusaar, satcom niti or isisi dishanirdeshon main pehle aao
 There is a lack of transparency in not clarifying the intent in selecting Dewas in view of allowing leasing for satellite capacity on the lines of first served
 samiti kii report ke anusaar, aisa jaanboojhkar kiya gaya lagata he ki jisat-6e upgrah ke liye antariksh ayog se manjuuri patr maangate samay bhi saude kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya

 darasal, FRDI (financial rijolution and dipasit insurance) bill ko lekar ashankaon ke chalate logon main bade noton (2000 or 500) ko apane paas hold karke rakhana badha he
 At the same time, the government has intensified both supply and printing to end the shortage of notes in many parts of the country
 vitt mantralay ke pramukh aarthik salaahkaar sanjeev sanyaal kaa daawa he ki had se had ek hafte ke bheetar har jagah sthiti puri tarah saamaanya ho jaaegi
 All India Bank Officers Confederation (AIBOC) Delhi region head Ravindra Gupta also says that it may take 7 to 10 days for the situation to return to normal
 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main sanyaal ne kaha ki is samay nagdi ko lekar jo hai tauba machi he vah puri tarah se chaunkaane vaali he kyonkiriserv bank ke paas kashki koi kami nahin he
 According to Sanyal, the government is investigating deeply how suddenly the demand for cash has increased so much without any reason
 sanyaal ne bataaya ki is dikkat kii shuruyaat pehle karnataka or telugana se shuru hui or phir desh ke kuch duusare hisson main fail gai
 Elections are due in Karnataka next month
 sanyaal ne kuch jagahon par cash kii maamuli dikkat kii tulana notebandi ke dinon se karne ko galat bataaya, wo isliye kyonki sarkaar ke paas ab kisi bhi sthiti se nipatane ke liye rigerv main paryaapt cash maujuud he
 He said that sometimes in some area there is a shortage of notes of some special value
 agar jarurat se zyada nakadi bazaar main utaar di jaae to use mahangaai par asar padataa he
 According to Sanyal, the good thing for the government at this time is that inflation is under control and that is why the government has no problem in printing the currency by printing the note
 nakadi se nipatane ke liye vitt mantralay ne ek task force banaai he jo sthiti kii nigaraanee kar rahaa he or kuch hi dinon ke bheetar sthiti puri tarah saamaanya ho jaaegi
 The Chief Economic Advisor of the Finance Ministry said that the election could be the only reason for this, but there are some things together that suddenly increased the demand for cash
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya iske peeche jaanboojhkar kii gai sajeesh bhi ho sakati he to unhone iskaa sidhaa jawaab nahin diya
 He simply said that the government has gathered to find out the reasons
 sutron ke mutabik sarkaar kaa yah maananaa he ki is vakt note ko lekar jo dikkat ho rahi he uske peeche sarkaar ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh bhi ho sakati he
 When Sanjeev Sanyal was asked if the government had stopped the supply of 2000 canots, he admitted that 2000 notes have not been supplied for the last few months
 ye isliye kyonki yah pataa chalaa ki chote note logon ke zyada kaam aate hai
 But if the need is felt, then 2000 notes can be printed and launched in the market
 unhone is sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ki 2000 ke note log apane paas jamaa kar rahe hai or ho saktaa he isamen se kuch kaala dhan ho
 Sanyal denied that people are losing their trust in banks due to bank scams
 unhone kaha ki ghotaale pehle bhi hote the lekin fark itnaa he ki yah sarkaar in ghotaalon kii jad main jaakar unhen saamne laa rahi he or unhen thik karne ke liye thos kadam uthaa rahi he
 Asked whether there may be apprehension about the FRDI bill in the minds of people due to lack of notes, he said that the government has made it clear many times about this that people's money in banks is completely safe and There is no need for anyone to worry about this
 vahiin AIBOC ke dilli kshetra ke pramukh gupta kaa maananaa he ki nakadi kii kami pramukh taur par bade mulya vaale noton par nirbhar rahane kii vajah se he
 Of all the currency in the country, 90 percent of them are in 2000 and 500 rupee notes
 gupta 2000 ke noton kii jamkhori hone kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin karte
 The hoarding of notes of this value has increased since the RBI stopped printing 2000 notes a few months ago
 iske alaava rajyon ko unke anupaat ke hisaab se samaan rup se cash vitarit nahin kiya ja rahaa, is vajah se bhi kuch rajyon main cash kii killat mahasoos kii ja rahi he

 Rather, the government appeared to be keeping distance from Sushma Swaraj's plea
 sushamaa swaraj ek kushal vaktaa hai
 With his eloquence, he tried to cover up many cases
 phir bhi vah kwotroki or anderson maamalon samet congress kii galatiyon par hi hamalaa karte dikhin
 When she spoke in defense of her husband and daughter, she had neither edge nor aggression
 is bare main unke bayanon ko saavdhaanee se sunne par pataa chal jaataa he ki vah utane aatmavishvaas or mukharata se nahin bol rahi thi
 After this whole issue arose, the internal politics of BJP is also being discussed continuously
 tippaniyan The cold war between Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley is well known
 to kya isiliye sushamaa swaraj kaa sabase tikhaa hamalaa pi chidambaram or unki patni nalni chidambaram ke maamle ko lekar tha
 Those who understand politics will tell that the attack on P
 Chidambaram is being viewed as a target on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley from a political point of view
 udhar ek sawaal ye bhi he ki sarkaar ne vipaksh ko itane dinon tak hangaamaa karne kaa mauka kyon diya? kya isse sushamaa swaraj kamazor nahin hui
 If the same debate was held in Parliament after two or three days of uproar, then Sushma Swaraj would not have looked so weak
 yah is puure maamle ke saamne aane ke baad pradhananmatri ne chuppi hi saadhe rakhi he
 When Arun Jaitley also rose to speak on this matter, he too was favoring the government and not Sushma's side
 unke bolon se ye bhi saaf nahin hua ki kya sarkaar sushamaa swaraj kii maanviya aadhaar par kii gai madad kii daleel vaali baat par unke saath he? balki sarkaar to sushamaa swaraj kii daleel se duuri banaate huye dikhi
 Sushma Swaraj is a skilled speaker
 apni vakpatutaa se unhone kai maamalon ko dhakne kii koshish kii
 Still, she was seen attacking Congress mistakes, including the Quattrocchi and Anderson cases
 jab apane pati or beti ke bachaav main boleen to usamen na to dhar thi na aakraamakata
 After listening carefully to her statements, it is revealed that she was not speaking with confidence and assertiveness
 is puure maamle ke uthne ke baad bijepi kii andruni raajnneeti kii charchaa bhi lagaataar ho rahi he
 The comments sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali ke bich to shityudh jagazahir he
 So, that is why Sushma Swaraj's fiercest attack was about the case of P
 Chidambaram and his wife Nalani Chidambaram
 jo raajnneeti ko samajhate hai vah bataayenge ki pi chidambaram par hamale ko siyaasi nazar se vittamantri arun jetali par nishane ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, there is also a question, why did the government give the opposition a chance to create a ruckus for so many days? Did this not weaken Sushma Swaraj
 yahi bahes agar sansad main do teen din ke hangaame ke baad kara lee jaati to shaayad sushamaa swaraj itani kamazor na dikhti

 lekin diggaj abhinayta ashok kumaar kii baat maanate hue vah ruuk gaye jo hindi cinema ke sangeet ke lihaaj se vardaan sabit hua
 Sachin Dev gave great music in several films of Vimal Rai, Guru Dutt, Hrishikesh Mukherjee besides Dev Anand's Navketan banner

 On the one hand, superstar Rajesh Khanna emerged from this film, while the career of singer Kishore Kumar also got a new height
 sachin dev un sangeetkaaron main the jinhone badalte vakt ke saath talmail bithaae rakhaa or jab unke saath ke sangeetkaaron kaa jaadu khatm hone laga tha, us daur main bhi unka sangeet lokapriy hote rahaa

 BJP is going to try its luck on the Legislative Council seats to be elected by teachers
 soobe main jeet kaa silsilaa barkaraar rakhane ke liye ne sabhi siton par sahaayta praapt or vittvihin shikshak sanghon ko todane kii ranneeti banaai he
 BJP can declare its candidates for all 11 Legislative Council seats in the first week of September
 bijepi ne shikshak evam snaatak kshetra ke ummidavaaron ko bhi prachaar ke liye paryaapt samay dene kii yojana banaai he
 Explain that the BJP government with more than two-thirds majority in the assembly is in the minority in the Legislative Council
 aise main bijepi ne vidhaan parishad main bhi apni sadsy sankhya badhaane ke liye shikshak evam snaatak kshetra kii siton par najar gada di he
 For this, the BJP has decided to field candidates for all 11 Legislative Council seats, for which screening has started
 shikshak sanghon ke sambhavit ummidavaar bijepi se tikat paane ke jugad main hai
 If you consider Dinesh Sharma and Ashok Kataria as responsible sources, then the Deputy Chief Minister Dr
 Behind the scenes command of the Legislative Council elections in the field of graduates and teachers
 dinesh sharma dekh rahe hai
 Sharma is also the Leader of the House in the Legislative Council
 pradesh ke sahaayta praapt or vittvihin shikshak sanghon ko bijepi ke paale main laane kii jimmedaari unheen ke kandhon par he
 Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma said that BJP has decided to contest the Legislative Council of Teachers Union for the first time
 jabaki snaatak kaa chunaav ham ladate rahe hai
 The BJP will contest MLC with all its efforts and strength
 ham zyada se zyada siten jeetne ke liye jor lagaayenge
 The BJP has entrusted the responsibility of adding the names of maximum number of teachers and graduates in the voter list to the district presidents and district in-charge of all 11 seats
 bijepi ke pradesh mahaamantri or parishad chunaav ke prabharee ashok kataaria ne chunavi baithken kar sthaneey sameekaran ke hisaab se ranneeti banani shuru kar di he
 Increased tension of teachers' unions Umesh Dwivedi of LMSL Aajtak
 in se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki bijepi or congress donon rashtriya partiyaan abhi tak shikshak sangh ke emelsi chunaav nahin ladati rahi hai
 This is the first time that the BJP is going to field its candidates in the election fray
 bijepi agar sabhi 11 siten bhi jeet jaati he to bhi vidhaan parishad main bahumat kaa aankada nahin chhu paaegi
 Umesh Dwivedi said that teachers should not divide politics among parties
 bijepi ke chunavi maidan main utarane se logon ke man main vipareet asar padegaa or vidhyalay kaa maahaul bhi kharaab hoga
 In such a situation, the way national parties were far away from them, they should stay away
 ye he rajya kii vidhaan parishad siton kaa ganitabta den ki uttar pradesh kii kul 100 vidhaan parishad siten hai
 Of these, BJP has only 21 members
 jabaki sapa ke paas 55 sadsy hai or basapa ke paas 8 vidhaan parishad sadsy hai
 Apart from this, Congress has two members, out of which one member Dinesh Pratap Singh has joined BJP
 inke alaava 5 sadsy snaatakon ke dwaara chune jate hai or 6 sadsy shikshak sangh ke dwaara chunakar aate hai
 The tenure of 11 members of the Legislative Council of Graduates and Teachers in Uttar Pradesh is being completed in May 2020
 aise main march-april main in 11 siton par chunaav hone hai
 The areas of these members consist of several districts and several divisions
 isiilie bijepi pehle se apane ummidavaar ko utarkar unhen chunaav prachaar ke liye paryaapt samay dena chaahati he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen how the BJP performs in the Legislative Council elections in the field of graduates and teachers
 US President Donald Trump has once again criticized India and China on the climate issue
 trump ne kaha ki bharat, china or rus main shuddh hawa or pani tak nahin he or ye desh vishwa ke paryaavaran ke prati apni jimmedaari nahin nibhaa rahe hai
 However, Trump himself, who has taught India on the environment, has a tainted past
 unhone kai aise kadam uthaae hai, jinase paryaavaran bachaane ke abhiyaanon ko nuksaan pahunchaa he
 On the other hand, India has always said that it is committed to its target on carbon emissions
 bharat kaa aagrah yah he ki viksit desh hi tapamanavardhak gaison ke liye sabase zyada jimmedaar rahe hai, isliye unke dushprabhavon se ladane main unhen hi sabase zyada jimmedaari leni padegi
 During the agreement on climate in Paris, India's request was accepted that the developed countries were the most responsible for the temperature-increasing gases, so they would have to take the most responsibility in fighting their side effects
 1
 Withdrawing from Paris Accord: In June 2017, US President Donald Trump announced his exit from the 196 parties to the Paris Climate Agreement
 trump ne 2016 main raashtrapati chunaav ke prachaar ke dauraan isaki ghoshnaa kii thi
 With this decision, the US broke away from international efforts to combat global warming
 isse paryaavaran sangrakshan ke vaishvik prayaason ko jhatka laga or isaki bade paimaane par aalochana hui
 2
 clin power par obama kii niti ko waapas liyaclin power plan america ke purv raashtrapati baraak obama kii ek pramukh yojana thi
 Under this, the energy sector was to cut carbon emissions by 32 percent by the year 2030
 lekin oktober 2017 main trump prashasan ne ise waapas le liya
 It was said that this is putting unnecessary burden on the power sector
 3
 Relaxation in rules on toxic air pollution: There was a rule about pollution in America - once in, always in or OIAI
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki yadi koi company kanoonee rup se maanya seemaa se zyada vaayu pradooshan karti he to use apane samakaksh udyog main sabase kam pradooshan karne vaale company kii barabari kerani hogi
 It was a rule meant to punish companies
 lekin OIAI niyam main badlaav kar ise lacheela bana diya gaya
 Significantly, after a struggle that lasted for more than two decades, Paris became the only country in the world and everyone's responsibility was fixed for the prevention of climate change
 sabhi deshon ne mana ki ausat vaishvik taapmaana main badhotaree ko kisi bhi haalat main do degree celsius se aage nahin jane dena he
 Rather try that figure 1
 5 degree tak hi rahe
 For this, a blueprint for greenhouse and other gases emissions reduction was prepared
 bharat kaa saaf he rukhpradhanmantri narendra modi ne paris sammelan kii shuruyaat main apane bhaashan main hi kah diya tha ki 'jalwaayu se jude nyaay kaa takaaza he ki carbon utsarjan ke liye ab jo thodi-si jagah rah gai he, usamen vikasshil deshon ko apane vikaas kii paryaapt gunjaaish mili
 For this reason, India kept its position sufficiently tight during the Paris Conference negotiations
 bharat ne saaf kar diya ki viksit desh aarthik sahaayta or aadhunik takanic dene main jitani udaartaa kaa parichay denge, vah bhi tapamanavardhak gaison ke utsarjan main katautee ke prashn par utani hi dur tak jane ke liye taiyaar rahegaa
 India may have become the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world due to its large population, but its per capita emissions (1
 9 ton prativarsh) america ke dasven hisse ke baraabar hi he
 The per capita consumption of electricity is equal to 1000 units, while in the US it is equal to 13000 units
 bharat ne paris sammelan ko di gai apni svaichhik katautee ghoshnaa main kaha he ki vah 2030 tak apni 40 pratishat bijli gaiyr baio-ful sroton se paidaa karegaa

 Being an agricultural country, the Indian economy depends to a large extent on the monsoon
 achche monsoon kii ummid aam kisaan se lekar sarkaar tak ko rahati he
 Monsoon in India is likely to be delayed this time
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik kerala main monsoon 6 june ko pahonchega
 This time the monsoon is knocking 5 days later than normal in India
 isse pehle mausam purvanumaan lagane vaali privet agency skymet ne jaankaree di thi ki monsoon is baar 4 june tak dastak de saktaa he
 Normally in Kerala, the onset of monsoon is June 1
 haalanki agency kii ore se is baar barish ko lekar sambhaavnaaen jataai gai hai ki monsoon main barish 'saamaanya se kam' rah sakati he
 At the same time, the possibility of the monsoon speed is also not being comfortable, because it is believed that its progress will not go smoothly in the whole of India

 On the other hand, in central India, LPA is expected to rain up to 91 percent
 vidarbha, marathavada, pashchim madhya pradesh or gujarat main barish saamaanya se bahut kam rahegi
 However, this may worsen the situation further as many parts of Marathwada and Gujarat are facing drought like conditions
 vahiin skymet ne ashanka jataai he ki karnataka ke uttari andruni hisse or roilseema main kharaab barish ho sakati he
 Kerala and coastal Karnataka are expected to receive better rains

 The last two rounds of voting remain
 12 may ko desh kii rajdhani dilli kii sabhi saat siton par voting hogi
 Before the voting, a verbal war is going on between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 is bich aapattijanak parche bantwane ke baad aap ne gambhir par ek or aarope lagaaya he
 Sharing a photo, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister and senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia has claimed that, Gambhir was sitting in an AC car at his roadshow, while the public was garlanding him as a serious person
 gautam gambhir ke is hamshakl kaa naam gaurav aroda or ise congress kaa netaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 Sisodia tweeted and wrote that, this is the great revolution of Congress and BJP

 And the duplicate is actually a Congress leader
 https: / / t
 co / bt0k0qyvsg — Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) May 10, 2019 In fact, Manish Sisodia wrote this while retweeting the tweet of a man named Durgesh Pathak
 durgesh pathak ne apane twit main likhaa ki gautam gambhir kaa dupliket gaurav aroda he, jo ki congress kaa 2017 MCD chunaav kaa ward 96N se ummidavaar tha
 So the question is why Congress and Ajay Maken want to help BJP? What's the deal? Durgesh has also shared a photo of Gaurav Arora with former Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken
 iske alaava uskaa congress party kaa vijating card bhi share kiya he
 Earlier on Thursday, AAP candidate from East Delhi accused Gambhir of distributing a form containing objectionable and derogatory remarks against him
