 Terrorism is terrorism
 uskaa hindu musalmaan yaa koi jati-panth or dharm nahin hota
 Strongly opposing these allegations of Rajnath Singh, opposition members including the Congress alleged that the government was politicizing terrorism
 grih mantri ne kaha ki aatankwaad desh ke liye sabase badi chunauti he or is mudde par na to sansad ko or na hi desh ko vibhajit dikhnaa chahie
 He said that he is ready to discuss and respond to the issue

 He said that any attempt by the enemies of the country to undermine the unity and integrity of India and the security of the citizens of the country will be given a quick and befitting reply from our security forces
 sarkaar aatankwaad se dridhtaa or kadai se nibatane ke liye patibaddh he or seemaa paar se chalaayi ja rahi sabhi aatankwaadi gatividhiyon ko rokane ke liye har sambhav prayaas karegi

 aap netaa arvind kejariwal ke maardarshak or purv saathi anna hajaare ne aaj tak ke vishesh samvaadadaata pankaj khelkar ko bataaya ki aakhir aap vifal kyon rahi or kya vah ek prabhavi vipakshi dal party ban sakati he
 According to you, what was Arvind Kejriwal's biggest mistake: to get into politics, to leave the post of Chief Minister or to jump to the national level election on such a big scale? Kejriwal's biggest mistake was to leave the post of Chief Minister of Delhi and Lok Sabha on such a large scale To contest elections
 kejariwal or main varshon tak saath kaam kar chuke hai
 When he expressed his desire to form a political party, it was only then that i warned him that we should take the path of struggle, but he did not listen to me
 hamaara itihaas bataata he ki hamaare desh main vaastavik safalataa sangharsh se milti he, lekin kejariwal party banane ke liye ade the
 When he got huge success in the first year itself, he thought, "now i can become the Prime Minister of this country
 ’’ yah unki sabase badi vifaltaa thi
 Did Arvind try to meet you in the last few months? i met him once when he was the Chief Minister of Delhi
 maine unase kaha, ‘‘puure desh kii chintaa mat karo, apana dhyaan dilli par lagaao,’’ lekin unhone meri baat nahin suni or loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladaa is haar ke baad ve na to mujhase mili hai or na hi unhone sampark kiya he
 They are walking as they wish
 meraa unase koi sampark nahin he
 How do you see the current conflict going on within you? Is this a real democratic struggle or is the party disintegrating? If some people dominate you like this, then i can say that its worst time will come
 aapako desh kii seva karne ke liye dimag main seva ke bhav ko hi kuta-kootakar bharna hoga
 If the greed for political power comes to mind then the image of the party in the society will deteriorate further
 farvari, 2014 main aapane kejariwal ko satta kaa bhookha bataaya tha
 Do you still believe so? Yes, if Kejriwal continues to fight for political power, the rest of the people of this country will also feel that they are greedy for power and whatever they are doing, tax for their personal interests
 Have been
 bataur party aap kaa vajood rahegaa?meraa rasta sahi tha
 i still believe that Arvind should not have started the party
 acchhee baat yah he ki unki chhavi ab bhi saaf-suthri he
 He has worked for the society for many years and this is why he has achieved so much in such a short time
 main nahin samajhataa ki aap khatm ho chuki he
 At times Nadani gets mistaken and Arvind confesses his mistakes
 apane puraane shishy ko kya salaah denge?ab ve mere paas nahin aaenge kyonki hamaare vichaar alag-alag hai, agar ve aisa karte hai to main swaagat hi karuunga kyonki ve samaaj kii bhalaai ke liye sochate hai
 i would like to advise AAP workers to remain united, work for the party and use their party's election symbol broom to eradicate evils from society
 aap kaa bhavishya kya he?yah ek behtareen vipakshi dal ban saktaa he
 If the ruling party makes a mistake, they should strongly oppose it
 sirf arvind kii party hi aisa kar sakati he

 In view of the possibility of black money being deposited in Jan Dhan accounts during demonetisation, the central government had stopped the withdrawal of more than 5 thousand amount from the accounts every month
 iske vipareet chhattisgarh main ek saptaah ke bheetar hi jandhan khaaton main 45 karod se zyada raashi nikaali gai he
 This makes it clear that the banks have not followed the instructions
 dilachasp baat yah he ki ek maah ke bheetar jiro balance vaale khaaton main kaaphi kami aa gai thi lekin pichley hafte inaki sankhya 1 lakh 14 hajaar kii vruddhi darj kii gai
 The number of Jan Dhan accounts within Chhattisgarh as on 14 December was 1 crore 11 lakh 46 thousand 986
 pichley saptaah in khaaton kii sankhya badhkar 1 karod 11 lakh 57 hajaar se adhik ho gai
 That means 10 thousand 6 hundred new Jan Dhan accounts opened during this period
 haalankijandhan khatonmen jamaa raashi main 14 disambar se 21 disambar ke bich ghatat dekhi gai
 On the 14th, the information of depositing Rs 1571 crore in the accounts was given on the website, but within the next 7 days the amount was reduced to Rs 1526 crore
 yani ek hapte ke bheetar khaaton se 45 karod nikaale gaye
 Prior to this, funds have been continuously increasing in Jan Dhan accounts
 gauratlab he ki jandhan khaaton main jamaa or nikasi donon kii nigaraanee iskar vibhaag or rajya sarkaar kii ore se kii ja rahi he
 Any irregularities of any kind occurring in it will be revealed in the coming time
 jandhan khataadharakon ko aadhaar se jodne or rupye card jari karne ke aankade jarur bade hai
 Along with this, the number of accounts with zero balance has also increased due to large scale withdrawal of deposits
 14 disambar kii taarikh par rajya main jiro balance vaale khaaton kii sankhya ghatakar 37 lakh 55 hajaar ho gai thi
 Which again increased to 38,61,952 last week
 yani ek hafte main jiro balance vaale ek lakh chauwalis hajaar khate bad gaye jabaki is dauraan sirf 10 hajaar hi nae khate khule
 Regarding the decrease of 7 lakh 92 thousand in the number of Jan Dhan accounts in the state from 7 to 14 December, bank experts say that there is a provision to convert Jan Dhan accounts into normal accounts by taking KYC forms
 lekin notebandi ke dauraan ek hapte main hi lagbhag 8 lakh khaaton kosamanya khatonmen badalane kaa maamla sandehon ko janm de rahaa he
 That is when the Central Government and the Reserve Bank have stopped the withdrawal of more than 5 thousand every month from Jan Dhan accounts
 rajya main jo lakh jandhan khate kam hue he unamem kareeb 276 karod rupee jamaa the
 If these accounts have been converted into normal accounts, then the withdrawal of the amount will be removed from them
 is baat par sarkaar or iskar vibhaag ko jaanch kerani chahie

 Four mlas and a minister are with them, i will tell when the time comes
 vidhayakon ko bulaakar kehete hai mujhe sanyojak banaao, nahin banaao to phir bijepi main chalo
 i am talking about saving the party
 party ke hit main baat kar rahaa hum
 Today i resigned, what decision did Mr
 Sahib take
 unhone bhi baahar bahut sari baaten boleen
 i regretted it
 jo saathi party ke baahar bol rahe hai kya vah khet prakat karenge
 Did they express regret party kamjor karne kii sajeesh he
 Only four or five mlas who are speaking with them are being misled
 galat tareeke se un vidhayakon kaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 i want to ask him that when he was facing fake cases Bassi Saheb was the Police Commissioner of Delhi, the workers were being sent to jail, then he called Bassi Saheb on his birthday
 is baat se arvind ji bhi nahin pahunche the
 He has a deep relationship with him only then he came on his birthday party
 "apane man kii baat baahar nikaalte hughamantullane kaha, "maine piesi ke andar apni sari baaten rakhin
 He goes outside the PAC and talks outside, whether it is EVM or other issues
 vah punjab chunaav ladaane nahin gaye, nigam chunaav main unhone prachaar nahin kiya
 The party was harmed by these things
 vah baahar party netritv par bayaanbaji kar rahe hai
 He was also present during the ticket distribution
 unki baat har jagah suni jaati he phir baahar aakar vah baat kyon karte hai
 They are doing so at the behest of Congress and BJP
 aaj yah baat main kah rahaa hum kal sab log maanenge
 i resign
 galat baat unhone bhi kii hai party ko nuksaan unase bhi hua he to vah apana stand bataaen ki kya he
 " aap kisi aise shaks ke saath bhi pyaar main pad ja sakate hai, jo dil se to behad pyaara or paak-saaf hota he, lekin unke saath ek choti-si nahin, asal main bahut badi samasya hoti he
 The name of this big problem is 'arrogance'
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki aapaki arranjamerijhui ho or shaadi ke baad aapane anubhav kiya ho ki unke bheetar ahankaar naam kaa keedaa ghar kiye baitha he
 If this is the case, don't worry too much
 har samasya kii tarah is samasya kaa bhi hal he
 We tell you what that solution is
 agar aap chaahati hai ki unke bheetar ghar kiye baithkehankaarka keedaa hameshaa ke liye khatm ho jaae, to aapako kerani hogi thodi mashkkat
 First of all, do not forget to praise them on every small and big success
 ve koi bhi kaam karen, aap unki tarif karen, lekin ek daayre main rahakar
 Make them realize that they are really a good husband and person
 jab kabhi wo bahes karne lagen, to turant unki tarif ke pul baandhne shuru kar den
 Tell them that they are expert in debate
 tarif karte hue un par dabaav banaaen ki ve khud hi bol uthen ki unhen kuch nahin pataa or ve zyada samajhadaar nahin hai
 This will open up their thoughts and sweeten your relationship
 jaraa-si marketing ho jaae, to aapke rishte main alag hi rang aayega
 Marketing means that the way marketing savvy makes people realize how beneficial a product is to them without much praise to the person in front of them, in the same way you also make them realize that they are for you Are so special
 bas, ho jayega aapaki samasyaon kaa samaadhaan
 The problems of the central government in the Rajya Sabha are not being named
 
 
 pehle sadhvi niranjan jyoti ke bayaan par bavaal hota rahaa or ab mahant adityanath ke dharm parivartan ke maamle par gatirodh bana hua he
 
 
 If the matter is about Uttar Pradesh, then Mayawati and Samajwadi Party also become one
 
 
 congress, trinmul congress, samaajawaadee party, bispi or left ne yah tay kiya he ki jab tak pradhanmantri rajyasabha main aakar yah aashwaasan na de den ki is tarah se dharmaparivartan nahin kiya jayega, tab tak rajyasabha ko nahin chalane diya jayega
 The government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 
 
 isi vajah se kisi bhi mudde par vipaksh sarkaar ko gher letaa he
 
 
 Secondly, the effect of severely damaged relations between BJP and Trinamool Congress can also be seen in the proceedings of Rajya Sabha
 
 
 trinmul congress ke 12 rajyasabha sadsy hai, jinamein se do sharada chitfund ghotaale main jail main hai
 
 
 Out of the remaining 10, Derek o'brien alone gets the Rajya Sabha adjourned, and if the issue is related to communalism, then the entire opposition yells yes
 
 
 sankhya kii isi vajah se jahaan sarkaar loksabhaa main maje kar rahi he, vahiin rajyasabha main use alag ranneeti banani pad rahi he
 
 
 It has to depend entirely on Congress for many important bills
 
 
 congress bhi in badale halaat kaa phayda uthaa rahi he
 
 
 The Congress used to plead with the BJP to pass the bills in its government, now it is opposing those same bills itself
 
 
 yahi vajah he ki insurance bill atka hua he, haalanki bijepi ne congress ko pata liya he or ab uske 50 se adhik sanshodhano ko paas karne ke liye raji ho gai he
 
 
 But this cannot be done with all bills
 
 
 doosraa vikalp he, sansad kaa jwanit seshan, yani loksabhaa or rajyasabha kaa sanyukt satr bulaayaa jaae, tab sankhya sarkaar ke paksh main ho jaati he
 
 
 But how many bills will this be done for? 
 
 baar-baar jwanit seshan bulaane se sarkaar kii kirakiri bhi hogi
 
 
 And this condition of the government will remain till the monsoon session next year, because then the government will have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 
 
 bhartiya janata party kaa saath chhod congress main aae shatrughna sinha bihar ke patna sahib se loksabhaa pratyaashee hai
 His wife Poonam Sinha is contesting from the Samajwadi Party (SP) from Lucknow parliamentary seat
 patni punam sinha ke namakan ke dauraan shatrughna sinha kaa lakhanu main unke saath rahanaa congress ke netaaon ko raas nahin aayaa
 Local party leaders were concerned about how Shatrughan, a Congress leader, could be involved in the nomination and road show of the SP candidate
 lakhanu se hi congress pratyaashee acharya pramod krishnam ne sabase pehle unke lakhanu daure par aapatti jataai thi
 He had said that Shatrughan Sinha has followed husband religion and now follow party religion and campaign for me one day too
 acharya pramod ko yah nagavar gujara ki congress main shaamil hue shatrughna sapa or akhilesh ke liye kyon chunaav prachaar kar rahe hai jabaki uttar pradesh main sapa or congress party kaa gathbandhan bhi nahin he
 Shatrughan Sinha has offered his clarification on this statement of Acharya Pramod Krishnam
 shatrughna sinha ne kaha, 'acharya pramod krishna ne jo kaha he main uski kadra karata hum
 As far as Lucknow is concerned, it was a special case
 main ramayana kii parampara ke mutabik apni patni kaa saath nibhaa rahaa tha
 All the people who worked in Congress for going to Lucknow knew this
 'shatrughna sinha ne ajtak se hui khaas baatcheet main kaha ki '2014 kii tarah 2019 main modi lahar nahin he
 The Modi wave has created havoc for the youth
 yah ladaai adharm or dharm ke bich kii he
 During the nomination and road show of wife Poonam Sinha, Shatrughan Sinha even told Akhilesh Yadav even as prime ministerial candidate
 is dauraan unhone media se khulkar baatcheet bhi kii thi
 However, Shatrughan Sinha has already said on the promotion of his wife that he is campaigning only after getting the consent of the Congress
 isse pehle aisa kaha ja rahaa tha ki punam sinha congress main shaamil hone vaali hai lekakin in atakalon par tab viraam lag gaya jab unhone samaajawaadee party kaa haath tham liya
 Voting will be held on May 6 in Lucknow
 philhal lakhanu sansadeey seat se grih mantri rajnath singh saansad hai
 This time the contest is between SP-BSP alliance candidate Poonam Sinha and Rajnath Singh

 But Governor Romney does not have a five-point plan
 unke paas keval ek sutri yojana he
 And that plan is to make sure that there are different rules for the top people
 obama ne kaha, nijee kshetra main yah unka darshan rahaa he
 This has been his philosophy as governor

 The Chairman of the debate on this, Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, intervened and said that both men were right in their place

 us samay bahes dekhne vaale 67 pratishat logon ne romany ke pradarshan ko acha bataaya tha, jabaki 25 pratishat ne obama kaa saath diya tha
 But how much Obama's aggressive performance benefits him remains to be seen, as in most media reports, the White House race is either being equaled or it is being said that Obama can lose the election

 white house kii jeet pakki karne ke liye 270 voton kii jarurat he
 However, in the second match, Obama ridiculed Romney's five-point economic plan, saying Governor Romney says he has a five-point plan
 lekin governor romany ke paas paanch sutri yojana nahin he
 They have only one point plan
 or vah yojana yah sunishchit karaane kii he ki sheersh logon ke liye alag tarah ke niyam hon

 Romney said, this election is about these policies
 unhone kaha ki obama madhyavargeey vikaas ko praathamikta denge
 Romney said, his policies are about how we can create a bright and prosperous future for the middle class of this country

 jab obama ne kaha ki agle hi din unhone ise ek aatankwaadi hamalaa bataaya tha, to romany ne is par chunauti de di
 In response, Obama said that the script of the statement can be seen for this

 He said that Obama will give priority to middle class development
 romany ne kaha, unki nitiyaan is bare main hai ki ham is desh ke madhya varg kaa kaise ujwal va samrudh bhavishya bana sakate hai

 ) After marriage, two completely unknown people become one
 unke saath hi unke parivaar vaale bhi ek bandhan se jud jate hai
 While family members always work together to give strength, husbands and wives try to run this relationship wisely
 is dauraan kai baar aisi sthiti bhi saamne aati he jab ye lagata he ki ab sabakuch bikharane vaala he or rishta tut jayega
 But in these weak moments, not leaving each other together is the foundation of this relationship
 ek-duusare par bharosa, prem or samaj pati-patni ke rishte ke liye behad jaruri he
 Both should share everything and everything with each other
 par is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki kuch aisi bhi baaten hoti hai jinhen kisi ke saath saajha nahin karnaa chahie
 Wives tell almost everything from husbands, but here is a mention of some similar things that should not be forgotten and told by husband: 1
 apane purv premi or prem ke bare membhale hi shaadi se pehle aap kisi ladke se pyaar karti rahi hon lekin shaadi ke baad use bhul janaa hi aapke hit main hoga
 Even if you feel that your husband is open-minded and this will not affect them, but tell you that it is not necessary to be like this
 ho saktaa he ki kabhi ladaai hone par wo aapako aapke purv premi kaa naam lekar taana de de
 This situation will not be perfect at all
 2
 Financial status This applies especially to women who are working
 aapke liye ye bahut jaruri he ki aapaki personal or profeshnal life alag-alag ho
 It is not necessary that you should share every detail of your account with your husband
 wo chaahe ji-mail acount ho yaa phir bank-acount
 3
 chugali na karkisi bhi ladke ko apane parivaar waalon ke bare main sunanaa acha nahin lagata he
 In such a situation, if you feel bad about any member of his family, then try to solve him with a cold head
 apane pati se shikaayat karne pahunch janaa acha nahin rahegaa
 Maybe he will listen to you for some time but gradually he will start getting irritated by it
 4
 Do not forget about your husband, even if you mention these to your friends, but they will not like it so much that you give a lot of attention to their friends

 yah 2019 ke aam chunaav se pehle modi sarkaar kaa antim purna bajet he, isliye logon ko kaaphi ummid he ki yah loklubhaavan bajet ho saktaa he
 Especially the working class hopes that the Finance Minister can make some relief announcements for them
 aaie jaanate hai ki kya hai naukareepesha varg kii ummiden or arun jetali ke brifces se is varg ke liye kya achche sarprise nikal sakate hai
 Benefit of deduction under section 80C to the maximum of 1 taxable income by investing in EPF, PPF, Life Insurance, NSC etc
 to the individual taxpayer at present
 5 lakh rupee tak kii katautee hasil karne kaa adhikaar he
 People hope that this time the Finance Minister can increase it by up to Rs 50,000
 section 80si ke tahat nivesh karke katautee laabh hasil karne kii seemaa yadi 2 lakh rupee tak kar di gai, to karadaataaon ke tex bracket ke hisaab se har saal 2,575 rupee se 15,000 rupee tak kii bachat ho sakati he
 According to an estimate, the loss of Rs 2,575 crores annually in terms of the state exchequer
 tex yogya aay kii seemaa badhanakhaskar vetanbhogi karadaata kaaphi samay se texable inakam kii seemaa ko badhaane kii ummid kar rahe hai
 It was also discussed in the last budget that this limit can be increased to Rs 3 lakh, but the Finance Minister did not do so
 is baar agar vitt mantri ne kar yogya aay seemaa ko 2
 From 5 lakhs to 3 lakhs of rupees, people can get relief
 ek anumaan ke anusaar aisa karne par 75 lakh karadaataaon ko phayda milane kii ummid he
 This may reduce the tax treasury of the government by Rs 5,300 crore
 standard didction kii phir se shuruyatkardaataaon or udyog jagat kii taraf se kai saal se yah maang bhi aa rahi he ki pehle prachlit rahe standard didction kii vyavastha ko phir se shuru kiya jaae
 Under this, all types of taxpayers get the benefit of deduction equal to the lump sum amount
 abhi vetanbhogi karmchaariyon ko kanvence alouns or medical reimbersment ke badale kar yogya aay main katautee kaa laabh miltaa he, jabaki kaarobaariyon ko apane kaarobaar main hue vibhinn tarah ke kharchon ke badale katautee kaa laabh miltaa he
 The system was first implemented in the year 1974, but in the 2006–07 budget, then Finance Minister P
P
 chidabanram ne ise khatm kar diya
 Industry Chamber Assocham says that if it is restarted, it will increase demand and promote economic growth
 maan lijie ki sarkaar vetanbhogi varg ke liye ekasmaan 50,000 rupee kaa didction tay kar detii he to isse karadaatao kii jeb main 2,575 se 15,300 rupee tak kii salanaa atirikt rakam aa sakati he
 Tax slabs and changes in rates The industry is constantly demanding this
 philhal 2
 10 per cent on annual income from 5 lakh to 5 lakh, 20 percent on income above 5 lakh and up to 10 lakh and 30 percent on income above 10 lakh is taxed
 naukareepesha varg ko ummid he ki vitt mantri is bajet main 10 lakh se 20 lakh tak kaa ek nayaa bracket tay karenge, kyonki haal ke varshon menaiti jaisekai sector main logon kii selary kaaphi badi he or unki aay kaa kaaphi bada hissaa tex main chalaa jaataa he
 So if suppose that the finance minister fixes a tax rate of 10 per cent for income from 5 to 10 lakh and 20 per cent for income group of 10 to 20 lakh, then the tax liability of people with income of 5 to 10 lakh will be halved and Those with income between 10 to 20 lakhs will also save a lot

 'besides, the minimum limit of Rs 10 lakh would mean that any dealer, whose daily turnover is Rs 2,800, would come under the purview of GST

 However, the Empowered Committee is in favor of keeping the minimum limit at a lower level, so that establishments doing business of Rs 10 lakh per annum come under the purview of GST

 The Sangh said this while commenting on the alleged statement of Law Minister Salman Khurshid about Sonia Gandhi's tears after seeing the pictures of Butla House Muthabhed
 khurshid ke is daawey par sangh ke mukhpatr panchajnya ke sampadakeey main tippanee karte hue kaha gaya he, ‘kanoon mantri ne azamgarh kii ek sabha main sonia gandhi ke aansuon kaa sahaara lete hue kaha he ki batla house cond kii tasviren dekhakar sonia ro padi thim
 That is, Sonia Gandhi's condolences to the Muslim youths killed in the encounter broke out
 ’sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘congress prakarantar se chunaav main muslim matadaataaon se sonia gandhi ke aansuon kii keemat vot ke rup main vasuulana chaahati he
 'it has been claimed, the Congress knows that its religious reservation leaf has been beaten in Uttar Pradesh and many Muslims are considering this effort as divisive
 aise main party netaa baichaiyn hai ki musalamaanon ko bargalane ke liye or kya tareeke apanaae jaaen
 The Sangh has said, "the Batla House scandal is just a tool for the Congress to manipulate the Muslim vote, which they start cheating whenever they get out, but the Muslims are not so innocent that they don't understand their tricks

 According to army sources, the ban has been in place for almost a year
 aise agar kisi adhikari ko golf khelnaa ho to vah srinagar main governor house main bhugtan karke khel saktaa he
 Actually, General Bipin Rawat, the Chief of Army Staff was on a tour of Jammu and Kashmir some time back 
 15 kor ke headquarter badami baag main suraksha kii ek ahm baithak le rahe the
 That day, he noticed that the bodies of some of the jawans who were killed during the operation in Kashmir were reaching the 15 Corps headquarters and even during this time some army senior officers were busy playing golf
 aise main sena pramukh ne faisla liya ki jab zyaadaatar adhikari or jawan aatankwaad ke khilaaf oparation main lage hue hai
 In such a situation, it is not right for some officials to play golf
 aise main pichley 1 saal se 15 kor main golf khilne par roak lagi hui he
 After the terrorist attack in Darsal, Uri, the then Chief of Army Staff, General Dalbir Suhag, had also stopped playing golf in Kashmir, but at that time this decision was only applicable in the entire brigade
 haalanki yah faisla puri kashmir ghati ke liye tha
 According to sources, there are some officials of this decision but most of the officers and jawans are in favor of the decision

 Even after the hearing in the Supreme Court on the petition of the Congress on midnight on Wednesday, even though the court has refused to stop the swearing in of Yeddyurappa, the court did not appear satisfied with the arguments made by the BJP
 buudhvaar kii shaam karnataka ke rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa bheja to congress is maamle ko lekar buudhvaar raat main hi supreme court pahunch gai
 There was an all night debate between the Congress lawyer and the government lawyers
 teen jajon kii bench ne raatbhar donon pakshon ko suna or phir din kaa suraj nikalne ke pehle aadesh diya ki philhal yediurppa kaa shapath samaaroh hoga
 The case was heard by a bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan, Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri and Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde
 adishnal solicytor general tushaar mehta or atorni general keke venugopal ne centre sarkaar kaa paksh rakhaa
 Former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi favored BJP and Abhishek Manu Singhvi appeared on behalf of Congress
 jaaniye, is dauraan kya tark-vitark hue-dal-badal kanoon par hui bahessupreme court main centre sarkaar ke vakil ne tark diya ki dal-badal virdohi kanoon (anti defections lau) karnataka ke navnirvaachit vidhayakon ke upar lagu nahin hota he kyonki abhi tak unhone shapath nahin lee he
 Terming the government's argument as "rubbish", the court said, "it means open invitation to horse trading"
 'goa pahunchi karnataka kii jang, congress boli- yahaan bhi sabase badi party ko bulaaen governorcongress-jedies kii taraf se pairvi kar rahe abhishek manu singhvi ne supreme court ke saamne yah tark rakhaa ki bijepi tab tak bahumat kaa daawa nahin kar sakati he jab tak ki yah vidhayakon ko dal-badal ke liye protsaahit naa karen
 On this, the court said that this aspect will be looked into under the Anti Defection Law (dal-badal Law)
 centre sarkaar ke varisht kanoon adhikari keke venugopal ne kaha ki jaruri nahin ki aisa hi maamla bane
 Party change will happen when one member moves to another party
 jab tak nirvaachit sadsy vidhayak pad kii shapath nahin le lete hai, tab tak un par dal-badal kanoon lagu nahin hota he
 "can legislators change parties before swearing in?" The Supreme Court refused to ban Yeddyurappa's swearing-in but was not completely satisfied with the argument
 court ne centre kii daleel sunne ke baad sawaal kiya, 'to kya aapkaa matlab he ki shapath grahan se pehle vidhayak dal-badal kar sakate hai?' court ne bijepi ke 112 ke bahumat ke aankade tak pahunchane ke tareeke par hairaani jataai
 Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued, 'governors cannot deny democracy
 
 
 
 There are 104 members on one side and 116 on the other side
 
 
 yah bahut hi kaaman sens kii baat he ki koun si sankhya badi he
 The court wondered if the congress-jds coalition had a strength of 116, then how did BS Yeddyurappa claim the support of more than half of the mlas? The court said that they have not seen the letter of support of the mlas entrusted to the governor but the basis for calling Yeddyurappa does not fit according to the current mathematics
 mukul rohtagi ne tark diya ki agar kisi ko shapath dilaa di gai to aasmaan nahin tut padegaa
 The last time the case was heard in the court at midnight, the case related to hanging Yakub Memon
 venugopal or mukul rohtagi ne supreme court se congress kii yachika ko khaarij karne kii apil ke saath kaha ki court ko rajyapal ke faisle par roak nahin lagaani chahie
 'karnataka case is different from Goa' Rohatgi also said that the case of Karnataka is completely different from Goa
 goa main congress sabase badi party ke taur par ubhari thi lekin bijepi or iske sahyogiyon ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit kar diya gaya tha
 Rohatgi said Goa Governor Mridula Sinha had invited Manohar Parrikar to the BJP as the Congress had not submitted a claim
 aapako bataa den ki jedies or congress ne rajyapal ko 117 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa patr saunpa tha
 It has signatures of 78 Congress, 37 JDS, one BSP and one Independent MLA
 aapako bataa den ki karnataka main 222 siton par matdaan hua tha, is hisaab se bahumat ke liye 112 vidhayakon kaa samarthan hi chahie
 Whereas BJP has only 104 mlas
 haalanki bijepi congress-jedies (jiske paas 116 vidhayak hai) se pehla round to jeet chuki he

 dilli vidhansabha main siem arvind kejariwal buudhvaar ko alji or centre kii bijepi sarkaar par khub barase
 Kejriwal, while discussing the bill brought to regularize guest teachers in the assembly, said, "we are the owners of Delhi and not the bureaucrat
" unke is bayaan kaa aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ne mej thapthapaakar swaagat kiya
 During his speech, angry Kejriwal said that the people of Delhi have not chosen Law Secretary, but have chosen him as CM
 isliye sarkaar kya or kaise karegi, iskaa faisla unako karne kaa adhikaar he
 Kejriwal said, 'they say CM or Deputy CM will not show the file
 aisa kya chupa rakhaa he filon main? ham kya aatankwaadi nazar aate hai alji ko
 i am an elected CM, not a terrorist
 'afasaron ke peeche chhupakar na karen raajnneetikejariwal ne kaha, 'bill ke andar kamiyaan hai to ham raat bhar baithne ko taiyaar hai
 The officers are not working according to us
 inhen alji se phone aata he
 You do politics by hiding behind the officers, come and do politics
 kejariwal alji anil baijal ke us faisle se naaraaz hai, jisamen unhone dilli sarkaar ko guest teachers kaa bill vidhansabha main pesh karne se pehle usamen sudhaar karne kii baat kahi thi
 Let us tell you what else Kejriwal said during his speech in the Vidhan Sabha: - The issue of guest teachers is very important, teachers should be given respect and security and not to be stuck in it - this issue should be kept away from politics- General If the man party and BJP meet then they will be confirmed in a week - a mutual agreement
 vijendra guptaji aapse haath jod kar nivedan he ye bataaie guest teachers kaa kaam karnaa he ki nahin karnaa- alji sahab kaa sarvice vaala orgument galat he
 Make it clear that it is either a matter of service or not, because we think it is a matter of education - we believe that the bill can be passed, because the government's intention is to rule the teachers - LG has written the letter Sent that this is our case
 to aap pakkaa kar do
 
 ham to aaj shaam ko bill ko paas karke rajanivas bhej rahe hai- ham bhi pareshaan ho gaye hai
 
 agar sadan kii takat he to paas karo, vidhansabha kisalie he, kanoon banane ke liye he or ham vahi kar rahe hai- desh beuroperesi se nahin, demokrasi se chalata he- adhikariyon se nahin ham logon se desh chalata he- nahin maananaa he to aap is bill ko mat maano, lekin alji se paas karaao- bhaajapa ke nangepan ko dikhaanaa chahta hum
 If there is something wrong with this bill, then fix it - they are talking about the officers, they have scared them agar aap south dilli main rahete hai or ashram, dendi yaa noida jane ke liye ring road kaa istemaal karte hai to behatar hoga ki aap 30 may tak is raste se bachein
 Actually, PWD has started repairing Lajpat Nagar flyover
 marammat kaa ye kaam 30 may tak chalegaa
 During this period, the portion of the Lajpat Nagar flyover from Moolchand to the Ashram will remain closed for traffic till May 30
 haalanki fliover ke neeche se moolchand se ashram jane vaali sadak chaalu rahegi or isapar se yatayaat saamaanya or yathaavat rahegaa
 Actually, it was planned to be repaired in two phases after the Lajpat Nagar flyover at Gap a few months ago
 pehle charan main fliover ke ashram se moolchand kii taraf aane vaale hisse ko band kiya gaya tha or ab duusari taraf yani moolchand se ashram kii taraf jane vaale hisse ko band kiya gaya he
 Although the flyover from Moolchand to the Ashram has been closed but the road leading from below is on, but due to its width, traffic pressure is likely to remain high during peak traffic hours, especially in the morning
 vaikalpik raste kii salaahdilli trephic police ne marammat ke kaam ke maddenjar ring road kaa istemaal karne waalon ke liye adwiseri jari kii he
 The traffic police has said that to avoid the jam, avoid going towards Lajpat Nagar flyover
 jise sarai kaalen khan or dendi yaa noida kii taraf janaa he wo barapula fliover kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 At the same time, Delhi Traffic Police has advised to use Outer Ring Road to go to Faridabad
 yah saal naukariyon ke lihaaj se behtareen hone ja rahaa he
 First the banks opened the doors of jobs on a large scale and then the Railways talked about 1
25 lakh jobs
 lekin ab chaar companiyaan saamne ai hai jo bade paimaane par naukariyaan dengi
 The economic newspaper The Economic Times reports that four private companies Ernst & Young, pwc, KPMG and Deloitte will employ 43,000 people over the next four years
 aisa isliye sambhav hua he ki tair 2 or tair 3 shaharon main bijness badha he, telecom industry main vikaas ho rahaa he, infrastracchar pariyojnaon main teji ai he or antarrashtriya companiyon ne in par dhyaan dena shuru kiya he
 Graduates, engineers, cas and mbas will benefit the most
 60 se 89 pratishat naukariyaan inhen hi milengi
 These people will get an annual salary of Rs 3 lakh to Rs 11 lakh
 in companiyon ke alaava inaki partner companiyaan bhi bade paimaane par rojgaar de sakati hai
 Overall, there is an atmosphere of optimism in the market at this time
 in chaaron main sabase choti company he kepiemji or uske paas 8,000 karmchaaree hai lekin company kii yojana he ki vah agle chaal saalon main 9,000 or karmchaariyon ko niyukt kare
 Ernst & Young will provide the maximum employment with 18,000 employees and intends to employ 22,000 to 25,000 people over the next four years
