 Erdogan was beginning to suspect the presence of a powerful 'guillenist movement' in Turkish society, in which he feared the involvement of the media and police and judiciary
 1999 main gilen america aa gaye
 Only after this he was tried for treason in Turkey
 iske baad se gilen ne saarvajanik jivan se ekadam khud ko alag kar liya
 He was barely seen among the public
 koi intervyuu bhi nahin dete
 At the end of 2013, the animosity between these two top pillars had become quite vocal

 After all, what is the fear? As Arvind Kejriwal's cut, the BJP fielded Kiran Bedi, but she is not able to communicate properly with the voters
 kejariwal jahaan apni har baat samajhane main kaamyaab ho rahe hai, vahiin kiran bedi logon se conect nahin ho paa rahi hai
 Kejriwal is increasing his penetration among slums and the lower middle class, but for the BJP it still remains a crooked kheer
 kiran bedi ko upar se thope jane or tikat bantwaare ko lekar party main shuru hui kalah khatm nahin ho paa rahi he
 The leaders of Delhi BJP are present in the campaign but they are doing the work with upper mind
 agar bijepi ko ye dar sata rahaa tha to stritegi badalane kaa alaava koi chaara bhi na tha
 Fear not defense, Offense Apokanejriwal believes in aggressive politics from the beginning
 aise main kejariwal yaa unki team roj kisi na kisi mudde ko lekar virodhiyon par hamalaa bol detii he – or bijepi netaa puure din bas bachaav vaale bayaan dete rahete the
 Now the BJP is in attacking mode against Kejriwal - and five questions are being raised daily by the party
 haalanki, kejariwal counter atake main bhi maahir hai

 How helpful is 'votkatwa'? The 'votkatwa' formula has been in practice for years in elections in which dummy candidates are put up to cut the opponent's vote
 bijepi ke ranneetikaron ko lagata he ki agar congress logon ko apni ore khinchegi to aap kaa vot kategaa – iskaa phayda sidhaa bijepi ko hoga
 That is why the strategy of attacking Kejriwal and being soft towards Congress has been adopted

Maybe yes, and maybe not too! congress ke diggaj netaa manish tiwari ne twitor ke jariye ol india muslim personal lau board (empielbi) par tikhaa hamalaa kiya he
 He has questioned the Board's attitude on the issue of divorce thrice, whether Muslims are above the personal law constitution

 Congress spokesperson and lawyer by profession Manish Tiwari tweeted, 'is Mohammedan law allowing divorce thrice, is it above the Indian Constitution? Shouldn't protection of Muslim women in unilateral divorce be ensured? 'can Mohammedan Law that allows Triple Talaq be above Indian Constitution? Are Muslim women not entitled to protection from arbitrary divorces— Manish Tewari (@manishtewari) March 24, 2016 Manish Tiwari said The right to freedom of religion, given in Articles 25 and 26 of the Indian Constitution, has become a means to justify the fallible practices concealing the facts

 He argues that the Hindu Civil Code was passed in 1956, but discrimination among Hindus did not end with caste
 muslim personal lau board nekya kahaol india muslim personal lau board (empielbi) ne desh kisarvocch adaalat ke nirdeshko na sirf maanane se inkaar kar diya he, balki use uske adhikaar kshetra se baahar bataaya he
 Taking suo motu cognizance, the Muslim Personal Law had instructed to examine the legal validity of the practice of terminating the relationship, saying divorce thrice
 jabaki empielbi ne kaha he ki yah court ke kshetradhikaar main nahin he
 The Law Board states that the personal laws of the community are based on the Quran, so it is not within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to review it
 empielbi ne kaha ki yah koi sansad se paas kiya hua kanoon nahin he
 The board also challenged the utility of the Uniform Civil Code, saying it was not a guarantee of national integrity and unity
 inkaa tark he ki ek sajhi aasthaa isai deshon ko do vishwa yudhon se alag rakhane main naakaam rahi
 The AIMPLB said that the Hindu Code Bill similarly did not eradicate caste discrimination

 Whether senior officers or a large section belonging to businessmen and middle-class families, it is more appropriate to enroll their children in private schools than in government schools
 lekin ab ye paripati tuutane vaali he
 The latest case is from Balrampur district of Chhattisgarh
 yahaan ke colector ne apane bachche kaa daakhila privet skul ke bajaaye sarkari skool main karaayaa he
 Education has started in government schools in the state from June 15
 colector avinaash kumaar sharan ne apni paanch varshiya beti kaa daakhila sarkari skool main karaayaa he
 She has chosen Government Pragya Primary School for her daughter's primary education
 colector sahabaki is pahal se ab lagata he ki sarkari skulon kii padhai par uth rahi ungliyaan ab tham jaaengi
 It is obvious that the school in which the district collector's children will study will automatically improve the standard of education of that school
 logon ko jab yah khabar lagi ki jile ke colector ke bachche aam sarkari skool main pard rahe hai to is par achaanak kisi ko bharosa nahin hua, lekin skool main jab colector sahab kii beti padhai ke liye aati-jaati dikhaai di to unhen yakeen hua
 Children of top bureaucrats in Chhattisgarh are studying in private branded schools
 kai afasaron ke bachche praathmik shiksha ke liye rajya ke baahar or videsho main rah kar padhai kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the enrollment of an IAS officer's girl in a government school is remarkable
 baharhaal logon ko ummid he ki aisi pahal or duusare afasar bhi karenge
 By and large his move will definitely remove the condition of government schools

 If Balasaheb Thackeray were alive today, he would be very happy
 apane mukhpatr saamana main jarur likhte ki 'maharashtra ko nayaa sammaan, sachin tendulkar bharat ratna' shaayad ve ye bhi jodna nahin bhoolatey ki sachin pehle maharashtra ratna hai, ise kabhi bhoolanaa nahin chahie
 And yes, while praising Sachin, Balasaheb would also have forgotten that he had lashed out at Sachin for calling him 'mumbai everybody' two years ago
 ab ye sanjog kii baat hi he ki balasahab ke nidhan kii barsi ke mahaj ek din pehle hi sachin ritair hue or unhen bharat ratna dene kaa elaan bhi kiya gaya
 Balasaheb's personality was similar
 virodh karte to aise ki jaise usase bada koi dushman nahin or tarif karte to aise ki jaise usase bada koi mitra nahin
 His same style was also hit from Sharad Pawar to ordinary journalists
 lekin unki yahi chhavi maharashtra main un tamaam logon ko unke saath jodne main kaamyaab rahi
 It was extremely difficult to predict what Balasaheb would say and what stand he would take
 unki isi incredibal image ke kaayal the shiv sainik
 Bal Thackeray was a close ally of the BJP in the NDA, his old friendship with Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 lekin pradhanmantri vaajapeyi kaa bhari sabha main majaak udaana bhi unke liye bahut aasaan-sa kaam tha
 Shiv Senas launched a fierce movement against Sanjay Dutt, even telling him to be the real 'villain'
 usee ko jail se chhudwakar bal thakare ne kaha ki agar sanjay dutt ko doshi paaya gaya to sajaa do, magar tab tak takalif mat do
 Nobody could understand this Thakreiniti
 unke saath khadey logon ne bhi kabhi is par aapatti nahin jataai
 Sharad Pawar was his biggest enemy in Maharashtra politics
 reliyon main jab pavaar kii baat nikalati to balasahab kii jubaan hameshaa phisalati, baavjood iske unki vyaktigat dosti main kabhi antar nahin aayaa
 And the general public also knew this thing very well
 sharad pavaar ko jubaani shikaar banane vaale bhi yahi the or agar pavaar pradhanmantri banate hai to shivasena samarthan degi, ye kehane vaale bhi balasahab the
 Balasaheb, who attacked the journalist and his offices, forgot that he too is an editor
 iske baavjood sabase zyada khabar dene vaale balasahab hi rahe
 Such a big difference between words and actions openly, but i have not yet seen any other leader who rules the hearts of millions
 kisi ne sahi kaha tha ki shivasena jaisi party keval balasahab hi chalaa sakate hai
 Sometimes Marathiism sometimes Hindutva, sometimes support for Congress and sometimes Sharad Pawar applause
 har mode par nayaa rasta apana lene, nai bhoomika main saamne aane ke baavjood cader par sakht pakad rakhane kii kasarat balasahab hi kar paae
 Balasaheb Thackeray recognized the pulse of the crowd
 unka ye mizaaj unhen sabase lokapriy netaa to bana gaya, lekin apane balboote kabhi satta tak nahin pahunchaa paaya
 However, he had the power to get his point across even without power, and that was why the party measured 45 years under his leadership

 He is running the party with his style

 He has prepared his generation and now he is not going to challenge them at least in the party
 par phir bhi baahar unke saamne kai chunautiyaan hai
 Even though he could not do politics like his father, but he has learned politics from his father
uddhav Thackeray's pita kaa karishma or 'neusans value' uddhav thakare ke paas he, ye unhen pataa he
 Uddhav is preparing a party of his own image, but in order to run the party, he will have to keep the image of his father with the Shiv Sena

 In Shivaji Park, you will visit the memorial built on the anniversary of Balasaheb, from the general public to the respected people, but until the magic of these five letters 'bal Thackeray' will not be felt, the magic of 'shiv Sena' will not be effective

 We are not saying that Radhe Maa should be present, but this is what the Mumbai Police is saying
 chunki ek mahila ne radhe maa par uske sasuraal waalon ko dahej utpeedan ke liye uksaane kaa aarope lagaaya he or isi silsile main mubai police ne bhi radhe maa ko ek saman bhej kar unase is maamle kii tafteesh ke liye police stesan main hajir hone kaa farmaan sunaaya he
 After Mumbai, complaints have also been filed against Radhe Ma in Bhopal and Kutch in Gujarat
 yani aane vaale din radhe maa kii mushkilen badha sakate hai
 Radhe Maa, who claimed to have overcome the sufferings of her devotees and every crisis, has now got herself into trouble
 darasal mumbai police ne radhe maa ko ek saman jari kiya he or wo aane vaale dinon main radhe maa se poochtacha kar sakati he
 Since Radhe Maa has been accused of inciting dowry harassment as well as spreading lewdness in her satsangs, till now the police had not taken any action against her in two different areas of Mumbai despite a complaint against Radhe Maa
 is maamle ke 6 or aropiyon se poochtacha ke liye ek saman bheja gaya he
 In fact, a Mumbai woman has accused Radhe Maa that at the behest of Radhe Maa, her in-laws are demanding a dowry of Rs 25 lakh from her family members
 itnaa hi nahin mumbai kii hi ek mahila vakil phalguni bahmbhatt radhe maa par ye aarope lagaaya he ki wo apane satsang ke naam par paakhand karti hai or ashleelata failaati hai
 When Radhe Maa reached Mumbai from Aurangabad on Sunday morning, our correspondent at the airport once again asked her about the charges leveled against her, and Radhe said that all the allegations against her are false and nature will be judged
 or jab unase ye poocha gaya ki un par dahej utpeedan kaa bhi aarope he to is par bhi radhe maa kaa jawaab taiyaar tha
 After this, Radhe Ma herself did not say anything directly on the question of police investigation, but one of her devotees said that she will cooperate with the police in investigating the allegations against Radhe Maa
 radhe maa ke bhakton kaa kahana he ki wo jo bhi kahati hanore jo kuch karti hai
 No one else can do it like that, but now their saying and doing has brought them into controversies, has put them in trouble
 mumbai ke baad bhopal ke kamala nagar thane main bhi ek shaks ne radhe maa ke khilaaf logon kibhaawanaaon ko aahatkarne kii shikaayat darj karwaai he
 Not only this, 6 people have filed a complaint against Radhe Ma in Kutch, Gujarat
 is shikaayat ke mutabik in logon ne apni tamaam sampatti radhe maa ke namisaliye daan dedi thi ki unke halaat main kuch sudhaar hoga lekin vaisaa kuch bhi nahin hua
 Now as the bundle of complaints against Radhe Ma is increasing, it seems that Radhe is not bringing any good news for her mother in the coming days

 To clarify that the picture is of Ekta Yatra, we spoke to journalist Uday Mahurkar, who has written a book on Modi called 'marching with a Billion'
 unhone bataaya ki yah tasviir sambhavat: dilli kii he, jo ekta yatra shuru hone ke pehle lee gai he
 Thus, there is a lot of evidence that this viral photo of Modi was taken during the bjp's Ekta Yatra in 1991-92
 haalanki, ham apane str se yah daawa nahin kar sake ki yah photo kis taarikh ko or kis shahar main khinchi gai thi
 What happens when you come to know that Kangana and Karan Johar came face to face in the same event? The relationship between the two is well known
 haal hi main donon mukesh ambani kii party main najar aae
 But what happened after that is interesting to know
 karan johar or kangana ranut kaa jabase vivaad hua he tabhi se donon ek-duusare se koson dur najar aate hai
 But it was not possible for both to decline Mukesh Ambani's invitation
 mumbai mir kii maane to ambani donon actors ke rishton ke bare main achche se jaanate hai
 So he took care that both of them should not face each other
 kangana nahin, asal main rithik ne inhen diya he dhokhaakangana or karan johar kii sitting ek-duusare ke apojit thi
 Karan arrived early at the party
 vah party main teesri line main baithe hue the, vahiin kangana karan johar kii entry ke 15 minute baad pahunchin
 He was seated in the line opposite Karan
 khabaron kii maane to nita ambani se milane ke baad kangana jaldi main party se nikal gayi
 Kangana looked very beautiful in blue dress in this event
 vahinkaran joharablike suut main najar aae
 Let me tell you, this party of Mukesh Ambani was organized to celebrate Mami Festival
 is party main aamir khan, kiran raav, jaayra wasim samet kai sitare maujuud the
 Aamir and Kiran were special guests in this
 rithik maamle par kangana kii bahan or vakil kaa jawaab- kabhi nahin lene di photokangna or karan johar kaa vivaad coffee vid karan se shuru hua tha
 In this show, Kangana described him as a promoter of movie mafia and nepotism
 iske baad se hi donon ke bich bayanon kaa silsilaa jari he
 Karan Johar has supported Hrithik in Kangana and Hrithik's Controversy
 agast2008kii ek subah ham chennai se sriharikota ke satish dhawan spes centre pahunche the
 i had also reached the village street cover among dozens of space-journalists from all over the world
 bharat apana pehla moon mishan chandrayan kaa prakshepan karne vaala tha
 There were journalists from all over the world who had been covering space launch for many years
 yahi unka kaaryakshetra bhi tha
 They were skeptical and surprised at the success of India
 bharat kii taraf se do chaar hi anbhavi patrkaar the
 The rest were taking photos and making videos
 baharhaal barish kii boonden kuch second ke liye ruki or utani hi der main chandrayan apane lakshya kii taraf nikal gaya
 It was proud to see that moment and show it to the audience
 uske baad ham sabhi chat se utar kar ek bade se sabhaagaar main laae gaye,jahaan chandrayan project se jude vaigyanikon ne ham sabko bataaya
 At that time the head of ISRO was G
 Madhavan
 sainkadon camere ke saamne desh ke vaigyanik desh se baat kar rahe the
 For a few days after that, the same scientists were going to many news channels and telling about their success
 2008kii kamyaabi maamuli nahin thi
 Even then there was a Prime Minister in India named Manmohan Singh
 unhone badhai di or baaki vaigyanikon par chhod diya ki ve desh se samvaad karen
 ISRO scientists were in front of hundreds of cameras
 manmohan singh or unase pehle ke kisi pradhanmantri ne isro kii kamyaabi ko apane chunavi poster main istamaal nahin kiya
 On Wednesday, as soon as Mission Shakti was successful, the poster of Narendra Modi with pictures of missile started running in whatsapp University
 yahi nahin27march ko jab bharat ne e-sat missile kshamta kaa pareekshan kiya to camaron ke saamne se saare vaigyanik gaayab kar die gaye
 Only and only the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi was in front
 is kamyaabi kii ek hi tasviir janata ke bich pahunchi he
 Picture of Narendra Modi addressing the name of the nation
 unke sahyogi ise faisalaa lene vaali sarkaar kii kamyaabi bataate rahe
 Pictures of celebrating scientists were also not seen at the time of launch and testing
 ndtvke archive main -19april2012kaa ek video footage he
 At that time, India successfully test-fired the satellite missile agni-v at low-orbit
 video main tab kenneshtauke nideshak jashn manaate dikh rahe hai
 On 27 March 2019, Dr
 DRDO also held the post of Director

 His team was missing
 unki jagahiidhshmause ritair or is samay niti ayog ke sadsy ban chuke vijay saraswat media main iske bare main gyaan de rahe the
 The current chairman and scientist disappeared from the country
 ek ritair kiya hua chairman gyaan de rahaa tha taaki vah isi bahaane upie sarkaar par tippanee kar sake ki usne mishan shakti kii anumati nahin di
 Later, with the help of these statements, Arun Jaitley was attacking the Congress at the BJP headquarters
 maujuuda chairman yah baat nahin kah sakate the kyonki chunaav ke kaaran aachaar samhita lagu he
 While the same VK Saraswat had said on 10 February 2010 that India has satellite missile capability but it would not demonstrate its capability by hitting the real satellite
 bharat isaki zarurat mahasoos nahin karata kyonki isse antariksh main kachra paidaa hota he
 These wastes cause damage to the system of satellites in space
 us samaybaishmaucheef rahete hue ve ke saraswat ne jo kaha maan liya gaya
 Today, as a member of the NITI Aayog, Saraswat is targeting the UPA government
 aap inke bayaan ko internet main search kar sakate hai
 Like NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar, VK Saraswat has also violated the code of conduct
 zaahir he yah raajnneeti he
 ISRO and defense research are being used by Narendra Modi for his political interest
 unka raashtra ke naam sambodhan karnaa or kuch nahin balki matadaataaon ko prabhavit karnaa tha
 After Pulwama, he wanted something that would cause discussion and questions on the failure of five years
 jo samvaadadaata ujjwala yojana kii kaamiyon kii reporting thik se nahin kar pate vahi buudhvaar ko din bhar antariksh vigyaan ke export ban gaye
 His reporting was scant
 modi kaa gungan tha or vipaksh kaa uphaas
 ISRO had become the center of BJP and Narendra Modi's politics in the name of the country from September 2014 when Prime Minister Modi was present among scientists himself during Mangalyaan
 usee din tay ho gaya tha ki bharat kii vaigyanik kamyaabi vaigyanikon kii nahin hogi,pradhanmantri modi kii hogi
 China also tested this capability but did not come on TV and tell the world
 yahi parampara rahi he
 The success of space science is left to the scientists
 lekin ab yah sab modi ke liye propeganda kaa hissaa bhar hai
 The Election Commission is investigating Narendra Modi's address to the nation
 ayog ke kanoonee salaahkaar rahe mendiratta ne'da print'se kaha he ki unhone aachaar samhita lagu hone ke baad kisi pradhanmantri ko kabhi aisa karte nahin dekha
 The Prime Minister has used many such words in his address which have been used on his political platforms
 yah maamla chunaav ayog kaa imtihaan he
 i doubt the commission will do anything
 vah bahaane dhund laaegaa
 Are we seeing the conclusion of the Election Commission as an institution? The finale airs live! o nation! Arise, now you address these institutions
 bahut der ho chuki he
 Do not look at these institutions lying on the bed of death

 ) The leadership of the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is now recognized by American experts
 america sheersh visheshgyon ke anusaar, uttarapradesh or uttarakhand ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa kii shandaar jeet ke baad varsh 2019 ke aam chunaavon ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi spasht taur par ek pasandida netritvkarta ke taur par ubhare hai
 One expert said that the results of the assembly elections held in five states showed that the 2014 Lok Sabha election results were not unusual
 ek anya visheshgy ne kaha ki aisa lagata he ki modi 2019 ke baad bhi bharat kaa netritv karte rahenge
 Adam Geigfeld, assistant professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, said assembly elections do not indicate much change
 uttarapradesh chunaav ke nateezon ne dikhaaya he ki varsh 2014 ke aam chunaav koi ‘asaamaanya’ cheez nahin the
 The comments unhone kaha, ‘yah bhaajapa ke liye ek badi jeet thi
 Its candidate won by far more than the two previous winners - BSP and SP
 ’american enterproij institute ke shodharthi sadanand dhume ne kaha ki in chunaavon ne modi ko varsh 2019 ke chunaav ke liye ek ‘spasht or pasandida vijeta’ ke taur par sthapit kar diya he
 He said, 'modi is at the forefront of the 2019 race
 ’ georgetaun uniwarsity ke walsh skool of fahrren sarvice ke professor irfan nuruddin ne kaha ki varsh 2019 main bhaajapa ko sidhaa bahumat milane kii sambhaavna kam he or modi gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane kii disha main badhenge
 He said that bjp's election campaign in successive states has been successful, while the opposition has failed to do so
 nuruddin ne kaha ki jis rajya main party ko sidhe vipaksh kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, vahaan yah acha pradarshan nahin karti
 If the opposition comes together, the BJP can be defeated
 unhone kaha ki party ko jab bikhare hue vipaksh kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, vahaan use laabh miltaa he
 In the year 2019, anti-incumbency wave will be present
 chunaav ke dauraan uttarapradesh main maujuud rahe dhume ne kaha ki in chunaavon main bhaajapa ne khud ko jati se upar bataaya lekin vahaan jati card khelaa
 Quoting conversations with people in the state, he said, 'demonetisation is extremely popular
 isane us bhartiya janata kaa dil or dimag jeet liya, jo is niti ke chalate pareshaan hui
 There is a serious person here, who has made a principled attack on the corrupt and rich people
 ’ haalanki dhume ne yah bhi kaha ki uttarapradesh main is aitihaasik jeet ke baad modi sambhavat: aise aarthik sudhaar kii disha main nahin badhenge, jaisaa nijee kshetra chahta he
 In the Council on Foreign Relations, senior researcher for the affairs of India, Pakistan and South Asia, Alyssa Aires said that India is going to step up its economic reforms which directly affect the people of the country
 bhaajapa ab rajyasabha main bahut si siten hasil karegi, jo use bhoomi adhigrahan adhinium or shram sudhaar jaise lambit sudhaaron ko anjaam dene main madad karengi
 He will start gaining seats in the year 2018
 bhaajapa varsh 2019 or iske pare dekh rahi he
 He said, 'it was a big win for the BJP
 uskaa ummidavaar do pichley vijetaon-basapa or sapa kii tulana main kahin adhik antar se jeet gaya
 Sadanand Dhume, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, said that these elections have established Modi as a 'clear and preferred winner' for the 2019 election
 unhone kaha, ‘modi varsh 2019 kii daud main sabase aage hai
 Professor Irfan Nooruddin of Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service said that in 2019, the BJP is less likely to get a straight majority and Modi will move towards forming a coalition government
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kaa ek ke baad ek rajya main chunaav prachaar safal rahaa he jabaki vipaksh aisa karne main naakaam rahaa he
 Nooruddin said that in a state where the party has to face direct opposition, it does not perform well
 yadi vipaksh ek saath aa jaae to bhaajapa ko parrast kiya ja saktaa he
 He said that when the party has to face scattered opposition, it gets an advantage there
 varsh 2019 main sattavirohi lahar maujuud hogi
 Dhume, who was present in Uttar Pradesh during the election, said that in these elections, BJP described itself as above caste but played the caste card there
 rajya main logon ke saath hui baatcheet kaa hawala dete hue unhone kaha, ‘notebandi behad lokapriy he
 It won the hearts and minds of the Indian public, who were troubled by this policy
 yahaan ek sanjeeda vyakti he, jisane bhrasht or amir logon par ek saidhantik prahaar kiya he
 However, Dhume also said that after this historic victory in Uttar Pradesh, Modi will probably not move in the direction of economic reform as the private sector wants
 council on fahrren rilations main bharat, pakistan or dakshin asia ke maamalon kii varisht shodharthi alisa yrs ne kaha ki bharat apane un aarthik sudhaaron ko badhaane ja rahaa he, jo desh kii janata ko sidhe taur par prabhavit karte hai
 The BJP will now gain a lot of seats in the Rajya Sabha, which will help it execute pending reforms like the Land Acquisition Act and Labor Reforms
 vah varsh 2018 main siten hasil karnaa shuru kar denge
 The BJP is looking ahead to the year 2019 and beyond
 chunaav ke dauraan uttarapradesh main maujuud rahe dhume ne kaha ki in chunaavon main bhaajapa ne khud ko jati se upar bataaya lekin vahaan jati card khelaa

 chamaki bukhaar ke kahar ko dekhte hue adaalat se apil kii gai he ki turant is maamle main dakhal de

 yachika main daawa kiya he gaya he ki bihar rajya is beemaari ko failane se rokane ke liye jo kadam uthaaye jane chahie the use lagu karne main fail rahaa he

 aakhir saatvin vishwa prasannataa report 2019 aa gai
 India has fallen from 133 to 140th position in 2018
 finland pehle sthaan par bana he
 When India is moving forward in every field, it also becomes necessary to know why we are not happy? The concept of measuring happiness started from Bhutan itself
 bhutan ke prastaav par satat vikaas samaadhaan network ne sanyukt raashtra sangh ke liye varsh 2012 main pehali vishwa prasannataa report jari kii thi or 20 march ko vishwa prasannataa diwas ghoshit kiya tha
 In the first report, India was ranked 111 and Denmark was ranked first
 vishwa prasannataa report aate hi har saal prasannataa se jude kai gambhir prashn ubharate hai or jawaab kii talash main phir se gum bhi jate hai
 Since the First World Happiness Report, there are few countries that remain in the first ten places such as Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, Austria, Iceland, Australia, and New Zealand
 inaki ranking main sirf thodaa utaar-chadhaav hota he
 Ironically, no country in Asia was included in the first ten
 vishesh rup se dakshin asia ke deshon kii sthiti bahut chintajanak he
 Obviously, these countries are backward in both peace and human development
 prasannataa ke suchakanko or arthvyavastha ke suchakaankon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan se ek dilachasp tasviir ubhartee he
 At the same time, the serious question also arises whether the fast growing economy has a direct effect on the indicators of happiness as well? Assessing India's situation will be helpful in understanding this interrelation
 kai kamjor or choti arthvyavastha vaale desh prasannataa kii sthiti main bharat se kai guna aage hai
 Claims are being made about India's economy that it will soon stand up against China
 to kya phir ham sabase khushhaal desh ban jaayenge? kahana mushkil he
 Bhutan, which conceptualizes the National Happiness Index, is also behind
 prasannataa kii gananaa main bharat pichhadta ja rahaa he
 It becomes clear that geographical enormity, social and economic inequality, styles of governance, social and educational level of population, religious and spiritual behavior are some of the reasons that have been overlooked in measuring happiness
 kya sakal gharelu utpaada kii gananaa main prasannataa ke suchakaankon kii gananaa ko shaamil kiya janaa chahie?visheshgyon main is maamle par matbhed he
 The biggest argument is that happiness is a state of mind
 har vyakti or desh ke liye iske alag–alag arth hai or alag-alag kaaran bhi ho sakate hai
 For example, the things that make the people of India happy is not the situation in other countries of the world
 prasannataa ke sanketakon ko gadhane vaala desh bhutan prasannataa ke sanketako kii gananaa main kaaphi neeche he
 Bhutan is a Buddhist country
 bhutan main prasannataa kii jo sthitiyaan he us par buddha kii shikshaaon kaa gaharaa prabhaav he
 The Buddha has told the four Aryan truths
 dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he
 Grief is eliminated
 nivaaran kaa maarg uplabdh he
 The common Bhutanese citizen naturally understands the skill of being happy while assimilating the teachings of the Buddha
 jin deshon kii ranking pehle 10 deshon main he vahaan yishu kii shikshaayen grahan kii jaati he
 From this point of view, the philosophical vision of the citizens of India should be of high order
 aakhir har kshetra main vikaas karne ke baavjood bharat ke aam naagarik khush kyon nahin rah pate? bharat ko prasannataa ke apane suchakank viksit karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 In the Global Index of Happiness, the structure of Indian society and the various streams created in it cannot be counted
 bhartiya samaaj kii banaavat aisi he ki yahaan har naagarik khush rah saktaa he
 a society full of traditions, customs, festivities, art-culture, festivals, food and variety gives thousands of opportunities for happiness
 holi or deepawali jaise tyoharon par puraa samaaj khush rahata he
 There is hardly any country in the world as many sweets shops are in India
 mithai or khushi kaa cholii daaman kaa saath he
 The conditions at which happiness is assessed are all related to developmental processes
 dilachasp baat yah he ki sabase badi arthvyavastha vaala america taaja report main 19wein sthaan par he jo pichley saal se ek paaydaan neeche he
 Study reports of happiness are usually prepared on indicators such as per capita income, GDP, health which includes average age, social support, mutual trust, freedom to make life decisions and generosity
 har saal sthitiyaan vishwa str par badal jaati hai
 For example, the 2017 report had studies on the relationship of employment status and happiness
 jab tak har naagarik ke paas garimapurna rojgaar nahin hota vah khush nahin rah saktaa
 The horrors of unemployment are not hidden in India
 bhrashtachar kaa bane rahanaa bhi prasannataa ke liye ghaatak he
 This is India's biggest problem
 vishwa prasannataa report-2018 main finland ko pehla sthaan mila tha
 It was followed by Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and Australia
 america 18wein, bharat 133wein or bhutan 97 wein sthaan par tha
 As far as sensitivity to the fabric of society, spiritual nature and values like peace and mutual brotherhood is concerned, India need not be unhappy with its ranking

 Ram Lalla's lawyer CS Vaidyanathan said that from the Muslim side it was initially said that there is nothing under the ground, but later they said that the structure found inside the land is Islamic structure
 ramalala ke vakil si es vaidhanathan ne ASI kii report main mandir ke avshesh mili he, elahabaad HC ne bhi ASI kii report ko sahi mana he
 CS Vaidyanathan said that the structure under the Babri Masjid was built with photographs of the Gods found in it, sculptures prove that the temple was already there
 vaidhanathan ne kaha masjid girane ke baad ek pathar kaa slab mila, jinamein 12 yaa 13veen shatabdi main likhe ek shilaalekh shaamil hai
 The inscription is slightly damaged and the last two lines are heavily damaged
 shilaalekh kaa mul paath sanskrit main he
 No one has objected to its translation, only objected to its place
 shilalekhon par ullekh saket mandal main bane mandir se he or yah ram ke janm kaa sthaan he
 The king of Saket Mandla was Govinda Chandra in the 12th century, Ayodhya was his capital at that time
 yahaan vishnu hari kaa bahut bada mandir tha
 This slab was seen by a reporter from Panchjanya
 ayodhya ram mandir par justise chandrachud ne poocha ki kya is shilaalekh ko bhi lekar chalange kiya gaya he? jis par vaidyanathan ne jawaab diya ki slab par likhe gaye content kii transleshan yaa is shilaalekh kii pramanikta ko chalange nahin kiya gaya he, balki is sawaal is par uthaaya gaya he ki ye slab vivaadit zamin se mila he yaa nahin
 He has presented some photographs taken before the court in 1950
 ramalala ke vakil si es vaidhanathan ne kaha, pathar ki vaidhata or sahi hone par koi sawaal nahin he
 The translation of Sanskrit letters written in stone is Shikhar Range Kala Vishnu Hari Mandir which is also mentioned in the historical book
 115 semi lanbaa or 55 semi chaudaa shilaalekh teen chaar saptaah ram katha kunj main rakhaa rahaa
 This structure was found after the collapse
 is par kisi paksh car kii ore se aapatti nahin jataai gai he
 Justice Chandrachud said that all this was gathered by ASI? Ramlala's lawyer Vaidyanathan said that it was not in the ASI report, the ASI came much later
 sies vaidyanathan ne ASI report kaa hawala dete hue magaramchh, kachhuon kaa bhi zikr kiya or kaha ki inkaa muslim culture se matlab nahin tha
 Vaidyanathan deposed before the court the reporter's report of Panchajanya's time of dismantling the disputed structure
 report main likhaa he ki dhahaane ke dauraan maine shilaayein girti hui dekhin thim tab kuch police vaale un pattharon ko uthaa kar ramakatha kunj le gaye
 These rocks were 4 feet x2 feet in size
 wo shilaalekh rajya puraatatv vibhaag ke abhiraksha (castady) main he
 Vaidyanathan said, after a scientific investigation of the remains found from the excavation, the ASI report, the evidence found from the spot leaves no doubt or controversy
 ye sab 11veen sadi ke dauraan nirmit hai

 Announce the protest against Sonia Gandhi's political arrow 'modi-amit Shah' from Ramlila Maidan, where there is black money, for which demonetisation has been done 'congress President Sonia Gandhi at the Save India rally in Ramlila Maidan about the country's economic policies Strongly attacked the Narendra Modi government
 sonia gandhi ne modi or amit shah kii jodi par barasate hue kaha ki jis kaledhan ke liye notebandi kii gai wo kaala dhan aakhir he kahaan
 Sonia asked why the treasury of Modi government has become empty
 is baat kii jaanch honi chahie
 The three top Congress leadership of Gandhi on Saturday at a stage against the government, Gandhi, Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka looked extremely aggressive on the Modi government
 priyanka gandhi ne unnav, kisaan, rojgaar jaise mudde uthaae
 Rahul Gandhi bluntly said that his name is not Rahul Savarkar Gandhi and he is not going to apologize
 priyanka or rahul ke baad manch par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ain or modi sarkaar par aaropon or siyaasi hamalon kii bauchhaar kar di
 Where is the black money? Congress President Sonia Gandhi said, Who has the money that was demonetized for Kikaladhan? sonia gandhi ne kaha, "aaj andher nagari chaupat raja jaisaa haal he, puraa desh poocha rahaa he sabakaa saath
 
 
 Where is everyone's development? 
 
 arthvyavastha kyon neeche ja rahi he, rojgaar kahaan chalaa gaya he
 Should there be an investigation as to why the black money for which the demonetisation was enacted did not come out, where has the money gone, who has the black money? "why did the RBI treasury empty? Sonia Gandhi It is said that the Narendra Modi government implemented GST at midnight with great fanfare
 iske baad modi sarkaar kaa khajaana khaali kyon ho gaya? RBI se lakhon karod rupye kyon liye gaye? navratna companiyaan kyon bechi ja rahi hai? in sabaki jaanch honi chahie
 Sonia Gandhi said that nowadays the atmosphere of the country has become such that when free currents are imposed and removed
 sonia ne kaha ki ye logasanvidhan divasamanane kaa daawa karte hai, lekin har roj samvidhan kii dhajjiyaan udaate hai
 During this, Congress President Sonia Gandhi said that we have all come here because the condition of the country has become very bad for a long time
 hamaari jimmedaari banati he ki apane gharon se baahar nikalen or iske khilaaf andolan karen
 He said that suffering injustice is not good under any circumstances
 marij ke liye ek ambulance ames main ghantebhar se zyada khadi rahi, lekin koi phayda nahin hua
 Frustrated from here, the ambulance left for the nearby Safarjung Hospital
 hamane rishtedaar se baat kii to pataa chalaa ki yahaan bed nahin he, lihaaja duusare aspataal kaa rukh karnaa hoga
 The relatives of the patient do not even know that the treatment will be done in Safdarjung and the bed will be found
 bas ilaaj ke ummid ke bharose bhatakati ambulance
 The problem of not recruiting patients from ambulances is not just a matter of one place
 ames ke baad ab ham dilli ke hi jibi pant hospital pahunche
 There was no long wait when an ambulance was seen outside the emergency carrying a heart patient from Greater Noida
 gharavaale immergency main daakhile kii koshish karte rahe, lekin ambulance ko yahaan se opidi main janaa padaa
 LNJP Hospital is nearby
 jabatak ham vahaan pahunchate, greater noida se ai ambulance bhi marij ke saath opidi se dhakke khaakar yahaan bhi aa pahunchi
 Talking with relatives here also showed that he had a heart attack, but no one cared
 marij jie yaa mare
 After traveling about 70 to 80 km, GB Pant had to reach here and about 3 hours were wasted just due to the emergency OPD and then LNJP
 musiibat main ghire parivaar ko dekhakar laga madad kii koshish karne main kya harj he
 So, they walked with them towards the emergency ward, where the atmosphere was more like a police station than a hospital
 aakhirkaar ilaaj to mila lekin isse pehle ke keemtee dhai teen ghante raste main nahin balki aspataal dar aspataal bhatakane main barbaad hue
 The question was whether this happens to every patient who came from an ambulance at GB Pant
 ek baar phir ham jibi pant hi pahunche
 This time, an ambulance standing outside brought a patient referred from Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital, along with a junior resident doctor
 doctor ke peeche peeche ham bhi ward kii taraf chale
 He had talks with the doctors present here but failed to get admitted
 pataa chalaa doctor sahab ko bhi marij lekar opidi main jane ko kaha gaya
 The Delhi Police has also recently issued a circular that a fine of Rs 2000 will have to be paid if ambulances or emergency services get in the way
 jiske baad ho saktaa he marijon ko lekar ambulance vakt par aspataal tak pahunch jaae
 But the question is why a time which is precious for life on the roads becomes wasteful as soon as you reach the hospital
 sibar system or mobile jeepies ke is jamaane main kya sarkaar kisi aise centralined number kaa bandobast nahin kar sakati taaki marij ko lekar aane vaali ambulance ko aspataal dar aspataal chakkar naa kaatna pade or pehle se hi tay ho jaae ki aakhir use pahunchnaa kahaan he
 In such a situation, there will be time left, as well as the life that will not be compensated by any compensation nor by taking action on any guilty

 When Vidya Balan is given a relatively small vanity van, the people on the set know that she is not going to create any furore and will complete the shooting on her own
 vahiin shooting ke dauraan paanch ghanton ke intjaar ke baad bhi deepika ke chehre kii mohak muskaan feeki nahin padati
 This new plant is confident and knows to respect others
 ve apane seniors se seekhney ke liye taiyaar hai: pariniti apni dost deepika or bahan priyanka kii dikhaai raah par chalati hai; aalia rani mukherjee ke nakshekadam par to shraddha kapur apni chachee padmini kolhapuri ke
 They all arrive on time on set, go to the gym by the rules and complete the shots well

 Even Kangana Ranot, who came from a small town, took the iron job of acting by throwing away the simple star's costume from the problems of bitter love affair found in life
 aaj kirdaar main khud ko dhaalane kii kaabiliyat hi aapke sir par kamyaabi kaa sehara baandhti he na ki shandaar vyaktitv
 Today, the world of acting is not charismatic or flamboyant
 stars kaa jamaana gaya
 Those were the days when Bollywood veteran living in luxury was present
 sharaab or cigarette ke dhuen main nahaye utsaahi or mast shammi kapur jo ek baar pard lene ke baad kitabon se un pannon ko faad dete
 According to the facts written in Madhu Jain's book The Kapooras: The First Family of Indian Cinema, he was convinced of "manly style"
 ve buke kanvertible bhagaate or kaaron ko utani hi jaldi-jaldi badalte jitani apni premicaon ko
 He was a lover of hunting, guns and music
 ve khud ko ek mail starlet kehete
 Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt says, "when you think of the actors who lived the luxurious life of the bygone days, you remember Rajesh Khanna and Shammi Kapoor
 ” rajesh khanna kaa ghar silk ke beshkeemtee pardon se sajaa tha
 On the walls of his bedroom, he decorated his life-size pictures
 aaj ye baaten atpati lagati hai kyonki sho bijness ab suniyojit kaarobaar he
 Rajesh, who writes Rajesh Khanna with his blood, is a virgin throughout his life, weeps bitterly at his death in Anand (1997) and bites him with a full (dimple) resentment when he marries Dimple Khanna's contribution to super stardom
 film dekhne kii shaukeen devayani chaibal ne ek baar kaha tha
 Khanna is “a victim of his own image
 ” lekin aaj ke stars thik isse ulat hai
 Director Anurag Kashyap says, "this generation has heard stories of lavish and flamboyant life and they want to keep themselves beyond that
 ve jaanate hai ki film sirf achche abhinay se nahin chalati or unki mutthi main samay kaa bahut chota-sa tukdaa band he
 They are faster, more professional and more practical
 unke sir par staradam kaa nasha savaar nahin
 "kashyap says that there was a time when people thought that Rajesh Khanna sang all his songs on his own
 unhone abhi ranbir kapur ke saath ek vyast shoot puraa kiya he jinaki vinamrata, samay kii pabandi or sthiti ke anusaar khud ko dhaalane kii jabardast kshamta us guarantee se bhi zyada myne rakhti he ki ve jis film main bhi kaam karenge, vah jarur hit hogi
 Nasreen Munni Kabir, author of Conversation with Waheeda Rehman, admits that there is an encroachment of media behind the fading of the stars
 ve kahati hai, “pehle stars kii jindagi par rahasy kaa pardaa rahata tha
 But today the media and social media keep an eye on them and serve news of their moment
 ”aaj ke stars kaa jivan khuli kitaab-sa he, jabaki puraane jamaane ke stars aapaki kalpana main basate the
 The second reason is that they become part of a lot of advertisements and brands
 “aaj stars tivi par har cheez bechate najar aa rahe hai or unhen apane naam bhi de rahe hai
 Earlier artists rarely used to be part of an advertisement, so people recognized them only through screen characters
 ” koi hairaani nahin ki salmaan ne jaise hi apane liye publicist rakhaa or tivi par dikhaai dene lage, unke bandra sthit ghar ke aasapaas jam lagane vaali bheed chantane lagi
 (aditya Kapoor and Parineeti Chopra enjoying street food in Mumbai) Not much information was known about the stars earlier, so their personality would remain abuzz and ensued over the list of rumors and rumors that the magazines served as spicy
 log kirdaaron ke diwane ho jate the
 Hence Amitabh became famous as Vijay
 unhone apni anya filmon main isi se milte-julate naam istemaal kiye; khanna anand main babu moshaay ke naam se amar ho gaye, to guide (1965) kaa raju devanand kaa paryaay ban gaya
 Raj Kapoor instilled the nomadic characters of Awara (1951) and Shri 420 (1955)
 aaj abhinayta bahuaiami kirdaaron main khud ko dhaal rahe hai, ve sabhi tarah kii bhoomikaayen nibhaane ke liye taiyaar he or sakasham bhi
 Their openness is a curse and a boon for them
 prashansakon kii prakruti bhi badal rahi he
 Today, a fan wants to take as many autographs of his favorite actor or to put his poster in his room or get tattooed
 kamyaabi kii ore badhati aalia ke pita mahesh bhatta kehete hai ki uske prashansakon main chaar se chah saal ke bachche bhi hai jo unase milane aate hai
 But they agree that fans have changed
 ve kehete hai, “aaj virtual spes prashansakon kii pyaas bujh rahi he
 Nothing is secret anymore
 lekin kalakaaron kii pahunch kaa dayera bhi bada ho gaya he
 "to make him God today will be called disgrace
 aalia kaa karishma kamyaabi kii ore badaae ke liye is baat par to nirbhar karegaa hi ki ve in baton ko kis tarah leti hai, saath hi filmon main unke abhinay par bhi
 Balaji Films CEO Tanuj Garg believes that it is easy to get the star status today
 “star aaj apni shakhsiyat ko nikhaarane-sanvaarane main sakasham hai, unhen media ko sanbhaalanaa aata he, ve salahon par amal kar rahe hai or unki chhavi khaas andaaj main pesh kii ja rahi he or 30 saal pehle ke mukaable unke liye zyada aasaani se market taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The rapid emergence of new faces is good for the industry
 har koi is teji ko mahasoos karata he, zyada se zyada log profeshnal ho rahe hai, isliye hamen or adhik logon kii jarurat he
 This keeps the feet of all the people on the ground because they know whose stars are elevated tomorrow and they become stars
 ”aaj kaa sabase bindaas star ranvir singh he
 They wear bright, mismatched clothes, show off friendly with Arjun Kapoor and promote Durex condoms
 lekin stars kamobesh jo chhavi aaj bana rahe hai use is studio-production yug ke mulyon kii kasuti par samajhadaari or anushaasan mana ja rahaa he
 Many of them earn some percentage of the profits on the film's good performance
 box aphis india ke editor vajeer singh bataate hai ki aishwarya raay bachchan kaa puraa vigyaapan portpholio parivaar ko samarpit ek mahila kii shakhsiyat pesh karata haih ghadibhan, aabhushan, real estate, khaanaa pakaana or maatrutiv utpaada
 However, they have kept a safe circle around them and hence their magic is still intact
 kya star apni film kii relies par prachaar karne ke liye utrenge? production house chintit nahin kyonki unhen maaloom he ki ve aaenge hi
 But this will not be included in the list of bright headlines next morning
 aaj stars paise to kama rahe hai, lekin rahasy bharaa vah chumbakeey aakarshan kahin gum haata ja rahaa he

 haryana sarkaar kii masik patrika haryana samvaad ke ank main chapa ghunghat main dhaki ek mahila kaa photo sarkaar ke liye musiibat ban gaya he
 In fact, on the main page of the latest edition of the Haryana Dialogue, a photo of a woman standing in a veil has been placed and the slogan next to it reads "veil ki aan baan - Identity of our Haryana"
 is photo ko lekar haryana kii manohar laal sarkaar par chautarafa hamale ho rahe hai
 Government proud of the veil: The ministers of Haryana government are still maintaining that the veil is Haryana's tradition and they are proud of their tradition
 haryana ke shiksha mantri ramvilas sharma ne kaha ki haryana kii betiyaan puure vishwa main apana paracham laharaa rahi hai lekin iskaa katai ye matlab nahin he ki haryana ke log apni parampara ko bhul gaye hai
 The veil is part of the Haryana tradition and the government of Haryana and Haryana as a whole is proud of the veil tradition
 baikfoot par khatter sarkarharyana sarkaar kii sarkari magazine haryana samvaad ke cover pej par ghunghat ko haryana kii aan baan or shaan bataane ko lekar haryana sarkaar baikfoot par he
 When the Chief Minister of Haryana Manohar Lal Khattar was asked to clarify in this magazine about the orthodox tradition of Haryana, he refused to be aware of the matter and said that he will soon gather information about this and make this magazine will see
 slogan galatamahila adhikaron or mahilaon ke sangrakshan ke liye kaam karne vaali mahilaon or sanghathanon ne sarkaar ko aade haathon lete hue "ghunghat haryana kii shaan" slogan ko bilkul galat tehraaya he
 Women and girls say that on one hand the government is giving the slogan of "beti Bachao Beti Padhao" on the one hand, on the other hand it is trying to keep the woman in the veil
 haryana ke jind ke bibipur gaanv joki "beti bachaao beti padhaao" or "selfi vid doctor" jaise abhiyaanon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 The women there say that if they want to become Kalpana Chawla and Sania Mirza then how will they remain under the veil
 jind kii nari shakti kaa ye bhi kahana he kii khatter sarkaar ko is slogan ko turant waapas lenaa chahie
 Former sarpanch of Bibipur village of Jind, who runs the Sabla program to end the veil system in his village and nearby villages, says that action should be taken against the department officials who have given this slogan
 sunil ke anusaar ek ore haryana kii betiyaan femina miss india or dabludeblooi main apana paracham laharaa rahi hai duusari ore is tarah ke slogan peedaadaayak hai
 The Congress has also attacked the Haryana government for slogan of the official magazine of keeping the women under the veil
 congress kaa kahana he ki ek ore to sarkaar "beti bachaao beti padhaao" jaise abhiyaan chalaane kaa daawa karke vaahvahee luutane main lagi he or vahiin duusari ore naariyon ke ghunghat main chhipe rahane ko apni shaan bataa kar apni sankeern maansikta kaa udhaaharan bhi de rahi he
 The Congress says that there is a difference between the words and actions of the government and what the government is thinking about improving the condition of women and their condition has been made clear by the slogan written on this magazine of the government
 vahiin sarkaar kii kirakiri hone ke baad is magazine ko nikaalane vaale public relation department kii mantri kavita jain to puri tarah se chuppi saadhe hue hai
 But Haryana's Fire Brand Minister Anil Vij, who has always protected the government from his statements, does not even have the answer to the question whether the Haryana government is proud of the Veil Kohriana? And isn't the government in favor of ending the veil? When Anil Vij was asked about this whole issue, he started to cry on the traditions, but in the name of tradition, he had no answer on how the government could put its narrow mindset in front of the women and that was a chuckle
 Started answering kai barharyana sarkaar"beti bachaao beti padhaao" jaise abhiyaanon or apni sarkaar ke vakt pradesh main ladakiyon ke sudhare linganupaat kii duhai dekar apni qamar thapthapaati rahati he lekin asal main sarkaar ke mantriyon or adhikariyon ke man main mahilaon ke prati kya soch he wo is sarkari patrika ke mukhpatr par chapa vigyaapan or ghunghat ko shaan bataane vaala sarkari slogan bayaan kar rahaa he

 "it was a historic decision and surprisingly, there was no response from them," he said
 is mudde par raajnneeti na karen
 His colleague and West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh also questioned Mamata's silence
 haalanki aisa bhi nahin tha ki didi ne koi pratikriya hi nahin di
 To make his point, he chose his pen and said whatever he wanted to say, through a poem titled 'unseed (avyakta)'
 ''aksar bahut kuch kaha ja saktaa hamaun rahakar
 Saying nothing is often a more powerful expression than saying something
 
 
 ''duusari ore, congress kaary samiti ne faisle ke din ek chota-sa note jari karne kaa faisla kiya
 It states, "the Indian National Congress respects the decision of the Supreme Court in the Ayodhya case
" ham sabhi sambandhit pakshon or sabhi samudaayon se samvidhan main varnit dharmanirpeksh mulyon or bhaichaare kii bhaavana kaa paalan karne or shanti tathaa sadbhaav banaae rakhane kii apil karte hai

 ''faisle par vipakshi dalon kii nappi-tuli pratikriya bahusankhyak samudaay se jude muddon par baat karte samay unki rajnatik ranneetiyon main badlaav kaa sanket detii he
 The polarization of Hindu votes has benefited the BJP in several elections, while allegations of minority appeasement have been hit by opposition parties
 vastav main, congress ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye naram hindutv kaa sahaara liya
 Party President Rahul Gandhi was going to the temple-temple and Janudehari was claiming to be a devotee of Shiva
 yah alag baat he ki hindu voton par bhaajapa ke ekadhikaar ke daawey ko rokane kii unki koshishon kaa kuch khaas nateeja nahin niklaa
 The only outspoken political opposition to the decision was All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) President Asaduddin Owaisi
 musalamaanon kii raajnneeti karne vaale ovaisi ne ayodhya ke faisle ko 'tathyon par aasthaa kii jeet' qaraar diya
 The verdict from the left parties was also seen in a very taut language and very mild criticism
 communist party of india (marxvaadi) ke ek bayaan main kaha gaya, ''is faisle ne is vivaadit mudde kaa ek nyaayik samaadhaan to pradaan kiya he, lekin nirnay ke kuch tathy aise hai jin par sawaal bhi khadey hote hai
 "the political peace after the Ayodhya verdict may actually be a cause for concern for the BJP
" dashakon se chal rahe vivaad kaa samaadhaan ho jane se iskaa ek aisa chunavi mudda khatm ho gaya he jo 1990 ke dashak se har chunaav main party ke ghoshnaptr kaa hissaa rahaa he
 In fact, the saffron party is trying to create an election narrative for the 2021 assembly elections in West Bengal
 bhaajapa is purvi garh ko jeetne kii ranneeti 'jai shri ram' ke naare ke aasapaas rachane ko betaab he
 In the May elections this year, the bjp-led NDA returned to power with a thumping majority and after its defeat, Mamata lost her temper publicly seeing the slogans of 'jai Shri Ram' and this made the BJP sit - Made an issue
 bhaajapa ne aam chunaav main rajya kii loksabhaa kii 42 main se 18 siten hasil kin, jabaki sattarudh trinmul congress kaa pradarshan gira or usne 2014 main jahaan 34 siten jiti thim, vah sankhya paanch saal baad ghatakar 22 rah gai
 On the advice of the election loser and election strategist Prashant Kishore, she is now avoiding fighting horns with the BJP on any matter related to Lord Ram
 iske bajaae, unhone apane vidhayakon ke pradarshan kii kadi nigaraanee shuru kii he or sabhi ko matadaataaon ke liye adhik sulabh hone kaa nirdesh diya he
 All the mlas have been ordered to spend 10 nights in the villages of their constituencies by the end of December

 They are slowly realizing that Modi's magic, Hindutva and nationalism may not be enough to win elections to the BJP in the states
 rajya sarkaron kaa pradarshan, sthaneey mudde or vipaksh kaa abhiyaan matdaan pratishat ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 The Indian economy is in a critical state and opposition parties want the focus to remain on it so that the BJP does not get a chance to use the Ayodhya verdict to polarize Hindu votes
 shaayad isiilie dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal, jinhen agle saal kii shuruyaat main chunaavon kaa saamana karnaa hoga, ne faisle kaa swaagat karne or logon se shanti banaae rakhane kii apil karne main koi samay nahin ganvaaya
 Whatever be the Ayodhya verdict will surely add to the achievements of Narendra Modi's account

 In the last session of Parliament, making triple talaq a criminal act is seen as the beginning of bjp's journey towards the Uniform Civil Code, which is the third important agenda in the list of actions proposed by the RSS-BJP
 in kaaryon ne narendra modi ke kad main kai guna ijapha kiya he or iske saamne desh ke saamne mandaraata aarthik sankat kaa gambhir prashn bhi haashie par najar aata he
 After the Ayodhya verdict, not a single RSS worker has spoken about Kashi or Mathura, indicating that modi-shah has instilled complete trust in the RSS family to reach his political priorities
 ek rajnatik vishleshak ajay umat, jinhone in varshon main modi ke badhate kad par gahari najar banaae rakhi he, kaa maananaa he ki ayodhya kaa faisla unke kad ko or badhayega
 He says, "after the talk of asserting a legal solution instead of taking the constitutional path to resolve the Ayodhya dispute, along with his appeal to the nation not to see the verdict as a defeat or victory, the verdict His success in keeping the RSS under control later, shows that he possesses the abilities of a skilled politician

 '' phir bhi, modi ne ab tak jo kuch bhi hasil kiya he, vah bekaar sabit ho saktaa he, agar ve lagaataar girti bhartiya arthvyavastha ko bachaa nahin sake
 The electoral gains that the Prime Minister and his party have received to change the history of India will soon begin to move like a sand from their fists if the period of decline in GDP continues, the shortage of jobs continues and successive successive years
 The sectors continued to collapse
 kashmir masale kaa hal nikaala ja chukaa he, ayodhya main mandir kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he, philhal unke paas aisa koi bada mudda nahin he jo sahaara de sake
 No comment Didi responded through lines of poetry, while Congress and Kejriwal supported the decision

 It is to be noted that on April 24 this year, Phoolan formed the Eklavya Sena Committee
