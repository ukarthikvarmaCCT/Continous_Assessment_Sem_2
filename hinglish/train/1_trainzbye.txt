 What would you call it - Khissiani Cat Khamba Noche, or Ahmed Bukhari
 yah to mana ja saktaa he ki haar kii kasak main koi kuch bhi bol saktaa he, lihaaja yah maan liya jaae ki unhone dilli kii sabase badi masjid ke vivaadaaspad imam bukhari kaa maan badhaayaa he
 Bukhari appealed to the Aam Aadmi Party to vote
 party ne saaf taur par unka samarthan lene se inkaar kar diya tha or vivaadaaspad imam kii apil par khud musalmaan bhi dang rah gaye the
 The job of the Imams is to offer namaz in the mosque and to give Urdu and religious education to the children in their free time
 masjid kii sthaneey cametiyon ne imaamon-muajjinon kii selary tay kar rakhi he, jisase kisi tarah unka ghar chal jaataa he
 Even in most Islamic countries, they are limited to teaching Namaz only
 saudi arab kii do badi masjidon ke imam bhi koi apwaad nahin hai
 Sometimes governments give directions for what the Imam will say and not say in the mosque, as has happened in Egypt
 lihaaja, imam kaa kaam simit he
 Most people in the community have little doubt
 phir imam bukhari kii itani ahmiyat kaise? bedi jaisi netaaon ne hameshaa se bukhari kaa maan badhaayaa he
 To equalize the statements of staunch Hindu leaders in the media, Bukhari was made a leader, to say that on the one hand there is Praveen Togadia, Sakshi Maharaj or Yogi Adityanath, on the other, there is Bukhari
 darasal, baat baraabar nahin hui kyonki togdipha, sakshi yaa adityanath kaa janaadhar ho saktaa he, par bukhari kaa katai nahin he
 By the way, Bukhari has been trying to prove himself as 'imam-e-hind' (leader of Hindustan), but Allama Iqbal gave this status to Lord Ram long ago, and no one can take his place in this country
 
 bukhari kaa itnaa bhi janaadhar nahin he ki ve apane ilaake main kisi vidhayak ko jita saken
 Many people, including Sheeba Aslam Fallahi or Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan, who live in Jama Masjid area, can testify this
 yah sthiti pichley do dashak se zyada se he
 He has appealed to almost every party, including BJP, in protest
 hakeekat to yah he ki samudaay ke logon par bukhari kii siyaasi apil kaa ulataa asar hota he
 They begin to think that Bukhari has met someone again and will deal with the community
 aise main yah bhi to ho saktaa he ki bukhari ke bayaan se kiran bedi ke vot bad gaye hon
 But Bedi increased Bukhari's value with his statement
 vaise, unhone ek sahi mudda uthaaya he- imaamon kii siyaasi apil par roak lagani chahie
 Also, babas, saints, religious leaders etc
 should also be stopped from doing so
 yah baba ram rahim or baba ramdev par bhi lagu hota he
 Jamaluddin Khan, brother of the alleged rape accused who was beaten to death by a mob in Dimapur, Nagaland, has claimed that the woman who lodged a rape FIR against his brother, medical reports revealed any such incident with her
 Did not come vahiin kathith rape peedita ne bhi bayaan diya he ki puri ghatana ke baad use shant rahane ke liye rupayon kii peshkash kii gai
 The victim told NDTV, 'the accused was my neighbor
 
 
 usne mujhe munh band rakhane ke liye 5000 rupee die
 
 
 i took those money and gave it to the police station
 ' Recalling the incident, she says, 'on the night of 23 February, the second accused in the case called me to eat snacks
 usne mujhe bataaya ki vah akelaa tha, isliye main uske paas chali gai
 Arriving there, i saw another person with him
 is par maine jane se manaa kar diya, lekin usne mujhase kaha ki jab main uske saath hum tab sab kuch thik he
 ' iske saath hi usne bataaya, 'thodi der baad vah sahaaaropee apane kisi dost milane ke liye vahaan se chalaa gaya
 
 
 After this, the main accused turned on his car and took me to a hotel room, where he raped me twice
 ' However, Jamaluddin Khan, the brother of the accused in the case, while talking to NDTV, alleged that Naga organizations implicated his brother Syed Sharifuddin Khan and made him a 'scapegoat'
 unhone police ko bhi kathghare main khadaa karte hue kaha ki vah ghatana ke vakt haath par haath dhare baithe rahi
 Jamaluddin Khan said, 'is the Nagaland government running Jungle Raj? The girl who lodged the FIR seems to be the sister of my brother's wife in the relationship
 nagaland police bhi yah kah chuki he ki medical report main balaatkaar kii pushti nahin hui he
 ' jamaluddin ne kaha ki mere parivaar se kai log sena main hai, vah use bangladeshi kahkar kaise maar sakate hai? mere bhai ko bali kaa bakra banaaya gaya
 He said that he and another brother of his, Kamal Khan, are currently in the Assam Regiment of the Indian Army
 unke ek or bhai, imamuddin khan bhi sena main the or 1999 kii kargil ladaai main shahid ho gaye the
 His father, Syed Hussain Khan, retired from the Indian Air Force and his mother is currently receiving his pension
 jamaluddin khan ne daawa kiya ki unka parivaar assam ke karimganj jile kaa rahane vaala he
 In this whole case, many questions are seen standing together
 sawaal saiyad sharifuddin khan ko aaropee banaae jane ko lekar bhi he ki aakhir kis medical report ke aadhaar par unhen ek naga mahila se rape kaa aaropee banaaya gaya
 Questions are also being raised about where the victim is going to live and on what basis the police initially claimed that Syed Sharifuddin Khan is a Bangladeshi living illegally
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko, saiyad sharifuddin khan ko bheed ne peet-petakar maar daalaa tha
 Sharifuddin, who was lodged in Dimapur's Central Jail on charges of rape, was taken out by an angry mob of two thousand people and paraded in a naked state
 bheed unhen dam nikalne tak maarthi rahi or uske baad clock tower se unki laash taang di
 Naga civil society has condemned the incident but also attacked the offices of the central and state government
 sanghathan ne aarope lagaaya ki donon hi sarkarein avaidh rup se kshetra main rah rahe bangladeshiyon ko lekar laaparvaah hai
 It was also said that the suspect Syed Sharifuddin was an illegal Bangladeshi
 naga council ke mahasachiv joel naga ne kaha, 'assam sarkaar kii vot bank policy se ham gusse main hai

 shiv sena ke adhyaksh uddhav thakare ne sanket die hai ki agar raaj thakare dil se unase haath milaanaa chahen to unhen koi aapatti nahin he
 It seems from this statement that Uddhav and Raj Thackeray, who choose different paths in politics, will be together
 shiv sena ke mukhpatr saamana main teen kadiyon main die saakshaatkaar kii duusari kadi buudhvaar ko prakashit hui he
 From what Uddhav has said in it, it is clear that if Raj wishes, he has no hesitation in joining hands
 uddhav ke mutabik, 'agar koi dil se hamaare paas aata he to main uskaa swaagat karuunga
 In this interview, Uddhav has said many things that seem to have softened his stand on Raj Thackeray and if Raj extends his hand, Uddhav can hold him back
 uddhav se jab sawaal poocha gaya ki kya shivasena or emenes saath aaenge? to uddhav kaa jawaab tha, 'tali ek haath se nahin bajati
 'that is, if Raj takes the initiative, then the doors of possibilities of both coming together are open
 isi sawaal ko jab dobaaraa poocha gaya ki kya wo saath aaenge to uddhav ne kaha, 'aap sirf mujhase ye sawaal kaise kar sakate? main jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar hum lekin aapako ham donon ko saath bithakar ye sawaal karnaa chahie
 It depends on both sides
 'raaj ko lekar uddhav ke badale rukh kaa ishaara unke ek or jawaab se bhi miltaa he jisamen wo marathi vot bank ke bantwaare ke liye akele emenes ko jimmedaar nahin maanate
 It is clear from Uddhav's talk that he has no hesitation in joining hands with Raj, but for this, Raj will also have to take a step
 saakshaatkaar main ek jawaab main unki ye uljhan jaahir bhi hoti he jisamen wo kehete hai, 'main is sawaal kaa jawaab abhi de saktaa hum lekin kya pataa agar unke dimag main kuch or baaten hon
 'significantly, when Uddhav fell ill last year, Raj kept going to the hospital constantly to know his condition
 wo apni car se uddhav ko ghar par chhodane bhi gaye the
 Then there was speculation about the two getting closer

 'saamana' main unhone saaf kar diya tha ki shiv sena main abhi dam baaki he
 In his interview, Uddhav warned all opponents, including MNS

 Referring to a decision taken during the earlier SP government, he said that it was decided in the SP government that unless there are four engineering colleges in every district of the state, then permission to open a new engineering college in Noida Will not be granted, but the previous government changed this decision
 unhone ummid jataai ki aane vaale samay main echsiel ke alaava anya iti companiyaan bhi pradesh ke vikaas main ruchi dikhaaengi
 The Chief Minister said that to overcome the backwardness of the state, a lot of work is being done in basic areas like roads, electricity, irrigation

 The Chief Minister asked the officials to ensure the real solution to the problems of the people at the grassroots level using information technology (IT)

 Significantly, Najeeb Jung, in his interview, had alleged that he had benefited Satyendar Jain's daughter and wrongly appointed Kejriwal's relative Nikunj Garg

 The film is directed by Siddharth Anand
 yah film tom krooj-camerun diaj kii 'nite and de' kaa aadhikarik rimek he jo 2 oktober ko relies hogi
 For Hrithik Roshan, who is going through a difficult period in his personal life, this film is very important

 Hrithik's action avatar will be seen in this film

 Once again, fans will expect great performance from this pair of 'zindagi Na Milegi Dobara'
 vahiin box offis pandit bhi yahi anumaan laga rahe hai ki yah film saare record todane main kaamyaab hogi i had such a relationship with mother in Teenage that even if she was saying the right thing, i felt that she had no work except to give a lecture
 aapane ne bhi kabhi na kabhi apni maa ke saath takaraar kaa, gusse kaa or kabhi-kabhi to kai din tak baat na karne vaala rishta jarur banaaya hoga lekin tinej ke baad jab samaj aane lagati he to maa dhire-dhire dost banane lagati hai
 This is how a mother-daughter relationship fights, love and support each other
 aisa hi ek aid aajkal you-tub par khub dekha ja rahaa he
 How a daughter is jealous of the mother's grace and then begins a period of misunderstanding and then one day something happens that all the anger of the daughter comes on the mother
 lekin sahi kehete hai kima se zyada uske bachche ko koi nahin samajhasakta he or aisa hi hota he is kahani main bhi
 The mother lovingly and caresses her daughter, explaining that this happens at her age, but if she does not talk to him openly, things will not go wrong
 isiilie to kehete hai ki apni maa kii baat maanane main hi bhalaai hoti he kyonki maa beti kii sabase acchhee dost hoti he

 The Mahasabha has shied away from its core responsibilities and is only getting entangled in the processes, it only talks idealized rather than in leadership or concrete action
 '' laal ne kaha ki mahasabha vaishvik sansad se ''kaaphi had tak milti julati'' he lekin isaki bhoomika or adhikaar ''suraksha parishad kii lagaataar vyapak hoti bhoomika or sakriyata ke kaaran'' lagaataar kam kiye ja rahe hai

 "we need to work together to reestablish the superiority of the world body so that the General Assembly can become the main policy-making body," Lal said during the February 20 session
 '' unhone jor dekar kaha ki sanyukt raashtra par bharosa tab tak phir se kaayam nahin ho saktaa, jab tak isamen is tarah sudhaar nahin kiya jaae ki yah samakaleen vaastaviktaaon ko pratibimbit kare
 Lal said that although the progress of revival of the General Assembly is slow and very low, the changes in the selection process of the General Secretary are "encouraging"

 Then suddenly the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and Urban Development in SP Government Azam Khan flew towards Delhi on a special mission
 ve sidhe raashtrapati bhawan pahunche or raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke saamne rajyapal kii shikayaton kaa pitara khol diya
 He appealed to the President to take a strong judgment after taking Naik's 'absurd' statements into consideration
 takreeban 20 minute se kuch zyada samay raashtrapati bhawan main gujaarne ke baad ajam khan der shaam lakhanu laut aae
 But the example of a minister who complained directly to the President about the Governor, no other example exists in UP politics
 jansangh se raajnneeti kaa safar shuru karne vaale ram nik centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main petroleum or prakritik gas mantri rah chuke hai
 On July 22 last year, after assuming the post of the Governor of UP, there were many such occasions and issues when he expressed his stand contrary to the attitude of the Government (see box)
 cabinet mantri ajam khan rajbhavan or sarkaar ke bich hue takaraav kii ek ahm kadi rahe hai
 At present, the reason for this dispute of Azam Khan was to raise objection to the government's decision to give Naik's 'mohammad Ali Johar Trust' in Rampur the building of 'johar Research Institute'
 iske baad ajam ne 11 farvari ko nik ko chaar panne kaa lanbaa patr likhakar yah jaahir karne kii koshish kii ki unki karypranali se musalamaanon main kaaphi bhay paidaa ho rahaa he
 The altercation between the two began last year
 darasal, rajyapal ne ajam khan ke us bayaan par kadaa etraj jataayaa tha, jisamen unhone rampur main mulaayam singh yadav ke janmdiwas samaaroh main kharch hone vaala paisa taliban or daud ibrahim jaisi desh virdohi takaton se milane kii baat kahi thi
 This thing was said in front of the media as a taunt

 ve rampur ke moulana mohammad ali johar vishvavidhyalay ko alpsankhyak santhaan kaa darja dilaanaa chaahate the or rajyapal is par aapatti kar rahe the
 However, in July last year, Aziz Qureshi, who was governor for some time, had good relations with Azam and Johar University got minority status
 vartmaan main mizoram ke rajyapal kii jimmedaari nibhaa rahe ajij kuraishi kehete hai, ''jab main upi kaa rajyapal tha to rajbhavan main siyasat ko haaavee nahin hone diya tha
 Ram Naik and Azam should sit together and settle the dispute
 ''rajyapal banane ke baad se nik kii sakriyata ne jahaan ek ore kai vivaadon ko janm diya he, vahiin duusari ore kuch aisi nai paramparaon kii bhi shuruyaat kii he, jinhone rajbhavan ko ek nai pahchaan di he
 Perhaps this was the reason why in the national convention last year, the SP had strongly objected to the manner in which Governor Naik acted as Chief Minister in his political proposal
 nai paramparaon par khinchatanpichley saal july main rajyapal kaa daayitv sanbhaalane ke baad se ram nik ne turant rajyapal padnaam ke saath 'mahamahim' yaa 'hij excelency' shabd ke istemaal par roak laga di thi
 The word 'honorable' or 'honorable' is now used in their place
 yahi nahin, unhone pehali baar rajbhavan se baqayada press conference kar apane kaamkaaj kaa byora dena shuru kiya
 Their methods have become the center of criticism among opposition parties

 BSP National President Mayawati said, "on the beginning of the new tradition of Governor through press conference, the President or the Central Government must take cognizance that it is right and wrong
 itnaa jarur he ki isse sapa sarkaar kii kamajori jaahir ho rahi he
 "on the other hand, political analysts are justifying the Governor's move to a certain extent

 The Raj Bhavan in the role of a Panch The situation between the Center and the state government worsened due to the lack of coal in the last summer when the power houses of UP were groaning
 kendriya koyala mantri piyush goyal mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav par baatcheet na karne kii tohamat laga rahe the to mukhyamantri centre sarkaar par bhedbhaav kaa aarope

 Naik got Varanasi Mayor Ram Gopal Mohale and Akhilesh Yadav face-to-face on December 18 last year and got the bottlenecks in the development of the city
 mohale kehete hai, ''rajyapal sabhi netaaon ke saamne apni baat badi vinamrata se rakhte hai or isi vajah se unhen sabakaa samarthan mil rahaa he
 In his speech during the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Electricity Regulatory Commission building in Lucknow on September 29 last year, Naik was asked to ask that the building be ready in 2016, "how much time is left for the next election?" Yadav understood the intent of the question and said while sitting on the stage, "if you have my blessings, i will be CM till 2017
 '' nik ne palatwaar karte hue kaha, ''acha he, tab tak main bhi rahoonga or aap bhi rahenge
 The clash between the Raj Bhavan and the government is well known
 lekin yah bhi tay he ki agar samvidhan ke daayre main rahakar sarkaar or rajbhavan ne apni-apni jimmedaari nahin nibhaai to 2017 tak paraspar takaraav bhi nae sopan chadhega
 It's all OK when it's DK https: / / t
 co / rxd9vdbawe It is foolish to think that an institution called Lokpal will root out corruption of all kinds
 isaki tah tak jaaen to tasviir bhayaavah dikhti he
 If there is a slight omission in the vigilance, then the Lokpal can also adopt a satanic form in the crowd of institutions
 hakeekat kii jameen par ek majboot lokapal ko saakaar karnaa samanaantar sarkaar kii neenv rakhane ke baraabar he
 Suppose the Lokpal receives 10 lakh complaints every year in relation to the 60 lakh employees of the central government, then according to this a huge need for human resources and financial expenditure will be revealed, and also to eliminate corruption
 a new plant of corruption will begin to grow within the organization
 public interest foundation naam kii ek swayamsevi sanstha ne artiai aavednon ke jariye jaankaree jutai he ki adhiktar lokayuktaon ke paas teen saal se bhi puraane hajaaron maamle lambit hai
 In these cases, the figures of investigation, hearing and punishment are also not better
 azim premaji foundation kii ore se kiye gaye shodh main pataa chalaa he ki karnataka ke lokayukta ke upar bhrashtachar se judi shikayaton kaa itnaa boj he ki paanch saal puraane maamalon kii sunwaayee bhi puri nahin ho saki he
 Even in which the hearing has been completed, the punishment rate is very poor there
 iske alaava shikayaton kii sachaai parakhe bagaiyr unhen sweekaar kar liya jaataa he, lihaaja iske liye bane vishisht staff kaa kaaphi vakt jaaya hota he
 The figures relating to disposal of appeals in the office of the Chief Election Commissioner also tell the same story
 isliye yah sochna ki jan lokapal vidheyak sari samasyaon kaa iklauta samaadhaan he, maamle kaa sarleekaran hoga
 This will neither improve the system nor improve the administrative institutions
 hamen yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki ek majboot lokapal ko lekar kahin utsaah ke chakkar main ham vidhayika, nyaaypalika or karypalika ke bich samvidhan kii check and balance pranali se kaayam najuk santulan ko nuksaan to nahin pahunchaa rahe
 The basic principle of democracy is decentralization of forces and not its centralization in a single institution
 loktantr main sansad kii sarvocchata ko mana gaya he
 Full autonomy for the Lokpal and bringing institutions like CBI and CVC under its ambit is nothing more than establishing a second bureaucracy
 ek majboot lokapal ko sibiai, sivisi or nyaaypalika par ankushrahit nigaraanee kaa adhikaar dena jaruri nahin he
 The matters of investigation, hearing, disciplinary punishment, confiscation of assets and even granting of quasi-judicial powers in the hands of the employees of the Lokpal institution are the subject of debate
 lokapal ko vibhinn sansthaanon kii nigaraanee kaa kaam dena use super daaroga (supercop) banane jaisaa hoga
 During the debate on the influential Lokpal, we have ignored the almost stalled process of decision making
 eemaandaar afasaron ko nirnay karne se hatotsahit karne sambandhi koi bhi kadam rashtriya hit ko chot pahunchayegaa
 Policy decisions are always made based on certain corroborated facts
 janhit ko chot pahunchane vaala koi bhi kadam nirnay prakriya ko thap kar degaa
 For example, this type of theory can also raise questions about the liberal measures in tax administration or the fees fixed after restructuring
 hamen is tathy ko nazarandaaj nahin karnaa chahie ki koi locasevak utana hi deshbhakt hota he jitna civil sosayadi apane bare main daawa karti he
 We must remember that any degree of mistrust or doubt over him will erode the credibility of the institutions and its executives who have been given specific judicial powers by the Constitution
 sakasham vyaktiyon ko sanvaidhanik or vaidhanik sansthaaon ke sheersh par baitaane main hi samaadhaan nihit he
 The Ombudsman should have the authority to investigate, hear and take appropriate action, but he should do this with the help of his staff and allied institutions
 lokapal ko kuch purv paribhaashit samhitaon or siddhanton ke tahat parisampattiyon kii padtaal or jabti kaa adhikaar diya ja saktaa he
 The ombudsman should have autonomy in terms of his mode of work, administrative and financial rights so that he can center himself on complaints against senior bureaucrats and politicians
 kanoonee or sanvaidhanik pahaluon main jhanke bagaiyr lokapal vidheyak ko paarit karnaa jaldbaaji hogi, jab tak ki rajya stareey lokayuktaon ke gathan kaa praavdhaan puraa na kar liya jaae
 The Lokayukta has been formed in many states
 is babat uttarakhand kii khandudi sarkaar ne haal hi main jo kanoon paarit kiya he, vah saraahneey he
 This law can become an example for those states where there are no Lokayuktas yet
 hamen santulit lokapal vidheyak kii jarurat he or iskaa vakt bhi aa chukaa he
 The delay in this will go against the wave created in its favor across the country

 ‚Äô‚Äô a law student was shot dead in Burari area of delhi
 isse pehle chaatr apane do saathiyon ke saath tahalne niklaa tha
 Then a man riding a bike started abusing him
 jab un logon ne us bike savaar ko rokane kii koshish kii to usne goli chalaa di
 The deceased student has been identified as Ashish Bhardwaj
 jisaki umr 24 saal he
 The deceased student was originally from Bihar
 vah gudgaanv kii ek privet uniwarsity se lau kar rahaa tha
 He used to live on rent in Jharoda of Burari police station area
 guuruuvaar kii raat ashish apane do doston ke saath sadak par tahal rahaa tha
 The three students were walking along the drain near the ring road
 achaanak nashe main dhut ek shaks bike par savaar hokar aayaa or teenon students ko gaali galoch karne laga
 He carried a double gun leg on his shoulder
 chaatro ne use samajhane kii koshish kii to vah unhen goli maarane kii dhamkee dene laga
 After this, both of Ashish's companions caught the person
 tabhi us shaks ne apni bandook se goli chalaa di
 Which went directly to Ashish Bhardwaj's neck
 vah lahooluhaan hokar vahiin sadak par gir padaa
 Her colleagues sought help from several autos and vehicles to take the injured Ashish to the hospital
 magar koi nahin rukaa
 On the dark road in the fog, the two boys kept pointing their hands to stop the vehicles, but no one stopped the car there for fear of looting
 tab tak ashish kaa kaaphi khun bah chukaa tha
 He was rushed to the hospital about fifteen minutes after being shot
 jahaan ilaaj ke dauraan ashish keemautaho gai
 People around say that the police does not patrol in this area
 isliye aedin yahaan lutpaat hona aam baat he
 The road on which these students went to roam in the dark at eleven o'clock
 vahaan koi street lite bhi nahin he
 At present, the Burari police station has taken possession of the body and sent it for postmortem
 ab police yah pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he ki bike par aayaa hamalavar koun tha
 Also, whether the biker's story is true or the matter is something else
 police kai angel se maamle jaanch kar rahi he
 On the very next day of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's refusal to support the Third Front, BJP leader Arun Jaitley said that people should choose either the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) or one of a 'chaotic alliance' Will happen
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki vampanthi partiyaan khandit janadesh chaahati hai, taaki ve teesraa morcha khadaa kar saken
 He indicated that the Congress's regional rivals would themselves become allies of the NDA
 jetali ne apane blog main ravivaar ko kaha, 'rahul gandhi ne spasht rup se kaha he ki unki party tisare morche ko samarthan nahin karegi
 The 'BJP leader has questioned,' the Left is hoping for a fractured mandate
 unki purajor koshish he ki waisi sthiti main har koi endie ko satta se baahar rakhane kii koshish karegaa
 Will it include the Trinamool Congress and the Left or will the Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party, DMK and AIADMK board a boat? ‚Äùhe said,‚Äú Those who are alive in the name of Gar Congress in their state will join Congress in Delhi Being surrounded will be seen in difficulty
 yadi ve dilli main congress kaa saath dete hai, to ve apana congress virdohi janaadhar bijepi ke haathon kho denge
 ' punjab ke jirakapur main garmi se bhari ek subah ko ek farmahouse ke bade se maidan main baahar se jhaankne par ek alag hi duniya kaa najaara dikhaai detaa he
 If you look closely, you will feel that you have reached directly to Rio de Janeiro, especially in the Olympic shooting center of this most famous city on the northwestern side of Brazil
 or taarikh, maan lijie 8 agast, 2016 kii subah
 There you see Abhinav Bindra, India's only individual Olympic gold medalist, who seems to have a picture of wordlessness in the backdrop of a green field
 ve vahaan 10 meter kii duuri par bane chote-se gol gheron par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 You watch them silently aiming continuously, and are afraid to take a single word out of their mouths so that their concentration does not get disturbed
 kai maheenon se bindra apane is farmahouse ke jariye olympic ke maidan tak pahunchane ke liye gupt maarg kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 And the reality, which though not looking as spectacular, is definitely inspiring
 bindra jab 2015 main taiyaariyon ko parakhane vaale ek aayojan ke liye rio gaye the to unhone vahaan har kone se shooting range kii tasviren khinchi thim or un tasveeron ko apni maa bubbly ko bhej diya tha
 By the time he returned from Rio, his mother had transformed his private shooting range built in the back garden of his house into a shooting range in Rio, so that when he shot there ‚Äî his second Olympics For gold - they feel as if they are at home
 lekin har athlete ko bindra kii tarah janm se hi itani suvidhaayen hasil hone kaa saubhaahgya nahin praapt he
 Nevertheless, every Indian player going to Rio to participate in the Olympics is full of enthusiasm to the point of madness and is busy preparing himself physically and mentally
 agar pahalwaan yogeshwar dutt, jinhone 2012 ke landan olympic main kaansya padak jeeta tha, ek aise kamare main din main paanch ghante abhyaas karke apana damakham badhaane main lage hai, jiskaa taapmaana pahaad kii oonchai par sthit jagah ke taapmaana jaisaa he, to deepa karmaakar, jo olympic ke liye kwalifoi karne vaali pehali bhartiya mahila jimnast hai, ne khud ko dilli ke indira gandhi indoor stadium main kaid kar rakhaa he
 This time, the team of 121 Indian players going to participate in the Olympics is completely different from any team that went to the previous Olympic events
 aap is dal ke athleton se baat karen to paaenge ki pichley aath varshon‚Äîtabhi se jab se beijing main bindra ne subah-subah itihaas rachaa tha‚Äîmain in khiladinnon ke sochane ke tareeke main kitna bada badlaav aa chukaa he
 They are not just hoping to get any medal, but now they have the passion to win the gold medal directly
 bhale hi ve swarna padak jitate hai, yaa nahin, yah baat ab koi myne nahin rakhti he
 The real thing is that now they think, they can win, they are not just a losing contestant, they are not just going to complete the count, they are doing everything possible to fulfill their dream there- This is being seen for the first time in the field of Indian sport
 ve din lad gaye jab bharatiyon ko har chaar saal baad yah sachaai yaad aati thi ki ve olympic main hissaa lene ja rahe hai
 It has always been the same story: a three-week mourning, which coincidentally turned into a rush of medals, and then we waited to repeat the same story at the next Olympics
 jeene kaa yah tarika acha tha‚Äîsukhad or suvidhajanak, bhale hi vah kitna hi neeras kyon na ho
 When you do not expect something, something usually goes hand in hand
 is tarah ekaadh padak lekar ham khel ke naam par cricket kii deewangi liye hue chupchaap laut aate the or jindagi pehle kii tarah chalati rahati thi
 In the meantime, there were frequent visits from sports administrators, scandals of corruption, horoscopes as presidents on sports associations for decades, while listening to stories of our athletes struggling to keep up
 Used to get unhen hotalon kii jagah laavaaris pade rail ke dibbon main rahane ko kaha jaataa tha, unhen buniyadi koching tak nahin muhaiyaa karai jaati thi or cricket ke superstaron kii tulana main unke saath duusare darje ke nagarikon kii tarah vyavhaar kiya jaataa tha
 The Olympic Games in India were stuck in a vicious cycle, where the name of the athlete came into the limelight only when he achieved some dramatic success in international competitions, which was very difficult, because he needed to succeed
 Facilities were not provided
 lekin pichley do olympic se bharat ke lambey samay se dabe-kuchle athlete maamle ko apane haathon main lene main kaamyaab rahe hai or sthiti kaaphi had tak badal chuki he
 After returning three medals from Beijing and six medals from London, he has caught the attention of the country of neglect so far
 bhartiya khel praadhikaran (esai) ke sonipat sthit centre main kushti ke haul main yuva khiladinnon ne susheel kumaar or yogeshwar dutt kii tasviren laga rakhi hai
 They practice in front of the pictures of these wrestling players to achieve success like them
 unke nayakon ne lagbhag ajey baadhaon kaa saamana karte hue unhen paar kiya he‚Äînirmam adhikari, jaruri suvidhaon kaa abhaav, sarkari udaseenta, apane samarthan main bolne vaale ek bhi prashansak kaa na hona
 What is it in the Olympics that makes it the ultimate test of human achievement
 aisi koun-si shakti he jo khilaadi ko khel kii sabase badi chunauti se paar paane ke liye jamkar anjayas karne ke liye vivash karti he
 What is it that makes the pride of the Olympics a symbol of hope in a world full of despair
 iskaa uttar shaayad ek chote kad ke aadmi piyare di kubartin kii pariklpana main nihit he
 In 1912, just before the fifth modern Olympics, an idea emerged in the mind of this French noble
 unhone prayek paanch mahadwipon ke liye ek-ek challe kaa rekhachitr khinchaa, unhen ek-duusare se guntha or unhen duniya bhar ke rashtriya jhandon ke sabase chatkh rangon se rang diya
 And thus the great symbol of the Olympics was born
 paanch challe jo shanti or bhaichaare kaa pratik hai
 The five rings that connect countries, not by arrogance, but through mutual respect
 paanch challe jo pratiyogita main ishrya kii jagah prashansa ke bhav kaa pratik hai
 Kubertin said that the Olympics do not mean winning or losing, but showing how you played
 or isi main unki antim chunauti nihit he
 How do you play is not just about playing with dignity and honesty, but to play with your full potential, in which you push your full strength, break your limits, and along with it, the limits of human effort
 bharat main hamane kabhi bhi vastav main olympic ko is nazariye se nahin dekha
 Except hockey, all we had to do to be proud was to say that we kept winning in a few matches, like in 1960 and 1984
 iske alaava vyaktigat pradarshan ke taur par kuch prasannataa mishrit aashcharya bhi dekhne ko mili, jaise ki 1952, 1996, 2000 or 2004 main kramshah khashaaba jadhav, liender pes, karanam malleshwari or rajyavardhan rathod kaa pradarshan
 But our current generation of athletes has finally changed the picture, with organizations such as the Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ) also contributing immensely, providing talented players with the full opportunity to showcase their talents and ultimately discover the true spirit of the Olympics
 is
 nishchit hi bharat ko sahi myne main ek khelkud vaala raashtra banane ke liye abhi lanbaa safar tay karnaa hoga
 For that, our society will need to adopt sports as a culture, it will have to be a part of its life
 hamane abhi bahut chota kadam uthaaya he, lekin iske baavjood hamane mahatvapurn prayaas kiye hai
 In India Today Conclave 2016, all-england badminton champion and India's national coach Pullela Gopichand revealed the basic nature of the problem facing India
 gopichand ne do baraabar bhujaaon vaale ek tribhuj kaa rekhachitr banaaya or phir isamen kshaitij rekhaaen khinchakar tribhuj ke teen hisse kar die
 He said that the largest portion of the bottom is the number of people who participate in sports in India
 bich kaa hissaa un logon kii sankhya bataata he jo khel ko pratiyogita ke taur par khelte hai
 And the third smallest part is that of outstanding athletes, who have reached the peak
 unhone kaha ki is tarah ke zyada utkrisht khilaadi paane ke liye is tribhuj ko bada banane kii jarurat hogi taaki tribhuj kaa sabase chota hissaa samaanupaat ke hisaab se bada ho sake
 This is the only way
 samasya yah rahi he ki sarkaar ne khelon ko badhaava dene ke liye kuch bhi sahyog nahin diya he or jahaan chotii ke athleton, jo apane bal par kisi tarah shikhar tak pahunchane main kaamyaab rahe hai, ke liye suvidhaayen uplabdh hai, vahiin un khiladinnon ke liye ab bhi koi suvidha nahin di ja rahi he jo abhi upar chadhgaye kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But Gopichand's precise analysis presents a picture of a natural result
 yani hamaare chotii ke khilaadi jitna acha pradarshan karte hai, utana hi zyada ve tivi ke parade par padak ke liye muqabla karte najar aate hai, unki tasviren jitna zyada desh bhar ke mukkebaaji ke jimon, kushti ke akhaadon or shooting renjon main dikhaai dengi, utane hi zyada log khel ko apnaane ke liye prerit honge
 And in this way the foundation of the game in the country will be rapidly strengthened
 isliye rio 2016 bharat kii khel yatra main aglaa bada kadam sabit hoga
 Our select players are now daring to dream it
 or ab samay aa gaya he ki hamamen se baaki log bhi unke saath sapane dekhen
 So our next few pages will show how our top athletes overcame obstacles to do more than just give the nation a glimpse of hope
 or ab khel shuru hone kaa intjaar he
 The US is also concerned about violence in areas near the Line of Control (loc)
 america ne bharat or pakistan se aagrah kiya he ki vah seemaa se jude muddon ke hal ke liye baatcheet kii prakriya se jude
 Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jen Psaki said yesterday that we are worried about any violence in areas along the Line of Control
 ham bharat or pakistan kii sarkaron ko in muddon ke samaadhaan kii khatir aage kii vaarta ke liye lagaataar protsaahit karte rahenge
 In response to a question, he said that our policy on Kashmir has not changed
 ham ab bhi maanate hai ki kashmir par bharat or pakistan kii baatcheet kii gati, uskaa dayera or prakruti donon deshon ko hi tay karnaa he
 Relations in the region were also discussed in discussions held during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's two-day visit to Washington last week

 police jab tomars kii digriyon ke satyaapan ke liye unhen unke kolje bhi le gai thi, to vahaan ke shikshak bhi unhen pahchaan nahin sake the
 When the police arrested Tomar in this case, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia even said that situations like emergency have arisen

 If the better Rafael and Sukhoi attack together in many respects from the Indian Rafale Pakistani F-16, the enemy will be battered 87 years, amazing might in 12 major wars at home and abroad

 From 1932 to Balakot in Pakistan to Airstrike, every Indian's head has risen with pride every time
 har baar desh ke logon ne vayusena or uske hawaii ladaakon kaa 'abhinandan' kiya he
 After the Balakot air strike, when Abhinandan shot down Pakistan's state-of-the-art F-16 fighter jet from the mig-21, the entire nation once again rose headlong
 us samay baat uthi ki rafel hota to pakistan ke epa-16 kii itani bhi himmat na hoti ki wo hamaare akaash ko bhed sake
 The distinction could not be found anyway because our cowardice gave a brave response to our cowardice

 team india ke varsh 1999‚àí2000 ke australian daure se pehle bhartiya cricket niyantran board (bisisiai) ke tatkaaleen sachiv jayavant lele ne kaha tha ki team india 3-0 se haaregi, or us daure par aisa hi hua
 
 
 This time even before the Australian tour, former Australian fast bowler Glenn mcgrath has raised the concern of Team India by saying something similar
 
 
 phikr isliye bhi bad gai he, kyonki team kii takat or kamazoriyon kaa akalan, khilaadiyon ke garlfrend or biviyon ke saath guzaare gaye vakt ke bare main charchaa se shuru ho rahaa he
 
 
 The stand taken to ascertain the reasons for Team India's defeat in Test matches in England before the right post-mortem can become a major cause for concern for Team India
 
 
 darasal, phikr yah nahin honi chahie ki kis khilaad ne apni garlfrend ke saath england main kahaan kitna vakt bitaayaa, balki phikr is baat kii honi chahie ki maidan par agar khilaadi apana focus barkaraar nahin rakh paae to uski sahi or thos vajah kya rahi
 
 
 These are the special things in which Ravi Shastri, who became the director of Team India, got noticed after meeting the players for about two hours
 
 
 lekin purv captain ravi shastri ne ummid jataai he ki team india bounsbach zarur karegi, or team india kaa yah imtihaan england ke khilaaf paanch van-de international maichon kii shrunkhlaa ke saath hi shuru ho jayega
 
 
 By the way, this examination is not going to end in England, because after this, the phase of really difficult examinations will begin
 
 
 bhartiya team ko november main australia kaa daura karnaa he, jahaan use chaar test match or van-de maichon kii ek tri-series main hissaa lenaa he
 
 
 So, even more than the statement of Glen mcgrath of the upheaval in Team India, his own emerging weaknesses, which would be meaningless to think of victory without removing them

 maine yah bhi kaha tha ki jo vyakti kisi bade sanvaidhanik pad kaa daavedaar hota he usko apni baat jimmedaari se kerani chahie
 i regret that in every election meeting some big BJP leaders resort to concoction

 He said that our party does not believe in negative politics like BJP

 We do not believe in the use of derogatory words for some of the big BJP leaders
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ke kuch netaa har din tathyon ko tod marod kar aapako gumraah karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Before what he says, you should check the truth of his words properly

 Lalita, a woman living in Hari Singh Colony, Panipat has narrated the same agony
 12 saal pehle lalita ne apana baccha dere ke akhbaar main vigyaapan padhane ke baad daan main de diya tha
 Now remembering her child, Lalita's tears do not stop

 It was also said in the advertisement that every child who donates, starts raining well in his house
 daan main die bachche ke alaava lalita ke teen bachche or hai
 Her grief is even greater because her husband was also a follower of Dera, who is currently in jail

 yah baat 17july ko bahut saaf ho gai
 On this day, police and security personnel patrolled the 130 km long stretch of Sardar Sarovar Dam from Dhanki in Surendranagar to Malia in Rajkot district to prevent farmers from stealing water
 vaise to narmada kaa jal mukhyatah sinchai ke liye hi he, lekin rajya sarkaar ise uttar gujarat ke kuccha or saurashtrr ke logon ke liye peyajal ke rup main rakhane ko majaboor hui he
 This is the area where Modi is expected to face a tough challenge in the assembly elections to be held later this year
 haalanki, ab kaaphi der ho chuki he
 As Gujarat Water Resources Minister Nitin Patel says, "about a quarter of the monsoon has passed and the state has received only 150 mm of rainfall so far
" ab tak 800 mimi barish ho jaani chahie thi
 If the monsoon does not get better soon, it will have a bad effect on the crops
 haalanki, ham kisi bhi sankat se nibatane ke liye taiyaar hai, chaahe peyajal kii dikkat hi kyon na ho
 ‚Äúthese days only about 270 villages in the state require drinking water supply from tankers
 1990 ke dashak main jab narmada nahar or roak baandh nahin bane the, tanker par nirbhar gaanvon kii sankhya hajaaron main thi
 There are 210 medium and small dams in the state which have been able to fill only 33 per cent this year
 yah 50 fisadi ke anumaan se kaaphi kam he
 70% of the sowing has been done in the state and if the monsoon is absent till the first week of August, 30% of the crop will dry up
 kaaphi bade ilaake main dhan kii ropai nahin ho pai he kyonki iske liye paryaapt pani nahin he
 The Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River can prove to be a liberator for Gujarat
 pichley saal ke mukaable 35 fisadi pani kam jamaa hone ke baavjood isse sambhavit peyajal sankat se nibatane main madad milegi
 On the irrigation front, the problem is more serious because the catchment area of the state's large dams - Sardar Sarovar to Kadana on the Mahi and Ukai - on the Tapi - are in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan respectively and rain in these states also It has reduced a lot
 haalanki, pichley hafte isamen kuch sudhaar hua he
 If the monsoon fails, it can lead to urban-rural conflict before the election
 saurashtra ke kuch kisaanon main asantosh kii sugabugahat he, jinako narmada se sinchai ke liye pani lene se roak diya gaya tha
 It has become a weapon for the opposition Congress and Modi's own rival former Chief Minister Kavshubhai Patel
 ve pehle se hi modi sarkaar ko kisaan or korporate samarthak bataate rahe hai
 Most of Modi's key ministers ‚Äî Vajubhai Vala, Anandiben Patel, Nitin Patel and Saurabh Patel ‚Äî are from urban areas
 kshatrapon ko naaraaz kiye bina sarkaar ko thode sansadhano kaa shahari or gramin ilaakon main santulit vitaran karnaa hoga
 Keshubhai Patel along with former Chief Minister Suresh Mehta and former Union Minister Kashiram Rana are holding rallies under the banner of 'parivartan' in the state
 22 july ko unhone modi ko logon kii samasyaon se nibatane ke maamle main ''gande jaisi moti chamadi kaa bataaya
 At the Rajkot rally, he called the Chief Minister a 'rotten fruit' which should be discarded
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki modi vikaas ke galat daawey kar rahe hai or 'jhuthe' hai
 Modi and his supporters have so far maintained a dignified silence
 lekin yah tikdi mukhyamantri par hamale kaa koi mauka nahin chuknaa chaahati or sookhaa unhen iskaa aasaan rasta degaa
 But Nitin Patel says, "we hope the drought doesn't come
" aisa hua to bhi yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki isse prabhavi tareeke se nibat kar ham janata kii tarif hasil kar sakate hai
 We are ready to deal with any situation

 The letter written by Maharashtra government secretary Vinita Singal states, "the proposed artificial reef from the former INS Ganga will generate thousands of jobs for the local community, and will increase the regional economy by more than Rs 100 crore per year
" 
 
 "neeche dikhaae gaye khat main vistrut fisibility report bhi he, or bataaya gaya he ki kritrim rif taiyaar karnaa 'sweekaarya kadam he,' jise paryaavaran ke prati uttardaayitv pradarshit karne vaale tathaa sthaneey paryaton arthvyavastha ko badhotaree dene vaale kadam ke rup main dekha jaataa he

 "after two years, neither of the two proposals has made much progress, and now it is almost certain that INS Viraat will go to the wreckers in the same way as the country's first aircraft carrier INS Vikrant
 i went

 The airline said it is in talks with the tax authorities to open its bank accounts
 saath hi usne payalton se bhi kaam par aane kaa aagrah kiya he
 The comments vetan main deree kaa virodh kar rahe payalton kaa daawa he ki kingfisher ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari sanjay agarwal ne brihaspativaar ko baatcheet ke dauraan chetaya tha ki yadi ve kaam par nahin lautate hai, to company aakhri kadam uthaa sakati he yani bandi kar sakati he
 Prakash Mirpuri, vice-president (corporate communications), Airlines, said, "sanjay Agarwal had pleaded not to miss duty during a meeting with a group of pilots
" baatcheet main kisi bhi samay airline ko band kiye jane kaa mudda nahin uthaa
 "we are cooperating with the tax authorities and trying to get the freeze removed from our accounts, to normalize the situation and pay salaries to the employees," he said
 haalanki, payalton kaa kahana he ki baithak ke dauraan agarwal ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòyadi aap vimaan udaana chaahate ho to thik he, nahin chaahate hai, to aap aisa karne ke liye swatantra hai
 In such a situation, we have to consider any last option
 ‚Äô‚Äô ek payalat ne bataaya ki agarwal ne baatcheet main kaha ki vah 10 march se pehle kisi tarah kii patibaddhta nahin jataa sakate hai
 The pilots, who have been protesting against the delay in pay, claim that Kingfisher CEO Sanjay Aggarwal warned during talks on Thursday that if they do not return to work, the company may take the last step, ie closure
 airlines ke upaadhyaksh (corporate communications) prakaash mirpuri ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòsanjay agarwal ne payalton ke ek samooh ke saath mulaakaat ke dauraan unhen duty se nadaarad nahin rahane kii apil kii thi
 At no point in the negotiations did the issue of the airline take off
 ‚Äô‚Äô unhone kaha ki ham kar adhikariyon ke saath sahyog kar rahe hai or apane khaaton se fries hatwane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, jisase sthiti ko saamaanya kiya ja sake or karmchaariyon ko vetan kaa bhugtan kiya ja sake
 However, the pilots say that during the meeting, Aggarwal said, "if you want to fly the aircraft, it is okay, if you don't want to, then you are free to do so
" aise main hamen kisi antim vikalp par vichaar karnaa hoga
 "A pilot said that Agarwal said in conversation that he cannot make any commitment before March 10
 haalanki, payalton kaa kahana he ki baithak ke dauraan agarwal ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòyadi aap vimaan udaana chaahate ho to thik he, nahin chaahate hai, to aap aisa karne ke liye swatantra hai

 shivaratan agarwal (63 varsh) chairman, bikaaji bhujiyakavi ashok vaajapeyi ne kaha tha ki bikaner kii aadhi aabaadi bhujiyaa banane main vyast he to aadhi aabaadi ise khaane main
 Whether this is true or not, yes, it is certain that Bikajier's Bikaji Group owns more than half of the total Bhujia production
 bikaaji group ke chairman shivaratan agarwal ne apane is paramparaagat vyavsaay ko ek global pahchaan dilaai he
 Bikaji Foods owes its distinct flavor to the sharpness of the Bikaneri Bhujia and the sweet taste of the rasgullas to the amateurs of the seven seas and giving it a distinct identity
 haalanki bikaaji group kaa yah safar apane aap main safalataa or upaldbridh kaa lanbaa safar he, lekin yah itnaa aasaan bhi nahin tha
 As soon as Bhujia's name comes up, a picture of a confectionery with a large black cauldron and flies buzzing around emerges in spite of lacquer cleaning
 lekin bikaaji ne is chhavi ko todaa he
 Like this, it has started making the food chain even more attractive in appearance
 jivan main kuch alag or behatar karne kaa sapana sanjoe mahaj 8veen paas shivaratan agarwal ke man main ek aisi bhujiyaa factory lagane kaa khyaal aayaa, jo mahaj ek bhujiyaa factory na ho, balki use ek vaishvik pahchaan mili
 Initially, Shivratan's father, who is doing business of Bhujia with books, could not believe that there could be a factory to make Bhujia
 1987 main bikaner main bhujiyaa factory kii shuruyaat hui
 Two banks had refused to give loans in Bhujia's name
 jaise-taise ek bank karj dene ke liye raji hua
 The Bikaji brand emerged in 1993 following the division of the family business
 shivaratan agarwal kehete he, ''koyale se dijal kii bhatti par logon se kaam karwaanaa mushkil tha
 Initially, he himself learned to burn a furnace of diesel and taught the workers
 kaaphi dikkatein bhi ain
 Even before setting up the factory, it used to be considered in the mind that which such indigenous equipment should be used, which can save time, ease the working and produce more quantity of bhujia-papad etc
 shivaratan apane ek dost makkhan agarwal ke saath papad-bhujiyaa ke nirmaan main kaam aane vaali saamagree besan ityadi lekar bhatakate taaki demo dekar kuch upyogi upkaran taiyaar karwaae ja saken
 In search of such equipment, they also searched small towns like Rajpura in Punjab
 ve lohe ke upkaran banane vaale kaarigaron se kuch aisa banane ko kehete, jisase yah kaam jaldi ho sake
 Sometimes you get success, sometimes you don't
 lekin ab yah sab beete samay kii baat ho gai he
 Bikaji Food Company today Rs 1,400 crore
 kii company he, jiskaa salanaa turnover 500 karod ru
 Belongs to ab bhujiyaa, papad or rasagullon ke alaava bikaaji kii pani puri tak shandaar packing main uplabdh he
 a total of 80 food items are made at Bikaji
 shivaratan 63 saal kii umr main aaj bhi roj factory jate hai
 Everyone keeps an eye on them, from the bhujia maker to the packing worker
 ve sabko nijee taur par jaanate hai or zyaadaatar karmiyon ko unke naam se pukaarte hai
 Shivaratan, one of the four sons of father late Moolchand and mother Chuka Devi, is focused on what flavor or new technique to use, which will keep his reign in the world of flavors
 is kaam main unki patni sushila bhi kaaphi madad karti hai
 Son Deepak Agarwal is the MD of the company
 deepak apane pita ko parfect fadar maanate hai
 He says, "father is very experienced and practical
 ve on da spot faisle lene main yakeen rakhte hai
 He has a special attachment with Bikaner
 ham 170 karod ru
 Is working on a new project
 '' yah sach he ki kitaabi shiksha main bhale hi ve pichad gaye hon, lekin vyaavhaarik gyaan or samajhadaari ke bal par hi unhone khud ko is mukaam tak pahunchaaya he
 In 2010, Geographical Indication was named after Bikaner
 kabhi boriyon main bhar ke le jaae jane vaali bhujiyaa ko pehle carton main pack karke bheja janaa shuru hua
 Today, due to automation packing, spicy packets of Bikaji are making traditional food attractive
 aaj america, europe or khadi ke takreeban 24 deshon main bikaaji ke utpaadon kaa niryaat kiya ja rahaa he
 Bikaji's record of producing 50 tonnes of Bhujia per day along with other achievements is also recorded
 shivaratan agarwal ke putr deepak agarwal bhi ab pita ke kaarobaar main apana haath banta rahe hai
 In 2014, the company launched a new series Ready to Eat and Ready to Cook, focusing on traditional Indian breakfasts
 bikaaji group ne apane ritel outlet bhi khole hai, jahaan unke sabhi utpaada uplabdh hai
 So far, these outlets have been opened in a total of 25 cities across the country including Mumbai
 The company also has ambitious plans for the future
 shivaratan bataate hai ki jald hi ve landan main bikaaji kaa outlet kholane ja rahe hai
 Prospects are being searched in countries where Bikaji outlets are not open yet
 unki koshish he ki company aagaamee varshon main apana ipio bhi lekar laae
 In a small town like Bikaner, a cardiac hospital has been built in collaboration with the Bikaji Group
 iske alaava company ne farvari, 2015 main tatkaaleen jila colector aarti dogra ke saath milakar ek emoyu par bhi sin kiye hai, jiske tahat sarkari vidyalayon main shauchalay banane kaa kaam bikaaji group ke sahyog se kiya ja rahaa he
 Bikaner remains in the eye of the third eye, for this CCTV cameras are being installed across the city, for which Bikaji is providing financial help
 iske alaava, maharaja ganga singh vishvavidhyalay kii kulapati chandrakala padipha se bhi unki baat chal rahi he
 Deepak says, "around 20 crores
 kii laagat se banane vaali ek atyaadhunik lab kii sthapana main ham sahyog dene ke liye taiyaar hai, jahaan food item kii jaanch ho sakegi
 Overall, it would not be an exaggeration to say that it is the hard work, passion and charisma of this businessman that he has made the most traditional Bikaneri product like Bhujia a global one
 shivaratan kii ishwar main gahari aasthaa he, lekin unke liye kaam hi pehali puja he
 He says, "I cannot go to the temple every day, but i am a worshiper of Bhairo
" hafte main ek baar mandir jaataa hum
 To me, worshiping God also means helping the needy
 ''bikaner main kuch log shivaratan ko bhujiyaa kaa badshaah kahkar bulaate hai to kuch mastamaula swabhaav ke kaaran aaj bhi unhen unke bachapan ke naam phanna babu se hi pukaarte hai
 The king of Bhujia has also played the role of Bhamashah for the city
 shivaratan satat lagan, mehnat or kabhi haar na maanane ke jazbe ko hi apni safalataa kaa mantra maanate hai
 He says, "it is not necessary for success to do business in the metropolis itself
" main bikaner main bhujiyaa banaakar puri duniya main bech rahaa hum
 Just be devoted to your work

 And you know how much those people hate their jobs
 yahaan ham aapako bataate hai logon ke offis main apane kaam se pareshaan hone kii 10 vajahen
 
 
 1
 bahut se cese main job se pareshaan hone kaa kaaran kharaab bos or management hota he
 If you are unable to meet your boss, the way to divide the work in the team is also baseless, your objections are ignored, then despite having a good salary and a favorite job, the passion for work goes on
 2
 If there is no stability in the job and you are always afraid of going to your job then you will never be happy in the office
 job ke prati asuraksha kii bhaavana uske prati nafrat ko janm detii he
 3
 offis main kaam kam ho rahaa he or raajnneeti zyada
 
 
 You get fed up with such environment too
 4
 Work is too much and according to that salary is not available
 pad va vetan ke mutabik jimmedaariyaan nahin di gai he or aap bevajaah kaam ke boj se dabe hue hai
 5
 bahut se logon ke imidiet bos us pad ke kaabil nahin hote
 His dictatorial attitude and ignorance of the work keep the juniors distraught
 aise maahaul main nakaaratmak vichaar hi dimag main aate hai
 6
 kaam ke liye jin sajo-saamaan va mashiinon kii jarurat he, unke na hone kii sthiti main bhi frestrishan hoti he
 Many times, despite complaining many times, the necessary tools are not given
 7
 You are discouraged even if you do not see any future of the field you are working in in the office
 8
 Many people get fed up with the red tape of office
 aapaki baat va aap kabhi sahi shaks tak nahin pahunch pate
 The comments 9
 You end up hating your job in the event of loss of enthusiasm and enthusiasm in work
 10
 Even if you are unable to use your non-working hovers for personal enjoyment, there is a problem of fretting about jobs

 5
 Many people's intermediate bosses do not qualify for that position
 unka taanaashaahee ravaiya or kaam ke prati agyanta se junior pareshaan rahete hai

 kai baar to bahut baar shikaayat karne ke baavjood jaruri tuls nahin die jate
 7
 offis main aap jo kaam kar rahe hai us field kaa aapako koi bhavishya najar nahin aata, to bhi aap hatotsahit hote hai

 First ODI of the series in Durban at 4pm Indian time
 30 baje shuru hoga
 There is now only 14 months left for the World Cup-2019, and in such a situation, India will also start its preparations for the Cricket Mahakumbh from this series
 kaaphi vyast he bharat kaa shedulabharat ko dakshin africa se chah vanade or teen tii-20 match khilne ke baad srilanka main tri siries main bhaag lenaa he
 Then there will be IPL 11, followed by three odis and three T20 matches in England and Ireland
 team india agast main paanch test maichon kii siries ke liye england kaa daura karegi
 Based on the performance of so many odis, especially South Africa and England, the team management will also get a chance to ensure their team for the World Cup
 use team main jaruri sudhaar karne kaa avasar bhi milegaa
 Amidst all this, the Indian team will try to win their first bilateral ODI series in South Africa
 africa main bharat kaa recordbharat ko africa main kheli gai chaar dwipaksheeya siries main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He also participated in the tri-series here twice, with the third team being Zimbabwe and Kenya, but still South Africa became the champion
 vanade main bhi bharat kaa bura haal, africa main 25 saal se nahin jite sirisbharat kaa dakshin africa main dwipaksheeya shrinkhalaaon main recordchha nahin he
 Till now, Team India has played a total of 20 matches in their bilateral ODI series against Africa on their land, out of which only 4 have won them
 durban kaa record bharat ko daraata hapahala match durban main khelaa jayega jahaan bharat kaa record acha nahin rahaa he
 Out of the seven matches that India have played at this place from 1992-93 against South Africa, they lost six, while one did not result
 bharat ne haalanki 2003 world cap ke dauraan yahaan england or kenya ko haraaya tha
 India will have a chance to top Team India in ODI rankings, India will also have to get top position in ODI team rankings by performing well in this series
 bharat agar 4-2 se siries jeet letaa he, to vah dakshin africa ke sthaan par sheersh par pahunch jayega
 There is now a difference of only two rating points between the two teams
 viraat kohli kii team ne pichley saptaah wanderrs main apana ajey abhiyaan jari rakhkar test maichon main number ek ranking bhi barkaraar rakhi
 South Africa may have won the Test series 2‚Äì1, but they lost the third match in Johannesburg by 63 runs, where the pitch was dismissed by the ICC match referee
 2016 se siries nahin haari team indiyabharat kaa philhal vanade record bhi shandaar rahaa he
 He has not lost a single bilateral series since losing the series 1‚Äì4 to Australia in January 2016
 is bich usne zimbabwe, newjiland (do baar), england, westeindies, srilanka (do baar) ore australia ko haraaya
 During this time India won 24 out of 32 matches of the bilateral series
 bharat is bich keval england main pichley saal kheli gai champions trophy ke final main pakistan se parajeet hua tha
 New Zealand Cricket Association said - Auction of players being done like animals in IPL Indian team is in good form
 captain kohli srilanka ke khilaaf limited overs kii siries main nahin khele the
 So one or two places have to be decided in the middle order
 shreyas ayyar ne is bich acchhee form dikhaai thi or isliye unka paksh majboot he, lekin yahaan anubhav ko bhi tavajjo di jaaegi tathaa dinesh karthik or manish pandey bhi ek sthaan kii daud main hai
 The pitch and conditions look brittle and rain in Durban
 kal bhi barish kii bhavishyavaanee kii gai he
 In such a situation, it will have to be seen how many spinners India takes
 agar ek spinner plaing ilevan main shaamil kiya jaataa he, to chinamen kuldeep yadav ko akshar patel or yujavendra chahal par tavajjo di ja sakati he, taaki vah david miller or jepi dumini jaise baayen haath ke ballebaajon par ankush laga saken
 De Villiers boosted Africa's concern South Africa is also eyeing the upcoming World Cup, but it will have to go without AB de Villiers, who has a finger injury in the first three games
 aise main farhaan beherdin ko team main rakhaa jaataa tha, lekin is baar unhen team main nahin liya gaya he
 Durban-born batsman Khayalila Jondo can make her debut
 ek anya vikalp hashim amala or quinton di cock ke saath pari kaa aagaaj karne or aden markeram ko madhyakram main utaarne kaa he
 South Africa may take on the lone spinner Imran Tahir

 This post has been shared thousands of times on Kofacebook
 hamane internet ko achche tarah se khangala, lekin nasiruddin shah ke is bayaan kaa zikr hamen kisi bhi news artical main nahin mila

 desai ne kaha, ‚Äòaisa mana jaataa tha ki jorge dablyoo bush rishte ko majboot karne ke liye vyaktigat taur par patibaddh the

 indian-american Visakha Desai said that Indians felt that the Americans did not fully understand the cultural complexities of fighting a war in Afghanistan and became too dependent on Pakistan (meaning that Indians were not consulted enough)
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòbhartiya arthvyavastha jabardast tareeke se oochaal par he (is saal iske nau fisadi rahane kii ummid he) or sarkaar ne dollar kii tulana main rupaye ko uthne kii ijaajat de di he

 Desai said that all this can happen but what is so important for India is that it should tell what needs to be done to strengthen the dialogue and take the relationship to new heights

 The people of Umrah Jati, the ancestral village of former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, are not happy with the victory of Imran Khan's party Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI)
 kisi samay sharif khandaan ke padosi rahe logon ko unki ummid se vipareet aae chunaav parinaam se dukh pahunchaa he
 Justifying the allegations made by Shahbaz Sharif, the head of the Imranpakistan Muslim League PML (N), who won the elections, the people of Jati Umra said that Imran Khan has managed to win the elections only with the help of separatist organizations and the army
 pakistan ke aam chunaavon par najar rakh rahe jaati umara ke logon ke mutabik matganana main hui dhaandhliyon or sena ke prabhaav ke karanpakistan muslim ligaur uske netaaon ko kuchalane kii koshish kii gai jo jamhuriyat ke liye sahi nahin he
 Former sarpanch of Jati Umra, Gurbachan Singh said that the Pakistani Army tried to influence the election process before and after the elections
 jisase navaj sharif ke khilaaf hawa banaai ja sake
 According to local resident Hardeep Singh, Pakistani army and separatist organization were behind Nawaz Sharif
 imran khan kii party (PTI) sena ke sahyog or dakhsandaji ke kaaran hi jiti he
 According to the happy defeat of Hafiz Saeed's party, according to Khushadilbag Singh, he was very sad to hear the election results of Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki chunaav main jin adhikariyon ko tainaat kiya gaya tha unase insaaf kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati thi

 ayodhya main ram mandir-babari masjid vivaad 1950 se adaalat main chal rahaa he
 These days, different organizations in the country are raising various voices from various forums regarding the construction of Ram temple
 aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat kii chahat he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ram mandir ek bada mudda bane to vahiin viechpi ke sur badal gaye hai
 For Ram temple not to become an election issue, he has decided to keep silence on this matter for 4 months
 vahiin, supreme court is maamle main koi jaldbaaji main nahin he, lekin modi sarkaar ne bhi apana najariya saaf kar diya
 In this way, as many mouths are being spoken at the Ram temple
 2019 main ram mandir kaa mudda ahm : mohan bhagwatarashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) ke pramukh mohan bhagwat 4 din ke daure par mangalvaar ko uttarakhand ke dehradun pahunche

 2014 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main NDA ke paas ram mandir mudda nahin bhi hota, to bhi bijepi kii sarkaar banati
 Because there was a wave in favor of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, people were not caring about Ram temple
 unhen us samay vikalp kii talash thi, lekin ab ram mandir ke alaava koi doosraa vikalp nahin he
 In such a situation, the Ram temple will be the main issue in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 loksabhaa chunaav tak ram mandir par viechpi khamoshwahin, vishwa hindu parishad (VHP) ne mangalvaar ko hi ram mandir par aresas se ulat faisla liya

 He said that we are often accused of running a Ram temple construction campaign for political benefit to a particular party
 aise main ham isen kisi raajnneetik dal main is mudde ko nahin fansaana chaahate hai
 This is a sacred issue, we want to keep it beyond politics
 sarkaar kaa najariyaaraam mandir ke nirmaan ke liye modi sarkaar ne bhi apana najariya saamne rakh diya he
 The government does not want to take any step towards bringing an ordinance for the Ram temple
 iske badale sarkaar ne ayodhya vivaad maamle main vivaadit jameen chhodkar baaki jameen ko lautne or is par jari yathasthiti hataane kii maang kar bada kadam uthaaya he
 2 of the 67 acres of land the government had asked to return
 67 acre vivaadit jameen ke chaaron ore sthit he
 In 1993, the central government acquired the disputed site and surrounding land under the Ayodhya Acquisition Act
 iske alaava pradhanmantri narendra modi ANI ko nae saal par die intervyuu main kaha tha ki supreme court ke faisla kaa hamen intejaar karnaa chahie
 However, BJP leaders are constantly saying that the Congress is becoming an obstacle in the path of Ram temple
 congress adaalat ke faisle ke saathram mandir maamle par congress shuru se ek baat karti rahi he ki supreme court kaa jo bhi faisla hoga wo use maanegi
 Many Congress Party leaders have said that the Congress has been saying from the beginning that the disputed site should be resolved through court
 randeep singh surajevaala ne haal hi main kaha ki party kaa paksh hameshaa se spasht rahaa he ki ayodhya kaa maamla supreme court hi tay karegi

 Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati had said, 'we will lay the foundation of Ram temple in Ayodhya on 21 February 2019
 ham court ke kisi bhi aadesh kaa ulanghan nahin kar rahe hai
 It remains in force until the Supreme Court rejects the High Court order
 vahaan ram lalaa virajman hai, vah janmabhumi he

 But the regular hearing of this case has not started yet
 jabaki abhi ayodhya se jude hue dastavej ke paper ke anuwaad ko dobaaraa se karaane kii baat kahi he

 The petitioner said that he belongs to the Ahir / Yadav caste and fulfills all the qualifications of the President for the recruitment of bodyguard except caste

 The petition states that by giving priority to the three castes, the other eligible citizens have been denied the opportunity of recruitment

 Film Name: Endangered: Prabhu Rajstar Cast: Javed Jaffrey, Vijay Raj, Nikki Aneja Walia, Minakshi Dixit, Rishabh Chaddha, Karan Anand Duration: 1 hour 57 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 1
 5 starajaved jaafaree or vijay raaj kaa combo lekar diarector prabhu raaj ne film lupt kaa nirmaan kiya he
 The trailer of the film was appreciated and later the promotion from Urmila Matondkar's song 'bhoot Hoon Main' started
 ab film relies hone ke liye taiyaar he
 Let's know how this film is made after all
 
 
 kahanefilm kii kahani bijnesaman harsh tandon (javed jaafaree) se shuru hoti he, jo ki bijness main top level par janaa chahta he
 He is survived by his son Sam (rishabh Chadha), wife (nikki Aneja) and daughter Tanu (meenakshi Dixit)
 sam ko samay-samay par prank khilne kii aadat he
 Tanu's boyfriend is photographer Rahul (karan Anand)
 harsh ko samay-samay par ajeebogareeb log dikhaai dete hai, jisaki vajah se unki manochikitsak unhen chuttee par jane ke liye kahati hai
 Harsh leaves his car for vacation with his wife and Rahul and leaves from Lucknow to Nainital
 bich raste main uski gaadi kharaab ho jaati he
 Because of this, an unknown traveler Vijay Raj asks him to stay overnight in his house
 phir kahani main bahut saare twist shuru ho jate hai or samay-samay par ajeebogareeb bhoot se related ghatnaayen bhi hone lagati hai
 Weak Links: The film's weak link is its staggering story and screenplay
 kirdaaron kii leering bhi gadabad he
 The one liner of the story was good
 interval se pehle kaa hissaa bhi thik tha
 But the second half of the film is completely boring
 aakhirkaar khoda pahaad or nikali chuhia vaali kahawat sach hoti dikhti he
 The head and foot of repeated incidents are not understood
 ek pal ke baad boriyat bhi hone lagati he
 The camera work of the film has also faded, again and again the same scenes are seen
 ek tareeke se yah wo film nahin ban pai he, jo darshakon ko rijhaa sake
 In terms of acting too, each character is almost West
 kahani badhiya hoti to javed jaafaree or vijay raaj jaise actors bhi umdaa najar aate
 The castings are also not good
 diarector prabhu raaj ne prayaas to kiya he lekin kahani ne unhen kamjor kar diya he
 Why watch the film? The background score and two songs of the film are good
 agar aap javed jaafaree yaa vijay raaj ke fain he to ek baar jarur tri kar sakate hai
 Meenakshi Dixit's work is also good
 box offispromoshan ke saath film kaa bajet or baj, donon kaaphi kam he
 Already, two films of Ayushman Khurana, Andhadhun and Badhaai Ho, are doing wonders at the box office, it will be interesting to see whether 'lost' does a good business, or 'extinct' among them all

 After Firangi's flop at the box office, Kapil is going to get a big shock on TV too
 sutron ke mutabik channel kapil ke sho "family time wyeth kapil sharma" ko band karne kaa mood bana chukaa he
 Recently, the show premiered on Sony TV on 25 March
 ab tak iske teen episod prasaarit hue hai
 Why believe Kapil's show will be closed? Actually, last week Sony TV did not broadcast Kapil's show
 prasaaran ke liye episod shoot hi nahin ho paaya tha
 If sources are to be believed, the episode has not been shot for the Saturday and Sunday airings this week
 channel ke bank main 'fimali time wyeth kapil sharma' kaa koi advance episod nahin he
 According to sources, Kapil Sharma is silent

 The channel created a mood to turn the show off due to their arbitrary and outdated structure

 Last week, Kapil's show in barc's TRP managed to make it to the top ten
 vah premier sho tha
 'bhabi Ji' came in support of Kapil Sharma, this appeal from the media came after a long time, so it was natural to see his show
 ab nai tiarapy ke jariye kapil ke sho kii lokapriyata aanki jaaegi
 The channel wants to see if people are still really fond of Kapil
 sutara kaa kahana he ki nai tiarapy main kapil ke sho kii sthiti hi unke bachane kaa ekmaatr mauka he
 However another source said, whatever the TRP, Kapil's show is set to close
 is sutara ke mutabik kapil ke sho ko riples karne ke liye kai program qatari main hai
 If that happens, it would be very bad for Kapil's career

 3 din pehle beete buudhvaar shaam yuvati police lines main raghuvendra naam ke vyakti ke saath ai thi, jise vah apana pita bataa rahi thi
 Prabhjot said that she has been transferred here from Moradabad and got posted at Vijayanagar police station
 aaropee yuvati kahana tha ki jab tak uske rahane kaa koi intjaam nahin ho jaataa tab tak use police line ke barrack main rahane diya jaye
 Following this woman's appeal, she was allowed to stay in the women's barrack
 vahiin yuvati daroga kii vardi pahan kar gajiabad police line pahuchin thi jisaki vajah se vahaan tainaat pulicekarmi bhi dhokhaa kha gaye or use rahane ke liye mahila barrack uplabdh kara di gai
 According to the official information, due to more time in the barrack, when the woman did not go to the police station to make an income during her stay in the barrack and spent more time in the barrack
 uski in gatividhiyon ko dekhakar police line gajiabad ke pratisar nireekshak (aarai) ko maamle kii jaankaree di gai or phir poochtacha main sari sachai saamne aa gai
 In the police interrogation, the woman could not even show her I-card and could not reveal her PNO number
 jabaki jaanch main vijaynagar thane main tainaati kii baat bhi farji nikali
