 Latika reacted to his remarks, saying, 'it is unfortunate that a person 10 years older than my father made such a comment

 Latika, the chairperson of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee and the vice-president of the Women's Congress of the country, recalled how Achuthanandan was in trouble some years ago due to his objectionable statement against Sandeep Unnikrishnan's father
 unnikrishnan mumbai hamale ke dauraan shahid ho gaye the
 Latika said, 'I leave the responsibility of the Kerala society to react to what they have said

 During the discussion in the Rajya Sabha on the foreign policy, there was a fierce clash between the ruling and the opposition
 vipaksh ke tamaam sawaalon or aaropon par videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne silsilewar tareeke se jawaab diya
 But the Congress leaders were not satisfied with his answer
 jiske baad unhone sushamaa swaraj ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar hanan prastaav laane kii baat kahi he
 Congress's Rajya Sabha member Anand Sharma said that Sushma Swaraj has lied to the House
 unhone kaha ki sushamaa apane bayaan par maafee maange, nahin to unhen visheshadhikaar hanan kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Anand Sharma said that before the encounter of Burhan Wani, Pathankot was attacked, besides 9 more terror attacks, which Sushma Swaraj forgot
 vahiin congress saansad rajeev shukla ne bhi sushamaa ke bayaan par tippanee kii
 He said that the statement given by the Foreign Minister in the House about me is completely wrong
 rajeev shukla ne sushamaa ke khilayevisheshadhikaar noticelane kii baat kahi
 In fact, Sushma Swaraj had said in the House that she did not get a chance to make a statement in the conference on Bandung asia-africa relations
 vahiin, congress saansad anand sharma ye kehete rahe ki unhone bhaashan diya or purv piem pandit nehru kaa naam nahin liya
 At the same time, Sushma Swaraj had told in the House on India's relations with Pakistan that after the Burhan Wanike encounter in Kashmir in 2016, the relations between the two countries had deteriorated
 jabaki congress kaa kahana he ki 2015 main piem modi jab pakistan ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko berthde kii mubaarakabaad dene lahore gaye, uske kuch vakt baad hi pathankot main aatanki hamalaa hua
 The opposition also believes that in addition to Pathankot five more incidents took place
 vahiin sushamaa swaraj ne rajeev shukla par tippanee karte hue kaha tha '' aapke rajeev shukla kah rahe hai ki CPEC kyon nahin de dete, OBOR main kyon nahin gaye
 It is related to our sovereignty, how can we give CPEC, it is going through pok
 to kya congress main itnaa loktantr he ki anand sharma kuch or baat karen or phir uske baad bhi rajeev shukla kuch kah jaaen
 "rajiv Shukla has dismissed Sushma's statement as false
 sarkaar ke faislon ke virodh main vipakshi dalon ne vidhansabha kii kaarywahi beete do satron se puri tarah se thap kar rakhi he
 This process of boycott of the house can also be seen during the budget session starting from 17 January
 vidhansabha kaa bajet satr 7 farvari tak chalegaa
 Both the ruling party and the opposition have started siege to each other
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki soobe kii janata sthaniyata or sianti / esapiti act par liye gaye uske faislon se kaaphi raahat mahasoos kar rahi he
 With these decisions, the declaration of giving job to the youth who have been stuck for a long time will be implemented
 saath hi saath sadiyon puraane act main samay ke anusaar badalane ke sarkaar ke kadam se adivaasiyon ko laabh hoga or unki aarthik sthiti behatar hogi
 Is the BJP government of the state anti-tribal? Is the anti-tribal government of the bjp-majority NDA government in power in the state? vipakshi dalon kii maane to satta sanbhaalane ke baad abtak liye gaye nirnay to yahi darshaate hai ki bijepi sarkaar adivasee virdohi he
 These parties believe that whether the question of localism or presently the decision of the government on the amendment of CNT-SPT Act is completely against the interests of the tribals here
 in faislon ko agar amal main laayaa gaya to soobe main baimani fail sakati he
 Opposition parties allege that the government is trying to mislead the innocent people here by making false promises of development
 janata ko gumraah kar rahaa he vipakshsarkaar kaa kahana he ki vipaksh bina vajah vivaad khadaa kar soobe kii janata ko gumraah karne main laga he
 To which the government will reply in its own way
 vahiin sarkaarvipaksh ko sadhaneke liye bhi hatkande apana rahi he taaki bajet satr bina kisi vyavdhaan ke sampann ho sake
 While the Opposition has not yet relaxed its attitude on these issues
 rajya main mukhyavipakshi daljeemem kaa kahana he ki vipaksh sadan main apni duty karne se peeche nahin hatega
 Every decision of the government will be opposed which will be against the interests of tribal and general public
 jabaki congress kaa kahana he ki sadan sucharu rup se chalaanaa sarkaar kaa daayitv he or use vipaksh se samvaad sthapit karnaa hoga

 On behalf of Modi, senior BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi climbed the sheet
 khwaja kii dar par chadar pesh karne kii ravaayat puraani he
 Prime Minister Modi's sheet has become special because Modi has also retained the old custom of the country
 buudhvaar ko modi kii chadar khwaja ke darbar main chadhaai gai, to guuruuvaar ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii ore se bhi chadar pesh kii jaaegi
 In fact, when the roads are closed on all sides in the borders of politics, then these same rates of Sufi-saints show the light of the right path to all the rulers

 birmingham ke edbeston maidan par bharat or pakistan ke bich mukaable se pehle tamaam tarah ke daawey kiye ja rahe the
 By the way, Team India has always defeated Pakistan in the big match
 lekin champions trophy ke is mukaable ko lekar pakistani team ke saath-saath cricket ke jaankaar kadi takkar kii baat kar rahe the
 Anyway, cricket between India and Pakistan becomes a nose question for the people of both countries
 lekin agar birmingham match main pakistani team ke pradarshan par gaur kiya jaae to kabhi us team main wo jajba or junun nahin dikhaa, jiske liye team jaani jaati thi
 Earlier, even though India had defeated Pakistan in matches, Pakistan's team seemed to struggle in the field to win till the last ball
 jo edbeston maidan main najar nahin aayaa
 Looking at the Pakistani players, it felt as if someone had said in their ears that the victory would be of India and then they gave up their arms
 pakistan ne toss jitkar pehle gendbaaji chuni
 When Pakistan's team, known for sharp bowling, came on the field, it seemed that after 28 months, both teams are face to face, then the match will be full of thrills
 lekin shuruyaat se hi kabhi bhi pakistani khilaadiyon main wo dam nahin dikhaa, jo bharat ke khilaaf khel ke maidan par dekhne ko miltaa tha
 Edgbaston's ground was good for the batsmen
 lekin phir bhi jis tarah se bhartiya ballebaaj ran bator rahe the, or pakistani gendbaaj maidan par trast najar aa rahe the
 It was clear from this that Pakistani players have succumbed in this match
 agar bhartiya ballebaajon ke wicket gire bhi to use pakistani gendbaaji kii kamyaabi se jodakar nahin dekha ja saktaa, kyonki ballebaajon ne apni galati se wicket ganvaae
 Whether it is Shikhar Dhawan's wicket or Kohli, Yuvraj is out
 kabhi bhi pakistani gendbaaji main dhar nahin dikhi, or naa hi fielding karte khilaadiyon main wo jajba
 There was a time when Pakistani players used to appeal strongly to every ball, the thrill of the match being at its peak
 or aakhri gend tak jeet ke liye ladaai jari rahati thi
 Not just bowling, the way Pakistani players gave up easy catches and then many times such runs got to Indian batsmen who question the morale of Pakistan players
 uske baad jab ballebaaji kii baari ai to laga ki lakshya kaa peechha karne ke liye pakistani khilaadi ji-jaan laga denge
 But no batsman except Azhar Ali could not stand the crease
 laga hi nahin wo bharat ke khilaaf jeetne ke liye ballebaaji kar rahe hai
 One wicket fell after the other, and Pakistan lost 124 runs at the hands of India in the history of Champions Trophy

 ' The SPG amendment bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha even before the change in the Act many times
 The central government introduced the SPG i
e
 Special Protection Group (amendment) bill in the Lok Sabha on Monday amid the sloganeering and uproar by Congress mps
 ek taraf maharashtra kii siyaasi uthapatak surkhiyon main hone kii vajah se sattarudh party or vipakshi partiyaan vyast dikhin, vahiin loksabhaa main grih rajya mantri ji kishan reddy ne shorgul ke bich SPG sanshodhan bill pesh kiya
 According to the important changes in the Special Protection Group Act, 1988, the SPG protection shield will be provided to the current Prime Minister and close relatives living with him at the official residence
 act ke sanshodhit ho jane ke baad purv pradhanmantriyon ko SPG suraksha sirf paanch saal ke liye hi milegi
 Up to five years after the former Prime Minister left office, he and his family members will be given SPG protection
 iskaa takneekee arth ye bhi nikalataa he ki kisi purv pradhanmantri kaa nidhan ho jaataa he to unke parijanon ko espiji cover nahin milegaa
 This Act has also been amended earlier in 1991, 1994,1999 and 2003
 gandhi parivaar se hataaya gaya tha espiji kaverbata den ki haal main suraksha samiksha ke baad centre sarkaar ne gandhi parivaar ke sadasyon yani sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi, priyanka gandhi, priyanka ke pati robert wadra kaa espiji cover hataane kaa kadam uthaaya tha
 The SPG security cover was also withdrawn from former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 manmohan singh ko tab se central rigerv police force (CRPF) ko 'Z' suraksha cover mila hua he
 The security of this pattern is also being provided to members of the Gandhi family from 8 November
 congress netaaon ne gandhi parivaar ko mil rahaa SPG suraksha kavach waapas liye jane ke faisle kii kadi aalochana karte hue ise dwesh ke tahat kii gai karrwai bataaya
 Due to this development also the SPG (amendment) Bill was considered important
 sarkaar se jude sutron ne gandhi parivaar par nishaanaa saadhaa ki unki ore se espiji cover ke liye jaruri niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 There have been many occasions when he himself set aside SPG security as per his wish
 SPG kaa gathan 1985 main hua tha
 After the assassination of Indira Gandhi on 31 October 1984, there was a need to form a special group for the protection of the Prime Minister
 SPG act 1988 main paas huasansad main SPG act 1988 main paas hua
 It was formed as a group dedicated to the protection of the Prime Minister
 shuruyaat main act main purv pradhanmantri iske daayre main nahin the
 Later amendments brought the former Prime Ministers under the purview of SPG protection
 1989 main veepi singh sarkaar ne purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi se SPG cover waapas le liya tha
 In 2003, the Vajpayee government amended the SPG Act again

 The BCCI Working Committee meeting in Kolkata had to be canceled on the issue of N
 Srinivasan
 tamilnadu cricket sangh ke adhyaksh ke taur par en shrinivasana varking cameti main shaamil hai, lekin chennai super kings ke masale par unki bhoomika par jis tarah se supreme court ne aitraaj jataayaa, use dekhte hue kuch sadsy unke baithak main shaamil hone kaa virodh kar rahe the
 Now the BCCI has said that it will take instructions from the Supreme Court about n Srinivasan whether he can attend the meeting or not
 bisisiai kii salanaa aam baithak (agm) 27 sitambar ko hone vaali he
 Whether Srinivasan will be able to participate in this meeting will be decided on the direction of the Supreme Court
 agar supreme court ne bisisiai kii baithak main en shrinivasana ke bhaag lene par bhi aitraaj jataayaa yaa phir bisisiai ke adhyaksh jagmohan daalamia kaa saath nahin mila, to isisi chairman kaa unka pad bhi khatre main pad jayega
 The comments haalanki bisisiai ke andar abhi bhi shrinivasana ko kai sadasyon kaa samarthan hasil he
 Srinivasan is also trying his best to complete his tenure as ICC chief
 haalanki iske liye jaruri hoga ki unhen daalamia kaa puraa saath mili
 If the Supreme Court does not object, it is very likely that Dalmiya will support Srinivasan
 shrinivasana june, 2014 main isisi chairman bane the or unka kaarykaal do saalon kaa he
 During his tenure, he has strengthened the dominance of the BCCI, the Australian Cricket Board and the English Cricket Board
 ab bisisiai kii ore se kaha gaya he ki vah en shrinivasana ke bare main supreme court se nirdesh legi ki kya ve baithak bhaag le sakate hai yaa nahin
 The BCCI Annual General Meeting (AGM) is scheduled to be held on 27 September
 is baithak main shrinivasana bhaag le paaenge yaa nahin, yah supreme court ke nirdesh par tay hoga
 If the Supreme Court objected to n Srinivasan's participation in the BCCI meeting or did not join BCCI President Jagmohan Dalmiya, then his post of ICC chairman would also be in danger
 tippaniyan However, Srinivasan still has the support of many members within the BCCI
 shrinivasana bhi puri koshish kar rahe hai ki isisi ke pramukh ke taur par apana kaarykaal puraa karen
 However, it will be necessary that they get full support of Dalmiya
 agar supreme court ne aitraaj nahin jataayaa to bahut sambhav he ki daalamia, shrinivasana kaa hi saath denge
 Srinivasan became the ICC chairman in June 2014 and has a tenure of two years
 apane kaarykaal main unhone bisisiai, australian cricket board or english cricket board ke dabadabe ko majboot banaaya he

 In the second innings of the Modi government, many things are surprising
 agar pichhali sarkaar se tulana karen to sabhi mahatvapurn mantralayon main, jo cabinet cameti on security (CCS) main bhi shaamil hote hai, bade badlaav hue hai
 The Prime Minister himself is the head of this committee
 iske alaava grih mantralay, vitt mantralay, raksha mantralay or videsh mantralay iske tahat aate hai
 Major changes were seen in the beginning of the second term of the Modi government
 purv raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ko vitt mantralay diya gaya he
 With this, she has become the first full-time female finance minister of India
 iske pehle indira gandhi jab pradhanmantri thim to unhone vitt mantralay kaa atirikt prabhaar apane paas hi rakhaa tha
 Former Foreign Secretary S
 Jaishankar, a non-political figure, has been assigned to the Ministry of External Affairs
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko grih mantralay kii jimmedaari di gai he
 At the same time, Rajnath Singh has been given the Ministry of Defense, which was earlier with Nirmala Sitharaman
 itihaas main jhanken to ham paaenge ki desh main sabase zyada pradhanmantri, sabase zyada jansankhya vaale uttar pradesh rajya se bane
 The India Today Data Intelligence Unit investigated which state the leaders with the most powerful ministry come from
 chunki cabinet cameti on security main hi sabase taqatvar mantralay aate hai, isliye hamane apane vishleshan main inhen chaar mantralayon ko shaamil kiya he
 Uttar Pradesh is the state with the highest number of ministers, which has proved to be the factory of not only the Prime Minister but also the cabinet ministers
 chaar sabase mahatvapurn mantralayon main grih, raksha or videsh mantralay main sabase zyada mantri uttar pradesh se bane hai
 Uttar Pradesh has so far given seven Home Ministers, eight Defense Ministers and six Foreign Ministers
 yah anya kisi bhi rajya ke mukaable sabase zyada he
 So far, there have been 30 Home Ministers in the country, of which seven are from Uttar Pradesh, six are from Maharashtra and three are from Gujarat, Punjab and Tamil Nadu
 telugana or madhya pradesh ne desh ko do-do grahamantri die hai, jabaki haryana, jammu-kashmir karnataka, pashchim bengal se ek-ek grahamantri hue hai
 Indira Gandhi also took charge of the Ministry of Home Affairs during her tenure as Prime Minister
 unhen chhod diya jaae to kabhi kisi mahila saansad ko yah mantralay nahin diya gaya
 Former Jammu and Kashmir CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed is the only Muslim leader who held the post of Home Minister during 1989-1990
 raksha mantralayadesh main abhi tak 29 raksha mantri rah chuke hai
 Most of them have also been from UP
 ab tak aath raksha mantri upi se rah chuke hai, jabaki maharashtra or tamilnadu se chaar-chaar raksha mantri rahe
 Nirmala Sitharaman became the first woman defense minister in the country
 ab ve pehali mahila vitt mantri bhi ban gai hai
 She was made the defense minister during the cabinet reshuffle in 2017
 videsh mantralayabharat main ab tak kul 28 videsh mantri ho chuke hai
 Most of them have also been from Uttar Pradesh
 28 videsh mantriyon main chah uttar pradesh se, chaar punjab se, teen bihar se, do telugana se, do maharashtra se or do rajasthan se
 Sushma Swaraj was the first woman foreign minister in the last Modi government
 vitt mantralvaham mantralayon main se yah ek maatr mantralay he jisamen sankhya ke maamle main upi kaa dabadabaa nahin rahaa

 In this hopeless country, even if there is such a thing as the Guantanamo detention camp of Americans, what would anyone want? a mention of this can create a storm of moderate rains
 lekin jorge bush ke naitik krodhonmad kaa yah pratik aaj bhi, baraak obama ke baavjood vajood main bana hua he
 The idea of indian Gitmo could be just a fantasy of a right-wing warrior or an expression of the wrath of those who believe that the enemies of the Indian polity - from the freedom fighters to the gun-waving revolutionaries who have picked up the books of theory - are the safest and most secure It is the most suitable shelter
 vaise, jis desh ko hatyaron ke vajood kaa ehsaas karaane ke liye 9 / 11 jaise cond kii jarurat nahin padi he, vahaan gitmo kaa mahimagon bahut aswabhaavik nahin lagata
 We have gone through this
 agar yah jivan bharat ko asahneeya nahin lagata to isaki vajah yah he ki hamaare bheetar nirlyptata kaa jo rashtriya gun he, uske kaaran ham un logon ke prati itane sahaj ho chuke hai jo swatantraaa ke khilaaf yuddh karne ke liye yahaan kii swatantraaa kaa bharpoor istemaal karte hai
 These can be considered as ideal candidates for Guantanamo which we do not have
 ye sab utane hi aaazaad hai jitne saiyad ali shah gilaani, jo totami bharat virdohi hai
 All practical — or can we call it futuristic? —that has caused this elderly man to be the Ayatollah of the Valley, even though his white beard is not as wavy as that of Iran's original Ayatollah
 unki rashtriyata bhale hi bhartiya ho, jo ek takneekee jarurat he, lekin unki aazaadee kii ladaai ke vyapak daayre main yah ek bhugolic abhishaap or itihaas sambandhi vipadaa he
 They pronounce the word Bharat as if it is a foreign devil who is an enemy of their faith, bound in bonds

 Following the Khomeiniist tradition of starting jihad on the news of offending piety, they provoke Islamic outrage against unprotected infidels by pretending to burn the Quran on the ninth anniversary of the infamous 9 / 11 scandal in America

 Why can't we call them terrorists? And why can't they behave the same way with them? Is it because the government needs them in view of its efforts to pacify the people of Kashmir and its struggle for all-party meetings? Or is it because they have forced India-occupied power and their armies - which are among the few things in this republic which have not been politicized - to be a point of this deal? The answer to these questions will not reveal anything new about this man who has declared war against India and for whom arms are provided with the freedom that is available to him as a citizen of India
 kisi bhi duusare aatankwaadi kii tarah ve ekayami hai
 However, the answers to the above questions undoubtedly reveal a lot about India, which is embroiled in a suicidal vicious circle of political justification
 yahi vajah he ki vah gilaani kii muhim ke asli paath ko nahin pard paata
 To assume that there is no religious adjective associated with their war against their own country, that money — or believe development — can win the mind of freedom fighters inspired by the holy scripture, will have to abstain from national responsibility and concession Will have to take shelter of the deception to achieve peace through or un mahashay ko to ek hi riyaayat chahie-aupniveshik takat se kashmir kii aa

 History gives us something else - such disputes are decided by the exclusivist
 bhartiya loktantr kii ek sabase badi uplabdhi yah he ki isamen itihaas se baahar jivit rahane kii ascharyajanak kshamta he
 This is the reason why we repeatedly ignore the real issue, although the person who should be included in the list of 'seekers' of the country by law does not ignore anything
 uske uksaave se sadakon par bavaal much jaataa he, hinsa ke aankade upar chadhane lagate hai, aazaadee or jihad main puraa talmail ho jaataa he
 They set the agenda and New Delhi takes cognizance of it
 agar 9 / 11 ke baad aatankwaad apni takat bhay ke dohan or aasthaa ke nakaarwaad se hasil karata he, to gilaani ko aaj sabase aasakt or kargar aatankwaadi mana ja saktaa he
 And the most surprising thing is that he who is a victim of them is enamored with them
 yaa ho saktaa he ki yah bahut ascharyajanak baat na ho, agar ham yah dekhen ki aatank kaa nunatam rashtrahit main upyog karne or adhiktam raajnneetik dohan karne main bharat kaa record kaisaa rahaa he
 The independence that Gilani enjoys can be compared to the privileges acquired to the so-called Maoists whose bloodshed — particularly in tribal areas — have forced India to adopt a defensive posture
 unke maamle main bhi vikaas ke usee ubaau tark ne rashtriya suraksha ke masale ko khokhale saamaajik naare main badalakar rakh diya he
 Here too, those who are challenging the Republic for the sake of saving the surroundings of the villages are being treated as if our national development has pushed them into the category of orphans

 Nevertheless, we are cursed to watch the horror shows of some Congress leaders whose social conscience suffers from a closed mindset
 unhen desh ganvaana to gavaara ho saktaa he, chunaav ganvaana nahin
 Now they are busy in deciding the color of terrorism so that it is politically friendly
 yah to nishchit hi he ki jab peedit se dgayada hamalavar raajnneetik ahmayit rakhata ho tab is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki peedit sainik he yaa aam naagarik, aatank kaa samaan bantwaaraa raajnneetik jarurat ban jaati he
 That is why "saffron" terrorism suddenly becomes the answer to terrorism
 yah itnaa asann aatank he jiske dharmik rang kaa zikr karne se ham buree tarah kataraate hai kyonki kahin yah un logon kii samvednaa ko aahat na kar de jo is ghisi-pity bakawaas kaa dhol peetate rahete hai ki aatankwaad kaa koi dharm nahin hota
 Of course it has a religion, and its approval is not only seen in the clogged videotape
 in anumodanon ko hamane alag-alag naatakeey andaajon main neuyork or landan main, bali or madrid main, mumbai or jaipur main, dilli or ahmedabad main dekha
 We see them repeating in a horrific manner on the streets of Kashmir

 If terrorism is studied from the political perspective, it will only provide more security to the Gilani and Maoists and weaken India further
 aatankwaad se peedit bharat jaisaa durbhaagyashaalee koi bhi desh nahin hoga jise vahi log kamjor kar rahe hai jinhen uski raksha karne kii sanvaidhanik jimmedaari saunpi gai he

 Moving away from the party line, Janata Dal United (JDU) national vice president Prashant Kishore is also protesting
 prashanth kishor ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki sansad membehumatabarkaraar rahaa
 He said that now, beyond the judiciary, the responsibility of saving the soul of India rests with the Chief Ministers of 16 non-bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governed states, who will implement the law

 The majority prevailed in Parliament
 Now beyond judiciary, the task of saving the soul of India is on 16 non-bjp cms as it is the states who have to operationalise these acts
 3 cms (punjab / Kerala / WB) have said NO to # caband # NRC
 Time for others to make their stand clear

 We are told that # cabis bill to grant citizenship and not to take it from anyone
 But the truth is together with # NRC, it could turn into a lethal combo in the hands of Government to systematically discriminate and even prosecute people based on religion
 # notgivingup— Prashant Kishor (@prashantkishor) December 12, 2019 Explain that soon after JDU President Nitish Kumar supported this bill, PK opened the front against it
 pike ne twit kar virodh jataayaa or likhaa ki bill kaa samarthan karne se pehle party netritv ko 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bharosa jataane vaali janata ke bare main bhi sochna chahie tha
 While supporting # CAB, the JDU leadership should spare a moment for all those who reposed their faith and trust in it in 2015
 We must not forget that but for the victory of 2015, the party and its managers wouldn’t have been left with much to cut any deal with anyone
 - Prashant Kishor (@prashantkishor) December 11, 2019 JDU supported this bill in both houses

 com / ijj5sb55lf On Sunday, an Indian priest in Australia became a victim of racism
 melbern carch main padri 48 varshiya rev tommy kailathur mathew par ravivaar ko 72 varshiya vyakti ne hamalaa kiya
 The clergy were going to address the church on Sunday
 sthaneey media reports ke anusaar vyakti ke dwaara padri par isliye hamalaa kiya gaya kyonki vah bhartiya mul kaa tha, use laga ki vah yaa to vah hindu hai yaa muslim
 That is why he was attacked
 ravivaar ko 11wein italian bhashaa ke sambodhan main jane se pehlepadri kii gardanpar waar kiya gaya, padri tommy ko abhi aspataal main bhartee kiya gaya he
 Significantly, in the past several days, there has been an increase in attacks on Indians in countries like Australia and America
 dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal ab sabhi sansthaaon ke saath talkh rishton ko behatar karne kii koshish karte dikhaai de rahe hai
 Arvind Kejriwal has been trying to improve relations with the Lieutenant Governor's office for the last few days, having been steadfastly building relations with the Lieutenant Governor's residence since the formation of the government
 pichley kai dinon se kejariwal lagaataar uparajyapal ke saath samvaad sthapit kar gaahe-bagaahe unki tarif bhi kar rahe hai
 At the same time, Kejriwal is seen to have a better relationship with the Election Commission after sharing the tics with the Election Commission after the debacle in the Punjab Assembly and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi
 chunaav ayog ke sutron ke mutabik ayog ab harvidhansabhaor loksabhaa chunaav main iviem ke nateezon kii vivipat trail kii parchiyon se teli karana chahta he
 This proposed step of the Election Commission was openly welcomed by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and praised the Election Commission fiercely
 kejariwal ne twitor par likhaa, 'main chunaav ayog ke is faisle ke liye badhai dena chahta hum
 This decision will help clear the confusion about evms

 com / zx3ejduznt — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) July 6, 2017 According to Election Commission sources, the Election Commission is now in every Assembly and Lok Sabha election for every Assembly and Lok Sabha seat, after questions on its credibility and complaints of malfunctions in evms
 5% will tally the results of evms and results of VVPAT slips at polling booths
 reports ke mutabik yah teli 14 poling boothon se zyada or 5 se kam poling boothon par nahin kii jaaegi or sabhi poling booth chunaav ayog dwaara chayan kiye jaaenge
 Sources even say that due to this process there can be a delay of about 3 hours in the results of every election
 punjab vidhansabha chunaav main haar jhelane ke baad aam aadmi party or kejariwal ne iviem main gadabadiyon kaa hawala dete hue chunaav ayog par jamkar hamale kiye the
 Not only this, during campaigning in the Assembly elections, Kejriwal raised serious questions on the Election Commission and its credibility, but now Kejriwal does not want to get involved with anyone
 mamata banerjee ke pashchim bengal main mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaale aparaadh main baari ijapha dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 The latest case is in the state's North 24 Parganas district, where a minor committed suicide after a molestation incident
 ladki ke parijanon ke mutabik unka ek padosi jiskaa naam gautam paswan bataaya ja rahaa he, kai maheenon se peedita ko tang kar rahaa tha
 Eventually she tried to accomplish her disgusting intentions after which the 17-year-old girl ended her life
 mana ja rahaa he ki peedita is vaardaat ke sadame ko bardaasht nahin kar saki or pankhe se latakkar apni jaan de di
 This case is related to Palbagan Slum of Naihati area of north 24 Parganas district
 gaur karne vaali baat he ki is jile main mahilaon kii asmita ke saath khilwaad kaa yah pehla maamla nahin he
 The Barasat rape and murder case also took place in this area
 peedita ke padosiyon ne bataaya ki mangalvaar shaam ko aaropee gautam jabardastee karke ladki ke ghar ghus aayaa
 At that time the girl's younger brother was present in the house, which the accused drove away and locked the room from inside
 iske baad aaropee peedita ke saath shaareerik dushkarm karne kii koshish karne laga
 During this time, other neighbors heard the screaming of the girl
 jab ve ladki ko bachaane uske ghar pahunche to aaropee bhaagane main kaamyaab ho gaya
 At this time, the girl's parents had gone out for work
 jab ve ghar laute, unhone apni beti ke sharir ko pankhe se lataka hua paaya
 The victim was then rushed to the nearby Naihati State Hospital where doctors declared her dead
 peedita ke pita ne aaropee gautam paswan ke khilaaf police main shikaayat darj karai he
 The accused is still absconding
 chunaav ayog ne aaj aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ko kaaran bataao notice jari kiya he
 This notice was given due to his alleged remarks in Amethi, which stated that a single vote cast in favor of the Congress and the BJP would be 'god and betrayal from the country'
 ayog ne unke dwaara adarsh aachaar samhita kaa pratham drushtya ulanghan karne kii ore dhyaan dilaate hue unhen apana paksh rakhane ke liye 13 may kii shaam tak kaa samay diya he
 In the absence of reply, the commission will take a decision in the matter without giving any reference to them
 ayog ne bijepi kii is shikaayat par karrwai kii he ki 2 may ko amethi main kejariwal ne ek jansabha main kathith rup se kaha tha, 'amethi main agar koi congress ko vot degaa, to bura mat maniega (is tippanee ke liye), vah desh se dhokhaa karegaa
 
 kya maine bahut zyada kah diya
 
 main ek baar phir kahuunga ki agar congress yaa bhaajapa kaa ek bhi vot daalaa gaya, to yah khuda or desh ke saath gaddari hogi
 ' chunaav ayog ko unki kathith tippanee vaali ek sidi muhaiyaa karai gai he
 The notice stated, '
 
 It is the prima facie opinion of the Commission that you have violated the model code of conduct by making a statement
 ' Kashmir changed forever on August 5, 2019
 rajya kaa bantwaaraa iske taabut main aakhri keel tha
 The new Kashmir, which is the hope of Sheikh Abdullah's dream, is now buried
 yahaan tak ki vaajapeyi kii soch ''inasaaniyat, kashmiriat, jamhuriyat'' ko alavida kah diya gaya
 The state will soon disappear and be replaced by Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir
 ab dekhnaa he ki is khaak se dilli kaisaa kashmir taiyaar kar paati he, jo kabhi paanchvaan sabase bada rajya tha
 Of course, it will not only require military deployment, but will also require a lot of imagination
 kuch sanakiyon kii najar main to kashmir 9 agast,1953 main shaikh abdulla kii giraftaar ke vakt se hi prabhavi taur par centreshasit tha
 The long queues of chief ministers who followed him were seen in Kashmir like puppets in Delhi — just Dr
 faruk abdulla ko 1983 main hataae jane ke pehle unke chote-se kaarykaal ko maaf kar sakate hai
 Even Sheikh Abdullah Saheb, who returned to power after the 1975 agreement with Delhi, was left full of his old stature
 bahut saare kashmiriyon ko lambey samay se shaq rahaa he or mirvij to jaahir bhi karte rahe hai ki dilli ko bas kashmir kii jameen main dilchaspee he, vahaan ke logon main nahin
 Those fears seem to be proved right
 bakaul shah faisal, gulam banane kaa asli cheharaa khulkar saamne aa gaya he
 Yet the Kashmiris were so confident in Delhi that until the last moment, even in the meeting of the party leaders of the Valley on 4 August, they did not think that this could happen
 kanoon visheshgy mujffar beg ne to samvidhan ko haath main uthaae aisi hi daleel di
 The most painful sight is the severely broken Dr
 faruk abdulla kaa tha, jo un doston se madad kii apil kar rahe the, jinke saath ve hameshaa khadey rahe hai
 In one stroke, Delhi nested the entire Kashmiri leadership
 yahaan tak ki dilli ke pasandida chehre sajaad lone kii bhi havaaiyaan ud gayi, jo kabhi modi ko apana 'bada bhai' kah chuke hai
 After getting rid of mainstream politics, some extremists have started saying that the fight is now between them and Delhi
 kuch vakt baad dilli kaa pratinidhi koi up-rajyapal hoga or nai chuni hui sarkaar hogi
 But, as Mani Shankar Aiyar has rightly said, there can now be a Palestinian forever inhabiting our northern border
 ghati main puri tarah bandi ke baavjood atakalein dhadlle se ud rahi hai
 Fear of indefinite intifada has become common in Kashmir with the help of jihadists from Pakistan and Afghanistan, a new group of fidayeen attackers is emerging and land grab outsiders are preparing to enter
 haalanki ghati ke logon ko pakistan se koi ummid nahin dikh rahi
 As a budding Kashmiri leader said, Pakistan is more like an NGO, a paper tiger whose plans to send people across the border will be lost in the blockages of the Neelum River
 pakistan 9 / 11 ko hi kashmir ko ganvaa chukaa he, jab jorge dablyoo
 Bush instructed General Pervez Musharraf to change course
 tab kashmiriyon ko laga ki pakistan jab apni raksha khud nahin kar saktaa to hamaari madad kya khaak karegaa
 Pakistan's return to Kashmir is a result of the killing of Burhan Wani and subsequent military deployment
 jo halaat hai, shaayad usamen yahi ummid kii ja sakati he ki kashmir main koi aam aadmi party jaisaa kuch ubhare, lekin ilaake kii mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti ko diwalia kar dene kii bhul baari padegi
 Article 370 had already become hollow, there was only one thing left for the Kashmiris to believe, it was extremely unnecessary to disarm it
 apane mehmaan kaa katl karne ke pehle makebeth ke man main uthe sawaalon ke ulat anuchhed 370 ko bina kisi hichak ke vidaa kar diya gaya
 The most humiliating state for Kashmiris has to be converted into a union territory
 dilli ko gaur karne kii jarurat he ki kashmir ko saath rakhane ke liye vah ek baar phir use rajya kaa darja behaal karne par vichaar kare
 Negotiations are undoubtedly important, perhaps this is the right time to talk to Pakistan as well

 There is a powerful bomb blast near the assembly here in Quetta

 The blast occurred on the Jargoon Road in Quetta, about 300 meters from the assembly

 In which an attempt has been made to mainly target the police vehicle

 However, the session was adjourned after the Chief Minister resigned

 According to media reports, a suicide bomber who was riding a motorcycle was trying to target the Balochistan assembly building, but exploded in the high security Red Zone area
 jahaan ye visphot kiya gaya vahaan badi sankhya main surakshakarmi maujuud the, kyonki baluchistan vidhansabha kaa ek satr bas sampann hi hua tha

 tel kii lagaataar badhati keemton se sabhi pareshaan hai
 The government is citing rising crude oil prices in the international market
 baat to sahi he magar yah samasya kaa hal nahin he
 It may be that in the coming days due to Iran crisis, the prices of crude oil may increase even more
 sarkaar ko is par lagaam lagaani hi hogi, magar sabase bada sawaal he kaise? The problem is that even when the prices of crude oil were low in the international market, the Indian government did not reduce the price of oil and kept filling its treasury
 ab sarkaar ke ek kendriya mantri ne daleel di he ki tel kii badi keemton se jo paisa sarkaar ke paas aa rahaa he vah sadak banane or anya janhit yojanaon main kharch kiya jaataa he
 The government increased the excise duty of oil 9 times from November 2014 to February 2016, although the prices of crude oil were low in the international market at that time
 is dauraan sarkaar ne samay-samay par 12 ru 2 paise petrol kii keemten badhaai jabaki isi dauraan sarkaar ne dijal kii keemton main 13 ru 7 paise kaa ijapha kiya
 On one hand, the government has increased oil prices 9 times, while it has also reduced once
 4 oktober 2017 ko petrol or dijal kii keemton main 2-2 rupye kam kiye gaye
 In such a situation, the statement of FICCI President Rajesh Shah is important in which he said that the total excise duty has been increased by 11 rupees 77 paise per liter on petrol and 13 rupees 47 paise on diesel while only Rs 2 per liter has been reduced
 isliye exise duty ghataane kii gunjaish he
 The comments is sabake bich aap yah jaan kar chaunk jaaenge ki apane desh kii tel companiyon ke munaafe kaa kya haal he
 Usually, in such a situation, these companies should be in bad shape, but it is not so
 indian oil kaa munafa march 2013 main 5 hajaar karod tha jo ki 2017 main bad kar 19 hajaar karod or march 2018 main 21 hajaar karod ho gaya
 Not only this, state governments also have a hand in increasing the price of oil, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh have more than 35% VAT per liter
 darasal rajya sarkarein bhi tel par apana munafa chhodana nahin chaahati hai
 If people get relief in such a situation, how can we get it sabase pehle kendra or rajya sarkaron ko tel companiyon ke saath baithak kar apana munafa thodaa thodaa kam karnaa padegaa jisase ki aam logon ko raahat mil sake
 Otherwise, the international market oil prices will be on fire
 is saal sarkaar kaa tel bill 20 fisadi tak bad saktaa he
 The oil bill currently at $ 88 billion can go up to $ 105 billion
 aise main raahat kii ummid kam hi rakhni chahie yadi sarkaar apana munafa kam karti he to phir raahat kii ummid kii ja sakati he

 Amidst all this, you will be shocked to know how is the profitability of the oil companies of your country
 amuman aise halaat main in companiyon kii buree haalat honi chahie magar aisa he nahin
 Indian Oil's profit was 5 thousand crores in March 2013, which increased to 19 thousand crores in 2017 and 21 thousand crores in March 2018
 yahi nahin, tel kii keemat badhaane main rajya sarkaron kaa bhi haath hota he maharashtra, madhyapradesh, andhrapradesh main prati litre 35 fisadi se adhik waite he
 Actually the state governments also do not want to give up their profits on oil
 aise haalat main logon ko raahat mili to mili kaise
 First of all, the central and state governments will have to reduce their profits slightly by meeting with the oil companies so that the common people can get relief
 varanaa jo halaat hai antarrashtriya bazaar kii tel kii keemton main aag lagi rahegi
 This year, the government's oil bill may increase by 20 percent
 abhi jo tel kaa bill 88 arab dollar he, vah 105 arab dollar tak ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the hope of relief should be kept low, if the government reduces its profit then relief can be expected
 darasal rajya sarkarein bhi tel par apana munafa chhodana nahin chaahati hai
 If people get relief in such a situation, how can we get it sabase pehle kendra or rajya sarkaron ko tel companiyon ke saath baithak kar apana munafa thodaa thodaa kam karnaa padegaa jisase ki aam logon ko raahat mil sake
 Otherwise, the international market oil prices will be on fire
 is saal sarkaar kaa tel bill 20 fisadi tak bad saktaa he
 The oil bill currently at $ 88 billion can go up to $ 105 billion

 mujhe khushi ho rahi he ki ham sahi samay par baar se nikal gaye or uski madad ke liye samay par vahaan maujuud the
 'both players believe that the person was from Britain
 usne apana phone, passport or purse pani main phenk diya tha
 According to the information, at first when the players saw the person, they thought that he was standing on the railing of the bridge, but later they realized the seriousness of the situation
 donon khilaadi mangalvaar raat ‘barmi army’ ke charity ke liye dhan ekatrit karne ke liye yojit kaarykram se laut rahe the
 Team security officer Terry Minisch also helped Pryor prevent the man from suicide
 minish ne kaha, ‘hotel jate samay, hamane us yuva ko pul ke kinare khadey hue dekha, jo kudane hi vaala tha
 Prior pulled her from the side of the bridge and kept talking to her until police arrived
 yah sab bahut teji se hua tha
 ' varsh 2014 main jab malaysia kaa hawaii jahaaz emech 370 achaanak laapata ho gaya tha to kai dinon tak uski talash or yatriyon kii zindagi khabaron main pramukhataa se chhaae rahe
 No one knows where that plane went and what happened to the passengers
 kul 239 log us par savaar the jisamen se 227 yatri the
 The probability of survival of anyone is slim
 yah ghatana bhale hi itihaas ho gai ho lekin isane khabaron kii duniya main bhuuchaal laa diya tha
 The eyes of the world were based on this news for weeks
 aisa hi ek drishy patna-indore express ke kanpur ke paas hue haadase kaa bhi he
 The death toll has so far crossed 145
 isse bhi zyaada log ghayal hai, jisamen kaiyon kii haalat gambhir bani hui he
 This is definitely news on Hindi channels and newspapers, but if you look at the internet statistics, the readership of English is indifferent to it
 usne ghatana ke bare main jaan liya
 Took information and just moved on
 to kyarel durghatana main mare logkya hamaare liye mahaj sankhyaayein hai jinhen kisi match ke score yaa taarikh ke kalendar kii tarah dekh lenaa bhar kaaphi he
 Have we become so insensitive and indifferent that dying and injuring such a large number of people does not distract us
 yaa phir aisa isliye he kyonki is haadase main maare gaye log mahange daam ke tikaton par yatra nahin kar rahe the, hawaii jahaaz jaisi parivahan kii sabase tej, viksit or aadhunik pranali kaa istemaal nahin kar rahe the jisamen duniyabar ke saadhan sampann log safar karte hai
 Those who died in the accident were in second class coaches of the sleeper class
 zaahir he ki ye aam janata hai, kam aay or saste tikaton par yatra karanevaale garib, vidhyaarthee, kaamgaar hai
 They are as important as sheep for such a large democracy in India
 yah kaisaa shikshit or samvedansheel madhyamvarg he jo jabatak apane varg par chot na ho, kisi kii maut ko bhi dard se nahin dekhtaa
 What kind of selfishness does it want to recognize the value of people's lives on the basis of clothes, money and rank? rail kii patariyon par kagaz kii tarah bikhare pade dibbon ko kaat katkar logon ko baahar nikaala ja rahaa he
 People are dying by coming out
 bacchon ke paas pita kaa naam bataane tak kii chetana nahin he
 The mother has become dumb with a picture of her children in her hand
 bujurg apane nae khun ko apni ankhon ke aage shant hota dekh rahe hai
 In this pain, nothing is being said and heard or seen except politics, expressway, fighter aircraft, parliament and slogans
 jis vakt is haadase main log maut se jujh rahe the or madad kii aas lagaae ek-ek saans jivan kaa intazaar kar rahe the, kanpur se thodi duuri par pradhanmantri samvednaa ke do shabdon ke baad apni yojanaon kaa prachaar or vidhansabha chunaav ke liye loklubhaavan bhaashan de rahe the
 The victims were helped late and so the number of dead increased
 zindagi ke liye aspataal main jujhate logon ko band ho chuke note raahat ke taur par baant die gaye
 Some distance from the accident, the government of the state was busy in launching its great road project
 sarkaar se lekar vipaksh tak in prabhaviton ke liye sirf dukh or afsos kii aupchaarikta ke shabd hai or kuch bhi nahin
 Imagine that this news would have been from a metropolis
 dilli kii metro main yaa kisi paanch sitara hotel main aisa koi haadasa ho jaataa to angrezi ke tamaam channel apni sari shakti isapar jhonk dete
 The middle class would only get wet in its discussion
 sattapaksh or vipaksh bade-bade bayaan or pradarshan kar rahe hote
 If the accident had taken place on a plane instead of this train, the whole country would have been listening to it
 to kya jivan kaa mulya hamaari aay or sampannataa ke aadhaar par hi tay hota rahegaa
 If the governments of the Center and the states were really shaken after this accident, the work from relief to the search of family could have been speeded up
 ham aise samay main ji rahe hai jab bullate train kaa sapana is haadase se zyaada ahm khabar he or zyaada dikhaaya sunaaya jaataa he
 From the power side and also from the media
 afsos ki hawa main sapane oochhaalane ke daur main ham buniyadi sawaalon par shant hai
 Governments are selling dreams
 koi express ve par fiter vimaan utaar rahaa he to koi japan jaisi bullate train kii taiyaari main laga he
 But during this time, the poll of railway infrastructure is going to open such deaths and we are moving our eyes blindly on these deaths
 kanpur main hua rail haadasaeq bada haadasa he or isko bada haadasa na maananaa ek badi bhul he
 Neither humanity nor the Constitution offers scope for this mistake
 lekin maut garib kii ho to badi bhoolen mritkon kii sankhyaayein bhar rah jaati he
 The burning of our consciousness before the funeral pyre in the crematorium is an example of this

 Darylas, Uma Bharti, who reached Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh on a short tour of her day, made this statement while talking to the media
 shanivaar subah uma bharti ujjain pahunchi or pehle mahakaal mandir jaakar darshan kiye
 After that Uma Bharti was meeting with reporters at the circuit house
 usee dauraan ajtak ke sawaal par uma bharti ne ye pratikriya di
 When Uma Bharti was asked that Shah Rukh Khan was kept in the US for hours to check security at the airport, in response, Uma Bharti said that one thing will be good with such a case, they will start liking India

 ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ke liye banane ja rahe trust kaa adhyaksh sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ko banane kii uth rahi maangon par vishwa hindu parishad ne bada bayaan diya he
 Speaking to reporters here, Champat Rai, the vhp's national vice-president who was a campaigner of the Sangh, rejected such demands and said that Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat should not be in the trust
 haalanki unhone patrakaron ko isko lekar koi kaaran nahin bataaya
 Later, a VHP national official said, "the top officials of the Sangh do not believe in being part of any trust themselves
 sangh main aisi parampara bhi nahin rahi he
 Even if he puts forward a proposal in front of the Sangh chief, he will refuse it
 "bataa den ki beete dinon mahant paramhans maharaj ne rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke pramukh mohan bhagwat ko ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ke liye banane vaale trust kaa adhyaksh banane kii maang kii thi
 He said that for this he (mahant Paramahamsa) can also sit on hunger strike
 aise main vihip ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh jab nagpur daure par pahunche to patrakaron ne isse judaa sawaal kar diya
 In response, he said that Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat should not become the president of Ram Temple Trust
 vihip ke ek padaadhikari ne kaha, "sangh ke prachaarak yaa varisht padaadhikari samaaj ke kaam ko samaaj ke logon ke jariye hi aage badhaane main vishwaas rakhte hai
 He does not find it appropriate to take a position in the trust himself " The questions posed by Jashodaben Modi on the pretext of RTI stem from decades of silent practice of an Indian woman
 vaise to unhone police captain se yahi poocha he ki protocol kaa matlab kya hota he or puraa protocol mili to vah kitna bada hoga
 It is also feared that their security personnel will not become enemies of their lives
 vah yah poochne se bhi nahin rukeen kii pradhanmantri kii patni ke kya adhikaar hote hai? koi or vakt hota to ye sawaal shaayad badi aasaani se aae-gaye ho jate, lekin isse do-chaar din pehle hi to shrimati modi ne kaha tha ki agar modiji phone lagaakar bulaayenge to vah pradhanmantri nivas main aane ko taiyaar hai
 In such a situation, the question is that the silence which had been going on for four decades started breaking up today
 If the nationalist Maithilisharan had been incognito, he might have given a more accurate voice to Jasodaben's suffering
 kyonki hindi ke aadhunik sahitya main vahi aise sarjak hai jinhone urmila or yashodhara jaisi un vanchit nayikaon ko ooncha sthaan dilaayaa, jinke hisse main pati kii tarakkee ke liye sirf or sirf tyaag karnaa bada tha
 Jashodaben's story is similar

 In this interview in the Indian Express, Jasoda Ben had said that the only request from his late mother is that Modiji should become Prime Minister and progress
 (dhyaan rahe ki is intervyuu ke liye photo khinchane se shrimati modi ne manaa kar diya tha
 ) After this Modiji himself filled the food of his election nomination, in which the name of the wife has to be written
 isse pehle vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan ve is khaane ko khaali chhodte rahe the
 This was the first time for the future Prime Minister of the country to get married and officially address his wife from the world
 jaraa sochie jab ye sari chijen dashakon baad pehali baar saarvajanik ho rahi hongi to shrimati modi ko kaisaa lag rahaa hoga? is danpati ne varshon pehle maan liya tha ki pati deshseva ke kaam main ja rahaa he or patni bhi is baat par rajamand he
 Both of them voluntarily gave way to each other
 lekin ab jab chaar-paanch dashak baad arany cond biit rahaa he, yani sangharsh ke din biit rahe hai
 If the tree of sacrifice is going to give fruits, should not both wish to eat that fruit
 aakhir tyaag to donon kaa tha
 Why not think that the husband's mission has been fulfilled in the mind of a woman and now Ram and Sita should sit together on the throne in Ramrajya like the Uttarakhand of Ramcharitmanas
 or jab itani lambii khamoshi ke baad aadhikarik rup se patni ke vajood ko maan hi liya gaya ho to patni ko uskaa haq mili
 (that is why he is in front of the camera now and his RTI says that it is not good to get hit in the bus and walk behind in the guard car
 )jasodaben chunaav ke samay se hi ati vinamr or bhartiya samskruti ko shobhane vaali bhashaa main is baat ke sanket de rahi thim, ki ab samay aa gaya he jab unke pati ko unki sud leni chahie
 But busy in communicating with the whole world, Modiji could not pay attention to this call
 vaise is tarah ke maamalon main kisi kaa salaah dene kaa haq nahin banataa, lekin jab maamla vyaktigat se saarvajanik ho gaya ho to bina maangi salahon se bachaa nahin ja saktaa
 In such a situation, it would be better to gradually turn the increasing thing towards happiness, which is always liked by the Indian public
 vaise bhi jab puure ek daur kaa maun tuutata he to uski rison itani jaldi band nahin hoti

 Gadkari, a senior BJP leader, was in the news recently when he appeared to be sarcastic at the saffron party's top leadership following the party's defeat in the assembly elections in three states
 maharashtra ke sholapur main patrakaron se baatcheet main pavaar ne kaha, ‘‘gadakari mere dost hai
 We have worked together
 unka naam (modi ke vikalp ke rup main) pesh kiya ja rahaa he or yahi kaaran he ki main unke liye chintit hum
 Pawar did not say anything else about it
 unhone kaha ki raaj thakare kii maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke saath unki party gathbandh ko lekar koi baat nahin kar rahi he
 Let us know that Nitin Gadkari has become a cause of concern for BJP leaders due to his statements
 halaki har baar gadakari apane bayanon ko galat tareeke se pesh karne kaa thikra media par phod dete hai
 But on his statements, opposition parties are seen attacking the Modi government
 haal hi main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne nitin gadakari ko unke bayanon ke liye sahasi bataaya tha

 In a hurry, all the big leaders of the Congress came to knock the Election Commission
 ahamed patel, ashok gahalot, randeep surajevaala, anand sharma, arpyen singh, sushmita dev, raja baraar sabhi der raat sava nau baje kendriya chunaav ayog main najar aae
 The FIR is canceled and if not, then in this case Prime Minister Modi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Union Minister Piyush Goyal and BJP President Amit Shah should also have an FIR on this
 lekin chunaav ayog ke bheetar kya hua uski insaide story ye he
 This is an inside story
 
 
 congress ke netaa chunaav ayogpahunche to aanan-fanan main kamishan sunwaayee ke liye taiyaar hua
 Chief Election Commissioner AK Jyoti himself was present there
 shuruyaat congress ke varisht netaa or rajyasabha main congress ke upanetaa anand sharma ne kii
 Anand Sharma took all the things that the Congress party had put in its press release, i
e
 after the implementation of the Election Code of Conduct or say that the bjp's manifesto was released on 8th of the time after the end of the election campaign, in which Arun All the leaders including Jaitley were present
 pradhanmantri modi ne 9 disambar ko chaar badi reliyaan kii
 Which was shown by all national channels including Gujarati
 buudhvaar kii piyush goyal kii press conference ayog ke saamne rakhi gai to vahiin manmohan ko jawaab detaa amit shah kaa bayaan bhi sawaalon ke ghere main laayaa gaya
 Soon after, Ashok Gehlot, who is the general secretary in-charge of Gujarat Congress, showed the video in which Prime Minister Modi was seen saying that after 9 pm and on 14 th, BJP votes on the 14th and the 14th of the election date
 Give ashok gahalot ne ayog se poocha ki kya yah chunaav aachaar samhita kaa sidhaa ulanghan nahin he or is par karrwai kyon nahin kii gai
 Then came the turn of Randeep Surjewala, the media in-charge of the Congress, who, one by one, put all things in Hindi in front of the Commission
 shaayad surajevaala jaanate the angreji main anand sharma apni baat kah chuke hai
 Mohammed Sonia Gandhi's secretary Ahmed Patel, who has been following the whole strategy behind the scenes, only said that if Kirahul Gandhi gave an interview, he would not ask for votes from the public
 congress dabaav badha rahi thi, ayog se apni nishpakshta ko sabit karne kii baat kar rahi thi
 Then the former Minister of State for Home and senior Congress leader RPN Singh said, 'just as the Election Commission had decided to cancel the vote of two mlas on the issue of Ahmed Patel in Gujarat during the Rajya Sabha elections and proved their impartiality
 Only the Election Commission can prove its dignity, this is what i request
 'iske baad ayog ne kaha ki aapane apni baat kah di ham is par jaanch-padtaal karne ke baad jaldi se jaldi faisla karenge
 In such a situation, the Congress leaders told the Commission, 'look, time is short, voting is tomorrow
 aaj der raat yaa phir kal subah hi aapako faisla lenaa hoga
 "the Commission said," We will put forth our side and action as soon as possible after the investigation
 ' isi ke baad congress netaa waapas baahar aa gaye media se mukhaatib hue
 The Congress hopes that the commission will do something
 isiilie congress ne chunaav ayog ke baahar pehle hi mahila congress ke kaaryakartaaon ke saath youth congress ke kaaryakartaaon ko bhi bula liya tha
 She was preparing that if the Commission did not listen to her and did not give her any concrete assurance, she would sit on the dharna at 11:00 pm
 lekin takreeban sava ghante ke apane dailygation se tark ke baad congress mahasoos kar rahi he ki ayog kuch naa kuch karegaa
 So she later told her Youth Congress and Mahila Congress workers to go back and leave the dharna for the moment

 We cannot force anyone to forcely raise the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai
 congress saansad shashi tharur ne bijepi ke rashtriya kaaryakarini main paarit hue raajnneetik prastaav par tippanee karte hue ye baaten kahi
 BJP in its resolution said that refusing to say Bharat Mata Ki Jai is in itself an insult to the Constitution
 kuch logon ko bharat mata kii jai se dikkatatherur ne kaha ki is bare main samajhane kii jarurat he
 Nobody has reservations about India
 log bharat mata kii jai kehane par sawaal kar rahe hai
 India can be mother to me
 kuch or logon ke liye bhi bharat mata sammaan ke laayak hai
 The large population among Hindus and Muslims has no problem with this, but some Muslims have problems
 hindu devi kii tarah hai bharat mataunhone kaha ki kuch musalamaanon ko bharat matahindu devi kii tarahalagati hai
 Hindu organizations have also made the picture of Mother India as goddess
 singh par savaar chah bhujaaon vaali devi
 They also worship him
 isse musalamaanon ko dikkat hoti he
 They say that Jai Hind will speak, Hindustan will speak Zindabad but do not tell us to speak Bharat Mata ki Jai
 hamaara loktantr or samvidhan unhen bharat mata kii jai kehane yaa nahin kehane kii aazaadee detaa he
 We should respect it
 chup rahane kaa bhi adhikaarcongress saansad ne kaha ki samvidhan hamebolne kii aazaadika adhikaar detaa he
 In the same way it also gives the right to remain silent
 ham koi shabd kisi ke munh main nahin daal sakate
 Not only in the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), but also in the Congress-led Grand Alliance, allies have started showing signs of seats
 uttar pradesh or bihar se lekar karnataka tak main paanch aise rajya hai, jinamein se kai rajyon main congress abhi tak apane sahyogi tay nahin kar saki or kai rajya aise hai jahaan sahyogi dalon ke bich seat shering ko lekar dangal machaa hua he
 The seat sharing formula has been decided between the BJP, JDU and LJP, partners of NDA in Pechbehar stuck in Bihar
 vahiin, mahagathbandhan main congress, rashtriya janata dal (argedy), upendra kushvaha kii party araspi, jithan ram maanjhi kii ham or sharad yadav shaamil hai
 Apart from these parties, the Congress is trying to link Madappura MP Pappu Yadav with himself
 sutron kii maane to maanjhi purniya loksabhaa seat par daawa kar rahe hai
 Santosh Kumar MP from JDU is now on this seat
 maanjhi kaa daawa he ki is seat par 6 lakh dalit matadaata hai, aise main ye seat unhen milani chahie
 The Congress wants Pappu Yadav to contest from Purnia instead of Madhepur so that Madhepura seat can be given to Sharad Yadav
 haalanki pappu yadav maujuuda samay main madhepura se saansad hai, lekin isse pehle purniya seat se 1996 or 1999 main chunaav jeet chuke hai
 Due to this, Purnia wants to give the seat to Pappu Yadav, but after Manjhi's claim, the Congress has fallen into a dilemma
 iske alaava argedy, congress or arales ke bich bhi abhi tak koi seat shering tay nahin ho saki he
 In Maharashtra, the Congress and NCP want to enter the Lok Sabha electoral fray in 8 seats in the case, but the agreement between the two parties has not been reached yet
 ensipi netaa ajit pavaar ne kaha ki maharashtra main 48 loksabhaa siton main se 8 ko lekar congress ke saath baatcheet puri nahin ho saki he
 These seats also include Pune and Ahmednagar seats
 jabaki congress netaa radhakrishna vikhe patil ke bete sujay vikhe patil kah chuke hai ki loksabhaa chunaav main congress agar unhen ahmednagar seat se nahin utaarti he to vah kisi anya party ke tikat par bhi chunaav lard sakate hai
 At the same time, NCP is also engaged in pressure on this seat
 karnataka main jedies ko kitni siten?karnataka main congress or jedies milakar sarkaar chalaa rahi hai, lekin 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main donon saath ladenge yaa nahin ise lekar tasviir saaf nahin he
 Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy said on Thursday that the Janata Dal (secular) has not yet discussed the issue of seat sharing with the Congress for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 uttar pradesh main koun hoga sahyogi?uttar pradesh main abhi tak tay hi nahin he ki congress kiske saath milakar chunavi maidan main utregi
 While the SP-BSP is working on a strategy to combine the Congress without taking the Congress together
 aise main hota he to phir congress ke paas akele yaa chote dalon ke saath milakar chunavi maidan main utarane kaa vikalp bachataa he
 In such a situation, the opposition unity of the Congress may suffer a major setback
 pashchim bengal main do raahe par congresspaschim bengal main congress vampanthi dalon ke saath milakar chunaav ladegi yaa phir mamata banerjee kii party tiemasi ke saath gathbandhan karegi? ise lekar tasviir saaf nahin he
 Although the Congress is running a better rapport with both the parties, it is also true that the TMC is stronger than the Left parties in Bengal politics at present

 The Sardar Narendra Modi government recently opened the doors for the private sector in bureaucracy through lateral entry for the IAS lobby also made a lateral entry
 ab joint secretary ve bhi log bhi ban sakate hai, jo civil services kii pariksha se nahin gujarey hai
 The government wants to take advantage of the experience of private sector experts in various ministries by making them joint secretaries
 letral entry system bhi beuroperesi main iees afasaron ke varchasv ko chunauti dene vaala qaraar diya ja rahaa he
 However, IAS officers or privately IAS officers have not expressed any reservations about this system

 It is noteworthy that Guru was hanged in Tihar Jail last Saturday morning
 vah 2001 main sansad bhawan par hue aatankwaadi hamale kaa doshi paaya gaya tha
 Sources say that the Prime Minister told Shinde that it is right to act against terrorism but the delay in giving information to the family of the Guru was not appropriate
 sarkaar ne faansee se ek din pehle pichley shuukravaar ko speed post ke jariye guru ke parivaar waalon ko kashmir ke sopor soochna bheji thi lekin yah speed post unhen somvaar ko mila yani faansee ke 51 ghante baad
 The Guru's family is deeply angered by not being given any prior information about the hanging because they got the news of his hanging through the media and that too after the execution

 About 160 people have died in Assam in the last three years
 ye sabhi musalamaanon (bangladesh se aae kathith ghuspaithiyon) or gaiyr-musalamaanon yaa ‘mul nivaasiyon’ (jaisaa ki unhen kaha jaataa he) ke bich jhadpon main maare gaye

 khatarnaak yah he ki rajya main apni takat badhaane ke liye rajnatik partiyaan samudaayon ke bich pahchaan ko lekar bad rahi samvedansheeltaa kaa istemaal kar rahi hai
 The furnace of tensions has been so heated that questions like why and what have become meaningless
 natijatan, jawahiri kaa elaan isamen or ijapha hi karegaa
 The BJP is hoping to win the 2016 assembly elections in Assam and for this it is riding on the communally most inflammatory issue
 masalan, bangladesh se gaiyr-kanoonee dhang se aa based musalamaanon se sthaneey logon ke astitv ko khatra he
 Bijoy Mahajan, senior spokesperson of the Assam BJP, says, "the video proves what the people of Assam have been feeling for decades
 yah assam ko islamic rajya banane kii sajeesh he or gaiyr-kanoonee musalmaan bascindia unke khel ke mohare hai
 Experts believe that this attitude of BJP is not unreasonable
 in garmiyon main party loksabhaa kii saat siten jeet gai, jo rajya main uskaa sarvshereshth pradarshan he
 The major role in this victory is believed to be the announcement of the party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in April that the party will send back all Bangladeshi Muslims after coming to power
 yahi nahin, isi maheene hue upachunaavon main jahaan desh ke duusare hisson main dhruvikaran kaa zyada asar nahin hua, jabaki assam main bijepi ne ummid se behatar pradarshan kiya
 He wrested the Silchar seat from the Congress and recorded a substantial increase in his votes in the Muslim majority areas of Jamunamukh and Lakhipur
 jamunamukh main to vah duusare number par rahi jo ol india united democratic front (eiudief) ke pramukh badaruddin ajmal kaa grih kshetra he
 Political pundits say that the BJP did not have to work very hard because there has always been a tremendous undercurrent of xenophobia against Bangladeshi Muslims in the state
 guwahati uniwarsity ke associat professor nani gopal mahant kehete hai, “lakhipur or jamunamukh, donon jagah muslim vot congress or eiudief main bant gaye jabaki hindu vot bijepi ke saath ekajute khadey rahe
 Assam's non-muslims were united by the rise and success of the AIUDF, which practiced minor and straightforward politics of minorities, which were earlier divided into ethnic and linguistic quadrants
 ” yahi vajah he ki mukhyamantri tarun gogoi silchar main apni party kii saakh bachaa nahin sake
 However, in order to woo the Hindu Bengalis, he had declared Bangla language as the official language in the Barak Valley
 2011 main gogoi ne bangladesh se aae hindu apravasiyon ko sharnaarthi kaa darja dene kii ghoshnaa karke baraak ghati apni party congress kii jhuli main daal di thi, lekin 2014 main yah mudda modi ne hathiyaa liya
 Anticipating threats from Islamic aggression and the clandestine and well-planned mission of Hindu revival has transformed Assam into an ideal laboratory of politics divided into communal mines
 assam kii bhugolic sthiti kaa islamic aatanki dhadon ke liye ranneetik mahatv he kyonki isaki lagbhag khuli simaaen bangladesh ke saath milti hai
 a top officer of the special branch of the state police says, "this is not a threat to Assam; It is a question of national security
 ek baar updraviyon ne assam paar kiya to saare desh main failte unhen der nahin lagegi
 Political observers believe that Assam has turned into a fertile land for Islamic terror due to the growing Muslim population, particularly the economic backwardness of Muslims living on the plains and the resentment against alleged illegal immigrants, especially in the districts bordering Bangladesh
 is
 rajya main vidhansabha chunaav mahaj 20 maheene dur rah gaye hai, or har party apni taiyaariyon main jute gai he
 bjp's goal is to mobilize Assamese Hindu castes, other non-muslim communities and tribals against common enemy "muslim infiltrators"
 uske “mishan 84” (yani 126 sadasyon kii assam vidhansabha main teen-chauthai siten hasil karnaa) kii kaaryayojna taiyaar he jiskaa aadhaar he gaiyr-kanoonee apravasiyon kii baadh
 The BJP is also working on a strategy to woo tribal groups in the state
 iske liye centre sarkaar chah or samudaayon ko anusuchit janajati kaa darja dene kii yojana bana rahi he
 The move is expected to strengthen the bjp's base among tribes in the state and the tribal population will increase to 40 per cent
 party kii yojana kendriya khel mantri tathaa rajya ke adivasee netaa sarbanand sonoval ko agle mukhyamantri kii taur par pesh karne kii he
 bjp's election in-charge for Assam, Sudhanshu Mittal, says, "this issue touches every native of Assam as it can change the state's population structure forever
" rajya main bangladesh se aae gaiyr-kanoonee musalamaanon ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 We have to fulfill the unfinished agenda of the Assam movement
 hamaare pradhanmantri ne yah bilkul saaf kar diya he
 "(people killed in Bodo attack at Khagrabadi, about 200 km from Guwahati in May 2014)
 Unlike the attitude of the All Assam Student Union (AASU), which led the Assam Movement in the 1980s, the BJP was unabashed at Muslim infiltrators
 Is directly targeting party apane ‘lav jehad’ abhiyaan kii assam main ‘soft lonching’ kar rahi he
 However, this issue is not yet part of the speeches of the leaders
 apni pahchaan jaahir karne se parhez karne vaale assam bijepi ke ek aalaa netaa kehete hai, “yah hakeekat he
 Consider the number of women abducted in certain areas of Assam
 ” bijepi netaa rajya main hindu mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaale yon aparaadhon ke bare main bhi khatarnaak dhang se baaten karte milte hai
 This year, incidents of meat throwing in temples in Assam have also been seen on a large scale
 silchar ke narsingh mandir main gomance milane kii afvaah se tanaav paidaa ho gaya tha
 As a result of the clashes, at least 30 people were injured, including the Superintendent of Police (SP) and six policemen
 kachaar ke espi digant bora kehete hai, ‘vah niri afvaah thi jise kuch asaamaajik tatwon ne hawa di thi
 Actually nothing had happened in that temple
 ” unheen dinon ke aasapaas naugaanv jile ke dhubri or dhing se bhi isse milti-julati ghatnaon kii khabaren ain
 The Inspector General of Assam Police (IG) says, "there was no response in Dhubri as the Hindu population is very small but there was tension in Dhing
 baad main hamane kuch sthaneey ladakon ko pakadaa jinhone sharaab pikar mouj-masti karte hue kuch haddiyaan bina soche-samajhe phenk di thim
 RSS leader Uma Shankar Goswami, who lives in Hojai of the same district, does not believe in police theory
 unka daawa he ki sthaneey madrase tamaam asaamaajik tatwon or gaiyr-kanoonee hathiyaaron ke adde ban gaye hai
 More than 70 percent of Hojai's population is Muslim and is the hometown of perfume-baron-turned-badruddin Ajmal who also runs schools, madrasas and hospitals in the area
 aresas kaa sabase bada centre bhi yaheen sthit he jo purvottar main prachaarkon ke liye parikshaayen yojit karata he
 Goswami says, "it was a well-planned event and it was not the first time
" sthaneey media ab in ghatnaon kii report karne laga he
 "goswami claims that the RSS is working quietly at the grassroots level to inculcate a sense of religious identity among Hindus here
 darasal, bijepi ke “mishan 84” kii kamyaabi aresas ke jamini kaam par hi nirbhar he
 It is the RSS that has created space in the tea gardens of Assam to arouse Hindu sentiments
 bijepi ne nae sadasyon kii bhartee shuru bhi kar di he or jila mukhyalayon par unhen party ke mul siddhanton kaa prashikshan bhi diya jane laga he
 But polarization is not happening unilaterally
 9 sitambar ko jamunamukh main vidhansabha upachunaav ke liye ek raily ke dauraan barpeta se loksabhaa saansad tathaa badaruddin ajmal ke bhai sirajuddin ne elaan kiya ki eiudief pramukh assam ke agle mukhyamantri honge
 Sirajuddin's statement was inspired by the growing mass base of the Front
 eiudief kii sthapana 2005 main ajmal ne kii thi or tabhi se yah khud ko musalamaanon ke rakhwala or kherkhwaah ke taur par pesh karti he
 The AIUDF is the largest opposition party in the assembly and is expected to emerge as a kingmaker, winning at least 35 seats in 2016
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main front ne congress ke baraabar teen siten jeet leen jabaki 2009 main ek hi seat jiti thi
 Ajmal Muslims refrain from directly responding to the bjp's aggressive campaign against infiltrators
 shaayad isi vajah se muslim vot bank congress se hatakar lagaataar eiudief ke paale main ja rahaa he
 Says Ajmal, “we believe that anyone who has entered Assam after March 25, 1971, must be removed from India
 yahi taarikh gaiyr-kanoonee dhang se ghusane waalon kii pahchaan ke liye cat-of ke taur par 1985 ke assam samjhaute main tay kii gai thi
 But many organizations are creating panic among minority communities of Assam by raising the issue of illegal infiltration
 assam main bangladeshiyon kii asli ginati ek baar hameshaa ke liye tay kyon nahin kar lee jaati
 "not only this, Ajmal goes a step further and warns Al Qaeda's Zawahiri to stay away from Assam
 ve kehete hai, “ye log jehadi nahin, dehshatgard hai
 The Muslims of Assam are quite intelligent
 hamen apane bachaav ke liye al kaayda kii jarurat nahin he
 "but not all Muslims are convinced
 muslim youth forum against communalism, terarysm and cedishan naam kaa enjio chalaane vaale iares adhikari aashiq jamaa ek ghatana sunaate hai
 The incident is of a relief camp for Muslims who were homeless in the 2012 Bodoland violence
 jamaa bataate hai, “ham vahaan kapade or kitaaben baantne gaye the
 Many youngsters asked if we could give them a gun
 ye shivi islamparast aatank ke prasar ke liye sabase upjau maidan hai
 “some security officials and ngo-related people fear that violence may occur before the assembly elections
 vajah yah ki rajnatik partiyaan sarkaar ke saath yudhviram samjhaute se bandhe, rajya bhar main 22 shiviron main rah rahe ugravadiyon ko bhaade ke hatyaron ke taur par istemaal kar sakate hai
 Frustrated by the faded and ineffective functioning of Chief Minister Gogoi, the Congress has also joined the race and is fueling tensions
 roha se congress ke vidhayak piyush hajarika ne india today se kaha, “1 april ko biswanath charaili main narendra modi kii raily ke fouran baad sthaneey bijepi netaa bhavadev goswami ne ek tivi channel se kaha tha ki bijepi ko endiefabi vidrohiyon kaa samarthan mil rahaa he
 i am sure that the party will use new terrorist organizations to implement its communal agenda in the state
 ”agle 20 maheenon ke dauraan aarope-pratyarope kii yah raajnneeti tanaav or hinsa kii patariyon ke samanaantar chalaai jaaegi
 Religious insecurities can become the primary means of winning votes in communalism politics
 bhay or ashanka raajnneeti kii sarhad tak hi simit nahin he
 This is also affecting the social fabric of Assam which is already disintegrating
 sankhyabal main pichhadgaye kii ashanka ne rajya ke sabase cosmopolitan shahar guwahati main bhi sampradayik tanaav paidaa kar diya he
 IRS officer Ashik Zaman of Goalpara was refused a house on rent in Guwahati because he is a Muslim

 Their hostages, suspected to be illegal infiltrators, felt that both were gathering evidence against them
 antat unhen police ne chhudaaya
 Local people say that these are not sporadic incidents

 Religious intolerance should not take such a new form that further divides Assam's diverse society and becomes a cause of bloodshed
