 The big score was neither for making passes to India nor for making passes for UAE
 phir bhi pehle do maichon ke hero shikhar dhawan or pehle do maichon main fail rahe rohit sharma ne sadhi hui shuruyaat kii
 Together they added 29 runs till the seventh over but Shikhar could not keep the ball down in an attempt to punch Mohammad Naveed's ball on the same score
 becoward point par khadey rohan mustafa ne ek haath se hawa main uchhalte hue laajawab kaich liya, jisane dhawan kii 14 ran kii pari kaa ant kar diya
 Tees of not scoring runs in the first two matches was motivating Rohit Sharma to play better
 wo jaanate the ki saamne score bahut bada nahin he isliye unki koshish gend ko balle ke bichombich lene kii thi
 In the ninth over of the innings, Rohit took the pressure off himself by hitting three fours off Mohammad Naveed's balls
 duusare chor par khadey viraat bhi rohit kaa hausala badha rahe the
 Together, the two took India to 50 in the 10th over
 ranon kii gatibad rahi thi aurjit se faasla kamahota ja rahaa tha
 By 16 overs, India had scored 88 runs for 1 wicket
 rohit sharma apni half centuri se sirf 3 ran dur the or viraat 27 par khel rahe the
 The victory was only 15 runs away but due to the dinner break India's wait became a bit longer
 dinar se lautate hi rohit ne 17wein over main chaukaa jamaakar apni half centuri puri kar lee
 India's 100 runs were also completed in the 18th over and by scoring a four off the last ball of the 19th over, Rohit gave India a third consecutive victory in this World Cup

 Team India still remain in the top position in their pool thanks to this stunning win by 9 wickets

 The uae's decision also gave India some relief as England bowlers on the same ground washed away the strong batting line-up of the first batting team in the match of the tri-series played before the World Cup and the entire team Was reduced to 200
 yuai kii team bina kisi badlaav ke maidan par utari lekin team india ghutane ke dard se jujh rahe uske star gendbaaj mohammad shami ke bina maidan main utari thi
 In such a situation, this was a great platform for the return of Bhuvaneshwar Kumar
 amjad ali or andry beringer kii jodi yuai ke liye pari kii shuruyaat karne utari lekin pich par donon zyada vakt ek saath bitaa nahin paae
 In the second over of the innings, in an attempt to hook a bouncer from Umesh Yadav, Berringer put the ball on his head, which was easily caught by Dhoni and ended Berringer's 4-run innings
 duusare openar amjad ali bhi 4 ran se aage nahin bad paae
 He failed to hook up the rising ball of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who was returning from injury and the ball touched Dhoni with his globs
 5 over main sirf13 ran par 2 wicket ganvaane ke baad yuai ko ab jarurat ek aisi partnership kii thi jo team ko ek thos score kii taraf le ja sake
 Now on the pitch were Indian-origin Krishna Chandran Karate and Khurram Khan with experience of playing one-day matches against India
 lekin donon ne abhi 5 over main 15 ran hi or jode the ki aswin kii ek slor gend ko padhane main krishna chandran chook gaye
 His attempt was to defend his ball but the ball fell into the hands of Raina standing in the leg slip, touching his globs and Thai pads
 karate ne bhi 4 hi ran banaae
 Another Indian-origin batsman Swapnil Patil also got caught in Ashwin's spin
 pari ke 15wein over main aswin kii gend ko foverd dephence karne kii koshish main gend unke balle kaa kinaaraa lete hue slip main khadey shikhar dhawan tak ja pahunchi
 Dhawan caught this catch while making a great dive
 patil ke balle se sirf 7 ran nikle
 The experience of veteran Khurram Khan also knelt before Ashwin
 upar uthati gend ko sweep karne ke chakkar main gend unke balle se takaraakar dhoni ke sir ke upar se leg slip kii taraf uchhal gai jise raina ne bhagkar apane haathon main lapak liya
 Khurram scored 14 runs before being dismissed
 aswin kaa ye lagaataar teesraa wicket tha
 Reaching 44 runs in the 17th over, the UAE lost half their team
 bhartiya team kaa har gendbaaj wicket chatka rahaa tha
 Mohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja also washed their hands in this flowing Ganges
 rohan mustafa mohit kii gend ko padhane main chuke or gend ko dephence karne kii koshish main elbeadblyoo ho gaye
 Rohan also took a review against the umpire's decision but to no avail
 rohan ne 2 ran banaae
 Amjad Javed also scored two runs while defending Jadeja's ball and caught Raina standing in the slip
 yuai kii bade scoraki tamaam ummiden dharaashai ho chuki thim
 Shaiman Anwar was standing with the tail batsmen but there was not much in his hand between the wickets falling from one end
 aathven number par aae mohammad navid (6) ko aswin ne bold kiya or nauven number par aae captain mohammad tawqir(1) ko jadeja ne
 The innings was half over and the UAE was struggling to touch the 100 mark
 khayr 7 over tak shaiman anwar or manjula gurj ne apane wicket bachaae rakhe or kisi tarah 32wein over main apni team ko 100 ke paar pahunchaaya
 But in the same over, Umesh Yadav bowled Shaiman Anwar, who scored 35 runs
 isi ke saath yuai kii puri team 102 ran par simat gai
 This is the lowest score of any team in the World Cup against India

 At a press conference on Sunday, he asked that when the Gandhi family does not do any work, how do they have such wealth? How did Rahul Gandhi's wealth grow from 55 lakh to 9 crore from 2004 to 2014? Patra said that he does not understand how the wealth of this family has become so much? Whereas, Sansadi is the only means of earning this family
 unke paas doctor yaa vakil jaisaa koi kaam nahin he
 Sambit Patra has questioned the Gandhi family's land deal, form house rent and property deal
 sambit ne manahani kaa cese darj karne kii bhi chunauti di he
 Sambit Patra has claimed about Rahul's farmhouse in Mehrauli that it is about 5 acres
 iske maalik rahul or priyanka gandhi hai
 It was leased to a company named Financial Technology India Limited in 2013
 har maheene isse 7 lakh rupye kaa kiraaya aata he
 For this, 40 lakh rupees were taken in advance for the first time
 yah rakam puri tarah se byajmukt thi
 Whereas, the question arises as to how one can give money in advance without interest
 jis company ko yah kiraye par di gai he, uski sahaayak company neshnal spot exange limited ne 2013 main eneliel ghotaalaa kiya
 The farmhouse earned Rs 3 crore between 2007-08 and 2012-13
 jabaki, apane halafname main rahul ne is formahouse kii keemat 9 lakh rupye bataai he lekin isse karodon rupye kamaaye hai

 The total cost of both is seven crores but only four crores were given for its contract

 He asked whether this amount was given to earn interest or to buy property

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and Robert Vadra have made suspicious land deals
 rahul gandhi jahaan se bhi namakan karenge, us par hamaari najar rahegi
 i want to ask the Gandhi family, from where did the Gandhi family make so much wealth of crores without earning? desh ke 10wein sabase svachh shahar vadodara ne somvaar ko ek nayaa ginis vishwa record kaayam kiya he
 This record has been made by most people sweeping in one place

 The Punjab government is preparing to stop the release of 'the Accidental Prime Minister' in Punjab based on former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh

 These ministers say that the film depicts the image of the Congress party and their leader former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in a wrong way and all this has been done to cause political harm to the Congress
 punjab sarkaar ke mantri sadhu singh dharmsot ne kaha ki sidhe taur par is film se desh ke pehle sikh pradhanmantri or senior congress leader manmohan singh ko kamjor pradhanmantri bataae jane kii koshish kii gai he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi should also see that such a film should not be allowed to be released, making fun of an economist who believes in the whole world and who has ruled the country and ruled the government for 10 years
 centre sarkaar ko is film par roak lagaani chahie or sikhon kii bhavanaaen bhi is film kii vajah se aahat ho sakati hai
 They will try not to let the Punjab government release this film in Punjab
 vahiin, akali dal ke pravaktaa charanjit singh barad ne kaha ki punjab main congress kii rajya sarkaar film 'da accidental prime ministar' ko relies nahin hone dena chaahati kyonki is film main sidhe taur par dikhaaya gaya he ki kis tarah se gandhi parivaar ke dabaav main manmohan singh ne majaburi main kai faisle liye
 The Gandhi family made him the Prime Minister of the country but he was always kept under pressure
 us dauraan kii hakeekat janata ke saamne na aae isi vajah se is film par roak lagane kii punjab sarkaar taiyaari kar rahi he

 Ravi Shankar said - There is no intolerance in the countryagenda Issues ranging from inflation to intolerance arose during the discussion in the second session till date
 ashishnutaa ke mudde par ravishankar ne kaha ki yah desh jitna hinduon kaa he, utana hi musalamaanon kaa or duusare dharmon ke logon kaa bhi he
 There is no intolerance in the country

 The topic of discussion in the session was- 'stop Modi wave?' In the discussion on the issue of inflation also Ravi Shankar said that there was a difference in the yield and consumption of pulses
 beete do saal main kam barish hui, isliye keemten badhin
 On the Modi wave, Vrinda Karat said that the Bihar election itself gives the answer: Modi wave has weakened or strengthened
 akhabaaron main modiji kii tasveeron kii jagah gaay kii tasveeron ne lee
 Why Modi does not go to farmers' homes abroad Ravi Shankar was asked that PM Modi roams abroad, but in 2015 3000 farmers committed suicide, why did he not go to a single farmer's house? On this, Ravi Shankar said that Modi had already said in the first speech given to the Red Fort that this government will live for the poor, for the farmers
 19 karod jandhan khaaton main se 11 karod garibon ke hai, kisaanon ke hai
 We are working sincerely for the farmers

 The first session on the issue of development in the first session was 'express Way of Development'
 is dauraan vikaas or raajnneeti ke bich sansad main jari hangaame par bhi baat hui
 Asked if an expressway would be able to be built even within Parliament, Gadkari said that the ruling party would try to run the parliament smoothly after discussing with the opposition
 gadakari bole- dange UPA kaarykaal main bhi huevikas ke mudde se shuru hui baat siyasat par pahunch gai
 When Ashwini Kumar raised questions on the government, Gadkari said - BJP is not a mother-son party
 muslimon ke khilaaf congress kii raajnneeti rahi he
 There was no government decision against the minorities
 dange to upie ke kaarykaal main bhi hue hai
 Gadkari was asked whether the richness of the country would be judged from the roads of the country? On this, Gadkari said that if there are roads, then villages will develop
 shaharon ke saath krishi or gaanvon kaa vikaas bhi jaruri he
 On this, Ashwini Kumar said that the country is concerned about self-respect
 ashvini bole- upie kii nitiyaan hi aage badhaaeshvini ne gadakari se mukhaatib hote hue kaha ki aap vikaas ke naam par paryaavaran kii dhajjiyaan uda rahe hai

 aap upie kii yojanaon ko hi aage badha rahe hai
 State one policy that you have made
 garibon ke utthan kii yojanaon main aapane sabase zyada katautee kii
 In response, Gadkari said that it is a desperation to leave power
 party adhyaksh ke sawaal ko taal gaye garkarigarkari se jab poocha gaya ki party adhyaksh rahenge yaa chale jaaenge, to unhone kaha ki yah party tay karegi
 Asked if the RSS would decide, Gadkari deferred the matter
 maujuuda adhyaksh amit shah kaa kaarykaal disambar main khatm ho rahaa he
 Gadkari said that this is not a party like Congress, no one can question the decision of the president
 yahaan adhyaksh faisla lete hai or 10 log kah dete hai ki yah sahi nahin he
 The issue of National Herald was also raised during the discussion
 gadakari ne kaha ki nehru ne kaha tha ki yadi is par sankat aayega to main apana ghar bhi bech duungaa
 But the Congress did the opposite
 90 karod rupee trust ke jariye bina tex ke company main le liye
 Was the court's decision taken on pressure on PM Modi's phone
 yah ham par nahin, nyaaypalika par or faisla dene vaale jaj par aarope he
 Action has nothing to do with politics

 However, the bride-groom's family as well as the police have gathered to bring this marriage back on track
 ravivaar ko dahej kii maang ko lekar duulhaa shaadi ke mandap se faraar ho gaya tha
 Then the girls were taken hostage by the girls
 bihar main dahej ke khilaaf janajagran ke liye sarkaar tamaam koshishen kar rahi he, lekin dahej lobhiyon ke dilon dimag main dahej kaa daanav ab bhi baitha hua he
 The new case is of Bihata village under the Salimpur police station area in Bihar's Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's native town Bakhtiyarpur
 yahaan jab dahej kii maang puri nahin hui to duulhaa or uske parijan shaadi ke mandap se bhaag khadey hue
 The daughter of Ashok Chaudhary, a resident of Bihta village, was married with private bank employee Sunil Kumar, resident of Didarganj, Patna

 The ritual of Jayamala was also completed in front of the processions
 lekin jayamala hote hi var paksh kii ore se kathith 3 lakh rupee bataur dahej maanga jane laga
 The girl alleged that seeing the demand of Rs 3 lakh was not met, the groom left the pavilion and fled
 vahiin, duulhe ke saath baraat bhi lautne lage
 Seeing the groom and the procession from the pavilion, the girl's villagers came in a fit
 unhone band baaja party samet baraat main aae kai logon ko graminon ne bandhak bana liya
 As soon as the information of the case was received, the police of Salimpur police station also reached the spot
 police ne bandhak banaae gaye logon ko chhudaakar thane le ai
 The two sides later reconciled after talks
 ab phir se shaadi kii taiyaariyaan hone lagi hai

 Giriraj Kishore is a noted Hindi writer, novelist, storyteller, playwright and essayist
 unka janm 8 july, 1937 ko uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar main hua
 Although he has been awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for his novel 'dhai Ghar', his work on the Mahatma is bigger than any award
 kehete hai, 'dhai ghar' main giriraaj kishor ne jivan ke itane vividh rang, rekhaayen, charitra or parivesh ke swar shaamil kiye ki unase guzar kare ek naye samaaj or uski dhadkan ko bilkul nai bhangima ke saath dekha ja saktaa tha
 Giriraj Kishore, who was the director of IIT Kanpur's Center for Creative Writing and Publishing, traveled to South Africa and Mauritius for his work on the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi
 unki prakashit charchit kritiyon main upanyaas log, chidyaghar, jugalbandi, do, teesri satta, daavedaar, yatha-prastaavit, indra sunen, antardhwans, parishisht, yatraayen, dhaighar, girmitiyaa aadi shaamil hai
 Story collections include neem flowers, four pearls of no avail, paperweight, relation and other stories, city-by-city, Hum Pyaar Karne, Gaana Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Ka, Jagattarni, Valderoji, Andrey's girlfriend and other stories; Drama, malevolence, grass and horse, let the subjects remain, the crime ayad, whose face, whose face, take only my name, the cannon of wood; Includes Ekanki-collection ghulam-begum-badshah and Essay-collection katha-akath, Logic of writing, Dialogue Setu, concerns
 giriraaj kishor ko lekhan ke liye hindi santhaan uttar pradesh kaa bharatendu puraskaar, madhyapradesh sahitya parishad kaa veerasingh dev puraskaar, uttar pradesh hindi sammelan dwaara vasudev singh swarna padak, sahitya academy puraskaar, uttar pradesh hindi santhaan kaa sahitya bhushan sammaan, mahatma gandhi sammaan, vyas sammaan, janavaani sammaan, hindi seva nyaas sammaan shaamil he
 Distinguished as a Gandhi-thinker by writing 'pehla Girmitiya', senior Hindi storyteller Giriraj Kishore has tried to understand and explain Gandhi from different angles in these articles, statements and lectures
 gandhi ke jivan or virodhabhaason ko dekhen to kaha ja saktaa he ki unka vyaktitv or darshan ek satat banati hui ikai tha
 An under construction building that was in operation at every moment
 unka jivan bhi prayogshaala tha, man bhi
 Gandhi as a concept meets us as a sutra in the same way as Marx; It is up to us to understand our present and future with that formula
 yahi vajah he ki goli se maar die jane, bich-bich main unhen apraasangik siddh karne or jane kitni aitihaasik galatiyon kaa jimmedaar tehraae jane ke baavjood ve bache rahete hai; or rahenge
 They would still be after the domination of the forces that killed them
 ve koi puri likhi ja chuki dharm-pustika nahin hai, ve jeene kii ek paddati hai, jiskaa anveshan hameshaa jari rakhe jane kii maang karata he
 Today, on Giriraj Kishore's birthday, he is presenting an excerpt from the recently published book 'gandhi and Samaj' from his Rajkamal publication on literature Aaj Tak
 is pustak main shaamil sabhi aalekh pichley kuch varshon main alag-alag maukon par likhe gaye hai; isliye inke sandarbh nitant samakaleen hai; or aaj kii nigaah se gandhi ko dekhte hai
 These articles also highlight the organized propaganda against 'person Gandhi' and 'idea Gandhi'; And the mind structure of the mentor who worships his killer has also been made a matter of concern and contemplation
 pustak anshah gandhi or samaajagandhi ne ambedkar se bhi siikhaa tha- giriraaj kishorabsvin sadi main maanavadhikaar ke kshetra main do aise vyakti sakriy hue, jinhone bhartiya samaaj ko gaharaai se prabhavit kiya he
 One is Mahatma Gandhi, the other is Bhimrao Ambedkar
 maanavadhikaar do dishaao main prabhavit hota he
 One, understanding and countering one's suffering as an individual, second, understanding and resolving the suffering of society at the social level
 yah ek vishaal chunauti he
 Ambedkar had a different type of human concern
 unke saamne ek itnaa bada dalit varg tha, jisaki yatnaa ko unhone khud mahasoos kiya tha
 The suffering of that class was his own
 unki pidaa puure us varg kii thi, jo is desh kaa bahut bada ang tha
 Abolition of pain can be possible only when human beings interview it within themselves
 ambedkar ne apane sarokaaron ko samshti se joda
 This compassion of his is seen in the context of the Buddha, only then we can feel that Ambedkar had connected his inner suffering with the world by not confining himself to it
 maanav tabhi maanav banataa he, jab karunaa kaa bhav use pakhaartaa he
 This was the reason why Ambedkar was fighting for the emancipation of the Dalits, Buddha-philosophy has a big hand in breaking the Manuwadi slavery, weakening the caste-hold and increasing social mobility
 sabase badi baat he ki unka maanavadhikaar sudhaarwadi na hokar aatm mukti kaa aandolan tha, jisamen aatm-mukti kaa ehsaas us vyakti ko bhi ho sake, jo saamaajik bhedbhaav se sarvaadhik pratadit he
 Gandhiji had also done a similar struggle to free Indian indentured laborers in South Africa
 bhartiya majdoor adhiktar yaa to dalit the yaa pichde varg ke the
 That is why they had to 'declassify' themselves in a way
 rahan-sahan, khan-paan, vesh-bhusha sabko badalakar samaan str par utarkar unke sangharsh main shariq hona gandhi ke liye anivaaryta thi
 This was not necessary for Ambedkar as he had his roots in the same class
 bhale hi vah param aadhunik dhang se rahete the
 Gandhi had realized that these workers respected him very much, but hesitated to come closer to his way of life and way of living
 jab tak vah usamen parivartan nahin laayenge, tab tak unamem samanta kaa bhav paidaa karnaa sambhav nahin hoga
 Even the laborers or workers who used to stay in their house and stay in the night, they used to empty their urine vessels in the morning and wash themselves
 isi baat ko lekar kasturba or unke bich tanaav bhi ho gaya tha
 Ambedkar did not have to give proof of this equality
 unki dalit mukti kii daud gandhi ke bahut aage se shuru hui thi
 Ambedkar made Buddha's parity the basis of his life
 yah hindu varna vyavastha ke khilaaf swanubhoot pratikriya thi
 It was a reflection of his own experience
 gandhi ne armbh main jati or varna vyavastha ko avashya mana, parantu baad main apane vyavhaar main is vyavastha ko asweekaar bhi kiya ki vah aise kisi vivaah main shaamil nahin honge, jisamen var or vadhoo main ek dalit nahin hoga
 Gandhi completely changed this point under the influence of Ambedkar
 yah lacheelaapan ambedkar se adhik gandhi main dekhne ko miltaa he
 Actually, even though the Varna system was initially based on occupation as some scholars believe, later it was synonymous with genetic purity
 gandhi kaa us kaal main rakt shuddhta ke sawaal ko najrandaaj karnaa varna vyavastha ko nakaarna tha
 Many times, like Ambedkar, Martin Luther King Jr
 had a great effort to bring the neglected and disadvantaged class into the mainstream and get a respectable place for centuries
 bhale hi martin luther king gandhi ke anuyaayi the, parantu vah ambedkar kii bhanti apane upekshit varg ko samanta ke str par laane main safal rahe
 The result of the same struggle is that today the President of a colorist country like America belongs to the Black community
 yahan main rahul sankrutyaayan ke darshan-digdarshan se, buddha ke sandarbh main unki raay kaa ullekh karunga, 'buddha apane samay ke shaasha varg ke agent ke madhyasth jaise the
 He wanted to advocate for justice without removing the fundamental interest of the class
 ’ kya yah baat ambedkar par bhi lagu ho sakati he? unke dwaara yah maane jane ke baavjood ki angrejon ne dalit varg ke liye iske sivaay kuch nahin kiya ki kanoon kii najar main dalit ke saath bhedbhaav nahin hone diya (jabaki manuaadi kanoon main dalit ke prati vaimnasy purna bhinn dand vidhaan tha)
 He was a respected member of the government
 ambedkar main dalit samaaj ke prati gahan karunaa thi
 Compassion is the basis of human rights
 lekin us karunaa kaa laabh unke samast samaaj ko nahin mila
 Probably because the Savarna society or the Avarna society is always dividing
 chaar yaa paanch varnon kaa hona hi is baat kaa pramaan he ki ham kabhi ek nahin rahe
 Are victims of congenital schizophrenia
 shaayad yahi kaaran tha ki lakh prayatnon ke baavjood ambedkar dalit varg ko aapas main milakar ek samaaj nahin bana paae
 There are only one in the name of reservation, they are divided
 unamem bhi savarnon kii tarah aantarik asprishyata bani rahi
 In the last days, Ambedkar used to say that he could not do what i wanted
 shaayad uske peeche yahi bhav rahaa ho ki vah samgr dalit samaaj ko mila nahin paae
 This also seems true in the context of Gandhi
 ambedkar ke saamne apane samaaj ko aage badhaane kii chunauti thi
 Gandhi had the challenge of bringing back a society dominated by a society with a neglected society, which was even more difficult
 unhen peeche laana visham chunauti thi
 For this, he had to work tirelessly
 iskaa virodh bhi hua or pratwaad bhi
 But Gandhi accepted her dress code
 vah unki bastiyon main rahe
 They were also successful in getting a large section out of this disgusting thinking of untouchability
 in sabake baavjood ek bahut bada hissaa apane 'mind set’ se baahar nahin aa paaya
 It still exists despite the efforts of Gandhi and Ambedkar in a society of caste and colorism

 This time the Indian team which has qualified for the Incheon Asiad for the dressage or horse riding ballet competition, all four players are women
 is khel main mahila−purush yaa umr ko lekar koi bandish nahin hoti, isliye sabhi pratiyogiyon ko ek hi pratiyogita main hissaa lenaa padataa he
 The Indian dress team is hoping to win a medal in the Asiad, but before going to Incheon, they have to face so many difficulties that they are getting beaten up
 sirf 17 saal kii shubhashree rajendra inchion jane se pehle dilli main ek dost ke form par training kar rahi hai, lekin padak jeetne ke liye ise training kaa maahaul nahin kaha ja saktaa
 For the first time in this game, a team of four women players - Shubashree, Vinita Malhotra, Shruti Vohra and Nadia Haridas are formed
 isamen sabase choti shubhashree apane pradarshan se inchion asiad main itihaas kaayam karne kaa iraadaa rakh rahi hai
 Despite his young age, Shubashree is confident of his victory
 vah kahati hai, maine bahut mehnat kii he or main jaanati hum ki main acchhee hum
 
 
 Others also have experience and are good
 haal kii pratiyogitaaon main or abhyaas main maine jaisaa pradarshan kiya he, mujhe lagata he ki main medal bracket main aa sakati hum
 Colonel Jagat Singh, secretary of the Indian Equestrian Union, agrees with Shubashree
 vah kehete hai ki dakshin korian team ne pichhali dfa 65 fisadi ank hasil kiye the, jabaki bhartiya team abhyaas main 66 fisadi ank bana rahi he, isliye inase padakon kii ummid jarur he
 Shubashree's father Rajendra Sharma has been a successful athletics coach, but the daughter's expense of equestrian sports is proving to be extremely expensive for her, so she had to sell her land
 rajendra sharma kehete hai, jab shairi (shubhashree) ke coach viki thomas ne england main kaha ki is ladki main asiad main padak jeetne kaa madda he, to hamane 50 lakh rupee main smoki naam kaa ghoda kharida or iske liye mujhe apni kuch jameen bech deni padi
 Shubhashree bought a horse worth 50 lakh rupees out of the budget with the confidence of his medal and went to England from Olympian Vicky Thomas and took training for a year
 lekin asian games ke liye team ko jane ko lekar uthe sawaalon se unki saans phoolne lagi he, kyonki unka ghoda inchion pahunch chukaa he, jisaki dekhbhaal karne vaala yaa use khaanaa dena vaala koi shaks uske saath nahin he
 Shubashree and her coach are desperate to get permission to go to South Korea soon, but the officials either do not understand or they are entangled in red tape, which the players and coaches cannot solve
 17 saal kii shubhashree ke liye maidan ke baahar ke khel ko samajhnaa kisi sadame se kam nahin
 Shubashree says that i am surprised to see what is happening here
 abhi to yahi phikr he ki kisi tarah inchion janaa he
 i feel that if some private sector comes and takes up this responsibility, then only thing can be made
 bharat main ghudsawaari behad mushkil or mahangaa khel mana jaataa he
 Despite this, if a player hopes for a feat with the encouragement of his family and support staff and can also win a medal, then his spirit has to be praised
 lekin usase pehle adhikariyon ko maidan kii basic training kii jaruratein saaf najar aati he

 It is worth noting that in the last hearing, the Supreme Court had asked the Central Government to inform the Central Government in two weeks about the method for verification of those holding mobile SIM cards
 supreme court main sunwaayee ke dauraan CJI khehar ne kaha tha ki mobile sim card rakhane waalon kii pahchaan na ho to yah dhokhadhadi se rupee nikaalane ke kaam main istemaal ho saktaa he
 The government should soon process the identification, while the Center was told that in this case it needs time to file an affidavit
 iske baad supreme court ne do hafte kaa vakt diya
 In fact, the Supreme Court is hearing a public interest litigation of NGO Lokniti in which it is directed that the Central Government and TRAI should be instructed that the identity, address and all the details of mobile SIM holders are available

 Earlier, the Supreme Court had issued a notice seeking an answer in the matter

 It is now being speculated that Sabir may join the BJP

 Sabir has also flared up since being expelled from the party
 unhone kaha ki unhen muslim hone kii sajaa di gai he or agar vah kurmi ke bete hote to aisa na hota
 He claimed that Nitish Kumar had promised to send him to the Rajya Sabha, but made him a Lok Sabha candidate
 kasee tyaagi par nishaanaa sadhate hue sabir ne kaha, 'jo log yahaan mauna baba kii dallali kar rahe hai, ab wo hamen nishkasit karenge? koi kasee tyaagi kah rahe hai ki unhone mujhe party se nikaal diya he

 sabir ne kaha ki unhen kabhi modi ko kareeb se dekhne kaa mauka bhi nahin mila he, lekin ab vah tay karenge ki unhen aage kya karnaa he

 The Chief Minister of Gujarat and the Prime Minister of BJP, Narendra Modi, reached Patna late on Friday night to meet the families of those killed in the serial blasts on October 27 in Patna
 modi shuukravaar raat rajkeey atithi banakar rukenge or shanivaar ko peedit pariwaron se milane jaaenge
 Six people were killed and 83 others were injured in 6 serial blasts at Gandhi Maidan before Modi's Hunkar rally organized on October 27 in Patna
 is bich modi ke bihar daure ko lekar nitish sarkaar is baar koi khatra mol lene ko taiyaar nahin he
 At the same time, she is not deterring from the political attack
 modi kii suraksha ke liye jabardast bandobast to kiye gaye hai, lekin mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne santvanaa ke daure ko siyaasi qaraar diya he
 He alleges that BJP is trying to spoil the atmosphere of Bihar through tense politics, but it will not succeed
 modi ke patna daure or bijepi kii asthi-kalash yatra ke bare main puche jane par nitish ne kaha, 'bijepi chaahe jo marji ho, wo karti rahe
 The land of Bihar is the land of harmony
 wo sadbhaav bigaadane kii harsambhav koshish karenge
 We all know this
 pichley kuch maheenon se ham sab kuch dekh rahe hai
 Hitting out at Modi, Nitish Kumar said, "people feel that they can do politics by disturbing harmony by doing politics of tension
" waisi raajnneeti ko bihar ke logon ne pehle bhi nakaara he or wo aane vaale dinon main bhi aisa hi karenge

 After hosting 'crime Patrol' for 8 years, Anoop Soni has decided to say goodbye to the show
 philhal wo notice period sarv kar rahe hai
 Confirming the news to the Times of India, Anoop said- 'yes, i am giving up crime petrol
 8 saal bahut lanbaa samay hota he or yah jarney bahut khubasurat rahi
 Although i miss acting
 main pehle actor hum
 i have not acted for the last 5 years
 main filmein or sho karne kii soch rahaa hum
 It is stupid to commit crime by watching a crime show: It would be a little strange to watch 'crime Patrol' without Anoop Soniaup
 is bare main anup ne kaha- 'mujhe is bare main pataa he, lekin audiyans meri sthiti ko samajhegi
 a long time has passed and i do not want to do monotonous work
 main har ek episod ke liye puure pishan se kaam kiya he
 i can not be casual for hosting

 i want to experiment with my roles as an actor
 'ronit roy ne bataai tivi naa karne kii vajah, kaha- andar hi andar mar rahaa thenup ne 'balika vadhoo', 'shanti', 'kahani ghar-ghar kii' main kaam kiya he

 There is a ruckus in the party due to some outsider

 If someone's department is snatched, someone is given a new responsibility
 inamen se kuch faisle 'sarkaar' chalaane vaala apane man se letaa he or kuch idhar-udhar kii kaanaafoosee se
 But whenever it comes to this party, there is only one emperor and no one can dare to disobey it
 or jab wo 'bos' turup kaa patta chalata he to uske aage sab natmastak ho jate hai, saare vidroh dam tod dete hai or sabhi ekajute hokar ek hi sapana dekhne lagate hai

 dilli ke chunavi dangal main aarope-pratyarope kaa silsilaa joro par he
 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Bhagwant Mann fiercely targeted the bjp's CM post candidate Kiran Bedi in his own style
 bhagwant maan ne dilli ke moti nagar kii ek chunavi sabha main kaha ki kiran bedi bijepi kii 'insurance policy' hai, jeet gaye to modi or agar haar gaye to bedi
 
 
 Along with this, Mann also targeted the BJP leaders
 unhone kaha ki harshavardhan, vijay goyal jaise netaa 40 saal se siem banane kaa intjaar karte rah gaye or 40 ghante pehle shaamil huin kiran bedi ko siem ummidavaar bana diya gaya
 Mann also attacked Vinod Kumar Binny and Shazia Ilmi, who joined BJP with AAP
 unhone piem modi par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki kejariwal ko haraane ke liye piem kaa 56 inch kaa seenaa or 300 empi lagaae gaye hai
 On the other hand, another Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas targeted Kiran Bedi, alleging that Bedi was against the attack on BJP during the Lokpal movement
 vishwaas ne daawa kiya ki bedi ne kejariwal sahit ‘aap’ ke kai netaaon ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kii, jisase yah sunishchit ho sake ki bijepi shasit rajyon main ho rahaa kathith bhrashtachar saamne na aae
 The Election Commission today issued a 'show cause' notice to Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray for his alleged comments against non-marathi people and claiming that his party was denied entry after his party came to power
 Will go
 adarsh chunaav aachaar samhita kaa pehali najar main ulanghan karne ke liye notice jari karte hue chunaav ayog ne raaj ko iskaa jawaab dene ke liye 15 oktober kii subah tak kaa samay diya he
 If the reply is not received, the commission will decide without giving any new reference to Raj
 raaj ne kathith taur par kaha tha, 'jis din aap yah rajya mere haath main dete hai us din se hi maharashtra main kisi bhi udyog main srujit rojgaar sirf rajya ke marathi ladke-ladakiyon ko die jaaenge
 No employment will be provided to the people of other states
 unka pravesh bhi roak diya jayega
 Their investigation will be started from the train itself
 'ayog ne paanch oktober ko ghatkoper vidhansabha seat ke liye ek chunavi sabha main marathi main kathith taur par kahi gai raaj kii in tippaniyon ko apni notice main angreji main likhaa he
 The Election Commission has also mentioned in the notice that Raj Thackeray had allegedly said that if people from outside do not have any arrangement for living and work then they should leave
 mere rajya main na aaen
 Maharashtra has not contracted to keep people from other states
 keval hamaare ladke-ladakiyon ko yahaan rojgaar milane chahie
 Referring to another Raj's speech delivered on 7 October in the Kalna assembly seat, the Election Commission has said that the MNS chief had allegedly said that if i come to power, i will not only create massive employment but also ensure i want that all the jobs created in Maharashtra should be provided to boys and girls
 maharashtra main duusare rajya ke logon ko rojgaar band kar diya jayega
 Boards will be put on all boundaries
 jhuggiyaan ban jaati hai lekin hamaare marathi logon ko vah kifayati ghar nahin miltaa jiske vah hakdaar hai
 He had said that people from other states come and take one crore rupees from each hut in which they are occupied but the local people live in Chal and that too on rent
 ayog ke mutabik, 'raaj ne kathith taur par kaha tha ve log nijee suraksha guard ke taur par dabl bairal gan le kar maharashtra aate hai 
 Where did you get this, are you a dacoit? But people come from other states and they get a job as a security guard
 or hamaari police main bhartee ke liye maharashtra se hamaare ladke aate hai tathaa paanch kimi daudte samay in marathi ladakon kii dil kaa daura padane se maut ho jaati he
 Give the state in my hands, i will close all the private security agencies and start the Maharashtra security agency and give you employment in them
 ek adhivaktaa vinod tiwari ne sthaneey police praadhikariyon ke samaksh shikaayat kii jiske baad chunaav ayog ne thakare kii tippaniyon par sangyaan liya
 The complaint was forwarded by Shrikant Bhartiya of bjp's local unit
 ayog ne thakare ko yaad dilaayaa ki adarsh aachaar samhita ke praavdhaanon main kaha gaya he ki koi bhi party yaa pratyaashee aisi kisi gatividhi main lipt nahin rahegaa jisase matbhed upje yaa paraspar ghrinaa faile yaa vibhinn jatiyon, samudaayon, dharmon ke yaa bhashaa ke logon ke bich tanaav ho
 It also states that Section 125 of the Representation of the People Act calls electoral crime to spread disharmony on religious, racial, caste, community or linguistic basis in relation to elections among citizens of different classes
 piem narendra modi ne ieenes ke saath khaas baatcheet main prakruti ke prati apane prem, dharashayi hoti congress party or sabase mahatvapurn pakistan ke purv shubhachintakon or uske aarthik madadgaaron kii gherebandi karne kii apni vyavasthit ranneeti ke bare main baat kii
 This is something that the Prime Minister does not get enough credit for, while perhaps this is the only achievement of foreign policy
 pradhanmantri ne is dauraan satta main apni duusari pari kii bhi baat kii, jisamen vah pehle se bhi kahin adhik majboot janaadhar ke saath laute hai
 Excerpts from his conversation are as follows: You are seen in 'man vs Wild'
 bataur ek rajaneta is behad aparamparaagat sho main aane kaa kya kaaran rahaa?kai baar kisi paramparaagat mudde ko ujagar karne ke liye kuch aparamparaagat karnaa acha hota he
 i think it is right all the time to talk and work for the right purpose
 har samudaay, har rajya, har desh, har kshetra ke liye koi na koi pramukh mudda hota he
 But i believe that the issue of environmental protection is much bigger than all the issues of a particular group
 yah aaj hamaari dharti ke har insaan, har vanaspati or har pashu ko prabhavit kar rahaa he
 It is man's test that how soon and how effectively we rise above our selfishness and think about the good of the whole world
 bharat kii prakruti ke saath sadbhavnapurv tareeke se rahane kii mahaan parampara rahi he
 Various aspects of nature are considered sacred throughout the country, in states and in different cultures
 yah parampara swat: hi iske sangrakshan main madad karti he
 In a way, it is a natural conservation system in our country
 hamaari parvarish hi aisi he ki hamen prakruti ke saath miljul kar rahane kii sikh mili hui he
 We only need to remember these ideals
 mujhe lagata he ki ham isamen safal bhi hue hai, kyonki haal hi main jari hue aankade dikhaate hai ki baaghon kii sankhya main prabhaavshaalee rup se vruddhi hui he
 This program was a medium to showcase the beautiful and rich flora and fauna of India to the world
 bharat main prakruti premiyon ke liye asankhya sthaan hai, aise tamaam sthaan hai, jo vibhinn prakaar kii vanaspatiyon, vibhinn prakaar ke vanyajeevon se samrudh hai
 The number of tourists visiting the country has increased by about 50 percent in the last five years
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki buniyadi dhaanche, connactivity or suraksha ko majboot karne ke liye banaai gayi vibhinn yojanaon ke saath ham atuly bharat kii sundarataa kaa anubhav karne ke liye duniyabar se or bhi zyada paryatakon ko aate dekhenge
 How do you see the developments in the Congress party, where Sonia Gandhi became the president after Rahul Gandhi said that he did not want any Gandhi to get the post of president? What happened in the Congress is an internal matter of his family
 main is par koi tippanee nahin karnaa chahta
 In 2014, it was believed that you would not be able to establish friendly relations with the Gulf countries, but we have seen that since 2014 India's relations with the Gulf countries are improving
 vartmaan main yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki khadi deshon ke saath bharat ke rishte pichley saat dashakon main sabase achche hai
 How do you explain it? i think it has two aspects
 pehla, logon kaa ek khaas varg maanata tha ki meri sarkaar or vyaktigat rup se main na keval khadi kshetra main, balki vyapak sandarbh main bhi videsh niti ke morche par vifal ho jaaoongaa
 Whereas the truth is that my government's successful track record in foreign policy is in front of everyone in the world
 balki, 2014 main pradhanmantri pad sanbhaalane ke baad meri sarkaar ne kisi pehle videsh mantri ke aadhikarik daure kaa swaagat kiya tha, to vah the oman ke sultan
 So people should introspect on what they thought of me and what actually happened
 iske bajaay main duusare pahalu par dhyaan dena chahta hum, jo he -bharat ke liye khadi kshetra kaa mahatv
 The region has a deep cultural and historical connection with India
 yahaan 90 lakh bhartiya rahete hai, jinke dwaara bheje jane vaale dhan kaa hamaari arthvyavastha main abhootpurv yogadan he or unhone kshetra kii samruddhi main bhi apaar yogadan diya he
 i have noticed that leaders of Gulf countries attach great importance to the presence of Indian migrants and care for them as parents
 yah kshetra hamaari urja suraksha sunishchit karne main bhi hamaara pramukh sahyogi he
 Our relationship now extends to them more than buyer-seller
 yuai ne hamaare ranneetik petroleum rigerv kaarykram main hissaa liya he or yuai or saudi arab donon bharat main vishwa ke sabase bade rifinary project main nivesh karne vaale hai
 Indian companies have acquired rights in offshore oil fields in the region for the first time
 maine kshetra main sabhi deshon ke saath apane sambandh majboot karne ke liye hamaari videsh niti par dhyaan dene ke vishesh prayaas kiye hai
 Our reach in the field from the official level to the political level is unmatched
 maine khud kai baar kshetra kaa daura kiya he, or hamane bharat main kshetra ke kai netaaon kii mejabani kii he
 Talking about the leaders with whom i have the most intimate and warm talks, there are many leaders from the Gulf region
 ham niyamit rup se sampark main rahete hai
 And i think it is because of this intimacy and regular contact that our policy has been largely successful
 hamane kisi galatfahami yaa kisi andeh ko hamaare rishte ke bich nahin aane diya
 We have been very open with all countries and they have also established warm and friendly relations with us in return
 i firmly believe that India and the Gulf countries have begun to realize the true potential of a partnership that exceeds mutual benefit and can bring peace, development and prosperity not only to our shared and vast neighboring region, but to the world
 is
 2019 ke chunaav ke dauraan, kaaphi logon ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi ki aapako bahumat hasil nahin hoga
 Many had said that the 2014 result was beyond expectation and unexpected
 jab aap chunaav prachaar kar rahe the, aapkaa man kya kah rahaa tha or aap jeet ko lekar kitna aashwast the?kuch aise log hai, jo apane purvaagrah, vichaardhaara yaa kisi prakaar kii patibaddhtaon ke kaaran un logon kii haar ko lekar tark garh lete hai, jinhen ve pasand nahin karte
 There comes a time when the truth appears on the ground, but these people like to sidestep that truth
 ve logon ke man main bhram paidaa karne ke liye jhooth or farji aankadon kaa sahaara lete hai
 These are the same people who concoct such things that BJP will not get majority, BJP will form government, but it needs a new leader, BJP needs new alliances, etc
 etc
 ye log unhen bhi badnaam karte hai, jo inaki baat kaa samarthan nahin karte
 Such people have been repeatedly exposed, but there was no change in their behavior
 hamaare desh main in logon dwaara kiye jane vaale chunavi vishleshanon main partiyon, sambhavit gathjodon, dashakon puraani chemistry par aadhaarit pariwaron ke glamer ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he
 But people and their aspirations are ignored
 2014 main or 2019 main bhi jin logon ne janata se baat kii or unki praathamiktaaon ko janaa, ve jaanate the ki kya ho rahaa he
 As far as we are concerned, we do not work to win elections, we work to win the trust of the people
 sarkari dhan se zyada janata ke man kii takat hoti he
 We pay attention to the welfare of the people, election results are the result of this
 pichley 20 saalon se, main kai chunaav abhiyaanon main sakriy rup se shaamil rahaa hum or inamen se aisa ek bhi chunaav nahin tha, jab meri haar kii bhavishyavaanee nahin kii gai
 There are many people who predict the apocalypse and i wish them all the best
 vishesh rup se 2019 kii baat karun to main aapako bataa saktaa hum ki main chunaav main hamaari sambhaavnaaon ko lekar kaaphi aashwast tha
 This belief stems from our government's track record, and the way we worked on the agenda of good governance and development
 main jahaan kahin bhi gaya, maine bhaajapa or rajg ke liye bharpoor sahyog dekha
 People had decided that corruption, nepotism and dynastic politics are not acceptable in the 21st century
 ham vikaas or pradarshan kii raajnneeti ke yug main rahete hai, bayaanbaji or pratikwaad ke puraane daur main nahin?aapako iskaa ek udhaaharan detaa hum -congress party ne nyaay yojana ke bare main baat kii
 It was probably the biggest election promise, but people brushed aside such hollow promises
 unhen congress main aise vaade ko nibhaane kii eemaandaaree or kshamta nahin najar ai
 Hence, it is no surprise that those who had promised Rs 72,000 could not win even 72 seats

 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh said on Thursday that force will have to be used against Naxalites but at the same time if there is an initiative by the Center to talk to them, they will not oppose it
 singh ne kaha ki naksalwad kii samasya vibhinn rajya jhel rahe hai isliye isse rashtriya samasya ke rup main nipta janaa chahie kyonki naksaliyon kaa antim lakshya bandook ke bal par dilli par kabja karnaa he
 He said, 'whatever the Naxalites are doing in Chhattisgarh and other states, it is only a preparation for their long term goal (occupying Delhi)
 haalanki ham unase lard rahe hai lekin antat: puure desh ko unke khilaaf khada hona padega
 Singh said in a discussion on Naxal violence organized by the Integrated National Security Forum here that there should be no politics on this issue and all of us should fight the Naxalites above party spirit
 isse pehle kendriya grih mantri pi chidambaram se mulaakaat ke baad mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki koi bhi naksaliyon se baatcheet karne se peeche nahin hat rahaa he
 He was questioned on the remarks of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi that there should be talk with Maoists
 unhone kaha ki hamane yahaan tak ghoshnaa kii he ki ham behatar aatmasamarpan niti pradaan karenge
 We have also said that the Chhattisgarh government will not back down if there is an initiative to negotiate, but the main issue is that if you are inviting anyone for talks, then they should have confidence in democracy
 ‘haath main bandook lekar baatcheet nahin kii ja sakati’
 Raman Singh said that if peace is initiated then no state including Chhattisgarh will back down from this and no one hesitates to keep the path of dialogue always open
 unhone kaha, ‘narendra modi or meri soch main koi fark nahin he
 We are in favor of strict action but if there is an initiative of dialogue at the national level or at any other level, i personally or the Chhattisgarh government will not back down
 singh ne kaha, ‘chhattisgarh sarkaar or kendra sarkaar ke bich koi matbhed nahin he
 There is also no difference between the Central forces and the State forces and there is no difference between me and Chidambaram in terms of handling the Maoists'
 unhone kaha ki sabhi sambhddha log naksal samasya kaa samaadhaan chaahate hai kyonki yah samasya loktantr ke liye chunauti bani hui or shanti tathaa vikaas kii prakriya sthapit honi chahie, jiske liye har koi kaam kar rahaa he
 Raman Singh said, 'states have their boundaries and the Central Government also has its limits
 maine grih mantri ke saath sabhi muddon par or unke samaadhaan ke bare main charchaa kii he’
 Describing his meeting with Chidambaram as good, the Chief Minister said that there has been a detailed discussion about the incidents in Chhattisgarh during the last one month
 unhone kaha ki rajya or kendra sarkaar tathaa rajya police or kendriya ardhsainik balon ke bich acha sahyog or samanvay he
 We have also discussed the joint action that has been conducted during the last two years
 raman singh ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar ne jo mudde uthaaye the, un par baatcheet kii gayi he
 The position of central forces and central assistance for future plans were also discussed
 yah poochne par ki kya unhone kendra se atirikt balon kii maang kii he, mukhyamantri ne kaha ki chhattisgarh jaise rajya ke liye hamen hameshaa se hi adhik balon kii apeksha rahati he lekin kendra sarkaar uplabdhta or rajya kii aavashyaktaa ke aadhaar par bal muhaiyaa karaati he
 It is good if there is some arrangement about additional force
 chidambaram ne bhi kaha he ki yadi sambhav hoga to adhik bal muhaiyaa karaaye jaaenge
 Singh said, 'this coordination will improve in the future and there is no misunderstanding between us
 chaahe kada yaa naram rukh apnaane kii baat ho, ye sabhi chijen ek saath chal rahi hai
 There is no ideological difference with the Center '
 paricharchaa main unhone kaha ki jab chhattisgarh main sattar ke dashak ke dauraan naksalwad panpa to adivaasiyon ne shuruuaat main unka krantikari ke rup main swaagat kiya lekin jald hi unhen ahsaas ho gaya ki naksali unka shoshan kar rahe hai
 Gradually, with the formation of Salwa Judum in the tribals, the movement against the Naxalites arose
 raman singh ne kaha ki keval tir kaman se adivasee naksaliyon kaa muqabla kar rahe hai, jinke paas eke-47 riflein or visphotak hai
 They want the Naxalites to leave Chhattisgarh
 unhone kaha ki salwa judum kii kaaphi aalochana hui lekin koi bhi raajnneetik dal is tarah kaa andolan nahin kar saktaa
 The Chief Minister said that the rise of Naxal violence was due to encouraging multinational companies to exploit mineral wealth in the state, widening the gap between poor and rich and lack of development
 unhone kaha, ‘sabase pehle main bataanaa chaahunga ki ham chhattisgarh main nijee kaarobaar kii anumati nahin dete
 Only government agencies like National Mineral Development Corporation, Chhattisgarh Mineral Development Corporation and SAIL are engaged in mining of mineral wealth in the state
 singh ne daawa kiya ki naksal hinsa ke baavjood unki sarkaar vikaas se judy pariyojnaon main shaamil rahi he
 Development projects in Bastar and Surguja, particularly those affected by the Naxal problem, were run
 naksaliyon ke haathon hatyaon ke baavjood sadakon kaa nirmaan hua
 Social sector schemes are progressing well and food security has also been provided
 naksaliyon ke khilaaf hawaii hamale ke vikalp ke bare main sawaal karne par singh ne kaha ki is sachai se koi inkaar nahin karegaa ki is tarah kii chijen sahaayak tantra kii tarah hai
 But in places like Chhattisgarh, where landmines and ieds are spread everywhere, if the casualties are caused by the explosion, helicopters can be taken to the injured to reach the hospital so that they can get medical help on time
 supreme court (supreme Court) main centre sarkaar ne kaha ki rafel deal (rafale Deal) se jude kagajaat chori ho gaye hai or yachikakarta unka istemaal karke aadhikarik gopneeyata kanoon kaa ulanghan kar rahe hai

 The award was given to empower the common people by advancing the Right to Information movement
 beurocret hone ke naate mere liye yah ghoshnaa isliye vishesh aakarshan liye hue thi, kyonki isko paane vaala swayan ek naukarshah tha

 Five years later, such a round came again
 darasal, lokapal kii maang vaale san 2011 ke andolan ne bahut jaldi bhrashtachar virdohi andolan kaa rup le liya
 The parallel star that shone with Anna Hazare at that time was Arvind Kejriwal
 arvind kejariwal yani ki eemaandaaree ke sarathi, yuvaaon ke ikon, bhavishya kii sambhaavna tathaa bharat kaa bhavishya aadi-aadi
 What was the result? He became the Chief Minister, and that too the capital of the country, Delhi
 adbhut, avishwasaneey
 Again a strong attraction
 laga ki aap party par khud ko qurbaan kar duun
 Stopped himself “ruko or suno” kii niti apanaai
 But after reading his book "swarajya" it seemed that he does not think more than politics of mohallas
 sattashin hone ke baad unhone bauni or ochhi raajnneeti ke ek-do nahin, balki rozaana hi koi-na-koi pramaan diya he
 In 1974, under the leadership of Jayaprakash Narayan, he woke up and slept again and woke up in 2011 after thirty-seven years
 aaj vah khud ko chalaa hua mahasoos kar rahaa he, kejariwal ke haathon chalaa hua
 But does Arvind even realize this at all? Does this engineer have the sensitivity to know what the group's dream murderer says? Can there be any greater and heinous sin than committing future feticide? Future generations will seek answers to these questions from their history and Kejriwal will have to answer them
 yahaan iviem mashin kii aad kaam nahin aegi, kyonki itihaas atyant tatasth hota he, or nirmam bhi
 The comments kejariwal jab ganatantr diwas parade kii baadha banakar dharne par baithe the, tab media or buddhijivi varg ne unhen “ek araajaktaavaadi” kaha tha
 But at that time, the country had rejected the views of those intellectuals as biased and spiteful
 baad main ve hawa main haath laharaakar chutki bajaate or unki ungaliyon ke bich kisi na kisi bade netaa ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke sabooti dastavej aa jate

 and today? Even a foolish person is compelled to think that the lion that roars almost daily by talking about it, even without talking, is silent today
 No outsider is making allegations
 lagane vaala unhi ke mantriparishad kaa unka ek vishwasaneey saathi he
 So will silence be the answer to those allegations? The country's Finance Minister has filed a defamation suit against him
 yah vikalp kejariwal ke paas bhi he
 Will they also do the same with Kapil Mishra and present proof of their innocence to the public? beurocret hone ke naate mere liye yah ghoshnaa isliye vishesh aakarshan liye hue thi, kyonki isko paane vaala swayan ek naukarshah tha

 But after reading his book "swarajya" it seemed that he does not think more than politics of mohallas
 sattashin hone ke baad unhone bauni or ochhi raajnneeti ke ek-do nahin, balki rozaana hi koi-na-koi pramaan diya he
 In 1974, under the leadership of Jayaprakash Narayan, he woke up and slept again and woke up in 2011 after thirty-seven years
 aaj vah khud ko chalaa hua mahasoos kar rahaa he, kejariwal ke haathon chalaa hua
 But does Arvind even realize this at all? Does this engineer have the sensitivity to know what the group's dream murderer says? Can there be any greater and heinous sin than committing future feticide? Future generations will seek answers to these questions from their history and Kejriwal will have to answer them
 yahaan iviem mashin kii aad kaam nahin aegi, kyonki itihaas atyant tatasth hota he, or nirmam bhi
 The comments kejariwal jab ganatantr diwas parade kii baadha banakar dharne par baithe the, tab media or buddhijivi varg ne unhen “ek araajaktaavaadi” kaha tha
 But at that time, the country had rejected the views of those intellectuals as biased and spiteful
 baad main ve hawa main haath laharaakar chutki bajaate or unki ungaliyon ke bich kisi na kisi bade netaa ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke sabooti dastavej aa jate
 People not only listened attentively to the allegations made by them, but also believed them
 iske kaaran dilli ke is yuva mukhyamantri kii chhavi karpshan ke khilaaf jehad chhedane vaale ek atyant nidar krantikari kii hoti chali gai
 and today? Even a foolish person is compelled to think that the lion that roars almost daily by talking about it, even without talking, is silent today
 No outsider is making allegations
 lagane vaala unhi ke mantriparishad kaa unka ek vishwasaneey saathi he
 So will silence be the answer to those allegations? The country's Finance Minister has filed a defamation suit against him
 yah vikalp kejariwal ke paas bhi he
 Will they also do the same with Kapil Mishra and present proof of their innocence to the public? phir se kuch aisa hi ek daur aayaa paanch saal baad
 Actually, the 2011 movement demanding Lokpal took the form of anti-corruption movement very quickly
 us samay anna hajaare ke saath chamakane vaala jo samanaantar sitara tha, vah tha- arvind kejariwal
 Arvind Kejriwal means the charioteer of honesty, the icons of youth, the possibility of the future and the future of India, etc
 iskaa nateeja kya niklaa? ve mukhyamantri bane, or vah bhi desh kii rajdhani dilli ke
 Wonderful, incredible
 phir se ek prabal aakarshan
 i felt that i sacrificed myself on the party
 khud ko roka
 Adopted a "wait and listen" policy
 lekin unki pustak “swarajya“ ko padhane ke baad lag gaya tha ki ve mohallon kii raajnneeti se adhik kii soch nahin rakhte
 After being in power, he has given some proof every day, not one or two, of dwarf and petty politics
 san 1974 main jaiprakash narayan ke netritv main jagakar phir se soya hua yuva san 2011 main santis saal baad jaagaa tha
 Today he feels betrayed by himself, cheated by Kejriwal
 lekin kya arvind ko is baat kaa tanik bhi ehsaas he? kya is ejeeniyar ke paas vah samvedansheeltaa he, jo yah jaan sake ki samooh ke sapanom kii hatya karne vaale ko kya kehete hai? bhavishya kii bhrun-hatya karne se bhi bada or jaghanya paap kya koi anya ho saktaa he? bhavishya kii peediyaan apane itihaas se in prashnon ke uttar maangengi or kejariwal ko inke uttar dene hi honge
 The cover of EVM machine will not work here, because history is very neutral, and also ruthless
 tippaniyan When Kejriwal sat on a dharna as an obstacle to the Republic Day parade, the media and intellectuals called him "an anarchist"
 lekin desh ne us samay un buddhijiviyon kii baat ko pakshpaat evam dweshpurn maanakar nakaar diya tha
 Later, he would wave his hand in the air with a pinch and between his fingers, there would be relevant documents of corruption against some big leader
 log unke dwaara lagaae jane vaale aaropon ko na keval dhyaan se sunate, balki un par vishwas bhi karte the
 Due to this, the image of this young Chief Minister of Delhi became a very fearless revolutionary who waged a jihad against corruption

 mjedaar batahe ki chhathi vidhansabha ke gathan ke dhai saal baad is cameti ne apni pehali report sadan menrkhi he,or wo bhi yachika daayar hone ke mahaj maheene bhar ke bheetar
 The committee, headed by MLA from Greater Kailash Saurabh Bhardwaj, has 8 members besides him, none of whom are members of the opposition
 darasal yachika samiti kii is report kii kahani is saal 29 may ko shuru hoti he
 The petition of Neeraj Kumar, a resident of Pandav Nagar, alleging that the PWD and MCD had taken a poor job in cleaning the drains, was sent by the Speaker to the committee for investigation
 samiti kii sunwaayee 1 june ko shuru bhi ho gai,rochak pahalu ye he ki is sunwaayee se kuch dinon pehle hi yani 25 may ko dilli ke mukhyamantri ne ek circular nikaal kar peedblyoody vibhaag,emsidi or baaki agenciyon ke kaam kaaj main kami ke liye jimmedaari sidhe peedblyoody ke mukhya sachiv ko de di thi
 The committee also held 4 meetings between 1 June and 22 June, as well as a three-day field visit
 cameti nejokuch payapedibludy ke pramukh sachiv kii report galat tathyon par aadhaarit or juthi he
 Cleanliness was also not found in the drains cleaned
 emsidi kii report ko bhi cameti ne galat paaya
 The Committee found the House's contempt of the House for presenting an incorrect report
 samiti ne kaha ki teen dinon main do din hi peedblyoody ke pramukh sachiv unke saath field visit par gaye,jis par cameti nenaraazgi jataai
 The committee also found that the PWD secretary was not enthusiastic about the whatsapp number, Kollekar for cleaning, because he felt that doing so would bring many more types of information
 cameti nepaya ke daavon ke baavjood peedblyoody monsoon ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 The committee also found that the department did not work despite the court, LG, CM and the minister saying
 cameti ne vibhaag ke pradhan sachiv ashvini kumaar ko vibhaag kaa netritv sahi tareeke se nahin karne kaa doshi paaya
 The committee gave these suggestions to the Chief Secretary to ensure that the orders given by the Chief Minister on May 26 should be followed
 mukhya sachiv galat report ke maamle main khud jaanch karen
 Ensure modern arrangements for the cleanliness of the chief secretaries
 mukhya sachiv un thekon kii jaanch karen jo naalon kii safai ke liye die gaye
 The Chief Secretary should fix the responsibility of the officials who gave the wrong report
 chunki peedblyoody or visilence vibhaag ke sachiv ashvini kumaar hi hai,isliye jaanch puraa hone tak unhen in donon padon se hataaya jaae,taaki jaanch nishpaksh ho
 Within a month, the Chief Secretary should submit the investigation report to the Vidhan Sabha

 5 stardiarectorbhushan patelkalakaarbipasha basu aurakaran singh groverhorer film ek aisa johnor he, jisamen pichley kuch varshon main bollywood main kai prayog ho rahe hai
 In this, sex is also being served fiercely and the directors have used many types of high-tech from 3D
 lekin shaayad kahani ke maamle main ham aaj bhi jahaan the vahiin hai
 Alon is inspired by a Thai film of the same name, but director Bhushan Patel has delivered it from somewhere in the circle of making many diversions and making haorax
 bipashako vaise bhi bollywood main horer queen kaha jaataa he, aise main unhone apane is khitaab ke anuroop hi kaam kiya he
 He has a lot of experience of giving expressions of fear, but our directors who make horror films have to be a bit mature
 kahani main kitna damado bahanen hai jo aapas main judi hui hai
 The two always talk about being connected like this
 lekin ek ladkaa aata he or unki jindagi badal jaati he
 They fall in love with him
 ek bahan isse khafa ho jaati he or alag hone ke liye kahati he
 The doctors separate the two, and an accident occurs at the same time
 phir ek bahan kii jindagi ko duusari bahan dubhar kar detii he
 Then begins the Bipasha Basu style screams, which include a variety of scare-mongers
 bhootpurana bhi aati he, or bhoot bhagane ke kai tareeke aate hai
 Who also laugh
 hero heroin ko sukun dene ke liye kai tarah ke garmagarm jatan karata he
 This breaks the flow of the story a bit
 dar or sex ke chakkar main dimag ulajh jaataa he
 Star Appalibipasha has become a big name in the world of horror and the sex appeal is amazing in them
 lekin ab bipasha ko kisi or johnor main thodi filmein karne ke baad agalihorer filmamen aana chahie kyonki unke dar se jude expressant dekhne ke ham aadi ho chuke hai
 Where he has tried his best to show his acting, more than that he has tried to show his toned body, just like his fitness DVD
 aisa hi, karan singh bhi karte dikhte hai
 If he has also made body and abs then he is there to show
 isko ve bakhubi dikhaate bhi hai
 Of course the film does not frighten or intimidate, do not arouse or awaken emotions, but it definitely inspires you to create a perfect body
 bich-bich main acting to chalati hi rahati he
 Earn Ki Baat Bhushan Patel is the same director who made a hit horax film like 'ragini MMS-2' with Sunny Leone and before that he has also made '1920: Evil Returns'
 aise main unhone apane experions kaa bharpoor istemaal kiya or horex johnor premiyon ko khinchne kii koshish kii he
 The songs of the film are fine and also have a touch of hotness
 lekin bhushan ko kahani or tarkon ko thodaa solid rakhana tha
 Perhaps they should not take the story lightly when they make their inspiration to Hollywood and pick up the scene from there

 In Bundi city of Rajasthan, the government has shown strictness on the Panch Patels, who boycotted the daughters for inflicting the father's bier
 aadesh sunaane vaale sabhi panch patel muhalla chhodkar bhaag gaye hai
 The khap panchayat had decreed a family steeped in mourning in Bundi that it would not have any relation with the family in the society
 panchayat is baat se khafa thi ki betiyon ne kyon apane kandhon par pita kaa shav uthaaya
 After this, the panchayats in the panchayat had laid down that the four daughters, including the deceased's wife, folded their hands and apologized to the society in the panchayat, then the people would attend the funeral
 betiyon ne farmaan ko thokar markar pita kii ichha ke anuroop akele hi bina samaaj ke logon ke pita kaa antim sanskaar kar diya
 In fact, the panchayat in Reger Mohalla of Bundi became angry about why the daughters had blamed the father's father
 panchayat kaa kahana tha ki betiyaan shmashaan nahin ja sakati hai
 Only the sons can give mouth, if there are no sons, then in the relative, only men will give information
 varanasi: virodh ke baad bhi beti-bahu ne maa kii arthi ko diya kandhabata den ki ravivaar kii raat ko peshey se teacher rahe durga shankar kii maut ho gai thi
 During this time, four daughters who reached the spot gave shoulder to Durgashankar, then the Raigar Samaj called Panch Patel Panchayat and issued a decree that his mother including these daughters would come and apologize with folded hands and then he would attend the funeral
 magar is dauraan parijanon sahit betiyon ne khap panchayat ke farmaan kii ek na suni
 Daughters, rejecting the decree, carried the father's bier on their shoulders for the funeral
 isse khafa panchon ne parivaar ko samaaj se bedakhal kar diya
 When the matter reached the police-administration, Panch Patel left the locality and fled

 hajaaron karod rupye ke pienbi bank ghotaale ke mukhya aropiyon main shaamil mehul chokasee ke pratyrpan ko lekar bharat behad sakht ravaiya apana rahaa he, or ab uske jald hi shikanje main kase jane kii sambhaavna he
 After the bank scam surfaced at the beginning of the year, Choksi, who was absconding, acquired citizenship of the Caribbean country of Antigua and Barbuda to avoid coming to India
 lekin ab bharat sarkaar ne antigua ke saath pratyrpan ke anya vikalpon kii talash shuru kar diya he
 India does not have an extradition treaty with Antigua
 bharat ne notiphoi kiya he ki donon desh rashtramandal deshon ke tahat kiye gaye samjhaute ke tahat aate hai
 After the news of Mehul Choksi being present in Antigua and gaining citizenship there, the Indian investigative agencies are trying to reach out to him and were looking for all possible options to bring him under control
 bank ghotaale ke mukhya aropiyon neerav modi or mehul chokasee ke videsh bhaag jane or unki talash karne main naakaam rahane se bhartiya sarkaar kii lagaataar kirakiri ho rahi he
 Earlier, the government of Antigua and Barbuda suggested that under Section 7 of the 1993 Extradition Act, there was scope to send fugitive diamond trader Mehul Choksi back to India as requested by New Delhi
 ek angreji akhbaar ne apni report main daawa kiya tha kientiguaur barbuda sarkaar kii taraf se yah jaankaree vahaan ke videsh mantri ipichet green or solicytor general martin kamako ne mulaakaat ke dauraan bhartiya rajdoot ko di
 On the other hand, the CBI had already started the process of extradition of Chokasi, a diamond businessman from Antigua
 sibiai ne nivedan sanyukt raashtra sangh ke bhrashtachar viruddh sammelan (UNCAC) ke niyamon ke tahat kii jiske prati donon hi desh baadhya hai
 India has to take this route because there is no agreement on extradition between Antigua and India
 haalanki donon desh sanyukt raashtra sangh ke bhrashtachar viruddh sammelan (UNCAC) ke tahat aate hai
 During the G20 conference in Seoul, India signed and agreed to the UNCAC treaty and Antigua has also signed it
 iske tahat UNCAC par hastakshar karne vaale deshon ko sanyukt raashtra kii sandhi ko maananaa hoga or use apane yahaan lagu karnaa hoga
 Controversy over Mehul Choksi granting citizenship was clarified by Antigua and Barbuda and stated that he had sought information about Choksi from Indian agencies and passport office in 2017 before granting citizenship
 jiske jawaab main bhartiya agenciyon ne chokasee ko lekar kisi prakaar kii aapatti darj nahin karai thi
 Then India made it clear to Antigua that there is no allegation of any kind of scam or fraud against Choksi
 iske baad antigua ne chokasee ko apane desh kii naagarikta pradaan kii thi

 Bikram Majithia, brother of former Punjab Revenue Minister and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, is the first politician from whom Arvind Kejriwal started apologizing
 somvaar ko kejariwal ne kapil sibbal or kendriya sadak parivahan mantri nitin gadakari se bhi maafee maang lee
 Bikram Majithia's sister Harsimrat Kaur Badal has questioned her younger brother Bikram Majithia over Kejriwal's comfidation
 unhone kaha he ki majithia ko itani jaldi arvind kejariwal ko maafee nahin deni chahie thi
 Harsimrat Kaur Badal has expressed hope that Arun Jaitley is the only politician who is yet to apologize to Kejriwal and he will certainly teach Arvind Kejriwal a lesson
 harsimrat cor badal ke sawaal par majithia ne 'ajtak' se khaas mulaakaat ke dauraan kaha ki unki bahan or kendriya mantri apni jagah par sahi hai kyonki kejariwal ke jhuthe aaropon se unka sara parivaar behad dukhi tha
 He told how the 80-year-old's mother had tears in her eyes when she showed Kejriwal's written apology to the mother
 kejariwal ban gaye maafee minmajithia ne kaha ki unase maafee kii shuruyaat karne ke baad kejariwal ab un sabhi netaaon se maafee maang rahe hai jinhone unke khilaaf manahani ke mukademe daayar kiye hai

 On the other hand, taking a dig at Kejriwal's statement, Majithia said that he has become an apology man from Muffler Man by repeatedly apologizing
 majithia se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya vah kejariwal ko maaf karne ke baad koi pachhtaawaa mahasoos kar rahe hai to unka jawaab tha ki ek sikh hone ke naate vah har roj "sarbat da bhala " (sab kaa bhala) kii aradaas karte hai or sikh dharm main maafee dena acha mana jaataa he
 Therefore, he has forgiven Kejriwal so that he can save time from the court-court and spend it in the well being of the people of Delhi

 Delhi: On the issue of air pollution in NCR, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Ministers of Punjab and Haryana seeking cooperation, to which Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has responded by writing a letter to Kejriwal
 kejariwal ko die gaye jawaab main khatter ne kaha he ki koi bhi sanstha, vyakti yaa sarkaar hawa kii gunvattta behatar nahin kar sakate
 Arvind Kejriwal had sought time to meet the Chief Ministers of the two states for the burning of stubble in the fields in Haryana and Punjab by farmers in delhi-ncr
 punjab ke mukhyamantri ne pradooshan ke liye centre sarkaar ko jimmedaar bataate hue saaf kah diya kipunjab sarkaarake paas kisaanon ko paraali ke badale muaavja dene ke liye paise nahin hai
 Now Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has also responded to his letter to Arvind Kejriwal
 is khat main khatter ne punjab par hi thikra phod diya or arvind kejariwal or unki sarkaar par hi sawaal uthaa diya
 In a letter to Kejriwal, Khattar said that the charges of burning stubble are being made by Kejriwal for political gains
 khatter ne khat ke jariye sawaal uthaaya ki dilli main 4 xxrep 4 0 hectare main paraali jalaae jane ke masale par kejariwal ne kya kadam uthaae hai? khatter kaa daawa he ki unki sarkaar ne 39 karod rupee kharch kar is masale par kadam uthaae hai jabaki punjab main 1 rupaya bhi kharch nahin kiya
 Not only this, in this letter, Manohar Lal Khattar told Arvind Kejriwal that he will be present in Delhi on November 13 and 14, during which Chief Minister Kejriwal can meet him
 lekin arvind kejariwal ke daftar ke sutron kaa daawa he ki lagaataar phone par sampark saadhane ke baad bhi mukhyamantri khatter se milane ke liye unhen samay nahin mil paa rahaa he
 It is obvious that instead of fighting over pollution, the political parties and the chief ministers of the states are busy fighting amongst themselves and in this way the people living in Delhi as well as NCR, Punjab and Haryana are forced to breathe in the toxic smoke

 He saw it shaping his future guided by his democratic and cultural ideals
 jahaan or log naakaam ho gaye, vahaan vah bharat ko duniya ko raah dikhaate dekhnaa chaahati thim
 This made her mission doubly challenging, but Indira Gandhi was not a woman who was afraid of challenges

 Due to this, 12 houses were washed in water and 7 villages were flooded
 maharashtra sarkaar ne dam tuutane kii ghatana kii jaanch ke liye esaiti kaa gathan kiya he
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has ordered a high-level inquiry into the incident
 saath hi rajya ke jal sansaadhan mantri girish mahajan ne ghatnasthal kaa daura kiya
 He assured to work fast in repairing the dam and giving houses to the villagers who lost their homes in the accident

 Water Resources Minister Tanaji Sawant has said that the cracks found in the dam are due to the breakdown of the Tiware Dam located in Ratnagiri district

 Tanaji Sawant said that a large number of crabs are found in this dam, which pierced the dam wall, caused leakage of water and due to this the dam wall was broken

 dilli sarkaar ne ola or ubar jaisi ap-aadhaarit taxi sevaaon ke liye apni policy taiyaar kar lee he, jiske tahat aisi taxi sevaaon ko yatra shuru hone se pehle hi graahak ko sab kuch bataanaa hoga, taaki baad main kisi tarah kii shikaayat kii gunjaaish na rahe
 The main aspects of the policy that have been decided so far are as follows
 graahakon ko kiraaye kii puri jaankaree pehle dene hogi
 
 
 It will be mandatory to install GPS in the taxi
 
 
 sabhi texiyon main meter laga hona chahie
 
 
 No surcharge will be allowed
 
 
 sarkaar dwaara nirdhaarit adhiktam kiraaye se zyaada vasuuli nahin kii ja sakegi
 
 
 According to Delhi's Transport Minister Satyendar Jain, "this policy will prevent the arbitrariness of app-based taxi services
 
 
 policy lagbhag taiyaar he or janata, taxi, autowalon se salaah-mashvire ke baad ise alji sahab (uparajyapal najeeb jang) ke paas manzuri ke liye bheja jayega
 
 
 " asal main ap-aadhaarit taxi sevaaon ke liye abhi tak sarkaar ke paas koi policy nahin thi, jiske chalate in taxi waalon kii manamaani par karrwai karne jab court pahunchaa jaataa tha, to kanoon ke abhaav main aamtaur par unki baat ko hi sahi maananaa padataa tha, lekin is policy ke baad ab sarkaar in texiyon par nakel kas paaegi
 In fact, the government did not yet have a policy for app-based taxi services, due to which, when the court was approached to take action on the arbitrariness of these taxis, they usually had to accept their point of absence in the absence of law
 But, after this policy, now the government will be able to tighten these taxis

 aaj release hui film 'super nani' ek aisi aurat kii kahani he, jo apane ghar-parivaar ko sanvaarane ke liye kai qurbaaniyaan detii he, lekin uskaa pati or uske bachche uski bilkul izzat nahin karte
 
 
 In such an environment, the woman's Nawasa (daughter's son) comes from America and gives a new direction to her persecuted nanny
 
 
 ab duniya is nani ke kadamon main he, or nani-naati milakar parivaar ko sahi raste par laane main jute jate hai
 
 
 Rekha plays the role of 'super Nani' in the film, Sharman Joshi as Nawase, and Rekha's husband Randhir Kapoor
 
 
 film 'super nani' main auraton kii izzat karne kaa sandesh dene kii koshish kii gai he
 
 
 It has been reported that if a woman sacrifices her happiness and desires to groom her home, husband and children, it does not necessarily mean that she has no talent
 
 
 yah bhi dikhaaya gaya he ki agar pati apni patni kii izzat nahin karegaa, to bachche bhi maa kii izzat nahin karenge
 
 
 But it is regrettable that the film 'super Granny' has nothing but message
 
 
 screenple ekadam bachakaana lagata he, or mujhe film dekhte vakt aisa laga, jaise main koi tivi serial dekh rahaa hum
 
 
 The same family, a house, a woman, who has no freedom, a grandson, who keeps on changing her world
 
 
 aapako yah bhi bataa den ki aajkal ke to tivi serial bhi is film se aage nikal chuke hai
 
 
 Such topics will probably be found in today's serials, but perhaps such a husband will not be found who will insult his straightforward wife in front of the public and media
 
 
 haa, rekha kii sundarataa ko dikhaane ke liye kuch puraane gane or chand modelling andaaz ke seen filmaae gaye hai
 
 
 The director of the film Indra Kumar has made films like 'dil', 'beta' and 'raja', which saw an excellent confluence of family drama, romance, music and comedy
 
 
 inke alaava indra kumaar ne 'masti' or 'dhamal' jaisi joardaar kamedi filmein bhi banaai hai, lekin mere hisaab se 'super nani' indra kumaar kii sabase kamazor film he, kyonki is film ke sirf ek-do seens par hi aapako hansi aa sakati he, lekin kai seen aapako melodrama se bhare or atapate lagenge
 
 
 My rating for this film is - 2 stars
