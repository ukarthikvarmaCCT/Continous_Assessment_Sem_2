 There is a saying in the cricket world, 'catch win matches'
 jin tiimon ne cricket main jeet hasil kii he unke khilaadiyon ne kai aise kaich pakade jinase match kaa pasa hi palat gaya
 One of these catches was that which put India in the World Cup trophy
 olerounder or captain kapil dev ne 1983 main west indies ke khilaaf shandaar khel dikhaaya
 He caught a catch running on a swinging ball from Madan Lal and made India's victory easy
 yah kaich tha mahaan ballebaaj viv richards kaa
 To catch this catch, Kapil ran a long run and kept his eye on the ball
 yah kaich aisa tha ki isane jeet kii disha badal di or west indies team se cap chin liya
 This time Australia and South Africa are considered to be tremendous contenders for the World Cup and this is also the reason
 apane samay ke shandaar khilaadi jairan lehaman kaa kahana he, 'itihaas is baat kaa gavaah he ki agar aapaki team sabase acchhee fielding karti he to world cap jeetne kaa aapke liye badhiya mauka he
 'therefore, Australia is being considered as a strong contender
 isi tarah south aprica bhi fielding ke maamle main kisi se kam nahin he
 All his players do great fielding and usually do not miss any catches
 south africa ko is baat kaa shrey he ki antarrashtriya cricket memphilding kaa nayaa maandandunhone hi sthapit kiya
 Who can forget Jonty Rhodes, who is a leopard, who could catch him as soon as he hit the ball with the batsman's bat! He raised the standard of fielding all over the world
 jonty rods bhartiya cricket team ke coach bhi rahe the
 Under his supervision, Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan, Gautam Gambhir etc
 have increased their fielding levels
 gautam gambhir to ab team se baahar hai
 But the rest are in both teams
 viraat kii fielding bahut hi badhiya rahi he lekin pichley kuch dinon se unamem vah bijli vaali teji nahin dikh rahi he
 It is important for him to strengthen his fielding further as the Indian team is struggling with the lack of deadly bowlers at the moment
 viraat or dhawan ke alaava jadeja bhi behtareen fielding karte rahe hai
 He also has high expectations from them
 is baar bharat kii samasya he uski gendbaaji
 He does not have a bowler who wreaks havoc
 aise main fielderon kii jimmedaari bad jaati he
 Missing a single catch can be costly
 har khilaadi ko chaak chauband rahanaa hoga or apni fielding main extra kuch dena hoga
 Every catch, no matter how difficult it is, has to be caught
 is baar hamen yuvaraj singh kii bhi kami khalegi jo ek behtareen fielder hai
 In his absence, it is now up to Jadeja, who holds great fielding
 world cap ke ek match main sabase zyada kaich lene kaa record bharat ke mohammad caff ke naam he
 He took four catches in the ODI played against Sri Lanka in the 2002-03 World Cup
 team india ke ekanath solkar or yajuvendra singh kii chitah jaisi fielding ke kaaran bharat ne pratidwandviyon ko pareshaani main daale rakhaa
 Former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin also set a record for taking five catches in an innings
 agar bharat ko yah cap jeetna he to sabhi khilaadiyon ko iskaa dhyaan rakhana hoga ki koi bhi kaich naa chute
 Every missed catch will take him away from the cup
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi upie adhyaksh or apni maa sonia gandhi se zyada sakht hai
 This claim is not made by anyone else but Rahul Gandhi himself
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko rahul gandhi kii adhyakshata main dilli pradesh congress kii ahm baithak hui
 Rahul said these things during this meeting
 sutron ke mutabik, party main gutbaji par rahul gandhi ne kaha, 'main congress adhyaksh (sonia gandhi) kii tarah naram nahin hum
 i will take strong action against factionalism in the party
 ' isi ke saath unhone party netaaon ko nirdesh diya ki sarkaar or party kaaryakarta achche kaamon ko janata ke bich pahunchaaya jaae
 In the meeting, Rahul Gandhi pulled the ministers fiercely
 unhone kaha ki mantri kaaryakartaaon ke liye uplabdh nahin hote hai, jabaki unhen janata ke bich jaakar pasinaa bahaanaa chahie
 This meeting is considered to be very important before the election because in this Rahul Gandhi finalized the party's election strategy as well as reviewed the functioning of the party
 baithak main dilli pradesh ke saansadon or vidhayakon ke alaava saare parshad or jila or block str ke adhyaksh bhi shaamil the

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bharat main badhate ghuspaith ke prayaason par gahari chintaa jataate hue aantarik suraksha ke prati khataron se nipatane ke liye kendra or rajyon ke bich behatar talmail karne kii zarurat bataai
 In the meeting of Chief Ministers held on internal security, Singh said that left-wing extremism, cross-border terrorism, rebellion in the Northeast and airing communal and regional tensions are the main challenges of internal security and these threats are faced by the Center and States
 The middle can be done only with good coordination
 unhone kaha, hamaari suraksha ke prati bade khataron se aap sab avgat hai
 Hostile groups and elements take cross-border action to carry out terrorist operations in our country
 jammu-kashmir in samoohon kii karravaayiyon kaa khamiyaaza bhugat rahaa he
 The Prime Minister said that fake currency notes of Indian currency are also being printed from across the border in our market
 unhone kaha ki jaali mudra ke prasar par roak ke liye rajyon ko aapas main or adhik talmail karnaa chahie or iske liye vishisht agenciyaan bhi banani chahie
 The Prime Minister reiterated his stand that extremist left-wing extremism like Naxalism and Maoism are the biggest threats to internal security
 unhone kaha ki seemaa pariy aatankwaad or ativaadee vampanthi ugravad desh ke liye sabase bade khatre to hai hi, lekin inke saath hi ‘‘kuch tatv aise bhi hai jo hamaare samaaj ko sampradayikta or kshetreeyata main baantne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 "to deal with all these dangers, he said that we need to be" committed, hard working and constantly alert "
 unhone kaha ki jammu-kashmir main 2008 ke mukaable 2009 main aatanki ghatnaon main kaaphi kami ai he lekin isi avadhi main ghuspaith kaa str badha he
 "recently there have been some incidents which are disturbing
 ’’ ativaadee vampanthi ugravad ko desh kii suraksha ke bade khataron main se ek bataate hue unhone kaha ki isse nipatate samay is baat kaa khyaal rakhaa jaae ki inase hamaari janata, khaskar adivasee hamase vimukh nahin ho jaaen
 He said that social and economic development should be undertaken along with dealing with extremists in the areas affected by Naxalite violence
 un kshetron ke logon ko rashtriya vikaas kii mukhyadhara main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 The Prime Minister hoped that all states would make "full potential use" of the National Investigation Agency set up by the Center for a powerful and united fight against terrorism
 unhone kaha ki yah isliye bhi zaruri he, kyonki aaj kii duniya main bahut se mudde aise hai jinase nipatane ke liye keval rajyon ke bich hi nahin, balki kendra or rajyon main bhi nazadiiki samanvay kii zarurat he
 Singh said, "internal security is definitely one of these issues, as it affects our peace, and our growth and development
 ’’unhone sabhi mukhyamantriyon se apil kii ki ve apane apane rajyon main vishesh jaanch agenciyaan or drut pratikriya dal gathit karen

 unhone police dhaanche kaa vikaas karne or unke prashikshan ko behatar banane ke liye in madon ke liye rajyon ke bajet aavanton main badhottaree karne ko kaha
 Earlier, Home Minister p Chidambaram stressed on strengthening the state police forces, especially intelligence cells and specialized units, to effectively deal with internal security problems including terrorist threats
 unhone kaha ki pichley 14 maheenon main desh main koi bada aatanki hamalaa or sampradayik hinsa nahin hui he, jo santosh kii baat he
 But this does not mean that there is no risk of such incidents happening
 grih mantri ne kaha ki aise main ‘‘hamen sadaa sachet or satark rahane kii aavashyaktaa he
 We must continue to increase our capabilities
 saath hi hamen aatanki hamalon tathaa sampradayik tanaavon kii ashankaon ko rokane ke liye apane shashan kii vyavastha tathaa sansthaanon main sudhaar karnaa hoga
 He said that organizations like lashkar-e-taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, responsible for carrying out deadly terrorist attacks in India, recently held a meeting in Muzaffarabad of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and this is a clear indication that these groups are strongly opposed to India
 chidambaram ne kaha ki in aatanki samoohon ke hathiyaar tabaahi or hinsa he or unka lakshya kashmir kaa balaat haran karnaa he
 We will defeat them whenever and wherever we face them

 vaidic parampara or hindu manyataon ke anusaar pitaron ke liye shraddha se shraadh karnaa ek mahaan or utkrisht kaary he
 According to the belief, the sonhood of a son is considered meaningful only when he serves the surviving parents during his lifetime and duly performs his obeisance on his death date (barsi) and Mahalaya (pitrupaksha)
 aswin krishna paksh pratipada se asina maheene kii amavasya tak ko pitrupaksh yaa mahalaya paksh kaha gaya he
 According to belief, Pindadan is a simple and easy path to salvation
 aise to desh ke haridwar, gangasagar, kurukshetra, chitrakoot, pushkar sahit kai sthanon main bhagwaan pitaron ko shraddhapurvak kiye gaye shraadh se moksh pradaan kar dete hai, lekin gaya main kiye gaye shraadh kii mahima kaa gungan to bhagwaan ram ne bhi kiya he
 It is said that Lord Rama and Sitaji also offered pindadan in Gaya for the peace of King Dasharatha's soul
 aacharyon ke mutabik janamanas main yah aam dharna he ki ek parivaar se koi ek hi 'gaya' karata he
 To perform Gaya means to worship the ancestors in the Gaya, to perform the pinddaan
 garuda puraana main likhaa gaya he ki gaya jane ke liye ghar se nikalne par chalane vaale ek-ek kadam pitaron ke swargarohan ke liye ek-ek seedhi banate jate hai
 'grihachalitamatamasya Gayaan'

 'gaya is considered the city of Vishnu
 yah moksh kii bhoomi kehalaati he
 It is also discussed in Vishnu Purana and Vayu Purana
 vishnu puraana ke mutabik gaya main pindadaan karne se purvajon ko moksh mil jaataa he or ve swarg chale jate hai
 Vishnu himself is believed to be present as the ancestral deity here, hence it is also known as the 'pitru Tirtha'
 gaya ke panda ramanand kehete hai ki phalgu nadi ke tat par pindadaan kiye bina pindadaan ho hi nahin saktaa
 The process of pindadan starts from the banks of the Punpun River
 aise to pratipada se pindadaan kiya jaataa he parantu poornima se bhi kai log pindadaan karne lagate hai
 According to mythological beliefs and legends, a demon named Gaiasur, in the lineage of Bhasmasura, after a hard penance, sought a boon from Brahmaji that his body be sanctified like the gods and people would be freed from the mere sight of him
 is vardaan ke milane ke baad swarg kii jansankhya badhane lagi or prakritik niyam ke vipareet sab kuch hone laga
 People started committing sin without fear and sins started getting rid of Gaya's vision
 isse bachane ke liye devataaon ne yajna ke liye pavitra sthal kii maang gayasur se maangi
 Gaiasur gave his body for the yajna of the gods
 jab gayasur leta to uskaa sharir paanch kos main fail gaya
 The same went in place of five Kos but Gayaasur's heart did not wish to free the people from sin and then asked for a boon from the Gods that this place should remain the Tarna (liberation) people
 jo bhi log yahaan par kisi kaa tarpan karne kii ichha se pindadaan karen, unhen mukti mili
 This is the reason that even today people come to Gaya for pinddaan to wrangle their fathers
 kaha jaataa he ki gaya main pehle vibhinn naamon kii 360 vediyaan thim, jahaan pindadaan kiya jaataa tha
 Of these, only 48 are left
 haalanki kai dharmik sansthaaen un puraani vediyon kii khoj kii maang kar rahi hai
 At the present time, people offer the offerings and ancestors of ancestors on these altars
 pindadaan ke liye prativarsh gaya main desh-videsh se lakhon log aate hai

 puraa intervyuuvaidhchhoushkai: kejariwal bole- modi-shah ne 5 saal main bedaa gark kiya, desh bachaana jaruri The Maharashtra government has decided to further tighten the security of terrorist Ajmal Kasab, accused of terrorist attack on Mumbai
 kasaab ko ab arthur road jail kii sabase surakshit anda cell main rakhaa jayega
 Where the most feared and vicious criminals are imprisoned
 yahi nahin kasaab ke liye jail main hi court banane kaa bhi faisla kiya gaya he
 Maharashtra Home Minister Jayant Patil said that Ajmal Kasab is the only terrorist of the Mumbai attack, who is alive, hence it has been decided to keep Kasab in the country's safest egg cell
 anda cell main kareeb 10 kamare hai
 Each room is about 6 feet wide and 8 feet tall
 kamaron kii banaavat aisi he ki koi bhi kaidi duusare ko naa to dekh saktaa he or naa hi baat kar saktaa he
 While bringing the egg to the cell, the face of the prisoner is covered with a cloth so that the rest of the prisoners do not know who is the new prisoner coming to the cell
 anda cell main kaam karne vaale jail karmchaariyon kaa stoff bhi alag he
 The second prison staff is not allowed to enter the egg cell
 anda cell ke baahar har vakt kareeb dhai darjan police waalon kii duty rahati he
 It is clear from keeping terrorist Kasab under such strong security that the Maharashtra government does not want to compromise on Kasab's security
 mumbai hamale main jinda bache iklaute aatanki ko khone kii keemat bharat bakhubi jaanata he
 In fact, after the terrorist attack on Mumbai, on the basis of terrorist Kasab's statement and the evidence from him, India has put pressure on Pakistan, which has increased the importance of Kasab immensely
 kasaab ke paas abhi mumbai hamale se judi or aatank ke aakaaon kii kuch or pukhta jaankariyaan bhi ho sakati hai, jo aties usase ugalvaanaa chaahati he
 For this reason, it has been decided to keep Kasab under such strong security

 Batting king Sachin Tendulkar's record 51st Test century and Harbhajan Singh's two tremors helped India consolidate their position in the third and final Test cricket match by sending South Africa to the backfoot on Tuesday
 tendulkar ne 146 ran banaaye jiske liye unhone 465 minute krij par bitaaye or is bich 314 gend kaa saamana karke 17 chauke or do chakke lagaaye
 With this innings, India managed to get a modest two-run lead by scoring 364 runs
 apni pehali pari main 362 ran banane vaale dakshin africa ne tisare din kaa khel samaapt hone tak do wicket par 52 ran banaaye the or use abhi 50 ran kii badhat hasil he
 The third day was named after Tendulkar, who scored the second century in the series, and made the Indians heavy
 unhone is bich gautam gambhir ( 93) ke saath tisare wicket ke liye 176 ran or harbhajan singh (40) ke saath saatven wicket ke liye 76 ran kii saajhedaariyaan kii
 Dale Steyn was South Africa's most successful bowler
 unhone 75 ran dekar paanch wicket liye
 Smith (29) and Alviro Peterson gave South Africa a good start but Harbhajan gave India two successes within 11 balls shortly before the end of the day's play
 smith unki gudleyngth gend ko baikfoot par jaakar khelnaa chaahate the lekin vah chook gayi or pagabaadha hokar pavilion laute
 After this, nightwatchman Paul Harris (zero) suffered the expense of not playing his ball and he was also lbw
 stump ukhdane ke samay petersan (naabad 22) ke saath hashim amala khel rahe the jinhen abhi apana khaataa kholana he
 Tendulkar completed his 50th run with one run off the bowling of Stan
 iske baad yah star ballebaaj haalanki jam gaya or unhone krij ke donon taraf kuch achche shaat lagaaye
 Gambhir was also slowly progressing towards the century but he returned to the pavilion after falling prey to nervous nerves
 baayen haath ke spinner paal haris kii ‘raf aria’ kii gayi gend ko gambhir ne baikfoot par jaakar khilne kii koshish kii lekin vah unke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar wicketiper mark bouchar ke paas pahunch gayi
 Gambhir played 222 balls in his innings and hit 13 fours
 gambhir kii jagah par utre vivies lakshmana (15) acchhee lay main dikh rahe the
 He hit three fours as soon as he came, but he had to run out of the pavilion in a very unfortunate way
 vidambnaa dekhiye ki tab haris ne tendulkar kaa kaich chhod diya tha lekin is par lakshmana ran out ho gayi
 Tendulkar went ahead and shot but only bowler Harris could touch him
 lakshmana tab krij se baahar the or gend nonstriker chor par wicket par lag gayi
 Steyn dismissed Dhoni in the next over
 gend tab teji se swing hokar aaf stump se baahar nikal rahi thi jise bhartiya captain ne khilne kii koshish kii lekin vah unke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar teesri slip main eshwel prince ke paas pahunch gayi
 Harbhajan initially showed some quickness but later he preferred to play like Tendulkar, allowing India to score 79 runs in 25 overs in the second session
 harbhajan ne is bich haalanki sten kii ged par chakka jadkar test cricket main 2000 ran puure kiye
 Tendulkar taught Harris a similar lesson after the tea break
 sten ne harbhajan ko out karke yah saajhedaari todi
 Harbhajan tried to pull on the bouncer but it did not hit his bat properly and was run into a catch by substitute fielder JP Duminy in deep square leg
 harbhajan kii 67 gend kii pari main teen chauke or do chakke shaamil hai
 Tendulkar's batting innings was finally concluded by Morkel, whose ball was off his stump and was uprooted
 iske baad bhartiya pari simtane main der nahin lagi
 Zaheer Khan (23), however, managed to take the Indian score ahead of South African totals by hitting two sixes on Stan

 -jon abraham With the announcement of election date in Bihar, the exercise to woo the general voters has intensified
 buudhvaar ko rajya main vidhansabha chunaav kii taarikh ke elaan se thik pehle kendra or rajya sarkaar donon ne votaron ko lubhaane se judin mahatvapurn ghoshnaaen kin
 After the first Union Cabinet meeting, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that dearness allowance of about one crore employees and pensioners of Central Government has been increased by 6%
 phir kuch hi minuton baad nitish sarkaar ne bhi jawaab main bihar sarkaar ke sabhi karmchaariyon or pensionbhogiyon kaa mahangaai bhatta 6 % badhaane kaa elaan kar diya
 That is, the exercise to woo voters continued till the last minute before the announcement of election dates
 isse pehle kendra sarkaar bihar ke baadh thermal power plant ke liye koyale kii supplai kaa rasta saaf kar chuki thi
 After an important cabinet meeting, Power Minister Piyush Goyal announced that ntpc's thermal power plant will now be provided with coal linkage through coal linkage in Bihar floods
 is faisle se sthaneey logon ko kaaphi phayda hoga
 The comments jedy-you ne jawaab dene main jaraa bhi deree nahin kii
 The party's General Secretary KC Tyagi claimed that Nitish Kumar has been demanding coal linkage for years and it is a good thing that the Center finally accepted the demand of Nitish government
 haalanki tyaagi ne is ahm faisle ke elaan kii timming par sawaal uthaate hue aarope lagaaya ki yah raajnneetik rishwat dene jaisaa maamla he
 Tyagi told NDTV that even though the Model Code of Conduct has not been breached a few minutes before the date announcement, it is an attempt to woo voters and the Election Commission should take cognizance of it

 Earlier, the central government had cleared the way for the supply of coal to the flood thermal power plant of Bihar
 cabinet kii ek ahm baithak ke baad bijli mantri piyush goyal ne elaan kiya ki bihar ke baadh main antipisi ke thermal power plant ko ab kol linkage ke jariye koyale kii pakki supplai kii suvidha muhaiyaa karai jayega

 Tyagi, however, questioned the timing of the announcement of this important decision and alleged that it was a case of political bribe
 tyaagi ne enditivi se kaha ki taarikh ke elaan se kuch hi minute pehle is elaan se bhale hi model code of conduct kaa ulanghan na hua ho, lekin yah votaron ko lubhaane kii ek koshish he or chunaav ayog ko iskaa sangyaan lenaa chahie

 maut kii aisi script shaayad hi isse pehle kabhi likhi gai ho
 In the script, death came in the same way on everyone's part as it was written
 berogari, beemaari, bhukhmaree, tangi, dabaav, tanaav amuman ye hi wo vajah hoti hai, jisaki vajah se log khudakushi karte hai
 But the reason of death in this story is strange and the way of death is also unique
 pench itane ki ye pataa lagaana bhi mushkil he ki kisne kiske gale main fanda daalaa or kisne kiske pairon ke neeche se stool khiskaaya
 Like script like death! 1
 guuruuvaar yaa ravivaar ke din kaa chunaav karen or unhone ravivaar ko hi chunaa
 2
 ankhon par pattiyaan achche se baandhna he
 Nothing should appear other than zero
 rassi ke saath sooti chunniyaan yaa sari kaa prayog karnaa he
 And they did so
 gyaarah marane waalon main se 9 kii ankhon par pattiyaan bandhi thi
 3
 saat dinon ke baad puja lagaataar karnaa he
 Worship has to be done with a little dedication and devotion
 lekin agar ghar main koi aa jaae, to agle din
 And they did so
 maut se pehle ghar main puja kiye jane nishaan mili hai
 4
 bebbe agar khadi nahin ho sakati he, to wo alag kamare main let sakati hai
 On the spot, only the body of Babbe was found lying on the bed in the inner room
 5
 Use dimming light
 or isi ke chalate ghar main maddhim raushnee jal rahi thi
 The corpses were hanging from the mesh of the roof
 6
 If the straps of hands remain, double them on the eyes
 or sachmuch 8 logon ke haath peeche kii ore kas kar bandhe the, kai kii ankhon par pattiyaan bhi dabl thim
 7
 munh kii pattiyon ko bhi rumal se dabl kar lenaa
 And literally many members of the family had a double napkin tied on their mouths
 8
 The more perseverance and reverence you show, the more appropriate you will get
 or is makaan main rahane vaale sabhi ke sabhi 11 logon kii maut ek saath hi hui
 9
 raat ke 12 baje se lekar 1 baje ke bich kaary karnaa he or uske pehle havan karnaa he
 And everyone died at midnight
 havan-pujan ke nishaan bhi mili
 10
 sabaki soch ek jaisi honi chahie
 More strongly than before
 ye karte hi tumhaare aage kaa kaam shighrata se shuru hoga
 And eleven deaths together indicate that he was adamant
 11
 The door of the house should be open at the time of this work
 or agle din subah jab ek padosi unke ghar pahunchaa, to daravaaza sachmuch khulaa hua tha
 12
 phone pareshaani kii ek badi vajah he
 It should be kept away
 or sachmuch ghar ke sadasyon ke kul 8 mobile phone or ek tablet ek daraaj main band mili
 The register entangled the mystery of death
 Eleven mass deaths in a house in Burari area of delhi shocked the entire country, not only Delhi
 lekin gyaarah mauton vaale is makaan se baraamad ek register or ek diary ne in mauton ke rahasy ko thodaa or gaharaa kar diya he
 This register was found kept in the place of worship in the house
 isamen moksh prapti ke liye khudakushi karne kaa tareeqa likhaa tha
 Incidentally, whatever was written in the register, the circumstances of the house and the deaths there were exactly the same
 samuhik mauton ke peeche tantra mantra?ek hi handriting se is register main likhane kii shuruyaat disambar 2017 se hui, jabaki 26 june ko is register ke chaar pej ek saath bhare gaye
 In the register itself, on June 30, it was written that we should meet God
 or ye mautein bhi 30 june or 1 july kii darmyaani raat ko hi hui
 So, was the cause of these eleven deaths an attempt to attain salvation through tantra-mantra? Or is it the secret? If the deaths have been caused by tantra-mantra, then who is the person who was telling them tantra-mantra and the manner of death? The case of 2 or 3 people behind 11 deaths is strange in itself
 ajeeb isliye ki ek parivaar ke 11 log ek saath marane ke liye taiyaar ho jaaen wo bhi aaj ke is daur main moksh prapti ke liye
 To meet the divine
 aisa mumkin nahin lagata
 The Delhi Police investigation says almost the same
 police kahati he in 11 mauton ke peeche 2 yaa 3 logon kaa haath he
 The remaining people have been put to death by putting them in some misunderstanding or cheating
 teen laashon ke haath the khulekya ek saath 11 log bilkul kareeb khadey hokar khudakushi kar sakate hai, jawaab he nahin
 Then the question is how did this happen in this house
 is sawaal kaa jawaab khud laash ugal rahi hai
 In fact, out of the 11 corpses found, three were corpses with both hands open
 inamen ek lalit tha, doosraa lalit kii patni tina or teesraa lalit kaa bhai bhuwanesh
 If the police believe, the first death in this house was that of Lalit's elderly mother
 iske baad baaki ko baari baari se maaraa gaya
 And then came Tina's turn
 tina ke baad bhuwanesh kii or phir sabase aakhir main jo mara wo khud lalit tha
 Eyes, mouths were bandied In the house of Bandiburadi, in a hall about 15 feet wide and 20 feet long, the bodies of ten people were hanging from the ceiling on the roof
 jabaki 77 saal kii ek bujurg mahila kii laash usee manzil ke ek kamare main bistar par padi thi
 That means a total of eleven corpses
 marane vaale gyaarah logon main se 8 ke haath peeche kii ore bandhe hue the, jabaki kareeb sabhi ke sabhi kii ankhon or munh par pattee bandhi thi or kaan main rui thunsi hui thi
 Only Bhuvanesh and Lalit and Lalit's wife Tina, the two sons of elderly Narayani Devi, had their hands open
 lalit, tina or bhuwanesh par shakaise main maukey par pahunchi police kii nazar sabase pehle bhuwanesh, lalit or tina kii laashon ke khule hue haathon par hi gayi
 At present, the police investigating the case suspects that these three together probably killed the remaining eight people in the family and then they themselves committed suicide in the end
 is makaan main mili ek diary or register main likhi baaten in mauton ke peeche tantra mantra or moksh ke liye khudakushi kiye jane kaa shaq paidaa karte hai
 But the question is also that at the same time how can so many people be ready for suicide? In such a situation, the suspicion goes to Bhuvanesh, Lalit and Tina with open arms
 bahut dharmik the lalit or tinapulice sutron kii maane to lalit or tina donon behad dharmik kism ke the or balaji ke bade bhakt the
 Perhaps he, along with Bhuvanesh, prepared a complete plan of murder and suicide to attain salvation
 chunki parivaar ke sabhi ke sabhi logon ko iske liye taiyaar nahin kiya ja saktaa tha, isliye baaki ke aath logon kaa qatl dhokhe se kiya gaya
 In this episode, Babbey, the elderly mother of 77 years, Narayani Devi was killed
 jabaki baaki ke logon kii baari uske baad ai
 All of them were bandaged over their eyes and mouth, while hands were tied behind
 vidhi ko puraa karne kii kasam!police ko shaq he ki shaayad inhen aankh-munh par pattee baandhne or haath peeche kii ore baandhne ko ek prakriya ke taur par samajhaayaa gaya or is vidhi ko puraa karne ke liye qasam khilaai gai
 It is doubtful that they were told that everything will be back to normal after going through this process
 lekin iske baad inhen dhokhe se fande se lataka kar maar daalaa gaya
 According to the police, after this Bhuvnesh and Tina again committed suicide towards the end, Lalit also gave his life
 police ko mili shuruaati postmortem report ke mutabik sabhi kii maut gale main lage fandon kii vajah se dam ghutane se hone kii baat kahi gai he
 Which corresponds to the theory of hanging corpses
 philhal, police kai angel is maamle kii chaanbin kar rahi he

 The current Indian team is fulfilling my dreams
 sani ne kaha, ‘kohli or unki team kaa vijay abhiyaan shandaar he
 This team is performing strongly in Test cricket
 ve meraa sapana puraa kar rahe hai
 Gavaskar was talking to former Indian batsman VVS Laxman at an event to mark 40 years of his book 'sunny Days'
 duniya ke mahanatam openron main shumaar gavaskar ne kaha ki jab virendra sahvaag bhartiya team main aae to tab unhone kisi aise ballebaaj ko dekha jo is tarah se gend kaa hit karata tha jaisaa kabhi vah chaahate the
 However, many years after Gavaskar retired from international cricket, Virender Sehwag started his career
 gavaskar ne kaha, ‘main hameshaa test match kii pehali gend ko sidhe chakke ke liye bhejnaa chahta tha
 i was able to do this only once but Sehwag did it regularly
 vah behtareen ballebaaj the jo saahasik shot kheltaa tha
 Regarding the criticism of cricket's youngest format T20, he said, "the truth is that T20 has done some great things for the game and has increased the importance of the game in many ways
" ’gauratlab he ki sunil gavaskar test cricket main 10 hajaar ran kaa aankada paar karne vaale duniya ke pehle ballebaaj the
 He scored 51 in 125 tests
 12 ke ausat se 10122 ran banaae jisamen 34 shatak shaamil the
 His highest score was 236 * during this period
 khaas baat yah ki gavaskar ne apane puure kariyar ke dauraan kabhi helmet lagaakar batting nahin kii
 Sehwag also accepted the challenge of starting the innings on the advice of Ganguly
 unhone test cricket main 49
 He scored more than 8 thousand runs at an average of 34, including 23 centuries

 hyderabad kii ghatana par bayaan dete hue samaajawaadee party kii saansad jaya bachchan (jaya Bachchan) ne rajyasabha main kaha ki hyderabad se main jis tareeke kii ghatana hui he usamen shaamil logon ko public ke hawaale kar dena chahie
 He said that it would be very harsh behavior, but these people should be handed over to the public, so that the public should punish them
 jaya bachchan ke rajyasabha main diye is bayaan par chaaron taraf se riection aane shuru ho gaye hai
 But on this statement, 'bigg Boss' ex-contestant and political analyst Tehseen Poonawalla is seen raging
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone twit kar jaya bachchan ke is bayaan par aapatti bhi jataai he
 These mps are the problem! With lawmakers like # jayabachchan, instead of improving the implementation of the law, asking for scientific investigations & special courts & fast trials she wants people to be lynched
 Absolutely bizarre! This will actually make he law &order worse! https: / / t
 co / 7ipempchzp Tehseen Poonawalla expressed anger at Jaya Bachchan's statement, writing, "these mps are the problem
" jaya bachchan jaise kanoon nirmaataa, kanoon kaa sudhaar karne kii jagah, vishesh adaalaton main twarit karrwai or vaigyanik jaanch ke bajaay vah logon ko bheed ke hawaale karnaa chaah rahi hai
 This is quite surprising
 yah cheez vastav main kanoon vyavastha ko or bhi bekaar bana degaa
 "tehseen Poonawala's tweet for Jaya Bachchan is becoming very viral on social media, as well as people are fiercely expressing their opinion on it
 How can a MP call for lynching ?have we thought what will happen if wrong people are accused?are we a feudal ancient society?we need the law of the land to act swiftly not lynching? There is NO lynching in Scandinavian & European countries
 
 why are rapes less there??is twit ke alaava tahseen poonawala (tehseen Poonawalla) ne jaya bachchan (jaya Bachchan) ke bayaan par ek or twit kiya, jisamen unhone sawaal khadaa karte hue likhaa ki ek saansad linching ke liye kaise bol sakati hai? unhone twit main likhaa, "ek saansad linching ke liye kaise kah sakati hai? kya hamane kabhi sochaa he ki agar galat vyakti is maamle main funs jaae to kya hoga? kya ham pracheen samaaj main hai? hamen teji se karrwai karne ke liye kanoon kii aavashyaktaa he, linching kii nahin
 There is nothing like lynching in Scandinavian and European countries

 saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon ke pramukhon ke saath baatcheet main das ne is baat par bhi gaur kiya ki banking kshetra main sudhaar aa rahaa he or yah majboot bana hua he

 In view of this, the Reserve Bank of India also lowered the economic growth forecast for the current year to five percent

 supreme court main maamle kii agali sunwaayee sunwaayee 8 july ko hogi
 It was believed that Kirahul Gandhi would not appear in the lower court after getting relief from the Supreme Court, but the news of his appearance in court was announced on Friday through the Twitter handle of Rahul
 We respect the judiciary, that is why i am here
 i had made a commitment to the court
 i am here to fulfill that commitment
 : Rahul Gandhi — Office of RG (@officeofrg) May 8, 2015 What was the matter? In March 2014, Rahul Gandhi said that Mahatma Gandhi was murdered by the Sangh in Bhiwandi, Maharashtra
 congress upaadhyaksh ne aresas par hamalaa karte hue bijepi netaaon ke un daavon kaa bhi majaak udaaya tha ki bijepi desh main computer lekar ai he
 Addressing a public meeting, the Congress vice-president had said that RSS people killed Gandhiji and today his people (BJP) discuss him
 rahul ne kaha tha ki aresas ne sardaar patel or gandhiji kaa virodh kiya tha
 The BJP has targeted the government ahead of the budget session
 adwani ne kaha ki bhrashtachar ke sabhi maamalon kii jaanch jepisi se karwaai jaae
 Before the budget session of Parliament starts, BJP has started preparing to surround the government
 bajet satr ke liye ranneeti tay karne ke liye kolkata main mangalvaar ko bijepi ke varisht netaaon or bijepi ke sabhi mukhyamantriyon kii baithak hui
 After this, BJP rallied in Kolkata
 bijepi ne mahangaai, bhrashtachar or kaale dhan par sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa
 BJP has also demanded a JPC probe into the 2G scam as well as other recent scams
 aadhaar kii vaidhata or anivaaryta parasupreme courtka charchit faisla aane ke baad voter card koadharase jodne kii nirvachan ayog kii puraani muhim ko phir nai urja mil gai he
 The Commission is studying the opinion of the legal experts in light of this decision
 kyonki faisle main aadhaar ko voter card se jodne par koi nishedh nahin he
 For example, the Supreme Court's rulings on the legitimacy of Aadhaar and decriminalizing electoral politics have cleared the way for the Election Commission to link voter ID cards (voter ids) to Aadhaar and expedite measures to prevent criminals from contesting elections
 
 mukhya chunaav ayukta o pi ravat ne in faislon ko lagu karne ke bare main saaf kiya ki nirvachan ayog ne apane vidhi sachivalay ko donon faislon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye kaha he
 This ambitious project to link Voter ID to Aadhaar had to be stopped in the middle of the case as the Supreme Court is under consideration
 ab faisle ke adhyayan ke baad adaalat ke aadesh ke anuroop ise phir se shuru kiya ja sakegaa
 Similarly, in the second judgment, the Supreme Court has prohibited criminals from contesting elections
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke is faisle ko lagu karne ke sambandh main ravat ne kaha ki ayog is faisle kaa bhi adhyayan kar ise samuchit taur par lagu karne ke upaay karegaa
 Explain that the Supreme Court, in its decision, has entrusted the responsibility of passing information on criminal cases against tainted candidates to voters through various means
 ayog ne matadaata suchi ko zyada vishwast banane ke liye farvari 2015 main aadhaar se matadaata pahchaan patr ko jodne kii yojana par kaam shuru kiya tha
 Only 6 months later, in August 2015, the case of Aadhaar's validity and misuse reached the threshold of the Supreme Court
 isse yah yojana khatai main pad gai
 But within 6 months, the identity cards of about 33 crore voters had been linked to Aadhaar
 ravat ne is pariyojna ko aagaamee vidhansabha orloksabhaa chunaavse pehle puraa karne ke sawaal par kaha ki visheshgyon ke faisle ke baad yojana ko shuru kar kaam ko yathashighra puraa karne kii koshish hogi
 On the question of the role of the commission in implementing the court's decision to keep candidates with criminal background away from elections, Rawat said that after studying the verdict, it will be decided how much change will be made in the prescribed application and questionnaire related to the candidates
 Will happen
 unhone bataaya ki prakriya main jarurat ke mutabik badlaav kar ummidavaaron ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamalon kii jaankaree se matadaataaon ko avgat karaane ke upaay kiye jaaenge
 On the question of implementing the changed system before the possible assembly elections of five states this year, Rawat said, "the Commission always tries to implement the decision of the court in a possible close election
 philhal itnaa hi kaha ja saktaa he ki ayog is disha main twarit prayaas karegaa
 So that they can be implemented as soon as possible

 The truth is that after one year, no visible benefits of demonetisation are visible to anyone and perhaps that is why BJP is mentioning the benefits of demonetisation as a poster everywhere, on the other hand, the Congress party is also showing its view on demonetisation as poster
 It is presenting itself

 In the second poster, BJP is also claiming that the incidents of stone pelting in Jammu and Kashmir are counting the second benefit of demonetisation
 saath hi notebandi se taxperes badhane kaa bhi daawa jagah-jagah poster laga kar kiye ja rahe hai
 In response to all the posters of the BJP, the Congress has placed only one poster everywhere, in which the Congress has called the day of demonetisation as an organized loot

 Regarding the poster war demonetisation, which was spread through colorful posters, both sides put their respective views in front of the public

 One such amazing invention is done by 15 year old girl Regan Jamalova
 jisane ek aisi divaais bana di he jisase barish kii buundon se bijli ban sakati he
 Let's know how this device will be
 regaan jamalova ajarbaijan (purvi europe or asia ke madhya main basaa hua muslim desh) kii rahane vaali hai
 She is 15 years old and a 9th grade student
 12veen main hue fail, phir shuru kiya ye bijness, ab bane karodapatikaise aayaa divaais banane kaa idia9veen kaksha main padhane vaali jamalova ne ek baar apane pita se poocha ki jab hawa se bijli ban sakati he to barish se kyon nahin ban sakati? pita is sawaal kaa jawaab to nahin de paae
 But Jamalova had a restless mind to know the answer to this question
 jiske baad usne sochaa kyon na is sawaal kaa jawaab khud hi khoj liya jaae
 It was from here that Jamalova got the idea to make electricity from the raindrops
 dost kii lee madadbaarish kii buundon se bijli banane vaale divaais ko bananaa aasaan nahin tha
 For this Jamalova enlisted the help of her friend Jahra
 jiske baad donon ladkiyaan bijli banane kii divaais taiyaari karne main lag jute gai
 Both the girls prepared the device on their own
 donon ne apni physics teacher kii bhi madad lee
 This is the name of the device Jamalova has given the name of 'renergy' to make electricity from rain drops
 aapako bataa den, ye idia itnaa shandaar tha ki donon ko ajarbaijan sarkaar ne 20 hajaar dollar rupee die
 Let us tell you, the length of this device that produces electricity from rain is 9 meters
 is divaais ke chaar hisse hai- renwater colector, electric jenerator, bydaree or water tanks
 Used to live by selling milk in my childhood, now run my own bank! How this device works, the device named 'energy' works easily
 sabase pehle tanks main colector ke jariye pani bharna padataa he jisase janarator on hota he or phir bijli utpann hoti he
 The electricity it produces is stored in the battery
 jiske baad us bijli kaa istemaal gharon main lits jalaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Let me tell you, the Rainergy device is currently a prototype
 jisamen abhi litre tak kaa pani aa saktaa he
 But it has so much electricity that three LED lights can light up
 is divaais kii khaasiyat ye he ki ye eco-friendli hai jis vajah se isamen kisi bhi tarah kaa pradooshan nahin failata
 Let me tell you, there are many countries in the world where it rains year-round
 jaise:- philippine, malaysia or bharat jaise deshon ne is prototip par kaam karne ke liye ajarbaijan kii sarkaar se sampark bhi kiya he
 Jamalova said that my device will help the countries where there is more power shortage
 isse bijli kii samasya dur ho sakati he

 17veen shatabdi ke aitihaasik dharohar dilli sthit laal kile ko daalamia group ko saunpe jane kii khabar soshal media ke saath-saath raajnneetik patal par bhi achaanak teji se chaa gai
 People said on social media that the Modi government sold the Red Fort and now the next turn is to the Taj Mahal
 vahiin congress, argedy, aam aadmi party, pashchim bengal kii siem mamata banerjee samet tamaam vipakshi dalon or netaaon ne modi sarkaar ko nishane par liya or kaha ki sarkaar aitihaasik imaaraton ko udyogpattiyon ko bech rahi he
 This case sparked a new debate
 yahaan yah jaananaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki aitihaasik dharoharon ko lekar desh main kanoon kya he, inaki dekharekh koun karata he or kya koi sarkaar chaahe to aitihaasik dharoharon ko kisi ko bech sakati he? ham yahaan in saare sawaalon ke jawaab dene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 What has been decided about the Red Fort? Actually, an mou was signed between the Ministry of Tourism, Archeology Survey of India and Dalmia Bharat Group
 jiske tahat company ko paanch saal ke liye laal kila or iske aas paas ke paryatak kshetra ke rakh-rakhaav or vikaas kii jimmedaari mil gai
 Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma says - To increase public participation in the maintenance of historical heritage, last year, the Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Culture started a scheme in collaboration with the Department of Archeology, called the Adopt a Heritage Scheme
 iske tahat koi bhi bhartiya kisi dharohar ko god le saktaa he
 Many companies had applied for this and it was decided on the basis of them
 "laal kile main kya karegi company?is yojana ke tahat daalamia group laal kila ko paryatakon ke bich or adhik lokapriy banane ke liye kaam karegaa
 He will also be responsible for its beautification and maintenance
 samjhaute ke tahat group ko chah maheene ke bheetar laal kile main jaruri suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karaani hogi
 This includes app based guides, digital screening, free wifi, digital interactive kiosks, water facilities, tactile map, toilet upgrade, lighting on paths, battery operated vehicles, charging stations, surveillance systems, cafeteria and more
 25 karod kii baat kitni sach?ye baaten bhi charchaa main ain ki paanch saal ke liye daalamia group se 25 karod kii deal hui he
 Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma calls it wrong and says- "I don't know where this figure came from because there is no mention of money in the whole agreement
" 25 karod to dur kii baat he, 25 rupee kya isamen 5 rupee tak kii bhi baat nahin he
 Neither the company will give money to the government nor the government is giving anything to the company
 "kya badalegaa logon ke liye?isapar samskruti mantri kehete hai- imaarat ke kisi hisse ko company chhu nahin sakati he or iske rakrakhaav kaa kaam puri tarah pehle kii tarah puraatatv vibhaag hi karegaa
 The arrangement will remain the same as earlier the archeology department used to give tickets and the facilities for bus tourists will increase
 vahiin company kaa kahana he ki company siesaar inishiative yani korporate saamaajik uttardaayitv nibhaane ke kaam ke jariye inkaa rakrakhaav karne or paryatakon ke liye shauchalay, pine kaa pani, roshni kii vyavastha karne or clockroom aadi banavaane ke liye anumaanit 5 karod prativarsh kharch karegi

 It is the responsibility of ASI to preserve all the heritage of national importance

 unki suraksha kare
 Prevent attempts to harm him in any form, protect him from sabotage
 use hataane, usamen badlaav kii koshishon se sangrakshan pradaan kare
 The constitution makers included Article 49 in the Directive Principles of State Policy and ensured that the preservation and regulation of historical heritage of national importance would be the responsibility of the government
 suvidhaon ke vikaas ke sandarbh main nirdeshaitihaasik dharoharon ke aria ke aasapaas 200 meter tak ke ilaake main kisi bhi tarah ke sanrachanaatmak badlaav ko rokane kaa nirdesh bhi isamen shaamil he
 For the development of facilities near historic heritage, the government may allow some changes in its control but it should not have any impact on the infrastructure of the heritage
 is maamle main supreme court ne bhi samay-samay par sarkaar ko jaruri nirdesh die hai
 In 2010 the National Human Rights Authority came into existence
 iske baad dharoharon ke aasapaas ke 100 meter kii paribhaasha ko punarparibhaashit kiya gaya or ise nirmaan nishedh ilaaka ghoshit kiya gaya
 Apart from this, some changes have also been made in the rules for the development of facilities in the area of 100 to 300 meters, but that can also be possible only according to government control
 kisi bhi aitihaasik imaarat kii mul sanrachana main sirf marammat kaa kaam ho saktaa he uski sanrachana main kisi tarah kaa koi badlaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The control of the historical heritage will be entirely by the government and whoever works there can be under the law and under the supervision of AASI

 (input-ians) The controversy over Navjot Singh Sidhu's swearing-in ceremony at Imran Khan's swearing-in ceremony with Pakistanjane and hugging Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa did not even mean that Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarindarsingh has given a further air to the controversy by bringing a law like Pakistan
 captain amarinder punjab main pakistan kii tarah kaishninda kanoonlekar aae hai, jiske tahat dharmik granthon kii brudabi karne paraumrakedaki sajaa tak mil sakati he
 In fact, on Tuesday, the Punjab cabinet approved a draft bill proposing amendments to the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Criminal Procedure Code (crpc) to punish the convicts for disrespecting religious texts
 isko pakistan ke ishaninda kanoon kii tarah kathor bataaya ja rahaa he
 However, the Amarinder government says that the government has brought this law to curb the incidents of disharmony in the state and to maintain communal harmony

 a Punjab government spokesperson said that the cabinet has approved adding Section 295-AA of the IPC, with the intention of hurting the religious sentiments of the people to hurt or harm the Guru Granth Sahib, Srimad Bhagwat Gita, the Holy Quran and the Holy Bible Or the disrespector could get life imprisonment

 unhone kaha ki cabinet ne kai anya vidheyakon ko vidhansabha ke aagaamee satr main sadan main pesh karne ko bhi manjuuri di he
 It is worth mentioning that in the year 2016 when the Shiromani Akali dal-bjp coalition government was in Punjab, the state assembly passed the CRPC (punjab Amendment) Bill-2016 and IPC (punjab Amendment) Bill-2016
 guru granth sahib ke anadar ke doshiyon ko umrakaid kii sajaa dene ke liye us vakt sanshodhan vidheyak paarit kiya gaya tha
 However, the central government later objected to the amendment, asking the state government that the sentence of life imprisonment should not be limited to insulting the sacred scripture of any one religion, but in the case of insulting scriptures of every religion
 Must be implemented

 Should be lots of fun @starsportsindia # indvsl The Narendra Modi government at the Center has completed four years
 is maukey par sarkaar se uske dwaara kiye gaye kaamkaaj kaa hisaab maanga ja rahaa he to sarkaar bhi apane prachaar tantra ke jariye uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan karne main juty he
 In the midst of the debate on the successes and failures of the government, one thing can be said with the claim that in the last four years, the movement of students in large educational institutions in the country has revolved around national politics
 It has rarely seen in decades
 alag-alag campason main jis tarah kii ghatnaayen huin use dekhakar sawaal uthaa ki chaatr apane adhikaron ke liye lard rahe hai yaa ve vichaardhaara kii ladaai kaa mohara ban gaye hai?modi sarkaar ke in chaar saalon main aise kai maukey aae jab desh ke bade-bade shikshan santhaan ke chaatr-chatraayen sadakon par dikhaai die
 Slogans were raised
 hadtaal hui
 Rallies came out and many times the students were also confronted with the police
 chaatr raajnneeti main vaise to ye aam he lekin is baar chijen isliye thodaa alag thim kyonki modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main andolankaaree chaatro ke nishane par khud piem modi, bijepi or yahaan tak ki aresas bhi rahaa
 This is the reason why BJP got an opportunity to say that the opposition which has been marginalized in the country is now fighting a sporadic war with the government through the campus and students are being made its pawn
 is bare main purv jeenyu chaatr or anuvadak suyash suprabh kehete hai, 'asal main hua yah ki is sarkaar main campason kii swaittata kam hui or chaatro ko praapt adhikaron main jabardast kami hui
 This happened openly and because of this, the section of the students which was hitherto apolitical, connected with politics and became part of the protests by the students
 ’haalanki jeenyu chaatr sangh ke purv joint secretary or abivipi ke sadsy saurabh sharma suyash suprabh ke jawaab se ittefaq nahin rakhte
 After Saurabh formed the Modi government in 2014, there has been a drastic decline in the politics in campuses and there has been an agenda in every battle
 aajtak
 Speaking to in, Saurabh says, 'this is exactly what happened
 aap hyderabad uniwarsity main jo hua use le lijie
 Talk about what happened in JNU
 biechayu or eemyu ko bhi shaamil kar lijie
 All these cases have been politicized
 chaatro kii baat kahin nahin hui
 The real issues were left behind and the matter started with the RSS or Narendra Modi
 is puure trend main jo sabase ahm baat he wo yah ki aisa anjaane main nahin hua
 'if you look at the facts and investigate the events, then both types of cases are found
 jahaan ek taraf sarkaar se jude logon ne campason main padhane vaale chaatr-chaatro ko lekar aapattijanak bayaan die, vahiin campason ke bahaane modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhane kii koshishen bhi huin
 Among the most objectionable statements, the most talked about was a condom statement in BJP MLA Gyandev Dev Ahujaka JNU
 ahuja ne 22 farvari 2016 ko alvar main ek raily main kaha tha, 'jeenyu main rojaanaa sharaab kii 4000 bottlen, cigarette ke 10 hajaar filter, bidi ke 4000 tukade, haddiyon ke chote-bade 50 hajaar tukade, chips ke 2000 reppers or 3000 istemaal kiye gaye condom milte hai
 Like JNU, in September 2017, the Kashi Hindu University (BHU) in Banaras boiled over
 ek chaatra ke saath campus main hui chhedchhad ke baad bhadke chaatra-chaatraon ke gusse kaa taap itnaa tej tha ki garmi dilli tak mahasoos kii gai
 Two-three days after the incident, a team of students from BHU gathered at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 thodi si narebaaji or media ko bite dene ke baad vaktaaon ke bolne kaa daur shuru hua
 One of these names was that of the young Congress leader Shahzad Poonawala
 unhone apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat se aakhir tak puure maamle ke liye centre kii modi sarkaar ko jimmedaar bataaya or bijepi, narendra modi va aresas par hamale kiye
 Overall, if we look at the entire matter in its entirety, both types of cases arise
 aisi koshishen bhi dikhti hai jab campus ke bahaane vipakshi partiyon ne centre kii modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhane kii koshishen kii vahiin aise maamle bhi dikhte hai jo bataate hai ki maujuuda sarkaar main campason kaa khulaapan, vaad-vivaad karne kii vyavastha or sarkaar se sawaal-jawaab karne kii takat par chot hui
 Some major cases related to the campuses - Rohit Vemula, a student at Hyderabad University, committed suicide but all opposition parties, including the Congress, attack the Modi government by calling it an 'institutional murder'
 khud modi ko is mudde par apni chuppi todani padi or vemula kii maa kaa zikr karte hue unhen sabake saamne bhavuk hote dekha gaya
 The picture of Mohammed Ali Jinnah hanging in Aligarh Muslim University's Students' Union office for the last nearly eight decades was made a matter by the local BJP MP and the matter became a matter of national debate, through which polarization was also attempted
 -jamiya milia islamia kaa alpsankhyak darje khatm karne or aligarh muslim univarsity ko ye darja na die jane ke liye sarkaar active hui to uske virodh main chaatr or vipakshi dal lamaband hue
 - When Gajendra Chauhan was made the president of Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) Pune, the students started a movement in protest that the matter was in the headlines for months and its heat was felt till Delhi

 Zakir Naik's relationship with Bihar has come to light
 apane bhadakaau bhaashanon ke jariye muslim naujavaanon kaa brain wash kar unhen aatank ke liye uksaane ke maamle main charchaa main aae nike ne bihar kaa daura bhi kiya tha
 Zakir Naik's strong link with Bihar has now been revealed by the Union Home Ministry in the investigation of agencies, facing new investigation in FCRA case
 suraksha agenciyon ne india today se bataaya ki enie nenike kii kai kitaaben, aalekh or tasviren-posters barmada kii hai
 The agency was stunned by the similar references during the Darbhanga module terror attack in 2011

 During this period, terrorist Faisal Mehmood, who was living in Saudi Arabia, came under the control of security agencies
 librari se chalata tha indian mujahidin kaa oparationdilachasp baat he ki sabhi giraftaareyon main ek librari kaa rishta saamne aayaa tha
 All the terrorists used this library regularly
 darbhanga ke is daar-ul-kitaab sunna librari ke bare main report he kiindian mujahidinke darbhanga modul kaa sanchaalan isi librari se kiya jaataa tha
 The Yasin Bhatkal security agencies used to visit the library constantly, so the articles, books and some related items of Zakir Naik were recovered from it
 agenciyon ne bataaya ki saal 2012 bihar-nepal seemaa par giraftaar indian mujahidin ke founder yaccin bhatkal bhi is librari main lagaataar aata jaataa rahata tha
 Similar books and photographs were also recovered from the suspects arrested after the bombing at the Gandhi rally, Patna rally of Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on behalf of Naik, related to the Gandhi Maidan bomb blast
 kishanganj main nike ne kii thi muslimon kii ralizakir nike ne saal 2012 main bihar ke simavarti jila kishanganj main muslimon kii ek raily bhi yojit kii thi
 Munna Khan, the local ward counselor of Darbhanga said that the NIA team had seized several books and cds during the investigation here
 darbhanga kaa naam aatankwaad se judana durbhagyapurna he
 If the books of Zakir Naik are recovered here, it needs to be investigated in more depth
 sthaneey logon ne kaha- islam ko sharminda karata he nikunhone kaha ki enie team ne jin kitabon ko jabt kiya he unka istemaal muslim naujavaanon kaa brain wash karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 According to Khan, Naik's provocative speeches are intended to incite young people to become jihadis and embarrass Islam as a religion
 mufti ne kiya nike kii kitabon kaa bachaawol india muslim personal board ke sadsy mufti ejaj arshad kaasmi ne librari se jakir nike kii kitaaben baraamad hone kaa bachaav kiya
 He said that there is no restriction on the books of Zakir Naik

 Based on this, the library cannot be sealed by creating doubt

 Pakistan's ISI has become angry after a surgical strike by the Indian Army in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki pakistan kii ye khufia agency bharat main aatanki hamale karvaa kar badla lene kii firaaq main he
 According to the English newspaper Times of India, ISI has told the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed that in any way, to strike in India and avenge the surgical strike
 jaankaree ke anusaar jaish-e-mohammad kaa sargana masood ajahar phir se bhartiya sansad par hamale kii taiyaari kar rahaa he

 bhartiya khufia agency or jammu-kashmir kii siaidi ko jaankaree mili he ki jaish phir se bharat main bade hamale kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 Due to which security forces have been alerted
 bhartiya khufia agenciyon ko mili jaankaree ke mutabitjaish ke fidainhgar sansad par hamalaa karne main naakaam hote hai to wo dilli sachivalay, lotus temple or akshardham mandir par hamalaa kar sakate hai
 According to the information received, if jaish-e-mohammed terrorists are not able to attack any major place, then they can also attack in crowded places

 khufia agenciyon se mil rahi jaankaree ke aadhaar par sansad main lagaataar suraksha kaa jayja liya ja rahaa he
 For Rohit or Rahane, the possibility of playing in the playing eleven is possible only when they are tried in the opening (or wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel) in the event of an opener flop or injury
 chaar gendbaaj ke saath utarana bhi iskaa ek vikalp ho saktaa he, lekin captain kohli ne ab tak paanch gendbaajon ke saath hi utarane kii aakraamak ranneeti apanaai he or iske achche parinaam bhi mili hai

 For example, three fast bowlers can be selected if Team India plays abroad and three spinners in the country
 teen spin gendbaaj khilaae jane kii sthiti main aswin, jadeja kii jagah to pakki he
 There will be a competition between Jayant Yadav / Amit Mishra for the third spinner and Jayant's claim is strong due to his all-rounder performance and age in the series against England
 isi tarah teen tej gendbaaj utaare jane kii sthiti main mo
 Shami and Umesh Yadav are the front runners while Ishant / Bhuvi is likely to compete for another spot
 
 
 bas sankat to rohit or ajinkya par hi he
 
 
 In other words, instead of batting, there is scope for change in bowling as per the mood of the wicket
 masalan team india ke videsh main khilne kii sthiti main teen tej gendbaaj chune ja sakate hai or desh main khilne kii sthiti main teen spinner
 In case of three spin bowlers, Ashwin is sure of replacing Jadeja
 tisare spinner ke liye jayant yadav / amit mishra ke bich hode hogi or england ke khilaaf siries main olerounder pradarshan or umr kam hone ke kaaran jayant kaa daawa majboot he
 Likewise, Moe in case of three fast bowlers

 Now he will have to stay in Tihar Jail till 19 September
 unako jail main vishesh suraksha muhaiyaa karai gai he
 Earlier, immediately after the decision to send him to judicial custody, p Chidambaram's lawyer Kapil Sibal filed a petition in the court asking that Chidambaram be provided security in Tihar Jail too, as he has already got z category security
 haalanki court ne unki is maang ko manjuuri de di he
 What do the rules say? Now the question arises here that if Kapil Sibal did not demand protection of p Chidambaram in jail, would he not be given protection or kept like other ordinary prisoners in jail? Prisons Act-1894, Delhi Prisons Act-2000 and Model Jail Manuals have been made in this regard
 inamen jail main kaidiyon kii suraksha, adhikaron or jail prashasan kii vyavastha ko lekar praavdhaan kiye gaye hai
 According to the Model Jail Manual, separate security arrangements will be made in the jail for under trial prisoners receiving special category protection
 pi chidambaram bhi jed category suraksha praapt under trial kaidi hai
 He has been the Home Minister and Finance Minister of India
 aise main unako vishesh suraksha muhaiyaa karaane kii jimmedaari jail prashasan kii he
 According to the model prison manual, the responsibility of the prisoners is to provide security to all the prisoners
 yah unka moulik adhikaar he
 The Supreme Court has also clearly stated that in no case permission can be given to violate the human rights of prisoners
 kisi bhi kaidi ke saath koi bhi jail kaa karmchaaree durvyavhaar yaa amanviya vyavhaar nahin kar saktaa he
 To do so is a violation of his fundamental rights
 agar kisi kaidi ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan hota he to vah anuchhed 32 ke tahat sidhe supreme court or anuchhed 226 ke tahat sidhe hai court kaa darwaja khatkhata saktaa he
 Now the question arises here, what action can the court take if the fundamental rights of the prisoner are violated in prison? Every prison in the jail is also empowered to get free legal advice
 lihaaja jail main andar trial kaidiyon ko kanoonee madad dene ke liye lau officer niyukt kiye jate hai
 Apart from this, prisoners are also allowed to meet their families and private lawyers
 aise kaidiyon kii taraf se koi doosraa bhi nyaayalay kaa darwaja khatkhata saktaa he
 The security system starts as soon as he goes to jail
 As soon as he steps into the jail, the responsibility of the security system of p Chidambaram has become that of the jail administration
 jail bhejne se pehle kaidi kaa medical test hota he or uski puri talaashi lee jaati he
 During this time all his items are taken and are not allowed inside the prison
 haalanki under trial kisi ko apane khud ke kapade le jane kii ijaajat hoti he
 If a prisoner does not have his own clothes, he is provided with clean clothes by the jail administration
 guuruuvaar raat jab chidambaram tihaad jail pahunche to unako bhi is suraksha jaanch se guzarana padaa

 ) The Congress is now under siege with renewed siege in Gujarat after repairing its party's forks
 gujarat kii siyasat main teen noujvaan is vaqt party ko ahm nazar aa rahe hai, jinako saadhane kii wo koshish main jute gai he
 The party feels that, as far as possible, they can gather the votes of the BJP opposition
 pehla naam-hardik patelsbase pehle congress kii ummid patidaaron ke bade chehre hardik patel hai
 Hardik is currently under 25 years old and cannot contest elections
 lekin wo patidaar samaaj ke bade hisse ko prabhavit karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 That is why the party has started talks with Hardikhan inside
 party sutron ke mutabik, hardik ke saath shuruaati baatcheet safal rahi he or sab kuch isi tarah chalaa to chunaav main hardik congress ke paksh main vot dene kii apil kar sakate hai
 In return, the Congress can give solid assurances to the Patidars on reservation, as well as give tickets to some close to Hardik
 doosraa naam-jigneshiske baad doosraa naam he dalit samaaj se aane vaale jignesh
 The party is also in constant touch with Jignesh
 sutron ke mutabik, jignesh ne bijepi virodh kaa jhanda to buland kar rakhaa he, lekin congress ke tikat par chunaav ladane se bhi inkaar kar diya he
 In such a situation, it is the effort of Congress that Jignesh should support the party from which he contested and in return, Jignesh should raise the voice of BJP opposition
 sutron kii maane, jignesh se bhi kuch siton par congress kii baatcheet sakaaratmak disha main he
 However, the party feels that Jignesh's sphere of influence is not as big as Hardik's
 teesraa naam-alpeshiske baad teesraa naam he alpesh kaa, jo thakor samaaj se aate hai
 The party is also contacting Alpesh
 alpesh kaa prabhaav kshetra bhi simit he, lekin congress unako bhi apane paale main laana chaahati he, lekin abhi tak usko alpesh ke maamle main safalataa nahin mil pai he
 In fact, the Congress feels that after the departure of Shankar Singh Vaghela, it is now making its strategy openly
 saath hi gujarat congress ne alaakaman ko bataa diya he ki,ensipi ab bijepi kii bi team kii tarahakaam kar rahi he, rajyasabha chunaav main bhi usne dhokhaa diya
 In such a situation, BJP will only want the loss of Congress through NCP
 isliye congress ko bina ensipi nai ranneeti ke saath gujarat chunaav main utarana chahie
 Congress wants to turn the youth of Gujarat towards itself, as well as the youth of 18-35 years in Gujarat did not see the rule of Congress, so through these three youth, the Congress wants to turn the youth of Gujarat towards themselves
 isliecongress ab apni is ranneeti ko anjaamtak pahunchane main jor shor se lagi he
 It seems that Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar is on the front line of harming his party
 guuruuvaar ko unhone piem modi ko 'neech insaan' bataa diya
 The campaigning for the assembly elections in Gujarat is at a peak
 lekin isi dauraan rajya ke iskar vibhaag kaa ek tazaa ghatnakram bhi karypalika ke galiyaaron main charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 Read together five big news of Thursday evening
 1- manishankar ayyar kaa bayaan- modi neech insaan, PM bole- mujhe neech jati kaa kahaaisa lagata he ki congress netaa manishankar ayyar apni party ko nuksaan pahunchane ke morche par hai
