 com / Cni9wz5dwg— Nawazuddin Siddiqui (@nawazuddin_s)july 18, 2018 Even though the oil companies decide the price of petrol, the government has the right to tax them
 vahiin petrol par waite lagane se alag-alag rajyon main petrol kii keemton main baari antar dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 In such a situation, you may have to travel to Andaman to buy the cheapest petrol
 petrol kii sabase zyada keemat mumbai main lagbhag 80 rupee ke kareeb he
 At the same time, the price of petrol is the lowest in Andaman
 port blair (andaman nicobar) main petrol kii keemat 60
 80 rupees
 desh main hi petrol kii keemton main in rajyon ke bich 20 rupee prati litre kaa antar he
 The price of petrol in Goa is also close to Rs 65
 anya rajyon ke mukaable north east ke rajyon main petrol or dijal par waite kam he
 In Arunachal, 20 percent on petrol and 12 on diesel
 5 fisadi waite he
 In Tripura, 20 on petrol and 13 on diesel
 5 fisadi waite he
 VAT rates in Meghalaya, Nagaland and Mizoram are also quite low
 isliye in rajyon main petrol or dijal kii keemten duusare rajyon ke mukaable kam hai
 That is why excise duty on interpatrol and diesel is fixed
 jahaan petrol par yah 21
 17 on diesel if Rs 48
 33 rupee he
 The Modi government has increased excise duty on petrol by 126 percent and diesel excise duty by 374 percent since November 2014
 iske baavjood petrol-dijal kii keemat nirdhaaran maamle main asli bhoomika rajyon kii hoti he
 In states where VAT on petrol is high, the price of petrol is the highest
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra, madhya pradesh, punjab or telugana vah rajya hai, jahaan petrol par 35 pratishat tak waite lagata he
 In Kerala, 34 percent VAT is levied
 vahiin rajyon main sabase kam waite kii baat karen to goa main sirf 17 pratishat waite lagata he
 VAT in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Tripura is around 20 percent
 vahiin andaman and nicobar dweep main petrol par centre dwaara sirf 6 pratishat waite dar lagu he
 Think of it like this: Dealer Price 30 on Diesel in Delhi
 19 rupee he, usapar 17
 There is an excise tax of Rs 33
 saath hi 2
 50 is the dealer commission
 aise main lagbhag dilli ke distributors ko dijal ke liye 50 rupee dene padate hai
 At the same time, after the 27 percent VAT, the price of diesel is about 59 rupees
 vahiin dealer depo par 30
 70 after the petrol tax charged at Rs 48 per liter, increasing by about 231 percent
 52 rupee kaa miltaa he
 After the implementation of GST, this change has been suggested by Petroleum Minister, Dharmendra Pradhan, that petrol and diesel should also be GST
 haalanki rajyon ne iskaa virodh kiya he
 This is the reason why GST Council has excluded petrol and diesel from GST
 petrol kii badi keemton par bolte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne vipaksh par isi masale par waar kiya tha
 According to him, in those states where there are Congress and Communist parties, can she take the step of removing VAT from petrol? Jaitley further said that revenue is required to run any country
 aise main agar petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke antargat laayaa gaya to kai rajyon inaki keemton main baari giravat dekhne ko mil sakati he
 At the same time, there will also be a surge in its price in some states
 aise main agar sabase zyada jiesti dar 28 pratishat lage to mumbai main petrol kii keemat prati litre lagbhag 69 rupee baithegi, jo kii vartmaan dar se 10 rupee kam hoga
 At the same time, there will be a jump of Rs 13 in its prices in Andaman
 vahiin sabhi north east rajyon main bhi petrol kii keemat badhegi
 The government is seeing an increase in the VAT paid to the beneficiaries
 yah 2015-16 ke 1
 1 in 2016-17 with an increase of 16 percent as against 42 lakh crores
 66 lakh rupee ho gaya he
 At the same time, there was a 35 percent increase in excise duty
 2015-16 ke 1
 It increased from Rs 78 lakh crore to 2 in 2016-17
 42 lakh karod rupee ho gaya he
 These things are making both the Center and the states happy
 petrol or dijal kii keemat par ek or tark yah diya jaataa he ki jab kai saalon tak tel companiyaan ghate kaa saamana kar rahi thim to ab agar unhen phayda pahunch rahaa he or sarkaar ko bhi aamadani ho rahi he to usamen kya galat he
 25,000 crore between 2002 and 2013 and 3 to oil companies according to the data
 38 lakh karod rupee dijal par ghaataa hua he

 com / ydf7lxvpky Assembly elections are due in Bihar this year, but Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar are in no hurry to merge the old parties of the Janata Parivar
 sutron kii maane to janata parivaar ke bhavishya ko lekar koi bhi bahut aashwast nahin he isliye iskaa vilay talataa ja rahaa he
 When many leaders broke together to put Lalu in a shoe
 
 
 jediu, argedy or congress chunaav se pehle apana abhiyaan alag-alag shuru karne kii taiyaariyaan kar chuki hai
 The JDU lodged a separate protest against the Modi government's land acquisition bill, while Lalu Yadav marched against it to Raj Bhavan
 congress ne modi sarkaar kii nitiyon kaa virodh karne ke liye bodhgaya se champaran tak march kiya
 The three parties did not come together on the same issue, which is not auspicious sign for the merger of Janata Parivar
 jediu, congress or argedy ne loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi se karaari shikast milane ke baad bihar main 10 siton par milakar upachunaav ladaa tha
 Subsequently, in November, JDU and RJD decided to merge
 haalanki nitish or lalu ne yah maanane se inkaar kiya he ki janata parivaar ke vilay kii prakriya patari se utar chuki he
 Lalu said in East Champaran, 'samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav has to take a decision on this merger
 ' guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri modi se dilli mulaakaat karne gaye nitish ne bhi vilay kii raah main koi roda hone se inkaar kiya
 Insiders say the merger process is stuck in the name of the election symbol and the proposed organization
 vilay main doosraa roda mulaayam singh ko bataaya ja rahaa he
 Mulayam does not see any benefit in merging with these parties at the national level as these parties do not have a significant presence in Uttar Pradesh
 vaise, haal main khabaren ai thim ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne bijepi netaaon ve nitish kumaar ke saath gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaen talashne ke liye kaha he
 It is different that Nitish and other JDU leaders have now ruled out any possibility of a re-alliance with the BJP
 raging ko lekar jagah-jagah se aati shikayaton se nipatane ke liye maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne ek nai shuruyaat kii he
 Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar has launched the UGC app to tackle ragging
 yah ap shikayaton ko darj karaane kii prakriya ko aasaan karegaa or iske jariye peedit chaatro ko madad milegi
 This app has been prepared by University Grants Commission UGC, which is named 'anti Ragging Mobile App'
 prakaash jaavdekar kaa maananaa he ki is mobile aplicoshan se chaatro coraging kii samasyase nipatane main madad milegi
 Launching the app, he said that there have been cases of ragging in many colleges, which we have also dealt with from time to time
 lekin aisi shikayaton ko puri tarah se khatm karne kii jarurat he
 Prakash Javadekar says that ragging is mental and physical torture given to new students
 jisko kabhi manjuur nahin kiya jaataa he
 This cannot be allowed, so this app will act as an effective medium for the youth undergoing such an experience
 aise chaatro kaa ek sahaara banegaa
 This app will work on Android system, where such aggrieved students will get their grievance as well as get their settlement immediately
 isse pehle braking kii shikaayat darj karaane ke liye website kaa sahaara lenaa padataa tha
 But this app will reduce such cases
 prakaash jaavdekar ne is maukey par kaha ki jo bhi chaatr raging ke maamle main shaamil honge,unke khilaaf kadi karrwaiki jaaegi
 Such people will not be spared and they will not be allowed to continue studying in the institute
 saath hi kanoon ke mutabik bhi unke khilaaf kadi karrwai karke unhen sajaa di jaaegi
 Prakash Javadekar has also asked senior students to guide their junior students instead of ragging

 The name of Rana ji is very widely used in the songwriters and singers of Uttarakhand
 log unako pyaar se ‘hirdaa kumauni’ naam se bhi pukaarte hai
 Even today people listen to his songs very carefully
 uttarakhand main adhiktar log ab pravasi ho gaye hai or rah-rahakar unhen pradesh kii yaad aati he
 In such a situation, Uttarakhandis feel relaxed after listening to the songs of 'hirda'
 is bich rana ji par kitaab aa jaae, to unke chaahane waalon ke liye yah sone par suhaaga se kam nahin he
 Journalist Charu Tiwari's edited book 'sangharsh Ka Rahi' on 'hirda' takes a close look at his 50-year composition journey

 By reading this book, you can understand the struggle of Rana ji very closely
 is kitaab main rana ji ke vividh prakaar ke geeton kaa sangrah bhi hai
 These diverse genres include patriotism, songs of consciousness, social songs, makeup songs, poems
 bahut kam log ye jaanate hai ki ranaji ne swatantraaa sangram par naatak bhi likhaa he
 Kumaoni has used words very well in the book, which is why this book will be liked by the people of Pahar (uttarakhand)
 itani hi nahin isamen likhane vaale log kisi naa kisi rup main rana ji se parichit hai
 This is the reason why this book looks closely at many aspects of Rana ji
 phir chaahe rana ji ke paariwarik sthiti ho yaa aarthik sthiti yaa phir unke jivan ke shuruyaat lamhe jab unhone geeton ko gaanaa or likhnaa shuru kiya
 Excerpts from the book
 
 
 shaayad hi koi aisa ho jo rana ji ke geeton se parichit naa ho
 But not everyone should know about their love for mountain, family life-struggle
 kitaab main vichaar vyakt karne vaala har koi lekhak, patrkaar, kahanikar unke geeton kaa zikr jarur karte hai
 Among the songs that he mentions are ‘today we hill hill han riwari

 , In Mankhon Padyouv
 
 
 , aalily bakirin lily
 
 
 , My friend, i am yours

 Karunanidhi's death has not passed even a week now that his party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), has started meeting the controversy over the legacy
 party se nishkasit or karunanidhi ke bade bete emke alaagiri ne daawa kiya he ki pita ke sachche samarthak or sahyogi unke saath hai
 Alagiri's statement came just before the DMK executive committee meeting
 chennai main anna memorial par apane pita ko shrridhanjali dene ke baad alaagiri ne kaha ki kaliner (em
 Karunanidhi) 's true supporters are with me and they are in support of me
 bhavishya kii raajnneetik yojana par unhone kaha ki yah vakt batayega

 'bataa den ki diemke kii raajnneetik viraasat ko lekar donon bhaaiyon ke bich purana vivaad rahaa he
 In fact, in 2016, Karunanidhi declared his younger son MK Stalin as his political heir
 isse pehle hi 2014 main party virdohi gatividhiyon ke liye emke alaagiri ko nishkasit kar diya gaya tha
 Alagiri was accused of working against the party line
 saath hi unhone ye bhi kaha ki stallin teen maheene ke andar mar jaaenge
 So now that the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are close and the politics of Tamil Nadu has already seen ups and downs after the death of AIADMK Chief Jayalalithaa, Karunanidhi's departure could pose a crisis for the DMK
 yahi vajah he ki emke alaagiri kaa yah bayaan kaaphi ahm mana ja rahaa he

 The Congress has accused Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan of misleading the Assembly
 vyaapman ghotaale ko lekar puche gaye sawaalon ke jabaav main shivaraj ne galat jaankariyaan di
 The Congress, by presenting some documents, accused Shivraj of doing everything possible to suppress the Vyapam scam
 31 march 2011 ko vidhansabha main shivaraj singh chouhan se poocha gaya ki vyaapman kii jaanch ke liye gathit samiti ne ab tak kitne farzi abhyaarthiyon kii pahchaan kii gai he? jawaab main mukhyamantri ne kaha ki aaj ke dinaank tak kisi bhi farzi abhyaarthee kii pahchaan nahin kii gai he
 But in the FIR filed on 19 November 2009, 40 fake candidates had been nominated
 isi tarah 23 farvari 2012 ko shivaraj ne vidhansabha ko bataaya ki medical chaatro ke dastauez or photo kii jaanch ke liye central forencik leboratory hyderabad ko bheja gaya he
 While whistleblower Ashish Chaturvedi was told by RTI Hyderabad Laboratory that no such case came to him for investigation
 chandigarh leboratory ne bhi aisa hi jawaab diya
 Congress media cell chairman Randeep Surjewala said that Shivraj Singh Chauhan tried his best to save everyone
 vidhansabha main jhooth bolaa
 It is also a matter of defamation of the Legislative Assembly
 tippaniyan Shivraj has been claiming that he exposed the Vyapam scam
 lekin ab ve is mudde par ghir gaye hai
 Digvijay Singh is alleging that BJP and RSS are compelled to save Shivraj
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh chutki lete hue kehete hai ki bijepi-aresas ko dar he ki shivaraj par karrwai hui to ve unki pole khol denge
 The Supreme Court has handed over the investigation of the Vyapam scam to the CBI but is seeking removal of Shivraj citing his track record
 randeep surajevaala pradhanmantri se shivaraj ko barkhaast karne kii maang karte hue kehete hai ki jab tak shivaraj ko hataaya nahin jaataa or supreme court nigaraanee nahin karti tab tak nishpaksh jaanch sambhav nahin
 On 31 March 2011, Shivraj Singh Chauhan was asked in the Legislative Assembly that how many fake candidates have been identified by the committee set up to investigate the business
 In response, the Chief Minister said that no fake candidates have been identified till date
 lekin 19 november 2009 ko darj kii gai exiaar main 40 farzi abhyaarthiyon ko namjad kiya ja chukaa tha
 Similarly, on 23 February 2012, Shivraj told the Assembly that documents and photographs of medical students have been sent to Central Forensic Laboratory Hyderabad for examination
 jabaki vislabloar ashish chaturvedi ko artiai main hyderabad leboratory ne bataaya ki uske paas aisa koi maamla jaanch ke liye aayaa hi nahin
 The Chandigarh Laboratory gave a similar reply
 congress media cell ke chairman randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki shivaraj singh chouhan ne har kisi ko bachaane kii puri koshish kii
 Lied in assembly
 ye vidhansabha kii manahani kaa bhi maamla he
 The comments shivaraj daawa karte rahe hai ki vyaapman ghotaale ko unhone hi ujagar kiya
 But now they are surrounded by this issue
 digvijay singh aarope laga rahe hai ki shivaraj ko bachaana bijepi or aresas kii majaburi he
 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh quips that BJP-RSS is afraid that if action is taken on Shivraj, he will open his pole
 supreme court ne vyaapman ghotaale kii jaanch sibiai ko saunp di he lekin shivaraj ke trek record kaa hawala dete hue unako hataae jane kii maang kar rahi he
 Randeep Surjewala demands the Prime Minister to sack Shivraj, saying that impartial inquiry is not possible until Shivraj is removed and the Supreme Court supervises
 isi tarah 23 farvari 2012 ko shivaraj ne vidhansabha ko bataaya ki medical chaatro ke dastauez or photo kii jaanch ke liye central forencik leboratory hyderabad ko bheja gaya he

 There is news of fire in the forests of Ardhkumari of Mata Vaishno Devi temple in Katra, Jammu
 shrin board or van vibhaag ke karmchaaree aag bujhane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 The fire has not made any difference to the trip, the journey still continues
 abhi tak aag lagane se kisi tarah ke nuksaan kii koi khabar nahin he
 The Jambajs of India proved in the Kargil war that no matter what the situation is, if someone even raised an eye towards our borders, the consequences would be bad
 lambey arase tak hui golibariindian army or airforce ke jabanjon ne tamaam mushkilon ke baavjood 17 hajaar feet oonche jang ke maidan main wo rankaushal dikhaaya ki duniya dang rah gai
 More than 300 cannons of the Indian Army thundered at the enemies day and night
 boforce 155 mem medium ganon or 105 mem indian field ganon ne kareeb dhai lakh gole or rocket daage
 After the Second World War, the world had not seen such tremendous firepower for such a long time
 kam nahin tha khatrindian airforce ke miraj-2000, mig-23 or mig-27 ladaaku vimaan bhi aasmaan se kahar ban kar dushmano par tuutate rahe
 But targeting enemies hidden in the mountains at a height of 17 thousand feet was a very dangerous task
 khaskar tab jabaki pakistani ghuspaithiye stinger mixilon se las hokar 17 hajaar foot kii oonchai par banksron main baithe the
 Kargil's war will be remembered as a glorious success of the Indian army, but we cannot forget this victory because the victory of 527 Jambajo and the unmatched bravery of thousands of soldiers
 rajasthan main kul 200 siten hai, isamen se 199 siton par chunaav hue the
 Voting could not be held on 1 seat due to the death of a candidate
 taaja aankadon ke mutabik congress or uske saathi 98 siton par aage hai
 At the same time, BJP is leading in 75 seats
 rajasthan main 26 siton par nirdaleey or choti partiyon ke ummidavaar aage hai jisase tay he ki bhaajapa se naaraazgi vaale saare vot congress ko transfar nahin hue hai
 If that were the case, the Congress could get a strong majority
 doosraa, aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki rajasthan main bhaajapa kaa supada saaf ho jayega, vaisaa bhi hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 Looking at the trends, it seems that if the party had supported Vasundhara, the picture would have been a bit better
 modi apni jansabhaon main congress, rahul, neem coted uria kii baat karte rahe, lekin vasundhara kaa naam lene se bachate rahe
 Amit Shah had told from the filled stage that Vasundhara you have worked, but could not tell your work
 rajasthan main congress ko siten bhale hi zyada milti dikh rahi hon, lekin donon ke vot pratishat main maamuli antar he
 39 to Congress
 2 fisadi mat mili hai vahiin bhaajapa ko 38
 Got 8% votes
 to phir bhaajapa kii sambhavit haar kii vajahen kya rahi hai?vasundhara raaje or bhaajapa ne rajasthan main pichley chaar saal main apane vot bank (jat, gurjar or rajput) ko har tarah se dularkar rakhane kii koshish kii
 But these three castes (which make up about 20 per cent of Rajasthan's population and which have an impact in neighboring states of Haryana and Madhya Pradesh) are angry with the BJP
 sachin payalat ke aane se gurjar samudaay bhi bhaajapa se dur ho rahaa he
 Jat: The Jats have an impact on 100 assembly seats in the state, including the Marwar region
 yah samudaay bhaajapa se gussa he, kyonki party main inaki koi khaas jagah nahin he
 Being a farmer, the agricultural crisis is also a reason
 rajputon ke mukaable kam tavajjo milane se bhi is samudaay main naaraazgi thi
 Rajput: This community has generally been loyal to the BJP
 har vidhansabha main 15-17 rajput bhaajapa ke tikat par vidhayak banate rahe hai
 In 2013, 24 of the total 27 Rajput mlas were from BJP
 par is jati main bechaini he kyonki rajput netaaon ke khilaaf mukademe kiye gaye
 There is anger in the community even after the death of gangster Anandpal in the encounter and Karni Sena is angry with the government after the Padmavat issue
 jaaton ke saath rajputon kaa sangharsh bhi chal rahaa he
 Neglect of senior BJP leader Jaswant Singh and Manvendra Singh joining Congress is also a big factor
 rajput samudaay kareeb 100 vidhansabha siton par maujuud he
 Gurjar: This community has presence in 50 seats
 aarakshan ke mudde par gujars bhaajapa se naaraaz the
 More than 70 Gujars have been killed since 2007 in police firing and mutual fighting
 sachin payalat ko bhavi mukhyamantri ke rup main sambhaavna se congress kii taraf inkaa chunaav abhiyaan main jhukaav badhata dekha gaya tha
 All these factors have proved to be sabotage in bjp's prospects
 chunavi lihaaj se rajasthan ko mote taur paanch kshetron main baanta jaataa he
 Jaipur is one of them
 is kshetra main 19 siten hai jinamein shaam 6 baje tak ke rujhaanon ke mutabik, bhaajapa ke paas 6, congress ke paas 11 or anya ke paas 2 siten jaati dikh rahi hai
 The second electoral area is also three areas in central Rajasthan
 dhundhad ilaake main ajmer, savai madhopur, karauli, tonk or dausa 5 jile hai
 Meena factor is dominant in this area
 aisa mana jaataa he ki meenaon kaa jhukaav bhaajapa kii taraf tha lekin is ilaake main bhaajapa ko 8, congress ko 13 or anya ko 3 siton par badhat / jeet hasil hui he
 In such a situation, the figures tell a different story
 madhya rajasthan ke matsyanchal main 3 jile hai, bharatpur, alvar or dhaulpur
 It has 22 seats
 yah ilaaka sampradayik dhruvikaran kaa ilaaka he
 Meena Factor also works here
 phir bhi, yahaan bhaajapa 4, congress 10 or anya 7 siton par aage he
 So this means that the temple issue did not run here
 tisare kshetra hadoti main 4 jile hai, jinamein koti bundi baaraan or jhalawad hai
 It has 17 seats and 13 seats in direct contest of Congress vs BJP, 4 seats have been in multi-cornered contest
 lekin bhaajapa 9 or congress 8 siton par jitati dikh rahi he
 That is, the remaining parties have not achieved much
 teesraa chunavi ilaaka, dakshini rajasthan he, jise mewar bhi kaha jaataa he
 This region changes the mandate every five years
 mana jaataa he ki jo party mewar jeet leti he vahi sarkaar banaati he
 Especially the Salumbar seat is special because the party that wins this seat has been formed since 1977
 mewar main 7 jile hai or 35 siten hai
 Among these are the areas of Udaipur, Dungarpur, Bhilwara, Rajsamand, Chittorgarh, Pratapgarh, Banswara
 yahaan 27 siton par sidhi takkar thi
 Bhilwara is the area of influence of CP Joshi
 2009 main yahaan bhaajapa 9 or congress 24 siton par jiti thi
 But this time BJP is seen winning 19, Congress 13, other 3 seats
 pashchimi rajasthan kaa ilaaka congress ke diggaj netaa ashok gahalot kaa he
 There is no existence of any third political party here
 kul 43 siten is ilaake main hai jinamein se 33 siton par sidhi takkar thi
 The OBC and Jat votes are highly decisive in this area
 iske alaava meghavaal, raajpurohit or rajputon kaa vot bhi ahm hota he
 Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Nagaur, Jalore, Pali and Sirohi districts fall under this area
 2008 main bhaajapa ko 19 or congress ko 20 siten mili thim
 Others had 4 seats
 lekin is baar 2018 main bhaajapa ko 15, congress ko 26 or anya ko 3 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 Shekhawati and Bikaner are the two zones in northern Rajasthan
 shekhavati main sikar, jhunjhanun or churu jile hai jinamein 21 siten hai
 In this zone, Congress seems to get 14 seats, BJP 5 and others 2 seats
 bikaner jone main bikaner, ganganagar or hanumangarh jilon main kul 18 siten hai
 Here the BJP is getting 9 seats, Congress 6 and others 2 seats
 is ilaake ke jat votbank kaa congress kii taraf jhukaav tha jabaki rajput amuman bhaajapa ko vot karte rahe he
 By the way, the debate in Rajasthan now is whether Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot will become or Sachin Pilot, but according to Congress insiders, only Gehlot, who is known as a magician, can be given a command in view of the number of seats

 There has been some change in the lives of people who travel alone due to increasing selfie trend
 yahaan jaaniye selfi se hone vaale phaayde ke bare main or agali baar selfi lete vakt garv se kahie,' i luun kya selfi'
 1
 aatm nirbhar:jo log tasveeron ke liye dusron kaa munh takate rahete hai, unke liye selfi vardaan banakar aayaa he
 Now where ever i like, picked up the phone and took a selfie
 khud kii tasviir ke liye ab selfi lene vaale log aatmanirbhar ho gaye hai
 a selfie gives the power to smile at a person standing alone in a crowd
 aise maahaul main jahaan jhund main khadey log munh phulae khadey rahete hai, selfi lene vaala shaks apane daant chiyaarte rahata he
 2
 delaar ko chunauti:poonjivadi vyavastha ko chunauti dete hue selfi trend aane se ab tasviir ke liye kisi bade delaar camere kii jarurat nahin hi padati
 Because the selfie is in such a trend that DSLR cameras now seem heavy and boring at times
 jameendaar kii tarah delaar latakaae gum rahe logon ke liye selfi photographers chunauti kii tarah hai
 3
 ham saath-saath hai:kisi bhi puraani group photo ko uthaakar dekh lijie
 One person was always outside

 In Gruffy, everyone now appears in the same picture
 4
 Shotgun medicines in the face of friends: Such friendly enemies who give you a shot for every plan to roam and believe in postponing every plan
 aise logon ko ab kisi bhi lallantaap jagah main jaakar selfi khinchakar bhej dijie yaa fasebuk par post kar dijie
 The next time your partner smokes in Malal's fire, he will not shoot you for any plan
 5
 Wearing selfies: Taking selfies, from nose hair to upper lips, slant mustache and girls have started showing hair on their faces
 is vajah se selfi ko lete hi logon ko yah khyaal aa hi jaataa he ki i sakhi, selfi baad main luungi, pehle khud ko sanvaar luun
 6
 kasarat:tarjani se lekar anguuthe or munh tak, har jagah selfi kaa aitihaasik yogadan he
 These parts have also been exercised due to selfies
 tasviir bhi khinch jaati he or anguuthe or munh bhi chaukas kaam karte rahete hai
 7
 gande daant dikhne lage:gutkha khaaie yaa na khaaie
 Everyone's teeth often get dirty
 selfi lete vakt logon ko apane gande daant dikhne lagate hai, uske baad shuru hota he svachh mukh danta abhiyaan
 Selfies have also played a big role in cleaning dirty teeth
 8
 Eliminate the need for glass: No more glass is needed to behold your face
 selfi se ab tasviir lete vakt khud ko ji bharkar dekhne kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 This also saves time and gives reason to decorate
 9
 Hides Weight Selfie: Selfie helps hide weight
 angel badalakar chehre ko pout se lekar falaan-falaan mod main le jaakar khud ke motaape ko chhipaane main selfi madadgaar hoti he
 Such selfie presents zero figure by hiding your fat in people, just have to try a little friend
 10
 Perfect Pose Photographer: People who used to understand the meaning of the picture as just flashing after the birth of selfie, now such people have started understanding the importance of light and photo sense

 Life ceases as soon as the lightning strikes, because the cooler-ac, the shielding lights from the heat, the shining malls to the factories producing the goods, are all electric games
 
 
 lekin bijli to tab mil paaegi, jab banegi
 
 
 Why is this
 
 
 darasal, desh kii do-tihaai bijli koyale se banati he, lekin jab power plants ke paas koyala hi nahin hoga to ve kya karenge
 
 
 Therefore, many of these have been closed, and some are on the verge of closure
 
 
 desh ke 89 chune hue ahm power plants kii monitoring karne vaali central electricity athurity kii vah report hilaa dene vaali he, jiske mutabik is saal 19 june tak ke aankade bataate hai ki desh ke 23 power plants ke paas ab chaar din se bhi kam ke liye koyale kaa stock bachaa he
 
 
 In addition, 33 other power plants have less than seven days of coal stock
 
 
 so, iskaa matlab hua ki desh ke 56 bade power plants ko ek hafte chalaane ke liye bhi jaruri koyale kaa jugad nahin he
 
 
 In a special conversation with NDTV on this issue, Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal admitted that there is a shortage of coal, but he mainly considers the power companies responsible for this
 
 
 unhone kaha, bahut saare plant itane puraane hai ki vah zarurat se 25 fisadi zyada koyala kha rahe hai, or bahut-se plants ko 20 fisadi aaayaatit koyale kaa istemaal karnaa tha, lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya, kyonki unhen yahaan sasta koyala mil rahaa he, or ve isi se kaam chalaanaa chaahate hai
 
 
 Due to these plants there is a shortage of coal, but no one explains its shortage
 
 
 khaas baat yah he ki pehle power companiyaan stock main jahaan kam se kam teen hafte kaa intjaam rakhti thim, vahiin halaat ab bad se badtar ho chuke hai
 
 
 The news of these things to the common people comes when the power shortage and load shedding in the big cities in the form of heavy heat is encountered during the summer
 
 
 pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajyamantri ve narayansami ne bhi enditivi se baatcheet main kabool kiya ki bijli kii demand−supplai kaa fus ud gaya he
 
 
 He said, demand has increased a lot, and the demand-supply gap is being rectified
 
 
 piem ne pradhan sachiv kii adhyakshata main cameti gathit kii he, or sarkaar koshish kar rahi he
 
 
 Although the PMO has interfered several times in the last few months, the lack of coal cannot be lost by turning the magic wand
 
 
 or parinamswaroop koyale kii killat se juujhati companiyaan jarurat bhar bijli paidaa karne main naakaam rahi hai
 
 
 According to Ashok Khurana, DG of the Association of Power Producers, coal has a total generating capacity of 1,02,000 MW, but 30,000 to 35,000 MW is badly affected
 
 
 yani 30 se zyada plants ko koyala mil hi nahin paa rahaa he
 
 
 However, there is another aspect of this, in which the most important question arises as to why the closure of the closed power plant, and why they are not getting coal
 
 
 central electricity athurity ke mutabik aaj halaat itane kharaab ho chuke hai ki koyale kii kami kii vajah se 37,092 megawatt bijli kam ban rahi he, kyonki na sirf kai plant band ho chuke hai, balki nae plant banaakar bijli kii badhati kami ko puraa karne kii sarkaar kii yojana bhi khatai main pad chuki he
 
 
 Actually, the truth came to light in a special conversation of NDTV with Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal, when he said, it takes four to six years for any coal mine, only to get clearance, and then the coal block becomes operative
 
 
 association of power producers ke diji ashok khurana ke mutabik koyale kii kami kii vajah se varsh 2009 ke baad shuru kiye gaye plants - jaise dilli kaa aravali plant, rajdhani ke nazadik hi bane jhajjar or yamunanagar plants - ko band karnaa padaa he
 
 
 
 
 
 to kya iske liye sarkaar kii faisle na lene kii niti jimmedaar he, jise policy paralysis kaha ja rahaa he
 
 
 This question is also important because coal did not reach the plants because the work could not start due to legal hurdles in the new coal mines
 
 
 koyala mantralay ke mutabik, is saal april ke ant tak kol india limited ke 15 prastaav paryaavaran mantralay or rajya sarkaron kii manzuri main deree kii vajah se atake hue the, paryaavaran clearence na milane kii vajah se kul 48 koyala khadaanon ke prastaav latake pade the, or forestry clearence na milane kii vajah se 180 koyala khadaanon ke prastaav par aage badhanaa mushkil ho rahaa tha
 
 
 Now the CAG investigation has also completed the task
 
 
 kol blox ke aavanton main ghotaale ke aarope ke baad sarkari adhikari faisle lene se ghabara rahe hai
 
 
 Law Minister Salman Khurshid said in a conversation with NDTV, on one hand it is said that you are taking decisions in haste, while on the other hand it is alleged that you are not taking the decision
 
 
 tippaniyan Now after the government's failure to provide the necessary coal, the demand for importing coal from abroad has started to arise
 
 
 power companiyaan daleel de rahi hai ki maujuuda paristhiti main desh main maujuuda sansadhano ke jariye kami ko dur karnaa sambhav nahin he, isliye sarkaar ko balk emport karne ke bare main gambhirtha se sochna chahie, kyonki nijee power companiyon ke liye khud koyala aayaat karnaa behad mahangaa sauda sabit hoga
 
 
 According to Ashok Khurana, the PMO is trying, but it will have to take effective steps very soon, because it takes up to three years for coal to be prepared, so for that time, the coal needs to be imported
 
 
 lekin koyala aayaat karne ke vikalp par agar sarkaar aage badhati he to isse maujuuda dar par bijli supplai karnaa mushkil hoga, kyonki videsh se aane vaala koyala mahangaa hoga
 
 
 So, in such a situation, making the electricity bill of the common man more expensive is an option
 
 
 aisa kyon he
 
 
 Actually, two-thirds of the country's electricity is made of coal, but what will they do when power plants do not have coal
 
 
 isiilie, inamen se kai band ho chuke hai, or kuch band hone kii kagaar par hai
 
 
 The report of the Central Electricity Authority, which monitors 89 selected key power plants in the country, is shocking, according to which figures as of June 19 this year show that 23 power plants in the country now have less than four days Coal stock is left
 
 
 iske alaava 33 anya power plants ke paas saat din se kam koyale kaa stock bachaa he
 
 
 So, this means that even 56 big power plants of the country do not have the necessary coal to run a week
 
 
 is mudde par enditivi se khaas baatcheet main koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal ne mana ki koyale kii kami he, lekin vah iske liye mukhya taur par power companiyon ko hi zimmedaar maanate hai
 
 
 He said, many plants are so old that they are consuming 25 percent more coal than necessary, and many plants had to use 20 percent imported coal, but they did not do so, because they are getting cheaper coal here
 , And they want to run from it
 
 
 inhen plants kii vajah se koyale kii kami he, lekin koi apni kami nahin bataata he
 
 
 The special thing is that earlier where power companies used to keep in stock for at least three weeks, the situation has become worse from now on
 
 
 in baton kii khabar aam logon ko tab lagati he, jab bade-chote shaharon main garmiyon ke dauraan power cat or lod sheding ke rup main bijli kii baari killat saamne aati he
 
 
 In the Prime Minister's Office, Minister of State v Narayanasamy also confessed in conversation with NDTV that the demand-supply fuse of electricity has blown
 
 
 unhone kaha, demand bahut bad gai he, or demand−supplai ke gap ko thik kiya ja rahaa he
 
 
 The PM has constituted a committee headed by the Principal Secretary, and the government is trying
 
 
 haalanki beete kuch maheenon main piemo ne kai baar dakhsandaji kii he, lekin koyale kii kami kaa marz jaadu kii chadi ghumaakar chhomantar nahin ho saktaa
 
 
 And as a result, companies facing coal shortage have failed to generate electricity as needed
 
 
 association of power producers ke diji ashok khurana kehete hai, koyale se kul 1,02,000 megawatt bijli kii paidaa karne kii kshamta he, lekin 30,000 se 35,000 megawatt buree tarah prabhavit he
 
 
 That is, more than 30 plants are not getting coal
 
 
 vaise iskaa doosraa pahalu bhi he, jisamen sabase mahatvapurn sawaal ubharta he ki band power plant ke band hone kii naubat kyon ai, or unhen koyala kyunnahin mil rahaa he
 
 
 According to the Central Electricity Authority, today the situation has become so bad that 37,092 MW of power is being reduced due to coal shortage, because not only many plants have been shut down, but the government is trying to meet the increasing power shortage by creating new plants
 The plan of the project is also in a mess
 
 
 darasal, sachai saamne ai koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal se enditivi kii khaas baatcheet main, jab unhone kaha, kisi bhi kol mine ko chaar se chah saal lag jate hai, clearence milane main hi, or phir kahin jaakar kol blaak oparative ho paata he
 
 
 According to DG Ashok Khurana of the Association of Power Producers, due to coal shortage, the plants started after 2009 - Aravali plant of Delhi, Jhajjar and Yamunanagar plants near the capital - have to be closed
 
 
 
 
 
 So is the government's decision-making policy responsible for this, which is being called policy paralysis
 
 
 yah sawaal isliye bhi ahm he ki planton tak koyala isliye nahin pahunchaa, kyonki nai koyala khadaanon main kanoonee adchanon kii vajah se kaam shuru nahin ho sakaa
 
 
 According to the Coal Ministry, by the end of April this year, 15 proposals of Coal India Limited were stuck due to delay in the approval of the Ministry of Environment and State Governments, a total of 48 coal mines were rejected due to non-clearance of environment clearance
 And because of lack of forest clearance, it was difficult to move forward on the proposal of 180 coal mines
 
 
 ab sieji kii jaanch ne rahi−sahi kasar bhi puri kar di
 
 
 Government officials are nervous about taking decisions after allegations of scam in allocation of coal blocks
 
 
 kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid ne enditivi se baatcheet main kaha, ek taraf kaha jaataa he ki aap jaldbaazi main faisle le rahe hai, vahiin yah bhi aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki aap nirnay nahin le paa rahe hai
 
 
 The comments ab zaruri koyala muhaiyaa karaane main sarkaar kii naakaami ke baad videsh se koyala aayaat karne kii maang uthne lagi he
 
 
 Power companies are arguing that in the current situation it is not possible to overcome the shortage in the country through the existing resources, so the government should think seriously about importing bulk, because it is very expensive for private power companies to import coal themselves
 The deal will be proved
 
 
 ashok khurana ke mutabik piemo koshish kar rahaa he, lekin use bahut jald kargar kadam uthaane honge, kyonki koyala banane main, taiyaar hone main teen saal tak lag jate hai, isliye us samay tak kii zarurat ke liye koyale kaa aayaat to karnaa hi padegaa
 
 
 But if the government goes ahead on the option of importing coal, it will be difficult to supply electricity at the current rate, because coal coming from abroad will be expensive
 
 
 to kya aise main aam aadmi kaa bijli bill or mahangaa karnaa ek vikalp he
 
 
 The report of the Central Electricity Authority, which monitors 89 selected key power plants in the country, is shocking, according to which figures as of June 19 this year show that 23 power plants in the country now have less than four days Coal stock is left
 
 
 iske alaava 33 anya power plants ke paas saat din se kam koyale kaa stock bachaa he

 yah sawaal isliye bhi ahm he ki planton tak koyala isliye nahin pahunchaa, kyonki nai koyala khadaanon main kanoonee adchanon kii vajah se kaam shuru nahin ho sakaa
 
 
 According to the Coal Ministry, by the end of April this year, 15 proposals of Coal India Limited were stuck due to delay in the approval of the Ministry of Environment and State Governments, a total of 48 coal mines were rejected due to non-clearance of environment clearance
 And because of lack of forest clearance, it was difficult to move forward on the proposal of 180 coal mines
 
 
 ab sieji kii jaanch ne rahi−sahi kasar bhi puri kar di
 
 
 Government officials are nervous about taking decisions after allegations of scam in allocation of coal blocks
 
 
 kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid ne enditivi se baatcheet main kaha, ek taraf kaha jaataa he ki aap jaldbaazi main faisle le rahe hai, vahiin yah bhi aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki aap nirnay nahin le paa rahe hai
 
 
 The comments ab zaruri koyala muhaiyaa karaane main sarkaar kii naakaami ke baad videsh se koyala aayaat karne kii maang uthne lagi he
 
 
 Power companies are arguing that in the current situation it is not possible to overcome the shortage in the country through the existing resources, so the government should think seriously about importing bulk, because it is very expensive for private power companies to import coal themselves
 The deal will be proved
 
 
 ashok khurana ke mutabik piemo koshish kar rahaa he, lekin use bahut jald kargar kadam uthaane honge, kyonki koyala banane main, taiyaar hone main teen saal tak lag jate hai, isliye us samay tak kii zarurat ke liye koyale kaa aayaat to karnaa hi padegaa
 
 
 But if the government goes ahead on the option of importing coal, it will be difficult to supply electricity at the current rate, because coal coming from abroad will be expensive
 
 
 to kya aise main aam aadmi kaa bijli bill or mahangaa karnaa ek vikalp he
 
 
 In a special conversation with NDTV on this issue, Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal admitted that there is a shortage of coal, but he mainly considers the power companies responsible for this
 
 
 unhone kaha, bahut saare plant itane puraane hai ki vah zarurat se 25 fisadi zyada koyala kha rahe hai, or bahut-se plants ko 20 fisadi aaayaatit koyale kaa istemaal karnaa tha, lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya, kyonki unhen yahaan sasta koyala mil rahaa he, or ve isi se kaam chalaanaa chaahate hai
 
 
 Due to these plants there is a shortage of coal, but no one explains its shortage
 
 
 khaas baat yah he ki pehle power companiyaan stock main jahaan kam se kam teen hafte kaa intjaam rakhti thim, vahiin halaat ab bad se badtar ho chuke hai
 
 
 The news of these things to the common people comes when the power shortage and load shedding in the big cities in the form of heavy heat is encountered during the summer
 
 
 pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajyamantri ve narayansami ne bhi enditivi se baatcheet main kabool kiya ki bijli kii demand−supplai kaa fus ud gaya he
 
 
 He said, demand has increased a lot, and the demand-supply gap is being rectified
 
 
 piem ne pradhan sachiv kii adhyakshata main cameti gathit kii he, or sarkaar koshish kar rahi he
 
 
 Although the PMO has interfered several times in the last few months, the lack of coal cannot be lost by turning the magic wand
 
 
 or parinamswaroop koyale kii killat se juujhati companiyaan jarurat bhar bijli paidaa karne main naakaam rahi hai
 
 
 According to Ashok Khurana, DG of the Association of Power Producers, coal has a total generating capacity of 1,02,000 MW, but 30,000 to 35,000 MW is badly affected
 
 
 yani 30 se zyada plants ko koyala mil hi nahin paa rahaa he
 
 
 However, there is another aspect of this, in which the most important question arises as to why the closure of the closed power plant, and why they are not getting coal
 
 
 central electricity athurity ke mutabik aaj halaat itane kharaab ho chuke hai ki koyale kii kami kii vajah se 37,092 megawatt bijli kam ban rahi he, kyonki na sirf kai plant band ho chuke hai, balki nae plant banaakar bijli kii badhati kami ko puraa karne kii sarkaar kii yojana bhi khatai main pad chuki he
 
 
 Actually, the truth came to light in a special conversation of NDTV with Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal, when he said, it takes four to six years for any coal mine, only to get clearance, and then the coal block becomes operative
 
 
 association of power producers ke diji ashok khurana ke mutabik koyale kii kami kii vajah se varsh 2009 ke baad shuru kiye gaye plants - jaise dilli kaa aravali plant, rajdhani ke nazadik hi bane jhajjar or yamunanagar plants - ko band karnaa padaa he
 
 
 
 
 
 to kya iske liye sarkaar kii faisle na lene kii niti jimmedaar he, jise policy paralysis kaha ja rahaa he
 
 
 This question is also important because coal did not reach the plants because the work could not start due to legal hurdles in the new coal mines
 
 
 koyala mantralay ke mutabik, is saal april ke ant tak kol india limited ke 15 prastaav paryaavaran mantralay or rajya sarkaron kii manzuri main deree kii vajah se atake hue the, paryaavaran clearence na milane kii vajah se kul 48 koyala khadaanon ke prastaav latake pade the, or forestry clearence na milane kii vajah se 180 koyala khadaanon ke prastaav par aage badhanaa mushkil ho rahaa tha
 
 
 Now the CAG investigation has also completed the task
 
 
 kol blox ke aavanton main ghotaale ke aarope ke baad sarkari adhikari faisle lene se ghabara rahe hai
 
 
 Law Minister Salman Khurshid said in a conversation with NDTV, on one hand it is said that you are taking decisions in haste, while on the other hand it is alleged that you are not taking the decision
 
 
 tippaniyan Now after the government's failure to provide the necessary coal, the demand for importing coal from abroad has started to arise
 
 
 power companiyaan daleel de rahi hai ki maujuuda paristhiti main desh main maujuuda sansadhano ke jariye kami ko dur karnaa sambhav nahin he, isliye sarkaar ko balk emport karne ke bare main gambhirtha se sochna chahie, kyonki nijee power companiyon ke liye khud koyala aayaat karnaa behad mahangaa sauda sabit hoga
 
 
 According to Ashok Khurana, the PMO is trying, but it will have to take effective steps very soon, because it takes up to three years for coal to be prepared, so for that time, the coal needs to be imported
 
 
 lekin koyala aayaat karne ke vikalp par agar sarkaar aage badhati he to isse maujuuda dar par bijli supplai karnaa mushkil hoga, kyonki videsh se aane vaala koyala mahangaa hoga
 
 
 So, in such a situation, making the electricity bill of the common man more expensive is an option
 
 
 khaas baat yah he ki pehle power companiyaan stock main jahaan kam se kam teen hafte kaa intjaam rakhti thim, vahiin halaat ab bad se badtar ho chuke hai

 According to the Central Electricity Authority, today the situation has become so bad that 37,092 MW of power is being reduced due to coal shortage, because not only many plants have been shut down, but the government is trying to meet the increasing power shortage by creating new plants
 The plan of the project is also in a mess

 According to Ashok Khurana, the PMO is trying, but it will have to take effective steps very soon, because it takes up to three years for coal to be prepared, so for that time, the coal needs to be imported
 
 
 lekin koyala aayaat karne ke vikalp par agar sarkaar aage badhati he to isse maujuuda dar par bijli supplai karnaa mushkil hoga, kyonki videsh se aane vaala koyala mahangaa hoga
 
 
 So, in such a situation, making the electricity bill of the common man more expensive is an option

 The comments ab zaruri koyala muhaiyaa karaane main sarkaar kii naakaami ke baad videsh se koyala aayaat karne kii maang uthne lagi he
 
 
 Power companies are arguing that in the current situation it is not possible to overcome the shortage in the country through the existing resources, so the government should think seriously about importing bulk, because it is very expensive for private power companies to import coal themselves
 The deal will be proved
 
 
 ashok khurana ke mutabik piemo koshish kar rahaa he, lekin use bahut jald kargar kadam uthaane honge, kyonki koyala banane main, taiyaar hone main teen saal tak lag jate hai, isliye us samay tak kii zarurat ke liye koyale kaa aayaat to karnaa hi padegaa
 
 
 But if the government goes ahead on the option of importing coal, it will be difficult to supply electricity at the current rate, because coal coming from abroad will be expensive

 dekhen VIDEO The biggest challenge before the central government, which is preparing for the interim budget before the general elections, is to prepare a report card to handle the financial deficit during the last five years
 kendra sarkaar pichley saal vittiya ghate ke lakshya ko paane main vifal rahi he or maujuuda saal 2018-19 ke dauraan bhi vah nirdhaarit 3
 3 per cent is heading towards failing to meet the fiscal deficit target
 maujuuda saal main vifaltaa isliye nishchit he kyonki kendra sarkaar diarect tex collection or jiesti se hui kamai kii centre kii ummiido par khari nahin utari he
 After both these failures, the government has only shortcut support to avoid the red mark on the report card
 purv vitt mantri or congress netaa pi
 According to Chidambaram, the central government can now bring green marks in the economic data of deficit only with the help of GST compensation from the Reserve Bank or an interim dividend of Rs 23 thousand crore from the Reserve Bank
 india today ke sampadak anshuman tiwari ke mutabik lihaaja, vitt varsh 2019-20 ke dauraan rajasav ghaataa jidipi ke 3
 With the 3% target, the central government can show the revenue in its interim budget exaggeratedly while at the same time can hide its expenditure
 tiwari ne kaha ki kendra sarkaar ne purv ke teen maukon par rajasav ko lagbhag 600 bipies (basis point) adhik or kharch ko 400 bipies kam dikhaane kaa kaam kiya he
 Now this 3
 5 fisadi rah saktaa he
 Data Alert! # Interimbudgetsoverstate revenue growth & understate careful growth
 The last three editions overestimated tax growth by 600 bps & underestimated spending growth by 400 bps
 Actual fiscal deficit for FY20 is likely to be 3

 3% of GDP
 — anshuman tiwari (@anshuman1tiwari)january 29, 2019budget 2019: modi sarkaar ke 5 bajet, 5 saal baad aaj kahaan khadaa he deshkhas baat he ki may 2014 main bhartiya janata party ke netritv main banane vaali modi sarkaar ko sarkari khajaane par badi raahat kachche tel kii keemton main ai giravat ke taur par mili
 This relief made it easier for the central government to control the fiscal deficit
 vahiin sarkaar ko is badi bachat ke jariye apane aarthik kaaryakramon ko majboot karne kaa mauka bhi mila
 But where did the Modi government, which managed to handle the deficit at the beginning of its tenure, later get stuck about its expenditure that it had to pursue the deficit target set in the budget
 jaane modi sarkaar ke paanch saal or vittiya ghate main utaar-chadhaav
 The Central Government passed the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act in 2003, which sets the target of fiscal deficit for it
 haalanki kharch or ghate ke santulan ko banaae rakhane main sarkarein vifal hone lagati hai to vah is act ke tahat nirdhaarit ghate ke lakshya main pherbadal karti rahi hai
 Budget 2019: Last year, what are the expectations of the farmers from the Modi government? The current central government also set up a review committee under the chairmanship of NK Singh in 2016 to revise the current Act to increase the target
 haalanki is samiti ne 31 march 2020 tak vittiya ghate kaa lakshya jidipi kaa 3 fisadi rakhaa or ise 2020-21 ke liye 2
 8 per cent and 2 by 2023
 5 fisadi kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya
 However, in the budget 2017, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley stated 3 of the fiscal deficit target set by this committee
 2 fisadi vittiya ghate kaa lakshya tay kiya
 The Central Government was also criticized for this decision and according to the data, the Government did not meet this target of fiscal deficit in Budget 2018
 kendra sarkaar ne iske liye kai kaaran ginaae jinamein ahm he jiesti se ummid ke mutabik rajasav na ekatra hona or kachche tel kii keemton main ek baar phir oochaal aana
 At the same time, given the general elections during the current year, it is expected to spend populist expenditure on the central government
 modi ko kisi mili thi iconomi? chidambaram ke aakhri bajet main chhipi he sachchaipane pehle bajet bhaashan main jetali ne vitt varsh 2014-15 ke liye vittiya ghate kaa lakshya 4
 Claiming to be 3% by 2016-17, keeping 1%
 gauratlab he ki 2011-12 main vittiya ghaataa 5
 7 per cent and was reduced to 4 in 2012-13 under the previous UPA government
 8 fisadi kar liya gaya
 Financial losses in 2013-144
 5 fisadi karte hue modi sarkaar ko may 2014 main kaman saunpi gai
 In his first budget speech on this target, Jaitley said that former Finance Minister P
K
 chidambaram unhen vittiya ghate kaa ek kadaa lakshya dekar gaye hai
 At the same time, in the budget of 2015-16, Jaitley claimed that he would achieve the target set by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act in two to three years
 purv main sarkaar kii kavayad 2016-17 tak is 3 fisadi ke lakshya ko praapt karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 Hence, Jaitley gave a 3 for 2015-16 while giving a new target to overcome the financial deficit
 9 fisadi, 2016-17 ke liye 3
 Set a fiscal deficit target of 5 per cent and 3 per cent of GDP for 2017-18
 is lakshya main sarkaar mahaj 3
 Could achieve the target of 9 percent
 pichley saal 2018-19 kii bajet spich main vitt mantri ne vittiya ghate par lagaam lagane kii daawa kiya
 Jaitley said that the losses in his tenure were 4 of 2013-14
 4 fisadi ke str se kam kar 2017-18 tak 3
 5 percent tax has been taken
 agle vitt varsh 2018-19 ke liye sarkaar ne 3
 Set a fiscal deficit target of 3 per cent
 ab aagaamee bajet ke aankadon main dekhnaa he ki kendra sarkaar vittiya ghate ko kaabo karne kii disha main apane kaarykaal ko kaisaa bataati he
 Can the fiscal deficit of less than 3 per cent be expected by 2020 as suggested by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act during the current financial year? desh ke share bazaaron main guuruuvaar ko jabardast teji dekhi gai

 Pakistan began their campaign by defeating Bangladesh, although it was a close contest
 vahiin srilankai team bharat ke khilaaf bade lakshya ko paar karne main asafal rahi or use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In response to India's target of 304 runs, Sri Lanka were reduced to 50 runs

 Mohsin has been made Minister of State in Adityanath's cabinet
 yogi cabinet main grahamantri rajnath singh ke bete pankaj singh kaa naam nahin hona chaunkaane vaali baat he
 After Pankaj Singh got the assembly ticket from Noida, there was a discussion that if BJP comes to power, they will be strong contenders for the post of minister, but it did not happen
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki 403 vidhansabha vaale uttar pradesh chunaav main bijepi ne kisi bhi musalmaan ko tikat nahin diya tha, jiske chalate unhen virodhiyon ke hamale bhi jhelane pade the
 None of the 325 mlas who won on the ticket of BJP and its allies are Muslims

 It is worth noting that in the 403 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, BJP did not give tickets to any Muslims, due to which they had to face the attacks of opponents
 bijepi or uske sahyogi dalon ke tikat par jitkar aae 325 vidhayakon main koi bhi musalmaan nahin he
 Even after this, Mohsin Raza is being included in Yogi Adityanath's cabinet
 vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle bijepi main shaamil hue mohsin raja purv cricketer hai
 BJP had made him a spokesperson, due to which he is often seen on TV channels keeping the bjp's side

 Thankfully, that threat now seems to be passing away
 iran or america ke rishton par jameen barf ab kuch pigal rahi he
 Because those who were dead until death
 wo ab baatcheet ke teble par aane ko raji ho rahe hai
 Yes, it is true that US President Trump and Iranian President Hassan Ruhani have agreed to meet each other
 magar is mahamilan se pehle donon mulkon ko kuch sharton se hokar guzaranaa padegaa
 Overall, the bottom line is that after this warmth in the relationship, the world is desperate to hear that the threat of world war will be averted
 ye khabar yakeenan hairaan karne vaali he
 But the truth is
 haalanki is sach ko bhi hakeekat banane se pehle kai sharton se hokar guzaranaa padegaa
 Nobody thought that even these two countries could ever come to a table together
 lekin gunjaish ke jo darvaaze khidkiyaan band the
 They are now opening
 khud america raashtrapati donald trump ne bayaan dekar ye hairaan karne vaali khabar duniya ko di he
 Trump says he would like to meet Iranian President Hassan Ruhani
 magar sahi mauka or maahaul dekhakar
 The relationship between the two countries has come under considerable strain since the US unilateral withdrawal of the 2015 agreement banning Iran's nuclear program last year
 magar france ke raashtrapati emanuel maikraan kii pahal ke baad donon deshon ke rishton par jami barf ke pighalane ke asaar nazar aane lage hai
 Macron also invited the Foreign Minister of Iran to the G7 meeting in France
 donon ne khadi main tension ke halaat ko kam karne ke liye lambii baatcheet kii

 Trump's remarks came at the summit of the G7 countries
 is baithak main ji7 desh jinamein canada, frans, germany, italy, japan, britain or amarika shaamil rahe
 Where many issues were discussed
 magar baatcheet ke centre main america or iran ke bich kaa tanaav rahaa
 Because on the one hand, the US pulled itself out of the JCPA or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action deal and on the other hand it is continuously imposing new sanctions on Iran
 jisaki vajah se iran naaraaz he
 This is why both countries have come face to face
 jessipie iran ke saath pi5 plus van deshon ke saath deal ko kehete hai
 Which includes China, France, Russia, England and the United States, along with the permanent member countries, Germany
 jisamen ye tay kiya gaya tha ki iran apane parmaanu kaaryakramon par roak laga degaa
 And in return the trade restrictions imposed on it will be lifted
 magar america main donald trump ke raashtrapati banate hi unhone is deal se khud ko alag kar diya
 And there was an atmosphere of tremendous tension between the two countries
 isse pehle irani raashtrapati hasan ruhani ne bhi america par apana rukh naram karte hue kaha tha ki agar unhen lagata he ki is tension ko kam karne ke liye koi bich kaa rasta nikal saktaa he
 And if Iran gets benefited by that route, then he is ready to meet anyone
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki france main iran ke videsh mantri mohammad javwaad zareef auki france ke videsh mantri or francisi raashtrapati maikraan ke saath baatcheet main bich kaa rasta nikal aayaa he
 After which the situation of the meeting between the President of the two countries i
e
 Trump and Rohani has also been created
 haalanki abhi is deal ko lekar kuch pakkaa nahin he or chizein najuk daur main he
 But talks have started on some technical issues and progress is being made
 aapako bataa den ki amarika ne beete saal may main samjhaute se alag hone kii ghoshnaa kii thi or nae parmaanu samjhaute or pratibandhon ko hataane ke liye 12 sharten lagaai thim
 This included conditions such as banning the ballistic missile program from Iran and abstaining from engaging in the neighborhood tension
 jise iran ne maanane se inkaar kar diya tha
 Now in the new agreement with Iran, the US wants Iran to stay away from nuclear weapons and ballistic missile for a long time
 haalanki abhi ye saafe nahin hua ki in nai sharton ko iran maanegaa yaa nahin

 Well, i no longer serve my ego and therefore am not afraid to speak up

 Animals are so important to this planet and doing what he did and then mocking it was a huge act of his own self importance
 Lots of children look up to him, and he has a responsibility to the young people
 What is he showing the world when he does things like this? What lessons is he giving them? That it is ok to break the law, to kill animals and then mock it because he is a celebrity? In any western country he would have been vilified for this and the drink driving deaths that he caused
 He has then reinvented himself as a charitable man to try and compensate his karma
 Today, India has shown that no matter who you are, if you break the law, you are no bigger than the law
 i have heard so many young people in India speak about how they are afraid to go to the police about crimes committed by others because they watch the TV and see how people with money and status get away with it because they have paid off the police or the judge or the lawyers
 This happened to me when Armaan Kohli paid off 2 of my lawyers so that i could not continue with the case, Dolly Bindra also told me that Armaans family are powerful enough to put drugs in my bag at the airport and i would be in Jail
 i had to then drop the case as all the lawyers i hired were paid off

 maavi ne aage kaha ki patelon ke raajnneetik dabadabe ke maddenjar unhen gujarat sarkaar or centre kii narendra modi sarkaar se apni maangon par baat kerani chahie
 He claimed that there is a force behind Hardik and he approached the Gurjars because he knows that Gurjars are a spunky community and his support will help them to pressurize the government to demand Patel reservation

 Former England spinner Graeme Swann has refused to recognize Australian batsman Steven Smith as a great batsman
 swaan ke mutabik, smith ko lekar england kii team pareshaan nahin he or naa hi unke raaton kii neend udi he
 Swann retired from cricket in the middle of the 2013–14 ashes, but before that he had taken Smith's wicket three times in 22 innings
 swaan ne kaha, '26 saal ke smith kii takanic main karaab he or vah swing karti gend ko thik se nahin khel sakate or unhen aashcharya he ki vah isisi kii maujuuda test ballebaazon kii ranking main number ek ballebaaz kaise ban gaye'
 The 36-year-old English spinner also said that Smith is not invincible like Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist
 haalanki england ke liye 60 test main 255 wicket lene vaale swaan ne steve wa kii jamkar taareef kiya or smith se tulana bhi kar daalaa
 According to Swan, getting out was not a matter of any bowler's bus, but it is not so with Smith
 tippaniyan Steven Smith's superb form can be gauged from the fact that he scored 102 in 16 innings of 8 Tests in the last one year
 16 kii ausat se 1226 ran banaae hai
 During this time, his bat also produced 5 centuries and 5 fifties
 zaahir he aise shandaar form main chal rahe smith se england kii team khoff main he
 For this reason, former players of the team have adopted a method of morale-breaking by making statements
 swaan ne 2013-14 aishez ke bich main hi cricket se sanyas le liya tha, lekin isse pehle wo 22 pariyon main teen baar smith kaa wicket le chuke the
 "the 26-year-old Smith is poor in technique and cannot play the swinging ball properly and he wonders how he became the number one batsman in the icc's ranking of current Test batsmen," Swann said
 36 saal ke is english spinner ne yah bhi kaha ki smith, mathew heden or adam gilcrist kii tarah ajey nahin hai
 However, Swann, who took 255 wickets in 60 Tests for England, praised Steve Waugh and compared him to Smith
 swaan ke mutabik wa out karnaa kisi bhi gendbaaz ke bas kii baat nahin thi, lekin smith ke saath aisa nahin he
 The comments steven smith ke shandaar form kaa andaaza isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhone pichley ek saal main 8 test kii 16 pariyon main 102
 Has scored 1226 runs at an average of 16
 is dauraan unke balle se 5 shatak or 5 ardhshtak bhi nikle
