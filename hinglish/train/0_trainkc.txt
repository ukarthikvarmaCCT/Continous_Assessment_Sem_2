 jo chotein thim, vah atyant gambhir kism kii thim
 Athani said that the girl's condition was stable for the first five days after treatment and there were signs of improvement, but her condition worsened due to sepsis (blood transfusion)
 doctor ne kaha, uski ichhashakti prabal thi or usne police ko do bayaan die
 She was conscious
 athani ne kaha ki para-medical kii chaatra kaa safadarajang aspataal main or hawaii ambulance se singapore ke mount elizbeth medical centre le jane ke baad vahaan bhi behtareen ilaaj kiya gaya
 The hospital in Singapore is known for having multiple organ transplant facilities

 Dr
 Mehta said that the girl's condition deteriorated more there than in Delhi

 His condition was worse than in Delhi
 use bahut gambhir chotein ai thim or hamane use bachaane ke liye bharsak prayaas kiye
 Mehta also said that the decision was taken to take the victim from Hawaii ambulance to Singapore as the hospital is one of the best hospitals for organ transplantation
 ek or mukhya kaaran yah bhi tha ki uski jaan bachaana sabase pehla uddeshy tha
 Dr
 Athani said, she was a very brave girl
 unhone kaha ki safadarajang aspataal ke doctoron ne uski gambhir haalat ko dekhte hue use bachaane ke prayaason main koi kasar nahin chodi, lekin uski choton kii prakruti aisi thi ki use bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 Dr
 Athani said, even extremely serious patients with such injuries are admitted to the ICU and many of them survive
 yah ek atyant gambhir maamla tha
 The comments unhone kaha ki safadarajang aspataal ke doctoron, nurson or para-medical staff ne sachmuch kadaa parishram kiya
 It also got its reward and she was able to survive for at least 12 days after being brought here in a critically injured state on the night of 16 December
 chauthe din se uski haalat bigadane lagi
 She did not recover at all after the third operation
 uski chetana kaa str bhi kam ho gaya tha

 In response to the criticisms, Dr

" unhone kaha ki marij singapore ke aspataal main 48 ghante jivit rahi or yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki use vahaan nahin bheja janaa chahie tha
 Dr Mehta said, secondly, there is no comparison between government hospitals in India and Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore
 main doctoron kii kushalta ke bare main nahin, balki buniyadi suvidhaon ke bare main baat kar rahaa hum
 We should know this
 dow athani ne kaha ki peedit kii aant or anya angon main atyant gambhir chotein thim
 He said, we had removed a large part of his bowel due to infection

 dow mehta ne kaha, duusari baat yah he ki bharat main sarkari aspataalon or singapore ke mount elizbeth aspataal ke bich koi tulana nahin he
 i am not talking about the efficiency of doctors, but about basic facilities
 hamen yah pataa hona chahie
 Dr
 Athani stated that the victim had extremely serious injuries to the intestine and other organs
 unhone kaha, hamane uski aant kaa bahut bada hissaa sankraman kii vajah se nikaal diya tha
 The injuries were very serious
 athani ne kaha ki ilaaj ke baad shuruaati paanch din tak ladki kii haalat sthir thi or sudhaar ke sanket dikh rahe the, lekin sepsis (rakt main sankraman) hone kii vajah se uski haalat bighad gai
 The doctor said, his willpower was strong and he gave two statements to the police

 "we met him before leaving for Delhi on Friday," he said
 dilli kii tulana main uski haalat zyada kharaab ho gai thi
 He had very serious injuries and we tried our best to save him
 mehta ne bhi kaha ki peedit ko hawaii ambulance se singapore le jane kaa faisla isliye kiya gaya, kyonki vah aspataal ang pratiropan ke liye behtareen aspataalon main se ek he
 Another main reason was that the first objective was to save his life
 dow athani ne kaha, vah bahut bahadur ladki thi
 He said that the doctors at Safdarjung Hospital did not spare any effort to save him in view of his critical condition, but the nature of his injuries was such that he could not be saved
 dow athani ne kaha, aisi choton vaale atyant gambhir marijon ko bhi isiu main bhartee kiya jaataa he or unamem se kai batch jate hai
 This was a very serious matter
 tippaniyan He said that the doctors, nurses and para-medical staff of Safdarjung Hospital worked really hard

 Dr
 Mehta said, his condition had deteriorated while leaving Safdarjung Hospital
 use bahut buree tarah jakhmi kiya gaya tha
 No part of his intestine was in good condition
 peedit ko singapore ke aspataal main kyon bheja gaya
 To this, Dr
 Mehta said, "the hospital there is one of the best hospitals in this part of the world and i have had many conversations with the doctors there
 maine vahaan kii suvidhaayen or upkaran khud dekhe hai

 The yatra, which began with the Gaje Baje, roamed many areas of Old Delhi, reached the same Durga temple whose idols were recently broken after a dispute over scooty parking

 Whoever broke the idols did it wrong
 shobhaayatra ke baad dubaara mandir main praan pratishtha ke baad murtiyon ko sthapit kar diya gaya
 This time, the situation in the area should not deteriorate, so about 3,000 personnel of paramilitary forces were deployed with the Delhi Police, the soldiers were seen monitoring from the roof of every house
 shobhaayatra ke raste par 90 sisitivi camere lagaae gaye, drone se bhi nazar rakhi ja rahi thi

 And because of this, a strange character like Jordan of Rock Star also tempts you

 Imtiaz Ali tries to follow a new path through the film Highway

 It is also very different from the trend of Bollywood films

 Apart from this, the highway is also a very dull film

 isliye us par un chetavaniyon kaa bhi koi asar nahin hota, jo veeraa ke baap ke sambandhon or anjaamon se judi hui hai
 After the initial difficulties, this trip for Veera starts becoming a way to understand 'india that is India'

 Dawood Ibrahim, once the uncrowned king of the world of crime and the second name of terror in Mumbai, has been absconding from India for 25 years
 is bich uske pakistan or UAE main hone kii khufia jaankariyaan bhi milin, lekin bharat sarkaar ab tak uskaa pratyrpan hasil karne main safal nahin ho saki he
 Now questions are also being raised whether the don can be brought to India while alive
 agenda ajtak ke chathe satr main bhi yahi sawaal haaavee rahaa
 Agenda on Dawood's extradition The three former top CBI officials, who took part in the sixth session of Aaj Tak, spoke
 daaud ke pratyrpan main kya hai adchanendilli ke purv police kamishnar niraj kumaar se jab poocha gaya ki daaud ko bharat laane main itane varsh kyon lag gaye or kya adchane hai to unhone kaha, "daaud abrahim ko pakadana isliye mushkil ho gaya he kyonki vah ek aise desh main chipa he vahaan duniyabar ke aatanki chhipe hai or vah lagaataar is baat ko nakaarta rahata he
 In this sequence, Pakistan has not always considered Dawood's presence in Pakistan
 lihaaja dupaksheeya sambandhon ke chalate ye kaam mushkil ho gaya he
 So it is limited to Dawood only
 kyonki beete kuch dashakon main desh kii police ne kai bade don jaise chota rajan ko pakadaney main safalataa pai he
 Apart from this, great success has been found in the work of catching big terrorists in many places all over the country
 "daaud ke girebaan ke kitne najadiksibiai ke purv diarector anil sinha se jab poocha gaya ki kya is dauraan bharat kabhi daaud ko pakadaney ke kareeb pahunchaa, to unka jawaab tha, "jahaan tak don kii baat he to ham sabhi jaanate hai ki chota rajan bhi kabhi don tha, use ham laae
 We also managed to arrest Abu Salem who was also called Don
 don hi nahin techrists ko bhi pakadaa ja saktaa he
 Our forces and intelligence agencies have so much capacity and capability that we can catch any criminal from anywhere in the world
 "daaud ke pratyrpan main itnaa samay kyoyiparadhiyon ko nyaay ke daravaaje tak pahunchane main lagane vaale atyadhik samay ko lekar unhone kaha, "hamaara desh koi shararti desh nahin he or na hi hamaari milishia koi shararti milishia he
 We are a country under a decided justice process
 isliye vakt lagata he
 Especially when some other country has sheltered a criminal or a terrorist, then the trouble increases
 yah pareshaani tab or bad jaati he jab vah desh hameshaa inkaar kii mudra main ho
 "making a direct reference to Pakistan, Anil Sinha said that you should always ask him that you have sheltered the terrorists, they will never accept
 paper work, deshon ke bhinn kanoon hai adchanmumbai ke purv kamishnar apurv patnayak se jab yahi sawaal kiya gaya ki mumbai kaa sabase bada dushman daaud ab tak waapas kyon nahin laayaa ja sakaa
 So he told, "just as Ram's name is bigger than Ram, in the same way, Dawood's name was bigger than Dawood
 90 ke dashak main jab main mumbai gaya tab vahaan ilaake aise hote the- yah gavali kaa ilaaka, yah daaud kaa ilaaka
 At that time there was a nexus of business, film, politics in Mumbai
 aisa koi bijness nahin hota tha, jisase daaud kaa naam na judaa ho
 But after the serial bomb blast in 92, circumstances changed
 paper work or do deshon ke alag-alag kanoon ke chalate kisi apradhi ko pratyrpit karaane main saalon lag jate hai
 "we are capable of performing surgical strikes against Dawood," says Anil Sinha, "surgical strikes were an example of our ability
 ham daaud kaa yahaan laana chaahate hai, yah mumkin he or yah hokar rahegaa
 Action will be taken according to the time, situation and requirement
 ham pehle se yah kabhi nahin bataaenge ki ham yah karne ja rahe hai
 "at the same time, Anil Sinha says our position is strong today
 ham kisi desh se bheekh nahin maangate, yachana nahin karte ki daaud ko hamen de dijie
 We rightfully say that under this process and provision of law, this person can be assigned to us
 niraj kumaar ne vahiin kehete hai, "daaud ko maut se pehle bharat kaise laayaa jaae, iskaa jawaab yah he ki hamen kuch extro ordinary saboot jutaney honge, jo daaud ko samay par bharat waapas laane main madad kare
 " bharat main sankhyikeey aankadon main 'raajnneetik dakhal' par gahari chintaa jataate hue 108 arthshaastriyon or samajashastriyon ne 'sansthaaon kii aazaadee' ko behaal karne or sankhyikeey sanghathanon kii eemaandaaree ko banaae rakhane kaa aahvaan kiya he
 This statement has come in the wake of the controversy in the matter of revising the gross domestic product (GDP) figures and withholding the employment figures by the NSSO

 During a press conference in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that the Delhi government completely rejects the management quota in nursery admission

 Actually Kejriwal was speaking on the guidelines of Delhi Private School Nursery Admission
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kii tamaam koshishon or majboot nirnyon ke baavjood bhi shikaayatein mil rahi hai
 He has told private schools that apart from 25 per cent quota of EWS, 75 per cent seats should not be reserved
 kejariwal ne kaha kiskulon ne kota rigerv karne ke liye alag-alag criteriabana liya he
 Many schools have even given the criterion that parents whose parents are non-vegetarians, drink alcohol or cigarettes will not get admission

 At the same time, Federation of Public Schools President RP Malik says that the management quota case is in court for the last one year
 agar sarkaar is tarah kaa koi aadesh detii he to humlog court jaaenge
 In fact, the Delhi High Court in its 28 November 2014 decision rejected the guidelines based on the governor's point system and also empowered the schools to prepare their own guidelines for admission

 Javed ji should not use his celebrity so lightly

 tanwir ji ko teen lakh saath hajaar vot mili the
 The CPI also fought by forming an alliance with Nitishji's party
 unako do lakh se bhi kam vot mili the
 Today the CPI is fighting alone by making Kanhaiya a candidate

 He will remember how it was

 Therefore, the CPI is requested to withdraw its candidate and support Tanvir Hasan, the grand alliance candidate

 According to the Delhi Women's Commission, if the authorities take action against a spa, the owner of the spa acquires another license in the same premises by another name
 spa centre ke karmchaaree or prabandhak bhi vahiin rahete hai
 Prostitution and other illegal activities continue unabated there
 isliye nagar nigamon dwaara kii gai karrwai ab parisar ke pate par aadhaarit honi chahie
 The owners of the spa should enter the Aadhaar number and PAN number so that the same person, who has once been prosecuted for wrongdoing, is not allowed to reopen the spa by another name or other address
 dilli mahila ayog ki adhyaksha swati maliwal ne kaha, 'hamen emsidi or police kaa kaam karnaa pad rahaa he
 Why were these spa centers allowed to grow like mushrooms? Why did MCD sleep for so many years? Why was cross sex massage allowed behind closed doors? Why was no NOC taken from the police before running these spas? How much has the MCD and the police made a blind eye to these illegal activities? Swati Maliwal said that they have a lot to answer
 haalanki south emsidi ne maamle main ek adwijuri jari karne kaa daawa kiya he, unhen yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki dilli mahila ayog kii ore se soochibaddh sabhi binduon ko isamen shaamil kiya jaae

 About 20 such earthquakes may occur in 2018

 Meanwhile, in a residential area in Dattanagar, Pune, a CCTV camera captures something strange
 do logon ke bich pehle kisi baat ko lekar kaha suni hoti he or phir jald hi kahasuni dhakka-mukki main tabdeel ho jaati he
 But one of these people is more restless
 wo dhakka-mukki se hat kar kuch talashne lagata he
 And then the next moment he moves with a stone in one hand
 parking aria main ho rahi is jhadap main tab tak doosraa shaks apane aane vaale vakt se bekhbar he, lekin is baar jaise hi uskaa pehle shaks se saamana hota he, wo sidhe haath main pakade pathar se duusare shaks ke sir paravaar kar daalatahai
 This attacker is Dhananjay Mor, while the victim is Abhijeet to kill
 donon padosi hai
 No one can think of what happens after that
 dhananjay mor ke pathar kehmalese abhijit maarane fouran neeche gir padataa he or wo chatapataane lagata he, lekin dhananjay kaa gussa shant hone kii bajaay or bad jaataa he
 He strikes Abhijeet again with the same stone, but after that he does not stop even a second, but starts searching again with restlessness
 khambhe kii oot main gira abhijit tadap rahaa hota he
 After a few seconds, Halavar Dhananjay is again visible in front of the camera, but this time with a huge and heavy stone and then the same stone falls on Abhijeet falling on the ground
 iske baad ek, do, teen, chaar
 
 
 And thus one by one he crushes Abhijeet for the entire ten times with this big stone
 kabhi wo pathar abhijit ke sir par de martha he, kabhi seene par, kabhi qamar par, to kabhi taangon par
 
 
 With every blow, Abhijeet, lying on the ground, yearns, bursts up, begging for mercy amidst senses and unconsciousness
 or to or khud hi apane jakhmi haathon se us pathar ko pakad kar apane hamalavar ko khud par or waar karne se rokane kii koshish karata he, lekinhamlavardhananjay rukne kaa naam hi nahin letaa
 All this is so terrible that it is difficult to keep an eye on this scene, but the attacker does not sweat his heart
 wo bich-bich main ek aadh baar laat maar kar bhi apni khiz mitaatha he or aas-paas fatakane vaale logon ko daraa kar dur bhaga detaa he
 No one came forward to save, now let us show you another picture of this incident with another camera
 is camere main saafe dikh rahaa he, dhananjay more kis tarah zamin par gire abhijit ko kuchal rahaa he, lekin vahaan dasiyon logon ke parking spes main khadey hone ke baavjood unhen dhananjay ke kareeb jane kii himmat nahin hoti
 And then when Dhananjay is exhausted from time to time, some women fall on the ground and start crying, it is only some women who stop Dhananjay and then beat him lightly
 is
 jakhmi abhijit tab tak jameen par hi padaa tadapata rahata he
 From here Dhananjay talks to someone on his mobile and then immediately runs out of the spot
 darasal, aamane-saamne flats main rahane vaale dhananjay ko ye shaq tha ki abhijit kii uski bivi se kuch nazdikiyaan hai or bas isi ek shaq kii binah par dhananjay ne jo kuch kiya, us par yakeen kar paanaa bhi mushkil he
 But the photos never lie
 ab haalat ye he ki jism par bisiyon fracture liye abhijit jahaan ek aspataal main jindagi or maut ke bich jhul rahaa he, vahiin dhananjay he ki takreeban das din guzarane ke baavjood police us tak nahin pahunch saki he

 After the announcement of demonetisation, Prime Minister Modi asked for a 50-day deferment from the people and assured the people that the situation would be normal after 50 days
 piem modi ne kaha tha ki 50 din baad logon ko cash kii killat nahin sahani hogi
 After about one and a half month i
e
 45 days, Delhi till date, the operators have visited the queues of atms at different places
 sabase pehla padaav- conot placedelli kaa dil kahe jane vaale conot place jahaan ek saath 5 atm mili lekin cash sirf ek main tha
 Rest of atms closed
 ab aise main chaalu atm main logon kii qatari laazmi he
 The question is that if the rest of the atms were also working, then this line would be shorter and people would get relief
 aglaa padaav- karol bagyahan teen atm ek saath mili lekin logon ke hataash chehron se saafe samaj aayaa ki ye atm band pade hai
 According to people, there are 5 atms in the area, but not one
 agar koi chal bhi jaae to usame lambii line hoti he
 Now who is responsible for these bad or cashless atms even after one and a half months after demonetisation? Next stop- Paharganj, Paharganj market is the stronghold of small traders, hence only cash is run here
 lekin vidmbana dekhie market len main kul 4 atm hai lekin bamushkil hi kisi atm main paisa dalata he
 In such a situation, people just keep waiting for the cash
 aglaa padaav- dariyaganjadariyaganj main ek saath 7 bainko ke atm mili lekin vahaan bhi ek hi pareshaani karaab or band pade atm
 Only 1 ATM was found to be in working condition, with queues being sparse
 darasal band pade atm ke liye koi kaarywai nahin he
 Next stop- The condition of atms in Sarita Vihar / Okhalasarita Vihar Market is also disturbed
 yahaan 5 atm hai lekin kisi main bhi cash nahin mila
 Badarpur also has 6 atms but no cash
 kul milakar atm yatra kaa nateeja ye niklaa ki dilli ke kai atm main 46 din ke baad bhi cash ki killat he

 When Indian captain Virat Kohli decided to bat after winning the toss on the first day of the Colombo Test, he would not have thought that Team India's start would be very bad
 pehle hi over main dhamika prasad ne murali vijay ko chalata kar diya, lekin khaas baat ye dikhi ki team india ne number teen ballebaaz ke taur par rohit sharma ko nahin bheja
 Rohit Sharma, who was described as the best captain of the team's captain and director number 3, tried to protect him from Sri Lankan fast bowlers and Ajinkya Rahane was promoted and sent as the number 3 batsman
 jaahir he ye badlaav ajinkya rahane ke liye bhi acha nahin rahaa he or ve mahaj chaar ran banaakar out ho gaye
 Rahane scored 4 runs, playing 11 balls
 ve dhamika prasad kii of stump se baahar jaati gend ko apane sharir se dur khilne kii koshish main teesri slip main lapke gaye
 This was Rahane's 17th Test and he was introduced as the number three batsman for the first time
 ye rahane ko mauka dene ke badale rohit sharma ke dabaav ko kam karne kii koshish thi, lekin team prabandhan kaa ye daanv ulta pad gaya
 However, this effort has put more questions on Rohit Sharma's presence in Team India
 yah sab tab ho rahaa he ki jab maujuuda team kaa sabase behtareen number 3 ballebaaz bench par baithne ko majboor he
 Rohit Sharma as No
 3 batsman has scored 107 runs in 3 Tests at an average of 26, while Cheteshwar Pujara has scored 1814 runs in 24 Tests at No
 3 as an No
 3 batsman
 isamen 6 shatak bhi shaamil he
 In such a situation, only Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri can tell the reason for excluding Cheteshwar Pujara as the number 3 batsman
 bhartiya team ke fielding coach aar shridhar ne khulaasa kiya ki ajinkya rahane raaton raat nahin balki abhyaas satr ke dauraan saikadon kaich lene ke baad bharat ke sarvshereshth slip fielder bane
 Working hard, Rahaneshridhar said of Rahane, who made the world record for taking the most catches in an innings, "he (rahane) has turned into an excellent slip fielder
 usamen acha slip fielder banane kaa jajba he

 usne saikadon kaich liye or uskaa ravaiya spasht he ki vah kya karnaa chahta he, vah kahaan un kaich ko chahta he, kitni oonchai par chahta he jaisaa ki match main uske saamne kaich aa sakate hai
 'ajinkya Rahane is an excellent slip fielder, he added,' Also he understands very well what angle and how fast the catch can come
 isse pehle hamane dharna kii baat kii thi or usne slip main khadey hone ke liye khud ko har tarah se taiyaar kiya
 He has become a good slip fielder which is good for the team
 'slip main sthai sangyojan hona chahieshridhar ne slip kshetra main sthaayee sangyojan kii jarurat par jor diya jo ki team kii safalataa ke liye jaruri he
 He said, "we prefer a permanent combination in the slip area but we have no control over injuries
" aapane srilanka main dekha hoga
 Shikhar Dhawan and Murali Vijay were injured
 iske baad lokesh rahul ko slip main khadaa hona padaa
 It is beneficial for us to have a good slip fielder for Virat Kohli and Ajinkya
 ham sthai sangyojan chaahate hai lekin jab yah hamaare niyantran main nahin ho to ham sarvshereshth uplabdh kshetrarakshak ko slip main rakhte hai
 "new plans are being made for slip," said Shridhar, "apart from this, our plan is to keep the left-handed player in the outside slip for the left-handed batsman and the right-handed player in the outside slip for the right-handed batsman
 ' bharat or dakshin africa main se sarvshereshth kshetrarakshakon ke bare main puche jane par shridhar ne kaha, 'aap kah sakate ho ki abi divilliars acha kshetrarakshak he lekin meraa maananaa he ki ravindra jadeja naiysargik athlete he
 Every player in our team does something different which has made them collectively a good fielding unit
 'fielderon ko reating dene se kiya inkaarunhone kaha, 'viraat urjavan he
 Ajinkya is agile as a close fielder
 koi shantchit rahata he to shikhar gajab kaa athlete he
 So it is a very good team in fielding
 ' shridhar ne mohali main team ke kshetrarakshan pradarshan kii tarif kii lekin saaf kiya ki vah kshetrarakshakon ko reating nahin dena chaahate
 He said, 'it will be difficult for me to rate the efforts of everyone but as a team and captain, Virat wants this and what these players are doing as young cricketers is a process of improvement

 " punjab main captain amarinder singh kii sarkaar ko bane puure saadhe teen maheene ho chuke hai lekin punjab sarkaar main ek aise mantri bhi hai jo in 3 maheenon main ek bhi baar CM sachivalay main sthit apane daftar main nahin gaye hai
 Yes, he did go to take charge of his ministerial post
 lekin, in mantri mahoday ne uske baad kabhi bhi apane offis main jhaank kar nahin dekha
 The reason for this was that the look of the office was not according to their profile and style
 ham baat kar rahe hai punjab ke hiprophile or tejatarraar mantri navjot singh siddhu kii
 On the one hand, the Punjab government says that VIP culture has to be abolished and spending is cut
 duusari taraf haalat yah he ki punjab main kisaan lagaataar khudakhushi kar rahe hai or teesri sthiti yah he ki punjab main bahut sari scimen sirf paise ke abhaav ke chalate band padi he lekin in sab ke baavjood mantri mahadev ke aisho aaraam or shaano-shaukat main koi kami nahin ai he or pichley 3 maheene se bhi zyada samay se navjot singh siddhu ke offis main kaam lagaataar jari he
 The Aaj Tak team took a review of Navjot Singh Sidhu's Five Star Type office
 ek taraf punjab ke mukhyamantri aaj apane sau dinon kaa hawala dete hue kah rahe the ki hamane kharchon main katautee kii he, viipi culture ko khatm kiya he to vahiin duusari taraf siddhu sahab kaa yah aaleeshaan offis
 In this office, it is obvious not to read Sidhu Saheb's Charan Kamal even once
 vipaksh ne is mudde par sarkaar ko gherne kii puri koshish kii he purv cabinet mantri dalajit cheema kaa kahana he ki siddhu ko naa janata se or naa hi apane offis se koi matlab he
 Spending more time in Mumbai than in Punjab and spending crores of rupees in spite of spending on office shows how much the government is worried about Punjab
 jis samyanvajot singh siddhuke offis main renovations kaa kaam shuru hua tha us samay khud navjot singh siddhu orpunjabake kai mantri samet unki patni navjot cor ne kaha tha ki koi kharchaa nahin ho rahaa he sirf is kamare main rang-rogan kiya ja rahaa he lekin is rang rogan main lagbhag 50 lakh ke kareeb sarkari khajaana kharch ho chukaa he or puure furniture se lekar farsh or chat tak ko badla ja chukaa he
 But, Congress ministers and Sidhu's colleagues are still saying that it needs a palace

 viksit or loktantric samaajon main kabhi-kabhi kuch bahes is haalat main pahunch jaati he ki jinhen chede or udhede bina kaam nahin chalata
 In the beginning, it is difficult to decide whether there will be trouble in avoiding these debates or by giving them comfort, but it is definitely felt that it is impossible to quit
 jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay (jeenyu) kii ghatana main chaatro kii uttejnaa yaa pulisia aturata, jo ki taatkaalik thi, use alag kar diya jaae to rashtrawaad kii vah bahes hamaare haath lagati he jo bharat ke udaaravaadi loktantr ke bheetar apni jagah bananaa chaahati he
 Actually, this debate has been seething around us for decades and it wants to burst
 yah is bahes ke liye sabase upyukt mauka he, isliye nahin ki rashtrawaad banaam udaaravaadi loktantr kii bahes achaanak shuru ho gai he balki bharat kaa bauddhik samaaj is tarah kii bahes ko sanbhaalane kii kuwwat se las he
 It is not in our nature to fear debates or to stir up conspiracies in discourse
 asmita, darshan, vichaar, pahchaan va rashtrawaad kii bahasein saikadon saal se hamaare irdagird tairti, takaraati or thirati rahi hai, kyonki ham ek vaividhya purna samaaj hai jo vibhajit hone main takat talash letaa he
 The recent debate of nationalism versus democratic liberalism is the pinnacle of these old debates, which calls for a reevaluation of the basic values of Indian society and expresses disagreement with the status quo
 rashtrawaad ek bhaavana he or udaaravaadi loktantr ek tarksheel vyavastha
 Fireworks abound in this collision
 phir bhi hamen ek baar ji kadaa karte hue is bahes ke jhatkon ke liye taiyaar hona hoga
 In the meantime, our belief that everything is justified in a liberal democracy, on the other hand, nationalist urges can turn sub-nationalities and identities into debates as well
 saanskrithik rashtrawaad or udaaravaadeevaadi loktantr kii bahes ko bharat ke rajnatik samaaj kii astitvvaadi bahes kaha ja saktaa he lekin kya fark padataa he
 The living communities have created such debates in the world and have taken out paths from them
 ek departmental store main kaam karne vaali rojaa parks ne 1955 main shwet logon ke liye arakshit bas seat chhodie se inkaar karte hue jo bahes shuru kii thi, vah america samaaj ke astitv se judi thi lekin 1964 main america civil ritis act isi vimarsh se niklaa or america samaaj ne apane tamaam antarnihit vibhaajanon ke baavjood rangabhed se mukti ko sweekaar kiya
 In the last century, did Europe not have a long debate over dissolving its ethnic, nationalist and economic sovereignties and did not form a European Union
 europe ke liye yah faisla aasaan nahin tha
 Today, if Britain wants to break away from the European Union, then its path has been searched in the public mind, because Britain has a strong constitution and a conscious public who can handle such existential debates
 tikhi virodhpurna asahmatiyon ko deshadroh maanane vaale yah bhul jate hai ki bharat ke paas sanyog se ek aadhunik samvidhan he
 Open debates ranging from Punjab to north-east separatism were held in the shadow of this constitution
 ye bahasein haragij niraapad nahin thim
 They suffered, but a capable country with all its awareness lived that pain and gave the debates a chance to settle on a consensus
 hamane haal main hi vidhayika or nyaaypalika ke adhikaron (jajon kii niyukti) par bahes khatm kii he jisamen adaalat or sarkaar ne ek duusare kii kam cheer-faad nahin kii thi
 This is the most opportune time for the debate of nationalism versus liberal democracy, because the party has come to power from an ideology that disagrees with at least some of the core values of Indian democracy
 duusari taraf udaaravaadi loktantr ke samarthakon kaa samooh he jisane lambey samay tak satta main rahete hue badi bahason main kabhi duusare paksh ko sammanit jagah nahin di
 Therefore, if there is a vigilant debate, then the parties involved will have adequate logistic of experiences, history and references
 rashtrawaad or udaaravaadi loktantr kii is bahes main hamen bas, yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki satta isse nirpeksh rahe kyonki vyavastha kaa koi rashtrawaad nahin hota
 If this debate arises spontaneously from the society (not the designation) then perhaps we will be more beneficial
 udaaravaadi loktantr bharat kii sabase badi antarrashtriya pahchaan he jo ise china, rus jaise samakakshon se alag karti he
 Therefore, we have to conduct the debate in such a way that we do not injure our international image until we reach a conclusion
 bharat main hameshaa se satta, samaaj ke saamne kamjor rahi he
 Francis Fukuyama (the Origins of Political Order) rightly writes that political power in India has never been more relevant than a threshold in the lives of ordinary people whereas social forces in China have always been weak in front of the power of power
 is bahes ke bhagidaaron ko yah dhyaan rakhana hoga ki rashtrawaad antat kisi nasl, jati yaa satta kii takat main jaakar kendrit hota he or yah uske pratikon se hi prakat hota he
 Under the pretext of this debate of nationalism and liberal democracy, what is the harm if the society of India wants to re-examine the achievements and confounds of its power
 faisla kuch bhi ho lekin bahes ke jariye hamen kam se kam yah to pataa chalegaa ki bharat ko lekar donon khemon ke vyavaharik rajnatik dizin kya hai
 We should once decide what India wants for itself, a young, educated and aware India of the twenty-first century, leaving conspiracies on ideological issues
 use kitna rashtrawaad, kitna udaarvaad, kaisaa loktantr, kis tarah ke pratik, kaisaa samaaj, kisi arthvyavastha chahie

 railway board main do sachivalay sambandhi sevaaon main pramotion main badi aniyamitata saamne ai he
 Official sources said that some officials of the Ministry of Railways were involved in two lesser-known services of the Railways - the Railway Board Secretariat Service (RBSS) and the Railway Board Secretariat Clerical Service (RBSCS) without following due process and neglecting the jurisdiction of the cabinet officials
 Have been found to be promoting
 unhone kaha ki adhikariyon ko seva ke nunatam 16 saal ke anubhav ke maanak ko puraa kiye bina indian railway sarvice of maikenical ejeeniyar (iaresaimai), indian railway personal sarvice (aiarpies) or yahaan tak ki iees jaisi group ‘e’ kii railway sevaaon kii upeksha kar ucch prashasnic grad (echegi) or varisht prashasnic grad (esaiji) main padonnat kiya ja rahaa he
 HAG and SAG are given an additional secretary and joint secretary level officer respectively
 sutron ne bataaya ki vartmaan main saamaanya taur kendriya sachivalay seva (siesas) se taalluk rakhane vaale kisi adhikari ko seva ke 23 saal puure karne ke baad esaiji diya jaataa he, group e ke railway seva adhikari ko seva ke 23 saal baad or iees adhikari ko seva ke 20 saal baad
 He said that many officers in the RBSS are being given SAG grade without meeting the necessary requirements, while they were recruited in Group 'B' service
 ise ek ‘‘gambhir galati’’ qaraar dete hue vitt mantralay ne haal main railway ko likhaa he ki vah in adhikariyon ko padonnat karne ke apane faisle ko radd kare jiske liye lagbhag ek saal pehle aadesh jari kiye gaye the
 The Department of Expenditure under the Ministry of Finance noted that "while reorganizing the cadres of RBSS and RBSCS, the Ministry of Railways did not send the matter to this department for approval and in turn created five additional SAG level posts without the approval of the Cabinet"
 '
 isane railway ko likhe kade shabdon vaale aadhikarik patrak main kaha, ‘‘yah nirnay lene vaale praadhikari ke samaksh tathyaatmak sthiti or niyam evam shart rakhane ke jimmedaar adhikariyon kii ore se ek gambhir khami he’’
 According to the rules, to create posts below SAG level, the approval of the Union Cabinet is necessary to create Finance Minister and Joint Secretary above level and other posts
 sandesh main kaha gaya, ‘‘yah ullekh karnaa upyukt hoga ki cader samiksha main vittiya jatiltaayen hoti hai jiske liye vyay vibhaag (dioi) se sahmati lenaa aavashyak hota he
 The Railway Board has also been made aware of this in the past
 ’’ dioi ne duusare udhaaharan kaa ullekh kiya jisamen railway board ne rail mantralay main group si or gru di karmiyon ke in-house cader punargathan kii prakriya ke liye isaki sahmati maangi he
 The message said that while approving the in-house cadre reorganization of Group c personnel, "the Ministry of Railways was explicitly told that cadre reviews of Group a and Group b services were continuously sent to this Ministry
" ’’ yah ullekh karnaa upyukt hoga ki arabses or arabssies ke ye adhikari railway main group e ke cader prabandhan ke liye jimmedaar hai

 During this, he spoke on the anger of Dalits and on the issue of Ambedkar
 desh main daliton kii naaraazgi ke ek sawaal par paswan ne kaha, “dalit kaa gussa swaabhaavik he
 There is a fundamental difference between our generation and Chirag Paswan's generation
 hamaari janareshan ke log the, jinhone julm ko sah liya or gaali ko sun liya, lekin jo nai janareshan ke log hai, wo izzat or sammaan kii jindagi jeena chaahate hai
 They may break, but are not willing to bow down
 aazaadee ke baad se jaise-jaise vakt guzar rahaa he, baba sahab ambedkar ke vichaar mukhar hokar saamne aa rahe hai
 He said that the reason for the displeasure of Dalits is also that we are not able to put our point in the right way
 logon tak nahin pahunchaa pate hai
 Because our men are Dalit class people, they are still very backward
 unako baar-baar samajhane kii jarurat hoti he ki hamane tumhaare liye kya kiya? udhaaharan ke liye oona main or jhajjar main ghatnaayen ghatin, jhajjar main thane ke saamne 5 daliton ko jinda jala diya gaya

 ye sari kii sari chizein huin, lekin ham inhen dhang se bataa nahin pate hai, nateeja ye hota he ki impressant thik se ja nahin paata he
 "when he was asked the question that your voice is not strongly heard on such issues? So he said, "as far as the case of the Dalit Act is concerned, when it was made, we were ministers and VP Singh's government was in 1989

 If Narendra Modi's government came, then (act) came into force from 26 January 2016, then it had 47 points instead of 22

 He said that it was in the section that if there is an FIR against anyone, then there will be arrest

 haalanki hamane ise samvidhan kii dhara 15(4) ke tahat banaaya tha, jisamen anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke liye special provijan kii aavashyaktaa he, to kanoon bana sakate hai
 When he was asked, why was the Modi government delayed in filing the review petition? In response, Paswan said, "now the court said that there will be no jail, so why was anger on our (government)?" Anger was against the Judgment of the Court
 hamen bhi aakrosh tha, isliye hamaari party se chiraagpaswaanne turant rivyuu petishan daakhil kiya
 He said that after this we met the Prime Minister
 is par piem modi ne kaha ki rivyuu petishan ham log daayar karenge
 Meanwhile, a six-day holiday has passed, but we recognize that if the law ministry and the department were active, there would be no problem
 sabko ek hi saath baitaakar, bajaae ki kaagaj yahaan se vahaan jaataa, file vahaan se yahaan aae, nirnay le saktaa tha kyonki sarkaar ne to nirnay le liya tha
 Are you in favor of the ordinance even after hearing the court's stand? Paswanaka, the head of this otherworldly Janashakti Party, used to say, "what will be the judgment of the court, it is not in our hands
" lekin haa, ham ghoshnaa karte hai sarkaar kii taraf se, kyonki piem ne hai power cameti banaai thi, hamane ye nirnay le liya he
 Court should think seriously and even if it is not done then we will bring ordinance

 ghatnakram ko ricriet karegi pulicerimand par lene ke baad police asaram ko madi ashram le gai
 According to the minor, Asaram sexually abused her right there
 bataaya jaataa he ki police asaram se poochtacha ke saath puure ghatnakram ko ricriet karegi or aaropon kii sachai jaanane kii koshish karegi
 In fact, Asaram had been running from here to there to avoid police interrogation
 lekin ab baapu kahin bhi nahin bhaag paaenge or naa hi apni koi nai lila dikhaa paaenge
 Now whatever leela has to be shown, the police will show it
 ab ye dekhne vaali baat he ki police baapu ko apni koun sa rup dikhaati he
 Now Bapu can show whatever he wants and whatever he wants, but at the moment he will have to face a plethora of police questions
 or shaayad isiilie asaram kii bolti band he
 Asked these questions to Asaram, the police questioned Rasa's guest house for 4 hours
 is dauraan police ne baapu se un lage yon shoshan ke aaropon ke bare main kai sawaal puche
 Read here what were these questions and what answers did Saram give to the police
 police- aapke paas ye ladki kaise pahunchi?asaram- iskaa parivaar hamaara sevak he
 The girl came for treatment
 police- jodhpur ashram ke bajaay madi kutiyaa main kyo bulaayaa tha?asaram- parivaar ne hamase kutiyaa dekhne kii ichha jataai thi
 Police - Why took the girl alone in the room? Asaram - The girl insisted on seeing the hut from inside
 mere alaava vahaan koi nahin jaataa
 He expressed the desire to listen to the religion
 ilsi vajah se vale gaya
 Police - What was the girl doing in the room for one and a half hours? Asaram - The girl was of religious instinct
 dharm karm kii baaten kar rahi thi
 Other than that, there is nothing
 police- ladki ne aap par iljaam kyon lagaaya?asaram- main arompon kaa jawaab nahin duungaa
 All allegations are false
 ladki meri potee samaan hai
 According to the police, Asaram is now cooperating in the investigation
 vaise aane vaale din asaram ke liye or bhi pareshaani bhare ho sakate hai kyonki agar police tafteesh main yon shoshan kii tasdik ho gai to baapu ko jail jane se koi nahin bachaa paaegaa
 Once the smugglers were Asaram from Asauram Sirumalani
 jis shaks ko ham or aap asaram baapu ke taur par jaanate hai wo kabhi sharaab ke taskar the
 It is difficult to believe but Asaram is accused of smuggling liquor during liquor ban in Gujarat and then started walking on the path of spirituality in the company of Vrindavan's Leelasha Ji Maharaj
 kuch baras pehle tak duniya asaram ko sirf isi rup main jaanati thi
 a spiritual master, as a saint
 kuch mehnat, kuch jhansa, kuch paakhand to kuch kismat ke dam par asaram is mukaam par pahunche the
 For the whole story, we go into a little flashback
 taarikh- 17 april 1941jagah- avibhajit bharat ke sindh praant kaa beraani gaanvek saadhaaran parivaar main janme the asaram, unka asli naam tha- asuram sirumalanibantwaare ke baad aasuram sirumalani kaa parivaar gujarat ke ahmedababad main aa gaya tha
 It is alleged that Asaram started his career as a liquor smuggler
 gujarat main sharaab bandi thi
 And Asaram used to earn good money by selling country liquor illegally
 22 saal kii umr main asaram kii mulaakaat unke guru swami lilashah maharaj se hui
 In his company, Asaram was obsessed with walking on the path of devotion
 kamai badi to 1972 main asaram ne ahmedabad main pehla ashram sthapit kiya
 Asaram used to call himself a saint on the one hand, on the other he also had a good family
 unhone lakshmi devi naam kii mahila se shaadi kii, jinase ek beti or ek bete narayan swami kaa janm hua
 In India, the business of religion used to be very sharp
 asaram kaa bhi dhandha chal niklaa
 Asaram's magic went on the devotees
 dekhte dekhte unke bhakton kii taadaat karodon main pahunch gai
 As on date, Asaram's trust has a total of 425 ashrams
 unhone 17 sau bal sanskaar centre or 50 rihaayshi skool bhi khulwaaye hai
 Asaram also included Ayurveda in the business of religion
 ayurvedic dawaaon kaa unka bijness bhi chal niklaa
 Babagiri was doing well, but who knew that there would be a ruckus in the midst of Babagiri
 asaram ek, iljaam hajaar
 
 
 Even if there was a single blemish of stigma on Asaram's white dress, it was a privilege
 lekin ab to iljaamon ke chalate puraa kaa puraa safed chola hi kaala dikhne laga he
 And in this soot sexual abuse, captivating, hypnosis, kidnapping

 tab 18 july ko vahaan grih mantralay ke 2 afasar aae or maan kii jaankaree ikatthi kerani chaahi
 2
 afasaron ne poocha kibhagwant maan yahaan kyon aae, kitne din tehre, kya ilaaj chalaa, kis-kis se mili
 On 19 July, they came again to the health center and tried to gather information
 aatankwaadi nahin hai bhagwant maanam aadmi party kaa daawa he ki ye jasusi modi sarkaar ke kehane par hui
 AAP leader Ashutosh said that Bhagwant Mann is not a terrorist
 na koi chori kii he or na unase suraksha kaa hi koi khatra he
 If Bhagwant Mann is going into his personal life, then why was the Modi government spying there? jis mohabbat kii usne araju kii thi, jis mohabbat se wo apni jindagi roshan karnaa chahta tha, jo uske geeton main dhadkta tha
 Which was tinkering with his dreams
 vahi mohabbat uski maut kaa paigaam ban gai
 Whether you call it horror killing, honor killing or love jihad, what happened in Delhi's Khyala
 naam chaahe jo de dijie lekin hakeekat main ye ek soch he jo duusare majahab se mohabbat ko paap samajhakar khatm karne par tul jaati he
 Punishment for love of non-religion: 23-year-old Ankit's fetters put a death knell on his life, he was punished for loving a non-religious girl
 use dilli main bich sadak par, tamashbin bheed ke bich maar daalaa gaya
 Now neither is Ankit, nor is he in love
 bas majahabi chadar odhane vaale chand shaitan hai or wo maa-baap hai jiske saamne unke bete kosja-e-mohabbatadi gai
 The only lamp of the house was Ankit Ankit's mother's sigh, now never ending
 iklauta betaatha ankit
 Neither second brother nor second sister
 apni maa se bepanaah pyaar karne vaala betaa apane pita or parivaar kii puri jimmedaari apane kandhon par lene kii baat karata tha
 Your soul will tremble wondering what will be happening at this time to this mother who sees the life of a young son slipping from his hands
 or dil ke marij is pita ke dil par kya biit rahaa hoga jisane maut ko parinde kii tarah palak jhapakate beti kii jindagi jhapatate dekha
 Thursday night's bloody incident in Khyala in West Delhi is not just a case of murder, a murder of love, of a mother's mother, and the expectations of her father
 lekin ye usase kahin zyada us majahab kii bhi hatya he jise akit ke hatyaron ne apni dakiyanusi soch se daagdar kar diya
 Think of the fear of family due to daughter's fear, in order to marry the daughter in her religion, parents and mama-brothers all committed the crime of murder
 wo beti ab apane ghar kii bajaay celter house main rahanaa chaahati he
 She has stood openly against the thought of cutting throat
 lekin laanat he us bheed par jo ek noujvaan ko marate dekhati rahi or madad kaa haath badhaane kii himmat nahin kar saki
 Actually Khyala is not in any rugged, not in any desert, not in Syria or Afghanistan
 khyala dilli main he
 Which is the capital of the world's largest democracy and where the constitution calls for secularism
 usee dilli main gaiyr majahab kii ladki se mohabbat karne par ek ladke kii hatya ho jaati he
 Ankit's father's big accusation was that the girl's family members were very angry at the love of the boy
 isi naaraazgi main wo ankit ke ghar pahunche or bahes shuru ho gai
 The debate escalated to a fight, the girl's mother, maternal uncle, father and minor brother scrambled up to Ankit's mother
 ankit ke pita bataate hai ki hatyare hatya kii puri taiyaari karke aae the
 Ankit's parents say that if the reason for the murder was love for the girl of another religion, then they have no idea about it, the father's question is - if the rivalry was only about love then the girl's family would come to them, talk to them do
 bindaas noujvaan tha ankitankit 23 saal kaa bindaas noujvaan tha
 Was living his life in his style
 photography karata tha, guitar bajaata tha
 Was fond of acting and modeling
 tamaam bade actor or cricketron ke saath usne tasviren khinchvaa rakhi thi
 She had a Facebook page called Awara Boy
 lekin wo duusare majahab kii ladki se mohabbat ke khatre se anjaan tha or isse bhi ki jis din uski jaan par ban aegi, log dur se uski barbaadi kaa tamaasha dekhte rahenge
 The police have arrested the accused of killing Ankit
 aropiyon ke ghar par taale latak rahe hai
 But you and we also know what the people of Ankit's family may have to face till justice is done
 ankit ko maarane vaale majahab ke mureed nahin ho sakate, wo sirf hatyare hai
 Religion is a mask for them
 ladki ke ghar waalon ne us soch kii hatya kar di jo mohabbat ko majahab kii buniyaad maanati he
 What is a religion without love? ek khokhli cheez, ek tang najariya
 a blind eye or madness
 ankit kii hatya ne phir sabit kar diya
 If you do not understand the religion properly then it becomes an epidemic

 5 Artists: Harman Baweja, Sunny Deol and Ayesha Khannadirector: Sanamjit Singh Talwar Bollywood is trending that some Friday drought and some Friday floods
 pichley kuch dinon se aisa hi chal rahaa he
 This week also three films have knocked together at the box office
 yangistan, o teri or dhishkiaun relies ho gai hai
 Shilpa Shetty from Dishkiaon is present in front of the audience as a producer
 sani deol or harman baveja ek saath acshan karte najar aa rahe hai
 Of course, box office success matters a lot for Harman, but Dhishkiyaan is not the film that can regain his footing in Bollywood
 haalanki film main ve ausat lage hai
 Sahara in the form of Sunny Deol also does not take him much further
 film kaa kharaab mujeec or bojhil treetment bhi koi ummid nahin jagaata he
 Sanamjit Singh Talwar's direction is also weak
 kahani main kitna damaviki (harman) kaa bachapan mushkilon bharaa rahaa he
 The mother was not able to get that kind of support from her father and used to get very angry in school
 is tarah vah aparaadh kii daldal main dhansata jaataa he
 Just then the usual story of the underworld begins
 kamjor kahani film ko bojhil bana detii he
 Neither the dialogue is fun nor the action forces the fingers to press under the teeth
 sab kuch ausat se bhi kamatar he
 Star Appelharaman Baweja was last seen in What's Your Zodiac in 2009
 film kaa box offis par bura hashr hua tha
 But this film also does not raise any special expectations for him
 acting ke maamle main unhone kuch bhi ullekhneey nahin kiya he
 Sunny Deol accumulates, but the film is not his own
 produsar shilpa shetty ne item sang karke kuch koshish kii lekin usamen aisa kuch bhi nahin he, jo aah bharne ke liye majubar kare
 The new heroine Ayesha Khanna also does not bring warmth in the film
 kamai kii baatis hafte teen filmein relies ho rahi hai
 In such a situation, Dhishkiyaun faces the comedy o Teri and the political drama Youngistan
 jis tarah kii film kii kahani he or youth ko apni ore khinchne vaala koi factor nahin he, uske chalate film se kuch zyada ummiden nahin he
 If a miracle happens, there is no point, but there is nothing in the film that can be remembered

 mumbai gangrape main shaamil ek ladkaa umr se naaballig he
 NDTV received his certificate which was issued at the time of his birth
 iske mutabik vah naaballig he
 This certificate is questioning the claims of the police
 police kamishnar ne media se kaha tha ki sabhi aaropee balig he
 However, now this certificate has been received from BMC which states that an accused was born on 26 February 1997
 yani vah 18 saal se kam he
 The comments police gangrape kii tafteesh kis tarah kar rahi he uskaa ye bada namoona he
 The police did not even bother to get the records removed from BMC
 ab kah rahi he haddi kii jaanch se umr tay karegi
 This question is also big because a minor was involved in the Delhi gang rape and after this there is a continuous debate that now the age limit should be reduced in crime
 agar mumbai police ek shaks ko balig sabit karne main naakaamayaab ho jaati he to phir iskaa cese alag se chalegaa or ye jald hi jail se baahar hoga
 The police commissioner had told the media that all the accused were adult
 lekin, ab ye certificate biemasi se mila he jo bataa rahaa he ki ek aaropee 26 farvari 1997 ko paidaa hua
 That is, he is under 18 years
 tippaniyan This is a big example of how the police is investigating gang rape
 police ne yah jahamat bhi nahin uthaai ki biemasi se record nikalwaaye
 Now saying that the age will be determined by examining the bone
 ye sawaal isaliye bhi bada he kyonki dilli gangrape main ek naaballig shaamil tha or iske baad lagaataar ek bahes chal rahi he ki ab aparaadh main umr seemaa kam dena chahie
 If the Mumbai police fails to prove a person to be an adult, then its case will run separately and it will be out of jail soon
 police gangrape kii tafteesh kis tarah kar rahi he uskaa ye bada namoona he

 bhartiya vaayu sena ke ucch sutron ne is baat kii pushti kar di he ki 27 farvari ko wing commander abhinandan vartmaan ne hi pakistan ke ladaaku vimaan epa-16 ko maar giraaya tha
 Abhinandan used the R-73 missile to target the F-16
 amaram missile se mig 21 bison ko nishaanaa banaae jane se pehle abhinandan ne yah waar kiya tha
 This makes it clear that Pakistan used the F-16 during this period
 bhartiya vaayu sena (IAF) ke sutron ne india today tivi ko bataaya ki abhinandan ne hi hawaii hamale ke dauraan pakistan ke ladaaku vimaan par missile daagi thi
 Abhinandan, in his last radio transmission before being targeted by the Pakistani Air Force, confirmed that he had fired the missile
 is bich, bhartiya vaayu sena ne bhi pakistan ke F-16 ko giraaye jane ke sambandh main soshal media par failaai ja rahi galat soochnaaon ko lekar spashtikaran jari kiya he
 The IAF said that on 28 February 2019, it was issued a statement that the mig-21 bison had killed and killed the Pakistan F-16
 bhartiya vayusena ne yah bhi saaf kiya ki wing commander abhinandan soshal media par sakriy nahin hai
 He does not have an account on Twitter and Instagram
 lihaaja aise farji acount ko follow na karen
 The IAF has advised to be careful with this
 bataa den ki pakistan ne hawaii karrwai ke dauraan bhartiya vaayu sena ke wing commander abhinandan ko pakistan ne pakad liya tha, lekin kootnithik dabaav ke chalate usne teen din ke bheetar hi unhen reeha kar diya tha
 Abhinandan's valor was appreciated nationwide
 unki desh vaapasi ke dauraan khub josh ke saath unka swaagat kiya gaya
 Abhinandan underwent a medical checkup after his return and is currently resting
 mig 21 bison ke girane kii vajah se unhen qamar main chotein bhi ai thim
 Air Force Chief BS Dhanoa has also stated earlier that the mig-21 Bison is a capable aircraft, it has been upgraded
 isamen behatar radar, hawa se hawa main missile daagne or behatar hathiyaar pranali he
 a planned operation is where you plan and move your fighter jet
 lekin jab koi aap par hamalaa karata he, to aap uskaa turant jawaab dete hai, chaahe us samay aapke paas koi bhi fiter jet maujuud ho
 All our fighter aircraft are capable of fighting the enemy
 baharhaal, in ghatnakramon ke bich bharat or pakistan ke bich abhi bhi tanaavpurn sthiti bani hui he
 40 soldiers were killed in a suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir

 Many countries around the world including the US criticized Pakistan and expressed support for India
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar jo rajya ke grahamantri bhi hai, buudhvaar ko aresas netaaon ke sambandh main jaankaree jutaney ke apane grih vibhaag ke ek aadesh kaa media ke saamne bachaav nahin kar paae
 Rajiv Ranjan, the then SP of the Special Branch of Bihar Police, a few days after the Lok Sabha elections, had sought a report from the DSP of his department about the leaders and office bearers of 19 organizations of the RSS
 is report kii copy jab media ke haath lag gai to nitish kumaar kii sarkaar kuch ghante bhi iskaa bachaav nahin kar pai
 On Wednesday morning, however, the state's information minister Neeraj Kumar had poured water on the entire matter, calling it a routine report, but as soon as the bjp's Legislative Councilor Sanjay Mayukh picked up inside the Bihar Legislative Council and demanded an inquiry into the leak in the media After that, the government came under Damage Control
 lekin is vivaad ke baad jahaan tay mana ja rahaa he ki isse nitish or RSS ke bich avishvaas kaa bhav or adhik badhegaa
 At the same time, the way the ADG of the Special Branch, Jitendra Singh Gangwar, did away with the damage control from the press conference, especially about the image of the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, people started to tell the suppressed tongue that under pressure, they asked the SP to clarify the morale of their own officers
 Has dropped samvaadadaata sammelan main gangavar ne is espi dwaara jari circular kaa auchity yah bataaya ki kuch khufia jaankaree thi ki RSS ke netaaon par kuch khatara he isliye sari jaankaree jutai ja rahi thi
 On the other hand, when asked for clarification from the SP, he had no clear answer
 gangavar bhi saafe saafe dabaav main dikh rahe the
 He was completely unsuccessful in satisfying the reporters with his answers
 samvaadadaata sammelan ke baad atakalon kaa bazaar garm ho gaya, or saafe he ki is mudde par nitish kumaar bachaav kii mudra main hai
 The BJP may or may not have any pressure, but their pressure was more on the police officers under their own and it seemed that in their quest to save their government, they once again did not care that the explanation from their officer for a routine work By asking, they are giving birth to a wrong tradition
 haalanki haal ke dinon main aisi kai ghatnaayen hui hai jisase nitish kumaar ke samarthak bhi maanate hai ki raajnneeti yaa apane aasapaas ke logon ke dabaav main unhone police adhikariyon ke manobal ko todane vaale qadam uthaae hai
 The most recent example was the transfer of the SP of Lakhisarai and the Rural SP of Patna immediately after the election, that these officials refused to work when Nitish Kumar's close Lalan Singh was a candidate for the Lok Sabha elections from Munger
 usee tarah chunaav ke bichon-bich nitish kumaar ne do IPS adhikariyon, jisamen mujaffarpur ke purv SP vivek kumaar shaamil hai, kaa nilamban waapas karke unhen phir se padasthapit kar diya
 On Vivek, during his tenure in Muzaffarpur, a case was registered by the Special Monitoring Department of the Government of Bihar itself, with liquor mafia having lumps and disproportionate assets
 lekin bihar police ke varisht adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki dhire-dhire nitish kumaar apane nirnay or aadesh se raajnneetik majaburi ke kaaran police adhikariyon kaa manobal ooncha rakhane main apane se fail ho rahe hai
 Employers can get a big deal soon under GST

 isamen jiesti ritern file karne ke naye norms, reverse charge maikenism main badlaav, alag-alag vertical kii companiyon kaa registration bhi alag-alag karne samet anya prastaav shaamil hai

 iske alaava sanshodhan menoutdoor cataring, beauty treetment,cosmetic or plastic surgery,aircraft kii rinting samet kai anya sevaaon par input tex credit kaa phayda nahin milegaa
 The central government has asked all shareholders to express their views on these proposed amendments
 isaki khatir unhen 15 july tak kaa vakt diya gaya he

 indira gandhi kii is tasviir ke bare main pataa nahin kab or kis ghatana kii he, lekin yah sach he ki 1977 main satta se baahar rahane ke dauraan indira gandhi ne bihar ke ek gaanv belchi main hue daliton ke narsanhaar ke baad peediton se milane pahunchi thim
 11 Dalits were killed in this massacre
 indira gandhi 13 agast 1977 ko narsanhaar ke peediton se milane ke liye belchi pahunchi thim, jahaan baadh jaise halaat the
 At that time, due to the flood, Indira Gandhi had to reach Elephant village in Belchi
 indira gandhi peedit pariwaron se milin or unhen dhankos badhaayaa
 It is said that it was only after the visit of Belchi that Indira Gandhi's return to power began
 apni kitaab 'ol da prime ministars main' main patrkaar janardan thakur ne is ghatana kaa zikr kiya he
 Indira Gandhi, who reached Belchi in August 1977, also wrote on the visit of Indira Gandhi to Belchi, who was a reporter in the Times of India
 hemendra narayan likhte hai, ''13 agast 1977 ko indira gandhi kaa hathi par chadhakar belchi aane ke baad kai tarah kii kahaniyaan hai
 In most of the stories, this sentiment is appreciated by the Dalits
 indira gandhi apatkaal ke baad hue aam chunaav main apni haar ke baad belchi pahunchi thim
 'he writes that,' when she alighted from the plane, she was much more powerful
 rimjhim barish ho rahi thi or indira gandhi ek gulabi rang kaa renkot pahan kar neeche utrin
 People with him were getting wet even without wanting
 unhen belchi janaa tha
 In Belchi, 11 people were brutally murdered, including an innocent child
 airport par unhone ghoshnaa kii ki "main yahaan mrit logon ke parijanon se apni samvednaa vyakt karne ai hum
 "despite all the hurdles, she was adamant on going to Belchi
 ’belchi gaanv patna jile kii seemaa par basaa he or aajkal yah nalanda jile main aata he
 The village falls 13 kilometers on the harnaut-saksohra road
 harnaut tak rajmarg ke jariye aasaani se pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 Hemendra Narayan writes, 'then there was a flood
 gaanv ke chaaron taraf barish kaa pani bharaa hua tha
 Indira Gandhi got out of the first jeep, but the jeep got stuck in the mud
 jeep ko tractor se khinchakar nikaalane kii jugat kii gai, lekin kaam nahin aayaa
 She got down and started walking
 unke saath bihar congress ke kai saare netaa bhi nange paanv chal rahe the or jaisaa ki hona hi tha zyada der nahin chal sake
 Then it was decided that there could be no other means other than elephants
 ’indira gandhi ke saath dilli se hi purv saansad pratibha singh bhi thim
 Indira Gandhi climbed the elephant 'moti' in Narayanpur village before the Mohane River
 pratibha singh ne unhen chadhaane main madad kii
 The river was full of water, but the elephant had no difficulty in crossing it
 baaki log ek naav se paar hue
 Hemendra Narayan states that Indira Gandhi expressed a desire to see the place where people were murdered
 vah jagah gaanv ke kinare makke ke kheton ke bich thi
 To reach the place surrounded by bamboos, elephants were taken into the fields
 vahaan us samay tak mritkon kii adhajali haddiyaan padi thim
 The guerrillas prepared funeral pyre before his assassination and then shot the Dalits in line
 hemendra narayan ke mutabik belchi main daliton kaa narsanhaar bihar main koi pehali ghatana nahin thi

 Four-hour marathon inquiry
 ek or purv kendriya mantri shashi tharur to duusari ore chaar police adhikari
 Long list of questions one after another
 tharur poochtacha ke baad baahar nikle to chehre par chintaa kii rekhaaen thim
 But is the fact that the case of Sunanda Pushkar murder case will be solved by this inquiry
 kamaal dekhie ek saal pehle thik 19 janvari ko hi pehali baar shashi tharur se apni bivi sunanda pushkar kii maut ko lekar sawaal puche gaye the
 a year later, on the same January 19, Shashi Tharoor is again asked questions about his wife's death
 lekin 10 aise naam hai, jinase pataa chal saktaa he koun he sunanda kaa kaatil!pataa nahin ise ittefaq kahenge yaa taarikh kaa pher
 The wheel rotates 365 days a year, and then after a whole year, on the same date, as soon as Hashishi Tharoor is again in the circle of questions
 lagbhag unheen sawaalon ke jo thik saal bhar pehle puche gaye the or ab saal bhar baad phir se puche gaye
 Yes, the place of inquiry was different
 chehre alag the
 The SDM was then questioned, now the SIT team formed to investigate the case was being questioned
 baaki jahaan tak sunanda kii maut kaa sawaal he to wo tab bhi andhere main tha ab bhi andhere main he
 a year later, when the Delhi Police registered the case in 302 i
e
 Murder to find out the secret of Sunanda's death and a new team was formed for investigation
 poochtacha kii rasm nibhaani thi so 19 janvari ko wo bhi nibhaa lee gai
 Because the reality is that in the year, the case has not moved even an inch
 saal bhar pehle bhi shashi tharur se pakistani patrkaar meher tarara ke saath rishte, sunanda ke saath jhagada, marpet, chot ke pandrah nishaan, beemaari kii galat jaankaree dena, bina parchi ke dawa dena, ipel ke saath taar jodna, 15 se 17 janvari kii kadiyaan jodna, jaise sawaal hi puche gaye the
 Questioners regarding the timing of inquiries are also raising questions about the timing of inquiries
 sawaal ye ki jab dhara badalane ke alaava cese main kuch nayaa hua hi nahin to acha hota ki police pehle us visra report ke aane kaa intjaar karti jo jehar kii kism or jehar kii maatra kakhulasakarne vaali he
 When Shashi Tharoor was questioned, new things could come out
 sunanda pushkar kii maut ke maamle main shashi tharur ne takreeban chaar ghante kii marathon poochtacha beshak kamyaabi se paar kar lee
 But if the sources of the Special Investigation Team, ie SIT, who surrounded Tharoor with their questions, believe that despite such a long questioning, they did not get answers to many such questions from Tharoor that they wanted to know
 sutron ke mutabik sawaalon ke saare sire shashi tharur or pakistani patrkaar meher taraar ke rishton or us rishte ko lekar miyaan-bivi main hone vaali anban ke ird-gird hi khul rahe the
 That is, the police was assuming that if Sunanda was killed, then the cause of this murder was the relationship of Shashi Tharoor and Meher Tarar
 magar iske saath hi police ipel ko bhi is cese se jod kar dekh rahi thi lihaaja duusari ahm vajah uski nigaah main ipel or mani londring thi
 Rajtherur admitted that there was a fight between him and Sunanda
 lekin unhone is baat se inkaar kar diya ki maut se pehle sunanda ke saath unki koi marpet hui thi
 While the reality is that Sunanda's body had a total of 15 marks of injury
 aise main ye sawaal ansulajhaa hi rah gaya ki aakhir sunanda ko itani chotein kahaan se or kaise lageen?katl kaa raajpulice sunanda kii maut ko beshak katl kaa maamla maan kar tafteesh kar rahi he, lekin tharur ab bhi ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin the ki kisi ne sunanda kaa katl kiya hoga
 The question of the police was whether Sunanda had been injected by anyone before the death or did anyone suspect Tharoor? In response, Tharoor said that he feels that Sunanda has died a common death
 neend kii goliyon kaa razeb tak saamne ai jaankaree ke mutabik sunanda kaa ilaaj karanevaale kisi bhi doctor ne unhen neend kii goliyaan khaane kii salaah nahin thi
 Despite this, after Sunanda's death, two empty strips of Alprax tablets were recovered from his room in the hotel
 ye strip sunanda ke kamare main kahaan se aae, iskaa bhi koi saaf jawaab tharur nahin de sake
 Rajherur of Meher admitted that Mehr Tararse, a Pakistani journalist, had differences with his Sunanda over their relationship
 lekin ye maanane se inkaar kar diya ki taraar se unke koi bahut kareebi rishte the
 In such a situation, when the police asked the reason for the rift, Tharoor said that Sunanda might have been suspicious of them due to both being active in social media
 sach chhipaane kaa rajtherur ne sunanda kii maut ke baad esadm kii ore se kii gai pehali poochtacha main apane or sunanda ke darmyaan kisi tarah kii koi pareshaani nahin hone kii baat kahi thi
 But later, Tharoor's servant himself had told that there were frequent quarrels between Tharoor and Sunanda
 aise main esaiti ne tharur se esadm ko die gaye jawaab main jab sach chupaane kii vajah poochi, to bhi tharur ne koi saaf jawaab nahin de sake
 When Shashi Tharoor came to know for the first time that Sunanda had died, he had called the SHO of Sarojini Nagar police station instead of calling hundred
 police ko ye baat ajeeb lagi
 Similarly, the police also found it strange that when Tharoor was mailed to the panel of doctors of AIIMS when the matter is under investigation, Rajathur sent an e-mail to the doctors of AIIMS, sending Sunanda to Lupus The name was said to be a disease
 jabaki baad main doctoron ne bataaya ki sunanda ko aisi koi beemaari thi hi nahin
 Tharoor could not give a very clear and satisfactory answer to the question asked in this regard
 baahar hone kaa rajeshaiti ke adhikariyon ne unase sunanda kii maut ke dauraan unke eisisisi kii meeting main hone ko lekar bhi kai sawaal puche
 For example, how much time he spent there, when he got the news of Sunanda's health deteriorating, when he left from there
 or inhen lekar apane javaabon ke haq main police ne unase kuch subut bhi maange
 Sunanda's enmity with someone from Rajthurur, any conspiracy related to IPL or money laundering, whether or not there is news of Sunanda having a press conference, quarreling in a plane while coming to Delhi from Kerala and first separate in the same hotel Asked about things like staying in different rooms
 aspataal naa le jane kaa rajeshaiti ne sunanda kii tabiyat bigadane kii khabar saamne aane ke baavjood unhen aspataal naa le jaakar hotel main hi doctor ko bulaane kii vajah bhi tharur se jaanane kii koshish kii
 At the same time, he also asked, why did he keep waiting? Rajpolis asked not to make a PCR call, because Tharoor died due to Sunanda's mysterious condition, and asked why his staff did not Why did the police make a personal call? In response to this, Tharoor did what he understood then, as he said
 haalanki poochtacha ke dauraan tharur ne shant or normal dikhne kii puri koshish kii
 But after this interrogation, the SIT has neither given him any clean chit nor has indicated any involvement in his conspiracy
 lekin haa, ye jarur saaf kar diya ki jarurat padi to abhi kai or logon se poochtacha ho sakati he
 The police now want to reach both the motive and murder of Sunanda Pushkar as soon as possible
 lekin asli kaatil tak pahunchane se pehle use das aise logon se bhi milanaa he, jo kaatil kaa pataa bataane main madadgaar sabit ho sakate hai
 Who are those ten faces? Shashi Tharoor - Sunanda Pushkar's husband Menon - Sunanda's son Ashish Das - Sunanda's younger brother Rajesh Pushkar - Sunanda's younger brother Narayan Singh - Sunanda and Shashi's special servant: Bajrangi - Sunanda's driver Rajesh Kumar Sharma - Shashi Tharoor's PA Kumar Prasad - Sanjay Diwan, the then OSD Doctor of Shashi Tharoor - Counsel General of the Republic of Cape Verde and family friend of Sunanda, Nalini Singh - Senior Ptrkarye not name just one, but these are ten very important role for the Special Investigation Team of the Delhi Police, because Sunanda police investigation into the murder of Pushkar rests itself around these ten names
 inaki kahi gai ek ek baat police ke liye behad jaruri he, kyonki unheen baton kii aad main police ko sunanda pushkar kaa wo sach dhund nikaalnaa he, jo unki rahasyamai halaat main hui maut kaa asli pataa de sake
 However, the police has started investigating those people, whose names have come up in the conversations of these people
 jinamein kaity urf catherine abraham sabase ahm naam he, kyonki is naam kaa zikr apane bayaan main sunanda or shashi tharur ke naukar narayan ne jis tareeke se kiya, usko lekar police ke paas kai sawaal aakar khadey ho gaye or police bina un sawaalon ke jawaab hasil kiye aage badhane ke mood main nahin he

 The comments unhone kaha,aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki main congress se judane vaala hum
 It is far from the truth
 kisi or raajnneetik dal se judane kaa to sawaal hi nahin uthta
 This reaction of Yeddyurappa has come against the statements of some Congress leaders, in which they have spoken about Yeddyurappa coming to the Congress
 yediurppa kaa kahana he ki vah 30 may ko rajya kaa daura karke logon kii ichha janenge or tabhi apane bhavishya ke bare main koi sahi nirnay karenge

 Yeddyurappa says that he will know the will of the people by visiting the state on May 30 and only then will take a right decision about his future

 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghuvar Das has written a letter to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 is patr main unhone sharaab utpaadan ko protsaahit karne ko lekar bihar sarkaar dwaara liye gaye nirnay kii taraf dhyaan dilaate hue kaha he ki ek taraf bihar sarkaar ne sharabbandi lagu kii he, iske anupaalan ke liye sakht kanoon bhi banaaye hai
 On the other hand, contrary to the original sentiment, companies have been given tax holiday i
e
 tax concession to promote liquor production in Bihar
 darasal tex holiday kii vajah se sharaab kaa utpaadan sasta hoga
 Raghuvar Das has said that due to the decision of Bihar government, liquor companies will get an additional saving of seven crore rupees annually, while the same revenue will be lost to the Bihar government
 bihar main utpaadit sharaab, jise rajya se baahar niryaat or uske botling karne ke liye kar vimukti di gai he
 It will be sold in other states
 padosi hone ke kaaran jharkhand main bhi sasti sharaab kii bikri badhegi
 According to Das, there is a contradiction in both the decisions of the Bihar government
 unhonenithish kumarase kaha he ki jab aap duusare rajyon main jate hai, to vahaan bhi sharabbandi karne kii baat kehete hai
 At the same time, by producing cheap liquor in their state, they seek markets in other states including Jharkhand
 aise main is mudde par punarvichaar kar samuchit nirnay len, jo sharaab bandi kii disha main kargar ho sake
 Significantly, full prohibition is in force in Bihar
 jabaki bihar se jude jharkhand main yah lagu nahin he
 In such a situation, liquor is illegally reaching Bihar from Jharkhand
 nitish kumaar chaahate hai ki jharkhand main bhi purna sharabbandi lagu ho
 For this, he has also held meetings in cities like Dhanbad, Jamshedpur
 vahiin jaankaar maanate hai ki iske peeche darasal jharkhand main jediu ke liye rajanithik jameen talashna mukhya kaaran he
 In such a situation, when the issue of tax holiday comes to the fore, Raghuvar Das has retaliated and tried to show Nitish Kumar a mirror

 Sridevi Gunda explains that the problems related to the eyes increase greatly at this time
 diwali ke 15 din baad tak unke paas ankhon kii samasyaon se grasit log aate rahete hai
 These mainly cause problems such as red eyes, watery eyes and itchy eyes
 aajkal to vaayu itani pradooshit ho chuki he ki uskaa nakaaratmak prabhaav hamaari ankhon par bhi najar aane laga he

 ankhon main dryness, rednes, sensitivity aadi iske lakshan hai
 If you are having any such problem then immediately contact a good eye doctor
 gande haath se na chhuenham main se bahut se logon kii ye aadat hoti he ki jab bhi hamaari ankhon main kuch chalaa jaataa he yaa halki si bhi khujali hoti he to apni ankhen masalane lagate hai

 You can also add rose water to the eyes if you want
 mahatvapurn baat ye he ki ankhon main kisi bhi prakaar kii samasya hone par foraan doctor se sampark karen, kyonki ankhen behad najuk hoti hai
 In this case, the slightest carelessness with the eyes can get you in trouble

 Kohli said, he is the bowler who leads the team to victory
 jo bhi team acchhee gendbaaji karti he, vah jitati he
 Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin said teams would gradually get used to this rule
 unhone kaha, aap in niyamon ke antargat jitne adhik match khelenge, to aapako pataa chal jayega ki kya behatar lakshya hoga

 If you feel that your girlfriend does not spend much time with you, still avoiding you from having an 'official break up', then this is an alarming signal for you
 in paanch sanketon se jaane ki kya vaaki aapkigarlfriend aapkaa istemaal kar rahi he?1
 He would say repeatedly, 'I want space'
 If your friend remembers you when you are in trouble, consider yourself lucky
 uski madad bhi kariye
 But if he comes out of trouble, he starts ignoring you, reduces the conversation and the next resounding call comes only when he needs your help, then suppose you are nothing more than a tissue paper for him

 Friends with Extra Benefits
 
 
 aap jis ladki ko beintehaa pyaar karte hon, agar wo aapako public place main gale se laga le to ye samajhane kii bhul mat kar lijiega ki wo bhi aapako usee lagan se pyaar karti he
 Maybe you are just 'just Friend' for him
 is baat par gaur karen ki kya usne kabhi aapse aapke bare main apni feeling share kii he? ye bhi ho saktaa he ki wo apni sahuuliyat ke hisaab se aapako haq jamaane kaa mauka de rahi ho

 It is good that in time you should distance yourself from it

 Stop giving her 'benefit of doubt'
 If you feel that a girl is not giving you full rights despite being close to you, then first of all, find out if she is doing rebound dating with you? Maybe she has come close to you after a breakup from someone and it feels good to spend time with you
 agar aisa he to is baat kii puri gunjaaish he ki wo aapse pyaar nahin karti
 She can also be close to you because she wants to keep herself away from anyone
 isliye khud ko ye dilasa dena band karen ki aapke saath rishte ko lekar wo kanphyus he
 Remember either she loves you or she doesn't love you
 is do jawaab ke bich kanfusion kii koi jagah nahin he

 wo bas apni kahati he, aapaki sunati nahinkabhi shant man se ye sochiega ki aakhri baar aapaki garlfriend ne kab aapke saath baithkar aapaki pareshaani discus kii thi? kahin aisa to nahin ki jab aapako emoshanalee uski sabase zyada jarurat thi wo aapke aas paas thi hi nahin
 If this has happened many times in a row, then the time is to be careful
 rishte main bharose kaa koi vikalp nahin he
 But if the distance between two people starts increasing or there is a confusion, then before proceeding, it is better that you evaluate your relationship on these five parameters
 ham jab pard-likh kar aisa soch rahe hote hai ki ham sab-kuch jaan gaye hai
