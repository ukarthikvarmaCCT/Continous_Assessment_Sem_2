 Despite being big leaders, they are being left behind in a way, the leaders who have come forward at this time are the revered Sri Subhash Chandra Bose of Bengal and the honorable Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 
 
 ""
 
 
 These two leaders are seen emerging in India and taking part in youth movements in particular
 donon hi hindustan kii aazaadee ke kattar samarthak hai, donon hi samajhadaar or sachche deshbhakt hai lekin phir bhi inke vichaaron main jameen-aasmaan kaa antar he
 One is said to be a worshiper of the ancient culture of India, the other is a disciple of the firm West, one is called a Babu with a soft heart and the other is a firm eugenist
 ham is lekh main unke alag-alag vichaaron ko janata ke samaksh rakhenge taaki janata swayan unke antar ko samaj sake or swayan bhi vichaar kar saken
 
 
 ""
 
 
 pichley do-teen maheenon se aap bahut si conferencon ke adhyaksh banaae gaye or apane-apane vichaaron ko logon ke saamne rakh paae
 Subhash Babu is considered a member of the government coup gang and that is why he was imprisoned under the Bengal Ordinance
 aap reeha hue or garam dal ke netaa banaae gaye, aap bharat ko adarsh purna swarajya maanate hai or maharashtra conference main adhyakshiya bhaashan main aapane isi prabhaav kaa prachaar bhi kiya
 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru is the son of Swaraj Party leader Pandit Motilal Nehru
 aap bahut vidwaan hai, aap rus aadi kaa daura kar aae hai
 You are also a leader of the Garam Dal and the proposal of complete self-government was passed at the Madras Conference only by the efforts of you and your colleagues
 aapane amritsar conference ke bhaashan main bhi isi baat par jor diya tha
 
 
 "bhagat Singh further writes in his article, comparing the speeches of the two leaders
 
 
 "
 
 
 Heard a speech by both of you in Mumbai
 jawaharlal nehru isaki adhyakshata kar rahe the or pehle subhash chandra bose ne bhaashan diya
 She is a very emotional Bengali, beginning her speech by saying that India has a special message to the world
 yahaan subhash babu ne apane bhaashan main ek baar phir vedon kii ore loto chalane kii baat kii iske baad bhi ek or bhaashan main unhone rashtravadita ke sambandh main kaha tha
 It is a shadowy and blatant sentiment, plus he has great faith in his archaic era
 He sees the greatness of his archaic age in everything
 
 ""
 
 
 lekin jawaharlal nehru ke vichaar isse bilkul alag he
 He said in one of his addresses that every youth should revolt, not only in the political arena but also in the social, economic and religious fields
 mujhe aise vyakti kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he jo aakar kahe ki falaan baat quran main likhi hui he, koi baat jo apni samajhadaari kii parakh main sahi sabit naa ho use chaahe veda kahen yaa phir puraana nahin manani chahie
 This is the idea of an escort and Subhash's views are that of a royal transformer
 ek ke vichaar main hamen puraani chijen bahut acchhee hai or duusare ke vichaar main unke viruddh vidroh kar dena sahi he
 One is said to be sentimental and one is epochal and rebellious
 
 "referring to the speeches and views of the two leaders, Bhagat Singh has finally delivered a message to the youth which is as follows
 
 
 "
 
 
 Subhash is probably not giving any other mental food except giving some food to the heart
 ab aavashyaktaa is baat kii he ki punjab ke naujavaanon ko in ugantkaari vichaaron ko khub soch vichaar kar pakkaa kar lenaa chahie
 Punjab is in dire need of mental food at this time and it can be got from Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru only
 iskaa arth yah nahin he ki unke andhe pairokaar ban jaaen
 But as far as the ideas are concerned, Punjabi youth should be engaged with them at this time so that they can know about the true meaning of Inquilab, need of Inquilab in Hindustan and what is the place of Inquilab in the world etc
 soch vichaar ke saath noujvaan apane vichaaron ko sthir karen taaki niraashaa maayusi or paraajay ke samay main bhi bhatkaav ke shikaar na hon or akele khadey hokar duniya se mukaable main rah saken
 In this way the public will be able to fulfill the goal of Inquilab

 ibiel siio gini rometi The controversy-ridden n Srinivasan is scheduled to be elected unopposed as the chairman of the BCCI in the general body meeting in Chennai on Sunday, although he will not be able to take charge as chairman due to the directions of the Supreme Court
 tamilnadu ke kaddavar khel prashaasak shrinivasana teesri baar bisisiai kaa adhyaksh banane kii daud main hai
 He will be able to hold the post of chairman only when the Supreme Court gives its final verdict on the petition filed by Bihar Cricket Association Secretary Aditya Verma
 aisi sambhaavna he ki shrinivasana phir jagmohan daalamia ko board kaa kaaryvahak adhyaksh banaaen, lekin unhen atirikt adhikaar die jane kii ummid nahin he
 In such a situation, Sanjay Patel, who is going to become the secretary, will have to sign all the necessary documents until the Supreme Court allows Srinivasan to take over the post
 nyaayadhishon ne is baat par aashcharya vyakt kiya ki ipel spot phixing ke silsile main damaad gurunath mayppan ke khilaaf aarope patr daakhil hone ke baavjood shrinivasana bisisiai ke pad par date hue hai
 The judges made it clear that he would not take up the post of chairman of the board until the matter was resolved
 iske saath hi nyaayadhishon ne sawaal kiya, ‘yadi damaad par aarope patr daakhil kiya gaya he to phir vah prabharee (bisisiai ke adhyaksh) kyon bane hue hai? aap (shrinivasana) nirvaachit hone ke liye itane utsuk kyon hai?’ a proposer and an approver are required to file the nomination for the post of the Speaker, which should be in the zone of the Speaker who is present
 goa cricket sangh or andhra cricket sangh pehle shrinivasana kaa saath nahin dena chaahate the, lekin tamilnadu ke is kaddavar khel prashaasak or unke vishwaasapatro ne unhen manaa liya
 Six of the South Union (tamil Nadu CA, Andhra CA, Karnataka State CA, Kerala CA, Hyderabad CA and Goa CA) are with them, thereby dulling the chances of another candidate standing against them
 iske alaava bisisiai main shaamil raajnneetik diggajon ke chuppi saadh lene se bhi unki raah aasaan ho gai he
 The comments adhikansh rajya sangh jinhen vaarshik anudaan or antarrashtriya match milte hai, shrinivasana ke saath hai
 Apart from this, his strategy of keeping the members happy has also been in his favor
 mahabalipuram ke ek lakjri resort main sadasyon ke liye do din kaa pravaas or kal raat shahar ke paanch sitara hotel main di gai bhavy party iske saboot he
 There are some more important decisions to be taken in tomorrow's AGM, including the decision on the next chairman of the IPL

 Tamil Nadu sports administrator Srinivasan is in the race to become the BCCI President for the third time
 vah adhyaksh pad tabhi sambhaal sakenge jab bihar cricket sangh ke sachiv aditya verma dwaara daayar yachika par ucchtam nyaayalay antim faisla suna degaa
 There is a possibility that Srinivasan will again make Jagmohan Dalmiya the acting chairman of the board, but he is not expected to be given additional powers
 aise main sachiv banane ja rahe sanjay patel ko sabhi jaruri dastavejon par hastakshar karne honge jab tak ucchtam nyaayalay shrinivasana ko pad sanbhaalane kii anumati nahin de detaa
 The judges expressed surprise that despite the filing of a charge sheet against son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan in connection with IPL spot-fixing, Srinivasan is holding the post of BCCI
 nyaayadhishon ne spasht kiya ki is maamle kaa nibatara hone tak vah board ke adhyaksh pad kaa kaarybhaar nahin grahan karenge
 Along with this, the judges questioned, 'if the charge sheet has been filed on the son-in-law, then why does he remain in charge (president of BCCI)? Why are you (srinivasan) so eager to get elected? ' adhyaksh pad kaa namakan daakhil karne ke liye ek prastaavak or ek anumodak kii jarurat hoti he jo nivruthman adhyaksh ke hi jone kaa hona chahie
 The Goa Cricket Association and Andhra Cricket Association did not want to support Srinivasan earlier, but the Tamil Nadu sports administrator and his confidantes convinced him
 dakshin ke chah sangh (tamilnadu sie, andhra sie, karnataka rajya sie, kerala sie, hyderabad sie or goa sie) unke saath he jisase kisi duusare pratyaashee ke unke khilaaf khadey hone kii sambhaavnaayen dhoomil ho gai hai
 Apart from this, the path taken by the political veterans involved in BCCI has also become easier
 tippaniyan Most state associations that receive annual grants and international matches are with Srinivasan
 iske alaava sadasyon ko khush rakhane kii unki ranneeti bhi unke paksh main rahi he
 a two-day stay for members at a luxury resort in Mahabalipuram and a grand party held at the city's five-star hotel last night are proof of this
 kal kii agm main kuch or ahm faisle liye jane hai jinamein ipel ke agle adhyaksh par nirnay shaamil he
 There is speculation about the name of Dalmiya and Anirudh Chaudhary of Haryana
 aisi sambhaavna he ki shrinivasana phir jagmohan daalamia ko board kaa kaaryvahak adhyaksh banaaen, lekin unhen atirikt adhikaar die jane kii ummid nahin he
 In such a situation, Sanjay Patel, who is going to become the secretary, will have to sign all the necessary documents until the Supreme Court allows Srinivasan to take over the post

 sapa adhyaksh or purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne rajyasabha seat par unka patta katkar jaya bachchan ko chauthi baar ucch sadan bhejne kaa faisla kiya to agarwal kaa sapa se bhi mohabhang ho gaya
 Now he has taken the saffron saffron after taking off the sheet of socialism
 ramgopal ke dahinaa haath the naresh agarwalanaresh agarwal sapa ke chanakya kahe jane vaale ramgopal yadav ke sabase kareebi netaa maane jate the
 Due to this, he went from Rajya Sabha member to General Secretary in the party
 ve rashtriya raajnneeti main sapa kaa sabase mukhar cheharaa the
 Now he has decided to give a big blow to Akhilesh by joining hands with sp's biggest political enemy BJP
 'agarwal sapa par boj the'naresh agarwal ke sapa chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hone par party ke pravaktaa sunil saajan ne kaha ki naresh agarwal ke jane se party ko koi nuksaan nahin he, balki wo party ke liye boj the
 It was better that the SP left
 sunil saajan ne kaha ki naresh agarwal unheen saamanti vichaardhaara vaale logon main se ek hai jo akhilesh yadav ke dalit or obisi kii raajnneetik line ko bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe
 While the party president has clearly stated that the party will run on obcs and Dalits, who are to remain and who are to be known, will not be stopped
 'agarwal se sapa ko na nuksaan or na bijepi ko phayda'varisht patrkaar rahis singh ne kaha ki naresh agarwal ke raajnneetik kariyar ko dekhen to wo 1997 se lekar ajtak kai partiyon main rahe
 This did not benefit those political parties but Naresh Aggarwal definitely got political benefits
 wo hameshaa satta ke saath rahanaa chaahate hai
 For the first time in two decades, he remained with the ruling party for one year
 unhone kaha ki agarwal janaadhar vaale netaa nahin hai, hardoi shahar tak hi unka dayera he
 In such a situation, there will be no loss to the SP, nor will the BJP have any advantage in his coming
 haalanki bijepi ne unhen party main lekar un logon ko jarur jhatka diya he jo hardoi main saalon se agarwal ke khilaaf ladate rahe hai
 Rahis Singh said that the damage done to the SP has been done
 ab isse zyada nuksaan tabhi hoga jab usase muslim matadaata khiskegaa, jo philhal dikhataa najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Trouble of BSP candidate in Rajya Sabha elections, Naresh Aggarwal has left SP at a time when BSP and SP are coming together
 unke party chhodane se bijepi ko pehla phayda rajyasabha chunaav main mil saktaa he
 The BJP may get one vote for the 9th candidate, Nitin Aggarwal, son of Aggarwal
 jo hardoi se sapa ke vidhayak hai
 The 23-year-old rivalry between the SP-BSP has turned into a friendship for the Rajya Sabha seat itself
 rajyasabha kaa chunaav is dosti kaa test mana ja rahaa he
 On the basis of this result, the building of the SP-BSP alliance will stand in 2019
 aise main rajyasabha seat basapa ke liye jitani ahm he utani hi sapa ke liye bhi he
 The political journey of Agarwal is significant that 68-year-old Naresh Agarwal is originally from Hardoi
 agarwal biessi, elelbi hai or takreeban chaar dashak se raajnneeti main sakriy hai
 He was elected Congress MLA for the first time in 1980
 iske baad 1989 se 2008 tak lagaataar upi vidhansabha ke sadsy rahe
 Agarwal formed the democratic Congress by breaking the Congress and in 1997 formed the Democratic Congress Party by breaking the Congress Party
 1997 se 2001 tak wo upi sarkaar main urja mantri rahe
 He was the Minister of Tourism from 2003 to 2004
 2004 se 2007 tak unhone upi ke parivahan mantri kaa kaarybhaar sambhala
 He was later elected to the Rajya Sabha and held important positions in several committees of Parliament
 unke parivaar main patni, ek betaa or ek beti he
 His son Nitin Agarwal has been a minister in the Akhilesh government and is currently a SP MLA from Hardoi
 sapa kii tarah bijepi aazaadee nahinaresh agarwal aksar apane bayanon ke liye media main surkhiyaan batorte rahete hai
 At times, he has also regretted his controversial statements
 samaajawaadee party main jab akhilesh banaam mulaayam kii jang chhidi hui thi tab naresh agarwal ne khulkar akhilesh yadav kaa saath diya tha
 Naresh Aggarwal is also known for his penetration in every party
 unki isi paith kaa nateeja he ki sapa se naaraaz hone par unhen turant hi bijepi se party main shaamil hone kaa mauka mil gaya he
 But like the SP in the BJP, they will not be able to play freely

 Union Home Minister and BJP President Amit Shah said at an event held at the Constitution Club in Delhi on Sunday that appeasement politics is behind the triple talaq protest
 shah ne kaha ki teen talaak kisi main hataane kii himmat nahin thi
 PM Modi's name will be written in the social reformers of history to take this historic step
 amit shah ne kaha ki teen talaak ek kupratha thi, isamen koi andeh nahin he
 He said, it took 56 years for us to end this evil practice, the reason for this is the politics of appeasement of the Congress
 teen talaak par kanoon banane se muslim mahilaon ko haq mila he
 Amit Shah said, it is said that triple talaq is a part of Muslim Shariah, not to interfere in the customs of our religion
 jabaki bangladesh, afghanistan, morocco, indonesia, srilanka, jordan samet 19 desh aise hai jinhone 1922-1963 tak teen talaak khatm kar diya
 If it was against Islam then why would these countries do non-islamic work
 modi sarkaar ne liye 25 aitihaasik nirnyaunhone kaha ki narendra modi sarkaar ne saadhe paanch saal ke apane kaarykaal ke andar 25 se zyada aitihaasik nirnay lekar desh kii disha badalane kaa kaam kiya he
 This is the wonder of Narendra Modi's leadership
 tripal talaak ko khatm karnaa keval or keval muslim samaaj ke phaayde ke liye he
 The persecution of triple talaq suffers from 50% of the Muslim population, ie mothers and sisters
 shah ne kaha, ' aaj agar yah bill ham lekar nahin aate to yah duniya ke saamne bharat ke loktantr ke liye ek bada dhabba hota
 Muslim women fought a lot for this
 shahbaano ko tripal talaak diya gaya to ve apni ladaai supreme court tak gayi
 The Home Minister said, "the politics which Congress started after the 60s and the other parties also followed it has had an impact on the country's democracy, social life and the upliftment of the poor
" jo abhaav main ji rahaa he, jo garib-pichhadaa he, wo kisi bhi dharm kaa ho
 Take up what has been left behind in the development phase, the society will automatically move forward on the all-inclusive and all-inclusive path
 'unhone kaha ki bina tushtikaran yah sarkaar samavikas, sarvasparshi vikaas, sarvasamaveshi vikaas ke aadhaar par paanch saal chali
 By imposing the same theory in 2019, the people of this country have given a majority again to free the country from appeasement
 Union Home Minister Amit Shah: Even today, Congress has no shame, they say they are in favour of triple talaq & it should stay
 Why? They have no answer
 They didn't give a single justification for their stand & argued just to register protest so their vote bank stays intact

 2014 main is desh kii janata ne narendra modi ke netritv main bhaajapa ko purna bahumat dekar tushtikaran kii raajnneeti ke ant kii shuruyaat kar di
 Divorce on small talk Amit Shah said, 'the situation was that people used to give three divorces even by calling women fat
 is kaanoon se hindu, sikh or isai ko nahin sirf muslimon ko hi laabh hone vaala
 We even asked the protesting mps to debate in front of the media
 'kanoon main upyukt raahatunhone kaha ki kaanoon ke mutabiq aaropee ko tab tak zamaanat nahin milegi, jab tak court mahila kaa paksh sun nahin leti
 An NGO survey said that 92 percent of Muslim women want to get rid of triple talaq
 log kehete hai ki kanoon bana dene se kya teen talaaq ruk jayega? main kahata hum kya chori rokane kaa kaanoon bana dene se hi chori band ho jaati he? yah kaanoon shikshanatmak banaaya gaya he, taaki logon main bhay paidaa ho

 2014 main is desh kii janata ne narendra modi ke netritv main bhaajapa ko purna bahumat dekar tushtikaran kii raajnneeti ke ant kii shuruyaat kar di
 Those who have neither hard work nor compassion, they adopt shortcuts like appeasement and do votebank politics
 gauratlab he modi sarkaar ne sansad main teen talaak ko khatm karne vaala bill paarit karaayaa he
 After the triple talaq bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha, PM Modi said that his move will be remembered in the history of India
 pradhanmantri ne kaha tha, 'yah puure desh ke liye ek aitihaasik din he
 Today, crores of Muslim mothers and sisters have won and they have got the right to live with respect
 sadiyon se teen talaak kii kupratha se peedit muslim mahilaon ko aaj nyaay mila he
 On this historic occasion, i thank all mps
 ' The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has canceled Team India's tour of Zimbabwe
 board ne daura radd karne kii sabase badi vajah khilaadiyon kaa thakaa hona bataaya he
 However, it is not hidden from anyone that there is a dispute between BCCI and the company that broadcasts the series, Ten Sports
 10 july se team india kaa zimbabwe daura shuru hona tha, jinamein 3 vanade or do tii-20 match khele jane the
 The most relief from the series cancellation will be given to the players of Team India, who have been playing non-stop cricket for the last one year
 sawaal he ki agar board ko thakaan kii vajah se series radd karnaa tha, to phir zimbabwe cricket board ko daure kaa elaan karne se kyon nahin roka gaya? kuch din pehle zimbabwe cricket board ne press release jari kar series par muhar lagaai thi

 series radd hone se sabase zyada raahat team india ke khilaadiyon ko milegi, jo pichley ek saal se non-stop cricket khel rahe hai
 The question is if the board was to cancel the series due to fatigue, then why was the Zimbabwe Cricket Board not prevented from announcing the tour? a few days ago the Zimbabwe Cricket Board issued the press release and stamped the series
 tippaniyan On the other hand, there was speculation of cancellation of the india-zimbabwe tour due to the timely settlement of the dispute between BCCI and Ten Sports
 ten sports, zee media group kaa hissaa he or isiel naam se T20 cricket lig chalaati rahi he, jo bisisiai kii indian premier lig se takaraati rahi he
 In recent times, Zee is trying to re-start the T20 league, which has gone crazy to the BCCI

 Host Russia has so far made a surprise appearance in the 21st edition of the FIFA World Cup, making it to the final-16 for the first time, but things are not going to be easy for them the way they were in the group round
 
 rus ko ab apni abhi tak kii sabase badi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa he
 The hosts will clash with Spain in the pre-quarter-finals at the Luzhnaki Stadium, considered the 2010 winner and the title's most potent contender
 rus ne pehle match main saudi arab ko 5-0 se maat di thi
 After that Egypt was also defeated
 use haalanki apane aakhri group match main urugve ke khilaaf haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 She must have learned a lesson from this defeat and would like to get down in front of Spain by correcting her mistakes
 haar se ho saktaa he rus ke manobal par thodaa asar padaa ho kyonki urugve badi team he or uske saamne bikhar janaa team kii asal sthiti ko bayaan karata he
 But to overcome that defeat, he has the confidence to make it to the pre-quarter-finals for the first time and it can also prove dangerous for Spain
 is world cap main abhi tak rus kii takat akraman pankti rahi he jisane danaadan gol barasaaen hai
 It will be interesting to see how effective this offensive line will be in front of Spain
 rus kaa atake uske star striker denis cherishev par nirbhar he jo is world cap main abhi tak teen gol kar chuke hai jabaki ek main unhone acist kiya he
 In front of Russia, there are defenders like Karvahal, Pike who will not be easy to distinguish
 vahiin rus ke dephence ko bhi chaukanna rahane kii jarurat he
 Uruguay's attack proved him weak and Spain's attack is better than Uruguay's
 rus kaa atake main diego costa, silva, lucas jaise naam shaamil hai
 At the same time, midfielders Andre Iniesta and Silva can also cause trouble for Russia
 rus ke liye yah match kisi chunauti se kam nahin he kyonki is match main uske dephence or atake donon kii kadi parikshaw he
 a mistake here could end his World Cup campaign
 spain bhi rus ke halke main nahin le saktaa
 Russia have confidence in winning matches in the past, and in such a game like football, any team can prove dangerous

 bisisiai adhyaksh en shrinivasana ko shuukravaar ko tab karaara jhatka laga jab board ke do senior padaadhikariyon sachiv sanjay jagadale or koshadhyaksh ajay shirke ne istipha dekar un par apana pad chhodane ke liye dabaav badha diya
 Former cricketer board secretary Jagdale and treasurer Shirke sent a resignation letter to Srinivasan saying that he was deeply hurt by the recent developments in cricket
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki jagadale chennai superkings ke team principal mayppan or siesake frenchiji kii maalik india cement, jise shrinivasana chalaate hai, ke khilaaf aaropon kii jaanch ke liye gathit teen sadasyeey ayog ke sadsy bhi hai lekin unhone jaanch samiti se baahar rahane kaa faisla kiya he
 Jagdale said, 'I have expressed my inability to participate in the investigation
 ’shuukravaar kaa din naatakeey ghatnakram ke naam rahaa
 Jagdale, Shirke and Joint Secretary Anurag Thakur spoke to Srinivasan and asked him to decide to convene an executive meeting by evening and threatened to resign if he did not
 shrinivasana ne haalanki 8 june ko baithak bula di lekin do padaadhikariyon ne apana pad chhodane kaa faisla kiya jise board pramukh ko baahar karne ke liye dabaav kii ranneeti mana ja rahaa he

 It will not be easy for BCCI boss n Srinivasan to continue in the post of what Gurunath Meiyappan has revealed in his interrogation with Mumbai Police
 mumbai police ke mutabik isisi kii anti karpshan unit ne phixing ko lekar chetavanee jari kii thi jiske baad mayppan ne vindu daara singh ko alert kar diya tha
 Meiyappan had learned long ago that the icc's Anti Corruption Unit had got the idea of fixing and betting in the IPL
 mumbai krime branch ke mutabik gurunath mayppan ne vindu daara singh ko bataaya ki srisanth kii giraftaar ke baad anti karpshan unit ne use chetavanee di he or isliye wo saavdhaan ho jaae
 According to the Mumbai Police, Gurunath Meiyappan had put Vindoo on the surveillance of both of them as soon as Vindu was alerted on the phone
 bataaya ye bhi ja rahaa he ki isisi kii anti karpshan unit ne ise lekar bisisiai ko bhi chetavanee jari kii thi
 So did the Anti Corruption Unit of the ICC first alert the BCCI? Did the information reach Meiyappan through BCCI after which Meiyappan alerted Vindu? This new disclosure could make the BCCI chief Srinivasan sleepy because if the icc's Anti Corruption Unit had cautioned before fixing, then what is the BCCI going on? Was
 udhar bisisiai ke sanyukt sachiv anuraag thakur kii maane to isisi anti karpshan unit kii ore se jari chetavanee ke bare main unhen bhi koi jaankaree nahin
 Anurag Thakur says that if something like this has happened, it will be discussed in the board meeting

 Srinivasan said that he had no knowledge of any such ICC alert
 isisi ne kaha tha ki ipel main phikisang kaa pehle hi shaq tha, or is baat kii jaankaree bisisiai bhi di gai thi

 According to sources, 18 associations are against Srinivasan

 Meanwhile, BCCI joint secretary Anurag Thakur has also denied having any information in the matter
 isisi ne april main hi bisisiai ko ipel-6 main phixing or sattebaaji ko lekar ashanka jaahir kar di thi
 According to sources, after Sreesanth's arrest, Gurunath cautioned Vindu that the ICC had an eye and needed to be cautious

 ek had tak to yah dashakon ke galat mulya nirdhaaran or sabsidi ke rup main galat sarkari hastkshep ke kaaran hua jiskaa parinaam he ki pani kii killat vaala desh, chaaval kaa niryaat kar rahaa tha, jisaki fasal ko sabase zyada pani chahie
 Secondly, to some extent it was a result of neglect, successive governments in successive efforts to eliminate multiple middle-income middlemen in order to reach agricultural yields from farm to consumer; However, instead of improving the farmers' access to new technologies, seeds or land, governments have lost resources to debt waiver, wrongful cash transfers, etc
 pradhanmantri modi sirf apane gujarat ke record se hi nahin chune gaye ki ve viraasat kii aisi samasyaon ko khatm kar denge, balki aavashyak sudhaaron ke apane vaade ke liye bhi chune gaye, jo aarthik vruddhi or rojgaar badhayega
 Reforms needed for economic growth The reforms had long been in dire need
 vikaas ko gati dene vaale udaarikaran ke daur ke sudhaar 1990 ke dashak or 2000 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main alag-alag rajnatik jhukaavon vaali sarkaron ne kiye, in sudhaaron ke jariye arthvyavastha kii kuch beditan todi gayi
 For example, the problems of getting a license to start a business, keeping some areas safe only for small businesses or the government, and the provision of higher fees to keep Indian business non-competitive
 pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar hi antim sarkaar thi jisane lagaataar sudhaar par dhyaan kendrit rakhaa lekin vah kaarobaari maahaul, shram, bhoomi or saarvajanik kshetra kii bhoomika jaise sabase kathin sudhaaron kii ore bad paati, chunaav haar gai
 The UPA government of 2004–2009 did not have an internal consensus to pass reforms that accelerated development, while the government that came to power again in 2009–2014 was crippled by scandals and non-cooperation of the opposition
 partiyon ke bich sarvasammati keval rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee yojana (naregaa) or rashtriya khaadya suraksha adhinium jaise punarvitaran par jor dene vaale sudhaaron ke liye hi bani
 Growth slowed after the global financial crisis and the government's focus on redistribution pressured the fiscal situation
 2012 main vitt mantri pi
 Under Chidambaram's leadership, the UPA began to focus on restoring macroeconomic stability
 modi sarkaar ne shuru main is prakriya ko jari rakhaa, jiskaa uddeshy vittiya kharchon ko niyantran main rakhana or pichley kai bajaton main hui windo-dressing (upree sajaavat) ko band karnaa tha
 It approved rbi's initiative to curb inflation
 sarkari bainkon main teji se badhate duubat karj ne bainkon kii karj dene kii takat ko kamjor kar diya or sarkaar ne arabiai ke chalaae safai abhiyaan ko insolvency and bankerpsi code (ibisi) ko paarit karke samarthan diya
 The Real Estate (regulation) Act i
e
rera, created to unify the Indian market and clean up the mess of the real estate sector along with GST, was also aimed at improving the institutional structure of the country
 There were better efforts
 magar, jaisaa upie sarkaar ke paryaavaran niyaman main sudhaar ke saath hua, modi sarkaar ne bhi paaya ki maujuuda prachlan ko badalane kii koshish vaale sudhaaron ke parinaam apekshit nahin rahe hai
 They disrupt the pace of development work
 masalan, jab pramotaron ko lagane laga ki diwalia hone ke kaaran unhen apni fermon se haath dhonaa pad saktaa he to unhone (sahi hi) bank rinon ko jokhim puunji maananaa band kar diya
 The bankers also turned risky as they saw that now they would have to accept the loss and they could not put it forward the head of the heir
 iskaa sidhaa matlab tha ki ab jokhim puunji ke nae sroton ko dhundne kii jarurat thi, sudhaaron se pallaa jhaadkar nahin, jaisaa prabhavit paksh suza rahe the, balki or adhik sudhaaron ke saath aage badaae kii jarurat thi
 For example, steps were taken to improve corporate governance and to attract foreign investors or to allow them to take more risks by increasing the valuation capabilities of Indian insurance companies and pension funds
 iskaa yah bhi matlab tha ki sarkaar ko bhoomi adhigrahan aasaan banaakar or aavashyak manjuuri dekar pariyojnaon ko jokhim se baahar laana tha
 In other words, reforms that accelerated development were needed
 sarkaar ko apane kadamon ke anpekshit parinaamon ko sweekaar karnaa tha or sudhaar kaary ko aage badhanaa tha
 The record of the Modi government in this case is mixed
 masalan, sarkaar ne jiesti kanoon ko sansad main paas karaane main to paryaapt rajnatik kaushal dikhaaya, lekin amal ke maamle main kaaphi chook kii gai
 The government undoubtedly felt the need to improve it
 lekin, jiesti prakriyaaon or daron main baar-baar badlaavon se bhram or anischitata kii sthiti hi badhati gai or uske anupaalan main dikktein ain
 For example, the possibility of a reduction in GST rates on vehicles may have led to a decline in auto sales in recent times
 iske alaava, follow-ap bhi galat disha main rahe- inspectoron ko vaahanon ko rokane or unki talaashi kii shaktiyaan di gayi, jisase inspectoron kii manamaani ko shah mili
 Tax collection from GST is much lower than anticipated, and the benefit of economic growth is much lower than it should have been
 centre ne rajyon se is kanoon ke prati rajamandi hasil karne keliye nunatam rajasav guarantee kii peshkash kii or isse rajkosh par or dabaav badha
 At least government efforts are on to improve the GST system, however, the need is to have a clear medium-term plan based on experience, instead of continuing short-term reforms to clearly state what will be decided and what will be decided because of continuous revisions
 Uncertainty increases
 sarkari bainkon ke kaamkaaj main sudhaar ke liye bank board beuro jaisi sanstha banane kii koshishon ko naukarshahi ke makadzaal or rajnatik ichhashakti kii kami ke kaaran dhakka pahunchaa he
 There is very little independence in the board of public sector banks, and the finance ministry's decision to merge the banks will consume all the energy of management while eliminating the burden of bad debts and sensible renewal of this energy
 Need to be installed
 mudra rin or rin melon par jor dekar bhavishya ke liye or adhik samasyaayein paidaa kii ja rahi hai, yahaan tak ki bainkon ko in rinon par badhate gaiyr-bhugtan ko nazarandaaj karne ke liye niamak chhot di gai he
 As far as incomplete reforms related to business environment, land acquisition, labor and public sector role are concerned, the Modi government has shown cowardice
 shuruyaat main, sarkaar ne in sudhaaron par drudh dikhaai di
 But as soon as the opposition started accusing the government of being a well-wisher of businessmen, the government started sliding these reforms down the priority list
 vishwa bank ke 'kaarobaari sahuuliyat' sanketakon par bharat kii ranking sudhari, dilli or mumbai (jahaan vishwa bank pragati ko maapta he) main kuch prakriyaaon ko saral banaaya gaya lekin baaki jagahon par kaarobaariyon kii raay se nahin lagata hai ki buniyadi pareshaaniyaan ghati hai
 The benefits of the reforms of the Vajpayee era are now almost gone and the pace of economic growth has slowed down due to not trying to overcome the inherited problems
 upie kii tarah hi modi prashasan ke saadhe paanch saal kii safaltaaen punarvitaran main rahi hai
 Jan Dhan Program facilitated bank accounts for everyone, toilets are being constructed for everyone under Swachh Bharat program, Ujjwala scheme is distributing gas connections to poor women, Ayushman Bharat starts medical service for poor Is doing, while sharing a currency program business with loan fairs, trying to give loans to all who need it 
 sarkaar ne upie sarkaar ke pramukh kaarykram manaregaa par bhi lagaataar kharch badhaayaa he
 Redistribution is a worthy goal and many of these programs have benefitted the poor
 haalanki, majboot rajasav vruddhi ke bina kharch main lagaataar vruddhi se sarkari khajaane main giravat ai he, vishesh rup se isliye kyonki ab sarkari rin ke mulya ko kam karne ke liye mudrasphiti uplabdh nahin he
 Even the Comptroller and Auditor General has once again had to ask the government to eliminate the off-balance sheet fiscal irregularities
 darasal, nijee kshetra par ab dabaav bad rahaa he kyonki kai sarkari sansthaaen apana kharch kam dikhaane ke liye bhugtan ko dabaae rakhti hai
 To understand where the lapse occurred, where the lapse and what went wrong, we must first look at the centralized form of the present government
 na sirf faisle, balki idia or yojanaayen bhi pradhanmantri ke aasapaas ek choti birdari or pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo) se nikalati hai
 This fraternity continues to pursue the political and social agenda of the party
 ye agenda purv nirdhaarit hai or yah birdari usamen paarangat he
 Its focus is less on economic reforms, it is not even clear of the agenda at the top and there is also little understanding of how the economy works at the national level rather than at the state
 iske alaava, rajnatik or saamaajik agenda ke praathamikta hasil karne kii ek vajah shaayad yah bhi he ki satta kaa centre iske saath adhik sahaj anubhav karata he or iske paas donon ko saadhane ke liye rajnatik kaushal or dimagi rujhaan paryaapt nahin he
 In particular, the implementation of political and social agendas requires the mobilization of political power, which is achieved through populist economic measures
 haalanki vikaas, aksar ghoshit uddeshy to rahata he lekin jaise hi yah ehsaas hota he ki iske liye uthaae kadamon kii rajnatik keemat zyada uthaani pad sakati he, uskaa mahatv duusare sthaan par chalaa jaataa he
 Excessive centralization can work, provided it has a coherent economic outlook at the center
 pichhali sarkarein asangat gathjod kii bhale rahi hon lekin ve lagaataar aarthik udaarikaran kii raah par badhati raheen or jahaan kamjor paksh dekha, sarkaar ke kadam peeche khinche or pratispardhaa ko badhaayaa
 The Modi government came to power with the slogan 'minimum Government, Maximum Governance'
 is naare ko aksar galat samajha jaataa he
 This meant that the government would do things more efficiently, not the people and the private sector would be freed to do more
 sarkaar ne automation kii ore to vaazib kadam badaye- labhaarthiyon tak laabh kaa pratyaksh hastantaran mahatvapurn uplabdhi he- lekin kai kshetron main sarkaar kii bhoomika kaa vistaar hua he, gata nahin he
 Such over-centralization, the absence of powerful ministers and the lack of a coherent guiding perspective determine that reform efforts move only when the PMO focuses on them and as soon as its focus turns to other issues Focus shifts
 aksar, aise prayaas badi nitiyon kii tarah aate hai kyonki samasyaayein badi hoti hai or un par mahatvapurn kadam uthaane kii jarurat hoti he- isliye hamen notebandi, bainkon ke vilay, korporate tex main katautee jaise bade halle vaale kadam dekhne ko milte hai
 However, it is not necessary that such drastic transformative steps have been taken at the right time or with a big perspective, hence their economic benefit also reduced
 iske alaava, anpekshit parinaamon se nipatane ke liye folsop karrwai bhi aparyaapt he kyonki sambandhit mantralayon ko shaktiheen bana diya gaya he
 Take the Make in India initiative, for example, which aims to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and global supply chains in India
 tarriff or karon main lagaataar or nirarthak badlaav, saath hi saath gharelu companiyon ke hiton ko saadhane ke liye niyamon main badlaav ne isaki gambhirtha ko samaapt kar diya
 One such case is the RCEP Trade Agreement, in which India's refusal to join, a sudden decision was taken
 bharat shaamil nahin hota he (haalanki yah abhi bhi ho saktaa he), to isse bharat ke ek kam aakarshak nivesh gantavy banane kaa jokhim he
 Foreign investors are not queuing up to invest in India — FDI is not much higher today in terms of dollars than it was in 2007–2008, even though the economy has grown very large [see graphic: FDI]
 durbhaagya se, gharelu vyavsaayon se to nivesh aa nahin rahaa, or nivesh main yah tehraav is baat kaa sabase majboot sanket he ki kuch badi baari chook to hui he
 What can be done? Start by recognizing the magnitude of the problem, do not tell every inner or outer critic to be politically motivated
 yah maananaa band kar den ki samasya asthaayee he or asahaj karne vaali khabaron or asuvidhajanak surveykshanon ko dabaane se samasya dur ho jaaegi
 Besides, even if some problems are inherited, this government too has been in power for five and a half years and should have been solved by now
 prashasan ke taur-tareekon main badlaav ke saath bade paimaane par nae sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa he
 Decentralization is important for economic development
 centre ko sudhaaron ko disha or rajnatik protsaahan dena he, vah har lagaam thame nahin rah saktaa
 It has to start by giving strength to its ministers, and the states will also have to take it along because many tasks can be done only with the support of the state
 rajyon kaa bharosa phir hasil karne ke liye, centre pandrahawein vitt ayog kii sharton main sanshodhan karke shuruyaat kar saktaa he, jo pichley aayogon ke rajasav hastantaran kii prakriya ko ulatney par jor detaa lagata he
 a coherent agenda would include: extinguish the fires: Construction, real estate and infrastructure sectors are in deep trouble and the condition of non-banking financial companies (nbfcs) that provide loans to them is also slim
 isse gramin kshetron ko jhatka lag rahaa he, jahaan atirikt aay ke liye bhoomi kii bikri or nirmaan kaaryon main rojgaar kaa sahaara hota he
 No doubt, some initial tensions have subsided, especially in well-managed nbfcs
 phir bhi bahut-si enbiensi abhi bhi samasyaon se jujh rahi hai
 The longer they remain engulfed in problems, the greater the losses and the higher the probability that the banks that have given loans for construction projects along with nbfcs will come in the wake of the problem
 isamen bharpoor sarkari paisa daalane ke bajaae, pehle is sector ko saaf karnaa hoga or shuruyaat enbiensi se hogi, lekin sankatagrast bade develper bhi isaki jad main hone chahie
 The beginning may be from here that the RBI reviews the quality of assets of large NBFC companies, and gives it a clean chit that has better capitalization
 jisaki puunji kam he, use jald se jald puunji jutaney ko kahe or jo mahangi dar par puunji ke prabandh main asamarth hai unhen sarkaar samarthit fund se puunji dilaai jaae
 The government is sensibly implementing the Insolvency Code in the NBFC
 iske samanaantar, jo develper difolt kar rahe hai, unhen fast-trek divaaliepan main daal diya janaa chahie or sarkaar samarthit fund (agar kahin or se fund uplabdh nahin he) se super-praathamikta vaale rin uplabdh karaae jane chahie taaki ve pariyojnaon ko puraa kar saken
 Some constant pressure should be maintained on real estate developers, particularly those who receive financial assistance to relieve the burden of property
 oune-paune daam par jaaydaad ko bechakar nikalnaa haalanki, kisi ke hit main nahin he
 Similarly, attention should also be paid to infusion of stuck infrastructure projects
 bijli kshetra main vishesh dhyaan dene kii jarurat he, jahaan bijli vitaran companiyon ke sudhaar kaa sarkaar kaa udai kaarykram patari se utar gaya he
 The stagnation of investment in this sector and the crisis of the existing power generating companies will block the development in the country as the generation of electricity cannot be increased immediately if the need arises
 centre or rajyon ko milakar yah tay karnaa chahie ki bijli kii keemat uchit tay kii gai he, uski khapat kii sahi recording ho rahi he or pichley anubandhon kaa paalan kiya jaataa he taaki utpaadakon ke man main yah bharosa bane ki unke nuksaan kii bharpai kii jaaegi
 The state of the country in which its best system is in force should be shared with every state
 rajya ke swaamitv vaali vitaran companiyon, vishesh rup se graahakon se judi ikaayiyon, ke bheetar or adhik pratispardhaa ko badhaava dena chahie
 For example, by dividing some of their work into pieces and handing over some work in private hands if possible
 anya bahari rajya vitaran companiyon ke jariye bhi pratispardhaa ko protsaahit kiya ja saktaa he-jisamen utpaadakon ko rashtriya grid par ucchtam boli lagane vaale ko bechney kii anumati dena bhi shaamil he
 As before, the Center could offer bonuses for reforms, but not the way it is in the rise, should only do so when certain results are revealed
 ant main, doorsanchaar kshetra vishesh ullekh ke yogya he kyonki kabhi teji se badhata yah kshetra aaj gahare sankat main he or desh ke adhikansh hisson main ekadhikaar yaa phir do companiyon ke adhikaar kii ore bad rahaa he
 In the short term, the only objective should be to preserve enough rivals in the region — once again, the Center is currently not paying attention to the region's growing problems and this problem is becoming increasingly serious
 dderghaavadhi main, bharat ko apni niamak prakriya kii samiksha kerani chahie or is kshetra main ekasmaan pratispardhaa ko badhaava dena chahie
 Create an environment for investment and development
 The country again needs a proactive reform program that focuses on the liberalization of capital, land and labor markets
 krishi, nirmaan or bijli jaise kshetra, jisase aaj pareshaani ke daur main hai, agar un par uchit dhyaan diya jaae to ve vikaas ke ingine ban sakate hai
 It should be decided in agricultural reforms that seeds, technology, electricity, finance and insurance, etc
, are easily available
 kisaanon ko jameen patte par dene or tractor jaise sansadhano ke liye sahakaari saajhedaari ko protsaahan diya janaa chahie
 Improvements should be made that allow the farmer to access warehouses, rural industries and end consumers, whether through transport or the Internet
 jab ye sudhaar lagu kiye jaaen to mulya nirdhaaran or kharid sahit utpaadan ke har charan main nirantar or sarkaar ke hastkshep kii pratha samaapt kii jaani chahie
 Much of this should be compensated by direct cash transfer to farmers per acre
 bada lakshya kuch kisaanon ko krishi se baahar nikalne main sakasham banane kaa hona chahie, jisase shesh kisaan bade paimaane par paidaavaar kaa laabh adhik se adhik le saken
 Today, land acquisition is extremely difficult, which hinders not only the construction of highways and highways, but also the construction of industrial plants, office parks and affordable housing
 desh ko vishesh rup se sabase garib rajyon main bhoomi ke maanchitran or swaamitv adhikaar sthapit karne kii prakriya main teji laane kii aavashyaktaa he
 This requires establishing a more transparent process of determining and changing the zoning of the land, as well as filing changes in ownership, recognizing that some agricultural land will inevitably have to be used for development
 ant main, jabaran bhoomi adhigrahan apvadswarup hi kiya janaa chahie, centre ko bhoomi adhigrahan par kanoon main sanshodhan ke liye rajyon main amal main laai ja rahi prakriyaaon main se sarvottam ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie taaki vikreta ke hiton kii raksha karte hue ise lagu karnaa aasaan ho jaae
 Economist Arvind Panagariya has often reiterated that India needs to encourage large companies, whose productivity will be able to make India competitive
 yahaan ek or mahatvapurn baat yah he ki shram anubandhon ko adhik lacheela bananaa hoga
 Today, industrial firms are forced to make their employees permanent after one year, or they keep employees on short-term contracts and even periodically remove them so that employees have no claim to be permanent
 isi ekmaatr uplabdh vikalp ke jariye niyokta karmchaariyon ko zyaadaatar theke par yaa phir asthai rakhana pasand karte hai, taaki unhen shramikon ke prashikshan par zyada nivesh na karnaa pade or shramikon ke liye naukari kii suraksha bahut kam hoti he
 The government, after consultations with unions and employers, requires amendments to the law to create an intermediate contract route where workers gain rights over time (such as greater compensation for employment) but The job should not be permanent
 maujuuda sthaayee karmchaariyon ko iske daayre se baahar rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Promote domestic competition: Competition is an incentive for greater domestic efficiency
 desh ko tarriff kam karke or mukt vyapaar samjhauton main shaamil hokar gharelu pratispardhaa ko lagaataar badhaane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Today, the export is mainly to improve the quality of imported goods and send them back out, and if trade barriers are high, then India will not be able to push Make in India much further
 vastav main, 1990 ke dashak main shuru hue sthir vyapaar or nivesh udaarikaran ko ulatna, bharat kii arthvyavastha ko kam vaarshik vruddhi par waapas le janaa hi hoga
 Those who argue that India is non-competitive should look into history to say that the most accurate way to keep someone non-competitive is to create high barriers to competition
 bharat jitani baadhaon ko paar karata jayega, uskaa vyavsaay kshetra khud ko nae sire se dhaalega, nai urja paaegaa
 This is not economic theology, it has been India's own experience
 adhik nivesh aakarshith karne ke liye yah jaruri he ki bharat main karadhaan or niyam-kaayadon main badlaavon kaa anumaan lagaana aasaan ho
 The changes should take place after open discussion, not under pressure from questionable bureaucratic methods and absurd arguments or certain vested interests
 prastaavit badlaavon ko tippanee, bahes ke liye saarvajanik kiya janaa chahie or lagu kiye jane ke baad udyogon ko unhen apnaane ke liye samay bhi diya janaa chahie
 Some regulatory agencies in India already follow this process, others are required to do the same
 laagat, pratispardhaa or utpaadakta par prayek nae mahatvapurn viniman ke prabhaav kaa moolyankan karne vaali ek swatantra nigaraanee aathak agency (pratiyogita ayog kii tarah) kaa gathan bhi uchit kadam ho saktaa he jo jahaan aavashyak ho, vahaan faislon par punarvichaar ko protsaahit kare
 This will increase the confidence of investors that the changes are appropriate and they will reduce the relief to the untrained judiciary for relief
 nunatam sarkaar kaa matlab aisi sarkaar he jo apni lagaam dhili rakhe or chizon ko adhik paardarshee or purvanumaan yogya banaae jahaan isaki vastav main aavashyaktaa he
 The government should, where possible, withdraw from doing business directly
 kai fermon ke nijeekaran kii haal main hui ghoshnaa swaagatyogy he, lekin ise mukhya rup se sansaadhan jutaney vaali kavayad ke rup main nahin dekha janaa chahie
 Nor should government property be sold to enterprising families already dominant in the economy because it poses the risk of economic powers collapsing in some hands
 iske bajaay, nijeekaran karne vaali fermon ke liye ek shashan or protsaahan sanrachana banane par dhyaan kendrit kiya janaa chahie taaki unke karmchaariyon or parisampattiyon kaa upyog rashtriya vikaas ke liye sabase adhik utpaadak rup se kiya ja sake
 This will require thoughtful design
 sarkaar har jagah kadam peeche nahin khinchegi
 To improve governance, the government may have to expand its capabilities, especially in environmental regulation or controlling the quality of education, food and health
 bharat seva kshetra ko nazarandaaj nahin kar saktaa, jo vikaas ke nae ingine ban sakate hai or apane logon ko un naukariyon ke liye sakasham banaakar nae rojgaar ke srijan main sakasham ho sakate hai
 a new path to India's economic development can be opened by making the entry and investment in education, healthcare, tourism and finance sector easier and keeping in mind the consumer experience
 masalan, bharat adhik se adhik medical college or aspataal kholane kii suvidha detaa he to bharat ke doctor or aspataal apane logon ke saath-saath duniyabar ke logon ke bhi adhik se adhik upachaar main sakasham ho sakate hai
 Along with this, the rules of recognition process and quality of service should be made transparent and rigid so that quacks and disqualifications can be kept away from it
 niamakon ko jaankaree ekatra karne or graahak anubhav kaa akalan karne ke liye nai praudyogikiyon ke vikaas ko protsaahit karnaa chahie, or khud inkaa adhik upyog karnaa chahie
 There are reports and books of many commissions which elaborate on each of these issues in great detail and the government does not have to go too far to seek advice
 bahut saare bhartiya visheshgy hai, kuch to khud sarkaar main bhi hai, jo vishisht kshetron main sudhaar prakriya kaa maargdarshan kar sakate hai
 If the government wants to speed up the reform process, for this it will have to rely on experts including its own institutions and make them stronger
 satta main baithe sabhi logon kii ek pravriti hoti he ki ve adhik se adhik niyantran chaahate hai, or yah sarkaar koi apwaad nahin he, khaskar apane tay saamaajik or rajnatik agenda ke maamle main
 Yet an autocratic government is striving to remove the hurdles in its path by empowering its investigative and tax agencies, reorienting the discourse through new narratives, crippling its own officials who Fearful of similar actions by future governments, and the business class is also very cautious about long-term investment
 hamaari jaanch or kar agenciyon ko peshewar rup se vaastavik aparaadhiyon par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie—kya yah chintajanak nahin he ki haal ke varshon main bhi kisi bhi bade bank dhokhadhadikarta ko ab tak salaakhon ke peeche nahin laayaa ja sakaa he? haalanki, peshewar hone kaa arth yah bhi he ki agenciyon ko is baat kii khuli chhot nahin honi chahie ki ve bevajaah dhar-pakad ke abhiyaan chheden, sabhi vyavsaay ko shaq kii najar se hi dekhen or nishchit rup se yah dharna bhi nahin banani chahie ki agenciyon kaa upyog rajnatik pratishodh ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 FAST CHALLENGE With a deepening crisis in rural areas, India stands in the midst of a recession
 haalanki isi bich, anant narayan jaise aarthik tippaneekar bharat ke vaastavik samekit rajkoshiya ghate ko jidipi ke 9 se 10 pratishat ke bich hone ke anumaan laga rahe hai
 These numbers are alarming, especially because India's debt is no longer falling at high rates of inflation
 bharat ko apni viraasat kii samasyaon se nipatane ke liye rajkoshiya gunjaaish kii aavashyaktaa he, saath hi saath gramin kshetron main apane sabase jaruratmand nagarikon ke liye sansadhano ko lakshith karnaa hoga
 India will have to cut back on unnecessary spending, accept openly how big the fiscal challenge is and create a system that can improve our fiscal health in the medium term
 maang kamjor he, jiskaa saaf matlab he ki nijee kharchon ko adhik protsaahan dena hoga
 With tensions in the financial sector, monetary policy has limited impact
 rajkoshiya morche par baat karen to haal hi main hui korporate kar katautee se beshak share bazaar main ek choti avadhi ke liye teji ai lekin usase nivesh ko badhaava nahin mil saktaa kyonki kai duusari adchane hai
 Given the scarcity of resources, India should not immediately jump for a permanent tax cut for the urban middle class to boost consumer demand
 iske bajaae, vikaas ko teji dene vaale sudhaaron ko lagu karte hue vittiya sansadhano ko gramin kshetra ke garibon kii sahaayta ke liye sabase achche tareeke se istemaal karnaa hoga
 For example, this can be done by strengthening the MNREGA program and accelerating rural road construction
 agar madhyam avadhi main sarkari kharch ko rashtriya bachat ke anuroop rakhane kii aavashyaktaa ko samaj liya jaae to bharat adhik rajkoshiya gunjaaish nikaal saktaa he
 It will have to avoid easy methods, privatization will be meaningful only if it is well designed, but if a mutual fund buys government bonds or the government buys shares sold under privatization, it will not be reversed to mean that the government Wasting scarce national resources for spending
 isi tarah, sarkaar betahasha aakasmik dendariyon ko sweekaar nahin kar sakati, bina yah samajhe ki uskaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 For example, recently the bank deposit insurance was Rs 5 lakh per person
 tak badhaane ke prastaav ko hi len, jo lokapriy to hoga lekin apane saath baari dendaree bhi lekar aayega
 Increasing the limit of insurance on deposits will also increase deposits in weak cooperative banks and when those banks fail, the government will understand its cost
 iske bajaay, jamaa par beemaa kii raashi sahakaari bainkon kii karypranali main sudhaar ke anupaat main badhaai jaani chahie
 The great thing is that if India has to improve its fiscal health, it will have to keep a complete account of its contingent liabilities on all programs like food security and Ayushman Bharat
 Finally, India needs to set a credible roadmap and time frame
 , To which he will return to fiscal integrity
 etharabm samiti ke suzav ke mutabik, madhyam avadhi main saarvajanik rin ko lakshya kii seemaa main laane kii patibaddhta honi chahie or accounting ke taur-tareekon ko simit karne ke liye rajkoshiya parishad jaisi prahari sanstha kii sthapana kerani chahie, isi se yah tay ho paaegaa ki aaj kuch karne kii rajkoshiya gunjaaish nikle
 India has been postponing the process of fiscal balance whenever difficult choices have been made
 mahangaai se jude lakshyon ke saath bhi aisa hi hota rahaa he
 The government will have to make a deep and detailed brainstorm on how it can limit its future flexibility
 kam byaaj daron or rajkoshiya gunjaaish kaa tohfa vaaki acha hoga, kyonki mahangaai par ankush se bharat mudrasphiti ko kam rakhane or sthir vinimay dar hasil karne main sakasham rahaa he
 However, it is also necessary for the government to accept the institutional constraints associated with its steps
 rajnatik or saamaajik agendabahusankhyakwaad duniyabar main lokapriy he, or bharat apwaad nahin he
 Apart from inciting social tension, which India is not in a position to take risks, Hindu nationalism will divert the attention of the people away from economic development and this will increase social tension
 sarkaar ke rajnatik or saamaajik agenda ko uske aarthik agenda par haaavee hone dene ke bajaae, kya yah behatar nahin hoga ki rajnatik or saamaajik utthan kaa maarg aarthik khushhaali se prashast kiya jaae?hamaare alpsankhyakon ko samahit karne kaa sabase acha tarika yah hoga ki unhen achche skulon or utkrisht udaar collejon ke jariye bharat ke vaade ko puraa karne vaala behatar maarg dikhaaya jaae
 The best way to bring our marginalized states into the mainstream is to give them a strong justification for being a part of India and that they should better see their economic interests with the mainstream
 lekin iskaa matlab yah he ki bharat jis raste par chal rahaa he, usase itar rasta lenaa hoga
 With India's economic integration, it needs more political decentralization
 iskaa arth vibhinn aarthik niti vikalp bhi hai
 For example, instead of building giant statues of its national or religious heroes, India should build more modern schools and universities that can open up children's minds, make them more tolerant and respectful of each other and teach them the future Help make a mark in a competitive global world
 majboot samaveshi aarthik vikaas taqatvar ekajute bharat ke nirmaan ke agenda ko puraa karne kaa behatar tarika he
 India today has a powerful government, a charismatic popular prime minister
 vah aashaa kar saktaa he ki vikaas, samay rahete patari par lautega or aisa yakeenan hoga
 But this development will be much less than that which is the right of the youth of India
 ummid he, sarkaar aarthik diwaar par likhi ibaarat ko padhegi

 tripal talaak par supreme court main sunwaayee jari he
 At the outset, the Constitution Bench made it clear that the hearing was being held on only three divorces
 nikaah halaala par jarurat padane par hi charchaa hogi
 The court said that there would be no hearing on polygamy
 is dauraan chif justise ne teen sawaal kiye
 He asked that
 
 
 
 - Is triple talaq an integral part of Islam? - Can courts interfere in it, and should triple talaq be considered holy? - Is it infringing on basic rights? After this, lawyers of Central Government and Personal Law Board including Salman Khurshid Kept his side salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki talaak kii prakriya ek baar kii nahin teen maheene kii he
 Divorce process is three months - Triple divorce is not an issue, because it is necessary to try reconciliation between husband and wife before divorce
 - agar sulah kii koshish nahin hui to talaak vaid nahin mana ja saktaa
 - Not three divorces at once, but this process takes three months
 justise rohington ne khurshid se poocha- kya talaak se pehle sulah kii koshish kii baat kahin kodyphoid he?khurshid ne jawaab diya- nahin
 On behalf of the Personal Law Board, Kapil Sibal also supported Khurshid that triple talaq is not an issue
 is par supreme court ne poocha ki personal laa kya he? kya iskaa matlab shariat he yaa kuch or?personal lau board kii ore se kapil sibbal ne kaha, 'ye personal lau kaa maamla he
 The government can make laws but the court should not interfere in it
 vahiin justise courion ne kaha ki ye maamla moulik adhikaron se bhi judaa he
 After this, Justice Rohington asked the stand of the Central Government
 centre kii ore se ASG pinki anand ne kaha ki sarkaar yachikakarta ke samarthan main he
 Triple divorce is unconstitutional and many countries have abolished it
 dharm kaa hissaa hua to SC nahin degaa dakhalsupreme courtne kaha ki 'agar hamako ye lagata he ki teen talaak dharm kaa hissaa he to ham isamen dakhal nahin denge
 The anti-terrorism court, which is hearing against former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, on Friday adjourned the trial till March 21 in the case of detention of judges

 Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton took the 'responsibility' of failing to defend the attack on the US Consulate in Libya, airing a Republican attack on the White House before the presidential election
 is hamale main america rajdoot samet chaar america karmchaaree maare gaye the
 Hillary said in the Peruvian capital of Lima, 'I take responsibility
 
 
 
 i take it very privately
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ham isaki gaharaai main ja rahe hai or uske baad ham bhavishya main is prakaar kii karrwai ko rokane ke liye harsambhav karrwai kiye jane kii disha main badhenge
 And after that we will bring those responsible for this to justice
 ’pehle islam virdohi film ko jimmedaar tehraaya thahilari benghazi main america vaanijya duutavas par hue aatankwaadi hamale ke sambandh main kiye gaye sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahi thim
 Last month, US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other US personnel were killed in this attack
 obama prashasan ne shuruuaat main iske liye islam virdohi ek video film ko lekar hue hinsak pradarshnon ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 The administration later called it a terrorist attack
 pichley saptaah, up raashtrapati jo biden ne kaha ki white house ko benghazi main suraksha badhaane ke sambandh main kii gayi apilon ke bare main jaankaree nahin thi
 His statement was contrary to the statements of the staff of the State Department, which said that the appeal was made but it was rejected
 bebaak / vyangyaajkal phufaaon par khaskar whatsap par kai joke ban rahe hai or isaki prishthbhumi mere vichaar se raju shrivastav ne apane tivi kaaryakramon main dashak bhar pehle taiyaar kar di thi
 Thus, in Hindu families, he is a Vishnu form as a son-in-law, but sometimes flares up like Durvasa
 haalanki vidwaanon ne unke kabhi-kabhaar bhadak uthne ke kaarnon par sahi tareeke se vichaar nahin kiya he
 Puffers and warts are often ignored
 ramayana-mahabharat main bhi kaayade se phufaaon kaa zikr nahin miltaa
 Well, i think the following are the reasons why Indian puffers often flare-1
 umr ke saath sasuraal main vailu down hote janaa or chaay-pani tak kaa baar-baar aagrah na hona
 Actually, what happens at the time of marriage fades with time and after a decade of marriage, their status becomes like UPA-2
 unki aadaten or unki khubiyaan or kamajoriyaan sabake saamne saaf ho jaati hai or ghar kaa purana naukar bhi teen baar kehane par rajnigandha-tulsi laata he
 2
 jo patni unke liye shuruyaat main chhui-mui sareekhee hoti thi vah bhi samay bitne ke saath-saath du:saahsee hoti jaati he
 The children become young and the in-laws combine the wife, brother-in-law and children
 bechaare bujurg sasur bahadurshah jafar sa tukud-tukud takate rahete hai or foofaaji apane hi dal main adwani jaise ho jate hai
 3
 pachaas ke najadik pahunch rahe phufaaon ko mukhya compitishan ek peedi neeche se jijaaon se miltaa he
 When flamboyant, bright and iit-type brother-in-law comes in front of government employees or those who have reached the retirement threshold, it is natural to take away all the focus
 mithila main damaadon ko chappanbhog miltaa tha, pratik rup main abhi bhi bisiyon tarah ke vyanjan milte hai
 But, coming to the age of Fufa, they come on bhat-dal-tarkari
 chapatti main ghi yah kahkar manaa kar diya jaataa he ki sehat ke liye thik nahin he
 In such a situation, it is natural for fluffers to flare up like Yashwant Sinha
 4
 Previously, the number of rooms used to be low in marriage or any such big ceremony
 gaanv dehaat main nae damaadon ko cameraa mil jaataa tha lekin foofaaji ko pados main kisi ke yahaan yaa kahen ki nirmal verma kii kahaniyon main varnit dilli kii barsaati-numa jagahon main tikaa diya jaataa tha
 It is revealed that Fugazi is looking for toilet magga which Chintu has disappeared
 5
 In Mithila, fufaji (pizza) is often employed in non-productive works that are usually not accepted
 kuch kaaryon par gaur farmaaie
 For example, place it near the confectioner to take care of the food arrangements! Until recently, one or two people who go to get the bride, Fufa was considered suitable for her
 use maithili main ‘durgamania baryati’ kehete the-yani aisa baaraati jo gauna karaane ja rahaa ho
 When fufa used to reach the bride's house there, the people who surrounded her by making them breakfast and water used to get busy with the bride and groom
 us jamaane main na to data sasta tha or na hi jeeyo kaa network tha, foofa akele kudhate rahete the
 In the middle, if someone asked for tea, he did not ask or else the uncle used to spend that four-six hours as if there were passengers waiting for the trains running late in the cold hours at the railway station
 6
 There are some fufa who often engaged in their in-laws to get their years or years of children married
 unhen gumaan hota he ki ve is kaary ke liye sabase upyukt hai
 When their opinions are not taken or ignored, they flare up
 ek foofa to bas is baat ke liye naaraaz ho gaye kyonki unke hisaab se marketing banaras main na karke patna main kar lee gai
 7
 ek foofa isliye naaraaz ho gaye kyonki unhen bheed-bheed main tent house kaa marial-sa gadda or patala-sa takiya de diya gaya
 Whereas he had a week ago told his elder brother's son that he needed a home pillow
 8
 a puffed up angry just because he got a slightly less cold cold drink in the nineties
 9
 One of my friends got angry because while going to the elder brother's wedding, he was seated in an average car while the new son-in-law was given a good car
 10
 If you look closely at the history of Mughals, it is said that Emperor Akbar, after getting fed up with these actions of the rulers, stopped the marriage of Shahzadis
 darasal ye foofa, baghawat ko bhi uksaate the
 Overall, there is a need to understand the mood of the puffers properly
 bhale hi unhen maardarshak mandal main daal diya jaae par kabhi-kabhaar chaay-pani poochhate rahane se, janmdim main badhaiyaan dete rahane se phufaaon kaa bhi man bahalata rahata he
 By doing this, we will also be able to see properly the major problem of our aging population

 ) After 'aashiqui 2' and 'ABCD 2', Shraddha Kapoor, who is going to spread the magic of her acting in 'rock On 2', is becoming the 'queen of sequel films' but the actress says that she will be successful The decision to work in the sequel is not deliberate but she only pays attention to the good story and her character in the film

 Meet four neighbors Sejyoti Kumar: Jyoti Kumar is from Masood in Bihar
 unke pita ek maamuli chaparasi hai
 Shivani Durga: Shivani of Noida is a spiritual teacher
 mekars kii ore se sho kaa jo promo jari hua he usamen vah kahati najar aa rahi hai ki 'ek talab kii machhlee gandi he to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki puraa talab hi ganda ho
 'sapna Choudhary: She is the stage dancer of Haryana
 wo kisi celibrity se kam nahin hai
 His name has come up in many controversies
 jubair khan :sabase mjedaar naam hasina parkar kaa damaad he
 The promo shows that Dawood's nephew Zubair is also joining the show
 film kaa naam:saat uchakkediarector:sanjeev sharmaster cast:manoj bajpeyi, ke ke menon, vijay raaj, aditi sharma, annu kapur, anupam kheivadhi:2 ghanta 19 minutesrtificate: aretimga:2 starasanjeev sharma ne ek geetkaar or riter ke rup main bahut saare kaam kiye hai lekin pehali baar hindi film ke diarection main kadam rakhkar film 'saat uchakke' diarect kii he
 Let's know how this film is: Story: The story of the film starts in a madhouse and ends in the mansion of Diwan Saheb (anupam Kher) of Old Delhi
 film main pappi jat (manoj bajpeyi) apane doston haggu, khappe, ajji ,babbe, or jaggi tirachha (vijay raaj ) ke saath ek khajaane ko luutane kaa plan banaata he
 Girlfriend Sona (aditi Sharma) also joins him to help her
 in sabhi ko pareshaan karne vaala ek hi police vaala he jiskaa naam tejpal rathi (ke ke menon) he
 Bitchi (annu Kapoor) also has an important role in the film
 ab kya pappi jat apane giroh ke saath khajaana lut paane main safal ho paata he, iskaa pataa aapako film dekhakar hi chalegaa
 Know what is the weak link of the film: 1- The weak link of the film is its writing in which the one liners laugh but it seems difficult to cope with it for 2 hours and 19 minutes
 screenple or editing ko thodaa or behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 2- The casting of the film also looks fishy
 khaas taur se anupam kher or annu kapur kii maujuudagi se film kaaphi laud lagane lagati he
 If someone else had been cast in their place, perhaps the film would have looked better
 3- film main tipical gali ke ladakon vaali gaaliyon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he jo shaayad sabhi ko pasand naa aaye
 4- The film can prove to be especially effective for the filmmaking students because after all, the education provided by the film has also been told, but there is little spice for the general public
 3 points main jaane kii ye film kyon dekh sakate hai:1
 Great actors like Manoj Bajpayee, KK Menon and Vijay Raj have left no stone unturned in acting once again
 vahiin, aditi sharma ne bhi behtareen acting kii he
 There are a lot of scenes shown in which sometimes you can also laugh laughter 2
 agar aap dilli ke rahane vaale hai or khaas taur se puraani dilli ke, to aapako vahaan kaa thodaa flavor jarur milegaa
 3
 film main 'najar laagi raja' or 'chhap tilak' jaise loakgeet behtareen tareeke se dikhaae gaye hai
 Box Office: The film was ready a year ago but much effort was being made to get the censor certificate
 marketing or pramotion ke saath film kii laagat lagbhag 12 karod rupee bataai ja rahi he
 It will be special to see how much profit or loss the film will make at the box office
 dilli vakf board ne javahlaal nehru uniwarsity (jeenyu) se teen saal pehle gaayab chaatr najeeb kii maa ko 5 lakh rupye kii aarthik sahaayta di
 With this, Najeeb's younger brother Hasib was given a confirmed job in the Delhi Waqf Board
 najeeb kii maa somvaar kii dopaher board offis pahunchi thim
 Delhi Waqf Board Chairman Amanatullah Khan gave a check of Rs 5 lakh as financial aid to Bilkis Bano, mother of missing student Najeeb and offered a job in Delhi Waqf Board to his son Haseeb, who is an engineer, which he accepted took
 amanatullah khan bole- samajhate hai maa kii chintamedia se baat karte hue amanatullah khan ne kaha ki najeeb, jo kai saal pehle jeenyu se laapata ho gaya thaor jinaki abhi tak pahchaan nahin hui he, unki chintaaon ko ham samajhate hai or dard main samaan rup se shaamil hai

 telecom vibhaag or unic identification athurity of india (yuidiai,adharpraadhikaran) ne guuruuvaar ko ek sanyukt bayaan jari kar logon ko aashwast kiya ki aadhaar ke kaaran logon ke phone band nahin honge
 The statement said that some media reports that the reports of 500 million people getting off their phones are being completely imaginary and untrue
 kuch din pehle supreme court ne aadhaar maamle main sunwaayee karte hue aadesh diya tha ki mobile companiyaan yugers kii pahchaan ke liye aadhaar number kaa istemaal nahin kar saktin
 While the condition is that more than 50 crore numbers are running on the basis
 media main aisi khabaren ai thim ki doosraa koi vaid document jamaa na karaane par aadhaar hatane ke saath hi mobile number band ho sakate hai
 While issuing a joint statement, it was told that the number of 500 million mobile users in the media is being called off, which is almost half of the total mobile number in the country
 aisa kabhi ho hi nahin saktaa ki aadhe se zyada conection band kar die jaaen
 This is absolutely wrong news
 media ke kuch dhade main khabar chali thi ki desh ke 50 karod mobile yugers ke number jald hi band ho sakate hai
 This danger is for the mobile users who did not provide any other identity card other than Aadhaar card to collect the number
 aise main keval aadhaar card dekar mobile conection lene vaale logon ko naikevaisikarani hogi
 After the decision of the Supreme Court, it is believed that mobile companies will have to remove the base of users
 aise main yugers ko apana alag koi pahchaan patr dekar kevaisi karaani hogi
 The Aadhaar Authority has ordered mobile companies to follow the Supreme Court order till 15 October
 15 ke baad aadhaar se mobile number kaa satyaapan nahin hoga

 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) party chief Lalu Yadav is in jail as his control over the party is becoming weaker
 is bich argedy main tejasvi yadav ko rashtriya adhyaksh banane kii maang uthne lagi he
 Most of the party's mlas believe that due to national president Lalu Prasad Yadav being in jail, the functioning of the party is being affected, in such a situation, the need for a full-time national president is felt
 2 vidhayakon kaa tejasvi ko samarthanparty ke varisht vidhayak bhai virendra kaa kahana he ki party ko lalu prasad yadav kaa aashirwad or maargdarshan miltaa rahegaa lekin tejasvi yadav ko rashtriya adhyaksh bananaa aaj kii yuva kii maang he
 Another RJD MLA and former Minister of State Vijay Prakash believes that the national president can take a decision as Lalu Prasad Yadav thinks fit
 tejasvi yadav to party ko sambhaal hi rahe hai
 In the meantime, on 16 August (friday) last week, there was an important meeting of all the party mlas, councilors, current and former district heads at 10 Circular Road, the official residence of former Chief Minister Rabri Devi
 haalanki is baithak main argedy netaa tejasvi yadav, tej pratap yadav or misa bharti ko bhi shaamil hona tha lekin vah teenon baithak main shaamil hone nahin pahunche

 On Shivanand's advice, however, regarding the disappearance of Tejashwi Yadav from this important meeting, senior party leader Shivanand Tiwari said that party leaders and workers expect that they should attend such meetings
 jabaki party ke purv saansad or varisht netaa raghuvansh prasad singh ne bhi baithak main argedy kii tut kii khabaron ko lekar party vidhayakon kii parade karaane se judi khabaron ko bebuniyaad tehraaya tha
 Defending Tejashwi, Raghuvansh Prasad said that Tejashwi Yadav is not present in the meeting, which means that he is busy with party work elsewhere

 unhone dakshin africa se lautne ke baad 1 agast, 1920 ko pehla rashtravyapee satyagrah chhedakar aazaadee ke sangharsh main krantikari badlaav laa diya
 In the Satyagraha, he inspired millions of illiterate farmers and sharp intellectuals to follow his belief that the country would either get freedom from British colonial terror or Swaraj after one year due to fear-free austerity
 bhale hi yah sab us teji se to mumkin na hua ho, lekin gandhi ne satya or ahimsa main apane bharose ko kabhi digne nahin diya

 Mahatma Gandhi was the only one among the big leaders of the country who strenuously refused to accept the partition of the country
 unhone use bharat mata ke tukade karne ke baraabar aanka tha
 Gandhi knew that the hasty division of Punjab and Bengal in this way would cause rivers of blood to flow in the land of the most prosperous and pious Sikhs, and in the gurdwaras of Punjab, and on the other side, in Shasonar Banglaya

 Have you ever gone on a road trip? i have gone once but not with Dad but with friends
 ek hi vakt par aap 'piku''tamaasha'or 'bajrav mastaani' kii shooting kar rahi thi, kaise?ji wo jab ham costum, or reharsal karte hai to automatic usee maahaul main chale jate hai, to alag-alag filmein ek hi vakt par karte rahanaa koi rocket science nahin he
 Amitabh Bachchan has given you the name 'deepikku'? Jee, it was very surprising, and the laugh came during the joke
 amitabh ji ne yah naam diya, kaaphi acha laga
 During shooting, is there any place in India that you would like to go to? i have to go to the forest areas like Ranthambore to see the forest life there
 film ke dauraan kya-kya siikhaa aapane?jab bhi main kolkata jaati hum to mujhe lagata he ki yah kaaphi kareebi shahar he
 i also used to go during modeling and still go today
 vahaan kii bhashaa bhi jaanane or seekhney ko milti he
 The trains, old buildings there are still very well maintained
 'om shanti om' kii shanti se ab 'piku' tak ke safar main aap apane bare main chhapane vaali khabaron ko kaise leti hai?bilkul pehle jaise hi leti hum, kabhi acha lagata he, kabhi bura lagata he ,lekin main apane kaam par zyada focus karti hum
 What is your routine like? Breakfast is a must in my routine everyday
 sokar uthne ke aadhe ghante ke bheetar mujhe naashtaa chahie hi chahie jaise dosa upama vagairah
 i eat all kinds of food with great fervor
 aane vaali filmon kaa kya states he?'tamaasha' taiyaar he, ho saktaa he is saal relies ho jaae or 'bajirao' bhi isi saal relies hogi

 itihaas ke aaine main darj in kisson par najar daudaayenge to shaayad pataa chale ki is kahani main kitna yatharth or kitna myth he?itihaas ke tathyon ke mutabik, khilji ne 1303 main chittod par hamalaa kiya tha, jahaan ke raja ratnasingh kii patni kaa naam padmini tha
 The same facts of Jayasi's story are found in history, the rest was considered the imagination of the poet
 ab jaraa ek british adhikari jecwas tod (1782-1835) kii raay bhi padhein
 Tod told a story in accounts heard from the bards of Rajasthan
 tod ke yahaan ratnasen kaa naam bhim singh he, padmavati kaa naam padmini or uske pita or sinhaladesh ke raja kaa naam gandharvasen kii bajaae hammir he
 The story is such that upon hearing about the appearance of Padmini, Khilji marched on Chittor
 bhayankar yuddh ke baad bhi koi parinaam na nikalne par khilji ne sandhi prastaav bhijwaya ki use bas ek baar padmini kaa rup dekh lene diya jaae
 Thus the war came to a halt and he was shown the image of Padmini in a mirror

 He has written the name of the country of the Mongols 'harev'
 allaudin ke samay main mongolon ke kai akraman hue the jinamein sabase jabardast hamalaa 1303 main hua tha
 Alauddin ascended Chittor in 1303
 " allaudin chittod garh ko ghere hue he, isi bich main dilli se chitthee aati haih"ehi vidhi dheel dinh tab tain! dilli ten aradaasain ain
 Pichhiun Harev Dinhi who is the chair, who now ascended the lamp

 "lekin sochane vaali baat yah he ki kya ramchandra shukla ke is udhaaharan se yah anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki jaaysi apane baaki varnanon main, bhi tathyon ko lekar utane hi durust honge?haalanki vartmaan main jaaysi ke padmavat kii nayika padmavati par vivaad khadaa hua he
