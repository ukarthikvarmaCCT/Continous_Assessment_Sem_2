 bihar main aisa kuch hua he kya ki 5 din ke bheetar pradhanmantri modi kii sabha ke ant main lagane vaale naare se vande maataram kaa naaraa hi gaayab ho gaya
 Was this done by seeing Nitish Kumar's discomfort, if not, the proof will be found in Bagaha rally on May 4 when both the Prime Minister and Nitish Kumar will hold a joint rally
 hamane somvaar ke prime time main dikhaaya tha ki 25 april ko darbhanga main pradhanmantri ne bharat mata kii jai or vande maataram ke zordaar naare lagaae lekin mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne naaraa nahin lagaaya or haath bhi nahin uthaaya
 While all the leaders present on the stage were raising slogans of Vande Mataram by raising their hands even to Ram Vilas Paswan
 uske 5 din baad yani 30 april ko muzaffarpur main endie kii raily hoti he
 At that rally, the Prime Minister finally raised the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai but left the slogan of Vande Mataram
 bharat mata kii jai ke naare ke tevar main bhi antar tha
 People were not raising their hands on the stage and Nitish Kumar, who was present there, was sitting quietly
 jaise wo in naaron se apni raajnneetik duuri banaae rakhana chaahate hon
 The Prime Minister does not raise the slogan of Vande Mataram
 darbhanga kaa video bataata he ki sahyogi hote hue bhi koi dal aasaani se apni raajnneeti nahin chodta he
 Video from Muzaffarpur suggests that BJP may even drop a slogan for its ally
 kya pradhanmantri modi ne ranneeti ke tahat muzaffarpur main vande maataram kaa naaraa nahin lagaaya
 We checked the end of seven rallies of the Prime Minister
 bhaashan ke ant main unhone bharat mata kii jai or vande maataram kaa naaraa lagaaya he
 They mention Vande Mataram in the speeches of Bengal
 beshak kai bhaashanon kaa ant ve donon naaron se nahin karte hai
 Do it in some other way also
 ant bhale na karen lekin bhaashan main vande maataram aa hi jaataa he
 In the rally in Darbhanga, where Nitish Kumar did not raise the slogan of Vande Mataram, in the same rally, the Prime Minister gave a speech about Vande Mataram, in which he said that people who have problems with the slogan of Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata Ki Jai, should get their bail seized
 
 ab pradhanmantri hi bataa sakate hai ki phir ve mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke bare main is maamle ko lekar kya raay rakhte hai
 Do they give separate exemption to Nitish Kumar which they would not like to give to Azam Khan or Mehbooba Mufti
 unhen yah bataanaa chahie ki bijepi ne mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii is chuppi par kuch kyon nahin kaha
 Prime Minister Modi should also tell that the slogan of Vande Mataram in Muzaffarpur was not raised because Nitish Kumar was present there
 kya vandemataram ke naare se bijepi itnaa edjust kar sakati he
 After 2014, listen to the news channels Vande Mataram has spoken to his spokespersons, go to You Tube again
 bijepi ke pravaktaaon ke twitor handle par jaakar dekhie ki ve is par kya bolte hai
 Are you able to speak anything? kolkata ke paas barrackpore kii raily main pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki aapako unhen vot nahin dena chahie jo bharat mata kii jai or vande maataram bolne se pehle sau baar sochate hai
 Vande targets Mamata for Mataram, but the prime minister leaves Nitish Kumar
 vande maataram kaa raajnneetikaran is mode par pahonchega, raajnneeti karne waalon ne bhi nahin sochaa hoga
 He has the facility that the media is taking care of his convenience on this matter and leaving
 susheel mahapatra ne jediu ke varisht netaa ke si tyaagi se baat kii
 Casey Tyagi is a leader who speaks openly
 unhone saaf-saaf kaha ki endie kii raily main vande maataram or bharat mata kii jai ke naare nahin lagane chahie
 This slogan is of Jana Sangh and BJP
 ke si tyaagi ne kaha ki vande maataram or bharat mata kii jai endie ke kaarykram kaa hissaa nahin he
 After watching this interview, will the Prime Minister be able to say that you do not vote for JDU, because JDU is opposed to Vande Mataram at NDA rally
 lekin kasee tyaagi to saaf saaf kah rahe hai ki vande maataram ko endie kii raily se dur rakhana chahie
 Nitish Kumar's separation of himself from the slogans of Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata Ki Jai is an interesting political event
 bijepi ke saath gathbandhan ke baad bhi nitish kumaar kaa vande maataram or bharat mata kii jai ko lekar gathbandhan nahin hua he
 Of course they have changed partners for politics but politics has not changed
 kuch bachaakar rakhi he
 Nitish Kumar's stature is that BJP is not saying anything on this issue
 4 may yani shanivaar ko bihar ke bagaha main pradhanmantri or nitish kumaar kii raily hone vaali he
 Now everyone's eyes are on the rally whether at the end of the speech the Prime Minister will loudly chant the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai and Vande Mataram and whether Nitish Kumar will be silent again
 naaraa nahin lagaayenge
 Our colleague Habib spoke to BJP MLA and spokesperson Nitin Naveen
 aap jawaab ko thik se suniye
 If there was no pressure of coalition politics, BJP leaders would have picked up the sky as soon as the name of Vande Mataram came, but the answer is that the tongue is not coming
 rashtriya janata dal ke netaa tejasvi yadav ne bhi vande maataram vaale prasang par twit kiya he
 His party leader Shivanand Tiwari says what would have happened if Abdul Bari had been Siddiqui on that stage and not raised his hands during Vande Mataram
 kya bijepi chup rah jaati
 If the same statement would have been to Shahid Siddiqui that Vande would not have raised the slogan of Mataram, you would have seen how aggressive the statements of BJP leaders would have been
 vaise shahid siddiki ko vande maataram se etraz nahin he
 In Bihar, JDU has tied up with BJP but BJP has left 5 seats won for JDU
 ab kya bijepi jediu ke liye endie ke manch se vande maataram kaa naaraa bhi chhod degi? 4 may ko bagaha kii raily main pataa chalegaa
 Even Giriraj Singh is not speaking, who does not want to give even a community a grave for not speaking Vande Mataram
 jis bayaan ke kaaran chunaav ayog ne sensor kiya tha
 Every coalition is compromised with principles, but even in this fiercely negotiated phase, JDU is firm on its policies
 bijepi kahati he ki dhara 370 samaapt kar denge
 Common Civil Code
 bihar main charchaa aam he ki jediu ne apana ghoshnaa patr isliye nahin laayaa kyonki tab yah likhnaa padataa ki ham dhara 370 hataane ke paksh main nahin hai or phir tivi waalon ko dibet karnaa pad jaataa
 At the behest of Omar Abdullah, he gets debated but Nitish's opposition gets rebate
 chhot mil jaati he
 If the Prime Minister in Muzaffarpur has helped Nitish Kumar by not raising the slogan of Vande Mataram, then Nitish Kumar is also helping Prime Minister Modi by not releasing the manifesto
 yah sawaal nahin puch kar twitor or tivi vaale bhi donon kii madad kar rahe hai
 KC Tyagi also says that one should not ask for votes in the name of the army
 unhone yah bhi tareeke se kah diya ki chunaav ayog ko tatasth hona chahie
 Decisions should be taken without discrimination
 ab ham kuch nahin kahana chaahate hai
 BJP should tell what it wants to say about JDU
 kya pradhanmantri 4 may ko hone vaali bagaha hi raily main vande maataram or bharat mata kii jai chhod denge
 And if imposed, will Nitish Kumar leave his stage
 pradhanmantri ne is baar nayaa style apanaaya he
 They are also appealing to writers and journalists to call themselves Chowkidars
 apni sabha main ve sabase naare lagane ke liye kehete hai
 Next time you go to their meeting, keep an eye on the camera team standing behind how many journalists are chanting the watchman with them
 apni ankhon se dekha kiijie

 ek taraf bharat sarkaar logon se apana aadhaar card banavaane or use jaruri servison ke saath jodne kii apil kar rahi he
 On the other hand, people related to Aadhaar are being leaked from government websites
 sarkaar ne aadhaar ko lagbhag sabhi servison ke liye jaruri karne kii taiyaari kii he
 According to latest research, about 135 million transfusion numbers may have been leaked online from the government database
 is research di centre for internet and socity (CIS) ne karaayaa he
 This agency has published this research under the name Information Security Practice Offer
 report ke mutabik sarkari portels ne lagbhag 135 million bhartiya nagarikon ke aadhaar number online ko public kar diya
 That is, anyone can access it
 jaahir he aise main aadhaar number ke galat yuj kaa bhi khatra hota he
 Four government websites including MNREGA, Social Assistance Program, Daily Online Payment Report and Chandran Insurance Scheme website
 report ke mutabik in websites par yugers ke aadhaar number or phinantial jaankaree jaise bank acount detel ko public kar diya jise koi bhi acces kar saktaa he
 According to the report, sensitive information such as job card number, bank account number, Aadhaar card number and account status of pension holders are available on the website of National Social Assistance Program
 lekin kamjor security kii vajah se yah duniya ke kisi bhi insaan ke liye uplabdh ho gai
 All sensitive information can be obtained with just a few clicks
 haal hi main jharkhand sarkaar kii ek website par lakhon aadhaar card holders kii jaankariyaan li ho gayi
 Apart from this, the Aadhaar card details of students who got scholarships on the official website of many states were leaked
 google search ke jariye sirf kuch kiwards yuj karke ditels koi bhi dhund kar galat yuj kar saktaa he
 This research report states that the Aadhaar number, caste, religion, address, photographs and user's economic information, being public in this way, shows how poorly it has been implemented
 haal hi main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kii website se aise data axel shit aasaani se google ke jariye downlod kii ja sakati thi
 You may miss it or carelessness, but anyone can even have the address of so many citizens
 kya aadhaar number ko public karnaa sahi he?aadhaar act 2016 ke mutabik kisi naagarik kaa aadhaar data publish nahin kiya ja saktaa
 That is, the website of the ministry is failing to keep these data secure
 aadhaar act 2016 ke tahat colect kiya gaya koi bhi aadhaar number yaa kor biometric information public nahin kiya ja saktaa or na hi ise kisi public placeform par post kiya ja saktaa he
 However, it can be used by agencies and institutions covered under the law
 di vir kii ek report ke mutabik ek maheene pehle data research shrinivas kodali ne third party website ke dwaara galati li kiye gaye 5-6 lakh logon ke personal data ke bare main bataaya tha

 sarkaar ke hameshaa daawa karti he ki aadhaar sicyor haisarkaar lagaataar daawa karti he ki aadhaar sicyor he sef he or data li nahin ho rahe hai
 But these incidents are proving hollow in those claims
 sawaal yah he ki ab is report ke baad sarkaar koi kathor kadam uthaati he yaa phir pehle kii tarah lachar suraksha bani rahegi

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne shikshakon ke liye 'prerana ap' or 'prerana web portal' launch kiya
 The presence of teachers in the school will be registered through this app
 yani shikshakon ko apni upasthiti darj karaane ke liye skool ke saamne apni din main 3 baar selfi leni hogi
 As soon as the teachers got information about this app, they were unhappy about registering with the Prerna app
 jiske baad ap ko lekar upi ke kai shikshakon ne virodh pradarshan shuru kar diya
 The teachers protested on the road yesterday
 saath hi sarkaar se kaha ki vah ye niyam waapas le len
 Let me tell you, with the launch of 'prerna App' and 'prerna Web Portal', it was made necessary that teachers pull their selfies 3 times a day and upload them on these portals
 shikshakon kaa kahana he ki jab mantri, vidhayak, dm, saansad samet kai oonche padon par kaary kar rahe hai log selfi lekar hajiri nahin de rahe hai to hamase kyon kaha ja rahaa he? vahiin sarkaar ne kaa kahana he ki kai shikshak padhaane main laaparvaahee baratate hai aise main ye niyam jaruri he
 Know what is the 3 selfie funda on 'pranpa App' and 'prerna Web Portal' Now primary teachers will have to take selfie three times a day, morning and afternoon
 selfi kuch is tarah kii leni hogi ki peeche skool dikhe
 Let us tell you, in the afternoon children will have to take selfie while feeding the mid day meal, while after school holiday one must take selfie with the students
 shikshakon kaa kahana he ki jahaan sarkaar is baat kaa daawa karti he ki skulon main pehle se behatar shiksha di ja rahi he vahiin aise niyam laakar shikshakon ko maansik rup se pratadit bhi kar rahi he
 In this case, the solution of this thing should be taken as soon as possible
 kya he is ap main khasis ap kii khaas baat yah bhi he ki yah selfi lete vakt adhyaaapak kii lokation bhi bataaegi, or to or ek hi selfi ko dobaaraa bhejne par bhi ap se pataa chal jayega
 Although on the very first day of the launch, there have been complaints of this app being messed up in many places, yet many people have sent selfies of school attendance through this app
 adhyapakon ne kaha- isse bad rahaa bojis nai vyavastha ko lekar adhyapakon main pehle se bhi gussa he
 Teachers believe that along with the workload of the government, they are gradually incurring such things which they themselves have to bear
 adhyapakon ke group main faisla kiya he ki vah iskaa virodh karenge or jab tak ki sarkaar unhen kisi bhi sarkari kaam ke liye koi bhatta yaa phir mobile kaa intjaam karke nahin detii
 Till then, we will not send information to the government through our private mobiles
 haalanki shikshak diwas par bolte hue yogi adityanath main adhyapakon ko kai tarah ke kaamon kaa paath padhaayaa
 Yogi called upon the Principal of all schools in Adityanath to take initiative to keep discipline and cleanliness in his school exclusively
 agar unke skulon main ped paudhe jo ki puraane ho chuke hai, or bade hai unki vajah se koi gandagi yaa avyavashtha fail rahi he to unako hataakar skool kii saaf safai rakrakhaav kaa prabandh karen
 Yogi also told the teachers in Adityanath, 'he should take initiative on his behalf and work to improve the schools
 skulon kii marammat choti-moti chizon kaa intjaam yahaan tak rangai putai bhi shaamil he
 There is resentment within the teachers about all these things and they are deciding to oppose it in the coming days

 ) chhattisgarh main shikshakarmiyon ne sarkari skulon main padhai likhaai thapp kar di he
 About 3 years ago, the education workers went on strike indefinitely and played with the future of millions of students
 aaj phir vahi sthiti ban gayi he
 That too when the government takes an affidavit from the education workers before their appointment that they will not strike nor any work which affects the education system after joining the job
 bharat sarkaar ke sarv shiksha abhiyaan se milane vaali aarthik sahaayta se berozegaron ko rojgaar muhaiyaa karaate hue shikshakarmi ke pad par rajya bhar main tainaati di gayi thi
 For a few months, the educationists followed the rules under their affidavits, but as soon as their organizations were formed and those organizations got political air, all the education workers have come together to persuade their unreasonable demands
 udhar rajnatik laabh haani ke samikarnon ko dhyaan main rakh karsarkaarabhi unki haa main haa milaane lagi
 Now these education workers are full of government
 yahi nahin unke hadtaal par chale jane se lakhon chaatro or unke abhibhavakon ke saamne padhai likhaai ko lekar maathaa pachchi shuru ho gayi he
 It is not known when the strike will end, but the question of the safety and security of children has been raised in government schools

 Education workers' organizations have gone on strike demanding their 9-point demands
 unke mutabik yadi sarkaar unki maang puri nahin karti to ve hadtaal jari rakhenge
 Shikshakarmis have a special contribution in the education system of primary, middle and high school in Chhattisgarh

 By drawing agitation for almost two months, neither the school children could complete the syllabus nor could they get good results in the examinations

 Such a situation has been created again

 According to Sanjay Sharma, president of the United Front of Education Workers, there has been a demand for equal pay for equal work for a long time
 ve saamaanya shikshakon ke anuroop kaam karte hai, lekin unki tulana main shikshakarmiyon kaa vetan lagbhag aadha he
 On the very first day of the strike, work like reading and writing and mid-day meal were effected in all government schools of the state
 adhikansh skulon main chuttee jaisaa maahaul rahaa
 The government currently has no alternative system to deal with the strike

 In a garage in Meerut, 22-year-old Sameer, a mechanic, spends most of his earnings on fashion
 uskaa shauk ladakiyon se dosti karnaa bhi tha
 Most of his attempts were to trap Hindu girls in his love trap
 vah apana naam hameshaa hinduon vaala hi bataata or pahchaan badalakar ladakiyon se miltaa tha
 One day his heart fell on Renu, a girl student of Meerut
 usne renu ko apana naam susheel bataaya
 Both of them fell in love and Renu became pregnant
 jab samir ne uske saamne nikaah kaa prastaav rakhaa tab renu ko pataa chalaa ki vah susheel nahin, samir he
 Sameer tricked him emotionally and drove him home
 renu ke pita ne police main shikaayat kii magar renu ke samir ke paksh main bayaan dene ke baad maamla band ho gaya he
 Today Renu alias Mumtaz and Sameer are living in Assam
 unka ek baccha bhi he
 From the above, inter-religious love marriages are seen and such cases have increased rapidly in Uttar Pradesh, the largest state of the country
 pashchimi uttar pradesh ke kai jilon khaas taur par meerut, mujffarnagar, bulandshahr, bagpat, saharanpur or muradabad main bilkul vaise hi ho rahaa he jaise ki kerala or dakshin bharat ke kai rajyon main hota rahaa he
 Within two months in Meerut alone, there have been nine cases in which Muslim boys have seduced Hindu girls
 kai jagah maamla sampradayik tool pakad chukaa tha magar ilaake ke bade-bujurgo ke bich-bachaav ke baad sab kuch thik ho gaya
 Some people and police-administration are also giving it the name of 'loving Jihad'
 khufia vibhaag ke adhikari bataate hai ki puure desh main is tarah ke muslim ladke hai jo sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat hindu ladakiyon ko apana shikaar banaate hai
 These officials say that some clerics brainwash Muslim boys under the guise of religion and deepen their minds that Hindu girls will be destined to have children by implicating them in love and having children He will be kind to them because in this way they will expand Islam
 baahar ke mulkon se in ladakon ko kinhin or jariye se paisa miltaa he or saundarya prashaadhan kii chijen bhi milti hai jinhen ve ladakiyon ko tohfe ke rup main dete hai
 Police officials say that these Romeo-type boys keep circling around girl schools on motorbikes
 ye apane haathon main kalava (mauli) baandhe rakhte hai or apane naam hinduon se milte-julate rakh lete hai-jaise pappu, munna, samir, bobi, kallu, chunna aadi
 These Muslim boys keep their standard of living very high for appearance
 so, samir sareekhe or bhi ladakon ke maamle saamne aae hai-shakeel, unuus, aarif, asif or ajam jaise, jo target karke hindu ladakiyon ko apane premjaal main fansaate hai
 Especially among the Hindu and Christian sections of Saharanpur, it has become deeply ingrained that non-muslim girls are not safe in the areas where there is a large number of Muslims
 muslim ladke hindu ladakiyon ke saath dosti karne or phir pyaar kii pinge badhaane ke saath hi unka bhaavnaatmak shoshan karke kisi bhi keemat par unase shaadi karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Kamsin girls do not understand their tricks and are caught in their trap
 kai baar to ye ladkiyaan un ladakon ke pyaar main is kadar pagal ho jaati hai ki kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar ho jaati hai, haalanki tab tak unhen yah nahin pataa hota he ki unka premi muslim he
 She takes steps like running away from home
 kai maamalon main ladki ke naaballig hone kii vajah se maa-baap police main report darj karaate hai
 Fearing slander in the society, parents try to get the matter resolved out of court
 bulandshahr main aisa hi ek maamla saamne aayaa
 15-year-old Sulekha, a ninth grade student, used to go to school with her friends
 jibrahan urf bablu apane doston shakeel, guddu or raju ke saath bike se uskaa peechha kiya karata tha
 As Sulekha was a girl from Valmiki family and used to worship a lot
 uske maathe par hameshaa roli kaa tikaa laga rahata tha jise dekhne ke baad jibrahan ne apana naam hameshaa bablu hi bataaya or haath main kalava baandh ke hi usase miltaa tha
 He started sending Sulekha's friends with expensive-looking gifts, etc
 phir sulekha bhi jibrahan se milane ke bahaane khojane lagi or dhire-dhire dosti pyaar main badal gai or chah maah baad hi jibrahan ke kehane par vah ghar se bhaagane ko taiyaar ho gai
 His family complained to the police and a case was registered against Jibrahan
 sulekha ko police ne khoj nikaala or uske gharavaalon ke supurd kar diya, jibrahan abhi jail main he
 Sulekha is married by her family members in Meerut
 sulekha ne khud bataaya ki jibrahan zyaadaatar samay usase islam se judi baaten hi karata tha
 When she was completely mad for him, she also prayed and started keeping fast
 aaj sulekha ko jibrahan se uskaa pyaar karnaa galat lagata he or vah ise apni jindagi kii ek badi galati maanati he
 However, Muslim religious leaders completely reject this definition of Loving Jihad
 shiya dharmaguru kalbe javwaad kaa kahana he ki prem kaa koi majahab nahin hota
 Anyone, anytime, anywhere can find someone good
 ise majahabi deevaaren nahin roak saktin
 Such allegations are baseless and with the aim of inciting religious sentiment, some people are propagating such things
 lekin kai log, khaas taur se kattarpanthi hindu gut is tarah kii ghatnaon ko luving jihad hi maanate hai
 According to him, the kind of language used in madrasas plays an important role in instigating people's feelings
 india today ne khud jaakar kai madrason main dekha
 Particularly during the Friday prayers in Deoband, the language that was used in the speech (speech), the language used in it would be called inflammatory
 vishwa hindu mahasang ke upaadhyaksh mahant surendra nath avadhoot kehete hai ki dharmik kattarta kaa paath padhaanaa galat he
 Muslim boys trap Hindu girls in their love trap and ruin their lives and leave them
 prem main nishtha or samarpan hona chahie jabaki in maamalon main isaki jagah aakrosh or vidroh le letaa he
 These boys enjoy the patronage of Muslim religious leaders and it is on their instigation that some Muslim boys implicate Hindu girls in the trap of their love
 jab tak ladki ko sachaai kaa pataa chalata he tab tak der ho chuki hoti he
 If they truly love then there is nothing wrong but they want to break and disintegrate our social structure which will not be tolerated at any cost
 yah poochne par ki jab kabhi bhi is tarah kii koi ghatana saamne aati he ki muslim ladkaa hindu ladki ko bahala-phusalaakar bhaga le gaya to bajrang dal or shivasena jaise kattar dharmik sanghathan jo marpet or todphod kii ghatnaon ko anjaam dete hai, kya vah sahi he, surendra nath kaa kahana tha ki apni dharmik sampada kii raksha to kerani hi chahie
 Something has to be done to save it and to remove the dirt that is spreading in the society
 ye pratikriyaayein usee kram main hoti hai
 The police-administration is also concerned about the growing cases of this Romeo Jihad or Love Jihad
 haalanki abhi tak luving jihad ke chalate kisi bhi ilaake main koi apriy ghatana nahin ghati he magar kai ilaakon main tanaav jarur paidaa ho gaya tha
 a similar incident took place in Bulandshahr on February 14, 2009, in which Ashraf, Akram, Aslam, nephew of city MLA Haji Alim, and Sonam, a girl from Faizul Hasan area, rushed to lure Sonam, causing tension in the entire area

 But in the cases that have been filed, it is clearly written at many places that this case looks like Loving Jihad

 surya namaskara ko ham vivaad ke zariye hi jaanane lage hai
 If we ask in depth about the Surya Namaskar from the so-called supporters and opponents who are involved in this controversy, then many people may give teeth
 daant chiar bhojpuri kaa shabd he, jiskaa matlab he, awak ho janaa
 Become awesome surya namaskara karnaa or iske bare main jaananaa donon hi aapako dilachasp yatraaon par le jaataa he
 Your body becomes active even when it is stable
 surya namaskara ko kisi yogya guru kii sangat main hi siikhaa janaa chahie
 Nowadays, many popular gurus open the institute and give yoga teacher's degree in a ten-day course
 aise agyani guruon se sarvatha bachiye
 i was trying for a long time to get a separate book on Surya Namaskar in Hindi
 hazaron pannon kii mul kitaaben padhane ke baad swami satyanand saraswati kii likhi pustak mili he
 It has been published by Bihar Yog Vidya School located in Munger district of Bihar
 atyant hi saral or sugam hindi main aap swami satyanand saraswati kii likhi is pustak ko padhate hue surya namaskara ke bare main alag se kaaphi kuch jaan sakate hai
 This book you www
 biharyoga
 can be obtained from net
 sau pannon kii is pustak par daam nahin likhaa he
 Surya Namaskar is composed of 12 physical positions
 lekin in sthitiyon se guzarate hue aapako apane sharir kaa dhyaan karnaa chahie
 Swami Satyananda Saraswati writes that start your consciousness from head to foot
 jis prakaar ek torch aap andhere main ghumaate hue kamare main padi alag-alag chizon ko dekhte hai
 In the same way, take your consciousness to the soles of the feet and experience the contact points of the land and the soles
 bina is sthiti ko hasil kiye surya namaskara shuru hi nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 i am writing some things from this book so that not only the controversy over Surya Namaskar can be considered
 pustak main saaf-suthri tasveeron ke zariye asana ke bare main bataaya gaya he, jise dekhte or padhate hue aap surya namaskara main dakshata hasil kar sakate hai
 It is better that you do Surya Namaskar at sunrise and do empty stomach
 din main kabhi bhi kar sakate hai, lekin pet khaali hona chahie
 Mantras have also been given with every posture of Surya Namaskar
 pranamasana, hast uttanasana, padahastasana, ashwasanchaalan, parvatasana, ashtaang namaskara, bhujangasana, parvatasana, ashwasanchaalan, padahastasana, hast uttanasana or phir pranamasana
 Beginning with pranamasana and ending with it means returning back from where we were
 ise surya namaskara kii aadhi aavriti kehete hai
 One will be counted when you do it twice
 ek aavriti ke liye 24 sthitiyaan hai
 There is a group of 12 asanas, which you have to do twice
 is tarah se aap 4 yaa 6 baar karen or phir dhire-dhire aavritiyon ko badhaate jaaen
 Swamiji writes that in the practice of Surya Namaskar all 24 asanas should be completed in one go without stopping
 is baat kaa khyaal rakhiye ki kis asana ke saath saans bheetar leni he yaa baahar chhodani he
 Do 6 asanas slowly and 6 with some speed
 surya namaskara ke abhyaas main sharir par aavashyaktaa se adhik jor na daalana ek mahatvapurn baat he
 It would have been better to have a big calendar of rugs of Surya Namaskar, which you can do while hanging it in the room
 2011 main nikhil bhandari ne dilli main terminal thri ke naam se atyaadhunik indira gandhi antarrashtriya hawaii adde par surya namaskara kii shandaar kalakriti banaai he
 Looking at these idols, you can imbibe every posture of Surya Namaskar
 agar aisi murtiyon parkon main bana di jaaen to vahaan jamaa hone vaale log sahi tareeke se surya namaskara kar sakenge
 After Surya Namaskar, you should breathe deeply for a few seconds in the original standing position, then lie down on your back in Shavasana
 is asana kii bhi apni ek prakriya or saavdhaaniyaan hai
 Every posture of Surya Namaskar has different advantages in the body 
 hast uttanasana se motopa kam hota he
 Padahastasana has massage of liver, kidney
 kabz kii beemaari dur hoti he
 Increases blood flow to the brain
 iske prabhaavon par alag se ek chapter he
 i cannot print the entire book here, but through some of its points, i am telling you that a new book opens with every seat
 tippaniyan You can balance the body, mind, rhythm, thoughts and lifestyle through Surya Namaskar
 yoga se aapako jagat kii drushti hi nahin milti balki sharir-sansar ko bhi aap jaanane lagate hai
 Starts to center its centers
 surya namaskara kiijie or sabase pehle unhen thik se karne ke liye kahie jo surya namaskara ko lekar anaap shanaap bayaan dete hai
 Any Siddha yogi can tell by his actions that the man is excited but there is no symptom of Surya Namaskar
 aap hinsak bayaan tabhi dete hai jab sharir or man kaa santulan kho dete hai
 Which is a proof in itself that a person doing this would not even know a posture of Surya Namaskar properly
 aisa karne vaale sabhi sampradaayon or dalon main hai
 Surya Namaskar is not a greeting to the rising sun, but is the art of maintaining your physical and mental routine with the speed of the sun
 ise karte hue koob anand aata he
 Yoga cannot be imposed on anyone
 use apane bheetar ke anushaasan se saadhaa jaataa he
 It is not for external publicity
 atmik sansar main vicharan karne ke liye hai
 Therefore, do yoga
 agar yoga karte hue aapke vichaar or jivan style main parivartan nahin aate hai to nishchit rup se aapane galat guru chunaa he yaa aapane sahi tareeke se yoga nahin kiya he
 Many people wake up at five in the morning and do yoga in the wrong way in the park, many of them get sick and many fall ill
 isliye yoga karte samay saavdhaanee or jaankaree donon kaa khyaal rakhen

 It has been published by Bihar Yog Vidya School located in Munger district of Bihar
 atyant hi saral or sugam hindi main aap swami satyanand saraswati kii likhi is pustak ko padhate hue surya namaskara ke bare main alag se kaaphi kuch jaan sakate hai
 This book you www
 biharyoga
 can be obtained from net
 sau pannon kii is pustak par daam nahin likhaa he
 Surya Namaskar is composed of 12 physical positions
 lekin in sthitiyon se guzarate hue aapako apane sharir kaa dhyaan karnaa chahie
 Swami Satyananda Saraswati writes that start your consciousness from head to foot
 jis prakaar ek torch aap andhere main ghumaate hue kamare main padi alag-alag chizon ko dekhte hai
 In the same way, take your consciousness to the soles of the feet and experience the contact points of the land and the soles
 bina is sthiti ko hasil kiye surya namaskara shuru hi nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 i am writing some things from this book so that not only the controversy over Surya Namaskar can be considered
 pustak main saaf-suthri tasveeron ke zariye asana ke bare main bataaya gaya he, jise dekhte or padhate hue aap surya namaskara main dakshata hasil kar sakate hai
 It is better that you do Surya Namaskar at sunrise and do empty stomach
 din main kabhi bhi kar sakate hai, lekin pet khaali hona chahie
 Mantras have also been given with every posture of Surya Namaskar
 pranamasana, hast uttanasana, padahastasana, ashwasanchaalan, parvatasana, ashtaang namaskara, bhujangasana, parvatasana, ashwasanchaalan, padahastasana, hast uttanasana or phir pranamasana
 Beginning with pranamasana and ending with it means returning back from where we were
 ise surya namaskara kii aadhi aavriti kehete hai
 One will be counted when you do it twice
 ek aavriti ke liye 24 sthitiyaan hai
 There is a group of 12 asanas, which you have to do twice
 is tarah se aap 4 yaa 6 baar karen or phir dhire-dhire aavritiyon ko badhaate jaaen
 Swamiji writes that in the practice of Surya Namaskar all 24 asanas should be completed in one go without stopping
 is baat kaa khyaal rakhiye ki kis asana ke saath saans bheetar leni he yaa baahar chhodani he
 Do 6 asanas slowly and 6 with some speed
 surya namaskara ke abhyaas main sharir par aavashyaktaa se adhik jor na daalana ek mahatvapurn baat he
 It would have been better to have a big calendar of rugs of Surya Namaskar, which you can do while hanging it in the room
 2011 main nikhil bhandari ne dilli main terminal thri ke naam se atyaadhunik indira gandhi antarrashtriya hawaii adde par surya namaskara kii shandaar kalakriti banaai he
 Looking at these idols, you can imbibe every posture of Surya Namaskar
 agar aisi murtiyon parkon main bana di jaaen to vahaan jamaa hone vaale log sahi tareeke se surya namaskara kar sakenge
 After Surya Namaskar, you should breathe deeply for a few seconds in the original standing position, then lie down on your back in Shavasana
 is asana kii bhi apni ek prakriya or saavdhaaniyaan hai
 Every posture of Surya Namaskar has different benefits for the body
 hast uttanasana se motopa kam hota he
 Padahastasana has massage of liver, kidney
 kabz kii beemaari dur hoti he
 Increases blood flow to the brain
 iske prabhaavon par alag se ek chapter he
 i cannot print the entire book here, but through some of its points, i am telling you that a new book opens with every seat
 tippaniyan You can balance the body, mind, rhythm, thoughts and lifestyle through Surya Namaskar
 yoga se aapako jagat kii drushti hi nahin milti balki sharir-sansar ko bhi aap jaanane lagate hai
 Starts to center its centers
 surya namaskara kiijie or sabase pehle unhen thik se karne ke liye kahie jo surya namaskara ko lekar anaap shanaap bayaan dete hai
 Any Siddha yogi can tell by his actions that the man is excited but there is no symptom of Surya Namaskar
 aap hinsak bayaan tabhi dete hai jab sharir or man kaa santulan kho dete hai
 Which is a proof in itself that a person doing this would not even know a posture of Surya Namaskar properly
 aisa karne vaale sabhi sampradaayon or dalon main hai
 Surya Namaskar is not a greeting to the rising sun, but is the art of maintaining your physical and mental routine with the speed of the sun
 ise karte hue koob anand aata he
 Yoga cannot be imposed on anyone
 use apane bheetar ke anushaasan se saadhaa jaataa he
 It is not for external publicity
 atmik sansar main vicharan karne ke liye hai
 Therefore, do yoga
 agar yoga karte hue aapke vichaar or jivan style main parivartan nahin aate hai to nishchit rup se aapane galat guru chunaa he yaa aapane sahi tareeke se yoga nahin kiya he
 Many people wake up at five in the morning and do yoga in the wrong way in the park, many of them get sick and many fall ill
 isliye yoga karte samay saavdhaanee or jaankaree donon kaa khyaal rakhen

 Pranamasana, Hasta Uttanasana, Padahastasana, Ashvasanchalana, Parvatasana, Ashtanga Namaskar, Bhujangasana, Parvatasana, Ashvasanchalana, Padahastasana, Hasta Uttanasana and then Pranamasana
 pranamasana se aarambh or usee par ant yani jahaan se chale the vahiin laut kar aana he
 This is called half frequency of Surya Namaskar
 jab aap ise do baar karenge to ek gina jayega
 There are 24 conditions for a frequency
 12 asana kaa ek samooh hota he, jise aapako do baar karnaa he
 In this way, you do it 4 or 6 times and then gradually increase the frequencies
 swami ji likhte hai ki surya namaskara ke abhyaas main sabhi 24 asana ko bina ruke ek hi baar main puraa karnaa chahie
 Take care with which posture to breathe in or out
 6 asana dhire-dhire karen or 6 ko kuch tej gati se
 In the practice of Surya Namaskar it is an important thing not to put excessive force on the body
 behatar hota ki surya namaskara ke asana kaa ek bada-sa calendar hota, jise aap kamare main taang kar dekhte hue kar saken
 In 2011 Nikhil Bhandari has created a stunning artwork of Surya Namaskar at the state-of-the-art Indira Gandhi International Airport called Terminal Three in Delhi
 in murtiyon ko dekhte hue aap surya namaskara ke har asana ko aatmsaat kar sakate hai
 If such idols are made in the parks, then people who gather there will be able to salute the sun in the right way
 surya namaskara ke baad khadey-khadey mul sthiti main hi kuch second tak gaharaai se saans leni chahie phir savasana main peeth ke bal let janaa chahie
 This asana also has its own procedures and precautions
 surya namaskara ke har asana kaa sharir ke alag phaayde hai
 Obesity is reduced due to manual elimination
 padahastasana se liver, gurda kii maalish ho ti he
 Constipation is cured
 mastishk main rakt pravaah badhata he
 There is a separate chapter on its effects
 main yahaan puri kitaab nahin chhap saktaa lekin iske kuch binduon ke zariye bataa rahaa hum ki har asana ke saath ek nai kitaab khul jaati he
 The comments sharir, man, lay, vichaar or jivan style in sabamein aap surya namaskara ke zariye santulan kaayam kar sakate hai
 With yoga you not only get the vision of the world, but you also get to know the body-world
 uske kendron ko saadhane lagate hai
 Do Surya Namaskar and first of all ask them to do it properly, which makes a silent statement about Surya Namaskar
 unki aisi harkaton se koi bhi siddh yogi bataa saktaa he ki banda utsahit to he magar surya namaskara kaa koi lakshan nazar nahin aata
 You make violent statements only when you lose the balance of body and mind
 jo apane aap main pramaan he ki aisa karne vaala vyakti surya namaskara kaa ek asana bhi thik se nahin jaanata hoga
 All such sects and parties are there
 surya namaskara chadhate suraj ko namaskara nahin he, balki suraj kii gati ke saath apni shaareerik or maansik dincharya ko saadhane kii kala he
 i enjoy doing it
 yoga kisi par thopa nahin ja saktaa
 He is guided by his inner discipline
 yah bahari prachaar ke liye nahin he
 To roam the spiritual world
 isliye yoga zarur kiijie

 kai log rose subah paanch baje uthakar park main galat salat tareeke se yoga karte rahete hai, unamem se kaiyon kii beemaari bad jaati he or kai biimaar pad jate hai

 ayodhya maamle main somvaar ko supreme court main 38wein din kii sunwaayee ke dauraan muslim pakshakaron ke vakil rajeev dhawan ne court se kaha ki dilachasp baat yah he ki is cese kii sunwaayee ke dauraan sabhi sawaal hamase hi kiye jate hai
 The Hindu side is never questioned
 dhawan ke is bayaan par hindu pakshakaron ne aapatti jataai
 Along with this, Rajiv Dhawan said that after changing the structure on 6 December 1992, we changed our demand and our demand is that we should be handed over the mosque in the same structure as on 5 December 1992
 dhawan ne cese kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki mujhe jawaab dene ke liye time nahin diya gaya he, jo samay seemaa tay kii gai he wo kaaphi nahin he
 In this case, many facts and legal aspects have to be put before the court
 rajeev dhawan or hindu pakshakaron ke vakil sies vaidyanathan donon ne likhit daleelein court ko deen
 Dhawan said that no evidence was given that Rama was born below the central dome
 gumbad ke neeche ram janm hone, shraddhaluon ke vahiin phool prasad chadhaane kaa koi bhi daawa siddh nahin kiya gaya
 People were entombed under the dome by trespassing
 jab vahaan puja chal rahi thi to andar ghusane kaa matlab kya he? iskaa matlab puja baahar hi ho rahi thi
 Never built a mosque by breaking the temple
 vahaan lagaataar namaaz hoti rahi thi
 Dhawan said that custom is not a mind game
 ise vishwaas ke saath nahin milaayaa ja saktaa
 The Hindu side presented all the arguments without any factual basis and explanation
 1989 tak hinduon dwaara jameen par malikana haq kaa daawa nahin kiya
 Dhawan said that between 1885 and 1989 the title of the land was never claimed by the Hindu side
 jabaki, 1854 se hi babari masjid ke rakrakhaav ke liye british sarkaar dwaara anudaan die jate rahe
 Dhawan considered that archaeological evidence can be substantiated
 haalanki, isse pehle puraatatv ko muslim pakshakaron ne ek saamaajik vigyaan ke rup main mana tha or use khaarij kar diya tha
 Dhawan said that the ASI report never said that the temple was demolished and converted into a mosque
 is jagah par hameshaa muslimon kaa kabja rahaa
 The Hindus claimed the title of the land much later but it was rejected
 unhone 1934 se pratikul kabje kaa daawa kiya jiske liye koi saboot nahin he
 He also said that there is no evidence to show that the Wadi (hindu) owns the disputed land
 hinduon ko sirf bhoomi ke upyog kaa adhikaar tha
 Apart from this, no rights were given to Hindus
 unhen purvi daravaaje se pravesh karne or prarthana karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya, isse zyada kuch nahin
 Justice SA Bobde and Justice DY Chandrachud asked whether the claim of Muslims as the sole authority would not lighten their argument? While the Hindus had the right to enter the outer courtyard
 dhawan ne kaha ki isse unhen adhikaar to nahin miltaa
 Justice DY Chandrachud said that there are several documents which show that he lived in the outer courtyard
 dhawan ne kaha ki yah dikhaane ke liye unke paas koi saboot nahin he ki hindu babari masjid kii vivaadit bhoomi kaa maalik he
 There is not a single document which proves that the Hindus had previously occupied there
 justise DY chandrachud ne rajeev dhawan se hinduon ke bahari ahaate par kabze ke bare main poocha
 Justice DY Chandrachud stated that documents dating back to 1858 show that Ram Chabutara was established, he had the authority
 iske alaava dhawan ne kaha ki hindu paksh ke paas koi malikana haq kaa dastauez nahin he or naa hi tha
 It is the property of Waqf since the time of the British and the Hindus forcibly took illegal possession here
 hinduon ko puja kaa or sevadaar hone kaa adhikaar diya gaya jabaki unke paas malikana haq nahin tha
 By 1885–86, the British opened the Babri complex to the eastern gate for Hindus to pray
 iskaa matlab saarvajanik vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liye tha or isse adhik kuch nahin tha
 Faith, travelogue, Skanda Purana cannot give them the right to own land
 musalamaanon kaa kabza kabhi andeh main nahin tha
 The only thing that needs to be decided is about them
 unhone prarthana karne kii anumati maangi or ab unhone tital par apana daawa kiya

 kal se alag-alag sutron ke hawaale se khabar aa rahi thi ki bas amarnath shrin board se register nahin he, varna use suraksha kafile ke saath dopaher baarah baje hi jawahar tunnel paar kara diya jaataa
 Salim says that the registration of the bus was done or else how would a passenger visit
 2 july ko hi darshan ho chukaa tha or yatri paryaton kar rahe the
 Our colleague Nazir has written in his report that the bus crossed six security points but was not stopped
 yah kaise ho saktaa he, khaskar tab jab vahaan kisi bhi minute aatankwaadi hamale kii ashanka thi
 Salim also told that there were some more buses with him but when the tire of his bus was punctured, the buses went ahead
 panchar thik hone ke baad saleem apni bas lekar aage niklaa to hamalaa ho gaya
 Two-three security personnel were seen at some places on the way, but the number was less, so the bus did not stop
 kahin bayaan he ki andhera itnaa tha ki kuch dikh nahin rahaa tha, kahin bayaan he ki do teen suraksha karmchaaree dikhe to bas nahin rukii
 Therefore, it seems that despite Salim's statement, how this lapse occurred, should not be considered as an official and final answer
 is sawaal kaa jawaab aana baaki he ki bas kiske kehane se der shaam srinagar se ravaanaa hui
 Did the passengers insist, did the passengers not know that the risk was at work
 rajeev ranjan kaa kahana he ki jammu kashmir kii police maanati he ki shaam saat baje ke baad haive par bas nahin ja sakati thi
 There is no rule, then how did the bus go and when did it stop, why did no one stop the bus
 bhale hi ram madhav chook ko paribhaashit karte rahen lekin up mukhyamantri bhi maanate hai ki suraksha main chook hui he or isaki jaanch honi chahie
 Nirmala Thakur from Dahanu in Maharashtra was also among the passengers
 unki maut ho gai
 His daughter Neetu Singh has accused the travel organizer of negligence
 is ghatana kaa desh bhar main sabhi samudaayon ne milakar virodh kiya he, lekin soshal media par kai log is ghatana ke bahaane sanprayadik unmaad failaane kaa jo prayaas hua he, uskaa bhi alag se adhyayan karnaa chahie
 Under the guise of anger and reaction to the incident, the responsible people were not questioning the security, were not questioning the failure of Kashmir's policies, were questioning those who had nothing to do with the incident and Who have been condemning the violent incidents of the past
 isi kii chapet main aakar ek mahila ne grahamantri rajnath singh ke twitor par abhadra bhashaa main unase kah diya ki kashmiriat kii parvaah kise he
 Your job is not appeasement
 un kaayron ko khinch kar bhun dijie
 So the Home Minister replied to this by not keeping silence nor turning around
 unhone kaha, miss kalra, ye meraa kaam he ki main desh ke har hisse main shanti or sadbhaav banaaun, sabhi kashmiri aatankwaadi nahin hote hai
 This answer by Rajnath Singh in the public space is a shining example
 unhone rajinati kii parvaah na karte hue apni sanvaidhanik zimmedaari saaf shabdon main bataa di ki grahamantri kaa kaam he sabaki chintaa karnaa or sabaki suraksha karnaa
 He also said that not all Kashmiris are terrorists
 miss kalra bhi rajnath singh kii shaleenta ke aage sharmasaar ho gayi or unhone apana twit dilit kar liya
 For this, Miss Kalra should also be praised that she understood the words of the Home Minister
 umr abdulla bhi rajnath ke is jawaab ke kaayal ho gaye or likhaa ki shandaar rajnath ji, aapane mujhe mureed bana liya, main aapako salaam karata hum

 In a way, these people were not just targeting Not in My Name, but were expecting them to come on the streets and perform

 Kashmir policy, challenges there, failure was not being questioned, there was no question of security lapses, there was no question of anyone's accountability, there was no talk of resignation, it was being talked about Not in my name

 In Kashmir, this incident has been opposed by leaders of every level there

 At the Gate of Jamia Millia University in Delhi, the teachers also expressed their condolences by lighting a candle and the not in my name people again gathered at Jantar Mantar
 ghatana ke dasven minute se hi log likhane lage ki kahaan hai note in maai nem vaale
 Will they perform now when the Hindu brothers are dead? wo yah bhul gaye ki note in maai nem kii takhti lekar log bheed kii hinsa ke khilaaf utre the
 BJP leader and national spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao also joined
 jiviel ko rajnath singh kaa twit sambhaal kar rakh lenaa chahie
 He tweeted whether the Not in My Name gang is protesting on the Amarnath murder or whether these protests are only for Akhlaqans, Junaidas and Khyak Khans and not for the devotees of Lord Shiva
 jiviel ke is twit kaa kya matlab he
 Immediately after the incident, the site of condemnation was condemned
 koi iske liye buddhijiviyon ko zimmedaar tehraane laga to koi haal hi main bheed kii hinsa ke kilaaf hue note in maai nem pradarshnon ko target karne laga
 Not in my name began to be questioned whether they would now perform against the Hindu pilgrims of Amarnath
 aise logon ke saamne ek samasya thi agar wo khud pradarshan karne utarate to unhen apane pasand kii sarkaar ke khilaaf narebaazi kerani padati, lihaaza wo unhen target karne lage jo pradarshan karne lage
 In a way, these people were not just targeting Not in My Name, but were expecting them to come on the streets and perform
 jis tarah se is campan ko target kiya gaya he lagata he ki ab koi virodh tab tak virodh nahin mana jayega jab tak note in maai nem kii takhti lekar pradarshan nahin hoga
 This is his great success
 is khel main chaalaaki ho rahi thi
 Kashmir policy, challenges there, failure was not being questioned, there was no question of security lapses, there was no question of anyone's accountability, there was no talk of resignation, it was being talked about Not in my name
 yah behad chaalaak tarika he zimmedaari ke sawaal ko kahin or shift kar dena
 Where were you, then speak then speak now
 kisi ko yah poochna chahie tha ki jab jammu kashmir ke pulicekarmiyon kii maut hoti he to unke liye koun nikalataa he, kya wo log pradarshan karne gaye the jo note in maai nem waalon ko khoj rahe hai
 This tu tu main me has no meaning
 vaise mangalvaar dopaher khabar aane lagi ki note in maai nem ke aayojakon ne nagarikon se apil kii he ki ve jantar mantar par aaen
 Hridayesh Joshi was at Jantar Mantar
 vahaan jamaa hue logon main kashmir ke bhi the or patrakarita ke mahapurush ganesh shankar vidhyaarthee ke gaanv se bhi koi aa gaya tha
 The way this campaign has been targeted, it seems that no protest will be considered as a protest until there will be a demonstration with the plank of Not in My Name
 yah unki badi kamyaabi he
 This game was being manipulated
 kashmir kii niti, vahaan kii chunautiyaan, naakaami par sawaal nahin ho rahe the, suraksha main chook ko lekar sawaal nahin ho rahaa tha, kisi kii javabdehi ko lekar sawaal nahin ho rahaa tha, istife kii baat nahin ho rahi thi, baat ho rahi thi note in maai nem waalon kii
 This is a very clever way to shift the question of responsibility elsewhere
 tum kahaan the, tab bole to ab bolo
 One should have asked who came out for the Jammu and Kashmir policemen when they died, did they go to protest who are searching for those not in my name
 is tu tu main main kaa koi matlab nahin he
 However, on Tuesday afternoon news started coming that the organizers of Not in My Name have appealed to the citizens to come to Jantar Mantar

 com / 6C01TU2NBL lagata he ki nasa kaa rover curiosity mangal grah par kachra failaa rahaa he
 a luminous object appears on Mars in a photo sent from the rover to Earth, and upon closer look, it appears to be a plastic wrapper that must have dropped out of the robot
 curiosity pataa karegaa ‘kya ham akele hai’sutron ke mutabik, is khoj ne rover ke mangal abhiyaan main ek nayaa mode laa diya he
 The goal of the rover is to take soil from the soil of Mars and conduct chemical and biological testing of it
 haalanki magal par kuch or bhi agyaat chamakdaar chijen dikh rahi hai
 It is believed at first sight that she would have fallen from the curiosity
 lekin vah mangal par milane vaali vastu bhi ho sakati he
 What is the secret yet? Curiosity is in the process of putting the soil of Mars in its chemistry and mineralogy equipment (chemin)
 is upkaran main mitti ke bich se eks kirnon kii beam bhej kar uski banaavat or usamen maujuud tatwon ke bare main janaa jayega
 In the process of testing the voice recording and photomangal soil samples sent by Mars to Curiosity Rover, the Rover has to dig the soil from the Red Planet, filter it again and then put it into an instrument for analysis
 is dauraan is baat kaa puraa dhyaan rakhana he ki usamen prithvi se gai mitti kaa ek bhi kan shaamil naa ho
 The rover immediately stopped the process to investigate this unknown object found after lifting the soil for the first time and got involved in the investigation
 uske baad usne 12 aktubar ko doosraa namoona liya
 Luminous particles are also found in the pit that Curiosity has dug on Mars
 pehle vaigyanikon ko laga ki rover apane hi malbe main khudaai karne laga he
 But later investigation revealed that some of the particles are from Mars Earth itself
 mars rover: vigyaan kaa 'mangal'may yuganasa philhal curiosity kii madad se usee sthaan se mitti kaa teesraa namoona lene kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 This will help scientists to know whether those luminous particles are part of a waste or whether they are really valuable particles worth investigating

 team india ke purv captain rahul dravid ne mangalvaar ko bisisiai se bharat main junior cricket ke liye khaakaa taiyaar karne kii apil kii
 He said that for the development of Indian cricket, it is very important to get rid of cheating and illegal bowling action at the junior level
 dravid ne kahaaki umr main dhokhadhadi or galat gendbaaji ection ko sahi karne main prashikshakon kii naakaami kaa bhartiya cricket par bahut bura asar pad rahaa he
 He said in the fourth MAK Pataudi Memorial Lecture, "the time has come when corrective measures should be taken to deal with these issues
" meraa maananaa he ki umr main dhokhadhadi kaa yah vyavsaay khatarnaak he or yahaan tak ki jehar ke samaan he
 "how different cheating and fixing", famous as' Wall of Cricket ', Dravid further said,' i have a question that if a child sees his parents and trainers cheating and making fake birth certificates Would that not encourage him to become a cheater? His elder is teaching him to lie
 chaudaa saal kii umr main yah dhokhadhadi ho sakati he, lekin 25 saal kii umr main yah phixing or bhrashtachar ho saktaa he
 How can these two differ
 donon maamalon main kya yah spasht dhokhaa nahin he?'prashikshakon par uthaae sawalpurv bhartiya captain negendbaaji actionko lekar bhi junior str par se gambhir kadam uthaane kii vakaalat kii
 Dravid said, "I was very disappointed when i heard that the under-19 bowler has been reported for suspected bowling action
" uske us umr tak pahunchane tak coach kya kar rahe the
 Did his wrong action start at the age of ten
 kya uske aage ke prashikshakon ne ise nazarandaaj kiya kyonki vah wicket le rahaa tha or match jeet rahaa tha
 The former captain spoke on a number of issues related to the junior level and said that after being appointed as the coach of the under-19 cricket team, he had a direct experience of junior cricket
 is kaarykram main bharat or dakshin africa kii cricket tiimon ne bhi hissaa liya jo yahaan firozshah kotla main chauthaa test match khelengi
 Pataudi's wife Sharmila Tagore was also present at the event
 'pratibhashali khilaadi baahar rah jate hai'dravid ne sandigdh gendbaaji ection ke bare main kaha, 'gendbaaji ection kii tarah alp avadhi ke parinaamon par jor dene ke kaaran junior str ke maichon main adhik umr ke khilaadi khelte hai
 This whole process begins when a coach changes the player's date of birth and allows him to play in the local tournament
 mata-pita bachche kii umr main ek yaa do saal kam hone se khush hote hai
 He further added, "the truth is that a player who cheats at his age does not necessarily make it to the junior level because he is better but because he is physically strong and big
 iskaa gaharaa prabhaav padegaa, kyonki ek eemaandaar or pratibhashali khilaadi ko team se baahar hona padataa he or use hameshaa ke liye khone kaa jokhim paidaa ho jaataa he
 "the success of Sachin is extraordinary" Dravid said that most children do not get the support system that Sachin Tendulkar had in his early days
 unhone kaha, 'sachin alag tarah kaa tha
 He was unique in terms of talent
 bhartiya team main uske udai, uski safalataa saadhaaran se puri tarah pare thi
 It was unprecedented and it was surprising for those of us his age
 ''har kisi ko sachin jaisi suvidha nahin'rahul dravid ne aage kaha, 'log yah bhul gaye ki sachin ke saath ek shandaar sahyogi pranali thi
 His family was supportive and cared for him
 unka bada bhai hameshaa unke saath maargdarshan karne ke liye rahata tha
 His coach Ramakant Achrekar was more than a coach in his life and mentor on the pitch
 unhone use sikhaaya ki balla kaise pakadana he or aage kaise badhanaa he
 Sachin was fortunate to have such support
 'dravid ne cricket academy main bacchon ke liye sakht dishanirdesh taiyaar karne ke liye bhi kaha
 He said, 'BCCI should prepare minimum standard guidelines which academies will have to follow
 yadi ve asafal rahati hai to unki khinchaai honi chahie

 Namvar Singh rightly said that "this is the first issue of any magazine to be extracted from me by focusing on Mirambai and so rich

 This issue of the narrative does the work of completing it and with this self-realization that talking on Meera means talking on a phenomenon

 com / kdsitvbztp— COLORS (@colorstv)december 28, 2018 In the US presidential election, Republican candidate Donald Trump is making every effort to reach the Indian American community
 isi koshish main unki bahu ne varjeenia main ek hindu mandir main diwali manaai
 Virginia is an important state where none of the Democratic and Republican candidates see a large majority
 trump ke bete erik trump kii patni lara trump ne kaha ki aath november ko hone vaale aam chunaavon main agar unke sasur ko america kaa raashtrapati chunaa jaataa he to bharat or america ke sambandh ek nai oonchai par pahunchenge
 Lara said that Donald Trump has a lot of love and affection for India and its people
 bhartiya samskruti kaa sammaan karte hue unhone varjeenia ke rajdhani mandir main pravesh se pehle baahar apane juute utaare
 He said, 'I really like Hindu culture and i respect it
 ’ mandir parisar main trump ke parivaar ke sadasyon kaa swaagat karte hue bhartiya america samudaay ke kaaryakarta rajesh guti ne kaha ki unki maujuudagi se rajya kii ferefaques evam lauden county main diwali jald aa gai he
 Gooty, who was instrumental in inviting Lara to the Hindu temple to celebrate Diwali, said, "it has energized the local indian-american community
 ham vibhinn dharmon ke bich ke, vividhtaon ke samarohon main shaamil hone main nai urja ke saath bhaag lenaa or sahaayta dena jari rakhenge
 'initially Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump was supposed to come to the temple, but Trump's campaign campaign asked her to move to another location in view of the rapidly changing scenario of the election
 is mandir kaa udghaatan saal 2000 main kiya gaya tha
 It is the oldest temple in Loudon County
 lauden county main bhartiya america samudaay ne pichley ek dashak main sabase teji se vikaas kiya he
 This is the first time that a member of the family of one of the top two presidential candidates has visited a Hindu temple

 5 Star Artist: Emraan Hashmi, Humaima Malik, KK Menon, Paresh rawaldirector: Kunal Deshmukh says, everything has a phase
 lagata he, imran hashmi ke maamle main bhi aisa hi he
 They are seen losing their charm, or they are not in their rhythm
 unki pichhali do filmein 'ghanchakkar' or 'ek thi dian' box offis par dhadaam ho chuki hai
 Now he has brought King Natwarlal
 film dekhakar yah baat sabit ho chuki he ki sirf kising ke dam par film hit nahin ho sakati kyonki unki apni hi bahan aalia bhatta serial kisar kaa tamgaa paa chuki hai or sabhi nae hero is kaam main maahir ho chuke hai
 In such a situation, something new was expected from Emraan Hashmi and he should have done so as competition has increased
 lekin kamjor kahani or kunal deshmukh kaa dhilaa diarection film ko lekar imran hashmi ke liye zyada ummiden nahin jagaata he
 There is so much thug (emraan Hashmi) in the story, who along with his friend, works to defraud people
 uske oonche khwab he
 His friend gets murdered
 phir use pataa chalata he ki uske dost kaa katl kisne kiya he
 He prepares to take revenge on her and his girlfriend (humaima Malik) helps in this
 kahani thagi, dosti, badale or prem kii he
 There is nothing new in the story
 puri tarah film imran hashmi ke andaaj or chuumane kii kala ke saath hi paresh rawal kii timming par tiki he
 But the film disappoints due to the weak story and sluggish treatment
 star apilimran is tarah kii kahani ke saath, jitna best kar sakate the unhone kiya
 Kunal Deshmukh is known for making a tit film but this time he seems a bit missed
 imran kising, romance or acting main best hai
 Paresh Rawal is the fun factor of the film
 unke aate hi film main jaan aa jaati he
 Whatever responsibility (romance and kissing) has been assigned to Humaima, he has worked shoulder to shoulder with Emraan Hashmi
 ve bahut impressive nahin hai
 KK Menon and Deepak Tijori are also fine
 kamai kii batimran hashmi kii filmein kam bajet kii hoti hai or kuch samay pehle tak unhen safalataa kii guarantee mana jaataa tha
 Now the scene is changing
 unhen ek adad hit kii sakht darkaar he
 An attempt has been made to make 'raja Natwarlal' a masala film
 aisa ho nahin paaya he
 Emraan Hashmi has a good fan following at single screen theaters
 unhone apane phans ke liye vah kaam jamkar kiya he jisaki vajah se unhen serial kisar kaa tag mila he
 But the songs of the film are mediocre which does not happen in his films
 unki kising par to sitiyaan bajati hai, lekin film khatm hone ke baad baahar aate darshakon main zyada josh najar nahin aata
 In such a situation, there is hardly any hope of doing any big miracle in terms of earnings at the box office
 kisi rashtriya pariksha main ek prashn poocha jaae ki nimnaankit shreniyon main se kinhin teen ke aage tik karen or bataayen ki lalit modi kya hai
 Like i made a long question paper so that you can tick
 1
 Are fugitives, 2
 bhagoda nahin hai, 3
 Global tourists are, 4
 sachche deshbhakt hai, 5
 Family friends are 6
 jinke mitra hai unke bhi dushman hai, 7
 Those who have enemies also have friends, 8
 sabko fansaate hai, sab inako bachaate hai, 9
 If there is a Modi government in the country, 10
 lalit kii bhi ek modi sarkaar he
 It was two or three years ago
 kaamanwealth ghotaalaa, spectrum ghotaalaa or koyala ghotaalaa ko lekar channelon ke prime time par ratjaga hua karata tha
 There used to be debate, not weeks and months
 ghadi-ghadi sansad band hoti thi or prime time ke hisaab se pravaktaaon kii shaam badalane lagi
 They also went live from outside the wedding and birthday day party
 dhire-dhire desh kii raajnneetik fizaa badalane lagi
 Nobody then said whether there was another issue in the country
 rose kuch na kuch jaankaree saamne aa ja rahi he
 Lalit Modi is making it difficult for many people to come in front of the media without coming forward
 indian express ne ravivaar ko ek puraa panna lalit modi ko samarpit karte hue sheershak diya- modi sarkaar
 Lalit Modi's blossoming face is welcoming the readers to come, read as much as i can about you
 main sarkaron kaa bhi sarkaar hum
 It is no less surprising that one Modi government will face another Modi government, which will challenge the elder Modi government's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley that he will also expose them
 ye dil se congressi hai
 What would it be like to see the politics in which the public invests its power in such a tumultuous state
 isliye lalit modi kii khabar tivi ke baichaiyn hote darshakon kaa bhi imtahaan he ki ve kab tak kuch nahin hote hue is shaks kaa bahut kuch hona sweekaar karte rahenge
 At the behest of someone or say it yourself
 ke
 Singh is difficult to say but former Home Secretary and BJP MP R
K
 ke
 Only another tweet of Lalit Modi can save BJP from Singh's statement

 The report of our colleague Srinivasan Jain has revealed that India has not taken any notice against Lalit Modi in Interpol
 maujuuda vivaad kii shuruuaat main jab lalit modi ke vakil ne kaha tha ki koi notice nahin he tab vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki lite blue corner notice jari hua he, lekin interpol ke purv pramukh nobel ne shrinivasana jain ko bataaya ki bharat ne koi lite blue corner notice kii maang nahin kii he
 So did the finance minister say wrong nobel ne likhaa he ki ve lalit modi ko 2013 se jaanate hai or bharat ne kabhi unke kilaaf saboot nahin diye hai
 In this picture is Ron Noble with Lalit Modi who was the Chief of Interpol till November last year
 oktober 2014 kii is tasviir main lalit modi or nobel ek saath footbal match dekhte hue paye ja sakate hai
 Both are enjoying the La Clasico match between Barcelona and Rial Madrid
 lalit modi nobel ko apana bhai bataate hai
 Srinivasan Jain says that the manner in which Lalit Modi goes on telling the cases against him to everyone, it cannot happen that Nobel does not know anything about him
 to kya upie or endie donon hi sarkaron main lalit modi kii hi sarkaar chal rahi he
 Jaitley, who spoke about the business relationship between Vasundhara Raje's son and Lalit Modi, said on Tuesday that no clean chit has been given while Nitin Gadkari is running clean chit
 sarkaar ko ek clin chit ayog bana lenaa chahie
 Meanwhile, another case has come up of Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria
 lagata he lalit modi har milane vaale kaa photo khinch lete hai
 Rakesh Maria has accepted from the Maharashtra government that he met Modi in London on 17 July 2014
 isi maheene ke aas paas sushamaa ne lalit modi kii madad kii thi
 Maria has told that there was a meeting regarding Modi's security and had told the Home Minister of the Congress NCP government about it

 Lalit is engaged in shouting and the government is there to glide his words

 It was two or three years ago
 kaamanwealth ghotaalaa, spectrum ghotaalaa or koyala ghotaalaa ko lekar channelon ke prime time par ratjaga hua karata tha
 There used to be debate, not weeks and months
 ghadi-ghadi sansad band hoti thi or prime time ke hisaab se pravaktaaon kii shaam badalane lagi
 They also went live from outside the wedding and birthday day party
 dhire-dhire desh kii raajnneetik fizaa badalane lagi
 Nobody then said whether there was another issue in the country
 rose kuch na kuch jaankaree saamne aa ja rahi he
 Lalit Modi is making it difficult for many people to come in front of the media without coming forward
 indian express ne ravivaar ko ek puraa panna lalit modi ko samarpit karte hue sheershak diya- modi sarkaar
 Lalit Modi's blossoming face is welcoming the readers to come, read as much as i can about you
 main sarkaron kaa bhi sarkaar hum
 It is no less surprising that one Modi government will face another Modi government, which will challenge the elder Modi government's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley that he will also expose them
 ye dil se congressi hai
 What would it be like to see the politics in which the public invests its power in such a tumultuous state

 Gradually the country's political structure began to change
 tab koi nahin kahata tha ki desh main doosraa mudda he yaa nahin
 Everyday some information is coming out
 lalit modi bina saamne aae kai logon kaa media ke saamne aana mushkil kiye de rahe hai
 The Indian Express on Sunday dedicated an entire page to Lalit Modi, titled- Modi Sarkar
 bagal main lalit modi kaa khilakhilaataa cheharaa pathakon kaa swaagat kar rahaa he ki aao, mere bare main jitna padhanaa he padho
 i am also a government of governments
 ye bhi kam gazab nahin ki ek modi sarkaar ke saamne ek or modi sarkaar aa jaae jo bade vaale modi sarkaar ke vitt mantri arun jetali ko chunauti dene lage ki inkaa bhi pardaafash karuunga
 He is a Congressman at heart
 janata apni takat kaa jis raajnneeti main nivesh karti he use is tarah bharbhara kar girte hue dekhnaa kaisaa lagata hoga
 Therefore, Lalit Modi's news is also a test for the restless viewers of TV, how long they will continue to accept this person's lot, if nothing happens

 Singh said that there is a warrant pending against him, summons is pending, he is not a fugitive if he does not believe it
