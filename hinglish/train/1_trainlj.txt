unke paas cricket kaa tej dimag he
 You have to rely on young blood
 ham kaaphi samay se kai anaavashyak logon ko dho rahe hai
 Former Indian captain Ajit Wadekar also says, "I agree that we cannot win all the time, but we are always seen losing
" viraat kohli yaa gautam gambhir ko test team kaa captain banaaya jaae, rohit sharma or ajinkya rahane ko test team main khilne ke liye taiyaar kiya jaae or jab bhi koi pratibhavan ladkaa miltaa he to use tatkaal bhartiya team main shaamil kar lene kii jagah gharelu cricket main us par najar rakhen taaki yah sunishchit ho sake ki vah taiyaar ho gaya he
 "put forward the best faces
 No player in the current line, except Tendulkar, has decided not to play in any of the three formats
" maujuuda test team ke das khiladinnon ko sitambar main srilanka main hone vaali world tii20 championships ke liye taiyaar 15 khiladinnon kii majboot team main bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Certainly new faces are needed and they need to be effective for one format
 1983 main vishwa cap jeetne vaali team ke captain rahe kapil dev ne kaha, ''aapako test team ke liye visheshgy khiladinnon kii jarurat he, sirf aise ladakon kii nahin jo gend or balle ke saath khel sakate hon
 "the Indian team will have to learn to live without Tendulkar and Zaheer should stay out of the shorter format
 dhoni ko test maichon main khelnaa chhod dena chahie, takneekee rup se zyada majboot vriddhimaan saaha yaa dinesh karthik ko wicket keeping kaa mauka dena chahie or yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki dhoni vanade or tii20 maichon ke liye shaareerik or maansik rup se taiyaar rahen
 With Virender Sehwag constantly getting injured, the chances of him getting the game till 2015 seem difficult
 unhen teenon formet main apni maujuudagi ke bare main purnivchaar karnaa chahie
 Yuvraj Singh is best suited for limited overs format
 test team ko eshanth sharma, umesh yadav, ashok dinda or parvinder awana jaise achche tej gendbaajon kii jarurat he
 Irfan Pathan, Praveen Kumar and Bhuvneshwar Kumar can be fielded in shorter formats
 vanade or tii20 maichon ke liye ek alag, feet team rakhana sabase acchhee baat hogi
 Similarly, different types of bowling attack are also needed for different conditions
 team india ke irdagird kii team ko bhang karenmote or zyada umr ke dancan flechar puri tarah se feet nahin dikhte, khaskar aise samay main jab ek team ko aage rahane ke liye yuva coach kii jarurat he
 Fletcher's contributions have to be weighed in terms of results
 flechar kii khaasiyat ranneeti banane kii he
 His victory in just six of the 20 Test matches during his two-year tenure clearly demonstrates his failure
 unke sahyogi fielding coach trevor penni or bowling coach jo daves bhi koi chamatkaar nahin kar paae hai
 Having fun about the bowling coach of India during the Kolkata Test, Pakistani paceman Wasim Akram said, "does India have a bowling coach?" i don't see it like that ” pragyan ojha or ravichandran aswin apane vyaktigat coach se salaah lene lage hai
 It would be pertinent to ask here why the BCCI quit considering Indian names for the post of coach
 ipiel jeetne vaali team kolkata niterides ke assistant coach or dilli kii ranjai team ke chif coach vijay dahia ne kaha, ''yah kahana galat hoga ki bhartiya coach achche nahin hai
 We have not given them full chance
 ” lalchand rajput kaa udhaaharan len, jinke netritv main bhartiya team 2007 main tii-20 world cap jiti thi
 He is in charge of the Indian a team
 kuch vajahon se unhen kabhi bhi bhartiya coach ke liye shortlist kii gai suchi main nahin rakhaa gaya
 Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and V
 ve
 s
 lakshmana jaise diggajon kii maharath kaa istemaal yuva khiladinnon ko buniyadi cricket sikhaane ke liye kiya janaa chahie
 Dravid has also hinted that he is not averse to becoming a coach, Ganguly, who created an aggressive new team India, should be used to revive the team again
 nayaa tallent chahieboard or chayankartaaon ne pichhali qatari ke liye khiladinnon kii jarurat ko nazarandaaj kiya he
 There are currently only three players of leg-spin in India — Amit Mishra whose ball gets too slow in the air, Rahul Sharma who throws a much faster ball and Piyush Chawla, who is unable to give the ball enough turn
 pehle bhartiya-e team ke daure ko khiladinnon ko uphaar kii tarah diya jaataa rahaa he, jo merit kii jagah kai maandand kii vajah se isamen jagah pate the
 Look at the fate of Unmukt Chand and Harmeet Singh
 ye donon khilaadi is saal under-19 world cap jeetne vaali team kaa hissaa rahe hai or ian chapel tathaa wasim akram ne bharat kii asal sambhaavnaaon ke rup main unki tarif kii he
 Unmukt is currently struggling to make a place in the Delhi Ranji team, while Harmeet is yet to get a break in the Mumbai XI this season
 unke haashie par chale jane kaa jokhim he jaisaa ki pehle under-19 ke duusare sitaron kaa hashr ho chukaa he
 Former Indian opener Navjot Singh Sidhu says, "if you see a future in a player for five years, then invest in it
 lekin test cricket ko paryaapt mahatv den kyonki vah mul he
 Everything derives from that
 ”chot se ubarne kii kalachot prabandhan ek or mahatvapurn pahalu he jisaki cricket prashaasak shaayad hi chintaa karte hai
 The injured players include Umesh Yadav, Varun Aaron, Munaf Patel, Praveen Kumar, Zaheer and R

 after missing for nearly two years
 srisanth ne haal main pehla match khelaa he
 In this case one can learn from the example of Australia
 virodh ke baavjood vahaan kii team main khiladinnon ko andar-baahar kiya jaataa he
 Even as the match against South Africa was to be decided to determine the number one Test ranking in November, Australia played with different bowlers in all three Tests and rested key bowlers like Ben Hilfenhaus and Peter Siddle in the decider
 Was given because they had played too much
 jab lagaataar kai tej gendbaaj chotil hone lage to australia ko yah pataa laga ki juuton main spike ke ek khaas dizin kii vajah se aisa ho rahaa he or khiladinnon ko aise juute na pahanane kii salaah di gai
 India lacks to see things in such detail
 tadak-bhadak ko alavida, buniyaad par lautenti-20 lig, ipiel se jo chakachaundh vaala paisa aayaa he usase yah baat sunishchit ho gai he ki khyaati hasil karne ke liye janareshan jed (bilkul nai peedi) lambey raste par chalanaa pasand nahin kar rahi he
 Cricket with the smallest format can be blamed for this as it has insisted young batsmen to learn the art of improvised performances, thereby blocking the way for better Test batsmen to come in the future
 punjab ne is buraai ko rokane ke liye 22 varsh se kam umr ke khiladinnon ke ipiel yaa tii-20 formet main khilne par pabandi laga di he, lekin anya rajyon ne abhi koi sabak nahin liya he
 Another aspect of strengthening the foundation is that more matches are played abroad, so that a group of players with the skills to play in a challenging environment is constantly prepared
 videshon ke aise vipareet vaataavaran akasar bharat ke liye abhishaap sabit hote hai
 After being beaten in England and beaten in Australia in 2011, the Indian team has now suffered the humiliation of losing at home
 phir bhi bisisiai chup he or logon kaa gussa shant ho jane kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 But there is no way to escape this time
 sankat se nipatane ke liye kuch taatkaalik kadam uthaane honge or agle ek saal main lagaataar prayaas bhi karnaa hoga
 Then you will be able to win

 It included many new provisions to deal with 'fake news'

 Regarding this, the tone of protest in the media world has also started

 2 / 2 — Smriti z Irani (@smritiirani) April 3, 2018 What is the government's guideline? The statement issued by the ministry provides a brief overview of how a complaint about a fake news will be investigated and to whom
 Will be done by bayaan ke mutabik, 'ab phek news ke bare main kisi tarah kii shikaayat milane par yadi vah print media kaa hua to use press council of india (PCI) or electronic media kaa hua to news broadcasters association (NBA) ko bheja jayega
 These organizations will decide whether the news is fake or not
 'yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki aisi shikaayat milane par kisi patrkaar ko zyada pareshaani na ho, shikaayat kii prakriya ko donon agenciyon ke dwaara 15 din ke bheetar nipataane kii vyavastha hogi
 Significantly, after this order of the Ministry, many kinds of questions were raised on this decision
 kai patrakaron or media samooh ne sarkaar ke is faisle kii ninda kii thi
 Congress General Secretary and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh has requested Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan to conduct an inquiry into allowing the sale of tribal land in Tikamgarh, Morena and Sheopur districts

 Singh said in his letter that similarly in Bhind district, there are complaints of corruption on a large scale in such cases and he (singh) had also complained about this earlier, but what action was taken about that till date
 Could not run digvijay singh ne kaha ki ab to bhaajapa kaaryakarta bhi aarope laga rahe hai

 The Indian team has so far played 14 Test matches starting on Boxing Day i

 26 December, of which it has won only one match and that too not in Australia but in far south Africa
 bharat ke liye boxing de maichon ke parinaam utsahjanak nahin rahe hai
 The assembly election in Karnataka has been sounded
 khaskar bijepi or congress ke liye rajya kii satta naak kii ladaai ban chuki he
 Caste, community politics is very important in the state
 rajya main pichhadon, daliton or musalamaanon kii baari jansankhya ko dekhte hue congressi mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ne soshal ejineering kii AHINDA niti pesh kii he
 It will now be seen what the BJP breaks out of this
 kya he ahindarajya main 12 may kaa chunaav hai
 For this, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has introduced his social engineering policy AHINDA
 AHINDA kannada main short form he jiskaa matlab he dalit, alpsankhyak or pichhadi jati
 Significantly, Siddaramaiah had also conducted a caste census in the year 2015 with an expenditure of about 150 crores
 lekin uski report ko saarvajanik nahin kiya gaya
 However, it has leaked
 iske mutabik rajya main savarna lingayat samudaay kaa hissaa 16-17 fisadi se ghatakar mahaj 9
 8 percent is left
 isi tarah vokkalinga samudaay kaa hissaa 14-15 fisadi se ghatakar kareeb 8 fisadi hi rah gaya he
 6 of the state according to the census
 5 karod jansankhya main sabase zyada 24 fisadi hissaa daliton kaa he
 Muslims share in the state 12
 5 fisadi he
 Scheduled tribes and Kurubas (the community from which Chief Minister Siddaramaiah comes) constitute 7-7 per cent of the population
 brahmanon kii jansankhya mahaj 2 fisadi hi he
 Thus, AHINDA constitutes about 80% of the total population of Karnataka
 is li data ne rajya kii sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko apni ranneeti badalane par majaboor kar diya he
 BJP is trying its best to convince Lingayat and Vokkalinga
 dalit voton ko lubhaane ke liye jedy es ne karnataka main mayawati kii bispi se gathjod kiya he
 The Center for Studies of Developing Studies (CSDS) has done a socio-caste analysis of votes cast in Karnataka in the 2008 elections
 is adhyayan ke mutabik pichley chunaav main karnataka main ucch saamaajik prishthbhumi ke vot teenon pramukh dalon main lagbhag baraabar bante the
 The Congress got 34 per cent of this category, BJP 33 per cent and JD (S) 31 per cent
 savarnon ke sabase zyada vot bijepi kohalanki jati ke hisaab se dekhen to voton main kaaphi antar he
 According to the study, 51 percent of the votes of Sarvana Lingayat were received by the BJP led by BS Yeddyurappa
 yediurppa khud lingayat samudaay se aate hai
 The Congress got only 25 per cent of the Lingayat community and 15 per cent for the Janata dal-s
 jati ke hisaab se dekhen to savarno ke sabase zyada 41 fisadi vot bijepi ko, 33 fisadi congress ko or 13 fisadi jedy (es) ko mili the
 The JD (S), led by HD Deve Gowda, received 40 per cent of the votes of the Vokkalinga community
 congress ko is samudaay ke 35 fisadi, jabaki bijepi ko sirf 18 fisadi vot mili the
 Congress got the maximum votes of AHINDA, Congress has a very good support base in terms of votes of social background
 pichley chunaav main congress ko is varg ke 54 fisadi vot mili the, jabaki bijepi or jedy (es) ko 18-18 fisadi vot mili the
 Out of the OBC category, 38 percent votes were received by Congress, 29 percent votes for BJP and 20 percent votes for JD (S)
 daliton, adivaasiyon ormusalamaanon nejamkar congress ko vot die the
 Congress got 50 per cent, 44 per cent and 65 per cent votes respectively from these three sections
 iske mukaable bijepi ko daliton ke 20 fisadi, adivaasiyon ke 25 fisadi or musalamaanon ke mahaj 11 fisadi vot mili the
 It is worth noting that this pattern of votes has been maintained in Karnataka for the last several elections
 rajya main jati or samudaay ke voton ke mahatv ko dekhte hue hi sabhi dal is hisaab se apni ranneeti bhi banaate rahe hai
 Since 1952 till now, most of the Chief Ministers of the state have been from Vokkalinga community
 isliye yah dharna ban gai he ki ye donon samudaay rajya main sabase taqatvar hai
 But Siddaramaiah is trying to change this perception
 aligarh muslim uniwarsity (amu)ko alpsankhyak santhaan kaa darja dene ko lekar supreme court kii samvidhan peeth sunwaayee karegi
 Earlier, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court was hearing the case
 isse pehle centre sarkaar ke halafnaamein par AMU ne supreme court se jawaab dene ke liye chaar hafte kaa samay maanga tha
 Explain that the central government had filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court to withdraw the appeal of the UPA government
 centre sarkaar ne supreme court main kaha ki AMU ko alpsankhyak santhaan kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa
 The government, in its affidavit, based the Judgment of the Constitution Bench in the Aziz Basha case in 1967, stating that the AMU was created by the central government and not by the Muslim
 centre sarkaar ne halafname main 1972 main sansad main bahes ke dauraan tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke bayanon kaa hawala diya he, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki agar is santhaan ko alpsankhyak kaa darja diya gaya to desh main anya alpsankhyak varg yaa dharmik sansthaanon ko inkaar karne main pareshaani hogi
 Amidst all this, the Central Government has also withdrawn the letters of HRD Ministry during the UPA Government in which 50% reservation was given to Muslims in the Faculty of Medicine
 centre ne 1967 ke supreme court ke jajment ke khilaaf 1981 main sansad main sanshodhan bill paas karte hue AMU ko alpsankhyak kaa darja diya, use bhi modi sarkaar ne galat tehraaya he
 The affidavit states that making amendments to nullify the Judgment of the Court is thus against the constitutional framework
 gauratlab he kialigarh muslim uniwarsity (eemyu) ko alpsankhyak kaa darja die jane ke maamle main centre sarkaar ke halafname par eemyu ne bhi halafname ke jariye apana jawaab daakhil karte hue kaha thaki modi sarkaar kaa halafanama raajnneeti se prerit he or centre ko upie sarkaar kaa halafanama waapas lene kii ijaajat nahin deni chahie
 The Supreme Court has asked the Center to file its reply in three weeks
 eemyu ne kaha thaki sarkaar badalane ke saath duusari sarkaar kaa najariya nahin badalanaa chahie
 AMU is the oldest Muslim university in the country
 ise mila alpsankhyak kaa darja sabhi muslimon ke liye khaas myne rakhata he
 The central government had filed an affidavit withdrawing the appeal of the UPA government in the Supreme Court
 modi sarkaar ne supreme court main daakhil halafname main kaha he ki eemyu ko alpsankhyak santhaan kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa
 In the affidavit, the Modi government made the basis for the Judgment of the Constitution Bench in the Aziz Basha case in 1967, which said that AMU was created by the central government and not by the Muslim
 centre ne upie sarkaar ke vakt maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke un patron ko bhi waapas le liya he jinamein faikalti aaf medicine main muslimon ko 50 fisadi aarakshan diya gaya tha
 The Center passed the amendment bill in Parliament against the Supreme Court Judgment of 1967 in 1981 and gave minority status to AMU, which has also been denied by the Modi government
 halafname main kaha gaya he ki is tarah court ke jajment ko nishprabhavi karne ke liye sanshodhan karnaa sanvaidhanik dhaanche ke khilaaf he

 america kerashtrapati baraak obama kii bharat yatrapar puri duniya kii nigahen lagi thi
 The warmth of Obama's hospitality in India, the same enthusiasm in America

 But the tour upset two neighbors of India
 donon padosi mulk bhale hi dikhaane ke liye kuch bhi kahenmgar unki niyat main khot safadikhai padati he
 Restless China When Obama was being given a grand welcome in India, China was stung
 obama bharat or modi kii tarif kar rahe the to hamaare padosi desh china kii sarkaar baichaiyn ho rahi thi
 China's attitude was so strong that it even gave India the instruction to stay away from America
 aae din bhartiya seemaa main ghuspaith karne vaale ye kaise bardaasht kar sakate hai ki duniya kaa sabase taqatvar aadmi bharat main teen din rahe or bharat ke saath apane rishton ko or majboot karne kii disha main kaam kare
 China immediately stated its friendship with Pakistan
 ek bayaan jari kar paak ko apana sadabahaar dost bataa diya
 Not only this, Pakistan Army Chief General Raheel Sharif went on a tour of China
 vahaan donon desh ek duusare kii tarif ke kaside pard rahe the
 Meaning that both our neighbors were putting their jealousy in the garland of words
 china kah rahaa he ki bharat, china kii badhati takat ko rokane ke liye america ke saath apane rishton ko majboot karne kii koshish main juta he
 Because he himself is dreaming of becoming a big power in Asia
 haalanki china ne ishaaron main ye bhi kaha ki bharat or china ko ek duusare se majboot sambadhon ke bare main sochna chahie
 All these things are enough to express the sting and uneasiness of China
 pareshaan pakistanobama ke bharat daure se agar china baichaiyn he to pakistan bhi kam pareshaan nahin
 The Nawaz Sharif government accepted the sweets of Republic Day, giving a strong statement of friendship
 lekin vahaan kii media ne sab sach jaahir kar diya
 Even his anger could not be hidden and there was no problem
 obama kii bharat yatra ke pehle din hi paak kii napak niyat saamne aa gai
 Firing was carried out at the border
 duusare din vahaan ke ek news channel ne sabhyataa ko taak par rakhkar piem modi ko 'gujarat kaa kasaai' or 'gadhaa' bataa diya
 There is another reason for this jealousy and trouble of the Pakistani government that Pakistan had given a party to visit Obama before visiting India, but Obama had rejected Pak's claim
 aise main pakistan ne china ke saath apane rishton ko jaahir karne kii kavayad shuru kar di
 India's success: Obama, the world's most powerful leader, insisted on making India his solid partner

 The process of war between Delhi Government and Lieutenant Governor has not stopped

 Documents received by NDTV are telling that the railway is going to move towards privatization
 saath hi suraksha or gati badhaane par bhi jor rahegaa or tikat main ho rahe ghate se ubarne ko lekar sabsidi chhodane kaa vikalp bhi yatriyon ko diya jayega
 If the Railways properly implement their 100-day plan, then after three months, trains will run between Delhi and Mumbai at a speed of 160 km
 15
 The current journey of 5 hours will be 10 hours
 isi tarah dilli haavda ke bich kaa safar 17 ghante se ghat kar 12 ghante rah jayega
 By the way, the most important issue in this action plan is privatization
 iske mutabik ab tak mantralay kii hari jhandi par daudane vaali rail privet players bhi dauda paaenge
 The railway has started exploring its possibility
 apane agenda main railway ne saaf saaf likhaa he ki iskaa nirdhaaran biding kii prakriya ke jariye hoga
 Railways will also talk to their trade unions to get agreement on private operators
 lekin ol india railway mens federation ( AIRF) ko is par aapattti he

 ye duniya tabaahi kii choukhat par khadi he
 In such a situation, one can only ask for a world war
 agar aisa hua to har taraf tabaahi kaa manjar hoga
 This concern is also more because the world-renowned prophet Nostradamus has long ago predicted that in the year 2018 there will be a third world war
 nastredamas ne kaha tha ki ye teesraa vishwa yuddh do dishaao ke bich hoga
 That means the third world war will be between east and west
 do dishaao ke bich yudhduniya ke sabase bade najumi yani bhavishyavaktaa nastredamas ne bhavishyavaanee kii he ki saal 2018 main teesraa vishwayuddh hoga
 According to this prediction, the third world war will not be between two and more countries but between two directions
 yani purab or pashchim ke bich
 This world war would be so terrible that after it is over, only a few people on this earth will be alive to enjoy peace
 haalanki zaruri nahin he ki nastredamas kii bhavishyavaanee sach ho
 This has happened before also
 duniya main hai 15 hajaar parmaanu bamduniya ke tamaam deshon ne khud tabaahi kaa saamaan jamaa kar rakhaa he
 At present there are more than 15 thousand and fifty nuclear bombs all over the world
 inamen se ek-ek bam ek bhare-puure shahar ko shmaashan banane ke liye kaaphi he
 The US caused havoc by dropping atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
 vaisaa hi manjar agar puri duniya main hoga to koi use dekhne vaala bhi shaayad nahin bachegaa
 Both sides are strong, given the current situation that is being created, it can be said that if there is a world war, then it can really be between two directions
 kyonki ek taraf america or uske sahyogi nato desh hai to duusari taraf uttar korea ke liye dhaal banakar khadey nazar aa rahe china or rus hai
 If the arms of these two sides are kept face to face, then they look at par
 donon taraf hai kai deshek sambhavit aakade ke zarie samajhie ki parmaanu hathiyaaron se las tamaam desh kis disha main badhate nazar aa rahe hai
 America , France, England and Israel stand with America can be seen
 to vahiin uttar korea ke saath china or rus khadey ho sakate hai
 So let's see who has how many weapons
 donon guton ke hathiyaaron kaa aankadamerica ke paas sabase zyaada 6800 parmaanu hathiyaar hai vahiin france ke paas 300, england ke paas 215 or israel ke paas kareeb 80 parmaanu hathiyaar hai
 That means the total number of nuclear weapons in the US group was 7395
 vahiin duusari taraf uttar korea ke gut main uttar korea ke paas 6 parmaanu hathiyaar maane jate hai
 Although some agencies give these numbers around ten
 vahiin agar china or rus ko uttar korea ke saath mana jaae to china ke paas 260 or rus ke paas 7000 parmaanu hathiyaar hai
 Adding to their total number, the North Korea group has 7270
 yani donon guton ke paas parmaanu hathiyaaron kii taadaad takreeban baraabar he
 India has 140 nuclear weapons, India and Pakistan have not been included in this list because what will be their stand in the event of war is not clear yet
 lekin donon deshon ke paas agar parmaanu hathiyaar kii taadaad kii baat kii jaae to bharat ke paas jahaan 130 parmaanu hathiyaar hai vahiin pakistan ke paas 140 parmaanu hathiyaar hai
 If the 2 atomic bombs ravaged two cities in Japan, what would the earth do with more than 15,000 thousand bombs
 vishwayuddh hua to vaaki main shaayad shanti dekhne ke liye kuch hi log bachenge
 This is because these countries also have such missiles that can revolve around the earth with nuclear bombs
 kai hajaar kimi
 Missiles can reach up to 15 thousand kilometers, while France has missiles up to 10,000 kilometers
 england ke paas 12 hazaar kilometre tak maar karne vaali misile hai
 Israel has missiles capable of hitting 11 and a half thousand kilometers
 vahiin uttar korea gut main uttar korea ke paas 13 hazaar kilometre tak maar karne vaali misile hai
 China has 14 thousand kilometers of missiles
 jabaki rus ke paas 15 hazaar kilometre tak maar karne vaali misile hai
 Earth will ruin just one button
 US missiles can reach every city of North Korea and missiles of North Korea can reach every city of America
 yahi haal baaki deshon kii mixilon kaa bhi he
 And the shocking thing is that the heads of missiles of these countries have their heads of state in their tables and briefcases

 bijepi ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne argedy supremeo lalu prasad or jediu ke varisht netaa nitish kumaar kii dushmani bhulaakar chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karne par somvaar ko kaha ki isse lalu or nitish par bihar main phir se kathith jangal raaj thopane ke paap nahin dhul jaaenge
 Taking a dig at Lalu and Nitish meeting through Facebook, Sushil alleged that the RJD chief Lalu Prasad and former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar pretended to be hugged would not wash away the sins of imposing jungle raj on Bihar
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki lalu prasad ne jahaan mandalwaad kaa jhansa dekar 15 saal tak bihar ko gundgardee or garibi main bandhak banaaye rakhaa vahiin nitish kumaar ne dharmanirpekshata kaa bahaanaa banaakar jangalraj-2 kaa rasta taiyaar kar diya
 Both have joined hands to save their power, not for the betterment of Bihar
 susheel ne kaha ki bees saal tak ek-duusare ko khari-khoti sunaane vaale in netaaon ne aniatik mail se 2005 or 2010 ke janadesh kaa makhul udaaya he
 He said that the public did not vote for Nitish Kumar to hug Lalu Prasad
 yadi yahi karnaa tha to unhen mukhyamantri pad se istipha dene kii bajaay vidhansabha ko bhang kara kar nayaa janadesh praapt karnaa chahie tha
 Sushil said that lalu-nitish call each other brothers
 in donon ne aadhe man se hi sahi agar ek saath chalanaa sweekaar liya he, to inhen aisi raajnneetik majaburi paidaa karne ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ko dhanyavad dena chahie
 People who do such selfish reconciliation disappear on their own
 unhone kaha ki logon ko khub yaad he ki lalu prasad ne kabhi bihar kii bijepi-jediu sarkaar ke tej vikaas kaa majaak udaaya tha
 Today they are making fun of the Narendra Modi government's decision to provide bullet trains to the country
 susheel ne kaha ki lalu ne kabhi suryagrahan ke dauraan nitish kumaar ke biscuit khaane ko ashubh bataaya tha
 They are calling the popular BJP leader Narendra Modi inauspicious today
 nitish sarkaar par aarope lagaate hue unhone kaha ki satta main bane rahane ke liye nitish bhale hi bihar ko andhvishwaas or garibi main dhakelne vaale lalu prasad kii har baat bhul jaaen, lekin kisi ko bhi maaf nahin karegi

 a post shared by Sapna Choudhary Club (@isapnachaudhary) on Nov 22, 2018 at 3:32am PSTA post shared by Sapna Choudhary Club (@isapnachaudhary) on Nov 21, 2018 at 10:08am PST Anil Ambani's Reliance Group's financial services businesses are in trouble
 inaki lagaataar kai agenciyon ne reating ghadaa di he
 Rating agencies are skeptical of the group's ability to repay its debt
 inke mutabik kuch had tak usee tarah ke karj diphalt kii sthiti banati dikh rahi he, jaise ki IL&FS or DHFL ke maamle main hua tha
 So the big question is how will Anil Ambani get out of this crisis and will his elder brother Mukesh Ambani come forward to help this time too
 reating agenciyon care (CARE) or ikraa (ICRA) ne reliance commercial finance (RCF) or reliance home finance (RHF) kii reating gata di he
 Icra also downgraded the commercial paper of Reliance Capital earlier
 khabar yah bhi aa rahi he ki reliance capital aaarasief or aarechaef ke liye stritegic invester laane kii yojana bana rahi he
 According to Business Standard, talks are on with Blackstone, Carlyle, Brookfield and the Piramal Group to buy a larger stake in RHF
 aarechaefeel main reliance capital kii 51 fisadi hissedari he
 It is worth noting that before this, Anil Ambani was caught in a debt crisis in which the sword of arrest was hanging on him for non-payment of arrears of Rs 550 crore to Ericsson, a telecom equipment maker
 march maheene main reliance communications (arcom) ne sweden kii doorsanchaar upkaran banane vaali company arikson ko 550 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kar diya
 But Anil Ambani paid this money from his elder brother Mukesh Ambani
 agar company aisa karne main vifal rahati he to arcom ke chairman anil ambani ko 3 maheene jail kii sajaa kaatani pad sakati thi
 In such a situation, elder brother Mukesh Ambani came for help
 musiibat main madad ke liye anil ambani ne bade bhai mukesh ambani or bhabhi nita kaa shukriya kiya
 About three years ago, Anil Ambani group company Reliance Communications (rcom) started defaulting in repayment of its debt of around Rs 45,000 crore
 samooh ne apane asset kii bikri kar kareeb 60 fisadi karj chukaa dene kii yojana banaai he
 It is claimed that the total debt of the group will come down to Rs 48,645 crore from asset sale
 akele samooh kii doorsanchaar company reliance communications (arcom) par hi 38 bakaaedaaron kaa kareeb 47,000 karod rupee kaa karj he or vah date ristraccharing prakriya se guzar rahi he
 The company hopes to raise around Rs 25,000 crore by selling its spectrum, fiber, telecom towers, etc
 isi tarah is company kii navi mumbai sthit 125 acre property ko bechney se kareeb 10,000 karod rupee mil sakate hai
 Recently, ADAG group company Reliance Infrastructure sold its power business in Mumbai to Adani Transmission Limited
 yah bikri kareeb 18,800 karod rupee main hui he
 Reliance Naval & Engineering Ltd, a group company, has a debt of around Rs 5,300 crore
 ise chukaane ke liye company insalvency prakriya se guzar rahi he
 The sale of spectrum could not take off due to the dot seeking bank guarantee
 lone bhugtan na kar paane kii vajah se arcom ne farvari main diwalia hone ke liye aavedan kiya
 Therefore, now the market is waiting eagerly to save Reliance Capital and its associate companies, this time, elder brother Mukesh Ambani will come forward again
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki saat asset mainagement companiyon ne anil ambani samooh kii teen gaiyr banking vittiya companiyon kii 62 yojanaon main nivesh kiya he
 Similarly two mutual funds have invested in downgraded companies

 These are added to preserve the taste of the food
 khaane ko adhik swaadisht banane ke liye masaale, haraa dhaniya, pudinaa aadi daaliye
 In this way the amount of salt will also be reduced

 ' In Uttar Pradesh, the person who once used to speak under the rule of Bahujan Samaj Party, is now ready to hold the hand of Congress
 bispi supremeo mayawati ke kabhi rhite hand main rah chuke nasimuddin siddiki guuruuvaar ko congress main shaamil hai
 After being shown the way out of BSP, for the last one year, Nasimuddin was looking for a new political base for himself
 congress partimen apni entry ko dhamaakedaar banane ke liye vah puure laav lashkar ke saath congress se haath milaayenge
 Along with Nasimuddin, many other leaders are also being claimed to join the Grand Old Party
 inamen purv mantri, purv saansad, purv vidhayak samet uttar pradesh ke kai sthaneey netaa bataae ja rahe hai
 In the presence of senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and Uttar Pradesh Congress President Raj Babbar at the Congress headquarters, Nasimuddin Siddiqui will read the Congress Name
 ek vakt tha jabansimuddin siddiqibaspa ke sabase bada muslim cheharaa maane jate the
 Uttar Pradesh Nasimuddin's hank was worth seeing under Mayawati's rule
 bispi ke brahman chehre satish chandra mishra ke saath nasimuddin ko jodakar mayawati ne muslim-brahman-dalit combination ko kabhi kamyaabi se aage badhaayaa tha
 But everything changed in May last year
 nasimuddin ko bahanji ke gusse kaa shikaar hona padaa
 She was dismissed from the party by Mayawati on charges of rigging ticket distribution in West UP
 nasimuddin or congress ke bich siyaasi khichdi kaaphi samay se pak rahi thi
 Nasimuddin has also met Rahul Gandhi twice
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki nasimuddin kii congress main entry ke peeche party ke upi incharge gulam nabi aaazaad ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai he

 party ko 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main upi kii chadhaai mushkil najar aa rahi he
 The Congress has to face Modi at the Center and Yogi's pair in UP

 In such a situation, in the political arithmetic of Uttar Pradesh with 18 percent Muslim population, Nasimuddin Siddiqui's arrival in the Congress also suits the Congress
 nasimuddin bhi pichley ek saal se uttar pradesh ke siyaasi samundar main tairne ke liye jugat laga rahe the
 Sometimes a National Bahujan Morcha was formed and sometimes Samajwadi Party also thought of riding a bicycle

 After this, the fiery Sukhbir attacked him
 ek taar se uskaa galaa ghont kar vahaan se faraar ho gaya

 yogendra yadav ne kaha ki main party kaa ek anushaasit kaaryakarta banakar rahoonga
 The party which will give responsibility, will play
 aam aadmi party ek mahaan party he
 The meeting of the National Executive has ended
 ye tasviir baithak ke samaapt hone ke baad kii he
 When Yogendra Yadav came out, the cameras surrounded him
 sab jaananaa chaahate the ki kya hua, yogendra yadav kya bolenge
 Yogendra said that i will accept whatever responsibility the party gives
 prashanth bhushan bhi baahar aae or kaha ki ham or yogendra yadav polytical afaire cameti piesi ke member nahin hai
 Prashant Bhushan said that whatever decision has been taken is by a majority and we accept
 kaaryakarini main bahumat se faisla hua
 There were 21 permanent members and six state convenors i
e
 25 out of total 27 members were present
 yogendra or prashanth bhushan ko sirf 8 vot mili jisase unke piesi se baahar hone kaa rasta saafe ho gaya
 Kumar Vishwas said that both would be given new responsibilities
 nai jimmedaari kya hogi, is par ab khub atakalein lagengi
 Whether or not she will meet or how it will be is not clear yet
 dinabhar khabar aati rahi ki yogendra ko maharashtra kaa prabharee or prashanth ko legal cell kii jimmedaari di jaaegi magar is par aupchaarik ghoshnaa yahi hui ki nai jimmedaari di jaaegi
 Arvind Kejriwal was not in this meeting, but he must have had contact with the members
 arvind ke istife ko kaaryakarini ne khaarij kar diya
 This meeting, which lasted for eight hours, indicates that in the Aam Aadmi Party the decision is taken by the formality of majority, but it is not clear whether the matter is resolved or both these leaders were sidelined
 magar donon netaaon ke bayaan bataa rahe hai ki ve saadhaaran kaaryakarta rahakar bhi party main bane rahenge
 The way the apology started on Wednesday morning, it seemed that there is no lack of goodwill in the Aam Aadmi Party
 ashish khetaan ne apane twit ke liye maafee maangi, yogendra yadav ne kaha ki main bhi sudharuunga
 Kumar Vishwas said that they are talking to both the sides and will settle the matter
 aisi bhalmansahat mulak bayanon ke saath saath channelon par khabaren bhi flash ho rahi thim jisase lag rahaa tha ki sab kuch tay he
 Yogendra Yadav also said that good news will be received in the evening, but what did the closed walls of the farm house of Kapashera knew that it would take so long to be decided even after all was decided
 kapasaheda farm house ke baahar sthaneey logon kii bheed jamaa thi
 Some AAP supporters also brought good-day pictures of Yogendra, Prashant Bhushan, Manish Sisodia and Arvind Kejriwal
 aap united kaa hashtag bhi chhap kar le aae
 They all demanded that you do not break
 aam aadmi party ke kuch shubhachintakon ne kaaryakarini ko khat bhi likhaa or kaha ki ham sab aap main ho rahi ghatnaon ko lekar chintit hai
 Especially with the growing intolerance to criticisms within you
 un awaazon ko kinare karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he jo aantarik loktantr, javabdehi or paardarshita kii maang kar rahe hai
 There are protests and disagreements in any party but it should be handled in a responsible manner
 is par filmkaar anand patavardhan, himanshu thakkar, purushottam agarwal jaise logon ke hastakshar hai
 Did the matter get resolved prashanth or yogendra ke baahar hone kii baat to pehle se hi kahi ja rahi thi
 It is a big thing that the party now has the seal of majority on this decision
 kya yah saaf he ki jo sawaal uthaae gaye the un par koi charchaa hui yaa faisla hua
 Only Kumar Vishwas and Pankaj have been authorized to tell all this
 lekin raajnneeti isi ko kehete hai
 At least whatever happened happened face to face
 donon kheme aath ghante tak kaaryakarini main apni baton ko lekar bhide rahe honge
 But everything is not what is said after the meeting
 baithak main kya hua vahaan asli khabar hogi
 Has Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan once again decided that Arvind Kejriwal has control over the party
 party ke sadsy apane netaa ko jaanate or pahachaanate hai
 It is also no less important that Yogendra and Prashant got 8 votes in the executive
 iskaa matlab he ki aath logon ne arvind kejariwal yaa unke samarthakon se alag raay rakhi
 Do all these things give credibility to the internal democracy process apart from this controversy
 yah sahi he ki jo netaa hoga or jisaki pakad hogi wo baazi maaregaa lekin baahar hone waalon kaa ricard bhi itnaa kharaab nahin he
 So did democracy follow in the Aam Aadmi Party or those who spoke in the name of democracy were punished
 bijepi or congress ke netaaon ne hamalaa bol diya he ki yogendra yadav ko bolne kii sazaa mili he
 The question is what Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan achieved by going out
 is vivaad se arvind kejariwal ne kya hasil kiya
 Did they get acquitted that only they run in the party or it has been proved that eight people are members of the executive by speaking against them
 aap main se jo raajnneeti main bhagidaari karte hai yaa bhavishya main karnaa chaahate hai unhen is baat kaa puraa khyaal rakhana chahie ki party kaise chalati he
 The entire achievement of a political party should not depend on how that government runs
 party kaise chalati he yaa chalaaya jaataa he yah sawaal sarkaar se bhi bada sawaal he

 Gaushala management has to buy fodder from Chima Mandi in Punjab at double price
 aamtaur par jo chaara dhai se teen rupee prati kilo ke hisaab se mil jaataa tha uske liye gaushala prabandhan ko ab 6: 30 rupee prati kilo dena pad rahaa he
 Manager of Gopal Gau Sadan Gaushala, situated on the Delhi Haryana border, Rashtrapal said, "there is less space in the cowshed, the Delhi government has not given funds for a year and a half, and the fodder godowns of the cowshed are lying vacant if the government gives money on time
 Fodder would have been stored in the season itself
 "15 acre main faili is gaushala kii kshamta keval 3200 govansh rakhane kii he jabaki yahaan par 4500 gaayen rah rahi hai
 This is the reason why Gaushala has now refused to take the mcd's cows and has now demanded more land for the Gaushala from the LG of Delhi and from the government
 gaushalaon main jagah kii kami kii vajah se sijan main chaara store nahin ho paata
 Therefore, they have to buy at a higher price as soon as the feed is over

 Due to more deaths of cows here, it has been evacuated at present
 shri krishna gaushala main 7740 gaayon ke rahane kii kshamta he lekin yahaan par 8500 gaayen rakhi ja rahi hai
 The Harekrishna Gaushala at Surhera has a capacity to hold 2794 cows, but there are almost twice as many cows here

 dilli main shanivaar ko yojit india today camind roxvent main upi ke purv mukhyamantrikhilesh yadavane bijepi kii raajnneeti ko sampradayik bataaya
 He responded to the statement of BJP leaders, stating that in the previous SP government, only Muslims were compensated
 akhilesh yadav ne kaha, 'maine kaha ki upi kaa chunaav sampradayikta ke saath ladaa gaya tha
 BJP leaders had said that nothing happens on the death of Hindus, 50 lakhs are helped on the death of Muslims
 'sapa par jativaadee party hone ke aarope lagate rahe hai
 The BJP has often surrounded the SP on this issue
 is aarope ke jawaab main akhilesh ne kaha, 2019 main aisa nahin hoga
 Now we have applied their formula on them only
 ab wo nahin jeet paaenge, isliye haar rahe hai
 If we make alliances then it is said that there are casteist people, if BJP does it is called social engineering
 is soshal ejineering kii hindi kya hoti he
 People of BJP do not want to contest elections on the issue, we do not want to let them wander through the issues
 upi ke pichley vidhansabha chunaav main sapa kii haar hui thi
 Congress and SP had a coalition in that election
 gathbandhan ke liye rahul gandhi or akhilesh yadav donon ne gambhirtha se kadam badaye the
 However, both parties had to face severe defeats
 bhavi chunaavon main kya donon partiyaan phir ekasaath aaengi? iske jawaab main akhilesh ne kaha ki rahul ji se hamaari acchhee dosti thi
 i am talking about that election (assembly election)
 tab bijepi ke log ghabara gaye the
 i am such a youngster that once i make friends, i never leave again

 Party president Rahul Gandhi is adamant on resigning, while the activists are wondering how to get out of this situation
 idhar loksabhaa kaa sadan bhi shuru ho gaya he
 Meanwhile, the Congress worker has taken out a poster, comparing UPA Chairperson and former Congress President Sonia Gandhi with Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi
 ye poster prayagraj congress ke kaaryakarta haseeb ahamed ne chhapavaya he
 The poster depicts Sonia Gandhi as the queen of Jhansi
 unke alaava poster main rahul-priyanka-rajeev-indira gandhi, pramod tiwari or kuch anya netaaon kii tasviir he
 What is written on the picture is also special
 isamen likhaa gaya he, ‘chamak uthi san 91 main wo talwaar puraani he, khub ladi mardaani wo to indira, rajeev kii rani he’
 Let us tell you that Haseeb Ahmed is a Prayagraj worker and is known only as poster boy
 aksar unke dwaara banaae gaye poster media or soshal media par charchaa kaa vishay rahete hai
 Then whether there is a demand to bring Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to Congress, Rahul Gandhi has to be called the future Prime Minister or there are many such demands which the workers want to fulfill
 haal hi main haseeb ne rahul gandhi ko ek khulaa khat bhi likhaa tha
 When Rahul Gandhi was adamant on resigning from the post of President, he issued a letter and wrote that the party under Rahul's leadership has gone ahead and fought fiercely
 isliye agar unhone istipha diya to kai kaaryakarta aatmahatya kar lenge
 Let me tell you that the Congress has suffered a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections for 2 consecutive times
 2014 ke chunaav main 44 to is baar sirf 52 siton par simtane vaali congress ke paas itane number bhi nahin he ki use loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa kaa pad mil sake
 Something similar happened in the last Lok Sabha also
 raajnneeti main arsh or farsh ke bich kaa antar itnaa kam hota he ki kab koun kahaan pahunch jaae samaj main nahin aata he
 Just 4 months ago during the assembly elections, Vasundhara Raje from BJP and Sachin Pilot from Congress were the face of both parties
 lekin itane maheene main hi sab kuch badal gaya he
 If the Congress is seeking votes on the popularity of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, then the BJP is sitting on the hope of PM Narendra Modi
 rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan satta sanbhaalane kaa daawa karne vaali purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje or congress ke pradesh adhyaksh sachin payalat loksabhaa chunaav main kahin najar nahin aa rahe hai
 Within four months, their fate will be so reversed that they too would never have thought
 congress kii taraf se chunavi kaman siem ashok gahalot sambhaal rahe hai
 Pilot is seen as the state president for the name, even Ashok Gehlot is taking a meeting of party workers
 loksabhaa chunaav main ummidavaar koun hoga iskaa aakhri faisla bhi ashok gahalot hi kar rahe hai
 Who would have thought that in 4 months, the position of Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot will be that of a common minister
 congress ke netaa kah rahe hai ki rajasthan main gahalot narendra modi se zyada lokapriy hai
 On the face of Ashok Gehlot, people will vote for the Congress
 congress ke prabharee mahasachiv avinaash pandey or swasthya mantri raghu sharma kaa maananaa he ki aaj survey karvaa len, rajasthan main ashok gohalot modi se bahut lokapriy hai
 Ask the BJP President about Vasundhara ji
 
 
 main kya bataaunudhar, haar ke baad vasundhara raaje kahaan hai kisi ko pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 It is being said that she has been sitting in Delhi for the last 4 days
 magar bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah milane tak kaa vakt nahin de rahe hai
 Wherever 4 months ago, she used to be the most powerful leader of BJP
 unki marji ke bina pradesh adhyaksh tak nahin ban paa rahaa tha
 She was showing eyes to even the Prime Minister and the National President, but Vasundhara Raje is missing from all the bjp's banks for the Lok Sabha elections
 yahaan par sidhe-sidhe bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah saare faisle le rahe hai
 Asked about the matter, MP from Jaipur Gramin and Union Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said, "ask the BJP president about Vasundhara ji
" 
 
 main kya bataaun
 This battle between Modi vs Ashok Gehlot is not the first
 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bhi in donon chehron par congress or bijepi ne daanv lagaaya tha
 In the first round, Narendra Modi won
 ab ek baar phir se congress or bijepi donon loksabhaa chunaav main inhi do chehron par ladane ja rahi hai

 unhen pehle police remand par bheja gaya tha or baad main adaalat nenyayik hiraasatamen tihaad jail bhej diya tha
 Tomardilli police, who are not cooperating in the investigation, have already claimed that Tomar is not cooperating with them in the investigation and is not answering questions in the inquiry

 He felt that the fear of quaid-e-azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah that Muslims would not be safe in India after independence, will now come true
 videshi media ko bhi yahi samaj aayaa ki india main hindu sarkaar ban gai he
 But today, even after nearly 70 years of independence, 1
3 million Muslims in Burma (myanmar) are homeless
 ye musalmaan rohingiyamusalmanhai
 The Sufi sect are Sunni Muslims and migrated from Bengal and lived in Myanmar for several decades before independence
 puraane hisaab-kitaab main inhen burma kaa naagarik mana gaya
 In the region of Burma where Rohingia Muslims live, 98 percent of them are Muslims
 lekin puure burma kii jansankhya jode to ye musalmaan alpsankhyak hai
 Followers of Buddhism have been opposing their citizenship in Burma
 2015 main inmusalamaanon kii naagariktako myanmar sarkaar ne khaarij kar diya he
 Now he wants these Muslims to go back to the area of undivided Bengal that is now under Bangladesh
 ye musalmaan hai, lekin bangladesh inhen lenaa nahin chahta kyonki bangladesh se to hindu ko chhodie, musalmaan tak palaayan kar bharat main gaiyrkanoonee sharnaarthi banane kii firaaq main kai dashakon se lage hai
 Now the question is that if the Rohingia Muslims of Burma are from Bangladesh and their dispute is before independence, will Pakistan accept these Muslims in their country today? India has nothing to do with this matter because during independence and partition, Rohingia Muslims lived in the area of bangladesh or East Pakistan which was Muslim majority
 bantwaare ke niyam ke mutabik ye swaabhaavik taur par pakistan kaa hissaa the
 But due to the malaise, helplessness and vandalism in East Pakistan, they settled in the non-residential areas of Burma
 aaj yah rohingiya musalmaan beghar hai
 His case remains a very complex issue internationally
 burma se ye nirvasit hai
 Call it second class citizens or refugees without citizenship
 vahiin america or europe ke desh in musalamaanon ko bataur rifuji lene se shaayad kataraaen kyonki vah khud musalmaan sharnaarthiyon se gambhir chunautiyon kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Despite this, these Muslims cannot look towards Pakistan or Bangladesh
 kyonki in donon hi deshon kii haalat islamic jehad or aatankwaad ke chalate badi chunautiyon ke daur se guzar rahe hai
 Now Pakistan, like these Rohingia Muslims, is a Sunni majority country
 ye rohingiya musalmaan unki ore madad kisi madad ke liye nahin dekh sakate kyonki pakistan main aise sharnaarthiyon kii haalat bahut badtar he
 There is no such place in Pakistan for Shia, Sufi, Hindu and Buddhist people
 myanmar main to sirf inaki naagarikta or jameen chhini he, pakistan pahunchane par to sawaal inke dharm par khadaa ho jayega or lau of da land ke mutabik inhen bhi gaiyr-musalmaan ghoshit kar diya jayega

 ab 14 saal se kam umr ke bacchon se mehnat mazdooree jaisaa shaareerik kaam karana jurm hoga
 An amendment to the country's child labor law has changed the definition of child labor
 ab kisi bhi surat main 14 saal se kam umr ke bacchon ko kaam par nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Amendments to the Child Labor Act are now left only to the President's signature
 raashtrapati kii muhar lagane ke bauentarrashtriya shram sanghathantak isaki soochna bhejni hogi ki hamane apane desh main ye praavdhaan lagu kar die hai
 So that there is proper care for the physical and mental health of the children
 is vajah se bacchon ko rhite tu ajukeshan yani artii kaa phayda milegaa
 If there is a fear of not sending the child to work, then he will be sent to school
 nae praavdhaan se aaenge nae parivartandekhanaa ye hoga ki nayaa praavdhaan kaisebal mazdooreeper nakel kasega or bacchon kii shiksha kaa rasta saaf karegaa
 Till now, it was legal to provide wages to children below 14 years of age in light ventures considered to be safe
 pehle to ye chhot thi ki pariwarik udyog yaa kaarobaar he to 14 saal se kam umr kaa kisi kaa bhi baccha vahaan madadgaar ke taur par bhartee kar liya jaataa tha
 But now children will be kept away from any kind of labor
 kaarobaar agar paariwarik he to sirf khun ke rishton masalan mata-pita, chachaa, mamaa, buaa kaa agar paariwarik kaarobaar yaa gharelu udyog he to baccha skool avadhi ke baad yaa pehle vahaan sirf madad kar saktaa he mazdooree nahin
 Can not be taken from children of any kind, the government is now making a list of dangerous, less dangerous and safe industries
 pehali baar banaai ja rahi is suchi main aise khatarnaak udyogon yaa kaarobaar kii paribhaasha or dayera zyada saaf kiya jayega taaki kisi kanfusion yaa dhundhalepan kaa phayda koi naa uthaa sake
 There will be many other industries related to fireworks, acid or chemicals in such dangerous industries
 pehle 18 peshewar or 65 processing vaale dhandhe main bacchon se kaam lene kii chhot thi
 But since no work can be taken from children below 14 years, this list has become useless
 ab milegi doguni sajaarhi baat in praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan karne waalon ko di jane vaali sajaa kii to usamen bhi dogune yaa isse bhi zyada sakht praavdhaan kiye gayi hai
 That is, earlier these rules were that there was a provision of fine of up to ten thousand rupees or imprisonment from three months to a year or both if found guilty under the Child Labor Act
 lekin ab pehali baar pakade jane par 20 hajaar se pachaas hajaar rupee tak jurmaana yaa chah maheene se teen saal tak kaid yaa phir donon kaa praavdhaan he
 Now the provision of funds for children is a provision of imprisonment for one year to three years if caught second time
 ab bal shram kanoon ke ulanghan main pakade gaye logon ke khilaaf sangyeya aparaadh kaa mukadmaa darj hoga
 That is, it is necessary to appear before the magistrate for bail
 ab bal shram se chhudaae gaye bacchon ke punarvaas ke liye alag se fund yani kosh kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 There was no such fund before
 is vajah se bachche ke punarvaas yaa phir shiksha kaa koi jariya nahin tha
 Due to which there was a possibility or compulsion of the child to return to the business
 lekin ab aisa nahin hoga aisa bharosa jataayaa gaya he
 Children love toys very much, on seeing them, their facial expressions begin to show their happiness clearly
 in khilaunon se hi bachche kaaphi kuch sikhte hai masalan colors kii pahchaan, cunting, teble or bhi jane kya-kya
 But often parents start buying toys for children without thinking, which affects their mental development
 agar aap chaahate hai ki aapkaa baccha active ho or usamen seekhney kii kshamta kaa nirantar vikaas ho, to bacchon ke liye khilaunon kaa sillection soch-samaj kar karen
 Most educational toys are those that teach children to mingle with an adult without any support and condition
 mata-pita kaa atension paane ke liye khilone opshan nahin hone chahie
 Provide safe, inexpensive toys to children that have developmental use
 bacchon ke khilone aise hone chahien, jo unhen vikaas or rachanaatmakataa ko protsaahit karne vaale kshetron main seekhney or vikaas ko badhaava dene vaale hon
 Avoid toys that discourage children from using imagination
 bacchon ko aise khilone den, jo jivan kii samasyaon se ubaarane main unke saamaajik, bhaavnaatmak or sangyanatmak kaushal ko viksit karen
 It is important that you select such toys, which motivate children to think and understand
 dhyaan rahe is tarah ke khilone bahut adhik mahange yaa trendi nahin hote
 Share such books and magazines with your children, which you too can read with them
 kuch khilone hinsa yaa jaateey yaa ling bhed ko badhaava dene vaale hote hai
 Keep your children away from such toys
 video or computer game kaa istemaal simit hona chahie
 The total screen time of children per day, including watching TV and computer, should not exceed 1 to 2 hours per day
 5 saal se chote bacchon ko tivi or video games kaa istemaal tabhi karne den jab vah unke liye vikasaatmak rup se upyukt hon
 Toys given to children should be such that they are not sharp and do not harm the children
 agar aapkaa baccha chota he to unhen aise khilone na den jinke chote-chote parts hon
 Your child may take these toys in the mouth, which may threaten his life
 adhiktar ajukational toy aise hote hai jo bacchon ko ek edlt ke saath bina kisi saport or condishan ke ghulana-milanaa sikhaate hai
 There should be no toy option to get parents attention
 bacchon ko aise surakshit, saste khilone upalbadh karaaen, jinka vikasaatmak upyog ho
 Children's toys should be those that promote learning and development in areas that encourage development and creativity
 un khilaunon se bachanaa chahie, jo kalpanaashakti kaa upyog karne se bacchon ko hatotsahit karte hai
 Give children toys that develop their social, emotional and cognitive skills in coping with life's problems
 yah jaruri he ki aap aise khilaunon kaa sillection karen, jo bacchon ko sochane or samajhane kii ore prerit karen
 Note that such toys are not very expensive or trendy
 apane bacchon ke saath aisi kitaaben or magazine share karen, jinhen aap bhi unke saath pard saken
 Some toys promote violence or racial or gender discrimination
 aise khilaunon se apane bacchon ko dur rakhen
 Use of video and computer games should be limited
 pratidin bacchon kaa kul screen time, jisamen tivi or computer dekhnaa bhi shaamil he pratidin 1 se 2 ghante se zyada nahin hona chahie
 Allow children under 5 years of age to use TV and video games only when they are developmentally appropriate for them
 bacchon ko die gaye khilone aise hone chahie jo nukile na ho or bacchon ko nuksaan na pahunchaa saken
 If your child is small, do not give them toys that have small parts
 aapkaa baccha in khilaunon ko munh main le saktaa he, jisase uski jaan ko khatra ho saktaa he
 The Supreme Court has closed the hearing on the plea to bring the Kohinoor diamond back from Britain
 court ne kaha ki ham centre ke jawaab se santusht hai ki sarkaar prayaas kar rahi he isliye is maamle main court ko aage sunwaayee kii jarurat nahin
 - How can we stop an auction happening in the UK or place such order to another country
 ham hairaan hai ki kis tarah kii yachikaayen daakhil kii jaati hai
 The court disposed of the petition saying
 sitambar 2016 ko centre ne supreme court main daakhil halafname main kaha he ki kohinoor hira bharat kaa he or ise east india company ne maharaja dilip singh se jab vah naaballig the, tab unase dhokhe se jabt kar liya tha
 Kohinoor of 105 carats was never presented as a gift to the Queen of Britain
 isse desh ke logon kii bhavanaaen judi hai
 India is exploring possibilities to bring Kohinoor back from Britain, as it is not legally possible
 haalanki bharat or britain donon UNESCO sandhi se bandhe hue hai, lekin kohinoor ke maamle main bharat antarrashtriya court nahin ja saktaa kyonki kohinoor ko sandhi se pehle hi bharat se le jaaya ja chukaa tha
 The comments yachika me kaha gaya he ki kohinoor ko maharaja dilip singh ne east india company ko gift nahin kiya tha balki unhen ise dene ke liye vivash kiya gaya tha

 kohinoor heere ko britain se waapas laane kii yachika par supreme court main sunwaayee hui
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had said that the Kohinoor case is serious, the central government should come to the court with any concrete suggestion on this issue
 bharat kohinoor ko britain se waapas laane ke liye sambhaavnaaen talash rahaa he kyonki kanoonee rup se yah sambhav nahin he
 Although both India and Britain are bound by the UNESCO treaty, India cannot go to the International Court of Justice in Kohinoor as Kohinoor had already been moved from India before the treaty

 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon ke tisare charan ke daur kaa matdaan chal rahaa he
 As voting is taking place, the heartbeat of the candidates is also increasing
 matadaataaon kii lahar kis taraf apana rukh mode le, kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa
 But one thing that seems clear in these elections is the danger of own seat to Shivpal Yadav
 shivpal singh jaswant nagar vidhansabha seat se paanchavin baar chunaav lard rahe hai
 In the battle of uncle-nephew in the state, the chair of uncle Shivpal should not be lost
 is baat kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pichley ek maheene se shivpal singh apni vidhansabha chhodkar kahin baahar nahin gaye hai
 Significantly, neither Shivpal has left the assembly nor has made any statement so far
 ve ekadam chuppi saadhe hue hai
 Yes, i can only say, 'I will speak after March 11
 ' Party sources say that Shivpal is afraid of going to his chair as Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav stand up against him
 unhen dar kisi vipakshi party se nahin balki apane khude ke parivaar se lag rahaa he
 Because Akhilesh Yadav has clearly stated during his rallies that his own people are engaged in harming the party and family
 guuruuvaar ko itawa main yojit ek raily main unhone kaha, ‘jinhone netaji or mere bich khai paidaa kii he, itawa ke log unhen sabak sikhaane kaa kaam karnaa

 pradesh main chachaa-bhattije kii ladaai main kahin chachaa shivpal kii kursi na chali jaae
 This can be gauged from the fact that Shivpal Singh has not left his Assembly for the last one month
 khasbaat yah ki na to shivapal vidhansabha chhodkar baahar gaye hai or na hi ab tak koi bayaan diya he
 They are keeping quiet
 haa, bas itnaa hi kehete nazar aate hai, '11 march ke baad boluungaa
 ' party sutara bataate hai ki akhilesh yadav or ramgopal yadav ke virodh main khadey ho jane ke kaaran shivpal ko apni kursi jane kaa dar sata rahaa he
 He is not afraid of any opposition party but of his own family
 kyonki akhilesh yadav reliyon ke dauraan saaf-saaf kah chuke hai ki apane log hi party or parivaar ko nuksaan pahunchane main lage hue hai
 At a rally held in Etawah on Thursday, he said, 'people of Etawah who have created a gap between Netaji and me, to teach them a lesson
 ’ akhilesh jaswant nagar main prachaar karne nahin aae
 Shivpal has no hope of getting along with his nephew, so he campaigned alone in the assembly

 upi board kii 10veen or 12veen kii pariksha dene vaale chaatr lambey samay se rigelt kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 The result will be released today

 There were 36,55,691 students in class 10 and 29,81,327 students in class 12
 vahiin is saal upi board pariksha main nakal rokane ke liye pukhta intjaam kiye gaye the
 Due to strict arrangements, about 11 lakh students left the exam in between
 aisa pehali baar hua he jab chaatro ne kisi pariksha ko itani badi sankhya main bich main chhod diya he
 According to the reports, more students are expected to fail this year
 ye hai UPSC civil pariksha ke 5 topper, ejiniers kaa rahaa dabadabaaie ek najar daalate hai upi board ke pichley saal ke rigelt par 
 
 upi board 2017 kii 10veen or 12veen pariksha main 60 lakh chaatro ne hissaa liya tha

 18 pratishat chaatr paas hue the, vahiin 12veen board pariksha main 82
 62 percent students passed
 pichley saal rigelt 9 june ko jari kiya gaya tha
 Why can students fail? This year the UP board examination showed a lot of toughness from the UP government
 jahaan upi board kii pariksha main nakal rokane ke liye rajya sarkaar ne 8549 pariksha kendron main sisitivi camere lagaae the saath hi nakal rokane ke liye 22 timen gathit kii gai thi
 At the same time, after installing CCTV cameras in the examination centers, about 11,27,815 students had left the exam in the middle, because of dropping the exam, it is being told that this time the number of students who pass can be reduced

 gauratlab he ki pichley saal uttar pradesh main chunaav ke kaaran parikshaayen der se shuru hui thim
 This is the reason why the result was delayed
 sankshipt bhaashan or ant main yah jumala, ''aapan maane khushi to, mu ve bahut khushi (aap log khush hai, main bhi bahut khush hum)
 Saying this, Naveen Patnaik's convoy would have moved forward
 patnayak paanchavi baar odisha ke mukhyamantri kii shapath lenge
 In this case, he has equaled the Chief Minister of Sikkim Pawan Kumar Chamling
 chamling 24 saal tak mukhyamantri ke pad par rah chuke hai, par is baar ve chunaav haar gaye
 At the same time, even though the Modi magic ran throughout the country in this election, it became ineffective by going to Odisha
 loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ne bhale 8 siten jeet leen, lekin vidhansabha chunaav main patnayak ne modi lahar ko roak diya
 Elections were held for 146 seats in a total of 147 seats, out of which 112 seats were won by Patnaik's party Biju Janata Dal (BJD)
 saal 2014 main bhi modi kii lahar ko patnayak beasar kar chuke hai
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had then got 10 seats in the Lok Sabha elections and one in the assembly elections
 odishavasiyon ko patnayak ke netritv par bharosa he jiskaa ve bhi bahut sammaan karte hai
 Perhaps this thing was also understood by the people of Odisha
 vidhansabha chunaav main unki svarnim jeet ke thik baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne unhen phone karke badhai di
 Patnaik says that he also congratulated Modi for the nda's success in the country
 patnayak centre se behatar rishte rakhane ke paksh main hai
 He said that his thinking is positive in the interest of Odisha
 aise main centre ke saath unke rishte achche rahane kii ummid he
 He avoided the question of bjd's role in national politics by calling it Wet and Watch
 patnayak saal 2000 se odisha ke mukhyamantri ke pad par hai
 Only the charismatic leader can do the way Patnaik transformed the country's poorest state
 modi pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee ke voton main sendhamari to kar gaye par odisha main unki ek nahin chali
 However, for this, after Modi became the Prime Minister, there are about 14 meetings in Odisha and BJP President Amit Shah has held 13 meetings
 kuch agsit pole surveykshanon ne odisha vidhansabha main bhaajapa kii 23 se 45 siten tak aane kii baat jaise hi kahi, bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh basant kumaar panda or kendriya mantri juel oram ne bayaan de daalaa ki odisha main abaki baar bhaajapa kii sarkaar banegi
 Not only this, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan as the face of the Chief Minister and Aparajita Mahanti, who won the Lok Sabha elections from Bhubaneswar, came up for discussion
 lekin jab rigelt aae to bhaajapa 23 siten hi hasil kar saki
 The bjp's dream of forming a government in the state proved to be similar to the dream of Mungerilal
 haalanki saal 2014 kaa chunaav jeetne ke baad aatmavishvaas se labarej naveen patnayak ko tab jhatka laga, jab farvari 2017 main jila parishad ke chunaav main bhaajapa kii siten 36 se badhkar 297 tak pahunch gayi
 At the same time, the BJD came down from 651 to 473 and Congress from 128 to 60
 usee badhat ko dekhte hue 15 april 2017 ko bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak bhubaneshwar main yojit kii gayi, jisamen narendra modi-amit shah samet bhaajapa ke saare diggaj maujuud the
 After this success, Patnaik became very active to stop the winds blowing towards the BJP
 sanghathan or sarkaar main pherbadal karke unhone daagi or vivaadit netaaon ko baahar kaa darwaja dikhaaya
 His right hand bearers like Baijayant Panda, Damodar Raut were also thrown out of the party
 jan kalyankari yojanaon or odisha ke vikaas kii pariyojnaon tathaa udyogikaran ke liye nivesh ke liye bhagdaud ke saath bijness conklev yojit kiye jane lage
 In fact, the BJP also wanted to take advantage of the desperate land of the Congress, but Patnaik's prudent politics did not allow this to happen
 unhone dal ke bheetar shadyantrkariyon or baahar virodhiyon kaa bhi datakar muqabla kiya
 This increased Patnaik's graph in Odisha
 yah chunaav vastav main do majboot chhaviyon vaale netaaon ke bich tha
 Modi on one side and Patnaik on the other
 is chunaav main jo kaam bade-bade kshatrap nahin kar paae, vah patnayak ne kar dikhaaya
 Although the BJP may have won 8 seats in the Lok Sabha elections, Patnaik did not let Modi and his party melt in the assembly elections
 bhaajapa ko vidhansabha main unhone 23 siton par hi roak diya
 In this way, Odisha emerged as a state where Modi magic did not work
 naveen ek baar phir ajey ke rup main ubhare
 Patnaik was also praised for his relief work during the recent Phani cyclone in Odisha
 odisha daure ke baad patnayak sarkaar kii aapadaa prabandhan ko lekar modi ne bhi kaaphi tarif kii
 The destruction of the Fani cyclone is still intact
 patnayak kii rajya sarkaar or modi kii centre sarkaar ko odisha ke punarnirmaan kii is chunauti se nipatane ke liye saamanjasy baithaana hoga
 Senior journalist Praful Das says that Patnaik, who stays away from publicity in the media, follows the principle of 'talk less and work more', so his speech is brief
 unke odissa gyaan par bhi sawaal uthaae jate rahe hai, par ve vichlit nahin hue
 It was not felt from anywhere that he could not understand Odia
 unki lokapriyata kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ve pehali baar pashchim odisha kii vidhansabha seat bijapur se bhi chunaav lade or jite
 Nine out of every ten people in his constituency said that he would vote for Patnaik in the assembly and Modi for the Lok Sabha
 aise main lagata he, odisha ke log vot to modi ko dena chaahate the, par patnayak vahaan ke jananaayak hai, aise main odisha kaa taj unako milanaa tay tha
 Patnaik visited all 30 districts before the election notification and then repeated it even after the election notification
 mahila aarakshan kii maang ke saath hi loksabhaa chunaav main tikat vitaran main 33 fisad aarakshan lagu karne kaa bhi unhen laabh mila
 That is why he has specially thanked the women
 bijd pravaktaa sasmit paatra kehete hai, ''unhone jeetne kii aadat daal di he
 The work of writing the new Odisha text is going on
 log un par bharosa karte hai, unke netritv main aasthaa rakhte hai
 “the fifth term of the work that his government has done in the state from 2000 to 2019 is probably a result of that
 ''odisha ke logon ko dhanyavad jinhone ek baar phir mujhamen or meri party bijd main bharosa jataayaa he
 i especially thank the women who came out in large numbers to vote for us
 ''naveen patnayak, mukhyamantri, odisha*** Sushil Kumar, one of the great Olympians of India, has the mind to win a medal at the Rio Olympic Games, but at the moment his goal is to win a gold medal at the upcoming Asian Games, which is surprisingly not a taste of success yet

 javaanon ko salaam karne kaa samay he
 We have broken the myth of 30 years

 It is time to think that the world only salutes strong leadership
 ye baaten kahin india today conklev main pahunche rail or kendriya mantri piyush goyal ne
 He was questioned by India Today news director Rahul Kanwal
 piyush goyal ne kaha ki yah sawaal bada nahin he ki hamane kitnon ko maaraa lekin itnaa tay he ki hamane elosi ko paar kiya or balakot main bam giraae
 We did a surgical strike after the Uri attack
 pulavama kii ghatana ke baad hamane air strike kii isse puure vishwa main sandesh gaya ki ham jhukne vaale nahin hai
 If someone kills one of us, we will kill 10
 rahul kanwal ke yah kehane par ki bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne bataaya tha ki 300 logon ko maaraa gaya phir kaha 400 logon ko maaraa gaya
 On this, Piyush Goyal said that only the people of the army or intelligence can tell this
 unheen ke input ke aadhaar par yah karrwai kii ja sakati he
 Pakistan is saying that no one was killed, the opposition is also asking the same question
 yah sawaal khadaa karnaa vipaksh or pakistan kaa samarthan karnaa he
 Piyush Goyal said that it is not the government of 2008
 jab mumbai hamalaa hua tha to us samay ke vayusena pramukh ne kaha tha ki hamen anumit nahin mili ham pakistan ke khilaaf air strike karne ke liye taiyaar the
 Goyal questioned why permission was not given at that time
 goyal ne kaha ki is sarkaar kii visheshta rahi he ki hamane jo kaha he vah puraa kiya he
 We perform but the media calls it Tom Talking
 jab unase poocha gaya ki aakhir aapaki sabase badi asafalataa kya he? is par goyal kaa kahana tha ki vah media ko samajha nahin paae yahi unki sabase badi asafalataa he

 cricket pandit or purv cricketer viraat kohli (virat Kohli) or ravi shastri (ravi Shastri) ko suzav de rahe hai ki team main kya sambhavitabadlaav hone chahien
 In such a situation, former cricketer and commentator Sanjay Manjrekar (sanjay Manjrekar) has chosen his XI for the third Test
 abhi test shuru hone se pehle or purv cricketer bhi apni-apni ilevan chunenge
 Sourav Ganguly has already suggested
 dekhne kii baat yah hogi ki captain viraat kohli or ravi shastri koun sa rasta chunate hai
 Why the tail wags against India

 com / wxzpbagwwtyaha to saaf he ki bhartiya management tisare test ke liye ilevan main badlaav karegaa, lekin ye badlaav kya honge, is bare main kuch bhi pakke taur par kah paanaa bahut hi mushkil he
 In the second Test played in Perth, India's team management proved to be a complete failure to read the pitch
 bhartiya team perth main bina spinner ke maidan par utari thi
 And India had to bear the brunt of it
 iske baad team or captain ko chautarafa aalochana jhelni padi thi
 Troubles with the team continued
 prithvi shaw, rohit sharma or aswin chotil hokar baahar ho gaye the
 Now the selectors have included Mayank Agarwal and Hardik Pandya in the squad for the rest of the matches
 lekin iske baavjood sateek ilevan kaa anumaan laga paanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Now that the team currently has three specialist openers, Sanjay has suggested that India should start the innings with Hanuma Vihari in Melbourne
 sanjay aisa isliye chaahate hai ki mayank agarwal ke liye turant hi australian halaat se khud ko dhaal paanaa khaasaa mushkil hoga, jabaki vihari ek test khel chuke hai
 To this, Manjrekar said that it would be necessary to field a new opener without match practice right in front of the Kookaburra ball
 vahiin, bharat kaa bhi ek lanbaa itihaas rahaa he ki kisi sheersh ballebaaj ne australia main apana pehla test nahin khelaa he
 He said that if this Test were to be held in India, then Mayank had no problem in landing it directly
 lekin australia main unhen bina match practice ke utaarna jokhim bharaa ho saktaa he
 By the way, Rohit Sharma's selection in Sanjay's XI is a bit surprising
 perth main rohit kaa vanade ravaiya chaunkaane vaala rahaa tha! saath hi, unke out hone kaa tarika bhi
 However, know what is Sanjay Manjrekar's Final XI for Melbourne Test

 Now it will be a little less to say that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Vriha Sangh Parivar, which has been spearheading the Ram Temple movement for the last 30 years, are extremely happy with the Supreme Court's decision in the Ayodhya temple case
 lekin ullas ke bich pehle hi is baat ko lekar takaraar kii khabaren aane lagi hai ki court ne mandir banane ke liye jo trust banane kaa aadesh diya he, uskaa hissaa koun-koun log honge
 In fact, the decision had not even fully landed in the minds of the people that the rumor had started on the issue of trust
 ram janmabhumi nyaas ke pramukh mahant nrity gopal das ne kah diya ki kisi or trust kii jarurat hi nahin he ki kyonki is nyaas kaa gathan keval ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye hua tha
 However, Mahant Dinendra Das of Nirmohi Akhara (whose claim to the right of Shaibayat has been rejected by the Supreme Court in the judgment), who claimed ownership over Ramlala, has opposed the trust and said that it should become part of the new trust 
 isliye philhal asamanjas kii sthiti he kyonki supreme court ke aadesh main yah bhi he ki nae trust main nirmohi akhaade kaa pratinidhitiv hoga, lihaaza vahi philhal is trust kaa ekmaatr pusht sadsy he
 The VHP has already clarified some things in the informal talks on the construction of the temple, on which it will not compromise
 pehali, mandir banane ke liye dhan logon se aayega, sarkaar se nahin
 Also, the bricks collected during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement of the 1990s will be used in the foundation of the temple and the map of the main temple will remain the same as that of Gujarati architect Chandrakant Sompura (whose grandfather designed the Somnath temple) Has envisaged
 chalis fisad kaam pattharon ko gande ke rup main ho chukaa he or iskaa istemaal mandir main kiya jayega
 Then the lion gate of the temple will be constructed at the same place where the foundation stone for the temple was laid in 1989, the first brick of which was laid by the hands of Kameshwar Chaupal, a Dalit Karsevak under the Sangh Parivar's Greater Hindu Inclusion Scheme
 vihip ke rashtriya sanyukt mahasachiv surendra jain kehete hai, ''trust main un logon kaa pratinidhitiv hona chahie jo mandir ke nirmaan abhiyaan ke liye date rahe, jinke paas is baat kii pariklpana thi ki mandir kaa nirmaan va sanchaalan kaise hoga or saath main samaaj ke sammanit log hone chahie
 We hope that the government will provide every desired freedom to the trust
 ''kayaas ab is baat ko lekar lagaae ja rahe hai trust kitna bada hoga or (nirmohi akhaade ke alaava) usamen koun-koun shaamil honge
 a source in the central government said, "the government has not yet considered how the trust will be formed
" vah jald hi is bare main faisla karegi or isamen sabhi sambhddha pakshon kii sahmati lee jaaegi
 Most of the people associated with the movement are also expecting the government to place at least one representative of the prominent saints who fought for the temple and are no longer in this world
 inamen ayodhya ke digambar akhaade va ramajnmabhumi nyaas ke pramukh rahe paramhans ramchandra das, gorakhpur ke gorakshpith ke mahant avaidhyanath (peeth ke maujuuda mahant or uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke guru), jagadguru ramchandra acharya or swami vamdev shaamil hai
 Mahant Nritya Gopal Das and Yugapurusha Paramanandji Maharaj are also expected to remain in the trust
 vihip ke sanyukt mahasachiv swami vigyanand kaa kahana tha, ''trust ko swytt, paardarshee or vastav main sabakaa pratinidhi hona chahie
 However, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is not very confident about this statement
 naam jaahir na karne kii shart par aresas ke ek varisht padaadhikari kaa kahana tha, ''yah jaruri nahin he ki mandir ke liye sangharsh karne vaale saare log trust main hon
 The trust needs planners and implementers and many of these saints may not be suitable for this task
 haalanki, is bare main antim faisla sarkaar ko karnaa he, jise trust ke gathan kii jimmedaari di gai he
 We have not yet talked to the government about this
 ''sarvocch nyaayalay ke faisle kii vyaakhyasarvocch nyaayalay ne apane faisle main kaha ki mandir kaa nirmaan sarkaar kii nigaraanee main ek trust ke jariye kiya janaa chahie
 Some legal experts also believe that since provisions 6 and 7 of the Ayodhya Acquisition Act 1993, the then Prime Minister P
W
 ve
 Narasimha Rao government 67 in and around the disputed site in Ayodhya
 7 acre jameen kaa adhigrahan kiya tha, isliye usase maujuuda sarkaar ko yah adhikaar bhi mil jaataa he ki vah mandir ke nirmaan ke kaam ko nayaa trust banane kii jagah kisi maujuuda trust ko hi saunp de
 In fact, the Supreme Court, relying on these provisions, has directed the government to prepare a plan for the construction of a Ram temple in three months by constituting a trust or a suitable institution under section 6 of this law
 vihip ke kaaryakari adhyaksh alok kumaar kaa kahana tha, ''main maanata hum ki yah kaam kisi maujuuda trust ko saunpa ja saktaa he
 But my interpretation of this is purely as a lawyer, not as a VHP leader
 agar main sahi hum to yah trust ram janmabhumi nyaas bhi ho saktaa he jisane abhi tak mandir ke liye pattharon ko taraashne kaa kaam kiya he
 "the important thing is that the VHP also wants BJP President Amit Shah to be a member of the trust because in his view he is a person uniting different forces of Hindutva
" vihip ke ek netaa kaa kahana tha, ''amit bhai vah dhuree hai jo sab pakshon ko apane saath le lenge
 Sources say that the government itself is considering this
 trust ke saamne ek mukhya kaam yah bhi hoga ki kaise 1993 main adhigrahit kii gai 67
 7 acres of land to be used
 mandir ke mul shilpkaar sompura jaise logon ko ummid he ki mukhya mandir main koi nayaa aayam nahin joda jayega
 They believe that even a slight change in the design will render the stonework done so far useless
 sompura kehete hai, ''sarkaar ko aisa na karne kii samajhadaari dikhaani chahie
 "he felt quite disenchanted with the slow pace of work on this project over the years
 babari masjid ke dhahaane ke turant baad 350 karigar kaam par lag gaye the, lekin pichley kuch varshon se mahaj saat karigar vahaan pathar kaa kaam kar rahe the
 The Trust collected around eight crore rupees for the project in the early years of the 1990s, most of which were small even in the fraction of 1 and 2 rupees
 lekin baad ke varshon main dhan kii aavak kam hoti chali gai
 According to the design so far, the main structure will be 270 feet long, 145 feet wide and 141 feet high
 yah un kuch durlabh mandiron main se ek hoga jinka ashtakoniya garbhagrih hoga
 Sompura model also has scope for various activities such as hospital, Sant Niketan, Katha Kunj, eatery and philosopher and research center
 sompura ke anusaar, yahi vah kshetra he jisamen trust nai praudyogiki kaa istemaal karke usamen badlaav va use pronnat kar saktaa he
 The temple craftsman believes that the picture of the future is still blurred because "instead of handing over the work to the trust, the work of setting up a new trust is being done
" ''uttar pradesh sarkaar ne ek anukool faisle kii ummid main nagari main baaki kaam kii shuruyaat pehle hi kar di thi
 a 251-foot-high statue of Ram on the banks of the Saryu River at a cost of Rs 250 crore, development of a new Ayodhya city and an airport has already been approved at a cost of Rs 500 crore
 sarkaar ko yah bhi ummid he ki ab ayodhya main yatriyon kii sankhya main bhi teji se ijapha hoga
 As far as the kashi-mathura issue, there is the issue of the movements of the temples of Kashi and Mathura, the union leaders have kept silence about them
 lekin is baat main koi andeh nahin ki ve ayodhya maamle main is jeet kaa istemaal aage majbootee hasil karne main karenge
 Alok Kumar said, "at this time all our attention is focused on Ayodhya and by taking up the remaining issues, we would not like to divert attention from the main issue
" ''aisa karne kii vajahen bhi hai
 As part of the larger strategy of the Sangh Parivar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sangh Chief Mohan Bhagwat have reportedly agreed that no person in the family will take up the affairs of Kashi and Mathura at present
 is bare main ek sakht nirdesh sangh ke sabhi sambhddha sanghathanon ko bhej diya gaya he
 One reason for this is that the Supreme Court has made it clear that pursuant to the Place of Worship (special Provisions) Act 1991, no other issue of any place of worship will be raised in future
 yah kanoon puja ke kisi bhi sthaan kii aazaadee ke vakt kii haisiyat main kisi bhi badlaav ko pratibandhit karata he
 But the voices causing problems from within the VHP are already heard
 kuch netaa yah kehane lage hai ki agar supreme court ke aadesh se hasil paanch acre jameen par koi masjid banati bhi he to kisi musalmaan aakrantha ke naam par nahin balki samudaay ke kisi samaveshi sadsy jaise paramveer chakra vijeta hawaldaar abdul hamid yaa purv raashtrapati e

 is bich, agar sthiti anukool rahati he to mandir ko teen-chaar saal main taiyaar ho janaa chahie, yani ain 2024 ke aam chunaavon se pehle or modi sarkaar use bada chunavi mudda banane ko tatpar rahegi
 According to Sompura, the stone work is 40 percent and it can be used immediately after the foundation is laid
 baat saaf he, is samay thodi-bahut mushkilen ain to bhi ayodhya main ram mandir 2024 tak hakeekat banakar taiyaar ho jayega
 The Chattisgarh has made it clear that it will not compromise on some things like money will be received from the people for building the temple, money will not be taken from the government
 The stone is ready
