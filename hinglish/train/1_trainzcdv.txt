 algaavaadi sanghathan hurriyat ke mudde par pakistan ke saath videsh sachiv str kii vaarta radd kar pradhanmantri narendra modi ne samvaad phir shuru karne kii shart badha di he
 It simply means that the dialogue process will start only when Pakistan stops talks with separatists in India
 rajnatik asantosh se jujh rahe pakistan ke liye yah kaam mushkil hoga
 Especially Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is in trouble
 bharat kii ore shanti kaa haath badhaane par unhen kaaphi virodh jhelana pad rahaa he
 This includes Modi's compromising stance during his visit to India to take oath
 agar sharif kii rajnatik jameen sikud rahi he to modi ke saamne bhi vikalp simit hai
 After deciding the stance in Hurriyat's case, the only credible solution before the government is to completely change the power equation between the two countries
 aisa badlaav laayaa jaae jo pakistan ko bharat kii pradhanta sweekaar karne par majaboor kar de
 For this, India will have to quickly take initiative on two fronts
 badi takaton ko saath lenaa hoga or aas-pados main anya deshon ko lubhaana hoga
 In practical terms, India will have to talk to Japan, China and the US which is due next month
 is baatcheet ke nattejey buniyadi ranneetik badlaav kaa sanket de sakate hai
 There may be nuclear and defense agreements with Japan, the direction of economic cooperation with China may change and some bold steps can be taken to arouse relations with the US
 aas-pados main bada ranneetik sandesh, khaas taur par bangladesh, nepal or srilanka main bharat virdohi bhaawanaaon ko shant karne kaa hoga
 There is some scope here
 modi ne nepal main acchhee shuruyaat kii he, 1950 kii sandhi par dobaaraa kaam karne kii ichha kaa bhi sanket diya he, lekin ise aage badhanaa hoga
 They can bring about a change in mood in Bangladesh by silencing opposition within the BJP on the ground border agreement and getting it approved by Parliament
 isi tarah srilanka ke saath paryaton or buniyadi dhaanche jaise muddon par aarthik samvaad kendrit kar nai shuruyaat kii ja sakati he
 After all this success, the Modi government can deliver a strong strategic message of dominance in the region and the height of the world stage, which will definitely add weight to dealings with Pakistan
 iske vipareet pakistan ke saath gatirodh khaskar america or china jaisi badi takaton ke kaan khadey kar degaa jo pakistan ke ahm saathi hai
 Another problem is that there is an atmosphere of instability, confrontation and insecurity within Pakistan, so dealing with it has become more complicated
 isi vajah se har baar vaarta radd karne ke baad bharat ko hameshaa hi neeche aane kaa rasta talashna padataa he kyonki sampark tode rakhane kaa ulataa asar adhik hota he
 However, the challenge is clear in front of Modi
 unhen is faisle se ranneetik laabh uthaanaa hoga varanaa palatwaar nuksaan de saktaa he

 dilachasp yah he ki samsung ne pehali baar selfi ke liye do front camaron kaa istemaal kiya he
 According to the company, these smartphones have features of flagship smartphones such as dual cameras and live focus
 philhal ise bharat main nahin launch kiya gaya he or company ne abhi saaf bhi nahin kiya he ki ise bharat main kab launch kiya jayega

 party ne guuruuvaar der raat khandu ke saath party ke 6 anya netaaon ko suspend kar diya tha
 According to sources, the PPA leadership was angry at the increasing influence of the Bharatiya Janata Party on Pema Khandu and this was the reason for his suspension
 party adhyaksh ne kahfa bengiya ne siem pema khandu ke alaava dipti siem chowna main ke alaava jin vidhayakon ko suspend kiya, unamem jembi tashi (lumala seat), pasang dorji sona (mechuka), chov teva main (chokhaam), jingnu naamchom (namsai) or kaamlung mosang (miao) shaamil the
 PPA President Bengia cited anti-party activities for this action
 bengiya ne kaha tha ki pehali najar main in sabooton se vah santusht hai ki ye log party virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil hai
 The PPA had a total of 43 mlas in the state including the assembly speaker and is part of the North East Democratic Alliance here
 arunachal main bijepike 11 vidhayak bhi rajya sarkaar kaa hissaa the
 However, after this break, only 11 mlas are left with the PPA

 In the hope of being elected as Lok Sabha Speaker, senior BJP leaders can be surprised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 bhaajapa sansadeey dal kii baithak main unhone jis tarah se gunvattta, nipunata or tatparta par sabase adhik focus karne kaa mantra saansadon ko diya he usase saaf he ki sirf varishthata hi jimmedaari saunpane kaa ekmaatr paimaana pradhanmantri ke liye nahin he
 In such a situation, BJP leaders who are considering themselves worthy of becoming the Lok Sabha Speaker on the basis of their seniority, may feel disappointed
 loksabhaa kaa nayaa adhyaksh 19 taarikh tak chunaa janaa he
 Among senior BJP leaders are senior leaders like Maneka Gandhi, Radha Mohan Singh, Virendra Kumar (protem Speaker), Pankaj Chaudhary, Mansukh Bhai Vasava, Anant Hegde, whose names are being discussed in the party as Lok Sabha Speaker on the basis of seniority
 
 bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he ki nishchit rup se ye sabhi varisht saansad hai or sansadeey kaary kaa inhen kaaphi anubhav bhi he
 But there are many leaders who may not have merit on the basis of seniority but they have good knowledge of parliamentary rules, rules, traditions
 kuch aise netaa hai jo loksabhaa ke liye pehali yaa duusari baar chune gaye hai lekin rajyasabha main vah pehle rahe hai
 BJP sources say that in fact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Home Minister and BJP President Amit Shah would be interested in making someone who can conduct the proceedings of the House properly
 adhyaksh kaa vyaktitv aisa ho ki uske nishpakshta ko lekar andeh na ho or jiskaa sabhi dal ke log sammaan karte hon
 The first attempt of Modi and Shah will be that maximum work can be done in the House and least disturbance should be done in the House
 aise main modi shaayad aise vyakti par bharosa kar sakate hai jo in paimaanon par khara utarataa ho

 BJP MP Vijay Goyal along with RWA members said in a press conference that Arvind Kejriwal has announced to waive the bill in different categories
 philhal mere saath kai RWA hai jo eemaandaaree se bill bharne kii baat kar rahe hai
 It seems that Kejriwal government is encouraging those who do not pay the bills
 aage goyal ne aam aadmi party sarkaar se sawaal poochhate hue kaha ki chunaav main mahaj kuch maheene bache hai
 After all, in the last 4 years, Arvind Kejriwal did not announce free schemes
 hamaari maang he ki mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal jal board par ek 'white paper' lekar aaen
 Goyal accused the government of saying that out of 21 lakh meters in Delhi, 7 lakh meters are bad due to heavy bills, and this benefits the government

 The Chief Minister of Delhi blew the meter once, today i blow the meter

 On her comparison with Lata Mangeshkar, she said that she does not become equivalent to that great singer
 ek jamaane main lata ko overtek karne ke sawaal par anuraadhaa ne kaha, lata mangeshkar lijend hai
 a lot of hard work has to be done for this
 samjhaute karne padate hai
 Lata ji is an institution
 unhone iske liye bahut mehnat kii
 i cannot be compared to them
 maine unheen kaa gaanaa sunakar riyaj kiya
 i am lucky that i was born during a singer like Lata ji and got a chance to sing with him
 ghar main tepe kar bheja tha shloke, filmon main aise mila tha anuraadhaa ko brellenuradhaa ne kaha, 90 ke daur main unhen kai gayakon ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka mila, lekin kumaar sanu or udit narayan ke saath zyada gane gaae
 Each film consisted of 10-10 songs, so there was a lot of work in that period
 anuraadhaa ne kaha, 'acchhee baat thi ki tii-series kaa bombai main studiyon tha, jahaan hamane saare gane record kiye
 Work started at 8 am
 jo dopaher tak chalata tha
 It used to happen many times that we had to record 20 songs
 unhone kaha, wo daur aaj kii tarah nahin tha jab kabhi-kabhaar ek-do gane kaa mauka miltaa tha
 On the short career of singers in the current phase, Anuradha said, 'I cannot blame singers for this
 kyonki unhen jo diya jayega vahi gaayenge
 In our era there were no reality shows where 10-15 singers used to come in a year
 hamaare jamaane main jitna vakt mukaam par pahunchane main lagata tha, utana hi vahaan bane rahane main
 But a lot of responsibility also lies with those who listen
 aaj zyaadaatar gaanaa gaaya nahin jaataa, 'bolaa' ja rahaa he
 Millions meet for this
 log kehete bhi hai ki unka ek 'bolaa' hua gaanaa popular hua he
 Those who came suddenly and disappeared, if they had worked hard, they would have lived today
 ye sunanaa bura lagata he, jab log kehete hai ki phalane ne unhen fail kar diya yaa peeche chhod diya
 'why didn't Vidya get films with Trio Khan? Telling the truth today, not Gulshan Kumar, thanking people for their singing, Anuradha said, 'with the blessings of the people, i got a place in crores of hearts
 iske liye khaastaur se gulshan kumaar ji or tii series ko shukriya dena chaahuungi
 Anuradha said, 'such was the phase in the 90s when romantic films started being made
 tab ek film main 10 gane hote the
 Because of this i got a lot of opportunity to sing
 ye daur bhi meri pahchaan banane ke liye mahatvapurn sabit hua
 Said- 'if a singer occasionally gets one or two songs, as it is nowadays- it is very difficult to survive in such an environment
 us jamaane main ek film main 10 gane hote hai or sabhi ke sabhi lokapriy ho jate the
 Anuradha said, the music suffered a big loss after the death of Gulshan Kumar
 moti mere liye gaali nahin, lekin kisi ko mere par coment karne kaa haq nahin: vidya balangulashan kii maut ke baad badal gaye halanuradhaa ne kaha, gulshan kumaar kii hatya bade sadame se kam nahin he
 If we look deeply, the music has weakened after his departure
 vah ek aisa aadmi the, jo bina kisi swaarth ke dil se lagakar sangeet or kalakaaron ko pahchaan dene kaa kaam kar rahe the
 Today Singer is leaving his identity and doing different things

 First the Finance Minister termed the dispute as baseless and now the Prime Minister's Office itself, using the tweet, has dismissed the allegations on the Finance Commission as false
 is twit ke jariye pradhanmantri ne bharosa dilaayaa he ki vitt ayog ke terms of reference main koi gadabadi nahin he or na hi iske jariye kisi rajya vishesh athwa kshetra ko kendriya rajasav aavanton main koi nuksaan hoga
 The Prime Minister even claimed that the new Finance Commission has been asked to give preference in revenue to those states which have succeeded in curbing the growing population
 iskaa sidhaa phayda tamilnadu jaise rajyon ko pahonchega jisane jansankhya par lagaam lagane main ahm badhat hasil kii he
 The Finance Commission does this by allocating revenue to the states
 The Central Government distributes a large part of its revenue to the states, so that the states which do not have sufficient resources to create a minimum standard of living can do this work with the Central Revenue
 lihaaja kendra sarkaar ke rajasav kaa yah bantwaaraa karne ke liye kendra sarkaar har 5wein varsh vitt ayog kaa gathan karti he
 The Finance Commission assesses the need of states for this sharing and uses several criteria for accurate assessment
 inamen rajya kii jansankhya or rajya kii kamai do ahm kasautiyaan hai
 While the need of the state is determined by the population, the poverty of the state is calculated from the state's GDP
 in donon kasautiyon ke aadhaar par zyada garibi or adhik jansankhya vaale rajyon ko zyada se zyada sansaadhan dene kii koshish kii jaati he jisase vah rajya shiksha, swasthya or anya sevaaon ko apane naagariyon tak pahunchaa sake
 Read this: Andhra Pradesh will be given a special package, not a special status: What is Jaitleyik's dispute? It is noteworthy that in the Terms of Reference of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, there was no instruction to use the population data
 iske baavjood rajyon kii jaruraton kaa sateek aankalan karne ke liye 14 ayog ne 2011 kii janaganana ke aankadon kaa istemaal kiya or uski tulana 1971 kii janaganana ke aankadon se kii
 On the basis of the result, the 14 Commission has allocated 42 percent of the central revenue to the states, giving a weightage of 10 percent to the 2011 population
 yah purv main rajyon ko aavantit sabase adhik rajasav tha
 Now in the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission, the Central Government has given a new directive that in order to allocate revenue to the states, also take note of such states which have taken good initiative in curbing the population
 sarkaar ne aise rajyon ko is kaam ke liye adhik aavanton kaa nirdesh diya he jisase baaki rajyon ko bhi jansankhya par lagaam lagane ke liye protsaahit kiya ja sake
 Now raising objection to the instructions given to the 15 Commission, former Finance Minister p Chindambaram claimed that the current Central Government has asked the new Finance Commission not to use the 1971 census data
 iske chalate chidambaram kii daleel he ki dakshin ke rajyon ko kendriya rajasav se kam paisa milegaa jabaki jansankhya ko lagaam lagane kii disha main usne lagaataar acha kaam kiya he
 However, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has clarified on his blog that in the 15th Finance Commission's Terms of Reference, the right balance has been drawn between the 'needs' and 'progress made in overcoming the population'
 
 15wein vitt ayog ke terms of reference main aisa koi pakshpaat yaa nirdesh nahin he jiske bare main yah kaha ja sake ki uske jariye jansankhya kii badhwaar par kaabo karne ke lihaaj se behatar pragati karne vaale rajyon ke saath bhedbhaav kiya gaya he

 tamilnadu police ne ek yuvak ko soshal netwarking site par ek photo post karne ke baad hiraasat main le liya he

 “samvidhan kii dhara 356 tab lagu kii jaati he jab raashtrapati is baat se santusht ho jaaen ki kisi rajya main samvidhan ke anusaar shashan nahin kiya ja saktaa or yah vishwaas karne ke paryaapt aadhaar he” This is the first line of a blog written by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in support of the decision to impose President's rule in Uttarakhand
 agar raashtrapati kii santushti hi vishwaas karne kaa paryaapt aadhaar he to is hisaab se ateet ke tamaam raashtrapati shashan par vishwaas kar lenaa chahie or unhen sanvaidhanik ghoshit kar dena chahie
 Is the Finance Minister ready to put so much trust in the President in the case of President's rule
 unki raay aaj kii he yaa hameshaa se rahi he
 Is this a new constitutional and political scale about President's rule? Then, in the scale the Supreme Court has set in the SR Bommai case, whether this scale is considered final so that His Majesty is satisfied then it means that everything is fine
 dastavezi sakshya hai ki 35 sadasyon ne vidhansabha ke pehle or us samay matvibhaajan kii maang kii thi, lekin iske baavjood viniyog vidheyak matdaan ke bagair paarit hone kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 There is ample evidence that the Appropriation Bill actually fell into the division of votes
 dhyaan dene vaali baat he ki aaj kii taarikh (28 march 2016) tak na to mukhyamantri or na hi vidhansabha ke adhyaksh ne viniyog vidheyak kii pramanit prati rajyapal ke paas bheji he
 It is therefore natural that the Appropriation Bill did not get the approval of the Governor
 is tarah viniyog vidheyak par kathith charchaa or uske paarit hone sambandhi sabhi tathy saaf taur par iske paarit na hone kii ore ishaara karte hai
 There is serious apprehension about the Appropriation Bill
 aaj kii taarikh main vidhansabha adhyaksh dwaara pramanit or rajyapal kii manzuri praapt viniyog vidheyak nahin he
 From the blog of the Finance Minister, we have taken these few lines and put them in a place which is related to the passing or not of the Appropriation Bill
 vitt mantri ye spasht nahin kar rahe hai ki mat vibhaajan hua tha yaa nahin
 If it had happened then with whose permission
 spikar to yahi kah rahe hai mat vibhaajan kii anumati nahin di gai thi
 When the speaker does not give permission, can the member split the vote by himself or does the member ask for a split, then there is no need for the speaker's permission or disagreement
 kya aisa spikar ke adhikaar ko lekar aisi koi parampara he yaa niyam he? To find out the rights of the speaker on the division of votes, we looked at the book by MN Kaul and Shakdhar's very thick book of practice and procedure of parliament
 anuchhed, kanoon kii vyakhya kii hamaari kshamta nahin he phir bhi bade logon ke kaam main nuskh nikaalane ke saahas kaa apana hi anand he
 You too can enjoy these questions without drawing any conclusions because maybe our questions are childish
 baharhaal is pustak ke pej 174 par likhaa he ki divizan kii anumati nahin dene ke bare main spikar ke visheshadhikaar : “the member may request the speaker to record his name without challenging the speaker’s decision on the voice vote
 spikar chaahe to anurodh sweekaar kar saktaa he agar use lage ki maamla mahatvapurn he or house main iske paksh main aam raay he
 '' is paragraph ko padhate hue kahin nahin lagata he ki spikar baadhya hi he
 If he wants, he can accept the request
 jaise loksabhaa or rajyasabha main kai sadasyon ne is baat kaa virodh kiya ki aadhaar bill mani bill ke rup main kaise pesh ho saktaa he
 But everyone had to accept the speaker's final decision
 yahaan bhi pej 174 main likhaa he ki spikar anurodh sweekaar kar saktaa he agar house main iske paksh main aam raay ho
 There is equality in the authority of the Speaker of Parliament and the Legislative Assembly
 spikar kah rahe hai dhwani mat se paas hua, virdohi kah rahe hai matvibhaajan se paas hua or yah bhi kah rahe hai ki matvibhaajan hua hi nahin
 i cannot say with certainty whether the final point has been stated about the division of votes
 ho saktaa he is maamle ko samajhane main hamaari hi koi kami ho! Now the role of the speaker is questioned here
 niyam se bhale hi wo baadhya nahin hai or na chunauti di ja sakati he lekin kya spikar ne sadan main aam raay kii andekhi kii
 From the allegations and the claims made at the Raj Bhavan, it seems that the speaker ignored the consensus and did not accept the division of votes but his right to do so is final or that of the members
 agar sadasyon ko sweekaar nahin he to ise chunauti adaalat main di jaaegi yaa rajbhavan main? kya rajbhavan sadan se upar he? is maamle main jitani spikar kii bhoomika naitik rup se sandigdh lagati he utana hi andeh rajbhavan par bhi hota he
 Jaitley ji has raised a question that the certified copy of the appropriation bill was not sent to Raj Bhavan on March 28
 na to mukhyamantri ne bheji na spikar ne jabaki 18 march kaa hi maamla he
 Here the question arises that according to Jaitley ji, if appropriation bill is not passed then what is the justification for waiting for certified copy? If the speaker sends the certified copy by his signature, is the Raj Bhavan obliged to accept it? The Chief Minister claims that it was not sent on the 18th but the next day the certified copy was sent to Raj Bhavan
 vitt mantri kah rahe hai ki 28 taarikh tak pramanit prati nahin bheji gai
 Now it can be proved only by the facts that who is saying the right thing
 agar mukhyamantri ko lagata he ki pramanit prati bheji gai to unhen kore bayaan kii jagah pramaan pesh karnaa chahie tha
 Clarity is required in public on the facts related to the Appropriation Bill as it is claimed to have constitutional crisis with the absence or absence of it
 jo ki ek tarah se dikhataa bhi he ki congress ke 9 vidhayak bijepi ke saath chale gaye hai
 Now the question is whether a whip was issued while placing the Appropriation Bill
 agar wheep jari ho jaae to kya congress ke sadsy khilaaf matdaan kar sakate hai? wheep todane par kya in 9 vidhayakon ke kilaaf dal badal kaa maamla nahin banataa he
 Does BJP and Congress not take action against their members when this happens? congress ke vidhayakon kaa wheep kaa ulanghan kar bijepi ke paas janaa or bijepi ko gale lagaakar sweekaar kar lenaa kya yah sanvaidhanik rup se sahi he
 If you break the rules and go to a party, can you be morally and constitutionally correct? spikar ne in 9 sadasyon kii sadsyta radd kar di he
 Now what is their legal status is not clear because the assembly has been suspended
 ye 9 sadsy apane adhikaron kii maang ko lekar raashtrapati ke paas jaayenge yaa rajyapal ke paas yaa adaalat ke paas
 The final decision is yet to decide on their membership
 agar court ne sadsyta behaal kar di to bijepi ke liye yah badi naitik jeet hogi bhale hi ye 9 sadsy congress ke hai
 Leaders of very honest image like Harak Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand and Hemant Sharma in Assam went to the BJP for the sake of their parallel ambition, but in Assam, the BJP made its MP a candidate for the Chief Minister and in Uttarakhand he also said that the CM would be his party 
 apane kaaryakartaaon kaa sammaan karnaa koi bijepi se siikhe or dalbadaluon kaa acha istemaal karnaa bhi
 The BJP can at least get publicity on social media about honest leaders like Harak Singh Rawat that Rahul Gandhi refused to meet such honest leaders
 raashtrapati shashan kii raajnneeti congress sarkaron kii dein he
 The crimes of the Congress are proving to be a boon for the BJP
 jaise hi aap uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke faisle par sawaal uthaayenge soshal media par kuch log aapako congressi bataane aa jaayenge
 This means that if the Congress has committed the crime and does the BJP, then do not mention it otherwise you will become a Congressman! All this will go on
 harish ravat ko bhi kai sawaalon ke jawaab dene hai
 They also look quite honest in the sting! Comments sarkaar barkhaast karne ke liye sting kaa aadhaar bananaa kam haasyaaspad nahin he
 That too is an open sting that one party is breaking the law from another party and supporting the leaders who have changed the party
 zarur sting ko lekar naitik or kanoonee sawaal banataa he
 Rawat should resign on the basis of the sting, the central leadership of Congress should respond but the government should be dismissed on this basis, it is not constitutionally understood
 tab to trinmul congress ke kitne netaa saansad or mantri sting karte hue pakade gaye hai
 There too, the government can be sacked just as President's rule was imposed in Maharashtra in 2014, just before the elections
 sanvaidhanik sankat ke naam par sankat kaa jo nayaa samvidhan likhaa ja rahaa he, darasal wo itnaa bhi nayaa nahin he
 The cover of the book has changed, the rest of the material is the same
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke faisle ke samarthan main jo blog likhaa he uski ye pehali pankti he
 If the President's satisfaction is sufficient basis to believe, then according to this, all the President's rule of the past should be believed and declared as constitutional
 kya vitt mantri sabhi raashtrapati shashan ke cese main raashtrapati par itnaa vishwaas karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 His opinion is today or always has been
 raashtrapati shashan ko lekar kya yah nayaa sanvaidhanik or rajnatik paimaana he? to phir supreme court ne es aar bommai cese main jo paimaane tay kiye hai usamen kya is paimaane ko antim mana gaya he ki mahamahim ji santusht ho jaaen to iskaa matlab he ki sabakuch thik he
 There is documentary evidence that 35 members had demanded a split before and at the time of the assembly, but despite this the appropriation bill is claimed to have passed without voting

 It is to be noted that till date (28 March 2016) neither the Chief Minister nor the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly has sent a certified copy of the Appropriation Bill to the Governor
 isliye yah swaabhaavik he ki viniyog vidheyak ko rajyapal kii manzuri nahin mili
 In this way, the alleged discussion on the Appropriation Bill and all the facts related to its passage clearly point towards its passage
 viniyog vidheyak ke bare main gambhir ashanka he
 As on date, there is no appropriation bill certified by the Speaker and approved by the Governor
 vitt mantri ke blog se hamane ye chand panktiyaan uthaakar ek jagah rakh di hai jo viniyog vidheyak ke paas hone yaa na hone se sambandhit hai
 The Finance Minister is not making it clear whether the vote was split or not
 agar hua tha to kiski anumati se hua tha
 The speaker is saying this that the division of votes was not allowed
 jab spikar anumati na de to kya sadsy khud se mat vibhaajan kara sakate hai yaa sadsy mat vibhaajan kii maang kar den to spikar kii anumati yaa asahmati kii koi zarurat hi nahin rah jaati
 Is there any such tradition or rule regarding the authority of the speaker? hamane mat-vibhaajan par spikar ke adhikaar jaanane ke liye em en kaul kii kitaab or shakdhar kii bahut hi moti si kitaab practice and procedure of parliament ko palat kar dekha

 However, on page 174 of this book it is written that the Speaker's privileges about not allowing division: “vaais vot (dhwani mat) par spikar ke faisle ko bina chunauti die sadsy chaahe to spikar ko apana naam ricard karne ke liye anurodh kar saktaa he

 The Finance Minister is saying that the certified copy has not been sent till the 28th

 Which also shows that 9 Congress mlas have gone with the BJP
 ab sawaal ye he ki viniyog vidheyak rakhte samay koi wheep jari hua tha
 If the whip is issued, can Congress members vote against it? Does not a case of change of party against these 9 mlas become a matter of breaking the whip
 kya bijepi or congress aisa hone par apane sadasyon ke kilaaf karrwai nahin karti hai
 Is it constitutionally correct for Congress mlas to violate the whip and go to BJP and embrace BJP? aap niyam tod kar kisi dal main chale jaayen to kya aap naitik or sanvaidhanik rup se sahi ho sakate hai? The speaker has canceled the membership of these 9 members
 ab unki kanoonee sthiti kya he yah spasht nahin he kyonki vidhansabha to nilambit ho chuki he
 These 9 members will go to the President or to the Governor or to the court to demand their rights

 The politics of President's rule is the result of Congress governments
 congress ke gunaah bijepi ke liye vardaan sabit ho rahe hai
 As soon as you question the decision of imposing President's rule in Uttarakhand, some people will come to tell you Congress on social media
 iskaa matlab yah he ki jo gunaah congress ne kiye hai or vahi bijepi kare to uskaa zikr mat karo varna congressi ho jaaoge! ye sab chalata rahegaa
 Harish Rawat also has many questions to answer
 sting main ve bhi kaaphi eemaandaar dikh rahe hai!tippaniyan It is no less ridiculous to base the sting to sack the government
 wo bhi to ek khuleam sting he ki ek party duusari party se kanoon tod kar dal badal kar aae netaaon ko sahaara de rahi he
 There is definitely a moral and legal question about the sting
 sting ke aadhaar par ravat ko istipha dena chahie, congress ke kendriya netritv ko jawaab dena chahie lekin is aadhaar par sarkaar barkhaast kar di jaae ye baat sanvaidhanik rup se samaj nahin aati he
 Then how many Trinamool Congress leaders have been caught stinging mps and ministers
 vahaan bhi sarkaar barkhaast kii ja sakati he jaise 2014 main maharashtra main chunaav se thik pehle raashtrapati shashan laga diya gaya tha
 In the name of constitutional crisis, the new constitution of crisis is being written, in fact it is not so new
 kitaab kaa cover badla he baaki material vahi he
 From the blog of the Finance Minister, we have taken these few lines and put them in a place which is related to the passing or not of the Appropriation Bill
 vitt mantri ye spasht nahin kar rahe hai ki mat vibhaajan hua tha yaa nahin
 If it had happened then with whose permission
 spikar to yahi kah rahe hai mat vibhaajan kii anumati nahin di gai thi
 When the speaker does not give permission, can the member split the vote by himself or does the member ask for a split, then there is no need for the speaker's permission or disagreement
 kya aisa spikar ke adhikaar ko lekar aisi koi parampara he yaa niyam he? To find out the rights of the speaker on the division of votes, we looked at the book by MN Kaul and Shakdhar's very thick book of practice and procedure of parliament
 anuchhed, kanoon kii vyakhya kii hamaari kshamta nahin he phir bhi bade logon ke kaam main nuskh nikaalane ke saahas kaa apana hi anand he
 You too can enjoy these questions without drawing any conclusions because maybe our questions are childish
 baharhaal is pustak ke pej 174 par likhaa he ki divizan kii anumati nahin dene ke bare main spikar ke visheshadhikaar : “the member may request the speaker to record his name without challenging the speaker’s decision on the voice vote
 spikar chaahe to anurodh sweekaar kar saktaa he agar use lage ki maamla mahatvapurn he or house main iske paksh main aam raay he
 '' is paragraph ko padhate hue kahin nahin lagata he ki spikar baadhya hi he
 If he wants, he can accept the request
 jaise loksabhaa or rajyasabha main kai sadasyon ne is baat kaa virodh kiya ki aadhaar bill mani bill ke rup main kaise pesh ho saktaa he
 But everyone had to accept the speaker's final decision
 yahaan bhi pej 174 main likhaa he ki spikar anurodh sweekaar kar saktaa he agar house main iske paksh main aam raay ho
 There is equality in the authority of the Speaker of Parliament and the Legislative Assembly
 spikar kah rahe hai dhwani mat se paas hua, virdohi kah rahe hai matvibhaajan se paas hua or yah bhi kah rahe hai ki matvibhaajan hua hi nahin
 i cannot say with certainty whether the final point has been stated about the division of votes
 ho saktaa he is maamle ko samajhane main hamaari hi koi kami ho! Now the role of the speaker is questioned here
 niyam se bhale hi wo baadhya nahin hai or na chunauti di ja sakati he lekin kya spikar ne sadan main aam raay kii andekhi kii
 From the allegations and the claims made at the Raj Bhavan, it seems that the speaker ignored the consensus and did not accept the division of votes but his right to do so is final or that of the members
 agar sadasyon ko sweekaar nahin he to ise chunauti adaalat main di jaaegi yaa rajbhavan main? kya rajbhavan sadan se upar he? is maamle main jitani spikar kii bhoomika naitik rup se sandigdh lagati he utana hi andeh rajbhavan par bhi hota he
 Jaitley ji has raised a question that the certified copy of the appropriation bill was not sent to Raj Bhavan on March 28
 na to mukhyamantri ne bheji na spikar ne jabaki 18 march kaa hi maamla he
 Here the question arises that according to Jaitley ji, if appropriation bill is not passed then what is the justification for waiting for certified copy? If the speaker sends the certified copy by his signature, is the Raj Bhavan obliged to accept it? The Chief Minister claims that it was not sent on the 18th but the next day the certified copy was sent to Raj Bhavan
 vitt mantri kah rahe hai ki 28 taarikh tak pramanit prati nahin bheji gai
 Now it can be proved only by the facts that who is saying the right thing
 agar mukhyamantri ko lagata he ki pramanit prati bheji gai to unhen kore bayaan kii jagah pramaan pesh karnaa chahie tha
 Clarity is required in public on the facts related to the Appropriation Bill as it is claimed to have constitutional crisis with the absence or absence of it
 jo ki ek tarah se dikhataa bhi he ki congress ke 9 vidhayak bijepi ke saath chale gaye hai
 Now the question is whether a whip was issued while placing the Appropriation Bill
 agar wheep jari ho jaae to kya congress ke sadsy khilaaf matdaan kar sakate hai? wheep todane par kya in 9 vidhayakon ke kilaaf dal badal kaa maamla nahin banataa he
 Does BJP and Congress not take action against their members when this happens? congress ke vidhayakon kaa wheep kaa ulanghan kar bijepi ke paas janaa or bijepi ko gale lagaakar sweekaar kar lenaa kya yah sanvaidhanik rup se sahi he
 If you break the rules and go to a party, can you be morally and constitutionally correct? spikar ne in 9 sadasyon kii sadsyta radd kar di he
 Now what is their legal status is not clear because the assembly has been suspended
 ye 9 sadsy apane adhikaron kii maang ko lekar raashtrapati ke paas jaayenge yaa rajyapal ke paas yaa adaalat ke paas
 The final decision is yet to decide on their membership
 agar court ne sadsyta behaal kar di to bijepi ke liye yah badi naitik jeet hogi bhale hi ye 9 sadsy congress ke hai
 Leaders of very honest image like Harak Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand and Hemant Sharma in Assam went to the BJP for the sake of their parallel ambition, but in Assam, the BJP made its MP a candidate for the Chief Minister and in Uttarakhand he also said that the CM would be his party 
 apane kaaryakartaaon kaa sammaan karnaa koi bijepi se siikhe or dalbadaluon kaa acha istemaal karnaa bhi
 The BJP can at least get publicity on social media about honest leaders like Harak Singh Rawat that Rahul Gandhi refused to meet such honest leaders
 raashtrapati shashan kii raajnneeti congress sarkaron kii dein he
 The crimes of the Congress are proving to be a boon for the BJP
 jaise hi aap uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke faisle par sawaal uthaayenge soshal media par kuch log aapako congressi bataane aa jaayenge
 This means that if the Congress has committed the crime and does the BJP, then do not mention it otherwise you will become a Congressman! All this will go on
 harish ravat ko bhi kai sawaalon ke jawaab dene hai
 They also look quite honest in the sting! Comments sarkaar barkhaast karne ke liye sting kaa aadhaar bananaa kam haasyaaspad nahin he
 That too is an open sting that one party is breaking the law from another party and supporting the leaders who have changed the party
 zarur sting ko lekar naitik or kanoonee sawaal banataa he
 Rawat should resign on the basis of the sting, the central leadership of Congress should respond but the government should be dismissed on this basis, it is not constitutionally understood
 tab to trinmul congress ke kitne netaa saansad or mantri sting karte hue pakade gaye hai
 There too, the government can be sacked just as President's rule was imposed in Maharashtra in 2014, just before the elections
 sanvaidhanik sankat ke naam par sankat kaa jo nayaa samvidhan likhaa ja rahaa he, darasal wo itnaa bhi nayaa nahin he

 However, on page 174 of this book it is written that the Speaker's privileges about not allowing division: “vaais vot (dhwani mat) par spikar ke faisle ko bina chunauti die sadsy chaahe to spikar ko apana naam ricard karne ke liye anurodh kar saktaa he
 The Speaker may accept the request if he feels that the matter is important and there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 '' Nowhere does it seem that the speaker is bound while reading this paragraph
 wo chaahe to anurodh sweekaar kar saktaa he
 For example, many members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha opposed how the Aadhaar bill could be presented as a money bill
 magar sabko spikar kaa antim faisla sweekaar karnaa hi padaa
 Here also on page 174 it is written that the speaker can accept the request if there is a general opinion in its favor in the House
 sansad or vidhansabha ke spikar ke adhikaar main samanta hoti he
 The speakers are saying that they have passed by voice vote, the opponents are saying that they have passed with the vote and they are also saying that there was no voting
 main daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa ki mat vibhaajan ko lekar antim baat kah di gai he yaa nahin
 May be we are lacking in understanding this matter! ab yahaan spikar kii bhoomika par sawaal khadey hote hai
 Even though they are not bound by the rule and cannot be challenged, did the speaker ignore the general opinion in the House
 aaropon or rajbhavan main kiye gaye daavon se to yahi lagata he ki spikar ne aam raay kii andekhi kii or mat vibhaajan ko sweekaar nahin kiya lekin aisa karne kaa unka adhikaar antim he yaa sadasyon kaa
 If the members are not accepted, will it be challenged in the court or in the Raj Bhavan? Is Raj Bhavan above the House? In this case, as much as the role of the speaker seems to be morally doubtful, the doubt is also on the Raj Bhavan
 jetali ji ne ek sawaal uthaaya he ki 28 march kar viniyog vidheyak kii pramanit prati rajbhavan ko nahin bheji gai
 Neither the Chief Minister nor the Speaker sent it, whereas it is the matter of March 18 only
 yahaan yah sawaal uthta he ki jetali ji ke anusaar agar viniyog vidheyak paas hi nahin hua to pramanit prati ke intazaar kaa kya auchity rah jaataa he? pramanit prati to spikar hi apane dastakhat se bhejtaa he to kya use sweekaar karne ke liye rajbhavan baadhya he? mukhyamantri kaa daawa he ki 18 taarikh ko nahin bheji gai magar uske agle din pramanit prati rajbhavan bhej di gai
 The Finance Minister is saying that the certified copy has not been sent till the 28th
 ab ise to tathyon ke dwaara hi sabit kiya ja saktaa he ki koun sahi bol rahaa he
 If the Chief Minister feels that a certified copy has been sent, then he should have presented evidence instead of blank statement
 saarvajanik taur par viniyog vidheyak se jude tathyon par spashtataa zaruri he kyonki isi ke paas hone yaa na hone ko lekar sanvaidhanik sankat kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 Which also shows that 9 Congress mlas have gone with the BJP
 ab sawaal ye he ki viniyog vidheyak rakhte samay koi wheep jari hua tha
 If the whip is issued, can Congress members vote against it? Does not a case of change of party against these 9 mlas become a matter of breaking the whip
 kya bijepi or congress aisa hone par apane sadasyon ke kilaaf karrwai nahin karti hai
 Is it constitutionally correct for Congress mlas to violate the whip and go to BJP and embrace BJP? aap niyam tod kar kisi dal main chale jaayen to kya aap naitik or sanvaidhanik rup se sahi ho sakate hai? The speaker has canceled the membership of these 9 members
 ab unki kanoonee sthiti kya he yah spasht nahin he kyonki vidhansabha to nilambit ho chuki he
 These 9 members will go to the President or to the Governor or to the court to demand their rights
 inaki sadsyta ke faisle par abhi antim faisla baaki he
 If the court reinstates membership, it would be a big moral victory for the BJP even if these 9 members are from the Congress
 uttarakhand main harak singh ravat or assam main hemanth sharma jaise behad eemaandaar chhavi ke netaa bijepi ke paale main gaye to apni samanaantar mahatvakanksha kii khaatir lekin assam main bijepi ne apane saansad ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar banaaya or uttarkhand main bhi kah diya siem unki party kaa hoga
 One should learn from BJP to respect its workers and also make good use of defectors
 bijepi kam se kam harak singh ravat jaise eemaandaar netaaon ke bare main soshal media main prachaar to karvaa hi sakati he ki aise eemaandaar netaaon se rahul gandhi ne milane se inkaar kar diya
 The politics of President's rule is the result of Congress governments
 congress ke gunaah bijepi ke liye vardaan sabit ho rahe hai
 As soon as you question the decision of imposing President's rule in Uttarakhand, some people will come to tell you Congress on social media
 iskaa matlab yah he ki jo gunaah congress ne kiye hai or vahi bijepi kare to uskaa zikr mat karo varna congressi ho jaaoge! ye sab chalata rahegaa
 Harish Rawat also has many questions to answer
 sting main ve bhi kaaphi eemaandaar dikh rahe hai!tippaniyan It is no less ridiculous to base the sting to sack the government
 wo bhi to ek khuleam sting he ki ek party duusari party se kanoon tod kar dal badal kar aae netaaon ko sahaara de rahi he
 There is definitely a moral and legal question about the sting
 sting ke aadhaar par ravat ko istipha dena chahie, congress ke kendriya netritv ko jawaab dena chahie lekin is aadhaar par sarkaar barkhaast kar di jaae ye baat sanvaidhanik rup se samaj nahin aati he
 Then how many Trinamool Congress leaders have been caught stinging mps and ministers
 vahaan bhi sarkaar barkhaast kii ja sakati he jaise 2014 main maharashtra main chunaav se thik pehle raashtrapati shashan laga diya gaya tha
 In the name of constitutional crisis, the new constitution of crisis is being written, in fact it is not so new
 kitaab kaa cover badla he baaki material vahi he
 “the member may request the speaker to record his name without challenging the speaker’s decision on the voice vote
 spikar chaahe to anurodh sweekaar kar saktaa he agar use lage ki maamla mahatvapurn he or house main iske paksh main aam raay he
 '' is paragraph ko padhate hue kahin nahin lagata he ki spikar baadhya hi he
 If he wants, he can accept the request
 jaise loksabhaa or rajyasabha main kai sadasyon ne is baat kaa virodh kiya ki aadhaar bill mani bill ke rup main kaise pesh ho saktaa he
 But everyone had to accept the speaker's final decision
 yahaan bhi pej 174 main likhaa he ki spikar anurodh sweekaar kar saktaa he agar house main iske paksh main aam raay ho
 There is equality in the authority of the Speaker of Parliament and the Legislative Assembly
 spikar kah rahe hai dhwani mat se paas hua, virdohi kah rahe hai matvibhaajan se paas hua or yah bhi kah rahe hai ki matvibhaajan hua hi nahin
 i cannot say with certainty whether the final point has been stated about the division of votes
 ho saktaa he is maamle ko samajhane main hamaari hi koi kami ho! Now the role of the speaker is questioned here
 niyam se bhale hi wo baadhya nahin hai or na chunauti di ja sakati he lekin kya spikar ne sadan main aam raay kii andekhi kii
 From the allegations and the claims made at the Raj Bhavan, it seems that the speaker ignored the consensus and did not accept the division of votes but his right to do so is final or that of the members
 agar sadasyon ko sweekaar nahin he to ise chunauti adaalat main di jaaegi yaa rajbhavan main? kya rajbhavan sadan se upar he? is maamle main jitani spikar kii bhoomika naitik rup se sandigdh lagati he utana hi andeh rajbhavan par bhi hota he
 Jaitley ji has raised a question that the certified copy of the appropriation bill was not sent to Raj Bhavan on March 28
 na to mukhyamantri ne bheji na spikar ne jabaki 18 march kaa hi maamla he
 Here the question arises that according to Jaitley ji, if appropriation bill is not passed then what is the justification for waiting for certified copy? If the speaker sends the certified copy by his signature, is the Raj Bhavan obliged to accept it? The Chief Minister claims that it was not sent on the 18th but the next day the certified copy was sent to Raj Bhavan
 vitt mantri kah rahe hai ki 28 taarikh tak pramanit prati nahin bheji gai
 Now it can be proved only by the facts that who is saying the right thing
 agar mukhyamantri ko lagata he ki pramanit prati bheji gai to unhen kore bayaan kii jagah pramaan pesh karnaa chahie tha
 Clarity is required in public on the facts related to the Appropriation Bill as it is claimed to have constitutional crisis with the absence or absence of it
 jo ki ek tarah se dikhataa bhi he ki congress ke 9 vidhayak bijepi ke saath chale gaye hai
 Now the question is whether a whip was issued while placing the Appropriation Bill
 agar wheep jari ho jaae to kya congress ke sadsy khilaaf matdaan kar sakate hai? wheep todane par kya in 9 vidhayakon ke kilaaf dal badal kaa maamla nahin banataa he
 Does BJP and Congress not take action against their members when this happens? congress ke vidhayakon kaa wheep kaa ulanghan kar bijepi ke paas janaa or bijepi ko gale lagaakar sweekaar kar lenaa kya yah sanvaidhanik rup se sahi he
 If you break the rules and go to a party, can you be morally and constitutionally correct? spikar ne in 9 sadasyon kii sadsyta radd kar di he
 Now what is their legal status is not clear because the assembly has been suspended
 ye 9 sadsy apane adhikaron kii maang ko lekar raashtrapati ke paas jaayenge yaa rajyapal ke paas yaa adaalat ke paas
 The final decision is yet to decide on their membership
 agar court ne sadsyta behaal kar di to bijepi ke liye yah badi naitik jeet hogi bhale hi ye 9 sadsy congress ke hai
 Leaders of very honest image like Harak Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand and Hemant Sharma in Assam went to the BJP for the sake of their parallel ambition, but in Assam, the BJP made its MP a candidate for the Chief Minister and in Uttarakhand he also said that the CM would be his party 
 apane kaaryakartaaon kaa sammaan karnaa koi bijepi se siikhe or dalbadaluon kaa acha istemaal karnaa bhi
 The BJP can at least get publicity on social media about honest leaders like Harak Singh Rawat that Rahul Gandhi refused to meet such honest leaders
 raashtrapati shashan kii raajnneeti congress sarkaron kii dein he
 The crimes of the Congress are proving to be a boon for the BJP
 jaise hi aap uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke faisle par sawaal uthaayenge soshal media par kuch log aapako congressi bataane aa jaayenge
 This means that if the Congress has committed the crime and does the BJP, then do not mention it otherwise you will become a Congressman! All this will go on
 harish ravat ko bhi kai sawaalon ke jawaab dene hai
 They also look quite honest in the sting! Comments sarkaar barkhaast karne ke liye sting kaa aadhaar bananaa kam haasyaaspad nahin he
 That too is an open sting that one party is breaking the law from another party and supporting the leaders who have changed the party
 zarur sting ko lekar naitik or kanoonee sawaal banataa he
 Rawat should resign on the basis of the sting, the central leadership of Congress should respond but the government should be dismissed on this basis, it is not constitutionally understood
 tab to trinmul congress ke kitne netaa saansad or mantri sting karte hue pakade gaye hai
 There too, the government can be sacked just as President's rule was imposed in Maharashtra in 2014, just before the elections
 sanvaidhanik sankat ke naam par sankat kaa jo nayaa samvidhan likhaa ja rahaa he, darasal wo itnaa bhi nayaa nahin he

 Documents record that the Rajiv Gandhi government was not happy about Ronald Reagan sending envoys but he did not hesitate to meet the envoy

 Under whose leadership we won
 main adwani ji ke prastaav kaa anumodan karata hum
 i want to assure the country that the fate and future of this country will change under the leadership of Narendra Modi 
 narendra bhai ko bahut bahut safalataa kii shubhakamanaayen
 Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Kariya Munda, Gopinath Munde, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi 'I support the proposal by the venerable Advani in the name of Narendra Modi
 'rajnath singhchaur koi doosraa naam
 
 
 Honorable Advani ji proposed the name of Shri Narendra Modi as the leader of the Parliamentary Party
 kai varisht netaaon ne puure sansadeey dal samet uskaa samarthan kiya
 Modi: You did not raise your hands, Rajnath: No, i was watching
 sabhi ke haath tali bajaane main mashgool the
 Rajnath: i proclaim Shri Narendra Modi to be elected leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party Parliamentary Party
 rajnath singhmitron party kaa adhyaksh hone ke naate main prasann or romanchit hum
 In 1977, when the Janata Party was there, it also had a clear majority
 us samay kai raajnneetik partiyon ko milakar janata party bani thi
 And its formal announcement was made after the election
 uske baad 1989 main yah shrey jaataa he aadarneey atal ji or adwani ji, jinhone bharat kii raajnneeti ko do dhruviya banane kaa kaam kiya auki hamen us samay bhi acchhee safalataa praapt hui
 But no non-congress party could ever get a clear majority
 pehali baar aisa hua he
 Today we can all say with great pride
 aaj 2014 main 16veen loksabhaa ke parinaam aane ke baad ab bharat kii raajnneeti bhartiya janata party varses adars ho gai he
 It is a matter of pride for us
 ek raajnneetik vichaardhaara, ek darshanik avdharana lekar hamane apni raajnneetik yatra shuru kii thi
 i want to remember today the late Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the founder of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the late Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay
 jinhone ek swaavlambee swabhimani bharat kaa swapn dekha tha
 Advani and Atal ji shed sweat for this
 mujhe khushi he ki unke sapane ko agar kisi ke netritv main ham saakaar hote dekh rahe hai, vah aadarneey narendra bhai modi hai
 Whenever there have been political changes in this country
 tab janata kii itani badi bhagidaari nahin hui he
 In 2009, where the people of this country made about 7
 8 karod logon ne matdaan kiya tha
 This time votes ever polled 17
 16 karod ho gaya
 Most SC ST mps also belong to BJP
 itnaa hi nahin jin rajyon main bijepi kii upasthiti kamjor maani jaati thi odisha, west bengal, kerala, tamilnadu
 Our vote share has increased in such states
 anya kisi raajnneetik party kii main yahaan charchaa nahin karnaa chahta hum
 We contested on positive issues
 desh kii janata ko badhai ki usne development or good gavarnence se dhyaan hatane nahin diya
 There are several states where BJP won all seats
 gujarat, rajasthan, goa, dilli, himachal, uttarakhand, daman div, dadar nagar haveli, chandigarh or andaman nicobar
 We conquered from Ladakh to Kanyakumari
 ek baar jab england main chunaav hua tha
 Then the Conservative Party had conquered the Labor Party
 logon ne ise aitihaasik kaha tha
 But due to that political change, only economic policy was affected
 magar is baar ke badlaav ke baad bharat kii pratishtha antarrashtriya str par badi he
 Rating agency Moody's has put India in the Triple a category
 ham sirf aarthik nahin, saanskrithik or saamaajik rup se badlaav laane main kaamyaab hote hai
 i would like to recall Narendra Bhai's Hyderabad speech today

 Today i want to say as the party president

 bharat kii vayusena ke wing kamadar abhinandan vardhaman ko sahi salaamat bharat ko lautaane ke liye pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ko nobel kaa shanti puraskaar dene kii maang pakistan main uth rahi he
 Imran Khan has given a statement on this demand for the first time
 somvaar ko unhone twit kiya ki nobel puraskaar ke liye main yogya nahin hum
 However, Imran Khan did not miss the Kashmiri rant in this tweet too
 unhone likhaa ki nobel shanti puraskaar use milanaa chahie jo vyakti kashmir kii samasya ko kashmiri logon kii ichha ke anusaar sulajhaaye
 The solution to this problem will bring peace and development to the region
 unhone likhaa ki main is puraskaar ke yogya nahin hum
 i am not worthy of the Nobel Peace prize
 The person worthy of this would be the one who solves the Kashmir dispute according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people and paves the way for peace & human development in the subcontinent
 - Imran Khan (@imrankhanpti) March 4, 2019, let us know that India entered the air strike in Balakot, Pakistan after the Pulwama terror attack
 is airstrike main bhartiya vayusena ne jaish-e-mohammad ke thikaanon ko tabah kiya tha
 After this airstrike, the Pakistani Air Force entered into the Indian air range, in the chase of which an Indian aircraft fell into the Pakistan border
 isi ke wing commander abhinandan ko pakistani sena ne apni hiraasat main le liya tha, jiske baad bharat or antarashtriya dabaav ke baad pakistan ne do din ke andar unhen bharat ko waapas saunpa
 However, this whole process was presented by Imran Khan in such a way that he is giving the message of peace
 isi ke baad se pakistani sansad main ek prastaav pesh kiya gaya tha, bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav ko shant karne ke liye or yuddh ko taalane ke liye imran khan ko nobel kaa shanti puraskaar dene kii maang hui thi
 For this, a campaign was also run on social media and online petitions have also been put in place
 gauratlab he ki ek taraf imran khan shanti kii baat karte hai or kehete hai ki har masalaa baatcheet se hal hona chahie to vahiin duusari taraf unki sena border par lagaataar sizafire kaa ulanghan kar rahi he
 After India's Airstrike, Pakistan has become more angry and is targeting common people on the border

 Principal Secretary of Home Department R
 em
 Srivastava said that the Chaurasi Kosi Yatra traditionally takes place from Chaitra Purnima to the full moon day of Baisakh
 us hisaab se yah yatra 25 april se 20 may ke bich ho chuki he
 In such a situation, the proposed journey of VHP would start a new tradition, which the State Government has refused to allow to be removed, considering it unfair
 unhone bataaya ki ayodhya churaasi kosi yatra chah jilon faijabad, barabanki, gonda, ambedkarnagar, basti or baharich se hokar guzarati he
 Discussions were held in this connection with the District Collectors and Police Captains of these districts
 un sabhi ne is nayi parampara kii shuruyaat ko anuchit bataate hue is yatra ko nikaalane ke aadesh nahin dene kaa nirnay kiya tha
 Srivastava said that VHP leader Ashok Singhal had in a letter to the state government on August 10, sought permission to take the Chaurasi Kosi Yatra between August 25 and September 13
 patr main unhone kaha tha ki vah yah yatra isaliye nikaalnaa chaahate hai taaki ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan ho sake
 During this yatra starting on August 25, the gathering will enlist the VHP officials involved in the journey to the Ram temple and seek support from saints and saints from all over the country
 ab upi sarkaar ke faisle ke baad yatra par naa sirf siyasat shuru ho gai he balki isko puri takat se rokane kii taiyaari bhi upi sarkaar ne shuru kar di he
 On the other hand, the monk-saint too is fully prepared to tighten fourteen Kosi revolutions in every situation
 jiske chalate ek baar phir ayodhya baichaiyn ho uthi he
 This one and a half hundred year of Gandhi Jayanti has started
 pichley hi saal champaran satyagrah kaa saunva saal tha jab 1917 main gandhi champaran gaye the
 There will be many government programs to remember Gandhi from this 2 October to the next 2 October
 in kaaryakramon ke bich whatsap uniwarsity ke andarkhaane gandhi ji ko lekar kya chal rahaa he, uski saamagree bhi prakashit kii jaani chahie
 Gandhi is available to everyone
 jo chaahate hai unke liye bhi, jo nafrat karte hai unke liye bhi
 Everyone feels that they know all about Gandhi
 jo log umr se bade hai unke paas gandhi ko jaanane ke liye bahut si kitaaben hai
 There are books for those who have children, but in the last few months, there have been two books for children that should be talked about
 bacchon ko agar gandhi ke baribharakam jivan ke bare main bataanaa ho to phir kaise bataaenge
 This is a challenge
 jis kitaab kii ham baat karenge uske kai hisse milakar hamane ek kahani bana di he
 Mohan was not a courageous child
 bahut se duusare bacchon kii tarah hi use bhoot-pret kaa, daakuon kaa, saanp kaa dar laga rahata tha
 Laj was so comfortable that she was able to talk to anyone in school
 darataa tha ki dusron se baat karegaa, to ve uskaa mazaaq udaayenge
 Neither spoke excessively to teachers nor to his classmates
 ghanta bajane par hi vidhyalay main ghusata or chuttee hote hi tir kii tarah ghar laut jaataa
 a school was cleaning in Gujarat
 kaagazon ke ek puraane pulindia main kuch puraane parikshafal mili
 The report card of Mahatma Gandhi's childhood also came out
 badi jigyaasa thi, yah jaanane ke liye ki mohan kaisaa chaatr tha
 Some things are known from the reportcard, some do not even understand
 san 1881 main mohan ankaganit main or gujarati main paas ho gaya tha
 Mohan's name was also among the three students who did not get a single number in Geography
 saal ke akhir main 34 chaatro kii kaksha main uskaa sthaan 32waan tha
 That is laggards
 mohan saadhaaran sa chaatr tha
 Neither very intelligent nor very foolish
 sharir se bhi bahut phutila nahin tha
 Did not participate in sports, but there was a lot of walking practice
 phir kya mohan main koi bhi kubi nahin thi? How can this be possible? Every person has some qualities, even in Mohan
 usamen gajab kii jigyaasa thi
 Whoever wooed his mind, would get engaged in understanding it
 mehnat se, khule man se
 The school completed college, but Mohandas got the education that made Mohan a Mahatma
 acchhee baaten padhane se unhen phayda hua, par usase kahin zyaada laabh khud azamkar sikhi baton se
 Some people go to the laboratory for reading and understanding
 baapu ne apane jivan ko hi prayogshaala bana liya tha
 If needed, by buying books, i learned to wash clothes, learned to cook food, learned ambulance and nurse work, spinning and weaving clothes
 bal kaatna or tamil-urdu bhi kaamchalaoo sikh lee
 There was little desire to get a job after getting a degree behind Gandhi ji's learning and reading
 juute banane kaa kaam unhone apane ek dost siikhaa tha
 At that time people used to wear shoes in offices
 lekin mahondas ne patalun ke saath chappal yaa sandals pahananaa shuru kar diya, kyonki garm ilaakon main ye juuton kii tulana main aaraamdeh rahete hai
 His fashion wearing slippers and sandals was out
 ek baar jawaharlal nehru or sardaar patel ke saath congress ke kuch netaa maharashtra ke sewagram ashram aae
 He had to wait because Gandhiji was teaching some people to make slippers from leather
 jab unhone shikaayat kii, to gandhi ji ne unase kaha ki ve log bhi juuta chappal bananaa seekhen
 Later in 1932, the British Government jailed him with Sardar Patel
 sardaar ko juuton kii zarurat thi, lekin jail main koi mochi tha hi nahin
 Gandhiji told him that if he finds leather, then only he can make a shoe for the Sardar
 unhone bataaya ki unki banaai chappalon ko kuch log to aise sambhaal kar rakhte the ki vah koi dharohar ho
 While in jail, a letter was written with General Smuts, a top official of Mohandas's government
 yahi ve adhikari the jinaki vajah se mohandas ko baar-baar jail janaa padataa tha
 In a letter in 1913, he told General Smuts that he had made 15 sandals
 yah bhi ki agar general apane pair kaa naap bhej den to unke liye bhi sandals bana denge
 In 1914, when he was released from prison and left South Africa forever and returned to India, Mohandas presented this sandal to General Smuts
 bharat lautne par vah desi kapadon main aa gaye the
 In similar clothes, Gandhiji came to Bihar in 1917 to know the condition of the Champaran farmers
 vahaan ek din unhone ek aurat ko bahut gandi sari main dekha
 He told Kasturba - tell him to clean his clothes, take a bath
 usne kasturba ko jawaab diya- mere paas ek hi sari he
 Will i wear it if i wash it? Ask Bapu and get another saree, after bathing daily, you will also wash the saree
 us nirdhan mahila kaa haal sunakar gandhi ji bharra gaye
 He did not even imagine that his countrymen lived in such poverty
 unhen garibi or safai kaa rishta bhi samaj aa gaya
 This incident had a profound impact on Gandhiji, so much so that his dress also changed
 ek sampann dewan kaa betaa, jo videsh main mahange kapade or suut-boot main rahaa tha, aisi langot jaisi dhoti pahanane laga tha, jaisi ekadam garib mazdoor kisaan pahante the
 The people he wanted to work for good, became like him
 tippaniyan When India became independent in 1947, Mohan was 78 years old
 sabhi maanate hai ki hamaari azaadi kii ladaai ke sabase bade netaa mohandas gandhi hi the
 That is, our coward Mohan had removed fear not only from his heart but from the hearts of people across the country
 sopan joshi ne do kitaaben likhi hai
 One was for Mohan students from 9th to 12th and Bapu's Paati for students from 3rd to 8th
 hindi main he ye kitaab
 The Bihar government has also implemented the book on children of third grade in all schools
 kyonki yah kitaab champaran satyagrah shatabdi ke samay nitish kumaar ne banavaai thi
 Whether or not a chapter of this is read in the schools of Bihar every morning, only the people of Bihar can tell it, but this book has written that this should be done
 is kitaab ke liye gandhi ko bacchon ke liye bal sulabh banane vaale ek chitrakaar kii tarif bhi banati he
 Whose name is Somesh Kumar
 kya gandhi ke bare main kuch nayaa he jaanane ke liye
 
 
 Especially how to tell children about Gandhi without that too on 2 October
 mohan ek saahsee balak nahin tha
 Like many other children, he was afraid of ghosts, bandits and snakes
 laaj itani aati thi ki skool main kisi se baat karne main sakuchaata tha
 Afraid that if he would talk to others, they would make fun of him
 zarurat se zyaada baat na to shikshakon se karata tha or na hi apane sahpaathiyon se
 It was only after hour, he entered the school and returned home like an arrow when he was discharged
 gujarat main ek skool main safai ho rahi thi
 Some old test results were found in an old bundle of papers
 inamen mahatma gandhi ke bachapan kaa report-card bhi nikal aayaa
 There was great curiosity, to know how Mohan was a student
 reportcard se kuch baaten pataa chalati hai, kuch nahin bhi samaj aatin
 In 1881, Mohan passed in arithmetic and in Gujarati
 bhugol main jin teen chaatro ko ek bhi number nahin mila tha, unamem mohan kaa naam bhi tha
 At the end of the year, it was ranked 32nd in a class of 34 students
 yani phiseddi
 Mohan was an ordinary student
 na to bahut budhimaan or na hi ekadam budhu
 Even the body was not very agile
 khelkud main hissaa nahin letaa tha, lekin paidal chalane kaa khub abhyaas tha
 Then was there no quality in Mohan? aisa kaise ho saktaa he? har vyakti main kuch-na kuch gun hote hai, mohan main bhi the
 There was great curiosity in him
 jo bhi uske man ko lubhaata, use samajhane main jute jaataa
 Hard work, open heart
 skool college kii padhai puri kii, lekin mohan ko mahatma banane vaali shiksha to mohandas ko jivan se hi mili
 He benefited from reading good things, but more than that he learned by trying himself

 Once along with Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, some Congress leaders came to Sevagram Ashram in Maharashtra

 On his return to India, he came in desi clothes

 One day he saw a woman in a very dirty sari
 unhone kasturba se kaha- usase kaho ki apane kapade saaf kiya kare, nahaaya kare
 She replied to Kasturba - i have only one sari
 agar ise dhoungi to pahanuungi kya? baapu se kah kar ek or sari dilava dijie, rose nahaakar sari bhi dho luungi
 Gandhiji went to Bharara after hearing the condition of that poor woman

 He also understood the relation between poverty and cleanliness

 khaskar bacchon ko gandhi ke bare main kaise bataaen wo bhi bina 2 aktubar ke
 a school was cleaning in Gujarat
 kaagazon ke ek puraane pulindia main kuch puraane parikshafal mili
 The report card of Mahatma Gandhi's childhood also came out
 badi jigyaasa thi, yah jaanane ke liye ki mohan kaisaa chaatr tha
 Some things are known from the reportcard, some do not even understand
 san 1881 main mohan ankaganit main or gujarati main paas ho gaya tha
 Mohan's name was also among the three students who did not get a single number in Geography
 saal ke akhir main 34 chaatro kii kaksha main uskaa sthaan 32waan tha
 That is laggards
 mohan saadhaaran sa chaatr tha
 Neither very intelligent nor very foolish
 sharir se bhi bahut phutila nahin tha
 Did not participate in sports, but there was a lot of walking practice
 phir kya mohan main koi bhi kubi nahin thi? How can this be possible? Every person has some qualities, even in Mohan
 usamen gajab kii jigyaasa thi
 Whoever wooed his mind, would get engaged in understanding it
 mehnat se, khule man se
 The school completed college, but Mohandas got the education that made Mohan a Mahatma
 acchhee baaten padhane se unhen phayda hua, par usase kahin zyaada laabh khud azamkar sikhi baton se
 Some people go to the laboratory for reading and understanding
 baapu ne apane jivan ko hi prayogshaala bana liya tha
 If needed, by buying books, i learned to wash clothes, learned to cook food, learned ambulance and nurse work, spinning and weaving clothes
 bal kaatna or tamil-urdu bhi kaamchalaoo sikh lee
 There was little desire to get a job after getting a degree behind Gandhi ji's learning and reading
 juute banane kaa kaam unhone apane ek dost siikhaa tha
 At that time people used to wear shoes in offices
 lekin mahondas ne patalun ke saath chappal yaa sandals pahananaa shuru kar diya, kyonki garm ilaakon main ye juuton kii tulana main aaraamdeh rahete hai
 His fashion wearing slippers and sandals was out
 ek baar jawaharlal nehru or sardaar patel ke saath congress ke kuch netaa maharashtra ke sewagram ashram aae
 He had to wait because Gandhiji was teaching some people to make slippers from leather
 jab unhone shikaayat kii, to gandhi ji ne unase kaha ki ve log bhi juuta chappal bananaa seekhen
 Later in 1932, the British Government jailed him with Sardar Patel
 sardaar ko juuton kii zarurat thi, lekin jail main koi mochi tha hi nahin
 Gandhiji told him that if he finds leather, then only he can make a shoe for the Sardar
 unhone bataaya ki unki banaai chappalon ko kuch log to aise sambhaal kar rakhte the ki vah koi dharohar ho
 While in jail, a letter was written with General Smuts, a top official of Mohandas's government
 yahi ve adhikari the jinaki vajah se mohandas ko baar-baar jail janaa padataa tha
 In a letter in 1913, he told General Smuts that he had made 15 sandals
 yah bhi ki agar general apane pair kaa naap bhej den to unke liye bhi sandals bana denge
 In 1914, when he was released from prison and left South Africa forever and returned to India, Mohandas presented this sandal to General Smuts
 bharat lautne par vah desi kapadon main aa gaye the
 In similar clothes, Gandhiji came to Bihar in 1917 to know the condition of the Champaran farmers
 vahaan ek din unhone ek aurat ko bahut gandi sari main dekha
 He told Kasturba - tell him to clean his clothes, take a bath
 usne kasturba ko jawaab diya- mere paas ek hi sari he
 Will i wear it if i wash it? Ask Bapu and get another saree, after bathing daily, you will also wash the saree
 us nirdhan mahila kaa haal sunakar gandhi ji bharra gaye
 He did not even imagine that his countrymen lived in such poverty
 unhen garibi or safai kaa rishta bhi samaj aa gaya
 This incident had a profound impact on Gandhiji, so much so that his dress also changed
 ek sampann dewan kaa betaa, jo videsh main mahange kapade or suut-boot main rahaa tha, aisi langot jaisi dhoti pahanane laga tha, jaisi ekadam garib mazdoor kisaan pahante the
 The people he wanted to work for good, became like him
 tippaniyan When India became independent in 1947, Mohan was 78 years old
 sabhi maanate hai ki hamaari azaadi kii ladaai ke sabase bade netaa mohandas gandhi hi the
 That is, our coward Mohan had removed fear not only from his heart but from the hearts of people across the country
 sopan joshi ne do kitaaben likhi hai
 One was for Mohan students from 9th to 12th and Bapu's Paati for students from 3rd to 8th
 hindi main he ye kitaab
 The Bihar government has also implemented the book on children of third grade in all schools
 kyonki yah kitaab champaran satyagrah shatabdi ke samay nitish kumaar ne banavaai thi
 Whether or not a chapter of this is read in the schools of Bihar every morning, only the people of Bihar can tell it, but this book has written that this should be done
 is kitaab ke liye gandhi ko bacchon ke liye bal sulabh banane vaale ek chitrakaar kii tarif bhi banati he
 Whose name is Somesh Kumar

 Especially how to tell children about Gandhi without that too on 2 October
 reportcard se kuch baaten pataa chalati hai, kuch nahin bhi samaj aatin
 In 1881, Mohan passed in arithmetic and in Gujarati
 bhugol main jin teen chaatro ko ek bhi number nahin mila tha, unamem mohan kaa naam bhi tha
 At the end of the year, it was ranked 32nd in a class of 34 students
 yani phiseddi
 Mohan was an ordinary student
 na to bahut budhimaan or na hi ekadam budhu
 Even the body was not very agile
 khelkud main hissaa nahin letaa tha, lekin paidal chalane kaa khub abhyaas tha
 Then was there no quality in Mohan? aisa kaise ho saktaa he? har vyakti main kuch-na kuch gun hote hai, mohan main bhi the
 There was great curiosity in him
 jo bhi uske man ko lubhaata, use samajhane main jute jaataa
 Hard work, open heart
 skool college kii padhai puri kii, lekin mohan ko mahatma banane vaali shiksha to mohandas ko jivan se hi mili
 He benefited from reading good things, but more than that he learned by trying himself

 Gandhiji told him that if he finds leather, then only he can make a shoe for the Sardar

 The gun with which two black deer were hunted in Kankani area near Jodhpur and one and two on the night of October 1998 was Who had that gun that night? Who shot that night with that gun? Apparently the one who had the gun and the one who fired, is the culprit
 ab agar jodhpur ke chif jeudicial magistrate court ke faisle ko padhe to us raat bandook salmaan khan ke paas thi or salmaan khan ne hi kaale hiran par goli chalaai
 But after reading the Jodhpur bench of Rajasthan High Court on 25 July 2016, Salman Khan had no gun that night
 isiilie unhen arms act main reeha bhi kar diya gaya
 Did one and two alone hunt two black deer in Kankani area, 35 km from Jodhpur, on the intervening night of October 1998? Did Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Neelam and Sonali Bendre just sit together in Gypsy? Was both deer shot dead? And the shot of Salman Khan was shot? The copy of that decision is with Aaj Tak, in which the court of Jodhpur's Chief Judicial Magistrate convicted Salman Khan for five years in the case of hunting two black deer in Kankani
 
 isamen baqayada ghatana vaali raat kii puri jaankaree ke saath-saath vanya adhikari, jaanch adhikari or tamaam chashmadidon ke bayaan bhi darj hai
 Not only this, it is also written that according to the post mortem report, both black deer died due to bullet injuries
 yani saaf he ki shikari ke paas bandook bhi thi or shikaar bandook se hi hua
 But where are those guns? Why has that gun never been found in the last twenty years? And if that gun belonged to Salman Khan, then how was the Jodhpur Sessions Court acquitted Salman Khan in the Arms Act on 18 January 2017? Actually the Arms Act case and the case of two deer hunting in Kankani are two aspects of the same case
 
 jaanch adhikari ke daawey ke mutabik salmaan khan ne jis bandook se shikaar kiya tha us bandook ke license kii miyaad pehle hi khatm ho gai thi
 For this reason, a case was made against Salman Khan under the Arms Act
 magar jaanch adhikari ne jis bandook kii baat kii thi wo bandook naa to us gypsy se baraamad hui jisamen baith kar shikaar kiya gaya tha naa hi ummed bhawan ke us kamare se jahaan salmaan yaa baaki sitare tehre the
 However, immediately after the incident, the next morning and again on October 7, 1998, the forest department also searched the gypsy but nothing was found
 balki baad main ek bandook salmaan ke mumbai ke ghar se jarur baraamad hui
 After this, on the twelfth day of hunting ie on 12 October 1998, the forest department made claims to find pellets and kiosks of point-to-revolver and point-to-rifle from the gypsy used in hunting
 par wo saare chharre or khokhe bilkul nae the
 Whereas after staying in the gypsy for 12 days and raining, it should have been rusty
 par aisa hua nahin
 Not only this, forensic investigation later revealed that the pellets and bullets that killed both the black deer did not go away with Salman's gun
 balki goli kisi or bandook se chali thi
 But which gun it was, i do not know till date
 inhen sab aadhaar par jodhpur seshan court ne 18 janvari 2017 ko salmaan khan ko arms act main bari kar diya tha
 But now in the same case, the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court has convicted Salman Khan for shooting two black deer
 lihaaza kanoon ke jaankaar ye sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki jab ek hi cese ke ek maamle main salmaan bari ho gaye to duusare main doshi kaise ho sakate hai? salmaan ke vakil ne seshan court main zamaanat ke liye is mudde ko sabase zyada pramukhataa se uthaaya he

 party ko ummid he ki akhilesh kii bedaag chhavi or mukhyamantri ke taur par unke saral vyavhaar kaa phayda loksabhaa chunaav main bhi mil saktaa he

 The way Hardik Pandya has performed in odis and T20s, Team India seems to get a batsman for the role of finishers
 khaas baat yah ki pandya tenge gendbaaji karne vaala olerounder hai
 And the team of such a player was looking for a long time
 hardik pandya ne antarrashtriya cricket main oktober 2016 main kadam rakhaa tha
 He got a chance in Dharamsala ODI against New Zealand
 abtak unhone 17 vanade main 41
 He has batted at an average of 28, as well as 19 wickets
 haalanki tii-20 international main vah balle se zyada safal nahin rahe hai
 He has an average of 10 in 19 matches, although he has taken 15 wickets

 # hardikpandya # aalimhakim # salonhakimsaalim # teamhakimsaalim # harocks 🤘A post shared by Salon Hakim's Aalim (@aalimhakim) onjul 17, 2017 at 2:54 am PDT lokapal se jude vibhinn muddon par asahmati jataa chuki sibiai ko team anna kaa bhi samarthan mil gaya he, jisane kaha ki sthaayee samiti ke suzav khatarnaak hai or inhen khaarij kiya janaa chahie
 Team Anna member Arvind Kejriwal said, "we support the cbi's opposition and believe that the report of the Standing Committee is dangerous and should be rejected
" unhone kaha ki yadi siforeeshon ko lagu kiya gaya, to isse sibiai kii karypranali pangu ho jaaegi
 Kejriwal said that by making the preliminary inquiry mandatory for all the cases, corrupt people can come to know that they are in the eyes of the CBI and they can save themselves even before being raided
 unhone kaha, ham sibiai kii daleel kaa samarthan karte hai or ve siforeeshon kaa sahi virodh kar rahe hai
 Kejriwal alleged that the government was using Hazare's campaign to dilute the role of the CBI
 kejariwal kaa bayaan aise samay par aayaa he, jab sibiai ne carmik or prashikshan vibhaag ko patr likhakar kaha ki kisi maamle ko sibiai ko die jane se pehle uski lokapal dwaara praarambhik jaanch kiye jane ko anivaary banaae jane kaa prastaavit kadam bhrashtachar ke maamalon ke khilaaf agency kii prabhaviktaa ko gambhir rup se nuksaan pahunchayegaa
 CBI sources said that with this proposed step, the agency would lose its shocking element ie starting a search operation
 patr ke mutabik vartmaan samay main agency vibhinn sroton se soochna ikattha karti he, yojana banaati he or dastavejon evam saakshyon ko hasil karne ke liye talaashi abhiyaan chalaati he
 Facing criticism from the people on the law and order front, it became an embarrassing situation for the Bihar Police when former Chief Minister of the state Dr

 Actually, Dr

 It was also announced by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself, but during the funeral the police did not work even a single rifle causing a ridiculous situation

 lekin iske baavjood zila police kii taiyaari kaalam ye tha ki ek bhi banduq se fyring nahin ho pai
 Usually ten are fired from rifles, but not one has worked
 haalanki is ghatana kaa videoviral hone ke baad jila police ne ab jaanch ke aadesh diye hai
 District Superintendent of Police MK Chaudhary says that these weapons may not have worked due to the weather, but the investigation of the whole case is on

 Government of India is celebrating Parakram Parv on the completion of 2 years of surgical strikes

 BSF DG KK Sharma said in his press conference that even after Imran Khan's government came there was no change in the attitude of Pakistan
 imran kii sarkaar aane ke baad line of control (loc) or international border (IB) par pakistan kiaakraamakatabari he
 This also proves the manner in which he killed BSF head constable Narendra Singh
 sharma ne kaha, 'pakistan kii nai sarkaar aane ke baad bhi border par kuch nahin badla he
 We can say that after the new government came, Pakistan's migration on the international border and LOC has increased
 biguef ke diji ne yah bhi kaha ki seemaa se sate launch pad par aatanki is samay bhi maujuud hai
 Raising terror is Pakistan's policy
 wo ab bhi seemapar se aatankiyon ko bhej rahaa he or inaki ghuspaith karaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Pakistan is following Ziaul Haq's policy
 diji keke sharma ne kaha, 'hamaare jawan narendra singh kii hatya pakistan kii BAT team ne kiya
 This incident is very sad
 jawan narendra singh kaa galaa kaat diya gaya tha
 He was also shot 3 bullets
 sharma ne kaha, 'loc par hamane pakistan ko jawaab dena shuru kar diya he
 Now we will decide on what action will be taken against them by the International Border
 'unhone kaha ki bharat ke rukh ko dekhte hue pakistan ne international border se sate apane gaanvon ko khaali karvaa liya he
 According to the BSF, the Rangers of Pakistan have also called the Regular Army for their assistance in this area for fear of action
 jaankaree ke mutabik is international border ke us paar 5 kilometre kii duuri ke zyaadaatar gaanv ko pakistan ne khaali kara liya he
 Sharma said that Pakistan is afraid that if BSF takes strong action, then Pakistan could suffer huge losses
 yahi vajah he ki bisaef ke dar se pakistan international border ke us paar kai jagahon par apni mortar pojishan bhi laga lee he
 Before this, whenever there was an attack from Pakistan, then BSF has given a proper answer
 BAT ko lekar sharma ne kaha kiinternational borderake us paar pehali baar is tareeke kii ghatana ko pakistan ne anjaam diya he
 Earlier, the BAT had not carried out this type of incident around the international border
 keke sharma ke mutabik border ection team loc ke ilaake main kai baar javaanon par hamalaa kar chuki he, lekin aisa pehali baar dekha gaya he ki international border ke paas BAT ne is tareeke kaa hamalaa kiya
 Many terrorist launching pads across the border, Sharma said that there is no doubt that there are many terrorist launching pads across the border
 kai baar aatankiyon ke lonching pad border se mahaj paanch se saat kimi duuri par hi hote hai
 He said that there is no doubt that technology has made the challenges easier

 The government has taken cognizance of the sting operation to 'black' the grain of the poor and has asked us for an 'unedited' form of sting operation for further investigation
 ajtak ne sarkaar kii sabase badi skim main lage kalabazari ke ghun kaa khulaasa kiya he
 The amount of the scheme is so large that if you write it in the number then you will keep counting the number
 ek lakh 25 hajaar karod yani sava lakh karod rupee kii khaadya suraksha yojana, jise ye sarkaar apni sabase badi kamyaabi maan rahi he
 But Aaj Tak has brought the black truth of this scheme to everyone
 desh main garibi khatm hogi or desh main bhukh mitegi jaise naaron ke saath kanoon ban chukaa he or boli lag chuki he gehun 2 rupaya, chaaval 3 rupee kilo
 From Parliament to the roads, the government has announced that a sum of one and a quarter lakh crores will be spent and wheat and rice will be delivered to the poor from house to house
 sarkaar kii ore se yahi daawa kiya gaya tha ki chhattisgarh ke ghaney jangal hon yaa assam ke dur-daraaj ke pahaad yaa phir rajasthan kaa retila ilaaka
 Now wheat and rice will be filled in godowns to satisfy every Indian's hunger
 lekin is saal ke sabase bade vaade kaa jamini sach ajtak sabase saamne le aayaa he
 The question arises that
 
 
 # kya vaaki garibon ko 2 rupee main genhun mil rahaa he? # kya teen rupee kaa chaaval unke pet main ja rahaa he? # kya rashan kii dukaane unki bhukh mitaa rahi hai? # kya godaamon se gehun garibon tak pahunch rahaa he?in sawaalon kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye desh ke kisi bhi dur-daraaj ke ilaake main jane kii katai bhi jarurat nahin he
 What to go more far: The Parliament from which the announcement has been made, the law of law is seen flying in Mayapuri, Delhi, five kilometers away from the same Parliament
 mayapuri main hi food korporation of india yani epasiai kaa sabase bada godaam bhi he
 The warehouse at Mayapuri is one of the largest warehouses of FCI
 rojaanaa yahaan se anginat trek anaaj bhar-bharkar rashan kii dukaanon par jate hai or phir vahiin se 2 rupee or 3 rupee main gehun or chaaval garibon tak pahunchataa he
 But you have also come to know the truth
 ajtak ke is oparation blike ne sarkaar kii arabon rupee kii yojana kii kalai khol di he
 Every hideous picture of corruption of officers and businessmen has been exposed
 oparation blike ne khulaasa kiya he ki kaise desh ke garibon ke saath kaisaa khilwaad ho rahaa he
 There is no starvation in this country of 1
25 billion people, so the government made a plan of 1
25 billion crore
 sansad main wo kanoon bhi ban gaya
 But a few kilometers away from the Parliament, this law broke
 ji haa, sarkaar kii naak ke neeche dilli main hi saream garibon kaa rashan blike ho rahaa he or wo bhi saat gune daam par
 FCI has the largest warehouse in Mayapuri area of delhi
 dilli sarkaar kaa garibon main bantane vaala rashan kaa gehun isi godaam main rakhaa jaataa he
 In Delhi, there is the keeper of this wheat, the Minister of Food and Supplies Harun Yusuf and the officers and employees of Yusuf Saheb are tasked to deliver this wheat to the poor
 garibon kaa hajaaron ton gehun garibon ke bajaay dallalon tak na pahunch jaye is nigaraanee ke liye enforcement kii ek baari-bharkam team bhi he
 Arrangements are sure that there is no dishonesty of even a rupee, but if the law is put in place, then the story of the thief and the boat is here
 sutron ke hawaale se ajtak ko pataa laga ki garibon kaa hajaaron ton gehun mayapuri ke sarkari godaam se rashan kii dukaan na pahunch kar dilli kii badi-badi aataa milon tak ja rahaa he
 Police, officers and businessmen are involved in this game of crores of rupees
 isaki padtaal ke liye ajtak ne mayapuri godaam se nikalne vaale rashan ke trakon kaa peechha kiya
 Truck number DL 1M 1475 left from fci's warehouse left for the government ration shop, but the truck diverted its way midway
 pashchimi dilli ke shakti nagar ilaake se ye trek laurence road kii taraf mud gaya
 Lawrence Road, where the country's largest flour mills are located
 laurence road main trek ek badi aataa mil ke paas rukaa or gehun kii boriyaan utaarna shuru kar diya
 Wheat sacks that were supposed to go to the ration shop for the poor went to the golden floor mill
 desh kii sarkari rashan vyavastha ko kuchalata hua ek or trek DL 1GB 4035 epasiai ke godaam se niklaa, lekin is trek ne bhi bich main apni manzil badali or pahunchaa usee privet floor mil main
 Another truck coming from FCI DL 1G b 3953 also diverted its route and stopped directly at Lawrence Road
 sarkari kaagajon par in sabhi trakon ko garibon kaa pet bharna tha, lekin sach yahi he ki ye trek bhi garibon kaa pet kaatane ke liye sarkari godaam se nikle hai
 Another embarrassing picture is that the wheat of the poor is being blackened on the streets
 garibon kaa 2 rupee kaa gehun sadak par 12 rupee main blike hokar privet milon main ja rahaa he
 Till today, the investigation was going on that the owner of the truck, Sharma ji reached the spot on a panic
 sharma ji kaa transport kaa kaam he or zyaadaatar epasiai ke godaam se rashan kii dukaanon par gehun inhen ke trakon se jaataa haih inke har trek par ketisi likhaa hua he jo peedies ke gehun supplai karne ke liye code verde he
 Most of the trucks are run by Sharma ji and they have made an identity on the truck so that their trucks do not get caught on the way
 sabhi trek ketisi ke naam se chalate hai or yahi inaki pahchaan he
 This code of Sharma is so effective that even the police cannot touch his trucks
 sharmaji ko police kaa bhi koi dar nahin he
 Sharma told that the official seal on the sacks is removed before going to the mills
 sharma ji yaheen nahin ruke unhone baton-baton main bataaya ki rashan ke gehun ke bina koi bhi aataa mil zyada dinon tak chal hi nahin sakati
 Truck number- HR 55 e 1145 This truck also came out of fci's Mayapuri godown and reached directly to another floor mill on Lawrence Road
 is mil kaa naam hathi brands floor mil he
 The PDS has been stamped on all the sacks reached at the elephant floor mill
 or ye gehun bhi sarkari rashan kii dukaan par utarana tha, lekin khuleam garibon kaa ye gehun aataa mil main utar gaya

 According to PTI, the fiery outburst erupted when Bihar Assembly Speaker Vijaykumar Chaudhary rejected the adjournment motion brought by the opposition regarding various scams in the state
 tejasvi ne apni seat se khadey hokar ise ati mahatvapurn vishay bataaya or aarope lagaaya ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar, jo ki pehle sushasan ke liye jane jate the, ab bhrashtachar ke 'bhishma pitamah' ke rup main jane jate hai
 Tejashwi alleged that "there is no day that news of a new scam is not seen in Bihar
