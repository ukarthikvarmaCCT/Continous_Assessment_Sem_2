 hindu dharm main somnath kaa apana ek alag hi sthaan he
 The Somnath Temple has the first position among the 12 Jyotirlingas
 itnaa hi nahin, kehete hai mahadev apane is dar par kisi bhi bhakt khaali nahin lautne dete hai
 As you step into the Prabhas region through Saurashtra in Gujarat, it is visible from far away that the flag that has been celebrated for thousands of years, commemorating Lord Somnath, realizes the fame of Shiva and his fame
 aasmaan ko sparsh karata mandir kaa shikhar devadhidev kii mahima kaa bakhaan karata he, jahaan apane bhavy rup main mahadev bhakton kaa kalyaan karte hai
 According to a mythological belief, the Jyotirlinga established in the Somnath temple is the first Rudra Jyotirlinga established among the two Jyotirlingas, where every wish of those who come and offer their mind to God is fulfilled
 ummiido kii khaali jholii liye shraddhalu subah se hi bhagwaan somnath ke darshanon ke liye umadane lagate hai
 There is this unwavering belief in the mind of every devotee who comes here that now all their feelings will come to an end
 koi apane paapon ke praayshchit ke liye aata he, to koi apane suhaag kii lambii aayu kii mannath lekar somnath rup bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana karata he, to koi apane naunihaal ko bhagwaan ke darbar main is ummid ke saath lekar aata ki bhagwaan se use lambey or nirogi jivan kaa aashirwad mil sake
 Thousands of devotees reach here every day beyond the borders of the world
 mandir main sabase pehle bhakton kii bhent bhagwaan ke priy vaahan nandi se hoti he, jinhen dekhakar aisa lagata he maano nandi bhagwaan ke har bhakt kii aguwayi kar rahe hon
 After reaching inside the temple, it is felt to be in a different world, whichever side it appears, there is some form of the miracle of God
 bhagwaan ke adbhut rup ke shringaar kaa sakshi banane kaa mauka koi bhi bhakt gavaana nahin chahta
 On the forehead, the most panchamrit bath of Mahadev, the God of the Gods holding the Moon, is given a bath
 snaan ke baad baari aati ke unke bhavy or alokik shringaar kii
 The Shivling is inscribed with sandalwood and then a bell leaf is offered
 shiv bhakthi main duube bhakt apane aradhy kaa yah alokik rup dekhte hi rah jate hai
 They begin to realize that this life has been blessed
 bhagwaan somnath kii puja ke baad mandir ke pujari bhagwaan ke har rup kii aradhana karte hai, jise dekhnaa apane aap main saubhaahgya kii baat he
 Finally the aarti of that ocean is descended which first rises first in the morning and anoints the feet of the Lord with its waves, but the devotees do not forget to recommend their vows to God from Nandi Ji, the vehicle of the Lord, because the devotees believe It is said that Nandi ji brings all his requests to his worship
 somnath mandir kii banaavat or mandir kii deevaaron par kii gai shilpkaaree shiv bhakthi kaa utkrishth namoona he
 The history of Somnath temple tells that from time to time many attacks on the temple were sabotaged
 mandir par kul 17 baar akraman hue or har baar mandir kaa jirnonddhaar karaayaa gaya, lekin mandir par kisi bhi kalkhand kaa koi prabhaav dekhne ko nahin miltaa
 It is said that this Shivalinga was present even at the time of creation of the universe, its importance has also been mentioned in the Rigveda
 dharm granthon ke anusaar shraap se mukti paane ke liye chandramaa ne yahaan shiv ji kii aradhana kii thi isliye chandramaa yani som ke naam par hi is mandir kaa naam padaa somnath
 According to the Shiva Purana, in the ancient times, King Daksha had 27 daughters, who were married to Moon by King Daksha, but Moon gave only one of the 27 girls to Rohini as wife
 daksh ne damaad ko bahut samajhane kii koshish kii, lekin jab unhone daksh kii baat nahin maani to unhone chandramaa ko kshay rogi hone kaa shraap de diya or chandradev kii kanti dhoomil padane lagani
 Troubled, the moon reached Brahmadev
 chand yani som kii samasya sun brahma ne unase kaha ki unhen kusht rog se sirf mahadev hi mukti dilaa sakate hai, lekin iske liye unhen saraswati ke muhane par sthit agarab sagar main snaan kar bhagwaan shiv kii upasna kerani hogi
 To be healthy, the Moon performed austerity, which pleased Mahadev and freed him from the curse
 shivbhakt chandradev ne yahaan shiv ji kaa swarna mandir banwaaya or usamen jo jyotirling sthapit hua uskaa naam chandramaa ke swami yani somnath pad gaya
 The moon had regained its radiance at this place, so this area came to be called Prabhas Patan

 In Chhattisgarh, farmers have come out on the streets to demand paddy purchase before Diwali
 unke mutabik naa to tyohaar manaane ke liye unke paas paisa he or naa hi karj chukaane ke liye
 More than 10 thousand crore paddy is procured annually in the state
 aamtaur par yah kharidi ek navambar se shuru ho jaati he
 But this time the state government has decided to start purchasing paddy from November 15
 iske chalate rajya bhar main kisaan andolan kar rahe hai
 The Congress has given vent to this agitation of farmers by saying that the priority of the government is not the farmer but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's arrival in Chhattisgarh on 1 November
 darasal pradhanmantri modi kai yojanaon ke udghaatan ke silsile main 1 navambar ko raipur aa rahe hai
 From Raipur to Bastar to Bilaspur to Surguja these days, the batch of farmers can be seen clearly shouting slogans against the government
 kisaan is baat ko lekar ukhde hue hai ki is baar dhan kii kharidi 1 navambar kii bajaay 15 navambar se shuru ho rahi he
 Deepawali is on the head, the moneylender is struggling to repay the loan

 But their hopes were rekindled when the government extended the purchase of paddy 15 days ahead
 aamtaur par rajya main chhattisgarh ke gathan kii varshganth 1 navambar ke din se dhan kii kharidi hoti he
 There has never been a situation in the last 15 years that the date of purchase of paddy has to be changed

 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is coming to Raipur on Chhattisgarh's anniversary on 1 November

 The Congress alleges that farmers are being ignored for the Prime Minister's program
 congress ke mutabik bijepi kii sarkaar ne pradhanmantri ko khush karne ke liye kisaanon ko musiibat main daal diya he
 On the other hand, the government argues that due to delayed monsoon in the state, the date of procurement of paddy has to be extended

 After harvesting of crops, it takes 15 full days to dry and maintain

 The Madras High Court has rejected the decision of acquittal of former Communications Minister Dayanidhi Maran and others by the special CBI court in the telephone exchange case, saying there was a spate of evidence against him
 darasal dayaanidhi maaran par apane bhai kalanidhi maaran ke san tivi network ko laabh pahunchane ke liye avaidh telephone exange sthapit karne kaa aarope he
 The High Court Judge G
 Jayachandran, while granting the cbi's appeal against the decision to discharge them all, directed the Special Court to frame the charges and said that the trial of the trial would be completed within a year of getting the copy of the High Court order
 To be done
 court kaa kahana he ki sabhi aropiyon ke khilaaf aarope tay karne ke liye paryaapt saboot hai
 On the other hand, none of the reasons for which he was acquitted by the lower court are right in terms of law
 hai court ne kaha he ki is maamle me sibiai adalatadwara mandandon kaa ghor ulanghan kiya gaya he
 Therefore, the decision to acquit them was irrational and illegal and therefore needs to be rectified
 dayaanidhi ke vakil ne daleel thi ki unhone apane kaarykaal main broadband ko lokapriy banane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 To which the High Court said that this does not mean that Dayanidhi's brother and his business establishment are allowed to avail the facility free of cost
 bataa den ki nichali adaalat ne 14 march ko maaran bandhuon or anya ko aarope mukt karte hue kaha tha ki unke khilaaf paryaapt saboot nahin hone ke kaaran pratham drushtya koi maamla nahin banataa
 The case dates back to the UPA government when DMK chief m Karunanidhi's relative was the Minister of Communications and Information Technology in the Dayanidhi government

 fasebuk lokation trekking ek bada mudda he
 Especially for those who like privacy
 haalanki lokation of karne ke baad aisa lagata he ki fasebuk aapako trek nahin karegaa
 But maybe it is wrong
 kyonki vigyaapan ke liye company yujar lokation trek karata rahata he
 One such researcher says
 america research ne haal hi main yah paaya he ki fasebuk ko lokation trekking se rokane kaa koi tarika hi nahin he
 Yes, it is a different matter that you stop using Facebook, delete the account
 research ne kaha he ki agar aap fasebuk ap ke liye lokation of kar lete hai phir bhi har sambhavit tareeke se fasebuk aapaki lokation trek karne kii koshish main laga rahata he
 It is being told that this is because the model of facebook is advertisement based and it can also put the privacy of the user at stake for this
 aisa haal ke kuch li or data brich main bhi paaya gaya he
 Alexandra Corollo, assistant professor of computer science at the University of South California, has given information about this at the medium
 yahaan yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki kaise fasebuk unke lokation par aadhaarik targated vigyaapan detaa he, jabaki unhone na to profile main apni lokation ditels daali he or na hi lokation on kiya he
 Not only this, they used all kinds of methods so that the location is not shared
 corolova kaa kahana he ki unhone fasebuk ap main lokation history of kar liya tha or ios kii settings main bhi unhone fasebuk k liye lokation acces ko disable kar rakhaa tha
 Apart from this, he did not upload his city and any location-tagged photos and content on Facebook profiles
 lekin phir bhi lagaataar unhen unke ghar or daftar ke lokation ke aadhaar par vigyaapan die gaye
 According to Korolova, the location control given on Facebook is an illusion and it is not control at all
 fasebuk ne gijmodo se kaha he, ‘ham ypi adress or duusari jaankariyaan yuj karte hai jinamein check ins or profile ke curent shahar hote hai
 We tell people about it and it is written on the advertisement page

 The High Court has reserved the verdict after hearing all the parties in the matter
 dilli hoicourt se aane vaale faisle se ye tay hoga ki rajya sarkaar kaa yah circular ab aage maanya rahegaa yaa phir hoicourt ise radd karegi

 donon kii jodi kii misaal he 'insite'in donon ke shabd or swar kii jodi ke asar ko hameshaa badhata hi dekha gaya
 Whenever we come across some of his special songs, we get lost
 nida fazali ke dohon kaa elbum jagajeet singh ne 1990 ke dashak main gaaya tha
 He set a record of popularity
 is elbum kaa naam thinsite
 It shares India's shared culture and humanism with great innocence
 behad saadagi bhari likhaawat or madhur aawaaj se is elbum kaa khumaar ab bhi logon ke sar chadhakar bolta he
 What is the news for the senses? 
 
 filmi gaanon main sarfarosh kaa ‘hoshwalon ko khabar kya, bekhudi kya chiz he’ bahutalokapriyahua tha
 Nida Sahab repeated this song on 8 February 2012, remembering Jagjit Singh
 jaanakar hairat hogi ki is ghazal ko gane ke liye jagajeet singh ne film banane waalon se koi fees nahin lee thi
 Get out in the sun 
 
 nida fazli ke likhe dhoop main niklo, ghatao main nahaakar dekho kaa jagajeet singh ke gane ke baad kai bhashaaon mekhanuwadakiya gaya
 Mukhtar Lailpuri, who has translated it into English, has uploaded most of the songs sung by Jagjit Singh on youtube and Doha, Ghazals and songs written by Nida
 gaalib ke bahanein dononshahakarone milakar andaaje bayaan or
 
 yani gaalib ko sangeet premiyon ke bich bhi introdeus karavaaya
 In this, Jagjit's voice with Nida's notes on Ghalib and his compositions cast a spell on the fans
 naa tha kuch
 
 
 This album, which has come in front of people by name, has so far made its special place among the people
 koi fariyaad tere dil main chuphi ho jaise
 
 
 In the 2001 film Anubhav Sinha's Hindi film Tum Bin, written by Nida and sung by Jagjit, this ghazal had captured every house
 is superhit ghazal ke liye likhane or gane vaale donon ne lanbaa vakt liya tha

 uttar pradesh main ek taraf siem yogi adityanath bharat band ke dauraan police dwaara bina bhedbhaav ke karrwai kii baat kah rahe hai
 On the other hand, the resentment of Dalit mps against the BJP leadership in UP is continuously increasing
 bijepi saansad savitri bai phule se shuru hua silsilaa chauthe dalit saansad kii naaraazgi tak pahunch chukaa he
 Now BJP MP from Nagina Yashwant Singh has expressed his displeasure with the Modi government
 yashavanth singh ne SC / ST act par supreme ke faisle ko lekar sarkaar par sawaal uthaae hai
 Yashwant Singh, in a letter to PM Narendra Modi, has raised the voice of the interests of Dalits
 letters main yashavanth singh ne likhaa ki vahjatav samaajake saansad hai
 Yashwant Singh accused the Modi government that nothing was done directly for the Dalit society with a population of 30 crore in 4 years
 backlog puraa karnaa, pramotion main aarakshan bill paas karnaa, privet naukariyon main aarakshan dilaanaa aadi maangen nahin puri kii gai
 According to Yashwant, he was able to become an MP due to reservation
 haalanki unki yogyata kaa upyog nahin ho rahaa he or unhone bataaya ki saansad banane ke baad unhone piem modi se maang kii thi ki pramotion main aarakshan bill paas karaayaa jaae
 However, this demand has not been met yet
 naaraazgi jaahir karte hue yashavanth ne kaha ki aaj bijepi ke dalit saansad pratadna ke shikaar ban rahe hai
 They are not able to answer the public on many issues
 iske saath hi yashavanth singh ne maang kii ki modi sarkaar SC / ST act par supreme ke faisle ko koshish kar palatwaaye
 Also complete the backlog, pass the reservation bill in promotion and get reservation in private jobs
 aapako bataa den ki yashavanth se pehle itawa kebijapi saansad ashok dohrene apni hi sarkaar se naaraazgi jataai thi
 Ashok Dohra has complained to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the case of filing of cases against Dalits on 2 April Bharat Bandh
 bataa den ki isse pehle mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke ravaiye ke khilaaf dalit saansad chhotelal kharwar ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr likhakar apana dard bayaan kiya tha
 In Kharwar's letter, the UP administration has complained of forcible occupation of her house and recognition of her forest
 vahiin bijepi saansad savitri bai phule ne apni hi sarkaar ke khilaaf rajdhani lakhanu sthit kanshiram smriti upavan main 'bhartiya samvidhan or aarakshan bachaao mahareli kaa aayojan' kiya
 During this time, he had said that reservation is not a begging, but a matter of representation
 agar aarakshan ko khatm karne kaa dussahas kiya gaya to bharat kii dharti par khun kii nadiyaan bahengi

 The judges put the ball in the CBI court in this case, saying that if the investigating agency says that there is no bias in it, then the petition will be dismissed

 Customer will be king in GST! Tax evasion stopped! Bounce in GDP! States earn more! The terror of tax officers is over! Great facilities for small businessmen! If there was any shortfall in the flight of expectations from GST, then the Prime Minister's address to the Lok Sabha of 8 August has fulfilled it
 darasal, 2014 ke narendra modi or 2016 ke jiesti main ek badi samanta he
 Both have come riding on the tide of expectations
 2014 main jaagi ukvamido kaa to pataa nahin, alabatta pradhanmantri ke paas jiesti ko aisa sudhaar banane kaa mauka jarur he jo arthvyavastha ke ek bade kshetra kaa kayakalp karne or doorgaami phaayde dene kii kuwwat rakhata he
 Incidentally, the Prime Minister has enough political power to make GST a success, as well as the provisions of the GST approved by both houses of parliament with unprecedented consensus that the GST can make revolutionary reforms provided the central government has the wisdom and restraint
 Could lead the political leadership of GST
 sansad kii dahalij paar karte hue jiesti ko teen aisi nematen mil gai hai jo bharat main is tarah ke (centre va sabhi rajyon ke samuhik) itane bade sudhaar ke paas pehle kabhi nahin thim
 1
 sansad se manjuur jiesti vidheyak main rajyon kii adhikaar praapt samiti ke sabhi suzav or centre kii sahmati shaamil he
 VAT (value Added Tax), the ancestor of GST, did not get this consent gift in 2005
 gujarat, rajasthan, madhya pradesh or uttar pradesh sahit saat rajyon ne puure desh ke saath milakar waite lagu nahin kiya
 These states later joined this reform
 2
 For the first time in the form of GST Council, the country is getting a better powerful federal committee, in which the collective rights of the states are more than the center
 aarthik faislon ke maamle main yah apni tarah kaa pehla prayog he jo achche jiesti kii buniyaad bananaa chahie
 3
 rajya sarkaron ke sambhavit vittiya nuksaan kaa beemaa ho gaya he
 If the tax is reduced by the implementation of GST, the central government will compensate it for five years
 pehali baar di gai is sanvaidhanik guarantee ke baad jiesti ko upabhoktaaon ke liye kam boj vaala banane kaa vikalp khul gaya he
 After a broad consensus, a transparent decision-making system and a guarantee to offset the losses of the states, GST can certainly be a structural reform, but for this, the central government will have to essentially ensure six arrangements in the formation of GST
 yah kaam sirf centre sarkaar hi kar sakati he kyonki jiesti kaa netritv narendra modi or arun jetali kii team hi karegi
 First: if Modi wants to make customers king in GST, then he will have to form a political consensus to keep the standard rate of GST at 18%
 rajyon main state waite kii standard dar 14
 5 per cent, which covers 60 per cent of the products, while Central Excise has 12
 36 standard dar adhikansh utpaadon par lagu hoti he
 The rate of service tax is 15 percent
 yadi in teenon ko milakar 18 fisadi kii standard jiesti dar tay ho sake to yah jiesti kii sabase badi safalataa hogi
 Under this rate, tax on some products and services will increase, but the benefits of mixing many other taxes will balance it and inflation will be controlled
 centre sarkaar rajyon ko is santulan ke liye raji kar sakati he kyonki samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ne unke ghate kii bharpai ko sunishchit kar diya he
 Second: Energy and land are the biggest costs of economic production but electricity, petrochemicals and stamp duty are outside GST
 in par tex ghataae bina kaarobaar kii laagat kam karnaa asambhav he
 These have to be brought under the purview of GST
 centre sarkaar teen saal kii kaaryayojna ke tahat jiesti council ko aisa karne par sahamat kar sakati he
 Third: The Center must decide that GST should not increase the cost of compliance for the business
 jiesti kaa draft bill khaufnak he
 It has provisions like multiple (central and State) assessments, dozens of registrations, returns and convictions of one taxpayer
 agar inhen khatm na kiya gaya to jiesti tex terarysm kaa namoona ban saktaa he
 Fourth: Moving forward on the path of GST, the central government will have to devise new ways of raising non-tax revenue in the states and measures to reduce expenditure
 vitt ayog or niti ayog is maamle main aguai kar sakate hai
 Under the GST Act, the possibility of change in the tax rules in the states has to be limited
 paanchvaan:swatchta, buniyadi dhaanche or anya jaruraton ke liye sthaneey nikaayon ko sansaadhan chahie
 Many such taxes are being included in GST which are the source of income of these bodies
 centre ko yah dhyaan rakhana hoga ki jis tarah centre ke rajasav main rajyon kaa hissaa tay he, thik usee tarah rajyon ke rajasav main sthaneey nikaayon kaa hissaa nirdhaarit ho
 Sixth: While deciding the GST arrangement, the Center-led GST Council will have to engage all parties, consumers, small and big entrepreneurs, local bodies at all levels, which has not been done yet
 bahut se log yah kehete mil jaaenge ki jiesti na hone se ek kamjor jiesti hona behatar he lekin hakeekat yah he ki ek ghatiya jiesti jo samasyaayein paidaa karegaa, unki roshni main jiesti kii anupasthiti hi behatar he
 GST is the second generation of the first generation of reforms in India and has only laid its foundation

 uttar pradesh ke kaushambi jile main ek bete ne apane pita ko danda se peet peet kar maut ke ghat utaar diya
 The accused son, taking trouble with his drunken father's antics, took this frightening step
 hatya kii yah sansanikhej vaardaat kaushambi jile ke charava thana kshetra kii he
 Where 50-year-old Chandrabhan Pasi, living in Chaphuyan village, used to drink alcohol daily and beat and abused his wife and children
 uski is harakat se ghar vaale or padosi bhi pareshaan the
 Last night too, he came drunkenly and started abusing wife Kusum
 badebetebrujesh ne use aisa karne se manaa kiya lekin vah nahin mana or kusum ko maarane laga
 Then his son, along with his mother, beat Chandrabhan's pole fiercely
 police ke anusaar pitayee kii vajah se paasi kii maukey par hi maut ho gai
 After carrying out the incident, both mother and son escaped from the scene
 subah padosiyon ne ghar ke bheetar dekha to paasi kaa shav pada hua tha
 Neighbors immediately reported this to the police
 soochna milane ke baad maukey par pahunchi police ne chandrabhan kashwakabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej diya he
 After the incident, the deceased's brother and other relatives reached the spot
 thana prabharee ram aasare saroj ne bataaya ki mritak ke bhai kii taharir par maa-bete ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya he or unke tikne ke sambhavit thikaanon par dabish di ja rahi he
 Many years after the classic era of actresses like Nargis Dutt and Nutan, the trend of making heroine-oriented films in Bollywood has increased
 ab commercial hindi filmon main nayika pradhan content darshakon ko bhaane laga he
 Alia Bhatt's persuasion is a recent example
 bollywood main aisi filmon kii shuruyaat safataur par vidya baalan kii 'parinita' or 'kahani' se maan sakate hai
 In the last eight years after 2010, the character of women in Hindi films has been seen to be very strong
 vidya se shuru hua bollywood kaa ye nayaa daur philhal aalia bhatta kii raji tak pahunchaa he
 It is being said that in many cases, Alia seems to be ahead of contemporary actresses in many cases
 meghna gulzaar ke nirdesan main bani raji darshakon ko pasand aa rahi he
 The film has grossed more than 51 crores in 6 days
 aalia ko saxes kaa credit diya ja rahaa he
 This is natural because Alia is the main character of Raji and is also the only big face of the film
 vaise, box offis ke lihaaj se 2018 bollywood main femail stars ke liye kai myanon main shandaar mana jayega
 So far this year, four films were seen as female leads
 raji se pehle deepika padukon kii padmavat, anoushka sharma kii pari, vidya baalan kii tumhaari sulu or rani mukherjee kii hitchkee relies hui
 The box office collection of these films was quite good as compared to the cost
 is list main agar deepika kii 'padmavat' ko chhod diya jaae to aalia kii raji saal kii bataur femail lead sabase badi hit film ban chuki he
 51 in the first week
 24 karod kii kamai kar lee he
 There is no major film in Hindi this week, hopefully Alia's persuasion with Hollywood's 'dead Pool' will do good business for the second week as well
 ummid yah bhi ki aalia vidya baalan kii kahani (57 karod), darty pikchar (82 karod) or priyanka chopra kii meri com (56 karod) kaa box offis record bhi tod den
 In front of Alia's persuasion, Padmavat is the only film whose record seems impossible to break
 haalanki film main ranvir singh or shahid kapur kii maujuudagi kii vajah se use critics kaa ek dhada sirf deepika kii film nahin maanata
 There are many more films that were made before 2000
 duusari ore hive, udata punjab jaisi filmon main aalia kii bhoomikaaon ko lekar kuch log unhen maujuuda daur main deepika ke saath sabase badi femail superstar maanane lage hai
 a senior cinema journalist termed such a comparison baseless on the condition of anonymity
 unki raay main bhale hi aalia kii film ne box offis par shridevi, vidya or rani kii pichhali kuch filmon kii kamai ke record ko todaa ho, par mom, kahani, darty pikchar, tumhaari sulu kii femail lead ke aage raji main aalia kaa abhinay kahin nahin thahartaa
 It would be meaningless to compare the classic era with the actresses
 unka maananaa he ki karan johar ke binar kii film hone se raji ko umdaa prachaar kii ranneeti or marketing kaa laabh mila jise aalia ke khate main joda ja rahaa he
 Nothing in front of Watan - the first song released by Alia's film Raazi, the second film critic Ajay Brahmatmaj says - It is also a film by Karan Johar, Vinit Jain and director Meghna Gulzar
 vicky kaushal or film main chote-chote lekin umdaa abhinay karne vaale duusare kalakaaron ke abhinay ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It would be wrong to just give credit to Aaliya for Raji's success
 ise aalia kii film bhi kahana galat hoga
 Ajay asks- If Raji had stars like Shahid Kapoor in place of Vicky Kaushal, would he have called it Alia's film? From 2011 till now, Bollywood's favorite heroine Pradhan Filmpadmavat (2018): Deepika Padukone Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor

 plan banaakar karen taiyaari The Supreme Court has cleared the way for a huge increase in the pension of all private sector employees
 isse nijee kshetra ke karmchaariyon ke pension main kai guna badhat ho jaaegi
 The court upheld the Kerala High Court verdict dismissing the epfo's plea in the case
 kerala hoicourt ne karmchaariyon ko unki puri selary ke hisaab se pension dene kaa aadesh diya gaya tha
 Currently pension is calculated by EPFO based on the basic salary limit of Rs 15,000
 gauratlab he ki karmchaariyon ke basic vetan kaa 12 fisadi hissaa pief main jaataa he or 12 fisadi uske naam se niyokta jamaa karata he
 8 in the company's 12 per cent stake
 33 fisda hissaa pension fund main jaataa he or baaki 3
 In 66 pf
 times of india ke mutabik supreme court ne ab yah rasta saaf kar diya he ki nijee karmchaariyon ke pension kii gananaa puure vetan ke aadhaar par ho
 This will increase the pension of the employees manifold
 EPF pension yaa EPS ek pension skim he, jiske tahat privet sector ke sangathit kshetra main kaam karne vaale karmchaariyon kii naukari ke dauraan basic selleri ke 8
 Money equivalent to 33% (not more than Rs
 1250 monthly) is deposited in this scheme
 iske evaj main, yah karmchaaree ko ritairement ke baad nishchit masik pension pradaan karti he
 How much will the pension increase After the order of the Supreme Court, how much will the pension of private sector employees increase
 ise aap is chart se samaj sakate hai
 Pension (in rupees per month) from the rule of last pay before the year of work, pension after court order 3350,0005,18025,0002550,0003,42519,2252050,0002,10014,285331,00,0005,18050,000251,00,0003 , 42538,571201,00,0002,10028,571 Government of India Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) only manages EPF and pension accounts of all employees
 har aisa santhaan jahaan par 20 yaa isse zyada karmchaaree kaam karte hai, use EPF main hissaa lenaa hota he
 EPS runs in association with this scheme, so every person who becomes a member of the EPF scheme automatically becomes a member of the pension scheme
 EPF yaa EPS main, aise karmchaariyon kaa anshdaan jamaa hona anivaary he, jinka basic vetan + DA 15000 rupee yaa isse adhik hota he
 Employees who get more basic salary than this have the option of adopting or leaving EPF and EPS
 aapke pief khate main niyokta jo paisa daalata he uskaa ek hissaa pension skim ke liye hi istemaal hota he, jabaki aapaki selary se jo paisa katataa he wo puraa kaa puraa ipief skim main chalaa jaataa he
 So if the pension is made according to the entire salary, then the pension of the employees will increase manifold
 isamen nuksaan bas itnaa he ki pension to badhegi, lekin pension fund kii nidhi kam ho jaaegi, kyonki atirikt yogadan ipief main jane kii jagah ipies main jayega
 The EPS was introduced by the Central Government in 1995
 iske tahat niyokta karmchaaree ke 6,500 tak ke mul vetan kaa 8
 There was a rule to put 33 per cent share (maximum Rs
 541 per month) in the pension scheme
 lekin 1 sitambar, 2014 ko ipiefo ne isamen badlaav karte hue 15,000 tak ke mul vetan kaa 8
 33 per cent (maximum Rs
 1,250 per month)
 sarkari naukari vaale karmchaariyon ke liye pension or pief kii vyavastha jipief ke tahat hoti he

 us samay jo kuch bhi hua vah bahut tragedeepurn tha or uske liye dow
 Manmohan Singh also apologized in Parliament while being Prime Minister
 us hinsa ke liye rahul gandhi ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 At that time he must have been 13 or 14 years old
 unhen doshi qaraar nahin diya ja saktaa he
 Significantly, Congress President Rahul Gandhi called the 1984 anti-sikh riots a 'very tragic tragedy' and said that he supports 100 per cent punishment of those involved in any kind of violence against anyone
 purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii unke sikh angrakshak dwaara hatya ke baad 1984 main hue dangon main kareeb 3,000 sikh maare gaye the
 At that time there was a Congress government at the Center
 britain kii do divasiy yatra par aae rahul gandhi ne britain ke saansadon or sthaneey netaaon kii sabha main shuukravaar ko kaha ki yah ghatana traasadee thi or bahut dukhad anubhav tha, lekin unhone isse asahmati jataai ki isamen congress 'shaamil' thi
 The Congress president said, 'I think any violence against anyone is wrong
 bharat main kanoonee prakriya chal rahi he, lekin jahaan tak main maanata hum us samay kuch bhi galat kiya gaya to use sajaa milani chahie or main iskaa 100 fisadi samarthan karata hum
 'he said,' i have no illusions about it
 yah ek traasadee thi, yah ek dukhad anubhav tha
 You say that the Congress party was involved in that, i do not agree with this
 nishchit taur par hinsa hui thi, nishchit taur par vah traasadee thi
 'later when he was asked about the anti-sikh riots during a session at the prestigious London School of Economics, he said,' When (former PM) Manmohan Singh said about it, he spoke for all of us
 jaisaa maine pehle kaha tha ki main hinsa kaa peedit hum or main samajhataa hum ki yah kaisaa lagata he
 In fact, Rahul was referring to the murder of his father and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 by Littetwara
 rahul gandhi ne kaha, 'main is dharti par kisi ke khilaaf kisi bhi tarah kii hinsa ke viruddh hum
 i get upset when i see someone hurt
 isliye main isaki 100 pratishat ninda karata hum or main kisi ke bhi khilaaf kisi bhi tarah kii hinsa main shaamil logon ko sajaa dene ke 100 fisadi samarthan main hum
 He said that those who have not suffered violence feel that violence is the same as seen in films
 congress netaa ne kaha, 'aisa nahin he
 i have seen people die whom i loved so much
 maine us vyakti (prabhakaran) ko bhi marate dekha jisane mere pita ko maaraa tha
 Rahul said, 'when i saw Prabhakaran dead on the banks of Jaffna (sri Lanka), i felt sad for him because i saw his father in his place and saw his children in his place
 isliye jab aap hinsa se peedit hote ho to aap ise samajhate hai, yah puri tarah se aap par asar daalati he

 The government bent on two issues that the government was adamant about
 9 april: paanchvaan dinsahmati shuukravaar ko ban gai thi, lekin anna ne elaan kar diya tha ki ve adhisuchana kii prati dekhne ke baad hi anshan todenge
 The same thing happened

 iske baavjood yah tathy he ki desh ke pratham pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru or yahaan tak ki atal bihari bajpeyi sahit sheersh netaaon ke saath dev anand ke achche sambandh rahe

 # starparivaarawards2017 # redcarpet with Bae @ vikrant8235 a post shared by MONALISA (@aslimonalisa) on May 13, 2017 at 8:00 am PDT china ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki vah pakistan sthit aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana masood ajahar ko sanyukt raashtra kii ore se aatankwaadi ghoshit karne ke nai dilli ke prayaas main avrodh paidaa karne ke apane faisle ko lekar bharat ke saath ‘nikat sampark’ main bana hua he
 Chinese Foreign Ministry statement Hong Kong spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters, "china opposes all forms of terrorism and is keen to increase practical cooperation with all countries
 ’ jab unase bhartiya videsh sachiv es jaishankar ke us bayaan ke bare main poocha gaya ki ajahar ke mudde ko bharat ne china ke samaksh uthaaya he to lee ne kaha, ‘1267 pratibandh samiti main soochibaddh karne ke sandarbh main hamane hameshaa tathyon ke aadhaar par or sanyukt raashtra ke niyamon evam niyaman ke anusaar kadam uthaaya he
 'in contact with India, he said,' We have always kept close contact with all countries including India on this issue
 ’ jaishankar ne is saptaah kaha tha ki bharat ne is mudde ko china ke saath ‘ucch str par’ uthaaya he
 China had given this reason, in fact, last week China stopped the UN sanctions committee from declaring Azhar as a terrorist, saying that the matter does not meet the needs of the Security Council
 ’ yah pehla mauka nahin he jab china ne pakistan ke is aatankwaadi samooh or uske netaaon ko sanyukt raashtra dwaara aatanki ghoshit karne ke bharat ke prayaason ko baadhit kiya he
 India's efforts could not succeed, the United Nations had banned jaish-e-mohammed in 2001, but India's efforts to ban Azhar after the 2008 Mumbai terror attack could not succeed because China, armed with veto powers, had denied Pakistan At the behest, it was not allowed to happen

 sonia gandhi kii congress ab rahul gandhi kii congress main tabdeel ho gayi, to ek bada badlaav data vishleshan ko lekar bhi aayaa he
 First, Rahul modernized the computer department and created the data analysis department and made Praveen Chakraborty, a data scientist from a Mumbai-based company its chairman
 praveen khud tamilnadu ke rahane vaale hai
 After this, the data analysis department has made all the information available to the high command through the data, the party has benefited first in Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh main farji voter suchi ko shuruyaat main isi vibhaag ne pakadaa, jise lekar pradesh adhyaksh kamalnath, jyotiraditya sindhiya or digvijay ne puraa homework karke chunaav ayog main dastak di
 In fact, after collecting the data base of voters from all over the country and matching them, it came to light that in Madhya Pradesh, many voter ids of the same picture have been made
 baad main ye aankada 60 lakh ke kareeb tak pahunch gaya, jabaki rajasthan or chhattisgarh main bade paimaane par aisi gadabadiyaan nahin milin
 Focus not on booth level from above, the data analysis department of Congress believes that booth level analysis is easy through data and strategy is also easy through it
 kareeb 600 matadaataaon kaa vishleshan karke aap chunaav main ranneeti bana sakate hai
 Starting from the booth, a complete analysis of the block, assembly and then the Lok Sabha can be done
 booth main kitne vot badhaane hai, is par bhi target ho saktaa he
 According to the data base, instead of looking at the entire country or a Lok Sabha from above, one has to start from the booth from the bottom
 vot share ko seat main badalane kii jaruratsutron kii maane to data kaa vishleshan bataata he ki congress ko jitna vot miltaa he uske mutabik siten nahin milteen
 Giving the example of Karnataka, it was told how BJP won the seats in 33 seats, winning 104 seats
 data vishleshan team maanati he ki in siton par booth main haar dekh bijepi ne apana vot jedies ko shift karaayaa, jissecongresna jite
 In Old Mysore alone, the BJP lost bail in 30 of the 33 seats, where the contest was between the Congress and the JDS
 isliye congress or baaki vipakshi dalon kii boothwaar vishleshan ke maddenjar is baat kaa khaasaa khyaal rakhana chahie
 Apart from this, it is also important how the Congress with the highest vote share of about 38 percent was reduced to 78 seats
 data team kaa maananaa he ki data kaa vishleshan bataata he ki aisa hi hona tha
 How to convert the vote into as many seats as possible, keeping an eye on the points found from the analysis of booth level data
 is babat booth str par data team ne suzav bhi die hai, jo puri tarah data vishleshan par hi aadhaarit hai
 Shiftdata team has got another shocking disclosure about Kairana, BJP gets 8% vote of Congress in Kairana
 uske mutabik, mahagathbandhan kaa ummidavaar hone par kairana main congress kaa 8 fisad vot bijepi chalaa gaya, isiliye bijepi sirf 44 hazaar ke kareeb maton se haari
 This data of the data team also raises questions about the strategy of a candidate of the opposition, a seat of Congress
 darasal, data vishleshan bataata he qi kai aisi siten milti hai jahaan congress nahin ladi to uske vot kaa kuch pratishat bijepi ko shift ho saktaa he
 Therefore, alliances should be done under strategy rather than direct alliances
 data team 2009 se lekar ab tak ke sabhi chote-bade chunaav kaa vishleshan kiya he
 According to this, just as the Congress has fallen from 206 in 2009 to 44 in 2014, in the same way data analysis of small and big elections since 2014 shows that the BJP has come down from 282 to 201 today and this trend If it can, it will be able to bring 160 seats in 2019
 vahiin congress aahista aahista 2019 main 140 ke kareeb hogi
 The data team has analyzed the Congress in three ways
 pehla, jahaan congress or endie main muqabla he
 Second, where the Congress is competing against the NDA as a major partner in the alliance and third, where the Congress is competing against the NDA in the coalition as the junior partner
 data ke mutabik, pehle do main congress 120 ke kareeb jitati dikhti he, to vahiin tisare main 20 siten uske khate main aati dikh rahi hai
 Overall, the entry of data in politics is old, but Rahul will at least give a further edge to the strategy of confronting Modi in 2019, at least at the national level in the Congress
 haan, dilachasp ye he ki rahul kii siyasat main data kitna haaavee hota he, ye ghate kaa sauda hota he yaa phaayde kaa

 Vijay Bahuguna told 'aaj Tak' that they do not interfere in each other's politics but they will explain to the sister that the future of the Congress is bleak, the Congress is sinking under Rahul's leadership
 'sirf bijepi hi he vikalp'vijay bahuguna bole ki ve aaj raat apni bahan se milenge, unhen samajhaayenge ki congress kaa bhavishya kaise andhere main he
 Today, only BJP is the option
 unhone aage kaha 'main to jis congressi se miltaa hum, ye baat kahata hum
 Bahuguna said that his and sister's politics have been in different states
 lekin ve donon ek-duusare kii raajnneeti main dakhal nahin dete hai
 He told his sister-in-law Bahuguna that under which circumstances he left the Congress and joined the BJP
 sonia ke netritv main tha balancerahul gandhi se naaraaz vijay bahuguna bole ki unke or bahane ke bich madhur sambandh hai
 He said that there is balance under the leadership of Sonia, but Rahul does not keep the balance, but appears to be supporting a faction himself
 aise main party kaa bura haal to hona hi he
 Explain that in June this year, he left the Congress and joined the BJP
 bahuguna ke saath uttarakhand ke or 8 congress ke baagi vidhayakon ne bhi bijepi kaa haath thama tha
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav reassigned him the charge of Meerut district after senior minister Azam Khan's displeasure and in some way challenged his removal from the post of minister
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki mukhyamantri ne khan ko pun: meerut kaa prabharee mantri banane kaa nirnay kiya he
 Sources said that the decision to this effect was taken after the intervention of SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav
 ullekhneey he ki meerut ke prabharee mantri pad se hathaaye jane se khafa sapa ke varisht netaa ajam khan ne pradesh ke mukhyamantri ko patr likhakar kaha ki agar ve unhen mantri ke rup main ayogymante hai to unhen cabinet mantri ke pad se hataa den
 According to SP sources, the state's Urban Development Minister Khan has said in a letter sent to the state Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav that if he is not satisfied with his work, he should be removed from the post
 party sutron ne bataaya tha ki meerut jile kaa prabhaar waapas le liye jane ke baad khan ne khud ko gajiabad tathaa mujffarnagar jilon ke prabharee mantri kii jimmedaari se bhi alag kar liya tha
 Describing his removal from the post of in-charge of Meerut as inappropriate, Khan said in Delhi that he had written a letter to the chief minister but denied that he had offered to resign
 unhone kaha ki main aisa kuch bhi kaise kah saktaa hum jo maine kiya hi nahin
 i am not here to weaken the government
 vastav main jo is tarah ke samvaad ko media main li kar rahe hai, vahiin sarkaar ko kamjor kar rahe hai
 Khan had asked the Chief Minister in the letter to give charge of these two districts to a minister who is more capable than them
 gauratlab he ki ajam khan se meerut kaa prabhaar lekar panchayat raaj mantri balram yadav ko saunpa gaya tha, jabaki khan ko meerut ke badale pilibhit ke prabharee mantri kii jimmedaari saunpi gayithi
 However, earlier in the day, Chief Minister Akhilesh had said in Kanpur that news of Khan's displeasure was exaggerated by newspapers and he had no displeasure with the government

 In the infiltration, 50 terrorists, Jaish leader Masood Azhar has already sent his relatives to spread terror in Kashmir, but the security forces have eliminated them

 Masood Azhar has sent terrorists to Kashmir several times to avenge the death of these terrorists but all were piled into the encounter of the security forces during Operation All Out

 shivasena saansad sanjay raut ne somvaar ko lakhanu main uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath se mulaakaat kii
 Shiv Sena MP Raut, a constituent of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), discussed the visit of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and party mps to Ayodhya on June 16 during a meeting with CM Yogi
 gauratlab he ki uddhav thakare kaa party ke saansadon ke saath 16 june ko ayodhya pahunchane kaa kaarykram he
 The Shiv Sena supremo visited Ayodhya in November even before the Lok Sabha elections
 ab, jabaki vah ek or chunaav ke muhane par khadey hai, unhone ek baar phir ayodhya kaa rukh kar liya he
 During his visit in November, Thackeray had shown a strong attitude against the central government from the platform of the Dharma Sansad in Ayodhya, saying that he had come to Ayodhya to know the date of its construction, not to take credit for the Ram temple
 kumbhakarni nidra main so rahi sarkaar ko jagaane ko apni ayodhya yatra kaa uddeshy bataate hue kaha tha ki puure desh ko ram mandir ke nirmaan kaa intjaar he
 Uddhav based the statement of CM Yogi that he said that there was, and will be, a temple there
 lekin hamaari dharna he ki yadi mandir he, to vah dikhnaa bhi chahie
 Thackeray then strongly criticized the BJP for raising the temple issue only at the time of elections and for not making any efforts thereafter
 tab loksabhaa, ab maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav se pehle ayodhya ja rahe uddhavyodhya kaa daura kar hameshaa aane kaa vaada karne vaale shivasena pramukh jab aae the, loksabhaa chunaav main kuch maheenon kaa samay shesh tha
 Now that he is going to Ayodhya once again, Maharashtra assembly elections are going to be held in a few months, in such a situation political implications of Uddhav's journey are also being taken out
 koi ise hard hindootv ke puraane trek par shivasena kii vaapasi kii kavayad bataa rahaa he, to koi maharashtra main kho chuki bade bhai kii bhoomika waapas paane kii chatapataahat
 Significantly, Shiv Sena is also considered to be active in the Ram temple movement
 hindutv kii lahar par savaar shivasena ko maharashtra main iskaa laabh bhi mila tha
 The party emerged strongly in the politics of Maharashtra
 BJP has 104, congress-jds may have majority to form the govt, politics in the state has become dirty
 The way power is being misused to put pressure on mlas, use of ED, IT & other agencies & claims of Rs 100 Cr, all this has become a face of our democracy globally: Sanjay Raut pic

 Congress leader Shashi Tharoor is adept at using heavy words in the English language, but he stuttered when he tried to step in the field of Urdu poetry
 darasal,tharur (shashi Tharoor) ne twitor par teen sher likhe jo yun the - 'khuda kii mohabbat ko fanaa koun karegaa? sabhi bande nek hon to gunaah koun karegaa? i khuda mere doston ko salaamat rakhana, varanaa meri salaamati kii dua koun karegaa or rakhana mere dushmano ko bhi mahafooz, varanaa meri tere paas aane kii dua koun karegaa
 'tharoor further wrote that the 220th anniversary of Mirza Ghalib
 kitne mahaan sher
 Who will make God fall in love? sabhi bande nek hon to gunaah koun karegaa? Oh god keep my friends safe varanaa meri salaamati kii dua koun karegaa And keep my enemies safe too varanaa meri tere paas aane kii dua koun karegaa
 
 
 !!! Mirza Ghalib's 220th birthday
 So many great lines
 
 
 
 However neither was Mirza Ghalib's anniversary nor were these lions theirs
 iske baad tamaam logon ne twit kar shashi tharur (shashi Tharoor) ko isaki jaankaree di, jinamein javed akhtar bhi shaamil the
 Javed Akhtar tweeted and said, 'shashi ji, never trust anyone who has given you these lines
 saafe he ki kisi ne ye line aapke zakire main is maqasad se rakh deen taaki aapaki saahitiyik saakh ko nuqasaan pahunche
 'shashi ji, who ever has given you these lines should never be trusted again
 It is obvious that some one had planted these lines in your repertoire to sabotage you literary credibility 
 However, Shashi Tharoor later realizes his mistake and apologizes
 tharur ne twit kar kaha 'gaalib mere pasandida hai, lekin aaj unka janmdin nahin he
 i was given incorrect information
 ' tharur ne aage apane twit main javed akhtar (javed Akhtar) ko tag karte huelikha, 'javed akhtar or anya doston kaa shukriya jinhone mujhemeri galati kaa ehsaas karavaaya
 'thanks to @javedakhtarjadu & other friends, i realize I've been had
 The lines are not Ghalib's
 Just as every clever quote is attributed to Winston Churchill even if he never said it, so it seems that whenever people like a shayari, they credit Ghalib for it! Apologies
 shashi tharur ne kaha ki jis tarah har acha kot winston churchill kaa bataaya jaataa he, bhale hi unhone ise nahin kaha hothik usee tarah jab logon ko koi shaayari pasand aa jaati he to isko gaalib se jod dete hai
 I'm sorry bataa den ki shashi tharur ke is twit ke jawaab main kai or logon ne bhi gaalib ke naam se galat shaayari saajha kii
 Javed Akhtar informed some Twitter users about this

 Punjab is not taking the name of dissent in Congress
 pehle captain amarinder singh or pratap singh bajva ke bich chal rahi cold war ko rahul gandhi ne khud dakhal dekar kisi tarah khatm karavaaya tha or ab punjab congress adhyaksh captain amarinder singh or punjab main party ke dalit netaa or rajyasabha saansad shamsher singh dulo ke bich jubaani jang chhid gai he
 Actually, there has been a feud between the Dalit faces of Punjab Congress Hans Raj Hans and Shamsher Singh Dulo for a long time and Hans Raj Hans is considered very close to Captain Amarinder Singh
 darasal captain amarinder singh ne ishaaron-ishaaron main shamsher singh dulo ko naseehat di thi ki party ke senior netaaon ko umr ke aadhaar par siyasat chhod deni chahie
 At the same time, following the statement of Captain Amarinder Singh, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Shamsher Singh Dulo attacked Captain Amarinder Singh and Hans Raj Hans
 dulo ne kaha ki captain mere se 10 saal bade hai, isliye wo pehle siyasat choden
 i will also leave after this
 rahi baat hans kii to unhen badalon ne sajeesh ke tahat congress main bheja he taaki party ko dophaad kar chunaav main nuksaan pahunchaa saken
 Dulo has responded to the Captain's statement in which the Captain had said, Dulo should now give new party leaders a chance to move forward as well
 yah sab kuch doolo or hans ke bich pichley dinon hue takaraav kaa nateeja mana ja rahaa he
 At the same time, senior leaders of Punjab Congress are engaged in putting a curtain on this gap going on in the Congress
 congress ke senior leader sunil jakhad ne kaha ki party main koi antarkalah yaa manmutav nahin he or congress party punjab kii donon vipakshi partiyon aam aadmi party or akali-bijepi gathbandhan ko haraakar punjab main sarkaar banaaegi
 At the same time, this intertwining in the Congress has given the Akali Dal a chance to attack the Congress
 akali dal ke senior leader manjinder singh sirsa ne chutki lete hue kaha ki pehle congress apni party ke andruni jhagade ko to sulajhaa le phir akali-bijepi gathbandhan ko patkhni dene kii baat karen
 For the last 10 years, Congress, which is away from power in Punjab, is hopeful that they will be able to form a government in Punjab and this is the reason why the Congress high command is constantly trying to unite the party leaders in Punjab by quitting the feud but The way the infighting of the party is increasing daily, it does not seem that the leader of the Punjab Congress should leave his pride even at the behest of his high command

 chote parde ke dhamaakedaar sho nagin 3 main jald hi lead actress koun hoga, is sawaal par suspence khatm hone vaala he
 a few days ago Ekta Kapoor opened the secret that this time there will be not one or two serpent in the serial
 ashaka kii wedding main 'nagin' ke saath hua ye, kya jald karengi boyfriend se shadimedia main chali rahi khabaron kii maane to mauni roy kii jagah nagin ke kirdaar main 'ye hai mohabbatein' kii actress anita hasanandani or 'kubul he' fame actress surabhi jyoti najar aane vaali hai
 It is reported that Karanvir Bohra has been approached for the male role
 aapako bataa den ki nagin ke kirdaar ke liye pehle do logon kaa naam saamne aa rahaa tha, jiname sanjeeda shaikh or crystal disuja kaa naam sabase pehle tha
 Mouni Roy will not be seen in Naagin 3, Ekta Kapoor showed Outside Journey, Mouni Roy played the lead in this hit show of TV world
 lekin actress mauni ne sho ko by-by kah diya he
 The reason for his departure from this show is his busy schedule
 aapako bataa den ki mauni bade parde par actor akshay kumaar ke saath film gold main najar aaengi
 In this, information about his character is not available yet
 mauni apni film se free hone ke baad web siries main acting karti najar aane vaali hai
 For a long time, Android's market share worldwide has been much higher than any other mobile operating system
 lekin kya ab isaki monopali khatm hone vaali he? aisa isliye kaha ja rahaa he, kyonki fasebuk ek nae oparating system par kaam kar rahaa he
 According to a report by The Information, Facebook is building an operating system in association with Microsoft veteran Mark Lukowski
 gauratlab he ki mark lukovski ne Windows NT oparating system banane main ahm role play kiya he
 The call of the new operating system also comes from this
 The Verge kii ek report ke mutabik Facebook ke AR or VR heads main se ek ficasal karkapetric ne kaha he, 'mumkin he ki fasebuk ke future hardware ke liye google software kii jarurat nahin hogi, isaki vajah se fasebuk ke hardware par google kaa control kam yaa puri tarah se khatm kiya ja saktaa he'di information kii report main fasebuk ke hardware head andryu basworth ke hawaale se bataaya gaya he ki company ko aisa nahin lagata he ki wo marketspls yaa pratidwandiyon par bharosa kar sakati he or isliye hi company ye kaam khud se karnaa chaahati he
 This report also shows that the company can bring future operating systems like Apple and Google
 isse pehle bhi bloomberg or FT kii report main kaha gaya tha ki company custom chip hardware or wais assistant par kaam kar rahi he
 It is not that Facebook has not made the operating system before, but when the company tried to make its operating system, it was beaten at that time

 The apex court said that the facts and circumstances in Aruna's case show from the medical evidence and other material that there is no need to grant euthanasia to the victim
 peeth ne haalanki kaha ki kyonki vartmaan main desh main ichhamrityu par koi koi kanoon nahin he, lekin maranasann haalat vaale rogi ko ‘‘asaadhaaran maamalon main pasive yuthensia diya ja saktaa he
 The bench clarified that until Parliament enacts a law, its decision will continue to apply to both methods of euthanasia (active and passive euthanasia)
 ab 60 saal kii ho chuki aruna par mumbai ke king edward memorial aspataal main 27 navambar 1973 ko aspataal ke hi ek karmchaaree ne barbar tareeke se hamalaa kiya tha
 Writer Pinky Virani filed a petition for euthanasia for Aruna
 unhone nyaayalay ko bataaya ki aspataal ke ek safaikarmi ne aruna kii gardan main kute kii chen lapetakar ise jhatak diya, jisase vah coma main chali gai
 According to the petition, the employee tried to rape the victim, but after learning that she was menstruating, she raped the nurse unnaturally
 aruna virodh nahin kar paae, isliye aaropee ne uski gardan se chen lapetakar use jhatak diya
 He escaped from the scene after committing the heinous crime
 viraani ne kaha ki galaa ghonte jane se aruna ke mastishk ko oxigen kii aapurti band ho gai or uskaa cartex kshatigrast ho gaya
 Injury to the cervical cord as well as internal injury to the brain tubes
 yachikakarta ke anusaar ghatana ke baad pichley 37 saal main aruna kaa vajan bahut kam ho gaya he or uski haddiyaan charmara gai hai
 He has got an infection in his skin due to lying in bed
 uski kalaaiyaan andar kii ore mud gai hai, daant nasht ho chuke hai or use keval matha hua bhojan diya ja saktaa he
 He said that Aruna is constantly in a state of unconsciousness
 uskaa mastishk asal main mrit ho chukaa he or use duniya kii koi sud nahin he
 The petitioner sought euthanasia for Aruna, stating that she could neither hear nor see nor express herself in any way
 peeth ne is mudde par vibhinn pakshon ke tark sunne ke baad apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Those who argued on the controversial issue of allowing euthanasia included Advocate General GE Vahanvati, counsel for the court TR Andhyarujina Hospital, Ballabh Sisodia and petitioner Virani, Shekhar Nafade
 jirah ke dauraan sarkaar ne yah rukh apanaaya ki kanoonee yaa sanvaidhanik taur ichhamrityu kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 Sisodia opposed the petition saying that the hospital staff, especially the doctors and nurses, have been taking very good care of Aruna for the last 37 years and they are against the urge to kill her

 During the ongoing discussion in the Rajya Sabha on the Lokpal Bill which has been passed in the Lok Sabha, the ruling and the opposition fiercely presented their arguments
 vipaksh ne vidheyak ko 'sanvaidhanik rup se kamjor' bataaya
 At the same time, the government accused the main opposition party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of making excuses for not passing the bill
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue kaha ki vidheyak kamjor he lekin sadan ko ek prabhavi lokapal vidheyak paarit kiye bagaiyr apane kadam peeche nahin khinchne chahie
 At the same time, Congress's Abhishek Manu Singhvi answered Jaitley's questions
 singhvi ne bhaajapa par aarope lagaaya ki vah vidheyak ko paarit na karaane ke liye bahanebaaji kar rahi he
 Satish Chandra Mishra of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) said that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) should not be under the government
 jabaki marxvaadi communist party (makapa) ke netaa seetaram yechuri ne pesh vidheyak ko kamjor bataaya
 The vote will be divided after discussion on the bill giving the form of Lokpal at the Center and the Lokayukta institution in the states
 gyaat ho ki 243 sadasyon vaale sadan main congress or uske sahyogiyon kii sankhya 92 he, jabaki vidheyak paarit karaane ke liye sarkaar ko 122 sadasyon kaa samarthan chahie
 The government hopes that the BSP and SP will cooperate in passing the bill
 charchaa ke dauraan jetali ne kaha ki yah vidheyak 'sanvaidhanik tabaahi' laaegaa
 He objected to the provision of minority quota in the Bill and the exclusion of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) from the purview of the Lokpal
 jetali ne sarkaar se kaha ki yadi vah vidheyak ko ucch sadan main paarit karana chaahati he to use bhaajapa ke sanshodhano ko sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 Jaitley questioned every part of the bill and said that the government has created an ombudsman which is weak in terms of constitutional norms
 unhone kaha ki vidheyak kaa vah praavdhaan jo rajyon ko centre sarkaar ke adarsh par lokayuktaon kii niyukti anivaary banaata he, spasht nahin he or isse centre or rajya ke adhikaar ek-duusare se takaraayenge
 At the same time, Singhvi dismissed Jaitley's allegations and asked that the fundamental question is whether you want to pass the Lokpal Bill or not? sadan main sarkaar kaa paksh rakhte hue singhvi ne bhaajapa kaa is mudde par rukh spasht nahin hone kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Singhvi said, "the BJP is stuck in the bill in a critical situation and is saying that it wants a strong and comprehensive bill
 vah is sthiti ko vidheyak ko paas nahin karaane ke liye bahaane ke rup main istemaal kar rahi he
 "he said," If you do not want to pass the bill, do so and show courage to leave the pretext
 " The Congress leader said, "CBI is a 70-year-old institution

 Javed went to jail as a teenager and is now 35 years old
 peshey se javed tivi maikenic hai
 Javed said his pain in this way - 'now there are buildings instead of small houses
 asthai dukaanon kii jagah ab proper market le chuke hai
 People who used to ride bicycles today have motorcycles and those who used to ride motorcycles at that time have taken four wheels
 mujhe lagata he ki main bahut peeche rah gaya
 'javed has still not recovered from that shock, Javed, who worked as a TV mechanic since he got out of jail, said that even today his past does not let him live peacefully
 unhen lagata he ki bharat or pakistan ke bich lavastory kaa wo sahi samay nahin tha
 According to Javed, 'today i realize that when i was caught by the police in 2002, the relationship between India and Pakistan was quite bad
 kargil yuddh kuch samay pehle hi khatm hua tha
 Today i think i should not have called that girl at that time
 mujhe shaq ke aadhaar par pakadaa gaya tha
 At that time very few people used to call Pakistan
 'kaise shuru hui thi 'prem-kahani'
 
 
 On the one hand in 1999, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Bajpai was trying to make peace between the two countries, on the other hand Pakistan was ready to stab in the back of India
 pradhanmantri or desh ke tamaam logon kii tarah javed va uske parivaar ko bhi nahin andaja tha ki kargil main kya hone vaala he
 Seeing the improving relations between the two countries, Javed and his family planned to visit Pakistan to meet their relatives
 isi dauraan javed ne pakistan main apane rishtedaar ke ghar pehla phone kol kiya tha
 And Mobina received the phone
 javed ne us samay ko yaad karte hue kaha- 'jab maine usase baat kii to mujhe laga wo mere saamne he or main uske saath milakar baat kar rahaa hum
 After that i wanted to go to Pakistan
 us phone kol ke kareeb ek-dedh maheene baad main pakistan gaya bhi tha
 That's where i met him for the first time
 maine jo sochaa to wo usase bhi bahut zyada khubasurat thi
 'his family did not agree
 
 
 dhai maheene javed karachi main rahaa or vahiin un donon ke bich pyaar kii shuruyaat hui
 At the same time, tension between Kargil between the two countries increased javed karachi se rampur laut rahaa tha to unhone mobina se vaada kiya tha ki wo use phone karata rahegaa
 Javed Rampur returned but his relationship with Mobina grew stronger
 donon phone par baaten karte the or khat bhi likhaa karte the
 In 2001, Javed went to Karachi for the second time and this time he wanted to marry Mobina and bring her to Rampur, but Mobina's family did not agree
 sitambar 2002 main hameshaa ke liye badal gai javed kii jindagijaved ne bataaya- 'wo apni beti ko bharat nahin jane dena chaahate the
 i could not leave my family in Rampur but i did not lose courage
 ' sitambar 2002 tak donon ke bich lagaataar phone par baat hoti rahi lekin isi maheene kii ek taarikh aisi ai jisane javed kii jindagi hameshaa ke liye badal daali
 Javed says- 'A Tata Sumo came and i was taken in and taken away
 ye sabakuch bahut jaldi main hua
 i had no idea what was happening to me
 jab main is jatke se ubra to maine dekha ki mere saath car main wo log bhi hai jo meri dukaan par client ke taur par aae the
 He was in plain clothes but had weapons
 jab tak unhone meraa cheharaa nahin dhakaa nahin tha maine paaya ki main gajiabad main hum uske baad unhone meraa cheharaa cover kar diya
 'javed would never have imagined this result of love
 yaheen se javed kii jindagi kaa kaala panna shuru ho gaya
 Javed told- 'he continued torturing me for 3 days
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki wo log mujhe jaan se maarna chaahate the
 He then wrote something on the diary and took my thumb impression
 'javed ke khilaaf IPC kii dharaaen 121, 121 a or 123 lagaai gayi
 According to Javed's lawyer Jalalaluddin Khan, 'as evidence he had letters written by Javed which were sent to Pakistan
 iske alaava photo, haath se bana hua nakshaa tha
 He claimed that Javed used to give information about army movement to Pakistan through fax message
 wo kaksha chaar tak padhaa hua tha or is maamle main kuch nahin kar saktaa tha
 'A father's pain
 
 
 javed kaa parivaar bhi sadame main aa chukaa tha
 Javed's father Mohammad Shafiq told- 'when those people took him for the first time, we kept crying for 5 days
 rampur main aisa koi nahin tha jo mujhe nahin jaanata tha
 i was ashamed that my son was facing such serious allegations
 'javed ke do doston ko bhi rampur se pakadaa gaya tha
 a month and a half after Javed's arrest, he was punished
 iske baad javed is daldal main dhansata chalaa gaya
 Javed told- 'I used to write' j 'at the end of my letter and she used to write' m '
 police ko aisa laga ki ham kodeward main khufia jaankaree share kar rahe the
 Javed's father says- "to love is not a crime, but it is a crime for my son because he loved a Pakistani girl
" 'saadhe gyaarah saal main bahut peeche chhot gaya javed
 
 
 11
 5 saal jail main bitaane ke baad use sabooton kii kami ke chalate chhod diya gaya
 But when Javed returned to Rampur, everything had changed
 isi saal janvari main jail se reeha hue javed kehete hai- 'mujhe abhi bhi pyaar par puraa bharosa he
 It is very important for me to think about him
 lekin meri aatma mar chuki he
 i do not want to go to Pakistan
 or na hi usko phone karne ke bare main soch saktaa hum
 'even though Javed has come out of jail today, his life is no longer the same as before

 isi kram main sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir main kaam kar rahe sanghathan jamaat-e-islamic par 5 saal tak ke liye pratibandh laga diya he
 The Home Ministry has taken this decision after the Cabinet Committee on Security
 aise main aapke liye yah jaananaa dilachasp he ki aakhir jamaat-e-islamic (jammu-kashmir) kya he or is sanghathan kii ore se aisa kya kaam kiya jaataa he ki sarkaar ko is par bain lagaana padaa
 
 
 Before telling about jamaat-e-islami (jammu and Kashmir), let us tell you where the foundation of it was
 bataa den ki aazaadee se pehle saal 1941 main ek sanghathan kaa gathan kiya gaya, jiskaa naam jamaat-e-islamic tha
 The jamaat-e-islami was formed by Maulana Abul Ala Maududi, an Islamic theologian and worked on the ideology of Islam
 haalanki aazaadee ke baad yah kai alag-alag sanghathanon main bant gaya, jisamen jamaat-e-islamic pakistan or jamaat-e-islamic hind shaamil he
 However, influenced by jamaat-e-islami, many more organizations were formed, including jamaat-e-islami Bangladesh, Kashmir, Britain and Afghanistan
 jamaat-e-islamic partiyaan anya muslim samoohon ke saath antarrashtriya str par sambandh banaae rakhti hai
 What is the jamaat-e-islami (jammu and Kashmir) jamaat-e-islami (jammu and Kashmir) Valley politics has an important role and from the year 1971 it entered active politics
 pehle chunaav main ek bhi seat hasil nahin karne ke baad aage ke chunaav main acha pradarshan kiya or jammu-kashmir kii raajnneeti main ahm jagah banaai
 However, it is now considered the main responsible organization for the spread of separatist ideology and terrorist mentality in Jammu and Kashmir
 mana jaataa he ki yah aatanki sanghathan hijbul mujahidin kaa dahinaa haath he or hijbul mujahidin ko jamaat-e-islamic jammu kashmir ne hi khadaa kiya he
 The Hizbul Mujahideen provided all assistance to this organization
 bataa den ki isse pehle bhi do baar is sanghathan ko bain kiya ja chukaa he
 For the first time, this organization was banned for two years in 1975 by the Jammu and Kashmir government, while the second time it was banned by the Central Government in 1990
 wo bain disambar 1993 tak jari rahaa tha
 This organization is different from the jamaat-e-islami Hind
 It is a completely different organization from the jamaat-e-islami Hind
 iskaa us sanghathan se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 In the year 1953, jamaat-e-islami also made its own constitution
 jamaat-e-islamic (jammu-kashmir) ghati main chunaav ladata he, lekin jamaat-e-islamic hind aisa sanghathan he jo welfare ke liye kaam karata he
 The jamaat-e-islami has also done many works related to health and education in the country of Hind
 kyon laga bain?jamaat-e-islamic jammu kashmir main algaavvaadi vichaardhaara evam aatankwaadi maansikta ke prasar ke liye pramukh jimmedaar sanghathan he
 According to the information received from the sources of the Home Ministry, the jamaat-e-islami was working to trend, fund them, give asylum, provide logistic etc
 ise jamaat-e-islamic jammu kashmir kaa militant wing mana jaataa he
 At the same time, it is considered responsible for terrorist incidents
 apni algaavvaadi vichaardhaara or pakistani agenda ke tahat kashmir ghati main kaam karata he
 This organization ideologically supports separatist, terrorist elements
 unki raashtra virdohi gatividhiyon main bhi bharpoor madad detaa rahaa he
 It has also been reported that it is trying to establish an independent Islamic state based on a different religion from India
 jamaat-e-islamic kii in harkaton kii vajahon se hi usapar bain lagane kaa kadam uthaaya gaya he
