 com / 7tchs1h2vp 6 farvari ko slap de par vishembhi tak aapane yahi suna hoga ki kisi ko thappad maarane se kaam bighad jaataa he
 But it is not so
 kai baar thappad maarna acha bhi hota he
 Psychoanalysts believe that if you are very angry at someone
 itnaa ki aap use jaan se maarane kii soch rahe hai to use sirf ek tamaacha jad dijie aapkaa sara gussa nikal jayega
 But yes don't try it on your boss or else your job will be in danger
 manovishaleshak doctor medha gore ne bataaya, ‘‘gar aap kisi se is had tak naaraaz hai ki uski shakl tak dekhnaa nahin chaahate to use ek thappad maar lijie aapkaa gussa turant kam ho jayega
 Actually, whenever we get angry, a certain type of hormone starts coming out in our body
 vah hormone hamaare sharir main urja ke str ko badhaata he jisase hamaare sharir main garmi badhati he or hamaara gussa zyada tej hota jaataa he
 But when we slap someone, a large part of our body energy which was increasing anger goes into slapping
 isi kaaran hamaara gussa dhire-dhire kam hone lagata he
 Psychoanalyst Dr
 Sanjeev Tyagi says, "our most dangerous step when angry is to physically harm someone and when you physically harm him, your mind cannot think of anything and your anger itself -by himself begins to calm down
 sirf itnaa hi nahin aapako ek tarah kaa maansik santosh hone lagata he ki maine use thappad maaraa
 This mental satisfaction melts your inner anger
 aapke bheetar gusse ko badha rahe hormone kaa nikalnaa kam ho jaataa he or gussa shant hone lagata he
 'doctor Gore says,' Slapping does not eliminate anger, but always use this remedy
 yah gussa nikaalane kaa antim upaay he
 If you get angry and slap on some small thing then the thing will get worse
 isliye koshish karen ki ise aise kisi vakt istemaal karen jab aapke man main gusse ke badale hinsa kii bhaavana jag rahi ho yani kisi bhi saamaanya gusse ke liye iskaa istemaal bilkul na karen
 'doctor Tyagi says,' When we are angry, the speed of blood circulation within us increases
 agar us vakt ham use niyantrit kar saken to gussa apane aap nikal jayega
 Angry slapping someone does the same thing
 vah hamaare sharir ke rakt sanchaar kii raftaar ko kam kar detaa he or hamaara gussa shant ho jaataa he
 'anger is harmful to all
 isliye kabhi bhi zyada der gusse main nahin rahanaa chahie
 But one should not always use a slap to end the anger, because the work one can love cannot slap
 isliye jab tak aapkaa gussa charam sthiti main na ho aap thappad kaa istemaal na karen to behatar hoga

 bihari babu ko " khamosh" karo
 
 
 That is to say, some leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party Yuva Morcha who put a banner on Patna's JP Golambhar on Thursday formally demanded action against senior party leader and MP from Patna Sahib, Shatrughan Sinha
 jo binar-poster lagaaya gaya usamen likhaa tha ki ham kaaryakartaaon kii yahi maang he ki shatrughna sinha ko bhi "khamosh" kiya jaae
 And a line was also added in it that after Kirti Azad it is Shatrughan Sinha's turn
 or ye bhi sanyog rahaa ki patna shahar se gaayab rahane ke liye hameshaa charchaa main rahane vaale bihari babu guuruuvaar ko patna main hi the or jab patrakaron ne unase poocha to unka jawaab tha "jab aap raajnneeti main aate hai to pathar aapke upar phenkaa jaataa he lekin ye party kii taraf se aadhikarik rup se lagaaya gaya poster nahin ho saktaa or unhone ulate media waalon ko salaah di ki poster lagane vaale ke bare main thodi tahakikat kar len ki wo party main hai yaa nahin 
 
 or puraa maamla publicity paane ke liye to nahin kiya ja rahaa
 When he was asked about the statement of Bharatiya Janata Party leaders in which he claimed that Jungle Raj has returned to Bihar, Bihari Babu's reply was "silent"
 
 
 tippaniyan It was also a coincidence that while all this drama was going on, all the senior leaders of Bihar BJP were sitting on a dharna against the state government outside the party office
 
 
 darasal bihar vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa, prem kumaar ne 24 ghante kaa anshan kiya he jiske samarthan main puri party ke sabhi varisht netaa dharna sthal par pahunche
 But neither did he feel the need to call Bihari Babu and neither did Shatrughan Sinha perform the formalities of joining the dharna despite being in Patna
 haalanki patna shahar main isse pehle bhi bihari babu ke khilaaf poster lagate rahe hai, lekin un poster binar main logon kii shikaayat is baat par rahati thi ki wo apane sansadeey kshetra se gaayab rahete hai
 However, people close to him say that it is probably not possible to expect such banner posters to soften their tone and in the coming days it would not be surprising if they increase the number of such statements which increases the party's troubles

 In fact, the Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Legislative Assembly, Prem Kumar, has gone on a 24-hour hunger strike in support of which all senior leaders of the entire party reached the dharna site
 lekin na unhone bihari babu ko bulaane kii jarurat samajhi or na shatrughna sinha ne patna main hone ke baavjood dharna main shaamil hone kii aupchaarikta nibhaai
 Although there have been posters against Bihari Babu in Patna city earlier also, people in those poster banners used to complain that they are missing from their parliamentary constituency
 haalanki unke najdiki logon kaa kahana he ki aise binar poster se unke tevar naram hone kii ummid rakhana shaayad sambhav nahin or aane vaale dinon main wo aise bayanon kii sankhya jisase party kii pareshaani badhati ho agar badha den to aashcharya nahin hoga

 krishna urf james band laga dilli police ke haath007 likhi shart pahan detaa tha vaardaat ko anjamo jab sadakon par lutpaat karne nikalataa tha to wo 007 likhi shart pahan letaa tha
 He considered it his lucky shirt, but on the 12th, Krishna aka James Bond's luck did not work and he was arrested with his lucky shirt
 maamla dilli ke dwarka jile kaa he
 According to the police, a team was formed which was keeping an eye on the miscreants who are involved in street crime and escaped by pouncing between people during the day
 police kii is team ko pataa laga ki cocarola ilaake main do badmaash lut ke iraade se pahunche hue hai
 After this, the police immediately took custody of both of them and examined them, then they got indigenous molds from them
 dono main se ek ne 007 likhi shart pahan rakhi thi
 According to the police, in addition to robbery on Krishna alias James Bond, a case of murder and attempted murder is also registered
 iske alaava iske saathi vinod urf tony ke khilaaf bhi kai cese darj hai
 Police say that Krishna aka Tony got involved in the robbery from a young age
 ise mahangi cigarette or sharaab kii lat lag gai thi
 In order to bully the people in the area, it named itself James Bond and had 007 written on its shirt
 logon se kahata tha ki use sirf james band kahkar hi bulaayaa karen
 The special thing is that whenever he went out to carry out an incident, he used to wear only shirt written on 007
 krishna apni is shart ko behad lucky maanata tha
 It seemed that he would never be caught in this shirt, but on September 12, Krishna's luck did not work and he was caught by the police
 film kaa naam: laila majanudiarector: sajid aleestaracast: avinaash tiwari, tripti dimri, parmit sethi, sumit kaul, mir sarvakvadhi: 2 ghanta 20 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 2 stardiarector sajid ali ne kuch saal pehle jon abraham ke production main film 'bananaa' diarect kii thi
 However, the film is yet to release
 ab sajid ne kashmir ke becoground par aadhaarit filmlaila majanuka nirmaan kiya he
 Sajid's brother and famous filmmaker Imtiaz Aliis is also presenting the film
 aaie jaanate hai aakhirkaar kisi bani he yah film
 The story of the film is of Kais Bhat (avinash Tiwari) and Laila (trupti Dimri), who live in Kashmir
 cas ke pita bahut bade bijnesaman hai or laila ke pita se unka chhattis kaa aankada he
 As the story progresses, cass-laila meets
 unke bich pyaar panpane lagata he
 Which does not justify according to family relationships
 laila-majanu kii kahani alag-alag mode leti hui antat usee andaaj main khatm hoti he jiskaa aap andaja laga sakate hai
 However, to know what happens in the end, you will have to watch the film
 View this post on instagramlaila Majnu another old famous Love Story based bollywood film is releasing today
 
 The film featuring Avinash Tiwary as Majnu and Tripti Dimri as Laila 
 Directed by Sajid Ali, written by Imtiaz Ali and produced by Ekta Kapoor, Shobha Kapoor and Preety Ali
 
 Ekta Kapoor bet in the Contemporary story is worthy or not, only the audience can decide this
 will post the review after watching it
 If you by watch it before us so please dont forget to share your honest opinion with us (@chatpatbollywood) onsep 6, 2018 at 11:53 am PDT Weak Link The weak link of the film is its bumpy story, which seems to be stuck in different kinds of twist
 laila or majanu naam jaise hi saamne aate hai aapako pyaar hi pyaar chaaron taraf dikhaai dene lagata he
 But while watching the film, this love may seem unrequited
 screenple ko durust kiya ja saktaa tha
 With this, the first part of the story is quite a bit shaky
 yah film nahin kisi dharawahik ke jaisaa tha, jise bahut saare episods main dekha ja saktaa he
 But it has not got the full flavor of the film
 iske gane bhi ausat se neeche hai
 Although the writing of Irshad Kamil is amazing
 jaaniye aakhir film ko kyon dekh sakate hankeshmir ek aisi jagah he jahaan par aap kahin bhi camera rakh dijie aapako ek acha prem dikhaai detaa he
 This is the reason why the location of the film is very good
 saath hi jis tarah se film kaa aagaaj or ise anjaam mila he vah bhi dilachasp he
 Avinash Tiwarika's work is very good
 majanu ke kirdaar ko nibhaane ke liye jo parishram kiya he vah parde par dikhaai detaa he
 Avinash will also get the benefit of this in upcoming films
 tripti dimrine sahaj abhinay kiya he
 The work of actor Mir Sarwar, who hails from Kashmir origin, is quite interesting
 lekin sumit kaul ne bahut hi jabardast abhinay kiya he
 The last 30 minutes of this film are awesome
 movie main imtiyaaj kaa flavor najar aata he
 In a way, you can say that the love of the 90s will be seen while watching the film

 Rahul Gandhi, who has spoken about giving a new brand to politics, is now not only trying to emerge with his sister Priyanka by becoming the language and brand of new politics but also putting lives in the Congress
 gat chunaavon main unhone ek baatcheet main muskaraate hue kaha tha, ''main desh kii raajnneeti main nayaa brands laaungaa
 Just wait
 '' kise maaloom tha ki ve or unki bahan priyanka wadra dhire-dhire khud raajnneeti ke nae brands banakar ubharenge
 Probably, for a month, everyone's eyes were on in Rae Bareli and Amethi in Uttar Pradesh as Priyanka kept seeking votes for single mother Sonia Gandhi and brother Rahul Gandhi in scorching sun, dust and heat
 na koi falsafa, na koi agenda or na hi koi baari-bharkam bhaashan
 Just an appeal, "just like you have come to see me today, in the same way, come in large numbers to vote for Rahul
" mujhe pataa he garmi bahut he or yah shaadiyon kaa sijan he, par aapako aana or vot daalana he
 "then in the midst of Jai Ho's slogan, she says," Don't think that a leader owes you something
 yah aapkaa adhikaar he
 "that's not enough to get into people's hearts
" yadi koi unhen phulon kii maala pahana detaa to ve use utaarti nahin balki daadi indira gandhi kii blue, hari yaa marun sari pahane thik usee tarah itaraati phiratin jaise bachche koi nayaa manapsand libaas pahanakar itaraate phirte hai
 If someone asked why she was campaigning only in amethi-rae Bareli, her direct answer would have been, "I have come here to campaign only for mother and brother
" main kahin or nahin gai kyonki main raajnneeti main nahin hum
 When i am not in politics, it would not be right for me to campaign elsewhere
 ''magar jab unhone sweekaar kiya ki unki shakl, khaas taur se unki naak, unki daadi kii naak se milti he to yah baat kam-se-kam bhaajapa ko acchhee nahin lagi
 BJP national spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad termed it as a 'gimmick' in public life and said that someone's nose in the family must have resembled that of another member
 ab yah rashtriya mudda ban rahaa he
 Prasad also defined the family and familism from the press in Lucknow
 daramil bhai-bahan ne is baar saare desh kii nigahen uttar pradesh kii ore mode deen or unke kaaran maano barason se haashiye par padi congress main jaan aa gai or party kii ummiden nai bulandi ko chune lageen
 When Priyanka and Rahul started emerging as a brand for the younger generation within the party and the opposition grew uneasily, Congress spokesperson Virender Madan said, "the nervousness of the opposition is the proof that Rahul ji and Priyanka ji are fast becoming the minds of the people But umbrellas are going on
 ve yuva shakti ke pratik hai or khud apni mehnat, nishtha or lagan se apni pahchaan bana rahe hai
 Rahul is doing his marketing and branding in his own way
 ek raat ve is baat par gaur kiye bina ki orissa main naksaliyon kaa khauf he, balangir shahar main tahaltey hue achaanak bas adde chale gaye or yatriyon ke saath baithkar chaay pi or gappe maarin
 Everyone was stunned
 daliton ke ghar jaakar unke saath ruknaa or bhojan lenaa puraani baat ho chuki he or inhen baton se mukhyamantri mayawati itani ghabraati hai ki apni sabhaaon main iskaa zikr kiye bina nahin rahati
 She now speaks of Congress rule for the plight of Uttar Pradesh and attacks Rahul, saying that going to a Dalit's house to eat something, stay or adopt a child soaked in mud will not uplift Dalits
 ye tamaasha he
 Rahul says in response, "nowadays it has become fashion
 jab bhi main kisi gaanv main jaataa hum to ve yah kahkar meraa uphaas udaate hai ki main gaanv main jaataa hum, unki tarah asi kamare main kyon nahin baithta
 But for me the real India is the village itself
 ''party ke logon kaa kahana he ab congress hi nahin, vipaksh bhi rahul or priyanka kii branding karne laga he
 What's wrong with this? On the other hand, when Mayawati started saying that the Center is not helping the development of Uttar Pradesh, Rahul said in a meeting in Barabanki, "the Center gets money for development but heard that such an elephant in Lucknow Is sitting who swallows everything
 '' log hanse bhi or soch main dub gaye ki aakhir centre se naregaa or dupahari bhojan sareekhee yojanaon ke tahat jo paisa aata he, uskaa hota kya he
 Although the Opposition sarcastically calls him Yuvraj and the party people themselves want to see Rahul as Prime Minister in a concise tone, but Rahul says that he is not ready yet
 darasal aaj ve khud apni branding kar rahe hai, jiske kaaran vipaksh unke prayaas kii aalochana kar unke brands ko jane-anjaane aage badha rahaa he or phir kuch dinon baad raajnneeti ke bazaar main ve jam jaaenge
 They already have the seal of the nehru-gandhi family
 bundelkhand main kam varsha ke kaaran sookhe ke halaat ban gaye hai, insaan ko dana or jaanavar ko chaare ke liye sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he
 People struggling with crisis are coming forward to help each other
 aisa hi najaara mahoba jile ke soopa gaanv main dekhne ko mila, jahaan ek pita makar sankranti ke uphaar ke taur par baiylgaadee main bhusa bharkar beti kii sasuraal pahunchaa
 Shagun, the daughter of Parikshit Prajapati of Silat village in Mahoba district, is married in Soupa village, Suman has three children
 parivaar kaa rojgaar kaa jariya kheti or pashupaalan he
 But this time the drought has turned the fields into deserted fields
 pani kii kami ke chalate beej ke bhi bekaar hone kii ashanka thi, isliye buvaai bhi nahin kii
 This has led to a straw crisis for animals
 shagun ke ghar main bhusa na hone kii khabar jab uske pita parakshit ko hui to ve silaat se baiylgaadee main bhusa bharkar beti kii ghar ja pahunche
 Parikshit said that although there has been a tradition of sending sweets and fruits on the occasion of Makar Sankranti, this time they have arrived with a straw keeping in mind the need of the daughter
 unke damaad or beti ko bhusa khareednaa aasaan nahin he, yahi kaaran he ki ve apane ghar se bhusa lekar yahaan aae hai
 Parikshit says that the elders of the family will somehow be fed, but the children need milk, if the animal does not have the straw, then how will the children get milk, keeping this in mind, they have reached the daughter-in-law's house 
 parakshit jaise hi bhusa se bhari baiylgaadee lekar pahunche to shagun or uske pati ramesh ke chehre khil uthe
 Together they emptied the bullock cart
 unhen pataa he ki yahi bhusa uske jaanavar ko bachaayegaa, uske paas keval ek bhens or uskaa baccha he
 When there will be no food to feed in the drought, then this will be the buffalo support of the farmer's family
 tippaniyan Ramesh said that he does not have fodder and straw for his cattle to eat
 yahi kaaran he ki uske sasur bhusa lekar aae hai
 This time he did not even sow in the field, which is why he had to choose another way of employment
 usne karj lekar auto kharida he, usee se parivaar kaa pet bhar rahaa he
 Bundelkhand is spread over 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
 is ilaake main beete chaar varshon se lagaataar sookhaa pad rahaa he
 On one side there is a crisis of grain and fodder, on the other side the water resources have dried up
 insaan se lekar jaanavar tak ko aasaani se pani naseeb nahin ho paa rahaa he
 This situation is pointing to a serious crisis to come
 mahoba jile ke silaat gaanv ke parakshit prajapati kii beti shagun kii shaadi soopa gaanv main hui he, suman ke teen bachche hai
 The family's source of employment is farming and animal husbandry
 magar is baar sookhe kii maar ne kheton ko viraan maidan main badal diya he
 Due to lack of water, the seeds were also feared to be useless, so did not even sow
 iske chalate jaanwaron ke liye bhuse kaa sankat khadaa ho gaya he
 When his father Parikshit came to know about the absence of straw in Shagun's house, he went to the daughter's house by filling the straw in the bullock cart from Silat
 parakshit ne kaha ki vaise to makar sankranti ke maukey par mithai or fal bhejne kii parampara rahi he, magar is baar ve beti kii jarurat ko dhyaan main rakhkar bhusa lekar pahunche hai
 His son-in-law and daughter are not easy to buy husk, which is why they have come here with straw from their home
 parakshit kaa kahana he ki parivaar ke bade sadasyon kaa to kisi tarah pet bhar jayega, magar bacchon ke liye to doodh chahie hi, agar jaanavar ko bhusa nahin hoga to bacchon ko doodh kaise milegaa, isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar ve beti kii sasuraal pahunche hai
 As soon as Parikshit arrived with a cart full of straw, Shagun and her husband Ramesh's face blossomed
 unhone aapas main miljulkar baiylgaadee ko khaali karaayaa
 They know that this straw will save his animal, he has only one buffalo and his child
 sookhe main jab pet bharne ke liye ann nahin hoga, tab kisaan ke parivaar kaa sahaara yahi bhens hegi
 The comments ramesh ne bataaya ki uske maweshiyon ke khaane ke liye chaara or bhusa nahin he
 This is why his father-in-law has brought straw
 is baar usne khet main bowni tak nahin kii, yahi kaaran he ki use rojgaar kaa doosraa rasta chunanaa padaa he
 He has bought an auto by taking a loan, feeding the family with it
 bundelkhand uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh ke 13 jilon main failaa hua he
 The area has been witnessing continuous drought for the last four years
 ek taraf dane or chaare kaa sankat he to duusari ore jalstrot suukh chale hai
 Water is not able to get easily from human to animal
 yah sthiti aane vaale gambhir sankat kii ore ishaara kar rahi he

 In rural India, the figure was 18 per cent in the last December of 2016, which increased to 20 in December 2017

 The total urban population of the country is less than the total rural population, it is clear that even today there is a large digital gap between urban and rural areas

 That is, in the price of up to 30 thousand rupees, the company has really given much better specifications
 phul rivyuu ke dauraan ham aapako bataaenge ki vaaki main is phone main paisa lagaana chahie yaa nahin
 This is the company's first premium phone and the company has put a lot of emphasis in it
 philhal pehali najar main is smartphone kii bild quality or luk ke bare main baat karen to iskaa overol body keval glass or metal kaa bana hua he
 Gorilla glass has been used in both the front and back here

 jald hi iskaa puraa rivyuu ham aapako bataaenge
 The Trump administration on Wednesday praised India for its important anti-terror measures and said that Pakistani terror groups are continuing their attacks in India
 america videsh vibhaag ne apni vaarshik report ‘country report on terarysm’ main kaha ki bhartiya netritv ne gharelu str par aatanki hamalon ko rokane or america tathaa samaan vichaardhaara vaale deshon ke saath milakar aatank ke shadyantrkariyon ko nyaay ke kathghare main laane kaa sankalp vyakt kiya he
 The comments report main kaha gaya, ‘‘bharat lagaataar hamale jhelta rahaa, pakistani aatanki sanghathanon kii ore se or adivasee tathaa maovadiyon kii taraf se bhi
 Indian officials blamed Pakistan for cross-border attacks in Jammu and Kashmir
 ’’ (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he

 ) The US State Department, in its annual report 'country Report on Terrorism', said that the Indian leadership has pledged to stop the domestic terror attacks and bring terror conspiracies to justice together with the US and like-minded countries
 
 tippaniyan "india has been continuously under attack, both from Pakistani terrorist organizations and also from tribal and Maoists," the report said
 bhartiya adhikariyon ne pakistan ko jammu-kashmir main seemaa paar se hone vaale hamalon kaa jimmedaar tehraaya

 ) There were hunger strikes
 kuch par logon kii najar gai or baaki par kisi ne khaas dhyaan nahin diya
 Even stalwarts like bjp's Advani and Jaitley could not advance the goodwill mission beyond Gujarat
 anshan bhaajapa or uske samarthakon tak hi simat kar rah gaya
 We may easily become owls, but still so intelligent that we can distinguish between a political fast and a three-day fast
 aksar mana jaataa he ki bhartiya anshan ko lekar bhavuk hote hai kyonki use vah dharm se jodate hai, mahatma gandhi ke saadhutv or sansaarik raajnneeti ne is manyata ko badhaayaa lekin aaj bhi anshan ko kaamyaab banane ke liye kuch sharton ko puraa karnaa jaruri he
 It is not enough that the fast is for some very big work
 agar yah anshan kuch hi logon tak simat kar rah jaae to iskaa koi auchity nahin he
 Political hunger is successful only when a large section of the society believes that their fundamental democratic rights are being disregarded openly
 janata ko saaf taur par yah baat samaj main aani chahie
 On the 66th day of a hunger strike in a prison in Northern Ireland when Bobby Sands died, a wave of outrage raged in the country as he was representing those who aspired to Irish nationalism
 sufraget, catherine frai ne pratishthit darja hasil kiya kyonki mahilaon ke liye samaan adhikaron kii maang main anshan karte hue unhone dam tod diya
 Similarly, Mahatma Gandhi succeeded because he fasted for freedom and the rights of citizens
 inhen vajahon se srilanka main 1987 main tilipan kii bhukh hadtaal ko vyapak samarthan mila
 Similarly, the sacrifices of Akbar Ganji in Iran and Pedro Louis Boytal in Cuba
 1952 main jab andhra pradesh ko sambhasheeya banane ke liye potti shriramlu kii anshan ke 82wein din maut hui, hyderabad se chennai tak janaakrosh dikhaai diya
 If these knights are remembered today, it is only because there was transparency in their movement
 chalbaaj sarkarein loktantric adhikaron kaa khullamakhulla hanan kar bhukh hadtaal karne waalon ko had darje tak vaidhata pradaan kar detii hai
 Hunger strikes often take the wrong form, due to the thinking that since it has a good purpose, it will definitely get public support
 swami nigamanand bina kisi prasiddhi ke chal based kyonki ganga kii safai kii unki khwaahish ko loktantric adhikaar ke rup main pesh nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Similarly, Darshan Singh Feruman lost his life in 1969 due to a 74-day fast
 unki maang thi ki chandigarh ko sirf punjab kii rajdhani banaaya jaae jise puraa nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Unfortunately, the movement of Feruman attracted few people, it could not be called a policy matter but of authority
 kisi bhi aise mudde par anshan naakaam hona tay he jo aspasht ho or jisaki vyakhya kai tarah se kii jaae
 If those who go on a hunger strike do not want their unnatural and lonely death, then they should keep this in mind
 fateh singh or tara singh kaa kya hashr hua
 His frequent fasts soon became a joke for the public
 aadhe-adhure man se hone vaali bhukh hadataalon se yah dharna paidaa hoti he ki bhartiya anashnon ke mugalate main aasaani se aa jate hai or chaalaak raajnneetik uskaa puraa phayda uthaate hai
 As we see, this is not entirely true
 agar ek taraf anna hajaare hai to duusari taraf kai farji gandhivadi hai
 Anna's fast was successful from the perspective that he showed that his fight was for the citizens of the country
 bharat ke harek kone main bhrashtachar he, yahaan tak ki shuturamurgon se bhari cabinet bhi ise khatm nahin kar sakati
 If Anna Hazare would have wandered from here to there on the most important issue and got entangled in policies, he would have been chanting garlands in his Ralegan siddhi
 agar ve apni pehle kii sthiti ''meraa vidheyak yaa kuch bhi nahin'' par ade rahete to bhi unki lokapriyata dhire-dhire kam hi hoti
 The actual nature of anti-corruption law is a policy matter and there is scope for debate on it
 lekin jarurat is baat kii he ki ek majboot kanoon ho jise janata apana kanoon kah sake
 Narendra Modi did not have any of these things for a successful fast
 shuru se aakhir tak unka anshan nirdeshit or air condishand maamla tha
 Most importantly, what were the violated democratic rights they were trying to restore
 anshan kaa dhindhora peetna, lekin uske mudde ko nazarandaaj karnaa aisa hi he jaisaa ki sarkas khatm hone ke baad joker kaa khel
 Modi may have felt the same after the Sadbhavana show ended
 deepankar gupta rajnatik tikaakar or samajashastri hai

 ) After getting orders from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Trivendra Singh Rawat government of Uttarakhand has come into action regarding the development work of Kedarnath region
 piem modi kaa devbhumi uttarakhand ke prati prem or samarpan jagajaahir he
 This is the reason why he visited Uttarakhand thrice in the last six months
 khaskar unki baba kedaar ke prati kaaphi aasthaa he
 Now the development of Kedarnath region has become a center of faith for him

 rishton ko todane jitna aasaan kaam koi nahin hota or iske baad hone vaala dil kaa dard bhi koi nahin samaj saktaa
 Often, when a relationship breaks up, there is a solid reason behind it
 lekin kai baar rishta kyon tutaa iskaa pataa hi nahin chal paata
 Are you also engaged in breaking your relationship without any reason? agar aapke dimag main bhi aisa hi kuch chal rahaa he to brallep karne se pehle ek baar apane rishte ko ek mauka jarur den
 Let go of the turmoil going on in your mind and mind and calm down and think if you really want to breakup? Whether or not there is a solid reason for breaking up
 
 
 aapke man kii uljhan ko sulajhane main madad karenge kuch suzav
 Learn these 5 things before breaking up
 
 
 1
 Doesn't he give you time? The only way to keep fresh in any relationship is to give each other plenty of time
 aapkaa samay ek aapke partner ke liye kisi keemtee tohfe se bhi zyada hota he jo unhen saare jahaan kii khushiyaan de saktaa he 
 If your partner is desperate to spend time with you then you are lucky because there is nothing precious from time
 itane pyaare saathi ko bhul se bhi na jaane den
 2
 kya vah aapkaa sammaan nahin karte?brallep karne kii ek or mahatvapurn vajah hoti he aapas main ek duusare kaa sammaan na hona
 But if your partner respects you, your work and every person connected with you, then you should think once before ending such relationship
 3
 Is he cheating on you? It is also important to have love, respect and trust in any relationship
 agar aapkaa partner aapako apane har sach or jhutheke bare main bataata he
 They have not kept you in any kind of deception yet, then you should find some other solid reason before the breakup
 4
 Is your mental stress not going to be the reason? Sometimes we do not understand that our mental stress becomes the reason for ending our good relationship
 agar aapako apane partner par bevajaah gussa aata he
 When you talk to them, you get rained on and they love and listen to you, then this relationship is the best gift of your life, do not break it, but save it
 5
 Are you not looking for an option? Human nature is very bad
 jindagi main sab achchhachal rahaa ho to bhi hamen kuch khaali sa lagata hi rahata he
 Many times there is no tuning match with the partner or your habits are different, the choice is not the same but it does not mean that you start exploring the options
 do alag swabhaav ke log aksar best kapal banate hai 
 Keep a relationship with your beloved
 bevajaah ke tanaav yaa baton main aakar apni jindagi ke haseen palon ko khud se hi kharaab karne se bachein

 For the past several years, the biopic of the box office has been waving films

 haalanki kamai ke maamle main suurama ranbir starer sanju ke saamne khadi nahin hoti
 But without any major starcast, aggressive promotion, Surma has done well

 While Sanju and other big biopic films have got around 1500-4000 screens
 suurama kaa bajet lagbhag 32 karod rupye bataaya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, it can be said that the film will take out its budget on the basis of positive review

 (from input language) (input bhashaa se) Ben Stokes played a key role in the outcome of the final of the ICC World Cup
 28 saal ke is dhurandhar olerounder ne apane balle ke dam par england ko aisi sanjivani di ki english team ne pehali baar world cap jitkar itihaas rach diya
 Ben Stokes' unbeaten 84 off 98 balls proves him the match winner at the historic Lord's on Sunday
 lekin aakhri over kii chauthi gend par aisi 'ghatni' ghati, jisase match kii tasviir badal sakati thi
 When England needed 9 runs off 3 balls to win, Stokes would have been out on the fourth ball of the last over
 to final kii kahani kuch or hoti
 Click here to see Ben Stokes' VIDEO
 Actually, Stokes fired a strong shot towards midwicket on the fourth ball of Trent Boult, who was throwing his last over of the match
 is dauraan doosraa ran lete vakt martin gaptil kaa diarect thro wicket par lag saktaa tha- agar stokes ne dive lagaate vakt apane balle se us thro ko na roka hota, jo baad main unke haath par lagakar boundry ke paar chali gai or is gend par kul 6 (2+4) ran mil gaye
 After this run, the England team was able to bring itself to the position of super over
 baad main super over taai hua or boundry ke aadhaar par england world champion ban gai
 The question now arises whether Stokes did this to avoid a run out
 
 The Why was he not dismissed by umpire Kumar Dharmasena under Obstructing the field? 
 The But instead of giving out Stokes, Dharmasena counted his fingers for 6 runs
 kya kahata he Obstructing the field kaa niyam ?zyaadaatar maamalon main yah baadha (obstruction) tab maani jaati he, jab ballebaaj sochataa he ki vah ran out hone vaala he or vah gend ko apane balle se roktaa he yaa gend ko block karne ke liye viketon ke bich daudte hue apana rasta badalata he
 If this obstruction is done intentionally, the batsman will surely be given out
 agar ballebaaj kaa gend se sampark anjaane main hua ho, to vah out nahin hoga
 Looking at Stokes' case, it is revealed that he did not deliberately stop the throw with his bat to avoid a run out
 iske baad stokes ne apane donon haath upar kar jataana chaha- 'maine jaanboojhkar kuch nahin kiya
 'there was also no appeal from New Zealand

 aakhir 9 maheene pehle hi congress se bijepi main shaamil hue arvinder singh lavali kaa bijepi se itani jaldi mohabhang kyon ho gaya? ye wo sawaal he jise har koi jaananaa chahta he
 This veteran leader of East Delhi was very important for BJP, who has been looking for Sikh face for a long time
 isse pehle bijepi ke liye dilli main sikh chehre ke rup main arapy singh maujuud hai
 But he is also not such a big name and has also lost the election
 vahiin, arvinder singh gandhinagar seat se kabhi nahin haare, lekin bijepi main 'sanghathan' ko dekh rahe log lavali ko sambhaal nahin paae
 Lovely's close friends say that this was a major reason behind his return to Congress
 sutron ke mutabik, bijepi ke kuch netaa arvinder singh lavali ko ye jataane main peeche nahin rahe ki wo bahari hai
 At the same time, this tall leader of Congress was not given any major work in BJP
 ye jarur he ki unhen party kii ahm baithkon main bulaayaa jaataa tha, lekin kabhi bhi vahaan unki baat ko tarjeeh nahin mili
 In the BJP, he did not even see a clear picture of his political future
 arvinder singh lavali bijepi ke andar apni ansuni se pehle se hi sakate main the
 Meanwhile, there was an incident in the BJP that shook Lovely inside
 jisane unhen ye sochane ko majaboor kar diya ki bijepi main unki koi ginati hi nahin he
 At the same time, his 'homecoming' initiative was taken on a large scale by the Congress leadership, then he too did not delay in grabbing the 'hand'
 darasal, kejariwal sarkaar ke teen saal puure hone par arvind kejariwal sarkaar kii naakaamiyon or ranneeti ko lekar bijepi ne baithak bulaai
 Apart from Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari, the Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, Vijender Gupta, a former state president of the party, the three General Ministers and the Organization Minister were also to be present
 lekin jab wo meeting main shaamil hone ke liye dilli bijepi offis pahunche to vahaan sirf do mahaamantri or sanghathan mantri ke alaava koi nahin tha
 Arvinder Singh later came to know that the state president was not even aware of this important meeting
 vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta bhi der se aae
 The organization made a move to Minister Lovely, saying that he should prepare a draft of the 'white paper' after discussing with the two ministers, later other senior leaders will also be consulted on it
 lavali ko jin do mahaamantriyon ke saath meeting ke liye choda gaya tha, raajnneetik kad or anubhav ke maamle main ve donon lavali ke saamne kahin nahin thaharte hai
 Due to this, Lovely was very hurt and somehow they settled the meeting and left
 yahi wo vaakya tha jisase wo aahat hue
 Arvinder Singh Lovely, who joined BJP after getting angry with Ajay Maken, was also very hurt that he had to struggle a lot to talk to the BJP president
 jab lavali ko party adhyaksh se baat karnaa hota tha to unke pie ko phone karnaa padataa tha
 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari did not pick up the phone on most occasions
 lekin jaise hi congress main unako lekar thodi sugabugahat shuru hui unhone bijepi se alag congress main janaa behatar samajha
 On Monday, in the Amla police station area of bareilly district in Uttar Pradesh, a former village headman tied two men in a tree with whips on the charge of alleged involvement in exterminating the girl, which killed one youth and the other is hospitalized by being half-dead

 But before this dispute, let us consider that aspect of how the country is formed, because after independence no Nizam or any princely state was willing to come under the Government of India
 sab kii bhaavana khud ko swatantra rakhane kii thi
 But Sardar Patel only understood the spirit of the country and when the princely state of Junagadh openly protested, Sardar Patel sieged Junagadh with the army
 junagarh ko tel-koyale kii supplai, hawaii-dak sampark roak kar aarthik gheraabandi kar di

 kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ke us bayaan par ki maovadiyon ke saath koi baatcheet nahin hogi or hamalaa hone par uchit jawaab diya jayega, se bihar ke mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ke vaicharik rup se asahmati jataae jane par bhaajapa ke varisht netaa or purv upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne aarope lagaaya ki naksalwad ko lekar maanjhi kaa bayaan suraksha balon kaa manobal giranevaala he
 Sushil Modi issued a press release saying that the Bihar government should tell who prevented him from talking to the Naxalites
 purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar 9 varshon tak pradesh ke grahamantri bhi rahe
 It was only in 2009 that the then Union Home Minister p Chidambaram offered talks to the Naxalites
 in paanch saalon main naksali kabhi baatcheet ke liye aage nahin aaye
 The Naxalites believe in armed revolution and through that they want to overturn governments
 unhone kaha ki kendriya grahamantri ne naksal samasya se nipatane ke liye santulit rukh akhriyaar karne kii baat kahi he jisamen suraksha, vikaas, samaaj kalyaan evam sarkari yojanaon kii naksal kshetron main pahunch ko praathamikta di gayi he
 But the Naxalites do not believe in development work
 unhone kaha ki pichley teen varshon main bihar main 163 skool bhawanon ko dhwast karne ke saath hi sadak nirmaan kaary main lagi saikadon jesibi mashiinon ko phoonk diya or nirmaan agenciyon se rangadari vasuul kar naksaliyon ne vikaas kaaryon ko khaarij kiya he phir aise main rajya sarkaar vikaas kaary ko gati kaise degi
 Sushil said that the state government should also tell how many Naxalites surrendered under the surrender and rehabilitation package they had made for the Naxalites and why the government's plan failed
 susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki bihar sarkaar ko bataanaa chaiye ki kya andhra pradesh kii grey hound kii tarj par vishesh police bal ke gathan ke suzav ko darkinar kar vah naksal kshetron se naksal virdohi vishesh daste or ardhsainik balon ko waapas kar legi
 Will the government remain mute spectator even on the killing of innocents
 unhone kaha ki naksaliyon ke prati narmi or prabhavi karrwai nahin kiye jane par kendra sarkaar se fatkaar khaane ke baad kya bihar sarkaar agali baar bulaai gai is tarah kii kisi baithak kaa bahishkaar karegi
 Sushil alleged that due to the softness of the Bihar government and glorifying the Naxalites to help in vote bank and elections, it has helped the Naxalites to reach out in 33 of the 38 districts of the state
 unhone daawa kiya ki naksaliyon kii vajah se hi bihar vidhansabha ke adhyaksh ko apni jaan par khatra he or yah apane kshetra tak main jane kii himmat nahin juta paa rahe hai
 Sushil said that along with blasting the goods train near Mehsi in East Champaran recently, the Naxalites are also succeeding in carrying out violent incidents
 unhone kaha ki varsh 2013 main jahaan puure desh main naksali hinsaatmak ghatnaon main kami aayi thi, vahiin bihar main 41 pratishat kaa ijapha hua tha
 Of the weapons that Naxalites have looted from the police all over the country, 62 percent of the weapons have been looted by the Bihar government
 aise main sarkaar kaa bayaan naksal kshetron main tainaat suraksha balon kaa manobal giranevaala he
 Bihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi, while expressing ideological disagreement, said that with the help of guns, Naxalism cannot be solved but we have to find out the reasons behind it and the only solution lies in the all-round development of the society
 unhone kaha tha ki rojgaar or saamaajik-aarthik-shaikshanik vikaas main kami ko lekar niraashaa ke saath saath kamjor tabakon ke bich nyaay kii anuplabdhta ke kaaran naksalwad saamne aayaa he
 The only solution lies in development
 maanjhi ne kaha tha ki purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne rajya main maowad mudde ke hal kaa prayaas kiya or isse nipatane kii khatir vanchit logon ke liye vikaas kaary shuru kiya
 He said that this policy really helped and the situation in the state has changed so much that our Maoist brothers are having difficulty in searching for new people
 yuva unase nahin judana chaahate
 Development makes people away from Naxalism
 maanjhi ne kaha tha ki hamaara iraadaa bihar main itnaa vikaas karne kaa he ki naksalwad jaisi samasya kaa swat: samaadhaan ho jaae
 If we bring development to the slums of the poor, then Naxalism will definitely end

 On the way Khurshid's supporters showed black flags, Kejriwal said that they were few people
 yahi nahin kejariwal ne unhen stage par aane ke liye aamantrit bhi kiya
 He told those who showed black flags that stealing the money of the disabled is the most disgusting corruption
 yahaan tak ki upi sarkaar kii jaanch main bhi yah ghapala saamne aayaa tha
 Kejriwal accused Salman Khurshid and his wife Louise Khurshid that they ate the money of the handicapped by fake signatures of officers
 14 main se 11 jilon main viklangon ke naam par ghapala kiya gaya
 Kejriwal accused Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that he did not give time to meet the disabled, he wanted to meet them and put their problems in front of them
 arvind ne saath main yah bhi kaha ki khurshid ne ek baar bolaa tha ki main sonia gandhi ke liye jaan de duungaa, lekin hamen to laga tha ki vah janata ke sevak hai, unke liye jaan denge
 In the end he questioned the public whether he would like to choose Khurshid again? udhar, kejariwal jab farrukhabad main raily karne ja rahe the, to gantavy sthal se 30 kilometre dur malikpur main khurshid ke samarthakon ne unke kafile ko roak liya, jisase prastaavit raily ek ghante kii deree se shuru hui

 In this, Laxman Singh is reportedly saying that if Punni Shukla is removed from the post of Municipal Congress President, the rally can be canceled
 vahiin india anguest karpshan kaa kahana he ki yah sidi farji he or ise chhedchhad karke taiyaar kii gai he
 Amid threats from the opposition, the government had banned the use of sticks and weapons in this rally
 kejariwal ko 11 sharton ke saath raily kii ijaajat di gai thi or yahaan suraksha ke jabardast intjaam kiye gaye the
 He said that we roam with our lives on our palm

 Not only this, Kejriwal also invited him to come on stage

 Even in the investigation of UP government, this scandal came to light
 kejariwal ne salmaan khurshid or unki patni louis khurshid par aarope lagaaya ki unhone afasaron ke farji hastakshar karke viklangon kaa paisa khaaya

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh par kejariwal ne aarope lagaaya ki unhone viklangon ko milane kaa samay nahin diya, ve unase milakar apni samasyaayein unke saamne rakhana chaahate the
 Arvind also said that Khurshid once said that i will die for Sonia Gandhi, but we thought that he is a public servant, will die for him
 ant main unhone janata se sawaal kiya ki kya vah dobaaraa khurshid ko chunanaa chahenge? On the other hand, when Kejriwal was going to rally in Farrukhabad, Khurshid's supporters stopped his convoy in Malikpur, 30 km from the destination, which started the proposed rally by an hour
 raily main shaamil hone ja rahe bhartiya kisaan union ke kaaryakarta kii car ke shishe bhi tod die gaye

 surveen chawla kii film het story-2 ne pehle din box offis par 5

 Despite not being a big starcast and a touch of boldness, the film's opening can thus be considered as the best
 film ke relies hone se pehle isaki jamkar charchaa kii vajah se hi distributors ne screens kii sankhya 600 se badhaakar 1,200 karne ke liye kaha tha
 This opening is bigger than the opening of many big stars like Madhuri Dixit (dedh Ishqiya) and Amitabh Bachchan (bhootnath Returns) released this year
 yani film kaa bold factor kaam kar gaya he
 Anyway, this year Sunny Leone's Ragini MMS-2 was also in the headlines due to its boldness
 rajya sabha main devendra goud ke puche sawaal par grih mantralay ne apane likhit jawaab main kaha ki i vija kii suvidha 161 deshon ke liye ab tak badhaai ja chuki hai
 At the same time, the process of involving more countries is going on
 grih mantralay ne rajya sabha ko bataaya ki navambar 2014 se 2016 ke ant tak 15 lakh ricard i vija jari kiye gaye
 Not only this, the Ministry of Tourism had also promised to provide a welcome kit on behalf of the government a few days before coming to India through e-visa
 is kit main tamaam jaankariyon ke saath-saath ekapri-actevated simcard hoga
 In this sim, where talk time of 50 rupees is given free, on the other hand, 50 MB data has also been talked about
 is sim ke jariye bharat aane vaala videshi paryatak yahaan aakar apane parivarajanon, apane logon ko apni khayr-khabar dene ke saath-saath yahaan apane tour and travel oparator se lekar taxi, hotel waalon se sampark karne main aasaani hogi
 You will be able to save 2-3 hours in taking SIM
 itnaa hi nahin, vah kuch samay pehle videshi paryatakon ke liye shuru kii gai tourist helpline seva kaa phayda bhi le sakenge
 You will be surprised to know that a large proportion of foreign tourists visiting the country are coming to India through e-visa
 isamen lagaataar badhottaree ho rahi he
 According to sources, over 1 million foreign tourists visited India through e-visas last year
 sirf i-vija waalon ko hi pre-actevated sim dene kii baat kahi gai he
 All information about them is available online
 jiske aadhaar par vairiffication ke turant baad unhen sim diya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, there is no possibility of any disturbance in terms of security

 This plan of Rs 999 is for both 2G and 3G customers
 airsel ne abhi tak bharat main 4G sevaaon kii shuruyaat nahin kii he
 But a legitimate question is whether a 2G subscriber can use 30GB of data a day? 999 rupee vaale plan ke saath hi airsel ke paas 249 or 397 rupee kaa combo tarriff plan bhi he
 In the Rs 249 plan, customers can make unlimited calls in any network

 On the plan of Rs 397, customers will be given 2GB per day for 56 days with unlimited voice calls and unlimited SMS

 in donon ne ab tak dakshin africa ke khilaaf chaar test maichon kii shrinkhalaa main 12-12 wicket liye hai
 Jadeja our 'banker' bowler Arun said after the rain fell on the second day's game, "I believe he got time to know which departments he has to improve
 ranjai trophy main uske pradarshan (saurashtra kii taraf se 30 se adhik wicket) se bhiuskaa kaaphi aatmavishvaas badha
 'he said,' With this, Jadeja is our 'banker' bowler

 He knows to use his strong sides for his own benefit
 ’ jadeja ne jahaan apane khel kaa akalan kiya vahiin coach ne kaha ki bhubaneshwar kumaar ko ‘gend adhik swing karaane kii jarurat’ he haalanki unhen khushi he ki vah pehle kii tulana main adhik teji se gend kar rahe hai
 Arun said about the Uttar Pradesh fast bowler sent to play Ranji Trophy, 'talking of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, he can bowl at a speed of more than 140 km and can also swing it
 bhuvi kaa majboot paksh uski swing he
 He has increased his speed a bit but he needs to swing more continuously and by working continuously he will also be successful in it
 ’ kai varshon tak rashtriya cricket academy se jude rahe arun kaa maananaa he ki desh main tej gendbaajon kaa acha rigerv pool he lekin unhen sahi maargdarshan kii jarurat he
 We have a good pool of bowlers, he said, 'it would be unfair to mention anyone's name right now but we have a good pool of bowlers
 hamen unki kshamta ke anusaar unhen guide karne kii jarurat he
 Regarding the improvement after Ishant's change in action, Arun said that in reality this Delhi fast bowler is now bowling from right angles which is giving him success
 unhone kaha, ‘eemaandaaree se kahuun tounake ection main bahut khaas badlaav nahin kiya gaya
 We made them aware of their bowling angle and told them from which angle they can get success
 ek baar yah jaanane ke baad ve apane kaushal kaa behatar istemaal kar sakate hai
 "this former Indian medium pace bowler was asked whether preparing a turning wicket would hamper the development of fast bowlers in India," he said, "I don't agree with that
" hamaare paas bharat main achche tej gendbaaj hai
 We have four such bowlers who can bowl at a speed of more than 140 km in a row
 ham aise viketon par khelnaa pasand karte hai jo hamaari team kii ranneetiyon ke anukool hon
 This (chinnaswamy) is not a helpful wicket for the spinners but it is a good wicket
 ’ match main ek din kaa khel barish kii bhent chadh jane ke bare main arun ne kaha, ‘abhi is test match main kaaphi samay bachaa he

 In the last several years, there is a discussion about Rohit Sharma that he is being given more opportunities
 unhen har koi aisa tallent maanata rahaa he, jo maukon ko barbaad karata rahaa he
 The slogan of the talented batsman was so sticky that even Rohit Sharma himself said that he has suffered more due to being talented, while he has become a batsman by his hard work and has moved from number eight batsman to number one
 haalanki in charchaaon kii sabase badi vajah yahi he ki rohit sharma ahm maukon par chookte rahe
 After being set, they do not show the will to not convert their innings into big innings and then batting well and losing wickets by playing bad shots
 in sabake baavjood rohit sharma khaas kyon hai, ye unhone kanpur ke green park stadium main ek baar phir dikhaa diya
 Rohit Sharma started the innings in the best style in front of South Africa's target of 304 runs and after that he scored runs in his style
 dekhte-dekhte unhone apane vanade kariyar kaa aathvaan shatak bana diya
 However, he has played 139 odis for this
 ab jaraa isaki tulana hashim amala se bhi kar lijie, jinhone 121 vanade maichon main 21 shatak thoke hai
 In this sense, the graph of Rohit Sharma's centuries should be much better, but the most important thing about his batting is that when he is batting, any bowling attack makes an average
 haalanki videshi pichon par unhen apni kaabiliyat sabit kerani he
 Despite this, when they are in rhythm, they are seen scoring runs like a funk
 tippaniyan Seeing them play stormy shots effortlessly, it seems that this batsman will not be out
 agar apni mehnat, practice or patibaddhta main rohit apana shat pratishat dene lage to ye sambhav bhi he
 This is the aspect due to which Rohit Sharma has not been able to consolidate his place in the star batsmen even after two double centuries in ODI cricket
 haalanki vah unase bahut dur bhi nahin dikhataa or unke paas samay bhi maujuud he
 However, the biggest reason for these discussions is that Rohit Sharma missed on important occasions
 set hone ke baad apni pari ko badi pari main tabdeel nahin karne kii ichhashakti nahin dikhaate or to or acha bhala ballebaaji karte hue kharaab shats khel kar wicket ganvaa dete hai
 Despite all this, why Rohit Sharma is special, he once again showed it at the Green Park Stadium in Kanpur
 dakshin africa ke 304 ranon ke lakshya ke saamne rohit sharma ne behtareen andaaj main pari kii shuruyaat kii or uske baad unhone apane andaaj main ran batore
 He scored an eighth century in his ODI career
 haalanki iske liye unhone 139 vanade khele hai
 Now compare it with Hashim Amla, who has scored 21 centuries in 121 odis
 is lihaaj se dekhen to rohit sharma ke shatakon kaa graph kahin behatar hona chahie, lekin unki ballebaazi kii sabase khaas baat ye he ki jab ve ballebaazi kar rahe hote hai, to kisi bhi gendbaazi akraman ko ausat bana dete hai
 However, he has to prove his ability on foreign pitches
 baavjood iske jab ve lay main hote hai, to kisi fankaar kii bhaanti ran batorte najar aate hai
 The comments unhen sahajata se tufaani shats khelte hue dekhne se lagata he ki ye ballebaaj to out hi nahin hoga
 If Rohit starts giving his 100 percent in his hard work, practice and commitment, then it is also possible
 yahi wo pahalu hai, jiske chalate rohit sharma vanade cricket main do dohare shatak ke baad bhi star ballebaazon main apni jagah majbooti se jamaa nahin paae hai

 However, he has played 139 odis for this
 ab jaraa isaki tulana hashim amala se bhi kar lijie, jinhone 121 vanade maichon main 21 shatak thoke hai
 In this sense, the graph of Rohit Sharma's centuries should be much better, but the most important thing about his batting is that when he is batting, any bowling attack makes an average
 haalanki videshi pichon par unhen apni kaabiliyat sabit kerani he
 Despite this, when they are in rhythm, they are seen scoring runs like a funk
 tippaniyan Seeing them play stormy shots effortlessly, it seems that this batsman will not be out
 agar apni mehnat, practice or patibaddhta main rohit apana shat pratishat dene lage to ye sambhav bhi he
 This is the aspect due to which Rohit Sharma has not been able to consolidate his place in the star batsmen even after two double centuries in ODI cricket
 haalanki vah unase bahut dur bhi nahin dikhataa or unke paas samay bhi maujuud he

 aise netaaon main ek hai ajit singh jo apane pita choudhary charan singh kii viraasat or apni jati ke aadhaar par maje se satta kaa anand lete rahe
 Regardless of which party is in power at the center, Ajit Singh continues to be a minister on the strength of a handful of mps from his party
 pashchimi uttar pradesh ke jat bahul ilaakon main ve apni jati ke sheersh netaa maane jate the

 Despite the rural environment, he sent his son Ajit Singh abroad to get higher education
 ajit singh ne ejineering kii ucch shiksha grahan kii or laga ki ve apane pita kii ichha ke mutabik is field main kuch kar dikhaaenge

 He became an MP, became a minister and won elections several times
 unke liye chunaav ladanaa behad aasaan tha kyonki apni jati ke logon par unka varchasv tha

 He was not willing to vacate the magnificent bungalow in which he had lived for 30 years, after the defeat
 unhen laga ki ise khaali karne se unki pratishtha par aanch aegi
 So he started a movement in western Uttar Pradesh, demanding that the bungalow be a memorial to Charan Singh
 vah ek tir se do shikaar karnaa chaahate hai
 On the one hand, occupy that magnificent bungalow and on the other hand to cast the votes of the Jats
 wo jat jo unase dur ja chuke the, ve lautakar unke kheme main aa jaaen iske liye unhen baithe-bithaae mudda mil gaya
 They have started airing this issue
 dilli chalo se lekar dilli ko pani na dene kii dhamkee dene jaisi chaalon par ve kaam kar rahe hai
 This is an excellent example of mild politics
 hairaani to is baat kii he ki charan singh ko gujarey hue aaj lagbhag 29 saal hone ja rahe hai lekin ajit singh ko kabhi yah nahin laga ki unki yaad main ek bada smarak banaaya jaae
 Due to his fame and his actions, he reached here today but he did not do anything in memory of his father
 jaahir he usamen unke apane paise kharch hote
 In such a situation, he has no hesitation in getting the memorial erected by the government

 ji haa, britain main kuch aise hi udhaaharan saamne aae hai, jinamein sabase taaja maamla ek rugby khilaadi joshua maric kaa he
 Marik, 19, died in January last year
 tab uske pita ne kaha tha ki aam dinon kii hi tarah maric us raat bhi apane kamare main sone ke liye gaya, lekin agle subah vah nahin jagaa
 The team investigating the death of Maric recently told that Maric was in a high caffeine energy drink and he may have died due to the same effect
 maric ke sharir kii toxicology jaanch karne vaale doctor ne bhi is baat kii pushti kii he uski maut ke peeche energy drink ek kaaran ho sakate hai
 This is just one example
 britain main aae din doctoron ke paas aise kai cese aa rahe hai, jinamein yuva sirdard, pet dard, neend naa aana, baicheni or kai baar gambhir pareshaaniyon ke saath aa rahe hai
 According to doctors, such young people mostly have high caffeine energy drink etc
 kya kehete hai visheshgauvisheshgyon ke anusaar, hai energy drink ke ek can main amuman 13 chammach chini or isi ke baraabar caffeine kii maatra do cap coffee ke anupaat main hoti he
 This quantity can be a threat to any young body and mind
 aam taur par yuva ek din main 3-4 can energy drink pi lete hai
 It contains approximately 640 mg of caffeine, while an adult is also instructed to take only 400 mg of caffeine in a day
 drink main caffeine kii maatra ko lekar ho niyamjarnal of caffeine research ke editor dow
 "the amount of caffeine should also be banned like cigarettes and alcohol," says Jack James
 haalanki caffeine drink ko hamaare samaaj main saadhaaran drink kii tarah liya jaataa he, lekin isaki maatra ko lekar sajag rahanaa chahie
 Otherwise it can have fatal consequences
 'energy drink ko lekar campagne chalaa rahe kaaryakartaaon ke anusaar prashasan ko aise energy drink par umr seemaa tay kar deni chahie
 Increasing irritability among children, says Brian, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders in England, "there are many children in the school who start the day with an energy drink rather than having breakfast
" aise bacchon ke vyavhaar main chidchidapan saaf taur par dikhaai detaa he
 Not only this, such children generally do not like to sit quietly in one place and are not able to concentrate in any work
 'america main 2011 main energy drink se sambandhit ek aise hi surveykshan ke anusaar, atyadhik maatra main caffeine lene se daura padane or sanak kii samasya ke saath hi maut bhi ho jaati he
 According to experts, people generally consider it as a soft drink, whereas it is not
 energy drink main caffeine kii maatra sidhe dimag par asar karti he, aise main kam umr main iske seven par sakht pabandi honi chahie
 a poem that agitates the mind and echoes for years
 aisa bahut hi kam hindi kavitaaon main dekhne ko miltaa he
 Some poets are Janakavi, some get the status of a national poet, but a poet is also a national poet, and very few poets get this honor
 ramdhaari singh dinkaraise hi kaviyon main se ek hai jinaki kavitaayen kisi anpadh kisaan ko bhi utani hi pasand he jitani ki un par research karne vaale scollar ko
 Dinkar's poem seems as relevant at this time as it was when it was written
 samay bhale hi badal gaya ho lekin paristhitiyaan abhi bhi waisi hi hai
 Dinkar was born on 23 September 1908 in Simaria village of Begusarai district, in today's Bihar state
 unki prasiddh rachanaaen urvashi, rashmirathi, renuka, samskruti ke chaar adhyay, hunkaar, samadheni, neem ke pattey hai
 He died on 24 April 1974
 pesh hai unki 5 kavitaayen

 kalam, aaj unki jai boljala asthiyaan baari-barichitakai jinamein chingaari,jo chadh gayi punyavedi paraliye bina gardan kaa molkalam, aaj unki jai bol
 The small lamp which has been extinguished on one side in our storms, will not be extinguished any day by burning water and affection
 pikar jinaki laal shikhaenugal rahi sau lapat dishaaen,jinke singhnaad se sahamidharti rahi abhi tak dolkalam, aaj unki jai bol
 Poor history of Marakya blind blind, Poor friend is his glory Chandra Geography Astronomy, today his glory

 May our farmers be the poets, our farmers do not have any rest, there is no such yam of oxen with me
 There is no name of happiness in life in tongue power arm in the mouth
 Dry bread is not available both evenings
 How do these brothers of the bails live all the year? How can the tongue, the eyes eat asymmetrical gum, perhaps drink the tears, but what the child has not learned, just the tears that have been drunk The mother would have been looking at the villain uncontrollably, she would have been flying with small pains from the fire, and would have given her blood to drink if today the thunderbolt of the thunderbolt weeps in the grave; The deaf milk is here in the milk-milk and vats temples
 Tell the milk-milk stars where are the Gods of these children, where is the milk-milk Ganga, you make your water milk; Where should i bring milk, from which house is milk-milk, a few drops of God Gagan dripping amber from Sehatom Vyom, We come to rob heaven from the cloud cult, milk and milk! We go to find your milk

 This silky city of India is full of dust, wet with tears, India still in the grip of distress
 dilli main to he khub jyoti kii chahal-pahal, par, bhatak rahaa he sara desh andhere main
 Those who write fortune-sheets with silky pens, have you ever wept with lack? Have you slept all over your house in gathering medicines for a sick child? Have you seen the fate of helpless farmers in the fields, flowing in the water? What? Will you eat? Have you seen this thinking, mad with despair, the ill-fated people remain silent? Have you seen many poles of the villages, whose dust has still fallen on the aura? The sari has not climbed correctly
 par tum nagaron ke laal, amiron ke putale, kyon vyathaa bhagyaheenon kii man main laaoge?jalataa ho sara desh, kintu, hokar adheer tum daud-daudkar kyon yah aag bujhaaoge?chintaa ho bhi kyon tumhen, gaanv ke jalane se, dilli main to rotiyaan nahin kam hoti handhulata na ashru-bundon se ankhon se kaajal, gaalon par kii dhuliyaan nahin nam hoti hai
 If they burn, then these villages should burn the country, when will the rest of New Delhi leave it? Or will it leave the silk palace in the Rakhegi Marg, or the grip of the storm

 Parshuram's waiting heroic brother! Who is responsible for the calamity? Who shall we blame for your slaughter? This deep question; How to explain the secret? If we have ten or twenty more, then we should count the names
 par, kadam-kadam par yahan khadaa patak he,har taraf lagaaye ghaat khadaa ghaatak he
 Deadly, who looks god-like, but, writes a wrong order in the room, the sinner who does not have the virtue; Gotra is cute, understand, he is the one who killed us here
 jo satya jaan kar bhi na satya kahata he,yaa kisi lobh ke vivash mook rahata he,us kutil rajtantri kadarya ko dhik he,yah mook satyahanta kam nahin vadhik he
 The thieves are those who are the forces of the thugs, thugs, whose sins sprout from the majesty, who cheat the deceitful people, or serve the peon; this sin has killed them only, India has gone home i have lost
 he koun yahan, kaaran jo nahin vipad kaa ?kis par jimmaa he nahin hamaare vadh kaa ?jo charam paap he, hamen usee kii lat he,daihik bal ko rahata yah desh galat he
 The leader immersed day and night in peace, the poet-artist flying above the sky
 yagyagni hind main samidh nahin paati he,paurush kii jwaala roj buji jaati he
 Oh blind luck! Weak unfortunate? Even now open Nayan, wake up from sleep
 vah aghi, baahubal kaa jo aplapi he,jisaki jwaala bujh gayi, vahi paapi he
 As long as this happy, happy, laughable laugh is: where the Khadg, all the virtues reside there
 veerta jahaan par nahin, punya kaa kshay he,veerta jahaan par nahin, swaarth kii jai he
 The sword is a virtue, virtuous, hard to control greed, greed
 asi chhod, bheeru ban jahaan dharm sota he,patak prachandtam vahiin prakat hota he
 Swords sleep where in closed sheaths, fortunes rot in the cellars
 balivedi par baaliyaan-nathen chadhati hai,sone kii inten, magar, nahin kadhati hai
 Ask Kubera, when will they give gold? If not today, when will Suyash take it? When will the storm arise, Holocaust will leave, where gold, bombs will be there, Syat, will explode
 jo karen, kintu, kanchan yah nahin bachegaa,shaayad, suvarna par hi sanhaar machega
 Do not put the burden of your sins on us, say to all, take care of your responsibilities
 kah do prapanchakaari, kapati, jaali se,aalsee, akarmath, kahil, hadataali se,si len jabaan, chupchaap kaam par jaayen,ham yahan rakt, ve ghar main swead bahaayen
 We give him victory, give us strength, two arms and your determination
 hon khadey log katibaddh vahaan yadi ghar main,he koun hamen jite jo yahan samar main ?ho jahaan kahin bhi anay, use roko re !jo karen paap shashi-surya, unhen toko re !ja kaho, punya yadi badha nahin shashan main,yaa aag sulagati rahi praja ke man main;taamas badhata yadi gaya dhakel prabhaa ko,nirbandh panth yadi mila nahin pratibha ko,ripu nahin, yahi anyaay hamen maaregaa,apane ghar main hi phir swadesh haaregaa

 o descendants of the colorful wave of flowers! o residents of the silky city! o image's stalwarts! There is a halahal in the entire country, a hala in Delhi, a light in Delhi, a blind in the rest of India
 makhmal ke pardon ke baahar, phulon ke us paar,jyon kaa tyon he khadaa, aaj bhi maraghat-sa sansar 
 The world has not yet reached a ray, where the horizon is zero, yet Ambar Timir Varan has seen, where the scene still shines in the place, the mother does not get the shame and the child is not coming to the place, where she is surprised to see people Years have passed in the path, where is Swaraj? Where is Swaraj? Bol Delhi! What do you say? Why have you become queen, why does the public suffer? Who has suppressed the fate of everyone? Who had passed away in the house, which house is left in which house is left, this light will be left from the prison and not otherwise the sinner on you! Mahavajra is broken, the swaraj has to be made true, that trust has to be made true, it has to be delivered to the soul, many mountains which are standing in the mug of the block, stop the path of the Ganga, the yards of the Indra, which are adorned, if you bow to them, then you will find fame in the world
 The leaves will be washed away, Is the two-step high ground drowning the two ridges and drowning the crowns? So he will not break the ground without beating him, he will not leave the land for the summer Havrik is left toothless, Ahi is yet to be cleared Shall be slaughtered by Senabli Gandhi over standing there Dushkand Rchen Nasavdhan the nation! This soft vow of affection is a wire tied on both the Sadho Remandir and the 'masjid', the rest is not there, only the hunter who is a sinner is neutral, time will also write his crime
 Right now, Manuj Bhakti is screaming Gandhi's p blood is shouting on Jawahar; Dasyu can create a vicious slaughter somewhere and stand sacrificed throughout the country by offering Gandhi's army! This soft vow of affection is a wire tied on both the Sadho Remandir and the 'masjid', the rest is not there, only the hunter who is a sinner is neutral, time will also write his crime

 Warning the Delhi government to wait till November, Kejriwal said that the days of Dixit are still counting
 november maheene main dilli vidhansabha ke chunaav karaae jaaenge
 Kejriwal said that his fast was for the national capital and not for power
 unhone kaha ki yadi main satta kaa bhookha hota to upwas par nahin baithta
 Describing Sheila Dixit as hostage in the hands of power companies and industrialists, Kejriwal said that this condition cannot continue for long
 unhone kaha ki raajnneeti zyada samay tak udyogpatiyon ke haathon kaa khilonaa nahin bani rah sakati
 Kejriwal also targeted the BJP and said that Congress and BJP are two sides of the same coin
 jammu-srinagar hive par shanivaar subah ek aisa blast hua, jisane 14 farvari ko pulavama main hue aatanki hamale kii badnuma tasviir yaad karne ko majaboor kar diya he
 The centro car has been completely destroyed in this blast and the most surprising thing is that the CRPF convoy was passing by the highway at the time when the car exploded
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki car ne siarpief kii ek bas ko takkar bhi maari, jisase use halkaa nuksaan pahunchaa he, lekin ganimat ye rahi ki javaanon ko kisi prakaar kaa nuksaan nahin pahunchaa he
 This blast Saturday morning 10
 30 baje banihaal ke najadik hua he
 It is being told that the Centro car had 2 cylinders, as well as urea and oil bottles in it
 ab tak mili jaankaree ke mutabik, jaise hi siarpief kaa kafila yahaan se gujara, usee vakt car main blast ho gaya or uske parakhche ud gaye
 The picture of this car blast is similar to that seen in the Pulwama attack
 haalanki, pulavama atake main istemaal car main itani zyada maatra main visphotak bharaa tha ki vah puri nasht ho gai thi
 So far the most surprising thing in this blast is that the information about who brought this vehicle on the highway is not yet available
 kyonki gaadi ke driver kii abhi tak koi khabar nahin he, jisase kai kism kii ashankaon ko bal mil rahaa he
 It is also being said that the driver escaped from the spot
 pulavama atake main bhi achaanak ek car ne siarpief ke kafile main aakar takkar maar di thi, jisamen 40 jawan shahid hue the, haalanki us car main baithe aatanki adil ne khud ko bhi maar daalaa tha
 In the Pulwama attack, CRPF buses were targeted with full planning and the terrorists were successful in fulfilling their nefarious plans
 jabaki banihaal main siarpief javaanon ko to koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaa he, lekin jis car main blast hua, usne siarpief kii bas main takkar maarane kaa kaam jarur kiya
 That is, the buses of CRPF personnel have also come under the grip of this car blast after Pulwama
 haalanki, abhi tak is blast ko aatanki ghatana nahin mana gaya he, lekin isse inkaar bhi nahin kiya gaya he
 At the same time, intelligence inputs are also emphasizing the conspiracy of something untoward
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki khufia agenciyon ne is baat kaa alert diya tha ki pulavama ke baad bhi jammu-srinagar hive par aatanki kisi hamale ko anjaam de sakate hai
 In such a situation, whether this car blast is part of any conspiracy like Pulwama, or is it an accident, it is yet to be investigated
 lekin siarpief ne kaha he ki sabhi pahaluon se is blast kii jaanch kii ja rahi he

 usne bharat aane vaali nadiyon par kai baandh banaae hai
 According to experts, in such a situation, India may also need big dams
 rashtriya jal ayog ke purv chairman eke bajaj ne enditivi se kaha, "sarkaar ne arunachal main aise baandhon kii citon kii pahchaan kii he
 But at many places the dam is not being built due to local opposition

 Sometimes problems get bigger due to neglect
 bharat-china rishton main brahmaputra ke pani kaa bantwaaraa ek aisi hi misaal he
 It is obvious that in such a situation, the path will now have to be rediscovered by looking at the current situation and the need so that a permanent solution to the problem can be found

 sach he kipurush sexuality or striyon kii sexualitike bare main unka ravaiya hamen tamaam saamaajik maanakon ke bare main kaaphi kuch bataa detaa he
 Now see, in the India Today 2005 survey, 66 percent of young unmarried men said that they would not marry a girl who had sex before marriage
 2006 ke survey main yah pratishat badhkar 74 fisadi tak pahunch gaya
 Is the enjoyment of both man or woman in bed important? In response to this question also there was a huge change in the opinion of unmarried men of the same age group
 2005 main iske jawaab main 83 fisadi logon ne ‘‘haa,’’ kaha tha par 2006 main yah sankhya ghatakar 67 fisadi rah gai
 This shows that "gender equality" still remains a matter of concern in persuading people about sexual relations
 yah baat bhi saamne ai ki pichley ek dashak main yuva aaazaad khyaal ladakiyon ko swikaarne ko prerit to hue hai par ve uski aazaadee ko lekar gahare asamanjas main bhi rahete hai
 It is no surprise then that in the 2012 survey, when young people were asked what qualities they would like to see in a potential dating partner, they placed "affection" well above "freedom"
 jis daur main india today ne is tarah ke survey kiye hai usamen sanyog se bhartiya jivan ke sabase khule rahasy samalangikta par bhi saarvajanik bahes hui
 The colonial era law has helped in coining imaginary terms like "natural" and "unnatural" for Indian sexuality
 lekin yah kalpana purushon ke die jawaab main nahin tikti
 Although the percentage of married men who have experienced experiencing homosexuality declined between 2004 and 2007, it more than doubled those who said they had discussed it with the spouse
 samalangikta ke bare main logon kaa pareshaan karne vaala ravaiya 2012 ke survey se bhi saaf hota he
 While a large number of men say that they will forgive their wife for extramarital affairs, such relationships are overwhelmingly negative in response to being gay
 pichley varshon ke aankadon se yah baat saamne aati he ki zyada se zyada mard ab kam umr main apana pehla yon sambandh banane lage hai
 In the 2005 survey, 32 percent of unmarried men said they had first experienced sex at the age of 15 to 18 years
 2006 main yah pratishat 52 tak pahunch gaya
 This shows that the culture of youth is changing and they are getting more opportunities to have sex
 lekin nateezon se ek or ishaara miltaa he: zyaadaatar purush ek ‘‘anbhavi’’ mahila se shaadi ke liye hami bharne se pehle do baar sochenge
 That is, the women will have to carry the burden of "purity" (ie virginity) even further
 pichley dashak main mardon ne jahaan kuch yon varjanaaon ko jari rakhaa he, vahiin kuch kamjor bhi hui hai
 Answers to the question of sexual relations with family members are being received as before
 baari bahumat se naa
 On the other hand, the percentage of youth talking about involvement in group sex has increased in the last years
 sex kii duniya ke badalte samooche paridrishy main bhi ek pahalu lagaataar bana hua heru ek sthaayee sambandh banaae rakhane ke mulya par jor
 Extramarital affairs are common but the number of men who accepted it in India Today's sex survey in previous years does not reflect this
 vastav main 2012 ke survey main ‘‘adarsh sex partnery ke group main ‘pati yaa patni’ ko sabase upar rakhaa gaya he
 Perhaps men realize that sex bargaining is a disturbing activity and what pleases in the short term may not give happiness in the future

 Dentists couple Rajesh and Nupur Talwar received another setback on Friday when their petition was rejected by the Allahabad High Court
 apni beti arushi talwaar or naukar hemraj kii hatya ke maamle main apane khilaaf prakriya shuru hone or saman ke khilaaf unhone yachika daayar kii thi
 Failure to appear in the court, two Bench of the High Court gave separate orders on the petitions filed against the CBI court order in Ghaziabad on February 9 for issuing bailable warrants and initiating court proceedings
 nupur talwaar kii yachika par faisla sunaate hue nyaayamurti balakrishna narayan ne kaha, agar kisi vyakti ke khilaaf pratham drushtatya paryaapt saboot hai to magistrate dwaara uske khilaaf jari saman ko rokane kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 He challenged the order of the CBI court on the ground that the agency never called him for questioning during his entire investigation and neither named him as an accused
 isliye unke khilaaf saman nahin jari hona chahie tha
 The High Court, however, directed Nupur Talwar to appear in the lower court within two weeks
 adaalat ne kaha, vah vahaan apana jamaanat aavedan jamaa kar sakati hai or isapar usee din vichaar ho saktaa he
 On February 28, another petition by Rajesh Talwar against the bailable warrant issued from Ghaziabad court was dismissed by Justice Ravindra Singh
 sibiai adaalat main buudhvaar ko hone vaali sunwaayee main dampati ke pesh hone kii sambhaavna he
 14-year-old Aarushi was found dead at her residence in Noida on 16 May 2008 and Hemraj's body was also recovered from the same house the next day
 rajesh talwaar ne sibiai adaalat ke aadesh ko chunauti dete hue kaha ki vah niyamit jamaanat par baahar hai is vajah se nichali adaalat ko bina is jamaanat ko radd kiye bina jamaanti warrant nahin jari karne chahie
 Talwar's argument was opposed by the CBI and the Uttar Pradesh government and his lawyers said that the bailable warrant is only intended to ensure the accused is produced before the trial court
 talwaar ke vakil samit gopal ne kaha ki adeshon ke khilaaf talwaar dampati ucchtam nyaayalay ja sakate hai
 The CBI lawyer described the verdict as historic
 unhone kaha, dampati ko saman jari kiya gaya he or sibiai adaalat ke saman aadesh ko ucch nyaayalay ne behaal rakhaa he
 The High Court ruled the case and said that there was no legal flaw in the CBI court's decision
 shuruuaat main uttar pradesh kii police ne sanket diya tha ki aapattijanak avasthaa main dekhe jane ke baad ladki or naukar kii hatya arushi ke pita ne kii

 jaanch ke dauraan sibiai ne rajesh talwaar se saghan poochtacha kii or unka narco test or brain masping bhi kiya
 The investigating agency finally submitted the closure report earlier this year but the special court hearing the case said that there was enough evidence to initiate the process against the parents of the deceased girl

 It is also important that on the issue of black money, the Modi government is trying to enter into agreements with all the countries of the world, and the banks whose name is coming in the name of keeping black money, run the same banks from Delhi and Amritsar
 Drug mafias were given several million dollars
 idi kii jaanch se jo tathy saamne aae hai uske mutabik kai million dollar kii rakam honkong ke do bainkon main jamaa karai
 HSBC Bank is located on Hong Kong's Queens Road and Hang Seng Bank is a short distance away
 sutron ke mutabik in donon bainkon se takreeban 10 million australian dollar yani 53 karod rupee drug mafia ko muhaiyaa karaae gaye

 The signs were given in Delhi itself and the ed's investigation shows that the game of black money from the drug trade runs from Delhi itself and has not been cleared yet
 nashe ke kaale kaarobaar ke dhandhe se kaledhan ko kaise banaaya jaataa he or kaledhan ko hawala ke jarie kaise nashe ke kaarobaar ko or zyada badhaayaa jaataa he, yah khel ab idi kii jaanch se saamne aa rahaa he
 For example, how does this game run from Delhi
 nai dilli railway stesan se ek kilometre kii duuri par pahadganj kaa nehru bazaar he
 There is a coffee shop in this market, where till a few days ago a money exchange company named Jai Durga Forex Private Limited was running

 jaanch ke mutabik gaurav gupta melbern main baithe italian mafia ke liye hawala ke jariye dilli se honkong or dubai paise main bhej rahaa tha
 According to the ED, from September 2013 to September 2014, Gaurav Gupta provided Rs 365 crore black money to the Italian drug mafia Peskul Barbaro

 Sachin has made several major deals in Los Angeles through Bank of America and JP Morgan Bank
 yani kaledhan laane ko lekar jo baicheni modi sarkaar dikhaa rahi he usamen sabase bada sawaal yahi ho chalaa he ki jab dilli hi kaledhan ke liye nashe ke kaarobaar kaa centre ban rahaa he or vahi saare bank isamen shaamil he jo kaledhan ko lekar koi jaankaree bharat sarkaar ko uplabdh nahin kara rahe he to phir kalaadhan aayega yaa or zyada kalaadhan duniya bhar main jamaa hoga
