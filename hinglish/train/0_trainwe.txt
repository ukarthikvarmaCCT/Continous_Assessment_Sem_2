 garib bacchon ko iaiti main daakhile ke liye taiyaar karne ke silsile main lagaataar do saalon tak sau fisadi safalataa darj karaane vaali sanstha ‘super 30’ ke sansthaapak anand kumaar kii khwaahish he ki is prayog ko shiksha kii duusari vidhaon main bhi lagu kiya jaae
 Seven years ago, 'super 30' was started in Bihar where 30 economically backward children with potential are selected and prepared for admission to iits
 ‘super 30’ ne abhi tak sau se bhi zyada iaiti ke chaatr die hai
 Anand Kumar, a mathematics scholar who conceptualized the 'super 30', now wants this successful experiment to be implemented in other disciplines of education as well
 unhone iske liye icchhuk logon kii madad karne kii bhi baat kahi he
 Kumar said that i feel that such experiments should be expanded to prepare poor children for the Olympiad Examination of Administrative Services Mathematics and Physics and even for journalism
 sau fisadi safalataa darj karaane vaale ‘super 30’ ke liye bacchon kaa chayan bihar or jharkhand ke doordaraj ke ilaakon se kiya jaataa he
 Kumar said that the scope of 'super 30' is being extended to Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 iske liye nae batch kii kshamta 90 kar di gai he
 He said that this time we are going to select poor and talented children from other states of Hindi belt outside Bihar and Jharkhand for 'super 30'
 ‘ramanujam skool of mathematics’ ke binar tale chalane vaala ‘super 30’ chaatro kii padhai or unke rahane kii muft vyavastha detaa he
 Kumar explains that those children who are not able to bear the expenses of writing their studies are selected for 'super 30'
 unhone kaha ki main khush hum ki hamane kisaanon, otoricshaw chalaane waalon, khomache waalon jaise logon ke bacchon ko iaiti bheja he
 Having published several research papers in mathematics, Anand could not go to Cambridge University due to money problems
 anand kehete hai ki ganit ke ek course main daakhile ke nimantran ke baavjood main paise kii dikkat ke kaaran cambridge nahin ja paaya lekin main khush hum kyonki maine apane jaisi prishthbhumi vaale bacchon ko bharat ke sabase pratishthit course main daakhile ke liye sakasham banaaya he
 Very few people knew Alok Verma before becoming DG Tihar
 unka kisi vivaad main koi naam nahin aayaa tha
 But on 5 August 2014, when he became DG Tihar, controversies started following him
 yahaan police mukhyalay main baithe kuch ipies unke liye ek script likh rahe the
 In fact, something was going on in Tihar Jail at that time which was repeatedly raising him as a DG
 vah shaayad saal 2016 kii ek dopaher thi jab tihaad jail main lau offisar rahe sunil gupta ne tihaad jail se jude ek maamle main ek press conference rakhi
 Perhaps it was the case of some prisoners escaping from Asia's safest prison
 us press conference main 1979 batch ke uti cader ke ipies afasar alok verma bhi aae jo us samay diji tihaad jail the
 Was told that pcs will do the same
 verma hot seat par baithe
 The cameras were ready and Varma was about to speak when he suddenly refused to do PC
 unhone apane saath baithe ek aiji rank ke adhikari ko pressvarta karne kii jimmedaari saunp di
 Well there was a press conference
 uske baad jab maine adhikariyon se poocha ki verma ji ko achaanak kya hua to unhone bataaya ki ve camera friendli nahin hai
 i first saw him like this in a press conference
 vah alok verma kii aakhri press conference thi jo unke bina bole hi khatm ho gai
 He was then the Delhi Police Commissioner for 11 months, but was never seen meeting media personnel or holding press conferences
 tab pataa chalaa ki ve camera friendli na hone ke saath-saath media friendli or yahaan tak ki sabake liye friendli bhi nahin hai
 While he was in Tihar Jail, Sahara's owner Subroto Roy was also in jail, but on the court's order he was kept with the DG office
 us samay tihaad jail main tainaat mere jaanakar kai afasar donon kii gahari dosti kii charchaa karte the
 It was also said that there was a whatsapp group in which a lot of shares were held
 ve yah bhi kehete the ki alok verma subrato roy kii or subrato roy unki madad karte hai
 That is, there was a big lobby in Tihar jail which did not consider Alok Verma as honest officer
 haalanki kisi bhi santhaan main 2 group ban jaaen to ek-duusare par aarope lagaana aam he
 However, Verma continued to make similar allegations on a lobby when he was the Delhi Police Commissioner
 jab ve diji tihaad jail the tab tihaad jail main har roj koi na koi khabar hoti thi
 Sometimes murder, sometimes the escape of prisoners, and sometimes gangs between prisoners
 kuch hi maheenon main 15 se zyada kaidiyon kii maut ho chuki thi
 These were important news for us, but instead of meeting Tihar Jail, the news used to come from Delhi Police Headquarters
 yani khabaren li hone kaa centre tha dilli police mukhyalay,jahaan 3-4 bade ipies adhikariyon kii ek team ye kaam bakhubi karti thi
 Perhaps this was done because Alok Verma should be so maligned through the media that he could not become the Commissioner of Delhi Police
 ipies lobby ke bich ye jhagada purana tha
 Police Headquarters was successful in his plans to a great extent, but Lucky rich Alok Verma came to the same Police Headquarters as Commissioner on 29 February 2016
 unka aana kai bade ipies adhikariyon ke liye khatre kii ghanti sabit hua
 He took the class of Special Commissioner Dharmendra Kumar in the first meeting as soon as his phone rang in the meeting
 iske baad duusare kheme ke special kamishnar dharmendra kumaar or special kamishnar deepak mishra ne apana tabadalaa kara liya, jo alok verma ke aane ke pehle police kamishnar kii line main the
 After this, Alok Verma started erecting his lobby in the police headquarters
 unki good book main kai ipies afasar the, jinhen unke kaarykaal main tarakkee or sammaan mila or jo virdohi the ek ek kar dur hote gaye
 Meanwhile, ACP Anil Chatwal was the most discussed
 kaha jaataa he ki chatwaal alok verma ke sabase kareebi the or sipaahi se lekar upar tak har kisi kaa transfar or posting kaa kaam chatwaal hi dekhte the
 Many used to say that Varma is running the transfer posting industry in association with Chatwal
 alok verma ke bare main ek kahawat he ki jo unki lobby kaa he uske saat khun maaf or jo virdohi he uski ve shakl bhi dekhnaa pasand nahin karte
 After this Alok Verma's next attack was on the media center of Delhi Police, headed by Rajan Bhagat
 verma ko aisa lagata tha ki jab ve diji tihaad the tab unke khilaaf jo khabaren aa rahi thim unhen bade afasar rajan bhagat ke jariye hi plant karte rahe hai
 According to officials, he hated Rajan Bhagat's face as well, so he was looking for an excuse to get Rajan Bhagat out of the police headquarters
 ek din alok verma kii patni dilli police ke kisi family welfare kaarykram main ain
 Neither the media got coverage of the event nor the photo of Alok Verma's wife was properly printed in any newspaper
 alok verma ne isi baat se naaraazgi kaa bahaanaa lekar rajan bhagat ko police mukhyalay ke baahar kamala market krime branch ke aphis main siaro ke pad par bhej diya
 Many in the media called Alok Verma the transfer CP because if many officers of Delhi Police believe that the transfer posting game played by Verma through his close Anil Chatwal was a record in itself
 verma ne apane 11 maheene ke kaarykaal main hajaaron transfar kiye
 Not only this, Verma got the list of the transfer till his last day before leaving the Police Headquarters charge even after the order to become the CBI Director
 sutron kii maane to in dinon main unhone 12 esechao ke transfar kiye, jo aam taur par koi police kamishnar nahin karata
 Yes, one work was definitely appreciated during Verma's tenure, which was the simultaneous promotion of 25000 police personnel after getting the green signal from the Ministry of Home Affairs
 iske liye unhen yaad rakhaa jayega
 According to the IPS officers, when Verma's ticket was cut from the Delhi Police Commissioner for the CBI, he got his wings
 kaha jaataa he ki unhone jate-jate apni pasand kaa police kamishnar bhi lagava diya or is tarah verma kaa sikaa dilli police main bhi chalata rahaa
 People in his lobby are still cutting creamy postings in Delhi Police
 dilli police main unki kitni pakad he iskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa ki unke ghar ke baahar ibi ke do afasaron se police karmiyon ne saream badasluki kii
 His identity was shown in the media but nothing happened to the policemen
 aaj kai police afasar jo khud ko verma kaa sataaya hua maanate hai, naam na chhapane kii shart par kah rahe hai "jo jaisaa karata he uske saath vaisaa hi hota he
 Verma was the DG of Tihar Jail and seems to be going to Tihar again
 " lekin dilli police main duusari lobby he jo is samay sabase taqatvar he, vah alok verma ke hataae jane se behad hataash he
 He feels that now his strength will be less

 Like a runner, Modi has to overcome many obstacles one after the other and gain public acceptance for all the programs he has announced
 unamem ek lambii duuri ke dhaavak kaa damakham bhi hona hi chahie
 By proving political support on the long-delayed Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill, he proved that this stamina is in him

 To emerge as champion, Modi has to win many more matches

 But after that, the pressure to live up to the great aspirations that came with his victory started appreciating
 ''achche din" laane main modi kii aakshamata ko lekar logon kii besabri jyon-jyon badhati gai, chah maheenon ke antaraal par hue teen desh kaa mizaaj surveykshanon main unki sarkaar kii lokapriyata bhi teji se gote lagane lagi
 The NDA seats in the Lok Sabha had come down to 286 in the February 2016 poll and their majority difference was very small
 bijepi kaa hissaa 2014 ke aam chunaavon main use mili bahumat se kahin neeche aa gaya tha
 Worse for Modi was that the Congress-led UPA, which had reached its lowest level after winning just 59 seats in the Lok Sabha elections, saw signs of resurgence
 uske siton kii ginati chunaav main jiti gai siton se dogune par pahunch gai
 There was a big jump in the political fortunes of Rahul Gandhi
 ve modi ke bade chalanger ke taur par ubhare
 Now that Modi is approaching the middle of his prime ministerial term, the good news for him is that the latest opinion poll of India today-karvy Insights shows that the prime minister has come back strongly
 surveykshan kaa anumaan he ki agar abhi chunaav hon to endie ko 304 siten milengiah yah farvari 2016 ke surveykshan se 18 siton kaa ahm sudhaar he
 Another important thing for Modi is that the renewed emergence of Congress and Rahul Gandhi in previous surveys has stopped
 upie kii siton kii ginati ghat gai he or yah 100 se bhi neeche aa gai he
 It is also encouraging for Modi that his popularity rating has jumped from a 10 per cent jump to 50 per cent, while his challenger, especially Rahul Gandhi, has declined in popularity
 tisare morche ke taqatvar netaa, jinhone haal hi ke rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet darj kii thi, chaahe ve pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee hon yaa tamilnadu main je
 Whether Jayalalithaa and Nitish Kumar in Bihar before or Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi, Modi and NDA are not in a position to challenge the topper of the government
 haalanki nitish or kejariwal, 2019 ke chunaav main dobaaraa chunakar aane kii koshish karne par modi kaa muqabla karne vaale sabase taqatvar vipakshi netaa ke taur par rahul se apane faasale ko kam kar rahe hai
 While it is believed that the NDA government has improved its functioning in the last six months, the concern for Modi is that according to the survey, people are not satisfied on important issues like jobs, inflation and corruption (see accompanying reports) 
 bijepi kii siton kii ginati ab bhi bahumat se neeche he, aise main vah loksabhaa main bahumat ke liye endie ke sahyogi dalon par nirbhar he
 That is why Modi and BJP still have to reclaim the land they have lost during their last two years in power
 modi kii lokapriyata main phir se oochaal kii sabase jaahir kiafiyat vah he jise chunavi pandit ''tina", yaa vikalpaheenata kaa factor kehete hai
 If you look at the political plank, then there is no serious challenge to Modi's domination within and outside the party
 modi ko itnaa vishaal or 30 saal main spasht bahumat ke saath apane dam par sarkaar banane kaa janadesh mila tha, to iske peeche badi vajah yah thi ki log sarkaar ke sheersh par faisle lene vaala ek aisa netaa chaahate the, jo upie-2 kii hukumat ke dauraan anubhav kii gai durdasha ko roke or arthvyavastha ko naukariyon or samruddhi ke saath oonchi vruddhi ke raste par waapas laae
 But some of the wrong steps taken on the farm-farming front, the condition and worsening of two consecutive droughts, the electoral defeat of Delhi and Bihar and the notion of being a "suit-boot government", the popularity of the Modi government has gained momentum
 Dived
 haalanki is bich bhi pradhanmantri kii nijee lokapriyata oonchi bani rahi
 Is there no option to be able to fully explain the contradiction of the current survey that Modi and the NDA have re-emerged strongly, but the perception still remains that their government is yet to give results on many important issues Huh? Modi is still seen as the top leader who can pull the nation out of this difficult and trying phase, despite the blame and stigma given by the Opposition's failure to create a strong alternative to the BJP
 to bhi is vaapasi kii kiafiyat sirf ''tina" factor main khojna modi ke saath ninsaphi hogi
 He always leads by staying on the front, while in the last six months Modi has shown that he has learned from his mistakes and has given a fast pace to his government

 He poured huge sums of government treasury into infrastructure projects for roads, railways, ports and housing to accelerate the economy and generate employment

 It is at a healthy level of 5 per cent and gives India the status of possibly the fastest growing economy in the world, at a time when the international environment is not favorable
 acha arthshaastra hi acchhee raajnneeti bhi he
 However, there are also long-standing serious issues that need attention
 berogari khaufnak staron tak bad rahi he or naukariyon ke bagaiyr vruddhi sarkaar ko bharamaa rahi he
 The banks' debt trap is a major cause for concern, which is putting a crisis on the availability of loans
 audyogic vruddhi kii rakrataar sust bani hui he or niryaat kii bhi yahi haalat he
 Companies are embroiled in a dispute over payment due to which large infrastructure projects are stuck in court hurdles

 For this, he will have to provide money to such companies on the guarantee and if he is defeated in the process of arbitration, he has to work with foresight before taking the cases to the Supreme Court
 vaadon ke baavjood kaarobaar ke kaam main sarkaar kii ab bhi zyada maujuudagi bani hui he
 Modi's specialty is that he never gets tired, wants to understand things in detail, has political acumen, and is fully committed to rapid development
 ve khud ko ''pankti main sabase peeche khadaa hone vaala aadmi" kehete hai
 His cabinet minister Piyush Goyal explains that in meetings, the Prime Minister stresses three things: tell me the results, tell me how fast you are working, and how well you can do them
 lagata he, pichley saal modi naukarshahi par nakel kasne main kaamyaab rahe hai
 Corruption has been curbed at a high level in the government and most of the large appointments are being made on merit
 pehle charan main shuru kiye gaye svachh bharat or jan dhan yojana jaise zyaadaatar kaaryakramon kaa parinaam ab dikhne laga he
 Instead of talking nonsense on the occasion of Independence Day, the Prime Minister used this opportunity to present the progress report of the country
 haalanki kuch logon kaa kahana tha ki unka bhaashan jarurat se zyada lanbaa tha, lekin sachaai yahi he ki unhen desh ko bahut kuch bataanaa tha
 Apart from development, he insisted on the "plate test" in the words of a senior official so that people can get food at reasonable prices every day

" " modi kaa yah siddhant ki bharat ko santulankaaree desh banane ke bajaae agrani shakti bananaa chahie or unke is siddhant kaa nateeja bhi dikhne laga he
 At the same time they also have a practical attitude of cooperation with all countries
 padosi deshon, khaskar pakistan ke saath kuch kharaab anubhavon ke baavjood desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan dikhaata he ki log videshi niti ke maamle main unke kaamkaaj se bahut khush hai
 Modi prefers to take the crisis as a challenge rather than shying away from it and when speaking to other heads of state, he talks very clearly, as he did with China's leadership on the nuclear supply group issue
 unhone gharelu lakshyon or videsh niti ke bich ek majboot talmail bana liya he or videshi niveshkon kaa bharosa or videshi nivesh main vruddhi hasil karne main kaamyaab rahe hai

 Apart from this, the way his successor in Gujarat lost his control over the administration is also a matter of concern

 The manner in which he openly opposed the attacks on Dalits on behalf of the guards, has also earned him much praise
 lekin isi tarah agar ve musalamaanon ke liye bhi aawaaj buland karte hai to vishaal hriday vaale netaa ke taur par kahin acha rahegaa
 These concerns are also reflected in the country's mood survey
 musalamaanon or duusare alpsankhyakon ne apni shikaayatein vyakt kii hai
 The survey has been conducted in the middle of the government's term, which may prove to be an important indicator of the government's ability to win re-election
 pradhanmantri ke taur par manmohan singh ke duusare kaarykaal ke madhya main kiye gaye surveykshan ne congress ke netritv vaali sarkaar kii lokapriyata main baari giravat dikhaai thi
 The number of UPA seats surrounded by numerous allegations of corruption fell from 259 in the 2009 general elections to 197 in the August 2011 survey
 congress ne us chetavanee par dhyaan nahin diya or 2014 main use sabase karaari haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 The NDA government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee also showed a similar trend in the middle of his tenure in August 2001
 surveykshan main uski chunavi sambhaavnaaon main baari giravat kaa sanket dekha gaya tha—sarkaar ko tab ausatan 217 siten hi mili thim, jabaki 1999 ke aam chunaavon main use 304 siten mili thim
 Three years later, the NDA had to face defeat despite the vigorous promotion of "bharat Uday"
 iske vipareet upie ke pehle kaarykaal ke madhya main jab surveykshan kiya gaya tha to uski siton main teji se badhotaree kaa sanket dekha gaya tha, or 2009 main usne dobaaraa chunaav jeet liya tha
 Modi seems to have assessed his government in the middle of his term
 ve kade faisle lete hai, man kii baat bolte hai, or vikaas ke maarg par teji se bad rahe hai
 Now again, when the mood survey of the country seems to be going in his favor, Modi should work fast on the main issues, so that he is always seen as the Prime Minister of India and not any particular party, particular region, special As the Prime Minister of the faction or community
 tabhi ve 2019 ke chunaavon main jeet hasil kar paaenge
 To reduce air pollution in Delhi, the High Court on Wednesday said that harvesting will begin after Diwali and then it will be burnt in the fields
 aise main rajdhani ko pradooshan se bachaane ke liye rajyon se batkar ise rokane ke liye kadam uthaae jaae
 The court said that before the pollution coming from areas outside Delhi again pollutes Delhi, the Central Pollution Board should take steps to curb it along with the states
 hai court ne kaha ki punjab, haryana, rajasthan, himachal pradesh se aane vaala pradooshan dilli kii aabo hawa par asar daalata he
 The board said- It is the responsibility of the state that the High Court questioned that when the burning of the crop is banned, then why are the farmers burning the crops? Why is the Central Pollution Board not strictly following this order from the state governments? On this, the Central Pollution Board said that it is the responsibility of the state governments
 'agali dfa upaay lekar aaen'hai court ne kaha ki kisaanon ke liye fasal ko jalaana sabase sasta or saral upaay he
 Why the government is not giving them any other alternative solution

 The High Court is hearing a petition related to the ever increasing air pollution in Delhi
 court ne kaha ki agali sunwaayee par sabhi pakshon se court ye jawaab jaananaa chahta he ki aakhir crop burning ko kaise roka ja saktaa he
 On 22 September, the court will hear the case again
 kuch din pehle neshnal green tribunel bhi fasalon ko kheton me jalaane ko lekar bain laga chukaa he
 But even after that crop burning could not be curbed in the states associated with Delhi

 'aaj tak' ke bade khulaase par apni pratikriya dete hue uttar pradesh ke swasthya mantri siddharth nath singh ne kaha ki koi bhi avaidh tareeke se uttar pradesh main agar medical college chalaayenge to usko band hona padegaa
 Let us tell you that Aaj Tak has disclosed the trickery of admission in medical colleges
 swasthya mantri ne aage kaha, "license kii prakriya main medical council of india kaa role hota he magar main yah aashwaasan detaa hum ki kanoon sakht he or koi bhi college agar is tarah se chal rahe hai to uchit karrwai kii jaaegi

 And people are ready to sell children from door to door to make doctors from thieves door
 mathura ke keem medical college ko bharat ke swasthya mantralay ne chitthee likhakar bataaya he ki aap do saal tak embibies main admician nahin le sakate
 But when Aaj Tak's team reached to know the truth of this order, it came to know that it does not make any sense
 college admician bhi de rahaa he or degree bhi
 This game worth crores of rupees has become a factory of fake MBBS degree
 31 may 2017 ko likhi chitthee main bharat ke swasthya mantralay ne kaale or mote aksharon main saaf-saaf likhaa he ki mathura kaa krishna mohan medical college 2019 tak kisi bhi surat main daakhila nahin le saktaa
 Not only this, the government has also confiscated its guarantee of two crore rupees
 lekin college ne is chitthee ko chaar tukdon main fadkar dustbin main daal diya
 To gather evidence of this, Aajtak's Special Investigation Team reached Mathura as the buyer of MBBS seat
 taarikh-11 july 2017vakt-dopaher ke do bajejageh-krishna mohan medical college, sonk road, mathurakrishna mohan medical college ke admician rum main aaj tak kii team ko ajay tomars naam kaa shaks mila

 Kumar Sangakkara, the great envoy of Sri Lankan cricket and ready to play his last series, described his career of a decade and a half in international cricket as brilliant, but despite winning the finals twice, he is still not able to win the ICC ODI World Cup
 
 cricket jagat kesabse kalatmak ballebaajon main se ek sangakarane apane vidaai samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, 'main 50 overon kaa vishwa cap jeetna pasand karata
 We had two chances but we missed
 agar ham bharat ke khilaaf uski sarajameen par shrinkhalaa jeet jate to yah shandaar hota
 So there are some things that could have happened but i believe the game goes on like this
 ' sangakaara ne kaha ki unhen malaal he lekin inako lekar unki raaton kii neend nahin udi
 Sangakkara, who has scored 28,000 runs and 63 centuries and scored nearly 28,000 runs in international cricket, said, "there are some repulsors but not the ones that i have thought about for years or that have made my heart go sour
 meraa kariyar shandaar rahaa
 i enjoyed defeat and victory each
 achche or bure dinon donon kaa bahut acha anubhav rahaa
 He said, it would have been good to win some Test matches in foreign soil, especially in Australia
 mujhe pichley saal kaa england daura yaad he jab hamane 1-0 se jeet darj kii thi
 It was my best overseas tour
 'apane kariyar ke achche or bure daur ke bare main baat karte hue sangakaara ne lahore main 2009 main srilanka team kii bas par aatanki hamale ke dil dahala dene vaali ghatana kaa zikr kiya
 He said, 'that was definitely a very scary moment for us
 lekin yah visheshkar srilankai team ke liye ek anubhav tha
 Our players were injured and Thilan Samaraweera was shot at the feet and it seemed that he would not be able to play again and even his life was in danger but i saw him come back after a month and a half to score a Test century
 ham is sthiti se baahar nikalne main safal rahe or adhik majbootee ke saath aage bade
 Future plans On future plans, Sangakkara said, "besides, i don't know what i will do
" main abhi do saal cricket kheloongaa or phir apane liye kaam dhundhanga
 Sangakkara, who made his Test debut in 2000 in Galle, called it one of his favorite grounds
 unhone kaha, mujhe lagata he ki gaale ham sabhi ke liye pasandida maidan he
 This was the favorite ground of Muttiah Muralitharan
 hamane yahaan kaaphi test match jite hai
 i think as a player we like to come here because we understand the conditions here
 bharat ke khilaaf srilankai team kii pratidwandvita ke bare main sangakaara ne kaha, yah shandaar pratidwandvita rahi
 It was a fight between some great players
 jab aap aisi team kaa saamana karte ho jiske ballebaaji kram main sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag, rahul dravid, vivies lakshmana or saurav ganguli jaise ballebaaj hon to aap jaanate ho ki aapke liye kaam bahut mushkil he
 Apart from this, there are bowlers like Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan
 maine jitne bhi gendbaajon kaa saamana kiya unamem inako khelnaa kaaphi mushkil rahaa
 It was a really great feeling to play against these great players

 trot ne kaha he ki vah is samasya se ubarne tak anishtikaal tak ke liye cricket se brake le rahe hai
 The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has confirmed Trott's return and also said that he will no longer return to Australia for the remaining matches
 trot brisben main khele gaye pehle test match main saste main out ho gaye the
 England lost the first match by 381 runs
 trot ko mishael janson ne short pich gendon par donon pariyon main out kiya tha
 Trott said in his statement, "knowing that i am not able to contribute 100 percent to the team, it is not right for me to keep playing in this series
 main us str kaa pradarshan nahin kar paa rahaa hum, jis str ko maine purv main chuaa he
 " "meraa ekmaatr lakshya cricket se brake lete hue khud ko phir cricket ke liye taiyaar karnaa he
 i wish my colleagues all the rest of the series
 " The English team management was aware that Trott was undergoing some mental problem and in this regard, Team Director Andy Flower and ECB Managing Director Hug Morris spoke to Trott during the Brisbane Test
 isibi ne kaha he ki vah trot kii bhaawanaaon kaa sammaan karata he or aashaa karata he ki nae saal main trot nai ummid or team ke liye kuch kar guzarane kii ichha ke saath antarrashtriya cricket main vaapasi karenge
 Trott's return home from the Ashes thus reminds him of leaving England batsman Marcus Trescothick's tour of India in the 2005–06 season

 rishi kapur sirf 16 varsh ke the or skool main pard rahe the, jab unhen meraa naam joker main liya gaya
 Ranbir Kapoor was just 15 years old when his father made him the assistant director of Aa Ab Laut Chalen, the first film to be made under his direction
 donon filmein ausat raheen lekin donon ke sitaron kaa udai ho gaya
 Rishi Kapoor, 60, has had the longest career as a romantic hero in Bollywood
 duusari taraf ranbir kapur saanwariyaa se shuruyaat ke baad aise actor ban chuke hai, jo ascharyajanak jokhim letaa he
 There is no element of anger in Ranbir's body, so Rishi has been battling the evils of alcohol and insecurity in the world outside the screen
 phir bhi donon paali hill ke ek acchhee tarah se susajjit cottage main ek chat ke neeche rahete hai
 Rishi and Ranbir took time off from the shooting schedule of their films Aurangzeb and Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani respectively and chatted for an hour in a hotel room located a short distance from their home
 unase baatcheet aisa anubhav rahi, jaise koi dilachasp tennis match chal rahaa ho
 Kaveri Bamzai, editor of India Today, was watching this with fascination
 student of da year ke bare main pratikriya kisi rahi?rishi kapoormein nahin jaanata, aap bataaen
 Ranbir Kapoor: i liked this film
 rishivah isliye aisa bol rahaa he kyonki baap bagal main baitha he
 ranbirme had no hope, but it looked good and fun
 shaayad isliye ki aapke dost karan johar iske diarector hai
 Ranbir but i honestly assess his films
 barfi ke bare main kya kahenge?ranbirajahan tak meri filmon kii baat he, main khud kisi nattejey par nahin pahunchataa
 i have decided to watch my films with the audience and only after that i form an opinion
 maine barfi dilli main dekhi thi
 The audience was quite tied
 aap agnipath ke bare main kya sochate hai? aapako ek aise seen main apane pita ko dekhne main asahaj hona chahie tha, jisamen ve ek choti-si ladki ko lekar itane aakraamak hai?ranbiranhin, nahin
 i am an actor myself
 rishiham jaanate hai ki yah sab abhinay he
 What are you angry about? buniyadi rup se main gussell aadmi hum
 You must have been the Angry Man of the seventies then
 jabaki aap kar kya rahe the? naachna, gaanaa, nitu se romance
 Rishi: All an actor has to do
 lekin vah maje kaa daur tha, khaskar kapadon ke maamle main
 Flare jacket
 aap ab bhi kisi museum main use pahane hue honge
 Debt Jacket? Rishi We prepared a similar loan jacket for the Indian International Film Academy (IIFA) Award, where we both danced
 or in jacketon kii adla-badali hui thi
 i wore a tight jacket and that loose one
 yah to acchhee baat he
 Ranbir does not have much weight
 kya aap isse khush hai?rishivah apni maa par gaya he
 His metabolism is quite good
 ranbirayah bhi baat he ki in dinon log zyada jaagruk hai
 We were not thin, but healthy in sage days
 yah aapke liye ek nayaa daur he: ek bura aadmi banane kaa
 But has he ever shouted at you (question to Ranbir)? Ranbir: No, he has never spoken to me in a loud voice
 kya aap nishchit rup se kah sakate hai? kyonki vah dusron par to hameshaa cheekhte hai?rishinhee, vah diplomatic jawaab de rahaa he
 i was slapped once by my father because i had drank cigarettes from his makeup man at a very young age
 uske (ranbir) saath bhi aisa hua tha, jab vah puja ke kamare main juute pahanakar chalaa gaya tha
 How old were you then? ranbirkarib 12 varsh kaa rahaa hounga
 Before you fell on the bathroom pot and injured the cheek, before that? Hrishitab was just two-three years old
 usne ek tarah se landan main hamaare kiraye ke ghar ko tahas-nahas kar diya tha
 When he was five, he broke the door of the fridge
 ek baar ham ek restaurant main gaye to vah guitar kii maang kar baitha
 He did not eat anything and kept crying constantly
 barish ho rahi thi
 So we had to travel all over London to get him a guitar
 kis baat se aapako (ranbir) acting main utarane kii prerana mili?ranbirmujhe lagata he ki jab main skool main acha nahin kar paa rahaa tha, tab se isaki shuruyaat hui
 i was interested in studies, but going to school i found bored
 jab main neuyork gaya to khud ko lekar zyada jimmedaar hua
 i think every year you become more responsible when you are away from the shadow of family and live life better
 unke neuyork ke chaar saal kaise rahe?rishimeri beti to ranbir se pehle hi videsh chali gai thi
 So we were mentally prepared
 vah lee strasburg theatre and film institute main gaya, jo mere acting ke mizaaj ke anukool nahin tha
 It was a method school
 lekin vah jo chahta tha, hamane use karne diya
 On coming back, she worked as an assistant director with Sanjay Leela Bhansali in Black
 iske baad bhansaali ne use saanwariyaa main le liya
 There was mixed reaction on Sanwaria
 rishipratikriya mili-juli nahin thi, kharaab thi
 Disappointed with this? Rishij When we saw the film, we realized that he belongs to our family and knows his work
 mujhe bharosa tha ki vah sahi disha pakad legaa
 The next film she chose, Bachna Ae Haseeno, was a romantic film
 lekin vek ap cid main uski kaaphi charchaa hui?rishimain uske creative paksh main yaa kisi anya tareeke se koi hastkshep nahin karata
 My choice may not be right for this new generation
 main to kabhi nahin chahta tha ki vah vek ap cid jaisi film kare
 But when did you see Wake Up Sid? The scene in which he opposes his father
 
 
 rishihaan, vah pal
 In fact, such moments only make a film bigger
 kahani to thodi-bahut anaavashyak ho sakati he
 i liked the amazing story of Ajab Prem
 yah meri tarah kii film he
 i always wanted him to do romantic films of Rishi Kapoor style
 kya aap unki garlfrends se mili hai?rishimain nahin jaanata ki koun-si ladki uski garlfriend he
 He never told me that it was my girlfriend
 lekin main yah anumaan lagaataa hum ki is umr main uske paas ek nahin, balki kai garlfrends hongi
 Why this? When Rishija wants to make a girlfriend a wife, then things will be different
 unke kaam ke bare main aapkaa kya najariya he
 Do you share this with them? i don't know
 iske bare main mujhe vastav main dukh he
 We do not have friendship
 shaayad isliye ki mere pita ne mujhase dosti nahin kii
 i love him vah meraa iklauta betaa he
 But she is closer to her mother
 yadi aap aaj kaam kar rahe hote or aapako usee tarah se avasar milte, jis tarah se bete ko mil rahe hai, jis tarah ke diarector ke saath vah kaam kar rahe hai or jabardast script ke saath to aap apane liye koun-si bhoomika pasand karte?rishimujhe raajnneeti,barfi or rockstar main uski bhoomika pasand ai
 i have not paid much attention to the unknown
 kya aapako anjaanaa anjaani film main kaam karne main majaa aayaa?ranbirfilm karte samay puri tarah se samarpan karnaa hota he
 One has to do what the director wants
 ek actor ke rup main aap apni filmon kaa akalan nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, i wait to see them (sages)
 rishimeri patni sabase acchhee jaj hai

 The former Pakistan Test team captain Salman Butt has said that his strong domestic structure has an important role in India's success in Test cricket
 unhone kaha he ki jab tak pakistan main gharelu cricket ke dhaanche ko bharat kii tarah majboot nahin banaaya jaataa, hamaare yahaan ke khilaadiyon se isi tarah ke pradarshan kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati
 According to Salman Butt, who has faced a ban in spot fixing scandal, most players avoid playing four-day cricket in the country
 gauratlab he ki pichley maheene pakistan ko newjiland ke khilaaf teen test kii siries main 1-2 se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha jabaki team ne pichley hafte centurian main dakshin africa ke khilaaf pehla test bhi chah wicket se ganvaa diya
 Tainted Pakistani cricketer Salman Butt said, Cricket can never be free from corruption
 On the other hand, India won the third Test against Australia in Melbourne by 137 runs to take an unassailable 2-1 lead in the four-match series and the border-gavaskar Trophy Pass retained
 apane international kariyar ke dauraan 33 test or 78 vanade international match khilne vaale bat ne kaha, ‘dekhie bharat ne haal main jab australia ke khilaaf test jeeta to viraat kohli ne gendbaaji or ballebaaji main safalataa kaa shrey bharat ke gharelu cricket ko diya
 He said, "india is doing well because their players are only allowed to play in IPL T20 cricket and they have to play Ranji Trophy whereas in contrast most of our players here avoid playing in four-day domestic cricket

 janata sab dekh legi West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is holding a rally in Kolkata's Brigade Parade Ground on Saturday to bring opposition parties together on one platform
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bijepi ke khilaaf vipakshi ekajutata main raajnneetik dalon se lekar bijepi ke baagi or modi virdohi netaa bhi ekajute ho rahe hai
 But there are about 7 such opposition leaders from Congress President Rahul Gandhi to Telangana Chief Minister k Chandrasekhar Rao who will not be seen on Mamta Banerjee's platform
 in netaaon ke mamata kii raily main na pahunchane ke peeche raajnneetik myne bhi chipa hua he
 Before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, Mamta Banerjee is going to Maharali to demonstrate the strength of opposition unity against Modi government
 is mahareli main lakhon logon ke shaamil hone kii baat kahi ja rahi he, iske alaava vipakshi dalon ke takreeban sabhi dalon ke netaa jutenge
 However Congress President Rahul Gandhi, UPA President Sonia Gandhi, BSP President Mayawati, TRS Chief and Telangana Chief Minister KCR and Jagan Mohan Reddy are not attending this rally
 iske alaava odisha ke mukhyamantri naveen patnayak ke shaamil hone ko lekar sanshay barkaraar he
 At the same time, AIADMK has kept distance from DMK coming on this platform
 sonia-rahul mamata ke manch par kyon nahinmamta ke manch par sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke na pahunchane ke peeche sabase badi vajah congress kii pashchim bengal cameti maani ja rahi he
 The West Bengal Congress Committee did not agree to the participation of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi in Mamta's rally
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki rajya kii congress cameti aane vaale loksabhaa chunaavon ko akelaa ladane ke liye taiyaar hai or unhone hi rahul gandhi ko raily main shaamil na hone kaa suzav diya, jiske baad unhone shaamil na hone kaa faisla kiya gaya
 However, sonia-rahul has decided to send senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge in his place
 maaya khud kyon nahinmamta ke manch par basapa adhyaksh mayawati bhi khud nahin ja rahi hai balki apni jagah party ke mahasachiv satish chandra mishra ko bhej rahi hai
 The BSP chief has not appeared with opposition leaders on any other platform except the swearing-in ceremony of the congress-jds government in Karnataka
 darasal, mayawati khud bhi piem pad kii daavedaar ke taur par pesh kar rahi hai
 In such a situation, she does not want to undermine her strength by going on stage
 naveen patnayak ekala chalo kii raah partiemasi kii raily main odisha ke mukhyamantri or bijedy adhyaksh naveen patnayak bhi nahin dikh sakate hai
 He said at the India Today Mind Rocks program that his party's policy is clear, he is walking the same distance from BJP and Congress
 wo donon partiyon main se kisi ke saath bhi gathbandhan nahin karenge
 Apart from this, no such opposition stage has been seen so far
 haalanki, kesiar se lekar mamata tak ne naveen patnayak se mulaakaat kar fedral front main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa diya tha
 Due to Naidu, Reddy created YSR Congress Party President of Andhra Pradesh and Leader of Opposition in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on the distance distance platform
 darasal mamata kii raily tidipi adhyaksh chandrababu naidu ja rahe hai
 It is believed that due to this Jagan Mohan Reddy is staying away from this rally, because he has political opposition from Naidu
 isi tarah mamata kii raily main AIADMK kaa bhi koi netaa najar nahin aaenge, kyonki diemke ke netaa stallin pahunch rahe hai
 In Tamil Nadu, both parties are opposed to each other, so both parties are avoiding coming together on one platform
 jabaki diemke or AIADMK donon partiyaan bijepi ke khilaaf hai
 These leaders will be seen on the stage in the TMC rally, SP President Akhilesh Yadav, bsp's Satish Chandra Mishra, HD Kumaraswamy, HD Deve Gowda, Arvind Kejriwal, Sharad Pawar, Chandrababu Naidu, Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah, Tejashwi Yadav, Stalin, Mallikarjun Kharge, Ajit Singh, Jayant Chaudhary, Sharad Yadav, Hemant Soren, Laldhuvahvama and Gegang Apang will be present
 in netaaon ke alaava modi virdohi hardik patel or jignesh mewaani jaise netaa bhi shaamil honge
 Apart from this, among the rebel leaders of BJP, Yashwant Sinha, Shatrughan Sinha and Arun Shourie will also share the stage
 har insaan kii apni alag style hoti he
 Likewise, the hairstyle of most people also varies
 lekin kya aapako pataa he ki aapaki heirstil se aapke bare main bhi kai chijen pataa chalati hai
 Let's know
 agar aap dahini taraf maang nikaalte hon?- aam taur par aise log shani pradhan hote hai- aise log bade drudh nishchayi or karmath hote hai- parantu jivan ke praarambhik samay main unako khub sangharsh karnaa padataa he- krodh aana or jarurat se zyada ziddee hona inaki sabase badi kamajori he- aise logon ko aayu ke 32wein or 48wein varsh main vishesh laabh hota hua dekha jaataa he- sangharsh se samasya ho rahi ho to yah style badal deshgar aap bain taraf maang nikaalte hon In Aaj Tak's special program 'panchayat Aajatak', Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said that Congress has got Modi phobia
 jiesti se janata khush he
 Modi government imposed GST by focusing on manufacturing state
 tamilnadu, gujarat, maharashtra, karnataka main sabase zyada menuphaccharing hoti he, isliye modi sarkaar ne jiesti ko saral kiya
 Actually, the Union Minister said these things on the statement of senior Congress leader Mohan Prakash on 'GST and demonetisation'
 mohan prakaash ne kaha tha ki, 'jiesti or notebandi se desh kii arthvyavastha ko nuksaan hua
 The BJP has talked big about black money
 baba log takabijepike saath aa gaye
 The movement took place, but the black money did not return
 'bajri cond par tikhi bahesbajri cond ko lekar congress netaa mohan prakaash or kendriya mantri arjuna ram meghavaal main tikhi bahes hui
 Union Minister Meghwal said that the Congress closed the eyes and gave gravel leases to the mafias
 hamaare paas saboot he ki purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne bajri ke patte die
 The monkey was fiercely divided and the people were harmed
 vahiin, mohan prakaash ne kaha ki bijepi ne 6 hajaar se 40 hajaar tak patte mafiaon ko die
 BJP has stolen
 ab chunaav ke vakt main ise wo chipa nahin paa rahi he
 Everyone can see who did the gravel scandal
 bijepi par aarope- dost hi desh kaa paisa lekar bhaag gaevahin congress ne bijepi ko gherte hue kaha ki bijepi ne chunaavon se pehle kaala dhan ko desh main lekar aane kii baat kahi thi
 But contrary to the promise after the election, only his friends ran away with the money of the country

 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal held a press conference on Friday and took on the Modi government, BJP and Lieutenant Governor of the Center over the Delhi government vs Lieutenant Governor's battle
 unhone ek baar phir alji najeeb jang parabijepi ke nirdeshon par kaam karne kaa aropalgaya
 Describing him as the 'viceroy of PM', Kejriwal said, 'before independence, the Queen of England used to send notifications to the Viceroy of this place

 He alleged that the central government wanted to keep only its favorite officers in Delhi

 Significantly, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued the notification clarifying the powers of the Lieutenant Governor

 'the last paragraph of the notification says something' Kejriwal said, 'it is clear from the last paragraph of this notification that the police station of Anti Corruption Branch does not have the right to take cognizance against the crimes of the officers and employees of the Central Government
 jabaki anti karpshan beuro 36 logon ko giraftaar kar chukaa he or uski karrwai ke baad 152 log suspend kiye ja chuke hai
 They want to save some people
 ' dilli sarkaar is adhisuchana ko sanvaidhanik jaankaron ke jariye samajhane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Kejriwal claimed that there was an industry transfer-posting in Delhi, which the AAP government has abolished in the last three months
 unhone kaha, 've transfar-posting apane haath main rakhana chaahate hai
 They want to appoint their favorite officers in Delhi
 'kejariwal ne kaha ki alji ne kabhi unase yah nahin poocha ki dilli ke logon ko pani mil rahaa he yaa nahin, vah sirf transfar or posting apane haath main rakhana chaahate hai
 Kejriwal said that both BJP and Congress want to keep their officials in Delhi so that they can get contracts for their people

 The construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya has once again intensified
 vishwa hindu parishad (VHP) kaa daawa he ki ayodhya main do trek pattharon ko pahunchaaya ja chukaa he
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will also visit Ayodhya on 26 July
 centre or rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar hone se vishwa hindu parishad ko yakeen he ki ab mandir nirmaan main koi baadha nahin he
 Now the work of carving these stones will be done
 VHP ne elaan kiya he ki ek saal ke andar mandir nirmaan kaary shuru ho jayega
 Senior VHP leader Triloki Nath Pandey said that two trucks loaded with stones have reached Ayodhya from Bharatpur in Rajasthan on Monday
 inkaa istemaal ram mandir nirmaan main kiya jayega
 He said that more than 100 stones would be required in the construction of the entire Ram temple
 in trakon se pattharon ko ayodhya sthit vishwa hindu parishad ke mukhyalay karsevak puram main utaara gaya
 The remaining consignment of stones will also arrive in two days
 pandey ne jor dekar kaha ki soobe main ab bijepi kii sarkaar he
 In such a situation, there is no obstacle in the way of temple construction
 isse pehle 2015 main isi tarah ram mandir nirmaan ke liye puure desh se pathar laane kii koshish vifal ho gai thi
 Without complying with the provision of Form 39 of the Commercial Tax Department, two trucks loaded with stones were reached, which was banned by the then Samajwadi Party government
 pandey ne bataaya ki ek maheene pehle commercial tex department ke sambandhit adhikari se sampark kiya gaya tha or unhone fouran form 39 jari kar diya
 Reacting in this regard, the party's advocate Khalik Ahmed Khan said that an attempt is being made to bring a message that the saffron party is serious about the construction of the Ram temple
 haalanki isse supreme court main chal rahaa cese prabhavit nahin hoga
 Khan said, 'we have full faith in the Constitution and the Supreme Court
 'vahiin, digambar akhaade ke mahant suresh das ne kaha ki main somvaar ko yogi se chah ghante ke liye mila or unhone hamase kaha he ki taiyaar rahen
 Temple construction will start soon
 yahaan tak ki pathar aana shuru ho chuke hai
 It is said that two lakh cubic feet of stone is needed for the construction of the temple and so far 1
25 lakh tons of stone has been arrived
 pattharon se bhare do trek rajasthan ke dhaulpur se aae hai
 This was possible when the Yogi government gave orders for Form 32

The Koli Samaj has become angry with the Congress after the young Patidar leader Parshan Dhanani was made the Leader of Opposition through the Congress
 coli samaaj ne aaj elaan kiya he ki 10 janvari ko wo ahmedabad main ek meeting kar kuvarji baawaliya ko netaa vipaksh banane ke liye congress aalaa kaman ke saamne baat rakhenge
 The Koli society demands that Kuwarji Bavaliya has been associated with the Congress for years
 is bich unhone kai chunaav bhi jite hai, isliye unhen hi netaa vipaksh bananaa chahie
 Koli society is very important in Saurashtra, about 20 percent of Gujarat's vote bank comes from Koli community

 According to the prophecy, PM Modi will rule the power of India for nearly 20 years
 bhagwaan kaa uphaar hai modiisase pehle kendriya mantri bhi kai barpm modiki tulana garibon ke maseehaa se kar chuke hai

 ) Ram Rahim, who was arrested in the rape case and his favorite honeypreet, together hatched a big conspiracy to fight the law, it is now revealed by an affidavit of the police
 haryana police ne court ko bataaya he ki deraa samarthakon ke paas se police ko hathiyaaron ke jakhire ke saath-saath ek drone bhi mila tha, jisase wo police bal par nigaah rakhte the
 Because of their misdeeds, Ram Rahim and his mouth bid Honeypreet to go to jail, but before going to jail, both the policemen and the law experts were surprised by seeing the intrigues that they had planned to take iron from the law
 Huh
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki panchakula kii tarah sirsa ko bhi jalaane kaa plan banaaya gaya tha
 Would you believe that both of them together with their henchmen had conspired for large-scale arson, ruckus and slaughtering in not only Panchkula but also in Sirsa town of Haryana, but police and paramilitary He was not fully successful in his intentions due to the deployment of forces
 isi dauraan dere se nikalati gadiyon or gurgon kii chaanbin main police ko kuch aisi chizein haath lageen, jinhone har kisi kaa dimag ghuma diya
 Now about these things, where the police has given information to the court in its affidavit
 vahiin is halafanaame ne ram rahim or haniprit kii khaufnak sajeesh kaa bhi khulaasa kar diya he
 The dreaded disclosure of Honeypreet's plot - between 25 to 28 August the police had blocked many places - including the road leading from the dera to Rajasthan - here a large number of illegals were found in search of vehicles - in Begu area a drone was also found near a devotee of the camp
 The people of the camp were also training to run retired military personnel
 The police suspect that the use of this drone is probably the people of the camp
 During the violence, the deployment of paramilitary forces were seen to understand
 jab unhen ahsaas ho gaya kipulicese loha lenaa itnaa aasaan nahin he, to wo sirsa main thodaa peeche hat gaye
 Police recovered an AK 47, 9 mm pistol and 80 bullets from a Dera supporter
 ek naake se deraa samarthak ko 12 bor kii gan or 13 khaas libaas ke saath pakadaa gaya tha
 Similarly, 1 revolver, 5 bullets, pistols and 32 bore bullets were found at the check point
 sirsa ke 17 linsensodhariyon se bhi police ne 23 hathiyaar baraamad kiye the
 All the things mentioned in the affidavit are sufficient to prove how terrible the plot was

 zyada se zyada yahi hota ki vah kuch suzav maangati or phir usee vakt faisla le liya jaataa tha
 ' rajya ke tamaam varisht naukarshah muddon ko samajhane kii unki kaabiliyat or sulajhi hui soch ke kaayal the or unki yaaddasht bhi kamaal kii thi
 According to these officials, Jayalalithaa believed in working perfectly
 ve bataate hai ki mukhyamantri ke paas ek diary hoti thi, jisamen rajya ke sabhi ipies (bhartiya police seva) adhikariyon kaa record hota tha
 She used to check this diary before taking decisions related to transfer, appointment and promotion of officers and then decide
 tippaniyan Jayalalithaa also kept a close watch on the Tamil organizations and parties doing caste politics in the state, which could create social tension
 unhone 2001 se 2006 ke bich ke apane kaarykaal main apane purv sahyogi vaayako ko hiraasat main lene kaa aadesh diya tha

 jayalalita ke hi aadesh par saal 2013 main piemke netaa ramdaas or unke bete ambumani ko hinsa bhadakaane ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 Getting access to Jayalalithaa was not a matter of everyone's bus
 lekin unke kareebi or bharosemand log ko kaaphi chhot hasil thi, bas unhen kuch karne se pehle ammaa ko bataanaa hota tha
 If anyone lost Jayalalithaa's trust, she was not at all hesitant to take him out
 isi vajah se unhone apni kareebi shashikala natarajan or dattak putr vien sudhakaran se bhi ek baar naata tod liya tha
 All the senior bureaucrats of the state were convinced of their ability to understand the issues and the thought was resolved and their memory was also amazing
 in adhikariyon ke mutabik, jayalalita bilkul vyavasthit dhang se kaam karne main yakeen karti thim
 They state that the Chief Minister used to have a diary which contained the records of all the IPS (indian Police Service) officers of the state
 adhikariyon ke tabadale, niyukti or pramotion se jude faisle lene se pehle vah apni yah diary jarur dekhati thim or phir faisla karti thi

 But his close and trusted people had considerable leeway, just had to tell Amma before they could do anything
 agar koi bhi jayalalita kaa bharosa kho detaa, to use nikaalane main vah jaraa bhi nahin hichakati thim
 For this reason, he had also severed ties with his close friend Sasikala Natarajan and adopted son VN Sudhakaran

 Apart from Sidhu's wife and Pargat, Sonia has currently vetoed the ticket of those who recently joined Congress in Punjab
 sutron ke mutabik, guuruuvaar ko punjab ke liye hui kendriya chunaav samiti kii baithak main sonia gandhi ne vito lagaate hue haal main jwine karne vaale netaaon ke bhavishya par sawaal khadaa kar diya he
 Sonia made it clear that except for Navjot Sidhu's wife and Pargat Singh, all the new leaders who have joined the party in Punjab, their tickets will be considered later
 haal main jwine karne waalon ko tikat diya hi jayega, yah nishchit nahin he
 Sources say that due to the manner in which a large number of other party leaders and mlas have joined the Congress party, there may be discontent among the party leaders that their ticket may not be cut and the outside leaders may have silver
 Go siddhu kii patniur pargat singh kii jwoining main gandhi parivaar kii bhoomika rahi he or unka kad bhi bada he, isliye un donon ke tikat kaa elaan shuruyaat main hi kar diya jayega
 Strategy to stop the rebellion: Actually, Congress is likely to revolt after the ticket distribution in Punjab, so Sonia has taken this step by sensing the danger, so that the old workers do not adopt the rebellious attitude
 ranneeti yahi he ki, bahari netaaon ko puri jaanch padtaal or jeetne kii puri sambhaavna ke baad hi tikat diya jaae, wo bhi baad main, taaki tikat kii chahat rakhane vaale puraane netaaon ko baghawat kaa kam se kam vakt mili or aakhri vakt tak wo bhi tikat kii aas main bane rahen

 Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu, who has reached Pakistan, is giving controversial statements one after the other
 imran khan ke shapath grahan samaaroh main subah pakistani sena ke chif bajva segle milane vaale siddhune shaam ko islamabad main press conference main pakistan or bajva kii jamkar tarif kii
 Sidhu, who enjoyed the hospitality of Imran Khan in Islamabad, forgot the actions of the Pakistani army and praised them fiercely
 press conference main siddhu ne kaha ki main ek mohabbat kaa paigaam hindustan se laayaa tha
 i am taking back 100 times more love than the love i brought
 siddu ne pakistan kii tarif karte hue kaha ki jo waapas aayaa he, wo sood samed aayaa he
 It's our duty that we go back & ask our govt to take a step forward & i hope if we take one step forward, people here will take two steps forward

 com / h5zgxrpcxz — ANI (@ANI) August 18, 2018 Sidhu did not stop at all
 siddhu ne kaha ki general bajva sahab ne mujhe gale lagaaya or kaha- ham shanti chaahate hai
 Sidhu said that this morning General Bajwa came to me and said that we are considering opening the Kartarpur route on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev
 siddhu apane dost imran khan ke shapath grahan samaaroh main shariq hone gaye the, lekin pakistan ke army chif ke saath galabahiyaan kisi ko pach nahin raheen
 No one can understand how Sidhu hugged General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the Chief of the Pak Army, who fired bullets at the border
 aupchaarikta ke naate milanaa-milaanaa to thik tha, lekin gale lagaana har kisi ko nagavar lag rahaa he
 Even the Congress is feeling uneasy with this 'act' of Sidhu
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hui
 The controversy has also deepened over Sidhu's sitting in Imran's swearing-in
 imran ke shapath grahan samaaroh main siddhu pioke ke raashtrapati ke saath baithe najar aae
 pok is the part of Kashmir which is occupied by Pakistan
 pakistan ke kabze vaale jis kashmir ko bharat ne aaj tak manyata nahin di, imran ne apni shapath main siddhu ko usee pioke ke kathith mukhiya ke saath vaali kursi par baithaaya, taaki duniya bhar ko sandesh diya ja sake ki jise hindustan maanata tak nahin, usee hindustan ke ek mantri uske mukhiya ke saath manch saajha kar aae hai
 Of course Congress did not stop Sidhu from leaving
 sarkaar ne bhi siddhu ko tokaa nahin
 But Sidhu's attitude has raised many questions
 imran ke shapath kaa nyotaa siddhu ke saath-saath sunil gavaskar or kapil dev ko bhi gaya tha, lekin donon isse kanni kaat gaye
 Significantly, the President of Pakistan Tehreek-e Insaf, Imran Khan took oath as the Prime Minister of Pakistan today
 is shapath ke saath hi vah pakistan ke 22wein pradhanmantri bane gaye
 Earlier on reaching Pakistan, Sidhu said that Imran should initiate the restoration of peace between the two countries
 unhone kaha ki vah bharat ke sadbhaavna doot ke rup main mohabbat kaa paigaam lekar pakistan aae hai
 He said, 'I have come here not as a politician but as a friend

 As the assembly elections approached, the people have the same question in whose mind is Kashi? Will the people of Kashi give BJP a victory chance? Will Modi wave once again in Kashi?

 Dayashankar Mishra (congress) (44046) bjp's capture of the Lok Sabha In 1991, a wave in the state made Varanasi a BJP stronghold

 During the Lok Sabha elections of the backward castes, when the SP and BSP were engaged in getting Dalit votes, the BJP kept an eye on the backward
 bhaajapa ne 15 ati pichde ummidavaaron ko tikat dekar sansad pahunchaa diya
 Akhilesh Yadav recently inducted 17 backward castes (kahar, Kashyap, Kewat, Mallah, Nishad, Kumhar, Prajapati, Dhivar, Dhimar, Bind, Bhar, Rajbhar, Batham, Turaha, Gond, Manjhi and Fishermen) Has passed the proposal in his cabinet
 upi main in 17 jatiyaan ko votaron ke hisaab se dekha jaae to ye kareeb 5 fisadi honge
 It is believed that these castes voted in favor of the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 samaajawaadee party in jatiyon ke vot paanaa chaahati he taaki vidhansabha chunaav main phayda mili
 It remains to be seen whether the strategy of 2014 Amit Shah and the magic of Modi is reflected in the 2017 assembly elections

 The Indian Army has given a befitting reply to Pakistan by conducting a surgical strike in pok
 purv army chif general bikram singh ne sargical strike par aaj tak se baatcheet kii
 He said that this was the best surgical strike at the right time
 jaaniye unhone or kya kaha
 
 
 
 sawaal:kya aapako lagata he ki is maamle main sargical strike sabase sateek oparation tha?jawaab:sena ne kaha tha ki thik time par, thik jagah par jawaab denge
 It was necessary that action should be taken on the hideout
 See that action was taken against the terrorists
 vah aatanki jo ghuspaith karnaa chaah rahe the
 Sitting on the launch pad
 yah behtareen oparation kiya gaya
 Question: What is a surgical strike? Answer: a target is to be taken
 koicolatoral damege naa hone dena, nuksaan naa hone dena
 Question: Which soldiers do surgical strikes? Answer: We have a special force who is a trend jawan
 yah duniya kii sabase behtareen force maani hui he
 Those who come back by doing good damage
 sawaal:kya khaas takanic kii jarurat hoti he?jawaab:chattan jaisaa majboot hausala, physical fitness, dimagi leadership par bharosa, team par bharosa hone kii jarurat hoti he
 Special forces are prepared inside this teamwork
 ek parivaar hota he
 There is a passion to die for each other
 bhaichara or dostana hota he
 That is why the special force of our Indian Army is very good
 sabase ahmiyat rakhane vaali baat yah he ki vah apane saathi ko peeche chhod kar nahin aayega
 Therefore, the action is such that if he deviates from the path and gets hurt, the team will bring him back
 sawaal:kitni planning kii jarurat hoti he?jawaab:planning kii jarurat he
 If we ever go to an objective in the battle field for surgical strike, what will be the route? What will come to a halt uske liye kya taiyaari kii jaaegi or kahaan se hamaare upar fire aa saktaa he
 And what are the possibilities
 rigerv force kitni he

 Question: Can we do videography? Answer: Nowadays small cameras come during surgical strike which fit on helmet and shoulders

 Videography is very important to deny that
 sawaal:kya fark he, kya pehle sargical strike hui hai?jawaab:karrwai hui he
 This has happened earlier also

 This time you see political backing
 jo bahut jaruri he
 This time, as soon as the Uri attack took place, the Prime Minister gave a statement which encouraged the army
 pehle aise hota rahaa he ki military apane aap karrwai karti rahi he
 The difference is that it is very important to do an operation four to five places and political backing
 isse sena ke manobal par bahut fark padaa he
 Question: What is the role of the PM and what is the role of the NSA? Answer: Everything that begins begins with the Prime Minister
 unhone kaaphi form statement di
 Had it come 10 years ago, Pakistan would have been a responsible country
 chaliye der aae durust aae yah sirf military kii kaarywahi nahin he baaki pahalu kaa bhi istemaal kiya he
 Whether it is diplomatic or a boycott, we are getting support from West Asia
 europe or america kii taraf se bhi samarthan mila he

 unhone aarope lagaaya ki congress netaaon ko nishaanaa banane ke liye bijepi sibiai kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 BJP rejects Congress allegations Meanwhile, BJP has rejected the party's charge of breaking Congress mlas in Gujarat
 bijepi ne kaha ki haal main congress ke chah vidhayakon ke istife ke peeche uskaa koi haath nahin he or sawaal kiya ki 'kya vah bikaoo hai'
 The BJP also said that the Congress's only goal is to save Rahul Gandhi in the country and Ahmed Patel in Gujarat

 For these two days, the schedule of Rahul's visit to Kerala was pre-decided
 aise main rahul ke saamne namakan daakhil karne ke liye 3 or 4 disambar kii taarikh thim
 The advice of many close friends was that Rahul should file his nomination only on December 3, do not wait for the last date
 ye salaah dene waalon kaa tark tha ki 3 disambar ko ravivaar kii chuttee hone kii vajah se media par kawarej bhi khub milegi
 But Rahul himself decided that he would file his nomination on December 4, that is, the last date
 darasal, 4 disambar ko somvaar he, jo rahul ke isht bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana kaa khaas din mana jaataa he
 On December 4, Rahul will first take the blessings of Bhole Baba, then bow to the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi
 uske baadacongress mukhyalayamen jaakar namakan daakhil karenge
 In such a situation, when 'shiv bhakt' Rahul will file his nomination on December 4, it will not be surprising if Congressmen start announcing 'bum Bum Bhole'

 ’ BJP President Nitin Gadkari resigned from his post and dropped out of the race for the top post of the party and Rajnath Singh is likely to be elected the new party president in his place

 After this, Gadkari resigned from the post
 gadakari ne der raat jari bayaan main kaha ki vah nahin chaahate ki unke khilaaf aaropon kaa party ke hiton par pratikul asar pade
 He said, 'therefore i have decided not to claim for the second term of the post of BJP President
 ’ sutron ke anusaar party netaaon kii baithak main rajnath ko adhyaksh pad kaa ummidavaar banaaye jane par aam-sahmati ban gayi he
 Sources said that Gadkari may propose 62-year-old Rajnath's name for the party's top post on Wednesday
 rajnath pehle bhi party ke adhyaksh rahe hai or unhen bhi gadakari kii tarah sangh kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 Gadkari also claimed in his statement that he had done nothing wrong
 unhone kaha, ‘phir bhi samprag sarkaar mujhe or meri party ko nuksaan pahunchane ke makasad se mere bare main dushprachaar karne kaa prayaas karti aa rahi he
 i have always said that i am ready for any independent investigation
 ’is bich buudhvaar subah 9:30 baje bhaajapa sansadeey board kii baithak bulaai gayi he jisamen is saare naye ghatnakram par vichaar karne ke baad antim faisla kiya jayega
 Significantly, the final decision on the new BJP president was to be made on Wednesday and Gadkari was almost certain to hold the top post of the party for a second term
 lekin bhaajapa adhyaksh kii company purti samooh se jude kai thikaanon par iskar vibhaag ke chaape maare jane ke baad party ne faisla kiya ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ko dekhte hue gadakari kaa is pad par bane rahanaa thik nahin hoga
 In the midst of new developments, senior leaders like Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, Rajnath Singh and Anant Kumar took stock of the situation and found that it would be better to replace someone else as Gadkari
 is baithak main bhaajapa ke sanghathan mahaamantri raamalaal bhi maujuud the
 After Purti's case was exposed, senior leader Yashwant Sinha, who has been opposing Gadkari's claim for a few days, on Tuesday evening took a nomination letter and voter list from the party, indicating that he would not allow Gadkari to be elected unopposed
 magar gadakari ke istife ke baad unhone bhi khud ko daud se baahar bataaya
 Significantly, Gadkari is very close to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and because of that he was made the president of the party
 doosraa kaarykaal bhi unhen sangh ke dabaav ke kaaran hi diya ja rahaa tha
 But in the midst of changing developments from Tuesday morning, the Sangh also backed down in the name of Gadkari and agreed to find a middle ground

 Eight of these circles have different targets written
 naukari, nivesh, niryaat, bachat, data or kanoon iske alaava ek he naj (nudg)
 If you look in the dictionary, the meaning of nudge would be to push, but in economy a theory is called nudge economics
 ise 2017 ke arthshaastra main nobel puraskaar vijeta or america arthshaastri richard theller ne pratipaadit kiya he
 In the Nudge Economy, the financial behavior of the people is directed without coercion
 yani sarkaar ek tarah se aapaki aadaton ko badalegi ki aap aarthik kriyalap kaise karenge
 Richard Thaler's book Nudge is read and studied at many universities

 richard theller kii kitaab Nudge kai uniwarsity main padhi jaati he or padhai jaati he
 In 2010, a team was formed in the office of the British Prime Minister with the aim of successfully implementing government policies with the help of Nudge Theory and promoting the schemes at a low cost
 bharat main bhi niti ayog is line par sochataa rahaa he
 Did this theory spread publicity at low cost? tabake mantri rajyavardhan singh rathore ne loksabhaa main bataaya tha ki 2014 se disambar 2018 tak sarkari yojanaon ke prachaar prasar 5,245 karod rupee kharch kiye gaye
 The UPA government spent 5,040 crores in its ten-year tenure
 phir naj theory kaa kya phayda hua
 There is an argument about publicity in this that if the behavior of the people will change, Rajyavardhan Rathore then told that we have not assessed what was the effect of these advertisements
 ek baat aarthik survey ke cover ke bare main karnaa chahta hum
 The last time i
e
 the cover of the Economic Survey for 2018-19 was pink
 puri website hi gulabi ho gai thi
 Then every major thing was told in pink color
 tark diya gaya ki desh bhar main chal rahe mahilaon ke andolan ke prati samarthan jataane ke liye survey kaa rang gulabi kar diya gaya he
 The reason for the pink was stated that the economic survey has been colored pink to support the movement that is taking place to end the violence against women around the world
 gulabi rang karne se mahilaon ke andolan or unki sthiti par kya asar padaa he ye kam se kam is baar ke survey report main hona chahie tha
 The team making the economic survey has easily changed the cover of this bar from pink to blue
 ek nayaa naaraa de diya he blue ski thinking
 It has been written in the Hindi issue of the survey that the economic review is inspired by the broad ideology similar to Neel Gagan
 lekin rangon ke is badlaav ke kya nattejey hote hai, ye ham jaise zyaada research karne vaale ankaron ko nahin bataaya gaya he
 At least the government will tell what the result of the Maternity Leave Act was made

 After the presentation of the budget, the discussion of the economic survey will be left behind, but in Chapter 2 of this survey, the psychological basis behind the survey and the government's plans is explained in detail
 koi sarkaar khul kar is tarah nahin bataati he ki vah aapke vyavhaaron ko kaise badal rahi he taaki aapaki aadaten uski yojanaon main feet ho sake
 By understanding this psychological basis, you will be able to understand the purpose of many schemes of the government
 isliye ham naj theory par thodaa focus karnaa chaahate hai
 Hindi newspapers or channels hardly talk about it, but coincidentally our colleague Bani Bedi has read Richard Thaler's book Nudge, so i thought i would share it with you
 is theory ke swaami richard theller or cas sanstin ne ek kitaab likhi he jiskaa naam he Nudge: improving decisions about health, wealth and happiness
 Cass Sanstein was President Obama's information adviser
 britain ke purv pradhanmantri david camerun ne apane offis main naj unit banaai thi jiske salaahkaar richard theller the
 The cover of this book is interesting
 hathini apane bacchon ko halke se dhakelte hue raste par chalaa rahi he
 In this book both authors are explaining that the name of our movement is Libertarian Paternalism
 patternalism se aap samajhie ki jaise mata pita bachche ko bataa rahe hai ki unhen kya karnaa he kya nahin karnaa he
 People who use idioms in the English language tend to use the meaning of paternalism in another sense
 jaise aap unki life main bahut dakhal den, unke faislon par is tarah se dakhal dete rahen ki aap se zyada unhen yaa maa baap ko zyaada pataa he
 So the answer is that the attitude of those who do this is very peternalistic or petrifying
 ye donon lekhak kehete hai achche makasad ke liye naj kiya ja saktaa he
 Richard and Santine have given it the form of movement
 unka kahana he ki logon ko azaadi hogi lekin unki behatari ke liye zaraa sa saumy tareeke se unke vyavhaar ko prabhavit kiya ja saktaa he
 Because many times people make their decision wrong
 aarthik survey ke chapter number 2 main likhaa he ki kaise svachh bharat mishan or beti bachaao beti padhaao main iskaa safal istamaal hua
 There is a need to understand this economic policy properly
 aarthik vyavhaar or raajnneetik vyavhaar donon hi kshetron main
 The branch of economics is applied economics
 yani log hameshaa taarkik faisle nahin karte hai
 This principle is explained by a Sanskrit verse
 tarko pratishth: shrutyovibhinnanako rishiryasy: matan pramanm
 This means that only rational thinking cannot be considered the ultimate truth because it is also not free from prejudice
 to kya sarkaar kaa kadam purvagrahon se mukt ho saktaa he? isi shloke ke anusaar sarkaar kaa jo satya he vah kis tark se param satya ho gaya
 After all, people have to understand whether the government which is doing it is right or not
 vedon kaa vishleshan nirukt main kiya gaya he
 Has become a sage, Yask
 acharya koun kehalaata he, iske jawaab main yask kehete hai ki achaaram grahyati, aachrati, aachinoti arthan, aachinoti buddhim
 Means the Acharya is one who conducts himself, gets conduct, chooses good words and chooses intelligence
 matlab ki aap dusron ko upadesh dene ja rahe hai ki aapkaa vyavhaar kya ho lekin aapkaa apana aacharan kaisaa he
 Whether Richard Theller and the Santin brothers have given a way for the government to change its behavior
 main bas hindi ke saamaanya darshak or pathak kii tarah gaharaai se samajhnaa chahta hum
 Does the general public know why the government is changing its behavior for the success of a scheme, or whether a robotic society is being created through it, where everyone is being trained to step up
 aakhir kyon logon ke manovaigyanik or vyaavhaarik aadaton ko saumy tareeke se badalane par itnaa jor diya gaya he
 The government is adopting it in the economic field
 i want to see its impact in the political arena
 survey ke chapter do main aage likhaa he ki bharat main jis prakaar saamaajik evam dharmik manyataon kii vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne main mukhya bhoomika he, usee prakaar vyavhaaraatmak arthshaastra badlaav kaa ek moolyawaan saadhan pradaan kar saktaa he

 is prerana se samaaj kaisaa bana rahaa he
 Is the government arguing that it is molding you in a way that what you like, what you don't like
 haalanki inkaa udhaaharan sarkaar apni yojanaon kii kamyaabi main de rahi he, ho saktaa he ki bahut bura na ho
 Bani Bedi said that in Britain, Australia and India, this route also benefits some schemes, but this brings such powers to the government, which can have dangerous consequences
 sarkaar ne apni nitiyon ko lagu karne kaa manouvaigyanik aadhaar bataaya he
 She describes how publicity is being driven through standards of propagation, changing people's behavior
 aisa kabhi kisi sarkaar ne nahin bataaya
 This should be discussed in Hindi regions
 kya sarkaar iske bahaane aapke duusare faisle bhi badal rahi he yaa unka aadhaar garh rahi he
 What if the government starts deciding your choice which is called manipulated in English, then what will be its economic and political consequences
 kya is technic ke istamaal se siyaasi faisle ke vyavhaar ko bhi badla ja rahaa he
 In the chapter with the Nudge Theory, how the message of schemes like Namami Gange or Ayushman was sent to the people to convey the message
 par kya ganga saaf hui, sarkari swasthya sevaaon kaa dhaancha behatar hua
 We have to see if this changes the behavior or whether there is any talk about the government in the minds of the people

 Nudge tabhi kaam karata he jab aap logon kii pansad ko manipulate karen
 Through this, automatic behavior is being created in place of the common nature of people
 jise aap diphalt setting kehete hai computor kii jubaan main
 The government is giving the right to change behavior, but who will take account of this automatic behavior
 koi sarkaar vyavhaar badalane kii kis had tak ja sakati he
 In defense of this, Thaler and Sanstein believe that nudging is manipulation
 par donon kii daleel loktantr main pasand yaa faisle kaa manipulation hameshaa hota he
 We are nudge people but people have a choice
 aap free hai
 Then both say that we will try it by linking it with publicity
 to kya sara makasad prachaar prasar par he, shaayad isliye is survey main puraane naaron kii jagah nae naare aa gaye
 Take the example of Jan Dhan
 iske laabh bhi bataae gaye lekin sapana bhi bechaa gaya yaa log jhaanse main aae ki 15 lakh khate main aanenge
 In whose favor did its political result go? jaise naj theory ke anusaar daawa kiya jaae ki aap swatantra hai ki sarkaar kii new pension skim main nivesh na karen
 But the government has ended its pension scheme
 to phir aapke paas vikalp kya bachaa he
 The only option is for the market
 main aarthik vishyon kaa gyani nahin hum lekin is aarthik survey main koi baat agar bahes karne laayak he, samajhane laayak he to yah naj theory he
 The Guardian has written that this theory became popular with the recession in 2008
 gardian akhbaar ne 1 june 2014 ko likhaa he ki naj iconomix jo pehle ek samaadhaan lagata tha, ab ek plaster jaisaa lagata he
 Like a granddaughter

 Prime Minister Cameron seems to no longer value it
 2010 main britain kii cabinet main naj unit banaai gai thi
 When Cameron created this unit, it was said that the politician will succeed only when the public is behaving
 agar is vichaar ko ham vihaviour iconomi se jodenge to samaaj kaa bhala hoga
 Cameron is no longer the Prime Minister
 camran ne iske bare main california main ted tok main bataaya tha
 If the public behaves the way it is, it also means that if there is hatred for a community within it, then incite that hatred at every level and take political advantage
 yah meraa prashn he
 Now-a-days you will hear that India's economy will be 5 trillion dollars
 niti ayog kii baithak main bhi pradhanmantri modi ne 5 kharab dollar kii arthvyavastha kaa lakshya tay kar chalane ko kaha tha
 The Economic Survey states that for an economy of $ 5 trillion by 2024-25, GDP needs to be 8 percent in a row
 america kii arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 19
 39 trillion dollars
 china kaa 12
 24 trillion dollars
 sirf yahi do desh he jinaki arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 5 trillian dollar se zyaada he
 The Economic Survey states that in 2014-15, India made 2
 1 trillian dollar pahunchane kaa anumaan bataaya tha
 Size of India's economy 1 in 2015-16
 99 trillian dollar rahaa
 Size of India's economy in 2018-19 75 tralian dollar he
 The growth in the size of India's economy from 2014 to 2019 has been less than $ 1 trillion
 2014 main china kii arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 10 trillian dollar tha jo 2019 main 12 trillian dollar kaa he
 a country like China can add two trillion dollars in five years, India less than one trillion dollars
 to ab bharat is baar aisa kya karne ja rahaa he jo agle paanch saal main, modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal se bhi dugana saise kar legaa
 Not even 1 trillion was added, so now how about 2 in five years

 police kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne ke liye ve car yaa train kii bajaae bas main safar kar rahe the, lekin phir bhi police kii giraft se batch nahin paaen
 According to Patiala police sources, on January 23, as part of the City Rajpura police, while searching for all vehicles on National Highway number one, all four were caught with arms and money
 pehle to unhone police ko jhooth bolkar bargalane kii koshish kii, lekin jab police ne sakhti kii tab unhone mumbai main atm cash vine luutane kii baat kabool kar lee
 Security guard of ATM cash van Sadre Alam was also with him

 Significantly, in Mumbai, an ATM van full of money had left for Kashi Mira from Lower Parel, but on the way, the guard posted in the van itself, Sadre Alam, drank the tea by mixing faint medicines

 Elections were won by the BJP and the person-centric election operations or organization operations in the organization got silent approval
 lekin pichley disambar main paanch rajyon ke chunaav main bhaajapa ki niraashajanak pradarshan ke baad party ke andar vyakti kendrit parampara ke khilaaf aawaaj uthne lagi
 Sources say that because of this pressure, the compulsion to organize the 2019 Lok Sabha elections instead of being person-centric was presented to the BJP top leadership
 beete ravivaar ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bhaajapa ne 17 tiimon kaa gathan kiya jisamen kareeb 100 logon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 Leaders like Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Nitin Gadkari, Nirmala Sitharaman, Shivraj Singh Chauhan got preference through Vision Document Committee, Publicity Committee and Content Committee
 abhi tak in netaaon ke samarthakon main yah sanket hi ja rahaa tha ki party kii gatividhiyon se inhen baahar rakhaa gaya he
 But once the team is formed, these discussions will come to an end
 mana ja rahaa he ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) kii taraf se bhi bhaajapa adhyaksh ko yah sandesh tha ki party ke varisht netaaon ko vichaar-vimarsh main sakriyata ke saath shaamil kiya jaae
 It is now believed that after the formation of 17 teams, it is believed that till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP will make full use of the strength of its organization and the elections will be decentralized rather than person centric

 ' The petition filed in the case of CBI Judge Loya's death continues to be debated in the Supreme Court
 shuukravaar ko bahes ke dauraan donon pakshon ke vakeelon ke bich tikhi bahes dekhne ko mili
 Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the Bombay Lawyers Association, put several flaws in the documents filed by the Maharashtra government before the court, but by the end of the hearing, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra has also given a clear message
 justise deepak mishra ne kaha, 'yah baat saaf he ki ham sirf jaj loya kii maut par sunwaayee kar rahe hai or anya maamalon (soharabuddin encounter) par kisi tarah kii charchaa nahin kii jaae
 This warning was given by the CJI when advocate Dave mentioned the flaws in the Sohrabuddin encounter case hearing
 dave ne adaalat ko bataaya ki kaise supreme court keadesh ke baavjoodajaj ne is maamle ko transfar kar diya
 He also said that after Judge Loya, the judge who heard the case gave relief to BJP President Amit Shah in the case
 bataa den ki activist tahseen poonawala or mumbai ke ek patrkaar kii ore se jaj loya kii maut kii swatantra jaanch ke liye supreme court main ek janhit yachika daayar kii gai he

 Senior advocate Dushyant Dave told the court that after Judge Loya's health deteriorated, he was taken to a small hospital instead of being taken to a good hospital where there was no facility for ECG
 dave ne kaha ki shav ko mumbai main parivaar ke paas le jane kii bajaay latur bheja gaya or shav ko kisi aise shaks ne risive kiya jo unka rishtedaar hone kaa daawa kar rahaa tha
 Justice Chandrachud, who is hearing the arguments of lawyer Dave in the Supreme Court, said that sometimes in such difficult times what is right and what is wrong
 iskaa faisla karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Lawyer Dave said on Justice Chandrachud's remarks that not just the behavior of the judges but other circumstances are also pointing towards the disturbances
 maharashtra sarkaar kaa paksharakh rahe varisht vakil mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki jaj loya kii patni ko ek saathi jaj modak ne maut ke bare main bataaya tha
 On this, Dushyant Dave, citing Modak's statement, misunderstood his argument

 Politics on death is not new and leaders think on this issue is the same no matter what the party is
 taaja maamla saamne aayaa he punjab ke purv mukhyamantri beant singh ke hatyare balavant singh rajoana kii sajaa ghataane kaa
 Congress leader Beant Singh was the Chief Minister of Punjab from 1992 to 1995
 unke kaarykaal main punjab main sikh aatankwaad khatm karne kii disha main mahatvapurn kaam hua
 He was killed by Sikh terrorists in a bomb blast on 31 August 1995
 hatya main maanav bam kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 The name of the human bomb was Dilawar Singh, and the person who had to do this work when it failed was Balwant Singh Rajoana
 maanav bam fata or beant singh samet kareeb dedh darjan logon kii jaan chali gai
 Dilawar was also killed but many terrorists, including Rajoana, were arrested
 rajoana par tada kanoon ke tahat mukadmaa chalaa
 Rajoana did not take any lawyer in his defense nor appealed to the lower court against the death penalty
 iske baavjood use faansee par nahin chadhaaya gaya
 Rajoana has become a role model for Sikh fundamentalists
 akaal takht use jinda shahid qaraar de chukaa he
 In 2012, the date of his execution was fixed, but the UPA government led by Manmohan Singh at the Center stayed it
 yahi nahin akali-bhaajapa kii prakaash singh badal ke netritv vaali punjab sarkaar ne court ke faisle ke khilaaf oonchi adaalat main apil kar di
 Rajoana was not hanged
 badal bhi kehete rahe ki sarkaar rajoana ko faansee dene ke paksh main nahin he
 The current Chief Minister of Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh is also turning around saying that he had already said in 2012 that he was against the death penalty
 iske baad sitambar 2019 main centre kii narendra modi kii aguwai vaali bhaajapa sarkaar ne rajoana kii faansee kii sajaa ko ghataakar umrakaid main tabdeel kar diya
 It has been decided by this story of Rajoana that BJP, Congress and Akali have stood on the same ground on the issue of fundamentalism
 baaki dal khud ko alag na maane ve bhi avasar aayega to inhen ke saath dikhenge
 Sikhs constitute more than half of the population of Punjab
 raajnneetik dal aisa soch rahe hai ki kattarpathiyon par narmi se pesh aaenge to punjab samet deshbhar main sikhon ke priy ho jaaenge
 The reason for the softening of the BJP and NDA fundamentalists is understandable that they have been doing politics of religion by nature
 lekin congress jisane dharmanirpekshata kaa jhanda uthaaya hua he apni hi party ke mukhyamantri kii hatya main sajaa paae shaks par lagaataar narmi barat rahi he jo sabit karata he ki wo sirf voton kii raajnneeti kar rahi he
 Even if there was a Muslim terrorist in place of Rajoana, the Congress and the BJP would have been seen standing on the same ground
 inke liye us shahid kii shahadat kaa kanoonee taur par bhi mol nahin he jo aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladata rahaa or isi kii bhent chadh gaya
 This is a rare example of reducing sentence in a trial like TADA
 punjab ke lakhon logon ne aatankwaad kii traasadee jheli he
 Do not know how many innocent people have become the target of terrorists
 desh main haal ke kuch saalon main faansee vaise bhi kaaphi chun-chunakar di jaati he or usamen bhi timming kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he
 The 2017 figures show that there are 371 prisoners in the country who have been sentenced to death
 lekin sabhi kaidi raajnneetik mahatv ke nahin hote hai
 The crime and religion of the prisoners determine their political importance and on the basis of this, they get the benefit of forgiveness or reduction in punishment from the government
 rajoana maamle main phir ek baar alpsankhyak tushtikaran kaa namoona dekhne ko mila he
 How can political parties support or oppose minority bigotry at their convenience, especially when it is a matter of law
 congress dekh chuki he ki teen aatankwaadiyon ko faansee par chadhaane ke baad bhi sarkaar bane rahane kii guarantee nahin he
 Political parties' return to power dictates not radicalism

 goyal ne kaha ki chunaav jeetne ke liye AAP ke netaa jhuthe hatkande apana rahe hai, jo chiz ho hi nahin sakati he, use prachaarit kar janata ko gumraah kar rahe hai
