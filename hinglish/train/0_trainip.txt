 With this, there has been no change in the syllabus and internal assessment for both levels
 sabakuch pehle kii hi tarah rahegaa taaki students ko puure saal sabhi topics ko padhane kaa mauka mili
 With this, students will be able to decide which level they have to choose for the exam
 sibiesai ne yah bhi kaha he ki standard level un students ke liye hoga jinhen aage kii class main maths subject lenaa he, jabaki aise student jo 10veen ke baad maths subject nahin lenaa chaahate hai ve basic level chun sakate hai
 If students fail in any level then they can sit in compartment examination as per CBSE rules
 sibiesai ne apane notification main yah bhi bataaya he ki board pariksha main maths main fail hone par student compartment pariksha ke liye apana level badal sakate hai
 If a student fails in the standard level, then he / she can take compartment examination of any standard or basic level
 yahi nahin, board main paas hone ke baad bhi student ke paas hone ke baad bhi apana str sudhaarney kaa mauka hoga
 That is, if a student passes the basic maths in the board, then he can also sit in the standard math compartment examination

 The BJP indicated that it may take disciplinary action against Ram Jethmalani
 vah party adhyaksh nitin gadakari kaa istipha maang chuke hai or sibiai ke nae nideshak kii niyukti par party ke rukh se sahamat nahin hai
 Party spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said, "jethmalani has been making rhetoric against the BJP president and now there are talks against both the leaders of the opposition
" ham inke khilaaf unke aaropon kaa puri tarah khandan karte hai
 The party has taken strict note of their statements and strict action will be taken at the appropriate time
 ’ In a letter to Nitin Gadkari, Jethmalani criticized Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley for noting that he had written a letter to the Prime Minister against the appointment of Ranjit Sinha as the new head of the CBI
 
 tippaniyan Sushma and Jaitley mentioned that Sinha was appointed despite the unanimous recommendation of the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha on the Lokpal that the CBI Director should be appointed by the collegium
 hossain ne kaha, ‘jethmalani ne bhaajapa adhyaksh ko patr likhaa he jisamen unhone sushamaa or jetali ke khilaaf baaten kahi hai

 Hussain said, "jethmalani has written a letter to the BJP president in which he has spoken against Sushma and Jaitley

 ’ In the battle for the Lok Sabha elections, all the parties have come down completely
 usee kram main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh matdaan prakriya main logon kii hissedari badhaane ke liye jaagrukta abhiyaan chalaayenge
 The first phase of Lok Sabha elections is to be held on April 11
 aise main agle do se teen dinon main bijepi soshal media par ab 100 pratishat matdaan ke liye jaagrukta abhiyaan chalaaegi
 After the code of conduct came into force, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also appealed to big personalities from different regions to vote, so that democracy can be strengthened
 ab party bade str par 100 pratishat matdaan ke liye jaagrukta abhiyaan chalaakar apni party ke paksh main maahaul banane ke saath apni party kaa vot share badhaane ke liye muhim chalaaegi
 On the one hand, BJP is making every effort to increase the party's vote share by running an awareness campaign on social media about 100 percent voting
 vahiin duusari taraf aresas bhi apane swayamsevakon ke jariye ghar ghar main jaakar 100 pratishat matdaan ke liye or nota ke khilaaf prachaar saamagree baantkar jaagrukta abhiyaan chalaaegaa
 Anyway, last year in Delhi, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said in the three-day 'vision of the Union of India of the Future' program that the Sangh favors 100 percent voting in the elections
 sangh matdaan main nota ke praavdhaan ke kilaaf he
 The Sangh believes that NOTA should be scrapped in the election and the best person should be chosen from among the candidates
 mohan bhagwat ne ye bhi kaha tha nota se vyakti apane mat adhikaar kaa galat prayog karata he
 BJP and the Sangh are going to conduct awareness campaigns on social media and door to door for 100 percent voting
 iskaa matlab saafe he ki 2019 kaa chunaav jeetne ke liye party or sangh aidi chotii kaa jor lagaakar ek baar phir se satta par qaabiz hona chaahate hai
 Because the issues related to ideology are yet to be implemented by imposing a government seal

 In 2018, Jahnavi Kapoor, the elder daughter of Sridevi and Boney Kapoor, is all set to make her Bollywood debut with the film Dhadak
 is par logon ke dilon main yah sawaal bhi he ki kya jahanvi kapur apni maa shridevi kii tarah behtareen adaakara sabit ho sakengi
 Recently, Boney Kapoor answered this question in an interview
 unhone kaha ki jahanvi kapur kaa apana ek vyaktitv he
 She will never try to copy her mother in films
 mujhe puri ummid he ki jab log use screen par dekhenge to wo yah nahin kahenge ki jahanvi apni maa kii tarah adaakaari kar rahi he
 Jahnavi will make people know that she is something other than Sridevi's daughter from her first film
 shridevi kii lip surgery ne cheharaa kiya kharaab, ab dikhti hai aisebony kapur ne apni baat ko aage badhaate hue kaha, agar jahanvi ko darshakon ke bich apni ek khaas jagah banani he to use apana anokhaa andaaj dikhaakar sabakaa dil jeetna hoga
 She is very hardworking and has her own understanding
 mujhe puri ummid he ki wo logon ko niraash nahin karegi
 Where did Jahnavi Kapoor come to have dinner with reel lover Ishaan Khattar, when Boney Kapoor was asked how the shooting of Jahnavi's first film was going, he said, 'when the shooting of Dhadak started, i was in Udaipur for a few days
 film kii shooting kaaphi acchhee chal rahi he or jahanvi bhi acha kaam kar rahi he
 While i was there, a song from the film was being shot, in which Jahnavi looked very good
 aapako bataa den ki ishan or jahnavi film 'dhadak' kii shooting kar rahe hai
 'dhadak' is a Hindi remake of the Marathi film 'sairat'
 yah jahnavi kii debyue film bhi he
 There are reports that Sridevi may be seen in the role of Jahnavi's mother in Dhadak
 'main maanata hum ki sarkaar kii soch saath hi saath media ke logon kii soch main paardarshita honi chahie
 News printed that in democracy it is not the only thing
 'yah vachan he pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa
 The Prime Minister who gives a recorded interview of one and a half to one and a half hours to look and appear like news in the media
 jinaki sarkaar ne media main vigyaapan dene ke liye janata ke hazaron karod rupee phoonk die
 The Prime Minister is saying that the publication of news is not the only thing in a democracy
 duniya ke sabase bade loktantr ke pradhanmantri kii news ko lekar yah soch daraane vaali he
 The Prime Minister has said this to Ravish Tiwari and Rajamkal Jha of the Indian Express
 yah intervyuu 12 may ko chapa he
 In this interview, the Prime Minister lectures the Indian Express many times about journalism
 express ke patrkaar counter sawaal nahin karte hai
 He seems to have called the express to listen
 ve yah nahin bataate hai ki express kii koun si khabar galat thi magar yah bataanaa nahin bhoolatey hai ki koun si khabar usne nahin kii
 a Prime Minister says that the publication of news is not the only work in a democracy, it is scary
 aapako darana chahie ki phir janata kitne andhere main hogi
 In any democracy, you can evaluate the government only when the media is independent
 agar media swatantra nahin he to aap kin soochnaaon ke aadhaar par sarkaar kaa moolyankan kar paaenge
 In such a situation, when the Prime Minister can say that the publication of news is not the only work
 agar aap is baat ke liye pradhanmantri kaa samarthan karte hai to zarur aapane loktantr ke satyanaash kaa thik se sapana dekh liya hoga
 In my opinion, the Prime Minister has insulted the spirit of the Constitution on which democracy of India stands by saying this
 bagair soochna or sawaal ke aap loktantr main naagarik ho hi nahin sakate hai
 Please show it
 yah dar hi hoga ki express ne is line ko hedline main jagah nahin di
 a newspaper like Verna Express does not miss this
 duniya bhar main media ko dabaaya ja rahaa he
 It was over in India
 indian express main ek se ek photographer hai
 Amazing, a file photo has been put in this interview
 apni tasveeron ko lekar sajag rahane vaale pradhanmantri ko photographer se parhez kyon ho gaya
 The Khan Market, which the Prime Minister has identified as a gang, does not know that many of his ministers and party leaders are seen walking there
 godi media ke patrkaar vahaan coffee pine jate hai
 Go shopping there
 pradhanmantri ko apana virdohi gang nazar aata he
 Award comeback gang, piecemeal gang and Khan Market gang
 90 pratishat media spes main pradhanmantri kii vandana hoti he
 Even after this, they want to show imagination of a gang and show themselves poor
 jaise duniya unke peeche padi he
 From farmers to unemployed, they are being questioned
 kya ye log bhi khan market gang ke sadsy hai? kya pradhanmantri khan market gang ke prabhaav main badalon ke bich se radar se bachate hue jahaaz le jane vaala bayaan de rahe hai?har sarkaar apane aas-paas satta tantra kaa kuleen gheraa bana leti he
 If Modi has broken the old circle then he has also made a new circle
 unka gang khan market main na rahata ho lekin media se lekar baliwood main jo gang he uskaa kirdaar us gang se alag nahin he jo kathith rup se khan market main rahata he
 Is the dock media not acting like a gang for the Prime Minister? Doesn't the Prime Minister's language about the news seem to be the language of the gang chief? Look at his interview given to the News Nation after the Indian Express
 deepak chaurasia unase kavita sunaane kaa aagrah karte hai
 Modi points to his table that the file must be lying here, has written a poem today
 uske baad aglaa shaat dikhataa he ki file unki god main he
 Stopping the shot at that place shows that the poem question is written on the paper
 jise deepak chaurasia ne poocha he
 The public and BJP supporters ask themselves a question
 pradhanmantri intervyuu de rahe hai yaa jhansa de rahe hai?kya aap aisa intervyuu dekhnaa chahenge jisamen sawaal pehle se tay hon? pradhanmantri ke intervyuu ko lekar pehle se is tarah ke sawaal hote rahe hai
 But when the lie increases, the truth comes on
 5 saal baad hi sahi lekin ab to isaki pushti ho gai ki pradhanmantri live intervyuu to nahin hi dete hai, intervyuu dene se pehle sawaal manga lete hai or jawaab dene ke baad edit karavaate hai
 Was the edited interview even passed on to the Prime Minister's team before it was shown on the channel? The Prime Minister, who started in Delhi's politics, was given an open interview
 bina likhe hue padhate hai
 For this, the middle class used to make fun of Manmohan Singh
 kahata tha ki bolne vaala pradhanmantri chahie
 The same Prime Minister is now speaking through teleprameters at rallies
 pehle se tay sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahe hai
 The question of keeping the purse from the Prime Minister is as historical as the question of fakery
 pradhanmantri kahani banane main master hai
 They know that the public has not received a good education
 use koi bhi kahani bech do,janata yakeen kar legi
 Allegedly, the Khan Market gang in Delhi may criticize the fact that being cloudy will not catch the ship's radar, this is nonsense and should not be said to the Prime Minister as the world will laugh
 lekin ho saktaa he kiam janata ko lage ki are vaah, hamaare pradhanmantri ko kitna dimaag he
 The Air Force, which has not understood so much till date, if Modi does not live then the Air Force will start pulling the fighter aircraft with the bull
 unhen to udaana bhi nahin aata hoga
 'I first used a digital camera in 87-88
 us samay bahut kam logon ke paas email nahin rahata tha
 i had a meeting of Advani
 maine digital camera par adwani ji kii photu lee
 Then the digital camera was so big, i had it
 maine dilli ko transmit kar di
 Advani was surprised how my picture was printed in Delhi today
 'bharat main internet seva 15 agast 1995 ko shuru hui thi
 Modi ji is saying that in 87-88, he sent the picture to Delhi via email
 kya email kaa avishkaar bhi modi ji ne hi kiya tha
 Which newspaper was emailed to? It is sad
 janata or samarthakon ne pradhanmantri ko pyaar se vot kiya he
 Prime Minister Modi should not insult his intelligence
 pradhanmantri desh or videsh main rahane vaale apane samarthakon kaa bhi mazaaq uda rahe hai
 Many of his supporters revolve around the fact that he is supporting a well-educated person
 kam se kam ve pappu nahin hai
 But with this answer, only the supporters should tell what the definition of Pappu is for them
 kyon pradhanmantri modi ko kahani banane kii zarurat padati he? kyon unhen jhooth bolnaa padataa he? kyon modi ko kahana padataa he ki news chapana hi loktantr main sirf ek chiz nahin he?disclemur (asveekaran):is aalekh main vyakt kiye gaye vichaar lekhak ke nijee vichaar hai

 'he said,' This is a very prestigious position and a player is selected for this only by playing a lot, but it all happens to reach the top position anywhere in life
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘pichley do varsh main team kaa cheharaa badla he or kai naye chehron ne jagah banaai he
 i still believe that there is a lot i can do as a player and as a captain
 maine jo bhi faisla kiya, cricket australia kii raay mere dimag main hameshaa sabase aage rahi
 i always kept the interest of the team in front of me
 mitron main panter ke naam se mashhoor ponting ne kaha, ‘pichley saptaah yah jaanakar acha laga ki cricket australia or chayankartaaon ne captain ke pad par meraa anumodan kiya, lekin yahi vah vakt he, jab aane vaale kuch din mere liye mahatvapurn hai
 i really have to decide what i think is right for myself and the team to move forward
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mere paas ek khilaadi or captain ke taur par team ko dene ke liye bahut kuch he
 When i first came to the team, there were many experienced people around me, luckily to understand about international cricket
 ’tasmania ke ballebaaj ne kaha ki vah yah sunishchit karnaa chaahate hai ki philip hayuj, steve smith or osman khwaja jaise yuva khilaadiyon ke aasapaas bahut se anbhavi khilaadi hai, taaki vah unke anubhav se phayda uthaa saken

 agar main samajhataa hum ki mere ran banane se team jitati he or yuva khilaadiyon ko bhi phayda hota he to mujhe lagata he ki abhi khelnaa chahie
 Former Australian captain Kim Husey said that Ponting is following in the footsteps of India's great batsman Sachin Tendulkar, who has developed himself as a player after leaving the captaincy

 maharashtra sarkaar ne fasalon kii kharid ke maamle main kaaphi sakhti baratate hue yah niyam bana diya he ki nunatam samarthan mulya (MSP) se kam keemat par agar koivyapaareekhrid karte pakadaa jayega to use ek saal kii jail kii sajaa hogi
 It is important to note that only one month is left for the Kharif season crop

 If someone is caught doing so, he may face a jail term of one year and a fine of Rs 50,000
 indian express ke anusaar, buudhvaar ko ek cabinet meeting ke baad rajya sarkaar ne maharashtra agricultural produs marketing act main sanshodhan ko manjuuri de di he
 This will mean that there will be no separate determination of such 'market area' where commodities are bought and sold
 isaki jagah ab puure rajya ko hi ek bazaar mana jayega or vyapaariyon ko kisi apiemasi bazaar main kaarobaar ke liye alag se license lene kii jarurat nahin hogi
 This means that it is also a kind of convenience for traders

 This will also provide better prices to the farmers
 abhi tak bazaar main mandi yaa anya kaarnon kaa hawala dekar aksar vyapaaree emspi se bhi kam keemat par kisaanon kii fasal kharid lete the
 The responsibility of implementing the new MSP policy of the government will now be not only the government procurement agencies, but also the private traders
 iskaa kisaanon ko kaaphi phayda mil saktaa he
 For example, tur dal is currently being sold in markets like Akola, Latur and Amravati in Maharashtra for Rs 3,600 to Rs 3,700 per quintal
 yah centre sarkaar dwaara tay emspi 5,675 rupee se kaaphi kam he
 During the peak season last year, oilseeds were selling between Rs 2,600 and Rs 2,700 per quintal, while the MSP was fixed at Rs 3,050

 Fueled by the air strike, Pakistan today claimed to have successfully tested a 'smart weapon' with an indigenously developed extended range from the JF17 Thunder fighter aircraft
 pakistan kaa daawa he ki is pareekshan ke saath ab ladaaku vimaan ko din or raat main behad sateekta ke saath lakshya saadhane main sakasham ho jaaenge
 The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) also said that the experiment is a milestone for the country as the weapon has been developed by indigenous efforts by Pakistani scientists and engineers
 jeef 17 thunder vimaan china kii madad se taiyaar kiya gaya he
 The PAF has claimed that successful experimentation has given the JF17 Thunder the ability to hit a wide range of targets with great accuracy day and night

 Pakistan has conducted this test at a time when the relations between the two countries have worsened in the last two decades
 pulavama hamale ke baad bharat ke jaanbaaj payalton ne pakistan kii maand main ghuskar aatankiyon par air strike kii thi
 Pakistani aircrafts could not even get the air of this strike in this air strike that took place between three and four o'clock in the night
 bhartiya vayusena ke jaanbaaj payalton ne mig 21 se pakistan ke balakot main jaish sargana masood ajahar ke aatankiyon ko unke anjaam tak pahunchaaya tha
 Pakistan may not have even dreamed about India's air strike
 puri duniya main to us samay pakistan kii kirakiri hui hi thi, pakistan ko apni avam ko jawaab dena tak mushkil ho gaya tha
 Its hallmark was seen when Pakistan's defense minister and foreign minister came to the press the day after the attack
 patrakaron ke sawaalon par pakistan ke rakshaamantri parvej khatter ne kaha ki andhere kii vajah se hamaari vayusena karrwai nahin kar pai
 Our Air Force was also ready
 phir aisi karrwai hui to ham jawaab denge

 But in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, a groom had more greed for dowry than his sharik-e-hayat
 isaki keemat use naa sirf fajihat jhelkar chukaai balki tay taarikh se chaar din pehle court main shaadi bhi kerani padi
 What was the matter? Chanchala Kumar of Dhanauti village of Muzaffarpur was married to Pawan of parsauni-rais village of Sahebganj
 gaanv ke naam ke saath bhale hi rais judaa ho, lekin pawan kaa dil dulhan ke maamle main garib tha
 During the ritual of Tilak on April 24, the girls gave a lot of goods in dowry
 pehle se tay 1 lakh kii rakam main se 70 hajaar bhi chukaaye
 But instead of thanking Pawan reached his in-laws house
 usne naa sirf saamaan ko kharaab bataaya balki bakaayaa nagad rakam bhi maangane laga
 Shamatlik came to the in-laws but this in-law was different
 ladki ke parivaaravaalon ne uski minnaten karne ke bajaae duulhe ko bandhak bana liya
 Just four days before the wedding, how would the groom's family sit silent on this ruckus? The quarrel reached the panchayat growing
 panchon ke saamne ladki ke parivaar ne shaq jaahir kiya ki pawan shaadi se mukar bhi saktaa he
 So the panchayat ordered her to marry in court on 26 April itself

 The girl's mother Mita Devi expressed her happiness over the decision of the panchayat

 assam ke mantri himanta biswa sarama ne kaha ki neshnal register of citigens (NRC) asamiya samaaj ke liye "red letters" ke rup main nahin dekha ja saktaa he
 The BJP leader indicated that he had little confidence that the list would help in getting rid of foreigners
 sarama ne shuukravaar ko local patrakaron se kaha, ''draft ke aane ke baad hamane enarasi ke vartmaan paridrishy ko dekhte hue aashaa kho di he
 When many true Indians have gone out of this, how can you claim that this document is a red letter to the Assamese society
 ''unhone kaha, ''south salamara or dhubri kii tarah bangladesh kii seemaa vaale jilon main, baahar nikaale jane kii dar sabase kam he or bhumiputra jile main, yah adhik he
 How can this happen? We are no longer interested in this NRC
 '' himanta biswa sarama ne kaha, ''bangladeshiyon ko baahar nikaalane ke liye enarasi koi quarterfinal, semifinal or final nahin he
 Wait a while and you will see more finals under BJP rule
 ''bataa den ki assam main nagarikon kii antim suchi aaj subah 10 baje online prakashit kar di jaaegi
 After appearing in this list, it will be clear how many of the 41 lakh people who were left out of the draft of the list last year are able to make a place in the final list
 list main jinka naam hoga vahi desh ke naagarik maane jaaenge or jinka naam nahin hoga wo videshi maane jaaenge
 Before the publication of the list, the Assam Police has prepared to prevent the spread of rumors in the state
 suraksha ke maddenzar rajya ke kai ilaaqon main dhara 144 bhi lagaai gai he
 Arrangements have also been made for those whose names will not be in the final list
 enarasi kii final list ke prakaashan se pehle assam ke mukhyamantri sarbanand sonoval ne logon se kaha ki ve ghabaraaen nahin rajya sarkaar apni naagarikta sabit karne main un logon ko madad karne ke liye harsambhav kadam uthaaegi jo vastav main bhartiya hai
 Sonowal also assured to provide legal aid to these people
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki shanivaar ko prakashit hone vaali enarasi kii antim suchi se yadi kisi kaa naam baahar rah jaataa he, to iskaa yah arth nahin he ki vah videshi ban gaya he
 Because after proper legal process, only the Foreign Tribunal (FT) can take a decision in this regard
 unhone kaha, 'kisi ko chintaa karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 No need to panic
 sarkaar sabhi kaa dhyaan rakhegi
 Those who will be excluded from the final list will also get full opportunity to prove their citizenship

 kendriya krishi mantri radhamohan singh ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki bajet(budget 2019) desh ke kisaanon ko samarpit hoga, kyonki sarkaar ne 2022 tak kisaanon kii aay doguni karne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 In a conference organized by Crop Care Federation of India (CCFI) here, the Agriculture Minister said, “it is a matter of pride that India has become one of the leading economies in the agricultural sector due to the implementation of various agricultural projects
 " unhone kaha ki krishi kshetra main nivesh ko badhaava dene ke makasad se sarkaar dwaara liye gaye faislon se is kshetra main badlaav aayaa he or aagaamee bajet kisaanon ko samarpit hoga
 He said that the budgetary allocation of the Ministry of Agriculture during the previous government 2009-2014 1
 21 lakh karod rupee rakhaa tha, jabaki modi ne ise badhaakar 2014-19 ke dauraan 2
 11 lakh crores
 isse pehle bhi sutron kaa kahana tha ki is bajet main modi sarkaar aam aadmi, yani madhyam varg ko khaasi raahat de sakati hai
 It was being told that apart from having an election budget, this decision also interferes with the fact that shortly before the BJP has lost power in three important states to the Congress, and now they have more options left to help the middle class

 Apart from this, the limit of tax-free income to be given on investment under Section 80C of Income Tax Act is also 1

 The Modi government at the Center has set a target of March 2019 to provide electricity to every household in the country
 bijli utpaadan or vitaran ke kshetra main haalanki modi sarkaar kii kavayad yaheen puri nahin hoti
 Along with achieving this goal, the Modi government is now working on a plan to provide electricity to every household in neighboring country Bangladesh by 2022
 modi sarkaar ne apni ‘padosi pehle’ (nebarhud first) kii niti ke tahat padosi deshon ke saath urja kaarobaar ko centre main rakhane kii pahal karte hue bangladesh kii urja jaruraton ke puraa karne kii disha main kadam uthaaya he
 Under this policy, both countries are currently trading 660 MW of electricity
 2017 membangladesh kii pradhanmantrisheekh hasina ke bharat daure ke samay pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 500 megawatt atirikt bijli dene kaa prastaav diya tha
 Apart from government companies, private sector companies are also working in this exercise to strengthen bilateral relations by illuminating the neighboring countries of Modi government
 adani power ne bhi jharkhand sthit apane koyala aadhaarit sanyantr se bangladesh cobijlisplai karne kaa prastaav diya he
 At the same time, plans are being made to supply about 2000 MW of power to Bangladesh from solar parks being built in partnership with government and private sector in Gujarat and Rajasthan
 gauratlab he ki bangladesh kii shaikh hasina sarkaar ne 2022 tak har ghar main bijli pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 For this, for the past few years, Bangladesh made many efforts to generate energy but in most of the efforts, it did not succeed as expected
 bangladesh main sattarudh avami lig ne 2014 ke aam chunaavon main apane menifesto ke jariye vaada kiya tha ki vah 2022 tak puure desh main ek-ek ghar tak bijli pahunchane kaa kaam karenge
 However, since the formation of the government, the power minister of Bangladesh, who has been working on this project till now, claims that he will meet this goal before the year-end elections
 gauratlab he ki vishwa bank pariyojna ke tahat bangladesh main chal rahe is project main teji bharat sarkaar dwaara nebarhud policy ke tahat padosi deshon ko raushan karne kii pahal ke baad dekha gai he
 Due to this initiative of India, the Government of Bangladesh is hopeful that it will meet its targets in half time depending on India
 bangladesh sarkaar ke saamne apane lakshya ko puraa karne main sabase badi dikkat vahaan paidaa ho rahi bijli kii oonchi keemat kii he
 At the same time, the price of electricity produced in India has been steadily decreasing for the past few years
 iske chalate ab bangladesh sarkaar ko modi sarkaar dwaara urja kaarobaar ke jariye dwipaksheeya rishton ko majboot karne kii kavayad raas aa rahi he
 Energy sector experts claim that the Bangladesh government has started claiming that it will meet its target by 2022, based on the strengthening relationship of the energy business with India
 bangladesh sarkaar ke aankadon ke mutabik desh main shaikh hasina ke netritv main 2009 main avami lig kii sarkaar bani thi
 By this time, only 47 percent of consumers in Bangladesh were getting electricity
 lekin shaike hasina sarkaar ke kaarykaal main maujuuda samay main lagbhag 90 fisadi jansankhya tak bijli pahunchane kaa kam puraa kar liya gaya he
 Significantly, the Modi government has set a target of supplying electricity to every household in India till March 2019, due to the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, it is trying to fulfill this promise and go before the public
 ab bangladesh ke saath urja kaarobaar ko majboot kar modi sarkaar march 2019 tak lakshya praapt karne kii safalataa ko chaar chand lagane kii kavayad main he

 supreme court ke teen nyaayadhishon kii peeth dwaara faansee par roak lagane kii uski yachika ko naamanzoor kiye jane or uski curative yachika ko sheersh court main thukraae jane main koi kanoonee khami na paae jane par memon ne raashtrapati pranav mukherjee ke saamne nae sire se dayaa yachika daakhil kii thi
 Mukherjee, taking immediate action on this, first consulted Home Minister Rajnath Singh which later included Home Secretary LC Goel and Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar
 is puri prakriya main do ghanton kaa samay laga
 Earlier in the day, the President sent the petition to the government as per rules
 der raat chif justise ke ghar pahunche the vakilpradhanmantri narendra modi, singh or sheersh adhikariyon ne is vishay par vichaar vimarsh kiya or mukherjee ko memon kii yachika ko naamanzoor karne kaa suzav diya
 Rajnath Singh himself went to Rashtrapati Bhavan to apprise the President of the Government's decision
 samay ke abhaav ko dekhte hue memon ke vakeelon ne nae sire se uski jaan bachaane ke prayaas kiye or faansee par taamil ko rukvane ke liye twarit sunwaayee ke liye yachika ko lekar chif justise ech el dattu ke ghar pahunche
 His lawyers wanted to stop the hanging on the ground that the convict who was sentenced to death needs to be given a chance to challenge the denial of his plea and be given 14 days for other work
 kaaphi vichaar vimarsh ke baad chif justise ne nyaayamurti deepak mishra ke netritv main teen sadasyeey peeth gathit kii thi jisane buudhvaar ko maut ke farmaan ko barkaraar rakhaa tha or faansee par roak lagane se manaa kar diya tha
 The trial commenced at 3
20 in the morning in the court room No
 4 at 4
50 am and with the decision of the bench, Yakub was given the death penalty
 is maamle main aadesh jari karne vaali nyaayamurti deepak mishra ke netritv vaali peeth ne kaha, 'maut ke farmaan par roak nyaay kaa majaak hoga
 The petition is dismissed
 'court ne khaarij kar di apilmeman ke varisht vakil anand grover or yug choudhary ne kaha ki adhikari use dayaa yachika khaarij karne ke raashtrapati ke faisle ko chunauti dene ke adhikaar kaa upyog karne kaa avasar die bina faansee dene par ade hai
 Grover said the convict, who is facing the death penalty, is entitled to 14 days' deferment for various purposes after his mercy petition is dismissed
 memon kii yachika kaa virodh karte hue atorni general mukul rohtagi ne yah daleel di ki uski taaja yachika vyavastha kaa durupyog karne ke samaan he
 Rohatgi said that with the whole effort it seems that his aim is to stay in jail and reduce the punishment
 unhone kaha, teen nyaayadhishon dwaara maatr das ghante pehle maut ke farmaan ko barkaraar rakhane ke faisle ko radd nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Prohibiting death would be a mockery of justice: The SC bench agreed with Rohatgi and while issuing the order, Justice Deepak Mishra said that ample opportunities were given after the President rejected his first mercy petition on April 11, 2014, about which He was informed on 26 May 2014
 unhone kaha ki yachika naamanzoor kiye jane ke baad us samay use ucchtam nyaayalay ke samaksh chunauti di ja sakati thi
 "as a result, if we stay the death decree, it would be a joke with justice," the bench said
 usne saath hi kaha , hamen rit yachika main koi dam najar nahin aata
 Reacting to the order, Grover said it was a tragic mistake and a wrong decision

 The voice of Karmaveer, who runs his life on the basis of different voices, is becoming his identity, people have started coming to him to listen and meet him after a long journey

 But if he has to tell the condition of the match, then he is no less than anyone

 Has Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi), who concluded his rallies with the slogans of Bharat Mata Ki Jai and Vande Mataram, has now abandoned the slogan of Vande Mataram? At least it can be said for rallies in Bihar
 lekin shanivaar ko upi kii raily main bhi piem modi (PM Modi) ne vande maataram kaa naaraa nahin lagaaya
 In such a situation, the question arises whether PM Modi (PM Modi) is doing this after learning the rally with Nitish Kumar in Darbhanga, Bihar
 bataa den ki 25 april ko darbhanga main hui raily ke ant main piem modi (PM Modi) vande maataram kaa naaraa laga rahe the, unka saath manch par baithe tamaam netaa de rahe the lekin nitish kumaar na to apni kursi se uthe or na hi unhone naaraa lagaaya
 After this incident, it was said that Nitish Kumar was feeling uncomfortable in raising the slogan of Vande Mataram from the stage
 bataa den ki nitish kumaar kaa yah video baad main kaaphi viral hua
 Since this incident, PM Modi has held several rallies in UP and Bihar but he did not raise the slogan of Vande Mataram at the conclusion of these rallies

 Significantly, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has taken a strong stand and also attacked CM Nitish Kumar fiercely

 tejasvi yadav ne darbhanga main hue piem modi kii raily kaa ek video share kiya he, jisamen piem modi or sabhi netaa vande maataram kaa naaraa lagaate dikh rahe hai or haath upar kiye hue hai
 But Nitish Kumar is seen sitting quietly on the same stage
 tejasvi yadav ne twitor par likhaa- khaali mere chachaa par vishesh nazar banaae rakhie
 Dear Nitish Kumar Chacha, what is your condition? shaayad ab ghutan nahin hogi kyonki zahreele log saath jo hai

 ’ Cosmetic shopping online is good, discounts are also good, but whether the product that reaches you is real or not is very important
 online cosmetic shopping se pehle kuch baton kaa dhyaan rakhana bahut jaruri he
 For good online shopping, keep these special things in mind: 1
 vishwasaneey site se hi online shopping karenonline cosmetic order karnaa he to vishwasaneey site par hi bharosa karen
 There is also the fear of getting fake goods from any site
 2
 Shop directly from the brand's website, if you want to get a good lipstick, then from a good brand
 ho saktaa he lipstick thodi mahangi ho, lekin ye acchhee hogi or aapke skin ke saath koi risk nahin hoga
 3
 istemaal karne vaale cosmetic hi lenhar brands ek duusare se alag hota he, har brands ke product kaa compojishan alag hota he
 Therefore, order the products of the brand which are already used online
 nae-nae prayog karne se bachein
 4
 sahi shed kaise chunefoundation, kriim yaa lipstick, online cosmetic shopping main sabase badi dikkat shed chunane main aati he
 So the best way to do this is to first go to a shop and choose a shed, then note its brand and shed number and come home and order it online
 isse aapako best daam main acchhee cheez milegi
 5
 agar order sil nahin he to riject kar deshgar cosmetic product sil aapke paas nahin pahunchaa he to use riject kar den

 That marriage is not valid in Sharai
 agar dil se islam kabool kar liya to musalmaan hai, agar dil se nahin sirf jubaan se kah de to duniyaavaalon kii nigaah main musalmaan hai lekin hakeekat main muslim nahin hai
 Those who talk of Love Jihad allege that Muslims change names, tie kalwa under the conspiracy and get money from madrasas
 maine pehle bhi kaha aapse
 The religion in which it is forbidden to see a non-girl with a desire, Madrasa, mosque is obliged to serve the same Islam, so how can we fund against the same Islam
 agar koi muslim yuvak chhadam rup main apane ko peshkar aisa karata he to aap kya kahenge?agar kuch aisa he to vah galat he
 It cannot be said to represent Muslims

 It is not right to talk about some people in society, saying certain elements

 But if some people drink, is it correct to say that Muslims are alcoholics? unhone kaha ki 'mahilaon ne apni degree or skulon main achche grad se kaaryakshetra main apni pahchaan banaai he, jiske kaaran purush samakakshon ne hamen ‘‘gambhirtha’’ se liya

 Karnataka argued that the law system on the water issue is deteriorating, on which the Supreme Court strictly stated that it is the responsibility of the state government to maintain the law system
 iske baad supreme court ne apane paanch sitambar ke aadesh main kuch badlaav kiya
 On September 5, the Supreme Court said that Karnataka should release 15,000 cusecs of Cauvery river daily to Tamil Nadu for the next ten days
 lekin aaj supreme court ne pani kii maatra kam kar di or din badha die
 The court said that Karnataka should now give 12 thousand cusecs of water every day instead of 15 thousand, but instead of 16, this water should be given by 20 dates
 is faisale se karnataka or thaga mahasoos kar rahaa he
 According to the earlier order, he had to give one and a half lakh cusecs of water in ten days, but now he will have to give one lakh 86 thousand cusecs of water
 ab karnataka sarkaar ke saamne is faisale ko lagu karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin he
 On the other hand, it will also have to prepare to deal with the anger of its people
 darasal ye puraa maamla itnaa pechida he ki shaayad hi koi faisalaa aasaani se tamilnadu or karnataka kii janata ke gale utre
 Let's try to understand this controversy first
 desh kii badi nadiyon main se ek kaveri nadi chaar rajyon se hokar bahati he
 Karnataka where it originates, then Tamil Nadu where it flows the longest distance, then Kerala and finally Pondicherry
 iske baad nadi samudr main yani bengal kii khadi main mil jaati he
 There was always a dispute between these states regarding the water of this river
 sabase zyaada karnataka or tamilnadu ke bich
 In order to solve this, the Cauvery River Water Tribunal was formed in 1990
 1991 main tribunel ne ek antarim aword diya
 Under this, Tamil Nadu was given 205 TMC feet of water
 2007 main antim faisalaa aayaa
 It decided to give 419 TMC feet of water to Tamil Nadu in the final award but Karnataka has consistently objected to this and said that it cannot release so much water for Tamil Nadu
 kaveri nadi jal tribunel ke saamne pehali chunauti ye dekhnaa thi ki kaveri main pani he kitna or kahaan-kahaan se aata he
 Experts concluded after long calculations that 740 TMC ft of Cauvery water would be available for use in terms of half dependence on monsoon
 tribunel ke saamne agali chunauti thi is 740 tiemasi feet pani ko chaar rajyon ke bich baantnaa
 Knowing the views of several years of pleas and experts, the tribunal decided to give 419 TMC feet of water to Tamil Nadu, 270 TMC feet of water to Karnataka, 30 TMC feet of water to Kerala and 7 TMC feet of water to Pondicherry
 14 tiemasi feet pani ko paryaavaran ke lihaaz se khaali chhod diya gaya
 After this decision, the tribunal directed Karnataka to ensure that Tamil Nadu gets 192 TMC feet of water annually
 yaheen par sara kanfuzan shuru hua
 Think of it this way
 darasal kaveri nadi main karnataka ke andar ke cachament ilaake main 462 tiemasi feet pani aata he, ye sahaayak nadiyon se bharta he
 Because Karnataka was given 270 TMC of water, the remaining 192 TMC feet would have to be left for Tamil Nadu
 karnataka iske liye taiyaar nahin he
 If Tamil Nadu gets 192 TMC feet from Karnataka, then according to the award, how will 419 TMC feet of water be fulfilled
 ye 227 tiemasi feet pani darasal tamilnadu khud apane cachament aria main janaret karata he
 227 Plus 192 Consists of 419 TMC ft
 is tarah kaveri nadi main karnataka or tamilnadu ke cachament aria se kul milakar 462 or 227 tiemasi feet pani aata he
 When the Cauvery river flows through Kerala, it gets 51 TMC feet of water from the catchment area there, but Kerala is able to use only 30 TMC of it
 bache hue 21 tiemasi pani ko pandicherry (7) or paryaavaran ke lihaaz se (14) rakhaa gaya he
 So the bottom line is that Karnataka puts 462 TMC feet of water in Kaveri and from that it is allowed to use 270 TMC feet of water
 tamilnadu 227 tiemasi feet pani daalata he or 419 tiemasi feet pani paata he
 Kerala pours 51 TMC feet of water but gets only 30 TMC feet of water
 dekhne main lagata he ki karnataka ke saath ye bada anyaay he
 But how did this happen? iskaa jawaab itihaas main he jise dobaaraa nahin likhaa ja saktaa
 It happened that the Chola rulers who ruled Tamil Nadu in the tenth century showed the foresight to build reservoirs and check dams in their state so that river water could be used for irrigation
 duusari ore karnataka main pehla bada jalashay keaar sagar 1934 main bana jab mysore ke shaskaon ne use banwaaya
 In such a situation, the farmers of Tamil Nadu got the initial benefit
 1894 or 1924 ke samjhauton par jab dastakhat hue to tamilnadu ke 15 se 20 lakh acre ilaake balki usase bhi zyaada main sinchai hoti thi
 6 till 1924 in Karnataka
 5 lakh acre main sinchai hoti thi or ab bhi 15 lakh acre main hi kheti hoti he
 This means that Tamil Nadu farmers were using 80% of Cauvery water by 1974
 1974 main karnataka ne 1924 main hue samjhaute ko khaarij kar diya
 So due to this historical advantage and foresight, Tamil Nadu continued to get a large share of Cauvery
 1924 ke samjhaute ke baad tamilnadu kaa jo hissaa pehle 80 fisadi se zyaada tha wo ghatakar 57 fisadi par aa gaya or karnataka kaa hissaa 16 fisadi se badhkar 37 fisadi ho gaya
 The comments to kya ye aword karnataka ke saath anyaay he? haa he
 But more than historical reasons
 kya karnataka bina virodh ke ise sweekaar kar le? nahin, is aword ke kuch pahaluon par spashtataa or badlaav kii zarurat he
 Karnataka had put a special leave petition for this in the Supreme Court in 2007 itself
 tamilnadu or kerala ne bhi aisi hi yachikaayen daaleen kyonki wo bhi aword se khush nahin the
 But they have not been decided yet
 kaveri nadi jal bantwaare ko lekar gussa tabhi saamne aata he jab barish kam hoti he
 There is no tension between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in a good monsoon, but if the rains are less, then from both the political parties to common people in both the states come in front of each other

 kaveri nadi jal bantwaare ko lekar gussa tabhi saamne aata he jab barish kam hoti he
 There is no tension between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in a good monsoon, but if the rains are less, then from both the political parties to common people in both the states come in front of each other
 darasal ye puraa hangaamaa kaveri nadi ke jal bantwaare ko lekar he
 The Supreme Court's decision in this case is being opposed in many areas of Karnataka
 karnataka main ho rahi hinsa kii pratikriya tamilnadu main bhi dikh rahi he
 In Chennai, some people barged into a hotel called New Woodlands on Monday morning and vandalized
 ye hotel karnataka kii ek company kaa he
 It is alleged that the vandalists also threw petrol bombs here and many pamphlets, which said that if people of Tamil Nadu were targeted in Karnataka, it will be avenged
 udhar tamilnadu ke rameswaram main bhi karnataka se aae chaar yatri vaahanon main todphod hui
 These include two buses
 ek driver ke saath bhi marpet kii gai
 In view of all this, Karnataka has stopped its bus services to Tamil Nadu
 is hinsa kaa asar tivi channelon par bhi dikhne laga he
 Tamil language channels have been banned in many places in Karnataka and Kannada language channels have been banned in many cities of Tamil Nadu
 ek ore karnataka or tamilnadu main ye hangaamaa chal rahaa tha udhar dilli main supreme court main id kii chuttee ke din bhi karnataka kii yachika par vishesh sunwaayee chal rahi thi
 Karnataka argued that the law system on the water issue is deteriorating, on which the Supreme Court strictly stated that it is the responsibility of the state government to maintain the law system
 iske baad supreme court ne apane paanch sitambar ke aadesh main kuch badlaav kiya
 On September 5, the Supreme Court said that Karnataka should release 15,000 cusecs of Cauvery river daily to Tamil Nadu for the next ten days
 lekin aaj supreme court ne pani kii maatra kam kar di or din badha die
 The court said that Karnataka should now give 12 thousand cusecs of water every day instead of 15 thousand, but instead of 16, this water should be given by 20 dates
 is faisale se karnataka or thaga mahasoos kar rahaa he
 According to the earlier order, he had to give one and a half lakh cusecs of water in ten days, but now he will have to give one lakh 86 thousand cusecs of water
 ab karnataka sarkaar ke saamne is faisale ko lagu karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin he
 On the other hand, it will also have to prepare to deal with the anger of its people
 darasal ye puraa maamla itnaa pechida he ki shaayad hi koi faisalaa aasaani se tamilnadu or karnataka kii janata ke gale utre
 Let's try to understand this controversy first
 desh kii badi nadiyon main se ek kaveri nadi chaar rajyon se hokar bahati he
 Karnataka where it originates, then Tamil Nadu where it flows the longest distance, then Kerala and finally Pondicherry
 iske baad nadi samudr main yani bengal kii khadi main mil jaati he
 There was always a dispute between these states regarding the water of this river
 sabase zyaada karnataka or tamilnadu ke bich
 In order to solve this, the Cauvery River Water Tribunal was formed in 1990
 1991 main tribunel ne ek antarim aword diya
 Under this, Tamil Nadu was given 205 TMC feet of water
 2007 main antim faisalaa aayaa
 It decided to give 419 TMC feet of water to Tamil Nadu in the final award but Karnataka has consistently objected to this and said that it cannot release so much water for Tamil Nadu
 kaveri nadi jal tribunel ke saamne pehali chunauti ye dekhnaa thi ki kaveri main pani he kitna or kahaan-kahaan se aata he
 Experts concluded after long calculations that 740 TMC ft of Cauvery water would be available for use in terms of half dependence on monsoon
 tribunel ke saamne agali chunauti thi is 740 tiemasi feet pani ko chaar rajyon ke bich baantnaa
 Knowing the views of several years of pleas and experts, the tribunal decided to give 419 TMC feet of water to Tamil Nadu, 270 TMC feet of water to Karnataka, 30 TMC feet of water to Kerala and 7 TMC feet of water to Pondicherry
 14 tiemasi feet pani ko paryaavaran ke lihaaz se khaali chhod diya gaya
 After this decision, the tribunal directed Karnataka to ensure that Tamil Nadu gets 192 TMC feet of water annually
 yaheen par sara kanfuzan shuru hua
 Think of it this way
 darasal kaveri nadi main karnataka ke andar ke cachament ilaake main 462 tiemasi feet pani aata he, ye sahaayak nadiyon se bharta he
 Because Karnataka was given 270 TMC of water, the remaining 192 TMC feet would have to be left for Tamil Nadu
 karnataka iske liye taiyaar nahin he
 If Tamil Nadu gets 192 TMC feet from Karnataka, then according to the award, how will 419 TMC feet of water be fulfilled
 ye 227 tiemasi feet pani darasal tamilnadu khud apane cachament aria main janaret karata he
 227 Plus 192 Consists of 419 TMC ft
 is tarah kaveri nadi main karnataka or tamilnadu ke cachament aria se kul milakar 462 or 227 tiemasi feet pani aata he
 When the Cauvery river flows through Kerala, it gets 51 TMC feet of water from the catchment area there, but Kerala is able to use only 30 TMC of it
 bache hue 21 tiemasi pani ko pandicherry (7) or paryaavaran ke lihaaz se (14) rakhaa gaya he
 So the bottom line is that Karnataka puts 462 TMC feet of water in Kaveri and from that it is allowed to use 270 TMC feet of water
 tamilnadu 227 tiemasi feet pani daalata he or 419 tiemasi feet pani paata he
 Kerala pours 51 TMC feet of water but gets only 30 TMC feet of water
 dekhne main lagata he ki karnataka ke saath ye bada anyaay he
 But how did this happen? iskaa jawaab itihaas main he jise dobaaraa nahin likhaa ja saktaa
 It happened that the Chola rulers who ruled Tamil Nadu in the tenth century showed the foresight to build reservoirs and check dams in their state so that river water could be used for irrigation
 duusari ore karnataka main pehla bada jalashay keaar sagar 1934 main bana jab mysore ke shaskaon ne use banwaaya
 In such a situation, the farmers of Tamil Nadu got the initial benefit
 1894 or 1924 ke samjhauton par jab dastakhat hue to tamilnadu ke 15 se 20 lakh acre ilaake balki usase bhi zyaada main sinchai hoti thi
 6 till 1924 in Karnataka
 5 lakh acre main sinchai hoti thi or ab bhi 15 lakh acre main hi kheti hoti he
 This means that Tamil Nadu farmers were using 80% of Cauvery water by 1974
 1974 main karnataka ne 1924 main hue samjhaute ko khaarij kar diya
 So due to this historical advantage and foresight, Tamil Nadu continued to get a large share of Cauvery
 1924 ke samjhaute ke baad tamilnadu kaa jo hissaa pehle 80 fisadi se zyaada tha wo ghatakar 57 fisadi par aa gaya or karnataka kaa hissaa 16 fisadi se badhkar 37 fisadi ho gaya

 darasal kaveri nadi main karnataka ke andar ke cachament ilaake main 462 tiemasi feet pani aata he, ye sahaayak nadiyon se bharta he
 Because Karnataka was given 270 TMC of water, the remaining 192 TMC feet would have to be left for Tamil Nadu
 karnataka iske liye taiyaar nahin he
 If Tamil Nadu gets 192 TMC feet from Karnataka, then according to the award, how will 419 TMC feet of water be fulfilled
 ye 227 tiemasi feet pani darasal tamilnadu khud apane cachament aria main janaret karata he
 227 Plus 192 Consists of 419 TMC ft
 is tarah kaveri nadi main karnataka or tamilnadu ke cachament aria se kul milakar 462 or 227 tiemasi feet pani aata he
 When the Cauvery river flows through Kerala, it gets 51 TMC feet of water from the catchment area there, but Kerala is able to use only 30 TMC of it
 bache hue 21 tiemasi pani ko pandicherry (7) or paryaavaran ke lihaaz se (14) rakhaa gaya he
 So the bottom line is that Karnataka puts 462 TMC feet of water in Kaveri and from that it is allowed to use 270 TMC feet of water
 tamilnadu 227 tiemasi feet pani daalata he or 419 tiemasi feet pani paata he
 Kerala pours 51 TMC feet of water but gets only 30 TMC feet of water
 dekhne main lagata he ki karnataka ke saath ye bada anyaay he
 But how did this happen? iskaa jawaab itihaas main he jise dobaaraa nahin likhaa ja saktaa
 It happened that the Chola rulers who ruled Tamil Nadu in the tenth century showed the foresight to build reservoirs and check dams in their state so that river water could be used for irrigation
 duusari ore karnataka main pehla bada jalashay keaar sagar 1934 main bana jab mysore ke shaskaon ne use banwaaya
 In such a situation, the farmers of Tamil Nadu got the initial benefit
 1894 or 1924 ke samjhauton par jab dastakhat hue to tamilnadu ke 15 se 20 lakh acre ilaake balki usase bhi zyaada main sinchai hoti thi
 6 till 1924 in Karnataka
 5 lakh acre main sinchai hoti thi or ab bhi 15 lakh acre main hi kheti hoti he
 This means that Tamil Nadu farmers were using 80% of Cauvery water by 1974
 1974 main karnataka ne 1924 main hue samjhaute ko khaarij kar diya
 So due to this historical advantage and foresight, Tamil Nadu continued to get a large share of Cauvery
 1924 ke samjhaute ke baad tamilnadu kaa jo hissaa pehle 80 fisadi se zyaada tha wo ghatakar 57 fisadi par aa gaya or karnataka kaa hissaa 16 fisadi se badhkar 37 fisadi ho gaya
 The comments to kya ye aword karnataka ke saath anyaay he? haa he
 But more than historical reasons
 kya karnataka bina virodh ke ise sweekaar kar le? nahin, is aword ke kuch pahaluon par spashtataa or badlaav kii zarurat he
 Karnataka had put a special leave petition for this in the Supreme Court in 2007 itself
 tamilnadu or kerala ne bhi aisi hi yachikaayen daaleen kyonki wo bhi aword se khush nahin the
 But they have not been decided yet
 kaveri nadi jal bantwaare ko lekar gussa tabhi saamne aata he jab barish kam hoti he
 There is no tension between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in a good monsoon, but if the rains are less, then from both the political parties to common people in both the states come in front of each other
 is nadi ke pani ko lekar in rajyon ke bich hameshaa vivaad rahaa
 Maximum between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 isi ko hal karne ke liye 1990 main kaveri nadi jal tribunel banaaya gaya
 In 1991, the tribunal gave an interim award
 iske tahat tamilnadu ko 205 tiemasi feet pani diya gaya
 The final decision came in 2007
 isamen tamilnadu ko final aword main 419 tiemasi feet pani dene kaa faisalaa kiya gaya lekin karnataka ne is par lagaataar etraz kiya he or kaha he ki wo tamilnadu ke liye itnaa pani nahin chhod saktaa
 The first challenge before the Cauvery River Water Tribunal was to see how much and where the water in Cauvery comes from
 jaankaron ne lambii gananaaon ke baad ye nishkarsh nikaala ki monsoon par aadhi nirbharta ke lihaaz se kaveri kaa 740 tiemasi feet pani istemaal ke liye uplabdh hoga
 The next challenge before the tribunal was to divide the 740 TMC feet of water between the four states
 kai saal kii daleelon or visheshgyon ke vichaaron ko jaanane ke baad tribunel ne 419 tiemasi feet pani tamilnadu ko dene kaa faisalaa kiya, 270 tiemasi feet pani karnataka ko, 30 tiemasi feet pani kerala ko or 7 tiemasi feet pani pondicheri ko dene kaa faisalaa kiya
 14 TMC feet of water was left empty for the environment
 is faisale ke baad tribunel ne karnataka ko nirdesh diya ki wo ye sunishchit kare ki 192 tiemasi feet pani salanaa tamilnadu ko mili
 This is where all the confusions started
 isi is tarah samajhen
 In fact, the catchment area inside Karnataka in Kaveri river brings 462 TMC feet of water, it fills with tributaries
 kyonki karnataka ko 270 tiemasi pani hi diya gaya to baaki bachaa 192 tiemasi feet use tamilnadu ke liye chhodana hoga
 Karnataka is not ready for this
 tamilnadu ko agar ye 192 tiemasi feet karnataka se miltaa he to aword ke mutabik 419 tiemasi feet pani puraa kaise hoga
 This 227 TMC ft water actually generates Tamil Nadu in its catchment area
 227 plus 192 milakar hota he 419 tiemasi feet
 In this way, the Cauvery river receives 462 and 227 TMC feet of water from catchment areas in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 kaveri nadi jab kerala se hokar bahati he to vahaan ke cachament aria se usamen 51 tiemasi feet pani aata he lekin kerala isamen se 30 tiemasi hi istemaal kar paata he
 The remaining 21 TMC of water is retained in Pondicherry (7) and environmentally (14)
 to labboluab ye he ki karnataka 462 tiemasi feet pani kaveri main daalata he or usamen se use 270 tiemasi feet pani istemaal karne kii ijazat he
 Tamil Nadu pours 227 TMC feet of water and receives 419 TMC feet of water
 kerala 51 tiemasi feet pani daalata he lekin use 30 tiemasi feet pani hi istemaal karne ko miltaa he
 It seems that this is a big injustice to Karnataka
 lekin ye hua kaise
 The answer lies in history, which cannot be rewritten
 hua ye ki chol shaskaon ne jo dasvin shatabdi main tamilnadu par raaj karte the, unhone ye doordarshita dikhaai ki apane rajya main jalashay or checkdam banawaye taaki nadi ke pani ko sinchai ke liye istemaal kiya ja sake
 On the other hand KR Sagar, the first major reservoir in Karnataka was built in 1934 when the rulers of Mysore built it
 aise main tamilnadu ke kisaanon ko shuruaati phayda mila
 When the agreements of 1894 and 1924 were signed, Tamil Nadu used to irrigate 1
5 to 2 million acres, but even more
 karnataka main 1924 tak 6
 There was irrigation in 5 lakh acres and still farming is done in 15 lakh acres
 iskaa matlab ye he ki 1974 tak kaveri ke pani kaa 80% tamilnadu ke kisaan istemaal kar rahe the
 In 1974, Karnataka rejected the 1924 agreement
 to is aitihaasik faayde or doordarshita kii vajah se tamilnadu ko kaveri kaa bada hissaa miltaa rahaa
 After the 1924 agreement, the share of Tamil Nadu which was earlier more than 80 percent came down to 57 percent and the share of Karnataka increased from 16 percent to 37 percent
 tippaniyan So is this award an injustice to Karnataka? Yes
 lekin aitihaasik vajahon se zyaada
 Should Karnataka accept it without protest? No, some aspects of this award require clarity and change
 karnataka ne iske liye 2007 main hi supreme court main ek special live pitishan daal di thi
 Tamil Nadu and Kerala also filed similar petitions as they too were not happy with the award
 lekin abhi tak in par faisalaa nahin hua he
 Anger over the sharing of the Cauvery river water comes out only when the rains are less
 achche monsoon main karnataka or tamilnadu ke bich koi tanaav nahin dikhataa lekin agar barish kam hui to donon hi rajyon main raajnneetik dalon se lekar aam log tak ek duusare ke saamne aa jate hai

 iskaa matlab ye he ki 1974 tak kaveri ke pani kaa 80% tamilnadu ke kisaan istemaal kar rahe the
 In 1974, Karnataka rejected the 1924 agreement
 to is aitihaasik faayde or doordarshita kii vajah se tamilnadu ko kaveri kaa bada hissaa miltaa rahaa
 After the 1924 agreement, the share of Tamil Nadu which was earlier more than 80 percent came down to 57 percent and the share of Karnataka increased from 16 percent to 37 percent
 tippaniyan So is this award an injustice to Karnataka? Yes
 lekin aitihaasik vajahon se zyaada
 Should Karnataka accept it without protest? No, some aspects of this award require clarity and change
 karnataka ne iske liye 2007 main hi supreme court main ek special live pitishan daal di thi
 Tamil Nadu and Kerala also filed similar petitions as they too were not happy with the award
 lekin abhi tak in par faisalaa nahin hua he
 Anger over the sharing of the Cauvery river water comes out only when the rains are less

 thailand kii gupha main kaaphi mashkkat ke baad 6 bacchon ko baahar nikaal liya gaya he
 The children are taken out with the help of divers outside
 lekin yah kaam behad kathin rahaa
 Other measures are also being taken to evacuate the children from the cave
 inamen se ek he baby sabamarine
 Elon Musk, one of America's richest people and CEO of spacex and Tesla, has come forward to help children
 musk ne kaha he ki unki company ek choti pandubbi bana rahi he jo is gupha main andar ja sakegi
 The special thing will be that it will be made from rocket parts
 haalanki abhi jis tarah se rescue oparation chal rahaa he, usase ummid jataai ja rahi ki is sabamarine ke bagaiyr hi bacchon ko surakshit nikaal liya jayega
 But still the baby submarine is also being prepared in view of any situation
 isaki jaankaree alan musk ne apane aadhikarik twitor handle ke jariye di he
 Musk said in a tweet, 'after getting a better response from Thailand, we are working to build a child-sized submarine
 ye pandubbi falcon rocket ke liquid oxijan transfar tub ke jariye sanchalit hogi
 This submarine will be very light in weight and 2 divers will be able to carry it
 ye kaaphi majboot bhi hogi or ise gupha ke sankare raaston se aasaani se nikaala ja sakegaa
 'some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand
 Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try
 Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks
 Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does
 - Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2018 In many more tweets, Musk has informed that this submarine will have 8 hitch points, including 4 forwards and 4 at the back
 saath hi licage se bachaane ke liye 4 air tanks bhi jude honge
 Also, while answering some questions, Musk on Twitter informed that this submarine will be ready in about 8 hours and it will take 17 hours to reach Thailand by flight
 gupha main kaise pahunche bachche23 june ko wild bors naam kii team ne footbal match khelaa
 The children wanted to have fun as usual
 cycle res lagaate hue team gupha tak ja pahunchi
 He was also the 13th boy in the race
 lekin kisi kaarnon se usko waapas janaa padaa
 They were entering through different paths
 dekhte-dekhte itani barish hui ki gupha main baadh aa gai
 There was only one way out and it was completely closed
 raat tak jab bachche ghar nahin laute to gharavaale pareshaan ho gaye
 The administration was informed about this
 prashasan khoj main lag gaya
 Thailand's Navy SEAL was deployed in this operation
 australia, england, china samet 8 desh bachaav main lage
 Eventually the rescue team reached close to the children, but they were still 4 km from the entrance
 ek prashikshit tairaak ko vahaan par pahunchane main 6 ghante lag rahe hai or nikalne main 5 ghante
 People felt that the relief workers would bring the children, but there are many places inside the cave where swimming is required, in which case only a trained swimmer can swim
 barish main hameshaa in gufaaon main pani bhar jaataa he or sitambar ke maheene tak hi utarataa he
 The children did not eat for 9 days, only they were alive with the help of flood water
 bacchon ko ye tak nahin pataa tha ki ve kitne din se fanse hue hai
 There is a cave under the mountains
 kuch raste upar jate hai or kuch neeche
 There is water in every connecting link
 bacchon ko na tairnaa or na hi ghota lagaana aata he
 Children are being taught swimming and diving
 gupha ke andar doctoron kaa ek dal pahunch chukaa he
 The diver has delivered the food
 bacchon ke liye 4 maheene ke khaane kaa intjaam kar diya gaya he
 a phone call was also sent for a conversation, but that too deteriorated due to wet
 pani nikaalane ke liye pump laga hua he
 The water level of the cave has decreased by 16 cm
 lekin pahaad se riskar pani dobaaraa bhar ja rahaa he
 There is a fear that if there is heavy rain again, the place where the children have taken shelter may sink and there is a warning of heavy rain for the next few days
 rashtriya janata dal (argedy) pramukh lalu prasad yadav ne somvaar ko rashtriya ekta parishad kii baithak ke baad narendra modi or laal krishna adwani par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that Modi will never become the Prime Minister of the country, so he is fulfilling his intention from the fake Red Fort itself
 unhone adwani par babari masjid ko lekar vaada khilaaphi kaa aarope lagaaya
 According to Lalu, Advani had assured the then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao that there would be no damage to the disputed structure but the demolition took place there
 rashtriya ekta parishad kii somvaar ko hui baithak main narendra modi kii gaiyrhaajari par chutki lete hue unhone kaha ki modi ko pataa tha ki aaj unki jamkar khinchaai hogi isliye ve nahin aae
 Apart from this, he feared that the upcoming elections could be dangerous for the country
 kyonki sampradayik takatein dhruvikaran karne ke liye dangon kaa sahaara le sakati he
 In such a situation, it is necessary for secular parties to come together
 lalu prasad ne kaha, '2014 kaa chunaav behad khatarnaak he
 Fascist and communal forces want to seize Delhi by breaking the unity and integrity of the country
 isliye bade paimaane par dange karaae jaaenge taaki samaaj kaa sampradayik dhruvikaran ho
 Amit Shah, the general manager of the Gujarat riots, reached UP first, being in charge
 phir mujffarnagar main hinsa hui
 Now he is also coming to Patna
 'unhone kaha, 'main to kahata hum ki mujffarnagar main jo halaat paidaa hue, yah to shuruyaat he
 Just before the elections, the festive season will spoil the atmosphere
 bihar main navada, betia or kai jagahon par hinsa bhadakaane kaa kaam kiya gaya he or nitish sarkaar haath par haath dhare baithi rahi
 Secular forces have to come together to counter communal forces in the 2014 riots
 taaki virodhiyon ke napak iraadon ko chakanachur kiya ja sake
 Taking a dig at Advani, he said, "there was a meeting of the National Integration Council just before the Babri Masjid demolition
" tatkaaleen pradhanmantri narsinha raav ko adwani ne bharosa dilaayaa tha ki masjid ko koi nuksaan nahin hoga
 But those people turned around
 'modi ke piem banane ke sapane par unhone kaha, 'wo piem pratyaashee hi hai, piem nahin banenge
 He gave a speech from the fake Red Fort in Chhattisgarh
 laal kila pahunchnaa itnaa aasaan he kya
 
 
 So Modi fulfilled his dream right there
 ' The ruling Janata Dal United (JDU) of Bihar does not seem to remain united for long

 darasal bihar main argedy ke saath mahagathbandhan todakar bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane ke nitish kumaar ke faisle se sharad yadav naaraaz hai
 Describing it as an insult to the mandate, he reached Patna for a three-day tour in Bihar in the name of public interest campaign

 jis 11 karod janata se hamane jo qaraar kiya tha, wo imaan kaa qaraar tha
 He is broken, which has hurt us
 ' sharad yadav ne saath hi kaha ki 70 saal ke itihaas main aisa koi udhaaharan nahin miltaa, jahaan do party yaa gathbandhan jo chunaav main aamane-saamne lade hon or jinke menifesto alag-alag hon, donon ke menifesto mil gaye hon
 He said that this is a crisis of confidence in democracy
 sharad yadavake in bagawati tewaron ke baad unki party jediu ne unase saaf shabdon main kaha he ki sharad yadav ko jo kuch bhi kahana he vah party netaaon ke saamne kahen
 At the same time, the party's executive meeting is to be held in Patna on August 19, in which he can also put his side
 jediu mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ne ajtak se is babat baatcheet main kaha ki sharad yadav ko 19 taarikh tak sanyam baratna chahie or maryaada main rahanaa chahie
 Tyagi also alleged a nexus between Sharad Yadav and Lalu Prasad Yadav
 unhone kaha ki sharad yadav jis raah par chale hai, us andheri raah main unhenlaalaten kaa saathhai
 Earlier, there was news that the party might show the way out to Otaru Sharad Yadav on the rebellion
 haalanki tyaagi se isse inkaar karte hue kaha ki party ne abhi sharad yadav par koi karrwai karne kaa man nahin banaaya he or naa hi party main koi vibhaajan hone ja rahaa he
 Though he said with this, but we have definitely told Sharad Yadav that the yatra in Bihar and the special meeting called by him in Delhi were canceled
 vahiin duusari orsharad khemakisi bhi tarah digne ko taiyaar nahin dikhataa
 When asked by JDU MP Ali Anwar, who is believed to be in the Sharad camp, that the party is planning to take action against him and Sharad Yadav, he said that the country is above the party and any sacrifice can be made for the country is
 aapako bataa den ki jediu ke purv adhyaksh guuruuvaar se bihar kii teen divasiy yatra shuru karne ja rahe hai
 Sharad Yadav also told that he has called a meeting of like-minded leaders on 17 August in Delhi

 BJP is also going to make this mantra the base of the 2019 election battle
 aakhir kya he iske myne? aakhir kaise puraa karenge ise siem yogi?1
 Time-less challenges: The road ahead is going to be more difficult for the BJP, which has won its glory in the election war of Hazarup

 How will UP become the engine of development for the country? After the new government took over power in UP, PM Modi presented the roadmap for the state government
 piem ne kaha- vikaas hamaara moolmantra or makasad he or uttar pradesh ke vikaas se desh kaa vikaas hoga
 Now Yogi Sarkar has to perform
 uttar pradesh kii aabaadi 22 karod he yani desh kii aabaadi kii 16 fisadi, lekin jidipi main hissaa sirf 12 fisadi he
 UP ranks 31st in per capita income
 upi main 30 fisadi garib hai, jabaki rashtriya str par ye aankada 22 fisadi he
 According to experts, if there is development in UP, the country's growth rate will increase by one percent

 Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said in Lok Sabha on Friday that the new BJP government in Uttar Pradesh will forgive the debts of the farmers of the state and the central government will bear the burden of loan waiver
 chunauti yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 If the government takes this decision in UP, then demand will rise in other states as well
 baaki dal is maang ko jor-shor se uthaaenge or 2019 ke chunaav main ye mudda bada ban saktaa he
 On the other hand, SBI chiefs seem to question the farmers' decision on loan waiver

 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle bihar kii siyaasi tasviir pal-pal badalati ja rahi he
 The sixth installment of 'bihar Diary before Election' is exploring the theory behind such political equations
 
 
 1
 In Darbhanga, there is a direct fight between bjp's Kirti Azad and rjd's Ali Ashraf Fatmi
 darbhanga main brahman or musalmaan baraabar hai or jitne yadav hai utane hi baniyaa matadaata
 The Muslim vote is close to 25 percent here
 ladaai kaante kii he, lekin darbhanga kaa chunaav pichley kai baar se dhruvikaran kii taraf agrasar hua he jiske liye haal kii kuch ghatnaayen bhi jimmevaar hai
 In Darbhanga's election, the rjd's base vote is also divided
 haal ke saalon main darbhanga bijepi ke garh ke rup main ubhara he or shahanvaaj hossain bhi yahaan se ladane ke icchhuk bataae jate hai
 However, his chances are slim, as bjp's sitting MP from here
 aise main jedy-you ke bade diggaj bhi yahaan se chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate
 The fight is clearly between the BJP-RJD and the BJP seems to have a heavy upper hand
 '2
 'hukumdev Narayan Yadav, the current BJP MP from Madhubani, will be the candidate, which is his age
 congress se shakeel ahamed phir se lard sakate hai
 After the alliance with RJD, the expectation has strengthened
 pichley chunaav main lalu ne aakhri ghadi main madhubani se abdul baari siddiqui ko maidan main utarkar shakeel or congress ko unki sahi jagah bataa di thi! idhar jedy-you se lalit narayan mishra ke suputr or jaale ke vidhayak vijay mishra koshish kar rahe hai
 Mishra is a rebel MLA of BJP and wants to take advantage in this triangular fight
 madhubani seat par musalmaan, yadav or brahman lagbhag baraabar sankhya main he or uske baad mandal or paswan he
 If the JD-U fielded Brahmin candidates, the Congress can stay in the fight here
 '3
 The last time jd-u's Manganilal Mandal won from Jhanjharpur, the party suspended, now Lalu is likely to fight the party
 jedy-you se philhal nitish ke kareebi sanjay jha taal thok rahe hai jabaki bijepi se do ummidavaaron kii daavedaari he
 Benipatti MLA Vinod Narayan Jha and Legislative Councilor Balesar Singh Bharti
 bijepi san 1991 ke baad pehali baar yahaan se chunaav ladegi
 After delimitation, Koiari voters in Jhanjharpur have grown in size and Balesar Bharti's claim is due to this, as they are old Sanghis
 jhanjharpur main yadav or brahman baraabar sankhya main hai uske baad musalmaan, kyot-dhanak or dalit samooh hai
 The Yadavas have a history here since the Mandal era
 manganilaal mandal(dhanuk) iklaute apwaad hai
 The Vaishya group and Koiri's population have grown since the delimitation — and the bjp's confidence is on the rise
 aise main ladaai rajd or bijepi main hogi, kyonki thok vot rajd yaa bijepi ke paas hi he

 This is the last event of Venus's unique transmission in this century
 vaigyanikon or shaukia khagol vigyaniyon main shukr ke pargaman ko lekar behad utsaah dekha gaya
 In this incident, a deep black spot appeared on the surface of the Sun
 yah najaara deshbhar main dikhaa
 However, due to the cloudy sky, there was a hindrance in Delhi and some other parts of North India
 nehru taramandal kii nideshak en ratnashri ne bataaya, ‘is sadi main shukr kaa yah antim pargaman he
 'he told that the scene was seen around seven in the morning
 logon ko is khagoleey najaare ko dikhaane ke liye taramandal main bade-bade projector, camere or doorabeen lagaai gai thim jahaan badi sankhya main log jute

 ’ vah is tarah kaa najaara 2004 main bhi dekh chuki hai
 CB Devgan, director of the Science Popularization Association of Communicators and Educators (space), said, 'the next transit of Venus will now be 105 years to 2117 after five months
 ’ devgan ne kaha ki yah ghatana tab hoti he jab shukr grah surya or dharti ke bich se gujarata he
 Only two planets, Mercury and Venus, can be seen transiting the Sun from the Earth
 1609 main doorabeen ke avishkaar ke baad se ab tak shukr ke 7 pargaman ho chuke hai
 These transits are repeated once in 243 years
 jisamen 8 varsh ke antaraal se do pargaman disambar main hote hai
 Then 121
 5 varsh baad 8 varsh ke antaraal se do pargaman june ke maheene main hote hai
 There was no transit of Venus in the 20th century
 1874 tathaa 1882 ke jode ke baad pehla pargaman 8 june 2004 ko hua
 And the couple's second transit is taking place on 6 June 2012
 yani agar aap 6 june kaa venus transit nahin dekh pate hai to aapako 105 saal or intjaar karnaa hoga yani aap phir kabhi venus transit nahin dekh paaenge

 Not only this, if you have solar eclipse goggle, which is a special spectacle to see solar eclipse, then also you can see the union of sun and Venus

 At that time, experiments were done one by one to see it from all over the world
