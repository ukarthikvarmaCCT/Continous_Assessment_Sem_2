 Late evening of January 5, 5-year-old Tannu was playing with the children of his neighborhood
 tabhi paas ke hi yuvak ne bahala phusalaakar 3 bacchon klyparankar liya

 The practice of polyandry has long been erased from the mainstream culture of our country
 yani ecopurush ke liye kai striyon ke saath sansargaka saamaajik rup se nishedh ho gaya
 In that sense, this news can be called dangerous and provocative
 magar masalasehat or researchka he, isliye is tarah kii bandishen lagaana thik nahin
 The news is that according to new research, if a man has a physical relationship with many women, then his chances of suffering from prostate cancer are reduced significantly
 kitni kam ho jaati he
 Three times less than normal
 research main pataa chalaa ki jo purush 20 yaa usase zyada mahilaon ke saath shaareerik sambandh bana chuke hai
 The risk of prostate cancer in them has decreased by 28 percent
 sehat kaa yah bonus yaheen nahin rukta
 The risk of having the most dangerous type of tumor in men who have multiple relationships is also 19 percent less
 research kahati he ki agar aap brahmacharya kaa paalan karte hai, to in bimariyon se grast hone kii ashanka saamaanya se bhi zyada ho jaati he
 Earlier, it was also revealed in a research that if you remain active in sexual intercourse, the cancer causing chemicals are released with semen
 aisa isliye hota he kyonki prostate veery ke saath kai or kism ke dravya bhi sharir se baahar nikaal detii he
 However, it has to be noted that this study talks about being active in physical relationships
 lekin naveenatam research yon sakriyata yaa hastmaithun ke bajaay saathiyon kii sankhya kii adhikta kii baat karti he
 And since such research and then spontaneous findings generated from it can have a dangerous effect on society
 aise main professor sahib se yah sawaal poocha janaa lajimi tha
 And the question was answered by Professor Mary Elise parent, it is too early to reach any such conclusion
 unke mutabik yah mumkin he ki kai mahilaon ke saath yon sambandh banane se purush tulanaatmak rup se zyada uttejit or sakriy rahete hon
 As a result, their semen secretion is high
 or aise main prostate cancer ke liye jimmedaar hanikaarak rasayanon kii nikasi bhi zyada hoti he
 Another research in this regard is significant
 iske mutabik agar aap sex sambandhon ke maamle main udasin nahin rahete hai, to aapke prostate ke ird gird calcium kii hanikaarak bhitti banane kii ashanka kam rahati he
 The prostate gland is located between the bladder and penis and just in front of the beginning of the anal passage

 france ke raashtrapati emanuel maikron ne aaj baton hi baton main america raashtrapati donald trump kii chutki le lee
 While Macron withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord, he taunted Trump on the anonymity, while praising PM Narendra Modi
 maikron aaj yahaan antarrashtriya saura gathbandhan kii sthapana par yojit sammelan ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 When Macron was praising a group of female solar engineers 'solar', he also mentioned the countries leaving the Paris Climate Agreement
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii upasthiti menmacrone kaha ki pradhanmantri ji, aapane ek sapana dekha tha or hamane ise kar dikhaaya
 It was about this international solar alliance
 do saal pehle, yah maatr ek vichaar tha or ham sabane is par teji se kaam karne kaa nirnay kiya or aaj yah ek bada parivartan he
 Expressing happiness over the efforts of 'solar Mothers', she appreciated them
 unhone kaha ki hamaari saura maanon ne hamaara intjaar bhi nahin kiya
 He started working and gave complete results as well
 unhone pratiksha nahin kii or naa hi ve sirf isliye rukeen ki kuch deshon (america evam anya) ne maidan chhodane or paris samjhaute se hatane kaa nirnay kiya he
 Because, they (ISA member countries) decided that it was good for their children and grandchildren
 unhone is par kaam karne kaa or karte rahane kaa nirnay kiya
 His gesture was for US President Trump to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord
 is samjhaute par disambar 2015 main kareeb 200 deshon ne hastakshar kiye hai
 Its goal is to reduce emissions of gases that pollute the environment, and to keep global temperatures in the range of two degrees Celsius
 pichley saal november main syria ne bhi is par hastakshar kar die or ab duniya main keval america aisa desh bachaa he jo is samjhaute kaa hissaa nahin he
 The special thing is that France is also a co-host country of the isa's Establishment Conference

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Startup India program could get a boost in the upcoming budget

 ' upi fatah ke baad bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne dilli main emsidi chunaav ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar di hai
 In view of the corporation elections, Amit Shah addressed the party workers at the Ramlila Maidan, who have been given booth level responsibility
 panchaparmeshwaranam se yojit is sammelan main bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki bijepi ke kaaryakarta dilli sarkaar ke ghotaale bataaenge
 Along with this, he said that the victory of bjp's victory in the MCD election will be won
 iske saath hiamit shahne kaha ki dilli main jitna bhrashtachar AAP party ne itane kam samay main kiya he, utana bhrashtachar kisi sarkaar ne nahin kiya
 He said, when the election season comes, Kejriwal ji promises a promise, but after that Delhi people find him
 ' unhone aarope lagaaya ki aam aadmi party ne dilli kii mahilaon ke liye teen pej ke vaade kiye the, uname se kuch nahin kiya
 During this, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari also addressed the party workers
 unhone yahaan kaaryakartaaon ko josh bharte hue kaha, ham us party ke sipaahi hai, jiske pradhanmantri ne diwali dilli main nahin balki barf main desh kii seva karne vaale sainikon ke saath manaai
 Please tell that Delhi BJP had invited more than 65 thousand workers to this conference
 darasal upi main aitihaasik jeet ke baad party ke hausale buland hai, lekin dilli main jameen kitni majboot he, isko lekar party koi jokhim nahin lenaa chaahati he
 The major reason for this is the bjp's crushing defeat in the Delhi Assembly elections
 is baar arvind kejariwal kii party AAP bhi emsidi chunaav main utar rahi he
 Given the aap's record performance in the Delhi Assembly, the mcd's ruling BJP may face difficulties this time
 aise main bijepi ne sanghathan str par micro management par focus kiya he
 Under this, the party has formed a team of five workers at every booth for more than 13 thousand booths fixed for MCD elections
 team ke sadsy booth ke tahat aane vaale matadaataaon se na sirf sampark karenge, balki ground report bhi party ko denge
 So that on the basis of this report, the party can formulate its strategy in the election and change it if required

 vishwa main 29 oktober ko vishwasorisisdivas ke rup main manaya jaataa he
 This year's global theme emphasizes the importance of symptoms of psoriasis
 duniyabar main psorisis rog se teen fisadi aabaadi yani kareeb 12
 500 million people are affected
 rog pratirohak pranali kii gadabadi se psorisis rog hota he
 It has nothing to do with the type of cosmetic or dermatitis, although many other diseases and problems associated with it may occur after this disease occurs
 psorisis ko aksar skin infections yaa cosmeticproblemamana jaataa he, jiskaa aasaani se ilaaj ho saktaa he
 But psoriasis is the opposite
 darasal, psorisis rog tabhi hota he jab rog pratirohak tantra swasth koshikaon par hamalaa karata he
 This causes many skin cells to grow, causing dry and hard rashes on the skin, as skin cells form on the surface of the skin
 psorisis ke lakshan-health export ne kaha, 'twachaa par hone vaale anya rogon se alag psorisis naam kaa rog ati sakriy pratirohak pranali se hota he, jisamen sharir kii pratirohak pranali hi swasth koshikaon or utakon par hamalaa karti he
 Common symptoms of psoriasis include itching in the affected normal organs of the body
 twachaa par papadi jaisi upree parat jam jaati he
 Red spots and rashes occur in the body
 psorisis kaa koi sampurna ilaaj nahin he, lekin soirosis ke lakshanon kii gambhirtha ke baavjood ise kaaphi had tak control kiya yaa ja saktaa he
 'another health expert says that we do not take the symptoms of psoriasis seriously in our society
 beemaari ko nazarandaaj karne or psorisis rog ke sambandh main jaagrurakta kii kami se samay par rog kaa pataa nahin chal paata or is beemaari ke ilaaj main kaaphi rukaawat aati he
 There is a cure for other diseases on the skin and body, but there is no cure for psoriasis
 isliye psorisis ke lakshanon ke prati jaagruk rahanaa bahut aavashyak he or iske kuch khasalakshanonko dekhakar rog ke ilaaj kii prakriya shuru kar deni chahie
 If psoriasis is not treated in a timely and effective manner, psoriasis can lead to many other ancillary diseases

 However, the condition can be kept better by timely detection and effective management of the disease
 twachaa rog visheshgy ke paas jaakar is rog ko pahchaanane main madad mil sakati he

 The Delhi High Court has reacted sharply to the Aam Aadmi Party poster tag line 'woh harassment hum, hum kaate rahe' against the Modi government
 court ne kaha ki is tarah ke mudde ke badale dilli sarkaar yon utpeedan jaise maamalon ke khilaaf radio or print madhyam ke jariye prachaar kyon nahin karti
 According to the rebuke court to the central government, such actions will increase awareness among people and people will be able to become aware of their rights
 court ne mahilaon ke khilaaf bad rahe yon utpeedan ke masale par dilli sarkaar ke alaavakendre sarkaarko bhi fatkaar lagaai he
 Both Governments insensitive court believes that both governments are insensitive on such issues
 dilli hoicourt ne centre sarkaar kii bhi khinchaai karte hue kaha he ki use mahilaon ke khilaaf bad rahe yon utpeedan ke maamalon ko rokna chahie
 For this, efforts should be made through audio and visual media

 What is amazing about Satya Nadella is the energy, concentration, and confidence of a yogi, which is reflected in his every move as he enters the Microsoft headquarters in Seattle, USA
 india today ke saath baatcheet ke liye sukun se baithte vakt saamaanya-si kaali tii-shart, gahari neeli genes or gaddedaar hill vaale snikers pahane 50 baras ke nadela behad chust-durust najar aate hai
 There is no extra weight or bulge on the lower outer line of their jaws, like a strong-saddle on a flexible
 apane ghute hue sir or dheer-gambhir abha ke saath agar ve bhagava labaadaa dhaaran kar len to aasaani se ghumkkad buddha bhikshuon kii jamaat main ghul-mil sakate hai
 Despite his hectic schedule and the onerous responsibility of running one of the most valuable companies on earth, Nadella seems to have struck a rare balance, which does not seem to bear the brunt of the glories of change and success
 nadela ke jehan main saaf he ki vah kya cheez he, jo unhen paribhaashit karti he
 They tell us that that thing is "living with intelligence in every moment", because they say, "that's what you got
" '' ve maanate hai ki aisa kar paanaa mushkil hota he—par yahi vah avasthaa he jisamen, gita main bataae mutabik, ek nashwar praani satv yaa purna chetana kii avasthaa ke sabase najadik aa saktaa he
 If you do not know them well, then you will not find the bravery of Nadella how they are giving new meaning to Microsoft
 is par unhone apni kitaab hit rifresh (jo 25 sitambar ko bazaar main aegi), khud unheen ke lafjon main, yuddh ke kuhase ke bich likhi he
 Computer gurus Bill Gates finally waited 20 years after Microsoft was founded in 1995 to write his brilliant book The Road Ahead on the future of technology
 bill gates kii viraasat sanbhaalane vaale steve bolemar ne 2014 main apni jimmedaari nadela ke haathon main saunpane ke baad unase kaha tha ki apane sansmaran likhane kaa unka koi iraadaa nahin tha kyonki ''ateet main peeche mudakar dekhnaa bahut ubaau'' hota he
 Had anyone else replaced Nadella, he would have been filled with panic, taking on the enormous responsibility of such unmatched founders
 duniya bhar ke arabon logon ke liye windos, verde, excel or power point sareekhe microsoft ke program naan, pizza or noodle sareekhee aam chijen ho gaye hai
 To understand how widespread Microsoft's presence is, visit its headquarters in Redmond
 1986 main bill gates or unke software ke yoddhaon ke kabiz hone se pehle sietal kaa yah upnagar uneenda shahar hua karata tha
 Its sprawling campus today spans over 500 acres, with 125 anonymous buildings strewn with their numbers (nadella's office is on the fifth floor of Building 34)
 duniya ke lagbhag sabhi 195 deshon main maujuudagi ke saath microsoft ke ab 1,24,000 karmchaaree hai
 Its annual sales totaled $ 85 billion — five times India's largest IT company TCS — and profits crossed $ 16 billion last year
 phir bhi jab nadela ne kaam sambhala tab microsoft ke upar tufaan ke badal mandara rahe the
 The shares of Microsoft, once a bluechip investment, were taking their steps into deep water
 kabhi personal computer (pisi) kranti kaa haraval dasta rahi company ity ke vibhinn morchon par pichad rahi thi or apane pratispardhiyon kii roshni ke peeche-peeche chalane kii haalat main pahunch gai thi
 Its software-driven desktop PC was at a standstill in sales, while Android and Apple reached the top of the smartphone explosion
 microsoft ne apple or samsung ko cell phone ke bazaar par kabja karne diya, search kaarobaar par google ko haaavee hone diya or amejan ko cloud computing main oonchi badhat hasil karne di
 When Microsoft conducted a survey among its employees, it was found that a large number of them were dissatisfied with the company, doubting its ability to innovate and worried that the company was going in the wrong direction
 company talmail vaali sanstha kii bajaae yuddhrat mukhiyaaon kii jaagiron ke parisangh kii tarah zyada kaam kar rahi thi
 In the same dismal environment, Microsoft's board of directors chose Nadella to replace Ballmer as CEO
 unka chunaa janaa har lihaaj se avishwasaneey tha
 In the hit refresh, Nadella keeps an eye on his rise, his leadership and his vision of the future
 yah khud apni or microsoft kii aatma kaa nae sire se pataa lagane kii takreeban aadhyatmik khoj
 This discovery Nadella 'who am I?' And 'why are we doing what we are doing?' Like existentialists do it by asking questions
 ve javaabon kii talash karte hai ki kaise ve, unka sanghathan or samaaj nai urja, vichaar, praasangikta or nai saj-dhaj paane kii khoj main kayapalat kar sakate hai
 In doing so, Nadella makes three distinct statements in his book
 sabase pehle ve khud apane kayapalat kii khoj karte hai ki kaise ve hindustan se america aae, phir microsoft main badlaav laane ke liye rifresh kaa batan dabaane kii ranneeti ke bare main bataate hai, or aakhir main philhal jari us chathi audyogic kranti ke saath darpesh maukon or chunautiyon par najar daalate hai jisamen mashinad intelligence jaldi hi inasaanon se hode kar rahi hogi
 Nadella writes all of this with rare honesty, clarity and clarity
 isamen aguai ke unke falsafe ke bare main gyaan or parakh kii prerak baaten hai or yah bhi ki kis tarah unhone post padati hui microsoft kii samskruti ke kayapalat kii apni koshish main iskaa istemaal kiya or kis tarah is vishaal company main makasad, disha or pahchaan kaa ek nayaa ehsaas bhar diya
 In both his book and the talk (see accompanying pages), Nadella describes how important events including his childhood days in India shaped his personality
 mannrsavaadi jhukaav vaale nadela ke iees afasar pita ne unhen sankeern kii bajaae bauddhik hona sikhaaya
 His mother wanted a Sanskrit teacher to be happy rather than hostage to any orthodoxy
 unke kamare main karl mannrs or samruddhi kii devi lakshmi, donon ke poster hua karte the
 Nadella's ambition as a schoolboy in Hyderabad was to become a professional cricketer and banker
 magar iity ke imtihaan main naakaam hone ke baad unhone karnataka kii manipal institute of technology se micro-electronics main ejineering kii degree lene ke liye apane sapane ko tilanjali de di
 However, his passion for cricket persisted (virat Kohli and Steve Smith are his favorite players) and his ideas about leadership are marked by the game
 namoona dekhie, ''cricket ne mujhe anischitata or dhamkee-dar ke aage puure damakham or jazbe ke saath muqabla karnaa sikhaaya
 Also, the importance of putting your team first, ahead of your personal figures and accolades
 ''dela jab america jaakar bas gaye, tab unke man main ganth ban sakati thi kyonki unke kai saathiyon ne iity yaa iiem yaa donon se grajuation kiya tha
 He did a masters in electric engineering from a small college in Wisconsin and earned an MBA degree as a part-time student
 kuch vakt san microsystems main kaam karne ke baad 1992 main ve microsoft ke saath jud gaye, us company kaa hissaa banane kii ummid main jo duniya ko badalane kii magarur mahatvakanksha ke saath kaam kar rahi thi
 The same year he married his family friend Anu, who was studying architecture in Manipal
 saal 1996 main unke bete jain kaa aagaman nayaa sankat lekar aayaa
 Shortly after her birth, she was diagnosed with acute cerebral palsy or brain paralysis
 nadela kehete hai ki apane bete kii takalif kaa khyaal rakhane se unhen ''puri tarah samarth logon kii zyada gahari samaj (di) or (bataaya ki) pyaar or maanviya saralata kya hasil kar sakati he—hamadardi mujhe jameen par or centre main banaae rakhti he
 "it taught him to be more sympathetic and compassionate as a leader
 uske baad lagan, himmat or dhairya kaa gaiyr-maamuli safar shuru hua jisane nadela ko microsoft kii chotii par virajman kar diya
 When he was elected in place of Balmer, Nadella did not run any of the money-lending departments of Microsoft (like Windows or Office) (both of which still bring more than 70 percent of Microsoft's revenue and profits)
 magar jis baat ne palada unke haq main jhukaa diya ho saktaa he, vah yah thi ki unhone technology or kaarobaar kii anivaary jaruraton kii khaasi pakki samaj dikhaai thi
 He also showed this when in 2011 he was asked to lead Microsoft's cloud and enterprise business that oversees Windows Azure and operates the leading technology
 bolemar ke bhimkaay, garajadaar or dabang taur-tareekon ke ulat nadela ko shant, vichaarsheel, dusron kaa dhyaan rakhane vaala or anivaary taur par team player ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 Gates, who had stamped the decision to hand over Nadella, saw him as a "humble, progressive and pragmatic" man who always "asked smart questions about strategy"
 kaman saunpte hue nadela ko salaah dete hue bolemar ne kaha tha, ''saahsee bano, sahi bano
 "the message was to throw the dirty things outside the window and press the refresh button
" nadela ne is lalkaar ko ek nae hi str par pahunchaa diya jab unhone microsoft ke vajood or bhavishya ke bare main uski ranneeti ke buniyadi makasad ko lekar karmchaariyon ke bich apane antarukaran main jhaankne kii jabardast muhim ched di
 He also decided to change Microsoft's culture and changed it from a 'know-all' approach to a 'learning everything' company, in his words
 iske liye unhone america manovaigyanik carol es
 Advocated the philosophy of Dweck, who believes that the matter is of a total mentality and that "the approach you take for yourself deeply affects the way you live your life
" '' dwek ne 'vruddhi kii maansikta' viksit karne par jor diya jisamen harek shaks itnaa taqatvar mahasoos karata he ki vah har vah kaam puraa kar saktaa he jo karnaa chahta he
 It also helped Nadella overcome challenges in personal life as well
 unhone dwek kii kitaab mindseta da new psychology of saxes kii pratiyaan apane sheersh netritv main bantwai
 Nadella also dived into the depths of the past, to find out what it was that led to the company
 microsoft software ke jaadu ke dam par kaayam kii gai thi or isane technology ko loktantric banane or nijee jaruraton ke hisaab se dhaalane main edi-chotii kaa jor lagaaya tha
 Gates' initial mission was' a computer at every desk and at every house '
 ab nadela se kaha ja rahaa tha ki ve windos se aage jaaen or nae daravaajon kii khoj karen
 They were also keen to break the image that Microsoft's functioning was to ruthlessly crush competitors (it had to respond to the US Justice Department under anti-trust laws)
 hafton kii bahes ke baad nadela ke maatahat microsoft kii leadership team ne ek mishan bayaan jari kiya jo munaafe kii khatir behatar technology banane bhar se aage jaataa tha
 It spoke of "making every person and every organization on this earth stronger to achieve more"
 yah paroapkaar ke tekon ke saath zyada udaatt mishan tha jisase harek karmchaaree or graahak ne acha mahasoos kiya
 As Nadella said, "my way is to lead in what we do with a sense of purpose and pride, not with jealousy and militancy
" ''dharmprachaarak sareekhe joshokhrosh ke saath nadela ne badlaav ke pahie ko teji se ghuma diya
 Posters sticking to the walls of Microsoft's Redmond offices emphasize the message "we enable"
 unamem se ek yah sameekaran teji se uchhaalata haih jajba+makasad+ manch = duniya ko badalane kii takat
 Another poster in the red color of the post office says, "do something different - do things, do different things, do important things
" '' haalanki kayapalat naaron tak hi mahadood nahin he
 Nadella made some all-round daring, difficult and painful decisions
 kaman sanbhaalane ke baad jaldi hi unhone microsoft ke 7 arab dollar ke nokia ke adhigrahan par taala daal diya, jo kahin pahunch nahin rahaa tha or 18,000 karmchaariyon ko nikaal diya
 The same year he took the hit video game 'minecraft' for $ 2 billion
 phir 2016 ke aakhri maheenon main apane kism ke ekamusth sabase bade saudon main se ek main microsoft ne 26
 Purchased online social networking site linkedin for $ 2 billion
 in do adhigrahanon ne soshal netwarking or video gaming plateformon par microsoft ko badi oochaal de di
 Unlike his predecessor, Nadella also started doing business with his rivals like Apple, whom he calls his 'friend-foe'
 microsoft ke liye ve bhavishya ke teen ahm kshetron par bhi bada daanv laga rahe hai: mixd reality, artificial intelligence or kwantum computing
 With this, they are hoping to make their company a domineering bull of this arena
 nadela kii koshishen pehle hi rang laane lagi hai
 They have not only brought Microsoft to the next line of high-tech innovation, but they have also generated more than $ 250 billion in market value since taking over
 kitaab kii bhoomika main gates ne nadela kii khub tarif kii he or likhaa he, ''ve ateet se katkar puri tarah alag nahin hue—jab aap apane broujar par rifresh batan dabaate hai tab pej kii kuch chijen jas kii tas rah jaati hai
 But Microsoft, led by Satya, has managed to get away from the Windows-centric approach altogether
 unhone company ke ek nayaa saahsee mishan apnaane kii aguai kii
 
 
 And most importantly, they are placing big bets on some technologies like artificial intelligence and cloud computing, where Microsoft will differentiate itself from others
 ''nadela un zyada bade muddon se nibatane main bhi gaharaai se tallin hai jo digital yug ne uchhaale hai
 Issues like privacy and security that have brought large companies like Microsoft under the scrutiny of both government scrutiny as well as pressure
 ve likhte hai, 'computer abhivyakti kii aazaadee ko bijli kii raftaar se failaa sakate hai, par rongte khadey kar dene vaali baat yah he ki sarkaar chori-chhipe logon kii baaten sunne ke liye technology kaa istemaal kar sakati he
 "they advocate more robust protection of privacy, modernizing laws to deal with the use of technology, and more carefully controlled access to data to enforce laws for security reasons
" kwantum computing kii ijad ke saath mashiinon or inasaanon ke bhavishya ko lekar mudde uthne lage hai
 There are also some deeper questions about how technology can bring a level playing field between rich and poor countries and how to make every industrial revolution worthy of economic growth instead of jobless revolution
 nadela ne abhi tak jo kuch kiya he, uske liye unke paas ek purabia jawaab haih ham zyada tarakkee kar rahe hai par hamen kabhi ruknaa nahin chahie

 ’aise fisali dilli-dilli ke saamne 167 ranon kaa lakshya tha or ek samay uskaa score teen wicket par 144 ran tha, lekin yahaan se ekadam se pasa palat gaya or maidan par 'kings' chaa gaye
 Indeed, Delhi scored only 8 runs from 17 balls and lost the remaining seven wickets in the meantime
 jab 4 over main 30 ran chahie, tab mo
 Shami came to do his second spell
 pant ne un par long on par chakka jamaaya, lekin shami ne agali gend par unka middle stump ukhaad diya
 New batsman Chris Morris was run out as soon as he arrived
 kuren ne agle over main pehle ingram or aakhri gend par herschel patel ko out kar diya
 Now Delhi's hopes were set on Hanuma Vihari (2), but Shami also uprooted his wicket in the next over
 kuren aakhri over karne aae or unhone pehali do gendon par cagiso rabada or sandip lamichaane ko bold kar hetric puri kii
 He became the third bowler to take a hat-trick from Punjab
 unhone ipel main sabase kam umr (20 saal 302 din) main hetric jamaane kaa karnama kiya

 loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi kii jabardast jeet ne kai manyataon ko dhwast kar diya he, iske saath hi isane kai rashtron ko sochane or apni nitiyaan badalane ke liye bhi majaboor kar diya
 Among them is the superpower America which changed its policy with the victory of Modi and opened its doors to Modi
 mahashakti america bhi ab narendra modi kii takat ko pahchaan gaya he or usne do took shabdon main ghoshnaa kar di he ki vah narendra modi ke saath milakar kaam karne ko taiyaar he
 With this, he has considered India as an important political player
 america raashtrapati baraak obama ab modi ke swaagat main khadey hai
 The US is dazzled by the Lok Sabha election result because such a situation was never imagined there 
 uske paas modi ke bare main pahunch rahi jaankaree yaa to aadhi-adhuri thi yaa purvaagrah se bhari hui
 The truth is that there has been a lot of bias in the US about Narendra Modi and there were two reasons for this
 pehla to yah ki bharat kii tathakthith dharmanirpeksh log lobiyon ne modi ke bare main kai tarah ke bhram videshon main failaa rakhe hai
 Secondly, the embassy in India is full of selfish elements that give only information of their choice to Washington
 baharhaal america taiyaar he narendra modi ke swaagat ke liye
 He knows that it is in his interest for India to emerge as a strong country
 bharat se dosti banaae rakhana or use pragadh banaae rakhane main uskaa hi phayda he kyonki bharat na keval uskaa sabase bada vyapaarik bhagidaar ban saktaa he balki sainya saajhedaar bhi
 America needs India, India is the only country outside of NATO that has great importance for America
 agar use china kii badhati takat se santulan banaae rakhana he to bharat ke sivaa or koi desh uski madad nahin kar saktaa
 Apart from India, there is no country in the region that thinks about stopping China's ambitions
 soviet sangh ke vighatan ke baad is kshetra main shakti kaa santulan gadabada gaya he
 Here China is rapidly spreading its wings and becoming a new challenge for America
 zaahir he ki aise main america ko bharat kii jarurat he
 On the other hand, America is basically a trading country and for that trade is the first preference
 iske liye use bharat kii sakht jarurat he kyonki 125 karod logon kaa yah desh duniya ke sabase bade bazaaron main se ek he or yahaan vah nivesh karne se lekar apana maal bechney tak kaa har kaam aasaani se kar saktaa he
 Extreme opponents of Modi who were thinking that America would stick to its old policies, would have been frustrated by this incident
 unamem ve kuth darjan saansad bhi the jo baraak obama ko patr bhejkar modi ko vija na dene kii salaah de rahe the
 India has really changed and so has America
 aksar kaha jaataa rahaa he ki congress ke bheetar bhi hinduvadi tatv hai
 There are people who sympathize and agree with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak, they also do soft Hindutva politics on many matters
 90 ke dashak ke baad is antar par charchaaen feeki padane lageen kyonki aarthik nitiyon or yojanaon ko lekar congress, bijepi yaa kisi bhi dal main fark mitane laga
 There is a similar line between Congress and BJP for ideological division
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh
 The Sangh also works hard to bridge the gap with the BJP
 aapane chunaavon ke vakt khabaren bhi dekhi hongi ki bijepi ko jitaane sangh ke sainkadon log bihar assam gaye hue hai
 Even the province head of Goa, Subhash Velingkar, was removed from the post because he wanted to form a political party
 raajnneeti kar rahe the
 This is the official statement of the association
 goa main weylingkar kii haisiyat sangh or bijepi main ustad kii rahi he
 400 volunteers have announced their resignation in protest against his removal from office
 media main aisi baaten chap rahi hai ki weylingkar bhartiya bhashaa suraksha manch ke mukhiya the jo bijepi sarkaar kii aalochana kar rahe the ki angreji ko badhaava mil rahaa he, konkani or marathi ko nahin
 There are different claims, with Velingkar being outspoken in the coming days, his side will also come out
 vahi bataaenge ki kya unhen bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko kaala jhanda dikhaane ke kaaran pad se hataaya gaya he
 This example is not given to discuss it, but because the Sangh does not want to work as hard as before to differentiate its identity from BJP
 ab aate hai rahul gandhi par
 Rahul Gandhi has been continuously attacking the RSS for the last few months
 sawaal he ki kya rahul gandhi zamin par utar kar aresas se ladane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Will Rahul Gandhi also throw Congress in this fight? kya congress kaa aam kaaryakarta or netaa bhi sangh se ladane ke liye taiyaar he
 Ready means whether it has an ideological preparation
 simpal shabdon main kya uski padhai hui he
 Will Rahul Gandhi fight with those sympathetic to Hindutva within his party while fighting RSS
 kya rahul ke netritv main maujuuda congress rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se sadak par ladane kii taiyaari main he yaa dilli main bayanon ke zariye hi ladane kii khanaapurti hoti rahegi
 There was no such fierce battle during the Congress governments, but is Rahul really Sirius? 2014 main maharashtra ke bhiwandi main rahul gandhi ne bayaan diya tha ki aresas ke logon ne gandhi kii hatya kii
 Defamation case was done
 supreme court main pichhali sunwaayee main aisa sunne ko mila ki rahul gandhi apane bayaan se palat gaye hai
 On Thursday, news came that Rahul would not back down from his statement and would face trial
 iske liye rahul gandhi ko bhiwandi kii adaalat main khud pesh hona hoga
 The Punjab Haryana Court sentenced Nathuram Godse to death on 21 June 1949 in the case of Bapu's murder

 If the Congress really wants to make any solid sense about RSS, then let's see and read what Rahul's lawyer Kapil Sibal says
 sibbal kehete hai, 'aaj jab maamla adaalat ke saamne aayaa to aresas ne court ke saamne hamaare liye ek bayaan kehane ko kaha, ki ham maanate hai ki aresas ne gandhiji kii hatya nahin kii or aresas doshi nahin he
 So we said that we stand on what we said earlier
 ham koi or bayaan nahin dene vaale
 If you think that the matter should be clear then we are ready for a court battle
 ye ladaai adaalat kii nahin he
 We will fight there only
 is ladaai main ye faisla hoga ki asli hindu koun he, ye faisalaa hoga

 ' Now come on Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi pichley kuch maheenon se lagaataar rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par bayani hamalaa kar rahe hai
 The question is whether Rahul Gandhi is preparing to fight the RSS by getting on the ground
 kya rahul gandhi is ladaai main congress ko bhi jhonk denge
 Is the Congress general worker and leader also ready to fight the Sangh
 taiyaar kaa matlab ye he ki kya uski vaicharik taiyaari he
 Has he studied in simple words? kya rahul gandhi aresas se ladate hue apni party ke bheetar hindutv ke prati sahanubhuti rakhane waalon se bhi ladenge
 Is the current Congress under the leadership of Rahul preparing to fight the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on the road or will there be reports of fighting in Delhi only through statements
 congress kii sarkaron ke dauraan to aisi ghamaasan ladaai nahin dikhi lekin kya rahul vaaki sirius hai
 In 2014, Rahul Gandhi made a statement in Bhiwandi, Maharashtra that RSS people killed Gandhi
 manahani kaa cese ho gaya
 In the last hearing in the Supreme Court, it was heard that Rahul Gandhi had turned from his statement
 guuruuvaar ko khabar ai ki rahul apane bayaan se peeche nahin hatenge or trial kaa saamana karenge
 For this, Rahul Gandhi will have to appear in the court of Bhiwandi himself
 punjab haryana court ne baapu kii hatya ke maamle main 21 june 1949 ko sunaate hue nathuram godse ko faansee kii sazaa di thi
 After 1949, the file of the case will open again in court and public
 gandhi kii phir se hatya hogi or mukadmaa chalegaa
 During the Bengal elections, the file of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was opened on TV channels every other third day
 chunaav biit jane ke baad filein band ho gayi hai
 It is sad if all this is happening for electoral politics
 agar vaaki congress aresas ko lekar apni koi thos samaj bananaa chaahati he to dekhte hai or rahul ke vakil kapil sibbal kya kehete hai vah bhi pard lijie
 Sibal says, 'today when the matter came before the court, the RSS asked the court to make a statement for us, that we believe that the RSS did not kill Gandhiji and the RSS is not guilty
 to hamane kaha ki jo hamane pehle kaha he ham us par kaayam hai
 We are not going to make any further statement
 agar aap samajhate hai ki maamla spasht hona chahie to ham adalati ladaai ke liye taiyaar hai
 This fight is not about the court
 vahaan to ham ladenge hi ladenge
 In this battle, it will be decided that who is the real Hindu, it will be decided
 'tippaniyan Sibal Sahab's statement goes far beyond the brief of the case

 unhone kaha ki unhen mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke ritairement se pehle apane biimaar pita or argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav kaa raajnneeti se ritairement kaa elaan karnaa chahie
 In fact, while addressing the program on the occasion of 22nd foundation day of RJD on Thursday, Tejashwi Yadav spoke of closing all the paths for Nitish Kumar's return to the grand alliance
 unhone kaha tha ki agar nitish jadyu se ritair ho jate hai to bhavishya main vah jadyu ke saath gathbandhan kar sakate hai
 Responding to the same statement of Tejashwi, Sushil Modi attacked him

 Taking a dig at the RJD leader, Modi said that he has acquired 26 valuable assets at the age of 26

 It was due to Nitish's clean image that Tejashwi got his first chance to become an MLA and a minister
 lekin ab vah unheen ke ritairement kii baat kar rahe hai
 On the occasion of rjd's foundation day, Modi also attacked Tejashwi for wearing a silver crown by Lalu's elder son Tej Pratap

 Good news for cine lovers
 1 july se lagane vaale jiesti ne cinema ke diwaanon ke chehre khilaa die hai
 After the implementation of GST, the entertainment tax will be reduced due to which the ticket rates in Delhi and NCR will be reduced
 centre sarkaar 1 july se jiesti lagu karne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Goods and service tax will be implemented across the country from a few days later
 isse kuch chijen mahangi hongi to kuch sasti
 If you are also among those who have a craze in cinema, then this news will definitely bring happiness on your face
 bataa den ki jiesti lagane ke baad dilli or ensiaar main cinema ke tikat saste ho jaaenge
 Rakesh, GM of Spice Cinema, said that the ticket price would definitely be lower, the ticket cost of the audience was more because every state used to charge entertainment tax according to its own
 ham tikat ke daamon par kaam kar rahe hai taaki bataur multiplex logon kaa zyada footfal aae, ye industry ke liye vardaan he
 The cost of kitchen may increase from GST, know what will be cheaper and whether GST will be imposed by different states
 ab cinema theatre main film dekhne par 28 pratishat tex lagegaa
 Currently, cinema halls in many states attract entertainment tax of up to 100% on films
 is tarah jiesti lagu hone ke baad intertenment services par tex kaa boj kam ho jayega
 That is, if you had to spend up to 200 rupees on one ticket, now you have to pay 150 rupees for the same ticket
 wave cinema noida ke manager yogesh ne bataaya ki tikat ke rates main zarur fark aayega aap dilli main hi dekh lijie south dilli ke rate or baaki dilli ke rates main kaaphi fark he
 GST All cinema halls will fall under the same tax slab
 apane parivaar ke saath film dekhne pahunche prem kishor ne bataaya ki ye acchhee baat he, ab log zyada se zyada filmein dekh paaenge jo pehle mahange tikaton ke chalate nahin dekh pate the
 At the same time, another cine lover Suman said that the cost of watching a film with the whole family used to go above Rs 2000, apart from the cost of popcorn and cold drinks separately
 jiesti se ab thode paise batch jaaya karenge
 Film director Sunil Darshan also welcomed GST
 sunil ne bataaya ki centre sarkaar kii taraf se ye acha kadam he, ab zyada se zyada log cinema dekh paaenge
 Now feel free to enjoy your favorite movie with popcorn and cold drink in the cinema hall
 GST lagu hone ke baad kaarobaar par padegaa ye 11 asar The expansion of the All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM), a political party limited to Hyderabad only last year, is proving to be a danger bell for the 150-year-old Congress? Know how? a 20-year-old stronghold Hyderabad1984-2014: Political party limited to the city> Since 1984, the MIM has consistently occupied Hyderabad parliamentary seat
 > 2009 ke greater hyderabad municipal chunaavon main MIM ne 150 main se 43 siton par kabja kiya tha
 2014: From city to state level party> MIM won 7 seats in 2014 Telangana Assembly Elections
 aglaa nishaanaa: maharashtra?haal hi main hue aurangabad nikaay chunaavon main prachaar karte dikhe asaduddin ovaisi
 2012: Nanded entered Maharashtra politics through civic elections and 12 candidates won
 2014: 24 maharashtra vidhansabha main chunaav ladaa
 Won 2 seats, second on 3 and fourth on 4 seats
 2015: aurangabad nikaay chunaavon main duusari sabase zyada seat darj karne vaali party bani
 Won 25 out of 54 seats
 jeet sirf muslimon tak simit nahinhaal hi main hue aurangabad nikaay chunaavon main MIM kii chunavi ranneeti kii jhalak dikhaai di:> chunaavon main naaraa tha jai mim (muslim), jai bhim (ambedkar)> 53 vaardon par chunaav ladane vaali MIM ne 13 gaiyr muslimon ko tikat diya
 It consisted of 12 Dalits and 1 OBC candidate
 > inamen se 4 dalit or obisi pratyaashee ne jeet bhi darj kii
 Of course, not every Muslim voter voted for MIM in the national vote bank elections but their influence is considerable
 > desh ke 76 jilon main muslim aabaadi 5 lakh se zyada he
 > Muslims make up more than half the population in 20 districts
 > 38 jile aise hai jahaan muslim aabaadi ek chauthai se zyada he
 Minority bets> There are 15 parliamentary seats in the country where Muslim class has more presence
 > 38 loksabhaa siton par muslim matadaataaon kaa pratishat 30 se 50% he
 > There are 49 Lok Sabha seats where Muslim voters constitute 20 to 30%
 strot: siesds, bijness standardlekin ye vot he kiskaa?> MIM kaa vistaar alpsankhyak or dalit voton main send lagayegaa
 > These new equations are alarm bells for those non-bjp parties who practice Muslim vote bank politics
 > beshak chunavi maidan main utarane vaale ye nae khilaadi jite na lekin congress kaa khel jarur bigaad sakate hai
 Is the increasing expansion of MIM a sinking sign of the minority vote bank politics of the Congress and the politics of the regional secular parties? This will definitely be seen in the upcoming Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh elections

 Kumble was appointed as the captain in November 2007 and then led the Indian Test team for a year
 unhone kaha, ‘main bharat ke liye 17 saal khilne ke baad captain bana isliye main shaayad captain galati se bana kyonki koi or aisa nahin karnaa chahta tha
 He said, 'rahul Dravid had left the captaincy and at that time it might have been a little early to make Mahendra Singh Dhoni a Test captain and Sachin (tendulkar) did not even want this, so he said that Chalo Anil is the only player and the captaincy gives him He only gives it
 ’ kumble panaji main ek samaaroh main bol rahe the
 In his 18-year bright career, Kumble has taken 619 wickets in 132 Tests and 337 wickets in 271 odis
 unhone kaha ki yah bhartiya cricket ke liye badlaav kaa daur tha, jab unhone captaini sanbhali thi
 Kumble said, 'I also knew that i was in the 17th year of my career and i would not be able to play for long so it was a period of change
 mujhe purv captainon or vanade captain kii team ko sanbhaalanaa padaa
 '41-year-old Kumble said that his captaincy was always 'inclusive' as he always involved the youth in making decisions
 yah poochne par ki vah apni captaini ke dauraan khilaadiyon se sarvshereshth pradarshan karwaane main kaise safal rahe to is sheersh leg spinner ne kaha ki vah apane saathiyon ke saath sahaj hokar rahete the or uskaa anand uthaate the
 As captain, India played 14 Test matches led by Kumble, losing five and drawing six draws
 unhone captain niyukt kiye jane ke turant baad bharat ko chir pratidwandvi pakistan par gharelu siries main 1-0 kii yaadgaar jeet dilaai thi
 Kumble said that Dagger as a bowler is very tough, especially in India
 unhone kaha, ‘agar aap gendbaaj ho to aap nayak nahin ho, aap hameshaa ek nayak kaa samarthan karte ho, lekin test match jeetne ke liye aapako 20 wicket kii jarurat hoti he
 In India, you select the team based on the pitches, so the bowler is changed
 agar yah terning pich he, to tej gendbaaj nahin khel saktaa or agar yah ghasiyaali pich he to spinner nahin khel saktaa

 The book begins with the article "day of Sunday", in which Talwar has described how the holidays become too difficult in the association of writers and poets and some house disrupts access
 ''jo log kuch nahin karte, kamaal karte hai'' lekh main unhone nithallon kii hawabaji kii khabar lee he to ''kavi nahin favi'' main kaviyon kii

 As you know, sexual crimes against women and children are at the peak of the country
 dilli main ek 8 maheene kii bacchee ke saath barbarta se balaatkaar kiya gaya
 The scream of that innocent still resonates in our mind
 kathua, jammu main tohaivaaniyatki sab hadein paar kar di gayi
 An 8-year-old girl was gang-raped for 8 days and then her pieces were thrown into the forest
 us ladki kaa katl karte hue bhi uske saath un jaanwaron ne baar-baar balaatkaar kiya
 What is most shameful is that the local leaders and bar associations staged demonstrations to save the accused
 khule main gum rahaa aaropee vidhayakunnavamein ek naaballig ke pitaaji kaa police or netaaon ne milakar castady main sirf isliye berahami se katl kiya kyonki unhone sthaneey bahubali vidhayak dwaara apni beti ke rape ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai
 Even today, the accused MLA is roaming freely
 desh bhar se aisi dil dahalane vaali khabaren lagaataar aa rahi hai
 Even if i imagine the pain of that 8-month-old girl or that 8-year-old girl, the soul shivers
 dilli mahila ayog pichley 2
 You have been requesting for 5 years to create a system in the country in which whoever rapes young girls, they should be hanged in 6 months
 is maang ke liye desh bhar se 5
 We also sent you 5 lakh letters
 par main bahut dukh mahasoos karti hum ki hamaare desh ke pradhan sevak is samvedansheel mudde pe kaary karnaa to dur bolnaa bhi uchit nahi samajhate
 Are you really not able to feel the pain of these daughters? Does 'beti Bachao Beti Padhao' matter to you rightly? Delhi became the capital of rape; Delhi, the capital of the country, is notoriously known as Rape Capital in the whole world
 kya is baat kii aapako zaraa bhi chintaa nahi he? 6 maheene ke andar mahilaon or bacchon ke yon shoshan ke cese main sakht sajaa ho, iske liye aapako police ke sansaadhan or javabdehi kai guna badhaane padege
 For 10 years, Delhi Police has been demanding 66,000 police personnel of Gir in Kadmo
 par kisi ke kaan pe jun nahi reng rahi!har police stesan aadhe staff par kaam kar rahaa he jiskaa sidhaa khamiyaaza janata bhugat rahi he
 The street stands at street corner, to tease women and girls
 dilli police aaj sirf VIP kii duty kar paa rahi he, janata kii duty karne main asamarth he
 The same situation is with the police of the whole country
 rajdhani krime kaa adda banisath hi police kii javabdehi to vaare nyaare he
 Today the capital of the country has become a hangout of crime
 maanav taskari or avaidh sharaab or drugs ke dhandhe chalaane vaale log police kii mileebhagat se fal-phool rahe hai
 For 10 years, the software which is being prepared by the software center to strengthen the functioning of the police across the country has not been made till date
 police rifarm ke naam par bhi kuch bhi nahin hua he
 Due to the acute shortage of forensic labs and fast track courts, the rape system of girls and women continues to occur repeatedly
 nyaay kii aas main aaj bhi desh main lakhon nirbhaya takataki laga ke baithi hai
 The Nirbhaya fund that was created in the name of the brave daughter of the country, Nirbhaya, is also not being utilized today
 nirbhaya ke kaatil bhi abhi tak jinda hai
 Shouldn't this fund create such a system that the rapists can be punished hard? Ever since we started 'stop the rape' Muhim, some states have passed laws in their legislative assembly in which rapists of young children are hanged There is a provision for punishment
 main ise achche kadam maanati hum par jab tak police ke sansaadhan, javabdehi evam fast trek corts nahi badaye jaaenge ye kanoon sirf kagaz ke tukade ban ke rah jaaenge
 You are the prime minister of all of us
 aap ke liye aisa mana jaataa he ki aap apana kaam nishtha se karte hai
 Then how can you ignore the interest of women and children? Do you not hear the blood path scream in their blood? Are you not listening to the minds of the people of the country in the glare of the system? Inspired from Modi, today you are fasting for a day to strengthen the democracy of the country
 lekin desh kaa loktantr kaise sudrudh hoga, agar mahilaayein or bacchiyaan lutati rahengi? main aapse apil karti hum ki aap apane anshan ke dauraan us 8 maheene kii dilli kii bacchee, 8 saal kii kathua kii ladki or unnav kii balaatkaar peedita or unke swargavaasi pita ke bare main zarur sochen
 Appeal to you today to ensure that the accused MLA of Uttar Pradesh (who is currently being rescued by the entire Uttar Pradesh government), his arrest and the security of the victim girl and her family is fixed
 saath hi kathua kii 8 saal kii mrit rape peedita ke khilaaf pradarshan karne vaale logon ko sakht sazaa dilaai jaae
 You are requested to take decisive steps in the interest of the women of the country
 mujhase balaatkaar peeditaaon kaa system dwaara balaatkaar nahin dekha jaataa
 The whole country believes that the Delhi Women's Commission has done an amazing job in no time
 hamane din raat mehnat karke saikadon mahilaon or bacchon kii madad kii he
 Till the time the system changes, there will be no strict action against rapists, till then how will it change? There will be Kathua, Unnao and Nirbhaya scandals everyday and we will all watch as idolized spectators
 main aisa nahin kar sakati
 Taking inspiration from your fast, i have determined that from tomorrow i will sit on indefinite fast
 jab tak aap desh kii beti bachaane ke sahi upaay desh ke saamne nahi rakhenge main purna anshan par rahuungi
 You are requested that 5 of the country
 5 lakh logon ke patr jo hamane aap tak pahunchaae, unhen padhein or aisa system banaaen jisase chote bacchon ke balaatkaariyon ko har haal main 6 maheene main faansee ho evam mahilaon ke khilaaf yon shoshan ke maamalon main 6 maheene main sunwaayee khatm kar doshi ko sakht sajaa mili
 Also get justice for Unnao's daughter and Kathua's daughter
 kehete hai sachche man se atyaachaar ke khilaaf kiye hue anshan main bahut shakti hoti he
 Our country has been liberated by the fast of Gandhiji and Bhagat Singh
 main aashaa karuungi kii aap apni beti kii tapasya jaaya nahin hone denge

 a 35-year-old ex-soldier was murdered in a liquor shop in Moga district of Punjab over kahi-suni

 Beant Singh, who lived in the village of Thathi Bhai, retired from the army last year
 gurvar kii raat vah gaanv main sthit ek sharaab kii dukaan par gaya tha
 Beant Singh noticed at the shop that illegal liquor was being sold there
 or uski keemat bhi zyada vasuul kii ja rahi he
 When the former soldier protested this, some people present there beat him up
 purv sainik ko itnaa maaraa gaya ki vah gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaya
 And soon after going home, Beant Singh died
 aaropee maukey se faraar ho gaye
 Police was informed
 samalsar police thane ke prabharee bhupindra singh ne bataaya ki sharaab thekedaar or uske chaar sahyogiyon ke khilaaf bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 302 (hatya) or 120e (aparaadhik shadyantra) ke antargat maamla darj kiya gaya he
 The deceased was a resident of Chida village

 The contract was recently sealed by the Excise and Taxation Department on charges of non-payment of excise duty

 The Reserve Bank of India has prepared a Declaration of Rights to give more rights to the customer, in which the five basic rights of the customer are mentioned
 ye adhikaar upyukt vyavhaar, eemaandaar dling, niztaa or shikaayat nivaaran se sambandhit hai
 This decision by RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan is undoubtedly commendable, but with this the demand for those other five rights related to the bank is coming again, which is so important to pay attention
 jaaniye kya hai wo paanch adhikaar jo har bank customer apane bank se chahta he
 
 1
 The one thing that a customer lacks the most for dealing with the work of a pen-bank for everyone is a pen, this is the most painful situation when you reach the bank and you know that you have to bring a pen
 Have forgotten duniya ke sabase vinamr vyakti ko dekhnaa ho, to use dekhiye jo bank main aapse pen maang rahaa ho
 In such a situation, the person standing in line to do the transactions of lakhs and crores comes to pay in the currency of beggar
 chaliye aap un laaparvaahon main nahin hai, jo pen le janaa bhul jate hai lekin kisi ne aapse maang liya tab? zarurat ke vaqt train or bank main diya hua pen kabhi nahin milte, isliye bank ko chahie ki pen le jane vaale or bhul jane vaale donon kii suvidha kaa dhyaan rakhte hue har customer ko bank main ghuste hi ek pen pakadaa diya jaae
 2
 pe par kol-ek kanya sabase zyada rachanaatmak tab hoti he jab wo apni bluetooth divaais ko naam de rahi ho or ek purush sabase rachanaatmak tab hota he jab wo lagbhag gale padakar beemaa yaa lone dene par utaaru agent ko phone par taal rahaa hota he, ye logon kii bhalmansahat hoti he ki itane par bhi apana aapa khoe bina pyaar se manaa karte hai
 The bank should either not give our number to such people, or automatically deposit the fixed amount into the account in lieu of every such call, those who disconnect the phone without talking, instead of taking such calls, should also get the money, the injured
 In lieu of thumb, the calls have been made while cutting
 3
 To avoid this line being cut in two-bank branch, stand in the line of ATM and think that what was bad then the bank? The bankers should not do anything else, even if they shorten these lines
 saath hi maheene ke ant main atm se nikaalane ke baad bachi hui raashi bataane vaale misegej band karne kii suvidha bhi honi chahie, har maheene beijjati sahi nahin jaati
 4
 aise to na dekho mujhe-sochiye ki aap bank sirf passbook print karaane yaa online banking ke liye i-mail kaa pataa badalawaane bank gaye hai
 Holding the hand across the glass, the clerk will look at you as if you are saying, here we are preparing to collect crores of money, you have to print the passbook? 5
 saans lene ke paise bhi le lo-bank kii shakha se kitne tranjaction, atm se nau tranjaction, duusare bank ke atm se paanch tranjaction, metro-non metro main alag-alag sankhya main tranjaction or agar galati se bhi zyada hue to har tranjaction ke badale paise, internet banking main har len-dein ke badale har baar paise, yahaan tak kii tranjaction kii detel bataane vaale misegej tak ke paise liye jate hai, kabhi-kabhi to lagata he atm or bank main jitne samay tak khadey hokar saans lee he uske paise bhi na charge kar liye jaaen

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of disrupting the development work of the Delhi government
 alag-alag maamalon main AAP ke teen vidhayakon kii giraftaar par unhone vyangy kiya ki party ke sabhi 67 vidhayak tihaad jail se hi kaam karne ko taiyaar hai
 He said, he has arrested three of our mlas in the last six months
 lekin hamaare paas 64 or vidhayak hai or is gati se vah das saal main bhi ham sabhi ko giraftaar nahin kar paaenge
 Delhi Police is behind our mlas, they do not have time to protect the people
 maine unase kaha he ki ham sabhi aatmasamarpan kar dete hai or tihaad se kaam karenge
 Kejriwal, who has been continuously attacking the Prime Minister in the last few months, said this while addressing a program to start facilities for increasing facilities at Burari Hospital
 yojana ke tahat aspataal kii kshamta 200 se badhaakar 800 bistar kii jaaegi
 Pointing to the ongoing controversy over the authority of the Delhi Government's Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB), Kejriwal said that Modi had captured it on June 8 using paramilitary officers

 The Chief Minister said, but on that day Modi sent paramilitary forces and captured our ACB

 2005 se deepika shah ek kamazor liver ke saath ji rahi thim lekin phir 2014 main unke doctor ne bataaya ki unhen jald se jald liver pratyaropan karwaanaa hoga
 The doctor said that Shah's family has two ways to do this work - either transplant the liver from the family or Deepika's name should be registered in the Cadaver Liver Transplant Recipient List
 doctoron ne parivaar ko donon hi vikalpon ke bare main vistaar se samajhaayaa
 On the one hand, you have to deal with a long list because there is no guarantee that any organ will be found within how many days
 duusari taraf apane hi parivaar main kisi se angadaan karwaane ke kai khatre or dar hote hai
 Deepika's husband Ramesh Shah says' i was scared, very much
 main faisla nahin le paa rahaa tha
 i did not want to be transplanted within the family
 isse mujhe donon hi taraf se nuksaan hota
 It took Shah a year to decide whether he wanted to get transplanted or not
 tippaniyan Shah explains' My wife is leading a normal life
 mujhe laga dawaaiyon ne us par apana kaam kar diya he
 But in my mind, i knew that i will have to take a big decision for extradition soon
 lekin us vakt main taiyaar nahin tha
 'but when the family saw that Deepika Shah's condition was getting worse, they decided to take a decision
 aakhirkaar 2015 main shah or unke parivaar ne transplant risepiant list main deepika kaa naam darj karvaa diya
 Deepika's husband says, "for the first time i saw hope in my wife's eyes when she signed her name in that list
" ' 2015 se deepika shah kaa naam kaaphi vakt tak vatting list main rahaa
 He finally underwent a successful liver transplant in October 2016
 vah abhi bhi aspataal kii dekharekh main hi hai
 She is expected to return home by next week

 deepika ke pati ramesh shah bataate hai 'main daraa hua tha, bahut zyada
 i was unable to take a decision
 main parivaar ke andar hi transplant nahin karwaanaa chahta tha
 It would have hurt me on both sides
 ' shah ko yah faisla lene main ek saal lag gaya ki vah transplant karwaanaa chaahate hai yaa nahin
 The comments shah bataate hai 'meri patni ek saamaanya jivan ji rahi he
 i felt that the medicines had done their work on it
 lekin man hi man main jaanata tha ki mujhe ang pratyrpan kaa bada faisla jald hi lenaa padegaa
 But i was not ready at that time
 ' lekin jab parivaar ne dekha ki deepika shah kii haalat kharaab hoti ja rahi he to unhone faisla lene kaa man bana liya
 Finally, in 2015, Shah and his family registered Deepika's name in the Transplant Recipient List
 deepika ke pati bataate hai 'pehali baar maine apni patni kii ankhon main ummid dekhi jab usne us list main apana hastakshar kiya

 The country's biggest 'gold loot scandal' in Bihar was robbed of a massive Rs 22 crore robbery from a strong room in Bihar, who looted gold, he was in jail! Anything is possible in his country
 bihar main ek nami finance company ke daftar main sone kii lut ho jaati he
 The robbers take away about 55 kg of gold
 desh main sone kii shaayad ye sabase badi lut he
 After the incident, when the police search the CCTV cameras, one of the robbers is stunned to see the robber's face
 jo luteraa live lutpaat karte hue camere main kaid najar aa rahaa tha, wo sone kii hi ek duusari lut ke baad pakadaa gaya tha or jail main band tha
 Have you heard of any such robber who is jailed and can commit the biggest loot of the country
 kya ye mumkin he ki jail main baithe-baithe koi luteraa 22 karod se bhi zyaada kii keemat kaa 55 kilo sona le ude or police ko pataa bhi naa chale
 23 November 2019, 12 o'clock in the day, bank lane of Hajipur, Bihar
 kyonki desh ke tamaam bade bank or finance companiyon ke daftar vahaan ek hi len main hai
 Hence his lane name is Bank Lane
 isi len main jagadamba state apartment main gold lone company muthut finance kaa daftar bhi he
 Where a 17-year-old minor boy reaches the office of this finance company in the shape of a customer
 daravaaje main daakhil hone se pehle baqayada suraksha guard ne puri talaashi lee
 And only after the consolation the boy was allowed inside
 badmaashon ne aise bolaa dhavamgar andar jane ke bajaae ye ladkaa finance aphis ke get par is tarah khadaa ho jaataa kii guard get band na kar sake
 And then only 6 crooks enter this office
 jab tak guard kuch samaj paata
 Till then, these miscreants take him under his control
 or ek-ek kar sab daftar ke andar daakhil ho jate he
 Everyone had a pistol in their hands
 pistal laharaate hue ye andar maujuud guard or company ke karmchaariyon ke saath-saath graahakon ko bhi pistal kii nok par lekar khamosh rahane ke liye majaboor kar dete hai
 And then begins the country's biggest looting incident in Bihar
 20 minute main 55 kilo sona safasisitivi kii tasviren naa hoti to is sabase lut kii vaardaat kaa andaaza lagaana bhi mushkil tha
 But it can be seen clearly in these pictures how the unscrupulous crooks are taking out the gold packets from the Strong Room of the Gold Firm and stuffing them in bags and bags
 puure 20 minute tak ye lutere company ke daftar ke andar lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam dete rahe or police ko isaki khabar bhi nahin lagi
 Finally, when the bags of these robbers were filled with gold, these robbers themselves decided to leave
 jab ye nikle to pataa chalaa ki pichley 20 minute main ye badmaash 55 kilo sona lekar bhaage hai
 Jailed miscreant involved in the incident! Hajipur police also identified some miscreants with CCTV
 magar is shinaakht main jo saamne aayaa wo yakeen se bhi pare tha
 Out of the total 7 robbers involved in this robbery, three people were identified
 unamem se ek apradhi mukul kumaar roy to pehle se hi jail main band tha
 17-year-old Mukul was arrested by the police three months ago in another case of gold robbery and put in a child improvement home
 to sawaal ye ki agar mukul jail main tha to hajipur kii cinema road main hui finance company kii lut ke baad saamne aae sisitivi main dikh rahaa ye ladkaa koun he
 How is it possible to be jailed at the same time and be caught in CCTV while carrying out robbery
 mukul kaa raaj kholana chaahati thi puliceek hi vakt main kisi apradhi kaa do jagah hona naammumkin he
 Therefore, without solving this mystery, it was difficult to go even a step further in investigating this biggest loot scandal in the country
 lihaaza is maamle ke liye rajya police kii special team banaai gai taaki is lut ko or lut main shaamil mukul ke raaj ko suljhaayaa ja sake
 How the minor jailed in jail came out 10 months before this biggest loot of gold in Badshahhazipur, 32 kg of gold was looted in Muzaffarpur, Bihar
 lut kaa tarika bhi bilkul yahi tha
 But even then the police could not catch the robbers
 baad main badi mushkil se bas ek luteraa haath aayaa, jo naaballig tha
 The Muzaffarpur police arrested him and sent him to a child improvement home
 tabhi se wo vahiin band tha
 Then how did he come out? a special plan made for loot In the day-long finance office, the robbers had made a very vicious plan to execute the country's biggest loot
 koun kya karegaa
 How to enter the company and how to remove sleeping packets from the strong room after entering
 ye sab pehle se tay plan ke mutabik hi ho rahaa tha
 Just as the robbers entered the company together, they did not run together after the robbery
 balki ek-ek karke thodi-thodi der baad nikalate rahe
 So that nobody on the road even realizes that there is a robbery inside the company
 CCTV main kaid ho gai sabase badi sone kii lootsisitivi se mili tasveeron main lut ke baad topi lagaae hua pehla ek shaks niklaa
 One who had a bag full of gold on his back
 phir kareeb 10 second ke baad gulabi shart main ye doosraa luteraa nazar aayaa
 It also has a bag full of gold hanging on its back
 is tisare lutere ne to had hi kar di
 He has two bags in his hand
 doosraa baari bharkam bag isane apane sir par lad rakhaa he
 Then this fourth robber appeared
 inhone apane bag ko is tarah bhar rakhaa he ki use uthaa paanaa bhi inke liye mushkil hua ja rahaa he
 The fifth robber also came out, carrying the bag on his back and hiding his mouth
 uske baad ye teen or lutere nazar aae
 But when he saw someone else coming from the front, he first changed his path but then went straight out
 in teen main se sirf do ne bag taang rakhaa he
 While the third is empty handed
 inke nikalate hi company ke andar hadakamp much gaya
 The miscreants did not try to hide the identity
 It is believed that 7 to 8 criminals are seen in CCTV, but this robbery incident may have been committed by about 15 to 20 criminals
 jisamen saat se aath andar daakhil hue or baaki baahar paharaa de rahe the
 Police have so far identified only 3 of them
 sabase hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki in bekhauf luteron main se kisi ne bhi apni pahchaan chupaane kii koshish nahin kii
 The faces of the robbers are clearly visible in CCTV
 lihaaza police ko luteron kii pahchaan karne yaa unke sketch banavaane main zyada dikkat nahin hui
 For this reason, the very next day, the police claimed that the robbers have been identified and their posters were also released
 lut kaa sargana niklaa mukul raay!sisitivi main kaid tasveeron se pataa chalaa ki finance company ke andar jis luutere ne lut ko lead kiya
 He is Mukul Rai aka Priyaranjan
 jo pehle se hi lut ke ek maamle main juvenil jail main band he
 17-year-old Mukul was involved in the robbery of 32 kg of gold in Muzaffarpur in February 2019
 iske alaava lut ke maamle main faraari kaat rahaa virendra sharma or samastipur kaa kukhyat vikaas jha bhi is vaardaat main shaamil tha
 Both of them were also involved in the plunder of 32 kg of gold in Muzaffarpur
 magar bada sawaal ye tha ki ek hi vakt main mukul naam kaa apradhi do jagah kaise maujuud tha
 It was yet to be revealed
 jail main band tha mukul raay!police ne badmaashon kaa poster jari kar diya
 Declared to reward the address teller
 lekin jaanch jaise hi aage badi to ek aisa khulaasa hua, jis par khud police ko yakeen kar paanaa mushkil tha
 The poster was released by the police, describing Mukul Roy aka Priyaranjan as the team leader of the loot
 wo to jail ke andar tha
 The entire police department was united day and night to catch the robber
 wo sarkari ricard ke mutabik 3 maheene se mujjaffarpur remand home main band tha
 Mukul was rescued after the photo of Mukul locked in his Sathyarimand home, the police reached Muzaffarpur
 yahaan khulaa mukul ke dabl role kaa raaj
 The information received by the police here blown the senses of the Bihar Police
 pataa chalaa kii lut ke thik 17 din pehle shaatir lutere mukul ko uske saathi chhudaa le gaye the
 It was revealed that on November 6, the police had brought Mukul to Hajipur court to appear in a case
 tabhi hajipur se mujjaffarpur lautne ke dauraan mukul ke saathiyon ne bich sadak par police kii gadee roki or pistal kii nok par mukul ko chhudaa le gaye the
 The big question before the police was that the robber whom the entire Bihar police was looking for
 uski khabar police ko kyon nahin thi
 Not only this, no FIR was also registered in this case
 lut se 15 din pehle bana tha plandrasal lut kii is vaardaat kii planning ke tahat hi mukul ke saathiyon ne lut ke kareeb 15 din pehle use police ke changul se nikaalane kii planning kii thi
 The 4 policemen took him for production
 wo chupchaap mujjaffarpur laut aae
 And the Superintendent of Muzaffarpur Remand Home also wrote a letter to the Vaishali Police about Mukul's absconding and postponed his responsibility
 magar dak jab tak vaishali police ko milti or mukul kii faraari kaa pataa chalata, tab tak mukul or uske saathiyon ne is sabase badi lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam de daalaa
 Disclosure of the great negligence of the police The story of the negligence of the Bihar police does not end here
 lut main shaamil doosraa looteraa virendra sharma bhi farvari main hui mujjaffarpur lut ke baad se hi faraar tha
 But with time, the police forgot to take the news of his discovery
 jabaki teesraa mastermind kislay bhi mujjaffarpur lut main shaamil tha or wo bhi faraari kaat rahaa tha

 The case of Sakshi marrying Ajitesh, daughter of BJP MLA Rajesh Mishra alias Pappu Bharataul from Bareilly, is in the news
 is bich soshal media par do tasveeron kaa ek kolaj viral ho rahi hai, jisamen ek ladki ke saath do ladke najar aa rahe hai
 In the pictures, the girl is seen kissing both boys
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki tasviir main najar aa rahe ladakon main se ek vidhayak mishra kaa betaa he
 An investigation by India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral picture was of Colombia
 tasveeron main dikh rahe ladakon main se koi bhi rajesh mishra kaa betaa nahin he
 The archived version of the post can be viewed
 Jay bhimnamaka fasebuk pej par yah tasviren aplod karte hue capshan main likhaa gaya he: 'rajesh mishra kaa chota betaa khud to chummi le hi rahaa he or apane doston ko bhi dilava rahaa he
 She is not the daughter of anyone's father, why be **? Legislator's respect is respect for common man's girls, what is the honor of the girls? To find out the truth of the viral photos, we reverse-searched one of these pictures, then we got a tweet from a Twitter handle called @ bazilkhann 
 13 july ko kiye gaye is twit main viral tasveeron ke saath capshan main likhaa gaya tha — 'main or meraa best friend ek hi ladki se pyaar karte hai, is baat par ham jhagadate nahin hai, hamane samjhauta kar liya he, yahi dosti he
 'this Twitter handle is being run from Karachi, Pakistan
 hamane @bazilkhann se sampark kiya, to unhone bataaya ki unhen yah tasviir internet par mili thi, jise unhone twit kar diya
 They do not know the people in the picture
 jab hamane in tasveeron ko dhyaan se dekha to peeche hamen sine colombia likhaa hua or logo dikhaai diya
 When we searched the keyword 'cine colombia in Mall' on Google Images, we found pictures of Cosmosentro Mall in Colombia
 mal kii ek tasviir or viral tasviir kaa milan karne par hamane paaya ki donon jagah kii floring, peeche najar aa rahaa khamba or sine colombia kaa logo mail kha rahaa tha
 On this basis, it can be said that this picture is not taken in Pakistan but in this mall
 hamane is tasviir ko ek baar phir internet par search kiya or is baar hamane kiwards main colombia ko bhi shaamil kiya
 We found these photos posted on July 8 on a Facebook page called Cuckismo Cultural
 yahaan tasviir ke saath capshan portugali bhashaa main likhaa gaya tha jiskaa anuwaad he, 'main or meri patni uske bwoyfriend ke saath
 'the thing to note was that both these pictures were cropped and posted here
 yani ki yah sambhav he ki in tasveeron kaa sorce kuch or ho
 However, information about who the three people are seen in the pictures could not be found
 yah jaankaree milte hi khabar ko apadet kar diya jayega
 In the investigation, it became clear that the viral photos had nothing to do with Vicky Mishra, son of MLA Rajesh Mishra
 haalanki rajesh mishra ke saath sathvikky mishrake khilaaf bhi kuch mukademe darj hai

 The Income Tax Department questioned former Chief Minister Rabri Devi and Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav for hours on the benami property case but the Income Tax Department did not get a satisfactory reply
 rabari devi kii madad ke liye unki beti or rajyasabha saansad misa bharti bhi ai hui thim
 Despite this, both of them said not to remember about the benami property and said that they will answer it in writing in the next three-four days
 is par tippanee karte hue bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki lalu prasad yadav ko apane bacchon kaa naam thik se yaad nahin rahata he unke bete kya benami sampatti ke bare main bataa paaenge
 Modi claimed that in his information, Lalu Prasad Yadav is the owner of about 150 properties, including his family and his years
 aapako bataa den ki susheel kumaar modi jab pratipaksh ke netaa the tab se hi wo lagaataar lalu yadav ke parivaar ke benami sampattiyon kaa khulaasa karte rahe hai
 How Lalu Yadav created a benami property by creating a company, taking a gift, a power of attorney, but now a will has also been added to it
 upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne khulaasa karte hue kaha ki bihar ke purv emelsi mo samim or unki patni sophia tabassum ne patna kii karodon kii jameen kii vasiyat lalu prasad yadav ke bete tejpratap yadav or tejasvi yadav ke naam kar di he
 In the will dated 12 May 2005, it is written that after his death this land should be given to Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav
 yahi nahin vasiyat main yah bhi likhaa he ki ye mere bhattije samaan hai ve or unke pita nishtha ke saath unki seva karte rahe hai tathaa unki madad kii he
 According to the will - i am giving this real estate to Tejashwi and Tej Pratap which will be effective after my death
 meri mrityu ke baad donon is sampatti ko apane kabje main le sakate hai
 - i shall not have the legal right of any legal heir or other on this property
 - yadi tejasvi yaa tejpratap kii mrityu pehle ho jaati he to unke vaidhanik utraadhikari hi iske maalik honge
 But two plots of 3354 square feet are still in possession of Rabri Devi as the power of attorney is in the name of Rabri Devi before her will
 patna ke saguna mode ke paas sthit is jameen kii keemat abhi karodon main he
 Modi raised the question that Moe Shamim and Sophia have three children, then why they bequeathed the names of Lalu's sons even though they are not close to him
 modi ne kaha ki mo samim kolalu yadavane rajyapal ke cote se 1998 se 2001 ke bich emelsi banwaaya tha
 He remained on the Citizens' Council for many years
 vasiyat isliye karaayaa gaya kyonki inakam tex main jawaab naa dena pade
 Modi said that he will give all the papers to income tax

 Sushil Modi alleges that even Raghunath Jha and Kanti Singh have given land to Lalu to become ministers
 lalan choudhary or hridayanath choudhary jaise forth class ke karmchaariyon se lalu ke parivaar ne gift liya he

 India has increased its activism under the leadership of PM Modi to achieve a leadership role in this organization
 is vajah se pad chhod sakati hai maharanibritain kii maharani elizabeth 92 saal kii ho chuki hai, isliye ab unke liye zyada yatra karnaa or sakriy rahanaa sambhav nahin he
 In Britain most of the work of the Queen is being entrusted to her successor Prince Charles, but the post of head of the Commonwealth is not hereditary
 isliye abhi yah saaf nahin ho paa rahaa he ki kaamanwealth kaa pramukh koun hoga
 India is preparing to play a major role in the Commonwealth of India
 yah duniya ke manch par netritv karne kii bharat kii aakanksha kii disha main pehla kadam ho saktaa he
 Significantly, the Commonwealth is an important organization which does not have China, so it is easy for India to play a leadership role in it
 bharat is sanghathan main apni sakriyata badhaakar agua kii bhoomika main rahanaa chahta he
 Many foreign newspapers have also started printing news about this by sensing India's growing activism
 times of india ke anusaar, is baithak main piem modi kaamanwealth ke liye bharat ke vittiya yogadan ko doguna karne kii ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 a Prime Minister of India is going to CHOGM for the first time since 2009
 iske pehle malta main yojit baithak main khud piem modi bhi nahin ja paae the
 According to Dinesh Patnaik, Deputy High Commissioner of India to the UK, India's role in various institutions is steadily increasing and the commonwealth is no different
 bharat to antarrashtriya paridrishy main netritvkaari bhoomika chahta hi he, britain bhi yah chahta he ki bharat kaamanwealth main zyada mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaae
 The Queen of Britain will probably be the last time organizer of a CHOGM conference
 is dauraan piem modi vibhinn rashtradhyakshon ke alaava maharani se bhi mulaakaat karenge
 It is not clear who will be the head of the Commonwealth after the Queen
 iske bare main windsar kaisal ke waterlu chembar main netaaon ke reatreet ke dauraan charchaa hogi
 During this time, various heads of state will meet private and issues like reforms in the Commonwealth, reshaping it can also be discussed
 buudhvaar se hi piem modi shuru kar denge kampiem modi buudhvaar se hi dwipaksheeya mulaakaaten shuru kar denge
 The CHOGM Dinner will be hosted by British PM Theresa May at its Badalandan Keskai Gardens
 britain ke saath dwipaksheeya baatcheet main 'technology partnership' par jor hoga
 The emphasis will be on 'make in India' by British companies

 Even after this, when the reporter did not agree, Ranveer shrugged and said, "what is going on, is it a 'goon' press conference or my inquiry
 nai dilli kii gol market main communist party of india (marxvaadi) yani sipiem kaa daftar vaise to in dinon suunaa hi padaa rahata he, lekin mangalvaar ko yahaan kaaphi halchal thi
 The reason for this was adjacent to the CPM office, one of the counting centers set up in Delhi
 voton kii ginati ke nattejey aate rahe or yahaan aam aadmi party ke kaaryakarta din bhar jashn manaate rahe
 Youths, women and men kept dancing and waving Kejriwal's posters in front of CPM office, raising Aam Aadmi Party flags and wearing white caps
 sipiem ne is baar aam aadmi party ke liye samarthan kaa elaan kiya tha
 What impact would this support have on the electoral outcome, but CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said that after him Mamata Banerjee, Nitish Kumar, Deve Gowda, Sharad Yadav and all the leaders of the Third Front started appealing to press the button on the broom
 sipiem headquarter ke saamne jab aap kaaryakartaaon kaa jashn ho rahaa tha to communist netaa or kaaryakarta use dekhne baahar aate or prasann bhav se bheetar jate
 Some of you were also seen patting the workers and congratulating them
 party headquarter ke bheetar tivi laga tha, jahaan vah santusht bhav se nateezon ko nihaarte rahe jisamen 'modi kii haar' ho rahi thi
 But the celebration of AAP workers in front of the red flag party is also a strong message for the CPM cadre
 sipiem kii dilli ikai pichley saalon main jo kuch hasil nahin kar saki, vah do saal puraani aap ne kar dikhaaya
 Did Arvind Kejriwal's experiment not raise the question for intellectual leaders and cadres following the red flag that the vote bank, which he believed to be in the grip of the BSP or the Congress, should actually be taken out and brought to him
 could
 aap kii yah jeet koi tukka nahin he
 Arvind Kejriwal and his supporters have organized an organized network of volunteers
 soshal media main sakriy hue, party ne ek planning kii or logon ke bich ek apil kii, jiskaa asar hua he
 Their workers have made inroads to the booth level
 isi baat kaa asar he ki aap ke paas aaj madhya varg ke saath us garib tabake kaa vot he jiske liye ladane kaa dam commered bharte rahe hai
 It is interesting that till the year before, all the workers in CPM office used to shout at the media for taunting Kejriwal
 vah kejariwal kii paith ko jaanboojh kar andekha karte, lekin aaj vahi left front kejariwal kii jeet par khush he
 The CPM and the rest of the left parties once had considerable influence in the states of North India, especially in Bihar, Punjab and Uttarakhand, but gradually this influence was dismantled and the comrades kept lamenting that their politics in the Hindi belt was caste- The politics of the Party has been swallowed up
 mulaayam-kanshiram kaa zikr vah aksar karte, lekin sipiem ke surajeet jaise netaa garib auki kamazor logon ke paas jane ke bajaay sipiem daftar se jod-tod kii udhedbun karte rahe yaa phir alag-alag partiyon ko secularism kaa certificate dete rahe
 a senior CPM leader once jokingly said that the 'certificate of secularism' has to be taken from Gopalan Bhavan itself
 isliye 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main kareeb 40 siten laane vaali samaajawaadee party ke netaa sarkaar main shaamil hone ke laalach main sidhe harikishan singh surajeet ke darvaaze par pahunche or kaha ki, 'main dharmanirpekshata ke maseehaa kii dahleez par aayaa hum'
 But today the Aam Aadmi Party has shown that it is neither necessary to become a messiah of secularism nor to polarize the religious like the BJP in order to build mass support
 yah sach he ki aarthik or saamaajik nyaay ke maamalon main laal jhande ke netaa zaruuratmandon ke liye khadey hue lekin media main use utani jagah nahin mili
 His numerous protest demonstrations on petrol-diesel prices and inflation were ignored
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki aam aadmi party kii tarah vamapanthiyon ne kabhi janata se judane or media ke zarie samvaad sthapit karne ke abhinav prayog nahin kiye
 This is the reason why people of left thinking and their sympathies along with other sections of society are happy in the victory of Aam Aadmi Party
 is chunavi nattejey ke baad sipiem ke kuch netaa is sach ko samaj bhi rahe hai
 Admitting this reality, senior leader Sitaram Yechury said, 'the party knows that we could not mobilize the anger of the middle class with the poor and the weak
 april main ho rahe party ke mahasammelan main is par zarur charchaa hogi
 ' kerala ke varisht netaa or paulitte beuro sadsy eme baby ne to daftar se baahar aakar naach ga rahe aap kaaryakartaaon ko badhai bhi di
 Baby said, 'it is true that we have not been able to do what you have done, which has to be considered
 party is par zarur manthan karegi ki jhuggi-jhopadi or rehadi waalon se ham kyon nahin jud paa rahe
 ' aap kii jeet main sipiem ke liye sabak he ki jatvaad or sankeern raajnneeti kii bediyaan todi ja sakati hai
 But for that a section of leftist leaders will have to destroy their arrogance as well
 sipiem ke hi ek netaa ne kaha, 'hamen soshal media or mukhya dhara kii media main apni soch or party program ko aage badhaane kii adhik prabhavi niti banane hogi
 Some comrades view the media as a class enemy, so that the dialogue is never established
 ye soch badalani hogi
 ' mana ja rahaa he ki april main sipiem netaa kamred seetaram yechuri party ke naye mahasachiv honge
 Is there a blue print on his agenda to connect the party to the mainstream? The Aam Aadmi Party has shown a way to the leftists

 It is feared that Harshvardhan may say on Thursday that he does not have enough numbers to form the government
 najeeb jang ne phone par harshavardhan se baatcheet kii or unase kaha ki vah sarkaar gathan ke vishay par unase charchaa karnaa chaahate hai
 The Delhi assembly election has given a fractured mandate
 70-sadasyeey vidhansabha main kisi bhi dal ko bahumat nahin mila he
 The BJP has emerged as the single largest party with 31 seats and its ally Shiromani Akali Dal has one seat
 aam aadmi party (aap) ko vidhansabha main 28 siten mili he, jabaki congress aath siton par simat gai
 JDU won one seat, while Mundka seat went to the independent candidate's account
 harshavardhan ne pitiai ko bataaya ki unhone uparajyapal se kaha he ki vah guuruuvaar ko chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ke shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil hone raipur ja rahe hai or shaam tak dilli lautne ke baad unase mil paaenge
 The Bharatiya Janata Party was ahead of the Congress in announcing its candidates
 14 november tak 162 siton ke liye pratyaashiyon kii ghoshnaa kii ja chuki thi
 Conversely, the Congress did not announce the candidates' names until this report was filed
 bhaajapa ke sabhi 200 siton ke liye ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa hote-hote uske aadhe se zyada ummidavaar badal chuke honge or kam se kam aadhi siton par nae chehron ko utaara jayega
 In some seats, tickets will be given to the existing mlas or relatives of the candidates who contested the last time
 party apane maujuuda 161 vidhayakon main se kareeb 50 ko dobaaraa mauka nahin dene ja rahi he
 Rebellion is also visible within the BJP as expected
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne party hikeman ko pehle hi spasht kar diya tha ki agar baari sankhya main pramukh netaaon or maujuuda vidhayakon ke tikat kaate jate hai, to party main badi baghawat ho sakati he
 Agreeing with his views, the party adopted a rigorous strategy and most of those whose tickets were cut, either accepted it or are contesting as an independent, which in many places benefited the BJP more than the Congress

 lekin bhaajapa ne kareeb sau siton par puraane logon ko maidan main utarkar ek bada jua khelaa he
 Most of these are loyal to Raje but Raje rejects any such thing of loyalty

 "until the writing of this report, the Congress list was not revealed, but it is being speculated that there will be many new faces in it
" rahul gandhi kii taraf se saaf aadesh he ki hamen agle do dashak kii raajnneeti ko dhyaan main rakhana he
 Highly placed sources said that given the prediction of Congress' chances of victory from all sides, Gandhi felt that it would be better to field new candidates because if he wins, keeping his politics in mind from that seat for the next two decades Works for the field while winning a veteran veteran means he will demand a ticket next time too
 duusari taraf, purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne jor dekar kaha he ki diggajon ko zyada se zyada samyojit kiya jayega
 Actually, Gehlot wants to reward his old loyalists
 gahalot ne yah bhi tark diya ki bhaajapa kai diggajon ko maidan main utaar rahi he, aise main congress kii ore se nae chehron ko utaarne se ladaai kamjor ho sakati he
 But the delay that Congress has announced in the seats in the process will have an impact on the campaign as each day is important and new faces are being overcome by this delay
 gandhi ne gahalot ke pradesh congress adhyaksh sachin payalat ko chunaav na ladgaye dene ke suzav ko bhi khaarij kar diya he
 Gehlot c
 Two former state presidents behind it
 pi
 Joshi and Chandra Bhan were also cited, who contested and lost as state president
 lekin gandhi ne spasht kar diya ki payalat ko kisi bhi keemat par chunaav laduya he
 Thus, Gandhi gave a clear indication that he had faith in the pilot and wanted him to carry out the responsibility assigned to him in 2014
 payalat ko 50 se adhik nirvachan kshetron se chunaav ladgaye ke liye bulaava mila he
 Meanwhile, Pilot also succeeded in signaling BJP MP Harishchandra Meena by joining the Congress that the Meena community has no problem with him or his Gurjar caste
 gahalot ke kaarykaal ke dauraan meena kai varshon tak police mahanideshak rahe the or phir bhaajapa main shaamil hokar apane bhai or kendriya mantri namo narayan meena ke khilaaf chunaav ladaa or jite bhi
 Pilot had earlier included Jaipur district chief Moolchand Meena of BJP in the Congress
 bhaajapa main mukhya baagiyon main rajya ke piechaidi mantri surendra goyal hai jinhone swatantra rup se chunaav ladgaye kii ghoshnaa kii he
 The BJP has cut the ticket of hardline Hindus such as Dev Ahuja and Banwari Lal Singhal, who spew venom against Muslims, although the candidate for Ahuja has been accommodated
 lekin habib-ur-rahamaan kaa tikat kaat diya gaya or raaje cabinet main bade mahatvapurn mantri younus khan ke tikat par ab tak faisla nahin hua he
 The BJP is not going to benefit any Muslim by not fielding it, but it will have to lose the votes of the Kaymakhani Muslims who are not only secular but proudly refer to the Rajputs as their ancestors
 younus khan prabhaavshaalee mantriyon main se ek rahe hai or ve un chand logon main se hai jinhone apni aakshamata ke liye bhaajapa yaa raaje ko doshi tehraane vaale zyaadaatar mantriyon ke vipareet, kabhi bhi party yaa raaje kii aalochana nahin kii
 But the high command feels that the anger of the people against the killing of Anandpal in the encounter may come down heavily on Younus Khan
 khan ko bhaajapa sarkaar kii sabase badi uplabdhi main se ek, gramin sadakon or rajmargon kaa nirmaan kaary puraa karaane kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 Pilot says that BJP has shown its true color by not giving tickets to Muslims and believes in discrimination on the basis of caste-religion-clan whereas Congress is beyond such politics and believes in selecting candidates on merit Does
 yah siyaasi aarope lag saktaa he lekin unuus khan jaise vafaadaar or sammanit netaa kaa tikat kaatane se use paanch siten hasil hone ke bajaae, paanch siton kaa nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Overall, the BJP list shows the coordination and mutual agreement between the RSS and Raje
 raaje aresas ke kuch aise ummidavaaron ko bhi samyojit karne par sahamat ho gai hai, jinaki haar nishchit he lekin isse sangh khush rahegaa or anya ummidavaaron ke liye kaam karegaa
 BJP has also given opportunity to Ashok Sharma from Rajkheda who has recently changed party
 congress kii ranneeti payalat ko mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main rakhane kii dikhti he lekin gahalot ko tikat dekar party ne unke bete vaibhav kii sambhaavnaaon par viraam laga diya he
 He will have to wait five more years to get the ticket because if Gehlot wins as an MLA, it is unlikely that Rahul Gandhi will give Vaibhav a ticket to the Lok Sabha
 lekin philhal ladaai se pehle ladaakon ke naamon ke liye lanbaa intjaar congress ke liye phydemand nahin hoga

 beete dinon, jab aam aadmi party satta main bhi nahin thi, akshardham ke paas jhuggiyaan dhahaane pahunchi endiemasi kii team ko unhone bairang lautaa diya tha
 The party argued that it is not right to render the poor homeless in this cold till proper arrangements are made
 is online petishan main kaha gaya he, 'nai dilli main kam se kam 50,000 bachche sadakon par rahete hai
 Many of them have been seen wearing the cap of the common man
 yah saraahneey he ki aapane satta ke saath milane vaali suvidhaon ko nakaar diya he
 So many government bungalows are lying vacant in the city and many are still occupied by people who have lost their rights
 chunki garimamay jivan jeena har shaks kaa adhikaar he
 Therefore, these bungalows should be converted into night shelters for the needy
 'is online petishan main sadak par rahane vaale bacchon ke liye kanoonee pahchaan, sarkari yojanaon or shiksha ke adhikaar kaa phayda or bal shram ke doshi logon par sakht karrwai kii maang kii gai he

 parade par saath jarur najar aa sakate hai
 By the way, both have worked together before in the hit film Ishq of the 90s
 ab charchaa he ki is film kaa sikval ban saktaa he
 If this happens, then once again the pair of Aamir and Ajay will be in front of the audience
 ab aap sochenge ye puraa masalaa aakhir he kya! to aapako bataa den ki in dinombadshaaho kii saxeska majaa le rahe ajay devgan haal hi main jab twitor par apane phens ke saath chat kar rahe the, tab unase ek sawaal poocha gaya
 The question was whether he would like to work with Aamir Khan again? To this Ajay Devgan replied yes without delay

 Of course, i would

 co / vhgpymteud — Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn) September 4, 2017 Ishq was a 1997 romantic comedy film
 ajay or aamiraki jodi ko darshakon ne khub pasand kiya tha
 By the way, the sequel of Ishq or both can get some other good script, but their fans would definitely like to see them together
 dekhne vaali baat to ab ye hogi ki aisa asal main hota kab he?bataa den ki in dinon jahaan aamir khan duniya bhar main dangal ko mil rahi saxes se khush hai
 Ajay's recent release Badshaho is also doing well at the box office
 iske baad diwaali ke maukey par donon actors kii box offis par bhidnt bhi ho sakati he
 On this occasion, where Ajay's Golmaal Again may be released
 vahiin aamir kii sikret superstar bhi usee vakt relies honi he
 Although Aamir is only in cameo role in Secret Superstar, but this is his production film, so he will not leave any shortcoming in its promotion
 vahiin golmaal ko har baar darshakon kaa pyaar hi mila he, isliye is baar aisi hi ummid kii ja rahi he
 Love began between 29-year-old Freida Pinto and 24-year-old British actor Dev Patel on the sets of the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire
 in donon ko dar he ki dobaaraa screen par saath aane se inke relationships par fark pad saktaa he or isiilie donon on screen saath kaam nahin karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Freida Pinto said, 'we feel that by working together in a film, we have played as much magic as we could
 baaki kaa magic ham apni personal life ke liye bachaa kar rakhenge
 Although both of them definitely work together in the kitchen
 freeda ne kaha, 'main ye nahin kahuungi hamen kooking pasand he kyonki ham donon main se koi bhi acha cook nahin he
 We debate when cooking but it is fun
 kaash main indian khaanaa cook kar paati to main los angeles main ek indian restaurant kholti
 There are no good Indian restaurants here
 ' freeda apane acting kariyar ko lekar bahut kamited hai
 By the time you see the show room of Enfield, it seems that how much Patna has changed, as soon as you enter Patna from the Ganges Bridge, the show rooms of all the automobile companies seem secretive of the hidden possibilities in the city but as soon as you remove the eyes from the show room Let's see you another Patna
 balki vahi pehla vaala patna dikhataa he jo bees saal se ek jaisaa he, betaratib or badrang
 Patna has no aesthetic sense of its own, Patna needs expansion
 use ab hajipur, bihata or jahanabad ko apane saath lekar badhanaa hoga
 These cities will have to be made Patna only then cities of Bihar will be able to become engines of economic growth
 patna ek tehraav kaa ehsaas karaata he, aapako maayoos karata he
 The city is overcrowded, its paths suffocating
 sadaken acchhee hai lekin jarurat ke mutabiq nahin he
 The people here are more aware of the sense and culture of the village towns
 jo patna main rahata he wo sirf patna main nahin rahata, uskaa ek paanv or ek man gaanv qasbon main rahata he
 One should study how many of the affluent people of Patna have built a house in Patna and one in their village or town
 vaise patna kaa ek man dilli mumbai or bangaloru main bhi rahata he
 Just Patna does not live in Patna
 patna kii apni boli bihar bhar kii boliyon se takaraati rahati hai
 When the city has no character about the language, then the city can have its own character
 meri nazar se yahi patna kii khubi he
 No capital of India will see such a variety of dialects
 isliye aapako dilliwaala yaa kalakattawala kii tarah koi puri tarah se patnavala nahin milegaa
 To be an urbanist it is necessary to have a weak connection to the past, to be futuristic
 bihar ek gramin rajya he isliye uske shaharon kaa kasbaai charitra hoga hi lekin badalte bihar kii aakankshaayen ab behatar or kisi bade shahar kii talash main baichaiyn hai
 Many flyovers have been made in Patna, but soon all will be jammed
 yahaan ke log mahangi car kareed legein lekin kabhi bas se nahin chalegein
 There should be a system of public transport from the government and in this case Patna is a complete failure, but the city will have to be free from feudal thinking first
 ek tabaqa aaazaad bhi hua he lekin uske liye bhi shahar taiyaar nahin he
 If you want, you can consider rickshaw as public transport
 bangladesh kii rajdhani dhaka kii tarah yah ek aisi rajdhani he jo rikhshaavaalon ko lekar sahansheel he
 The city has allowed the rickshaw pullers to live
 bade mahanagaron kii tarah unke liye jagah tay nahin kii he
 In Delhi, people have filled every empty space by buying cars for hobby
 chunki wo car he isliye logon ko lagata he ki taraqqi he lekin yahi kya kam he ki patna ne rickshaw se lagane vaale jam ko bhi usee tarah se sweekaar kiya he jaise dilli main ham kaaron ke prati samvedansheel hote hai
 There is no difference between the jam with the car and the rickshaw
 bas ek jam main amiri jhalkati he or ek jam main amiron ko gandagi dikhti he
 Today, all the cities of India are dying because of these cars, they are not worth living
 lekin madhyamvarg garib virdohi hota he, wo intazaar kar rahaa he ki kab rickshaw hate or wo apni kaaron se shahar ko bhar de
 Patna, despite being an underdeveloped city, can and should be satisfied that it has given place to poor and homeless rickshaw pullers
 garibon ko bhi lagata he ki shahar ke saundarya kii khaatir use koi visthapit nahin kar saktaa, ye shahar garib virdohi nahin he
 Apart from this one index, one should also think about what else is there in Patna
