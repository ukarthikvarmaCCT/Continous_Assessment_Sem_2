chemical atake ke baad syrian sarkaar ke hawaii thikaanon par america hamale shuru hone se america or rus ke bich takaraav ke halaat paidaa ho gaye hai
 The Russian army is also present along with the Syrian security forces in the area of the US which is attacking Syria
 aise main america hamale main roosi suraksha balon ke hataahat hone kii puri sambhaavna he
 Earlier, the Russian ambassador has warned the US against the attack on Syria
 pentagon kii ore se jari bayaan main kaha gaya he ki america sena roosi or syrian suraksha balon ko lekar satarkta barat rahi he
 The US is trying to minimize the damage to Russian and Syrian security personnel present in the attack
 is chemical hamale main 100 se zyada logon kii maut ho chuki he, jabaki 400 se zyada log ghayal ho chuke hai
 At the same time, the US Secretary of State is going to visit Russia soon
 unke daure kaa makasad america or rus ke bich sambandhon ko behatar karnaa he
 US said - The information was given about the attack, after the attack on Russia's air bases of Russia, the US said that it had been informed to Russia before the attack
 haalanki rus kaa kahana he ki america ne isaki sahmati nahin lee he
 In response, the Americans said that they had informed Russia to launch the attack, but they did not need to get approval from Russia
 rus ne kaha ki america ke is hamale se duniya ke sabase khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan islamic state (aies) kaa khaatmaa karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 Accusing Syrian President of Chemical Attack On Tuesday, the US blamed the Syrian President for the chemical attack in Idlib, Syria, while Russia is openly supporting Syrian President Bashar al-assad
 usne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main bhi bashar kaa samarthan kiya, jiske chalate rus kii duniya bhar main aalochana ho rahi he
 Russia and Syrian President accuse rebel groups of Syrian President Bashar al-assad and Russia's US accusations of carrying out a chemical attack
 rus or asad kaa kahana he ki vidrohi guton ne is chemical atake ko anjaam diya he
 Since this attack, an already fierce verbal war between Russia and the United States continues
 aise main america kii ore se 60 krooj misile daagi jane tanaav gaharaa gaya he
 us-russia relations will not improve even after Trump's arrival; Russia and US relations deteriorated during former US President Barack Obama's rule over Syria, but this is being said after Donald Trump's proximity to Russian President Vladimir Putin It was said that now the relationship between the two countries will improve, but after the chemical attack in Syria, this hope seems to be blurred
 chemical atake ke baad se trump ke badale rukh ke chalate donon deshon ke bich sambandh phir se tanaavpurn ho gaye hai
 From the beginning, the US is in favor of ousting Assad from Syria, while Russia is supporting Assad
 rus asad kii ore se syrian vidrohiyon or aies aatankiyon par lagaataar hawaii hamale kar rahaa he
 US lawmakers supported Trump, US President Donald Trump's order to take military action after a chemical attack on Syria is being widely appreciated in the US
 trump ke aalochak rahe kai america saansad bhi unke is faisle kii tarif kar rahe hai
 However, some mps have raised questions about taking military action without voting in Congress

 team india janvari main australia ke daure par jane vaali he
 There he has to play 5 odis and three T20 matches
 is bich aisi sambhaavna ban rahi he ki team india ke khilaaf australian team kii captaini steven smith nahin, balki david warner ko saunpi ja sakati he
 Australia captain Smith has suffered a hip and ankle injury and will be judged only after the Test series against the West Indies
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki aane vaale tii-20 vishwa-cap ko dhyaan main rakhte hue australian chayankarta nahin chahenge ki captain smith kii chot or bade
 In view of this, Smith has separated himself from Australia's famous Big Bash League and will not play in it
 tippaniyan Australia coach Deron Lehman believes Smith is 26 years old, but is running on the field like a 36-year-old
 wo australia ke bhavishya ke liye behad ahm hai or hamen unhen sahi samay par aaraam dena padegaa
 Amidst all this, David Warner can get a command against India, which will be a new experience for this aggressive left-handed batsman
 pichley saal jab team india australian daure par gai thi, tab warner kai maukon par bharat ke captain viraat kohli or kuch anya sadasyon ke saath maidan par ulajh gaye the
 In such a situation, this tour can be interesting if they get command
 australia ke captain smith ko hip or takhne main chot lagi he or westeindies ke khilaaf ho rahi test siries ke baad hi aanka jayega ki wo kitne feet hai
 But it is believed that keeping in mind the upcoming T20 World Cup, the Australian selectors will not want to further aggravate Captain Smith's injury
 isi ke maddenjar smith ne khud ko australia kii mashhoor big bash lig se alag kar liya he or usamen nahin khelenge
 The comments australia ke coach deran liman kaa maananaa he ki smith abhi 26 saal ke hai, lekin maidan par aise daud rahe hai jaise ki 36 saal ke hon
 They are very important for the future of Australia and we have to give them rest at the right time
 in sabake bich david warner ko bharat ke khilaaf kaman mil sakati he jo is akramak baayen haath ke ballebaaj ke liye ek nayaa hi anubhav hoga
 When Team India went on an Australian tour last year, Warner got involved on the field with India's captain Virat Kohli and some other members on several occasions

 More time has passed, but Asaram is not taking the name of Bapu's troubles
 logon ko unki mushkilon se nijaat dilaane kaa daawa karne vaale asaram aaj khud apni museebaton ke janjaal main ulajh kar rah gaye hai or janjaal bhi aisa kii ab naa to koi sadhana kaam main aa rahi he or naa hi koi tantra-matra
 Asaram, who had crossed the eyes of his devotees at Bhavsagar, is today getting himself entangled in the whirlpool of court dates
 asaram kaa puraa kutumb paap ke jehar se tilamila rahaa he
 Is sparring ab naa jaadu tona chal rahaa he
 Neither the practice of tantra mantra
 paakhand ke bhagwaan kii hawa gul ho gai he
 Asaram had sown the thorns of slander, shamelessness and misdeeds in his past, now he is sucking blood
 din main, raat main, jail kii badalati karvaton main, puri puri raat khuli ankhon kii khidakiyon main, baar-baar khaarij hoti jamaanat kii arji main, ahmedabad police kii transit remand main
 The seclusion that Asaram had created for his exile has now become an unknown place for Asaram's clan
 paakhand kaa tikaa lagaakar asaram puri kutumb naa jane koun se bill main chup gaya he
 Baba's clan is absconding and the curtain of sins is only rising
 kabhi balaatkaar or yon shoshan ke aaropon main to kabhi paakhand kii kutiyaa ke bade bade khulaason se
 The number of girls accusing Asaram and Family is increasing
 har roj koi naa koi ladki sansanikhej aarope lekar saamne aa rahi he
 So disgusting truth is coming out of Asaram's ashrams
 kabhi besaram beemaari banakar to ab besaram booti banakar
 The secret that came out of Asaram's ashram first came when the secret of Asaram's meditation hut came out
 lekin ab unke ashram se jo rahasy niklaa he use sun kar aap hairaan rah jaaenge
 During a raid by the Food and Drug Department, Asaram's ashram found a stock of drugs that are considered sex enhancers
 food and drug vibhaag kaa ye bhi kahana he ki asaram ke ashram main pakadi gai dawaaon main aise rasayan kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, jisaki ijaajat unhen nahin di gai he
 Surat police are killing Asaram's ashrams Red after two sisters were accused of rape and sexual exploitation
 police kii chhapemari main bhale hi asaram kaa kunba abhi tak naa mila ho lekin surat ke ashram main food and drug vibhaag ko besaram booti mili he
 Asaram, who wandered around the world talking about Bhagwat devotion, was first accused of having a Bersham disease, ie pedophilia
 wo peedophileo jiskaa shikaar hone ke baad insaan ko bacchon se jismani rishte bananaa acha lagata he or ab asaram ke ashram se besaram booti kaa rahasy khulaa he
 Asaram's ashram was stocked with such medicines
 jo sex vardhak maani jaati hai
 The nameless boot that has been found from the ashram of Asaram is the name of sapta dhatva booster
 food and drug vibhaag kaa ye bhi kahana he ki asaram ke ashram main pakadi gai dawaaon main aise rasayan kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, jisaki ijaajat unhen nahin di gai he
 In raids from Jahangirpur Ashram in Surat of Asaram, not only have the drugs been added, but also 5 other drugs whose chemical is suspected by the Food and Drug Department and the names of those drugs are - Banabi, Triphala Tablet, Amla Churna , Cough syrup and chemical tablets
 food and drug vibhaag ne asaram ke ashram se mili sandigdh or sex vardhak dawaaon ke sample jaanch ke liye bhej die hai
 That is, for Baba, the power enhancing herb can become a powerful booster
 puure parivaar par aropasaram to asaram unka puraa parivaar ladakiyon ke yon shoshan ke aaropon main ghira hua he
 Is son Narayan Sai, is daughter Bharati and wife is Lakshmi
 sabhi par sangeen aarope lage hai
 Surprisingly, the entire family of Asaram, who teaches the world the lesson of truth and non-violence, has been missing ever since he was accused and the police are searching for them all
 asaram ke parivaar kaa sachnarayan sai ne asaram kii begunaahi kii badi daleelein deen
 Every effort was made to get them out of the prison bars
 lekin narayan apni is koshish main kaamyaab nahin ho paae
 He himself was charged with rape and he was absconded as soon as the police issued a lookout notice against him
 asaram kii beti bharti asaram or narayan sai par balaatkaar ke aaropon main ghirne or ladakiyon ko yon shoshan maamle main apana naam aane ke baad bharti khud kahin gaayab ho gai he
 Not only son and daughter but also Asaram's wife Lakshmi are missing
 un par bhi asaram kii raasalilaon main saath dene kaa aarope he
 
 
 Asaram's wife Lakshmi is accused of arranging for the girls to reach Asaram
 naa sirf karatuut ko anjaam dene ke tareeke, balki iljaam lagane ke baad kanoon se bachane ke hatkandaa bhi narayan sai ne vahi chunaa he, jo unke pita asaram ne chunaa tha
 
 
 But it seems that Asaram and his entire family have now been surrounded by their own bed in a bid to escape the law
 asaram ko abhi kuch din or jail main hi bitaane honge
 Jodhpur court has given transit remand of Asaram to Gujarat Police
 yani ab gujarat police asaram ko ahmedabad le jaakar unase poochtacha karegi or asaram ko 25 aktubar tak jail main rahanaa padega
 The countdown for the arrest of Asaram's clan has started
 jodhpur jila adaalat ne gujarat police ko asaram kii transit remand de di he
 Now on one side, Narayan Sai is sending anticipatory bail, while on the other hand Asaram is pleading with the victim's lawyer
 shuukravaar ko jodhpur court main jamaanat arji khaarij hone ke baad asaram sidhe peedit ladki ke vakil ke paas pahunch gaye
 And said with folded hands
 sahaara samooh ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki vaikalpik purna parivartaneey rin patron (oefasidi) ke jariye jutaaye gaye dhan ko vibhinn aastiyon main lagaaya gaya tha or samooh kii companiyon ne jarurat padane par dhan uplabdh karaayaa taaki niveshkon ko punarbhugtan kiya ja sake
 Significantly, the Supreme Court today asked the Sahara Group from which sources it had raised Rs 25,000 crore and paid it to the investors in cash
 nyaayalay ne samooh se kaha ki vah yah raashi jutaney ke sroton kaa khulaasa kar paak saaf hokar saamne aae
 Sahara Group later said in a statement about this, 'it would be relevant to state that Sahara operates through about 5000 branches across the country and this payment was made only through those branches
 ' iske anusaar, 'sahaara kii shakhaon ke akhil bhartiya network ke jariye hi company ne dhan lautaaya (rifund kiya) he
 The group, through its counsel, has stated that the original copies of all the documents related to these repayments and original brand certificates returned by the investors have been handed over to SEBI
 tippaniyan It is noteworthy that a bench headed by Chief Justice TS Thakur told the Sahara group during the hearing, "you tell me what is the source of this money? Did you get Rs 24,000 crore from other companies and other schemes? Withdraw money from bank accounts ? Or raise this amount by selling the property? It will be through one of these three means
 paisa upar se nahin girtaa
 You have to tell where you got this money from

 'he said,' While playing for the country for 24 years, i faced different challenges but with the help of family, coaches, friends and fellow players, this journey was a golden one
 mujhe kal (shanivaar) raat tak yakeen nahin ho rahaa tha ki ab kahin nahin kheloongaa
 But i have no regrets
 yah sahi vakt tha or maine apane 24 saal ke safar kaa puraa majaa liya

 "it was emotional while talking to the wicket" Sachin also said that he tried his best to keep his emotion on the field during the farewell but could not stop the tears while talking to the wicket
 unhone kaha, ‘us samay mujhe laga ki main ab kabhi bharat ke liye nahin kheloongaa to main kaaphi bhavuk ho gaya
 i felt that i was playing in the stadium for the last time

 It is difficult to express that feeling but despite all this i feel that my decision was right

 com / xsszzya6rr About a week ago, Australia had a 2–0 lead in the ODI series against England, but the English team won the series two consecutive matches and brought the series on par

 In the fifth and final ODI of the series, England will take the field with increased morale

 At the same time, Australia has a chance to end the tour of England with a win after the Ashes defeat
 english team kii shandaar vaapasi ke peeche captain ian morgan kaa khaas role rahaa
 Morgan's bat continued to flourish, due to which England succeeded in making a comeback in the series
 morgan ne chaar main se teen vanade main ardhshtak banaae, jisamen se do main unki haaf-centuri jeet main kaam ai
 At the same time, another batsman of the team, Jason Roy, has also impressed everyone
 roy ne series main do haaf-centuri banaai he, lekin unhen apni pich par tikne kii kala seekhni hogi
 On the other hand, Pat Cummins has bowled well for Australia
 series main unke naam 12 wicket hai, lekin baaqi ke gendbaazi kuch khaas kamaal nahin dikhaa sake hai
 The comments jahaan tak mehmaan team kii ballebaazi kii baat he to team ke opebers chalate hai to madhyamkram ke ballebaaz ladkadaa jate hai or kabhi ulta hota he
 In the fourth ODI, the top order flopped and three wickets fell for 30 runs, while in the third ODI, captain Steven Smith, George Bailey and Glenn Maxwell managed only 77 runs
 vaise donon timen aane vaale vyast sizan ko dekhakar khilaadiyon ko aazamaa rahi hai
 Looking at the form of both teams, Fans will get to see another great match in the series decider

 Captain Ian Morgan's special role was behind the spectacular return of the English team
 morgan ke balle kaa jalawaa hi rahaa, jisaki vajah se england series main vaapasi karne main safal rahaa
 Morgan scored half-centuries in three odis out of four, two of which helped his half-century win
 vahiin team ke ek or ballebaaz jesan roy ne bhi sabko prabhavit kiya he
 Roy has scored two half-centuries in the series, but will have to learn the art of sticking to his pitch
 duusari ore australia ke liye pat kumins ne acchhee gendbaazi kii he
 He has 12 wickets in the series, but the rest of the bowlers have not been able to show anything special
 tippaniyan As far as the batting of the visiting team is concerned, if the team's openers go, then the middle-order batsmen falter and sometimes reverse
 chauthe vanade main top order flop rahaa or 30 ran par teen wicket gir gaye, jabaki tisare vanade main captain steven smith, jorge beli or glen maxwell sirf 77 ran bator paae
 However, both the teams are trying out the players by watching the upcoming busy season

 com / Mjg4? tamp_id = Mjg4 vampanthi partiyaan jahaan loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle teesraa morcha banane kii jugat main lagi hai, vahiin chauthi takat bhi ubhartee najar aa rahi he
 On 24 December, 56-year-old head of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) Babulal Marandi caught a flight from Ranchi to Delhi as Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, a Rajya Sabha member of the Janata dal-united (JD-U)
 si
 The alliance was to be finalized at Tyagi's house
 aapas main aupchaarik gathbandhan banane ke baad jedy (you) or jeviem ab orissa ke mukhyamantri naveen patnayak or pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ko bhi apane saath laane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 This alliance may be new but its purpose is old that anyone can emerge as a winner if a divided mandate comes
 is gathbandhan kii shuruyaat karne vaale babulal marandi ke paas loksabhaa main mahaj do saansad hai lekin unke iraade oonche hai
 This belief of Marandi is not only in the air, but because of the number of Lok Sabha seats given by joining these four states
 bihar, jharkhand, pashchim bengal or orissa ko jodakar loksabhaa siton kii sankhya 117 he, jo loksabhaa kii kul siton kii sankhya ke paanchaven hisse se bhi zyada he
 At present there are 55 mps including Trinamool Congress (TMC), Biju Janata Dal (BJD), Janata dal-united and JVM
 marandi kehete hai, ‘‘2014 main yah sankhya or bad sakati he
 We can get more seats than before
 ’’kareeb 13 saal pehle november, 2000 main skool teacher marandi jharkhand ke pehle mukhyamantri bane the
 They are well aware of the pros and cons of coalition politics
 march, 2003 main unhen bijepi ke mukhyamantri ke taur par kursi chhodmai padi thi kyonki gathbandhan ke sahyogiyon ne unke khilaaf baghawat kar di thi
 In such a situation, instead of supporting the BJP, Arjun Munda was given the chair in his place
 marandi ne may, 2006 main party chhod di or jeviem naam se nai party bana lee
 Interestingly, at that time, the four ministers who assisted in removing him from the post of Chief Minister belonged to the then Samata Party, considered close to his party's senior leader Nitish Kumar
 samta party kaa aktubar 2003 main jedy (you) main vilay ho gaya tha
 Marandi says, "time has already changed
 ab aap kuen ke mechak banakar nahin rah sakate
 "the reason for being close to Marandi and Nitish is that both have become disenchanted with the Congress and the BJP
" donon netaa rashtriya partiyon se dur rahanaa chaahate hai
 Marandi parted ways with the BJP in 2006 and Nitish in 2013
 congress ne lalu prasad yadav kaa saath dene ke liye nitish ko nakaar diya he
 On the other hand, Marandi's experience of contesting the Jharkhand assembly elections in collaboration with Congress in 2009 was also not good
 party ne unhen sirf 25 sitanm hi di thim, jinamein se marandi ko 11 par jeet mili thi
 Later, the Congress left Marandi and joined hands with Shibu Soren of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)
 sorain marandi ke dhur virdohi rahe hai
 Marandi, unlike the third front which probably came into existence after the Lok Sabha elections, is trying to form the fourth front before the election
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘is gathbandhan se judi aupchaariktaayen abhi taiyaar kii jaani hai, jisamen siton kaa bantwaaraa bhi shaamil he
 "they have no advantage because there is no national agenda because the four parties will contest in their own states and there will be no conflict between each other
" chunaavon se pehle unka jor is baat par hoga ki ve apane paaramparik vot gathbandhan ke sahyogiyon ko dilaa saken
 In Jharkhand, Marandi's party JVM has two seats in the Lok Sabha and 11 seats in the assembly, it wants to strengthen its koiri-kurmi vote bank with the JD (U)
 jharkhand main jedy (you) ke do vidhayak hai
 In return Marandi will try to get tribal votes in favor of JD (U) in Bihar
 voton ke maamle main bhale hi nitish ko zyada phayda nahin hoga, lekin marandi jaise adivasee netaa ko saath laakar ve bade janaadhar vaale netaa kii apni girti chhavi ko sanvaar sakenge
 Marandi is a man with strong intentions
 bedaag or kushal shaasha kii chhavi ke baavjood ve mukhyamantri ke taur par paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa nahin kar paae
 They can get an opportunity to fulfill their unfulfilled wish this year
 saadhaaran parivaar se sambandh rakhane vaale marandi ne bhugol main grajuation kiya he
 He left the school teacher's job in 1981 because a clerk was demanding a bribe to pay him salary
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘maine sarkari naukari chhod di kyonki apana vetan paane ke liye agar main rishwat de detaa to mujhe apane atmasamman se samjhauta karnaa padataa
 i left the BJP because by staying with it i would cheat the trust of the people
 ’’marandi ne kai baar apane fauladi iraadon kaa pradarshan kiya he
 He is one of the few leaders of Jharkhand who have openly opposed the Maoists
 isiilie maovadiyon ne 2007 main giridih ke ek saanskrithik kaarykram ke dauraan hamalaa karke unke bete kii hatya kar di thi or unke bhai kisi tarah batch nikle the
 Marandi's convoy was attacked by Maoists in 2003, but they survived
 marandi 1981 main bijepi main shaamil hue the
 a decade later, he contested the Lok Sabha election against Shibu Soren from Dumka constituency
 us chunaav main marandi ko 1,34,000 voton se baari haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 In 1996, he again fought against Shibu Soren and lost this time too, but only by 6,000 votes
 1998 or 1999 main aakhirkaar ve dumka se loksabhaa chunaav jeet gaye
 In both these elections he defeated Shibu Soren first and then his wife Rupi Soren
 atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main unhen paryaavaran or van rajyamantri banaaya gaya tha
 a year later, in November 2000, when Bihar was partitioned into Jharkhand, he became the first Chief Minister of the state
 unki party main shaamil hone vaale chaar vidhayak jab 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle bijepi main laut gaye to logon ne maan liya tha ki marandi raajnneeti ke haashie par pahunch chuke hai
 But the JVM secured 11 seats in the 81-seat assembly with 28 percent votes
 ve agar sarkaar nahin bana paae to sirf isliye ki unhone kul 25 siton par chunaav ladaa tha or baaki kii 56 siten gathbandhan kii apni sahyogi party congress ke liye chhod di thim
 But the performance of the Congress was very disappointing
 marandi apane hisse kaa sabak sikh chuke hai
 After these experiences, he has prepared his plan for 2014 and he has become more careful than before

 'silenced' 
 aisa kisi ne bolaa nahin
 This was just the atmosphere
 bilkul sannata
 Rahul Gandhi was sitting on the small couch
 been bag kii bagal main laal rang kaa ek kyub stool rakhaa hua tha
 Rahul likes to keep study lamps on it often
 us vakt vahaan ek ladki baithi hui thi
 People were surprised to see the girl with Rahul
 ladki ko dekhte hi sonia chaunk gayi, 'shi!' unke munh se barabas nikal padaa
 Not only Sonia, but the other people were also surprised, that girl too
 rahul ko to pataa hi tha, aisa hi hoga
 He remained silent and quiet like this
 maujuud logon main agar koi sabase sahaj tha to wo thim priyanka
 'or
 
 
 mama, shi
 'yes, this thing of Priyanka shaking her head was more surprising
 priyanka kii is sahajata se sonia ye to samaj gayi ki baat wo nahin jo najar aa rahi he
 Sonia was staring at the girl
 bich bich main kabhi priyanka to rahul ke chehron par bhi uski najar chali jaati
 To her surprise, how did Sonia know about her? Rahul had not told anything about this to Sonia
 ladki ye baat jaanati thi
 Only Priyanka knew about him
 baat to sonia se bhi hoti rahati thi, lekin na wo puuchhatin ki rahul kahaan hai - or na hi rahul is baat kaa zikr karte
 Sonia was unaware that Lalu ji was not thinking anything better for him than what he had planned for Rahul
 sonia ko zyada der tak suspence main rakhana priyanka ko bhi acha nahin laga
 Then Priyanka said that the girl is none other than Rahul's interpreter
 sonia kii baat par hami unhone isliye bhari thi kyonki uskaa naam 'shi' he
 Xi of China origin studied in London, after which he did a diploma in sign language from America
 shi ko pehla asinment thailand main mila lekin raste main hi pataa chalaa ki client kaa trip cancel ho gaya he
 Meanwhile, Rahul's team was looking for an interpreter for him
 fasebuk ke jariye shi kaa profile dekhakar sampark saadhaa gaya - or baat pakki ho gai
 Rahul was sitting quietly like that
 chehre par gusse kaa bhav bilkul na tha
 Even torn paper or pieces of it were not seen around
 aage kii kahani shi ne sunai, jinamein se kuch baaten sonia bhi jaanati thim
 Rahul Gandhi wanted to go to political study leave, but not out of the country
 unhen ek aisi jagah kii talash thi jahaan kudarti maahaul ho
 May you be at peace iske liye jaruri tha ki aas paas jo log hon ve bhi like minded hon
 Some made a Center for Naturopathy in Bangalore and some Center in Hyderabad
 ek ne to haridwar kaa patanjali yoga peeth bhi sujhaayaa
 Everyone was rejected
 aatmamanthan ke liye kisi ne vipashyana kii salaah di, lekin wo course 10 din main hi khatm ho jaataa he isliye wo auto-riject ho gaya
 Lalu Yadav was also sitting in this consultation meeting
 lalu ne bihar kii munger yoga peeth kaa naam sujhaayaa - or fouran hi wo final ho gaya
 In Munger Yoga Peeth, Rahul practiced a lot of 'silent fast'
 isamen unhen khub majaa aane laga
 Then he understood the need for a person who could give his silent dialogues to others
 phir rahul ko sin language seekhney kii salaah di gai
 It was difficult to learn it while living in the country because there was a possibility of disturbing it
 bich bich main rahul bhi ishaaron se apni baat rakhte rahe
 She kept giving words to Rahul's sentiments, 'this is because it is Mama's favorite
 ''mama, din ke baad raat - or raat ke baad din kaa chakra chalata he
 This is the law of nature
 raajnneeti main bhi yahi niyam lagu hota he
 After a silent Prime Minister, the country has got a speaking PM
 ab ek baar phir khamosh piem kii baari he
 So that this continuous process of political creation goes on
 ''khamoshi main sthaitv he, mama
 Silence falls on a thousand words
 'hazaron javaabon se acchhee he meri khamoshi, na jane kitne sawaalon kii aabru rakhi'
 Hearing this, how did you laugh, Mama
 aakhir aisa kitni baar hua he, jab tum jor se hans pai ho
 "mamma, whatever you say i will do
" lekin chup rahoonga
 If i could make you happy then it would be the greatest happiness for me
 ' rahul ke ishaaron par sonia ko shi ne samajhaayaa
 Sonia was very worried
 unke chehre par tanaav badhata ja rahaa tha
 Seeing this, Priyanka also became a little serious
 phir shi ne ek aisi baat bataai jise sunakar sabhi ke chehron ke bhav badal gaye
 Rahul ji has decided to keep silence fast only one day a week
 lekin iske liye unhen mama kii manjuuri chahie hogi
 Sonia became completely comfortable on hearing this, so did Priyanka
 tabhi aakar kisi ne bataay digvijay ji aae hue hai, milanaa chaahate hai
 Everyone stood up
 rahul kaa ishaara paakar shi bhi unke saath ho lee
 Actually, Digvijay ji is also said to be an expert in sign language
 shi kaa kaam wo bhi kar sakate the, lekin phir baaki kaam kaise hote? On the issue of hearing in Kulbhushan Jadhav International Court, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that India will get success in Kulbhushan Yadav's case
 gauratlab he ki aaj se antarrashtriya adaalat main kulbhushan yadav ke mudde par sunwaayee ho rahi he
 About this, Attorney General of India Mukul Rohatgi said, 'india's case is good
 pakistan ne sabhi antarrashtriya samjhauton kaa ulanghan kiya he
 They have also violated the Vienna Treaty
 yah saaf he ki is cese main unke paas koi evidence nahin he
 There is no power in the case which has been tried
 trial military adaalat main hua jo public ke liye band tha
 It automatically shows that there is fraud in it
 hamen puri ummid he, hamaari puri taiyaari he
 India will get success in this case
 pakistan ke is bayaan par ki antarrashtriya adaalat kaa faislamilitary court permaanya nahin he, is par mukul rohtagi kaa kahana he ki pakistan kii yah baat galat he
 Pakistan and India have the Vienna Treaty which both of them have signed
 is sandhi ke tahat counslar acces deni chahie thi
 i think we should have complete success
 koi samjhauta puure mulk par lagu hota he to uske adaalat par bhi lagu hoga
 There is no difference
 mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki bharat ko puri ummid he ki kulbhushan jadhav ko pakistan kii kaid se chhudaa liya jayega
 He said, 'I also hope that due to international pressure, Pakistan should understand that this work is wrong
 vah jadhav ko khud hi chhod de
 This would be good for friendly relations of both countries
 pakistan kii baat galat he, yah khud hi pakistan ko agar samaj aa jaae to acha hoga donon deshon ke relations ke liye
 'on the issue of joining Pakistan's international court, the Attorney General says that Pakistan will definitely be involved in it, but Pakistan must be sure that its decision will not be implemented above its military court
 mudda yahi rahegaa ki hamaare khilaaf aap dyside nahin kar sakate
 We do not believe it
 lekin court ko haq he usko riject karnaa or yah kahana ki vah jo faisla karata he vah donon deshon par lagu hoga
 Significantly, the international court has stayed the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav
 lekin pakistan ne isko maanane se inkaar kar diya he
 He says that the decision of the international court is not valid on the military court of Pakistan
 ab is maamle par antarrashtriya adaalat main sunwaayee ho rahi he
 India is repeatedly appealing that Pakistan has violated the Vienna Treaty
 thane par firing karte hue papala ko chhudaa le gaye the badmashpulice or aropiyon ke bich chal rahi thi saudebajirajasthan ke bahrod main papala gurjar ko thane se chhudaae jane ke cese main police ne do logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Police have also seized cash from the accused
 haalanki, dilachasp baat ye he ki ye giraftaaryaan soshal media par police kii majaak udne ke baad hui hai
 Actually, the infamous crook Papala Gurjar was arrested by the Behror Police and kept in lockup
 uski gaadi se 32 lakh rupye bhi jabt kiye gaye the
 It is claimed that Vinod Swami and Kailash Gurjar, sarpanches of Bahrod, reached the police station to rescue Papala Gurjar and informed Kuldeep Gang about the police station
 iske baad eke-47 lekar aae badmaash thane par firing karte hue papala ko chhudaa le gaye
 The incident raised questions on the police of Behror
 yahaan tak ki soshal media par police kaa majaak udaaya jane laga
 After this whole incident, SHO Sugan Singh of Bahrod Road police station wrote on social media that he is neither corrupt nor worthless
 unhone safai main kaha ki pistal jam ho gai thi
 He fired four times, but did not fire
 har taraf majaak udne ke baad police ne ab do aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 Police arrested Vinod Swami and Kailash Gurjar, sarpanches of Bahrod
 saath hi inke paas se cash bhi jabt kiya gaya he
 However, allegations are also being made that bargaining was going on between the police and the accused to distribute the cash recovered from the vehicle of Papala Gurjar
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ye deal nahin ho pai or har taraf police kaa majaak udne ke baad police ne is maamle main giraftaaryaan kin
 After continuous dramatic developments in Karnataka, Governor Vajubhai Vala on Thursday asked bjp's BS Yeddyurappa to take oath as Chief Minister
 iske baad ab sabhi kii nazren vidhansabha main hone vaale floor test par tik gai hai
 Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala has given the BJP leader 15 days to prove his majority in the House
 isi bich aar aar nagar kii vidhansabha seat par bhi chunaav karaae jaaenge jahaan par 12 may ko matdaan nahin ho sakaa tha
 If the counting of votes is completed in the meantime, the BJP will have to touch 113 to prove its majority
 haalanki, duusari vidhansabha seat jayanagar ke liye chunaav kii taarikh kaa elaan abhi nahin kiya gaya he
 The test before the floor test is now more important than the floor test to be held in the house
 nae vidhansabha spikar kaa chunaav or unke vivek par kaaphi kuch tay karegaa
 Both BJP and jds-congress camps have begun to consult on the issue of the next speaker as the role of the speaker will be crucial in the first floor test
 duusari taraf, bijepi ke liye yah bahut jaruri ho gaya he ki spikar uski pasand kaa ho
 The BJP hopes that either some of the opposition mlas will resign or will join the BJP
 is tarah se bijepi kaa bahumat se 8 siton kaa faasla khatm ho jayega
 Now starts from here, the real exam of CM Yeddyurappa started with the preparation of the oath of the BJP members, as well as the strategy for the election of the new speaker
 jedies-congress spikar ke pad ke liye apana ek ummidavaar khadaa karegaa
 The congress-jds, with 116 members, will outnumber bjp's 104 in terms of voting strength
 kitni ahm he spikar kii bhoomika?spikar ke chunaav par vipakshi partiyaan ekamat ho sakati hai lekin vartmaan paristhiti main aisa hone kii sambhaavna najar nahin aa rahi he
 The Protem Speaker cannot conduct a floor test, the Protem Speaker is appointed to administer the oath to the new mlas
 floor test chune gaye spikar hi karaate hai
 The speaker also has an important role in hearing complaints under the 'anti Defection Law'
 kai maamalon main vidhayak apni party ke vip ke khilaaf jaakar vot karte hai lekin spikar ko turant faisla dene kii anivaaryta nahin hoti he
 There have been instances before that where the speaker did not take immediate action on the matter
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha spikar keshari nath treepathi, andhra pradesh or telugana ke spikaron ne maamle ko latakaae rakhaa
 Since the speaker is not kept within a time limit to pass judgment on the matter, the ruling party can remain in power for several months
 karnataka vidhansabha ke maujuuda spikar ke bi coliwad ne rajyasabha main voting ke dauraan jedies ke 7 vidhayakon ko ayogy qaraar nahin diya tha jinhone congress ummidavaar ke paksh main cross vot kiya tha
 a BJP leader said, even the High Court says that these mlas should be disqualified but the speaker kept sitting on the matter
 bijepi or congress-jedies donon khemon ne rajyapal ko sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne ke saath aadhikarik patr saunp diya he
 a senior Congress leader said, after all, the election of the speaker will be the most decisive one who will monitor the trust vote
 spikar kaa chunaav apane aap main hi ek tarah kaa floor test he
 BJP believes the same
 party ke ek netaa ne bataaya, ham is mudde par charchaa kar rahe hai ki ham kise spikar banaae jise sahi or nishpaksh shaks ke taur par dekha jaae
 Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has also reacted to the NRC issue in Assam
 unhone sarkaar kaa naam liye bina enarasi ke mudde kaa uthaaya he
 Shashi Tharoor said that Rabindranath Tagore had said that there is a difference between nationalism and not liking foreign people
 vahiin videsh logon se nafrat dhire-dhire bharatiyon se nafrat main badal jaati he
 "there is a thin line between nationalism and xenophobia — besides, hatred of the foreigner could later turn into a hatred of Indians different from oneself
 " -- Rabindranath Tagore
 The prescience of a great man! # NRC — Shashi Tharoor (@shashitharoor) August 31, 2019 Shashi Tharoor said this at a time when the final list of NRC has been released in Assam
 assam kii rashtriya naagarikta register (enarasi) kii antim suchi shanivaar ko jari kar di gai, jisamen se lagbhag 19 lakh logon ke nikaal diya gaya
 19,06,677 people have been removed from the final list
 suchi main 3,11,21,004 logon ko bhartiya naagarik bataaya gaya he
 At the same time, after the release of the NRC data, the Congress is meeting at 10 Janpath, the residence of interim president Sonia Gandhi
 congress is mudde par sarkaar ko gherne kii puri koshish karegi
 Therefore, a strategy can also be chalked out in this meeting
 is baithak main party ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad or gaurav gogoi bhi shaamil hai
 However, for the 19 lakh people who have not got a place in the NRC list, there is still a chance
 in logon ko forenurs tribulan main 120 dinon main apil kerani padegi
 The Government of Assam will establish 400 Foreigners Tribunals to look into matters related to those removed from the final list of the National Citizenship Register (NRC) in the state

 Match fixing seems to be overshadowed by the ongoing T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar ai he ki colombo main 200 se zyada fiksar maujuud hai

 Cricketers from any country are forbidden to meet unknown people

 Fixing and cricket have been an old relationship and the ICC has taken measures to deal with it step by step, but the genie of fixing is visible in every important tournament
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne ravindra jadeja par jurmaana lagane ke isisi ke faisle kii kadi aalochana karte hue shanivaar ko kaha ki is maamle main kai chizon par dhyaan nahin diya gaya or yadi unke khilaadiyon se durvyavhaar hota he to ve use nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate
 Jadeja was found guilty of committing sportsmanship against England pacer James Anderson at Trentbridge for an incident that resulted in him being fined 50 per cent of the match fees
 dhoni ne england ke khilaaf tisare test match kii purv sandhya par kaha, 'nijee taur par yah mere liye behad aahat karne vaala faisla tha
 While deciding in this matter many things were not taken into consideration
 ' The Indian captain also told about the incident at Trentbridge
 unhone kaha, 'yadi aap dekho ki vastav main kya hua, to ampiron ne lunch kii ghoshnaa kii or ham pavilion kii taraf jane lage
 i do not want to name any other player
 ham ja rahe the or anya khilaadi ne jadeja ke khilaaf apshabdon kaa upyog karnaa shuru kar diya
 When we reached the boundary line, i thought that the situation had become stable
 ' Dhoni said, "when we reached the players' field, i was ahead of Jadeja
 vah mere se thodaa peeche tha
 Then something happened
 uske liye kuch kaha gaya or phir se use dhakka de diya gaya
 He barely managed to balance himself
 vah yah dekhne ke liye peeche muda ki kya ho rahaa he or is aadhaar par us par jurmaana laga diya gaya
 ' bhartiya captain ne kaha, 'mujhe nahin lagata ki jadeja ne thodaa bhi gussa dikhaaya gaya hoga or isliye main faisle se kaaphi aahat hum
 ' isisi ne jadeja ko level ek ke tahat doshi paaya or dhoni ise bhi hasyaspad maanate hai
 He said, 'the charges were leveled at level two and Jadeja got punishment for level one
 level ek kii khaasiyat yah he ki aap uske khilaaf apil nahin kar sakate, lekin bisisiai or kanoonee team is par kaam kar rahe hai
 We are certainly not happy with the decision
 sachaai kya he maine bataa di he
 ' dhoni ne kaha, 'yadi kal main apane khilaadiyon se kahata hum ki maidan par kuch bhi nahin kahen, to yah phir is tarah se hoga ki jo kuch bhi hoga uskaa ham par match fees kaa 50 pratishat jurmaana lagegaa
 That is why i can also use abusive words because you have to lose 50 percent match fee even if other player says abusive words for you
 ' The Indian captain also said that he had told the BCCI that he definitely wanted him to appeal against the decision

 In Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party is moving towards a big loss
 jahaan aalaa netaaon ko 20 siton par chunaav kii chintaa sata rahi he to party ke anya vidhayak mantri pad yaa vidhayak kii ajeeb paribhaasha tay karne main jute gaye hai
 Somnath Bharti, who was the law minister in the Kejriwal government during the 49-day government, says that 'AAP' is not getting gold by becoming a minister, legislator or parliamentary secretary
 hycortmen 20 vidhayakon ko kanoonee samarthan dene pahunche somnath bharti se jab poocha gaya ki kya unhen dilli sarkaar main dobaaraa kanoon mantri kii zimmedaari mil sakati he
 In response to this, Bharti was seen giving interesting answers
 unhone kaha ki, "party jis vidhayak ko daayitv detii he use nibhaayaa jaataa he
 i have come to stand with my colleagues in the High Court
 vakil hone ke naate daayitv banataa he ki party ko jab bhi kanoonee ladaai yaa salaah kii zarurat ho to vahaan main khadaa rahun
 "let us tell you, a minister is also among the 20 mlas who lost the membership
 zimmedaari ke sawaal par somnath bharti aage kehete hai ki, "is party main bhaiya, na mantri banakar sona mil rahaa he or na sansadeey sachiv banakar sona mil rahaa he or na vidhayak banakar sona mil rahaa he
 In the Aam Aadmi Party one has to work erratically
 is party main koi vidhayak yaa saansad kaa sapana nahin dekhtaa
 This blinding occurs in BJP and Congress
 aam aadmi party main chakachaundh nahin he
 "however, being a lawyer himself, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Somnath Bharti is confident that he will get relief from the court
 bharti kaa kahana he ki 'nyaay ke liye hycourt, dabl bench or phir supreme court kaa rukh karenge
 The Aam Aadmi Party is confident that the Supreme Court or the High Court will not ignore the actions of the Election Commission
 pichley 3 saal se sun rahe hai ki dilli sarkaar kaa order tab tak maanya nahin hoga jabatak alji sahab sin na kar den
 LG Sahab did not sign on the order of the Parliamentary Secretary
 "somnath bharti se jab niyuktiyon karne ke baad kanoon banane kaa sawaal poocha, to wo yah daawa kar baithe ki 20 vidhayakon ko kabhi sansadeey sachiv niyukt kiya hi nahin gaya
 According to Bharti, 20 mlas were disqualified by making a case on half-incomplete order
 somnath bharatise pad kaa laabh lene par sawaal poocha to unhone kaha ki "na gaadi lee, na bangala, na daphtar or na ek pen liya he to profit kaise hua
 Inside the Assembly, the Speaker had spent the maintenance, which is his right
 aadhikarik taur par vidhayakon ko koi daphtar nahin mila tha, lekin mej or kursi ko agar daphtar kehete hai jiske istemaal se janata ke liye kaam kiya jaae to isamen haani kya he
 "aam Aadmi Party MLA Somnath Bharti believes that the High Court is a constitutional body and the institution is expected to get justice because the appointment of Parliamentary Secretary was stayed by the High Court

 donon main se kisi ko bhartiya rupee ke ludhakne par likhnaa chahie or bataanaa chahie ki 2013 main sansad main jo unhone bhaashan diya tha, vahi baat kar rahe hai yaa usase alag baat kar rahe hai or unka jawaab manmohan singh ke jawaab se kyon alag he
 The price of one dollar has crossed Rs 69 and it is being talked about going to Rs 71
 jabaki modi ke aane se 40 rupee tak le aane kaa khwaab dikhaaya ja rahaa tha
 Keep an eye on the news about Iran's ban on Iran
 kya bharat apni urja zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke liye swatantra raah par chalegaa yaa america jidhar haankega udhar jayega? times of india kii heading he ki nikki hele sakht zabaan main bol rahi hai ki iran se aayaat band karnaa padegaa
 Nikki Helle is the US Ambassador to the United Nations and is visiting India
 america chahta he ki bharat iran se tel kaa aayaat shunya par laae
 When Iran was banned during Obama's tenure, India was reducing imports by 20 percent within six months, but now Trump wants to be completely stopped at one go
 indian express main tel mantri dharmendra pradhan kaa bayaan chapa he
 Consider this statement, which i have translated from Express
 aisa lagata he ki tel mantri hi videsh mantri hai or inhone trump ko do took jawaab de diya he
 If this is the case then the Prime Minister or Foreign Minister should be formalized so that the public knows what is India's policy regarding the Iran ban
 "pichley do saal main bharat kii sthiti itani majboot ho chuki he ki koi bhi tel utpaadak desh hamaari zaruuraton or ummiido ko nazarandaaz nahin kar saktaa he
 For me, my interest is paramount and from where i want, i will buy crude oil according to my geo-political situation and my needs
 ham jahaan se chahenge vahaan se kaccha tel khreedenge
 " ye bayaan he dharmendra pradhan kaa
 You should laugh agar do saal main bharat kii sthiti majboot ho gai he to bharat saaf-saaf kyon nahin kah detaa he
 Whereas in the same express, a column has been reported next to the same statement that oil refineries have been asked to start looking for alternatives
 unhen ye baat tel mantralay ne hi kahi he jiske mantri dharmendra pradhan hai
 In the news quoting the sources, it is written that they should start preparations because the import of oil may be greatly reduced or it should be stopped altogether
 iske barakes aap mantri kaa bayaan dekhie
 It should be clearly said that we will do what America says and we have been doing the same
 isamen 56 eench kii koi baat hi nahin he
 You can fool people by doing politics at the cost of rupees, they will be made and even made, but it can not stop its fall
 vaise hi trump ko sidhe-sidhe manaa nahin kar sakate
 Sure, India has increased the duty on things being imported from America, but this list does not have the motorcycle on which the Prime Minister himself had informed Trump about the reduction of import duty
 ab aap politics samaj paa rahe hai, propeganda dekh paa rahe hai? Nidhi Verma's news has appeared on page six of the Business Standard that India has agreed to zero oil imports from Iran
 aap hi bataaiye kya itani badi khabar bheetar ke pej par honi chahie thi? is khabar main likhaa he ki tel mantralay ne rifineriyon ko kaha he ki vaikalpik intazaam shuru kar den
 This is the first sign that the Government of India has begun to act on the whims of America
 bharat kah chukaa he ki vah kisi desh kii taraf se iktarafa pratibandh ko manyata nahin detaa he
 It follows the UN ban
 lekin jab yah kaha he to phir is baat ko tab kyon nahin doharaaya ja rahaa he jab nikki heli dilli aakar saaf saaf kah rahi hai ki iran se aayaat ko shunya karnaa padegaa

 The government should tell whose and how much money is this? If there is no black money, then in the legal way also the Indian rich are not keeping their money in Indian banks now? Is their trust weakening? In 2015, the government passed a strict law in the Lok Sabha under which it was said to be difficult to keep money outside without knowing
 jurmaana ke saath saath 6 maheene se lekar 7 saal ke jail kii sazaa kaa praavdhaan tha
 The Finance Minister should report what progress was made after this law was enacted or whether this law was created to increase the burden on paper
 is vakt do-do vitt mantri hai
 Either of the two should write on the Indian rupee depreciation and state that the speech he gave in Parliament in 2013 is speaking or talking differently and why his answer is different from Manmohan Singh's answer
 ek dollar kii keemat 69 rupee paar kar gai or iske 71 rupee tak jane kii baat ho rahi he
 While the dream of bringing up to 40 rupees was being shown with the arrival of Modi
 iran par amareeki pratibandh ko lekar chap rahi khabaron par nazar rakhie
 Will India go on an independent path to meet its energy needs or will America go wherever it is? The Times of India is heading that Nikki Helle is speaking out in stern language that imports from Iran will have to be stopped
 nikki hele sanyukt raashtra main amareeki rajdoot hai or bharat kii yatra par hai
 America wants India to bring oil imports from Iran to zero
 obama ke kaarykaal main jab iran par pratibandh laga tha tab bharat chah maheene ke bheetar 20 pratishat aayaat kam kar rahaa tha magar ab trump chaahate hai ki ek hi baar main puraa band kar diya jaae
 The statement of Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan is printed in the Indian Express
 aap is bayaan par gaur kiijie jiskaa maine express se lekar anuwaad kiya he
 It seems that the oil minister is the foreign minister and he has given a sharp reply to Trump
 agar aisa he to pradhanmantri yaa videsh mantri ko aupchaarik rup de dena chahie taaki janata ko pataa chale ki iran pratibandh ko lekar bharat kii kya niti he
 "india's position has become so strong in the last two years that no oil producing country can ignore our needs and expectations
 mere liye meraa hit hi sarvopari he or main jahaan se chaahunga vahiin se bhu-raajnneetik sthiti or apni zaruuraton ke hisaab se kaccha tel khridoongaa
 We will buy crude oil from where we want
 " This statement is of Dharmendra Pradhan
 aapako hansi aani chahie
 If India has become stronger in two years, then why does India not say clearly
 jabaki isi express main isi bayaan ke bagal main ek kollam kii khabar lagi he ki tel rifineriyon ko kaha gaya he ki ve vikalp kii talash shuru kar den
 He was told this by the Oil Ministry, whose minister is Dharmendra Pradhan
 sutron ke hawaale se is khabar main likhaa he ki taiyaari shuru kar den kyonki ho saktaa he ki tel kaa aayaat bahut kam kiya jaae yaa phir ekadam band kar diya jaae
 See the statement of the minister against this
 saaf-saaf kahana chahie ki jo america kahegaa ham vahi karenge or ham vahi karte rahe hai
 There is no question of 56 inches in it
 aap rupee kii keemat par politics kar logon ko murkh bana sakate hai, bana liya or bana bhi lenge lekin uskaa girnaa thode na roak sakate hai
 In the same way, Trump cannot be denied directly
 zarur bharat ne america se aayaat kii ja rahi chizon par shulk badhaayaa he magar is suchi main wo motorcycle nahin he jis par aayaat shulk ghataane kii soochna khud pradhanmantri ne trump ko di thi
 Now you can understand politics, see propaganda? bijness standard ke pej chah par nidhi verma kii khabar chhapi he ki bharat iran se tel aayaat ko shunya karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 You tell me, should there be such a big news on the inside page? It is written in this news that the oil ministry has asked the refineries to start alternative arrangements
 yah pehla sanket he ki bharat sarkaar america kii ghudki par harakat karne lagi he
 India has said that it does not recognize unilateral sanctions on behalf of any country
 vah sanyukt raashtra ke pratibandh kaa hi anusaran karata he
 But when this is said, then why is this thing not being repeated when Nikki Haley comes to Delhi and is clearly saying that imports from Iran will have to be zeroed

 We will buy crude oil from where we want
 " This statement is of Dharmendra Pradhan
 aapako hansi aani chahie
 If India has become stronger in two years, then why does India not say clearly
 jabaki isi express main isi bayaan ke bagal main ek kollam kii khabar lagi he ki tel rifineriyon ko kaha gaya he ki ve vikalp kii talash shuru kar den
 He was told this by the Oil Ministry, whose minister is Dharmendra Pradhan
 sutron ke hawaale se is khabar main likhaa he ki taiyaari shuru kar den kyonki ho saktaa he ki tel kaa aayaat bahut kam kiya jaae yaa phir ekadam band kar diya jaae

 aap rupee kii keemat par politics kar logon ko murkh bana sakate hai, bana liya or bana bhi lenge lekin uskaa girnaa thode na roak sakate hai
 In the same way, Trump cannot be denied directly
 zarur bharat ne america se aayaat kii ja rahi chizon par shulk badhaayaa he magar is suchi main wo motorcycle nahin he jis par aayaat shulk ghataane kii soochna khud pradhanmantri ne trump ko di thi
 Now you can understand politics, see propaganda? bijness standard ke pej chah par nidhi verma kii khabar chhapi he ki bharat iran se tel aayaat ko shunya karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 You tell me, should there be such a big news on the inside page? It is written in this news that the oil ministry has asked the refineries to start alternative arrangements
 yah pehla sanket he ki bharat sarkaar america kii ghudki par harakat karne lagi he
 India has said that it does not recognize unilateral sanctions on behalf of any country
 vah sanyukt raashtra ke pratibandh kaa hi anusaran karata he
 But when this is said, then why is this thing not being repeated when Nikki Haley comes to Delhi and is clearly saying that imports from Iran will have to be zeroed
 hindi akhabaaron main ye sab jaankaree nahin milegi
 i bring it to you with hard work so that you can understand the world by reading them
 zaruri nahin ki aap bhakt se no bhakt ban jaaen magar jaan kar bhakt bane rahanaa acha he, kam se kam afsos to nahin hoga ki dhokhaa kha gaye
 Now see, the original questions are not discussed, so some leader of the government or the BJP, uproots the issues of history
 wo bhi galat salat
 To run the politics of tu tu main main
 har din aap channel khol kar khud se dekh len, pataa chalegaa ki desh kahaan ja rahaa he
 Leaders who do not have time to read and solve the problems of the public, are suddenly making such statements as soon as they wake up in the morning, they finish a book of history
 usamen bhi galat bol dete hai
 Now see Prime Minister Maghar to celebrate the birth anniversary of Kabir
 vahaan bhaashan kya diya
 How much Kabir gave and how much Mayawati gave to Akhilesh, you will know what Kabir means for him

 indian express main tel mantri dharmendra pradhan kaa bayaan chapa he
 Consider this statement, which i have translated from Express
 aisa lagata he ki tel mantri hi videsh mantri hai or inhone trump ko do took jawaab de diya he
 If this is the case then the Prime Minister or Foreign Minister should be formalized so that the public knows what is India's policy regarding the Iran ban
 "pichley do saal main bharat kii sthiti itani majboot ho chuki he ki koi bhi tel utpaadak desh hamaari zaruuraton or ummiido ko nazarandaaz nahin kar saktaa he
 For me, my interest is paramount and from where i want, i will buy crude oil according to my geo-political situation and my needs
 ham jahaan se chahenge vahaan se kaccha tel khreedenge
 " ye bayaan he dharmendra pradhan kaa
 You should laugh agar do saal main bharat kii sthiti majboot ho gai he to bharat saaf-saaf kyon nahin kah detaa he
 Whereas in the same express, a column has been reported next to the same statement that oil refineries have been asked to start looking for alternatives
 unhen ye baat tel mantralay ne hi kahi he jiske mantri dharmendra pradhan hai
 In the news quoting the sources, it is written that they should start preparations because the import of oil may be greatly reduced or it should be stopped altogether
 iske barakes aap mantri kaa bayaan dekhie
 It should be clearly said that we will do what America says and we have been doing the same
 isamen 56 eench kii koi baat hi nahin he
 You can fool people by doing politics at the cost of rupees, they will be made and even made, but it can not stop its fall
 vaise hi trump ko sidhe-sidhe manaa nahin kar sakate
 Sure, India has increased the duty on things being imported from America, but this list does not have the motorcycle on which the Prime Minister himself had informed Trump about the reduction of import duty
 ab aap politics samaj paa rahe hai, propeganda dekh paa rahe hai? Nidhi Verma's news has appeared on page six of the Business Standard that India has agreed to zero oil imports from Iran
 aap hi bataaiye kya itani badi khabar bheetar ke pej par honi chahie thi? is khabar main likhaa he ki tel mantralay ne rifineriyon ko kaha he ki vaikalpik intazaam shuru kar den
 This is the first sign that the Government of India has begun to act on the whims of America
 bharat kah chukaa he ki vah kisi desh kii taraf se iktarafa pratibandh ko manyata nahin detaa he
 It follows the UN ban
 lekin jab yah kaha he to phir is baat ko tab kyon nahin doharaaya ja rahaa he jab nikki heli dilli aakar saaf saaf kah rahi hai ki iran se aayaat ko shunya karnaa padegaa
 All this information will not be found in Hindi newspapers

 It is not necessary that you become a devotee from a devotee, but knowing that it is good to remain a devotee, at least you will not regret having been cheated
 ab dekhie, mul sawaalon par charchaa na ho isliye sarkaar yaa bhaajapa kaa koi na koi netaa itihaas ke gade murde ukhaad laata he
 That too wrong salat
 tu tu main main kii politics chalaane ke liye
 Every day you open the channel and see for yourself, you will know where the country is going
 jin netaaon ke paas janata kii samasya padhane or niraakaran kaa vakt nahin he, wo achaanak aise bayaan de rahe hai jaise subah subah uthte hi itihaas kii ek kitaab khatm kar lete hai
 They also speak wrong in that
 ab dekhie pradhanmantri magahar gaye kabir kii jayanti manaane
 What did he deliver there
 kitna kabir par diya or kitna mayawati akhilesh par diya, isse aapako pataa chalegaa ki unke liye kabir kaa kya matlab he
 When his own party has criticized Rahul Gandhi's politics of going to Mazar temple, it should not have gone so soon
 jab gaye to galat salat to nahin bolnaa tha
 In Maghar, the Prime Minister said that "it is here that Saint Kabir, Guru Nanak Dev Ji and Guru Gorakhnath used to sit together and have spiritual discussions" while the three were born in different centuries
 karnataka main isi tarah bhagat singh ko lekar jhooth bol aae ki koi unase milane nahin gaya
 Think, when the Prime Minister does so much work, where does he have the time to give a speech every other day
 aap unke kaam, yatraaon or bhaashan or bhaashanon main galat salat tathyon ko trek kiijie, aapako dukh hoga ki jis netaa ko janata itnaa pyaar karti he, wo netaa itnaa jhooth kyon bolta he
 What is helplessness, is nothing really done? tippaniyan Not today, not tomorrow, only after sixty years, if asked correctly
 kabir, nanak or gorakhnath ko lekar galat bolne kii kya zarurat he
 Does the public become stupid by lying and lying? Does Modi, who talks of making India a world guru, want to fool India? Disclaimer (disclaimer): The views expressed in this article are the personal views of the author

 "india's position has become so strong in the last two years that no oil producing country can ignore our needs and expectations
 mere liye meraa hit hi sarvopari he or main jahaan se chaahunga vahiin se bhu-raajnneetik sthiti or apni zaruuraton ke hisaab se kaccha tel khridoongaa
 We will buy crude oil from where we want
 " This statement is of Dharmendra Pradhan
 aapako hansi aani chahie
 If India has become stronger in two years, then why does India not say clearly
 jabaki isi express main isi bayaan ke bagal main ek kollam kii khabar lagi he ki tel rifineriyon ko kaha gaya he ki ve vikalp kii talash shuru kar den
 He was told this by the Oil Ministry, whose minister is Dharmendra Pradhan
 sutron ke hawaale se is khabar main likhaa he ki taiyaari shuru kar den kyonki ho saktaa he ki tel kaa aayaat bahut kam kiya jaae yaa phir ekadam band kar diya jaae
 See the statement of the minister against this
 saaf-saaf kahana chahie ki jo america kahegaa ham vahi karenge or ham vahi karte rahe hai
 There is no question of 56 inches in it
 aap rupee kii keemat par politics kar logon ko murkh bana sakate hai, bana liya or bana bhi lenge lekin uskaa girnaa thode na roak sakate hai
 In the same way, Trump cannot be denied directly
 zarur bharat ne america se aayaat kii ja rahi chizon par shulk badhaayaa he magar is suchi main wo motorcycle nahin he jis par aayaat shulk ghataane kii soochna khud pradhanmantri ne trump ko di thi
 Now you can understand politics, see propaganda? bijness standard ke pej chah par nidhi verma kii khabar chhapi he ki bharat iran se tel aayaat ko shunya karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 You tell me, should there be such a big news on the inside page? It is written in this news that the oil ministry has asked the refineries to start alternative arrangements
 yah pehla sanket he ki bharat sarkaar america kii ghudki par harakat karne lagi he
 India has said that it does not recognize unilateral sanctions on behalf of any country
 vah sanyukt raashtra ke pratibandh kaa hi anusaran karata he
 But when this is said, then why is this thing not being repeated when Nikki Haley comes to Delhi and is clearly saying that imports from Iran will have to be zeroed
 hindi akhabaaron main ye sab jaankaree nahin milegi
 i bring it to you with hard work so that you can understand the world by reading them
 zaruri nahin ki aap bhakt se no bhakt ban jaaen magar jaan kar bhakt bane rahanaa acha he, kam se kam afsos to nahin hoga ki dhokhaa kha gaye
 Now see, the original questions are not discussed, so some leader of the government or the BJP, uproots the issues of history
 wo bhi galat salat
 To run the politics of tu tu main main
 har din aap channel khol kar khud se dekh len, pataa chalegaa ki desh kahaan ja rahaa he
 Leaders who do not have time to read and solve the problems of the public, are suddenly making such statements as soon as they wake up in the morning, they finish a book of history
 usamen bhi galat bol dete hai
 Now see Prime Minister Maghar to celebrate the birth anniversary of Kabir
 vahaan bhaashan kya diya
 How much Kabir gave and how much Mayawati gave to Akhilesh, you will know what Kabir means for him

 mehnat se aap tak laata hum taaki aap inhen padhate hue desh duniya ko samaj saken
 It is not necessary that you become a devotee from a devotee, but knowing that it is good to remain a devotee, at least you will not regret having been cheated
 ab dekhie, mul sawaalon par charchaa na ho isliye sarkaar yaa bhaajapa kaa koi na koi netaa itihaas ke gade murde ukhaad laata he
 That too wrong salat
 tu tu main main kii politics chalaane ke liye
 Every day you open the channel and see for yourself, you will know where the country is going
 jin netaaon ke paas janata kii samasya padhane or niraakaran kaa vakt nahin he, wo achaanak aise bayaan de rahe hai jaise subah subah uthte hi itihaas kii ek kitaab khatm kar lete hai
 They also speak wrong in that
 ab dekhie pradhanmantri magahar gaye kabir kii jayanti manaane
 What did he deliver there
 kitna kabir par diya or kitna mayawati akhilesh par diya, isse aapako pataa chalegaa ki unke liye kabir kaa kya matlab he

 Now see, the original questions are not discussed, so some leader of the government or the BJP, uproots the issues of history
 wo bhi galat salat
 To run the politics of tu tu main main
 har din aap channel khol kar khud se dekh len, pataa chalegaa ki desh kahaan ja rahaa he
 Leaders who do not have time to read and solve the problems of the public, are suddenly making such statements as soon as they wake up in the morning, they finish a book of history
 usamen bhi galat bol dete hai
 Now see Prime Minister Maghar to celebrate the birth anniversary of Kabir
 vahaan bhaashan kya diya
 How much Kabir gave and how much Mayawati gave to Akhilesh, you will know what Kabir means for him
 jab khud unki party mazaar mandir jane kii rahul gandhi kii raajnneeti kii aalochana kar chuki he to itani jaldi to nahin janaa chahie tha
 When you went, you did not have to say the wrong thing
 magahar main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki "aisa kehete hai ki yaheen par sant kabir, guru nanak dev ji or guru gorakhnath ek saath baithkar aadhyatmik charchaa karte the" jabaki teenon alag-alag sadi main paidaa hue
 Similarly, in Karnataka, Bhagat Singh lied that no one went to meet him
 aap sochie, jab pradhanmantri itnaa kaam karte hai, to unke paas har duusare din bhaashan dene kaa vakt kahaan se aata he
 You track the wrong facts in their work, travels and speeches and speeches, you will be sad that the leader whom the public loves so much, why does that leader lie so much
 kya majaburi he, kya kaam vaaki kuch nahin hua he
 The comments aaj nahin, kal nahin, saath saal baad hi sahi, puuchhenge to sahi
 What is wrong about Kabir, Nanak and Gorakhnath? kya galat or jhooth bolne se hi janata bevakoof banati he? kya bharat ko vishwa guru banane kii baat karne vaale modi bharat ko bevakoof bananaa chaahate hai?disclemur (asveekaran) : is aalekh main vyakt kiye gaye vichaar lekhak ke nijee vichaar hai

 Salman Khan's show Bigg Boss dropped out of the top 10 on the TRP charts in the initial weeks
 haalanki ab sho ne kuch raftaar pakadi he
 Unlike the previous season of Bigg Boss, this time the show is running according to completely new rules
 sho kaa pehla phinale chaar hafte baad hi hone ja rahaa he yani phinale se pehle hi kai contestant baahar ho jaaeenge or unki jagah nae contestant ko sho kaa hissaa banane kaa mauka milegaa
 This time the biggest thing about Bigg Boss is the content and atmosphere of the show
 big bossijan 13 main sho kaa maahaul bilkul desh ke maahaul jaisaa banane kii puri koshish kii gai he
 Now, if we talk about the issues of the country, then there is the issue of Kashmir and nationalism on everybody's tongue
 tiarapy kii list main sho ko apni jagah banane ke liye logon se conect hona bhi bahut jaruri he
 So the makers of the show have decided to make some such contestants a part of the show
 jinaki samaaj main acchhee pakad ho
 The name of the disputed contestant also adds to the good grip in the society
 tabhi is baar ek aise contestant kii entry sho main hone ja rahi he jiskaa naata sirf vivaadon se rahaa he
 We are talking about Hindustani Bhau, Vikas Pathak
 vikaas pathak ne ghar menentryle lee he
 Vikas Pathak remains in the limelight only for his domineering and rowdy style
 vikaas pathak bharat ke popular utubar hai
 If content is inflammatory and controversial, social media can make anyone famous
 bas popular hone kaa yahi formula hindustani bhaau ko mil gaya he
 Now Bigg Boss is also preparing to go ahead with his help
 Jo sadasya jail ke andar jayenge, kya woh sach mein game ke agle padhaav se bahar nikal jayenge?jaanne ke liye dekhiye # biggboss13aaj raat 10:30 baje

 Something similar has happened with the world's first ATM machine
 ji haa, duniya kii is pehali atm mashin ne haal hi main manaaya he apana 50waan berthde
 The year before, on 27 June 1967, the world's first ATM machine was installed at the branch of Barclays Bank in Anfield, London
 is mashin ke 50wein janmdin ke maukey par bank ne ise sone kaa atm bana diya he
 
 
 According to reports, the idea of building the world's first ATM was the result of the thinking of John Shepherd Baron
 or yah vichaar unke man main tab aayaa, jab ek baar bahut jaruri kaam se unhen paise nikaalane the, lekin bank band hone ke chalate ve aisa nahin kar paae the
 The comments apane ek saakshaatkaar main bairan ne bataaya tha ki ek chocolate baar dispencer ko dekhakar hi unke dimag main atm kaa vichaar aayaa
 Baron was born in Shillong, India in the year 1925
 bairan ke vichaar ke anusaar japan main 1966 main pehali mashin bani
 But it did not actually become an ATM
 ise ek computer lone mashin kaha ja saktaa he, kyonki yah card ke istemaal se lone detii thi
 After this Barclays Bank created the first ATM machine to give cash to people with PIN or special check
 landan ke enfield main lagaai gai duniya kii pehali atm mashin se sabase pehle british abhinayta reg varnay ne paison kii nikasi kii thi
 This machine used a special check, which was used as a matching PIN number
 aaj yah mashin kaaphi badal chuki he
 In one of his interviews, Baron had said that the idea of an ATM came to his mind after seeing a chocolate bar dispenser
 bairan saal 1925 main bharat ke shilong main paidaa hue the
 According to Baron's view, the first machine was made in Japan in 1966
 lekin yah asal main atm nahin ban pai
 It can be called a computer loan machine, as it used to give loans using the card
 iske baad barkellege bank ne logon ko pin yaa khaas chack se paise nakad dene vaali pehali atm mashin banaai
 British actor Reg Varnay was the first to withdraw money from the world's first ATM machine installed in Enfield, London
 is mashin main ek khaas check kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha, jiskaa milan pin number ke taur par istemaal kiya gaya
 Today this machine has changed a lot
 landan ke enfield main lagaai gai duniya kii pehali atm mashin se sabase pehle british abhinayta reg varnay ne paison kii nikasi kii thi
 This machine used a special check, which was used as a matching PIN number
 aaj yah mashin kaaphi badal chuki he

 On the sting operation 'hurriyat' till date, former army chief General VK Singh said, burning schools with money is terrorism and in this way action will be taken against those who spread terrorism
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki hurriyat par bain laga dena chahie
 In fact, India Today's Special Investigation Team (SIT), in its investigation, had exposed the sly financiers of the stone-pelters

 aap agar aisa sochate hai kii aapke toilet kii seat sabase zyada gandi he to aapako ek baar apane mobile phone kii screen ko dekhne kii jarurat he
 Actually, in a research a few days ago, it has been revealed that on your mobile phone screen, there are also germs from your toilet seat
 is lihaaj se yah toilet seat se bhi zyada gandi he
 Research has shown that more than 35 percent of people who use mobiles never clean their mobile phone screen properly
 is vajah se isapar keetanu samay dar samay baithte rahete hai
 The comments yah bhi padhein:ruthi garlfriend ko manaane ke liye yuvak ne kiya kuch aisa, peeche pad gai police
 
 
 It has been said in the research that in the mobile phones that were tested during the research, on average, all the phones were found three times more dirty than the toilet seat
 shodh ke anusaar har 20 main se ek mobile phone upabhokta har chah maheene main ek baar hi apan phone kii screen ko saaf karata he
 During this research, the researchers examined the screen of the phone of iphone, Samsung and Google
 is dauraan pataa chalaa ki phone kaa istemaal karne vaale upabhokta apane phone ke prati zyada jaagruk nahin he
 This is the reason why they do not use them even after all the products are available to clear the phone screen in the market
 shodh main bataaya gaya ki agar samay rahete phone upabhokta apni in aadaton ko nahin badalte hai to unhen aage iskaa bada khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he

 During this time, it was found that the consumer using the phone is not very aware of his phone

 Research has been told that if the phone users do not change their habits in time, then they may have to bear the brunt of it further

 bharat sarkaar ne Chandrayaan-2 kii lonching se thik pehle ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaah main katautee kar di thi
 The Central Government has said in an order issued on 12 June 2019 that ISRO scientists and engineers have been getting two additional increments since the year 1996, the incentive grant amount is being discontinued
 ye haal tab he jab isro ke vaigyanikon kii uplabdhi par puure desh ko garv he
 Now the Space Engineers Association (SEA), an organization of ISRO scientists, has named ISRO Chairman Dr
 ke
 In a letter to Sivan, he has demanded that he help cancel the order of the Central Government, which cuts the salary of ISRO scientists
 kyonki vaigyanikon ke paas tankhwaah ke alaava kamai kaa koi anya jariya nahin he
 SEA President A
 maniraman ne isro chif ko likhe patr main kaha he ki sarkari karmchaaree kii tankhwaah main kisi bhi tarah kii katautee tab tak nahin kii ja sakati, jab tak behad gambhir sthiti na khadi ho jaae
 Salary cuts will reduce the enthusiasm of scientists
 ham vaigyanik centre sarkaar ke faisle se behad hairat main hai or dukhi hai
 Read, Aajtak was the first to state that the salary of ISRO scientists cut before Chandrayaan-2 has been made point-wise by SEA in a letter to ISRO Chief
 
 
 isro vaigyanikon ke liye do atirikt vetan vruddhi kii anumati raashtrapati ne di thi
 So that the best talent present in the country is encouraged to become ISRO scientist
 saath hi isro vaigyanik bhi prerit ho sake
 These additional increments were implemented by the Department of Space in 1996 following a Supreme Court order
 supreme court ke aadesh main kaha tha ki is vetan vruddhi ko spasht taur par 'tankhwaah' mana jaae
 The Sixth Pay Commission also recommended continuation of this increment
 saath hi kaha gaya tha ki iskaa laabh isro vaigyanikon ko milte rahanaa chahie
 Two additional increments were implemented so that the young scientists coming to ISRO could get inspiration at the time of appointment and they could work for a long time in ISRO
 centre sarkaar ke aadesh main parformens related incentive skim (PRIS) kaa zikr he
 We would like to point out that both the additional increment and PRIS are completely different
 ek incentive he, jabaki doosraa tankhwaah he
 The two do not meet each other in any way
 sarkari karmchaaree kii tankhwaah main kisi bhi tarah kii katautee tab tak nahin kii ja sakati, jab tak behad gambhir sthiti na khadi ho jaae
 Letter written by ISRO Scientists Organization to ISRO Chief
 isro vaigyanikon ke sanghathan dwaara isro chif ko likhi gai chitthee
 This was the central government's cut-off order
it has been said in this order that from July 1, 2019, this incentive amount will be stopped
 is aadesh ke baad D, E, f or g shrenee ke vaigyanikon ko yah protsaahan raashi ab nahin milegi
 ISRO has about 16 thousand scientists and engineers
 lekin is sarkari aadesh se isro ke kareeb 85 se 90 fisadi vaigyanikon or ejiniyaron kii tankhwaah main 8 se 10 hajaar rupye kaa nuksaan hoga
 Because most scientists fall into these categories
 ise lekar isro vaigyanik naaraaz hai
 Explain that this incentive amount was started in the year 1996 to encourage scientists, increase their inclination towards ISRO and not leave the institute
 centre sarkaar kii ore se jari aadesh main kaha gaya he ki chathe vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par vitt mantralay or vyay vibhaag ne antariksh vibhaag ko salaah di he ki vah is protsaahan raashi ko band kare
 Instead, only the Performance Related Incentive Scheme (PRIS) has been implemented
 ab tak isro apane vaigyanikon ko protsaahan raashi or PRIS skim donon suvidhaayen de rahaa tha
 But now the central government has decided that this incentive amount given as additional salary will stop getting from July 1
 c shrenee main hoti he isro vaigyanikon kii bhartee, pramotion par milti thi protsaahan raashiisro main kisi vaigyanik kii bhartee c shrenee se shuru hoti he
 They are then promoted to D, E, F, g and so forth
 har shrenee main pramotion se pehle ek test hota he, use paas karne vaale ko yah protsaahan anudaan raashi milti he
 But now when the salary of July comes in August, then scientists will see a cut in it

 inmahawvapurna taarikh-25 disambaronline aavedan patr kii hard copy jamaa karne kii antim taarikh-10 janvari, 2017 Henna is not only one of the sixteen adornments, but is also seen as an auspicious omen
 hamaare desh main koi bhi khaas mauka ho, haathon main menhadi rachaae bina puraa nahin mana jaataa
 But henna looks beautiful only when its color is dark and it is composed properly
 mehandi kaa ek khaas gaharaa laal rang hota he jo haathon par behad khubasurat lagata he
 Many a times it happens that henna is very good, but because of not creating it properly, beautiful design also does not come into bloom
 aise main aap in upayon ko apanaakar gahari or khubasurat menhadi rachaa sakati hai
 However, first make sure that your rosemary solution is well prepared
 in upayon ko apnaane se gahari rachegi menhadi :1
 It is very important to be patient after applying henna
 kam se kam paanch se chah ghante ke liye menhadi ko haathon par rache rahane den
 This makes the color of henna deeper
 2
 The use of lemon and sugar solution also increases the color of rosemary
 darasal, is ghol ko lagane se menhadi zyada der ke liye haathon main chipki rahati he or isse uskaa rang gaharaa ho jaataa he
 3
 fring pan main laung kii kuch kaliyon ko daalkar haath par unka dhuna lenaa bhi ek kargar upaay he
 By doing this, henna color becomes darker
 4
 Do not use water to get rid of henna
 ho sake to 10 se 12 ghanton tak haathon par pani ke istemaal se bachein
 It would be better if you stay away from using soap
 menhadi chhudaane ke baad sarson ke tel ko haathon par mel len
 By adopting these measures, the color of henna increases
 pakistan ke aakraamak harfanmaulaa shahid afridi ne kaha he ki vishwacap ke liye vanade team kii captaini ko lekar atakalbaaji ab band ho jaani chahie, kyonki misbah ul haq iske liye sarvshereshth vikalp hai
 Afridi told reporters in Islamabad on Friday that Misbah has done well as a Test and ODI captain so far and he is the best option to command the team in the World Cup
 unhone kaha, meraa maananaa he ki yah masalaa ab khatm ho janaa chahie, kyonki vishwacap main ab der nahin he or misbah sarvshereshth vikalp hai
 Afridi said that he and the other players are completely with Misbah and there is no factionalism in the team
 afridi ne kaha, mujhe nahin pataa ki media mere naam se galat bayaan jari karke vivaad kyon paidaa karata rahata he
 Everything i say is twisted and introduced

 62-year-old Modi, who came into politics after working as a pracharak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has created a different image in the name of development in Gujarat
 haalanki vivaadon se bhi unka gaharaa rishta rahaa he
 The Gujarat riots that raged after the Godhraq in 2002 still haunt them, in which more than 1,000 people of the Muslim community were killed
 jab-tab sangh parivaar ke 'hindutv kii prayogshaala' kahe jane vaale gujarat ke mukhyamantri par rajya main sampradayik aadhaar par dhuvrikaran ke bhi aarope lagate rahe hai
 Modi's opponents also target him fiercely
 haalanki party or uske baahar unke prashansakon or samarthakon kii sankhya bhi kam nahin he
 Modi made several attempts to woo Muslims in the state, but his opponents have always portrayed him as a leader who does not care about the community
 unke aalochak kehete hai ki un par hameshaa gujarat dangon kaa dhabba laga rahegaa
 Modi recently said in an interview that if he is found guilty, he is ready to be hanged
 duusari taraf modi ke samarthak unhen 'hindu hriday samraat' kahkar bhi vaahvahee karte hai
 The situation in Gujarat changes so much that Congress President Sonia Gandhi's statement that Modi was called a 'merchant of death' in the 2007 assembly elections was upset
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par 11 saal ke anubhav or apane dam par lagaataar teesri safalataa hasil karne vaale modi 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main khud ko party ke pradhanmantri pad ke majboot daavedaar ke taur par pesh kar sakate hai
 Modi has made history by winning elections for the third consecutive time at a time when the party needs strong leadership to return to power at the Center
 modi 2001 main keshubhai kii jagah mukhyamantri bane the
 Keshubhai split from BJP this year to form his new party 'gujarat Parivartan Party'
 tippaniyan Chief Minister Modi made several attempts to woo the Muslim community, but did not give a single Muslim candidate a ticket in this election
 unhone apane adarsh swami vivekanand ke 150veen jayanti varsh main gujarat main yatra nikaalkar janata se sidhe sampark saadhaa
 After the 2002 riots, then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had asked Modi to follow his 'raj Dharma', but LK Advani and the late Pramod Mahajan helped Modi to continue as the Chief Minister
 uske baad modi ne kabhi peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 In the earlier political journey, he was the organization secretary of the party in Gujarat and later also held the responsible post at the party headquarters in Delhi
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke prachaarak ke taur par kaam karne ke baad raajnneeti main aae 62-varshiya modi ne gujarat main vikaas ke naam par alag chhavi banaai he
 However, he also has a deep connection with controversies
 2002 main godhracand ke baad bhadke gujarat dangon kaa daag un par aaj bhi kaayam he, jisamen muslim samudaay ke 1,000 se adhik log maare gaye the
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat, who has been called the 'laboratory of Hindutva' of the Sangh Parivar, has also been accused of polarizing the communal grounds in the state
 modi ke virdohi bhi un par jamkar nishaanaa sadhate hai
 However, the number of fans and supporters outside the party and beyond is also not small
 modi ne pradesh main muslimon ko lubhaane ke kai prayaas kiye, lekin unke virdohi hameshaa unki chhavi is samudaay kaa dhyaan nahin rakhane vaale netaa ke taur par pesh karte rahe hai
 His critics say that he will always be stained by the Gujarat riots
 modi ne haal hi main ek intervyuu main kaha tha ki agar unhen doshi paaya gaya, to vah faansee par latakane ke liye taiyaar hai
 On the other hand, Modi's supporters also acclaim him as 'hindu Hriday Samrat'
 gujarat main halaat is kadar badalte hai ki 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main modi ko 'maut kaa saudagar' kehane sambandhi congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke bayaan se bakheda khadaa ho gaya tha
 Modi, who has 11 years of experience as the Chief Minister of Gujarat and third successive success on his own, can present himself as a strong contender for the party's post of Prime Minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 modi ne aise samay main lagaataar teesri baar chunaav jitkar itihaas banaaya he, jab party ko centre kii satta main lautne ke liye majboot netritv kii jarurat he
 In 2001, Modi became the Chief Minister in place of Keshubhai
 keshubhai ne is saal bijepi se alag hokar apni nai party 'gujarat parivartan party' bana lee
 The comments mukhyamantri modi ne muslim samudaay ko lubhaane ke anek prayaas kiye, lekin is chunaav main ek bhi muslim ummidavaar ko tikat nahin diya
 In the 150th birth anniversary year of his idol Swami Vivekananda, he took out a journey in Gujarat and made direct contact with the public
 2002 ke dangon ke baad tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne modi ko apana 'raaj dharm' nibhaane kii naseehat di thi, lekin laalkrishna adwani or divangat pramod mahajan ne modi ko mukhyamantri ke pad par bane rahane main madad kii

 Not only this, Salman's love for his former girlfriends does not hide
 yah baat wo gaahe-bagaahe apni harkaton se jagajaahir bhi kar dete hai
 Salman Khan's special love for Salman Khan once again surfaced when Dabangg Salman mentioned the name of his ex-girlfriend Aishwarya Rai Bachchan during the reality show Bigg Boss-7
 darasal, big bos kii ek contestant shilpa sakalani se baat karte hue salmaan ne unki tulana apni purv premika ke saath kar di
 He told Shilpa, 'your face is like Aishwarya's
 ' haalanki pehle unhone apane chir-parichit andaaj main sirf aishwarya naam kaa ullekh kiya lekin turant hi yah bhi bataa diya ki wo ab aishwarya raay bachchan ho chuki hai

 salmaan pehle bhi aisa kar chuke hai
 Just a few days ago, he compared a contestant, Eli Iwaram, to his former girlfriend Katrina Kaif
 unhone eli everaam ko paanch saal pehle kii katrina caff bataaya tha
 Although it is difficult to ignore these antics of Salman, but it is even more difficult to ignore Salman's attraction towards girls who look like his former girlfriends

 ) In the Kulbhushan Jadhav case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague has stayed the execution of Jadhav, rejecting Pakistan's claims, which has caused a stir in Pakistan since then

 The Pakistani government has come under attack from the media and the opposition since the international court stayed the execution of Sajadhav against the decision of the Pakistan military court
 lihaaja antarrashtriya adaalat ke faisle se hataash pakistan sarkaar ab jadhav masale kii pairvi ke liye vakeelon kii nai team gathit karegi
 On Thursday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's foreign affairs adviser Sartaj Ajit said that the Pakistani lawyer in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case strongly presented his stand in the international court
 haalanki ICJ ne jadhav maamle main rajanyik acces par apana vichaar diya he
 The Pakistani newspaper quoted Sartaj as saying that the security of Pakistan is very important and we also have to maintain our sovereignty
 sartaaj ne kaha ki ab jadhav maamle kii pairvi ke liye pakistan vakeelon kii nai team gathit karegi, jo ICJ main apana paksh majbootee ke saath rakhenge
 It is to be known that since the international court order on Jadhav case, the opposition government in Pakistan has come to dominate

 People of Pakistan are also taking the government in the back

 We became normal with every violence of the crowd, perhaps it was not our locality to be killed, it was not of our religion, but now the victims of this mob have also become Muslims, Hindus too
 gaay ke naam par bheed pahalu khan ko bhi maar chuki he, gaay ke naam par subodh kumaar singh bhi maare ja chuke hai
 So watch these videos again and again so that you can see the boys who are being mobilized to make the killer
 is bheed main sirf ladke hai
 18-20 year old boys
 har tarah ke bhay se azaad
 The fear of the police is gone
 un mukademon kaa bhi jinke kaaran in naujavaanon kaa bhavishya prabhavit ho saktaa he
 There is no major leader in this crowd
 bada netaa inhen vichaardhaara kii goli dekar apana kaam kar chukaa he
 Nobody is concerned about who is allegedly involved in the case of Gokshi, just whoever is in front is the accused
 aaj in naujavaanon main se kai hatya ke aarope main bhaage-bhaage phir rahe honge
 Whose gun shot and Subodh Kumar Singh died, he would continue to run from his crime throughout his life
 hatyara banane ke baad bade netaa bhi duuri bana lenge
 Many types of videos have been found
 ek video main awaz sunai de rahi he ki kathith rup se maance kahaan se aayaa, koun laayaa, kisne kaata
 The Police is investigating
 jinke khet main maance milane kii khabar ai thi wo jhagada nahin chaahate the, lekin duusare gaanv se log jhagade ke liye aa gaye
 His complete preparation is seen before arrival
 tractor, katte, hathiyaar, pathar, danda sab lekar aae the
 Watching a video of it is like placing a stone on the heart
 khet main jeep khadi he
 Watching the video, it seems that someone takes close to Subodh Kumar Singh with a pistol
 goli kii awaz aati he magar camera jab is adhikari ke paas pahunchataa he to vah aadmi frem se hat jaataa he
 Goes back
 awaz aati he are ye to esao
 After this, everyone starts running
 mangalvaar kii raat main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne bulandshahr kii ghatana ko lekar vishesh baithak bulaai
 Subodh Singh is not even mentioned in the press release issued after this incident
 press release main likhaa he- upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne aaj yahaan apane sarkari awaas par bulandshahr kii ghatana ke sambandh main mukhya sachiv, police mahanideshak, pramukh sachiv, grih, apper police mahanideshak ke saath baithak kii
 After reviewing this incident, the Chief Minister has instructed that strict investigation should be taken against all the persons involved in cow slaughter
 unhone kaha ki ghatana ek bade shadyatr kaa hissaa he
 All direct and indirect elements related to cow slaughter should be arrested in a timely manner
 unhone yah bhi nirdesh diya he ki abhiyaan chalaakar maahaul kharaab karne vaale tatwon ko benakaab kar is prakaar saazish rachane waalon ke viruddh prabhavi karrwai kii jaae
 It is not clear who are the elements who spoil the atmosphere by campaigning? Is the Chief Minister talking about action against the mob, then why is Subodh Kumar Singh not named in this press release
 gokshi main shaamil logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat he, magar subodh kumaar singh kii hatya main shaamil logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat is relies main nahin he
 There is also the fact that the police has formed an SIT to investigate the murder of Subodh Kumar Singh and the Chief Minister has called for 50 lakh compensation to his family and a job to a member

 We became normal with every violence of the crowd, perhaps it was not our locality to be killed, it was not of our religion, but now the victims of this mob have also become Muslims, Hindus too

 So watch these videos again and again so that you can see the boys who are being mobilized to make the killer

 18-20 year old boys
 har tarah ke bhay se azaad
 The fear of the police is gone

 There is no major leader in this crowd
 bada netaa inhen vichaardhaara kii goli dekar apana kaam kar chukaa he
 Nobody is concerned about who is allegedly involved in the case of Gokshi, just whoever is in front is the accused
 aaj in naujavaanon main se kai hatya ke aarope main bhaage-bhaage phir rahe honge
 Whose gun shot and Subodh Kumar Singh died, he would continue to run from his crime throughout his life
 hatyara banane ke baad bade netaa bhi duuri bana lenge
 Many types of videos have been found

 gokshi main shaamil logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat he, magar subodh kumaar singh kii hatya main shaamil logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat is relies main nahin he
 There is also the fact that the police has formed an SIT to investigate the murder of Subodh Kumar Singh and the Chief Minister has called for 50 lakh compensation to his family and a job to a member

 kai tarah ke video mili hai
 In a video, a voice is heard about where the meat allegedly came from, who brought it, who cut it
 police jaanch kar rahi he
 Those who had come to know of meat in their fields did not want to quarrel, but people from other villages came to quarrel
 aane se pehle unki puri taiyaari dikhti he
 Tractors, carts, weapons, stones, poles were all brought
 iskaa video dekhnaa kaleje par pathar rakhane jaisaa he
 Jeep is standing in the field

 On Tuesday night, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath called a special meeting regarding the incident in Bulandshahr
 is ghatana ke baad jo press release jari kii gai he usamen subodh singh kaa naam tak nahin he
 It is written in the press release - UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath held a meeting with the Chief Secretary, Director General of Police, Principal Secretary, Home, Additional Director General of Police in connection with the incident in Bulandshahr at his official residence here today
 mukhyamantri ji ne is ghatana kii samiksha kar nirdesh die hai ki isaki gambhirtha se jaanch kar gokshi main sanlipt sabhi vyaktiyon ke viruddh kathortam karrwai kii jaae
 He said that the incident is part of a larger conspiracy
 gokshi se sambandh rakhane vaale pratyaksh or apratyaksh sabhi tatwon ko samaybaddh rup se giraftaar kiya jaae
 He has also directed that effective campaign should be taken against those who create conspiracy by exposing the elements who spoil the atmosphere by campaigning
 yah saaf nahin ki abhiyaan chalaakar maahaul kharaab karne vaale tatv koun hai? kya mukhyamantri bheed ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat kar rahe hai to phir subodh kumaar singh kaa naam is press release main kyon nahin he
 There is talk of action against those involved in Gokshi, but action against those involved in the murder of Subodh Kumar Singh is not there in this release
 yah bhi tathy he ki police subodh kumaar singh kii hatya kii jaanch ke liye esaiti bana chuki he or mukhyamantri ne unke parivaar ko 50 lakh muawza or ek sadsy ko naukari kii baat kahi he
 Our colleague Saurabh Shukla is continuously reporting this incident
 unhone un saat logon kaa pataa kiya jinke naam gokshi vaali exiaar main hai
 Saurav Shukla says that the complainant in Gaukashi's case is Yogesh Raj
 jabaki khet rajkumaar pradhan kaa tha
 It may be that Subodh Kumar Singh has registered the names, which are being disputed on the correctness, in view of the chance of opportunity
 yahi nahin nayabas gaanv ke do bacchon ke naam bhi exiaar main daal die gaye hai
 One is 11 years old and the other is 12 years old
 unke pita ne saurabh se kaha ki itane chote bachche ye kaam nahin kar sakate hai or ye to us samay bulandshahr gaye the
 Our colleague Saurabh Shukla spoke to the wife of Rajkumar Pradhan, whose meat was thrown in the fields
 unhone saurav se yahi kaha ki ham maamle ko aage nahin badhanaa chaahate the
 But the crowd came and forced them to take the trolley forward
 yah bheed kis iraade se ai thi, bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 Premjit also has a farm next to Rajkumar Pradhan's farm
 vahaan bhi maance ke tukade pade the
 Prem Jeet Singh, while talking to Saurabh, took the name of Bajrang Dal
 exiaar main jinke naam hai unamem se ek yogesh raaj ke bare main media main ab kaaphi detail he
 Yogesh has photos and tweets on the site of print, wire, scroll
 vah sangh ke kaarykram main hissaa letaa hua dikhataa he to jeep par lathi lekar tasviir khinchaa rahaa he
 Bajrang Dal is the district convenor
 lekin police apni taraf se kisi sanghathan kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 Are the police afraid to name those organizations
 mangalvaar ko press conference main ediji laa and order anand kumaar ne kyon kaha ki sanghathan mahatvapurn nahin he
 It is not right to take the name of the organization, it is written in which police manual of the world
 yah kaayda kab bana he
 Subodh Raj is absconding
 magar uskaa bayaan whatsap par chal rahaa he
 That's quite right video main nahaaya dhoyaa lagata he
 Appearing in pink kurta
 nishcint bhi dikh rahaa he
 Therefore, there is no need to worry about Yogesh
 exiaar main yogesh raaj ke alaava 26 or naam hai
 In one part of the FIR it is written that the above named persons of the mob continued to incite violence, in which all the people involved in this mob group had an opinion led by the above persons to kill them with illegal weapons, sharp weapons, sticks and sticks
 We intentionally attacked the policemen, in which Subodh Kumar Singh, the in-charge inspector was shot and seriously injured and the in-charge inspector The Ana to Gekr was his personal Laisensi pistol and three mobile phones official Siusi Sim, take the spoil and continued firing
 sarkari wireles seton ko tod diya va chaowkee kii sarkari va privet sampatti main aag laga di
 When the officer Siyana entered the room of the outpost to save her life, the crowd became furious and set fire to the outpost, making the noise of the beatings
 police lagaataar aatmaraksharth peeche hatati ja rahi thi or arajak tatwon kii ukt bheed lagaataar acroshit or hamalavar hote hue maaro maaro kaa shor machaate hue badi ja rahi thi
 The comments bheed ke paas pathar, katte, goliyaan, hathiyaar kahaan se aae? kya ye sab achaanak maukey se juta liya jaataa he yaa kisi taiyaari kaa hissaa hota he
 Was the image of Subodh Kumar Singh created in a special way, due to which he was targeted
 jile bhar ke bhaajapa netaaon kaa ek patr mila he jo unhone isi ek sitambar ko apane saasand bholaa singh ko likhaa tha
 It is written in one part of the letter - i want to make you aware that the behavior of Inspector in charge Siana Subodh Kumar Singh is indecent towards the general public
 kshetra main chori, pashuchori, avaidh vaahan badhate ja rahe hai, kshetra main vaahan checking ke naam par nagar vaasiyon ko anaavashyak rup se pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he evam avaidh vasuuli kii ja rahi he
 There is anger in Hindu society by creating obstacles in organizing religious functions of Hindus

 saansad ne patr milane kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he magar kya kuch karrwai bhi kii gai thi, is bare main nahin bataaya
 Watching a video of it is like placing a stone on the heart

 Watching the video, it seems that someone takes close to Subodh Kumar Singh with a pistol
 goli kii awaz aati he magar camera jab is adhikari ke paas pahunchataa he to vah aadmi frem se hat jaataa he
 Goes back

 Our colleague Saurabh Shukla is continuously reporting this incident

 Saurav Shukla says that the complainant in Gaukashi's case is Yogesh Raj
 jabaki khet rajkumaar pradhan kaa tha

 People chained the thieves and beat them for hours
 darasal, railway stesan par mobile chori karte 4 choron ko logon ne range haathon pakad liya
 After this, taking the law in hand, the four people beat them up half-heartedly
 is dauraan police mookadarshak bani rahi
 The Supreme Court has expressed concern over the misuse of the anti-dowry law
 court ne kaha ki ‘asantusht’ patniyon dwaara apane pati or sasuraal ke anya sadasyon ke khilaaf dahej virdohi kanoon kaa durupyog chintaa kaa vishay he
 With this, the court has given a new arrangement that the police cannot automatically arrest the accused in the case
 maamle main aise kadam kii vajah bataani hogi jinaki nyaayik samiksha kii jaaegi
 The Supreme Court said that the attitude of arrest first and then the rest of the action is 'reprehensible' which should be curbed
 court ne sabhi rajya sarkaron ko yah sunishchit karne kaa nirdesh diya ki dahej pratadna maamle sahit saat saal tak kii sajaa ke dandaneey aparaadhon main police giraftaar kaa sahaara nahin le
 a division bench headed by Judge Chandramouli Kumar Prasad said, "we direct all the state governments to instruct their police officers not to make arrest on their mind if a case is registered under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code
" 
 pehle dand prakriya samhita kii dhara 41 main pradutt maapdandon ke tahat giraftaar kii aavashyaktaa ke bare main khud ko santusht karen
 Like a weapon instead of armor, the use of court said that the police officer would have to present reasons and material to the magistrate about the need to arrest him
 jaj ne kaha, 'pati or uske rishtedaaron dwaara stri ko pratadit karne kii samasya par ankush paane ke iraade se bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 498-k shaamil kii gai thi
 Section 498-A, being a cognizable and non-bailable offense, has a dubious place in the provisions which disgruntled wives use as weapons instead of armor
 'giraftaar se baadhit hoti he swatantraamaamle main jajon ne kaha, 'pareshaan karne kaa sabase aasaan tarika pati or uske rishtedaaron ko is praavdhaan ke tahat giraftaar karana he
 In many cases, her husband's incapacitated grandparents, her sisters who have lived abroad for decades, were also arrested
 giraftaar vyakti kii swatantraaa ko baadhit or use apamaanit karti he or hameshaa ke liye dhabba lagaati he
 No arrest should be made just because the offense is non-bailable and cognizable
 'jajon ne kaha, 'giraftaar karne kaa adhikaar ek baat he or iske istemaal ko nyyochit tehraana duusari baat he
 Police officers with the right to arrest should be able to justify the reasons for doing so
 kisi vyakti ke khilaaf aparaadh karne kaa aarope lagane ke aadhaar par hi fori taur par koi giraftaar nahin kii jaani chahie
 It would be appropriate for a far-sighted and intelligent police officer to not make any arrest without being properly satisfied after a brief investigation into the veracity of the allegations
 aparaadh ke aankadon kaa zikr karte hue court ne kaha ki 2012 main dhara 498-k ke tahat aparaadh ke liye 197762 vyakti giraftaar kiye gaye or is praavdhaan ke tahat giraftaar vyaktiyon main se kareeb ek chauthai patiyon kii maa or bahan jaisi mahilayen thim jinhen giraftaar ke jaal main liya gaya
 The court said that this constitutes six per cent of the total arrested persons for offenses under the Indian Penal Code
 yah dand samhita kii vibhinn dhaaraon ke tahat hue kul aparaadhon kaa 4
 5 per cent, which is higher than any other offenses like theft and injury
 aise maamalon main aarope patr daakhil karne kii dar 93
 The rate is up to 6 percent, while the conviction rate is only 15 percent
 do mahilaon sahit ek hi parivaar ke paanch sadasyon kii kuch agyaat logon ne yahaan kii jammu colony main dhardaar hathiyaar se hatya kar di
 Police said Satpal (40), his wife Veena Rani (45), son Mukesh (25), daughter-in-law Suman (23), besides another son Rinku (22) were killed with sharp weapons on Saturday morning
 is ghatana ke bare main satpal ke bhai ne police ko soochna di
 Police said Veena Rani's body was found in the store house while the body of other family members was found from a room in the house
 satpal ek marij beuro chalaata tha
 He said that a case has been registered in connection with this murder at Farrakpur Police Station and the matter is being investigated
 shrishri ravishankar aaj achaanak higorakhanath mandirpahunche or mukhyamantri yogi adityanath se mulaakaat kii
 The meeting lasted for about half an hour, according to sources in which the temple issue was discussed
 haalanki donon pakshon kii ore se iskaa saarvajanik zikr nahin kiya gaya he
 Chief Minister Yogip has already said that talks should take place, but he only has hope from the court now
 mukhyamantri offis ke sutron ke mutabik ye mulaakaat mahaj shishtachar or holi ke pehle kii badhai ke liye thi, lekin is mulaakaat ke kai myne hai
 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has gone on a mission to resolve the Ayodhya case outside the court and the meeting is being linked to the same link
 somvaar ko kanpur main shri shri ravishankar ne kaha tha ki vah sabhi pakshon se baat kar rahe hai or jald hi iske samaadhaan ke saath saamne aaenge
 On February 28, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar will be in Lucknow and it is expected that he will continue the discussion behind the scenes regarding the temple issue there too
 gauratlab he ki 1 march ko lakhanu main salmaan nadvi ke saath shri shri ravishankar lakhanu main ek saajha press conference karenge, jisamen maanav kalyaan board yani human welfare board kaa elaan hoga
 This board is being specially created to settle the Ayodhya dispute outside the court

 china ke yunaan praant ke kunming shahar main sthit military academy main donon deshon kii senaaon ke bich ye paanchvaan sainya abhyaas hua jiskaa naam tha hand in hand 2015
 In this exercise, the armies of both countries practiced counter-terrorism operations along the india-china border
 haalanki ye haasyaaspad he kyonki aisi jaankaree bhi he ki uttar purv ke aatankiyon ko china hathiyaar detaa rahaa he
 In a statement issued by the Ministry of Defense of India, it said, "A joint ground exercise, demonstrating anti-terrorism operations in the indo-china border area, was conducted from 21 to 22 October to confirm the goals of the exercise
 ’tippaniyan The statement said, 'A series of challenging strategic positions were introduced to confirm the response of the sub-units and a high degree of professionalism and coordination was observed between the military personnel of the two armies
 ’ mantralay kii ore se jari ek video footage main donon pakshon ko ek sanyukt abhiyaan main ek aatankwaadi shivi par chapa maarthe or usapar niyantran karte hue dikhaaya gaya he
 The exercise of both the armies along the border is being given importance in view of the recent tensions between the Indian and Chinese armies in the Ladakh region
 kunming abhyaason kaa zikr karte hue press vijyapti main kaha gaya he ki sanyukt abhyaas ne ‘aatankwaad nirodhi prashikshan or aatankwaad nirodhi abhiyaanon ke anubhavon ke aadan-pradaan karne, donon senaaon ke bich paraspar vishwaas evam samaj badhaane or swasth sainya sambandhon ko badhaava dene ke tay uddeshyon ko puraa kiya
 ' jahaan bharat kashmir main ugravadiyon kii ghuspaith kaa saamana kar rahaa he, china shinjiyang main east turkistan islamic movement (itim) main aatankwaadiyon se sangharsh kar rahaa he
 This was the fifth military exercise between the armies of the two countries, called Hand in Hand 2015, at the Military Academy located in Kunming City, Yunnan Province, China
 is abhyaas main donon deshon kii senaaon ne bharat-china seemaa par aatankwaad nirodhi abhiyaan kaa abhyaas kiya
 However, it is ridiculous because there is also information that China has been giving weapons to the terrorists of the North East
