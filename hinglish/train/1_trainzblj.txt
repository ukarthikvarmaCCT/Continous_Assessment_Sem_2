 apane partner ke saath rishte main mithaas gholne ke liye log aksar badi-badi jugat lagaate najar aate hai
 Such efforts succeed
 par rishte main garmahat laane kaa sabase aasaan upaay he, apane saathi ko pyaar bhari najaron se ek choti-si muskaan kaa tohfa dena
 Many advantages of this smile are clearly visible
 isse apana tanaav to dur hota hi he, partner ke dil ko bhi bharpoor sukun pahunchataa he
 It is very natural that when someone smiles at you with loving eyes, you too cannot live without smiling
 vaise bhi yah shishtachar kaa takaza he ki muskaan kaa 'pratidaan' muskaan yaa pyaari-si hansi ke rup main hi saamne aae
 There are also many types of smiles

 When this line gradually increases and widens, the person in front is unable to remain untouched

 Many times one has to resort to smiling to hide the sorrow of the heart, 'you are so smiling
 
 
 
 'even in this situation, the gum should not be removed by smiling, but the gum becomes less necessary

 To win over one's heart, keep smiling to rule the heart

 Bal Thackeray, who played a very important role on the political stage of Maharashtra, from making cartoons with an impressive message, was a symbol of Marathi pride and Hindutva, whose warm spirit made him the Lord of Shiv Sainiks
 shivasena ke 86-varshiya pramukh ko unke shivasainik bhagwaan kii tarah puujate the or unke virdohi bhi unke is kad se puri tarah waakif the
 Thackeray, who changed the direction of Maharashtra's politics in every way, always gave his friends and opponents the opportunity to underestimate him politically, so that he could execute his intentions cleanly
 vah aksar khud badi jimmedaari lene kii bajaay kingmekar bananaa zyada pasand karte the
 For some, this lion of Maharashtra was a cultural ideal in itself
 apni anguli ke ek ishaare se desh kii vittiya rajdhani kii raunak ko sannaate main badalane kii takat rakhane vaale bal thakare ne aarake lakshmana ke saath angreji dainik free press jarnal main 1950 ke dashak ke ant main cartoonist ke taur par apana kariyar shuru kiya tha, lekin 1960 main unhone cartoon saptahik 'maarmik' kii shuruyaat karke ek nae raste kii taraf kadam badhaayaa
 This weekly used to contain material that fueled the struggle for its identity in the 'marathi Manus' and raised the voice of the increasing number of migrants in the city
 thakare kaa marathi samarthak mantra kaam kar gaya or unki yah baat ki 'maharashtra marathiyon kaa he', sthaneey logon main is kadar lokapriy hua ki unki party ne 2007 main bijepi ke saath purana gathbandhan hone ke baavjood raashtrapati ke chunaav main apni ek alag raay banaai or upie kii raashtrapati pad kii ummidavaar pratibha patil kaa samarthan kiya, jo maharashtra se thim
 He criticized Sachin Tendulkar in 2009, who said that Mumbai belongs to the whole of India
 thakare ne 19 june, 1966 ko shivasena kii sthapana kii or uske baad marathiyon kii tamaam samasyaon ko hal karne kii jimmedaari apane sir le lee
 He sought job security for the Marathas, who were facing stiff competition from the people of Gujarat and South India
 23 janvari, 1926 ko janme bal keshav seetaram thakare kii chaar santanon main duusare the
 His father was a writer and an active activist of the 'united Maharashtra Movement' movement demanding a separate state for Marathi speaking people
 khud ko hitler kaa prashansak bataane vaale bal thakare ne maharashtra main marathiyon kii ek aisi sena banaai, jinka istemaal vah vibhinn kapadaa milon or anya audyogic ikaayiyon main marathiyon ko naukariyaan aadi dilaane main kiya karte the
 His efforts made him 'hindu heart emperor'
 haalanki thakare ne khud kabhi koi chunaav nahin ladaa, lekin shivasena ko ek purna raajnneetik dal banane ke beej boe jab unke shivasainikon ne bollywood sahit vibhinn udyogon main majdoor sanghathanon par niyantran karnaa shuru kiya
 The Shiv Sena soon gained its roots and took over the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in the 1980s with the support of the pro-marathi mantra
 bijepi ke saath 1995 main gathbandhan karnaa thakare ke raajnneetik jivan kaa sabase bada mauka tha or isi ke dam par unhone pehali baar satta kaa swaad chakhaa
 He himself used to say that he runs the government with 'remote control'
 haalanki unhone mukhyamantri kaa pad kabhi nahin sambhala
 Many believe that the Shiv Sainiks played an important role in the communal riots that followed the 1993 Mumbai blasts, which helped the sena-bjp alliance to garner Hindu votes
 'marathi manus' kii nabj ko bahut acchhee tarah samajhane kaa hunar rakhane vaale bal thakare is kahawat ke pakke samarthak the ki zyada kareebi se asammaan panapata he or isiilie unhone sadaa khud ko sarvshereshth bataaya
 The comments apane samarthakon se zyada ghulana-milanaa or kareebi unhen pasand nahin thi or vah apane behad suraksha vaale awaas 'matoshri' kii balakani se apane samarthakon ko darshan diya karte the
 Millions of people thronged to hear his fiery speeches at famous Dussehra rallies
 pakistan or muslim samudaay ko akasar nishane par rakhane vaale bal thakare ne ek baar muslim samudaay ko cancer tak kah daalaa tha
 He had said, Islamic terrorism is on the rise and Hindu terrorism is the only way to respond to it
 hamen bharat or hinduon ko bachaane ke liye aatmghaatee bam daste kii jarurat he
 Thackeray, who sat on the throne with various images of the tiger, dominated Maharashtra politics for years
 unke paas koi pad yaa ohada nahin tha, lekin unke prabhaav kaa yah alam tha ki matoshri ne raajnneetik netaaon se lekar, filmi sitaron, khilaadiyon or udyog jagat kii diggaj hastiyon kii agavaani kii
 The 86-year-old chief of the Shiv Sena was venerated by his Shiv Sainik lord and his opponents were also fully aware of his stature
 apane har andaaj se maharashtra kii raajnneeti kii disha badalane vaale thakare apane mitron or virodhiyon ko hameshaa yah mauka dete rahe ki vah unhen raajnneetik rup se kam karke anken, taaki vah apane iraadon ko safai se anjaam de saken
 He often preferred to be a kingmaker rather than taking on a big responsibility himself
 kuch ke liye maharashtra kaa yah sher apane aap main ek saanskrithik adarsh tha
 Bal Thackeray, who had the power to transform the financial capital of the country into a silence with a gesture of his finger, started his career as a cartoonist with RK Laxman in the English daily Free Press Journal in the late 1950s, but In 1960, he started a new path by launching the cartoon weekly 'marmik'
 is saptahik main aisi saamagree hua karti thi, jo 'marathi manus' main apni pahchaan ke liye sangharsh karne kaa jajba bhar detii thi or isi se shahar main pravaasiyon kii badhati sankhya ko lekar aawaaj buland kii gai
 Thackeray's pro-marathi mantra worked and his saying that 'maharashtra belongs to the Marathis' became so popular among the locals that his party formed a different opinion in the presidential election in 2007 despite having an old alliance with the BJP And supported UPA presidential candidate Pratibha Patil, who was from Maharashtra
 unhone 2009 main sachin tendulkar kii aalochana kar daali, jinhone kaha tha ki mumbai puure bharat kii he
 Thackeray founded the Shiv Sena on 19 June 1966 and after that took the responsibility of solving all the problems of the Marathas
 unhone marathiyon ke liye naukari kii suraksha maangi, jinhen gujarat or dakshin bharat ke logon se kadi pratispardhaa kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa tha
 Born on January 23, 1926, Bal Keshav was the second of four children of Sitaram Thackeray
 unke pita lekhak the or marathi bhashi logon ke liye alag rajya kii maang karne vaale andolan 'sanyukt maharashtra andolan' ke sakriy kaaryakarta the
 Bal Thackeray, who describes himself as an admirer of Hitler, created an army of Marathas in Maharashtra, which he used to provide jobs to Marathas in various textile mills and other industrial units
 unke inhen prayaason ne unhen 'hindu hriday samraat' bana diya
 Though Thackeray himself never contested any election, it sowed the seeds of making the Shiv Sena a full-fledged political party when his Shiv Sainiks began to control trade unions in various industries, including Bollywood
 shivasena ne jald hi apni jaden jamaa leen or 1980 ke dashak main marathi samarthak mantra ke sahare brihanmumbai nagar nigam par kabja kar liya
 Forging an alliance with the BJP in 1995 was the biggest opportunity in Thackeray's political life and it was on this basis that he tasted power for the first time
 vah khud kehete the ki vah 'remote control' se sarkaar chalaate hai
 However, he never held the post of Chief Minister
 bahut se logon kaa maananaa he ki 1993 ke mumbai visphoton ke baad hue sampradayik dangon main shivasainikon ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai, jiske chalate sena-bijepi gathbandhan ko hindu vot jutaney main madad mili
 Bal Thackeray, who has the ability to understand the pulse of 'marathi Manus' very well, was a firm supporter of the saying that disrespect grows more closely and that is why he always described himself as the best
 tippaniyan He did not like to mingle and get close to his supporters and he used to see his supporters from the balcony of his highly guarded house 'matoshree'
 prasiddh dashahra reliyon main unke joshilay bhaashan sunne lakhon kii bheed umadti thi
 Bal Thackeray, who often targeted Pakistan and the Muslim community, once called the Muslim community even cancerous
 unhone kaha tha, islamic aatankwaad bad rahaa he or hindu aatankwaad hi iskaa jawaab dene kaa ekmaatr tarika he
 We need a suicide bomb squad to save India and Hindus
 baagh kii vividh chhaviyon ke saath singhaasana par baithne vaale thakare saalon tak maharashtra kii raajnneeti par chhaae rahe
 He had no position or position, but his influence was such that Matoshri received political leaders, film stars, sportspersons and industry personalities

 If you want to change 86 percent cash currency of the country, then a big part of it is necessary to keep it ready beforehand
 Looking at the situation every day, we are changing the strategy, it is not even a process that takes place in a few months, it takes much more time, so preparation should start much earlier
 sarkaar or arabiai taiyaar rahane par jor dete rahe hai
 Banks and atms are in large numbers for the distribution of notes, so not only should the preparation of printing be completed, but there should be a system to deliver and distribute them everywhere
 so, aap samaj sakate hai ki yah kitni badi prakriya he
 In this, along with maintaining confidentiality, it was also necessary to ensure that all the necessary information was received on time
 jab aap bahut badi aabaadi rakhte hai, to line to lagengi hi, lekin logon ne shandaar sahyog diya he
 There was no social tension in the country
 aap desh ko digital karency kii disha main le ja rahe hai, vahi ho rahaa he

 shesh kii jagah debit card or i-wolet istemaal honge
 After demonetisation, there will not be as much paper currency as before
 desh main samprati 23 karod i-wolet hai
 It is difficult to believe in politics and media, but the country is changing faster than we expected

 Where is Rahul Gandhi, this question was raised by BJP MP Ramesh Vidhuri in Lok Sabha from Delhi today
 vidhudi kaa kahana tha ki rahul gandhi rashtriya str ke netaa hai or desh ko yah jaanane kaa adhikaar he ki ve kahaan hai or kiske saath gaye hai
 Well, many people will be curious to know where Rahul is
 ab to patrakaron ne bhi kayaas lagaana chhod diya he
 On behalf of the BJP, when Haryana MP Ashwini Minna asked Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu that he also wanted to raise the question of where Rahul Gandhi is in the Lok Sabha, Venkaiah refused him
 sawaal uthta he bhala kyon? ab jaraa haal ke dinon main congress kii raajnneeti ko dekhie
 Rahul is no, the issue is about land acquisition and the opposition is plaguing the government with full force
 shuru main jab ye khabar ai thi, to laga tha ki congress shithil par jaaegi, kyanki senapati ke bina sena kya karegi
 But then court summons came against former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the coal block allocation case and it united the Congress
 sonia gandhi ne kaman sanbhali or apane netaaon ke saath manmohan singh ke ghar tak march kiya or manmohan singh par puraa bharosa jataayaa
 It was said from the Congress that the great lawyer of the country will advocate Manmohan Singh
 phir bhoomi adhigrahan par sansad ke andar or baahar sarkaar par hamalaa bolne ke liye congressi netaaon main hode lag gai
 Congress leaders have not hesitated to perform in front of the police and eat water canon at Jantar Mantar or Parliament Street rally
 jin netaaon ko aapane kabhi tivi par bolte nahin dekha hoga, wo jantar mantar par joshilay bhaashan de rahe hai yani congress ke sabhi netaaon ko andeshaa he ki congress kaa nizaam badalane vaala he or rahul kii bogi main baithne ke liye unhen jo seat chahie, uske rigerveshan ke liye sadakon par pasinaa bahaanaa jaruri he
 This is the reason why Rahul Gandhi did not miss anywhere in any protest or protest inside Parliament
 ulte iskaa asar or bhi adhik mahasoos kiya gaya
 Now the ground is ready in Congress for Rahul Gandhi
 ek vakt aisa lag rahaa tha ki party sonia or rahul camp main bant gai he, magar ab aisa lagata he ki congress ke netaaon ne rahul gandhi ke netritv ko sweekaar kar liya he, kyonki haal ke pherbadal bhi isi taraf ishaara kar rahe hai
 But the biggest question is when will Rahul come to the party and when will he be crowned
 pehle kaha ja rahaa tha ki april main hi congress kaa adhiveshan hoga, lekin sabko aadhikarik ghoshnaa kaa intjaar he
 However, despite Rahul not being in Delhi, the party has definitely left its impact in the people

 Standard SMS Charges Applicable Although people live in all places in the world, but almost everyone will agree that it is a different thing to live in a hostel
 hostel jahaan allhadpan basataa he, hostel jahaan tallent panapata he, hostel jahaan padhaaku chaatro ke saath-saath ladaaku or saamaajik-raajnneetik chaatr bhi hansi-khushi se rahete hai
 Hostels where you meet your intimate friends who remain your friends
 is baat se sabhi sahamat hote hai ki hostel ko jeevant banaae rakhane main vahaan ke hi chaatro kii bhoomika ko kahin se bhi khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Today we are providing you with some students who are hostels and lives of the hostel
 1
 Students who start to speak English after drinking alcohol: Although such people are everywhere, but there is hardly any agreement that all such students are trained in hostels
 do ghunt chadhaai nahin ki kabhi angreji na bolne vaali yah jamaat tuuti-phooti hi sahi magar apni fakkad andaaj main angreji bolne lagati he
 2
 jo padhane ke liye hi paidaa hue hai:aise ladke jo hostel main cameraa sirfapadhai ke liye hi alotkaraate hai
 They read so much that glasses and they become synonymous with each other
 3
 Such students who go on buying panga: Yes, such students of the hostel keep troubling the entire hostel, but sometimes the hostel is also due to them and such students are important part of the hostel
 4
 Students who have a bug in Netagiri: Students whose tongue is very fast
 chaahe hostel ke behatar khaane ke liye sangharsh karnaa ho yaa kahin bhi fees vruddhi par
 These can be seen everywhere
 jinaki jubaan par lohia, vivekanand or marks kii baaten hoti hai
 Those who are always in the mode of revolution
 5
 Students who are found only in the mess and the canteen: There are some such students in all the hostels which are found in the mess and canteen besides their rooms
 aise students jinka kitna bhi khaane ke baad pet nahin bharta
 6
 jo phone se hi chipke rahete hai:pehle to aise chaatr phone ko kaan se chipkaae rahete the lekinsmart phone or internetke aagaman ke baad aise chaatr din bhar phone kii screen par hi nazren tikaae rahete hai
 Waking up on the phone and sleeping on the phone is their favorite pastime

 ek dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal to duusare fasebuk ke sieo mark jakarberg
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the US Congress on Tuesday in the data leak case and apologized
 kejariwal bhi manahani ke maamalon main kai vipakshi netaaon se lagaataar maafee maang rahe hai
 In this case, Mark Zuckerberg's apology by mistake is being compared to the Kejriwal style
 aaie jaanate hai kab-kab mark jakarberg ne maangi maafee
 Confession mistake Cambridge Analytica, a firm that helped Donald Trump in the US presidential election, has been accused of stealing personal information from about 50 million Facebook users
 data li ke aarope lagane ke baad se fasebuk ke mark jakarberg bhi is maamle main kai deshon ke sansad or kanoon ke nishane par hai
 In such a situation, after coming out of this case, Mark first gave a clarification through a post on Facebook
 21 march ke unhone apane post main likhaa tha ki company ne is maamle main abhi tak kai kadam uthaae hai or aage bhi kade kadam uthaa sakati he
 Zuckerberg admitted his mistake in the case of Cambridge Analytica
 iske baad kuch dinon main mark jakarberg kii ore se or kuch post aae, jisamen galati sweekaar karte hue fasebuk kii ore se data ko or surakshit banane kaa vaada kiya gaya
 Zuckerberg, Zuckerberg, who kept avoiding apologizing even by speaking sorry, gave an interview to CNN, in which he said that there are many such things that it is not easy to solve such cases

 He admitted during the interview that there was a mistake from Facebook and it should have been rectified long ago
 mark jakarberg ne yahaan tak kaha ki hamaare paas yujar data ko bachaane kii jimmedaari he or agar ham aisa nahin kar sakate to ham aapke (yugers) ke laayak nahin hai
 Mark Zuckerberg said sorry and also said that the company had made a big mistake by giving users more data than its old website to app developers
 unka maananaa he ki cambridge analitica jaisi company par aankh band karke bharosa karnaa bhi ek galati thi
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was once again apologized for facing criticism in the British leaked case by advertising in British newspapers
 jakarberg ne britain ke sabhi akhabaaron main puure panne kaa vigyaapan nikaal maafee maangi
 In the advertisement, Zuckerberg wrote that it is our responsibility to keep your information safe, if we do not fulfill that responsibility then we are not fit to serve you
 jakarberg kii taraf se ye vigyaapan britain ke sabhi akhabaaron ke sande adishan main diya gaya he
 Apart from Britain, Zuckerberg's apology has been published in many American newspapers
 mark jakarberg ne vigyaapan main likhaa ki ek uniwarsity research ke dwaara ek aplication banaai gai, jiske jariye fasebuk ke kai yugers kaa data chori hua
 This was a betrayal of people's trust, i cannot do anything except apologize to all of you at this time
 lekin ham lagaataar ection le rahe hai or hamaari koshish he ki aage se aisa kabhi naa ho
 An apology was issued before appearing in the Senate
 Mark Zuckerberg met with senators before appearing in the US Congress
 saath hi data li maamle main maafinama bhi jari kiya
 This apology has been issued by the US House Energy and Commerce Committee
 somvaar ko congress ke liye jari likhit bayaan main fasebuk siio ne maafee maangi thi ki is soshal media network ne data missuj ko rokane liye zyada kuch nahin kiya
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the apology that he started Facebook, he is running it and that he is responsible for whatever happens there
 saath hi mark ne kaha ki fasebuk data ko surakshit karne ke liye or zyada nivesh karegaa or isse fasebuk aage bhi badhegaa, aisa unhen puraa vishwaas he
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned in his apology that advertisers and developers would never rise above Facebook's mission to connect with people
 congress main sweekaar kii galati, maangi maafibiti raat fasebuk ke siiomark jakarbaramerica congress ke saamne pesh hue or unhone dheron sawaalon ke jawaab die
 During this time, US senators asked him many sharp questions
 poochtacha ke dauraan ek baar phir mark jakarberg ne saarvajanik rup se maafee maangi
 Zuckerberg has apologized to users and the public many times before, but this is the first time in his career that he has appeared before the Congress
 sunwaayee main jakarberg ne apni company main logon kaa bharosa behaal karne kaa prayaas kiya
 He said, 'we did not take a sufficiently large view on our responsibilities and it was a big mistake
 ’’ jakarberg ne kaha ki yah meri bhul thi or mujhe iskaa afsos he, maine fasebuk shuru kiya , maine ise chalaaya or yahaan jo kuch hua, uske liye main jimmedaar hum
 Apart from this, the company also started alerting users that Cambridge Analytica collected their data
 ' is dauraan 44 senetters ne unase baari baari se sawaal puche
 All the questions were given 5 minutes to answer
 ye sunwaayee kareeb 5 ghante tak chali
 In future too, you can ask for forgiveness from Mahendra Kejriwal, Arun Jaitley, Gadkari, etc
 Many cases of defamation are going to end
 haalanki fasebuk ke siio mark jakarberg ke bare main aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 The European Union spokesman in Brussels has also received new information that 2 of the European Union
 7 million yugers ko is data scandle ne prabhavit kiya he
 Facebook has confirmed this
 saath hi britain ke sansad main bhi mark jakarberg ko sawaal jawaab karne ke liye bulaane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 India's IT minister Ravishankar Prasad had also said that Mark Zuckerberg could be summoned if he found evidence against Facebook in the data leak case
 aise main bharat, britain or duusare european desh mark jakarberg ko saman kar sakate hai or ve maafee maangate dikh sakate hai
 Apologies have been sought in other cases
 In early October 2017, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg publicly apologized for the negative effects of this social-media platform
 unhone kaha, iskaa istemaal logon ko ekajute karne ke bajaae unamem foot daalane ke liye kiya gaya, jiske liye unhen maaf kar diya jaae
 He wrote on his social media account, i apologize to those who have hurt me this year, and i will try to become better
 jis tarah mere kaam kaa istemaal logon main foot daalane ke liye kiya gaya, uske liye main maafee chahta hum, main behatar kaam karne kii koshish karuunga
 When the newsfeed feature was launched at the launch of Newsfeed, the apology was found by many to interfere with their privacy
 is par mark jakarberg ne post likhakar maafee maangi or kaha ki yah unki taraf se badi galati thi, logon ko isaki jaankaree advance main di jaani chahie thi
 Facebook had also created Beacons to track the accuracy of sauryusers across the web
 is feechar main sabhi ko unki ijaajat ke bagaiyr jod liya gaya tha
 Mark Zuckerberg also apologized for this
 fasebuk ne 2009 main Beacons ko by by kah diya
 In 2011, Facebook was accused of tricking users into privacy on the privacy issue when the Federal Trade Commission was charged
 is par fasebuk ke siio ne sidhe nahin maafee maangi thi lekin apni galati sweekaar karte hue fasebuk post jarur kiya tha
 Rohingya cases were viral photo stock full of wrong and violence sought Rohingya case Mafimyanmar the ngos sector
 aise main fasebuk ne apane unhen hataate hue apane system ko best bataate hue credit liya tha, haalanki baad main mark jakarberg ne us enjio se maafee maangi
 After this, it was revealed that Facebook came into action only after the NGO gave information about the case

 Opposition has come to the ground openly
 aaj 21 dalon kaa vipakshi morcha chunaav ayog se milakar 50 fisadi vivipat kii parchi ke milan kii maang karegaa
 In Delhi, the entire opposition front, including the Congress, is in action, and there has been a struggle on suspicion of tampering with the evms
 uttar pradesh ke mau, kannauj, gajipur main iviem ko lekar samarthak police se bhid gaye
 In this uproar over evms, the Congress has demanded immediate action from the Election Commission
 congress netaa rajeev shukla ne kaha ki chandauli, jhaansi, gajiabad, saaran, punjab se iviem ko lekar shikaayat aa rahi he
 There is growing suspicion of evms coming in the dark of night
 chunaav ayog ko logon kaa shaq dur karke karrwai kerani chahie
 Rajiv Shukla said that the delegation of all parties will meet the Election Commission today
 chunaav ayog ko tatkaal karrwai kerani chahie taaki logon or raajnneetik dalon kaa bharosa kaayam rahe
 He said that Exit Poll is entertainment

 Former Minister Rajiv Shukla said that we will tell the Election Commission what will happen if the VVPAT matches are not proved correct? a guideline should be issued for this
 rajeev shukla se pehle aam aadmi party ke sanjay singh ne bhi chunaav ayog se guideline kii maang kii he
 Rajeev Shukla said that Pranab Mukherjee ji is appreciating the commission, while paying attention to what he (pranab Mukherjee) has said to consider the process of appointment of Election Commissioner
 ham is prakriya main badlaav kii maang karte hai
 Rahul Gandhi had also raised questions on the Election Commission: Congress President Rahul Gandhi has also questioned the working style of the Election Commission
 beete dinon unhone twitor par likhaa tha, 'elactoral bond, iviem se lekar chunaav kaarykram se chhedchhad, namo tivi, modi kii sena bayaan ke baad ab yah kedarnath main drama
 All Indians have seen the Election Commission's surrender to Mr
 Modi and his gang
 chunaav ayog kaa kaam sirf darana or aadar karnaa he or kuch nahin
 ' pyaar kisi rishte kaa naam nahin balki ek ahsaas he
 There is neither a guarantee nor a formula for when, why, how, where and from whom it happens
 javed kii khata bas yahi thi ki usne pyaar kiya tha
 This feeling of love was for Javed, also for his girlfriend
 lekin mulk kii sarhad shaayad is prem ko nahin samajhati
 And also understand why the meaning of Akhir border is partition, boundary
 sarhadon ke paar pyaar karne kii khata or uski sajaa aapane filmi parde par jarur dekhi hogi
 The applause would be played and the song would also have a swing
 lekin asal jindagi parde se alag he
 Here love is punished and yes, like films here, in the end all is not well
 javed ne pyaar kiya or pyaar kii sajaa ke taur par usase uski jindagi ke beshkeemtee saadhe gyaarah saal chin liye gaye
 Mohabbat Tohmat was made and in love the traitor's color was dissolved from the country
 vah aashiq tha, lekin jamaane ke dastur ne use pakistani khufia agency iesai ke agent ke taur par salaakhon ke peeche dhakel diya
 This is the story of Javed of Rampur
 kahani un saadhe gyaarah varshon kii jo usne bina kisi kusur ke charadivari main kaate
 That journey to Karachi
 
 
 ek aam garib ghar main paidaa hua javed padhai bich main hi chhod tivi marammat kaa kaam sikh rahaa tha
 Javed was living with his parents and siblings
 us vakt javed kii umr kareeb 18 saal thi
 Then in 1999, there is a new twist in Javed's life
 vah apni maa ko unke rishtedaaron se milwane bhai-bahan ke saath pehali baar karachi, pakistan jane vaala tha
 In 1999, there was complete bitterness in indo-pak relations
 saal shuru hote hi donon mulkon kii seemaa par jabardast tanaav tha
 The terrorists in Pakistan were infiltrating the Indian border with the help of the Pakistani Army
 paak sena siachin par kabja karne kii sajeesh rach rahi thi or aise hi vakt main javed apane parivaar ke saath pakistan jane kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 The voice was heard on the phone for the first time, before going to Pakistan, Javed used to have many phone conversations at the relative's house in Karachi
 isi dauraan phone par ek aawaaj se use mohabbat ho gai
 That voice was from Mubina aka Gudiya, a distant relative of Javed living in Karachi
 gudiya kii mohabbat main guddu yani javed puri tarah giraftaar ho chukaa tha
 Javed finally arrives in Karachi in February 1999 after completing all the visa exercises
 uskaa gudiya se aamanaa-saamana hota he
 The two grow in love and Javed returns to Hindustan after a few months amid all the promises
 donon kii prem kahani iske baad paravaan chadhati he
 a series of cards and phones go on
 urdu or hindi ke bich panpa pyardonon ke pyaar main ek khaas baat yah thi ki javed ko urdu nahin aati or gudiya ko hindi
 Javed sought help from his two friends Taj Mohammad and Maqsood
 wo donon naa sirf uske liye gudiya ko urdu main khat likhte balki gudiya kaa urdu main likhaa khat bhi pard kar sunaate
 Meanwhile, Guddu is reunited in 2001 to meet Khas Gudiya
 wo gudiya se vaada karata he ki jaldi hi shaadi kar wo use hindustan le aayega
 Both of their families had no objection to this relationship
 
 
 
 And Guddu returned to Rampur after the story promised to marry Karvatgudiya
 tabhi 13 agast 2002 ko wo hota he jo na sirf guddu yani javed or uske ghar waalon balki puure rampur shahar ko chaunkaa detaa he
 The Uttar Pradesh STF or Special Task Force team picks up Javed and his two friends Taj Mohammad and Maqsood from Rampur
 bataaya jaataa he ki us us vakt javed dukaan par tivi marammat kar rahaa tha
 Three days after Javed was picked up by the police, suddenly the newspaper reports that ISI agent Javed was arrested along with two accomplices
 yah bhi bataaya jaataa he ki unke paas se bareli chhavnee army force kaa nakshaa baraamad kiya gaya he
 This news falls like a bomb on Javed's housemates, because till now he felt that Javed had been kidnapped by someone
 kore kaagaj par karavaaya gaya dastakhatjaved ke mutabik, use koi andaja nahin tha ki use uthaane vaale log koun hai or kahaan le ja rahe hai
 It is kept near Ghaziabad for two days
 is dauraan us par tamaam julm dhaae jate hai
 The blank paper is signed and the third police takes it to the Ganj police station of Rampur
 tab pehali baar javed or uske ghar waalon ko pataa chalata he ki javed agava nahin hua tha balki use saadi vardi main police uthaa kar le gai thi
 STF illegally detains Javed for the entire three days but does not show his arrest
 javed ke khilaaf deshadroh or desh ke khilaaf jang samet kai maamle darj kiye jate hai
 Along with this, he is charged with providing the intelligence related to the army to the ISI in Bareilly, Meerut, Dehradun and Roorkee
 estf javed ke paas se haath se bana bareli chhavnee kaa nakshaa bhi baramadagi ke taur par dikhaati he or daawa karti he ki wo nakshaa javed ne pakistan fax kiya tha
 Javed was accused that he used to send intelligence to Pakistan through code
 javed ke jariye karachi kii jane vaali kol ko bhi estf ne bataur saboot pesh kiya
 Alfaaz of love was described as a terrorist code word
 Actually Javed had two important reasons for being trapped
 pehla rampur se lagaataar karachi kol or doosraa urdu main likhaa lav letters
 The code word that the police mentioned was j and M
 yani javed or mubina
 Javed and his family were realizing for the first time that they would get such a punishment for falling in love with a Pakistani girl
 javed ke vakil mohammad jilaluddin kehete hai, 'saboot ke naam par photograph nakshaa pesh kiya gaya, jabaki javed chauthi paas he
 'about a month and a half after his arrest, another serious stream was planted on Javed
 us par pota laga diya gaya
 a law brought by the NDA government in 2002 that gave the investigative agency unrestrained authority over suspected terrorists
 javed ke pita mohammad shafiq kehete hai, 'pota lagate hi vakil ek lakh fees maangane lage
 'neighbors and relatives did Guddu of Kinaramrampur, now a traitor and ISI agent in the legal pages
 padosi chhodie apano ne bhi javed ke gharavaalon se kinaaraa kar liya
 Javed's case was transferred from Rampur to Moradabad Court
 ab har peshi par puraa parivaar rampur se muradabad jaataa
 Just an old father earning a house and a date in court
 vakt bitta ja rahaa tha
 On the other hand, the love of crossing the border due to which Javed had become an agent with Aashiq, that love also went away from him
 mubina se javed ke saare rishte lagbhag tut chuke the
 Whether or not Mubina received the news of Javed's arrest, she did not know
 court ne kiya reeha, lekin
 
 
 Time passed and the stage of justice continued to grow longer
 javed or saathiyon ke paas se jo diary or nakshaa mila tha uski jaanch se sabit ho gaya ki handriting javed kii nahin he
 Javed was cited as an ISI agent by citing the phone numbers of Pakistan, all those numbers also came out of common people in Pakistan
 lihaaja adaalat ne puure cese ko no avindence cese qaraar dete hue 18 janvari 2014 ko javed ko reeha kar diya
 But before this release, Javed had to spend eleven and a half long years in jail
 is dauraan uski choti bahan badi ho gai
 Three brothers got married
 maa-baap or umradraj ho gaye
 Police refuses to talk, UP Police does not want to talk about this case of Javed
 hamaari tamaam koshishon ke baavjood police ne baat karne se manaa kar diya
 Of course Javed is now free
 use rihaai mil chuki he
 But will that precious eleven and a half years of his life be able to return him? Will anyone be able to give him the past? Probably not
 kabhi nahin
 Even today, he has not forgotten, after spending eleven and a half years behind the hard walls of Lovegel, Javed has not forgotten his doll
 wo usase aaj bhi utani hi mohabbat karata he
 But yes, now he has lost the courage to go to Pakistan
 usne tay kiya he ki wo ab kabhi pakistan nahin jayega

 In such a situation, the courts of Jharkhand have set an example by initiating solar panels in district courts
 jharkhandaka khunti jila court desh kaa pehla aisa court he, jo saura urja se sanchalit he
 This 100 kw solar panel was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the past
 chaar civil court saura urja se sanchalitakhunti ke alaava gadwa, simdega hue sahibganj kii jila court main saura urja ke sanyantr lagaae gaye hai
 All these plants are 100–100 kw
 adaalaton main lage in sanyantron ko grid se bhi joda gaya he, taaki upyog ke baad bachi saura urja kaa istemaal grid main kiya ja sake
 Acting Chief Justice of the Jharkhand High Court, Justice DN Patel played a key role in setting up these plants
 itnaa hi nahin rajya kii paanch anya jila court bhi saal 2018 ke shuruyaat tak saura urja se jagamagaayengi
 These are Chatra, Jamtara, Deoghar, Ramgarh and Koderma
 in jila adaalaton main in sanyantron kii sthapana kaa kaam shuru ho gaya he
 Environmentalists will be able to stop carbon emissions, if the scientists believe that for the production of 100 kw power, about 7 lakh liters of diesel will be required annually
 vahiin inase kareeb 2000 ton carbon daai oxide yani CO2 kaa utsarjan vaataavaran main hoga
 About 3000 fully grown trees will be needed to convert these back to oxygen
 aise main agar rajya kii sabhi adaalaton main agar saura urja sanyantr laga die jaaen to paryaavaran or hariyaali ko kitna phayda hoga, iskaa sahaj andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 As such, the people are welcoming this step taken by the court in Jharkhand

 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri or trinmul congress kii pramukh mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) ne sonbhadra narsanhaar ko lekar bhartiya janata party (bijepi) par hamalaa bolaa he
 He (mamata Banerjee) said that the Uttar Pradesh government did not allow Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to visit Sonbhadra citing law and order but the BJP party delegation visited the Bhatpara area of west Bengal when there was curfew happened
 mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) ne patrakaron se kaha ki main priyanka gandhi ko hiraasat main liye jane kii ninda karti hum
 Whatever happened was wrong
 sonbhadra main daliton par atyaachaar hone kii ghatnaayen hui hai or agar koi iske khilaaf aawaaj uthaa rahaa he, to unhen aisa karne kii anumati di jaani chahie
 He said that our government had allowed a three-member delegation of BJP to go to Bhatpara despite Section 144 of the crpc being implemented, but the party paid no heed to the advice of the administration and violated the law and went there with 50 vehicles
 priyanka chaar logon ko apane saath le gai thim or mujhe lagata he ki teen yaa chaar logon ko hameshaa anumati di jaani chahie
 We did the same in Bhatpara
 ham logon ko rokte nahin hai lekin bijepi aisa karte hai or phir hamaare bare main jhooth failaate hai
 Mamta Banerjee said that the law and order situation of Uttar Pradesh is very bad, saying that i have been told that more than 1,100 encounters (in Uttar Pradesh) have taken place and there are incidents of beating and beating every day
 in par gaur kiya janaa chahie
 Banerjee targeted Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for going late to the victims of the Sonbhadra incident
 unhone kaha ki maine suna ki adityanath sonbhadra (ravivaar ko) ja rahe hai
 i think they should have gone soon
 sonbhadra main jo hua he, vah sahi nahin he
 Significantly, the Uttar Pradesh government did not allow Priyanka Gandhi to go to Sonbhadra
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ke is ravaiye ke khilaaf jab priyanka gandhi dharne par baithi to unhen hiraasat main le liya gaya
 After this she stayed at Chunar Guest House in Mirzapur for many hours
 or kaha kii jab tak main peedit parivaar se mil nahin leti tab tak yahaan se nahin jaaoongi
 The Uttar Pradesh government had to bow to Priyanka's demand and finally met two relatives of the victims of the Sonbhadra massacre at the Chunar Guest House
 sonbhadra hatyakand ke peediton ke 2 rishtedaaron se mirzapur ke chunaar guest house main milane ke baad priyanka gandhi ne kaha he ki unka makasad puraa ho gaya he
 He said that he is still in custody
 ab prashasan kaa kya kahata he ki yah dekhte hai
 At the same time, he also said that Rs 10 lakh will be provided by the Congress to the victim's family whose people were killed in this massacre
 vahiin mirzapur ke dm kii ore se bayaan aayaa he ki priyanka gandhi puri tarah se aaazaad hai, na unako hiraasat yaa giraftaar kiya jayega yaa kisi tarah kaa muchalaka bharna hoga
 On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma has said that after the imposition of Section 144, if someone goes to fulfill the political objective then it is not right
 kisi ko bhi samvedshil muddon par raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie
 On the other hand, apart from four TMC mps going to Sonbhadra, Deepender Hooda of Congress, Mukul Wasnik, Raj Babbar, Jitin Prasad, Rajiv Shukla have been detained at Varanasi Airport
 aapako bataa den ki sonbhadra main jameen kabja karne ke gaye ek paksh ne duusare paksh par hamalaa kar diya jisamen 10 logon kii maut ho gai
 After this, the Yogi government came under attack from the opposition
 isse pehle priyanka gandhi wadra ko prashasan dwaara roke jane kii prishthbhumi main congress ne shanivaar ko rajya kii yogi adityanath sarkaar main ''jangal raaj '' hone or adivaasiyon kii ''sansthagat hatya'' kiye jane kaa aarope lagaaya or sawaal kiya ki aakhir sarkaar priyanka se dari hui kyon he
 Party's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told reporters, "sonbhadra's genocide is against the poor and farmers of the country
 ye hatyaein sansthagat maani jaaen
 "instead of giving justice to the victims, the government of Ajay Singh alias Adityanath is engaged in suppressing the leaders of opposition parties," he said
 priyanka ji kaa kasoor itnaa hi he ki vah peediton se milanaa or unke aansu ponchna chaahati thim
 "surjewala said," Umbha, the village of the aggrieved tribals, was made a police camp
 kisi ke aane jane par roak laga di gayi he
 Are there terrorists and extremists there? "he claimed," The Adityanath government on 19 October 2017 gave the tribal land to the main accused
 yogi sarkaar adivaasiyon kii jameen par kabja karwaanaa chaahati he
 Several firs were registered against the tribal farmer
 adivaasiyon ne jiladhikari ke paas aavedan kiya lekin koi sunwaayee nahin hui
 "he said," What is this, if not the conspiracy of the Adityanath government? The truth is that Adityanath government is giving protection to criminals
 vah sonbhadra main aparaadhiyon ke saath khadi he
 He said that we will take all possible steps to bring justice to the victims of the massacre
 surajevaala ne yah sawaal bhi kiya, "kya puure umbha gaanv (sonbhadra) ko police chhavnee main badal kar sach dabaa paaegi adityanath sarkaar? bhaajapa sarkaar ko priyanka gandhi se dar kyon lagata he?'' gauratlab he ki priyanka ko shuukravaar ko sonbhadra jane se prashasan ne roak diya
 She was going to meet the families of the victims of this mass murder on Wednesday
 priyanka prashasan ke is kadam ke virodh main dharne par baith gayi
 He was later taken to the Chunar Guest House
 shanivaar subah peedit pariwaron ke kuch log khud vahaan pahunche or priyanka se mili
 Recently in a land dispute in Sonbhadra, a village headman along with his supporters allegedly opened fire on the other side, killing 10 people and injuring several others

 kalavati tak ko abhi tak koi laabh nahin hua, jiske yahaan kaaphi pehle rahul gaye the
 He described Rahul's comparison of this padyatra with Mahatma Gandhi's 'dandi Yatra' as 'indecent'
 bhaajapa pravaktaa ne aarope lagaaya ki congress or basapa ‘‘match phixing’’ kiye hue hai
 He said this is evident from the fact that whenever needed, the BSP supports the Congress at the Center

 yah mudda haal main jediu netaa nitish kumaar ne apane har jile ke sampark yatra main uthaaya tha or har jagah vah ramdev ke bayaan or narendra modi dwaara kaledhan par die gaye bhaashanon ko sunaate the
 Sushil Modi clarified that the meaning of what Narendra Modi said was that if black money is returned, then 10 to 15 lakh rupees can be deposited in every poor account in the country
 darasal, bihar bijepi pareshaan he ki nitish kumaar apni har baithak main kaledhan ke mudde par na keval ramdev, balki narendra modi ke bhaashanon kaa ansh sunaate hai
 The BJP fears that repeated propaganda of this issue may create an atmosphere against the BJP

 While drinking lime in the paan, the paan said, "madam leaders wear caps to the public every time
" is baar bazaar main thodi zyada tapiyaan hai
 But putting on a hat does not mean support
 ham to chauraahey par baithe hai jo party aati he vahi topi pahana detii he
 Around four-five kilometers from Banaras Cantt railway station, a group of five-six children were roaming around at Pandeypur intersection, carrying flags of different parties, wearing caps
 poocha yah kiski topi or kiskaa jhanda he
 The children shrieked and then said
 hamaara he
 Father was brought inhen dekhakar aisa lag rahaa tha maanon gathbandhan kii raajnneeti kaa bal swaroop jeevant ho uthaa ho
 However, there was no pull like the coalition formed by real political parties
 bair nahin tha, koi dwesh nahin tha
 It was a game
 khayr baat tapiyon se shuru hui thi, to bataate chalem ki jo log sadakon par alag-alag partiyon kii topi pahane dikhaai de rahe hai
 He is not necessarily a supporter of those parties
 haalanki kuch logon ne modi ke topi na pahanane par khub hallaa machaaya
 Said Modi is anti-muslim
 dekhie pramaan mil gaya
 Modi also replied in an interview in Bollywood form
 main sabhi dharmon kaa sammaan karata hum, lekin apane dharm kaa paalan
 Something similar is written in the Ashoka Pillar
 sabhi sampradaayon kaa sammaan na karne se apane dharm kaa asar kam hota he
 Therefore it seems that the script of this dialogue of Modi has been written on the basis of this sermon itself in the Ashoka Pillar
 khayr isamen koi buraai nahin he
 Because it is a good thing to quote the sentences of a philosopher or preacher or a scholar in order to bring weight in things

 After seeing the man, the accused escaped from there, but the guards chased him for about 2 kilometers and caught him
 ye vaardaat dilli ke kirti nagar ilaake kii he
 The accused first entered inside an ATM machine
 uske paas koi bhi atm card nahin tha
 He had a device which he tries to place where the ATM card is installed
 wo ye divayees laga hi rahaa tha ki tabhi ek shaks atm ke andar aa gaya
 As soon as he came, the accused went to the other side and soon after that he went back to his work

 Al Qaeda: Al Qaeda has been splattering since the rise of ISIS
 kuch samay pehle al kaayda ne bharat main shakha kholane kaa jo elaan kiya tha, vah iesas se mili chunauti kaa hi parinaam tha
 Second, al Qaeda has also carried out such attacks
 haalanki, al kaayda kii bhoomika ke pukhta saboot milane abhi baaki hai or agar aisa he to yah iesas ke khilaaf al kaayda kaa yah khulaa elaan hoga or phir duniya kai or hamale jald dekhegi

 However, there was no response in this regard from the Chief Minister's residence, located just a short distance from Lalu's house

 Lalu's supporters say that Lalu's opposition to 'saheb' is not politically appropriate due to Shahabuddin's influence in areas around Siwan
 ullekhneey he ki shahabuddin ko is ilaake main 'sahib' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Therefore, Lalu Prasad did not openly support the move when Nitish Kumar moved the Supreme Court in the case of Shahabuddin's bail

 This also increased his distance with Nitish

 Although there have been reports of disagreement between the two on several key issues in the past, Lalu says that the opposition BJP wants to damage his alliance with Nitish by distorting the facts
 unke is daawey ko bijepi ke sir thikra phodne kii kavayad ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 It is believed that Nitish Kumar was angry with Lalu Prasad on the issue of Mo Shahabuddin
 darasal jail se bel par reeha hone ke baad mo shahabuddin ne kaha tha ki nitish kumaar to ''paristhitiyon ke mukhyamantri hai''
 Lalu Prasad took silence on this comment

 lalu ke samarthakon kaa kahana he ki siwan ke aas-paas ke kshetron main shahabuddin ke rasookh ke chalate lalu kaa 'sahib' kaa virodh siyaasi lihaaj se upyukt nahin he
 It is worth mentioning that Shahabuddin is also known as 'saheb' in this area
 isiilie nitish kumaar ne shahabuddin kii bel rad karaane ke maamle main supreme court kaa rukh kiya to lalu prasad ne is kadam kaa khule taur par samarthan nahin kiya
 In contrast, Lalu told a senior leader of Nitish's JDU that "why is the Chief Minister taking so fast to send Shahabuddin back to prison" even though he has already spent 11 years in jail
 is baat se bhi unki nitish ke saath duuri badi thi
 Lalu Prasad personally disagrees with the Chief Minister even in the case of prohibition

 He said that hundreds of cows are dying every day in the state
 bijepi gaay ke naam par sirf raajnneeti karti he, lekin congress gaay ko tadapate hue nahin dekh sakati
 Therefore, the cows roaming the streets will be opened in the cowshed at the panchayat level so that they do not become victims of accident
