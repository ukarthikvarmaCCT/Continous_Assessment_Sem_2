 The police officer said that the bodies of both have been sent for post-mortem
 apni mul party main phir se aane kaa man bana rahe uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri kalyaan singh kaa bhaajapa swaagat karne ke mood main nahin he, jabaki madhyapradesh kii purv mukhyamantri uma bharti ko waapas liya ja saktaa he
 BJP sources said that Kalyan Singh has lost the scope of return twice leaving his parent party but the same cannot be said about Uma
 inkaa kahana he ki kalyaan ne party chhodane ke baad alag vichaardhaara vaali sapa se haath milaayaa lekin uma bhaajapa kii mul vichaardhaara se nahin hati hai
 They say that when Kalyan left the BJP and joined hands with SP leader Mulayam Singh, he even apologized for his role in the demolition of Babri Masjid
 sapa dwaara thukraa die jane par ab vah phir se ayodhya main bhavy ram mandir banane kii baat kar rahe hai, lekin iskaa koi laabh unhen nahin milegaa
 Sources said that after coming back to the party this year, before the Lok Sabha elections, he again left the BJP and joined hands with Mulayam even though the party had announced to make him its candidate from Etah
 aisa karke unhone party kii baari fajihat kii he isliye aam raay yah he ki bhaajapa main unka swaagat nahin kiya jaae
 It is being said, however, that Kalyan's son Rajbir may be taken into the party after some time due to Kalyan's entry into the backward states of Uttar Pradesh
 bataaya jaataa he ki laalkrishna adwani or rajnath singh, donon hi kheme kalyaan ko party main waapas lene ke icchhuk nahin hai
 After being removed from the post of party president, Rajnath Singh wants to focus his attention in Uttar Pradesh and he would not like Kalyan Singh to get a place in the party again to challenge him
 mulaayam singh se haath milaane ke kaaran rashtriya swayamsevak sangh bhi kalyaan ko parivaar se baahar hi rakhana chahta he
 The party leadership believes that Kalyan has lost his charisma and influence
 yahaan tak ki lodh vot bank par bhi unki pakad nahin rah gai he
 His son Rajbir's defeat in the Atrauli seat, which is considered a stronghold of Kalyan in the 2007 assembly elections, is being presented as a proof of this
 uttar pradesh ke pichley vidhansabha chunaav main kalyaan kii aguwai main bhaajapa ne chunaav ladaa tha or unhen mukhyamantri ke daavedaar ke rup tak main pesh kiya gaya tha
 Despite this, the party's performance was very disappointing
 party sutron ne bataaya ki kuch samay baad rajbir or uma bharti ko party main liya ja saktaa he
 Indicating his desire to return to the BJP, Uma has expressed his desire to make his Bharatiya Janashakti Party a part of the NDA

 Dineshwar Sharma, a negotiator appointed by the central government to negotiate the Kashmir issue, reached Srinagar on Monday
 vahiin, mukhya vipakshi dal congress ne sharma ke ghati ke daure ko lekar kai sawaal uthaae hai
 Congress Communication Department chief Randeep Surjewala said in a conversation with Aaj Tak that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government have no policy on Kashmir
 surajevaala ke mutabik sarkaar ko ye saaf karnaa he ki vaartakar ke naate ghati gaye sharma ke kaary kshetra or adhikaar kshetra kya hai?surajevaala ne kaha ki ham baatcheet ke khilaaf nahin hai lekin sarkaar ko ye saaf karnaa he ki pakshakaar koun hai? pradhanmantri ne kin pakshakaron ko adhikrut kiya he? baatcheet kaa str kya he or baatcheet ke adhikaar kshetra ko lekar kya sthiti he?modi sarkaar kii manshaa par sawaal uthaate hue congress ke mukhya pravaktaa surajevaala ne kaha, 'is sarkaar ne naa tovartakar sharmaaki bhoomika or adhikaar kshetra ko saaf kiya he or naa pakshakaron ko paribhaashit kiya he
 In the absence of all this, what kind of conversation would happen except for the opportunity to be photographed? Is this the objective of the government? ”sharma said that as a special representative of the central government in Jammu and Kashmir, during the visit of the valley, all parties will contact and try to start the process of dialogue in the valley
 algaavvaadi sanghathanpahale hi sharma ke daure ko lekar thanda rukh dikhaate hue baatcheet se alag rahane kaa elaan kar chuke hai
 Surjewala said that we are not against the talks, we want to see normalcy restored
 desh ke samvidhan ke daayre main rahete hue har us paksh se baat kii jaani chahie jo prabhavit he
 There can be no talk to any person or organization outside the scope of the constitution
 ek inch par bhi samjhauta nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The government has neither clarified the role of negotiations nor defined the parties
 ise kyon nahin saarvajanik kiya ja rahaa? ise top sikret banaakar kyon rakhaa ja rahaa he?surajevaala ne modi sarkaar par kashmir ko lekar koi spasht niti nahin rakhane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Surjewala said that the tragedy is that the Modi government has no policy, no direction nor vision to move towards restoring normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir
 sach ye he ki hamaare jawan, hamaare sipaahi mathrubhumi kii raksha ke liye shahid ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, the basic question is what is the policy and what is the way forward? hind sahasaagar ke ek chattani hisse main do pahari chotiyon ke bich jhulati ek rassi par kartab dikhaanaa korali jirolt ko baari padane vaala tha, or uski jaan lagbhag chali hi gai thi
 
 
 But it is said that no, Rakhe Saiyan 
 
 reunion island main do chotiyon ke bich lagbhag 31 meter kii duuri ko rassi par chalate hue paar karne kaa dhadakanon ko roak dene vaala karnama karti korali jirolt jab rassi ke bich pahunchi, achaanak samudr ashaant ho gaya, or praan sukha dene vaali oonchi-oonchi lehren uthne lageen
 The comments video main saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki khatarnaak rup akhriyaar karti ja rahi samudri laharon ke bich korali behad bhayaavah sthiti main rassi par apana santulan banaae rakhane kii koshish kar rahi he ki tabhi lagbhag 40 foot oonchi ek lahar behad khatarnaak gati se use apni chapet main le leti he, or puri tarah 'leel' jaati he
 After Coralie Jireault is swallowed by the wave, each viewer's breath is on the verge of stopping, as the balance of his friend shooting the video also worsens, and the camera starts to move, as the effect of the wave hits that rock
 Till happened, on which she is shooting while standing
 lekin kuch hi pal ke baad jab lahar shant hokar neeche gir jaati he, korali rassi par maujuud nazar aane lagati he, or saans main saans aati he
 It can be clearly seen in the video that amidst the sea waves taking dangerous form, Coralie is trying to maintain her balance on the rope in a very frightening situation when a wave of about 40 feet high catches her at a very dangerous speed She takes it, and goes completely 'lil'
 korali jirolt ke lahar dwaara nigal liye jane ke baad har dekhne vaale kii saans ekadam rukne kii kagaar par pahunch jaati he, kyonki video shoot kar rahi uski mitra kaa bhi santulan bighad jaataa he, or camera hilne lagata he, kyonki lahar kaa asar us chattan tak hua, jis par khadi hokar vah shooting kar rahi he
 But after a few moments when the wave calmly falls down, Coralie starts to appear on the rope, and breathes in breath
 lekin kuch hi pal ke baad jab lahar shant hokar neeche gir jaati he, korali rassi par maujuud nazar aane lagati he, or saans main saans aati he
 Bharti Airtel has a plan of Rs 549
 jo reliance jeeyo ke nae 509 rupee vaale plan kii tarah hi he, jise kal hi pesh kiya gaya
 Airtel's Rs 549 plan is valid for all Airtel prepaid customers
 isamen 28 dinon kii validity ke saath pratidin 3GB data diya jaataa he
 That is, Airtel will provide a total of 84GB of data during the entire validity period
 puri tarah se is plan ko dekhen to airtel ab is plan main pratidin3gb data, analimited wais kol or pratidin 100SMS de rahaa he
 Similarly, if you see this plan with the revised 509 rupees plan of Reliance Jio, then Jio is also providing 3GB data per day and includes calling and SMS
 pehle jeeyo is plan main 49 dinon ke liye pratidin 2GB data muhaiyaa karaata tha, lekin company ne kal is plan main badlaav kiya
 With this, this plan became like Airtel
 airtel ne disambar 2017 main 549 rupee vaale plan ko apadet kar pratidin 2
 From 5GB data was increased to 3GB data per day
 haalanki donon hi plan kii validity 28 dinon kii he
 But the important thing is that this plan of Jio is slightly cheaper than Airtel
 iske alaava jeeyo ke chote richarge kii baat karen to company ke paas 19 rupee, 52 rupee or 98 rupee ke plance hai
 The validity of the plan with 19 rupees is 1 day and 0 in it
 15GB data diya jayega, 52 rupee vaala plan 7 dinon ke liye valid hoga, jisamen1
 05GB will go to Datadia and the validity of the Rs 98 plan will be 14 days, of which 2
 1GB data diya jayega
 Unlimited calls, subscription of Jio apps and SMS will also benefit in these plans

 (input bhashaa se) The Marathwada region of Maharashtra is witnessing an outbreak of drought
 kai bade jalashay sookhte ja rahe hai
 There was already a shortage of irrigation water, now drinking water also seems to be in trouble
 aurangabad main godavari nadi par bana jaikawadi baandh do zilon aurangabad or jaalnaa kii pani kii sari zaruuratein puri karata he - peyajal, sinchai or udyog tak ke liye yaheen se pani jaataa he
 But in March this year, there was not enough water left in this reservoir to be used
 ausatan is samay par is jalashay main pani kaa str kshamta kaa 30% hota he jo is saal 31 march tak ghatakar shunya par rah gaya he
 Last year, the water level was 13 percent at this time
 central water kamishan ke chairmen jies jha ne enditivi se kaha, "baandh main pani kaa str shunya par girane kaa matlab he ki is baandh main ab istemaal ke laayak pani nahin bachaa he jo chintaa kii baat he"
 The same situation is with the Yaldari dam of Parbhani
 teen zilon ko pani dene vaale is baandh main kaam laayak bas 4% pani rah gaya he
 Last year, the water level was 14 percent
 jabaki marathavada ilaake ke isapur baandh main pichley saal pani kaa str 31% tha jo 31 march ko ghatakar 14% rah gaya he
 There has been no rain in the area for three years, crops are getting worse, it is becoming difficult to get drinking water

 The Jaikwadi dam on the Godavari river in Aurangabad caters to all the water needs of the two districts of Aurangabad and Jalna - this leads to water for drinking water, irrigation and industry
 lekin is saal march main hi is jalashay main itnaa pani nahin bachaa ki use kaam main laayaa ja sake
 On average, the water level in this reservoir at this time is 30% of the capacity, which has come down to zero till 31 March this year
 pichley saal is samay pani kaa str 13 fisadi tha
 The Central Water Commission chairman GS Jha told NDTV, "the water level in the dam has fallen to zero which means that there is no useable water left in this dam which is a matter of concern"
 yahi haal parabhani ke yaldari baandh kaa he
 The dam, which provides water to three districts, has only 4% water to be used
 pichley saal yahaan pani kaa str 14 fisadi tha
 Whereas the Isapur Dam in Marathwada area had a water level of 31% last year which has come down to 14% as on 31 March
 ilaake main teen saal se barish nahin hui he, fasalein lagaataar karaab ho rahi hai, pine kaa pani milanaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Farmers are now requesting help from the government

 The on-field umpires felt that the ball hit the wicket after hitting Karthik's pad and gave Sangakkara a not out, but when Munaf and Harbhajan protested, they consulted the third umpire and called Sangakkara out
 sangakaara ne 19 gend kii apni pari main ek chauke kii madad se 14 ran banaae
 Christian then teamed up with White to speed up the run

 N
 das ne bataaya ki jila mukhyalay main yojit ek kaarykram ke dauraan 23naksaliyone police ke samaksh aatmasamarpan kar diya he
 The Naxalites who surrendered include three Janmillia commanders, one Jan Militia deputy commander, four DAKMS members, 10 Jan Militia members and five Sangham members
 police adheekshak das ne bataaya ki aatmasamarpan karne vaale naksaliyon main janamilicia commander kamalesh naag, janamilicia commander tulsi ram naag or jan milicia platoon commander naresh kumaar kashyap ke sir par ek-ek lakh rupe kaa inam ghoshit he
 The police officer said that all the Naxalites who surrendered have ration cards and Aadhaar cards, while four Naxalites have Indira Awas and 20 Naxalites have voter ID cards and 14 Naxals have bank accounts
 police ke mutabik shaskeey dastavej rakhane kaa kaaran yah he ki jo bhi nichle str ke naksali hai, vah sthaneey naksali hai or yah deshi hathiyaar lekar ghoomte hai
 Local Naxalites are the biggest strength of Naxalites
 police chaahati he ki sthaneey naksali aatmasamarpan karen or police ke saath milakar bahari naksaliyon kaa muqabla karen
 Das said that many social organizations allege that the police also surrender tribals who are not Naxalites
 lekin isse saaf ho rahaa he ki naksali bhi shashan dwaara jari dastavej rakhte he jo unki ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 The police officer said that the members of the surrendered Naxalite organization are being given ten thousand rupees by the government as an incentive

 After the swearing-in of Narendra Modi, the JDU has an indirect conflict with the BJP
 is baar modi sarkaar main jediu ne koi bhi mantri pad nahin liya he
 After this, the president of Janata Dal United (JDU) and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar expressed in gestures that the party is angry with the BJP
 unhone kaha, media main aisi report aa rahi he ki ham 3 siton kii maang kar rahe hai jo saraasar galat he
 Talking to journalists after landing at Patna Airport, Nitish Kumar clearly said that he hoped that on the basis of strength of numbers, BJP will give allies a place in the Council of Ministers but this did not happen
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki shapath grahan se pehle unhone bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or bihar bijepi prabharee upendra yadav se mulaakaat ke dauraan is baat kaa prastaav rakhaa tha ki sankhya ke aadhaar par sahyogi dalon ko mantriparishad main jagah milani chahie magar aisa nahin hua
 Not wanted Minister Padneetish said that he wanted the Council of Ministers to be divided on the basis of the number of NDA constituents in Bihar or the number of NDA constituents at the national level
 nitish ne kaha ki jediu ko sankethik taur par ek mantri pad dena party ke anya netaaon ko nagavar gujara
 So the party decided that we do not want a single ministerial post
 haalanki nitish ne bijepi ko khari-khoti sunaate hue yah bhi kah diya ki modi mantrimandal main sammanjanak sankhya nahin milane se vah niraash hataash nahin he balki unki party bijepi ke saath khadi he
 Annoyed with the BJP, the BJP will also decide to do whatever it wants, even if in the future, if the Narendra Modi cabinet expands and his party gets an invitation to join the cabinet, his party will not join it
 baat saaf he ki nitish ne saaf sanket de die hai ki sarkaar ke shuruyaat main mantrimandal main jagah nahin milane se ve aahat hai or bhavishya main agar jadyu ko modi sarkaar main shaamil hone kaa mauka miltaa he to bhi vah aisa nahin karenge
 Attacking the BJP, Nitish Kumar has been taunting again and again and said that this time he has got a great majority, so he can decide whatever he wants
 nitish kumaar ne kaha, ''hamen sankethik pratinidhitiv kii jarurat nahin he
 When i was told that a minister would be given to JDU, i said we should not
 lekin main is bare main apni party ke sadasyon se baatcheet karuunga
 When we are together, we do not need any kind of symbolic participation
 ham bijepi se naaraaz nahin hai
 Earlier, JDU leader KC Tyagi had said that the reason behind not joining Modi's cabinet is not resentment
 is maamle main amit shah se baatcheet ho rahi he
 a decision will be taken only after negotiations
 kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki zyada mantri pad kii maang par adane kii baat galat he
 Nitish Kumar came to Delhi on May 28, after which he spoke to Amit Shah
 unhone kaha ki hamane sabhi sahyogi partiyon kaa pratikatmak pratinidhitiv tay kiya he
 On 28 May, Nitish Kumar disagreed that the JDU was not ready for symbolic representation
 kasee tyaagi ne kaha, yah faisla nitish kumaar ne party ke varisht sadasyon se baatcheet or party kii sansadeey samiti se baatcheet ke baad liya
 All the party representatives who were in Delhi said that the party is not ready for symbolic representation
 na nitish kumaar ne aaaraseepi singh kaa naam diya, na hi kushvaha kaa, na hi lalan singh kaa
 When we are not ready for symbolic representation, there is no question of suggesting someone's name
 media main chal raheen sabhi khabaren galat hai
 Before the swearing-in of Narendra Modi, jdu's dispute with BJP had come to the fore
 darasal, is baar modi sarkaar main jediu ne koi bhi mantri pad nahin liya he
 After which Janata Dal United (JDU) leader KC Tyagi says that its impact will be seen on the Bihar assembly elections
 darasal, jediu kii maang thi ki unke cote se teen mantri hone chahie, lekin bijepi kii taraf se unhen 1 hi mantri pad ofer kiya gaya
 Nitish Kumar wanted RCP Singh and Lallan Singh to be made Union Ministers and Santosh Kushwaha got the status of Minister of State
 nitish kumaar agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar jatigat sameekaran baitaane kii koshish main lage hai
 But this could not happen

 It is being told that the clothes of both Sameera and Akshay have been designed by Neeta Lalla
 samira ko bhi bikes kaa shauk he
 She was driving a modified bike of Akshay's company
 phir ek din vah akshay se milin or donon main dosti ho gai
 But on why the wedding is being held in January instead of April, a friend of Sameera told that this year, Akshay wants to expand his business, so he will be quite busy
 isliye donon ne tay kiya ki janvari main hi shaadi kar lee jaae

 dilli main ye project ek payalat ke rup main shuru kiya gaya he
 After its success, it will also be launched in Kolkata, Pune, Chandigarh, Mumbai, Bangalore
 is project se judi kuch khaas bate hai:1
 In this, girls will be given training for driving 7 months of commercial vehicles such as buses, taxis, their age should be between 17 to 40 years
 2
 They must be from the family of sanitary workers
 har maheene inhen 1500 rupee milenge or sabase khaas baat apni suraksha or maansik shanti ke liye inhen judon-karate or yoga kii bhi training di jaaegi

 unke paas mere sawaalon ko koi jawaab nahin tha
 He was only talking about hindu-muslim during the entire show
 vah baar-baar kah rahe the ki aap har channel par mahila hone kaa ronaa roti hai
 During the debate he called me Mentally Il

 com There is hardly any house in India where people believe in Hinduism, there is no Goddess worship
 kashmir se kanyakumari tak or arunachal pradesh se lekar kuccha ke ran tak har kahin devi kii upasna kaa alag -alag mahatv he
 And all the Goddesses in this country and there are stories of their worship, their head is definitely met by going through the major books of Hindus
 hinduon ke dharmagrandhon main aesekisson kii koi kami nahinjo hinduon kii devi or unki divine shaktiyon kaa ullekh na karti ho
 But there are very few such incidents, which are prominently mentioned in the event of the degeneration of the goddesses or unknowingly to them or their sin
 kisi bhi dharm pustak main aisa kahin bhi likhaa hua nahin miltaa ki koi devtaa ye var kisi ko bhi nahin dete ki purushon ko striyon ke upar shashan karnaa chahie
 Hindustan is also perhaps the only country in the whole world where the devas as well as the idols of the goddesses are given a powerful and respectful place in the world
 tab ye sawaal khadaa hota he ki aakhir ye hindu samaaj pitrusattatmak kyon he? kyon hindu ke vyavasthanirdharakon ne striyon ko kamini ke rup main hi kyon dekha?kyon aisa kaha ki maaya se bachanaa chahie?puranic vishyon ke jaankaar or apane shodh ko lekhan ke jariye pathakon tak pahunchane vaale jane maane visheshgy devdatt patnayak ne apni nai pustak bharat main devi anant naritv ke paanch swarup main aise hi jatil prashnon ko na sirf uthaaya
 Rather, they have also tried to find answers through the recognized books of Hindus
 puranic kathaon or kivdantiyon ke shodh se devdatt patnayak ko is nattejey par pahunchane main safalataa mili he ki is mulk main jitani bhi deviyon kii puja archana kii jaati he, un sabhi kii utpatti paanch pramukh swarupon se hi hui he
 The first form of the goddess is considered to be of nature, while in the second form, the goddess is seen as a mother, which has Mamta

 In Australia, India are already trailing 0-2 in the ODI series, but the team has become number one in Tests

 The English team has 104 points after taking a 2–0 lead in the series
 england bhale hi siries kaa chauthaa or aakhri test jite yaa haare, isse team india kii ranking par koi fark nahin padegaa
 India will remain the number one team in the Test rankings
 bhartiya team, apni jameen par 4 match kii test siries main africa team ko 3-0 se haraakar test main number 2 team bani thi
 Earlier, Team India became the number one team in Tests in December 2009, led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni

 At that time too, Team India had removed South Africa from the number one position

 With the help of the air of two wings under the white canopy, there has been a war against discrimination in the examination of IAS with Indian languages
 isi tarah kaa andolan elahabaad, varanasi, jaipur or hyderabad se bhi uth rahaa he
 They demand that the Civil Services Common Aptitude Test (CISET) be removed from the preliminary examination of the Public Service Commission of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), because Hindi, which has been successful in the IAS examination since then, has been introduced in 2011
 And there has been a sharp decline in the number of students in the rest of the Indian linguistic medium
 chaatr yah sangharsh kab se kar rahe hai or inkaa dard kitna gaharaa he, isaki nabj tatolane se pehle jaraa siset kii charchaa kar len
 In fact, till 2011, there were two papers in the prelims exam of the Civil Service - the first paper was for the main subject of the student and the second one was for General Studies
 2011 main mukhya vishay ke parche ko hataakar siset yani aptitude kaa parchaa daal diya gaya
 Says Angesh Kumar, who is leading the movement, "10 per cent of the questions in the Aptitude Guide are in English, which is very difficult
" iske alaava sawaalon kaa hindi anuwaad itnaa jatil he ki mahapandit rahul sankrutyaan bhi shaayad hi ise samaj saken
 If you look at the old pages, it includes the 'tablet computer', the Hindi translation of the 'tablet computer', the English term 'go and no go zone' in terms of environment, 'yes or no concept' and 'star performer' translation
 In the form of unintelligible words like 'nayakatak'

 That is, a strong arrangement has been made to not allow Indian languages and rural students to become IAS

 The committee constituted in December 2011 under the chairmanship of Nigwekar has also raised questions
 agast 2012 main pesh report main cameti ne kaha tha, ''siset parchaa shahari prishthbhumi ke english medium abhyarthiyon ko phayda pahunchaa rahaa he or isse gramin prishthbhumi ke chaatro ko nuksaan ho rahaa he
 ”the committee also said that this leaflet would benefit the students with IIT and IIM
 haalanki isi cameti ne ve vivaadit siforishein bhi kii thim, jin par pichley saal march main bavaal hua tha
 These recommendations, ignoring the mandatory question papers of English and Indian languages, were then followed by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J
 jayalalita or madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne virodh kiya tha
 The matter was later relaxed by removing the English imperative, but the cassette remained
 is maamle main upiessi puri tarah maun he
 Now let's look at the root of the problem from the data point of view - English medium students in the prelims exam in 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively 51
 6 fisadi, 54
 5 percent and 62
 2 fisadi safal hue, jabaki isi dauraan hindi ke chaatro kaa safalataa aankade 45, 42 or 35 fisadi rahe
 Now see what happened after the introduction of CISET in 2011? In 2011, 83 percent of English students and 82 percent of students managed prelims in 2012, while only 15 and 16 percent of students from Hindi were able to qualify the prelims exam respectively
 anya bhashaaen dekhen to 2008 ke prilims main kannada, telugu or tamil madhyam ke kramash: 14, 117 or 98 chaatr kaamyaab hue the jo 2011 main ghatakar 5, 29 or 14 chaatro par simat kar rah gaya
 When the prelims was sorted, the end result was bound to be disappointing
 nateeja yah he ki 2009 main jahaan hindi madhyam se 222 civil sarvice afasar bane the, vahiin 2013 main ab tak praapt aankadon ke mutabik sirf 26 hindi madhyam vaale lok seva pariksha main kaamyaab hue
 Reacting to these figures, former IRS officer and now Supreme Court advocate Virag Gupta said, "I passed UPSC exam with Hindi main subject
 lekin ye aankade to bataate hai ki mere jaise log to ab is pariksha main paas hi nahin ho paaenge
 Expressing his full support for the students' struggle, Gupta said that when Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself is the biggest advocate of Hindi and Indian languages, it is a matter of concern for students to reach such a position
 lekin hakeekat yah bhi he ki is aam chunaav main puri hindi pattee jin narendra modi ke karishme par fida ho gai, unheen modi kii choukhat se hindi kii ladaai badi beabaru hokar lauti
 "on 27 June, thousands of students traveled from Mukherjee Nagar to the Prime Minister's residence via Rajghat," says Chittaranjan Kumar, who is involved in the movement
 lekin police ne chaatro ko rajghat par hi roak liya
 Despite this, the students did not listen and some 100 students hid in the afternoon near the Prime Minister's residence, 7 Race Course Road

 The BJP, which had won the last assembly elections with an overwhelming majority, won all the 25 seats in Rajasthan in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin 2018 main hue loksabhaa upachunaav main alvar or ajmer seat congress ne hathiyaa lee
 Jalore seat of Rajasthan has been the Congress's stronghold since the beginning, but since this seat became common in the 2009 delimitation, Deviji Patel of BJP is MP from here for 2 consecutive times
 raajnneetik prishthbhumijalaur loksabhaa kshetra aazaadee ke baad se hi anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit seat thi
 In the total 16 Lok Sabha elections held here, Congress won 8 times, 4 times BJP, 1 time Swatantra Party, 1 time Bharatiya Lok Dal and 1 independent candidate

 1967 main swatantra party, 1977 main bldi jiti
 So in the 1989, 2004, 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP set its flag
 is lihaaj se pichley 3 baar se jalaur seat par lagaataar bijepi kaa kabja he
 Deviji Patel of BJP is a two-time MP from here
 anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit hone ke kaaran yah seat congress kaa garh rahaa
 Former Union Minister and former Governor Buta Singh Jalore represented the Lok Sabha 4 times
 bootaa singh ke varchasv ko todane ke liye bijepi main unke kad kaa koi bada dalit netaa nahin tha
 Therefore, in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP pitted former national president Bangaru Laxman from South India as a Dalit face against Buta Singh
 lekin bangaroo lakshmana yah chunaav haar gaye
 After this, Sushila Bangaru, wife of Bangaru Laxman, was made BJP candidate in Jalore in 2004 Lok Sabha elections

 upie sarkaar ke dauraan paryaavaran mantri rahi jayanti natarajan ne congress se istipha de diya he
 He also made a big disclosure, in which he made serious allegations against Rahul Gandhi
 angreji akhbaar 'da hindu' ke mutabik, natarajan ne sonia gandhi ko ek khat likhaa, jisamen unhone kaha he ki paryaavaran se jude kai projects ko hari jhandi na dene ke liye un par rahul gandhi kii ore se dabaav tha
 He wrote that after his resignation, Rahul Gandhi's office campaigned against him in the media
 isamen ye bhi sanket die gaye hai ki rahul gandhi upie sarkaar ke dauraan ahm faislon main shaamil the, jabaki congress isse hameshaa inkaar karti rahi
 In this letter, Jayanthi Natarajan has also indicated that she was removed 100 days before the election, while the Congress claimed that she was being sent to the organization to work for the party
 upie sarkaar main 2011 se 2013 tak van evam paryaavaran rajyamantri (swatantra prabhaar) rahane vaali jayanti natarajan ne congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 In fact, Jayanthi Natarajan was accused that many projects of development could not be started due to his laxity
 loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi aarope lagaaya tha ki filein jayanti tex kii vajah se rukati hai, lekin usee narendra modi ko lekar janyati natarajan ne chitthee main likhaa he ki snupaget main narendra modi ko fansaane kii sajeesh congress kii thi
 By the way, the question may be about the timing, while there are elections in Delhi and Rahul Gandhi is busy campaigning, why was this letter written in November leaked at this time? gauratlab he ki jayanti natarajan par 35 aise mahatvapurn projects ko hari jhandi nahin dene kaa aarope he, jo hajaar se paanch hajaar karod tak ke hai
 It is noteworthy that Jayanti brought Natarajan to the Rajiv Gandhi Congress, but in the time of Narasimha Rao left the Jayanthi Party and joined the Tamil Manila Congress led by GK Moopanar, then Sonia Gandhi brought her back to the party

 The meaning of the word 'hindu' is not limited to just one religion
 french or farsi samet bahut-si bhashaaon main ‘indian’ yaa bhartiya ke liye ‘hindu’ shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Originally the meaning of 'hindu' was limited to the people across the Indus or 'indus' river
 ab yah nadi islamic pakistan main padati he, jisase sthiti or ulajh jaati he
 The word 'hindu' did not exist in any Indian language, until the use of the word by foreigners gave Indians a term for self-definition
 duusare shabdon main kahen to hindu jis shabd se khud ko paribhaashit karte hai vah unka khud kaa gadha hua shabd nahin he, balki dusron se apanaaya gaya shabd he

 It covers many theories and religious practices, which range from 'pantheism' to 'atheism' and from faith in 'avatars' to belief in 'casteism', but in any of these a Hindu There is no mandatory script
 hamaare dharm main koi bhi hathdharmita nahin he
 This is of course a unique thing
 ek catholic isliye catholic hota he kyonki vah isa ko ishwar-putr maanata he, jisane manushyata ke liye apane jivan kaa balidaan diya
 He believes in 'spotless conception' and 'virgin Mary'; Gives confession in church; And moves according to the guidance of the Pope and the clergy
 ek muslim yah vishwaas karata he ki allaah ke alaava or koi ishwar nahin he or ‘mohammad’ uskaa pigambar he
 a Jew observes his Torah, then a Parsi worships at the Fire Temple
 ek sikh gurugranthsahib ko sabase upar or shraddhey maanata he
 There is no equivalent of any of these in Hinduism
 ek hindu hone ke liye koi bhi anivaary shart nahin he
 Moreover, there is no belief in God

 This was an example of how the Hindu 'idea' about religion was that it was a completely private matter
 yah puja-archana sirf aapke or aapke manachaahe ishwariya pratik ke bich thi

 In a special conversation Manisha told- 'I think we have to change this
 40 plus actresses ko filmon main lead role milane chahie jo kuch had tak 'dear maaya' main he
 But it is great that stars like Shah Rukh and Salman are ruling the industry so far
 2-3 dashakon kii kamyaabi myne rakhti he

 These brokers were taking advantage of which you were rightfully entitled to
 hamane aapke liye kaam kiya he
 It was such people who were never born, but other middlemen were filling their chests in his name
 iske saath hi piem modi ne kaha, 'centre sarkaar 24, 25 or 30 rupye main ek kilo genhu kharid kar use sirf do rupye main rashan kii dukaan main uplabdh karaati he
 That is, a wheat of 25 to 27 rupees gives two rupees to the poor
 taaki garib kha sake
 The central government also purchases rice for 30 to 32 rupees and delivers it to the poor for just three rupees
 lekin ye genhu va chaaval us garib tak pahunchane nahin diya jaataa he
 An entire system was made that used to get most of the grain with the help of fake ration cards
 jab garib sasta rashan lene dukaan par jaataa tha to use bataate the ki maal nahin he saamaan bik gaya
 'significantly, this is not the first time that PM Modi has praised the central government and attacked the earlier government

 i wanted to give everyone a common officer
 unhone kaha tha kimain sirf garibi ke aadhaar par samaan adhikaar dena chahta hum
 It is not wrong to talk about equality of opportunity and social justice to all
 pehle se jinakon aarakshan kii suvidha mil rahi thi use chede bina samaanya varg ko aarakshan diya gaya
 Not only this, education will also be increased by ten percent
 yani siton ko badhaayaa jayega
 i will not make any claim that everything will be okay with this
 lekin yah rasta he jo samaanya varg ke garibon ko avasar kii samanta detaa he
 Our workers should discuss this
 main phir bataa duun ki hamanen kisi varg ko vanchit kiye bina yah vyavastha kii gai he
 Some people want to spread dissatisfaction by spreading confusion

 Prashant Bhushan is questioning the Forensic Lab of Delhi and CERT Lab of Delhi Police, taking recourse to this report

 Apart from this, there can be many other reasons for this

 Seating also affects many parts of our body
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab ye he ki baithne ke tareeke ko sudharkar ham rojaanaa hone vaale body pen se raahat paa sakate hai
 The most important thing in this is the way to sit on the chair

 In this case, there is a lot of pressure on the spine
 sidney skool of public health study ke ke anusaar, asia or africa main ye samasya sabase zyada he
 If your sitting is not right then your back and neck can be painful
 aise main ye jaruri ho jaataa he ki ham jo bhi karen use karne ke dauraan hamaara poshchar sahi rahe
 You may be surprised to know that sitting in the right posture also reduces stress
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki aakhir sahi poshchar kya hona chahie?aap jab bhi kursi par baithe hon, koshish kiijie ki aapaki peeth bilkul sidhi ho
 Your hips should be fully touching the back of the chair
 aap chahen to santulan banane ke liye peeche kii ore ek tauliya rakh sakate hai
 While sitting, your knees should be at some height than your hips
 iske saath hi aapaki kursi or mej ke bich bhi samaan duuri honi chahie
 The height of your table and chair also matters a lot
 in sari baton ke saath hi is baat kaa bhi vishesh khyaal rakhana chahie ki samay-samay par aap apni kursi se uthte rahen
 Sitting in the same posture for a long time can be dangerous

 It is being told that the channel was going to hold a press conference in the prime time segment on Monday at 9
30 pm to expose the Congress government, but it was boycotted by many cable operators just before that

 The BJP has been considered a party for urban areas
 sarkaar shahari votaron or muddon par focus bhi karti he, lekin yah kavayad chunavi safalataa ke lakshya ko puraa nahin kar paati
 Due to the frustration spread between rural India and farmers, pressure is mounting on the Modi government to focus on 68 percent of the country's population

 yahaan silicon vaili ke ham thode-se log ek arase se ek paheli ko sulajhane main uljhe hai: jabardast pratibha ke dhani logon kaa desh hindustan garib kyon he? na keval hindustani vaigyanik, ejeeniyar or udhyami, balki hindustan ke netaa or naukarshah bhi duniya ke sabase medhaavi logon main se hai
 Then why is it that when it comes to formulating and implementing economic policies, India has been scoring goals against itself? Hindustan has achieved some spectacular achievements that have transformed the country and set an example for the world
 masalan harith kranti, jisaki badaulat hindustan apni ek arab se zyada aabaadi kaa pet bharne kii jarurat se kahin zyada ugaata he
 His achievements in the field of space and atomic energy programs have earned the respect of the world at bay
 abhinav aadhaar project or uniphid pement interphes (upiai) hindustani sooyeeboojh ke pramaan hai
 Then why do we prove to be inferior in every other case? Can we learn from these magnificent achievements and replicate the factors leading to such success? In all the achievements, one important thing is that they were led by eminent experts of the field and all were on the same table The bureaucrats who were weighed were kept so far away from them that no one could put a hitch
 hindustan ke netaa nitiyaan banane ke liye inhen par nirbhar rahe hai, jabaki isi kaam ke liye ye feet nahin hai
 Whenever this leader indulged himself in the formulation of economic policies — such as the 1991 economic liberalization, which made bureaucracy redundant for a large part of the economy — the results have been spectacular
 telecom ko niyam-kaayadon kii jakadaaa se aaazaad karne, vittiya kshetra ko udaar banane, naagarik uddyan ko niyamon kii jakadbandi se nikaalane, auto sector main nitigat badlaavon or aise hi kai duusare kshetron ke bare main bhi yahi sach he
 Most of the policies of India in various fields like general administration, health, defense, electronics, education are still governed by the bureaucracy, which is considered as 'sab Paddy Bias Paseeri'
 yah nitiyon kaa puraa khaakaa taiyaar karti or amal karwaati he
 Ministers like Union Minister for Highways, Shipping and Water Resources Nitin Gadkari are deeply involved in this process
 or hindustan kii aazaadee ke baad se hi har sarkaar kaa yahi dharra rahaa he
 The result: havoc
 angreji raaj se viraasat main hasil rajkaaj ke is afasarshahi model ko fauladi hona hi tha
 Its design is such that this type of bureaucracy is ready to take precaution and follow in the footsteps of the old Nazis, which encourages not to work quickly and fast, and in the democracy, the response that people expect from zeal and diligence
 Are, in that and so far below, high standards in finding new solutions
 sarkaar kii nitiyaan banane or unhen lagu karne ke harek pahalu ko aisi afasarshahi ke kadamon main daal dena sankeern tarika apnaanaa he or hindustan kii tarakkee kaa galaa ghont dena he
 They have no understanding of the future results of any policy
 isse bhi badtar baat yah ki protsaahan yaa badhaava dene ke dhaanche bemail hai, isliye afasarshah nitiyon ke kharaab amal kii keemat khud kabhi nahin chukaate, balki desh or sattadhari netaa chukaate hai
 This trend is reflected in repeated 'anti-incumbency' elections which overturn state and central governments and this happens more than any other big country here
 masalan 2017 main maal or seva kar (jiesti) kii ulajhaau or pechida shuruyaat ko lijie
 The BJP government had to deal with the travails and nervousness of businessmen and small traders
 isaki sajaa kisi bhi afasarshah ko nahin mili
 Prosperity and wealth follow innovation or innovation
 aaj ke chaar sabase nawachaari or isliye phydemand udyogon ko lijieh semiconductor, vaimaaniki, chikitsa upkaran or davaaiyaan
 How much has Hindustan contributed to them? Zero
 duniya bhar ke semiconductor udyog main ahm ohadon par khaasaa acha pratishat hindustaniyon kaa he, phir bhi hindustan kaa yogadan sifer
 Every technology minister has made a pilgrimage to Silicon Valley, said good things and yet nothing happened in the last 30 years
 is bich hindustan kaa electronics aayaat kaa bill uske tel aayaat se kahin zyada bada hone vaala he
 Why is it that India has consistently failed to formulate an effective semiconductor policy? This is because the policy makers are all bureaucrats with paddy twenty-two crops who have a shallow and superficial knowledge of the region
 kushagra se kushagra afasarshah ko bhi ek jatil vaishvik udyog kii rakrataar kaa vigyaan seekhney main vakt lagata he or jab tak ve thodaa-bahut samaj pate hai, agali tainaati kaa vakt aa jaataa he
 In the next ministry, he takes the highest decisive role on the very first day and this cycle of poor information-making decisions, narrow design of execution and poor execution is repeated
 inamen se kisi bhi baat kaa matlab yah kahana nahin he ki afasarshah pratibhashali, mehnatee or eemaandaar nahin hai
 Some are truly extraordinary and feel the need and speed to work, but such exceptions are just exceptions
 kuch afasarshah thik hai, yah kehane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki afasarshahi ek vyavastha ke taur par thik he or bhartiya arthvyavastha ko achche-se haank sakati he
 Just because Ashoka and Akbar were great emperors does not mean that the monarchy was the ideal system
 ham samajhate hai ki yaheen shaayad ek samaadhaan chipa he
 Every government that comes to power should have such leeway that it can appoint around 30 people from the private sector and from civil society, get them scrutinized and approved by the Parliament and they get part of the bureaucracy during that government's tenure
 Assign decision-making roles
 in 'rajnatik afasarshahon' ke paas na keval apni bhoomikaaon ke liye jaruri visheshgyata honi chahie balki unamem teji se fouran kaam karne kii jarurat kaa ehsaas or vot dekar satta main laai gai sarkaar ke agenda kaa samarthan bhi hona chahie
 The question that will immediately arise will be about the potential conflict of interest in the appointment of a person to deal with policy-making and implementation in his area of expertise
 hindustan sareekhe vishaal desh main aise pratibhashali logon ko khojna hameshaa mumkin he jo itane udaatt vichaaron vaale hon ki desh ke hit ko apane hit se upar rakh saken
 There is no dearth of highly talented and honest talented people in India
 doordarshee or aadhaar ke shilpkaar nandan nilekani ne kaam kii khayraaten baantate hue infosis par koi meharbaani nahin kii
 There are many professionals like Nilekani, who if given a chance, are full of inspiration to do great work for the country
 yah gaddinshin party kii jimmedaari he ki vah aise logon kii pahchaan kare or unki jaanch-padtaal karnaa sansad kii jimmedaari he
 And we should know by now that we can reject the myth of 'prejudice-free' bureaucracy
 kisi bhi rajya kii rajdhani ke bashindon se kisi bhi afasarshah ke rajnatik jhukaavon ke bare main puuchhie, ve anginat kisse suna sakate hai
 If the people have elected a particular government and entrusted it with power, then they have the right to a structure of rule that is responsive to their needs and aspirations
 is maamle main pahal karne or badhat lene vaali kisi bhi rajnatik party ko fouran sattalolup or saansthanik akhandta kii jaden khodne vaali party qaraar de diya jayega
 We should not be misled by such accusations — the selfishness of any power that is deeply rooted in this is that it can make any change unethical
 yathasthiti ke saath ek vaidhanik chetavanee honi chahie ki yah rajnatik swasthya ke liye hanikaarak he
 Leaders of the entire political spectrum must support this change
 hotmel ke sansthaapak sabir bhaatia philhal smart building divaais company biscuit labs ke sioo hai; kanwal rekhi tiii global ke purv chair or philhal invents capital parteners main bhagidaar hai, venkatesh shukla tiii global ke purv chair or monta vista capital ke sansthaapak bhagidaar hainijee kshetra or naagarik samaaj ke logon ko afasarshahi main faisle lene vaali bhoomikaaon main niyukt kiya janaa chahie*** The meeting between Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has been postponed, a strategic account has been drawn for the Uttar Pradesh elections
 lekin congress ne akhilesh ko do took kah diya he ki pehle aap samaajawaadee party ke bheetar faisla kiijie phir ham aapke saath hai, sutron kii maane to akhilesh yadav ne rahul gandhi ko sandesh diya he ki samaajawaadee party ke bheetar kaa faisla chunaav ayog 13 taarikh ko karegaa, isliye us faisle ke baad hi ham milakar faisla karen, aage bade behatar rahegaa
 That is why the meeting between Rahul and Akhilesh on January 10 has now progressed
 gauratlab he ki 13 taarikh ko chunaav ayog faisla karegaa cycle kiski hogi yaa kiski nahin yaa kuekhilesh kii motorcyclhogi ! uske baad hi congress ke saath talmail kii baat aage badhegi
 In that case, Akhilesh will find out whether he is the survey survey of the SP and decide everything there
 aise main yah baat to tay he ki congress ke ranneetikaar or akhilesh ke sipahasaalar yah maan rahe hai ki gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa kii taarikh ko abhi aage badha diya gaya he
 But the important question is whether Akhilesh will go ahead and decide or will he agree to Mulayam's fall from the powers of Shivpal and Amar Singh not to align with Congress
 mulaayam kehete hai ki muslimon ko congress ke paale main mat jane do ek baar chale gaye to hamaari party ko lambey vakt nuksaan hoga
 At the same time, Akhilesh says that when i will become the Chief Minister, i will have a long-term relationship with Rahul, then political loss will not benefit
 aise main sab kuch akhilesh ke hisaab se chalaa to group main congress, akhilesh, areldi or tamaam jo chote dalon ke bich mahagathbandhan hoga
 But if Mulayam managed to convince his son that he should not keep pace with the Congress, then the new story will write the story of politics
 haalanki akhilesh ke bare main kehete hai ki unako kya karnaa he, wo kyon mulaayam ke saath jaaenge ham to rahul kaa haath thamenge

 Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray lashed out at the Election Commission (EC) on Thursday
 unhone chunaav ayog ko ek 'bhrasht sanstha' bataate hue desh main chunaav karaane main 'avyavashtha' ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya
 He said that Shiv Sena will fight all future elections alone without any alliance
 uddhav thakare ne media se baatcheet main aarope lagaaya ki electronic voting mashiinon (iviem) main isi adhikariyon kii jaankaree main bade str par gadabadi kii ja rahi he
 Uddhav Thackeray said, “the election and counting of votes in Palghar was a complete joke
 chunaavon ke baad, raturaat lagbhag 100,000 mat kaise bad gaye? hamen iskaa saboot chahie
 There is deception in it
 "unhone kaha ki shivasena ne apane ummidavaar shrinivas vanga ke kareeb 29,000 voton ke antar se haarane ke baad phir se matganana kii maang kii he
 Uddhav Thackeray said, "the Shiv Sena's votes suddenly dropped by several thousand in the latter phase
 yah kaise sambhav he? hamane phir se matganana kii maang kii he, lekin hamen nahin ummid he ki chunaav ayog is par dhyaan degaa
 "he said that Shiv Sena's defeat in Palghar was a statement of 'sama, daam, dand and bhed' given by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on the eve of election, which is not acceptable to us
 shivaneta ne kaha, "hamane pehali baar palghar main chunaav ladaa, hamaare paas khaas taur se doordaraj ke janajaatiy kshetron main ek uchit party kaa dhaancha nahin tha
 Nevertheless, we gave a tough fight to the BJP
 "chunaav ayogper nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki ab sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko chunaav ayog va uske kaamkaaj ke khilaaf adaalat main chalanaa chahie
 Its work has raised doubts in the minds of the people
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kya mukhya nirvachan ayukta kaa desh main chunaav tantra par niyantran he yaa nahin or unhone zikr kiya ki kaise iviem achaanak se chunaav prakriya ke dauraan bich main kharaab ho gayi, matganana va duusare maamalon main visangatiyaan kyon hai
 He said, "I believe this is also the time to 'elect' not just appoint officers of the Election Commission, as he has now become the puppet of the ruling party
" " unhone sawaal uthaaya ki kya is baat kii kahin jarurat to nahin aa padi he ki desh main chunaav prakriya kii nigaraanee ke liye antarrashtriya paryvekshakon ko niyukt kiya jaae?endie se naata todane par chuppiuddhav thakare ne doharaaya ki shivasena bhavishya main sabhi chunaav bina kisi raajnneetik dal ke saath gathjod ke swatantra rup se ladegi
 He said, "BJP no longer needs friends
 
 We will contest alone in future
 " raajnneetik atakalon ke vipareet shivasena pramukh nerashtriya janatantric gathbandhanaya maharashtra sarkaar se baahar jane kii sambhaavna par koi tippanee nahin kii
 Leave the NDA, Uddhav Uddhav Thackeray's allegations have been justified by former Union Minister and NCP leader Praful Patel
 unhone kaha, thakare thik bol rahe hai, lekin log unki baton par tab tak bharosa nahin karenge jab tak vah bijepi kaa samarthan karte rahenge
 If he leaves the NDA, then everyone will start trusting his words

 In order to disperse the protesters, the police had to release tear gas shells and water cannons

 While Kiran was opposed to the protest against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Kejriwal could not stop attacking the BJP along with the Congress
 kejariwal ne yahaan tak tak kah diya ki desh main vipaksh he hi nahin
 Both Congress and BJP are involved in corruption while Bedi's attitude towards BJP was slightly soft
 haalanki bedi ne baad main is aarope ko khaarij bhi kiya
 He also said that IAC cannot be an option for a country suddenly
 chhitput tareeke se shuru hue kejariwal va unke sahyogiyon ke is virodh pradarshan ne dopaher baad chamatkaarik dhang se vikaraal rup dhaaran kar liya
 The police were stunned to see such a large number of India Against Corruption (IAC) activists

 While the area around Gadkari's residence was relatively peaceful, there was a vigorous vigil near Sonia's residence at 10 Janpath and the Prime Minister's seven Race Course Road
 jab ghanton chale naatak ke baad narebaaji karte hue pradarshnakariyon ne police bairicade tod die to police ne unhen teetar-bitar karne ke liye pani kii bauchhaarein chodi or aansu gas ke gole daage
 Kejriwal and advocate and IAC leader Prashant Bhushan accused the police of using force without any provocation
 bhushan ne ek bas ke andar se kaha, "yah sab karne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 They unnecessarily used water splashes and tear gas
 " Kejriwal called the protest a success and said that the IAC has been able to take the issue to door to door that both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are responsible for the coal block allocation scam
 kejariwal ne utsaahi bheed ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, "hamane sarkaar ke asli chehre ko benakaab kiya he
 We have told that Congress and BJP have looted this country
 " About 2 more than seven hours after the protests began
 30 baje kejariwal ne virodh pradarshan samaapt karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Police justified the use of force, saying the IAC protests in VIP areas were unauthorized
 iske pehle, ravivaar tadake police ne kejariwal or chah anya kaaryakartaaon ko hiraasat main le liya tha, lekin thane ke baahar jab saikadon samarthakon ne jutakar narebaaji shuru kii to lagbhag do ghante baad unhen reeha kar diya gaya
 Kejriwal was stopped along with two other accomplices near a police barricade near Manmohan Singh's residence
 iasi ke anya netaa, manish sisodiya ko sahyogiyon ke saath 10 janpath ke baahar hiraasat main le liya gaya tha
 An IAC spokesperson said, "some of the detained activists were scrambled
 " When the entire group was released, Kejriwal and other activists reached Jantar Mantar and resolved to return to Manmohan Singh's residence, which he completed
 kejariwal ne sawaal kiya ki sarkaar aakhir unhen kyon roak rahi he
 Kejriwal said, "why are we being prevented from peaceful protests? Congress and BJP protest so much
 unhen kabhi nahin roka jaataa
 When Raj Thackeray organizes the rally without police permission, thousands of people take part in it, then they are not stopped, but they are given police protection
 yadi ham shantipurna pradarshan karte hai to phir hamen kyon hiraasat main liya jaataa he?" By noon, hundreds of workers marched to the residence of the Prime Minister and the Congress President with the National Flag in their hands
 ise dekhakar mutthibhar pulicekarmi dang rah gaye
 Where Kejriwal was near Manmohan Singh's residence, Bhushan was near Sonia's residence
 ek samay police ne kaaryakartaaon ko peeche dhakelne kii koshish kii, jiske baad donon pakshon main takaraav kii naubat aa gai
 The crowd was trying to move forward, shouting slogans like 'halla Bol' and 'we Want Justice'
 tippaniyan Kejriwal pledged to continue the protests for a long time
 unhone kaha, "yadi ve yah sochate hai ki ve bhrashtachar karte rahenge to ham bhi virodh pradarshan jari rakhenge
 We will definitely protest
 yah hamaari kranti he
 " ek chakit karne vaale kadam ke tahat dilli metro ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve sabhi chah stesan khule rahenge, jinhen virodh pradarshan ko naakaam karne ke kram main ravivaar ko subah aath baje se shaam chah baje tak band rakhane kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi
 Kejriwal and his supporters went out to besiege the house of PM, Sonia and Gadkari over coal allocation
 is pradarshan main kejariwal samarthakon kii police se jhadap bhi hui or lathicharge bhi hua
 Kejriwal and his associates were also detained
 ab police tod-phod kaa video footage dekh rahi he jiske baad unki giraftaar ho sakati he
 Team Anna has never been booked before
 dhyaan rahe, gandhivadi saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare kii anupasthiti main arvind kejariwal ne ravivaar ko dilli sahit deshbhar ke kai rajyon main shakti pradarshan kiya
 Under his leadership, anti-corruption activists protested strongly near the residence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 pradarshnakariyon ko teetar-bitar karne ke liye police ko aansu gas ke gole chhodane pade or pani kii bauchhaarein kerani padi
 During this whole incident, differences between Kejriwal and Kiran Bedi also came to the fore
 kiran jahaan bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke khilaaf pradarshan ke virodh main thim vahiin kejariwal congress ke saath bhaajapa par bhi hamalaa karne se nahin chuke
 Kejriwal even said that there is no opposition in the country
 congress or bhaajapa donon bhrashtachar main lipt hai jabaki bedi kaa bhaajapa ke prati rukh thodaa naram rahaa
 However, Bedi later denied the charge
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki iasi ekaek desh ke liye vikalp nahin ho saktaa
 This protest by Kejriwal and his colleagues started sporadically in the afternoon and took a miraculous form in the afternoon
 india against karpshan (iasi) ke kaaryakartaaon kii itani badi sankhya dekh police dang rah gai
 These activists came out to execute their declaration of siege of Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and BJP President Nitin Gadkari
 gadakari ke awaas ke aasapaas kaa kshetra jahaan apekshaakrit shantipurna tha, vahiin sonia ke 10 janpath or pradhanmantri ke saat rescorse maarg sthit awaas ke paas joardaar shakti pradarshan hua
 When protesters broke the police barricades while chanting slogans after hours of drama, police fired water cannons and fired tear gas shells to disperse them
 kejariwal or adhivaktaa va iasi netaa prashanth bhushan ne police par aarope lagaaya ki usne bagaiyr kisi uksaave ke bal prayog kiya
 Bhushan said from inside a bus, “there was no need to do all this
 unhone anaavashyak rup se pani kii bauchhaaron or aansu gas kaa prayog kiya
 " kejariwal ne virodh pradarshan ko safal bataaya or kaha ki iasi is mudde ko ghar-ghar tak pahunchane main safal rahi he ki koyala block aavanton ghotaale ke liye congress or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa), donon jimmedaar hai
 Kejriwal addressing the enthusiastic crowd said, "we have exposed the real face of the government
 hamane bataaya he ki congress or bhaajapa ne is desh ko lutaa he
 " virodh pradarshan shuru hone ke saat ghante se adhik samay baad lagbhag 2
 At 30, Kejriwal announced the end of the protest
 police ne yah kehete hue bal prayog ko jaij tehraaya ki viipi ilaakon main iasi kaa virodh pradarshan anadhikrut tha
 Earlier, Kejriwal and six other activists were detained by the police in the early hours of Sunday, but were released after nearly two hours when hundreds of supporters gathered outside the police station to raise slogans
 kejariwal ko manmohan singh ke awaas ke kareeb ek police bairicade ke paas do anya sahyogiyon ke saath roak diya gaya tha
 Another IAC leader, Manish Sisodia, was taken into custody along with colleagues outside 10 Janpath

 " puure samooh ko jab reeha kar diya gaya to kejariwal or anya kaaryakarta jantar mantar pahunche or manmohan singh ke awaas par dobaaraa lautne kaa sankalp liya, jise unhone puraa kiya
 Kejriwal questioned why the government is stopping him
 kejariwal ne kaha, "hamen shantipurna pradarshan se aakhir kyon roka ja rahaa he? congress or bhaajapa itane virodh pradarshan karti he
 They are never stopped
 jab raaj thakare bagaiyr police anumati ke raily yojit karte hai, hajaaron log usamen hissaa lete hai, tab unhen nahin roka jaataa, alabatta unhen police suraksha di jaati he
 If we hold a peaceful demonstration then why are we detained? " dopaher tak saikadon kaaryakarta haathon main rashtradhvaj liye pradhanmantri or congress adhyaksh ke awaas kii ore bade
 a handful of policemen were stunned by this
 kejariwal jahaan manmohan singh ke awaas ke paas the, to bhushan sonia ke awaas ke paas
 At one time, the police tried to push the activists back, after which the two sides got into a confrontation
 bheed 'hallaa bol' or 've waant justise' kaa naaraa lagaate hue aage badhane kii koshish kar rahi thi
 The comments kejariwal ne virodh pradarshan ko lambe samay tak jari rakhane kaa sankalp liya
 He said, "if they think that they will continue to do corruption then we will continue to protest
 ham nischitator par virodh pradarshan karenge
 This is our revolution

 kiran jahaan bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke khilaaf pradarshan ke virodh main thim vahiin kejariwal congress ke saath bhaajapa par bhi hamalaa karne se nahin chuke
 Kejriwal even said that there is no opposition in the country

 However, Bedi later denied the charge
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki iasi ekaek desh ke liye vikalp nahin ho saktaa

 Both Congress and BJP are involved in corruption while Bedi's attitude towards BJP was slightly soft
 haalanki bedi ne baad main is aarope ko khaarij bhi kiya

 Kejriwal and advocate and IAC leader Prashant Bhushan accused the police of using force without any provocation
 bhushan ne ek bas ke andar se kaha, "yah sab karne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin thi

 unhone kaha ki gujarat main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ummidavaaron ke paksh main prachaar ke liye bihar ke saiyad shahanvaj hossain, ravishankar prasad or rajeev pratap rudi jaise netaaon ko mahatv nahin diya janaa or unhen aamantrit nahin kiye jane main unhen modiji ke khilaaf sajeesh najar aati he
 Giriraj said that the media reports about the Gujarat Chief Minister degrading the BJP leaders of Bihar were aimed at creating confusion within the party and discrediting Modi ji in the eyes of the people here
 giriraaj ne kaha ki bhaajapa ko saavdhaneepurvak keval 40 party prachaarkon main rashtriya evam rajya stareey netaaon ko chunanaa he or gujarat chunaav ke liye party netritv ne chunaav ayog ko bhaajapa ke prachaarkon kii suchi saunpi he unamem paanch se saat rashtriya netaa jabaki baaki rajyastareey netaa shaamil hai
 He said that the information he has received has not closed the doors for the party leaders from Bihar to go to Gujarat for campaigning and along with him two hundred leaders and workers of the party will go there from here onwards
 bhaajapa ne chunaav ayog ke samaksh gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan party ummidavaaron ke liye 40 prachaarkon kii jo suchi saunpi he usamen ravishankar prasad, rajeev pratap rudi or musalmaan chehre saiyad shahanvaj hossain evam mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ke naam shaamil nahin hai
 With this list of the BJP, there are speculations within the party and in the political corridor that Modi has deliberately sidelined his colleagues from Bihar for being sympathetic to his Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 aisa bhi kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa he ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne pradesh ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or sahyogi dal jadyu ke kehane par party netaaon dwaara unhen gat varsh hue bihar vidhansabha chunaav or usase purv 2009 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main yahaan chunaav prachaar ke liye unhen nahin bulaaye jane kaa badale main kiya he
 There was a time when Bollywood emperor Shahrukh Khan gave a press conference and informed that how he was searched in an objectionable way at the airport while traveling to America
 lekin vakt badi teji se gujara he
 The same US President Barack Obamane, who recently came to India, not only garnered praise for Narendra Modi, who had been deprived of his visa for many years, but also tried to win the heart by speaking the dialogue of Shah Rukh Khan's famous film
 obama ne yah bhi kaha, 'hamen shahrukh khan, milkha singh, mairi com or kailash satyaarthee par garv he
 Obama speaking Shahrukh's dialogue, watch the video: dilli chunaav ayog ne 2 din pehle dilli main sabhi hording, binar, nem plate aadi se 'aam' shabd dhakne / hatwane ke aadesh die the, lekin adhikariyon ne karrwai na sirf 'aam' balki 'aadmi' or siem arvind kejariwal ke photo tak dhak daale
 If we see in the pictures of the common man Mohalla Clinic of Kashmiri Gate, Delhi, then you will know how the authorities passed the orders of the Election Commission by his order

 Significantly, the Delhi Election Commission had ordered the Chief Secretary of Delhi to remove or cover the word 'aam' written on all hoardings, displays, banners etc
 in Delhi
 dilli sarkaar ke adhikaar kshetra main aane vaale aise hording / nem plate / binar aadi ko hataakar / dhankkar 48 ghante ke bheetar chunaav ayog ko report karen
 The Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi has run Aam Aadmi Mohalla Clinic, Aam Aadmi Polyclinic for Delhi Health Service, while Aam Aadmi Bypass Express Service, a transport service

 " Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati on Tuesday attacked the BJP government at the Center and PM Modi
 ek din pehle hi pravartan nideshaalay ne union bank of india main do aise khate pakade the, jinamein notebandi ke baad karodon rupee jamaa karaae gaye
 One of these accounts was Mayawati's brother Anand, while one account was found by the BSP
 anand ke acount main 43 karod rupee jabakibaspa ke khatemen 104 karod rupee mili hai
 After the announcement of demonetisation in these two accounts, the amount was deposited in crores
 mayawati ne press conference kar centre kii bijepi sarkaar or piem modi par bole ye 15 bade hamaleh1
 PM does not like that Dalit's daughter should do better
 2
 The pm's decision to introduce demonetisation without preparation caused problems for everyone
 3
 If there is any honesty in them, then after 8 November and before that, disclose the money deposited in the bank
 4
 PM Modi is silent about his party's money
 5
 The BSP influential people are being harassed
 6
 This action is just political
 7
 The central government is trying to tarnish the bsp's image
 8
 From 2003 to 2007, they did this against the disgusting people and my neighbors
 9
 BJP and company will suffer the most
 10
 The BJP itself raised the issue of disproportionate assets in 2007, which flopped
 11
 This action of the company will prove to be icing on the cake for us this time too
 12
 i thank the BJP for this
 13
 If Modiji takes one or two decisions like demonetisation, then we will be more comfortable

 whatsapp gold kaa bhoot ek baar phir se waapas aa gaya he
 You must have seen a lot of viral posts about whatsapp Gold in 2016
 itnaa hi nahin whatsapp Plus bhi kaaphi charchaa main rahaa or ye bhi farji tha
 It was being told that the company is bringing whatsapp gold by upgrading whatsapp, but it was completely wrong and still wrong
 is baar bhi soshal media par watsap gold ko lekar log post kar rahe hai jo puri tarah se farji or bhraamak he
 Some videos will also be found on micro-blogging website Twitter and youtube which mention whatsapp Gold
 agar aapke paas watsap gold install karne ke liye email yaa phir massej koi bhi link aae to use open na karen
 Because it can be malware or virus
 watsap gold naam ke feechar kaa koi bhi link aapke paas aae to use report karen
 Neither whatsappgold nor whatsapp Plus has been brought by whatsapp
 aapako bataa den ki watsap ke do varjan hai- ek normal jo aap yuj karte hai or doosraa bijness watsap
 Both are the same, but the business account gets verification whether it is business or not
 bijness acount ke jariye company apane customers se communication karti he
 Apart from this, there is no whatsapp of any kind
 ek watsap massej bhi viral ho rahaa he jisamen kaha gaya he, ‘whatsapp gold, ek video launch kiya jayega jise Martinelli kaha jayega
 Do not open it
 yah virus he or aapke smartphone main aayega or aap kuch bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 Do not upgrade to whatsapp Gold because it is a virus
 ’ Have you asked any friend or neighbor why he watches Hindu Muslim debates on Hindi news channels every evening

 Ask him if you see a Hindu Muslim debate
 news channel par is tarah ke dibet dikhaane kii sanak savaar ho gai he
 There is no use in asking them, so while walking in the train, walking in the bus, at the tea shop in the market, you must definitely ask if you see Hindu Muslim debates on the news channels
 yah ek project he
 The youngster wants to become a doctor, the Hindu Muslim Project wants to riot him
 is project kaa ek hi makasad he ki aap nafrat kii baton se saamaanya hone lagen
 Sitting at home become of a riotous mindset, and when an 83-year-old Zainul Ansari is killed off a bicycle in Sitamarhi, Bihar, burnt, you don't mind
 kya aap apane bacchon ko hindu muslim dibet dikhaanaa chahenge, ek baar soch lijiega
 Maybe you want to make children doctors

 Now come to today's topic
 hamane pichley kai saalon main kisaanon ke kai andolan dekhe
 29–30 Two issues figure prominently at the center of this movement
 fasalon kaa sahi daam diya jaae or fasal bikne kii vyavastha sahi kii jaae
 The Modi government claims the MSP to be one and a half times the cost as promised, but the facts are different
 indian express main nunatam samarthan mulya ko lekar aap harish damodaran kii report dekhte rahiye
 What the government says will be different from what it says
 hamaare sahyogi anuraag dwari ne hi sarkari mulya or kisaanon ke bich kii khai ko lekar report kii he
 The farmers' long march also reached Mumbai and Delhi also came many times
 sarkaar ne jo kiya wo kiya, kya kisaanon ke saath khadey hone kaa daawa karne vaale vipakshi dalon ne kisaanon ko sarkaar se kuch zyada yaa alag samajha he
 Looking at the manifestos of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, it seems that the Congress is understanding the issue of farmers better and is making a solid claim to resolve it
 bijepi ke ghoshnaa patr main jo daawa he wo phir aasamaani daawa he yaa aisa kya nayaa he jo in rajyon main 15 saal se sarkaar chalaate hue bijepi nahin kar pai
 What she is claiming she could not do for farmers during these 15 years
 hamaare saamne chhattisgarh bhaajapa kaa 2013 or 2018 kaa ghoshnaa patr he
 Now we can see what the BJP had promised to the farmers then, whether the new manifesto has information about their fulfillment, what is the new promise in the new manifesto
 2013 main bijepi ne vaada kiya tha 'dhan kaa nunatam samarthan mulya 2100 kii pahal karenge
 300 per quintal bonus
 kisaanon ke ek ek dana dhan kii kharidi hogi
 There was a promise of giving interest-free loans to farmers for farming
 jaivik krishi ko protsaahan denge
 The goal is to make Chhattisgarh a surplus state in milk production in five years
 ' In Chhattisgarh, between 2013-18, farmers have got a bonus of 2400 per quintal including bonus? At this time, Rs 1750 per quintal is given for paddy in Chhattisgarh
 bonus ke taur par 300 rupee die jate hai
 In this way, farmers get 2050 rupees for a quintal of paddy
 na to yah 2400 he or na hi 2100
 Do farmers get bonuses, how many farmers get bonuses
 5 november 2018 ke bijness standard main aar krishna das kii report he ki chhattisgarh main is saal 300 rupee prati quintal bonus dene kii ghoshnaa hui he
 The promise was to be given in 2013, whether 300 rupees bonus was given earlier or was it announced to give 300 rupees bonus only in election year
 kya kisaanon ko is saal bhi 300 rupaya prati quintal bonus mil rahaa he
 In the 2018 manifesto, BJP has stated that the BJP government has given 76,000 crore to farmers in 15 years by combining paddy and bonus amount
 yani har saal sirf dhan kii kharid par 5066 karod kharch kiya
 The total agriculture budget is only 2017-18 1887 crores
 2003-4 main kheti kaa bajet 183
 98 crores
 yah likhaa he ki rajya main sinchai panpon kii sankhya 72000 se badhkar 5 lakh tak pahunch gai he or kisaanon ko bina byaaz ke rin uplabdh karaayaa gaya he
 BJP has said that 7
 3 lakh kisaanon ne byaaz mukt rin kaa laabh uthaaya he
 For this, the state government has given a grant of 184 crores
 2017 disambar main chhattisgarh ke grahamantri ne vidhansabha main jawaab diya tha ki pichley dhai saal main 1344 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 This time the BJP has promised that 'farmers will be given loan without interest
 kisaanon ke dhan or makke kii nunatam samarthan mulya par kharidi kii uchit vyavastha, kisaanon ko 300 rupee prati quintal dhan par bonus
 All mandis will be linked by e-name
 i naam par 100 fisadi vyapaar sunishchit kiya jayega
 Rural agriculture market will be established in 27 districts
 ' There has been talk of making cold storage in every district
 kitne zile main cold storage bane hai, isaki jaankaree nahin he
 Monthly pension of 1000 rupees will be given to small and marginal farmers and landless agricultural laborers above 60 years of age
 kya yah koi alag baat he, kya pehle nahin di jaati rahi he, jo pehle di jaati thi us samay pension kii raashi kya thi
 The 2013 manifesto also stated that Chhattisgarh will be made surplus state in milk production
 2018 ke ghoshnaa patr main likhaa he ki dugdh kranti abhiyaan chalaaya jayega
 What happened to the 2013 promise? kya chhattisgarh duggh utpaadan main sarplus state ban paaya
 In 2013, the BJP said that Chhattisgarh will be made an agricultural capital, whether such a capital is built, and where it is
 2018 main chotii ke paanch rajyon main chhattisgarh nahin he
 See the Congress promise in Chhattisgarh
 sarkaar banane ke das dinon ke bheetar kisaanon kaa karza maaf kar diya jayega
 It is not clear what will be the conditions for waiving the loan, up to which amount will be waived
 kisaanon ke do saal ke dhan kaa bakaayaa bonus kishton main kiya jayega
 The minimum rate of purchase of paddy is Rs 2500 per quintal, for maize Rs 1700 per quintal, the minimum rate of purchase of soybean is Rs 3500 per quintal, the minimum rate of purchase of sugarcane is Rs 355 per quintal, the minimum rate of purchase of gram is Rs 4700 per quintal
 Is a quintal
 july main centre sarkaar ne jin fasalon ke nunatam samarthan mulya jari kiye hai, usase hamane congress ke ghoshnaa patr main milakar dekha he ki kya congress zyada daam kaa vaada kar rahi he
 The total minimum support price of paddy is Rs 1750 per quintal
 congress ne chhattisgarh main 2500 prati quintal dene kaa vaada kiya he
 The central government has fixed a price of Rs 1700 per quintal for maize
 congress chhattisgarh main 1700 rupee prati quintal dene kaa vaada karti he
 The central government has set a price of Rs 3399 per quintal for soybean
 congress ne soyabean kaa 3500 rupee prati quintal nunatam samarthan mulya dene kaa vaada kiya he
 In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress has said that the loan of 2 lakhs of all farmers will be waived
 mandiyon main samarthan mulya se neeche nahin bikne denge
 Bonus will be given on many crops like wheat, paddy, jowar, maize, soybean mustard, cotton
 congress ne naveen fasal beemaa kii baat kii he
 The farm will be the unit of crop insurance
 kisaan alag rahanaa chaahate hai to alag ho sakate hai
 Farmers without debt will also be involved in crop insurance
 gramsabha kii anushansa par fasal beemaa kaa laabh kisaanon ko milegaa
 The comments congress ne sardaar ballab bhai patel kisaan putr swaavlamban yojana launch kii he
 No one notices that not only cow urine in the Congress manifesto, but a plan has also come in the name of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 iske tahat gaanvon main rahane vaale berojgaar yuvakon ko pashupaalan deyari jaise kaam ke liye saste dar par karz denge
 They will get a loan of up to 1 crore and will give irrigation tax exemption, they will be able to sell their produce anywhere and there will be no mandi tax
 congress kaa ek or vaada he
 a bonus of Rs 5 per liter will be given to milk producers through the Milk Producers Association
 congress ne bhi chhattisgarh main bijepi kii tarah madhyapradesh ke 60 saal se adhik umr ke kisaanon ko 1000 masik pension dene kaa vaada kiya he
 We have not written all the things here, but reading these manifestos, can it be understood that the Congress and BJP are presenting some concrete solutions to the problem of farmers
 inaki samaj main vistaar ho rahaa he
 We saw many farmers' movements in the last several years
 29-30 is andolan ke centre main do mudde pramukh rup se rahe
 The prices of crops should be given rightly and the system of selling the crops should be corrected
 modi sarkaar ne nunatam samarthan mulya ko apane vaade ke hisaab se laagat se dedh guna dene kaa daawa karti he lekin tathy kuch duusare bhi hote hai
 Keep watching Harish Damodaran's report on the minimum support price in Indian Express
 sarkaar jo kahati he, usase alag pataa chalegaa
 Our colleague Anurag Dwari has reported on the government price and the gap between farmers
 kisaanon kaa long march mumbai bhi pahunchaa or dilli bhi kai baar aayaa
 What the government has done, whether the opposition parties who claim to stand with the farmers, have considered the farmers as something more or different from the government
 kya chhattisgarh, madhyapradesh ke ghoshnapatron ko dekhte hue aisa lagata he ki congress kisaanon ke masale ko behatar samaj rahi he or sulajhane kaa koi thos daawa kar rahi he
 What is the claim in the bjp's manifesto, is it again a claim or what is new that the BJP could not do while running the government in these states for 15 years
 kya jo vah daawa kar rahi he in 15 saal ke dauraan main kisaanon ke liye nahin kar sakati thi
 Chhattisgarh BJP has 2013 and 2018 manifesto in front of us
 ab ham dekh sakate hai ki bhaajapa ne kisaanon ke liye kya vaade tab kiye the, kya nae ghoshnaptr main unke puure hone kii jaankaree he, nae ghoshnaptr main nayaa vaada kya he
 In 2013, the BJP promised to introduce a minimum support price of 2100 paddy
 300 rupee prati quintal bonus denge
 Every single grain of farmers would have bought paddy
 kisaanon ko kisaani hetu byaaz mukt rin dene kaa vaada tha
 Will encourage organic agriculture
 paanch saal main chhattisgarh ko dugdh utpaadan main sarplus state banane kaa lakshya he
 ' kya chhattisgarh main 2013-18 ke bich kisaanon ko bonus milakar 2400 prit quintal kaa bhav mila he? is vakt chhattisgarh main dhan ke liye 1750 rupee prati quintal diya jaataa he
 300 is given as a bonus
 is tarah se kisaanon ko ek quintal dhan kaa 2050 rupaya hi hota he
 It is neither 2400 nor 2100
 kya kisaanon ko bonus miltaa he, kitne kisaanon ko bonus mila he
 In the Business Standard dated 5 November 2018, r Krishna Das reports that a bonus of Rs 300 per quintal has been announced in Chhattisgarh this year
 vaada to 2013 main dene kaa tha, kya pehle bhi 300 rupaya bonus diya gaya yaa sirf chunavi saal main 300 rupaya bonus dene kaa elaan hua
 Are farmers getting a bonus of Rs 300 per quintal this year too
 2018 ke ghoshnaa patr main bijepi ne bataaya he ki bijepi sarkaar ne 15 saal main dhan or bonus raashi milakar kisaanon ko 76,000 karod die hai
 That is, every year spent 5066 crore on the purchase of paddy

 Farming budget 183 in 2003–4
 98 karod tha
 It is written that the number of irrigation pumps in the state has increased from 72000 to 5 lakhs and loans have been provided to the farmers without interest
 bijepi ne kaha he ki 7
 3 lakh farmers have availed interest free loan
 iske liye rajya sarkaar ne 184 karod kaa anudaan diya he
 In December 2017, the Home Minister of Chhattisgarh replied in the assembly that 1344 farmers have committed suicide in the last two and a half years
 is baar bijepi ne vaada kiya he ki 'kisaanon ko bina byaaz kaa rin diya jayega
 Proper arrangement for procurement of paddy and maize at the minimum support price of farmers, bonus to farmers at Rs 300 per quintal
 sabhi mandiyon ko i-naam se joda jayega
 100 percent trade will be ensured in e-name
 27 zilon main gramin krishi bazaar kii sthapana kii jaaegi
 ' har zile main cold storage banane kii baat kahi gai he
 How many districts have cold storage built, is not known
 60 saal se upar kii umr ke laghu or seemaant kisaanon or bhoomihin krishi mazaduron ko 1000 rupee kii masik pension di jaaegi
 Is it any different, has it not been given earlier, what was the amount of pension at that time
 2013 ke ghoshnaa patr main bhi tha ki chhattisgarh ko dugdh utpaadan main sarplus state banaaenge
 The 2018 manifesto states that the Dairy Revolution Campaign will be launched
 2013 ke vaade kaa kya hua
 Did Chhattisgarh become a surplus state in milk production? 2013 main bijepi ne kaha tha ki chhattisgarh ko krishi rajdhani banaaenge, kya aisi koi rajdhani bani, or ye kahaan he
 Chhattisgarh is not among the top five states in 2018
 chhattisgarh main congress kaa vaada dekh lete hai
 The debt of the farmers will be waived within ten days of the formation of the government
 yah saaf nahin he ki karza maaf karne kii sharten kya hongi, kis raashi tak kaa karza maaf hoga
 The farmers' outstanding paddy of two years will be made in bonus installments

 From the crops whose minimum support price was released by the central government in July, we have seen in the Congress manifesto that whether the Congress is promising higher prices
 dhan kaa kul nunatam samarthan mulya 1750 rupee prati quintal he
 The Congress has promised 2500 per quintal in Chhattisgarh
 centre sarkaar ne makka ke liye 1700 rupee prati quintal bhav tay kiya he

 If farmers want to live separately then they can be different
 bina karz liye kheti karne vaale bhi fasal beemaa se judenge
 On the recommendation of Gram Sabha, farmers will get the benefit of crop insurance
 tippaniyan Congress has launched Sardar Ballabhbhai Patel Kisan Putra Swavalamban Yojana
 kisi ne notice nahin kiya ki congress ke ghoshnaptr main gau mutr hi nahin, sardaar vallabh bhai patel ke naam par ek yojana bhi aa gai he
 Under this, unemployed youth living in villages will be given loans at a cheaper rate for work like animal husbandry dairy
 unhen 1 karod tak kaa rin dilaayenge or sinchai kar main chhot denge, ve apana utpaada kahin bhi bech sakenge or mandi kar nahin lagegaa
 Congress has another promise
 dugdh utpaadak sangh ke madhyam se dugdh utpaadakon ko 5 rupee prati litre bonus denge
 The Congress has also promised 1000 monthly pension to farmers above 60 years of Madhya Pradesh like the BJP in Chhattisgarh
 hamane sari baaten to yahaan nahin likhi he lekin in ghoshnaa patron ko padhate hue kya yah samajha ja saktaa he ki kisaanon kii samasya ko lekar congress or bijepi kuch thos samaadhaan pesh kar rahi hai
 Their understanding is expanding
