 The Maharashtra government sent a proposal to the Center in the last week of last month to provide a grant of Rs 100 per quintal to the farmer who has sold onions in the government mandi
 is anudaan kaa aadha vyay centre ko uthaanaa tha or aadha rajya sarkaar ko
 The total expenditure was estimated at Rs 65 crore
 isamen se centre kii tijori se 32 karod 50 lakh rupye kharch hone the
 The comments buudhvaar kii baithak se baahar nikalate hue maharashtra ke vipanan mantri subhash deshmukh ne media karmiyon ko bataaya ki centre ne rajya sarkaar kaa prastaav thukraa diya he kyonki is tarah se anudaan dene kii koi skim centre ke paas he hi nahin
 The desperation was evident in Deshmukh's statement
 maharashtra main is baar 15 lakh ton pyaaj kaa utpaadan hua he
 This production has suffered from recent floods and crises such as merchant versus farmer
 jisase pyaaj ke daam jameen par utar gaye
 In such a situation, a proposal to give subsidy came on the initiative of Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari to provide relief to the farmers
 lekin is prastaav ko ramvilas paswan kii taraf se nakaare jane par ab rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ke saamne kisaanon kaa gussa jhelane kaa sankat aa khadaa he
 To avoid this, the Maharashtra government has requested to increase the import subsidy to 5% per quintal given to onion exporters and approve subsidy per quintal of the farmer
 ab rajya sarkaar ko dubaara apana prastaav centre ko bhejnaa hoga

 Coming out of Wednesday's meeting, Maharashtra Marketing Minister Subhash Deshmukh told media persons that the Center has turned down the proposal of the state government as the Center does not have any such grant scheme
 deshmukh ke bayaan main hataasha saaf jhalak rahi thi
 This time 15 lakh tonnes of onions have been produced in Maharashtra
 is utpaadan ko haal hi main baadh or vyapaaree banaam kisaan jaise sankat jhelane pade
 Due to which onion prices hit the ground
 aise main kisaanon ko raahat dene ke liye kendriya sadak parivahan mantri nitin gadakari kii pahal par sabsidi dene kaa prastaav saamne aayaa tha
 But after rejecting this proposal from Ram Vilas Paswan, now there is a crisis facing the farmers' anger in front of the BJP government of the state
 isse bachane ke liye maharashtra sarkaar ne pyaaj ke niryaatkon ko di ja rahi prati quintal 5% emport sabsidi ko badhaane or kisaan kii prati quintal sabsidi ko manjuuri dene kii guzarish kii he
 Now the state government will have to send its proposal again to the center

 doctor
 Today, a nationwide peaceful satyagraha was launched to pay homage to Ambedkar and to enact a new law from both the Houses of Parliament for the complete destruction of caste from the country
 dilli sahit 153 shaharon main lagbhag 525 se adhik jagah par deshvyapee shantipurna satyagrah kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 Hundreds of people who gathered near Amar Jawan Jyoti at Delhi's India Gate shouted slogans
 WIFE is determined to remove casteism, racist slogans of Murdabad, Vande Mataram with candles in their hands
 uske baad ye kafila amar jawan jyoti ke chakkar lagaakar ek jansabha main tabdeel ho gaya jahaan logon ne jatvaad ko khatm karne ke liye shapath lee
 On this occasion, Dr
 Kaushal Kant Mishra, the National President of Youth for Equality said that Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar had said on 26 November 1949 - Caste is anti-national because it brings a divide in social life
 jati anti neshnal isliye bhi he kyonki ye jati ke bich irshyaa or ghrinaa paidaa karti he
 How can a people divided into so many thousand castes be a nation
 or sabhi deshavaasiyon ko is saamaajik andolan kaa hissaa banane ke liye aavan kiya he
 He said that the first non-political satyagraha of its kind has been started in the entire country, which aims to pass a law for complete annihilation of castes from Parliament by 2020
 mishan 2020 main desh kii bahut sari gaiyr raajnneetik sansthaayen shaamil hai jo alag-alag shahar main YFE ke mishan 2020 ko safal banane ke liye ek saath aae hai
 He further said that a lot of people asked me on social media, why don't you remove Mishra himself and you talk about removing caste
 uske jawaab main kaushal mishra ne kaha ki, mere yaa mere parivaar yaa phir puri dilli ke sarnem hataane se yadi ye ho saktaa to shaayad ye main or meri dilli kar chuki hoti
 But even after the activism of organizations active in annihilating caste for hundreds of years, caste has not ended because all these efforts have been done socially but no law has been made till date
 bina kanoon ke jati khatam nahin ho sakati
 At the same time, he announced that he is going to give an application soon to remove Mishra from all his government papers, which will aim to rise above caste and die for society and live with society

 In referring to Congress President Sonia Gandhi's 'death dealer' comment about Modi, BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said that today Rahul Gandhi has become a 'merchant of untruth'
 audyogic sanvardhan evam niti vibhaag kii ore se taiyaar is report kaa zikr karte hue nirmala ne kaha ki har raily main congress upaadhyaksh ne 'toffee model' kii baat karte hue kaha ki ek rupee main toffee mil jaati he, lekin gujarat main aapako ek rupee main bhoomi mil jaaegi jabaki report main gujarat ke model kii saraahna karte hue iske bhoomi adhigrahan model ko anukaraniya bataaya gaya he
 He said, 'where is Rahul Gandhi now? Where is he now His own government today said that Gujarat's land acquisition policy is exemplary, from the platform you were telling something to the whole world, which your own government does not confirm
 ' Nirmala said, 'AAP (rahul) kept speaking untruth from the stage as part of his election campaign
 
 
 unke bhaashan lekhakon ne unhen is bare main nahin bataaya
 ' nirmala ne kaha ki congress ko is tarah kaa asaty bolne ke liye maafee maangani chahie kyonki usne janata ko gumraah kiya he
 Objecting to the propaganda against Narendra Modi and the BJP, Nirmala sought a response from the Commerce and Industry Minister in this regard
 unhone kaha, 'chaahe kuposhan ho yaa muthbhed, gujarat ko hameshaa nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Whatever is related to Modi and Gujarat, it is said to be untrue
 ' Nirmala said that we object to this and take it seriously
 mantri anand sharma ko is bare main jawaab dena chahie
 Taking a dig at Priyanka Gandhi for her remarks on 'low-level politics', Nirmala questioned Rahul whether there was a vile thinking about the development model of Gujarat? He said that the intention of Congress is to stop Modi at any cost
 lekin aisa karte hue usee kaa din-ba-din pardaafash hota ja rahaa he
 The situation does not seem to be clear about the seat-sharing in the state between the BJP and Shiv Sena before the Maharashtra Assembly Election
 aise main yah ek bada sawaal bana hua he ki kya is baar donon partiyanek gathbandhan ke taur par hi chunaav ladenge yaa donon partiyaan sabhi siton par apane alag se ummidavaar utaaregi
 a source associated with the bjp-shiv Sena alliance told NDTV that the BJP wants to play the role of an elder brother before the elections in the state
 or agar aisa hota he shivasena ko aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main 288 siton kii vidhansabha main se 120 se zyada siten nahin di jaaengi
 At the same time, news is also coming that the Shiv Sena is not considering breaking this alliance but it can go it alone in this election
 haalanki aadhikarik taur par kuch bhi nahin kaha gaya he
 a source close to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said that whatever is being talked about the alliance behind the scenes so far is so clear that the Chief Minister of the state, Devendra Fadnavis, this time on the formula of 50-50 percent sharing of seats Will not agree
 yahi vajah he ki kuch din pehle fadanvis ne ishaaron hi ishaaron main kaha tha ki abhi tak seat bantwaare ko lekar kuch bhi tay nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 He had said that if bjp-shiv Sena has to fight as a coalition, then we always have to keep in mind that we will get something and we will not get anything
 gauratlab he ki seat bantwaare se pehle shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare anuchhed 370 ko lekar centre sarkaar kii tarif kii thi
 He also demanded to build a Ram temple
 unhone kaha tha kiab ram mandir ke liye intjaar karne kaa koi matlab nahin banataa he
 Thackeray had said that we have told Shiv Sena workers that he has been ready
 ab samay aa gaya he jab ram mandir kii aadharshila ayodhya main rakhi jaaegi
 This is the issue which was brought up by our founder Balasaheb Thackeray
 uddhav thakare ne aage kaha tha ki jis tarah se sarkaar kaam kar rahi he, usne hamaari ummiden badha di hai ki sarkaar jald hi ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan karaayegi
 Now there is no vote to wait
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan uddhav thakare ne ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar bijepi par kai baar hamalaa bolaa tha
 He said that from the way the Modi government has worked in the last five years, it does not seem from anywhere that it is serious in any way about the construction of Ram temple
 gauratlab he kimaharashtra main asann vidhansabha chunaav ladane ke liye siton ke bantwaare par sattarudh bhaajapa or shivasena ke apana rukh sakht karne kii khabaron ke bich shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne kaha tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii upasthiti main, donon dalon kaa gathbandhan ‘‘atal'' he or yah gathbandhan ek baar phir se satta main vaapasi karegaa
 During his address at an event in Mumbai, Thackeray praised the Prime Minister for abolishing most of the provisions of Article 370 and appealed to build a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya and bring in a uniform civil code
 thakare ne kaha tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne desh ko netritv or disha pradaan kii he jisamen pragati or vikaas karne kii apaar kshamta he
 i congratulate Modi for ending most of the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution and for the Chandrayaan-2 campaign
 
 
 ab raashtra ayodhya main bhavy ram mandir kaa nirmaan tathaa samaan naagarik samhita kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 He said that Kashmir is and will remain an integral part of India
 piem modi ne ise na keval shabdon main balki vaastaviktaa main siddh kar diya he
 Thackeray had said that the country is also proud of ISRO scientists for the ambitious moon mission
 bharat main apaar kshamta he, or modi main, desh ko (sahi) disha dene vaala netritv mila he
 Thackeray also said that an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party would continue

 The five-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Dipak Mishra in its judgment on September 28 in the judgment of women aged between 10 and 50 years in the temple of Lord Ayyappa in Sabarimala, Kerala
 Canceled the age-old practice of prohibiting entry
 court ne kaha ki is pabandi par muhar lagane vaale kerala hindu saarvajanik puja sthal (pravesh kaa adhikaar) niyam, 1965 ke praavdhaan dharmaparayan hindu mahilaon ke adhikaron kaa ulanghan hai
 Justice R
 epa
 Nariman and D
 vaai
 Chandrachud gave his separate verdicts but he was the Chief Justice and Justice A
K
 em
 Khanwilkar used to agree with his views, while Indu Malhotra, the only woman judge on the bench, ruled the disagreement
 isse pehle kerala hycourt ne mahilaon ke mandir main pravesh par pabandi ke praavdhaan ko is aadhaar par jaij tehraaya tha ki sirf peethasin mukhya pujari ko hi paramparaon ke bare main faisla karne kaa adhikaar he
 This decision of the High Court was challenged in the Supreme Court by the Indian Young Lawyers Association and others and argued that this tradition is based on the concept of impurity in the menstrual period of women and is therefore discriminatory
 justise chandrachud ne kaha ki mahilaon par is tarah kii pabandi unki inasaani garima kaa ulanghan he
 It is the responsibility of the court to uphold the constitutional ethics contained in the Preamble of the Constitution which is based on the principles of equality, freedom and human dignity
 so, court ne faisla sunaaya ki sabarimala mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh par roak bhedbhaavpurn he
 The judges stated that the ban on the entry of women is due to non-religious reasons and is not part of the core elements of Hindu religious traditions
 justise chandrachud ne anuchhed 14 or 15 (samanta or bhedbhaav ke viruddh) or anuchhed 25 or 26 (kisi dharmik samooh yaa mat ke apni khaas pratha or puja vidhi tay karne ke adhikaar) ke bich maheen santulan kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki nyaayadhish dharmaguru nahin hai isliye unhen kisi rasm yaa parampara ko keval sanvaidhanik naitikta ke aadhaar par parakhnaa chahie
 This judgment clearly places individual liberty above group rights and also expressly expresses the standards of constitutional justice
 yah rajya kii jimmedaari he ki vah swatantraaa, samanta or garima ko kaayam rakhe
 The decision also makes it clear that the state should not favor those practices which do not agree with these values
 faisla dharm ke mul tatwon or uske itar prathaon ke sawaal main court ke ulajhane kii anivaaryta ko bhi ghataata he
 The Chief Justice (on which Justice Khanwilkar agreed with him) said that no discrimination can be done in a piety case and patriarchal beliefs should be changed
 justise nariman kaa kahana tha ki is tarah kii bhedbhaavpurn prathaen sabhi pracheen dharmon main prachlan main hai
 These traditions deprive women of dignity and make them inferior
 justise malhotra kaa maananaa tha ki "sati'' jaisi saamaajik buraai ke muddon ko chhodkar baaki maamalon main yah tay karnaa court kaa kaam nahin he ki koun-si dharmik prathaon ko khatm kiya janaa chahie
 He said, "the court should not normally interfere in issues with deep religious sentiments
 sabarimala mandir or bhagwaan ayyappa ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 25 ke tahat suraksha praapt he or dharmik manyataon ko anuchhed 14 ke aadhaar par hi nahin parkhaa ja saktaa
 "he added," It is up to the religious community to decide which religious beliefs are mandatory and not the court
 bharat vividh samskritiyon kaa desh he
 Constitutional ethics must allow everyone to conduct according to their faith
 court ko isamen tab tak dakhal nahin dena chahie jab tak ki us samudaay yaa dharm se koi peedit vyakti is bare main aage na aae
 This decision of disagreement raises the question of social change through the intervention of the court
 mahilaon ke prati bhedbhaavkaari paramparaayen sabhi jagah pai jaati hai
 Recently, Muslim women in Mumbai acquired the right of entry into the Mukti Room of the historic Haji Ali dargah on the grounds that the ban was recently arbitrarily imposed as many dargahs would allow women to enter the inner chamber

 Women were not allowed to enter the Shani Shingnapur temple in Ahmednagar despite court orders as temple committee members said that this would annoy Shani Dev and increase the incidence of rape
 desh main kai anya mandir mahilaon ke pravesh par pabandi lagaate hai
 Muslim women are not allowed to offer prayers in many mosques, and Roman Catholic women cannot play the role of clergy
 in sari paabandiyon main sajhi baat pitrusatta he jo mahilaon kii ashuddhta kii avadharana par aadhaarit he or phir yahi mahilaon ko unke haq se vanchit karne kaa auchity ban jaati he
 Another common thing in this is the concept that women are seductive and have the power to subdue men
 isi main hauva kaa baar-baar pesh kiya jane vaala yah roopankan he, jisane aadam ko paap karne ke liye uksaakar maanavjaati kaa patan kar diya or phir jise swarg se hameshaa ke liye nishkasit kar diya gaya
 This concept continues to be the point of establishment in all civilizations and religions
 aisa prathit hota he ki yah avadharana sabhyataa ke baad ke daur main sthapit kii gai jab pitrusatta apni jaden jamaa rahi thi or rajnatik satta raajaaon, saamanton or paariwarik vanshpradhanon ke haathon main simtane lagi thi
 Private ownership of agricultural land was taking place, and it was replacing the old privilege of collecting food in which collective life and shared ownership of land were the most important things
 sambhavatya isi sankraman kaal ke dauraan mahilaon ne apni shreshthata kii vah sthiti kho di, jo sabhyataa kii shuruyaat se kaayam thi
 It was believed that women had a special fertility power and their menstrual cycle is a tangible form of this power that corresponds to the cycle of the Moon's fluctuation
 lihaaja, jameen main boe jane vaale beej bhi jivan dene vaale maahvaaree ke raktasrav ke saath milakar daale jate the
 Our myths and folklore are full of depictions of strong and powerful women
 mahila takat kaa moort rup thi—shakti—jo dushton kaa naash kar sakati thi
 Feminist anthropologists and historians believe that patriarchy introduced the notion of women's uncleanness in order to maintain the superiority of men
 dhire-dhire jab pitrusatta ne apni jaden jamaani shuru kin to mahilaon ko chikitsa or bhavishyavaanee karne kii unki takat ke lae pratadit kiya jane laga or madhyakaal main kai aarogyasadhikaaon or daayiyon aadi ko chudail bataakar jala diya jane laga
 We should also evaluate what the impact of this decision will have on the grassroots-based discriminations that have persisted for centuries and which women themselves have assimilated within themselves
 vidambnaa kii baat yah he ki is samaadhaan kii maang karne vaale tarkshastri khud bhagwaan ayyappa ke adarsh "shraddhalu'' nahin hai
 Actually, the taboo about menstruation prevails in the same way among educated upper class families in urban India
 haalanki is par bahes ho sakati he ki kya nyaayik faisle ke jariye dharmik paramparaon or reeti-rivaajon main badlaav laayaa ja saktaa he
 In this case, The News Minute was quoted as saying by Ready to Weight Campaign spokesperson Padma Pillai that the decision would not have any impact on the ground level
 unka kahana tha, "sidhi baat yah he ki nijee taur par mere liye or mere jaise shraddhaluon ke liye is faisle se kuch nahin badalegaa

 Just as sophisticated as Justice Chandrachud's verdict, he tries to unravel the threads of Hinduism
 pratap bhanu mehta ne ek jaij sawaal kiya he, "kisi vyakti kii haisiyat ko nuksaan pahunchane kii vah koun-si pratyaksh seemaa he jiske aage rajya ko dakhal dena chahie? aakhir rajya ko hi har galati durust nahin kerani chahie
 The church cannot have a female pastor, it is discriminatory
 lekin kya rajya ko use aisa karne ke liye kahana chahie? chandrachud ke faisle se yah abhas hota he ki rajya ko har us samay dakhal dena chahie jab use aisi kisi saanskrithik parampara kaa pataa chale jo halke se bhi asamanta kii vichaardhaara ko pratipaadit karti ho
 "they also say that Justice Malhotra was right in thinking that it would be like fully implementing the state's vote in the name of social reforms

 ' loksabhaa kaa netaa vipaksh kaa maamla supreme court pahunch gaya he
 While hearing the petition regarding the appointment of Lokpal, the Supreme Court has sent a notice to the Central Government

 The Supreme Court said that the post of Leader of Opposition is important in the Lokpal selection process, so the government should consider Leader Opposition
 agar sarkaar netaa vipaksh ke vivaad ko sulajhane main naakaam rahati he, to wo nirnaayak faisla suna sakati he
 The Supreme Court asked Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi two questions
 sarkaar lokapal kanoon ko kis tarah se lagu karne ja rahi he?2
 For the appointment of the Lokpal panel, the leader of the opposition is required under the current law
 agar netaa vipaksh nahin he to aisi sthiti main wo kis tarah se aage badhane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Referring to the importance of the Leader of the Opposition, the Supreme Court said that this post puts forward the point of the party other than the government in the House
 lokapal kii niyukti main bhi netaa vipaksh kii bhoomika ahm he isliye sarkaar ko is par vichaar karnaa chahie
 The Supreme Court made it clear that 9 September will be the last hearing on the case
 netaa vipaksh mudde or lokapal bill ko thande baste main nahin daalaa ja saktaa
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Prashant Bhushan had brought to the notice of the Supreme Court the delay in the appointment of Lokpal

 Gujarat Congress in-charge Gurudas Kamat was removed from the post on Wednesday
 unki jagah rajasthan ke purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ko prabhaar diya gaya he
 Assembly elections are due in Gujarat this year, but Gurudas Kamat failed to check factionalism in the party
 isi vajah se unhen pad se hataa diya gaya
 For the last few days, there has been an uproar in the Congress over the candidature for the post of Chief Minister in Gujarat
 kuch din pehle gurudas kaamat gujarat aae the, tab vah ambaji mandir ke darshan ke liye gaye the
 At that time, several mlas who supported Shankarsinh Vaghela met him and demanded that Vaghela be declared the chief ministerial candidate
 tippaniyan Vaghela, however, remained silent on the issue and publicly stated that some mlas had come to meet him, were also senior people of the party and had a meaningful conversation about how to face the bjp's challenge
 unke mutabik isamen na to gutbazi jaisi koi thi or na hi koi nakaaratmak baat thi
 It is also important that State Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki went abroad at that time
 aate hi unhen bhi is gutbazi kii jaankaree mili thi or rahul gandhi ko fariyaad bhi kii gai thi
 Allegations were also made that Kamat was provoking factionalism by meeting people separately
 bharatsingh ne mukhyamantri pad par to kuch nahin kaha tha, lekin kaha ki netritv kaa faisla sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi karenge
 It is becoming common discussion that the Congress is claiming a tough fight against the BJP in Gujarat on one hand, but it is very upset with the factionalism before the elections
 pichley kuch dinon se gujarat main mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaari ko lekar congress main ghamaasan machaa hua he
 a few days ago Gurudas Kamat came to Gujarat when he went to visit the Ambaji temple
 us samay shankarasingh waghela ke samarthak kai vidhayakon ne unase mulaakaat kii thi or waghela ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne kii maang kii thi
 The comments waghela haalanki is mudde par chup hi rahe or saarvajanik rup se yahi kaha ki kuch emele unase milane aae the, party ke senior log bhi the or unase is bare main sarthak baatcheet hui bijepi kii chunauti kaa kis tarah se saamana kiya jaae
 According to him, there was neither factionalism nor any negative thing in it
 mahatvapurn ye bhi he ki us vakt rajya congress pramukh bharatsingh solanki videsh gaye hue the
 As soon as he came, he too got information about this factionalism and Rahul Gandhi was also requested
 aarope ye bhi lage the ki kaamat alag se logon se milakar gutbaji ko uksaa rahe hai
 Bharatsinh did not say anything on the post of Chief Minister, but said that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will decide the leadership
 ye charchaa aam ho rahi he ki congress ek taraf gujarat main bhaajapa kaa kadaa muqabla karne kaa daawa kar rahi he, lekin chunaavon se pehle hi gutbazi se vah kaaphi pareshaan he
 Vaghela, however, remained silent on the issue and publicly stated that some mlas had come to meet him, were also senior people of the party and had a meaningful conversation about how to face the bjp's challenge

 '' If India does not return the Italian Marine, Italy will make public the conversation of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which he allegedly sought information against Sonia Gandhi
 yah daawa chrishchiyan mishael ne kiya he
 Significantly, Mitchell's name is coming up as a middleman in the agustawestland helicopter deal case
 NDTV ko die ek khaas saakshaatkaar main mishael ne salaah di he ki hatya ke aaropee marine ko agar nahin lautaaya gaya to itavali sarkaar "kuch aisa kar sakati he" jo bharat ko "acha na lage"

" italy kii sarkaar nai he or uske paas marine maamla sulajhane kaa mauka he
 For the advice given to resolve the matter in the meeting, it would have been presumed that Mrs Gandhi was involved in this, whereas it was not
 main jaanata hum ki ye thodaa jatil hoga
 On the possibility of India sending the Italian naval back, Mitchell said that the talks cannot be successful when the basis of negotiation is wrong, the PM is in a very bad position
 So the Italian government will make the meeting public by getting angry with them

 Mitchell admitted that there was no such meeting during the UN Conference in New York
 "main us anaupchaarik mulaakaat ke bare main kah rahaa hum jise aadhikarik taur par aasaani se nakaara ja saktaa he

 Two Italian marines are accused of killing Indian fishermen in 2012, while one moved to Italy due to poor health and the other is in Delhi
 italy kaa kahana he ki machuaaron ne marinon ko samudri daaku samaj liya tha
 The comments mishael ne NDTV se kaha ki "ve (italy) congress ke marine maamle main asahyog se khush nahin hai
 The Italian government is new and has a chance to resolve the marines case

 In the agustawestland deal case, the role of alleged bribe bribe was again in the news following the Milan court's decision
 pichley maheene hi milan ke ek court ne agasta ke kuch salaahkaaron or adhikariyon ke patron or nots ke aadhaar par nishkarsh diya tha ki maamle main rishwat di gai thi 
 Mitchell admitted that one of those documents belonged to him in which Sonia Gandhi was described as the "driving force" in deciding whether to pick up helicopters for top leaders
 " usne jor diya ki shrimati gandhi ko koi rishwat nahin di gai or unki shakti ko dekh kar lamabandi kii suchi main unhen sabase upar rakhana swaabhaavik tha
 Mitchell told NDTV that "they (italy) are not happy with the non-cooperation in the Congress Marines case
" italy kii sarkaar nai he or uske paas marine maamla sulajhane kaa mauka he
 For the advice given to resolve the matter in the meeting, it would have been presumed that Mrs Gandhi was involved in this, whereas it was not
 main jaanata hum ki ye thodaa jatil hoga
 On the possibility of India sending the Italian naval back, Mitchell said that the talks cannot be successful when the basis of negotiation is wrong, the PM is in a very bad position
 So the Italian government will make the meeting public by getting angry with them
 agasta westland deal maamle main kathith rup se bichauliye kii rishwat dene main bhoomika kaa maamla milan court ke faisle ke baad phir se surkhiyon main aa gaya tha
 Only last month, a Milan court concluded on the basis of letters and notes from some of Augusta's advisors and officials that a bribe had been given in the case
 mishael ne mana ki unamem se ek dastavej uskaa he jisamen bade netaaon ke liye helicopter lene ke liye sonia gandhi ko nirnay lene main " sanchaalak shakti " bataaya tha

 ravivaar ko asia kaa sabase bada kapadaa thok bazaar gandhi nagar kaa najaara badla-badla sa saath tha
 It is usually very difficult to walk in the streets of Gandhi Nagar
 lekin jiesti lagu hone ke baad ravivaar ko bazaar suunaa suunaa tha
 Roads that are difficult to walk
 vahaan aaraam se car chal rahi thi
 That too without hindrance
 shuukravaar ko jiesti se puraa desh ek single kaaman market main tabdeel ho gaya
 The government has called it second independence
 lekin is aazaadee se deshbhar ke kapadaa vyapaariyon ko sabase zyada mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 There was no tax on the GSTC fabric on clothes
 lekin jiesti ke lagu hone se kapadaa bhi tex ke daayre main aa gaya
 The traders say that the government should have trained the traders and cas thoroughly before implementing GST
 jisase vyapaar karne main kisi tarah kaa koi gatirodh naa utpan ho
 But with the implementation of GST, there is a significant impact on everyday work
 kya he kapadaa vyapaariyon kii pareshaanijisti lagane se kapadaa vyapaariyon ko kaaphi pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Textile trader Amit Agarwal says that how to deliver the goods to your warehouse and how to bring the goods from the warehouse to the shop
 kisi vyapaaree kaa godaam 5 se 10 kilometre kii duusari par he
 So under which bill will the goods be transported
 agar vyapaaree ko kuch saamana apane ghar le janaa ho to wo kin kaagaj ke boote maal ko baahar nikaalega
 Earlier there was no tax of any kind on clothes, so there was no problem in bringing and carrying it
 isaki jaankaree vyapaariyon ke saath-saath sie tak ke paas nahin hai
 In this situation, there are many problems
 jobawork main aa rahi he dikkatajisti lagu hone kii vajah se kapadaa vyapaariyon ko jobawork main sabase zyada dikkat aa rahi he
 a merchant bought a thread and made a cloth out of that thread
 phir rangai ke liye diya
 In this case, under which format of GST, this process will be brought under the purview of GST
 yah bhi vyapaariyon ko nahin pataa
 Our CA is not aware of the saying of textile trader Sanjay Aggarwal
 phir kiske paas jaaen
 Sanjay said that if we go on assuming that thread has imposed 5 percent GST, netting also has five percent GST and dyeing has also imposed five percent
 lekin diar ke chemical main par to 18 fisadi laga jiesti laga he
 According to this, how will the good cloth be sold? isaki jaankaree naa to sarkaar ne di or naa hi sie ke paas he
 There is no information about the textile traders are troubled
 The traders said that if the government had provided complete information before implementing the GST, then there was no problem
 kuch vyapaariyon ko lagata he ki do lakh se neeche vaale vyapaariyon ko jiesti number nahin lenaa hoga
 The government has not yet cleared it
 iskaa rifund vyapaariyon ko milegaa yaa nahin
 Due to all these types of problems, the traders are having to face two to four
 vyapaariyon kaa manana he ki ek sahi system or vyapaariyon ko acchhee tarah se training dene ke baad jiesti ko lagu karnaa chahie
 When GST is implemented, there are many rules that even CA does not know well
 jab sie ko hi kuch nahin maaloom hoga to aam vyapaaree ise kaise lagu kar paaegaa

 upi ke meerut main mahatma gandhi ke hatyarenathuram godseki pratimaa sthapit karne ko lekar machaa bavaal abhi thama bhi nahin tha kirajasthan ke alvaramein ek pul ko godse kaa naam de diya gaya
 The 750-meter-long flyover in Alwar in the NCR region had a plaque written on it, which was written by Tharatist Nathuram Godsepul
 yah fliover alvar shahar ke bhagat singh cirkil ko agrasen cirkil se jodta he
 However, the plaque was removed after media queries
 angreji akhbaar da times of india ne is aashay kii khabar prakashit kii he
 Significantly, the construction of this bridge was approved by the Ashok Gehlot government of Congress in 2012

 It is believed that this bridge will be inaugurated in the coming days

 After this, after consulting with his political and bureaucratic rulers, Collector Mahavir Swamy sent a team of officers to remove the plaque on the bridge
 alvar ke colector ne kaha ki yah kuch asaamaajik tatwon kaa kaam he, jo sampradayik tanaav failaana chaahate hai
 However, the collector could not answer how the plaque was installed on the flyover without the knowledge of the administration and the workers
 pahaado main jitani barf nahin giri he usase kahin zyaada dilli main satta ke galiyaaron main barf gir rahi he
 The snowflake has been falling in Delhi for two days but no one wants to talk about it
 ek aisi report ai he jise lekar padhane waalon kii saansen jam jaati hai, jo bhi padhata he apana phone band kar detaa he ki kahin koi is par pratikriya na maang le
 Except this report, journalists are tweeting the rest of the report in a haphazard manner so that the dust settles on this snowball as soon as possible
 bahut mushkil se niranjan taakale naam ke ek reporter ne ek jaj kii laash par jami dhul kii parat hataa kar ye report chhaapi he, bahut aasaani se us report ko yah dilli barf kii silli ke neeche dabaa dena chaahati he
 But this report is slowly reaching from one place to another in the cellars of What's Up
 angrezi main chhapi is lambii report ko padhate hi pathak dar ke aise andhere kuen main khud ko girtaa hua mahasoos karne lagata he, jahaan uski cheekh bhi uske paas nahin pahunch paati he

 Are the questions related to the death of a CBI judge really cause such a hole in the story that you have to hear a killer laughing across that hole, his laughter seems to be recognized but the name does not come on the tongue
 is report kaa asar kisi rahasyamayi thriller sa he jise patrakarita ke course main padhaayaa janaa chahie
 Those who are studying journalism by paying five lakh fees should project on it
 kai baar vaazib kaarnon se bhi hota he ki duusare santhaan kii story ko haath lagane se pehle intazaar karte hai
 This is completely fine as well, but surprisingly, even after two days of printing, no sound was heard from the corridors of the courts
 mumkin he kisi ne padhi na ho
 Where should the judges have time, if they had studied, what should they have done, can the file of questions related to the death of a judge not open again
 adaalat ko, kanoon mantri ko, desh ke kaaryakari sangrakshak pradhanmantri ko kya yah aashwaasan apni taraf se nahin dena chahie tha
 Shouldn't the opposition have questioned
 kya sabko yah aashwaasan nahin dena chahie ki ham is kii jaanch karenge varanaa nyaaypalika ke bheetar ke logon kaa apane kaam se bharosa uth jayega, varna nyaaypalika ke baahar ke logon kaa bheetar baithe logon par bharosa nahin rahegaa
 The wife became silent on the death of her husband and son
 unka dar vaazib hi rahaa hoga, magar justise loya kii doctor bahan ne teen saal baad kehane kii himmat juta lee
 But when a sister spoke, a reporter printed the report, a magazine gave it to the people, then why is the snow capped on the tongue of journalists and people of justice in Delhi
 story daraavnee to he
 i have seen journalists reading this story in awe
 main khud sihar gaya ki kya ek jaj kii maut vaaki maut thi yaa kisi ne hatya kar di
 On the morning of 1 December 2014 in Nagpur, Judge Brijgopal Loya is reported to have died of a heart attack
 teen saal baad unki bahan ke sawaal haddiyon main chhed kar dete hai, lagata he ki unki kisi ne hatya kar di or hatyara aaraam se tivi dekh rahaa he
 He must have read the caravan story secretly
 mumkin he is story par pardaa daalane ke liye dilli main hindu muslim muddon kii aandhi chal jaae, aise masale aa jaaen jahaan tivi par moulana or ankaron ke bich jang chhid jaae lekin jab bhi aandhi thamati he wo story jhalkane lagati he
 It is also an obligation of journalism when all the people leave a story dead and then return to it after a long time and see if there was any more clue
 aap niranjan taakale kii is story ko caravanmagazine
 can read on com
 angrezi main he or lambii bhi he
 Scroll it after the caravan
 in or the wire
 in has also printed hindi main aap the wirehindi
 com, mediavigil
 com par is story ko pard sakate hai
 indiasamvad
 co
 in has also added a new angle to this story
 kannada akhbaar vaartabharati or malayalam main chhapane vaala akhbaar madhyamum ne is report ko cover kiya he
 Dew are in the offices of newspapers in Delhi
 kairavaan kii is story kii jaanch hamane apane str par nahin kii magar jab sibiai ke jaj brijagopal loya kii bahan kaa video bayaan dekha to laga ki kam se kam jaisi story he use us rup main bataaya ja saktaa he
 CBI Special Court Judge Brijgopal Loya was hearing the Sohrabuddin encounter case in which BJP national president Amit Shah was the main accused
 30 disambar 2014 ko sibiai ke special sibiai jaj embi gosaavi amit shah ko is aarope se bari kar dete hai
 The CBI did not appeal against this decision in the Upper Court
 apil karne kaa iraadaa he bhi yaa nahin, koun poochhega
 When people get scared of a printed story, who will ask why the appeal is not being made
 6 june 2014 ko special jaj utpat naaraazgi zaahir karte hai ki amit shah kyon nahin aae
 The judge orders that Amit Shah should appear in court on June 20, not come
 jaj utpat agali sunwaayee kii tarikh 26 june tay karte hai magar 25 june ko unka tabadalaa ho jaataa he
 The Supreme Court has ordered that the same officer in the Sohrabuddin case will remain in the investigation and hearing from beginning to end
 jaj utpat kaa tabadalaa pune ho jaataa he
 In his place comes 48 years Judge Brijgopal Harikshan Loya
 jaj loya amit shah ko nijee taur par haazir hone kii shart se chhot de dete hai
 It is said that they wanted to revisit the charge sheet of ten thousand pages, new judges were so and case sensitive as well
 unke saath rahane vaali bhanji nupur ne bataaya he ki is cese ko lekar bahut tanaav he
 There are many people involved in how to understand it
 isse kaise nipta jaae
 Bhanji told this to Niranjan Takle, a reporter for Caravan
 usee ke baad se niranjan ne is kahani kii padtaal shuru kar di
 On October 31, Judge Loya asked why Amit Shah is not present
 shah ke vakil kehete hai ki unhone khud haazir naa hone kii chhot di he
 Loya reminds that the exemption was when Shah was outside the state, on that day Shah was in Mumbai
 1 disambar 2014 kii subah nagpur main justise loya kii maut hoti he
 On December 15, 2014, Amit Shah was to appear before Judge Loya
 30 disambar ko nae jaj emji gosaavi amit shah ko sabhi aaropon se bari kar dete hai
 The verdict states that Amit Shah was implicated for political reasons
 jaj kii maut vaali story main amit shah kaa zikr sirf sandarbh kii baat he, bataane ke liye ve kitne hai profile maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki kisi par ishaara kiya ja rahaa he, wo ham bilkul nahin kar rahe magar isi ek kaaran se yah bhi lagata he ki jaj loya kii maut se jude sawaalon ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie taaki kisi ko shaq na ho
 After all, his sister will have to tell what happened to her questions
 jaj loya nagpur nahin janaa chaahate the
 a judge's daughter was to go to the wedding there, but two judges say that she should walk
 unke kehane par ve nagpur jate hai
 After returning from marriage, he talks to his wife in Mumbai and after that his family does not know anything
 subah ek phone aata he ki jaj loya mar gaye hai
 Now you will go to Sihar after reading and listening to the question and incident written by Niranjan Takle referring to the doctor sister of Judge Loya
 kisi kii maut dil kaa daura padane se ho sakati he magar ek jaj kii maut hogi uske postmortem se lekar laash ko patni or bete ke ghar bhejne kii jagah baap ke paas gaanv bhejne kaa faisla koi or kar legaa, yah sab sawaal itani aasaani se hajam nahin hote hai
 a judge has a protocol for trivia
 unki bahan ne jo baat bataai he unke anusaar parivaar kaa faisla nahin tha ki nagpur se loya kii laash mumbai jaaegi yaa unke gaanv
 Just family members get a call that their corpse is being sent to Gategaon in Latur
 getgaanv main loya ke pita rahete hai, loya kii teen bahanen dhule, jalgaanv or aurangabad main rahati hai
 After asking whom, Justice Loya's body is sent to Gategaon instead of Mumbai
 yahi nahin laash ke saath koi suraksha nahin thi, koi police vaala nahin tha, koi protocol nahin tha
 The driver of the ambulance descends the corpse alone to Gategaon
 jin do jajon ke saath jaj loya gaye the, ve dedh maheene tak parivaar se sampark nahin karte hai
 Those judges also do not come to Gategaon with the corpse of their colleague
 yah video hamen kairavaan patrika ne di he
 In Marathi, Judge Loya's sister Anuradha Biyani is speaking with whom Loya used to talk a lot, asking medicines for trivial matters
 isliye bahan ko pataa tha ki bhai ko kis tarah kii takalif he
 Doctor sister does not agree with the reasons given for the heart attack in the post mortem report
 un kaarnon kaa unke parivaar main koi history nahin he
 The sister has a habit of writing a diary
 ve har din kii baatcheet likhti rahati thim
 That conversation revealed that he allegedly received information from RSS activist Ishwar Baheti
 kairavaan patrika ke reporter ne ishwar baheti se sawaal kiya he magar jawaab nahin aayaa he
 This is the sister who brings Justice Loya's phone to Anuradha Bayani's house a few days later
 anuraadhaa ke man main sawaal daudane lagata he ki jaj kaa phone ek ishwar baheti ko kaise mila
 If the judge dies, then his belongings will be seized and the police will be brought by law
 yahi nahin anuraadhaa kii ek or bahan sarita mandhane ke paas kisi jaj kaa phone aata he
 Sarita was in Latur that day
 bhai kii maut kii khabar milte hi latur ke ek astpal main bhartee apane bhattije ko lene jaati hai
 But there is the same God who flirts with Anuradha's house
 sarita ne dhyaan to nahin diya magar yah sawaal dhans gaya ki ye ishwar baheti koun he jo bhai kii maut kii khabar lekar aata he
 Baheti tells them that there is no need to go to Nagpur
 vahaan se laash ambulance ke zarie getgaanv bheji ja chuki he
 Baheti takes them home
 bahanon ko bahut baat main dhyaan aata he ek jaj kii maut hui he, na police na prashasan
 How does an RSS person know all this much
 jab loya kaa antim sanskaar hota he tab kai jaj shaamil hote hai
 There some judges refuse the wife and son to talk to anyone
 donon ajtak bolne kii himmat nahin juta paae, main samaj saktaa hum, aapako bhi samajhnaa chahie
 All that is needed is to live like that so much to be scared
 dilli main haratosh bal, apurvanand, shabnam hashmi, manisha sethi or saidaa hamid ne press conference kii or puri baat bataai
 Media cameras and reporters are present here, hopefully you will get to read about this news in the newspapers of 23 November
 mumkin he ki media hindu muslim kaa koi neshnal silebus lekar itnaa hangaamaa karegaa ki ye khabar dab jaaegi jaise kisi jaj kii maut kii khabar teen saal tak dabi rahati he
 This is also the fact that when everybody is hesitating to speak on this story, three to four people are holding a press conference and a reporter comes to Niranjan Takle too
 hamaare sahyogi umashankar singh is press conference ko cover karne gaye the
 The question about death is, of course, what is the problem with someone being investigated, why are there so much fear in speaking, are we beginning to embrace fear, it is not good for anyone
 dar baantnaa band kiijie, kisi par shaq bhi karnaa band kiijie lekin jab koi sawaal kar de to sarkaar or adaalat kaa kaam he ki jawaab kaa aashwaasan de or jawaab bhi de
 Based on the talk of sister Anuradha Biyani and based on her investigation, the details that Niranjan Takle has collected related to the night of death are frightening
 jaj loya nagpur ke viipi guestaouse ravi bhawan main tehre the
 Where many judges, many big officials were also staying at that time
 jab seene main dard kii shikaayat hoti he to unhen auto se le jaaya jaataa he
 Was there not a single car in that guest house, how was it taken by auto rickshaw
 ravi bhawan se do kimi kii duuri par auto rickshaw stand hai
 Loya is taken to a hospital where the ECG machine was not working
 vahaan se unhen duusare aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he
 Where he is declared dead
 yah bhi pataa nahin chal paaya he ki justise loya ko aspataal lekar koun gaya
 Who took a judge from the VIP guest house with him in an auto
 jab maut hui thi tab media main khabar chhapi thi, dil kaa daura padane se maut kii khabar ko sabane saamaanya taur par liya
 No one was suspicious
 magar anuraadhaa biani or niranjan taakale apni padtaal se kuch aise sawaal nikaalte hai jo pehali nazar main dekhne par vaaki pathar se bhi zyaada thos lagate hai
 Every page of the post-mortem is signed by a person
 dastakhat ke neeche likhaa he ki yah loya kaa chachera bhai he
 Anuradha Biyani says that she has no cousin
 record ke anusaar loya kaa shav ise saunpa jaataa he
 But only the driver had gone with the corpse in the ambulance
 vah aadmi koun tha or kahaan he is vakt jiskaa dastakhat he
 The comments report bahut lambii he or daraavnee he
 If the questions related to the death of a judge can remain incomplete, then under which system are we living? kairavaan ne ek or report chhaapi he, is report ke baad
 In which it is told that a judge was allegedly offered a bribe of hundred crores to settle this case
 iskaa zikr yahaan nahin kyonki jaj kii maut se jude sawaal abhi khatm nahin hue hai
 You must have understood why there is a snowflake in Delhi
 kya ek jaj kii maut kii jaanch se lekar postermart report tak main itane antar ho sakate hai, sunanda pushkar kii postmortem report to rose tivi par khulti he, khulani bhi chahie magar justise loya ke parivaar waalon ko kya jawaab milegaa
 Two sources from Nagpur's Sitavadi Police Station and Government Medical College told Niranjan Takle that he had seen the body at midnight, his post-mortem was also done at the same time
 magar postmortem report main mrityu kii soochna kaa vakt sava chah baje he
 The post mortem starts at 10:55 am and ends at 1155
 jaahir maut kaa samay or postmart ke samay ko lekar do tarah kii raay he
 Should this report simply be ignored, in whose interest it is to ignore these questions, a judge dies, his son and wife are unable to muster the courage to speak if the Chief Justice of India does not trust him Should be given, they should not be encouraged to speak
 aakhir jab ek naagarik dar ke kaaran jeene kaa, bolne kaa hausala chhod degaa to koun hausala degaa
 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases
 bahut mushkil he kahana ki kisi kii hatya kaa sambandh kis maamle se the magar kya yah jaananaa zaruri nahin ki ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, uske jawaab kab or kaise milenge
 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone
 main bhi aapse ek baat kahana chahta hum
 i was also scared but did it so that Anuradha Biyani did not feel that her brother was killed by anyone and there was no one to speak
 loya ke bete ko ye na lage ki is desh main koi kisi ke liye bolta nahin he
 It's not like this
 mujhe ummid he koi bole na bole, pradhanmantri or bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish zarur bolenge ki darane kii baat nahin he
 Questions that will be investigated
 patrkaar is report ko chhodkar baaki sari report dhuandhar tareeke se twit kar rahe hai taaki barf kii is silli par jitani jaldi ho sake, dhul jam jaae
 Very rarely, a reporter named Niranjan Takle has published this report by removing a layer of dust on the corpse of a judge, very easily it wants to suppress that report under the Delhi snowball
 magar yah report dhire-dhire whats ap ke tahkhaanon main bina bataae ek jagah se duusari jagah pahunch rahi he
 After reading this long report published in English, the reader starts feeling himself falling into such a dark well of fear, where even his scream does not reach him

 The fear of power disarms everyone
 kya vaaki ek sibiai ke jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon se kahani main itane chhed ho jate hai ki aapako us chhed ke us paar koi hatyara thahaake laga rahaa hota he, uski hansi pahachaani lagati he magar naam jubaan par nahin aata he
 The impact of this report is like a mysterious thriller which should be taught in a journalism course
 jo bhi paanch lakh fees dekar patrakarita pard rahe hai unhen is par project karnaa chahie
 Sometimes it is also due to legitimate reasons that others wait before putting their hand to the story of the institute
 yah puri tarah se thik bhi he magar hairaani kii baat ye he ki do dinon tak chhapane ke baad bhi adaalaton ke galiyaaron se koi awaz sunai nahin di
 It is possible that no one has read
 jajon ke paas vakt kahaan hota he, agar padhi hoti to unhen kya karnaa chahie tha, kya ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kii file dobaaraa nahin khul sakati he
 Shouldn't the court have given this assurance to the law minister, to the acting guardian of the country, the Prime Minister
 kya vipaksh ko sawaal nahin karnaa chahie tha
 Shouldn't everyone give an assurance that we will investigate this or else the people inside the judiciary will lose their trust, otherwise people outside the judiciary will not have confidence in the people sitting inside
 patni apane pati or betaa apane pita kii maut par khamosh ho gaye
 Their fear may have been reasonable, but Justice Loya's doctor sister dared to say it after three years
 lekin jab ek bahan ne baat kah di, ek reporter ne report chhap di, ek patrika ne use logon tak pahunchaa diya to phir dilli main patrakaron or nyaay jagat ke logon kii jubaan par barf kii silli kyon jam gai he
 Story is scary
 maine is story ko padhane vaale patrakaron ko darate dekha he
 i was shocked to find out whether the death of a judge was really death or that someone was murdered
 nagpur main 1 disambar 2014 kii subah jaj brijagopal loya kii maut dil kaa daura padane se bataai jaati he
 Three years later, her sister's questions pierce her bones, she seems to have been murdered by someone and the killer is comfortably watching TV
 usne kairavaan kii story chupake se padhi to hogi
 It is possible that to cover this story, a storm of hindu-muslim issues may arise in Delhi, there may be issues where there is a war between Maulana and anchors on TV, but whenever the storm stops, the story starts to shine
 patrakarita kaa ek daayitv yah bhi he jab saare log kisi story ko mara hua chhod kar chale jaaen to bahut dinon baad vahaan lautaa jaae or dekha jaae ki vahaan kuch or suraag to nahin tha

 Justice Loya dies in Nagpur on the morning of 1 December 2014
 15 disambar 2014 ko jaj loya ke saamne amit shah kii peshi honi thi
 On 30 December, new judge MG Gosavi acquits Amit Shah from all charges
 faisle main kaha jaataa he ki raajnneetik kaarnon se amit shah ko fansaaya gaya tha
 The reference to Amit Shah in the judge's death story is just a matter of context, to tell how many high profile cases he was hearing, it does not mean that anyone is being pointed out, we are not doing that at all, but For the same reason, it seems that the questions related to the death of Judge Loya should be taken seriously so that no one becomes suspicious
 aakhir unki bahan ko bataanaa to padegaa ki unke sawaalon kaa kya hua
 Judge Loya did not want to go to Nagpur
 vahaan ek jaj kii beti kii shaadi main janaa tha magar do jaj kehete hai ki chalanaa chahie
 They go to Nagpur at his behest
 shaadi se laut kar mumbai main apni patni se baat karte hai or uske baad unke parivaar ko kuch pataa nahin chalata
 a call comes in the morning that Judge Loya has died
 niranjan taakale ne jaj loya kii doctor bahan ke hawaale se jo sawaal or ghatana likhaa he ab aap use padhakar or sunakar sihar jaaenge
 Someone can die of a heart attack, but a judge will die
 From his post-mortem to someone else, the decision to send the corpse to the village near the father instead of sending it to the wife and son's house, will make the question so easy Are not
 ek jaj kaa maamuli baton ke liye protocol hota he
 According to what his sister has told, the family did not decide whether Loya's corpse would go to Mumbai or his village from Nagpur
 bas parivaar ke sadasyon ko phone aata he ki unki laash latur ke getgaanv bheji ja rahi he
 Loya's father lives in Getgaon, Loya's three sisters live in Dhule, Jalgaon and Aurangabad
 akhir kisase puch kar justise loya kii laash mumbai kii jagah getgaanv bheji jaati he
 Not only this, there was no protection with the corpse, there was no police, no protocol
 ebulence kaa dryver akele us laash ko getgaanv lekar utarataa he
 The two judges with whom the judge was taken do not contact the family for a month and a half
 ve jaj bhi apane sahyogi kii laash ke saath getgaanv nahin aate hai
 This video was given to us by Caravan magazine
 marathi main jaj loya kii bahan anuraadhaa biani bol rahi hai jinase loya kaaphi baat karte the, maamuli baton ke liye dawa poochhate the
 So the sister knew what kind of problem the brother had
 postmortem report main dil kaa daura padane ke jo kaaran bataae gaye hai, usase doctor bahan sahamat nahin hai
 Those reasons have no history in his family
 bahan kii aadat he diary likhane kii
 She kept writing every day's conversation
 us baatcheet se pataa chalaa ki unhen maut kii soochna kathith taur par aresas ke kaaryakarta ishwar baheti se milti he
 The reporter of Caravan magazine has questioned Ishwar Baheti but the answer has not come
 yahi baheti he jo kuch dinon baad anuraadhaa bayani ke ghar justise loya kaa phone lekar aata he
 Anuradha's question begins to run in the mind how the judge's phone was received by a god Baheti
 jaj kii maut hogi, to unke saamaanon kii zabti hogi or kaayade se police hi lekar aegi
 Not only this, another judge of Anuradha's sister Sarita Mandhane gets a call from a judge
 sarita us din latur main thi
 As soon as the news of his brother's death is received, he goes to pick up his nephew, who is admitted in a hospital in Latur
 lekin vahaan vahi ishwar baheti miltaa he jo phone lekar anuraadhaa ke ghar gaya tha
 Sarita did not pay attention, but the question was settled as to who is this God who flows and brings news of his brother's death
 baheti unhen kahata he ki nagpur jane kii zarurat nahin he
 From there, the body has been sent to Gategaon via ambulance
 baheti unhen ghar lekar jaataa he
 The sisters get a lot of attention from the fact that one judge has died, neither the police nor the administration
 aresas kaa ek aadmi itnaa sab kuch kaise jaanata he
 Many judges are involved when Loya is cremated
 vahaan kuch jaj patni or bete ko kisi se baat karne se manaa karte hai
 Both of them could not muster the courage to speak till today, i can understand, you should also understand
 bas itnaa hi kahana he ki aisa bhi kya jeena ki itnaa darana chahie
 In Delhi, Hartosh Bal, Apoorvanand, Shabnam Hashmi, Manisha Sethi and Syeda Hameed held a press conference and explained the whole thing
 yahaan media ke camere or reporter to maujuud nazar aa rahe hai, ummid he aapako 23 november ke akhbaaron main is khabar ke bare main padhane ko milegaa
 It is possible that the media will create such a ruckus by taking a national syllabus of Hindu Muslim that this news will be suppressed as if the news of the death of a judge is buried for three years
 yahi khubi bhi he ki jab sab log is story par bolne se kataraa rahe hai teen chaar log press conference kar rahe hai or ek reporter niranjan taakale bhi aata he to yah story kar detaa he
 Our colleague Umashankar Singh went to cover this press conference
 maut ko lekar sawaal hi to he, zaahir he jaanch hone main kisi ko kya dikkat he, bolne main itnaa dar kyon hai, kya ham dar ko gale lagane lage hai, yah kisi ke liye acha nahin he
 Stop sharing fear, stop doubting anyone, but when someone asks a question, it is the job of the government and the court to give assurance and answer
 bahan anuraadhaa biani kii baton or apni jaanch ke aadhaar par niranjan taakale ne maut kii raat se jude jo detail jutaaye hai, wo daraane vaale hai
 Judge Loya stayed at Nagpur's VIP guesthouse Ravi Bhavan
 jahaan us vakt kai jaj, kai bade adhikari bhi tehre the
 They are taken by auto when there are complaints of chest pain
 kya us guest house main ek bhi gaadi nahin thi, auto rickshaw se kaise le jaaya gaya
 There are auto rickshaw stands two km from Ravi Bhavan
 loya ko ek aise aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he jahaan isiji mashin kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 From there he is taken to another hospital
 jahaan unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 It is also not known who took Justice Loya to the hospital
 viipi guest house se ek jaj ko auto main bithakar koun le gaya tha
 When the death took place, there was a news in the media, everyone took the news of the death due to a heart attack
 kisi ko shaq bhi nahin hua
 But Anuradha Biyani and Niranjan Takle draw out some questions from their investigations that at first glance look really more concrete than stone
 postmortem ke har panne par ek vyakti ke dastakhat he
 It is written under the sign that it is Loya's cousin
 anuraadhaa biani kahati hai ki unka koi chachera bhai nahin he
 According to the records, the body of Loya is assigned to it
 magar ambulance main laash lekar to sirf driver gaya tha
 Who was the man and where is he signed at the moment
 tippaniyan The report is very long and scary
 agar ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaal adhure rah sakate hai to ham kis vyavastha main ji rahe hai
 Caravan has published another report, following this report
 jisamen bataaya he ki ek jaj ko is cese ko nipataane ke liye sau karod ke rishwat kii kathith rup se peshkash hui thi
 It is not mentioned here because the questions related to the death of the judge are not over yet
 aap samaj gaye honge ki kyon dilli par barf kii silli padi he
 Can there be so much difference between the investigation of a judge's death and the post-mortem report, Sunanda Pushkar's post-mortem report opens on TV every day, it should also be opened but what answer will be given to the family of Justice Loya
 nagpur ke sitavdi police stesan or sarkari medical college ke do sutron ne niranjan taakale ko bataaya ki unhone aadhi raat ko hi shav dekh liya tha, uskaa postmortem bhi usee vakt kar liya gaya tha
 But in the post-mortem report, the time of the notice of death is six and a quarter
 postmortem shuru hota he 10 bajkar 55 minute par or khatm hota he 11 bajkar 55 minute par
 There are obviously two types of opinion about the time of death and the time of postmart
 kya is report ko yun hi andekha kar diya janaa chahie, kiske hit main in sawaalon ko andekha karnaa, ek jaj kii maut hoti he, unka betaa or patni bolne kaa saahas nahin juta pate to kya bharat ke pramukh nyaayadhish ko unhen suraksha kaa bharosa nahin dena chahie, unhen bolne kaa hausala nahin dena chahie
 After all, when a citizen will give up the courage to live, to speak because of fear, then who will give encouragement
 kya satta ko hamane dar kaa chadar bana liya he ki wo daraati rahegi or ham us dar kii chadar ko taan kar sote rahenge, uske neeche dar se kaanpate rahenge, sawaal simpal he, jaj tamaam tarah ke maamalon kii sunwaayee karte hai
 It is very difficult to say what was the matter related to the murder of someone, but it is not necessary to know that questions are being raised about the death of a judge, when and how to get his answers
 agar is story ke sandarbh se kisi ko dar he to kya bina sandarbh ke parvaah kiye sirf jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab nahi khoja saktaa he
 The answer is also important for a common citizen
 varanaa sabko lagegaa ki jab ek jaj ke saath aisa ho saktaa he to phir kisi ke saath ho saktaa he
 i also want to tell you one thing
 mujhe bhi dar laga tha, lekin isliye ise kiya taaki anuraadhaa biani ko ye na lage ki uske bhai ko kisi ne maar diya or bolne vaala koi nahin tha
 Loya's son does not feel that in this country no one speaks for anyone
 aisa nahin he
 i hope no one says, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India will surely say that there is nothing to fear
 jo sawaal hai unki jaanch hogi
 The impact of this report is like a mysterious thriller which should be taught in a journalism course
 jo bhi paanch lakh fees dekar patrakarita pard rahe hai unhen is par project karnaa chahie
 Sometimes it is also due to legitimate reasons that others wait before putting their hand to the story of the institute
 yah puri tarah se thik bhi he magar hairaani kii baat ye he ki do dinon tak chhapane ke baad bhi adaalaton ke galiyaaron se koi awaz sunai nahin di

 aisa nahin he
 i hope no one says, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India will surely say that there is nothing to fear
 jo sawaal hai unki jaanch hogi
 Where should the judges have time, if they had studied, what should they have done, can the file of questions related to the death of a judge not open again
 adaalat ko, kanoon mantri ko, desh ke kaaryakari sangrakshak pradhanmantri ko kya yah aashwaasan apni taraf se nahin dena chahie tha
 Shouldn't the opposition have questioned
 kya sabko yah aashwaasan nahin dena chahie ki ham is kii jaanch karenge varanaa nyaaypalika ke bheetar ke logon kaa apane kaam se bharosa uth jayega, varna nyaaypalika ke baahar ke logon kaa bheetar baithe logon par bharosa nahin rahegaa
 The wife became silent on the death of her husband and son
 unka dar vaazib hi rahaa hoga, magar justise loya kii doctor bahan ne teen saal baad kehane kii himmat juta lee
 But when a sister spoke, a reporter printed the report, a magazine gave it to the people, then why is the snow capped on the tongue of journalists and people of justice in Delhi
 story daraavnee to he
 i have seen journalists reading this story in awe
 main khud sihar gaya ki kya ek jaj kii maut vaaki maut thi yaa kisi ne hatya kar di
 On the morning of 1 December 2014 in Nagpur, Judge Brijgopal Loya is reported to have died of a heart attack
 teen saal baad unki bahan ke sawaal haddiyon main chhed kar dete hai, lagata he ki unki kisi ne hatya kar di or hatyara aaraam se tivi dekh rahaa he
 He must have read the caravan story secretly
 mumkin he is story par pardaa daalane ke liye dilli main hindu muslim muddon kii aandhi chal jaae, aise masale aa jaaen jahaan tivi par moulana or ankaron ke bich jang chhid jaae lekin jab bhi aandhi thamati he wo story jhalkane lagati he
 It is also an obligation of journalism when all the people leave a story dead and then return to it after a long time and see if there was any more clue
 aap niranjan taakale kii is story ko caravanmagazine
 can read on com
 angrezi main he or lambii bhi he
 Scroll it after the caravan
 in or the wire
 in has also printed hindi main aap the wirehindi
 com, mediavigil

 in has also added a new angle to this story
 kannada akhbaar vaartabharati or malayalam main chhapane vaala akhbaar madhyamum ne is report ko cover kiya he
 Dew are in the offices of newspapers in Delhi
 kairavaan kii is story kii jaanch hamane apane str par nahin kii magar jab sibiai ke jaj brijagopal loya kii bahan kaa video bayaan dekha to laga ki kam se kam jaisi story he use us rup main bataaya ja saktaa he
 CBI Special Court Judge Brijgopal Loya was hearing the Sohrabuddin encounter case in which BJP national president Amit Shah was the main accused
 30 disambar 2014 ko sibiai ke special sibiai jaj embi gosaavi amit shah ko is aarope se bari kar dete hai
 The CBI did not appeal against this decision in the Upper Court
 apil karne kaa iraadaa he bhi yaa nahin, koun poochhega
 When people get scared of a printed story, who will ask why the appeal is not being made
 6 june 2014 ko special jaj utpat naaraazgi zaahir karte hai ki amit shah kyon nahin aae
 The judge orders that Amit Shah should appear in court on June 20, not come
 jaj utpat agali sunwaayee kii tarikh 26 june tay karte hai magar 25 june ko unka tabadalaa ho jaataa he
 The Supreme Court has ordered that the same officer in the Sohrabuddin case will remain in the investigation and hearing from beginning to end
 jaj utpat kaa tabadalaa pune ho jaataa he
 In his place comes 48 years Judge Brijgopal Harikshan Loya
 jaj loya amit shah ko nijee taur par haazir hone kii shart se chhot de dete hai
 It is said that they wanted to revisit the charge sheet of ten thousand pages, new judges were so and case sensitive as well
 unke saath rahane vaali bhanji nupur ne bataaya he ki is cese ko lekar bahut tanaav he
 There are many people involved in how to understand it
 isse kaise nipta jaae
 Bhanji told this to Niranjan Takle, a reporter for Caravan
 usee ke baad se niranjan ne is kahani kii padtaal shuru kar di
 On October 31, Judge Loya asked why Amit Shah is not present
 shah ke vakil kehete hai ki unhone khud haazir naa hone kii chhot di he
 Loya reminds that the exemption was when Shah was outside the state, on that day Shah was in Mumbai
 1 disambar 2014 kii subah nagpur main justise loya kii maut hoti he
 On December 15, 2014, Amit Shah was to appear before Judge Loya
 30 disambar ko nae jaj emji gosaavi amit shah ko sabhi aaropon se bari kar dete hai
 The verdict states that Amit Shah was implicated for political reasons
 jaj kii maut vaali story main amit shah kaa zikr sirf sandarbh kii baat he, bataane ke liye ve kitne hai profile maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki kisi par ishaara kiya ja rahaa he, wo ham bilkul nahin kar rahe magar isi ek kaaran se yah bhi lagata he ki jaj loya kii maut se jude sawaalon ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie taaki kisi ko shaq na ho
 After all, his sister will have to tell what happened to her questions
 jaj loya nagpur nahin janaa chaahate the
 a judge's daughter was to go to the wedding there, but two judges say that she should walk
 unke kehane par ve nagpur jate hai
 After returning from marriage, he talks to his wife in Mumbai and after that his family does not know anything
 subah ek phone aata he ki jaj loya mar gaye hai
 Now you will go to Sihar after reading and listening to the question and incident written by Niranjan Takle referring to the doctor sister of Judge Loya
 kisi kii maut dil kaa daura padane se ho sakati he magar ek jaj kii maut hogi uske postmortem se lekar laash ko patni or bete ke ghar bhejne kii jagah baap ke paas gaanv bhejne kaa faisla koi or kar legaa, yah sab sawaal itani aasaani se hajam nahin hote hai
 a judge has a protocol for trivia
 unki bahan ne jo baat bataai he unke anusaar parivaar kaa faisla nahin tha ki nagpur se loya kii laash mumbai jaaegi yaa unke gaanv
 Just family members get a call that their corpse is being sent to Gategaon in Latur
 getgaanv main loya ke pita rahete hai, loya kii teen bahanen dhule, jalgaanv or aurangabad main rahati hai
 After asking whom, Justice Loya's body is sent to Gategaon instead of Mumbai
 yahi nahin laash ke saath koi suraksha nahin thi, koi police vaala nahin tha, koi protocol nahin tha
 The driver of the ambulance descends the corpse alone to Gategaon
 jin do jajon ke saath jaj loya gaye the, ve dedh maheene tak parivaar se sampark nahin karte hai
 Those judges also do not come to Gategaon with the corpse of their colleague
 yah video hamen kairavaan patrika ne di he
 In Marathi, Judge Loya's sister Anuradha Biyani is speaking with whom Loya used to talk a lot, asking medicines for trivial matters
 isliye bahan ko pataa tha ki bhai ko kis tarah kii takalif he
 Doctor sister does not agree with the reasons given for the heart attack in the post mortem report
 un kaarnon kaa unke parivaar main koi history nahin he
 The sister has a habit of writing a diary
 ve har din kii baatcheet likhti rahati thim
 That conversation revealed that he allegedly received information from RSS activist Ishwar Baheti
 kairavaan patrika ke reporter ne ishwar baheti se sawaal kiya he magar jawaab nahin aayaa he
 This is the sister who brings Justice Loya's phone to Anuradha Bayani's house a few days later
 anuraadhaa ke man main sawaal daudane lagata he ki jaj kaa phone ek ishwar baheti ko kaise mila
 If the judge dies, then his belongings will be seized and the police will be brought by law
 yahi nahin anuraadhaa kii ek or bahan sarita mandhane ke paas kisi jaj kaa phone aata he
 Sarita was in Latur that day
 bhai kii maut kii khabar milte hi latur ke ek astpal main bhartee apane bhattije ko lene jaati hai
 But there is the same God who flirts with Anuradha's house
 sarita ne dhyaan to nahin diya magar yah sawaal dhans gaya ki ye ishwar baheti koun he jo bhai kii maut kii khabar lekar aata he
 Baheti tells them that there is no need to go to Nagpur
 vahaan se laash ambulance ke zarie getgaanv bheji ja chuki he
 Baheti takes them home
 bahanon ko bahut baat main dhyaan aata he ek jaj kii maut hui he, na police na prashasan
 How does an RSS person know all this much
 jab loya kaa antim sanskaar hota he tab kai jaj shaamil hote hai
 There some judges refuse the wife and son to talk to anyone
 donon ajtak bolne kii himmat nahin juta paae, main samaj saktaa hum, aapako bhi samajhnaa chahie
 All that is needed is to live like that so much to be scared
 dilli main haratosh bal, apurvanand, shabnam hashmi, manisha sethi or saidaa hamid ne press conference kii or puri baat bataai
 Media cameras and reporters are present here, hopefully you will get to read about this news in the newspapers of 23 November
 mumkin he ki media hindu muslim kaa koi neshnal silebus lekar itnaa hangaamaa karegaa ki ye khabar dab jaaegi jaise kisi jaj kii maut kii khabar teen saal tak dabi rahati he
 This is also the fact that when everybody is hesitating to speak on this story, three to four people are holding a press conference and a reporter comes to Niranjan Takle too
 hamaare sahyogi umashankar singh is press conference ko cover karne gaye the
 The question about death is, of course, what is the problem with someone being investigated, why are there so much fear in speaking, are we beginning to embrace fear, it is not good for anyone
 dar baantnaa band kiijie, kisi par shaq bhi karnaa band kiijie lekin jab koi sawaal kar de to sarkaar or adaalat kaa kaam he ki jawaab kaa aashwaasan de or jawaab bhi de
 Based on the talk of sister Anuradha Biyani and based on her investigation, the details that Niranjan Takle has collected related to the night of death are frightening
 jaj loya nagpur ke viipi guestaouse ravi bhawan main tehre the
 Where many judges, many big officials were also staying at that time
 jab seene main dard kii shikaayat hoti he to unhen auto se le jaaya jaataa he
 Was there not a single car in that guest house, how was it taken by auto rickshaw
 ravi bhawan se do kimi kii duuri par auto rickshaw stand hai
 Loya is taken to a hospital where the ECG machine was not working
 vahaan se unhen duusare aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he
 Where he is declared dead
 yah bhi pataa nahin chal paaya he ki justise loya ko aspataal lekar koun gaya
 Who took a judge from the VIP guest house with him in an auto
 jab maut hui thi tab media main khabar chhapi thi, dil kaa daura padane se maut kii khabar ko sabane saamaanya taur par liya
 No one was suspicious
 magar anuraadhaa biani or niranjan taakale apni padtaal se kuch aise sawaal nikaalte hai jo pehali nazar main dekhne par vaaki pathar se bhi zyaada thos lagate hai
 Every page of the post-mortem is signed by a person
 dastakhat ke neeche likhaa he ki yah loya kaa chachera bhai he
 Anuradha Biyani says that she has no cousin
 record ke anusaar loya kaa shav ise saunpa jaataa he
 But only the driver had gone with the corpse in the ambulance
 vah aadmi koun tha or kahaan he is vakt jiskaa dastakhat he
 The comments report bahut lambii he or daraavnee he
 If the questions related to the death of a judge can remain incomplete, then under which system are we living? kairavaan ne ek or report chhaapi he, is report ke baad
 In which it is told that a judge was allegedly offered a bribe of hundred crores to settle this case
 iskaa zikr yahaan nahin kyonki jaj kii maut se jude sawaal abhi khatm nahin hue hai
 You must have understood why there is a snowflake in Delhi
 kya ek jaj kii maut kii jaanch se lekar postermart report tak main itane antar ho sakate hai, sunanda pushkar kii postmortem report to rose tivi par khulti he, khulani bhi chahie magar justise loya ke parivaar waalon ko kya jawaab milegaa
 Two sources from Nagpur's Sitavadi Police Station and Government Medical College told Niranjan Takle that he had seen the body at midnight, his post-mortem was also done at the same time
 magar postmortem report main mrityu kii soochna kaa vakt sava chah baje he
 The post mortem starts at 10:55 am and ends at 1155
 jaahir maut kaa samay or postmart ke samay ko lekar do tarah kii raay he
 Should this report simply be ignored, in whose interest it is to ignore these questions, a judge dies, his son and wife are unable to muster the courage to speak if the Chief Justice of India does not trust him Should be given, they should not be encouraged to speak
 aakhir jab ek naagarik dar ke kaaran jeene kaa, bolne kaa hausala chhod degaa to koun hausala degaa
 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases
 bahut mushkil he kahana ki kisi kii hatya kaa sambandh kis maamle se the magar kya yah jaananaa zaruri nahin ki ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, uske jawaab kab or kaise milenge
 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone
 main bhi aapse ek baat kahana chahta hum
 i was also scared but did it so that Anuradha Biyani did not feel that her brother was killed by anyone and there was no one to speak
 loya ke bete ko ye na lage ki is desh main koi kisi ke liye bolta nahin he
 It's not like this
 mujhe ummid he koi bole na bole, pradhanmantri or bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish zarur bolenge ki darane kii baat nahin he
 Questions that will be investigated
 patni apane pati or betaa apane pita kii maut par khamosh ho gaye
 Their fear may have been reasonable, but Justice Loya's doctor sister dared to say it after three years
 lekin jab ek bahan ne baat kah di, ek reporter ne report chhap di, ek patrika ne use logon tak pahunchaa diya to phir dilli main patrakaron or nyaay jagat ke logon kii jubaan par barf kii silli kyon jam gai he
 Story is scary
 maine is story ko padhane vaale patrakaron ko darate dekha he
 i was shocked to find out whether the death of a judge was really death or that someone was murdered
 nagpur main 1 disambar 2014 kii subah jaj brijagopal loya kii maut dil kaa daura padane se bataai jaati he
 Three years later, her sister's questions pierce her bones, she seems to have been murdered by someone and the killer is comfortably watching TV
 usne kairavaan kii story chupake se padhi to hogi
 It is possible that to cover this story, a storm of hindu-muslim issues may arise in Delhi, there may be issues where there is a war between Maulana and anchors on TV, but whenever the storm stops, the story starts to shine
 patrakarita kaa ek daayitv yah bhi he jab saare log kisi story ko mara hua chhod kar chale jaaen to bahut dinon baad vahaan lautaa jaae or dekha jaae ki vahaan kuch or suraag to nahin tha
 You caravanmagazine this story of Niranjan Takle
 com par pard sakate hai
 Is in English and also long
 kairavaan ke baad ise scroll

 Kannada newspaper Varta Bharati and Madhyam, a newspaper published in Malayalam, have covered this report
 dilli ke akhbaaron ke daftar main os pad gaye hai
 We did not investigate this story of Caravan at our level, but when we saw the video statement of CBI Judge Brijgopal Loya's sister, it seemed that at least the story as it is can be told
 sibiai ke special court ke jaj brijagopal loya soharabuddin encounter maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, jis maamle main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah mukhya aaropee the
 On 30 December 2014, CBI Special CBI Judge MB Gosavi acquits Amit Shah of this charge
 sibiai ne is faisle ke kilaaf upree adaalat main apil nahin kii
 Whether it is intended to appeal or not, who will ask
 jab log ek chhapi hui story se dar jate he vahaan koun poochhega ki apil kyon nahin kii ja rahi he
 On June 6, 2014, Special Judge Uptap resentment reveals why Amit Shah did not come
 jaj utpat aadesh dete hai ki amit shah 20 june ko court main haazir hon, nahin aate hai
 Judge Utpat fixes the date of next hearing on June 26 but he is transferred on June 25
 supreme court kaa aadesh he ki soharabuddin maamle main ek hi adhikari shuru se ant tak jaanch or sunwaayee main rahegaa
 Judge Utpat is transferred to Pune
 unki jagah aate hai 48 saal jaj brijagopal harikishan loya
 Judge Loya exempts Amit Shah from the condition of appearing in private
 kehete hai ki ve das hazaar pej kii chargeshit ko phir se dekhnaa chaahate the, nae jaj the isliye or cese samvedansheel tha isliye bhi
 The niece Nupur, who lives with her, has told that there is a lot of tension about this case
 ise kaise samajha jaae, isamen bahut log shaamil hai
 How to deal with it
 bhanji ne yah baat kairavaan ke reporter niranjan taakale ko bataai
 From then onwards Niranjan started investigating this story
 31 aktubar ko jaj loya ne poocha ki amit shah haazir kyon nahin hai
 Shah's lawyer says he has given himself up to not be present
 loya yaad dilaate hai ki chhot tab tha jab shah rajya ke baahar hon, us din shah mumbai main the
 Justice Loya dies in Nagpur on the morning of 1 December 2014
 15 disambar 2014 ko jaj loya ke saamne amit shah kii peshi honi thi
 On 30 December, new judge MG Gosavi acquits Amit Shah from all charges
 faisle main kaha jaataa he ki raajnneetik kaarnon se amit shah ko fansaaya gaya tha
 The reference to Amit Shah in the judge's death story is just a matter of context, to tell how many high profile cases he was hearing, it does not mean that anyone is being pointed out, we are not doing that at all, but For the same reason, it seems that the questions related to the death of Judge Loya should be taken seriously so that no one becomes suspicious
 aakhir unki bahan ko bataanaa to padegaa ki unke sawaalon kaa kya hua
 Judge Loya did not want to go to Nagpur
 vahaan ek jaj kii beti kii shaadi main janaa tha magar do jaj kehete hai ki chalanaa chahie
 They go to Nagpur at his behest
 shaadi se laut kar mumbai main apni patni se baat karte hai or uske baad unke parivaar ko kuch pataa nahin chalata
 a call comes in the morning that Judge Loya has died
 niranjan taakale ne jaj loya kii doctor bahan ke hawaale se jo sawaal or ghatana likhaa he ab aap use padhakar or sunakar sihar jaaenge
 Someone can die of a heart attack, but a judge will die
 From his post-mortem to someone else, the decision to send the corpse to the village near the father instead of sending it to the wife and son's house, will make the question so easy Are not
 ek jaj kaa maamuli baton ke liye protocol hota he
 According to what his sister has told, the family did not decide whether Loya's corpse would go to Mumbai or his village from Nagpur
 bas parivaar ke sadasyon ko phone aata he ki unki laash latur ke getgaanv bheji ja rahi he
 Loya's father lives in Getgaon, Loya's three sisters live in Dhule, Jalgaon and Aurangabad
 akhir kisase puch kar justise loya kii laash mumbai kii jagah getgaanv bheji jaati he
 Not only this, there was no protection with the corpse, there was no police, no protocol
 ebulence kaa dryver akele us laash ko getgaanv lekar utarataa he
 The two judges with whom the judge was taken do not contact the family for a month and a half
 ve jaj bhi apane sahyogi kii laash ke saath getgaanv nahin aate hai
 This video was given to us by Caravan magazine
 marathi main jaj loya kii bahan anuraadhaa biani bol rahi hai jinase loya kaaphi baat karte the, maamuli baton ke liye dawa poochhate the
 So the sister knew what kind of problem the brother had
 postmortem report main dil kaa daura padane ke jo kaaran bataae gaye hai, usase doctor bahan sahamat nahin hai
 Those reasons have no history in his family
 bahan kii aadat he diary likhane kii
 She kept writing every day's conversation
 us baatcheet se pataa chalaa ki unhen maut kii soochna kathith taur par aresas ke kaaryakarta ishwar baheti se milti he
 The reporter of Caravan magazine has questioned Ishwar Baheti but the answer has not come
 yahi baheti he jo kuch dinon baad anuraadhaa bayani ke ghar justise loya kaa phone lekar aata he
 Anuradha's question begins to run in the mind how the judge's phone was received by a god Baheti
 jaj kii maut hogi, to unke saamaanon kii zabti hogi or kaayade se police hi lekar aegi
 Not only this, another judge of Anuradha's sister Sarita Mandhane gets a call from a judge
 sarita us din latur main thi
 As soon as the news of his brother's death is received, he goes to pick up his nephew, who is admitted in a hospital in Latur
 lekin vahaan vahi ishwar baheti miltaa he jo phone lekar anuraadhaa ke ghar gaya tha
 Sarita did not pay attention, but the question was settled as to who is this God who flows and brings news of his brother's death
 baheti unhen kahata he ki nagpur jane kii zarurat nahin he
 From there, the body has been sent to Gategaon via ambulance
 baheti unhen ghar lekar jaataa he
 The sisters get a lot of attention from the fact that one judge has died, neither the police nor the administration
 aresas kaa ek aadmi itnaa sab kuch kaise jaanata he
 Many judges are involved when Loya is cremated
 vahaan kuch jaj patni or bete ko kisi se baat karne se manaa karte hai
 Both of them could not muster the courage to speak till today, i can understand, you should also understand
 bas itnaa hi kahana he ki aisa bhi kya jeena ki itnaa darana chahie
 In Delhi, Hartosh Bal, Apoorvanand, Shabnam Hashmi, Manisha Sethi and Syeda Hameed held a press conference and explained the whole thing
 yahaan media ke camere or reporter to maujuud nazar aa rahe hai, ummid he aapako 23 november ke akhbaaron main is khabar ke bare main padhane ko milegaa
 It is possible that the media will create such a ruckus by taking a national syllabus of Hindu Muslim that this news will be suppressed as if the news of the death of a judge is buried for three years
 yahi khubi bhi he ki jab sab log is story par bolne se kataraa rahe hai teen chaar log press conference kar rahe hai or ek reporter niranjan taakale bhi aata he to yah story kar detaa he
 Our colleague Umashankar Singh went to cover this press conference
 maut ko lekar sawaal hi to he, zaahir he jaanch hone main kisi ko kya dikkat he, bolne main itnaa dar kyon hai, kya ham dar ko gale lagane lage hai, yah kisi ke liye acha nahin he
 Stop sharing fear, stop doubting anyone, but when someone asks a question, it is the job of the government and the court to give assurance and answer
 bahan anuraadhaa biani kii baton or apni jaanch ke aadhaar par niranjan taakale ne maut kii raat se jude jo detail jutaaye hai, wo daraane vaale hai
 Judge Loya stayed at Nagpur's VIP guesthouse Ravi Bhavan
 jahaan us vakt kai jaj, kai bade adhikari bhi tehre the
 They are taken by auto when there are complaints of chest pain
 kya us guest house main ek bhi gaadi nahin thi, auto rickshaw se kaise le jaaya gaya
 There are auto rickshaw stands two km from Ravi Bhavan
 loya ko ek aise aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he jahaan isiji mashin kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 From there he is taken to another hospital
 jahaan unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 It is also not known who took Justice Loya to the hospital
 viipi guest house se ek jaj ko auto main bithakar koun le gaya tha
 When the death took place, there was a news in the media, everyone took the news of the death due to a heart attack
 kisi ko shaq bhi nahin hua
 But Anuradha Biyani and Niranjan Takle draw out some questions from their investigations that at first glance look really more concrete than stone
 postmortem ke har panne par ek vyakti ke dastakhat he
 It is written under the sign that it is Loya's cousin
 anuraadhaa biani kahati hai ki unka koi chachera bhai nahin he
 According to the records, the body of Loya is assigned to it
 magar ambulance main laash lekar to sirf driver gaya tha
 Who was the man and where is he signed at the moment
 tippaniyan The report is very long and scary
 agar ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaal adhure rah sakate hai to ham kis vyavastha main ji rahe hai
 Caravan has published another report, following this report
 jisamen bataaya he ki ek jaj ko is cese ko nipataane ke liye sau karod ke rishwat kii kathith rup se peshkash hui thi
 It is not mentioned here because the questions related to the death of the judge are not over yet
 aap samaj gaye honge ki kyon dilli par barf kii silli padi he
 Can there be so much difference between the investigation of a judge's death and the post-mortem report, Sunanda Pushkar's post-mortem report opens on TV every day, it should also be opened but what answer will be given to the family of Justice Loya
 nagpur ke sitavdi police stesan or sarkari medical college ke do sutron ne niranjan taakale ko bataaya ki unhone aadhi raat ko hi shav dekh liya tha, uskaa postmortem bhi usee vakt kar liya gaya tha
 But in the post-mortem report, the time of the notice of death is six and a quarter
 postmortem shuru hota he 10 bajkar 55 minute par or khatm hota he 11 bajkar 55 minute par
 There are obviously two types of opinion about the time of death and the time of postmart
 kya is report ko yun hi andekha kar diya janaa chahie, kiske hit main in sawaalon ko andekha karnaa, ek jaj kii maut hoti he, unka betaa or patni bolne kaa saahas nahin juta pate to kya bharat ke pramukh nyaayadhish ko unhen suraksha kaa bharosa nahin dena chahie, unhen bolne kaa hausala nahin dena chahie
 After all, when a citizen will give up the courage to live, to speak because of fear, then who will give encouragement
 kya satta ko hamane dar kaa chadar bana liya he ki wo daraati rahegi or ham us dar kii chadar ko taan kar sote rahenge, uske neeche dar se kaanpate rahenge, sawaal simpal he, jaj tamaam tarah ke maamalon kii sunwaayee karte hai
 It is very difficult to say what was the matter related to the murder of someone, but it is not necessary to know that questions are being raised about the death of a judge, when and how to get his answers
 agar is story ke sandarbh se kisi ko dar he to kya bina sandarbh ke parvaah kiye sirf jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab nahi khoja saktaa he
 The answer is also important for a common citizen
 varanaa sabko lagegaa ki jab ek jaj ke saath aisa ho saktaa he to phir kisi ke saath ho saktaa he
 i also want to tell you one thing
 mujhe bhi dar laga tha, lekin isliye ise kiya taaki anuraadhaa biani ko ye na lage ki uske bhai ko kisi ne maar diya or bolne vaala koi nahin tha
 Loya's son does not feel that in this country no one speaks for anyone
 aisa nahin he
 i hope no one says, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India will surely say that there is nothing to fear
 jo sawaal hai unki jaanch hogi
 On the morning of 1 December 2014 in Nagpur, Judge Brijgopal Loya is reported to have died of a heart attack
 teen saal baad unki bahan ke sawaal haddiyon main chhed kar dete hai, lagata he ki unki kisi ne hatya kar di or hatyara aaraam se tivi dekh rahaa he
 He must have read the caravan story secretly
 mumkin he is story par pardaa daalane ke liye dilli main hindu muslim muddon kii aandhi chal jaae, aise masale aa jaaen jahaan tivi par moulana or ankaron ke bich jang chhid jaae lekin jab bhi aandhi thamati he wo story jhalkane lagati he
 It is also an obligation of journalism when all the people leave a story dead and then return to it after a long time and see if there was any more clue

 kairavaan kii is story kii jaanch hamane apane str par nahin kii magar jab sibiai ke jaj brijagopal loya kii bahan kaa video bayaan dekha to laga ki kam se kam jaisi story he use us rup main bataaya ja saktaa he
 CBI Special Court Judge Brijgopal Loya was hearing the Sohrabuddin encounter case in which BJP national president Amit Shah was the main accused
 30 disambar 2014 ko sibiai ke special sibiai jaj embi gosaavi amit shah ko is aarope se bari kar dete hai
 The CBI did not appeal against this decision in the Upper Court
 apil karne kaa iraadaa he bhi yaa nahin, koun poochhega
 When people get scared of a printed story, who will ask why the appeal is not being made
 6 june 2014 ko special jaj utpat naaraazgi zaahir karte hai ki amit shah kyon nahin aae
 The judge orders that Amit Shah should appear in court on June 20, not come
 jaj utpat agali sunwaayee kii tarikh 26 june tay karte hai magar 25 june ko unka tabadalaa ho jaataa he
 The Supreme Court has ordered that the same officer in the Sohrabuddin case will remain in the investigation and hearing from beginning to end
 jaj utpat kaa tabadalaa pune ho jaataa he
 In his place comes 48 years Judge Brijgopal Harikshan Loya
 jaj loya amit shah ko nijee taur par haazir hone kii shart se chhot de dete hai
 It is said that they wanted to revisit the charge sheet of ten thousand pages, new judges were so and case sensitive as well
 unke saath rahane vaali bhanji nupur ne bataaya he ki is cese ko lekar bahut tanaav he
 There are many people involved in how to understand it
 isse kaise nipta jaae
 Bhanji told this to Niranjan Takle, a reporter for Caravan
 usee ke baad se niranjan ne is kahani kii padtaal shuru kar di
 On October 31, Judge Loya asked why Amit Shah is not present
 shah ke vakil kehete hai ki unhone khud haazir naa hone kii chhot di he
 Loya reminds that the exemption was when Shah was outside the state, on that day Shah was in Mumbai
 1 disambar 2014 kii subah nagpur main justise loya kii maut hoti he
 On December 15, 2014, Amit Shah was to appear before Judge Loya
 30 disambar ko nae jaj emji gosaavi amit shah ko sabhi aaropon se bari kar dete hai
 The verdict states that Amit Shah was implicated for political reasons
 jaj kii maut vaali story main amit shah kaa zikr sirf sandarbh kii baat he, bataane ke liye ve kitne hai profile maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki kisi par ishaara kiya ja rahaa he, wo ham bilkul nahin kar rahe magar isi ek kaaran se yah bhi lagata he ki jaj loya kii maut se jude sawaalon ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie taaki kisi ko shaq na ho
 After all, his sister will have to tell what happened to her questions
 jaj loya nagpur nahin janaa chaahate the
 a judge's daughter was to go to the wedding there, but two judges say that she should walk
 unke kehane par ve nagpur jate hai
 After returning from marriage, he talks to his wife in Mumbai and after that his family does not know anything
 subah ek phone aata he ki jaj loya mar gaye hai
 Now you will go to Sihar after reading and listening to the question and incident written by Niranjan Takle referring to the doctor sister of Judge Loya
 kisi kii maut dil kaa daura padane se ho sakati he magar ek jaj kii maut hogi uske postmortem se lekar laash ko patni or bete ke ghar bhejne kii jagah baap ke paas gaanv bhejne kaa faisla koi or kar legaa, yah sab sawaal itani aasaani se hajam nahin hote hai
 a judge has a protocol for trivia
 unki bahan ne jo baat bataai he unke anusaar parivaar kaa faisla nahin tha ki nagpur se loya kii laash mumbai jaaegi yaa unke gaanv
 Just family members get a call that their corpse is being sent to Gategaon in Latur
 getgaanv main loya ke pita rahete hai, loya kii teen bahanen dhule, jalgaanv or aurangabad main rahati hai
 After asking whom, Justice Loya's body is sent to Gategaon instead of Mumbai
 yahi nahin laash ke saath koi suraksha nahin thi, koi police vaala nahin tha, koi protocol nahin tha
 The driver of the ambulance descends the corpse alone to Gategaon
 jin do jajon ke saath jaj loya gaye the, ve dedh maheene tak parivaar se sampark nahin karte hai
 Those judges also do not come to Gategaon with the corpse of their colleague
 yah video hamen kairavaan patrika ne di he
 In Marathi, Judge Loya's sister Anuradha Biyani is speaking with whom Loya used to talk a lot, asking medicines for trivial matters
 isliye bahan ko pataa tha ki bhai ko kis tarah kii takalif he
 Doctor sister does not agree with the reasons given for the heart attack in the post mortem report
 un kaarnon kaa unke parivaar main koi history nahin he
 The sister has a habit of writing a diary
 ve har din kii baatcheet likhti rahati thim
 That conversation revealed that he allegedly received information from RSS activist Ishwar Baheti
 kairavaan patrika ke reporter ne ishwar baheti se sawaal kiya he magar jawaab nahin aayaa he
 This is the sister who brings Justice Loya's phone to Anuradha Bayani's house a few days later
 anuraadhaa ke man main sawaal daudane lagata he ki jaj kaa phone ek ishwar baheti ko kaise mila
 If the judge dies, then his belongings will be seized and the police will be brought by law
 yahi nahin anuraadhaa kii ek or bahan sarita mandhane ke paas kisi jaj kaa phone aata he
 Sarita was in Latur that day
 bhai kii maut kii khabar milte hi latur ke ek astpal main bhartee apane bhattije ko lene jaati hai
 But there is the same God who flirts with Anuradha's house
 sarita ne dhyaan to nahin diya magar yah sawaal dhans gaya ki ye ishwar baheti koun he jo bhai kii maut kii khabar lekar aata he
 Baheti tells them that there is no need to go to Nagpur
 vahaan se laash ambulance ke zarie getgaanv bheji ja chuki he
 Baheti takes them home
 bahanon ko bahut baat main dhyaan aata he ek jaj kii maut hui he, na police na prashasan
 How does an RSS person know all this much
 jab loya kaa antim sanskaar hota he tab kai jaj shaamil hote hai
 There some judges refuse the wife and son to talk to anyone
 donon ajtak bolne kii himmat nahin juta paae, main samaj saktaa hum, aapako bhi samajhnaa chahie
 All that is needed is to live like that so much to be scared
 dilli main haratosh bal, apurvanand, shabnam hashmi, manisha sethi or saidaa hamid ne press conference kii or puri baat bataai
 Media cameras and reporters are present here, hopefully you will get to read about this news in the newspapers of 23 November
 mumkin he ki media hindu muslim kaa koi neshnal silebus lekar itnaa hangaamaa karegaa ki ye khabar dab jaaegi jaise kisi jaj kii maut kii khabar teen saal tak dabi rahati he
 This is also the fact that when everybody is hesitating to speak on this story, three to four people are holding a press conference and a reporter comes to Niranjan Takle too
 hamaare sahyogi umashankar singh is press conference ko cover karne gaye the
 The question about death is, of course, what is the problem with someone being investigated, why are there so much fear in speaking, are we beginning to embrace fear, it is not good for anyone
 dar baantnaa band kiijie, kisi par shaq bhi karnaa band kiijie lekin jab koi sawaal kar de to sarkaar or adaalat kaa kaam he ki jawaab kaa aashwaasan de or jawaab bhi de
 Based on the talk of sister Anuradha Biyani and based on her investigation, the details that Niranjan Takle has collected related to the night of death are frightening
 jaj loya nagpur ke viipi guestaouse ravi bhawan main tehre the
 Where many judges, many big officials were also staying at that time
 jab seene main dard kii shikaayat hoti he to unhen auto se le jaaya jaataa he
 Was there not a single car in that guest house, how was it taken by auto rickshaw
 ravi bhawan se do kimi kii duuri par auto rickshaw stand hai
 Loya is taken to a hospital where the ECG machine was not working
 vahaan se unhen duusare aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he
 Where he is declared dead
 yah bhi pataa nahin chal paaya he ki justise loya ko aspataal lekar koun gaya
 Who took a judge from the VIP guest house with him in an auto
 jab maut hui thi tab media main khabar chhapi thi, dil kaa daura padane se maut kii khabar ko sabane saamaanya taur par liya
 No one was suspicious
 magar anuraadhaa biani or niranjan taakale apni padtaal se kuch aise sawaal nikaalte hai jo pehali nazar main dekhne par vaaki pathar se bhi zyaada thos lagate hai
 Every page of the post-mortem is signed by a person
 dastakhat ke neeche likhaa he ki yah loya kaa chachera bhai he
 Anuradha Biyani says that she has no cousin
 record ke anusaar loya kaa shav ise saunpa jaataa he
 But only the driver had gone with the corpse in the ambulance
 vah aadmi koun tha or kahaan he is vakt jiskaa dastakhat he
 The comments report bahut lambii he or daraavnee he
 If the questions related to the death of a judge can remain incomplete, then under which system are we living? kairavaan ne ek or report chhaapi he, is report ke baad
 In which it is told that a judge was allegedly offered a bribe of hundred crores to settle this case
 iskaa zikr yahaan nahin kyonki jaj kii maut se jude sawaal abhi khatm nahin hue hai
 You must have understood why there is a snowflake in Delhi
 kya ek jaj kii maut kii jaanch se lekar postermart report tak main itane antar ho sakate hai, sunanda pushkar kii postmortem report to rose tivi par khulti he, khulani bhi chahie magar justise loya ke parivaar waalon ko kya jawaab milegaa
 Two sources from Nagpur's Sitavadi Police Station and Government Medical College told Niranjan Takle that he had seen the body at midnight, his post-mortem was also done at the same time
 magar postmortem report main mrityu kii soochna kaa vakt sava chah baje he
 The post mortem starts at 10:55 am and ends at 1155
 jaahir maut kaa samay or postmart ke samay ko lekar do tarah kii raay he
 Should this report simply be ignored, in whose interest it is to ignore these questions, a judge dies, his son and wife are unable to muster the courage to speak if the Chief Justice of India does not trust him Should be given, they should not be encouraged to speak
 aakhir jab ek naagarik dar ke kaaran jeene kaa, bolne kaa hausala chhod degaa to koun hausala degaa
 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases
 bahut mushkil he kahana ki kisi kii hatya kaa sambandh kis maamle se the magar kya yah jaananaa zaruri nahin ki ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, uske jawaab kab or kaise milenge
 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone
 main bhi aapse ek baat kahana chahta hum
 i was also scared but did it so that Anuradha Biyani did not feel that her brother was killed by anyone and there was no one to speak
 loya ke bete ko ye na lage ki is desh main koi kisi ke liye bolta nahin he
 It's not like this
 mujhe ummid he koi bole na bole, pradhanmantri or bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish zarur bolenge ki darane kii baat nahin he
 Questions that will be investigated

 bhai kii maut kii khabar milte hi latur ke ek astpal main bhartee apane bhattije ko lene jaati hai
 But there is the same God who flirts with Anuradha's house
 sarita ne dhyaan to nahin diya magar yah sawaal dhans gaya ki ye ishwar baheti koun he jo bhai kii maut kii khabar lekar aata he
 Baheti tells them that there is no need to go to Nagpur
 vahaan se laash ambulance ke zarie getgaanv bheji ja chuki he
 Baheti takes them home
 bahanon ko bahut baat main dhyaan aata he ek jaj kii maut hui he, na police na prashasan
 How does an RSS person know all this much
 jab loya kaa antim sanskaar hota he tab kai jaj shaamil hote hai
 There some judges refuse the wife and son to talk to anyone
 donon ajtak bolne kii himmat nahin juta paae, main samaj saktaa hum, aapako bhi samajhnaa chahie
 All that is needed is to live like that so much to be scared
 dilli main haratosh bal, apurvanand, shabnam hashmi, manisha sethi or saidaa hamid ne press conference kii or puri baat bataai
 Media cameras and reporters are present here, hopefully you will get to read about this news in the newspapers of 23 November
 mumkin he ki media hindu muslim kaa koi neshnal silebus lekar itnaa hangaamaa karegaa ki ye khabar dab jaaegi jaise kisi jaj kii maut kii khabar teen saal tak dabi rahati he
 This is also the fact that when everybody is hesitating to speak on this story, three to four people are holding a press conference and a reporter comes to Niranjan Takle too
 hamaare sahyogi umashankar singh is press conference ko cover karne gaye the
 The question about death is, of course, what is the problem with someone being investigated, why are there so much fear in speaking, are we beginning to embrace fear, it is not good for anyone
 dar baantnaa band kiijie, kisi par shaq bhi karnaa band kiijie lekin jab koi sawaal kar de to sarkaar or adaalat kaa kaam he ki jawaab kaa aashwaasan de or jawaab bhi de
 Based on the talk of sister Anuradha Biyani and based on her investigation, the details that Niranjan Takle has collected related to the night of death are frightening
 jaj loya nagpur ke viipi guestaouse ravi bhawan main tehre the
 Where many judges, many big officials were also staying at that time
 jab seene main dard kii shikaayat hoti he to unhen auto se le jaaya jaataa he
 Was there not a single car in that guest house, how was it taken by auto rickshaw
 ravi bhawan se do kimi kii duuri par auto rickshaw stand hai
 Loya is taken to a hospital where the ECG machine was not working
 vahaan se unhen duusare aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he
 Where he is declared dead
 yah bhi pataa nahin chal paaya he ki justise loya ko aspataal lekar koun gaya
 Who took a judge from the VIP guest house with him in an auto
 jab maut hui thi tab media main khabar chhapi thi, dil kaa daura padane se maut kii khabar ko sabane saamaanya taur par liya
 No one was suspicious
 magar anuraadhaa biani or niranjan taakale apni padtaal se kuch aise sawaal nikaalte hai jo pehali nazar main dekhne par vaaki pathar se bhi zyaada thos lagate hai
 Every page of the post-mortem is signed by a person
 dastakhat ke neeche likhaa he ki yah loya kaa chachera bhai he
 Anuradha Biyani says that she has no cousin
 record ke anusaar loya kaa shav ise saunpa jaataa he
 But only the driver had gone with the corpse in the ambulance
 vah aadmi koun tha or kahaan he is vakt jiskaa dastakhat he
 The comments report bahut lambii he or daraavnee he
 If the questions related to the death of a judge can remain incomplete, then under which system are we living? kairavaan ne ek or report chhaapi he, is report ke baad
 In which it is told that a judge was allegedly offered a bribe of hundred crores to settle this case
 iskaa zikr yahaan nahin kyonki jaj kii maut se jude sawaal abhi khatm nahin hue hai
 You must have understood why there is a snowflake in Delhi
 kya ek jaj kii maut kii jaanch se lekar postermart report tak main itane antar ho sakate hai, sunanda pushkar kii postmortem report to rose tivi par khulti he, khulani bhi chahie magar justise loya ke parivaar waalon ko kya jawaab milegaa
 Two sources from Nagpur's Sitavadi Police Station and Government Medical College told Niranjan Takle that he had seen the body at midnight, his post-mortem was also done at the same time
 magar postmortem report main mrityu kii soochna kaa vakt sava chah baje he
 The post mortem starts at 10:55 am and ends at 1155
 jaahir maut kaa samay or postmart ke samay ko lekar do tarah kii raay he
 Should this report simply be ignored, in whose interest it is to ignore these questions, a judge dies, his son and wife are unable to muster the courage to speak if the Chief Justice of India does not trust him Should be given, they should not be encouraged to speak
 aakhir jab ek naagarik dar ke kaaran jeene kaa, bolne kaa hausala chhod degaa to koun hausala degaa
 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases
 bahut mushkil he kahana ki kisi kii hatya kaa sambandh kis maamle se the magar kya yah jaananaa zaruri nahin ki ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, uske jawaab kab or kaise milenge
 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone
 main bhi aapse ek baat kahana chahta hum
 i was also scared but did it so that Anuradha Biyani did not feel that her brother was killed by anyone and there was no one to speak
 loya ke bete ko ye na lage ki is desh main koi kisi ke liye bolta nahin he
 It's not like this
 mujhe ummid he koi bole na bole, pradhanmantri or bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish zarur bolenge ki darane kii baat nahin he
 Questions that will be investigated
 6 june 2014 ko special jaj utpat naaraazgi zaahir karte hai ki amit shah kyon nahin aae
 The judge orders that Amit Shah should appear in court on June 20, not come
 jaj utpat agali sunwaayee kii tarikh 26 june tay karte hai magar 25 june ko unka tabadalaa ho jaataa he
 The Supreme Court has ordered that the same officer in the Sohrabuddin case will remain in the investigation and hearing from beginning to end
 jaj utpat kaa tabadalaa pune ho jaataa he
 In his place comes 48 years Judge Brijgopal Harikshan Loya
 jaj loya amit shah ko nijee taur par haazir hone kii shart se chhot de dete hai
 It is said that they wanted to revisit the charge sheet of ten thousand pages, new judges were so and case sensitive as well
 unke saath rahane vaali bhanji nupur ne bataaya he ki is cese ko lekar bahut tanaav he
 There are many people involved in how to understand it
 isse kaise nipta jaae
 Bhanji told this to Niranjan Takle, a reporter for Caravan
 usee ke baad se niranjan ne is kahani kii padtaal shuru kar di
 On October 31, Judge Loya asked why Amit Shah is not present
 shah ke vakil kehete hai ki unhone khud haazir naa hone kii chhot di he
 Loya reminds that the exemption was when Shah was outside the state, on that day Shah was in Mumbai
 1 disambar 2014 kii subah nagpur main justise loya kii maut hoti he
 On December 15, 2014, Amit Shah was to appear before Judge Loya
 30 disambar ko nae jaj emji gosaavi amit shah ko sabhi aaropon se bari kar dete hai
 The verdict states that Amit Shah was implicated for political reasons
 jaj kii maut vaali story main amit shah kaa zikr sirf sandarbh kii baat he, bataane ke liye ve kitne hai profile maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki kisi par ishaara kiya ja rahaa he, wo ham bilkul nahin kar rahe magar isi ek kaaran se yah bhi lagata he ki jaj loya kii maut se jude sawaalon ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie taaki kisi ko shaq na ho
 After all, his sister will have to tell what happened to her questions
 jaj loya nagpur nahin janaa chaahate the
 a judge's daughter was to go to the wedding there, but two judges say that she should walk
 unke kehane par ve nagpur jate hai
 After returning from marriage, he talks to his wife in Mumbai and after that his family does not know anything
 subah ek phone aata he ki jaj loya mar gaye hai
 Now you will go to Sihar after reading and listening to the question and incident written by Niranjan Takle referring to the doctor sister of Judge Loya
 kisi kii maut dil kaa daura padane se ho sakati he magar ek jaj kii maut hogi uske postmortem se lekar laash ko patni or bete ke ghar bhejne kii jagah baap ke paas gaanv bhejne kaa faisla koi or kar legaa, yah sab sawaal itani aasaani se hajam nahin hote hai
 a judge has a protocol for trivia
 unki bahan ne jo baat bataai he unke anusaar parivaar kaa faisla nahin tha ki nagpur se loya kii laash mumbai jaaegi yaa unke gaanv
 Just family members get a call that their corpse is being sent to Gategaon in Latur
 getgaanv main loya ke pita rahete hai, loya kii teen bahanen dhule, jalgaanv or aurangabad main rahati hai
 After asking whom, Justice Loya's body is sent to Gategaon instead of Mumbai
 yahi nahin laash ke saath koi suraksha nahin thi, koi police vaala nahin tha, koi protocol nahin tha
 The driver of the ambulance descends the corpse alone to Gategaon
 jin do jajon ke saath jaj loya gaye the, ve dedh maheene tak parivaar se sampark nahin karte hai
 Those judges also do not come to Gategaon with the corpse of their colleague
 yah video hamen kairavaan patrika ne di he
 In Marathi, Judge Loya's sister Anuradha Biyani is speaking with whom Loya used to talk a lot, asking medicines for trivial matters
 isliye bahan ko pataa tha ki bhai ko kis tarah kii takalif he
 Doctor sister does not agree with the reasons given for the heart attack in the post mortem report
 un kaarnon kaa unke parivaar main koi history nahin he
 The sister has a habit of writing a diary
 ve har din kii baatcheet likhti rahati thim
 That conversation revealed that he allegedly received information from RSS activist Ishwar Baheti
 kairavaan patrika ke reporter ne ishwar baheti se sawaal kiya he magar jawaab nahin aayaa he
 This is the sister who brings Justice Loya's phone to Anuradha Bayani's house a few days later
 anuraadhaa ke man main sawaal daudane lagata he ki jaj kaa phone ek ishwar baheti ko kaise mila
 If the judge dies, then his belongings will be seized and the police will be brought by law
 yahi nahin anuraadhaa kii ek or bahan sarita mandhane ke paas kisi jaj kaa phone aata he
 Sarita was in Latur that day
 bhai kii maut kii khabar milte hi latur ke ek astpal main bhartee apane bhattije ko lene jaati hai
 But there is the same God who flirts with Anuradha's house
 sarita ne dhyaan to nahin diya magar yah sawaal dhans gaya ki ye ishwar baheti koun he jo bhai kii maut kii khabar lekar aata he
 Baheti tells them that there is no need to go to Nagpur
 vahaan se laash ambulance ke zarie getgaanv bheji ja chuki he
 Baheti takes them home
 bahanon ko bahut baat main dhyaan aata he ek jaj kii maut hui he, na police na prashasan
 How does an RSS person know all this much
 jab loya kaa antim sanskaar hota he tab kai jaj shaamil hote hai
 There some judges refuse the wife and son to talk to anyone

 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases
 bahut mushkil he kahana ki kisi kii hatya kaa sambandh kis maamle se the magar kya yah jaananaa zaruri nahin ki ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, uske jawaab kab or kaise milenge
 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone
 main bhi aapse ek baat kahana chahta hum
 i was also scared but did it so that Anuradha Biyani did not feel that her brother was killed by anyone and there was no one to speak
 loya ke bete ko ye na lage ki is desh main koi kisi ke liye bolta nahin he
 It's not like this
 mujhe ummid he koi bole na bole, pradhanmantri or bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish zarur bolenge ki darane kii baat nahin he
 Questions that will be investigated
 bhanji ne yah baat kairavaan ke reporter niranjan taakale ko bataai
 From then onwards Niranjan started investigating this story
 31 aktubar ko jaj loya ne poocha ki amit shah haazir kyon nahin hai
 Shah's lawyer says he has given himself up to not be present
 loya yaad dilaate hai ki chhot tab tha jab shah rajya ke baahar hon, us din shah mumbai main the
 Justice Loya dies in Nagpur on the morning of 1 December 2014
 15 disambar 2014 ko jaj loya ke saamne amit shah kii peshi honi thi
 On 30 December, new judge MG Gosavi acquits Amit Shah from all charges
 faisle main kaha jaataa he ki raajnneetik kaarnon se amit shah ko fansaaya gaya tha
 The reference to Amit Shah in the judge's death story is just a matter of context, to tell how many high profile cases he was hearing, it does not mean that anyone is being pointed out, we are not doing that at all, but For the same reason, it seems that the questions related to the death of Judge Loya should be taken seriously so that no one becomes suspicious
 aakhir unki bahan ko bataanaa to padegaa ki unke sawaalon kaa kya hua
 Judge Loya did not want to go to Nagpur
 vahaan ek jaj kii beti kii shaadi main janaa tha magar do jaj kehete hai ki chalanaa chahie
 They go to Nagpur at his behest
 shaadi se laut kar mumbai main apni patni se baat karte hai or uske baad unke parivaar ko kuch pataa nahin chalata
 a call comes in the morning that Judge Loya has died
 niranjan taakale ne jaj loya kii doctor bahan ke hawaale se jo sawaal or ghatana likhaa he ab aap use padhakar or sunakar sihar jaaenge
 Someone can die of a heart attack, but a judge will die
 From his post-mortem to someone else, the decision to send the corpse to the village near the father instead of sending it to the wife and son's house, will make the question so easy Are not
 ek jaj kaa maamuli baton ke liye protocol hota he
 According to what his sister has told, the family did not decide whether Loya's corpse would go to Mumbai or his village from Nagpur
 bas parivaar ke sadasyon ko phone aata he ki unki laash latur ke getgaanv bheji ja rahi he
 Loya's father lives in Getgaon, Loya's three sisters live in Dhule, Jalgaon and Aurangabad
 akhir kisase puch kar justise loya kii laash mumbai kii jagah getgaanv bheji jaati he
 Not only this, there was no protection with the corpse, there was no police, no protocol
 ebulence kaa dryver akele us laash ko getgaanv lekar utarataa he
 The two judges with whom the judge was taken do not contact the family for a month and a half
 ve jaj bhi apane sahyogi kii laash ke saath getgaanv nahin aate hai
 This video was given to us by Caravan magazine
 marathi main jaj loya kii bahan anuraadhaa biani bol rahi hai jinase loya kaaphi baat karte the, maamuli baton ke liye dawa poochhate the
 So the sister knew what kind of problem the brother had
 postmortem report main dil kaa daura padane ke jo kaaran bataae gaye hai, usase doctor bahan sahamat nahin hai
 Those reasons have no history in his family
 bahan kii aadat he diary likhane kii
 She kept writing every day's conversation
 us baatcheet se pataa chalaa ki unhen maut kii soochna kathith taur par aresas ke kaaryakarta ishwar baheti se milti he
 The reporter of Caravan magazine has questioned Ishwar Baheti but the answer has not come
 yahi baheti he jo kuch dinon baad anuraadhaa bayani ke ghar justise loya kaa phone lekar aata he
 Anuradha's question begins to run in the mind how the judge's phone was received by a god Baheti
 jaj kii maut hogi, to unke saamaanon kii zabti hogi or kaayade se police hi lekar aegi
 Not only this, another judge of Anuradha's sister Sarita Mandhane gets a call from a judge
 sarita us din latur main thi
 As soon as the news of his brother's death is received, he goes to pick up his nephew, who is admitted in a hospital in Latur
 lekin vahaan vahi ishwar baheti miltaa he jo phone lekar anuraadhaa ke ghar gaya tha
 Sarita did not pay attention, but the question was settled as to who is this God who flows and brings news of his brother's death
 baheti unhen kahata he ki nagpur jane kii zarurat nahin he
 From there, the body has been sent to Gategaon via ambulance
 baheti unhen ghar lekar jaataa he
 The sisters get a lot of attention from the fact that one judge has died, neither the police nor the administration
 aresas kaa ek aadmi itnaa sab kuch kaise jaanata he
 Many judges are involved when Loya is cremated
 vahaan kuch jaj patni or bete ko kisi se baat karne se manaa karte hai
 Both of them could not muster the courage to speak till today, i can understand, you should also understand
 bas itnaa hi kahana he ki aisa bhi kya jeena ki itnaa darana chahie
 In Delhi, Hartosh Bal, Apoorvanand, Shabnam Hashmi, Manisha Sethi and Syeda Hameed held a press conference and explained the whole thing
 yahaan media ke camere or reporter to maujuud nazar aa rahe hai, ummid he aapako 23 november ke akhbaaron main is khabar ke bare main padhane ko milegaa
 It is possible that the media will create such a ruckus by taking a national syllabus of Hindu Muslim that this news will be suppressed as if the news of the death of a judge is buried for three years
 yahi khubi bhi he ki jab sab log is story par bolne se kataraa rahe hai teen chaar log press conference kar rahe hai or ek reporter niranjan taakale bhi aata he to yah story kar detaa he
 Our colleague Umashankar Singh went to cover this press conference
 maut ko lekar sawaal hi to he, zaahir he jaanch hone main kisi ko kya dikkat he, bolne main itnaa dar kyon hai, kya ham dar ko gale lagane lage hai, yah kisi ke liye acha nahin he
 Stop sharing fear, stop doubting anyone, but when someone asks a question, it is the job of the government and the court to give assurance and answer
 bahan anuraadhaa biani kii baton or apni jaanch ke aadhaar par niranjan taakale ne maut kii raat se jude jo detail jutaaye hai, wo daraane vaale hai
 Judge Loya stayed at Nagpur's VIP guesthouse Ravi Bhavan
 jahaan us vakt kai jaj, kai bade adhikari bhi tehre the
 They are taken by auto when there are complaints of chest pain
 kya us guest house main ek bhi gaadi nahin thi, auto rickshaw se kaise le jaaya gaya
 There are auto rickshaw stands two km from Ravi Bhavan
 loya ko ek aise aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he jahaan isiji mashin kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 From there he is taken to another hospital
 jahaan unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 It is also not known who took Justice Loya to the hospital
 viipi guest house se ek jaj ko auto main bithakar koun le gaya tha
 When the death took place, there was a news in the media, everyone took the news of the death due to a heart attack
 kisi ko shaq bhi nahin hua
 But Anuradha Biyani and Niranjan Takle draw out some questions from their investigations that at first glance look really more concrete than stone
 postmortem ke har panne par ek vyakti ke dastakhat he
 It is written under the sign that it is Loya's cousin
 anuraadhaa biani kahati hai ki unka koi chachera bhai nahin he
 According to the records, the body of Loya is assigned to it
 magar ambulance main laash lekar to sirf driver gaya tha
 Who was the man and where is he signed at the moment
 tippaniyan The report is very long and scary
 agar ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaal adhure rah sakate hai to ham kis vyavastha main ji rahe hai
 Caravan has published another report, following this report
 jisamen bataaya he ki ek jaj ko is cese ko nipataane ke liye sau karod ke rishwat kii kathith rup se peshkash hui thi
 It is not mentioned here because the questions related to the death of the judge are not over yet
 aap samaj gaye honge ki kyon dilli par barf kii silli padi he
 Can there be so much difference between the investigation of a judge's death and the post-mortem report, Sunanda Pushkar's post-mortem report opens on TV every day, it should also be opened but what answer will be given to the family of Justice Loya
 nagpur ke sitavdi police stesan or sarkari medical college ke do sutron ne niranjan taakale ko bataaya ki unhone aadhi raat ko hi shav dekh liya tha, uskaa postmortem bhi usee vakt kar liya gaya tha
 But in the post-mortem report, the time of the notice of death is six and a quarter
 postmortem shuru hota he 10 bajkar 55 minute par or khatm hota he 11 bajkar 55 minute par
 There are obviously two types of opinion about the time of death and the time of postmart
 kya is report ko yun hi andekha kar diya janaa chahie, kiske hit main in sawaalon ko andekha karnaa, ek jaj kii maut hoti he, unka betaa or patni bolne kaa saahas nahin juta pate to kya bharat ke pramukh nyaayadhish ko unhen suraksha kaa bharosa nahin dena chahie, unhen bolne kaa hausala nahin dena chahie
 After all, when a citizen will give up the courage to live, to speak because of fear, then who will give encouragement
 kya satta ko hamane dar kaa chadar bana liya he ki wo daraati rahegi or ham us dar kii chadar ko taan kar sote rahenge, uske neeche dar se kaanpate rahenge, sawaal simpal he, jaj tamaam tarah ke maamalon kii sunwaayee karte hai
 It is very difficult to say what was the matter related to the murder of someone, but it is not necessary to know that questions are being raised about the death of a judge, when and how to get his answers
 agar is story ke sandarbh se kisi ko dar he to kya bina sandarbh ke parvaah kiye sirf jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab nahi khoja saktaa he
 The answer is also important for a common citizen
 varanaa sabko lagegaa ki jab ek jaj ke saath aisa ho saktaa he to phir kisi ke saath ho saktaa he
 i also want to tell you one thing
 mujhe bhi dar laga tha, lekin isliye ise kiya taaki anuraadhaa biani ko ye na lage ki uske bhai ko kisi ne maar diya or bolne vaala koi nahin tha
 Loya's son does not feel that in this country no one speaks for anyone
 aisa nahin he
 i hope no one says, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India will surely say that there is nothing to fear
 jo sawaal hai unki jaanch hogi
 The verdict states that Amit Shah was implicated for political reasons
 jaj kii maut vaali story main amit shah kaa zikr sirf sandarbh kii baat he, bataane ke liye ve kitne hai profile maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki kisi par ishaara kiya ja rahaa he, wo ham bilkul nahin kar rahe magar isi ek kaaran se yah bhi lagata he ki jaj loya kii maut se jude sawaalon ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie taaki kisi ko shaq na ho
 After all, his sister will have to tell what happened to her questions
 jaj loya nagpur nahin janaa chaahate the
 a judge's daughter was to go to the wedding there, but two judges say that she should walk
 unke kehane par ve nagpur jate hai
 After returning from marriage, he talks to his wife in Mumbai and after that his family does not know anything
 subah ek phone aata he ki jaj loya mar gaye hai
 Now you will go to Sihar after reading and listening to the question and incident written by Niranjan Takle referring to the doctor sister of Judge Loya
 kisi kii maut dil kaa daura padane se ho sakati he magar ek jaj kii maut hogi uske postmortem se lekar laash ko patni or bete ke ghar bhejne kii jagah baap ke paas gaanv bhejne kaa faisla koi or kar legaa, yah sab sawaal itani aasaani se hajam nahin hote hai
 a judge has a protocol for trivia
 unki bahan ne jo baat bataai he unke anusaar parivaar kaa faisla nahin tha ki nagpur se loya kii laash mumbai jaaegi yaa unke gaanv
 Just family members get a call that their corpse is being sent to Gategaon in Latur
 getgaanv main loya ke pita rahete hai, loya kii teen bahanen dhule, jalgaanv or aurangabad main rahati hai
 After asking whom, Justice Loya's body is sent to Gategaon instead of Mumbai
 yahi nahin laash ke saath koi suraksha nahin thi, koi police vaala nahin tha, koi protocol nahin tha
 The driver of the ambulance descends the corpse alone to Gategaon
 jin do jajon ke saath jaj loya gaye the, ve dedh maheene tak parivaar se sampark nahin karte hai
 Those judges also do not come to Gategaon with the corpse of their colleague

 In Marathi, Judge Loya's sister Anuradha Biyani is speaking with whom Loya used to talk a lot, asking medicines for trivial matters
 isliye bahan ko pataa tha ki bhai ko kis tarah kii takalif he
 Doctor sister does not agree with the reasons given for the heart attack in the post mortem report
 un kaarnon kaa unke parivaar main koi history nahin he
 The sister has a habit of writing a diary
 ve har din kii baatcheet likhti rahati thim
 That conversation revealed that he allegedly received information from RSS activist Ishwar Baheti
 kairavaan patrika ke reporter ne ishwar baheti se sawaal kiya he magar jawaab nahin aayaa he
 This is the sister who brings Justice Loya's phone to Anuradha Bayani's house a few days later
 anuraadhaa ke man main sawaal daudane lagata he ki jaj kaa phone ek ishwar baheti ko kaise mila
 If the judge dies, then his belongings will be seized and the police will be brought by law
 yahi nahin anuraadhaa kii ek or bahan sarita mandhane ke paas kisi jaj kaa phone aata he
 Sarita was in Latur that day
 bhai kii maut kii khabar milte hi latur ke ek astpal main bhartee apane bhattije ko lene jaati hai
 But there is the same God who flirts with Anuradha's house
 sarita ne dhyaan to nahin diya magar yah sawaal dhans gaya ki ye ishwar baheti koun he jo bhai kii maut kii khabar lekar aata he
 Baheti tells them that there is no need to go to Nagpur
 vahaan se laash ambulance ke zarie getgaanv bheji ja chuki he
 Baheti takes them home
 bahanon ko bahut baat main dhyaan aata he ek jaj kii maut hui he, na police na prashasan
 How does an RSS person know all this much
 jab loya kaa antim sanskaar hota he tab kai jaj shaamil hote hai
 There some judges refuse the wife and son to talk to anyone
 donon ajtak bolne kii himmat nahin juta paae, main samaj saktaa hum, aapako bhi samajhnaa chahie
 All that is needed is to live like that so much to be scared
 dilli main haratosh bal, apurvanand, shabnam hashmi, manisha sethi or saidaa hamid ne press conference kii or puri baat bataai
 Media cameras and reporters are present here, hopefully you will get to read about this news in the newspapers of 23 November
 mumkin he ki media hindu muslim kaa koi neshnal silebus lekar itnaa hangaamaa karegaa ki ye khabar dab jaaegi jaise kisi jaj kii maut kii khabar teen saal tak dabi rahati he
 This is also the fact that when everybody is hesitating to speak on this story, three to four people are holding a press conference and a reporter comes to Niranjan Takle too
 hamaare sahyogi umashankar singh is press conference ko cover karne gaye the
 The question about death is, of course, what is the problem with someone being investigated, why are there so much fear in speaking, are we beginning to embrace fear, it is not good for anyone
 dar baantnaa band kiijie, kisi par shaq bhi karnaa band kiijie lekin jab koi sawaal kar de to sarkaar or adaalat kaa kaam he ki jawaab kaa aashwaasan de or jawaab bhi de
 Based on the talk of sister Anuradha Biyani and based on her investigation, the details that Niranjan Takle has collected related to the night of death are frightening
 jaj loya nagpur ke viipi guestaouse ravi bhawan main tehre the
 Where many judges, many big officials were also staying at that time

 You must have understood why there is a snowflake in Delhi
 kya ek jaj kii maut kii jaanch se lekar postermart report tak main itane antar ho sakate hai, sunanda pushkar kii postmortem report to rose tivi par khulti he, khulani bhi chahie magar justise loya ke parivaar waalon ko kya jawaab milegaa

 Should this report simply be ignored, in whose interest it is to ignore these questions, a judge dies, his son and wife are unable to muster the courage to speak if the Chief Justice of India does not trust him Should be given, they should not be encouraged to speak
 aakhir jab ek naagarik dar ke kaaran jeene kaa, bolne kaa hausala chhod degaa to koun hausala degaa
 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases
 bahut mushkil he kahana ki kisi kii hatya kaa sambandh kis maamle se the magar kya yah jaananaa zaruri nahin ki ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, uske jawaab kab or kaise milenge
 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone
 main bhi aapse ek baat kahana chahta hum
 i was also scared but did it so that Anuradha Biyani did not feel that her brother was killed by anyone and there was no one to speak
 loya ke bete ko ye na lage ki is desh main koi kisi ke liye bolta nahin he
 It's not like this
 mujhe ummid he koi bole na bole, pradhanmantri or bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish zarur bolenge ki darane kii baat nahin he

 getgaanv main loya ke pita rahete hai, loya kii teen bahanen dhule, jalgaanv or aurangabad main rahati hai
 After asking whom, Justice Loya's body is sent to Gategaon instead of Mumbai
 yahi nahin laash ke saath koi suraksha nahin thi, koi police vaala nahin tha, koi protocol nahin tha
 The driver of the ambulance descends the corpse alone to Gategaon

 Questions that will be investigated
 jaj kii maut hogi, to unke saamaanon kii zabti hogi or kaayade se police hi lekar aegi
 Not only this, another judge of Anuradha's sister Sarita Mandhane gets a call from a judge
 sarita us din latur main thi
 As soon as the news of his brother's death is received, he goes to pick up his nephew, who is admitted in a hospital in Latur
 lekin vahaan vahi ishwar baheti miltaa he jo phone lekar anuraadhaa ke ghar gaya tha
 Sarita did not pay attention, but the question was settled as to who is this God who flows and brings news of his brother's death
 baheti unhen kahata he ki nagpur jane kii zarurat nahin he
 From there, the body has been sent to Gategaon via ambulance
 baheti unhen ghar lekar jaataa he
 The sisters get a lot of attention from the fact that one judge has died, neither the police nor the administration
 aresas kaa ek aadmi itnaa sab kuch kaise jaanata he
 Many judges are involved when Loya is cremated
 vahaan kuch jaj patni or bete ko kisi se baat karne se manaa karte hai
 Both of them could not muster the courage to speak till today, i can understand, you should also understand
 bas itnaa hi kahana he ki aisa bhi kya jeena ki itnaa darana chahie
 In Delhi, Hartosh Bal, Apoorvanand, Shabnam Hashmi, Manisha Sethi and Syeda Hameed held a press conference and explained the whole thing
 yahaan media ke camere or reporter to maujuud nazar aa rahe hai, ummid he aapako 23 november ke akhbaaron main is khabar ke bare main padhane ko milegaa
 It is possible that the media will create such a ruckus by taking a national syllabus of Hindu Muslim that this news will be suppressed as if the news of the death of a judge is buried for three years
 yahi khubi bhi he ki jab sab log is story par bolne se kataraa rahe hai teen chaar log press conference kar rahe hai or ek reporter niranjan taakale bhi aata he to yah story kar detaa he
 Our colleague Umashankar Singh went to cover this press conference
 maut ko lekar sawaal hi to he, zaahir he jaanch hone main kisi ko kya dikkat he, bolne main itnaa dar kyon hai, kya ham dar ko gale lagane lage hai, yah kisi ke liye acha nahin he
 Stop sharing fear, stop doubting anyone, but when someone asks a question, it is the job of the government and the court to give assurance and answer
 bahan anuraadhaa biani kii baton or apni jaanch ke aadhaar par niranjan taakale ne maut kii raat se jude jo detail jutaaye hai, wo daraane vaale hai
 Judge Loya stayed at Nagpur's VIP guesthouse Ravi Bhavan
 jahaan us vakt kai jaj, kai bade adhikari bhi tehre the
 They are taken by auto when there are complaints of chest pain
 kya us guest house main ek bhi gaadi nahin thi, auto rickshaw se kaise le jaaya gaya
 There are auto rickshaw stands two km from Ravi Bhavan
 loya ko ek aise aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he jahaan isiji mashin kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 From there he is taken to another hospital
 jahaan unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 It is also not known who took Justice Loya to the hospital
 viipi guest house se ek jaj ko auto main bithakar koun le gaya tha
 When the death took place, there was a news in the media, everyone took the news of the death due to a heart attack
 kisi ko shaq bhi nahin hua
 But Anuradha Biyani and Niranjan Takle draw out some questions from their investigations that at first glance look really more concrete than stone
 postmortem ke har panne par ek vyakti ke dastakhat he
 It is written under the sign that it is Loya's cousin
 anuraadhaa biani kahati hai ki unka koi chachera bhai nahin he
 According to the records, the body of Loya is assigned to it
 magar ambulance main laash lekar to sirf driver gaya tha
 Who was the man and where is he signed at the moment
 tippaniyan The report is very long and scary
 agar ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaal adhure rah sakate hai to ham kis vyavastha main ji rahe hai
 Caravan has published another report, following this report
 jisamen bataaya he ki ek jaj ko is cese ko nipataane ke liye sau karod ke rishwat kii kathith rup se peshkash hui thi
 It is not mentioned here because the questions related to the death of the judge are not over yet
 aap samaj gaye honge ki kyon dilli par barf kii silli padi he
 Can there be so much difference between the investigation of a judge's death and the post-mortem report, Sunanda Pushkar's post-mortem report opens on TV every day, it should also be opened but what answer will be given to the family of Justice Loya
 nagpur ke sitavdi police stesan or sarkari medical college ke do sutron ne niranjan taakale ko bataaya ki unhone aadhi raat ko hi shav dekh liya tha, uskaa postmortem bhi usee vakt kar liya gaya tha
 But in the post-mortem report, the time of the notice of death is six and a quarter
 postmortem shuru hota he 10 bajkar 55 minute par or khatm hota he 11 bajkar 55 minute par
 There are obviously two types of opinion about the time of death and the time of postmart
 kya is report ko yun hi andekha kar diya janaa chahie, kiske hit main in sawaalon ko andekha karnaa, ek jaj kii maut hoti he, unka betaa or patni bolne kaa saahas nahin juta pate to kya bharat ke pramukh nyaayadhish ko unhen suraksha kaa bharosa nahin dena chahie, unhen bolne kaa hausala nahin dena chahie
 After all, when a citizen will give up the courage to live, to speak because of fear, then who will give encouragement
 kya satta ko hamane dar kaa chadar bana liya he ki wo daraati rahegi or ham us dar kii chadar ko taan kar sote rahenge, uske neeche dar se kaanpate rahenge, sawaal simpal he, jaj tamaam tarah ke maamalon kii sunwaayee karte hai
 It is very difficult to say what was the matter related to the murder of someone, but it is not necessary to know that questions are being raised about the death of a judge, when and how to get his answers
 agar is story ke sandarbh se kisi ko dar he to kya bina sandarbh ke parvaah kiye sirf jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab nahi khoja saktaa he
 The answer is also important for a common citizen
 varanaa sabko lagegaa ki jab ek jaj ke saath aisa ho saktaa he to phir kisi ke saath ho saktaa he
 i also want to tell you one thing
 mujhe bhi dar laga tha, lekin isliye ise kiya taaki anuraadhaa biani ko ye na lage ki uske bhai ko kisi ne maar diya or bolne vaala koi nahin tha
 Loya's son does not feel that in this country no one speaks for anyone
 aisa nahin he
 i hope no one says, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India will surely say that there is nothing to fear
 jo sawaal hai unki jaanch hogi
 Many judges are involved when Loya is cremated
 vahaan kuch jaj patni or bete ko kisi se baat karne se manaa karte hai
 Both of them could not muster the courage to speak till today, i can understand, you should also understand
 bas itnaa hi kahana he ki aisa bhi kya jeena ki itnaa darana chahie
 In Delhi, Hartosh Bal, Apoorvanand, Shabnam Hashmi, Manisha Sethi and Syeda Hameed held a press conference and explained the whole thing
 yahaan media ke camere or reporter to maujuud nazar aa rahe hai, ummid he aapako 23 november ke akhbaaron main is khabar ke bare main padhane ko milegaa
 It is possible that the media will create such a ruckus by taking a national syllabus of Hindu Muslim that this news will be suppressed as if the news of the death of a judge is buried for three years
 yahi khubi bhi he ki jab sab log is story par bolne se kataraa rahe hai teen chaar log press conference kar rahe hai or ek reporter niranjan taakale bhi aata he to yah story kar detaa he
 Our colleague Umashankar Singh went to cover this press conference
 maut ko lekar sawaal hi to he, zaahir he jaanch hone main kisi ko kya dikkat he, bolne main itnaa dar kyon hai, kya ham dar ko gale lagane lage hai, yah kisi ke liye acha nahin he
 Stop sharing fear, stop doubting anyone, but when someone asks a question, it is the job of the government and the court to give assurance and answer
 bahan anuraadhaa biani kii baton or apni jaanch ke aadhaar par niranjan taakale ne maut kii raat se jude jo detail jutaaye hai, wo daraane vaale hai
 Judge Loya stayed at Nagpur's VIP guesthouse Ravi Bhavan
 jahaan us vakt kai jaj, kai bade adhikari bhi tehre the
 They are taken by auto when there are complaints of chest pain
 kya us guest house main ek bhi gaadi nahin thi, auto rickshaw se kaise le jaaya gaya
 There are auto rickshaw stands two km from Ravi Bhavan
 loya ko ek aise aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he jahaan isiji mashin kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 From there he is taken to another hospital
 jahaan unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 It is also not known who took Justice Loya to the hospital
 viipi guest house se ek jaj ko auto main bithakar koun le gaya tha
 When the death took place, there was a news in the media, everyone took the news of the death due to a heart attack
 kisi ko shaq bhi nahin hua
 But Anuradha Biyani and Niranjan Takle draw out some questions from their investigations that at first glance look really more concrete than stone
 postmortem ke har panne par ek vyakti ke dastakhat he
 It is written under the sign that it is Loya's cousin
 anuraadhaa biani kahati hai ki unka koi chachera bhai nahin he
 According to the records, the body of Loya is assigned to it
 magar ambulance main laash lekar to sirf driver gaya tha
 Who was the man and where is he signed at the moment
 tippaniyan The report is very long and scary
 agar ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaal adhure rah sakate hai to ham kis vyavastha main ji rahe hai
 Caravan has published another report, following this report
 jisamen bataaya he ki ek jaj ko is cese ko nipataane ke liye sau karod ke rishwat kii kathith rup se peshkash hui thi
 It is not mentioned here because the questions related to the death of the judge are not over yet
 aap samaj gaye honge ki kyon dilli par barf kii silli padi he
 Can there be so much difference between the investigation of a judge's death and the post-mortem report, Sunanda Pushkar's post-mortem report opens on TV every day, it should also be opened but what answer will be given to the family of Justice Loya
 nagpur ke sitavdi police stesan or sarkari medical college ke do sutron ne niranjan taakale ko bataaya ki unhone aadhi raat ko hi shav dekh liya tha, uskaa postmortem bhi usee vakt kar liya gaya tha
 But in the post-mortem report, the time of the notice of death is six and a quarter
 postmortem shuru hota he 10 bajkar 55 minute par or khatm hota he 11 bajkar 55 minute par
 There are obviously two types of opinion about the time of death and the time of postmart
 kya is report ko yun hi andekha kar diya janaa chahie, kiske hit main in sawaalon ko andekha karnaa, ek jaj kii maut hoti he, unka betaa or patni bolne kaa saahas nahin juta pate to kya bharat ke pramukh nyaayadhish ko unhen suraksha kaa bharosa nahin dena chahie, unhen bolne kaa hausala nahin dena chahie
 After all, when a citizen will give up the courage to live, to speak because of fear, then who will give encouragement
 kya satta ko hamane dar kaa chadar bana liya he ki wo daraati rahegi or ham us dar kii chadar ko taan kar sote rahenge, uske neeche dar se kaanpate rahenge, sawaal simpal he, jaj tamaam tarah ke maamalon kii sunwaayee karte hai
 It is very difficult to say what was the matter related to the murder of someone, but it is not necessary to know that questions are being raised about the death of a judge, when and how to get his answers
 agar is story ke sandarbh se kisi ko dar he to kya bina sandarbh ke parvaah kiye sirf jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab nahi khoja saktaa he
 The answer is also important for a common citizen
 varanaa sabko lagegaa ki jab ek jaj ke saath aisa ho saktaa he to phir kisi ke saath ho saktaa he
 i also want to tell you one thing
 mujhe bhi dar laga tha, lekin isliye ise kiya taaki anuraadhaa biani ko ye na lage ki uske bhai ko kisi ne maar diya or bolne vaala koi nahin tha
 Loya's son does not feel that in this country no one speaks for anyone
 aisa nahin he
 i hope no one says, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India will surely say that there is nothing to fear
 jo sawaal hai unki jaanch hogi
 The question about death is, of course, what is the problem with someone being investigated, why are there so much fear in speaking, are we beginning to embrace fear, it is not good for anyone
 dar baantnaa band kiijie, kisi par shaq bhi karnaa band kiijie lekin jab koi sawaal kar de to sarkaar or adaalat kaa kaam he ki jawaab kaa aashwaasan de or jawaab bhi de
 Based on the talk of sister Anuradha Biyani and based on her investigation, the details that Niranjan Takle has collected related to the night of death are frightening
 jaj loya nagpur ke viipi guestaouse ravi bhawan main tehre the
 Where many judges, many big officials were also staying at that time
 jab seene main dard kii shikaayat hoti he to unhen auto se le jaaya jaataa he
 Was there not a single car in that guest house, how was it taken by auto rickshaw
 ravi bhawan se do kimi kii duuri par auto rickshaw stand hai
 Loya is taken to a hospital where the ECG machine was not working
 vahaan se unhen duusare aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he
 Where he is declared dead
 yah bhi pataa nahin chal paaya he ki justise loya ko aspataal lekar koun gaya
 Who took a judge from the VIP guest house with him in an auto
 jab maut hui thi tab media main khabar chhapi thi, dil kaa daura padane se maut kii khabar ko sabane saamaanya taur par liya
 No one was suspicious
 magar anuraadhaa biani or niranjan taakale apni padtaal se kuch aise sawaal nikaalte hai jo pehali nazar main dekhne par vaaki pathar se bhi zyaada thos lagate hai
 Every page of the post-mortem is signed by a person
 dastakhat ke neeche likhaa he ki yah loya kaa chachera bhai he
 Anuradha Biyani says that she has no cousin
 record ke anusaar loya kaa shav ise saunpa jaataa he
 But only the driver had gone with the corpse in the ambulance
 vah aadmi koun tha or kahaan he is vakt jiskaa dastakhat he
 The comments report bahut lambii he or daraavnee he
 If the questions related to the death of a judge can remain incomplete, then under which system are we living? kairavaan ne ek or report chhaapi he, is report ke baad
 In which it is told that a judge was allegedly offered a bribe of hundred crores to settle this case
 iskaa zikr yahaan nahin kyonki jaj kii maut se jude sawaal abhi khatm nahin hue hai
 You must have understood why there is a snowflake in Delhi
 kya ek jaj kii maut kii jaanch se lekar postermart report tak main itane antar ho sakate hai, sunanda pushkar kii postmortem report to rose tivi par khulti he, khulani bhi chahie magar justise loya ke parivaar waalon ko kya jawaab milegaa
 Two sources from Nagpur's Sitavadi Police Station and Government Medical College told Niranjan Takle that he had seen the body at midnight, his post-mortem was also done at the same time
 magar postmortem report main mrityu kii soochna kaa vakt sava chah baje he
 The post mortem starts at 10:55 am and ends at 1155
 jaahir maut kaa samay or postmart ke samay ko lekar do tarah kii raay he
 Should this report simply be ignored, in whose interest it is to ignore these questions, a judge dies, his son and wife are unable to muster the courage to speak if the Chief Justice of India does not trust him Should be given, they should not be encouraged to speak
 aakhir jab ek naagarik dar ke kaaran jeene kaa, bolne kaa hausala chhod degaa to koun hausala degaa
 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases
 bahut mushkil he kahana ki kisi kii hatya kaa sambandh kis maamle se the magar kya yah jaananaa zaruri nahin ki ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, uske jawaab kab or kaise milenge
 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone
 main bhi aapse ek baat kahana chahta hum
 i was also scared but did it so that Anuradha Biyani did not feel that her brother was killed by anyone and there was no one to speak
 loya ke bete ko ye na lage ki is desh main koi kisi ke liye bolta nahin he
 It's not like this
 mujhe ummid he koi bole na bole, pradhanmantri or bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish zarur bolenge ki darane kii baat nahin he
 Questions that will be investigated

 When the youngsters were not bid in the IPL auction, this former Rajasthan Royals leg spinner was bought by Kolkata Knight Riders for his base price of Rs 20 lakhs
 tambe ne mumbai se pitiai se kaha, ''main aaj bhi is maansikta ke saath kheltaa hum jaise main 20 saal kaa yuva hum
 "he said," i will bring all my experience and energy to the team

 This thing has been explained in the Vidhan Sabha also
 kosikalan kasbe main das din purv huye sampradayik dange ke baad halaat kaa jayja lene pahunche ajam ne kaha ki kai baar doosraa danga hone tak jaanch chalati rahati he or uske parinaam saamne nahin aa pate
 He said that he himself has been in government thrice, has been in opposition
 khud nyaayik jaanch kii maang karte hai kintu ek bhi jaanch kaa parinaam saamne nahin aa paaya
 These checks keep going for a long time
 isse koi nyaay nahin mil saktaa
 He said that justice can be achieved only through the political system because the people of politics always think that if we do bad then we will get punishment for it
 agar sarkaar apni nishpakshta sabit nahin karegi to fail ho jaayenge
 Azam Khan said that the government is very ashamed of this incident
 kyonki sarkaar kaa gathan huye keval do maah hi huye or itnaa bada danga ho gaya
 The government has taken it as a challenge
 unhone kaha, ‘maamle kii tah tak jaayenge or pataa karenge ki kahin yah sab purv niojit to nahin tha
 Because where there has never been a riot on the biggest incident, how did it happen now? ’unhone yah jaankaree milane par ki dange ke virodh main bazaar band rakhane par jila prashasan jabardasti khulwaane ke prayaas kar rahaa he to kaha ki aisa karne kaa haq kisi ko nahin he
 The new song of 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' will surely touch the heart of Salman Khan's fans
 is gane ke bol hai 'jindagi kuch to bataa'
 The song has been shot on Kosalman Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Cute Baby Harshali Malhotra

 This entire song has been shot in Kashmir
 is gane kaa sangeet diya hapritamane or ise gaaya he jubin notial or pritam ne
 The lyrics of this song are written by Nilesh Mishra

 Earlier the songs 'selfie le le', 'tu should', 'bhar do jholi meri', 'aaji ki party' songs have been released

 From top leaders like Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and LK Advani to top academic personalities, writers and common people

 He had the ability to fill every gap

 They felt equally comfortable with him

 As (rudyard) Kipling said, "he was like a common man, despite being in conflict with the emperors
" ''main ek baar dakshin bharat main gaadi chalaa rahaa tha or ek kasbe main meri car pankchar ho gai

 Although he called himself a skeptic, he had studied various religions deeply
 unhen apane samet sabhi dharmon ke kattarpathiyon se nafrat thi or unki khilli udaane kaa koi mauka nahin chhodte the
 When he criticized poison-spewing preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, he was threatened with death and was provided 24-hour security by armed tents outside his flat
 lekin indira gandhi ne jab amritsar ke swarna mandir main fouj bheji to uske virodh main unhone apana padmabhushan waapas kar diya (baad main unhen padmavibhushan se sammanit kiya gaya)
 He was deeply hurt by the growing intolerance and communalism in the country in recent years and wanted more and more people to raise their voice against it

 He wrote and spoke from the heart, although at times he seemed politically unintelligent
 unhone khud ko gambhirtha se nahin liya
 Once he got a letter from abroad on which he had just written: "khushwant Singh, Bastard, India
 '' unhone yah kehete hue use sabko khushi-khushi dikhaaya ki dak vibhaag ko bhi maaloom he ki us patr ko kahaan daalana he! unke kollam ke aakhir main ek chutkula hota tha, jo priaru unheen ke samudaay ke bare main hota tha
 The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, the largest religious organization of Sikhs, once wrote a strict letter warning my father that he should desist from 'santa Banta' jokes
 unhone teen shabdon main unhen jawaab likh bhejaah ''bhaad main jaao
 After that, he did not receive any warning again

 Before the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, although all parties are opening a front against each other, the Samajwadi Party feels that Narendra Modi is the biggest obstacle in its path
 upi ke siem akhilesh yadav ko bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar se judaa sawaal poochna bhi acha nahin lag rahaa
 When the media asked Akhilesh about Modi if Modi's Dalit love would enable him to reach the power of the Center, the CM was agitated
 akhilesh ne gujarat ke siem par puche gaye is sawaal kaa jawaab dene ke bajaay mediawaalon par hi sawaal daag die
 He asked the questioning journalist why you are becoming so special to Modi

 On this, Akhilesh said, 'now everyone is aware about castes

 The CAG has said that allocating coal mines on an application basis rather than competitive bids gives potential 1 to select private firms

 He said that the policy adopted for allocation of coal blocks was not flawed
 is paardarshee or niti nahin ho sakati thi kyonki 2004 main pratispardhi boli kii vyavastha hi nahin thi
 Congress spokesperson Tiwari accused the BJP of adopting double standards and said that they have one behavior for the states and another for the center

 Union Sports Minister Vijay Goel on Friday asked the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and the National Sports Federation (NSF) to automatically share their information with the aim of bringing transparency in the activities of sports organizations

 For this, the Ministry has given the last date of 30 November

 But some NSF and IOA had provided incomplete information as complete information was not even available on their website
 kuch enesuef ne apni jaankaree hi nahin di thi or kuch kii website hi nahin thi
 The last date is 30 November 2016, the ministry said in a statement, "IOA and NSF have been asked again to take cognizance and give their information to the ministry
 isaki antim tithi 30 november 2016 he
 If he fails to do so, the ministry will consider continuing the recognition of such nsfs in 2017

 ' Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu said on Monday that he would continue his efforts for a non-bjp alliance till May 23, the day of counting of votes
 naidu ne yah bhi kaha ki ve apni is ladaai ko ek tarksangat nishkarsh tak pahunchaayenge
 Keep in mind that this is the same Chandrababu Naidu who was the first NDA convenor at the time of late BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but times have changed and his relationship with NDA is no longer the same
 bijepi ke virodh main khadi partiyon ko ekajute karne kii koshish unki kaaphi dinon se jari hai
 However, in the recent few days, there has been a sharp rise
 khaskar agsit pole ke survey aane ke baad unhone apni is raftaar or badha diya
 Naidu has met several opposition leaders including United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav
 naidu ke abhiyaan main teji kyon?uparokt sawaal kaa jawaab ravivaar ko aae agsit pole ke nateezon main chipa he
 Assembly elections have been held along with Lok Sabha in Andhra Pradesh, but the problem is that most exit polls have given 12-15 seats to Jagan Mohan Reddy's YSRCP and 10-13 to Naidu's party TDP
 adhiktar agsit pols ne anumaan jataayaa ki endie 300 ke kareeb siten jitkar sarkaar banaaegi
 Since Naidu has openly resented his enmity with the NDA, 300 seats of the NDA have been troubling him from Andhra Pradesh to Delhi
 aise main unke saamne doosraa koi vikalp nahin bachataa ki ve vipakshi dalon ke saath ek saajha gathjod banaaen or apni upyogita banaae rakhen
 For this, he can be seen saying that 'andhra Pradesh will undoubtedly form a TDP government and we are confident that non-bjp parties will form a non-bjp government at the Center
 ' agsit pole ke mutabik naidu kii siton main maamuli kami aa sakati he lekin iskaa doosraa pahalu ye he ki wiesar congress kii siton main baari ijapha ho saktaa he
 Because of this Chandrababu Naidu is seen battling on two fronts simultaneously
 ek loksabhaa main or doosraa andhra kii vidhansabha main
 The potential loss of both the places seems to be forcing them to pull into the opposition camp
 sabhi vipakshi netaaon se naidu ke samparkwipakshi dalon kaa shaayad hi koi netaa ho jisase chandrababu naidu haal philhal main na mili hon
 He met SP President Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati on Saturday
 sapa karyaalay main unke or akhilesh yadav ke bich kareeb 70 minute tak baatcheet chali
 Naidu then reached Mayawati's residence on Mall Avenue
 bispi ke varisht netaa satish chandra mishra bhi vahaan maujuud the
 Mayawati welcomed Naidu with a bouquet
 mayawati ke saath unki mulaakaat ek ghanta se adhik samay tak chali
 Although the outcome of the conversation was not known yet
 shanivaar subah unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se unke awaas par mulaakaat kii or phir rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) adhyaksh sharad pavaar or loktantric janata dal ke netaa sharad yadav se sambhavit gathbandhanon ke bare main charchaa karne ke liye mili
 He met Marxist Communist Party leader Sitaram Yechury, Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal on Friday to discuss the possibility of an alliance after the election results were out
 aise vipakshi netaaon ke saath baatcheet kar, jo ek-duusare ke saath sahaj nahin hai, naidu spasht rup se ek madhyasth ban gaye hai
 NDA Convener has been the NDA Convenor, Chandra Babu Naidu was the first NDA convenor at the time of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 endie ke sabase kaddavar sahyogiyon main unka naam shaamil tha lekin andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ko lekar bijepi se unki anban ho gai
 On one hand, the BJP claims that Andhra Pradesh was promised a special package in lieu of a special state and that Andhra Pradesh was given a lot of budget on this head
 jabaki naidu ise bijepi sarkaar kaa kora jhooth bataate rahe hai
 Naidu also went on a hunger strike in Delhi on the demand of Andhra Pradesh and tried to put pressure on the BJP
 dhire-dhire donon partiyon main talkhi badhati gai or natijatan tidipi ne sabase pehle modi sarkaar se apane mantri hataae or baad main endie se bhi alag ho gai
 With the coming of the Lok Sabha elections, the enmity between the two parties increased considerably and went out in a fierce election campaign against each other
 naidu yaheen tak nahin ruke or unhone bijepi virdohi gathbandhan banane ke liye un sabhi dalon se sahyog maanga jo bijepi ke kattar virdohi rahe hai
 Naidu's efforts are still on
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki 23 may ko nattejey aane ke baad kya koi bijepi virdohi morcha banataa he yaa modi sarkaar phir centre kii satta par kabiz hoti he
 The election result will clear the way for Naidu's future politics
 china main do purv up meyaron ko bhrashtachar kaa doshi tehraae jane ke baad faansee de di gai
 The Supreme People's Court of China reported that the hanging was granted after reviewing the cases of both
 sarkari samachar agency shinhua ke anusaar, jhesiyang praant ke hangazou ke purv upmer shu meiyong ko rishwat lene, dhan kii herapheri karne or pad kaa durupyog karne kaa doshi tehraaya gaya tha
 He was sentenced to death on 12 May

 lukose ke haal ke bayaan ke bare main puche jane par purv pradhan nyaayadhish ne kaha ki unke rishtedaaron ke khilaaf yah gambhir aarope he jo aadharahin he
 Commenting for the first time about the top official of income tax, the chairman of the National Human Rights Commission said that his statement is false
 unhone kaha ki na to mere paas or na hi mere rishtedaaron ke paas ek bhi paisa kaala dhan he
 They said that i do not have black money
 mere yaa mere rishtedaaron ke paas se bhi kaala dhan nahin mila he
 He said that he had no objection to disclosing income tax returns between 2005 and 2010

 chir pratidwandi bharat or pakistan kaa pichley kaaphi samay se cricket kii pich par dwipaksheeya siries main aamanaa-saamana nahin hua he
 The pain of former Pakistani fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar is reflected on this
 shoeb akhtar ne iske liye donon deshon kii raajnneeti ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Akhtar believes that cricketers from India and Pakistan are being denied the chance of historical rivalry between the two countries due to politics
 unhone kaha, ‘‘isamen kisi kii (bisisiai yaa pisibi) galati nahin he, donon board chaahate hai ki shrinkhalaa ho
 If the series happens, it is in his favor
 ’’gauratlab he ki donon deshon ke bich 2007 se koi purna dwipaksheeya shrinkhalaa nahin kheli gai he jisamen 2008 main hue mumbai aatanki hamale kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 a short series was held in India in 2012, but a full-fledged cricketing relationship between the two countries is unlikely to begin soon given the current tussle in diplomatic relations
 samachar agency pitiai ke anusaar, akhtar ne se kaha ki yah behad dukhad he ki seemaa ke donon taraf ke cricketron ko bharat-paak pratidwandvita kaa anubhav karne ke kaaphi maukey nahin mil rahe
 This is the biggest series of the game with the Ashes
 unhone kaha ki cricketron ko apane desh ke liye raaton raat hero banane kaa mauka nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Pakistani cricketers get a lot of love in India, i also got a lot of love from India
 ’’shoeb ne kaha ki main chahta hum ki pakistan ke maujuuda cricketer us pyaar kaa anubhav karen jo hamen bharat main mila or apni pratibha dikhaaen
 "akhtar considers himself lucky to have been part of the indo-pak rivalry many times
 is dauraan unhone maukon kaa phayda bhi uthaaya or 1999 main kolkata main asian test championships ke dauraan rahul dravid or sachin tendulkar ko lagaataar gendon par out karke raaton raat star ban gaye
 Akhtar, popularly known as Rawalpindi Express, said that there should be indo-pak cricket, but if it is not happening then people should go ahead and refrain from making statements
 unhone bataaya ki mujhe lagata he ki dwipaksheeya shrinkhalaa tab tak nahin hogi jab tak donon deshon ke bich dwipaksheeya baatcheet shuru nahin hoti
 And in the current situation no one knows whether cricket diplomacy will work or not
 akhtar ne kaha ki maujuuda sthiti ke liye donon board main se kisi ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa

 Saif Ali Khan, while talking to the media that after the release of Phantom, the people there have started considering him as anti-pakistan
 darasal, pichley shuukravaar ko release hui saif kii film phantum main aatankwaad kaa mudda uthaaya gaya he, jisamen saif aatankwaad ke kilaaf ladate nazar aae
 The film also included Hafiz Saeed's speech, due to which the Phantom was not allowed to be released in Pakistan
 tippaniyan Saif said that after the release of Phantom, i have become the face of anti-pakistan, which i am not
 dilon ko logon ko kuch raajnneeti ne baanta he
 i can never think of sharing hearts
 main ek abhinayta hum, jo alag-alag bhoomikaayen nibhaataa he or main yahi karata hum
 For me, this is the only role played on screen
 ' Before Saif, the people of Pakistan have been hating on Sunny Deol a little, because in the film Ghadar, Sunny hit the Pakistanis on the screen by uprooting the hand pump
 uske alaava film indian ho yaa da hero, yaa phir film border, aisi kai filmon main sani deol parade par kabhi pakistan se bheje gaye aatankwaad se lade to kabhi pakistan kii fuj ko unhone dhul chataayee
 In fact, the issue of terrorism has been raised in Saif's film Phantom, released last Friday, in which Saif was seen fighting against terrorism
 is film main haafiz said kaa bhaashan bhi shaamil kiya gaya he, jisaki vajah se phantum ko pakistan main release nahin hone diya gaya
 The comments saif ne kaha ki 'phantum kii release ke baad main pakistan virodh kaa main cheharaa ban gaya hum, jo main nahin hum
 Some politics has divided the hearts of the people
 main kabhi bhi dilon ko baantne kii nahin soch saktaa
 i am an actor who plays different roles and this is what i do
 mere liye ye keval ek bhoomika he, jo parade par nibhaai gai he
 ' saif se pehle pakistan ke log sani deol se thodi nafrat karte aae hai, kyonki film gadar main sani ne had hand pump ukhadkar pakistaniyon ko parade par maaraa tha
 Apart from that, in many such films like Indian or The Hero, or Film Border, Sunny Deol on the screen sometimes fought with terrorism sent from Pakistan and sometimes Pakistan army lost his dust

 ) Couples are often estranged about money after marriage
 shaadi karne vaale do logon kaa najariya paison ko lekar alag-alag ho saktaa he
 It depends to a great extent on how they were raised or under what circumstances they grew up
 yah antar hi aage chalakar zyaadaatar rishton main tanaav, jhagade or chintaa kii vajah paise ke masale hi hote hai
 In such a situation, it is better that financial issues should be discussed openly before marriage
 yah lav marij or arenjd marij, donon hi maamalon main jaruri he
 If you have not known your life partner for a long time, then you may be a little uncomfortable to ask questions related to money
 lekin baat aapke bhavishya kii he or yah bhi sahi he ki paison ko lekar hone vaali thodi anban bhi ap donon ke bich bada masalaa ban sakati he
 Therefore, these 5 questions related to money must be asked before yes for marriage
 sichuation ko thodaa sahaj karne ke liye aap ek-ek karke bhi in muddon par baat kar sakate hai :1) aapke parents ne paison ke maamle main bachapan se kitni chhot di hsapane partner se jaanane kii koshish karen ki unke ghar main paise ko lekar kya najariya he or ve bachat ko kitni ahmiyat dete hai
 Ask them how studies, long vacations and big expenses were managed
 paise ko lekar kya unke parents ne koi badi galati kii he? kya ve vittiya rup se ghar ke bujurgon kaa dhyaan de rahe hai
 The answers to all these questions will help both of you to understand each other's financial background
 2) lone or hobbi ko kariyar banane ke bare main karen sawalpaison se judi kuch jimmedaariyaan ham sabhi par jarur hoti he
 For example, if the parents have taken a loan for your studies, then they have to repay you
 ho saktaa he kiunhone apane ritairement ke paise se yah rakam di ho
 Apart from this, if you are dreaming of leaving your job and making any of your passion a profession, then it is important to discuss this also
 3) kharch karte samay kya card kii limit check karte hancouples ke bich kharch karne se judi aadaten baad main kalah kii badi vajah ban jaati hai
 So many questions like - how much do you spend on credit card, do you spend more than your limit
 kya aapane dost yabank se udhaar yaa lone par le rakhaa he
 You only save or invest somewhere else
 unase yah sab jaanane ke baad apni aadaton se isaki tulana karen or phir dekhen ki aap donon ek trek par chal sakenge yaa nahin
 4) Talk about future planning related to money, buying a talk house, children's planning, retirement and emergency fund - openly talk to your life partner on these four issues
 iske saath hi shaadi ke baad bhi agar padhai karne kaa koi vichaar ho to pehle hi apni ichha jaahir kar den
 Also try to know what is his priority, save money for big car or children's education
 nivesh kii planning ke bare main bhi jarur puuchhie
 You may not understand anything at all, but you will definitely succeed in understanding its behavior and thinking
 5) shaadi or honeymoon ke kharch kaa bhi len jayjupane partner ko khul kar bataaen ki aap shaadi main hone vaale kharchon par kya sochate hai
 If you are thinking of spending a large part of your savings in it, then definitely tell him this
 shaadi se judi zyaadaatar dikkateneemaandaaree se jawaab or khuli baatcheetse hi sulajh jaati hai
 So feel free to tell your partner about your desire and scope related to money
 supreme court kii sakhti ke baavjood hindustan main mob linching kii ghatnaayen thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi hai

 kanoon vyavastha ko behaal rakhana rajya sarkaar kii jimmedaari he or prayek rajya sarkaar ko ye jimmedaari nibhaani hogi
 Crowd violence is a serious crime
