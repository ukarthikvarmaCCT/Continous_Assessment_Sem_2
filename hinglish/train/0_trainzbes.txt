 Issues
 22 july kii dopaher 2
 Chandrayaan-2 will be launched at 52 minutes, was stopped just before the launching on 15 July
 Helium leakage in the Chandrayaan-2 cryogenic stage was done right after the launch of the second moon mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) Chandrayaan-2 on 15 July
 56 from launch
 24 minute pehle roak di gai
 2 in the early hours of Chandrayaan-2
 51 baje desh ke sabase taqatvar bahubali rocket GSLV-MK3 se launch kiya janaa tha
 But 56
 24 minute pehle countdown roak diya gaya
 ISRO spokesperson BR Guruprasad, while making a statement on behalf of ISRO, said that the launch has been halted due to a flaw in the GSLV-MK3 launch vehicle (rocket)
 lonching kii agali taarikh jald hi ghoshit kii jaaegi
 But, after this, ISRO scientists discovered that flaw and corrected it
 isro ke vishwast sutron ne bataaya he ki cryogenic stage ke cmand gas bottle main pressure licage tha
 It was filled with helium
 yah cryogenic ingine main bhare liquid oxigen or liquid hydrogen ko thanda rakhane kaa kaam karata he
 The mission had to be stopped due to helium leakage
 bottle main helium kaa pressure level nahin ban rahaa tha
 It was reduced from 330 points to 300, then to 280 and finally to 160
 isliye launch ko rokna padaa
 Launching could not be done in four days, then will be postponed for 3 months Chandrayaan-215 What have you done after July so far
 ISRO scientists first extracted propellant (fuel) from all stages of Bahubali GSLV-MK3 rocket
 isro vaigyanikon kii yojana thi ki puure jieselvi-emke 3 ko alag-alag kiya jayega, lekin aisa karne kii jarurat nahin padi
 It has been corrected by removing only the part which was missing
 isro vaigyanikon ne helium gas bottle ko badal diya he
 Also fixed the valve from which the pressure was leaking
 aaj se agle kuch din kya karenge isro vaigyanikaj yani 18 july ko dinabhar test karne ke baad shaam ko isro kii analysis cameti saare test ke parinaamon kii jaanch karegaa
 Also, the parts of the GSLV-MK3 rocket from which fuel was extracted
 iske baad rocket ke sabhi hisson kii essembling unit main le jaakar dobaaraa essembling kii jaaegi
 It will then be moved to Launchpad-2
 iske baad launch se kuch ghante pehle rocket ke vibhinn hisson main eendhan bharaa jayega
 There is also a possibility that ISRO scientists reduce the 5 rounds of Chandrayaan-2 around the earth to 4 after launching
 haalanki isamen eendhan thodaa zyada kharch hoga
 Reducing the Earth's orbit will save time for further travel
 abhi chand kii duuri thodi zyada ho gai he to aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki chand par pahunchane ke baad bhi vaigyanik chand ke chaaron taraf lagaae jane vaale chakkaron ko bhi kam kar sakate hai
 a good thing that ISRO postponed
 
 
 varanaa antariksh main kho saktaa tha Chandrayaan-222 july kii dopaher ho sakati he chandrayan-2 kii lonchingisro ke vishwast sutron ne bataaya he ki isro vaigyanikon ne helium licage kii samasya ko thik kar diya he
 There are some tests left which will be completed by 18 July
 22 july ko dopaher 2
 Chandrayaan-2 can be launched at 52 pm
 aise main bharat ke moon mishan chandrayan-2 kii yatra 4 din aage bad jaaegi
 That is, first Chandrayaan-2 was supposed to reach the moon on 6 September, but if it is launched on 22, then it will reach the south pole of the moon on 11 or 12 September
 haalanki, july ant tak lonching kii puri sambhaavna he
 If it is not launched this month, it can be launched in September
 agar 22 july ko launch nahin hua to sitambar-oktober main hogi lonchindgar vaigyanikon ke puraa prayaas karne ke baad bhi 22 july ko launch nahin kar pate to agle kuch hafte chandrayan kii lonching sambhav nahin he
 Because, this launch window will end
 aglaa launch windo sitambar yaa oktober main aayega
 The launch window is the appropriate time when the moon's distance from Earth is short and the probability of hitting satellites and space wastes around the Earth is extremely low
 chand abhi dur he
 
 
 This is the reason behind postponing the launch of Chandrayaan-2 at the last moment, the reason why the Moon mission's launching launch window will be decided in september-october, isro's Space Physics Lab at Trivandrum
 aglaa launch windo sitambar yaa oktober main milegaa
 Because during this time the distance of the moon from the Earth averaged 3
 61 lakh kimi hoti he
 If the launch of Chandrayaan-2 was successful on July 15, it would be around 3
 84 lakh kimi kii yatra kerani padati
 That is, about 23 thousand km more distance had to be traveled
 centre sarkaar ne reliance industries ke khilaaf kadaa kadam uthaate hue us par kareeb 6600 karod rupye kaa jurmaana lagaaya he
 The penalty was imposed on Reliance Industries for its sharp decline in production from its KG-D6 gas block
 is kadam ke baad petroleum mantralay or aariel ke bich vivaad or gaharaa gaya he
 The notice which the Petroleum Ministry sent to the company said that the company has violated the Production Sharing Contract (PSC)
 company ne manjuuri mili plan main jitne kuen khodne kaa vaada kiya tha, jaan-boojhkar usase kam kuen khode gaye
 Significantly, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Petroleum and Natural Gas had suggested to the Ministry of Petroleum and the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) to keep a close watch on the gas sector
 utpaadan main kisi tarah kii kami ke liye bhi mukesh ambani kii aguai vaali reliance se puraa hisaab-kitaab lene ko kaha gaya tha
 Job is the 30th issue of the series
 netaa or noujvaan aamane saamne hai
 The leader chooses his platform and gives a speech on the youth, when the young man chooses his field, there is no leader among them
 is desh main aadmi kaa number ban gaya he magar kitni naukari milti he, kitnon kii jaati he, iskaa koi thos aankada nahin he
 That is why leaders talk about talking bharat main berojgaare badhati ja rahi he or berojgaare par hi baat nahin ho rahi he
 Election is about to come and to fool the youth, it is being announced that 3-4 lakhs will be reinstated
 ho yah rahaa tha ki sarkaron ne naukariyaan deni band kar di thim yaa kam kar di thim, ab sarkaron ke paas teen se chaar lakh bhartee karne kaa dhaancha hi nahin he
 Therefore, the announcement of the restoration of four lakhs is the first news but no one knows when the restoration will take place
 railway main hi jo bhartee nikalati he use puraa hone main ausatan 2 se 4 saal lag jate hai
 We have seen under the job series that no examination is completed before two to three years
 sabko bich raste main idhar udhar bhatka diya jaataa he
 Therefore the young man is upset
 wo kab tak bardaasht karegaa
 Every type of speech has been heard, but there is no change in the examination system
 aane vaale maheenon main chaar se paanch lakh bhartee vaali khabaron kii hedline aapako khub milegi magar naukari milte milte hedline gaayab ho chuki hogi
 So be cautious, question whether if you complete the restoration process within six months, we will clap or else you will be questioned
 hedline management se berojgaare dur nahin hoti he na slogan main swarg hota he
 You remove any episode of the job series and watch ndtv
 in par naukari series ke tison ank mil jaaenge
 Same place at the same time
 mangalvaar 20 march ko mumbai ke central railway line par hazaron kii sankhya main railway aprintis aa dhamke
 The movement stopped at this track for three and a half hours
 iske kaaran mumbai ke yatriyon ko kaaphi takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 You cannot make a path for yourself by stopping someone, so it would be good that there is no movement on the rail tracks
 aap ye na samajhen ki ye sabhi mumbai yaa maharashtra ke hai
 The youth from Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat also went to Mumbai for this movement
 12 march ko inhone ol india railway zone ke mahaprabandhak ko patr likhaa tha ki ve chaahate hai ki railway jinhen training detii he unhen pehle kii tarah training ke baad naukari par rakh le
 It has happened that in June last year, the Railways made a policy that only 20 percent seats will be reserved for its apprentices, the rest will have to face open competition
 noujvaan chaahate hai ki ek to aprintins kii bahaali kam ho gai he, ve training ke baad se is intazaar main the ki railway kaam par rakhegi kyonki inhen to training mili hui he, agle din se kaam karne lagenge
 After three hours, when they received written assurance that the decision would be taken after two days, they ended the picket
 police ne in par lathi charge kiya or inaki taraf se bhi pathar chale
 Isn't it logical that the railways, who have been given training for one to three years, have selected them from the competitive examination for training, then the railways should also give them work because they have got training to make the railway wheel , They cannot even open their shop outside
 kya aapako is baat main dam nahin lagata he
 You know that there are 2 lakh 20 thousand vacancies in the Railways, the Ministry has told the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways that there is no intention to fill all the posts
 kuch padon ko outsource kiye jane par bhi vichaar chal rahaa he
 If all the posts are filled then they can be adjusted within 20 thousand hours
 hamaare sahyogi sunil kumaar singh or sohit mishra mangalvaar kii ghatana ko cover kar rahe the
 It is not that the government was not aware of their performance
 12 march ko railway aprintis ne karnataka kii rajdhani bengalooru main bijepi offis ke saamne dharna diya tha or yediurppa bhi inase milane aae the
 Said they will talk to the Railway Minister
 naujavaanon ne yediurppa ke aashwaasan par dharna samaapt kar diya
 But if nothing happens after that, they have sat on a dharna outside the railway's DMM office in the same city since 19 March
 inkaa daawa he ki 2000 se adhik noujvaan vahaan ke dharne main shaamil ho chuke hai
 By the way, they cite 20,000 unemployed apprentices across India
 zyaadaatar 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 ke paas out hai
 Meanwhile, in the year of 2016, 699 in Mumbai and 45 in Gorakhpur and 13 Apprentices have been kept in Northern Railway but the rest are unemployed
 yediurppa ne jab aashwaasan diya or in naujavaanon ne ol india railway zone ke mahaprabandhan ko soochna de di tab bhi inaki maang par sunwaayee nahin hui
 In fact, when the youth agitate, the governments wonder who will cover them
 do din hangaamaa karenge or phir media kisi saansad ke sampradayik bayaan ko lekar vyast ho jayega
 Surely these youth should not have stopped the train but should not anyone have listened to them? pichley agast ye railway aprintis dilli aae the
 Between 10 August and 21 August, Jantar gathered at Mantar
 inaki jeb main paise nahin the
 The condition worsened
 kuch to pehle do teen din main hi biimaar ho gaye
 Later, arrangements were made to drink their food from Gurdwara Rakabganj, then they stayed on the movement
 tabhi main inke bich gaya tha or samajhane kaa prayaas kiya tha ki ye kya maamla he
 All of them came in black clothes so that according to the coverage of the media, a visual element could also be made, but no media came
 kya aap ek naagarik ke taur par iskaa hisaab rakhana chahenge ki vot dene ke baad jab sarkaar ke saamne janata awaz uthaati he to vah sarkaar unki awaz sunati he yaa nahin
 Before August 2017, they had also agitated on January 30-31 2017
 usase bhi pehle disambar 2016 main andolan kar chuke the
 You tell me, the railway from which you have taken training, the same railway should not give a job, and when you ask any question, should it be so
 hamane jab pichley saal dikhaaya tha tab inhen yakeen nahin hua tha ki prime time main koi dikhaa saktaa he
 Today, when our colleague Sunil Kumar Singh went to talk to them, the youth became emotional
 dekhie agar media samaaj ke khilaaf ho jaataa he to aadmi kitna asahaay ho jaataa he
 Today's dock media has turned against the public
 aap jaanate hai ki railway ne is saal kareeb 90,000 bhartiyon nikaali hai
 But you do not know whether there is a structure to fulfill these recruitments or not, and in how many years these recruitments will be completed
 kya aap yah bhi jaanate hai ki railway ke paas 2 lakh 20 hazaar se adhik vekency he
 But the Railways has told the standing committee of Parliament that it is not its intention to fill all the posts
 baaki padon ko outsource yani theke par bhare jane kaa vikalp dekha ja rahaa he
 Today even if the railways announces the reinstatement of all 2 lakh 20 thousand posts, even then it cannot complete this recruitment before two to three years
 rail mantri kehete hai ki 20 pratishat reserve rakhane kii niti supreme court ke aadesh ke baad bani he lekin aprintins kehete hai ki railway kii apni banaai hui niti he
 Now we have no opinion on this because i do not have the facts
 bas ek patr he
 At this time, there is no big news in India except unemployment, jobs, and poor state of examination system
 agar ye khabar pehle panne par nahin he to yuvaaon ko akhbaar padhanaa chhod dena chahie
 Must stop watching TV
 aap sochie agra ke biaar ambedkar uniwarsity ke chaatro par kya biit rahi hogi, riselt nahin aayaa he lihaaza jo bhartee nikali he uske liye applai bhi nahin kar sakate
 They will also see how much Hindu Muslim debate
 din bhar agra se hataash maayoos chaatro kaa phone aa rahaa he ki hamaara riselt nikalava dijie
 Would you like your children to be punished and punished? ham ek sipaahi kaa imtahaan nahin kara paa rahe hai, bina chori or dhaandhlee ke
 On March 20, the Rajasthan Police Recruitment Exam was completely canceled
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 18 oktober 2017 ko 5500 sipaahiyon kii bhartee ke liye vigyaapan nikaala tha
 There was a fee of Rs 400 for general students, Rs 300 for scheduled castes and tribes
 itnaa paisa dekar chaar maheene baad jab march 2018 main imtahaan hota he to vah nakal ke kaaran radd ho jaati he
 Similarly, the headline is made at the time of every exam, and after the cancellation, the headline disappears gradually
 yuvaaon kaa kitna samay barbaad hua he
 Rajasthan Patrika has written that 16 lakh candidates are going to be affected
 15 march ke bhaskar main khabar chhapi he ki mukhyamantri ne tay kiya he ki is saal disbanr tak sari bhartee puri ho jaaegi
 You see how much recruitment is completed
 jab ham 5500 padon par bahaali samay se bina chori ke nahin kara sakate to kya 90,000 yaa 1 lakh padon kii bahaali bina teen chaar saal ke ho sakati he
 At times, it seems that governments leave such laxity that the case is canceled, and if not canceled, then it gets stuck in the case
 ieneldi ke saansad dushyant chautaala ne shram mantri se sawaal poocha he ki pichley teen saal main berojgaare kii vruddhi dar kya he, us dauraan naukari dene kaa kya lakshya tha, usamen kitni safalataa praapt hui he
 So the answer is that no target has been set by the government
 tathaapi, rojgaar srijan evam niyojaneeyata main sudhaar karnaa sarkaar kii pramukh praathamikta rahi he
 Many policies have been counted with this answer, from Mudra Yojana to Skill India
 magar unke kaaran kitnon ko rojgaar mila iskaa koi aankada nahin diya gaya he
 Whether the government does not have figures to tell or it does not have figures at all
 ye to agle chunaav ke slogan se hi pataa chalegaa
 These boys have visited Mumbai many times from different cities of Maharashtra
 19 march ko enditivi mumbai ke daftar pahunch gaye
 Then came also on 20 March
 ye bachche dilli aakar prime time ke liye apni kahani bataanaa chaahate the magar inke paas dilli aane tak ke liye paise nahin the isliye ye mumbai sthit hamaare daftar gaye
 Around 450 students are waiting for their appointment with Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited Mahagenco
 2014 main dipti eczecutive ejeeniyar ke 212 pad kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha, jiske liye 17000 chaatro ne applai kar diya
 The form was filled by giving 500 rupees
 11 janvari 2015 main likhit pariksha lee gai
 Result came on 20 March 2015
 450 log paas hue
 When he felt that he would get a government job, he quit his old job
 koi bhi chhod degaa kyonki sarkari naukari jo mili thi
 But a student filed a case on 4 June 2016
 in chaatro ne cese karne vaale chaatr se sampark kiya, use samajhaayaa ki sarkaar to sirf date lekar chali jaati he, mukadmaa to ladati nahin he or tumhaare chalate hamaara jivan barbaad ho gaya to us ladke ne julai 2017 main cese waapas le liya
 Now all the obstacles of their joining had gone away
 lekin uske baad saat maheene se zyaada samay ho chuke hai magar inaki jwining nahin hui he
 The decision of the court has come in their favor, even after this, there is no joining
 iskaa koi hisaab he ki saat maheene se ye jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai, yahaan vahaan bhatak rahe hai, awwal aapane duniya main kahi suna he ki sab kuch clear ho jane ke baad saat saat maheene tak jwining nahin ho rahi he
 The same is the position of the Staff Selection Commission
 abhi bhi hazaron chaatro ko agast 2017 main pariksha paas karne ke baad jwining letters nahin mila he
 Around a thousand students are waiting for the joining letter for the CAG assistant auditor
 in bacchon ke saath ye ninsaphi bardaasht kaise kii ja sakati he
 Outside the Staff Selection Commission, students have made a big agitation for rigging several times in examinations
 sansad kii sthai samiti kii report bhi ai he
 This report states that there are 2,220 court cases on the Staff Selection Commission
 to sawaal aata he ki court main cese kii sunwaayee tej gati se ho iskaa prayaas hona chahie kyonki isse naujavaanon kii zindagi barbaad ho rahi he
 The simple thing is, then if you listen to the vacancy of the judges, then today you will not be able to eat food, not only that something is happening other than slogan
 tippaniyan The report of the parliamentary committee says that in ten years, the responsibility of SSC has been taken to take the examination of more than twenty times the students
 2008-09 ke dauraan esayssi ke imtahaanon main kareeb das lakh chaatro ne hissaa liya tha
 In 2016-17, the number of students in SSC examinations increased to 2 crore
 lekin itani badi sankhya main chaatro ko sanbhaalane ke liye karmchaariyon kii sankhya jas kii tas he
 For ten years, the number of sanctioned posts of Commission staff has been stuck at 481 only
 isamen se bhi is vakt 115 pad khaali hai yani 24 pratishat pad khaali hai
 This commission does not fill the staff within its time
 do karod chaatr esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil hote hai
 Due to this, the lives of two crore students are affected, but the problems of its students did not get media coverage
 naukari series or inke apane andolan ke kaaran aaj aap esayssi ke bare main jaanate hai magar aap dekhie ki berojgaare badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne hi sara intazaam kiya hua he
 If it is not discussed then how will it change
 kab badalegaa
 In the coming months, you will get a lot of headline of four to five lakh recruitment news, but the headline will have disappeared after getting a job
 isliye satark rahen, sawaal ye karen ki kya aap chah maheene ke bheetar bahaali kii prakriya puri karenge to ham tali bajaaenge varna aapse sawaal karenge
 Unemployment is not overcome by headline management, nor is slogan in heaven
 aap naukari series kaa koi bhi episod nikaal kar dekh lijie ndtv
 You will get thirty points of job series on in
 ek hi jagah ek hi saath
 On Tuesday, 20 March, thousands of railway apprentices arrived on the Central Railway line of Mumbai
 saadhe teen ghante tak is trek par awajahi ruk gai
 Due to this, the passengers of Mumbai suffered a lot
 kisi ko roak kar aap apane liye rasta nahin bana sakate isliye acha hota is tarah se rail kii patari par andolan nahin hota
 Do not assume that all of them are from Mumbai or Maharashtra
 is andolan ke punjab, uttar pradesh, bihar or gujarat se bhi noujvaan mumbai gaye the
 On March 12, he wrote a letter to the General Manager of the All India Railway Zone that he wanted the railways to train them to be hired after training as before
 hua yah he ki pichley saal june me railway ne niti banaai ki apane aprintis ke liye 20 pratishat hi seat reserve rahegi, baaki ko khuli pratiyogita kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 The youth want that once the restoration of the apprentices has come down, they have been waiting since the training that the railways will be hired because they have got training, they will start working from the next day
 teen ghante ke baad jab likhit aashwaasan mila ki do dinon baad faisla liya jayega tab inhone dharna samaapt kiya
 The police charged lathi on them and stones also came from their side
 kya yah baat tarksangat nahin he ki railway ne jinhen ek se teen saal kii training di he, training ke liye pratiyogita pariksha se hi inkaa chunaav kiya he, to railway ko inhen kaam bhi dena chahie kyonki inhen training to rail kaa pahiyaa banane kii mili he, ye baahar apni dukaan bhi nahin khol sakate hai
 Do you feel sorry for this? aap jaanate hai ki railway main 2 lakh 20 hazaar pad khaali hai, mantralay ne railway par sansad kii sthai samiti se kaha he ki saare padon ko bharne kaa iraadaa nahin he
 Some positions are being considered outsourced as well
 agar saare pad bhare jane lage to ye 20 hazaar bhi ghante bhar main edjust ho sakate hai
 Our partners Sunil Kumar Singh and Sohit Mishra were covering the Tuesday event
 aisa nahin he ki sarkaar ko inke pradarshan kii jaankaree nahin thi
 On March 12, the Railway Apprentice staged a sit-in in front of the BJP office in Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, and Yeddyurappa also came to meet them
 kaha ki ve rail mantri se baat karenge
 The youth ended the picket on Yeddyurappa's assurance
 magar uske baad kuch nahin hua to ve 19 march se usee shahar main railway ke daaarem ke daftar ke baahar dharne par baith gaye hai
 They claim that more than 2000 youth have joined the dharna
 vaise ve bharat bhar main berojgaar aprintis kii sankhya 20,000 bataate hai
 Most 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 passes are out
 is bich 2016 ke saal main mumbai main 699 or gorakhpur main 45 or nardan railway main 13 aprintins rakhe gaye hai magar baaki berojgaar gum rahe hai
 When Yeddyurappa gave the assurance and these youth gave information to the General Manager of All India Railway Zone, even then their demand was not heard
 darasal noujvaan jab andolan karte hai to sarkarein sochati hai ki inhen koun cover karegaa
 There will be a commotion for two days and then the media will get busy with communal statements of an MP
 zarur in naujavaanon ko rail nahin rokani chahie thi lekin kya inaki baat kisi ko sunani nahin chahie thi? Last August, the Railway Apprentice came to Delhi
 10 agast se 21 agast ke bich jantar mantar par jamaa hue
 There was no money in his pocket
 haalat kharaab ho gai
 Some became ill within the first two-three days
 baad main gurudwara rakabganj kii taraf se inke khaane pine kaa intazaam karaayaa gaya tab jaakar ye andolan par date rahe
 Then i went among them and tried to understand what was the matter
 ye sabhi kaale kapade main aae the taaki media ke kawarej ke hisaab se vijual element bhi ban saken magar koi media nahin aayaa
 Would you, as a citizen, want to keep an account of whether the government listens to their voice when the public raises their voice in front of the government after voting
 agast 2017 se pehle ye janvari 30-31 2017 ko bhi andolan kar chuke the
 They had agitated in December 2016 even before that
 aap hi bataaiye, jis railway se training lee ho, vahi railway naukari na de, or jab sawaal kare to kisi ko fark na pade, kya aisa hona chahie
 When we showed last year, he was not sure that anyone could show in prime time
 aaj sab hamaare sahyogi sunil kumaar singh inase baat karne gaye to noujvaan bhavuk ho gaye
 See if the media turns against the society then how disillusioned the man becomes
 aaj kaa godi media janata ke khilaaf ho gaya he
 You know that the Railways has removed about 90,000 recruits this year
 magar aap yah nahin jaanate ki in bhartiyon ko puraa karne kaa dhaancha he bhi yaa nahin or kitne saal main ye bhartiyon puri hongi
 Do you also know that the railway has more than 2 lakh 20 thousand vacancies
 magar railway ne sansad kii sthai samiti se kaha he ki uskaa iraadaa sabhi padon ko bharne kaa nahin he
 The option of outsourcing the remaining positions is being seen
 aaj agar railway sabhi 2 lakh 20 hazaar padon kii bahaali kaa elaan bhi kar de to bhi vah do teen saal se pehle is bharti ko puri nahin kar sakati he
 The Railway Minister says that the policy of keeping 20 percent reserve has been formed after the order of the Supreme Court, but the apprentices say that the Railways have their own policy
 ab is par hamaari koi raay nahin kyonki mere paas tathy nahin hai
 Just a letter
 is vakt bharat main berojgaare, naukari, pariksha pranali kii jarjar haalat ke alaava koi badi khabar nahin he
 If this news is not on the front page, then the youth should stop reading the newspaper
 tivi dekhnaa band kar dena chahie
 Think about what will happen to the students of BR Ambedkar University in Agra, the results have not come, so you cannot apply for the recruitment that has come out
 ve bhi kitna hindu muslim dibet dekhenge
 Throughout the day, there is a call from desperate students from Agra to get our results out
 kya aap chahenge ki aapke bacchon ko bhi yahi sazaa mili or kis baat kii sazaa mili
 We are not able to test a soldier without stealing and rigging
 20 march ko hi rajasthan me sipaahi bhartee pariksha puri tarah nirast kar di gai
 The Rajasthan government on 18 October 2017 had advertised for the recruitment of 5500 soldiers
 saamaanya chaatro ke liye 400, anusuchit jati or janajati ke liye 300 rupye kii fees thi
 After four months, when the examination takes place in March 2018, it gets canceled due to copying
 isi tarah har pariksha nikalne ke vakt hedline banati he, radd hone ke vakt hedline banane ke baad dhire-dhire gaayab ho jaati he
 How much time has been wasted by the youth
 rajasthan patrika ne likhaa he ki 16 lakh abhyarthi prabhavit hone ja rahe hai
 The news has appeared in Bhaskar of 15 March that the Chief Minister has decided that all the recruitment will be completed by December this year
 aap dekhte chaliye kitni bhartee puri hoti he
 When we cannot get 5500 posts reinstated without stealing on time, can 90,000 or 1 lakh posts be restored without three to four years
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkarein hi aisi dheel chhod detii hai ki maamla radd hota rahe, radd na ho to mukademe main fansata rahe
 INLD MP Dushyant Chautala has asked the Labor Minister the question of what is the growth rate of unemployment in the last three years, what was the goal of giving jobs during that time, how much success has been achieved in it
 to jawaab diya gaya he ki sarkaar dwaara koi lakshya nahin rakhaa gaya he
 However, improving employment generation and employability has been a major priority of the government
 is jawaab ke saath bahut sari nitiyaan gina di gayi hai, vahi mudra yojana se lekar skill india tak
 But no data has been given on how many people got employment because of them
 kya sarkaar ke paas bataane laayak aankade nahin hai yaa phir aankade he hi nahin
 This will be known only from the slogan of the next election
 maharashtra ke alag alag shaharon se ye ladke kai baar mumbai kaa chakkar laga chuke hai
 NDTV reached Mumbai's office on 19 March
 phir 20 march ko bhi aae
 These children wanted to come to Delhi and tell their story for prime time but they did not have money to come to Delhi so they went to our office in Mumbai
 kareeb 450 kii sankhya main ye chaatr maharashtra state power janareshan company limited mahajenko main apni niyukti kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 In 2014, 212 posts of deputy executive engineers were advertised, for which 17000 students applied
 500 rupee dekar farm bharaa tha
 Written test was taken on 11 January 2015
 20 march 2015 ko riselt aayaa
 450 people passed
 jab laga ki sarkari naukari mil jaaegi to inhone puraani naukari chhod di
 No one will leave because the government job they got
 lekin ek chaatr ne 4 june 2016 ko cese kar diya
 These students approached the student who made the case, explained to him that the government only goes on a date, the case is not contested and because of you ruining our life, the boy withdrew the case in July 2017
 ab inaki jwining kii sari adchane dur ho gai thi
 But after that it has been more than seven months but they have not joined
 adaalat kaa nirnay inke paksh main hi aayaa he iske baad bhi jwining nahin hui he
 It is a calculation that for seven months, they have been waiting for joining, wandering here and there, you have heard in the world that everything is not joining for seven months after clearing everything
 staff salection kamishan kaa bhi yahi haal he
 Thousands of students still have not received the joining letter after passing the exam in August 2017
 sieji ke sahaayak auditor ke liye hazaar ke kareeb chaatr jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 How can this injustice be tolerated with these children? staff salection kamishan ke baahar chaatr kai baar pareekshaon main dhaandhlee ko lekar bada andolan kar chuke hai
 The report of the Standing Committee of Parliament has also come
 is report main kaha gaya he ki staff salection kamishan par 2,220 court cese hai
 So the question comes that the trial of the case in the court should be done at a fast pace because it is ruining the lives of the youth
 simpal baat he, phir aap jajon kii vekainsee kaa haal sunenge to aaj khaanaa nahin kha paaenge lagegaa hi nahin ki slogan ke alaava kuch ho bhi rahaa he
 The comments sansadeey samiti kii report main kaha gaya he ki das saal main esayssi ke jimme bees guna se adhik chaatro kii pariksha lene kii zimmedaari aa gai he
 About one million students participated in SSC examinations during 2008-09
 2016-17 main esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil chaatro kii sankhya badhkar 2 karod ho gai
 But the number of employees to handle such a large number of students remains the same
 das saal se ayog ke karmchaariyon kii sweekrut padon kii sankhya 481 par hi ataki he
 Of this, 115 posts are vacant at this time i
e
 24 per cent are vacant
 yah ayog apane bheetar karmchaariyon ko samay se nahin bhar paata he
 Twenty million students attend SSC examinations
 iske kaaran do karod chaatro kii zindagi prabhavit hoti he phir bhi iske chaatro kii samasyaon ko media kawarez nahin miltaa tha
 Today you know about SSC due to job series and their own movement, but you see that the government has made all the arrangements to increase unemployment
 agar is par charchaa nahin hogi to yah kaise badalegaa
 When will it change mangalvaar 20 march ko mumbai ke central railway line par hazaron kii sankhya main railway aprintis aa dhamke
 The movement stopped at this track for three and a half hours
 iske kaaran mumbai ke yatriyon ko kaaphi takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 You cannot make a path for yourself by stopping someone, so it would be good that there is no movement on the rail tracks
 aap ye na samajhen ki ye sabhi mumbai yaa maharashtra ke hai
 The youth from Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat also went to Mumbai for this movement
 12 march ko inhone ol india railway zone ke mahaprabandhak ko patr likhaa tha ki ve chaahate hai ki railway jinhen training detii he unhen pehle kii tarah training ke baad naukari par rakh le
 It has happened that in June last year, the Railways made a policy that only 20 percent seats will be reserved for its apprentices, the rest will have to face open competition
 noujvaan chaahate hai ki ek to aprintins kii bahaali kam ho gai he, ve training ke baad se is intazaar main the ki railway kaam par rakhegi kyonki inhen to training mili hui he, agle din se kaam karne lagenge
 After three hours, when they received written assurance that the decision would be taken after two days, they ended the picket
 police ne in par lathi charge kiya or inaki taraf se bhi pathar chale
 Isn't it logical that the railways, who have been given training for one to three years, have selected them from the competitive examination for training, then the railways should also give them work because they have got training to make the railway wheel , They cannot even open their shop outside
 kya aapako is baat main dam nahin lagata he
 You know that there are 2 lakh 20 thousand vacancies in the Railways, the Ministry has told the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways that there is no intention to fill all the posts
 kuch padon ko outsource kiye jane par bhi vichaar chal rahaa he
 If all the posts are filled then they can be adjusted within 20 thousand hours
 hamaare sahyogi sunil kumaar singh or sohit mishra mangalvaar kii ghatana ko cover kar rahe the
 It is not that the government was not aware of their performance
 12 march ko railway aprintis ne karnataka kii rajdhani bengalooru main bijepi offis ke saamne dharna diya tha or yediurppa bhi inase milane aae the
 Said they will talk to the Railway Minister
 naujavaanon ne yediurppa ke aashwaasan par dharna samaapt kar diya
 But if nothing happens after that, they have sat on a dharna outside the railway's DMM office in the same city since 19 March
 inkaa daawa he ki 2000 se adhik noujvaan vahaan ke dharne main shaamil ho chuke hai
 By the way, they cite 20,000 unemployed apprentices across India
 zyaadaatar 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 ke paas out hai
 Meanwhile, in the year of 2016, 699 in Mumbai and 45 in Gorakhpur and 13 Apprentices have been kept in Northern Railway but the rest are unemployed
 yediurppa ne jab aashwaasan diya or in naujavaanon ne ol india railway zone ke mahaprabandhan ko soochna de di tab bhi inaki maang par sunwaayee nahin hui
 In fact, when the youth agitate, the governments wonder who will cover them
 do din hangaamaa karenge or phir media kisi saansad ke sampradayik bayaan ko lekar vyast ho jayega
 Surely these youth should not have stopped the train but should not anyone have listened to them? pichley agast ye railway aprintis dilli aae the
 Between 10 August and 21 August, Jantar gathered at Mantar
 inaki jeb main paise nahin the
 The condition worsened
 kuch to pehle do teen din main hi biimaar ho gaye
 Later, arrangements were made to drink their food from Gurdwara Rakabganj, then they stayed on the movement
 tabhi main inke bich gaya tha or samajhane kaa prayaas kiya tha ki ye kya maamla he
 All of them came in black clothes so that according to the coverage of the media, a visual element could also be made, but no media came
 kya aap ek naagarik ke taur par iskaa hisaab rakhana chahenge ki vot dene ke baad jab sarkaar ke saamne janata awaz uthaati he to vah sarkaar unki awaz sunati he yaa nahin
 Before August 2017, they had also agitated on January 30-31 2017
 usase bhi pehle disambar 2016 main andolan kar chuke the
 You tell me, the railway from which you have taken training, the same railway should not give a job, and when you ask any question, should it be so
 hamane jab pichley saal dikhaaya tha tab inhen yakeen nahin hua tha ki prime time main koi dikhaa saktaa he
 Today, when our colleague Sunil Kumar Singh went to talk to them, the youth became emotional
 dekhie agar media samaaj ke khilaaf ho jaataa he to aadmi kitna asahaay ho jaataa he
 Today's dock media has turned against the public
 aap jaanate hai ki railway ne is saal kareeb 90,000 bhartiyon nikaali hai
 But you do not know whether there is a structure to fulfill these recruitments or not, and in how many years these recruitments will be completed
 kya aap yah bhi jaanate hai ki railway ke paas 2 lakh 20 hazaar se adhik vekency he
 But the Railways has told the standing committee of Parliament that it is not its intention to fill all the posts
 baaki padon ko outsource yani theke par bhare jane kaa vikalp dekha ja rahaa he
 Today even if the railways announces the reinstatement of all 2 lakh 20 thousand posts, even then it cannot complete this recruitment before two to three years
 rail mantri kehete hai ki 20 pratishat reserve rakhane kii niti supreme court ke aadesh ke baad bani he lekin aprintins kehete hai ki railway kii apni banaai hui niti he
 Now we have no opinion on this because i do not have the facts
 bas ek patr he
 At this time, there is no big news in India except unemployment, jobs, and poor state of examination system
 agar ye khabar pehle panne par nahin he to yuvaaon ko akhbaar padhanaa chhod dena chahie
 Must stop watching TV
 aap sochie agra ke biaar ambedkar uniwarsity ke chaatro par kya biit rahi hogi, riselt nahin aayaa he lihaaza jo bhartee nikali he uske liye applai bhi nahin kar sakate
 They will also see how much Hindu Muslim debate
 din bhar agra se hataash maayoos chaatro kaa phone aa rahaa he ki hamaara riselt nikalava dijie
 Would you like your children to be punished and punished? ham ek sipaahi kaa imtahaan nahin kara paa rahe hai, bina chori or dhaandhlee ke
 On March 20, the Rajasthan Police Recruitment Exam was completely canceled
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 18 oktober 2017 ko 5500 sipaahiyon kii bhartee ke liye vigyaapan nikaala tha
 There was a fee of Rs 400 for general students, Rs 300 for scheduled castes and tribes
 itnaa paisa dekar chaar maheene baad jab march 2018 main imtahaan hota he to vah nakal ke kaaran radd ho jaati he
 Similarly, the headline is made at the time of every exam, and after the cancellation, the headline disappears gradually
 yuvaaon kaa kitna samay barbaad hua he
 Rajasthan Patrika has written that 16 lakh candidates are going to be affected
 15 march ke bhaskar main khabar chhapi he ki mukhyamantri ne tay kiya he ki is saal disbanr tak sari bhartee puri ho jaaegi
 You see how much recruitment is completed
 jab ham 5500 padon par bahaali samay se bina chori ke nahin kara sakate to kya 90,000 yaa 1 lakh padon kii bahaali bina teen chaar saal ke ho sakati he
 At times, it seems that governments leave such laxity that the case is canceled, and if not canceled, then it gets stuck in the case
 ieneldi ke saansad dushyant chautaala ne shram mantri se sawaal poocha he ki pichley teen saal main berojgaare kii vruddhi dar kya he, us dauraan naukari dene kaa kya lakshya tha, usamen kitni safalataa praapt hui he
 So the answer is that no target has been set by the government
 tathaapi, rojgaar srijan evam niyojaneeyata main sudhaar karnaa sarkaar kii pramukh praathamikta rahi he
 Many policies have been counted with this answer, from Mudra Yojana to Skill India
 magar unke kaaran kitnon ko rojgaar mila iskaa koi aankada nahin diya gaya he
 Whether the government does not have figures to tell or it does not have figures at all
 ye to agle chunaav ke slogan se hi pataa chalegaa
 These boys have visited Mumbai many times from different cities of Maharashtra
 19 march ko enditivi mumbai ke daftar pahunch gaye
 Then came also on 20 March
 ye bachche dilli aakar prime time ke liye apni kahani bataanaa chaahate the magar inke paas dilli aane tak ke liye paise nahin the isliye ye mumbai sthit hamaare daftar gaye
 Around 450 students are waiting for their appointment with Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited Mahagenco
 2014 main dipti eczecutive ejeeniyar ke 212 pad kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha, jiske liye 17000 chaatro ne applai kar diya
 The form was filled by giving 500 rupees
 11 janvari 2015 main likhit pariksha lee gai
 Result came on 20 March 2015
 450 log paas hue
 When he felt that he would get a government job, he quit his old job
 koi bhi chhod degaa kyonki sarkari naukari jo mili thi
 But a student filed a case on 4 June 2016
 in chaatro ne cese karne vaale chaatr se sampark kiya, use samajhaayaa ki sarkaar to sirf date lekar chali jaati he, mukadmaa to ladati nahin he or tumhaare chalate hamaara jivan barbaad ho gaya to us ladke ne julai 2017 main cese waapas le liya
 Now all the obstacles of their joining had gone away
 lekin uske baad saat maheene se zyaada samay ho chuke hai magar inaki jwining nahin hui he
 The decision of the court has come in their favor, even after this, there is no joining
 iskaa koi hisaab he ki saat maheene se ye jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai, yahaan vahaan bhatak rahe hai, awwal aapane duniya main kahi suna he ki sab kuch clear ho jane ke baad saat saat maheene tak jwining nahin ho rahi he
 The same is the position of the Staff Selection Commission
 abhi bhi hazaron chaatro ko agast 2017 main pariksha paas karne ke baad jwining letters nahin mila he
 Around a thousand students are waiting for the joining letter for the CAG assistant auditor
 in bacchon ke saath ye ninsaphi bardaasht kaise kii ja sakati he
 Outside the Staff Selection Commission, students have made a big agitation for rigging several times in examinations
 sansad kii sthai samiti kii report bhi ai he
 This report states that there are 2,220 court cases on the Staff Selection Commission
 to sawaal aata he ki court main cese kii sunwaayee tej gati se ho iskaa prayaas hona chahie kyonki isse naujavaanon kii zindagi barbaad ho rahi he
 The simple thing is, then if you listen to the vacancy of the judges, then today you will not be able to eat food, not only that something is happening other than slogan
 tippaniyan The report of the parliamentary committee says that in ten years, the responsibility of SSC has been taken to take the examination of more than twenty times the students
 2008-09 ke dauraan esayssi ke imtahaanon main kareeb das lakh chaatro ne hissaa liya tha
 In 2016-17, the number of students in SSC examinations increased to 2 crore
 lekin itani badi sankhya main chaatro ko sanbhaalane ke liye karmchaariyon kii sankhya jas kii tas he
 For ten years, the number of sanctioned posts of Commission staff has been stuck at 481 only
 isamen se bhi is vakt 115 pad khaali hai yani 24 pratishat pad khaali hai
 This commission does not fill the staff within its time
 do karod chaatr esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil hote hai
 Due to this, the lives of two crore students are affected, but the problems of its students did not get media coverage
 naukari series or inke apane andolan ke kaaran aaj aap esayssi ke bare main jaanate hai magar aap dekhie ki berojgaare badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne hi sara intazaam kiya hua he
 If it is not discussed then how will it change
 kab badalegaa

 tippaniyan The report of the parliamentary committee says that in ten years, the responsibility of SSC has been taken to take the examination of more than twenty times the students
 2008-09 ke dauraan esayssi ke imtahaanon main kareeb das lakh chaatro ne hissaa liya tha
 In 2016-17, the number of students in SSC examinations increased to 2 crore
 lekin itani badi sankhya main chaatro ko sanbhaalane ke liye karmchaariyon kii sankhya jas kii tas he
 For ten years, the number of sanctioned posts of Commission staff has been stuck at 481 only
 isamen se bhi is vakt 115 pad khaali hai yani 24 pratishat pad khaali hai
 This commission does not fill the staff within its time
 do karod chaatr esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil hote hai
 Due to this, the lives of two crore students are affected, but the problems of its students did not get media coverage
 naukari series or inke apane andolan ke kaaran aaj aap esayssi ke bare main jaanate hai magar aap dekhie ki berojgaare badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne hi sara intazaam kiya hua he
 If it is not discussed then how will it change
 kab badalegaa
 Our partners Sunil Kumar Singh and Sohit Mishra were covering the Tuesday event
 aisa nahin he ki sarkaar ko inke pradarshan kii jaankaree nahin thi
 On March 12, the Railway Apprentice staged a sit-in in front of the BJP office in Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, and Yeddyurappa also came to meet them
 kaha ki ve rail mantri se baat karenge
 The youth ended the picket on Yeddyurappa's assurance
 magar uske baad kuch nahin hua to ve 19 march se usee shahar main railway ke daaarem ke daftar ke baahar dharne par baith gaye hai
 They claim that more than 2000 youth have joined the dharna
 vaise ve bharat bhar main berojgaar aprintis kii sankhya 20,000 bataate hai
 Most 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 passes are out
 is bich 2016 ke saal main mumbai main 699 or gorakhpur main 45 or nardan railway main 13 aprintins rakhe gaye hai magar baaki berojgaar gum rahe hai
 When Yeddyurappa gave the assurance and these youth gave information to the General Manager of All India Railway Zone, even then their demand was not heard
 darasal noujvaan jab andolan karte hai to sarkarein sochati hai ki inhen koun cover karegaa
 There will be a commotion for two days and then the media will get busy with communal statements of an MP
 zarur in naujavaanon ko rail nahin rokani chahie thi lekin kya inaki baat kisi ko sunani nahin chahie thi? Last August, the Railway Apprentice came to Delhi
 10 agast se 21 agast ke bich jantar mantar par jamaa hue
 There was no money in his pocket
 haalat kharaab ho gai
 Some became ill within the first two-three days
 baad main gurudwara rakabganj kii taraf se inke khaane pine kaa intazaam karaayaa gaya tab jaakar ye andolan par date rahe
 Then i went among them and tried to understand what was the matter
 ye sabhi kaale kapade main aae the taaki media ke kawarej ke hisaab se vijual element bhi ban saken magar koi media nahin aayaa
 Would you, as a citizen, want to keep an account of whether the government listens to their voice when the public raises their voice in front of the government after voting
 agast 2017 se pehle ye janvari 30-31 2017 ko bhi andolan kar chuke the
 They had agitated in December 2016 even before that
 aap hi bataaiye, jis railway se training lee ho, vahi railway naukari na de, or jab sawaal kare to kisi ko fark na pade, kya aisa hona chahie
 When we showed last year, he was not sure that anyone could show in prime time
 aaj sab hamaare sahyogi sunil kumaar singh inase baat karne gaye to noujvaan bhavuk ho gaye
 See how helpless a man becomes if the media goes against society
 aaj kaa godi media janata ke khilaaf ho gaya he
 You know that the Railways has removed about 90,000 recruits this year
 magar aap yah nahin jaanate ki in bhartiyon ko puraa karne kaa dhaancha he bhi yaa nahin or kitne saal main ye bhartiyon puri hongi
 Do you also know that the railway has more than 2 lakh 20 thousand vacancies
 magar railway ne sansad kii sthai samiti se kaha he ki uskaa iraadaa sabhi padon ko bharne kaa nahin he
 The option of outsourcing the remaining positions is being seen
 aaj agar railway sabhi 2 lakh 20 hazaar padon kii bahaali kaa elaan bhi kar de to bhi vah do teen saal se pehle is bharti ko puri nahin kar sakati he
 The Railway Minister says that the policy of keeping 20 percent reserve has been formed after the order of the Supreme Court, but the apprentices say that the Railways have their own policy
 ab is par hamaari koi raay nahin kyonki mere paas tathy nahin hai
 Just a letter
 is vakt bharat main berojgaare, naukari, pariksha pranali kii jarjar haalat ke alaava koi badi khabar nahin he
 If this news is not on the front page, then the youth should stop reading the newspaper
 tivi dekhnaa band kar dena chahie
 Think about what will happen to the students of BR Ambedkar University in Agra, the results have not come, so you cannot apply for the recruitment that has come out
 ve bhi kitna hindu muslim dibet dekhenge
 Throughout the day, there is a call from desperate students from Agra to get our results out
 kya aap chahenge ki aapke bacchon ko bhi yahi sazaa mili or kis baat kii sazaa mili
 We are not able to test a soldier without stealing and rigging
 20 march ko hi rajasthan me sipaahi bhartee pariksha puri tarah nirast kar di gai
 The Rajasthan government on 18 October 2017 had advertised for the recruitment of 5500 soldiers
 saamaanya chaatro ke liye 400, anusuchit jati or janajati ke liye 300 rupye kii fees thi
 After four months, when the examination takes place in March 2018, it gets canceled due to copying
 isi tarah har pariksha nikalne ke vakt hedline banati he, radd hone ke vakt hedline banane ke baad dhire-dhire gaayab ho jaati he
 How much time has been wasted by the youth
 rajasthan patrika ne likhaa he ki 16 lakh abhyarthi prabhavit hone ja rahe hai
 The news has appeared in Bhaskar of 15 March that the Chief Minister has decided that all the recruitment will be completed by December this year
 aap dekhte chaliye kitni bhartee puri hoti he
 When we cannot get 5500 posts reinstated without stealing on time, can 90,000 or 1 lakh posts be restored without three to four years
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkarein hi aisi dheel chhod detii hai ki maamla radd hota rahe, radd na ho to mukademe main fansata rahe
 INLD MP Dushyant Chautala has asked the Labor Minister the question of what is the growth rate of unemployment in the last three years, what was the goal of giving jobs during that time, how much success has been achieved in it
 to jawaab diya gaya he ki sarkaar dwaara koi lakshya nahin rakhaa gaya he
 However, improving employment generation and employability has been a major priority of the government
 is jawaab ke saath bahut sari nitiyaan gina di gayi hai, vahi mudra yojana se lekar skill india tak
 But no data has been given on how many people got employment because of them
 kya sarkaar ke paas bataane laayak aankade nahin hai yaa phir aankade he hi nahin
 This will be known only from the slogan of the next election
 maharashtra ke alag alag shaharon se ye ladke kai baar mumbai kaa chakkar laga chuke hai
 NDTV reached Mumbai's office on 19 March
 phir 20 march ko bhi aae
 These children wanted to come to Delhi and tell their story for prime time but they did not have money to come to Delhi so they went to our office in Mumbai
 kareeb 450 kii sankhya main ye chaatr maharashtra state power janareshan company limited mahajenko main apni niyukti kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 In 2014, 212 posts of deputy executive engineers were advertised, for which 17000 students applied
 500 rupee dekar farm bharaa tha
 Written test was taken on 11 January 2015
 20 march 2015 ko riselt aayaa
 450 people passed
 jab laga ki sarkari naukari mil jaaegi to inhone puraani naukari chhod di
 No one will leave because the government job they got
 lekin ek chaatr ne 4 june 2016 ko cese kar diya
 These students approached the student who made the case, explained to him that the government only goes on a date, the case is not contested and because of you ruining our life, the boy withdrew the case in July 2017
 ab inaki jwining kii sari adchane dur ho gai thi
 But after that it has been more than seven months but they have not joined
 adaalat kaa nirnay inke paksh main hi aayaa he iske baad bhi jwining nahin hui he
 It is a calculation that for seven months, they have been waiting for joining, wandering here and there, you have heard in the world that everything is not joining for seven months after clearing everything
 staff salection kamishan kaa bhi yahi haal he
 Thousands of students still have not received the joining letter after passing the exam in August 2017
 sieji ke sahaayak auditor ke liye hazaar ke kareeb chaatr jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 How can this injustice be tolerated with these children? staff salection kamishan ke baahar chaatr kai baar pareekshaon main dhaandhlee ko lekar bada andolan kar chuke hai
 The report of the Standing Committee of Parliament has also come
 is report main kaha gaya he ki staff salection kamishan par 2,220 court cese hai
 So the question comes that the trial of the case in the court should be done at a fast pace because it is ruining the lives of the youth
 simpal baat he, phir aap jajon kii vekainsee kaa haal sunenge to aaj khaanaa nahin kha paaenge lagegaa hi nahin ki slogan ke alaava kuch ho bhi rahaa he
 The comments sansadeey samiti kii report main kaha gaya he ki das saal main esayssi ke jimme bees guna se adhik chaatro kii pariksha lene kii zimmedaari aa gai he
 About one million students participated in SSC examinations during 2008-09
 2016-17 main esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil chaatro kii sankhya badhkar 2 karod ho gai
 But the number of employees to handle such a large number of students remains the same
 das saal se ayog ke karmchaariyon kii sweekrut padon kii sankhya 481 par hi ataki he
 Of this, 115 posts are vacant at this time i
e
 24 per cent are vacant
 yah ayog apane bheetar karmchaariyon ko samay se nahin bhar paata he
 Twenty million students attend SSC examinations
 iske kaaran do karod chaatro kii zindagi prabhavit hoti he phir bhi iske chaatro kii samasyaon ko media kawarez nahin miltaa tha
 Today you know about SSC due to job series and their own movement, but you see that the government has made all the arrangements to increase unemployment
 agar is par charchaa nahin hogi to yah kaise badalegaa
 When will it change naujavaanon ne yediurppa ke aashwaasan par dharna samaapt kar diya
 But if nothing happens after that, they have sat on a dharna outside the railway's DMM office in the same city since 19 March
 inkaa daawa he ki 2000 se adhik noujvaan vahaan ke dharne main shaamil ho chuke hai
 By the way, they cite 20,000 unemployed apprentices across India
 zyaadaatar 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 ke paas out hai
 Meanwhile, in the year of 2016, 699 in Mumbai and 45 in Gorakhpur and 13 Apprentices have been kept in Northern Railway but the rest are unemployed
 yediurppa ne jab aashwaasan diya or in naujavaanon ne ol india railway zone ke mahaprabandhan ko soochna de di tab bhi inaki maang par sunwaayee nahin hui
 In fact, when the youth agitate, the governments wonder who will cover them
 do din hangaamaa karenge or phir media kisi saansad ke sampradayik bayaan ko lekar vyast ho jayega
 Surely these youth should not have stopped the train but should not anyone have listened to them? pichley agast ye railway aprintis dilli aae the
 Between 10 August and 21 August, Jantar gathered at Mantar
 inaki jeb main paise nahin the
 The condition worsened
 kuch to pehle do teen din main hi biimaar ho gaye
 Later, arrangements were made to drink their food from Gurdwara Rakabganj, then they stayed on the movement
 tabhi main inke bich gaya tha or samajhane kaa prayaas kiya tha ki ye kya maamla he
 All of them came in black clothes so that according to the coverage of the media, a visual element could also be made, but no media came
 kya aap ek naagarik ke taur par iskaa hisaab rakhana chahenge ki vot dene ke baad jab sarkaar ke saamne janata awaz uthaati he to vah sarkaar unki awaz sunati he yaa nahin
 Before August 2017, they had also agitated on January 30-31 2017
 usase bhi pehle disambar 2016 main andolan kar chuke the
 You tell me, the railway from which you have taken training, the same railway should not give a job, and when you ask any question, should it be so
 hamane jab pichley saal dikhaaya tha tab inhen yakeen nahin hua tha ki prime time main koi dikhaa saktaa he
 Today, when our colleague Sunil Kumar Singh went to talk to them, the youth became emotional
 dekhie agar media samaaj ke khilaaf ho jaataa he to aadmi kitna asahaay ho jaataa he
 Today's dock media has turned against the public
 aap jaanate hai ki railway ne is saal kareeb 90,000 bhartiyon nikaali hai
 But you do not know whether there is a structure to fulfill these recruitments or not, and in how many years these recruitments will be completed
 kya aap yah bhi jaanate hai ki railway ke paas 2 lakh 20 hazaar se adhik vekency he
 But the Railways has told the standing committee of Parliament that it is not its intention to fill all the posts
 baaki padon ko outsource yani theke par bhare jane kaa vikalp dekha ja rahaa he
 Today even if the railways announces the reinstatement of all 2 lakh 20 thousand posts, even then it cannot complete this recruitment before two to three years
 rail mantri kehete hai ki 20 pratishat reserve rakhane kii niti supreme court ke aadesh ke baad bani he lekin aprintins kehete hai ki railway kii apni banaai hui niti he
 Now we have no opinion on this because i do not have the facts
 bas ek patr he
 At this time, there is no big news in India except unemployment, jobs, and poor state of examination system
 agar ye khabar pehle panne par nahin he to yuvaaon ko akhbaar padhanaa chhod dena chahie
 Must stop watching TV
 aap sochie agra ke biaar ambedkar uniwarsity ke chaatro par kya biit rahi hogi, riselt nahin aayaa he lihaaza jo bhartee nikali he uske liye applai bhi nahin kar sakate
 They will also see how much Hindu Muslim debate
 din bhar agra se hataash maayoos chaatro kaa phone aa rahaa he ki hamaara riselt nikalava dijie
 Would you like your children to be punished and punished? ham ek sipaahi kaa imtahaan nahin kara paa rahe hai, bina chori or dhaandhlee ke
 On March 20, the Rajasthan Police Recruitment Exam was completely canceled
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 18 oktober 2017 ko 5500 sipaahiyon kii bhartee ke liye vigyaapan nikaala tha
 There was a fee of Rs 400 for general students, Rs 300 for scheduled castes and tribes
 itnaa paisa dekar chaar maheene baad jab march 2018 main imtahaan hota he to vah nakal ke kaaran radd ho jaati he
 Similarly, the headline is made at the time of every exam, and after the cancellation, the headline disappears gradually
 yuvaaon kaa kitna samay barbaad hua he
 Rajasthan Patrika has written that 16 lakh candidates are going to be affected
 15 march ke bhaskar main khabar chhapi he ki mukhyamantri ne tay kiya he ki is saal disbanr tak sari bhartee puri ho jaaegi
 You see how much recruitment is completed
 jab ham 5500 padon par bahaali samay se bina chori ke nahin kara sakate to kya 90,000 yaa 1 lakh padon kii bahaali bina teen chaar saal ke ho sakati he
 At times, it seems that governments leave such laxity that the case is canceled, and if not canceled, then it gets stuck in the case
 ieneldi ke saansad dushyant chautaala ne shram mantri se sawaal poocha he ki pichley teen saal main berojgaare kii vruddhi dar kya he, us dauraan naukari dene kaa kya lakshya tha, usamen kitni safalataa praapt hui he
 So the answer is that no target has been set by the government
 tathaapi, rojgaar srijan evam niyojaneeyata main sudhaar karnaa sarkaar kii pramukh praathamikta rahi he
 Many policies have been counted with this answer, from Mudra Yojana to Skill India
 magar unke kaaran kitnon ko rojgaar mila iskaa koi aankada nahin diya gaya he
 Whether the government does not have figures to tell or it does not have figures at all
 ye to agle chunaav ke slogan se hi pataa chalegaa
 These boys have visited Mumbai many times from different cities of Maharashtra
 19 march ko enditivi mumbai ke daftar pahunch gaye
 Then came also on 20 March
 ye bachche dilli aakar prime time ke liye apni kahani bataanaa chaahate the magar inke paas dilli aane tak ke liye paise nahin the isliye ye mumbai sthit hamaare daftar gaye

 The form was filled by giving 500 rupees
 11 janvari 2015 main likhit pariksha lee gai
 Result came on 20 March 2015
 450 log paas hue
 When he felt that he would get a government job, he quit his old job
 koi bhi chhod degaa kyonki sarkari naukari jo mili thi
 But a student filed a case on 4 June 2016
 in chaatro ne cese karne vaale chaatr se sampark kiya, use samajhaayaa ki sarkaar to sirf date lekar chali jaati he, mukadmaa to ladati nahin he or tumhaare chalate hamaara jivan barbaad ho gaya to us ladke ne julai 2017 main cese waapas le liya
 Now all the obstacles of their joining had gone away
 lekin uske baad saat maheene se zyaada samay ho chuke hai magar inaki jwining nahin hui he
 The decision of the court has come in their favor, even after this, there is no joining

 The same is the position of the Staff Selection Commission
 abhi bhi hazaron chaatro ko agast 2017 main pariksha paas karne ke baad jwining letters nahin mila he
 Around a thousand students are waiting for the joining letter for the CAG assistant auditor

 Outside the Staff Selection Commission, students have made a big agitation for rigging several times in examinations

 isamen se bhi is vakt 115 pad khaali hai yani 24 pratishat pad khaali hai
 This commission does not fill the staff within its time
 do karod chaatr esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil hote hai
 Due to this, the lives of two crore students are affected, but the problems of its students did not get media coverage
 naukari series or inke apane andolan ke kaaran aaj aap esayssi ke bare main jaanate hai magar aap dekhie ki berojgaare badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne hi sara intazaam kiya hua he
 If it is not discussed then how will it change
 kab badalegaa
 Last August, the Railway Apprentice came to Delhi
 10 agast se 21 agast ke bich jantar mantar par jamaa hue
 There was no money in his pocket
 haalat kharaab ho gai
 Some became ill within the first two-three days
 baad main gurudwara rakabganj kii taraf se inke khaane pine kaa intazaam karaayaa gaya tab jaakar ye andolan par date rahe
 Then i went among them and tried to understand what was the matter
 ye sabhi kaale kapade main aae the taaki media ke kawarej ke hisaab se vijual element bhi ban saken magar koi media nahin aayaa
 Would you, as a citizen, want to keep an account of whether the government listens to their voice when the public raises their voice in front of the government after voting
 agast 2017 se pehle ye janvari 30-31 2017 ko bhi andolan kar chuke the
 They had agitated in December 2016 even before that
 aap hi bataaiye, jis railway se training lee ho, vahi railway naukari na de, or jab sawaal kare to kisi ko fark na pade, kya aisa hona chahie
 When we showed last year, he was not sure that anyone could show in prime time
 aaj sab hamaare sahyogi sunil kumaar singh inase baat karne gaye to noujvaan bhavuk ho gaye
 See how helpless a man becomes if the media goes against society
 aaj kaa godi media janata ke khilaaf ho gaya he
 You know that the Railways has removed about 90,000 recruits this year
 magar aap yah nahin jaanate ki in bhartiyon ko puraa karne kaa dhaancha he bhi yaa nahin or kitne saal main ye bhartiyon puri hongi
 Do you also know that the railway has more than 2 lakh 20 thousand vacancies
 magar railway ne sansad kii sthai samiti se kaha he ki uskaa iraadaa sabhi padon ko bharne kaa nahin he
 The option of outsourcing the remaining positions is being seen
 aaj agar railway sabhi 2 lakh 20 hazaar padon kii bahaali kaa elaan bhi kar de to bhi vah do teen saal se pehle is bharti ko puri nahin kar sakati he
 The Railway Minister says that the policy of keeping 20 percent reserve has been formed after the order of the Supreme Court, but the apprentices say that the Railways have their own policy
 ab is par hamaari koi raay nahin kyonki mere paas tathy nahin hai
 Just a letter
 is vakt bharat main berojgaare, naukari, pariksha pranali kii jarjar haalat ke alaava koi badi khabar nahin he
 If this news is not on the front page, then the youth should stop reading the newspaper
 tivi dekhnaa band kar dena chahie
 Think about what will happen to the students of BR Ambedkar University in Agra, the results have not come, so you cannot apply for the recruitment that has come out
 ve bhi kitna hindu muslim dibet dekhenge
 Throughout the day, there is a call from desperate students from Agra to get our results out
 kya aap chahenge ki aapke bacchon ko bhi yahi sazaa mili or kis baat kii sazaa mili
 We are not able to test a soldier without stealing and rigging
 20 march ko hi rajasthan me sipaahi bhartee pariksha puri tarah nirast kar di gai
 The Rajasthan government on 18 October 2017 had advertised for the recruitment of 5500 soldiers
 saamaanya chaatro ke liye 400, anusuchit jati or janajati ke liye 300 rupye kii fees thi
 After four months, when the examination takes place in March 2018, it gets canceled due to copying
 isi tarah har pariksha nikalne ke vakt hedline banati he, radd hone ke vakt hedline banane ke baad dhire-dhire gaayab ho jaati he
 How much time has been wasted by the youth
 rajasthan patrika ne likhaa he ki 16 lakh abhyarthi prabhavit hone ja rahe hai
 The news has appeared in Bhaskar of 15 March that the Chief Minister has decided that all the recruitment will be completed by December this year
 aap dekhte chaliye kitni bhartee puri hoti he
 When we cannot get 5500 posts reinstated without stealing on time, can 90,000 or 1 lakh posts be restored without three to four years
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkarein hi aisi dheel chhod detii hai ki maamla radd hota rahe, radd na ho to mukademe main fansata rahe
 INLD MP Dushyant Chautala has asked the Labor Minister the question of what is the growth rate of unemployment in the last three years, what was the goal of giving jobs during that time, how much success has been achieved in it
 to jawaab diya gaya he ki sarkaar dwaara koi lakshya nahin rakhaa gaya he
 However, improving employment generation and employability has been a major priority of the government
 is jawaab ke saath bahut sari nitiyaan gina di gayi hai, vahi mudra yojana se lekar skill india tak
 But no data has been given on how many people got employment because of them
 kya sarkaar ke paas bataane laayak aankade nahin hai yaa phir aankade he hi nahin
 This will be known only from the slogan of the next election
 maharashtra ke alag alag shaharon se ye ladke kai baar mumbai kaa chakkar laga chuke hai
 NDTV reached Mumbai's office on 19 March
 phir 20 march ko bhi aae
 These children wanted to come to Delhi and tell their story for prime time but they did not have money to come to Delhi so they went to our office in Mumbai
 kareeb 450 kii sankhya main ye chaatr maharashtra state power janareshan company limited mahajenko main apni niyukti kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 In 2014, 212 posts of deputy executive engineers were advertised, for which 17000 students applied
 500 rupee dekar farm bharaa tha
 Written test was taken on 11 January 2015
 20 march 2015 ko riselt aayaa
 450 people passed
 jab laga ki sarkari naukari mil jaaegi to inhone puraani naukari chhod di
 No one will leave because the government job they got
 lekin ek chaatr ne 4 june 2016 ko cese kar diya
 These students approached the student who made the case, explained to him that the government only goes on a date, the case is not contested and because of you ruining our life, the boy withdrew the case in July 2017
 ab inaki jwining kii sari adchane dur ho gai thi
 But after that it has been more than seven months but they have not joined
 adaalat kaa nirnay inke paksh main hi aayaa he iske baad bhi jwining nahin hui he
 It is a calculation that for seven months, they have been waiting for joining, wandering here and there, you have heard in the world that everything is not joining for seven months after clearing everything
 staff salection kamishan kaa bhi yahi haal he
 Thousands of students still have not received the joining letter after passing the exam in August 2017
 sieji ke sahaayak auditor ke liye hazaar ke kareeb chaatr jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 How can this injustice be tolerated with these children? staff salection kamishan ke baahar chaatr kai baar pareekshaon main dhaandhlee ko lekar bada andolan kar chuke hai
 The report of the Standing Committee of Parliament has also come
 is report main kaha gaya he ki staff salection kamishan par 2,220 court cese hai
 So the question comes that the trial of the case in the court should be done at a fast pace because it is ruining the lives of the youth
 simpal baat he, phir aap jajon kii vekainsee kaa haal sunenge to aaj khaanaa nahin kha paaenge lagegaa hi nahin ki slogan ke alaava kuch ho bhi rahaa he
 The comments sansadeey samiti kii report main kaha gaya he ki das saal main esayssi ke jimme bees guna se adhik chaatro kii pariksha lene kii zimmedaari aa gai he
 About one million students participated in SSC examinations during 2008-09
 2016-17 main esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil chaatro kii sankhya badhkar 2 karod ho gai
 But the number of employees to handle such a large number of students remains the same
 das saal se ayog ke karmchaariyon kii sweekrut padon kii sankhya 481 par hi ataki he
 Of this, 115 posts are vacant at this time i
e
 24 per cent are vacant
 yah ayog apane bheetar karmchaariyon ko samay se nahin bhar paata he
 Twenty million students attend SSC examinations
 iske kaaran do karod chaatro kii zindagi prabhavit hoti he phir bhi iske chaatro kii samasyaon ko media kawarez nahin miltaa tha
 Today you know about SSC due to job series and their own movement, but you see that the government has made all the arrangements to increase unemployment
 agar is par charchaa nahin hogi to yah kaise badalegaa
 When will it change aap jaanate hai ki railway ne is saal kareeb 90,000 bhartiyon nikaali hai
 But you do not know whether there is a structure to fulfill these recruitments or not, and in how many years these recruitments will be completed
 kya aap yah bhi jaanate hai ki railway ke paas 2 lakh 20 hazaar se adhik vekency he
 But the Railways has told the standing committee of Parliament that it is not its intention to fill all the posts
 baaki padon ko outsource yani theke par bhare jane kaa vikalp dekha ja rahaa he
 Today even if the railways announces the reinstatement of all 2 lakh 20 thousand posts, even then it cannot complete this recruitment before two to three years
 rail mantri kehete hai ki 20 pratishat reserve rakhane kii niti supreme court ke aadesh ke baad bani he lekin aprintins kehete hai ki railway kii apni banaai hui niti he
 Now we have no opinion on this because i do not have the facts
 bas ek patr he
 At this time, there is no big news in India except unemployment, jobs, and poor state of examination system
 agar ye khabar pehle panne par nahin he to yuvaaon ko akhbaar padhanaa chhod dena chahie
 Must stop watching TV
 aap sochie agra ke biaar ambedkar uniwarsity ke chaatro par kya biit rahi hogi, riselt nahin aayaa he lihaaza jo bhartee nikali he uske liye applai bhi nahin kar sakate
 They will also see how much Hindu Muslim debate
 din bhar agra se hataash maayoos chaatro kaa phone aa rahaa he ki hamaara riselt nikalava dijie
 Would you like your children to be punished and punished? ham ek sipaahi kaa imtahaan nahin kara paa rahe hai, bina chori or dhaandhlee ke
 On March 20, the Rajasthan Police Recruitment Exam was completely canceled
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 18 oktober 2017 ko 5500 sipaahiyon kii bhartee ke liye vigyaapan nikaala tha
 There was a fee of Rs 400 for general students, Rs 300 for scheduled castes and tribes
 itnaa paisa dekar chaar maheene baad jab march 2018 main imtahaan hota he to vah nakal ke kaaran radd ho jaati he
 Similarly, the headline is made at the time of every exam, and after the cancellation, the headline disappears gradually
 yuvaaon kaa kitna samay barbaad hua he
 Rajasthan Patrika has written that 16 lakh candidates are going to be affected
 15 march ke bhaskar main khabar chhapi he ki mukhyamantri ne tay kiya he ki is saal disbanr tak sari bhartee puri ho jaaegi
 You see how much recruitment is completed
 jab ham 5500 padon par bahaali samay se bina chori ke nahin kara sakate to kya 90,000 yaa 1 lakh padon kii bahaali bina teen chaar saal ke ho sakati he
 At times, it seems that governments leave such laxity that the case is canceled, and if not canceled, then it gets stuck in the case
 ieneldi ke saansad dushyant chautaala ne shram mantri se sawaal poocha he ki pichley teen saal main berojgaare kii vruddhi dar kya he, us dauraan naukari dene kaa kya lakshya tha, usamen kitni safalataa praapt hui he
 So the answer is that no target has been set by the government
 tathaapi, rojgaar srijan evam niyojaneeyata main sudhaar karnaa sarkaar kii pramukh praathamikta rahi he
 Many policies have been counted with this answer, from Mudra Yojana to Skill India
 magar unke kaaran kitnon ko rojgaar mila iskaa koi aankada nahin diya gaya he
 Whether the government does not have figures to tell or it does not have figures at all
 ye to agle chunaav ke slogan se hi pataa chalegaa
 These boys have visited Mumbai many times from different cities of Maharashtra
 19 march ko enditivi mumbai ke daftar pahunch gaye
 Then came also on 20 March
 ye bachche dilli aakar prime time ke liye apni kahani bataanaa chaahate the magar inke paas dilli aane tak ke liye paise nahin the isliye ye mumbai sthit hamaare daftar gaye
 Around 450 students are waiting for their appointment with Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited Mahagenco
 2014 main dipti eczecutive ejeeniyar ke 212 pad kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha, jiske liye 17000 chaatro ne applai kar diya
 The form was filled by giving 500 rupees
 11 janvari 2015 main likhit pariksha lee gai
 Result came on 20 March 2015
 450 log paas hue
 When he felt that he would get a government job, he quit his old job
 koi bhi chhod degaa kyonki sarkari naukari jo mili thi
 But a student filed a case on 4 June 2016
 in chaatro ne cese karne vaale chaatr se sampark kiya, use samajhaayaa ki sarkaar to sirf date lekar chali jaati he, mukadmaa to ladati nahin he or tumhaare chalate hamaara jivan barbaad ho gaya to us ladke ne julai 2017 main cese waapas le liya
 Now all the obstacles of their joining had gone away
 lekin uske baad saat maheene se zyaada samay ho chuke hai magar inaki jwining nahin hui he
 The decision of the court has come in their favor, even after this, there is no joining
 iskaa koi hisaab he ki saat maheene se ye jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai, yahaan vahaan bhatak rahe hai, awwal aapane duniya main kahi suna he ki sab kuch clear ho jane ke baad saat saat maheene tak jwining nahin ho rahi he
 The same is the position of the Staff Selection Commission
 abhi bhi hazaron chaatro ko agast 2017 main pariksha paas karne ke baad jwining letters nahin mila he
 Around a thousand students are waiting for the joining letter for the CAG assistant auditor
 in bacchon ke saath ye ninsaphi bardaasht kaise kii ja sakati he
 Outside the Staff Selection Commission, students have made a big agitation for rigging several times in examinations
 sansad kii sthai samiti kii report bhi ai he
 This report states that there are 2,220 court cases on the Staff Selection Commission
 to sawaal aata he ki court main cese kii sunwaayee tej gati se ho iskaa prayaas hona chahie kyonki isse naujavaanon kii zindagi barbaad ho rahi he
 The simple thing is, then if you listen to the vacancy of the judges, then today you will not be able to eat food, not only that something is happening other than slogan
 tippaniyan The report of the parliamentary committee says that in ten years, the responsibility of SSC has been taken to take the examination of more than twenty times the students
 2008-09 ke dauraan esayssi ke imtahaanon main kareeb das lakh chaatro ne hissaa liya tha
 In 2016-17, the number of students in SSC examinations increased to 2 crore
 lekin itani badi sankhya main chaatro ko sanbhaalane ke liye karmchaariyon kii sankhya jas kii tas he
 For ten years, the number of sanctioned posts of Commission staff has been stuck at 481 only
 isamen se bhi is vakt 115 pad khaali hai yani 24 pratishat pad khaali hai

 In the present era, the image of a resourceful and influential person emerges in the mind as soon as the word MP or former MP comes to the ear
 magar madhya pradesh ke bundelkhand main ek aise purv saansad hai, jinaki chhavi iske thik ulat he
 He walks on a bicycle and makes a beedi when he gets time
 unhen ilaake ke log 'cycle vaale netaa ji' kah kar bulaate hai
 Former MP Ram Singh Ahirwar lives in a simple house located in narrow lane in Puri Tory locality of Sagar city
 unke paas darshan shaastra main snaatak or angreji sahitya main parasnatak kii degree he
 He contested the Lok Sabha elections from here as a candidate of Bharatiya Jana Sangh in 1967 and he won
 umr ke 82 saal paar kar chuke purv saansad ram singh aaj bhi har roj kai kilometre cycle chalaa kar apano se milte-julate rahete hai
 They do not own any motor vehicle
 ram singh kehete hai, "motor vaahan kii kabhi jarurat hi mahasoos nahin hui or na to motor vaahan hasil karne kaa prayaas hi kiya
 "ram Singh was paralyzed in the last few days, which causes him some difficulty in speaking, but he still has not left the bicycle
 fursat ke samay bidi bhi bana lete hai, jisase unhen kuch kamai ho jaati he
 Not only this, Ram Singh had to struggle a lot to get his pension of MP
 vah bataate hai, "meri saansad kii pension varsh 2005 main kisi tarah shuru ho pai
 Had to struggle for pension for many years
 " vah bhale hi aayu ke 82 varsh paar kar chuke hai, magar sakriyata kam nahin hui he, haa raajnneetik taur par vah sakriy nahin hai
 The BJP has a government at the center and the BJP has also been in power in the state for a decade and a half, but his party has neither given him any importance, nor has he ever been consulted
 ram singh raajnneeti main ai is giravat ko lekar chintit hai
 Ram Singh, who hails from the Scheduled Castes category, recounts the story of becoming an MP, "he used to study in university and earn his living by making beedis at home
 usee dauraan jansangh ne sagar sansadeey seat se ummidavaar bana diya, or main chunaav jeet gaya
 "ram Singh's wife Rajrani says on the question of the prosperity of the present-day leaders," It is good to have facilities, but my husband and i had to struggle for many years to get the pension of MP
 ab isi pension se jivan chalata he
 "ram Singh's neighbor Govind says," Ram Singh is different from other leaders
 vah aise netaa nahin hai, jo ek baar saansad bane or khub suvidhaayen hasil kar le
 He is gentle and straightforward
 kabhi lagata hi nahin ki vah saansad bhi rahe hai
 Let's go on a bicycle and live life by making beedis
 " ram singh ke kanishtha chaatr rahe sagar ke maujuuda saansad lakshminarayan yadav kehete hai, "jab ram singh ko jansangh ne ummidavaar banaaya tha, sabhi chakit rah gaye the
 He also won the election
 magar unhone puraa jivan saadagi se bitaayaa
 a few years ago, when i heard that he was living by making bidis, he was surprised
 " sthaneey raajnneetik vishleshak vinod arya bataate hai, "ram singh ko dekhakar, unke ghar kii haalat dekhakar yah bharosa nahin hota ki vah kabhi saansad rahe
 The standard of living of a small leader is many times better
 vah loktantr ke sachche jhandavardaar hai

 sansadeey chunaav main kul 7,928 ummidavaar maidan main thim
 The opposition Congress fielded a maximum of 54 women while the ruling BJP fielded 53 women candidates
 anya rashtriya partiyon main, bahujan samaaj party ne 24 mahila ummidavaaron ko, akhil bhartiya trinmul congress ne 23, makapa ne 10, bhakpa ne chaar, jabaki rashtravaadi congress party ne ek mahila ummidavaar ko maidan main utaara tha

 In the first Lok Sabha, 22 women were elected, in 1977, this figure was the lowest, in 1977 only 19 women won the election
 haalanki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mahilaon kii sankhya badhkar 11 pratishat tak pahunchi

 kahin log garibon ke acount main paise jamaa kara rahe hai to kahin yuj naao or pe letters ke ofer chal rahe hai yani istemaal abhi karen or paise baad main adaa karen
 The direct and major impact of demonetisation has been on the marriages that people forget luxury weddings and even become obsessed with a simple mood wedding
 aise main hotel nae-nae bijness edia lekar aa rahe hai
 Take, for example, the Hotel Noor Mahal on the Delhi Chandigarh Highway

 The Uniform Civil Code ie (uniform Civil Code) means a secular law
 yah kisi rajya-raashtra main rah rahe sabhi dharm ke logon par samaan rup se lagu hota he
 In other words, the absence of separate 'civil law' for different religions is the basic spirit of the 'uniform Civil Code'
 yah kisi bhi dharm yaa jati ke sabhi nijee kanoonon se upar hota he
 Such laws are applicable in most modern countries of the world
 in deshon main pakistan, bangladesh, malaysia, indonesia or turki jaise desh bhi shaamil hai
 Right to acquire and operate individual level property under the Uniform Civil Code Marriage, Divorce and Adoption The Uniform Civil Code is in relation to India, where the Constitution of India expresses a commitment to ensure equal citizenship law to all citizens in the Directive Principle of State Policy
 haalanki hamaare desh main alag-alag personal lau hone kii vajah se yah kanoon abhi tak lagu nahin ho sakaa he
 Even today, under Muslim personal law, marriage can be severed by calling a Muslim woman three times a divorce
 ise lekar samaaj ke alag-alag hisse main baari asantosh rahaa he
 At the same time, Muslim women have also been opposed

 anya dharmik samudaaon ke kanoon bhartiya sansad ke samvidhan par hi aadhaarit hai
 The Constitution of India and the Uniform Civil Code The Uniform Civil Code is mentioned in Article 44 of Part 4 of the Indian Constitution
 isamen niti-nirdesh he ki uniform civil code kanoon lagu karnaa hi hamaara lakshya hoga
 The Supreme Court has also taken the initiative to know the views of the Central Government towards implementing it many times
 iske alaava court kahati rahi he, 'desh main alag alag personal lau kii vajah se bhram kii sthiti bani rahati he
 The government can overcome this by making the same law
 kya sarkaar aisa karegi ? agar aap aisa chaahate hai to aapako aisa kar dena chahie
 Also know: - Attempts to implement this law were made even before independence

 What does the Muslim Personal Law Board say? The Uniform Civil Code (uniform Civil Code) is not right for India and the Constitution gives Indian citizens the freedom of religion

 There are many cultures in this country that should be respected
 '' The most famous and awe-inspiring legend in ancient Indian texts is Amrit Manthan, that is, the story of Amrit appearing by the churning of the ocean
 is katha ke anusaar ek samay devataaon evam rakshason ne samudr ke manthan tathaa uske dwaara prakat hone vaale sabhi ratnon ko aapas main baantne kaa nirnay kiya
 There were huge differences between them regarding the distribution of these gems
 samudr ke manthan dwaara jo sabase moolyawaan ratna niklaa vah tha amrit, use paane ke liye devataaon or rakshason donon ne ichha prakat kii
 a person drinking nectar becomes immortal
 sarvashaktimaan or avinashi devataaon ko yah kadaapi sweekaar nahin tha ki asur amar ho jaaen evam sansar main paap kaa samrajya faile
 In the story, God and Asuras started fighting for the character of Amrit, then Lord Vishnu took the form of Apsara named Mohini and drove the Amrit Patra away from the Asuras
 asuron se amrit ko bachaane ke liye bhagwaan vishnu ne vah paatr apane vaahan garud ko de diya
 When the Asuras tried to snatch the vessel from Garuda, a few drops of nectar spilled from that vessel and fell in Allahabad, Nashik, Haridwar and Ujjain
 tabhi se prayek 12 varshon ke antaraal par in sthanon par kumbh mela yojit kiya jaataa he
 For churning the ocean, a peak of the mountain was used to churn and a snake was used to make rope
 manthan ke dwaara divya ashv, hathi, pavitra gau aadi utpann hue evam bhayanak vish bhi niklaa jiske dwaara sampurna sristi kaa vinaash ho saktaa tha tab bhagwaan shiv ne us bhayanak vish ko nigal kar sansar kii raksha kii
 Every object generated by the churning even four Vedas were given to different deities
 asuron kii drushti to amrit par thi jaise hi amrit prakat hua use paane ke liye asuro ne devataaon ke viruddh chaal chali
 a demon named Rahu drank nectar and immediately his head was cut off, but his head survived due to the effect of nectar, according to a belief, whenever Rahu swallows the sun, solar eclipse occurs

 narendra modi sarkaar ke pehle rail bajet par raajnneetik or anya halkon se tikhi pratikriya aa rahi hai
 See who said what: Except the area of metro cities, there is nothing in the railway budget about the entire country
 puraane jitne kaam hai unke bare main kuch nahin kaha gaya
 Correct the health of the railway and then bring the bullet train
 ahmedabad or mumbai ke bich kya kami he? vahaan pehle se trainen uplabdh hai, to bullate train kaa matlab kya? jo ilaake pehle se pichde hai jaise chhattisgarh, bihar, assam, rajasthan, madhya pradesh vahaan ke bare main rail bajet main kuch nahin he
 Heal the overall health of the rail and then move forward: Sharad Yadav, Chairman jdurail is nothing new in the budget
 achche din kaa vaada kiya tha lekin pataa nahin kab aaenge achche dinahnitish kumaar, purv rail mantrirel bajet vittiya rup se jimmedaar evam saahasik he
 The common man should be freed from the old government policy of increasing fuel-linked fares
 main bhartiya rail kii vaastavik sthiti ko desh ke saamne rakhane main barti gai paardarshita ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi or rail mantri sadanand gauda kii saraahna karti hum
 The railway budget is a serious step that the new government has been forced to take in view of the mismanagement done in this major area by UPA Sakar in the last decade: Jayalalithaa, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, after completing pending schemes for the last 10 years in budget More emphasis
 bhartiya rail kaa bajet he
 Therefore, no specific state or politics has been made keeping in mind: Piyush Goyal, Union Minister of Energy, where do people have money in the world
 pipipi, world class stesan, baahar kaa aadmi aayegaa wo kamai karegaa yaa pipipi karegaa
 No one will come to invest: Laloo Prasad Yadav, former railway minister has a budget for development
 50 saalon se yojanaayen padi hai puraa nahin hota
 There is a new vision
 pehle ke mantri ghoshnaaen karte the, puraa karne kii chintaa nahin karte thearavishankar prasad, kendriya kanoon mantrirel bajet main 1984 main gwalior-itawa train kii ghoshnaa hui thi
 Train to Mainpuri has not been announced yet
 nitish ne hi sahi kaam kiya tha
 The barrier on the badaun-gajraula line on the Mainpuri route has not yet been cleared
 mere kshetra main sirf 500 meter line banane main sarkaar ko pareshaani he
 The reason for this neglect is political: Mulayam Singh Yadav This railway budget will prove to be speeding the country, speeding the railways, providing security and convenience to the citizens
 railway sirf yatayaat kaa saadhan nahin desh kaa growth ingine he
 This railway budget will prove that the railway plays an important role in the development of the country: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has presented a very good budget
 main pradhanmantri or rail mantri ko badhai dena chahta hum
 The decision to increase rail freight is a difficult decision
 aaj unhone neenv rakhi he
 Like the airport, the talk of connecting the four dhams, high speed train, cleanliness, food, recruitment of women constables is a big thing: While promoting Shahnawaz Hussainigeneration, the government should take full care of reservation of SC-ST-OBC
 ham nijeekaran ke khilaaf nahi hai lekin aarakshan kaa dhyaan rakhe
 Foreign investment is far away
 badi baat puri kahaan hoti he
 The old things do not follow up in every railway budget
 rail mantri ne baaten to badi-badi kii hai lekin ghate main chal rahi railway ko aadhunik karne kaa vaada kaise puraa hoga? pehle ghate se to ubaren
 How will high speed trains run on Route 9 without fixing the tracks? How Bullet trains will go on a loss track: BSP supremo mayawatirailway is a Jersey cow, so Modi government wants to privatize it and 100% FDI to boost black money: Former Railway Minister Dinesh trivedirail budget will benefit common man: Arunendra Kumar, Chairman of Railway Board i don't know What will he give now? inhone haada badhaakar pehle hi bahut de diya he
 These are not good days, bad days: Former railway minister Pawan Bansalham welcomes the idea of bullet train
 lekin yah zyada jaruri he ki mahanagaron se adhik se adhik shaharon ko joda jaaetarik anwar, encipirel bajet se koi ummid nahin:raashid alvimujhe ummid he ki mahangaai kam karne ke liye aapurti kii baadha dur kii jaaegi:jeei dakshin asia ke adhyaksh or mukhya kaaryakari adhikari banmali agarwallogon ko ummid he ki bajet vikaas main teji laaegaa, mahangaai ghataane vaala hoga or rajkoshiya ghaataa kam karne vaala hoga:desh main kepiemji ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari richard rekhibajet main spasht sandesh hona chahie ki bharat kaarobaari gatividhi ke liye khulaa ravaiya rakhata he
 It is anti-corruption and wants to improve the life of the common man: Rajesh Sood, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Max Life Insurance aam aadmi party ke netaa sadak par pradarshan ke saath-saath ab janata kaa samarthan maangate bhi nazar aaenge
 On the one hand, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his minister LG are staging a sit-in at the office, while the Aam Aadmi Party will start a door-to-door campaign from Monday, June 18
 aam aadmi party ke netaa, parshad or vidhayak shaam 4 baje siem awaas ek badi baithak karne ja rahe hai
 Where further strategy will be discussed
 'aap' netaaon ke mutabik, door tu door campan ke dauraan adhikariyon kii hadtaal khatm karaane ke liye 10 lakh logon ke khat ikatthe kiye jaaenge, or wo khat piem narendra modi ko bheje jaaenge
 Let us know that during the door-to-door campaign, the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party will put forth the 3 demands that the CM and the Minister LG are holding inside the office

 While Monday may prove to be an important day for India to make its permanent place in the UN Security Council, China's role in this matter cannot be ignored

 aisa pehali baar hua he ki prastaav main kya likhaa janaa chahie is par alag alag deshon ne likhit suzav die hai
 At the same time, the US, China and Russia did not participate in this process which is seen as an attempt to thwart India's demand for permanent membership
 aaj raat sanyukt raashtra yah tay karegaa ki dastauez par is baatcheet ko aupchaarik rup se or ek saal ke liye badhaayaa ja saktaa he yaa nahin
 But China has strongly opposed the expansion of the Security Council and if China insisted on voting, then India will have to include more countries in the board to carry this dialogue forward

 This draft proposal has been discussed on the next year's agenda of the United Nations, with the theme 'increasing or equal representation in the membership of the Security Council'

 Google on Thursday introduced a service called 'project Fi'
 isaki ghoshnaa google ne do maheene pehle kii thi, jisamen usne smartphone ko wireles conection seva pradaan karne kii apni yojana kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 Google Inc
 is providing basic phone service at $ 20 per month and customers will be charged based on cellular data used every month, rather than a one-time price
 tippaniyan One GB of internet charges will be $ 10 per month
 iskaa arth he graahakon ko aisi yojana mil sakati he jisamen teen jibi data ho or yadi ek maheene main unhone sirf ek jibi istemaal kiya to unhen 20 dollar waapas mil jaaenge
 Most wireless phone companies allow their customers to use inappropriate data in the second month instead of returning money
 project vaay-faay shuruuaat main sirf un bahut kam logon ko bechaa jayega jinke paas nexs-6 ho
 This smartphone is made by Motorola Mobility with the help of Google
 google kii mulya nirdhaaran se ‘project faay’ sabase badi wireles karier varizon, atandty, tii-mobile or spintr ke mukaable sabase sasti yojana he
 It was announced by Google two months ago, in which it revealed its plans to provide wireless connection service to smartphones
 google ink aadharbhoot phone seva 20 dollar prati maah par uplabdh kara rahi he or graahakon se ekamusth keemat ke bajaay har maheene upyog kiye gaye cellular data ke aadhaar par shulk liya jayega
 The comments ek jibi internet kaa shulk 10 dollar prati maah hoga
 This means customers can get a plan that has three GB of data and if they used only one GB in a month, they would get $ 20 back
 zyaadaatar wireles phone companiyaan apane graahakon ko paise waapas karne ke bajaay anupyukt data kaa istemaal duusare maheene main karne kii ijaajat detii hai
 Project y-fi will initially be sold to only a small number of people who have Nexus-6
 is smartphone ko google kii madad se motorola mobility ne banaaya he
 With Google's pricing, 'project Fai' is the cheapest plan compared to the largest wireless carriers Verizon, AT&T, t-mobile and Sprint

 During the hearing of the Ayodhya case in the Supreme Court, the appearance of Kapil Sibal has become a puzzle
 kapil sibbal ne use hal karne kaa daawa to kiya he
 Cleanliness is also given but Riddle's punches remain intact
 ankhmichauli chunki kanoonee he lihaaja itani jaldi khatm hone vaali nahin
 Kapil Sibal himself is a consummate lawyer
 to itane saste main itane bade khel main walkover kaise de sakate hai
 The dispute on the hearing started on the same evening i
e
 December 5
 chah disambar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne gujarat kii chunavi reliyon main kapil sibbal ke kandhe par dhar kar siyaasi nishanebaaji kii
 The Congress too stung
 or sibbal ne jabaan par goyaa taala laga rakhaa tha
 Now intentionally or unknowingly of going to Rama
 puure 48 ghante bitne ke baad sibbal ne chuppi todi
 The 12-page order of the court came in front of the media by shield
 kaha wo upi central sunni vakf board ke vakil nahin bane
 He said what he said in the court as advocates of the parties, Hashim Ansari and Iqbal Ansari
 adaalat ne bhi order main iskaa zikr kiya he
 In this case, when they are speaking, the court order is speaking, then why are the people speaking here and there not silent
 court kii baat court tak hi rahe to behatar he
 Why is it unnecessarily discussed outside
 ye to thi sibbal kii safai
 But will the blot of charges be washed away with such a lot of cleanliness from Tinopal
 kyonki chaar buundon vaala ujaalaa ab tak tokanoon kii kitabomen nahin aayaa he
 Because even the vicious thief leaves evidence somewhere and the law's long hands reach him
 ab court ke aadesh kii padtaal karen to pehle saadhe chah panne bhi is baat kaa saaf zikr karte hai ki kapil sibbal ayodhya se jude mukadmaa sankhya 4192 jisamen upi central sunni vakf board muddai he uske vakil hai
 The name of Kapil Sibal, Senior Advocate, is also recorded on the number of lawyers on record filed by the Waqf Board Advocate on Record Syed Shahid Rizvi in the Chief Justice's Court on December 5
 neeche dastakhat bhi rizvi ke hai
 When Aajtak asked Rizvi to remove the production slip from the court's record, he accepted that the signatures belonged to him
 lekin naam ko lekar unka taalamatol bana rahaa
 He kept on saying that Sibal was not a lawyer for the board
 isaki tasadeeq order ke duusare panne par he
 In which the court has written the case number 2894 and 7226 in front of his name which is recorded on behalf of Hashim Ansari
 ab duusare pahalu par gaur karen to adaalat nesunwaayee kii shuruyatmen hi kah diya tha ki wo mukhya teen pakshakaron ko hi sunegi
 It is also mentioned in the order of the Supreme Court on August 11
 ab teen mukhya pakshakaron menramlala virajman, nirmohi akhaada or sunni central vakf board hai
 Surprisingly, only Kapil Sibal and Rajiv Dhawan kept speaking on behalf of the Muslim side during the hearing that lasted almost two hours
 inamen sibbal mukhya teenon pakshakaron ke vakil nahin hai
 In such a situation, the question also arises that no one has represented the Sunni Waqf Board in such a big case
 jab sibbal ansaari ke vakil the to court ne sibbal ko kis tarah suna
 That is, Sibal gave it clean by rubbing and rubbing
 lekin daag to hai hi
 It is a different matter that both Sibal and BJP feel that if they are stained then what has happened is good

 Night of 1-2 January 2016
 
 
 pathankot airbase par aatanki hamalaa
 After 3 days of operation, the airbase was completely freed from the terrorists
 is oparation main 7 bhartiya javaanon kii jaan gai
 These precious lives could have been saved, had there not been some flaws in the security system of the airbase
 ye khulaasa ek aantarik jaanch report se hua he
 In this report by India Today, it has been clearly said that due to poor planning and security flaws, it became easier for the terrorists to break into the airbase
 bharat-pakistan sarhad ke paas sthit pathankot airbase ko bhartiya vayusena (IAF) kaa agrani base mana jaataa he
 In the midnight of 1-2 January 2016, everyone was shocked by the terrorists making a dent in the security of the airbase
 suraksha khaamiyon par pradhanmantri ne jataai thi naarazgipradhanmantri narendra modi ne hamale kaa gambhirtha se sangyaan lete hue top suraksha adhikariyon ke saath baithak kii
 At the same time, the way the terrorists made a dent in the security of the airbase, expressed deep resentment over it
 pradhanmantri ke sakht rukh ko dekhte hue jaanch kaa aadesh diya gaya
 The IAF had not ordered an inquiry earlier but had to take steps to do so again
 jaanch air vaais-marshall amit dev se karai gai
 The report is understood to have revealed that basic security protocols were not used at the airbase
 report main airbase ke varisht adhikariyon par suraksha main khaamiyon ke liye jimmedaari tay kii gai
 Despite prior warnings, no concrete preparations were made, and the investigation probably reached the conclusion that a detailed plan was not in place for the strong security of the airbase, despite already having clear and accurate intelligence on the attack
 jaanch report main pathankot airbase ke us vakt ke commander air kamador je es dhamun ke naam kaa zikr bhi he
 Air Commodore Dhamun has resigned
 bataa den ki hamale ke do maheene baad air kamador kaa pathankot se transfar kar diya gaya tha, lekin IAF kii jaanch main kai suraksha chukon ke liye sawaalon main aade kii vajah se air kamador dhamun ko sena chhodani padi
 Air Commodore Dhamun was transferred from Pathankot in February 2016
 janvari 2017 main IAF ne unhen neshnal dephence college ke pratishthit course ke liye chunaa gaya
 It was scheduled for Bangladesh this year
 is course ko military seva main oonche kariyar kii seedhi mana jaataa he
 After completing these courses, Dhamun would be entitled to promotion to the post of Air Vice Marshal
 sena ke ucch padasth sutron ne aaj tak ko bataaya ki raksha mantralay ne neshnal dephence college ke liye dhamun ke manonayan par gambhir aapatti jataai thi
 Around the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had expressed concern about the developments related to Pathankot
 ucch padasth sutron ke mutabik kamador dhamun kaa endisi manonayan farvari 2017 main waapas le liya gaya
 After this, an inquiry was ordered regarding Pathankot
 may-june 2017 main aantarik jaanch report main unhen or anya ko airbase par suraksha khaamiyon ke liye jimmedaar mana gaya
 According to high sources, some more IAF officers and jawans may also lose their seniority for not following the prescribed procedure
 airbase ke us vakt ke security officer kii bhi kadi aalochana kii gai he
 a few months ago, there was a security shock, which is the most shocking thing, that the terrorists used the same route to intensify the airbase, which was broken even a few months before the attack
 us vakt dimagi taur par asthir ek shaks airbase kii suraksha ko bhedate hue andar ghusane main kaamyaab hua tha
 According to sources, the incident has been mentioned in the investigation report
 jaanch report main saamne ain suraksha vyavastha kii kai khamiyareport main kaha gaya he ki 2000 acre main faile frontline airbase kii suraksha main kai khamiyaan raheen
 Apart from this, the standard operating procedure (SOP) which is followed for the safety of the installations has also been missed
 isaki vajah se aatankiyon ko airbase main ghusane or phir vahaan khud ko chupaane main kamyaabi mili
 Pointing out the flaws in the report, it said that the trees and grass at the outer security enclosure of the airbase were not pruned
 ghere par guard post kaa sahi rakh-rakhaav nahin tha
 Flood lights used to monitor infiltration were also not functioning properly
 jaanch main ye bhi saamne aayaa ki airbase security un rassiyon kii pahchaan karne main bhi naakaam raheen, jinka istemaal airbase kii diwaar par chadhane ke liye kiya gaya
 Even after the airbase was on high alert, the clue of the terrorist's clothes and leftovers could not be detected
 aantarik jaanch report ke mutabik cmand kaa puraa brakedown dekha gaya
 There was widespread failure to respond to the attack effectively
 yahaan tak ki crack guard commando team aatankiyon ko baadhya nahin kar saki
 When TV Today tried to contact the Ministry of Defense in this context, no response was received
 vayusenadhyaksh ne chitthee main aagaah kiyaaise maheene ke shuru menvayusenadhyakshaare chif marshall bi es dhanoa ne aieef adhikariyon ko sambodhit chitthee main ucch maanakon ke paalan main kotahi, force main peshevraana andaaj kii kami or pakshpaat badhane ko lekar chetavanee di thi
 In the letter sent to 12,000 IAF officers, it was said that there is no place for laxity in the force
 garud commando ko jammu-kashmir main kiya ja rahaa he tainaatbhartiya vayusena ke special daste 'garuda commando' ne pathankot airbase par hue hamale ke dauraan sabase pehle aatankiyon kaa saamana kiya tha
 'garuda Commandos' are now being deployed along with the Indian Army for counter-terrorism operations in Jammu and Kashmir
 ucch sutron ne bataaya, "garud sakasham force he lekin unhen kathin yuddh paristhitiyon ke liye abhyast hona hoga
 Based on the investigation report, the government has decided to deploy Garuda commandos in Jammu and Kashmir
 "farvari 2016 main air kamador dhamun kaa pathankot se transfar hua
 In January 2017, the IAF selected him for the prestigious National Defense College course
 ye is saal bangladesh ke liye nirdhaarit tha
 This course is considered a high career ladder in military service
 ye course puraa karne ke baad dhamun air vaais marshall pad par pronnati ke hakdaar ho jate
 Highly placed sources in the military told Aaj Tak that the Ministry of Defense had raised serious objections to the nomination for the National Defense College
 lagbhag usee samay pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pathankot se jude ghatnakram ko lekar chintaa jaahir kii thi
 The NDC nomination of Kamador Dhamun was withdrawn in February 2017, according to highly placed sources
 iske baad pathankot ko lekar jaanch kaa aadesh diya gaya
 An internal investigation report in may-june 2017 held him and others responsible for security flaws at the airbase
 aantarik jaanch report main un khaamiyon kaa hawala diya gaya he jo pathankot hamale ke dauraan airbase par dikhaai deen
 Accordingly, a complete breakdown of the command was observed
 hamale kaa prabhavi dhang se jawaab dene main vyapak naakaami saamne ai
 Even the crack guard commando team could not compel the terrorists
 let nite party, khubasurat hasinaayen, beli dancers or beintahaa mouj masti, lekin mahanagaron ke is heppaning nite life ke peeche kai baar itnaa andhera hota he ki jab raat guzarati he, to din bhi syah najar aane lagata he
 When the dawn of foreign beauties slaughtered in the morning after some similar nights in the city, the story of crime came to light that the hearsay of the listeners stood up
 let nite party kii jaan banane vaali aisi hi do khubasurat or dilkash videshi hasinaaon kaa katl ho chukaa tha
 a belly dancer from Uzbekistan suddenly disappears every day
 police use dhundne kii tamaam koshish karti he, par wo nahin milti
 Then one day suddenly his body is found
 iske baad katl kii tafteesh shuru hoti he
 After a friend of the Belly dancer, Katilatftish, the police starts searching for a friend of the same Belly dancer by killing him
 magar baad main pataa chalata he ki jise police kaatil maan rahi thi, khud uskaa bhikatlho chukaa he
 Wealth, fame, hatred, deception are all in this plot of double murder woven around a sex racket
 inamen ek ladki shakhanoja kii adhajali laash police ne dilli se dur haryana ke panipat ilaake main ek sunsaan jagah se baraamad kii to, duusari ladki naaj kii laash bhi dilli se baahar upi ke hapur ilaake se mili
 Incidentally, both of these girls mysteriously disappeared from Delhi on the same day, but their bodies were found far away from each other and on different dates
 dilli ke kishangarh main rah rahi shakhanoja 24 sitambar kii raat apane driver ke saath kahin jane ke liye nikali thi, lekin isi bich kuch aisa hua, jo koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 When she reached the South x area, she was abducted by someone
 jis vakt shakhanoja ko agava kiya gaya, vomobile phonpar uzbekistan main maujuud apni maa se baat kar rahi thi or jaise hi uske saath jor-jabardastee hui, usne chillaanaa shuru kar diya
 His scream also reached Uzbekistan thousands of miles away from Delhi
 magar, kuch hi der main mobile phone ke swich of hone kii surat main ye cheekh ghut kar rah gai
 Shakhanoja's mother telephoned her relatives in Delhi to report the incident to her daughter and asked her to find her
 rishtedaaron ne usee vakt dilli police se shikaayat kii, lekin police ne tab maamle ko gambhirtha se nahin liya
 The police had strong clues about the abduction of Shakhanoja as Shakhanoja's mother told her relatives here that the police had also given the names of some of the abducted people and one of them was Shakhanoja's fellow friend and party organizer Naz Atazanova
 lekin iske baavjood police ne tab is maamle main ek adad report tak darj nahin kii
 The negligence of the police was also the cause of death; later in the police, this same Kahili became the cause of death not only of Shakhanoja but also of his friend Naz
 agava kiye jane ke agle din yani 25 sitambar ko panipat police ne shakhanoja kii laash laavaaris haalat main baraamad kii, jabaki hapur police ko iske thik 11 din baad yani 6 oktober ko naaj kii laash bhi gumnaam haalat main mili
 Troubled over the kidnapping of her daughter, her mother arrived in Delhi directly from Uzbekistan and after a series of rounds from the police station to the DCP office, the Kotla Mubarakpur police finally registered a report of the abduction of Shakhanoja on 8 October
 apharan ke chand ghanto baad mili lashudhar, apharan kiye jane ke chand ghante baad hi dilli-haryana border par kaatilon ne shakhanoja kaa naa sirf galaa ghont kar katl kar diya, balki laash ko ek suutakes main daal kar panipat main jala bhi diya
 The Haryana police treated Shakhanoja's body as an unclaimed corpse and conducted her post-mortem and laid the viscera and cremated her
 shakhanoja kii maa ne police ko bataaya ki uski beti ko agava karne waalon main naaj ke saath-saath gagan naam kaa ek shaks bhi apane kuch doston ke saath shaamil tha
 Among them, Gagan and the rest of the friends came in front of the police and defied all the charges of the family of Shakhanoja, but Naz never came forward
 police ne jab-jab gagan se shakhanoja or naaj ke bare main poocha, gagan police ko bataata rahaa ki donon apni marji se hi kahin chali gai hai
 When more than 50 days had passed, the two girls did not know anything, so far the police, taking the matter lightly, came down on Gagan strictly and just here Gagan told one such thing that the ground under police's feet Slipped usne bataaya ki shakhanoja ke katl main naaj bhi uske saath shaamil thi, lekin vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad vahiin kahin or bhaag gai
 In this way, the police had solved the case of kidnapping and killing of the first girl, Shakhanoja, but she was still looking for Naaz, who had been missing since the day she was kidnapped
 sex racket kaa khulhasisi bich police ko shakhanoja ke gharavaalon ne ek aisa khat haath laga, jisane naaj kii gumshudagi kii sari kahani palat di
 This letter written in Uzbek language was from Naz
 khat main likhaa tha, ' hindustan aane ke baad se lagaataar gagan meraa shoshan kar rahaa he
 He is presenting me to big and rich people
 main uske sex racket main buree tarah funs chuki hum
 If something happens to me, Gagan will be responsible for it
 'paison kaa len- dein maut kii vajahpahale katl ke khulaase ke thik teen din baad gagan ne doosraa khulaasa kiya
 Gagan said that he had also burnt his body in Hapur after killing Naz on 5 October
 gagan ne police ko bataaya ki shakhanoja ko naaj se 8 lakh rupye milane the
 Naaz could not give this money and this rupee became the reason for the enmity between the two
 shakhanoja ne naaj kaa passport girvee rakhwa kar kuch jewelri kii khariddaari kar lee thi or shakhanoja ke apharan ke roj donon ne use maamla saital karne ke liye hi bulaayaa tha
 But after this the situation became such that Gagan first murdered Shakhanoja with Naz and then deceitfully killed Naz too
