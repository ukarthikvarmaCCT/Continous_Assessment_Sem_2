 This is Dhoni's 7th Man of the Series award in the One Day International Series
 melbern main dhoni ne 114 gend khelte hue chah chauke kii madad se naabad 87 ran kii pari kheli jabaki jadhav ne 57 gend main saat chauke se naabad 61 ran banaae
 India needed 33 runs in the last four overs to win
 dhoni or jadhav ne 47wein over main chah ran, 48wein over main 13 ran or 49wein over main 13 ran jutaaye
 This required only one run to win in the last over, and Jadhav hit the second ball of it to give the team victory
 aise main unki vaapasi kii vakaalat karne vaale purv saansad or varisht netaa raghuvansh prasad singh ko bhi unhone chetavanee di he ki bhavishya main aise logon kaa samarthan karne se baaj aae
 a few days ago Pappu Yadav announced that he was going to Ranchi where he would meet RJD President Lalu Yadav but Tejashwi was upset that Pappu had publicized the news in the media that Lalu Yadav called him Ranchi Which was far from the facts
 haalanki naa pappu ranchi gayi or naa hi ye mulaaqaat hui
 The comments tejasvi yadav ke bayaan ke baad filhal pappu yadav kii ghar vaapasi asambhav dikhti he
 Pappu's problem is that in today's date, Yadav and Muslim voters will probably give RJD to someone other than Congress
 pichhali baar pappu rajd ke tikat par chunaav jite lekin jeetne ke baad unhone lalu yadav se hi 'takaraana' shuru kar diya
 Later he also formed his own party and fielded candidates in the assembly elections but everyone had to face defeat
 VIDEO- lalu ji jald hi baahar aaenge: rabari devi Pappu hoped that he would become the leader of the Yadavas after Lalu, but in front of Tejashwi, he also realized that people would not listen to him
 lekin, tejasvi kii chetavanee ke baad nishchit rup se raghuvansh or shivanand tiwari jaise netaaon ko aane vaale samay main ek sanket mil gaya hai ki tejasvi se bina puche pappu or anand mohan kii pairvi karne kaa koi faaydaa nahin
 After the statement of Tejashwi Yadav, the return of Pappu Yadav to the house seems unlikely
 pappu kii samasya he ki aaj kii tarikh main yadav or muslim voter rajd congress ke alaava shaayad kisi duusare ko degaa
 The last time Pappu won elections on RJD ticket, but after winning, he started 'colliding' with Lalu Yadav
 baad main unhone apni party bhi banaayi or vidhansabha chunaav main ummidavaar bhi utaare lekin sabko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 VIDEO- Lalu ji will be out soon: Rabri Devi pappu ko ummid thi ki wo lalu ke baad yadavon ke netaa ban jaaen lekin vahaan tejasvi ke saamne unhen bhi andaaza ho gaya he ki log unki nahin sunne vaale
 But, after Tejashwi's warning, surely leaders like Raghuvansh and Shivanand Tiwari have got a clue in the coming years that there is no use to defend Pappu and Anand Mohan without asking Tejashwi
 VIDEO- lalu ji jald hi baahar aaenge: rabari devi Pappu hoped that he would become the leader of the Yadavas after Lalu, but in front of Tejashwi, he also realized that people would not listen to him
 lekin, tejasvi kii chetavanee ke baad nishchit rup se raghuvansh or shivanand tiwari jaise netaaon ko aane vaale samay main ek sanket mil gaya hai ki tejasvi se bina puche pappu or anand mohan kii pairvi karne kaa koi faaydaa nahin

 Do not forget even on the day of Akshaya Tritiya, what to do on the day of Akshaya Tritiya: -1
 sukh shanti:11 gomti chakron ko laal reshmi vastra main baandhakar chaandi kii dibbi main rakhkar puja sthaan main rakhane se ghar main sadaiv sukh-shanti kaa vaataavaran bana rahata he

 With this experiment, the bad luck of the seeker ends in a few days
 pitru-dosha se mukti ke liye:jin jaatakon kii janmpatrika main 'pitru-dosha' he ve 'akshay-tritiya' ke din praat:kaal kisi svachh sthaan yaa mandir main lage pipal ke upar apane pitruganon ke nimitt ghar kaa bana mishthan va ek matki main shuddh jal rakhen
 Pray for the satisfaction of your ancestors by lighting a sun-lamp under the Peepal
 tatpashchaat bina peeche dekhe sidhe apane ghar laut aaen, dhyaan rakhen is prayog ko karte samay anya kisi vyakti kii drushti naa paden

 Arvind Kejriwal rallied in Farrukhabad, grabbed Salman Khurshid, the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of UP, accusing them of having met and said that Salman Khurshid stole money for the disabled and should be arrested immediately
 salmaan khurshid ke sansadeey kshetra farrukhabad main arvind kejariwal ne raily se pehle hi hangaamaa ho gaya or kejariwal samarthakon or congress samarthakon main jhadap ho gai
 In fact, the police stopped the participation of Congress workers in Kejriwal's rally
 apane sambodhan ke dauraan kejariwal ne sabase pehle logon se yah nivedan kiya ki wo hinsa kaa rukh nahin apanaayen
 Kejriwal said, 'I belong to Salman Camp, i belong to Kejriwal Camp
 yah galat he
 Those who want to protest must do it and come and talk
 ’kejariwal ne kaha, ‘mujhe kuch 20-25 logon ne kaale jhande dikhaaye aaj
 i think how Khurshid will win this seat with only these 25 people
 ’iske baad kejariwal ne salmaan khurshid par lagaae apane aaropon ko doharaate hue kaha, ‘jitna paisa salmaan khurshid ke enjio ko diya gaya tha wo sabhi chori ho gaya
 Attacking Khurshid, Kejriwal said, "he was the country's law minister
" inhone apni patni ke saath milakar sara paisa chori kar liya or jab hamane viklangon ke saath pradhanmantri ji se milane kii koshish kii to milane nahin diya gaya
 Policemen arrested us, citing threats to the Prime Minister's safety from the 60-70 disabled
 ’unhone pradhanmantri par hamalaa karte hue kaha, ‘ye pradhanmantri jise 60-70 viklangon se dar lagata he wo desh bhala kya chalaayegaa
 We demand the resignation of the Prime Minister who is afraid of 60 disabled people
 ’arvind kejariwal ne kaha, ‘hamaari maang he salmaan khurshid ke khilaaf exiaar darj ho or unhen giraftaar kiya jaae
 'kejriwal said,' We thought that we go to Farrukhabad and meet their owner
 inhone vakeelon kaa paisa churaayaa
 This man steals by killing their right
 kisi bhi viklangon ko yahaan se khadaa karke jitayaa jaae
 'kejriwal said,' After this came Salman's statement 'now i will write with blood'
 unhone kaha ki main sonia ji ke liye jaan de saktaa hum
 i used to think that they can die for the country
 ek aurat ke liye jaan dena
 But after this scam, he benefited and was made the foreign minister
 ’kejariwal ne akhilesh yadav ko bhi ghere main lete hue kaha, ‘akhilesh kya jaanch kar rahe hai wo to sirf lipapoti kar rahe hai
 Chor chor mausare bhai wali is the saying
 ye inako yahaan bachaayenge wo unako vahaan sibiai se bachaayenge
 Quoting a June 12 report of the Uttar Pradesh government, Kejriwal said, "this is a report made by Akhilesh Yadav
 ye us jaanch se sambandhit he jo salmaan khurshid ke trust se sambandhit he or mayawati ke kaarykaal main shuru hui thi
 What is written in this report is signed by the District Disabled Welfare Officer
 ’kejariwal ne kaha, ‘sabhi mili hai
 Why is Sonia Rahul silent? ’ unhone aage kaha, ‘sabhi partiyaan mili hui hai
 Now the socialist government is there but Mayawati will not go to jail
 kya mulaayam singh gaye the jab mayawati mukhyamantri thim?’kejariwal ne kaha, ‘maine dilli main logon ke ghar jaakar unki kaati gai bijli conection ko joda or kai logon ne khud hi apana conection jod liya
 i tried this to get fear out of people's minds
 ’ 2014 ke chunaavon main meri party kii agar thodi bhi chali to or hamane kuch karnama kar diya to tay maniye ki in sabhi khulaason par karrwai kii jaaegi or chah maheene ke baad in sabhi ghotalebaajon ko salaakhon ke peeche bheja jayega

 Mahatma Gandhi also used to do politics and it was in the form of public service
 kejariwal ne kaha, ‘abhi ek or khulaasa karne vaale hai ki pani ke daam kyon bade

 Chandrababu Naidu on Friday accused the Kirendra Modi government of trying to destabilize his government

 jabaki pradesh ke bantwaare ke badatidipisarkaar ne janata se jo vaade kiye the, use puure kar rahi he
 He said that TDP will play an important role in every protest against the policies of the Modi government
 hamane yojana bani lee he ki centre sarkaar ke dwaara kii jane vaali har karrwai kaa saamana kaise karnaa he
 Naidu appealed to his activists to bring the nexus of BJP and TRS to the people of the state and expose it democratically
 bataa den ki andhra pradesh ke liye vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang ko lekar tidipi ne bijepi ke netritv vaale endie gathbandhan se naata tod liya tha
 Since then, the tdp's stance has been tough against the Modi government
 jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main donon partiyaan milakar chunaav ladi thim
 The TDP ministers were also included in the Modi government
 tidipi or bijepi main bigade sambandhon ke peeche mukhya vajah andhra ke liye vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang he
 The Modi government initially indicated that the Metro Rail project for Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam could be approved along with providing financial assistance for the development of Andhra Pradesh
 tidipi kii maang thi ki modi sarkaar us vaade ko puraa kare jo andhra pradesh ke bantwaare ke dauraan tatkaaleen sarkaar ne kiya tha
 On the other hand, the central government is not accepting tdp's demand for special state status because any state will have to change the rules to grant special state status
 agar niyamon main badlaav kar tidipi kii maang maan lee jaae to bihar, jharkhand jaise anya rajya bhi is tarah kii maang kar modi sarkaar kii mushkilen badha sakate hai
 Therefore, the Modi government is not ready to bow down to the TDP demand at any cost

 Akhilesh Yadav could not understand the cleverness of Mayawati after seeing the way the seats were split between SP and BSP in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha elections
 enditivi ne 4 march 2019 ko hi siton kaa vishleshan kar andaja lagaaya gaya tha ki sapa kii kya haalat ho sakati he
 It was said in the report that BSP supremo Mayawati has beaten SP president Akhilesh Yadav in the seat sharing
 shaayad is halaat ko sapa ke sabase varisht netaa mulaayam singh yadav bhaanp gaye the
 This is the reason why he spoke about the incorrect distribution of tickets

 The SP was given many seats where the combined vote of the SP-BSP was not worth winning any candidate
 varanasi, lakhanu, kanpur or gajiabad aisi hi siten thim
 These seats were already believed that the alliance candidate would not win
 mayawati ne man mutabik siten le leen
 From the tone of exchange of votes, SP was second in 2014 in the 10 seats where the BSP has won
 isi kaaran sapa ko asafalataa mili
 The equations were in favor of SP on Nagina, Bijnor, Shravasti, Ghazipur seats
 doosraa kaaran gathbandhan kii camestry jameen tak nahin pahunchi
 Seeing the crowd in the meetings, he felt that our votes would be transferred to each other

 Akhilesh had aligned with Congress in the 2017 assembly elections, which also suffered defeat at that time
 ab loksabhaa chunaav main bhi gathbandhan kaam nahin aayaa
 It was here that Mayawati knew that SP had a good hold on Muslim voters because of Mulayam
 iskaa phayda mayawati ko hua

 The same title has been given in the report of 'caravan' magazine highlighting the exploits of National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval and his sons Vivek and Shaurya
 saal do saal pehle hindi ke channel daaud ko bharat laane ke kai propeganda program karte the, unamem dobhaal ko nayak kii tarah pesh kiya jaataa tha
 Who would have thought that 'caravan' magazine, which published 27 reports on the death of Judge Loya, would give Doval the title of 'D' Company in January 2019
 kaushal shroff naam ke ek khoji patrkaar ne america, england, singapore or caman island se dastauez jutakar dobhaal ke beton kii company kaa khulaasa kiya he
 According to 'caravan' magazine, these companies fall under hedge funds and offshore
 tex hewan vaali jagahon main company kholane kaa matlab hi he ki sandigdhta kaa prashn aa jaataa he or naitikta kaa bhi

 In 2011, Ajit Doval wrote a report that action should be taken on the grounds of tax evasion and his own son's name appears in the case of hedge funds and companies doing business in such places

 aisi kai farzi companiyon ke lakhon dastauez jab li hue the, to 'indian express' ne bharat main paradise papers ke naam se chapa tha
 Prior to this, the fraud was created in the name of Panama Papers by creating fake companies in the name of investment
 paradise papers or panama papers donon main hi walkers corporate limited kaa naam he, jo vivek dobhaal kii company kii sangrakshak company he
 'caravan' has written in its report that many officers working in Vivek Doval's company also work in Shaurya Doval's company
 iskaa matlab yah hua he ki koi bahut bada financial network chal rahaa he
 His company is also related to the company of the royal family of Saudi Arabia

 And many times the rumored people manage to trick the public till they get to the bottom of the news case
 ayodhya vivaad par supreme court main sunwaayee ke aakiri din bhi kuch aisa hi hua
 The rumor market started spreading in the morning and early morning that the Sunni Waqf Board set the example of brotherhood in the case of Ayodhyaism, dispute 2
 77 acre zamin par daawa chhod diya he
 This was surprising because after several attempts of the arbitration panel, he had told the court that all the exercise of the agreement proved to be useless
 lekin afvahabaazon ne to formula tak pesh kar diya tha ki vaqf board ne ayodhya kii jameen chhodane ke badale main kaashi,mathuraka daawa chhodane kii hindu paksh se maang kii he or ASI ke qabze vaali masjidon main namaaz padhaaye jane kii manzuri chaahi he
 The Ghat in Ayodhya city, however, the Waqf Board did not put any such affidavit in front of the court
 balki zafaryaab jilani ne saafe-saafe kah diya ki suni vaqf board kii taraf se samjhaute kii disha main aisa kuch nahin kaha gaya he
 a report was made to the court from the arbitration panel
 afawaah gang ne phir ye kah kar baat ko sanbhaalane kii koshish kii ki vaqf board kaa wo formula madhyasthon ko hi sujhaayaa gaya tha
 The rumor increased in Ayodhya
 These rumors increased the heat in both the camps in Ayodhya
 ram janmabhumiper mandir dekhne kii chaah rakhane waalon ne ek duusare ko badhaaiyaan tak dena shuru kar diya or muslim paksh se jude logon ke phone ghanaghnane lage, kahin iqbaal ansaari ne to samjhaute kii hami nahin bhar di, kahin haji mehboob to haa nahin kar aae
 Swami Karpatri, associated with the Saryu Nadiram Janmabhoomi temple movement in Ayodhya, who is known for his tantrums, says that the time has come to truly liberate the souls of all those who have sacrificed their lives for the Ram temple
 
 bijepi se judi subuhi khan, tripal talaaq ke baad ab ram mandir ke maamle main bhi, musalamaanon ke bheetar ek raay qaayam karne main lagi hui hai
 Subuhi says that if the Ayodhya dispute was decided by the court, then the foreheads of the Muslims of this country would remain forever stained that they did not leave any room for their Hindu brothers, Adhashree Ram
 jawaab main jamiya main biochemistry padhaa rahe shoeb jamaai kehete hai ki daag to bijepi or hindu sanghathanon ke maathe laga he,samvidhanki hatya or ayodhya ke dhaanche ko giraane kaa
 The beauty of Ayodhya on the expectations of common people is that it does not change its nature even among such arguments - sophists, rumors and rhetoric
 sarayuke ghaaton par jam kar saafe-safaai chaalu he
 Construction work is going on on a war footing at Ram's paadi
 diwali jo aa rahi he
 There is only one occasion of the year, in which every person leaves lazily and gets involved in cleaning the house
 phir ayodhya to ram kii nagari he
 With the hope of ending the 134-year exile of Rama, the expectations of common people are also rising

 Team India, who had lost the first match of the three-match ODI series against Bangladesh, are still fresh and the middle-order batsman of the team Suresh Raina has insisted that India is still a better team than Bangladesh
 raina ne kaha ki team india pehla match ganvaane ke baad siries main vaapasi karegi
 Bangladesh won the first match by 79 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the series
 raina ne kaha, ‘yah haar hamaare liye stabdh karne vaali thi or isse kaaphi dukh pahunchaa
 Yes, they played better than us but we are still a better team
 unke cricket main din ba din sudhaar ho rahaa he lekin ham alag str par hai
 "will have to give full strength to come back" The left-handed batsman hit a 40-ball 40 while chasing a target of 308 runs
 unhone kaha ki mejabaan team ne unhen koi mauka nahin diya
 Raina said, 'we did not play well
 lekin do or match bache hai or majboot vaapasi karne ke liye hamen apni puri energy jhonkani hogi
 a defeat does not make us a bad team
 jaisaa ki ravi (shastri) ne hamaare se kaha ki ham kis tarah vaapasi karte hai yah hamaare jazbe ko dikhayega
 "mustafizur-taskin Revenge Match Stance" Given India's strong batting order, Raina feels that the target could have been achieved
 bharat ne thos shuruyaat kii lekin iske baad niyamit antaraal par wicket ganvaane ke kaaran team 228 ran par dher ho gai
 Raina said, "we should have achieved this target especially given the strength of our batting order

 He said, 'after this, apart from the partnership between Ravindra Jadeja and me, we could not have any good partnership
 isse hamen nuksaan hua
 "mustafizur has not changed habit, will be upset" Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman were fined on Friday for violation of ICC code of conduct
 raina se jab poocha gaya ki kya debyue kar rahaa yah gendbaaj ballebaajon ke raste main aakar dhyaan bhang kar rahaa tha to unhone kaha, ‘agar iske kaaran hamaara koi ballebaaj ran out ho jaataa to yah galat hota
 He first collided with Rohit Sharma and then MS Dhoni
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘kisi ko bhi gambhir chot lag sakati thi
 He will have to learn to stay away from the pitch while the batsmen take runs
 ampiron ko is bare main usase baat karne kii jarurat he
 If he did not change this habit it would be very difficult for him

 CM wrote on Twitter that Somnath is now causing embarrassment to the party
 siem kejariwal ne buudhvaar subah twitor par likhaa, 'somnath ko sarendorkar dena chahie
 Why are they running? Why is he afraid of going to jail? Now he is causing embarrassment to the party and his family
 unhen police ke saath sahyog karnaa chahie
 'somnath shud surrender
 Why is he running away?why is he so scared of gng to jail? Now he is becoming embarasment for party n his family(1 / 2)— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)september 23, 2015he shud cooperate wid police(2 / 2)— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)september 23, 2015somnath bharti kii patni lipika mitra ne kejariwal ke twit par unka aabhaar jataayaa he
 Apparently Kejriwal's tweet has almost made it clear that the party has distanced itself from the domestic affairs of Sosomnath Bharati
 aise main somnath bharti ke liye mushkilen or bad sakati hai
 Significantly, after the petition was rejected by the High Court on Tuesday, Delhi Police reached his house to arrest him, but Somnath did not meet him at his house
 dwarka police ne somnath ke bare main unke bhai-bahan or do sambandhiyon se bhi poochtacha kii
 No surrender till the matter is decided in SC: In an exclusive conversation with Somnath India Today, Somnath said that he will not surrender until the matter is decided by the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha, 'buudhvaar ko mere vakil supreme court jaaenge
 i will take the next step only after the decision from the Supreme Court
 dilli police raajnneetik dabaav main aakar mere khilaaf kaam kar rahi he
 Its main purpose is to arrest and discredit me
 'gharelu hinsa maamle main aaropee AAP vidhayakane dilli kii sthaneey adaalat ke us faisle kaa virodh karte hue hai court main yachika daayar kii thi, jisamen unhen giraftaar karne ke liye gaiyr jamaanti warrant jari kiya gaya tha
 After this, the Delhi High Court gave relief to him and also stayed his arrest
 isse pehle unhone jamaanat ke liye dwarka court main arji lagaai thi
 Somnath Bharti has been charged with serious charges including domestic violence by his wife Lipika Mitra
 chennai superkings ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ne pehle kwalifire main royal chalangers bangalore ko haraakar ipel final ke liye kwalifai karne ke baad kaha ki unhen is jeet kaa shat-pratishat bharosa nahin tha
 RCB batted first and scored 175 for four, in response to which the Chennai team recovered from a poor start to win by six wickets thanks to an unbeaten 73-run stand by Suresh Raina
 dhoni ne match ke baad kaha, yah mushkil lakshya tha, lekin ham pehle bhi aise halaat kaa saamana kar chuke hai or hamen vishwaas tha ki ham is tarah kii paristhitiyon main jeet sakate hai
 He said, we believe in ourselves that we can do this
 lekin aap kah sakate hai ki mujhe shat-pratishat bharosa nahin tha
 As a team we know that we can achieve any goal
 dhoni ne raina ne alaava unke saath sirf teen over main naabad 46 ran kii saajhedaari karne vaale albi morkal kii bhi jamkar tarif kii
 Morkel scored an unbeaten 28 off 10 balls
 dhoni ne kaha, raina ne behtareen ballebaaji kii, lekin antim overon main morkal kii ballebaaji bejod thi
 On the other hand, Bangalore captain Daniel Vettori said that Raina snatched the match from him
 unhone kaha, hamane acha khelaa dikhaaya
 We were in good shape, but after that Raina took the match away from us
 ham haalanki thodi behatar gendbaaji kar sakate the
 Vettori, however, is relieved that despite this defeat, his team is not out of the tournament and will get another chance to make it to the finals
 main of da match raina ne kaha ki vah 20wein over tak khilne ke lakshya ke saath utre the
 He said, it was an important match for us
 hamane apni ranneetiyon ko bakhubi anjaam tak pahunchaaya
 i wanted to bat till the 20th over and was successful in it
 saal 2014 kii film 'khubasurat' ke baad se hi fawaad khan ne meri najaron ke jariye mere dil main entry maar lee thi
 i am not the only one who has a crush on Jupiter's size on Fawad
 is list main meri bahan se lekar meri maa, offis main meri bos or yahaan tak ki mere paaltu dogi kii doctor bhi shaamil he
 Fawad Khan is the sexiest man alive on the timeline of all my friends from Facebook to Twitter
 meri bahan ne to had hi kar di
 Recently his computer crashed, then said 'fawad had downloaded some photos
 
 
 ab wo he hi itnaa hot ki computer krash hona hi tha
 Thinking aside the bawalas at the time of the release of the film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil', the truth is that neither the talent sees the border nor the crush
 ajpvaad35 ke puure ho gaye
 What if i am only 25? Do not measure madness by age, sir
 'jindagi' channel ke tivi serial 'jindagi gulzaar he' ke pehle episod se main fawaad ko follow kar rahi hum
 And if i tell God true, i want a similar boy in real life who looks royal
 favaasapane munh se alfaaz na bhi nikaalen, apana koi poj yaa style na bhi dikhaaen, to bhi unke chehre se ek roylty jhalkati he
 As if prince of a sultanate! Talking about career, Fawad may have worked in half a dozen films, 3-4 television films and about a dozen TV serials, but his winning awards list is reaching the figure of 20, including a filmfare
 
 jab se pataa chalaa kifvaad actorhone ke alaava singer bhi hai or guitar va drums bhi bajaate hai- tab se to 'mainnu vi ainnadaai munda chida e'
 Papa and Mummy are also starting to find a relationship for me
 plis fawaad aap bura mat maananaa lekin hamaari old generation abhi bhi jaat-dharm or hindustan-pakistan ke bich ke antar ko gale main sajaae baithi he
 But i have thoroughly tested all your strengths and have given that list to my father
 ab wo mere liye aisa ladkaa hi dhundhenge jisamen aap jaisi khubiyaan hi hon, jaise:- wo aapaki tarah shant ho lekin charming aisa ki ghode par baithe to sapanom main aane vaale rajkumaar jaisaa lage
 - He should be 'one Woman Man' and be caring for the entire family along with me
 - uski image bilkul clin ho or wo jhagade-fasaadon se dur rahata ho
 - It should have perfect dressing sense along with Rajputana styles
 khayr ab aap to shaadishuda ho or mere gharavaale bhi kisi pakistani se meri shaadi nahin karaane vaale
 But on the anniversary of your birthday, just to say that you have a fan across the border who dies on your skills and skills as well as your looks, your style and your simplicity
 is fain ke liye jaat-dharm kii koi diwaar nahin he
 This fan is still angry about the dispute between two countries
 yah fain aaj bhi maanati he ki agar ye do desh pehle jaise ek hote, to hunar kii taadaad kitni zyada hoti
 Then maybe you are also a fan of this! happy Birthday

 (input language) modi cabinet ne di air india ke vinievesh kii saidhantik manjuuri Delhi is so eagerly waiting for rain
 barish ne jaraa si dastak bhi di lekin dilliwaalon kaa dilli kii sadakon ne bhi dil kholkar swaagat kiya he
 All the roads of Delhi were disturbed after heavy rains on Wednesday
 jagah jagah sadakon par gadhde ho gaye hai or isaki vajah se accident kaa khatra bhi bad gaya he
 Roads considered to be busy in terms of traffic are also looking bad
 sabase pehle ring road kii baat karte hai
 It is not only a major and heavy traffic road of Delhi, but it is also called the lifeline of Delhi
 is sadak par jagah jagah gadde ho gaye hai
 In many places the road has become so bad that traffic jams have also started
 ashram ke paas nehru nagar ke paas vaala hissaa puri tarah seubad khabadaho gaya he
 Here the road has been uprooted from a large part in many places
 yahaan se thodi hi duuri par lajpat nagar kii taraf fliover utarate hi kaaron or duusare baari vaahanon kaa saamana bade-bade gaddhon se ho rahaa he
 Surprisingly, the road has been ravaged for many days but it has not been repaired and now the situation is getting worse from bad due to rain
 jawahar laal nehru stadium ke paas trephic signal par sadak par ek bada gaddha kisi haadase kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 Here on the road leading to the defense colony, there is a pit about half a feet deep and three to four feet in length
 jisamen pani bhar jane ke baad yah or bhi khatarnaak najar aa rahaa he
 It is noteworthy that both these roads are under the PWD of Delhi Government and it is not that the Government is not aware of this
 jab aaj tak ne dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se dilli kii sadakon par gaddhon ke bare main sawaal kiya to unhone kanni jarur kaati, lekin kaha ki wo garh ko thik kara rahe hai
 It is not only the roads that come under the Delhi government are decaying
 lutian jone jaise viipi ilaake kii sadakon kii haalat bhi kharaab he
 Tughlaq Road is completely filled with small pits after Lok Kalyan metro station
 barish ke baad sadak kii haalat itani khasta haal he ki basen or kaaren hichkole kha rahi hai
 The same situation is with MCD roads
 haalanki dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari kehete he ki emsidi kii sadakon par gaddhen hai jarur lekin unki haalat dilli sarkaar kii sadakon se kahin behatar he
 It is obviously the beginning of rain, but the roads have welcomed the way
 use dekhakar lagata he ki gadhdhon ko bharne main sarkaar ko khaasi mashkkat kerani padegi
 The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has decided to run additional buses on some routes in the city in view of the huge rush of devotees at the Navratri festival
 ditisi ek adhikari ne bataaya ki ye basen chhatarpur mandir, kalkaji mandir or jhandevalaan mandir ke liye root sankhya 450 or 516 par chalaai jaaengi
 For the convenience of the passengers, these buses will be run in the evening time
 unhone bataaya ki yatriyon kii madad karne ke liye sabhi ahm sthanon par ditisi trephic suparvising staff tainaat kiya jayega
 Even in the case of Love Jihad, there has been a ruckus in the whole country
 lekin in sab ke bichbollywood kii khubasurat actress karinakpur ne kaha he ki wo lav jehad main yakeen nahin rakhti hai
 i just believe in love
 karina ne apane pati saf ali khan se apane rishton ke bare main kaha ki wo behad khule vichaaron vaale hai
 He has also shared his perspective on Love Jihad through an open letter
 saf ne ek hindu ladki se shaadi kii or jaisaa sabhi ko pataa he ki hamane court main shaadi kii
 Kareena said, 'I think love is something that you cannot define
 isamen ek junun, lalak or bahut si chijen hoti hai
 It can happen between two humans
 ab agar ek hindu ladkaa he or vah kisi muslim ladki se pyaar karne lagata he, to aap unhen roak nahin sakate
 You cannot love anyone by asking whether you are Hindu or Muslim? Bebo said, 'love is a feeling
 yahi vajah he ki main lav jihad main yakeen nahin rakhti
 i believe in feelings of love
 karina kii agali film 'bajrangi bhaijan' bhi ek brahman ladki or muslim ladke kii prem kahani he
 Kabir Khan's film also stars Salman Khan

 This is the first time for Team India to give a winning gift to their country on the occasion of Independence Day
 yani swatantraaa prapti ke baad jo kabhi nahin hua, wo viraat brigade karne ke liye taiyaar he
 Actually, on the current tour of the West Indies, Team India will take off for the last match of the ODI series on 14 August
 mana ja rahaa he ki shaam 7 baje (IST) se shuru hone vaale is nirnaayak match kaa nateeja bhartiya samyaanusaar aadhi raat ke baad hi aayega, jab calendar main taarikh badal chuki hogi or 15 agast shuru ho chukaa hoga
 The Indian team will not only win the ODI series 2–0 at the Queens Park Oval ground in Port of Spain, but for the first time it is a chance to convey the good news of victory to the countrymen on 15 August
 bhartiya team ne swatantraaa diwas ke din antarrashtriya cricket match kam hi khele hai
 So far she has played international cricket five times on August 15, and all these have been Test matches
 vanade interneshal kii baat karen, to aisa duusari baar hoga jab 14 agast ko bhartiya team maidan par hogi
 Earlier, on 14 August 1993, India faced Sri Lanka in Moratua, but then they were defeated by 4 wickets
 aaie jaanate hai 15 agast ko team india kab-kab test match khel chuki he-- 15-18 agast 1936, viruddh england- ovelingland 9 wicket se jeeta- 14-19 agast 1952, viruddh england- ovelmatch drow- 14-17 agast 2001, viruddh srilanka- gallesrilanka 10 wicket se jeeta-15-17 agast 2014, viruddh england- ovelingland pari or 244 ranon se jeeta-12-15 agast 2015, viruddh srilanka- gallesrilanka 63 ranon se jitaganatantr diwas (26 janvari): team india ne khele hai ye vanade, tii-20ganatantr diwas (26 janvari) kii baat karen, to is din 1986 main edilade main australia ke khilaaf vanade main bharat ko 36 ranon se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 On 26 January 2000, India was defeated by Australia by 152 runs in the Adelaide ODI on 26 January 2000, while on the same day in 2015, Sydney ODI against Australia was inconclusive
 26 janvari 2016 ko tii-20 international main bharat ne edilade main australia ko 37 ranon se haraaya tha
 The following year (2017), on January 26, Team India lost to England by 7 wickets in Kanpur
 kabhi khud ko bahujan samaaj party supremeo mayawati kaa betaa bataane vaale bhim army pramukh chandrashekhar aaazaad kaa ab un par hi hamalavar ho gaye hai
 In the run-up to the ongoing Lok Sabha elections in the country, Chandrasekhar on Sunday targeted Mayawati and said that the BSP, not the bsp's well-wisher of Dalits, is my party (bhima Army)
 bataa den ki chandrashekhar ravivaar ko baba sahib doctor bhimrao ambedkar kii 128veen jayanti ke avasar par unki janmasthali mau main unki pratimaa par pushpanjali arpit karne pahunche the
 During this time he gave this statement
 baba sahib ke sapanom ko puraa karungamau main ambedkar pratimaa pushpanjali arpit karne aae chandrashekhar ne kaha, ‘baba sahib ne kuch bade-bade sapane dekhe the, jo ab tak puure nahin hue hai
 That's why i have come here and i will fulfill these dreams of him
 ’ saath hi unhone kaha, ‘mayawati kii party daliton ke hiton kii raksha nahin karti he
 Actually my party (bhim Army) is the well wisher of Dalits all over the country, not the BSP
 ’aaj baba sahib ambedkar ke janmasthan mau madhyapradesh jaakar naman kiya,baba sahib ke prabud bharat ke sapane ko saakaar karne hi bhim army kaa antim lakshya he jiske liye ham sab prayasarat he

 com / mpb5bdb6fr — Chandra Shekhar Aazad (@bhimarmychief) April 14, 2019 Who is the name of Chandrashekhar Azadbheem Army's founder Chandrashekhar Azad came to light in May 2017 in Shabbirpur, Saharanpur in the ethnic clash between Dalits and Rajputs
 is ghatana ke baad june 2017 main hi chandrashekhar kii giraftaar hui or un par yogi sarkaar ne rasuka lagaaya tha
 Chandrashekhar came out of jail after getting bail from the court in November 2018 and he has been active since then
 chandrashekhar Vs mayawatichandrashekhar aaazaad samay-samay par khud ko daliton kaa sabase bada netaa bataane kii koshish karte rahe hai
 On April 2 last year, during the 'bharat Bandh' of Dalits, he also registered his activism
 iske alaava bhi kai maukon par wo khud ko upi main daliton ke jhukaav vaali mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party kaa hitaishi bataane kii koshish karte dikhe hai
 On the other hand, Mayawati called him an 'agent' of the BJP
 is bich chandrashekhar ne elaan kiya tha ki vah pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf uttar pradesh kii varanasi loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladenge
 Explain that Chandrashekhar is considered to be a good hold among the Dalit youth of Western UP
 iske baavjood mayawati unhen tavajjo nahin di he
 While Chandrashekhar has been continuously saying that Mayawati is the leader of the Dalit community
 chandrashekhar ne mayawati ke buaa kah kar sambodhit kiya tha
 Mayawati never reacted to any of Chandrasekhar's statements
 shaayad yahi vajah ho sakati he ki chandrashekhar ab mayawati par nishaanaa saadhane rahe hai

 Before the Punjab Assembly elections 2017, the issue of drugs was prevalent in the state
 yuvakon main drugs kii lat kii becoground par bani vivaadit film ‘udata punjab’ bhi us vakt bahut surkhiyon main rahi thi
 Now after the allegations of a senior IPS officer, the focus has returned to the issue of alleged nexus between police and drug giants in Punjab
 1986 batch ke punjab cader ke ipies or dijipi rank ke adhikari siddharth chattopadhyaay ne punjab ke dijipi suresh aroda, punjab police intelegence chif dinakar gupta or moga ke esaspi raaj jeet singh par drugs sarganaon ko sangrakshan dene ke gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 It has also said that these senior officers are filling their pockets through the illegal trade of drugs
 aarope he ki chatopadhyaay ke khilaaf muhim ke peeche khud dijipi aroda hai
 Chattopadhyay is a four batch junior officer from Arora
 darasal, chatopadhyaay punjab or hoicourt kii ore se gathit us vishesh jaanch team (esaiti) kii aguai kar rahe hai jo drugs kii samasya se jude tamaam pahaluon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday heard Chattopadhyay's side in the case related to the suicide of former head of Khalsa Dewan Indrapreet Singh Chadha
 punjab police kii ek esaiti is maamle main chatopadhyaay kii kathith bhoomika ko lekar jaanch kar rahi he

 India Today tried to contact Punjab DGP Suresh Arora several times but did not succeed

 The government says that the matter is under court consideration
 bataa den ki pichley saal vidhansabha chunaav se pehle congress ne drugs kii samasya ko bada mudda banaaya tha
 Anupam Gupta, who represents Chattopadhyay, told India Today, "chadha is motivated by suicide case malice and DGP Suresh Arora and Dinkar Gupta are supervising the investigation against my client

 IGP Crime LK Yadav is following DGP Arora
 ’chatopadhyaayaki dikkatein tab shuru hui thi jab unhen is saal ke shuru main rajya main drugs racket kii jaanch ke esaiti kaa pramukh niyukt kiya gaya tha

 This is not the expectation
 lekin aakhir main ye uski jindagi kaa faisla he ki wo aage kaise badhanaa chaahati he
 Yes, we will be sad to leave Zaira, because he is a great artist
 "bataa den ki dangal main gita phogot ke bachapan kaa kirdaar nibhaa chuki jaayra wasim ne ravivaar subah apane soshal media acount se bollywood chhodane kaa elaan kiya tha
 He gave the reason for this decision to religion

 team india ke captain kool emes dhoni ne bangladesh ke khilaaf vanade siries ganvaane ke baad kaha ki agar board unhen captaini se hataanaa chahta he to unhen aisa karne main koi dikkat nahin he
 Dhoni became emotional on the question of captaincy at the post-match press conference
 unhone captaini par kiye gaye sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue kaha, 'main cricket kaa lutf uthaa rahaa hum
 If this (removing me from the captaincy) is correct, if it makes a difference to Team India and if they want to take the captaincy from me then i am happy with it

 He has batted well on fast wickets
 rahane ko thodaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 On the change in batting order, Dhoni said, "my idea was to go up the batting order and bat freely
" main batting order main upar aakar ballebaaji karnaa chahta tha
 It does not matter who Team India is playing against

 'dhoni ne kaha ki captain ke taur par main is haar kii puri jimmedaari letaa hum
 At the time of the match presentation, Dhoni said, 'we needed to score more runs

 kendriya grih rajya mantri kiran rigiju ne rashtriya rajdhani main somvaar ko kaha ki bharat or japan ke bich ghanishtha sambandh donon deshon ke lambey itihaas kii gaharaai se jude hai
 Both countries share common values such as commitment to democracy, supremacy of law, human rights and global peace
 yahaan objarwar research foundation (oref) dwaara 'bharat-prashanth kshetra : bharat-japan hiton kaa melmilaap' vishay par aadhaarit seminar ko sambodhit karte hue rigiju ne kaha, "bharat or japan donon ko apane rajanyik sambandh sthapit kiye 64 saal biit chuke hai or is avadhi ke dauraan donon desh aapasi mail milaap se ranneetik evam aarthik hiton par aadhaarit ek bahut majboot saajhedaari sthapit karne main samarth rahe hai

 Regarding the economic relationship, Kiran Rijiju said that Japan is helping in many huge infrastructure projects like delhi-mumbai Freight Corridor, delhi-mumbai Industrial Corridor, chennai-bangalore Industrial Corridor and mumbai-ahmedabad High Speed railway
 tippaniyan He said that the two countries have signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement to promote trade and investment

 ) narendra modi ke taur par bijepi ne desh ko pehla obisi pradhanmantri diya
 The political controversy over Amit Shah's claim is not being called off
 mukhya vipakshi party congress ne ise motaa jhooth qaraar diya he
 Party spokesman Raj Babbar lashed out at Amit Shah, saying that earlier he was the Subedar, now the party president
 unki raajnneetik jaankaree par to main koi tippanee nahin karuunga lekin ye motaa jhooth he
 Congress Rajya Sabha MP Pramod Tiwari called it the levelless statement of the BJP president
 bijepi par hamalaa karte hue unhone kaha he ki bharat ke pradhanmantri ko 125 karod logon kaa pradhanmantri nahin balki pehle ek dharm kaa pradhanmantri bana diya
 If that did not work then he became the Prime Minister of a caste
 phir ek varg kaa pradhanmantri bana diya he
 This is a sign of bjp's fury and declining popularity
 bijepi aisa bihar chunaav ko dhyaan main rakh kar rahi he
 Whereas the Prime Minister of the country belongs to the whole country and not to any caste
 darasal amit shah ke daawey par vipakshi partiyaan isliye bhadki hai kyonki desh main pachaas fisadi se zyaada aabaadi obisi kii he
 In such a situation, it is a direct issue related to political loss
 bihar main agle kuch maheene main chunaav hone hai jisamen obisi vot bank par sabaki nazar he
 The axis of Bihar's politics revolves around caste equations
 bijepi kii koshish obisi vot bank ko pukhta karne kii he
 If the BJP is able to do this then it will harm Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar
 isliye sabase pehle or sabase tikhi pratikriya jediu or argedy kii taraf se aayi
 Lalu said that the first OBC PM was Deve Gowda who had his role in making it
 nitish ne ye kah kar apni bhadaas nikaali ki piem ko sirf obisi kaa bataane se kuch nahin hoga
 Will have to see what they do for OBC
 nitish ne mauqe kaa phayda uthaate hue maang kii ki jati aadhaarit janaganana kii report ko saarvajanik kiya jaae
 Why is the central government sitting on it
 tippaniyan JDU general secretary KC Tyagi called the BJP a opportunistic political party
 kaha ki modi kabhi vikaas purush ho jate hai, kabhi hindu hriday samraat to kabhi obisi
 The party changes their color from moment to moment
 narendra modi loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle bhi kai manchon se khud ko obisi bataa chuke hai
 It is obvious that he also benefited and the party won most of the seats in states like UP and Bihar
 vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bijepi apni is kaamayaabi ko doharaana chaahati he
 So, Modi is describing Modi as the first OBC PM
 jati aadhaarit raajnneeti to har party karti he
 Nitish Kumar himself tried to cement the Mahadalit vote bank by making Jitan Ram Manjhi the chief minister
 haalanki daanv ulta pad gaya or maanjhi nitish kii sabase badi raajnneetik bhul sabit hue
 But now that Amit Shah is trying to get the BJP to take a break through the obcs, many opposition parties are thinking that the post of PM should be kept away from caste politics
 congress ke rajyasabha saansad pramod tiwari ne ise bijepi adhyaksh kaa starhin bayaan kaha he
 Attacking the BJP, he said that he made the Prime Minister of India not the Prime Minister of 125 crore people, but the Prime Minister of one religion first
 usase bhi kaam nahin chalaa to ek jati kaa pradhanmantri bana diya
 Then he has made a class prime minister
 ye bijepi kii baukhalaahat or kam hoti lokapriyata kii nishaani he
 The BJP is doing this with the Bihar election in mind
 jabaki desh kaa pradhanmantri puure desh kaa hota he na kii kisi jati kaa
 In fact, opposition parties have become angry over Amit Shah's claim because more than fifty percent of the population in the country is OBC
 aise main ye sidhaa sidhaa raajnneeti nafaa nuksaan se judaa mudda he
 Elections are going to be held in Bihar in the next few months, in which everyone is watching the OBC vote bank
 bihar kii raajnneeti kii dhuree hi jati samikarnon ke ird-gird gumti he
 The BJP is trying to strengthen the OBC vote bank
 bijepi aisa kar paati he to isse lalu yadav or nitish kumaar ko nuksaan hoga
 Therefore, first and foremost response came from JDU and RJD
 lalu ne kaha ki pehle obisi piem devegoda the jinako banane main unki bhoomika thi
 Nitish expressed his anger by saying that just telling the PM of OBC will do nothing
 dekhnaa hoga ki ve obisi ke liye karte kya hai
 Taking advantage of the opportunity, Nitish demanded that the caste-based census report be made public
 use kendra sarkaar dabaa kar kyon baithi he
 The comments jediu ke mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ne bijepi ko mauqaaprast raajnneetik party bataaya
 Said that Modi sometimes becomes a development man, sometimes a Hindu heart emperor and sometimes an OBC
 party pal pal unka rang badal detii he
 Even before the Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi has described himself as OBC from many forums
 zaahir he uskaa phayda bhi unako mila or upi or bihar jaise rajyon kii zyaadaatar siten party ne jiti
 The BJP also wants to repeat this feat in the assembly elections
 lihaaza modi ko pehla obisi piem bataa rahi he
 Every party does caste-based politics
 khud nitish kumaar ne jithan ram maanjhi ko mukhyamantri bana kar mahadalit vot bank ko pukhta karne kii koshish kii thi
 However the stakes backfired and Manjhi proved to be Nitish's biggest political mistake
 lekin ab jabaki amit shah obisi ke sahare bijepi kii naiya paar karaane kii koshish main jute dikh rahe hai, kai vipakshi partiyon ko khyaal aa rahaa he ki piem pad ko jatigat raajnneeti se dur rakhana chahie
 In fact, opposition parties have become angry over Amit Shah's claim because more than fifty percent of the population in the country is OBC
 aise main ye sidhaa sidhaa raajnneeti nafaa nuksaan se judaa mudda he
 Elections are going to be held in Bihar in the next few months, in which everyone is watching the OBC vote bank
 bihar kii raajnneeti kii dhuree hi jati samikarnon ke ird-gird gumti he

 The axis of Bihar's politics revolves around caste equations
 bijepi kii koshish obisi vot bank ko pukhta karne kii he
 If the BJP is able to do this then it will harm Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar
 isliye sabase pehle or sabase tikhi pratikriya jediu or argedy kii taraf se aayi
 Lalu said that the first OBC PM was Deve Gowda who had his role in making it
 nitish ne ye kah kar apni bhadaas nikaali ki piem ko sirf obisi kaa bataane se kuch nahin hoga
 Will have to see what they do for OBC
 nitish ne mauqe kaa phayda uthaate hue maang kii ki jati aadhaarit janaganana kii report ko saarvajanik kiya jaae
 Why is the central government sitting on it
 tippaniyan JDU general secretary KC Tyagi called the BJP a opportunistic political party
 kaha ki modi kabhi vikaas purush ho jate hai, kabhi hindu hriday samraat to kabhi obisi
 The party changes their color from moment to moment
 narendra modi loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle bhi kai manchon se khud ko obisi bataa chuke hai
 It is obvious that he also benefited and the party won most of the seats in states like UP and Bihar
 vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bijepi apni is kaamayaabi ko doharaana chaahati he
 So, Modi is describing Modi as the first OBC PM
 jati aadhaarit raajnneeti to har party karti he
 Nitish Kumar himself tried to cement the Mahadalit vote bank by making Jitan Ram Manjhi the chief minister
 haalanki daanv ulta pad gaya or maanjhi nitish kii sabase badi raajnneetik bhul sabit hue
 But now that Amit Shah is trying to get the BJP to take a break through the obcs, many opposition parties are thinking that the post of PM should be kept away from caste politics

 India are still 91 behind Australia, but Karun Nair lost a wicket when he was needed most by the team
 karun nair acchhee lay main nazar aa rahe the unhone pujaara ke saath milakar 44 ranon kii saajhedaari kii, lekin tabhi hezalwood kii ek gend par nair ek kharaab shot khel baithe, jisaki vajah se unhen apana wicket gavaana padaa
 After the captain and Kocharhane were out on a bad shot, when the Indian team needed a partnership, Karun Nair lost his wicket by playing a bad shot, which led to captain Virat Kohli and assistant coach Sanjay Bangar in the dressing room and leaving his chair there

 Nair was dismissed in exactly the same manner in the second innings of the Bangalore Test
 us samay bhi team ko ek badi saajhedaari kii zarurat thi agar nair isi tareeke se apana wicket gavante rahenge to team management ko majaboor hokar unhen baahar bithaana padegaa

 chrishchiyan mishael se poochtacha karne ke liye idi kii taraf se assistant diarector rohtas pandey or eio karan bansal ko tihaad jane kii anumati di gai he
 The ED wants to go to Tihar with some important questions and documents and interrogate Christian Michel again

 6 inch ke seene main badal kar rakh denge or ek inch bhi jameen nahin chodenge
 Rahul Gandhi also targeted the Vasundhara Raje government over its relationship with Lalit Modi and alleged that the former IPL boss was running the Rajasthan government remotely from London

 He has issued an ordinance thrice on the issue of farmers

 And who 5 it
 6 inch kaa karegaa, congress party yah karegi, is desh kii janata, kisaan or majdoor yah karenge
 You see
 ’ Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi compared the Raje government to the British government before independence when the government was in 'remote' London

 rahul gandhi ne lalit modi ke saath sambandhon ko lekar vasundhara raaje sarkaar ko bhi nishane par liya or aarope lagaaya ki rajasthan sarkaar ko purv ipel bos landan se remote se chalaa rahe hai
 Addressing party workers in Jaipur, Rahul said that the Modi government has issued ordinances on the Land Acquisition Bill thrice but despite this, they will not allow it to be passed in Parliament
 unhone kaha, ‘pehali baar ek aisi sarkaar aayi he jo vipaksh kii madad kar rahi he
 The government assists the Congress whenever they get an opportunity

 com / effpicki37 rafel lene france pahunche rajnath singhparis main karenge rafel kaa 'shastr pujan'imran khan, bajva ke saath jaaenge chinajinaping ke saamne uthaa sakate hai kashmir muddabharat kii ginati duniya kii mahashaktiyon main hoti he
 From the economy, trade and military front, India is proving to be the top country of Asia every day
 vaishvik str par bharat kaa kad teji se bad rahaa he
 The Indian Army is in the list of the top 5 armies in the world, while Pakistan seems to be in a bad shape on every front
 aaj jab france kii mashhoor port city, bordo main raksha mantri rajnath singh dashahara ke maukey par rafel par savaar hokar shastr pujan karenge to vahiin aarthik morche par aarthik sankat main gherepakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kashmir kaa ronaa rone china jaaenge
 The moment Pakistan's defense minister Rajnath Singh would perform arms puja on fighter aircraft Rafale in France, Pakistan's heart must have been shaken
 pakistan ko pataa he ki ek airstrike ne uski haalat kaise kharaab kar di thi
 But Rafael has the strength that he can find the enemy from any corner and mix it in the soil
 imran khan china akele nahin ja rahe hai, unke saath pakistan army ke chif qamar javed bajva bhi honge
 The surprising thing is that the way Pakistan Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa is holding important meetings one after the other in his country in recent times, it seems that Bajwa is not Prime Minister Imran Khan
 alag-thalag padaa pakistanjahan bharat aasmaan main khud ko sabase taqatvar banane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he, vahiin imran khan desh kii arthvyavastha ko patari par laane ke liye puri duniya ke saamne aarthik madad kii guhaar laga rahe hai
 But no country is coming forward to help them
 har morche par imran khan usee tarah fail najar aa rahe hai, jaise anuchhed 370 hataae jane ke baad unhone puri duniya ke saath-saath sanyukt raashtra main guhaar laga lee, lekin kahin se samarthan main sur nahin uthe
 How will people speak in support, when Kashmir is India's internal issue, on which only India has the right to decide
 pakistani media kaa daawa he ki imran khan dakshin asia main shanti bahaali ke liye china se charchaa karenge, aarthik, nivesh or ranneetik sambandhon par charchaa karen
 During this time, Imran Khan will also raise the issue of Kashmir
 kashmir par imran khan kuch bhi kar len, kashmir kii hifaazat ke liye bhartiya vayusena ko rafel milane ja rahaa he,jisaki takat se asia main bharat kaa rutaba or badhane vaala he
 Arms of 'rajnath' is the day of arms worship
 yah ravan par bhagwaan ram kii vijay kaa din he
 This time the biggest arms worship will be on this day in France
 raksha mantri rajnath singh sabase bade ladaaku vimaan rafel par dashahara ke din shastr puja karenge
 Rafael, who had put the moon in India's power, will now be a part of our Air Force
 aatankwaadiyon ke liye jananath pakistan kii sabase badi shamat aa rahi he
 Now the biggest air strike is coming against enemy terrorists
 bhartiya vayusena ko ghaatak-maarak mixilon se las rafel vimaan milane he
 The world sees the power of Rama on Dussehra riding on the back of traditions, in the new age the world will see the power worship of Rajnath, when he will do arms worship at Rafael in Paris, the capital of France
 bharat ko milegaa achook astrafrance ke ladaaku vimaan rafel ko hasil karne ke liye raksha mantri rajnath singh paris pahunch chuke hai
 This is the first time that the Defense Minister will do arms worship on a fighter aircraft
 shastr puja ke saath hi raksha mantri rafel main udaan bhi bharenge
 a might associated with this is that Rafale will give strength to the Air Force of India like never before
 vayusena diwas mila rafelfrance se bharat ko kul 36 ladaaku vimaan milane vaale hai
 This process starts from October 8
 isse acha sukhad sanyog kya hoga ki jis 8 oktober ko ladaaku vimaan kii chaabi bharat ko mil rahi he, wo vayusena diwas he
 Also on this day is Vijayadashami
 bhagwaan ram ke sarvocch shakti pradarshan kaa din
 Rafael will also show his greatest power over the enemy
 husal jab pados main pakistan jaise diwalia hote ja rahe desh ne china se advanced peedhee ke vimaan jeef-17 or america se epa-16 kharid liye, to bharat ke liye bhi ye jaruri ho gaya ki wo paanchavin peedi ke sukhoi ladaaku vimaan se apni vayusena kii takat main chaar chand laga de
 What is the specialty of Rafael? Rafael can destroy enemy targets on the ground with air to air, as well as it is capable of nuclear attack
 yah behad kam oonchai par udaan bhar saktaa he to bahut oonchai tak jaakar bhi missile daag saktaa he
 This aircraft has an oxygen generation system, so that there is no need to fill liquid oxygen in it
 dushman chaahe kahin bhi chhupana chaahe, ye ladaaku vimaan electranik scanning radar se thridi masping kar vaastavik samay main dushman kii pojishan khoj letaa he
 MBDA, the European company that produces state-of-the-art missiles for these aircraft, says that the most advanced two missiles in the fighter aircraft that India will get will help destroy the enemy
 isamen ek missile mitior dushman ke hamale ko hawa main hi naakaam karne vaali next jenereshan missile he
 While the scalp missile is going to be long range
 saath hi ye sargical strike jaise hamale ke yogya he or isko dushman ke ilaake main jane kii bhi jarurat nahin padegi
 Rafale It is equipped with advanced radar that can detect enemy aircraft missiles in any weather
 raksha mantri rajnath singh vijaydashami ko shastr puja isi rafel vimaan par karenge
 However, three months ago, Air Marshal Air Marshal RKS Bhadoria flew this aircraft to Paris
 safal rahi he rafel kii kahaneis fiter plane ke saare gunon ko pehle hi aajamaaya ja chukaa he
 It was used in the operations of Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Mali and it marked the success
 is ladaaku vimaan kii khaasiyat main ye bhi shaamil he ki ye 36 hajaar feet se lekar 50 hajaar feet tak udaan bharne main sakasham he
 The Rafale aircraft reaches 50 thousand feet in just 1 minute
 isaki raftaar 1,920 kilometre prati ghante tak hoti he
 Aircraft capable of flying from a very short runway of just 1,312 feet, the aircraft is taller, taller and more impressive than the American F-16
 21veen sadi kaa sainik bahubali vahi desh hoga, jisaki vayusena main zyada dam hoga
 Rafale will greatly increase India's power in South Asia
 agle saal may tak aaenge vimanvijaydashami ko rafel par hi raksha mantri rajnath singh kii shastr puja se hi ye fiter jet mil jayega, lekin france se hindustan aane main abhi agle saal may tak kaa intjaar karnaa padegaa
 Vijayadashami will bear the mark of the Indian Air Force on 4 Rafale fighter aircraft but it is reported that it will be in India by may-june next year
 tab tak das bhartiya payalat france main hi rahakar rafel par training lenge
 Apart from these, there will also be a team of engineers and technicians i
e
 a total of 50-60 people
 bharat ne france se kul 36 rafel ladaku vimaan kharide hai or wo saare fiter jet 2022 tak hindustan aa jaaenge
 First four planes will come and even after that 32 planes will come in four installments only
 inamen se 18 rafel ambala airbase par tainaat honge jabaki baaki 18 vimaan pashchim bengal ke hashimara base par
 The objective is clear that Pakistan will be directly monitored from the west and China from the east
 or tab pakistan ke thake haare pradhanmantri imran khan ko samaj main aayega ki parmaanu bam kii dhamkee dena jitna aasaan he, uski barbaadi kitni mushkil or bhayanak hoti he
 India knows Pakistan's jackal whale
 ek airstrike ne pakistan ke aatanki hausale post kar die,agar kahin rafel kii sidhi maar padi to pakistan ko uthne main sadiyaan lag jaaengi
 Why the need arose? Hindustan showed its power with the purchase of Rafale
 lekin airforce apni takat badhaane ke liye iske aage ke bhi kai vikalpon par kaam kar rahi he
 Pakistan is very proud of the F16 aircraft purchased from the US
 uske paas je-17, eff-16 or miraj bhi hai lekin inamen se koi bhi rafel kii tarah behad advanced takanic vaale nahin hai
 But India knows that there are many floors beyond the floor
 abhi bharat ke sabhi 32 squadran par 18-18 fiter plane hai
 The Air Force anticipates that if the number of aircraft is not increased, the number of squadrons will be reduced to 25 by 2022 and will be dangerous for India's security
 jabaki agle das saal main kam se kam 42 squadran kii jarurat hogi
 With the purchase of this Rafale, India has made a significant step in this direction
 porbandar boat maamle par raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne coast guard kii karrwai ko sahi samay par sahi karrwai bataaya he
 On Monday morning, the Defense Minister said that the way the people on the boat committed suicide, it was evident that they were terrorists
 unhone kaha kinav 12 ghante se nigaraanee par thior jitani jaldi ho saki karrwai kii gai
 The boat route was not common, as sea smugglers generally use busy routes

 taskar bhi vyast maarg chunate hai taaki vah anya naav kii bheed main ghul mil saken
 On the question of having three boats at the time of the incident, Manohar Parrikar said, 'it is true that there were other boats also, but they were in the international maritime boundary so they were not acted upon
 ' manohar parrikar ne ashanka jataai kii is puri kavayad ke peeche pakistan kii manshaa peshawar kii ghatana se sabhi kaa dhyaan hataane kii he

 ' Amid preparations to celebrate the 141st birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in the country on Saturday 2 October, Sumitra Gandhi Kulkarni, granddaughter of the Father of the Nation feels that many people are forgetting Bapu
 unke mutabik is vismriti se abhipraay gandhi ke asal aadarshon ko bhulaakar unhen yaad karne ke naam par aksar hone vaali khalis rasm adaayagi se he
 When 80-year-old Sumitra was asked where she could find her grandfather's ideology at present, she answered something like, 'you must agree with me, many people in the country are probably forgetting Mahatma Gandhi
 bhul jane ke baad ek najuk prakriya shuru hoti he, jo andar hi andar sugabugahat paidaa karti rahati he
 In a recent phone call from Bangalore, he said, 'I read in a newspaper a few days ago that when the child of the eighth or ninth was asked who Mahatma Gandhi was, he replied to Sonia Gandhi's father
 ’ gandhi ke naam par har kism kii shoshebaaji ke khilaaf sumitra ke mutabik, gandhi jayanti ke samarohon ko mahaj rasm adaayagi banaaya ja rahaa he
 She says, "after leaving these ceremonies, people forget Gandhi's ideals and get into daily business
 agar aap aisa kar rahe hai to apni hi chetana or antaratma ko bhulaava de rahe hai
 Recalling the early years of his life with Bapu, Sumitra said in an emotional tone, "the moment we consider Gandhi as a mere idol, the moment we forget him by making him of stone
" jab ham unhen sirf maanav maanenge, to unhen pathar kii murti main simatakar nahin rahanaa padegaa
 However, the former Rajya Sabha MP insists that the fundamental Gandhian way of fighting against injustice remains relevant even today
 unhone kaha, ‘aise main jab duniya bhar main hinsa rokane ke duusare tareeke naakaam ho rahe hai, mujhe lagata he ki antarrashtriya shanti or ahimsa kaa aahvaan karne vaala gandhi kaa satyagrah darshan punerjeevit ho rahaa he
 On the prevailing atmosphere across the country on the Ayodhya issue, he said that some people want the public to continue to struggle with chaos
 ‘jo log avyavashtha se jujhate rahete hai, ve na to vikaas kar sakate hai, na hi galat hatkandon ko rokane kii himmat rakh pate hai
 She says, "if this issue (ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute) is left to the people of Ayodhya, they will settle it and forget it in fifteen days
 ’ek sawaal ke jawaab main sumitra maanati hai ki gandhi ko ‘brands’ bana diya gaya he or is par vah khulkar naaraazgi bhi jataati hai
 He sarcastically said, 'as often as we take Gandhi's name, we can also promote ourselves well
 philhal mujhe itnaa pataa he ki gandhi ke naam par sharaab nahin bik rahi he
 On the growing trend of the word "gandhigiri", Sumitra said that if today's youth wants to use the word Gandhigiri against Dadagiri, then what can be wrong in this
 basharte iskaa makasad or nateeja galat na ho
 Expressing deep regret over the degradation of Khadi, he said that the charkha, the symbol of an ideology, can still be practiced in the homes of the country despite all the changes of the times

 prashanth kishor ne patna main mukhyamantri se mulaakaat ke baad kaha tha ki nitish kumaar enarasi ke virodh main hai
 Prashant Kishore then categorically stated that linking CAA with NRC would add to the problem
 kishor ne us samay kaha tha ki nitish ne vaada kiya he ki bihar main enarasi lagu nahin hoga
 After this, CM Nitish Kumar announced a red flag to the NRC in Bihar
 naagarikta sanshodhan adhinium (siee) kaa samarthan kar rahe janata dal (united) ke pramukh nitish kumaar ne shuukravaar ko patna main patrakaron se kaha ki bihar main enarasi lagu nahin hoga
 1100 celebrities came out in support of CAA, said- The atmosphere of fear being spread deliberately is notable that earlier on the protests across the country on the Citizenship Amendment Act, Nitish Kumar said on Thursday that minorities will not be allowed to be neglected during his stay 
 gauratlab he ki nitish ne gaya main ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha, 'ham guarantee dete hai ki ham logon ke rahete hue alpansakhk samaaj kii kisi prakaar kii upeksha nahin hogi
 There will be no loss

 Sangakkara expressed surprise that despite so many Indian cricketers, none of the BCCI qualified for the post and he appointed the foreigner as coach after the departure of Gary Kirsten
 unhone kaha, duniya ke is hisse main main sthaneey coach kaa matlab he ki us par beete samay ke anubhavon kaa kaaphi dabaav hoga jisase uski koching or khilaadiyon ke prati rukh main bhi badlaav aa saktaa he
 So sometimes foreign coach is convenient from all these perspectives
 sangakaara ne kaha, lekin is kshetra main itane achche cricketron ke baavjood, yah sharmnaak he ki rashtriya team kii koching ke liye kisi bhartiya ko bhi yogya ummidavaar nahin paaya gaya

 In the final match played at Lord's ground on Sunday, England defeated New Zealand and won the ICC World Cup-2019 title
 lekin is match ke baad isisi ke niyamon ko lekar sawaal uthne lage hai
 Rohit Sharma, who scored the highest 648 runs in this cricketing league, said that some of the ICC rules need to be seriously considered
 unhone twit kiya, 'cricket ke kuch niyamon ko gambhir rup se dekhe jane kii jarurat he
 'some rules in cricket definitely needs a serious look in
 — Rohit Sharma (@imro45)july 15, 2019rohit sharma ke alaava purv bhartiya khilaadi or vartmaan main bijepi saansad gautam gambhir ne bhi isisi ke niyamon par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Gambhir said that the rule to make the team a winner based on the number of boundaries is absurd
 unhone kaha, 'match ke vinar kaa faisla boundry kii sankhya ke aadhaar par hua
 This ICC rule is absurd

 england or newjiland ke bich khele gaye world cap final mukaable main match or phir super over ke taai hone ke baad boundry kii sankhya ke aadhaar par england kii team ko vijeta ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In this match, England had put a total of 26 boundaries (fours and sixes), including 50 overs and super overs
 vahiin, newjiland ke khate main sirf 17 boundry hi the
 In such a situation, England were declared winners after the tie
 isisi ke is niyam ke khilaaf soshal media par bhi logon ne jamkar aawaaj uthaai he
 The ball hit the batsman on the throw, yet in the final match of the Not Outworld Cup, Martin Guptill reached the boundary by the hand of Ben Stokes, running for a throw run
 haalanki, ampire ne ise out dene ke bajaay 4 ran die
 Questions have also been raised on this rule
 isisi ke niyam ke mutabik agar ran daudte samay ballebaaj thro ke saamne aata he or gend uske balle yaa sharir se ruk jaati he to zyaadaatar maamalon main use out mana jaataa he
 However, the umpire has the right to take decisions at such a time

 Actually, Roy was clearly LBW on this ball of Bolt but the umpire did not give any indication after appealing that he survived
 haalanki, ampire ke is faisle ke khilaaf newjiland ke captain ken williamson ne rivyuu liya or phir riple main dekha gaya ki jesan roy saaf-saaf out the
 But the review did not work due to the umpire call and Jason Roy survived without opening the account
 isisi ke is niyam par bhi sawaal uthne lage hai
 People say that after reviewing, it was found out that Jason Roy was out, he should have been given out
 nahin to ken williamson ke rivyuu lene kaa kya phayda hua
 Now, from the former players to the current players, these rules have started to be raised

 uske mutabik bade shaharon main sthaneey bilderon or niveshkon dwaara banaae gaye hajaaron makaanon ke daam main pichley ek saal main 20 se 30 pratishat tak kii giravat ai he
 The reason is that there is no buyer in the market and the builders want to get rid of them because their crores of rupees are stuck in them
 patr ne ek bade brokar kaa hawala dete hue bataaya he ki uske paas 50 makaan bikne ko aae hue hai lekin unke liye kharidaar nahin mil rahe hai
 He told that there are no buyers
 jo poochtacha kar bhi kar rahe hai wo bhi kharidne main icchhuk nahin he kyonki unki najar main inaki keemten zyada hai
 HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh said that the market is loose
 secondary bazaar main kharidaar nahin he or us segment main keemten neeche aa rahi hai
 Anshuman Magazine, MD, property consultant CBRE South Asia, said that the number of unsold houses in the property market is increasing
 inaki sankhya badhane se nivesh inhen nikaalane ko aatur hai
 So this is a good chance to remove them
 lekin kharidaar abhi aashwast nahin hai
 Although the possibility of Narendra Modi becoming the PM in the stock markets is increasing, but this does not apply in the property market

 People are not willing to buy houses

 com / ia842b6mdw The people and people of Haryana are not only being disturbed by the arguments and actions of the Khapas, but the whole country is no longer taking them seriously or calling them 'mad'
 haryana main badhate rape ke maamle par unka nayaa bayaan to hairaan kar dene vaala hai
 Khapas have said that the cases of rape are increasing in the state as they are eating chowmin
 apane kathan par unka tark he ki chaumin khaane se yuvakon kaa hormone bad rahaa he jisase vah rape ke liye uttejit ho jate hai
 Earlier, to stop the rape, there was a suggestion from their side that the marriage age of girls should be reduced from 18 to 15 years
 milane julne se bad gaye hai rape ke maamlekhap to khap duusari taraf hamaare netaaon ke bayaan bhi unki samaj ko dikhaate hai
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said on Monday that nowadays the mixing of boys and girls has increased, due to which more cases of rape are coming
 modi sarkaar ke chaar saal se zyada ke kaarykaal main pehali baar aae avishvaas prastaav ko manjuur kar liya gaya he
 The no-confidence motion will be discussed and voted in the Lok Sabha today
 modi kii tarah vaajapeyi sarkaar ko bhi avishvaas prastaav kaa saamana padaa tha
 The Congress came out with a proposal against the Vajpayee government in August 2003 in collaboration with opposition parties
 modi sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav aise samay aayaa he, jab chunaav main ek saal se bhi kam samay bachaa hua he
 However, the NDA has sufficient number, so there is no threat to the government
 isi tarah se hi vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ke paas bahumat ke aakade the
 Despite this, the Congress, along with the opposition, had brought a no-confidence motion against the Atal government in 2003, because they had assigned George Fernandes to the Ministry of Defense
 vaajapeyi ke netritv main pehali aisi gaiyr-congressi sarkaar bani thi jisane apane kaarykaal ko puraa kiya tha
 After this, the second government is now headed by Narendra Modi, who seems to be completing his five-year term
 vaajapeyi sarkaar ke khilaaf aae avishvaas prastaav ko endie ne aasaani se paar kar liya tha
 While the BJP had less than a majority of seats at the time, the BJP currently has 273 mps
 2003 main vaajapeyi sarkaarake khilaaf laae avishvaas prastaav ke samay endie ne bahut hi aaraam se vipaksh ko voton kii ginati main haraa diya tha
 The NDA got 312 votes while the opposition was reduced to 186 votes
 avishvaas prastaav par voting se tamilnadu kii eidiemke or faruk abdulla kii party neshnal conference ne khud ko alag rakhaa tha
 Whereas the BSP voted in favor of the Vajpayee government
 vaajapeyi ke khilaaf laae gaye avishvaas prastaav par charchaa ke dauraan tatkaaleen vipaksh kii netaa or congress kii us samay adhyaksh raheen sonia gandhi ne sadan main hindi main bhaashan diya tha or unhone vaajapeyi sarkaar ko kai morchon par asthir bataaya tha
 In the same way, when Sonia Gandhi was asked if you had enough numbers after the motion of no confidence was brought against the Modi government, her reply was, who says we do not have numbers? Vajpayee was brought against the government The Congress may have lost the House in the no-confidence motion
 lekin iskaa prabhaav usee saal hone vaale chaar rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav or agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav main hone the
 While Congress won Delhi, it also had an impact on elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan
 bijepi yahaan beshak jeet gai lekin uski siten pehle se kam ho gayi
 After this, the Congress-led UPA won the 2004 Lok Sabha elections
 modi sarkaar ke khilaafalaaye gaye avishvaas prastaav kaa samay bhi vaisaa hi he
 This time, however, the no-confidence motion moved by the Congress has not been approved, instead Andhra Pradesh has been brought by the TDP for special status
 baavjood iske avishvaas prastaav laane kii timming vahi he
 Elections are to be held in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan after a few months
 teenon rajyon main bijepi kii sarkarein hai
 The Congress is expecting a return to power in these states
 dilachasp baat ye he ki atal sarkaar kii tarah hi modi sarkaar ke khilaaf aae avishvaas prastaav par voting ke dauraan eidiemke ne sadan se baahar rahane kaa faisla ek baar phir kiya he
 The 2019 Lok Sabha elections are due after one year
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki piem modi bhi atal kii tarah loksabhaa chunaav ko samay se pehle kara sakate hai, jabaki congress unhen maat dene ke liye vipakshi dalon ke saath gathbandhan karke chunavi maidan main utarana chaahati he
 In 2004, the then Congress President Sonia Gandhi had mixed several parties to defeat Atal
 ab rahul bhi usee formule par aage bad rahe hai
 It has to be seen whether the history of 2003 is repeated again or Modi will write a new speech in 2019
 ek mahila kaa dil jeetne ke liye kitne yphone paryaapt honge? jawaab shaayad koi nahin jaanata
 But thanks to the person from China, due to which we came to know that at least 99 iphones are insufficient in this case
 guangaju ke rahane vaale ek programmer ne apni garlfriend ko behad dilachasp andaaj main prapoj kiya
 He bought 99 iphones and decorated them like a ring in the shape of a heart on the ground
 is anguthi ke bichombich khadey hokar usne apni garlfriend ko prapoj kiya
 But according to the news published in 'the Nanfang', the girl also turned down this interesting proposal
 khabar ke mutabik, us shaks ne yphone kharidne main 50 lakh rupee se zyada kii rakam kharch kii thi
 This money was equal to that person's two-year salary
 baad main is prapojal kii tasviren china kii soshal media website 'vibo' par viral ho gayi
 However, some people on social media commented that the proposal was 'silly'
 yah bhi vidambnaa he ki shaks ne jab apni garlfriend ko prapoj kiya, uske agle din hi yani 11 november ko china main 'singles de' manaaya jaataa he
 Like India, the iphone is considered one of the most valuable devices in China and is in great demand in the early days of launch
 to bhale hi programmer sahab ko apana pyaar nahin mil paaya, lekin jaankaar maanate hai ki agar vah thodi chaalaaki barte to 99 yphone kaa fresh stock waapas bechakar vah apana kaaphi paisa waapas paa saktaa he

 For the last one year, bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi, who has been seen in thousands from one place, has been in the spot
 upie sarkaar kii lakwagrast nitiyon, asafalataaon or satta virdohi lahar ne bijepi ke liye is baar ke loksabhaa chunaavon main sanjivani kaa kaam kiya
 And what was the right thing to do on this, the BJP completed it by declaring Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the PM candidate
 aaie jaanate hai apni aakraamak or lubhaavni vikaas kii baton se janata ko mohane vaale thri di modi kii jeet ke wo 10 kaaran, jinaki badaulat aaj puraa maahaul modimay he
 Determination of target: BJP, which has been away from power for the last ten years, had clearly set its goals for this year's Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi netaa sirf or sirf arjuna kii tarah machhlee kii aankh par nishaanaa lagaae rahe
 It was his clear goal to put as many Lok Sabha seats in his bag so that if there was a time to form a government, there would be no chance of spreading his hand in front of anyone
 netaa kaa chayancongress party kii tarah bhagava party main chunaav nateezon ke baad netaa kaa chayan nahin hota
 Already here, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi was declared the candidate for the post of PM, which showed the effect of his elusive personality in the party and the public
 netaa kaa chayan hone se desh digbhramit nahin rahaa jabaki iske ulat congress main netaa kaa chayan na hone se party or uske samarthakon donon main asamanjas bana rahaa
 This emptiness of leadership became a serious problem for the Congress
 asafalataaon par nishanabhartiya janata party ne is baar ke chunaavon main upie kii lakwagrast nitiyon or uski asafalataaon ko jamkar bhunaaya
 In every post and poster, the failures of the central government were targeted

 Rising inflation, declining growth rate and declining foreign direct investment, such as arrows BJP fired from its quiver against UPA
 jan andolan kaa laabhcongress sarkaar ke khilaaf badhate jan asantosh kaa sidhaa-sidhaa laabh desh kii duusari sabase badi party bijepi ko miltaa dikhaa
 Whether it was the social activist Anna Hazare's agitation against corruption or the night in Delhi, where the savage poor had made Nirbhaya cry tears of blood, the agitation that helped the BJP strengthened the wave against the ruling Congress

 Bringing young spirit together This time in the Lok Sabha elections, the main focus of BJP cadres was towards the young voters

 In this episode, many things of the party's veteran leaders like Lal Krishna Advani, Sushma Swaraj were rejected outright
 bhagava party main do chamakate sitaron ne aisi sthiti paidaa kar di ki jaswant singh jaise netaa, jo bijepi sarkaar main videsh mantri rah chuke hai, unke party chhodane kii naubat aa gai
 Meaning, everything should be new and shining

 This time for the young and literate India, the social media brigade of the Bharatiya Janata Party has created a boom in Facebook and Twitter
 bijepi kii raily, prachaar or party ke mishan ko jabardast tareeke se soshal media ke jariye logon tak pahunchaaya gaya
 By giving live coverage and live photos of the rally, the bjp's social media brigade attracted voters to a large extent
 takanic kaa jabardast istemalbijepi ne in chunaavon main takanic kaa jabardast tareeke se istemaal karke matadaataaon se sampark saadhaa
 3D coverage of their rallies, most meetings through video conferencing etc
 brought more and more of their public interest and the central government's unnecessary policies to the voters
 chunaav shuru hone ke baad desh ke tamaam bade channelon par partiyon ke netaaon ko mili kawarej par ai ek report se pataa chalaa he ki modi ko akele ek tihaai kawarej mili yani 33 fisadi samay mila

 kshetreey chatrapon kaa sathbijepi ne apni puraani ranneeti badalte hue is baar sidhe sidhe kshetreey chatrapon ke daravaajon par dastak di
 Most of the party leaders continued to interact with regional parties across India
 ek vyakti ke kaaran jahaan kuch dal party se chhitake hai to vahiin kai ne daaman bhi thama he
 The party also made its policy a bit flexible this time
 bijepi ne buudhvaar ko yah spasht kiya ki chunaav purv gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin rahaa koi bhi dal yadi use apana samarthan dena chahta he to uske liye party ke daravaaje khule hai
 Public campaign of public meetings: Narendra Modi, the candidate for the post of PM of BJP, has broken the record of Lok Sabha election campaign by his smokeless campaign
