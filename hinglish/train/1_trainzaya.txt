 Shocked by the accusations during the recent hockey crisis, AK Mattoo resigned from the post of President of Hockey India and other administrative posts of various sports organizations

 Certainly it has also played an important role in my decision
 ’ unhone kaha ki kalmari ne unke istife ke bare main unase kuch nahin kaha he
 Mattoo said, 'kalmadi has not spoken to me yet whether he has accepted my resignation or not
 agar mujhe rashtramandal khelon tak bhi pad par barkaraar rakhane ke liye kaha jaataa he to main aisa nahin karnaa chaahunga
 Mattoo said that he had no doubt about the success of the upcoming Hockey World Cup to be held in february-march and the Commonwealth Games in October
 mattu kaa hockey india adhyaksh kaa kaarykaal saat farvari ko samaapt hona tha or isi din hockey india ke chunaav honge, jisase nai samiti kaa gathan hoga
 Like every year, the railway budget is set to come this year
 charchaa hogi ki kya tikaton ke dar saste honge, bullate train jald chalaane ke liye kya kadam uthaaye ja rahe hai vagairah vagairah
 But it is difficult to discuss what the government did for the people of rural areas
 shahar main to apni maangon ko lekar log awaz buland kar lete hai lekin gramin ilaakon main ye nahin ho paata isiilie railway bajet main kuch gadiyon ke stopage badhaane ke alaava unke liye kuch nahin hota
 If you want to see this, then you do not have to go to states like Bihar or Odisha, but in the state of Gujarat called developed
 yahaan ek train chalati he, rajya ke do mahatvapurn shaharon nadiyaad or modasa ke bich
 This train travels about 100 kilometers 4 times a day i
e
 twice from Modasa to Nadiad and twice from Nadiad to Modasa
 rozaana kareeb 1500 se lekar 2000 yatri tak din bhar main is train main safar karte hai
 But if you travel in this train, then you will not be without realizing how the train traffic would have been before the development
 is raste par kareeb 16 phatak aate hai
 Generally it happens that when you reach the gate and the train is coming, the gate closes and after the train leaves the gate opens and normal traffic starts
 lekin yahaan ulta hota he
 There is no railway staff at any of the 16 gates here
 lihaaza koi durghatana na ho jaae isliye phatak band karne ke liye do log rozaana is train main hi safar karte hai
 Traffic runs normally before each gate but the train stops
 ek vyakti utarataa he or phatak band karke train ko jane kaa ishaara karata he or driver ke peeche vaale dabbe main chadh jaataa he
 The train stops again after crossing the gate
 guard ke peeche vaale dabbe se ek vyakti utarataa he phatak kholta he or phir chadh jaataa he
 Then the train moves forward
 isi ke chalate ye puri train sirf dhimi gati kii train banakar rah gai he
 One more thing is for the passengers on this route
 aam taur par aap apana scooter, bike yaa car har thode samay par sarvice main bhejte ho or waapas aane tak duusari sawari par chalate ho
 The same happens with these travelers
 har saptaah shuukravaar ko ye train sirf subah aati he or shaam ko waapas jaati he
 Meanwhile, this train goes to the nearby city of Anand for service
 isliye yahaan ke yatri is samay ke dauraan bas main hi safar kar lete hai
 If so, most of the stations running on this route are in a shabby condition
 na baithne kii suvidha, na chat kaa thikaana or na hi pani yaa shauchalay kii vyavastha
 It is not a matter of just one root
 yahaan paas ke aanand zile main ek or train chalati he kathana toun se vadodara jankshan tak
 a station comes on this route, Borsad
 borasad vaise to bahut bada bhi nahin or na hi ekadam na ke baraabar he, yah madhyam shrenee kaa kasbaa he
 It is also important to mention that this is a VIP station
 upie sarkaar main bharat solanki yahaan se saansad the joki rail rajya mantri bhi the
 Borsad is also his own city
 lekin is stesan kii haalat bhi waisi hi he
 There is neither toilets here, so people who come and defecate in open bushes
 hamane poocha ki svachh bharat mishan par karodon rupye kharch kiye ja rahe hai or aise gyanavardhak vigyaapan bhi bane hai taaki khule main shouch ko roka ja sake
 The only way to get a reply from a traveler Chandubhai is that even if there is no toilet, do not go because there are no toilets
 pehle bane honge to kabhi safai nahin hui or sirf taale hi lage hai
 There is no drinking water either
 dopaher ke kareeb ek baje the or suraj maathe par chadh aayaa tha
 In a family, children were crying for water
 poocha, to mahila yatri gulshan ne kaha yahaan to pani he nahin or aaj jaldbaazi main vah ghar se laana bhul gai thim
 He further explained that there is not only water and toilets but there is also no electricity
 iskaa ehsaas aapako hota he subah savere kii train main
 a train arrives here at seven o'clock in the morning and then if you come with the children, the whole station looks ghostly in the dark
 bachche jab tak train nahin aati dar ke maare dubake rahete hai
 Not only children, elders are also afraid of such an environment
 tippaniyan There were spider webs at the ticket counters as well and someone had turned the bathroom inside, so there was a strong smell from there
 hamen laga ki shaayad suvidhaayen nahin hai to sarkaar shame ke maare muft yatra kaa phayda detii hogi
 But thinking that a person came on a bike and stopped near a pole
 khambhe par likhaa tha yahaan tikat miltaa he
 He sat down, decorating the ticket shop like a paan shop
 logon ko tikat baantne laga
 We asked, brother, do you give tickets? The station does not have facilities
 majhahar malik m ke is shaks ne bataaya ki vah railway kaa karmchaaree nahin he
 He has only contracted to sell tickets
 isliye jab train aane vaali ho, usase 15 - 20 minute pehle vah aa jaataa he or tikat bechakar chalaa jaataa he
 There is not a single railway employee at this entire station
 poochne par railway prashasan ne bataaya ki ye root nuksaan main chalate hai
 There is not enough money to invest here
 is par kuch yatriyon kii baat yaad ai jo kah rahe the ki ye sarkaar he ki vyapaaree jo nafe nuksaan kii baaten kehete hai
 Is it not the government's job to provide facilities to all the people, without any loss of money, by providing tax to the people? agar aisa hi rahaa to ab tak nahin hua or aage bhi gramin ilaakon ko railway kii suvidhaon se vanchit hi rahanaa padegaa
 But they hope that at some time a government will come which will think about the people of the villages - after all, more than half of India still lives in the villages

 hamen laga ki shaayad suvidhaayen nahin hai to sarkaar shame ke maare muft yatra kaa phayda detii hogi

 But they hope that at some time a government will come which will think about the people of the villages - after all, more than half of India still lives in the villages
 aam taur par aisa hota he ki aap phatak par pahunchen or train aanevaali he to phatak band ho jaataa he or train jane ke baad phatak khul jaataa he or saamaanya yatayaat shuru ho jaataa he
 But the opposite happens here
 yahaan ke 16 main se kisi phatak par koi railway karmchaaree nahin he
 So in case of no accident, two people travel daily in this train to close the gate
 har phatak se pehle yatayaat saamaanya chalata he lekin train ruk jaati he
 a person descends and closes the gate and signals the train to leave and climbs into the driver's rear box
 train phatak paar kar phir ruk jaati he
 a man descends from the box behind the guard, opens the gate and then climbs
 tab train aage babbti he
 Due to this, this entire train has become just a slow train
 ek or baat is root par chalane vaale yatriyon ko akharati he
 Normally you send your scooter, bike or car to service every little time and walk on another ride till you come back
 vaisaa in yatriyon ke saath bhi hota he
 Every week on Friday, this train only comes in the morning and goes back in the evening
 is bich ye train paas ke shahar aanand main sarvice ke liye jaati he
 Hence, the passengers here travel by bus during this time
 itnaa kam ho to is root par chalane vaale steshnon main zyaadaatar jarjar haalat main hai
 No seating facilities, roof terrace nor water or toilet facilities
 ye sirf ek root kii baat nahin he
 Here another train runs from nearby Anand district to Kathana Town to Vadodara Junction
 is root par ek stesan aata he borasad
 Although Borsad is not very big nor equal, it is a middle class town
 iskaa zikr isliye bhi zaruri he ki ye ek viipi stesan he
 Bharat Solanki was an MP from the UPA government, who was also the Minister of State for Railways
 borasad unka apana shahar bhi he
 But the condition of this station is also the same
 yahaan par na to shauchalay hi he isliye aane vaale log khuli jhaadiyon main bhi shouch kar lete hai
 We asked that crores of rupees are being spent on the Swachh Bharat Mission and such informative advertisements have also been made so that open defecation can be stopped
 ek yatri chandubhai se jawaab mila iskaa ek hi rasta he ki shouch lage to bhi na jaayen kyonki shauchalay hai hi nahin
 If it was built earlier, it was never cleaned and only the locks were installed
 pine kaa pani bhi nahin he
 It was around one o'clock in the afternoon and the sun had reached the forehead
 ek parivaar main bachche pani ke liye bilakh rahe the
 When asked, the female passenger Gulshan said that there is no water here and today she forgot to bring it from home in a hurry
 unhone aage bataaya ki sirf pani or shauchalay hin nahin balki yahaan bijli bhi nahin he
 You realize this in the morning train
 subah saat baje yahaan ek train aati he or tab agar aap bacchon ke saath aaen to andhere main puraa stesan bhutiya prathit hota he
 The children remain afraid until the train arrives
 sirf bachche hi nahin, bado ko bhi dar lage aisa maahaul hota he
 The comments tikat counter par bhi makadi ke jaale the or andar kisi ne bathroom kar diya tha isliye vahaan se tej badboo aa rahi thi
 We felt that perhaps the facilities would not have given the benefit of free travel in shame
 lekin yah soch hi rahe the ki ek vyakti motor saaikal par aayaa or ek khambhe ke paas rukaa
 It was written on the pillar, we get tickets here vah paan kii dukaan kii tarah tikat kii dukaan sajaakar baith gaya
 Started distributing tickets to people
 hamane poocha bhai aap tikat dete ho? stesan par suvidhaayen hi nahin hai
 This man of Mazhar Malik told that he is not an employee of the railway
 usne sirf tikat bechney kaa theka liya hua he
 So when the train is about to arrive, it arrives 15 - 20 minutes before that and goes after selling tickets
 is puure stesan par railway kaa ek bhi karmchaaree nahin he
 When asked, the railway administration said that these routes run at a loss
 yahaan par itani thik kamai nahin hoti ki yahaan par paisa lagaaya jaae
 On this, some travelers remembered that they were saying that it is the government that the traders who say things about loss
 kya sarkaar kaa kaam nahin he ki logon se jo tex vasuul karte hai, us paise se sabhi deshavaasiyon ko bina phayda nuksaan soche, suvidhaayen pradaan karen
 If this remains so, it has not happened till now and rural areas will have to be deprived of railway facilities even further
 lekin unhen umid he ki kabhi koi sarkaar to aegi jo gaanvon ke logon ke bare main sochegi - aakhir aadhe se zyada bharat ab bhi gaanvon main hi rahata he
 One more thing is for the passengers on this route
 aam taur par aap apana scooter, bike yaa car har thode samay par sarvice main bhejte ho or waapas aane tak duusari sawari par chalate ho

 isliye jab train aane vaali ho, usase 15 - 20 minute pehle vah aa jaataa he or tikat bechakar chalaa jaataa he
 There is not a single railway employee at this entire station
 poochne par railway prashasan ne bataaya ki ye root nuksaan main chalate hai
 There is not enough money to invest here
 is par kuch yatriyon kii baat yaad ai jo kah rahe the ki ye sarkaar he ki vyapaaree jo nafe nuksaan kii baaten kehete hai
 Is it not the government's job to provide facilities to all the people, without any loss of money, by providing tax to the people? agar aisa hi rahaa to ab tak nahin hua or aage bhi gramin ilaakon ko railway kii suvidhaon se vanchit hi rahanaa padegaa
 But they hope that at some time a government will come which will think about the people of the villages - after all, more than half of India still lives in the villages
 tikat counter par bhi makadi ke jaale the or andar kisi ne bathroom kar diya tha isliye vahaan se tej badboo aa rahi thi
 We felt that perhaps the facilities would not have given the benefit of free travel in shame
 lekin yah soch hi rahe the ki ek vyakti motor saaikal par aayaa or ek khambhe ke paas rukaa
 It was written on the pillar, we get tickets here vah paan kii dukaan kii tarah tikat kii dukaan sajaakar baith gaya
 Started distributing tickets to people
 hamane poocha bhai aap tikat dete ho? stesan par suvidhaayen hi nahin hai
 This man of Mazhar Malik told that he is not an employee of the railway
 usne sirf tikat bechney kaa theka liya hua he
 So when the train is about to arrive, it arrives 15 - 20 minutes before that and goes after selling tickets
 is puure stesan par railway kaa ek bhi karmchaaree nahin he
 When asked, the railway administration said that these routes run at a loss
 yahaan par itani thik kamai nahin hoti ki yahaan par paisa lagaaya jaae
 On this, some travelers remembered that they were saying that it is the government that the traders who say things about loss
 kya sarkaar kaa kaam nahin he ki logon se jo tex vasuul karte hai, us paise se sabhi deshavaasiyon ko bina phayda nuksaan soche, suvidhaayen pradaan karen
 If this remains so, it has not happened till now and rural areas will have to be deprived of railway facilities even further
 lekin unhen umid he ki kabhi koi sarkaar to aegi jo gaanvon ke logon ke bare main sochegi - aakhir aadhe se zyada bharat ab bhi gaanvon main hi rahata he

 China's capital Beijing is improving, but India's capital Delhi is deteriorating
 dilli ke sabase pradooshit ilaake anand vihaar kaa air quality index 703 he
 At the same time, Beijing's most polluted area, Liu Lianzin, has an air quality index of 74
 yani dilli kaa pradooshan takreeban 9 guna he
 The least polluted area of delhi has an air quality index of 290 of Mandir Marg
 to beijing ke huiru ilaake kaa 30, yani dilli se takreeban 9 guna kam
 When the breath is suffocating and the stifling air is making us sick, the question is, can we adopt such an alarm system on the lines of Beijing? It may take time, but do we really have any distant thinking which can be implemented from today onwards

 dilli ke ek makaan main rakhi almaari se mahila kii laash milane se hadakamp much gaya
 The woman lived on the first floor of the same house
 dekhne se laash do teen din puraani lag rahi he
 Police suspect that the murderer may have concealed the corpse after the murder
 yah sansanikhej vaardaat dilli ke gokulpuri ilaake kii he
 In a house where the woman's body was found in the cupboard
 police ne maukey par jaakar shav ko kabje main le liya
 The woman was identified as Nita
 jo usee ghar ke first floor par rahati thi
 If sources are to be believed, it is seen from the first glance that the corpse of the woman is two to three days old
 yani agar kisi ne nita kii hatya kii hogi to vah do-teen din pehle kii gai hogi
 The woman had been living in this house for a few months
 uske mata-pita bhi is ilaake main rahete hai
 The police have come to know that she was living in a live-in relationship
 mahila kaa shav milane ke baad police uske boyfriend se poochtacha kar rahi he
 The police sent the body for post-mortem after the Panchnama action

 The police suspect his live-in partner for murder
 philhal, police maamle jaanch main juty he
 Kajari Teej is on Thursday, August 10
 kajri teej ke din suhaaginon ko pati kii lambii umr kaa vardaan miltaa he or kunvaari kanyaon ko achche var kaa arshivaad miltaa he
 It is believed that on this day, Mother Parvati received Lord Shiva with her harsh penance
 is din sanyukt rup se bhagwaan shiv or parvati kii upasna kerani chahie
 By this, virgin girls get a good bridesmaid and those who are suhagins always get the blessing of being fortunate
 baidhnath dham mandir: 'panchashul' ke darshan maatr se hoti he manokamana purishighra vivaah se iskaa kya sambandh he?vastav main teej kaa sambandh sheeghra vivaah se hi he
 Unmarried girls should worship Gauri specially by keeping fast on this day
 aisa karne se kundali main kitne bhi baadhak yoga kyon na hon, is din kii puja se nasht kiye ja sakate hai
 But it will be of full benefit only if unmarried do this remedy themselves
 ho rahaa he surya kaa raashi parivartanis din kaa puja vidhaan kya he ?- is din, puure din upwas rakhana chahie tathaa shringaar karnaa chahie
 - Mehndi and bangles must be used in makeup
 - saayam kaal shiv mandir jaakar bhagwaan shiv or maa parvati kii upasna kerani chahie
 - a large lamp of ghee should be lit there
 
 
 
 So this is why the gemstone of the Sun is special - if possible, chant the mantras of Maa Parvati and Lord Shiva
 - puja khatm hone ke baad kisi saubhagyawati stri ko suhaag kii vasteen daan kerani chahie or unka aashirwad lenaa chahie
 - Using black and white clothes is considered taboo on this day, green and red colors are the most auspicious
 dilli ke khyala thane ke antargat aane vaale raghubir nagar ilaake main guuruuvaar ko raat kareeb 8 baje ek shaks kii chaaku se galaa retkar hatya kar di gai
 23-year-old Ankit, who looked like a model, used to do photography
 is maamle main police ne chaar aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya he or paanchave kii talash jari he
 It is said that Ankit was returning home from the office, then at the crossroads near the house, Ankit's friend's family surrounded him and beat him first and then stabbed him on his neck, killing him
 hamale ke khabar sunakar ankit kii maa kamalesh bhi maukey par pahunch gayi
 It is alleged that his son was strangled to death in front of him
 ladki ke parivaar waalon ne unke saath bhi marpet kii
 Actually Ankit lived with his family in the colony of Raghubir Nagar in the same colony, a girl lived a few years back
 un donon kii dosti thi

 katl ke peeche bhi yahi vajah bataai ja rahi he
 The comments police ne ladki kii maa, pita or bhai samet mamaa ko giraftaar kar liya he jabaki ek naaballig bhai kii abhi talash jari he
 There was an attempt to create tension over this murder case
 subah kuch log jo apane aap ko bajrang dal kaa bataa rahe the, thane pahunche
 The police force was also deployed in view of the situation, however they later withdrew as the victim's family was satisfied with the police action
 aropiyon ko giraftaar bhi kar liya gaya he
 Sources say that the deceased Ankit was associated with the Bajrang Dal some time ago and for this reason people of the Bajrang Dal had allegedly reached the police station
 philhal ilaake main shanti he
 Ankit's mother has denied the boy-girl friendship
 unka kahana he ki ve bhai-bahan kii tarah rahete the
 At present, the accused have been arrested and the reason behind the murder is being ascertained

 tippaniyan Police have arrested the maternal uncle, including the girl's mother, father and brother, while a search is on for a minor brother
 hatya ke is maamle ko lekar tanaav paidaa karne kii koshish hui
 In the morning some people, who were telling themselves of Bajrang Dal, reached the police station

 The mlas staying in the party waiting for the party high command's instructions to the Shiv Sena legislators will follow the directions of the high command
 The legislators of the army and 8 independent legislators supporting the party are staying at the Retreat Hotel in Malad, Mumbai
 in vidhayakon ko matoshri se party haikaman ke agle nirdeshon kaa intazaar he
 Some Shiv Sena mlas told India Today that whoever gets instructions from the high command will follow them
 shivasena vidhayak jo baat ekasur main kah rahe hai wo he mukhyamantri shivasena se hoga
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had meetings with his wife Rashmi Thackeray and son Aditya Thackeray at the hotel on Sunday
 party ke saare vidhayak aashwast hai ki maharashtra main ensipi or congress ke samarthan se shivasena kii hi sarkaar banegi
 Army MLA from Thane Pratap Sarnayak told India Today, “we have been here for the last four days
 hamane kisaanon ke muddon par vichaar kiya
 Their crops have been damaged due to rain
 jaise hi sarkaar banegi shivasena unke byaaj maaf karegi or unki jameen ko mukt karegi
 The decision to form the government is that of party chief Uddhav Thackeray
 jaisaa ki uddhav thakare ne elaan kiya he ki bala sahib thakare kii ichha ke anusaar mukhyamantrishivsenaka hoga or ham us disha kii ore bad rah hai
 "all of us party mlas and independents, a total of 64, have handed over a letter of support to the Chief Whip of the party to sign to the Governor after signing," Sarnayak said
 sabhi vidhayakon ke raaj bhawan jane kii jarurat nahin he
 From time to time, we are getting instructions from Matoshree
 ham ishwar se prarthana kar rahe hai ki jaldi se jaldi sarkaar bane
 When asked about the ongoing dialogue with NCP and Congress, Yavatmal Army MLA Sanjay Rathod said, "as far as the demands of Congress and NCP are concerned, Uddhav Thackeray is our party chief and he must be talking to them
 hamen itnaa pataa he ki mukhyamantri shivasena kaa hoga
 If we become the Chief Minister of the army, we will try to help the farmers because they have suffered a lot due to the weather
 ”rathod ne kaha, ‘hamaara uddeshy he ki kisaanon ke saare jameen sambandhi maamle saaf hon or wo guzaaraa sahi tarah se chale
 According to Nayak, Uddhav Thackeray repeatedly told about the 50-50 formula and said that the Chief Minister would belong to the army
 ham dukhi hai ki hamaare sahyogi apane vaade or shabdon par nahin tikaa rahaa
 Nor did he honor his commitment

 In this regard, there was a lot of excitement on Monday

 President of the Press Council of India, Markandey Katju, resented the 'excessive' coverage of film stars, cricket, astrology on TV channels to increase viewership rather than focusing on real issues like economy, poverty, unemployment and farmer suicides
 Pointed out
 tippaniyan At the conference 'media and Its Responsibilities' organized by All India Small and Medium Newspaper Federation (all India Small and Medium Newspapers Federation), Katju expressed regret that the topics which news channels emphasize are related to cricket, astrology or film
 And there are such as which actress is pregnant and who gave birth to child etc
 unhone kaha ki jab cricket khilaadi rahul dravid ne khel se sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa kii or jab abhinayta rajesh khanna kaa nidhan hua tab kuch channelon ne in khabaron ko kis had tak ‘‘hyper media’’ kawarej diya
 Katju said, 'what difference does it make whether Rajesh Khanna is alive or not
 ’ unhone niraashaa jaahir kii ki garibi, berogari, kisaanon kii aatmahatya jaise muddon ko samaacharon main apekshit mahatv nahin miltaa

 Recently, film actor Sanjay Dutt, who joined the Samajwadi Party, has been appointed as the General Secretary of the party
 unke mahasachiv banane kii ghoshnaa samaajawaadee party kii press conference ke dauraan kii gai
 On this occasion, Sanjay Dutt said that he will work wholeheartedly for the party
 unhone kaha ki ve sachai ke liye kaam karte rahenge
 Sanjay Dutt said that his father was unhappy over the inclusion of Sanjay Nirupam in the Congress
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne sanjay dutt ke chunaav ladane par roak laga rakhi he
 In electoral discussion these days, one word which is coming on the tongue jovially, is cap
 baat paramparaagat muslim topi kii ho rahi he
 During his Sadbhavna Mission in September 2011, Narendra Modi refused to wear it
 ab ek tivi intervyuu main unhone phir kaha he ki tushtikaran ke pratikon ke prachlan main unhen vishwaas nahin he, jabaki bijepi ke adhyaksh rajnath singh kii aisi hi topi pahane ek tasviir in dinon charchaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 Before breaking the relationship with BJP, Nitish Kumar attacked Modi by saying that the tradition of the country is such that it also has to be worn with a hat and a vaccine
 desh kii raajnneeti kaa jaisaa swaroop ho gaya he, usamen topi, tilak, pagadi yaa hat sab pahanane yaa na pahanane ke apane sankethik mahatv banaae ja rahe hai
 This trend, which started from Iftar politics, is gradually becoming a symbol of appeasement
 nabbe ke dashak main achaanak dilli ke lutian zone main ai iftaar partiyon kii baadh ne desh kii raajnneeti main muslim vot bank or siyasat main unki bhoomika ko phir centre stage par laa diya
 Which leader's house is iftar party and who is joining it, it became a big topic of discussion in the political corridors
 topi lagaakar photo khinchvaane or phir ise chhapavane kii parampara bhi aisi iftaar partiyon se hi zyaada prachlan main ai he
 In this, no leader has neither stayed back nor wants to stay
 bijepi main shuru se hi udaar chhavi ke netaa maane jate rahe atal bihari vaajapeyi bhi isamen kabhi peeche nahin rahe
 As prime minister, Vajpayee always went to such iftar parties and posed for photographs
 yah alag baat he ki tatkaaleen mantri shahanwaaz hossain kii ek aisi hi iftaar party main unhone ayodhya main janmabhumi par ram mandir or babari masjid kahin or banane kii baat kahkar siyaasi hangaamaa khadaa kar diya tha
 In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, BJP, riding on Feel Good and India Shining, had put photos of Vajpayee's meeting with the then President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, promoting this symbolic and what Modi calls the politics of appeasement
 , Which many RSS leaders had made their mouths with
 lekin aresas rashtriya muslim manch ke zarie musalamaanon ko apane kareeb laane kii koshish bhi karti rahi he
 This has been going on since before the 2004 elections
 iskaa jimmaa sangh ke varisht netaa indresh ko diya gaya he, jin par ajmer dhamaakon main shaamil hone ke aarope lagaae gaye or poochtacha bhi kii gai
 In a recent function of this National Muslim Forum in Delhi, BJP President Rajnath Singh had spoken about apologizing to Muslims
 ise 2002 ke gujarat dangon se jodakar dekha gaya or ye bhi mana gaya ki rajnath khud ko udaaravaadi netaa ke rup main pesh karne ke liye ye baat kar rahe hai
 Later, the party clarified Rajnath's statement by clarifying it
 vahi rajnath ab topi laga kar photo khinchvaa rahe hai
 Meeting with religious leaders of Shia sect in Lucknow
 iske baad shiya netaaon ke bayanon main rajnath ko vaajapeyi ke saath khadaa kiya jaataa he or kaha jaataa he ki musalamaanon ko modi se dar lagata he
 It is not a coincidence that Rajnath Singh left Ghaziabad seat and chose Lucknow seat
 vah lakhanu seat jo atal bihari vaajapeyi kii pahchaan ban gai he or bijepi main unki viraasat kaa pratik
 Before filling the form, Rajnath takes Vajpayee's blessings and fills his form by wearing his body parts
 jabaki gajiabad seat par bijepi kii haalat utani kharaab nahin thi jitani ki rajnath singh ke samarthak bataate hai
 Apparently Rajnath's contesting from Vajpayee's seat, Shia religion gurus like Rajnath as Vajpayee and earlier Rajnath's apology to Muslims for his mistakes, point to how Rajnath's own steadfastness Bihari is trying to portray a liberal image like Vajpayee
 dilachasp baat yah he ki jab congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne jama masjid ke shahi imam se mulaakaat kii thi, tab rajnath singh ne un par sampradayik raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 LK Advani will always be remembered for one thing in Indian politics
 ram mandir ke liye unki rath yatra se bijepi ko zabardast samarthan mila or party kii takat main abhootpurv izaafaa hua, lekin unhone pradhanmantri pad ke liye apane bajaae atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa naam aage badhaayaa, kyonki vaajapeyi ne ram mandir andolan se dur rahakar apni udaaravaadi chhavi ko banaae rakhaa tha or unheen ke naam par bijepi nae sahyogiyon ko jod satta main aa sakati thi
 Can this happen again? chaahe janamat surveykshanon main endie ko spasht bahumat milane kii baat kahi ja rahi ho, lekin bijepi main kai netaaon ko ab bhi ummid he ki agar aisa na ho paae, to shaayad modi ke bajaae kisi duusare netaa ke naam par nae sahyogiyon ko saath lekar sarkaar banaai ja sakati he
 But they probably forget that Modi has now worn the development on his image of the poster boy of Hindutva
 modi chaahe vaajapeyi jaisi chhavi abhi na bana paae hon, lekin unke rahete kisi duusare netaa ko mauka mil sake, isaki sambhaavna na ke baraabar he
 So, whether it is a cap or a vaccine, whose secret will be on May 16, it remains to be seen

 Until the rules are in place, the pilot cannot take more than 125 hours of work

 Because it can be very dangerous and fatal for the pilot as well as all the passengers

 Lack of complaints cannot be the answer

 chhattisgarh ke rajasav mantri jaisingh agarwal ne kaarybhaar grahan karne ke saath hi apane jile ke purv colector ko jamkar latada
 That is also because the then Collector ordered an inquiry into a disputed matter related to his land
 tatkaaleen colector pi
 Dayanand had received a complaint that local MLA Jaisingh Aggarwal, using his influence, bought the land of a tribal without legal action
 is jameen kii registry radd kar di thi
 Now when the Congress government came to power and the MLA himself became the Revenue Minister, he opened a front against the then Collector of his district
 rajasav mantri jaisingh agarwal ne kaha ki ab us colector ke bhrashtacharon kii jaanch hogi
 The Tehsildar, Patwari, RI did not want to enter my house, but all this happened under the patronage of the then Collector

 All the scams during Dayanand's tenure will be investigated and the punishment of those scams IAS p

 This was the case from 12 August 2015 to 30 May 2017 p

 During this time, the Additional Sessions Court Korba directed to register an FIR against MLA Jaisingh Aggarwal and four others for purchasing tribal land in village Chuiya of Korba
 is maamle main purv main ek shikaayat par korba ke tatkaaleen colector pi
 Dayanand had issued an order for cancellation of the land of MLA Jaisingh Agarwal on finding the land of the tribal farmer
 niyamon ke mutabik, kisi adivasee kii jameen jab koi gaiyr adivasee kharidta he to iske liye colector se anumati leni hoti he
 The Collector, in his investigation report in this case, had found that the MLA had purchased and sold land in violation of the Revenue Act
 lihaaja unhone is jameen kii registry radd kar diya tha
 Against this, MLA Jaisingh Agrawal obtained a stay from the Board of Revenue
 uttar pradesh main apane jameen, makaan yaa flats kii registry karaane ke liye jo log 500 or 1000 rupaye ke puraane note lekar registry offis gaye the unhen buudhvaar ko baari pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Most of the people did not work, on the contrary, they had to wander from here to there
 logon kii pareshaani kaa kaaran tha uttar pradesh sarkaar dwaara mangalvaar ko jari kiya gaya ek aadesh jisamen yah kaha gaya tha kii registry main500 or 1000rupaye ke puraane note sweekaar kiye jaaenge
 All the newspapers of the state also featured this news prominently
 lekin jab log buudhvaar ko registry karyaalay pahunche tab unhen pataa chalaa ki puraane note se wo stamp paper nahin kharid sakate balki sirf registry fees ke taur par adhik se adhik ₹2 xxrep 4 0 chukaa sakate hai
 Actually there was confusion in the office of the registry department itself regarding the government's order
 lakhanu ke registry offis main maujuud tamaam vakil, mangalvaar kii shaam ko jari kiye gaye upi sarkaar ke us aadesh kii copy dikhaa rahe the jisamen yah kaha gaya tha ki puraane note ke badale stamp paper or registry shulk adaa kiya ja saktaa he
 But those who tried to buy stamp paper from the old note did not get the stamp
 baad main adhikariyon se poochtacha karne par pataa chalaa ki uttar pradesh sarkaar ne apane aadesh ko thodi der baad hi badal kar ek nayaa aadesh jari kar diya
 In the new order, it was said that only the registry fee can be paid from the old Rs 500-1000 note but stamp papers cannot be purchased
 is asamanjas kaa nateeja yah hua ki registry karaane aae tamaam log maayoos hokar laute or registry kaa kaamkaaj lagbhag thap hi rahaa

 purv kendriya mantri va congress saansad shashi tharur ko patni sunanda pushkar ke bare main sawaal poochna raas nahin aayaa or unhone media ko 'jhootha va gira hua' bataa diya
 Tharoor was questioned on Wednesday following a Delhi court order in which the court had given permission to the Delhi Police to conduct polygraphy tests of three of his associates
 unase poocha gaya tha ki aakhir unke sahyogi unki patni sunanda pushkar kii rahasyamayi paristhitiyon main hui maut ko lekar sach kyon nahin bayaan kar rahe hai? To this he said, "I will talk to the police and not to the lies

 iske sanket aaj bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne kaaryakartaaon ko diye hai
 Amit Shah is said to be angry with the Shiv Sena's decision to abstain from voting on the no-confidence motion
 amit shah ne avishvaas prastaav se ek din pehle hi shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare ko phone kiya tha
 After that there was a possibility that Shiv Sena would support the government
 avishvaas prastaavke dauraan shivasena ke bartaav se naaraaz amit shah ne aaj mumbai main maharashtra bijepi ke netaaon se kaha ki jis tarah beete kuch samay se shiv sena kaa vyavhaar rahaa he, khaaskar avishvaas prastaav main anupasthiti, uske baad hamen maharashtra main akelaa chunaav ladanaa pad saktaa he
 Therefore, we should be ready in all 48 Lok Sabha seats
 amit shah ne maharashtra bijepi netritv se kaha he ki sabhi 48 siton par loksabhaa prabhariyon kii niyukti jald se jald kii jaae
 Shiv Sena has already announced that it will contest the 2019 elections alone
 avishvaas prastaav se thik pehle shivasena ne modi sarkaar ko samarthan nahin karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said his party would boycott voting on the no-confidence motion
 saamana main likhaa gaya tha ki is samay desh main taanaashaahee chal rahi he
 Instead of supporting it, she would like to go with the public
 elahabaad ke baraav se maanav taskaron ke changul se chhudaakar yahaan laai gayi ladakiyon ne chhattisgarh ke balod main kai khulaase kiye hai
 More than 400 girls from various countries are in the clutches of human traffickers, including various regions of the country
 khulaasa hua he ki taskaron kaa mukhya adda baraav hi he
 Most people, including its leader Sheru, are living here
 baalod ke police adheekshak shaikh aarif hossain ne kaha ki baraav main ek samvedansheel red lite aria he, jahaan sargana sheru kii bahut pahunch he
 We have taken all 14 girls out of the state, but now they have more than 400 girls from other states, who have been brought into the trade of prostitution by Sheru bringing them to the Red Light area
 unhone bataaya ki chhudaayi gayi ladakiyon se sheru ke kaarobaar ke bare main kol detail khangale ja ja rahe hai
 He also has to be arrested
 is dauraan koshish rahegi ki anya rajyon kii ladakiyon ko bhi sahi salaamat le aaen
 The police has saved 14 girls from the state from being sold
 maanav taskari ke bade maamle kaa khulaasa rajya main hua he
 Two days ago, six girls, who were rescued from Barav in Allahabad, were introduced to their families at the SP office on Sunday night
 baraamad kii gai ladakiyon se sheru ke thikaane or uske kaarobaar ke bare main vistrut jaankaree jutai ja rahi he
 The police questioned the girls, including many big revelations, which the police are also shocked to hear
 bataaya gaya ki desh ke vibhinn rajyon ke saath padosi desh nepal kii ladkiyaan bhi baraav main hai
 These 6 girls were actually recovered from where they were acclaimed
 mukhya sargana ne maasoom bacchiyon ko jism ke kaarobaar main utaar diya tha
 Before these girls were sold, the police killed Red and the girls were rescued
 ladakiyon ne bataaya ki giroh dwaara arcestra main le janaa to ek bahaanaa tha
 Their main business is businessmen
 is dhandhe main ladakiyon ko ye ek-ek kar jhonkate hai
 First girls take them to dance between 1 to 5 pm to show off
 iske baad vahaan dance dekhne aane vaale ayyash ladke unka sauda kiya karte the
 The gang men used to lure girls who were less educated and dance enthusiasts with them
 baraav sheru kaa pramukh adda he
 He is a resident of the same place
 isliye vahaan ke sthaneey police waalon se uske achche sambandh hai
 He puts his week in the account of the policemen
 yahaan chah maheene pehle laai gayi ladkiyaan bhi maujuud hai
 Many of the previously brought girls are also pregnant after being pushed into the business of sex
 kuch ladakiyon ke chote chote bachche bhi hai, jo ab bacchon ke khatir us daldal se nikal nahin paa rahi hai
 Kneeling and living life
 kuch ladkiyaan aisi bhi hai, jinke galat kaaryo ke bare main jaanane ke baad unke parijan bhi unase rishta tod die hai
 There is no contact with them
 elahabaad uttari bharat kshetra main he
 The gang has hunted poor girls in and around the state of Uttar Pradesh
 zyaadaatar is adde main utraakhand, bihar, utranchal, bhopal, nepal, pune, agra, dilli sahit anya rajya se laai gai ladkiyaan rakhi gai hai
 These are auctioned one by one
 naaballig ladakiyon kii demand zyada he
 From now on, to say that Arvind Kejriwal has conquered Delhi, it will not only be hasty but also unjust
 to jeet-haar kaa faisla 10 taarikh par chhod dete hai
 But even without this decision, some signs can be seen very clearly
 pehla- pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa puure chunaav ke dauraan arvindakejariwal par jamkar hamalakarna
 Whereas to be reversed
 desh main raaj kar rahe pradhanmantri ko apni party kii uplabdhiyaan ginani chahie thim or kejariwal un par hamalaa karke unki kamajoriyaan ginate
 This strategic aggression of Modi not only brought Kejriwal to the center of the election, but also introduced him as the first leader who also scared Modi
 kejariwal puure chunaav main mafalar baandhe masumi se apana kaam karte rahe
 His innocence, even if it was strategic, was liked by the people
 matdaan se thik pehle aae surveykshanon ne kejariwal kii is chhavi ko dilli ke baahar pahunchane main der nahin lagaai
 Late in the survey, Nitish Kumar, Sharad Yadav, Mamta Banerjee and HD Deve Gowda announced their support to Kejriwal
 in ghoshnaaon kaa vot ke lihaaj se dilli main koi vyaavhaarik mahatv nahin he
 But these statements matter in the politics of the country
 nitish or sharad ko nau maheene baad bihar main vidhansabha chunaav ladna he or unki ladaai modi kii shakhsiyat se dabi bijepi se he
 On the other hand, Mamata Banerjee's entire party is so caught up in the chit fund scam that mps and mlas are coming in its favor
 bengal main marxvaadiyon kaa daur biit rahaa he or bijepi sidhe aar-paar kii ladaai lard rahi he
 These are the leaders who, while staying in the country, weave the fabric of the Third Front
 lekin ye sab milakar bhi modi kaa muqabla karne kii haisiyat main nahin hai
 Actually, they have been in the politics of their respective areas for so long that their national image is not made
 prachaar tantra main bhi wo modi ke saamne tik nahin pate
 Corruption allegations from above prevent them from becoming organized power
 aise main kejariwal ke paas vah cheharaa he jo desh ke swatchta abhiyaan main modi se kam paak-saaf nahin he
 The big crown of honesty is embellished on his head with the image of an agitator
 agar wo dilli fatah karte hai to pehle aise shaks honge jinhone modi ke ashwamedh yajna ke ghode ko lagaam khinchakar bitha diya hoga
 In this case, their brightness will increase in the middle class than ever before
 yah varg isliye mahatvapurn he ki propaganda kaa is varg se zyada sahaj vaahak doosraa koi varg nahin he
 That is, they have all the characteristics that should be in the person who becomes the axis of the third front
 congress jis tarah ke raajnneetik sadame se guzar rahi he, vaise main uske paas iske alaava or koi chaara nahin hoga ki vah kejariwal ke ird-gird banane vaale tisare morche ko samarthan na bhi de, to use chede nahin
 All these things are inference based, but not irrational
 aakhri 1984 main sarvashaktimaan pradhanmantri bane rajeev gandhi ke saamne bhi to isi tarah dhai saal ke bhitarvi pi singhnaam kii chattan aa gai thi
 In the time filled with information revolution, then two and a half years would be equal to nine months today
 aise main bahut sambhav he ki desh main ek baar phir sattavirohi andolan kii bhoomika banane lage
 Especially as the harsh statement made by US President Barack Obama against Modi on communalism is an indication of the initial news coming against Modi
 agar bijepi dilli haar gai to unki aparaajey chhavi bhi khandit ho jaaegi
 This defeat will please the marginalized crowd within his party more than the opposition
 vaise bhi yah desh ek ajeeb kism ke santulan kaa divaana he
 The elephants living in it are like ras, but the holiday bull never likes it
 yani paristhitiyaan kejariwal ke nai bhoomika ke liye taiyaar rahane ke sanket de rahi hai
 It is clear that if such a role is formed, then its activism will be seen openly at the end of 2017 because by then the atmosphere of the next general election will start to form
 haa, itnaa jarur yaad rakhana hoga ki bhale hi kejariwal veepi kii bhoomika main aa jaaen, lekin yah jaruri nahin he ki modi rajeev kii raah hi chalenge
 He may blunt the edge of the opposition by making a bigger point
 lekin philhal jandhan ke khate khulwakar dhan aane kii baat joh rahi janata, zyada der intjaar nahin karegi
 In such a situation, either money will come in the account or a VP will come before Modi
 aaj jab ham mahila shashaktikaran kii baat karte hai, to yah samaj lenaa jaruri he ki sirf naukari karne yaa swaavlambee hone se hi mahilaayein shashakt nahin ban saktin
 It is important that they also know about their rights
 par kya bharat kii shatpratishat mahilaayein apane sanvaidhanik or kanoonee adhikaron ke bare main jaanati hai
 No
 ek survey ke aankadon ke mutabik bharat main 65 fisadi mahilaon ko apane kanoonee or sanvaidhanik adhikaron ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin he
 At the same time, 33 percent women are half aware about their rights
 aisi mahilaayein puure desh main sirf 2 fisadi hai, jinhen apane adhikaron kii puri jaankaree he
 30 to 40 percent of India's 120 crore population is women
 par unamem sirf 2 pratishat mahilaon ko apane adhikaron kii jaankaree hona, mahila shashaktikaran ke bich kaa sabase bada roda he
 Here we are talking about some such rights and laws, which every woman should be aware of
 'chhedhkhani se suraksha moulik adhikaar, intjaam kare sarkaar'zero exiarais adhikaar ke tahat koi bhi aurat chhedchhad yaa rape kii shikaayat kisi bhi shahar ke kisi bhi police stesan se kar sakati he
 It is generally seen that police stations do not write firs for crimes of crime which are not in their area
 ek baar kisi bhi police stesan main exiaar darj hone ke baad, us police thane kaa koi senior police adhikari yaa esechao khud us exiaar ko us thana kshetra main jaakar darj karaayega, jahaan se ghatana sambandhit he
 Right to Privacy Under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code, a woman can record her statement alone in front of the magistrate in a rape case
 iske alaava vah kisi ladi kanstable yaa police officer ke saamne bhi statement record kar sakati he
 It depends on how she wants to give her statement
 sonam kapur ne chat sho main bolaa, 'haa mere saath kam umr main hui thi chhedchhad'free kanoonee madadpulice stesan jaakar koi bhi mahila ni:shulk kanoonee madad maang sakati he
 FIR by email or letter, if the woman does not want to go to the police station or is unable to go
 is cese main wo email ke jariye yaa chitthee bhej kar bhi apni shikaayat darj karvaa sakati he
 SHO of the police station will investigate the case and file an FIR as soon as the letter or email is received
 iske baad peedita apana statement ghar se hi likhaa sakati he
 Women never need to wait to file a complaint
 kyonki kanoon ke mutabik wo kabhi bhi apni shikaayat darj kara sakati hai
 That is, the police of the police station cannot say that a case cannot be registered due to non-receipt of complaint at the right time
 dillih chalati train main mahila ke saath kii lutpaat, chhedhchhachandhere main arest nahinsupreme court ke aadesh ke anusaar suraj ugane se pehle yaa suraj doobane ke baad kisi mahila kii giraftaar nahin ho sakati
 Whether or not a woman constable is with her, in any case a woman cannot be arrested overnight
 giraftaar ke liye magistrate kaa letters saath hona jaruri he ki aakhir kyon raat main hi us mahila kii giraftaar aavashyak he
 No interrogation in police station
 Under section 160, a woman cannot be called to police station for interrogation
 police usase ghar par hi poochtacha kar sakati he
 But it is important that the woman's family or her friend and female constable are there
 har offis main ho Sexual Harassment Complaints committeesuprima court ke disha-nirdeshon ke anusaar offis main mahilaon ke adhikaron kii raksha ke liye Sexual Harassment Complaints Committee honi chahie
 It is necessary to have 50 women among the members of this committee
 yadi offis main mahila ke saath yon utpeedan hua he to yon utpeedan adhinium ke tahat shikaayat darj kerani hogi
 The results of a recent survey by an international women's and child rights NGO based on data harassment and violence by the figures suggest something similar
 19 saal kii umr se pehle das main chaar ladkiyaan utpeedan or hinsa kaa shikaar ho jaati hai
 73 percent of women have suffered some form of harassment or violence in the last few months
 41 pratishat mahilaayein aisi hai jo yah baat maanati hai ki unhen haal hi main jabadasti unki marji ke khilaaf chhua gaya
 a woman was trying to suicide at a metro station in New Delhi
 ek naaballig bachche ne security ko alert kar jaan bachaa lee
 The woman left for the tracks after leaving the children away
 lekin security ne uski jaan bachaa lee
 This incident happened on Thursday
 CISF ke karmi ne bataaya- uttar pashchim dilli ke inderlok metro stesan par ek mahila apane do bacchon ke sang pahunchi thi

 Around 18 states will become ODF by March, our entire focus will be on these four or five states

 balki bahut mamukin he ki bade paimaane par desh main sampradayik dange bhi chhid jaaen
 Because Pakistan has always wanted that Muslims and Hindus should never be united in India

 Although no Congress leader misses an opportunity to target Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, but if Digvijay Singh talks about it, hardly any chance is better than him
 digvijay singh ne is baar modi kii tulana kar di he germany ke taanashaah 'hitler' se
 Digvijay Singh said that through Modi posters and hoardings, sometimes Vivekananda, sometimes Balgangadhar Tilak and sometimes Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel are glorifying themselves
 unhone kaha ki modi logon kaa dhyaan jamini hakeekat se hataane ke liye aisa karte hai
 He said that Hitler also gained power by glorifying himself in Germany and becoming a dictator, while Modi is also trying to follow his path
 digvijay singh ne kaha ki modi ne ab bijepi main apana kad itnaa bada kar liya he ki unke dal ke sabhi netaaon ke kad unke saamne boune ho gaye hai
 He said that this situation in BJP is not only with Modi but also the situation of Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Madhya Pradesh and Chief Minister Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh
 unhone kaha ki in donon rajyon main bhi mukhyamantriyon ne apni sthiti aisi hi bana rakhi he or yahaan bhi anya netaa nepathy main hai

 How serious the Delhi government is regarding nursery admission can be gauged from the fact that the website of the Directorate of Education itself was not updated on the first day of admission
 dilli main mishan nursery admician shuru, skulon ke niyamon ko lekar kanfujanagideline ke mutabik 2 janvari sedakhileki prakriya shuru honi thi or skulon ko nirdesh die gaye the ki 1 janvari tak sabhi skool apni website par point system kii jaankaree aplod kar denge
 But when the admission process started on 2 January, there was no information on the Directorate of Education website for the centralized online application for the EWS category
 yahaan tak ki daakhile ke liye saal 2017-18 kaa link bhi aplod nahin kiya gaya he
 Due to which the parents are seen upset
 nursery admician: ye tips aasaan kar denge har kamnursery daakhile main paardarshita barkaraar rahe isliye dilli sarkaar ne pichley saal se EWS ketegory ke liye centralined online aavedan kii prakriya shuru kii thi
 This year also the government has adopted the same procedure but it is full of problems for parents of EWS category to understand this process of online application
 indrapuri se apane bachche ke daakhile ke liye aaye nandlaal ko ye to pataa he ki daakhila online hoga lekin kaise or kahaan hoga unhen is baat kii jaankaree nahin thi
 He reached the school to collect this information
 nandlaal ne kaha ki ofline aavedan kii prakriya aasaan thi usamen galtiyaan hone kii gunjaaish kam hoti thi
 But fear persists in online applications
 EWS ketegory ke jo parents online prakriya se waakif bhi he wo bhi pareshaan bhatak rahe hai kyonki shiksha nideshaalay kii website par saal 2017-18 kaa link apadet nahin kiya gaya he
 The link on the website is from last year
 jabaki shiksha nideshaalay ne privet skulon ko ravivaar tak criteria or point system aplod karne ko kaha tha
 Parents of the general category are also disturbed Like the parents of the EWS category, those parents of the general category are also wandering from school to school, who have to enroll their children in schools built on the DDA land
 lekin guideline nahin jari hone kii vajah se aise abhibhavak niraash hokar waapas laut rahe hai
 Explain that the Directorate of Education has ordered about 298 schools built on government land once again by issuing circulars and not to start the admission process
 darasal didie se jameen lij par lete vakt skulon ko ilaake ke bacchon ko daakhile main praathamikta dene ke baat kahi gai thi
 According to the schools, they have been adhering to the Neighborhood Criteria in admissions before but if other criterias like Sibling, Alumnae are completely ignored then both the school and parents will have difficulties
 lekin sarkaar chaahati he kiprivet skool75% open seat par nebarhud ke bacchon ko anivaary rup se daakhil den
 Schools have challenged this decision of the government in court

 On this whole matter, Congress leader HK Patil said that withdrawing the support of two independent mlas will not affect our government

 They are independents

 pashchim bengal chunaav prachaar ke dauraan siem mamata banerjee ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par janakar hamalaa bolaa
 Banerjee said on Saturday that PM Modi should not speak like this
 vah aresas kii bhashaa bolte hai
 PM Modi targeted Banerjee on Thursday in Asansol
 nijee hamale par nahin karti yakintiemasi pramukh banerjeene piem modi par nijee hamale karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said that i have never made personal attacks on any leader
 main vaajapeyi ji, jyoti basu or buddhadev bhattacharya kaa bhi sammaan karti hum
 i have no alliance with anyone
 modi ne ghataya piem pad kaa maanmamta banerjee ne kaha ki piem ne jis tarah kii bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya he vah unke pad kii maryaada kam karne vaala he
 He said that people will not bless BJP again
 aage vah kabhi satta main nahin aa paaegi
 Banerjee warned PM Modi to stay in Kosima
 unhone kaha ki main aapaki gulam nahin hum or apni beijjati nahin sah sakati
 BJP mean terrible burn party Mamata Banerjee attacked Modi and asked who is going to bear the expenses of the crowd attending your program on a foreign tour
 main aapaki tarah nahin bol sakati
 Keep accusing TMC of terror
 banerjee ne kaha ki main kah sakati hum ki bijepi matlab bhayanak jali party, lekin main apane shabd waapas leti hum
 i would not do politics of such accusations
 mujhe gaali die bina khate nahin bijepi netabanerjee ne kaha ki bhale hi koi mujhe jail main daal de lekin main jhukuungi nahin
 i am not afraid of death either
 yah meri marji he ki main dilli main kisase miluun yaa nahin miluun
 No one can try me
 unhone kaha ki mujhe gaali die bagaiyr bijepi netaaon kaa khaanaa nahin pachataa
 He will not let Bengal divide, he attacked PM Modi and said that i will not let him divide Bengal
 pradhanmantri kaa kaam desh bhar ke logon ko ek saath lekar chalane kaa hota he, lekin modiji unhen baantne kaa kaam karte hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that our government has come up with a historical scheme called Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi
 ye waisi yojana nahin jo congress har das varsh par lekar aati he
 Congress gets fever of debt waiver as soon as the elections are over
 unki yojana kaa laabh maatr 20 fisadi kisaanon ko hota tha
 But 90 percent farmers will get the benefit of our scheme, which will be available every year
 hamane jo yojana banaai he usase das saal main 7
 5 lakh crore rupees is going to be deposited directly in the account of farmers
 piem modi ne yah bhi kaha ki hamane gaay kii raksha ke liye kamdhenu ayog banane kaa faisla liya he
 For which a provision of Rs 500 crore has been made from the budget
 aise bada kaam tabhi sambhav ho sakate hai, jab seva bhav se aap kaam karte hai
 In the last four and a half years, there were many such works, which were only discussed
 ab jab yah jameen par aa gai he to ek vishwaas uthaa he ki modi he to mumkin he
 Many times he said, Modi is possible, Prime Minister Narendra Modi started the Bharatiya Janata Party's election campaign with Vijay Sankalp rally in Tonk, Rajasthan
 saal 2014 main piem modi ke chunavi abhiyaan kaa naaraa tha 'achche din aane vaale hai'
 But on this occasion, the Prime Minister gave a new slogan of 'modi hai to, mukmin hai' for the upcoming general election
 rajasthan ke up-mukhyamantri sachin payalat ke garh tonk main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue pie modi ne kaha ki rajasthan ke faujee bhaiyon ko yaad hoga ki kaise 40 saal tak unhen van rank, van pension par jhuthe vaade kiye gaye
 Today, such a thing does not suit the mouth of those who shed tears on the martyrdom of the soldiers
 hamaari sarkaar ne van rank, van pension lagu kiya 20 lakh purv phogiyon ko lagbhag 11,000 karod rupee ke arier bhi de die
 This work was done because 'modi is there, it is possible'
 piem modi ne kaha kabhi koi soch saktaa tha ki desh main aisi sarkaar aegi jo garib ke rasoi se dhue khatm karne kaa kaam karegi
 But under the Ujjwala scheme, 50 lakh families were given gas cylinders in Rajasthan
 unki rasoi se dhua khatm hua
 This has also worked, because 'modi is there, it is possible'
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki hamaare desh main garibon ko ghar dene kii yojana kai dashakon se chalati rahi, lekin koi thos kaam nahin hua
 Our government is moving at a fast pace in the direction of providing pucca houses to every homeless by 2022
 saadhe chaar saal main 1
 More than 5 crore poor families have been given the key of home
 ham lakshya kii taraf bad rahe hai or ise paakar rahenge
 This has been possible because 'if Modi is there, it is possible'
 jandhan yojana kaa zikr karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki kya koi soch saktaa tha ki saadhe chaar saal main rajasthan ke 2
 Bank accounts of 5 crore people will be opened
 ye hua he, kyonki 'modi he to, mumkin he'
 PM Modi said, similarly, could anyone have thought that people will get an insurance cover of 2 lakhs on a premium of just 1 rupee a month and 90 paise per day
 rajasthan main isse 70 lakh log jude
 This work has been done because Modi is possible
 isi tarah saamaanya varg ke garibon ko aarakshan kaa zikr karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki sarkari seva or shikshan sansthaaon main saamaanya varg ke garib bacchon ko aarakshan ke sawaal par dashakon se maang ho rahi thi
 But nobody made a serious effort to amend the constitution
 iske peeche niyat kii kami bhi thi or bina bahumat vaali sarkaar kii majaburi bhi thi
 But today ten percent reservation to the poor has become a reality
 yah kaam bhi isiilie hua kyonki modi he to mumkin he
 This reservation system has been tampered with by the reservation already being received
 chhattisgarh ke narayanpur jile main kadenar camp main itibipi ke ek jawan mosuddul rahamaan ne apane hi saathi javaanon par andhadhundh goliyaan barasaa deen
 Six soldiers died and three were injured in the incident
 sabhi jawan indo tibetan border police force (itibipi) kii 45 batalian ke hai
 However, the firing jawan also died in this firing
 bastar ke aiji sundarraj pi
 Has currently refused to give any reason
 unhone kaha jaanch kii ja rahi he
 As soon as the reasons are known, they will share it with the media
 lekin grih mantri tamra dhvaj sahu ne bina jaanch report yah saaf kar diya he '' aapasi vivaad kaa hona is ghatana ke peeche kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 In any case, not getting holidays is not the reason for this accident because the holidays are fixed for the soldiers
 baaki report aane ke baad sthiti or saaf ho jaaegi
 "on the other hand, the state home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu is saying," Not getting holidays is not the reason for this incident
 '' haalanki abhi jaanch report aani baaki he
 But an ITBP insider said on condition of anonymity, "he had not been discharged for more than a year
 ve lagaataar-lagaataar chuttee kii maang kar rahe the
 He was upset for the last several months
 '' usee batalian ke jawan ne bhi isi baat kii pushti karte hue kaha, ''batalian main aise or bhi log hai jinhen ek saal se zyada samay se chuttee nahin mili he
 Mutual skirmishes and fighting between stressed soldiers is an everyday matter here
 '' itnaa hi nahin us jawan ne bataaya ki grahamantri bayaanbaji band kar javaanon kii chhuttiyon kii argiyaan manjuur karavaaen nahin to mumkin hai or bhi log uthaaen aise kamad
 "earlier incidents too - a similar incident took place in Jammu and Kashmir's Udhampur in March this year
 yahaan central rigerv police force (siarpief) kii 187veen batalian ke camp main javaanon ke bich kisi baat ko lekar hui bahes dekhte hi dekhte khooni jhadap main badal gai thi
 The mercury of a jawan rose so much that he roasted three companions with his service rifle and killed him and later shot himself as well
 -isse pehle janvari main jammu-kashmir ke hi srinagar main siarpief ke ek jawan ne apane do saathiyon ko goli maarane ke baad khud ko bhi goli maar lee thi
 In Chhattisgarh, two years ago such an accident happened
 yahaan bijapur jile main chintalnar ilaake main siarpief kii 168veen batalian ke ek jawan ne apane saathiyon par goliyaan chalaa di thim
 Four soldiers were killed in this incident
 kendriya grih mantralay ke circular kaa kya hua?may, 2015 main kendriya grih mantralay ne centre armd police forcej (siepes) ko ek dishanirdesh jari kaha tha ki desh ke das lakh paramilitary ke javaanon ke liye rojaanaa yogabhyas jaruri kiya jaae
 The CAPFS includes Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF), Border Security Forces (BSF), Central Industrial Security Forces (CISF), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), National Security Guard (NSG) and Indo Tibetan Border Police Force (ITBP)
 siepes kii taraf se yah dishanirdesh sabhi forcej ke dijis ko jari kiye gaye the
 These dgs were also required to send a report of yoga exercises to the ministry
 chhattisgarh, police mahanideshak (dijipi) di
 M
 avasthi ne bataaya is tarah ke nirdesh die gaye the
 Yoga is also done at some places
 yoga camp main javaanon ko bheja jaataa he
 But the difficulty is that it is not possible to send everyone together
 kai baar kai jawan dudy par hote he to kuch chuttee par
 What yoga instructors have been appointed to train the jawans? On this, he said that yoga instructors have not been appointed
 lekin campon main log jate hai
 He said that the reason behind such incidents is mostly stress
 dm avasthi kehete hai, ‘‘do saal pehle jab siarpief ke ek jawan ne apane saathi javaanon ko goli maar di thi, tab jaanch team main ve bhi shaamil the
 At that time, home stress or the tension between the team was found to be the primary reason
 kai baar company commander kuch logon ko zyada tavajjo dete hai to kuch ko kam
 The duty of some people is continuously imposed
 siarpief kii ghatana ke samay yah kaaran nikal kar aayaa tha
 Suicide cases also keep coming
 in maamalon main aksar aisa paaya jaataa he ki yaa to jawan chuttee main jane kii taiyaari kar rahaa hota he yaa phir ghar se chuttee puri kar aayaa hota he
 Who should tell the jawans who are living under stress? a review report on the causes of tensions between the military was released in an article published in August 2014 in the Indian Defense Review Journal titled 'indian Army and Management of Stress'
 isame tanaav kaa mukhya kaaran akelaanpan, parivaar se dur rahanaa, team ke bich atinushasan or hyrarki kaa hona
 Many times, do not reach home during any crisis
 khaastaur par oonchai par yaa duurastha ilaakon main tainaat javaanon ke saamne akelepan kii samasya sabase zyada hot he
 In Naxalite areas or stressed areas, the threat of life always compels him to stay away from the family, increasing the mental pressure
 ise ‘pressure cooker effect’ kehete hai
 Sometimes all these reasons together add so much pressure that under stress, the youngsters commit suicide or they start firing on their own comrades
 kya tanaav se nipatane ke liye niyamit counselling ke liye counciller niyukt kiye gaye hai? dijipi dm avasthi kehete hai, ‘‘counslir niyukt kiye jane chahie lekin chhattisgarh main sarkaar kii taraf se to counciller niyukt nahin kiye gaye hai
 But perhaps the ITBP has counselors
 par main nishchit nahin hum
 Although DM Awasthi says, many times we do take the help of a private councilor
 itibipi main stress counciller hai magar
 
 
 According to itbp's Personal Relations Officer (PRO) Vivek Pandey, only ITBP in Chhattisgarh is a paramilitary force with stress councilors
 lekin kya stress counciller kii sankhya itibipi ke javaanon kii sankhya ke mukaable kaaphi he? pandey kehete hai, ‘‘ chhattisgarh main kareeb 12,000 itibipi ke jawan tainaat hai
 There are about 10-11 battalions
 Each battalion consists of 1000-1200 personnel
 or har batalian ke liye ek stress counciller niyukti kiya jaataa he

 kendriya mantri ne bharat band ke dauraan bihar kejahanabadamein hui bacchee kii maut par sawaal uthaae, unhone kaha ki aakhir is maut kaa jimmedaar koun he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the Congress and other opposition parties are getting angry and creating an atmosphere of fear
 jab janata kaa samarthan nahin mil rahaa he to ugrata sahaara liya ja rahaa he
 Everyone has the right to protest, but how much violence is justified in this way
 vipaksh ko hinsa kaa tandav band karnaa chahie
 Prasad said that Kairahul Gandhi will take responsibility for the girl who died in Bihar
 aaj petrol-deazal ke daam par sarkaar bhi chintaa main hai, ham isko kam karne ke liye jaruri kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Whatever petrol-diesel prices have increased now, they are increasing due to all international reasons
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki 2009 se 2014 ke bichpetrol39 se 73 rupye tak pahunchaa he, hamaari sarkaar main bhi kuch badha he lekin pehali sarkaar jitna nahin badha he
 Our government has stopped inflation, in which we have also got success

 yoga pranali main cancer koshikaon ko samaaj main crimanal ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 These groups of cells prove to be dangerous
 kyonki yah badi dikkat paidaa kar sakate hai
 Similarly, cancer cells are present in our whole body, but some of them do not affect our life or body in that way
 jab tak ve akeli hon to koi samasya nahin
 However, when these cells start growing, they start to have a bad effect on our health
 aakhir kyon hota he cancer?yoga main aamtaur par ham ise is tarah dekhte hai jaise insaan ke vyavhaar, khan-paan, jeevanstyli yaa kinhin duusari vajahon se jab urja main kuch khaas kism kaa khalipan paidaa ho jaataa he to hamaare sharir main cancer koshikaon ke badhane kaa khatra banataa he
 If the flow of energy in a particular part of the body is not right, then the cancer cells choose that place to hide and thrive
 cancer koi bimaari nahin, balki isamen kuch koshikaayen aapke khilaaf ho jaati hai or isse aapkaa sharir hi aapke khilaaf kaam karne lag jaataa he
 Cancer prevention: The easiest way to prevent cancer-infected cells in the body is to keep fast on time
 in koshikaon ko saamaanya koshikaon se zyada poshak tatwon kii jarurat hoti he or kuch khaas din khud ko bhojan se dur rakh kar aap sharir main cancer sankramit un koshikaon kii sankhyaon ko kam kar sakate hai
 You can also take pills made of neem and turmeric paste daily
 yah cancer peedit vyakti ke liye bhale ek upachaar naa ho, lekin yah sharir main cancer koshikaon kii sankhya ko kaabo main rakhte hai, jisase ve sharir ke khilaaf ekajute nahin ho paati hai
 When their levels increase in the body, they inhibit the flow of energy in the cells and there is an increased risk of cancer cells growing in those parts of the body where energy cannot flow
 neem or haldi ke ek saath seven se yah urja vistaarak ke taur par kaam karata he
 Ophthalmologists use extensors such as to spread the pupils of the eyes
 vaise hi neem or haldi hamaare sharir main usee tarah kaam karte hai or sharir ke andar har ek chhidr main urja ke pravaah or use bharne main madad karte hai
 Yoga and Cancer There are also some special spiritual methods, which can help in improving and balancing the body system
 ham nahin bataa sakate hai ki cancer se peedit marijon ke liye yah tareeke kis had tak madadgaar hote hai, lekin hamane kai aise marijon ko jarur dekha hai jo in upayon kii badaulat puri tarah thik ho gaye hai
 We have also seen people who have recovered very rapidly after chemotherapy through yoga
 un marijon kaa ilaaj kar rahe doctor bhi unhen dekh kar dang rah gaye
 Here it cannot be said with certainty that his cancer has been cured due to yoga, but by doing yoga with medical treatment, cancer patients have definitely benefited

 But placing a bet on comedy itself, the channel brought in a show with their Rival Comedians
 ye he drama company jisamen krishna abhishek, sudesh lahari, sugandha mishra jaise chehre najar aa rahe hai

 The show may be full of stars but in terms of format and punch, it does not sit anywhere close to Kapil Sharma's show
 kabhi krishna or sudesh kii jodi ko dekhakar logon kii hansi nahin rukati thi lekin ab ye bor kar rahi he
 Although the show shows comic actors calling different stars of the genre, the audience is not impressed by it
 'daadi' ne chhod diya tha kapil sharma kaa sho, aise ho sakati he vapasisho ke mekars bhi khush nahin hamedia reports ke anusaar sho ke mekars bhi isaki kam popularity se khush nahin hai isliye krishna abhishek ko host kii seat se utaar diya gaya he

 Why Kapil Sharma in depression despite a successful career? Somewhere this reason cannot be known: In the Kapil's show, Ali Asgar, who was recently seen in The Drama Company, seems that somewhere he has made up his mind to return to Kapil's show
 ali ne kaha tha ki da kapil sharma sho main apane kirdaar ko kam spes milane kii vajah se vah naaraaz the
 He had already decided to leave the show before Kapil's fight with Sunil

 is sho kaa soshal media base kaaphi bada he or aise main kapil jab bhi kuch oonch-neech karte hai phens unhen thik karwaane khadey ho jate hai
 While the show has been made for Family Entertainment, people protested against Kapil and his show for making lewd jokes about the body of the show's judge Archana Puran Singh
 jahaan archana ko dekhakar lagata he ki ve sari baaten majaak main leti hai vahiin soshal media par phens ko kapil or baaki logon kaa archana ke bare main aise baat karnaa pasand nahin aata he
 They feel insulted by Archana in this
 lekin baari virodh ke baad mekars ne archana pooran singh par banaae jane vaale jokes ko kam karne kaa faisla liya he
 According to reports, the makers do not want trps to have any impact whatsoever

 In the caption of this photo, he wrote, 'love you ma'am Archana Puran Singh

 After this post, people felt that Kapil is apologizing to Archana for his actions in gestures
 isi ke saath sho ke mekars ne archana kii taraf saadhe jane vaale jokes ko kam karne kaa faisla bhi le liya he

 bhale hi wo archana kaa style ko, unke luks yaa phir unki hansi, da kapil sharma sho ke kamedian unka majaak banane main kabhi peeche nahin hatate
 In such a situation, many fans tagged Kapil Sharma on Twitter and said that they are stopping watching Kapil's show for this reason
 yugers se bataaya ki kaise kapil kii aisi baaten or jokes sunakar unka man uth jaataa he
 Along with this, he also requested that Kapil and his team stop doing so
 yugers ne ye bhi kaha ki archana kaa majaak udata dekh unhen bura lagata he or ve is sho ko ab nahin dekhnaa chaahate

 Defense Minister AK Antony has confirmed the deaths due to fire in the warship INS Sindhurakshak, but he did not give any information about the casualties

 Arvind Kejriwal is preparing to fight in court after 20 Aam Aadmi Party mlas are disqualified in the post of profit together, on the other hand, he has asked the party to be ready to go to the public court 
 itnaa hi nahin arvind kejariwal khud ab janata kii adaalat main jaakar apane vidhayakon ke nilamban ko mudda banaate hue prachaar mod main dikhaai dene lage hai
 AAP trying to convince angry mlas on Sunday, Arvind Kejriwal attacked the bjp's central government without mentioning the suspension of his legislators during the inauguration at a meeting in Najafgarh, then on Monday in a meeting of Bhikariwalvazirabad, absolutely his old propaganda mode Appeared in kejariwal kii sabha main unke saath manch par party ke vidhayak pankaj pushkar dikhaai die
 Pankaj Pushkar's platform sharing with Arvind Kejriwal is confirmed by the party's sources to Aaj Tak, which claimed that the party has rejoined all the legislators sidelined
 isamen timarpur se aam aadmi party ke vidhayak pankaj pushkar or dakshini dilli se aane vaale karnal devendra saharaavat bhi shaamil he
 The party has persuaded its old legislators who are on the sidelines and sitting angry
 kya kaha arvind kejariwal ne?timarpur main saraswati puja ke maukey par yojit sabha main pahunche arvind kejariwal ne sabase pehle apni sarkaar dwaara kiye ja rahe kaamon ko ginvaaya
 After mentioning the works ranging from the betterment of government schools to the laying of water pipelines, Kejriwal put the issue of cancellation of the qualifications of 20 of his mlas in the public and said that he and his party are constantly being harassed
 is
 kejariwal ne kaha ki vah pehle mukhyamantri hai, jinke daftar par sibiai chapa maaraa gaya lekin us chaape main sibiai ko mafalar ke alaava kuch nahin mila
 The funny thing is that Kejriwal appeared in this gathering for the first time this year
 mafalar main kejariwal ne shungalu cameti kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki unki sarkaar ke 2 saal main liye gaye 400 faislon kii copy uparajyapal ne mangvayi lekin maheenon lambii chali jaanch-padtaal main unhen kuch bhi nahin mila
 Kejriwal accused the central government of not naming that he suspended 20 Aam Aadmi Party mlas when they found nothing
 kejariwal ne is sabha main bhi daawa kiya ki sansadeey sachiv ke taur par niyukt unke kisi vidhayak ko sarkaar ne gaadi bangala tankhwaah yaa koi suvidha nahin di balki yah sabhi vidhayak apana paisa kharch karke skool or aspataalon kaa muyna kar ke khud mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko report dete the

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh says that the full credit for the victory in Karnataka goes to Rahul Gandhi
