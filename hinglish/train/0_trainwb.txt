 kapil ne patr main amit shah se poocha he ki mangalvaar ko jammu kashmir kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ji se mila
 i asked him four questions
 maine unase poocha ki kya wo burhan vaani ko aatankwaadi maanati he? kya afjal guru ko aatankwaadi maanati he? kashmir main rojaanaa hamaare vir jawan bharat mata kii jai bolkar shahid ho rahe hai, kya mahabuuba mufti bharat mata kii jai bolengi?kapil mishra ne likhaa he ki chaar main se in teen sawaalon kaa unhone koi jawaab nahin diya, or unka jawaab kya he, ye aap bhi jaanate hai or sara desh bhi
 Fourth question i asked him about the slogans in the JNU supporting anti-country and Afzal Guru
 iskaa unhone jawaab diya ye kahkar ki uniwarsity main aise naare laganaa demokrasi kaa hissaa he
 i wrote a letter to you on 25 March, and asked you the same question as to why BJP is forming government with them even when Mehbooba Mufti and her party PDP is openly anti-national and supporter of terrorists
 aapane koi jawaab nahin diya
 Questions were arising that under the pressure of Mehbooba Mufti, the Kashmiri boys who raised slogans in the JNU, the central government decided not to take any action against them
 mangalvaar ko mahabuuba mufti ne bhi aisa hi ishaara kiya ki wo nahin chaahati JNU vaale mudde par koi karrwai ho
 What is this, sir? Where did the big things of patriotism and patriotism of the BJP go
 satta ke liye itnaa bada samjhauta ?ye to puure desh ke saath dhokhaa he
 Kapil Mishra has asked that just think what will be the effect on the morale of our army when they come to know that the terrorists they fight, the terrorists whom they kill
 mukhyamantri unhen aatanki maanati hi nahin
 Kapil Mishra has asked that think how sad the soldiers will be knowing that the ruling BJP of the country is supporting such people who make Burhan Wani and Afzal Guru a hero
 sena ke javaanon par kya bitati hogi jab wo aapako mehabooba mufti ke saath hansate, batiyate, sarkaar chalaate dekhte hongen jis din ISI vaale pathankot kii jaanch karne aaye us din sena kaa kitna manobal tutaa hoga
 How many martyrs' souls will suffer in that dark day
 aise log jo aatankiyon ke prati soft corner rakhte he unase dosti kii majaburi kya he? kya jin sawaalon ke jawaab mahabuuba mufti ne nahin die, unke jawaab aap denge? iske alaava kapil mishra ne patr main pakistan se most fevar nesan kaa darja abtak na chhinane par bhi sawaal uthaaye
 At the end of the letter, Kapil Mishra has also asked Amit Shah 2 questions - 1
 sadan kaa satr bulaakar pakistan ko aatanki raashtra ghoshit karne se aapako kisne roka he? kyon nahin ghoshit karte pakistan ko aatanki desh? 2

 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has issued a statement saying that there is better coordination among the top leaders of the grand alliance
 bihar kii nyaaypriy janata ne mahagathbandhan kii nitiyon or kaaryakramon ko apaar samarthan evam anant sammaan dekar aitihaasik bahumat diya he
 This majority is devoted and committed to public concerns
 bijepi or unke samarthak sansthaanon ko hamaari ekta hajam nahin ho rahi he
 The Grand Alliance will have the most important role in defeating the BJP in 2019
 iske alaava gathbandhan ke bhi kuch netaa vyaktigat hiton ko lekar anaavashyak bayaanbaji karte rahete hai taaki ve khabaron main bane rahen
 Tejaswi said that there are some people in every party who keep their personal interests paramount by not supporting Mandate or public sentiment
 aise logon kii apni vyaktigat dharanaen or pidaaen hoti he jinhen ve media ke marfat dal or gathbandhan se jod dete hai
 However, this is not the case in reality
 media main kisi dal kaa mantavya keval uske aadhikarik pravaktaa hi de sakate hai
 They say that many letters have also been sent on behalf of the state president to all media establishments on behalf of his party
 usamen spasht rup se yah kaha gaya he ki kevalanamit pravaktaahi party se sambaddh masalon par aadhikarik bayaan dene ke liye adhikrut hai lekin phir bhi us nivedan or soochna kaa paalan unke dwaara nahin kiya jaataa or wo apane pasand ke anaadhikrut vyakti se bayaan lekar use party kaa aadhikarik bayaan bataakar chalaa dete hai
 The media also needs chilli-masala, so run the statement of a person who is not nominated to speak on behalf of the party
 ve aage kehete hai ki kuch aise logon par party kii taraf seanushasanamak karrawihui he or aage se kisi ke ulanghan par bhi karrwai hogi
 They say that even if their party is a mass party, they will not compromise on discipline and will take action against anyone who tries to link one's personal intent and interest with the party's vote
 gathbandhan par bayaan dene kaa adhikaar kisi vidhayak yaa netaa ke bajaay sirf rashtriya adhyaksh ke paas surakshit he
 In any case, the issue related to the alliance is a matter of national presidents of the three parties
 aise main us par kisi prakaar kii tippanee karnaa shobhaneey nahin he
 If anyone has any kind of problem, it should be talked about on the platform rather than the media
 ve ise lekar atyant gambhir hai
 He further said that the Grand Alliance is strong and unbreakable like the Himalayas
 bihar jeetne kii bhaajapai manshaa kabhi puri nahin hone vaali he
 The Grand Alliance of Bihar is the most beautiful and positive chapter in the current politics of the country
 isi mahagathbandhan kii dein he ki november 2015 se lekar march 2017 tak desh aman chaiyn or bhaichaare se ji rahaa tha anyathaa upi chunaav ke baad se to puraa desh main araajaktaa or dehshat ke maahaul main hi ji rahaa he
 Who knows when a bunch of three people kill someone in the name of religion, food, dress or pseudo nationalism? The bjp-sponsored mob has turned democracy into a democracy
 isliye puure desh ke kshetreey dalon par vahaan kii nyaaypriy va amanpsand janata kaa bhi dabaab he ki wo bihar kii tarah mahagathbandhan karen or desh todane vaali phacist takaton ko parrast karen
 For those who are hoping to break the Grand Alliance, this much has to be said that this dream is not going to be fulfilled
 2019 main bijepi ko haraane main mahagathbandhan kii sabase ahm bhoomika hogi
 To save the country and the constitution, they are trying to bring all egalitarian and socialist parties together

 guuruuvaar ko jab ye maamla saamne aayaa to vipaksh ne ek baar phir modi sarkaar ko nishane par liya, lekin grih mantralay ne kaha he ki ye sirf sarkaar ko badnaam karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 Indian journalists were targeted by spyware named Pegasus by an Israeli company, which includes more than 2 dozen journalists, lawyers and celebrities
 agar duniyabar main is aankade ko dekhen to ye number kareeb 1400 tak jaataa he
 Now Pegasus's documents are coming out, it is revealing that this espionage is not limited to whatsapp only
 in dastavezon main daawa kiya gaya he ki Pegasus spiver kaa khel watsape ke alaava cell data, skip, telegram, vibar, esemes, photo, email, contact, lokation, files, history browzing or mike-camera tak ko apane kabje main le saktaa he
 The data of the camera, mic of the target phone number can be collected by this spyware

 What has been the action on behalf of the government? Ever since the matter came to light, the Modi government has come into action
 centre sarkaar ne watsape se 4 november tak is maamle main safai dene ko kaha he
 Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that the government is serious in this matter and whatsapp has been asked for an answer in this regard
 bharat sarkaar logon kii privesi ko protect karne ke liye tatpar he
 He said that central agencies operate under the protocol, which includes senior officials of the central and state governments
 ye kaam rashtrahit main kiya jaataa he
 On the other hand, a strict statement has been given by the Union Home Ministry on this issue
 MHA kaa kahana he ki media main watsape ke jariye jasusi kii jo khabaren chal rahi hai, vah bharat sarkaar kii chhavi kharaab karne kaa prayaas he
 The Government of India respects the right of citizens to privacy, the strictest action will be taken in this matter

 Opposition has started besieging the government after the case surrounded the government
 congress ke rahul gandhi ne is masale ko rafel vivaad se jod diya he, to vahiin randeep surajevaala ne bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki bijepi sarkaar kii is harakat se vah hairaan nahin hai
 What do the experts say? Cyber security expert Abhishek Sharma says that the common man cannot do much in this matter
 haalanki, unhone ye bhi kaha ki hekking kii takanic itani zyada advance he ki watsape isamen kuch nahin kar paaya
 But whatsapp should also take care that nothing like this happens from now on
 unhone salaah di ki logon ko aplication ko samay dar samay apadet karte rahanaa chahie
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda had to suffer the brunt of sharing the stage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kaithal
 siem chavaan kaa kahana he ki wo 21 agast ko nagpur metro ke udghaatan main piem ke saath manch saajha nahin karenge
 Actually, Bhupendra Singh Hooda shared the stage with PM Modi in Kaithal
 is dauraan main hooda ke khilaaf jamkar hooting hui
 Obviously, Chief Minister Hooda will bifurcate
 hooda ke hashr ke baad congress ke duusare mukhyamantri pradhanmantri modi ke saath manch saajha karne se kataraane lage hai
 Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan shared the stage with Modi on the occasion of dedicating INS Kolkata to the country, but it may not happen at the inauguration of Nagpur Metro on August 21
 mukhyamantri chavaan ne aise hi sanket die hai
 CM Chavan said on the phone to Aaj Tak, 'even before PM had come to the program in Maharashtra and he violated the dignity there too but then i kept quiet according to the dignity of PM
 lekin wo baar-baar sarkari kaaryakramon ko raajnneetik rang de rahe hai
 So, as he did in Haryana, i will not go to his next program
 'congress alaakaman bhi haryana ke mukhyamantri kii hooting se baukhala gai he
 Has instructed his Chief Ministers to follow the protocol but refrain from sharing the stage with the PM
 dilli kii ek adaalat ne sharaab pikar gaadi chalaane ke aaropee ek vyakti ko chah din kii jail kii sajaa ko sahi tehraate hue kaha he ki sharaab pikar gaadi chalaane vaale 'jinda aatmghaatee maanav bam' ke samaan hai
 Additional Sessions Judge Lokesh Kumar Sharma said this while dismissing the petition filed against the lower court verdict of Badarpur resident Jogi Varghese
 nichali adaalat ne us par 2000 rupee kaa jurmaana lagaate hue chah din kii sajaa sunai thi
 The sessions court said that this person is not entitled to be given any leniency as the lower court has rightly stated that the amount of alcohol found in his blood was 42 times more
 us samay vah ek dopahiyaa chalaa rahaa tha
 The comments adaalat ne kaha, ‘‘meri raay main, yachikakarta itane gahare nashe kii haalat main dopahiyaa chalaate hue kisi jinda aatmghaatee bam kii tarah kaam kar rahaa tha jo vaahan ko chalaate hue duusare logon kii jaan le saktaa tha
 And even if there was a slight mistake on the road, it could prove fatal for him
 ’’ adaalat ne sajaa puri karne ke liye use hiraasat main lene kaa aadesh diya
 The trial court had also revoked his driving license for six months and directed him to take a fresh driving efficiency test
 atirikt satr nyaayadhish lokesh kumaar sharma ne badarpur nivasee jogi vargeez kii nichali adaalat ke faisle ke khilaaf daayar kii gai yachika ko khaarij karte hue yah baat kahi
 He was sentenced to six days by a lower court with a fine of Rs 2000
 satr adaalat ne kaha ki yah vyakti kisi prakaar kii udaartaa barte jane kaa hakdaar nahin he kyonki nichali adaalat ne bilkul sahi kaha he ki uske rakt main mili sharaab kii maatra 42 guna adhik thi
 At that time he was driving a two-wheeler
 tippaniyan The court said, "in my opinion, the petitioner was acting like a living suicide bomb while driving a two-wheeler in such deep intoxication that could kill other people while driving the vehicle
" or sadak par jaraa si galati hone par yah uske liye bhi ghaatak sabit ho saktaa tha
 The court ordered his detention to complete the sentence
 sunwaayee adaalat ne uskaa driving license bhi chah maheene ke liye radd kar diya tha or use nirdesh diya tha ki vah nae sire se driving dakshata pariksha de

 vipakshi team par ek hi itnaa baari sabit hota he ki duusare ko kuch khaas karne kii jarurat nahin hoti
 Hashim Amla may not be considered as a stormy batsman as AB de Villiers, but his bat in the field of play is no less than that of de Villiers
 ireland ke khilaaf unhone mahaj 128 gend par 159 ran kii tufaani pari khel di
 He hit 16 fours and 4 sixes in his innings
 ye unke vanade kariyar kaa 20waan shatak he
 You can guess from the pace at which Amla is scoring, that he has played only 108 innings to reach 20 centuries
 yani har paanch pari main ve ek shatak bana rahe hai
 There is no other sight around them at this speed
 viraat kohli ko itane hi shatak ke liye 133 vanade pari khelni padi
 AB de Villiers is far behind Amla in this matter, he had to play 175 odis for his 20 ODI centuries
 amala isi raftaar se sabase kam vanade maichon main paanch hajaar ran puure kar chuke hai or chah hajaar ran ke kareeb pahunchate ja rahe hai
 Among batsmen scoring more than five thousand runs, his career average is more than 56, which is the best in the world
 itnaa hi nahin vanade main ve teen baar 150 ran se zyaada kii pari khel chuke hai
 Amla is also in her rhythm in this World Cup and with her AB de Villiers is also scoring runs in a stormy manner
 westeindies ke khilaaf unhone tufaani shatak banaaya tha
 He has shown the fastest 150 runs in the World Cup and just before the World Cup, the feat of a century off 31 balls will be recorded in the record book for a long time
 vanade cricket kii is jai-viru kii jodi ke chalate hi dakshin africa ko world cap khitaab kaa joardaar daavedaar mana ja rahaa he
 It remains to be seen whether the jay-veeru duo can make their team a champion under the leadership of a 'thakur' (coach) like Gary Kirsten
 injuri time ke antim minute main daage haris ceferovich ke gol se switzraland ne pichhadane ke baad joardaar vaapasi karte hue fifa vishwa cap ke group i match main ecuador ko 2-1 se haraa diya
 World number six Switzerland were trailing 0–1 after the first half, but Admir Mehmedi scored the goal in the 48th minute while Seferovich (90 plus three minutes) ensured his team's victory
 mehamedi ne sthanapann khilaadi ke rup main utarane ke sirf 121 second ke bheetar gol daaga
 Earlier, Inner Valencia gave Ecuador the lead in the 22nd minute from a header but his team failed to respond to Switzerland's attacks in the second half
 ek samay haalanki aisa lag rahaa tha ki match drow kii ore bad rahaa he lekin ceferovich ne antim lamhon main gol dagkar switzraland ko puure teen ank dilaa die
 This is Switzerland's first World Cup win against a South American opponent, having lost the last four matches
 ecuador ne match main sakaaratmak shuruuaat kii or velencia ne jab 22wein minute main team ko badhat dilaai to kai logon ko thodi hairaani hui hogi
 On a free kick from former captain Walter Iovi, Valencia pushed the ball inside the goal, beating Switzerland goalkeeper Diego Benaglio from the header
 switzraland kii team ko duniya kii 26wein number kii team ke khilaaf lay aane main pareshaani ho rahi thi or team ko pehla mauka lagbhag aadhe ghante baad mila lekin walentin stokar kaa header gol se kuch duuri se baahar nikal gaya
 The Switzerland team, however, gained confidence from the attack and took an aggressive stand
 madhyantar se das minute pehle captain goekhan inler ne acha move banaaya lekin unke shot ko ecuador ke golkeeper elexander dominguej ne naakaam kar diya
 For the top seed in the group, Sherden Shakiri from Switzerland also came close to scoring in the first half but his effort was not allowed to be successful by Dominguez
 madhyantar tak ecuador ne 1-0 kii badhat barkaraar rakhi
 However, the Swiss team completely dominated the second half
 mehamedi ne duusare half ke tisare minute main hi apni team ko barabari dilaa di
 Mehmedi scored on the corner of Ricadre Rodriguez, beating Dominguez with a header
 yah switzraland kii ore se unka doosraa antarrashtriya gol he
 Ecuador also retaliated after this
 jeffrasan montero ne daayen chor se move banaaya or switzraland ke dephence ko chhakaate hue acha mauka banaaya lekin unke prayaas ko benaglio ne naakaam kar diya
 Switzerland also continued the attack and Josip Durmik delivered the ball into the goal but the referee called his effort off-side
 donon main se koi bhi team drow se santosh karne ko taiyaar nahin thi or ant tak hamale karti raheen
 Michael Arroyo made a good move on behalf of Ecuador but before he could make it difficult, Wallon Behrami dropped him and thwarted his effort
 match iske baad jab injuri time main khinchaa to drow kii sambhaavnaaen bad gai lekin ceferovich ne baayen chor se mili paas par gend ko gol main pahunchaa diya or switzraland ko puure teen ank dilaa die

 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter to the Urban Development Ministry of Delhi and asked him to prepare a feasibility report on how a referendum can be held to give Delhi full statehood
 yaad rahe ki kejariwal is saal farvari main jaise hi siem bane the unhone apni pehali mulaaqaat main hi piem narendra modi ke saath ke mudda uthaaya tha
 Also, in many meetings with Kejriwal on behalf of the Home Minister, the issue of full state continued to arise
 tippaniyan Ever since Kejriwal has come into the government, he has been demanding more rights for himself as Delhi does not have full state status and hence it is not clear here today what are the rights of an elected government and an appointed LG
 And up to where
 isliye maamla court main chal rahaa he
 This issue is important from the political point of view as BJP was earlier demanding full statehood status to Delhi, but in the assembly elections 2015, it stopped demanding that even BJP could not bring its manifesto because There were differences within the BJP itself on this demand
 dilli ke siem aravind kejariwal ne dilli ke shahari vikaas mantralay ko chitthee likhakar kaha ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaane ke liye kis tarah se janamat sangrah karavaaya ja saktaa he is par ek physibility report taiyaar karen
 Remember that Kejriwal had raised the issue with PM Narendra Modi in his first meeting as soon as he became CM in February this year
 saath hi kejariwal kii taraf se grahamantri ke saath uske baad bahut si baithak main purna rajya kaa mudda uthta rahaa

 Therefore, the matter is going on in court
 raajnneeti ke lihaaj se ye mudda mahatvapurn he kyonki bijepi pehle dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene kii maang kar rahi thi, lekin vidhansabha chunaav 2015 main usne ye maang band kar di or yahaan tak baat ho gai ki bijepi apana menifesto bhi nahin laa pai kyonki is maang par bijepi main hi matbhed ho gaye the

 If 'gyani Ji' is accepted, from now on whenever you go home after drinking alcohol, your wife will not be able to say that you are drunk
 yahi nahin pulicekarmi bhi aapako khuleam sharaab pine par nashile padaarth ke seven ke aarope main giraftaar nahin kar paaenge
 It may sound bizarre to hear, but Surjeet Kumar does not consider knowledgeable liquor as a 'intoxicating' substance

 Brother! The minister's argument has power
 agar yahi baat he to mantri ji
 
 
 Why do not liquor be banned in Punjab like Gujarat
 sunne main bhale hi yah vicitra lage, lekin surajeet kumaar gyani sharaab ko 'nashila' padaarth nahin maanate hai
 Now you must be thinking, who are these learned men? So, his compliment is that he holds the rank of Health Minister in the Punjab Government

 thik usee din jab donald trump ke prashasan ne apni pehali rashtriya suraksha ranneeti se paradaa uthaaya or usamen bharat ko ''awwal vaishvik takat or zyada majboot ranneetik tathaa pratiraksha bhagidaar" bataaya or china ko ''pratidwandvi" qaraar diya, china ne bhi aahista se ek elaan kiya
 People's Liberation Army (PLA) officials on December 18 confirmed for the first time that China was planning to explore "more foreign military posts in Africa, West Asia and other areas"
 " china kaa yah kadam july main jibooti main udghaatit piele ke pehle videshi sainya adde se aage kaa kadam hoga
 PLA advisors told the South China Morning Post that its aim is to "protect (china's) growing overseas interests in the Indian Ocean region"
 yah elaan us vakt aayaa jab trump prashasan ne apni taraf se hind mahaasaagar kshetra (ioaar) or asia-prashanth main china ke behad teji se badhate asar or maujuudagi kaa pukhta virodh karne ke liye ek yojana kaa khaakaa pesh kiya
 China and Russia were clearly identified as "rival forces" in Trump's strategy
 aisi takatein jo ''america suraksha or khushhaali kii jaden khodne" main mubtila hai
 The Trump administration said it would "undertake to increase all-round cooperation with Japan, Australia and India" and help South Asian countries maintain their sovereignty "at a time when China is increasing its influence in the region
" "ranneeti main yah baat ankahi chhod di gai he ki washington yah kaam kaise karegaa, khaskar tab jab trump ke kaarykaal ke pehle saal main kai desh china ke aarthik ghere main or zyada teji se gahare khinchate chale gaye hai
 The US president kept on chanting "america First" and also removed the US from the trans-pacific Partnership Trade Agreement which was the biggest cut in combating China's economic influence in the region
 aarthik morche par china apni van belt, van road buniyadi dhaancha pariyojnaon ke saath takat or teji se aage bad hi rahaa he
 The indications are that six months after opening its first cross-border military base in Djibouti, China is working on an ambitious plan to strengthen its remote outpost
 sitambar main piele ne jibooti registan main apane is nae adde par pehali live-fire drill ko anjaam diya
 This exercise was significant because it was the first cross-border live-firing deployment of the PLA since the Vietnam War in 1979 (separate from UN peacekeeping operations)
 european council on fahrren relations ke senior policy phelo mathew dushatil likhte hai ki china ke is badale hue ganit or samudr paar apane padchinh failaane kii gatividhiyon main haal kii teji ke peeche nirnaayak mode 2015 main aayaa, jab libya or yaman main uthal-puthal se dasiyon hajaar chini nagarikon ko bachaane or baahar nikaalane ke abhiyaan main piele ko lagaaya gaya
 According to Chinese planners and media reports, two more IOR bases are being considered after Djibouti
 bataaya jaataa he ki china kii seychelles ke saath shuruaati baatcheet ho chuki he, vahiin kai chini paryvekshak maanate hai ki pakistan main guadar swaabhaavik jagah hogi
 In addition, China is also building or caring for ports in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh
 dushatil kehete hai, ye tamaam ghatnakram bataate hai ki china kii videsh niti jabardast badlaav se guzar rahi he or vah ''gaiyr-dakhsandaji" kii apni paaramparik niti se hatakar aahista-aahista videsh niti ke ''sanyeekaran" kii taraf bad rahaa he
 The Chinese "garland of pearls" —the seaside military base at IOR — being laid with the intention of encircling India, have dominated the minds of strategists for many years
 aaj yah keval hindustan hi nahin he jo china ke ganit ko haank rahaa he balki duniya bhar main uske pairon kii badhati chhap use or aage badha rahi he
 The number of pearls is increasing and the garlands are getting longer

 The party's national president Amit Shah on Saturday termed the victory in the election results as historic and said that the mandate of 2019 has removed familyism, casteism and appeasement from politics
 aise main rashtriya janata dal (rjd)ke netaa shivanand tiwari ne parivaarwaad kii raajnneeti ko lekar bijepi par hamalaa kiya he
 In a post written on Facebook, he said that even in this election, familyism was dominated, then Ram Vilas Paswan's sons, Naveen Patnaik, Stalin and Jagan Reddy have won a tremendous victory in the election
 shivanand ne fasebuk post par likhaa, 'kaha ja rahaa he ki is chunaav kaa sandesh parivaarwaad kii raajnneeti ke kilaaf he
 Family politics is no longer going on
 lekin abhi sampann chunaavon main bhi dekha jaae to janata ne parivaar kii raajnneeti ko kaarij nahin kiya he
 If that were the case, how would Ram Vilas Paswan's family win the election in a wholesale price! urisa main naveen patnayak ne paanchavin baar mukhyamantri ban kar record banaaya he
 Naveen Patnaik's father Late Biju Patnaik was a big leader of the country

 NDTV: sanjay lila bhansaali kii boring film deepika ke saath nyaay nahin kartikandh english ne apni samiksha main bhansaali kii film padmavat ko boring bataaya he
 The film is long and slow

 Earlier, a senior party MLA had said that the party would support the nda-backed candidate, but the political equations have changed dramatically after BJP President Amit Shah's three-day visit to the state
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne somvaar-mangalvaar ko ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki tiares sarkaar centre kii yojanaayen garibon tak pahunchane main vifal rahi he

 Rao said that Telangana state owes a lot of revenue to the Center
 kesiar ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki amit shah tiares or rajya ke logon ke saath oche darje kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 He said that in the meeting to be held on May 27, it will be decided who the party will support in the presidential election

 unhone kaha tha ki centre kii modi sarkaar ne karondon rupee kaa fund rajya ko diya he lekin raav sarkaar uskaa sahi tareeke se istemaal karne main vifal rahi he
 Following these allegations by Amit Shah, state Chief Minister Chandrashekhar Rao on Wednesday held a press conference claiming to have falsely accused Shah
 raav ne kaha ki centre ko telugana rajya bahut adhik rajasav detaa he
 KCR also alleged that Amit Shah is doing low-level politics with the TRS and the people of the state

 Vijender Gupta said that if the government was really serious on the Outcome Budget, it should have made an analytical comment of 70 promises made in the election manifesto of the Aam Aadmi Party
 jisase dilli kii janata ko pataa lagata ki usne jis aadhaar par aam aadmi party ko dilli kii kaman saunpi thi wo lakshya kahaan tak or kitne puure ho paae hai
 Gupta said that the government cleverly rotated the whole thing and gave the entire presentation from its perspective
 jisamen sarkaar ne sirf apane matlab se chal rahiyojanaon kochuna or un par hue kaamon par outkam indicater or output indicater prastut kiye jo ki sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye kaamon ko sahi paripekshya main karne kaa tarika nahin tha
 Gupta said that the Outcome Budget would be meaningful only if the government gives its presentation honestly on all its election promises
 vijendra guptane aarope lagaaya ki up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne 500 skulon ke nirmaan, aspataalon main 30 hazaar atirikt bistaron kii vyavastha karne, 1 hazaar aam aadmi clinics banane, jagah-jagah aam aadmi canteen kholane, mohalla sabhaayen sthapit karne, 2000 nai basen kharidne, 50 hazaar mahila shauchalay banane or puri dilli main vaai-faai sthapit karne jaise vaayadon par to pregentation hi nahin diya
 While these promises were made before the elections, a large number of youth and women votes were garnered
 lekin beete 3 saal main sarkaar main isapar kuch kaam nahin kiya isliye outkam bajet main se ye sabhi chizein nadaarad raheen

 Next time if you yawn in front of others, be careful
 ek nae adhyayan main khulaasa hua he ki jamhai yaa ubaasi lenaa yon aaksharn kaa sanket he
 Until now it was believed that it is a means of disclosure of the desire to sleep
 paris main yojit pehle antarrashtriya jamhai sammelan main vaigyanikon ne daawa kiya ki insaan kii yah kriya vastav main ruchi dabaav or yahaan tak ki sex kii chahat sahit anya bhaawanaaon ko prakat kar sakati he
 According to 'the Telegraph', scientists have not yet been able to differentiate between the yawning process that reveals the need for arousal or getting some sleep
 is tathy ke baavjood ki ausatan har aadmi apane jeevankaal main do lakh 40 hajaar baar ubaasi letaa he is prakriya ke bare main adhikanshat: rahasy hi bana hua he
 Scientists do not yet know exactly why we take yawning, but the prevailing thinking of getting extra oxygen from it is completely wrong

 The perception of sexuality originated from ubiquity when Sintjens noted that many people had approached sex experts who yawned during sex or pre-sexual activity

 dilli main 15 saal tak lagaataar mukhyamantri raheen shila dikshit ko 2019 main phir pradesh congress kii kaman mili thi
 Even today, his acceptance was seen more in the rest of the Congress leaders in Delhi
 yahi vajah he ki 81 saal kii umr hone ke baavjood shila dikshit congress ke liye dilli main jaruri ban gai thim
 Her specialty was that she never backed down from her decisions
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke dauraan dilli main aam aadmi party (AAP) ke saath milakar chunaav ladane kii baat ho yaa mukhyamantri rahete vakt kaa koi faisla lenaa rahaa ho, shila ek baar jo nirnay le leti thim usase kabhi peeche nahin hatati thimyah sach he ki 2013 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaavon main shila dikshit ko aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal se shikast jhelni padi thi
 It is also true that in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Sheila Dixit was defeated by BJP state president Manoj Tiwari, yet Sheila Dixit's contribution to the Congress cannot be forgotten as she got the Congress so much vote share that the party came in second Arrived
 jis dilli main 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko 2013 main 8 siten mili thim or uske hi agle chunaav main yah sankhya shunya par pahunch gai
 In Delhi, in the Lok Sabha elections 2014 and 2019 also, the people put all the seats in the hands of the ruling BJP at the center
 shila dikshit ke netritv main congress ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main usee dilli main sattarudh aam aadmi party ko tisare paaydaan par bhej diya or zyaadaatar ilaakon main to jamaanat tak jabt ho gai
 Commenting here to pay tribute to Sheila Dixit, the most loved CM of Delhi, it was Shishila Dixit who stood firmly against Arvind Kejriwal's alliance with Aam Aadmi Party in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 jab nattejey aae to maaloom hua ki unka faisla kitna sahi tha
 Sheila Dixit believes that if the Congress makes an electoral agreement with the AAP in Delhi, then it will have to fall prey to the anti-incumbency against the current government of Delhi
 vah 100 fisadi sahi sabit huin
 Despite all the difficulties, Sheila Dixit was busy working hard for the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections
 shila dikshit ko sirf virdohi dal ke netaaon se hi nahin balki congress ke hi senior netaaon se lagaataar jujhna pad rahaa tha
 The feud between Sheila Dixit and Delhi incharge PC Chacko could not end till the end
 ek taraf wo apni sehat se jujh rahi thim or duusare morche par dilli prabharee chaako kii chitthiyon se
 Regardless of Chaco's letters, Sheila Dixit continued to strengthen the Congress in her own way
 unhone apane hisaab se jiladhyakshon kii niyukti bhi kar daali thi
 It is a different matter that Delhi Congress in-charge PC Chacko kept writing letters to Sheila Dixit till the end
 zyaadaatar patron main shila dikshit ke faislon ko palatney or nae aadesh kii hi baaten hua karti thim
 In a recent letter, PC Chacko had told Sheila Dixit that his health was not good, so let the executive presidents take decisions
 jaahir he ki shila dikshit aakhri dam tak congress ko majboot karne kii ranneeti bana rahi hongi, lekin afsos un par kabhi amal nahin ho sakegaa
 Sadly, PC Chacko will also have to write a letter to Sheila Dixit
 chhattisgarh kekondagaanvaki jila panchayat ke ek adhikari ke khilaaf sarkaar ne vishakha cameti ke tahat jaanch kii sifarish kii he
 They are accused that they used to harass their subordinate women employees by sending messages on whatsapp
 unke adhinsth teen mahilakarmiyon ne unpar yah aarope lagaaya he
 Women say that even after refusing, they used to send messages to them constantly
 yah aarope lagane ke baad unka fouran tabadalaa kar mantralay main atech kar diya gaya he
 At the same time, according to the Kondagaon District Panchayat Officer, the allegations that are being made on them are baseless

 The interesting thing is that instead of this Yogi government ministers can be fielded
 darasal, iske peeche ek badi vajah bataai ja rahi he
 According to sources, the BJP has conducted several surveys, in which it has been revealed that there is a lot of public opposition against most of the mps who won in the Modi wave
 yani log apane saansad ko pasand nahin kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, it has almost been agreed within the party that the MP whose functioning is not satisfactory or which is not popular among the people in his parliamentary constituency, will not be given a ticket again
 surakshit siton par cat sakate hai zyada tikatajhinake kaamkaaj ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, unamem zyaadaatar saansad aise bataae ja rahe hai jo duusari partiyon se aakar 2014 main chunaav jite the
 Apart from these, most mps of reserved seats are also being mentioned in this category
 yogi ke ye mantri lard sakate hai loksabhaa chunaavamaana ja rahaa he bijepi yogi sarkaar ke 10-12 mantriyon ko chunaav maidan main utaar sakati he
 According to party sources, there are many names including Rita Bahuguna Joshi, Brijesh Pathak, Swami Prasad Maurya, Dara Singh Chauhan, SP Singh Baghel who can turn up the election ground
 jaankaree ye bhi he ki agle do-teen dinon main bijepi pehle or duusare charan ke ummidavaaron kaa elaan kar sakati he
 It is believed that the party will give more than 1 month of campaign time to all its candidates
 bijepi ne karaae kai sarveybijapi ne loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar kai tarah ke survey karaae hai
 Apart from the survey conducted on the Namo app, the RSS has done surveys on its behalf
 jabaki party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke paas bhi zyaadaatar saansadon ke feedback alag se bheje gaye hai
 Apart from this, some agencies have also done surveys for BJP
 in sabhi survey main ek baat nikalakar saamne aa rahi he ki agar bijepi ko uttar pradesh jeetna he to jin saansadon ke khilaaf anti inakambency he, unka tikat kaatna hi hoga
 Now it has to be seen which BJP mps lose their tickets
 upi main sabhi saat charnon main matdaan hona he
 As part of the first phase, voting will be held on 8 April in eight seats of western UP

 com / i5prort5n8 Team India lost the winning game in the only T20 match of England tour
 haar ke baad twitor par kuch phans captain mahendra singh dhoni ko doshi tehra rahe hai, kyonki aakhri over main unhone atiaatmavishvaas dikhaate hue jaan-boojhkar single nahin liya
 India had to score five runs off the last two balls to win
 paanchavin gend par dhoni ne joardaar prahaar kiya
 Despite having a full chance of a single, he did not run for a run and sent Ambati Rayudu back at the other end
 ab jeet ke liye aakhri gend par dhoni ko chakka jamaana tha, jo ki vah nahin kar paae
 If Rayudu had come on strike, he would have got a boundary on the last ball
 isi 'atiaatmavishvaas' ke chalate dhoni kii soshal media par khub aalochana kii ja rahi he
 But he has defended this 'controversial' decision
 dhoni ne kaha ki vah gend ko middle kar paa rahe the jabaki rayudu nahin kar paa rahe the, aise main unhone khud hi strike rakhana behatar samajha
 a captain who doesn't trust his teammates to deliver does not deserve to be captain # Dhoni —the Bad Doctor (@doctoratlarge) September 7, 2014I guess Dhoni should now do all the batting and bowling for the entire team as well, and use the other players only as fielders — The Bad Doctor (@doctoratlarge) September 7, 2014dhoni refused "singles" because he is married

 is dauraan duusare chor par koi puchalla ballebaaj nahin, pichley vanade main ardhashatak jamaane vaale visheshgy ballebaaj ambati rayudu maujuud the
 Many times things do not go in your favor: Dhoni defended his decision, saying, 'in the last over, i missed at least two such shots on which i could make the boundary
 yah mushkil kaam tha or yah un dinon main se tha jab chijen aapke paksh main nahin jaatin
 He said, 'I felt that the ball was coming in the middle of my bat, so i should take responsibility but it did not happen
 rayudu usee samay aayaa tha jo genden usne kheli unhen vah 'middle' nahin kar paaya isliye maine sochaa ki mujhe jimmedaari leni hogi
 Dhoni said, "overall we chased the target well but we gave away a lot of runs in the last over whereas we bowled well in the middle overs

 1
 The festival of eid-ul-fitr is celebrated at the end of this month of Barkatas
 is puure maah muslim dharmavalambee rojaa, namaajon, taraavih, quran kii tilavat (padhanaa) kii pabandi karenge
 2
 ramajaan ke mahineko or teen hisson main baanta gaya he
 Every part comes ten days
 har das din ke hisse ko 'ashara' kehete hai jiskaa matlab arabi main 10 he
 In this month, the entire Quran descended from the sky, which is the culinary book of Islam
 3
 In the verse 183 of the second paragraph of the Quran, keeping fasting has been considered necessary for every Muslim
 rojaa sirf bhukhe, pyaase rahane kaa naam nahin balki galat kaamon se bachanaa he
 This means we have to keep ourselves in control both physically and mentally
 4
 In this happy month, any kind of quarrel or anger is not only forbidden, but it is advised to build unity in the society by apologizing to anyone who has been harassed
 5
 With this, it is said to be necessary to distribute a fixed amount or goods as zakat among the poor, which is very helpful for the society
 6
 In the month of Rosa, any type of intoxication is forbidden
 iske liye sakht pabandi he
 7
 rojaa ke dauraan kisi bhi stri ko galat najar se nahin dekh sakate, yahaan tak ki apni bivi ko bhi
 8
 vaise to jhooth bolnaa yun bhi galat he par ramajaan ke maheene main jhooth bolnaa, rishwat lenaa yaa koi bhi galat kaam karne kii sakht manaahi he
 This can be taken as an exercise so that after this one month, a person tries to avoid doing anything wrong throughout the year

 In the last three years, there has been a significant decline in the GDP of the country
 jidipi 2016-17 main 8
 Has fallen to 7% in 2018-19 as against 2%
 nai sarkaar kaa sabase mahatvapurn kaam hona chahie ki vah is thami hui arthvyavastha ko raftaar dene kaa kaam kare
 The Finance Ministry's explanation of the decline in GDP is: “the immediate factors are responsible for this slowdown
 nijee upbhog main giravat, sthaayee nivesh main utsaah kii kami or niryaat main susti kii vajah se aisa hua he
 In terms of supply, we face the challenge of stopping the decline in the growth of agriculture sector and maintaining the growth of industries
 ”jab puri arthvyavastha pakad se baahar najar aa rahi he, nijee upbhog behad mahatvapurn he jo lambey samay se vikaas kaa mukhya kaarak rahaa he
 It has contributed about 60 per cent to GDP (at current rates) during 2017-18 and 2018-19
 upbhog main giravat yah sanket detii he ki maang ghat rahi he or isko tatkaal punerjeevit karne kii jarurat he
 In this context, it is important to increase the income of the lower class population
 yah diarect cash transfar or duusare inakam saport system ke hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 This requires large-scale consultations and consultations
 kyon garibon kii aay badhanaa vikaas ke liye jaruri he'garibi' ab koi fishan nahin he
 In recent years, especially after 2008–09, income inequality has received worldwide attention, be it developed countries, developing countries or emerging developing countries
 nav-udaaravaadi aarthik niti kii samarthak sanstha antarrashtriya mudra kosh (IMF) ne is disha main mahatvapurn pahalakadami kii he, kyonki aay main asamanta badhane par isaki nav-udaaravaadi aarthik niti par hi sawaal uthte hai
 a 2016 study on neo-liberalism (neo-liberalism: Oversold?) Found that there are two things in neo-liberal policies that are increasing inequality and harming development rather than making it sustainable
 ye hai: desh kii seemaa ke baahar puunji ke pravaah se pabandi hataanaa or rajasav kii mitvyayita yani rajasav ghaataa kam karne ke liye sarkaar kaa kharch ghataate janaa
 In the context of India, French economists Thomas Piketty and Lucus Chancel say that India has moved more inequality since the mid-1980s, "since pro-industry, free-market policies have been implemented"
 isliye nav-udaaravaadi aarthik niti vaali shashan vyavastha or asamanta ke bich sirf ittaphacan sambandh nahin he, balki inkaa ghanishtha sambandh he
 GDP growth is related to rich-poverty Another report of the International Monetary Fund says that the income of rich and poor is related to GDP growth
 is report kaa nishkarsh he ki agar amiron kii aay main badhottaree hoti he to jidipi neeche jaati he, lekin yadi garibon kii aay badhati he to jidipi kii vikaas dar par iskaa ulta asar hota he, tab jidipi badhati he
 According to the report, "if the richest 20 percent of the people increase their total income, then GDP growth falls down
 kyonki tab laabh trical down ke tahat neeche tak nahin aata he
 Conversely, if the poorest 20% of the people increase their incomes, then GDP growth increases
 vibhinn aarthik, saamaajik or raajnneetik madhyamon se growth ke liye garib or madhya varg kaaphi myne rakhata he
 "it also added that inequality in income increases minimum use of human resources, decreasing investment, political and economic instability leading to crisis
 antarrashtriya mudra kosh kii ye reports bharat ke hit main hai, kyonki ve garibon kii aay ko badhaane ke liye punarvitaran pranali ko badhaava dene kaa suzav detii hai
 Every person in the society needs a guarantee of minimum income
 Recently in the Economic Survey 2016-17, it was suggested to increase the income of the poor through the redistribution system
 isamen universal basic inakam (UBI) program ko lekar kaha gaya ki “samaaj main har vyakti ko nunatam aay kii guarantee kii jarurat hoti he
 It provides a physical foundation and dignity with access to the basics necessary for life
 ”is survey main sabase amir 25 fisadi ko chhodkar 75 fisadi janata ko salanaa 7,620 rupee kii aay transfar karne kaa suzav diya gaya he
 But the subject was unnoticed until the Congress announced the Minimum Income Scheme (NYAY) during the Lok Sabha elections
 congress kaa kahana tha ki vah 'nyaay' ke tahat garibi hataane, garimapurna jivan sunishchit karne or upbhog badhaakar growth ko gatisheel banane ke liye sabase garib 20 fisadi logon ko salanaa 72,000 kii aay sunishchit karegi
 Under this, the bjp-led NDA government made a provision of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi program, under which farmers cultivating up to two hectares have to get Rs 6000 annually in three installments
 19 may ko jab voting khatm hui, tab lakhon kisaanon ko unki duusari kist mil chuki thi
 Meanwhile, the BJP in its manifesto said that this scheme will be extended to all farmers, even big farmers
 yah sanket karata he ki bijepi kaa prayaas voters ko rijhaane kaa zyada tha, na ki arthvyavastha ko punerjeevit karne kaa
 Apparently, the very poor - agricultural laborers - are not included in this scheme
 krishi kshetra par nirbhar kul jansankhya kaa 54
 9 percent are agricultural laborers
 yah sankhya kareeb 14 karod 43 lakh he
 While the number of farmers is 11
88 million
 haalanki, yah prayaas bekaar nahin he
 To revive the Indian economy, it is necessary to increase market demand
 lekin inakam saport ke labhaarthiyon kii sankhya badhaakar maang ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he, taaki growth tikaoo ho, iske liye ek vyapak niti banaae jane kii jarurat he
 Emphasis should be given on increasing social security under this income support system

 Public health facilities should be enhanced

 a statement issued by the Gujarat Chief Minister's Office said, "chief Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and assured him that there was no question of pressurizing the Sikhs to go back to Punjab

 Varun Gandhi was brought to the BJP during the 2004 election campaign by Pramod Mahajan
 isaki ghoshnaa karte hue unhone chutkala sunaaya tha, ''aadhi congress hamaare paas he or aadhi unke paas
 "actually the Gandhi surname is the USP of young Varun
 halanki bhaajapa main unki ek shart yah bhi thi ki ve apni tai sonia gandhi or bhai-bahan rahul priyanka ke khilaaf prachaar nahin karenge
 But he did not desist from making fun of his Tai
 apane bhaajapa main shaamil hone kii ghoshnaa karne ke liye bulaae gaye samvaadadaata sammelan main unhone kaha ki haalanki unke paas likhaa hua bhaashan he lekin ve ise padhenge nahin ''anyathaa aap sochenge ki main reader (padhane vaala) hum, leader (netaa) nahin
 "it was obviously a sarcasm on Tai Sonia who is known for reading a speech written in Parliament
" baad main mahajan ne majaak kiya ki chunki unhone apana bhaashan padhaa, isliye ve asli gandhi hai
 Feroze had a lot of intimacy with Varun's sister Priyanka
 kai saarvajanik avasaron par nanhe varun ko god main uthaae priyanka kii kai tasviren dekhne ko mil jaaengi khaskar indira gandhi kii jayanti par
 Therefore Priyanka's shock must have hurt her heart the most
 lekin buddha dharm kaa paalan kar rahi priyanka bhi utani hi aahat hui hongi
 But Sonia and Rahul Gandhi took care not to attack Varun
 jabaki tejatarraar menka ne sonia par hamale main kabhi sankoch nahin kiya
 Regarding the comparison of the two, Maneka would often tell reporters, "don't call it a fight between two daughters-in-law
" hamamen tulana kahaan he
 She has come as a Member of Parliament for the first time and i have been a Minister six times
 '' yah san 2001 kii baat he jab menka ko samskruti mantri ke pad se hataaya gaya tha
 According to then rumors, Maneka blamed Sonia for this when Maneka was removed
 unka daawa tha ki vaajapeyi ne congress adhyaksh ko khush karne ke liye unhen hataaya he, kyonki unhen sansad main kai vidheyak paarit karne ke liye congress kaa samarthan chahie tha
 Maneka had submitted a CAG report to the CBI which reported the fund scam at IGNCA, when Sonia used to be its chairman
 2004 main rahul amethi se apana pehla chunaav lard rahe the, varun ne haalanki uttar pradesh kaa daura kiya lekin ve gandhi parivaar ke garh kii ore nahin gaye
 But the BJP leadership was deeply impressed by this outspoken youth
 mahajan ne apane doston se kaha ki ''ise sari history yaad he
 "not only does Varun have a good memory, but his studies are also good
 mahajan ne 2004 ke maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav abhiyaan main unka istemaal kiya
 Varun wanted the BJP to pursue him in the same way as the Congress was promoting his brother Rahul
 jis din ve chunaav ladane ke yogya hue, ve chaahate the ki bhaajapa unhen vidisha upachunaav main khadaa kar de
 But by then the BJP had lost its fascination with this youth, who was very happy about himself
 party sutron ke mutabik laalkrishna adwani varun ko sanghathan main shaamil karnaa chaahate the or party sachiv bananaa chaahate the lekin is peshkash ko thukraa diya gaya kyonki sutron ke mutabik varun mahasachiv bananaa chaahate the
 But Advani has a soft corner for Varun in his mind
 shaayad isliye ki varun unki tarah padhaaku hai or apane bhaashanon main samayik lekhakon ke uddhran dete rahete hai
 Varun can be seen drinking heavily and arguing over politics in the luxurious coffee shop of Paye Hee Khan Market
 ek varisht bhaajapa netaa kaa kahana he, ''ve shisht hai, vinamr hai or jab tak aap chizon ko unke nazariye se dekhen ve bahut charming bhi hai

 He said that our agenda is to develop the state and we want to remove the poverty of the country
 'aaj tak' se nitin gadakari kii puri baatcheet padhein
 Question- Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh say that you people are doing politics of hate, trying to polarize? Answer- We are against terrorists, not against Muslims nor are we against Dalits
 ham nafrat nahin failaana chaahate hai or naa hi jati-dharm ke aadhaar par raajnneeti karnaa chaahate hai
 We do not want to fight anyone
 desh se garibi dur karnaa hamaara lakshya he or waisi hi yojanaayen chalaa rahe hai
 Question- Rahul Gandhi has said that now the voice of Modi ji has become like a mouse? Answer- He who loses the election loses his restraint
 rahul or akhilesh kaa gathbandhan majaburi main hua he
 Mulayam himself did not want an alliance
 lekin jab akhilesh ko pataa chalaa ki wo haar rahe hai, tab unhone congress kii baisakhi kaa saath liya he, jisane bhi congress kii baisakhi kaa saath liya he, congress to dubi he, saathi ko bhi le dubi he
 Question- Mayawati has called Amit Shah the biggest terrorist? Answer- The public also saw Mayawati, she too did not remove poverty and loses control over language when someone loses elections

 aise main jo log piem ke liye aisi ochhi baaten kar rahe hai, unke bare main janata ke man jo bhi thodi bahut izzat he, usko bhi wo khatm kar rahe hai
 Question- Opponents are saying that what is the reason that the Prime Minister came to the crematorium and graveyard while talking about development? Answer- pm's point was misunderstood
 chunaav main bijli, chote-chote road, kabristaan sabaki baat honi chahie, piem ne iske bare main kaha tha
 He was not inclined towards any caste or sect
 lekin sapa, congress or basapa jaanboojh kar iskodharm or jati ke zehar main gholkarchunaav jeetna chaahate hai
 The politics of these opposing parties has always been divided on the basis of caste and religion
 sawaal- upi main bijepi kaa cheharaa nahin he, nuksaan hoga yaa nahin?jawaab- cheharaa nahin hone se kisi bhi tarah kaa koi nuksaan nahin hone ja rahaa he

 uttar pradesh ke kairana or nurpur upachunaav main ganna kisaanon kii naaraazgi kaa khamiyaja bijepi ko bhugatna padaa
 Whereas in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP was successful in feeding lotus in the whole 'sugarcane land'
 upachunaav main mili haar se sabak lete hue modi sarkaar ne ganna kisaanon ko khush karne kaa intjaam kiya he, taaki upi ke ganna land main uski badshahath 2019 main bhi barkaraar rahe
 The Modi government of the Center opened its eyes after stumbling in the Kairana by-election
 sarkaar ganna kisaanon ko badi raahat dete hue unka bakaayaa 20 hajaar karod ke bhugtan karne kaa elaan kiya he
 Also, the government has removed the export tax from sugar
 ganna kisaanon ke liye raahat kii kai ghoshnaaen karte hue kaha ki ganne kaa 30 lakh ton kaa bafer stock banaaya jayega
 All India Kisan Sangharsh Samiti said on the decision taken by the government that behind all this Kairana has its effect
 bharat kaa sabase badaganna utpaadak rajya uttar pradeshhai
 Sugarcane land covers the region from western UP to Purvanchal and central UP
 pashchim upi ko to ganna kaa katoraa kaha jaataa he
 There are about 40 Lok Sabha seats including Baghpat, Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Bijnor, Meerut, Moradabad, Ghaziabad, Amroha, Aligarh, Lakhimpur Kheri, Sitapur, Shahjahanpur, Barabanki, Hardoi, Faizabad, Gorakhpur, Kushinagar, Maharajganj, Deoria, Ballia and Mau
 Those who come under the ambit of sugarcane land
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or sahyogiyon ne upi kii 80 siton main se 73 par jeet hasil kii thi
 All the seats in sugarcane land were named after the BJP
 lekin kairana seat kii haar ne bijepi ko sochane ke liye majaboor kar diya he
 The motive behind the Modi government's kindness to sugarcane farmers is believed to be the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 kisaanon main naaraazgi bijepi se badhati ja rahi he or modi ke khilaaf vipaksh ekajute hai
 In such a situation, the Modi government has gone on a masterstroke to overcome the displeasure of sugarcane farmers and make a place in their hearts again
 iske jariye bijepi ko ummid he ki phir ek baar ganna land main uskaa jaadu barkaraar rahegaa
 In fact, the issue of sugarcane was raised very loudly during the Kairana by-election
 jiskaa samarthan kai vipakshi dalon ne bhi kiya tha
 According to him, about 20 thousand crores was not paid to the farmers of the country connected with sugarcane
 raajnneetik visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki kairana upachunaav main bijepi kii haar ke mukhya kaarnon main se ek ganna kisaanon ke paise kaa bhugtan na hona bhi tha
 Let us know that the plight of sugarcane farmers of UP is well known
 pradesh ke ganna kisaanon kaa 13 hajaar karod rupee chini milon par bakaayaa he
 While Yogi government's sugarcane minister Suresh Rana is an MLA from Thanabhavan assembly seat coming from Kairana Lok Sabha constituency
 baavjood iske ganna kisaanon ko bhugtan ke liye pareshaani uthaani pad rahi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had spoken about the payment of sugarcane farmers a day before the voting in the Kairana by-election in Baghpat, West UP
 iske alaava mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne shamali kii raily main 14 din ke andar kisaanon ke bhugtan kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 But the farmers' heart did not melt and BJP candidate Mriganka Singh had to face defeat
 is seat se areldi kii tabassum ko jeet mili
 This step of the Modi government for the payment of sugarcane farmers can bring political benefits not only in UP but also in Maharashtra
 upi ganne kaa sabase bada utpaadak rajya he, kyonki yah anumaanit 145
 Produces 39 million tonnes of sugarcane, which is 41% of all India production
 28 pratishat he
 After this Maharashtra 72
 26 million ton anumaanit utpaadan ke saath duusare sthaan par he, jo ki akhil bhartiya ganna utpaadan kaa 20
 52 percent
 congress or ensipi donon saath hai
 The BJP wants to repeat the previous election results with this move
 maharashtra ke baad number karnataka kaa aata he
 Karnataka 34
 48 million ton ganna utpaadan ke saath tisare sthaan par aata he, jo ki desh ke kul ganna utpaadan kaa lagbhag 11 pratishat he
 There was a big issue of debt waiver of farmers in the state
 congress or jedies gathbandhan karke satta par kabiz hai
 In such a situation, it can be helpful to beat this company
 tamilnadu ganne kaa chauthaa sabase bada utpaadak he, jo ki 26
 Produces an estimated production of 50 million tonnes of sugarcane, which is about 7 of the country's sugarcane production
 5 pratishat he
 Also Bihar 14
 68 million ton ganna ke utpaadan ke saath aata he
 4 of the country's sugarcane production
 17 pratishat he
 More than 70 whirlwinds in Central American neighborhoods killed at least 27 people, while the small town of Marisville was completely destroyed

 com / gr5b76exji Veeru Veeru in the stadium loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke chaar charan kii voting ke baad ab uttar pradesh kii kul 80 siton main se bachi 41 siten avadh or purvanchal ilaake kii hai
 The seats of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former BJP President Rajnath Singh, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and SP President Akhilesh Yadav are in this area
 aise main avadh-purvanchal kaa ilaaka siyaasi jang ke maidan main tabdeel ho chukaa he
 The responsibility of seats in these areas lies on the shoulders of Priyanka Gandhi in Congress
 aise main priyanka front-foot par khel rahi hai, jisase sapa-basapa, congress or bijepi ke bich varchasv kii jang tikhi ho chuki he
 Three phases of voting are yet to be held for the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh
 inamen kul 41 siten hai
 In 2014, two seats were won by Congress, one seat SP and BJP 39 seats
 ye siten purvanchal or avadh ilaake kii hai
 In the political struggle of this time, the SP-BSP alliance, Congress and BJP are all fighting the electoral battle with great force
 koi kisi se kam apane aapako dikhaanaa nahin chahta he
 Priyanka Gandhi, the Congress general secretary and in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, while talking to Aaj Tak had said, "in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has fielded candidates who will win or cut the bjp's vote
" ' isi din hi congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne barambaki main ek chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki basapa adhyaksh mayawati or sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ke remote control kii chaabi narendra modi ke paas he
 Narendra Modi can put pressure on the SP-BSP, but not on me
 modi se main nahin balki vah hamase darate hai
 The SP and BSP high command has been infuriated by rahul-priyanka's statement
 sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ne bayaan diya ki congress or bijepi main koi fark nahin he
 The Congress has no basis in public, so it is making such excuses
 congress ne apane ummidavaar ko utarkar bijepi ko phayda pahunchaa rahi he
 Akhilesh Yadav also denied Rahul Gandhi's allegations, saying, 'nobody controls us
 ham raajnneetik dal hai
 It is a coalition of the SP-BSP-RLD, which is challenging the ruling party in Uttar Pradesh
 duusari taraf mayawati ne bhi congress par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki bijepi kii tarah congress bhi anaap-shanaap bakne lagi he
 Congress and BJP are on the same plate
 ye donon ek duusare ko phayda pahunchane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 After the statement of akhilesh-mayawati, Aaj Tak said on Saturday that Priyanka Gandhi said, 'I am saying that i will give up life but will not help to benefit BJP
 main kabhi us vinaashak vichaardhaara ke saath samjhauta nahin kar sakati
 Never, not in whole life
 congress ne jo bhi ummidavaar utaare hai ve majbootee ke saath lard rahe hai jeetenge yaa phir bijepi kaa vot kaatenge, or kisi kaa nahin
 i am very clear about this
 avadh-purvanchal kii siyaasi ladaai main sapa-basapa gathbandhan, congress or bijepi ke bich kaante kaa muqabla he
 The Congress may not appear in the main contest in the four phases of elections in UP, but in the remaining phase one and a half dozen candidates of the party are fighting strongly
 inamen dhaurhara, barabanki, sitapur, raibareli, amethi, barabanki, baharich, banda, fatehpur, sultanpur, kushinagar, salempur, mirzapur, pratapgarh, bhadohi, sant kabir nagar, basti or maharajaganj jaisi loksabhaa siten shaamil hai
 That is why the SP-BSP has retaliated on Priyanka's statement
 akhilesh-mayawati is baat ko bakhubi samajhate hai ki agar congress ke khilaaf javaabi hamalaa nahin kiya to purvanchal kii siaayan ladaai kahin priyanka banaam narendra modi ke bich na simat jaae
 The way the Congress has already spoiled the alliance equation by bringing the leaders of the SP-BSP to the polls in many seats
 isiilie akhilesh-mayawati donon netaa priyanka or rahul ke bayaan se baichaiyn ho gaye hai
 However, the Congress candidates are also disturbing the bjp's equation
 15 agast ko ek kaarykram ke dauraan babulal gaur ne congress kaa jhanda thaamne ke maamle ne tool pakad liya he
 On Tuesday, Gaur may have clarified the matter, but BJP has considered it serious
 vahiin congress kaa kahana he ki isamen kuch galat nahin tha, jise lekar vivaad khadaa kiya ja rahaa he
 The case dates back to August 15, when former CM of the state Babulal Gaur was called in a program organized by Congress MLA Arif Akil in Bhopal
 gaur kaarykram ke mukhya atithi the
 Gaur was honored for participating in the freedom struggle
 lekin kaarykram ke dauraan hi kuch aisa ho gaya, jisaki kisi ne kalpana bhi nahin kii thi
 During the 'labor to Chief Minister BJP' program, Babulal Gaur held the Congress flag and waved it
 congress kaa jhanda thaamne ke maamle main babulal gaur ne mangalvaar ko safai di
 He said that he had gone to an event where he was honored
 uske baad unhen raily ko jhanda dikhaane ko kaha gaya, to unhone dikhaa diya
 It should not be taken to mean that he is leaving the BJP
 gaur ke mutabik wo jivan bhar isi party main rahenge kyonki party ne unhen majdoor se mukhyamantri banaakar farsh se arsh tak pahunchaaya he
 In such a situation, they cannot think of going anywhere else
 gaur par dore nahin daal rahi party: congresscabinet se chuttee hone ke baad se hi gaur apni hi sarkaar ke khilaaf kai masalon par bolte aae hai
 Now after the video of the Congress holding the flag, many speculations are being made in the politics of the state
 iske saath hi congress ne saaf kar diya he ki congress un par dore nahin daal rahi he, lekin gaur kii vichaardhaara ke saath jarur khadi he
 Gaur will have to answer: BJP Babulal Gaur's cleanliness has not had any effect on BJP
 bijepi capradesh upaadhyaksh rameshwar sharma ne kadaa rukh apanaate hue gaur se jawaab maanga he
 They have said that if the flag were tricolor, it would not matter
 congress kaa jhanda pakadaney par gaur ko jawaab dena hi hoga
 The game on the third day of the first Test of the five-match series between England and India was very volatile
 lunch se pehle tak england ke ballebaaj sam robasan (59) or gairi balance (71) ne team india ke gendbaajon kii naam main dam machaaya
 But after lunch, Team India's pace battery sent both of them to the pavilion and brought them back against the hosts
 bhubaneshwar kumaar ne 4 to ishanth sharma ne tisare din 3 wicket jatke
 England have scored 352 for 9 wickets by the end of the third day's play
 joe root 78 or james anderson 23 ran banaakar naabad laute
 See live score of the match
 
 
 utaar-chadhaav bharaa rahaa teesraa dinishanth ne 109 ran dekar teen wicket liye jabaki bhubaneshwar (61 ran dekar chaar wicket) ne apane kariyar main pehali baar chaar wicket hasil kiye
 But Root made half-century partnerships with tail-enders Stuart Broad (47) and Anderson to slightly improve England's position by the end of the third day's play
 din kaa pehla or teesraa seshan england ke naam rahaa tha to doosraa seshan puri tarah se bharat kaa rahaa
 Ishant's most 'dangerous' spell ever! In the morning session, the Indian bowlers did not get any wickets, but in the second session, Ishant's dreadful spell, India took England's six wickets for 74 runs
 kuch faisle haalanki vivaadaaspad bhi rahe
 Apart from Root, England-born Robson and Zimbabwe-born Balance scored half-centuries
 acchhee rahi england kii shuruyatengland ne subah ek wicket par 43 ran se aage khelnaa shuru kiya
 Both Robson and Balance disappointed the Indian bowlers in the morning session but after lunch Ishant changed the whole equation, taking three wickets for 29 runs in seven overs, England's score was 131 for one, four for 174
 Has run charhare badan ke is tej gendbaaj ne bejaan pich par reverse swing hasil karke england ke ballebaajon ko chakma diya
 After lunch, Ishant was shown the path of the pavilion to both Robson and Balance
 ye donon lunch ke samay 59-59 ran par khel rahe the
 Robson was unable to add to his score and Ishant lbw him out and sent him to the pavilion
 riple se haalanki lag rahaa tha ki gend ne balle kaa halkaa kinaaraa liya tha lekin australian ampire booras oxnford kii ungali uth chuki thi
 Robson played 142 balls in his innings and hit eight fours
 ian bel ne agali gend par chaukaa jadkar khaataa kholaa lekin isse ishanth par asar nahin padaa jo apane puure shabaab main the
 He lbw out the balance on a very beautiful ball and this time no one was in doubt
 balance kii pari 167 gend or 9 chaukon tak simit rahi
 The fall of the wickets had begun
 ishanth ne bharosemand bel (25) ko out karke england ko karaara jhatka diya
 Bell made a catch on the back of the wicket in an attempt to play a wrong shot on a rapidly rising short pitch ball
 moin ali (14) bhi short pich gend kaa shikaar bane lekin is baar gendbaaj shami thi
 The ball reached Shikhar Dhawan in a slip kissing the batsman's gloves
 bhubaneshwar ne iske baad mat praayar (5) or ben stokes (0) ko ek over main pavilion bhej diya
 Prior's fate, however, was not supported as the ball which umpire Kumar Dharmasena gave him was caught at the hands of Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 stokes ke maamle main haalanki aisa kuch nahin tha or gend unke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar dhoni ke dastaanon main samaayi thi
 Returning by the hosts after the T-break, England scored 205 for seven at the time of the T-break and were in danger of a follow-on but Broad came to the crease with aggressive temper
 unhone tisare seshan ke shuru se hi har gendbaaj par karaare prahaar karne shuru kiye or chaukon kii jhadi lagaakar jald hi team ko foloan se bachaa diya
 On the beautiful inswinger of Bhubaneswar, however, Broad was completely gutted and returned to the pavilion
 broad ne apni 42 gend kii pari main 9 chauke lagaae or root ke saath aathven wicket ke liye 78 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 Bhuvneshwar then bowled Liam Plunkett and made the best of his career
 bhubaneshwar or shami ne jis tarah se bhartiya pari main dasven wicket ke liye 111 ran kii saajhedaari kii usee tarah se anderson ne abhi tak root kaa acha saath diya he
 Both of these did not allow India's desire to cover England's innings on the third day
 root or anderson ne aakhri wicket ke liye ab tak 54 ran jod die hai bharat ko kal captain elistare cook ke rup main pehali safalataa dilaane vaale shami ne 98 ran dekar do wicket liye hai
 Dhoni also bowled to Ravindra Jadeja and Stuart Binny but did not get success
 apana pehla test match khel rahe binni ne keval chah over kiye

 imran kii party PTI aise samay main sabase badi party ke taur par ubhari he jab unki pratidwandvi partiyon or kai tippaneekaron kaa maananaa he ki purv cricketer ab sena ke laadle ban gaye hai or sena unki madad ke liye parde ke peeche rahakar kaam kar rahi he
 In such a situation, a big difference is being seen between Imran's 2012 statement and his attitude today
 saal 2012 main switzraland ke daavos shahar main vishwa aarthik manch (WEF) kii salanaa baithak ke dauraan news agency pitiai ko die ek intervyuu main imran ne kaha tha, ‘sena ke din lad gaye hai, aap pakistan main jald hi ek sachcha loktantr dekhenge
 After Imran's statement, when the elections were held in Pakistan, his party PTI was reduced to a few seats
 lekin buudhvaar hue chunaav ke baad saamne aa rahe nateezon main unki party shandaar pradarshan karti dikh rahi he
 Significantly, a big change has also come in Imran's opinion about the army
 is saal may main america akhbaar neuyork times ko die intervyuu main imran ne kaha tha, ‘yah pakistan kii sena he, dushman kii sena nahin he
 i will take the army with me
 ’ saal 1947 main pakistan kii aazaadee ke baad se ab tak lagbhag aadhe samay vahaan sena kaa hi shashan rahaa he
 The army is also interfering in the democratically elected civilian governments of Pakistan
 bharat par badal liya rukhbharat ko lekar bhi imran kii raay main ab badlaav najar aata he
 In 2012, Imran wanted a good relationship with India, but in this election he accused India of weakening the Pakistani army and conspiring to meet former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 maujuuda chunaavon main jeet darj karne ke baad imran ne kaha ki pakistan bharat ke saath rishte sudhaarney ke liye taiyaar he or agar bharat ek kadam aage badhayega to vah do kadam aage badhayenge
 Raising the issue of alleged human rights abuses in Kashmir, he said that Kashmiri people are suffering
 baatcheet ko bataaya tha rastasaal 2013 main daavos main ek baar phir agency ko die intervyuu main imran ne is baat par jor diya tha ki senaayen bharat or pakistan kii dwipaksheeya samasyaon kasmadhaan talash paane mensaksham nahin hai
 He regretted that the peace process was going backwards due to ceasefire violations
 us vakt imran ne kaha tha ki bharat or pakistan ko apane dam par lambit mudde sulajhane chahie or lagaataar baatcheet honi chahie
 Imran had said, 'enmity is not in the interest of the people of India and Pakistan
 
 
 aakhirkaar samaadhaan vaarta kii mej par hi hona he or matbhed sulajhane ke liye shantipurna vaarta kii jarurat he
 When asked if the forces of India and Pakistan should remain more in touch at the top, he said, "we need strong (political) leadership
" sena se masale hal nahin hone vaale
 Army people are not able to find political solutions
 ’america kaa tissue paper he pakimarana khan ne kaha tha, ‘aakhirkaar bade janadesh vaale netaa hi donon deshon ke bich mudde sulajhaa sakate hai
 At that time, Imran had said that America has been using Pakistan as 'tissue paper'
 aise main yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki america ko lekar unka ravaiya kaisaa rahata he
 During his 2012 visit to Davos, Imran attended ceremonies organized by Indian business chambers in which corporate and political leaders of India also attended
 imran ne yah bhi kaha tha ki apane raajnneetik safar main jamaat-ud-daawa jaise sanghathanon se baatcheet karne main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Former cricketer Imran had said, "there is nothing wrong if i bring them (extremists) back to the mainstream and if you talk about supporting the extremists, didn't the US support the Taliban?" When asked about the policy towards India on coming to power, Imran promised that swift steps would be taken to normalize relations and for confidence building measures
 apane haal ke bayaan main bhi unhone bharat ke saath rishte sudhaarney kii baat par jor diya he
