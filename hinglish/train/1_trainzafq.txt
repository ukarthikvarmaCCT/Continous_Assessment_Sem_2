lords ke aitihaasik maidan par mejabaan england pehali baar vishwa vijeta banane main safal jarur rahaa, magar kistam ke dam par
 Due to the 'strange rules' of the ICC, he got luck
 jisase isisi ke rules par sawaal uth khadey hue hai
 The match between England and New Zealand in the final match of the World Cup was 50–50 overs and the match was followed by a super over
 magar baad main jeet-haar kaa faisla match ke dauraan sabase zyada boundry lagane ke aadhaar par hua
 England outnumbered New Zealand on this scale
 aaie jaanate hai, kya he super over ko lekar banaaya gaya niyam, jiske chalate newjiland ko england ke haathon vishwa cap ganvaana padaa
 Let us know that New Zealand had scored 241 runs for eight wickets after winning the toss and batting first
 jawaab main khilne utari england kii puri team isi score (241 ran) par ol out ho gai or match taai ho gaya
 But ICC rules made England the world champion
 kyon hota he super oveedgar nirdhaarit 50-50 overs main match barabari par rahata he to match ke parinaam ke liye isisi ne super over kaa niyam bana rakhaa he
 a one-over super over is followed by a game of scheduled overs
 agar isamen bhi muqabla barabari par rahata he to phir vah team vijeta ghoshit hoti he, jisane apni pari ke dauraan sabase zyada boundry lagaai hoti he
 England had hit 22 fours and 2 sixes in the final match of the World Cup, while New Zealand had 2 sixes and 14 fours in their innings
 is prakaar england jeetne main safal rahaa
 This is when the super over formula is applied for the result of the rulematch, then the team who batting later during the match gets a chance to play first
 chah gend ke mukaable par jeet-haar tiki hoti he
 The team's innings is considered to be over only after two wickets fall
 jab super over se bhi donon tiimon ke ran baraabar hote hai to phir super over kaa doosraa mauka nahin miltaa
 After this, a team's win-loss decision is made on the basis of boundary
 army chif bipin ravat par bayaanbaji kaa daur jari he
 Sandeep Dixit, son of Congress leader and former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, has called the army chief a 'road ka goonda'
 dikshit ne kaha ki hamaare sena pramukh jab 'sadak ke gunde' kii tarah bolte hai, to kharaab lagata he
 After this statement of Dixit, BJP opened the front against him
 grih rajya mantri kiran rigiju ne twit kar kaha ki congress party ke saath ho kya rahaa he? congress army chif ko sadak kaa gunda kaise kah sakati he
 However, shortly after making the statement, Sandeep Dixit apologized for his statement

 He is wrong, so i apologize and retract my statement
 'congress netaa dikshit ne kaha, 'pakistan ek hi cheez kar saktaa he ki ek hi tarah kii ul julul harakatein kare or bayaanbaji kare
 The worst happens when our army chief also makes a statement like a street goon
 pakistan kaa de to de, unki fouj main kya rakhaa he
 They are all mafia type people, but why do our army chiefs make such statements
 'unhone kaha ki dekhie hamaare paas saumyata he, sabhyataa he, gaharaai he, takat he
 Our country is a role model in the countries of the world
 or ham bhi is tarah kii harakat karen, to ochhi lagati he

 Now what would you expect from the UP police in such a situation? You can only say that Yogi ji's police is really amazing
 ab koi bura naa maan jaae to lage haath ye bhi bataa duun ki upi police kii itani sari kabalidat kii pole-pattee koi or nahin balki khud upi police hi khol rahi he
 Actually, one of the officers of UP police felt that let's take a test of our team
 ab us test main kya-kya hota he ye dekhne laayak he
 Yogi ji was saying that he will make the police of Uttar Pradesh so that the police department of New York itself will come and ask how brothers are doing
 to ab upi police ke is sikret formule par se pardaa hatane vaala he
 Because we are now going to show you how the UP police does
 sabase pehle pashchimi upi ke bijanour zile ke nazibabad thane kii training kii jhalak dekhie
 Where Bijnor's CO Arun Kumar had said that long before coming, he was coming to inspect
 nirikshan kii shuruyaat upi ke in daroga ji se hui
 Daroga ji was given a palette gun and told to drive
 are ye kya ye miss ho gai
 CO Sabah shouted
 ek arse se sarkaar ne ye pallate gan thane ko di hui he
 The Divan Saheb of the police station also kept it safe
 par naa dewan sahab se matlab
 No means to inspector sir
 chal rahi he naukari
 Let it go
 thanedaar ne chalaai, lekin ye kya sahab phir kah rahe hai ki oh maai god
 
 phir miss ho gai
 But now how to fire next
 goli kahaan lagegi
 Please tell someone
 sahab thanedaar se bole, ab bandook neeche karo
 Change the bullet vahaan khadey hokar ye sab dekh rahe dewan sahab kii to jaise izzat par ban ai
 He snatched the gun from the Thanedar and started aiming himself
 magar ye kya dewan ne goli to chalaai lekin phuss ho gai
 Now the Inspecting Officer finally said, "let it be done
" chaliye ab duusari bandook tri karte hai
 No one will speak
 ek to sio sahab sir par khadey hai
 There is insult to other colleagues from above
 chaliye kam se kam inspector sahab ko ye to pataa hoga hi ki ye bandook chalati kaise he
 Sir asked - tell me how to run it
 or is bandook ko kehete kya hai
 Today Sardar ji is stuck in difficulty
 kyonki sio sahab ke kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab inspector sahab ke paas nahin he
 Sahab asked furiously, what do the first work do
 dewan sahab baar-baar inspector sahab kii madad karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But the Seo Sahab silenced him
 kareeb 15 se 20 minute ke test ke baad ye tay hua ki inspector sahab ko to naa bandook chalaanaa aata he auki naa hi uske bare main unhen kuch pataa he
 Sahab told his staff "write about all this
 
 
 shunya jaankaree he
 "well now the information of Inspector Sahab is zero
 lihaaza esao sahab ne nirikshan karne ke bajaae hathiyaaron kii jaankaree deni shuru kar di
 But even after explaining and telling SO sir, Inspector Saheb could not fire the gun
 kul milakar ek kambal par bichhe asalhe or barood ne upi police ke in javaanon ke zamir kii dhajjiyaan uda di
 The CO had to say in compulsion - if you do not practice, you will be dismissed
 aisa nahin he ki sio sahab thane main kisi khaas inspector kaa inspection karne aae ho
 Rather, his proper inspection was for the preparation of police stations and policemen
 lihaaza ab baari thi thane ke duusare police waalon ke saamaanya or practil gyaan kaa
 He asked the same inspector of the police station, what is the name of this person
 lijie sahab inspector sahab to bandook kaa naam tak nahin jaanate
 So how will they run it? haathon main tear gas chalaane vaali bandook lekar bhi inspector sahab ye nahin bataa paae ki use kehete kya hai
 CO sir again fell away and said - Leave it, you will not be able to do it
 ab baari thi thane ke duusare inspector kii
 In whose hands tear gas shells were given
 poocha gaya ki sahab ise chalaate kaise hai
 So see what the inspector said
 unhone kaha ki aansu gas chalaayenge or sahab let jaaenge
 CO sir fired the question- will you lie down after firing tear gas? Then CO sir started everyone's class
 hathiyaaron ke saamaanya gyaan main upi police ke javaanon kaa str kya he
 Except the two policemen of the police station, the other policemen could not open the pistol and other rifles and close them again
 or naa hi unhen hathiyaaron ke naam tak pataa the
 After inspecting the soldiers, the officer proceeded
 hathiyaaron kaa nirikshan kiya gaya to kya saamne aayaa
 It turned out that many guns and grenades are around four years old
 kaartoos kharaab ho chuke hai
 Tear gas shells were also cheated
 ab to sio arun kumaar buree tarah jhalla uthe or bole- ye saare expire ho chuke hai
 Actually, this visit was to inspect Arun Kumar, a CO of Bijnor who had reached Najibabad police station
 ab sochie bhala thane main agar kisi immergency se nipatane ke liye jawan hi taiyaar naa hon or unke hathiyaar bhi expyri date ke hon to bulandshahr or gajipur jaisi ghatnaayen agar huin to usamen hairaani kisi
 Perhaps the result of this half-completed preparation was the death of Inspector Subodh Kumar in Bulandshahr
 or gajipur main sipaahi suresh vatsa kii maut ho gai
 Overall, there is just such a problem in the police stations and jawans of UP police
 baaki sab thik he

 netaa pratipaksh koi ravaayati pad nahin he jo vakeelon kii tarah antaheen bahes karne ke liye srujit kiya gaya ho
 In parliamentary democracy, it is necessary for check and balance
 yah isliye bhi jaruri he taaki sansthaaon main paksh or vipaksh ke samanvay se nishpakshta, paardarshita or javabdehi bani rahe
 The absence of a Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha of the Indian Parliament is not an extraordinary thing
 1969 main pehali baar netaa pratipaksh pad par kisi netaa ko manyata di gai
 After this, the post remained vacant during the fifth (1971–77), seventh (1980–84) and eighth (1984–89) Lok Sabha
 haalanki, is bare main kanoonee paricharchaa 2014 main shuru hui jab spikar ne congress ko netaa pratipaksh kaa pad dene se inkaar kar diya
 In the 2014 elections, the Congress was the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha, with a total of 44 members
 loksabhaa kii kul siton kaa das fisadi yani 545 main kam se kam 55 sadsy na hone ke aadhaar par congress ko netaa pratipaksh ke liye adhikrut nahin kiya gaya
 This time in the seventeenth Lok Sabha, the Congress has announced that it has a total of 52 members who do not meet the 10 per cent condition, so it will not seek the post of Leader of Opposition
 yah behad mahatvapurn he ki agali loksabhaa ke gathan se pehle netaa pratipaksh ke paksh yaa vipaksh main kanoonee tark pesh kiye ja rahe hai
 How did the 10 per cent of the Leader of the Opposition come to power? In 2014, the Lok Sabha Speaker consulted the Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, the supreme legal officer of the Central Government, about giving the post of Leader of the Opposition to the Congress
 23 july, 2014 ko mukul rohtagi ne jo salaah di, usamen teen mukhya bindu the
 First, Rohatgi cited Lok Sabha Speaker's Directives 120 and 121 (1) (c) in 1956
 yah nirdesh kahata he ki agar koi party loksabhaa ke kul sadasyon kaa 10 fisadi sadsy hone kaa korum puraa nahin karti he to loksabhaa adhyaksh sabase bade vipakshi dal ke netaa ko netaa pratipaksh pad par manyata dene ke liye baadhya nahin he
 However, Directive 120 states that the Lok Sabha Speaker may recognize an association of members as a parliamentary party or group for the purpose of running the process of the House smoothly and the decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha will be final
 nirdesh 121(1)(c) kahata he ki sansadeey dal kii manyata dene ke liye kam se kam nirdhaarit korum puraa hona chahie jo ki sadan ke kul sadasyon kaa 10 fisadi hota he
 There is no mention of the Leader of Opposition in these directives, while it talks about recognizing the parliamentary party or group
 1956 ke in nirdeshon kaa uddeshy kya tha?nirdesh 122 main 7 uddeshyon kaa ullekh he: (a) sadan main siten or block kaa alotment (b) sansad bhawan main kamare alot karnaa (c) party meeting ke liye cameti room alot karnaa (d) aadhikarik dastavej kii aapurti karnaa (e) sansadeey samitiyon ke liye namakan karnaa (f) bahes ke liye spikar ko naamon kaa panel saunpna (g) sadan chalane ke liye salaah lenaa yaa sadan main saamne aae kisi bhi ahm bindu par charchaa karnaa
 Rohatgi's second argument was that the recognition of the Leader of the Opposition does not come under the purview of the 'salary and Alliances of Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977', whereas whatever the name for the Leader of Opposition is, 'salary and Allowances of Leaders of Leadership' The Opposition to Parliament Act, 1977 gives it constitutional recognition and was the first time the post of Leader of Opposition was legally interpreted
 kanoon kaa section 2 kahata he ki nichle sadan yani loksabhaa main vipaksh main jo sabase badi party hogi, spikar uske netaa ko netaa pratipaksh kii manyata degaa, lekin kam se kam 10 fisadi sadasyon ke hone kii shart kaa zikr kahin nahin he, jiske aadhaar par netaa pratipaksh chunaa jaae
 However, Rohatgi argues that even after the passing of the 1977 Bill, the post of Leader of Opposition in the seventh Lok Sabha remained vacant
 netaa pratipaksh ke liye 1956 main diya gaya spikar kaa nirdesh hi prabhavi rahaa
 PDT Acharya, general secretary of Lok Sabha from 2005 to 2010, has a different view
 ve kehete hai ki 'selleri and elounsej aaf leader aaf apojishan in parliament act, 1977' aane ke baad netaa pratipaksh ke pad ko sanvaidhanik darja mila or yah sthapit hua
 The Speaker's directive of 1956 became irrelevant after this bill was passed
 1985 (anti-defection Law) main 10veen anusuchee ke prabhaav main aane ke baad sadsy sankhya par dhyaan na dekar har vipakshi party ko mahatv diya jaataa he
 The 10th Schedule made the Speaker's Directive 120 irrelevant
 haalanki, 1984-1990 ke bich loksabhaa ke mahasachiv rahe subhash kashyap 1956 ke spikar ke nirdesh ko praathamikta dete hai
 They say that the Act of 1977 or any other law does not say that the Speaker's directive is illegal, but he also says that the Speaker should recognize the Leader of the Opposition, as it is a position of responsibility and for a healthy democracy It is important that there is also a permanent opposition against a strong government
 rohtagi kaa teesraa tark sivisi act, artiai act, lokapal or lokayukta act or human rhite act ke tahat banane vaali chayan samitiyon main netaa pratipaksh kii maujuudagi ke bare main tha
 He said that the CVC Act and the RTI Act provided for the leader of the largest party as an alternative to the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 in chaaron kanoonon main yah bhi praavdhaan he ki agar chayan samiti main koi pad khaali he to bhi iske dwaara kiya gaya chayan avaidhanik nahin hoga, isliye rohtagi ne netaa pratipaksh kii vaidhanik jarurat se inkaar kar diya
 What happens next? It doesn't matter who is winning the legal debate
 sansad main prabhavi vipaksh ke liye netaa pratipaksh kii apni mahatta he
 Apart from this, it is also important to have a leader of opposition to maintain fairness and transparency in the appointments of accountable entities like CVC, CBI, CIC, Lokpal
 na hi ise badha chadhaakar dekhnaa chahie or na hi ise kamatar dekhnaa chahie
 It does not matter how much laxity or ambiguity in the law, as Rohatgi introduced
 pediti acharya westminster model kaa hawala dete hai jiskaa bharat anusaran kar rahaa he
 In this, the opposition is its own independent power and the leader of the opposition is called the 'shadow of the Prime Minister' who is ready to take charge in the event of the government falling
 iske alaava sadan main nitiyaan banane or vidhaayi kaaryon main netaa pratipaksh kaa kaam vipaksh ko ekajute karnaa or prabhavi banaae rakhane kaa hota he
 They say that a law passed from Parliament now exists to recognize the Leader of Opposition, it should be implemented
 acharya dilli vidhansabha ke us anukaraniya udhaaharan kaa bhi zikr karte hai jab 2015 main bijepi ko 70 main sirf 3 siten milin
 Nevertheless, Speaker Ram Niwas Goyal gave the status of Leader of Opposition to BJP leader Vijender Gupta

 " Pollution is becoming a big problem in India, but it is completely missing from the Lok Sabha election issue
 uttar bharat ke tamaam ilaakon main paraali jalaane kii vajah se hawa main pradooshan khatarnaak str par pahunch jaataa he, lekin loksabhaa chunaav main na netaaon ke liye or na hi aam aadmi ke liye yah koi mudda nahin he
 It is not even being discussed during the election
 vahiin, paryaavarnavidon kaa kahana he ki aaj vaayu pradooshan or jal pradooshan ek badi samasya he, lekin aam logon main abhi tak iske prati jaagrukta us str tak nahin ai he, jisase yah chunavi mudda ban sake
 In Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh as well as Rajasthan when paddy straw is burnt, people in delhi-ncr also have trouble breathing
 diwali par to vaayu pradooshan khatarnaak str par chalaa jaataa he or tamaam log iske shikaar ho jate hai
 Over the years it has been observed that PM2
 5 or piem 10 jaise maheen kan hawa main saamaanya ke mukaable 10 guna tak bad jate hai
 Due to this the air of delhi-ncr becomes poisonous in the months of October, November and December
 jaade ke sijan main to is samasya ko lekar dilli jaise metropolitan shahar main sarkaar ko tamaam kadam uthaane padate hai
 If we talk about water pollution, then the condition of Yamuna river in Delhi has become like a dirty drain
 yamuna ke pani ke andar rahane vaale jeev-jantu mar chuke hai or pani puri tareeke se kshareey ho gaya he
 Talk about other areas of delhi-ncr, the situation of Hindon river in Ghaziabad has become worse in terms of pollution
 hapur ke paas kii kaali nadi ab naala ban chuki he
 Despite all this, the apathy towards these rivers is very worrying
 dilli nivasee kundan kumaar kaa kahana he ki jab nadi se logon kaa lenaa-dena hi nahin rahaa, to uske prati logon kaa pyaar kaise ho saktaa he? jane-maane paryaavaranvid or yamuna biodivarsity park ke scientist incharge fayaaj khudasar ke mutabik yah vaaki durbhagyapurna he ki is baar kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ne paryaavaran se jude muddon ko apane ghoshnaptr main pramukhataa se jagah nahin di
 He believes that a river filled with clean air and water should now be made an election issue, but this time it has not happened
 unka maananaa he ki vaayu or jal pradooshan ko lekar logon main or zyada jaagrukta kii jarurat he
 Environmentalists like us have failed to tell the importance of environment among common people
 jane-maane paryaavaranvid vilaas gokate ke mutabik aam logon main paryaavaran ko lekar chintaa to jarur he, lekin yah chunaav kaa mudda bane, iske liye abhi itani jaagrukta logon main nahin ai he
 He says that people are being affected by air pollution and the rivers are being completely destroyed
 isse hamaara astitv bhi khatre main pad gaya he
 In such a situation, political parties will have to think on this issue
 unako paryaavaran ke masale par apni ranneeti logon ke bich rakhni hogi
 This time it is not an election issue, but it will definitely become an election issue in the coming days

 According to the English newspaper 'indian Express', the CBI held meetings with Law Minister Ashwani Kumar and the Prime Minister's Office before giving a status report on the matter to the Supreme Court last month

 According to the newspaper, CBI Director Ranjit Sinha was also present in this meeting

 Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said on Twitter that this is a serious matter and there is evidence to pressurize the CBI to save the Prime Minister

 Jaitley said, UPA is a 'rogue' government, which will not allow the CBI to function independently
 tippaniyan When NDTV asked the CBI director about the report, he declined to comment
 piemo ne bhi yah kehete hue pratikriya dene se inkaar kar diya ki maamla nyaay kshetra main vichaaradhin he
 In this case, former CBI director Joginder Singh says that CBI is a ministry of the government and no government allows it to function impartially
 vahiin congress kaa kahana he ki bijepi kii aadat ho gai he desh ko gumraah karne kii
 According to the newspaper, in the meeting of senior CBI officials with the law minister, several amendments were suggested in this report and the CBI accepted them
 akhbaar ke anusaar is baithak main sibiai ke nideshak ranjit sinha bhi maujuud the
 The BJP has reacted sharply to this

 Nagla Phatela, a village in Uttar Pradesh, 150 km from Delhi, is a new gritty of the Modi government
 gaanvon main bijli pahunchane ko lekar ek saal puraane abhiyaan kii safalataa kaa zikr karte hue pradhanmantri ne laal kile se elaan kar diya ki is gaanv main sattar saal baad bijli pahunch chuki he
 It was not even seven hours after the speech that the government came to know that the claim is false, because the village is still dark
 iske baad twit waapas lene or uttar pradesh sarkaar se kiafiyat talab karne kaa daur shuru hua
 The challenge of extending the schemes to the beneficiary is a fundamental complication of Indian governance
 nagala fatela iskaa sabase nayaa numaayinda he
 This confusion with the Modi government has increased as nothing has been learned from the old experiences before creating new ambitious schemes
 duusari taraf prachaar itnaa tej hua ki nagala fatela kai jagah najar aane lage
 Our leader in making schemes is Lasani
 acchhee scimen pehle bhi baniin or is sarkaar ne bhi banaain
 The second floor of the schemes is for resource mobilization, coordination (from Central, State and Government departments) and setting targets
 labhaarthi tak pahunchane ke baad skim ko aakhri manzil milti he
 Many schemes of the government have not even crossed the second floor, while the medium term has been imposed
 nagala fatela ke sandarbh main teen pramukh skiimon kii padtaal kii ja sakati he, jo last mil chalange kii shikaar hai
 In November 2015, when the government paid 0 on service tax
 5 fisadi ses lagaaya, tab tak swatchta abhiyaan ko ek saal biit chukaa tha or skim ke lakshya, kriyanvayan kaa tarika va sansaadhan tay nahin ho paae the
 The mission of cleanliness raised hopes of complete sanitation in cities and villages, but within a year it was limited to building toilets in villages and eliminating open defecation on the lines of the Nirmal Gram of the UPA government
 nayaa tex lagane se sansaadhan milane lage, lekin abhiyaan main gati nahin ai
 Ultimately, cities have to be cleaned by municipal bodies which do not have the resources
 yadi sansaadhan nagar nigamon ko jane lagate to shaharon main safai kaa pahiyaa gum saktaa tha
 While constructing toilets in villages, it was not seen how the water supply and sewage disposal would be arranged
 in donon buniyadi jaruraton ke liye sansadhano kii vyavastha skim main shaamil nahin thi
 Therefore, toilets built in villages could not be used
 taaja suurate-haal yah he ki sarkari sankalp, skiimon, vibhaagon or nae tex ke baavjood shahar va gaanv jas ke tas gande hai
 Another example is the direct benefit transfer (direct subsidy to beneficiaries) scheme
 skim ke paas sansadhano kii chunauti nahin thi kyonki sabsidi pehle se banti ja rahi thi
 However, after the success of distributing LPG subsidy, the scheme came to a halt
 darasal, alpiji sabsidi universal thi yani sabko milani thi
 Like kerosene or other subsidy schemes, it did not have the challenge of identifying the beneficiaries
 alpiji ke baad debiti kaa safar dhimaa pad gaya
 DBT schemes of kerosene and food subsidy could not be activated
 sabsidi vaali skiimon ko alag-alag mantralay chalaate hai
 The role of state governments is also important in this
 yah samgr samanvay hi debiti kii duusari manzil he
 This work was done easily in LPG as the Petroleum Ministry, oil companies and a few hundred gas agencies had to implement this scheme
 anya skiimon ke maamle main yah itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Identification of beneficiaries is the last floor of this scheme, the scale of which is not yet decided
 manaregaa ko debiti se jodgaye kii koshishen tej nahin ho sakin kyonki rajyon va centre ke bich talmail nahin ban paaya
 The government has resources for DBT
 safaltaaon kaa tajurba bhi he, lekin samanvay or kriyanvayan kii chunautiyon ke kaaran manzil nahin mil saki he
 The Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana could have been the most revolutionary initiative of rural development in India because for the first time a government had connected the elected supreme representative to the lowest unit of democracy i
e
 the Panchayat
 saansad nidhi se jode jane par yah skim chamatkaarik ho sakati thi
 But the goals of the plan were unclear
 gaanvon main centre va rajya kii darjanon scimen chalati hai jinase samanvay nahin hua isliye sarkari vibhaag to dur, saansadon ne bhi gaanvon ko apnaane main koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai or ek badi pahal bich main hi dam tod gai
 Before the fresh reshuffle in the cabinet, the Prime Minister said that for me, success means that people feel the change
 yadi uplabdhiyon kaa daawa karnaa pade to main ise safalataa nahin maanoonga
 However, the Prime Minister had to make claims on his own in the marathon speech of the Red Fort
 swadhinata diwas par pradhanmantri kaa bhaashan unki bechaini bataa rahaa tha ki sarkaar aadha rasta paar kar chuki he, lekin skiimon ke asar najar nahin aa rahe hai
 It is good that the Prime Minister is restless, not reality like Congress
 rajanetaaon kii bechaini acchhee hoti he khaastaur par tab jabaki sarkaar ko hakeekat kaa andaja ho
 The Modi government, which is completing two and a half years, should now fight the implementation challenge, which is derailing its good intentions
 sarkaar ko skiimon kii bheed se nikal kar chuninda kaaryakramon ko chunanaa hoga or unhen nateezon tak pahunchaana hoga taaki badlaav mahasoos ho sake
 The Prime Minister has no shortage of experience like Nagla Fatela
 apekshaaon ke khel kaa jokhim bhi ab tak unhen samaj aa gaya hoga
 His competition is now with time, he has no control over the speed of his passing
 Galaxy Note 8 launch ho saktaa he
 You will know what happened to the Galaxy Note 7
 lekin ab samsung ke mobile chif deje ko ne elaan kiya he ki company is saal ke mid main flagship smartphone launch karegi
 From the statement issued by the company, it is clear that the company does not want to stop after the Note 7 flop, but is preparing to launch it as before
 Note 7 kii bydaree lagaataar fatne ke baad company ne iskaproduction or bikri hameshaa ke liye khatmkar diya gaya
 Apart from this, reports also came that maybe the company can finish this series
 lekin aisa nahin he
 However, the company has not mentioned the name of Galaxy Note 8 in its press release
 lekin samsung ne haal hi main apane flagship smartfones Galaxy S7 or S7+ launch kiya he
 So what does a new flagship mean in the mid of this year
 reports ke mutabik nae flagashipasmartphone ko 2017 ke mid main launch kiya jayega
 It is worth noting that the company launches note series phablets at this time
 yani company ke statement se yah saaf hota he ki company shaayad Note 8 laane kii taiyaari main he
 Because the Note 5 launched in August 2015, while the Note 7 was also launched in August last year
 haal hi main launch hue Galaxy S7 or S7+ ko duniya bhar main acha rispons mil rahaa he
 Its pre booking is also getting quite a lot and these smartphones are strong in almost all departments
 pichley maheene samsung ne yah saaf kiya tha ki company puraane Note 7 kii bydaree badalakar iskaa Refurbished vairient bechegi
 According to reports, its sales will start in South Korea from June
 philhal keemton kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya he
 Meanwhile, Dr
 Zakir Naik's office in Dongri, Mumbai remained closed on Thursday
 lekin khud doctor nik ne saudi se apane upar lag rahe aaropon kaa khandan karte hue kuch video clip bheji hai
 In which they are putting the Indian media in the dock
 video main wo kehete sunai pad rahe hai ki unpar lag rahe sab aarope bebuniyaad hai, ye kahana ki meri vajah se aatank fail rahaa he ye media kii shaitani he

 Due to the stomach becoming heavier, the bowel starts to tilt

 Eminent cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle's tweets on Indian cricket team and Mahendra Singh Dhoni captaining the Pune team in the IPL have sparked a new debate
 twitor par harsha ke twits kaafii pratikriya bator rahe hai
 Harsha tweeted after Pune's innings that due to Dhoni's quick innings, Pune team finally has a fighting score, but they believe that they should have come up in the batting order
 Looks like a close match # rpsvkkr Dhoni's late charge has given # RPS something to play with
 Wonder if he should have come earlier though — Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) April 24, 2016 After this, the debate started on Harsha's tweet
 kisi ne ye tak likhaa ki ye twit dhoni se negative pratikriya lene ke liye likhaa gaya he
 After the defeat of Pune against RCB, a tweet from Harsha came in the news and the news of Dhoni and Harsha's relationship started to sour

 The condition of the national capital Delhi is suffering due to heavy rains on Wednesday morning
 sadaken talab ban gai hai
 This is why Kerry was stunned by the crowds when he arrived to address the students of iit-delhi in the morning
 unhen aashcharya hua ki aise mausam main itani badi sankhya main chaatr kaise unase milane pahunch gaye
 Lage hand he also commented - Have you come here by boat? 
 
 yakeenan soshal media se lekar tamaam jagahon parakeri kii is tippaneeko ek majaak ke taur par liya gaya
 However, it is very possible that he had said so before the beginning of his speech to make the atmosphere happy
 baharhaal, moumas kii maar ke baad bhale hi dilliwaalon ko naav kii jarurat nahin padi ho, lekin jon kerri ke liye yah ek jaankaree hi hogi ki duniya ke kai behtareen shaharon ko barish ne is kadar badahaal kiya ki vahaan vaaki sadakon par naav chalane lagi
 Due to heavy rains in Delhi, the boat has not been able to operate yet, due to this, the boat has floated on the road due to rain in Louisiana, London and Paris of UK
 isi maheene louiciana membarish ke badakareeb 20,000 logon ko boat ke jariye jalairao vaale ilaakon se baahar nikaala gaya
 The city of Louisiana was jammed for 24 hours due to rain
 dilachasp baat yah bhi he ki jon kerri apni taaja dilli yatra ke dauraan do baar trephic jam kaa shikaar ho chuke hai
 It is very likely that this is the reason why he made such a statement in the IIT in view of the situation

" jab ham apni film shoot kar rahe the, us samay agar vah market main aa jaatin to ek muslim ladki jafar khan kii bahu kaa role tha jo naazaneen patni ne kiya tha
 At that time we were looking for a Muslim girl and Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi are Muslims

 The Supreme Court has given its verdict on the Cauvery water dispute
 ise dekhte hue karnataka or tamilnadu main pehle hi suraksha vyavastha kadi kar di gai thi
 The Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal gave its final order on 5 February on this issue, which was challenged in the Supreme Court by both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states
 kaveri ko dakshin bharat kii ganga bhi kaha jaataa he
 It originates from the Brahmagiri mountain in the Western Ghats
 isaki lambaai kareeb 800 kilometre he
 There is good cultivation on the delta of the Kaveri River
 iske pani ko lekar donon rajyon main vivaad he
 The Supreme Court reserved its decision on 20 September last year after a long hearing
 yah karnataka or tamilnadu main is nadi ke jal par nirbhar lakhon pariwaron ke liye kaaphi bhaavnaatmak masalaa he
 Let us know in 10 points what is this dispute
 
 
 1
 Disputes and use of Cauvery river water have been in dispute between the people of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for 137 years
 sabase pehle 1881 main is baar main takaraar saamne ai, jab tatkaaleen mysore rajya ne kaveri par ek baandh banane kaa nirnay liya
 The then Madras State objected to this
 british logon kii madhyasthata ke baad kaaphi saal baad 1924 main jaakar is par ek samjhauta ho paaya
 But the dispute continued before independence and even after independence
 2
 The Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) was established in the year 1990
 saal 2007 main tribunel ne is par apana aadesh diya
 But only after the order of the Supreme Court, in 2013, the Central Government issued a notification related to this order
 3
 Crores of people of four states depend on the water of Cauvery river
 tribunel ne apane aadesh main tamilnadu ko 419 timasi foot, karnataka ko 270 timasi foot, kerala ko 30 tiemasi foot (kaveri kii ek sahaayak nadi rajya se guzarati he) or pudducheri ko 7 tiemasi foot jal kaa aavanton kiya tha
 4
 kaveri tribunel ne nadi main 100 saal kii ausat jal uplabdhta ke aadhaar par yah andaja lagaaya ki iskaa aadha jal hi istemaal ke liye uplabdh ho to bhi 740 foot tiemasi jal mil saktaa he
 The tribunal ordered Karnataka to release 192 TMC feet of water every year from June to May
 5
 The tribunal said that in a year of poor monsoon, all states will have to share the same water shortage
 lekin is praavdhaan ne karnataka or tamilnadu ke bich vivaad or badha diya
 6
 pichley kuch varshon main aniyamit monsoon or bengalooru main baari jal sankat kii vajah se karnataka baar-baar yah kahata rahaa he ki uske paas kaveri nadi basin main itnaa pani nahin he ki vah tamilnadu ko uskaa hissaa de sake
 7
 duusari taraf, tamilnadu bhi kaveri tribunel ke aadesh se khush nahin tha
 In August 2016, Tamil Nadu moved the Supreme Court, claiming that the tribunal's order was wrong, as it had only taken care of the harvest season
 8
 Tamil Nadu argues that farmers in the state sow two crops a year, so they should get more water than Karnataka
 tamilnadu kaa yah bhi tark he ki unhen tribnul ke aavanton se zyada pani kii jarurat he, kyonki rajya main sambha dhan kii kheti hoti he, jisamen zyada pani kii jarurat hoti he
 9
 tamilnadu sarkaar ke is kadam ke baad karnataka bhi tatkaal supreme court main chalaa gaya or usne rajya ke liye atirikt pani kii maang kii
 Karnataka said that it is not possible for him to release more water than tribunal has allocated for Tamil Nadu due to monsoon fluctuations and low rainfall
 10
 In September 2016, the Supreme Court ordered Karnataka to provide 15,000 cusecs of river Tumakilnadu Kocaveri every day for the next 10 days
 supreme court ke is aadesh ke baad puure karnataka main bade paimaane par hinsak pradarshan shuru ho gaye

 In this action being taken on the directions of the Supreme Court, due to the grain scam in the state due to the alliance between the leader-officer-mafia, the curtain has been lifted
 is ghotaale main congress ke netaa dalajit singh, sapa sarkaar main rajyamantri pandit singh, sapa ke purv vidhayak om prakaash gupta samet kai netaa aaropee banaae ja chuke hai
 In the SP government, the fragrance of the grain scam is once again heard
 netaaon, afasaron or mafia kaa gathjod garibon kaa anaaj hadapney main jute gaya he
 During the last one year, there have been complaints of disturbances in PDS in almost every district of the state
 peedies main gadbaditon ke khilaaf lard rahe gorakhpur ke saamaajik kaaryakarta sanjeev mishra bataate hai, ''gorakhpur main anaaj mafia or afasaron kaa gathjod niyamit aavanton vaala hajaaron metric ton apiel gehun hadap chukaa he
 On complaining, these officers are cleverly trying to avoid showing the distribution of extra wheat from the center every month instead of regular
 ''nishane par apiel gehundas saal pehle soobe main hue anaaj ghotaale main bhi sabase zyada apiel gehun kii hi chori hui thi
 This time too is something similar
 asal main apiel rashan cardon par vitaran ke aavantit hone vaale gehun ke liye koi spasht niti nahin he
 The grain mafia takes advantage of this and there is loot of grain at every step
 khaadya va rasad vibhaag se sevanivrutt hue adhikari es
 K
 verma bataate hai, ''shahar main apiel card dharak sabase kam rashan kii dukaanon par jate hai jabaki antyoday ke laal rashan card or garibi rekha se neeche (bipiel) waalon ke liye bane safed rashan card par khadyann kii maang shahar or gaanv main ek samaan hoti he
 Hence the scam is done by selling APL grains in the city through PDS
 '' khaadya evam rasad vibhaag ke ek maanak ke anusaar, ek apiel rashan card par 10 kilo se adhik anaaj nahin diya jayega
 Now look at the incident in Gorakhpur
 yahaan april, 2013 main 2,393 metric ton gehun shahari kshetra ke kul 1,60,969 apiel card dharakon ko baant diya gaya
 If it is assumed that every APL card holder living in the urban area of gorakhpur has come to the government quota shop to get ration, then 14 kg of wheat will be distributed on a card which itself is a violation of the standard
 sanjeev mishra bataate hai, ''gorakhpur shahar main rahane vaale 60 fisadi se zyada apiel rashan card dharak gehun lene sarkari galle kii dukaan par jate hi nahin hai
 If 40 percent of the card holders were given wheat at 10 kg, then where did the rest of the grain go? There are other ways to steal grain
 peedies khadyann kii boriyaan ab ek quintal kii na hokar 50 kilo kii hoti hai
 In the last week of September, the sacks of food grains given to the Kotdars from the block godowns of Amethi contained only 35 kg
 esadm is maamle kii jaanch kar rahe hai
 The assessment of the ability to store grain sacks in the game warehouse through sacks is a testament to the mess
 gorakhpur ko hi lijie
 According to the report of the Department of Food and Logistics, there are two warehouses in the name of Deepak Kakkar and Neelam Kakkar in Gorakhpur city
 donon kii kul kshamta prati maah ek-ek quintal vaale 32,666 bore rakhane kii he
 Adding the quantity of regular and additional allocated grains and sugar under the Antyodaya, BPL, APL, MDM scheme every month, a total of 44,722 quintals of grain reaches Gorakhpur city for distribution under PDS
 chunki ab anaaj 50-50 kilo kii boriyaan main aata he isliye gorakhpur nagar ke godaamon main 32,666 kii doguni yani 65,332 bori rakhane kii kshamta he, jabaki aavantit kul 44,722 quintal anaaj 89,444 boriyon main aayega
 Thus, where and how more than 2400 sacks are being kept every month? Sports are also being done through grain sacks
 khaadya evam rasad vibhaag ko anaaj rakhane ke liye kolkata se boron kii supplai hoti he
 These include the name of the company, the year and the UP government
 bareli main kareeb dhai hajaar boron par koi mark nahin tha or inhen ke jariye anaaj ko rice milon ko bechney kii baat bhi pichley saamne ai thi
 The Food and Logistics Department is monitoring through a collapsed system to stop such a game of rigging
 block str par tainaat hone vaale marketing inspector ke 1,133 pad hai jinamein 40 pratishat se zyada khaali pade hue hai
 On top of this, there are 468 posts of Area Marketing Officers in the Tehsil, out of which only 300 are filled
 yahi halaat supplai inspector or jila purti adhikariyon ke bhi hai
 Actually the food and logistics department of UP is unique in the country in that different branches of food and distribution are working here within the same department

 The JDU has started pressuring the BJP to announce its prime ministerial candidate for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections

 vaise bijepi ke nirnay main aresas kii bhi bhoomika ahm maani ja rahi he
 However, a political tussle continues on this issue
 jamaanat par shoharat
 
 
 This is not a jumla
 balki kadavi hakeekat he
 Since the year 1998, ie in the last 17 years, the amount of money and money Salman has earned is due to bail
 darasal jodhpur main unke khilaaf chaar mukademe chal rahe hai
 In all these cases, like Hit and Run case, he has got Bell

 And when the session court confirmed his sentence, Salman had to remain in jail from August 26, 2007 to August 31, 2007
 17 saal se kahaan gaayab he ahm gavaah?haris dulani hi wo shaks he jo rajasthan main salmaan khan ke khilaaf chal rahe chaaron maamalon main sabase mabattavapurn gavaah he
 Harish Dulani was running Salman's gypsy at the time of hunting i
e
 he is also an eyewitness of all the hunting cases
 lekin hairaani kii baat ye he ki haris dulani pichley 17 saal se gaayab he
 According to people, Harish Dulani is in Mumbai and some people believe that he has fled abroad
 lekin ajtak koi bhi shaks haris dulani kii gumshudagi ke raaj se pardaa nahin uthaa paaya he
 17 years ago, what happened once Harish Dulani disappeared from Jodhpur, he never returned to Jodhpur again
 itnaa hi nahin uske gharavaalon ko bhi nahin pataa he ki wo is vakt kahaan par he
 Actually, Harish Dulani testified against Salman Khan in the year 1998
 lekin ek maheene baad wo apane bayaan se palat gaya tha
 After that he disappeared such that till date he has not been detected

 There was an important meeting at 30 o'clock
 makasad tha ioe ke samvidhan main sanshodhano par charchaa karnaa
 Among those who participated in it were Lalit Bhanot, former secretary of the Athletic Association among the members of various national sports associations, besides Kalmadi and Verma, accused in the Commonwealth Games scam
 is baithak ke dauraan ghante bhar main tay ho gaya ki is saal ke aakhir main jab ioe kaa phir se gathan hoga to usamen bhanot ke saath abhaya chautaala (mukkebaaji), narinder batra (hockey) or virendra nanaavati (tairaaki) sareekhe khel sanghon ke mukhiyaaon ko unke sanghon ke asana par jamaaye rakhane kaa puraa intjaam hoga
 The details of the meeting prepared by the Sports Ministry were corrected by LB and NB
 ’’ elbi kaa matlab lalit bhanot or enbi kaa matlab narinder batra
 The Indian Olympic Association was suspended by the International Olympic Committee on 4 December 2012
 iskaa nateeja yah hua he ki sabhi bhartiya athleton ko antarrashtriya aayojanon main iosi ke binar tale hi muqabla karnaa pad rahaa he
 The IOC had sent a letter to IOA stating three reasons for its suspension
 ek to swaittata kaa abhaav, duusare olympic charter ke anusaar chunaav na karaayaa janaa or tisare naitikta or sushasan ke buniyadi siddhanton kaa paalan na kiya janaa
 This meant that the IOA would have to make a new constitution according to the Olympic Charter in all respects, especially regarding the age and tenure of the office bearers
 lekin iosi ko manjuuri ke liye bheje gaye ioe ke nae samvidhan ke masaude ko dekhakar kaha ja saktaa he ki agar yah manjuur ho gaya to yah charter kii buniyadi baton kii dhajjiyaan udaane vaala sabit hoga
 In particular, let's look at two important overlooks: 1
 ek sadsy ko lagaataar 20 varshon tak kaaryakari pad par bane rahane kaa adhikaar hoga; aath saal koshadhyaksh yaa mahasachiv ke rup main or 12 saal adhyaksh ke rup main
 After this, after a gap of four years, till the age of 70 years, he can remain in the Sangh again for 12 years
 (iske ulat olympic charter ke niyam 20
 According to 1, the term of a president is only eight years
 ise chaar saal ke liye phir se badhaayaa ja saktaa he, lekin uske baad nahin
 )2
 70 saal kii umr seemaa keval teen kaaryakari padon ke liye hi lagu hoti he, na ki sabhi sadasyon par
 This ensures that the powerful administrator will continue to use his influence in elections even after retiring
 (duusari ore, olympic charter ke niyam 16
 3
 3 ke mutabik, ‘‘iosi kaa koi bhi sadsy us calendar varsh ke ant tak hi sadsy rah saktaa he, jisamen uski umr 70 saal kii ho jaati ho
 '') These provisions make a strong provision that an administrator can rule the IOA or any National Sports Association unbridled till the age of 70 years
 isse bhi badtar yah ki ye praavdhaan 81 varshiya malhotra jaise kisi prashaasak ko is baat kaa bhi adhikaar dete hai ki vah apni jagah kisi kathputli ko mukhiya ke pad par bithakar khud upaadhyaksh, sanyukt sachiv yaa saadhaaran sadsy ke rup main apni ‘sevaayen’ detaa rah saktaa he
 Not only this, the IOA officials had prepared to ignore the Olympic Charter even more: they had considered giving the retiring president the right to retain the honorary president of the sports association even during his four-year sabbatical
 
 lekin aakhir main ise hataa diya gaya kyonki unhen shaayad andeshaa tha ki iosi ke padaadhikari turant iske peeche kii manshaa ko bhaanp lenge
 IOA Joint Secretary Rakesh Gupta was contacted when he defended these provisions
 unhone iske liye aisi-aisi daleelein deen, jiskaa jawaab nahin
 Listen in his own words: "there is not much of good people working selflessly in the field of administration in Indian sports
 olympic charter ke anusaar padaadhikariyon ke kaarykaal par 12 saal kii jo shart he, yah hamaare desh ke liye vyaavhaarik nahin he
 If a person becomes president at the age of 40, then according to the rules of the charter, he can remain the chairman till he is only 52 years old
 agar vah prashaasak aage bhi kaam kar saktaa he to us par is tarah kii pabandi kyon lagaai jaani chahie?’’gupta mahashay ke mutabik, jahaan tak ioe kii baat he to rashtramandal khel ghotaale ke sabhi aaropee chunaav ladgaye ke kaabil hai kyonki adaalat ne unhen abhi tak doshi to qaraar diya nahin he
 They question that "if the cabinet ministers can continue in their posts despite the allegations, then why can't the IOA officials be good?" The rule of law must remain
 ye log jab tak doshi sabit nahin ho jate, tab tak unhen nirdosh mana janaa chahie
 Mr

 We are trying to persuade IOA on these issues
 ’’khel mantralay uhapoh main funs gaya he
 On the one hand, the IOA is required to follow some of its specific guidelines under its National Sports Code, on the other hand, the IOC will consider this Code to be an intervention of the government until IOA itself incorporates these guidelines in its own constitution
 
 lekin ioe ke record ko dekhte hue mantralay ko un padaadhikariyon ke aage jhukne kii bajaae majbootee se kadam uthaanaa chahie, jo apana dabadabaa banaae rakhane ke liye ji-jaan se koshish kar rahe hai

 Meanwhile, the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) connection of the Nobel laureate is also in the limelight as he went to Tihar while studying in this university
 darasal, us vakt jeenyu ke president enaar mohanti ko campus se nishkasit kar diya gaya tha, jiskaa nobel vijeta abhijit banerjee sahit kai students ne purajor virodh kiya tha
 aajtak
 in ne enaar mohanti se khaas baatcheet kii or janaa puraa maamla kya tha
 Why was JNU Administration not happy? JNU is considered a stronghold of the Khanty Left, but there was a major reshuffle in the 1982-83 student union election as the frozen Left (AISA) suffered defeat here
 isse jeenyu administration bhi khush nahin tha
 At that time, a student leader was formed from the bar of the left organizations
 tab lekhak enaar mohanti chaatrasangh adhyaksh pad par jite the
 His organization broke the myth of the leftists established in JNU
 us dauraan abhijit banerjee ne mohanti kaa khulkar saport kiya tha
 In the same year, there was such a storm of protest in JNU, in which Abhijeet Banerjee also had to go to jail
 us vakt jeenyu main yogendra yadav, sindhu jha, sunil gupta or sipiai netaa kanhaiya kumaar ke guru esen malakar chaatr raajnneeti main kaaphi sakriy the
 What was the reason for the revolt in JNU? Writer NR Mohanty said that the JNU administration had expelled a student from the hostel
 isko lekar students main kaaphi naaraazgi thi
 i was then President of Student Union
 is maamle ko lekar ham vaais chancelar se milane gaye the, jab student ko hostel se nikaale jane kii vajah ke bare main poocha gaya to visi kaa jawaab tha ki usne misbihev kiya he
 At the same time, there was a demand of the students that any action should be taken only after investigation
 enaar mohantymohanti ne bataaya ki isse pehle hostel se nikaale gaye student ne ek teacher kii complaint kar di thi
 After this complaint, the students also started demanding to expel the teacher
 chunki administration hamaare sanghathan se khush nahin tha, isi liye wo jaanch ke liye taiyaar nahin hua or ham log bhi apni maang par ade rahe
 Meanwhile , a double lock was made by the administration in the hostel room of the students , after which the whole matter was spoiled
 kareeb 700 students kii hui thi giraftaarmohanti ne bataaya ki hostel room lock kiye jane ke baad ham logon ne virodh shuru kiya tha or lock todakar us student kii room main entry kara di thi
 After this, there was a complete ruckus
 jeenyu administration ne mujhe, union secretary or us student ko campus se nishkasit kar diya tha
 It was only after this action that the students surrounded the entire JNU and the Vice Chancellor
 yah maamla us vakt itnaa garma gaya tha ki police ko dakhal dena padaa
 After this, the police arrested us
 kareeb 700 students jail gaye the, jisamen kareeb 250 ladkiyaan thi
 Mohanty told that Abhijeet Banerjee was my junior, but he was in our support from the beginning
 is virodh ke liye unhen bhi mere saath tihaad jail main rahanaa padaa tha
 Abhijeet Banerjee, who was not in any union, NR Mohanty said that Abhijeet Banerjee was not in any union, but he openly supported me when i fought in JNU election as the President's candidate
 unhone bataaya ki hamane jeenyu campus main chota sa organijeshan banaaya tha
 His name was Students for Democratic Socialism
 isi sanghathan ke boote main jeenyu kaa president bana tha
 Mohanty said that even though Abhijeet was not associated with the organization, we used to have a view on the ideas
 mohanti ne bataaya ki pichley saal main america gaya tha
 i thought i would meet Abhijeet in Boston, but he went to Paris in summer vacation
 unki wif astor duflo french mul kii hai or chhuttiyon main wo sasuraal gaye hue the
 However, Abhijeet has said to meet on arrival in India
 kanhaiya prakaran ke baad kiya tha tihaad kaa zikrapichley kuch samay se jeenyu bhaajapa samarthakon ke nishane par he
 In February, after the Kanhaiya episode, an article was written by Nobel laureate Abhijeet Banerjee in a newspaper
 usamen unhone kaha tha ki hamen jeenyu jaise sochane-vichaarne vaali jagah kii jarurat he or sarkaar ko nishchit taur par isse dur rahanaa chahie
 In the same article, he also mentioned about the 1983 Tihar Jail being cut for 10 days
 unhone likhaa tha ki 1983 ham jeenyu ke chaatro ne visi kaa gheraav kiya tha
 The VC expelled the President of our Student Union at that time
 is bich police aakar saikadon chaatro ko uthaakar le gai, hamaari pitayee bhi hui thi
 But then there was no trial like treason

 He is sixth in the points table with 7 points
 agle round main pahunchane ke liye bangladesh ko apane donon match jeetne hi honge
 At the same time, one has to expect England to lose
 aise main bangladesh ke 11 ank honge
 New Zealand would like India to win in the Final-4, Team India and New Zealand have to win one match each
 bharat ke teen match hai, jisamen vah england, bangladesh or srilanka se bhidega
 At the same time, after the defeat of Australia, New Zealand will now have to beat England and secure their place
 aise main ravivaar ko newjiland ke phans bhi team india kii jeet dua karenge
 If this equation is formed
 
 
 team india agar england ko haraa de or pakistan donon match jeet le to aise main donon padosi desh semifinal main pahunch sakate hai
 In this situation Sri Lanka need to lose at least two matches
 vahiin, agar england donon match haar jaae to uske 8 ank hi rahenge
 On the other hand, if Pakistan and Bangladesh both win 1–1 matches, then they will get 9–9 points
 aise main behatar ranret ke aadhaar par bangladesh aage hoga
 If England, Pakistan and Bangladesh all win their 1–1 match then England will reach the final 4 as it will get 10 points

 Police said she would identify and arrest the attackers
 madhya pradesh ke shivpuri main dian hone or jaadu-tona karne kii aaropee ek adivasee mahila se teen din tak chah logon dwaara kathith rup se gangrape kiya gaya

 When does the government feel? When crises, illness, epidemics, disaster, or accidents occur
 sarkaar ek amoort ikai he, isliye gavarnence ke zyaadaatar anubhav vyaktigat hote he
 Disasters often create concrete and collective experiences about the activation of governance and the sensitivity of politics
 afsos ki sankramak mausami rogon se juujhati dilli ko hamdard sarkaar kaa anubhav karaane ke pehle maukey par aam aadmi party (aap) kii sarkaar buree tarah chook gai or ab supreme court main latadi ja rahi he
 The fact is that in your second term in Delhi, AAP could not yet construct a positive model of alternative politics and it also slipped into governance at a time when it should have been more sensitive
 sankramak rogon kii aamad nai nahin he, lekin dilli sarkaar, shaayad, centre se ladaai main uljhi thi, chunavi raajnneeti main zyada masaroof thi yaa phir ati aatmavishvaas se ghiri thi
 The effects of diseases or accidents end with time, but among them people want to see the government battling with them
 aise maukon par videsh yatra karte netaa, betuke tark dete kaaryakarta, duusari agenciyon par aarope lagaate mantri or sawaalon par khijhate mantri rajnatik nuksaan kii guarantee hai
 AAP leaders may see the shadow of political conspiracy in the actions of the Raj Bhavan of Delhi, but if there is any conspiracy, the party should have reacted more consciously
 lekin is nai party ko takaraav ke alaava koi duusari raajnneeti shaayad nahin aati
 Therefore, on the basic work of governance, you made the conflict a dialogue
 is lambey jhagade main na keval gavarnence khet rahi balki saaf-safai jaisi buniyadi gavarnence main chook ke liye supreme court ne aap ke mantri par jurmaana laga diya, jo apni tarah kaa pehla udhaaharan he
 The party will certainly realize the political damage, as most of the people affected by infectious diseases are from Nirvana and middle class in Delhi, which is the basis of aap's new politics
 aap ko nai raajnneeti or nai gavarnence, donon kaa avishkaar karnaa tha
 This party did not emerge from the regional, ethnic and ideological mints of Indian politics
 ise gavarnence main badlaav ke andolan ne gadha tha
 Incidentally, this party got a grand mandate to run for power in the country's capital, so the hopes of a new politics and new government are bound to be there
 dilli sarkaar ke paas simit adhikaar hai, yah baat nai nahin he lekin inhen simaaon ke bich kejariwal ko sakaaratmak gavarnence kii raajnneeti kerani thi
 aap's political beginnings in Delhi came from disintegration and governance began with confrontation
 satta main aate hi party kaa bhitari loktantr dhwast ho gaya
 Therefore, the hopes of alternative politics could not take root
 dilli sarkaar se gavarnence ke nae prayogon kii apeksha bhi thi jo centre kii sarkaar ke bainks ek sakaaratmak vipakshi samvaad kaa aadhaar ban sakate the
 The truth is that apart from direct confrontation, you could not develop a sharp and factual critique of the governance and policies of the Center
 aarthik, niti, videsh niti, saamaajik sevaaon se lekar rojgaar or gramin arthvyavastha tak sabhi par, aadhunik or bhavishioparak sanvaadon kii jarurat he, jise shuru karne kaa mauka aap ke paas tha
 AAP also had to show new governance in Delhi to prepare such dialogues
 lekin 49 din ke pichley prayog kii naseehaton ke baavjood arvind kejariwal apni sarkaar ko prashasan ke aise abhinav taur-tareekon kii prayogshaala nahin bana sake, jo unki rashtriya mahatvakankshaon kaa aadhaar ban sakate the
 This is the reason why you could not make a place in the positive and qualitative dialogues of politics and governance, only to collect headlines of confrontation with the center
 satta main aane ke baad kai maheenon tak modi sarkaar ke netaa bhi pichhali sabhi museebaton ke liye congress ko koste rahe the
 It was a kind of opposition dialogue that is not expected of the government
 dedh saal baad modi sarkaar ne apane samvaad badale, kriyanvayan par dhyaan diya or vipaksh se sahmati banaai, to gavarnence main bhi sakriyata najar ai
 Similarly, for every problem, Kejriwal's serial confrontation with the Center was dragged a bit longer due to which the governance could not be activated and the Delhi government could not even do that work
 rashtriya rajdhani main aap kii sarkaar ke tajurbe puure desh main gambhirtha se parakhe ja rahe hai
 In Punjab or Goa elections, voters have the option of trying out old parties
 isliye yadi aap khud ko vikalp maanati he to use dhyaan rakhana hoga ki in chunaavon main dilli kii gavarnence kaa sandarbh jarur aayega
 As of now, the party's election dialogues do not reflect policies addressing the future of Punjab or Goa
 machhar maarane main chook or raajnneeti par supreme court se latad khaanaa kisi bhi sarkaar kii saakh par baari padegaa kyonki is tarah ke kaam to buniyadi gavarnence kaa hissaa hai
 This misery is serious for AAP as Kejriwal (between Delhi's constitutional boundaries) emerged with the hope of introducing new arrangements
 ab unhen sabase pehle dilli main apni sarkaar kaa ilaaj karnaa chahie or takaraavon se nikalakar sakaaratmak badlaavon ke pramaan saamne laane chahie
 Your mandate rests on weak ground
 uske paas vicharadhara, parivaar va bhugolic vistaar jaisaa kuch nahin he, jiske boote puraane dal baar-baar ug aate hai
 The AAP is faced with the heat of expectations and strong competitive politics
 isliye asafalataa kaa jokhim kisi bhi puraane dal kii tulana main kai guna zyada he
 Kejriwal must really feel this fear: One or two major lapses of governance can turn into discussions about his politics being over
 pareshaaniyon or vivaadon se ghiri hollywood adaakara lindse lohan ko ab shaayad kuch raahat mahasoos hogi kyonki unke samarthan main ab auskar puraskaar jeet chukin adaakara monic or reality tivi kii mashhoor hasti kim kardashiyaan aa gai hai
 Monique and Kardashian have asked critics not to say anything about Lohan anymore
 kantactomusec kii report ke mutabik, monic ab khulkar lohan ke samarthan main aa gayi hai or unhone kaha ki lohan ko akelaa chhod diya janaa chahie taaki ve apni museebaton se ubar saken
 Lohan has been in constant trouble for the last few months

 The song 'pal mein paal tata baji' bihar vidhansabha ke aagaamee chunaav prachaar kaa shankhanaad karne vaali bhaajapa kii bihar swabhimaan raily main rajya ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii kami ko sweekaar karte hue party ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne manmutav bhulaakar saath milakar agle chunaav kaa saamana karne kaa aagrah kiya
 Advani said in an attempt to calm the controversy surrounding Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and Nitish's advertisements, "pique continues, and the advertisement which shows Nitish and Modi shaking hands, shaking hands is a sign of friendship is
 ’’ unhone aagrah kiya ki aisi baton ko zyada tool na diya jaae
 It is noteworthy that the Chief Minister reacted sharply to advertisements in Bihar newspapers with photographs of Nitish with Narendra Modi and he also canceled a dinner for BJP leaders on Saturday
 iske baad kayaas lagaaye ja rahe the ki bhaajapa or jad you ke bich saajhedaari tut jaaegi
 During his address at the historic Gandhi Maidan, Advani said, "I would be very happy if Nitish would have been in this huge rally today
" ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘choti moti baaten hoti rahati hai, lekin mujhe vishwaas he ki rajg agar vaise hi kaam karata rahaa, jaisaa bihar main kushasan ko sushasan main badalakar kiya to ham hindustan bhar main safal rahenge
 "in other words, the BJP leader reminded Nitish that during the BJP session in Mumbai in 1995, George Fernandes was admitted in the Jaslok Hospital and when he went to see him, Nitish was also present there
" adwani ne kaha ki us samay unhone nitish se aagrah kiya ki ve adhiveshan main aayen or unhen is baat kii bahut khushi he ki nitish us adhiveshan main aaye
 He praised Nitish and said that later when the NDA was formed, Nitish was a very successful minister in it
 haalanki modi sahit kisi anya vaktaa ne nitish kaa naam nahin liya tha or sabane bihar ke vikaas ke liye up mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ko shrey diya
 This Nitish praise of Advani suggests that the BJP does not want to give too much weight to the advertisement matter and wants to contest the next assembly elections with JD-U only

 The alliance talks between Congress and AAP may have failed, but Union Minister Harsh Vardhan believes that if this alliance had happened, it would have benefited BJP not only in Lok Sabha elections but also in next year's assembly elections

 Personally, i think it would have been better for the BJP if they had aligned and if we had defeated them with that understanding, then we would have taken care of it in the next election as well
 'harshavardhan ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki vah aashwast hai ki rashtriya rajdhani main loksabhaa kii sabhi saat siton par bhaajapa jeetegi or vishwaas he ki bhaajapa donon partiyon congress or aap se kaaphi aage rahegi
 The Union Minister said, 'as far as BJP is concerned, if there was an alliance between the two parties (congress, AAP), i would be the happiest person in Delhi
 chaahe ve akele laden yaa saath main, ham jeetne ja rahe hai
 'he said,' BJP is far ahead of both parties, whether they are together or apart
 bhaajapa ko logon se jabardast pratikriya mil rahi hai
 In such a situation, no other question arises in this whole situation
 ' gauratlab he ki kaaphi baatcheet ke baad bhi congress or aam aadmi party (aap) ke bich gathbandhan nahin ho sakaa
 In the Lok Sabha elections, Harshvardhan is a BJP candidate from Chandni Chowk parliamentary seat, where he faces Jai Prakash Aggarwal of Congress and Pankaj Gupta of AAP

 unhone mausam vibhaag ke khilaaf police main dhara 420 ke tahat likhit shikaayat darj karai he
 Raju Shetty says that the Meteorological Department had predicted a monsoon earlier this year
 mausam vibhaag ne anumaan lagaaya tha ki desh main ausat aankadon ke upar barish hogi
 Shetty alleges that in many districts of the state, the ban was equal, due to which farmers have been sown again
 aapako bataa den ki raju shetty ne kuch hi din pehle doodh utpaadak kisaanon ke liye bhi andolan kiya tha
 Milk agitation was organized in Maharashtra by activists of Shetty, MP from Kolhapur to get fair prices for the milk producing farmers

 In Nagpur monsoon session, the government brought out an ordinance to give a price of Rs 25 per liter to the milk producing farmers

 He says that famine conditions are prevailing in a large part of Marathwada and Vidarbha areas

 The farmer feels cheated by the Meteorological Department

 Now it will have to be seen how the police investigate this case

 ' aap hawaii yatra ke dauraan kisi kaaran se funs jate hai or aapaki connecting flite chhot gai to dijisie kaa yah prastaav aapke liye behad khaas he
 The Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has proposed a change in the passenger's list of rights to pay a fine of Rs 20,000 to the airline passenger if the connecting flight of a passenger is missed due to late flight or cancellation
 Will do
 paisanger ke adhikaron main dijisie ne badlaav kaa yah prastaav diya he ki yadi kisi airlines ne kisi paisanger ko jabaran boarding dene se manaa kiya to us paisanger ko 5,000 rupee kaa muaavja adaa kiya jayega
 Usually, airlines do not issue board passes to some passengers due to overbooking and passengers have to book tickets from other flights
 dijisie ne yah prastaav boarding paas nahin dene kii ghatnaon main ho rahe ijaphe ke baad diya he
 However, these proposals of DGCA have been opposed by the Federation of Indian Airlines (FIA) and non-fia airlines such as Vistara and Air Asia India
 gauratlab he ki dijisie ne pehali baar itane bade muaavje kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 Read this: Air travel became easier, passenger will not have to keep boarding
 Apart from these proposals, DGCA has also proposed that if a flight has a Tarmac delay of more than 120 minutes (when an airplane is waiting on the runway to fly (or taking time to issue a forward flight in case of immediate landing), then in such a situation, the passenger has to get off the plane and cancel his journey Dikar be

 In protest against these proposals, Jet Airways, indigo and Go Air have demanded that the existing rules be continued
 maujuuda samay main aise vilamb kii sthiti main paisanger ko kisi tarah ke harjane kaa praavdhaan nahin he
 However, Vistara has demanded before the final verdict on these proposals that DGCA should make separate provision for compensation for domestic and international flights

 Along with this, the Ministry had asked the DGCA to propose to cut the air ticket cancellation fees as well as offer compensation to the passengers in case of missed flights
 dilli hai court ke aadesh ke baad aam aadmi party ne bhale hi aakraamak pratikriya di ho or aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti dene kii baat bhi kahi

 sisodiya ne bataaya ki unhone alji se aagrah kiya he ki peedblyoody secretary or health secretary ko na hataaya jaae, kyonki ye donon afasar shiksha or swasthya ke kaam ko bahut behatar dhang se kar rahe hai
 Significantly, the Delhi government has traditionally appointed officers of other services at the place of appointment of IAS
 peedbludi secretary ek ejineering sarvice ke afasar ko banaaya gaya he, jabaki health department main ek doctor ko secretary banaaya gaya he
 Sisodia claimed that an engineer can run the PWD much better and the health department can understand the doctor in the same manner

 Just a month before today, on 26 April, Gionee launched two new budget smartphones Gionee S11 Lite and F205 while making a comeback in the market
 hamane S11 Lite ko upyog kiya he or ab ham iskaa rivyuu aap tak pahunchaa rahe hai
 The company has priced it at Rs 13,999
 keemat ke hisaab se ye thik vahi segment he jahaan Xiaomi, Moto or Asus kaa kabja he
 So here we are telling you how successful the company's market comeback was
 bilt-quality or disple:aamtaur par is segment ke smartfones ke back panel par metal body di jaati he, lekin jioni ne is smartphone ke back panel main plastic kii body di he
 The body is plastic but gives a fill glass one
 company ke logo back panel par bottm main diya gaya he
 Also, there is a dual camera setup, fingerprint sensor and flash in the back
 plastic body hone kii vajah se is smartphone kaa vajan kaaphi kam he or ye kaaphi acchhee baat he
 Talking about the look, its overall look is also very premium
 back panel glouci finnish vaala he
 For this reason, fingerprints start appearing after a while
 wolum rocker or power kaa batan rhite said main diya gaya he or tip bi charging port, audio jaik or spikar neeche kii taraf die gaye hai
 We expected Type c in terms of the price of the smartphone
 baharhaal, disple kii baat karen to Gionee S11 Lite main 2
 5 with 5D Gorilla Glass
 70-inch HD+ phul vyuu disple diya gaya he
 That is, this smartphone lacks full HD display
 chunki is keemat vaale smartfones meniadh+disple diya jaataa he
 According to this recent trend, 18: 9 ratio has also been given which gives you better fill during movie or video
 is smartphone ke disple kaa colors or britaness kaa rispons behatar he, haalanki dhoop main ise upyog karne ke vakt aapako britaness badhaane kii jarurat padegi
 This smartphone is also better viewing angle
 lekin tach ko lekar hamen kaaphi shikaayat he
 Its touch is not smooth
 bydaree:is smartphone main 3030mah kii bydaree he or company ne ise single charge main puri din tak chalane kaa vaada kiya he
 Here the company's claim justifies
 hamanen ise lagaataar primary phone ke taur kaaphi zyada upyog kiya he or is smartphone kii bydaree kaaphi had tak aapkaa saath nibhaati he, lekin utani nahin ki iskaa muqabla is range main maujuud baaki smartfones se kiya ja sake
 If you run internet via wi-fi, then this smartphone supports you for a little longer, but the battery leaves the battery quickly due to running on mobile network
 saath hi aapako vishesh taur par bataa den ise charge karne bhi kaaphi vakt lagata he
 However, we charged the charger of another company, as the company did not send the charger during the review
 ye mumkin ho saktaa he ki company ke charger se bydaree jaldi charge ho jaae
 Camera: Talking about the camera present in this smartphone, two cameras of 13 megapixels and 2 megapixels have been given in its back
 vahiin iske front main 16 megapixl kaa camera maujuud he
 First of all talk about its back camera, its performance is very disappointing
 yadi aap dual camere dekhte hi boke mod kii ummid karte hai to aapako behad niraashaa hogi
 Because you will not see sharpness on the border of any subject
 saath hi focus karne ke dauraan bhi aapako kaaphi mashkkat kerani padegi
 Apart from this, its shutter also gives slow response and it is extremely difficult to lock focus without portrait mode
 liting conditions par baat karen to paryaapt raushan main photose to clic ho jaati he lekin diteling nahin milti he
 Also, while taking macro photos, you will be very disappointed about sharpness
 isi tarah lo lite main pareshaani or bhi bad jaati he
 Even if you increase the ISO using manual mode, the detailing is still very less
 yani aap lo-lite main is mobile se acchhee photography kii ummid kar hi nahin sakate
 Now if you talk about selfie camera then some degree of camera is better here
 behatar liting condishan main camera behatar rispons karata he, lekin lo-lite main phir se nois kii dikkat saamne aa jaati he
 But the front camera is still better than the back camera
 front camere se video colling kaa bhi hamaara anubhav behatar rahaa
 Performance: Talking about the specifications given in this smartphone, it has 4 GB RAM and 1 with Adreno 505 GPU
 4ghz kii speed vaala kwalkom snapadragon 430 procesar diya gaya he
 Its internal memory is 32GB which can be increased to 256GB with the help of card
 ye smartphone android 7
 1 Nougat based custom Amigo 5
 0 par chalata he
 The processor of this smartphone has disappointed the most because in this price range, smartphones are expected to have a 600 series of 400 series processors
 jab aap is smartphone main eps ke bich switch karenge to yaheen par ye lag karne lagegaa
 The smartphone is so slow that if you want to open the number dial pad, you will have to give a few seconds
 saath hi jab aap ek saath kai eps open kar unhen saath hi upyog karne lagen to ye smartphone puri tarah hang ho jaataa he
 Likewise, if a lot of notifications come together, the performance of the phone will disappoint you
 haalanki heavi games khelte vakt is smartphone kaa anubhav kuch had thik rahaa
 But i would like to complain about getting hot
 in sabake alaava agar fingerprint sensor kii baat karen to yahaan bhi ye kaaphi peeche thahartaa he
 Its fingerprint sensor also responds in a long time
 alam ye rahaa ki hamane kai dfa pattern kaa upyog karnaa zyada behatar samajha
 The rest of this smartphone has pre-loaded apps like UC Browser, Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and whatsapp
 faisla:aap graahakon ko is smartphone main paisa lagane kii salaah main katai nahin duungaa
 Because better products from other companies are available in the market in this price range
 khaskar isse bhi kam keemat main shaomi ke kaaphi smartfones maujuud hai
 One of the highlights of this smartphone is its light and premium look
 baaki chaahe camera ho yaa overol parformens sabhi maamalon main ye smartphone kaaphi peeche he

 After GST, the state government also does not fix indirect tax
 vahiin rajya sarkarein ab aabkaari or nigam jaise karon kaa nirdhaaran karti hai
