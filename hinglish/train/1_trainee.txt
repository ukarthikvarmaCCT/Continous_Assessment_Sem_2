 Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked the critics at the Golden Jubilee function of the Indian Company Secretaries Institute by taking the name of surgery
 haalanki yahaan unhone khulkar kisi kaa naam nahin liya, lekin unki baton se prathit hota he ki nishane par arun shouri or yashavanth sinha the
 He said that people with surgical tendencies have started creating a ruckus when the economy has slowed down a bit, as if everything has gone wrong
 isse pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi jab mangalvaar shaam ko dilli ke vigyaan bhawan main indian company secretaries institute ke golden jubilee samaaroh main shaamil hone ke liye shaam ko 6:00 baje pahunche, to sabko yah abhas ho gaya tha ki aaj kaa samaaroh kuch khaas hone vaala he
 At the function of Vigyan Bhawan, TP was installed at the place where the Prime Minister spoke
 tipi yani transperency vah mashin he, jiskaa istemaal bhaashan dene ke samay netaa tab karte hai, jab unhen kuch likhaa hua padhanaa hota he
 Narendra Modi does not usually use transparency
 kyapradhanmantri narendra modibhaashan dene ke liye aae to is taiyaari kaa matlab jald hi samaj main aa gaya
 The Prime Minister responded selectively to the issues raised by his critics on the slow economy, lack of jobs and the economic condition of the country
 aisa pehali baar hua he, jab kisi pradhanmantri ne vigyaan bhawan ke kaarykram main apane bhaashan ke dauraan apni baat ko rakhane ke liye power point pregentation kaa istemaal kiya
 By presenting one figure after another on the grand screen of Vigyan Bhavan, Modi tried to silence his critics
 pradhanmantri ne bhaashanki shuruyaat main hi mahabharat ke us shalya kii kahani sunai, jo karn kaa sarathi tha or jiskaa kaam tha lagaataar niraashajanak baaten bolkar karn ko hatotsahit karnaa, taaki uskaa manobal tut jaae
 Modi said that surgery is not just the name of a person, but the name of a trend, who always have the same objective to spread an atmosphere of despair and to say that everything is going wrong
 puri taiyaari ke saath pradhanmantri ne silsilewar tareeke se ek ke baad ek aaropon kaa jawaab diya or kaha ki kuch log gandagi failaane main lage hai
 Therefore, his government has been engaged in cleanliness campaign since the beginning
 modi ne kaha ki shalya kii pravriti vaale log arthvyavastha kii raftaar jaraa si dhimi hone par aise hangaamaa machaane lage hai, jaise sab kuch gadabad ho chukaa ho
 Modi said that this is not the first time that the GDP figures have come down
 lekin sirf is aankade ke dam par aisa maahaul banaaya ja rahaa he jaise modi sarkaar ke teen saal main kuch hua hi nahin
 Modi then circled opponents in the data cycle and compared his government to the upa's three-year rule, trying to prove that his government had performed better in most cases
 jaise modi ne kaha ki log sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki logon kii naukarinyaa ja rahi hai or aamadani kam ho rahi he
 But the truth is that in the last two months, sales of vehicles have increased a lot
 unhone sawaal uthaaya ki agar logon kii aamadani kam ho rahi hoti, to kya gadiyon kii bikri babbti?modi ne aath navbanr kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki notebandi ke din ko shaayad aage bhrashtachar mitaane ke diwas ke rup main manaaya jayega
 Assuring the businessmen, Modi said that many people are afraid that after coming under the purview of GST, their old accounts should not be sacked, but it will not happen because they want to give people a chance to start a new beginning
 
 modi ne yah bhi kaha ki agar jiesti ko lagu karne main koi galati yaa chook hui he yaa phir kahin sudhaar karne kii jarurat he, to wo iske liye taiyaar hai
 He said that he also does not say that all the things of the opponents are wrong, but he cannot put the future of the country at stake for fear of criticism or to secure his present

 They are particularly considering an open debate, after which the motion will be voted on

 2017 kaa puraa saal is kashmakash main beetaa ki kahin america or uttar korea ke bich parmaanu yuddh naa chhid jaae
 Because the situation had become like this only
 magar phir dakshin korea
 China and Russia intervened
 
 And Kim Jong, sitting on a nuclear missile, persuaded him to come to the negotiating table
 hairaani to tab hui jab singapore main donald trump ke saath kim jong un ne haath milaayaa
 And at the behest of America, it also blew up its nuclear site
 yakeen to nahin ho rahaa tha
 But the world still believed
 sochaa, kim badal gaya he
 But it is not so
 kyonki kim phir apane tevar main laut aayaa he
 North Korea again showed cold to America
 duniya par phir mandaraaya parmaanu bam kaa khatra
 Kim Jong-un will not threaten nuclear disarmament
 america band kare uttar korea ko dhamkaana
 Kim Jong Un woke up again! kim jong un ne puraa kiya vaada!12 may 2018 ko north korea ke shaasha marshalakim jong unne bayaan diya tha ki agar mausam thik rahaa to 23 se 25 may tak desh ke madhya pungye-ri parmaanu pareekshan sthal ko nasht kar diya jayega
 And before meeting US President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12, North Korea's Marshal Kim Jong Un promised to dismantle its nuclear site in Pungye-ri
 apane vaade ke mutabik usne duniyabar ke patrakaron ke saamne pungye-ri kii is site ko kai dhamaakon se zameendos kar bhi diya
 But this is Kim
 jo nazar to aata he
 But do not understand
 america samaj rahaa tha ki usne apane dushman ko ghutanon par laa diya
 But he forgot that Kim always has a Plan B
 pyong-ri kii site ko agar usne duniya bhar kii media ke camaron ke saamne tabah kiya
 So instead of hiding from the world, he prepared 13 such secret hideouts where he is advancing his ballistic missile program
 to kya samajha jaae ki kim ne duniya se vaadakhilaphi kii he? satellite tasveeron ne kim kii pole khol di he
 North Koreans have built 13 intelligence missile bases
 isse sawaal uthta he ki kya uttar korea kaa shaasha kim jong america ko dhokhaa de rahaa he?uttar korea ke dineuclirizeshan kii hakeekat ye he ki wo khud ko naram dikhaakar america pratibandhon se chhot paane kii aad main rus or china ke saath phir se vyapaar shuru karnaa chahta tha
 Which was stuck because of US sanctions
 magar ab pataa chalaa he ki wo sab dhokhaa tha
 In fact, programs such as nuclear weapons, missile nuclear materials, mobile launchers in North Korea are still continuing in its secret hideouts hidden in the mountains
 satellite tasveeron main uttar korea kapermanu shaktise las apni mixilon ko chhipaane ke liye 13 thikaane nazar aae hai
 But it is being speculated that this number may also be 20
 america centre for stratagic and international studies yani siess ke researchron ne is bare main jo report jari kii he
 According to that report, North Korea has 13 secret missile bases
 inaki sankhya 20 bhi ho sakati he
 Satellite photos show that North Korea is engaged in a large nuclear campaign
 uttar korea ek baar phir se parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa jakhira taiyaar karne main jute gaya he
 After this revelation about North Korea, the condition of US President Donald Trump has become such that he is unable to swallow and swallow the name of Kim Jong
 kyonki singapore main kim se mulaakaat se pehle trump ne hi duniya ko ye yakeen dilaayaa tha ki kim ne unki baat maanate hue apane parmaanu kaarykram ko chhod diya he
 Therefore, US President Donald Trump claims to be neutralizing North Korea's nuclear threat, despite North Korea's secret missile program targets appearing in satellite photos
 trump ne abhi tak is satellite tasveeron par bhi chuppi sadhi hui he
 However, before these satellite photos, the United Nations also released a report in the month of August, saying that North Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile program
 suraksha parishad ko bheji gai 62 panne kii report main visheshgyon ne kaha tha ki pyongyang sanyukt raashtra pratibandhon kaa ulanghan karte hue petroleum utpaadon, koyala, loha, samudri bhojan or duusare utpaadon kaa niryaat kar rahaa he

 On 15 April, the controversy of the Divas celebrating in Mumbai has cooled down
 maharashtra nav nirmaan sena pramukh raaj thakare ne apni sharton par aayojan karne kii enosi aayojakon kii de di he
 Raj Thackeray had opposed Bihar Day in Mumbai, also demanded a ban on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar from attending the function
 isapar nitish ne kaha tha ki mumbai aane ke liye vija kii jarurat nahin he
 Raj then retaliated in Malegaon
 kul mila kar maamla bahut garma rahaa tha jisapar ab pani daal diya he
 JDU leaders associated with organizing the event in Mumbai celebrated Raj Thackeray
 raaj thakare ne aapatti jataai thi ki is aayojan ke bahaane uttar bhartiya apana shakti pradarshan karnaa chaahate hai lekin aayojakon ne bataaya ki ye sirf bihar ke gathan ke sau saal puraa hone par kiya ja rahaa ek saamaajik saanskrithik aayojan he
 By the way, targeting North Indians has been the foundation of Raj Thackeray's politics, but this time Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was in front of MNS beating his Bihari students going to Mumbai to test their jobs
 unhone raaj kii chunauti ke jawaab main kaha tha ki desh main kisi ko kahin jane ke liye vija kii jarurat nahin he
 jdu's ally BJP in Bihar was also angry with the controversy, which Raj Thackeray wants to weaken the Shiv Sena
 udhar,maharashtra ke grahamantralay ne bihar diwas ke aayojan kii suraksha ke maddenjar pulisia taiyaariyaan tej kar di thim
 In such a situation, when the organizers persuaded Raj, he considered it better to accept it so that his honor would be maintained
 raaj thakare har wo mudda taan dete hai jisase ye sabit ho sake ki wo marathi maanush kii ladaai ke ekmev netaa hai
 He used this case also for this reason
 marathiyon ko yaad dilaayaa ki tumhaara netaa main hum
 The reality of this protest was nothing more than this
 piem modi aaj dopaher main vimaan se aaenge or echemaar pariyojna ke udghaatan ke liye miapur jaaenge
 He will then visit the Hyderabad International Convention Center (HICC) for the inauguration of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit
 isamen america raashtrapati donald trump kii putree evam salaahkaar ivaanka trump sahit anya videshi pratinidhi hissaa lenge
 (from input language) raashtrapati ramnath kovind apane pad kii shapath le chuke hai
 With this, 'ram' Raj will start in Rashtrapati Bhavan from today
 ji haa, 'ram'raaj
 Because now the 14th President of the country Ramnath Kovind is going to live here
 yun to har raashtrapati ke saath raisina hills kaa nayaa daur shuru hota he
 But this time the whole era is changing with President Ramnath Kovind as it is the era of the first President of BJP and especially Prime Minister Modi's choice
 raashtrapati bhawan main ramnath kovind kaa raaj ek nae yug kaa aagaaj kai myanon main ahm he
 Along with being the second Dalit President of the country, Kovind's era is also a period of many important and sensitive issues in the country
 videshi morchon par china or pakistan ke raksha se jude masale hai
 Because the President of the three armies is the President, there are domestic fronts like Darjeeling, Jammu and Kashmir where the advice of the President will be very important
 party kii chhavi se baahar nikalnarashtrapati kisi party kaa nahin hota vah desh kaa hota he
 The first challenge for President Kovind will be that this stain should not be found on him
 haalanki ve rajyapal jaisaa jimmedaar pad nibhaa chuke hai jaahir he is pad par unka raajnneetik anubhav kaaphi madad karegaa
 After becoming the President, Kovind will have to renounce his party membership as well as play the role of an impartial arbitrator for the next five years
 seemaa surakshasima suraksha in dinon bharat ke liye sabase gambhir mudda he
 The dispute with China in Doklam in Sikkim region between Jammu and Kashmir and Tanatani is also at the height of China
 aise main teenon senaaon kii kaman apane haath main lene vaale raashtrapati ramnath kovind kii sabase badi chunauti hogi ke ve is samasya se nikalne kii kya salaah dete hai
 The situation in the states is full of poison of separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and there is a dispute over demand of Gorkhaland in Darjeeling
 centre ke saath kai rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 It would also be worth looking at what the President's advice would be for political stability and peace restoration in all parts of the country
 gauratlab he ki pichley saal pranab mukherjee ne arunachal pradesh or uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke faisle ko manjuuri de di thi, lekin kuch hi dinon baad supreme court ne donon faisle palat die the
 These decisions will always be a blot on Pranab Mukherjee's tenure
 kovind ko aise faislon se bachanaa hoga or nishpaksh hokar sanvaidhanik dayitvon ko puraa karnaa hoga
 Under these circumstances, the fairness of Ramnath Kovind will continue to be challenged
 lambit vidheyakapako bataa den ki apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne kareeb 156 rajya vidheyakon ko manjuuri di
 He also returned several bills for reconsideration
 pranab mukherjee ne rajyon dwaara bheje gaye un vidheyakon ko kabhi manjuuri nahin di, jo sangathit aparaadh se ladane ke naam par maanavadhikaron ke hanan kii vajah ban sakate the
 Now that Ram Nath Kovind is on the presidency, the Modi government's NDA government will feel relieved
 ab sarkaar chaahe to adhyadesh laakar apane tamaam lambit vidheyak paas kara sakati he
 Article 123 of the Indian Constitution also allows the President to do this
 lekin aise main kovind par modi sarkaar kaa 'rabar stamp' banane kaa thappa lagegaa
 How Kovind gets out of this challenge will also be watched
 mob linchingdesh ke lagbhag sabhi rajyon main mob linching kii ghatnaayen bad rahi hai
 In his last address to the country, former President Pranab Mukherjee also expressed sorrow over this matter
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki in muddon par desh ke 14wein raashtrapati kya rukh akhriyaar karte hai

 Vishal Varma, head of 'mangal Panchayatan Parishad', said that during excavation in Dhar district, about 125 km from here, we found about thirty nests of dinosaurs, which were buried under rocks after geographical changes thousands of years ago
 unka anumaan he ki inamen se har ghonsle main dianosor ke kam se kam 10 andon ke kholon ke jeevashm hai
 The 'mangal Panchayatan Parishad' first attracted worldwide attention when it discovered the prized 'jurassic treasures' as prized as around 25 nests of dinosaurs in Dhar district during the year 2007
 verma ne bataaya ki unke khojakarta samooh ko in ghonslon main dianosor ke sau se zyada andon ke jeevashm mili the
 The rarest nest among them was the one in which 12 fossils of dinosaurs were found together

 Varma points out that the newly discovered dinosaur nests are within a 20-kilometer radius of the proposed garden, but they are completely different from the nests discovered in 2007 and may open new layers of dinosaur history

 yah kaaphi behtareen edia tha, lekin maine ise sunakar ansuna karte hue twitor kii dikkaton ko thik karne ke liye apane computer screen par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 Because Twitter was shut down because of this, 'twitter says founder Bij Stone,' Chris Messina and our conversation ended with jokes and the joke was, this is a good idea, we will work on it
 baatchee ke baad wo chale gaye or unhone twitor par isi edia ko phir se propose kiya

 enie ne 'aaj tak' ke sting oparation main pakistan se ho rahi hawala funding kii baat kaboolne vaale naeem khan, bitta karate, javed baba sahit duusare logon ke khilaaf jaanch shuru kii

 The secret of two corpses is deepened in two boxes found in Tau Devi Lal Park, 50 meters from GT Karnal Road-1 of delhi-haryana Highway
 teen din bitne ke baad bhi police abhi tak donon marane vaale ladke or ladki kii shinaakht tak nahin kar pai he or naa hi aasapaas ke ilaake se koi shaks kisi ladke yaa phir kisi ladki kii gumshudagi kii report likhavane uske paas aayaa he
 In such a situation, the police announced a reward of one lakh rupees to give the clue of the slayer and started the practice of pasting the posters of photographs of both the dead in the area
 ladki kii maut, horer kiling kaa shaqakhir ye katl horer kiling kaa nateeja hai yaa phir kaatilon ne donon ko aapasi ranjish kii vajah se maaraa he ye baat bhi police abhi tak tay nahin kar pai he
 It is certain that those who have done this double murder are more than one
 kyonki jis andaaj main donon kii hatya karne ke baad unki laashon ko trunk main rakhaa gaya or phir unhen kisi gaadi main rakh kar dilli-haryana haive ke najadik ke taaoo devilal park main pahunchaaya gaya usase saaf jaahir hota he ki kaatil ek se zyada hai
 Also, the killers have carried out this incident in a very vicious manner
 horer kiling se dahali mumbai, pita ne rape kar garbhvatee beti kii hatya kipulice abhi tak ye bhi tay nahin kar pai he ki aakhir donon marane waalon kaa aapas main rishta kya he
 The police philosophers have not even been able to know whether the two people were residents of the surrounding area or whether the murderers killed both of them and put them in two trunks with a view to hide the corpses
 Away from Tau Devi Lal Park on delhi-haryana Highway
 police ke mutabik unhen mauka-e-vaardaat or donon trunk se kuch ahm suraag mili hai
 One of them is the trade mark on the trunk and some special mark
 uski binah par police nen aasapaas ke trunk banane waalo se bhi poochtacha kii he
 Of course, the police is doing so many exercises, but its hands are still empty and time is passing by
 aise main dar is baat kaa he ki kahin iskaa phayda uthaakar kaatil kanoon kii pakad se dur naa ho jaaen
 Usually the murderer always tries to erase the evidence
 par yahaan donon bakse par baqayada laal rang se kuch shabd likhe gaye
 At present, the police are trying to solve the puzzle of murder from both the boxes
 darasal is bakse kii ek aisi khaasiyat he jo police ko kaatil tak pahunchaa sakati he
 According to police sources, this box can also prove to be very important in opening the case
 or police ke is yakeen kii vajah he is bakse kii banaavat
 Actually, these boxes are very popular in the villages and towns of Haryana, Punjab
 ye bakse khaas taur par shaadi-byaah ke dauraan ladki ke ghar vaale apni ladki ko dete hai
 Neither the clothes are spoiled nor there is any scope to munch on the clothes of the mice
 phir majbootee kii vajah se bhi aise bakse in ilaakon main kaaphi bikate hai
 Apart from the boxes, the special lock-key design found with the box can also shed considerable light on the case
 katilon tak pahunchane ke liye police ne kai timen banaain hai
 Also, information is being collected about the trains passing from delhi-haryana highway from Sunday night to Monday morning so that one can get eyewitnesses who have seen people kept in Buxa Park
 vaise police ko shaq he ki agar maamla sachmuch horer kiling kaa niklaa to phir maa-baap in donon kii gumshudagi kii report likhaane police ke paas nahin jaaenge
 On the contrary, they will try to suppress it
 isiilie police is cese ko sulajhane ke liye apane mukhabiron kii joro-shor se madad le rahi he
 Prisoners serving jail terms are released when they complete their sentences, but can a prisoner be released for his stature? Didn't you feel a bit strange to hear? But something similar happened in London
 7 feet or 2 inch lambey ek apradhi ko isliye chhod diya gaya kyonki uske liye jail ke bed or kaidiyon kii uniform choti pad gai
 Jude Medkaff, a resident of Devon, London, suffers from a Rare Growth Disorder and is released by Exeter Crown Court
 jail main madacaf ke sies kaa bed nahin tha or na hi unke sies kii uniform
 After which the judge decided that Medkaf, who is suffering from the growth disorder 'kleinfelter syndrome', should be released
 madacaf ne khidki se ek mahila ke upar air gan se fire kar use daraaya tha or uske baad ek offis se christmas gift or tii mani churaane chalaa gaya tha
 Medclaf has spent 75 days in custody and had to face a lot of problems during this time

 He was supposed to surrender by 18 April, but on 17 April, the court gave 4 weeks to surrender on his petition
 unhen abhi 5 saal kii sajaa main se 42 maheene or jail main bitaane hai
 Significantly, last month, Sanjay Dutt had asked for 6 months to surrender citing business reasons
 unki yachika par sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne kaha tha, 'is maamle main badi raahat kii gunjaaish nahin he
 However, you may be given four weeks' deferment to eliminate your professional responsibilities
 'sanjay dutt ko mumbai kii tada adaalat ne 6 saal kii sajaa sunai thi, lekin sheersh adaalat ne ise ghataakar 5 saal kar diya tha
 The court also refused to release him on probation, given the seriousness of his crime

 modi se takkar lene ke liye vipaksh ekajute ho rahaa he
 Due to the efforts of Congress and Lalu, on 27 August, the anti-uttar Pradesh parties SP and BSP will be seen sharing the stage together for the second time
 22 saal baad phir mayawati or mulaayam kaa kunba saath aa saktaa he
 Explain that SP-BSP formed an unprecedented alliance in 1993 and Mulayam Singh took power
 tab saath the mulaayam-maaya1993 main jab espi or bispi ke bich gathbandhan hua tha tab pradesh main babari vidhwans ke baad laga raashtrapati shashan chal rahaa tha
 Due to the temple-mosque dispute, polarization was at its peak
 raajnneetik partiyaan yah baat samaj chuki thim
 In view of the same, Mulayam Singh Yadav, the head of anti-polar parties and Mayawati decided to contest the elections together
 apeksha ke anuroop kisi bhi party ko spasht bahumat nahin mila or gathbandhan ne 4 disambar 1993 ko satta kii bagdor sambhaal lee
 But on 2 June 1995, due to mutual estrangement, the BSP withdrew from the government and announced withdrawal of support
 is vajah se mulaayam singh kii sarkaar alpamat main aa kar gir gai
 After this, on 3 June 1995, Mayawati along with BJP took over the reins of power
 ab ek saath aa sakate hai akhilesh-mayawatiaj se 22 saal pehle espi-bispi kaa gathbandhan 2 june 1995 ko tut gaya tha
 After that, there was a lot of change in the politics of UP
 2 june 1995 kaa apana khud kaa itihaas he
 Well now SP and BSP are talking about getting together to fight the BJP wave once again
 bihar main nitish ke saath milakar bijepi ko haraane vaale argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav is baat kii pahal kar rahe hai
 Both the SP and the BSP have indicated that the foundation of a future alliance may be laid at Lalu's rally in Patna on 27 August
 haal hi main mayawati ne kaha tha ki bijepi ko haraane ke liye ve 'kisi bhi raajnneetik dal' ke saath haath milaane ko taiyaar hai
 At the same time, Akhilesh has talked about the coming together of all opposition parties
 haal hi main apane kannauj daure ke dauraan kaha tha ki agar koi bhavi gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa hogi to 27 agast ko patna main hi hogi
 Akhilesh Yadav has already talked about Sambhayalalu's Patna rally on the alliance
 jabaki raily main mayawati ke shaamil hone par abhi bhi sanshay barkaraar he
 On the other hand, it will not be easy for SP and BSP to forget the sourness of 22 years
 haalanki us vakt kii samaajawaadee party or is vakt kii espi main kaaphi kuch badal chukaa he
 The then SP chief was Mulayam Singh Yadav and now the party is named after Akhilesh Yadav
 ab padhie, 2 june kaa itihaas jisane badal diya mayawati kaa paridhaan2 june 1995 ko upi kii raajnneeti main jo hua vah shaayad hi kahin hua hoga
 Mayawati cannot forget that day and that time throughout her life
 aap us din ko pradesh kii raajnneeti kaa 'blike de' bhi kah sakate hai
 That day a frenzied mob was intent on attacking the BSP supremo's Abaru in the name of teaching a lesson
 upi kii raajnneeti main is kand ko guestaouse kand kaha jaataa he
 This is not only a state but also a stigma on the forehead of the country's politics
 us din ko lekar tamaam baaten hoti rahati hai lekin, yah aaj bhi ek kautuhal kaa hi vishay he ki 2 june 1995 ko lakhanu ke rajya atithi grih main hua kya tha? mayawati ke jivan par aadhaarit ajay bose kii kitaab 'bahanji' main guestaouse main us din ghati ghatana kii jaankaree aapako tasalli se mil sakati he
 In fact, after the withdrawal of Maya's support, when the crisis of the Mulayam government deepened, manipulations were made to save the government
 aise main ant main jab baat nahin bani to espi ke naaraaz kaaryakarta or vidhayak lakhanu ke mirabai maarg sthit state guest house pahunch gaye, jahaan mayawati cameraa number-1 main thahari hui thim
 It is said that on that day, some goons with BSP supremo locked in the guest house room misbehaved and scrambled and tore their clothes
 us din kuch bijepi netaaon or police ke kuch kartavyanishth afasaron ke chalate hi unki jaan batch pai thi
 It is believed that Mayawati changed her way of wearing clothes only after taking lessons from this incident
 guest house cond se pehle mayawati sari pahana karti thim lekin uske baad unhone salwar-kurta pahananaa shuru kar diya
 In the Netaji Subhash Place area of delhi, the condition of an eight-month-old innocent girl, who is a victim of Rishta's brother's lust, is stable after surgery

 com / ci8mcon0nt purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne congress ko gherabhopal se bijepi saansad sadhvi pragna ne bhi ksaa tanjamadhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ke bhai or congress ke vidhayak lakshmana singh ke rahul gandhi par die bayaan se vipaksh main baithi bijepi ko jaise sanjivani mil gai he
 From former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan to Bhopal MP Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur and other BJP leaders have lashed out at the Congress
 lakshmana singh ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha, 'ham log to pehle se hi bol rahe the ki congress ne jhootha vaada kiya
 Falsely promised loan waiver in 10 days, today it has not been 10 months
 kisaan pareshaan hai, puraa system tabah ho gaya he
 Rahul ji, Kamal Nath ji, you ruined and ruined the farmer of Madhya Pradesh and left them nowhere
 'bijepi ko mila hamale kaa maukaawahin, bhopal se saansad sadhvi pragna thakur ne bhi lakshmana singh ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue kaha, 'congress main bhi jinke andar aatma he kyonki aatma kabhi jhooth nahin bolti or jinke andar aatma he vah satya kaa bakhaan karenge hi chaahe kuch ho jaae
 The time is coming and everyone will speak their sins and those who have a pure soul will speak and the truth will come out of their mouths
 'bijepi pravaktaa rajnish agarwal ne kaha, 'madhya pradesh main congress sarkaar kii neenv hi jhooth par khadi he or jhuthe-khokhale vaadon vaali sarkaar se zyada ummid bhi nahin hoti he
 Rajneesh Agarwal said that the government is continuously drinking ghee with the loan because the government treasury is empty, but only by luring promises one after the other, the public is being cheated by Laxman Singh
 bataa den ki congress netaa digvijay singh ke bhai or party vidhayak lakshmana singh ne rahul gandhi se maafee kii maang kii thi
 He had said that Rahul Gandhi should apologize for the statement of waiving farmers' loans in 10 days
 maafee maangane main koi buraai nahin he, rajya main ek bada vittiya sankat he
 Actor and singer Ali Zafar's difficulties are not being named
 pakistani singer misha shafi ke dwaara lagaae gaye yon utpeedan aarope ke baad is maamle main nayaa mode aayaa he
 Ali Zafar is supported by 2 of his colleagues
 ali jafar misha shafi ke aaropon ko jhootha bataa chuke hai
 Now his two female band members (kanja Munir and Aksha Ali) have come in support of singer Ali Zafar
 unhone jaiming seshan ke dauraan kii puri kahani kaa khulaasa kiya he, jahaan par misha ne yon utpeedan kaa daawa kiya tha
 Allegedly trying to 'kiss', many women accused Ali Zafar, Aksha Ali wrote via a post on social media - i am surprised by Meesha's allegations
 main us concert main kru kaa hissaa thi, main ali jafar ke saath tour par jaati hum
 i have seen many girls lashing out at them, but they respond to them with great respect
 ham ek sahaj vaataaran main kaam karte hai
 So as the stories taking turn every minute regard Ali Zafar, meeshashafi & # metoo movement, i think as a musician and a woman i should talk about this issue as i was SHOCKED 😮 right now with this article of Meesha
 She said that her conscious doesn’t allow her to say quiet so mine also doesn’t allow me
 As i am the part of the concert crew, i travel intl and locally with Ali Zafar, and i have seen girls throwing themselves at him and his gentlemanly response to that which is so rare of any rockstar
 balkay we all travel like friends and we work in a very comfy environment
 Today finally Meesha tells us what she says happened to her that Ali harassed her at a jam or did something wrong to her and i cannot stay quiet
 i was at this jam session becoz i sing in Ali’s band and so was her manager and our entire band
 i am astonished that she would take a lie to this level which so many of us can prove wrong
 We all have pictures, we were there and event manager was there and it was a gr8 jam session
 i am a woman and i would never allow wrong to any woman
 But come on , it's a serious matter and we should be really clear on everything rather then putting accusations on people and then saying sorry you cannot question any woman it’s wrong
 Ali is a genuine person, who treats people around him nicely and has always been a support system for everyone; Accusing some1 is easy but living with the guilt is difficult
 As a woman i felt sad with her rude behaviour towards everyone including the band but more i feel bad that she’s causing disrespect to this Intl movement of women and all of us female musicians and hard working women

 ali) onapr 21, 2018 at 5:21 am PDT She goes on to say, i sing in Ali's band
 mujhe nahin pataa tha ki misha is str tak jhooth bol sakati hai
 We have pictures, we were there, the event manager was there, it was a great jam session
 ek ladki hone ke naate main kisi or ke saath galat nahin hone duungi
 He said, Ali is a good person
 jo apane aasapaas ke logon ko saport karte hai or pyaar se rahete hai
 i am disappointed with Meisha's rude behavior
 pakistani singer ne ali jafar par lagaaya yon shoshan kaa aaropawahin kanja munir kaa kahana he ki main pichley 3 saalon se ali jafar ke saath kaam kar rahi hum
 i was present during that jam session
 mujhe lagata he ki kisi ko bhi apane nijee kaarnon kii vajah se is andolan ko publicity ke liye istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 i have been working with Ali Zafar on and off since the past 3 years or so and up until now I've been quietly observing the current situation because i am no judge of personal character be it Meesha Shafi or Ali Zafar
 However, i stand witness to this particular ‘jam’ late last year that Meesha mentions in her interview with The News
 The whole house band along with myself and another fellow female vocalist were present during this session and whatever interaction took place between the two was in front of at least 10 other people
 All i can say is that this particular statement that she makes here is rather odd
 i have toured with the Ali Zafar band a lot of times and all my trips have been really pleasant and professional and we've spent hours jamming together
 It would be great if this important movement isn’t taken for granted or misused for personal reasons stealing limelight from real causes
