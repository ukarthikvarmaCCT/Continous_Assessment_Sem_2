 With a long convoy of vehicles, Mulayam Singh's nephew Anshul Yadav was filing a nomination for the post of District Panchayat Member (DDC) from Saifai Financial Ward in Etawah's ADM Court

 Before becoming MP on that post, his son Tej Pratap Singh was a resident
 haalanki 1994 main jab saifai dbralock kaa gathan hua tha, tab mridula ke pati ranvir singh yadav pehle block pramukh bane the
 Similarly, Ajanta Singh Yadav, Mulayam's brother-in-law in Etawah, staked his claim for BDC post from ward number 24 of Basrehar block in Etawah

 As a result, outgoing panchayat presidents of these districts have fielded women from their families

 Here, Vijay Laxmi Singh, wife of Minister of State in the SP Government Yogesh Pratap Singh, is the District Panchayat President

 But questions are being raised about reservation for the post of District Panchayat President of Auraiya, Jhansi and Etawah
 pichley chunaav main bhi yah saamaanya varg ke liye arakshit tha or is baar bhi isamen koi badlaav nahin hua he
 Opposition parties have lodged their objection before the State Election Commission questioning the manner of reservation

 Anger also comes on the thought that leaving you or leaving you must have been his well thought out trick
 4
 Taking a sigh of relief Once a feeling of irritation and anger comes out of your mind, you become calm
 ek gahari saans lekar ye sochane lagati hai ki chalovo apane raste or main apane raste
 5

 aapke dimag main har vakt yahi chalata rahata he ki donon saath honge, khush honge
 They must have held each other's hands and are talking affectionately

 johnson ne 28 agast ko sansad ko paanch hafte ke liye nilambit karne kaa aadesh diya tha

 supreme court ke 11 jajon ke faisle ko dete hue supreme court kii adhyaksh brenda haale ne kaha, pradhanmantri kii maharani ko salaah gaiyrkanoonee, nirarthak or aprabhavi thi
 This means that the order to suspend Parliament is illegal, null and ineffective and should be rescinded

 makka kaa utpaadan 1 karod 93 ton ke record utpaadan par pahunchane kii sambhaavna he
 Sowing of pulses has been almost 35 per cent higher this time and that is why the current kharif season is estimated to produce 87 lakh tonnes of pulses, which will be a record production in itself

 vishnu puraana ke anusaar ravivaar, ekadshi, dwadashi, sakranti, surya grahan, chandra grahan tathaa sandhya kaal main tulsi ke pattey nahin todna chahie
 According to belief, in fact, Tulsi Maa observes Ekadashi fast and is therefore not disturbed by breaking
 ekadshi ke din pattey todane se ghar main garibi kaa vaas hota he
 Similarly, on Sunday, it is also forbidden to break basil leaves
 ravivaar vishnu kaa priy waar he
 In such a situation, breaking Tulsi as Lakshmi on this day is like insulting her
 kai jagahon par krur waar hone ke kaaran mangalvaar ko bhi tulsi nahin todate
 Basil leaf should not be broken without taking bath
 shastron ke anusaar yadi koi vyakti bina nahaye hi tulsi ke patton ko todta he to pujan main aise pattey bhagwaan dwaara sweekaar nahin kiye jate hai
 Basil leaves are not considered stale for 11 days
 isaki pattiyon par har roj jal chhidakar pun: bhagwaan ko arpit kiya ja saktaa he
 Shiva, Ganeshji and Bhairavji should not offer basil

 com / tbqxjip0s7 Sudhir Mishra, who is making films like Thousand Khwishais Aisi, Yeh Saali Zindagi and Inkaar, is now returning to the audience with his film Das Das
 ye film 27 april ko relies hogi
 Rahul Bhatt, Richa Chadha and Aditi Rao Hydari will be seen in this film
 sudhir mishra ne apni film ko lekar india today se khaas baatcheet kii
 Question: Did Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's classic attract you
 aap lambey samay se devdas par film banane chaahate the
 It is also said that you wanted to create 'more Devdas', but did not make Dev after becoming D
 Sudhir Mishra: The character of Dev in Devdas has been appealing to me
 lekin ye lavastory se bhi aage he
 This suggests a kind of social structure in which love is impossible
 khaskar us samay kii mahilaon ke liye
 It is true that when Anurag Dev was making D, i was trying to adapt this novel
 lekin tabhi kuch idia mere dimag main aae or sab kuch badal gaya
 i felt close to Shakespeare's Hamlet
 mere dimag main shakespeare ghoomane laga
 i thought why not make my film Chandramukhi Narrate
 shaadi main karan, shweta bachchan ne kiya dance, maa jaya bachchan ne utaari najrasawaal: :ye sahi he ki das dev hi devdas he
 Which is ambitious for power
 aapane becoground main uttar pradesh kii politics lee he
 Why was it appropriate to take this angle? Sudhir Mishra: i always found the politics that affects personal life interesting
 jab mere dimag main ye angel aayaa to maine seriali is bare main sochna shuru kar diya
 If Devdas is the story of Dev, who becomes a slave, it means that he is noble and becomes a victim of addiction
 uske apane paap hai
 In such a situation, it came to my mind that how does Dev protect himself from becoming a slave
 ek aadmi jo pehle sharaab kaa aadi tha phir power kaa aadi hua or kis tarah powerful aadmi dev he
 This story is about love, power and addiction
 haa, ye sahi he ki ye aaj ke dinon kii upi kii politics par he, lekin ye kahin kii bhi politics par ho sakati he
 Karan Johar will dance on this song at Sonam Kapoor's wedding! Question: Prateesh Nandy talked to you about making a remake of 'sahab, Biwi Aur Ghulam'
 lekin ye aap is idia ko aage nahin le gaye
 Why so? Sudhir Mishra: Yes, it is a great film
 jab main is bare main sochataa hum to lagata he ki ye isse behatar kisi anya tarah se nahin ban sakati
 So i leave it
 yadi mujhe laga ki ise kisi or tarah se kiya ja saktaa he to jarur karuunga

 uttarapradesh main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye hone vaale matdaan se pehle apni sabase badi reliyon main se ek ke liye chaar baar mukhyamantri rah chukin mayawati ne saharanpur ko chunaa
 This constituency is one of the areas where the second phase of the assembly will be held on Wednesday
 saharanpur kii jansankhya main 42 pratishat musalmaan hai, 22 pratishat dalit hai - musalamaanon kii taraf mayawati kaa dhyaan bahut zyada he, vahiin loksabhaa chunaav main duuri bana chuke daliton ko bhi is baar vah ganvaana nahin chaahati
 Saharanpur will vote on Wednesday, when western UP will vote for 67 of the state's 403 seats, with elections held for 72 seats last week
 daliton kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaaleen mayawati ke liye yah do charan baaki ke paanch charnon se zyada aasaan hone vaale hai kyonki vah rajya ke pashchimi ilaake main vaise bhi lokapriy hai
 Dalits and Muslims are more in number here
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main jab akhilesh yadav ne badi jeet hasil kii thi, tab mayawati ne saharanpur kii hi saat main chaar kshetron main jeet darj kii thi
 To the south of Saharanpur is Muzaffarnagar where the 2013 riots still remain a burning issue in UP politics
 in dangon main kareeb 60 log maare gaye the jinamein se zyaadaatar musalmaan the or akhilesh yadav par laaparvaahee or kaarywahi main dhilaai kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 To calm the situation, even the army had to be called
 dangon main maare gaye musalamaanon main zyaadaatar pasmanda jati ke the jo dalit yaa pichhadaa varg main aate hai
 Muslims constitute 18% of the population of UP, of which 85% are of Pasmanda caste and most of them are now joining Mayawati's camp
 saharanpur se shuru hui reliyon main mayawati baar baar pasmanda musalamaanon ko yah aashwaasan detii aa rahi hai ki unka gussa daliton kaa bhi gussa he
 Dalits and Muslims together constitute forty percent of up's 200 million population
 mayawati ko ummid he ki utpeedan or jatigat hinsa jaise mudde donon hi shreniyan jhel rahi hai or shaayad is baar mayawati ko iskaa phayda mil sake
 This is his strategy to stay in politics
 haalanki duusari taraf musalamaanon ko akhilesh yadav apane paale main khinchne kii koshish kar rahe hai, or jaisaa ki jagajaahir he ki kis tarah loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke samarthan main daliton ne mayawati se bhi munhmod liya tha
 'in 2014, there was a reflection of economic aspirations in the Dalit votes
 2017 main yah bijli, sadak, pani or usase bhi zyada kanoon or vyavastha jaise muddon ke ird-gird ghoomane vaale hai
 This is said by Ashok Singh, a school teacher in Rampur in western UP
 unka kahana he ki 'dalit ladakiyon kaa har din balaatkaar ho rahaa he lekin hamen exiaar darj karne se roka jaataa he kyonki police thanon par gaiyr daliton kaa raaj he
 But at the same time if something happens to the upper caste girl, then riots happen
 ' ashok kehete hai ki 'modi ji bataur pradhanmantri acha kaam kar rahe hai, lekin unka rajya main koi kaam nahin he
 Behenji will become a better Prime Minister
 ' Mayawati did not get one of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state after PM Modi's appeal for a good day in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ne 72 siten jhatki thim

 While the Jatavs are returning to Mayawati, the BJP is now eyeing non-jatavs, 45% of whom supported the party in 2014
 yahi vajah he ki 85 arakshit siton main se party ne 21 hi jatvon ko di he jabaki unki aabaadi rajya main dalit jansankhya ke aadhe se bhi zyada he
 Moving aside from the Dalit votes, the support of Muslims towards Mayawati is increasing - in 2012 she had 20 percent Muslim votes

 The comments daliton ke saath saath musalamaanon ko bhi apni taraf karne kii koshish main mayawati ko in donon virgon ke bich ke faasale ko mitaanaa hoga
 Violence between Dalits and Muslims has been seen in many surrounding districts for several months after the Muzaffarnagar riots
 aise main inamen se kuch log maanate hai ki aarthik majbootee agenda hona chahie jo ki mayawati ke abhiyaan main nahin dikh rahaa he, vahiin bijepi or akhilesh yadav lagaakaar parivartan or vikaas ko apana ahm vaada banaae hue hai
 Kanwal Bharati, a Dalit writer from Rampur, said - 'mayawati will have to talk about development
 iske saath hi apni raajnneetik shatruon ke khokhalepan ko bhi saamne laana hoga
 For example, the PM launched an app named Bhima for cashless transactions which is named after Ambedkar
 lekin kitne daliton ke paas bank main paisa he? vah unki jagah kisi bhi or netaa kaa naam rakh dete
 If politicians want to add Ambedkar's name to a scheme, then it should be related to education and jobs
 ' For Mayawati, representing Dalits, these two phases are going to be easier than the remaining five because she is popular in the western part of the state anyway
 yahaan daliton or musalamaanon kii sankhya zyada he
 In the last assembly election, when Akhilesh Yadav had won a big victory, Mayawati had won four of the seven constituencies of Saharanpur
 saharanpur ke dakshin main mujffarnagar he jahaan 2013 ke dange abhi bhi upi kii raajnneeti main ek jwalanth mudda bane hue hai
 Around 60 people were killed in these riots, most of them Muslims and Akhilesh Yadav was accused of negligence and laxity in the proceedings
 sthiti ko shant karne ke liye sena tak ko bulaanaa pad gaya tha
 Most of the Muslims killed in the riots were of the Pasmanda caste, who belong to the Dalit or Backward Classes
 upi kii 18 pratishat aabaadi musalamaanon kii he jisamen 85 fisadi pasmanda jati ke hai or inamen se zyaadaatar ab mayawati ke kheme main aa rahe hai
 In rallies started from Saharanpur, Mayawati has been repeatedly assuring the Pasmanda Muslims that their anger is also the anger of the Dalits
 dalit or musalmaan milakar upi kii 20 karod kii jansankhya kaa chalis fisadi hissaa hai
 Mayawati hopes to face both categories of issues like oppression and caste violence and perhaps this time Mayawati can get the benefit
 raajnneeti main tike rahane ke liye yahi unki ranneeti he
 However, on the other hand, Akhilesh Yadav is trying to drag Muslims into his court, and as is well known how Dalits had also backed Mayawati in support of BJP in Lok Sabha elections
 '2014 main dalit voton main aarthik aakankshaon kii parchhaayi najar ai thim
 In 2017, it is going to revolve around issues like electricity, roads, water and even more law and order
 ' aisa ashok singh kaa kahana he jo pashchimi upi ke rampur main skool shikshak hai
 He says that 'dalit girls are being raped every day but we are prevented from registering firs as police stations are ruled by non-dalits
 lekin vahiin agar oonchi jati kii ladki ke saath kuch hota he to dange ho jate hai
 'ashok says that' Modi ji is doing good work as Prime Minister, but he has no work in the state
 bahanji ek behatar pradhanmantri banengi
 ' 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main piem modi ke achche din kii apil ke baad mayawati ko rajya main 80 main se ek bhi loksabhaa seat nahin mili thi
 The BJP had won 72 seats
 khud mayawati kii jatav jati (chamade kaa kaam karne vaale) jo dalit jansankhya kaa 55 pratishat hai, unhone bhi us chunaav main apni netaa se munh pher liya tha
 In 2014, 16 percent of Mayawati's Jatav votes fell to BJP
 lekin is baar aisa nahin hoga
 Deepak, who studies in college, says, 'the Jatavs have thought that they are going to defeat the BJP because this party is anti-dalit
 ' apane saathiyon kii tarah deepak bhi soshal media par sakriy hai or pichley saal rohit vemula kii khudakushi or una dalit pratadna ke maamle ko lekar unhone fasebuk or whatsap par joro shoron se abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 a few weeks ago, RSS propaganda head Manmohan Vaidya had said while speaking on reservation at the Jaipur Literature Festival that there was no benefit in all these years
 aise main is par vichaar kiye jane kii jarurat he
 Mayawati immediately responded by saying that BJP is an upper caste and anti-dalit party
 haalanki aresas ne is par baat main spashtikaran diya tha lekin tab tak mayawati apni baaji chal chuki thim
 Some similar disputes could perhaps thwart the bjp's attempt to attract Dalit votes
 jahaan jatav mayawati kii taraf laut rahe hai, vahiin bijepi kii najar ab gaiyr jatvon par he jinamein se 45 fisadi ne 2014 main party ko samarthan diya tha
 This is the reason that out of 85 reserved seats, the party has given only 21 to Jatavs, while their population is more than half of the Dalit population in the state
 dalit voton se alag hatakar baat karen to mayawati ke prati musalamaanon kaa samarthan badhata ja rahaa he - 2012 main unke paas 20 pratishat muslim vot the
 And behind this support is the big hand of the Pasmanda community
 amir musalamaanon ko abhi bhi sapa bha rahi he
 Khalid Anis Ansari, senior professor at a university in Saharanpur, says that 'upper caste Muslims would prefer to vote for a Hindu OBC candidate than a Pasmanda Muslim
 masalan behaat se bispi ummidavaar haji iqbaal jo pichhadi jati bandkuchi (chidiya pakadaney vaale) se taalluk rakhte hai
 1 in his constituency
 4 lakh musalmaan hai jinamein se mahaz 15 hajaar oonchi jati ke pathan or peerazaade hai lekin iske baavjood vah haji ko vot nahin karenge, bhale hi baaki kaa puraa samudaay use hi vot de
 'BJP can benefit from this difference between rich and poor Muslims over issues and choice of candidates
 tippaniyan In an effort to turn the Dalits as well as Muslims on their side, Mayawati will have to bridge the gap between these two classes
 mujffarnagar dangon ke kai maheenon baad tak aasapaas ke kai jilon main daliton or musalamaanon ke bich hinsa hoti dekhi gai he
 In such a situation, some of these people believe that there should be an economic strengthening agenda which is not seen in Mayawati's campaign, while BJP and Akhilesh Yadav are keeping their promise of change and development in a fix
 rampur ke dalit lekhakar kanaval bharti ne kaha - 'mayawati ko vikaas kii baat kerani hogi
 Along with this, the hollowness of our political enemies will also have to be exposed
 jaise ki piem ne cashlesh lenden ke liye bhim naam kaa ap launch kiya jo ki ambedkar ke naam par liya gaya he
 But how many Dalits have money in the bank? He would have named any other leader in his place
 agar rajanetaaon ko ambedkar kaa naam kisi skim se jodna he to uskaa lenaa dena shiksha or naukariyon se hona chahie
 ' dangon main maare gaye musalamaanon main zyaadaatar pasmanda jati ke the jo dalit yaa pichhadaa varg main aate hai
 Muslims constitute 18% of the population of UP, of which 85% are of Pasmanda caste and most of them are now joining Mayawati's camp

 There is no strong evidence of how cricket started, why it started
 lekin, kintu or parantu ke bich cricket ne apni kismat ke saath-saath kai khilaadiyon kii kismat bhi chamakaayi he
 Cricket was started in England
 england or australia ke bich pehla aupchaarik cricket test match 15 march 1877 ko khelaa gaya tha
 The one-day match began about 94 years after the start of the Test match
 5 janvari 1971 main pehla ek-divasiy match australia or england ke bich melbern ke cricket maidan main khelaa gaya tha
 The Cricket World Cup was started after four years
 pehla cricket worldcup 1975 main england main khelaa gaya tha
 The first match was played between India and England on 7 June 1975 at Lord's ground
 bharat ko ek-divasiy match khilne kaa koi tajurba nahin tha
 India played only two matches before the World Cup match and lost both matches to England
 bharat ke upar kaaphi dabaav tha
 India looked weak in front of a team like England
 worldcup ke pehle match main bharat england se 202 ran se buree tarah se haara gaya tha
 The one-day match was then 60 overs
 england ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue 60 over main 334 ran kaa vishaal score khadaa kiya tha
 But India were able to score just 132 runs for three wickets playing the entire 60 overs
 bharat ke ballebaajon ke paas anubhav na hone ki vajah se bharat kaaphi dhire khelaa tha
 Sunil Gavaskar played very slowly in that match
 gavaskar ne opening karte hue, puure 60 over khele lekin 174 gend kaa saamana karte hue sirf 36 ran banaae the, jisame sirf ek chaukaa shaamil tha
 India did not want to win this match, but wanted to save wickets
 us vaqt puure 60 over khelnaa bharat jaisi team ke liye badi baat thi
 Mohinder Amarnath was the first bowler in World Cup history to set a record for taking the first wicket
 england ke khilaaf is match main amarnath ne jon jemson ko out karke yah kamyaabi hasil kii thi
 Similarly, England batsman Dennis Amis was the first batsman to score a first century at the World Cup
 bharat ke khilaaf is match main denis nen shandaar 137 ran kii pari kheli thi
 India's second match was on 11 June 1975 with a weaker team like east-africa
 east-africa ne pehle batting karte hue 55
 Only 120 runs in 3 overs and all out
 bharat ke saamne bahut bada lakshya nahin tha
 India's openers Sunil Gavaskar and Farooq Engineer put on 29 runs without losing wickets with great batting
 5 over main bharat ko jeet dilaai thi
 Gavaskar was unbeaten on 65 runs and Engineer 54 runs
 gavaskar or ejeeniyar ke ek-divasiy kariyar kaa yah pehla ardhshtak tha
 India played their third match against New Zealand
 pehle ballebaaji karte hue bharat ne newzealand ke saamne 231 ran kaa lakshya rakhaa tha
 New Zealand opener Glenn Turner played a brilliant unbeaten 144 to win New Zealand and India were eliminated from the 1975 World Cup with this defeat
 worldcup itihaas kaa pehla final australia or west-indies ke bich 21 june 1975 ko lords ke maidan par khelaa gaya tha
 Australia had invited the West Indies to bat after winning the toss
 west-indies kii shuruyaat acchhee nahin rahi thi
 The West Indies had lost three wickets for 50 runs, but West Indies captain Clive Lloyd put on a brilliant game, scoring 102 off 85 balls
 west-indies ne puure 60 over khelte hue aath wicket par 291 ran banaae the
 England's team chased down 292 58
 4 over main 274 ran par ol out ho gai or west-indies 17 ran se jeet darj kar pehla worldcup jeetne kaa itihaas rachaa tha
 He received the title of 'man of the Match' due to the brilliant century of West Indies captain Clive Lloyd

 For this, organizations of government employees of all sections and sections are putting their demands before him
 ayog ke adhyaksh ke saamne bahut badi chunauti he ki vah itane saare karmchaariyon ke varg ke bich kaise santulan banaaen

 yah ayog desh ke 36 lakh kendriya karmchaariyon ke liye banaaya gaya he
 Apart from this, pensioners are also included in number of millions

 The police was keeping an eye on the accused teacher without anyone knowing
 police ko hathiyaar lene aane vaale aaropee kaa itanjar tha taaki wo puure gang kaa bhandaphod kar sake
 When after a long time, even when no person came to take arms, the accused teacher started leaving from there

 ye wo chor tha jo palak jhapakate hi vaardaat ko anjaam detaa tha
 The people of Delhi feared this thief
 super chor ke naam se femes is chor kaa naam banty chor he
 Bunty wrote a number of thefts in his name
 ye chor itnaa femes ho gaya tha ki is chor par na sirf film bani
 In reality show too, Bunty Chor went as a contestant
 banty kii chori kii kahaniyaan itani dilachasp hoti thi ki police vaale bhi kaan laga kar uske kisse suna karte the
 Smart in appearance, the fast-paced Super Thief Bunty was so vicious that when he used to come out with dust in the eyes of the front
 isaki unhen khabar tak nahin lagati thi
 This was the reason that there are more than 500 theft cases in the name of this vicious thief
 kai baar police uske kareeb pahunchi, lekin apane nae-nae idia kii madad se wo har baar police ke saamne ikkis hi sabit hua
 After many years of hard work, the thief was finally caught by Delhi Police, after which Delhi Police and Delhiites breathed a sigh of relief
 banty chor to pakadaa gaya, lekin uske karnaamon ne kai or choron ko uski raah par chalane kii sikh bhi de daali
 Even if he is not as vicious as Bunty, but by performing like that, there are definitely a headache for the Delhi Police
 ek aisa hi chor, jo banty kii raah par nikal chukaa he, jiskaa target super chor banty se bhi bada chor banane kaa he, jo ab 100 se zyada vaardaaton ko anjaam de chukaa he
 He claims that he is included in the Top 10 Choro, which is not only impossible to catch, which he learned to steal from Bunty, as well as how to throw the dust in the eyes of the police
 pakade jane par wo aisi beemaari kaa bahaanaa banaata he ki police dar kar use chhod detii he or phir wo ek or vaardaat ko anjaam detaa he

 On the announcement made by BJP President Amit Shah a day before that he ruled for 50 years, he said that only arrogant and autocratic rulers can claim to rule for 50 years without elections
 surajevaala ne kaha ki do vyakti desh kaa loktantr kuchalanaa chaahate hai
 Want to rule for 50 years
 unhone kaha ki bharat,uttar koreanheen he
 Surjewala said that Modi Ji's photo is changed every month at every petrol pump
 uskaa kharchaa har maheene kaa 60 karod rupee kaa he
 On the other hand, the Minister of Petroleum says that we have no way to control the price
 ye sab antarashtriya bazaar ke kaaran ho rahaa he
 Both of his things are lies
 surajevaala ne sawaal kiya ki kai baar exise or custom duty jo badhaai gai, kya wo antarrashtriya kaaran se he?unhone kaha ki kachche tel kii keemat may 2014 main 107 dollar / bairal thi
 Today it is $ 73 / barrel
 yani tel kii keemat nahin badi
 Crude oil became 40% cheaper
 unhone kaha ki modiji kai deshon ko 37 rupee petrol or 34 rupee main dijal bech rahe hai
 Why this double jeopardy? The rupee now going beyond the guiding board, the Congress spokesperson said that the prices of LPG have spoiled the budget of housewives
 52 maheene main gas kaa daam 340 rupye kaise bad gaya? garib aadmi kaa eendhan mitti ke tel kii keemat 14 rupye se 26 rupye ho gaya
 Surjewala pointed out that the rupee fell 72
 87 paise tak pahunch gaya
 The rupee has crossed Modi's age, now it is going beyond the guiding board
 petrol-dijal kii keemat kam hone tak andolnaunhone kaha ki jab tak petrol-dijal ko GST ke andar nahin laayaa jayega, waite kam nahin kiya jayega, tab tak congress kaa andolan chalata rahegaa
 Now the time has come for the farewell of the Modi government

 The girl's death was not due to the shutdown
 Surjewala said that there was no violence anywhere during Bharat Bandh

 He said that Congress workers cannot stop the ambulance

 unhone kaha ki chhattisgarh main petrol par 26
 90 percent is VAT, 25 in Gujarat
 5 or maharashtra main 39

 The result of Hatia assembly by-election has given sleep to Congress and BJP
 ol jharkhand student union (ajasu) party ke naveen jaiswal ne jharkhand vikaas morcha (jhavimo) ke ajay nath sahadev ko 11,000 voton se shikast dekar jeet kaa paracham laharaaya
 While the MP from Ranchi and Tourism Minister Subodh Kant Sahai could not save his younger brother Sunil Sahai from losing the victory
 vah bhi us samay jab unhone tikat ke liye ranchi se lekar dilli tak jamkar rajnatik tikadambaaji kii thi
 Sunil was reduced to 21,578 votes
 hatiya ke un ilaakon se bhi unhen khaas vot nahin mil sake, jinhen unke bade bhaiya kaa garh mana jaataa rahaa he
 The BJP, which has been preparing loudly for the Hatia by-election for the last one year, slipped to third position
 uske pratyaashee ramjilaal sarada ko 26,151 vot mili
 At present, the BJP is happy that not only has Sahay's stature been reduced, but the Congress has slipped to the fourth position
 donon partiyon ke andarkhaane main haar ko lekar koharaam jarur much gaya he
 For the first time since Hatia became an assembly constituency in 1977, a regional party won its seat
 varanaa yahaan se congress yaa phir bhaajapa hi jitati aa rahi thim
 Subodh Kant had been representing Hatia for a long time and later Sarada won this seat thrice, BJP which had lost to Congress in Hatia in the 2005 and 2010 assembly elections, barricaded to win this seat
 Had
 magar rajya bhaajapa or congress ke netritv ko is baat kaa andaja nahin tha ki ajasu is tareeke se unke garh main sendhamari karegi
 Jaiswal, who secured 22,847 votes in the last election, made a dangerous dent in bjp's Vaishya votes including the traditional Muslim vote of the Congress and the urban vote bank of these two parties
 vot main hui sendhamari or haar ko lekar congress or bhaajapa main alag-alag tark die ja rahe hai lekin jaiswal ne apane jeet ke kaarnon ko bahut hi spasht or sidhaa bataaya
 He says, "I was working continuously since the last time i lost
" vah kisi urjawan ko jitaana chaahate the jo badlaav laa sake
 The youth was with us, this was our issue as well
 ''ajasu party ke mukhiya or rajya ke up-mukhyamantri sudesh kumaar mahato ne hatiya ke madhyam se yah sanket to de hi diya he ki 2014 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main party apni sankhya ko badhaane kii disha main agrasar he
 He says, "it was an experiment for us that was very rewarding
" ''bhaajapa ne jahaan kamjor ummidavaar khadaa kiya vahiin congress ne ek nausikhiye ko tikat diya jinaki ekmaatr jamaapunji unke bhai kaa kendriya mantri hona thi
 Due to this, the reputation of Subodh Kant has been discounted, his critics in the party have come out on the verbal war
 congress kii naaraaz netaa pratibha pandeya ne to party hi chhod di
 The discord in the party over Sunil's candidature rose to such a level that his defeat was projected as Subodh Kant's personal defeat
 ekta dikhaane kii purajor koshishon ke baavjood bhaajapa main bhi andruni kalah or khinchataan saaf najar ai
 Two party leaders gave two different reasons for the defeat
 pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh dineshanand goswami safai dete hai, ''shahari votaron kaa nahin nikalnaa hamaari haar kaa kaaran bana
 Our star campaigner Arjun Munda also opted out of publicity due to health reasons
 sabase badi baat yah ki chunaav ke dauraan ham ajasu par behatar tareeke se hamalaa nahin kar paae
 "sarada cites another reason for the defeat," i got full support from the central leadership, but at the state level i felt a lack of coordination
 ''agar hatiya kaa janadesh arjuna munda sarkaar ke khilaaf nahin tha to yah kam se kam in do rashtriya partiyon ke khilaaf logon ke gusse kaa izhaar jarur tha
 Ironically, the defeat for the BJP did not stop, which started with the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha by-election
 lagata he ki ajasu or jhavimo jharkhand kii aagaamee raajnneeti kii disha tay karenge
 BJP and Congress may not believe this, but they understand this truth
 jis sadan ko raajnneeti main ucch aadarshon vaala mana gaya or uske gathan kii manshaa yahi thi ki yah chun kar aae logon ke sadan se alag janadbaav se upar uth kar nitiyon par vichaar karegaa, us sadan kaa chunaav aam chunaavon kii tarah hi aniatik or lut paat ke qisson se bharaa hua he

 Immorality is the morality of politics
 jo log naitikta ke plateform se raajnneeti ko dekhte hai, wo har daur main or har party se thage jane ke liye abhishpt hai
 The election of Rajya Sabha was again reminded that ideological and constitutional ethics are nothing
 har baar yaad dilaataa he or har baar janata bhul jaati he
 The public knows everything that is why they forget because the public always views morality from a practical point of view

 uske paas nafrat kii raajnneeti main ghus kar bahes karne kaa athaah dhiraj he magar aniatikta kii paraton ko hataakar dekhne kii beqaraari nahin he
 The election of Rajya Sabha suggests that our democracy is trapped in a gang of political parties
 sampradayikta kii ladaai sirf garib hindu-musalmaan ke liye he
 He fights against it and he is killed

 jaat birdari ke naam par netaa bane logon ko pataa he ki vichaardhaara do kaudi kii cheez he
 Investigations are going on against Hooda, yet opposing candidates were hesitant while taking votes from him
 hooda ne is vot ke badale kya sauda kiya hoga
 To whom did Congress support? RK Anand anand inelo kaa samarthan hone kaa daawa kar rahe the jiske netaa ko hooda ne hi jail bhijwaya
 The man was calling for secularism in the Congress office
 hooda ne apni nirpekshata kaa dharm sabit kar diya! What did Congress do in Karnataka? What moral reasons should JDS mlas leave their party and have an affection for Congress? What else if no money? Everyone knows which game the BJP played by taking out independent candidates
 nirdaleey ummidavaar paise vaale hi kyon utaare gaye? jharkhand main vidhayakon ke khilaaf warrant nikalava kar matdaan karne se roka gaya
 Like the Congress BJP, their workers in other parties kept on sweating, but in the name of saving their leaders, a gang of lawyers from Delhi took the Rajya Sabha seat
 bhartiya raajnneeti main nayaa nahin ghat rahaa he
 In the name of Naya, new leaders come to some place, but now these parties are rusted
 nae-nae dalon kii paidaaish hamaare loktantr ke liye bahut zaruri he

 They are coming from so many times, they all meet each other
 sab ek jaise ho gaye hai
 The Rajya Sabha elections have tried to remind for a while that the colors of the flags are different in Indian politics, but all those carrying them are the same
 tippaniyan This entire crisis is a burden for those who see all the parties on the scale of ideal and morality
 samarthan karte hai
 There is no need for any party, but these people are a moral crisis for all parties
 isliye inke khilaaf sab ho jate hai
 The public lives without moral crisis
 kab se lokapal kaa kanoon paas he
 Is there any struggle to bring Lokpal? After distributing this certificate, corruption was erased, was the election of Rajya Sabha free from corruption? mujhe pataa he vidhayak padhakar hansenge ki ye abhi bhi janata ke sahare naitikta kaa aahvaan kar rahaa he
 Haha, of course not
 mujhe pataa he jis giroh ke sardaar ye khel rachate hai, wo giroh pehle janata se hi banataa he
 Those who are suffering morality have a suggestion
 kisi na kisi ke andh samarthak ho jaaen
 This will neither cause them moral crisis nor ideology
 rajyasabha ke chunaav ko bhul janaa behatar he
 This is the message of all political parties
 bharat duniya kaa sabase bada loktantr he
 Chanting this mantra day and night will end the anguish of the mind and sleep will be good
 jo naitik nahin hai, wo loktantr main mantra kaa jaap na karen, note ginen note

 Politics is a business and everybody is a businessman in this business
 munaafaa jiskaa dharm he
 Congress mlas have proved that they like to sell more than ideology
 haryana congress ke netaaon ne kalam kaa jo bahaanaa pesh kiya he, us par dhyaan dene se koi laabh nahin
 They should be sent in Natraj pencil gifts
 pencil se to likhni aati hogi! ajit jogi ko hansi aa rahi hogi ki ve baghaavat kar congress se baahar hai or ye baghaavat kar congress ke bheetar hai
 Rebellion's two in one radio is the discovery of Congress

 Investigations are going on against Hooda, yet opposing candidates were hesitant while taking votes from him
 hooda ne is vot ke badale kya sauda kiya hoga
 To whom did Congress support? RK Anand anand inelo kaa samarthan hone kaa daawa kar rahe the jiske netaa ko hooda ne hi jail bhijwaya
 The man was calling for secularism in the Congress office
 hooda ne apni nirpekshata kaa dharm sabit kar diya! What did Congress do in Karnataka? What moral reasons should JDS mlas leave their party and have an affection for Congress? What else if no money? Everyone knows which game the BJP played by taking out independent candidates
 nirdaleey ummidavaar paise vaale hi kyon utaare gaye? jharkhand main vidhayakon ke khilaaf warrant nikalava kar matdaan karne se roka gaya
 Like the Congress BJP, their workers in other parties kept on sweating, but in the name of saving their leaders, a gang of lawyers from Delhi took the Rajya Sabha seat
 bhartiya raajnneeti main nayaa nahin ghat rahaa he
 In the name of Naya, new leaders come to some place, but now these parties are rusted

 Haha, of course not
 mujhe pataa he jis giroh ke sardaar ye khel rachate hai, wo giroh pehle janata se hi banataa he
 Those who are suffering morality have a suggestion

 He has the extreme endurance to enter into the politics of hate and argue, but there is no way to remove the layers of immorality

 dilli ensiaar main is saal diwaali par pataakhon kii bikri par supreme court ne roak laga di he
 In its latest order, the Supreme Court has ordered suspension of all permanent and temporary licenses in Delhi till 1 November
 supreme court ke is aadesh kaa matlab he ki rashtriya rajdhani main pataakhaa kaarobaari ek november ke baad pataakhe bech sakate hai
 Firecrackers are deeply disappointed by this decision of the Supreme Court
 sadar bazaar pataakhaa association ke adhyaksh narendra gupta ke mutabik, "supreme court ke is faisle se ham kaaphi niraash hai
 This is an injustice to us
 agar pataakhon kii bikri par puri tarah bain karnaa hi tha to 12 sitambar 2017 ke aadesh main bain ko kyon hataaya
 Now we have filled millions of goods
 bikri nahin hogi to ise lekar ab kahaan jaaen
 We will lose millions
 "supreme court kaa you-turngauratlab he ki pichle saal diwaali ke baad bade hue pradooshan ke mudde par ek yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne dilli-ensiaar main pataakhe kii bikri par bain laga diya tha
 However, on 12 September 2017, the Supreme Court amended the ban on the sale of firecrackers and ordered a 50 per cent reduction in the number of temporary licenses of firecrackers with certain conditions
 saath hi dilli-ensiaar main duusare rajyon se pataakhe laane par bhi pratibandh laga diya tha
 But on Monday, the Supreme Court once again restored the old order of November 2016 and ordered a complete ban on the sale of firecrackers in delhi-ncr
 kaarobaariyon main naarazgisupreme court ke pichley aadesh ko dekhte hue sadar bazaar main sirf 24 asthaayee dukaanon ko pataakhe bechney kaa license diya gaya tha
 But now there is resentment among the temporary cracker traders following the latest Supreme Court order
 sadar bazaar main chhabda ji pataakhaa dukaan ke harjit singh chhabda ke mutabik, "yah saraasar galat he
 We had got a temporary license on the 15 meter distance clause
 kareeb 24 kaarobaariyon ko 12 sitambar ke aadesh ke baad asthaayee license mila tha, jo 21 oktober tak vaid he
 Now we are hearing today that we cannot sell
 to yah hamaare saath anyaay hua
 If it was to be banned, then why was it removed? ham ladiyon kii dukaan laga lete, kuch or kar lete, ab sara paisa funs gaya
 "not only selective businessmen will become thousands of unemployed crackers, if the whole Supreme Court's decision will not only harm the crackers, but thousands of people will become unemployed
 court ke faisle se niraash kaarobaariyon ne kaha ki ham chaahate hai court kam se kam un kaarobaariyon ko raahat de, jinhone 12 sitambar ke aadesh ke baad apni dukaanon main pataakhon kaa stock bhar liya he
 Permit to sell them crackers
 "kaarobaariyon kaa kahana he ki ek navambar ke baad sirf vahi log pataakhe kharidte hai, jinke ghar shaadi yaa koi samaaroh ho
 Crackers have also warned of a protest in the absence of a solution

 CAT National President BC Bharatia and National General Secretary Pravin Khandelwal said that the Supreme Court has imposed a ban on selling firecrackers, but not giving up firecrackers and taking advantage of this, people can buy firecrackers here from other states besides Delhi
 unka kahana he ki yadi aisa hota he to yah dilli ke vyapaariyon ke saath anyaay hoga, kyonki unka vyapaar anya rajyon main chalaa jayega, jo nyaay kii drushti se uchit nahin he
 Even non-harmful firecrackers will not be released to the environment
 Kat says that Delhi NCR also has a large amount of non-harmful firecrackers, but due to the latest order of the Supreme Court, such non-harmful firecrackers also cannot be sold
 Will be able to bahut se vyapaariyon ne is diwali ke liye pataakhon kaa stock ab tak manga liya he, lekin achaanak pratibandh lagane se un vyapaariyon ko badi vittiya haani honi tay he
 CAT says that harm to the environment is not just from firecrackers, so a policy should be made about the environment and the government should file a review petition in the Supreme Court and urge it to withdraw the ban for at least this Diwali
