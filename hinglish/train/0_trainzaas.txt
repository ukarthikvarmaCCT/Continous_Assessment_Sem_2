 a series of scams such as the Commonwealth Games to the coal scam or the massive loss to the exchequer in the 2G telecom spectrum allocation forced people to demand action against corruption
 log keval itnaa hi nahin chaahate the ki koi aisa ho jo desh chalaa sake balki ek aisa netaa jo rajkaaj ke bhrasht or aniatik tantra ko saaf bhi kar sake
 Modi came to power riding on this promise
 satta main rahete hue teen saal ke baad unhone yah tay kiya he ki ve bhrashtachar or kaale dhan kii jadon par hamalaa karne ke tamaam upaay karen
 More importantly, they have managed to reach the voters why they are doing it
 isiilie notebandi ke charam daur main jab log apana hi paisa nikaalane ke liye sarpili kataron main bainkon ke saamne khadey the, modi dukh to jaahir kar rahe the lekin logon ko baar-baar yaad dilaa rahe the ki ve aisa kyon kar rahe hai
 He assured that demonetisation is a parity-making step and now it is the turn of those who made money wrongly
 unhone ehsaas dilaayaa ki sarkaar janata kii maang par hi svachh sarkaar kii disha main kaam kar rahi he or avaidh tareeke se dhan sanchay karne waalon par kadi karrwai kar rahi he
 Even the second major and important reform of his government, GST, was not introduced in this form alone, which would help consumers by lowering prices, but would also help in reducing tax evasion and bribery
 in tamaam kavayadon main modi ''kyon" par jor die hue the, ''kya" or ''kaise" par nahin
 With this, he managed to explain his story to the people
 kuch or gun hai jo modi ne pradarshit kiye hai or jinke chalate unki chhavi jabardast oonchaaiyon par pahunch gai he
 The Prime Minister has now been ranked as the best leader since independence
 ve jawaharlal nehru, indira gandhi or atalbihari vaajapeyi se bhi tazatreen desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main aage nikal chuke hai
 The condition of his government is that if elections are held today, the NDA will be able to win 349 seats, which is slightly less than 360 of the previous country's mood survey conducted in January 2017
 upie 75 siton ke saath bahut peeche he jabaki anya vipakshi dalon ko bamushkil 119 siten aaengi
 It is also important that the mood of another country in the third survey has revealed that the BJP can single-handedly get a majority
 maujuuda surveykshan main use 298 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 If the BJP and Modi are able to stand on their own today, despite the decline in the economic growth due to demonetisation, then this fact indicates that the ruling party is capable enough to return to power in 2019, provided the current trend Be continued ye nattejey bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke mahagathbandhan se tuutakar endie main vaapasi se pehle ke hai
 If his party joins the JD (U) alliance, then the NDA figure could cross 400 seats in the current scenario
 modi ko samajhane ke liye ek baar phir sinek kaa sahaara lete hai, jo jabardast kamyaabi ke 10 sutara ginate haih niyam todo, apane dimag ko prashikshit karo, dhairya rakho, javabdeh bano, apni kshamta se zyada karo, khunta pakade raho, ant main bolo, pramanik raho, apni chittavriti ko talasho or kyon se shuruyaat karo
 Check this list and you will find that Modi follows every formula
 unhone lagaataar niyamon ko todaa he, chaahe vah sargical hamalaa ho yaa notebandi
 In the last three years, he has consistently left his rivals and himself behind with his work
 ve apane har kadam kii javabdehi lete hai
 They listen to their colleagues in cabinet meetings and finally speak
 or jab kabhi bolte hai, usamen spashtataa, junun or pramanikta hoti he jo hameshaa vyapak drushti ko rekhaankit karti he
 Perhaps this is the reason that in the mood survey of the country 63 per cent people are describing their performance from good to great and only 12 per cent are calling it bad and worse
 baavjood iske sinek ke niyam yah nahin bataa pate ki aakhir teen saal ke baad bhi modi ke chakkar main bharat kaise fansaa padaa he
 One reason is that Modi is seen as a strong and decisive leader who is keen to realize the vision of modern India by which he wants to inspire the people
 aisa karne main unhone nijee udhaaharan ko saamne rakhaa he or yah sunishchit kiya he ki kendriya naukarshahon kii niyukti main yogyata ko tarjeeh di jaati he
 They are practical administrators and supervise their programs themselves and get power point presentations from their ministers and officers regarding their progress
 unki cabinet ke sahyogiyon kaa kahana he ki pradhanmantri kii yaaddaasht jabardast he, ve ek achche shrota hai or maheen vivaranon par unki nigaah rahati he
 As one colleague says, "they see themselves from the stage of fabrication of ideas to the stage of narrative making and implementation
" " modi ne rajkaaj ko sakasham banane tathaa sarkari prakriyaaon ko saral karne or gati dene ke liye praudyogiki kaa dohan kiya he
 In order to spread his message to the people, he has taken the help of ongoing jumals and proverbs
 sansad main ''bharat chodo" andolan kii 75veen saalagirah ke maukey par modi ne kaha ki prasiddh naaraa ''karenge yaa marenge" ko badalakar ''karenge or kar ke rahenge" kar dena chahie
 In the Independence Day address, people have been suggested, they should leave the "moves" and adopt "can change" vision
 kaam karne kii style kii baat aati he to desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan ke nattejey kaaphi dilachasp or virodhabhasi dikhte hai
 They top the list of big risk takers without fear (24 per cent of people) but one result of the survey is giving them a stern warning
 itani hi sankhya un logon kii bhi he jo maanate hai ki modi keval baat karte hai or kaam kuch nahin karte
 The point is that all the schemes that he has started, after three years, start doing something on them, now start appearing
 ek tabaka aisa he jo maanata he ki pradhanmantri panth-sankeern or alpsankhyak-virdohi hai
 The guards have taken the law into their hands and added to this image
 aise tatwon ke saath kathorta kaa bartaav karnaa hoga
 Modi had recently given a strong message against the violence committed by him
 swatantraaa diwas ke sambodhan main bhi is bare main khulkar baat kii
 Those surveyed accept his pro-poor image, but people take him lightly in relation to farmers' schemes and say that these schemes are insufficient
 is surveykshan se kuch or sanket nikle hai jo pradhanmantri ke liye chetavanee swaroop hai
 The most important warning is coming on the employment front, where people are aware that the job crisis has increased since the last country mood survey (see accompanying story on the economy)
 aisa nahin he ki modi sarkaar ne bilkul hi kuch bhi nahin kiya
 His emphasis has been on increasing government expenditure on infrastructure, especially in the labor intensive roads and housing sector
 aane vaale saal main in sabakaa phayda unhen mil saktaa he
 Apart from this, he has launched many more development plans
 pradhanmantri ne berozegaar yuvaaon se rojgaar khojane kii bajaae rojgaar paidaa karne kaa aahvaan karke puri kahani ko hi palat diya he
 They say that they should fully exploit the self-employment schemes that their government has started
 pradhanmantri modi pair failaane main koi sankoch nahin karte, chadar chaahe kitni hi choti ho
 He has caught a new target
 unhone ''new india" ke vijan ko spasht kar diya he jise 2022 tak praapt kar liya janaa he- tab jabaki bharat apni aazaadee ke 75 saal puure karegaa
 In his Independence Day speech, he said, "I call on Team India to race to build New India by 2022
 us samay tak garibon ke paas kancreet ke pakke ghar honge
 Farmers' income would have doubled
 yuvaaon or mahilaon ke paas dher saare samruddhi ke avasar honge
 He should be a clean India
 jatvaad, sampradayikta, bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad se mukt bharat
 "by saying this, Modi has conveyed to the voters in a very subtle way that his eyes are not on the 2019 elections when he will have to contest again
 iske bajaae martin luther king kii tarj par unhone 2022 kaa ek khaakaa pesh kiya he jo logon ko unhen satta main waapas laane kii vajah muhaiyaa karaata he
 Management majors should take a lesson from Modi

 Standing Committee Chairman, North MCD, Tilak Raj Kataria, accused the Delhi government that when the MCD was not bifurcated, the unified MCD had identified 351 roads in the year 2007 and 2009 and these places were used for commercial and mixed land use
 The Government of Delhi was sent to notify
 jise dilli sarkaar ne ab tak adhishuchet nahin kiya he
 Kataria alleged that on going to file notification to Delhi government, people started commercial activities on these roads due to the possibility of being notified, but due to non-notification of these roads by Delhi government so far But the ceiling of the ceiling is hanging
 is vajah se iske liye puri tarah dilli sarkaar hi jimmedaar he
 Accusing the Aam Aadmi Party and Congress councilors in the MCD, Kataria said that both political parties are not serious and sensitive on this

 Kataria alleged that if the Delhi government had notified 351 roads on time, the traders could have submitted conversion charges

 Teacher Uttara Bahuguna, who was replying to Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in the Janata Darbar, has been suspended and sent to the Education Officer Office, Naogaon
 praarambhik jila shiksha adhikari kees chouhan ne nilamban aadesh main kaha he ki unke dwaara mukhyamantri ke janata darbar main bina vibhageeya adhikari ke pratibhaag kiya or vahaan par abhadrata kii gai he, jo karmchaaree aachaar seva ke niyam kaa ulanghan he
 But the big officers who have violated the rules and the Chief Minister himself are probably not aware of the right things, if it were, then perhaps a 57-year-old widow teacher would not have to leave her officers and come directly to the Janata court
 aakhir usamen itani himmat kahaan se ai ki wo mukhyamantri se sidhe is tarah se mukhaatib ho baithi
 The Chief Minister had been fighting the system for 25 years, even though the Chief Minister may not have thought, but till today the team went to the bottom of the truth and investigated the right reasons, it was found that this teacher was fighting the system for the last 25 years, but no Due to lack of access, no one heard nor took any action
 aakhirkaar mukhyamantri ke darbar main jab karrwai hui to itani khatarnaak karrwai hui ki sabake hosh ud gaye
 Chief Trivendra Singh Rawat ordered the female teacher suspended and arrested
 shaayad ise hi mukhiya kaa janata darbar kehete hai
 These are the truth-telling figures Uttara Pant Bahuguna was first appointed in 1993 in the inaccessible school of the Government Primary School, Bhadrasu Mori Uttarkashi
 agle saal unhen uttarkashi main hi chinyalisod ke dhuniyaara praathmik vidhyalay main transfar kar diya gaya
 Which is 5-6 km by road
 kii khadi chadhaai par sthapit he
 She was posted at Jagadgaon Dugulagad for seven-eight years from 1994 and after being posted here from 2003 to 2015 she was shifted to Jestwadi Primary School in Naugaon, Uttarkashi
 varsh 2015 main pati kii mrityu hone ke baad adhyapika lagaataar bacchon ke saath dehradun transfar ke liye prayaas kar rahi thi, lekin tatkaaleen mukhyamantri ramesh pokharial nishank, vijay bahuguna, harish ravat se lekar trivendra singh ravat tak ne unki kuch nahin suni
 The CM had given the assurance of transfer
 The woman teacher who failed in the court itself was helpless that she could not stop herself in front of Trivendra Singh Rawat and got such a huge punishment
 adhyapika kuch din pehle bhi trivendra singh ravat se mili thim
 CM Rawat had also assured him to transfer but this did not happen
 artiai se hua ye khulaasis maamle main ek sachai or nikalakar saamne ai jise aamajan ke saamne laane main ek artiai kaa bahut bada yogadan he
 According to documents available in RTI, Sunita Rawat, wife of Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, has been posted in Sugam since his first appointment
 sunita ravat kii pratham niyukti 24 march 1992 ko praathmik vidhyalay kafaldi swit paudi gadhwal main hui thi
 It is an accessible school
 16 / 7 / 1992 se vah chaar saal praathmik vidhyalay mandoli paudi gadhwal main raheen or phir 27 / 8 / 1996 ko unka transfar praathmik vidhyalay ajabpur kalam main hua to phir kabhi unhone yahaan se baahar kaa munh nahin dekha
 He was promoted on 24 / 5 / 2008 in the former Secondary School Ajabpur Kalan and since then his posting is the same
 AN RTI query reveals that # uttarakhandcm TS Rawat's wife Sunita Rawat is posted in a school in Dehradun's Ajabpur Kalan since 1996 even after she received promotion in 2008

 com / yytfmnpxlh— ANI (@ani)june 29, 2018do adhyapikaon ke liye alag-alag niyam kyon?soochna ke adhikaar main lok soochna adhikari tathaa upashiksha adhikari monica bam ne ek artiai ke jawaab main bataaya ki sunita ravat kii niyukti patr ke alaava anya pramaan patr unke paas uplabdh nahin hai
 The school is located in Dehradun, Raipur Block
 yadi in donon adhyapikaon kii tulana kii jaae to ek adhyapika 1993 se uttarkashi ke durgam main he, or varsh 2015 main vidhwaa ho gai thi, jabaki duusari adhyapika 1992 main apni tainaati ke baad se lagaataar sugam main he or 1996 se dehradun main ek hi jagah par tainaat he
 After all, when both the teachers are teachers of primary schools, then why are there two different rules for both? CM Rawat's behavior towards female teacher is a misconception that even the Chief Minister does not have the answer, but the misery of a widow teacher near retirement And instead of two words of sympathy for outrage, if the Chief Minister flares up the arrogance of power in this way, then the justification of the Janata Darbar What will be left? Trivendra Singh Rawat got the key to power because of his honest image, his strictness is also necessary but his strictness on a woman cannot be considered right in any way
 shabdon ke prayog main mahila shikshika ko bhi sahi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa lekin mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat kii bhashaa or vyavhaar ko bhi sahi tehraana galat hoga

 prakaashak ne bataaya kitni mushkil hui kitaab likhane menvenkat ne sunai gond kalakaaron ke dikkat kii kahanisahitya ajtak ke manch par lekhak, prakaashak or patrkaar es
 Anand told that this book (ganja-mahua Chronicles) is on the story of Venkat Raman Singh Shyam
 ye gond kalakaar hai
 Gond culture was carried forward in his family
 is kitaab main venkat ke jivan kii har kahani he
 Once Venkata came to my office and said that you write biography
 baba sahib ambedkar kii jeevani likhte hai
 Write me too venkat ne bataaya ki chitra kii bhashaa nahin hoti
 Anand has read me
 maine unhen padhaayaa he
 We walked along the wheels of the rail
 ham saal bhar tak ye soch nahin paa rahe the painting or sangeet ko ekasaath kaise lekar chale
 The story in Ganja Mahua Chronicles is that these two should not coexist
 hamane do logon kii jeevani ko jodakar kahani banaai he
 Venkat told that when Anand met me in Bengaluru and came back, he told Anand's wife that you always see Venkat
 badi mushkil ho rahi thi
 My life was divided into two parts
 bifor venkat or after venkat
 In this book there is a journey from Venkat's floor to Arsh
 venkat ne bataaya adivasee samskruti main logon ke swaagat main kaha jaataa he johaar
 After this Venkat Raman Singh Shyam narrated the Karama song
 unke saath es
 Anand was also humming
 anand ne bataaya ki maine jab venkat ke saath kuch samay bataaya to pataa chalaa ki wo ram bhakt hai
 Ram is not a devotee
 wo tab tak apni kahani nahin sunaate the, jab tak unke andar kuch (ram) daalaa nahin jaataa tha
 All the colors in Venkat's story are full
 ise koi bhi pard saktaa he
 s
 anand ne bataaya ki venkat ne mujhase kabhi kuch nahin chipaaya
 They are an integral part of my life
 phir venkat ne bataaya ki mere bachapan main mujhe khilone nahin milte the
 i wanted a spin and my father made me spin
 tab kharid nahin sakate the
 Venkat told that it was only after Anand's arrival that my life changed a lot
 venkat ne bataaya ki japan main jab mere chachaa kii maut ho jaati he to unke shav ko bharat laane ke liye hamane mukhyamantri se lekar bade-bade logon se sampark karnaa padataa tha
 My uncle was the world's biggest Gond artist
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri pad kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa ke dauraan bhopal sthit congress daftar main logon ke hujum main jyotiraditya sindhiya thode khoe-khoe se najar aae
 He thought he might be missing something
 mukhyamantri koun banegaa, is sawaal ko lekar guuruuvaar ko dinabhar dilli main rahul gandhi ke ghar par marathon baithkon kaa daur chalata rahaa
 The president of Madhya Pradesh Congress, Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya, considered close to the Gandhi family, were contenders for the post of Chief Minister
 dinabhar kii maathapai ke baad siem ke naam kaa der raat elaan hua or ek baar phir sindhiya parivaar rajya kaa mukhiya banane se chook gaya
 Kamal Nath's name was stamped, while Jyotiraditya had to step back
 yah pehali dfa nahin he, jab madhya pradesh main mukhyamantri kii kursi sindhiya parivaar ke haath se fisali he
 Jyotiraditya's father Madhavrao Scindia was convinced that he would be made the CM after the victory of the Congress after the 1993 state assembly elections
 magar mukhyamantri kii kursi ek aise shaks ko mili jisaki kisi ko ummid nahin thi
 The story of becoming the Chief Minister is interesting, the story of becoming the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh at that time is interesting
 kaha jaataa he ki digvijay singh mukhyamantri ban gaye or madhavrao sindhiya dilli main helicopter taiyaar kar phone aane kaa intjaar karte rahe
 Actually, Madhya Pradesh came under President's rule after the Babri Masjid demolition
 digvijay singh us samay pradesh ke congress adhyaksh the
 When the Assembly elections were held in November 1993, the Congress won unexpectedly
 is jeet ke baad mukhyamantri banane kii daud main shyama charan shukla, madhavrao sindhiya or subhash yadav jaise netaa shaamil ho gaye
 The funny thing is that Digvijay Singh was an MP at that time and did not contest assembly elections
 kaha to yah bhi jaataa he ki madhavrao ko rokane ke liye arjuna singh or digvijay singh ne swang rachaa tha
 However, there is no evidence of this
 raajnneetik vishleshak gauri shankar rajhans bataate hai ki digvijay ko shyama charan shukla raajnneeti main lekar aae or arjuna singh ne unhen pehali baar mantri banaaya or donon ke saath dibba khulaa to digvijay singh mukhyamantri ban gaye
 The meeting of the legislature party started in the midst of heavy competition in which the Chief Minister was to be elected
 varisht patrkaar or raajnneetik vishleshak enke singh kii maane to arjuna singh ne pichhadaa varg se mukhyamantri banane kii vakaalat karte hue subhash yadav kaa naam aage badha diya
 Seeing that there was no consensus on Subhash's name in the meeting, Arjun Singh accepted his defeat and went out after finishing his speech
 is dauraan madhav raav sindhiya dilli main helicopter ke saath phone aane kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 He was told that as soon as the news is given, Bhopal will come immediately
 shyamacharan or subhash yadav ke mukhyamantri na banane par arjuna singh apane vidhayakon kaa samarthan madhavrao ko de denge
 The trial was going on in the meeting
 kendriya paryvekshak ke taur par vahaan pranab mukherjee, susheel kumaar scindia or janardan pujari maujuud the
 When the controversy escalated, Pranab Mukherjee conducted a secret ballot in which 56 out of 174 mlas expressed their opinion in favor of Shyamacharan
 jabaki 100 se zyada vidhayakon ne digvijay ke paksh main matdaan kiya tha
 After the result, Kamal Nath ran towards the room where the only telephone of the entire building was on
 kamalnath ne vahaan se dilli kisi ko phone kiya
 The then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao from Delhi told Pranab Mukherjee on phone that the mlas who voted the most in favor should be made the Chief Minister
 is puure naatakeey ghatnakram ke baad digvijay singh mukhyamantri ban gaye or madhavrao phone kaa intjaar hi karte rahe
 The validity of Section 377 of the IPC, which criminalises homosexual sex by mutual consent, was challenged in the Supreme Court
 isse sambandhit yachikaaon par supreme court ne faisla suna diya he
 Homosexual relationships will no longer be a crime in India
 beeti 17 july ko supreme court ne 4 din kii sunwaayee ke baad is maamle main faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 This matter is in discussion these days
 aise main kai log ipisi kidhara 377ke bare main jaananaa chaahate hai
 Section 377 defines unnatural sex as a crime
 is dhara ke mutabik jo koi bhi prakruti kii vyavastha ke vipareet kisi purush, mahila yaa pashu ke saath younachaar karata he, use umrakaid yaa das saal tak kii kaid or jurmaane kii sajaa ho sakati he
 What is Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) of the IPC, homosexuality is considered a crime
 ipisi kii dhara 377 ke mutabik jo koi bhi kisi purush, mahila yaa pashu ke saath prakruti kii vyavastha ke khilaaf sex karata he, to is aparaadh ke liye use 10 varsh kii sajaa yaa aaajeevan karawas se dandit kiye jane kaa praavdhaan he
 He will also be fined
 yah aparaadh sangyeya aparaadh kii shrenee main aata he or yah gaiyr jamaanti bhi he
 Laws on Unnatural Sex In the year 1290, the first case of unnatural sex was reported in the Fleta area of england, which was made a law and classified as a crime
 yah is tarah kaa pehla maamla tha
 After this, the Bagri Act was enacted in 1533 in Britain and England regarding unnatural relations
 jiske tahat faansee kaa praavdhaan tha
 It was re-implemented by Queen elizabeth-i in 1563
 1817 main bagari act se oral sex ko hataa diya gaya
 377 Dharsana in India In 1860, the then British Government included Section 377 in the Indian Penal Code and it was implemented in India at that time
 1861 main deth penalty kaa praavdhaan bhi hataa diya gaya
 In 1861, when Lord Macaulay drafted the Indian Penal Code i
e
 IPC, there was a provision of section 377 for this offense
 LGBTQ samudaay ne kii 377 hataane kii maangalighbhthyan samudaay ke tahatalesbian, ge, bisexual, transgenter or quyr aate hai
 For a long time this community has been demanding that they be given their rights and Section 377 should be made illegal
 niztaa kaa adhikaar par supreme court ke faisle ke baad is samudaay ne apni maangon ko phir se tej kar diya tha
 Under this, several petitions were simultaneously pending in the Supreme Court
 jin par 4 din kii sunwaayee ke baad 17 july ko supreme court ne faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 No homosexual sex in these countries: Australia, Malta, Germany, Finland, Colombia, Ireland, USA, Greenland, Scotland, Luxembourg, England and Wales, Brazil, France, New Zealand, Uruguay, Denmark, Argentina, Portugal, Iceland, Sweden, Norway , 26 countries such as South Africa, Spain, Canada, Belgium, Netherlands have excluded gay sex from the category of crime

 "there was a meeting with David Dhawan, Govinda said," i was told by Sanjay Dutt that Punjabi is coming
 us samay jitne bhi punjabi kahaan kahaan se aate the to main unhen kaam de diya karata tha
 David Dhawan also came from them
 wo mujhe achche lage, mujhe laga ki inke saath bahut sari hit filmein de saktaa hum

 My brother is a director, so far i have not been able to do 17 films with him
 ab ye kya apeksha kar rahe hai, mujhe nahin pataa
 At the time when i had done 17 films with him, i told him the subject of Chashmebaddur
 unhone wo rishi kapur ke saath shuru kar di
 While the shooting was happening, i called him to scold him
 govinda ne kaha, wo mujhe bole ki tu sun to sahi main kaise ye film bana rahaa hum
 i said why should i know what you are doing
 pehle haa to karata mujhe, kuch kaha bhi nahin, subject bhi uthaa liya
 Govinda had heard those things of David, after which the closed conversation Govinda said, i had changed a bit after leaving politics
 tab mere secretary david dhawan ke saath the, maine unase kaha tha ki phone spikar par rakhana, jo bhi david kahe main khud sunanaa chahta hum
 During that time David was saying- Chichi has started asking a lot of questions
 itane sawaal ki meraa dil nahin he uske saath kaam karun
 Tell him if you get a small thick roll then do it
 tab meraa dil tut gaya or maine kuch maheenon ke liye unase baat nahin kii

 Excerpts from the conversation with him: Many leaders like Ghanshyam Tiwari are against you in the party, will you be able to carry out the new responsibility properly? Without the workers, any party becomes exactly like water without fish
 party main meraa koi virdohi nahin he
 Do you have enough time to prepare so that you can defeat Ashok Gehlot's government in the election? His government has always run away from facing assembly sessions
 rajasthan ke itihaas main pehali baar aisa hua he ki vipaksh ko ekajute hokar raashtrapati or rajyapal se milakar unase aagrah karnaa padaa ki satr chalaaya jaae, taaki ham janata ke gusse ko sadan main uthaa saken
 The Gehlot government has not been able to walk even four steps in the last four years, the public knows this
 gahalot lagaataar yah aarope lagaate rahe hai ki aap rajasthan main nahin rahati or gambhir masalon par rah jaati hai
 Ask Gehlot himself, who, while in opposition from 2003 to 2008, has set a world record for not even speaking a word in the assembly
 jabaki maine to sadan ke har satr main bhaag liya, jansarokaar se jude muddon ko uthaaya or pradeshbhar main daure kiye
 Gehlot alleges that you have your eye on the land of the Statue Circle in Jaipur
 uskaa asal phayda uthaane waalon main ve companiyaan shaamil hai jinke maalikon ke saath unhone apane rishte hone kii baat khud maani he
 They have been dealing in the cases in which they point fingers at us
 rajasthan main bijepi kii pradesh adhyaksh banane ke baad mukhyamantri ne kaha ki aapako unka shukraguzaar hona chahie ki unhone aapke khilaaf nishaanaa nahin saadhaa
 What else can they say? For four years, he tried his best, handed over the task of searching thousands of files, but could not find anything wrong against me
 kisi jhooth ko sau baar dohraane se vah sach main nahin badal jaataa
 The Supreme Court quashed their Commission of Inquiry against me
 gahalot ke maamle main aap bahut saavdhaanee se kadam uthaati dikhti hai, kyon?meraa sara dhyaan (bataur mukhyamantri) is baat par kendrit tha ki rajasthan ko kaise pichde rajyon kii list se baahar nikaala jaae
 Experts and investors were taking precedent for my state as a state leading to success
 meri parvarish mujhe is baat kii ijaajat nahin detii ki main gahalot ke nijee jivan par akshep lagane kii had tak girun
 This does not mean that we or people have given them a clean chit
 bhrashtachar ne har str par apni jaden jamaa rakhi hai
 The officials who have been making money, now start celebrating your well
 baaki aap aage-aage dekhen, hota he kya
 What will be your issues in elections: corruption and disqualification of Hindutva or Gehlot? There is no dearth of issues
 par main abhi kyon bataaun? gahalot sarkaar naakaam rahi he or ham nishchit taur par janata kii samasyaon ko saamne rakhane vaale hai
 How will you connect the minorities? Gehlot fights the castes among themselves
 sitambar, 2011 main sarkaar ne gopalgarh main aise halaat paidaa kiye, jisase musalmaan vahaan maare gaye
 How can they forgive the Congress? When we were in power, people of every caste and religion including Muslims used to get equal respect and opportunity and everyone felt safe
 mukhyamantri jaipur main metro lekar aa rahe hai
 Will this affect your urban vote bank? In the process of starting the train somehow before the election, they thought of keeping the metro above the ground for the most part and thus they ended the beauty of our historic city

 You will definitely be worried about them

 On Tuesday, the District Court of Bulandshahr took cognizance of the charge sheet and removed Section 124A (sedition) from all the accused, rebuking the police as the police had not taken permission from the state home department to impose sedition
 vahiin, subodh kumaar kii patni rajani singh kaa aarope he ki police kii taraf se laaparvaahee barti gai he or police ne chargeshit kamazor karne ke liye hi deshadroh kii dhara ke liye zaruri prakriya puri nahin kii, jiske liye nyaayalay ne bhi police ko latad lagaai he

 The big thing is that all the accused caught in the cow murder are charged with treason, but the treason has been removed from those who killed the inspector brutally in an on-duty uniform

 ’ In school-college days, love is mostly confined to the pages of books
 kai baar aisa bhi hota he ki yah janmon ke bandhan se jud jaae lekin aise kisse kam hi sunne ko milte hai
 Have you ever wondered why it happens that teenage love becomes a mystery? Research in relation to relationship affairs has recently revealed that teenage love is love, but more comings are coming
 And due to this, the soft filings are completely eradicated
 kya kehete hai shodhakartastady ke kodeothar thao ha kaa kahana he kiserias relationships or shaadike baad aane vaale vivaadon ko log sulajhane kii koshish karte hai lekin agar tinej main aisa kuch hota he to couples ek duusare se kinaaraa karne kaa tarika dhundne lagate hai
 It can be estimated from this study that ninety percent of teenage love is not successful
 aaie jaane, tinej lav kii ye paanch baaten jo rishte main laati hai takaraav
 
 
 1
 aakarshan se hoti he shuruyattinej main hone vaala pyaar bahari sudarataa or charm kii taraf zyada jhukaav mahasoos karata he or yahi vajah hoti he ki vah sirf ek-duusare kii bhaawanaaon ko acchhee tarah samaj paane main asafal rahete hai
 2
 saath samay gujaarne main aata he majaapyar kii shuruyaat menek-duusare ke saathvakt bitaana hi kanls kaa main moto hota he or uske liye aksar class banks karnaa yaa phir ghar main jhooth bolnaa jaise kaam karnaa aam baat hoti he
 But when all these cause loss of career and studies, then the game-games begin
 yaheen se shuruyaat hoti he jhagadon kii or baton kaa bura maan jane kii
 3
 dhairya kii kami honasbakuch sahi chal rahaa hota he or achaanak se kisi ek din ek ke manaa karne par sabakuch bikhar jaataa he
 In fact, on the refusal of one of the teenage lovestories, another one thinks that maybe the work is filled with them and this happens to most girls
 4
 Relationship mostly takes timepass
 Understanding both care and aspect in new age love is a little difficult and for this reason, couples often do not understand each other
 ladke bevajaah hi apana haq jataane kii koshish karte hai or isi vajah se ladkiyaan khud ko asurakshit mahasoos karne lagati hai
 5
 jalan kii bhaavnaaye kisi bhibraop kaa sabase pehlakaaran banataa he
 Be it teenage or adult, burns occur in every age relationship
 edlt relationships main ek-duusare ko samajha liya jaataa he jabaki tinej kii nasamajhi ise samajhane nahin detii

 sheetakaaleen satr ke antim din rahul gandhi ne piem modi se us vakt mulaakaat kii jab uske kuch kshan baad congress ke netritv main vipakshi dal notebandi ke sawaal par raashtrapati se milane vaale the
 He was about to tell the President that the common people are facing a lot of enemies since the Prime Minister's sudden announcement of 500 and 1000 rupees
 congress ke is kadam se left samet khafa vipakshi dalon ne fori taur par ghoshnaa karte hue kaha ki vah us march main shaamil nahin honge
 It is believed that an appointment was made by the Congress to meet the Prime Minister two weeks ago
 darasal congress kisaanon se mili maangon kii suchi unako saunpna chaahati thi
 On the other hand, on the issue of demonetisation, the government, which is constantly facing opposition unity, broke the unity by giving an appointment on one occasion
 darasal is masale par congress ke bheetar naaraazgi or aarope-pratyarope kaa daur shuru ho gaya he or rahul gandhi ke netritv vaali yuva team or sonia ke vishwast puraane diggajon ke bich kalah ek baar phir sataha par aa gai he
 Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia denied reports that he had sought time for this meeting with PM Modi
 lekin yah bhi kaha ki ek baar mulaakaat kaa samay tay hone ke baad rahul gandhi ke liye usko nazarandaaj karnaa mumkin nahin tha
 In fact, some time ago, after meeting Gandhi's farmers, Rahul Gandhi had said that he would personally convey his demands to PM Modi
 ullekhneey he ki upi main agle saal kii shuruyaat main vidhansabha chunaav hone ja rahe hai
 Senior party leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma, who strategized the Congress in Parliament, also denied that they wanted Rahul's presence at that meeting
 sutron ke mutabik vipakshi dalon ne congress se aagrah kiya tha ki rahul gandhi kii is meeting ko kisi anya din ke liye taal diya janaa chahie
 The main reason for this was that during the entire winter session, Rahul played a major role in taking a front on behalf of the opposition on the issue of demonetisation
 lekin kul milakar aisa sambhav nahin ho sakaa
 The comments is sambandh main ensipi netaa praphul patel ne kaha, ''congress ne akele hi piem modi se milane kaa nishchay kiya
 This is not the way
 '' isi tarah basapa ke ek netaa ne kaha ki kya ham kisaanon ke palaayan se chintit nahin hai? sapa kii tarah basapa bhi raashtrapati se milane nahin pahunchi
 There is an angry murmur in this matter within the Congress
 darasal uske do din pehle hi rahul gandhi ne daawa kiya tha ki unke paas piem modi ke 'nijee bhrashtachar' ke sambandh main jaankaree he or yadi unako sansad main bolne kaa mauka diya gaya to vah uskaa pardaafash kar denge
 But instead of exposing him on the last day of the session, Rahul Gandhi went to meet PM Modi
 vahiin duusari taraf loksabhaa main sadan chalane kaa itnaa mauka de diya ki divyangon ke adhikaar se sambandhit bill paas ho gaya
 On the last day of the winter session, Rahul Gandhi met PM Modi when the opposition party led by the Congress was to meet the President a few minutes later on the question of demonetisation
 ve raashtrapati ko yah bataane ke liye jane vaale the ki pradhanmantri kii 500 or 1000 rupee kii achaanak ghoshnaa ke baad se aam logon ko behad dushwariyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 This move by the Congress led to an immediate announcement by the opposition parties, including the Left, that they would not join that march
 mana ja rahaa he ki congress kii taraf se do saptaah pehle pradhanmantri se mulaakaat ke liye apointment maanga gaya tha
 Actually the Congress wanted to hand over the list of demands received from the farmers to them
 duusari taraf notebandi ke masale par vipakshi ekajutata ke saamne lagaataar ghir rahi sarkaar ne ain maukey par mulaakaat kaa samay dekar us ekta ko tod diya
 In fact, a round of resentment and accusation has started within the Congress on this issue and discord has once again come to the surface between the Rahul Gandhi-led youth team and Sonia's trusted old stalwarts
 congressi netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya ne in reporton kaa khandan kiya he ki unhone piem modi se is mulaakaat ke liye samay maanga tha
 But it also said that once the appointment was fixed, it was not possible for Rahul Gandhi to ignore him
 darasal kuch samay pehle rahul gandhi ne upi ke kisaanon se mulaakaat ke baad kaha tha ki vah nijee taur par unki maangon ko piem modi tak pahunchaayenge
 It is worth mentioning that assembly elections are going to be held in UP early next year
 sansad main congress kii ranneeti banane vaale party ke varisht netaaon gulam nabi aaazaad or anand sharma ne bhi khandan kiya ki ve us meeting main rahul kii upasthiti chaahate the
 According to sources, the opposition parties had urged the Congress that this meeting of Rahul Gandhi should be postponed for another day
 uski badi vajah yah thi ki puure sheetakaaleen satr ke dauraan notebandi ke masale par vipaksh kii taraf se morcha lene main rahul kii mukhya bhoomika rahi thi
 But overall this could not be possible
 tippaniyan In this regard, NCP leader Praful Patel said, "congress alone decided to meet PM Modi
" yah koi tarika nahin he
 Similarly, a BSP leader said that we are not worried about the migration of farmers? Like the SP, the BSP did not even meet the President
 congress ke bheetar is maamle main naaraazgi bhari sugabugahat ho rahi he
 In fact, two days before that, Rahul Gandhi had claimed that he had information regarding PM Modi's 'personal corruption' and would expose it if he was given an opportunity to speak in Parliament
 lekin satr ke antim din usko ujagar karne ke bajaay piem modi se rahul gandhi mulaakaat karne chale gaye
 On the other hand, the Lok Sabha gave so much opportunity to the House that the bill related to the right of the disabled was passed

 hindustan main shiksha kaa ek ahm garh eemyu aajkal is nafrat kii aanch par ubal rahaa he ki jinna kii tasviir yahaan rahani chahie yaa nahin, jisaki shuruyaat sthaneey bijepi saansad kii maang se hui ki hindustan main jinna kii tasviir kaa kya kaam?vivaad kii shuruyaat bijepi saansad satish gautam kii ore se kulapati ko likhe khat se hui ki jisane bharat kaa vibhaajan karavaaya, us jinna kii tasviir uniwarsity main kyon lagi rahe
 On this, organizations advocating Hindutva started protesting
 chaatr sangh or hindu sanghathanon ke bich hinsak jhadap huin
 And then, Aligarh Muslim University turned into a camp
 1936 main hinduon or musalamaanon ke bich maansik bantwaare kii lakeer jinna ne khinch di thi
 Two years after that, this picture was found on this wall of Aligarh University
 uske 9 saal baad hi desh ko aazaadee mil gai or tasviir vaala ye cheharaa pakistan banaakar vahaan kaa governor general banakar chalaa gaya
 But for 80 years now, this picture hanging in silence has started screaming
 2 may ko eemyu ke campus main hindu sanghathanon kaa pradarshan hua
 Jinnah's effigy was also burnt
 purv up raashtrapati hamid ansaari kaa kaarykram tha, jo radd karnaa padaa
 In the midst of all this, when the students sat on a dharna, they alleged that they beat up a journalist
 eemyu kaa bavaal aligarh se nikalakar lakhanu or dilli tak raajnneeti ke peeche bhaagane laga
 Despite this much fanfare, the AMU administration says that even though Jinnah is a culprit of Indian history, it is also necessary to know that dark page
 to sawaal he ki kya isi naam par jinna kii tasviir desh ke ek mahaan shaikshanik santhaan ke maathe par chamakati rahegi
 Jinnah is the culprit of the 1947 Hindustan, who made a country of new found independence a victim of bloody partition
 lekin jaise har apradhi kaa ek acha ateet ho saktaa he, vaisaa hi ek ateet jinna kaa bhi rahaa he
 In those pages of the past, Jinnah Hindu Muslims appear to be advocates of unity, while elsewhere, Lokmanya Tilak as a barrister to save them from treason
 1947 main hindustan ke khooni bantwaare se teen dashak pehle ke mohammad ali jinna kuch or the
 In that Jinnah, there was the spirit of fighting for the country and removing the British from India
 isamen congress ke jis netaa se jinna sabase zyada prabhavit the, wo the lokmaanya balgangadhar tilak
 When the revolutionaries Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki were hanged, Tilak immediately raised the demand for Swaraj in his newspaper Kesari
 is par angrejon ne tilak par rajdroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya, jisamen unki taraf se jinna hi vakaalat kar rahe the
 But Jinnah could not save Tilak and he was imprisoned for six years from 1908 to 1914 in Mandalay jail in Myanmar for treason
 lekin do saal baad jab angrejon ne ek baar phir tilak par rajdroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya to jinna phir se unke vakil bane or is baar unhone tilak ko bachaa bhi liya
 After this, the relationship between Tilak and Jinnah was so strong that tilak-jinnah was pacted between the two in the same year ie 1916
 usamen ye faisla hua ki hindu muslim ekta ke liye donon kaum puri takat jhonkenge or usee takat ke saath angrejon kaa muqabla karenge
 But four years later, Tilak died in 1920 and Jinnah slowly drifted away from Congress politics

 The Supreme Court has asked Parliament to enact appropriate laws to protect live-in relationships and the rights of children born to them
 court ne liv in relationships ke ek maamle main faisla dete hue aise rishton kii paribhaasha nae sire se gadhi he
 The court has also given its perspective on many issues
 supreme court ne ek aise maamle main ye faisla diya he jisamen yuvati ne jaanate boojhte hue shaadishuda yuvak se liv in relation barkaraar rakhaa
 During this time, the young man also borrowed millions from the woman which was not repaid
 aakhirkaar yuvak ke iraadon se tang aakar yuvati ne apane saathi par gharelu hinsa kaa aarope lagaate hue guzaara bhatta kii guhaar court se lagaai
 In the Supreme Court, justices KS Radhakrishnan and Pinaki Chandra Ghosh clearly stated in their judgment that living in a live-in relationship is neither a crime nor a sin
 koi kisi ke saath shaadi karke rahe yaa bina shaadi ke
 
 
 This is his personal decision
 lekin court ne ye bhi saaf kiya ki liv in relationships ke harek maamle ko ek hi palade par nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 The court said that it is okay for a young man to live together without marriage, but it is not appropriate to live in a live-in relationship with a married and young child and then ask for alimony
 kyonki iskaa sidhaa asar vaid patni or santanon par padegaa
 This will be an injustice to them
 shaadishuda hone par liv in relation main rah rahi saathi ko patni kaa darja nahin mil saktaa
 She will remain below her wife
 lekin ye sarkaar kii jimmedaari he ki aise rishton se paidaa hone vaale bacchon ke adhikaron kii suraksha ke liye sansad main samuchit kanoon banawaaye
 Because in such circumstances, the worst effect is on such children

 Janata Dal United (JDU) National Vice President Prashant Kishor on Friday made it clear by tweeting that this time the responsibility of campaigning and managing his party in Bihar, senior party leader Ramchandra Prasad Singh (RCP Singh) ) Is on strong shoulders and their role is to learn and cooperate in the early stages of politics
 haalanki prashanth kishor ne apane twit main yah bhi mana he ki bihar main NDA mananeey modi ji (PM Narendra Modi) evam nitish ji (nitish Kumar) ke netritv main majbootee se chunaav lard rahaa he
 Experts believe that Prashant Kishor (prashant Kishor) deliberately made public the tweet in a way that party supremo Nitish Kumar did not give him any work in this election
 chunaav prachaar se lekar prabandhan tak kaa sara jimmaa aaaraseepi singh ke kandhon par he
 In Bihar, the NDA is contesting strongly under the leadership of Honorable Modi ji and Nitish ji
 JDU kii ore se chunaav-prachaar evam prabandhan kii jimmedaari party ke variya evam anbhavi netaa shri RCP singh ji ke majboot kandhon par he
 My role in this early phase of my politics has been to learn and support
 aaaraseepi singh, jo ki party ke andar ramchandra babu ke naam se jane jate hai, nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ke pichley do dashakon se khasmkhas rahe hai
 The party's actors have also remained the same since 2010
 haalanki sharad yadav jab tak rashtriya adhyaksh the tab tak aaaraseepi singh bihar kii raajnneeti main zyada sakriy rahe or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main to unhone booth management se lekar ummidavaaron ke chayan tak sab kuch khud kiya tha
 His specialty is that he does not like to talk to reporters much about himself
 shaayad yahi ek gun he jiske kaaran tamaam utaar chadhaav ke baavjood ve nitish kumaar kii naak ke bal bane rahe
 After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, most of the party leaders were publicly blaming RCP Singh for the party's misadventure, but Nitish Kumar, realizing the situation, took the responsibility of the defeat himself and resigned and he kept the agenda of Bihar politics
 Only changed
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main nishchit rup se lalu yadav ke saath gathbandhan hone ke kaaran aaaraseepi singh zyada sakriy nahin the kyonki lalu unako pasand nahin karte or us chunaav main lalu kii taraf se bholaa yadav va nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) kii taraf se prashanth kishor (prashant Kishor) raajnneetik massenger kii bhoomika adaa karte the
 Prashant Kishore got credit for the election results
 haalanki nitish kumaar kaa abhi bhi maananaa he ki us mahagathbandhan ke paas vot kaaphi adhik tha or uskaa cheharaa tha, usamen prabandhan kii bhoomika bahut simit thi
 After this, the new chapter started when Prashant Kishor (prashant Kishor) duly joined Janata Dal United and Nitish Kumar told him the future
 iske baad kai reportein bhi aisi aane lageen ki jaise nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ne unhen apana uttaradhikari hi maan liya
 Prashant missed one thing here
 nitish akhabaaron main or soshal media main khabaren to padhate hi hai, saath-saath khabar likhane vaale kii prishthbhumi agar nahin jaanate to usamen bhi unki dilchaspee jarur hoti he
 So from the very first day Nitish made it clear to everyone that Prashant Kishore's role would be to connect the youth with the party
 vahiin prashanth ko ummid thi ki nitish party ke chunaav kaa sara kaam, saath-saath prachaar kaa daayitv unke kandhe par daalenge
 But this did not happen
 nitish (nitish Kumar) ko kuch baaten kaaphi nagavar gujarin jisamen lagaataar televijan ke liye intervyuu main unke BJP ke saath waapas jane kaa mudda bhi tha
 Now when Neeraj Kumar, the spokesperson of the party directly against Prashant Kishor, started making statements and for three consecutive days he attacked him, criticizing him, then Prashant Kishore had no illusion that it was all Nitish This is being done with the consent of Kumar, because if they do not like something, then the message is given to the spokesperson that they should remain silent on this issue
 prashanth kishor ko sab kuch manjuur tha lekin shaayad yah baat unke gale se neeche nahin utar rahi thi ki unase desh main har party chunaav prachaar ke liye sampark kar rahi he or unki apni hi party unhen nazarandaaj kar rahi he
 He finally tweeted that after which Rama or slogan does not matter in the party, because Prashant Kishore also knows that in regional parties 'dulhan wahi jo piya man bhaye' means if the supremo is not happy with you then you are a living corpse Nothing else
 haalanki nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ko maaloom he ki philhal bihar main endie ke paas jo votbank he or vipaksh main jo bikharaav he vaise main unako prashanth kishor (prashant Kishor) kii utani jarurat nahin jitani prashanth kishor ko raajnneeti main unki jarurat he
 Nitish also knows that if Prashant Kishore leaves and goes away, then allies like BJP will be happy
 isliye isse bhi bada sach he ki nitish kumaar apana raajnneetik uttaradhikari kisi pichde samaaj ke netaa ko hi chaahate hai
 There is no confusion in his mind in this regard
 or aaaraseepi singh par unka bharosa abhi tak atoot he
 In the year 2013, Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan shocked everyone when they not only shook hands at Baba Siddiqui's Iftar party but also embraced each other
 bollywood main yah aitihaasik pal tha or ho bhi kyon naa aakhir 6 saal baad donon ke bich chal rahe cold war kaa ant jo ho gaya tha
 Something similar has happened once again
 ji haa, buudhvaar ko hue star gild main salmaan khan or shahrukh khan ne ek baar phir ek-duusare ko gale laga liya
 According to the news, Salman Khan was present at the stage so he was the anchor of the award ceremony
 tabhi shahrukh khan venue main pahunche or baithne ke liye kursi kii ore badhane lage tabhi salmaan ne unase kaha, 'shahrukh, kya ho rahaa he'? iske baad unhone shahrukh ko 'chennai express' kii apaar safalataa ke liye unhen badhai di
 Shah Rukh also did not delay and he greeted Salman with a nod
 baad main salmaan ne kaha ki ve sho host karne ke bajaae usamen parform karnaa zyada pasand karenge
 He said, 'I didn't know I'd host such a long segment
 ye sab inhone shuru kiya, shahrukh saab ne'
 Not only this, Salman also asked Shahrukh to speak 'jai Ho', which is the title of his upcoming film
 shahrukh ne bhi apane dost kaa maan rakhaa or kaha 'jai ho'
 Let me tell you that earlier when Salman and Shahrukh hugged at the Iftar party, Salman's father said that it was just courtesy and they can never be good friends because they are rivals of each other
 yah to sabhi jaanate hai ki shahrukh or salmaan main dushamani kii shuruyaat aaj se 6 saal pehle saal 2008 main katrina caff ke berthde par hui thi
 It is said that at that time, Aishwarya Rai had become a strong tu-tu, Main-me in Salman and Shahrukh over Bachchan
 or tabhi se donon ek-duusare se ukhde-ukhde rahete hai
 Well, maybe now this friendship of both of them goes forward or is it the beginning of another fight somewhere
 yah to aane vaala vakt hi batayega

 Sharad Pawar's supporters created uproar from the street to the Parliament
 police ne sharad pavaar ko thappad maarane ke aaropee harvinder singh ko giraftaar kar 14 dinon kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya
 See the photo of how the young man had slapped Sharad Pawar, the female teacher was angry in Muktsar in Punjab, but she did not slap Sarpanch Baljinder Singh but slapped Sarpanch Baljinder Singh
 baljinder ne mahila ko ek thappad nahin maaraa balki lagaataar kai thappad jad die
 There was a lot of uproar but the police did not take it into consideration
 kaaphi mushkil se police ne is maamle ko darj kiya or mahila kii saream pitayee ke baavjood baljinder ko turant jamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya
 Both of these incidents have taken place in this country, in the first incident a man slapped a Union minister, while in the second incident, a monarch slapped a female teacher

 greatbatch ab kiwi ballebaajon kii kabaliyat par bhi sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 According to Greatbatch, during the last four-five years, New Zealand players have been taught a lot about playing spin, the batsmen have to prepare for the spinners on the pitch, but the players may not want to learn anything
 yahi nahin, team ke captain ross tailor bhi apane ballebaajon ke pradarshan se maayoos hai

 It would not have been possible for India if BCCI President Sourav Ganguly had not been there
 yah ganguli kaa sapana tha or ise saakaar karne ke liye unhone koi kasar nahin chodi
 Harbhajan questioned the selectors, demanding a change from Ganguly that Ganguly said that during this match, there was an atmosphere like the World Cup final
 purv captain saurav ganguli ne kaha, 'aap, aas-paas dekhie (prashansakon ko dikhaate hue)
 have you seen this? When did you see so many viewers in the last Test match? It seems to be the final of the World Cup
 'bhartiya team ke purv captain ke chehre par is match ke aayojan ke prati santushti dekhi ja sakati thi
 Along with bringing satisfaction to the face, the pink ball test match did another job and that was to garnish Ganguly's memories of the historic Test match played with Australia at the same ground in 2001, when he was the captain
 ganguli ne kaha, 'oh! yah shandaar ahsaas he
 Feel good agar aap mujhase puuchhenge to isane meri 2001 ke yaaden taaja kar di hai
 That's how Test cricket should be, packed stadium
 ' bharat ke newjiland ke daure par kya gulabi gend se match dekhne ko mil saktaa he? is par ganguli ne kaha, 'abhi tak kuch bhi faisla nahin liya gaya he

 The fifth ODI between the two teams was played at Edgbaston on Tuesday

 On his appeal, the umpire gave Butler a run out, which was correct as per the rules

 Critics say that this run-out is contrary to sportsmanship
 aisa nahin hona chahie tha
 India had withdrawn the appeal
 One such case also came up in the February 2012 india-sri Lanka match

 Finch said after the Ranchi T20 that the new ICC rules in the middle of the series led to a situation of confusion
 yahaan tak ki team india ke openar shikhar dhawan bhi tii-20 ke in nae niyamon se puri tarah waakif nahin the
 The 30-year-old Finch said, "I didn't know about this until the 5th over of the match
 baad main jab steve smith maidan main drink lekar aae, to unhone saathi khilaadiyon ko iske bare main bataaya
 So we had to ask the umpires
 lekin siries ke aakhri daur main niyamon main ye badlaav ajeeb hai
 i mean bat size and things like that coming to the end of the series
 ’isisi ke nae niyam ke mutabik agar koi match 10 over se kam kar diya jaataa he, to gendbaaji kaa adhiktam kota 2 over se kam nahin hoga
 This means that if the match is reduced to 5 overs, at least two bowlers will be able to bowl two overs
 finch overon ke niyam ko lekar bhi naaraaz dikhe
 India got a target of 48 runs in 6 overs to win, so 3 bowlers should have been allowed to throw two overs
 lekin puraane niyamon ko hi chalane diya gaya
 Only Nathan Coulter Nile was able to bowl 2 overs, while Adam Zampa, Andrew Tye, Jason Behrendroff and Daniel Christian bowled one over each
 team india kii press conference main dhawan ne sweekaar kiya, ‘ vaaki unhen (australia) ajeeb laga hoga
 But whatever is the rule, it is the rule
 mujhe niyam ke bare main thik se pataa nahin he, jiske bare main aap baat kar rahe hai
 But, it is there

 vanade siries kii tarah finch yahaan bhi lay main najar aae
 He had played the sweep shot five times before being dismissed for 42 in this match, but he missed and was bowled on a full length ball from Yadav
 finch ne kaha, 'mujhe laga kii yahaan sweep karnaa ek surakshit vikalp he
 With this i could withdraw from the strike and send the ball across the boundary line by playing in an empty space
