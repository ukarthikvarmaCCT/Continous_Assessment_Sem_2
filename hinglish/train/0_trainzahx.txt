 jahaan ek taraf kishor kumaar or mohammad rafee ko unki veriation ke liye janaa jaataa tha, vahiin mukesh kaa andaaz kaaphi juda tha
 There is a pause in his sung songs that gives you relief even in pain, listening to them, you feel that you have reached a mountain where there is unmatched peace that gives peace to the soul
 22 july yani aaj diggaj parshvagayak mukesh kii 93veen jayanti he
 On this occasion, Google has also prepared a doodle in the memory of Mukesh - vaise to mukesh ke yaadgaar geet kisi ek din ke mohataaj nahin he lekin ham laa rahe hai is maukey par unke kuch khaas geet jo sune yaa dekhe jane chahie - By the way, a song sung by Mukesh in Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan's memorable film 'anand' is so sweet that only the songs of this film can be included in a list
 philhal is soochi main is film ke do gane shaamil kiye gaye hai
 'kahin far jab din din dhal jaye' This song cannot be performed in the voice of anyone else
 superhit film 'kabhi kabhi' kaa yah geet jisamen sahir kii likhi kavita ke saath mukesh ne kuch is tarah nyaay kiya he
 Films like Raj Kapoor were incomplete without Mukesh's voice
 'anaadi' bhi aisi hi ek film thi
 a romantic song like 'ramaiya Vastavaiya' could hardly be remade in the film 'shree 420' film 'meraa naam joker' kaa yah geet jo jindagi ke falsafe ko behad gaharaai se samajhaata he
 Another important song of 'kabhi Kabhi' is 'I am a poet of two moments' falsafon se bhare geeton ko mukesh se acha koun nibhaa saktaa he
 The comments 'sab kuch siikhaa hamane na sikhi hoshiyaari' mukesh bhi vivaadon se dur apni gayaki ke liye hi jane jate rahe In 'teesri Kasam', if the acting of Raj Kapoor along with the story burnt, then Shailendra's song and Mukesh's singing also set the tone
 ho saktaa he ki mukesh ke geeton ko lekar aapaki pasand is list main shaamil gaanon se alag ho, to neeche coment box main apni list hamaare saath saajha kiijie
 The good thing will be that you and our list will have one name - Mukesh
 
 
 vaise to rajesh khanna or amitabh bachchan kii yaadgaar film 'anand' main mukesh kaa gaaya ek ek geet itnaa madhur he ki ek list main to sirf is film ke hi gane samaa jaaen
 Currently two songs from this film have been included in this list
 'kahin dur jab din dhal jaae' is geet kii kalnpa kisi or kii awaz main nahin kii ja sakati
 This song from the superhit film 'kabhi Kabhi', in which Mukesh has done justice in this way, with the poem written by Sahir
 rajkpur kii filme jaise mukesh kii awaz ke bagaiyr adhuri hoti thim
 'anari' was one such film
 film 'shri 420' main 'ramaiya vastavaiya' jaisaa romantic geet shaayad hi dobaaraa ban paaya This song from the film 'mera Naam Joker' which explains the philosophy of life very deeply
 'kabhi kabhi' kaa hi ek or ahm geet 'main pal do pal kaa shaayar hum' Who can play songs full of philosophy better than Mukesh
 tippaniyan 'we learned everything, we did not learn intelligence' Mukesh was also known for his singing away from controversies
 'teesri kasam' main agar kahani ke saath saath rajkpur ke abhinay ne jaan foonki to shailendra ke geet or mukesh kii gayaki ne bhi chaar chand laga die
 Maybe your choice about Mukesh's songs is different from the songs in this list, then share your list with us in the comment box below
 acchhee baat yah hogi ki aapaki or hamaari suchi main ek naam samaan hoga - vah he mukesh

 The political backdrop was once a stronghold of the Jana Sangh led by former MP Jardan Tiwari, but the political picture of the district changed after the rise of Mohammad Shahabuddin in the late 1980s
 bahubali netaa mohammad shahabuddin 1996 se lagaataar chaar baar saansad bane

 In 1991, Brish Patel of Janata Dal became MP from here

 jabaki ek-ek seat bijepi-argedy or sipiai(ml)(l) ke khate main gayi
 Surrounded by these allegations, Om Prakash Yadav, MP of Omprakash Yadav, is surrounded by allegations of solar scam

 It was told that MP Omprakash Yadav has a solar company in another state
 usee se kharidari kar apane sansadeey kshetra main solar lite saansad nidhi se lagava rahe hai

 kolkata nite rides ke captain gautam gambhir kaa kahana he ki champiens trophy main khilne ke liye ipel khelnaa swaarth hoga
 Gambhir said that he has nothing in mind nor is he doing well in the IPL for Kolkata by thinking something like this
 yah khudgarji hogi or vah aise nahin
 In a statement to the website espncricinfo
com, Gambhir said that the ipl's performance is not a measure of selection in the ODI team, saying that performing well in the T20 format does not prove you eligible for the team selection for the ODI format, because both these formats Are different
 gambhir ne kaha, "main is baat par nishchit taur par sahamat hum ki tii-20 kaa acha pradarshan aapke liye ekadivasiy team ke chayan ke raste nahin kholta
 If you start selecting the team in this way, then there will be no recognition of the 50-over domestic competition
 "champiens trophy ko dhyaan main rakhkar nahin kar rahaa pradarshnaipiel ke is sijan main duusare sabase adhik score hasil karne vaale gambhir ne ab tak khele gaye 11 maichon main 411 ran banaae hai
 It consists of four fifties
 is par gambhir ne kaha ki yah galatfahami he logon kii, jo yah soch rahe hai ki vah bhartiya team main shaamil hone ke liye aisa kar rahe hai
 He is currently one of the hard working players to perform well
 gambhir ne aage kaha, jis vakt main champiens trophy ko dhyaan main rakhkar ipel main ran banane ke bare main sochoongaa, us pal main swaarthee kahalaaunga
 As a captain you cannot do this
 agar main is bare main sochna shuru kar duungaa, to kolkata team main kai aise khilaadi hai, jo is bare main sochna shuru kar denge
 This is not right aapako hameshaa vartmaan main rahanaa chahie
 All of this happens on its own and even if it doesn't, it's fine
 main chayan ke liye nahin, balki match main jeet ke liye kheltaa hum

 adbi duniya ko hairat hui jab maaya mrug ne fasebuk par likhane vaale kai logon ko mila kar ek stri vishyak kitaab 'stri hokar sawaal karti he' chhap di
 Purists also mocked this decision, but the book became very popular
 'maaya mrug' behtareen kavi hai or jaipur main apana bodhi prakaashan chalaate hai
 His publishing house constantly prints books in new ways
 vah swayan shandaar kavi hai
 Presenting a conversation with them
 aap shandaar kavitaayen likhte hai, prakaashak hai, dheron aayojanon main shirkat karte hai
 Where does one get the energy of such activism? Where is the need for a separate time to write a poem, it lives with you while doing every work
 kaaryakramon main bhagidaari, kavita or prakaashan darasal teenon ek jaise hi kaam hai
 Complement each other, helping each other
 likhnaa padhanaa prakaashan main madad karata he ar prakaashan aapako kaaryakramon main bhagidaari ke liye bhi prerit karata he
 Therefore, if i consider all these works to be the same, then there is only so much that one can do
 rahi baat urja kii to kaam apane aap main urjaadaayi hota he agar aapke man kaa ho
 Tell about the journey from journalist to writer and publisher
 saath hi yah bhi bataaen ki hindi kaa prakaashak kin chunautiyon kaa saamana karata he?ise or badhaakar kah sakate hai adhyaaapak se patrkaar, patrkaar se prakaashak
 These are all areas associated with the expansion of the same core sensation
 kuch saal skool-college main padhaayaa tab bhi likhane or yada kada akhabaaron main kollam aadi likhane chhapavane kaa shauk rahaa
 After some time, being able to teach between government bonds started becoming bored
 laga ki samay zyada kharaab hota he ar kaam ke naam par ek din main kul jamaa do-teen period padhaanaa, usamen bhi baar-baar chhuttiyaan yaa chaatro kii anupasthiti yaa gaiyr shaikshanik kaamon main lage rahanaa
 i felt that if i kept going like this, then i would be worthless
 main us vyavastha main feet nahin tha, haalanki padhaanaa mujhe aj bhi acha lagata he or shikshak ke kaam ko behad pasand karata hum par main un bandhanon ke bich padhaane kaa kaam nahin kar saktaa tha, ab bhi nahin kar saktaa
 So he quit his job and came to a newspaper
 akhbaar ke bare main hameshaa lagata tha ki is madhyam se kuch acha kiya ja saktaa he par yah bhram bhi lambey samay tak nahin bana rah sakaa
 Though learned a lot in the meantime, but could not do much
 yahaan tak to kahani phir bhi samaj main aati he lekin prakaashak banane kaa kaise tay kiya ?kitabon se lagaav bachapan se tha, isliye prakaashan kaa kaam acha laga
 Still feeling good, i'm doing jis din laga anupayogi ho gaya hum is kshetra ke liye to baahar ho jaaoongaa, kuch or dekhuunga
 There is a lot of spread in publishing work
 bahut staron par logon se kaam karana hota he
 On the one hand, one has to be in dialogue with an intellectual like writer, on the other hand, from compositor to binder, every kind of person gets to know
 kisi bhi str par koi ek galati puri mehnat par pani pher sakati he
 This is a matter of production kitabon kii bikri ko lekar vyavasthaaen kuch chhipi hui nahin hai
 The strangest rumble of government procurement in its place and the search for readers in Hindi
 chunautiyaan to har kaam main hai, isliye inase dar nahin lagata ab
 Hindi people cry that Hindi books are no longer read by people and you are printing books one after the other
 kya vaaki pathak kam ho gaye hai yaa ham un tak pahunch nahin paa rahe?haa yah sahi he ki hindi main kitaab padhane waalon me kami ai he yaa ki kahen abhi utani sankhya viksit hi nahin hui he jitani ki sambhaavnaaen hai
 But this deficiency is more in cities and metros only
 chote kasbon or gaanvon main ab bhi apaar sambhaavnaaen hai
 We have started a series of book exhibitions in towns and villages, there is a great response almost everywhere, the work is still going on
 mahanagaron kaa moh chhodkar pathakon kii talash sahi jagah karne kii zarurat he
 We must rest assured that readers in Hindi are not finished, they should be searched in the towns and villages, rather than in the metros where they are
 soshal media ne logon ko abhivyakti kaa nayaa madhyam diya he lekin abhi bhi isko gambhirtha se kam hi liya jaataa he
 But did you print poetry on clippings written on Facebook? Social media is the new medium of our time
 isane ek bada expoger diya he
 All those who kept writing silently, hid hither and thither, or kept locked in diaries and copies, who neither had much knowledge of publication nor had any intention of making such an attempt, found a stage at home
 yahi vajah rahi ki is manch par badi sankhya main gruhiniyan, yuva or khaskar ve jinhen saamanyat: hindi sahitya kii mukhyadhara main kabhi pahachaanaa nahin gaya, ve sab achaanak najar aane lage
 Even though they do not have that much maturity in their expression, they do have the naturalness and the mind to say
 vah silsilaa bataaie jab aapane fasebuk lekhan ko kitaabi shakl dene kii thaanee
 How did poems reach the book from the Facebook wall? Three years ago, we published a book by asking poets on female themes from creators writing on Facebook
 'stri hokar sawaal karti he' ek prayog tha, jise fasebuk par ar itar pathakon main bhi jabardast saraahna mili
 Three prints have been made so far
 swatantra pustak ke rup main saalim shuji ansari kii 'fasebuk ke abbajaan' or ek anya kavi kii 'laalitya lalit kii fasebuk kavitaayen' sheershak se kitaaben hamane chhaapi jinhen pathakon ne khub pasand kiya
 a compilation of 100 Facebook creators is currently under publication, most likely to be released at the World Book Fair 2015 in Delhi
 saahitiyik birdari se is masale par kisi pratikriya mili
 People take the poetry of social media seriously? Seriously, those people who do not take this medium will be intimidated by this medium
 jinako lagata he ki itani badi sankhya main likhane vaale aa jane se unki vishistataa khatre main pad jaaegi
 They do not want to identify themselves with this crowd
 aise mathadhishon ke math tootenge, isi se ve pareshaan hai
 Those who are genus are looking for possibilities in the weak expression of these new creators
 bahut saare nae rachanaakaar fasebuk se safar shuru karke sahitya main apni jagah banane main safal hue hai or bahut acha lekhan kar rahe hai
 How did the idea of converting scattered poems on Facebook into a book come from? The idea of printing compositions from Facebook was created because of the notion that it was a time-wasting or futile debate or just a virtual platform
 abhaasi or vaastavik duniya main darasal koi fark nahin hai agar aap yahaan phek idi ke saath maujuud nahin hai to
 The medium is made up of good or bad users
 It is up to you to watch porn pics or poems here
 kya kavita kaa yah manch mathadhishon ko sweekaarya hoga? kisi kism kaa tanj jo aapako is prayog par jhelana padaa ho?fasebuk ke rachanakaaron kii kitaab chhapane ke kaaran bahut se mathadhishon ne pichley pustak meley ke samay bodhi prakaashan ko phekbukiya prakaashak kahkar bahut majaak udaaya, jhuthe survey parinaam jari kare karaae or fasebuk rachanakaaron ko phek rachanaakaar bataakar hawa main udaane kii koshish kii
 We felt that this can be answered only with more serious efforts, this year a book of 100 creators is going to come in this episode
 yahaan yah khaas baat zarur ki fasebuk rachanakaaron kaa majaak udaane vaale khud fasebuk par hi apane samast kriya kalap chalaate hai mahatv bhi pate hai
 What are the plans for the near future, is there any idea to bring any other book on Facebook poems? Yes, after 100 poets, Facebook is considering a similar compilation for newcomers, ghazals and prose genres on this platform
 is
 iske alaava fasebuk par maujuud pratibhashali rachanakaaron par prakaashan kii drushti satat bani rahati he,unke swatantra sankalan ke liye aagrah kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, there is preparation for the fourth set of the book festival series (ten books for hundred rupees)

 India strongly believes in promoting and protecting human rights
 4
 Those who promote and financially support terrorism in any form in the region are in fact the biggest abusers of human rights
 5
 Pakistan is crying out for being a victim, when in fact it is itself a perpetrator of human rights abuses

 mohalat biit gai, japan sarkaar ne naa to paise die or naa hi aatankwaadiyon kii baaki maangen maanati he
 The same bloody video came out again
 tamaam fariyaadon, anurodhon, guhaaron, apilon, guzaarishon kaa hasil kuch nahin hua
 Rather, say that the charisma that the whole world had been hoping for in the request of these requests, could not be done at all
 jallaadon kii is duniya main naa to koi karishma mumkin tha or naa hua
 And ISIS, the world's most dreaded terrorist organization, beheaded the two Japanese hostages one by one
 balki naa sirf alag kar diya, aisi gairinsaani harakat kii ek-ek pal kii tasviir camere main kaid karne ke baad uskaa video bhi duniya ke saamne jari kar diya
 Those poor people have told that no one can be more merciless and greater than them in this world
 us maa ne apane bete kii jindagi kii khatir kya-kya nahin kiya, wo raat-din uuparavaale se haath jodakar apane bete kii jindagi baksh dene kii fariyaad karti rahi
 She kept on knocking on the door of her Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and pleading for any effective action
 wo press conference kar pathar dil aatankwaadiyon kaa dil pighalaane kii koshish karti rahi
 She kept saying that her son is a very good person, he always helps others
 aise main aatankwaadiyon ko bhi unke bete par raham karnaa chahie
 But the terrorists neither had mercy nor did they
 do japani bandhakon ko chhodane ke badalane kul 20 karod dollar yani 12 sau karod rupee kii baari-bharkam phiroti maanganevaale darindon ne maang puri naa hone par ek-ek kar donon kaa sir kalam kar diya
 After capturing the Japanese freelance journalist Kenji Goto and businessman Haruna Yukawa, these terrorists first realized the threat of the world as they released the video of the two
 kyonki isse pehle iesas isi tarah america patrkaar james phole, british patrkaar steven sotlauf, british maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta david hence, british bandhak alen hanning or yues aid kaaryakarta peter cassing kaa sir kalam kar chukaa tha
 They say no, as long as breath is there
 jab tak goto or uakava kii saansen chal rahi thim, tab tak unke gharavaale ummid kaa daaman thame baithe the
 But now there is neither breath nor hope
 aatankiyon ne 24 janvari ko kaarobaari haruna uakava kaa sir kalam karne ke baad kenji goto ke maut kaa countdown shuru hone kaa elaan kar diya tha
 Exactly 7 days later, on 31 January, he also did the same thing with Goto as with Yukawa or the hostages killed before that
 iesas ke sabase badnaam kasaai jehadi jon ne khud apane haathon se goto kaa bhi sir kalam kar diya
 In fact, ISIS was also angered by Japan's non-strategic assistance to the people and many civilians displaced in the Islamic State war
 isi bich jab do japani bandhak unke haath lage, to unhone pehle to jaapni sarkaar se moti rakam vasuulne kii koshish kii
 But when Japan did not take any flexible approach in this matter, Japanese businessman Yukawa was killed by saying that the death count first started and then goto the journalist
 haalanki ab bhi japan ne apni nitiyon main koi tabdili naa karne kii baat kahi he
 Rather it is also said that they will continue to fight against terrorists
 iesas jab bhi camere par kisi bandhak kaa video jari karata he, amuman use maar daalata he
 So far he has done this seven times and seven times he has beheaded
 magar in saat video se alag pehali baar usne pichley hafte ek nayaa video jari kiya
 That too from a new location
 is video main ek faujee ko maarthe dikhaaya gaya he
 But for the first time, ISIS enters the White House and threatens to kill the US President before killing that soldier
 iesas duniya bhar main khauf failaane ke liye media or soshal media kaa istemaal shuru se hi kar rahaa he
 With this help, he brainwashes new boys and then joins them
 duniya ke bahut saare mulkon ke ladke bhatakkar syria or iraq tak pahunch chuke hai
 Now the same ISIS is bringing its own TV channel to show the world new pictures of fear and horror
 duniya kaa aman-chaiyn chhinane vaale iesas ke aakaa abu bakar al-bagdadi ne ek nayaa faisla kiya he or wo he iesas kaa apana khud kaa ek tivi channel laanch karne kaa faisla
 Before this, the world has seen all the pictures of the terror of ESIS through any other TV channel
 lekin ab duniya iesas ke aatank kii jitani bhi tasviren dekhegaa wo sab uske tivi channel par dekhegaa or usne apane is tivi channel ko naam rakhaa he ‘da islamic callyphat broadcast
 Not only this, ISIS has also released a 'promo' of this TV channel, so that the world knows what ISIS is going to do
 bataa den ki ye 24 ghante kaa pehla aisa online tivi channel hoga jise koi aatankwaadi sanghathan chalaaegaa
 According to a report, the terrorists' new TV channel khilafalive
 info naam kii website se prasaarit hoga
 Its test signal has also started
 twitor par post kiye gaye iske test card par khilafalive likhaa hua he
 According to a website report, it will be a 24x7 online propaganda channel and will feature a program from a British hostage John Cantley as a presenter
 jon cantali kaa program 'time tu recruit' har buudhvaar kii shaam on air hoga
 Apart from this TV channel, ISIS is already running an FM radio station in the city of Mosul, Iraq, which promotes the Islamic State only and only
 twitor par iesas samarthakon kii ore se nae tivi channel ke liye media or technology se jude logon kii bhartee kii kavayad puure jorshor se chal rahi he
 According to experts, there is not only dangerous terrorists in the bloody army of ISIS but also experts who are aware of the technology of internet, social media, radio and TV channels
 inaki madad se wo ab duniyabar main apni dehshat kii tasviren prasaarit karegaa
 ISIS has been spreading terror network continuously, despite all efforts, the US and European countries have not been able to eradicate ISIS
 naa hi soshal media or internet par uski maujuudagi ko mitaayaa ja sakaa he
 So, if the TV channel of ISIS comes into existence, Baghdadi and its hangman henchmen will not be able to say what will happen on the small screen
 iesas ne jab bhi apana vedia jari kiya he to har baar nakaab ke peeche haathon main khanjar liye ek hi jallaad dikhaai detaa he
 The executioner first speaks something in English on the camera and then gives a head pen in front of the camera
 ab sawaal ye he ki aakhir ye he koun? kahaan se aayaa he or kyon aisa karata he?duniya ko hilaa dene vaali tasveeron main katane vaala sir har baar beshak kisi nae insaan kaa tha, lekin kaatane vaale haath har baar ek hi shaks ke rahe
 This executioner is identified
 
 
 naam:jihadi jonpahchaan:iesas kaa aatankwadikam:begunaahon kaa sir kalam karanaapane sir kalam karne kii sanak ke chalate duniyabar main badnaam jihadi jon kii asaliyat tab pehali baar jamaane ke saamne ai, jab iesas ne begunaahon ko markar america or britain ko chetane ke silsile main 21 agast ko pehali baar patrkaar james phole kaa sir kalam kiye jane kaa video jari kiya
 In fact, in this video, the first jihadist John opposed the attacks on ISIS
 lekin apane chehre par nakaab lagaae rakhane ke baavjood suraksha agenciyon ne use uski aawaaj or angreji bolne ke andaaj se pahchaan liya
 The murderer was none other than the same Jihadi John who had once lived in Britain and fled from there with the intention of joining ISIS
 vaise bich main ye bhi khabar ai thi ki ek hawaii hamale main jihaddi jon buree tarah se jakhmi ho gaya he or maut kii kagaar par he
 But now in this new video, he is standing behind Japanese hostages holding a knife in his hand in exactly the same manner as the video ISIS had released earlier
 nadi kaa koi rang nahin hota
 The river knows to flow
 samay se pare anant kaal se bahati he nadi
 The river is a silent witness
 wo sab kuch dekhati he
 Does not retaliate phir bhi bahati rahati he nihshabd or apaar
 When the same story of the river falls into words, the agony tale of the river Jamuni comes out
 malini gautam angreji kii professor hai
 He has described the pain of this river flow in Hindi
 nadi kabhi stri kaa rup leti he, to kabhi ladki kaa
 Every river is a story of which you can find any color in the waves flowing yesterday
 ye rang kabhi dhokhe kaa he kabhi darkate rishton kaa, lekin nadi kaa bahaav sabit karata he ki sabase chatkh rang pyaar kaa he
 Malini's poems also tell the story of love
 pyaar kaa yahi rang kabhi jamuni nadi kii tarah nikharata he, to kabhi chhatari ban kar ye ehsaas dilaataa he ki parivaar ke liye striyaan kis tarah dhuree ban jaati hai
 a river of happiness and sorrow flows inside every woman
 ye sangrah aisi hi kai nadiyon kaa sangam he
 There are small sorrows in it, small pleasures, but in the end the color of hope is the brightest and thickest
 thik us gauraiya kii tarah jo ek tukdaa dhoop ke intazaar main na jane kab se ghar ke ahaate main baithi he
 The yellow headlines of Amaltas have puberty, while the tales of dried leaves of Ishq are also from the same strength
 barsaat main kadamon ke nishaan talashne kii jid he
 Each poem is a brief document of its time and in this sense Malini has managed to make her point
 malini kii ye kavitaayen is drushti se sarthak hai ki yahaan kahin shabdon kaa aadambar nahin
 These poems flow like a river, which does not even know when you read and moisten your mind

 The film is being released across the country on January 25
 haal hi main is film ko lekar senior actor naanaa patekar se hui baatcheet utyub par viral ho rahi he
 When asked that the Supreme Court has given the green signal for the release of the film but the kind of protest is taking place

 It is common for films to be roused
 jab movie ko sensor se green signal mil gaya to wo relies hogi
 However make a film on the right subject
 aap sahi film banaaenge to log riect nahin karenge
 If you make a wrong film, people will definitely react
 film ke vishay par rakhen dhyanmeri film main kabhi koi kaantrovarsi nahin hui, maine krantivir jaisi filmein banaai, bold statement hone ke baavjood un par kabhi koi bavaal nahin hua
 It is important to remember what you are thinking about making the film

 How much truth lies inside you is visible in the eyes

 While making the film, it is the responsibility of the makers to not hurt anyone

 The government is ascertaining how Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seen in foreign media during his foreign trip, for this, the coverage on Modi in foreign newspapers and channels is being monitored
 is kaam ko anjaam de rahaa he bharat kaa soochna evam prasaaran mantralay
 According to reports published in foreign media, PM Modi is currently looking ahead of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in terms of word count
 sitambar 2014 main piem modi kii pehali america yatra ke dauraan unke kaaryakramon ke bare main international media main 31 lekhon main 27,639 shabd likhe gaye the
 At the same time, when Manmohan Singh went to America in 2009, only 7,596 words were written in 8 articles
 jab baraak obama piem modi ke nyaute par janvari 2015 menganatantr diwas parade main mukhya atithibanakar bharat aae the to top 10 news channelon ne unka 255 ghante tak kawarej kiya, jabaki 2010 main jab vah upie shashan main bharat aae the, to kawarej keval 82 ghanton kaa rahaa tha
 Doordarshan also covered the 2015 Obama trip 33 hours 45 minutes, while in 2010 it gave him only 5 hours 49 minutes
 ye aankade soochna evam prasaaran mantralay kii reports main hai
 The ministry is monitoring the reaction of Indian and foreign media on Modi's foreign visits and comparing them to Manmohan Singh's visits
 mantralay monitering cell ne ek nae media cell ke saath milakar aisi 1,595 reports saunp chukaa he

 3 fisad gramin gharon or 96
 2 percent of urban homes have toilets
 lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi daawa kar chuke hai ki bharat khule main shouch se mukt ho chukaa he
 So the question arises that the remaining 28 in rural India
 7 fisad log shauchalay ke liye kahaan jate hai?'drinking water, sanitessan, hygin and houseing condishan' sheershak se jari is report main 'shauchalay' ke sawaal ke jawaab ke saamne yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki sawaal poochne se pehle ho saktaa he ki sample main shaamil logon ko yah bataaya gaya ho ki unhen sarkari shauchalay milane kii ummid he, isliye pakshpaat hone kii puri sambhaavna he

 Flush is used in 9% of urban areas

 4 in rural areas during the survey
 5 fisad gharon or shahari ilaakon main 2
 1 percent of households did not have a water source around latrine
 yah bhi ek bada kaaran he ki shauchalay ban jane ke baad bhi log khule main shouch ke liye jate hai
 The most special thing in this report is that when people were asked why they do not use it even when the toilet is in the house? The answer was shortage of water
 pani ke sankat kii vajah se 3
 5 percent rural areas and 1
 7 fisad shahari ilaakon ke log shauchalay hone ke baad bhi iskaa istemaal nahin karte hai

 jab bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne BJP ke saath ek baar phir sarkaar banaai thi tab yah mana ja rahaa tha ki kam se kam bihar main BJP ke bahari netaaon ko prachaar karne kaa mauka kam milegaa lekin lagata he BJP ko ab nitish kumaar par utana bharosa nahin rahaa
 That is why on Thursday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath reached Poonia to address booth level workers
 yahaan unhone mukhyamantri ke rup main nitish kumaar ke kaam kii saraahna kii or unhen ek lokapriy mukhyamantri bataaya
 Yogi Adityanath while addressing the booth level workers of BJP said that Bihar has gone out of Jungle Raj
 pehle noujvaan sankat main the or kahin jane par apni pahchaan chhipate the
 Now under the rule of Nitish Kumar, he feels proud of himself and on going out says that he is a resident of Bihar
 yogi adityanath ne is avasar par logon ko kumbh main aane kaa nyauta bhi diya or kaha ki ab unhen elahabaad nahin prayagraj aana he
 Gone are the days when people used to go to Faizabad
 ab unhen ayodhya nagari janaa padataa he
 Yogi claimed that from January to February 5 in this year's Kumbh, a record 14 crore people have taken bath in Sangam
 darasal BJP kii ranneeti he ki vahaan ke chaar loksabhaa kshetron main se jin do loksabhaa kshetron main vah chunaav ladegi vahaan jab tak sampradayik rup se dhruvikaran nahin hoga tab tak unke ek ummidavaar ke jeetne kii ashanka kam he
 So she wants either Yogi to campaign vigorously or polarized leaders like him to be activated there
 isliye unka maananaa he ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se zyaada prabhavi party yogi adityanath ko maanati he

 saath hi bharat kaa asian deshon ke saath rishta or pragadh hoga
 The President of all 10 ASEAN countries has been invited to celebrate the 25th year of the india-asean Commemorative Conference in New Delhi on 25 January and through a grand event, India further strengthens its relations with south-east Asia countries Will do
 is kshetra main china ke aakraamak tevar kaa jawaab dene ke liye bharat kaa asian deshon ke saath raajnneetik sambandh behad majboot karnaa jaruri ho jaataa he
 Apart from the conference, several heads of ASEAN countries will also meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi separately
 modi ke satta main aane ke baad desh main yojit yah apni tarah kaa teesraa sabase bada sammelan hoga
 Prior to this, preparations are on to increase the country's participation internationally through the third indo-africa Summit in 2015 and the BRICS Summit in Goa in 2016
 kya he asian8 agast, 1967 ko indonesia, malaysia, philippines, singapore or thailand ne saath milakar dakshin purv asian deshon kaa samooh yani asian kaa gathan kiya tha haalanki tab is baat kaa anumaan nahin tha ki yah sanstha jald hi apni khaas pahchaan bana legi
 There have been 31 ASEAN summits so far
 10 sadasyon vaali is sanstha kaa mukhya makasad dakshin purv asia kshetra main arthvyavastha, raajnneeti, suraksha, samskruti or kshetreey sahyog ko badhanaa tha

 8 trillion dollars
 yah sahi he ki asian ek vikasshil deshon kaa gut he lekin aaj gaiyr-sadsy america, china or japan jaise sampann desh isamen khaasi ruchi rakhte hai
 On the other hand, India, despite not being a member, is constantly trying to maintain a better relationship with ASEAN
 asian main bruneii, myanmar, cambodia, indonesia, laos, malaysia, feelippines, singapore, thailand or vietnam desh shaamil he
 Struggle for sea route China's interference in Asia is increasing continuously, while India also has large trade with South China Sea, so it is very active about this region
 duusari ore, america bhi bharat ke sahare is kshetra main apni dhamak banaae rakhana chahta he jisase china is kshetra main apni ekatarfa sthiti kaa phayda na uthaa sake
 India and the United States have been talking about trade independently by sea route
 agar china is kshetra main apni pakad majboot kar letaa he to isse bharat kaa vyapaar prabhavit hone ke asaar bad jaaenge
 Therefore, it is not only necessary for him to be associated with ASEAN but he should also put problems related to this organization in front of him
 media reports bataate hai ki china kii asian main acchhee khaasi pakad ho gai he or usamen khaasaa dakhal bhi detaa he
 This is the reason why there is no issue in ASEAN regarding the South China Sea
 asian desh china ke khilaaf jane kii himmat tak nahin kar pate
 China and the US intervened in this organization due to strengthening the strategic position and due to this it became so important

 Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the three countries together are working on this 1,400 km long highway
 yah dakshin asian desh thailand ko sadak maarg se bharat se jod degaa jisase teenon desh ke kaarobaar, vyapaar, swasthya, shiksha or paryaton kshetra ko vruddhi milegi
 India is working on this with high priority to complete the work on time

 There is talk of completing the Tripartite Motor Vehicle Agreement for the use of 1400 km of roads

 For this, a bench of three judges has been made
 teen talaak, bahuvivaah ke saath-saath whatsap, fasebuk karne waalon kii niztaa ke adhikaar par bhi sunwaayee hogi
 There is another matter
 avaidh rup se jo sharnaarthi aae hai unke bacchon ko naagarikta diye jane ke maamle main bhi sunwaayee hogi
 This is also good
 varshon tak sunwaayee hone se acha he ki is tarah se kuch mahatvapurn maamalon kii sunwaayee chhuttiyon ke dauraan puri kar lee jaae
 If decided, even better
 24 april 2016 ko pradhanmantri modi ne jajon kii sabha main chuttee ko lekar aagrah kiya tha ki is bare main sochaa janaa chahie varna court kaa samay kabhi badhaayaa hi nahin ja sakegaa
 We are all becoming accustomed to the fact that the number of judges in the courts is small, the trial continues for years
 ise lekar ek sanstha ne adhyayan kiya he ki kyon deree hoti he
 The study is conducted by an institution called the Law Center for Legal Policy
 iske liye dilli hai court ke 1,129 maamalon se jude 8,086 adeshon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he
 As a sample, these orders have been selected out of 2,02,595 cases filed between 2011-15
 inamen se 1,22,245 cese ko aath shreniyon main baant kar unka sample liya gaya he
 Attempts have been made to find out the reasons behind the delay in hearing from the verdict
 nyaayik deree ke sawaal ko aksar ham dharna ke str par hi samajhate hai
 The reasons why there is delay are less discussed
 kya jaj sahab kii gair haaziri ke kaaran deree hui, yaa vakil sahab ne baar-baar akaaran sthagan aadesh le liya, yaa vakil hi haazir nahin hue, yaa adaalat ke paas vaaki itane maamle hote hai ki har cese par jinata samay dena chahie utana hota hi nahin he
 The Law Legal Center has tried to find out what causes the most delays
 adjarnment yani sthagan aadesh ke kaaran hoti he
 Adjournment is the biggest reason
 91 fisadi jin maamalon main deree hui he unamem adrgement ek kaaran to he hi
 In 70 per cent cases, there have been delays due to adjuncts thrice
 aderjanment ke bhi alag-alag kaaran hote hai
 In July 2016, Justice Deepak Mishra and Justice Nariman of the Supreme Court warned the trial court that the adulteration is similar to a virus
 is par ankush lagane kii zarurat he
 In Gayatri vs m Girish case, these two judges of the Supreme Court said that the witness who was called seven times was called in the court, the witness came but the lawyer repeatedly asked for the award and was given it
 iske baad supreme court ke donon jaj apane faisle main alag-alag jagahon par likhte hai ki, 'hame yahaan par kahana padegaa ki jo trial jaj the, wo kisi bhram the kyonki bachaav paksh or yachikakarta ke dimaag main kuch or hi chal rahaa tha
 The court continued to adjudicate
 bachaav paksh ne gavaah se bhi poochtacha nahin kii or agali taarikh lete rahe
 It can be imagined that an elderly man could face such difficulty in coming to court so many times to testify
 trial court ne is masale ko 3 oktober 2015 tak sthagit kar diya
 That day also the witness came to the court but the defense and the counsel for the petitioner did not come to court
 court ne phir se matter ko adjarn kar diya
 The case was deliberately delayed by seeking an advertisement
 adaalat main jitne bhi maamle honte hai wo court ke saamne pending hi kahe jate hai
 Whether it is two months old or two years old
 lekin vidhi sanstha ne yah dekhne kaa prayaas kiya he ki jin maamalon main faisla aayaa, unamem kin kin kaarnon se deree hui, agar wo deree na hoti to kya faisla or jaldi aa saktaa tha
 The Delhi High Court has a very good record in disposing of cases
 2011-15 ke bich jitne bhi cese file hue hai unka 76 fisadi hissaa 2015 tak nipta diya gaya
 Of these, 60 per cent of the cases were settled within six months
 dilli hoicourt kaa yah record to shandaar lagata he lekin kya duusari adaalaton ke bare main bhi aisa kaha ja saktaa he
 Incidentally, the lawyers have also gone on strike on Friday
 lau kamishan ke kuch sujhaavon ko lekar unka virodh he
 The comments lau kamishan ne edwocket act main sanshodhan kaa suzav diya he taaki ve hadtaal na kar saken
 If you go on strike, your client will have to pay damages
 isamen vakeelon ke peshewar vyavhaar ko bhi paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 If a lawyer is convicted of misconduct charges, his license can be canceled
 jaise kisi cese main unhone thik se mehnat nahin kii, laaparvaahee kii, kisi se saudebaazi kar lee, to ise ab anuchit vyavhaar mana jayega
 Lawyers say this suggestion is against their right to protest
 vakeelon par teen se paanch lakh ke jurmaane kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 If they were found to be misbehaving with their client
 agar vakil kaam par nahin aae to apane muvakkil ko harjaana dena hoga
 So why is there delay in hearing to verdict
 iske zimmedaar koun hai or kaise ise thik kiya ja saktaa he? For this, 8,086 orders related to 1,129 cases of Delhi High Court have been studied
 sample ke taur par in adeshon kaa chunaav 2011-15 ke bich daayar 2,02,595 maamalon main se kiya gaya he
 Of these, 1,22,245 cases have been divided into eight categories and sampled
 sunwaayee se lekar faisle tak pahunchane main deree ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kii gai he
 We often understand the question of judicial delay at the level of perception itself
 kyon deree hoti he iske kaarnon par kam charchaa hoti he
 Was the delay due to the non-attendance of the judge, or did the lawyer repeatedly take the adjournment order without reason, or did the lawyer not appear, or the court really has so many cases that the time spent on each case should have been more Is not the same
 vidhi legal centre ne pataa lagane kii koshish kii he ki sabase adhik deree kis kaaran se hoti he
 Adjournment is due to a stay order
 adjarnment sabase bada kaaran niklaa he
 In 91% of the cases where delay has been made, there is a reason for adjustment
 70 fisadi cese main to teen teen baar adjarnment ke kaaran deree hui he
 Emergence also has different reasons
 july 2016 main supreme court ke justise deepak mishra or justise nariman ne trial court ko chetavanee di thi ki aderjanment ek virus ke samaan he
 There is a need to curb this
 gayatri banaam em girish maamle main supreme court ke in do jajon ne kaha ki jo gavaah he use saat baar court main bulaayaa gaya, gavaah aayaa bhi lekin vakil ne baar-baar adjarnment maanga or use diya bhi gaya
 After this, both the judges of the Supreme Court write in different places in their decision that, 'we have to say here that the trial judges were some illusions because something else was going on in the mind of the defense and the petitioner
 court adjarnment detaa rahaa
 The defense also did not interrogate the witness and kept taking the next date
 ek bujurg aadmi ko gavaahi dene ke liye itani baar court main aane main kya dikkat pesh ai hogi, isaki kalpana kii ja sakati he
 The trial court adjourned the issue till 3 October 2015
 us din bhi gavaah court aayaa lekin bachaav paksh or yachikakarta ke vakil hi court nahin aae
 The court again adjudicated the matter
 aderjanment maang kar is cese main jaanboojh kar deree kii gai
 All the cases that are held in the court are called pending before the court
 chaahe wo do maheene puraane hon yaa do saal
 But the legal institution has tried to see that in the cases where the decision was taken, for what reasons it was delayed, if it was not delayed, what decision could have come sooner
 maamalon ko nipataane main dilli hai court kaa record bahut acha mana jaataa he
 76% of all the cases filed between 2011-15 were settled by 2015
 inamen se 60 fisadi cese chah maheene ke bheetar nipta diye gaye
 This record of Delhi High Court sounds fantastic, but can the same be said about other courts

 He is opposed to some of the Law Commission's suggestions
 tippaniyan The Law Commission has suggested amendments to the Advocate Act so that they do not go on strike
 agar hadtaal par gaye to apane muvakkil ko harjaana dena hoga
 It also defines the professional behavior of lawyers
 agar kisi vakil par missconduct ke aarope sabit ho gaye to unka license radd ho saktaa he
 For example, in a case they did not work properly, they were negligent, they bargained with someone, then it would now be considered inappropriate behavior
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki yah suzav unke virodh karne ke adhikaar ke khilaaf he
 There is also a provision for fine of three to five lakhs on lawyers
 agar ve apane muvakkil se galat vyavhaar karte paae gaye to
 If the lawyer does not come to work, then your client will have to pay damages
 to kyon hoti he sunwaayee se lekar faisle main deree
 Who is responsible for this and how can it be rectified? nyaayik deree ke sawaal ko aksar ham dharna ke str par hi samajhate hai
 The reasons why there is delay are less discussed
 kya jaj sahab kii gair haaziri ke kaaran deree hui, yaa vakil sahab ne baar-baar akaaran sthagan aadesh le liya, yaa vakil hi haazir nahin hue, yaa adaalat ke paas vaaki itane maamle hote hai ki har cese par jinata samay dena chahie utana hota hi nahin he
 The Law Legal Center has tried to find out what causes the most delays
 adjarnment yani sthagan aadesh ke kaaran hoti he
 Adjournment is the biggest reason
 91 fisadi jin maamalon main deree hui he unamem adrgement ek kaaran to he hi
 In 70 per cent cases, there have been delays due to adjuncts thrice
 aderjanment ke bhi alag-alag kaaran hote hai
 In July 2016, Justice Deepak Mishra and Justice Nariman of the Supreme Court warned the trial court that the adulteration is similar to a virus
 is par ankush lagane kii zarurat he
 In Gayatri vs m Girish case, these two judges of the Supreme Court said that the witness who was called seven times was called in the court, the witness came but the lawyer repeatedly asked for the award and was given it
 iske baad supreme court ke donon jaj apane faisle main alag-alag jagahon par likhte hai ki, 'hame yahaan par kahana padegaa ki jo trial jaj the, wo kisi bhram the kyonki bachaav paksh or yachikakarta ke dimaag main kuch or hi chal rahaa tha
 The court continued to make adjustments
 bachaav paksh ne gavaah se bhi poochtacha nahin kii or agali taarikh lete rahe
 It can be imagined that an elderly man could face such difficulty in coming to court so many times to testify
 trial court ne is masale ko 3 oktober 2015 tak sthagit kar diya
 That day also the witness came to the court but the defense and the counsel for the petitioner did not come to court
 court ne phir se matter ko adjarn kar diya
 The case was deliberately delayed by seeking an advertisement
 adaalat main jitne bhi maamle honte hai wo court ke saamne pending hi kahe jate hai
 Whether it is two months old or two years old
 lekin vidhi sanstha ne yah dekhne kaa prayaas kiya he ki jin maamalon main faisla aayaa, unamem kin kin kaarnon se deree hui, agar wo deree na hoti to kya faisla or jaldi aa saktaa tha
 The Delhi High Court has a very good record in disposing of cases
 2011-15 ke bich jitne bhi cese file hue hai unka 76 fisadi hissaa 2015 tak nipta diya gaya
 Of these, 60 per cent of the cases were settled within six months
 dilli hoicourt kaa yah record to shandaar lagata he lekin kya duusari adaalaton ke bare main bhi aisa kaha ja saktaa he
 Incidentally, the lawyers have also gone on strike on Friday
 lau kamishan ke kuch sujhaavon ko lekar unka virodh he
 The comments lau kamishan ne edwocket act main sanshodhan kaa suzav diya he taaki ve hadtaal na kar saken
 If you go on strike, your client will have to pay damages
 isamen vakeelon ke peshewar vyavhaar ko bhi paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 If a lawyer is convicted of misconduct charges, his license can be canceled
 jaise kisi cese main unhone thik se mehnat nahin kii, laaparvaahee kii, kisi se saudebaazi kar lee, to ise ab anuchit vyavhaar mana jayega
 Lawyers say this suggestion is against their right to protest
 vakeelon par teen se paanch lakh ke jurmaane kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 If they were found to be misbehaving with their client
 agar vakil kaam par nahin aae to apane muvakkil ko harjaana dena hoga
 So why is there delay in hearing to verdict

 Jaiswal, referring to the achievements of Maharatna company Coal India in the conversation, said, "glad that Coal India's growth has crossed nine percent in the first half of this year
 ummid he ki saal puraa hone tak yah doguni ho jaaegi
 Last year, this growth percentage was zero
 ’’ unhone kaha ki kendra ne urja kshetra ko is saal 12 pratishat badhotaree ke saath koyale kii aapurti kii he, jabaki rashtriya tapiya vidyut nigam ko 18 fisad ijaphe ke saath aapurti kii gai he
 This is an indication that there is no shortage of coal for power plants in the country
 jaiswal ne kaha ki kuch akhabaaron main kuchhek urja sanyantron par kam samay tak utpaadan ke liye hi koyala uplabdh hone kii baat kahi gai he
 Actually, such a situation arises due to over production of allocated capacity and many other reasons
 iske liye kol india ko dosha nahin diya janaa chahie
 Referring to the allocation of coal blocks, he said that after reviewing the current status of the blocks allocated since 1993 and their progress in the inter-ministerial inquiry, the allocation of 13 blocks has been canceled, while some have had their bank deposits forfeited

 He said on a question that under the 12th Five Year Plan, coal linkage and blocks have been given for all the concerned power plants of Uttar Pradesh
 tippaniyan Asked about the revelations by India Against Corruption leader Arvind Kejriwal regarding withdrawal of petroleum ministry from Jaipal Reddy, Jaiswal said that there is no use in commenting on futile allegations

 Additional Sessions Judge Nina Bansal Krishna told the police that the telephonic conversation (between the arrested accused) that you are referring to does not at all indicate that there is a match of match fixing in it

 There is no indication about match fixing

" ’aaropon ko tay karne ke sawaal par bahes ke dauraan mohan ne aropiyon ke bich telephone par hui baatcheet kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki ve log match phixing or sattebaaji main shaamil the

 Chinese President Xi Jinping will no longer retire in 2023
 china kii communist party ne samvidhan main raashtrapati or uparashtrapati ke liye mahaj paanch varsh ke do kaarykaal kii baadhyataa ko khatm karne kii pahal kar di he
 After the passage from parliament, Xi Jinping will be the world's most powerful leader after Mao Tse Tung in China's history
 haalanki china sarkaar kaa yah faisla beete teen-chaar dashakon kii us niti ko darkinar kar degaa jisane kisi ek vyakti ke haath main satta kaa kendriyakaran nahin hone diya
 Therefore, after this amendment proposed in the constitution, once again on the lines of Mao Tse Tung, power in China will be concentrated only in Xi Jinping
 kyon china main bana tha do kaarykaal kaa niyam?maao tse tung ke kaarykaal main china sarkaar kii jyadatiyon ko dekhte hue 1982 main china ke raashtrapati deng jiyoping ne samvidhan main sanshodhan kar donon raashtrapati or uparashtrapati ke kaarykaal ko simit karne kaa faisla liya
 Deng took this step so that no one person in the country could become a dictator like Mao Tse Tung
 phir kyon badla ja rahaa he ye kanoon?communist party apane is faisle se china main taanaashaahee ke khatre kaa koi zikr nahin kar he
 However, the verdict is believed to be the effect of President Xi Jinping's tenure as of now
 isse pehle shi jinping ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan desh ke samvidhan main apni raajnneeti vichaardhaara ko chhapavaya he
 Prior to Jinping, only Mao Tse Tung's political views were printed in the constitution
 ise padhein: china main jinping ke majboot hone se yun bad jaaengi PM modi kii chunautiyaan?lihaaja, is faisle se kaha ja saktaa he ki jinping china main apane raajnneetik kad ko badhaane ke liye yah kadam uthaa rahe hai
 In addition, there is a strong belief in China's political circles that during the last tenure, only the work of Xi Jinping was possible to strengthen China's reputation on the world stage and to advance the country with major economic reforms
 kya shi jinping honge china ke duusare maao tse tung?dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad ke itihaas main yah doosraa mauka hoga jab koi raashtrapati satta or shakti kaa ekmaatr kendra ban jaae
 Understanding Mao from China, at present, Xi Jinping said that any word is the law of the country
 shi jinping ne bhi maao kii tarj par party, sena or media ko nijee nishtha ke aadhaar par baandhne kii kavayad kii he jiske chalate lagbhag 30 dashak ke antaraal ke baad ek baar phir china main sabhi shaktiyaan unamem nihit hai
 Xi Jinping has himself been heard saying that his economic policies and domestic policies will have an impact in the next 50 years and with these, China will be able to become the world's biggest power
 shi ke is bayaan ko maujuuda china main maanane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he

 ab newjiland ke saath fivel team india khelegi bia austrailia iskaa faisla to guruuvar ko hi hoga
 But Satta Bazar has already decided the second team to reach the final
 wo team koun si he? team india yaa phir austrailia?guuruuvaar ko sidney main khele jane vaale world cap cricket ke duusare semifinal par ab puri duniya kii nigahen tiki hai
 It is a fact that in this match, on one side, the number one one-day team in the world is Australia, on the other hand the defending world champion Team India
 world cap 2015 ke is sabase hai profil match ko lekar ye divaangi sirf khel-khilaadi or cricket ke chaahanewaalon tak hi simit nahin
 Thousands of eyes are also focused on this game of that black world of crime, which the world knows as betting or betting
 ek mote anumaan ke mutabik sattebaazon ke liye shuru se hi centre for atraction rahi team india or mezbaan austrailia ke bich hone vaale akele isi match main duniya bhar main takreeban 5 hazaar karod rupye se bhi zyaada kaa satta lagaae jane kaa anumaan he
 Which is considered to be the largest amount in the history of betting in any match so far
 betting sindicket chalaanevaale arbapati dhandhebaazon ke saath har gend par hazaron kamaane or ganvaane vaale chote-mote panter bhi dil thame is mukaable kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 If you believe the sources related to the speculative market, then the price that the market has opened in favor of Australia for this match is 50-52
 matlab saaf he ki agar koi panter austrailia ke haq main ek rupye lagaataa he, to use austrailia ke jeetne par 50 rupye kaa phayda hona tay he, jabaki bharat ke haq main boli lagane par man mutabik nattejey par 52 rupye milane hai
 This mathematics of the betting world is enough to tell that in this second semi-final match of World Cup cricket, the world of betting is considering Australia as a favorite
 ye or baat he ki chunki ye muqabla kaante kaa he, bhav main sirf do rupye kaa hi fark he
 This is to say that Australia is undoubtedly a favorite in this match, the world of betting is not underestimating India either
 chunki ye is world cap kaa ab tak kaa sabase bada match he, bukis match shuru hone se pehle yaa shuru hone ke baad naa sirf apana bhav badal sakate hai, balki har gend, total score, vikets, pehle das gend or yahaan tak ki power play ke rizlts par bhi daanv khilne kii puri taiyaari main hai
 On Thursday, the online betting process will start with the toss on Thursday, it will continue till the last ball of the match
 peti yani hazaar rupye se chalanevaale satte ke is ganit ke bhi apane hi niyam or kaayade hai
 Although according to bookmakers, the entire bet will only go online, but in the middle of this game of online betting, Virat Kohli and Glenn Maxwell are at the top of the two players who can play the most bets
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki toss se lekar slog overs kii har gend par is baar satta bazaar ne karodon rupye idhar-udhar karne kii puri taiyaari kar rakhi he
 By the way, the betting was also in the quarter-final match played against India and Bangladesh, but then the price was 16 and 18
 is match main team india beshak fevorett thi, lekin bangladesh ke is world cap ke trek ricard ko dekhte hue bukis ne use bhi res main daal rakhaa tha
 If a match of a tournament worth Rs
 50 crores on the World Cup is worth 5 thousand crores, if the cost of that entire tournament reaches 50 thousand crores, then it should not be surprising
 itani badi rakam ke bare main sochna beshak atapata lagata ho, lekin satta bazaar main gyarahawein world cap cricket ko lekar jitna paisa lag rahaa he, wo apane aap main ricard he
 a big reason for this is the rain of runs this time too
 agar aisa nahin hota, to international cricket council is world cap ke aayojan ke liye jitne rupye kharch rahi he, usase kahin sau gune se bhi zyaada rakam sirf is event ke sahare chal rahi sattebaazi ke khel main nahin lage hote
 Believe it or not, but people who know the world of betting know that this tournament is being played around the world with a bet of 50 thousand crores rupees
 ye rakam us rakam se bhi sau guna zyaada he, jo isisi is gyarahawein world cap ko yojit karne main kharch kar rahaa he
 Rather, the truth is that the betting amount has increased more than two times compared to the previous World Cup
 yani pichhali baar jahaan world cap par duniya bhar main 20 hazaar karod rupye kaa satta khele jane kaa anumaan tha, vahiin is baar ye aankada 50 hazaar ko bhi paar kar gaya he
 In the Australia Cup match on 26th of the World Cup, not only will the bets be won not only on the win-win, but also on every ball, every run, every wicket, every catch and even no and wide ball
 Rupees are going to be from here to there
 iske alaava, mausam, toss or khilaadiyon ke nijee pradarshan tak par satorie daanv khel rahe hai

 If this crime is done by PM MA in 33 years, then why the applause
 kanhaiya kumaar bole ki agar koi bhi desh duusare deshon ke saath sambandh sthapit karnaa chahta he to uske liye international study kii jarurat he, JNU ekmaatr uniwarsity he jahaan par ye suvidha he
 Targeting the opponents of Best University every time, Kanhaiya Kumar said that if JNU is bad then why is it getting the Best University Award every year, the educated people are winning Nobel and are ministers in Modi government
 JNU kaa koi bhi chaatr ‘bharat tere tukade honge’ jaise bakawaas naare kaa samarthan nahin karata he
 On the fee hike, Kanhaiya said that some people want to destroy the entire university by making an example of just one thing
 aaj uniwarsity main 100 main se 40 aise chaatr hai jo badi hui fees ke saath padhai nahin kar sakate hai, yahaan koi khayraat main kuch nahin maang rahaa he balki test paas karke aae hai
 If fees increase in this way, it will become the most expensive university in the country
 raajnneetik vishleshak raghav avasthi ne is vivaad par kaha ki sarkaar JNU ke chaatro se nahin darati he, ye log lagaataar BJP kaa virodh karte hai
 He said that the people of the country want to ask why the tax readers want the fees not to be increased
 unhone sawaal kiya ki south africa par study karke desh ko kya phayda hoga
 Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari has targeted the Modi government, saying the government's response to Uri has been disappointing and the government has no concrete policy
 congress kaa maananaa he ki bharat ko paak ke bagaiyr hi saarc summit yojit karnaa chahie
 Manish Tiwari said that while Pakistan said that it will organize the 19th SAARC Summit without India, the Congress believes that instead of boycotting, India should organize in any other country except SAARC Summit Pakistan
 manish ne kaha ki uri hamale par sarkaar ke pratinidhi kah rahe the ki ham daant kaa jawaab jabada lekar denge
 Saying this, he reached the point that we will not participate in the SAARC Summit
 manish tiwari ne poocha ki sindhu jal samjhaute par kya faisla lenaa chaahati he sarkaar? kyonki ek din main nahin banataa baandh
 This is a long way, so what will the government do now? See this is the status of the most favorite country of Pakistan, it should be canceled as soon as possible
 congress pravaktaa ne kaha ki agar vaaki main pakistan kaa ravaiya badalanaa chaahati he sarkaar to bharat ko thos upaay sochane honge
 South Asia is the least integrated, there are big challenges, so decide carefully
 sarkaar ko lagata he ki paak isolated he to main ye sochataa hoon kii sarkaar apane khyaalon kii duniya main rah rahi he
 The reality is that the government is paralyzed and is being harmed daily
 mumbai kaa rahane vaala 27 varshiya shaks ne kuch aisa kiya jisaki charchaa duniya bhar main ho rahi he
 He wants to file a case against his parents
 use gussa he ki paidaa karne se pehle usase poocha kyon nahin gaya
 The news of Rafael Samuel has spread around the world that he is taking family members to court to produce
 unhone is kadam ko janvirohi bataaya

 Guardian kii khabar ke mutabik, rafel semual ne fasebuk par likhaa- 'main apane mata-pita se pyaar karata hum, lekin unhone aisa khud ke liye kiya
 'but now this post has been deleted

 He wrote - Why should i travel? Why should i work You happened for the reasons of others
 Latestly ko intervyuu dete hue unhone kaha- 'prasav prithvi par sabase maadak kaary he
 If you ask why he was born, he would say because we wanted to
 lekin jo baccha paidaa hua he or wo pidaa main he to wo cheez galat he
 People should not do this, why? Because human life is full of conflicts
 'buudhvaar kii subah rafel semual ne fasebuk post kiya
 In which his mother said something
 unhone likhaa- main rafel kii maa hum
 As a mother, it is my right to cleanse my son
 mere bete ne ye jaanate hue bhi court main le jane kii baat kahi ki ham donon hi vakil hai, is utaavlepan kii main prashansa karuungi
 If my son puts an intelligent argument in front of me, then i am willing to believe that it is my fault to produce

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii nyaay yojana par tippanee karne vaale niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh rajeev kumaar ne apana jawaab ayog ko de diya he
 Rajeev Kumar says that his comment was only as an economist, he was private, so do not consider it the idea of NITI Aayog
 rajeev kumaar ne apane bachaav main tathy rakhte hue yojana ayog ke purv upaadhyaksh montek singh ahaluwalia ke bayanon kaa bhi hawala diya
 He said Montek Singh Ahluwalia had commented on the 'gujarat model' in April 2014, while the code of conduct was still in force at the time
 ahaluwalia kii tippanee tab ke bhartiya janata party ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke vaadon par thi

e
, Justice Scheme, Rajiv Kumar had commented on this on his social media account
 rajeev kumaar ne twit kiya tha ki nyaay yojana to chand laakar dene jaisaa vaada he
 This impractical scheme will collapse the country's economy
 sarkari khajaane ko jo ghaataa hoga, use puraa nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 Many opposition parties objected to this tweet and complained to the Election Commission
 jiske baad ayog ne unhen notice jari karte hue jawaab maanga tha
 What is Rahul's justice scheme? Let me tell you that if Rahul Gandhi has promised that if his party comes to power, it will provide financial assistance of 72 thousand rupees annually to 20 percent of the poor of the country

 Applying this scheme can cost about Rs 3 lakh 60 thousand crore

 Union Minister Shashi Tharoor, who always targeted Sanrendra Modi, praised the work being done in Gujarat this time
 tharur ne twit kiya ki ek bhartiya hone ke naate, jab gujarat behatar kaary karata he, main garv mahasoos karata hum, vaise hi jaise kerala ke liye gauravanvit mahasoos karata hum
 This tweet was made by Tharoor after he received three National Tourism Awards for Gujarat Tourism

 Gujarat has won the award for Best Tourism Film, for innovative use of information and technology and for comprehensive development of tourism across the country
 is par pratikriya jaahir karte hue shashi tharur ne twit kiya ki main is par garv mahasoos karata hum
 This time, Tharoor has been critical of Modi's Raj
 This time Union Minister Shashi Tharoor has admittedly accepted the threat of Gujarat, but he has often targeted the Modi government of Gujarat earlier
 isi maheene 7 march ko shashi tharur ne twit kiya tha, yah sunakar acha laga he ki ahmedabad kaa vikaas 30 saal lambii prakriya se hua he, saaf he ki yah ek mukhyamantri kaa kaam nahin ho saktaa
 In this tweet, he directly attacked the claims of Narendra Modi, which have always patted the back of the Modi government for the development of Ahmedabad
 iske baad tharur ne ek twit karte hue kerala main pragati ke kuch galat aankade prastut kiye
 He wrote, note all those who say that Kerala is left behind: Kerala in 2011-12 9

 May all states pray for this way

 At the rate of 5 percent, there was progress in 2010-11, while Tharoor said that this rate is for 2011-12
 baad main unhone apni is galati ko kerala ke ek saasand ke sir madh diya
 Ageshi Tharoor from Gujarat Kerala often compares Gujarat to Kerala

 saurav ne kaha ki abhi unhone is sting ko puri tarah se nahin dekha he, pehle main puri jaankaree luungaa
 But if this happened then it is quite wrong
 bhajji bole- ye sharmnaak harkatbhartiya cricketer harbhajan singh ne is khulaase par kaha ki ye sharmnaak he, aise logon ko cricket se dur rakhana chahie
 Because of such people, cricket has been smeared, it is their failure, not just theirs
 camere par kya bolaa pich curator?'aaj tak' ke camere main pune ke pich curator pandurang salgamvakar ne pich kii taiyaari ko lekar gopneey jaankaree camere ke saamne ujagar kii
 Please tell that on Wednesday, the match between India and New Zealand is to be played in Pune
 reporter ne pich curator se apane do playeron ke liye pich main kuch badlaav ke liye kaha, jisapar pandurang ek dam raji ho gaye
 The pitch curator said that the pitch we have prepared can score up to 337 runs
 jise aaraam se chez kiya ja saktaa he
 Pandurang also agreed to show him the pitch at the reporter's behest, while according to the rules, nobody can go on the pitch before the match except for the captain and coach

 He also allowed him to go on the pitch wearing wedged shoes

 They have told that because it is an international match, the Anti Corruption Unit of AICC is watching it
 iskaa notice liya he isaki jaanch ho rahi he
 Right now the match is up to the referee whether to match in the same peach or get it done on another pitch
 'match radd hone par rajeev shukla kaa kahana he ki match radd nahin ho saktaa
 At most, he will see that if there is something wrong in the middle of it, if there is a mess, then he can get another match in the middle, then he can change the wicket because one ground also has many wickets
 mujhe nahin lagata ki isamen koi or shaamil hoga
 But investigations are on
 jaach shuru kar di he anti karpshan urine report ke aadhaar par karrwai hogi
 All this action will take place after the investigation of the Anti Corruption Unit of the ICC

 Rajeev Shukla says that but it has been talked about keeping the translation completely
 bisisiai secretary ne us par amal kiya jayega
 There will be no difference in the result of this match
 netherland ke hegg sthit international court of justise ne kulbhushan jadhav kii faansee par roak laga di he
 Pakistan will now also have to provide counselor access
 pakistan se kaha gaya he ki vah apane faisle kii samiksha kare or punarvichaar kare
 There were differences between the two countries on 8 points
 ek bindu par sabhi 16 jajon ne vot kiya jisamen pakistan ke bhi jaj shaamil the
 15 judges in 16 have ruled in favor of India on the remaining seven points
 pakistan ke jaj ne khilaaf main mat diya
 After hearing the allegations leveled by both the parties, the court has ordered in a sequential manner
 sirf faansee kii sazaa par roak nahin lagi he balki kai binduon par pakistan ko galat paaya gaya he
 For example, the court rejected Pakistan's charge that India was not giving evidence of Kulbhushan Jadhav being an Indian
 court ne kaha ki pakistan or bharat donon hi kulbhushan jadhav ko bhartiya maanate hai isliye saboot kii koi zarurat nahin he
 The Court of India also turned down three of the four requests
 bharat ne court se maang kii thi ki pakistan kii military court ke faisle ko radd kiya jaae
 Pakistan should be ordered to quash the decision of the Military Court and send Jadhav to safe India
 court ne ise nahin mana
 But the court has rejected Pakistan's attitude and pleas on many points
 court ne kaha ki pakistan kaa yah aarope ki bharat ne is maamle ko antarrashtriya court main laakar prakriyaaon kaa durupyog kiya he
 Therefore, the court should reject this request of India
 court ne ise sweekaar nahin kiya
 The court also said that Pakistan did not inform Jadhav of his rights after his arrest which he should have done
 yahi nahin jadhav kii giraftaar ke teen hafte ke bheetar bharat ko soochna deni chahie thi
 Pakistan did not do so
 pakistan ne counslar acces nahin dekar adhikaron kaa ulanghan kiya he
 In this way, the court said that it is the responsibility of Pakistan not to do the wrong thing which it has been doing according to international standards and inform Jadhav about his rights
 isamen deree nahin honi chahie
 The Counselor Officer of India should be allowed to meet Jadhav so that he can provide legal assistance to Jadhav
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha he ki ham is faisle kaa swaagat karte hai
 Truth and justice have won
 tathyon ke aadhaar par faisla dene ke liye isije ko badhai
 i trust that Jadhav will get justice
 hamaari sarkaar sabhi bharatiyon kii suraksha or kalyaan ke liye hameshaa kaam karti rahegi
 Former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has welcomed and also congratulated the Prime Minister
 bharat kii taraf se vakil harish salve ek rupee kii fees par yah cese lard rahe the
 India filed the suit in the International Court of Justice on 8 May 2017
 18 may 2017 ko court ne antim faisla aane tak faansee kii sazaa par roak laga di thi
 Pakistan obeyed the order and stayed the execution of the sentence
 pakistan kii sabase badi daleel thi ki jo vyakti jasusi karte hue pakadaa jayega us par vienna kanvension kaa artical 36 lagu nahin hoga
 India argued that there is no exemption in the Vienna Convention
 court ne kaha ki bharat ne 1969 ke vienna kanvension ke lau of treety kaa party nahin he
 Pakistan signed in 1970 but did not implement it
 court ne apane hisaab se matlab nikaala or pakistan kii daleel ko khaarij kar diya
 India has called this decision a big victory
 raksha mantri rajnath singh ne ise bharat kii badi jeet bataaya he
 Former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj also tweeted several
 pradhanmantri modi ko badhai di or ise bharat kii badi jeet bataai
 Sushma Swaraj also congratulated lawyer Harish Salve for this case
 salve maatr ek rupee kii fees par yah cese lard rahe the
 The execution of the sentence was stayed
 kulbhushan ko counslar acces milegaa or use kanoonee sahaayta bhi milegi
 But this decision is also being welcomed in Pakistan
 pakistan kii media kaa kahana he ki international court ne military court ke faisle ko radd nahin kiya
 Paragraph 137 should be read on page number 37 of the judgment
 bharat ne court se kaha ki military court ke faisle ko radd kar de
 Transfer it to civil court
 court ne nahin mana he
 Only said that the decision to hang
 court ne kaha he ki vienna kanvension kaa ulanghan hua he iske liye ek maatr rasta he ki faisle ko radd kar diya jaae
 Partially or wholly
 matlab yah hua ki agar vienna kanvation kaa ulanghan hua he to uski samiksha hogi
 It should also be considered a relief
 faisle ke 145wein paragraph main jajon ne likhaa he ki pakistan ke vakil ne aashwaasan diya he ki jadhav ko free and fere trial milegaa
 This is the foundation of the constitution of Pakistan
 nyaayik faisle kii samiksha hoti he
 For this, Pakistan cited the decision of the Peshawar High Court of 2018 that several basic cases can be interfered with the decision of the Military Court
 pehla jab koi pramaan na ho, doosraa, saboot paryaapt na ho, teesraa military court apane adhikaar kshetra se baahar gaya ho or chauthaa kanoon or tathyon kii galat vyakhya
 The High Court can overturn the decision of the Military Court in these four cases
 international court ne ne apane faisle main kaha ki kisi bhi faisle kii samiksha yaa punarvichaar ke maamle main free and fere trial ke siddhanton kaa aadar karnaa padataa he
 The court considers that cases of violation of Jadhav's rights will be considered during the review and review
 pej number 39 ke paragram 146 main yah bhi likhaa he ki yah pakistan par nirbhar karegaa ki faisle kii samiksha or punarvichaar kaa vah koun sa tarika apanaataa he
 Review and reconsideration can be done in several ways
 aisa bhi nahin he ki tarika chunane ke vikalp kii azaadi manamaane tareeke se mili hui he
 Kulbhushan Yadav was arrested by Pakistan in March 2016 on charges of espionage
 bharat ne ise kabhi sweekaar nahin kiya
 a year later, Pakistan's military court sentenced him to death
 pakistan kaa kahana tha ki uski sena ne jadhav ko baluchistan se giraftaar kiya tha
 Jadhav was trying to sneak into Iran from Pakistan
 bharat kaa kahana he ki iran se jadhav ko agava kiya gaya tha
 Jadhav left for his business after retiring from the Navy
 farvari main bhi pulavama aatanki hamale ke aas-paas is maamle main sunwaayee hui thi
 India had alleged that Jadhav was being made a pawn so that he could avoid the charge of supporting terror
 bharat china kaa naam bahut flash ho rahaa he ki china ke jaj ne bhi vot daalaa
 With this we lighten our own success
 china kaa naam alag se rekhaankit karne se aisa lagata he ki jajon ne apana faisla antarrashtriya kootneeti ke aadhaar par diya he
 Whereas this decision has been given on the basis of international law and tradition
 bharat ne yah jeet court ke bheetar apni behtareen kanoonee taiyaariyon ke dam par hasil kii he
 India and Pakistan also had judges in 16 judges
 pakistan ke jaj ne alag mat diya
 Thankfully no one is taking the name of India like China in such a way that the judge of India voted in favor of India
 china ke alaava 16 jajon main somalia, slovakia, france morocco, brazil, america, italy, uganda, jamaica, australia, rus, lebanon, japan ke bhi jaj shaamil the
 All these names should also be taken with respect
 insaaf kahin bhi ho, bharat se lekar duniya main kahin bhi, acha hi lagata he
 Today's happiness also includes this thing
 faisle kii kapi ek hi he
 It is available in India and also in Pakistan through the Internet
 magar donon mulkon kii khabaron main alag alag chizon par jor he
 As Don News has written in its headline that the ICJ turned down India's demand to return Jadhav but gave counselor access
 magar khabar ke bheetar faansee kii sazaa par roak kii baat likhi gai he
 The Express Tribune has written that the ICJ turned down the demand to acquit Jadhav and send him back
 pakistan main jor he ki bharat kii maang thukraa di gai he duusari taraf bharat ke akhbaar hindu kii hedline he ki court ne pakistan se sazaa kii samiksha ke liye kaha
 The Indian Express has written that the court gave counselor access to India, asking Pakistan to review the hanging
 is faisle par pakistan kii aadhikarik pratikriya nahin ai he
 Today, Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai attack in Pakistan, was arrested
 pakistan ke counter teror department ne hafiz said ko giraftaar kiya or use anti terarism court main pesh kiya gaya
 Has been sent to jail hafiz said ke sanghathan par aatanki gatividhiyon main vittiya madad kaa aarope he
 This decision of Pakistan has been welcomed by US President Trump
 apane twit main kaha he ki 'mumbai hamale ke 10 saal baad tathakthith master mind hafiz said ko pakistan main arest kar liya gaya he
 Pressure was created for two years to find it
 'isaki vyakhya kaise kii jaae
 Trump is talking about his pressure on Pakistan or telling the victory of India or Pakistan wants to get closer to America again with these steps
 yaa america phir se pakistan ke kareeb aana chahta he
 There are many arguments
 aapako bas ye yaad dilaa den ki march 2019 main sanyukt raashtra ne hafiz said kii apil ko riject kar diya tha ki uskaa naam pratibandhit sanghathan kii suchi se hataaya jaae
 But then Pakistan did not defend Hafiz Saeed
 may 2019 main sanyukt raashtra ne masood azhar ko global aatanki suchi main daal diya tha
 In December 2008, the Security Council of the United Nations had named Hafiz Saeed in the list of international terrorists after the Mumbai attack

 Rajeshwar Singh, the head of the rss-affiliated proselytizing organization Dharm Jagran Manch, is now a witness in both the blast cases
 gaur talab he ki dharmantaran ke mudde par desh bhar main bavaal machaa hua he
 Rajeshwar Singh first made his statement in connection with the May 2007 Mecca Masjid blast case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and then recorded his statement to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on the delhi-lahore Samjhauta Express blast case in February 2007

 He says that "since about 60 per cent of the Muslims in the district are Rajputs, who had converted to religion, they came back to a (negative) reaction when they decided to rethink them
" ” yah puche jane par ki unhen kisne roka, rajeshwar singh ne bachaav main kaha, “is bare main khulaasa karnaa thik nahin
 The field preacher told me directly
 unhone mujhase kaha ki kaaphi dabaav he, isliye abhi isko chhod do

 haalanki asaram ke bete narayan sai ne daawa kiya ki unke pita opium kaa seven nahin karte
 Prajapati said that Asaram used to cultivate opium himself at the Panchred Ashram, 17 km from Ratlam and used to ask for opium from there
 asaram ke ashram ke logon kaa kahana he ki prajapati asaram ke khilaaf aarope isliye laga rahe hai kyonki baapu ne unhen apane ashram se nikaal diya tha
