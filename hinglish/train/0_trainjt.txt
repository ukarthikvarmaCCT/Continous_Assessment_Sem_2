 President of the Press Council of India Markandey Katju has written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh suggesting to him that electronic media should also be brought under the purview of the Council and the body should be given more powers

 Justice Katju said, 'indian media too often plays an anti-people role
 vah aksar janata kaa dhyaan un vaastavik samasyaon se hataa detaa he jo buniyadi rup se aarthik samasyaayein hoti hai
 "justice Katju said," 80 per cent of the people are living with extreme poverty, unemployment, inflation and healthcare related problems
 aap (media) in samasyaon se unka dhyaan banta dete hai
 You present film stars and fashion parades as if this is the public's problem
 ’unhone thapar se kaha, ‘cricket janata ke liye nashe kii tarah he

 This is the most painful and painful period in history

 During the interview, he said, 'the media here promotes superstition and astrology

 Justice Katju said, "shouldn't the media uplift them and should they not be a part of enlightened India
" yaa phir media ko unhen unke str par hi chhod dena chaiye or unke pichhadepan ko banaaye rakhana chaiye
 a former Supreme Court judge said, 'many TV channels show astrology which is purely a sham

 shahrukh apane agle project kii ghoshnaa kab karenge ye jaanane ke liye phans kaaphi excited hai lekin pichhali teen filmein flop ho jane ke baad shahrukh ne abhi koi project nahin uthaane kaa tay kiya he
 Recently, there were reports that Shahrukh Katrina Kaif will soon be seen in Ali Abbas Zafar's film
 ab shahrukh in khabaron par pratikriya di he
 Shah Rukh said in a tweet, "it is always nice to know that in my absence and behind my back, i always sign films in a supernatural way that i don't even know about
 ladakon or ladakiyon, main filmein tab karata hum jab main khud ye baat kahuun ki main ye film karne vaala hum
 
 
 Apart from this, everything is untrue
 "it’s always nice to know that in my absence & behind my back , i have surreptitiously signed so many films that even i am not aware of!! Boys & girls i do a film when i say i am doing it
 
 
 
 otherwise it’s just post truth
 - Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) September 8, 2019 Apparently, Shah Rukh has denied all such news in one of his tweets, in which Shah Rukh Khan was talking about Ali Abbas Zafar's film signing
 bataa den ki kuch media reports main aisa kaha gaya tha ki shahrukh khan katrina caff ke saath ek film karne ja rahe hai
 This will be his third film with Katrina
 shahrukh khan is vakt sirf production main dhyaan laga rahe hai
 He has made a film with Amitabh after Zero flopped and his web series Bard of Blood has also been announced on Netflix

 On the issue of Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin, she rebelled from Congress in 1999 and said goodbye to Tariq Anwar, who formed Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) along with Sharad Pawar
 itnaa hi nahin unhone loksabhaa sadsy pad se bhi istipha de diya he
 In such a situation, it is now believed that he can return to the Congress once again
 sutron kii maane to tarik anwar congress main apana bhavishya dekh rahe hai
 In view of this, he has resigned from NCP
 biharka katihaar loksabhaa kshetra tarik anwar kii karmbhumi rahi he
 He has been fighting and winning elections from this parliamentary seat
 ensipi chhodane kaa rafel bana bahanacongress ke paas bihar main koi bada cheharaa nahin he
 In such a situation, the statement of Sharad Pawar on Rafael issue gives the basis for Tariq Anwar to leave the party
 tarik anwar ne kaha, sharad pavaar kaa rafel par diya gaya bayaan mujhe thik nahin laga
 The explanation given by NCP was not correct
 pavaar ne jab bayaan diya tha to khud unako safai deni chahie thi
 Although there was no explanation from his side, i resigned
 ghar vaapasi ke peeche chhipi he siyasatensipi chhodane ke baad kis party main jaaenge is sawaal par tarik anwar ne kaha ki ye abhi tay nahin he
 i will decide after talking to the supporters
 iske baad bataaunga

 bihar main congress apane aadhaar ko majboot karne kii koshish main juty he, lekin party ke paas rajya main koi bada cheharaa nahin he
 In such a situation, Tariq Anwar sees his political future safe in Congress
 wo 'ghar vaapasi' kar bihar main congress kaa bada cheharaa bananaa chaahate hai
 He had already decided to leave NCP
 ensipi main unke or party ke netaa prafull patel ke bich rishte behatar nahin rahe hai
 Since the 2014 elections, the two leaders have held different views in party meetings at various times
 aise aaerahul gandhike karibacongress main rahul gandhi ke kad badhane ke baad se hi tarik anwar 'ghar vaapasi' karne ke jugat main the
 Tariq Anwar was looking for a return to Congress since 2016
 notebandi ke baad rahul gandhi ne jab pehali press conference karne utre the, tab tarik anwar der se pahunche the
 In such a situation, Rahul asked Jyotiraditya Scindia, sitting next to him, to leave the seat for Tariq Anwar
 is ghatana ke baad se rahul se unki nazdikiyaan badhin
 In the articles published in Tariq Anwar's Urdu newspaper for the last two years, he was quite soft about the Congress
 itnaa hi nahin wo rahul gandhi kii kaaryastylee kii tarif bhi karte rahe hai
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Tariq Anwar had two months ago called Rahul Gandhi the face of the Prime Minister's post on behalf of the opposition in 2019
 jabaki sharad pavaar ne kaha tha ki abhi vipaksh kaa cheharaa tay nahin he
 Political journey of Tariq Anwar Tariq Anwar started his political journey in the context of Sitaram Kesari
 1977 main katihaar loksabhaa seat se congress ummidavaar ke taur par chunaav maidan main utre, lekin wo jeet nahin paae
 He won the Parliament after three years in 1980
 iske baad 1985 main dobaaraa jeet hasil kii
 Tariq Anwar became increasingly into politics

 In 1988, he became the National President of the Congress Seva Dal
 1989 main ve bihar pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh bane or 1993 main congress ke alpsankhyak cell ke rashtriya adhyaksh bane
 Tariq Anwar was elected to Parliament for the third time in 1996 and became political secretary to the then Congress President PV Narasimha Rao
 iske baad congress ke adhyaksh seetaram kesari bane to tarik anwar ko 1997 main congress varking cameti ke sadsy chunaa gaya
 In 1998, Tariq Anwar again won the Lok Sabha elections
 sonia ke chalate kii thi congress se baghawat1999 main congress kii kaman jab sonia gandhi ne sanbhali to sharad pavaar, tarik anwar or pie sangama ne party se bagavaat kar di thi
 These three leaders had made the foreign origin of Sonia Gandhi an issue
 iske baad teenon netaaon ne milakar ensipi kaa gathan kiya tha
 However, later when the UPA formed the government at the Center, the NCP came with the Congress
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ve ek baar phir se chunaav jitkar manmohan singh sarkaar main krishi or food processing industries ke rajyamantri bane

 dilli se sate faridabad main bijepi yuva morcha ke adhyaksh anuraag thakur ne khud logon ko chaay banti
 BJP has decided to impose such a chaupal in different cities of the country at intervals of five-five days
 party kaa maananaa he ki log is abhiyaan se judakar chaay kii chuskiyon ke saath sidhe-sidhe modi se rubaru ho sakenge
 The party is trying to discuss BJP and Modi in every street, locality and shops of the country before the elections
 bijepi ne is abhiyaan ke tahat kareeb do karod logon se judane kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Modi is currently benefiting from the 'political tea' served by Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar and that is why he is trying to connect himself with the lower sections of society by throwing a wide chest of tea chawls everywhere

 haalanki isse pehle se fasebuk massenger main paise bhejne kaa feechar he jo limited he
 According to the report, Facebook is soon going to test the red envelope feature under which users will be able to send money on this platform
 iske alaava ek doosraa feechar ‘braking news’ aa saktaa he or isaki bhi testing shuru hogi
 According to a report by The Next Web, both of these features were first reported by this portal
 braking newstag news publishars ke liye jari kiya ja saktaa he jiske tahat news websites fasebuk ke par logon ko aas paas main ho rahi braking news se avgat kara saken
 According to a Recode report, Facebook has confirmed that the company is going to start testing the breaking news feature in the coming time
 haalanki fasebuk ne iske bare main zyada jaankaree dene se manaa kiya he
 With this, the company has not said anything about the red envelope, nor has it declined
 ricode ne fasebuk ke ek pratinidhi kaa bayaan publish kiya he jisamen unhone kaha he, ‘fasebuk hameshaa nae product experience kii testing karata rahata he, lekin is samay is khaas fitures ke bare main baat nahin kii ja sakati he’haalanki aisa kai baar hua jab fasebuk kuch feechar ko testing ke dauraan hikhatm kar detaa he
 Therefore, it is difficult to say how long these two features, named Red envelope and breaking news, will come on Facebook

 "it may be known that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday expressed 'deep disappointment' over Hazare's decision to go on a fast but said he respected social activists and their campaign a lot
" hajaare ne poocha, "pradhanmantri kaa kahana he ki vah mujhamen vishwaas karne ke saath hi meraa sammaan karte hai

 ise karthik subbaraaj ne diarect kiya he
 Petta is released in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu languages
 kaha jaataa he ki sahitya kii tarah cinema kaa bhi samaaj par gaharaa asar padataa he
 Cinema inspires and educates us and sometimes gives a sweet, touching message
 kuch isi tarah dil ko chhu lene vaali short film he 'jai hind' jisamen manoj bajpai or ravina tandon mukhya bhoomika main hai
 The film is part of a campaign to remember martyrs in which Manoj Bajpai and Raveena Tandon worked together after 14 years
 issort filmake main aazaadee kii ahmiyat ko samajhane kii koshish kii gai he
 In this 6-minute film, Manoj Bajpai has filled his life with his acting
 aap bhi dekhen yah khubasurat film
 The continuous Chinese help to Pakistan has now made the country angry on the one hand, on the other hand, people have now decided to teach China a lesson
 dilachasp baat yah he ki china ko sabak sikhaane ke liye ab logon ne maid in china vastuon kaa bahishkaar karne kaa faisla kar liya he
 In the village court of Obra Panchayat in Aurangabad district of Bihar, it has been ruled that from now onwards 10,000 population of panchayat will not use Made in China items
 bharat dwaara pakistan par kiye sargical strike ke kuch din baad yah gram panchayat baithi or sarvasammati se faisla liya gaya kii panchayat ke tahat tamaam gaanv main chines vastuon ke kharidne or bechney par pabandi laga di jaae
 The main objective of this decision is to break the back of the economy
 gram panchayat ne apane faisle main yah bhi kaha agar koi vyakti is aadesh kii avhelnaa karegaa to uske upar jurmaana bhi lagaaya jayega
 Village head of Obra Panchayat Gudiya Devi said that the manner in which China continuously helps Pakistan, people here are very angry and it has been decided that there will be no sale of Chinese goods in Obra Panchayat
 vahiin duusari ore bhagalpur jila prashasan ne bhi apni taraf se farmaan jari kiya he ki is baar diwali main kisi bhi prakaar ke chines pataakhe naa beche jaaenge naa kharide jaaenge
 On the other hand, the Bihar government, while issuing advisory, has asked all the districts to stop giving firecrackers of type during Diwali
 bhagalpur jiladhikari aadesh teerthamare ne kaha ki hamen bihar sarkaar kii taraf se ek adwijuri mili he or usee adwijuri ke aadhaar par jile main pataakhe kii bikri or kharid par roak lagane kaa nirdesh diya he
 The Congress has accused Mamata Banerjee of betrayal on her presidential candidature and has approached Biman Bose and Buddhadeb Bhattacharya in an attempt to garner support from the Left
 sutron ke mutabik vittamantri or raashtrapati pad kii daud main shaamil pranab mukherjee ne donon netaaon se phone par baatcheet kii he
 NCP chief Sharad Pawar was among those who met Sonia Gandhi on Thursday evening
 mulaakaat ke baad pavaar ne kaha ki vah upie pratyaashee ke samarthan main hi matdaan karenge
 Now it is clear that which candidate will field UPA in the presidential election, it will be decided in the UPA meeting on Friday
 aaj shaam congress party ke kor group kii baithak aahut kii gai he jisamen mamata banerjee kii nai chaal ke baad utpann paristhiti par charchaa kii jaaegi
 It is believed that the Congress's attempt to put the Left in its custody could further dent its relationship with Mamata Banerjee, as the Left is Mamata's biggest political enemy in West Bengal
 pradhanmantri ke saath baithak ke baad pranab mukherjee ne mediakarmiyon ko bataaya ki congress jald hi apane pratyaashee ke naam kii ghoshnaa karegi
 Earlier, rejecting the names suggested by Mamta and Mulayam about the presidential candidate, the Congress has made it clear that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will complete his term till 2014 and the party has not fixed a single name
 party pravaktaa janardan dvivedi ne patrakaron ko bataaya ki trinmul pramukh or sapa pramukh dwaara pradhanmantri dow manmohan singh ko raashtrapati pad kaa pratyaashee banaae jane kaa suzav maan lene kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota, kyonki party ne janata se vaada kiya tha ki 2014 tak dow singh hi pradhanmantri bane rahenge
 With this, it was clear from Dwivedi that the Congress is in the mood to nominate one of Pranab and Ansari and APJ Abdul Kalam and Somnath Chatterjee will not join his choice
 koun banegaa raashtrapati or koun banayega raashtrapati? ye donon sawaal ab behad ahm ho gaye hai
 On Wednesday, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav's political moves have changed the entire strategy
 is puure masale par kai tarah ke sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 For example, did mamata-mulayam not even think it necessary to talk to Kalam, Manmohan and Somnath Chatterjee before presenting them for the presidency? Did the Congress not feel it necessary to stand with its Prime Minister and say that under pressure from anyone, she was not going to replace Manmohan Singh? Will other parties also join mulayam-mamta's initiative? Will the Congress now bargain with Mulayam and Mamata and will some new names come out for the presidential election? sawaalon kaa yah silsilaa yaheen khatm nahin hota, lekin is bich guuruuvaar subah pranab mukherjee ne sonia gandhi ke saath unke awaas par mulaakaat kii
 In this meeting which lasted for 20 minutes, Defense Minister AK Antony was also present and later P
 Chidambaram also reached 10, Janpath
 isi mudde par shaam ko congress kor cameti kii bhi ahm baithak hone vaali he
 Till now, Pranab da was the only presidential candidate from the cabinet, but mamta-mulayam brought him in front of his own Prime Minister in a jolt
 lekin baat sirf itani hi nahin he
 If Manmohan Singh's name catches on for the presidency, it means that the Congress will have to choose a new Prime Minister
 congress party main pranab se behatar iskaa daavedaar or koun ho saktaa he
 
 
 So today, two contenders for the post of President and perhaps Prime Minister will be face to face
 aise main cabinet baithak kaa maahaul tanaav bharaa ho saktaa he
 At least this is what non-congress parties would want
 vaise agar in donon kii marji chale, to pranab mukherjee raashtrapati bhawan janaa chahenge or pradhanmantri saat res course road nahin chhodana chahenge
 The comments dilachasp yah he ki mulaayam or mamata ne jo teen naam raashtrapati pad ke liye pesh kiye unase pehle baat karne kii jarurat hi nahin samajhi
 Somnath Chatterjee, who was the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, told NDTV clearly that he has not spoken to any political party
 unhone kaha, mujhe yah bhi nahin pataa ki mamata or mulaayam ne kin vajahon se mere naam kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 However, i feel honored to offer my name
 udhar, manmohan singh ne bhi kaha ki vah jahaan hai, khush hai
 On the other hand, the BJP has accused the UPA of differences over the presidential candidate
 ensipi netaa sharad pavaar kaa kahana he ki sabhi partiyon ke bich sahmati banane kii jarurat he
 Biju Janata Dal leader Jai Panda has said that he stands for PA Sangma only for the presidential candidature
 left ke netaa di raja ne kaha he ki abhi naamon ko lekar sirf atakalein hai, jab tak koi ek naam saamne nahin aata, left koi faisla nahin legaa
 NCP chief Sharad Pawar was among those who met Sonia Gandhi on Thursday evening

 left ke netaa di raja ne kaha he ki abhi naamon ko lekar sirf atakalein hai, jab tak koi ek naam saamne nahin aata, left koi faisla nahin legaa
 a meeting of the core group of the Congress party has been convened this evening in which the situation arising after Mamata Banerjee's new move will be discussed
 mana ja rahaa he ki left ko apane paale main karne kii congress kii koshish se mamata banerjee ke saath rishte main or khatas paidaa ho sakati he, kyonki pashchim bengal main mamata kaa sabase bada raajnneetik dushman left hi he
 After the meeting with the Prime Minister, Pranab Mukherjee told media persons that the Congress would soon announce the name of its candidate
 isse pehle, raashtrapati pratyaashee ke bare main mamata or mulaayam dwaara sujhaaye gaye naamon ko khaarij karte hue congress ne saaf kiya he ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh 2014 tak kaa apana kaarykaal puraa karenge or party ne abhi koi ek naam tay nahin kiya he
 Party spokesperson Janardan Dwivedi told reporters that there is no question of accepting the suggestion of the Trinamool chief and SP chief to make Prime Minister Dr
 Manmohan Singh a presidential candidate, as the party had promised the public that by 2014, Dr
 Singh Only the Prime Minister will continue
 iske saath hi dvivedi kii baton se saaf ho gaya ki congress pranab or ansaari main se hi kisi ek ko pratyaashee banane ke mood main he or apije abdul kalam tathaa somnath chatarji uski pasand main shaamil nahin honge
 Who will be the president and who will be the president? Both these questions have become very important now
 buudhvaar ko raashtrapati pad kii ummidavaari par trinmul congress pramukh mamata banerjee or sapa supremeo mulaayam singh yadav ne jo siyaasi chaal chali he, usase puri ranneeti hi badal gai he
 Many questions are being raised on this whole issue
 masalan, kya kalam, manmohan or somnath chatarji kaa naam raashtrapati pad ke liye pesh karne se pehle mamata−mulaayam ne inase baat karnaa bhi zaruri nahin samajha? kya congress ko yah jaruri nahin laga ki vah apane pradhanmantri ke saath khadi ho or kahe ki kisi ke dabaav main vah manmohan singh ko badalane nahin ja rahi he? kya mulaayam−mamata kii pahal ke saath duusari partiyaan bhi judengi? kya congress ab nae sire se mulaayam−mamata se moltol karegi or kya ab raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar kuch nae naam saamne aaenge? This series of questions does not end here, but in the meantime, on Thursday morning, Pranab Mukherjee met Sonia Gandhi at her residence
 20 minute tak chali is baithak main rakshaamantri eke antni bhi maujuud the or baad main pi chidambaram bhi 10, janpath par pahunche
 The Congress Core Committee is also going to have an important meeting in the evening on this issue
 ab tak cabinet se pranab da raashtrapati pad ke iklaute ummidavaar the, lekin mamata-mulaayam ne ek jatke main unhen apane hi pradhanmantri ke saamne laa khadaa kiya
 But this is not the only thing
 agar manmohan singh kaa naam raashtrapati pad ke liye jor pakad letaa he, to iskaa matlab he ki congress ko ek nayaa pradhanmantri chunanaa padegaa
 Who else can be a better candidate than Pranab in the Congress party? 
 
 to aaj raashtrapati pad or shaayad pradhanmantri pad ke do−do daavedaar aamane-saamne honge
 In such a situation, the atmosphere of the cabinet meeting can be tense
 kam se kam gaiyr−congressi dal to yahi chaahate honge
 By the way, if these two wish, then Pranab Mukherjee would like to go to Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Prime Minister would not like to leave the Seven Race Course Road
 tippaniyan Interestingly, the three names that Mulayam and Mamata presented for the presidency did not seem necessary to talk to them first
 loksabhaa ke adhyaksh rahe somnath chatarji ne enditivi se saaf kaha ki unki kisi bhi rajnatik dal se baat nahin hui he
 He said, i do not even know for what reasons Mamta and Mulayam proposed my name
 haalanki apane naam ke prastaav se main khud ko sammanit mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 On the other hand, Manmohan Singh also said that he is happy where he is
 udhar, bijepi ne raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ko lekar upie main hi matbhed kaa aarope lagaaya he
 NCP leader Sharad Pawar says that there needs to be a consensus among all parties
 biju janata dal ke netaa jai pandas ne kaha he ki raashtrapati pad kii ummidavaari ke liye vah pie sangama ke naam par hi kaayam hai
 Left leader d Raja has said that there is only speculation about names, until one name comes up, the left will not take any decision
 mana ja rahaa he ki left ko apane paale main karne kii congress kii koshish se mamata banerjee ke saath rishte main or khatas paidaa ho sakati he, kyonki pashchim bengal main mamata kaa sabase bada raajnneetik dushman left hi he

 masalan, kya kalam, manmohan or somnath chatarji kaa naam raashtrapati pad ke liye pesh karne se pehle mamata−mulaayam ne inase baat karnaa bhi zaruri nahin samajha? kya congress ko yah jaruri nahin laga ki vah apane pradhanmantri ke saath khadi ho or kahe ki kisi ke dabaav main vah manmohan singh ko badalane nahin ja rahi he? kya mulaayam−mamata kii pahal ke saath duusari partiyaan bhi judengi? kya congress ab nae sire se mulaayam−mamata se moltol karegi or kya ab raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar kuch nae naam saamne aaenge? This series of questions does not end here, but in the meantime, on Thursday morning, Pranab Mukherjee met Sonia Gandhi at her residence
 20 minute tak chali is baithak main rakshaamantri eke antni bhi maujuud the or baad main pi chidambaram bhi 10, janpath par pahunche
 The Congress Core Committee is also going to have an important meeting in the evening on this issue
 ab tak cabinet se pranab da raashtrapati pad ke iklaute ummidavaar the, lekin mamata-mulaayam ne ek jatke main unhen apane hi pradhanmantri ke saamne laa khadaa kiya
 But this is not the only thing
 agar manmohan singh kaa naam raashtrapati pad ke liye jor pakad letaa he, to iskaa matlab he ki congress ko ek nayaa pradhanmantri chunanaa padegaa
 Who else can be a better candidate than Pranab in the Congress party? 
 
 to aaj raashtrapati pad or shaayad pradhanmantri pad ke do−do daavedaar aamane-saamne honge
 In such a situation, the atmosphere of the cabinet meeting can be tense
 kam se kam gaiyr−congressi dal to yahi chaahate honge
 By the way, if these two wish, then Pranab Mukherjee would like to go to Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Prime Minister would not like to leave the Seven Race Course Road
 tippaniyan Interestingly, the three names that Mulayam and Mamata presented for the presidency did not seem necessary to talk to them first
 loksabhaa ke adhyaksh rahe somnath chatarji ne enditivi se saaf kaha ki unki kisi bhi rajnatik dal se baat nahin hui he
 He said, i do not even know for what reasons Mamta and Mulayam proposed my name
 haalanki apane naam ke prastaav se main khud ko sammanit mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 On the other hand, Manmohan Singh also said that he is happy where he is

 Left leader d Raja has said that there is only speculation about names, until one name comes up, the left will not take any decision
 isse pehle, raashtrapati pratyaashee ke bare main mamata or mulaayam dwaara sujhaaye gaye naamon ko khaarij karte hue congress ne saaf kiya he ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh 2014 tak kaa apana kaarykaal puraa karenge or party ne abhi koi ek naam tay nahin kiya he
 Party spokesperson Janardan Dwivedi told reporters that there is no question of accepting the suggestion of the Trinamool chief and SP chief to make Prime Minister Dr
 Manmohan Singh a presidential candidate, as the party had promised the public that by 2014, Dr
 Singh Only the Prime Minister will continue
 iske saath hi dvivedi kii baton se saaf ho gaya ki congress pranab or ansaari main se hi kisi ek ko pratyaashee banane ke mood main he or apije abdul kalam tathaa somnath chatarji uski pasand main shaamil nahin honge
 Who will be the president and who will be the president? Both these questions have become very important now

 party pravaktaa janardan dvivedi ne patrakaron ko bataaya ki trinmul pramukh or sapa pramukh dwaara pradhanmantri dow manmohan singh ko raashtrapati pad kaa pratyaashee banaae jane kaa suzav maan lene kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota, kyonki party ne janata se vaada kiya tha ki 2014 tak dow singh hi pradhanmantri bane rahenge
 With this, it was clear from Dwivedi that the Congress is in the mood to nominate one of Pranab and Ansari and APJ Abdul Kalam and Somnath Chatterjee will not join his choice
 koun banegaa raashtrapati or koun banayega raashtrapati? ye donon sawaal ab behad ahm ho gaye hai
 On Wednesday, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav's political moves have changed the entire strategy
 is puure masale par kai tarah ke sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 For example, did mamata-mulayam not even think it necessary to talk to Kalam, Manmohan and Somnath Chatterjee before presenting them for the presidency? Did the Congress not feel it necessary to stand with its Prime Minister and say that under pressure from anyone, she was not going to replace Manmohan Singh? Will other parties also join mulayam-mamta's initiative? Will the Congress now bargain with Mulayam and Mamata and will some new names come out for the presidential election? sawaalon kaa yah silsilaa yaheen khatm nahin hota, lekin is bich guuruuvaar subah pranab mukherjee ne sonia gandhi ke saath unke awaas par mulaakaat kii
 In this meeting which lasted for 20 minutes, Defense Minister AK Antony was also present and later P
 Chidambaram also reached 10, Janpath
 isi mudde par shaam ko congress kor cameti kii bhi ahm baithak hone vaali he
 Till now, Pranab da was the only presidential candidate from the cabinet, but mamta-mulayam brought him in front of his own Prime Minister in a jolt
 lekin baat sirf itani hi nahin he
 If Manmohan Singh's name catches on for the presidency, it means that the Congress will have to choose a new Prime Minister
 congress party main pranab se behatar iskaa daavedaar or koun ho saktaa he
 
 
 So today, two contenders for the post of President and perhaps Prime Minister will be face to face
 aise main cabinet baithak kaa maahaul tanaav bharaa ho saktaa he
 At least this is what non-congress parties would want
 vaise agar in donon kii marji chale, to pranab mukherjee raashtrapati bhawan janaa chahenge or pradhanmantri saat res course road nahin chhodana chahenge
 The comments dilachasp yah he ki mulaayam or mamata ne jo teen naam raashtrapati pad ke liye pesh kiye unase pehle baat karne kii jarurat hi nahin samajhi
 Somnath Chatterjee, who was the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, told NDTV clearly that he has not spoken to any political party
 unhone kaha, mujhe yah bhi nahin pataa ki mamata or mulaayam ne kin vajahon se mere naam kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 However, i feel honored to offer my name

 On the other hand, the BJP has accused the UPA of differences over the presidential candidate

 Actually, after the fight between Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover, Sunil Grover refused to appear in 'the Kapil Sharma Show'
 sunil ke samarthan main sho ke duusare sitare bhi utre or sho main nani banane vaale ali asagar ne bhi sho chhod diya
 Let me know that Mausi's entry in Kapil's show

 in saare sitaaro ke chale jane ke baad kapil ke sho kii tiarapy to jarur ghati he lekin yah baat bhi saamne ai he ki tiarapy ke maamle main kapil abhi bhi sunil grover se aage hai

 According to Sunil Groversutra, who will make a comeback on TV from this show, Sony Channel now wants to bring a new show with Sunil Grover, with Sunil in the lead role

 What is the matter: Significantly, while returning to Australia to do the show, Kapil had misbehaved with Sunil on the flight
 unhone sunil ko gaali di thi or khabaren to yahaan tak hai ki unhone sunil ko juuta phenk kar bhi maaraa tha
 In this film, Kapil Sharma was made Nana Patekar's servant
 
 
 darasal kapil sharaab ke nashe main the or unhen is baat par gussa aa gaya tha ki unke saathiyon ne unke pehle khaanaa khaanaa kaise shuru kar diya
 Kapil told Sunil that whatever you are today, it is because of me
 tu apana sho lekar aayaa tha naa, lekin wo flop ho gaya
 However, during this whole event Sunil thought it better to remain silent
 lekin wo is ghatana se itane aahat hue ki unhone kapil kaa sho hi chhod diya

 It is clear from this scene that lesbian love story is shown in the film
 trailor ke last main sonam kapur ek ladki ke saath bhaagti hui bhi najar aati hai
 The film shows Sonam and Rajkumar Rao's good bonding
 sonam, rajkumaar ko sabase pehla apana sikret bataati hai
 In the film, on one side, Anil Kapoor is in a hurry to get his daughter married
 yahaan tak ki wo muslim ladke se bhi shaadi karaane ko taiyaar hai

 Information on political violence in Kerala is less in Hindi states, more is the perception
 hinsa ko lekar ek chhavi ban gai he, magar vahaan ke halaat kii na to koi reporting he yaa na kisi prakaar kii soochna jisase vahaan ke halaat ko samajhane kaa mauka mili
 While doing research on the violence in Kerala, it seemed that the situation is really frightening
 hinsa ke is khel main donon hi paksh shikaar bhi hai or shikari bhi yani donon hi pakshon ke log maare bhi ja rahe hai or ek duusare ko maar bhi rahe hai
 Politics is not done with scales
 isliye ek paksh khud ko hi peedit ke rup main pesh karata he, apane kilaaf hui hinsa ko ubharta he magar aapako kabhi nahin bataata ki uski taraf se bhi hinsa kaa yah khel khelaa gaya he
 Kannur is a district of Kerala
 yaheen se rajya ke mukhyamantri pinarai vijayan aate hai
 The district has been under political violence since the 1960s
 30 july ko kerala kii rajdhani tiruvanantpuram main sangh kaaryakarta kii hatya kar di gai
 Five people have been detained on charges of murder
 ghatana ke baad grahamantri rajnath singh ne kerala kii hinsa par chintaa zaahir kii thi or kaha tha ki loktantr main raajnneetik hinsa sweekaarya nahin he
 Rajesh, 34, was surrounded and killed by many people
 baayan haath kaat diya gaya or kai jagahon par bhayankar chotein ai hai
 The BJP has accused the CPM of this murder
 sipiem ne khandan kiya he
 Congress leaders have fasted against this politics of violence
 somvaar ko kerala kii hinsa ko lekar mukhyamantri pinarai vijayan ne ek baithak bhi bulaai
 The BJP spoke to RSS leaders and talked about ways to resolve political differences
 baithak shuru hone se pehle mukhyamantri ne aapa bhi kho diya or vahaan aae media se get out kah diya
 Now-a-days, the media began to consider the leader as worthy
 aap janata kaa bhavishya bahut ujjwal he
 When the inquirer has this condition, remember that no one will be left to ask for you
 godi media sirf dilli main nahin he, wo har rajya main he
 As a result, you audience will have to suffer
 apni samasya lekar patrkaar ko whatsap karte rah jaaenge or wo aapke liye kuch nahin kar sakegaa
 Leaders have come to know that you audience does not matter
 iskaa matlab yah he unhen aapaki bhi parvaah nahin he
 The Chief Minister's Office said that the media was not allowed to come
 yahi baat tareeke se bhi kahi ja sakati thi, get out ke bagair
 After the meeting, leaders of BJP and CPM said that they will bring awareness against violence
 yah bhi tay hua he ki bijepi aresas or sipiem ke kader ke bich shanti vaarta kai zilon main yojit kii jaaegi taaki aapasi samvaad bane
 This is not the first incident of violence in Kerala, after several decades of violence, CPM, BJP union workers should be expected from a peace meeting
 varna haalat yah he ki donon paksh ek duusare par hamalaa karne main ek minute bhi nahin sochate hai
 However, the violence that has been going on since the 1960s, they will try to find out why
 is hinsa par research karte hue kerala kaa jo swaroop samaj main aata he wo bhayanak he
 Murder is not just murder but murder in a different way
 aisi ki aap hatya kaa detail nahin bataa sakate hai
 We have found a way out of limited resources to talk about Kerala
 kuch website or akhbaaron main chape lekh or vishleshan ko aadhaar banaaya he
 There may be some omissions from this, but full care is taken not to make any big mistake
 kerala kii hinsa ham sabake liye shame kii baat he or rajya main sakriy raajnneetik dalon ke liye to or bhi shame kii baat he
 We may call ourselves non-violent, call them tolerant, but such incidents bring a curtain down on this hollow pride of India

 Youth between 19 years and 34 years are victims of this political violence
 30 july ko sangh kaaryakarta kii hatya kii gai lekin kerala kii hinsa kaa ricard dekhen to sipiem ke kaaryakarta bhi usee taadaad main maare ja rahe hai
 If the Sangh BJP workers are killed then the accused always belong to the CPM and the CPM cadres are killed then the accused always belong to the Sangh BJP

 There is very little land and people in ordinary surroundings
 kyon is jati ke yuva donon taraf kii hinsa main shaamil rahe hai, shikaar hue hai, shikaar kiya he, is par alag se baat honi chahie
 Ruchi has said that 80 per cent of the people killed in the violence are Hindus and 70 per cent of them were unemployed
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki is hinsa kaa koi sampradayik rup he
 There are many propaganda in Delhi's media or from Delhi to Kerala
 daily o dot in par malayalam logon ke ek samooh ne likhaa he

 Only CPM and Sangh supporters were killed? Congress workers were also killed in 14 cases

 BJP and Congress workers are also involved in the murder of each other
 indian muslim lig or sipiem kaaryakartaaon ne bhi ek duusare ko maaraa he
 The CPM and the Sangh were accused but the killed activists included the CPM, the Sangh, the BJP, the Congress and the Indian Muslim League
 ek report main ek or aankada he jise pesh kar rahaa hum
 According to the Kerala Police, there have been 69 political murders in Kannur between 2000 and 2006
 31 sangh parivaar ke maare gaye hai or 30 sipiem ke
 Five from the Indian Muslim League and 3 from the National Democratic Front
 kai baar media donon hatyaon ko dikhaakar vishleshan nahin karata he
 On 30 January 2017, Sangh activists attack a 63-year-old Congress worker in Kannur
 us din shaam aath baje bijepi ke 32 saal ke sajith par hamalaa hota he, hatya ho jaati he or aarope sipiem par lagata he
 Both incidents were reported in the Kerala media but only the killing of the Sangh pracharak was shown and propaganda in the national media
 hinsa pratihinsa ke is daur main police kii bhoomika par bhi baat honi chahie
 Have the accused from both sides been punished in any incident
 hindu main 19 disambar 2016 kii report he
 11 Sangh workers are sentenced to life imprisonment in the murder of CPM worker
 trial court ne 2008 main sipiem netaa ve vishnu kii hatya ke aarope main yah sazaa sunai thi
 We have found all this with the help of internet search
 sipiem netaaon kii giraftaareyon kii kai khabaren mili hai
 According to the news published in Times of India on 21 April 2011 seshans court ne sipiem ke 24 kaaryakartaaon ko aaajeevan karawas kii sazaa sunai thi
 Two people returning from the funeral of the union worker were killed
 ye ghatana 23 may 2002 kii thi
 In this way, you are seeing how political parties have taken blood in the violence in Kerala
 aap tarkon se idhar udhar karte rahiye magar sochiye us samaaj ke bare main bhi jo in dalon ke hiton ke liye kisi kii hatya kar rahaa he, maaraa ja rahaa he
 People of ordinary families are facing life imprisonment and the leaders of these parties are shining political comfort and sitting in Delhi doing propaganda
 raajnneetik dal aam logon kii ye haalat kar dete hai
 Therefore, it is important to talk about the violence in Kerala in front of the whole country that why a district has such a blood laboratory
 inke satta hasil kar lene se janata kaa koun sa kalyaan ho gaya he
 This politics of murder and violence should be rejected
 tippaniyan According to an India Today report, Kannur has witnessed 400 cases of political violence since the cpm-led LDF government came to power in May 2016
 is report ke mutabik beete teen saal main raajnneetik hinsa main 30 fisadi kaa izaafaa hua he
 In these cases of violence, 600 CPM workers, 300 RSS-BJP workers and 50 Congress workers have been arrested
 kerala se sambandhit report or vishleshan padhate vakt donon pakshon ke netaaon ke bayaan dekh rahaa tha
 Everyone has so much confidence in his arguments that no one is ready to accept his mistake
 sabake paas jaays kaaran he ki hinsa wo nahin, saamne vaala kar rahaa he
 No one can show condolences for the casualties of any side
 badale kii aag he
 Revenge is taken and revenge is taken
 ummid kii jaani chahie ki shanti cametiyon or baithkon kaa nateeja nikalegaa
 When CPM and Sangh workers sit face to face, they will look at each other's eyes and some shame
 pratishodh kii raajnneeti ne kitnon ko marava diya or kitnon ko jail bhijwa diya
 On one side, the question will come as to why the people of the Sangh threw a bomb at the CPM office, the question will come from the other side why the CPM people threw the bomb at the Sangh BJP office
 aapasi raajnneeti ke liye itane bam kahaan se aa jate hai wo bhi tab jab desh khud ko aatankwaad se ladane vaala champion ghoshit kar chukaa he
 Is it written on the bombs that it is for terrorism and it is for political murder
 30 july ko kerala kii rajdhani tiruvanantpuram main sangh kaaryakarta kii hatya kar di gai
 Five people have been detained on charges of murder
 ghatana ke baad grahamantri rajnath singh ne kerala kii hinsa par chintaa zaahir kii thi or kaha tha ki loktantr main raajnneetik hinsa sweekaarya nahin he
 Rajesh, 34, was surrounded and killed by many people
 baayan haath kaat diya gaya or kai jagahon par bhayankar chotein ai hai
 The BJP has accused the CPM of this murder
 sipiem ne khandan kiya he
 Congress leaders have fasted against this politics of violence
 somvaar ko kerala kii hinsa ko lekar mukhyamantri pinarai vijayan ne ek baithak bhi bulaai
 The BJP spoke to RSS leaders and talked about ways to resolve political differences
 baithak shuru hone se pehle mukhyamantri ne aapa bhi kho diya or vahaan aae media se get out kah diya
 Now-a-days, the media began to consider the leader as worthy
 aap janata kaa bhavishya bahut ujjwal he
 When the inquirer has this condition, remember that no one will be left to ask for you
 godi media sirf dilli main nahin he, wo har rajya main he
 As a result, you audience will have to suffer
 apni samasya lekar patrkaar ko whatsap karte rah jaaenge or wo aapke liye kuch nahin kar sakegaa
 Leaders have come to know that you audience does not matter
 iskaa matlab yah he unhen aapaki bhi parvaah nahin he
 The Chief Minister's Office said that the media was not allowed to come
 yahi baat tareeke se bhi kahi ja sakati thi, get out ke bagair
 After the meeting, leaders of BJP and CPM said that they will bring awareness against violence
 yah bhi tay hua he ki bijepi aresas or sipiem ke kader ke bich shanti vaarta kai zilon main yojit kii jaaegi taaki aapasi samvaad bane
 This is not the first incident of violence in Kerala, after several decades of violence, CPM, BJP union workers should be expected from a peace meeting
 varna haalat yah he ki donon paksh ek duusare par hamalaa karne main ek minute bhi nahin sochate hai
 However, the violence that has been going on since the 1960s, they will try to find out why
 is hinsa par research karte hue kerala kaa jo swaroop samaj main aata he wo bhayanak he
 Murder is not just murder but murder in a different way
 aisi ki aap hatya kaa detail nahin bataa sakate hai
 We have found a way out of limited resources to talk about Kerala
 kuch website or akhbaaron main chape lekh or vishleshan ko aadhaar banaaya he
 There may be some omissions from this, but full care is taken not to make any big mistake
 kerala kii hinsa ham sabake liye shame kii baat he or rajya main sakriy raajnneetik dalon ke liye to or bhi shame kii baat he
 We may call ourselves non-violent, call them tolerant, but such incidents bring a curtain down on this hollow pride of India

 Otherwise, the condition is that the two sides do not think even a minute to attack each other
 baharhaal, jo hinsa 1960 ke dashak se chali aa rahi he, wo kyon jari he, yah jaanane kaa prayaas karenge
 While doing research on this violence, the nature of Kerala is understandable
 hatya sirf hatya nahin balki vibhats tareeke se hatya hoti he
 Such that you cannot tell the details of the murder

 We have seen many reporting of murders, it seems that most of those killed are young people
 19 saal se lekar 34 saal ke bich ke yuva hi is raajnneetik hinsa ke shikaar hai
 The Sangh worker was killed on 30 July but CPM workers are also being killed in the same number if they see the record of Kerala violence
 agar sangh bijepi ke kaaryakarta maare jate hai to aaropee hameshaa sipiem ke hote hai or sipiem ke kaaryakarta maare jate hai to aaropee hameshaa sangh bijepi ke hote hai
 The Kannur violence begins with the assassination of Bharatiya Jana Sangh activist Ramakrishnan in the 1960s
 is hatya ke badale main sipiem kaaryakarta kii hatya kar di jaati he
 Just as the bread turns on the pan, in the same way Kannur is subjected to revenge violence

 If there is mention of CPM in any murder or Sangh in any murder, then its reference is that they are accused of involvement

 saaf he ki donon paksh laash kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 In Delhi, even though one of the parties describes themselves as victims, they are killed and looking at the list of allegations, it seems that both of them are not clean

 An allegation of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has been challenged in The Wire
 vihip kaa kahana he ki 300 se zyada sangh samarthak maare gaye hai or aadhe dalit hai
 BRP Bhaskar has written that this is not correct
 300 log maare gaye hai magar isamen sipiem or sangh donon ke hai
 And half the Dalits are not right
 kerala kii hinsa par research karne vaali uniwarsity of kep toun kii lekturer ruchi chaturvedi ne likhaa he ki kannur kii hinsa main thiyya jati ke log maare gaye hai
 This caste enjoys OBC status in Kerala
 bahut kam zamin he or saadhaaran parivesh ke log hai
 Why the youth of this caste have been involved in violence on both sides, have been hunted, hunted, this should be discussed separately
 ruchi ne kaha he ki hinsa main maare gaye 80 fisadi hindu hai or isamen 70 fisadi yuva berojgaar the

 In one propaganda, Kottayam district is said to be Muslim-dominated while the district has a Muslim population of 6 percent

 Ruchi Chaturvedi, lecturer of the University of Cape Town, who has done research on the violence in Kerala, has written that the Thiyya caste people have been killed in the Kannur violence
 kerala main is jati ko obisi kaa darja hasil he
 There is very little land and people in ordinary surroundings
 kyon is jati ke yuva donon taraf kii hinsa main shaamil rahe hai, shikaar hue hai, shikaar kiya he, is par alag se baat honi chahie
 Ruchi has said that 80 per cent of the people killed in the violence are Hindus and 70 per cent of them were unemployed
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki is hinsa kaa koi sampradayik rup he
 There are many propaganda in Delhi's media or from Delhi to Kerala
 daily o dot in par malayalam logon ke ek samooh ne likhaa he
 This group is called Pisces Avial
 inkaa daawa he ki inke samooh main sabhi dal ke malayalam log shaamil hai
 The group has challenged a propaganda that Kannur has 38 per cent Muslims
 2011 kii janaganana ke anusaar 29
 43 percent are Muslim
 ek propeganda main kottayam zile ko muslim bahul bataaya gaya he jabaki us zile main musalamaanon kii aabaadi 6 pratishat he
 Is the violence in Kerala related to Hindu Muslim politics
 is tarah kaa propeganda failaayaa ja rahaa he taaki hindi bhashi pradeshon main ye baaten aasaani se fail jaaen
 If there is a communal form, then it can be discussed openly
 ruchi chaturvedi ne likhaa he ki kannur main 1983 se sitambar 2009 ke bich 91 log maare gaye
 31 supporters of the Sangh BJP have been killed
 sipiem ke 33 samarthak maare gaye hai
 Only CPM and Sangh supporters were killed? Congress workers were also killed in 14 cases
 zyaadaatar main aarope sipiem par laga
 BJP and Congress workers are also involved in the murder of each other
 indian muslim lig or sipiem kaaryakartaaon ne bhi ek duusare ko maaraa he
 The CPM and the Sangh were accused but the killed activists included the CPM, the Sangh, the BJP, the Congress and the Indian Muslim League
 ek report main ek or aankada he jise pesh kar rahaa hum
 According to the Kerala Police, there have been 69 political murders in Kannur between 2000 and 2006
 31 sangh parivaar ke maare gaye hai or 30 sipiem ke
 Five from the Indian Muslim League and 3 from the National Democratic Front
 kai baar media donon hatyaon ko dikhaakar vishleshan nahin karata he
 On 30 January 2017, Sangh activists attack a 63-year-old Congress worker in Kannur
 us din shaam aath baje bijepi ke 32 saal ke sajith par hamalaa hota he, hatya ho jaati he or aarope sipiem par lagata he
 Both incidents were reported in the Kerala media but only the killing of the Sangh pracharak was shown and propaganda in the national media
 hinsa pratihinsa ke is daur main police kii bhoomika par bhi baat honi chahie
 Have the accused from both sides been punished in any incident
 hindu main 19 disambar 2016 kii report he
 11 Sangh workers are sentenced to life imprisonment in the murder of CPM worker
 trial court ne 2008 main sipiem netaa ve vishnu kii hatya ke aarope main yah sazaa sunai thi
 We have found all this with the help of internet search
 sipiem netaaon kii giraftaareyon kii kai khabaren mili hai
 According to the news published in Times of India on 21 April 2011 seshans court ne sipiem ke 24 kaaryakartaaon ko aaajeevan karawas kii sazaa sunai thi
 Two people returning from the funeral of the union worker were killed
 ye ghatana 23 may 2002 kii thi
 In this way, you are seeing how political parties have taken blood in the violence in Kerala
 aap tarkon se idhar udhar karte rahiye magar sochiye us samaaj ke bare main bhi jo in dalon ke hiton ke liye kisi kii hatya kar rahaa he, maaraa ja rahaa he
 People of ordinary families are facing life imprisonment and the leaders of these parties are shining political comfort and sitting in Delhi doing propaganda
 raajnneetik dal aam logon kii ye haalat kar dete hai
 Therefore, it is important to talk about the violence in Kerala in front of the whole country that why a district has such a blood laboratory
 inke satta hasil kar lene se janata kaa koun sa kalyaan ho gaya he
 This politics of murder and violence should be rejected
 tippaniyan According to an India Today report, Kannur has witnessed 400 cases of political violence since the cpm-led LDF government came to power in May 2016
 is report ke mutabik beete teen saal main raajnneetik hinsa main 30 fisadi kaa izaafaa hua he
 In these cases of violence, 600 CPM workers, 300 RSS-BJP workers and 50 Congress workers have been arrested
 kerala se sambandhit report or vishleshan padhate vakt donon pakshon ke netaaon ke bayaan dekh rahaa tha
 Everyone has so much confidence in his arguments that no one is ready to accept his mistake
 sabake paas jaays kaaran he ki hinsa wo nahin, saamne vaala kar rahaa he
 No one can show condolences for the casualties of any side
 badale kii aag he
 Revenge is taken and revenge is taken
 ummid kii jaani chahie ki shanti cametiyon or baithkon kaa nateeja nikalegaa
 When CPM and Sangh workers sit face to face, they will look at each other's eyes and some shame
 pratishodh kii raajnneeti ne kitnon ko marava diya or kitnon ko jail bhijwa diya
 On one side, the question will come as to why the people of the Sangh threw a bomb at the CPM office, the question will come from the other side why the CPM people threw the bomb at the Sangh BJP office
 aapasi raajnneeti ke liye itane bam kahaan se aa jate hai wo bhi tab jab desh khud ko aatankwaad se ladane vaala champion ghoshit kar chukaa he
 Is it written on the bombs that it is for terrorism and it is for political murder
 is samooh ne ek propeganda ko chunauti di he ki kannur main 38 fisadi muslim hai

 sipiem or sangh ke kaaryakarta jab aamane saamne baithenge to ek duusare kii nazaron kaa lihaaz karenge or kuch shame bhi
 The politics of vengeance killed many and sent some to jail
 ek taraf se sawaal aayega ki sipiem ke daftar par sangh ke logon ne bam kyon phenkaa to duusari taraf se sawaal aayega ki sangh bijepi ke daftar par sipiem ke logon ne bam kyon phenkaa
 Where do so many bombs come from for mutual politics, even when the country has declared itself a champion in fighting terrorism

 BJP and Congress workers are also involved in the murder of each other
 indian muslim lig or sipiem kaaryakartaaon ne bhi ek duusare ko maaraa he
 The CPM and the Sangh were accused but the killed activists included the CPM, the Sangh, the BJP, the Congress and the Indian Muslim League

 Five from the Indian Muslim League and 3 from the National Democratic Front

 People of ordinary families are facing life imprisonment and the leaders of these parties are shining political comfort and sitting in Delhi doing propaganda

 Therefore, it is important to talk about the violence in Kerala in front of the whole country that why a district has such a blood laboratory

 This politics of murder and violence should be rejected

 ' pakistan kii ore se kartarpur sahib coridor khole jane ke baad donon deshon ke rishton main dekhi ja rahi narmi ke bich bhartiya videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne do took shabdon main paak ke saath dwipaksheeya baatcheet kii sambhaavna ko nakaar diya he
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said that for the last several years the Indian government had been asking for this (kartarpur) corridor, but now Pakistan has responded positively
 haalanki, iskaa yah matlab nahin ki aatankwaad or baatcheet ek saath nahin chal sakati
 In Hyderabad, he said that talks cannot be started with Pakistan until Pakistan stops terrorism
 jahaan tak kartarpur coridor kaa sawaal he to kisi ek ko credit nahin diya janaa chahie kyonki ekatarfa maamla nahin he
 The political relationship between the two countries is extremely strong
 lambey samay se sheersh str par koi baatcheet nahin hui he
 Sushma's statement came at a time when Pakistan, which is going to open one Okaratarpur corridor, has said to walk on the other side to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to join the SAARC conference
 pakistan ke videsh mantralay kii taraf se di gai is jaankaree ke jawaab main bharat sarkaar ke ek bade adhikari ne saaf kar diya ki bharat saarc kaa abhinn hissaa he or use vishesh nimantran kii zarurat nahin he, vaise bhi is sammelan ko lekar koi taarikh bhi tay nahin hui he
 The 20 South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Conference 2016 is to be held in Pakistan
 haalanki, isse pehle 2016 main 19wein saarc shikhar sammelan kaa aayojan bhi pakistan main kiya janaa tha, lekin bharat samet bangladesh, bhutan or afghanistan ne is summit main hissaa lene se inkaar kar diya tha, jiske baad ye sammelan radd karnaa padaa tha
 Bangladesh did not attend the conference citing domestic conditions
 mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main bolte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek naye formule kii baat kahi he
 This new formula is to place civil duties above civil rights
 jaaniye kartavyon ke bare main kya kahata he hamaara samvidhan or pradhanmantri kyon chaahate hai aisa
 Prime Minister Modi said that most of the things in our country have been focused on rights
 ye ek aisa avasar he ki desh kaa paradime shift karke adhikaar se kartavyon par le chalem
 The responsibility of public representatives increases here more
 unhone apni baat ko pukhta karne ke liye mahatma gandhi, jawahar laal nehru or ram manohar lohia ko bhi kot kiya
 Let us know the civil duties that were added many years after the constitution was made
 ye hai bharat ke nagarikon ke moulik kartavyasardaar swarna singh samiti kii anushansa par samvidhan ke 42wein sanshodhan (1976 i) dwaara moulik kartavya samvidhan main jode gaye
 All these fundamental rights were derived from the Constitution of Russia
 ise bhaag 4(k) main anuchhed 51(k) ke tahat rakhaa gaya
 They are 11 in number
 1
 It is the duty of every citizen to uphold the Constitution and respect the national flag and the national anthem
 It is the duty of every citizen to follow the constitution and respect its ideals, institutions, national flag and national anthem
 2
 Keep and follow the high ideals that inspire our national movement for freedom
 3
 Preserve the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India and keep it intact
 4
 Protect the country
 5
 To create a sense of harmony and equal brotherhood among all the people of India
 6
 Understand the importance of the glorious tradition of our social culture and create it
 7
 Protect and promote the natural environment
 8
 Develop scientific outlook and sense of learning
 9
 Protect public property
 10
 In every field of individual and group activities, make continuous efforts to move towards Utkarsh
 11
 These duties (86th amendment) were later added, which included the duty of parents or guardians to provide primary education to children aged 6 to 14 years
 ye chote-chote niyam maanakar kar sakate hankertavya kaa paalansadak par chalane se lekar kisi colony main rahane tak ke liye nagarikon ke liye saamaajik niyam banaae gaye hai
 These rules are also directly related to the Constitution
 masalan sadak par chalate samay aap baayen chalem yaa laal batti na paar karen
 Do not pollute or damage public places
 agar ham kartavyon kii raah par chalem to prakruti kii suraksha or sangrakshan bhi samvidhan main nihit he
 But people are not willing to follow social rules based on constitutional laws
 nehru kaa voteuotejo modi ne sadan main rakhaa saamne14 july 1951 ko chunaav se pehle apane menifesto main jawahar laal nehru dwaara rakhaa gaya kot sansad sadan main pradhanmantri modi ne doharaaya
 This is Nehru's Quote One of the major lessons of India in the world is that duties come first here and rights come out of these duties
 aaj ke aadhunik bhautikwaadi vishwa main jahaan har taraf takaraav dikhaai padate hai, vahaan har koi apane adhikaron or suvidha kii baat karata he
 Hardly anyone talks about duty
 yahi takaraav kii vajah he
 Fight for the convenience of rights
 sach yah he ki yadi kartavyon ko bhul jaaen to adhikaron kii ladaai nahin lard paaenge
 Vodafone has not made much headlines in the last few days as the company has not launched any new plans
 company ne haal philhal main naa hi koi preeped plan launch kiya he or naa hi koi postped plan launch kiya he
 However, now Vodafone has launched a film recharge of Rs 16
 is plan main graahakon ko 24 ghante ke liye 1GB data milegaa
 This plan is also available to Idea customers
 vodaphone ke nae 16 rupee vaale plan kii baat vistaar se karen to isamen graahakon ko data ke alaava kol yaa SMS kaa laabh nahin milegaa
 In this new internet plan of Vodafone, customers will get 1GB 2G / 3G / 4G data for one day
 jaisaa ki naam se hi samajha ja saktaa he company ne is plan ko isliye utaara he ki graahak apane smartphone main koi movie dekh saken
 However, this is the same plan as the rest of the data pack, which can be blended with any other plan
 keval naam hi alag rakhaa gaya he
 Idea also offered a similar 16-rupee plan
 agar aap vodaphone graahak hai or 16 rupee se zyada kaa internet richarge karnaa chaahate hai to aapke paas or bhi opshans hai
 Customers can avail the Rs 29 plan, it will get 500MB of data for 28 days
 isi tarah 47 rupee vaale plan main 1 din ke liye 3GB data, 92 rupee vaale plan main 7 dinon ke liye 6GB data milegaa
 Similarly, plans with validity of 28 days include plans of Rs 98, Rs 49 and Rs 33
 inamen kramash: 3GB, 1GB or 500MB data diya jaataa he
 Apart from this, let us also know that after keeping customers away from talk-time plans for some time, Vodafone has introduced these plans again in its portfolio
 kuch sayam ke liye vodaphone 50 rupee, 100 rupee or 500 rupee ke plance ko hataa diya tha
 However, now the company has introduced plans of Rs 100 and Rs 500
 iske alaava company ke paas 10 rupee, 1,000 rupee or 5,000 rupee ke bhi plance hai
 However, the problem with these plans is that they do not get lifetime validity and many plans come with only 28 days validity

 pratibandhon kii vajahon se iran or nai dilli ke rishton par padane vaale asar ko lekar america agle kuchhek maheene main bharat se baatcheet kar saktaa he
 This has come to the fore after US special Nikki Haley's suggestion at the United Nations to reduce trade relations with Iran
 haal hi main bharat daure par ain nikki heli ne bharat ko iran se rishton ko sicodne kaa suzav diya tha
 However, the first round of US sanctions on Iran starts on 6 August while the second phase will start on 6 November
 sutron ke hawaale se indian express kii ek report bataati he ki america un deshon se baatcheet karne kii taiyaari kar rahaa he jinase usne iran se tel aayaat kam karne ko kah rahaa he
 Sources said that during this dialogue, India is negotiating the possibility of reviewing the rupee-riyal system for importing oil from Iran in view of US sanctions
 bhartiya hit kaa sawalek sutara ne bataaya, 'ummid he ki agle kuch hafton main ham is masale par america se baatcheet karen
 We cannot tell in advance what America will do
 ' India can convey its concern about the Chabahar project to the US, which is strategically important for it
 bataa den ki afghanistan- pakistan ke bich bharat ne chabahaar bandargah kii sthapana kii he
 An informal indication is that Washington dc's Donald Trump is aware of India's concerns over the Prashan Chabahar port and will keep India away from its move to impose sanctions on Iran
 shipping or bandargah bhi america pabandi ke daayre main aate hai
 What is the real matter? Actually, after breaking the nuclear agreement with Iran, US President Donald Trump is also trying to ensure that this country endowed with oil wells is financially broken
 july, 2015 main iran or sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke paanch sthai sadasyon ke bich parmaanu samjhauta hua tha
 The then US President Barack Obama granted relief from sanctions in exchange for limiting Iran's nuclear program under the agreement
 magar may, 2018 main iran par zyaada dabaav banane ke vaaste trump ne ye samjhauta tod diya
 Trump has asked foreign companies doing business in Iran to stop investing
 america pratibandhon kaa paalan nahin karne vaali companiyon par baari jurmaane kii bhi dhamkee de rahaa he
 European leaders involved in a nuclear deal with Iran also tried to convince Trump on the issue, but Trump fulfilled his election promise and announced the end of the Obama administration's agreement with Iran
 ab chunki america ke sahyogi desh is mudde par uske saath nahin hai, lihaaja trump ab iran ko aarthik nuksaan pahunchane ke liye har sambhav daanv aajmaana chaahate hai
 What is the US strategy? According to this strategy, the US is prohibiting other countries including India from importing oil from Iran
 sutron kaa kahana he, 'isamen koi andeh nahin ki america bharat or anya deshon par iran se tel aayaat nahin karne kaa dabaav banane ja rahaa he
 The question is how do we see our national interest and present our case to America
 ise abhi kiya janaa he
 'india has been buying oil from Iran under the rupee-riyal system since the sanctions were lifted three years ago
 is pranali ke tahat bharat tel ke badale 55 fisadi bhugtan euro ke jariye karata he jabaki 45 fisadi kaa bhugtan vah rupee ke jariye karata he
 Sources say that in May, Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swarajairan had not given any assurance to her counterpart Mohammad Javed Zarif about oil imports
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki petroleum mantralay ne iran se tel aayaat band karne ke bhi sanket nahin die hai
 Iran is the third country to export oil to India after Saudi Arabia and Iraq

 darasal, congress ne ashanka jaahir kii he kiareseski shakhaon main jane vaale sarkari karmchaaree bijepi ke paksh main chunaav prabhavit kar sakate hai
 However, BJP has termed the Congress allegations completely baseless
 bijepi pravaktaa rajnish agarwal ne congress par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki naksalwadiyon ko maanavadhikaaravaadi bataane vaale sangh par sawaal khadaa kar rahe hai
 The Sangh is a patriot, discipline and sacramental organization
 unhone kaha kicongress kii mangagarasanvaidhanik he
 Let me tell you that earlier, the Congress has raised the question on EVM and has demanded to conduct the election with ballot paper

 monsoon aksh dilli ke paas pahunchamausam vibhaag kaa kahana he kirajdhani or aasapaaski jagahon par jhamajham barish kii vajah he monsoon ke aksh kaa dilli ke paas pahunchnaa
 At this time the axis of monsoon is moving from south to north
 iske alaava haryana ke upar ek cychlonic cirkulation bana hua he jisase badalon main nam hawaaon kaa bahaav ortej ho gaya he
 This is the reason why there is a dense cloud over Delhi

 Due to the close of the monsoon axis, the thickness of the clouds over western Uttar Pradesh is more, so the period of rains has intensified
 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki agle 24 se 48 ghanton main yahaan par tamaam jagahon par musaladhar barish kii khaasi sambhaavna he
 The Meteorological Department is expecting the rains to continue in the capital Delhi for the next 48 hours
 31 taarikh se milegi rahatjankaron kaa kahana he ki 31 taarikh kii raat se dilli ensiaar ke tamaam ilaakon ko barish or badalon se thodi raahat milegi
 But from August 1, the clouds of the capital will again be enveloping the sky
 isi ke saath 2 or 3 agast ko dilli samet uttar bharat ke tamaam ilaakon main jhamajham barish kaa ek nayaa daur phir se shuru ho jayega
 Overall, it can be said that except the slightest relief from the monsoon showers on the 31st, there will not be any chase for the next week

 Vivo V15 main speed or multitasking ke liye 2
 a 1 ghz octa-core mediatek Helio P70 processor has been used
 yah ek upyukt procesar he
 It is worth noting that mediatek Helio P70 chipset has also been used in Reality 3 (review) but its price is very low compared to Vivo V15

 There is a 5 mm headphone jack
 phone main jaan foonkane ke liye 4,000 eme kii bydaree di gai he, yah phone vivo dual-ingine fast charging saport ke saath aata he
 The presence of a micro-usb port in the Vivo V15 phone is surprising and disappointing when the lower priced phones are equipped with USB type-c standard port
 Vivo V15 Pro main in-disple fingerprint sensor diya gaya he jabaki vivo ve15 ke pichley hisse main fingerprint sensor ko jagah mili he
 Speaking of software, Vivo V15 runs on Android 9 Pie based on Funtouch OS 9
 hamaare paas maujuud rivyuu unit janvari 2019 security ptch par chalata he
 There is no app drawer in the phone, in such a situation you will have to swipe on the home screen and see the apps

 Apart from this, there is also a universal search bar with the help of which you can search the app, switch on the system settings and do quick web search
 Vivo V15 main kai eps pehle se hi pre-install hai jaise ki gaanaa (gaana), fasebuk (facebook), petm (paytm), newspoint (newspoint) yusi brouzar (UC Browser) or phone pe (phonepe)
 Funtouch OS 9 also has some features of its own

 Funtouch OS 9 comes with two power saving modes
 'lo power mod' sipiu or jeepiyu kii speed ko optimise kar detaa he, automaticli screen britaness ko kam kar detaa he, vaai-faai or bluetooth ko disable kar detaa he or anya upaay karata he jo power kii khapat ko kam karne main madad karte hai
 The second mode is 'extreme power-saving Mode'
 yah phone, massez, contact or clock ko chhodkar sabhi activity or eps ko band kar detaa he
 Before we talk about performance, let's talk about the display of Vivo V15
 vivo ve15 pro kii tarah isamen bhi super amolade panel he jo 6
 Comes with 53 inch in-cell LCD display with a resolution of 1080 × 2340 pixels
 color output acha he or text crisp nazar aate hai
 The viewing angles of the phone are also good
 phul-screen dizin hone kii vazah se phone par game khilne or phul-echdi 60 frem prati second vaali video dekhnaa acha lagata he
 The default color profile of Vivo V15 is on the cold side but you can also change it as per your choice if you want
 ankhon ko thakne se bachaane ke liye color tone ko bhi edjust kiya ja saktaa he
 You can manually activate it or even schedule it
 phul-screen dizin kaaphi acha lagata he lekin ghumaavdaar kinare kuch screen content ko hide kar dete hai khaastaur se un eps ke saath jo scalling saport nahin karte
 If you wish, you can also disable full-screen scaling on a per-app basis

 On the basis of brightness, the display of Vivo V15 could have been slightly better
 phone ko indoor main istemaal karne par hamen koi samasya nahin hui lekin baahar din kii roshni main disple utane achche se nahin dikhataa
 The video and photo dim after the brightness is 100 percent
 iske alaava ek or baat he jo aapako niraash kar sakati he or wo yah he ki vivo ve15 ko Widevine L1 certification praapt nahin he
 It is worth noting that Vivo V15 Pro has also not received this certification
 iskaa matlab aap netflix (netflix) yaa amejan par echdi video ko stream nahin kar paaenge
 It is very surprising that even this mobile, which is expensive by Rs 20,000, is not equipped with this facility
 mediatech helio pi70 procesar dinabhar ke sabhi tosk ko achche se handle kar letaa he
 Social media and productivity apps open faster and switching between them was quite smooth
 6 jibi ram kii madad se bankground main kai eps aasaani se chalate hai
 However, the gaming performance was not very impressive
 hamane vivo ve15 (vivo V15) main PUBG Mobile, Asphalt 9: Legends or Modern Combat 5 ko khelkar dekha
 The PUBG Mobile Boy default was on medium setting, medium frame rate and balance graphics
 gaming ke dauraan anubhav adhiktar smooth rahaa lekin bich main kai baar aisa laga ki phone dhimaa ho gaya
 Asphalt 9: Legends ran without any problems
 fantch oes 9 kii vazah se phone main game kyub feechar diya gaya he jo gaming experions ko behatar banaata he lekin hamen game kyub list se pehle or baad main kisi tarah kaa koi impruvement nazar nahin aayaa
 Apart from this, the phone has a gram-centric feature called Game Assistant
 yah behatar experions ke liye sipiu or ram ko optimise kar detaa he
 During gaming, esports mode blocks the user's background apps and notifications
 ek baat jo gaur karne vaali he vah yah he ki isamen phase rikgnishan saport nahin diya gaya he
 The Vivo V15 and Vivo V15 Pro smartphones have a 32-megapixel selfie camera that comes with a motorized pop-up module
 philhal is baat kii jaankaree nahin he ki bhavishya main software apadet ke jariye ise yah security feechar milegaa yaa nahin
 At the same time, the fingerprint sensor also works fast and unlocks the phone in less than a second
 vivo ve15 kii camera parformens kii baat karen to camera yuai vivo ve15 pro kii tarah hi he
 The document scanning mode, Pro mode, AI beauty and AR stickers shortcuts are given at the bottom
 shater batan ke upar wide-angel mod, seen sillection or portate mod ko jagah mili he
 In the top you will find the control of the settings section, portrait lighting effects, live photos and HDR mode
 12 megapixl kaa primary sensor he, jiskaa aparchar epa / 1
 78 is, the company claims that the main camera is equipped with 24 million photo-sensitive units and it comes with dual pixel focusing technology that gives bright photos
 vivo ve15 se lee gai tasveeron main detail or colors sahi se capchar hue
 Photos taken from Vivo V15 in macro shots were quite good
 subject ke saath colors or detail bhi achche se capchar hue
 Shades came to Vibrant and the gradients were also good
 vivo ve15 kii tulana main redmy note 7 pro se liye cloj-ap shot behatar capchar hue the
 Photos taken in daylight came crisp, dynamic range and photos have good sharpness
 lo-lite main lee gai tasveeron main greni tekture or nois kii jhalak dekhne ko mili
 When compared, the Redmi Note 7 Pro (review) proved to be better than this
 portate shots main yah phone acchhee depth capchar karata he
 We liked the fact that the blur effect can be adjusted before and after taking a photo
 Vivo V15 ke camera focus ko achche se lock kar lete hai lekin age ditection behatar ho saktaa tha
 Wide-angle camera helps the user to capture wide panaroma
 hamen kisi tarah kaa koi bairel distorshan dekhne ko nahin mila
 The video is recorded at 30 frames per second with full-hd resolution
 yah baat aapako thodi niraash kar sakati he ki vivo ve15 (vivo V15) 60 frem prati second par 4ke yaa phul-echdi video record karne main sakasham nahin he
 Video recording was good but the phone did not have stabilization, which means that the video would feel shaking and vibration
 slo-moshan main video 30 frem prati second par 1280 x 720 picksal rijolution ke saath record hoti hai
 The detail was captured very well in the pictures taken with the 32 megapixel selfie camera, it also got good color reproduction and sharpness
 age ditection bhi sateek he
 You can also add filters and colorful effects with the help of the studio lighting effect
 eai beauty mod kai vikalp ke saath aata he jaise ki skin smoothning, skin litening, jolline sliming or ai enlargement
 Apart from this, there are also full-body beautification tools which reduce the vest line and make the leg thinner or larger
 phase beautification filter puri tasviir main color profile ko change kar detaa he

 He was asked about the future alliance as well as the question whether the Congress should ask all former party members to come back
 lekin unhone jawaab taal diya
 Jogi said that party vice-president Rahul Gandhi has formed a committee under senior leader AK Antony which is considering the matter
 samiti hi chunaav purv or chunaav ke baad ke sahyogiyon ke bare main faisla karegi or antim manjuuri ke liye congress upaadhyaksh tathaa adhyaksh ko ise saunpegi
