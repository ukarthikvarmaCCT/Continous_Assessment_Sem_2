jodtod main juty hai partiyanis bich bijepi ne poocha ki akhirtukior samay kyon maang rahe hai? navam tuki or vidhansabha spikar ne bhi kaha ki shanivaar ko vidhansabha kaa satr bulaane main kai dikkatein hai
 But the Governor did not like these arguments
 60 sadasyon waliarunachal vidhansabhaamein congress ke 15 vidhayak hai jabaki kalikho pul apane samarthan main 43 vidhayakon kaa daawa karte hai, baaki do seat khaali hai
 Now the eyes are fixed on what the speakers do
 bijepi bhi sarkaar banane kii taiyaari membijapi ne bhi pradesh main apni puri takat laga rakhi he
 In order to realize the dream of Congress-free India, PM Modi should go a step further in realizing the NDA government under the leadership of Pulke by again defeating the government made by the Supreme Court order in Arunachal
 loksabhaa ke is sheetakaaleen satr main kitna kaam hua, yah sunakar aap hairaan rah jaaenge
 The entire session worked for a total of 271 minutes i
e
 four hours and thirty minutes
 yah satr 5 disambar se 20 disambar tak chalanaa tha lekin ise do dinon pehle hi anishchit kaal ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 In this session too, like the previous session, there was uproar and 94 percent of the time the noise was lost
 is baar pruthak telugana ke mudde par sabase zyada hangaamaa hua
 On the other hand, there was a lot of uproar in the Rajya Sabha and work was also disrupted there, but there was a total utilization of 19 percent of the time
 yah dhyaan dene kii baat he ki sansad ko chalaane par har minute lagbhag dhai lakh rupee kharch hote hai
 There were many important bills in the Lok Sabha in which only 6 could be introduced
 lekin sirf ek hi vidheyak lokapal paarit ho paaya
 All the others were uprooted
 ab ve nai loksabhaa kaa intjaar karenge
 There are a total of 125 bills pending in Parliament, of which many are very important
 lekin ab ve kab paarit honge, yah kahana mushkil he
 This was the last session of the 15th Lok Sabha and now it will be called for vote on account only
 duusari sifarish main ek rajya sangh kaa ek mat hoga or anya ko associat sadsy ke rup main religat kiya jayega
 This means that in such a situation during the BCCI AGM, Chairman Shashank Manohar cannot vote, as Maharashtra would be the only recognized voter
 vidarbha or mumbai associat sadsy ke rup main religat ho jaaenge
 Similarly Niranjan Shah will not be able to vote, as Saurashtra will become Associate Member and Gujarat Chief Member
 is tarah se bihar, chhattisgarh or telugana ko bhi swatantra rajya hone ke kaaran matdaan kaa adhikaar mil jayega
 The National Cricket Club (NCC) will lose its voting rights
 isi tarah se niranjan shah matdaan nahin kar paaenge, kyonki saurashtra associat sadsy ban jayega or gujarat mukhya sadsy
 In this way, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Telangana will also get voting rights due to being an independent state
 rashtriya cricket club (ensisi) apana matdaan kaa adhikaar ganvaa degaa

 saini ne kaha ki kendra or rajya sarkaar kii janakalyankari yojanaon ko samaaj ke antim vyakti tak lekar jane ke liye agast main yatra kaa aayojan kiya jaayegaa
 Raje started the 'suraj Sankalp Yatra' at the Charbhuja Temple in Rajsamand before the Rajasthan assembly elections in 2013
 (input bhashaa se) Saini said that the yatra will be organized in August to take the public welfare schemes of the central and state government to the last person of the society
 raaje ne 2013 main rajasthan ke vidhansabha chunaav se purv 'suraaj sankalp yatra' kii shuruuaat rajsamand ke charbhuja mandir se kii thi
 (from input language) rajasthan marudhara gramin bank ke baahar chaar ghante tak line main khadi ek mahila achaanak behosh hokar gir gai
 Due to which, a five-month-old baby who died in his stomach died
 aspataal main doctor ne sonography karne ke liye kaha tha isliye teen din se garbhvatee mahila paise nikaalane ke liye bank ke chakkar kaat rahi thi lekin bank se 2 hajaar rupee nikaalane ke liye ghanerao gaanv kii is garbhvatee mahila ko qatari main laganaa baari pad gaya
 After the woman's fall, the women present outside the bank took over and immediately rushed her to the government hospital in Desuri
 jahaan se use sadadi or phir vahaan se bali refer kiya gaya
 Shyam Shrimali, a resident of Ghanerao, who was present outside the bank, said that happy Vallaram Hiranagar was pregnant for five months

 When the woman's body started bleeding, the women present there held siege
 bataaya jaataa he ki is ghatana main mahila ke pet main pal rahe paanch maheene ke garbhasth shishu kii maut ho gai he
 However, the woman is undergoing treatment at a Bali hospital
 maukey par pahunche pati ne dukh vyakt karte hue kaha ki wo bataakar nahin ai thi, pataa hota to main khud line main lag jaataa
 People did the labor of pregnant woman, Valaram Hiragar, works in light decoration work
 uske 3 saal or ek 5 saal kii bacchee he
 After this incident with the woman, the people present there created a ruckus
 logon kaa aarope he ki bank manager kii mileebhagat or santh-ganth ke chalate prabhaavshaalee logon ko pehle rupee die ja rahe hai, jabaki zaruratmandon ko ghanton tak line main khadey rahanaa padataa he
 Instead of money, the family of Dardamhila said that there was a dire need of money for sonography
 somvaar ko vah bank gai, jahaan kareeb teen se chaar ghante tak line main khadi rahi lekin paise nahi mili
 On the third day she went to the bank with the hope that today she will get the money
 paise to nahin mili, ulta use is haadase se guzarana padaa
 In rural areas, even after a month, lines are not being reduced to withdraw money from banks
 in kataron ko lekar bankkarmiyon kii ore se koi vyavastha nahin he
 From women to elderly, sick and pregnant women all stand in a line
 inke liye agal se line honi chahie
 Rajasthan Marudhara Gramin Bank says that they did not get any information about the line outside the bank
 bank main paise kam aa rahe hai jisaki vajah se killat he

 (input bhashaa se) Opposition parties have reacted sharply to the Kejriwal government's proposal to run odd-even number of vehicles a day to curb rising pollution in Delhi
 congress ne ise janvirohi qaraar diya he to bijepi ne bina kisi yojana ke aanan-fanan main uthaaya gaya kadam bataaya he
 What is Delhi government's decision: To reduce pollution from the capital, the Delhi government has decided that one day trains with numbers ending in 0,2,4,6,8 will run
 phir agle din visham jaise 1,3,5,7,9 ke ant vaale number kii gaadiyaan chalengi
 This will reduce the number of vehicles on Delhi's roads to half directly
 yah niyam ek janvari se lagu hoga
 It exempts VIP numbers and trains with emergency services
 is bare main mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal 8 disambar ko mantriyon or sambandhit adhikariyon kii ek baithak bhi bula rahe hai
 Who said what? BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said that this would cause problems for people doing their work, doctors and lawyers, who need a private car to reach quickly
 vahiin, congress mahasachiv shakeel ahamed ne kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar kaa faisla sasti lokapriyata batorna he
 The common man will be troubled by this decision
 chetan bhagat bhi virodh memlekhak chetan bhagat ne bhi kejariwal sarkaar ke is faisle kaa virodh kiya he
 He has called it a thoughtless, undemocratic, unenforceable and strange step
 saath hi kaha he ki yah is samasya kaa koi asal samaadhaan nahin he
 Draconian, undemocratic, not implementable, not a real solution, bizarre
 Odd even cars kind of posturing politics should be avoided
 Please— Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat) December 5, 2015 Bhagat also suggested solution: Chetan Bhagat has said in the next tweet that the real solution to Delhi's pollution is improvement in small cities, good emission laws and better public transport system
 Real solution to Delhi pollution is to improve smaller cities
 Lower pressure on supermetros
 Good emission norms, great public transport
 - Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat) December 5, 2015 Sunita Narayanan supported: Environmentalist Sunita Narayanan has supported the Delhi government's move

 prayog ke aadhaar par sarkaar 15 dinon tak yah dekhne kii koshish karegi ki yah kaamyaab hota he yaa nahin he
 The biggest question - how will it be implemented? Currently, the biggest question ahead of Delhi is how this decision will be implemented
 sabase badi chunauti vibhinn agenciyon se talmail kii hogi
 The implementation of this will be on the Delhi Police, which is under the Center and the BJP is already opposing it

 lambey samay se ritred ardhsainik bal puraani pension yojana ko lagu karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 These paramilitary forces are now mobilizing at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on March 3 to meet their demand
 desh ke alag-alag hisson se aa rahe in ritred javaanon kii maang he ki sarkaar vartmaan pension skim NPS ko hataakar puraani pension yojana lagu kare
 But the question is why there is a demand to end the new pension scheme
 is yojana se ardhsainik balon kii jeb ko kitna jhatka lagata he
 Today we will give information about it in this report
 puraani pension yojana or NPS kaa antavgar puraani pension yojana kii baat karen to iske tahat sena or ardhsainik balon ko ek tarah kii pension milti thi
 The pension in the old scheme is determined according to the last basic salary and inflation data of the government employee
 lekin saal 2004 se lagu hui nai pension skim ( NPS) kaa nirdhaaran kul jamaa raashi or nivesh par aae ritern ke anusaar hota he
 However, there are some facilities available under the NPS which were not available in the old scheme
 masalan, NPS main sarkaar kaa yogadan karmchaariyon kii basic selary kaa 14 fisadi hoga
 At the same time, tax exemption on the amount to be deposited under this scheme has been brought under the ambit of Section 80C of Income Tax
 yah suvidha puraani pension skim main nahin thi
 Reasons for the old scheme demand Actually, the paramilitary forces are demanding the restoration of the old pension scheme mainly because there is no contribution of employees and there is a guarantee of fixed pension
 jabaki nai pension skim main ritern sthani nahin hota he
 This means that if the returns are not good in the new scheme, the people getting pension can also suffer loss
 jabaki acha ritern rahaa to provident fund or pension kii puraani skim kii tulana main nae karmchaariyon ko ritairement ke samay bhavishya main acchhee dhanrashi bhi mil sakati he
 But retired paramilitary forces want to avoid risk games
 bataa den ki sarkaar ne janvari 2004 main sarkari karmchaariyon ke liye neshnal pension skim launch kii thi
 Since its arrival, all the government employees who were appointed started coming under the NPS instead of the old pension scheme
 kaise hota he NPS kaa istemaalaunfsh ke tahat koi bhi sarkari karmchaaree apane kaarykaal ke dauraan ek pension acount main nivesh kar saktaa he
 At the same time, the account holder can withdraw 75% of his lump sum on retirement
 vahiin baaki dhanrashi se koi vaarshik plan kharid saktaa he jisamen maheene kii niyamit aay kii vyavastha ho sake

 It often happens that if something is done every day, then people gradually stop looking at it
 petrol kii keemte badhaane ke maamle main centre sarkaar ne yahi ranneeti apanaai or lagata he ki uski yah tarkeeb sachmuch kaamyaab rahi he
 There was a time that even a hike of 50 paise or ₹ 1 in petrol prices would create uproar and the entire opposition would have raised the sky, but you too will be surprised to think that in the last 2 months, petrol prices will be 5 The rupee has increased by 42 paise and no one has even noticed
 isaki vajah yah rahi ki 16 june se sarkaar ne puure desh main tel kii keemton ke maamle main "dynamik ful prising" lagu kiya tha
 Simply put, this means that since 16 June, oil prices increase or decrease according to the price of crude oil every day
 pehle har 15 din ke baad tel kii keemton main kachche tel kii keemat ke aadhaar par badlaav kiya jaataa tha
 After the change of June 16 about fixing the prices of oil, the customers were in profit for the first few days
 pehle 13 dinon tak petrol kii keemat main dhire- dhire 3
 45 rupees decreased by Rs
 vahiin uske baad sepetrol kii keemtaaise badhani shuru hui ki 28 june se 24 agast ke bich main petrol kii keemat dilli main ₹5
 42 paise has been increased
 28 june ke baad se petrol kii keemat ek aadh baar bich-bich main do chaar paise kam jarur hui lekin ab yah dilli main 68
 88 per liter
 isi tarah dijal kii keemat kii baat karen to 1 july se lekar 24 agast ke bich main dijal kii keemat 3 rupaye 72 paise prati litre bad chuki he
 Diesel price in Delhi on 24 August 57 per liter
 06 paise prati litre pahunch chuki he
 After all, there is confusion about what is the reason for the continuous increase in precious
 jaahir he isaki sabase badi vajah to antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemten hai
 On June 27, the price of crude oil in the international market was 45
 42 dollar prati bairal thi
 Which increased to 50 on 23 August
 51 dollar prati bairal pahunch chuki he
 However, crude oil prices are not the only reason for the increase in petrol prices
 graahak tak pahunchane se pehle tel ke uparcentre or rajya sarkarentarah tarah kaa tex lagaati hai
 It causes a rise in prices
 jaisaa ki aapako maaloom hoga ki jiesti lagu hone ke baavjood tel ko iske daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 This is because a large part of the income of both the central and state government comes from the tax imposed on oil
 agar kabhi aap cricket match dekhne gaye honge or khaane pine kii koi cheez stadium ke bheetar kharidi hogi to aapako ye jarur yaad hoga kii vahaan keemat aksar anaap-shanaap hoti he
 The water bottle which is found just outside the stadium for 20 rupees has to be paid twice the price inside the stadium
 lekin ab aisa nahin hoga
 Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that the BCCI has agreed that now the drinking water bottle will be available inside the stadium at the same price as the one found outside the stadium
 yani ab stadium ke baahar or bheetar usee pani kii bottle ke liye alag-alag keemat nahin ho sakegi
 Apart from this, Pepsi, a company that manufactures drinking water bottles in the name of Aquafina, has told the ministry that now it will sell bottles of drinking water everywhere in the country at the same price
 upabhokta mantralay lambey samay se is baat kii muhim chalaa rahaa he ki ek hi cheez ke liye alag-alag jagahon par alag alag MRP nahin ho sakati
 When asked about the strict implementation of this, Ram Vilas Paswan admitted that this is still happening but he said that action is being taken from where complaints come
 upabhoktaaon ke liye ek or acchhee khabar he
 If you are upset with the service charge added to the bill forcefully in all the restaurants, then the government is going to take steps for this also
 hotel or restaurant ke maalik sarvice charge ke bare main ye tark dete hai ki ye advance main vasula jane vaala tip he jise hotel ke karmchaariyon main baant diya jaataa he
 Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan clearly said that it is wrong to collect a service charge in this way
 tip dena yaa naa dena graahak kii marji par hona chahie
 For this, the government has prepared guidelines, which have been sent to the Prime Minister's Office for approval
 pehle se hi ye baat charchaa main he ki kyasarkaar khaane kii barbaadirokane ke liye hotalon se ye kah sakati he ki wo zarurat ke mutabik hi khaanaa graahakon ko parose
 The government wants to stop the waste of mines but the owners of hotels and restaurants consider it to interfere in their functioning
 shuukravaar ko ramvilas paswan ne is bare main hotel association se meeting kii
 The government made it clear that it is not intended to interfere in prices
 lekin, graahak ko ye hona chahie ki wo jitani jarurat ho utana hi khaanaa manga sake
 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee expressed concern that the continuing political crisis in West Asia would have serious policy implications for rising oil prices, but expressed confidence that the situation would be dealt with
 bharat ko apni jarurat kaa do-tihaai kaccha tel videsh se mangana padataa he
 In such a situation, its price rise will be considered as bad news for the government, as it will have to choose between two difficult options like increasing spending on subsidies or making unpopular decision to increase the price burden on consumers to deal with the situation
 mukherjee ne rigerv bank board kii baithak ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha, vishwa arthvyavastha kii haalat main dhime sudhaar, pashchim asia tathaa uttari africa main raajnneetik uthapatak se upji anischitata bhartiya niti nirdharakon ke liye gambhir chunautiyaan khadi kar sakati he
 It is noteworthy that in the international market, crude oil prices have touched a high of $ 116 per barrel
 vitt mantralay ne 2011-12 main tel sabsidi mad main kharch 23,640 karod rupee rahane kaa anumaan lagaaya he, jabaki maujuuda vittvarsh main is mad par 38,386 karod rupee kharch kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 If crude oil prices continue to rise, the government will have to spend more money on subsidies
 bharat kaa tel aayaat janvari main 7
 8 percent to 7
 85 arab dollar ho gaya, jisase april-janvari 2010-11 main aayaat bill badhkar 79
 95 billion dollars
 mukherjee ne kaha, main aapako aashwaasan dilaanaa chaahunga ki rigerv bank ke saath paraamarsh kar ham is chunauti kaa saamana kar lenge
 
 
 i believe it
 vishwa arthvyavastha ke bare main unhone kaha ki america jaise viksit deshon kii arthvyavastha kaa haal sudhar rahaa he par ireland, spain or portugal jaise euro kshetra ke kuch deshon kii sarkaron ke paas rin chukaane ke liye dhan kaa sankat he
 Mukherjee said that it remains to be seen how the debt crisis of these countries will affect the other countries of Europe
 mukherjee ne kaha ki europe kii teevr arthik vruddhi khud bharat ke liye jaruri he

 While the Congress had come up with a no-confidence motion against Rajendra Trivedi, the speaker of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly, today the two have reached an agreement after a meeting between the Gujarat government and the Congress
 bijepi ne jahaan gujarat vidhansabha main marpet karne vaale teen congress vidhayakon ke suspension ko radd kar use keval is vidhansabha turm ke liye kar diya he vahiin congress ne gujarat vidhansabha main spikar rajendra trivedi ke khilaaf daayar kiya avishvaas kaa prastaav waapas liya he
 Significantly, there was an uproar in the Gujarat Assembly over the discussion on the death of two children at Asaram Ashram in which Congress mlas Pratap Dudhat, Amrish Der and Baldev Thakor were suspended by Speaker Rajendra Trivedi
 jisamen pratap dudhaat or amrish der ko teen saal ke liye jabaki baldev thakor koek saal ke liye suspendakia gaya tha
 However, the Congress had expressed its opposition on this matter, saying that according to the parliamentary system, the speaker does not have the right to suspend the representative elected by the public for three years
 iske baad congress vidhansabha main spikar rajendra trivedi ke liye avishvaas kaa prastaav lekar ai thi
 However, there should be any discussion in the Assembly on this issue, it was already held today (tuesday) between the leaders of the government and the Congress and in the meeting, both the parties agreed to the terms of each other, BJP suspended the suspension of the three mlas
 When limited to this term only, Shailesh Parmar of the Congress withdrew the no-confidence motion brought for the speaker
 dalip singh urf khali ke nijee surakshakarmi dwaara bheed par goli chalaane se do log ghayal ho gaye
 a case has been registered against Khali's security personnel after the incident
 surakshakarmiyon ne kathith taur par khali ke liye rasta banane ke makasad se goliyaan chalaayin thim
 Commissioner of Police Ishwar Singh said that a case has been registered against the security personnel under Section 307 (attempt to murder) and Section 25 of the Arms Act
 ab tak kisi kii giraftaar nahin hui he
 The commissioner said that Khali had come to the house of senior BJP leader and Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Satpal Gosain on Friday night where his fans gathered

 dakshin africa ke khilaaf test siries main keval murali vijay acchhee ballebaaji kar rahe hai baaki sabhi batsmen apane kad ke mutabik ballebaaji nahin kar sake hai
 It is believed that Sunil Gavaskar, the former captain and commentator of the team
 gavaskar ne salaami ballebaaj murali vijay ko chhodkar bhartiya team ke sheersh kram ke anya sabhi ballebaajon ke pradarshan kii aalochana kii he
 Nagpur Test team India managed to score 215 runs in the first innings and asked about the performance of the specialist batsmen in such a situation, Parsunil Gavaskar said, "except for Murali Vijay who was out with the best ball, the rest of the performances were not as expected
 anya ballebaaj vah shot khelkar out hue jinhone aisa ballebaaj nahin kheltaa to aatmavishvaas se bharaa hota or ran bana rahaa hota
 'gavaskar said,' Vijay is scoring runs and that is why he is giving up balls so well after the off stump
 vah apni of stump ko lekar aashwast he
 Given the nature of the pitch, Gavaskar definitely gave 215 runs as a good score but refused to rate it as equal to 400 runs
 unhone kaha, ‘215 acha score he
 Usually the first and second days are the best for batting but if you say that it is equal to 400 runs then maybe it is not so
 215 ran ab tak pari main sarvaadhik score he isliye ravindra jadeja or riddhimaan saaha kii saajhedaari ko kaaphi shrey jaataa he
 If they did not score this run (48 runs), India could have piled on 175 runs
 ’ England's Stuart Broad is considered to be his country's next superstar player
 yahi nahin stuart broad kii ginati ab ian botham or andru filntoff jaise harfanmaulaa khilaadiyon ke saath bhi hone lagi he
 Before this series, there was a question about Broad's selection, but this entire series has changed Broad's career
 gend or balle donon se hi broad ne kamaal kar dikhaaya he
 Broad has taken 19 wickets in five innings so far
 inke naam 182 ran jo ki is siries main sachin, lakshmana or dhoni se bhi zyada hai
 On the other hand, team player Tim Brasenan is also going through his most wonderful phase these days
 unhen england team kaa lucky charm mana ja rahaa he
 Brasenon's place in the team was made when Chris Tramlat was ruled out due to injury but Brasnan justified his selection as soon as he arrived
 pehle to gendbaaji main basanan ne duusare test match kii duusari pari main 5 wicket liye or phir tisare test match kii pehali pari main 4 wicket chatkaaye
 Not only this, even with the bat, Brasenin beat the Indian bowlers a lot
 abhi tak bresanan ne 3 pariyon main 11 wicket liye hai
 This is Brasnan's 9th Test match and the 8 Test matches he has played before have all won England
 supreme court ab se kuch hi dinon menadharaki anivaaryta par apana antim faisla sunaane ja rahi he
 But before this, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the organization that operates the world's largest biometric database, has decided to make facial recognition mandatory to ensure the security of the Aadhaar number system
 facial rikgnishan ko anivaary karne se ab jin sevaaon ke liye aadhaar kii anivaaryta hai masalan banking, mobile oparator or sarkari yojanaon kaa laabh ke liye ab aadhaar othentication karaane ke liye facial rikgnishan karana hoga
 However, the Aadhaar data held by UIDAI does not yet contain the facial recognition data of any citizen
 UIDAI ke mutabik ab kevaisi karaate vakt photo dene ke saath-saath aadhaar othentication ke liye ab on-spot photo bhi khinchi jaaegi
 UIDAI has claimed that the facilitation of facial recognition will further improve the current authentication process
 philhal aadhaar othentication ke liye aankh kii putali (iris othentication) or ungali ke nishaan (fingerprint othentication) or mobile phone ke jariye otipiothentificationaki prakriya kii jaati he
 It is to be noted that this process is being done on the basis of a circular issued by the UIDAI on August 17, 2018
 UIDAI ke mutabik isse aadhaar kaarykram ko adhik samaveshi banaaya ja sakegaa
 This step will make Aadhaar authentication easier for those who face difficulty in Aadhaar verification through fingerprint
 gauratlab he ki desh main bujurg jansankhya ke saath-saath zyaadaatar mazdooron kaa fingerprint ke jariye othentification karaane main dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 UIDAI has said that the use of this new technology will be gradually incorporated into the system
 lihaaja, mana ja rahaa he ki is aadesh ke jariye UIDAI ab desh main nagarikon kaa facial rikgnishan data ekatra karegi jisase ise prayog main laayaa ja sake
 Read this: China 100 per cent and Modi government not even 1 per cent in giving new jobs: According to Rahul Gandhi, Government has issued instructions to all telecom service providers in the country to use facial recognition technology as soon as possible for Aadhaar verification Start telecom prowiders ko altimetum bhi diya gaya he ki 15 sitambar, 2018 tak vah kam se kam apane kul masik tranjaction kaa 10 fisadi othentification facial rikgnishan ke jariye karaaen nahin to prati tranjaction unase ek nunatam charge vasula jayega
 It has also been warned through the circular that non-adherence to this rule is an offense under the Aadhaar Act 2016 and if found guilty under it will be punished with imprisonment and fine or both
 aisi sthiti main sawaal khadaa hota he ki philhal bujurg jansankhya or lebar varg ke liye shuru kii ja rahi is facial rikgnishan vyavastha ko puure desh main lagu karne ke liye kya ek baar phir UIDAI ko sabhi nagarikon kaa sample lene ke liye qatari main khadaa karnaa hoga? kyonki jabatak UIDAI ke paas yah sample maujuud nahin he vah facial rikgnishan ke jariye othentication ke kaam ko kaise prabhavi karegi

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke france ke saansadon ke ek pratinidhimandal se bhent ke samay yah mudda uthaa
 The delegation was led by Claude Batolone, president of the National Assembly
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktasaiyad akbaruddin ne bataaya,'francisi pratinidhimandal ke ek sadsy ne pakistan main lakhvi kii rihaai ko durbhypurna bataaya or kaha ki yah bharat yaa vishwa donon ke liye acha nahin he
 'he said,' France expresses solidarity with India on this issue
 ' lashkar e taiyaba ke aaparishan commander lakhvi ko lagbhag chah saal kii giraftaar ke baad aaj pakistan kii jail se chhod diya gaya
 Akbaruddin said that Lakhvi's case arose during the discussion with the delegation about cooperation on the anti-terrorism issue
 is bare main france ke ruukh par pratikriya karte hue modi ne pratinidhimandal se kaha, 'bharat ke liye aapane jo chintaa jataai he or jo vednaa darshai he vah hamaare saajha vichaaron ko vyakt karti he
 The Prime Minister said that India and France have a shared vision on terrorism
 unhone kaha ki france ne jab bhi aatanki hamale kaa saamana kiya puraa bharat uske khilaaf uth khadaa hua or bharat ke khilaaf aisa kuch hone par france main bhi yahi bhaavana rahi
 The commander of lashkar-e-taiba and the 2008 Mumbai attack mastermind, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, was released today after spending nearly six years in custody
 lahore hai court (alechasi) dwaara lakhvi kii hiraasat nilambit karne or tatkaal uski rihaai kaa aadesh dene ke baad lakhvi ko rawalpindi ke adiyaala jail se reeha kar diya gaya
 India had reacted strongly to the court's decision, saying that it ends the price of repeated trust by Pakistan on cross-border terrorism
 55 saal ke lakhvi kii agavani ke liye jamaat ud daawa ke samarthak jail ke baahar khadey the
 The court yesterday suspended the Punjab government's order to detain Lakhvi under a security act and ordered his immediate release
 isse pehle aaj lakhvi ke vakil raja rigwan abbasi ne pitiai-bhashaa se kaha tha ki sarkaar ke paas unke muvakkil ko reeha karne ke alaava koi doosraa kanoonee vikalp nahin bachaa he
 Abbasi said, "after the LHC dismisses my client's custody, the government has no other legal option than to release him
 naa to sarkaar or naa hi adiyaala jail prashasan is samay adaalat ke aadesh kaa ulanghan kar sakate hai
 Lakhvi and six others have been booked for planning and executing the 2008 Mumbai attack
 is hamale main 166 log maare gaye the jabaki 300 se zyada ghayal hue the
 Lakhvi, a close relative of Hafiz Saeed, founder of lashkar-e-taiba and head of Jamaat-ud Dawa, was arrested in December 2008

 After the Lahore High Court ordered the release of Lakhvi on Thursday, the newspaper Nation in its editorial on Friday said, "pakistan has failed once again to prosecute Lakhvi
 keval naakaam hi nahin, aisa lagata he ki is baar usne apni taraf se puraa prayaas bhi nahin kiya
 'the newspaper has said,' On the one hand when the country is fighting terrorism, in such a situation, blaming Lakhvi against terrorism would have been a great achievement for the country
 ' sampadakeey ke mutabik, november 2008 main 166 bhartiya va videshi nagarikon kii hatya ke liye jimmedaar tehraae gaye lakhvi kii rihaai se pakistan ke netaaon dwaara aatank ke khilaaf die gaye saare bhaashan khokhale sabit hue hai
 The newspaper has said, 'the hypocrisy is so clear that it embarrasses the thinking of the public
 'lekh ke mutabik, 'kai saal tak sunwaayee isliye talati rahi, kyonki suraksha sambandhi chintaa ke maddenjar na nyaayadhish or na hi gavaah or na hi aaropee adaalat main upasthit ho paae

 Once started, the fast will have to be taken, both the characters of the Taumris fast are either Kumari Kanya or Suhagin women
 lekin ek baar vrath rakhane baad jivan bhar is vrath ko rakhana padataa he
 If the fasting woman is in a serious condition, then there is a law to keep this fast in exchange for another woman or her husband

 In this puja, idols of shiva-parvati are duly worshiped and the story of Firathaalika Teejki is recited
 mata parvati par suhaag kaa sara saamaan chadhaaya jaataa he
 There is a belief among devotees that Lord Shiva himself protects the good fortune of the one who performs all the sins and the worldly heat in order to fast the Haratalika fast

 Why Paraharatalika is composed of the words Tejnamaharatalikado, green and table
 harith kaa arth he haran karnaa or talika arthath sakhi
 This festival is celebrated on the Shukla Tritiya of Bhadrapada, due to which it is called Teej
 is vrath ko haritalika isliye kaha jaataa he, kyoki parvati kii sakhi (mitra) unhen pita ke ghar se haran kar jangal main le gai thi
 According to a legend in the Kathaling Purana, the hartalika Teej, Maa Parvati, in her early birth, meditated in her childhood on the banks of the Ganges on the Himalayas to receive Lord Shankar as her husband
 is dauraan unhone ann kaa seven nahin kiya
 For many years he spent only by drinking air
 mata parvati kii yah sthiti dekhakar unke pita atyant dukhi the
 Meanwhile, one day Maharishi Narada approached Parvati's father on behalf of Lord Vishnu with the proposal of marriage of Parvati ji, which she accepted with pleasure
 pita ne jab maa parvati ko unke vivaah kii baat batalaai to vah bahut dukhi ho gai or jor-jor se vilaap karne lagi
 Then on the request of a Sakhi, Mother told her that she is doing this harsh fast to get Lord Shiva as a husband while her father wants to marry her to Vishnu
 tab saheli kii salaah par mata parvati ghaney van main chali gai or vahaan ek gupha main jaakar bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana main leen ho gai
 On the day of Bhadrapada Tritiya Shukla, Hath Nakshatra was built by Shiva with sand by Mata Parvati and immersed in the praise of Bholenath and awakened the night
 tab mata ke is kathor tapasya se prasann hokar bhagwaan shiv ne unhen darshan die or icchaanusaar unako apni patni ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 It is believed that on this day, women who perform this fast lawfully and with full devotion, get a husband according to their mind

 Rajesh Garg, MLA from Rohini assembly constituency of Aam Aadmi Party, has written a letter to party chief Arvind Kejriwal accusing him of promoting corrupt people and not understanding the pain and suffering of party workers
 rajesh garg ne chitthee main yah bhi naseehat di he ki dilli vidhansabha bhang karne kii maang karne se pehle arvind kejariwal ko janata ke bich jaakar raishumaari karwaani chahie thi
 The open letter written by AAP MLA Rajesh Garg to party chief Arvind Kejriwal is as follows
 
 
 aadarneey aravind kejariwal ji, vandemaataram! aap sach ko sweekaaren or party me paise waalon va bhrasht logon ko badhaava dena band karen
 Try to understand the pain and suffering of the ordinary worker of Aam Aadmi Party, who actually came to sacrifice everything against corruption, but don't know why, AAP and Ashutosh ji are BJP mps and Punjab Kesari newspaper Editor of Ashwini Kumar Chopra silent about land scams worth billions of rupees? aap dilli main baar-baar vidhansabha bhang karne kii jab maang karte hai, to kaaryakartaaon par, janata par or chune hue sabhi dalon ke vidhayakon par kya-kya guzarati he, kabhi aapane sochaa he? swaraj niti ke antargat yadi aap dilli main chunaav hon yaa nahin - is bare main koi nirnay lene se pehle yadi janata ke bich raishumaari kara lete to matadaataaon main zyaada acha sandesh jaataa
 
 
 The rest is your wish
 
 
 har samay janata ke bich rahata hum, or janata kii bhaavana se aapako avgat karana meraa ferj tha, jo himmat karke maine puraa kar diya he
 If we had done this courage during the assembly session on February 14, 2014, we would have been serving the people of Delhi today, because we are not able to do anything due to lack of government
 dilli main sarkaar banani chahie, chaahe kisi kii bhi bane
 We came to serve faithfully as patriots, not to do politics for power! Today, we should think about saving the people of Delhi from the economic burden of Rs 1,000 crore by taking them out of the election situation and not by insisting on repeated elections
 
 
 kya ham vipaksh main baithkar acha kaam nahin kar sakate? ek baat par or dhyaan dene kii jarurat he ki yadi dobaaraa chunaav ke baad bhi kisi ek dal ko spasht bahumat nahin mila to ham janata ko kya jawaab denge
 
 
 This is also a matter of thinking
 
 
 baaki aapaki marzi
 
 
 Always with you, Rajesh Garg / you Rohini ab is khule patr ke bahut-se matlab nikaale ja sakate hai, kyonki iske baad ek ore jahaan arvind kejariwal par sawaal uth rahe hai, vahiin sawaal aap ke is vidhayak par bhi uthanaa lazimi he
 The question to Arvind Kejriwal is, will he still say that all his mlas want elections by dissolving the Delhi Assembly? aap vidhayak par sawaal ye he ki paramparaagat rup se bijepi kii seat maane jane vaali rohinee seat jo aap vidhayak rajesh garg ne 2013 main jeet lee thi kya wo is par chunaav main haar jane ke dar se chunaav nahin chaahate or party line ke khilaaf baat kar rahe hai? As soon as this matter came up, MLA Rajesh Garg was away from the reach of the media, so only he was confirmed on the phone that he had written the letter
 jabaki party ne kaha he ki unako abhi tak koi khat nahin mila he, aise main vidhayak se baat karne ke baad hi is par or isamen uthaae muddon par koi pratikriya de paaenge
 The party did not have a good answer to the kind of letter Kejriwal has written to his MLA to avoid trouble
 ant main sirf ek baat kahana chaahunga ki ''apano se saavdhaan gairon se nipat lenge'' ye baat aam aadmi party par bilkul feet baithti he
 During his two-year lifetime, the party was not harassed or harmed by his enemies as much as his own

 He said that Chhattisgarh High Court has already dismissed the matter due to the appointment
 udhar congress ne bhi apni pratikriya jaahir karte hue kaha he ki is maamle main wo yachikakarta ke saath hai
 The party argues that the parliamentary secretary in Chhattisgarh is under the purview of the post of profit
 rajya main kul 90 siton main bijepi ke paas 49, congress ke paas 36, BSP ke paas ek or ek anya ke paas hai
 If the membership of 11 mlas ends, then the BJP government will come in a minority
 rajya main isi varsh vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Therefore, the BJP is taking the matter seriously with the help of strategic legal claims

 Maharashtra observer and Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has expressed hope that the BJP and Shiv Sena will find a way to form a government in Maharashtra

 He said that what the party has said is my stand too
 bataa den ki chunaav nateezon ke baad devendra fadanvis ne kaha tha ki 50-50 formule main siem pad nahin he
 Since this statement of Fadnavis, Shiv Sena's attitude has come to the fore and she is constantly talking about walking on a different path from BJP
 haalanki, shivasena ke dabaav ke baad bijepi ne use cabinet kaa ek nayaa ofer bhi de diya he, jisamen dipti siem samet PWD jaise baari-bharkam mantralay bhi shaamil he
 Despite this, the picture on government formation so far is not clear

 Photo journalist Pablo Bathurlomev, who took a heart-wrenching picture of a child who was victimized by the Bhopal gas tragedy, is disheartened 26 years after the world's biggest industrial accident
 unka kahana he ki haal hi main aayaa adalati faisla sirf ek dhong he
 Bathurlomev had taken a picture of a child who had been buried up to the neck and his face was visible
 unke dwaara khinchi gai yah tasviir vishwa main bhopal gas traasadee kaa pratik ban gai jisamen 15 hajaar se adhik log maare gaye or lakhon aapng ho gaye
 this case , Bathurlomev said, "the verdict is a hypocrisy
" ’’ bhopal kii ek adaalat ne faisle main union karbaide india ke purv adhyaksh keshav mahindra sahit saat logon ko do-do varsh ke karawas kii sajaa sunai
 The award-winning photographer said in an interview, "but the issues are huge
" vaastavik samasya raahat pradaan karne main rahi he
 Rehabilitation programs were initiated which were abruptly halted
 koi nahin jaanata kyon
 Forget about financial compensation, even there is a question mark on medical help for the victims
 ’’bathrelomev ne kaha ‘‘aaj asal chunauti bhopal main maujuuda peedi ke punarvaas ko lekar he jahaan ab bhi hawa main jaharila rasayan maujuud he
 He said that the events related to the tragedy raise many questions on the entire governance system of the country
 varsh 1984 ke liye ‘world press photo of da year’ puraskaar praapt karne vaale bathrelomev ne kaha ‘‘maujuuda halaat desh or isaki sthiti ke bare main bahut se sawaal uthaate hai jo bhaybheet karne vaale hai
 Recalling his experiences trying to report the Bhopal gas leak from behind the lens, he said that it was like a driving force in many ways in his life
 unhone kaha ‘‘samoochee ghatana or us bachche kii chhavi ne asal main mujhe utsahit kiya or kai myanon main yah meri jindagi main prerak bal kii tarah rahaa
 Though this experience frightened me but made me aware of many complexities which continue even today and the world does not take lessons from them
 ’’ haalanki is traasadee ko do dashak se adhik samay ho chukaa he lekin iskaa ek-ek pal bathrelomev ke mastishk main ankit he
 Bathurlomev said, "that night i was in Patna
 maine sabase pehle radio par samachar suna or shuru main ise nazarandaaj kar diya
 But the number of dead was increasing
 i saw heart-wrenching pictures of dead bodies on TV which were being carried in large numbers on the bales
 is ghatnakram ne mujhe jhakzor kar rakh diya or maine bhopal jane kaa faisla kiya
 He arrived in Bhopal on December 5, two days after the incident
 unhone kaha ‘‘jab main aspataal pahunchaa to har ore shav bikhare pade the
 It was quite frightening to see the bodies of children, most of whom had become deformed
 ’’ bathrelomev ne kaha ‘‘kyonki vahaan photography par roak laga di gai thi isliye maine shmashaan jane kaa faisla kiya jahaan aspataal se shavon se bhare trek aa rahe the
 This was where i saw the young child who was half buried

 baba ram rahim
 must have heard the name
 chehre se bhi achche se waakif honge or waakif honge bhi to kyon nahin
 Because Baba is also a hero
 lekin ab baba par machaa he bavaal
 We are telling you the full facts of why, how, and where
 punjab se lekar haryana tak, baba ram rahim ke liye mahilaayein, noujvaan, bujurg ghar-baar chhodkar sadakon par aa gaye hai
 The police got suffocated, no one understood what was happening
 deraa sachcha sauda pramukh baba gurmeet ram rahim ke khilaaf sadhvi se rape cese main 25 agast ko court kaa faisla aane vaala he
 Panchkula CBI court has to pronounce verdict on Baba, but Panchkula has been converted into a fort before the date
 suraksha main puri palaton tainatpulice or para military force kii palaton kii palaton tainaat ho chuki hai
 Ram Rahim's supporters are saying that he will not allow his Baba's hair to be too dull
 panchkula main hi nahin, haryana ke fatehabad se lekar panipat, sangrur tak deraa sachcha sauda ke samarthak baba ke liye gharon se nikal aae hai
 Some are chanting slogans, some are threatening, some have poles in their hands
 bhakton kii dhamkee- faisla baba ke khilaaf aayaa to bura hoga anjambaba ram rahim par 2007 se ye cese chal rahaa he
 The dera has a camp on the outskirts of Sirsa in Haryana
 25 agast ko panchkula sibiai court faisla sunayegi
 But Baba's supporters have threatened before the verdict
 agar faisla baba ke virodh main gaya to anjaam bura hoga
 It is being said that Baba's supporters have also collected diesel, petrol and stones
 paanch karod bhakt, america se lekar australia tak samrajyadera sachcha sauda ashram lagbhag 68 saalon se chal rahaa he
 It is said that the empire of Dera Sacha Sauda extends from the country to abroad
 america, canada, england, australia or to or buei tak iske ashram or anuyaayi hai
 The claim is even made that the dera has around five crore followers worldwide
 jinamein se kareeb 25 lakh anuyaayi to akele haryana main hai
 Looking at the ruckus on the temporary jail, the Haryana government has come on full alert
 25 agast ko ram rahim par faisle ke chalate chandigarh main sector 16 ke cricket stadium ko bhi asthai jail main badla ja rahaa he
 Ramdeem celebrates birthday, luxury vehicles, on 15th August Ram Rahim celebrated his 50th birthday on 15 August
 wo lagjri gadiyon ke kafile main chalate hai
 Trains are covered up somewhere
 yahaan tak pataa nahin chalata ki baba baithe kis gaadi main he
 Bodyguards in security are also visible
 filmon ke shauqin he baba
 
 
 Baba is also fond of films
 ek, do nahin
 
 balki paanch filmon main bataur lead actor kaam kar chuke hai
 His films from MSG to Jattu Engineer have also been successful
 23 kii umr main bane deraa pramukhapako bataa den ki 1967 main rajasthan ke sriganganagar main jat sikh parivaar main janmen baba ram rahim ko tatkaaleen deraa pramukh satnam singh ne 23 sitambar 1990 main apana vaaris ghoshit kiya tha
 Then the popularity of the dera started to grow under the leadership of Baba Ram Rahim
 baba ram rahim kaa deraa sachcha sauda saamaajik samarasata badhaane, nashamukthi or maanavseva se lekar sarvadharm sambhaav kaa sandesh detaa he
 Therefore, the number of their followers is also increasing
 deraa or baba ram rahim se jude vivaadon kii fehrist kuch aisi he
 
 
 The year 2001 - Sexual abuse case with Sadhvi, the year 2002 - The murder of journalist Ramchandra, the year 2003 - The Dera's management committee member Ranjit Singh murder case 2007 - The dispute with the Sikhs on the veneer of Guru Gobind Singh 2010 - The disappearance of former Dera manager Fakir Chand Case 2012 - Accusation of imprisoning 400 deer Sadhus loksabhaa chunaavon main pradhanmantri narendra modi or unke vikaas kaaryo par desh kii janata ne bharosa jataayaa, jiske kaaran bijepi ne pehali baar 300 siton ke aankade ko paar kiya
 The BJP was confident of its easy victory in the elections to Maharashtra and Haryana after the Lok Sabha, as the BJP had won a massive victory in the elections held 4 months earlier, but the results of the assembly elections forced the BJP leadership to think
 They gave, because in these elections neither the people voted on the matter of development nor in the name of Article 370
 bhaajapa ke liye ab nai pareshaani yah bhi hai ki uski sahyogi partiyaan lagaataar uskaa saath chhod raheen hai, maharashtra main jahaan shivasena ne 33 saal puraane gathbandhan ko tod diya to jharkhad main bhaajapa kii 20 saal puraani sahyogi party ajasu ne chunaavon se ain vakt pehle seat bantwaare ko lekar gathbandhan tod diya
 So the question is, how will the BJP once again be able to seat the non-tribal chief minister in this tribal state? In the 2014 assembly elections in Jharkhand, both the Congress and JMM contested separately, but this time the two parties fought together
 At the same time, in the last elections, BJP contested with Azus and LJP, but this time the party's alliance has broken
 vahi jeviem jisane 2019 loksabhaa chunaav congress or jeemem ke saath chunaav ladaa tha, vah pehali baar akele sabhi vidhansabha siton par apane ummidavaar utaar raheen hai
 Ravish Kumar's blog: Modi made the accused of 95,000 crores Maharashtra's Deputy Chief Minister BJP Congress + JMM + rjdchange 31

 Such as royalty on coal, income from raw iron is the main source of income of the government
 sakshartaa ke hisaab se pichhade is pradesh main sarkaar ne padhai par khaasaa dhyaan diya
 There are famous institutions like Beats, NIT, Indian School of Mines, IIM in the state
 vahiin, agar baat kare mukhyamantri ke kaaryo kii to khud pradhanmantri narendra modi or party adhyaksh amit shah unki kai baar taareef kar chuke hai
 Due to the cooperation of senior leaders, Raghuvar Das, without coming from any political family, is establishing himself in the politics of the state
 ab agar baat 2019 loksabhaa chunaavon ke parinaamon kii baat kare to kul 14 siton main se 11 par bijepi ne jeet darj hasil kii thi, vahi 1 seat par uski sahyogi party ajasu,congress or jeemem ne jeet darj kiya tha
 If you look at the Lok Sabha elections according to the assembly results, here BJP and AJSU are seen sweeping the Congress alliance in the entire state
 lekin yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki maharashtra or haryana main loksabhaa chunaavon kaa vidhansabha parinaamon ke hisaab se dekhe to congress gathbandhan ko 288 seat main se (56 siten) or 90 seat main se (10 siten) mil rahi thi, lekin vidhansabha chunaavon ke parinaam ham sabake saamne he
 So while analyzing, we have to keep in mind that the results of the Lok Sabha elections should not be proved in the same way in the assembly elections, because in both elections, the public examines the leaders and issues separately
 bijepi+ajasukanges+jeemem+ argedy6318 The dates for the state elections have been announced
 is baar janata 5 charnon main apane janpratinidhiyon ko chunegin, lekin is baar kii raajnneetik ladaai hemanth sorain ke liye bhi bahut hi mahatvapurn hai, kyonki is baar kaa vidhansabha chunaav congress or vipakshi partiyaan unke hi netritv main chunaav lard raheen he
 Therefore it becomes very important that he can establish himself in the politics of the state

 The court then adjourned the hearing of the case till 28 October
 khandpeeth ne abhiyojan paksh ko bhi nirdesh diya tha ki vah doshi mukesh se sambandhit dastavej sharma ko muhaiyaa karaae

 bjp's firebrand leader and Union Minister Uma Bharti attended the 'aaj Tak' flagship show 'sidhi Baat' aired on Sunday
 is dauraan unhone mashhoor ankar shweta singh ke sawaalon ke khulkar jawaab die
 Uma Bharti, who holds the responsibility of the Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in the Modi government, spoke on all issues from the Ram temple to the withdrawal of the Ganga ministry
 is dauraan bijepi netaa uma bharti ne ganga mantralay chhine jane kii baat ko sire se khaarij kar diya
 The Union Minister said that he himself had requested BJP President Amit Shah to withdraw this ministry
 jab unase sawaal kiya gaya ki kya ganga mantralay waapas liye jane kaa aapako malaal he? is par uma bharti ne kaha, ‘‘maine oktober 2016 main kedarnath se hi amit shah ko massej kar diya tha ki ab mujhe ganga kaa mantri nahin rahanaa
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have to take over the Ganga ministry
 piemo ko ganga mantralay apane haath main lenaa padegaa
 All is done, now the time for implementation has come
 aise main pradhanmantri modi isko apane haath main le len or karen
 BJP leader Uma Bharati said that when the matter reached the Prime Minister, he said that Uma Behan should remain still
 dekhte hai, isko kaise karnaa he? phir ganga mantralay nitin gadakari ke paas chalaa gaya, wo to har cheez kaa shrey mujhe hi de dete hai
 In fact, recently Union Minister Nitin Gadkari had praised Uma Bharti for cleaning the Ganges
 unhone kaha tha ki uma bharti ne ganga safai ko lekar kaaphi acha kaam kiya
 Uma Bharti has started many such works, the result of which will be revealed very soon
 unhone kaha tha kiuma bharatisara bhojan bana chuki hai or ab unhen (gadakari ko) sirf ise saamne laakar dining teble par parosna he
 Gadkari said that as Transport Minister he understands that sometimes it takes a lot of time to prepare for a major project, take out tenders and complete legal formalities
 magar jab kaam shuru hota he, to phir nateeja saamne dikhne lagata he
 It may be known that in the central cabinet change, Uma Bharti was handed over the responsibility of Ganga ministry to Nitin Gadkari
 isi vibhaag ke tahat namaami gange jaisaa mahatvapurn vibhaag judaa he, jo pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa dream project he
 Uma Bharti now has only minor portfolios like drinking water and sanitation

 After this, he is constantly being asked to vacate the Chief Minister's house but he has refused to do so

 If they find that bungalow, there is no problem in emptying this house
 haalanki maanjhi ke is daawey se rajya sarkaar bilkul bhi ittefaq rakhti najar nahin aa rahi he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister of the state Shravan Kumar says on this matter, 'manjhi ji is aware that this bungalow situated at 1 Anne Road is officially the Chief Minister's residence
 is lihaaj se purv mukhyamantri kaa bangala na chhodana kanuunan galat he
 He hinted at action in the event of not leaving the bungalow
 unhone kaha, 'isse fark nahin padataa ki netaa kitna bada he, kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 According to sources, Manjhi has been allotted another bungalow at 12 Stand Road but the government has not received any response from him at the moment
 maanjhi ko 1 maheene main mukhyamantri awaas khaali karnaa tha lekin vah us makaan main pichley 40 dinon se jame hue hai

 Many times couples even approach a lawyer or counselor with the intention of mediation or settlement
 ab aisi hi ek mahila counslar ke paas pahunche dampatti kaa video soshal media par viral ho rahaa he
 It can be seen that the female counselor gets up from her seat while talking to the husband and wife, and makes a lot of slap on the husband
 chaar minute ke is ‘on da spot’ faisle vaale viral video ko 20 july 2018 ko ek fasebuk profile se aplod kiya gaya
 It has seen more than 10 lakh people so far
 das hajaar se zyada log ise share kar chuke hai
 Over two thousand people have responded to the video
 kai log counslar kii tarif kar rahe hai
 Some did not consider it right to take the law on their behalf on behalf of the counselor
 mahila counslar ne aakhir is tarah kyon salaah lene ke liye aae dampatti main purush kii dhunaai karne kaa kadam uthaaya? wo bhi camere par live recording ke saath
 India Today's Fact Check team decided to investigate the entire case
 recording ko dekh kar hi itnaa to pataa chal gaya ki ye sab ek offis jaise kamare main hua
 Only husband and wife and counselor are seen in the office
 counslar pehle dampatti kii baaten sunati rahati he or phir patni se mobile maang kar camere kii ore ek massej ko dikhaati he jis par ‘talaak’ likhaa hua hota he
 After this, the counselor, looking at the camera, tells the husband's name Abid Mastan and the woman's name is Shayra Abid Mastan
 iske baad wo apni seat se uthakar purush ke paas pahunch kar kahati he "tumhen kis moulana ne bolaa ki is tarah se SMS se "talaak" likh kar bhej dene se talaak ho jaataa he, tum islam ko badnaam karte ho
 "after that, the counselor gives the man several slips one after the other
 saath hi phir uske kaan bhi umethati he
 The lady counselor then comes back to her seat and narrates the decree- "let me write a letter, you take it home
" ladki ko koi bhi dikkat nahin honi chahie
 Seeing the counselor's attitude, the man could say this much- "madam, i will take my wife home
" ”video main ho rahi baatcheet kaa jo lahaza tha wo amuman mumbai yaa maharashtra main hi suna jaataa he
 The Fact Check team then turned to Mumbai to investigate the video
 khojbin se pataa chalaa ki video main dikh rahi he mahila counslar "help care foundation’ naam se NGO chalaati he
 The woman's name is Shabnam Sheikh but everyone knows her by the name of Shabnam Aapa
 shabnam shaikh se jab video ke bare poocha to unhone kaha, "video main dikh rahi baat bilkul sach he or us shaks kii pitayee hamane hi kii thi
 The girl had complained to us that her husband had sent her divorce by SMS and removed her from the house 9 months ago
 SMS par talaak likh kar bhejne vaala shaks mumbai ke ghatkoper kaa rahane vaala he
 After receiving the complaint, i called the couple to their office in Bandra on 14 July 2018
 pehle donon ke bich sulah karwaane kii koshish kii thi
 i had beaten him up on the question of getting divorced from SMS
 ab dekhie pitayee ke baad pati-patni achche se saath rahe rahe hai
 "and in the search bin, it was found that the woman, who runs an NGO in Dabang style, also runs a social worker drug de-addiction center
 inke fasebuk acount ko check kiya to dekha ki ye or bhi maamle main khud jaj banakar fariyaadiyon kii baat sunati hai or phir faisle detii hai, saath-saath puri kaarywahi ko live dikhaati bhi hai
 This viral video was also made live by Shabnam Sheikh himself from his Facebook handle
 isse pehle bhi cese ko handle karte karte shabnam shaikh aise hi auron kii pitayee kar chuki hai
 Shabnam Sheikh has also been in the news earlier
 jab big bos ke pratiyogi jubair khan ko salmaan khan ne bich sho se baahar nikaal diya tha
 At that time, Shabnam came in support of Sheikh Zubair Khan and spoke against Salman Khan
 baad main kisi baat ko lekar ravi pujari gang se 1 karod rupee kii dhamkee milane par inhen police se suraksha bhi le rakhi
 Viral test proved that what is being shown in the video is true and indeed the counselor had beaten the man on the question of SMS

 Sonam Kapoor's work in this film can be judged average, but not bad
 sonam ek samrudh filmi becoground se aati hai or unki chhavi ek fishan iken kii bhi he
 In such a situation, many critical critics remain in the posture about their acting side and dismiss it as their duty
 lekin yah tay karnaa padegaa ki film main darshak sonam kapur kii shakhsiyat ko dekhne jate hai yaa sonam kapur actress ko
 That baggage needs to be left behind

 Movie Review: Bipasha Basu's Creator 3dpakistani actor Fawad Khan has done a fantastic job
 ladakiyon ko vah 'yammi', 'dashing' or 'kute' lagenge
 According to the demand of the story in the performance of the first half, there is a reserveness in his character
 unka kirdaar second half main khulata he, par thodi jhijak ke saath
 The special thing about Fawad is that he smiles
 ek muskuraana hota he, ek hota he daant faadna, ek daant dikhaate hue hansanaa or ek hota he ankhon se muskuraana
 Smiling with eyes is considered the best in aesthetics

 But the most likely role of comedy has come in the part of Kiran Kher

 The conflict between the parties involved in the Grand Alliance regarding the presidential election is now seen on the surface
 pehle jahaan yah tanatani janata dal you or argedy ke bich chal rahi thi to vahiin janata dal you ne ab congress ko nishane par liya he
 The main reason behind this is senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad's remarks on Bihar Chief Minister and National President of Janata Dal U, Nitish Kumar
 jad (you) ke nishane par he congressjanta dal you ke netaa ab congress par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 It is worth noting that Ghulam Nabi Azad not only raised his finger on the ideology of Nitish Kumar, but also wanted to throw the blame for the defeat of Bihar's daughter and Congress candidate Meira Kumar on Nitish Kumar
 is par janata dal you ke mahasachiv shyaam rajak ne kaha ki ve upie kaa hissaa nahin he or unka gathbandhan sirf bihar main he
 The President is elected at the national level
 shyaam rajak ne kaha ki unki party ne soch samaj kar hi ramnath kovind kaa samarthan kiya he
 Attacking Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, Shyam Razak said that he should look into his philosophy and what were the principles of Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi
 ve yadi unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karenge to unke sawaalon kaa jawaab swatah mil jaayegaa
 He reminds us of the era when Pranab da was supported even while in the NDA
 ve ummidavaaron ke aadhaar par raashtrapati chayan kii baat kehete hai
 The leaders in Chennai had also made several suggestions and those suggestions were not discussed
 ram nath kovind ke bare main ve kehete hai ki bihar ke sandarbh unase acha koi naam nahin laga
 They are supporting Ram Nath Kovind in the interest of Dalits and the state
 ve bahut hi sahi nirnay kii baat kehete hai or kisi bhi tarah ke matbhed se inkaar karte hai
 Shyam Rajak said that the Congress should split the defeat
 unhonebihar kii betimira kumaar ke taur par ek dalit mahila ko apamaanit karne ke liye khada kiya he
 They should have made the decision first
 unke paas vot hi nahin he
 Nor are they fielding anyone
 aisen main ve apamaanit kiye jane kaa zikr karte hai
 He cites earlier that there have been many occasions in the past when the daughter of Dalit and Bihar should have been raised
 us dauraan to bihar kii beti ko yaad nahin kiya gaya
 Other people were remembered at that time
 bijepi ke saath phir se samarthan ke mudde par shyaam rajak ne do took kaha ki ve to bijepi ke saath 17 saal se saath rahe hai
 They parted ways over policy differences
 ve aaj bhi kisaanon ke sawaal par bijepi ke khilaaf rahane kii baat kehete hai
 They say that bjp's economic policy is also against them
 aaj congress ko kisaanon ke sawaal par aarthik niti ke sawaal par andolan khadaa karne ke liye mahagathbandhan bananaa chahie tha
 Those questions disappeared
 ve raashtrapati chunaav ko haari hui baaji qaraar dete hai
 They say that giving priority to this election is a sign of Congress bankruptcy

 Apart from this, jealousy is also related to fourth and seventh house

 Mercury disturbances lead to bad thoughts with jealousy and in this jealousy the person harms another
 shani is irshyaa ko tikaaye rakhata he or brihaspati irshyaa ko nasht kar detaa he
 What are the consequences of jealousy? - The moon is bad and bad - Mental problems are disturbing - Mercury is even more weak - This makes a person fall prey to confusion - People who are jealous are inebriated
 - There are some health problems and what measures should be taken if jealousy is there? kendriya grahamantri or bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah (amit Shah) ne giriraaj singh (giriraj Singh) ko nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ko lekar die gaye unke bayaan par fatkaar lagaai he

 mangalvaar shaam bihar ke siem nitish kumaar ne giriraaj singh ke is twit par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki giriraaj singh aise twit sirf surkhiyon main bane rahane ke liye karte hai
 Significantly, Giriraj Singh (giriraj Singh) posted a tweet on his official Twitter account with some pictures, including Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, BJP leader Sushil Modi, Jitan Ram Manjhi, Ram Vilas Paswan and his son Chirag Paswan at the Iftar party

 Let me tell you that in this Lok Sabha election in Bihar, JDU and BJP contested 17-17 seats out of 40 while the allied Lok Janshakti Party had fielded its candidates in 6 seats
 bijepi or algepi ke sabhi ummidavaaron ne jeet darj kii jabaki JDU 16 siton par jeet darj karne main kaamyaab rahi

 He told NDTV that Giriraj Sir (giriraj Singh) keeps tweeting like this
 mujhe lagata he ki media giriraaj singh (giriraj Singh) ke twit ko kuch zyada hi gambhirtha se le rahi he
 On giving a clean chit to Giriraj Singh in this controversy, Chirag Paswan said that many of his statements have come in continuity
 kabhi bhi tushtikaran kii raajnneeti nahin honi chahie kabhi bhi dharm yaa jati kii raajnneeti nahin karnaa chahie
 The PM himself had advised to avoid such rhetoric

 We are following the same thing

 Its author Mohankrishna Bohra has taken a review of Taslima's books by covering it in full detail
 is kram main aatmakatha-pustakon se tasalima kaa jivan khulata he or upanyaas, kavita, kahani or anya vichaarparak pustakon se unki saahitiyik-vaicharik abhivyaktiyaan
 In this way, this book of six and a half hundred pages presents a complete blueprint of Taslima's personality through a lot of details and analysis as needed
 lekhak ne isamen ek vidrohi, bebaak or vyakti kii purna swatantraaa kii kaayal shakhsiyat kii chetana ke byoron ko usee kii taarkik paridhi main dekhne kii koshish kii he
 Bohra cites the themes of Taslima's autobiography from a young age, underscoring her sense of anti-injustice
 ek kam umr kii ladki kuch na kar paane lekin anyaayi ko sajaa dene kii phantasy rachati he, jisamen patni ko jalaane vaale ek padosi ko vah khud aag main jhulasaayegi
 Taslima's resistant nature is unable to keep pace with society's habits
 ve maa, pita, bhai, bahan or khud ke antartam ke jhuuthon kii cheerfaad karti hai or bohara unki is cheerfaad kii cheerfaad karte hai
 On the day of Eid, he says of the taslima, which rejected the custom of saluting the elders by touching their feet - "was it not his ego emerging in retaliation for his selflessness in the outside world, which was used to insult the elders at home?" Was able to? ”bohra notes that there have been many ups and downs in the sense of feeling towards the mother
 aakhir vah kya antarvastu thi jisane jivan bhar satai jaati rahi maa ke prati tasalima ko katu bana diya tha? vah katutaa jisaki shuruyaat khud ke balaatkaari ko maa ke bistar par dekh lene se hui thi
 According to Bohra, Taslima saw the incident as a betrayal of the mother towards the father, and the 'seeing' which he later corrected as a 'hypocritical vision' of himself under external influences
 lekin ek aisa pati, jo patni ko upekshit karke anyatra sambandh rakhe or ant main uski mrityu kii pratiksha karata ho, uske prati patni kii anyatra hambistari ko tasalima jaisi taarkik stri kaa vishwasghaat maananaa gale nahin utarataa
 It is also interesting that the betrayal which was rejected by Taslima himself in later days, has been quickly supported by the book writer here as 'truth'
 isse aisa lagata he ki saamaajik naitikta or vyaktigat swatantraaa ke muddon par donon jan main matantar kii sthiti he, jo anyatra bhi dikhaai detii he
 For example, in the story book, quoting the heroine of the letter of two women, Taslima supported the affair of a married woman elsewhere
 nayika ke mutabik, ''main shat pratishat sachhee or eemaandaar rahete hue kisi or mard se agar shaareerik sambandh sthapit karun to isse kisi kaa nuksaan nahin hota; na meraa, na humayun kaa
 "bohra calls it a subjective notion of taslima beyond objective justification, because it will" damage the husband's faith in her "
 isi tarah tasalima ke parivaar sanstha ko khaarij karne ke vichaar se bhi bohara nihaayat duniyaadaar dhang se asahmat dikhaai dete hai
 However, he calls Taslima a good writer with good authority over the language, who has the skill to create abstract and play with words

 If you check your baby's blood from 3 days to a month, then many metabolic diseases can be detected, which are possible in the beginning and the newborn can be completely cured

 saath hi parantus bhi bachche kii beemaari ko bahut shushau main jaan lete hai
 a number of tests have also been exhibited at AIIMS, which are completely new in the country, and through this, many disorders of children can be detected
 jaise ki ab ek khaas tarah ke paper se bani kit main navjaat ke khun ko jaanch ke liye liya ja saktaa he or is namoonay se 40 tarah ke disorder kaa pataa kiya ja saktaa he
 Statistics also show that in a metropolis like Delhi, one or two children are born every day who are struggling with some metabolic disorder
 chintaa kii baat yahi he ki abhi tak parents shishu screening test ke bare main jaagruk nahin hai
 They do not know for a long time what disorder their child is suffering from and what is his treatment
 doctoron kii yahi salaah he ki janm ke turant baad shishu kaa blad screening test jarur karavaaen
 Especially those infants whose families have a history of genitic disease

 There was a time when the Congress used to have fun because of the supreme leader in Delhi and the charismatic and popular leaders in the states
 donon ek-duusare ke poorak hua karte the
 The satraps of the states kept their forts so that the national leader could carry forward his nationwide script
 lekin ab congress alaakaman—yani sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi—desh se tabhi samvaad karte hai jab chunaav hota he
 States are either devoid of satraps or referred to defunct puppet leaders

 a leader of Andhra Pradesh and a minister in the central government says, "they have to do it, just talking in vain will not do anything
" ”rahul ke iraadon ko parajeet karne main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke yogadan ko jod len to congress kaa durbhaagya kai guna bad jaataa he
 Manmohan's second term in South Block is a journey of continued collapse and disintegration
 unki chamakdaar kalai to pehle hi utar gai thi
 Whenever a scandal of his government was exposed, the Prime Minister would act as if he was not part of this government
 jab bhi desh koi jawaab maangata, ve formulon or fantasiyon kaa sahaara le lete
 When the streets started getting angry and the country needed leadership, they would shrink in such a shell that no one would tell them the leader
 sabase badhkar, jab bazaar aarthik giravat se karaah rahaa tha, ve asahaay hokar duusari ore dekhte rahe
 The acclaimed hero of liberalization became the sentry of economic collapse
 jab desh netritv kii maang kar rahaa he to manmohan bemaani ho gaye hai
 Therefore, Rahul's problem is not Modi but Manmohan and there is no solution

 The hat-trick government of Chauhan and Raman Singh offers a unique example of overcoming the conflicting trends

 Says a senior Akali Dal MP, "for all those who want to distance themselves from traditional parties, they (AAP) have come up with a different offer
" ”zyaadaatar jaankaron ko ab bhi yah bharosa nahin he ki dilli main hasil safalataa ko aap rashtriya str par doharaa paaegi, lekin is tathy se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki aap kaa kaam karne kaa jo tarika he or usne jis tarah se bijepi, congress, bispi jaisi paramparaagat dalon ke vot hathiyaae hai, usase in sthapit dalon kaa khel bigadgaye kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya he
 a Rajya Sabha MP from BSP admits, "it is a bell of danger"
 ”aisa nahin he ki khatra akelaa bispi par mandara rahaa he
 Looking at the performance of AAP in Delhi elections, where it has blocked bjp's path towards power, many now feel that AAP can be a better 'secular alternative' of Congress
 philhal, congress kii rashtriya str par kamajori or rajyon main hichkole kha rahi ikaiyaan bijepi ke liye vardaan sabit hoti lag rahi hai
 The BJP also has the advantage of having a trusted commander like Modi at the center and skilled warriors in the states

 In the important states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, they do not have the facility to attack anti-semitism

 Therefore, the challenge for Narendra Modi in the summer political war is tough
 desh saans roke us kareeb aate daur kii pratiksha main he
 If this phase is to be done by Modi, he will not have to work with a wave to wash away the remnants of the oldest party in the country, but he will have to ride ahead of the wave in the summer of 2014 and ride the storm

 sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ne soharabuddin maamle kii sibiai jaanch par badi tippanee kii he
 The court said that the alleged fake encounter of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, his wife Kausar Bi and his aide Tulsiram Prajapati was investigated for trapping the leaders under a well thought out strategy

 J

 The court acquitted the accused for lack of evidence and expressed sorrow over 3 deaths
 faisle kii prati shuukravaar ko nahin mil pai lekin media ko faisle ke ansh muhaiyaa karaae gaye
 In his order, Judge Sharma said that his predecessor (judge MB Goswami) had issued a charge-free order on the application of accused number 16 (BJP president Amit Shah), saying that the investigation was politically motivated
 faisle main kaha gaya he, ‘mere samaksh pesh kiye gaye tamaam sabooton or gavaahon ke bayanon par kareeb se vichaar karte hue mujhe yah kehane main koi hichak nahin he ki sibiai jaisi ek sheersh jaanch agency ke paas ek purv nirdhaarit siddhant or patakatha thi, jiskaa makasad raajnneetik netaaon ko fansaana tha
 The CBI was based on the script, the order said that the CBI, during its investigation of the case, worked on something else instead of bringing out the truth
 faisle main kaha gaya he ki yah saaf taur par jaahir hota he ki sibiai sachai kaa pataa lagane ke bajaay pehle se soche samajhe gaye ek khaas or purv nirdhaarit siddhant ko sthapit karne ke liye kahin adhik vyakul thi
 It said that the CBI worked to reach its 'target' rather than conducting an investigation as per law
 faisle main kaha gaya he ki is tarah puri jaanch kaa lakshya us mukaam ko hasil karne ke liye ek patakatha par kaam karnaa tha
 Also, in the process of trapping political leaders, CBI fabricated evidence and put statements of witnesses in the chargesheet
 sibiai ne laaparvaahee baratiadalat ne is baat kaa zikr kiya ki mahatvapurn sakshya ke prati sibiai ne laaparvaahee barti, jo yah spasht sanket detaa he ki jaanch agency ne aanan - fanan main jaanch puri kii
 The verdict states, '
 
 
 is tarah sibiai ne un pulicekarmiyon ko fansaaya jinhen kisi sajeesh ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 
 
 The court also mentioned that he was saddened to have killed three people and could not be punished for it
 saath hi, uske paas aropiyon ko doshi nahin qaraar dene ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin he
 The verdict states that there is no evidence to prove the cbi's theory that a police team had abducted the three people (the deceased)
 aadesh main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki sibiai yah sabit karne main bhi naakaam rahi ki kathith ghatana ke vakt maukey par aaropee pulicekarmi maujuud the
 The encounter took place in 2005 when the trio (deceased) were returning from Hyderabad to Sangli in Maharashtra in a bus which was allegedly detained by a police team on the intervening night of 22-23 November 2005 and the couple were found in a vehicle Was taken while Prajapati was taken to another vehicle
 sibiai ke mutabik 26 november 2005 ko soharabuddin shaikh ko kathith taur par gujarat or rajasthan police kii ek sanyukt team ne maar giraaya or teen din baad kausar bi maari gai
 Prajapati was killed in an encounter on 27 December 2006 on the gujarat-rajasthan border

 The way the Madhya Pradesh Housing Board has allotted houses to many leaders in posh areas of Bhopal, at least this is evident

 a division bench of Justices Sushil Harkauli and Justice Alok Aradhe issued notice on the pleas of former Madhya Pradesh Director General of Police (DGP) Arun Guertu and former Kerala DGP Upendra Verma asking the leaders why they should not be made parties in the case
 adaalat ne mahajan or dikshit ke alaava reva se saansad devraj singh, bhind se bhaajapa vidhayak arvind singh, narsinghpur ke congress vidhayak sunil jaiswal or vidisha ke purv bhaajapa vidhayak gursharan singh ko bhi isi tarah kaa notice jari kiya he
 'after the rigging is exposed, i will now scrutinize the papers of Riviera Town
 yahaan shivaraj singh chouhan or sushamaa swaraj ko makaan mili hai'
 Arun Gurtu, petitioner and former Director General of Police, Madhya Pradesh, petitioners had challenged the arrangement of 20 percent reservation to mps and mlas in the housing board flat allocation
 darasal 29 july, 1994 ko tatkaaleen digvijay singh sarkaar ne pradesh ke vidhayakon ke liye houseing board kii yojanaon main 20 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa nirnay liya

 Moreover, such leaders also acquired houses which already had houses or land in the area

 He found that former BJP MLA Gurusharan Singh of Vidisha has two triplexes in the premium segment, while there was a huge panic for these houses
 isi colony main dikshit ko lotus vila kaa chah number kaa triplex aavantit ho gaya or uski registry bhi ho gai

 lekin puraane police afasar gurtu ko yah baat khaasi nagavar gujri ki netaa makaan paa jaaen or afasar haath malate rah jaaen
 At the same time, he met Verma, former DGP of Kerala and in the conversation he came to know that despite all efforts at the Kalindev Mahadev Tulsi tower in the posh area near the board office, Varma did not find a house, while BJP MP from Indore Sumitra Mahajan was found at Kilandev
 Two houses of a category were allotted

 After this disclosure, Mahajan said, "I do not have any house in Bhopal
 agar is makaan ke aavanton main koi aniyamitata he to main apana naam waapas lene ko taiyaar hum
 However, after seeing this official kindness on the leaders, Gurtu and Verma decided to take the matter to court and in October 2010 filed a PIL in the Jabalpur High Court
 unhone saansadon-vidhayakon ke cote ko gaiyr-kanoonee bataate hue ise khatm karne kii maang kii
 The end of the forgery of the leaders came to grips for the first time when the petitioner's lawyer Siddharth Radhelal Gupta filed an RTI document of two houses of some mlas and mps in September 2011 and the information given in the Election Commission in which it It was clearly written that where these leaders have private houses
 7 november, 2011 ko adaalat ne board ko aakhri mauka diya or kaha ki yadi ab unhone pandrah dinon main jawaab nahin diya to vah apana faisla de degi
 In the last week of November, the board filed its reply
 agali sunwaayee main gupta ne adaalat ko bataaya ki saansad vidhayak cote main teen vidhayakon-teen saansadon ne galat jaankaree di he or cote kaa durupyog kiya he
 He said that mlas and mps have taken home by giving false affidavits, hence such quota should be removed
 iske baad 9 april ko hycourt ne 6 netaaon ko pakshakaar banane ke sambandh main notice jari kar diya
 After all, on how the ineligible leaders got these houses, Housing Board Commissioner Arun Bhatt pleaded innocently, "I have been in this position for three months, but the Board has conveyed to the Honorable Court that the MP Rules related to legislative quota remain in the brochure of their society and mp-mlas knew the rules
 iske liye ve hi jimmedaar hai
 On the question of allocation to MP from outside Madhya Pradesh, Bhatt said that he is investigating the old case and will take action as per the rule
 unhone laachaari jataai, ''ghar-ghar jaakar dastavejon ko check nahin kiya ja saktaa he or shikaayat milane par hi jaanch kii ja sakati he
 Court order will be considered in the case
 ''vahiin, mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan maamle ke hycourt main hone kaa hawala dekar jawaab ko taal gaye

 Yogendra Yadav has made a serious allegation that the Kejriwal government was a conspirator, that the Delhi Election Office had written a letter to the Delhi government on 4 March 2015 to make the rules
 lekin, ab tak dilli sarkaar ne jaan boojhkar koi niyam isliye nahin banaaya taaki swaraj india or uske jaisi or partiyaan emsidi chunaav kaaman simbel par na lard saken
 Let us tell you that the Delhi High Court has rejected the petition seeking the common symbol of Swaraj India
 2013 main supreme court ne apane ek aadesh main kaha tha ki agar koi party 10 fisadi siton par chunaav ladati he to use kaaman simbel par chunaav ladane ke liye diya ja saktaa he
 Based on this order, the common symbol of the broom was given to the common man party in the assembly elections
 yogendra yadavaka kahana he ki nigam chunaavon main swaraj india ko samaan chunaav chinh se vanchit karne kaa aam aadmi party shadyantra kar rahi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party contested the election by taking advantage of the rule itself, after forming the government, a conspiracy has been hatched to remove Swaraj India from the same rule
 aapako yah bhi bataa den ki dilli ke purv chunaav ayukta ke samaan chunaav chinh ke prastaav ko aam aadmi party sarkaar ne pichley do saal se lataka rakhaa he

 During the recent Jat agitation, Munak canal was badly affected due to which there was a shortage of water in Delhi for several days

 Punjab does not have enough water to be given to others
 esavaiel nahar kaa koi auchity hi nahin he
 His statement was strongly opposed by the leaders of Haryana
 kejariwal ke khilaaf prastaavkejariwal ke bayaan se khafa hokar haryana vidhansabha main unke khilaaf sarvasammati se ninda prastaav paas kiya gaya
 While Minister Anil Vij said that if we do not provide water for Delhi, what will Kejriwal do? Kejriwal says Punjab has no water to spare for # sylto Haryana
 If we say we also have no water to spare for Delhi what will # Kejriwaldo?— ANIL VIJ Minister (@anilvijmantri)march 16, 2016 Amid criticism from non-congress ruled states over the establishment of an institute for counter terrorism, Union Home Minister P

 unka kahana he ki yah samvidhan ke sangheey praavdhaanon kii avagya karata he or rajyon ke adhikaron ko chhinane kaa prayaas he
 However, Chidambaram in his brief address neither mentioned the controversy over NCTC nor did he react to the Chief Ministers' objection to it
 chidambaram ne kaha ki centre sarkaar rajyon main sattarudh raajnneetik dalon ke aadhaar par unase bhedbhaav nahin karti
 He said that the Center worked with the erstwhile government in West Bengal and we are happy to work with the new government
 unhone kaha ki jangalmahal main naksaliyon dwaara bane halaat par nayi sarkaar ne lagaataar niyantran bana rakhaa he or rajya kii kul milakar paristhiti main sudhaar hua he

 "he said," Our attitude towards terrorism, Naxalism and extremism is the same and in this we do not see whose government is in the state
 ’ chidambaram ke mutabik centre sarkaar chaahati he ki enesji kaa kolkata hub laghu kshetreey centre banakar desh ke purvottar rajyon ke liye bhi kaam kare
 He said, "when all facilities are fully ready, the facilities in Kolkata will be twice the facilities in Mumbai or Chennai
 ’ samaaroh main trinmul congress ke mahasachiv or jahajrani rajya mantri mukul roy bhi maujuud the
 Describing internal security as a complex issue, Chidambaram said, "I can assure my colleagues Mukul Roy and others that we will completely remove the Naxalite problem and get Bengal out of this crisis
" ’ chidambaram ne kaha, ‘rajya or centre kii agenciyaan milakar kaam karte hue pashchim bengal ke halaat main kaaphi sudhaar laai hai

 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko maat dene ke liye mahagathbandhan banane kii koshish ko karaara jhatka laga he
 It was shattered even before the Grand Alliance was formed
 jahaan ek ore dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne mahagathbandhan se alag chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya, to duusari ore rajyasabha ke upasabhapati chunaav main vipakshi dalon kaa bikharaav saaf dekhne ko mila
 Many opposition parties are not in the mood to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections by joining the Grand Alliance
 aam aadmi party ke alaava ediemke, tiares or bijedy jaise dal bhi congress ke saath aate nahin dikh rahe hai
 The AIADMK, TRS and BJD have also proved this by voting in favor of nda's Harivansh Narayan Singh in the Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman election
 itnaa hi nahin, aam aadmi party, wiesar congress, pidipi ne rajyasabha upasabhapati chunaav kii voting se khud ko alag rakhaa
 Walking out of the house of these parties is a clear indication that they are not with the Congress even when they are in opposition
 maaloom ho ki saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main piem modi ko haraane ke liye sabhi vipakshi dalon ko ekajute karne kii koshish pichley kuch samay se chal rahi he
 After the Karnataka elections, all the opposition parties came on one stage at the swearing-in ceremony of Chief Minister Kumaraswamy
 yah pehali baar tha, jab modi sarkaar ke khilaaf sabhi vipakshi dal ekajute najar aae the
 Aam Aadmi Party convenor Kejriwal also attended the swearing-in ceremony of Kumaraswamy
 iske baad jab argedy netaa or bihar ke purv up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne dilli ke jantar mantar main mujffarpur balika grih cond ke khilaaf dharna pradarshan kiya, tab bhi zyaadaatar vipakshi partiyaan ek saath najar aae
 It included all opposition leaders including Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Kejriwal, Sitaram Yechury
 haalanki rahul gandhi or kejariwal ne ek saath manch saajha nahin kiya tha
 Since these events, it was believed that in the coming elections, all political parties will jointly present a tough challenge to PM Modi and BJP, but now it is shattered before the formation of a grand alliance
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejarivalane elaan kar diya he ki ve saal 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav main kisi bhi tareeke ke gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin honge
 On Thursday, Kejriwal said in Jind district of Haryana that the Aam Aadmi Party will contest all the seats in the Lok Sabha elections along with the assembly elections in Haryana
 pradhanmantri narendra modi do divasiy china daure par vuhaan shahar pahunch gaye hai
 He will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday
 piem modi ke is daure kii khaas baat ye he ki wo vahaan kisi aupchaarik daure par nahin gaye hai
 If Modi and Jinping meet, there will be long talks between the two countries on many issues, but the purpose of this conversation is that the two leaders can be aware of each other's perspective
 piem modi or jinping kii is mulaakaat ko pichley saal ke doklam vivaad ke baad ise donon deshon ke rishton main vishwasabahali kaa ek abhootpurv kadam mana ja rahaa he
 Through personal chemistry, the two leaders will emphasize on strengthening mutual relations

 Modi and Jinping will talk to each other 5 to 6 times in 2 days in Wuhan city
 is mulaakaat ke liye jahaan china ne modi ke liye red carpet bichaaya he to bharat ne bhi pichley kuch hafton main china kii har samvedansheeltaa kaa khyaal rakhaa he
 Nearly 30 years later, india-china history will repeat itself
 In 1988, when the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited China and met with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, the ice of india-china relations melted
 2018 bharat or china ko wo mauka dobaaraa de rahaa he
 The idea of meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping came up during the BRICS Summit last year in Wuhan
 doklam kii tanatani ke fouran baad modi or jinping china ke shyamin shahar main ek duusare se mili the
 Modi and Xi Jinping have a good meeting modi-jinping is meeting ahead of the SCO summit in June

 Before the modi-jinping meeting in Wuhan, India has made great efforts to normalize relations
 modi or shi jinping kii mulaakaat ko tibetiyon ke dharmaguru dalai lamas ne bhi ek acha kadam bataaya he
 The meeting between Modi and Jinping is important for international diplomacy, bilateral and regional relations
 haalanki china or bharat ke bich vyapaar asantulan he
 India will try to overcome it

 doklam vivaad ke baad 2017 main china ne hidrological data nahin saajha kiya tha
 China has also agreed to resume the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra from the Nathula route this year
 sushamaa ke alaava raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne bhi isi hafte shanghai sahyog sanghathan main rakshaamantriyon ke sammelan bhi hissaa liya tha
 Sitharaman also met with China's Defense Minister Wei Feng separately

 mahato parivaar ko laga jhatkadilli ke IGI airport par jab gita komahato parivaarake saamne laayaa gaya to usne kisi ko bhi pahchaanane se inkaar kar diya
 It was earlier reported that when Geeta was sent a photograph of the Mahato family while living in Pakistan, she identified him as his parent
 haalankidiene reportane ke baad hi isse pardaa uthegaa
 People from many parts of the country claimed Geeta as their daughter
 desh ke saikadon jagahon par shantipurna tareeke se pradarshan hue, log jamaa hue or aae or chale gaye
 No one took those performances seriously
 varna unase baat karne kaa koi tarika nikaala ja saktaa tha
 Even now there will be more peaceful demonstrations than violent ones
 haryana ke mevaat main pradarshnakariyon kii sankhya bahut zyada thi magar vahaan koi hinsa nahin hui
 a large rally was also held in Purnia in Bihar, but there was no violence there
 mumbai ke mumbara main kitne hi log aakar chale gaye
 a large number of people gathered in Trichy in Kerala, but there was no violence
 nagpur main bhi kaaphi bada march hua
 If we count where there was a big rally and there was no violence, then their number would be more
 lekin jab hinsa hoti he to logon or police kii bhoomika ko lekar kai sawaal ubharate hai, kai tarah ke video aa jate hai
 Media excludes both
 uskaa jor sirf hinsa kii tasveeron main hota he lekin kaarnon kii khoj main dilchaspee nahin hoti
 Only the statements of the police dominate
 channelon ke samay kaa bada hissaa dibet main chalaa jaataa he
 People keep searching for answers by piling videos in whatsapp
 jaise jo log maare gaye hai unke parivaar kii kahani aapako kahin nahin dikhegi
 When violence occurs, people's favor becomes weak
 iskaa bhi ek system bana hua he
 That is why Gandhiji withdrew the non-cooperation movement after the violence of Chauri Chaura
 jab pradarshan niyantran se baahar hone lage to roak dena chahie
 Violence has many causes, yet its worst effect is on the outcome of the demonstration
 jo log dhyaan se sun rahe hote hai wo bhi hinsa ke bahaane sunanaa band kar dete hai
 Violence has increased in many demonstrations
 ek trend dikh rahaa he
 Where more and more people are coming, there is no violence
 jahaan tulanaatmak rup se kam log hai vahaan hinsa kam ho rahi he
 The video that goes viral after the violence should not reach any conclusion immediately
 uttejit nahin hona chahie
 But it is also not right to dismiss or put aside these videos which is happening
 is baar kii reporting main police kii bhoomika vaale video gaayab ho gaye hai
 There is no point to them properly and concretely
 baharich kaa ek video he jisamen aap dekh sakate hai ki police kis tarah se pradarshnakariyon ko daboch kar maar rahi he
 His motive seems to be something more than control over fear
 log jawaab main kuch nahin kar rahe hai
 Are just retreating but the police do not look calm
 lathi se maare ja rahi he
 After seeing this picture, you will come to a conclusion immediately but do not know what happened just before that
 phir bhi yah tasviir vichlit karti he
 In a video of Gorakhpur you can see that stones are running from both sides
 police pathar chalaati dikh rahi he
 The entire street is filled with brick pieces
 agar aap duusari said se video banaaen to sirf police eent chalaati dikhegi lekin is video main aap dekh rahe hai ki duusari taraf se bhi log pathar chalaa rahe hai
 a kind of front is open
 bahut saare video main log pathar chalaate dikh rahe hai
 Many times stones are run from the protesters
 saaf-saaf dikhte hai
 The identity of the stoners has been disputed many times
 silampur or lakhanu main kaha gaya ki wo pradarshan kaa hissaa nahin the
 His identity was something else
 is tarah kaa vivaad ho jaataa he
 Some people are in the grip of the police and somewhere the police is in the grip of the people
 ahmedabad main police ko hi chapet main le liya
 The scene was horrifying but seven boys come out of this crowd and save the policeman
 kuch video main police hinsa ke baad un jagahon par baad main pathar chalaati dikhti he
 There have been many videos of police brutality entering houses, which was not needed
 sadak par pathar chale hai to uske jawaab main police kisi bhi ghar main ghuskar auraton yaa mardon ko pakad kar peet nahin sakati he
 This is not policing
 police pani kii bauchhaaron kaa istamaal kam kar rahi he
 Visuals of straight sticks, and tear gas shells are coming
 tab bhi jab bheed dur ja chuki he
 Do not panic by forwarding videos to each other
 kai baar is chakkar main puraane video bhi farverd hone lagate hai or ek shahar kaa farverd hua video duusare shahar ke naam se farverd hone lagata he
 Thirteen cities of UP have witnessed violence during demonstrations
 abhi pichley hi maheene babari masjid or ramajnmabhumi vivaad par faisla aayaa to suraksha kii kitni taiyaari thi
 Then there was no violence
 phir ab upi main har doosraa pradarshan hinsak kyon ho ja rahaa he? kya sirf log kaaran hai? police bilkul nahin? do dinon main 7 log goli se mar gaye or police kahati he ki usne goli nahin chalaai
 Is it a convincing argument or a fact
 mangaluru main bhi do logon kii maut hui he
 Whatever the arguments of the police, people are walking around with evidence and videos on their behalf
 to logon kii daleel kii taraf se police par sawaal nahin he sirf ye chalata he ki logon ne hinsa kii
 The police also do not tell many times from their side how much violence happened on their behalf
 wo hameshaa sahi lagati he jabaki hoti nahin he
 After the vandalism in Jamia Millia, the police did not say in the first press conference that three people were shot
 kai tarah kii theory police kii taraf se hi di gai
 Police said that there is no bullet
 phir kaha ki desi katta chalaa he or kisi bahari ne chalaaya
 Then the video came that the police had a pistol in his hand
 wo goli chalaa rahi he
 The Medico Legal Report states that Shoaib and Ejaz received bullet injury due to police firing
 ab is par charchaa hi nahin he
 What violence was taking place in Jamia's library where the girls were killed
 saare sawaal gaayab hai
 Going through several types of videos, there was also fierce communalism in the thinking of the police
 kai video main afasar or sipaahi gaaliyaan dete sunai dete hai
 Talking to his officers with the abuses and also to the people
 gaaliyon ke alaava sampradayik bhashaa kaa bhi prayog aam he
 But the media does not value it
 police main ek or cheharaa he jo police kaa cheharaa nahin he lekin he police main hi
 In Bangulru, the police took the protesters who took them to a marriage hall
 unhen tamote rice sambar rasm or dahi chaaval bhi khilaayaa

 After the Jamia Lathi Charch in Delhi, at Janthamantar, the girls gave flowers to the policeman and sang songs that Delhi Police should talk to us, come with us
 ham tumse baat karenge na ki ghunsa laat karenge
 At some places, the protest is violent due to the protestors, while the police also get violent
 ravivaar ko ramlila maidan main pradhanmantri kii sabha he
 Will Delhi Police impose Section 144? Obviously it won't
 to is tarah se dhara 144 bhi sarkari hinsa kaa rup ban jaati he

 You can see that a large number of people gathered outside Jama Masjid
