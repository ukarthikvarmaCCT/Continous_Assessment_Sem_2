 The results of previous elections prompted Chavan to tie up with Rankapa for the Mumbai Municipal Corporation elections
 pichhali baar donon ne biemasi chunaav alag alag ladaa tha, chavaan ke anusaar yadi donon mil jaaen to 132 siten paa sakate hai
 Chavan had said, 'it will not be difficult to get a majority of 114 seats in the 227-member BMC
 ’ ab shivasena-bhaajapa 100 ke aankade ko paar karti najar aa rahi he
 This suggests that Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray might think of reaching the magic figure of 114 alone instead of appealing for support from his cousin Raj
 thane main bhi shivasena-bhaajapa gathbandhan congress-rakanpa se aage he
 Shiv Sena has won 51 seats and BJP seven, Congress 18 so far and NCP 34 seats
 manase ko nau, basapa ko do or nirdaleey ummidavaaron ko aath siton par jeet hasil hui he
 The ruling BJP has so far won 14 seats in Nagpur
 congress ne saat siten jeetin hai, jabaki rakanpa, shivasena, basapa or manase ko ek ek seat mili he
 Independent candidates have won two seats
 nasik main manase ne chah siton par jeet hasil kii he, jabaki congress, rakanpa or bhaajapa dopaher tak paanch paanch siton par badhat banaae hue the
 On the result, the BJP won two seats
 pune ke nattejey rakanpa ke liye achche nahin rahe
 The results of the 152-member municipal corporation in Pune led Mayor Mohan Singh Rajpal to face defeat from his BJP rival Ganesh Bidkar
 pune main ab tak manase ne paanch, rakanpa ne saat, congress ne teen, bhaajapa ne do siton par jeet hasil kii he
 The party's decision to join the Shiv sena-bjp alliance of Ramdas Athawale of the Republican Party of India did not benefit the party much as it has so far won just one seat in the 130-member municipal corporation of Thane
 mumbai kii 227 sadasyeey biemasi ke alaava shivasena-rakanpa thane (130), ulhasanagar (78), nasik (122) or nagpur (145) par sattarudh he jabaki congress-rakanpa gathbandhan pune (152) or sholapur (102) par kabiz he
 NCP Pimpri
 
 Chinchwad is ruling the municipal corporation, while Congress is ruling Amravati (87)

 i wish he was in my team in 2003, but i am happy today that my guess turned out to be correct
 ganguli ne hi dhoni ke tallent ko pahachaanate hue unhen vanade main number teen par batting ke liye promot kiya tha
 After this, Dhoni never looked back

 a political Mahabharata has erupted in the BJP and Aam Aadmi Party on the degree of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 somvaar ko bijepi ne jahaan narendra modi kii bie or eme kii degree saarvajanik kii, vahiin aam aadmi party ne ek baar phir marksheet or degree ko farji qaraar diya he
 The AAP team will go to Delhi University on Tuesday for the degree test
 aam aadmi party ne pradhanmantri kii bie or eme kii degree main alag-alag naamon ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai
 It has been informed by the party that on Tuesday at 3 pm, a team of Aam Aadmi Party will examine the University of Delhi and get the BA degree of PM
 pehle yah team 11 baje jane vaali thi lekin baad main kaarykram main badlaav kiya gaya
 The party has also urged BJP President Amit Shah and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to follow along
 bijepi ne kejariwal ko bheji degree kii copyis bich bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv shrikant sharma ne dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko piem kii degree maamle main chitthee likhi he
 Along with the letter, copies of the Prime Minister's BA and MA degrees have been sent to the CM
 sharma ne chitthee main likhaa he kimarxshit or digreeki copy dekhne ke baad shaayad aapaki bhrantiyaan dur hogi
 DU has Maintenance in Record: On the other hand, according to DU official sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's degree is maintained in University records
 narendra modi ne saal 1978 main bie paas kiya or ek saal baad 1979 main degree di gai
 His name is written in the record as Narendra Damodar Das Modi and the degree was given with the same name
 ye vahi record he, jisamen har chaatr ke paas-fail hone kii jaankaree hoti he
 The roll number and name on which Modi passed his BA in year 78, the same roll number and name is inscribed on the marksheet and degree
 DU ne kejariwal ke aaropon ko kiya khaarijis bich dilli uniwarsity ke visi ne kaha he ki unhone kisi bhi record ko sil karne kaa aadesh nahin diya he
 VC Yogesh Tyagi said that he has not given any such order
 unka yah jawaab mukhyamantri kejariwal ke us twit par aayaa he, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki dilli uniwarsity main dastavejon ko sil kar diya gaya he aurabijepi ne media ke samnellerji dastavej pesh kiye hai
 The AAP leader questioned why the original documents related to Modi's BA degree have been sealed? He urged DU to implement the order of the Central Information Commission
 diu ke visi ne isapar kaha, 'hamen siaisi kaa aadesh mila he or ham apane record jaanchane ke baad isapar jawaab denge
 Tyagi further said that as far as the sealing of the documents is concerned, he did not give any such order
 uniwarsity main artiai se sambandhit vibhaag ne agar aisa aadesh diya he to unhen isaki jaankaree nahin di gai he
 Narendra Modi's roll number is different in the year 1977 and different in 1978 in different degree and name confusions degree
 diu ke mutabik, teenon saal role number ek hi hota he, lekin supplementry hone par role number badal jaataa he
 It is important that the student's registration number should be one
 1977 main bie kii marksheet par narendra kumaar damodaradaas modi likhaa hua
 Whereas only Narendra Damodar Das Modi in 1978
 ho sakati he typographical mistekdiu pariksha visheshgyon ke mutabik, pariksha main form bharte samay chaatr jis naam se form bharte hai, marksheet usee naam se aati he
 Often many students make a mistake in the name or volume of it
 kai baar marksheet main bhi typographical galtiyaan hoti hai, jise chaatr ko thik karana hota he
 It is likely that for the first time Narendra Kumar Damodar Das Modi has been filled and second time Narendra Damodar Das Modi
 jaankaar bataate hai ki agar chaatr karection nahin karavaate hai to aage chalakar agar kisi duusare vishay yaa santhaan main daakhila lenaa he, tab alag-alag naamon kii vajah se mushkil aa sakati he
 So the students then go around the university to get the name corrected
 1971 se SOL main teen saal ke grajuation program kii shuruyaat hui thi
 Degree and Marksheet as per rules: VC Secondary, Gujarat University Vice Chancellor Dr
 mahesh patel ne degree ko lekar kisi tarah ke vivaad ko khaarij kiya he
 He said, 'I don't think there is any dispute
 hamen har saal naam main badlaav ko lekar hajaaron aavedan milte hai
 There was a manual arrangement in 1981–1982
 unhone pehle narendra kumaar likhaa hoga or phir narendra damodaradaas modi kar diya hoga
 Therefore, Narendra Damodar Das Modi is written in his degree

 After the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, the first victim was the US Embassy in the capital Tehran
 hazaron lakhon chaatro kii bheed ne america duutavas par chadhaai kar di
 And took hostage American officials and employees working there
 unki ek hi maang thi
 The US immediately sent Mohammad Raza Pahlavi back to Iran so that the country could take account of his actions
 par koun tha mohammad raza pahalavi? america use kyon bachaa rahaa tha
 And why did the people of Iran want to punish him? The Gulf area has become a heap of gunpowder
 khadi main hathiyaaron kaa zakhira ikattha kiya gaya
 For this reason, tensions between Iran and America are increasing
 aakhir america or iran ke bich se tusal kyon hai
 Why the two countries do not like each other with a teary eye
 kyon donon ke bich hameshaa jang jaise halaat rahete hai
 There was an Islamic revolution in Iran
 janvari 1979 aate aate puure iran main halaat grih yuddh jaise ho gaye the
 Citizens and protesters there were demanding the recall of Ayatollah Khomeini, who was facing deportation
 sena un par goliyaan chalaa rahi thi
 At the same time, the first victim of violent mob became the American embassy in the capital Tehran
 hazaron lakhon chaatro kii bheed ne america duutavas par chadhaai kar di or vahaan kaam kar rahe america adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ko bandhak bana liya
 He had only one demand, the US immediately sent Mohammad Raza Pehlavi back to Iran so that this country could take account of his actions

 Especially America, Britain and Soviet Union
 magar 50 ke dashak main america super power ban chukaa tha lihaaza duniya ke har kone main usne dakhal dena shuru kar diya
 In some places it was successful but in Iran it failed
 iran main america kaa honeymoon period ab bas khatm hone vaala tha
 Because in this velvety way of theirs, they were going to stand like a rock, Ayatollah Ruhullah Khomeini

 However, Chandi herself has been denying any such possibility by speculating such news

 petroleum va prakritik gas mantri dharmendra pradhan ne petroleum sabsidi kam karne kii disha main ek anuthi pahal kii he
 They themselves are calling specific individuals, ministers and leaders and requesting them to leave the subsidized cylinder
 dharmendra pradhan har din ek viipi ko phone karke unase sabsidi vaala silendar lenaa band karne kaa anurodh kar rahe hai
 After becoming the petroleum minister, Pradhan himself stopped taking LPG at a cheaper rate
 tab se vah bazaar dar par hi silendar kharid rahe hai
 Dharmendra Pradhan wants that subsidized fuel should be provided only to the needy
 unke aagrah par vitt mantri arun jetali ne sasta gas silendar lenaa band kar diya
 On Saturday, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi did the same
 bijli mantri piyush goyal ne twitor par jari sandesh main kaha ki unhone bhi sabsidi vaala alpiji conection waapas kar diya he
 He said, 'I believe that rich and convenience-rich people who can buy LPG at market price, should voluntarily stop taking gas cylinders at subsidized cheap price
 'kai rajanetaaon or naukarshahon ne sabsidi vaala alpiji silinder kaa upyog band kar diya he
 Currently 14 consumers a year
 2 kilo ke sabsidi vaale 12 gas silendar milte hai
 Consumers can also replace 34-kg cylinders at a cheaper rate in place of larger cylinders
 dilli main sabsidi vaala 14
 The 2 kg cylinder is currently available for Rs 417, while the small 5 kg cylinder is priced at Rs 155
 duusari taraf 14
 Market price 708 for a 2 kg cylinder
 50 rupee or paanch kilo ke silendar kaa 351 rupee he
 In such a situation, leaving the subsidized cylinder cheaper will save the subsidy given to the government
 pichley vitt varsh main sarkaar ne alpiji par 46,458 karod rupee sabsidi di thi
 Pradhan has urged mps, mlas, senior government officials and executives of public sector companies to leave the subsidy once again

 Efforts have also been intensified to transfer subsidies given to LPG consumers directly into their bank accounts
 pradhan ne kaha, 'alpiji kii diarect cash transfar kii yojana 'pahal' ke liye kaaphi behatar pratikriya mili he
 The plan was resumed on 15 November
 ab tak 15
 7 out of 5 crore LPG customers
 63 karod graahakon ko 'pahal' yojana se joda gaya he
 We are linking the scheme with the scheme of directly subsidizing one percent customers to bank accounts
 'gharelu alpiji upabhoktaaon ko 'pahal' yojana se judane par unke bank khaaton main 568 rupee milenge
 On receipt of the amount in the bank account, the customer has to buy the cylinder at the market price

 11 am on Saturday morning to clean the river Yamuna
 30 baje uma bharti dilli sachivalay kii dyodhi langhakar baithak ke liye pahunchi
 So the journalists gathered outside felt that nothing new might come out on the cleanliness of the Yamuna, but the genie of a new controversy would come out
 lekin aadhe ghante kii baithak ke baad jab jalasansaadhan mantri baahar nikaleen to hansate boleen ki arvind kejariwal ke bulaave par ab uma bharti ke saath nitin gadakari, venkaiya naidu bhi baithak karenge taaki yamuna safai ko thos amalijama pahanaaya ja sake or gujarat ke sabarmati nadi kii tarah yahaan bhi kisi ko jhula jhulaayaa ja sake
 He quipped, now the good days of river Yamuna have arrived
 ye kahkar unka kafila aage bad gaya
 How good days have come in the relationship of governments fighting on issues like onions is a puzzle
 lekin iske kuch der baad dilli sarkaar ke kanoon mantri kapil mishra nikle
 He also laughs that in 45 days a blue print of Yamuna cleaning will be ready
 tippaniyan When he was asked how the rivers which could not be cleaned after spending 4000 thousand crores would be clean
 to unka kahana tha ki centre or rajya sarkaar saath kaam karenge or is baar nadi bina paison ke saaf hogi
 Experts say that the cleaning of Yamuna is an important political issue for the central and state government
 isi ke vajah se baat-baat main aaropon kii bauchhaar karne vaali donon partiyaan ab ek pej par dikh rahi he
 The cleanliness of the Yamuna river may not have started yet, but the political misdeeds of these two political parties have definitely started cleaning
 janata ko banaavati vivaadon main uljhaakar vaastivik samasyaon se dur rakhane kii ranneeti har party ke liye kargar rahi he
 But you have to understand that no party can clean the river Yamuna as long as you do not have any concern about cleaning the rivers
 yamuna nadi ko saaf-suthra karne ke liye shanivaar subah 11
 Uma Bharti reached the meeting at Delhi's Secretariat's Deodhi by 30 pm
 to baahar jamaa patrakaron ko laga ki yamuna ke safai par kuch nayaa bhale na nikle lekin ek nae vivaad kaa jinn to nikal hi aayega
 But after the half-hour meeting, when the Minister of Water Resources came out, he laughed that on the call of Arvind Kejriwal, now Nitin Gadkari, Venkaiah Naidu will also meet with Uma Bharti so that Yamuna cleaning can be put on a solid performance and like the Sabarmati river of Gujarat Here, one can swing the swing
 unhone chutki lee, ab yamuna nadi ke achche din aa gaye hai
 Saying this, his convoy moved forward
 pyaaj jaise muddon par ladane vaali sarkaron ke sambandhon main achche din kaise aa gaye ye ek paheli he
 But shortly thereafter, Delhi Government Law Minister Kapil Mishra came out
 unhone bhi hansate kaha ki 45 din main yamuna kii safai kaa blue print taiyaar hoga
 The comments jab unase poocha gaya ki 4000 hazaar karod kharch hone ke baad jo nadeen saaf nahin ho pai wo kaise saaf hogi
 So he said that the central and state governments will work together and this time the river will be clean without money
 jaankaar kehete hai ki yamuna kii safai centre or rajya sarkaar ke liye ahm raajnneetik mudda he
 Because of this, both the parties which are bombarding the allegations in talk - now appear on one page
 yamuna nadi kii saaf-safai abhi bhale nahin shuru ho pai ho lekin in donon raajnneetik partiyon ke raajnneetik duragrahon kii safai jarur shuru ho gai he
 The strategy of keeping the public away from real problems by engaging in artificial disputes has worked for every party
 lekin aapako ye samajhnaa hoga ki yamuna nadeen ko koi party nahin saaf kar sakati he jab tak aapke andar nadiyon kii safai ke prati chintaa nahin hogi

 In the national capital Delhi, the NGT has extended its stay till July 27 in the case of about 16,000 trees to be cut in the name of redemption

 bharat ke itihaas main marathaon kaa bada naam rahaa he
 We have all heard stories from Chhatrapati Shivaji to Peshwa Bajirao, but director Ashutosh Gowariker has carved the story of another Maratha warrior, Sadashiv Rao Bhau, on screen and must say that he has a good idea
 kahaneeye kahani he 14 janvari 1761 main marathaon or afgaanon ke bich ladi gai teesri ladaai ke bare main
 In this battle, Sadashiv Rao Bhau fought a battle with Ahmed Shah Abdali, one of the bloodiest Afghan emperors of the time, and this war was so tremendous that Abdali also owed the bravery and tenacity of the Marathas
 kisi he parformens?film main sadashiv bhau kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he arjuna kapur ne or unka kaam kaabil-e-tarif he
 Arjun Kapoor is playing the role of a brave warrior and despite this, he is seen as a very humble person
 unka gussa, unki namrata or unka deshprem to dekhne laayak he hi saath hi unka kriti senon ke saath romance bhi kaaphi acha he
 Kriti Sanon plays Parvati Bai, wife of Sadashiv Rao Bhau in this film
 ek raaj vaidya kii patni or khud ek kushal raaj vaidya parvati, sadashiv se bachapan se pyaar karti he or usase shaadi karne kii apni ichha ke puraa hone par har mode par sadashiv kaa saath detii he
 Kriti Sanon is very beautiful in this film
 unka luk, unki adaaen or unki acting kamaal kii he
 Kriti is good in every scene and her love for Arjun Kapoor character Sadashiva is worth watching
 itnaa hi nahin yuddh main unki bhagidaari bhi kaaphi dilachasp he
 Also, the chemistry of Kriti Sanon and Arjun Kapoor is beautiful
 un donon par filmaaya gaya gaanaa sapana he sach he dekhte hue aap kisi or hi duniya main kho jaaenge
 View this post on instagrama heartwarming tale of Sadashiv Rao & Parvati Bai against the backdrop of the battle that changed history

 entertainment @zeemusiccompanya post shared byarjun Kapoor(@arjunkapoor) ondec 1, 2019 at 10:30pm pstaba baat karte hai film ke villen ahamed shah abdali ke bare main
 Sanjay Dutt has done amazingly in the character of Abdali
 unka luk dekhakar aapako ek baar ko ranvir singh ke khilji kii yaad aegi, lekin sanjay ke abdali main khilji jaisaa kuch bhi nahin he
 He is a different character of his own, which Sanjay Dutt has played in his different and nice way
 abdali kisi jaanavar se kam nahin he or apane raste main aane vaale kisi bhi insaan ko nahin bakhshata, lekin jab uskaa saamana sadashiv bhau se hota he to use ek nai cheez pataa chalati he
 Apart from Sanjay Dutt, Mantra has also done a great job in Najib's character
 iske saath hi actor sahil salaathia, mohanish bahal, padmini kolhapure, jinat amaan, vineeta mahesh, nawab shah, gashmir mahajanee, suhasini mule or abhishek nigam ne apane kirdaaron ko bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 The supporting starcast along with the lead starcast of this film is very strong and this is what makes this film great
 diarectiondiarector ashutosh goarikar ne ek baar phir sabit kar diya ki unhen kis liye janaa jaataa he
 Ashutosh's way of showing India's history is very different and he has done a great job this time too
 film kii kahani se lekar, actors kaa kaam, cinemetography, ection or yahaan tak kii imotional sikvences or romance sabakuch badhiya he
 You will see the magic of Ashutosh's direction in every frame of this film
 sets behad khubasurat hai
 Although VFX was strange at some places
 kyonki ye ashutosh goarikar kii film he to iskaa lambaa hona bhi banataa he
 The film has a first half slow and is also very long, which takes a test of your patience
 second half main film raftaar pakadati he or aapkaa puraa paisa vasuul hota he
 The film is about 3 hours long, which could have been a bit shorter
 film kaa mujeec ajay atul ne diya he or ye kaaphi badhiya he
 Along with this, the background score of the film is also amazing
 to agar aapako badhiya parformens, badhiya mujeec or desh ke itihaas ke bare main dilchaspee he to panipat ko jarur dekhie
 You will not be disappointed

 40 CRPF personnel were killed in the terror attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir last week
 loksabhaa chunaav se ain pehle hue is aatanki hamale ne desh main aatankwaad ko mudde ko charchaa main laa diya he
 All opposition parties, from the ruling BJP, are strict and unanimous on this issue
 sarkaar or suraksha agenciyon ke har kadam kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed his attitude by mentioning this at the rally in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, on the second day of the terrorist attack
 iske alaava is ghatana ke baad jis tarah se logon kii pratikriya aa rahi he
 It is clear that people are angry with this incident and terrorism seems to be becoming a big issue in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan narendra modi ne seemaa par lagaataar shahid ho rahe sena ke javaanon ko lekar tatkaaleen manmohan sarkaar par kai sawaal khadey kiye the
 He spoke of teaching terrorism a lesson
 2014 main modi sarkaar ke satta main aane ke baad desh main teen bade aatanki hamale hue hai
 These include the Pathankot, Uri and Pulwama incidents
 chhattisgarh ke naksali hamale ke baad siarpief par pulavama main hua hamalaa sabase badi ghatana he, jinamein itani taadaat main jawan shahid hue hai
 After this incident, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that this attack has happened on the soul of India
 aatankwaad ke mudde par sarkaar or sena ke har kadam ke saath hai
 Terrorists should be taught such a lesson that they think again before doing such an incident
 isi ke saath unhone kaha ki agle kuch dinon tak wo raajnneetik baat nahin karenge
 While Prime Minister Narendra Modi left for Jhansi rally after the CCS meeting on the second day of the terrorist attack
 is raily main narendra modi ne kaha tha ki suraksha balon ko saare faisle lene ke liye chhot de gai he
 The nation is angry after this incident
 pulavama hamale ke sajeeshkartaaon ko unke kiye kii sajaa milakar rahegi
 He said that the militancy organizations and their masters have shown their humanity, so that our neighboring country can not do such an act again
 piem modi ne kaha ki aap sabhi kii bhaawanaaon ko main bhalee-bhaanti samaj paa rahaa hum
 Our soldiers have sacrificed their lives in defense of the country
 unka ye balidaan vyarth nahin jayega
 At the same time, BJP President Amit Shah is also raising terrorism in his election rallies
 pulavama aatanki hamale main shaamil aatankwaadiyon ko nishane par lete hue bijepi adhyaksh ne ravivaar ko assam kii raily main kaha ki yah kyrana harakat pakistani aatankwaadiyon ne kii he
 They will not be spared at any cost as there is no longer a Congress government at the Center
 ham kisi bhi suraksha mudde par koi samjhauta nahin karne vaale hai
 Shah claimed that of all the global leaders, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the most will to fight terrorism
 pehle bhi bijepi sarkaar ne pakistan ko kootnithik madhyamon se, goliyon se or sargical strike ke jariye jawaab diya he or aatankwaadiyon ko sabak sikhaaya gaya he
 Although everyone is standing with the government on the issue of terrorism from the opposition side, but in the pretext of attack, Modi did not lag behind the government
 congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne pulavama par pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalaa karte hue kaha tha ki ham is kaayartapurna hamale kii kadi ninda karte hai or shahid hue javaanon ke parajinon ke prati samvednaa prakat karte hai
 This is the 18th major attack in the Modi government in the last five years
 56 inch kaa seenaa kab jawaab degaa?isse saaf jaahir he ki loksabhaa chunaav main aatanki hamale ke bahaane vipaksh modi sarkaar par sawaal khadey kar saktaa he
 In fact, the way the issue is being continuously raised in the election rallies towards the BJP
 aise main vipaksh is mudde par sarkaar ko gherne kii kavayad kar saktaa he, kyonki pulavama ghatana ke baad jis tarah se logon main gussa he
 Clearly, terrorism can emerge as a major issue in elections
 rashtriya suraksha ke lihaaj se data saajha karnaa ahmadata ko desh kii seemaa main baandhakar rakhana thik nahinfasebuk ink ne reliance industries ke chairman mukesh ambani ke bayaan kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki data koi nayaa tel nahin he
 Countries like India should allow free flow of data to other countries instead of intercepting it within the country
 fasebuk ke upaadhyaksh (videsh maamle evam sanchaar) nik cleg ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki rashtriya suraksha ke lihaaj se data saajha karnaa ahm he
 Nick Clegg said that India kept itself out of major global data-sharing initiatives amid tightening its grip on serious crime and terrorism
 unhone kaha, 'bharat ko internet ke liye ek nayaa khaakaa taiyaar karnaa chahie jo vyaktigat adhikaron kaa sammaan karata ho
 Also encourage competition and innovation and be free and easily available to all
 'data ko rokna saraasar galatagauratlab he ki reliance ke chairman mukesh ambani ne kuch samay pehle kaha tha ki data ek nae tel kii tarah he
 Indian data should be controlled and owned by the Indian people, not by data companies or especially by foreign companies
 cleg ne dilli main ek kaarykram main is par jawaab dete hue kaha ki, "bharat or puri duniya main aise kai log hai jo data ko nayaa tel samajhate hai or unka maananaa he ki is tarah ke tel (data) ke bhandar ko desh kii seemaa ke bheetar rakhane se samruddhi aegi
 However, this is completely wrong to believe
 "samachar agency pitiai ke anusaar cleg ne kaha, "data koi tel nahin he
 That which should be taken out of the land and kept under its control and traded
 yah navachaar ke vishaal samudr ke rup main he
 "clegg said that the value of data does not derive from" hoarding "or its trading as a finite commodity, but should allow free flow of data
 yah navachaar ko badhaava detaa he
 Clegg said that "keeping this data within the country's border and preventing its flow to another country" would turn the vast sea of innovation into a lake
 "mukt pravaah se hi iskaa prabhavakleg ne kaha ki data tel nahin he
 Data is not a limited commodity that can be monopolized, traded and removed from the ground and burned in cars and factories
 agar aap ko data kii kisi liquid se tulana kerani hi he to pani se kiijie
 The global internet is like a vast and borderless sea
 data kaa mulya ise jamaa karke rakhane yaa kisi simit vastu ke jaise iskaa vyapaar karne se nahin aati, balki iske mukt pravaah se hone vaale innovations se aayega
 The algorithms and services and intelligence that will be created from this data will reveal the value of this data
 unhone kaha ki is innovations main kshamta he ki bharat main badi daulat laa sake, or yah innovations hi aane vaale dashakon main bharat ko global internet main sabase aage rakhega
 Clegg said that India should create a new template for the Internet that gives people the right to decide what will happen to their data
 aisa template jo compatishan or innovations ko badhaava de or jo sabhi ke liye khulaa ho or har kisi kii pahunch main ho

 The Supreme Court ordered - The government should form a trust in three months
 lekin trust ko lekar tarah-tarah ke vivaad shuru ho gaye hai
 No bill to set up a trust to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya is coming in the winter session of Parliament
 kaanoon mantralay ne guuruuvaar ko ye baat saafe kar di he
 But the buzz has started inside and outside the government regarding the trust
 guuruuvaar ko ayodhya se aae ram janmabhumi raamaalaya nyaas ne baqayada mandir nirmaan kii zimmedaari par apana daawa thok diya
 The Trust has also handed over a memorandum to the PMO and Home Secretary
 chetavanee court tak jane kii he
 Avimukteshwarananda Saswati, secretary of the Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi Ramalaya Trust, told NDTV, “the responsibility of building the temple rests with the Dharmacharyas
 
 
 agar sarkaar ne hathdharmi dikhaai to ham maamle ko lekar adaalat jaaenge
 This option is before us
 "jabaki ram janmabhumi nyaas bhi yahi daawa kar rahaa he ki trust bana hua he, nae trust kii zarurat nahin he
 And the Nirmohi Akhara says that the new trust that is formed should have an important role in it, this court has said
 nirmohi akhaada ke pravaktaa karthik chopra ne enditivi se kaha, "court ne kaha he ki trust main nirmohi akhaade kaa samuchit pratinidhitiv hoga
 We want clarity from the government as to how the Nirmohi Arena will be kept in the trust and what will be its role in the functioning of the trust
 "ayodhya vivaad par supreme court ke faisle ke baad ab hindu dharmik sanghathanon main is baat ko lekar hode lag gai he ki nae prastaavit trust main kisko shaamil kiya jaae, kise ahm bhoomika saunpi jaae or mandir nirmaan kii zimmedaari kiskon saunpi jaae
 
 
 Clearly, the matter is sensitive and complex, and the government will have to deal with these claims carefully

 vitt varsh 2017-18 main beasenel kaa ghaataa 7,992 karod rupee tha2016-17 main company kaa ghaataa 4,786 karod rupee rahamodi sarkaar ne cabinet baithak main beasenel or emtnael ko lekar bada faisla kiya he
 In fact, the plan of merger of BSNL and MTNL has been approved in the cabinet meeting
 lambey samay se ghate main chal rahi in donon sarkari companiyon ke liye yah raahat kii khabar he
 For the past few days, there were reports that the government is planning to shut down both government telecom companies
 haalanki baad main sarkaar kii ore se is khabar ko sirf afvaah bataaya gaya
 What said: While announcing the decisions of the Cabinet Minister of Modi Government, Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that there has been injustice in the past with BSNL
 ham beasenel or emtnael ke vilay kii yojana par kaam kar rahe hai
 According to Ravi Shankar Prasad, an attractive VRS package will be brought for BSNL
 iske saath hi 4 ji spectrum ke liye kareeb 4000 karod rupee bajtiy praavdhaan karenge
 He informed that 38000 crore rupees will be monetized in the next 4 years
 vahiin 15 hajaar karod ke bond bhi jari kiye jaaenge
 Loss-making BSNL had applied to the government in 2015 for the allocation of 4G spectrum and sought approval for the voluntary retirement scheme package which was pending since 2009
 iske alaava sarkaar ne bataaya ki duusari companiyaan bhi petrol-dijal ke retail outlets khol sakengi
 The problem facing the employees is Union Cabinet approves revival plan of BSNL (bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited) & MTNL (mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited) & in-principle merger of the two
 Spectrum of 4G to be allocated to Telecom pses (public Sector Enterprises)

 https: / / t
 co / klueorln9a — ANI (@ANI) October 23, 2019 Employees continue to suffer due to the plight of BSNL and MTNL
 unhen selary milane main bhi deree ho rahi he
 Actually, BSNL has to pay Rs 850 crore as monthly salary
 abhi beasenel ke paas kareeb 1
 There are 8 million employees
 bataa den ki vitt varsh 2017-18 main beasenel kaa ghaataa 7,992 karod rupee tha
 Earlier, the company had a loss of Rs 4,786 crore in 2016-17
 is hisaab se sirf 1 saal main 3,206 karod rupee kaa ghaataa hua he
 The government refused to move a motion of confidence in view of the deadlock in Parliament on the issue of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report on coal block allocation
 sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya sarkaar kii vishwaas prastaav laane kii yojana he, unhone kaha, ‘aisi koi yojana nahin he
 'they said,' Why should we bring it
 agar vipaksh avishvaas prastaav laana chahta he to yah gir jaayegaa
 Bansal also laughed that due to the deadlock, the monsoon session of Parliament would be postponed indefinitely before its scheduled schedule of September 7
 unhone kaha ki loksabhaa pradhanmantri ke bayaan par niyam 193 ke tahat charchaa karegi
 Lalu Prasad of RJD, Shailendra Kumar of SP, Ramchandra Dome of CPI-M and B
 Mehtab of BJD have given notice in this regard

 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne modi sarkaar par tikhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha he ki desh kii loktantric sansthaaon ke liye khatara paidaa ho gaya he
 Addressing the National Session of NSUI, Manmohan said that efforts are being made to continuously break the social texture of the country
 ise rokane ke liye yuvaaon ko zimmedaari uthaani hogi
 This is Manmohan's biggest attack on the Modi government
 arthshaastra ke jaankaar manmohan ne na sirf raajnneetik aarope lagaae balki bijepi sarkaar kii aarthik nitiyon par bhi sawaal uthaae
 Said that there is a steady decline in agricultural production
 gaanvon main rahane vaali desh kii 65 fisadi aabaadi santusht nahin he
 Exports are declining
 bijepi sarkaar ke dauraan arthvyavastha main sabakuch thik nahin chal rahaa
 But in the last one year, the BJP government is trying to show that by storing many statistics and facts that the condition of the economy is not as bad
 manmohan ne bijepi ke is aarope ko galat bataaya ki upie sarkaar policy paralisis kii shikaar thi
 Manmohan said that the average annual growth rate during our government was eight and a half percent which was a record
 china ke baad bharat duniya main sabase tezi se vikaas karne vaale desh tha
 But there is no hawk by spreading lies
 manmohan singh pradhanmantri modi ke mek in india ko upie sarkaar kii utpaadan niti kaa carbon copy qaraar diya
 Said that the policies of the UPA are working for him
 modi sarkaar par hamale ke alaava manmohan ne apane upar lag rahe bhrashtachar ke aaropon par safai bhi di
 Said that he never used his position and office to benefit himself or his family or friend
 bijepi un par bebuniyaad aarope lagati rahi he
 The comments manmohan kii safai par bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne jawaab diya ki pradhanmantri kii zimmedaari sirf khud bhrashtachar nahin karne kii nahin hoti he balki duusare ko bhi bhrashtachar na karne dene kii bhi hoti he
 Manmohan failed in this
 bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne sawaal uthaaya ki manmohan ne apana maun ab kyon todaa he
 When the Prime Minister was asking the question, why did he not speak? congress lagaataar modi sarkaar par hamale kar rahi he
 Manmohan gave her another edge today
 chunavi haar ke baad haashie par chale gaye manmohan ke lagata he party main achche din phir se aa gaye hai
 With his presence at the NSUI session, the message is also clear that the Congress is trying to connect the youth with Manmohan's experiences so that the party can be strengthened at the ground level
 modi sarkaar par manmohan kaa ye sabase bada hamalaa he
 Economist Manmohan not only made political allegations but also questioned the economic policies of the BJP government
 kaha ki krishi utpaadan main lagaataar giravat aa rahi he
 65 percent of the country's population living in villages is not satisfied
 niryaat main kami aa rahi he
 Everything is not going well in the economy during the BJP government
 lekin pichley ek saal main bijepi sarkaar kai aankadon or tathyon ko garh kar ye jataane kii koshish kar rahi he ki arthvyavastha kii haalat utani kharaab nahin he
 Manmohan termed the bjp's allegation that the UPA government was a victim of policy paralysis
 manmohan ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar ke dauraan ausat salanaa vikaas dar saadhe aath fisadi thi jo ki ek record rahi
 India was the fastest growing country in the world after China
 lekin jhooth failaane se baj nahin aa rahi
 Manmohan Singh termed Prime Minister Modi's Make in India a carbon copy of the production policy of the UPA government
 kaha ki upie kii nitiyaan hi unke kaam aa rahi hai
 Apart from the attack on the Modi government, Manmohan also clarified the allegations of corruption leveled against him
 kaha ki unhone kabhi bhi apane pad or daftar kaa istemaal khud yaa apane parivaar yaa dost ko phayda pahunchane ke liye nahin kiya
 BJP has been accusing them of baseless allegations
 tippaniyan On Manmohan's clarification, BJP President Amit Shah replied that the Prime Minister's responsibility is not only not to do corruption but also to not let others do corruption
 manmohan isamen naakaamayaab rahe
 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra questioned why Manmohan has broken his silence now
 pradhanmantri rahete jab janata sawaal puch rahi thi tab kyon nahin bolaa
 The Congress is constantly attacking the Modi government
 manmohan ne aaj use or dhar de diya
 Manmohan, who has been marginalized after the electoral defeat, feels good days have come again in the party
 enesayuai ke adhiveshan main unki maujuudagi se ye sandesh bhi saaf he ki congress yuva josh ko manmohan ke anubhavon se jodna chaah rahi he taaki party ko jamini str par majbooti se khadaa kiya ja sake

 Congress media department head Ajay Maken said Vajpayee's NDA government in its initial phase had 14 'double Taxation Avoidance Treaty' (DTAA) containing the Articles of Privacy
 unamem se teen sanshodhan the, lekin is mudde par punarvichaar karne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya gaya
 Maken questioned Jaitley's allegation that the DTAA with Germany was done on 19 June 1995, when the Congress party was in power
 congress netaa ne vitt mantralay kii website kaa ek kathith snapashaat dikhaate hue kaha ki website ke anusaar germany ke saath is sandhi par sitambar 1996 main dastakhat kiye gaye or isaki adhisuchana november 1996 main kii gai jab congress kii sarkaar nahin thi
 When the reporters asked him if Jaitley was lying, he said, 'maybe he will have some other documents
 
 But this is not the main thing

 Jaitley later alleged that Congress had entered into a treaty with Germany in 1995 which was a hindering factor in making the details of black money public
 jetali ke is aarope ko khaarij karte hue maakan ne is mudde par bhaajapa par joardaar hamalaa karte hue modi samet bhaajapa ke varisht netaaon ke anek bayanon kaa udhaaharan diya, jisamen unhone kaala dhan waapas laane or jald hi logon ko saunpane kii baat kahi thi
 Many of them are now ministers
 congress netaa ne kaha, 'modi ne kaha tha ki agar kaala dhan waapas laayaa gaya to har naagarik ko 15 lakh rupee hoga
 Rajnath Singh said that the black money stashed abroad will be brought back within 100 days
 main apana 15 lakh rupaya maangata hum
 i demand that 15 lakh rupees should reach my pocket, in your pocket
 ' Maken said, 'none of these promises are fulfilled

 ' Posters by the Election Commission outside the Karnataka Assembly are telling how many young voters are going to exercise their voting rights for the first time in this election

 There are 85 lakh youth voters out of which 15
 42 lakh pehali baar vot daalane ja rahe hai
 Do both Congress and BJP want to leave no stone unturned to woo young voters? donon partiyaan alag se youth menifesto laane kii bhi taiyaari kar rahi he
 The Janata Dal Secular (JDS) has also launched a campaign to connect young volunteers with whatsapp
 congress kaa ‘nanna karnataka’ abhiyaancongress ne karnataka ke yuva votaron tak pahunchane ke liye ‘nanna karnataka’ yani ‘meraa karnataka’ abhiyaan shuru kiya he
 Under this campaign, youth will be reached in all the youth hubs including the town halls, campus
 saath hi nukkad sabhaayen bhi kii jaaengi
 According to KC Venugopal, Congress general secretary in-charge for Karnataka, any feedback from the youth of Karnataka will be added to the party manifesto
 venugopal ne india today se kaha, ‘hamaari yojana yuva logon ke jehan tak pahunch kar unki aakankshaon ko samajhane kii he
 We have asked the youth leaders of the party associated with the Center and the state to go to campus-campus, street-street, dhaba-dhaba and communicate with the young people
 in yuvaaon kii raay hamaare liye bahut ahm he
 'congress knows that even in the Karnataka elections, the BJP will put forward the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and ask for votes from the youth
 isaki kaat ke liye bhi congress ye jaanati he ki bijepi ek baar phir pradhanmantri narendra modi ke naam ko karnataka main bhunaane kii koshish karegi
 To counter this, the Congress has chalked out a strategy to emphasize specific questions related to the youth during the campaign
 masalan--beete chaar saal main pradhanmantri modi ne yuvaaon ke liye kya kiya?-centre kii ore se nae rojgaar dene kii jagah bade paimaane par naukariyaan gayi?-oonchi shiksha hasil karnaa mahangaa hua
 According to Venugopal, these issues related to youth are already being emphasized by Rahul Gandhi, these will also be raised prominently in the party campaign
 congress ne apane frontal sanghathanon- youth congress or NSUI ko bhi collejon or uniwarsity campus main phul active mod main rahane ke liye kaha he
 AICC general secretary in-charge of party frontal organizations Madhu Gaur Yakshi says- 'it is a big challenge to win over young voters
 ‘nanna karnataka’ abhiyaan ke jariye yuvaaon ko bataaya jayega ki congress ne karnataka ko global destination banane ke liye kya kya kiya
 According to Yakshi, these facts will also be put in front of the young voters that in the last four and a half years, no job has been done in Karnataka, employment is being created in the state under the Siddaramaiah government, free bus passes are being given to students, girls are given free Laptops are being provided along with education
 ’bijepi kii ‘vin youth stritegi’bijepi bhi karnataka ke yuvaaon ko aakarshith karne ke liye khaas ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 BJP is confident that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the youth had expressed great confidence in Narendra Modi, so will the Karnataka Assembly elections
 yahi vajah he ki karnataka ke liye bijepi ke campan main yuva pramukhataa se dikhenge
 In this direction, BJP has prepared a different strategy for both urban and rural areas in Karnataka
 party sutron ke mutabik shahari kshetron main yuvaaon ko lubhaane ke liye iti profeshnals kii sevaayen lee ja rahi hai
 In the rural areas, ABVP and student leaders have been asked to reach out to maximum youth
 bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv pi muralidhar raav ke mutabik karnataka ke yuvaaon main change factor bada mudda he, isliye party us par focus kar rahi he
 Rao said, 'youth for BJP, especially first-time voters, have always been very important
 hamaara focus rojgaar, shiksha, takanic ke vikaas jaise sabhi pahaluon ke saath karnataka ke bhavishya ko aakaar dene par he
 There are definitely some announcements to be made in the BJP manifesto in this regard
 ’kaha, bijepi ne hameshaa yuva votaron or pehali baar ke matadaataaon par focus kiya he
 We are looking at employment, education, technology upgradation
 kis tarah karnataka ke bhavishya ko aakaar diya jaae
 Change is needed and the change factor is an important issue among the youth
 isaliebijapi us parfocus kar rahi he
 We are going to make certain announcements in the manifest
 yuvaaon ko lubhaane main jedies bhi peeche nahincongress or bijepi kii tarah hi jedies ko bhi chunaav main yuvasakti kii ahmiyat acchhee tarah pataa he
 This is the reason JDS has started a campaign to connect young volunteers through whatsapp

 If your bedroom is not behind it, there is tension between the husband and wife if the condition of the bed in the bedroom is not correct or there is negative energy
 sehat ke saath mali haalat bhi sudhaar sakati he chaandi, jaaniye kaise
 
 
 How can the relationship between husband and wife be strengthened, let us know some tips 1
 bistar khidki se sataakar kabhi bhi na lagaaein

 2
 Avoid using anything in the bedroom that indicates isolation
 3
 The presence of a beam on the roof and the use of two separate mattresses also create distance in love affairs

 5
 palang ke neeche kuch bhi saamaan na rakhen
 Leave the space under the bed empty, this will allow positive energy to flow around your bed without any hindrance
