 ) In the current era of cricket, Albert Trott's name may seem unknown, but the name of this cricketer has a shocking record
 hairaani vaali baat to yah he ki australia main paidaa hue is olerounder ne 41 saal kii umr main aaj hi ke din (30 july) 1914 main khud ko goli maar lee thi
 But even today Trott's record thrills
 australia or england donon taraf se test khelekarishmai cricketer trot kaa test kariyar mahaj paanch test kaa rahaa
 He played Test matches for both Australia and England teams (3 Tests from Australia and 2 Tests from England)
 trot ne janvari 1895 main edilade main england ke khilaaf debyue kiya tha
 The first bowler who took 8 wickets in an innings debut, became the first bowler to take 8 wickets in his first Test innings
 unke baad se debyue test kii pari main abtak 8 gendbaajon ne 8-8 wicket jatke hai
 But the record of taking 8 wickets for the fewest runs is still in the name of a right-handed slow bowler trot
 dekhie ye list-top-3: debyue test main sabase kifayati 8 wicket lene vaale1
 Albert Trott (australia): 27 overs, 10 maidens, 43 runs, 8 wickets, 18952
 bob mesi (australia) : 27
 2 overs, 9 maidens, 53 runs, 8 wickets, 19723
 narendra hirwani (bharat) : 18
 3 overs, 3 maidens, 61 runs, 8 wickets, 1988
 
 
 to isliye australia chhodkar england chale gaealbert trot ne australia kii ore se teen test main 102
 Scored at an average of 50
 phir bhi australian silectors ne unhen tavajjo nahin di or 1896 ke daure ke liye team main nahin chunaa
 Despite this, Trott did not lose courage and went to England at his own expense
 jahaan unhen county cricket main middlesex kii taraf se khilne kaa mauka mil gaya
 After this, in 1898 Trott gave England's behalf
 africa main 2 test khele
 In 1899, the only cricketer to hit the biggest six at Lord's was Trott's massive blast when the Australian team visited England
 darasal, lords main 31 july ko emsisi or australia ke bich khele gaye match main trot ne australia ke monti nobel kii gend par aisa chakka jamaaya ki itihaas bana gaya
 Trott is the only player to land a six over the Lord's Pavilion
 pratham shrenee cricket kii ek pari main do hetric kaa karnama1892-1910 ke dauraan trot ne 375 pratham shrenee match khele
 Victoria and Middlesex were their teams
 unhone 21
 Took 1674 wickets at an average of 09
 middlesex ne 1907 main trot kaa benifit match karaayaa, summerset ke khilaaf lords main trot kaa chamatkaari pradarshan aaj bhi hairaan karata he
 Indeed, Trott became the first bowler to take two hat-tricks in a single innings in the first class
 -match ke tisare din summerset ko jeet ke liye 264 ran chahie the
 It was expected that spectators would gather at noon on the last day of this benefit match
 lekin vah match trot kii ek ke baad ek - do hetric kii vajah se bahut jaldi khatm ho gaya
 Money could not be raised for trot
 yani trot ne khud kaa ghaataa kara liya
 -hua Yun that Somerset's team had scored 77 / 2 chasing the target
 trot ne hetric lee or score 77 / 6 ho gaya
 After this the score was 97 / 7, then once again Trott took the hat-trick and amassed the entire team
 trot kaa gendbaaji vishleshan rahaa- 8-2-20-7
 Suicidal Keytrot was already out of the race to play the test after the illness went into depression
 1910 main unhone pratham shrenee cricket se bhi khud ko alag kar liya or ampiring main haath aajamaaya
 Meanwhile, he succumbed to a disease called dropsy (dropsy - watering in the stomach)
 dhire-dhire trot zyada sharaab pine lage
 After this, he was constantly in depression
 or aakhirkaar unhone khud ko pistal se goli maar lee
 After the interesting FACT Albert Trott, Joginder Rao did the work of taking two hat-tricks in the innings of first class cricket
 1963-64 main nordarn punjab ke khilaaf amritsar main unhone apane duusare match main hi yah uplabdhi hasil kii
 Playing for the army, Joginder also took a hat-trick in his debut against Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi

 'big bos' ke is sijan main kai kaarnon se sonaali raut sabase zyada surkhiyon main rahi he
 Whether he had a fight with Diandra or close ties with Upen and Gautam
 sonaali ne 'big bos' ke ghar main kaaphi kuch dekh liya he
 But what has emerged most in the midst of all this is the growing close of Gautam and Sonali

 Sonali told that she does not know how to express her feelings
 haalanki, raat main sonaali pranit ke saamne gautam ke saath baat karne kii koshish karti he
 But she is unable to talk and she starts talking to Praneeth
 tab pranit sonaali kaa saath dete hai
 Praneeth tells Gautam why he does not proceed
 gautam bade pyaar se kahata he, 'sabar kaa fal meetha hota he
 'praneeth says,' Sometimes the fruit ripen while we are patient, and if it is not broken at the right time, it will fall apart
 'gautam pranit kii baat ko tavajjo detaa he or kahata he ki vah kuch karegaa
 On leaving Sonali says that she will wait
 gautam sonaali se kahata he ki vah jald hi uske paas aayega
 After the light goes off, Sonali and Gautam are seen talking in the same bed
 yani ab 'big bos' ke ghar main pyaar ke phool khilne lage hai

 ek gaanv ke logon ne to ajab faisla kar daalaa he ki jo vyakti yaa parivaar talab kii marammat main jitna shramdan yaa anshdaan karegaa, use usee ke anupaat main kheti kii sinchai or dainik upyog ke liye pani milegaa
 Shuklan Tauria is a small village under the village village of Bangaon in Tikamgarh district
 yah gaanv pahaad ke kinare basaa he or yahaan tak pahunchane ke liye sadak bhi nahin he
 This village has a Chandelaal pond, but due to the leakage, the rainwater stops every year for a few months
 majabuuran gaanv ke logon se lekar maweshiyon tak kopani ke liye dar-dar bhatakanapadataa he
 The people of the village have been trying to improve the pond for a long time
 lekin prashasan or sarkaar se guhaar lagane par bhi koi madad nahin mili
 So now the villagers themselves took up this task
 shuklan toria ke nivaasiyon ne aasapaas ke kshetra main ekikrutjal prabandhan mishanke tahat chal rahe kaamon ke jariye apane gaanv ke talab kii marammat kii koshish kii
 Sarpanch Lilavati Shukla said that he sought cooperation from the 'paramarth Samaj Seva' institute in pond repair
 santhaan ne talab sudhaar kaary kaa kharch taiyaar kiya to kul kharch saadhe teen lakh rupee aanka gaya
 The institution's condition was that community participation in the repair work was necessary
 iske liye gaanv ke log marammat par aane vaale kul kharch kii das pratishat raashi ke baraabar shramdan yaa anshdaan karen
 a total of 80 families belonging to Brahmins, Backward and Dalit sections live in this village and the pond irrigates about 70 acres of land
 shramdan aushanshadaan ke masale par gaanv ke logon kii baithak bulaai gai
 Dhaniram Ahirwar told that it was decided in the meeting that it would be difficult to keep an account of Shramdaan
 lihaaja marammat par kharch hone vaali kul raashi kaa 10 pratishat 30 hajaar rupee aapas main ikattha kiya jaae iske liye kheti kii jameen par prati acre 412 rupee kii raashi tay kii gai
 Local resident Baijnath Pal said, 'all the people of the village agreed to deposit the amount of Rs 412 per acre
 jisaki jitani kheti kii jameen he, usne usee anupaat main raashi jamaa kii he
 The pond is being repaired, it is expected that rain water will not be wasted this time and will not have to wander for farming and daily use water
 'santhaan ke pramukh sanjay singh ne kaha, 'gaanv waalon se 10 pratishat raashi saamudayik hissedari banaae rakhane ke liye lee gai he
 This is the reason that the people of the village are not only keeping an eye on the repair work of the pond, but are also helping to maintain the quality
 unhone kaha, 'gaanv ke log khud kharch kaa lekha-jokha rakhte hai
 If the community participates in development work, then there is no possibility of corruption anywhere
 'shuklan torio gaanv ke logon ne talab kii marammat ke liye anshdaan kar vikaas main saamudayik hissedari kii vah ibaarat likhane kii koshish kii he, jo aane vaale samay main duusare gaanv ke liye prerana kaa kaaran ban sakati he

 In fact, according to DNA reports, given the falling ratings of the Kapil Sharma show, Sony is once again bringing Salman Khan's superhit game show 'dus Ka Dum' as a replacement for the show

 In such a situation, the channel wants to extend the TRP of Kapil's show to Salman Khan now
 tippaniyan Due to the dispute between Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover, Sunil Grover and many actors got away from the show and after this Kapil's comedy show was in a bad condition

 ' After the announcement of demonetisation, the Modi government had claimed that it would waste black money, but the speed with which the banks are replenishing old currency notes, these claims seem to be hollow
 sarkari aankade bataate hai ki shanivaar shaam tak 9
 500 and 1,000 rupee notes worth 85 lakh crores have been deposited in banks
 centre sarkaar kaa maananaa tha ki notebandi ke baad kareeb 3 lakh karod rupee kakala dhanbainkon main nahin aayega
 December 30 is the last date to deposit old notes in banks, that is, people still have time
 isse pehle bainkon main or rupee jamaa hone kii sambhaavna ke chalate 3 lakh karod kii rakam kaa anumaan ghat saktaa he
 Sources of black money turned out to be white, the sources say that the government had expected 14
 6 lakh karod kaa 10 fisadi bainkon main jamaa nahin hoga lekin ab tak jamaa ho chukaa rakam or note badalane kii aakhri taarikh ko abhi vakt ko dekhte hue sarkaar kii ummiido par pani phirata dikh rahaa he
 It is clear that the corrupt have found a way to turn black money white
 haalanki sarkaar bhi kaala dhan rakhane waalon kii chaalaakiyon ko samajhakar aae din nae badlaav kar rahi he
 Government is constantly changing the rules PM Modi said that the money should be deposited in Jan Dhan accounts at a fast pace

 After this, the government fixed the limit of withdrawing only 10,000 rupees a month from these Jan Dhan accounts
 kaale dhan kii barbaadi nahin, ab kaale dhan kii vaapasi kii batsutron kaa kahana he ki kuch kaala dhan ab bhi arthvyavastha se baahar rahegaa
 The central government has shifted its focus from black money to the amount of money that corrupt people have disclosed
 notebandi ke turant bad puraane noton ko ganga main pravaah karne kii baat karne vaale piem modi ne shanivaar ko muradabad kii raily main kaale dhan ke waapas aane kii baat kahi

 The study's leader, Professor Robin Shiman, admitted that she was surprised to see the results because the general thought was that women who are prone to emotional turmoil in relationships are susceptible

 'but if the romance is going well then the man is more benefited
 surveykshan 1000 avaivaahik yuvak yuvatiyon par kiya gaya jinaki umr 18 se 23 saal ke bich thi
 Shiman said that the survey revealed that young people believe in very few people while women have more close relations with their family and friends
 isaki ek vajah yuvakon main pahchaan or atmasamman kii adhik bhaavana bhi he
 According to him, the fact is that men and women express emotions differently

 The late Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave the gift he received from his then Soviet Union counterpart Alexey Kosygin during a visit to Tashkent in 1966 to one of his employees, on whom Alexey called him a 'super communist'
 isi daure ke dauraan shastriji kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 Many such sentences about the Second Prime Minister of India have been mentioned by his son and co-author Anil Shastri and author Pawan Chaudhary in the book 'lal Bahadur Shastri: Lessons in Leadership'
 kitaab main kaha gaya he ki pakistan ke raashtrapati general ayub khan se jis din shastri 3 janvari 1966 ko bhent karne vaale the us din kadaake kii thand thi or vah us din bhi apana khaadi oon kaa kot hi pahane hue the
 According to the book, Kosijin felt that the coat Shastri is wearing is not as hot for this icy cold weather in Central Asia and wanted to give him a Russian overcoat but was in a tizzy about how to offer it to him
 lekhakon kaa kahana he, aakhirkaar ek samaaroh main yah ummid karte hue kosigin ne pradhanmantri ko tohfe ke taur par roosi kot bhent kiya ki vah taashkand main ise pahanenge
 The next morning he saw that Shastriji was still wearing his own coat which he had brought from Delhi
 hichkichaate hue unhone pradhanmantri se poocha ki jo kot unhen bhent diya gaya kya vah unhen pasand aayaa
 He has written, Shastriji replied yes and said, it is really hot and very comfortable for me
 haalanki, maine use apane ek karmchaaree ko de diya he, jo is kanpakanpati thand main pahanane ke liye badhiya oonee kot nahin laae the
 i will definitely use your offering during my visits to cold countries
 kosigin ne shastri or khan ke sammaan main yojit ek saanskrithik kaarykram main apane sambodhan ke dauraan is vaakye kaa zikr kiya
 He said, we are communists but Prime Minister Shastri is super communist

 One day, the sons complain to their father that the children of government officials arrive by car, while they go to school with a tanga
 shastriji ne unase kaha ki car se skool pahunchane kii suvidha unhen tab tak hi mil sakegi jab tak vah grahamantri rahenge or baad ke dinon main phir se tanga par jane main unhen bura lagegaa
 The children realized the principle of their father and decided to leave Tanga
 kitaab main un pahaluon kaa bhi zikr he ki 1965 ke yuddh jaise sankat ke samay main shastri prashasan or raajnneeti ke muddon se kaise nipate
 In another chapter, Anil has also mentioned how his father dealt with the resignation of TT Krishnamachari, the then finance minister known as TTK
 unhone likhaa he, mujhe yaad he ki mere pita ne tatkaaleen congress adhyaksh kamraj se telephone par baat kii jo us samay chennai main the or unhen bataaya ki unhone titike kaa istipha sweekaar kar liya he or sachindra choudhary ko nayaa vitt mantri niyukt kiya he
 Kaushal Kumar, a relative close to me, was present in the room and wondered if Congress President would be angry with Shastriji as to why he was not consulted before such a decision
 shastriji ne unase namrata or dridhta se kaha, pradhanmantri kaa visheshadhikaar he ki cabinet main kise rakhaa janaa chahie or kise nahin or vah apana visheshadhikaar kisi tarah se ganvaana nahin chaahate

 The prices of petrol and diesel are constantly increasing
 pehle kachche tel kii keemten ghatane ke baad bhi aam logon ko isse raahat nahin mili
 Now the prices of crude oil have also started increasing
 isse petrol-dijal kii keemton main kami aane ke asaar philhal nahin dikh rahe
 But the increase in the prices of petrol and diesel in the country is not only responsible for the increase in the prices of crude oil, but also the tax imposed by the government is a reason
 bhale hi aapaki jeb par petrol-dijal kii keemten lagaataar daaka daal rahi hon, lekin sarkaar ko isse acha-khaasaa rajasav hasil hua he or ho rahaa he
 2 from petrol-diesel to the government in FY 2016-17

 Government's earnings have increased year after year, the government has given this information in response to the RTI filed by social activist Chandrashekhar Gaur of Madhya Pradesh

 According to the data provided by the government's IDGSDM, the government earned Rs 98,602 crore from petrol and diesel in FY13
 vitt varsh 2013-14 main sarkaar ne petrol-dijal kii badaulat 104,163 karod rupee kamaaye
 In FY15, this earnings rose to Rs 122,926 crore
 2015-16 main sarkaar kii aay petrol-dijal se 203,825 lakh karod rupee ho gaya
 The government's earnings from petrol and diesel have increased 5 times in just 5 years
 126 fisadi badhaai gai exise dutioyal companiyon ke str par 31 rupye main 1 litre petrol taiyaar ho jaataa he
 After that, tax is collected from the central government
 iskaa matlab he ki aap 48 rupye se zyada to sirf tex de rahe hai
 Since 2014, the central government has increased excise duty on petrol by 126 percent
 vahiin, dijal par lagane vaali duty main 374 fisadi kii badhottaree hui he
 This is the reason why you are not getting the benefit of crude oil prices continuously for some time

 It will draw attention
 The film draws attention to the difference between the boy-girl and the issue of dowry-taking which may be eye-opening
 - film ke saath chote shahar ke bheetar hone vaali gatividhiyon ke bare main bhi baatcheet kii gai he jisase kaaphi log conect kar sakenge
 - Direction of the film is good

 The film's weak link is its typical story
 loketions ke bich main gumti kahani kabhi bhatki hui to kabhi khinchi hui mahasoos hoti he
 In Singapore, many alcoholic scenes, family meeting scenes, the attitude of the Singapore Police are very artificial
 'badri kii dulhaniya' kaa nayaa song, 'humsafar' bane varun-aalia- film main romance, imoshan or masti dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he lekin bahut dhire-dhire badhati kahani ko ksaa ja saktaa tha
 - The issue of discrimination between boys and girls has also been raised, but the makers are not completely successful in showing it vigorously
 - film main samvaad puri tarah ek hi andaaj se bole gaye hai jisase shaayad multiplex adiens 100% conect naa kar paaen kyonki aajkal zyaadaatar hinglish main hi baat hoti he
 Will the film be a box office hit? Most of the production of Johar's production is made in the control budget

 So if the film earns 70-75 crores then the cost will recover

 har match main koi ek lamhaa aisa jarur hota he, jo fans kii zindagi kaa hissaa ban jaataa he
 Before the match in the World Cup on Sunday, Pakistan captain misbah-ul-haq said openly that this match is completely under pressure
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki aap dressing room main is match ke bare main kaise sochate hai, ye sab iske nattejey ko prabhavit karata he
 Captain Kool Mahi also believes that this match is a little different from other matches, but believes that his effort is to reduce this 'slightly different' factor
 captain kool maahi yah bhi kehete hai ki in maichon main fans kaa role bahut ahm ho jaataa he isliye romaanch bahut bad jaataa he
 Before the World Cup collision for the sixth time, both the teams are presenting their claim by telling about their strength, but both the captains are refraining from making a claim
 darasal, donon hi timen mushkilon ke daur se guzar kar world cap khilne pahunchi hai
 Nevertheless, Pakistan's bowling edge has been sharper in recent times, while on paper the whole world admits the fear of Team India's batting, but the record of not winning against India in the World Cup is such a thing, which is in Pakistan's zen Every four years, a loud alarm clock starts ringing
 match se pehle yah awaz or tej ho jaati he
 Changing this history in front of Captain Misbah ul Haq kaa shaayad is baar behatar mauqaa he, lekin yah baat bhi un par dabaav badha sakati he, yani khilaadi chaahe jo kar len maidan par utarane se pehle dabaav se kisi surat main nahin batch sakate

 aamir khan or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bich ek alag tarah kaa rishta he jo aamtaur par kisi celebrity or rajaneta ke bich dekhne ko nahin miltaa
 Recently Bollywood stars appealed to the countrymen to cast their votes on social media
 modi ne khaas taur par aamir or salmaan kii film andaaz apana apana kaa reference lete hue kaha tha ki aap jaise sitaron ko logon ko vot daalane ke liye motivet karnaa chahie
 Aamir Khan also responded to this tweet by the PM and said that casting a vote is a big responsibility in any democracy
 aamir se unke 54wein berth de par poocha gaya ki kya ve aam chunaavon main bijepi ko saport karenge to aamir ne saaf kiya tha ki ve kisi bhi political party ko saport nahin karte hai
 Voting is not only a right but it's also a duty
 dear@beingsalmankhanand@aamir_khan,it is time to inspire and motivate youth in your own Andaz to vote so that we can strengthen Apna Democracy & Apna country
 - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 13, 2019 There have been ups and downs between Aamir Khan and Narendra Modi
 15 april 2006 ko aamir ne jantar mantar par pradarshan kar raheen activist medha patekar kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Medha was opposing a decision of the Gujarat government at that time, stating that the length of Sardar Sarovar Dam would be increased
 us dauraan aamir kii film rang de basanti release hone vaali thi or ve apni puri team ke saath medha kaa samarthan karne pahunche the
 Many were surprised to see Aamir's activism in the Narmada Bachao Andolan
 isse pehle aamir ne saal 2002 main gujarat dangon ke liye modi kii aalochana kii thi
 He had said that as a Chief Minister, Modi could not control the situation
 sainkadon logon ko apni jaan ganvaani padi
 Apparently, this statement of Aamir passed on to the Gujarat government and his film Fana in 2006 was unofficially banned in Gujarat
 iske alaava 2007 main ai unki film taare jameen par ko bhi gujarat main kaaphi virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Aamir had made it clear that he was not opposed to the construction of the Narmada dam but wanted the government to make necessary arrangements for the rehabilitation of those who had to lose their land due to the construction of this dam
 unhone ye bhi kaha tha ki ve kisi se maafee nahin maangenge kyonki unhen apni baat rakhane kaa haq he

 saal 2014 main modi ke piem banane ke ek maheene ke bheetar aamir khan ne unase mulaakaat kii or is mulaakaat kii tasveeron ko soshal media par share bhi kiya
 He also spoke about supporting the pm's ambitious project Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 iske baad saal 2015 main apane vivaadit bayaan ke baad aamir khan kai logon ke nishane par aa gaye the
 After the NDA government came to power, there were many incidents of intolerance in the country
 isi ko lekar aamir khan ne bayaan diya tha ki desh ke philhal jaise halaat hai, meri patni ke mutabik ve bahut sef feel nahin kar rahi hai
 He faced tremendous opposition on this statement of Aamir
 soshal media par aamir ke dwaara pramot kiye ja rahe brand snapdil ko bhi iskaa dansh jhelana padaa
 However, on the completion of 10 years of the film Rang De Basanti, he made it clear that his statement was misinterpreted and people raised the issue more than necessary and he also said that some parts of the media twisted his statement

 unhone saaf kiya tha ki hamaare desh kii khubsuurati hi anekta main ekta he

 ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki aamir or modi ke rishte main loksabhaa chunaav ke baad kya badlaav aaenge
 Taking a dig at the party's claim of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi being a 'janeudhari Hindu', bjp's Rajya Sabha MP Dr
 subramanyam swami ne kaha ki 47 saal ke gandhi ke vanshaj ko apane pita kii antyeshti ke liye janeu dhaaran karnaa padaa tha
 Along with this, Swamy termed the Congress party as 'one family's dharamshala' and said that it does not matter if he becomes a president
 bataa den ki rahul gandhi ne congress party adhyaksh pad ke liye somvaar ko namakan patr bharaa he or is par unke rnivirodh chune jane kii puri ummid he
 On the question of Rahul Gandhi being a Hindu, Swamy told the media that he had to forcibly wear a jewelery from outside or else he could not attend his father's funeral
 swami ne rahul ke bare main kaha ki jab vah yah sweekaar karte hai ki vah shivbhakt hai, to unhen yah manjuur karne main kya pareshaani he ki vah ek hindu hai? aap kehete ho mandir jaataa hum, shivbhakt hum, phir aapkaa sahyogisomnath mandirmen gaiyr hindu register main unka naam bharta he
 That register has to be sought
 uske sahaayak ne register mangaya tha or pujari ko bataaya tha ki do gaiyr hindooon kaa naam likhnaa he
 Tell me what is the truth aap hindu hai yaa nahin
 All the controversy could be over in a minute
 dharm ke nijee vishay hone ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki dekhiye, jhooth bolnaa dharm nahin he
 You said that i am a Shiva devotee and said in the register that i am a manger
 aapane kaha maine nahin bharaa register, sahaayak ne bharaa
 He has also signed you
 bijepi netaa ne daawa ki ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan jald hi shuru hoga or agle saal ham deepawali ayodhya ke ramamandir main hi manaayenge
 He said that i have seen what our arguments are and there is no power in the logic of the opponent
 elahabaad hai court main vah haar gaye hai, ab apil main aae hai, lekin koi nai baat nahin rakhi he isaliye main maanata hum ki adaalat main hamaara jeetna nishchat he
 In response to a question, Swamy said that bjp's victory in Gujarat is certain
 sharaab kaarobaari vijay maalya ko desh main waapas laane ke sawaal par swami ne kaha ki sarkaar lagi hui he, kisi ko chhodeygi nahin
 On GST, Swamy said that after the new tax structure is implemented, now the GDP of the country is slowly starting to increase
 isi tarah notebandi ke baad sabane kaha tha ki isse bijepi ko nuksaan hoga, lekin iske baad hue uttar pradesh kevidhansabha chunavonmen bijepi kii baari vijay hui

 Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat arrived in Sikkim on Thursday
 army chif yahaan border aria kaa daura karenge or halaat kii samiksha karenge
 This visit is important because China's Dadagiri has been exposed on the Sikkim border for the last two days
 kailash maansarovar kii yatra china ne roak di he
 The pilgrims have returned from the border
 border par tanaav ke bahaane china pichley do din se bharat ko dhamka rahaa he
 Although the visit of the army chief was pre-decided, but it has become very important in the current situation of tension along the border with China
 general bipin ravat sikkim border par forward post par jaaenge or senior cmanders ke saath suraksha ke halaat kii samiksha karenge
 Bunker broke with bulldozer Earlier on Wednesday, there was news once again that China removed an old Indian Army bunker on its border with India and Bhutan using bulldozer
 jaankaree ke mutabik bhartiya bunker hataae jane kii ghatana june ke pehle saptaah main sikkim ke doka laa ilaake main hui jisase sikkim kshetra main bharat-china seemaa par tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 india-china have a border of 3,488 km from jammu-kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh
 isamen se 220 kilometre sikkim main aata he
 According to reports, China forcibly removed the old bunker using heavy machinery like bulldozers when India was not ready on China's request to remove it
 maansarovar yatra rokeeisse pehle china ke videsh mantralay ne aarope lagaaya tha ki sikkim main border ko paar karke bharat ke jawan uske ilaake main aae hai
 China's Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Defense called it an infiltration of Indian soldiers and asked them to retreat
 isi kii vajah se china ne kailash maansarovar kii yatra ko bhi roak diya, or pehle batch ke 50 bharatiyon ko waapas lautaa diya
 China's Foreign Ministry said that it will not allow the Manasarovar Yatra to take place until the Indian troops withdraw
 bharat hi nahin, bhutan se bhi china kaa vivadchin ke sarkari akhbaar global times ne likhaa ki jis bhi tareeke se bharat ko niyamon kaa sabak sikhaanaa pade, sikhaanaa chahie
 Now China broke an old Indian Army bunker on the Sikkim border, saying that India does not believe it
 sikkim border kii wo jagah he, jahaan donglong main china ek sadak bana rahaa he, us parabharat ne aapatti jataithi, kyonki jis ilaake main china sadak bana rahaa he, wo bharat ke saath saath bhutan ke bhi ilaake main aati he
 This is the area connected with the border of Sikkim, where China has a dispute not only with India but also with Bhutan
 2008 main bhi tode the bankerchin kaa kahana he ki uskaa sadak bananaa sahi he kyonki ye ilaaka naa bharat kaa he or naa hi bhutan kaa he
 China, citing the Treaty of British rule of 1890, has declared the area near Sikkim border as its own
 yahaan tak ki china ne kaha ki is 127 saal puraani sandhi ke mutabik sikkim kaa pracheen naam jhi he or jis ilaake main sadak banane par bharat etraj jataa rahaa he, wo ilaake kii seemaa ko lekar koi vivaad nahin rahaa he
 But the truth is that on the Sikkim border, China has been showing bigotry before, even in 2008, it had broken the army bunkers
 tibet se sikkam or bhutan ko jodne vaale border par china lagaataar sadaken banane or zamin kabja karne kii koshishen karata rahaa he
 China burnt with indo-us friendship, this time this issue has come to light when the friendship between India and America has been updated afresh
 baraak obama ke baad trump ke raaj vaale america se bharat ke rishte kaise honge, ye bhi clear ho chukaa he, jisase pakistan ko sidhe taur par or china ko sanketon main kootneeti kaa alert mil gaya he ki aane vaale dinon main usko har manamaani karne kii chhot nahin milegi
 Perhaps this is the reason why China’s heart has been jealous of the true friendship between India and America

 Farmers with government employees, income tax and pension of 15,000 will also be kept away from this scheme

 Vizianagaram Lok Sabha seat of Andhra Pradesh is located in the north of the state
 yah ek nai loksabhaa seat he, jiskaa gathan sansadeey nirvachan kshetron kaa parisemen lagu hone ke baad 2008 main hua
 Therefore, this seat has been able to hold two Lok Sabha elections so far, in which once the Congress and once the TDP, the party in power in the state, won
 2008 se pehle vijiangaram kshetra main congress kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 However, the Congress has lost its grip here since the TDP came into existence
 vahiin is seat par abhinayta chiranjeevi dwaara gathit praja rajyam party (piarpy) kaa bhi prabhaav he
 From an economic point of view, it is considered to be a rich region due to the seaside
 vijiangaram jile main bandargah hone ke kaaran yah vyapaar kaa ek bada centre he
 On one side is the sea area, while on two other sides it is surrounded by Araku and Visakhapatnam
 2014 se pehle is kshetra main alag telugana kii maang ko lekar kaaphi pradarshan hue the
 In 2014, Gajapati won by 1 lakh votes
 In 2014, TDP leader Gajapati Raju won this seat by a margin of more than one lakh votes
 lekin is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main unke liye chunauti badi he kyonki 2014 kii jeet main kai kaarak unke saath the
 He had the support of Narendra Modi wave BJP which is not there this time
 saath hi pradesh main bhi badlaav kii lahar thi
 But this time tdp's separation from NDA has increased their problem
 2014 ke aam chunaav main vijiangaram seat par tidipi ummidavaar ashok gajpati raju ne jeet kaa paracham laharaaya tha
 He received nearly 48 percent of the vote
 vahiin, 2009 main is seat par jeet hasil karne vaali congress khisak kar tisare number chali gai thi
 Congress candidate Jhansi Lakshmi received 1,22,487 votes
 is seat par wiesar congress ke ummidaar venkat sujay krishna rangarav ravu ko 4
 29 lakh votes were received
 unhen tidipi ke haathon 1 lakh voton ke antar se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Rangarao was earlier in the Congress but joined YSRCP in 2012
 isse pehle congress main rahete hue rangarav ne 2004 or 2009 main vidhansabha chunaav ladaa or jeet hasil kii
 According to the Election Commission, there are more women voters than men in this seat
 1658 poling stesan vaale is loksabhaa kshetra main kul 14 lakh 3,736 voter hai, jisamen 7 lakh 736 purush or 7 lakh 2,984 mahila voter hai
 a total of 80 on this seat in the 2014 general elections
 19 fisadi voting hui thi
 Out of which TDP is the highest at 47
 89 fisadi vot mili the
 At the same time, YSR Congress candidate 38
 35 fisadi or congress ummidavaar ko mahaj 10
 9 percent votes were received
 7 vidhansabha main se 5 par tidipi kaa kabjasat vidhansabha siton vaale vijiangaram loksabhaa main tidipi kaa kaaphi dabadabaa he
 This can be gauged from the fact that out of the 7 Legislative Assemblies in this Lok Sabha, five hold TDP
 vahiin, do par wiesar kabiz he
 According to the current situation, the Congress is in danger of its existence on this seat
 vijiangaram main atcherala, chipurupalli, gajpatingaram, nellimarla or vijiangaram vidhansabha seat par tidipi ke vidhayak hai
 Apart from this, the Rajam assembly seat reserved for Bobbili and SC is in YSR Congress account
 gajpati ne apane kshetra main vikaas kaaryon ke liye saansad nidhi main se 24 karod rupee kharch kar chuke hai
 Gajapati Raju's presence in Parliament has been insignificant despite being a former cabinet minister only once in 40 years of politics
 unhone mahaj 12 bahason main hissaa liya or is dauraan ek bhi sawaal nahin poocha
 Ashok Gajapati Raju has a long association with politics
 vah kareeb pichley 40 saalon se raajnneeti main sakriy hai
 Gajapati's dominance has always been in the House, whether in the Legislative Assembly or in the Lok Sabha
 chunaav jeetne kaa hunar gajpati se behatar shaayad hi kisi ko aata ho
 TDP leader Gajapati, who entered politics in 1982, has so far won 7 Assembly and one Lok Sabha elections
 gajpati ne 1978 main janata party kii taraf se vijiangaram vidhansabha seat par chunaav ladaa or jitkar vidhansabha pahunche
 He then joined the Telugu Desam Party formed in 1982
 tidipi kii taraf se unhone 1983, 1985, 1989, 1994 or 1999 main lagaataar chunaav jitkar vidhansabha pahunchate rahe
 However, he faced defeat in the 2004 assembly elections but in 2009 he contested again and won
 is dauraan wo 1983 se lekar 2004 tak rajya cabinet main vibhinn mantralayon kii jimmedaari sanbhali
 Given his sincerity towards the party and his election-winning potential, the TDP contested the 2014 general election from Vizianagaram seat
 jiske baad gajpati ne apane virdohi wiesar ummidavaar ko ek lakh se bhi zyada voton ke antar se haraaya or loksabhaa pahunche

 The SP has said to take action after investigating the case
 duusari taraf ladke ke ghar ke log kah rahe hai ki ladki jhooth bol rahi he or yah bayaan usne tab kyon nahin diya jab vah dilli se lauti thi

 aksar gambhir or shant rahane vaale pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bijepi saansad virendra singh mast ne khub thahaake lagavaaye
 The matter was that when BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh Virender Singh Mast was speaking in the discussion on the motion of thanks on President's address in Lok Sabha
 thik usee samay pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi sadan main maujuud the
 Virendra Singh Mast compared the road shows of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi Gandhi to the shooting of a film and said that people see him like a shooting and they miss singing a song after seeing the road show like this
 rajesh khanna or mumtaj par filmaae gane- 'donon kisi ko najar nahin aae,chal dariyaa main dub jaaen
 The mp's style was such that before connecting Akhilesh and Rahul Kerod Shoko with this song, Virender Singh Mast created a lot of atmosphere in the house and said that he does not watch movies, he did not watch movies even in college time
 sadan main baithi hema malini ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki hema ji bura mat maniega vah filmon ke khilaaf nahin he
 But he has not seen movies
 uske baad mast ne akhilesh yadav or rahul gandhi ke road sho ko is gane se jodate hue jaise hi chutki lee sadan main baithe pradhanmantri sahit tamaam saansad thahaake lagane lage
 While Virender Singh Mastabol had been on the motion of thanks to the President's address, the election of Uttar Pradesh was settled on his mind and heart
 jo unke lachchhedaar bhaashan main najar bhi aa rahaa tha
 After taking a pinch on rahul-akhilesh's roadshow, Mast once again hit out at Rahul, saying that nowadays the issues of farming and farmers are being raised by people who have no idea of farming and farmers nor wheat, Barley, know the difference of tide
 virendra singh mast yaheen nahin ruke unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa gungan karte hue kaha ki vah desh ke logon kii prerana hai
 People look at them

 Salman Khan's 'ek Tha Tiger' has been such a hit, it can be easily gauged from the fact that its collection was more than Rs 20 crores on Eid day, and the film will be a business of 100 crores
 In the list of films, it was ranked as the film to do so in the shortest days
 
 
 film kaarobaar ke jaankaron ke anusaar buudhvaar tak 'ek tha tiger' kaa collection behatar hi rahegaa
 
 
 According to Komal Nahata, he feels that in the coming days, 'ek Tha Tiger' will surpass the business figures of Salman Khan's 'dabangg' and 'bodyguard' so far
 
 
 nahata ke mutabik 'ek tha tiger' na sirf 150 karod rupee kaa collection aasaani se kar legi, balki yahi alam rahaa to vah 200 karod kaa aankada paar kar aamir khan kii superhit film 'thri idiyats' kii barabari bhi kar sakati he
 
 
 The comments ullekhneey he ki yah salmaan khan kii varsh 2009 ke baad lagaataar paanchavin hit film he, jabaki inamen se chaar filmon 'dabang', 'ready', 'bodyguard' or ab 'ek tha tiger' ne 100 karod kaa aankada paar kar liya he, haalanki varsh 2009 main ai or jabardast hit rahi 'wonted' is aankade ko nahin chhu pai thi
 
 
 These five hit films have so far crossed the Rs 600 crore turnover mark overall, and the amount seems to be only increasing at the moment
 
 
 lekin sabase dilachasp baat yah he ki salmaan khan rukne vaale nahin hai, or vah abhi se agali id kii taiyaari main jute hai
 
 
 It is believed that he wants to release his brother Sohail Khan's production house 'sherkhan' on the next Eid
 
 
 to aaie, intazaar karte hai, yah sochate hue ki jab 'tiger' ne yah kamaal kiya he, to 'sher' kya dhamal karegaa

 According to film business experts, the collection of 'ek Tha Tiger' will be better till Wednesday
 
 
 komal nahata ke mutabik unhen lagata he ki aane vaale dinon main 'ek tha tiger' salmaan khan kii hi 'dabang' or 'bodyguard' ke ab tak kiye kaarobaar ke aankade ko paar kar legi
 
 
 According to Nahata, 'ek Tha Tiger' will not only make a collection of Rs 150 crores easily, but if it stays the same, then it can also surpass Aamir Khan's super hit film 'three Idiots' by crossing 200 crores
 
 
 tippaniyan It is noteworthy that this is Salman Khan's fifth consecutive hit film since 2009, while four of these films 'dabangg', 'ready', 'bodyguard' and now 'ek Tha Tiger' have crossed the 100 crore mark, However, 'wanted', which came in 2009 and became a huge hit, could not touch this figure
 
 
 in paanch hit filmon ne ab tak kul milakar 600 karod rupee ke kaarobaar kaa aankada paar kar liya he, or yah rakam philhal sirf badhati hi dikhaai de rahi he
 
 
 But the most interesting thing is that Salman Khan is not going to stop, and he is already preparing for the next Eid
 
 
 mana ja rahaa he ki vah apane bhai sohail khan ke production house main ban rahi khud kii film 'sherkhan' ko agali id par release karnaa chaahate hai
 
 
 So come, let's wait, thinking that when 'tiger' has done this awesome, what will the 'lion' do
 
 
 ullekhneey he ki yah salmaan khan kii varsh 2009 ke baad lagaataar paanchavin hit film he, jabaki inamen se chaar filmon 'dabang', 'ready', 'bodyguard' or ab 'ek tha tiger' ne 100 karod kaa aankada paar kar liya he, haalanki varsh 2009 main ai or jabardast hit rahi 'wonted' is aankade ko nahin chhu pai thi

 Bidita Bag's tweeting did not stop here and he tweeted another

 a post shared by SAPNA CHOUDHARY (@isapnachaudhary_) on Sep 23, 2018 at 2:22pm PDTA post shared by sapna choudhary fc (@sapna_ka_sapna_) on Oct 11, 2018 at 8:41pm PDT The BJP has termed the break-up of its 17-year-old alliance with JDU as unfortunate and tragic
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa or varisht bijepi netaa sushamaa swaraj ne micro bloging website twitor par twit kiya, endie kaa tootna dukhad or durbhagyapurna he
 The comments gauratlab he ki bijepi ke goa sammelan main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko bijepi ke chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa adhyaksh banaae jane or isse jude ghatnakram ke baad aaj jediu ne endie se alag hone kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa kar di
 JDU president Sharad Yadav resigned from the post of NDA convenor and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recommended to the Governor to remove BJP ministers
 nitish ne kaha, bijepi nae daur se guzar rahi he
 We do not agree with that
 ham apane buniyadi usulon se samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 Nitish Kumar wanted the BJP to announce that Narendra Modi would not be made the prime ministerial candidate
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ke goa sammelan main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko bijepi ke chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa adhyaksh banaae jane or isse jude ghatnakram ke baad aaj jediu ne endie se alag hone kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa kar di
 JDU president Sharad Yadav resigned from the post of NDA convenor and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recommended to the Governor to remove BJP ministers
 nitish ne kaha, bijepi nae daur se guzar rahi he
 We do not agree with that
 ham apane buniyadi usulon se samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 Nitish Kumar wanted the BJP to announce that Narendra Modi would not be made the prime ministerial candidate
 jediu adhyaksh sharad yadav ne endie ke sanyojak pad se istipha de diya or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke mantriyon ko hataane ke liye rajyapal se sifarish kar di
 Nitish said, BJP is going through a new phase
 ham usase sahamat nahin hai
 We cannot compromise our basic principles
 nitish kumaar chaahate the ki bijepi yah ghoshnaa kare ki narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar nahin banaaya jayega
 The Bharatiya Janata Party is at this time putting all its strength into promoting Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial contender
 modi jahaan jate hai, jo bolte hai, vah surkhiyon main aa jaataa he
 What Modi, his political disciple Amit Shah has also emerged as a provider of better news material after becoming in charge of Uttar Pradesh
 lekin thande dimag se dekha jaae to modi ke is ubhaar ne bijepi ko vivaadon ke alaava kya diya he
 He may have been the head of the election campaign committee a month ago, but his name has been floating in the air for a long time
 or isi daur main bijepi uttarakhand kii satta congress ke haath kho baithi
 After this, the BJP sunset in Himachal too
 karnataka main modi ne khub prachaar kiya lekin nateeja vahi niklaa jiskaa pehle se andaja tha
 The BJP government formed for the first time in a southern state lost the election badly and the command fell to the Congress
 party ko apane pairon par khadaa karne vaale laalkrishna adwani or modi ke bich kadavaahat is had tak badi kii bujurg netaa ne apane pad se istipha de diya
 Later, after the Manaval of the Sangh, Advani agreed but for the first time in the history of the BJP and the Sangh, the Sangh looked so political
 sangh pramukh ne bijepi or adwani kaa prem kaa dhaagaa jod to diya, lekin isamen padi ganth nagpur ke doctor mitaa nahin sake
 And the biggest setback was for the party in Bihar, where its over a decade and a half relationship with JDU broke down in a jolt
 isi daur-daura main bijepi ne jharkhand kii apni sarkaar bhi ganvaa di
 The more the BJP continues to move about Modi, the more its land is slipping
 udhar anginat ghotaalon ke manake apane kanthhaar main sajaa chuki upie-do sarkaar chale hi ja rahi he
 Before any of his colleagues are angry, Congress prepares a new ally
 congress kaa ravaiya dekhne main raajnneetik saudebaaji lag saktaa he, lekin vah kaamyaab to ho hi rahi he
 First went to Mamta, then Karunanidhi
 or jab laga ki congress kii naiya dol rahi he to dhur virdohi sapa or bispi ek saath uske saath aa gaye
 Now, when the SP eyes are on the Congress, jdu's Sanjivani is present with the Congress
 jediu se congress kii galabahiyon ko sirf vakt kii baat kahana ninsaphi hogi
 Actually this is part of the far-reaching strategy of Congress
 congress shuru se is pher main thi ki ek na ek din secularism kaa patta chalegaa or jediu bijepi se tauba karegi
 If this was not the case, the Congress would not let Lalu Prasad Yadav, who had sacrificed his life, join the UPA 2 despite a million attempts, while Ajit Singh, who holds one seat more than the RJD, is the civil aviation minister at the center
 agar sab kuch isi raftaar par chalata he to jald hi jharkhand main jhamumo kii sarkaar congress ke sahyog se khadi ho jaaegi or badale main congress ko loksabhaa ke liye rajya main 10 siton par ladgaye kaa haq mil jayega
 That is, the Congress is proceeding silently on its strategy
 ain chunaav se pehle khaadya suraksha adhyadesh laakar congress ne apni ranneetik tadap ko ujagar kar diya he
 The most interesting thing is that the BJP has weakened the memory of the Congress scandals from the minds of the people by making a mockery of Modi
 or bich-bich main hone vaale raghavji jaise prakaran bijepi kii museebataan badhaane vaale hi sabit honge
 If the Congress is hoping to win in silence, then the BJP is considering Modi's hunk as a victory
 ab tak kii baaji main congress aage he
 But tomorrow's net worth is not necessarily determined by today's situation
 kyonki agar aisa hota to sarkarein banane ke liye chunaav karaane kii jarurat hi nahin hoti
 Anyway, even if the government falls in talk, no one has seen it being formed

 mahapandit rahul sankrutyaayan kii jayanti par isi sankalan kii pehali kahani'volga se ganga' kii pehali kahani 'nisha'kaal : 6000 isa purvadopaher kaa samay he, aaj kitne hi dinon ke baad surya kaa darshan hua
 Although there is no sharpness in its glory in this five-hour day, yet the rays of the sun spreading around at this time, devoid of clouds, snow, fog and thunderstorms bring delight to the mind by touching and touching
 chaaron ore kaa drishy? saghan nil-nabh ke neeche prithvi karpur-si shwet him se aachhadit he
 Due to no snowfall for twenty four hours, the snow has hardened despite being grainy
 yah himavasana dharti digant-vyaapt nahin he, balki yah uttar se dakshin kii ore kuch mile lambi rupahali tedi-medhi rekha kii bhanti chali gai he, jiske donon kinaaron kii pahadiyon par kaali vanapankti he
 Come, take a closer look at this vegetation
 usamen do tarah ke vriksh hi adhik hai- ek shwet-balkaladhari, kintu aajkal nishpatr bhurj (bhojaptr); or duusare atyant saral uktung
 Extruded branches at right angles, unbroken or Krishna-less needle-leaf cedar
 vrikshon kaa kitna hi bhaag him se dhakaa hua he, unki shakhaon or skandhon par jahaan-tahaan rukii hui barf unhen krishna-shwet bana aankhon ko apni ore khinchati he
 And ? Bhayavani is the unbroken state of silence
 kahin se na jhilli kii jhankaar aati he, na pakshiyon kaa colorav, na kisi pashu kaa hi shabd
 Come, climb the cedar of the highest place of the hill and look around
 shaayad vahaan barf, dharti, deodara ke atirikt bhi kuch dikhaai pade
 Do big trees grow here? Does this land not have space for small plants and grasses? But we cannot give any opinion about it
 ham jaade ke do bhaagon ko parkar antim bhaag main hai
 The snow in which these trees are buried, how thick it is, we have no means to measure it
 ho saktaa he, vah aath haath yaa usase bhi adhik moti ho
 Everyone is complaining of snow this year
 deodara ke upar se kya dikhalaai padataa he ? vahi barf, vahi vanapankti, vahi unchi-nichi pahari bhoomi
 Yes, on the other side of the hill, smoke is rising
 is praani-shabd-shunya aranyani main dhooma kaa uthanaa kautuhal-janak he
 Come on, remove your curiosity there
 dhuaan bahut dur tha, kintu svachh nirabhr akaash main vah hamen bahut sameep maaloom hota tha
 We have now come close to him
 hamaari naak main aag main padi hui charbi tathaa maance kii gandh aa rahi he
 And now words are also being heard, these are the words of small children
 hamen chupchaap pairon tathaa saans kii bhi aahat na dekar chalanaa hoga, nahin to ve jaan jaayenge, or phir na jane kis tarah kaa swaagat ve khud yaa unke kute karenge
 Yes, there are really small children, the eldest is not more than eight years old, and the younger one is one year old
 aadhe darjan ladke or ek ghar main
 Not home, this is a natural mountain-cavity, whose sides and back have gone to the darkness, we are not seeing it, and should not try to see it! And grown man? An old man whose foggy white hair is tangled and scattered in the form of pots in such a way that his mouth is covered in them
 abhi budhiya ne haath se apane kesh ko hataaya
 His eyebrows are also white, wrinkles are on his white face, which seems to be coming out from all inside the mouth
 guha ke bheetar aag kaa dhuaan or garmi bhi he, khaskar jahaan bachche or hamaari daadi hai
 No clothes, no cover on grandmother's body
 uske donon sookhe-se haath pairon ke paas dharti par pade hue hai
 His eyes are penetrated inside, and the dull blue mannequins are minuscule, but he jumps in between them, which shows that his light has not gone away at all
 kaan to bilkul chaukanne maaloom hote hai
 Grandma seems to be listening well to the boys' voices
 abhi ek baccha chillaaya, uski aankh idhar ghumi
 Baras-deh- Baras has two children, one boy and one girl, both equal in height
 donon ke kesh jaraa-sa peelaapan liye safed hai, budhiya kii bhantih kintu zyada chamkile, zyada sajiv
 His body is athletic, Arun Gaur, his eyes are huge, the pupils densely blue
 ladkaa chilla ro rahaa he, ladki khadi ek choti haddi ko munh main daale chus rahi he
 The grandmother said in a stunned voice - "agin! Come
" yahan aa agin ! daadi yahan
 "agin was not getting up
 us samay ek aath baras ke ladke ne aakar use god main le daadi ke paas pahunchaaya
 The hair of this boy is also pandu-white from that of a small child, but he is taller, he has more braided hair
 uske apad nagn sharir kaa varna bhi vaisaa hi gaur he
 But he is not that much a master; And black scum is wrapped in it
 bade ladke ne chote bachche ko daadi ke paas khadaa kar kaha-"daadi ! rochana ne haddi chhini
 Cries the fire 
 The boy left
 daadi ne apane sookhe haathon se agin ko uthaaya
 He was still crying
 uske aansuon kii bahati dhara ne uske maile capolon par moti arun rekha khinch di thi
 Grandma kissed Agin's mouth and said- "agin! Don't cry rochana ko maarthi hoon"- or ek haath ko nangi, kintu varshon ke charbi se sikt farsh par pataka
 The "high" of the fire was still not closed; No more tears were closed
 daadi ne apni maili hatheli se aansuon ko ponchhate hue agin ke capolon kii arun pankti ko kaala bana diya
 Then in order to recreate the weeping fire, she put the tanned breasts hanging like a litter's dry betiya in the midst of the rags inside the dried leather
 agin ne stan ko munh main daalaa, usne ronaa band kar diya
 At the same time, the voice of conversation started coming from outside
 usne shushk stan se munh khinchakar upar jhaankaa
 Someone's sweet melodious voice came - "agin"
 agin phir ro uthaa
 Two men (women) slammed the bundle of wood on the head in one corner
 phir ek rochana ke paas or duusari agin ke paas bhaag gayi
 Agin said more "mommy-mom"
 maan ne daahine haath ko swatantra rakhte hue daahine stan ke upar saahi ke cotte-se gunthe safed bail ke sarom chamade ko kholkar neeche rakhaa
 Due to the winters of the winter, there was less flesh on his young body, yet he had extraordinary beauty
 uske laal mile-chhute kapol kii arun-shwet chhavi, lalaat ko bachaate bikhare hue lat-viheen pandu-shwet kesh, alp-maansal prithul vaksh par gol-gol shyaamal-mukh stan, anudar krush-kati, pusht madhyam pariman nitamb, peshipurn bartrul jangha, shramdhavan-parichit halaakaar penduli
 That Ashtadashi Taruni lifted Agin in both hands and kissed his face, eyes and cupola
 agin ronaa bhul chukaa tha
 White teeth were shining out of his red lips, his eyes were semi-printed, there were small pits in his cheeks
 neeche gire vrishabh-charm par taruni baith gai or usne agin ke munh main apane komal stanon ko de diya
 Agin started drinking the breast with both his hands
 isi samay duusari nagn taruni bhi rochana ko liye paas aakar baith gai
 It was known from their faces that they were both sisters

 In the cavity we see them coming out leaving the conversation
 barf par chamade se dhanke bahut se pair ek disha kii ore ja rahe hai
 Let's move quickly while holding them
 abhi vah pad-pankti tirchhi ho paar vaali pahari ke jangal main pahaunchi
 We are growing by running fast, but the fresh line-line is not coming to an end
 ham kabhi shwet himashetra main chalate hai, kabhi jangalon main hi pahari kii ridh ko paar kar duusare himashetradusre parvaty van ko laanghate hue badhate hai
 Finally, we looked down at the spine of a treeless hill
 vahaan neeche se uthati shwet himrashi nil nabh se mil rahi he, or us nil nabh main apane ko ankit karti hui kitni hi maanav-murtiyan parvat-prishth kii aad main lupt ho rahi hai
 If there was no blue sky behind them, surely we would not have seen them
 unke sharir par him jaisaa shwet vrish-charm he
 The arms in their hands also appear to be colored in white
 phir mahan shwet himashetra main unki hilti-dulti murtiyon ko bhi kaise pahachaanaa ja saktaa he?or paas chalakar dekhen
 At the forefront is a woman of a strong body
 aayu chalis or pachaas ke bich hogi
 Only by looking at her open right arm, it is known that she is a very strong woman
 uske kesh, chehre, ang-pratyang guha kii purvokt donon taruniyon ke samaan, kintu bade aakaar ke hai
 In his left hand is a thick pointed wood of three hands long bhurj
 daahine main chamade kii rassi se lakdi ke bent main bandhaa ghiskar tej kiya hua pashaan-parashu he
 He is followed by four men and two women
 ek mard kii aayu stri se kuch adhik hogi, shesh chhbbees se chaudaa varsh ke hai
 The hair of a big man is also very big and pandu-white
 uskaa munh usee rang kii ghani dadhi-munch se dhanka hua he
 Her body is also like a woman; He has two similar arms in his hands
 baaki teen mardon main do usee tarah kii ghani dadhi-moochon vaale, kintu umr main kam hai
 Among women, one is twenty two, the other is less than sixteen
 ham guha ke chehron ko dekh chuke hai or daadi ko bhi, sabko milaane se saaf maaloom hota he ki in sabhi stri-purushon kaa rup daadi ke saanche main dhalaa hua he
 These male and female handcuffs of wood, bone and stone weapons and their serious efforts show that they are going on a campaign
 pahari se neeche utar kar aguva stri - maan kahiye - bain ore ghumi; sabhi chupchaap uske peeche chal rahe hai
 While walking on the snow, there is no word from the leather on their bunched feet
 ab aage kii ore lataki hui (prag bhaar, pahaad) badi chattan he, jisaki bagal main kai chattaane padi hui hai
 The poachers have slowed down their pace
 ve teetar-bitar hokar bahut sajag ho gayi hai
 They are moving forward after touching all the legs for a long time, lifting the other leg behind one leg, touching the rocks with their hands
 maan sabase pehle guha ke dwaar-khulaav-par pahaunchi
 She looks carefully at the white snow outside, there is no sign of any kind
 phir vah akele guha main ghusati he
 When a few hands move, the cavity rotates, there is little light
 thodi der thahar kar vah apni aankhon ko abhyast banaati he, phir aage badhati he
 There are three brown bears - mother, father, child - sleeping on the earth with their mouth down, or dead - there is no sign of life in them
 maan dhire se laut ai
 The family understood the emotion after seeing his blossoming face
 maan anguthe se kani angulii ko dabaakar teen anguliyon ko failaakar dikhaati he
 After the mother, the two men carry the arms forward, the others wait while holding their breath
 bheetar jaakar maan bhaaluu ke paas jaakar khadi hoti he
 The elder one is near Bhaluni and the other near the child
 phir ve apane nokdaar danda ko ek saath aise jor se maarthe hai, ki vah kokh main ghuskar kaleje main pahunch jaataa he
 There is no movement
 jaade kii chah-maasi nidra ke tuutane main abhi maheene se adhik kii der he, kintu maan or parivaar ko iskaa kya pataa ? unhen to satark rahakar hi kaam karnaa hoga
 Penetrating the tip of the pole three or four times and into the stomach, they reverse the bear, then fearlessly grab their front legs and mouth and drag them out
 sabhi khush ho hanste or jor-jor se bolte hai
 Reversing the big bear, the mother took out a flint knife from her leather sheet, then blew from the place of the wound and ripped the leather of the stomach - with such a clean knife with a stone knife, the leather would not work and strong hands is
 usne naram kaleji kaa ek tukdaa katkar apane munh main daalaa, doosraa sabase chote chaudaa varsh ke ladke ke munh main
 Everyone else sat around the bear, mother was giving everyone a piece of Kaliji
 ek bhaaluu ke baad jab maan ne duusare bhaaluu par haath lagaaya, us vakt shodashi taruni baahar gai
 He put a nugget of ice in his mouth, at that moment the elder man also came out
 usne bhi ek dale ko munh main daal shodashi ke haath ko pakad liya
 She hesitated just a little
 purush use apni bhujaa main band ek ore le gaya
 When Shodashi and the man held a large nugget of ice in their hands, both had more redness in their cheeks and eyes
 purush ne kaha- "mai katata hoon, maan ! tu thak gai he
 Mother gave the knife to the man's hand
 usne jhukkar choubees varsh ke tarun ke munh ko choomaa, phir uskaa haath pakadakar baahar chali gai
 He ate a kaleji of three bears
 chaar maas ke niraahaar soye bhaaluon main charbi kahan se rahegi, haan bachche bhaaluu kaa maance kuch adhik narm or suswaadu tha, jisamen se bhi kitna hi unhone kha daalaa
 Then everyone lay down to rest for a while
 ab unhen ghar lautnaa tha
 Male and female bears were raised by two men each with leather ropes tied on the shoulder with the help of the poles and the young bear with a taruni
 maan apana pashaan-parashu sanbhale aage-aage chal rahi thi
 Those wild humans did not know the hour and hour of the day, but they knew that it would be moonlight night today
 thodaa hi chalane ke baad surya kshitij ke neeche chalaa gaya jaan padataa tha, kintu vah gaharaai main nahin gaya, isiilie sandhyaa-raag ghanton bana rahaa, or jab vah mitaa tab dharti, ambar sarvatra shwetima kaa raaj ho gaya
 Now the house-cavity was away, while in an open place, mother suddenly stood up and started listening to something
 sab log chupchaap khadey ho gayi
 Shodashi went to Tarun for six months and said- "gurr, Gurr, Vrk, Vrk (wolf)"
 maan ne bhi upar-neeche sir hilaate hue kaha 
 
 
 
 
 
 "gurr, gurr, vruk
 Very Lupine, Lupine
 " phir uttejnapurna swar main kaha- "taiyaar"shikaar jameen par rakh diya gaya, or sab apane-apane hathiyaaron ko sanbhaale ek-duusare se pithe sataakar chaaron ore munh kiye khadey ho gayi
 In talk, the fluffy tongues of the flock of seven-eight wolves began to appear and they came roaring and circling around them
 maanvon ke haath main lakdi ke bhaale or pashaan-parashu dekh ve hamalaa karne main hichkicha rahe the
 At the same time, the boy - who was in the middle of the circle, prepared a command by taking out a wood tied in his pole, and tied a thin rope of leather tied at the waist, and then did not know where to remove the hidden sharp stone-fruit arrow
 He held it in his hand and stood in his place himself
 choubise purush ne pratyancha ko or ksaa, phir tanakar tankaar ke saath baan chhod ek bhediye kii kokh main maaraa
 The wolf rolled, but after resting, while the man was preparing for an indiscriminate attack, the man released the second arrow
 abaki bhediye ko ghaav karaara laga tha
 Seeing him dead, other wolves reached him
 pehle unhone uske sharir se nikalate hue garam khun ko chata
 Then they cut it and started eating
 unhen khaane main vyast dekh, phir logon ne shikaar uthaaya or satarkta ke saath daudte hue aage badhanaa shuru kiya
 This time, Mother was behind, and used to look around in the middle
 aaj barf nahin padi thi, isliye unke pairon ke chihn chandani raat main raste ko acchhee tarah batala sakate the
 The cavity must have been less than half a mile away that the flock of wolves reached again
 unhone shikaar ko phir jameen par rakh hathiyaaron ko sanbhaala
 This time the archer had fired many arrows, but he could not do anything for the wolves who could not stay in one place even for a moment
 kitni hi der ke pantarebaaji ke baad chaar bhediye ek shodashi taruni ke upar tut pade
 The mother standing beside slammed her spear into the ground of a wolf and slammed it on the ground, but the other three fell down in the thigh of Shodashi, and in the talk, ripped her stomach and threw the knuckles out
 jis vakt sabakaa dhyaan shodashi ko bachaane main laga tha, usee vakt duusare teen ne peeche se khaali paa choubise purush par hamalaa kiya or bachaav kaa mauka jaraa bhi diye bina jameen par patake kar uski bhi lad faad di
 As long as people paid attention there, he had dragged twenty five hands away to Shodashi
 maan ne dekha, choubisa purush adhamare bhediye ke paas dam tod rahaa he
 Someone put a stick in the mouth of a half-wolf, someone grabbed his next two legs, then the rest drank the wolf's hot salty blood, Mother made his work easier by cutting the pulse of the throat
 
 yah sab kaam chand minuton main hua tha, log jaanate the ki shodashi kii tukka boti kar chukne ke baad hi bhediye ham par akraman karenge
 They left the dead twenty-four men there and started running, picking up three bears and dead wolves, and they reached the cavity safely
 aag dhaany-dhaany jal rahi thi, jisaki laal roshni main sabhi bachche tathaa donon taruniyan so rahi thim
 Dadi shivered as soon as she shouted but said in a serious voice - "nisha! Has she come?" Saying "yes", the mother first put the arms aside, then she opened the leather dress and became Digambari
 shikaar ko rakh usee tarah baaki sabane bhi charm-paridhaan ko hataa aag ke sukhmay ushn sparsh ko rome-rome main vyaapt hone diya
 Now the whole soy family was awake
 
 These people are addicted to childhood only to wake up on a slight sound
 bahut sanbhaal kar kharch karte hue maan ne parivaar kaa ab tak nirvaah karaayaa tha
 Reindeer, rabbits, cows, sheep, goats, horse-hunting stop before winter starts, because at the same time they go out towards the hot state of the south
 maan ke parivaar ko bhi kuch or dakshin janaa chahie tha, kintu shodashi usee vakt biimaar pad gai
 According to the human religion of that time, it was the duty of the mother of the family to not endanger the life of the whole family for one
 kintu, maan ke dil ne kamajori dikhalaai
 Today he had to lose one, two
 abhi shikaron ke lautne main do maheene hai, is bich main dekhen or kitnon ko dena hota he
 His bear cannot be cut into three bears and a wolf
 bachche bade khush the, bechaare khaali pet lete hue the
 Mother first cut them off with a wolf
 ladke hap-hap kar kha rahe the
 leather without damaging it 
 chamade kaa bada kaam he
 When the meat was cut and given, many hungry people ate only something raw, then everyone started frying on the fire embers
 apane bhune tukdon main se ek gaal kaatane ke liye maan kii sabhi khushmad kar rahe the
 Mother said- "just eat today, don't get much from tomorrow
" "maan uthakar guha ke ek kone main gai, vahaan se chamade kii phuli hui jhilli ko laakar kaha- "bas yahi madhu-sura he, aaj piyo, naacho, krida karo
 "the little ones got to drink by grunting from the membrane, the elders got more
 nasha chadh aayaa
 Eyes turned red
 phir hansee kaa tahaakaa shuru hua
 Someone sang
 bade purush ne lakdi se lakdi bajaani shuru kii
 People started dancing
 aaj vastutah anand kii raat thi
 Mother had a kingdom, but it was not a state of injustice and inequality
 budhi daadi or bade purush ko chhod baaki sabhi maan kii santaanen thim, or budhi ke hi bada purush tathaa maan betaa-beti the, isliye vahaan meraa-tera kaa prashn nahin ho saktaa tha
 In fact, the era of mera-tera was still late
 kintu haan, maan ko sabhi purushon par samaan or pratham adhikaar tha
 She is not sorry for the loss of her twenty-four sons and husband; But the life of that time was more concerned about the present than the past
 maan ke do pati maujuud the
 The third fourteen year-old was getting ready
 uske rajya ke rahete-rahete bacchon main se bhi na jane kitne pati kii avasthaa tak pahunch sakate the
 Mother liked Chhabisse, so only one Pachasa man was left for the remaining three girls
 jaada bitate-bitate daadi ek din sadaa ke liye soi padi mili! bacchon main se teen ko bhediye le gayi or bada purush barf pighalane par umadi nadi ke pravaah main chalaa gaya
 In this way, the family was reduced to nine instead of sixteen
 3
 Those were the days of spring
 chirmrit prakruti main navajivan kaa sanchaar ho rahaa tha
 For six months, two leaves were coming out on the dry bhurj-trees
 barf pighali, dharti hariyaali se dhankati ja rahi thi
 The wet alcoholic smell of vegetation and new soil was spreading in the air
 jivan-hin digant sajiv ho rahaa tha
 Somewhere on the trees the birds were hearing the sweet words of the people, somewhere the membrane was making a continuous noise, somewhere the thousands of water birds sitting on the banks of the snowy currents were engaged in worms-eating, the geese were laughing
 
 ab in hare parvaty wanon main kahin jhund ke jhund hiran kudate hue charate dikhalaai padate the, kahin bheden, kahin bakriyaan, kahin barasinghe, kahi gaayen
 And somewhere the leopard was sitting in their ambush, and somewhere the wolf
 jaade ke liye avaruddh nadi ke pravaah kii bhanti ek jagah ruk gaye maanav-parivaar bhi ab pravaahit hone lage the apane hathiyaaron, apane chamadon tathaa apane bacchon ko laade grih-agni ko sanbhaale ab ve khuli jagahon main ja rahe the
 As the days passed, like the flora and fauna, thicker levels of meat and fat were accumulating under their dry skin
 kabhi unke lambe kesh vaale bade-bade kute bhed yaa bakrii pakadte, kabhi ve swayan jaal, baan yaa lakdi ke bhaale se kisi jantu ko maarthe
 There were also fish in the rivers, and the nets of the inhabitants of the upper part of this Volga would never come out empty yesterday
 raat main ab bhi sardi thi, kintu din garm tha, or nisha-parivaar (maan kaa naam nisha) aajkal kai duusare pariwaron ke saath volga ke tat par padaa hua tha
 Like Nisha, other families were ruled by their mothers and not by their fathers
 vastutah vahaan kiskaa pita koun he, yah batalaana asambhav tha
 Nisha was born to eight daughters and six sons, with four girls and three sons still present at the age of fifty-five
 inke nisha-santaan hone main sandeh nahin, kyonki iske liye prasav kaa sakshya maujuud he; kintu unka baap koun he, ise bataanaa sambhav nahin he
 Before Nisha, when her mother - old grandmother - ruled, then old grandmother - at that time, there were so many brothers and husbands of old men - how many times she danced with Nisha, singing and becoming a character of his love
 Was successful, then did not dare to reject Nisha's constantly changing love interest when she became queen herself
 isiilie nisha kii jivit saaton santanon main kiskaa koun baap he, yah kahana asambhav he
 He is also the eldest elder and sovereignty in Nisha's family today; Although this sovereignty is not going to last long
 varsh-do varsh main vah swayan budhi daadi banane vaali he, or tab sabase balishtha nisha-putree lekha kaa rajya hone vaala he
 At that time, the sisters of Lekha would definitely quarrel with him
 jahaan har saal parivaar ke kuch aadamiyon ko bhediye yaa chitah ke jabadon, bhaaluu ke panjon, bail ke singon, volga kii baadhon kii bhent chadhana he, vahaan parivaar ko ksheen hone se bachaana har rani mata kaa kartavya he
 Even then it has happened, one or two of the sisters of accounting will definitely be able to establish independent families
 yah parivaar-vruddhi tabhi rukati, yadi anek veery ke ek kshetra hone kii bhanti anek raj kaa bhi ek veery-kshetra hota
 The family's owner Nisha sees her daughter Lekha very successful in hunting
 vah pahadiyon par harinon kii bhanti chadh jaati he
 On that day, a big honey bee appeared on a rock, in a very high place, where even the bear (madhvad) could not eat it
 lekin, lekha ne latthe par latthe baandhe, phir chhipakali kii bhoti sarakate raat ko usne mashaal se chhatey ko vifailli badi-badi madhu-mackhiyon ko jalaakar usamen chhed kar diya
 No less than thirty seers of honey would have fallen in the lower leather coats
 lekha ke is saahas kii tarif sara nisha-parivaar hi nahin, padosi-parivaar bhi kar rahaa tha
 But Nisha was not satisfied with that
 vah dekh rahi thi, tarun nisha-putr jitna lekha ke ishaare par naachne ke liye taiyaar he, utana uski prarthana ko sunanaa nahin chaahate, yadhyapi ve abhi nisha kii khullam-khulla avagya karne kaa saahas nahin rakhte
 Nisha had been thinking of a way for so many days
 kabhi use khyaal hota lekha ko sote main galaa dabaa kar maar den, kintu vah yah bhi jaanati thi ki lekha usase adhik balishtha he; vah akeli uskaa kuch bhi nahin bigaad sakati
 If he wants to seek the help of another, then why would anyone help him? All the men in the family wanted to become accountant, kind-hearted
 nisha kii putriyaan bhi maan kaa haath bantaane ke liye taiyaar na thim, ve lekha se darati thim
 She knew that failing would take her life badly
 nisha ekaant main baithi kuch soch rahi thi
 Suddenly, his face blossomed - he had some idea of defeating accounting
 pahar bhar din chadh aayaa tha
 All the families lay naked or sitting in sunlight behind their leather tents, but Nisha was sitting in front of the tent, with a three-year-old son playing with her
 nisha ke haath main done main laal-laal strawberry ke fal the
 The stream of Volga was flowing from nearby, and there was sloping ground up to Arrar standing directly in front of Nisha
 nisha ne ek fal ludhkaaya
 The boy ran and caught him and ate him
 phir duusare ko ludhkaaya; use thodaa or aage jane par vah pakad sakaa
 How quickly Nisha rolled the fruit; The child hurried to catch them so much that once his foot slipped from the arrow and he fell from the Dhamma to the sharp edge of the Volga
 nisha volga kii ore najar daudaaye cheekh uthi
 Lekha saw something sitting at a distance
 putr ko na dekh vah dhar kii ore jhapati
 His son was still going up and down in Dhar
 usne chalaang maari or putr ko pakad lene main safal ho gai
 The child was relaxed after drinking too much water
 volga kaa barfila jal sharir main kaante kii tarah chubh rahaa tha
 The account was difficult to cut and move towards the edge
 uske ek haath main baccha tha, duusare haath or pairon se vah tairne kii koshish kar rahi thi
 At the same time, he saw his throat stuck in someone's strong hands
 lekha ko ab samajhane main der na lagi
 She had been watching Nisha's changed mind of late
 aaj nisha apane raah ke is kaante-lekha-ko nikaalnaa chaahati he
 Accounts could still show Nisha her strength; But he had a child in his hand
 nisha ne lekha ko jor lagaate dekh apni chaati ko uske sir par rakh diya
 Accounts drowned once
 chatapataane main uskaa baccha haath se chhot gaya
 Even now Nisha kept her uncontrollable
 ekaek uskaa haath nisha ke gale main pad gaya
 Lekha was unconscious and Nisha unable to swim with her burden
 usne kuch koshish kii, kintu bekaar! donon ek saath volga kii bhent hui
 Rochana Nisha - The family's strong woman became the mistress of the family
 [ aaj se 361 peedi pehle kii katha he

 The result was taken seriously by the bank and it certainly benefited the bank

 pakistani gidadbhabhaki kaa bharat ne diya karaara javabavidesh mantralay ne kaha- maahaul naa bigaaden imran ke mantribelistic missile gaznavi ke pareekshan ke bich pakistani gidadbhabhaki kaa bharat ne karaara jawaab diya he
 The Ministry of External Affairs has stated clearly that the leaders of Pakistan should not try to spoil the atmosphere
 bataa den ki pakistan jammu evam kashmir ko mili vishesh darje ko samaapt karne ke bharat ke faisle se kaaphi pareshaan he
 This is the reason why Pakistan's leaders are constantly making provocative statements about Jammu and Kashmir
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki bharat ke aantarik maamalon par pakistani netaaon ke haalia bayanon kii ham kadi ninda karte hai
 These are very irresponsible statements
 unhone kaha ki pakistan ke mantri shaikh rashid kaa bayaan maahaul ko kharaab karne kii koshish main diya gaya he
 Please tell that on Wednesday, Sheikh Rashid said that the time has come for the final struggle for independence of Kashmir and this time the war with India will be final
 'raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki duniya ke saamne pakistan tanaavpurn halaat dikhaanaa chahta he
 But the world understands Pakistan's move
 duniya jaanati he pakistan maahaul kharaab kar rahaa he
 Statements made by Pakistan regarding Jammu and Kashmir are an interference in our case
 hamaari suraksha agenciyaan halaat se nipatane main sakasham hai
 He said that not a single shot was fired in Jammu and Kashmir after 5 August
 police kii karrwai main ghati main kisi kii jaan nahin gai
 85% of police station areas are without any data restriction
 aspataal main dawaaon kii kami ko lekar afvaahen failaane kii koshish kii gai lekin aavashyak dawa kii kami nahin thi
 Slow and positive improvements are now being seen
 yah puche jane par ki kya pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye hawaii kshetra ko pakistan ne band kiya he
 In response, he said that no statement has come from Pakistan confirming the closure of the airspace
 gujarat main aatanki hamale ke alert par baat karte hue MEA raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki ham sabhi jaanate hai ki pakistan ne aatankwaad ko apni niti ke rup main apanaaya
 He has been helping terrorism and terrorist groups to flourish from his land
 ham ummid karte hai ki wo aatank ke khilaaf karrwai karegaa or ek acha padosi banegaa
 We hope that Pakistan will follow the international norms and obligation
 gaznavi missile par PAK kaa gumaan, in 4 hathiyaaron se tod degaa hindustanfaishi dwaara bhartee ko lekar india today kii taraf se kiye gaye sting par videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki sting ke bare main kuch nahin bol saktaa, lekin haa, pakistan ab jo kar rahaa he wo sabake saamne he
 Good neighbors do not spread terror
 pakistan bharat ko pareshaan karne ke liye aatank kaa sahaara le rahaa he
 Pakistan is doing all this so that the world feels that something is happening
 yahi kaaran he ki pakistani netaaon kii taraf se abhi tak 40-50 bhadakaau bayaan aa chuke hai

 '' saraswati ne yah bhi kaha, ''doctoron ke mutabik jayalalita akhbaar padhane lagi hai or teji se swasth ho rahi hai

 lekin modi ke bhavishya ke saamne ishrat jahaan kaa 9 saal purana farji encounter maamla aa khadaa hua he
 Though only 7 policemen are named in the cbi's charge sheet, but it can reach Narendra Modi and his most loved character Amit Shah in a hurry
 sawaal modi par bhi uth rahe hai kyonki jis vakt ishrat jahaan kaa encounter hua tha, us vakt gujarat kaa grih mantralay bhi mukhyamantri narendra modi ke paas hi tha
 While his most trusted aide was the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Amit Shah, whom Modi has appointed as bjp's in-charge of Uttar Pradesh these days
 ab sawaal he ki kya apane hi pulisavaalon ke itane sangeen maamle kii koi bhi bhanak sarkaar ko nahin thi
 And if it was not, then why was there no attempt to conduct a fair investigation in the case at the beginning
 jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he
 Questions are also being raised on Modi because the CBI claims that there is evidence of Modi and Amit Shah's information
 sibiai ye sabit karne main juty he ki ye muthbhed farji thi auki isaki jaankaree mukhyamantri narendra modi or unke kareebi amit shah ko pehle se thi
 The CBI claims that they also have some police witnesses who have the recording in which DIG Vanzara told IB officer Rajendra Kumar in gestures that Modi and Amit Shah were fully aware of the encounter

 If the Congress has surrounded Narendra Modi for calling Ishrat's encounter fake, then the BJP has also hit back at the Congress
 sibiai ne ishrat jahaan encounter ko farji bataaya to congress ne gujarat sarkaar par hamalaa bol diya
 The Congress attack on Modi was swift even though Gujarat's CM Narendra Modi was not named
 udhar, palatwaar karne main bijepi ne bhi der nahin kii
 The central government was on the target of BJP

 Virat has scored 9919 runs in 204 innings of 212 odis so far
 philhal yah record sachin tendulkar (259 paariyaan )ke naam par he
 Kohli will become a batsman to complete 4,000 ODI runs in India as soon as he scores 30 runs in this sequence
 baat ab tisare record kii, kohli ne 2018 main ab tak 10 maichon main 889 ran banaae hai
 If he is successful in scoring 111 runs, then he will achieve the feat of reaching the 1000 run mark in the year

 com / zfpu3fn3h4 — BCCI (@BCCI) October 22, 2018 Kohli currently ranks fourth in terms of scoring the most runs in odis in the year 2018
 england ke teen khilaadi johny beresto (1025 ran, 22 vanade), jo root (936 ran, 23 vanade) or jesan roy (890 ran, 21 vanade) is maamle main pehle teen sthaan par hai
 Virat may be fourth in terms of scoring runs in odis but it has to be kept in mind that he has played almost half the matches this year compared to all three England batsmen
 tippaniyan Former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (MS Dhoni), who is under criticism due to his batting at the moment, can also make a big achievement
 dhoni ne ab tak vanade international main bharat kii ore se khelte hue 9949 ran banaae hai or unhen team india kii ore se khelte hue vanade main 10,000 ran puure karne ke liye 51 ran kii darkaar he
 Significantly, Mahi scored 174 runs in three matches against Africa XI, playing for Asia XI in 2007, which made him join the 'dus Hazari' club during the recently concluded Asia Cup but for India They still need 51 runs to complete 10,000 runs in odis
 openar yani shikhar dhawan (shikhar Dhawan) yani 'jatji' ke paas bhi is match main vanade cricket main paanch hazaar ran puure karne kaa mauka hoga
 Shikhar Dhawan currently holds 48 in 111 matches
 27 kii ausat se 4827 ran bana hai
 Dhawan now needs 173 runs to complete five thousand runs in ODI cricket
 dhawan guwahati main hue vanade main flop rahe the lekin asia cap main balle se jabardast pradarshan karte hue ve main of da toornament rahe the
 This left-handed opener may not reach this record in the Visakhapatnam ODI but it will probably achieve this feat in the five-match ODI series

 In the age when children should have toys and books in their hands, at that age, if someone puts the goods of death in those hands, then what would you call it? Today, in the case of innocent people who are learning to play with bullets and guns in the Al Qaeda terror factory
 al kaayda ne apni is factory kaa jo video jari kiya he, use dekh kar duniya sakate main he
 These pictures startle, make Rongte stand out
 ye tasviren sochane par majaboor karti hai
 Because this is not a battleground, but the latest picture of the factory of the world's most dangerous terrorist organization al-qaeda
 ye tasviir us factory kii he, jisamen jehadi or maanav bam taiyaar hote hai, lekin is baar is factory ne apni branding ke liye jo video jari kiya he, wo ab tak kii tamaam tasveeron se do kadam aage bad kar he
 Because in this video, such small and innocent children are shown taking dangerous weapons training, who do not even understand the worldliness, yet do not even follow their steps properly
 pakistan or afghanistan ke border par ye wo gunmaan thikaana he, jahaan par dur-dur tak khamoshi he or ye sannata tabhi tuutata he, jab aatank kii is factory main asalhe aag ugalate hai
 It is clear that Al Qaeda has brainwashed these children in the name of Jihad
 lekin aakhir ye bachche hai koun? inke maa-baap koun hai? ye kahaan se aate hai? or itane kam umr main inhen aise khatarnaak hathiyaar thamane kaa makasad kya he? in sawaalon ke jawaab hairaan karne vaale hai
 The latest video of al-qaeda is the biggest evidence of how humans can go mad in the name of Jihad
 al-kaayda kii is aatank factory main ye maasoom automatic pistal se fyring ke gur sikh rahe hai
 The child shown is still very young
 umr hogi sirf 5 saal
 And at this very young age, it is enough to put this item of death in someone's hand
 jab wo baccha pehla fire karata he or trigar dabaate hi pistal ke jatke se hill jaataa he
 On the first stroke, he is able to manage somehow, but his balance of the second shock also worsens his balance
 yahaan keval ek nahin, kai bachche is tarah khatarnaak hathiyaar chalaanaa sikhte dikhaae gaye hai
 The video itself has been shot by terrorists in an al-qaeda hideout along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan
 lekin aatank kii is factory kaa sabase chaunkaane vaala sach ye he ki maut ke munh main jhonke gaye ye takreeban sabhi ke sabhi maasoom yateem hai
 These children of terrorists killed in military and police action have been brought back again by al-qaeda on the same path on which their fathers were killed
 jaahir he, aatank kii is factory main insaan or insaaniyat kii koi jagah nahin
