 Hardly anyone had issued such an absurd decree before
 sanakee taanashaah kim jong un chah may ko aadhikarik rup se uttar korea ke raashtra adhyaksh ke taur par khud kii tajposhi karaane ja rahaa he
 During this coronation ceremony, there was no obstruction, just because he issued an order
 hukum ye ki ek hafte tak uttar korea kii rajdhani pyongyang main na koi shaadi hogi, na koi antim sanskaar or na hi koi matam manegaa
 Only then will the eccentric Sultan's happiness of refreshment
 ji haa, yahi hukum he us sanakee sultan kaa jisaki sanak ke kisse philhal puri duniya main sune or sunaae ja rahe hai
 This is the latest craze for North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un
 is farmaan kaa saaf matlab he ki ek haftaa na yahaan koi apane hisaab se khushi manaa saktaa he or na hi matam
 Four years ago, he took over the throne of North Korea
 beete chaar saal main usne uttar korea ke sarvocch netaa ke taur par apana dabadabaa kaayam bhi kar liya
 But now officially he wants to crown himself
 36 saal baad ho rahaa tajposhi kaa kaarykramdarasal uttar korea kii sattadhari workars party of korea ne chah may ko rajdhani pyongyang main ek sammelan bulaayaa he
 Such a conference is taking place after 36 years
 isse pehle 1980 main kim jong un ke pita kii tajposhi ke liye itnaa bada samaaroh hua tha
 Kim Jong Un will be officially crowned as the North Korean ruler at the May 6 ceremony
 is tajposhi samaaroh main shaamil hone ke liye hajaaron dailygats uttar korea kii rajdhani pyongyang pahunchane vaale hai
 There will be no disturbances in the lock-and-greet ceremony in the lock, just because Kim Jong-un ordered to tighten the security of the entire capital so that the common man will remain imprisoned in the houses for a week on the road
 rajdhani ke har ghar kii talaashi lee ja rahi he or sabhi ko hukum diya gaya he ki ek khaas vakt par sab apane gharon main taala laga kar rahen
 The Army has already locked the places where there was little doubt
 na hogi shaadi, na antim sanskaar, na hi manegaa matamsamaroh ke dauraan koi gadabadi na ho jaae isliye chah may tak rajdhani main hone vaali tamaam shaadiyon or antim sanskaar par bhi roak laga di gai he
 Even though the date of the wedding was pushed forward by people, the problem is with those who died in their homes
 ab na to chah may tak wo unka antim sanskaar kar sakate hai or na hi ji bhar ke ro sakate hai kyonki tajposhi ke dauraan matam par manaahi he
 On suspicion, according to people already in jail, during the coronation, Kim Jong is going to declare North Korea a nuclear armed nation
 is tajposhi main kisi tarah kii koi baadha na aae iske liye usne un tamaam logon ko pehle hi bandhak banaakar jail main daal diya he jinpar use jaraa sa bhi shaq tha
 Death to Hundreds, Millions of Hostages Since taking over power in 2011, Kim Jong has killed more than 200 of his political opponents and nearly 200 leaders and officers who have challenged power
 kehete hai ki uttar korea main maujuud camp or alag-alag jelon main lagbhag 2 lakh logon ko bandhak bana kar rakhaa gaya he
 Thirty thousand hostages suddenly disappeared from one of these camps
 unki talash aaj bhi jari he
 According to a report of the Manavadhakir Commission, which came in 2013, one lakh 20 thousand leaders have been kept in different jails during Kim Jong Un's tenure so far
 bhukh se mar rahe hai logakhabar he ki tajposhi samaaroh ke liye karodon rupye kharch kiye ja rahe hai or duusari taraf ek afsosna sachai ye he ki usee uttar korea ke hajaaron log bhukh kii vajah se dam tod chuke hai
 For the last four years, since Kim Jong Un has taken the throne, only bombs and guns have been his hobby
 usne hydrone bam to bana liya par apane hi logon kaa pet nahin bhar paa rahaa he
 Alam is that people are eating their way in some way by eating grass
 bacchon ko markar khaane ko majaboor logauttar korea kii haalat ab kuch itani bhayanak he ki kuch ilaakon se to logon ke apane hi bacchon ko maar kar khaane tak kii kachotane vaali khabaren saamne ai hai
 According to this news published in the Sunday Times, quoting Asia Press, a person ate his own grandson's body due to hunger in North Korea
 kai shaharon or kasbaai ilaakon main logon ke apane khaane ke liye ghaas ukhaad kar le jane kii tasviren bhi saamne ai hai
 According to a rough estimate, in recent times only 10,000 people have died in North Korea due to hunger and famine
 porn film dekhne par maut kii sajaadesh main log bhukhe mar rahe hai magar use america ko dhamkee dene main mazaa aata he
 It is fun to make bombs
 kim jong un ke paagalpan kii kahaniyaan sun kar koi bhi hairaan ho saktaa he
 Would you believe that North Korea is such a country even in this era where even the use of mobile is banned? Yes, this is true
 lekin uttar korea main taanaashaahee kii bas yahi ek misaal nahin balki yahaan bible padhanaa yaa porn movie dekhne par sidhe maut kii sajaa he
 Even foreigners cannot use mobiles In this era of information revolution, every other day when something new, new gadget is reducing the size of the world, North Korea has banned the use of Mboil itself
 yahaan videshon se ghoomane aane vaale sailaaniyon tak ko apane saath mobile phone laane or uskaa istemaal karne kii ijaajat nahin he
 If someone brings a mobile here, the security personnel keep it with them beforehand and on return, their mobile phone is returned to them
 bible padhane par milti he mautahairaani ye bhi ki yahaan marijuana jaisi cheez tak ko drugs nahin mana jaataa or uske istemaal karne kii aazaadee he, jabaki bible padhanaa itnaa bada gunaah he ki aise karte hue pakade jane par maut milti he
 Wearing jeans here is also a crime and taking a picture of a poor person is a bigger crime than that because Kim Jong believes that by taking a picture of the poor or keeping it somewhere, the image of the country is tarnished
 sirf ek hi rang se ghar hote hai paintlekin taanaashaahee kaa isse bada subut kya hoga ki uttar korea kaa koi bhi naagarik 8 july or 17 disambar ko khushiyaan khaas kar apni berth de nahin manaa saktaa kyonki 8 july ko desh ke pehle shaasha kim il sung kii maut hui thi, jabaki 17 disambar ko kim jong un ke pita kim jong il kii
 Another proof of dictatorship is that nobody here can get their house painted on their own
 balki kim jong un kii ore se tay kiye gaye grey color se hi saare logon ko apana ghar rangana padataa he
 Kim Jong is a ruthless dictator who can go to any extent
 kehete hai wo ab tak hajaaron logon ko maut ke ghat utarava chukaa he
 The people of his country are forced to suffer because Kim does not tolerate rebellion
 vah virodh kii aawaaj ko sakhti se dabaa detaa he
 It also had its relatives beheaded by hunting dogs
 jo log us par jaan chhidakte hai, un par bhi uskaa julmo-sitam chalata rahata he
 People are forced to make military America has imposed many restrictions on Kim's country
 america sarkaar uttar korea ko exis of evills yani shaitan kii dhuree kahati he, lekin kim jong-un kii sehat par shaayad hi iskaa kabhi asar padaa ho
 Due to constant tension with South Korea and America, there are always war-like situations here
 isliye apni sainya takat badhaane ke liye ye taanashaah har ghar se logon ko jabardastee sena main shaamil karwaane kaa aadesh detaa he
 Not only this, to increase the strength of the army, girls also forcefully make soldiers
 sabakuch kim karata he taysirf 32 saal kii umr main use narth korea kii gaddi mili or jin rishtedaaron ne use gaddi par bithaane laayak banaaya usne sabase pehle unheen apano kii jaan le lee
 They are not like that either by blowing with cannon or by putting them in front of hungry dogs
 uski hukumat main aam logon ko car rakhane yaa car main chalane kii ijaajat nahin he
 The hair style in his country is the same as his hair
 shahar ke gharon kaa rang bhi vahi tay karata he
 It made headlines in April last year before the hydrogen bomb test when it blew up its own Defense Minister with a cannon just because he had fallen asleep during a meeting
 isame apane hi foofa ko nanga kar sau bhukhe kutton ke aage isliye phenk diya tha kyonki wo isaki kursi ke liye khatra ban gaya tha
 In this country, if a foreign TV channel, foreign films or foreign songs are heard, it hangs it and sets its house on fire
 iske mulk main aam log car se nahin chal sakate
 This right belongs only to the ministers and officers of the Ministry of Defense
 iske mulk main iske baalo kaa style hi sabake baalo kaa fishan mana jaataa he
 According to the strange actions, North Korea's army chief Hyon Yong Joel took a light nap in an army meeting
 bas unki isi khata ke liye 66 saal ke hyaan ko saikadon logon kii moujdugi main 30 april ko ek sainya prashikshan range main vimanbhedi top se uda diya gaya
 Hyan was sentenced to death three days after his arrest
 upar se kamaal dekhie ki top se sharir ke chithde uda dene ke baad kim ne unka antim sanskaar puure rajkeey sammaan se karaayaa
 Kim is passionately fond of looking like her grandfather
 kehete hai ki ki usne apane dada kii shakl kii chaah main apane chehre or sharir ke kai cosmetic oparation karwaae hai
 So he does not reduce his weight either
 kim ko ghudsawaari kaa jabardast shauk he lekin shart yahi he ki jis vakt wo ghudsawaari kare, koi or ghudsawaari karata na dikhaai de varanaa wo usko goli se marava detaa he

 About two months before the Rajasthan assembly elections, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has put a stop to such speculation that she has differences with BJP national president Amit Shah

 Explain that this year there were reports of differences between Vasundhara Raje and Amit Shah regarding the appointment of bjp's Rajasthan President
 is niyukti par antim muhar lagane main do maheene kaa vakt laga tha kyonki raaje ne is pad ke liye amit shah kii pasand kendriya mantri gajendra singh shekhavat ko maanane se inkaar kar diya tha
 However, they later agreed to make Madan Lal Saini the new BJP president of the state
 vasundhara raaje se jab poocha gaya ki surveykshanon main rajya sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko lekar logon ke naakhush hone kii baat kahi ja rahi he to mukhyamantri ne puure aatmavishvaas se kaha, ‘do maheene intjaar kiijie, main waapas aauungi
 We will win
 survey myne nahin rakhte
 My government will return to its work
 mukhyamantri ne jor dekar kaha, ‘kisi main khadaa hone kaa saahas nahin or jo audit ke liye kahe
 i have that courage because we have shown it
 main puure rajya main ghumi hum or sabhi yojanaon kaa jayja liya he
 We have documented everything with all plans
 log maan rahe hai ki unhen inase laabh ho rahaa he’

 wo pichley saadhe chaar saal se kahaan the
 They have come out in the last 3-4 months only

" mere paas karne ko bahut se kaam hai
 i am not accountable to journalists
 main logon ko javabdeh hum’
 The Chief Minister praised the unprecedented achievements made by women in the state in their respective fields
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘vakt badal gaya he
 Women are now walking shoulder-to-shoulder with men
 sabase ahm cheez shiksha he
 In response to the question of how difficult it was for him to make a place for himself in politics, Vasundhara Raje said, 'I have the privilege of being born in the royal family, but never had the feeling of man-woman or woman-man
 mujhe kaam karne kaa mauka mila or dhire-dhire vishwaas badhata chalaa gaya
 Explaining the difference between the first and second term as Chief Minister, Vasundhara Raje said, 'when you start anything, you learn
 aisi kai baaten hai jo maine sikhi hai, wo bhi kam-se-kam avadhi main
 i have implemented them
 unhen achche istemaal main lagaaya he
 When addressed as "maharani", Vasundhara Raje said, "it hurts
" rajpariwaar ne logon ke vikaas ke liye bahut yogadan diya he
 That is why the 'feudalists' won elections for so many years
 saamanti sahi myne main koi boj nahin he
 In the true sense of feudalism, i never saw my parents sitting empty
 unhone hameshaa logon kii madad kii or unka logon ke saath majboot sampark tha’

 The issue of sealing in the national capital Delhi is becoming a sore throat for the BJP
 jahaan vyapaaree is mudde ko lekar sthaayee samaadhaan ke paksh main he, to vahiin didie ke prastaav ko lekar supreme court se lekar visheshegya tak gambhir chintaa jataa rahe hai
 Their concern is that Delhi may not become a slum in the process of giving relief to traders

 While the DDA is trying to give relief to the traders by bringing the proposal, there are questions about the proposal
 didie ke toun planar rahe arady gupta ne bhi is par sawaal daage hai
 They have asked whether the DDA wants to make Delhi a slum? In fact, in the DDA proposal that there is a dispute over increasing the FR, Delhi is facing the same congestion and parking problem
 isko lekar court bhididieko latad laga chukaa he
 In the national capital Delhi, this problem can become even more serious and Delhi will be turned into a slum by repeated discounts
 ab sawaal yah he ki commercial ilaakon main parking kaa praavdhaan kaise lagu ho paaegaa? parking bazaar ke andar hogi, to vahaan ke halaat bigadenge
 Hence parking should be away from the markets
 vahiin, duusari ore bijepi visheshgyon par hi sawaal khadey kar rahi he
 The question is that if the FAR (floor area ratio) is increased, what will be the diagnosis of the problem arising from it? Even though there is talk of providing relief on sealing, but experts also believe that parking and illegal buildings will not be banned, then problems will arise and Delhi will turn into a slum

 Significantly, Rohit Sharma has been doing well in odis for some time now, but he is still waiting for his Test debut

 According to the news published in the newspaper, Dhoni said that he gives the list to the selectors according to his choice but the selectors choose the team of their choice and their talk is ignored

 He said- It was the Congress government and it was its three-time chief minister Tarun Gogoi who protested and raised the minimum wages of those working in tea gardens
 unhone kaha ki 'har koi jaanata he' ki modi sarkaar ne assam ko kaise deal kiya
 Sonia Gandhi said that PM Modi refused to give food to Assam when Assam was facing floods
 unhone yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki upie sarkaar dwaara assam ko diya gaya special states bhi modi sarkaar ne waapas le liya

Last week, PM Narendra Modi said during the election campaign that Gogoi is 90 years old and Assam needs a relatively young leader

 Senior JDU leader and former minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said that bjp's defeat in Bihar assembly elections in 2005 and 2010 did not benefit JDU because of BJP, but BJP took advantage of Nitish Kumar's popularity and credibility
 
 choudhary ne aarope lagaaya ki is chunaav main bhaajapa ne teen dalon se ghoshit taur par or do partiyon se aghoshit taur par samjhauta kiya lekin bihar kii janata ne unki sabhi ‘sajishon’ or ‘hawabaji’ ko nakaar diya or is chunaav main modi kaa karishmai vyaktitv bhi use nahin ubaar saki
 Chaudhary said that since the last two years when JDU broke with the BJP, till the recently concluded Bihar assembly elections, all the provincial and central leaders of BJP including Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been trying to show that BJP is Nitish Kumar
 Made him the chief minister and it was his sacrifice that made him a leader
 choudhary ne kaha ki jadyu kii ore se baar-baar spasht kiya gaya ki yah nitish kumaar kii lokapriyata or vishwasaneeyata thi jiske aadhaar par bhaajapa ko bhi phayda hua or use 90 se adhik siten (varsh 2010 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav) main milin
 The BJP was not ready to accept this
 tippaniyan Chaudhary said that its examination was held in Bihar Assembly Elections 2015 and Nitish Kumar is once again forming the government with an overwhelming majority with new allies on the strength of his omnipotent and reliable personality
 unhone kaha ki bihar vidhansabha chunaav 2015 ke parinaam se bhaajapa ko pataa chal gaya hoga ki nitish kumaar ke bagaiyr uski kya takat he
 He said that after this election the BJP must have realized that Nitish Kumar had become the Chief Minister because of him that the strength of BJP and the number of mlas had increased due to Nitish
 choudhary ne kaha ki pichley do saalon se jab se jadyu ne bhaajapa se naata todaa, tab se haal main sampann bihar vidhansabha chunaav tak pradhanmantri narendra modi samet bhaajapa ke sabhi prantiy or kendriya netaa yah jataane kii koshish karte rahe hai ki bhaajapa ne hi nitish kumaar ko mukhyamantri banaaya or yah uskaa tyaag tha jo unhen netaa maan liya
 Chaudhary said that it was repeatedly clarified by the JDU that it was Nitish Kumar's popularity and credibility on the basis of which the BJP also benefited and got more than 90 seats (bihar Assembly elections 2010)
 ise maanane ko bhaajapa taiyaar nahin thi
 The comments choudhary ne kaha ki isaki pariksha bihar vidhansabha chunaav 2015 main ho gayi or nitish kumaar apane sarvamaanya or vishwasaneey vyaktitv ke bal par nae sahyogiyon ke saath ek baar phir baari bahumat se sarkaar bana rahe hai
 He said that with the result of Bihar Assembly Election 2015, the BJP would have known what its strength is without Nitish Kumar
 unhone kaha ki is chunaav ke baad bhaajapa ko ahsaas ho gaya hoga ki nitish kumaar unke kaaran mukhyamantri bane the ki bhaajapa kii takat or vidhayakon kii sankhya nitish ke kaaran badi thi

 The danger started with a variety of lies that were spreading on their shoulders, digging into the sky

 If these markets cannot save crooked politics and freedom to speak falsely, then their business is closed

 The General Budget and the Railway Budget strengthen our faith in Parliament, that is why everyone is busy listening to the budget on tv-radio on the budget day, on other days they also know what is going on inside
 bajet main aam aadmi kaa dhyaan sirf is baat par hota he ki sasta kya-kya hone vaala he, bajet se hamaari ummiden hoti he
 Bathing red soap may become cheaper or yellow yellow lentils become cheaper, while the opposition taking Jamuhai is just looking at when to be discharged and can go out and say 'budget disappointing'
 kabhi gaharaai se poocha jaae to pataa lagegaa bajet kaa wo hissaa niraashajanak tha jab mej kii thapthapaahat se unki neend tut gai
 Rail budget will come again on Thursday, some new trains, some changed routes, reduced fares and announcements will also come and go, but the real problems of train passengers will remain there
 aam aadmi kii ummiido par jo rail bajet khara utre use kuch aisa hona chahie jisamen nai suvidhaayen bhale kam hon par kuch sudhaar jarur ho jaae
 1
 plateform par khadi train main shauchalay kaa prayog na karen
 This warning is written in the toilet of every train, but to use the same facility in a moving train, since childhood, it is necessary to have the skill of walking on a moving rope of nuts, the railway minister must pay attention to this
 2
 Railways earn from passenger fares, freight earnings, but more than that for seven to seven years in the name of operation of ulcers in the same train, those who ask for donations and apprehensive by clapping
 railway agar unki kamai kaa bhi kuch hissaa nikalava sake to yatri kiraye main badhotaree na kerani pade
 3
 general dibbon main seat par rumal rakh seat kabje main karnaa galat nahin lagata, naa hi toilet se chen main bandhe magge gum ho janaa, par vashbasin par thukna or pankhe par juute rakhana sabase galat baat he
 It needs to be declared a punishable offense
 4
 The Prime Minister talks about the bullet train, but the hand comes on the 'boo' and 'late' train, we have got used to it, just how long it is to be printed while giving tickets on every late train , So there will be no hurry to leave the house
 5
 Apart from this, if the railway minister wants to give more facilities like every seat has a charging point, relieve the lower berth converters and the most special seats should be widened a bit to make it move

 dard sir main, lekin takalif aisi jaise bachche ko janm dene se pehle maa ko hoti he
 That means labor pains or say pain like childbirth
 ye sunne main jitna ajeeb he, asaram kii beemaari utani hi rahasyamayi he
 Because it is a disease that is neither cured
 or naa hi khulkar saamne aati he, jabaki asaram ke timaardaaron kaa daawa he ki is beemaari se sir main hi prasav vednaa kaa ahsaas hone lagata he
 Now obviously, the effect of the disease which is so strange, it will only complicate the disease
 asaram kii beemaari ne doctoron se lekar kanoon ke jaankaron tak ko bhram main daal diya he
 Asaram says he has a truncated colic, while doctors say he is fit
 balki naa sirf durust hai, aisi beemaari to hoti nahin
 Whatever his devotees are trying to tell Baba sick, they should be shocked to hear what they say
 dusron kii chhodie, asaram kii mahila vaidya nita (neeche tasviir main) ne hi baba kii takalif bayaan karne ke liye maa ke dard yani prasav vednaa ko bhi kam bataa diya
 When asked about the disease, Asaram's son i
e
 Narayan Sai, he also tried to show the same pain in Baba in the prison
 ye or baat he ki dard bayaan karne se pehle beemaari kaa naam bataane ke liye asaram ke bete narayan sai ko kaagazon kaa sahaara lenaa pad gaya
 Narayan Sai could not even tell the name of his father's illness, due to which Asaram has been suffering continuously for the last 12-14 years
 asaram kii beemaari rahasyamayi bhi kam nahin he
 Because even if the disease does not catch up to the MRI scan, even a doctor who specializes in medical science can be deceived to identify it and if the same disease makes you feel childbirth in the head, then this disease must be called mysterious
 isi beemaari ke naam par asaram naa sirf adaalat se raahat kii maang kar rahe hai, balki ye bhi kah rahe hai ki iske ilaaj ke liye unhen roj jail main hi mahila vaidya chahie
 The court will decide on this later, but the doctors who treat them right now are not ready to believe Asaram's argument
 medicine kii aadhunik padhai kar chuke doctoron ne asaram kaa check-ap kiya to report ai ki asaram to bilkul feet hai
 When there is no major disease, how will there be great pain
 to phir kya he is dard kaa maajaraa? kya asaram beemaari kaa bahaanaa bana rahe hai?ye jaanane ke liye 4 sitambar ke us khat kaa majamoon pard lijie, jise jodhpur jail main band asaram ne jodhpur ke district or seshan court ke jaj ko likhaa tha-seva menmaneey jila evam seshan nyaayadhishjila- jodhpur (raaj
 ) Honorable, subjective article that i have been suffering from a disease called Trinadi Shul since last 13 and half years and i am being treated by Vaidya Nitaji for the last 2-3 years
 jo mukhyat panchakarma kaa ek bhaag shirodhara dwaara upachaar karti hai, jisamen kareeb do ghante kaa samay lagata he
 Therefore, you are requested to take action on the request of Vaidya to call Nitaji in the Central Jail every day for the next eight days for the treatment of my above mentioned illness
 -santashri asaram bapumamla adaalat ke daayre main aa gaya
 The medical board sat on the court's order
 board main ek physician, ek neurologist or ek urologist ko shaamil kiya gaya
 When the board of these three doctors investigated, it was found that Asaram, who cares about his age and terrible disease, is perfectly fit
 is bich adaalat bhi asaram kii guhaar par taarikh par taarikh detii rahi
 The hearing first took place on 19 September
 phir 24 sitambar ko, lekin 24 ko adaalat ne kah diya- agali sunwaayee 30 sitambar ko hogi
 Asaram's judicial custody is being completed on September 30
 yani saaf he ki asaram kii jamaanat par agali kaarywahi tak asaram ko apane mahila vaidya nita se naa to ilaaj milegaa, naa unke haath kaa khaanaa
 Asaram's serious illness is raising many big questions - Question number 1- When does this pain arise? Question number 2 - Why has this pain not emerged for the last 24 days? Question number 3 - Why did the modern world of medicines dismiss these? From the womb of questions, this question arises whether Asaram's disease is a big excuse
 kahin masalaa wo to nahin, jisaki taraf asaram ke puraane sadhak ungali uthaate rahe hai
 Asaram describes his illness as Trinadi shul, which is called Anantwat in the language of Ayurveda and Trigeminal neuralgia in English
 ek naaballig ladki ke yon shoshan ke aarope main jail main band asaram isi beemaari kaa hawala dekar mahila vaidya nita ko maang rahe the har roj do ghante ke liye
 Asaram's difficulties are about to increase, when someone opens a secret mouth, then that reality also comes out, which no one expected
 asaram ke saath aisa hi ho rahaa he
 Now from what Chindwada Ashram director Sharat Chand and cook Prakash have told the police, Asaram's difficulties seem to be increasing
 asaram or unke bete narayan sai ne kaha tha ki peedit ladki maansik rup se biimaar thi, lekin police ko diye bayaan main unke chhindwara gurukul ke diarector sharat chandra ne kaha he ki peedita ko koi beemaari nahin thi
 The girl was in contact with the warden of the ashram, Shilpi, and she knows what the disease was
 asaram ke ahmedabad ashram se nirdesh milane ke baad hi unhone shilpi urf sanchita gupta ko naukari par rakhaa tha
 The Jodhpur police rushed to Chhindwara Gurukul with Sharatchand to corroborate Sharatchand's statements and gather evidence related to it
 duusari taraf asaram ke rasoiyaa prakaash ne bhi poochtacha main khulaasa kiya ki asaram kaa mobile phone vahi rakhata tha
 Shilpi, Sharat Chandra and Shiva received a call to bring the victim to Jodhpur Madai Kutia
 khud asaram ko pehle se pataa tha ki peedita madi kutiyaa main aane vaali he or iske liye intjaam ke aadesh bhi de die gaye the
 When Asaram touched a girl or a woman, no one would protest
 balki sari ladkiyaan samarpan ke liye hi aati thim
 It is reported that the police can make Sharatchandra and Prakash a government witness
 lekin is bich mastermind shilpi kii talash bhi jari he

 On the very first day of its budget session, there was a lot of uproar in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly
 rajyapal ke abhibhaashan ke dauraan bahujan samaaj party ke vidhayakon ne khub bavaal kaata
 The extent was reached when two mlas of Rashtriya Lok Dal Party stood half-naked by taking off their clothes to demand payment of dues to the farmers
 vidhansabha kii garima ko chot pahunchane vaali is ghatana ke baad jab dobaaraa vidhansabha baithi to congress vidhanmandal dal ke netaa pradeep maathur ne chutki lete hue kaha ki areldi ke vidhayakon ne salmaan khan se prabhavit hokar apane kapade utaar die
 Coming out, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Azam Khan went a step ahead and said that if he had taken off his clothes, people would have known about his manhood
 rajyapal ke abhibhaashan ke dauraan areldi ke vidhayak sudesh sharma or virpal rathi ne ganna kisaanon or mazdooron kii bakaayaa raashi kii maang ko lekar gusse main apane-apane kurte utaar diye
 The BSP created a ruckus and its mlas came in the Well and started shouting slogans
 udhar, bijepi ne rajyapal ke abhibhaashan kaa bahishkaar karte hue sadan se walkout kar diya
 The House was embarrassed by what happened during the Governor's address to the UP Legislative Assembly, but the statements made by the ruling party leader Azam Khan and the Congress Legislature Party leader Pradeep Mathur after that were even more embarrassing
 pradeep maathur ne kapade utaarne vaale donon vidhayakon kii tulana salmaan khan se kar di
 However, he later described this statement inside the House as a joke
 unhone kaha ki jo in vidhayakon ne tarika apanaaya wo vidhansabha main shobhaa nahin detaa
 Deputy Leader of RLD Legislature Party and Sudesh Sharma, MLA from Modinagar and Virpal Rathi, MLA from Chhatrauli Baghpat, staged a sit-in in the Well of the Monsoon session and demanded the government to pay the dues of sugarcane farmers and the Modinagar mill which was closed
 It has been given compensation to its laborers as well
 us vakt unhen sarkaar se aashwaasan mila tha
 They alleged that the government could spend 300 million rupees on dancing and singing at the Saifai Festival, but was not ready to understand the pain of the farmers
 areldi se vidhayak sudesh sharma ne kaha ki hoicourt ke aadesh ke baavjood 200 karod rupee modi sugar mil par kisaanon kaa bakaayaa he
 Many times this matter has been raised in the Assembly
 ise lekar vidhansabha adhyaksh, sansadeey kaarymantri, mukhyamantri ne aashwast kiya tha
 On behalf of the government, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Azam Khan said that these mlas have nakedly hurt the dignity of the government
 puure nange ho jate or shobhaa pate: ajam khansansadeey kaarymantri ajam khan ne saath hi ye bhi kah diya, 'aaj sadan main jo kapade utaarne kii ghatana hui he, usamen vidhayakon kii taraf se kaam aadha rah gaya
 If the bottom part were to be seen, then something would have been known about his manhood
 to jo kuch bhi unhone kiya wo adhuri mardaangi kaa pradarshan tha
 We were waiting for him to get the whole international charm
 agar baaki hisse kaa bhi prardashan kar dete to
 On the other hand, Mayawati's party BSP also whipped the government fiercely
 vidhanmandal dal ke netaa swami prasad maurya ne kaha ki har koi pareshaan he

 green pataakhon se paryaavaran pradooshan 30 fisadi tak hoga kamakuar code se ho sakegi asli green pataakhon kii pahachaanarashtriya rajdhani dilli or ensiaar main pabandi ke baavjood log pataakhe jala paaenge
 Green crackers will be available in the market in Diwali

 Also, people will be able to celebrate Diwali with great pomp
 in pataakhon kii keemat bhi kam rakhi jaaegi
 Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said that environment friendly green firecrackers will not cost much
 hamane iske liye parameter tay kiya he
 Green firecrackers will reduce air pollution by more than 30 percent
 unhone kaha ki bazaar main phek green pataakhe na benche jaaen, iske liye bhi kadam uthaae jaaenge
 The Union Minister said that fake green firecrackers will have QR code, through which it will be known which green cracker is and which pollution is the more spreadable cracker
 aapako bataa den ki rashtriya rajdhani dilli samet desh ke kai shaharon main pataakhon kii vajah se diwali ke avasar par vaayu pradooshan kaaphi bad jaataa he
 This makes it difficult for people to get out of the house
 sarkaar kii tamaam koshishon or supreme court kii paabandiyon ke baavjood dilli main pradooshan ko puri tarah se rokane main kamyaabi nahin mil rahi he
 On the occasion of Diwali in Delhi, there has been a debate for many years to deal with the problem of air pollution
 kisne taiyaar kiye green pataakhe?shanivaar ko kendriya mantri harshavardhan ne kaha ki saal 2017 main bhi chennai main yojit indian international science festival main pradooshan par hi charchaa kii gai thi
 Air pollution due to firecrackers increases considerably in Diwali
 lihaaja maine vaigyanikon se apil kii thi ki wo green pataakhe bana sakate hai or vaayu pradooshan ko kam karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 After this, scientists from CSIR and NEERI have prepared green crackers
 kendriya mantri harshavardhan ne bataaya ki anaar, pencil, chakri or phuljhadi jaise pataakhe bazaar main bechney ke liye taiyaar hai
 They have QR code, which will tell whether the cracker is fake or original
 green pataakhon ko banane ke liye 230 emoyu or 165 qaraar par dastakhat kiye gaye hai
 While the Election Commission has expressed concern over the continuation of political donations from unknown sources citing unknown sources, the change in the FCRA Act has raised concerns that foreign companies may interfere in Indian elections
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki fahrren countribution (regulation) act (FCRA) ke kai sanshodhano se videshi strot se raajnneetik dalon ko chanda milanaa aasaan ho gaya he
 The FCRA Act was enacted in the year 1976
 vastav main iskaa uddeshy raajnneetik dalon ko videshi prabhaav se bachaana tha
 This was further clarified by FCRA 2010
 FCRA act 1976 kii dhara 4 or FCRA 2010 kii dhara 3 main kaha gaya he, 'koi bhi raajnneetik dal yaa uskaa padaadhikari videsh se koi madad sweekaar nahin kar saktaa
 Violation of any of the provisions of FCRA can lead to a jail term of five years and or fine
 janpratinidhitiv kanoon 1951 kii dhara 29 bi ke mutabik bhi raajnneetik dal kisi videshi strot yaa sarkari companiyon se fund nahin le sakate
 Action on BJP and Congress According to FCRA 2010 and 1976, any such company is considered as a foreign company in which more than 50% shareholding is foreign
 bijepi or congress dwaara videshi sroton or companiyon se kathith rup se chanda lene ko lekar dilli hoicourt main chunauti di gai thi or unhen notice mila tha
 In 2014, the Delhi High Court admitted that both parties had violated the FCRA and RP Act and asked the central government to take punitive action against them within six months
 lekin karrwai karne kii jagah centre sarkaar ne finance bill 2016 ke dwaara pehle to FCRA 2010 main hi sanshodhan kar is tarah ke ulalanghanon ko hi vaid bana diya or duusare, iskaa vistaar FCRA act 1976 tak kar diya yani ise 1976 se hi lagu maan liya gaya
 Strictly on NGO softening of foreign funds! This change means that if the foreign shareholding in an Indian company is within the limits prescribed by FEMA and other rules of foreign investment, then the donation by the company will not be considered as foreign source
 bhale hi usamen 50 fisadi se zyada videshi nivesh ho
 This means that foreign companies can continue to donate to political parties
 duusari taraf, centre sarkaar ne greenpis india enjio kii videshi funding par calf sakhti barti he or pichley varshon main hajaaron enjio ke epasiaar license radd kiye gaye hai
 Prior to his retirement in November 2018, the then Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat had said, 'the Election Commission believes that elections cannot be allowed foreign funding in any way
 ' lekin ise rokane ke liye chunaav ayog ne kya kadam uthaae isaki koi jaankaree nahin he
 At least two such petitions are pending in the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court demanding that the Central Government be compelled to take action against the BJP and the Congress, who have violated the FCR Act
 yah bhi maang kii gai he act main badlaav ko waapas liya jaae
 Both the major political parties have taken donations from foreign sources and government companies like STC and MMTC and hence they are accused of violation of FCRA and RP Act

 ) One director-level officer has been removed from his post for not having toilet paper rolls at the railway board chairman's bungalow
 saath hi chairman ke bangale par alag-alag vakt par kaam karne vaale teen karmchaariyon ne bhi pratadna kaa aarope lagaaya he
 NDTV India has many documents related to this
 13 lakh logon ko rojgaar dene vaali railway ke karmchaariyon se lekar adhikari tak system ke sataae hai or khasbaat yah he ki aarope sidhe railway board ke chairman arunendra kumaar par lag rahe hai
 The complainant is not a minor employee but a senior divisional mechanical engineer posted in the Northern Zone - Orders Ajay Singh, who is alleged to have not sent toilet paper to the Railway Board Chairman's house and then not visited his wife later Sent to training to do
 itnaa hi nahin unke pad par duusare adhikari kii posting kar di gai
 On August 9, Sai, the Protocol Officer of the Railway Board Chairman, called Ajay Singh and said that CRB Sir's children have come and sent the toilet paper roll to the house
 ajay singh ne toilet paper role bhijwane se inkaar kar diya
 Immediately, the chairman Railway Board's wife got a call, in which she questioned why you would not send toilet paper rolls
 ajay singh ke ek baar phir manaa karne par siarabi kii patni ne kaha ki vah chif maikenical ejeeniyar se baat karengi
 Then Ajay Singh informed his boss Chief Mechanical Engineer AK Puthiya about the incident
 eke puthiya ne baat khatm karne kii garaj se kaha ki toilet paper role bangale par bhijwa do, lekin ajay singh ne phir inkaar kar diya
 Then Puthiya said that he is in Lucknow, will return and talk on Monday
 somvaar ko ajay singh baroda house main eke puthiya se milane pahunche
 Puthiya sahib said that CRB Madam has complained to you
 aise bhi tumhen siarabi madam ko na nahin kahana chahie tha
 Go meet Madam, but Ajay Singh Madam did not go to meet CRB
 iske baad 26 agast ko diviginal maikenical ejeeniyar ko−ordination ajay singh ko 5 hafte kii training par bhej diya gaya or isi bich 12 sitambar ko ajay singh kii post par eses ahaluvalia kii posting kaa aadesh nikaal diya gaya
 Surprisingly, the toilet paper roll that caused the ruckus was that of the Railways, which cannot be used for home or personal use, but this is not the first such complaint against the current Chairman of the Railway Board
 2010 main arunendra kumaar ke bangale par kaam karne vaale rajkumaar ne shikaayat kii he ki arunendra kumaar or unki patni uske saath marpet karte hai
 Madam kills me everyday and i will be mad if i am not given a posting from here
 2011 main arunendra kumaar ke bangale par bataur khalasi kaam karne vaale gokul singh ne bhi apane saath hone vaale amanviya vyavhaar ko lekar diarem offis main shikaayat di
 Gokul wrote that Madame kills me by drinking alcohol everyday
 maa, baap or bacchon ko gaaliyaan detii hai
 Even if you do not get a holiday and ask for some goods, we do not give money
 2013 main jab arunendra kumaar bataur jiem bilaspur main tainaat the tab unke bangale par kaam karne vaale kishor kumaar nayak ne bhi pratadna kii shikaayat kii
 Nayak even wrote in the complaint letter that now it seems that going to the bungalow means death, fear, fear
 chairman railway board or unki patni ke khilaaf ye aisi shikaayatein hai, jinke dastavej enditivi india ke paas maujuud hai, lekin yah bhi sach he ki abhi tak aisi kisi shikaayat par koi karrwai nahin hui he
 Tried to talk to the Railway Minister and the Minister of State for Railways on this issue too, but the Railway Minister refused to reply and the Minister of State for Railways did not give an appointment
 railway kii durdasha kehane sunne yaa bataane kii nahin, dekhne or samajhane kii cheez he, par sawaal he ki jab chairman railway board ke ghar toilet paper kii muft supplai bhi railway kii hi jimmedaari ho or agar koi eemaandaar officer aisa karne se manaa kare to use torchar karne ke liye training par bhej diya jaae to phir bhagwaan hi batayega ki sarkaar ke tamaam daavon ke baavjood indian railway ke achche din kab or kaise aaenge

 The Nobel Prize Committee has reported that these three researched the biological clocks (biological clock) that control the human sleep-wake process, which led to their being selected for the honor

 Even when she does not want, her eyelids blink

 Scientists also studied in research how the body changes in the entire cycle of 24 hours a day
 sabase ascharyajanak baat to ye he ki is ghadi kaa sambandh prithvi ke roteshan se hota he
 That is why it works according to day and night

 These thoughts have been expressed in that
 shmit ke mutabik internet ke maamle main bharat abhi us jagah he, jahaan america 1994 main tha
 That is, four years before the birth of Google
 unhone kaha ki bharat ko shaharon or kasbon main internet kaa prasar karnaa chahie jiskaa uski arthvyavastha or samaaj par sakaaratmak asar hoga
 The former Google chief executive said he saw the creative potential of the people of India around him in Silicon Valley
 silicon vaili main 40 pratishat nayi companiyaan bhartiya mul ke udhyamiyon kii hai
 He said, guess what will happen if India's entrepreneurial innovators, in their early stages, manage to form big global companies by getting institutional support in their own country
 ve duniya badal denge
 Hundreds of companies focused on the Internet will be set up and will succeed by focusing on the interests of Indian consumers
 unhone lekh main yah sawaal poocha ki kya unamem se koi company agali google ban sakati hai? phir khud hi jawaab diya ki haa, bilkul
 Schmidt said it won't happen for some time
