 Vajpayee gave this word to Indira at a time when India had achieved a great success in the 1971 war on Pakistan
 1971 ke yuddh main paak ke 90,368 sainikon or nagarikon ne sarender kiya tha
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said in the House that the way Indira played her role in this fight is truly praiseworthy

 "jab vaajapeyi is ghatana ke do dashak baad piem ban gaye, to unhone ek or tivi patrkaar rajat sharma ko die intervyuu main durga vaale kathan se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Atal then said, i did not use Durga Upma for Indira

 On the other hand, the grand Ganga Shiva temple at Nagpuri on the banks of Bhagirathi also merged into the Ganges
 ganga kaa ye mandir ganga ke prachand veg ke chalate khatre kii jad main aa gaya tha or krodhit ganga ise bhi apane saath le gai
 This temple of Maa Ganga fell down with a plethora of cards
 aitihaasik va puranic mahatv ke is mandir ke bare main manyata he ki khud shiv yahaan is ghat par aakar na keval ganga main snaan karte hai, balki yahaan virajkar logon kii manokamanaayen bhi puri karte hai
 But this time the angry Ganga neither spared this Shiva temple nor Ganga temple
 ek baar phir yahaan ganga ke saamne jo aayaa nestnabud ho gaya
 Seeing this anger of Ganga, people are now in panic, because till now people had the hope of God
 ab jabaki bhagwaan hi surakshit nahin hai, to sankat main fanse logon ko apni suraksha ke bare main khud hi sochna padegaa

 chand-taare tod laane kii baat to na jane kitni sach hoti hogi, lekin bagpat main teen premiyon ne jo kuch kiya usne unhen salaakhon ke peeche jarur pahunchaa diya he
 Actually it happened that three students of Baghpat dug up the tombs at the behest of the tantric to get the love of the girls
 teenon chaatr grajuation kar rahe hai or andhvishwaas main ghirakar inhone aisa kadam uthaaya
 The tantrik had asked them to bring the dead body and make it the talisman, so that they can find any girl

 premika kaa pyaar paane ke liye aashiq haath kii nasen kaat lete hai, pyaar paane ke liye jaan dene or lene vaale premiyon ke bare main bhi aapane suna hoga
 But this will probably be the first case of resorting to the corpse to get the love of a girl

 police adhikari bhi maukey par pahunche or is bich kisi ne gaanv ke teen ladakon par shaq jataayaa, jinamein arjuna, sonu or anuj shaamil the
 All three were seen outside the cemetery
 iske baad police ne bina der kiye pehle to khodi gai kabron ko band karavaaya or phir aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 Police also arrested laborer Karmapal along with Anuj and Sonu
 karmpal ko teenon chaatr 20 rupee kaa bidi kaa bandal dilaane ke bahaane lekar aae the
 The arrested students told that they did this to befriend the girl, because no girl was friends with them
 is bich ve ek tantric se mili, jisane unhen murde kii haddi laane ke liye kaha, jisase wo unke liye taabeej banaata
 The tantric promised him that after wearing this talisman, the girl would be forced to befriend him
 ek chaatr arjuna or tantric ab bhi police kii giraft main nahin aae hai, lekin police kaa daawa he ki unhen jald hi giraftaar kar liya jayega

 bihar main mahagathbandhan ke bich lagaataar tanaav bad rahaa he
 On Thursday, rjd's Maner MLA Bhai Virender threatened to withdraw support from the Nitish government
 unhone kaha tha ki jediu ko yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki argedy ke paas 80 vidhayak hai, mahagathbandhan main vahi hoga jo vah chahenge
 At the same time, on Friday, RJD has given a befitting reply from JDU
 jediu pravaktaa ajay alok ne kaha ki satta hamaare liye jaruri nahin he, vah 5 minute ke andar sarkaar ko chhod denge
 While sources say that Nitish Kumar is adamant on Tejashwi Yadav's resignation, RJD is also not in the mood for resignation
 khabar he ki agar tejasvi yadav istipha nahin denge, to nitish kumaar khud hi istipha de sakate hai
 Sonia spoke to Nitish Amid growing tension between the JDU and RJD over the resignation of Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav, Congress President Sonia Gandhi spoke to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over phone
 iske alaava sonia gandhi ne lalu prasad yadav se bhi baat kii he
 It is clear that Sonia Gandhi is trying to save the grand alliance moving towards Tut
 jediu kaa palatwantjay alok ne kaha kimahagathbandhan ke netaa nitish kumaar hi hai, jo log 80 vidhayakon kii dhamkee de rahe hai unhen dhyaan rakhana chahie ki vah satta ke bhukhe nahin hai, 5 minute main satta ko chhod denge
 Nitish Kumar will not back down from his stand against corruption
 unhone kaha ki jediu abhi bhi tejasvi yadav kii safai se santusht nahin he
 KC Tyagi said - JDU veteran leader KC Tyagi said that RJD mlas are making such statements with arrogance and airs
 is prakaar ke bayaan nahin dene chahie
 He said that Nitish Kumar has never compromised on the issue of corruption, we are against corruption
 kasee tyaagi bole ki teenon partiyon ne milakar nitish kumaar ko mahagathbandhan kaa netaa mana he, isliye unke sawaalon par bhi dhyaan dena jaruri he
 What RJD MLA Bhai Virendra said in the face of this confrontation, RJD MLA Bhai Virendra also threatened to withdraw support from Nitish government in gestures
 patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue bhai virendra ne kaha, 'yah baat nahin bhulani chahie ki argedy ke paas 80 vidhayak hai or mahagathbandhan main vahi hoga jo vah chahenge
 On the question of breaking the JDU and forming a government, the RJD MLA said, "we believe in democracy
" ham jediu ke kisi vidhayak ko todane kii koshish nahin kar rahe
 This is the strategy of RJD, while RJD strategists are also assuming that Nitish Kumar cannot postpone the action for a long time
 aise main wo apane vikalp ke bare main bhi ranneeti bana rahe hai
 According to the strategy, if Tejashwi Yadav is dismissed, all the ministers of RJD can also resign
 magar, aisa karne ke baavjood bhi argedy nitish sarkaar se samarthan waapas nahin legi
 RJDRJD sources will continue to support that RJD Janata Dal will continue to support the United Government so that it does not go with the BJP again
 duusari taraf argedy ye bhi nahin chaahati ki is najuk maukey par wo sarkaar se baahar ho
 Because the family of Lalu Prasad Yadav is implicated in the case of CBI and ED
 aise main bagaiyr sarkaar ke rahanaa unhen kamjor kar saktaa he
 However, the RJD may also consider the option of forming a government with some independents with the Congress or the Yadav mlas in the JDU

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, defending his batsmen in poor form, said on Tuesday that his team got a big and unmatched innings from any player in the do or die match against New Zealand on Wednesday in the triangular one-day series
 needed
 dhoni ne match kii purv sandhya par samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘aap chaahate hai ki prayek match main, visheshkar is tarah kii wicket par koi bhi ek ballebaaj badi pari khele
 This can be called the best performance of any one player because one of your batsmen maintains one end and the other supports him
 ’unhone kaha, ‘yah kaaphi had tak aapaki maansikta par nirbhar karata he kyonki ekadivasiy cricket main aapako pehali gend se hi gendbaajon par haaavee hokar shaat khilne hote hai
 Not only in the subcontinent but in the whole world you will see that wickets are being made very flat especially for the one-day matches
 ’dhoni ne kaha, ‘yadi aap ballebaaji patan kii baat karte hai to teen match main do baar aisa hua he lekin yadi aisa kaha jaataa he ki hamaari team kii ballebaaji itani hi majboot he to main isse sahamat nahin hum
 One thing we cannot deny is that our batsmen failed in two matches and will have to overcome this problem
 hamen wicket par tikkar achche ran banane honge
 Dhoni admitted that it was not easy to digest the 200-run defeat against New Zealand and the eight-wicket defeat against Sri Lanka but said the team was capable of recovering from it
 unhone kaha, ‘team ke taur par ham isse kaaphi niraash hai
 But you must have seen that all the matches are one-sided, which shows that if you lose a few wickets in the beginning, then the batting collapses
 hamane puure toornament ke dauraan aisa dekha he
 The Indian captain said, "the batsmen are working on their strategy
" ve galat shaat khelkar out nahin ho rahe hai
 They want to do their best but it doesn't happen many times
 pichley do match main jab hamaari ballebaaji kaa patan hua tab aisa hi hua
 So whenever you are at the crease, you have to find a way to score runs because the pressure constantly increases
 ’unhone kaha, ‘aapako kisi khilaadi ke majboot paksh ko dekhnaa chahie
 What kind of strength can a player bring to the team
 aap ravidanr jadeja ko hi lo
 If some matches are dropped, then his bowling performance has been good for the last year and a half

 ' uttar pradesh main satta badalane kaa asar raajnneeti kii praarambhik paathshaala yani panchayaton main bhi dikhaai dene laga he
 When the district panchayat president was elected at the end of 2010 in Shravasti, Bahujan Samaj Party (bsp)-backed candidate Rukmini Singh won here without any opposition
 magar samaajawaadee party (sapa) kii sarkaar banane ke baad ve jila panchayat sadasyon ko khatakane lageen
 When members of the no confidence motion threatened to go to their chair, she joined the SP along with her husband Ram Pratap Singh
 shravasti ke jila panchayat sadsy raman singh kehete hai, ''rukmini ne panchayat adhyaksh banane ke baad gaanvon kii dasha sudhaarney ke liye koi prayaas nahin kiya
 However, Rukmini says that she has not changed the party to save the chair
 kuch aisa hi vakya rampur main saamne aayaa he, jahaan basapa samarthit panchayat adhyaksh abdul salaam satta badalte hi sapa ke kheme main jane kii jugat main lag gaye
 The BSP showed him the way out as soon as he came to know about his changed attitude
 hardoi main kamini agarwal ne bhi hathi par savaar hokar panchayat adhyaksh kaa chunaav jeeta, lekin pati mukesh agarwal ke cycle savaar hote hi ve basapa chhod sapa main shaamil ho gayi
 These few examples indicate that the game of changing party loyalty has started in the district panchayats of the state
 2010 ke ant main hue chunaav main kul 72 siton main se 55 par basapa ne jeet kaa paracham laharaaya tha, jabaki das siten sapa ne jiti thi
 The rest was shared between the Congress, the RLD and the BJP
 yahi haal pradesh ke 813 kshetra panchayat adhyakshon (block pramukh) ke chunaav kaa bhi tha
 It was only in the light of power that the BSP leaders placed their relatives in the chair of the District Panchayat President without contesting the member in about two dozen seats
 in jila panchayat adhyakshon par koi aanch na aae, iske liye bhi sattarudh basapa ne 'uttar pradesh kshetra panchayat or jila panchayat sanshodhan vidheyak-2011' ke jariye kshetra panchayat pramukh or jila panchayat adhyakshon ke khilaaf laae jane vaale avishvaas prastaav kii miyaad ko ek varsh se badhaakar do varsh kar diya
 However, this bill did not get the approval of the Governor
 magar prachand bahumat ke saath sarkaar banane ke baad sapa ne ukt sanshodhan vidheyak ko waapas lekar basapai jila panchayat adhyaksh or block pramukhon ko hataane kaa rasta saaf kar diya
 Then in almost every district there was a flood of no-confidence motions against the district panchayat presidents and block heads
 khaataa khulaa hamirpur se
 Here, BSP candidate Sanjay Dixit lost the chair
 isi tarah sidgharthanagar ke pramod yadav, kannauj main munni devi ambedkar kii kursi chhin gai
 In Azamgarh, Meera Azad, wife of senior BSP leader Gandhi Azad's brother, also turned away
 isi tarah bijanour kii nasrin saifi, sonbhadra ke dilip maury, pilibhit kii anitha verma ko bhi apni kursi se haath dhonaa padaa
 Mirzapur, Lucknow, Meerut, Moradabad, Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr are witnessing changes
 barabanki main bhaajapa ke panchayat prakoshth ke purv adhyaksh raamji tiwari bataate hai ki basapa samarthit jila panchayat adhyakshon or block pramukhon ne dedh varsh ke kaarykaal main koi vikaas kaary nahin kiya
 This caused great dissatisfaction among the district and area panchayat members
 chunki inhen avishvaas prastaav laakar hataane kii miyaad badha di gai thi, aise main in jila panchayat adhyakshon or blaak pramukhon ne nirankush dhang se apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kiya
 To avoid the danger of getting the chair of the district panchayat presidents and the block chiefs, these leaders have engaged in an exercise to find a place in the ruling party
 kareeb teen darjan jila panchayat adhyaksh or 100 ke kareeb block pramukh sapa main aane ko baichaiyn hai
 Many of these have contacted Panchayatiraj Minister Balram Yadav
 yadav kehete hai, ''jin logon ne satta kaa dabaav banaakar jila panchayat adhyaksh yaa block pramukh kii kursi hathiyaan he, unamem se adhikansh sapa main shaamil hona chaahate hai
 Such people fear that rivals may bring a no-confidence motion against them
 haalanki sapa kisi ke bhi khilaaf badale kii bhaavana se karrwai nahin karegi
 "the SP government may be denying any role in this matter, but the way the bsp's district panchayat presidents and block chiefs are losing their chair one by one, it has warmed up the political atmosphere of the state
 
 basapa ke pradesh adhyaksh swami prasad maury kehete hai, ''sapa ne sarkaar banaate hi panchayaton ke loktantric swaroop ko khatm karnaa shuru kar diya he
 "but SP state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary hit back at the BSP, saying," The public is now responding to those who forcibly seized the chair of democracy in the BSP government

 amir bananaa koun nahin chahta he lekin yah bhi sach he ki yah koi jaadui kala nahin he
 However, there are some habits that you can get rich soon by bringing in your routine
 yakeen maniye amir banane vaale tamaam log bas kismat se paisa nahin kamaate
 Rather, they continue in their work in a planned way

 Once you set a goal, focus on achieving it
 safalataa haath lagane ke baad aap khud hi apane pairon par khadey hone ke chalate amir mahasoos karenge
 a research says that 80 percent of the rich in the world are the ones who have done all the unthinkable work to achieve the goal

 It is said that knowledge is useful for you

 Do not let the opportunity go, the rich person focuses on earning

 main uske sapane main chalaa gaya
 His soul was reading those files
 un aankadon ko bhi
 He was hiding from the soul
 filon ko uske haathon se chin rahaa tha
 The first time i saw the battle between the soul and the officer
 vah afasar dahej main mila thermos laayaa tha
 It was said that tea is drunk by the wife's hand
 use pataa he ki imaan kuch nahin hota he
 The soul is nothing
 uske bachche tab bhi use mahaan samajhenge
 The children of Chanakyapuri and Pandara Road are sensible
 imaan se sawaal nahin karte hai
 Do not talk to the soul
 bharti nagar or kaaka nagar ke bachche bhi bharat ko lekar baichaiyn nahin hai
 They do not need correct figures
 unhen har shaam aankada dikh jaataa he
 When the mother or father comes home from the office
 chup rahane ke liye jate hai, chup hokar aa jate hai
 That officer said one thing in his dream
 hamen maut kaa dar nahin he
 We are dead before we are killed
 usne sochaa ki main baichaiyn ho jaaoongaa
 i have read the Gita
 aatma amar he
 The officer said that the soul is immortal
 yahi to musiibat he
 The souls of dead people are also immortal
 uski amarta hi to satta he
 Power is immortal

 He declined my question
 maine puch liya
 This is what he said
 akhbaar to log khreedenge
 They have a habit of buying
 vaise hi, jaise hamen marane kii aadat he
 i was awake from sleep
 barish ho rahi thi
 Raisina looked like a bride among the drops in the evening light
 george orvel kii kitaab 1984 padhate hue sona nahin chahie
 Anyone who reads this book will have a sleeping dream
 uske khwaab gulabi ho jaaenge
 Newspapers will be published automatically
 akhbaar main khabar nahin chhapegi, to akhbaar phir bhi bikega
 If the channels are not in news, then the channels will still be seen
 patrkaar kii zarurat nahin he
 He can no longer go stealthily
 jab pathak or darshak yah jaanakar chup rah sakate hai, to phir patrkaar ko chup rahane main kya dikkat he
 that is the problem
 jalwaayu parivartan se lakhon logon ke visthapit hone ke baad bhi lagata he, uskaa visthaapan kabhi nahin hoga
 There will be no displacement of the reader
 darshak kaa visthaapan nahin hoga
 It is flower-proof from dangers
 loktantr kaa yah jalwaayu parivartan he
 Temperature is high
 pathakon kaa shukriya
 To keep buying newspapers without news
 bagair khabaron ke channel dekhte rahane ke liye
 Welcome to the decision of the Finance Minister
 khabaron kii maut par shraadh kaa bhoj ho
 Do not wait for the thirteenth
 marane ke din hi bhoj kaa aayojan ho
 i saw, like the officers, people were not eyeing
 yah maine sapane main nahin dekha
 Saw after meeting people after waking up from a deep sleep
 ek darshak ne whotsap kiya tha
 Permission is required before we can see you
 aap kisi ke gaurav ko sharminda nahin kar sakate hai

 rajasthan ke kota main hui baari barish ke kaaran madhyapradesh ke bhind main halaat kharaab ho gaye hai
 In fact, due to heavy rains in Kota, the Kota Barrage became overflowing and its gates had to be opened, due to which the water level in the Chambal River rose and water entered the villages of Bhind district
 logon ko hui pareshaanibhind jile kechambal nadikinare based ek darjan gaanv baadh se ghir gaye hai
 Overnight, the water increased so much that when people woke up in the morning, they found their houses surrounded by flood water
 pareshaani kaa alam yah he ki pashuon kaa chaara bhi pani kii bhent chadh chukaa he
 On the other hand, even dry wood is not available for cooking, due to which food is not available in the houses
 vahimbadhake kaaran ilaake main ab sabji milane main bhi pareshaani ho rahi he
 Power problem is the biggest problem of light, because due to flood, the electric poles have been submerged in water and the power line has been cut
 mobile network bhi baari barish ke baad dhwast ho gaye hai, jiske kaaran log apano kaa haal bhi nahin jaan paa rahe
 The main reason behind the fact that rescue teams are present is heavy rains in Kota
 chambal nadi main kota bairaj dam se do lakh pachaas hajaar kusek se adhik pani relies karne se bhind ke ater ilaake ke nichle based ek darjan gaanv baadh kii chapet me aa gaye hai
 The danger is even greater because the danger mark 119 on the bridge connecting Bhind to Etawah on the Chambal River
 80 meter he, jabaki chambal nadi khatre ke nishaan se teen meter upar yani 122
 Flowing at 86 meters
 nadi ke vikaraal rup ko dekhte hue prasasana ne rescue timen bula lee hai
 No loss of life, however, the biggest relief is that no loss of life has been reported from Bhind
 lekin yadi jald hi nadi kaa pani kam nahin hua to logon ke saamne badi pareshaani khadi ho jaaegi
 On the other hand, the administration will have to be on alert even after the water has receded, because after this, there is the highest possibility of rain-related diseases increasing

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter vidhi ayog ne 'adaalat kii avmaananaa' kii paribhaasha simit karne ke vidhi mantralay ke ek prastaav ko mangalvaar ko khaarij kar diya or kaha ki kanoon main sanshodhan ke baavjood adaalatein avmaananaa ke liye logon ko dandit karne ke apane adhikaar kaa istemaal kar sakati hai
 Because their authority comes from the constitution and not from the legislation
 adalati aadesh yaa maryaada kii avmaananaa par sarkari peshkash ko vidhi ayog ne sire se nakaar diya he
 The government was entitled to confine the contempt of court to only court proceedings and proceedings, but leave the court, even the Law Commission ignored the government's talk
 adaalaton kii avmananako nyaayalayon tak hi simit rakhane ke masale par vidhi ayog ne sarkaar ko apni report saunpi he
 The government sought an opinion from the Law Commission about amending and limiting the definition of contempt of court into law
 sarkaar ko bheji report main vidhi ayog ne kaha he kisupreme courtor hycourt kii avhelnaa karne waalon ke khilaaf karrwai kii shakti samvidhan ke anuchhed 129 or 215 ke tahat adaalat yani nyaaypalika ko mili hui he
 This is necessary to maintain fear among the elements or people who insult the court and if it is limited, incidents of contempt will increase
 kanoon main sanshodhan kar nyaayalay kii shakti kam nahin kii ja sakati
 In fact, the Justice Department of the Law Ministry had asked the Commission to investigate an amendment to the Contempt Act 1971 to limit the definition of contempt only to willful disobedience of court decisions or guidelines
 vibhaag ne saath hi anya upbandh 'aapraadhik avmaananaa' ko hataane ko kaha tha jisamen adaalat par anaap-shanaap aarope lagaana shaamil he
 The Commission said in a report, the suggestion to remove the provision relating to criminal contempt would have no effect on the authority of the upper courts (supreme Court and High Court) in view of their inherent constitutional powers as these powers are different from statutory provisions
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki bharat ko apane parmaanu aprasar ricard par garv he or yah vyapak jansanhaar ke sabhi hathiyaaron ke prasar ko rokane ke vaishvik prayaason ke liye patibaddh he

 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki vaishvik parmaanu aprasar vyavastha parmaanu prasar ko rokane main safal nahin hui he
 He said that if we manage the three phases of the nuclear program, by 2050, India can generate four lakh 70 thousand MW of electricity
 pareekshan par ekatarfa roak ke liye patibaddhek sammelan ke dauraan pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ek parmaanu shakti sampann raashtra or antarrashtriya samudaay kaa jimmedaar sadsy hone ke naate bharat nirastrikaran sammelan main emmemasiti ko lekar charchaa main srujanaatmak bhagidaari karegaa

 Rane said on the phone, 'there are two types of fishermen in Sindhudurg
 ek wo jo machhlee pakadaney ke liye paaramparik tareekon kaa istemaal karte hai or duusare wo jo aadhunik takanic kaa istemaal karte hai
 He said that according to the rules of the state government, the fishing areas for both the communities have been clearly demarcated
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki aadhunik tareeke se machhlee pakadaney vaale machuaare paaramparik tareeke se machhlee pakadaney vaale machuaaron ke ilaake main aksar ghuste hai jisase unhen nuksaan hota he
 Rane said, 'we spoke to the fisheries commissioner of Sindhudurg and brought to the notice of the government's proposal of February 4, 2016 clearly stating the rules for fishermen of both communities
 ' unhone kaha, 'matsaypalan ayukta ke jaise adhikariyon ke nazarandaaj karne vaale ravaiye ke kaaran in niyamon ko lagu karne ke liye kuch nahin kiya ja rahaa he jiske kaaran paaramparik machuaaron ko baari nuksaan jhelana pad rahaa he
 Rane, son of senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Narayan Rane, claimed that fishermen from neighboring states also enter the watershed of Maharashtra, adding to the problems of traditional fishermen
 unhone kaha, 'in muddon ko hal karne ke liye koi kadam nahin uthaaya gaya paaramparik machuaaron ke saath lambey samay se anyaay ho rahaa he isliye hamen aaj aakraamak kadam uthaanaa padaa
 The MLA had recently quipped on the Shiv Sena that the Uddhav Thackeray-led party should find a place in the Guinness World Records for abandoning (but not doing so) the bjp-led Maharashtra government several times

 The MLA from Kankavali in coastal Sindhudurg district said that he did so in protest against the commissioner's alleged 'neglectful attitude' towards the problems of the traditional fishermen community of the Konkan region

 One who uses traditional methods for fishing and the other who uses modern technology
 ' unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar ke niyamon ke mutabik, donon samudaayon ke liye machhlee pakadaney ke ilaakon kaa spasht taur par simakan kiya gaya he
 He alleged that modern-day fishermen often enter the area of fishermen fishing in the traditional way, causing damage to them

 unhone aarope lagaaya ki aadhunik tareeke se machhlee pakadaney vaale machuaare paaramparik tareeke se machhlee pakadaney vaale machuaaron ke ilaake main aksar ghuste hai jisase unhen nuksaan hota he
 Rane said, 'we spoke to the fisheries commissioner of Sindhudurg and brought to the notice of the government's proposal of February 4, 2016 clearly stating the rules for fishermen of both communities
 ' unhone kaha, 'matsaypalan ayukta ke jaise adhikariyon ke nazarandaaj karne vaale ravaiye ke kaaran in niyamon ko lagu karne ke liye kuch nahin kiya ja rahaa he jiske kaaran paaramparik machuaaron ko baari nuksaan jhelana pad rahaa he
 Rane, son of senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Narayan Rane, claimed that fishermen from neighboring states also enter the watershed of Maharashtra, adding to the problems of traditional fishermen
 unhone kaha, 'in muddon ko hal karne ke liye koi kadam nahin uthaaya gaya paaramparik machuaaron ke saath lambey samay se anyaay ho rahaa he isliye hamen aaj aakraamak kadam uthaanaa padaa
 The MLA had recently quipped on the Shiv Sena that the Uddhav Thackeray-led party should find a place in the Guinness World Records for abandoning (but not doing so) the bjp-led Maharashtra government several times

 "he said," Due to the neglectful attitude of officials like Fisheries Commissioner, nothing is being done to implement these rules, due to which traditional fishermen are suffering heavy losses
 ' varisht congress netaa or purv mukhyamantri narayan rane ke bete rane ne daawa kiya ki padosi rajya ke machuaare bhi maharashtra ke jalakshetra main ghuste hai jisase paaramparik machuaaron kii pareshaani bad jaati he

 There are many contradictions in the BJP manifesto
 ek taraf wo kehete hai ki ham tex kam karenge, duusari taraf wo kehete hai ki ham tex collection ko badhayenge
 The truth is that there has been a decrease in the collection of GST
 'iske alaava congress ne kaha, 'ek taraf bhaajapa kahati he ki rajmargon kii lambaai doguni kar denge, vahiin duusari taraf kahati he ki agle paanch saal main 60,000 kimi rajmarg banaaenge

 Today, when the film news reached Totoli, it was seen that the first day box office collection of Sunny Leone's 'kuch Kuchi Locha Hai' released this week was around 50 lakhs
 yani sani leyoni kii film kaa hashr bahut bura tha
 Such a fate can be of any star and any film at the box office
 magar sawaal ye he kii sani leyoni ab kisase shikaayat karengi? kya wo darshakon se kahengi ki unki puraani image kii vajah se darshak unki film dekhnaa nahin chaahate? wo kah bhi sakati hai kyonki pichley dinon kai baar subah-subah akhbaaron kii surkhiyon main maine dekha, jisamen sani ne kabhi news channel ke bare main kaha ki 'kuch channel meraa intervyuu nahin karnaa chaahate kyonki main porn star rah chuki hum
 ' ek din to maine akhbaar main sani kii ye bhi shikaayat padhi kii sani ke saath bahut saare star kaam nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 Now is this complaint of Sunny justified? Not at all from my point of view, because journalists in India and the media made a lot of headlines for Sunny
 bharat ke channel ne hi unhen big bos main bulaakar bharat ke ghar-ghar main pahunchaaya
 It is a fact that Sunny is known as the porn star around the world, but the audience of India saw her differently and accepted, in which the media also supported Sunny
 vahiin duusari taraf sani kii ye bhi shikaayat he ki bollywood ke kai sitare unke saath kaam karnaa nahin chaahate or mujhe unki ye shikaayat bhi jaays nahin lagati
 Because even the biggest actresses in Bollywood are not able to work with all the stars many times
 in dinon kangana ranut bahut bulandi par hai magar kangana ne kisi bhi khan ke saath kaam nahin kiya
 Vidya Balan is a big actress till 2 years ago or even now, but she too did not get a film with any Khan and there are dozens of such examples
 ab kangana or vidya kya or kisase shikaayat karen?tippaniyan Every year, hundreds of girls come to Mumbai to become heroines in the city of Mumbai and either go back with dreams in their eyes or start traveling on another track
 aisi darjanon ladkiyaan is shahar main har rose dikhaai detii hai jo heroin banane kii jaddojahad karti hai par unki jagah filmon main 1 yaa 2 seen se zyaada nahin hoti magar sani ke saath aisa nahin hua
 Filmmakers like Mahesh Bhatt, Sanjay Gupta and Ekta Kapoor cast him in their films without any discrimination
 aise main sani ko ye sochna chahie kii pornster hone ke baavjood bhi bharat or bollywood ne unhen apanaaya
 Honor given respect and separate recognition
 baaki koun si film kis star ke saath milti he yaa koun si film hit hoti he ye sab kismat kaa khel he
 So Sunny should not complain to Mumbai but thank her
 box offis par aisa hashr kisi bhi star or kisi bhi film kaa ho saktaa he
 But the question is, who will Sunny Leoni complain to now? Will she tell the audience that the audience does not want to see her film because of her old image? She can also say that because in the past several times in the morning i saw in the headlines of newspapers, in which Sunny never said about the news channel, 'some channels do not want to interview me because i have been a porn star
 ' One day i even read Sunny's complaint in the newspaper that a lot of stars do not want to work with Sunny
 ab kya sani kii ye shikaayat jaays he? mere najariye se bilkul bhi nahin, kyonki bharat ke patrakaron ne or media ne sani ko khub surkhiyaan di
 It was the channel of India that called him in Big Boss and brought him to the doorstep of India
 ye hakeekat he ki sani vishvabhar main porn star ke naam se jaani jaati hai magar bharat ke darshakon ne unhen is rup se alag dekha or sweekaara, jisamen media ne bhi khub saath diya sani kaa
 On the other hand, Sunny has also complained that many Bollywood stars do not want to work with him and i do not like this complaint of his
 kyonki bollywood main badi se badi abhinetri bhi sabhi stars ke saath kai baar kaam nahin kar paati
 These days Kangana Ranaut is very high but Kangana did not work with any Khan
 vidya baalan 2 saal pehle tak yaa ab bhi badi abhinetri hai magar inhen bhi kisi khan ke saath film nahin mili or aisi darjanon misaalen hai
 Now Kangna and Vidya complain to whom and to whom? Comments mumbai nagari main har saal saikadon ladkiyaan heroin banane aati hai or ankhon main sapane liye yaa to waapas jaati hai yaa kisi or patari par safar shuru kar detii hai
 Dozens of girls appear every day in this city who struggle to become heroines, but they do not have more than 1 or 2 scenes in films but this did not happen with Sunny
 bina kisi bhedbhaav ke mahesh bhatta, sanjay gupta or ekta kapur jaise filmkaaron ne inhen apni filmon main cast kiya
 In such a situation, Sunny should think that despite being a pornstar, India and Bollywood adopted her
 maan sammaan or alag pahchaan diya
 The rest of which film meets with which star or which film is a hit is all a game of luck
 isliye sani ko mumbai se shikaayat nahin balki shukriya adaa karnaa chahie
 One day i even read Sunny's complaint in the newspaper that a lot of stars do not want to work with Sunny
 ab kya sani kii ye shikaayat jaays he? mere najariye se bilkul bhi nahin, kyonki bharat ke patrakaron ne or media ne sani ko khub surkhiyaan di

 ye hakeekat he ki sani vishvabhar main porn star ke naam se jaani jaati hai magar bharat ke darshakon ne unhen is rup se alag dekha or sweekaara, jisamen media ne bhi khub saath diya sani kaa

 ab kangana or vidya kya or kisase shikaayat karen?tippaniyan Every year, hundreds of girls come to Mumbai to become heroines in the city of Mumbai and either go back with dreams in their eyes or start traveling on another track
 aisi darjanon ladkiyaan is shahar main har rose dikhaai detii hai jo heroin banane kii jaddojahad karti hai par unki jagah filmon main 1 yaa 2 seen se zyaada nahin hoti magar sani ke saath aisa nahin hua
 Filmmakers like Mahesh Bhatt, Sanjay Gupta and Ekta Kapoor cast him in their films without any discrimination
 aise main sani ko ye sochna chahie kii pornster hone ke baavjood bhi bharat or bollywood ne unhen apanaaya
 Honor given respect and separate recognition
 baaki koun si film kis star ke saath milti he yaa koun si film hit hoti he ye sab kismat kaa khel he
 So Sunny should not complain to Mumbai but thank her
 mumbai nagari main har saal saikadon ladkiyaan heroin banane aati hai or ankhon main sapane liye yaa to waapas jaati hai yaa kisi or patari par safar shuru kar detii hai
 Dozens of girls appear every day in this city who struggle to become heroines, but they do not have more than 1 or 2 scenes in films but this did not happen with Sunny
 bina kisi bhedbhaav ke mahesh bhatta, sanjay gupta or ekta kapur jaise filmkaaron ne inhen apni filmon main cast kiya
 In such a situation, Sunny should think that despite being a pornstar, India and Bollywood adopted her
 maan sammaan or alag pahchaan diya
 The rest of which film meets with which star or which film is a hit is all a game of luck
 isliye sani ko mumbai se shikaayat nahin balki shukriya adaa karnaa chahie

 agar koi kami ho to turant durust kiya ja sake kyonki abhi bhi saat se aath maheene kaa samay he
 No matter how brilliantly you enjoy sex, but to live it to its fullest, playing your role in the bed, that is, after sex, your reaction is also very important
 aap kaa vyavhaar role nibhaane ke turant baad kaisaa hota he
 Somewhere you do not sleep without turning or stick directly to the TV remote
 kabhi is ore dhyaan dijie or apane role nibhaane se pehle, sex ke dauraan or is ke thik baad ke apane vyavhaar ko khud parakhie
 Even after spending tasty moments in the bed, you can remain close to your partner and full of love moments
 clinical sexologist rechil roj kaa kahana he ki shaareerik sambandh main charmotkarsh paane ke baad hormones main kisi ke saath sachche man se judane kii kshamta bad jaati he
 But this does not mean that you just look into each other's eyes or just talk
 vaise yah donon vikalp bhi bure nahin hai, lekin agar kuch hat kar or nayaa prayog kiya jaae, to kya kehane
 In the moments after sex, extend yourself to keep yourself physically and emotionally connected to your partner, just eight steps with us
 
 
 1 agar apana role nibhaane ke turant baad hi aap ko bhukh lagati he, to rasoi main jaakar bachaa khaanaa talashne yaa bazaar se kuch order dene ke bajaae soft drink kaa majaa bhi lijie, isse aap ko milegaa relexeshan
 So what is the delay that you are not taking soft drinks after sex this time
 2 sex ke baad mahaj vashroom main jaakar fresh hone ke baje apane saathi ke saath ek mjedaar shower kaa apshan aap ko romanchit kar degaa
 Touch each other while taking a bath and give a light fun massage to sensitive parts of the body
 yakeen maniye yah shower aap donon ko bahut kareeb laa degaa
 3 There is no doubt that the relationship that satisfies later exhausts
 lekin agar aap jaraa sa dimag lagaayenge, to yah thakaan bhi aap ko apane saathi ke kareeb le jaaegi
 Instead of getting away from each other after a physical relationship, rest your feet on your partner's feet and also keep your head on their chest
 is se ek duusare ke saath kaa jo anubhav aap ko hoga, vah pehle kabhi nahin hua hoga
 4 Give your relationship at the same time
 aap ke dimag main koi duusari baat yaa internet kaa keeda clic na kar paae, isliye physical hone se pehle hi apane leptop, phone yaa tivi jaisi har cheez kaa batan switch of kar den
 5 You can enjoy sex without being physical
 kabhi jindagi ke palon ko ek hi bistar par chhedhkhani karne yaa masti karte hue sambandh banaae bina bitaa kar dekhen, aap ek nai urja se bhar uthenge
 6 When you have enjoyed the exciting moments, spend some time together in the light of the lights in the room
 yakeenan yah behad romantic mahasoos hoga
 After 7 physical relationships, if you wear your nightie yourself, then this time leave it lying
 nity ke bajaae apane saathi ko kapade pahanane main madad karen or unhen chhod dijie aap kii
 To wear nighty
 ek duusare ko kapade pahanaate hue aap donon kii nazdikiyaan or bad jaaengi
 8 Create a folder of romantic songs on your phone or ipod
 koi bhi ek aisa gaanaa chune, jo aap donon ko romchint kar detaa ho
 Enjoy it together by driving it
 ek duusare ke saath bitaye un palon ko yaad karen, jo aap donon ke liye yaadgaar hon

 25 disambar 2010 kii subah 10
 At 30 am, the scientists were breathing at isro's Mission Control Center in Sriharikota
 jieselvi-epa06 rocket par sanchaar upgrah jisat-5pi rakhaa tha
 Exactly four minutes later 10
 34 baje rocket ko launch kiya gaya
 But, 53 of the launch
 8 second baad logon ne dekha ki rocket dhamaake ke saath aasmaan main dhwast ho gaya
 Disappearance fell on the faces of people and scientists
 isro ko kareeb 325 karod (175 karod kaa jieselvi-epa06 or 150 karod rupee kaa jisat-5pi) kaa nuksaan hua tha
 Also, the months of hard work of thousands of scientists wasted
 haalanki, is baat ko behad kam log jaanate hai ki isro vaigyanikon kaa kaam sirf rocket launch karnaa hi nahin he
 If the rocket deviates from the direction or it sees any major flaw after the flight, it is also his responsibility to blast it in the air
 2010 main bhi jieselvi-epa06 ko isi tarah launch ke baad hawa main dhwast kar diya gaya tha
 Let us tell you about the former ISRO scientist who finished this rocket in the air
 taaki, disha se bhramit ho rahe rocket se jaan-maal kaa nuksaan na ho
 Letter from ISRO Scientists: We are shocked and very sad
 
 
 isro ke itihaas main rocket ko hawa main dhwast karne ke 2 hi maamle hai
 The first in 2006 and the second in 2010
 is rocket scientist ne purv raashtrapati or vaigyanik, bharat ratna divangat dow
 Along with APJ Abdul Kalam, he worked as a safety officer in the launch of Agni missile
 inkaa naam he- vinod kumaar shrivastav
 AAJTAK
 IN se vishesh baatcheet main unhone apane jivan, kaam, uplabdhiyon or dukh ke kai rochak kisse bayaan kiye
 Through these interesting stories, know how an ISRO scientist does his work
 
 
 
 Vinod Kumar Srivastava, former ISRO Range Safety Officer
 '5-7 second main rocket ko dhwast karne kaa faisla liya tha maine'jab jieselvi-epa06 kii lonching honi thi tab main satish dhawan spes centre main range sefti officer tha
 My job was rocket and range safety
 main bataa duun ki yahaan sefti kaa matlab suraksha nahin he
 Scientists call it 'safety'
 yani kisi avaanchhneeya parinaam se bachaav
 47 after the launch of GSLV-F06
 5 second tak sab thik tha
 47
 8 second main hamen uski disha main gadabadi dikhaai di
 After this, the number of flaws in the rocket started increasing rapidly
 vah disha badal rahaa tha
 We get the first information about the way, health and imperfections of the rocket in one tenth of a second
 Chandrayaan-2 kii chamak se china bhi chakit, agle mishan main chahta he bharat kii madaagar vah kahin girtaa to bada nuksaan ho saktaa tha
 Therefore, i 53
 8 second main distroction kaa cmand diya
 i said command executed
 tab range oparation diarector ne kaha- roger
 Then a detailed report of the then ISRO chairman
 radhakrishnanan ko saunpi gai
 The entire mission control center was in silence
 main khud hairaan tha ki mujhe rocket ko dhwast karnaa pad rahaa he
 It hurts to do this
 lekin, hamaare liye logon kii jaan behad jaruri hoti he
 Because there is a major flaw in the rocket after going into the air, it becomes clear that the mission is not being successful
 vah kisi ko nuksaan pahunchaae, usase pehle use nasht kar do
 After this, i made a report of this work and submitted it to the high command of ISRO
 usamen maine bataaya ki kin paristhitiyon main rocket ko dhwast karnaa padaa
 And the airstrike will be accurate, till the enemy's hand clock will see all the areas that come in the way of India's satellite rocket
 Vinod Kumar Srivastava said that the rocket is studied before leaving it
 uske raste ke neeche aane vaale ilaakon or vahaan rahane vaali aabaadi kii detail lee jaati he
 Before the launch, the National Hydrographic Office in Dehradun and the Civil Aviation Department in Delhi are told the rocket route
 ye donon sanghathan launch ke pehle samudr or hawa main maujuud jahaaj or vimaan ko isaki soochna dete hai
 So that they stay in their path safely or make a little change
 saath hi rocket ke raste main aane vaale ilaakon ke prashasan ko soochna di jaati he
 It is launched when both of them tell us that one hour before the launch is all OK
 aamtaur par koshish yahi rahati he ki rocket ke raste main koi shahar na aae
 But oil rigs, oil tankers, ships etc
 from Sriharikota to Andaman and Nicobar have to be had
 jinhen launch se pehle soochna de di jaati he
 In ISRO for 29 years, before that worked with Kalam Saheb in DRDO, Vinod Kumar Srivastava said that he completed his 12th education from Government Inter College, Kanpur
 phir viesesadi college kanpur se hi emessi kiya
 After this, he was a lecturer in chemistry at Feroze Gandhi College Rae Bareli for a short time
 is bich, pune sthit diardio ke explosive research and deveopment lab main vaigyanik kii job lag gai
 Then worked on a ground-to-air missile at the DRDO center in Hyderabad
 ise devil mishan naam diya gaya tha
 Got a chance to work with him for 6 months under the leadership of Kalam Saheb
 balasore main shuruaati teen agni mixilon main kalam sahab ko acist kiya
 Joined ISRO as a safety officer in the launch of the fourth rocket of SLV-3
 ritairement tak 450 rocket kaa prakshepan karaayaa
 Demolition of just one rocket, how to help a farmer from the land to the farm farmer, retired in ISRO2011, but did not want to lose his experience
 Vinod Kumar Srivastava in 2011 from Satish Dhawan Space Center at Sriharikota, ISRO as GM Range Safety Retired
 lekin isro inke anubhav ko khona nahin chahta tha isliye unhen ek saal tak brahmaprakash vaigyanik kii shrenee main rahe
 Since then Vinod Kumar Srivastava has been a Scientific Advisor to Category-1 in ISRO for 4 years
 abhi isro ke overol rivyuu cameti ke sadsy hai jo launch ke pehle sabhi prakriyaaon kaa rivyuu karti he
 Now, commentary on the launch of ISRO in Hindi
 ab isro ke lonching kii karte hai hindi main camentry, taaki log aasaani se samaj saken19 disambar 2018 ko jieselvi-epa11 / jisat-7e kii lonching se pehle vinod kumaar shrivastav se isro ke range oparation diarector ne kaha ki shrivastav ji hamaara hindi camentator aaj nahin aayaa he
 You will do Hindi commentary on the launching
 tab vinod kumaar shrivastav ne is ofer ko tatkaal maan liya
 Since then, Vinod Kumar Srivastava has commented on Hindi launching on five occasions
 chandrayan-2 ke lonching kii hindi camentry bhi vinod kumaar shrivastav ke kandhon par thi
 Chandrayaan-2 rocket gslv-mk3 used fuel up to the last drop
 Vinod Kumar Srivastava said that the successful launch of Chandrayaan-2 on 22 July was because the GSLV-AK3 rocket performed well
 rocket ke chalane kaa jo ganit isro vaigyanikon ne lagaaya tha, usase 18 second zyada chalaa
 It went 6000 km ahead of the boundary
 kyonki ise lambey safar par janaa tha, isliye vaigyanikon ne ise roka nahin
 Going ahead of the rocket has saved Chandrayaan-2 fuel
 jo aage phydemand hogi

 sumit ne baaki tamaam contestants kii tarah 10 hajaar kaa aankada to badi aasaani se paar kar liya
 He used his first lifeline on the Rs 20,000 question
 ye lifline thi audiyans pole
 On the question of 1 lakh 60 thousand rupees, Sumit took two more lifelines
 ye sawaal tha, "kis bhartiya parivaar ne hero cikals ki shuruyaat kii thi?" iskaa sahi jawaab tha munjal parivaar
 Even after Sumit won Rs 3 lakh 20 thousand, he still had a lifeline left
 jab vah apana doosraa padaav paar karne ke baad 6 lakh 40 hajaar rupee ke sawaal par pahunche to unhen iskaa sahi jawaab nahin maaloom tha
 The question was, "if men play Thomas Cup badminton, what event do women complete?" The correct answer was Uber Cup
 sumit ne iskaa galat jawaab diya or vah 3 lakh 20 hajaar rupee kii dhanrashi jitkar ghar gaye
 These gifts will be available in Diwali Week - Amitabh told in Monday's episode that this Diwali Week is going on and hence every contestant coming on the show will be given a silver coin and Oppo phone gifts
 sumit ko bhi amitabh bachchan ne ek phone or chaandi kaa sikaa tohfe main diya
 The agenda of political parties in the name of news is the truth of today's journalism and the misfortune of you audience
 jo log news channelon par naukariyon ke sawaal or aspataalon main premium opidi ke naam par lut kii khabaren dekhnaa chaahate hai unhen meri ek salaah he
 
 wo kuch din berojgaar rahane kaa sabar karen or aspataal jo maange wo de den, kyonki abhi channelon ko raajnneetik dalon kaa agenda puraa karnaa he
 Many students who are preparing for railway exams have been contacting the news channels since many days to see if their jobs have been cut drastically
 chaatr agar rail mantri ke twitor handle par puch lete to kya pataa sahi baat kaa pataa chal jaataa
 No matter what preparation you do, a leader's statement or stunt flies across the TV screen
 kai baar bataaya he, phir se bataa rahaa hum
 
 
 Now there is not much time left
 sutron ke hawaale se khabaren aa rahi hai ki chunaav ayog jaldi hi raajnneetik dalon or unke dwaara chune hue technology export ko mauka dene vaala he
 They go to any state
 
 From there choose a machine of any booth
 use dilli laayaa jayega or phir hack karke dikhaa den
 It is named Hackathon
 ayog ne elaan nahin kiya he, magar hekathon jab charchaa main aa hi gaya he to oxford dictionari ke anusaar hekathon matlab jaan lete hai
 The hackathon is an event lasting several days or several hours, with a large number of people coming in, working for a computer programming
 milakar banaate hai yaa bigaad bhi sakate hai
 This is called a hackathon
 mere hisaab se iviem mashin ke sandarbh main iskaa naam bhartiya paramparanukool hona chahie
 The hack should be called Swayamvar
 ham sketch ke zariye bataane kaa prayaas karenge ki agar hua to bharat kaa pehla hack swayamvar kaisaa hoga
 Now-a-days it is being heard that old history is being written and new is being written
 meri itani guzarish he ki jo panne khaali hai vahaan kisi kone main meraa naam bhi likh diya jaae, kyonki hack swayamvar kii kalpana sabase pehle maine kii he
 Rather, i also tell you what to write
 jis daur main news ankaron kaa blad pressure vayumandal ke dabaav se paar chalaa gaya tha, us vakt ek ankar shantchitt hack swayamvar kii kalpana main laga tha
 Let us enter the fantasy world of hack swayamvar
 hekathon main 16 dalon ke technology vir aaenge
 The biggest headache for these parties will be to convince a capable hacker who can hack and show evms
 ab haikar par nirbhar karegaa ki wo badale main us dal se kitni fees legaa
 Whoever can hack the EVM and show it will win the swayamvara to save Indian democracy
 uske gale main maala daal di jaaegi
 If someone came out of the Hack Swayamvar Room without being hacked, he would make fun of his team across the country, on whose behalf he went to the Hack Hall
 
 
 thik vaise hi jaise ramanand sagar ke ramayana serial main sita swayamvar ke drishy main dhanush na uthaa sakane vaale raja jab waapas ladkadaane lagate the to hansi kii gunj becoground main sunai detii thi
 Therefore, it is better that political parties think from now whether to send their hacker to hackathon
 meri raay main haikar ke chunaav ke liye unhen bhi apane yahaan hamethon karana chahie
 Matter is very serious
 tippaniyan The Election Commission not only has to deal with 16 political parties on the electronic machine, but the court orders also have to be kept in mind
 uttarakhand main hoicourt ne saat vidhansabha kshetron main istemaal hui electronic mashiinon ko zabt karne ke aadesh die hai
 It is alleged that a BJP leader had predicted the number of votes which party would get regarding the many booths on Facebook post, which turned out to be almost right
 ek aarope he ki jis booth par jo mashine bheji gayi thim, unki suchi ke anusaar, poling booth par mashine nahin thim
 
 
 Others were machines
 hoicourt ne chunaav ayog, rajya nirvachan ayog ko notice diya he
 Not only this, the Bombay High Court has ordered a forensic examination of EVM of Parbati Assembly of Pune
 2014 main hue vidhansabha chunaav kaa yah maamla he
 This order seems to have happened for the first time
 bombai hoicourt ne 9 sawaal bhi puche hai ki
 
 
 Can an EVM be equipped with an electronic device that can be operated via Bluetooth or infrared
 kya iviem main koi memory chip daali ja sakati he
 Forensic lab of Hyderabad will have forensic examination of all the machines of Parbati assembly
 dilli nagar nigam chunaavon ke baad laga tha ki aam aadmi party bhi baaki dalon kii tarah iviem ke masale se kinaaraa kar legi, magar vidhansabha main apane hisaab se ek mashin banaakar le aae or apane code number se bataaya ki electronic voting mashin se chhedchhad kii ja sakati he
 It has to be kept in mind that the machine that MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj introduced is not an EVM
 
 Nor does it resemble him
 kumaar vishwaas ne saurabh bharadwaj kii tarif kii he or kumaar vishwaas ke samarthak maane jane vaale kapil mishra ne aalochana kii he or kaha he ki unke aaropon se dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye yah sab kiya gaya he
 BJP has said that evms have been resorted to to avoid the questions which were being raised on Kejriwal
 is bich is maamle par chunaav ayog kii pratikriya aa gai he
 
 
 The Election Commission says that anyone can bring such a similar machine
 
 
 ye iviem jaisi mashin he, iviem nahin
 And it is not important
 aisi mashiinon se manachaahe nattejey mil sakate hai
 While the Election Commission's evms are completely safe
 aisi mashiinon se EVM ko badnaam nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Election Commission will give the details of security in the meeting of 12 May
