 Imagine if all your social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram, whatsapp, Snapchat and Twitter stop working for a certain period of time, would you be worried, nervous or calm? This year there were several occasions in India when social media apps remained closed for many hours or did not work properly
 ise takanic kii bhashaa main ap kaa 'down ho janaa' kehete hai
 Users had to resort to Twitter in such a situation, because this was the only social media app that did not go down and mostly worked
 mumbai ke 21 varshiya college chaatr dipanshu jain ne ieenes se kaha, "outage (down) hamen yah ehsaas karaate hai ki ham vastav main internet or ap par kitna nirbhar hai
 People also have apps that remind them that it is time to drink water
 agar ye ap kaam karnaa band kar de, to vyakti kii bechaini kii kalpana kii ja sakati he
 The social media outage makes me uncomfortable and restless
 "fasebuk ke sabhi eps main se instagram sabase zyada downtime kaa anubhav karata he
 On March 14, Facebook Apps suffered an outage for 12 hours at its longest
 jabaki logon ne sibar hamalon kii sambhaavnaaon kaa anumaan lagaaya, soshal netwarking kii diggaj company ne atakalon kaa khandan kiya or iske blassout ke liye 'sarwar pun: sangyojan' ko doshi tehraaya
 There will be restlessness in this way - if your anxiety also increases when social media platforms like Facebook and whatsapp are down, then start working on some things from now
 -soshal media par apana active time kam karne kaa prayaas karen
 - First of all, resort to other information systems to communicate with friends
 - ghar main parijanon ke saath baatcheet se lekar bhojan karte vakt soshal media par kam active rahen
 - Use less social networking sites while sleeping at night
 - soshal media se dhyaan hataane ke liye duusari dilachasp chizon main dhyaan lagaaein
 High profile and extremely shocking names have come out in the house of CBI director Ranjit Sinha
 ranjit sinha ke dilli sthit ghar par 2013 se 2014 ke bich aae logon kaa lekha-jokha 310 pannon main maujuud he
 There are a lot of names among them, which the CBI is investigating or has done in the past
 angreji akhbaar 'da indian express' ne may 2013 se agast 2014 tak ranjit sinha ke ghar aae logon kii padtaal kii he
 Those coming to Sinha's home range from coal and 2G scam accused to former Union Minister Salman Khurshid and Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda

 Investigation is going on in the 2G spectrum scam case against Reliance officials
 guuruuvaar ko maamle par sunwaayee he
 In addition to the MP scam accused of coal scam, who reached five times, many 'controversial' people often used to come to Ranjit Sinha's house
 inamen congress saansad vijay vijay darada or unke bete devendra darada shaamil hai
 Both of these names are included in the chargesheet filed in the coal allocation scam in March 2014
 may 2013 se agast 2014 ke bich vijay darada paanch baar sibiai pramukh ke ghar pahunche
 2G beneficiaries reached 71 barcbi chief's house most visited by HFCL Group promoter Mahendra Nahata, alleged beneficiary of 2G scam
 in 15 maheenon main vah 71 baar baar sibiai pramukh ke ghar pahunche
 When the English newspaper contacted Nahata, he said, 'ranjit Sinha is my family friend and i have known him for two decades
 main bataur dost kuch-ek baar unase mila, lekin mujhe nahin pataa ki yah 71 kaa aankada kahaan se aayaa
 As a friend, i will keep meeting him even further
 'deepak talwaar kaa bhi nameek or chaunkaane vaala naam he deepak talwaar kaa
 Deepak is a consultant whose name had cropped up in the Neera Radia tape
 vah 54 baar sibiai chif ke ghar pahunche
 Let me tell you that this is the same sword against which the CBI started the investigation, but soon stopped it
 meet vyapaaree moin kuraishi bhi shamilanaamon kii fehrist main ek or vivaadaaspad naam moin kuraishi kaa he
 Remember that it is the same Moin Qureshi whose relationship with former CBI President AP Singh was disputed
 2013 se 2014 ke bich vah 70 baar ranjit sinha se milane pahunche
 The last time he reached the house of CBI Chief was on 12 August
 kai baar to vah sinha ke ghar ek din main do baar pahunche or kai baar unki patni bhi saath thim
 It was written in the register, 'nahata ji' Akhbar has written that he tried to contact Vijay Darada, Talwar and Qureshi, but they could not be available for comment
 entry ke register main kai jagahon par 'nahata ji' or 'kuraishi ji' likhaa he, jisase pataa chalata he ki get par tainaat police vaale unke akasar aane jane se parichit the
 Ranjit Sinha, while clarifying the Budhwar who was also involved in the former Delhi Police Commissioner, said that he used to work as an office from home
 lekin hairat kii baat he ki unke ghar aane waalon kii suchi main bamushkil kisi sibiai adhikari kaa naam he
 There is no indication from the entry book that office work was also done from home
 balki register se pataa chalata he ki june 2013 main purv videsh mantri salmaan khurshid bhi der raat ranjit sinha ke ghar pahunche
 In February 2014, former minister Subodh Kant Sahai also visited his house
 haryana ke mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda or dilli police ke purv kamishnar niraj kumaar do baar sibiai pramukh ke ghar pahunche
 The newspaper has written that when Khurshid was asked about this meeting, he said that he had a 'government job'
 ye log sibiai chif se milane pahunche isamen koi shaq nahin he, kyonki get par darj kiye gaye vaahanon ke number unke maalikon ke naam se mail khate hai
 My privacy was violated: Sinhasinha told the newspaper, 'the truth and authenticity of the register figures needs to be established
 yah meri niztaa kaa hanan he
 Yes, people like Deepak Talwar and Devendra Darada came to my house
 to kya hua? agar vah apana paksh rakhane ke liye mujhase milanaa chaahate hai, to main kya manaa kar duungaa?'sinha ne aarope lagaaya ki entry register par naam or vaahanon ke number ripet kiye gaye hai or log itani zyada baar unke ghar nahin aae
 The CBI chief said, 'moin Qureshi still comes to my house, ever since he is troubled by a dispute regarding the CBI
 isi tarah, deepak talwaar apane airport project se judi dikkaton par baat karne aate the
 But why would these people come to my house every day? for which reason? Someone who is doing mischief

 According to the Straits Times news, the chairman of the government-appointed inquiry committee to investigate the December riots has recommended that police should keep a 'stick' with them to deal with such protests on the street
 singapore ke dainik akhbaar ne jaanch samiti ke adhyaksh ji pannir selvam ke hawaale se kaha, 'haalanki aapke paas bandook he, iskaa istemaal na karen or lathi zyada upyogi sabit ho sakati he
 Selvam was speaking at a public hearing yesterday about how the police initially dealt with the riots that occurred on the night of December 8 last year
 selvam ne police sah-adheekshak jonathan teng ko bataaya, 'jab aap dangon vaali jagah jaaen to aapke paas sirf raksha upkaran nahin hona chahie
 Tang was telling them how the police officers who were the first to reach the scene of the incident in Little India dealt with the riots
 sunwaayee ke dauraan sakshya pesh karte hue eespi teng ne kaha ki suraksha kaarnon or paas khadey logon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue dangaiyon par goli nahin chalaai gai
 Tang said that dropping the shell would have made the crowd remember that the police had weapons and that the rioters could have attacked the police officers and taken away the weapons
 unhone kaha ki lekin police ke hathiyaaron main tii-byton the
 They are designed as a defensive tool and are effective in close attacks
 tab selvam ne teng se poocha ki kya ve ‘lathi’ ke bare main jaanate hai? teng ko apni baat samajhane ke liye is sevanivrutt nyaayadhish ne adhikari ko bhartiya akhbaar kii ek prati di, jisamen bhartiya police sansad ke baahar hone vaale haalia virodh pradarshan se nipatane ke liye ‘lathi’ kaa istemaal karti dikhaai de rahi he
 According to the news, since the Jansunwai started last Wednesday by the Inquiry Committee, three times the Selwam rioters have raised the use of 'lathi' to suppress the mob
 pichley shuukravaar unhone police upayukta tii raja kumaar se sifarish kii thi ki singapore police bal ko apane paas ye upkaran (lathi) rakhni chahie
 The inquiry committee found during the hearing that the people in the rioting crowd were far more than the policemen and officers at the scene tried to maintain violence in Little India

 Gurudas Kamat Jharoo-pochha always helps in cleaning
 but nobody can clean your sick & dirty mind @kamatgurudas@smritiirani@vijai63 On 14 February 2014, the Aam Aadmi Party, which formed the government in Delhi for the first time, relinquished 49 days of power
 thik ek saal baad 14 farvari 2015 ko ramlila maidan main arvind kejariwal ne phir se mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee or sarkaar banaai
 But this time the government was different from the previous 49 days
 naa 'aap' ko ab congress kii baisakhi kii jarurat thi or naa hi har faisle ke liye janamat kii aavashyaktaa rah gai thi kyonki jeet 70 main se 67 siton par mili thi, yani janata puri tarah se 'aap' par nyochaavar
 Now 14 February once again, but this time the first anniversary of the AAP government is being celebrated, not the compulsion to leave
 vaade, vivaad or kejariwal sarkaarkejariwal sarkaar 2014 main bani modi sarkaar kii tarah ek lokapriy sarkaar ke rup main ubhari
 Aap, which came to power by showing big dreams, tied the hopes of the people
 ab ek saal puure hone par sarkaar kaa akalan kiya ja rahaa he
 The accounts of the work are being sought and the list of promises is being checked again
 is sabake bich dilli sarkaar media kii surkhiyon main khub chai rahi, ye kaam ko lekar kam balki vivaadon kii vajah se zyada tha
 These controversies kept the government alive on the news channels and on the front page of the newspaper throughout the year, whether there were discord in the organization, confrontation with the central government, sharp relations with the Lt
 Governor or thirty-six figures from the Delhi Police
 'aap' sarkaar ke ek saal puure hone par baat isi sarkaar se jude 10 vivaadon kii
 1-yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan were expelled from the party just a few days after becoming the government, internal issues started coming out within the party
 parinaam ye hua ki ek samay sanghathan kii shuruyaat karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko party se hi baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 Both accused the party of deviating from its policies
 2-mantri kii farji degree par bavaldilli sarkaar ke kanoon mantri jitendra tomars kii farji degree unhen jail kii salaakhon ke peeche tak le gai
 Even his law degree was not only fake, but the BSC degree also turned out to be fake
 3-'aap' kii ralimein kisaan kii aatmahatyakisaanon ko muaavja dene ke mudde par jantar-mantar par ho rahi raily main rajasthan ke kisaan gajendra ne aatmahatya kar lee
 At the time when Gajendra was dying, Arvind Kejriwal was giving a speech
 is par sarkaar kii jamkar aalochana hui or virodhiyon ne bhi khub kosa
 4- The minister was removed on charges of corruption, when Kejriwal made Asim a minister, he would not have even dreamed that one day he would become a big trouble for the party
 aasim par builder se rishwat maangane kaa aarope laga
 This time, the party removed Asim from his ministerial position before the matter came to light, revealing the mess

 " dilli ke anand parbat main guuruuvaar ko do ladakon ne puure mohalle ke saamne ladki ko dauda daudakar 35 baar chaakuon se goda
 She kept screaming with blows and kept begging for help
 lekin uski har cheekh ke saath mohalle ke khidki-daravaaje band hote rahe
 Finally the girl died there itself
 bhare mohalle main do ladakon ne kii hatya19 saal kii minakshighar kaa saamaan laane ke baahar nikali thi
 During this time, accused Jai Prakash, his brother Ilu and mother Shashi blocked his path
 shashi ne minakshi ke bal pakad liye
 He was attacked twice with a knife
 vah jaise- taise khud ko chhudaakar ghar ke paas cheekhti-pukaarti hui bhaagate hue ai
 Right in front of the house, Jai Prakash and Ilu catch him
 donon ne tabadatod waar kar hatya kar di
 Meenakshi's mother also attacked
 Despite Betty being surrounded by attackers, when the mother did not see anyone coming for help, she herself went ahead and tried to save her doll's life
 maa ne kaatilon ke haath bhi jode or fariyaad bhi kii
 But the scorching attackers in the fire of hate did not have any pity for Meenakshi nor did her mother feel any pity
 nateeja ye hua ki chand minuton main bhare mohalle ke bich donon maa-beti luhuluhaan pade the or hamalavar faraar ho chuke the
 The mother, who was later rushed to the hospital, was discharged after initial treatment
 lekin beti itane chaakuon ke waar nahin jhel saki
 Only his body came out of the hospital
 puraani ranjish main kii gai hatyadarasal, minakshi ke gharavaalon ne pados ke shohadon ke khilaaf teen saal pehle hi police se shikaayat kii thi

 15 oktober 2013 ko minakshi kii maa usha neanand parbat thane main shikaayatki thi jisamen unhone pados kii rahanevaali ek mahila shashi or uske do beton jai prakaash urf sanni or ilu ke khilaaf shikaayat kii thi
 According to this complaint, these two brothers were harassing Meenakshi for a long time, but not for a long time
 kabhi wo bich raste minakshi par fabtiyaan kasate, kabhi jaan se maar dene kii dhamkee dete to kabhi tejaab se cheharaa jala dene kii baat kehete
 But the police did nothing to these two brothers, although their mother Shashi must be sent to jail for a day
 iskaa nateeja ye hua ki us din se sanni or ilu donon hi minakshi or uske gharavaalon ko or pareshaan karne lage
 Fights started between the two families on the day they arrived
 padosiyon kii maane to donon bhai thik usee roj se apni maa ko jail bheje jane kaa badla lene kii baat kehete the
 Several teams of police together arrested the accused and formed several teams to arrest the murderers and also arrested Sunny and Eelu in a hurry
 vaise ab logon kaa kahana he ki agar police ne pehle hi donon bhaaiyon ke saath sakhti kii hoti, to shaayad aisi naubat nahin aati

 The villagers, awakened by the sound of gunfire, fled towards the jungles of the adjacent Manas National Park
 ve subah laute to nau shav mili, jinamein do mahilaon or do se saat saal umr ke chaar bacchon ke the
 So far, 41 bullet-riddled bodies have been recovered from the villages of Kokrajhar and Baksa districts in the bloodshed that began on May 1st
 eke-47 riflon se las ugravadiyon ne july 2012 ke baad sabase bhayaavah khun-kharabe ko anjaam diya he
 At that time, 92 people were killed and 4,00,000 were made homeless in Assam's Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD)
 beatiedi ke chaar jilon main do kokarajhaar or baksaa hai
 This bloodshed in May is the third major incident after the Tarun Gogoi government in Assam in 2001
 beatiedi main 2008 ke baad samudaayon ke jhgadon main 182 log maare gaye or 338 anya log bhi maare gaye jinamein saamaanya log, aatanki or surakshabalon ke log bhi shaamil the
 Gogoi, who became the chief minister for the third consecutive time, took the responsibility of not providing protection to the victims but refused to resign
 unhone bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi par dosha madh diya
 Modi had said at rallies in Assam that rhinoceros poaching is increasing in the state because the Congress government wants to settle illegal Bangladeshi residents around Kaziranga National Park
 5 may ko gogoi ne twit kiya ki 'modi ke betuke aarope’ beatiedi main khun-kharabe kii vajah bane
 He got support from Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah in this regard
 umr ne kaha ki assam main hinsa bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke yah kehane se bhadki ki ve 16 may ke baad sabhi bangladeshi musalamaanon ko bharat se khaded denge
 Opposition parties in Assam allege that Gogoi has kept a blind eye to these repeated massacres because the Bodoland People's Front (BPF), which is under his government, has a hand in these massacres
 assam main sabase badi vipakshi party ol india united democratic front (eiudief) ke netaa aminul islam kaa aarope he, ''yah bipief ke netaaon ke badale kii karrwai he jinka maananaa he ki musalamaanon ne kokerajhar loksabhaa kshetra se unke ummidavaar ko vot nahin diya
 "on April 30, a day before the massacre, bpf's Pramila Rani Brahm said on TV that her party's candidates could lose the election as 80 percent of Muslims voted for candidates from 13 non-bodo pressure groups
 islam kehete hai, ''chunaav ke pehle chandan brahm ne kaha tha ki agar log bipief ko vot nahin denge to haahaakaar much jayega
 Nevertheless, the Tarun Gogoi government of the state refused to take action
 ” vipaksh hi nahin, assam ke simavarti kshetra vikaas rajyamantri siddiq ahamed ne bhi hatyakand ke liye bipief ke ugravadi tatwon ko doshi bataaya
 The BPF is the new political avatar of the militant group Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT) and is denying involvement in violence
 alag bodo rajya ke liye hinsak sangram chalaane vaale blti ne 2003 main centre or rajya sarkaar se ek samjhaute par dastakhat kiye the
 This led to the formation of BTAD and the autonomous Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) and the administration of the area was entrusted to it
 blti ke sadasyon ne bipief naamak rajnatik party kaa gathan kiya or 13 may, 2005 ko pehali baar beatisi ke chunaav hue to vah satta main ai
 The BPF then joined the Congress government in the state from 2006
 chandan brahm assam sarkaar main parivahan mantri hai
 He says, "the allegations of violence are unfounded
 hamen apni jeet kaa puraa yakeen he
 "on the other hand, Gogoi says," If BPF is found involved in violence, then i will break all ties
 ”assam police taaja hinsa ke liye songabeijit gut ko doshi maanati he
 It is one of three factions of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB)

 Gogoi has handed over the investigation of the violence to the National Investigation Agency and has also set up a judicial inquiry
 ve chah din baad 7 may ko hinsagrast ilaakon kaa daura karne ke liye samay nikaal paae
 They did not budge even after the chief minister's visit of relatives of 18 victims of Baksa districts demanded burial of the body
 beatiedi ke ilaake main 1993 se jaateey jhgadon main kareeb 400 log maare gaye hai
 The Muslims became victims of violence this May, but they are not the only targets of Bodo militants
 1993 se kareeb 150 gaiyr-muslim bhi maare gaye hai
 These include Assamese and Santhalis
 11 janvari ko endiefabi (songabeijit) ke kaaryakartaaon ne kokerajhar main ek bas main yatra kar rahe paanch hindibhashi logon ko bhi maar diya tha
 Political commentator Atanu Bhuiyan says, "it is wrong to call them a riot
 yah endiefabi ke eke-47 se las ugravadiyon kaa hamalaa he
 “these seven incidents of violent violence in BTAD area are part of the violent fight between local Bodos and non-bodos
 is ilaake main bodo aabaadi 30 fisadi he
 There is a general perception throughout Assam, including the BTAD area, that illegal Bangladeshi immigrant locals are making minorities in their own area
 adivaasiyon kii jameen kii bikri gaiyr-adivaasiyon ko karne par pabandi lagane vaale kanoon kii lagaataar dhajjiyaan udayi jaati hai
 Political commentator Prashant Rajguru says that the non-bodo population in BTAD is being artificially increased as illegal immigrants have infiltrated many tribal blocks and forest lands and the state government has failed to protect the rights of tribals
 beatiedi or assam ke baaki hisson main khun-kharaba us aam dharna kii vajah se he ki bangladesh se lagaataar bade paimaane par logon ke aakar basane se yahaan musalmaan bahusankhya main aa jaaenge
 However, says Bhupen Sarma, director of the Society for Social Change and Development, Omev Kumar Das, "illegal infiltration is occurring but far less than the general perception
" ” 1991 or 2001 ke bich assam main jansankhya vruddhi 18

 The rate of 21 percent was recorded
 beatiedi ke ilaakon main tanaav 2005 main eiudief ke ubhaar ke saath badha
 The opposition party is demanding dissolution of BTC as it is alleged that many non-bodo populated villages have been included in it
 2006 main jab tarun gogoi ko sarkaar banane ke liye bipief or eiudief main se kisi ek ko chunanaa tha to unhone bodo party ko satta main apana bhagidaar banaaya
 Five years later, when Gogoi returned to power with 78 seats in the 126-member assembly, he did not need bpf's support
 unhone use sirf ek mantri pad dene kii peshkash kii
 But to keep the demands of the state of Bodoland, the strategy of sharing power in power is currently inverted
 baaten chaahe jo bhi kii jaaen lekin is sachaai se munh nahin modaa ja saktaa ki swytt jilon ke logon ko yah pataa hi nahin he ki kab goliyaan chalane lag jaaengi or is tarah kii ghatnaayen dehshat paidaa karne ke liye kaaphi hai

 vedant kii is karmbhumi main trisha bhaashan likhane se lekar reliyon tak main uskaa saath detii he

 :) In the Bharat Nagar area of the capital Delhi, a girl entered the house and was shot
 anshul naam kii ladki peshey se charted accountint he
 He is currently admitted to the hospital where he is undergoing treatment
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki aaropee ladki ko pehle se jaanata tha
 The police have arrested the accused boy
 25 saal kii anshul shalimaar baag ke ek aspataal main bhartee he
 According to information from sources, both were in the first relationship
 ladki kii kahin or sagaai hone ke baad donon kaa brallep ho gaya tha
 The name of the accused is Harish aka Pintu
 harish anshul ke saath paanch saal se relationships main tha
 a few days ago Anshul got engaged to someone else
 ye baat anshul ko bardaasht nahin hui, jiske baad se vah lagaataar anshul ko dhamkiyaan de rahaa tha
 On Saturday night, Harish went to Anshul's house and attacked him
 philhal anshul khatre ke baahar he
 a 20-year-old girl was killed by a boy on Saturday in Thane, Maharashtra
 aaropee akaash pavaar ko police ne giraftaar kar liya
 The accused had been following the girl for the past few months
 isaki shikaayat ladki ke parivaar waalon ne police main bhi kii thi, lekin koi karrwai nahin kii gai thi
 The accused boy attacked the girl while she was going somewhere with Scooty
 ladki kii pahchaan praachi jaade ke taur par hui he
 Event 11 of Saturday day
 30 baje kii he
 The girl lay in an injured condition on the road, after which she was brought to a private hospital, but she died
 police ne kaha he ki ladki kopri kii rahane vaali thi or thane main padhai kar rahi thi
 The girl's throat and stomach were stabbed
 chhedchhad ke khilaaf andolan kar raheen kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay (biechayu) kii chaatraon par hue lathicharge ko lekar ab ek nayaa angel saamne aayaa he
 District Magistrate of Varanasi Yogeshwar Ram Mishra has said that due to the uniform of BHU guards being similar to the UP Police personnel, the situation of Confusion was created
 mishra ne agle do din main biechayu ke surakshakarmiyon kii vardi badalane kaa aadesh diya he
 After this claim of the District Magistrate, the issue of lathicharge and girlhood has started appearing on the students
 jiladhikari ke is bayaan ke myne saaf hai ki wo police dwaara lathicharge kii baat ko halkaa karnaa chaahate hai or sara thikra biechayu ke khaaki vardidhari gards par phodna chaahate hai
 Now questions are arising that who lathi-charged the students of BHU? Did bhu's 'uniformed goons' lathi on innocent girl students? If yes, who ordered lathicharge on the girl students? The question is that if the BHU guards nixed the sticks on the girl students, what action did the administration take against them and those who ordered the lathicharge
 sawaal ye bhi ki kahin jiladhikari, prashasan or sarkaar kii khaal bachaane ke liye to biechayu ke gardon ko bali kaa bakra nahin bana rahe kyonki is maamle main vipaksh yogi sarkaar ko gher rahaa he
 To control the student movement, police of 25 police stations should be informed that in view of the fear of violence and tension in BHU campus on Saturday, the administration had called police of 25 police stations
 ahimsak andolan kar rahi chaatraon par ek baar lathicharge kii karrwai shuru hui, to police ke jawan chatravaason main ghus gaye or students kii pitayee kii
 Now the question is whether the policemen or BHU guards were really the men who beat and beat hostels
 college main ghuskar hui marpethpradhanmantri narendra modi ke varanasi daure ke samay hi chaatr andolan jor pakadaney laga tha
 The plan of the agitating students was that if the Vice Chancellor did not come to meet them, the Prime Minister's convoy would be stopped
 is baat kii bhanak security ko lag gai or piem kaa root badal diya gaya
 After this, the students turned to the Vice Chancellor's residence
 uniwarsity ke security guard ne unako jamkar maaraa
 The woman entered the college and was beaten up
 puraa bavaal raat 3 baje tak chalata rahaa
 The Cantonment was made to control the BHU students and the University and District Administration had converted the BHU into the camp campus
 25 thanon kii police ne pradarshnakariyon ko niyantran main laane ke liye lathicharge ke saath hi 16 round firing kar di
 Tear gas shells were fired along with aerial firing
 is bavaal main chaatr-chaatraon ke saath kai patrakaron or pulicekarmiyon ko chot ai

 yah sawaal paidaa ho gaya ki kya rani mukherjee ko du:kha kii is ghadi main unki kagin sistar kaajol unhen sahaara dengi? darasal, donon ke rishte achche nahin maane jate hai
 Do know why there was always sourness in their relationship
 rani mukherjee ke pita ke antim sanskaar main pahunchin ye celebritikajol ke pita shomu mukherjee or rani ke pita ram mukherjee first kagin the
 In this way, Kajol and Rani also became cousins

 From time to time, some such incidents have happened that their efforts to improve their relationship - the right efforts have also become useless
 donon ke rishte us samay or bighad gaye jab 2012 main rani mukherjee ke pati aditya chopra kii film jab tak he jaan or ajay devgan kii film san of sardaar kii relies ko lekar klesh ho gaya
 During this, Shah Rukh and Kajol's relationship also deteriorated

 ye mauka hota he durga puja kaa
 a picture of both of them went viral, in which Kajol is serving Gulab Jamun to Rani Mukerji
 bataa den ki kaajol or rani karan johar kii film kuch-kuch hota he main ek saath kaam bhi kar chuki hai
 Now it will be a matter to see whether this opposite clock which comes in front of the queen proves to be helpful in improving the relationship of both or not
 philhal, kaajol chhuttiyaan manaane goa gai hai
 Whether or not she returned to Mumbai could not be known
 bollywood actor salmaan khan apni apakaming film 'tubalite' ko pramot karne kaa koi mauka nahin ganvaa rahe hai
 From Bollywood to Hollywood, Salman's film 'tubelight' has been discussed
 yahaan tak ki salmaan kii film 'tubalite' neuyork pahunch gai he, jahaan film ke nirmaataaon ne neuyork ke times squaire main 'tubalite' ke bade hording lagaae hai
 Filmmakers are trying their best to keep Salman's Indian fans as well as international fans happy
 pakistan main nahin jalegi salmaan khan kii 'tubalite'isi ke saath, salmaan bollywood ke un celebs kii list main shaamil ho gaye hai jinaki film ke posters ko times squaire par pradarshit karne kaa mauka mila
 The film has just a few days left to release

 Although Salman Khan Films' COO, Amar Bhutla has confirmed that the film 'tubelight' will definitely be released in Pakistan, but its release date is not fixed yet
 'tubalite' kii relies se pehle 'bahubali 2' ke saamne salmaan ne teke ghutnefilm main lambey samay baad phens bollywood kii karan-arjuna jodi yani salmaan or shahrukh khan ko ek saath screen share karte dikhenge
 Talking about Shahrukh's role in the film, Salman bollywoodlife
 com ko bataaya, 'main bahut khush hum ki shahrukh ne meri film main kaam kiya
 His entry in the film will bring an interesting twist to the film's story
 ''ek tha tiger' or 'bajrangi bhaijan' ke baad nirdeshak kabir khan ke saath salmaan kii yah teesri film he

 bahut adhik dhul-dhuen, pradooshan or surya kii khatarnaak kirnon ke sampark main aane se skin cancer hone kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 Sometimes too much makeup also serves to invite this dangerous disease
 in karkon ke bare main sambhavat: aapako pehle se pataa ho lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki aapke sharir par maujuud chote-chote til bhi khatre kaa sanket ho sakate hai? kai baar sharir par ubhar aane vaale til cancer kaa sanket hote hai
 Actually mole is a group of more than one cell that can grow continuously
 umr ke anusaar inke rang, aakaar or prakaar main bhi parivartan aata rahata he
 Although this is very common
 visheshgyon kii maane to kareeb 99 fisadi til bina kisi nuksaan ke hote hanore umr badhane ke saath hi gaayab bhi hote jate hai
 But even a one percent threat cannot be sidelined
 aise main agar aapke til main koi bhi badlaav najar aae to use andekha na karen
 It may be a sign of some serious illness
 agar ye badlaav bahut hi bhayaavah ho to turant doctor ke paas jaaen
 If your mole changes its shape overnight, you get itchy at that place and start bleeding from there, then it is time to go to the doctor
 aapke til kuch is tarah dete hai khatre kaa sanket:1
 Irregularity: If your mole is divided into two equal parts and you feel that both parts are very different from each other, then it is a matter of concern
 2
 Are not the edges of your mole the same? Is their color lighter or thicker than the color of sesame? If yes, contact a skin specialist immediately
 3
 Colors are the most important sign
 agar aapako til kaa rang kuch ajeeb lage, ye halkaa bhi ho saktaa haior gadha bhi, to aise main turant doctor ko sampark karen
 4
 dardakya jab aap apane til ko choote hai to aapako dard mahasoos hota he yaa koi jhanjhanaahat hoti he? agar haa to ye aapke liye satark ho jane kaa samay he
 5
 anuvaanshisgar aapke sharir par bahut adhik til hon or aapke ghar main pehle kisi ko skin cancer kii samasya rah chuki ho to behatar hoga ki aap ekbar doctor se jarur mil len

 Much has been written about the 1983 World Cup over the years
 kuch kahaniyaan bhula di gai hai, kuch kaa batangad bana diya gaya he to kuch managasaint bana di gai hai
 All of this is done to explain how a raw, mismatched team from India became world champions
 jo us samay hua, use main bhi kaaphi kuch bhul chukaa hum
 But that feeling, that atmosphere and that sensation will always be with me
 tab main mahaj 24 saal kaa tha
 i was not very fond of Indian cricket in that era
 tab tak cricket badi angrejiyat vaala tha or usamen 'samskruti' or parvarish ko kaaphi tavajjo di jaati thi
 My background would be said to be better than that
 mere liye angreji bolnaa swaabhaavik nahin tha or main kaashtakaari kii parampara se aayaa tha, jiske chalate main jameen se judaa, bebaak, kabhi-kabhi beadab or paaramparik arth main 'susanskrit' nahin tha
 At that time it was a myth of Indian society that to be successful you must be very educated and speak fluent English
 ab yah myth tut chukaa he or hamaare paas har prishthbhumi se aakar rashtriya pahchaan banane vaale khilaadi, profeshnal or netaa tak hai
 It was then a unique decision to make a player like me captain of the Indian team
 kai saare log yah dekhnaa chaahate the ki kai varisht or susanskrit khiladiyon vaali team main bataur captain main kya kar paata hum
 Now 32 years later, remembering that era, it seems that my unusual background proved beneficial for the team somewhere
 main kabhi kisi khilaadi se chamatkrit nahin rahaa, bhale hi uske liye mere man main kitna bhi sammaan kyon na ho
 This also allowed me to challenge the notion that some teams are traditionally superior and that is why we were able to compete against the best teams
 lihaaja, bhartiya team toornament main apni jagah banane ko utari thi
 After playing a few opening matches — including a win at Leicester against Zimbabwe and a defeat at Trentbridge against Australia and at the Oval against the West Indies — it became clear that our team might not have been superstars but had many different - Different players had the ability to take command
 tab tak ham vishwa cap main apane abhiyaan ke najuk daur main pahunch chuke the
 Our next match at Tunbridge Wells was against Zimbabwe
 mujhe yaad he ki hamane ghante bhar tak team kii meeting kii
 Our stats tell us that we can reach the semi-finals despite losing our last group match against Australia
 lekin uske liye hamen zimbabwe ke khilaaf pehle khelte hue 311 ran banaakar match jeetna hoga
 We were not used to winning against big teams, so instead of hanging in the balance with Australia, we focused on this goal
 lekin jald hi vah ek dur kii kaudi najar aane laga
 We had lost 3 wickets for 6 runs, 4 wickets for 9 runs and when i got down to bat, i had lost 5 wickets for 17 runs
 jis team ko khel ke is chote aakaar main pari khadi karne kaa koi gumaan nahin tha, uske liye to yah sthiti band raste par pahunchane jaisi thi
 What happened in the match after that is certainly a history
 main roger binni kii madad se apane ardhashatak par pahunchaa, madan ke sahyog se shatak par or phir saiyad kirmani ke saath maine naabad 175 ran kii pari kheli
 We scored 266 runs in 60 overs and won the match easily
 vah vishwa cap main hamaare liye nirnaayak mode tha
 Suddenly we started feeling that we can achieve anything
 haal hi main ek tivi sho ke dauraan mujhe us baat kaa ehsaas hua, jo ab tak itane saalon main mere dhyaan se chook gai thi—meri vah pari van-de cricket main kisi bhartiya kii pehali shatkeey pari thi
 i am referring to this only to bring attention to how much our team was a novice in one-day cricket while landing in the 1983 tournament
 hamaare isi angarhpan se samoochaa england yakeen karne laga tha ki old traverd main semifinal ekatarfa rahane vaala he
 The newspaper headlines were predicting a West Indies vs England final match
 yahi ati aatmavishvaas unki sabase badi galati thi
 i remember that match for some great performances
 ham final main bina ummiido ke utarane se khush hi the
 In team meetings we decided whether to win or lose, to play like champions
 lekin jab hamane lords main pich dekhi to hamaare puraane dar lautne lage
 The wicket was so green that it was difficult to separate it from the rest of the field and on that pitch we had to face Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Malcolm Marshall and Joel Garner
 lekin krishnamachari shrikant ne acchhee shuruyaat kii
 He lightened the initial pressure by withstanding the famous fast quartet
 unke 38 ran aage jaakar puure match main donon tiimon kii taraf se adhiktam vyaktigat score sabit hue
 Much has been said about our 'modest' score of 183 but i am happy that in those situations we had seam bowlers instead of fast paced bowlers
 balvinder sandhu ne hamen shandaar shuruyaat di or madan, binni or amarnath sab saath lag liye
 i ran back and caught the catch of Vivian Richards, then Sunny Gavaskar took four catches
 us dopaher lords ke maidan par anhoni hui
 We created history and changed the picture of Indian cricket forever
 kai saare visheshgyon ne baad main kaha ki vah jeet tukka thi
 His point would have been proved right if we had not won the World Series in Australia after two years
 uske baad koi yah nahin kah saktaa tha ki ham champion van-de team nahin the or 1983 kii hamaari jeet kismat se mili thi, agar ab bhi koi aisa kahata he to cricket ke bare main uske gyaan par jaraa sawaal uthaane kii jarurat he

 According to informed sources, this has been done informally by the Congress party in view of the party's rally in Patna on February 3
 congress kaa aagrah he ki vartmaan main saare netaa is raily ke aayojan main vyast hai isliye teen farvari ke baad hi siton kii sankhya or naam ke bare main ghoshnaa kii jaae
 Sources in the RJD say that it is imperative to postpone the decision to seat seats in view of the system of party's big leaders
 haalanki in sutron kaa kahana he ki rajd or congress main siton kii sankhya ko lekar koi aisi bhi baat nahin he jiske kaaran baatcheet khatai main pad jaae
 Although the Congress is expected to get more seats, it is also aware of the fact that at present, due to half a dozen constituents, it is out of power to give the number of seats according to the wishes of each component
 yahi kaaran he ki congress siton kii sankhya se zyada is baat par kendrit he ki aisi siten lee jaaen jahaan jeetne kii sambhaavna adhik ho
 Meanwhile, in the next few days, the Congress will duly invite RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav to participate in the Congress rally
 is raily main mukhya vaktaa ke rup main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi maujuud rahenge
 After nearly two decades in Patna, the rally is being organized by the Congress at Gandhi Maidan

 ’ maharatna kii paatr company ne navratna kaa bhi darja khokar puunji bazaar main utarane se kadam waapas khinch liye
 The government hastily recalled both of its nominated directors from the ONGC board of directors in a hurry to bring the FPO
 iskaa khamiyaja company ko bhugatna padaa or use apane navratna ke darje se hi haath dhonaa pad gaya
 The company with the status of Navratna has the autonomy to invest Rs 1,000 crore in joint ventures and approve large projects
 navratna niyamon ke anusaar company apane is adhikaar kaa istemaal tabhi kar sakati he jab uske nideshak mandal main sarkaar dwaara namit nideshak shaamil honge
 The official said, "the consequences of recalling government directors from ONGC Board of Directors will be serious, so it has now been decided that regular appointments of independent directors be made and till then the FPO has been deferred

 reddy ne do swatantra nideshkon ke naam kebinet ke paas manjuuri ke liye bheje
 Reddy argued that the post of CMD in ONGC is vacant
 maanav sansaadhan nideshak ke sthanantaran ke baad unke sthaan par bhi koi niyukti nahin hui
 Director Exploration has also retired, so the number of boards of directors has come down from nine to six
 udhar, swatantra nideshkon kii sankhya chaar he isaliye keval do kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Earlier, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet approved the names of two independent directors in ONGC
 ve

 ab teen swatantra nideshkon kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 The two directors, whose names were sent without investigation and without considering the rules, also found that one cannot be appointed
 saarvajanik upkram main anya companiyon main karyrat kaaryakari adhikari ko swatantra nideshak nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 Only one independent director was appointed
 epapo jald bazaar main laane kii sharton ko puraa karne ke liye mantralay ne apane dono sarkari nideshkon ko hi waapas bulaanaa behatar samajha
 So that the number of five becomes equal

 chaahe hindu ho yaa koi or majahab ke hon
 He was an enemy of their Sultanate
 ovaisi ne imran khan ko ye naseehat dete hue kaha ki unako tipu sultan or bahadoor shah jafar ke bare main padhanaa chahie
 But they sit in the assembly and talk strange things
 vahiin, hyderabad main ek sabha ko sambodhit karte hue ovaisi ne bhaajapa par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 He said that if i am a Muslim you will doubt whether it is loyal or anti national, but listen to my one thing if BJP is saying that my booth is the strongest then i will say, my border is strong and my country is strong
 isse pehle bhi pulavama aatanki hamale kii ninda karte hue ovaisi ne kaha tha ki is hamale ke peeche pakistan kaa haath he

 He further added that 'mohammad's soldier does not kill any person, he is kind to humanity
 tum jaish-e-shaitan, jaish-e-iblis hai
 Exist Azhar, you are not a maulana, you are a disciple of the devil

 Because of this, the explosion became so deadly and 40 of our soldiers were martyred
 # watchasaduddin Owaisi, AIMIM: Pak PM talked of Tipu Sultan & Bahadur Shah Zafar in his assembly,tipu Sultan wasn't enemy of Hindus but adversary of the enemies of his sultanate
 He talks about atom bomb, it's weird

 India will return to the London Olympics with their best ever in terms of medals, with Sports Minister Ajay Maken expressing satisfaction over the athletes' performance and hoping that the country can win 25 medals at the 2020 Olympic Games
 bharat ne beijing olympic main teen padak jite the, jisamen ek swarna bhi shaamil tha
 India has won five medals in London so far, which is their best ever in terms of medals
 iske liye maakan ne athleton ke pradarshan kii tarif kii
 Maken said in a TV show, if you compare India's past performance, i think it is India's best performance in Olympics so far
 hamane padakon kii sankhya ke hisaab se sudhaar kiya he
 He said, you can compare, how many medals India could have won since hockey started, except hockey
 isamen keval saat padak the, lekin is baar hamen ab tak chaar padak mil gaye hai (saakshaatkaar ke samay chaar padak mili the)
 "we can win 25 medals by 2020, which is an achievable goal," Maken said
 inamen se paanch yaa 10 swarna ho sakate hai
 We cannot tell the exact number of gold medals
 maakan ko lagata he ki jab tak desh kaa maanav vikaas suchak lachar or prati vyakti aay kam rahegi, tab bharat or adhik padak jeetne kii ummid nahin kar saktaa
 He said, as far as human development indicator is concerned, India is ranked 134 in the world, while India is at 129th in per capita income
 lekin ab tak (saakshaatkaar ke samay) ham olympic main 46wein sthaan par hai
 The game is not about the number of people
 tippaniyan Maken said, this is a big achievement for the players and the country
 keval do hi desh aise hai, jinka maanav vikaas suchak kam he, lekin ve olympic main bharat se upar hai
 But the human development indicators and per capita income of all the countries which occupy the top of the medal table are quite high
 ye sari chijen ek duusare se judi hai
 Although India has not won enough medals, the Sports Minister feels that the performance of the players was commendable
 unhone kaha, ek baat bataaun, hamane kaaphi sudhaar kiya he
 This time 81 of our players took part in the Olympics, which was only 56 last time
 kya yah bada sudhaar nahin he? athleton kii sankhya kareeb 25 pratishat badi he or kul padakon kii sankhya main bhi 25 pratishat hi badhotaree hui he
 The gold medal is yet to come
 ham pichley padakon kii sankhya doguni bhi kar sakate hai
 "having 56 to 81 players is no less an improvement," Maken said

 It had only seven medals, but this time we have got four medals so far (four medals were received at the time of interview)
 maakan ne kaha, 2020 tak ham 25 padak jeet sakate hai, yah hasil karne yogya lakshya he
 Five or 10 of these can be gold
 ham swarna padakon kii sankhya bilkul sateek nahin bataa sakate
 Maken feels that as long as the country's human development indicator is low and per capita income is low, India cannot hope to win more medals
 unhone kaha, jahaan tak maanav vikaas suchak kaa sawaal he, bharat duniya main 134wein sthaan par he, jabaki prati vyakti aay main bharat 129wein number par he
 But so far (at the time of the interview) we are ranked 46th in the Olympics
 khel logon kii sankhya ke bare main nahin he
 The comments maakan ne kaha, yah khilaadiyon or desh ke liye badi uplabdhi he
 There are only two countries which have low human development indicators, but they are above India in the Olympics
 lekin padak talika main sheersh par kabiz sabhi deshon kaa maanav vikaas suchak or prati vyakti aay kaaphi adhik he
 All these things are related to each other
 haalanki bharat ne kaaphi padak nahin jite hai, lekin khelmantri ko lagata he ki khilaadiyon kaa pradarshan saraahneey tha
 He said, tell me one thing, we have improved a lot
 is baar hamaare 81 khilaadiyon ne olympic main hissaa liya, jinaki sankhya pichhali baar keval 56 thi
 Isn't this a big improvement? The number of athletes has increased by almost 25 percent and the total number of medals has also increased by 25 percent
 swarna padak abhi tak nahin aayaa he
 We can also double the number of previous medals
 maakan ne kaha, 56 se 81 khilaadi hona kam sudhaar nahin he

 (idea, which illuminates life
 ) Today, Friendship Day is being celebrated all over the world
 dosti ko yun bhi kisi bhi insaan ke jivan ke sabase mahatvapurn rishton main shumaar kiya jaataa he
 It is said that you cannot choose your parents, but you can definitely choose your friends
 isi se andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki dosti kaa kisi bhi insaan ke jivan main kitna mahatv he
 However, sometimes these friendships become more intimate and in such a situation it becomes difficult for parents to know whether their child is a friend of other children or whether they are gay
 jab tak aapkaa baccha khud se aakar naa kahe ki wo ge yaa lesbian he tab tak aap puri tarah se shyor nahin ho sakate hai
 That is why you need to win their trust
 agar aapako lagata he ki aapkaa baccha samalangik he to us par kisi tarah kaa dabaav naa banaaen
 You may be curious to know about them, but putting more pressure on children can have adverse consequences and they may never talk to you about it again
 udhaaharan ke taur par, tivi par agar koi song yaa sho samalangik logon se judaa hua aa rahaa he to aap us samay samalangikta ko lekar bacchon ke saamne apane positive vichaar rakh sakate hai yaa phir aise samalangik celebs ke bare main baat kar sakate hai jo kaaphi femes hai
 Also try to keep a very general attitude about homosexuality
 isse bacchon main ye yakeen paidaa hoga ki aap ge or lesbian rishton ko lekar secentive hai or ve aapse apni baat share karne main comfortebel ho sakate hai
 Although children's behavior cannot be stereotyped, but there are some things that can give you some idea that your child is gay
 masalan, agar aapke bete ko outdoor sports masalan cricket, hockey main khaas ruchi naa ho, use ladakiyon ke saath khelnaa pasand ho, apni maa ke mechap kit yaa gudiya vaale khel main dilchaspee rakhata ho to sambhaavna he
 Similarly, if your child is interested in outdoor games and is interested in cross dress behavior then she is also likely to be gay
 haalanki ye bhi sach he ki ye sirf sambhaavna he or ho saktaa he ki aisa sach naa ho
 It would be better if you make your children comfortable in every situation so that they can say their heart to you
 sachai yahi he ki agar aap is baat se khush nahin he ki aapkaa betaa yaa beti samalangik hai to bhi aapako is sachai ko apnaanaa hoga
 It would be better if you show maturity other than your feelings and if you want happiness of your children, then support them in their decisions
 ho saktaa he ki samaaj ke chaar log or aapke rishtedaar is baat ko sahaj dhang se naa le paaen lekin ye aapaki jimmedaari he ki aap apane bacchon ko comfortable feel karaaen or unki feelings ko sunen
 One thing you can do is to provide correct information to your gay or lesbian child
 ab bhi samaaj samalangik logon ko lekar bahut sahaj nahin he or agar bacchon ko sambhala naa gaya to chizein asahaj karne vaali bhi ho sakati he
 In such a situation, it is important that you be sensitive about your child and provide them the right information in the Internet era
 samalangik logon kii sabase badi samasya tab aati he jab samalangik hone ke chalate unhen apane doston yaa pariwaron ko khone kaa dar rahata he
 Though there has been a change in the law and society's view of homosexuality in the country, but it still seems inadequate at times
 aise main aapako apane bachche kaa saport system banane kii jarurat he
 Also inform them about the minorities of LGBT community who are role models for their society so that these children can be inspired

 The body of the tiger was found flowing near the Sharda Canal in the jungles of Barahi Range on the morning of Thursday 23 April
 yah nahar pilibhit tiger rigerv ke dakshini-purvi chor ke paas se bahati he
 Although the forest department claimed that the tiger died due to water in the lungs, the way his corpse was found stuck in the canal on the road leading to 'sharda canal bifurcation' from Madhavandanda town of Pilibhit is another story
 Was making a statement
 uski gardan par ghaav ke nishaan the
 The cushion of the rear claw was hurt and there were several marks of bruising on the body
 ye saare nishaan shikariyon ke changul se batch nikalne kii kahani bayaan kar rahe the
 Otherwise, except human beings, what other animal in the forest that would challenge the tiger in such a way of life
 vah nirih pashu to haar gaya, lekin uski maut shivalik kii tarai main khadey pilibhit ke jangalon main shikariyon-taskaron ke gathjod ke bich apane astitv kii jang lard rahe baaghon kii kahani bataati he
 While the number of tigers has increased by almost 30% in the entire country during the last four years, Pilibhit is the only forest area in Uttar Pradesh, where their number has decreased in the same way
 2010 kii gananaa ke anusaar, pilibhit vanya kshetra main baaghon kii sankhya 36 se 38 thi, lekin chaar saal baad ye ghatakar sirf 28 rah gaye hai
 It is the result of weak government surveillance that eight tigers have died in Pilibhit during the last three years
 yahi vajah he ki tamaam koshishon ke baavjood uttar pradesh main baaghon kii sankhya 2010 se 2014 ke bich 118 se ghatakar 117 rah gai he
 However, in 2006, in the state of 109 tigers, their number increased to 118 within four years
 lekin ab is giravat se pradesh main baagh sangrakshan kii koshishon ko dhakka pahunchaa he
 In UP, their numbers have increased in Dudhwa National Park, Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Kishanpur Sanctuary, Bijnore Wildlife Area, Northern and Southern Kheri Wildlife area, but the decrease in tiger population in the forests of Pilibhit has overshadowed the increased Sanctha in other areas is

 stf's Additional Superintendent of Police Arvind Chaturvedi, who has been monitoring the poachers in Pilibhit for the last three years, asks, "why are tigers found dead in these forests on the banks of a drain or canal?" Why don't they meet in the field? ”in collusion with forest workers, half a dozen skins of tigers were recovered from a gang of smugglers in the forests of Bijnor in 2011 and 2013
 pakade gaye logon se dudhwa neshnal park ke bheetar shikariyon kaa giroh sakriy hone kii soochna mili thi, lekin is park ke andar yaa isse sambandhit koi bhi kadi estf ke haath nahin lagi
 Chaturvedi says, "it was during the plight of Dudhwa National Park that the STF received intelligence about tiger hunting in Pilibhit
 "tafteesh chal hi rahi thi ki isi saal farvari main nepal police ne apni jaankaree ke aadhaar par alag-alag maamalon main do bharatiyon ko pakadaa, jinase baagh kii khaal baraamad hui thi
 The arrested accused revealed the names of Pilibhit's people to the Nepal police, who had given them tiger skin to sell

 Several people including Fariyad and his brother Mushtaq of Hazara police station area were caught in a joint operation of the STF and Forest Department together

 The STF had put the mobile numbers of these smugglers on surveillance, which showed that they are constantly talking to some forest workers

 Khan says, "without the connivance of forest workers, there cannot be hunting in this reserve
" lekin vibhaag abhi tak aise karmchaariyon par koi prabhavi ankush nahin laga paaya he
 "the peak surveillance mechanism is the responsibility of the chukka-one and chukka-two beats under the Mahof range of 48-year-old Rameshchandra Bhatt, posted as the Forest Guard in the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve
 haalanki inke sahyog ke liye chaar vaachak karmchaariyon ko lagaaya gaya he
 Despite this, monitoring the tiger in the forest spread over a total of 3,300 hectares is out of Bhatt's potential
 yah takalif un sabhi 30 gardon kii he, jo ek saath do-do beet kaa jimmaa sambhaal rahe hai
 There are 60 posts of forest guard in Pilibhit Tiger Reserve, but only 30 deployed
 yahi kaaran he ki ek forest guard par do se teen biton kii jimmedaari he
 Similarly, in the total 23 sections of the Tiger Reserve, there are 50 Forester posts for the support of Range Officers, but 22 of them are also working

 "tiger rigerv main nigaraanee tantra kis kadar charmaraya hua he, isaki baangi yah he ki yahaan par kul 15 driveron ke pad par mahaj ek kii hi tainaati he
 Authorities are illegally running their vehicles with "tractor cleaners"
 isi vajah se pilibhit tiger rigerv main shikari or taskaron main pakade jane kaa khauf nahin he
 Kailash Prakash, the officer-in-charge of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve, refutes these allegations, saying, "forest personnel have been equipped with sophisticated equipment to deal with poachers
" mukhabiron ke jariye inaki kadi nigaraanee kii ja rahi he
 "as soon as we reach outside the office of the officer in charge of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve, the slogans printed in red-green on the white boundary wall will draw your attention
 sabase bada he dharm apana, vanyajeevon kii raksha karnaa, aao sundar desh banaaen, vanya jeevon ko ham bachaaen
 But perhaps the Forest Department has not learned any lesson from these slogans

 Has the demonetization really proved to be a dug up hill? The Reserve Bank data on Wednesday has proved to be a near flop show of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's favorite note-ban experiment
 500 rupee or 1000 rupee ke puraane noton ko band karne kii jo pasinaa chhudaa dene vaali kasarat hui, us kasarat kii keemat sirf 16 hajaar karod rupee hi nikali he
 The Reserve Bank, which took 8 months to count the closed notes deposited, when finaly counted the notes, it was found that most of the notes were deposited back
 aise main sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye hai ki kya notebandi ke jariye kaledhan ko safed kiya gaya?reserve bank of india kii salanaa report main die aankadon ke mutabik:-notebandi se pehle 1000 rupee ke 633 karod note the, jisamen se notebandi ke baad 98
 6 percent notes were deposited - only 8 crore 90 lakh notes of 1000 rupees were not deposited, that is, 8900 crore rupees were not returned - RBI has not given any data on the old 500 rupee note and has said that verification is going on right now
 It has been - according to the total data, only 16 thousand crore rupees were not deposited in the notes of 15 lakh crore rupees, the Reserve Bank also said that on every 10 lakh notes of 500 rupees, the average 7 notes were copied
 There were - on an average 19 notes out of every 10 lakh notes closed for 1000 rupees were fake
 
 
 vipaksh ne shuru kiya ataikain aankadon ke baad sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai ki jab kareeb-kareeb 99 fisadi band note waapas aa gaye to phir notebandi kii itani badi kasarat kaa matlab kya niklaa
 The figure of fake notes also turned out to be much lower than expected
 yahi vajah he ki ab vipaksh sarkaar par phul atake kar rahaa he
 Former Finance Minister p Chidambaraman said that the demonetisation gave the Reserve Bank 16,000 crore rupees, but it took 21 thousand crore rupees to print new notes
 sarkaar ke arthshaastriyon ko to nobel aword milanaa chahie
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi tweeted that many people died due to demonetisation and also suffered economic loss
 aise main kya pradhanmantri ab isaki jimmedaari lenge
 a colossal failure which cost innocent lives and ruined the economy

 6% note laut aae, to notebandi se hua kya?98 fisadi se zyaada band note waapas jamaa ho jane ke aankade par sarkaar kii jabardast aalochana ho rahi he
 It is being said that demonetization did not make much sense
 haalanki in aankadon ke baavjood sarkaar ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin he ki wo notebandi ke tay target main fail hui he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was immediately exposed to the media due to the criticisms that have come after the Reserve Bank's annual report and the demonetisation figures
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki notebandi ke fail ho jane kii baat karne vaale or uski aalochana karne vaale kanfus hai
 Such people do not understand the whole purpose of demonetisation
 iskar vibhaag jaanch kar rahaa hajetali kaa kahana tha notebandi ke baad uske sambandh main kuch log tippanee kar rahe hai ki notebandi kaa ek maatr uddeshy ye tha ki log paisa jamaa naa karaaen or paisa jabt ho jayega
 Those who have never fought a war against black money in life, may not understand the purpose of this whole process
 ye kisi kaa paisa jabt karne kaa uddeshy nahin tha
 If money comes in the banking system, it does not mean that all that money is legitimate
 is paise ke khilaaf iskar vibhaag puri jaanch karata he
 This is the reason millions of people have been put on notice
 jiskaa ek pratyaksh asar hua he ki diarect tex base badha he
 It has also increased the impact of GST
 'har jamaa rakam vaid nahin hoti'arun jetali bataaya ki notebandi kaa uddeshy tha ki tex base bade
 It was also intended that action should be taken against the people who deposited black money
 saath hi vyavastha se jaali note alag kar paaen
 Also, the aim was to create a lace cash system
 saath hi notebandi se algaavvaadiyon ko bhi aarthik chot pahunchi he
 The terrorists have seized the money
 aise main paisa vyavastha main aa jaae to wo vaid paisa nahin ho jaataa he
 Arun Jaitley said that all the objectives of the government are on track
 pashchim bengal main ek taraf bijepi apana vajood badhaane main juty he, to vahiin congress apni ek khaas samasya se lagaataar pareshaan he
 Actually, the big problem facing Rahul Gandhi is whether the alliance for 2019 is from Left or Trinamool
 pradesh congress adhyaksh or saansad adheer ranjan choudhary left ke saath talmail ke pakshdhar hai, to vahiin party ke zyaadaatar vidhayak or saansad mamata ke saath gathjod chaahate hai
 Meanwhile, Congress leaders did not stop joining Trinamool Congress
 21 july ko kolkata main hone vaali raily main bhi kai congressi trinmul kaa haath thaamne vaale hai
 Earlier, many mlas and an MP have openly given an ultimatum to Rahul, that there should be an alliance with Mamta or else he will join Trinamool
 ab 21 july najadik aa rahi he, isi se pareshaan bengal congress ke saansad or purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke suputr abhijit mukherjee ne sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii
 According to sources, in this meeting held in the Congress office in the Parliament House complex, Abhijeet had come up with a special proposal, in which his concern was clearly visible
 abhijit ne sonia se kaha ki, sabase pehle mamata banerjee ke saath ek samjhauta ho, jiske tahat wo congress party main tod-phod naa karen
 Abhijeet directly told Sonia - No Poaching Agreement with Trinamool
 lekin sonia ne abhijit kii baat sunate hi tapaak se jawaab diya, 'maine to suna he ki, jo netaa trinmul main ja rahe hai wo apni marji se ja rahe hai
 After this, Mukherjee quietly left Sonia
 bataa den ki left ke saath talmail karke vidhansabha chunaav ladi congress arse baad rajya kii mukhya vipakshi party ban gai thi
 But due to the politics of the Center, sometimes he has to look for the left, sometimes with the Trinamool
 isi kaa phayda uthaakar bijepi mukhya vipakshi kii bhoomika hathiyanna chaahati he
 In this case, the Congress has been doing Trinamool action
 ab tak congress ke 12 vidhayak congress chhod trinmul kaa daaman tham chuke hai
 Prior to this, former Congress President Manas Bhuiyan also moved to Trinamool, which recently Mamata made Rajya Sabha MP
 congressiyon ke trinmul main jane kii baat par pradesh adhyaksh adheer ranjan ne kaha, 'mamata dabaav or laalach donon tareekon kaa istemaal kar congress korajya menkhatm karnaa chaahati hai
 However, at the same time, he also says that in today's era, whatever the high command decides on the issue of compromise in terms of the larger politics of the Center, we will accept it

 Former Maharashtra CM, rebel Shiv Sena and Bahubali Narayan Rane of Congress are in further trouble after losing the assembly
 bandra purv vidhansabha upachunaav main unhen congress ne ummidavaar banaaya he
 Bandra has been the bastion of the erstwhile Shiv Sena and Matoshri is Thackeray's home here
 isi matoshri ne kabhi narayan rane ko siem banaaya tha, or isi matoshri ko chhod rane siem pad kii aas main congress main shaamil hue
 He also rebelled several times in the Congress, demanding his cm's stance and perceived force, but Rane lost the 2014 assembly election by losing his traditional seat
 bandra seat par ladane kaa mauqaa unhen isliye mila kyonki vahaan ke shivasena vidhayak kii mrityu ke baad seat khaali hui
 But Rane made it clear that he did not have his own desire to fight in Bandra, considering the high command, Rane has accepted the challenge after 20 days
 kabhi siem banane ke khwaab dekhte rane chunki aaj vidhayak bhi nahin he, unhen ye chunauti anmane sweekaar karne ke alaava chaara bhi nahin tha
