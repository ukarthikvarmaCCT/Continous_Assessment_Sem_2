 In an interview with Hindustan Times, Sanjeev Goenka called Dhoni a brilliant player but said Australian captain Steven Smith was one step ahead of him
 dhoni se ek kadam aage hai smithshuukravaar ko sanjeev goyanka ne hindustan times se kaha, “jitne logon se maine abtak baat kii he unamem emes dhoni sabase zyada dimagdar insaan hai or vah duniya main sabase behtareen wicketiper hai lekin smith unase ek kadam aage hai
 i told Smith to win this championship and the result is in front
 ”smith kii ranneeti avishwasanibhi tak sanjeev ke bhai harsh ne twitor par anti-dhoni post daalate hue bavaal machaaya hua tha or ab frenchiji ke top bos ne hi dhoni ko lekar tanj kas diya he
 Sanjeev Goenka said, "it is difficult to believe the way Smith planned to dismiss some batsmen
" iske alaava jis kushalta or dridhtaa se unhone mushkil halaat kaa saamana kiya or sirf jeet kaa ravaiya unhone team ke khilaadiyon main bharaa, usne hi puri team ko ek ikai main piro diya
 He went to meet the batsmen in a strategic time out and asked him to either hit 30 off 12 balls or get out
 hamaari kharaab shuruyaat isliye hui thi kyonki smith pet kharaab hone ke kaaran baahar rahe the
 Goenka added, "you have to win around 8 to 9 matches to make it to the playoffs and Smith told me that with me, Tahir and Stokes, they will win seven matches and MS Dhoni's potential players will always give you They give something

 Another day of boiling rage on the streets and squares, another media feast on the bad news-laden street, another day of discussion for the morals at the dining table
 
 
 yah sab uske jane-pahachaane manjar the, or use bakhubi pataa tha ki savera hote hi sab bhula diya jayega
 He knew that his rule would prevail in the dark atmosphere of this unhappy India
 lekin savera hota he, 2013 kaa pehla savera, or uski shakl kuch badali hui he
 He has a shadow of fear in his eyes, and the haphazard noise of his confused alphas in the carcass of political voices scares him
 vah rosemara kii siyasat kii andheri surang main itane gahare pabast he ki use khidki se baahar sadakon par failata ujaalaa nahin dikhataa
 Perhaps he is not used to such a world
 jaahir he, uske darane kii vajah jaij he
 In 2013, the arena of politics is going to be built in an India where all the stakes of its leaders will be completely meaningless
 kshetreey kshatrap or rashtriya diggajave khantee raajnneeti kii taatkalikta main itane gahare dhanse hue hai ki bhaawanaaon ke ubhaar kii vyapaktaa ko nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 For them, it is time for the 2014 general elections to devise the same sloganeering slogans that they aspire to put on their lost reputation
 aap dekhie ki kaise kuch badi machhliyon samet moti chamadi ke chhitput netaa sab ek saath khud ko kaddavar dikhaane main lag gaye hai or pradhanmantri naam kii kentul se apni kaaya ko taul rahe hai
 Just look at how the conspiracies to sit on the plinth and topple the plank are taking cohesion together across the veil of political deceit
 ye sari kavayad hamaari jaani-pahachaani he, shaq yaa bhram kii koi gunjaaish nahin honi chahie
 It is a fight between the infamous and the misleading; The fight is real and fake, between the inherited throne and its snoopers
 ye ladaaiyaan darasal khandit bhartiya raajnneeti ke aaine main apane aks ke mukaable praayshchitt kii ghadi se ain pehle kahin behatar dikhne kii chahat se upjengi
 It is time for all of them to decorate, and they are obliged to do so
 apane raaj ke nauven saal main chal rahi sattarudh upie ke paas bhavishya kii ladaai kaa sirf ek cheharaa he-kabhi halaki badi dadhi main chupa to kabhi safachat, lekin hameshaa kam jaahir
 Anyway, after Rajiv Gandhi's era in dynastic politics, political impact was never measured by sight or hearing
 is saal haalanki rahul gandhi ko zyada dikhnaa hoga or bolnaa bhi hoga, taaki unhen suna ja sake
 In late 2012, the young heir of India's oldest great party was not present on the road to share the anger of young India; He refused to be part of the fight for justice and respect for life
 vah judaa bhi, to uske dimag main kya chal rahaa tha, yah bharat kabhi jaan nahin paaya
 Now that the transfer of power from mother to son has been a mere formality, the elected future of the Congress will have to be proved whether it is even worth the future of India or not
 aisa hone ke liye unke paas koi aisa sandesh hona chahie jo unki peedi kii aakankshaon or ummiido ke saath sur main ho
 However, Rahul has not given any such indication so far
 kya turat-phurat kii raajnneeti kii jarurat se vah sandesh paidaa hoga? yaa phir, 2013 main ve apni vaicharik viraasat kii diwaar ko todakar hamen chaunkaayenge? unke bheetar gandhi kaa khun he, unhen satta main rahane ke liye kisi pad kii darkaar nahin
 This gives them a special kind of freedom
 ab tak unhone is aazaadee kaa chunavi istemaal shaayad hi kabhi kiya he
 As Rahul is on his way to becoming the next largest leader of the party, his impact will be measured at the national level
 aam chunaav se pehle kuch choti ladaaiyaan rajyon main bhi hai jahaan ve apane kulanaam ko bhunaane kaa kaam kar sakate hai, masalan, madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh or dilli
 What if there is a meeting of all the self-styled and eccentric people with him? is kaam main unki madad ko koi nahin aane vaala
 Only thoughts can help them
 unhen kuch vichaar chahie or jaahir he pradhanmantri yaa kisi duusare bujurg se vichaar udhaar lenaa kisi kaam nahin aayega
 Just imagine that Rahul Gandhi is standing on the stage with Delhi's suddenly infamous Chief Minister Sheila Dixit or the ever-maligned Ashok Gehlot
 sabak? 2013 main jo tufaan umadaye vaala he, usase nibatane kaa ek hi tarika he bharat ke netaaon ke liye-alag ho jaao yaa phir badanaami jhelo
 There are some leaders within the Congress who are aspiring for Rahul to become Manmohan Singh
 chote-chote sangharsh unke bich bhi dekhne ko milenge
 He is happy that even if the Congress came to power in 2014 with less than a majority of seats, the prince would follow his mother's footsteps to choose his prime minister and hold the reins of power
 is saal agar ve desh kaa bharosa jeetne main naakaam bhi rahe to kya, kuch congressi netaa kam-se-kam desh ke bhavishya yani rahul kaa bharosa jeetne kii kavayad jarur karenge
 See, the gestures of the Finance Minister have suddenly started showing some improvement
 lekin unhen jald hi party ke bheetar se chunauti milane vaali he
 Equally complex is the struggle on the right side of the political corridor, where the heroism of Narendra Modi, the biggest visible brand of Indian right, has crossed the border of Gujarat
 bikhare hue janadesh vaale ek raashtra main ek prashaasak ke taur par asaadhaaran kamyaabi ke boote modi kii rashtriya mahatvakanksha hilore maar rahi he
 This achievement has transformed his struggle within his party and within Modi itself into a rare scene in India's politics
 haalanki bharat ke bhavishya ke netaa ke taur par unki sweekaaryata ko unki lokapriyata se nahin mapa ja saktaa he
 Confession vs
 Appeasement 2013 is an opportunity for Modi to put himself in front of the bjp's human face and do middle-class politics, as did Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 raajnneeti main yah mekaover sabase zyada phydemand sabit hoga or iske liye bas itnaa karne kii jarurat he ki ve 2002 kii barbar ghatnaon ke liye maafee maang len
 It would be nothing like admitting a mistake, but a step towards increasing his stature which would naturally make him the biggest acceptable leader of the BJP
 madhyavargeey bharat kaa dil jeetne ke liye 2013 main modi ko badlaav kaa sabase bada udhaaharan pesh karnaa hoga: jab tak modi khud ko nahin badalenge, kisi bhi badlaav kaa koi matlab nahin hoga
 Change needs to be given a new meaning today and Indian politics has no way of doing so at the moment
 saamaajik nyaay ke tathakthith thekedaar badlaav kii buniyaad se kaaphi dur nikal aae hai
 Today, they have become merchants of regional politics, whose support will go to the highest bidder
 len-dein kii yahi sanathan raajnneeti he jo mayawati, mulaayam singh or karunanidhi jaise netaaon ko kamobesh tikaae hue he
 These are bargain masters, and how far a deal of revenge, alliances or appeasement will go will be determined by their position on the table of agreement
 uttar pradesh kii siyasat main donon sanathan pratidwandvi 2013 main upie kii buree kismat main apni gotiyaan chamakaane kii bharsak koshish karenge
 Manmohan Singh may be preparing for retirement after his second faint tenure, but he is desperate to regain his lost radiance just a little
 2013 main unki kamajori hi dusron ko siyaasi maukey muhaiyaa karaayegi
 Now the question is whether Arvind Kejriwal, the last common man standing in front of TV cameras and pointing fingers at corrupt leaders, will not become one among them? The new leader of the country and who has been in the headlines for the past year, this angry person looks somewhat wistful on the new year
 nai peedi ke saath kadamtal karne ke liye use media priy khoji raajnneeti ke paar janaa hoga
 The angry young man on the road is uncomfortable with the utopian alternative (ideal state or Ram Rajya) of village Swaraj
 kejariwal ke saath bhi kisi duusare netaa kii tarah hi apraasangik kar die jane kaa khatra laga hua he
 Politics becomes a moment of liberation when it is firmly rooted towards raw paths and when songs of enthusiasm are sung here instead of Murcier
 nae saal kii beraunak purv sandhya ke hangover ke saath bharat 2013 kii yatra par jaise-jaise aage bad rahaa he, sadak par aa chuki aazaadee kii ladaai main uske paas sirf ek aujaar bachaa he or vah he ummid

 Congrats @aaysharma Now is the time for a lot of mehnat aur lagan
 Wish you all success God Bless # aayushsharma australia ke khilaaf super-8 main karaari haarake baad team india ko ab tii-20 world cap ke semifinal main pahunchane kii apni ummiido ko jinda rakhane ke liye ravivaar kochir pratidwandvi pakistanko kisi bhi keemat par haraana hi hoga
 For India, it will be a 'do or die' match, while Pakistan are in a better position to beat South Africa in Super-8
 team india australia ke khilaaf bilkul bhi farm main nahin dikhi thi or toornament main vaapasi ke liye jaruri hoga ki mahendra singh dhoni ke dhurandhar apni galatiyon se sikh le unhen is match main naa doharaaen
 The preparation of the players before the indo-pak match was a hit for the five bowlers of India against England in the group matches, but in the last night's match against Australia, Dhoni's frontline spinners were washed away by the pair of Shane Watson and David Warner
 
 dhoni ne apane gendbaajon kii asafalataa ke liye australian pari ke shuru main hui halki boondabandi ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 But the truth is that the entire bowling unit failed to challenge
 aar aswin se lekar piyush chawla tak har gendbaaj ne phul tas or kharaab genden phenki jo australia kii is visphotak jodi ke liye phydemand sabit hui
 Although Dhoni can stick to his five bowlers' tactics, it would be a surprise if he gives leg-spinner Chawla another chance for the tournament
 chawla bane team india ke liye 'chintaa'pakistani team main spin gendbaaji ke lihaaj se sarvshereshth khilaadi maujuud hai or chawla kii gendbaaji main nirantarata nahin dikhi he
 If players of the Pakistani team like Imran Nazir, Nasir Jamshed and Mohammad Hafeez get into their rhythm, they will blow the bowling of Chawla
 dhoni ne suzav diya tha ki premdasa kii pich par dhimi genden prabhaavshaalee hongi, jiskaa matlab he ki lakshmipathi balaji jaisaa gendbaaj prabhavi ho saktaa he
 There are still concerns about the batting in the Indian team on the return of Veeru and it will be interesting to see if Dhoni continues to field Irfan Pathan as an opener keeping Virender Sehwag out or Viru returns to the team
 iskaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki bhartiya ballebaaj abhi tak toornament ke teen maichon main keval saat chakke jad paae hai jabaki watasan ne akele hi bharat saat chakke jamaaye the
 However, some serious questions can be asked regarding Yuvraj Singh's inclusion in the team
 chayankartaaon ne cancer se ubarne ke baad bhaavnaatmak faisla karte hue unhen team main shaamil kiya or har match main sabit ho rahaa he ki is pratibhashali baayen haath ke ballebaaj ko antarrashtriya vaapasi se pehle gambhir rup se kuch match abhyaas karnaa chahie tha
 Batting concern for Pakistan too, the Pakistani team would like to improve their batting because they were able to defeat South Africa with the excellent batting of Umar Gul and Omar Akmal
 dakshin africa ke khilaaf unhone chaar spinneron kaa istemaal kiya tha lekin bharat ke khilaaf shaayad ve raja hasan ko nahin khilaaen
 Captain Mohammad Hafeez, Shahid Afridi and Syed Ajmal will be in the team, but it is possible that Pakistan can feed Mohammad Sami who can prove useful
 pakistan ke liye afridi kaa balle se niraashajanak pradarshan sabase badi samasya he
 Both teams: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Gautam Gambhir, r Ashwin, Laxmipathy Balaji, Piyush Chawla, Ashok Dinda, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Virat Kohli, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, Virender Sehwag, Rohit Sharma, Manoj Tiwari and Yuvraj
 Lion
 pakistan:mohammad hafeez (captain), imran nazeer, kamran akmal, shahid afridi, shoeb malik, nasir jamshed, said ajmal, sohail tanwir, umr akmal, umr gul, yasir araafaat, abdul rajjak, mohammad sami, asad shafiq or raja hasan

 Therefore, this statement is important because this statement of America also becomes important because America's Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will soon travel to Beijing, it is noteworthy that China is the biggest obstacle in India's entry into the NSG group
 america ke state department ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki america enesji group main bharat kii phul membership kaa puri tarah se samarthan karata he, hamen yakeen he ki bharat iske liye puri tarah se taiyaar he

 The 34th match of IPL season 12 between Delhi Capitals (DC) and Mumbai Indians (MI) will be played at Ferozeshah Kotla Stadium in Delhi
 donon timen apane-apane pichley maichon main jeet hasil karne ke baad aa rahi hai
 Both teams also have 10–10 points
 dilli ne apane aakhri teen maichon main royal chalangers bengalooru, kolkata nite rides or sunrisers hyderabad ko patkhni di he
 However, there is lack of consistency in the Mumbai team
 vah apane pichley match main kings ilevan punjab ko maat dene ke baad aa rahi he
 However, the match between the two teams on Thursday will be different as both teams have to face the slow pitch of Kotla which is not easy by any means
 mumbai ke ballebaaj un vikaton par khilne ke aadi hai jahaan gend achche se balle par aati he
 The Delhi team also has some good stroke-making batsmen like Shikhar Dhawan, Prithvi Shaw and Rishabh Pant
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki donon tiimon ke ballebaaj kis tarah se pich se talmail baithaate hai
 It will also be interesting to see how Pant takes this match after not getting a place in the World Cup squad
 sabhi ko pant ke england main hone vaale vishwa cap main khilne kii ummid thi lekin dinesh karthik kaa anubhav or behatar wicketcaping yogyata pant ko pachhad gai
 Although Pant is still of age, but it will not be easy to get out of such a rash
 pant kis tarah se chayankartaaon ko jabaav dete hai yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 Delhi seems to be a team that has come into form at the right time
 lagaataar teen jeet se use aatmavishvaas mila he jo mumbai ke khilaaf uske kaam aayega
 Delhi however cannot take Mumbai lightly in any way as they have good bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah, Lasith Malinga and Krunal Pandya
 vahiin ballebaaji main rohit sharma, quinton di cock or hardik pandya hai jo teji se ran banaate aa rahe hai
 The last match at this ground was played between Delhi and Sunrisers Hyderabad, in which Delhi head coach Ricky Ponting and the rest of the team management expressed disappointment over the wicket
 ab dekhne hoga ki is baar pich curator kis tarah kii pich banaate hai
 The curator has got plenty of time for this, but there is definitely no possibility of a fast wicket as it will require grass on the wicket which is not much on the pitch of Kotla

 Buddha Purnima Day is celebrated to attain the enlightenment of Lord Buddha
 is din ko boddha dharm ke log hi nahin, balki hindu dharm ke log bhi badi dhooma-dham se manaate hai
 As a matter of fact, according to Hinduism, Buddha is the 9th incarnation of Lord Vishnu, so this festival is also very special for Hindu religious people
 piem modi buddha poornima samaaroh main shaamil hone may main jaaenge srilankakya he is parv kii kahani
 When Lord Buddha came to know about violence, sin and death in his life, he gave up his fascination and was freed from his home life and went in search of this harsh truth of life
 lakhon saal bodhgaya main bodhi vriksh ke neeche tapasya kar jab unhen is gyaan kii prapti hui to yah din puri sristi ke liye khaas din ban gaya jise baishakh poornima yaa buddha poornima ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 How is it celebrated? This is the biggest festival for the people who believe in the celebrated religion

 ) The Delhi government on Wednesday fired several arrows simultaneously to keep the officers on its side
 sabase pehle usne dilli sarkaar main principal secretary services rahe anindo majumdaar ko aakhirkaar nayaa vibhaag dete hue dilli financiel corporation kaa siemdi niyukt kar diya
 Anindo Majumdar is the only officer who appointed Shakuntala Gamlin as acting chief secretary on the orders of LG, while the Delhi government said that the appointment was made without her consent and Anindo Majumdar was removed from the post for appointment
 iske baad alji ne dilli sarkaar kaa aadesh radd karne or majumdaar ko behaal karne kaa aadesh diya, lekin sarkaar ne maanane se manaa kar diya or majumdaar ke daftar par taala jad diya tha
 LG later gave the order again, but the government said that LG did not have the authority to give such orders and when the dispute went long, the Ministry of Home Affairs brought the notification
 afasaron main naaraazgi or duvidha kii sthiti utpann ho gai thi, jisase dilli sarkaar inkaar nahin kar pai or phir lagaataar afasaron likhit aadesh dene ke saath-saath bharosa banane ke liye afasaron ke saath meeting shuru ho gai
 On Wednesday, while giving a statement in the Delhi Legislative Assembly in Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that the officers are feeling like pistachio between two pots of mill and we are doing what we can for the officers on our behalf
 , But the central government is troubling
 tippaniyan Not only this, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said that no Delhi officer needs to be afraid
 kejariwal ne kaha ki "is tarah kii baaten chal rahi hai bhram failaayaa ja rahaa he jaise agar afasar centre kii baat nahin maanenge to unako tankhwaah nahin milegi, aap apana kaam eemaandaaree se karte jaaen, majaal he koi aapaki tankhwaah roak de? ham denge aapako tankhwaah ye vidhansabha degi aapako tankhwaah
 " dilli sarkaar jaanati he ki vah chaahe kuch bhi kare yaa kahe lekin agar afasarshahi uskaa saath nahin degi to sarkaar chalati bhale hi rahe, lekin sushasan or dilli ko model shahar banane kaa daawa vah puraa nahin kar paaegi
 And anyway, the Aam Aadmi Party has made its enemies so much that if it is not able to meet the officers, then understand that the officers should not do more damage than the other enemies
 anindo majumdaar hi vah adhikari hai, jinhone shakuntla gammlin ko alji ke aadesh par kaaryvahak mukhya sachiv niyukt kar diya jabaki dilli sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki ye niyukti bina uski sahmati ke hui or niyukti ke liye anindo majumdaar ko pad se hataa diya gaya
 The LG then ordered the Delhi government to cancel the order and reinstate Majumdar, but the government refused to oblige and locked Mazumdar's office
 alji ne baad main phir aadesh diya, lekin sarkaar ne kah diya kii alji ko adhikaar hi nahin aise aadesh dene kaa or jab vivaad lanbaa chalaa to grih mantralay notification le aayaa
 a situation of resentment and dilemma had arisen among the officers, which the Delhi government could not deny and then started meeting with the officers to give the officers written orders as well as to build trust
 buudhvaar ko dilli ke up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya main dilli vidhansabha main bayaan dete hue kaha ki afasar ek tarah se chakki ke do paat ke bich pista hua sa mahasoos kar rahe hai or ham apni taraf se afasaron ke liye jo kar sakate hai kar rahe hai, lekin centre sarkaar pareshaan kar rahi he
 The comments yahi nahin dilli ke siem aravind kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli ke kisi afasar ko darane kii zarurat nahin he
 Kejriwal said that "these kinds of things are going on and confusion is being spread as if the officers do not listen to the Center, they will not get their salary, you should do your work honestly, is there any way to stop your salary? We will give you Salary: This assembly will give you salary
 " The Delhi government knows that whatever it does or says, but if the bureaucracy does not support it, then the government may continue to run, but it will not be able to fulfill the claim of making good governance and Delhi a model city
 or vaise bhi aam aadmi party ne apane dushman itane banaae hue hai ki agar afasaron se nahin pat pai to samajhiye ki baaki dushman se zyaada nuksaan kahin afasar hi na kar den
 The LG then ordered the Delhi government to cancel the order and reinstate Majumdar, but the government refused to oblige and locked Mazumdar's office

 soshal media par urmila ko lekar alag-alag daawey kiye ja rahe hai
 Some claim that Urmila is the niece of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, while some claim that Urmila converted her religion by marrying Mohsin Akhtar Mir and her real name is now "maryam Akhtar Mir" or 'farzana Khan' is
 india today anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne apni jaanch main paaya ki ye sabhi daawey galat hai
 On social media, the symbol of the post was posted by a person named Mr
 Anurag which read "urmila Matondkar, niece of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat (farzana Khan) joined Congress after marrying Kashmiri"
 is post ko 34 soshal media yuzars ne ab tak share kiya he
 On the same post, a social media user named Kanak Mishra has claimed, "urmila Matondkar will contest from Congress! Urmila accepted Islam and married her 9 years younger to Mohsin Akhtar Mir, a Kashmiri business man, and named her Maryam Akhtar Mir! But Urmila Matondkar will be written to make Hindus $ # @ on the election leaflet! ”india Today anti-fake News War Room investigated its social media profile of Urmila Matondkar
 instagram or fasebuk, donon par urmila kaa acount he jisame unka naam yahi he jisase wo jaani jaati he
 There are no photos of Urmila and Mohan Bhagwat together on Facebook and Instagram
 india today anti phek news war room ne urmila se sidhe mohan bhagwat se rishton par sawaal poocha to wo hairaan ho gai or saaf inkaar kiya
 Urmila said, 'this thing went beyond even a film script, there is no truth in it
 'vahiin is daawey kii duusari baat ki kya urmila ne dharm parivartan kiya he or uske baad naam badla he
 We also investigated this, it is true that Urmila married a Kashmiri businessman Mohsin Akhtar Mir in 2016
 mohsin bollywood main chota motaa role bhi kar chuke hai
 Urmila has uploaded many photos with her husband Mohsin to her social media account
 is mudde par jab hamane sidhe mohsin se hi poochi to unhone kaha, 'is tarah ke daawey chunaav se pehle kiye jate hai par hamen isse koi fark nahin padataa
 My wife did not convert
 aap unke instagram acount par dekh sakate hai ki duusare stars kii tarah unhone na apana naam badla he or na hi meraa sarnem apane naam ke aage lagaaya he
 If you come to our house, you will see that there is a temple in our house
 hamaare ghar main kaam karanevaale log bhi aapako bataa denge kii urmila ne apana dharm parivartan nahin kiya he
 'there is no legal obligation to convert religious conversion and her husband Mohsin herself is saying this, then it can be assumed that Urmila did not convert

 Batting at his favorite number three, Bell also completed his career's 15th Test century with two runs off Sreesanth

 In addition to hitting three fours on Sreesanth, he also sent Harbhajan's ball for four runs

 Meanwhile, there was a dispute over Bell's run-out but Dhoni showed the spirit of the game and called back the opposing batsman
 morgan ne harbhajan kii gend par sidhaa chakka jadkar 60 gend main apane karier kaa teesraa ardhashatak puraa kiya
 Bell, however, returned to the pavilion after improvised spinner Yuvraj Singh

 Praveen then also caught Morgan in the hands of Dhoni
 unhone 88 gend kii apni pari main aath chauke or ek chakka maaraa
 Jonathan Trott, who suffered a shoulder injury during the Indian innings, was lucky on the next ball when umpire Marais Erasmus turned down Pravin's credible appeal of a lbw

 Trott however could not take advantage of this and Praveen caught him in his next over by Rahul Dravid

 Vicky Kaushal did a brilliant job in many films in 2018
 unhone netcrilaks kii pehali hindustani romantic-kamedi lav par squaire foot main or phir short filmon kii anthology last stories se darshakon ke dil jeet liye
 In Raazi, he played a calm and strong performance and in Sanju, Ranbir Kapoor competed equally
 donon filmein hit raheen
 And at the end of the year, he earned lavish accolades for playing a bad boyfriend in Manmargiyaan
 par sapanom sareekha yah saal ab bhi kaushal ke sar nahin chadha he
 He says, "I am happy to gain the trust of the directors i dreamed of working with
" logon kaa dil bahalane vaala hone ke naate aap hameshaa zyada se zyada darshakon tak pahunchnaa chaahate hai
 Luckily, this year could be a part of such films
 yah mujhe apni hadon se bhi aage jane ke liye prerit karata he
 Recently, it has been announced that he will play the notorious Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in Takht
 diarect karan johar kii yah drama film 2020 main relies hogi
 Releasing on January 11, his 2019 debut action thriller Uri: The Serie Tomorrow Strike will prove to be his wrong move? In the trailer, it is being criticized on social media due to the overwhelming anti-pakistan rhetoric
 kaushal aalochana kaa swaagat karte hue kehete hai, ‘‘film kaa kaam hi charchaa chhedia he,’’ haalanki ve chaahate hai ki log aakhri raay banane se pehle puri film jarur dekh len
 Kaushal has played the role of Major Vihaan Shergill

 On getting the script of Uri, he had to struggle to convince himself that he can take the aura and personality of the army officer on screen
 unhone boot-camp training or dhyaan vidhiyaan apanaain
 Casting director Atul Mongia revealed that his breathing is different from military
 yahaan unki kasarat kaam ai
 Soon he began to feel attached to the character
 *** Kulbhushan Jadhav will cover the lies of Pakistan on February 18 next year
 international court(icj) main agle varsh 18 se 21 farvari takkulbhushan jadhavpar sunwaayee hogi
 This hearing will be held in two rounds
 pehle bharat ko isamen apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka diya jayega, uske baad pakistan apni baat rakhega
 On 18 February 2019, India will get a chance to speak in the first round from 10 am to 1 pm
 agle din yani 19 ko pakistan kaa number hoga
 He too will be given time from 10 am to 1 pm
 duusare round main 20 farvari ko dopaher teen se saadhe chaar baje tak bharat ko jabaki pakistan ko 21 farvari ko shaam saadhe chaar se 6 baje tak apana paksh rakhane kaa samay mukarrar kiya gaya he
 Even after the formation of Imran Khan's government in Pakistan, his attitude has not behaved
 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne agast main daawa kiya tha ki bhartiya naagarik kulbhushan jadhav ke khilaaf pakistan ke paas ‘thos saboot’ hai or use antarrashtriya adaalat main uske khilaaf maamle main jeetne kii ummid he
 Significantly, 47-year-old Jadhav was sentenced to death in April 2017 by a Pakistan military court on charges of espionage
 bharat ne usee varsh may main us faisle ke khilaaf antarrashtriya adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 The international court stayed the execution of Jadhav on India's appeal
 pakistan kaa kahana he ki uske suraksha balon ne jadhav ko baluchistan praant se march 2016 main tab giraftaar kiya tha jab vah kathith rup se iran se desh main ghuse the
 Pakistan has said in the international court that Jadhav is not a normal person, but he entered the country with the intention of espionage and sabotage
 vahiin bharat ne shuru se hi in aaropon se inkaar kiya he or kaha he ki jadhav kaa apharan iran se kiya gaya tha jahaan vah nausena se sevanivrutt hone ke baad apane vyapaar ke silsile main rah rahe the, lekin unka sarkaar se koi sampark nahin tha
 On September 18 in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi was seen watering the Shivling in large posters along the road
 kailash maansarovar kii 12 din kii yatra ke baad laute congress adhyaksh ne us roj vidhansabha chunaav vaale is rajya main badi raily kii
 Though he did not invoke any religious sentiments, the posters made it clear through this new "shiv Bhakta" that the Congress stands on the threshold of "soft Hindutva"
 bahusankhyak matadaataaon ko rijhaane ke liye keval congress hi nahin balki trinmul congress, samaajawaadee party (sapa) or yahaan tak ki vampanthi partiyaan bhi dharm ke usee maarg par chalati najar aa rahi hai, jiske liye ve bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko kosti rahi hai
 In fact, the success of the BJP has taught these parties the lesson of wooing majority voters in the name of religion
 or yah besabab nahin he
 Take a look: BJP, called Hindutvaist, won a landslide victory with 282 seats in the Lok Sabha by securing nearly 17 crore votes
 phir teen saal baad march 2017 main usne uttar pradesh vidhansabha kaa chunaav bhi baari bahumat se jeet liya
 In this largest state of the country, BJP was able to win 71 seats in 80 Lok Sabha and 312 out of 403 assembly seats
 pradesh ke ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan kaa mudda party ke 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke ghoshnaptr or agenda main tha
 During this time, the party fiercely played the card of Hindutva and was successful in religious polarization
 misaal ke taur par bhaajapa ne jagah-jagah prachaar kiya ki siyaasi partiyaan hindu votaron ko rijhaane kii jagah alpsankhyak (mukhya rup se musalmaan) vot bank par apni pakad banane main jute raheen
 Opposition party leaders also helped with this notion
 misaal ke taur par, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan mulaayam singh yadav ne banaras kii ek raily main kaha ki jo log mujffarnagar dangon ko lekar sawaal uthaa rahe hai kya ve bataa sakate hai ki musalamaanon kii madad sapa se zyada kisne kii he
 Such statements further fueled polarization
 aise main pichley loksabhaa or uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ne spasht kar diya bhaajapa ne hindutv ko apane centre main rakhte hue apni virdohi partiyon ke muslim vot bank ko prabhavi nahin hone diya (muslim vot bhaajapa virdohi dalon main bant gaye)
 Therefore, anti-bjp parties have intensified the advocacy of Hindu Gods and Goddesses, so that Hindu voters do not get angry
 mukhya vipakshi dal congress ke adhyaksh rahul ke khud kii hindu dharm main aasthaa dikhaane or kailash maansarovar se lekar vibhinn mandiron kii yatra karne ko bhi isi rup main dekha ja rahaa he, haalanki rahul sansad main spasht kar chuke hai ki unhen hindutvvaadi nahin balki hindu dharm main aasthaa he
 BJP national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member GVL Narasimha Rao says, "the leaders of the parties who are leading the Muslim appeasement are suddenly going to the temple only because they have started doing politics of religion
 vamapanthiyon se lekar mamata banerjee tak mandir jane lagi hai
 This is good, but politics in the name of religion is not right
 '' yah digar baat he ki bhaajapa khud hindutv ko apane agenda main rakhti he
 Even backward ideologies, despite ideological contradictions, have made their stance flexible about the temple and Hinduism
 gods on country kahe jane vaale kerala main sitambar, 2017 main ldf sarkaar ke devswam mantri ke
 Surendran reached the Guruvayur Temple in Thrissur
 kerala ke vampanthi sarkaar main shaayad pehla mauka tha jab sarkaar ke ek mantri na sirf mandir pahunche balki vahaan puja-archana bhi kii
 BJP leaders called it a good move, but also called it an attempt to woo Hindu voters
 vivaad hone par vampanthi sarkaar kuch had tak baikfoot par ai or makapa ne is maamle par ek cameti bana di
 Sources say, "according to the ideology of the party, the minister doing so is not only removed from the government but also shown the way out of the party
 '' lekin cameti ne mantri ko na to hataane kii sifarish kii, na hi mantri ke mandir jane kii ninda kii
 Just warning them, the committee said in its report, "it is not wrong for Surendran to go to the temple as a minister but worshiping there is not compatible with the principles of the party
" '' jaahir he, ek tarah se party ne vampanthi netaaon yaa mantriyon ko mandir jane kii maun sweekruti pradaan kar di
 On the other hand, Kerala BJP President PS Sreedharan Pillai says, "actually the Left parties have come to know that their work will not work without Hindu vote
 kerala sarkaar ko pataa he ki surendran par karrwai karne se hindu voter naaraaz ho jaaenge
 It is a reflection of the growing power of the BJP in the state that even the leftists who claim themselves as atheists are coming to the shelter of God
 '' ldf sarkaar kii yah mandir niti sidhe taur par hindu votaron ko lubhaane kii koshish bhale na dikhe par hindu votaron ko naaraaz hone se rokane kii koshish jarur dikhti he
 Similarly, in West Bengal, along with the leftist parties, bjp's anti-tmc chief and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee could not stop herself from declaring to celebrate Ram Navami by getting out of the politics of "wearing hijab" and "read kalma"
 
 bhaajapa pravaktaa raav kehete hai ki mamata banerjee ne 2017 main ramanavami kaa juluus nahin nikalne dene kaa farmaan jari kiya tha lekin achaanak unhen yah ehsaas hua ki hindu voter unase dur ja rahe hai to unhone is baar juluus nikaalane kaa aadesh apane kaaryakartaaon ko diya
 In 2014, Mamata Banerjee managed to stop the Modi wave in West Bengal
 khuleam muslim votaron kii pairokari karne vaali mamata jab 2016 main dobaaraa mukhyamantri baniin to unhone saraswati puja or murti-visarjan ke liye sthaan tay kiye jise bhaajapa ne puja par ankush lagane kii sajeesh bataai
 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, the following year, Mamta gave up the exercise to pave the way for immersion
 rajya ke panchayat chunaavon main bhaajapa ke prabhavi (20 fisadi seat hasil kar tiemasi ke baad duusare number kii party ban gai) pradarshan or uske badhate kader ko dekhte hue mamata ne apane rukh ko lacheela kiya he
 In March this year, he announced to celebrate Ram Navami
 unhone apane kaaryakartaaon or netaaon se kaha ki vah ramanavami kii yatra nikaalen or isamen hissaa len
 At the same time, exactly one year ago, he opposed the bjp's announcement to take out the Ram Navami procession
 pashchim bengal ke bhaajapa adhyaksh dilip ghosh kehete hai, "yah bhaajapa kii naitik jeet he ki mukhyamantri ko ramanavami manaane kaa faisla karnaa padaa
 He opposed it last year
 tiemasi ke jo log yah tark de rahe the ki bhagwaan ram kii puja bengal main hone kii parampara nahin rahi he vah darasal bengali or gaiyr-bengali hinduon main foot daalana chaahate hai
 The pomp with which Ramnavmi was celebrated did not let tmc's lies prevail
 '' jaahir he, 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar ranneetik taur par mamata ab durgapuja, saraswatipuja, ramanavami jaise tyohaar main tiemasi kaaryakartaaon ko shaamil hone ke liye kah rahi hai
 a TMC leader believes that Hinduism was being misconceived by opposition to a procession like Ramnavami
 khaskar bhaajapa jis tarah se tiemasi ko hindu virdohi party bataane main lagi thi usase tiemasi ko nuksaan hota
 Uttar Pradesh with 80 Lok Sabha seats is very important in the political strategy of the upcoming general election
 yahaan khud ko muslim votaron kii sabase badi hitaishi bataane vaali sapa bhi ab pramukhataa se hindu devi-devataaon kii baat karne lagi he
 SP President and former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav announced in August this year that if the SP government is formed in the state next time, they will build a grand Vishnu temple on the lines of Ankorwat temple in Cambodia
 unhone kaha, "sapa sarkaar aane par itawa main 2,000 acre bhoomi par vishnu kaa bhavy mandir banegaa
 a city will also be developed near the temple in the name of Lord Vishnu
 ''sapa kaa yah mandir raag party ke us ateet ko peeche chhod chukaa he jab sapa netaa or purv mukhyamantri mulaayam singh yadav ne kathith taur par babari masjid ko bachaane ke liye karsevakon par firing kaa aadesh diya tha or isko lekar hindutvvaadi use gherte rahe hai
 So far, the practice of wearing openly Hindutva dresses of the parties avoiding it is not limited to these sporadic states and local parties
 mukhya vipakshi dal congress ne pichley saal gujarat chunaav main muslim parast hone ke bhaajapa ke aaropon kii kaat ke liye rahul gandhi ne har mandir kedarshan kiye, khud ko shivbhakt ghoshit kar diya, to unke sipahsalaaron ne unhen janeudhari brahman ke rup main prachaarit kiya
 Now again in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Rahul has started going from temple to temple during the election campaign
 congress ke kaaryakartaaon ke bich jab rahul gandhi pahunch rahe hai to "har-har bhole or bam-bam bhole'' naare lag rahe hai
 Rahul's visit to the temple was also in the news during the Karnataka elections after Gujarat
 vahiin sansad ke monsoon satr se to rahul ne hindu dharm main apni aasthaa kaa khulkar izhaar shuru kar diya he
 Randeep Singh Surjewala, head of the Congress's media department, says, "the BJP tries to justify mob lynching and other unethical acts by calling itself a Hindutva party
 jabaki hindu dharm aisa nahin he
 There is no place for violence in Hinduism and Rahul Gandhi talks about that
 ''surajevaala ke mutabik, "jo log rahul gandhi ke shivbhakt hone yaa unke mandir jane kii aalochana karte hai, darasal unke pairon ke neeche se jameen khisak gai he
 If this was not the case, why would the BJP object to Rahul Gandhi's visit to the temple? Actually, BJP and RSS have been spreading the illusion that Congress is anti-hindu party for a long time
 ab unki sajeesh benakaab ho gai he isliye rahul ke mandir jane se bhaajapa ke log ghabara gaye hai
 "actually, the opposition parties want to blunt the bjp's strategy that creates an environment of polarization
 bhaajapa virdohi dal yah baat acchhee tarah se samajhate hai ki dhuvrikaran kii sthiti main khaskar hindi pattee main bhaajapa se muqabla karnaa kathin he
 There are 225 seats in the Lok Sabha in Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where the opposition wants to dent the bjp's core vote bank
 isliye vipakshi dal kisi bhi haal main bhaajapa ko yah mauka dena nahin chaahate ki vah in rajyon main vipakshi dalon ko muslim parast bataa sake
 Opposition parties, especially the Congress, have waged a soft Hindutva offensive to attack the BJP
 vah mob linching jaise mudde to bhaajapa ke khilaaf uthaa rahi he, lekin yah saavdhaanee bhi barat rahi he ki is chakkar main vah muslim tushtikaran karte hue na dikhe
 When Rahul Gandhi or Surjewala say that "our (congress's) Hindutva is not that of BJP or RSS", they want to show that Congress believes Hindutva which majority Hindus believe in which violence is prohibited
 
 iske jariye congress musalamaanon kaa bharosa bhi kaayam karnaa chaahati he or saath hi hinduon ko bhi naaraaz hone kaa mauka dena nahin chaah rahi
 Says a senior Congress leader, "by creating an atmosphere of polarization, the RSS people used the trick to keep the majority votes (hindu votes) united, while the anti-bjp parties used to talk about Muslim advocacy and Muslim votes were distributed among them
 BJP will not get the chance now
 '' beete do saal main vipakshi dalon ne aisa maahaul bana diya ki bhaajapa ko ab apane kor vot bank (hindu) ko ekajute rakhane main mushkil ho rahi he
 There is also resentment over issues like inflation, problem of farmers, dalit issue, unemployment to corrupt businessmen, and Rafael
 in sattavirohi rujhaan ke kaaran is baar hindu vot bank main bantwaare ko rokna bhaajapa kii sabase badi chunauti he
 But bjp's media department head and Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni says, "the Congress is in a dilemma that Rahul Gandhi will gain votes by calling himself a Shiva devotee
 bhaajapa ko na sirf hinduon balki musalamaanon kaa bhi vot milegaa
 BJP is contesting on the issue of development
 karnataka or gujarat main congress ko haraakar logon ne bataa diya ki janata modi ke saath he na ki rahul gandhi ke saath
 The RSS is also stunned by the race to make itself Hindu friendly among political parties
 sangh se jude netaaon kaa maananaa he ki "centre sarkaar ke liye yah behatar mauka he ki ayodhya main ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye anya dalon se baatcheet shuru kare
 "the Sangh hopes that in such a situation Amrai can be built on the Ram temple
" vibhinn dalon ke naram hindutv kaa rasta apnaane se bhaajapa ko chunauti mili na mili par bahusankhyak voton ke bantwaare kaa aadhaar taiyaar ho gaya he

 sharad pavaar raajnneeti ke jabardast khilaadi hai
 He does not do politics of principles
 vakt or saamne vaale kii haisiyat ke mutabik unka har kadam badhata he
 He comes to all the games of power and knows when to negotiate and when to keep the doors open
 jin sonia gandhi ko unhone videshi or na jane kya-kya kaha, unki party ke saath unhone sarkaar banaai
 He played an important role in that coalition government
 desh ke hit or ahit vaale sabhi faislon main ve saath rahe lekin ain vakt par unhone hawa kaa rukh tadte hue congress ko angootha dikhaa diya
 He knew that the public in Maharashtra was angry with him and the UPA and would vote for him less
 isliye unhone tamaam galatiyon ke liye congress ko jimmedaar tehraate hue usase kinaaraa kar liya
 Both his guess and gait were correct
 rajya main congress sikudakar tisare number kii party ho gai
 It is known that people of his party were involved in most of the big scams in Maharashtra
 desh main pyaaj or chini kii keemten andhadhundh badhane ke peeche koun tha, yah sabhi ko pataa he lekin sharad pavaar kii raajnneeti kuch aisi thi ki sara kaa sara dosha bahut safai se vah congress par madh gaye
 Now as soon as the BJP got close to the majority, he made a new move
 amuman aise vakt par raajnneetik dal or netaa tolmol karne lag jate hai lekin sharad pavaar ne turant bina shart samarthan dene kii ghoshnaa karke sabhi ko aashcharya main daal diya
 Actually the surprise factor is a big part of his politics
 yah unke pratidwindviyon ko un par haaavee nahin hone detaa he
 By the time they can understand something, Sharad Pawar has done his work
 is baar bhi aisa hi hua
 His statement hurt the Shiv Sena most, which wanted to put its conditions for re-alliance
 sharad pavaar ke bayaan ne shivasena ko kamazor kar diya or bijepi kii raah aasaan kar di
 But what is the motive behind this decision of NCP supremo is difficult to understand
 shaayad vah chaahate hai ki nai sarkaar un ghotaalon kii jaanch main jaldbaaji na kare yaa aisa kuch na kare jisase unhen vyaktigat rup se pareshaani ho
 He wants to buy time and at the same time wants to reduce bitterness
 vah nahin chaahate ki vipaksh main rahete hue unhen kisi tarah kii takalif ho
 However, it will not be possible to explain his move right now, but it is certain that he does not want to have any kind of enmity with the new government
 kai dashakon tak satta kaa swaad chakhne ke baad vah uskaa jaayaka nahin bigadane dena chaahate
 Now you call it politics of opportunism or something

 pashchimi dilli ke uttam nagar ilaake main ek shuukravaar kii shaam, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah chunaav raily ke liye pahunche hi hai
 Crowds and BJP workers are gathering around the stage that a man wearing a netanuma kurta walks from there, he goes out and looks for his vehicle here and there
 parichay poochne par unka ek sahyogi bataata he ki ve aresas prachaarak vishnu sharma hai, jo uttam nagar se satee janakapuri main amit shah kii agali chunaav raily kii vyavastha dekhne nikle hai
 Later Vishnu Sharma has to take part in two meetings — the meeting was to be held at Sangam Vihar and Badarpur in South Delhi with Union Minister in charge of the Booth Cluster Committee and BJP Parliamentary Board member Ananth Kumar, who along with Sharma was the election in-charge of Delhi Huh
 haalanki sharma or anant kumaar dilli ke rahane vaale nahin hai lekin dilli ke chunavi sangram main bijepi ke kendriya netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke saath prabandhan ke liye lagaae gaye hai
 BJP national president Amit Shah himself is fueling this election campaign
 or unka moolmantra he, micromanagement—aisa shaayad hi kabhi hota he ki sattarudh dal kaa adhyaksh dilli kii adana-si vidhansabha ke chunaav main itani badi bhoomika nibhaataa he, or saare prachaar prabandhan par itani baariki se najar rakhata he
 In this era of very political enthusiasts, the election of an assembly that does not have special importance in a small city-state like Delhi has suddenly become more important than last year's Lok Sabha elections
 isliye kendriya mantri bhale is vichaar par naak-bhun sikoden ki dilli ke vidhansabha chunaav modi sarkaar kii lokapriyata par raishumaari hai, lekin chunaav purv surveykshanon main arvind kejariwal or unki aam aadmi party (aap) ke paksh main baari jhukaav kii bhavishyavaanee ke baad shah ne inhen 70 siton ke liye bijepi or sangh parivaar ke netaaon kii puri fouj jhonk di he
 In these methods of election management, for the first time, Shah has also started the Panna Prahari system, which is being implemented vigorously
 is yojana ko bihar or uttar pradesh main bhi aajamaane kaa vichaar he
 Anant Kumar says that under this 1,24,000 panna in-charge are active in the city
 ye prabharee har matadaata ke paas matadaata register ke ek panne yani prishth par usase camel par muhar lagane kaa anurodh karte hai
 This system, which started in December last year, has been successful in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh for the past several years
 yojana ke anusaar kaam karne ke liye vibhinn rajyon se lagbhag 120 saansad bulaae gaye hai
 They are monitoring all the in-charges
 sabase badhkar khud shah isse jude hai
 Delhi BJP in-charge Prabhat Jha says, "this is the way Amit Shah contests elections on the strength of the party organization
" ve har kisi ko party kaaryakarta maanakar chalate hai, chaahe vah varisht netaa ho yaa kendriya mantri or unhen chunaav prachaar ke kaam main lagaate hai
 Jha also states that Shah himself is working 18 hours a day
 haalanki shah is baat se inkaar karte hai ki ve usase adhik bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai, jitani jaruri he
 "I was in Maharashtra for 14 consecutive days," he says
 main haryana main prachaar karata or maharashtra ke liye flite pakad letaa
 He would return to Haryana again the next morning
 ''lekin india today ke paas us paanch stareey vyavastha kaa khaakaa he, jise shah ne chunaav prabandhan ke liye bichaaya he (dekhen graphic)
 In this system, the role of Union Minister, Minister of bjp-ruled states and mps and mlas of other states, full-time workers are all set in detail
 iske alaava, rajya ikai ke netaa, dilli adhyaksh, jila adhyaksh, vidhansabha nirvachan kshetron ke prabharee, mandal adhyaksh, booth cameti or panna prahari shaamil hai
 Sharma, who is seen in a hurry in Uttam Nagar, is an RSS pracharak and is in charge of two Lok Sabha constituencies (which consists of 20 assembly constituencies)
 ve paanch stareey vyavastha ke tahat chunaav kaa vyapak prabandhan kar rahe hai
 The RSS pracharaks are in charge of the remaining five parliamentary constituencies (10 assembly seats under each) —mahendra Pandey, Rakesh Jain, Raghunath Kulkarni, Raghavendraji and Sher Singh
 iske neeche jila or vidhansabha str par do prabandhan ikaiyaan or kaam kar rahi hai; inamen kendriya mantri or bijepi ke purnakalik kaaryakarta hai
 These full-time workers from various states were called in Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir as soon as the election campaign was over
 janvari ke ant main shah ne jila or vidhansabha kshetra str par party netaaon kii do stareey vyavastha or banaai
 Not only this, Shah convened a full-time workers' meeting in the first week of January and inquired from them about the progress of grassroots campaigning
 in jamini aakalnon se jo tasviir saamne ai, vah shah ko khush karne vaali nahin thi
 Not only this, AAP campaigning with the help of volunteers and the cold response of the people at the public meeting of Prime Minister Modi at Ramlila Maidan on 10 January alerted the central leaders
 isi ke baad kaha jaataa he ki duusare rajyon main vidhansabha chunaavon ke vipareet yahaan mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Based on the same feedback, it was also decided that Shah should lead the election campaign himself
 so, unhone apane or party upaadhyaksh tathaa dilli prabharee prabhaat jha ke bich ke str ko mitaa diya
 After that, Shah went fast
 kul 100 ghanton ke soch-vichaar ke baad sabko hairat main daalate hue unhone kiran bedi, aap kii netaa shajia ilmi or vinod kumaar binni ko bijepi main shaamil kar liya
 Then, Krishna Tirath, a former Congress MP from north-west Delhi and a minister in the Manmohan Singh government, was also drawn into the BJP
 aakhir, 19 janvari ko kiran bedi ko bijepi kaa mukhyamantri ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya gaya
 When the local unit began to see resentment over Kiran's candidacy, Shah called a meeting of booth committees and emerald guards of the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi
 25 or 27 janvari ko ve sabhi netaaon or purnakalik kaaryakartaaon se mili or kaha ki ve tay karen ki panna prahari chunaav se pehle har ghar ke kam-se-kam chaar daure avashya karen
 But in a few days Kiran Bedi's boastfulness put the central leadership in worry
 bijepi ke ek kendriya netaa ne kaha, ''unhen kam bolnaa chahie tha
 Then, Modi and Shah began to reduce Kiran Bedi's discussion in their campaign speeches
 iske badale kejariwal par hamalaa tikhaa ho gaya
 In such a scenario, the script of the Delhi assembly elections began to be written on the lines of the Lok Sabha elections, when Modi's rivals were attacking Modi rather than his agenda
 isse modi ko khud ko peedit ke rup main pesh karne kaa mauka mil gaya
 What happened after that is history, which historians, political pundits and statisticians are still investigating
 to, kya is baar yah najaara ulat gaya? yaa shah kii chunavi mashin dilli ke chunaavon main karishma dikhaaegi? yahi sawaal aaj sabase bada he, jiske asar doorgaami ho sakate hai

 If anyone could understand Jawaharlal Nehru in a good way, then he was Mahatma Gandhi
 chatur sant or usase bhi hoshiyaar banieke taur par gandhi mahasoos kar chuke the ki rashtravaadi hero ke taur par uplabdh netaaon main se koi bhi unka uttaradhikari nahin ho saktaa
 Many leaders made their own recommendations for this role but they all lacked that ability
 gandhi ko in sabakaa doum laganaa swaabhaavik tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru was unique to Gandhiji only because of his ability to implement the bureaucracy of modernity
 unke jaise mahakavyatmak gun or aupnyasik baariki ko koi or nahin pradarshit kar saktaa tha
 Nehru became the incarnation of modernity
 unke jaisaa trutiheen tareeke kaa rajnatik, saundaryaparak or sadaachari aayam kisi or main nahin tha
 Even more beautiful was the attraction and pure exaltation brought through him
 agar aadhuniktaa ke liye koi auskar miltaa to nehru use har saal le jate
 There was no other politician anywhere in the world who provided metaphor, humanism and zeal to modernity like him
 nehru aadhuniktaa ko uski paribhaasha se bhi aage lekar gaye
 He gave more importance to spontaneity
 vah mistar modern the
 If there was evergreen man for modernity, he was Jawaharlal Nehru

 rajdhani dilli main dengue or chikgunia ko lekar kejariwal sarkaar ne hai court main die apane halafnaamein main ek baar phir doharaaya he ki 10 sitambar tak chikangunia se dilli main ek bhi maut nahin hui
 On Tuesday, Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain claimed that no person could be killed by Chikungunya
 dilli main ek ke baad ek chikangunia ke marijo kii maut kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 The Delhi government in its affidavit in the same Delhi High Court has claimed that till 10 September there has not been a single demise from Chikungunya in the capital Delhi
 iske alaava dilli sarkaar ne yachikakarta ke is daawey ko bhi thukraa diya ki dilli dengue se buree tarah prabhavit he
 Meanwhile, in view of the seriousness of the case, the Delhi High Court has asked the petitioner to explain in two days what steps should be taken by the Delhi government and civic agencies Kodengu and Chikungunya as well as prevention of malaria
 dilli main ab tak chikangunia ke 1057 marij saamne aevahin dilli sarkaar ne apane halafname main bataaya he ki 10 sitambar tak 1158 maamle saamne aae, jinamein 804 dilli or 354 dilli ke aspataalon main dilli se baahar ke aae hue marij the
 While 1057 patients of chikungunya have been reported in Delhi so far
 dilli sarkaar ne court main daawa kiya he ki dengue or chikangunia kii rokthaam ke liye dilli ke aspataalon main paryaapt bed or dawaaiyon kii vyavastha kii gai he

 20 sitambar ko agali sunwaayeedusri taraf yachikakarta kaa kahana he ki jamini hakeekat or dilli sarkaar ke daawey main jameen aasmaan kaa antar he
 Now on September 20, the Delhi High Court will hear the case again

 Ten days ago, after the resignation of Rahul Gandhi from the post of Congress President between Yes and No, UPA President Sonia Gandhi was made the Interim President of the Congress
 das din kaa samay koi zyada nahin hota lekin congress party ke bheetar or baahar donon jagah is baat kii charchaa he ki kuch bhi badla nahin he
 However, the question between all this is that Sonia Gandhi is the interim president and who is next? Not only this, another discussion is also being held for the second term of the Modi government and it is being said that the government is much stronger in the second term
 to vahiin congress ke liye tulana is prakaar ho rahi he ki modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal se kahin bure vakt main congress modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal main pahunch gai he
 Who will be the next president? Sonia Gandhi was given the command of the Congress in the year 1998 and she was the President till her first term till 2017
 is dauraan congress ne 2 baar loksabhaa chunaav jeeta or kai rajyon main apni sarkaar kaayam kii
 After Sonia, Rahul Gandhi was certain to be the president, but after Rahul Gandhi's resignation, the Congress could not find any new face
 kareeb maheene bhar tak party bagaiyr adhyaksh ke chalati rahi or aakhirkaar phir se sonia gandhi ko hi congress kaa antarim adhyaksh niyukt kar diya gaya
 The reason behind this was that the Congress party revolved around the axis of the Gandhi family and if there was a president outside the family, there would be a danger of breakdown in the Congress
 rahul gandhi kii ab phir se congress kii kaman sanbhaalane ko kab taiyaar honge is par kuch bhi saaf nahin he
 After Sonia Gandhi, someone outside the Gandhi family will take charge of the party, there is little hope
 aise main party ke saamne chunauti gambhir he kyonki sonia gandhi pehle hi swasthya kaarnon se jujh rahi hai saath hi unki badhati umr bhi sakriyata ke aade aa sakati he
 The party may disintegrate if a new alternative to the post of president is not discovered after him
 rajyon main kaise milegi jitsal 2014 main mili sharmnaak haar ke baad congress ne 3 rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main jeet darj kar janata main bharosa badhaati najar ai lekin ek saal baad phir 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress kaa vahi hashr hua
 In the year 2018, the Congress snatched the BJP from states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh but with the defeat in 2019, Karnataka got out of its hands
 congress ke vidhayakon kii baghawat se dakshin ke is rajya main phir se camel khil gaya he
 Assembly elections are due in states like Delhi, Haryana and Maharashtra in the coming year
 teenon hi rajyon main party netritv ke gambhir sankat se jujh rahi he
 The face of the party is yet to be decided to compete with the current Khattar government in Haryana
 purv mukhyamantri bhupendra hooda congress alaakaman ke saamne khud ke mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar ghoshit karaane main juty he or iske liye unhone taal bhi thonk di he
 On the other hand, after the death of former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit in Delhi, the Congress has become completely devoid of leadership
 yahaan bhi uske paas bade bahumat vaali aam aadmi party or 7 saansadon vaale bijepi se paar paanaa hoga
 In Maharashtra, the congress-ncp has lagged behind the BJP and Shiv Sena alliance
 maharashtra main bijepi ke yuva mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke saamne congress kiske chehre par daanv lagaaegi yah kah paanaa kaaphi mushkil he
 Seats increased, along with the challenge
 
 
 is loksabhaa chunaav main party ke saansadon kii sankhya 44 se badhkar 52 jarur hui par congress ke diggaj netaaon ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Even the then party president Rahul Gandhi lost his traditional seat in Amethi
 loksabhaa main congress dal ke netaa mallikarjun khadge se lekar upie sarkaar main mantri rahe diggaj congressiyon ko bijepi kii aandhi main tinkaa bhi naseeb nahin hua
 With 303 mps in the Lok Sabha, the BJP came back stronger and came back to power for the second time in a row where the NDA currently has around 7 times more mps than the Congress
 vahiin rajyasabha main agle saal tak bijepi bahumat hasil kar legi or ucch sadan main congress sikudti chali jaaegi
 On the one hand, the Modi government is taking tough and big decisions in its second term on the strength of the overwhelming majority, on the other hand the Congress failed to bring together the opposition camp as well
 rajyasabha main jammu kashmir punargathan bill or teen talaak vidheyak par voting ke dauraan congress gaiyr endie vaale dalon ko bhi sarkaar ke khilaaf nahin khadaa kar saki
 As a result, the Modi government has demonstrated its determination by taking the historic decision to remove Article 370 from Jammu Kashmir in addition to the much-awaited triple talaq bill
 aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ise bhunaane kii puri koshish karegi jo congress ke liye badi chunauti khadi kar sakate hai
 When the Congress came out as a ruckus inside, the party may look united at the moment but it is clear from the statements of the leaders that many big leaders of the party do not agree with every line of the party
 masalan kashmir se dhara 370 hataane par congress main 2 faad khuleam dekhne ko mila
 From Rahul Gandhi's close Jyotiraditya Scindia to former organization general secretary Janardan Dwivedi and young Congressman Dipendra Hooda, he supported the Modi government's decision, while the Congress has been vocal against this decision
 yahi nahin isi faisle ke khilaaf jaakar rajyasabha main party ke chif vip bhubaneshwar kalita ne to congress se apana istipha tak de diya
 From the beginning of the second term, the Modi government has put one goal after the other and put it on the backfoot of the Congress
 congress loksabhaa chunaav kii haar se ubar paati usase pehle hi party kai nai chunautiyon se jujh rahi he
 It will become more difficult in the coming times, because the BJP, which won by an overwhelming majority, is going to outweigh the Congress due to its tough decisions

 These prospects were strengthened after Pune started the chase in Mumbai's goal

 indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad 1984 main hua tha sikh dangasikh dange ke daag ko aaj tak nahin chhudaa pai congress partypurv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne 1984 ke sikh dangon ko lekar aisa bayaan diya he, jise lekar kai sawaal khadey hone lage hai
 Manmohan Singh said on Wednesday that the then Sikh riots in 1984 could have been averted if the then Home Minister PV Narasimha Rao had accepted Inder Kumar Gujral's advice in time
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki sikh dange kaa daag jo congress ke daaman par laga he, kya ab use party narsimha raav ke maththe par madhnaa chaahati he
 Speaking at the 100th birth anniversary celebrations of former Prime Minister Indra Kumar Gujral, Manmohan Singh said that Gujral had advised to deploy the army to stop the 1984 Sikh riots, but the then Home Minister Narasimha Rao ignored his advice
 Had given
 gujral ne sikh danga bhadakne kii raat ko grahamantri narsimha raav se mulaakaat bhi kii thi
 Manmohan Singh said, 'indra Kumar Gujral was very concerned about the atmosphere before the Sikh riots and went to the then Home Minister Narasimha Rao at night
 gujral ne narsimha raav ko salaah di thi ki halaat behad gambhir hai
 Therefore, the government should call and deploy the army as soon as possible
 agar gujral kii salaah ko narsimha raav ne maan liya hota, to 1984 kaa sikh narsanhaar tal saktaa tha
 After the assassination of Indira Gandhi, the Sikh riots actually took place in Punjab when the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi launched Operation Bluestar for the elimination of terrorism
 isi ke chalate unke naaraaz sikh surakshakarmiyon ne 31 oktober 1984 ko indira gandhi kii hatya kar di thi or iske agle roj se hi dilli or desh ke duusare kuch hisson main sikh virdohi dange bhadak uthe the
 After the Sikh riots, on November 19, 1984, Indira Gandhi's successor, her son Rajiv Gandhi, said in front of the gathering of the people gathered in the boat club, 'we know how much anger the people have, but when a big tree falls The surrounding earth vibrates
 'congress ke daaman par 84 dange kaa daagis bayaan ke baad sikh samudaay main rajeev gandhi ke prati kaaphi naaraazgi badi
 It was believed that Rajiv was sympathetic to the rioters and did not take the slaughter of the Sikh community as seriously as it should have been
 rajeev gandhi ke vaktavy sikh danga peediton ko jakhm par namak chhidakane jaisaa laga tha
 Many opposition parties like the BJP and the Akali Dal often quote this statement of Rajiv Gandhi and use it as a weapon against the Congress
 1984 kaa sikh danga congress ke gale kii haddi ban chukaa he
 Sonia Gandhi to Rahul Gandhi have apologized to the Sikh community for the 1984 riots
 iske baavjood dange kaa bhoot congress kaa peechha nahin chhod rahaa he
 In such a situation, is Manmohan Singh's statement on the Sikh riots on the occasion of Gujral's birth anniversary, not part of the strategy to put this stain on Narasimha Rao's head? supreme court ne ram janmabhumi vivaad maamle main land equijishan act kii vaidhata par daakhil yachika ko mukhya maamle ke saath tag kar diya he
 While giving the verdict on the matter, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that whatever he has to say, he should say before the Constitution Bench
 hindu mahasabha kamalesh kumaar tiwari ke saath-saath kai ram bhakton ne land equijishan act kii vaidhata par sawaal uthaaya tha
 This petition states that in 1993 67
 7 acre jameen adhigrahit karne kaa adhikaar centre ke paas kabhi tha hi nahin kyonki bhoomi rajya kaa vishay he
 Therefore, the central government cannot acquire state land for its scheme
 1993 main kiya gaya bhoomi adhigrahan avaidh tha
 Earlier, the Narendra Modi government of the Center in its petition on the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid case running in the Supreme Court said that the non-disputed site in Ayodhya should be returned to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas
 jis bhoomi par ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid ko lekar vivaad he vah supreme court apane paas rakhe
 The Modi government, in its petition filed before the Supreme Court, said that the share given to Hindu parties in Ayodhya should be handed over to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas
 jabaki 2
 Some portion of the 77 acres of land should be returned to the Government of India
 ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid jameen vivaad ke paas kareeb 70 acre jameen centre sarkaar ke paas he
 2 of it
 77 acre kii jameen par elahabaad hai court ne faisla sunaaya tha
 But the land that is in dispute is land 0
 313 acre hi he
 The Supreme Court imposed a stay on this land in 1993 and prohibited any kind of activity here

 lagaataar teen din tak china kii rajdhani 2010 ke patjhad main dhuen ke ek vishaal parking lot main tabdeel ho gai thi
 During that time a routine road maintenance work caused the world's longest traffic jam
 yah 100 kilometre lanbaa jam tha jo beijing se lekar hebei ke praant tak khinchataa chalaa gaya tha jisamen do kilometre kaa safar tay karne main kaaron ko puure din kaa vakt lag rahaa tha
 This jam took a total of 10 days to open
 sankat abhi tala nahin tha
 Was jammed thik teen din baad baari barish hui jisane dhuen or dhul ko to saaf kar diya lekin beijing ke yatayaat ko dobaaraa tehra diya
 For more than half a day, 4,321 roads were jammed
 in do ghatnaon ne yatayaat or paryaavaran niojakon ko shahar kii yatayaat niti kii samiksha karne ko baadhya kiya jo 2008 ke olympic khelon ke baad se badali nahin gai thi
 During the Olympics, Beijing introduced a system of equal and odd vehicles for some time to reduce pollution, after which the existing system is implemented in which the people of the city are forbidden to take out a car in a hurry
 beijing kii yatayaat niti par shodh kar chukin renmin university kii ek professor ping queen kahati hai ki shuruyaat main to ye upaay kaaphi aakarshak jaan pade the kyonki pehle saal main pradooshan kaa str kam hua or jam main bhi raahat mili thi
 2000 cameras were installed in the city to monitor the license plate
 adhiktar vyavastha swachaalit thi kyonki sarkaar ko lagata tha ki agar yatayaat police ke haath main yah kaam choda gaya to bhrashtachar kii gunjaaish rahegi or yatayaat baadhit hoga
 100 RMB i
e
 1000 Rs on the violating vehicle
 kaa jurmaana kiya jaataa or chaalak ke online khate se yah paisa kaat liya jaataa tha
 The license was withdrawn upon non-payment
 ping kahati hai ki teen saal ke bheetar yatayaat kaa str pehle jaisaa ho gaya
 She says, "just like what happened in Mexico City
 ” ve bataati hai, “unhone kaaron par jab bandish lagaani shuru kii, to uske das saal baad shahar or zyada pradooshit tathaa bheed bharaa ho gaya kyonki log duusari gadibhan kharid rahe the
 Similar evidence was found in Beijing that the market for old cars had suddenly swung
 ”sarkaar ne iske baad sam-visham vaali vyavastha ko or simit karne ke khilaaf faisla liya
 Experts say that there were three reasons behind this move
 pehla yah ki yojanakaaron ko laga ki is kadam ke chalate china ke madhyavarg or sankatagrast musafiron kaa aakrosh bhadak saktaa he (baavjood iske ki beijing main duniya kaa sabase lanbaa subway system he jo 600 kilometre lanbaa he)- china kii communist party ke yojanakaaron ke liye yah sambhaavna thik nahin hoti jo vaise bhi asantosh ke prati satark rahete hai
 Secondly, it would have increased the purchase of older cars
 isliye sarkaar ek or samaadhaan lekar iru usne har maheene gadipoon ke panjikaran kii sankhya ko simit kar diya
 Shanghai was the first Chinese city to introduce a monthly auction system on the lines of Singapore
 ye upaay kaaphi kargar rahe hai jiske chalate jam kam hua he or sthaneey sarkaron ko paise kii baari aamad hui he kyonki panjikaran kii laagat ab ek lakh aarambi yani 10 lakh ru
 Has reached beijing ne is maamle main zyada lacheela rukh dikhaaya&usne lottery se har maheene 17,600 panjikaran jari karne kaa faisla liya
 Ping says, "the jam has reduced and the growth of vehicles has also slowed down
 ”teesraa kaaran pradooshan ke sroton par kiya gaya vah adhyayan tha jo sarkaar ne karavaaya tha, jisamen paaya gaya ki kul utsarjanon main vaahanon kii hissedari sirf ek-tihaai he
 The study revealed that because of this, the benefits from even-odd compulsions would be extremely modest to disturb the entire driver population
 adhiktar kaaron se hone vaala pradooshan 31
 1 per cent while coal for the rest of emissions (22
 4 fisadi), anya audyogic utsarjan (18
 1 per cent) and dust (14
 3 fisadi) jimmedaar tha
 There is no question of pollution from two-wheelers in Beijing as only battery-powered electric bikes are allowed in the city
 greenpis ke liye beijing main jalwaayu or urja prachaar abhiyaan chalaane vaale dong liyansai bataate hai ki isi kaaran se sarkaar kaa sara dhyaan sadak yatayaat kii bajaae koyale se chalane vaale udyogon ko simit karne or utsarjan ke maanakon main sudhaar laane par zyada he
 He explained, "the government issued several emission standards, enacted an environmental and air pollution law (which provides for penalties for violators) and closed three out of four coal-fired plants within Beijing
 ” aakhri sanyantr 2016 ke aarambh main band kiya janaa he
 Dong's research suggests that PM2 in the first nine months of the year
 5 kaa str pichley saal ke mukaable 12 fisadi neeche gir gaya
 It is a different thing that in the first two weeks of December, the picture of Beijing was reversed when once again the entire city was clouded by mist
 sarkaar ne 7 disambar ko pehali baar dhuen ke liye “red alert” jari kiya
 It was the highest in the four-category warning system under which schools are closed, all construction is halted and a system with even-odd numberplates is temporarily introduced
 teen dinon ke liye jari is red alert ke peeche agle teen dinon kaa vah purvanumaan tha jisamen piem 2
 Level 5 was said to be over 200
 is chetavanee kaa swasthya jaankaron or harith samoohon ne swaagat kiya
 Bernard Schwartlander, a representative of the World Health Organization in China, said, "first, it conveys the severity of pollution levels in people; Secondly, it encourages some steps by the government to reduce pollution levels immediately - such as the closure and construction restrictions of construction sites and factories, etc
 ”dong bataate hai ki vaayu pradooshan main aayaa yah oochaal urja kii badi hui maang or koyala jalaakar paidaa kii gai urja se aayaa tha jisase kadaake kii asaamaanya thand main beijing ke central heating system ko chaalu rakhaa janaa tha
 He says, "despite this warning, there is no doubt that air quality has improved in the long term
 ” dhuen ke khilaaf beijing kii jang abhi khatm nahin hui he, lekin itnaa tay he ki uski jang sahi disha main ja rahi he

 google play or mailaware kaa rishta purana he
 Google tries its best to remove them, but from time to time apps with adware and malware are found on the Play Store
 google ne haal hi main play store se kai eps hataae hai
 Once again, reports are coming that Google has removed some 210 apps from the Play Store
 security form check point ke researchrs ne pataa lagaaya tha ki ye eps darasal aidware se prabhavit the
 Adware are software that automatically displays advertisements to you via pop and does not require any permission for this
 ye darasal computers ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he, lekin ab smartphone main bhi aise eps milte hai
 According to the report, these Android adware have been found in 150 million devices worldwide
 is kathith Simbad mailaware ko kuch mobile gaming ke liye banaaya gaya tha jinamein Real Tractor Farming Simulator, Heavy Mountain Bus Simulator 2018 or Snow Heavy Excavator Simulator shaamil hai
 Each of these apps has been downloaded more than five million times
 jabaki inamen se ek 10 million se bhi zyada baar downlod kiya gaya he
 By doing this, Tot 210 apps were found, which Google has now removed from the Play Store
 researchrs kaa kahana he ki simbad main ye kabaliyat he ki ye teen grups – sho aids, fishing or expoger tu adar aplication main divide ho saktaa he
 Through this, attackers who create simbad malware can create phishing pages for multiple platforms and open them in the browser
 kul mila kar ye he ki iske jariye yugers sidhe taur par fishing kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 Your username and password can be easily stolen by phishing
 ek sawaal ye bhi uthta he ki baar baar google play store ke saath hi aisa kyon hota he
 The company reviews it before the app is uploaded to the Google Play store and there are also processes for it
 lekin mana ye jaataa he ye google kaa rivyuu process abhi bhi aipal ke rivyuu process se kamjor he
 So Apple App Store does not always face such problems
 agar aapke smartphone main bhi is tarah ke eps hai to bina der kiye inhen hataa den or kisi bhi ap ko install karne se pehle uske publisher kii jaanch kar len or ye sunishchit kar len ki wo credibal ap he yaa nahin

 sahvaag ne gujarat ke khilaaf do pariyon main 1 or 15, mumbai ke khilaaf 9 or naabad 35, haryana ke khilaaf 3 or 6, odisha ke khilaaf 0 or 44, punjab ke khilaaf 10 or 12 tathaa karnataka ke khilaaf 32 or 11 ranon kii paariyaan khelin
 Sehwag was dropped from the team due to poor form
 unka sthaan test team main shikhar dhawan ne liya tha or mohali main march 2013 main shandaar saikadaa lagaaya tha
 Sehwag has not been able to score a single century in the last 10 Test innings while in his last one dozen ODI innings, only one half-century has been scored off his bat
 sahvaag jaisaa mahaan khilaadi, jinke naam test maichon main do tihare shatak or ekadivasiy maichon kii sarvocch vyaktigat pari (219) darj he, agar cricket se sanyas letaa he to shandaar vidaai kaa hakdaar he
 However, due to poor form, the path of Sehwag's return is gradually getting difficult and at the same time the prospect of his respectful farewell is getting diluted
 sahvaag ne test maichon main sabase tej tihara shatak or sabase tej doharaa shatak lagaaya he
 At least on footwork he specializes in playing the most accurate square drive
 unki ankhon or haathon ke bich behtareen talmail he or isi kaaran vah acchhee gendon ko bhi simarekha ke baahar pahunchane kaa madda rakhte hai
 In today's date, this amazing quality of Sehwag is not supporting him and that is why he continues to fail match by match
 bharat ko england ke khilaaf cricket ke makka par 28 saal baad jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaakar main of da match banane vaale tej gendbaaj ishanth sharma ne kaha ki ye wicket unke liye nahin, sirf captain mahendra singh dhoni ke liye the
 India registered a 95-run win over the Lords in the second cricket test today
 ishanth ko pehali pari main acchhee gendbaaji ke baavjood koi wicket nahin mila tha, lekin unhone duusari pari main saat wicket jhatakkar paanch maichon kii shrinkhalaa main 1

 ishanth ne duusari pari main 23 over main 74 ran dekar saat wicket jatke
 Five of the six wickets that fell today were named after this tall bowler
 is shandaar pradarshan se ishanth kaa naam bhi ab lords ke 'onors board’ par likhaa jayega
 The Delhi fast bowler said, 'the way batsmen played in the first innings, Ajinkya Rahane showed a good game in the first innings, which gave us a rhythm
 vijay, jadeja or bhuvi bhi jis tarah khele, acha tha
 Ishant said, 'the way MS (mahendra Singh Dhoni) brother handles the team, the way he keeps motivating the players
 mujhe lagata he ki ye saare wicket mere liye nahin the, ye sirf captain ke liye the
 Ms Bhai told me that you are so tall, you should try a bouncer

 However, before the voting, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and then Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav became friends, so the Congress workers had to get the slogan written on the walls of UP
 baavjood iske akhilesh kii satta or rahul kii saakh donon hi hawa ho gai
 Now the number is from Gujarat, where assembly elections are to be held by the end of this year
 congress gujarat kii satta se 22 saal pehle bedakhal hui or ab tak bijepi ne use vaapasi kaa koi mauka nahin diya
 However, from October 1996 to March 1998, the Congress was part of the Rashtriya Janata Party government
 magar party kii apni sarkaar nahin ban pai
 In the 1995 assembly elections, BJP candidates won 121 out of a total of 182 seats
 iske saath hi bijepi ne pehali baar gujarat main sarkaar banaai aurakeshubhai patel mukhyamantribane
 Not only did the Congress have to look out of power, but it was reduced to just 45 seats
 is chunaav ke baad bijepi ne congress kii qamar tod di
 Election-by-election Congress's position deteriorated
 1998 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ek baar phir bijepi ne 117 siton ke saath apana paracham laharaaya or congress 53 siton tak hi pahunch pai
 In the same tenure of the government, Narendra Modi came in command of the state
 mukhyamantri keshubhai patel par bukamp se nipatane main fail hone ke sawaal uthe, jiske baad 2001 main hi kharaab swasthya ke daawey ke saath unki kursi par modi ko virajman kiya gaya
 The BJP contested the 2002 election under the leadership of Narendra Modi and won once again
 is tarah bijepi kii jeet kaa silsilaa 2007 se hote hue 2012 tak chalata rahaa
 The BJP won 119 seats in the 2012 election and did not let the Congress once again touch sixty
 haalanki, ab modi centre kii satta main hai
 His Chanakya Amit Shah has also reached Delhi now
 patidaaron kaa samarthanabhi ab bijepi se chhitakta najar aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Congress is in a mood to put forth its 22-year-old political ground
 magar vikaas kaa model kahe jane vaale gujarat main kya congress upi kii tarah '22 saal gujarat behaal' kii tarj par chunavi maidan main utar paaegi yaa phir wo notebandi-jiesti or sampradayikta jaise muddon or patidaaron ke gusse ke aadhaar par hi bijepi kaa muqabla karne utregi, ye bada sawaal he?

 The latest pictures obtained suggest that China will complete its first indigenously built aircraft carrier (aircraft carrier) very soon

 " Pictures of the new version of the J-15 fighter aircraft, dubbed the J-15A, have surfaced significantly on Chinese social media

 The catapult launch system, which attaches to the nose-wheel of the combat aircraft onboard, uses a steam-powered piston or electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS), which allows the fighter aircraft to propel itself from the small deck of the vessel
 The tax is blown away

 In the absence of the extra speed gained from the catapult launch system, China's existing J-15 fighters have to be kept lighter to fly, which means they have to fly with fewer weapons or less fuel, allowing them to fly Operational deployments are left 'less efficient'

 The time we are living in can certainly not be called very good

 There is a silence before our eyes, there is a silence, but in this silence there is also a noise, anguish, scream, which is a sign of injustice, exploitation suppression and excesses of excesses

 One such silent spark ignites the recent book 'khamoshi' by famous scientist and filmmaker Gauhar Raza
 raza ek vaigyanik hone ke saath hi ek samvedansheel insaan bhi hai or unki yah samvedansheeltaa nikal kar ai he unke nazmon ke madhyam se
 This is Raza's second collection as a poet, but he is also a great thinker and a magician of words
 unke paas jindagi kaa anubhav he or beshak kaam kaa bhi or unhone apane donon anubhavon ko milakar nazmon kii jo chaashni taiyaar kii he wo bilkul parfect he
 Raza Saheb has literally depicted the hate, violence, ruthless killing of innocents and vandalism spread all over the world in his book
 unki gajalon or kavitaaon main anyaay se upja dukh he, aakrosh he or is anyaay se ladane kaa jazbaa bhi he magar badi sanjidagi, khamoshi or tabiyat se unhone kalam kaa hathiyaar chalaaya he
 These whose bloodshed is filled with bloodshed and discrimination in the name of religion, society and profession, and their agony is visible in most poems and views
 raza ji insaaniyat ke pairokaar hai or usee kii jai puri duniya main chaahate hai
 Raza is neither more violent nor too weak to tell his anger and agony, he has found a middle way which is far more effective
 sankalan main shaamil gazalon kii bhashaa bilkul sahaj, saral or aasaani se pathak ke dil tak pahunchane vaali he
 In the absence of complications, the eye communicates even more effectively
 mohabbat, aman, dosti, bhaicharahe hamane nibhaayaa, nibhaa kar to dekhotumhaara he kooda hamaare saron parakabhi apane sar par uthaa kar to dekhosankalan main chhandmukt kavitaayen bhi shaamil kii gai hai
 Big lines are just a word on the page, there is only one word somewhere, but these words also explain the whole line and small lines look like drops of dew that hang in a rope drying clothes
 Has happened

 Gauhar Raza has 71 nazams in the 'khamoshi' poetry collection which is spread over 174 pages

 hai court me unke vakil ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki sibiai ne koi saboot na hone kaa tark dekar khud is maamle ko band kar diya tha
 But the case was registered as soon as the government changed
 is maamle main kaaman coj sanstha kii or se daayar yachika ke baad sibiai ne shuruaati jaanch ke liye maamla darj kiya tha
 The CBI itself told the court that there is no evidence that a case is made against them
 iske baad centre main sarkaar badalane ke baad sibiai ne dobaaraa maamla darj karke jaanch shuru kii
 It is clear that this case has been registered after being inspired by politics
 pratibha singh ke vakil ne kaha ki unke khilaaf bhrashtachar kaa koi bhi maamla nahin banataa or sibiai kii karrwai gaiyrkanoonee he
 In such a case, the case filed should be dismissed
 sibiai ne jab unki muvakkila ke nivas kaa chapa maaraa to bhi koi bhi aapattijanak dastavej or sakshya baraamad nahin kiya, is maamle main jirah aage bhi jari rahegi
 Significantly, the Himachal Pradesh High Court in its interim order on October 1, 2015, on the petition of Virbhadra Singh, prohibited the filing of charge sheet against Singh in this case without his arrest, interrogation or permission of the court
 sibiai ne is faisle ko sarvocch nyaayalay main chunauti di or court ne is maamle ko dilli hoicourt main transfar kiya tha, lekin supreme court ne court kaa antarim aadesh barkaraar rakhaa tha

 ) a hearing was held on Monday in the Supreme Court over the suspicious death of CBI Judge BH Loya
 is cese kii sunwaayee chif justise deepak mishra kii aguwai vaali bench kar rahi he
 During the hearing on Monday, the Supreme Court has ordered that no High Court will now hear the case related to Judge Loya
 bombai hoicourt main jo do yachikaayen pending hai, unhen bhi supreme court transfar kiya jaae
 The court has asked both the parties to seal their documents and submit them to the court
 maamle kii agali sunwaayee 2 farvari, dopaher do baje hogi
 Senior advocate Harish Salve, on behalf of the Maharashtra government, gave full details of the incident
 vahiin yachikakarta kii ore se dushyant dave ne salve kaa virodh kiya
 He said that Salve had appeared in defense of Amit Shah, now he is from the Maharashtra government
 isse santhaan kii chhavi dhoomil ho rahi he, court ko ise rokna chahie
 Many newspapers have raised questions on the death: During the SC hearing on Monday, the Supreme Court has ordered that no high court will now hear the case related to Judge Loya
 bombai hoicourt main jo do yachikaayen pending hai, unhen bhi supreme court transfar kiya jaae
 The Supreme Court has taken cognizance that many newspapers and media groups have questioned the death of Judge Loya
 court ne kaha he ki maamle kii sunwaayee niyamanusaar hogi, sabhi vakeelon ko court ke saath coperate karnaa chahie
 Who said what in the hearing? Justice Chandrachud - Looking at the report till date, it is a natural death
 harish salve -jab papers ke anusaar ye ek prakritik maut he, to phir amit shah kaa naam isamen kyon aa rahaa he
 We do not require any certificate from the petitioner
 dushyant dave -is maamle par sarkaar kaa jo rukh rahaa he, vah sahi nahin he
 It may be a natural death, but there is scope for doubt given the situation
 lihaaja jaanch lajimi he
 Apart from Chief Justice Deepak Mishra, the bench will have Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice DY Chandrachud
 beete shanivaar ko hi is bench ne is cese ko apane haath main liya he
 Explain that there was opposition to giving the hearing of Judge Loya case to Justice Bench of Justice Arun Mishra
 jiske baad unhone khud hi is maamle se peeche kar liya tha
 Four judges had held a press conference and it is worth mentioning that recently four Supreme Court justices held a press conference for the first time revolting against Chief Justice Deepak Mishra
 is dauraan in nyaayamurtiyon ne khule taur par jaj loya ke cese kii sunwaayee ko lekar aapatti uthaai thi
 These judges also complain that the Chief Justice listens to all the important cases themselves, that is, they take advantage of being the Master of Roster
 kya he puraa maamla?bataa den ki justise loya bahucharchit soharabuddin shaikh maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the
 In 2005, Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar were abducted by the Gujarat Police and were killed in an alleged encounter in Hyderabad
 soharabuddin muthbhed ke gavaah tulsiram kii bhi maut ho gai thi
 BJP president Amit Shah was also named in this case
 maamle se jude trial ko supreme court ne maharashtra main transfar kiya tha
 The judge was hearing the case earlier, but expressed displeasure at BJP president Amit Shah not appearing in the case
 jiske baad unka tabadalaa ho gaya tha
 After this, Justice Loya had heard the case
 disambar, 2014 main justise loya kii nagpur main maut ho gai thi
 Which was considered suspicious
 justise loya kii maut ke baad jin jaj ne is maamle kii sunwaayee kii, unhone amit shah ko maamle main bari kar diya tha
 Recently, a magazine claimed in its report that Justice Loya's death was not simple but suspicious
 jiske baad se hi yah maamla dobaaraa charchaa main aayaa
 Political rhetoric has also continued on this issue
 haalanki, jaj loya ke bete anuj loya ne kuch din pehle hi press conference kar is mudde ko bada karne par naaraazgi jataai thi
 Anuj had said that his father's death was natural, he does not want to let the issue escalate

 The next hearing of the case will be on 16 May

 He died at Rammanohar Lohia Hospital on Friday night at 11

 ilaaj ke dauraan unhen dil kaa daura bhi padaa
 On Thursday evening, he attempted self-immolation by pouring kerosene oil outside gate number four of Parliament, near Vijay Chowk
 police ke varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki mohanan ne ilaaj kar rahe chikitsakon ko bataaya ki sarkaar jis tarah se mumbai hamale ke peediton se vyavhaar kar rahi he, vah usase bahut dukhi the
 He was deeply troubled by the death of Major Unnikrishnan
 mohanan ne apane parivaar ko bataaya tha ki vah ernakulam ja rahe hai, lekin iske bajaay vah rajdhani dilli aa gaye
 Major Unnikrishnan's father k Unnikrishnan said, "we are satisfied with the attitude of the government and we have no problem

 We thought he had recovered from the shock of his death, but he took this step
 march kii 2 taarikh ko yuvajan shramik raithu congress (viesarsi) pramukh jagan mohan reddy hyderabad main tridandi chinna jiyaar swami se mili
 Apparently, he took blessings for his party's electoral success in the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections to be held in Andhra Pradesh
 dilachasp baat yah he ki swami se jagan kii mulaakaat ke peeche telugana ke mukhyamantri or telugana raashtra samiti (tiares) pramukh ke
 Chandrasekhar Rao was playing the role
 lekin, telugana ke alag rajya banane kaa virodh karne vaale jagan or andhra pradesh main rajya ke bantwaare ke liye jimmedaar maane jane vaale chandrashekhar raav ke bich najdiki sapaat raajnneeti main feet nahin dikh rahi
 Especially, when there is less than a month left for the election of Lok Sabha and Assembly in Andhra Pradesh and Lok Sabha in Telangana
 darasal, donon netaaon ke bich ubhar rahe siyaasi sameekaran kii door hyderabad se 1,500 kilometre dur sthit dilli se judi he, jahaan pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv vaale rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) ko rokane ke liye puraa vipaksh or ek-duusare ke kattar dushman rahe dal bhi modi ke khilaaf ekajute ho gaye hai
 In such a situation, BJP has realized the need of reliable future allies (the party supporting post-election) due to the continuously decreasing number of NDA allies and the assertiveness of the remaining allies
 isi jarurat ke lihaaj se kesiar or jagan ko rajg khemaa ek-saath laane or saadhane kii koshish main he
 In fact, since the formation of the NDA government under Modi's leadership at the Center in 2014, 14 parties of this alliance have left the BJP
 vaise, janata dal (united) ke rup main bihar main bhaajapa ko ek majboot sahyogi jarur mila, lekin telegu desham party (tidipi) ke rup main rajg kunbe se ek bada ghatak (16 saansad) baahar chalaa gaya
 Among the current NDA allies are Shiv Sena, JD (U), Shiromani Akali Dal and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kadagam (AIADMK), but their confidence crisis with BJP is not completely over
 bhaajapa sutron kaa kahana he ki maharashtra main shivasena ke saath bhaajapa kaa pehle jaisaa vishwaas ab nahin rahaa
 The relationship between the two parties had deteriorated to such an extent that Shiv Sena had even passed a resolution in the party's executive committee last year to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections on its own
 haalanki bhaajapa kisi tarah se shivasena ke saath gathbandhan bachaane main safal rahi lekin donon dalon ke kaaryakartaaon ke bich vaimnasy charam par pahunch chukaa he
 Despite the alliance between the two parties, the situation is that Maharashtra in-charge of BJP and general secretary Saroj Pandey is prevented from visiting party worker, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's house
 maharashtra bhaajapa ke ek netaa bataate hai, ''thakare sirf modi or amit shah ko barabari kaa darja dekar baat karte hai
 If other BJP leaders go to their house and meet them, they are given a small chair to sit on
 yah dekhakar bhaajapa kaaryakarta khud ko apamaanit mahasoos karte hai
 The two parties have come together only for this reason that they do not suffer loss in the elections
 donon dalon main bharose kii kami saaf dekhi ja sakati he
 "there is a similar situation in Bihar
 yahaan rajg ke paale main abhi jad (you) or lok janashakti party (lojpa) shaamil hai lekin lojpa ko saadhane ke liye bhaajapa ko kadi mashkkat kerani padi
 However, Union Minister of State Giriraj Singh says, "the BJP is in a strong position, so all parties in the NDA will benefit from Narendra Modi's leadership
" '' lekin ve yah jodpha nahin bhoolatey, ''agar bhaajapa damdaar nahin hoti yaa narendra modi kaa netritv nahin hota to yah kahana mushkil he ki koun saathi kab saath rahe or kab chhod de
 "giriraj's view is considered practical by a senior leader of the Bihar BJP
 unka kahana he, ''vaicharik rup se bhaajapa se bhinn mat rakhane vaale dal tabhi tak bhaajapa ke saath hai jab tak unhen chunavi jeet ke liye bhaajapa kii jarurat mahasoos hoti he
 Which party will go after the election, it is difficult to say
 '' bihar se taalluk rakhane vaale ek kendriya rajyamantri kehete hai, ''2014 main upendra kushvaha hamaare saath the
 This time he left with RJD because he sees more benefit there
 yah kahana mushkil he ki kal koi or dal saath chhod de yaa saath aa jaae
 "BJP leaders are also assuming that conflicting voices will be heard in coalition parties until the seats are aligned
" bihar or maharashtra main kis seat par koun ladega, rajg main yah abhi tak tay nahin ho sakaa he
 The election date has been announced, so the pressure from the allies on the bjp's seat alignment is increasing
 bhaajapa netritv yah maanakar chal rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke baad rajg ek nae rup main saamne aayega
 Apparently, the party is also not denying that some existing allies may go out and some new allies are coming with the party
 aise halaat main bhaajapa ko rajg kaa kunba badhaane kii jarurat mahasoos ho rahi he
 However BJP national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP G
 ve
 L
 narsimha raav kehete hai, ''2019 main bhaajapa apane dam par 300 se zyada seat jeetegi, isliye rajg main or dalon kii jarurat nahin he
 We will go to the elections with those who are with us
 '' unke is daawey ke baad bhi party ke varisht netaa yah sweekaar karte hai ki nae saathiyon ke liye bhaajapa kaa darwaja khulaa hua he
 Obviously, due to political needs, many parties do not join the pre-election alliance, but such parties will not come together after the election, it is not necessary
 vitt mantri arun jetali kehete hai, ''sahyogi dalon kaa matlab hameshaa sarkaar yaa gathbandhan main shaamil dal hi nahin hote
 The government also receives issue-based support from parties that are not part of any coalition, either in Parliament or outside Parliament
 kai baar to virdohi gathbandhan main shaamil dalon main se bhi kuch dal sarkaar ko mudda aadhaarit samarthan dete rahe hai
 "realizing this political need, BJP is also working on Plan b for alliance
" plan bi ke tahat party un dalon ko saadhane main lagi he, jo 2019 ke chunaav ke baad bhaajapa ke liye mufeed sabit ho sakate hai
 However, the party is making a ruckus in this matter
 party ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''agar kisi vajah se bhaajapa ke maujuuda saathi dalon kaa pradarshan chunaav main behatar nahin rahaa to phir hamaare paas aage kaa vikalp kya hoga?iske liye jaruri he ki aise dalon ke saath talmail jari rakhaa jaae yaa nae sire se talmail kiya jaae, jo philhal na to bhaajapa ke kheme main hai or na hi congress ke kheme main
 Since the parties involved in the non-bjp and non-congress alliance have cleared their political cards, it is now clear that TRS in Telangana, YSRC in Andhra and Biju Janata Dal in Odisha after NDA 2019 Lok Sabha elections New partners can be formed

 england ko chah ran die gaye
 Eventually the match was tied and went to the super over
 tivi riple se jaahir tha ki jab gaptil ne gend phenki thi, tab adil raashid or stokes ne doosraa ran nahin puraa kiya tha
 So, he should have been given five runs
