 " uttarakhand main badrinaath or kedarnath dham aajkal alag-alag kaarnon se khurkhiyon main hai
 The temple committee is now seeking consultation with the state government due to the question being raised on the industrialists Gupta brothers who offered the roof of the sanctum sanctorum of Badrinath Dham with gold
 rajya sarkaar yah kahkar pallaa jhaad rahi he ki mandir samiti khud faisla lene main sakasham he ki kiskaa daan le, kiskaa nahin
 Gupta brothers tri-ajay, Rajesh and Atul Gupta, who are close to South African President Jacob Zuma, are facing an Enforcement Directorate inquiry into alleged corruption charges
 mul rup se uttar pradesh ke saharanpur ke rahane vaale gupta bandhuon ke kai thikaanon par iskar vibhaag ne bhi chaape maare hai
 So, Ganesh Godiyal, president of the badri-kedar temple committee, has written to the state government's Religion Culture Department, which constitutes the committee, has asked, "if the Gupta brothers come to the temple to donate as per their proposal, it should be accepted or No
 ’’ godiyal congress ke purv vidhayak hai
 According to Godiyal, the Gupta brothers came to see Badrinath last year
 ek katha ke dauraan unhone badrinaath mandiron ke garbhagrih kii chat par sone kaa pattar chadhaane kii peshkash rakhi thi
 The offer was unanimously accepted at the temple committee board meeting on November 27 last year
 adhyaksh ke anusaar, us samay gupta bandhuon par kisi aarope kii samiti ko koi soochna nahin thi
 But since May 15, the Gupta brothers have been trying to organize a story in Badrinath, which has been raising controversy
 duusari taraf kedarnath main kapaat khulne ke dauraan vahaan yojit lager sho par mandir samiti ke adhyaksh godiyal ne aapatti darj karai or use paramparaon kaa ulanghan bataaya
 The laser show titled 'adi Anant Shiva' certainly became the center of attraction for the devotees but the Congress said that the branding portion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be removed in it
 godiyal kaa daawa he ki trial ke dauraan unke virodh ke baad hi is sho se modi ke prachaar kaa vah hissaa hataaya gaya
 However Manish Sharma, chairman of the Akshar Group, which produced the show, categorically denies this
 rashtriya antyoday sangh ke sahyog se akshar group ne apni tarah kaa yah anokhaa lager sho taiyaar kiya he
 The show was trialled in Kedarnath on 28 April before the opening of the Kapat
 lekin godiyal ne aapatti jataai ki ise rajnatik prachaar kaa saadhan nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 His objection was on that 5-minute portion of the total 22-minute show praising Prime Minister Modi's efforts in temple construction
 baad main is hisse par roak laga di gai
 The show is being shown on the walls of the temple
 mandir samiti ke mukhya karyaadhikari bi
 D
 singh spasht karte hai ki lager sho kii anumati sarkaar ne di, mandir samiti ne nahin
 Godiyal argues that whether we are BJP or Congress, we will not allow the temple to become an arena of politics
 unhone lager sho dikhaane vaali company ko is hisse ko hataane ke liye kaha or kaha ki jab tak is hisse ko hataaya nahin jayega tab tak ve is lager sho ko dikhaane kii anumati nahin denge
 The chairman of the committee said, "this is the court of Kedar, no one has the right to show their advertisements, whether a prime minister or a president
 ’’ unhone kaha ki is mandir se karodon logon kii aasthaa judi hui he: ‘‘hamane aasthaa ke pratik kedarnath main is lager sho ko dikhaane vaali gujarat kii company se kaha ki mandir kii deevaaron par bhagwaan shiv se judi kisi bhi kahani ko dikhaaya ja saktaa he lekin agar ise party ke vigyaapan ke taur par istemaal kiya jayega to isko ham nahin chalane denge
 The state government is trying to keep itself separate from both the disputes
 bhaajapa bhi ise zyada tool dene se batch rahi he kyonki donon dhaamon se logon kii shradgha judi hui he

 If you think that your body has got nourishment just by having food, then tell you that it is not so
 khaanaa khaanaa poshan kaa ek step he
 The nutrition process is not complete until the food is digested properly and its nutrients are not absorbed in the body
 aise main khaanaa khaane ke baad koi bhi aisa kaam nahin karnaa chahie jisase poshan milane ke bajaay uskaa ulta asar pade
 Here we are telling you seven such things that it can prove dangerous to do after eating
 agar aap bhi kuch aisa karti hai to acchhee sehat ke liye ab inhen karnaa chhod den
 1
 na pien cigarettecigarette pinaa apane aap main ek buree lat he, jisase heart or saans sambandhi kai tarah kii bimaariyaan ghar kar jaati hai
 But according to experts, smoking immediately after eating can be ten times dangerous
 khaanaa khaane ke baad pi gai ek cigarette aamtaur par pi gai 10 cigarette ke baraabar nuksaan pahunchaati he
 Also, the risk of cancer also increases significantly
 2
 Do not eat immediately after eating
 If you eat fruit with food, then the fruits stick in the stomach and do not reach the intestine properly
 aise main unase milane vaala poshan adhuraa hi rah jaataa he
 On this basis, it is said that fruits should be consumed about an hour after eating or it can be eaten a few hours before eating
 subah khaali pet fal khaanaa sabase acha he
 3
 chaay se karen parhezchaay kii pattiyon main ucch amleeyta hoti he
 This affects the digestion of proteins and is not easily digested
 aise main koshish kerani chahie ki khaane ke ek se do ghante baad hi chaay pien
 4
 apni belt ko dhilaa na karenksar pasand kaa khaanaa dekh par ham apni belt ko dhilaa kar dete hai
 This clearly means that you are overeating
 overeating kisi bhi lihaaj se acchhee baat nahin he
 So try to eat as much as you are hungry or else it can also cause indigestion
 5
 Immediate bathing is a physical activity
 is dauraan haath or pair sakriy avasthaa main hote hai jisase in angon kaa blad flo kaaphi bad jaataa he
 Increased blood flow in these organs affects blood flow in the stomach and affects digestion
 6
 Do not go for a walk immediately
 a walk after eating is a good habit, but a quick walk after eating affects digestion
 tahalne main hamaare sharar kii energy bern hoti he jabaki sharir ke andar pachan kriya ke liye bhi urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In this case, taking a walk after some time can be a good action, but walking out with food can have the opposite effect
 turant soen nahinkhaane ko pachne main kuch vakt lagata he
 In such a situation, one should try not to sleep immediately after eating
 isse gas or aanton main sankraman hone kii ashanka bad jaati he

 lashkar-e-taiyaba paak adhikrut kashmir sthit prashikshan shiviron main 21 mahila aatankwaadiyon kaa ek samooh taiyaar kar rahaa he
 Army sources gave this information on Tuesday
 sena ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘hamaare paas pusht reportein hai ki lashkar-e-taiyaba paak adhikrut kashmir ke mujaffarabad main apane prashikshin shiviron main 21 mahila aatankwaadiyon ko prashikshit kar rahaa he taaki ve bharat main aatankwaadi ghatnaon ko anjaam de saken
 He said that the new faction has been named dukhbharati-e-taiba and Lashkar plans to activate the group in the Kashmir Valley

 He said that terrorist groups have suffered a major setback due to the killing of several top militants at the hands of security forces in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki unki yojana sthaneey yuvakon ko bhartee karne kii bhi he
 Jabra launched its new neckband-style headset in India in the month of June
 ye company ke puraane hedset model Jabra Elite 25e kii apgraded varjan he
 It has also been made a neckband design
 company ne is hedset kii keemat 7,499 rupee rakhi he
 We have used it for a long time and now we are passing it on to you
 yahaan ham aapako bataaenge kii kya yeblutoothhedset aapako khareednaa chahie
 Design and Build Quality: This headset is awesome in both the design and built areas
 yani jis tarah kaplasticus kiya gaya he or kaaphi premium he
 Also the wire that has been used is also very good
 shandaar kehane kaa matlab luk or confort donon se hi he
 It specifically uses memory wire, so that it retracts its shape despite folding it too much
 khaas baat ye he ki ise neckband style vaala banaaya gaya he, taaki colling ke liye ise aasaani se upyog kiya ja sake
 Talking about such old models, a thicker plastic body was used in the neck, whereas thinner memory wire has been used here
 donon taraf ke yearphone ko kaanon main behatar fitting ke liye khaas angel se dizin kiya gaya he
 Also, eartips will be available to customers in different sizes
 saath hi aapako bataa den ki donon yearphone ke back main magnets die gaye hai, jisase upyog naa kiye jane par donon yearphone ko chipka kar rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In addition, they also perform many functions
 is hedset main die gaye batan kii baat karen to yahaan ek taraf ke microphone main multi batan or wolum batan die gaye hai
 Also there is a light indicator here
 inhen kaa upyog kol risive karne, cat karne, redayal karne, mujeec trek ko reverse-forwad karne or wolum or kam-zyada karne main kiya jaataa he
 Along with this, one touch button has also been given to activate the virtual assistant
 parformens or sound:is hedset ko bluetooth ke jariye behatar colling kii suvidha dene ke lihaaj se dizin kiya gaya he
 As far as connectivity is concerned, Bluetooth connectivity does not go here at all
 kol ke dauraan sound quality kii baat karen to wo bhi kaaphi clear he
 It uses two microphones exclusively for noise cancellation
 yani duusare and par aap jisase baat kar rahe hai wo aapaki aawaaj kaaphi bheed-bhaad vaale ilaake main bhi behatar tareeke se sun saktaa he or is feechar ko bhi company ne kaaphi behatar tareeke se achiv kiya he
 Apart from this, now talk about the magnets present in it, as soon as you attach the magnets, this headset goes off completely
 jab aap in magnets ko alag-alag karenge to waapas ye aapke divaais se conect ho jaataa he
 But i think this function is a problem
 pehali baat kyonki agar is hedset ko nikaalar kahin bag main rakhte hai or aapane menuali ise of nahin kiya he to aapaki bina jaankaree ke ye khud hi conect ho jaataa he
 Secondly, even after the magnets were attached to the old model Elite 25e, the headset remained connected to the smartphone, so any call would be received as soon as you separated the magnets, the phone was directly received
 lekin yahaan magnet alag karne ke baad divaais se conect hone main hedset ko samay lagata he, jisase phone uthaane main samay lagata he
 That is, you have to wait until the headset is connected
 aamtaur par log phone dekhte hi sidhe uthaa lete hai
 Apart from this, comparing the old model to this model, in spite of all the good technology of calling, i found it a bit unsuccessful
 pehali vajah to magnet kii connactivity thi
 Now the second is that the older model was given a big plastic neckband body, which automatically started to vibrate on the call
 aise main kol aane kii jaankaree ho jaati thi
 There is no information about this until you hear the phone ringtone or the headset is placed on the ears
 aise main aapako phone ke wibrasion yaa ringtone ko on rakhana hoga yaa baar-baar phone dekhnaa hoga
 While the old model did not feel the need to repeatedly touch the phone
 saath hi aapako bataa den is hedset main kisi kol ke aane par collar ke number ko bataaya jaataa he jabaki uske naam ko bataae jane kii zyada jarurat he kyonki har insaan ko naam yaad hota he itnaa sara number yaad karnaa zyada mushkil he
 Apart from this, during the call from this headset, the information about waiting call is not available, in such a way, if you talk to someone for a long time, then you may be missing your important call while waiting
 in sabake alaava bhi sabase zyada samasya colling main ai jahaan kisi insaan se baat karte vakt agar aap jaraa sa bhi dhimaa bolen to saamne vaale ko aawaaj hi nahin aati
 Sometimes it is felt that even when talking loudly when the battery is low, the front person gets little voice
 aise main mike ko munh ke zyada kareeb laane par hi baat ho paati he yaa aapako jor se bolnaa hoga
 Now after this, if we talk about the audio quality of this headset, then you also cannot say it much better
 kyonki jis keemat main ise cell kiya ja rahaa he usamen ek behatar audio output kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 The biggest drawback is its lack of audio
 yani ek behatar se behatar audio player ke saath bhi thodi laudnes miss karenge
 However, despite increasing the voice completely, you will not get any noise, which is a positive point
 iske alaava isaki base quality or saround aapako niraash karegi
 You cannot put it in the local headphone category but you will miss the panchi base and surround
 Treble ke liye is headphone kaa zyada jhukaav he
 That is, you will get nothing more than a flat audio quality
 saath hi yugers Jabra Sound+ ap se kuch settings edjust kar sakate hai
 However, here too, something magical will not touch you
 bydaree:company kaa daawa he ki is headphone ko single charge ke baad 8 ghante tak chalaaya ja saktaa he or yahaan company kaa daawa sahi thahartaa he
 However, with noise cancellation, its battery lasts for about 6 hours
 yani ek bluetooth hedset ke lihaaj se isaki parformens kaaphi behatar he
 The special thing is that after 15 minutes of charging, it can be run for about half an hour
 faisla:bluetooth hedset category main is divaais ko jis price range main rakhaa gaya he, us lihaaj se ise khareednaa mahangaa sabit ho saktaa he
 Because its performance is not very attractive in terms of audio quality, nor have we found this headset better for calling
 jahaan tak bild quality or luk kii baat he to wo kaaphi behatar he
 Also, the battery does not leave soon
 aise main bazaar main uplabdh duusare products ko tri kiya ja saktaa he

 5 / 5 The Samajwadi Party has removed the leader who sought to make terrorist Yakub Memon's wife Raheen an MP
 mumbai main samaajawaadee party ke pradesh upaadhyaksh mohammad faruk ghosi ne party supremeo mulaayam singh yadav ko patr likhakar maang rakhi thi
 Many Muslim organizations and leaders have protested the execution of the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts convict
 isi kram main sapa kii maharashtra ikai ke upaadhyaksh ne party adhyaksh ko patr likhakar yaqub kii patni ko saansad banane kii maang kii
 For this, Farooq had also cited socialist values, describing Raheen Memon as helpless
 ghosi ne patr main likhi thim ye batenghosi ne patr main likhaa tha, 'court ne yaqub ko doshi qaraar diya or unki patni raheen memon ko bari kar diya, joki unheen ke saath giraftaar hui thim or kai saal jail main bhi raheen
 How much trouble will be right, and it is a quality of our socialists that it is necessary to speak the mind
 raheen asahaay lag rahi hai or unki madad karnaa samaajwaadiyon kaa ferj he
 'he said that Muslims also consider themselves helpless
 hamen saath dena chahie or raheen yaqub memon ko sansad sadsy banaakar unhen asaaayon kii aawaaj banane dena chahie
 This is an irresponsible statement
 sp's Maharashtra President Abu Azmi has called for Ghosi's remarks, calling him "personal" and "irresponsible"
 azmi ne kaha, ‘unhone (ghosi) gaiyr-jimmedaarana tippanee karne se pehle party se sampark nahin kiya
 He has written this letter privately
 unase apana ruukh spasht karne ke liye kaha jayega jiske baad unke khilaaf aavashyak karrwai kii jaaegi
 The congress-bjp also said that the Congress has said that the decision to sentence Memon to death is the decision of the Supreme Court and therefore it should not be given political color
 congress pravaktaa sachin saavant ne kaha, ‘yah unka apana aantarik maamla he lekin aisa prathit hota he ki unka agenda mudde ko sampradayik mode dena he
 BJP leader Madhav Bhandari said Ghosi's comments prove that the Samajwadi Party is simply interested in vote-bank politics and the party should clear its stand on the issue

 Team India's opener Murali Vijay's poor form (?) Before the Mumbai Test was being cited as a cause for concern
 media main report ai thim ki england ke tej gendbaaj short pich gendon ke 'asr' kaa istemaal karke vijay ko na sirf pareshaan kar rahe hai balki out karne main bhi kaamyaab ho rahe hai
 In this period of criticism, which started only after one or two consecutive matches of failure, people (media and cricket critics too) almost forgot that it was the same Vijay who scored an excellent century in the Rajkot Test
 yah ascharyajanak he ki bharat-england siries kaa chauthaa test shuru hone ke pehle tak pehle test kii vah behtareen pari bhula di gai
 However, even after these questions raised on the batting of Murali Vijay, coach Anil Kumble was confident about his opener
 mumbai test ke pehle media brifing main ve vijay ke paksh main khulkar bole
 'jumbo' had said, 'it would not be right to consider Vijay's recent dismissal on short pitch balls
 vijay pichley do varshon main hamaara lagaataar acha pradarshan karne vaala ballebaaj rahaa he
 He scored a century in Rajkot
 haa, vah ek jaisi gendon par out hua,isliye aap ise uski kamajori ke rup main dikhaa sakate hai lekin meraa maananaa he ki yah sahi nahin he
 He is such a batsman that we think he will score big soon
 ’ kumble ne yah bhi kaha tha ki team prabandhan net par murali vijay kii ballebaaji par nigaah jamaaye he or unki madad kar rahaa he
 The comments kumble kii kahi baat ko murali vijay ne aaj sahi sabit kiya
 He silenced his critics while completing a century on the second day of the match
 vijay ne vaaki behtareen pari kheli
 However, before his half-century on the first day of the match, Vijay also gave the England team a chance when wicketkeeper Bairstow missed a ball off Adil Rashid
 aisa lagata he ki mukaddar bhi vijay ke bada score banane or coach kumble kii baat sahi sabit hone ke paksh main tha
 Vijay's coming into form (in the sense that critics were questioning his form) is good news for the Indian team management
 siries main ab tak opening saajhedaari team india ke liye chintaa kaa kaaran rahi he
 It is expected that after Vijay's bat runs out again, the pressure on the forward batsmen will be removed
 
 
 baharhaal, murali vijay kii ballebaaji par uthe in sawaalon ke baad bhi coach anil kumble apane openar ko lekar aashwast dikhe
 In the first media briefing of the Mumbai Test, he spoke openly in favor of Vijay
 'jambo' ne kaha tha, 'vijay ke haal main short pich gendon par out hone ko unki kamajori maananaa sahi nahin hoga
 Vijay has been our consistent performer in the last two years
 usne rajkot main shatak banaaya tha
 Yes, he was out on similar balls, so you can show this as his weakness but i believe it is not right
 vah aisa ballebaaj he jiske bare main hamen lagata he ki vah jald hi bada score banayega
 'kumble also said that the team management has looked at the batting of Murali Vijay on the net and is helping him
 tippaniyan Murali Vijay justified Kumble's statement today
 match ke duusare din shatak puraa karte hue unhone apane aalochakon ke munh band kar die
 Vijay played a really good innings
 haalanki match ke pehle din apane ardhashatak se pehle vijay ne england team ko ek mauka bhi diya tha jab adil raashid kii gend par wicketiper beresto unhen stump karne se chook gaye the
 It seems that Muqaddar was also in favor of Vijay getting a big score and proving Coach Kumble's point right
 vijay kaa form main aana ( is lihaaj se ki aalochak unke form par sawaal uthaa rahe the) bhartiya team management ke liye acchhee khabar he
 Opening partnership in the series so far has been a cause for concern for Team India
 ummid he ki vijay ke balle se phir ran nikalne ke baad aage ke ballebaajon par se dabaav hatega

 The Bihar government has planned to promote rural tourism
 baarikiyon ko samaj sakenge paryatakaparyatak ab mithilanchal ke gaanvon main jaakar madhubani painting kii baarikiyon ko kareeb se dekh or samaj sakenge
 This well-known folk art of the state will not only be encouraged by the new scheme, but it will also bring the influx of tourists to the villages

 Now the state government wants to capitalize on this fame

 Madhubani paintings in handicraft exhibitions and emporiums attract people, but they are not aware of its reality and artists and they cannot find answers to the questions that are arising in their mind
 yah tabhi sambhav he jab paryatakon kaa dhyaan mithilanchal ke gaanvon kii ore aakrisht kiya jaae
 The tourism minister of Yojnarajya, Sunil Kumar Pintu, named 'rural Tourism', told that now tourists will be able to come to the villages of Bihar and stay with the artists and get familiar with the nuances of Madhubani painting
 unhone kaha ki 'gramin paryaton' ke naam se prarambh hone ja rahi is yojana ko jald hi antim rup diya jayega
 Initially this scheme will be started from Madhubani
 madhubani ke sameepvarti gaanv jitwarpur, ranti, mangarauni va koilakh main is painting ke kalakaron kii sankhya adhik he
 After this, other areas of Mithilanchal will also be included in this plan
 kalakaaron ko milegaa anudaanparyaton vibhaag ke ek adhikari ke anusaar madhubani ke aise gaanvon kaa chayan shuru kar diya gaya he jahaan madhubani style ke chitra banane vaale kalakaar rahete hai
 He informed that the department will contact these artists and grant them and ask them to develop their houses
 unhone bataaya ki kalakaaron ke gharon main parmparik tareeke se sajaa ek cameraa banaaya jayega or vahaan pashchimi va bhartiya style ke rasoighar va shauchalay kaa nirmaan karaayaa jayega
 Tourists will be accommodated in the homes of artists and a fee will be set by the department for their stay and food
 isse hone vaali aay par puri tarah ghar ke maalik kaa adhikaar hoga
 Pintu says that this proposal will soon be taken to the meeting of the Council of Ministers and the plan will be implemented as soon as it is approved
 unhone kaha ki iske alaava lahathi udyog sahit anya kai prasiddh kalaon ko bhi gramin paryaton yojana main shaamil kiya jayega
 It is said that Madhubani art has been developed over the years and it has started to appear on the walls of houses, not only in costumes and textiles
 chitrakaari ke jaankaar bhi maanate hai ki kalantar main iskaa vishay badalata ja rahaa he
 This art has gained international fame due to the efforts of Upendra Maharathi
 ek samay bhagwaan ram, janaki, lakshmana, sahit kai devi-devataaon tathaa puranic vishyon par kendrit chitrakaari hi hoti thi lekin ab paryaavaran sangrakshan, gramin parivesh jaise vishay bhi isamen shaamil kiye ja rahe hai
 It is also very popular in Japan that this painting is also popular in Japan

 bhale hi yah koi bahut badi samasya nahin he lekin is vajah se pet main baccha paidaa karte vakt hone vaale dard se zyada tej dard hota he''
 i had several white doctors / nurses think i was faking some serious mofo pain, because they assumed i wanted drugs
 Turns out i had an ovarian cyst burst
 Not a giant emergency, but easily pain worse than childbirth (I have three children)

 It is also being discussed between the two that they also gave money to the party but not 1000 crores
 tippaniyan In fact, Yeddyurappa had alleged that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah gave 1000 crore rupees to the party high command in order to stay in power and at the same time a diary was mentioned that he would send diary agencies from the house of Siddaramaiah's close MLC Govind Raju Miley in which all these transactions are mentioned

 The Congress had denied the seizure of any such diary and questioned that if there is any such diary, then what investigation agencies gave Yeddyurappa its information
 maamla tool pakad chukaa tha
 As a part of this, a controversial CD was released by the Congress, in which there is a controversial conversation between Yeddyurappa and Ananth Kumar

 Surprisingly, our police think the same from Kashmir to Kanyakumari
 use lagata he ki jo dukaane vagairah der raat tak khule rahete hai vahaan sirf badmaash hi jutate hai
 And the only way to deal with it is to stop everything
 jo achche log sadak par kabhi nikal bhi aaen to unhen itnaa dhamkaao ki waapas kabhi raat main naa nikalen
 When crime in Goa started increasing, the first thing was done by the police by quickly closing the shops there
 unhen lagata he ki isse khauf paidaa hoga jo aparaadh rokegaa
 However, till now the police has not been able to present any such data, so that if the shops are open at night, crime will increase

 Roads were illuminated

 But after the bomb blasts and terrorist incidents, the whole city went under the shadow of fear
 log gharon ko jaldi jane lage, baar, dance baar band hone lage, restraan, pub ke shater girane lage, texiyaan raat main milanaa dushwaar hone laga or dhire-dhire mumbai ko bhi der raat se dar lagane laga
 This is the shadow of fear that Mumbai once again wants to overcome, other parts of the country may not be able to do the same but Mumbai will have to set an example that it is not afraid of the night

 sani deol ke bete karan deol film pal pal dil ke paas film se apane bollywood kariyar kii shuruyaat karne ja rahe hai
 Apparently, he grew up in a very protective environment because of Sunny Deol as father and Dharmendra as grandfather
 karan deol apni previllettes ko sweekaarte bhi hai, lekin haal hi main unhone superstar family main paidaa hone ke negative effects ke bare main baat kii he
 In an interview with Facebook page Humans of Bombay, Karan said, "my first memory of school is from the first class
 hamaara ek sports compatishan hua karata tha or main ek res main bhaag le rahaa tha
 i was standing there and some big class kids surrounded me
 "karan ne bataaya, "ek ne mujhe uthaaya or sabake saamne neeche patake diya
 Then asked me are you really the son of Sunny Deol? Because you are unable to fight even
 mujhe us samay kaaphi sharmindagi hui thi
 "karan said," but even then things did not get much better for me
 yaa to bachche mujhe jaj karte yaa meraa majaak udaate or yahaan tak kii teachers bhi aisa hi kar rahe the
 Once when i did not make my assignment properly, a teacher came and told me that you can only write your father's checks correctly and nothing else
 "view this post on instagramthank You for the feature @officialhumansofbombay ・・・ “the first memory i have of school, was when i was in 1st grade
 We had a sports competition and i was taking part in a race
 i was standing there, when suddenly a few older boys surrounded me
 One of them lifted me up, and in front of everyone, smacked me down
 He then asked me, ‘are you sure you’re Sunny Deol’s son? You can’t even fight back’
 i was so embarrassed
 It didn’t get any easier from there
 Most kids would either judge me or make fun of me, and even the teachers were the same
 Once when i didn’t do well in an assignment, in the middle of the class, a teacher came up to me and said, ‘you’re only capable of writing your dad’s cheques, and nothing else
 'my mom was my only support through all of this, she kept telling me,' they're saying these things because that's how they are as people, it says nothing about you
 ’ And that kept me going
 It was tough but i had to stand up for myself, and answer back instead of giving up and backing down
 i had to understand that no one else, but me had the right to decide my worth
 i think my turning point was when my school was hosting a talent competition, and i decided to take part
 i realised that this was a chance to prove myself
 i spent night after night, preparing a rap - because that's the only thing i knew i was good at
 On the day, i remember walking up on that stage, and there was a sea of people, with all eyes on me
 But i took a deep breath, and performed my heart out
 All the years of being bullied, of being ridiculed, of being identified as nothing else but ‘sunny Deol’s son’, came out when i was up on that stage
 The audience was cheering me on too - i felt so liberated; like I'd finally break free from the shackles
 It took time, but that moment changed my life
 i realised that sometimes, it doesn't take people, and situations, to make your life better
 It takes a strong belief in yourself, the power to see yourself for who you are, and not the way others want you to be
 You're not made to fit into molds, you're made to create your own identity - one that's unlike anyone else's
 ”A post shared bykaran Deol(@imkarandeol) onaug 29, 2019 at 10:50pm pdtkarana ne kaha, in sabake bich meri maa ne meraa bahut samarthan kiya
 She used to tell me that they are saying this because they are like that as a human being
 lekin inase tumhaare kairactor par koi sawaal nahin uthaa saktaa he
 It would have given me courage to listen to my mother
 mujhe ehsaas hua ki koi or nahin balki mujhe khud apane aapako sabit karnaa hoga
 Karan said, "I think the turning point came for me when i had a talent competition at my school and i decided to participate in it
" is sho ke liye maine kaaphi din apane rap par mehnat kii
 Because by that time i was only good at rap
 mujhe yaad he, main stage par pahunchaa tha or logon kaa hujum vahaan maujuud tha, lekin maine gahari saans lee or apni parformens shuru kii or thodi hi der baad audiyans bhi mujhe saport kar rahi thi
 "" That moment had changed my life
 mujhe ehsaas hua ki aapaki jindagi logon yaa paristhitiyon ke chalate nahin, balki apane aap main vishwaas rakhane ke chalate chijen behatar hoti hai
 You are not made to fit into a structure but to seek your own identity
 " What to say if you get a chance to connect with your past under the pretext of work

 party ke netaa kah rahe hai ki bijepi ke saath sarkaar phir se kyon banaai jaae, kyonki kashmir main farty janaadhar khisakta najar aa rahaa he
 Most PDP leaders believe that there is a difference of ground and sky in the ideology of both BJP and PDP
 lihaaja yah milan bahut zyada din tak jari nahin rah saktaa
 It is also being said that PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti has already decided about it, the announcement is yet to be made
 log jaanate hai ki mahabuuba yah jokhim lene se peeche nahin hatengi
 Significantly, for the sake of vote bank, Mehbooba's own party had dropped the government in 2008 by withdrawing support from Congress
 pidipi ko congress se pratyaksh or neshnal conference se apratyaksh taur par samarthan die jane kaa ofer mil rahaa he to agar pidipi agar bijepi ke saath 10 maah puraane gathbandhan ko todane kaa faisla leti he to kisi ko hairaani nahin hogi
 On the other hand, Farooq Abdullah of the National Conference has created politics by saying that if there is a proposal from the BJP on forming a government, then he is ready to consider it

 " hollywood ke mashhoor abhinayta leonardo dicapriyo pichley kai varshon se lagaataar hit film de rahe hai
 But unfortunately they have not been able to win an Oscar award
 haalanki vah kai dfa golden globe aword jarur jeet chuke hai
 But just imagine how many times Leonardo would have received the award if he were in India
 vaise bahut sambhav he ki sirf unhen aword dene ke liye hi koi puraskaar samaaroh shuru kar diya jaataa
 The number of award ceremonies in Bollywood has now crossed hands
 unamem puraskaar shreniyon kii baat karen to samaaroh dar samaaroh aisi vruddhi hoti he ki bramha bhi bhavishyavaanee na kar saken
 As a result, neither the actors nor their fans now value these awards
 alam yah he ki kabhi hindi cinema main jo actors 'blike ladi' ko chune ke liye tarasate the, vahiin ab khuleam aise samarohon kidhajjiyaan udaane se nahin chookte
 Every year, some stars are seen falling out of these awards
 aamir khan or ajay devgan jaise sitare ateet main yah karnama kar chuke hai to bollywood kii 'queen' kangana ranot ne bhi kaha vah jaanati hai ki ye commercial samaaroh hai or inkaa uddeshy tiarapy or paisa kamanaa he
 Not only this, she considers them only as Jalsa
 haal hi main akshay kumaar bhi puraskaron ke liye lobing kii baat ko khuleam kah chuke hai
 The amazing and amazing awards were recently seen at an award ceremony in the Best Supporting Actor category
 is katagori main navazuddin siddiki bhi the, jinhen 'badlapur' ke liye nominete kiya gaya tha
 Although his acting in 'barjarangi Bhaijaan' was awesome, but Anil Kapoor (dil Dhadakne Do) won the award along with aan-baan and Shaan
 ek aisi film jo box offis par ausat rahi thi or darshakon ke bich apni jagah nahin bana saki thi
 Well, let's do the jury's will
 singer lokapriy, lekin aword ke 'sur' main khamisangit hindi cinema kii pahchaan rahi he
 The music of 'roy', one of the biggest flop films of this year, is being appreciated in every film festival
 shaayad isaki vajah isaki mujeec company bhi ho sakati he, kyonki jitna bada naam, utana bada inam
 Not only this, to satisfy everyone, from the best music director to the best music album like Katakagari has also been made
 alam yah he best singer kaa aword sabase chahete ko to miltaa he, lekin jis song ke liye miltaa he vah logon kii plalist se kaaphi pehle gaayab ho chukaa hota he
 Come and get the fun of the exercises
 If you feel that no one is getting satisfied then make a new Katagiri for him
 jaise aksar hota he
 Different actors are now given every award, ranging from Popular Choice, to Best Actor, Critical Choice
 phir bhi agar kahin kasar rah jaati he yaa koi naaraaz hota he to isse itar fitness se lekar or duusare aword opshan bhi talash liye jate hai
 The actor has been awarded the award for promotion campaign for his films many times, not right
 or agar itane se baat na bane to 'antertainer of da year' yaa phir 'power packed parformens of da year' to he hi
 Keep an eye on the chair and camera, as well, this award is becoming quite obsolete
 aapako thodi-si parkhi najar chahie
 Connoisseurs looked like that when the camera is put on the people present in the prom, you see who has come
 kitna taiyaar hokar aayaa he
 Where is it placed bas samaj aa jayega ki koun vijeta he
 This time the same thing happened in an award ceremony
 sitaron ko dekh-dekhakar andaja lag gaya
 Parineeti looked at Chopra in front of him
 wo sajadhaj kar poj main baithi hui thim
 Had to give performance
 lekin ye kya, bina bade parde par chhap chode hi unhen 'style iken of da year' bana diya gaya
 Now call it award, luck or something else is yours
 tiarapy kaa khelbollywood ke puraskaar samaaroh auskar kii tarah live nahin aate hai
 Only their recording is shown
 vajah tivi ke liye mote sponcer dhunde jate hai or primetime par inako laayaa jaataa he
 Due to which the TRP bounces, it also earns
 ab jab itnaa kuch daanv par laga ho to kadam to phoonk-foonkkar uthaane banate hi hai
 The eyes of the audience get pleasure, so veteran superstars are found so that they can perform on stage
 yahi parformens puraskaar samarohon se jude promo ke dauraan dikhaai jaati he
 People are very tempted so that TRP can be good
 aise main agar kuch sitaron ko khush karne ke liye ek do catagori shuru bhi kar deen to kya fark padataa he
 Just because of this, these award ceremonies are losing their importance and are turning into entertainment related programs
 yahaan copicat kyon nahin banateher kadam par hollywood ko copy karne vaale bollywood ko filmon or idiaj ke alaava ab aword samaaroh yojit karnaa bhi siikhnaa chahie
 It is probably time for Hindi cinema to maintain its dignity, because everything is not entertainment-entertainment and entertainment
 or agar bhartiya cinema ke kathith sadhak itane hi laaparvaah hai to vah din dur nahin jab gambhir sitare aword samarohon se nadaarad ho jaaenge

 The neighboring country Pakistan has postponed all kinds of talks between the two countries till the results of the Lok Sabha elections in India
 pakistan ke soochna prasaaran vibhaag ke mantri fawaad choudhary ne kaha he ki islamabad nai dilli ke saath bharat main chunaav prakriya ke samaapt hone ke baad nae sire se baatcheet kaa icchhuk he
 Because in the wake of general elections in India, it is not the right time to negotiate between the current political turmoil
 islamabad kii taraf se yah bayaan tab aayaa he jab sindhu nadi samjhaute ko lekar pakistan kaa teen sadasyeey pratinidhimandal bharat aayaa he
 Fawad Chaudhary, a minister in the Pakistan government, said, "this is not the right time to talk about the turmoil in Indian politics
" hamane bharat ke saath baatcheet ke prayaas taal die hai kyonki ham maujuuda bhartiya netritv kii taraf se kisi bade faisle kii ummid nahin karte
 He said that unless there is some stability, talking to India is futile
 chunaav ke baad nai sarkaar ke gathan ke baad ham is silsile ko aage badhayenge
 Earlier, Pakistan has been saying that there was no positive response from New Delhi on the many initiatives taken by it on its behalf
 haalanki bharat kii taraf se hameshaa is baat ko doharaaya gaya he ki jab tak islamabad aatankwaad ko prashray dena band nahin karata tab tak donon deshon ke bich koi thos baatcheet sambhav nahin he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently said in an interview to a news agency that India is ready to negotiate on any issue with Pakistan, but the noise of the conversation is often suppressed in the noise of bombs and guns
 haalanki pakistan ke mantri fawaaj choudhary kaa maananaa he kartaar poor coridor ke khulanaa donon padosi deshon ke sambandhon ko banane main mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa kar saktaa he
 Chaudhary hoped that a new leadership government would be formed in India and said that Pakistan will take steps to negotiate with whoever comes to power in India
 aapako bataa den ki kartarpur coridor sambandhi masaude ko antim rup dene ke liye pakistan ne bhartiya pratinidhimandal ko baatcheet ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 But on behalf of India, the Pakistani delegation was asked to come to New Delhi and two possible dates for this meeting - 26 February and 7 March were suggested
 bharat ke is jawaab par islamabad kii taraf se kadi pratikriya jataate hue videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa ne kaha tha ki hamaare prastaav par nai dilli kaa jawaab bachakaana he, lekin hamaara jawaab paripakv hoga

 aam taur par yah dekha gaya he ki bharat main jo company bazaar kaa survey karti he, vahi raajnneetik surveykshan bhi karti he
 However, there are some companies that have adopted some methods from the US and Europe
 bazaar kaa survey mukhya taur se kisi khaas utpaada ke liye hota he, jisamen log apni kray shakti ke saath-saath gunatmak or maatraatmak taur par raay dete hai
 The choice of the public is different in terms of government selection
 yahi vajah he ki ye companiyaan bhartiya samaaj kii jatilta samaj nahin paatin or basapa ke votaron or uske matdaan pattern ko samajhane main naakaam rahati hai
 First, all companies take a small sample, which does not represent an accurate representation, so it does not lead to authentic conclusions
 duusare, in companiyon ke paas prashikshit or matadaataaon kii pravriti samajhane vaale log nahin hote
 Whereas for an effective sampling and analysis, it is necessary to understand about the BSP voters who live in illiterate, silent and slums
 aankade ikatthe karne se pehle is tarah ke uttardaataaon se behatar sampark banane kii jarurat he
 The urban, untrained, machine-like figure-maker remains aware of his caste, so far from making contact, he does not collectively care about this attitude
 teesri baat yah he ki surveykshankartaaon ke paas aisi koi paddati nahin he ki ve basapa ke un khamosh votaron kii pratikriya bhaanp saken, jo khaskar gramin ilaake main apane virodhiyon ke dar se chup rahete hai
 Fourth, surveyors are often completely unaware of the classification of castes and their likes and dislikes
 udhaaharan ke taur par, upi main 66 anusuchit jati, pichde varg kii 79 jatiyaan hai or musalamaanon main bhi darjan bhar jatiyaan hai
 While in the others there are many castes in the three varna Brahmins, Rajputs and Vaishyas
 sabase badi chunauti in jatiyon main se namoona lene kii he
 Who has the expertise to take such a sample? The surveyors emphasize only three characters that are readily available to express more and more urban, vocal and opinion
 inhen purvagrahon kii vajah se chunaav ke purvanumaan or eczit pole ke nishkarshon main un galatiyon ko nahin joda jaataa
 Even if the results are not accurate, the figures do not look reliable

 Sharif's dream of merging Kashmir with Pakistan was shattered by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
 sushamaa ne sakht chetavanee ke saath kaha ki navaj sharif ke qayaamat tak khwab puraa nahin hoga

 lekin yah publicity stant, kiski publicity ke liye, kya deepika padukon kii? pehali baat to yah ki 'big bos' shuru ho chukaa he or deepika kisi wild card entry ke chakkar main to shaayad nahin hai
 Masha Allah, she is currently one of the most successful actresses and before that most of her films were successful without getting into any controversy
 ab to vah vishwa sundari pratiyogita main bhi hissaa nahin le sakati hai ki apni nariwadi chhavi ko manjh rahi hon
 Now talk about his film
 'finding pheni' ko dekhne jane ke liye pehle hi kai kaaran film main maujuud the
 An interesting promo
 manze hue kalakaar
 Those who have not seen the film, let me tell them that this film does not propagate or propagate the feminist perspective far and wide
 phir aise main yah vivaad is film ke liye darshakon kii utsukata ko kaise janm detaa he? If the film is controversial, then definitely someone will be eager to watch it
 jaise 'ek choti-si lav story' ke drishyon kii vajah se nirdeshak or abhinetri manisha koirala ke bich vivaad hua or film ne darshakon ko khinchaa
 'delhi Bailey' came into the limelight due to the 'new Jane' dialogues in his film, which had abused use of abuses
 jaise camel hasan kii 'vishvarupam' jise muslim sanghathanon ke virodh ne hindi belt main bhi hit karvaa diya tha, lekin camel hasan ko kis maansik tanaav se guzaranaa padaa iskaa andaja lagaana bhi mushkil he
 Are we victims of some concept, if we feel that the protagonist or heroine of the film gets involved in a controversy before the performance of a film, then people will break up to watch the film? Is it necessary that whenever a hero or heroine is involved in a controversy, it is just an exercise for cheap popularity? Is it correct to think that people in the film world do not have condolences? If a woman is also a sex worker, does she not have the right to express her opinion or express her opposition? jo log bina film kaa sir-pair dekhe sirf kisi vivaad ke maddenzar film dekhne pahunch jate hai to isse behatar popcorn to aap apane ghar hi kha lete
 There must be some such people, but how to assume the hypothesis that people will go to see the film after listening to the news of Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor's personal moments MMS, thinking that the entire clip will be seen there
 marketing kii apni ek duniya he
 He also has his own strategy
 kaaphi log kisi naa kisi tarah iskaa istemaal karte hai
 It is also being used in politics
 log vot bhi de dete hai, lekin is theory ko aap kis tark par pramanit karenge ki vivaad kisi film ke liye darshak juta detaa he or phir vah hit bhi ho jaati he
 If someone wants to do research, then also do research on which controversies or promos or marketing strategy make Sajid Khan's clumsy movies and earns crores and many films have won awards in films and their ' Despite being a bold subject, Hindi cinema audiences do not smell them

 aam aadmi party sarkaar or dilli ke teenon nagar nigam ke bich jhagada kisi se chupa nahin he
 The public is directly suffering from this quarrel
 or ye vahi janata he, jise smart city or world class city kaa sapana dikhaakar vot batore jate hai
 But after power comes in, politics becomes so dominant that it does not take long to convert the city into a garbage dump
 lekin sawaal ye uthta he ki is jhagade kaa ant kab hoga kyonki 2 oktober ko desh svachh bharat abhiyaan kii duusari saalagirah manaane ja rahaa he
 To find out the answer to many questions, Aaj Tak has had a special conversation with Minister Satyendra Jain in the Delhi government
 satyendra jain ne jawaab kii shuruyaat aarope se karte hue kaha ki svachh bharat abhiyaan kii tasviir to bahut khubasurat dikhaai gai thi, aisa lag rahaa tha ki 2 maheene main dilli saaf ho jaaegi lekin bijepi shasit teenon emsidi ne puure desh or pradhanmantri ko sharmasaar kar diya he
 The capital of the country has been piled up
 safai karne kii jimmedaari emsidi kii he, iske baavjood dilli sarkaar ne milakar kaam karne kii koshish kii thi
 We removed thousands of truck garbage which was not our job
 lekin emsidi kii taraf se koi sahyog nahin mila
 Face-to-face with cleanliness, the MCD and the government remind you that the Kejriwal government had also launched a mobile application called 'swachh Delhi' to make the country's capital free of garbage
 jisamen daawa kiya gaya tha ki kisi ilaake, gali yaa mohalle main kooda failaa he to uski tasviir 'svachh dilli' aplicoshan ke jariye sarkaar ko bhejkar safai karvaa sakate hai
 But this application seemed to be spreading all over
 iske baavjood kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ne khud mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke saath milakar kaam karne kaa vaada kiya tha, dilli ko svachh banane kaa ye saath zyada lanbaa nahin chal paaya
 At present, a quarrel between the MCD and Kejriwal government regarding the fund is now common
 piem bulaaen emsidi kii baithkmantri satyendra jain se jab 'svachh dilli' aplicoshan ke bare main sawaal poocha to unhone bijepi ko hi katghare main khadaa kar diya
 Satyendra Jain said that BJP people are creating misunderstandings in public
 bijepi ke log jaanboojhkar gandagi failaa rahe hai, isliye pradhanmantri se haath jodakar nivedan karuunga kii dilli desh kii rajdhani he or puure desh kii rajaneta dilli aate hai
 Delhi is a mirror of the country, if there is no cleanliness of the whole country, at least clean Delhi
 pradhanmantri ko emsidi ko maheene main ek baar jarur bulaanaa chahie
 'BJP is not allowing work' Satyendar Jain claims every time that cleaning is not the work of Delhi government
 unhone kaha ki sabakaa kaam fiks he
 Cleanliness is the responsibility of 80 thousand employees in MCD
 iske alaava hajaar karod rupye se zyada kaa theka kooda uthaane kaa diya gaya he
 If the contractor is not picking up the garbage, then why is the MCD paying him the money? MCD leaders are falling
 afasar or karmchaaree kaam karte hai lekin bijepi vaale unhen kaam nahin karne dete hai
 Other councilors just keep collecting money and do no work
 aage unhone kaha ki agar emsidi apane safai karwaane vaale fund kaa hissaa dilli sarkaar ko saunp den, to sarkaar puri dilli kii safai kii jimmedaari apane haath main lene ko taiyaar he
