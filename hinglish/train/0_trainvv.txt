 When the Lok Sabha election results came, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee could not believe it
 unhone khud ko apane ghar ke kamare main band kar liya, or phone par party ke netaaon par cheekh-chilla rahi thim
 Were they not to say "bayalishe Bayalish" (42 seats out of 42) in front of them? So, then how did BJP get 40 percent votes and 18 seats in West Bengal? Mamta, who left Kopbhavan after two days, simply said, "I do not accept these results
" ''trinmul congress (tiemasi) pramukh isliye bhi sadame main thim ki unki team main koi bhi aise nattejey kaa andaja nahin laga paaya

 Because his views on Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni differed from Srikanth's

 The AAP convenor and Arvind Kejriwal have put a stop to the speculation of Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alliance in Delhi in the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 kejariwal ne guuruuvaar ko press conference ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki dilli kii sabhi saaton siton par aap ummidavaaron ko jitaayen
 It is clear that in Delhi you will enter the election field alone
 darasal, congress kii kaman dilli main shila dikshit ke haathon main die jane ke baad mana ja rahaa tha ki congress or aap ke saath gathbandhan karke chunavi maidan main utregi
 But Kejriwal has made it clear that if Narendra Modi has to be defeated in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then by sending the candidates to all the seats of Delhi and sending them to Parliament so that Delhi can be given full statehood
 haalanki, dilli main aam aadmi party ne pradesh kii paanch loksabhaa siton par apane prabharee niyukt kar die hai
 All of them are constantly active in their respective constituencies
 aatishi ko purvi dilli seat, party pravaktaa dilip pandeya ko uttar purvi dilli, party ke rashtriya sachiv pankaj gupta ko chandani chowk kaa prabharee banaaya gaya he
 Raghav Chadha, the young leader of AAP treasurer, was appointed in-charge of north-west Delhi Lok Sabha constituency in South Delhi, while Guggan Singh Ranga, who came to AAP from BJP some time ago
 lekin nai dilli seat par pashchimi dilli seat par prabharee niyukt nahin kiya tha
 Now that Kejriwal has said that he has talked about all the seven seats, in such a situation, the remaining two seats will also have to be appointed in-charge
 haalanki, pichley loksabhaa chunaav main aam aadmi party ne sabhi saaton loksabhaa siton par chunavi maidan main utari thi, lekin unhen ek bhi seat par jeet nahin mili thi
 BJP won all the seven seats
 jabaki, 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main saaton siten congress ke khate main gai thi
 Let us tell that in the Delhi Assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party won 67 of the 70 seats in the state
 baaki 3 siten bijepi ko mili thi or congress khaataa bhi nahin khol saki thi
 In the last round of Lok Sabha elections, the political mercury of Purvanchal has risen sharply

 Therefore, Sheila Dixit also faced the anger of the people in many programs
 jaahir he vipaksh ko bhi sarkaar kii ghoshnaaon main sirf janata ke saath dhokhaa dikhaai de rahaa he
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia took a jibe at Sheila and said that if digging the pit wins, then we are also ready to dig the pit
 ek kahawat he- ant bhala to sab bhala
 By applying this formula, the Delhi government is desperate for the people to break the moon and stars

 Let us tell you how to make a Christmas party memorable: 1
 christmas kii party kii taiyaari aamtaur se log maheene bhar pehle karne lagate hai
 Christmas parties are common in pubs and discs
 magar kuch nae theme ko apanaakar aap apni is saal kii party ko yaadgaar bana sakate hai
 The party should be such that everyone from children to youth can enjoy this party to the fullest
 2
 First of all, make sure the location of the party according to your budget
 phir un mehmaanon kii list bana len or unhen samay par nyauta bhi de den
 After this, now comes the time, what fun activity will be kept during the party, also think about it among themselves
 sabase aakhir main shopping se bachane ke liye gift, kapade or khaane-pine ke saamaan bhi samay par kharid len
 3
 akasar log christmas party ke liye party planar rakhte hai, jiske jimme party kii sabhi taiyaari hoti hai
 But with a little understanding, you can also organize the party yourself
 chunki christmas party main family or frends donon hi shaamil hote hai isliye party kaa theme soch-samajhakar rakhana chahie
 4
 carol or prarthana sabha ke saath games, dance or logon kii mouj masti kaa puraa dhyaan rakhen
 If you want, keep games like 'find Santa Claus at a party' for children
 iske alaava bacchon ke carol gaan pratiyogita or kavita sunaao pratiyogita bhi rakh sakate hai
 5
 vaise to log bazaar se kharide hui gift dena pasand karte hai
 But this Christmas, you can give hand-made items and cards by an NGO
 story book, kitaaben, video games, ai pod, phani cap, santaklose ke kapade or khaane-pine kaa samaan gift ke rup main de sakate hai
 For elders, you can choose wine bottles, cake cookies, clothes etc
 according to your budget

 In the Holy Scriptures, Jesus is called the 'prince of Peace'
 isa hameshaa abhivadan ke rup main kehete the- 'shanti tumhaare saath ho

 Christmas is an important festival all over the world

 According to UN statistics, about 150 million people in the world are followers of Christianity

 Saint Yomus, one of the twelve disciples of Christ, came to South India in Bawan in the year AD
 unhone dakshin bharat ke kuch pracheen raajaaon ke mahal main bhi kaary kiye the
 Along with his works, Yomus preached the gospel of Jesus
 inase prabhavit hokar kuch brahmanon ne isai dharm grahan kiya
 For this reason many old churches are seen in South India
 shanti evam sadbhaavna isai dharm ke buniyadi adarsh hai
 During the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said- 'blessed are those who bring peace, because they will be called sons of God
 dharmik kattarpanth, purvaagrah, ghrinaa evam hinsa koi bhi dharm kaa aadhaar nahin ban saktaa he
 Forgiveness of others' mistakes is another important principle of Christianity
 ishwar ke nikat jane ke liye dusron kii galatiyon ko hriday se maaf karnaa nitant aavashyak he
 Jesus forgives his criminals, in the same way you forgive our crimes
 isa ke anusaar dusron ko maaf karne ke liye koi shart nahin rakhi janaa chahie

 However, the state education minister Archana Chitnis has denied that it has an adverse effect on children
 unhone kaha, 'yah sirf sarkari urdu skulon main lagu hoga
 What will be taught will not be the religious form of the Bhagavad Gita
 hamane kartavya, ajnapaalan, prem or jimmedaari kaa paath padhaane vaale kuch prasang bhar chune hai
 It is not right to call it saffronisation of education

 He said that people cannot be misled by getting stones, trust is when the work starts
 unhone kaha ki abhi jab mujhe rifinary vaale iske bare main bataa rahe the, to maine unase poocha ki udghaatan kii taarikh bataaie
 PM said that this time is a time of determination

 PM Modi also mentioned former Vice President Bhairo Singh Shekhawat, BJP leader Jaswant Singh during this period
 unhone kaha ki hamaare desh main itihaas ko bhula dene kii parampara rahi
 He said that the Israeli PM is visiting India these days, after the independence of the country i was the first PM who went to Israel
 unhone kaha ki jab main isroyal gaya to main hypha gaya, to pratham vishwayuddh main hypha ko mukt karaane ke liye jin bhartiya veeron ne balidaan diya tha unhen shradhanjali di
 During that time the troops were led by Major Dalpat Singh of Rajasthan
 dilli main teen murti chowk unki yaad main bana he, ab uskaa naam teen murti hypha chowk kar diya he
 Congress and famine twin brother PM said that earlier i used to hear that Congress and famine are twin brothers in Rajasthan, where the Congress will go, famine goes together
 unhone kaha ki sirf yahaan hi nahin balki kai jagah pathar lagaakar photo khichvaai gai he
 He said that talking big, misleading the public is part of the working style of the Congress
 unhone bataaya ki jab main piem bana to railway bajet dekha to 1500 se zyada aisi yojanaon kii ghoshnaa kii gai jo ajtak kaagaj main hi hai
 Our government did not do this for a few seconds
 unhone kaha ki jitna ho saktaa he ham utana hi bataaenge
 Our government fulfilled the dream of One rank-one Pension, which was stuck for 40 years
 congress ne antarim bajet main 500 karod rupye diya or puure chunaav main ise bhunaate rahe
 It was only stated in the budget but did not start work on it
 OROP par congress ko gheraapiem raily main bole ki sirf 500 karod rupee dekar kya sach main congress phogiyon kaa bhala karnaa chaahati thi, isamen kul kharchaa 12000 karod rupee kaa aayaa tha
 i told the soldiers that the government has a low budget, so cannot give it together

 vasundhara kaa sonia par warrajasthan kii siem vasundhara raaje ne raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki aaj kaa din rajasthan aitihaasik he
 He said that this dream was seen by our previous government, today it is being started only during the BJP government
 congress ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan chaar saal tak kuch nahin kiya, lekin chunaav ke samay aanan-fanan main sonia gandhi ko bulaakar iskaa shilanyas karavaaya
 He said that the intention of the Congress was not right for this project
 hamaari sarkaar ne vistaar se is yojana par kaam kiya he, sirf loklubhaavan kii baat nahin kii he
 Congress has opposed the Congress alleges that the foundation stone of this refinery was already done by the then Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 phir piem kyon aisa kar rahe hai
 Meanwhile, the political debate between the Congress and the ruling BJP of Rajasthan has intensified regarding the Barmer refinery
 rifinary ko lekar rajasthan ke purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne pradhanmantri se sawaal kiya tha ki rifinary kaa shilanyas phir se kyon kiya ja rahaa he, jab yah pehle hi 2013 main ho chukaa he
 The invitation letter distributed shortly thereafter reads 'work Inauguration Ceremony'
 gahalot ne is par twarit tippanee main kaha ki yah mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje sindhiya sarkaar kaa munh chhipaane jaisaa kadam he
 Interestingly, before the 2013 assembly elections, the Gehlot government called Sonia Gandhi and laid the foundation stone of the oil refinery
 vasundhara raaje ne satta main aate hi ise ghaataa kaa sauda bataakar band kar diya
 Now that assembly elections are due in 2018, Vasundhara Raje has called Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 16 to lay the foundation stone again
 purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot is maamle par bijepi par unheen ke hindu karm-cond kaa hawala dekar kah rahe hai ki ek jagah hue mantrocchar ke kaarykram ko radd kar usee jagah puja karnaa thik nahin he

 ा dilli sarkaar ne buudhvaar ko do bade tabadale kiye jisame dilli sarkaar main principal secretary services rahe anindo majumdaar ko aakhirkaar nayaa vibhaag dete hue dilli financiel korporation kaa siemdi niyukt kar diya or parimal raay principal secretary samaaj kalyaan banaae gaye hai
 The important thing is the posting of Majumdar
 ye dilli sarkaar kaa ek tir se do nishane ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 This gave the message in the bureaucracy that the government is not as strict towards them as it is being told or the atmosphere is building and another has tried to calm the ego of the Lieutenant Governor
 anindo majumdaar hi wo adhikari hai jinhone shakuntla gammlin ko alji ke aadesh par kaaryvahak mukhya sachiv niyukt kar diya jabaki dilli sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki ye niyukti bina uski sahmati ke hui or niyukti ke anindo majumdaar ko pad se hataa diya tha
 The comments iske baad alji ne dilli sarkaar kaa aadesh radd karne or majumdaar ko behaal karne kaa aadesh diya lekin sarkaar ne maanane se manaa kar diya or majumdaar ke daftar par taala jad diya tha
 LG later gave the order again but the government said that LG did not have the authority to give such orders and when the dispute went long, the Ministry of Home Affairs brought the notification
 mangalvaar ko siem kejariwal alji se mili or uske baad buudhvaar ko ye aadesh aaye hai
 That is, the resentment of the officers overall and the lg's attempt to have some value can be seen as an important step of the Kejriwal government in improving the situation
 ahm baat majumdaar kii posting he
 This is being seen as two targets of the Delhi Government with one stone
 isse afasarshahi main ye sandesh diya ki sarkaar unke prati utani sakht nahin jitani bataayi ja rahi he yaa jaisaa maahaul ban rahaa he or doosraa uparajyapal ke aham ko bhi shant karne kii koshish kii he
 Anindo Majumdar is the only officer who appointed Shakuntala Gamlin as acting chief secretary on the orders of LG, while the Delhi government said that the appointment was made without her consent and the appointment of Anindo Majumdar was removed
 tippaniyan The LG then ordered the Delhi government to cancel the order and reinstate Majumdar, but the government refused to oblige and had locked Majumdar's office
 alji ne baad main phir aadesh diya lekin sarkaar ne kah diya ki alji ko adhikaar hi nahin aise aadesh dene kaa or jab vivaad lanbaa chalaa to grih mantralay notification le aayaa
 CM Kejriwal met LG on Tuesday and after that orders have come on Wednesday
 yani kul milakar afasaron kii naaraazgi or alji kii baat kaa kuch maan rakhane kii koshish ko halaat sudhaarney kii disha main kejariwal sarkaar kaa ye ek ahm kadam mana ja saktaa he

 Now that Akshay Kumar's film Kesariya is going on Holi day on March 21, many people have become curious to know about the battle of Saragarhi
 lekin kam logon ko pataa hoga ki punjab ke amritsar main saragadha gurudwara bhi he
 The Saragarhi Gurdwara is located near the Town Hall and Swarnamandir in Amritsar
 gurudwara itnaa chota he ki aapaki najar shaayad hi is par pade
 But this small gurudwara has an indelible story of the courage of Sikhs
 yah kahani he saragadhi kii ladaai or usamen sikh sainikon kii bahaduree kii
 The special thing is that this Gurudwara was built in 1902 by the British themselves in memory of their 21 brave Sikh soldiers
 in sainikon ne saragadhi post ko bachaane ke liye apni jaan qurbaan kar di thi
 What was the Battle of Saragarhi The Battle of Saragarhi was fought on September 12, 1897 between 21 soldiers of the 36th Sikh Regiment and 10,000 Afghan tribesmen
 saragadhi ek us samay ke bharat ke north west frontier praant (vartmaan main pakistan) main angrejo kii ek sainik post thi
 British forces were stationed here to maintain occupation of areas adjoining Afghanistan
 is ilaake main kabje ko lekar afgaanon or angrejon ke bich lagaataar ladaaiiyaan hoti rahati thi
 Meanwhile, on September 12, 1897, between 10,000 and 12,000 Afghans from the Afridi and Aurakzai clan attacked the Saragarhi post
 saragadhi post aasapaas ke kilon ke bich signal dene kaa kaam karti thi
 The Saragarhi Fort was built on a hill between two forts Lockhart and Gulistan
 saragadhi kii suraksha ke liye hawaldaar ishar singh ke saath 20 sipaahiyon kaa dasta tainaat tha
 The Afghan enclosure was such that even help could not be sent from nearby forts
 kaha jaataa he ki afgaanon ke hamale ke baad in sipaahiyon se post khaali karke peeche hatane ke liye bhi kaha gaya tha, lekin in sipaahiyon ne sikh parampara apanaate hue marate dam tak dushman se ladane kaa faisla kiya
 Ishar Singh and his soldiers bravely faced the attack
 21 sipaahi puure din hajaaron kii sankhya main aae afgano se ladate rahe
 When the gunpowder ran out, he fought face to face with hands and bayonets
 aakhirkaar afgaanon ne saragadhi par kabja to kar liya, lekin is ladai main afgaanon ko bahut jaan kaa bahut nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 Due to this battle, the British army coming for help found time and the next day the British squad defeated the Afghans and captured Saragarhi again
 angrejon ke phir se kabje ke baad sikh sainikon kii jambaaji duniya ke saamne ai
 The British soldiers found the bodies of around 1400 Afghans there
 saragadhi par bache aakhri sipaahi gurmukh singh ne signal tower ke andar se ladate hue 20 afgaanon ko maar giraaya
 When the Afghans could not control the Gurmukh, they set the tower on fire and Gurmukh died alive
 sikh sainikon kii is bahaduree kii charchaa british sansad main bhi hui
 All the 21 brave Sikh soldiers who were martyred here were awarded the Indian Order of Marit, the largest gallantry award to the Indian soldiers at that time
 baad main isi ladaai ke smarak ke rup main angrajon ne amritsar, ferozepur or wajiristaan main teen gurudware banawaye
 Saragarhi Day is still observed on 12 September in memory of this battle
 unesco ne saragadhi kii ladaai kii ginati duniya main ajtak sabase veertapurna tareeke se ladi gai 8 ladaayeeyon main kii he

 Former cricketer and commentator Sanjay Manjrekar has called Dhoni the best captain in the world and also said that he is equal to half the team
 world cap shuru hone main ab ek maheene se bhi kam kaa vakt rah gaya he or sabhi timen taiyaariyon main juty hui hai
 If Sanjay believes, Dhoni will be equal to half the team in the World Cup alone
 sanjay ne kaha ki dhoni adbhut vyaktitv ke maalik hai
 According to an English newspaper, Manjrekar praised Dhoni and said that he is a unique player
 manjrekar ne kaha, 'dhoni ko cricket ke itihaas se koi matlab nahin he
 If he is asked who are the last four or five captains of India, he may not be able to tell
 lekin ek khilaadi ke rup main yaa captain ke rup main unki prakruti gajab kii he
 Sanjay said that in fact in the World Cup he will prove to be equal to half the team India
 jab sanjay se 1992 kii us team se tulana karne ko kaha gaya jisane world cap khelaa tha to unhone kaha ki vartmaan team ko fielding or running ke liye behatar marks milenge
 Current players run better between wickets
 us samay kii team kabhi do ran ko teen main tabdeel nahin kar pai or ran out bahuch saamaanya si baat thi
 He jokingly said that i was ahead of it
 unhone mana ki team india world cap jeetne kii kshamta rakhti he lekin use antami overon main kam se kam ran dene ke liye gendbaajon ko prerit karnaa hoga
 Death overs are very important
 ab hamaare spinneron par iskaa daaromadar he ki ve kisi gendbaaji karte hai
 They have to take wickets in the middle overs
 virendra sahvaag kaa balla shaat maarna bhul gaya tha or sachin tendulkar ke balle se ran nahin nikal rahe tha
 This was the Newlands ground where the number one India in the world was very defensive and managed to draw the third and final Test cricket match against South Africa on Thursday
 bharat ke saamne dakshin africa sarajameen par pehali baar shrinkhalaa jitkar nayaa itihaas rachane ke liye 340 ran kaa lakshya tha lekin uske ballebaaj shuru se hi drow kii soch ke saath maidan par utre or unhone din bhar main 82 over main teen wicket par 166 ran banaakar teen maichon kii shrinkhalaa 1-1 se baraabar karwaanaa uchit samajha
 Gautam Gambhir led the Indian campaign to draw
 unhone lagbhag saadhe chaar ghante ballebaaji karke 184 gend par 64 ran banaaye
 Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 14 off 91 balls in two and a half hours while Rahul Dravid also scored 31 off 112 balls in the same time
 bharatiyon main keval vivies lakshmana (naabad 32) kaa strike rate (47
 76) was better
 dakshin africa ne 80 over baad nayi gend lee lekin keval do over ke baad donon timen match dra karaane par sahamat ho gayi
 India thus succeeded in equaling the series in South Africa for the first time
 dakshin africa ne centurian main khelaa gaya pehla test match pari or 25 ran se jeeta tha jisamen tendulkar ne 50waan shatak lagaakar itihaas rachaa tha
 India equalized the series by winning the second Test match by 87 runs with the best effort of Laxman in Durban
 ab donon tiimon ke bich ekmaatr twanti-20 or phir paanch ekadivasiy maichon kii shrinkhalaa kheli jaaegi
 Alam was that Sehwag, known for his explosive attitude, was able to score only 11 runs despite spending almost an hour at the crease and playing 40 balls
 shrinkhalaa main koi badi pari nahin khel sake sahvaag ko chotil jaak kallis kii jagah kshetrarakshan kar rahe jepi dumini ne jeevandaan bhi diya
 Sehwag could not take advantage of this and returned to the pavilion, caught by captain Graeme Smith at the first slip off Morkel's ball
 gambhir bhi newjiland ke khilaaf 2009 main wellington main apane karname ko dohraane ke mood main dikhe
 Then he avoided India's defeat by spending almost ten and a half hours at the crease
 vah bich main 31 gend tak 62 ran par atake rahe or is bich unhen do jeevandaan bhi mili
 Dravid, who got the adjective of 'indian Wall' due to his defensive batting, is accustomed to playing in such conditions and he also preferred to spend time at the crease with Gambhir
 in donon ne kabhi kabhaar hi aakraamak shaat khele or aaf stump se baahar jaati gendon ko khilne se bachate rahe
 Gambhir, who scored 93 in the first innings, completed his half-century by cutting Dale Steyn's ball to the boundary
 dakshin africa kii taraf se donon pariyon main shatak jadne vaale kallis pasli main chot ke kaaran maidan par nahin utar paye or isaliye bich main smith ne paanchaven gendbaaj kii bhoomika nibhaai
 a few balls from Harris got uneven bounce from the rough area, which also caused some problems for the batsmen
 haris ne dravid ke khilaaf pagabaadha kii vishwasaneey apil kii lekin ampire ian gould ne use thukraa diya
 From the replay it seemed that the ball was at the middle stump
 dravid (31) ko haalanki chaay ke vishram se kuch der pehle lonawabo sotsobe ne unhen out karke dakshin africa ko jaruri safalataa dilaayi
 Dravid attempted to play the short pitch ball defensively but took the edge of his bat and went into the hands of Ashwell Prince in the third slip
 gambhir abi divilliars or elviro petersan ne jeevandaan bhi diye
 Gambhir's dramatic innings finally ended by Stan whose bouncer going towards the leg side got his globs on the bat and Boucher converted it into a catch behind the wicket
 tendulkar bhi angad kii tarah paanv jamaane ke uddeshy se hi krij par utre the
 In between, he scored no runs, playing 25 and then 34 balls
 lakshmana ne haalanki is bich kuch achche shaat lagaaye jinamein sotsobe ke ek over main lagaaye gayi do chauke bhi shaamil hai
 One day a beggar gave five rupees to Arvind Kejriwal or a child gave him a donation of seven thousand rupees from a piggy bank, i often find myself very unfortunate to hear such things, because such characters are not seen around us
 
 chunavi khabaron ke bich jab pataa chalata he ki koi autowala bina paise liye falaan party kaa prachaar kar rahaa he, to man karata he pakadakar chowk ke saare autowalon ko dikhaaun ki ek wo he or ek tum jo bees rupee zyada lene ke liye bich sadak par baanh chadha lete ho
 You bribe me like cattle to charge more for two passengers
 anti main bandhe hone par bhi jab footkar teen rupee dene main autowale ko baaraha sochate dekhtaa hum, to un autowalon ko pranaam karne kaa dil karata he, jo paison kii parvaah nahin karte
 It is not that only the characters related to politics are missing from our real life
 ek hote hai rauf chachaa, jinaki mohalle main kisi se nahin banati
 Children do not even bear, because the son was killed in the riots, but every day they forget about the antics of a child in front of the writer
 ant main unki ankhen bhig jaati hai
 The child is said to be Hindu for secular tempering
 aise hi kisi roj koi aawaara jaanavar insaaniyat dikhaa jaataa he or ant main lekhak kii ankhen bhig jaati hai
 You will not believe, but in the end, if you have not written 'eyes get wet', then we do not know when the story ended
 maanav man kii gaharaaiyon se khurchan kadaachit isliye bhi na nikal paati he, kyonki asal jindagi main rauf chachaa bidi pi-pi dhuna chhod rahe hote hai, isliye bachche udhar fatakate nahin or jaanavar aajkal nagar nigam vaale uthaa lete hai
 i get overwhelmed by reading female discussions
 lekhak ke saamne kisi yuvati ko chhedaa ja rahaa hota he or wo sahasaa pratikaar kar uthati he yaa jab sab chup markar baithe hote hai, tabhi koi sayaani mahila bure ke khilaaf uth khadi hoti he
 In such stories, the next one also accepts his cowardice and even justifies the reasons by putting his hand
 shoshak ke prati aakrosh liye jab kissa nari shakti ko pranaam kar khatm hota he, to sawaal uthta he ki jab likhane vaale ne yahaan itani kalam chalaa di, to maukey par jubaan kyon na chalaa di thi? mehnat bachati or afsos bhi na rahata

 pappu yadav 2014 main madhepura se argedy kii tikat par chunaav lade or jite
 He defeated jdu's Sharad Yadav, but this time Sharad Yadav is contesting on the RJD trail and Pappu Yadav, who was expelled from the RJD, will contest on the banner of his Jan Adhikar Party

 panipat stesan par khadi is train ke ingine ke baahar pariksha dene waalon kii bheed aap dekh sakate hai
 Boys and girls both went to exams after playing on their lives
 bas main na train main paanv dharne kii jagah nahin he
 Students who took the exams also demonstrated
 patari ke aage jam laga diya
 Police had to stick sticks to remove them
 ek ek shahar main 18 se 20 hazaar chaatro ke pahunchane se bas adde se lekar pariksha kendron ke raste main bhayankar jam lag gaye
 Ambala left for Subhash's two sons Vijendra and Rajendra Kaithal to take the exam
 bike se ambala pariksha dene ja rahe the
 Both died in a road accident
 subhash kaa ghar hi ujaad gaya
 Both sons Vijendra and Rajendra died in Kaithal
 donon pariksha dene gaye the magar ambala ke liye nikle the, sadak durghatana main maare gaye
 Subhash says that the centers are kept away from the fear of copying
 kya sarkaar iskaa vikalp nahin bana sakati he
 When 15 lakh people came out on the roads, public transport system was exposed
 bason main jagah nahin mili
 Apart from the train, the condition of the buses was also bad
 chhaton par noujvaan savaar the
 There were hanging doors and windows
 media report ke anusaar indri main bas main bheed ke kaaran dam ghutane se ek noujvaan kii maut ho gai, dil kaa daura pad gaya
 There was also a strange commotion outside the examination centers

 Admit card is available on 14 September
 21, 22 or 23 sitambar ko pariksha hoti he, super fast
 What to say if other examinations start happening at this pace

 It is expected that the result will also be out and this recruitment will not prove to be an election
 is pariksha ke liye alag-alag saamaajik shrenee ke 17 saal se 42 saal ke yuvaaon ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Providing 15 lakh students from here to there in three days will not be a minor task
 jahaan jahaan pariksha ke centre pade, vahaan vahaan jam kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 ICAI students demonstrated at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India in Delhi on Monday

 yani aapane dekha ki bharat kaa chaatr na sirf pariksha karaane ke liye andolan karata he, balki pariksha kii copy kaise check ho, uske liye bhi andolan karata he
 Students have posted pictures on Twitter stating that their answer is correct but the numbers have not been found

 Our system specializes in driving people
 odisha se ek chaatr ne likhaa he ki 2017 main supplai inspector kii pariksha kaa farm niklaa, november 2018 main pariksha hui lekin sitambar 2019 main pataa hi nahin ki riselt kahaan he

 24 disambar 2016 ko police sab inspector kii bahaali nikali thi
 Its first examination was held after three years i
e
 on 8 September 2019
 na koi sarkaar dekh rahi he na koi adaalat
 Governments have left no stone unturned to harass the youth
 ab ek hi sahaara he
 Let the non-resident Indian be told that the result of the examination which the youth of India do not come even in four years
 odisha main hi sahaayak commercial tex officer kii bahaali kaa vigyaapan 2016 main aayaa tha
 She had her prelims examination in 2017
 aaj tak riselt nahin aayaa
 The main interview and appointment is still pending
 sanyukt raashtra ko bharat kii parikshaon par research karnaa chahie
 Researchers from Howard and Oxford can also conduct research on these youth of India
 kamaal kii baat he ki maheenon se dikhaane ke baad bhi sarkaar or samaaj par fark nahin pad rahaa he
 The best thing is that even the youth do not understand what is happening with them
 ye best baat he
 You will not recognize these faces
 darasal ham nahin jaanate the
 You will not digest the story of the justice in the hands of all of them, the justice of which they are talking about
 is bachche ke dada ji ek yojana ke liye visthapit hue the ab ye potaji insaaf kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 The land was taken for the Pong Dam at the time of Dadaji in 1960 and now his grandson is fighting for a rehabilitation battle in 2019
 in par nazar tab padi jab inaki taraf se hamaare daftar main saikadon patr aane lage
 All of them are from Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh
 aap yakeen nahin karenge ki ye log 50 saal se apane haq kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 Even after winning the Supreme Court, they have not got the land of rehabilitation
 yojanaon kaa elaan hota he to vikaas vikaas hota he
 People who shy away from plans are happy to see the headline
 jinaki zamin par yojana saakaar honi hoti he, unke hosh ud jate hai
 They are pushed into the shelter of lawsuits and agitations for a long time
 sabhi sarkaron ke paas dikhaane ke liye punarvaas kii tamaam nitiyaan hai lekin unke lagu hone tak itnaa lanbaa vakt guzar jaataa he ki na to press kii dilchaspee hoti he or agar aap chahen bhi to report kii kaaphi itane sawaal jawaab main ulajh jaati he ki na sawaal samaj aata he or na hi jawaab
 The common man is performing banners from time to time
 artiai se suchanaaen le rahaa hota he
 He continues to write letters from the Prime Minister to the Chief Justice
 puraa maamla aisa bana diya jaataa he ki jo visthapit hota he vahi jhootha nazar aane lagata he
 Every day, dozens of letters come from Kangra in Himachal Pradesh
 saare patr tip kiye hue hai
 Below is the name of the sender, signature
 patr bhejne vaale bataate hai ki ve himachal pradesh ke pong baandh ke visthapit kisaan hai or 50 saal se punarvaas ke liye ke liye sangharsh kar rahe hai
 50 years have passed
 kahaan kya chook hui yahi check karne chaliye to maheenon nikal jaaenge
 According to what he has said in his letter, when the dam was built on Pong for Rajasthan's need, the fertile land of Kangra district sank
 jisamen 339 gaanv dub gaye or dedh lakh log beghar ho gaye
 In 1970, there was agreement between the Chief Ministers of Punjab, Himachal and Rajasthan that each displaced would be given more than 15 acres of land
 iske liye sriganganagar main 2
 20 lakh acres of land were extracted
 magar indira nahar kaa pani pahunchane ke baad pong ke visthapiton ko sarkaar bhul gai
 The land mafias took fake documents and got the land of the displaced farmers in their names and the farmers got nothing
 iske baad kisaan 1996 main supreme court gaye
 The peasants won from the Supreme Court, and the court made complete arrangements to give land, formed a committee, decided the committee members
 1996 se 2019 tak hai power cameti 24 saal main sirf 24 baithken kar pai
 The fertile land of Sriganganagar was not given the sandy, barren land in Jaisalmer and Bikaner
 jahaan na bijli he, na pani he na sadak na skool
 Then the same High Power Committee wrote in October 2017 that this land is not cultivable
 us zamin ke aavanton ko cancel kar kaha ki nai zamin di jaae
 For 48 years these committees have been entangled in the committee but no land was found
 yah patr mere paas zarur aayaa he magar sambodhit he bharat ke pradhanmantri shri narendra modi ko
 It takes 50 years of rehabilitation
 yah haal he insaaf he, system kaa
 In this letter, the farmers have given their phone number, village address
 jo likh sakate hai mushkil se apana naam likh paae hai or jo dastakhat nahin kar sakate hai vahaan apana angootha chhap lagaaya he
 Today's press does not know how to cover such problems
 lihaaza log patr likh rahe hai
 Guess the mental problems of these farmers of Kangra
 wo cameti cameti, court court karte karte 50 saal main kitna tut gaye honge
 This is our system
 darasal bharat main sab thik hone kaa yahi matlab ho gaya he
 Everything has to be done as it is
 50 saal pehle jab visthaapan hua tha tab 17000 parivaar the lekin ab unka parivaar bada ho gaya he jo 35-40 hazaar ho gaye hai
 The third generation of farmers is fighting for the right
 duusari taraf hai power cameti main in 24-30 saalon main itane kagaz patr jamaa ho gaye honge, kitne adhikari aakar chale gaye honge ki inke jawaab kaa koi matlab nahin hota he
 After all, we are not able to rehabilitate these farmers in 50 years
 prashasan jaanata he ki patrkaar bhi ulajh kar chhod degaa lekin logon kii ladaai kaa dhiraj dekhie, wo 50 saal se apni zamin or haq kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 After coming to the media, who has made a difference that 178 villages of Madhya Pradesh were drowned when the water started filling in the Sardar Sarovar Dam
 pani bhar rahaa tha gujarat main, gaanv dub rahe the madhya pradesh main
 The Chief Minister completes the formalities of writing the letter, but the sinking of the villages is not stopped
 dhar main khaparakheda main ranjana heeralaal gore ke ghar main pani bhar aayaa
 Ranjana did not want to leave her house
 kisi tarah nikaala gaya lekin unka ghar dub gaya
 The family says that rehabilitation grants have not yet been received, where to go
 chikhalda main vaahid bhi bikhar gaye
 The house courtyard was drowned while watching
 yahaan medha patkar lard bhi rahi hai lekin sochie kangra ke kisaanon ke liye to koi ladane vaala bhi nahin he
 The media knows Medha Patkar but still does not do the formalities of writing to show their fight
 kuch hisson main unke andolan kii khabar aa jaati he lekin 170 se adhik gaanv dub gaye kisi ko fark nahin padaa
 When Praveen's house was submerged, he jumped into Narmada itself
 kisi tarah navikon ne use bachaa liya
 Common people could not understand their lives or cattle or their home or village
 punarvaas kaa daawa sarkaar kaa kuch hota he, kisaan kii baaten kuch or hoti hai
 Anurag Dwari had recently shown a detailed report on this
 aap jo dekh rahe hai wo kangra ke pong baandh ke prabhavit kisaan pichley 50 saalon se dekh rahe hai
 They did not get rehabilitation land
 50 saal se kangra ke kisaan apane punarvaas kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 The story of the Narmada displaced is now getting tired in the media too, but those who have lost their land, whose houses are submerged, how can they forget their villages and homes

 Congress president Rahul Gandhi himself is holding rallies in Karnataka
 saath hi mangalvaar ko sonia gandhi bhi chunaav prachaar main utarane ja rahi hai
 On Tuesday, where Rahul Gandhi attacked PM Modi and BJP on the one hand, on the other hand he made many promises to the people
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki congress agle paanch saal main 50 lakh ghar banaakar degi
 PM Modi promised employment, which he broke
 padhie unke bhaashan kii mukhya baaten
 Millions of people got employment in Karnataka
 karnataka rojgaar dene ke maamalon main baaki rajyon se sabase aage he
 If our government comes, it will give employment to one crore people in the next five years
 karnataka ke kone-kone main pani pahonchega
 We will give 33 percent reservation in government jobs to women
 basavanna ne kaha tha, jo kehete ho karo
 The BJP president came here, promising that he would increase the MSP
 wo kisaanon kii baat karte hai, lekin madad karne kaa samay aata he to unke shabd khokhale hote hai
 The BJP has raised the issue of increasing MSP in the Lok Sabha
 aapako 450 karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua, lekin unhone aapako 5 karod rupee bhi nahin die
 i am happy that for the first time the Government of Karnataka has started online trading
 vah bhi tiptur main
 In the election you have to choose whether you want the CM of the poor or the corrupt CM
 kya aap garibon, kamajoro kii madad karne vaali congress party ko chunanaa chaahate hai yaa chaar-paanch logon ko bhrashtachar karne kii ijaajat dene vaali bijepi ko chunanaa chaahate hai?is baar congress ke kaaryakarta ekasaath khadey hue hai
 There is an ideological battle going on here, Congress on one side, BJP on one side and JDS on the other
 is ladaai main bich main khadaa nahin hua ja saktaa he
 The name Janata Dal Secular (JDS) has the word s secular, but the question arising in Karnataka is whether s means secular or Sangh parivar? They should directly say, in which side they are - in the public side of Karnataka, in the RSS-BJP side
 chunaavon main congress kii jeet hogi or vikaas hoga
 Our activists fight for our ideology
 vahiin, bijepi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi chunaav prachaar main utaara he
 On Tuesday, PM Modi, while addressing a public meeting in Koppal, Karnataka, targeted the Congress fiercely
 unhone kaha ki bijepi rashtrabhakti or samajaseva main bharosa karti he, jabaki congress sirf parivaar ke liye kaam karti he
 The Assembly elections in Gujarat have now become a tough challenge for the central government
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke home state main bijepi kii saakh bachaana or vipaksh main baithe rahul gandhi kii congress ko front par laane kii kavayad ke bich kendra main modi sarkaar aisa koi risk lenaa nahin chaahati jisase gujarat ke chunaavon main baaji ulti pad jaae
 This is the reason why the central government is scared due to elections in the state
 kendra sarkaar par sawaal yun hi nahin uth rahe
 Political reasons are also being given behind these questions that have arisen in political circles
 pehla sawaal: modi sarkaar ne kyon roka jidipi kaa taaja aankada?state bank of india apane research main daawa kar chuki he ki vitt varsh 2017-18 kii duusari timahi (july-sitambar) main sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) 6 fisadi se neeche rahane ke asaar hai
 During the first quarter (april-june) of the current fiscal, the GDP figures are at a three-year low of 5
 7 fisadi par pahunch gai thi
 The decline is attributed to the demonetisation of the country's economy first by the central government and then by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to domestic businesses from 1 July
 haalanki esbiai research ke mutabik giravat kaa yah silsilaa chaalu vitt varsh kii teesri or chauthi timahi ke dauraan 6
 Will come to a halt at 5 percent
 lekin duusari timahi ke aankadon ke saamne sabase badi chunauti gujarat main voting kii he
 Rahul Gandhi has left no stone unturned to make the central government's manipulation of the economy an issue to move the BJP into Narendra Modi's stronghold
 apni baat ko gujarat kii janata ke bich rakhane ke liye congress ne purv- vitt mantri pi chidambaram or purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh samet party se jude sabhi chode-bade arthshaastriyon kii madad lee he
 ALSO READ: The scare of inflation, the Sakpakai Modi government introduced restrictions on import-export, and following the initiative of Congress leader Anand Sharma in political corridors, the question is that the central government is messing with the economic data in the wake of elections
 use dar he ki kahin duusari timahi ke aane vaale aankaden congress ke hamale ko bal na de den or unhen chunaavon main munh kii khaani pade
 It is to be noted that generally the second quarter GDP figures should have been released by 1 November
 doosraa sawaal: modi sarkaar ne taala sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr?sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr aamtaur par november ke tisare hafte main shuru ho jaataa he
 But in view of the Gujarat Assembly elections in December, this important session of Parliament has been postponed for the present
 aisa kendra sarkaar or sansad sachivalay main sutron kaa daawa he
 According to sources, the winter session of Parliament has been postponed keeping in mind the last date for campaigning in Gujarat elections
 aamtaur par deepawali ke aasapaas cabinet cameti on political afares sheetakaaleen satr kii taarikh nirdhaarit kar detii he, lekin deepawali ko beete ek maheene se upar samay bich chukaa he or is aashay kendriya cabinet kii baithak nahin bulaai gai he
 Sources claim that now the winter session will be announced after the end of campaigning in Gujarat elections
 ise bhi padhein: khatm hui crude oil keemton kii aitihaasik raahat, ab dastak degi mahangaai!teesraa sawaal: film padmavati vivaad par kyon chup he sarkaar?beete ek hafte se zyada samay se nirmaataa-nirdeshak sanjay lila bhansaali kii film vivaadon main ghiri he
 There have been indications of postponing the release of the film till the campaigning for the Gujarat elections
 abhi tak jahaan karani sena ne sanjay lila bhansaali par hamalaa karne se lekar film kii abhinetri deepika padukon kii naak kaatane kii dhamkee tak de diya he
 BJP mps, mlas and leaders from across the country have been vocal against the film
 darasal mana ja rahaa he ki film main rani padmavati or allaudin khilji ke bich darshaae gaye prem par desh bhar se rajput pariwaron ne aapatti uthaai he
 These people believe that history is being misrepresented in the film 
 in sab ke bich kendra sarkaar ne philhal puure maamle main chuppi saadh rakhi he
 At the same time, top BJP leaders believe that the film depicts the Kshatriya royal family of Rajasthan incorrectly
 khaas baat yah he ki film ke virodh main bijepi ke saath-saath congress netaaon ne bhi apana sur alapa he
 It is now believed in political circles that the ruling party as well as the opposition party is standing on this disputed film
 lihaaja sambhaavna he ki is film ko bhi gujarat main chunaavon se pehle relies nahin kiya jayega

 The Modi government's intention is to popularize helicopter services especially in Delhi NCR and reduce pressure from Indira Gandhi Airport, which is why the government is also giving subsidy on fares

 The BJP had lodged a complaint on one of his statements on Saturday
 is bich dilli ke narela vidhansabha main ek chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue vishwaas ne bijepi netaaon kii jamkar khilli udayi

 kumaar vishwaas yahaan apane kavi avatar main dikhe
 He lashed out at all BJP leaders
 vishwaas ne kavi sammelan kaa maahaul banaate hue logon ko us press conference kii yaad dilaai, jisamen kiran bedi ko bijepi main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 He said, 'after seeing the press conference, seeing the face of Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay, it seemed as if the groom stitched the coat but the mare ran away
 wo yahi nahin ruke
 He said about Harshvardhan that Harsha was missing from Harshvardhan's face
 jagadish mukhi us vakt jagadish dukhi dikhaai de rahe the
 When Vishwas called BJP an army of kali, he called himself and Kejriwal as Sholay's jai-veeru

 He fiercely copied Modi
 vishwaas ne kaha jab bijepi ko apni party main koi eemaandaar vyakti nahin mila to hamaari team se le gaye or unhen CM kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya

 Taking a dig at the media too, Vishwas said, "they have come here so that i can say something and play it on TV in the evening, then slipped tongue
" ' unhone kaha, 'obama kii yatra main kejariwal ko nyotaa isliye nahin mila kyonki bijepi vaale dar gaye the
 He was afraid Obama would not join hands with Kejriwal

 aspx raajnneeti kii disha tay karne main bayaanbaji kii ahm bhoomika hoti he
 Now take Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed
 unhone bangalore main bijepi daftar ke baahar hue blast par aisa bayaan de daalaa he jo unki hi party ke liye gale kii fans ban gaya
 Bangalore blast will benefit BJP: Shakeel Ahmed Within a few hours of the blast in Bangalore, Shakeel Ahmed tweeted that this blast can benefit BJP
 bayaan saamne aate hi shakeel ahamed kii chautarafa aalochana hone lagi
 When the Congress rebuffed this statement, BJP termed it as irresponsible
 congress mahasachiv janardan dvivedi ne to unhen aatankwaad par raajnneeti na karne kii naseehat tak de daali
 Bangalore BLAST: 'political' war started with statements, Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed tweeted, 'if the blast outside the BJP office is a terrorist attack, then BJP will definitely get its electoral advantage
 'shakeel ahamed ke is bayaan par bijepi netaa shahanvaj hossain ne tikhi tippanee kii
 Shahnawaz Hussain said, 'congress leaders should not make such irresponsible statements
 main congress se puuchhuunga ki kya isse pehle hue bam blast kaa congress ko phayda hua he
 Minister of State for Home RPN Singh distanced himself from Shakeel Ahmed's controversial statement, saying, "this may be his personal opinion
" congress aise muddon par raajnneeti nahin karti he
 'congress general secretary Janardan Dwivedi also pulled Shakeel Ahmed in gestures
 unhone kaha ki aatankwaad par siyasat naa ho
 CPI leader d Raja called Shakeel Ahmed's tweet inappropriate and absurd
 unhone kaha ki blast kii jaanch NIA ko karne den, is tarah kii bayaanbaji nahin hona chahie
 Now the question arises whether Shakeel Ahmed will also have to bear the brunt for this? 'bahubali : da bigning' kii lokapriyata itani faili he ki darshak iske mukhya kirdaar 'bahubali' yani prabhas ke har kadam par najar banaae hue hai
 Presently, Prabhas is sweating heavily for the sequel of this film 'bahubali: The Conclusions'
 unhone chaar maah tak ji-tod mehnat kii or purna rup se apane 'diet chart' kaa paalan kar rahe hai
 For this, Prabhas is strictly forbidden to eat junk food, sweet and ice cream, but if it is about ice cream, it is difficult to stop 'bahubali'
 tippaniyan In such a situation, the question that has been going on for the last one year, why Katappa killed Bahubali? Perhaps the jokers on this answer should say that Bahubali was insisting on eating ice cream, so Katappa killed him
 prabhas se jude sutron ne bataaya ki abhinayta ko icecream behad pasand he or unka pasandida flavor 'fruit exotica' he, jise vah sakht hidaayat ke baavjood bhi kabhi-kabhaar kha hi lete hai
 Bahubali is capricious and hence the film's director S
 rajamauli bhi naaraaz nahin hote
 He worked hard for four months and is following his 'diet chart' completely
 iske liye prabhas ko junk food, meetha or icecream khaanaa sakht manaa he, lekin agar baat icecream kii ho, to 'bahubali' ko rokna mushkil he
 The comments aise main pichley ek saal se chal rahe sawaal ki katappa ne bahubali ko kyon maaraa? kaa jawaab bhi shaayad is par joke banane vaale yah kahkar den ki bahubali iscream khaane kii jid kar rahaa tha, isliye katappa ne use maar diya
 Sources associated with Prabhas said that the actor loves ice cream and his favorite flavor is 'fruit Exotica', which he rarely consumes despite strict instructions
 bahubali manamaujee he or isliye is baat par film ke nirdeshak es
 Rajamouli also does not get angry
