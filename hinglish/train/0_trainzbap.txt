 In the same photo you can also see that Michelle Obama has an angry face
 maano ve apane pati ko rokna chaah rahi hon lekin bade-bade logon kii maujuudagi main roak na paa rahi hon
 In this second picture you can see that Barack Obama and Hale Thorning are in a very light mood and laughing at something
 obama haile ke kandhe par haath rakhkar kuch kah rahe hai or misses obama udhaas hai
 In such a situation, we remember a song, "in Madhuban, which Kanha met a gopi

 ab ye antim tasviir puri kahani saaf kar detii he
 Halle Thorning and Barack Obama previously sat together, but now Michelle Obama is in the middle

 Dravid delayed his stroke play on the ball he was pitching on his leg stump and got caught in the wickets with his pad
 tendulkar ne jab krij par kadam rakhaa to phir se darshakon ne khadey hokar unka abhivadan kiya
 He made two amazing shots of his drive in front of Siddle, hitting fours but India lost the wickets of Tendulkar and Gambhir within six balls just before lunch

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni contributed immensely in getting the Indian cricket team to where Indian cricket lovers always wanted to see him
 
 
 dhoni ke netritv main hi team india varsh 2009 main test cricket main number ek ke darje tak pahunchi
 
 
 Under Dhoni's captaincy, the team won the first T20 International World Cup in 2007, beating arch-rivals Pakistan in the final
 
 
 us samay bhi dhoni hi captain the, jab bhartiya team ne varsh 2013 main champions trophy apane naam kii
 
 
 And Dhoni was still in command of the team when India won the 50-over format World Cup in the year 2011
 
 
 so, is tarah mahendra singh dhoni duniya ke ekmaatr captain hai, jinhone apni team ko antarrashtriya cricket parishad dwaara yojit teenon bade toornamenton main khitaab dilvaaya

 vah teenon format (test, van-de, tii-20) main milakar sabase zyaada maichon main captaini karne vaale khilaadi hai
 
 
 Dhoni has captained a total of 324 matches played for Asia and India, and topped that figure with Australia's Ricky Ponting
 
 
 dhoni ne inamen se 175 match jite hai, or 117 main unhen haar naseeb hui
 
 
 Wicket-keeper batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni, popularly known as 'mr
 Finisher', has a world record for most stumpings, and in 510 innings of 439 matches, he amassed the gills of 148 players who went beyond the crease to hit the ball
 Had left 
 
 vaise, wicketiper ke rup main puure antarrashtriya kariyar main sabase zyaada shikaar karne waalon kii suchi main mahendra singh dhoni tisare sthaan par hai
 
 
 Top of this list is South African wicketkeeper batsman Mark Boucher, who scored a total of 998 victims in 596 innings of 467 matches with 952 catches and 46 stumpings
 
 
 unka prati pari shikaar karne kaa ausat 1
 674 remained
 
 
 suchi main duusare number par hai australian diggaj adam gilcrist, jinhone sirf 396 maichon kii 485 pariyon main 813 kaich or 92 stamping ke saath kul 905 shikaar kiye
 
 
 Gilchrist averages 1 victim per innings
 865 rahaa
 
 
 Dhoni, ranked third in the list, has 705 victims in 510 innings of 439 matches with 557 catches and 148 stumpings, averaging 1 per innings
 382 rahaa
 
 
 Dhoni is fourth in the list of most catches behind wickets
 
 
 yahaan bhi sabase upar mark bouchar hai, duusare number par adam gilcrist or tisare number par hai australia ke hi ian hili, jinhone 287 maichon kii 392 pariyon main 560 kaich or 68 stamping ke saath kul 628 shikaar kiye, or unka prati pari shikaar ausat 1
 602 remained
 
 
 is suchi main mahendra singh dhoni chauthe paaydaan par hai
 
 
 a very interesting aspect of Dhoni's career is his recognition as 'the Best Finisher'
 
 
 ve middle order main ballebaaji karne aate hai, jisase salaami ballebaajon kii tarah unke paas bahut bade-bade score banane ke maukey tulanaatmak rup se kam hote hai, lekin iske baavjood teenon format main kul milakar unka ballebaaji ausat 44
 Is 77
 
 
 ab isaki vajah yah he ki vah bahut baar note out rahakar pavilion lautate hai
 
 
 So, in this list, he is second after Sri Lankan bowler Muttiah Muralitharan
 
 
 muralidharan kul milakar 119 baar naabad rahe hai, jabaki dhoni 115 baar bina wicket ganvaae pavilion laute hai
 
 
 He is the captain of most matches in all three formats (test, one-day, T20)
 
 
 dhoni ne asia or bharat ke liye khele kul 324 maichon main captaini kii he, or is aankade ke liye vah australia ke riki ponting ke saath sanyukt rup se sheersh par hai
 
 
 Dhoni has won 175 of these matches, and lost them in 117 matches
 
 
 'mistar finishr' ke naam se mashhoor wicketiper ballebaaj mahendra singh dhoni ne sarvaadhik stamping kaa vishwa record apane naam darj karavaaya he, or kul 439 maichon kii 510 pariyon main unhone 148 aise khilaadiyon kii gilliyaan bikherin, jo gend ko maarane ke liye kries se aage nikal gaye the
 
 
 By the way, Mahendra Singh Dhoni is third in the list of most hunters in the entire international career as a wicketkeeper
 
 
 is list main sabase upar dakshin africa wicketiper ballebaaj mark bouchar hai, jinhone 467 maichon kii 596 pariyon main 952 kaich or 46 stamping ke saath kul 998 shikaar banaae
 
 
 He averaged 1 hunting per inning
 674 rahaa
 
 
 Second on the list is Australian veteran Adam Gilchrist, who totaled 905 with 813 catches and 92 stumpings in 485 innings of just 396 matches
 
 
 gilcrist kaa prati pari shikaar ausat 1
 865 remained
 
 
 list main tisare number par darj dhoni ne kul 439 maichon kii 510 pariyon main 557 kaich or 148 stamping ke saath 705 shikaar kiye, jinka prati pari ausat 1

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni is at number four in this list
 
 
 dhoni ke kariyar kaa ek behad rochak pahalu he 'da best finishr' ke rup main unki pahchaan
 
 
 He comes to bat in the middle order, which, like the openers, has comparatively few chances of scoring big scores, but despite this he has a batting average of 44 overall in all three formats
 77 he
 
 
 Now the reason is that he returns to the pavilion after not being out too many times
 
 
 so, is suchi main vah srilanka ke dhurandhar gendbaaj muthaiya muralidharan ke baad duusare sthaan par hai
 
 
 Muralitharan has been unbeaten 119 times in total, while Dhoni has returned to the pavilion 115 times without losing wickets

 duniya bhar main whatsapp ke yugers kii sankhya 1
 Is more than 5 billion
 inamen se zyaadaatar yugers bharat main hai
 For some time, the Indian government has been continuously asking whatsapp to bring a tool to trace the message, but whatsapp has taken a tough stand about it
 ab ek baar phir se aisi hi report aa rahi he
 According to an ET report, the government has asked whatsapp to do digital fingerprinting to trace the origin of all the messages sent
 ET kii is report main do senior oficial ko kot kiya gaya he
 He has said that whatsapp should know what is the origin of the message and how many people have read it
 gauratlab he ki iske do pahalu hai
 The first is that digital fingerprinting does not mean that your messages will be readable, as this does not interfere with message encryption
 ET ke mutabik senior oficial ne kaha he ki whatsapp massej ke fingerprinting se massej ke originetter kaa pataa chal sakegaa or sarkaar yahi chaahati he
 However, it has also been said in this report that the government does not want to read a user's message, but when a problem is seen, it can be traced together with whatsapp
 sarkaar kii taraf se oficial ne ye bhi kaha he ki yah sambhav he or whatsapp ko tarika dhundhna hi hoga
 The ET report quotes another government official saying, "it is not acceptable that no one can trace the message
" kisi ne kisi ko kabhi massej tres karnaa chahie
 We have reached a limit of anonymity on the internet and it has to go now 'whatsapp has not released any statement on this development though
 lekin isse pehle kai baar whatsapp ye saaf kar chukaa he ki company ke liye kisi massej ke origin ko tres yaa trek karnaa asambhav he
 Since whatsapp is a platform with end to end encryption, whatsapp also does not have the ability to read or trace anyone's message
 whatsapp ke ek ejeeniyar jab bharat aae the to bhi unhone kaha tha ki agar whatsapp main kisi massej ko tres yaa trek karne kaa tul aata he to whatsapp kii pahchaan hi mit jaaegi
 whatsapp is known as a private messaging app and this is its identity
 aapako bataa den ki whatsapp yujar kaa data store nahin karata he
 But if the company accepts the digital fingerprints suggested by India, then it has to store user data and for this, whatsapp will have to make major changes
 lekin abhi tak aisa lagata nahin he ki whatsapp sarkaar ke is suzav ko maanane ke mood main he, kyonki haal hi main privesi ko lekar fasebuk kii aalochana hui he or is kadam se ek baar phir se fasebuk privesi exparts or privesi pansad karne waalon ke nishane par aa jayega

 Please tell that Sonakshi will also be seen in Akshay Kumar's film Mission Mangal

 What's with # teamindia's new training drill? 🤔🤔pic
 twitter
 com / 4z04dovrii— BCCI (@BCCI) December 4, 2019 Interestingly, many times the players who were running in the first line used to hang a handkerchief behind them and the aim of the team running back was to chase them and drop it
 
 bataaya jaataa he ki bhartiya team ke nae strength or condishning (trainer) coach nik web yah drill lekar aae hai
 This will not only speed up the pace of the players, but it will also pressure that someone is chasing them at full speed
 nik web newjiland mahila cricket or aaisland sthit rugby lig kii team warirs ke purv trainer rah chuke hai
 a senior IPL trainer told PTI, "players are either chasing someone or someone is chasing them, this gives a motivation to run fast

 'there has been a lot of change in the practice of the Indian team since the time of Shankar Basu, there is an effort to make it interesting
 cancer
 On hearing this word, the vibrations of those people start trembling, who are health conscious or in their case are a bit too grown up
 hamamen se harek ne kabhi na kabhi kisi jaankaar ko is khaufnak samajhi jane vaali beemaari se jujhate dekha hoga or durbhaagya se hamamen se zyaadaatar ko dukhad anubhav bhi hua hoga
 But is cancer really as dangerous as it is understood or are we responsible for the traumatic experience of cancer that we have made this dreadful disease a big boob
 chaahe koi beemaari ho yaa jindagi ke kisi bhi kaam main koi buraai yaa galati ho, uski bahut zyada upeksha kii jaae, to vah kahin bhi khatarnaak ho sakati he—phir baat chaahe insaani sharir kii ho, kisi sanghathan ke kaamkaaj kii yaa koi project develop karne kii
 There is no need to fear cancer too much
 agar ham apni maujuuda jaankaree ko dekhen to cancer ke 90 pratishat se zyada marijon kaa fasrt stage main ilaaj ho saktaa he
 This ratio is about 70 percent in the second stage, 40 percent in the third stage and less than 10 percent in the fourth stage
 aajkal kai tarah ke cancer ko gambhir lekin kaabo main aane laayak beemaari mana jaataa he jinhen cancer ke alaava kisi bhi duusare gambhir rogon kii tarah dawaaon se kai saal tak kaabo main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 It has often been observed that more than one third of cancers are attributable to consumption of tobacco or products made from it, while one third are related to food and lifestyle or other social factors
 isliye duniyabar main vibhinn bhugolic sthitiyon main kaisar ke swaroop or failaav main bhinnata najar aati he
 The main reason for this is due to factors like local consumption of tobacco, food habits and socio-economic and living conditions
 in karkon kii vajah se hamaare desh main is samay dikhaai de rahaa adhiktar cancer aasaani se dikhne vaali jagahon par yaa anguli kii pahunch ke bheetar hota he
 But sadly, despite the inherent benefits of being diagnosed early, more than 80 percent of cancer patients in our country come to the third and fourth stage for treatment, and by this time most cases are incurable
 
 uski vajah se hi ye yah bhranti failati he ki cancer laailaaj he
 Our country is so depressed in terms of cancer due to some reasons such as general ignorance or lack of information, illiteracy, poor socio-economic conditions and acute shortage of facilities both for the quality and quantity of cancer diagnosis and treatment
 use badalane ke liye drudh rajnatik or prashasnic sankalp kii jarurat he
 Going through the ups and downs of life and during different circumstances in the last nearly 35 years, whenever people came to know about my profession, first of all, some common questions have been flying in the air, like - what is cancer? Is it contagious? It is necessary to state here that cancer is not an infectious disease, and eating, sleeping or drinking with a cancer patient does not spread this disease
 kai log ise khandaani beemaari maanate hai
 But there are some cancer diseases that can be seen in various members due to family history, eating habits or other reasons
 inamen colon cancer he jo khan-paan kii aadaton se hota he
 Breast cancer can occur due to genetic reasons in mother and daughter
 sirf 5 fisadi cancer janetic hote hai
 Cancer is an uncontrolled, irregular and abnormal growth of cells that can begin from any part of the body, tissue or organ, perhaps for some known or or hitherto unknown reason
 yah shuruaati kaaran khatm ho jane ke baad bhi jari rah sakati he, jisaki pravriti aas-paas ke saamaanya utakon main ghuspaith karne or raktavahikaaon main ghus jane kii he, jisase yah rog fefdon, liver, dimag or haddiyon jaise kuch angon yaa puure sharir ke hisson main fail jaataa he
 This is called metastasis
 agar ilaaj na ho to aakhirkaar rogi kii maut ho jaati he
 The cause of cancer in India is somewhat different from developing countries
 inamen garibi, ashiksha, kuposhan, kam umr main vivaah, baar-baar garbhvatee hona, gandagi or sehat ko lekar andekhi jaise kaaran pramukh hai
 Not only this, about one-third of the cases related to cancer are due to tobacco and one-third are due to food habits
 global iconomi kii baat karen to isamen vikasshil deshon kaa paanch fisadi hissaa he jabaki cancer ke do-tihaai maamle inhen deshon main hote hai
 Most of these cases account for 80 per cent of the cases in the third or fourth stage, whereas in developed countries the opposite is true
 yah koi nayaa rog nahin he
 The mention of the true form of cancer in modern science began some 150 years ago
 lekin pichley kuch samay se vibhinn kaarnon or karkon kii vajah se cancer ke rogiyon kii nirantar badhati sankhya ke kaaran is par adhik dhyaan jane laga he
 In this life filled with modern lifestyle and stress and running around, we need to spend some time for our health
 nahin to sankat sir par he

 Some mlas complained about the attitude of Sehrawat to the party leadership
 philhal puraa maamla anushaasan samiti ko bhej diya gaya or jaanch hone tak vidhayak devendra saharaavat suspend rahenge
 AAP mlas were accused of exploitation of women, one after another on Twitter after the sex CD of former Delhi government minister Sandeep Kumar surfaced on Twitter
 haal hi main saharaavat ne mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko chitthee likhakar aarope lagaaya tha ki party ke bade netaa mahilaon kaa shoshan kar rahe hai
 However, he could not prove the accusation of his own charge

 Simultaneously, by referring to a girl, he was repeatedly raising party leaders and Kejriwal in the dock of questions
 aarope lagane kaa ye khel lambey vakt tak nahin chalaa or party ne unhen suspend kar diya
 Now Sehrawat will openly attack Kejriwal
 It is clear that Sehrawat will now openly attack party leaders
 lekin kya wo khud ko bachaane ke liye saboot saamne rakh paaenge, ye bada sawaal he
 Shortly after being suspended, Sehrawat wrote on Twitter in his own style that if you have courage, then leave me out of the party
 67 vidhayak hone ke baavjood aam aadmi party kaam karke nahin dikhaa pai

 It is opening like a circle of wool
 khatm hone ke naam hi nahin le rahaa he
 The new revelation has been that there were about 40 call girls in this syndicate of Honey Trap
 jinamein bollywood kii kuch heroinon ke naam bhi saamne aa rahe hai
 Who not only went close to the leaders and officers but also made a video of them in a very vicious manner
 inaki duusari team ne unheen pikcharon ko apane shikaar se paise anthne or unase sarkari kaam nikalwane kaa zariyaa bana liya
 The game of Sura, Sundari and politics Sura and Sundari have always dominated the state

 Those hunter beauties were just waiting for this
 empi main jinka racket pehle bade logon tak pahunchataa tha
 He was then intoxicated with alcohol and used to increase his attachment with him
 phir usee andaaz main unhen blackmel karne ke liye filmein banaai jaati thim
 The tip of this biggest sex scandal of MP, held by the ATS and the police, is opening with each passing day
 magar uski thaah kahaan tak he iskaa andaaza kisi ko nahin lag rahaa he
 Names of b grade heroines also revealed: The next sensational revelation in this Honey Trap scandal is that this blackmailing syndicate had more than 40 call girls
 or iske taar sirf empi main hi nahin faile hue hai
 Rather, it has also included Bollywood B-grade heroines
 or khabar mil rahi he ki in heroinon ne siyasat ke bade bade diggajon kii nabz ko daboch rakhaa he
 It is not only politics but also high bureaucrats
 police in daavon kii pushti to nahin kar rahi he, magar camera band hote hi is tarah kii baaten aa rahi hai
 It is possible that soon the names of some heroines may also come up in this case
 or ye saaf ho jaae ki parde ke peeche se aakhir ye syndicate chalaa koun rahaa he
 Such victims would have become leaders-officers It is important to understand the modus operandi of the beauties involved in this honey trap scandal, which has brought shock in the politics of MP
 kyonki isi main is sindicket kaa raaj bhi chupa he or baakiyon ke liye sabak bhi
 The beauties that reach the rooms of the topmost people of politics and bureaucracy can not only be beautiful but they also had to be smart
 ye apane shikaar ko jaal main fansaane main puri ehtiyaat baratati thim
 They had fake ids to stay in hotels
 ye khulaasa to khud police bhi kar chuki he

 Room was also taken in the hotel to trap him
 us kamare main harbhajan singh ke aane se pehle ek hasina ne bina sim ke ai-phone ko teble par rakh diya tha
 So that it looks as if it has been mounted on charging
 or chupake se uskaa video mod on kar diya gaya tha
 Then she recorded everything she wanted to do
 police ko ab tak aise kai video mil chuke hai
 On one hand, police investigation is investigating the Honey Trap case
 to vahiin duusari taraf iskar vibhaag bhi is maamle main karodon rupee ke len-dein kii baat saamne aane ke baad ankhen gadaaye hue he
 Therefore, the old records and transactions of the women caught are also being investigated
 bijepi kii netaa he ek hasinapulice ko in blackmailer hasinaaon ke paas se ek do nahin balki puure 90 aise video mili hai
 There are records of dirty things ranging from political donations to bureaucrats
 iske alaava in shikari mahilaon ke paas se 8 sim cards bhi mili hai
 Whose record is being scrutinized
 police ko jaanch main ye bhi pataa chalaa he ki hanitrap cond main pakadi gai ek hasina to bijepi ke shasankaal main kishor nyaayalay board kii sadsy or bal kalyaan samiti kii sadsy bhi rah chuki he
 Many big names can be revealed right now, this is just the beginning
 police ko puraa yakeen he ki is syndicate main sirf itani hi hasinaayen nahin hai
 Rather, the beauties can have full access
 mumkin he ki ye empi kii rahane vaali bhi naa hon
 From time to time, they have been brought to other big cities of Bhopal, Indore and MP
 or wo apana kaam karne ke nikal jaati hon
 The phone numbers of some other beauties have also been found by the police

 kitaab:kalidas: FOR THE 21st CENTURY readersprakasaka:aleph BOOK companyamgreji anuwaad:mani ravakimat:399rupejab-jab bhartiya sahitya kii charchaa hoti he, kavita, naatak or isamen prayog kiye gaye upama-upmey kaa zikr hota he, tab-tab kalidas jarur yaad kiye jate hai
 Not only Sanskrit, even when praising and evaluating the composition of a foreign language, Indians still remember Kalidas
 yah alag baat he ki kalidas kii rachanaaon ko padhane, jaanane-samajhane kaa avasar har kisi ko nahin mila hota he
 The biggest obstacle to this is the lack of understanding and knowledge of Sanskrit language
 itnaa hi nahin, kai baar kalidas kii rachanaaon ke hindi anuwaad bhi aise jatil hote hai, jo nai peedi ke palle aasaani se nahin padate
 The author has tried to overcome this deficiency by presenting an English translation of Kalidasa's compositions
 kitaab main kalidas kii kaaljayi kavitaaon or naatakon kaa angreji anuwaad karke rochak tareeke se pesh kiya gaya he
 There remains merit in the translation, so many of the corresponding words are simply written in Roman script
 sanskrit ke shabdon kaa uccharan sahi tareeke se ho, iske liye ek alag pej par nirdesh die gaye hai
 Overall, this book is suitable for the English-born generation
 is lihaaj se kitaab apane naam ko sarthak hi karti he
 The works of Kalidasa which have been included in this book are 'meghdootam', 'abhigyan Shakuntalam', 'ritusamandham', 'raghuvansham', 'kumarasambhavaam', 'malavikaganamimitram', 'vikramorvashiyam'
 kai baar to yah kitaab kalidas kii moulik rachana ko bhi padhane kii ichha jagaa detii he
 See some lines of 'meghdootam'

 The price of a book can definitely change

 Sunil Gavaskar said in a special conversation with NDTV India that there is no need to take the Australian media seriously questioning the Ranchi pitch
 australian media apni team ke liye saport staff kii tarah he
 Like the Australian team has physio, trainer, messenger etc
 usee tarah se australian media bhi unke liye hi kaam karti he
 
 unhen gambhirtha se lene kii jarurat nahin
 Gavaskar said that finger is always raised on Indian and subcontinent pitches
 
 But when these teams go abroad and the ball swings and seams with the first ball then there is no question
 
 In the ICC rating, Pune's pitch was rated as Poor and Bengaluru's pitch got below average rating
 
 But Gavaskar said on NDTV India that as far as the pitch of Pune is concerned, he would consider it below average but that pitch was not even pure
 
 And there was no flaw in the pitch of Bengaluru
 tippaniyan The odds of giving such a pitch to the Indian team does not get heavy
 is sawaal par gavaskar ne kaha ki ranchi main pich us tarah kii hogi jaisi england or newzealand series main thi
 
 na ki jaisaa is series ke pehle do maichon main dekhne ko mila
 But he admitted that the Kangaroo team may face problems in Ranchi
 
 The way his important fast bowler Mitchell Starc is no longer in the team, his lack can hurt the team
 
 But he can be replaced by Jackson Bird in the team, who is not a low bowler by any means
 
 
 
 Maxwell may get a chance to replace Mitchell Marsh
 gavaskar ne kaha ki bhartiya or upmahadweep kii pichon par hameshaa se hi ungali uthati he
 
 lekin jab yah timen videsh jaati hai or gend pehali ball se swing or seem hoti he tab koi sawaal nahin uthta
 
 isisi kii reating main pune kii pich ko pur or bengalooru kii pich ko bilo everej reating mili
 
 lekin gavaskar ne enditivi india par kaha ki jahaan tak pune kii pich kaa sawaal he wo use bilo everej maanenge lekin wo pich bhi pur nahin thi
 
 or bengalooru kii pich main koi kharabi nahin thi
 The comments bhartiya team par is tarah kii pich dene kaa daanv baari na pad jaae
 On this question, Gavaskar said that the pitch in Ranchi would be the same as it was in England and New Zealand series
 
 Not as seen in the first two matches of this series
 lekin unhone ye mana ki kangaroo team ko ranchi main dikkat pesh aa sakati he
 
 jis tarah se unke ahm tej gendbaaz michel stark ab team main nahin hai aise main unki kami team ko khal sakati he
 
 lekin unki jagah team main jaikson bird ko jagah mil sakati he jo kisi taur par kam gendbaaj nahin hai
 
 
 
 michel marsh kii jagah maxwell ko mauka mil saktaa he

 Kapil Mishra, suspended minister from Aam Aadmi Party and sacked from Delhi government, has now made up his mind to fight directly with the party, besides Arvind Kejriwal
 abhi tak vah party ke saare kaamon ke liye arvind kejariwal ko nijee taur par jimmedaar bataa rahe the
 Even on some days, the Aam Aadmi Party had called Kapil Mishra an agent of BJP to accuse Arvind Kejriwal
 unhone kaha tha ki kapil mishra bijepi kii jubaan bol rahe hai
 It is another matter that the party did not say much on the serious allegations
 party ne ek line kaa jawaab tay kar diya ki yah vipakshiyon kii chaal he
 With this, party supporters and leaders started sharing Kapil Mishra's picture with Manoj Tiwari and got it in trend

 It is a different matter that Kapil Mishra's picture with Manoj Tiwari was being told recently that Kapil Mishra replied that this picture is almost two years old

 The party decided to respond with a line that it was the trick of the opposition
 isi ke saath party samarthak or netaa kapil mishra kii manoj tiwari ke saath tasviir saajha karne or trend main karaane main lag gaye
 Through this picture, party supporters tried to show that Kapil Mishra is doing all this at the behest of BJP
 yah alag baat he ki baat main manoj tiwari ke saath kapil mishra kii jis tasviir ko haal kii bataaya ja rahaa tha us tasviir par kapil mishra ne jawaab diya ki yah tasviir kareeb do saal puraani he

 com / tp8yd0wp2v The Central Government Employees Organization on Wednesday welcomed the government's announcement of the formation of the Seventh Pay Commission, demanding that its recommendations be implemented from January 1, 2011
 saatvaan vetan ayog kareeb 80 lakh karmchaariyon or pensionbhogiyon ke vetanman, bhatte or pension main sanshodhan par vichaar karegaa
 The comments kanfederation of central government amplise and workars ke adhyakh ke keen kutti ne kaha, ham sarkaar kii saatven vetan ayog ke gathan kii pahal kaa swaagat karte hai, lekin hamaari ek maang he
 It should be implemented from January 1, 2011, as is the case with public sector central undertakings, whose pay scale is revised every five years
 isse pehle, din main vittamantri pi chidambaram ne ek bayaan main kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne saatven vetan ayog ke gathan ke prastaav ko manjuuri de di he or iske suzav 1 janvari, 2016 se lagu ho sakate hai
 Kutty said that during the discussion, the Confederation would demand to include 50 percent of the dearness allowance in the basic salary
 yah kisi vetan ayog ke gathan kii purv shart hoti he
 Generally, the central government increases dearness allowance twice a year, so that employees can get relief from inflation

 Unfortunate that in its quest to target political opponents, Centre is undermining intelligence systems with CBI questioning IB officials
 The government's decision to discontinue five hundred and thousand notes had an impact on every person
 kaarobaari jagat main sabase zyada uthal-puthal sone ke kaarobaar main dikhaai padi
 In this, our ground report revealed that in the Jewelers Lane of Karol Bagh, crores of business took place on the night of 8 November
 itani kharid ki kai dukaanon main sona khatm ho gaya
 The jewels were also finished in the famous shop 'sunar'
 afratfari main log kuch bhi kharidne ko taiyaar dikhe
 Praveen Goyal is the Managing Director of Goldsmith and President of All India Gold Federation
 unhone enditivi india ko bataaya ki "kal puri raat hamane kaarobaar kiya
 "according to him people want to buy anything
 agar sona nahin he to heere yani soliter bhi maang rahe hai
 In fact, as soon as people got the news that from midnight 500-1000 notes were going off, then they went from petrol pumps to gold and silver shops
 kai dukaane subah chaar baje tak khuli raheen
 Even now the gold business continues
 jaankaree ke mutabik log sona kilo ke hisaab se kharid rahe hai
 Many are booking only for kilos

 In today's time, if you do not want to gift Barbie to someone, then dolls made by Suguna Rangaswamy can change your mind
 ye koi normal gudiya nahin hai
 Dolls made by Suguna are special
 suguna kii choti beti yues main padhaati hai
 Suguna thought of doing something different when her daughter asked her mother in Chennai to make superhero dolls for her school children
 sugana ne superhiro kapadon ko mix match kiya
 Talking about her creativity, she says that she wanted to make dolls with which children can connect themselves
 wo unhen apane anusaar naam de saken
 Suguna has done many such experiments with Cinderella
 kisi ek doll ko unhone behad saadhaaran se kapade pahanaakar taiyaar kiya he to kisi ko princes luk diya he
 Suguna now wants to make Goldilocks but it is a bit difficult to make
 wo kahati hai, 'teen bhaaluon ko silana kathin he lekin main ek nahin bananaa chaahati
 It does not look good
 ' suguna ko dolls banane ke order chennai, bangaloru or mumbai se milte hai
 She says, 'making dolls is like meditation for me
 ' 77 saal kii suguna 40 saal se gudiya bana rahi hai
 But there is also one thing that his speed has decreased slightly with age
 suguna jab kolkata main rahati thim tab unke ghar 'womens vikali' magazine aati thi
 He learned to make dolls from the same magazine
 suguna kii duusari beti jayapriya ne bataaya ki unki maa 1970 se dolls bana rahi hai
 When those people shifted to Chennai in 1980, his mother started making dolls to give gifts at the birthday party
 jayapriya kahati hai, 'jitani bhi dolls yaa tedi bear maine dekhe hai wo bahut kute hote hai lekin unki ankhe thodi badi or khatarnaak hoti he
 Whenever the mother sits down to make dolls, her face is very relaxed
 'suguna kai agxbijations bhi laga chuki hai
 But due to family responsibility, he never made it a business
 suguna kahati hai, 'main sabase pehle housewif hum
 Family comes first for me
 mujhe iskaa koi dukh nahin he
 Now that my children have settled, i can now do my work well
 'teen maheene pehle tak suguna chennai or bangaloru ke do dukaanon ke liye dolls bana rahi thim
 But now both shops are closed
 ab wo privet orders leti hai or akjibishan lagaati hai
 Suguna says, 'I meet my friends here when i don't go to my children
 dharmik jagahon par jaati hum or apane ghar main puja rakhti hum
 i am very busy
 mere paas bilkul bhi samay nahin he

 har daur main saawali heroin ne apane abhinay kaa loha manvaaya he
 It is a different matter that the color of the line has also become blond like Michael Jackson over time

 Can not deep color and confidence run together? 
 
 kam se kam gora banane kaa daawa karne vaale vigyapanon se to yaheen tasviir logon ke man main aati he
 Some surveys have also put a stamp on the prejudices and thinking about color that if you are white, it helps to get jobs and progress
 aise main ye sawaal zarur poochna chahie ki hunar, qabiliyat or mehnat, gahare yaa halke rang ke farq se halke ho jate hai
 Whether it is dark or dark or black, people change their outlook for you
 logon kii soch badale isse pehle hamen khud ko badalanaa hoga, jab rang or aatmavishvaas hamaari soch main ek duusare ke poorak ho jaaenge to samasya bad jaaegi
 If you don't mind, remember the face of Mahatma Gandhi, AR Rahman, Nandita Das, Hollywood actor Will Smith, boxer Mohammed Ali, and basketball player Michael Jordan
 yaqiin ho jayega ki rang badalane kii nahin soch badalane kii zarurat he
 To us and to those who think about us because of color

 These are the first 20 cities to become a smart city - Bhubaneswar madhyapradesh main indore ke najadik rau main chal rahe rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke shivi main hissaa lene aae bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah ne kaaryakartaaon se shuukravaar ko kaha ki ve party kii majbootee ke liye kaam karen
 Shah arrived in Indore on Friday to join the Sangh program
 vimaanatal par party ke varisht netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ne unka swaagat kiya
 During this, Shah congratulated the people present for the new year and said that all the workers should work to strengthen the party further
 nae saal main karen party ko majbootshah ne vahaan upasthit kaaryakartaaon se party ko majboot karne kii apil kii
 Shah said, 'I have come to join the Sangh camp
 jab party ke kaarykram main aauungaa, tab aap logon se charchaa karuunga
 Right now i just want to say that in the new year you guys should make effort to strengthen the party so that we can all serve Maa Bharati
 'sangh kaa indore ke rau main paanch divasiy vishwa sangh shivi chal rahaa he
 Union workers of the country and abroad are engaged in this camp
 is shivi main shaamil hone ke liye amit shah bhi indore pahunche
 Several leaders and activists were present at the airport to receive him, including BJP National General Secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, State President Nandkumar Singh Chauhan, BJP National Organization General Secretary Ramlal, State Organization General Secretary Arvind Menon and Mayor Malini Gaur
 sangh ke pair 39 deshon tak failerashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ne ab39 deshon tak apane pankhafaila liye hai
 The branches of RSS abroad are known as Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS), which has expanded its scope to many more countries
 iskaa network yues or britain samet 39 deshon tak pahunch gaya he
 Ramesh Subramaniam has branches of Kaman Sangh run in 39 countries, which are managed by Ramesh Subramaniam
 unhone 1996 se 2004 ke bich morishas main sangh kii shakhaon ko seoup karne main kaaphi madad kii thi
 Presently, he is presiding over an organization called 'seva', which raises funds for the Sangh program
 ramesh ne kaha ki hindu swayamsevak sangh videshon main baaki hindu sanghathanon ke saath milakar kaam karata he, jinamein chinmay or ramakrishna mishan bhi shaamil hai
 Hence, the name of the foreigners in Badla abroad said that instead of 'rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh', the name 'hindu Swayamsevak Sangh' is used abroad
 kyonki ye bhartiya bhoomi par nahin he, isliye iske liye 'rashtriya' kaa istemaal nahin hota
 This is being done to connect the Hindus of the whole world
 sangh se kareeb 40 duusare sanghathan jude hai, lekin ramesh ke mutabik, videshon main kaam kar rahaa hindu swayamsevak sangh kaa dayera in sabhi se kaaphi bada he
 These countries have a network
 Five of the branches operating in 39 countries are from the Middle East
 in deshon main baahar shakhaaen chalaane kii anumati nahin he isliye yahaan maidan kii bajaay gharon main log ikattha hote hai
 The association has an e-branch in Finland
 ismenvidio conferencingke jariye kareeb 20 deshon ke sangh se jude log shaamil hote hai
 Nepal has the largest number of branches in India after India
 iske baad yues kaa number aata he, jahaan 146 jagahon par sangh kii shakhaaen lagati hai
 The union claims that branches have been in place in the US for the past 25 years
 yues main ye shakhaaen hafte main ek baar lagati hai, jabaki britain main do baar
 There are a total of 84 branches in the UK
 punjab main pehali baar vidhansabha chunaav main haath aajamaa rahi aam aadmi party punjab or desh ke baahar rahane vaale NRI samarthakon ko chunaav main prachaar ke liye utaar rahi he
 a large section of Punjab lives abroad, NRI youth and families of Punjab are famous in their areas, which the Aam Aadmi Party wants to take full advantage of in Punjab
 punjab main aam aadmi party ke NRI cell ke yuth upsanyojak joban randhaava kaa kahana he ki punjab vidhansabha chunaav ke liye ab tak 30 hajaar enarai samarthakon ne prachaar ke liye khud ko party ke saath register kiya he or ab tak 2000 enarai samarthak punjab pahunch chuke hai or kaam shuru kar diya he
 Not only the full flight book for supporters, according to Joban Randhawa, the party's NRI supporters have booked the entire flight, so that hundreds of supporters will reach India for the Punjab elections in January
 AAP enarai samarthakon se bharaa pehla jahaaj 19 janvari ko toronto se dilli utrega jiske baad tamaam samarthak punjab ke liye ravaanaa honge
 At the same time, the second ship will land directly from Amritsar on 24 January from London, about 250 to 300 supporters of both ships will reach India
 aap kaa daawa he ki australia, newjiland, landan, america, canada, katar, saudi jaise deshon se hajaaron aap samarthak aane vaale dinon main punjab aaenge or apane-apane ilaakon main aam aadmi party ke liye chunaav prachaar karenge
 Randhawa, who is also an NRI himself, Randhawa himself was pursuing postgraduate studies in Canada and joined the Aam Aadmi Party in August 2016
 randhaava ke saath unki team main 4 or log kaam karte hai jisamen kul 3 enarai hai
 Joban Randhawa and his team launched the "chalo Punjab" campaign on 4 December 2016
 fasebuk or duusare soshal media madhyamon ke jariye videshon main pehle vaale punjabiyon ko vidhansabha chunaav main aap ke liye prachaar karne ke liye joda gaya he
 Joban Randhawa said that "the victory of the NRI Punjabis for campaigning can increase the party's victory by 30 percent"
 chhattisgarh main bijepi ke paas 50 vidhayak hai, jabaki congress ke paas 39 vidhayak hai or ek vidhayak he basapa kaa
 That is why the BJP candidate's victory is being decided, but the screw is about Saroj Pandey
 party ke bheetar zyaadaatar vidhayak saroj ke paksh main matdaan ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 They are considering him as a candidate imposed by the party high command
 bijepi ke bheetar machi ghamaasan main pradesh adhyaksh dharmalaal kowshik kaa gut kaaphi majboot he
 He has the gift of CM Raman Singh
 duusari orrajnneetik galiyaromen is baat kii charchaa bhi khub he ki saroj pandeya siem kii daud main sabase aage hai
 She is hopeful that after the Assembly elections in 2018, the party will introduce her as the first woman Chief Minister of the state
 rajyasabha kaa diya gaya tikat bhavishya kii raajnneeti se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 It has also come to light that Saroj Pandey has been promised as General Secretary by many leaders, former mlas and some of the sitting mlas
 wo bhi aise samay, jab party ke aantarik survey main kai maujuuda vidhayakon kii tikat khatre main hai
 Their chances of winning are also low
 lihaaja aise kai vidhayak maanakar chal rahe hai ki unhen 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav main tikat nahin milegi
 Due to this, he has got a lot of support from Saroj Pandey
 party sutron ke mutabik kai maujuuda vidhayakon ko saroj pandeya ne tikat dilwane kaa vaada bhi kar diya he, taaki jarurat padane par aise vidhayak bataur mukhyamantri unka naam aage badha saken or use sweekaar bhi kara saken
 For the moment, it has to be seen whether there is cross-voting even within the BJP
 darasal cross voting kii sambhaavnaaon ke maddenjar hicongresane apana candidet utaara he
 However, the BJP has neither rejected nor accepted the possibilities of cross voting in the party
 is bich party alaakaman ne rajya ke sabhi mantriyon or netaaon ko raajnneetik gatividhiyon par kadi najar rakhane ke nirdesh die hai
 Many leaders from Delhi to Raipur are also teaching allegiance to party mlas, so that in no case a situation arises so that the message of division in the party reaches the opponents before the elections

 Then they say vote for PM

 For this, ask the elected member
 "the irony with social media is when i say vote for your constituent so one can take there problems to them, they say Vote for the PM
 When you tag PM to the tweet they say it's not his responsibility to go to the constituent
 — Anurag Kashyap (@anuragkashyap72)may 26, 2019anuraag kashyap ke donon hi twit soshal media par trol karne waalon ko karaara jawaab hai
 When Anurag had pointed out the problem while tagging the PM, many users had advised him how a PM would take care of the people of the entire country
 130 karod kii population he aap aise kisi bhi leader ko is tarah ke twit ke liye blem nahin kar sakate
 This is common sense
 aapako piem modi ko blem karne kii jagah complen file kerani chahie

 aam aadmi party ke saansad bhagwant maan ne loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan se mulaakaat kar apane upar kii gai pradhanmantri kii tippanee par naaraazgi jataai he
 Bhagwant Mann has given a letter to the Lok Sabha speaker in which he has written that the remarks made by the Prime Minister about him should be excluded from the proceedings of the House
 unhone kaha isse ye saaf ho jayega ki pradhanmantri ne galat tippanee kii he
 Bhagwant Mann had earlier used the term 'bharatiya Jumla Party' for BJP which was expunged from the proceedings of Lok Sabha
 ab maan chaahate hai ki isi tarah se pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ke us ansh ko bhi kaarywahi se baahar kiya janaa chahie
 In the letter written to the speaker, it has been said that Prime Minister Modi has spoken some words for me which have hurt him
 agar aap use expanj nahin karti hai to ek saansad ke taur par meraa adhikaar he ki aap pradhanmantri ke khilaaf meraa visheshadhikaar prastaav sweekaar karen, jaise mere maamle ko privillage cameti ko saunpa gaya tha
 Read here - In the Parliament when the opposition stung on the taunt of Modi, the ruling party blossomed in a special conversation with 'ajatak'
 vah aise bol rahe the jaise ki morari baapu pravachan de rahe hon
 He said what evidence does the PM have about what the Prime Minister said about me
 bhagwant maan kaa kahana he ki modi ko ye saaf lag gaya he ki vah punjab main haar rahe hai isliye wo aisi baaten kar rahe hai
 The comment made by the PM is remarkable that during the discussion on the President's address on Tuesday, the Prime Minister had said that there are some people who follow the principle of Charvak
 Had Bhagwant agreed to drink ghee, i would have asked for something else
 aapako bataa den ki bhagwant maan par sansad or jansabhaon main sharaab pikar aane ke aarope lag chuke hai
 The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has sparked a new controversy in cricket politics by suspending membership of the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) on 7 May
 iske ek din pehle hi aaarasie ne lalit modi ko apana nayaa adhyaksh chunaa tha
 The newly elected vice president of the union, Mahmood Abdi, called the board's decision arbitrary and questioned the impartiality of its acting president Shivlal Yadav
 abdi kehete hai, ‘‘hamen unase nishpaksh faisle kii ummid thi lekin unhone shrinivasana kii kathputli kii tarah kaam kiya or aaarasie ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 You can postpone a person's membership, but the suspension of the entire state association is ridiculous
 ’’ iskaa sabase dukhad pahalu yah he ki bisisiai ke toornament main aaarasie ke chune gaye khiladinnon ke khilne par pabandi he
 On the other hand, Modi, who became the president of RCA after five years, addressed his newly elected team from London on May 7 via video conferencing
 ve march 2009 ke chunaav main haar gaye the
 He told his new team of 24 members, including Abdi and second vice president Amin Pathan, that bcci's sanctions would not last long, so RCA should be strengthened
 modi kii vaapasi se rajasthan cricket birdari main ummid jaagi he ki isse cricket ko phayda hoga
 However, it is also politically clear that Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje will not allow her to interfere in the state administration outside of cricket, as the Congress has accused her earlier
 2009 main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne modi ke prati sakhti dikhaai thi
 Now the new government has instructed the sports department not to do anything in favor of Modi or in opposition
 modi ke vafaadaar or kanoonee salaahkaar abdi ko ummid he ki unki bharat vaapasi main koi samasya nahin hogi
 Modi also said after announcing his victory that he has shown his strength against Srinivasan
 modi pehle bhi kah chuke hai ki bijepi ke satta main aane ke baad unki bharat vaapasi aasaan ho jaaegi
 However, with his tweet, he has increased some difficulties for himself by making BJP leader Arun Jaitley and Narendra Modi's ally Amit Shah angry
 lekin centre se congress kii vidaai ko bhaanp jaanch agenciyon kaa rukh bhi unke prati thodaa naram hua he
 Enforcement agencies had made several allegations of violation of the rules against him
 ab in agenciyon kaa maananaa he ki modi ke khilaaf gambhir aparaadh ke pukhta saboot nahin hai
 Of course, Modi and his team will have to go through several legal hurdles to get active in the BCCI
 lekin iske pehle apane paanch saal se kam ke kaarykaal main modi ne rajasthan main rajya cricket ko ek alag pahchaan di thi
 Modi then established IPL and formed the Rajasthan Royals team
 haalanki unke achaanak utthan or tejatarraar style ne rajya main kai logon ko unke khilaaf kar diya
 When he went out of India, the state opened up to all those people who believed themselves to be equal to him
 vaise modi ko waapas aane ke baad khud ko cricket tak hi simit rakhana hoga, taaki ve raaje par boj na bane
 But his opponents say that how can Modi do such restraint? reliance jeeyo ke aane se sabase zyada jis telecom company ko nuksaan hua he wo bharti airtel he
 Bharti Airtel CEO Sunil Mittal has been consistently speaking against Jio's plan and has also complained to TRAI about its promotional offers
 haal hi main unhone kaha he ki dust settle hone main ek saal lagenge
 That is, Jio will make a prime offer for one year, only after this something will be clear
 baharhaal desh kii number-1 telecom company ek saal tak apane customers ko bachaane ke liye kuch to karegi hi
 In such a situation, the company has launched a 28GB data plan for prepaid users at Rs 345, although it is for select users only
 airtel 13 march se apane postped customers ko Airtel Surprise ofer ke tahat free data degi
 Information about this promotional offers from customers is being given through email
 haal hi main Ookla ne airtel ko is saal kabharat kaa fast network kaa aword diya he
 After this, the CEO of the company Gopal Finance has said, 'airtel has become the fastest mobile network in India that we are celebrating
 ham apane customers kaa shukriya adaa karte hai, kyonki unka bina yah sambhav nahin tha
 Special thanks to the postpaid customers and not just talk, but we are going to surprise those customers' The CEO of the company has said that in order to avail the Airtel Surprise offer, customers have to log in to Airtel My App
 haalanki kitna data milegaa yah philhal saaf nahin he
 Recently, the company has introduced a plan similar to Jio Prime for prepaid customers
 iske tahat har din 1GB data diyajayega or isaki keemat 345 se 350 ke bich ho sakati he
 Calling will be unlimited, but you will get 300 minutes every day

 jabaki ASI kii report main 5 nambar kii diwaar to bahut baad main bani he
 Wall number 16 was dug up to 6 meters, but due to gang-way meeting, the excavation had to be stopped
 vaidyanathan ne ASI kii tasveeron ke hawaale se kaha ki vivaadit dhaancha khambhon ke aadhaar par tikaa hone ke saboot mili hai
 Ramlala Virajman's lawyer Vaidyanathan argued that the presence of a lotus figure, circular shrine, Paranala found in the excavation proves that the structure was a temple as it is a feature of North Indian temples
 justise divai chandrachud ne kaha ki aasthaa or vishwaas puri tarah se alag daleelein hai

 Advocate CS Vaidyanathan said that it is a place of importance for Hindus
 yah baudhon kaa pavitra sthaan nahin rahaa he
 It is therefore a reasonable inference that it was a Hindu temple
 justise chandrachud ne kaha ki kya yah daawa karne ke liye un visheshtaon kaa hawala diya ja saktaa he ki yah ek hindu mandir he jo buddha viharon main bhi maujuud he? duusare shabdon main saboot kaa boj aap par yah sabit karne ke liye he ki yah ek hindu mandir he

 Advocate for Muslim parties Rajiv Dhawan said that we have not challenged the Vedas, Upanishads
 rahaa sawaal quran kaa to us par bhi sawaal nahin ha
 Whatever is in writing is before the court
 vakil vaidyanathan ne kaha quran main yah kaha gaya he ki paigambar ke vichaaron ko smriti main rakhane ke liye sunakar unhen likhaa gaya
 i say that the Supreme Court has considered the tradition and religious books in its judgment
 vishwaas ko lekar vaidyanathan ne kaha ki masjid kii mukhya guband main ram kaa janm hua tha
 This is the belief of the people
 vaidyanathan ne kaha ki puraatatv vibhaag ki report ke aadhaar par yah saaf ki yah sthal ram ki janmasthali he
 Because it is not connected to any other religion
 justise chandrachud ne unase poocha ki aap kaise ise ram janmabhumi se jod rahe hai? ham aasthaa par sawaal nahin uthaa rahe ki yah ram ki janm sthali he
 But is it clear from the guess that this is Ramjanmabhoomi
 vahiin, rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki puraatatv report ne adaalat ke sawaal par koi jawaab nahin diya tha
 In conclusion, we raise questions that may be wrong
 unhone kahin nahin kaha ki puraane dhaanche ko todakar masjid khadi kii gai
 Nothing was clear

 pakistan ke purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne pakistani akhbaar don ko die intervyuu main kaha ki pakistan main aatankwaadi sanghathan sakriy hai or aage joda, ''unhen aap aatankwaadi kah sakate hai—kya ham unhen seemaa paar karne or mumbai main 150 se zyada logon kii jaan lene kii ijaajat de sakate hai? mujhe samjhaaiye
 Why can't we prosecute? ”his statement is being acknowledged as an acknowledgment of Pakistan's role in the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack and this statement has created a sensation in a section of our media
 yah sweekaarokti vastav main nau saal pehle july 2009 main ai thi jab pakistani adhikariyon ne hamen ek dogier saunpa tha jisamen unki fedral investegating agency kii jaanch kaa vivaran diya gaya tha or vahi jaanch report pakistan main aapraadhik mukademe kaa aadhaar bani thi
 In this report, the 'defunct' lashkar-e-taiba (let) was accused of plotting the attack, providing money and executing the attack
 isamen pakistani aropiyon ke naam, kuch sajo-saamaan kii kharid se sambandhit soochna, istemaal kiye gaye sanchaar ke network or karachi se unki ravaanagi ke tareeke ke bare main jaankaree di gai thi
 Later that month in the Lok Sabha, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that for the first time Pakistan has accepted that "their citizens and a terrorist organization based in Pakistan have carried out heinous terrorist actions in India
" '' lekin us dogier main do badi khamiyaan thim—aropiyon main mastermind hafiz said kaa naam gaayab tha, or puri tarah se sakriy lashkar-e-taiyaba ko 'niskriy' bataaya gaya tha
 Both of these flaws were an early indication that Pakistani security agencies did not want to take the matter to a logical conclusion
 jis deele-dhaale tareeke se mumbai hamalon kaa mukadmaa chalaaya ja rahaa tha, usase yah baat or bhi spasht ho gai thi
 Nevertheless, Nawaz Sharif's statement is important for some other reasons
 yah pehali baar he jab pakistan ke kisi bade netaa ne apane desh main thap pade mumbai hamale ke mukademe par saarvajanik rup se sawaal uthaaya he
 Further, this statement came months before the general elections in the country from a popular politician with a large support base in Punjab — traditionally considered a stronghold of anti-indian sentiment — against his powerful security establishment in Pakistan
 Fighting for survival
 agar unhen yah andaja hota ki is bayaan se unke janaadhar par pratikul prabhaav padegaa to unhone yah bayaan nahin diya hota
 It expresses the mentality of voters supporting Nawaz Sharif
 2013 main unke chunaav prachaar main bharat ke saath achche rishte rakhane or vyapaar shuru karne par jor diya gaya tha
 It did not have the opposite effect on his voters then and perhaps to some extent
 navaj sharif kaa bayaan pakistan main civil or sena ke bich khinchataan kaa pratibimb bhi he
 In the same interview, he also said, "you cannot run a country where two or three parallel governments are running
" ise rokna hoga
 There can be only one government in a country: constitutional government
 '' tamaam baadhaon ke baavjood unhone chunavi maidan se hatane se inkaar kar diya he or abhi bhi apni party ke star prachaarak bane hue hai
 Since he is a public representative for a public representative based on a very subjective criterion of being Sadiq (honest) and Amin (virtuous) - a condition that can be used against any politician who is detached from the security establishment
 The stay was disqualified for a lifetime, so their fate would depend on the tussle between the civil government and the army there
 ant main yah bayaan is baat ko yaad dilaataa he ki pakistan main suraksha pratishthan kii takat belgaum nahin he
 However, the pan remains the same
 navaj ateet main spasht rup se kah chuke hai ki pakistan ko ab bharat ko apana sabase bada dushman maananaa band kar dena chahie or pakistan kii tarakkee ke liye bharat se rishte sudhaarney par bal de chuke hai
 Many other politicians, who do not depend on the security establishment and have the ability to win for electoral politics, believe the same
 haalanki navaj sharif kii tarah saarvajanik rup se danke kii chot par aisa kehane kii himmat unamem se kisi main nahin dikhi he
 This should also make it clear to us that a policy based on Pakistan's hostile image against India would be fundamentally wrong
 —sharat sabharwal pakistan main ucchayukta rah chuke hai

 Former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Dr
 Farooq Abdullah has once again given a controversial statement
 faruk ne somvaar ko algaavvaadi hurriyat netaaon se kaha ki wo ek binar ke neeche ekajute hon
 Farooq also said that in such circumstances his party National Conference is also with him
 faruk apane pita or jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri shaikh mohammad abdulla kii 111veen jayanti par unki kabr par neshnal conference kaaryakartaaon ko kashmiri bhashaa main sambodhit kar rahe the
 Farooq said, 'I also tell these Hurriyat leaders that you do not follow different paths
 ekajute hon
 By the way, we are also standing with you for the rights of Kashmir
 hamen apana dushman mat samajhen
 We stand with you but we do not support the wrong thing
 hamane kashmir ke liye bahut sangharsh kiya he
 Spent life aaj main aapako is mukaddas jagah se kahana chahta hum ki aap aage badhie, ham aapke saath khadey hai
 As long as you continue on the right path, we will find you with us
 aapkaa ravaiya sahi rahanaa chahie or kashmiri kaum ko aage badhaane vaala hona chahie
 Farooq told his party workers, 'the fire that is here cannot be suppressed
 jab tak hindustan or pakistan hamaare saath insaaf nahin karenge tab tak is aag ko dabaaya nahin ja saktaa
 They will have to do justice to the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh
 jitna ye log aag ko dabaane kii koshish karenge, utana ye or badhegi'
 Farooq said that he wants to tell his party workers not to separate themselves from this movement
 neshnal conference ne hameshaa is rajya ke liye qurbaani di he
 Farooq later asked reporters to clarify the Hurriyat's statement, and his reply was' i am with or against the Hurriyat, that is not the case
 ye jo ajukeshan he ki jo kashmir ke logon ke liye apane haq chaahane kii baat kar rahaa he, neshnal conference us haq ke saamne uske saath he
 As far as he is concerned, we are with him, not against him
 naa pehle kabhi the or naa abhi hai
 In response to a question related to indo-pak relations and Kashmir, Farooq said, "as far as i understand the Prime Minister of the Government of India wants that this issue should be resolved in some way
 or mujhe ummid he ki wo ek naa ek din pakistan se baatcheet karenge
 There is no other way
 ' faruk ne seemaa par bharat or pakistan ko sanyam baratane ke liye bhi kaha
 According to Farooq, people on both sides suffer losses due to border clashes

 Giving information about the aircraft rescue work, Parrikar told reporters, "all the resources have been put in the search for the missing Air Force aircraft, but all the efforts so far have failed

 jadyu ke varisht netaa shivanand tiwari ne bihar main ucch jati ayog gathit karne ke maamle main rajya kii jadyu-bhaajapa gathbandhan sarkaar kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki ucch jatiyon ke garibon ko kisi tarah kaa aarakshan kaa laabh nahin milanaa chahie or unhen garibi se ubaarane ke liye behatar arthvyavastha kaaphi he
 JD (U) General Secretary and National Spokesperson Tiwari said, 'I feel that upper castes should not be given the benefit of reservation which is specially made for backward classes and Dalits
 ’unhone ucch jatiyon ke garibon kii shikayaton par vichaar karne ke liye ucch jati ayog banane ke bihar sarkaar ke faisle ko anaavashyak or bekaar kaa kadam bataaya
 He said, 'I don't know why this has been done but i am strongly against giving any kind of reservation benefits to the upper castes in the country
 ’jadyu netaa ne kaha ki ucch jati ke log sadiyon se nimna jati ke logon ko dabaate rahe hai
 What does it mean to give them reservation or to think about constituting a commission
 tiwari ne kaha, ‘haa, ucch jatiyon ke logon main bhi garibi kii samasya he
 But with the pace of economic development of the country, they will get benefits themselves
 iske liye koi ayog banane or aarakshan dene kii jarurat nahin he
 Tiwari's statement comes at a time when his party leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is making a lot of efforts to expand his base among the upper castes to prepare the party for the event of an alliance with the BJP
 yahaan tak ki rajya main vipakshi dalon ne bhi vaada kiya he ki satta main aane par sarkari naukariyon or shikshan sansthaanon main ucch jatiyon ke garibon ko 10 pratishat aarakshan diya jayega
 It may be that Tiwari's statement did not appeal to jdu's ally BJP, which has a good influence in Bihar, especially among upper caste voters
 bihar main ucch jati ayog ke gathan ko do saal ho chuke hai lekin yah ab tak koi thos sifarish nahin kar paaya he
 Accepting that there is a caste system in Bihar even today, Tiwari said, 'we did not make long promises to end the caste system, but yes there has been a big change
 ’ The more chicken you are fed to a non-vegetarian, the happier it will be, but if the same chicken is served to a vegetarian, it can also cause havoc
 lekin jaraa sochie agar koi shaks vrath khatm hone ke baad shaakaahaari bhojan ke intjaar main ho or use maansaahaari khaanaa de diya jaae to kya alam hoga
 Something similar happened with lawyer Shanmukh Deshmukh
 shanmukh ne 31 may ko food delivery ap Zomato se apane liye paneer butter masala order kiya
 He was also hungry due to the fast, so he was eagerly waiting for his order
 subah se khaali pet shanmukh ke ghar jab khaanaa pahunchaa to unhen use khaanaa shuru kar diya
 But what he knew was that what he considered eating Paneer Butter Masala would be chicken
 aisa isliye hua kyonki paneer or chikan kii gravi dikhne main zyada alag nahin hoti
 When he did not get the cheese test and came to know that the cheese that he ate was not chicken, he called out to the delivery and the restaurant and got angry
 restaurant ne paneer dish phir se bhejne kii baat kahi
 But when the second order came, that too turned out to be chicken
 zomato or restaurant vaale yah nahin jaanate the ki jis vyakti ko do baar paneer ke naam par chikan bheja gaya, wo bombai hai court kii nagpur bench ke vakil honge
 He sent notice to both of them for hurting religious sentiments, to which neither Zomato nor the restaurant responded
 jawaab na milane par vakil ne upabhokta forum main shikaayat kar donon pakshon se 5 lakh rupye nuksaan or 1 lakh rupee pratadna ke liye maange
 Also collected audio recordings of conversations from both sides
 ection lete hue upabhokta forum ne Zomato or restaurant waalon par 55,000 kaa jurmaana lagaaya, jise dene ke liye unhen 45 din kaa samay diya gaya
 In response to the complaint at the Consumer Forum, Zomato said that the complaint was made by lawyers to tarnish the company's image
 Zomato pehle hi shikayatakarta ko rifund de chuki he

 skool prashasan kaa kahana he ki agar 10 din kii chuttee navaratri main de di jaaegi to silebus kaise khatm hoga
 The school administration says that out of 365 days of the year, the school runs for only 210 days
 jisamen 10 dinanavaratriki chuttee bhi milegi to shiksha par iskaa asar hoga
 At the same time, the Congress has given the matter a political color
 gujarat congress adhyaksh amit chaawda ne kaha ki sarkaar ko chuttee dene ke saath-saath shiksha ke str ko bhi dekhnaa chahie
 The level of education should be increased

 He said that the government does not take a decision by asking anyone
 skool or college main chuttee se jahaan bachche khush hai to vahiin navaratri kaa skool management virodh kar rahaa he

 ganeshotsav kii somvaar se dhooma-dham ke saath shuruyaat hone ke baad juni indore kshetra ke chintaman ganesh mandir main ghante-ghadiyal kam or mobile phone kii ghantiyaan zyada baj rahi hai
 Inspired by the unique waves of faith, these calls are coming for Chintaman Ganesh himself, whose innovative devotees have found the easy way of mobile phones to convey their heart to God in this era of Bhagadori
 das divasiy ganeshotsav ke dauraan chintaman ganesh kaa number milanaa khaasaa mushkil he, kyonki duniyabar main faile bhakt unhen phone karke muraadein maang rahe hai
 Rationalists may question the practice of devotees calling the Lord, but the strings of this strange dialogue of sentiment are associated with interesting stories of faith
 mandir ke pujari ashok pathak ne bataaya, 'vaise chintaman ganesh ko unke bhakt kareeb chaar dashak se chitthiyaan likh rahe hai
 But in the high-tech era of communication, from the year 2005, devotees started using mobile phones to bring their wishes to God
 ' unhone bataaya ki jab bhi koi vyakti mobile phone par chintaman ganesh se ‘baat karne kii’ ichha jataata he, vah phone ko sidhe bhagwaan kii murti ke paas le jate hai or un tak bhakt kaa sandesh pahunchaa dete hai
 Pathak tells that the unique tradition of calling Viraje Chintaman Ganesh in a 1,200-year-old Parmarakala temple began when a devotee hailing from Indore settled in Germany
 yah bhakt hajaaron mile ke faasale se bhagwaan ko niyamit taur par chitthiyaan likhaa karata tha
 Once he called the temple priest
 usne kaha ki ab vah phone ke jariye ganesh tak apana sandesh pahunchaana chahta he
 Keeping the feelings of the devotee, his wish was fulfilled
 iske baad se aasthaa kaa yah ajab-gajab silsilaa chal padaa, jo aaj tak jari he
 The temple priest said, 'usually Chintaman Ganesha calls an average of 150 devotees every month
 lekin ganeshotsav main aapako bhagwaan kaa mobile number lagaataar vyast milegaa
 During this, around 200 devotees call him every day from all over the world
 ’ pathak ke mutabik ganesh ke bhakt unase kisi antarang mitra kii tarah lambi baat karte hai or bhagwaan ke saamne apana dil kholkar rakh dete hai
 He told that in this Ganeshotsav, the number of such devotees is more, who are praying to God to get a job with good education and good salary
 un ganesh bhakton kii taadaad bhi kam nahin he, jo bhagwaan ke saamne apni yaa apane sage-sambandhi kii shaadi karaane kii guhaar laga rahe hai

 Cricket Australia said that only three fast bowlers have been included in the team, and the national selection panel will assess the number of fast bowlers after the second Test to be held in Bengaluru
 tippaniyan Australia has not won a Test match in India since 2004 and the four-test series will be a tough test for Captain Smith & Co
 team ke bare main baat karte hue antarim rashtriya chayankarta trevor hons ne kaha ki panel ne atirikt spin gendbaaz ko shaamil kiya, taaki spin main kaaphi vikalp maujuud hon
 "we don't know what the pitch conditions will be at each venue, but we wanted to expand on the options available," said Hones
 
 
 " Leg spinner Mitchell Swepson has been picked to bolster the spin department, who has yet to play a match for the Test team, while all-rounder Glenn Maxwell returns to the Test squad after more than two years
 steve smith kii aguwai vaali team main chah visheshgy ballebaaj, chaar spin gendbaaj, teen tej gendbaaj, do olerounder or ek wicketiper chune gaye hai
 Australia's Test series against the top-ranked Indian team will begin in Pune from February 23, followed by matches from March 4 to 8 in Bengaluru, March 16 to 20 in Ranchi and March 25 to 29 in Dharamsala
 cricket australia ne kaha ki team main sirf teen tej gendbaaz shaamil kiye gaye hai, or rashtriya chayan panel bengaluru main hone vaale duusare test ke baad tej gendbaajon kii sankhya kaa akalan karegaa

 The Prime Minister of India and Bangladesh are going to sign on Friday the historic land boundary agreement which has been stuck for 41 years
 thik ek maheene pehle sansad ne aam raay se is bill ko manzuri di thi
 Over the years, thousands of people living in these enclaves, such as those who lived in a state without work, could neither work in India nor Bangladesh
 inke paas na rashan card the, na voter aaidi, na passport, na shiksha yaa swasthya kii suvidha
 Now all this will change with this agreement
 pradhanmantri modi ke mutabik ye berlin kii diwaar girane jaisaa he
 Those living in the enclave say it is like rebirth
 yahaan ke shyamali or prabir kii shaadi 12 saal pehle hui
 But it would not have happened if Shyamali's father had known that the groom is a boy residing in the Bangladeshi enclave within the Indian part and who actually has no state
 jodi banane waalon ne bataaya hi nahin ki ladkaa anchlev main rahata he
 My father liked them
 lekin unke paas koi dastauez nahin hai
 It is difficult for our children to go to school
 aspataal main hamaara ilaaj nahin hota
 If the father knew that the boy lived in the enclave, we would not be married
 debabrat 37 saal ke hai, lekin isi vajah se unki shaadi nahin hui
 The bad thing is that he also got a college degree by becoming an Indian, but could not get work
 unka kahana he ki bie karne ke baad bisaef main naukari ke liye applai kiya tha
 But he did not have resident permit or employment office papers, so he did not get the job
 1947 se hi sarhad ke donon taraf aisi 111 bhartiya bastiyaan or 51 bangladeshi bastiyaan hai jo galat taraf pad gai hai
 More than 51,000 people have lived in them
 is seemaa samjhaute ke baad ye anchlev un deshon kaa hissaa ho jaaenge jahaan ve padate hai or yahaan rahane vaale apni naagarikta chun sakenge
 The comments ab yahaan ke logon kaa kahana he ki ham bharat or bangladesh ke pradhanmantriyon ko dhanyavad dete hai ki unhone akhirkaar mudda sulajhaa diya
 It is like rebirth
 jaise hamen phir se azaadi mili ho- duusari baar
 Now the people living here are doing thanksgiving rallies
 narendra modi ne seemaa samjhaute kii tulana berlin kii diwaar giraae jane se kii he
 And the people living in these settlements feel that they have got second freedom

 This 'maulana' of terror has always shed blood on Indian soil
 isaki karatuuton kii fehrist main taaja hamalaa he pulavama kaa aatanki hamalaa
 Maulana Masood Azhar has made Punjab province of Pakistan his destination
