 These cases are referred to such colleges where there are vacant seats

 ’swasthya rajya mantri ashvini kumaar choube ne kaha he ki yadi koi medical college galat tareeke apanaataa he to sarkaar uske khilaaf sakht karrwai karegi

 ) By the way, 2017 has been very heavy for Indian politics
 is puure saal kashmir se kanyakumari tak or bengal se gujarat tak kii raajnneetik gatividhiyaan surkiyon main rahi
 The year 2017 has been very memorable for the Bharatiya Janata Party
 jahaan bijepi ne uttar pradesh main 15 saal baad satta main vaapasi kii to vahiin pratishtha se jude gujarat main satta bachaane main safal rahi
 Also, it was a mixed year for the Congress Party
 is saal dakshin kii raajnneeti main jayalalita ke mrityu ke baad paidaa hue shunya ko bharne ke liye bhi tamaam tarah kii kavayad dekhi gayi, to vahiin north east main manipur main bhi bhaajapa kii dhamak dekhne ko mili
 However, some big political activities also took place this year which could determine the direction of Indian politics in the coming years
 rahul gandhi kaa congress adhyaksh banankhirkaar saal 2017 main wo lamhaa bhi aa gaya jab rahul gandhi ko congress adhyaksh ke rup main chun liya gaya
 Although it was almost certain for many years that after Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi would take charge of the Congress, but when was this a big question
 saal 2017 ke disambar maheene main rahul gandhi ko aadhikarik rup se congress adhyaksh ke rup main chun liya gaya he
 Now the challenge is to re-create the Congress on Rahul Gandhi
 kabhi desh ke zyaadaatar hisson main raaj karne vaali congress aaj chaar rajyon main simat gayi he
 It will be interesting to see how Rahul Gandhi challenges Narendra Modi in the coming year
 yogi adityanath kaa uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke rup main shapath grahansaal 2017 main uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhartiya janata party ne jabardast pradarshan karte hue vidhansabha kii 403 siton main se sava teen sau siton par jeet darj kii
 However, after this fierce victory of BJP, a lot of speculation was raised about the Chief Minister
 lekin akhirkaar gorakhpur ke saansad yogi adityanath ko is pad ke liya chunaa gaya
 The appointment of Yogi Adityanath as Chief Minister has been very important in many respects
 pehla yogi kii chhavi kattar hindutvvaadi netaa kii rahi he
 In such a situation, by making him Chief Minister, BJP made it clear that BJP is not in a mood to compromise its Hinduist image
 saath hi yogi kaa mukhyamantri banaae jane ko log bhaajapa ke paas modi ke baad ke vikalp ke rup main bhi dekh rahen hai
 Yogi will also be expected to perform better in Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh in the coming years
 kyonki yahi vah pradesh he jisane saal 2014 main bhaajapa ke prachand jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 However, Yogis have been successful in doing better in the state body elections
 camel hasan kaa sakriy raajnneeti main anapichley saal disambar main jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad se hi tamilnadu kii siyasat main kaaphi uthaa patake dekhne ko mila
 To fill the void born after Jayalalithaa, two big superstars of South Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan were discussed throughout the year
 haalanki abhi tak rajnikant is mudde par kuch bhi khul kar bolne se bachate rahen hai
 But Kamal Haasan has taken the path of active politics
 vaise camel hasan ne abhi tak party ke mudde par koi faisla nahin liya he
 But in the coming years, it will be interesting to see if Kamal Haasan will be able to wield his glory in politics like filmstars like MGR, NT Rama Rao and Jayalalithaa
 nitish kumaar kii bijepi ke saath vapasisaal 2014 main narendra modi ko bijepi kii taraf se pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar banaae jane ke baad se bhaajapa or jadyu ke rishton main talkhi aa gayi thi
 However, in 2017, these old partners came together again
 july 2015 main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne lalu yadav ke saath banaae gaye mahagathbandhan ko chhod kar bhaajapa kaa daaman tham liya
 After the decision of Nitish, where another state has come to the bjp's account, the BJP can get its benefit in the Lok Sabha of 2017 as well
 saath hi nitish kumaar jinhen vipaksh narendra modi ke khilaaf ek bade netaa ke taur par dekh rahi thi, unke bijepi se milane se vipaksh ne ek bada netaa kho diya he
 In the politics of Gujarat, the entry of three young leaders has been considered as a BJP stronghold for the last 2 decades
 haalanki, 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhaajapa ko usee ke garh main teen sthaneey yuva netaaon ne kadi chunauti di
 Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mevani could not stop the BJP from winning the sixth in Gujarat
 magar jis tarah gujarat chunaav main in netaaon ke prati logon main utsaah dikhaa wo is baat ke sanket jarur dete dikhe kii aane vaale saalon main yah tikdi gujarat kii raajnneeti main ubhar kar aa sakati he

 datasicurity hamaari pehalipraathamikta he, or ham iske liye kadi mehnat karte hai taaki hamaare dwaara beche gaye divaais surakshit rahen'haalanki is jawaab main bhi company kii taraf smartphone main android apadet ke bare main kuch saaf nahin kaha gaya he
 It will be interesting to see if after this lawsuit, Samsung will also provide information about its sold Android devices worldwide, as long as it will keep getting updates

 It is called Vikas! "this redefining of Akhileshvikasya may seem exaggerated with the confidence of six big projects, but there is no doubt that Akhilesh is going to re-invent himself as a universal symbol of development before taking a mandate on his term in 2017
 Are trying tremendously for iske liye ve na to vaade kar rahe hai, na koi prastaav de rahe hai or na hi koi laqb garh rahe hai

 The imbalance of power in the Yadav family is necessary for Akhilesh to complete all these projects as well as other sporadic works by the end of this year so that he can be taken advantage of in the Uttar Pradesh elections and he should assert his supremacy over other members of the Yadav family
 Could also get a chance

 Despite Akhilesh being the state president of Samajwadi Party (SP), Shivpal has been put in charge of campaigning for 2017, which has led to a power imbalance in this family of six mps and at least 20 members at various positions in politics

 daanv par sapa kaa bhavishaagale saal ke chunaav main daanv par na sirf akhilesh hai, balki samaajawaadee party kaa bhavishya bhi he
 In his first term as the Chief Minister in 1990, Mulayam created the image of being friendly to Muslims by saving the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya and he emerged as a backward leader in the post-mandal movement politics, with which he had a broad mass base
 ab unki sehat bahut thik nahin he, to pakad bhi dhili ho rahi he
 It is now the responsibility of Akhilesh how to keep his traditional vote bank and expand the party base
 yahi vajah thi ki mulaayam ne 2012 main unhen mukhyamantri banwaaya taaki satta kaa hastantaran sahajata se kiya ja sake
 Although Akhilesh's first term as chief minister has been surrounded by controversies related to law and order, bureaucrats have sidelined him as he still considers his father the real head and family members have kept him tied up
 akhilesh darasal apane pita kii jagah lene ke liye ab tak ek janaadhar vaale netaa ke taur par ubhar nahin paae hai
 Partly the reason for this is that Mulayam himself has not been able to loosen control from his side
 is baat kaa dar he ki lagaataar do dashak tak sabase badi kshetreey takat kii bhoomika main rahi sapa paanch saal satta se baahar rahane ke baad haashie par na pahunch jaae or akhilesh kaa rajnatik bhavishya kahin hameshaa ke liye khatm na ho jaae
 To analyze Akhilesh's functioning as the family chief minister, it is important to understand his specific situation
 ek ore unke pita hai, jo aksar apni lagaam kase rahete hai, to duusari ore parivaar ke kuch log hai jinaki satta tak sidhi pahunch he
 For this, we have to understand the Yadav family more deeply
 teen dashak pehle kisaan or pahalwaan ke rup main mulaayam se jo kahani shuru hui thi, vah chaatr netaa se upi ke pichhadon ke liye unke ''netaji" banane se lekar ab haal ke varshon main kuch bhaaiyon, bhatijon, chachere bhaaiyon or bahuon kii jatil paariwarik daastaan main tabdeel ho chuki he
 The nehru-gandhi family is often mentioned in the country as a political empire, but the Yadav dynasty is more complex and united than sonia-rahul-priyanka

 The second section begins with Mulayam's younger brother Abhay Ram Yadav, a proud Gwala of Saifai
 unke bete dharmendra badaayun se saansad hai
 The third section originates from Mulayam's first cousin Ram Gopal Yadav who is a Rajya Sabha MP and is known as "professor" in the family, whose son Akshay is an MP from Firozabad
 iske baad mulaayam ke sabase chote bhai shivpal singh yadav hai jo unke sabase bharosemand kareebi hai
 He is an MLA and his son Aditya is the head of the state cooperative association
 akhilesh khud mulaayam kii pehali patni malti devi ke bete hai or unki patni dimple kannauj se saansad he

 vaise khule main koi ranjish to nahin he or kisi bahari hamale ke khilaaf kunba hameshaa ekajute rahata he, lekin bheetar hi bheetar takaraahaten hoti rahati hai
 There is also an open discussion in the family that Akhilesh has earned the post of Chief Minister by his ability or whether he is taking advantage of it because of his father
 parivaar main uttaradhikaar kii jangmaslan, saifai main ''netaji", ''mantriji" (shivpal) or ''mukhyamantriji" yaa ''bhaiya" ke bich kaa maheen fark is baat se spasht ho jaataa he ki aap is chamakate hue gramin ilaake ke kis hisse main khadey hai
 This is not to say that the war of succession is going on in the open
 akhilesh kai saal tak bachapan main shivpal ke saath rahe the or donon ke bich baap-bete jaisaa rishta he
 Despite this, the question is still unresolved as to which of the two can truly claim Mulayam (who is now partially in a state of recess) on the red heritage of the earth, or is there a third in the family whose proper heir
 Is yet to emerge as 'main samaajawaadee nahin, mulaayamavaadi hum: amar singhmaamle ke or zyada ulajhane kii vajah upi cabinet main varisht mantri or party kaa muslim cheharaa ajam khan kaa rasookh he kyonki ve khud main hi kanoon samajhe jate hai
 The same is Amar Singhka, who specializes in political moves, who had a strong influence on Mulayam till he was ousted from the party in 2010 and has somehow emerged strong again
 amar singh pichley november main mulaayam ke janmdin samaaroh main saifai main upasthit the

 "akhilesh jaanate hai ki kamyaabiyaan dhire-dhire hi hasil hoti hai or ek kamyaabi duusari ke liye rasta banaati he
 It is due to this thinking that the Chief Minister has changed his tactics during the last 18 months
 ve kehete hai, ''tarakkee khud bolti he
 It does not need to be publicized
 "hameshaa se haalanki aisa nahin tha
 Akhilesh came to power in 2012 as the young face of SP against the Mayawati government and came to power
 uttar pradesh kii traasadee yah he ki bispi kii koi bhi sarkaar (1995 ke baad chaar sarkarein) apane bhrashtachar or ghotaalon ke liye jaani jaati hai to sapa kii har sarkaar (1989 ke baad chaar sarkarein) kanoon-vyavastha se judi samasyaon ke liye kukhyat rahi hai
 When Akhilesh first took over the command, there was some doubt, but there was also a hope that he would adopt a fresh and technique-prone method of governance
 rajya kaa sabase yuva mukhyamantri (us vakt 39 saal) kuch din baad hi laachaar najar aane laga
 a week after coming to power, Akhilesh overturned the decision that UP Constabulary was not to be deployed in his home district or neighboring district

 For example, the rule of the Yadavas around Etawah and Mainpuri or the rule of the Jats in Muzaffarnagar and Meerut

 According to a senior police officer, the two most influential units of the UP police dealing with organized crime, the Special Task Force (STF) and the anti-terrorism Squad (ATS), became defunct under the new regime, leading to the re-emergence of the old criminal gangs
 saal bhar bitate-bitate kanoon vyavastha kaa teji se patan hone laga
 Within a few months of assuming command, there was a discussion in the UP Secretariat that the new Chief Minister assimilates himself during policy discussions and often engaged in meetings on his smartphone

 Here he used to constantly meet local TV channels and meet local leaders sent by his father, who had to do some small work
 shaam saat baje ke baad unase milanaa bahut mushkil ho jaataa kyonki yah vakt ve apane parivaar or doston ke sang bitaate the
 Most of these friends were local businessmen whom SP insiders call Akhilesh's "hi-hello Brigade" and blame him for removing Akhilesh from the ground reality
 phir ve aksar videsh yatraaon par rahane lage
 Much of the work was done by Mulayam, his loyal IAS officer Anita Singh (who still closely monitors Akhilesh as Principal Secretary), Shivpal, Azam Khan and Ram Gopal

 ve saaf bole, ''aap nattejey nahin denge to hataa diya jayega
 "his father and other relatives were often difficult to explain on many issues, including the driving force of development, so Akhilesh decided to concentrate on his development projects

 The Secretariat officers, however, believe that they have changed - earlier they did not care about anything but today they are trying a lot

 Similarly, former SP leader Raj Babbar, now in Congress and who defeated Dimple in the 2009 Kannauj Lok Sabha by-election, attributes Akhilesh's performance to "zero out of 10"
 ve aarope lagaate hai ki ''chaar saal tak to sote rahe or ab baari pariyojnaon ko saal bhar main puraa karne kii teji dikhaa rahe hai

 In 2012, when the SP returned to power by winning 224 out of 403 seats, its share of votes was 29 per cent, while Mayawati gained 26 per cent of the votes while in power
 bijepi mahaj 15 fisadi or congress 12 fisadi vot hasil kar saki thim
 But there was a dramatic change in 2014 when the Modi wave in the state put bjp's vote at 43 per cent and Gaddinshin SP was reduced to 22 per cent votes

 The SP is in danger of losing Muslim votes, however, the biggest challenge for Akhilesh is likely to be met by four-time chief minister Mayawati, whose admiration with Mulayam is as personal as it is personal
 muslim voton ke sapa se chhitakane kaa khatra bana hua he, to isaki kai vajahen hai
 These include the government's failure to stop Muzaffarnagar riots, Mulayam's exit from the Grand Alliance against the BJP in Bihar, and his statement that he felt remorseful about firing at kar sevaks desperate to demolish the structure in Ayodhya in 1990, which Muslims are angry about is

 Instead, he hinges on the question whether Akhilesh is able to embrace his new image and take credit for his development works

 As he arrives at the Lucknow airport, while on his next meeting on Kalidas Marg, Akhilesh gets a glimpse of the siege

 The Election Commission has given a big blow to the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of Delhi in terms of the post of profit
 20 vidhayakon ke bhagya kaa faisla chunaav ayog ne kar liya he
 According to sources, the Election Commission has recommended disqualification of these mlas
 shuukravaar ko baithak ke baad apni sifarish raashtrapati ko bheji he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has decided to move the High Court against the decision of the Election Commission
 sansadeey sachiv banaae jane se vivaad main aein vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banaae jane ke baad se hi inaki sadsyta par khatra mandara rahaa he
 The Commission disqualified membership of these members
 isse pehle aam aadmi party ko dilli hoicourt se bhi raahat nahin mili thi
 Saurabh Bhardwaj's Leader of the Aam Aadmi Party on Election Commission, Saurabh Bhardwaj said that nothing has happened like the benefit of which the post is being accused
 hamaare vidhayakon ne sarkari gaadi, sarkari bangala or tankhwaah kaa phayda nahin liya he
 The Election Commission has not listened to us in this matter, has not given any opportunity to the MLA to present his testimony
 saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki mukhya chunaav ayukta eke jyoti ne gujarat main piem modi ke under main kaam kiya he
 Now they are paying the debt of PM Modi
 23 janvari ko unka janmdin he or somvaar ko ritair ho rahe hai
 So want to settle all the work before leaving
 saurabh ne kaha ki somvaar ke baad naa hi modi ji or naa hi brahma ji eke jyoti ko mukhya chunaav ayukta ke pad par rakh sakate hai
 The AAP has accused the Election Commission
 The Aam Aadmi Party has alleged that Chief Election Commissioner AK Jyoti wants to end all pending cases before his retirement, hence the Commission is promptly disposing of old cases
 vah 22 ko ritair ho jaaenge
 Although the ruling party says that the Election Commission cannot decide it, it should be decided in court
 party ne kaha ki vidhayakon kaa paksh nahin suna gaya
 In March 2015, the Delhi government of the AAP party appointed 21 mlas to the post of Parliamentary Secretary, on which a lawyer named Prashant Patel complained to the President, stating the post of profit and demanded the termination of membership of these mlas
 haalanki vidhayak janrail singh ke pichley saal vidhansabha kii sadsyta se istipha dene ke baad is maamle main fanse vidhayakon kii sankhya 20 ho gai thi
 The petitioner said- The allegations were proved, Prashant Patel who complained in this case said that it is completely clear, the membership of these 20 mlas will be canceled
 unhone kaha, "maine yah maamla 2015 main uthaaya tha, puure cese ko dekhne par lagata he ki in vidhayakon kii sadsyta chali jaaegi
 The Election Commission will send its decision to the President, on which the President will give his approval
 "unhone aage kaha, "aap vidhayakon kii sadsyta bachane kii koi gunjaaish nahin he, kyonki khud dilli sarkaar ke mukhya sachiv ne ayog ko die apane halafanama main mana he ki vidhayakon ko mantriyon kii tarah suvidha di gai
 Delhi may have 7 mlas, but they made 28
 "duusari ore, centre sarkaar ne vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banaae jane ke faisle kaa virodh karte hue dilli hoicourt main aapatti jataai or kaha tha ki dilli main sirf ek sansadeey sachiv ho saktaa he, jo mukhyamantri ke paas hoga
 There is no constitutional provision to give this position to these mlas
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 102(1)(A) or 191(1)(A) ke anusaar sansad yaa phir vidhansabha kaa koi sadsy agar laabh ke kisi pad par hota he to uski sadsyta ja sakati he
 This post of profit can be of any government at the center and state
 AAP ke in 20 vidhayakon par he khatra1

 rathore ne balram ko kathith taur par apana khaataa muhaiyaa karaayaa tha
 According to media reports, Balaram used to provide fixed amount in lieu of the accounts he used
 iske saath hi aise logon ke baahar ghoomane jane par unke kharch kii bhi vyavastha karata tha
 On behalf of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad it has been made clear that the organization does not give protection to anyone who commits disrespect and contact
 dilli metro kii bahupratikshit or sabase zyada tej gati vaali airport line kii suraksha sambandhi muyne ko pichley teen maheene main duusari baar shuukravaar or shanivaar ko anjaam diya jayega
 After that it is expected that this line will be opened to the public
 gauratlab he ki conot place or indira gandhi antarrashtriya hawaii adde ke bich kii 23 kilometre lambii yah metro line apni teen antim tithiyon ko paar kar chuki he
 After nearly two weeks of correspondence and clarification, Metro Rail Safety Commissioner (CMRS) RK Kardam has informed Delhi Metro that he will inspect the line on Friday and Saturday
 dilli metro ke nideshak mongu singh ne bataaya ‘metro rail suraksha kamishnar saat or aath janvari ko is line kaa muyna karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye hai
 When asked if CMRS had asked for more clarifications in the matter, Singh rejected it
 aabhohawaa main ghule pradooshan ke jehar kii vajah se dilli kaa dam ghut rahaa he
 The residents of Delhi are longing for fresh and clean air
 aise main IIT se padhe dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kaa daawa he ki unke paas dilli ke pradooshan kii is samasya kaa fori ilaaj maujuud he
 This treatment will remove toxic pollutants dissolved in air and Delhiites will get immediate relief
 kejariwal kaa yah ‘rambaan’ ilaaj he ki helicopters ke jariye pani kaa chhidkaav karaayaa jaae
 When such an 'exact solution' exists, everyone is questioning why there is a delay in implementing it? Let's know what the experts say about it? Firstly, experts are unanimous that the idea of spraying water from a helicopter to remove pollution is completely impractical
 IIT dilli ke professor mukesh khare shahari vaayu pradooshan ke vishay par varshon se kaam kar rahe hai
 They say that if it is tried, it will be nothing but a huge waste of money and water
 professor khare kehete hai, ‘duniya main kahin bhi is tareeke kaa istemaal pradooshan dur karne ke liye nahin hota
 The water sprayed by the helicopter will dry quickly and return to a critical state within a few hours
 haa, helicopter se pani chhidakane kaa istemaal aag bujhane ke liye aksar kiya jaataa he, lekin wo chote kshetra tak hi simit hota he
 The idea of spraying water from helicopters in a metropolis spanning an area of 1500 square kilometers is ridiculous
 bhartiya mausam vigyaan vibhaag (IMD) ke varisht vaigyanik charan singh bhi is vichaar ko sire se khaarij karte hai
 Charan Singh says, 'poisonous haze in Delhi is coming from Punjab and Pakistan
 mausami paristhitiyon kii vajah se ye dilli ke aasmaan main aakar tik rahi he
 If you try to remove it by spraying water with a helicopter, this situation will return only after a while
 ’EPCA (paryaavarniya pradooshan niyantran praadhikaran) ke chairman bhure laal ne is vichaar ko sunate hi hansate hue kaha ki ye pradooshan se nahin raajnneeti se judaa he
 When stressed to suggest a solution to deal with the bad condition of Delhi, Bhure Lal said, it is necessary to know the source of these before dealing with the responsible dust of pollution in the environment
 jaise ki kachche raaston se udne vaali dhul ko rokane kaa acha upaay tanker se pani kaa chhidkaav karnaa he
 It is more effective and less expensive
 helicopter se pani ke chhidkaav par aap kaise sunishchit karenge ki ye sirf mitti vaale kachche raaston par hi giregaa? hamen sadakon par lakhon litre pani bahaane se kya hasil hoga?’janimaniparyavaranvidsunita narayan ne helicopteron se pani chhidakane ke vichaar par kataaksh ke andaaj main kaha, ‘ye meraa vichaar nahin he or main nahin jaanati ki kisi desh ne ise istemaal kiya he
 But the Delhi government has very intelligent people, so they would know better
 ’ sunita narayan ne muskaan ke saath kaha, ‘har koi jaanata he ki helicopter se bahut hawa or dhul udati he
 Researcher at the Center for Science and Environment, Polash Mukherjee, appeared to be airing the idea of spraying water from a helicopter through a fundamental question
 mukherjee ne kaha, pani kahaan hai? dilli jaise bade shahar main helicopter se pani ke chhidkaav ke liye lakhon lakh litre pani kii jarurat hogi
 Is water available in and around Delhi? Shall we use potable water which is already in short supply? mukherjee ne ingit kiya ki jab ek tanker se 25000 litre pani chhidaka jaataa he to wo kuch hi kilometre ke kshetra ko cover karata he
 The meaning of spraying water with a helicopter can then be understood
 agar helicopter se pani chhidakna vyaavhaarik nahin to kya cloud seading ke jariye kritrim barish is samasya kaa samaadhaan ho sakati he? is sawaal kaa jawaab pro
 Mukesh Khare gave this - 'cloud seeding is at least a scientifically sound alternative
 lekin is par hone vaala kharch ise pahunch se dur banaata he
 To collect moisture in the sky, chemicals like silver iodide will be required which are very expensive
 china is tareeke kaa istemaal karata he, lekin kya bade paimaane par ham ye itnaa bada kharch uthaa sakate hai, ye bada sawaal he
 Charan Singh, who is associated with IMD, says about cloud seeding that at this time it will not be possible to make artificial rain even after trying this method
 charan singh kehete hai, ‘cloud seading’ kaa matlab he ki rasayanon kii madad se hawa main nami ko sanghanit karnaa jisase ki kritrim barish ho sake
 But in the present condition there is not enough moisture in the air to make it rain
 ’ye sawaal kiye jane par ki hamaare aasapaas jo koharaa he kya usamen nami nahin he, charan singh ne kaha, ye sari nami bas dharti kii sataha tak hi simit he
 To make cloud seeding a success, there should be moisture in the sky 3 to 7 kilometers above the earth
 is vakt hawa bilkul sukhi he, sardiyon main aisa hi hota he

 Unlike these fictional characters, these real-world spies act as spies for corporate companies, celebrities and personal people
 jasusi ke liye privet detective agenciyaan kai tarah ke course bhi chalaati hai, lekin ye course hi paryaapt nahin he
 To become a detective you must have many other things

 2
 technology main export honek achche jasoos ke liye yah bahut jaruri he ki use technology kii acchhee jaankaree ho
 For example, if you want to remove deleted data from mobile or restore deleted pictures from a desktop, then you can do it yourself
 kyonki kisi or kii madad lene se gopneeyata bhang hone kaa khatra rahata he

 4
 Also know the legal aspect
 It is very important for a good private detective to know all the necessary legal aspects
 privet jasoos kahaan ja saktaa he, kin maamalon kii padtaal kar saktaa he aadi
 He should also know that the case he is investigating is not related to any matter related to national security? Or someone whose picture is taken or whose computer is being hacked, there will be no legal issues
 isaki jaankaree tabhi hogi, jab use puure kanoonee pahaluon kaa jaankaree hogi

 Should be creative: a good private detective can become one who is very creative
 is kshetra main kadam-kadam par creativity kii jarurat padati he
 If you want to chase someone, then you have to do it in such a way that no one can doubt it
 agar kisi se kuch poochna he to sawaal is tarah se frem karne honge ki aap jo chaahati hai, vah aapako mil bhi jaae or use shaq bhi naa ho ki aap uski jasusi kar rahi hai

 Being courageous or having no fear of any kind is an essential quality for a detective

 film main sanjay dutt ke jivan ke kai saare pahaluon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 In it, from the struggles of his life, disputes have been shown about the family and their relationship
 kuch samay pehle relies hue film ke trailor ke ek seen ne sabhi kaa dhyaan apni ore aakarshith kiya
 There was a scene referring to the bad condition of the toilet in the jail where Sanjay Dutt was in, which according to the latest sources, has been removed from the film by the censor board
 mid de ko die gaye intervyuu main sorce ne bataaya ki ''trailor ke baad film ke final edit se toilet overflo vaale seen ko hataa diya gaya he
 The reasons for the removal of the scene are kept secret
 pichley hafte film ko CBFC ke saamne dikhaaya gaya

 ''sanju par bollywood celebs kaa rivyuu, hiraani ko kar rahe sailyutjis ekmaatr seen ko hataaya gaya wo 1993 main jail ke dauraan monsoon ke samay kaa he
 One day, toilet water started flowing due to heavy rains in Sanjay's barrack

 He said that this scene would bring disrepute to the "jail Authority of India" everywhere

 Red trust Lalu yani rashtriya janata dal (argedy) adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav kii siyasat ab apane laal tejasvi ke ird-gird gum rahi he
 Lalu is going to launch his son Tejashwi
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab koi netaa apni siyaasi viraasat ko apane santan ke haathon main saunp rahaa he
 The tradition of childishism in politics has been very old and almost every state of the country has a whole army of leaders who have given political legacy to their children or are preparing to hand over
 lalu apane chote bete tejasvi ko apana uttaradhikari banane ja rahe hai
 They are going to hand over the legacy of their politics to them
 buudhvaar ko patna main parivartan raily ke dauraan tejasvi ko launch kiya jayega
 Actually, Lalu is eyeing the Bihar assembly elections to be held in 2015 and hopes are set on the young voters
 aise main lalu ko lag rahaa he ki tejasvi turup kaa patta sabit ho sakate hai
 Like the Gandhi family, the Thackeray family and the Mulayam family, Lalu Yadav's successor is also coming from the family
 lalu apane chote bete tejasvi ko apni raajnneetik viraasat saunpane ja rahe hai
 Lalu is planning to become the face of the party like Akhilesh Yadav in UP until the Bihar Assembly elections of 2015
 argedy adhyaksh lalu yadav kaa kahana he, 'chaahe akhilesh ho yaa rahul, koi bhi ho, rajanetaaon ke bachche hai to wo anukaran to karenge hi
 Will work, if he works, he will progress further
 'cricket ke maidan se siyasat ke maidan main utre tejasvi yadav kii umr philhal 23 saal he, shaayad isiilie unhone sabase pehle youth card kaa daanv khelaa he
 Tejashwi Yadav is talking about increasing the share of youth in the next elections
 tejasvi yadav kaa kahana he, 'laluji ne kaha ki aanevaale vidhansabha main ham 40 se 50 fisadi tikat yuvaaon ko denge chaahe kisi bhi jati dharm kaa ho jo bhi mehnatee hoga jo bhi samaaj seva main yakeen rakhata hoga ham log charchaa karke, parakh ke usko tikat degen
 According to Lalu Prasad, 'all the leaders in the party have relatives who live in the party
 jis party main parivaar ke log hote hai ve uske prati vafaadaar hote hai
 Now i have a son, daughter or wife, these people will not sing praise of RSS or BJP
 ye apni party ko badhayenge, party ko sahyog karenge
 'whatever Lalu Prasad Yadav argues in favor of the family politics, other parties are also understanding the motive of his Parivartan rally
 tabhi to bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kehete hai ye parivartan raily nahin he, ye netritv parivartan raily he
 In the 90s, when Lalu Prasad Yadav had a government in Bihar, he handed over the command to his wife Rabri Devi when the crisis occurred, but now the time has changed
 har taraf yuvaaon kii baaten ho rahi hai, vikaas kii baaten ho rahi hai isiilie wo apane bete ke rup main party ko nayaa cheharaa dene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Lalu has made vigorous preparations to launch younger son Tejashwi
 or taiyaariyon kii dekharekh kii jimmedaari khud lalu kaa parivaar sambhaal rahaa he
 To mobilize the rally, 13 trains have been booked from every corner of Bihar, on which about one and a half crores have been spent
 lalu kii duusari peedi siyasat main utar rahi he
 But there is a difference of ground-sky between the two generations
 ek taraf hai logon ko puchkaarne, daantne vaale lalu to duusari taraf hai ekadam shant or saumy swabhaav vaale tejasvi
 On one side is Lalu, who lures people in the typical, rustic style, and on the other side he is stunning, who calls technical and social media his mantra
 aise main sawaal ye ki kya lalu apni party ko puraane andaaj se nikaalkar mordan luk dena chaahate hai
 In Bihar, the second generation of Lalu family has descended into politics
 jameen taiyaar kar di gayi he, manch bhi taiyaar he
 Lalu has also chosen the favorite month of May
 lalu kii zyaadaatar safal relia may maheene main hi rahi hai shaayad isi vajah se bete ke liye bhi unhone yahi maheenaa chunaa
 If you compare Lalu Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav, very few things will be found which are similar
 masalan lalu yadav ne chaatr raajnneeti se siyasat main kadam rakhaa, jabaki tejasvi ko viraasat main mili siyasat
 While Lalu was the president of Patna University, the brilliant students tried their luck in the cricket field instead of politics
 lalu ke role model jaiprakash narayan rahe, jabaki tejasvi rahul gandhi kii raah par chal rahe hai
 In the Emergency, Lalu Yadav ate sticks, went to jail, and on the other side, Tejashwi read the lesson of politics in closed rooms
 lalu yadav jahaan theth or desi baaten karte hai vahiin tejasvi nai peedi, computer or soshal media ko apana mantra bataa rahe hai
 He is not even hiding his different thinking from Lalu
 ve kehete hai, 'jaahir si baat he, ho saktaa he hamaare or lalu yadav kii vichaardhaara main bhi antar ho
 Meaning, the kind of generation gap today, you look at IT, how much has become advanced today
 us jamaane main naa to mobile phone tha naa hi laptop tha, to utani jaankariyaan hoti nahin thi
 Today's generation has less time
 soshal meediya kii bhoomika babbti ja rahi he to hamaara ye prayaas he ki soshal meediya ke jariye ki kaise ham zyada se zyada yuvaaon tak pahunche
 'lalu Yadav has given his younger son Tejashwi forward as his political legacy, but the style of meeting people is completely different
 lalu jahaan kaaryakartaaon ko daantne-fatkaarane or puchkaarne ke taur par jane jate hai, vahiin tejasvi kaa cheharaa shant or saumy he
 In such a situation, how much this style of RJD likes, it will decide the time to come
 lalu prasad yadav ko bhi apane bete kaa ye alag andaaj bahut pasand he
 He says, 'stunning style is different, every man has his own style
 ye ladkaa shant he hamaare bachche shant or shaleen he donon he
 'in politics, Tejashwi's opinion on familism is impeccable and he does not consider it wrong
 tejasvi kehete hai, 'kashmir se kanyakumari tak aap dekhie to jitne bhi bade netaa he unke putr raajnneeti main hai
 Be it Omar Abdullah, Akhileshji, Rahulji, or Jaganmohan Reddy or Karunanidhi's children; Everyone has done well kai netaa aise hai jo utane safal nahin ho paae hai, lekin ye sab janata ke haath me hota he, jo kaam karegaa usko janata aage badhaati he
 'overall, Laloo Ka Ye Lal wants to get the party out of the old ways
 lalu kii laalaten ko wo computer se jodne kii taiyaari kar rahaa he, makasad saaf he, mishan 2015

 Official sources said the provisions may or may not be similar to the provisions of the Criminal Penal Code as the investigating officer only reports to the court and no one can interfere in his investigation
 baharhaal, sibiai ke purv nideshak joginder singh ne sevanivrutt nyaayadhishon ke panel ke gathan ko ek swaagatyogy kadam bataaya or kaha ki ise rajya str par karyanvit kiya janaa chahie

 On the evening of 19 July, angry Sharad Pawar's hypophile furore further intensified the heat of the power centers on the Raisina Hill
 rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ne dilli main upie sarkaar or maharashtra main congress ke netritv vaali sarkaar se apane mantriyon ko hataane kii dhamkee thi
 The party claimed that the 'arrogant Congress' was insulting it
 party ne kaha ki vah sammaan chaahati he
 It was not even 48 hours before another angry ally West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced that the Trinamool Congress would not contest elections in West Bengal along with the Congress
 unhone chetavanee di, ''dilli main ham tab tak gathbandhan kaa hissaa bane rahenge, jab tak hamen sammaan miltaa rahegaa, lekin pashchim bengal main ham akele hi chunaav ladenge
 Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav sent a letter to the PMO on 22 July requesting the Prime Minister not to "open retail business in any way for FDI
" '' is patr par makapa ke mukhiya prakaash kaaraat, bhakpa netaa sudhakar reddy or janata dal (es) ke netaa danish ali ke bhi hastakshar the
 The Congress, which always viewed Mulayam's 22 mps as an alternative to Banerjee's mps, suffered a shock
 vaanijya or udyog mantri anand sharma kii banaavati hansi gaayab ho gai, jo tivi camaron par yah bayaan dete phir rahe the ki khudara kaarobaar main epadi par 'joardaar sahmati' he
 After the effective crisis management of the Congress during the presidential election, the little confidence that was returned to it suddenly seems to be suffering
 sahyogi dal jis sarkaar kaa hissaa hai usee kii raah main kaante bichaane ke apane puraane khel main phir se lag gaye hai or jin khootiyon par upie kaa bahumat nirbhar rahaa he, ve phir se gaayab hoti dikh rahi hai
 Pawar's rebellion was most unexpected
 unka swabhaav asthirataa vaala nahin he
 Their 9 mps in Delhi may not be as important, but their legislators have an important role in the coalition government of Maharashtra, one of the richest states in the country
 ve congress-ensipi ke takaraavon or tanaavon se paripakvata se nibatate rahe hai
 Even when the Lavasa project hurt the business interests of his close associate, he deliberately remained silent
 anya sahyogi dal jahaan koi-na-koi maang khadi kar dete, pavaar ne sarkaar ko samarthan jari rakhaa-newclear deal se lekar khudara vyapaar main epadi tak or upie ke raashtrapati ummidavaar ke liye shivasena kaa samarthan jutaney tak
 Perhaps that is why the Congress had accepted that their support would continue
 aakhirkaar is baar bhi vahi hua, jab ki darasal ve congress se kaaphi trast ho chuke hai
 Being a clever leader, Pawar walks through all bets carefully
 unhone vidroh karne kaa samay tab chunaa jab congress ke sankatmochan pranab mukherjee raashtrapati pad ke liye chun liye gaye
 Pawar is the most senior member in the cabinet after Mukherjee
 phir bhi, manmohan singh ne mukherjee kii jagah number 2 kii kursi par raksha mantri e
 K
 antni ko baithaana pasand kiya
 Pawar, who was chief minister of Maharashtra three times, was hurt by this, but he did not make it the main issue of his complaints
 isaki jagah unhone centre or maharashtra sarkaar main congress or sahyogi dalon ke bich behatar samanvay kaayam karne kii maang kii
 The dressing room on 24 July by the Congress is just a promise and not a complete solution to the issues
 manmohan, sonia, pavaar or ensipi netaa prafull patel ke bich 7 res course road par kareeb ek ghante tak chali baithak main yah tay hua ki upie sarkaar ''sahyogi dalon ke saath samanvay banane ke liye jaldi hi ek prabhavi tantra kaa nirmaan karegi
 According to Patel, this committee will be chaired by Sonia Gandhi and it will meet once a month to discuss policy and other issues
 ensipi ko yah bhi bharosa dilaayaa gaya he ki maharashtra main bani samanvay samiti kii baithak lagaataar kii jaaegi
 It has not met for the last three years
 pavaar kii raajnneeti main ek pattern dekhne ko miltaa he
 He broke away from the Congress in 1978 after Indira Gandhi's humiliating defeat in 1977
 1986 main phir congress main laut aae
 After this, in June 1999, he again left the Congress and formed the NCP
 yah 1999 ke aam chunaavon se sirf teen maah pehle kii baat he, jab sonia gandhi party par mushkil se hi pakad bana pai thim
 Pawar caused Sonia Gandhi's foreign origins to break up the Congress
 unhen ummid thi ki trishanku loksabhaa hone kii sthiti main ve pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar ke rup main ubhar sakate hai
 But this did not happen and the NDA coalition returned to power in October
 ab jab congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ne agle kuch maheenon main mantrimandal main shaamil hone kaa sankawt diya he, sonia apane is anicchhuk bete kii aasaan landing sunishchit karnaa chaahati hai
 For this, she wants Rahul to have acceptance among his allies
 ensipi ke ek saansad ne kaha, ''rahul ko agar mantrimandal main shaamil kiya jaataa he to pavaar ko koi samasya nahin hogi, lekin rahul pradhanmantri hon to unki cabinet kaa pavaar hissaa rahenge yaa nahin, yah alag maamla he
 "they even say that Mukherjee once said that he would not join Rahul's cabinet
" pavaar kabhi bhi 10 janpath kii pasand nahin rahe hai
 Sonia has not been able to forget that Pawar broke the Congress on the basis of his foreign origin
 jab ve 20 july ko pavaar se milin to sambhawatah upie-2 ke shashan main pavaar duusari baar hi 10 janpath gaye the
 Generally, Patel has been going to 10 Janpath as a messenger of NCP, while Pawar continues to meet the Prime Minister
 ensipi saansad ne kaha, ''congress ke do netaa aise hai jinase pavaar ko naa kehane main mushkil hoti he
 They are Pranab Mukherjee and Manmohan Singh
 ''mukherjee ne jab se number do kii jagah khaali kii, pavaar chuppi hi banaae hue the
 The NCP chief hoped that he would get a chair next to Manmohan Singh
 lekin 12 july ko hui cabinet kii baithak main yah sammaan antni ko diya gaya
 Antony was once subordinate to Pawar, when both were in the Congress (S)
 congress kaa kahana he ki uske liye number do kii jagah kisi sahyogi dal ko dena mushkil he
 The NCP did not hide its displeasure, but it took the Prime Minister 7 days to realize that something serious had been done
 19 july kii shaam ko unke sahyogiyon ne bataaya ki ensipi ke donon mantriyon-pavaar or patel-ne dilli main hone ke baavjood cabinet kii baithak main aane kii hami nahin bhari he
 Manmohan asked the cabinet secretary to let the other ministers know that they would come late in the meeting and they talked to Pawar over the phone
 baad main usee shaam pavaar 7 res course gaye or unhone manmohan singh ko ek patr saunpa
 In this, he simply wrote that the NCP is a small party, so he is not being given much stature or respect in the UPA
 isliye ve ab apana samay party ke kaam main lagaana chahenge
 An NCP leader said, "it was an offer to resign from the cabinet

 He told them that the Congress was not running an inclusive government
 unhone endie kaa udhaaharan diya jisamen ek adhyaksh ke saath hi ek sanyojak bhi niyukt kiya gaya tha
 The BJP leader (LK Advani) was the chairman of the NDA, then a leader of the allies (first George Fernandes and then Sharad Yadav) its convenor
 pavaar ne yah bhi masalaa uthaaya ki upie-1 se vam dalon ke baahar hone ke baad se hi koi samanvay samiti nahin banaai gai he
 NCP sources said, "sonia patiently listened to them and said that she will try to fix the situation
" unhone yah bhi kaha ki vichaaron main matbhed se sarkaar kamjor hi hogi
 While waiting for the response of the Congress, the NCP, with the help of some allies, got its upper hand
 21-22 july ko mamata banerjee ne kolkata se pavaar ko phone kiya, jabaki patel mumbai ke ek aspataal main bhartee uddhav thakare ko dekhne gaye
 There was also talk of reconciliation between Uddhav and his cousin Raj Thackeray

 treepathi kehete hai, ''ham number 2 kii raajnneeti nahin karte hai
 We believe only in number one
 ''purv raashtrapati pratibha patil kii vidaai ke liye sansad main 23 july ko yojit chaay party main jab sonia patel se milin to unhone unki khushaamad karte hue kaha, ''prafull kuch karo
 "sushma Swaraj, the BJP leader sitting next to him, laughing and said," Don't do anything cheerful
 '' is hansi-majaak main makapa netaa seetaram yechuri bhi shaamil ho gaye or unhone kaha, ''prafull khush karo
 In response to this Patel said in a tone, "first of all you decide
 ''pavaar raajnneeti ke marathon ranor hai
 They are making moves for the next general election
 1991 main jab narsingh raav pradhanmantri ban gaye the to chandrashekhar ne niraash pavaar se kaha tha ki maraathon ne kabhi bhi dilli par shashan nahin kiya he
 Pawar is trying to prove it wrong
 ve ummid lagaae baithe hai ki ve gaiyr-congress, gaiyr-bijepi gathbandhan ke pramukh netaa ban sakate hai jo anya dalon ke baahar se sahyog yaa bina unke sahyog ke hi ek rashtriya sarkaar banane ke liye paryaapt siten juta legaa
 However, the NCP has not made up the numbers to show for rebellion but the quality of government
 patel kehete hai, ''centre sarkaar hamaari ummiido ke mutabik kaam nahin kar rahi or hamaari baton par gaur nahin kiya ja rahaa
 The same is true in the case of the Maharashtra government
 sahyogi dalon ke saath is kuprabandhan se congress ek or bade rajya main haar kaa saamana kar sakati he
 She has already handed over Andhra Pradesh to Jagan Mohan Reddy
 maharashtra main prithviraj chavaan ensipi ke liye roj nai mushkil khadi kar rahe hai
 He publicly expressed his anger at the decision of the division of portfolios even before he became the Chief Minister
 rajya ke zyaadaatar kaddavar mantralay jaise grih, vitt, urja, jal sansaadhan, gramin vikaas, lok nirmaan or janajaatiy vikaas, ensipi ke paas hai
 Shortly after taking charge in November 2010, he had said that the Congress is a big party of this coalition government, so it should get finance and home ministry
 aktubar, 2011 main unhone paryaavaran niyamon ke ulanghan ke liye lavasa city par aapraadhik maamla darj karne ko hari jhandi dikhaa di
 This city, built on a hill near Pune, is Pawar's concept
 philhal yah maamla pune ke seshan court main lambit he
 The NCP has its own reasons for holding power
 pichley saal may main rigerv bank ne maharashtra state kooparative (emessi) bank ke nideshak mandal ko bhang kar diya
 The bank has been controlled by Sharad Pawar's nephew and Deputy Chief Minister of the state for the last 17 years
 chavaan ne tatkaal hi bank chalaane ke liye bhang board kii jagah apane chuninda prashaskon kii niyukti kar di
 MSC Bank funds other banks in the district so that they can give loans to farmers
 rashtriya krishi or gramin vikaas bank (naabard) dwaara kiye gaye ek jaanch se khulaasa hua ki in bainkon dwaara zyaadaatar karj aisi sahakaari chini milon or katai milon ko diya gaya jin par ensipi netaaon kaa sidhaa niyantran he
 Losing control over MSC Bank may make the NCP difficult as it will have no way to provide loans to the sugarcane growing farmers of its mainstay, Western Maharashtra
 ensipi ko bhadakaane ke liye aakhri baat chavaan kii 4 may ko kii gai yah ghoshnaa sabit hui ki ve pichley 10 saal main rajya dwaara sinchai kshetra main kiye gaye kharchon par ek shwetapatr prakashit karenge
 According to the annual economic survey of the state released in March, Rs
 70,000 crore has been spent by the state governments in the last 10 years
 kharch karne ke baavjood sinchit kshetron main sirf 0
 An increase of 1 percent can be done
 1999 se 2010 ke bich ajit pavaar hi rajya ke jal sansaadhan mantri rahe hai, isliye chavaan kii yah ghoshnaa ensipi ke liye badi chot jaisi thi
 The current Water Resources Minister NCP k Sunil Tatkare claims that 0 in the irrigated area of the state in the last decade
 1 fisadi nahin balki 5
 There has been an increase of 5 percent
 ajit pavaar aarthik survey report main chape 0
 Referring to the 1 per cent figure as 'printing mistake', the Chief Minister said that the white paper will clear all the mistakes and reveal the truth
 chavaan ke paas shahari vikaas mantralay bhi he
 In the wake of his predecessor Ashok Chavan losing power due to the Adarsh society scandal, he initially avoided approving new projects
 unhone mumbai ke tatkaaleen nagar nigam ayukta subodh kumaar se nae nirmaan ke bare main ek sakht niti banane ko kaha tha
 Kumar did not approve any upcoming housing projects until a new policy was formed in January this year
 isse ensipi samarthak builder lobby gusse main aa gai
 It is a relief for NCP that Prithviraj Chavan is becoming equally unpopular in Congress
 rajya ke 82 main se 42 vidhayakon ne rajya congress pramukh manikraav thakare or rajya ke prabharee mohan prakaash ko june main patr likhakar mukhyamantri kii karypranali kii aalochana kii he

 'kuch na karo, bedaag bane raho' kii apni chhavi kii vajah se maharashtra ke e
 K
 antni maane jane vaale prithviraj chavaan kaa kahana he ki ve sirf aise prastaavon ko manjuuri denge, jo janhit ke hai
 They have designed such a computerized system in which all the requests made by the mlas are saved, as most of the mlas come to them with requests not to talk about the development project but to approve someone's personal project
 prithviraj chavaan ke ek kareebi ke mutabik mukhyamantri ko shaq he ki aise anurodh main kuch paison kaa len-dein judaa hota he, isliye ve use manjuur karne se bachate hai
 Publicly, the NCP says that it has never demanded the removal of Prithviraj Chavan
 patel kehete hai, ''hamane kabhi bhi maharashtra main netritv parivartan yaa kisi khaas vyakti ko mukhyamantri banane par jor nahin diya he
 "actually, he does not need to do this because the Congress mlas themselves are engaged in besieging Chavan
" purv mukhyamantriyon ashok chavaan, vilasarav deshmukh or susheel kumaar scindia ne shikaayat kii he ki adarsh ghotaale ke maamle main unhen bachaane ke liye mukhyamantri kuch nahin kar rahe hai
 The Congress is slowly realizing that its main opposition is within it

 " is sandarbh main pakistan ke raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ne kaha he, "laden us kisi bhi sthaan par nahin tha, jahaan hamane uske hone kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 "denial though is Pakistan's old habit
 bharat lambe samay se pakistani dharti par aatanki dhaanchon kii maujuudagi kii baat karata rahaa he, lekin pakke sabooton ke baavjood usne hameshaa se hi inkaar kiya he
 However, controversial statements by officials on this action have made it difficult to assess the contribution of Pakistani intelligence and military in the killing of Laden
 america raashtrapati baraak obama dwaara laden ke maare jane kii ghoshnaa kiye jane ke baad america khufia adhikariyon ne washington main patrakaron se kaha tha ki pakistani adhikariyon ko is karrwai ke bare main soochna nahin di gai thi
 US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton later said on Monday that close cooperation with Pakistani special troops helped the US reach its goal
 kuch sainya visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki america ne sambhavat: pakistan ko is suniyojit karrwai ke bare main isliye nahin bataaya tha, kyonki jaankaree li hone ke baad laden vahaan se bhaag saktaa tha
 President Zardari has also acknowledged that the attack on Laden was not a joint action
 lekin unhone laden tak pahunchane main pakistan ke yogadan ko rekhaankit kiya he
 In an ideological column published in the newspaper 'washington Post' titled 'pakistan Did It Part', Zardari stated, "although the Sunday incident was not a joint action, it resulted in a decade of cooperation and partnership between the US and Pakistan
" Only Laden's end has been possible
 " jaradaari ne kaha he, "pakistan main hamen is baat ko lekar kuch santosh he ki al kaayda ke ek patravaahak kii pahchaan karne main hamaare shuruaati sahyog ke kaaran antat: yah din sambhav ho sakaa he
 "after the killing of Laden, the owner of that huge mansion in the city of Abbottabad is now being searched, where Laden was hiding
" yah haveli paanch varsh pehle bani thi
 The newspaper 'dawn' quoted local residents as saying, "nobody had any idea about bin Laden and his family being here
 " ek adhikari ke anusaar, is haveli ko ucch suraksha jone ke kareeb shaayad isiilie banaaya gaya tha, taaki ise videshi khufia agenton or electronic chaukasee va drone se bachaaya ja sake
 An analyst has said, "it was unthinkable for anyone to imagine that Laden would be living in a natural panoramic place like Abbottabad with his wives and children, leaving the rugged hot tribal areas
" " udhar, america khufia agency siie ke nideshak leone paneta ne laden ke maare jane ke baad sambhavit aatanki khataron se sachet rahane ke liye kaha he
 Panetta said in a letter to intelligence agency staff on Monday, "the terrorists will definitely seek revenge and we have to be vigilant and careful
 " ehtiyaat ke taur par pakistan sthit america duutavas tathaa vaanijya duutavas main saarvajanik sevaayen anischitkaal ke liye band kar di gai hai

 a senior Election Commission official said, "we are investigating the issue and a final result will be reached soon

 Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called the country's future Prime Minister Narendra Modi and invited her to visit Bangladesh
 unhone ummid jataai ki donon padosi desh milakar kaam karenge or dwipaksheeya baatcheet se koi bhi samasya hal karenge
 Hours after Hasina's call to Modi, a spokesperson at the Prime Minister's Office told reporters, "she (hasina) has congratulated him (modi) on behalf of the government and people of Bangladesh
" ’hasina ke vishesh sahaayak mahaboobul haq shakeel ne bataaya ki bangladesh kii pradhanmantri ne modi ko bangladesh yatra karne kaa nyotaa diya or dwipaksheeya rishton ko aage badhaane tathaa vaarta ke jariye se tamaam vivaadit muddon ko hal karne kii apni sarkaar kii ichha se avgat karaayaa
 Hasina said, "I hope that the governments of the two neighboring countries will continue to work honestly as in the past to resolve any problem through bilateral talks
" ’gauratlab he ki 16 may ko chunaav ke nattejey saamne aane ke baad hasina ne modi ko patr likhakar kaha tha ki unki party ko janata ne jis tarah kaa janadesh diya he, usase ve donon deshon ke dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko nai bulandiyon tak le jane ke liye milakar kaam kar sakate hai

 isaki puure desh or duniyabar main saraahna hui or logon ne apni khushi va bhaawanaaon kaa pradarshan karte hue iskaa jashn manaaya
 It is clear from reciting the four decisions together that their decision strongly supports the right of choice and choice of the person
 nyaayadhishon ne yah mana he ki is adhikaar main kisi ko apana saathi chunane, yon swatantraaa or kriya kaa adhikaar, prem kaa adhikaar, garima ke saath kisi ke jivan ko jeene kaa adhikaar shaamil he jo keval ghar kii charadivari main gopneeyata kii had tak simit nahin ho saktaa balki yah kisi ke sharir se judaa hua he isliye ise saarvajanik sthalon tak vistaar diya janaa chahie
 The judges' argument, defining this right to individual freedom more broadly, is seen as an extension of the Supreme Court's own judgment in the 2013 Skills Case, in which the court reinstated Section 377 of the IPC and Homosexuality was again judged as a criminal act
 jin maamalon kii fehrist par sanyukt rup se nirnay sunaaya gaya usamen-transgender samudaay ke naagarikta adhikaron ko pahchaanane vaala eneelese (2014) cese, niztaa ke moulik adhikaar ko behaal rakhane vaala puttuswami (2017) cese, apni pasand ke kisi vyakti ke saath sambandh main hone kaa adhikaar kaayam rakhane vaala
 Shafeen Jahan (2018) case, Shaira Bano (2017) case stating that if a law is applied arbitrarily, it can be dismissed as unconstitutional, a petition of the Common Cause in which a person dies But she had an appeal for the right to a respectable death, the Shakti Vahini (2018) case involving the right to choose a life partner as per her choice, constitutional related to a person's personal liberty The Dikar and told the court violates constitutional rights to personal freedom of a person to honor killings and it contains-the system of detention
 vyaktigat swatantraaa ke adhikaar kii nyaayadhishon kii vyakhya ke centre main garima kaa adhikaar he jo niztaa ke adhikaar or bina kisi bhay ke vikalp ke upyog karne ke adhikaar se judaa hua he
 What is very important and which is related to the cases before this decision is that the court has attached the idea of contagion to the right of dignity
 nyaayadhishon ke mutabik, jaise rajya vyaktigat adhikaron kii raksha ke liye baadhya he, usee prakaar samaaj ke liye bhi vyaktigat adhikaron kaa sammaan karnaa utana hi jaruri he
 Thus, the judgment on Navtej Johar case opens the door to possibilities in many such cases where there is violation of the rights of individual autonomy and personal choice of individuals
 chaar maamalon main aae samekit nirnyon ke madhyam se tarkon kaa doosraa samooh anuchhed 14 (samanta kaa adhikaar or kanoon kii samaan suraksha) ke tahat samanta ke adhikaar or samvidhan ke anuchhed 15 (dharm, jati, nasl, ling ityadi ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav kaa nishedh) kii joardaar vakaalat karata he
 The judges believe that the distinction made between Section 377 between "natural" and "unnatural" sexual intercourse is arbitrarily defined, unconfirmed by scientific evidence
 nyaayalay ne sabhi vaigyanik shodhon or drushtikonon ko bhi aadhaar banaaya jinamein american cycatric association, vishwa swasthya sanghathan or bhartiya manochikitsak socity ke is vishay par 2018 main jari drushtikon shaamil hai
 Everyone has assumed that homosexuality is not a mental health disorder and cannot be replaced by any "treatment"
 nyaayalay samalangikta ko prakruti main pai jane vaali vibhinn prakritik yonik vividhtaon main se ek ke rup main manyata detaa he
 The judges abandoned the formal interpretation of the "intelligent Differential Test" in Air India v
 Nargis Mirza case (1981) to quash the earlier decision, in which the Supreme Court upheld a discriminatory rule on cabin crew of an aircraft
 Disparities in policies related to pay and promotions between working men and women in India were justified
 adaalat kaa vah faisla anuchhed 15 kii bahut sankeern vyakhya par aadhaarit tha jisamen purushon or mahilaon kii bhoomikaaon ke sambandh main roodhiwaadee vichaaron ko uchit tehraaya gaya tha or is dharna ko kaayam rakhaa gaya tha ki parivaar ko chalaane kaa jimmaa mahilaon ko uthaanaa chahie
 The Court, while interpreting the provisions of equality, recognized that the law is neutral on the subject, it may have a disproportionately discriminatory effect on a section of society
 is vishisht maamle main dhara 377 vishesh rup se samalangikon kaa zikr to nahin karti lekin algebitii vyaktiyon ke liye vyapak rup se lagu he
 The Court has not only flatly rejected the position given in the Nargis Mirza case but went one step further by saying that the quality provisions in our constitution were interpreted to challenge gender stereotypes, unequal norms, dichotomous representations of human sexuality
 And Justice Chandrachud has called for "changes of sexual experience" and "venomous ways of life and infinite shades of love and longing" Talked about conservation
 nyaayadhishon ne kisi vyakti kii yonik ruchi ke aadhaar par uske saath bhedbhaav rokane vaale eneelese jaise purvavarti maamalon main die gaye nirnyon kaa samarthan karte hue anuchhed 15 kii vyakhya kii or is vishay se jude antarrashtriya cese lau kaa bhi vyapak rup se sandarbh diya
 In this, he reiterates the Naz Foundation's argument in which the Delhi High Court also reached a similar conclusion
 is faisle kaa ek paksh yah bhi he, jo naaz foundation ke nyayadhishon kii bhoomika se jude tarkon ko hi doharaata he, ki adaalaton ke faislon main sanvaidhanik naitikta ko saamaajik naitikta par tarjeeh di jaani chahie
 Dismissing the logic of the "presumption of constitutionalism" (pre-colonial laws of the constitution will be enforced unless they are expressly amended) of the judgment in the Suresh Kumar Kaushal case, the court says Such a presumption is not appropriate in a case where the petitioner has raised an issue relating to a clear violation of fundamental rights
 nyaayalay ne is baat par jor diya he ki jab moulik adhikaron ke ulanghan kii raksha main vidhayika or karypalika vifal rahete hai, tab adaalat ko isamen dakhal dekar adhikaron kii raksha kerani chahie
 The Court has held that even though the number of such people is small, it is the duty of the court to "protect the rights of separate and limited identity
" adaalat ne mana ki dhara 377 kabhi bhi keval abhiyojan se sambhddha nahin thi, balki isamen mukademebaaji kaa dar dikhaanaa, blackmel karnaa, kisi ko daraana or algebitii logon kaa apni pahchaan ko chhupaae rakhkar ise kalankit samajhane kii samskruti ko badhaava dene kaa tha
 The judges of the Supreme Court held that at the core of the character and vision of the Constitution of India are the ideals of plurality, diversity, inclusiveness, equality, fraternity and freedom
 ve bhartiya samvidhan kii parivartaneey prakruti ko ek dastavej ke rup main ujagar karte hai jo jeevant or gatisheel he tathaa saamaajik parivartan ke liye patibaddh he
 In their vigorous expression of constitutional ethics, particularly through the constitutional value of fraternity, the judges made it clear that they were not just talking about violation of rights in the hands of the state, but also of violation of other factors in society
 are doing
 unke faisle un mulyon ko ek khuli chunauti he jo honor kiling ko prashray dete hai, antar-dharmik or antar-jaateey vivaahon main adchane daalate hai, or pariwaron ke apni pratishtha kii raksha ke naam par apharan, balpurvak vivaah, ghar main band karke rakhane jaisi hinsa kii jaati he
 The Court has given its verdict not only to protect the rights of LGBTI persons, but also to treat them equally in the society in which we live
 sanvaidhanik naitikta or bandhuta ke mulya kii unki vyakhya samaaj main bahusnkhyakon or alpsankhyak logon ke sandarbh main thi
 An important aspect of this decision is that it relied on the principle of non-regression
 is siddhant ke anusaar, rajya ko aise kadam nahin uthaane chahie jo jaan-boojhkar adhikaron ke ksharan kaa kaaran ban jaaenge
 The court believes that following the judgment in the Kaushal case will mean that we move away from progressive thinking towards the rights under the Constitution
 nyaayadhishon ne algebitii vyaktiyon ke mata-pita or pariwaron ko bhi sweekruti di he, haalanki inamen se kai dhara 377 ko kanoonee chunauti ke vibhinn charnon main hastkshep karte rahe hai
 The court quoted Justice Leela Seth, who, after the Kaushal verdict, wrote an article in which she held the viewpoint of a mother and a judge and severely criticized the verdict as inhuman and overly cruel
 nyaayamurti malhotra ne apni samekit raay main ek asaadhaaran bayaan dete hue kaha he ki itihaas ko algebitii vyaktiyon or unke pariwaron se maafee maangani chahie kyonki unhen sadiyon se gumnami or bahishkaar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The remorse in Justice Malhotra's statement overturning the Supreme Court's 2013 judgment in the Kushal case reflects the mood of the entire court that the grief, pain, which the petitioners have suffered due to the derogatory words uttered by the judges in their case And he is sorry, he is very sorry for that
 navtej singh johar ne aashaa or badlaav ke ek daur ke liye rasta kholaa jisase logon ko badi raahat mili or ve anand tathaa kritagyata ke bhav se bhare hai
 It is a time to remember and appreciate the untiring stories of so many years and the latent stories of countless unknown people, the attitudes of the law towards them and the contribution of people with different abilities around the world to solve the subject

 rahul ne kaha, 'aapako apane netaaon se yah poochna band kar dena chahie ki ve kis tarah kisi kaam ko anjaam dene ja rahe hai
 Instead of doing this, you should ask yourself how you will do any work
 aisa isliye kyonki desh isi tarah aage badhegaa
 Rahul said this while addressing a gathering
 unase yah sawaal kiya gaya tha ki vah kis tarah nirakshar bacchon ko shikshit karenge
 When a student of Jawaharlal Nehru University asked Rahul this question, the Congress leader said in response, 'can i ask you a question? How are you going to help them? How are you going to help him not as a citizen but as a young Indian? ' GN Azad: In CWC meeting everyone unanimously told him(rahul Gandhi)he did a good job
 
 
 No one has a doubt on his leadership but situation was like that
 If someone can lead the party in such situation
 it's only Rahul Gandhi, if anyone can lead opposition, it's only Rahul Gandhi

 The election symbol battle in Samajwadi Party has now reached the Election Commission
 is vivaad kii sunwaayee shuukravaar ko 12 baje shuru hui
 In the first part, the Akhilesh Yadav camp put forth its point
 jisamen unhone daawa kiya ki unke paas 2 tihaai bahumat he lihaaja 'cycle' unheen ko milani chahie
 On the other side, Mulayam Singh presented his side, he argues that the national president has the right over the symbol
 donon pakshaa kaa sunne ke baad chunaav ayog ne apana faisla surakshit rakh liya he
 Senior Advocate and Congress leader Kapil Sibal, who favored Akhilesh Yadav in the Election Commission, demanded that the cycle symbol be given to the Akhilesh faction
 unhone simbel aadesh ke section 15 kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki party main pratinidhi, vidhayakon, vidhaan parshadon or saansadon kaa do tihaai se zyaada bahumat hamaare saath he isliye chinh hamen diya jaae
 Not only this, Kapil Sibal also said that in case of dispute over election symbol, the decision is based on majority
 jiskaa sankhya bal zyaada hota he chinh usee kaa hota he
 At the same time, the Mulayam group submitted a file of arguments before the Election Commission
 darasal chunaav ayog main donon pakshon kii sunwaayee dopaher 12 baje se hi shuru ho gai thi
 Both parties are asserting their claims on the party symbol cycle
 mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh kheme se ramgopal yadav chunaav ayog pahunche
 At the same time, Kiranmay Nanda, Akshay Yadav and Surendra Nagar also reached the Election Commission
 ramgopal kaa ghar bana war rukkkhilesh kheme ke netaa dilli main camp kar rahe hai
 Ram Gopal Yadav's house remains a war room for the Akhilesh camp before he replies to the Election Commission
 ramgopal yadav ke dilli ke lodhi estate house par sapa ke saansad or anya netaa lagaataar pahunch rahe hai
 Meanwhile, senior party leader Naresh Aggarwal appealed to Mulayam to withdraw the claim from the cycle
 vahiin pichley dinon mulaayam ke rukh main akhilesh ko lekar narmi dekhi gai he chaahe unhen mukhyamantri ummidavaar ghoshit kar dene kii baat ho yaa phir sulah kii
 Let me tell you that Naresh Aggarwal has appealed to Mulayam Singh to step back in the Election Commission and bless Akhilesh
 unhone kaha he ki 'har pita chahta he ki unka betaa aage bade or akhilesh to sitara he
 If Netaji does this, his honor and stature will remain high and we will all remain one
 'haalanki mulaayam singh kah chuke hai ki party ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar akhilesh hi honge lekin abhi tak sulah ke sanket dikhaai nahin de rahe hai
 There is also a thinking in the party that if the Election Commission confiscates the election symbol due to this quarrel, then there may be trouble in the elections, so it would be better to withdraw the claim

 The Opposition, once again citing the facts related to the Rafale deal published in the media, once again reiterated its allegations that it is clear from the latest facts that the Prime Minister's Office was interfering in the Rafale deal, so now they only trust the JPC
 chitthee main kya likhaa he?ek angreji akhbaar main prakashit sarkari dastavej daawa kar rahaa he ki raksha mantralay ne rafel saude ke sandarbh main raksha mantri ko ek patr likhaa tha
 The letter said on behalf of the Ministry of Defense that parallel negotiations in the Rafale deal by the Prime Minister's Office could shock the efforts of the Negotiation Team of the Defense Ministry
 mantralay kii taraf se raksha mantri ko gaye is patr ko mantralay main dipti secretary esake sharma ne 24 november 2015 ko jari kiya or is patr ko mantralay main raksha saudon ke liye jimmedaar diarector general equisishan kii sahmati thi
 What is the allegation of the opposition? Based on this letter, in the proceedings of the Parliament of the day, Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy questioned why the intervention of the Prime Minister's Office intervened when the talks between the Ministry of Defense and the French government were going on to buy Rafale aircraft
 was done? On the basis of these facts, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge called it a serious matter and said that when the Prime Minister, Defense Minister and Air Chief Marshal are saying different things on this issue, then only the way of JPC is left to reveal the truth
 sarkaar ne kya safai di haisamne aae nae tathy or vipaksh ke aaropon ke bich raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne loksabhaa main sarkaar kii taraf se safai di
 The Defense Minister said that all the allegations on the Rafael case have been dismissed and the decision of the Supreme Court is before the country
 lihaaja, vipaksh sirf gade murde ukhaadne kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 Curtain on Rafael, 5 questions of Nirmala who came to Rahul Gandhi's question, Nirmala Sitharaman said on the Ministry of Defense noting that the file noting has not been fully published in the media
 nirmala ne kaha ki tatkaaleen raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne raksha sachiv kii file noting kaa spasht jawaab diya tha
 Therefore, the reply of the then Defense Minister is very important in this context, which was neither published nor raised by the opposition
 nirmala sitaraman ne sadan main bataaya ki manohar parrikar ne apni file noting main raksha sachiv se saaf-saaf kaha ki maamle main shant rahane kii jarurat he kyonki chijen sahi disha main chal rahi hai or kisi tarah kii gadabadi kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Rafael's dynasty: Dassault, seeing the family, not with experience, negotiated with Ambani, Nirmala Sitharaman argued in the House that if the Prime Minister's Office wants to know progress in any matter, it should not be called interference
 vipaksh ke rukh ko raajnneeti or corporate warfere se jodate hue nirmala ne kaha ki vipaksh multinational companiyon kii yuddh niti se prerit he or vah mahaj raajnneetik laabh ke liye rashtriya suraksha ke mudde par raajnneeti kar rahaa he
 See the complete statement of Nirmala Sitharaman, while reversing the whole matter, Nirmala Sitharaman targeted former Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 nirmala ne vipaksh se poocha ki kya maujuuda samay main vah maanata he ki purv congress sarkaar ke kaarykaal main sonia gandhi ke netritv main gathit neshnal adwijuri council ko bhi vah pradhanmantri karyaalay main hastkshep ke taur par dekhtaa he? lihaaja vipaksh ko rafel saude par sawaal tabhi uthaanaa chahie yadi vah purv sarkaar ke enesi ko bhi pradhanmantri karyaalay main hastkshep ke taur par dekhtaa he

 An investment of Rs 5 lakh crore should be ensured
 ravat ne kaha ki bihar main agle paanch saal ke dauraan 2
 An investment of Rs 5 lakh crore can be done only when it is given special state status like Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh and a favorable climate for investment will be created here
 unhone kaha ki audyogikeekaran ke lihaaj se sampann anya pramukh rajyon ke baraabar aane or ucch vikaas dar ko hasil karne ke liye bihar main aadharbhoot sanrachana ke kshetra main kul sakal rajya gharelu utpaada kaa kareeb 20 fisadi nivesh kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Rawat said that there is a lot of development potential in Bihar, but due to the low level of economic and infrastructural base, this state is struggling for progress
 unhone kaha ki asocham ke vishleshan ke mutabik, bihar main hameshaa maujuud raheen dhanchaagat khaamiyon kii vajah se nijee kshetra ke niveshak is soobe se duuri banaae rakhi he
 Rawat said that with the status of special state status to Bihar, the economy, industry and infrastructure of this state will get a new shine and the standard of living of the people of this state will improve
 unhone kaha ki uttarakhand ke baad bihar kii arthvyavastha desh main sabase teji se viksit ho rahi he
 Bihar's annual growth rate 9 during the year 2004-05 and year 2012-13

 Rawat said that the areas of education and health along with financial inclusion to be fully opened up by the possibilities in Bihar is remarkable and improvement in it is the need of the hour
 unhone kaha ki agar bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja diya jaataa he to desh kii arthvyavastha main uskaa yogadan varsh 2012-13 ke 2
 3 in 2016-17, up from 87 percent
 4 pratishat ho jayega
 Asked about the demand for grant of special state status to Bihar by recommending additional financial support to backward states in the Raghuram Rajan Committee report, Rawat disagreed with this and said that the Center should take this report seriously Taking how to accelerate development in backward states, it should be ensured

 The debate between Amit Shah of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Digvijay Singh of Congress and Manish Sisodia of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) turned into an open political battle as many had expected
 bahes kii shuruyaat hui chunavi samar ke kurukshetra uttar pradesh se or dhire-dhire chalate hue yah bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar narendra modi ke grih rajya gujarat par pahunch gai
 The seating arrangement on the stage was also somewhat different - Digvijay and Sisodia were sitting on one couch and Shah on another
 congress or aap ke bich yah dhilaa-dhaala manchi ‘gathjod’ pratikatmak rup se yahi dikhaa rahaa tha ki chunaavon ke pehle ye donon avadharana ke str par daud main aage chal rahi bijepi ko maat dene kii har sambhav koshish karne main jute hai
 Here is a select piece of political clout of these three giants: Amit Shah: If you look all over the country, you will see a wave in favor of Narendra Modi
 isaki vajah yah he ki upie sarkaar ke 10 saal ke shashan main mahangaai, bhrashtachar or mahilaon main asuraksha kaa maahaul paidaa hua he
 There are many issues on which people are very dissatisfied and they are very angry
 
 
 jab se narendra modi ko bijepi kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa daavedaar banaaya gaya he, logon main ummid jag gai he or ab unhen lekar puraa desh jaise ek sur main bolne laga he
 Digvijay Singh: It is said that Narendra Modi is capable of running a good administration
 main amit shah se poochna chaahunga ki kya sushasan kaa unka yahi raaj he ki unke rajya main 32 police adhikari jail main hai? jahaan mantri apradhi hai? hamen sushasan kaa koi aisa model dikhaaiye jahaan ek mantri jail main ho yaa hamen sushasan kaa vah raaj bataaie, jisamen doshi siddh hone ke baad bhi koi mantri cabinet main bana hua ho? hamen is sushasan kaa raaj bataaie jahaan karj 1,72,000 karod ru
 There was no debt on Gujarat in 1995
 
 
 ise hi aap sushasan kehete hai?amit shahanmain aap sabko bataanaa chahta hum ki ve (digvijay) mere bare main baat kar rahe hai
 Yes, i went to jail
 iske liye modi kaa raaj jimmedaar nahin he
 This was due to the Congress' revenge policy
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki sibiai ne jo bhi maamle darj kiye hai, ve sabhi farji hai
 Manish Sisodia: i was in Gujarat for the last two days
 vahaan main rashtriya or rajya rajmargon se sate gaanvon main gaya
 i found that what Modiji has been saying since the year is not correct
 ve yahi baat pichley 12 saal se kehete chale aa rahe hai ki gujarat ne jabardast tarakkee kii he
 The reality is that there is access to roads there for the last 25 years
 skulon kaa jahaan tak maamla he, chaar kamare jarur bane hai
 But do you think that these four rooms can be called a school? What about the facilities there and the quality of the teachers? Four rooms have been built in the name of the school in Mehsana district, but what about the toilet? 5,300 to the teachers working on the contract
 prati maah die jate hai
 You have come to shape the future of the country with such a modest salary? Amit Shah: What Manish is saying is not completely true
 chaar saal tak adhyapakon ko ek tayshuda rakam di jaati he
 After that, when they become permanent, they start getting full salary
 moderetarakya tayshuda rakam sirf 5,300 ru
 He is? Amit Shah: Yes, and all this is completely on paper
 lekin yah koi nayaa tathy nahin he jo ab aap desh ko bataa rahe hai
 Moderator: See Amitji, Manish Sisodia and Arvind Kejriwal were still in Gujarat, they also went to Narendra Modi's house
 kya aapako lagata he ki dilli ke purv mukhyamantri ko gujarat ke mukhyamantri se milane or unke saath ek cap chaay pine tak kaa haq nahin he?amit shahndekhie, saarvajanik jivan main aapako kuch niyamon or khaas baton kaa paalan karnaa hota he
 Former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should have taken time to meet the Chief Minister
 jab chunaavon kaa samay ho to aise maukey par vipakshi partiyon se baat karnaa or phir media ke saamne siyaasi rup se uskaa tiya-paancha karnaa thik nahin mana jaataa
 Awesomely speaking, “we went to see development in Gujarat
 hamen vikaas nahin mila
 Is this the name of someone living there? ”- Manish Sisodia“ Gujarat is the state where 32 police officers are in jail and one is a criminal minister
