 sarkari aspataalon kii halaat kitni acchhee he yah kehane kii zarurat nahin hai
 Some hospitals are fine
 jahaan sahi ilaaj hota he lekin vahaan bheed itani he ki ilaaj kara panaasan nahin he
 Sometimes i can get treatment, sometimes i do not
 uttar pradesh ke mainpuri ke pradeep pichley 45 dinon se apane 18 maheene ke bachche ko lekar ek aspataal se duusare aspataal bhaag rahe hai lekin unke bete kaa ilaaj nahin ho paa rahaa he
 They are getting frustrated everywhere
 kahin doctor nahin he to kahin bed khaali nahin he
 If a bed is not empty in a government hospital for 45 days, then it is a matter of concern
 pradeep ke bete ke sir main pani he, jis kaa asar puure sharir par hone laga he
 One day Pradeep's son suddenly got fever
 dawaai khaane ke baad bukhaar thik to hua lekin kuch din ke baad ek pair ne kaam karnaa band kar diya
 When Pradeep went to the doctor, the doctor asked him to do ultra sound
 sir ke ultrasound se pataa chalata he kii pradeep ke bete sir main pani he jis kaa asar puure badan par ho rahaa he
 He was then asked to undergo treatment in Agra or Delhi
 agra main treetment karnaa pradeep ke liye sambhav nahin tha isliye vah dilli aa jate hai taaki kisi na kisi sarkari aspataal main unke bete kaa ilaaj ho jaae
 Pradeep first arrived at Deen Dayal Hospital
 23 agast ko pradeep ke bete ko admit kiya gaya
 On August 28, suddenly Pradeep is told to take his son to GB Pant Hospital and get him admitted there
 kyonki yahaan unki bete kii ilaaj sambhav nahin he, pradeep dilli main nae he unhen jibi pant aspataal ke bare main kuch pataa nahin tha
 They did not even know where the GB Pant Hospital is
 pradeep raat bhar dinadayal aspataal ke baahar samay katate rahe or agle din aspataal pahunche
 When he reached GB Pant Hospital with his son, he came to know that the form in the hospital stopped
 jisaki vajah se unhen phir raat jibi pant aspataal ke baahar raat gujaarni padi
 The next morning, Pradeep got the paper made, but his son could not be admitted to the hospital
 kyonki aspataal main koi bed hi khaali nahin tha
 For about 15 days, Pradeep slept outside the hospital with the hope that his number would come and he would get a bed
 ek maheene tak bhagdaud karne ke baavjood jibi pant main pradeep ke bete ko bed nahin mil sakaa
 It was said from the hospital that the bed is not empty
 pradeep ko bataaya gaya ki general ward main bed khaali nahin agar wo chaahe to privet ward main bed book karwaakar apane bete kaa ilaaj karvaa sakate hai
 Private bed fare is Rs 1200 per day and the cost of medicine is different
 pradeep ke paas itnaa paisa nahin he ki vah apane bete ko privet bed main admit karvaa sake
 When nothing happened, Pradeep reached out to lawyer Ashok Aggarwal
 ashok agarwal garib marizon ko privet aspataal ke reserve free bed main admit karaane main madad karte hai
 For your information, let us know that some beds are reserved for poor patients in private hospitals nowadays
 ashok agarwal pradeep ko ek privet aspataal bhejte hai lekin vahaan bhi unke bete ko admit nahin ho paaya
 Pradeep was told that he would be called when the beds were empty
 jab pradeep ne poocha kitna samay lagegaa to unhen yah bhi kaha gaya ki do maheene bhi lag sakate hai
 Pradeep again reached Agarwalji again
 agarwal ne ab unhen ek duusare privet aspataal bheja
 Pradeep also felt frustrated at the second hospital, told him on the first day that there is no doctor in the hospital today, the next day he was told that his son's treatment in the hospital is not possible
 philhal pradeep ke bete kii tabiyat bigadati ja rahi he
 His son's head is getting watery
 bete kaa vajan bhi teji se kam hota ja rahaa he
 Pradeep is feeling helpless due to not getting treatment for his son
 kisi aspataal main doctor nahin he to kahin bet khaali nahin he
 So will the Chief Minister of Delhi and Health Minister help Pradeep
 kya kisi tarah se dilli ke sarkari aspataal main pradeep ke bete ko ek bed milane main madad kar paaenge
 If this can happen, then Pradeep's son will be treated

 affidavit main kaha gaya tha ki sabhi ne 1 janvari 2017 ko hue rashtriya adhiveshan main shaamil theapatkaal adhiveshansamaajawaadee party main chhide dangal ke bich party ke rashtriya mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ne 1 janvari 2017 ko apatkaaleen rashtriya adhiveshan bulaayaa tha
 Akhilesh Yadav was elected the new national president of the party and Mulayam Singh Yadav as the party's mentor
 mulaayam kaa kamjor daawaamulaayam kaa puraa jor ramgopal dwaara bulaae gaye apatkaal adhiveshan ko avaidh ghoshit karne par tha
 According to Mulayam Singh, before Ram Gopal's session was called, he was removed from the party
 iske alaava mulaayam kii daleel thi ki rashtriya adhiveshan sirf rashtriya adhyaksh hi bula saktaa he
 It is being told that Mulayam Singh did not even claim the election symbol cycle
 yahaan hue mulaayam kamajorchunaav ayog ne apane faisle main saaf bataaya he ki party ke samvidhan kii dhara 15 (10) ke mutabik rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak do maheene main kam se kam ek baar jarur bulaai jaani chahie
 Whereas after 25 June 2014, no national executive meeting was called in SP
 yah saaf taur party ke samvidhan kaa ulanghan he
 Apart from this, according to Article 20 of the party's constitution, only and only a seven-member parliamentary board can decide on the distribution of tickets for Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections
 upi chunaav ke maddenjar party ke tatkaaleen rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ne jo list jari kii usase pehle sansadeey board ne ek bhi meeting nahin kii
 This too is a violation of the party's constitution
 ye tha mulaayam gut kaa tark-party ke sansthaapak mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki ab chunaav chihn koi bhi ho, chunaav vahi pratyaashee ladenge jinke tikat unke dastakhat se jari honge
 Mulayam Singh Yadav claimed that the matter is between his father and son, some people were misled by the son
 unhone ramgopal yadav kaa naam to nahin liya, lekin ishaaron ishaaron main bahut kuch kah diya
 Earlier, Mulayam Singh Yadav had reached the Election Commission along with Amar Singh and Shivpal Yadav
 chunaav ayog main unhone party samvidhan kaa hawala dete hue daawa kiya ki vahi hai samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh, akhilesh camp ke daavon main koi dam nahin he
 - Mulayam told the Election Commission that according to the constitution of the party, the national president cannot be removed at the national convention
 rashtriya adhiveshan bulaane ke liye kam se kam 30 din pehle notice dena anivaary he, jiskaa paalan nahin kiya gaya
 -mulayam faction said that there is a process to elect a national president, which was not followed
 ramgopal yadav ko pehle se hi unke pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 So they cannot bring any resolution
 unke party se judane kaa elaan sirf twitor ke jariye hi hua tha, jo ki maanya nahin ho saktaa
 Most importantly, no proposal was brought to remove Mulayam Singh Yadav in the session
 lihaaja nayaa rashtriya adhyaksh chunane kaa auchity hi nahin paidaa hota
 The Election Commission should get physical verification of the Akhilesh camp whose support is claiming

 After the crushing defeat in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Raj Thackeray and his party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) are seen to be in trouble in Maharashtra politics
 biemasi chunaav main party ko keval saat siten mili hai
 This election was a battle for MNS to save its sinking political existence
 kya raaj thakare kaa astitv khatre main he?biemasi main mili karaari haar ke baad yah charchaa garm he ki raaj thakare kaa raajnneetik astitv khatre main he
 There is no doubt that the party is facing a tremendous defeat in the last several elections
 phir bhi philhal yah kahana jaldibaji hoga ki raaj thakare kaa astitv khatre main he
 No party is always powerful in politics
 kad ghatate-badhate rahete hai
 However, it is also a fact that if Raj Thackeray does not change his politics and ways of doing politics, then the path ahead can be difficult
 kya 'marathi maanush’ kaa raag kaam nahin aa rahaa?saal 2006 menshivsenase alag hokar raaj thakare ne apni party manase banaai thi
 Raj Thackeray made his party's main agenda 'mumbai, for the Marathas'
 party ke kaaryakartaaon ne samooche munmbai main uttar bharat khaskar bihar, uttar pradesh se roji-roti kamaane aae logon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 It is possible that Raj Thackeray thought that he would easily defeat the other parties with the help of this emotional issue and get closer to power but it did not actually happen
 ulte party ko chunaav dar chunaav nuksaan hua
 The issue, which won 28 seats in the last salbmc election, was reduced to 7 seats in this time's election
 2009 ke vidhanasabha chunaav main 288 main se 13 siton par jeet darj karne vaali manase 2014 ke chunaav main ek seat par simat gai or 203 siton par party ke ummidavaaron kii jamaanat jabt ho gai thi
 In the 2014 assembly elections, the party fielded candidates for 218 out of 288 seats
 ye saare aankade is baat kii taraf ishaara kar rahe hai ki munmbai or maharashtra ke matadaataaon ko keval 'marathi maanush’ kaa raag alaapne vaali party pasand nahin aa rahi
 Now there is no need to worry about what will happen if you go bald

" yah tarika vartmaan main bal ugane ke liye apanaae ja rahe tareeke se kahin behatar he
 The current method involves transplanting existing hair follicles from one place on the head to another
 'unhone kaha, 'stem koshikaon se bal ugane kaa phayda yah he ki isse anginat sankhya main bal ugaae ja sakate hai, jabaki hair folical ke tareeke main aisa nahin he
 The first method has a limited number of hair growth

 ---input IANS se There have been signs of financial rigging for Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines to lease aircraft from foreign companies
 maalya ne maurishas kii us company se aircraft liye jiske maalik maalya kii hi company yubi group main karmchaaree rah chuke the
 The information director has sent summons to Hitesh Patel and Uday Nayak, directors of two Mauritius companies
 mutual legal assistant treety ke tahat mumbai kii ek vishesh adaalat main maurishas se soochna lene ke liye aavedan bhi diya gaya he
 According to the ed's charge sheet, Mallya had a loan of Rs 900 crore from IDBI Bank, but the bulk of this money was given to foreign companies in exchange for aircraft leases
 maalya nipani suvidha ke mutabik, aircraft lij par lene ke liye kuch chuninda companiyon kaa chayan kiya, bhale hi unke charge baaki companiyon se adhik the
 Investigations have revealed that Mallya used to lease several aircraft from Mauritius company m / s Welling Limited and m / s Welling Sachidanand Limited
 maheene ke rent ke taur par companiyon ko kramash: 1,99,164 or 1,98,557 dollar diya jaataa tha jo usee class ke aircraft ke liye duusari companiyon ke mukaable adhik tha
 Kingfisher Airlines has failed to provide a document agreement related to the lease

 Well-known Hindi poet poet critic pro-writer Ramdarash Mishra is celebrating the 96th anniversary of the age on 15 August today
 ve 15 agast, 1924 ko gorakhpur ke dumri gaanv main janame
 Read from Kashi Hindu University
 gujarat main aath saal adhyaapan kiya
 Then came to Delhi
 gujarat main unhen bahut sneh or aadar mila
 Delhi aae to yaheen ke hokar rah gaye
 Many books were published here, whose number would be reaching some hundred
 kavita, kahani, upanyaas, aalochana, sansmaran, diary, yatra vivaran, aatmakatha, niabandh sabhi vidhaon ko unhone apni rachanaaon se maalamaal kiya he
 He has been a disciple of Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi and has also received wide appreciation for his novels
 saat dashakon ke lekhan ne unhen bahut pratishtha di he
 More than one hundred and twenty dissertations have been written on him and all the books
 unhen ab tak sabhi pratishthit puraskaar-sammaan mili hai, yatha bharat bharti, sahitya academy, dayavati modi kavi shekhar puraskaar, vyas sammaan, shalaka sammaan sahit anek puraskaar
 But devoid of any gluttony of being a writer, Ramdarash ji comes in the ranks of veteran writer Ramvilas Sharma in a rendezvous that he went to meet without asking
 lekhak unase mil kar ek sachche or bade lekhak se milane ke ullas se bhar kar lautataa he
 Right now they are active, writing poems, ghazals, singing memoir, writing diaries, reciting their latest poems to the visitor during leisure time
 milane aa gaye logon ke saath prasannataa se bolte batiyate hai
 The 87-year-old wife Saraswati often keeps him free from the worldly jungle and is often the first teacher to write him, he has also written a novel: a Childhood
 hamaare daur ke jane-maane kavi, kathakaar, gadhykar ramdarsh mishra kii 96veen varshganth par sahitya ajtak ke liye unke ghar par ek exclusive baatcheet kii aalochak kavi om nishchal ne
 - The time that has passed, through which you have passed, the one whom you have been the observer and the devotee, how do you see it today? There are two parts of my time
 ek hissaa vah he jab main ghoomane phirane main, aane jane main kabhi sakriy rahaa or goshtiyon-sabhaaon main bhi jaaya karata tha or apane samay ke anek sahityakaron se milanaa-julna hota tha, aana-janaa hota tha
 So my experience of those days was that it was a great time
 un dinon achche kavi or gadhykar to the hi, unamem aapas main bada bhaichara tha
 There was a family
 main model toun main tha, us samay anek sthanon se achche sahityakar, nae-nae lekhak aa gaye the or aae din goshtiyaan hoti thim
 People used to listen to each other
 yahaan tak ki shahar ke, bich ke bade-bade sahityakar aate the hamaare ghar
 Many great litterateurs came and talked to them, and i think that time i find very valuable
 usase pehle kaa bhi samay bahut pritikar tha jab main banaras main tha
 There we were rising new writers, and gaining strength from each other
 kah saktaa hum ki ham logon ke banane kii prakriya main un goshtiyon kaa bada haath tha jo praayah vahaan hoti rahati thim
 Now at this time i have become a bit locked in the house
 logon ke yahaan aana-janaa bhi ab nahin ho paata he iske saath hi jo is vakt likhaa ja rahaa he, chaahe vah kavita ho yaa katha sahitya ho, usase samyak rup se guzarane kaa ab avasar nahin mil paata he
 There is an opportunity, but the mind is not getting that opportunity, and i also think that at this time the scenario of meeting the writers, getting along with each other, is lost
 agar paridrishy he to bhi un logon kaa he jo ek vichaardhaara ke hai, yani alag-alag vichaardhaaraon ke sahityakaron kaa paraspar saahchary ab dikhaai nahin padataa
 How creative you are despite being at home these days
 kavitaaon, gajalon va diariyon main rame rahanaa
 To sit with people, to talk about the literary scene from its era to the present day - what is the secret of this proactive activism? There are many dimensions of time since i took my leave
 avkaash praapt karne ke pashchaat main apni sarjana main bahut sakriy ho uthaa tha
 Many poetry collections came
 anek upanyaas aae
 Many stories came and compositions also came in many genres of prose
 lekin dhire-dhire ab swasthya kaa shithilyat anubhav karne laga hoon or keval kavita or diary lekhan tak apane ko simit kar rakhaa he or ab to vah bhi sambhav nahin dikhta- to kai baar mujhe lagata he mere din yon hi biit rahe hai
 Sometimes i read something, sometimes i lay down, sometimes i sat talking with my wife
 kabhi aap jaise mitra aa gaye to der tak gapshap kaa anand liya
 Now i have missed walking
 dar lag rahata he ki kahin gir na paduun or kabhi-kabhi yon hi apni puraani filein khol kar baith jaataa hoon or unase guzarane lagata hoon
 i enjoy criticisms written by you or other writers
 meri ghazal kaa ek sher he-man kahata hoon abhi javaan-sa ye chahie or wo chahiethan kahata he, bahut paa chuke ab to chup baithe rahiye
 But there is a line of my song: Quiet but in spite of this mind does not keep going - so even if i do not write anything, the mind keeps experiencing a creative taste from within
 -par iske baavjood har saal aapaki kuch kitaaben aa jaati hai, aapke upar kuch pustaken bhi
 Do you like this attitude of creative celebration? See! Most of the books that are coming out are those that are based on my former creativity
 yani kavita samgr aayaa to usamen kuch nayaa nahin he
 The stories written are being published in the name of the story, and out of these stories new books are being produced; So most of the books are coming in similar fashion
 lekin jaisaa maine kaha ki is vakt koi kavita likh letaa hoon, koi achchhai sandarbh aata he to use diary main utaar detaa hum
 In the course of conversation, i say a lot, as if talking to you today, things are coming out
 ab ye jarur he ki prarambh main to lekhak ko prakaashak khojna padataa he
 The publisher later falls behind the author
 to is samay anek prakashkon ke aagrah se bhi kuch na kuch dene kii sthiti ban jaati he
 That is why i select some of the earlier compositions and give them to them
 yah bhi hota he ki kuch sahruday aalochak baar-baar meri prashansa main kuch likhte rahete hai
 Images of my creativity continue to emerge through that medium as well
 aap saamne baithe hai
 Mouth dekhi baat hai, but i want to say that you have seen my literature in a very intimate way and have considered and written many of my genres with great concentration and detail
 to sach kahoon to swayan mujhe bhi aap logon ke madhyam se apni sarjana ke mahatv ko pahchaanane kaa sukh miltaa he
 - Stayed in many cities
 padhane ke liye banaras main, naukari ke nimitt gujarat janaa padaa
 Then Delhi
 aae or ab to yaheen ke hokar rah gaye hai
 But let me ask, in which of these three cities, the people who got the most love from you still follow you today, so what would you say? Om ji, Banaras were my days of formation and we were a troupe of new writers
 main kah chukaa hoon ki ham logon kaa paraspar milanaa-julna, goshtiyon main shirkat karnaa bahut acha lagata tha
 i will definitely take a name in this regard
 vah he bhai thakurprasad singh kaa
 His love, his fun, gave people and especially me a lot of freshness and the biggest thing was that we had the discipleship of Gurudev Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi
 main chahta rahaa ki naukari banaras main hi lage
 But destiny had to accept something else
 mujhe naukari ke liye gujarat janaa pad gaya
 There is sadness and happiness in the experience of eight years of residence there
 dukh shuru main sthapit hone kaa tha, kintu baad main gujarat ne mujhe bahut pyaar diya
 There was also my spread among the students from Nausari to Rajkot and my students who came out gave me a lot of respect
 aaj bhi gujarat kaa bahut ghanaa pyaar mujhe praapt he
 Once i told my dear disciple Bhola Bhai Patel that Gujarat gave me a lot of love, then he said that you too gave a lot of love to Gujarat
 hindi jagat se bahut se log vahaan adhyaapan ke liye gaye lekin vahaan ke chaatro ne aapse jo pyaar kii anubhuti praapt kii, vah viral he
 i am very proud that i had the privilege of being the mentor of Bhola Bhai Patel, Raghuveer Chaudhary, Mahavir Singh Chauhan and many talented students
 un chaatro ke shishyon ke shishy bhi mujhe bahut pyaar de rahe hai
 Let me tell you one thing
 ek goshtee main kavi badri narayan mil gayi unhone chhutate hi kaha, ''mishra ji main gujarat gaya tha or aapke prati vahaan kaa pyaar dekh kar main dang rah gaya
 "I didn't want to come to Delhi from there, but had to come; And when i was coming, Brother Umashankar Joshi had said that Mishra ji, "you are going from here, we are sad but your real place is the same
 '' is kathan kaa arth shaayad yah tha ki yahaan hamen bade-bade sahityakaron kaa saath milegaa, chunautiyaan milengi, chhapane kii suvidhaayen milengi
 Delhi initially suffered a lot, but gradually it was liked and i started feeling myself in the literary world
 yahaan meri sari pustaken chhapin
 With the loving reactions of Sudhi readers, critics, litterateurs, i began to believe the value of my literature
 yahaan bhi achche shishy mili, achche mitra mili
 But i say with force that the dear disciples found in the eight-year Gujarat residence, could not be found during the long residence in Delhi
 - pehle kaa jo sahitya tha, uski aaj bhi ek moolyavatta he
 People still read old writers, Sur, Tulsi, Kabir, Premchand, Bhagwati Charan Verma, Bachchan, Amritlal Nagar, Shivani, Dharamvir Bharati are still reading today
 par aaj jo likhaa ja rahaa he use kya aagaamee peediyaan usee tarah padhengi jaise aaj ke log puraane lekhakon ko?jo sawaal aapane poocha he vah apane se lagaataar poochta hoon
 It may be a question of my interest, whether it is a question of my study apathy today; i say again and again, i feel that the extent of that literature stops at Nagarjuna, Kedarnath Agarwal, Bhavani Prasad Mishra, Girija Kumar Mathur, Muktibodh and Agnayya - which is still being read today and will be read tomorrow
 yah sahi he ki pathneeyata kaa jo str madhyakaal ke kaviyon main he yaa aadhunik kaal ke aarambh ke va bich ke kaviyon main he, vah yahaan bhi mand pad gaya he
 i said that i am not able to pass through the poems that are being written today
 isliye bahut nirbhaant rup se yah nahin kah paa rahaa hoon ki inamen se kal kya bachegaa or kya jayega
 But by looking at the many superficial writings of today, sometimes i also wonder who would read such people whose compositions did not have the chemistry that used to connect people, like earlier literature
 -aajkal best celler kaa daur he
 What would you say about the growing gap between Best Seller vs
 Best Writing, not of Best Writing? In the context of what i was saying right now, i would like to say that the form of fiction is such that weak stories and weak novels
 Some even take the reader away because they have a narrative
 yah bhi sahi he ki mahaan upanyaas yaa mahaan kahaniyaan yaa mahaan kavitaayen lagaataar nahin aati hai
 Sometimes they come
 ab dekhie, 'ragadrabari' ke baad jo shrilaal shukla ne likhaa vah kya he? mailaa anchal ke baad renu ne jo likhaa vah kya he? to mahaan sahitya apni jagah par he lekin us sahitya kaa bhi apana mahatv he jo mahaan na hokar bhi apane samay, apane samaaj kii vaastaviktaaon se gujarata hua koi lok khadaa karata he
 As far as the best seller and best writing are concerned, i want to say two things regarding the best seller
 ek to yah ki prakaashan ne jis pustak ko best celler ghoshit kiya he, uski jaanch karne koun ja rahaa he? prachaar ke liye bhi prakaashak best celler kii ghoshnaa kar saktaa he
 Kamleshwar's novel 'kis Pakistan' came when the publisher started announcing that it was second edition, third edition, fourth edition etc
 i asked a publisher what it was all about
 usne kaha, pachaas-sau kitaab chhap kar bhi ek sanskaran hota he, teen sau kitaab kaa bhi ek sanskaran hota he or aaj to sachmuch hi 300 pratiyon ke sanskaran chap rahe hai
 So the publisher understands the heart of the best seller
 duusari baat yah ki best celler hona tab acha lagata he jab ki vah acha sahitya bhi ho
 Just like Premchand
 best celler bhi hai or best riter bhi hai
 But in the best seller, there are many books which are written from formulas and whose readers are very light-hearted
 to best celler hone ke saath best riting kaa hona bhi jaruri he
 That is valuable
 kai baar kai kritiyon ko vah prachaar nahin mil paata jaisaa unhen milanaa chahie
 Publishers or critics remain silent about them
 lekin ve dhire-dhire apane mahatv ko, apni moolyawaan ko ujagar karti chalati rahati hai
 Let me say that my work has never received the title of Best Seller from any other side, but i know the importance of my novels
 mujhe maaloom he ki un upanyaason main meraa samay he, meraa gaanv he, meraa shahar he
 Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwiwadi ji, while writing on both my novels 'water breaks' and 'his people', underlined his special time and social significance
 apane log jab aayaa tha to uski badi charchaa hui thi
 Many people spoke on him
 lekin vah kuch khaas aalochakon kii nigaah main anupasthit hi rahaa
 - Writers are often heard saying that criticism did not do justice to them, they were victims of neglect
 is bare main aapke kya anubhav rahe hai?om ji, main apni upeksha ke bare main sochataa hi nahin hoon
 Because i deeply believe in my writing
 main apni kavita or gadhy vidhaon kii rachanaaon ko lekar bada bharaa-pura anubhav karata hoon
 There are two directions of neglect
 ek to yah ki kuch khaas tarah ke log yani kisi ek khaas vichaardhaara main band va aapas main jude hue log apane dal se baahar kii rachanaaon ko na dekhte hai, na unki charchaa karte hai
 Secondly, are the compositions being neglected really worthy of neglect? Aren't you? Therefore many critics, including you, have done a very thorough analysis of my works, have identified their value, many review books have come on my literature
 lagbhag paune do sau ke kareeb mere sahitya
 Dissertations have been written on
 anek patrikon ne visheshank nikaale hai
 My novels, stories and poems have been translated into many languages
 anek vishwa vidyalayon ke vibhinn kakshaon main padhaae jate hai
 i have found the love of such a big world, who cares about some so-called and very critical critics
 ek baat is sandarbh main or kahana chaahunga ki main har tarah se ghar ghusra aadmi hum
 i keep writing by limiting myself at home
 us bhaag-daud se bachataa hoon jiske tahat anek log jaldi hi kuch paa lete hai
 It is to be noted that in spite of neglecting some kind of influential people, after a short time, i too have gained a lot on my own
 puraskaar ke liye jo bhaag daud machi rahati he use aap bhi jaanate hai
 But i am saying with great pride that i did not run for prizes or any other benefit
 is baat ko meri ghazal kaa ek sher acchhee tarah vyakt kar rahaa he: jahaan aap pahunche chalaange laga kar, vahaan main bhi pahunchaa magar dhire-dhire
 And whenever i got the honor, infinite ordinary people got letters, phones were received, their affectionate responses were received
 yah mere liye bahut bady nidhi he
 Know how many characters and characters have come in your stories and novels
 itane bade sansar ko kaise aapane apane lekhan main samet sake hai?ghar-ghusre kaa prayog ek vishesh sandarbh main maine kiya tha ki main ghar se baahar nikal kar tamaam chizon kii prapti ke liye prayaas nahin karata hum
 i have passed through the village, from the town, from the city in the process of living life
 vaani vihaar uttam nagar main rah kar yahaan ke yatharth ke anek ayaamon se gajra hum
 In this way the world of my experience is very large
 vah anubhav maine logon ke bich hokar jikar paaya he, ghar main band ho kar nahin paaya he
 That's why i stay at home and experience myself with infinite people
 lekin un logon kaa saath karne se bachataa hum jo jod-baaki karte rahete hai
 -with the writers getting up and going one by one, going away
 kaisaa lagata he dhire-dhire lekhakon kii yah anupasthiti?vastav main yah jivan kaa satya he ki jo aayega vah jayega hi
 But there are many times that one friend leaves the writer after another continuously, leaving a melancholy rhythm
 dekhie kai hamaare achche sahityakar achche mitra chale gaye ham logon ke bheetar dard chod kar
 Like Kedar ji, Namvar ji, Kunwar Narayan ji, Prabhakar went to Shrotriya
 is bich or bhi kai log gaye- kailash vaajapeyi, bholaa bhai patel, maheep singh, mahavir singh chouhan- to janaa to sabko hota hi he
 Today he went, tomorrow someone else will go, but it is a reality that the leaving of people leaves pain on the minds of the remaining people
 aise hi ek baar jab model toun, dilli main rahaa karata tha to ghatit hua tha
 Then this song was written
 ek-ek ja rahe sabhi / man bada akelaa lagata he
 Our association with those who were going was also important
 jinke saath khele-koode, padhe-likhe, saath uthanaa baithna rahaa, unka janaa keval unka hi nahin, un sabakaa janaa hota he jinke saath unka saannnidhya rahaa
 - Market is very much in your poems
 bazaar par tanj bhi bahudhaa aapane kiya he
 You have also made gestures towards the market entering the house
 par aap jaise gaanv se jude lekhak kaa bhala yah bazaar kya kar saktaa he?bazaar ke bich rah kar bhi bazaar se prabhavit na hona ek baat he or bazaar main rah kar bazaar kaa ho janaa duusari baat he
 For example, it is one thing to live in a city and live in the city, but it is also a matter of walking in the city without taking any rites
 main shahar main rahakar shahar kaa nahin hua, bazaar main rah kar bhi bazaar kaa nahin hua
 But the valuable contribution of the city and the market has to be accepted
 bazaar ek baat he, bazaarwaad duusari baat he
 People used to go to the market and buy Sauda Suluf
 khaas taur se gaanvon main saptahik bazaar lagate the, unka intjaar hota tha or vahaan jaakar log hafte bhar ke liye ghar kii chijen kharidte the
 People from all around met together
 haalchaal poochhate the, khush hote the
 So the city is also required to go to market under its concrete requirements; Have to go
 lekin bazaarwaad to vigyapanon ke jariye tamaam nai nai chizon kaa prachaar karke vah logon kii aavashyaktaa banaae de rahaa he or log un chizon ko laa-laa kar apana ghar patate ja rahe hai
 So the market is entering the house in this form and changing the mindset of the house
 dekhie, ghar main rasoi banati thi jo swaadisht va swasthkar hoti thi
 Now the market has served so many things that the children are eating them broken and getting sick
 to bazaar apni chizon ke saath apni bimariyon ke saath nai maansikta ke saath ghar main paith rahaa he va ghar ko ghar nahin rahane de rahaa he
 Tens of advertisements arrive on mobile every day
 anek anaavashyak chizon kaa pralobhan paidaa karte hai
 -dr
 saab, yon to bahut kuch aapane likh diya he
 Nearly seven decades of writing no less, almost a hundred books
 par phir bhi kya kuch kahana rah gaya he?is sawaal par ramdarsh ji ko apni ek ghazal yaad ho ai
 Wrote so much, wrote what-not-what the mind said
 lagata rahaa phir bhi sadaa kuch or baaki rah gaya
 Then said
 om ji, baat yah he ki maine yojana banaakar na jivan jiya, na lekhan kiya
 i kept expressing what i kept saying and going on over time
 kya baaki rah gaya he or kya kahana he yah chintaa mujhe kabhi nahin hui
 i think i have said what i wanted to say through poetry, novel, story, through essays, and through other prose genres
 yani jo lagaataar anubhav kar rahe hai, use aap apni sarjana main utaar rahe hai
 What new experience will i have now? Tomorrow knows which new thing will challenge tomorrow
 main nahin jaanata ki kya kahana or kya baaki rah gaya he
 Many times people ask such questions even in front of me that after the questions i have asked, what do you want to say? So i want to say that i have not kept anything composed to tell you
 uttar bane banaae rakhe nahin hote hai
 They only come out of the question
 mere saath bhi yahi hua he
 i do not think what i have to say anymore
 iskaa matlab yahi ki abhi bhi kahin tehra nahin hoon
 Will say whatever you say tomorrow
 sarjana kii gatishiltaa man main he
 Despite the age of his age, if he asks time to say it, he will say it
 lekin vah kal kya hoga, yah main nahin jaanata
 When i am writing a novel, in the process i think what to write because it is not a matter of two or four pages
 jindagi kii baat hoti he
 He has to search, he has to search
 jab main upanyaas likhata hum to raat ko neend nahin aati is soch main ki kal kya likhuunga
 But that happens in the process
 katha se jude sandarbhon kii khoj hoti he ki unhen kab kahaan jode, kahaan se le aaen
 In this context, Om ji will narrate a poem to you - (A new collection of Ramdarash ji's song is coming, after picking up his manuscript and he starts to recite a song) i want to write something but nothing comes out; is
 tab likhenge aap jab bheetar kahin jivan bajegadusron ke sukh-dukhon se aapkaa hona sajegatoot jate ek sabut roshni kii khoj main jojante hai jindagi keval safalataa hi nahin he
 Be it small or big, it is not like Hodusro burnt in the heat itself, it is in the shape of a private house, it is not a market of politics, but this coin of Chamcham does not work here
 - yon to unhen jab bhi dekha or paaya he, khushmijaaj hi paaya he par laga ki poochhun ki kya dukh he jo salata he?dekhie, ek to apana shaareerik dukh hota he jo sabko hota he
 Especially in this age, some minor diseases remain for years
 kabhi ghar kii koi samasya salti he
 If a person goes out of a different unpleasant way in the house, it hurts
 lekin ek dukh aisa he jo mujhe aapako va saare samvedansheel logon ko salata he or vah dukh he- samaaj kaa dukh
 Read newspapers, watch TV, as soon as we read, sadness goes like a pity
 ek samvedansheel vyakti ke liye yah ek bada dukh hota he or vah dukh ek sarjanaatmak rup lekar aapke lekhan main utar aata he
 Recently i had a story in 'jansatta': 'good news'
 kahani yon he
 Trapped by the bad news in the newspaper, the man is sad that a courier arrives
 vah shaadi kaa nimantran hota he- ek ladki kii shaadi kaa
 This is good news because that girl is a girl from a poor parent whose owner has left in a hospital in a state of illness
 jab vah acchhee ho jaati he to aspataal use nikaal detaa he
 She is sitting on the road crying that a kind person comes
 use ghar le jaataa he
 Says, you are my daughter
 use maanata he, padhaata he, bi
 a
 karaata he
 All the housemates consider him
 usee ladki kii aaj shaadi ho rahi he
 If he gives such kind of respect to him, then it seems that in such a rich world there is such a man that he is raised like a daughter
 kahani kaa paatr sochataa he ki buree khabaron se laden fande akhabaaron main aisi khabaron ke liye aakhir koi jagah kyon nahin hoti? ve aisi khabar kyon nahin dete ki use pard kar manushya ko sansar kii achchhaayiyon kaa anubhav ho, aadmi kaa man swasth rahe
 It has been afternoon talking to him
 sochataa hoon thak gaye honge ve
 i close the conversation and i see that his songwriter suddenly woke up
 ve geet sangrah kii apni pandulipi uthaa kar ek taaja geet padhane lagate hai
 Om ji listen, a neem manjari, my courtyard, the iron gates are fluttering
 aaj gagan mere ghar jhuk gayabhataka sa megh yahaan ruk gayarag rag main tharthari, sannata aaj riraha mujhe naam le pukaar
 i also hum it with them
 chitt prasann ho uthta he geet kii lay se
 i have to walk upstairs to stand up to leave the door
 unhen vahiin roak unka charan sparsh kar baahar aa jaataa hoon or sadak par chalate hue sochataa hoon pichhali or is sadi main awajahi karne vaale hindi ke is vayasshreshth lekhak ke paas kitne anubhav hai, kitne sansmaran hai, kitna kuch he bharaa bharaa tha
 Like a tree laden with fruit
 desh-kaal se apratihat or paristhiti se rubaru
 i am slowly lost in the crowd, but his conversations, his poems are echoing inside

 ) The Akal Takht chief (jathedar) has demanded a ban on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 unhone somvaar ko kaha ki RSS jis tarah se kaam kar rahaa he, usase itnaa to saaf he ki yah desh ko baant degaa
 Giani Harpreet Singh, Jathedar of Akal Takht Sahib, while speaking to journalists in Amritsar said that yes, it should be banned
 mujhe lagata he ki RSS jis tarah se kaam kar rahaa he usase vah desh main bhedbhaav kii ek nai lakeer khinch degaa
 When it was told to Gani Harpreet Singh, the Jathedar of Akal Takht Sahib that the BJP itself believes RSS, he said that if this is the case then it is not good for the country
 yah desh ko nuksaan pahunchayegaa or use tabah kar degaa
 It is worth noting that a few days ago, Sangh Director Mohan Bhagwat made a big statement about the different incidents of mob lynching happening in the country
 unhone kaha tha ki ‘bheed hatya' (linching) pashchimi tarika he or desh ko badnaam karne ke liye bharat ke sandarbh main iskaa istemaal nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Let me tell you that Mohan Bhagwat said this while addressing the volunteers after 'shastra Puja' at the Reshammibagh ground here on the occasion of Vijayadashami
 unhone kaha tha ki 'linching' shabd kii utpatti bhartiya lokachar se nahin hui, aise shabd ko bharatiyon par naa thopa jaae
 During this, the Sangh chief said that Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Shah should be commended for removing most of the provisions of Article 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir
 yah ek saahasik kadam tha
 He had said that in the last few years there has been a change in the direction of India's thinking, which the people who do not want are in the world and also in India, and for vested interests, these powers do not want to allow India to become strong and powerful
 
 desh kii suraksha par sangh pramukh ne kaha ki saubhaahgya se hamaare desh ke suraksha samarthy kii sthiti, hamaare sena kii taiyaari, hamaare shashan kii suraksha niti va hamaare antarrashtriya raajnneeti main kushalta kii sthiti is prakaar kii bani he ki is maamle main ham log sajag or aashwast hai
 He had said that security vigilance on our land borders and water boundaries is better than before

 There has also been a decrease in militant violence inside the country

 Bhagwat had said that different sections of the society should strive to increase goodwill, dialogue and cooperation among themselves

 The festival of Dussehra means a lot to the Sangh as the organization was established on this day in 1925

 bataa den ki isse pehlerashtriya swayamsevak sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne assam main enarasi se logon ke baahar hone ko lekar logon kii chintaaon ko dur karne ke prayaas ke tahat kaha tha ki ek bhi hindu ko desh chhodkar nahin janaa padegaa
 It was believed that Bhagwat made this remark during a coordination meeting held behind closed doors of the Sangh and its associated organizations
 samanvay baithak ke baad sangh ke ek padaadhikari ne kaha tha ki mohan bhagwatji ne spasht kaha ki ek bhi hindu ko desh nahin chhodana hoga
 He had said that Hindus who came to India after suffering persecution and suffering in other nations will remain here

 This city of Pakistan is the second most polluted city in the world, know what number Delhi is on sarkaar ke rukh ke vipareet supreme court ne pichley saal agast main faisla sunaaya ki yakeenan niztaa samvidhan pradutt moulik adhikaron main ek he, to laga ki ek nai subah hui he
 Activists for years have been embroiled in debates and litigation with officials of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and the rest of the government on whether the Aadhaar database is a threat to the security and privacy of the country and the people
 is puri bahes main sarkaar kaa najariya mote taur par yahi rahaa he ki niztaa uske liye doum darje kii chintaa kaa vishay he, jise vikaas sareekhee baaki jaruraton ke aage gaun mana ja saktaa he
 The Supreme Court rejected this view in the Puttaswamy case and emphasized the constitutional values of freedom and dignity as well as the importance of privacy for development
 chah maheene baad is faisle kaa koi thos asar abhi saamne aana baaki he
 On the other hand, there are reports that Aadhaar data is being stolen and unauthorized use of Aadhaar number and fraudulent withdrawal of money from bank account is being used
 supreme court main aadhaar par aage sunwaayee lambit he
 This may be the final hearing in this case
 lekin kitni raahat milegi, yah saaf nahin he or yah bhi tay maanakar nahin chalanaa chahie ki faisla sakaaratmak hi hoga
 It is also a matter that in all other matters related to the issue of privacy, the Supreme Court surprisingly has not given due consideration to the view which has been the mainstay of the Puttaswamy case
 us faisle main swaittata or nirnay prakriya ko niztaa ke adhikaar se abhinn mana gaya he, taaki ''saamaajik ekarupata kii maang ke vipareet sabhi vyakti apane vishwaas, vichaaron, abhivyakti, soch, vichaardhaara, praathamiktaaon or pasand ko kaayam rakhane main sakasham rahen
 "but it seems that it was forgotten in the case of Hadiya, who was first Akhila and then converted to Islam and converted to Islam and married a Muslim, all by her choice and she kept saying this constantly
" hadiya ke pita ne yachika daayar kii ki hadiya kaa dharm parivartan or nikaah, donon iageies ke dabaav main hue hai to kerala hycourt ne is aadhaar par shaadi ko khaarij qaraar de diya ki ladki ke mata-pita ne shaadi ke liye rajamandi nahin di thi or ve shaadi main maujuud nahin the
 The Supreme Court has not yet reversed the verdict declaring the marriage void
 isaki bajaae usne agast 2017 main rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) se jaanch karaae jane kaa aadesh de diya ki kya yah vivaah 'lav jehad' kii kisi badi yojana kaa nateeja tha
 The court will now reportedly take further action only when the results of the investigation are known
 puttaswami faisle main yah baat maani gai ki niztaa ke adhikaar par kuch vaazib paabandiyaan lagaai ja sakati hai
 In Hadiya's case, an adult woman's right to 'set her own preferences and choices against the expectations of society in a very private matter' was completely sidelined
 is maamle kii roshni main ab yah dekhnaa baaki he ki supreme court aadhaar maamle main aakhri sunwaayee ke liye baithegaa to vah kis had tak rajya kii jaruraton or hiton ke mukaable logon kii swaittata or apane faisla karne kii prakriya ko variyata detaa he
 Not only this, the Kerala High Court, while passing judgment on Hadiya's personal life, used the 'perenz Petrei' jurisdiction in which the state has the right to protect those who fail to protect themselves
 aam taur par is nyaayadhikaar kaa istemaal alpavyaskon ke maamle main yaa phir gambhir maansik rogon se grast logon ke maamle main kiya jaataa he
 But using it, the court is considering itself as the biggest head by taking such a decision against a perfectly healthy 24-year-old woman
 isse yah kchayaal bhi aata he ki dekha jaae, supreme court aadhaar ke maamle main sarkaar kii daleel ko kitni ahmiyat detaa he
 The government's view is probably illustrated by a claim by former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi
 pichley saal may main aadhaar maamle main kii sunwaayee ke dauraan unhone court main kaha tha ki apane sharir par bharatiyon kaa adhikaar bhi sampurna nahin he
 By the way Rohatgi's claim is no surprise
 mahilaon or kai kamjor tabakon ko apni marji ke khilaaf kai tarah kii paabandiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 For example, they should not wear or wear any cloth of their choice, or they may or may not conceive or for whom to conceive or to allow the fetus to live
 mahilaon kii niztaa bhi aksar bahut simit hi rahi he
 Even if freedom of physical privacy is recognized, this recognition is also determined by perceptions of morality and concerns about the family's reputation
 isse niztaa ko lekar jo samaj banati he, vah apane ko dhankane yaa khud ko nijee daayre main samet lene ke adarsh ko tay karti he
 In fact, this belief is so common that when Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde set examples of ancient Indian texts to give his opinion in the Puttaswamy case, they were taking the same form
 jaahir he, niztaa or shaareerik aazaadee, donon hi kabhi bhi bharatiyon ko puri tarah se hasil nahin ho paae hai
 In fact, the most notable thing in Rohatgi's claim was that the government was giving more emphasis to the defense of the Aadhaar scheme
 sarkaar logon kii swaittata or aazaadee ko badhaane ke bajaae khud sarparast bananaa chaahati he
 It is not being said in India itself that people should hand over all their rights to the centralized authorities
 internet udyogon kaa bada kunba—chaahe sthapit antarrashtriya diggaj companiyaan hon yaa phir bhartiya awwal companiyaan yaa start-ap—sabhi yahi chaahate hai ki ham apni swaittata or nirnay lene kii prakriya unako saunp den
 It is also true that the result of companies doing so is not as official
 aakhirkaar, fasebuk yaa flipcart kaa aapaki jindagiyon main us tarah kaa dakhal nahin, jitna sarkaar kaa he
 But the basic spirit of both is the same
 lihaaja, jab digital daayre kii baat aati he to puttaswami faisle kii ek mahatvapurn khami yah he ki vah sibrespes se sambhddha niztaa kii suraksha ko mukhya rup se 'soochna kii niztaa' or 'data suraksha' se judaa masalaa hi maanata he, jaisaa use paaramparik rup se samajha jaataa he
 But this understanding will not suffice because the fine line that remains between our body and its information is slowly disappearing
 masalan aadhaar fingerprint satyaapan main naakaami ke kaaran logon ko rashan dene se inkaar ke baad bhukh se hui maut kii khabaron ko dekha ja saktaa he
 In such cases, failure to match the fingerprint of the Aadhaar database can actually result in death
 isliye aadhaar ke maamle main paaramparik samaj ke aadhaar par mahaj data suraksha ko centre main rakhane se shaareerik aazaadee par ankush ko bhavishya main rokane main kabhi kamyaabi nahin milegi
 This is the reason why the decision of the Aadhaar case is very important
 supreme court aakhri sunwaayee kar rahaa hoga to uskaa faisla na keval niztaa ke adhikaar par upyukt paabandiyon or unki simaaon kaa nirdhaaran karegaa balki yah bhi tay karegaa ki digital daur main hamaari duniya kisi hogi
 Will it be a world in which people's autonomy, decision-making ability and physical independence will be strengthened or will that world be laden with all the systems which will reduce all these things? The year 2018 will give a very important answer to this question

 Elections are won from the vote bank
 orvot bank banataa he jati, dharm or kshetrase
 But the assembly elections going to be held in Delhi are completely different
 ye shaayad desh kaa pehla aisa chunaav he jo samaaj keaarthik muddon par ladaa ja rahaa he
 This election is between the poor of Delhi and the rest of the people
 rajdhani ke garib matadaata majbootee se arvind kejariwal ke saath rahe hai
 But for the rest of the people except him, the 49-day government of Arvind Kejriwal was only a joke
 or jan lokapal vidheyak ko lekar rail bhawan ke baahar dharna ek sarkas, jo kejariwal kii sarkaar chale jane ke baad khatm ho gaya
 And the rest of these people swore that they would never come in the words of Kejriwal, a political pied-piper who claims to have changed the course of politics
 garib tabaka bhi mafalaraman se naakhush tha
 Because the man he had voted with great hope, he, despite being the captain, dropped the government himself
 garibon ke liye wo 49 din khushiyon vaale the
 Electricity and water bills were halved
 police vaale or bijli vaale rishwat maangane se ghabara rahe the
 But the day Kejriwal's government fell, the week started with the poor again
 pichley saal farvari main kejariwal kii sarkaar jis din gai, us din maahaul main bahut niraashaa thi
 There was a lot of anger against the Aam Aadmi Party
 agar aam chunaavon ke fouran baad dilli main chunaav hote to bijepi modi lahar ke sahare yahaan sabakaa safaya kar satta ke shikhar tak panhuch jaati
 But at that time BJP strategists made a big mistake
 unhone ek baar phir se mafalaraman ko kamatar aanka
 He was sure that the delay in the elections in the state would harm the Aam Aadmi Party
 ambani or adani ke khilaaf aaropon ke maamle bijepi ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban gaye
 Whereas BJP wanted to keep Kejriwal's voice quiet on this matter for a long time
 modi kisi ko bhi ye aazaadee nahin dena chaahate the ki jab wo apane achche din laane kaa vaada puraa karne ja rahe hon to koi pareshaani unke raste main aae
 Despite his defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Kejriwal achieved people's sympathy with his principles and right ways and established himself as a leader even in times of trouble
 unhone janata se maafee bhi maangi
 Arvind Kejriwal apologized to the ninety-year-old aunt, to the students, to the sabjiwalas, and to the rickshaw pullers
 jahaan bhi wo gaye sabase baar-baar maafee maangi
 The grief was evident in his voice
 unhen is baat kaa ehsaas tha ki unhone galati kii lekin ab wo kabhi aisa nahin karenge
 From a babu became a social worker and then a real leader
 bhartiya matadaata badi aasaani se maaf kar dete hai
 He had also forgiven Indira Gandhi for imposing emergency and Modi for the Gujarat riots
 to kejariwal kaa gunaah to inke saamne bahut chota he
 bjp's new commander Amit Shah was winning victories in the states of Maharashtra, Haryana, and Jharkhand and showing his strength in Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin kejariwal ne apana kadam dilli ke baahar nahin rakhaa
 And by the time the bjp's Ranbankure returned to Delhi after completing its successful Vijay Yatra, the Aam Aadmi Party made Delhi a big battleground for them
 jab apane paksh main garibon yaa baaki bache logon ko chunane kii baat aati he, to netaa din main to garibon kii baat karte hai lekin raat ko baaki logon kii
 This is especially true in elections
 dilli kii 60 fisadi yani 1
 3 crore people live at Rs 13,500 per month
 ummiido par jeene vaale yahi log is ladaai main kejariwal ke sabase bade samarthak hai
 For two weeks, i have been roaming in remote areas of the capital, which i did not even know about
 garibon kii dilli us dilli se bilkul alag he, jahaan ham rahete hai
 Nizamuddin also has problems for the people, but he does not have an existential crisis
 yaa unki zindagi garibon kii tarah har din kisi kabrgah jaisi jagahon par nahin guzarati
 Just ask the people living in the narrow streets of Ballimaran or the Moti Nagar dwellers living in the filth of the city or the Munirka like village in the middle of the city
 ye sab parivaar samet majbootee ke saath jhaadu thame hue hai
 Modi's vigorous campaign during the general elections set a precedent for future elections
 lekin dilli ke chunaav abhiyaan main bhaajapa kaa ek bhi kadam sahi nahin pad rahaa
 Mistakes are happening one after the other
 kiran bedi ko is chunaav main pasa palat dene ke liye laayaa gaya he
 She is also doing this
 lekin vaise nahin jaisi ummid bhaajapa karti he
 Local BJP leaders are shocked after his candidature
 ve kendriya netaaon ke aage dikhaave ke liye prachaar par nikal rahe hai
 Actually they are depressed and disappointed
 sabhi ko intjaar he netritv ke is faisle ke galat sabit hone kaa
 Bedi was brought to the party on the occasion of n election
 aise main party kaaryakartaaon se unka talmail ban paanaa mumkin nahin he
 His views on many issues differ from the party's views
 iske alaava jis rajya main bhaajapa kaa har netaa apane hisaab se kaam karne kaa aadi ho, vahaan bedi kaa pulisia andaaj or aadchan paidaa kar rahaa he
 i was at a road show with Kiran Bedi in Krishna Nagar
 kareeb sau kaaryakartaaon hi har jagah naach rahe the or pataakhe jalaate hue chal rahe the
 The real common woman was peeping outside the window of her house, but she did not take any interest in this procession
 amit shah ko bahut jald hi is baat kaa ehsaas ho gaya ki dilli bhaajapa ikai aapasi gutbaji main uljhi hui he, chunaav jeetne ke liye yahaan ke netaaon par bharosa nahin kiya saktaa
 So, Amit Shah took command of the Delhi elections
 ek saptaah main unhone itane intervyuu die, jitne ki salbhar main nahin die the
 These included meetings with top party leaders and strategy at the booth level
 unhone puri tarah khud ko isamen jhonk diya
 Ministers of Modi government were given the responsibility of five seats each
 apni kursiyon kii salaamati ke liye saare mantri raat-din khud chunaav abhiyaan ke har pahalu par najar rakh rahe hai
 The RSS is also working to strengthen the party
 odisha, jharkhand or anya rajyon se sangh prachaarkon ko dilli chunaav main bijepi kii madad ke liye bulaayaa gaya he
 An organization parallel to and larger than the party's Delhi unit has been set up
 dilli bijepi ke ghamaasan se tang aa chuke centre netritv ne aise kaaryakartaaon ko prabharee bana diya he jinka chunaav se koi sidhaa taalluk nahin he
 Because of this the bjp's campaign seems weak
 samaantar sanghathan alag se madad karata to dikh rahaa he lekin isaki vajah se chunaav kshetra main votaron ko kanfusion bhi ho rahaa he
 Because it has a large number of outsiders, which the voters of Delhi do not recognize
 ye chunaav bhaajapa or congress ke maujuuda halaat ke bich buniyadi fark bhi saamne le aayaa he
 The Congress party is seeing its worst time
 or party taiyaar he ek or badi haar jhelane ke liye
 But when it seems that the challenges are increasing in BJP, then Amit Shah and his team are making every effort to get the party out of it
 dilli jaise chote rajya ke chunaav main shaayad hi kisi raajnneetik party ne kabhi itane saare sansadhano kaa istemaal kiya ho
 This election is between one man and the entire army
 or yahi bhartiya raajnneeti kii disha tay karegaa
 Here bjp's victory will be seen in connection with Modi's victory
 or shah-modi kii jodi ko aparaajey bana degaa
 But if BJP loses, Modi opponents will get a chance just before the difficult assembly elections in Bihar
 or arvind kejariwal ek aise bade netaa ke taur par ubhar kar saamne aaegein jo 2019 ke aam chunaav main saare vipaksh ke liye modi ke khilaaf ek cheharaa banenge
 All opposition parties will follow him
 khel shuru ho gaya he

 — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)march 10, 2019wishing all political parties and candidates the very best for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 We may belong to different parties but our aim must be the same- the development of India and empowerment of every Indian! - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 10, 2019 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tweeted that people have appealed that elections are a festival of democracy Are, take part in it
 piem ne kaha he ki chunaav ayog ke jo adhikari, suraksha bal desh main chunaav karwaane ja rahe hai unhen unki shubhakamanaayen hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday faced a no-confidence motion for the first time in his 4th reign
 dinabhar kii bahes ke baad bolte hue modi ne vipaksh ke hamale kaa chun-chunakar jawaab diya
 Modi began the 90-minute speech with a no-confidence motion brought by the opposition
 unhone ise loktantr kii mahatvapurn shakti kaa parichaayak bataaya
 Speaking on the motion of no confidence, Prime Minister Modi said that Shiv Bhakti is being talked about these days, i also pray that you should give me so much power that in 2024 you again come with no confidence motion
 meri aapako shubhakamanaayen he
 Let me tell you that on the third day of the monsoon session of Parliament, on Friday, the first no-confidence motion was voted against the government in the Lok Sabha
 is voting main vipaksh ke 126 ke mukaable modi sarkaar ko 325 vot mili
 Let me tell you that the no-confidence motion moved by the TDP MP was approved by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on Wednesday, after which Friday was fixed for discussion
 avishvaas prastaav par bolte hue pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki bhale tidipi ke madhyam se ye prastaav aayaa ho lekin unke saath jude hue kuch mananeey sadasyon ne prastaav kaa samarthan karte hue baaten kahi hai or ek bahut bada varg he jisane virodh karte hue baat kii he
 i think we all should reject this proposal and all of us once again express confidence in the speed with which the government has remained with full majority in the country after thirty years
 'nakaaratmak raajnneeti ne kuch logon ko gher rakhaa'pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki desh ko ye bhi dekhne ko mila he ki kisi nakaaratmakataa he, kaise vikaas ke prati virodh kaa bhav he, kaise nakaaratmak raajnneeti ne kuch logon ko gher kar rakhaa he or un sab kaa cheharaa nikharkar ke saj dhaj kar baahar aayaa he
 Many have a question as to why the no-confidence motion came, neither the number nor the majority
 phir bhi ise laayaa gaya
 And there was such an eagerness to topple the government, so i was surprised why there was talk of stopping it for 48 hours
 charchaa kii jaldi jarurat nahin he, bukamp aa jayega, charchaa kii taiyaari nahin thi to laae kyon
 Modi said that that is why i understand that what was being tried to avoid it also tells what was their preparation
 modi ne congress par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki ye sarkaar kaa floor test nahin balki congress kaa apane tathakthith saathiyon kaa floor test he
 My advice is whenever you have to take the examinations of your potential colleagues, but do not make excuses for the motion of no confidence, as much confidence in the government as you do on the colleagues, Modi said that we are here because we have the numbers party It is a blessing of 125 crore countrymen
 'avishvaas congress kii fitrat'modi ne kaha ki ye avishvaas ek congress kii fitrat he
 The Congress misused the constitutional system of no-confidence motion to create instability in the country
 hamane akhbaar main padhaa ki turant baad bayaan diya gaya ki koun kahata he hamaare paas number nahin hai
 i would like to remind the House that in 1999, there was a statement in front of Rashtrapati Bhavan that we have 272 numbers and are going to join and dropped Atal ji's government by just one vote but the claim of 272 itself was hollow and Elections were imposed on the country
 'janadesh ko asthir karne kaa khel khelaa ja rahaa'modi ne kaha ki aaj phir ek sthir janadesh ko asthir karne kaa khel khelaa ja rahaa he
 Politics has been the tendency of the self-centered Congress through instability
 1979 main choudhary charan singh ko pehle samarthan kaa bhram diya phir waapas le liya
 What can be more insulting to a worker, farmer
 chandrashekhar kaa bhi isi tarah apmaan kiya gaya
 The same formula was adopted in 1997
 pehle devgauda ko apamaanit kiya gaya
 Then Gujral's turn came
 kya devgauda hon, kya mulaayam singh yadav hon
 Who can forget what the Congress did to these people
 jameen se uthe ye janata dalon ko congress ne na sirf chalaa he, balki desh ko asthirataa main dhakela he

 Till then Mirza Ghalib's discussions were in every street of Delhi
 badshaah salaamat unhen sunanaa pasand karte the lekin zuk ko shahi kavi hone ke naate alag rutaba hasil tha
 It is said that for this reason there was a figure of 36 in Zouk and Ghalib
 ek din gaalib bazaar main baithe jua khel rahe the tabhi vahi se zuk kaa kaafila niklaa
 Ghalib taunted and said, 'it is Shah's grudge, it is a fall
 ' is par zuk aag babula ho uthe par unhone apni palki se utarkar gaalib ke munh laganaa thik na samajha
 He complained to King Salamat
 badshaah ne gaalib ko darbar main pesh hone ko kaha
 Well, Galib attended
 darbar main saare shahi darbari maujuud the
 The Emperor asked Ghalib if Mian Zouk's complaint was justified? Ghalib cleverly said that what Zouk heard is the place of his new Ghazal
 is par badshaah salaamat ne gaalib ko lage-haath puri ghazal pesh karne kaa hukum de daalaa
 Then what was left
 gaalib ne apni jeb se ek kagaz kaa tukdaa nikaala, use kuch pal tak ghuraa, or uske baad nikali ye kaaljayi ghazal:har ek baat pe kehete ho tum ki tu kya haitumhiin kaho ki ye andaaze-guftagu kya hain sholay main ye karishma, na barq main ye adaakoi bataao ki wo shokhe-tund-ku kya hanidhan15 farvari 1869 ko duniya rukhsat ho gaye the
