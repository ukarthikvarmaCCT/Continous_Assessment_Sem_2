 The bugle has been blown for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 rajya main saat charnon main voting hogi or 11 march ko chunaav ke nattejey ghoshit honge
 At present, if we look at the political situation of this biggest state of the country, then the competition seems more triangular in which Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party are working hard to repeat the history of the last assembly elections, then the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Lok Sabha elections-2014 It is the hope of historical success, on the basis of which it is trying to end its exile from state power
 sapa ke saamne antarkalah se ubarne kii chunautisamajawaadee party ain chunaav ke maukey par do faad ho gai he
 On one side is its national president Mulayam Singh Yadav and state president Shivpal Singh Yadav, on the other hand is Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav who has removed his father and uncle from his post by calling a special session
 philhal donon kheme party ke naam or uske chunaav chihn par kabje kii ladaai lard rahe hai or jab tak is jhagade kaa faisla nahin hota tab tak uski chunavi taiyaariyaan lataki rahengi
 The big question is whether the party will be able to repeat its performance of the last election? BJP is looking for the CM candidate
 The Bharatiya Janata Party is busy in the preparations of UP and so far according to the indications from the party that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in these elections He will be its star campaigner
 party ne apane candidet kii list bhi abhi jari nahin kii he lekin pradhanmantri modi kii reliyon se usne apane paksh main maahaul bananaa shuru kar diya he
 Its performance in the last two assembly elections was very poor but the party had created history by winning 73 out of 80 seats in the Lok Sabha elections and now its emphasis is on repeating the same results in the assembly elections but the biggest weakness of the party is that its There is no such face that he can field against Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati
 haal hi main hue kuch opinian pole main bhi bijepi ke sambhavit siem candidet ko janata ne teesri yaa chauthi pasand bataaya tha, jo party ke liye jhatka he
 Sahara Bahujan Samaj Party of Social Engineering to BSP is the main opposition party of the state
 2007 main bahan mayawati ne apane dam par bispi kii sarkaar banaai or paanch saal tak safaltaapurvak chalaai bhi
 The party may have 80 seats at present in the state assembly, but in the 2007 elections, the party won 206 seats in the 403-seat assembly
 mayawati ke saamne sabase badi chunauti apane dalit or muslim voton ko ekajute rakhana he
 The major reason for Behenji's defeat in the 2012 elections was said to be the shifting of Muslim votes to Mulayam's court
 loksabhaa chunaav main bhi dalit vot to maaya ke saath rahaa lekin muslim voton ke bantwaare se unhen ek bhi seat rajya main nahin mili
 Mayawati is constantly signaling to the Muslims that the SP is struggling with infighting, so they are able to compete with the communal forces
 sawaal ye he ki kya muslim unki baat maanenge?gathbandhan ke bharose baithi he congresskisi samay desh or pradesh kii sabase badi party rahi congress upi main durdasha kii shikaar he
 For the last several assembly elections, voters are not giving him any sense

 This time Congress was the first party to start its preparations vigorously

 Rajaram Pal, Rajesh Mishra, Bhagwati Prasad and Imran Masood were tried as vice-presidents to help the OBC, Brahmin, Dalit and Muslim voters respectively
 lekin party ko jald hi jamini hakeekat kaa ahsaas ho gaya or ab wo samaajawaadee party se gathbandhan kii raah dekh rahi he
 The party's efforts have somehow been reduced to an alliance to increase its seats and to participate in power like Bihar

 Romney said Obama has proposed further cuts of $ 500 billion
 unhone kaha, ‘sena ke sambandh main raashtrapati baraak obama kaa record he ki ve kehete kuch hai or karte kuch or hai
 Without being distracted by Romney's attacks, Obama and his team have questioned the tax proposals being levied by the Republican candidate Romney on the middle class, alleging that Romney's real plans would harm the middle class
 obama ne apane twit main javaabi hamalaa bolaa or kaha, ‘denwar main diye apane bhaashan main romany ne america logon ke liye purv sharton ke saath kar prastaavon par apni yojanaon ko yaa to galat dhang se bataaya yaa puraa byora dene se manaa kar diya
 This was because their real plans would harm the middle class

 purv bhartiya cricket captain anil kumble kaa maananaa he ki bharat kaa spin vibhaag stareey gendbaajon se bharaa he, or unhone team main vaapasi karne vaale of-spinner harbhajan singh ko 'desh ke sarvshereshth spinneron' main se ek qaraar diya
 Ravichandran Ashwin and Pragyan Ojha played well in the absence of Harbhajan Singh, who returned to the team during the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka
 harbhajan ko kharaab form ke kaaran lambe samay tak team se baahar rahanaa padaa tha
 Kumble, the third highest bowler in the world with 619 wickets in Test cricket, said that Harbhajan Singh is an excellent bowler
 unhone saath hi kaha ki aswin kaaphi dhairyavan gendbaaj he, jo dabaav main pradarshan karne ke liye ahm he
 Former captain Kumble also believes that leg-spinners Amit Mishra, Rahul Sharma and Piyush Chawla should also get enough opportunities
 desh ke pramukh spinneron ke bare main baat karte hue kumble ne kaha ki aswin, harbhajan or ojha kaa spin gendbaaji akraman kaaphi majboot he
 Kumble said, if you do not give enough opportunities to the spinner, you will never know about his true potential
 philhal spin vibhaag kaaphi majboot he, kyonki do spinner (aswin or ojha) maujuud hai, jo maidan par acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 "there is also Harbhajan Singh who has experience of 400 Test wickets and is very competitive," Kumble told the BCCI official website
 jab vah apni sarvshereshth form main lautega to aapke paas team main teen achche spinner ho jaaenge or iske alaava teen leg spinner team main jagah banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Kumble said that Harbhajan can still contribute a lot to the national team
 unhone kaha, vah behtareen he
 He has lost a bit of confidence and the only way to achieve this is to be a part of the team and play more and more matches
 usne pehle bhi aisa kiya he or mujhe koi kaaran najar nahin aata ki vah dobaaraa aisa nahin kar saktaa
 Certainly i think Bhajji is still one of the best spinners in India and with time he will bowl his best
 kumble ne bataaya ki aakhir kyon yah nahin kaha janaa chahie ki harbhajan ne haal main test cricket main kharaab pradarshan kiya he
 "I don't think he has fared poorly in Test matches," he said

 Harbhajan had to stay out of the team for a long time due to poor form
 test cricket main 619 wicket ke saath duniya ke tisare saphaltam gendbaaj kumble ne kaha ki harbhajan singh behtareen gendbaaj he
 He also said that Ashwin is a very patient bowler, which is important for performing under pressure
 purv captain kumble kaa saath hi maananaa he ki leg spinner amit mishra, rahul sharma or piyush chawla ko bhi paryaapt maukey milane chahie
 Talking about the country's leading spinners, Kumble said that the spin bowling attack of Ashwin, Harbhajan and Ojha is very strong
 kumble ne kaha, agar aap spinner ko paryaapt maukey nahin doge to aapako uski asli kshamta ke bare main kabhi pataa nahin chalegaa
 The spin department is quite strong at the moment, as there are two spinners (ashwin and Ojha) who are doing well on the field
 kumble ne bisisiai kii aadhikarik website se kaha, harbhajan singh bhi maujuud hai, jinhen 400 test wicket hasil karne kaa anubhav he or jo kaaphi pratispardhi he

 nishchit taur par mujhe lagata he ki bhajji ab bhi bharat ke sarvshereshth spinneron main se ek he or samay ke saath vah apni sarvshereshth gendbaaji karne lagegaa
 Kumble explained why it should not be said that Harbhajan has done poorly in Test cricket recently
 unhone kaha, mujhe nahin lagata ki test maichon main usne kharaab pradarshan kiya he
 In fact, he played a lot of matches outside India
 bharat ke baahar spinner hameshaa akraman karne kaa vikalp nahin hota

 ek anya match main lakshya kaa peechha karte samay maine 60 ran banaae the
 Whenever i landed in the fifth order to bat in these matches, the team needed 150–160 runs to win and it was necessary that i play a good innings and play the role of finisher

 pandya ke team se baahar hone ke kaaran shankar ko mauka mila lekin unhen is baat kii parvaah nahin
 He said that i am not thinking about the World Cup and other things
 jab aap aisi bate sochate hai to khul kar nahin khel sakate

 In the bridge, Modi compared Inamdar to the mythological bridge built by Lord Rama for Sri Lanka
 inaamdaar kaa 1984 main nidhan ho gaya tha
 The then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee also established his identity as the first worker from Sangh pracharak to Prime Minister by paying homage to this veteran worker of the Sangh

 The life story of Guru and Shishyamodi is very unique
 gujarat ke vadedgar kasbe main chaay bechney vaale damodaradaas modi ke ziddee or majboot iraade vaale is putr ne apni lagan or kadi mehnat ke dam par pehle sangh or phir bijepi main kad hasil kiya
 You would think that Modi took inspiration only from the bronze statues of Sardar Patel and the calendars of Swami Vivekananda
 lekin vakil sahab kahalaane vaale inaamdaar kaa zikr aane par kahani main terning point aa jaataa he
 According to Seshadri Chari, a member of the bjp's national executive, "narendra Modi spent his early years in the Sangh and the lawyer was the greatest influence on him
 ’’ inamdaar kii jeevanakatha sahit modi kii chaar pustakon ke prakaashak prabhaat kumaar kaa kahana tha ki ‘‘modi apane puure vyaktitv kaa shrey vakil sahab ko dete hai

" 1943 se gujarat main niyukt inaamdaar sangh ke praant prachaarak the jo nagar-nagar ghumkar ladakon ko shakhaon main aane ke liye protsaahit karte the
 When he addressed the meetings in Vadnagar in fluent Gujarati, Modi was fascinated by the eloquence of his future guru
 modi ne 2008 main inaamdaar sahit sangh kii 16 mahaan hastiyon kii aatmakatha kaa sankalan jyotipunj prakashit karavaaya tha
 In it he wrote, "vakil saheb had the skill to explain his words to his listeners with the help of examples of daily life

 Andy Marino, author of the April book Narendra Modi: a Political Biography, believes that Modi's increasing focus on the Sangh and his closeness to the lawyer was also the reason for his confrontation with father Damodardas
 marino ne likhaa he, ‘‘akasar pita apane putron ko apane asar se baahar bada hote dekhte hai or kabhi-kabhi prem sambandhon kii vajah se tanaav ho jaataa he
 When another person starts replacing the father and especially when a locally known personality like Vakil Saheb starts taking the place, the injury can get deeper and the father may feel that he has no utility and is emotionally hurt
 Can be deep

 Modi left home in 1968 to escape his marriage

 Inamdar is one of the many eminent personalities of the association

 Inamdar, a man of modest stature, always wore a white dhoti-kurta

 He was fond of playing kabaddi and kho-kho in his youth but later kept himself healthy with pranayama

 But behind this plain face was a rigid organization producer and networker
 1972 main unhone aupchaarik rup se narendra bhai modi ko sangh kaa prachaarak bana diya
 Inamdar, like his father, had by then persuaded Modi to enroll him for his BA degree
 unhone kaha, ‘‘narendra bhai, ishwar ne tumhen kai gun uphaar main die hai, tum aage kyon nahin padhate?’’ vakil sahab ne apane shishy ko dilli uniwarsity ke course kii saamagree laakar di

 Laxmanrao's only surviving 85-year-old sibling Gajanan Inamdar has retired from Ahmedabad Electric Company

 After the Emergency was declared in 1975, Modi's life took a turn
 sangh par pratibandh lag gaya or deshbhar main police ne uske kaaryakartaaon ko dhar dabocha
 Inamdar and his disciple Modi went underground (underground)
 unhone agle kuch maheene bhes badalakar bitaye
 Inamdar started wearing kurta-pajama instead of dhoti-kurta
 modi ne do bhes dhaaran kiye, ek sikh kaa or ek sanyasi kaa, taaki police ko chakma de saken
 Like other Sangh activists, they lived in the houses of well-wishers of the Sangh, making it difficult for the police to catch them
 apatkaal ke dauraan bhi sangh ko jinda rakhane kii modi kii koshishon ne unke jivan ko nai gati di
 After that they went up the stairs one by one in the Sangh

 Kishore Makwana says Inamdar's contribution is more than that
 "modi has inherited the lawyer's organizational skills, public contact, thousands of names and the ability to remember even the smallest thing
" ’’modi ke paas maujuud sabase keemtee chizon main unke guru kii diariyaan bhi hai
 Inamdar kept writing in his daily experience diary for decades

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in an interview that he is an theist

 Gaur said that these people are like clowns of circus
 babulal gaur ne kaha, 'aap' jokaron kii party he
 Everyone's bail will be forfeited
 joker jaise train main aate hai, film main
 at the circus
 usamen baith gaye local train bombai main
 He said that such a party is like a water bubble and Kejriwal is a copy of Digvijay Singh
 babulal gaur ne kaha, 'kejariwal digvijay singh kii duusari copy hai
 He does not have supporters
 hawa-hawa he
 You are abusing the media
 jail bhej denge
 All right when promoting for you
 media khari-khari par aa jaataa he to aap jail bhej denge
 These are not parties
 ye bulbule hote hai
 On Kejriwal's state visit in the first week of April, Gaur said that we will not do anything but just watch the fun and will also provide security
 bhopal seat ke bare gaur ne daawey se kaha ki adwani bhopal se nahin apni hi puraani seat se ladenge
 Babulal Gaur said, 'advani ji has talked to KPA, he is not fighting from here

 conot place kitna surakshit he?padhie ajtak kii exclusive report:-conot place se ek maheene main mahilaon ke saath chhedchhad kii do ghatnaayen saamne aa chuki hai
 On Saturday, it was too much when the accused started masturbating in front of the female professor standing on the roof of an office , he also molested the female professor and ran away by snatching her mobile
 is ghatana ko beete 24 ghante bhi nahin hue hai or conot place par ajtak kii team ne shanivaar or ravivaar kii darmiyaani raat jo kuch dekha, use jaanakar aapke rongte khadey ho jaaenge
 Connaught Place has a significant number of bars

 Closes until 30 pm, but the occupants of drunken, ruckus remain on the streets of Connaught Place all night
 in sabake bich police sirf mookadarshak bani rahati he
 The outer circle of Connaught Place is occupied by eunuchs during the night
 khub chamak damak ke saath saje sanware ye kinnar sadakon par haath hilaate ghoomte rahete hai
 Dressed in state-of-the-art clothes at Connaught Place, these eunuchs are treated as girls and drunken nobles roaming around Connaught Place keep hovering around them
 lekin majaal he ki koi roke-toke
 Now, in this environment, how difficult it can be for a decent person to walk on the streets of Delhi, you can guess yourself
 raat ke kareeb 2 baj chuke hai
 Seeing the front view, i could not understand whether to lower the eyes or to get the edge on my own
 ek kinnar kisi baat par police waalon se buree tarah naaraaz he
 She starts taking off her clothes on the middle road in front of those policemen
 uske saathi use rokane kii koshish karte hai
 But she does not believe
 naaraaz kinnar ne lagbhag apane aadhe kapade utaar bhi die
 She also throws slippers to kill a cop
 police vaale ab bachaav kii mudra main hai
 Policemen, angry with Kinnar's anger, quietly ride in their cars and bikes
 yah sara hangaamaa yun hi chalata rahata he
 Eventually the police have to leave the field
 jate-jate bhi ardhangn kinnar apni naaraazgi jataati he or jor se police vaahan par haath maarthi he
 Aaj Tak's team goes a little further, leaving this ruckus of eunuchs, that the dreaded scene of a cocktail of intoxication and speed appears
 kisi raisajade kii tej raftaar car aniyantrit ho divyder todakar puri tarah andar ghus padi he
 Many boys and girls were inside the car in a drunken state
 nashe main car chalaa rahaa ladkaa mode par gati dhimi karne kii bajaay tej kar baitha or najaara saamne he
 The stunning scenes were not over yet
 thodaa hi aage badhane par nashe main dhut ekanoujvaan police waalon ko dhamkata najar aayaa
 In the inner circle of Connaught Place, this young man was making videos of policemen and they were constantly being threatened
 noujvaan se baat karne par pataa chalaa ki vah austrailian he
 The young man said that he was killed by 15 people together and the policemen were also not helping him
 isi baat par noujvaan pulicekarmiyon kii naukari kha jane kii dhamkee de rahaa tha
 On talking to the policemen, they told that they got there with 3 pcrs on receiving the complaint, but the young man is threatening them instead
 baharhaal police waalon ne media karmiyon ko dekh himmat dikhaai auranshe main dhut ladakebhi thodaa hosh main aa gaye
 These different views of Connaught Place, which is called the heart of Delhi in a single night, will make you think about how courageous someone went through these paths in the night

 Modi said, 'our focus is on giving skills in the hands of youth

 The village is the government of the poor, the farmers and the Dalits
 congress ne desh ko kabhi hisaab nahin diya
 Is conspiring to discredit us
 unke jamaane main yah kahawat mashhoor thi, 'naa khaataa naa bahi, jo (seetaram) kesari kahen wo sahi

 This is the gift of Modi ji
 kaala dhan ek fisadi amir logon ke paas he
 Draw money from the poor, water the rich

 They are shot at resisting
 'rahul ne kaha, 'notebandi fail ho gai he, karadaata pareshaan ho rahe hai
 Demonetisation is an attack on the poor, not against the corrupt
 99 fisadi log notebandi ke khilaaf hai
 It is not 'a surgical strike' but 'fire bombing' on the poor, farmers of India
 piem modi ne amiron ke 10 lakh 10 hajaar karod maaf kiye
 If farmers do not repay the loan then action is taken
 notebandi se kiske khate main 15 lakh rupee aae?
 '5
 piem modi ne notebandi or chunaav sudhaaron kaa zikr kiya to rahul ne maalya kaa mudda uthaaya

 There is also no shortage of cases which were carried out at the behest of the notorious miscreants jailed

 He wanted Brijesh to be a good person by reading and writing, but luck was something else
 27 agast 1984 ko varanasi ke dharhara gaanv main brijesh ke pita ravindra singh kii hatya kar di gai
 This work was done by his political opponents Harihar Singh and Panchu Singh together with his colleagues
 pita kii maut ne brijesh singh ke man main badale kii bhaavana ko janm de diya
 Due to this feeling, Brijesh inadvertently stepped into the world of crime
 brijesh singh ne apane pita kii hatya kaa badla liya, 27 may 1985 ko usne din dahaade apane pita ke hatyare harihar singh ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 This was the first time a case was registered against Brijesh at the police station

 us par bhi is tarah ke iljaam lagate rahe

 Supreme Court to pronounce verdict on Sabarimala was filed today
 Reconsideration petition: Justice Gogoi's Bench will hear verdict After verdict in the Ayodhya case, now the country's highest court will give its final verdict in the Sabarimala case on Thursday
 sabarimala maamle main chif justise ranjan gogoi kii adhyakshata main paanch nyaayamurtiyon kii samvidhan peeth ne farvari main daakhil punarvichaar yachika par bahes puri kar lee thi or apana faisla surakshit kar liya tha, jisko ab saarvajanik kiya jayega
 It will be clear after this decision that the ban on women from ancient times will be restored again or will the new system remain intact? However, in the Ayodhya case, the decision of the special bench of the Supreme Court has given hope to the people, in which the court has said that the court should not interfere in religious rights
 aapako bataa den ki sheersh court ke 2018 ke faisle par punarvichaar kii maang ko lekar kul 65 yachikaayen daayar kii gai thim
 Now the Supreme Court bench will give its verdict on Thursday at 10:30 am

 travnakor devasam board kaa you-turnis maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kerala main sabarimala mandir kaa prabandhan dekhne vaale travnakor devasam board ne 10 se 50 varsh kii mahilaon ke mandir main pravesh ke maamle main you-turn liya tha
 This change of the board was also considered political because of the changed political leadership in Kerala
 board ne apana rukh badalte hue sabhi umr kii mahilaon ko mandir main pravesh dene ke supreme court ke faisle kaa samarthan kiya tha
 The board said in the Supreme Court that the time has not come for any class to be discriminated against on the basis of biological change
 jaivik badlaav ke aadhaar par mahilaon ke saath bhedbhaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Hasbarimalamalaamala? The Supreme Court lifted the ban on entry of women of all ages into the Sabarimala temple
 saath hi kaha tha ki mahilaon ke sabarimala mandir main pravesh par pabandi asanvaidhanik he
 Lord Ayyappa's followers are strongly opposed to this decision
 unka kahana he ki mandir ke bhagwaan ayappa brahmacharee hai or 10 se 50 saal kii mahilaon ke pravesh se mandir kii prakruti badal jaaegi
 When Justice Nariman questioned about this, if a Scheduled Caste woman of 10 to 50 years of age is prevented from entering, will Article 17 apply there
 is par senior edwocket paraasaran kaa jawaab tha ki mandir main pabandi murti kii brahmacharee prakruti ke kaaran he na ki jati ke aadhaar par
 On the other hand, women's organizations and lawyers of the original petitioner opposed the reconsideration petitions
 ab sheersh court is maamle main apana faisla sunaane ja rahaa he
 a total of 64 petitions for reconsideration have been filed in the Sabarimala case
 faisle ke punarvichaar kaa virodh karne vaale kya bole?vahiin, varisht vakil indira jaisingh ne kaha ki bhagwaan mahila purush ke saath koi bhed nahin karte hai
 Advocates of the Kerala government also supported the verdict that denial of women to the temple is not an integral part of Hinduism
 bahut se ayappa mandiron main mahilaayein jaati hai
 There is a difference between the integral part of the religion and the integral part of the customs of the temple
 haalanki unhone mana ki faisle ke baad saamaajik shanti bhang hui thi, lekin kaha ki yah faisle ke punarvichaar kaa aadhaar nahin ho sakati
 These five judges will hear the verdict? The Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, RF Nariman, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra have heard the review petition filed in the Sabarimala case
 isse pehle 28 sitambar 2018 ko supreme court kii paanch nyaayamurtiyon kii samvidhan peeth ne sabarimala maamle main 4:1 se apana faisla sunaaya tha or sabhi umr kii mahilaon ko sabarimala mandir main pravesh kii ijaajat di thi
 However, this decision was dissented by Pastis Indu Malhotrane
 pichhali baar supreme court ne apane faisle main kaha tha ki sabarimala mandir main kisi bhi umr kii mahilaon ko pravesh nahin karne dena asanvaidhanik he
 The last time these judges ruled was that last time when the Supreme Court allowed women of all ages to enter the Nesabarimala temple, then the Chief Justice was Deepak Mishra and he was part of the bench
 is baar deepak mishra kii jagah vartmaan chif justise ranjan gogoi faisla sunaane vaali peeth main shaamil hai
 Apart from this, Bench like RF Nariman, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra are also included in this bench

 The ICC World Cup-2011 league matches have ended
 team india quarterfinal main pahunch chuki he
 But is he ready to face the next round of tough challenges
 yah sawaal is team ko itihaas rachataa dekhne kaa sapana paalane vaale har ek deshvasi ko pareshaan kar rahaa he
 In view of this, considering the performance of Team India in league matches, it has tried to conclude on the basis of how much success Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team has in winning the title win? i finished second with nine points
 uske khate main chaar jeet, ek haar or ek taai rahaa
 The matches won won him two points each while the tie won him one point
 is tarah vah da
 Finished second after Africa (10 points)
 da
 India has faced their only defeat so far in this World Cup against Africa
 is group kii talika main england saat ankon ke saath tisare or westeindies chah ankon ke saath chauthe sthaan par rahaa
 Bangladesh also collected six points with three wins but had to look out for a low net run rate
 is group se ireland or netherlands ko bhi baahar kaa rasta dekhnaa padaa
 The Netherlands did not get a single win, while Ireland beat England and the Netherlands to make this World Cup memorable for themselves
 lig maichon kaa daur : bangladesh ke khilaaf : udghaatan mukaable main bharat ne bangladesh ko haraaya tha
 His batting in that match was very good, but the bowlers disappointed
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki 370 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha kar rahi bangladesh kii team 283 ranon tak pahunchane main safal rahi thi
 Bowling has been the weak link of the Indian team since the beginning
 is kaaran gendbaajon ke stareey pradarshan se utani hairaani nahin hui, jitani ho sakati thi
 The reason for this was only the outstanding performance of the batsmen
 is match se bharat ko do ank mili
 Against England: Eight days after the match against Bangladesh, the Indian team faced England
 is match main ballebaajon ne sachin tendulkar ke netritv main ek baar phir acha pradarshan kiya lekin gendbaajon ke kharaab pradarshan or kharaab kshetrarakshan ke kaaran bharat 338 ranon ke bade lakshya ko bhi nahin bachaa laayaa
 Thankfully, he did not lose and the match was tied
 is match se bharat ne ek ank jutaaye
 Against Ireland: Before the match against India, the Ireland team had defeated England
 is kaaran media ne ireland kaa itnaa jabardast hauva kaayam kiya ki team india ko apni taiyaariyon par phir se gaur karnaa padaa
 Fear of defeat forced players to spend more time on the net
 match ke din bharat ne ireland ko apekshaakrit kam score par khadaa kiya lekin ballebaaji ke dauraan vah sangharsh karti najar ai
 At one time, he had lost four wickets for a total of 100 runs
 yuvaraj singh kii naabad ardhshtkeey pari kii badaulat bharat beshak yah match jeetne main safal rahaa lekin is jeet ko prabhaavshaalee haragij nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Against Netherlands: India face Netherlands after Ireland
 aisa laga tha ki bharat yah match bade antar se jitkar net ran rate ko behatar karegaa lekin maidan main hua iske ulat
 India won by five wickets against the group's weakest team, after losing the wickets of their opening big batsmen
 dakshin africa ke khilaaf : netherlands par mili jeet ne bharat ke khate main saat ank daal die the
 Due to these points, the Indian captain announced at the beginning of the March 11 press conference that his team had reached the quarter-finals
 group main ankon ke sameekaran or aage aane vaali haar se bekhbar dhoni aatmavishvaas se bharpoor najar aae lekin unka aatmavishvaas agle din hi kafoor ho gaya, jab da
 His team lost by three wickets against Africa
 sachin tendulkar ke 49wein ekadivasiy shatak ke baavjood bharat 300 ranon kaa aankada nahin paar kar sakaa
 India lost the wickets of their nine batsmen at 29 runs interval in this match
 is sthiti ne bhartiya ballebaaji kram kii pole khol di
 The group's equation was disturbed: England's defeat at the hands of Bangladesh on 11 March upset the group 'B' equation
 ab bangladesh bhi quarterfinal kii daud main shaamil ho chukaa tha
 He stamped it after defeating the Netherlands
 bharat ke liye yah asaamaanya sthiti thi
 England beat the West Indies to seven points and equalized with India but were lagging slightly behind in terms of net run rate
 bharat ke liye yahi ummid kii kiran thi
 Bangladesh and The in Mirpur
 africa ke bich hue mukaable se is group ke bhagya kaa faisla hona tha
 West Indies, England and India would have entered the quarterfinals in the face of Bangladesh's defeat
 hua bhi yahi
 Playing on their home ground, Bangladesh's team collapsed for 78 runs
 is tarah bharat, england or westeindies quarterfinal main pahunch gaye
 India's final league match: India faced the West Indies in their final league match on Sunday on Holi
 is match main bharat ne kharaab shuruyaat ke baavjood acchhee vaapasi kii or 300 kaa score hasil karata dikh rahaa tha lekin 50 ran ke antaraal par saat wicket ganvaane se uski yah muraad dhari kii dhari rah gai
 It was clear after his performance that losing nine wickets for 29 runs in Nagpur was no exception
 ballebaajon ke niraashajanak pradarshan ke baad gendbaajon ne shuruaati 30 overon main niraash kiya lekin jahir khan dwaara dvon smith ko bold karne ke saath hi bhartiya team urja se bhar gai
 After this, all the mariners took advantage of this opportunity and took wickets and India managed to win the match by a margin of 80 runs
 team india ke pradarshan kaa akalan : chah maichon ke postmortem se saaf ho gaya he ki lig str par team india ke pradarshan main sthayitv kii kami saaf taur par dikhi
 His performance did not show the stagnation that this group had
 afrika yaa phir group 'e' main pakistan yaa phir srilanka ke pradarshan main najar aayaa
 The weak link of the team remained weak and the strength which was reversed, also saw a dent
 kuch ballebaajon ne apni pratibha ke saath nyaay kiya lekin yusuf pathan jaise match jitau khilaadi buree tarah flop rahe
 Quarterfinal match: India will take on Australia on 24 March in Ahmedabad
 abhyaay match main beshak bharat ne australia ko haraaya tha lekin beete ek maheene main australia ne shandaar tarakkee kii he
 His performance is once again visible
 antim group match main pakistan ke haathon mili haar ke baavjood australiya kii saakh kam nahin hui he
 For this reason, India will have to overcome their weaknesses in these three days to defeat them, as well as to burn the oxygen of confidence in the batsmen called their strong side
 kya hai kamiyaan : sabase pehle gendbaaji, phir madhyakram kii ballebaaji, kareebi kshetrarakshan or phir captain ke kuch anbujh faisle
 It is meaningless for India to have a dream of reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup without removing these shortcomings
 captain dhoni ko apane vyavhaar or soch main lacheelaapan laate hue sarvamaanya team sangyojan par vichaar karnaa hoga
 In the second (2nd odi) ODI between India and Australia (australia Vs Australia), Australia scored 298 runs while batting first
 shaun marsh (shaun Marsh) ne 131 ran kii shandaar pari kheli
 Bhuvi (bhuvneshwar Kumar) took 4 and Mohammed Shami took 3 wickets
 is match main sabase zyada ran mohammad shiraj (mohammed Siraj) ne lutaae
 He conceded 76 runs in 10 overs
 mohammad siraaj ne vanade main debyue kiya he
 He has scored the most runs while playing the first ODI against Australia
 bharat kii taraf se khelte hue wo aise debyue khilaadi hai jinhone vanade main sabase zyada ran lutaae
 The most special in the match was the stumping of MS Dhoni (MS Dhoni)
 jiskaa video soshal media par viral ho rahaa he
 With this, he has also done a deed
 emes dhoni (MS Dhoni) ne rabindra jadeja (ravindra Jadeja) kii gend par sabase zyada vanade main stampings kii hai
 He stumped 18 times with the ball of Ravindra Jadeja
 pehle number par harbhajan singh hai
 He has done 19 stumpings off Bhajji's ball
 ek stamping karke wo pehle sthaan par pahunch jaaenge
 Peter Handscomb was batting brilliantly
 jadeja kii gend ko peter samaj nahin paae or beet ho gaye
 The ball came straight to Dhoni (MS Dhoni) and he cleverly stomped Peter
 jiskaa video kaaphi viral ho rahaa he

 finch (6) kaa kharaab form is match main bhi jari rahaa lekin marsh ne vanade kariyar kaa apana saatvaan shatak banaate hue australia ko 300 ran ke behad kareeb pahunchane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 The Indian team has a difficult target of 299 runs to win in the match
 bharat ne is match main khalil ahamed kii jagah mohammad siraaj ko team main sthaan diya tha lekin debyue match main ve bhi behad mahange rahe
 The Indian team is currently 0–1 behind in the three odis series

 dilli main somvaar ko jab badal jamkar barase, to dilli waalon ke liye raahat kii barish bhi afat ban gai
 The reason was also clear, for about two hours it rained heavily, so the roads were flooded
 rajdhani ke baaki hisson kii baat to chhodie, lutian dilli main bhi bura haal ho gaya
 Lutyens Delhi is considered to be very well organized and agencies are also well maintained due to the VIP area, but on Monday the thunderstorm rain opened the doors of everyone

 Water filled on the Mahadev road between the Election Commission office and Akashvani Bhawan and it remained submerged in water till the mouth of Pant Marg
 kai gaadiyaan is pani main funs gayi
 Because of this, the place was jammed
 ashok road par jam hone kii vajah se logon ne mahadev road kaa rukh kiya, lekin yahampani main funs gaye
 On the other hand, the round post office also blocked the road leading to Baba Kharag Singh Marg and Pant Marg

 Because the traffic signals were spoiled in many places due to rain, traffic policemen were also not present to manage the traffic

 It has been the specialty of this region that the royal family has been ruling here for years
 kullu vidhansabha main 1967 ke baad se ab tak hue 11 vidhansabha chunaav main congress ne chah baar baaji maari he, jisamen se akele chaar baar 1985, 1990, 1998 or 2003 main raaj kishan goud ne congress kaa is seat par pracham laharaaya tha
 After Raj, Congress has not been able to grab this seat for the last decade
 jabaki bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne teen baar 1982, 1993 or 2007 main is seat par kabja jamaaya tha
 Apart from this, once the Janata Party and once the Himachal Lokhit Party have won

 Maheshwar Singh, the sitting MLA on the Kullu assembly and a leader of the royal family, is considered one of the masters of regional politics
 68 varshiya singh ne 1972 main kullu nagar palika kaa sadsy ban apane raajnneetik kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 After which he joined the Janata Party and became the General Secretary of the Janata Party's Legislative Party
 singh do baar pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh kaa pad sambhaal chuke hai or teen baar bhaajapa ke binar tale saansad rahe hai
 But due to opposition to the policies of the party, he said goodbye to the party and formed his new party Himachal Lokhit Party and won the assembly seat from Kullu in 2012 and defeated the BJP and the Congress
 tippaniyan The BJP observed Maheshwar seeing its roots weakening and it also saw its impact
 chunaav se pehle hi himachal lokhit party kaa bhaajapa main vilay ho gaya or ab maheshwar bhaajapa ke tikat se kullu seat par bataur ummidavaar maidan main utre hai
 At the same time, the Congress has fielded Surendra Singh Thakur against Maheshwar Singh
 congress ke varisht netaa sundar singh thakur duusari baar maheshwar singh ke khilaaf chunaav ladane ja rahe hai
 The Congress has been away from the Kullu Assembly for the last decade, so the party is trying to find lost land with the help of Thakur in the Rajput dominated areas
 iske alaava rashtriya aaazaad manch kii ummidavaar renuka dogra or nirdaleey ummidavaar camel kaant sharma chunavi maidan main taal thok rahe hai

 kullu vidhansabha par maujuuda vidhayak or raaj parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaale netaa maheshwar singh kshetreey raajnneeti ke mahaarathiyon main se ek gine jate hai
 Singh, 68, started his political career in 1972 by becoming a member of the Kullu Municipality
 jiske baad ve janata party main shaamil ho gaye or janata party ke vidhayak dal ke mahasachiv bane
 Singh has held the post of state BJP president twice and has been an MP under the BJP banner three times
 lekin party kii nitiyon ke virodh ke chalate unhone party ko alavida kah diya or apni nai party himachal lokhit party kaa gathan kiya or 2012 main kullu se vidhansabha seat par jeet darj kar bhaajapa or congress ko sakate main daal diya
 The comments bhaajapa ne apni jaden kamjor hoti dekh maheshwar ko manaaya or iskaa asar bhi dekhne ko mila
 Even before the elections, Himachal Lokhit Party merged with the BJP and now Maheshwar is contesting on the Kullu seat from the BJP ticket
 vahiin, congress ne maheshwar singh ke khilaaf surendra singh thakur ko maidan main utaara he
 Senior Congress leader Sundar Singh Thakur is going to contest against Maheshwar Singh for the second time
 congress pichley ek dashak se kullu vidhansabha se dur rahi he aise main party rajput bahul kshetra main thakur ke sahare apni khoi jameen talashne main juty he
 Apart from this, Rashtriya Azad Manch candidate Renuka Dogra and Independent candidate Kamal Kant Sharma are tapping the electoral fray
 rajput bahul kshetra hone or raaj parivaar kaa dabadabaa hone ke kaaran kullu vidhansabha seat viipi siton main shumaar he
 On one hand, while there are veteran leaders of the royal family, on the other hand, the Congress is trying to improve its decade-old record
 pahari rajya himachal main 9 november ko matdaan hona he or matganana 18 disambar ko hogi
 The BJP observed Maheshwar seeing its roots weakening and it also saw its impact

 Just think, what if antibiotics that show immediate effect in diseases like meningitis and pneumonia are fake? Obviously, can be made on the life of the patient
 par nakli dawaaon ke saudagaron ko isaki parvaah kahaan
 As a last hope to save a dying patient, if these medicines are found cheaper outside the cooperative shops of the hospital, then obviously the patient will benefit
 lekin baahar sasti kaise?jodhpur main jab siidi ko mubir ke madhyam se isaki bhanak lagi to usne police ayukta bhupendra kumaar dak se sampark saadhaa
 Initially, the police did not even get the case that how expensive injections of medicines considered a panacea were cheap at outside shops? The Dak asked the Deputy Commissioners of Police of East and West Regions, Rahul Prakash and Ajaypal Lamba, to investigate this
 police ne aam graahak ke taur par bazaar main dawaaon kii alag-alag dukaanon se mero-sul or mero-sidi (meropenum-salt) naam ke injection kharide
 Seeing the address of the company that made them, they were called
 raper par himachal pradesh ke sonal kshetra kii jis company kaa naam likhaa tha, usne is tarah kii davaaiyaan banane se saaf inkaar kar diya or kaha ki uske naam se dawa bana rahe logon par vah mukadmaa darj karaayegi
 Now the police was ready to take a big step
 lekin aise maamle main uske paas dhokhadhadi kaa cese darj karne ke alaava koi adhikaar hi nahin
 Further clauses may be added only after the investigation report of the Drug Controller Organization
 khayr, dhokhadhadi ke maamle main police ne jodhpur shahar ke hoseller tansukh vadera ko dharaa or uski form nakoda medicals main kareeb 1,000 injection jabt kar dukaan ko sil kar diya
 Manoj Joshi was caught by the police late at night on the spotlight of Wadera
 rahul prakaash bataate he, 'huek ko giraftaar kiya to itane main mache hadakamp ke baad baaki 2-3 holsellers ne davaaiyaan gaayab kar deen
 But it cannot be denied that these medicines are sold in huge quantities in Jodhpur
 '' mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke gruhakshetra main nakli jivan rakshak dawaaiyon kaa yah ghinauna khel do saal se chal rahaa tha
 Further story related to Wadera: He bought these medicines from Rajesh Purohit of Jodhpur
 rajesh or uske sahyogi narendra choudhary or manoj joshi nakoda medicals par davaaiyaan pahunchaate the
 Wadera later supplied them to other shops in the city
 vadera ke alaava do or dukandaar pakad main aa chuke hai, jinke yahaan se police ne sample kharide the
 Chief leader Rajesh Purohit is still absconding
 jodhpur kaa hi rajesh pehle medical riprogentative (emr) tha
 Apart from the specifics of the drug market, he also knew that the more profitable drugs sell them all after being thrown into the market
 aushadhi niyantrak mahakme kii kamajoriyon kaa bhi use andaja tha
 Taking out all the mathematics, he jumped into this conspiracy
 sutara bataate hai ki rajesh ye davaaiyaan indore main banavaata tha or jaipur main chhapavaaye gaye raper chipkaakar unhen 'original' bana detaa tha
 For two years, these medicines were being sold as Sanjivani through two-three wholesalers in Jodhpur alone
 rahul prakaash bataate hai, ''rajesh kii giraftaar ke baad hi puri kahani khul paaegi
 Look at the drug control department, which monitors the circulation of medicines in the market
 sahaayak aushadhi niyantrak ashok bhandari badi bebaaki se bataate hai, ''nakli injection ke bare main police se soochna mili
 Medicines are sent for examination
 hamaare mahakme ko bhi rajesh kii giraftaar kaa intjaar he
 "after the case of fungal glucose, it is now imperative to raise a finger on the drug control department with fake life-saving medicines
 lekin jodhpur main yah mahakama puri tarah pangu bana hua he
 "there are four posts of drug inspector and all four are vacant," Bhandari admits
 ''nakli jeevanarakshak davaaiyaan sarkari aspataalon main bhi khub bikin
 Through the cooperative consumer wholesale shops in the three major hospitals of the city - Mahatma Gandhi Hospital, Umaid Hospital and Mathuradas Hospital - these medicines reached the patients and also sold
 jodhpur sahakaari upabhokta holcel bhandar ke mahaprabandhak bhavani singh kaviya bataate hai, ''hamaare paas shikaayatein aati thim ki mero-sidi or mero-sul naam ke injection baahar kii dukaanon par saste main milte hai
 In such a situation, we contacted Wadera
 usne kaha ki bade paimaane par kharidne se ye injection saste padenge
 Co-operative consumer wholesale stores purchased 825 injections of mero-cd and 100 of mero-sul
 '' inke nakli hone kaa khulaasa hone tak upabhokta bhandar kii dukaanon se bhi mero-sidi ke 82 or mero-sul ke 44 injection marijon ko lag chuke the
 Quickly, the remaining injections of consumer stores were returned to the respective wholesaler
 jodhpur main holcel kii 30 dukaane hai
 According to Kavia, medicines were being taken from Nakoda firm for consumer stores for last 7-8 years

 It is noted that the maximum price on these injections is Rs 400
 se 3,000 ru

 main bik rahe the
 With the MRP getting higher, shopkeepers would rate their faces and earn more money
 alag-alag keemat hone ke bare main poocha jaataa to ve alag-alag companiyon ke hone kaa tark dete
 Significantly, there are rows of shoppers who buy medicines at shops like the open cooperative consumer store in the government hospital
 kaviya khud maan rahe hai ki in dukaanon kii marfat nakli jivan rakshak injection marijon tak pahunche hai
 These injections are rarely supplied in government hospitals for free
 jodhpur ke mahatma gandhi aspataal ke adheekshak pi
 C
 vyas maanate hai ki aise main marijon ko baahar kii dukaanon se bhi is tarah ke injection kharidne padate hai
 According to doctors, when patients do not recover from ordinary antibiotics, then an attempt is made to protect them from these expensive injections
 in injectionon ko doctoron kaa antim hathiyaar kaha jaataa he
 According to a doctor, for the last few days, there were also complaints of meropenam injection being less effective
 nijee aspataalon main bhi ye injection bike hi honge
 But what has happened to the health services of Jodhpur? Who has seen them? In this homeland of Gehlot, the Gandhian Chief Minister, accidents are happening and they are oblivious on the lines of 'don't look bad, don't think bad, don't say bad'
 prasutaaon kii mauton ke maamle ke baad bhi na to swasthya vibhaag cheta or na mukhyamantri
 There were then cases of fungal glucose transfusions to patients

 But after that, a patient admitted to ICU in a big hospital here got a dog
 ab jivan rakshak mahangi or nakli davaaiyaan asli kii shakl main usee jodhpur main jamkar bikati pakadi gayi

 The BJP and JDU, which are part of the ruling coalition NDA in Bihar, have said that RBD Devi's ticket from two places in the list of candidates released by the RJD for the assembly elections has stung the confidence of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri or bhaajapa chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke adhyaksh susheel kumaar modi ne kaha, ‘purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ko do vidhansabha kshetron raghopur or sonpur se tikat dekar rajd ne apni haar sweekaar kar lee he
 The senior BJP leader said that when Lalu too predicts defeat, he himself contests from two places
 2009 main sampann loksabhaa chunaav kaa hawala dete hue modi ne kaha ki lalu ukt chunaav main patliputra or saaran sansadeey kshetra se khadey hue the jisamen se ek main unki kathith taur par sharmnaak haar hui jabaki duusare sansadeey kshetra saaran se vah bahut mushkil se chunaav jeet paye
 He said that in the 2005 assembly elections, there was a close fight between former state Chief Minister Rabri Devi and JDU candidate Satish Kumar in Raghopur and Rabri defeated jdu's Kumar by more than 5200 votes
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri or bhaajapa ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne asann bihar vidhansabha chunaav main sonpur vidhansabha kshetra se rajd pratyaashee kii nishchit taur par haar hone kaa daawa karte hue kaha ki bhaajapa ne yahaan rajd ke khilaaf jameen se jude netaa vijay kumaar singh ko apana pratyaashee banaaya he
 It is noteworthy that RJD supremo Lalu Prasad on Monday released a list of 60 candidates of his party for the elections to the third and fourth phase of Bihar assembly, in which his wife Rabri Devi announced to contest from two assembly constituencies Raghopur and Sonpur
 rajg ke duusare ghatak dal jadyu ne bhi bhaajapa kii tarah rajd ko aade haath lete hue kaha ki lalu prasad hataasha ke shikaar ho gayi hai or unka vishwaas dagamagaa gaya he
 JDU spokesman Shambhunath said that giving tickets to Rabri Devi at two places means that Lalu does not trust the public
 apane nijee swaarth ke liye vah samarpit kaaryakartaaon kii bali chadhaane main bhi sankoch nahin kar rahe hai
 He claimed that this time the public will reject Lalu in the assembly elections
 odisha ke koraput main raily ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki aap sabhi janata jarnadan kaa aashirwad lene ke liye aapkaa ye chaukeedaar aapke bich aayaa he
 He said that just two days ago, Odisha has become a witness to such a historic achievement, which has made the whole world aware of the power of India

 nitish kii thode he
 He taunted that Nitish is busy with morality and busy in conversation with conscience
 jai ho chuha sarkaar kii
 Explain that in Bihar, rats were previously convicted of disappearing from liquor police stations recovered in the raid, now only mice are being blamed for bringing flood-like ravages
 nitish kumaar ke jal sansaadhan mantri ne kaha ki, "chuhon ke kaaran hi tatbandh kamjor ho gaye, tut gaye or baadh aa gai
 "thousands of tons of liquor missing - Rats responsible; Thousands died in floods - Rats responsible! These rats go unnoticed in Nitish's government sacrifice!" - Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd) September 1, 2017 Nitish's minister blames mice for flood Resources Minister Lallan Singh says that rats have played the biggest role in weakening the embankment
 unhone media ke saamne kaha ki tatbandh par rahane vaale gramin vahiin machaan banaakar anaaj rakh dete hai or phir chuuhe tatbandh main hi apane rahane ke liye bill (ghar) bana lete hai, jisase tatbandh kamjor ho jaataa he
 What will be the solution of mice and mosquitoes! He said that leakage occurred at one or two places, but within 72 hours the government fixed it
 itnaa hi nahin, aapadaa prabandhan vibhaag ke mantri dineshchandra yadav ne kaha, "ab chuhon or machharon kaa kya upaay he? aap kya kar lijiega? yah to chalata hi rahegaa
 "he continued," the embankments leaked at one or two places, which the department immediately closed
 yah to koi nahin kah saktaa ki sabhi chuhon ko khatm kar lenge
 "'matter stronger than government in Bihar' Opposition also got an opportunity to target the government on the statements of these two ministers
 rajd ke varisht netaa or purv vittamantri abdul baari siddiki ne chutki lete hue kaha, "bihar main ab chuuhe sarkaar se bhi zyada taqatvar ho gaye hai
 "hand over the Gaddis: Siddiquisiddiqui did not stop here, he said taunting the government's cleanliness," If the rats of Bihar are so powerful then why not hand them over
 bihar sarkaar philhal apni naak or kaan bachaakar rakhe, ye chuuhe kahin wo bhi na kaat len
 "more than 500 people died in the floods a day before a police officer gave a clarification that the rats are drunk in the police stations when the quantity of liquor seized was low
 uske baad mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne thanon or godaamon main rakhi sharaab ko nasht karne kaa aadesh diya tha

 film kaa naam- kaashi: in search of gangadiarector: dhiraj kumarstar cast: sharaman joshi, aishwarya divaan, govind namdev,akhilendra mishra, kranti prakaash jha, parithosh treepathi, manoj joshi, manoj paahvivadhi: 2 ghanta 03 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 1 stallbhinetashraman joshichuninda filmein karte hai
 This time he has selected the film Kashi
 pichley dinon puure desh ke alag-alag shaharon main ek ladki ke gaayab hone ke posters ne kai sawalia nishaan uthaa die the ki aakhirarkaar wo ladki koun he
 However, he was the campaign for the film
 film relies ho chuki he
 Let's know how this film is made after all
 kahanefilm kii kahani varanasi besd he, jahaan kaa rahane vaala kaashi (sharaman joshi ) he 
 She is home to parents and sister Ganga (priyanka Singh)
 lakhanu se jarnlist devina (aishwarya divaan) varanasi apane research ke liye aati hai or unki mulaakaat kaashi se hoti he
 The twist in the story comes when Kashi's sister Ganga suddenly goes missing
 uski talash main kaashi ko alag alag shaharon main bhatakana padataa he
 Between them, there is the entry of local minister Balwant (govind Namdev) and other characters
 aakhirkaar ganga kaise gumshuda ho gai he
 What happens to him in sabhi baton kaa pataa aapako film dekhakar hi chal paaegaa
 Weak Links: The film's weak link is its story, direction and screenplay
 bahut hi ubad-khabad kahani he
 No character can impress you
 mudda acha tha, lekin ek acchhee film banate banate rah gai
 There is a song in the entire film every tenth minute, which further messes up its story
 jaise-jaise kahani aage badhati he, darshak ke taur par aapke jahan main ye baat chalane lagati he kii aakhirkaar ye film khatm kab hogi
 The selection of characters was also quite lax
 lag rahaa tha puri film kaa jimmaa sirf sharaman ke kandhon par he, jitna paisa alag-alag tarah ke gaanon main lagaaya gaya
 If he was put in search of good actors, the film would have looked better
 yahaan tak kii senior actors jaise akhilendra mishra, govind namdev bhi apni kshamta se kaaphi kamjor abhinay karte hue dikhaai de rahe the
 This film is very disappointing
 kyon dekhen film?film kaa becoground score acha he
 It also has a couple of good songs, which you can listen to on the Internet
 yadi aap sharaman joshi ke bahut bade diwane hai to yah film jab bhi tivi par aae, us samay ek baar jarur dekh lijiega
 With the box office promotion, the budget of the film seems to be around 8-10 crores and its release will also be good
 lekin badhai ho, bazaar, andhaadhun jaisi filmein pehle se hi chal rahi hai
 Between them, it will be very difficult to perform well at the box office

 somvaar ke kaarobaari satr main bhartiya share bazaar ke pramukh suchakank sensex or nifti record oonchai par band hue
 The Sensex gained 135 points to 37691 and the Nifty gained 26 points to end at 11387
 bhartiya share bazaar har roj nae shikhar bana rahe hai
 This boom is being seen in the market at such a time, - when inflation is continuously increasing in the country
 kamjor monsoon or badi hui emspi iske or badhane kii ashanka ko bal dete hai
 - After two consecutive increases in credit policy review, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) made it clear that the phase of hike in interest rates has started
 -kamjor rupaya, jiesti revenu ghatane kii ashanka ghaataa badhane kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 - Trade-war can sometimes spoil the international weather for the stock market
 aise main yah sawaal laazmi he ki tamaam nakaaratmak sanketon ke bich bhi bazaar main is teji kaa kaaran kya he? kya bazaar kii maujuuda teji munafavsuli se pehle antim daur kii kharidari he? yaa phir sensex or nifti nae shikhar banane kii ore agrasar he?in sawaalon ke jawaab par bazaar ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki maujuuda teji ko puure bazaar kii teji nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 This is a boom managing the index on the strength of just a few stocks, which will not be sustainable for long
 share bazaar ke fundamental analist avinaash gorakshkar kehete hai ki bazaar kii maujuuda teji main midcap or smallcap sheyaron main koi kharidari dekhne ko nahin mil rahi he
 The Sensex and Nifty are seen touching new highs every day due to purchases in some stocks (TCS, Reliance Industries) which have high weightage in the index
 avinaash aage kehete he ki bazaar main abhi koi bada sakaaratmak sanket nahin he, jiske bal par bazaar kii teji tikaoo rah sake
 In this case, any small negative signal will also have a profound impact on the market
 masalan, rupye main koi badi giravat, kachche tel kii keemat 75 dollar ke paar nikal janaa, china or america main trade war badhanaa
 Assembly elections will be big triggers
 Avinash believes that the upcoming assembly elections (madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan) will prove to be big triggers for the market
 vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kaa acha pradarshan bazaar ko boost de saktaa he, vahiin iske vipareet rajyon se bijepi kii sarkaar kaa janaa 2019 main bijepi kii sthiti kamjor hone kaa sanket degaa
 This will be a very negative signal for the market
 vidhansabha chunaav se hi darasal bazaar 2019 ke chunaav ko discount karnaa shuru karegaa
 At the same time, market expert Rajesh Sharma also believes that in the current boom in the market, one should avoid any major purchases
 unke mutabik bazaar main yah teji ise munafavsuli ke mafik banane ke liye kii ja rahi he
 The recent sell-off by fund houses is a sign of the rise in some stocks
 rajesh ke mutabik maujuuda str se nifti main 100 se 150 point kii teji or dekhne ko mil sakati he
 After this, the market will reach such a level from which profit-booking can take place
 share bazaar main sidhe nivesh karne vaale nae niveshkon ke liye rajesh kii salaah abhi bazaar main kuch intjaar karne kii he
 Foreign Institutional Investors Selling Foreign Institutional Investors (fiis) have sold about Rs 1000 crore so far in August
 jabaki date market main 2000 karod se zyada kii kharidari hui he
 In April, fiis made a total purchase of Rs 490 crore after selling over 13000 crore in the last three months
 videshi niveshkon kii ore se sust badi kharidari bhi bazaar main kisi badi teji kii sambhaavna ko kamjor karata he
 What to do Investor Arjun Kejriwal, founder and market expert at Kejriwal Research and Investment Services, says that the market is looking at its last phase
 chote stox kaa ekadam se dabl ho janaa, chuninda sheyaron main kharidari ke bal par sensex or nifti kaa nae shikhar bananaa or nae niveshkon ko badi sankhya main bazaar main aana yah bazaar main euphoria banane kaa sanket he
 Kejriwal says that after 15 to 20 sessions of the market, a good correction can be seen
 aise main jin niveshkon ne bazaar main ab tak nivesh nahin kiya he, unhen kuch vakt or intjaar karnaa chahie
 Deals should be made in stocks with strong fundamentals when the market falls
 iske saath saath aise niveshak jo achche munaafe par baithe hai unhen kuch munafavsuli karke nakadi haath main rakhkar achche maukon kaa intjaar karnaa chahie

 But will it happen? Is it possible to stop the mess that is spread in the cash donations to political parties, to know this, Aaj Tak sting the leaders of all the political parties
 is sting ke sansanikhej khulaase aapako hairaan karenge
 In fact, under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, it was not yet necessary to disclose the source of cash of less than twenty thousand rupees and political parties get more than 75 percent of the donations from unknown sources
 2004 se 2015 ke bich hue vidhansabha chunaavon main tamaam raajnneetik dalon ko 2100 karod rupee kaa chanda mila or iskaa 63 fisadi nakad ke rup main liya gaya
 In the last 3 Lok Sabha elections, 44 percent of the money has been taken as cash, but no one wants to give information about how much money the political parties got from where
 alam ye ki kareeb ek hajaar se zyada registerd raajnneetik dal inakam tex ritern file hi nahin karte
 Fighting elections is now a costly deal
 itnaa mahangaa ki beete paanch saal ke dauraan hue chunaav main kareeb 1
 50 lakh crore rupees were spent and only in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, political parties spent more than 30 thousand crores, but the amount of money that political parties donate to contest elections or that the parties take to sustain their existence Fear of giving details
 aaj tak ke reportron ne samaajawaadee party, congress, bijepi, rashtriya lokdal jaisi partiyon ke netaaon se mulaakaat kii or unase mulaakaat kar kaha he ki agar ham party ko das lakh rupee chanda dena chahen to bina pan card ke kaise denge
 These leaders explained the entire game without delay
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone do took kaha ki aazaadee ke baad ajtak kisi adhikari kii raajnneetik dalon kaa account audit karne kii himmat nahin hui
 According to the mathematics he told, sitting on one side of the chair, the leader takes any amount of money from donor with suit boot and then the receipt of the donation of 19000 or 1 xxrep 4 9 is taken
 raajnneetik dal ko bees hajaar se kam kii rakam kaa strot bataanaa nahin hota to use koi dikkat nahin or ye dar kabhi kisi raajnneetik dal ko rahaa nahin ki uskaa koi kaayade se audit ho saktaa he or ho bhi jaae to isliye dar nahin ki raseed to hai hin or ye khel beete kai saal se badastoor chal rahaa he
 Why do political party leaders make a game of making black white or dirty business at every level, how do they benefit if district level leaders bring donations and where are the links of this whole game, these leaders Explained in detail

 Actually, the Election Commission wants to stop taking secret donations of more than two thousand rupees
 chunaav nahin ladane vaale raajnneetik dalon ko iskar se chhot band ho
 Full details of donors should also be kept through coupons
 is disha main sarkaar ne 20 hajaar kii seemaa ko do hajaar kar kaam bhi kiya he lekin sawaal he ki kya is niyam se kuch hoga
 Because the kind of break that politicians have, they will not take time to tear apart the new rules
 sawaal ye he ki kya 2000 rupee chande kii seemaa tay hone ke baad kuch badlaav aayega
 It does not seem to be because politicians who are expert in collecting donations have become so adept in this game that no small rule can spoil their work
 (sting oparation dekhne ke liye video dekhen) The Central Government is continuously expressing its support for bringing petrol and diesel under GST
 haalanki petroleum utpaadon ko jald jiesti ke tahat laane par koi faisla hona mushkil lag rahaa he
 But if Rajeev Kumar, vice-president of policy, believes that this task is not only difficult but impossible
 niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh rajeev kumaar kaa kahana he, ''tel ko jiesti ke daayre main nahin laayaa ja saktaa he
 Because the tax levied by the central and state governments on petrol is about 90 percent at this time
 ''rajeev kumaarane ieenes se baatcheet main kaha, ''mujhe nahin lagata koi bhi rajya itane bade str par apane kar main katautee ke liye taiyaar hoga
 Because under GST, a maximum of 28 per cent GST can be levied
 '' unke mutabik iske liye jiesti kii ek nai pattee banani hogi, jiske liye lambii kavayad kii jarurat hogi
 Rajiv has supported bringing all other things under the new indirect tax system
 unhone kaha ki jo log petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laane kii baat kar rahe hai, unhone abhi is tarah se vichaar nahin kiya he
 He said that a better way to do this would be to first reduce the tax on petroleum products
 yah main kai baar saarvajanik taur par bol chukaa hum
 Rajiv said that it needs to be nationalized
 rajyon ko petrol or dijal par lagane vaala kar ghataana chahie
 2 from the tax on oil to the central government, according to Rajiv
 5 lakh karod rupee kaa rajasav miltaa he
 The state governments also get an income of about two lakh crore rupees
 unhone is par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki isaki bharpai kahaan se karenge
 For this, he said that a solution will be found only by slowly cutting taxes
 kyonki isse arthvyavastha par boj ghatega
 According to Kumar, higher oil prices are similar to a tax on economy
 isliye agar tel kii keemten ghatati hai, to isse aarthik gatividhiyon main bhi sudhaar hoga
 Let us know that from Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, from time to time, he has expressed his support for bringing petrol and diesel under GST
 unke mutabik isse petrol or dijal kii badhati keemton se raahat milegi

 There are many stories about the case of social security pensions (eg, Mangari in the photo)
 ajeeb baat to yah he ki jahaan aadhaar asal main garibon ko chot pahunchaa rahaa he, vahiin sarkaar ise garibon ko "taqatvar banane'' ke aujaar ke taur par pesh kar rahi he
 Even if (just for the sake of argument) assume that Aadhaar plays an important role in bringing the benefits of welfare schemes to the people and also accept the conceptual possibility that there is a synergy between the two rights (of life and privacy)
 Even if the need exists, Justice Chandrachud's 2017 Privacy Judgment overwhelmingly rejects that: "civil and political rights and social Wh-no resistance between the economic rights does not exist
 '' asal main unhone kaha ki inamen se ek-duusare ke liye gaun he, yah vichaar "pehle bhi saamne rakhaa gaya he or dotuk dhang se khaarij kiya ja chukaa he
 "many commentators have argued that the" right to privacy "is aristocratic

 "he says," We also need to make the point that privacy is the privilege of some people
 samaaj main har shaks ghanishthata or swaittata kaa hakdaar he, jinaki hifaazat niztaa karti he
 "right to privacy is the most valuable for the common citizen
" nyaayamurti chandrachud ne vaaki sahi likhaa he ki "baar-baar doharaai jane vaali baat "ki garibon kaa vaasta keval aarthik khushhaali se he'' kaa istemaal itihaas main maanavadhikaron ke sabase ghanghor ulalanghanon ko anjaam dene ke liye kiya gaya
