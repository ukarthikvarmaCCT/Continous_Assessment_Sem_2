 sholay ek aisi film thi, jiskaa har kirdaar aaj bhi logon ke jehan main jinda he
 Especially the character who became a star despite being a villain
 wo kirdaar tha daaku gabbar singh
 Actually Gabbar was not a fictional name but a real bandit
 jisane ek dashak tak chambal main raaj kiya tha
 He had become the biggest headache for the police
 gabbar police waalon se behad nafrat karata tha
 Who was the notorious dacoit of Gabbar Singhchambal, Gabbar Singh alias Gabra was born in 1926 in Dang village of Bhind district
 vah gaanv kaa ek saadhaaran yuvak hua karata tha lekin baad main usne jurm kii duniya kaa rukh kar liya tha
 Gabbar left his home and village in 1955
 or vah us vakt ke charchitadakukalyaan singh gujars ke gang main shaamil ho gaya tha
 Gabbar Singh formed his own gang by joining gang and carried out many incidents
 magar uski dosti kalyaan gujars ke saath juyada dinon tak nahin chali
 Gabbar Singh formed his gang only a few months later
 dhire-dhire uskaa naam chambal kii ghaatiyon main goliyon ke saath gunjane laga tha
 His gang had now become infamous under his name
 gabbar kaa aatankamadhya pradesh ke bihadon main 50 ke dashak main gabbar kaa naam aatank kaa paryaay banataa ja rahaa tha
 People were starting to panic in his name
 police mahakama bhi uski harkaton se pareshaan tha
 He was carrying out serious incidents the day he came
 police ricard main uske naam se maamle badhate ja rahe the
 In Chambal, her name was started to speak
 bhind, gwalior, itawa, dholpur main gabbar kaa itnaa khuf tha ki uske bare main koi baat karne ko bhi taiyaar nahin hota tha
 Gabbar used to cut off people's nose and ears
 a tantrik had told the robber Gabbar Singh that if he would offer 116 cut eyes to his total goddess, then the police or someone else's shot would not spoil him
 yah baat gabbar ke dimag main ghar kar chuki thi
 At that time, the robber Gabbar Singh had vowed to cut the nose ears of 116 people and offer them to the goddess in front of his family
 or uske baad gabbar ne sainkadon logon ke naak kaan kaat daale
 Which included most of the police
 inaamah puure pachaas hajaargabbar ke jurm kii kitaab main har din ek nayaa panna judata ja rahaa tha
 Police of three states including Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh were looking for him
 use pakadana bahut mushkil kaam tha
 For this reason, the police placed a cash reward of Rs 50,000 on the head of the robber Gabbar Singh in that decade of 50s
 us daur main yah bharat main kisi wonted apradhi ke sir par rakhaa gaya sabase bada inaam tha
 Nehru was also troubled and it became difficult for the police to catch Daku Gabbar Singh
 jab jab police or uske giroh kaa aamanaa saamana hota tha
 So the police had to suffer more in the opposite encounter
 us daur main chambal main kareeb 16 gang the lekin daaku gabbar singh kaa gang sab par baari thi
 Jawaharlal Nehru, the then Prime Minister of the country, was also very concerned about the situation of the Chambal and the gang of bandits
 yuva adhikariyon ko mili thi jimmedaareedaku gabbar singh ko lekar desh or pradesh kii sarkarein pareshaan thi
 Everyone wanted his death
 baat 1959 kii he
 An important meeting was planned to eliminate Gabbar
 or use khatm karne kaa zimmaa yuva police adhikari rajendra prasad modi ko saunpa gaya
 Modi was the deputy SP at that time
 unhone usee saal kukhyat dakait putalibai ke khilaaf chalaae gaye oparation main bhi bhagidaari kii thi
 But Gabbar Singh's encounter with IPS officer
 epa
 Rustomji did it
 vah padam vibhushan aword paane vaale ek maatr police officer the
 K
 epa
 Rustomji was also the Chief Security Officer of the then Prime Minister for more than 6 years
 aise maaraa gaya tha gabbar'da british, da bandits and da borderman' ke kitaab ke mutabik november 1959 main dspi modi ko raamacharan naam ke ek gaanvvaale ne gabbar singh ke bare main ahm jaankaree di
 Because Modi once saved the life of his child
 jaankaree milte hi police harakat main aa gai thi
 On November 13, police surrounded Gabbar's hideout
 donon taraf se zabardast golibari hone lagi thi
 DSP Modi wanted to end the operation before nightfall
 wo ladate-ladate gabbar gang ke kaafii kareeb pahunch gaye
 Modi threw two grenades at the bandits and attacked them
 phir bhi daakuon kii taraf se firing jari thi
 a grenade fell to Gabbar Singh and his jaw was badly injured
 kuch der baad chabal kaa aatank daaku gabbar singh maaraa ja chukaa tha
 His entire gang was wiped out by the police
 yah muthbhed logon ke saamne hui thi
 The villagers and passersby were standing on the roof of a train watching the encounter
 aise hi hive par bason kii chhaton par log jamaa the
 Many stories of Kitabaku Gabbar Singh on Gabbar Singh were recorded in the diary of the then IPS officer KF Rustomji
 rustamaji 50 ke dashak main madhya pradesh police ke mahanireekshak the
 Rustomji used to write diary daily
 jise baad main ipies adhikari pivi rajagopal ne ek qitaab kii shakl di
 The name of that book was 'the British, the Bandits and the Bordermen'
 ' rajagopal ne yah kitaab rustamaji kii ijaajat or unhi ke maarg darshan main likhi thi
 In such a 'sholay', the story of Gabbar from the robber Gabbar Singhshole film was different from the story of the real Gabbar
 lekin film ke lekhak saleem khan chabal ke khoonkhaar daaku gabbar singh kii kahani se acchhee tarah waakif the
 The reason for this was that Salim's father was also an officer in Madhya Pradesh Police
 saleem unhi se aae din gabbar ke bare main suna karte the
 While he was writing the story of the film Sholay
 to vahiin se daaku gabbar singh kaa kirdaar unke jehan main aayaa tha

 pashchimi dilli sthit ek plastic kabad bazaar main mangalvaar der raat bhayankar aag lag gayi jisase lakhon kii sampatti jalakar khaak ho gayi

15 pm
 aag par kaabo paane ke liye lagbhag 20 damakal gadiyon ko ghatnasthal par bheja gaya

 The Mumbai Police on Friday raided the premises of former Congress chief Kripashankar Singh
 kripashankar par benami sampatti jamaa karne kaa aarope he
 Kripa Shankar's house and office in suburban Mumbai were raided, a police officer said
 ham jaanch main kaam aa sakane vaale kagajaat khoj rahe hai
 Former Mumbai Congress chief Kripa Shankar faces charges of cheating
 aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main do din purv nagar police dwaara exiaar darj kiye jane ke baad kripashankar ne ucch nyaayalay ke unke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane or unki achal sampatti ko kurk karne ke aadesh ke khilaaf kal ucchtam nyaayalay kii sharan lee
 On February 22, the High Court, while admitting prima facie criminal misconduct against Kripashankar, ordered a case against him
 mukhya nyaayadhish mohit shah or nyaayamurti raushan dalvi kii khand peeth ne kaha ki police upayukta arup patnayak sarkaar se kripashankar singh ke khilaaf bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon ke tahat aapraadhik kadachaar ke liye mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati len
 The role of other defendants (kripa Shankar's family) will also be examined
 peeth ne kaha tha ki patnayak kripashankar or uske parivaar, jinamein uski patni, putr or putravadhu shaamil hai, kii tamaam chal or achal sampati ke sambandh main dastaveji subut jamaa karen
 The family will also be prosecuted for aiding the alleged crime
 adaalat ne kaha ki usne 1970 ke dashak main saadhaaran rup se saarvajanik jivan kii shuruuaat kiah 1998 main vidhayak banane tak usne khaas kuch nahin kamaaya tha
 The court said that it said that as a legislator, he received 45 thousand rupees every month and from that salary he acquired more than a dozen immovable properties
 uski sampatti uski aay ke gyaat strot se kahin zyada he or yah gananaa hamaare hisaab hi nahin balki hamaare vivek ke bhi khilaaf he
 The High Court issued this instruction during the hearing on a PIL filed by activist Sanjay Tiwari

 narendra modi aadhuniktaa ke pravartak hai yaa paramparawaadi? ve pragativaadee hai yaa ateet main ulajh hue hai, chaahe vah ateet kitna hi vaibhavshaalee kyon na ho? kya unki aakanksha bharat ko ujjwal nae bhavishya main le jane kii he yaa sone kii chidipha waapas laane kii he? unke anek anuyaayi in teenon prashnon ke uttar mujhe bataa chuke hai—ve pragativaadee aadhuniktaa ke pravartak hai jo bharat ko sunahare bhavishya main le janaa chaahate hai
 He is a technology enthusiast and an admirer of science
 unhone rajnatik prachaar ke liye soshal media kaa istemaal karne kii prerana obama se lee or use bahut adhik sudhaar liya
 He takes a selfie with his fellow heads of government (referring to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott here) and tweets it
 jab mumbai filmajagat kii shokh abhinetri unase ek foot oonche kad ke saath unke kandhe par jhuk kar selfi leti he to ve bade shahi andaaj main palatakar poochhate hai, ''ho gai?" aise anekanek tareekon se ve rajeev gandhi ke baad bharat ke sabase aadhunik pradhanmantri dikhaai dete hai
 After coming here, we need to do one more question
 kya unki sarkaar main unki apni aadhunik soch jhalkati he yaa vah aresas kii bhootkaal kii soch main dubi he?donon ek saath nahin chal sakate
 Modern thinking means science, technology, an eagerness to unravel hitherto unexplored mysteries, the humility to accept that mankind has yet to touch new horizons, and that what we know right now is the sum of what we do not know
 iske vipareet aresas kii paramparawaadi soch kahati he ki maanav bhavishya main jo kuch khojane, banane yaa kalpana karne kii chahat rakhata he, vah sab vedikakaal main praapt kiya ja chukaa he
 In this case, all we have to do is to study the Vedas, Puranas and Upanishads with an open mind, but in depth
 ham is sabko gavaan baithe kyonki gupt or maury rajwanshon ke patan ke saath hi ngkshahadu samrajya or viraasat chhin-bhinn ho gaye
 Not only that, because of invaders from the West, Muslims and then Christians enslaved us
 at: modi kaa udai, ek sahasrabdi ke ateet main chalaang lagane or usase judye ke liye bharat kaa pehla avasar he
 If you are more observant, then it simply means to turn the clock and calendar in the past
 nai sarkaar jab apane kadam jamaa rahi he tab uthaane ke liye yah ek gambhir mudda he
 The important session of Parliament is beginning
 yah mudda uthaaya janaa chahie kyonki yah ek pramukh mudda he, mahaj deenanath batra viapeeth se nikle snaatak bhakton kii jamaat kaa uthaaya koi shosha nahin he
 It would be foolish to ignore Dinanath Batra as a lonely Deewana and Wendy Doniger's scholar
 batra hamaare rajnatik or bauddhik chintan main nai shakti kaa pratik hai, bhale hi yah puraatan soch kii shakti ho
 His hold on the Bharatiya Janata Party's Ministry of Human Resource Development can be seen clearly
 is saptaah nai dilli main ek nayaa chalan dekha gaya jab german rajdoot maaikel stiner ne batra se milakar kendriya vidyalayon main german bhashaa kii padhai se unka virodh kam karne ke liye tark kiya
 Despite all his diplomatic skills, the victory was Sanskrit
 aise samay main aadhuniktaavaadi pradhanmantri kii taraf se halke-se hastkshep karne kii jarurat thi
 They could have said that what is needed in the Sanskrit vs German dispute? Sanskrit is our best classical language and should be made attractive to everyone and freed from Panditji's belief
 or german hi kyon? bharat ke logon ko french, spanish or maderin sahit anek mahatvapurn videshi bhashaaon main se kisi ko bhi chunane kii chhot honi chahie
 Today the world is global and India is going global
 nehru ke baad modi sabase adhik videsh yatra karne vaale pradhanmantri hai
 Now is not the time to delve into the depths of old trenches of cultural and linguistic insecurity
 aaj kaa yuva bharat desh se nikalakar vaise hi duniya ko gale lagane ko aatur he jaise modi vishwa ke netaaon ko lagaate hai
 (by the way, the Haryana government has decided to seek Batra's advice to modernize the education system)
 yah bahes kisi ek vyakti ke bare main nahin balki maansik avasthaa ke bare main he, jisamen tark ko parampara, jigyaasa ko puraanon se ulajh diya gaya he
 This situation becomes more complicated
 2001 main anek varisht patrakaron ke saath atal bihari vaajapeyi ke kafile main main bhi iran gaya tha
 This journey was useful in every way because we all went to that ancient city named Percypolis which was destroyed by Alexander the Great
 ham sab un khandhiron main gum rahe the tabhi hamaare saath maujuud aresas ke ek bauddhik vichaarak ne hamen itihaas kaa gyaan dena shuru kar diya
 He said that look, how wicked Alexander was
 vah bharat main bhi yahi sab karne aayaa tha
 But he was defeated by the Hindu king Porus, whose real name was Paurusha
 vah dar ke maare bharat se bhaaga, uski sena tahas-nahas ho gai or vah antat: mar gaya
 Then i tried to stop that history is completely different from this, but i was sidelined
 mujhse adhik samajhdaar dost or samrik vishyon ke pandit si
 Rajamohan patted my shoulder and said, don't argue with them, they confuse history with faith
 aaj mujhe unki yah baat aksar yaad aati he
 History in India has long been a political and ideological football
 isliye aap samaj sakate hai ki aresas ke vichaarak vampanthi vichaarkon se badla lene ke liye itane baichaiyn kyon hai
 The leftist thinkers who have been dominating for decades, have filled many secular distortions by taunting their thinking in history
 phir bhi itihaas samajhadaar asahmatiyon or bahes ko jhel saktaa he
 Even though this debate is often meaningless, the Taj Mahal was once a Hindu temple
 magar isse bad chunauti tab khadi hoti he jab itihaas hi nahin, vigyaan ko bhi aasthaa se ulajhaa diya jaataa he
 This complication has inspired my column this week
 pichley saptaah australia gaye modi se zyada surkhiyaan grih mantri rajnath singh ne apane ek bhaashan main yah kahkar bator lee ki bhautik vigyaani vernar hejanberg ne apana prasiddh anischitata kaa siddhant vedon se liya tha
 (it is another matter that some overzealous newsmen in his ministry had not even heard of Heisenberg's name and wrote Eisenhower's theory of uncertainty in a press release)
 yah thodi tedi soch he
 This thinking is similar to the widespread and long-standing mythological thinking that everything the Western world is looking for today was developed in the Vedic period
 bhagwaan ram, sita or lakshmana ke saath puspak vimaan main lanka se ayodhya laute the yani us kaal main bhi hawaii jahaaj the
 Today, if we talk about icbms capable of carrying more than one weapon or Patriot missile stopping enemy missile or Strategic Defense Initiative, what were the power arrows of Ram and Ravana in the war of Lanka? Or what arrows did Arjuna shower on the Kauravas? Ramanand Sagar worked very hard to remind him of this rich heritage in his endless television serials
 isse kya fark padataa he ki aaj ham apane sainikon ke liye ek bharosemand rifl bhi nahin bana pate
 There is no denying that our Vedas, Upanishads and texts like Ramayana and Mahabharata are really ancient and they have amazing imagination and unique knowledge
 ho saktaa he ki hamane masini udaan kii kalpana us samay se bahut pehle kar lee ho, jab hamaare bauddhik pratidwandvi yunaan or rome ke vaasi ikaras se finnics tak insaan par pakshiyon ke bade-bade pankh lagaakar udaan kii kalpana kar rahe the
 It is true that Aryabhata and his disciples conceived, discussed and detailed many astronomical truths and ideas
 inhen sachaaiyon ke liye europe ke kai vidwaanon ko saikadon saal baad jala diya gaya yaa jehar de diya gaya
 Maybe, one has also imagined things like plastic surgery, transplantation of animal organs in humans, stem cell research, surrogacy
 magar yah kahana ki hamaare paas yah sab pehle se tha na sirf haasyaaspad he balki khatarnaak bhi he
 Our country is steeped in traditions and superstitions
 hamaare missile vaigyanik nae agni missile kaa pareekshan karne se pehle puja karte hai or nariyal phodte hai
 Our astronauts take Mangalyaan's blessings to Lord Balaji by taking his model to Tirupati before leaving
 ab agar ham unase ye kahen ki ek sahasrabdi pehle jo kuch hamaare paas tha, ve sirf uski nakal kar rahe hai yaa us ejineering ko palat rahe hai to yah khatarnaak hoga, kyonki unamem se anek is par aapatti bhi nahin karenge
 This is a big challenge for Modi, moving on to the future
 unke paas aadhunik or takneekee dimag he
 But they themselves and the ideological and cultural forces that propel them further are illusions of a glorious past
 pracheen granthon main simati puraagaathaon or aadhunik nai khoj kii talash saath-saath nahin chal sakati
 If Modi needs to learn one thing from Nehru's thinking, then it is scientific reality
 punasch: pune main, aryabhatta ke charnon main-meraa saubhaahgya tha ki pichley saptaah maine kuch ghante professor jayant narlikar ke saath bitaye
 He is still a prominent astrophysicist of India and co-creator of the hoyle-narlikar theory, questioning the big-bang theory
 unhone pune vishvavidhyalay main inter uniwarsity centre for estronomi and estro physics (aiusiee) banwaaya he or unke bagiche main newton, oinstin, galileo or sabase mahatvapurn aryabhatta jaise mahanatam vaigyanikon kii vishaal pratimaayein hai
 Narlikar is counted among the bravest and thickest skinned logicians of India
 76 varsh kii aayu main bhi kisi andhvishwaas or pracheen manyata kaa zikr aate hi unki ankhen damakane lagati hai
 They are most irritated when people forget to understand their science as astrology
 pune kii phone directory main unke santhaan aiusiee ko aam taur par jyotish kaa centre bataaya jaataa he
 To prove his point he told that he collected hundreds of coils of the most talented and successful students and mentally challenged children and gave them to be distributed to the most famous astrologers of India
 unamem se ek bhi sahi pahchaan nahin kar paaya
 Narlikar says that astrology is nonsense and to call it Vedic is messing with the truth
 unka kahana he ki vaidic parampara main koi jyotish nahin tha, koi mangal shaadi kaa amangal nahin karata tha, koi brihaspati krupa nahin barsaata tha or koi shani khel nahin bigaadta tha or use manaane ke liye har shanivaar ko sarson kaa tel or nakadi chadhaane kii bhi koi jarurat nahin thi
 They say that it all came from Greece
 sikandar apane saath apni sena main bahut se gyani bhi laayaa tha

 The Warriors team could have won this match, but due to the failure of their batsmen, they were left behind by 15 runs
 dairedevills ke ranneetikaar bhi yah acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki unki apni majbootee ke kaaran nahin warirs kii kamajori ke kaaran unhen jeet mili he
 In such a situation, the Daredevils team will need to consider their strategy as well as support their senior players, who have consistently failed
 david warner ko chhodkar kisi kaa pradarshan nirantar nahin rahaa he
 Sehwag played a key role in the victory against Mumbai Indians but after that his bat has again become silent

 centre sarkaar ne videshi bainkon main dhan rakhane vaale teen kaarobaariyon ke naam somvaar ko band lipaphe main supreme court ke saamne rakh die
 According to information received from sources, these names are former Dabur director Pradeep Burman, Rajkot businessman Pankaj Chamanlal Lodhia and Goa's mining king Radha Timblue
 centre sarkaar ne court main ek atirikt halafanama daakhil karke ye naam bataae
 The process of action has started against these three in the case of secretly holding money in foreign banks
 kejariwal ne ambani bandhuon par bhi lagayaa tha aropakhatapuri tarah kanoonee: daburkhabar par 'dabar' kii pratikriya bhi saamne ai he
 The company said that this bank account was opened when Pradeep Burman was an NRI and he was legally allowed to open the account
 dabar ne daawa kiya he ki khaataa kholane ke sambandh main saare kanoonee pakshon kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he or uchit tex bhi chukaaya gaya he
 The company has said that it is very unfortunate that every person who has an account abroad is being looked at with the same eyesight
 company ne kaha he ki philhal pradeep burman kaa dabar se koi sambandh nahin he or dabar india limited main koi pad unke paas nahin he
 If Modi has the courage, tell all the names: Congress sources are telling that the evidence is being collected in the cases of leaders who have names in account holders in foreign banks
 is bare main pukhta jaanch ke baad court ke samaksh un naamon kaa khulaasa bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The three names that are coming out now have to prove that the money they have kept in foreign banks is not black money and RBI guidelines in this case have not been disregarded
 teen naam saamne aane ke baad congress ne bijepi par counter atake kiya he
 The Congress has said that this proves Arun Jaitley's claim that he was saying that the Congress will be blushing after the name is revealed
 vahiin party mahasachiv digvijay singh ne kaha he ki agar bijepi, narendra modi or sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat main saahas hai to sabhi kalaadhan dharakon ke naam saarvajanik karen
 It is permissible to have limited money in a foreign bank, it is worth mentioning that the Central Government had earlier said that the names of foreign banks whose accounts have not been started under the Income Tax Law will not be revealed
 sarkaar ko lagata he ki blike mani maamle main avaidhta kii jaanch shuru kiye bina naamon kaa khulaasa karnaa niztaa ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan hoga jisamen arabiai ke niyamon ke mutabik kisi bhi bhartiya ko yah haq he ki vah har saal videshi bank main vaid tareeke se 1 lakh 25 hajaar dollar jamaa kar saktaa he
 On the plea of ram Jethmalani, senior advocate of the Supreme Court, the court had directed the government to set up a high-level task force to bring back Indian money deposited in unscrupulous foreign banks
 court ke aadesh par tab kii upie sarkaar ne jethmalani se un bharatiyon naamon kaa khulaasa kiya tha jinke acount lichatenstin bank main the or german sarkaar ne dohare karadhaan bachaavsamjhaute ke tahat soochna muhaiyaa karai thi
 The government had given the clarification of the agreement earlier
 In this case, the Narendra Modi government had told the Supreme Court in its first affidavit that due to the objections of Germany, it cannot disclose the names of those Indians unless under the financial law against them
 Investigation of irregularity does not begin
 isse pehle naamon kaa khulaasa karne se dwipaksheeya samjhaute kii sharton kaa ulanghan hoga
 It states that the Government of India is engaged in some important double taxation avoidance agreements with other countries including the US
 court ko bataaya gaya he ki in sandhiyon ke madhyam se hi videshi bainkon main jamaa bharatiyon ke blike mani se judi soochnaaon ke strot tak pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 The government had told the court that if we violate the agreements agreements, other countries will refuse to share the data related to the money hidden by Indians in foreign banks
 centre sarkaar ne is halafname ke jariye court ko aashwast kiya he ki vah un bharatiyon ke naamon kaa khulaasa karne ke liye taiyaar he jinke videshi bank khaaton kii jaanch kii sifarish kii gai he
 Jethmalani had strongly objected to this stand of the government
 unhone kaha tha ki sarkaar sab kuch rahasy banaakar rakhana chaahati he
 He had said about the double taxation avoidance agreement that it is a trick to hide everything
 sarkaar ke is faisle kii congress ne bhi ninda kii thi

 yah surang saadhe teraa kilometre lambii hogi
 This tunnel will not only reduce the distance between Sonamarg and Drass but will keep the road between Srinagar and Kargil open despite heavy snowfall in winter
 abhi jojila main baari barfbaari or bhuskhalan ke kaaran sardiyon main sadak band ho jaati he jisase kargil or leh kaa baaki desh se sadak sampark tut jaataa he

 Addressing BJP workers in his constituency Naranpura, Shah said, 'the people of the country have blessed us like Lord Shiva and entrusted us with a huge responsibility
 bijepi kabhi bhi keval jammu kashmir main satta main bane rahane ke liye rashtriya hiton se samjhauta nahin karegi
 'shah said,' The government in Jammu and Kashmir was formed only to resolve the Kashmir issue and i am confident that we will find a solution to this issue
 agar kashmir mudde kaa samaadhaan nahin nikalataa he to koi bhi party kaaryakartaaon ko gathbandhan sarkaar se baahar aane se nahin roak saktaa
 Shah also said that BJP workers should go to the public and give the message that the party will not compromise on national interests
 haalanki bijepi pravaktaa hashard patel ne kaha ki shah ne keval yah kaha tha ki rashtriya hit party kii praathamikta hai or unhone pidipi ke saath bijepi ke gathbandhan ko todane ke bare main unhone spasht rup se kabhi kuch nahin kaha

 rail mantri piyush goyal raipur main railway kii ek rivyuu meeting le rahe the, lekin tabhi aisa kuch hua ki rail mantri asahaj ho gaye or railway ke adhikari balgen jhaankne lage
 Actually, in the middle of the meeting, the light suddenly went off
 itnaa hi nahin disple kaa bhi power cat ho gaya
 Due to the sudden power cut, railway officials started looking into the side
 kareeb pandrah minute tak power cat rahaa
 In this meeting, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal was being told the merits of the upcoming projects of Railways
 lekin achaanak batti gul ho jane se kuch der ke liye railway ke afasar or mantri donon ke liye apriy sthiti paidaa ho gai
 During this time, there was silence in the meeting room
 kai minute tak jab batti nahin lauti toandhere main hi meetingdobaraa shuru hui
 However, after the light came on, everything became normal
 is meeting main raipur ke saansad ramesh bains sahit chhattisgarh sarkaar ke aadha darjan mantri shaamil the
 In this review meeting of the railway, the entire emphasis was on the Dalli Rajhara railway line
 naksali nahin chaahate bane raleve linebstar kii ridh kii haddi maani jane vaali is railway line ke nirmaan mencsli lagaataar rode atka rahehain
 They do not want the expansion of railway facilities in Bastar under any circumstances
 kai baar naksali patariyaan ukhaad chuke hai
 Recently he killed two RPF personnel in Dantewada
 is railway trek par jald hi railway ke 9 nae thane kholane ja rahaa he
 The railway minister's plan to deploy RPF on this entire track was also conveyed
 raipur or bilaspur rail mandal ke aadhunikeekaran, yatri suvidhaon ke vistaar, sawari or malgadiyon kii vistaar yojanaon par railway afasaron ne pregentation diya
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal took a good class of railway officers for bringing new trains and increasing the speed of old trains on the mumbai-howrah railroad
 pregentation ke dauraan hue sawaal jawaab main kai afasar rail mantri ko satusht nahin kar paae
 The social media accounts of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai have been hacked recently
 ab isamen ek or bada naam jud gaya he
 Now the target of hackers is Brennen Eyrib, CEO and Co-founder of virtual reality technology company Oculus
 isse pehle Uber ke travis kalainik or twitor ke dick costolo ke bhi acount hack hue the
 Hacker hacked his Twitter account and wrote in the bio, 'i'm not doing security testing, just laughing'
 iske baad kai tech blog ne iske screenshot le liye
 However, soon his account was restored and all the information was corrected
 iske alaava usne kai or twit kiye jisamen likhaa ki wo ab company ke siio ban gaye hai
 Significantly, Oculus, the maker of virtual reality headsets, has been bought by Facebook and is now a part of Facebook
 philhal na to fasebuk or na hi Oculus kii taraf se is ghatana ke bare main koi jaankaree di gai he
 The surprising thing is that on most such cases, spokespersons of social media companies refrain from saying anything
 aise main ek aam yujar soshal media par apni security kaise sunishchit karegaa
 The big question is also that when the owner of these social media companies offering security and privacy is not secure, then it is difficult for common users not to worry about their security
 arase baad gaushala main khub chahal pahal thi
 Otherwise, desolation was an everyday thing
 gaayen to vahaan aana-janaa kab kaa chhod chuki thim
 Sheep goats and chickens had forgotten the way there
 aaj kii mehfil kuch zyada hi gulzaar thi
 It can be said that there was a lively atmosphere like Animal Farm of George Orwell
 jaanwaron kii apni alag jubaan hoti he jise ve aapas main samaj lete hai
 They also need an interpreter to understand the things of humans and for this they seek the help of Nanhku
 nanhaku gaushala kaa care tekar he jise panchayat ne niyukt kar rakhaa he
 Nanhku spoke to his grandfather about animals and learned how to explain them to him
 ab nanhaku hi gaushala ke jaanwaron ko apadet diya karata he
 That tells what is the big news of the day? And what's trending on Twitter? An emergency meeting was called when Nanhku told him that # beefban was trending on Twitter for number one on day two
 ye gaushala gaanv ke baahar ek khandhar he jiskaa ek sira jangal se sata hua he
 According to Nanhku, in his grandfather's time, nearby animals used to gather there everyday
 tab nanhaku ke dada unhen insaanon ke kisse or raajnneetik gatividhiyon ke bare main bataaya karte the
 The animals were most interested in politics
 ye baat nanhaku ko uske dada ne bataai thi
 Nathu Goat first took the stage
 "bhai maan gaye
 Good days have come for the cows
 " dudhani gaay bhi bheed main baithe baithe muskaraa rahi thi
 At the point of Nathu, he nodded and blinked
 iske baad mittu chuuhe ne sir uthaaya or gardan idhar-udhar ghumaate bolaa, "jab maanjhi jaisaa hi ek insaan apane soobe main order de saktaa he to maanjhi aisa kyon nahin kar sakate the
 For humans, they did everything that they could, even in their dreams, they did not think about us
 ""haa, vaise to bade shaan se bataate the ki unhone bhi khub chuuhe khaae hai," mittu ke paas baithe puttu chuuhe ne joda, "kya insaanon ko khate vakt yaa khaane kii baat par hi hamaari yaad aati he
 Later he forgets them all
 ""jab insaan apano ko hi bhul jate hai to bhala ham jaanwaron ko ummid karnaa to bemaani hi he," mittu ne baat ko aage badhaayaa
 Nathu started again, "brother, it is now completely clear that no one is born with a stamp on this circle
 ye baat jitani insaanon par lagu hoti he utani hi jaanwaron par bhi vaise hi lagu hoti he
 "" It is only humans who, like ourselves, we have distributed to animals
 balki hame to or bura fansaa diya he
 He has drawn at least one streak for himself
 jahaan se khadey hue vahiin se unki line shuru bhi hoti he or kai baar ant bhi ho jaati he," munna murge ne natthu kii baat ko aage badhaayaa
 "they decide which child will be called from which religion and caste
 lekin hamaari jati or dharm to marate vakt tay hoti he
 We do not know what our religion is before we start the knife? "nathu continued Munna's point," We remain secular throughout our lives
 koi nahin poochta yaa phir apni raajnneeti ke liye hamen secular banaae rakhaa jaataa he
 If the knife is halal, then our religion falls apart - and if the knife blows, it gets registered in another religion's account
 "audiens main taadaad sabase zyada to bhedon kii thi
 Still, all of them were sitting quietly
 eks ofishio chairman prasad bhainsa sabha kii adhyakshata kar rahe the
 Kumari buffalo was sitting next to them
 sabase zyada gussa unhen 'aap' or 'ham' se tha
 From AAP, Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal and we ie Jitan Ram Manjhi, leader of Hindustan Awam Morcha
 kejariwal se unhen ummid thi ki jo insaan aam aadmi ke bare main sochataa ho wo jaanwaron ke bare main jarur sochega
 But in the Delhi elections, he was disappointed when he did not show anything worth while eating even one of the 70 AAP manifestos
 isi tarah unhen jithan ram maanjhi ke mukhyamantri banane par ummid jaagi thi ki kam se kam wo unhen mahadaliton main to shaamil karne kaa shasnadesh jari kar hi denge
 When Manjhi too did not do so, his heart broke
 ve bade maayoos hue
 All the animals were listening carefully so the voice of Munna and Natthu was getting louder
 "holi ho, diwali, nayaa saal ho yaa phir jashn kii koi or vajah, katnaa hame hi he
 We have no census
 ho saktaa he hamaare paidaa hone or katane kii taadaad itani zyada he ki sensos kisi ke boote kii baat bhi nahin he
 So in this way we became majority
 lekin alpsankhyak kaa darja to dur ham to dalit category main bhi nahin aate
 "" When Nitish Kumar created the Mahadalit Commission in Bihar, it felt like days would be over
 lekin unhone kuch bhi nahin kiya
 "" What did we expect Manjhi to say
 aisa laga maanjhi ham murgon or bakron ko mahadalit main to shaamil kar hi lenge
 But they were also deceived
 agar maanjhi hamen mahadalit category main daal dete to aglaa mukhyamantri banane se unhen koun roak saktaa tha?""ham to november main maanjhi ke liye hi vot maangate
 Even if we leave aside those who eat weeds, is the number of cock-eaters less? We would sit and perform Giving off a call
 kya kisi kii majaal hoti ki hame nazarandaaj kar de
 If people did not stop, they would have forcibly stopped
 "baat chali ja rahi thi or koi nateeja nahin dikh rahaa tha
 Kalu then stood up and said, "brother, there are countless problems
 Do we have any solution for them? " tetari bakrii ne kaalu kii baat ko endorse kiya
 Finally, a consensus was passed that his party would contest on its own in the elections going to be held in November
 jald hi party kaa ek theth desi naam rakhaa jayega or aupchaarik rup se chunaav ayog ke paas applai kiya jayega
 It was decided that the party name would be kept so that neither the media said 'aap' or 'hum'
 chunaav chihn yaa to insaan ke chehre kaa sketch hoga yaa phir chaaku
 With this, everyone caught their way
 koi gaanv kii ore to koi jangal kii ore
 Dudhni remained sitting there
 use ummid he ki ab gaushala har roj gulzaar rahegi

 The biggest worry for the Indian team on this tour is its bowling

 While the previous tour of England witnessed Tendulkar and Dravid's best innings, the upcoming series could give new Test stars to the country

 Bhopal
 beete salakisaan andolan ke dauraan police ke saath jhadap or firing main 6 kisaanon kii maut hone kii barsi par congress ke kai netaa buudhvaar 6 june ko mandsaur pahunch rahe hai
 The Congress has given full strength to the success of this rally
 mandsaur main do lakh kisaanon kii bheed ke bich rahul gandhi bhaashan denge
 If sources are to be believed, making the issue of martyrdom of farmers on this land of Mandsaur, the Congress will raise an electoral clash in Madhya Pradesh, because assembly elections are to be held in November this year and farmers have started agitating against Shivraj government across the state
 mangalvaar ko bhopal main congress ke pradesh adhyaksh kamalnath or prachaar samiti ke chairman jyotiraditya sindhiya ne mandsaur main hone vaali raily ko sarkaar dwaara kamjor kiye jane ke prayaason kaa aarope madha he, lekin unhone yah bhi kaha, ki ham puri takat se mandsaur pahunchakar kisaanon ke saath khadey hone kaa elaan karenge
 Significantly, on June 6 last year, farmers in Mandsaur were protesting against their demands
 yahaan sarkaar kisaanon kii maangon ko maanane ko taiyaar nahin thi or isi bich police or kisaanon ke bich hui jhadap main 6 kisaanon kii maut ho gai thi
 After this incident, the Shivraj government of Madhya Pradesh came on the back foot
 usne mritak kisaanon ke parijanon ko ek-ek karod rupye muaavja dene kaa bhi elaan kar diya, lekin badi sankhya main kisaan aaj bhi sarkaar ke ravaie se naakhush dikhaai hai
 The Congress wants to change the attitude of farmers before the Assembly elections
 isko lekar uske adhikansh netaaon ne kisaanon ko apane paale main karnaa shuru kar diya he
 On the occasion of the anniversary of the firing in Mandsaur, once again the Congress will try to remind the farmers of the incident that CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan is called their enemy
 congress kaa rashtriya adhyaksh banane ke baad madhya pradesh main bhi rahul gandhi kii yah pehali raily hogi or is raily main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke baad jo unke pramukh nishane par honge vah siem shivaraj singh chouhan hi honge
 Congestion Challenge for Congress: The challenge of Congress is not less about this rally
 darasal madhya pradesh sarkaar ne mandsaur main congress kii raily ko anumati to de di he, lekin vah nahin chaahati ki vahaan pradesh bhar se bheed pahunche
 The Congress has claimed that the rally will reach two lakh people, mostly farmers
 isi ko lekar sarkari str par bhi sakhti kar di gai he
 Jyotiraditya Scindia, president of the Congress Publicity Committee, says that Shivraj Singh Chauhan has engaged police and administration to stop the mob
 har jagah nakebandi kar congress kaaryakartaaon or kisaanon ko mandsaur jane se roka ja rahaa he
 According to state media in-charge Manak Agarwal, police in Indore and Ujjain have stopped and stopped many trains
 congress kaaryakartaaon ko dhamkaaya ja rahaa he, lekin iske baad bhi mandsaur kii raily safal hogi
 No one can throw a bottle at Rahul, so people will not be able to carry a bottle of water in the meeting held on Wednesday in Mandsaur of Parirahul Gandhi

 congress netaa pankaj chaturvedi kaa kahana he ki sabha main aane vaale logon ke liye 5 lakh pani ke paauch, 2 lakh chacha ke paauch or ek lakh zeus ke paauch mangaaye gaye hai
 So that they do not have any problem with the heat

 In view of the tension, the administration did not allow Rahul Gandhi to meet the family of the farmers
 unke mandsaur jile main pravesh par bhi roak laga di thi
 On this, Rahul changed his plan from Udaipur in Rajasthan
 mandsaur tak pahunchane ke liye rahul gandhi ne car or phir bike par kachche raste se safar kiya
 They also walked for about 3 km on foot
 iske baad bhi ve mandsaur nahin pahunch paae the or police ne unhen neemuch main hi hiraasat main le liya tha

 Kanhaiya Kumar, former president of JNU Students' Union, has made serious allegations against him by one of his close ones
 varshon tak kanhaiya ke saath kaam karne vaale or jeenyu campus main unke qareebi maane jane vaale jayant jigyasu ne esef or bhartiya communist party se istifa de diya he
 Along with the resignation, he has accused Kanhaiya of being racist, ruining the organization on the JNU campus and lying on Kanhaiya
 apane istife kii ghoshnaa karte hue jayant ne fesabook post main ek patr bhi share kiya he, jo unhone communist party of india ke mahasachiv, sudhakar reddy ke naam likhaa he
 Jayanta writes in the second paragraph of his letter, 'there is a complete pattern in comrade, organization and party that the exploited-marginalized-deprived-depressed-oppressed people are treated as bonded laborers
 jhanda koi dhota he, netaa koi or banataa he
 'photo credit: Jayant (facebook) In this letter written in the name of Sudhakar Reddy, Jayant has not only attacked Kanhaiya, but has also questioned the working methods of the Communist Party of India
 wo apane patr main likhte hai, ‘aaj bhi party kisi dalit ko apana mahasachiv banane main itnaa kyon sakuchaati-sharmaati he, yah bhi samaj se pare he
 D
 on the occasion of every important event, all party meeting, opposition gathering
 raja nazar aate hai, vah rashtriya sachiv hai, magar wo party ko chalaa saken, us apekshit vivek kaa darshan party unamem kyon nahin kar paa rahi he
 Jayant becomes very strict while writing about Kanhaiya
 wo kanhaiya par jativaadee hone kaa aarope lagaate hai
 He accuses the organization of ruining the organization at the JNU campus and also accuses Kanhaiya Kumar of lying
 soshal media par share kiye apane patr main jayant likhte hai, ‘dalit-pichde-adivasee-akliyat kinhin ke bhi netritv main kaam kar lete hai, magar tathakthith ucch jatiyon ke logon ko pichde-dalit-adivasee kaa netritv sahaj bhav se sweekaarya nahin he
 There are so many layers of humiliation that where there is to be avoided, to fight
 ’yahaan saafe he ki ishaara kanhaiya kumaar kii taraf he
 But after this, Jayant attacks directly with the name of Kanhaiya
 unke mutabik, ‘jo bhi log jeenyu main chunaav lard lete hai, wo khud ko ascharyajanak dhang se sanghathan kii gatividhiyon se kinaaraa kar lete hai
 Somewhere there is a cast aerogens and somewhere a class aerogens
 mujhe aapke saath hui ek baithak yaad he jisamen commered kanhaiya ne kaha ki main jeenyu esef unit kaa hissaa nahin hum
 'he further writes,' The person with whom the entire JNU and the progressive and socially judicial faction of the country stood together against the excesses, the same Kanhaiya betrayed the JNU student community
 ’apane patr main jayant jigyasu ne kanhaiya kumaar or puri party par kai aarope lagaae hai
 But what is written at the end of the letter is very shocking
 wo likhte hai, ‘commered, maujuuda halaat main jabaki ‘gyani-dhyani’ logon ne puure tantra ko hijac kar rakhaa he, puraa sanghathan van main sho banakar rah gaya he, shakti-santulan ke naam par mujhe dhamkee dilwaai gai, in gundon se meri jaan par khatara he, bahut ghutan kaa maahaul he
 'while resigning from his post, the allegations made by Jayant on Kanhaiya are very serious
 khabar likhe jane tak kanhaiya kii taraf se koi pratikriya nahin ai he
 Finally, understand what the pair of janant-kanhaiya means
 campus main jayant or kanhaiya kii jodi vaise hi thi jaise, sholay film main jai or viru kii thi or raajnneeti main modi or amit shah kii he

 If Sajid Khan had accepted that offer of Hirani, then there would have been some other Munnabhai, usually nobody would even think of messing with Salman

 It is also said that Sajid Khan and Jacqueline's breakup happened due to increasing proximity with Salman Khan

 Nitish was elected as the party's president after a national executive meeting in Parliament Annexe on Sunday
 nitish kaa jediu pramukh bananaa pehle hi tay ho gaya tha
 Earlier, there was a meeting of party leaders at Sharad Yadav's house, in which apart from Sharad Yadav, all the big leaders of the party including KC Tyagi, RCP Singh were present
 sharad yadav rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main bolte-bolte bhavuk ho gaye the or unke aansu chhalak pade the
 Three-time JDU president Sharad Yadav had already made it clear that he would not take up this responsibility for the fourth time

 On the question of his role in JDU, he said that this party will decide
 yadav ne kaha, 'ham koi is party ke chalate desh kii raajnneeti main nahin hai

 Sharad Yadav, a three-time JDU president, has completed three consecutive terms as party president
 unhone ab party ke samvidhan main koi sanshodhan karaane se inkaar kiya he, kyonki iske baad hi unhen agle kaarykaal ke liye chunaa ja saktaa tha

 When Union Health Minister Drs
 harshavardhan 16 june ko mujffarpur ke shri krishna medical college and hospital (eskeems) kii pediatric intensive care unit ke ward number 3 main medical reportein dekhte hue doctoron se baat kar rahe the, usee vakt 4 varshiya nisha ne dam tod diya
 Doctors tried to save him, but he did not return his breath
 vah bihar ke mujffarpur main us din acute anseflitis syndrome (eies) se hone vaali maut main se ek thi
 It is also being called 'chhami fever'
 rajya main isse ab tak 150 se zyada bacchon kii jaan ja chuki he
 In SKMCH, the hands of many children suffering from AES have hit their hands
 ve apni ankhen kahin tikaa nahin paa rahe or kai to na bol paa rahe hai, na hi ankhen khol paa rahe hai
 They also suffer from light, sound and touch
 aspataal bacchon or unke parijanon kii hridayavidarak pidaa se gunj rahaa he
 At the time when Nisha's parents were roaring in tears, Harsh Vardhan, along with Union Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey and Bihar's Health Minister Mangal Pandey, started asking the families of other sick children that the arrangements in the hospital were okay Whether or not usee dauraan usee ward main ek or 5 varshiya bacchee nitu kii bhi maut ho gai
 The horrors of the situation were revealed by the two deaths within minutes and it shocked Harshvardhan
 vahaan ke doctor bhi asahaay najar aa rahe the
 Till now the cause of the disease has not been known and the doctors were not in a position to do anything other than treat the symptoms that emerged from the disease
 peedit bacchon kii sankhya dinodin badhati rahi jisase nipatna vahaan tainaat thode-se doctoron ke liye kathin tha
 In fact, the lack of preparedness of the central and state government to deal with such situations of helplessness is also seen
 harshavardhan ke liye bihar kii yah pehali yatra nahin thi
 He also visited Muzaffarpur in June 2014, when the state was in the grip of this disease
 tab bataur kendriya swasthya mantri harshavardhan ne eskeems main 100 bistaron ke pediatric isiu ke nirmaan kaa vaada kiya tha
 He had announced the construction of a 10-bed pediatric ICU in the neighboring districts and setting up Biological Diagnostics Laboratories in Bhagalpur, Bettiah, Gaya, Pavapuri and Nalanda
 is baar mujffarpur ke daure ke baad bhi harshavardhan vahi vaade doharaate najar aae
 Apparently, his 2014 promise to establish a 100-bed pediatric ICU and five biologic diagnostics laboratories did not materialize
 philhal, eskeems main 50 bistar vaala pediatric isiu he
 The hospital's main ICU has also been converted for use by the Department of Pediatrics
 lekin ye donon ikaiyaan alag-alag manjilon par hai jisase unki nigaraanee kar paanaa mushkil he
 Says a doctor at SKMCH, "with 100-bed icus on the same floor, conditions would have been slightly better
 lekin ham puure nahin hue vaadon ke bare main kya kah sakate hai?'' adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki peediton main zyaadaatar bacchon kii umr 10 saal se kam thi or unki mrityu hypoglaysemia ke kaaran hui jisamen blad sugar kaa str bahut gir jaataa he or sharir main electrolites kaa asantulan ho jaataa he
 The mysterious disease must have been unified to eliminate the disease and its causes, which killed a large number of children over a certain period of time
 lekin bihar main aisa hota najar nahin aayaa
 The Muzaffarpur district first appeared in 1994 and since then, the disease that hunted malnourished children with low immunity every year has not been identified so far
 rajya ke swasthya adhikariyon ke liye yah rog rahasyamay bana hua he
 They do not know conclusively whether this is Japanese encephalitis transmitted from animals to humans by mosquitoes, or another encephalitis that spreads through contaminated water
 yaa phir, yah lichi khaane se hone vaala saadhaaran hypoglaysemia he jisamen rakt main glucose kaa str saamaanya se neeche chalaa jaataa he
 Children suffering from the disease arrive at the hospital with symptoms of fever and tremors where they go into a coma and then die rapidly
 chrishchiyan medical college, vellore ke epidemyologist tii
 Jacob John visited Bihar in 2013 to investigate Muzaffarpur cases
 unhone paaya ki is beemaari kaa sambandh kuposhit bacchon se he
 John is of the opinion that malnourished children often fall prey to hypoglycemia as they often fall asleep without eating food at night and remain hungry for a long time
 medical visheshgyon ke ek samooh kaa maananaa he ki iskaa sambandh khaali pet lichi khaane se bhi he
 Actually, Muzaffarpur district is also famous for producing litchi
 indira gandhi institute of medical sciensej, patna ke purv dean (shodh) tathaa bhartiya chikitsa anusandhan parishad, patna ke purv vaigyanik dow
 Prabhat Kumar Sinha says, "lychee contains MCPG toxins that inhibit the transmission of glucose in the body
 kuposhit bacchon ke liver (jigar) main surakshit glicogen kii maatra bahut kam hoti he jiske kaaran unka sharir liver main maujuud glicogen kaa upyog nahin kar paata
 The brain needs glucose for energy, but these children do not have it in their bodies because they ate litchi on the night before getting sick
 glucose ke str main achaanak giravat se unhen daure yaa jatke aane lagate hai or kai maamalon main maut ho jaati he
 '' Nevertheless, Dr
 prabhaat kehete hai ki eies ke kaarnon main lichi ke alaava anya kaaran bhi ho sakate hai
 "this requires more intensive evidence-based research," he explains
 hamaare saamne aise bhi maamle aae hai jinamein eies se peedit bacchon ne lichi nahin khai thi
 It can be caused by a virus and no vaccine can be made to prevent it unless it is known which the virus is
 '' ab tak visheshgyon ne mutr ke namoonon se lekar ridh or mastishk main upasthit cerebrospinal kraluid tathaa anuvanshik adhyayanon se yah pataa lagane kii koshish kii he ki mujffarpur ke bachche kisi vishaanu se peedit hai yaa kisi vish se yaa phir kuposhan ke kaaran ve iskaa shikaar banate hai
 More than 500 children suffering from this disease are currently being treated at SKMCH and Kejriwal Nursing Homes in Muzaffarpur
 peedit bachche tej bukhaar or kanpakanpi ke lakshanon ke aadhaar par bhartee kiye gaye hai
 Every year poor children fall prey to it
 bacchon ke abhibhavakon kii garibi ne unhen iskaa shikaar banane kii gunjaaish badhaai he, kyonki unamem se zyaadaatar bachche uchit bhojan kii kami or kuposhit hone kii vajah se hatyare vishaanu ke aage kamjor pad jate hai
 Their poverty has perhaps given the authorities a chance to evade the attitude and avoid being subjected to any punishment even after not knowing the cause of the disease in two decades
 mujffarpur ke ek varisht doctor ne in lakshanon ko glucose kii gambhir kami se jodate hue kaha ki yah garmi or umas main or teji se prabhavi hoti he
 "when the disease spreads in the summer months, the doctors start treating the patients and they forget it as the weather changes
" unhen is beemaari kaa dhyaan phir agali garmiyon main hi aata he jab yah rog ek phir se hamalaa kar detaa he
 "even worse, because the cause of this disease is not known, the health authorities do nothing to prevent it
" yah mahamari kaa rup le chuki he, par isamen hastkshep ke naam par sirf beemaari hone ke baad kii dekhbhaal ho paa rahi he
 Failed Health Department This time when the crisis of encephalitis was spreading, state Health Minister Mangal Pandey went to Canada to address a conference
 yah dikhaata he ki unki praathamiktaayen kitni galat thim or eies ke khatre ko lekar ve kitne udasin or laaparvaah the
 Such is the attitude of his department
 jaahir he, swasthya vibhaag ke adhikari bacchon kii maut ko rokane main kai staron par asafal hue hai
 a group of medical experts believe that even though the exact cause of AES is not well known, its definitive treatment may not be available, yet little vision and quick measures can cause glucose in the body to cause the death of many children The lack of it could have been easily prevented
 chah saal pehle yah pataa chalaa tha ki din main lichi khaakar raat main bina khaanaa khaae sone vaale kuposhit bachche agali subah biimaar pad jate hai
 In 2014, doctors saved 74 percent of the sick children 'lives by a simple remedy — they offered 10 percent dextrose within four hours to sick children
 sarkaar is disha main pehle se sakriy rahi hoti to is saal bacchon ke abhibhavakon ko beemaari kii rokthaam kii ranneeti ke bare main aasaani se jaagruk karte hue sunishchit kiya ja saktaa tha ki koi baccha raat main bina khaanaa khaae na so paae
 Another group of doctors say that due to the busy election of politicians and bureaucrats, the awareness campaign did not go unnoticed
 kab lagegi lagameskeems main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke daure ke agle din 19 june ko is 'dimagi bukhaar' se chaar or bacchon kii maut ke saath hi maut kaa aankada 112 ho gaya
 The disease has affected 222 development blocks in 12 districts of the state
 prabhavit jilon main khaas taur par mujffarpur , vaishali, shivahar or purvi chaparan shaamil hai
 So far, 534 AES cases have been registered in Muzaffarpur
 unamem se 383 kaa eskeems main or 152 kaa ilaaj kejariwal aspataal main chal rahaa he
 56 patients of AES and 2 patients of Japanese encephalitis have been identified in the last 20 days in East Champaran
 unamem se eies ke 19 bacchon kii maut ho chuki he
 Public health experts have repeatedly warned in the past decade that poor civil and public healthcare infrastructure, malnutrition and disease detection and delay in treatment are the major factors contributing to deaths from AES
 lekin ab tak isko lekar koi sudhaar nahin kiya gaya
 During his visit to Muzaffarpur, Nitish Kumar also held a review meeting with doctors and health officials and directed senior officials to increase the capacity of SKMCH from 600 to 2,500 beds
 unhone adhikariyon ko eskeems ke pediatric isiu main bistaron kii sankhya doguni karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 a total of 31 pediatricians are employed in SKMCH, while eight other specialists are to come from other hospitals

 Lalan Chaudhary, who holds the BPL card, and Hridayanand Chaudhary, who works in the post of Khalasi in Railways, have donated property to the family of RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav
 lalu kii beti ko daan main mili karodon kii jameenhaalanki in donon main bahut samanthaayen bhi he
 Both of them donated their land on the same day i
e
 13 February 2014 to Hema, the fifth daughter of RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav
 donon ke daan patr par hema yadav kaa pataa rabari devi kasarkari awaas10 circular road kaa pataa ankit he
 Both are also witnesses to each other's donations
 yahi nahin donon ne ek hi din 29 march 2008 ko jameen kharidi
 This was revealed by senior BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi
 susheel modi ne saadhaa lalu par nishanaajatak se khaas baatcheet karne hue unhone kaha ki ek bipiel cardedhari jisko indira awaas aavantit hua tha, usne hema yadav ko jameen daan di thi or abhi maamla aayaa ki ek railway kaa khalasi hridayanand choudhary ne bhi 62 lakh kii zamin hema yadav ko daan main de diya tha
 It is fortunate for Bihar that the BPL card holder in the state of lalu-nitish also has wealth of crores and not only property but also so much money that these people have the ability to donate crores of property and free of cost
 benami sampatti ko vaid karne kaa tarika hamodi ne kaha ki ye to bahut saaf-saaf mukhauta he, lalan choudhary yaa hridayanand choudhary ke paas pan nambar bhi nahi he
 The person who is gifting a property of 62 lakhs does not even have a PAN number
 inlogon kaa jameen likhavane main istemaal kiya gaya he 
 If Lalu Prasad Yadav was a minister of Jabalpur, he could not get all the family's land written in his name, and now he is getting himself gifted
 to yahi benami sampatti ko vaid karne kaa tarika log apanaate he iske jariye kaale dhan ko white karne ke tareeke ke rup main istenmal kiya he lekin lalu ji ko ye nahi maaloom he ki narendra modi kii sarkaar he benami kanoon ban chukaa he or jo sari kii sari zamin benami sampatti he vah aaj na kal jabt hogi
 Bhoomi Mododi, who was written in the name of giving the job, said that Hridayananda Chaudhary is a fourth grade employee in the railway and when Lalu Prasad Yadav was the railway minister, he got a job in the post of Khalasi which was taken by the grace of Lalu ji
 lalan singh or shivanand tiwari ye vahi log he jinako lalu ji ne naukari di or unke naam se zamin likhva lee yaa unke naam se zamin likhva liya gaya or ab usko gift karvaa rahe he
 Lalu ji got the land written in the guise of giving job, MLA and ministerial post whether it be Raghunath Jha, Kanti Singh, Lalan Chaudhary, Hridayanand Chaudhary or Shiv Prasad Chaudhary and i think it would probably be the Guinness Book of Record of Hindustan that someone More than a dozen people have donated crores of assets to a leader
 centre sarkaar karwaai karegeemodi kaa kahana he ki nitish ji karwaai nahi karenge ye main jaanata hum lekin mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki centre kii sarkaar karwaai karegi
 Modi said that i also know that Laloo Prasad Yadav will give the answer that if the matter of revenge is being done, then you will buy land benami and if done, you will shout, why is this opposition being united in the spirit of revenge So to save our property whether it is Mamta Banerjee or Mayawati or Lalu Yadav and the rally of RJD, this is not a Save the Country rally but Anonymous Save property is a rally so they were opposing demonetisation

 Laxman, who played a crucial innings of 85 runs in the first innings, is playing for 72 runs in the second innings
 unke alaava rahul dravid ne 55 or abhinav mukund ne 48 ran kaa yogadan diya, jisase bharat ne chauthe din kaa khel samaapt hone tak apni duusari pari main teen wicket 229 ran banaae
 In this way, he has now gained a total of 240 runs
 lakshmana ne apni pari ke dauraan dravid ke saath tisare wicket ke liye 63 ran kii saajhedaari kii, jabaki yuva viraat kohli (naabad 26) ke saath vah chauthe wicket ke liye 75 ran jod chuke hai
 Laxman has so far hit six fours in his innings facing 171 balls
 barish ke kaaran subah khel ek ghanta deree se shuru hua
 India carried on their innings by 23 runs without any loss, but they lost the wicket of Vijay on the 13th ball of the day
 iske baad dravid or mukund ne duusare wicket ke liye 63 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 The conditions were not batting friendly
 pich main oochaal thi, jabaki outfield bhi kaaphi dhimi thi
 In such a situation, the Indians also scored slow
 bharat ne pehle satr main lagbhag 16 over main 39 ran, duusare satr main 35 over main 81 ran or tisare satr main 33 over main 86 ran banaae
 He lost one wicket in all three seasons
 dravid bhi jab 10 ran par khel rahe the, tab unhen andeh kaa laabh mila
 He flicks Caribbean captain Darren Sammy, but he goes to midwicket
 adrian barath ne aage girakar use kaich main tabdeel kar diya, lekin yah sahi kaich tha yaa nahin, iske liye tisare ampire kii madad lee gai
 The third umpire also failed to reach any decision and after a long discussion, the decision finally went in favor of Dravid
 duusare chor par mukund ne acchhee pari kheli, lekin bhagya unke saath nahin tha
 When Mukund needed only two runs for his first Test half-century, Edwards' bouncer ended his batting innings
 mukund ne teji se uthati gend ko rokane kii koshish kii, lekin vah unke dastaanon ko chuumati hui carlton bow ke dastaanon main chali gai
 He played 81 balls in his innings and hit six fours
 dravid or lakshmana kii anbhavi jodi dabadabe ke saath ballebaaji karne main naakaam rahi
 Rampal and leg-spinner Debendra Bishu also troubled the two on some occasions
 in donon ne tisare wicket ke liye 65 ran kii saajhedaari kii, lekin iske liye unhone 30 over kharch kiye
 Dravid did not last long thereafter
 unhone edwards kii uthati gend par cat shot khelaa, lekin unki timming sahi nahin thi or gend balle kaa kinaaraa lekar slip main ramanaresh sarwan ke paas chali gai
 Dravid played 171 balls in his innings and hit three fours
 edwards ne ab tak 58 ran dekar do wicket liye hai
 When Laxman was on 31, Darren Bravo missed his catch at midwicket off Bishoo
 agle over main bhagya ne kohli kaa bhi saath diya
 Edwards' bouncer hit his bat and fell slightly ahead of Barath at short leg
 kohli ne agali short pich gend ko midwicket par chah ran ke liye bhejkar 19veen gend par apana khaataa kholaa
 Laxman soon completed his second half-century of the match, which is also his 51st half-century in Tests

 On the day of Ekadashi, make urad dal, urad ki big and puris and do not use rice
 - bhagavadgita kaa paath karen
 - Provide food to the poor and seek blessings from them
 indira ekadshi ke din kis prakaar pitaron kii aatma ko shanti den?- iske liye bhagwaan ko fal or tulsi dal arpit karen
 - Read Bhagavad Gita before God
 - nirdhanon ko fal kaa daan karen
