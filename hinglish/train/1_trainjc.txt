 dilli mahila ayog main niyukti ko lekar chal rahe vivaad kii sunwaayee main dilli hai court ne alji offis se poocha he ki kya mahila ayog main kii gai sabhi niyuktiyaan gaiyrkanoonee hai
 In this case, the High Court has questioned whether the rape crisis cell and other units run by the Commission for rape victims should be closed after the court order
 court ne alji offis ko in muddon par apana paksh spasht karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 During the hearing, the counsel appearing for the LG told the court that the Chairman of the Commission, Swati Maliwal, has no authority to make appointments in the various units of the Commission
 wo niyukti karne ke liye adhikrut hi nahin hai
 If they need people to work, they should urge the concerned authorities about this
 is par court ne alji ke vakil se poocha ki wo bataaen kya ayog dwaara kii gayi sabhi niyuktiyaan gaiyrkanoonee hai yaa phir unamem se kuch galat tarah se rakhe gaye hai
 Does LG Office want to make new appointments to run these units? maamle kii agali sunwaayee hai court 9 farvari ko karegaa
 Swati Maliwal has been accused of this, the Delhi Commission for Women Advocate said that her budget is approved till 31 March 2017 and she should be allowed to give salary to the employees till this period
 ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal par niyuktiyon main aniyamitaayen baratane kaa aarope he
 The case is pending in Tis Hazari Court
 pichley hafte court ne is maamle menswati maliwal ko samanbhi kiya he
 The anti-corruption Branch is investigating the matter
 pesh maamle main ayog ke karmchaariyon ne alag-alag do yachikaaon main court se apana bakaayaa vetan bhugtan karaane kaa aagrah kiya he
 The High Court had earlier directed the employees to pay their outstanding salaries on January 18 and December 2016

 unke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii jaachan hogi
 Significantly, on September 13, the Anti Corruption Bureau of Maharashtra had demanded the State Home Ministry to initiate an investigation against Bhujbal
 bijepi ne aarope lagaaya tha ki maharashtra sadan main 10 hazaar karod kaa ghotaalaa hua he
 Bhujbal is alleged to have been given subcontracts to his relatives, which greatly benefited him
 dilli main sarkari kharch se maharashtra sadan banaaya gaya
 This is a government guest house
 ye ek sanjog hi he ki vishwa paryaavaran diwas ke din hamen lakhanu se dilli ke raste par gajraula main ye green dhaba dikh gaya
 It would not be wrong to call 'bhajan' Dhaba on National Highway 24, along with Macdonaldus and KFC, the first Green Dhaba in India, as we have not yet found such a dhaba in UP or any other part of the country
 kisi dhabas kii yaa restaraan kii zyaada taareef aapane uske khaane ke bare main hi suni hogi
 But the specialty of Bhajan Dhaba begins with its architecture
 'lorie baker' style architekchar main deevaaron ke andar spes rakhaa jaataa he, jisase ye hawa yaa garmi ko trep nahin karti or isliye garmiyon main kamare kaa taapmaana thanda or sardiyon main garam rahata he
 Even in such heat, you can sit comfortably at this place only with a fan
 puure dhabas main kahin bhi sariye kaa istemaal nahin kiya gaya he
 The roofs of bricks have been made in such a way by giving a curve so that all the load falls on the 'beam' on both the sides and there is no need for a shield
 cement ke kam se kam istemaal ke liye ghadon kaa dhakkan bich-bich main lagaaya gaya he jo cement kii bachat ke saath-saath ise ek khubasurat dizine bhi banaata he
 Old wood has been installed everywhere
 puraane gharon se nikle darvaaze feet kiye gaye hai
 Old bricks are used
 kyonki iskaa architekchar bharat main aam nahin he, isliye iske liye pehle mazaduron ko training di jaati thi or phir bananaa shuru kiya jaataa tha
 Where else would you eat more than this, when the vegetables grown on the empty land behind the dhaba are directly used for the food of the dhaba
 bache hue khaane ko baio gas banane ke liye prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Two-thirds of the dhaba gas is supplied with this bio gas
 dhabas ke maalik vikramjit singh bedi kaa daawa he ki ye baio gas plant uttar pradesh kaa sabase bada baio gas plant he
 The compost released from bio gas is then used for the vegetables grown behind
 saath hi ek rain harvesting system bhi he jo barish ke pani kaa sanchay karata he
 Recycled water is used for toilets and cleaning
 anumaan he ki agle kuch saalon main barish ke pani ke sanchay se zamin kaa ground water level 3-4 fit upar aa jaayegaa
 Sun windows have been installed in the dhaba so that there is no need to light a small bulb here till the sun is hidden and thus about 30% of electricity is saved
 vikramjit ne bataaya ki is tarah ke unke 3 or dhabas hai
 But only such kind of kitchen is used there
 1969 se unke pita ke vaqt se ye dhabas astitv main hai
 The Green Dhaba was inaugurated in October last year but is yet to be completed
 wo is dhabas main abhi kai or nae prayog karnaa chaahate hai
 Vikramjit's father said that the land that has given so much should be returned as much as possible
 tippaniyan Vikramjit's mother Madhu Chaturvedi is also a famous Hindi poetess
 logon ko acha khaanaa khilaane ke saath-saath ye parivaar logon ko apane dhabas ke bare main kushi-kushi bataata bhi he or chahta he ki baaki log bhi is tarah kii shuruyaat karen
 Bhajan Dhaba is not just a place to eat, but also an environment school
 vikramjit singh bedi ne kuch skulon se anurodh bhi kiya he ki wo apane vidhyaarthiyon ko yahaan laaen taaki wo choti umr se hi paryaavaran or urja sanchay ke bare main sikh saken
 Even after doing so with their own thinking and dedication, this family is going round the electricity department for electricity in this dhaba
 lekin pichley 15 maheene se inhen bijli nahin mil paayi he
 You must have understood the reason
 paryaavaran diwas par ab paryaavaran ke liye sirf sochna or bolnaa hi kaaphi nahin balki bedi parivaar kii tarah kuch nae sakaaratmak kadam uthaane kii bhi zarurat he
 You must have heard more about the food of a restaurant or restaurant
 lekin bhajan dhabas kii khaasiyat iske architekchar se shuru hoti he
 The 'laurie Baker' style architecture allows space to be placed inside the walls, so that it does not trap air or heat and therefore keeps the room temperature cool in summer and warm in winter
 itani garmi main bhi is jagah aap sirf pankhe ke sahare aaraam se baith sakate hai
 The head has not been used anywhere in the entire dhaba
 eenton kii chhaton ko karv dekar is tarah banaaya gaya he taaki sara bhaar donon taraf 'beam' par pade or sariye kii zarurat naa pade
 For minimal use of cement, the lid of the clocks has been installed periodically, which in addition to saving the cement makes it a beautiful design
 har jagah puraani lakdi lagaayi gayi he
 The doors from the old houses are fitted
 puraani inte kaam main laayi gayi hai
 Because its architecture is not common in India, so workers were first trained for this and then started making
 isse zyaada khalis khaanaa aap or kahaan khaaenge, jab dhabas ke peeche padi khaali zamin par ugaai subjiyan sidhe dhabas ke khaane ke liye istemaal hoti hai
 The leftover food is used to make bio gas
 isi baio gas se dhabas kii do-tihaai gas kii aapurti ho jaati he
 Dhaba owner Vikramjit Singh Bedi claims that this bio gas plant is the largest bio gas plant in Uttar Pradesh
 baio gas se nikali khaad phir peeche ugaai subjiyon ke kaam aati he
 There is also a rain harvesting system which stores rain water
 shauchalayon or safai ke liye risaikal kiye pani kaa istemaal hota he
 It is estimated that in the next few years, the ground water level of the ground will rise by 3-4 feet due to accumulation of rain water
 dhabas main san windo lagaayi gayi hai taaki suraj chhipane tak yahaan chota sa balb jalaane kii bhi zarurat nahin pade or is tarah takreeban 30% bijli bachaa lee jaati he
 Vikramjeet told that he has 3 more such dhabas
 lekin vahaan par abhi sirf is tarah kii rasoi hi kaam main laayi jaati he
 These dhabas have been in existence since 1969 at the time of his father
 is green dhabas kaa pichley saal oktober main udghaatan kiya gaya lekin abhi unka kaam puraa nahin hua he
 He wants to do many more new experiments in this dhaba right now
 vikramjit ke pita kaa kahana tha ki jis zamin ne itnaa diya he, use zyaada se zyaada lautaaya jaye
 The comments vikramjit kii maa madhu chaturvedi hindi kii mashhoor kavyitri bhi hai
 In addition to feeding people good food, this family also tells people about their dhabas happily and wants others to start like this
 bhajan dhaba sirf khaane kii jagah nahin, balki paryaavaran kii ek paathshaala bhi he
 Vikramjit Singh Bedi has also requested some schools to bring their students here so that they can learn about environment and energy accumulation from a young age
 apni soch or lagan se itnaa sab karne ke baad bhi ye parivaar is dhabas main bijli ke liye bijli vibhaag ke chakkar laga rahaa he
 But for the last 15 months, they have not been able to get electricity
 kaaran aap samaj hi gaye honge
 On Environment Day, it is not enough to just think and speak for the environment, but like Bedi family, some new positive steps also need to be taken
 puure dhabas main kahin bhi sariye kaa istemaal nahin kiya gaya he
 The roofs of bricks have been made in such a way by giving a curve so that all the load falls on the 'beam' on both the sides and there is no need for a shield
 cement ke kam se kam istemaal ke liye ghadon kaa dhakkan bich-bich main lagaaya gaya he jo cement kii bachat ke saath-saath ise ek khubasurat dizine bhi banaata he

 "petrus bone'' maanav khopadi kaa ek aprishkrut lekin upyogi hissaa he—mul rup se yah aapke aantarik kaan kii raksha karata he
 But it just doesn't take care of that much
 haal ke varshon main, pracheen kankal se diene nikaalane main jute anuvanshiki vaigyanikon ne paaya he ki petrus haddi ke ek khaas hisse (karnavart ko suraksha dene vaala hissaa) kaa ghanatv bahut adhik hota he or usase kisi anya utak ke mukaable kai baar 100 guna adhik diene nikaale ja sakate hai
 Now this infallible discovery can answer the most hotly debated history of India
 jab haryana ke rakhigadhi se 4,500 saal puraane kankal ke "petrus bone'' ke avasheshon ke adhyayan kaa puraa parinaam saamne aa jayega, tab hamaare desh ke itihaas or vigyaan ke kuch behtareen dimaagon ke saath hi saath kai netaaon ko bhi pareshaan karne vaale kuch prashnon ke uttar, is prakaar hone chahie—prashnh kya hadappa sabhyataa ke log sanskrit bhashaa or vaidic hindu dharm kii samskruti kaa mul strot the?uttarah nahin

 Question: Which of the South Indians and North Indians did they meet today? Answer: South Indians
 ye saare prashn nishchit rup se vivaadaaspad hai
 a paper reaching these conclusions is expected to be available online this month
 puratatvvetta tathaa pune ke deccan college ke kulapati dow
 The revelations in the much-awaited and long-held excavation of a team led by Vasant Shinde in 2015 are about to be revealed
 itnaa lanbaa samay kyon laga? ek saal pehle jab is lekhak ne scindia se baat kii thi to ek jawaab kuch yun mila tha, " yah rajnatik rup se behad samvedansheel mudda he
 Shinde promised to publish the findings of his research in September 2017
 puratatvavid is tathy kaa zikr kar rahe the ki hadappa sabhyataa ko lekar kisi bhi shodh ko centre sarkaar ke hindutv ke agenda se takaraana padegaa—jisaki raajnneeti vaidic hindu dharm ko bhartiya sabhyataa kii utpatti bataae jane kii maang karti he
 It is a matter of enormous dilemma for historians or anyone working on the Harappan or Indus Valley Civilization
 darasal, jab 1920 ke dashak main sindhu ghati sabhyataa pehali baar "khoji gai'' thi, aupniveshik puratatvavidon ne ise tatkaal purv-vaidic kaal kii sabhyataa-samskruti ke saboot ke rup main sweekaar liya or unhone "arya'' akramanakariyon kaa ek nayaa siddhant diya or kaha ki uttar-pashchim se aae aaryon ne hadappa sabhyataa ko puri tarah nasht karke hindu bharat kii neenv rakhi
 In later years, most mainstream historians rejected the "aryan invasion doctrine" as an oversimplification — while accepting the chronological notion that Vedic civilization was accepted as the heir to the Indus Valley civilization
 aaryon ke akraman kaa siddhant hindutv ke pairokaar rashtravaadiyon ko chubhta he, bhale hi usne dakshin bharat main lokapriy raajnneeti kii aisi mul katha ke rup main apni jaden jamaa lee hai jo sindhu ghati sabhyataa ko dravid samskruti ke rup main dekhati he
 He believes that the invading Aryans attacked the original inhabitants of India and drove them south across the Vindhyas and this civilization only succeeded in protecting itself from "brahminical" invaders in South India
 mahaan aakankshaayenis bich, sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log vastav main koun the, yah ab bhi rahasy bana hua he
 Shinde understands the inconsistent burden of all the expectations that the 4,500-year-old resident of Rakhigarhi, a small village in Haryana, now in the dusty Khadar of a dead river (classified as "I4411") Is derived from aapane rakhigadhi kaa naam suna bhi hogaah pichley dedh dashak main yah naam harappayugin / sindhu ghati ke bharat ke sabase bade kshetra ke rup main pathyapustakon, paryaton ke parchon or media main chaaya rahaa
 In fact, since 2014, it is said to be bigger than "moenjo-daro", an archaeological site in Sindh, Pakistan, which was first excavated in the 1920s
 atishyokti ke put ke baavjood, 1960 ke dashak ke uttarardh ke baad se yahaan ruk-rukkar hui khudaai main, ise 7veen sahasrabdi isa purv kii ek vishaal nagar vyavastha ke rup main pahachaanaa gaya
 Most importantly, the seven mounds standing in the village present enough evidence to accept it as the site of the "developed" Harappan city system of the second and third millennium BC
 yah aisa shahar he jo bharat kii pehali nagar sabhyataa ke rup main phala-phula or 4,000 saal se bhi pehle, rahasyamay tareeke se nasht ho gaya
 The most shocking revelation of the research conducted at Rakhigarhi may be, which is not yet known: no indication of the genetic marker "R1A1" has been found in ancient DNA from the site
 yah mahatvapurn he kyonki "aar1e1'', jise aksar ham "arya jin'' kehete hai, ke bare main ab kaha jaataa he ki yah multah kaansya yug ke un pashupalkon kaa he jo madhya asian "pontic stapi'' (kaala sagar or caspian sagar ke bich faile ghaas ke maidaanon main) se lagbhag 4,000 saal pehle anya sthanon par chale gaye
 Their migration left a strong and "gender-biased" genetic influence on a population of two geographically remote but linguistically interconnected parts of the world, northern India and northern Europe, for example
 is
 rakhigadhi diene pariyojna ke mukhya anuvaanshik shodhakarta niraj raay kehete hai, "ham aar1e kaa ullekh nahin kar rahe hai
 R1A is not there
 '' beshak, unki sweekaarokti shabdadambaron main lipati hui thi, lekin isse jaahir ho rahaa tha ki is shodhpatr main prastut aankade rakhigadhi ke "aai 4411'' kii anuvaanshik saamagree se liye gaye hai jo ki ek purush he—aar1e ek utparivartan (mutesan) he jo keval purush vaai gunasutra ke namoonay main dekha jaataa he
 The absence of this genetic identity in a person's first genome sample from the Indus Valley Civilization reinforces the concept that there is already a general consensus among genetic scientists, historians, and linguists — the Indus Valley Civilization already existed And this is for cattle, horse and chariot riders, armed with axes and other weapons, proto-sanskrit-speaking migrants, whose descendants today are north HE Indian stand out most clearly in the upper caste communities, were quite different
 raay kaa kahana he ki heplogrup aar1e rakhigadhi ke namoonay main dikhaai nahin de rahaa to vah isliye, kyonki vahaan se simit maatra main anuvanshik data praapt hua he
 Or it may be that haplogroup R1a is not present in that ancient resident of Rakhigarhi
 raay ne kaha, "hamaare paas vaai gunasutra kshetron (jinom) ke bare main zyada kawarej nahin he
 "he said he extracted more data from mitochondrial and autosomal DNA in his sample (the mitochondrial DNA test provides genetic information from both the maternal lineage and the parents from the autosomal test)
" haalanki unhone yah jor dekar sweekaar kiya ki "madhya asian logon kaa baari sankhya main pravaas hua or isse dakshin asian anuvanshik sanrachana main kaaphi badlaav aayaa'' or pracheen rakhigadhi ke nivaasiyon kaa "madhya asian logon ke saath koi sambandh nahin he
 "in other words, while the inhabitants of the Indus Valley Civilization did not have any concern with this lineage, you ordinary Indian readers should know that 17 of the male breed in your genes
 5 pratishat hissaa stapi ke pashupalkon kaa he
 It is worth noting here that this genetic trait is present in a system far more influential than the relatively insignificant biological heritage of Islamic or European colonial invaders dominating India's political imagination
 to, ab ham yah jaan chuke hai hamaare 4,500 varsh puraane purvaj "aai 4411'' koun nahin the
 Then who were they? The short answer, according to Rai, is that I4411 "appears to have greater closeness with the South Indian tribal population
 ''vishesh rup se nilgiri kii pahadiyon main rahane vaale irula se
 One draft of the paper suggests that this person may actually be placed closer to the irula (a group with genetic properties such as an ancestor)
 
 
 lekin punjabiyon ke samaan aise samoohon kii taraf nahin jinamein pashchimi ureshian nasl kaa ucch anupaat dikhataa he
 The report further states that the residents of Rakhigarhi probably spoke a Dravidian language
 baharhaal, parinaamon main upmahadweep ke baahar kii duusari aabaadi, jinhen "irani krishak'' mana jaataa he, ke saath mishran anuvanshik ke spasht sakshya bhi dikhte hai
 It is a population identified in earlier studies of ancient DNA and is consistent with the hypothesis that the spread of agricultural technology came from the exposure of the "fertile Crescent" of West Asia to Eurasian agriculture in the 5th to 8th millennium BCE
 Is accepted as one of the place of origin of
 bharatiyon kii puraani peedi ke liye rakhigadhi kaa nishkarsh aisa lag saktaa he jaise unhone skulon kii kitabon main jo padhaa tha or use phir se padhgaye kii jarurat haih "dravid'' harappavasiyon ke baad vaidic yug ke ghudsavaar stapi ke ghaas ke maidaanon se aae the
 And those who monitor the recent developments in demographic genetics will be familiar with what has come out of this latest conclusion
 is bich, lokapriy press main hadappa yug ke bharat ke puratathvik yaa anuvanshiki (genetics) ke haalia anusandhanon kaa jo bhi kawarej aayaa he, vah "aaryon ke akraman siddhant'' par jabaran bhatakaane kii had tak kendrit rahaa he
 What does this mean? And why does it matter? The answer lies in the fact that in recent years there has been a lot of uproar over ancient Indian history
 chal-kapatrakhigadhi adhyayan ke nishkarshon kii khabar aane ke purv bade anumaan lagaae ja rahe the
 With the help of related papers and their media reports, this matter was given a lot of air and there was a fierce debate on social media and blogs
 scindia ko kaha gaya ki ve kuch aisa ishaara den jisase yah prachaarit kiya ja sake ki rakhigadhi ke parinaam yahaan ke vartmaan nivaasiyon (mukhya rup se jat, jo aar1e stapi pravashiyon ke vanshaj samajhe jate hai) or us pracheen shahar ke nivaasiyon ke bich "santati'' ke sambandhon ko ingit karte hon
 In this turbulent period, hardly anyone is surprised that in this civil war, which is eager to go back to ancient history, false news will be used as a weapon
 is saal janvari main ek hindi akhbaar ne niraj raay se saakshaatkaar par aadhaarit ek lekh prakashit kiya, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki rakhigadhi se praapt diene vastav main uttar bhartiya brahmanon ke diene se bahut miltaa-julata he or iske nishkarsh us prachlit tathy ko sthapit karenge ki bharat hi indo-europea bhashaa bolne waalon kaa "udgam sthaan'' tha
 "sheer nonsense!" —david Weslowski had a similar reaction to the Haliya debate
 eurogens blog ke host weslovski ko duniya ke agrani anuvanshikividon main shumaar kiya jaataa he
 On the site of Weslowski, there was a constant debate about whether the skeletal DNA obtained from Rakhigarhi would yield only the R1A1 marker
 yahaan, anvik saakshyon ke utkrisht binduon par vistrut or gudh charchaaon ko aksar "aap bevakoof hai'' yaa "jab parinaam saamne aaenge to aapako manochikitsak kii jarurat hogi'' jaisi tippaniyon ke saath khaarij kar diya jaataa tha
 And from what has been coming out so far, it seems that Weslowski's prediction that "there was no R1a among the Harappans but they were closer to the South Indians" is going to be proved correct

 But it seems that what has been tried to hide will be revealed this year because on one hand, this fact is expected to emerge in a research paper prepared by Rike and his team at Harvard, on the other hand Rakhigarhi who spearheaded the project The conclusion of scientists is also similar

 It is worth mentioning here that Narasimhan and others, using the DNA of ancient human remains found on the site of the Indus Valley Civilization, discovered a model of the Harappan genome that belonged to the "visitors" of the Indus Valley and who along with the Harappans Was a business contact

 electronic voting mashin (EVM) kii vishwasaneeyata chunaav se pehle or chunaav ke baad vibhinn raajnneetik partiyon ke liye ek ahm mudda banataa dikh rahaa he
 Recently, Congress Party questioned its credibility even after winning three out of five state assembly elections
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) nekaha tha ki ham bhale hi chunaav main jite hon lekin hamen abhi bhi lagata he ki EVM ke saath koi bhi chhedchhad kar saktaa he
 Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora has given a big statement amidst the questions about EVM
 unhone kaha ki matdaan kii yah sarvaadhik vishwasaneey paddati he kyonki mashin galat rakrakhaav kii shikaar to ho sakati he lekin isamen chhedchhad mumkin hi nahin he
 Newly appointed CEC Arora on Thursday on the issue of the Election Commission also coming under the purview of political parties' allegations on evms said that political parties are the main parties after the electorate
 unhen apni baat kehane kaa puraa adhikaar he, lekin is baat se mujhe dukh hota he, hamane iviem ko footbal bana diya he
 Regarding the tendency of any particular party to contest the EVM if the election results were not in favor, Arora said that the results of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the results of the subsequent Delhi Assembly elections were completely opposite
 iske baad bhi himachal pradesh, gujarat, karnataka, tripura or ab paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav va tamaam upachunaav ke parinaam bilkul bhinn rahe
 Referring to the interpretation of election results by political parties at his convenience, Arora said that EVM is just a machine which records and counts figures
 mashin main khaas programing kar vishesh parinaam hasil karne kii sambhaavna ko main puri tarah se nakaar saktaa hum
 On the question of recovery of evms in places other than polling stations in five states, Arora said that tampering with the machine and its wrong maintenance are two separate issues
 jo shikaayatein in chunaavon ke dauraan milin, ve karmchaariyon dwaara galat rakrakhaav kii shrenee main aati hai
 Such cases have come up, although this number is negligible, but the Commission is still trying to bring this number to zero
 raajnneetik dalon kii mataptr kii taraf waapas lautne kii maang ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki mataptr kii ore waapas lautne kaa sawaal hi nahin he
 This is the clear stand of the Election Commission

 Many allegations made by Kafeel's family (NDTV team has not edited this news

 ) paanch rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa kii haar or khaastaur par hindi pattee ke chunavi nateezon ne uttarakhand sarkaar or bhaajapa sanghathan donon kii chintaa badha di he
 The BJP, which alone won a two-thirds majority in Uttarakhand in 2017, believes that it is necessary to keep the workers together to cross the party's fleet in the Lok Sabha elections
 ab bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh kah rahe hai ki jald hi netaaon ko sarkaar or sanghathan main shaamil kiya jayega
 At present, the BJP has all the five Lok Sabha seats in the state and the chief challenge is to retain them
 asal main chintaa is baat kii he ki uttarakhand main haal hi hue nikaay chunaav main bhi bhaajapa ko uske daavon ke vipareet kam siten mili thim
 The reason for this was also considered to be the displeasure of the workers
 ab aagaamee 2019 main prastaavit chunaav main loksabhaa main kaaryakarta puure dilo-jaan ke saath lagen, iske liye ab pradesh party adhyaksh ajay bhatta netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko 'edjust' karne kii baat kah rahe hai taaki chunavi mukaable main party ekajute hokar congress se do-do haath kar sake
 On the other hand, 2 ministerships are yet to be filled in the ruling Trivendra Singh Rawat cabinet in the state
 iske alaava kai nigamon, aayogon main netaaon ko 'edjust' karne ke alaava kai vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv bhi banaae jane kii charchaa party main lagaataar chalati rahi he, jise lekar party netaa dilli darbar or bhaajapa pradesh ke chakkar lagaate aae hai
 Chief Minister Rawat has remained silent on this till now
 lekin ab loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar party par dabaav zyada he or taalamatol karnaa baari pad saktaa he
 There is a pomegranate hundred sick condition among the BJP mlas for the vacant two cabinet posts
 bhaajapa ke sabhi 47 vidhayakon ne pradesh adhyaksh bhatta ke saamne mantri pad ke liye apni-apni daavedaari pesh kar di
 But Bhatt avoided the expansion and selection of the cabinet by calling it a privilege of the Chief Minister
 duusari taraf, loksabhaa chunaav ke tikaton kaa bantwaaraa bhi ek chunauti hi he
 At present, the Lok Sabha seats in the state are Mala Rajalakshmi Shah from Tehri, BC Khanduri from Pauri, Ajay Tamta from Almora, Bhagat Singh Kosari from Nainital and Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank MP from Haridwar
 kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki satta virdohi rujhaan se nibatane ke liye bhaajapa kuch siton par pratyaashee badal sakati he
 Also, some veterans can also be said to contest from another seat
 party sutron ke anusaar, tehri, paudi or haridwar loksabhaa seat par ummidavaar badale ja sakate hai
 At present, the BJP leadership is closely brainstorming on each Lok Sabha seat and it is being told that the announcement of the names of candidates in these five seats may be shocking
 loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari or daavedaari kii chintaaon ke saath hi vidhayakon kii nigahen mantrimandal main khaali do siton par bhi gadi hui hai
 Recently in the state office of the BJP, along with the party's Legislature Party, the organization's core group also met
 in donon baithkon ke ek hi din hue aayojan ko bhaajapa ke vidhayakon ne achche avasar ke rup main liya or pradesh adhyaksh bhatta ke saamne kisi na kisi tarah mantri pad ke liye apni-apni daavedaari pesh kii
 According to sources, in addition to the cabinet, all the remaining 47 mlas of the BJP have declared their claim to the post of minister
 is daavedaari ko jaij tehraane ke liye vibhinn kism ke tark prastut kiye gaye, jinamein kisi ne kshetra ko to kisi ne jaateey santulan ko aadhaar bataaya he
 There was also talk of giving new faces a chance
 bhaajapa netaaon main kuch isi tarah kii bekaraari sarkaar main daayitv paane ko lekar bhi he
 There is also a lot of pressure on Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat to give responsibility in the government to the leaders associated with the organization

 Former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa on Wednesday intensified his attack against the BJP government in the state, claiming that his party Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP) would decide on the future of the Jagdish Shettar-led state government on 4 January
 yediurppa ne ‘vidhaan saudh chalo’ naam se virodh march nikaalane se pehle freedom park main sabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki bhaajapa sarkaar bahumat kho chuki he or use bane rahane kaa koi naitik adhikaar nahin he

 (photo- Mohsin) Arvind Datar, appearing on behalf of the petitioners in the hearing of what happened on Tuesday, said that the code of homosexuality of 1860 was imposed on India
 yah tatkaaleen british sansad kaa ichha kaa pratinidhitiv bhi nahin karata tha
 He said, 'if this law were implemented today, it would not be constitutionally correct
 ' is par court ne unase kaha- aap hamen bharosa dilaaie ki agar aaj kii taarikh main koi aisa kanoon banaaya jaataa he to yah sthaayee nahin hoga
 Arvind Datar said, 'if a person has a different sexual orientation, it cannot be called a crime
 ise prakruti ke khilaaf nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Homosexuality is not a disease
 yon rujhaan or langik pahchaan donon samaan rup se kisi kii prakritik pravriti ke tathy hai
 The only judge in the bench Indu Malhotra said that homosexuality is seen not only in men but also in animals
 vah daataar ke samalangita ko saamaanya or ahimsak bataane or maanviya youniktaa kaa ek rup bataane par tippanee kar rahi thim
 Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Central Government, said that this case should be limited to Section 377
 iskaa uttaradhikaar, shaadi or sambhog ke maamalon par koi asar nahin padana chahie
 To this, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra remarked that this case is only connected with the validity of Section 377
 iskaa shaadi yaa duusare naagarik adhikaron se lenaa-dena nahin he
 That debate is the second
 purv atorni general mukul rohtagi yachikakartaon kii ore se dhara 377 ko hataane ke liye pesh hue
 He said, 'with the introduction of Section 377, the LGBT community feels itself an undeclared criminal
 samaaj bhi inhen alag najar se dekhtaa he
 Sexual trends and gender are different things
 yah cese yon pravriti se sambandhit he
 Gender has nothing to do in this case
 yon pravriti kaa maamla pasand se bhi alag he
 It is natural
 yah paidaa hone ke saath hi insaan main aati he
 There have been researches on this subject in the Western world
 is tarah kii yon pravriti ke kaaran vanshanugat hote hai
 Section 377 talks about 'natural' sex
 samalangikta bhi prakritik he, yah aprakritik nahin he
 'rohatgi said,' Section 377 violates human rights
 samaaj ke badalane ke saath hi naitiktaayen badal jaati hai
 We can say that 160 years old moral values will not be today's moral values
 british upniveshvaadiyon ke 1860 ke naitik mulyon se prakritik sex ko paribhaashit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The morality of ancient India was different from that of Victorian morality
 venugopal nahin rakhenge sarkaar kaa pakshatorni general keke venugopal ne samalangikta ke mudde se judi vibhinn yachikaaon par supreme court ke faisle kii rivyuu yachika kii sunwaayee se khud ko alag kar liya
 Let us tell you that on Tuesday, Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta replaced the government in place of Attorney General
 keke venugopal ne kaha he ki unki raay is maamle main centre sarkaar se alag he, isliye vah is maamle kii sunwaayee main supreme court main sarkaar kii ore se pesh nahin honge
 When asked about this, Venugopalaka said in clear terms, 'the opinion of the government that i had kept now is different from the opinion of the government
 yahi vajah he ki main is maamle main supreme court kii samvidhan peeth ke saamne pesh nahin ho rahaa hum
 Can not be done in due course
 vaise meri atirikt solicytor general tushaar mehta se is mudde ke takneekee or kanoonee pahaluon ke saath daleelon or tarkon par kaaphi gambhir charchaa hui he
 KK Venugopal said that the judges who have heard the case in the Delhi High Court have come to the Supreme Court after being very experienced
 jetali kii bhi alag he sarkaar se raaikendriya mantri arun jetali pehle hi dhara 377 ko hataane kii vakaalat kar chuke hai
 Jaitley had said in 2015 that the Supreme Court should reconsider Section 377 of the IPC
 unhone kaha ki supreme court ko samalangikta ke maamle main dilli hoicourt kaa faisla nahin badalanaa chahie tha
 Jaitley said that the Supreme Court's decision on homosexuality does not match the legal decisions being taken worldwide
 unhone kaha tha ki duniya bhar main log alag-alag sexual orientations ko apana rahe hai
 In such a situation, sending someone to jail on the basis of sexual relations seems like a very old idea
 pashuon ko lekar centre sarkaar kii nai skimgiriraaj singh kaa elaan- ab sirf bachhiya paidaa hongemathura main pradhanmantri ne launch kii kai yojanaenpradhanmantri narendra modi ne buudhvaar ko uttar pradesh ke mathura main kai yojanaon kii shuruyaat kii
 This included the elimination of single-use plastic, animal health planning and several vaccination projects
 is dauraan kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne bayaan diya ki ab desh main aisi technology kaa istemaal kiya jayega jisase sirf bachhiya hi paidaa hogi
 The Union Minister said that for the first time animals are being vaccinated on such a large scale
 is yojana se sirf pashuon se hi nahin balki pashupalkon kaa bhi phayda hoga
 Giriraj Singh said, 'if there is a heifer at the farmer's house, then the farmer is unhappy
 aaj aap (piem modi) ye technology desh ko samarpit kar rahe hai, isse keval bachhiya hi kisaanon ke ghar main paidaa hogi
 We have resorted to technology for the welfare of animals
 ’is dauraan kendriya mantri ne kaha ki ab desh main doodh dene vaale jaanwaron kii tanging kii jaaegi, unka tikaakaran kiya jayega
 Giriraj Singh said that the steps taken by the Government of India under the leadership of Narendra Modi for the interests of farmers are welcome
 kya he ye yojana?aapako bataa den ki aaj mathura main kai yojanaon kii shuruyaat kii gai he, inamen vargeekrut veery garbhaadhan yojana (sex sorted cemen), kritrim garbhaadhan yojana shaamil hai
 Due to these techniques, the probability of producing only heifer increases and the expectation of having a heifer is much less
 aksar kisaan agar bacha paidaa hota he, to use khule main chhod dete hai yaa phir unka kam hi istemaal kar pate hai
 This is the reason why this technology is being promoted by the government
 abhi bhi desh main kai chote str par is yojanaon ko lagu kiya ja chukaa he, jisamen uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kaa shahar gorakhpur bhi shaamil he
 Explain that there are 50-50 sperm in animal semen, through which male and female animals are likely to be born
 haalanki, vargeekrut veery garbhaadhan ke tahat un shukranuon ko nikaal diya jaataa he jinamein bacha ke paidaa hone kii sambhaavna hoti he or is takanic ke baad 90 fisadi sambhaavna bachhiya ke paidaa hone kii hoti he
 The Waqf Board is finally ready to pay the Jama Masjid electricity bill
 haalanki usne kishton main bill bharne kii chhot maangi he
 The mosque owes a bill of 4 crore 16 lakhs
 bijli company kaa kahana he ki saalon se bill nahin bharaa gaya he
 Imam Bukhari said that since the mosque is the property of Waqf, the bill will be filled only, while according to Waqf Board President Matin Ahmed, since 1977, the Jama Masjid has been occupied by the Bukhari family, then they will pay the outstanding electricity bills
 bukhari kaa kahana tha ki agar vakf board yah sampatti unke naam kar de to ve pani or bijli ke bill bharne ko taiyaar hai
 But the Waqf Board has finally agreed to pay the bill
 duniya ke sabase mahange footbal khilaadi christiano ronaldo kii garlfriend or german model jald hi bollywood kii filmon main thumake lagaate hue najar aa sakati hai
 Ronaldo's girlfriend Irina had recently come to Mumbai for a fashion show, according to the English newspaper Midday, during which she met some Bollywood people
 aise main kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki wo hindi filmon main kaam karan chaahati hai
 Let me tell you that German beauty Irina is an international model and has been in a relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo for almost three years
 irina hollywood film harculis' main kaam kar chuki hai or kai antarrashtriya patrikaon ke cover pej par bhi najar aa chuki hai
 It is being told that during her visit to India, Irina said that she likes Bollywood movies and has seen 'slumdog Millionaire' five times
 unhone fishan photographer atul kasbekar se bhi mulaakaat kii thi
 According to Atul, 'it was nice to talk to him
 hamane kareeb 10 minute tak baatcheet kii
 However, we would say that Bollywood films have always welcomed foreign guests openly and it is expected that the audience will also take Irina in hand
 congress varking cameti kii baithak main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main deree ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya
 Initiating the CWC meeting on Monday, Sonia besieged the Modi government on several fronts
 udghaatan bhaashan main sonia ne kaha ki piem modi bina taiyaari ke jiesti laanch karne ke liye aadhi raat ko sansad aate hai, lekin satr kaa saamana karne kaa saahas ve nahin juta paa rahe
 Attacking PM Modi, he said that the tradition of Parliament is being attacked
 sansad sawaalon kaa forum he, lekin maujuuda vakt main sansadeey parampara or loktantr kaa galaa ghonta ja rahaa he
 From corruption to defense deals, the government should respond
 lekin sarkaar in sabase batch rahi he
 For this, the winter session is being postponed
 sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main bevajaah kaa vilamb kiya ja rahaa he
 Soniyane said that unemployment, rising inflation, decreasing exports and GST are issues that are affecting millions of people
 ek saal pehle notebandi kii gai, lekin isse kisaan, chote kaarobaari, gruhaniyaan or majdoor prabhavit ho rahe hai
 Only a handful of people are benefiting from the government's decision
 pradhanmantri narendra modi abhi tak jhuthe vaade or galat tathyon ko pesh karne ke alaava kuch nahin kar rahe hai
 Sonia Gandhi also accused the Nemodi government of tampering with history
 unhone kaha ki suniyojit tareeke se itihaas se pandit nehru or indira gandhi ke yogadan ko mitaayaa ja rahaa he
 Wrong facts are being taught in school books with agendas

 He said that due to the organizational election process going on for the last 18 months, Congress got an opportunity to meet lakhs of workers up to the booth level in every block, every village
 isse deshbhar main party jamini str par pehle se or majboot hui he
 The electoral process, which began in May last year, is now in its final stages
 bhartiya rigerv bank ke purv governor raghuram rajan kaa kahana he ki unhone kabhi bahucharchit notebandi kaa samarthan nahin kiya balki unhone to iske sambhavit nuksaanon ke prati sarkaar ko aagaah kiya tha
 Rajan has revealed this in his book i Do What i Do: On Reforms Rhetoric and Resolve
 iske anusaar farvari 2016 main jab sarkaar ne 500 rupee va 1000 rupee ke maujuuda noton ko chalan se baahar karne ke bare main unki raay maangi to ve rigerv bank ke governor the
 Rajan's statement is significant in relation to the claims that preparations for the unprecedented move of demonetisation were going on for a long time, which was announced on the night of November 8, 2016
 rajan ne likhaa he, mujhase sarkaar ne farvari 2016 main notebandi par drushtikon maanga jo maine maukhik diya tha
 It may have benefits in the long run but i realized that the potential short term economic losses may outweigh the long term benefits
 iske mukhya lakshyon ko praapt karne ke sambhavat: behatar vikalp honge
 Also read: Do not be outdone like George Bush on the front of the economy, Narendra Modirajan said that he had given a note to the government which explained the potential pitfalls and benefits of demonetisation and suggested alternative ways to achieve the same objectives
 
 unhone aage kaha, yadi sarkaar phir bhi notebandi kii disha main aage badhanaa chaahati he to is sthiti main note main isaki aavashyak taiyaariyon or isamen lagane vaale samay kaa bhi byora diya tha
 The results were also reported by the Reserve Bank in the event of insufficient preparation
 rajan ke anusaar, arabiai ne bina puri taiyaari ke notebandi karne ke parinaamon ke prati bhi sarkaar ko aagaah kiya tha
 It is noteworthy that Rajan withdrew from his post on September 4, and within two months of that, the government took 15
 44 lakh karod noton ko avaidh ghoshit kar diya
 Also read: Japan's Nikkei 'rolled' from Korean bomb, including Sensex and Nifty Government's move was termed as major injury against corruption and black money and it was expected that at least one third of the notes might not be returned
 haalanki kendriya bank ne pichley saptaah apni salanaa report main kaha ki is tarah kii 99 fisadi mudra banking pranali main laut ai
 He has said that the government then constituted a committee to consider these issues
 mudra sambandhi maamalon ko dekhne vaale dipti governor isaki sabhi baithkon main shaamil hue the or mere kaarykaal main kabhi bhi rigerv bank ko notebandi par nirnay lene ke liye nahin kaha gaya tha

 The central government is going to implement the GST across the country from July 1, working on the plan of One Tax One Nation
 isse puure desh main kaarobaar karne ke liye ek jaisaa tex dhaancha mil jayega or aarthik gatividhiyaan majboot hone ke saath-saath tej ho jaaegi
 According to India Today editor Anshuman Tiwari, these 11 effects will take place in the medium and long term after the GST is implemented across the country
 1
 Inflation will not increase or will increase in extreme moderation
 2
 The tax structure remains the same, so the demand will not increase
 3
 Due to GST, no significant increase in GDP is expected in the next two years
 4
 The Center or the states will not get huge revenue immediately
 5
 The number of indirect tax payers will increase, which may increase revenue in future
 6
 The central government received around 500 billion rupees in 2018 (0
 3pratishat jidipi)kaa nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he jo rajyon ko di jane vaali kshatipurti kii vajah se hoga
 7
 zyaadaatar kendriya kshatipurti maharashtra, gujarat, tamilnadu aadi saplir rajyon ko milegi
 8
 rajyon main taiyaariyaan sust hai
 Implementation may be delayed by one to two months
 9
 No matter whether we have a strong government, a popular prime minister or a single party government in most of the country, GST is politically-economically conservative and not revolutionary or miraculous
 10
 To the extent we have overhauled our tax structure
 kareeb 16 saal (2000 se 2017) ghistane ke baavjood ham aisa tex dhaancha nahin bana paae jise dekhakar duniya barabas kah uthe, 'yah hua sudhaar'11

 When i got an offer for the role of Chunnilal in Devdas, i asked the casting director, did i show you the Chunnilal who drinks alcohol and kills someone? They said no, then i refused again
 " bataa den ki shahrukh khan ke devdas main chunni laal kaa kirdaar jaiki shraf ne kiya tha
 While Anil Kapoor's role in Taal was offered to Govinda

" darasal mere aadarneey mamaji lachhu ji maharaj ne mujhase kaha ki govind jab tum dance karo to aisa nahin laganaa chahie ki tum dance karne ke liye dance kar rahe ho
 He told me tabla, explaining how to talk without speaking
 "govinda ne kaha ki unke guru ne unhen samajhaayaa tha ki jis vakt insaan dikhaave ke liye nahin balki khud ke liye dance karata he to wo dance hota he
 The actor said that when you present the entire 9 juices of the whole, then it seems that this artist extends beyond art

 The winter session of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly starts on Monday, but no amendment to the Lokayukta Act will come in this session
 rajya ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ne yah saaf kar diya he
 Anna Hazare had warned the Maharashtra government to make a proposal to strengthen the Lokayukta law by making it stronger in the winter session itself
 anna ne kaha tha ki agar sheet satr main is kanoon main badlaav nahin kiye gaye to vah satr khatm hone ke baad aalandi main bhukh hadtaal par baith jaaenge
 Chavan also said that he had asked Standing Committee head Abhishek Manu Singhvi to make a strong Lokayukta in the Lokpal Bill

 Face recognition, win prizes
 bhaag lene ke lieclic karenin donon ko uttar pradesh lokayukta ne aay se adhik sampatti rakhane ke maamle kaa doshi paaya he
 In view of the recommendations of the Lokayukta against Education Minister Ranganath Mishra, opposition parties were demanding that he be removed from the Council of Ministers immediately
 aap bhi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim main shaamil hon or shapath lenglokayukta ne aay se adhik sampatti arjeet karne ke aarope main ranganath mishra ke khilaaf bhrashtachar unmoolan adhinium ke tahat mukadmaa darj karke jaanch karaane kii sanstuti kii thi
 The Lokayukta of Uttar Pradesh, Justice NK Mehrotra, while upholding the complaint filed against the state's Secondary Education Minister Ranganath Mishra in a disproportionate assets case, by filing criminal cases under the Eradication of Corruption Act and conducting the investigation Till had recommended his removal from the Council of Ministers

 Yogi said that “I have called the Principal Secretary Home to take cognizance of all these matters
 teen talaak ke saath koi hindu yaa koi anya purush bhi ek patni ke rahete hue duusari patni ko laakar pehali patni ko pratadit karke use tyaagta he, talaak detaa he, to un sabake khilaaf kanoonee karrwai, sakht karrwai kii jaani chahie
 " sena main sevadari system yaa kahen adhikariyon ko milane vaale sahaayak system policy kii samiksha hogi
 After the complaint video of the soldiers on social media, the Ministry of Defense has come into action
 mantralay ne saaf taur par sena se kaha he ki vah sahaayak system kii samiksha kare
 It will be seen in this review whether the soldiers working as an assistant with the army officer are not posted at the field as well as at his house
 yah bhi pataa kiya jayega ki yah sahaayak, field ke saath-saath pis stesan main adhikari ke ghar or parivaar ke duusare sadasyon ke saath bhi to kaam main nahin lage hue hai
 The Ministry of Defense has ordered the Army to find out all this
 mantralay ne sena se kaha he ki field steshnon main sainya adhikariyon kii madad ke liye sahaayak kii niyukti kii baat to samaj aati he, lekin pis-aria (jahaan shanti he or yuddh ke halaat nahin hai) main yah tarksangat nahin he
 Now it will also be ascertained that no such work is being done with the officer working with the assistant, which is not in his duty of charter
 khud thalsena pramukh general bipin ravat kah chuke hai ki yah sahaayak system jise sena kii jubaan main baddi system bhi kaha jaataa he, behad acha he, or usamen adhikari ke juute or belt tak chamakaane kaa kaam shaamil he
 It has been seen many times that officers also do the work of other members of their family with these helpers
 mantralay ke mutabik sahaayakon se sainya adhikariyon ke parivaar waalon se jude kaamkaaj or ghar kaa kaamkaaj nahin karaayaa janaa chahie
 Although the military already has an auxiliary system audit every month, it is not strictly followed
 lekin raksha mantralay ke aadesh ke baad iskaa paalan kadai se kiya jayega
 The comments philhal thal sena sahaayak pratha ko khatm karne ke mood main nahin he, jabaki vayusena or nausena main ise khatm kar diya gaya he
 And this practice is neither in the Pakistan Army nor in the US Army
 thal sena pramukh general vipin ravat ne jis tarah se is pratha kii himaayat kii usase kai sawaal khadey hote hai
 Especially there can be no denial that work cannot be done without an assistant in many places, but it is also true that misuse is taking place due to which the dissatisfaction of the soldiers is coming through social media
 
 khud sena pramukh ne kaha ki thal sena main kareeb 36 hajaar adhikari hai
 Captains, Major rank officers and Commanding officers in the army get the same assistant
 upar kii rank ke adhikariyon ko do sahaayak milte hai
 The army chief definitely said that options are being sought to ensure that soldiers are not made serviceable in future
 aise kaaryon ke liye alag se sahaayak niyukt kiye ja sakate hai
 Experts say that the practice of giving assistants to the officer started around 1942 before independence
 amuman sahaayak kaa kaary adhikari ko jaruri kaary main madad karnaa or suraksha muhaiyaa karana hota tha
 But later they started doing many such works which are done by servant
 masalan juute polish karne se lekar kapade dhone tak kaa kaam
 If the wife of the army, Yagya Pratap Singh, who had made his complaint through social media, believes that his wife has been admitted to the Military Hospital of Bareilly and somehow he is declared mad and preparing to be removed from the army
 yajna pratap kii patni richa kii haalat ab kaaphi kharaab ho gai he kyonki vah apane pati ke prati sena ke adhikariyon ke kharaab vyavhaar ko lekar bhukh hadtaal par he
 When the condition worsened, the family admitted him to Rewa Hospital
 is samiksha main dekha jayega ki kya sena ke adhikari ke saath sahaayak ke taur par kaam kar rahe jawan, field ke saath-saath uske ghar par to tainaat nahin hai
 It will also be ascertained that these assistants are not engaged in work in the field as well as in the Peace Station with the officer's house and other family members
 yah sab pataa karne kaa aadesh raksha mantralay ne sena ko diya he
 The ministry has told the army that it is understandable to appoint assistants to help military officers in field stations, but this is not rational in the Peace-area (where there is peace and no war conditions)
 ab yah bhi pataa lagaaya jayega ki adhikari ke saath sahaayak kaa kaam kar rahe jawan se koi aisa kaam to nahin karaayaa ja rahaa jo uski duty of charter main nahin he
 Army Chief General Bipin Rawat himself has said that this auxiliary system, also known as the Buddy System in the Army's tongue, is very good, and involves polishing the officer's shoes and belt
 kai baar aisa dekha gaya he ki adhikari apane parivaar ke duusare sadasyon ke kaam bhi in sahaayakon se karaate hai
 According to the ministry, assistants should not be allowed to do work related to family members of military officers and housework
 haalanki sena main pehle se hi har maheene sahaayak system kaa audit hota he, lekin iskaa kadai se paalan nahin hota he
 But this will be followed strictly after the order of the Ministry of Defense
 tippaniyan At present, the Army is not in the mood to abolish the subsidiary practice, whereas it has been abolished in the Air Force and Navy
 or to or na to pakistan kii sena or na hi america kii sena main yah pratha he
 The way Army Chief General Vipin Rawat advocated this practice raises many questions
 khaskar is baat se koi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki kai jagahon par sahaayak ke bina kaam nahin chal saktaa he, lekin yah bhi sach he ki iskaa durupyog bhi bahut ho rahaa he jis vajah se javaanon kaa asantosh soshal media ke jariye samaane aa rahaa he
 The army chief himself said that there are about 36,000 officers in the army
 sena main captain, major rank ke adhikariyon or commanding adhikari ko ek hi sahaayak miltaa he
 Officers of the top rank get two assistants
 sena pramukh ne yah jarur kaha ki bhavishya main javaanon ko sevadaar na banaaya jaae iske vikalp talaashe ja rahe hai
 Separate assistants may be appointed for such tasks
 jaankaar bataate hai ki adhikari ko sahaayak dene kii pratha aazaadee se pehle 1942 ke aasapaas shuru hui thi
 Normally the job of assistant was to help the officer in necessary work and provide security
 lekin baad main inase kai aise kaam karaae jane lage jo kaam naukar se karaae jate hai
 For example, from polishing shoes to washing clothes
 sena main jis jawan yajna pratap singh ne soshal media ke jariye apni shikaayat kii thi uski patni kii maane to use bareli ke military aspataal main bhartee kara diya gaya he or kisi bhi tarah use pagal ghoshit kar sena se nikaalane kii taiyaari he
 Yagya Pratap's wife Richa's condition has now worsened as she is on hunger strike over the poor behavior of army officers towards her husband
 haalat bigadane par parivaar waalon ne use reva ke aspataal main bhartee karaayaa he
 Now it will also be ascertained that no such work is being done with the officer working with the assistant, which is not in his duty of charter
 khud thalsena pramukh general bipin ravat kah chuke hai ki yah sahaayak system jise sena kii jubaan main baddi system bhi kaha jaataa he, behad acha he, or usamen adhikari ke juute or belt tak chamakaane kaa kaam shaamil he

 Imran Khan may change cabinet
 Several reports released in PAK media may fall on many, including Chaudhary Chaudhary
 There has been a stir in Gazpakistan's politics these days
 america daura khatm kar apane desh waapas laute pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ab lagaataar bade badlaav kar rahe hai
 First, he removed Maliha Lodhi, the Pakistani representative to the United Nations, from his post and now it is reported that he can make changes in his cabinet
 is dauraan kai mantriyon kii chuttee ho sakati he yaa phir unka kaam badla ja saktaa he
 The list also includes the name of Fawad Chaudhary, who is constantly active on social media against India
 pakistani akhbaar don ke mutabik,imran khan kii ore se somvaar ko aise sanket die gaye ki jald hi unki cabinet main bade badlaav ho sakate hai
 On his return to Pakistan, Imran Khan called a meeting of his party, Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf, to discuss cabinet expansion
 is baithak main videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi bhi shaamil hue
 PTI leader and former finance minister Asad Umar told the Dawn newspaper that the PM could soon give him some big responsibility
 haalanki, unhone is baat kii pushti nahin kii ki cabinet main badlaav kab hoga
 According to Pakistani media, Imran Khan is not happy with some of his ministers and hence can leave him
 report ke anusaar imran khan ke mantrimandal main shafqat mahmud, jubaida jalaal, ejaj shah, fawaad choudhary, firdaus aashiq avam or nadeem afjal ke kaam main badlaav ho saktaa he yaa unhen mantrimandal se hataaya ja saktaa he
 Which big names will be discharged? It is worth mentioning that among the names that are going on in the Pakistani media, Fawad Chaudhary and Firdaus Aashiq Awam are more common in terms of India
 fawaad choudhary lagaataar soshal media par bharat ke khilaaf likhte rahete hai phir chaahe jammu-kashmir ko lekar baat ho yaa phir chandrayan-2 ko lekar kiya gaya twit, har baar vah bharat ke soshal media yugers ke nishane par rahete hai
 At the same time, Firdaus is the advisor of Aashiq Awam Imran Khan who constantly gives a statement on Kashmir
 maleeha lodhi ko UN se hatayagauratlab he ki sanyukt raashtra main jammu-kashmir ke masale par pakistan ko bada jhatka laga
 That is why Maliha Lodhi was removed from Imran Khan
 maleeha lodhi UN main pakistan kii pratinidhi thim jo lagaataar pakistan ke liye sharmindagi kaa kaaran ban rahi thim
 He gave Pakistan many times a reason to feel embarrassed on the international stage
 ab pakistan kii ore se munir akram ko UN bheja gaya he, jo pehle hi kai vivaadon main shaamil rah chuke hai

 Kuldeep and Chahal have troubled the world's best batsmen in the short format
 is bare main poochne par heden ne pitiai se kaha, ‘leg spinner aapako vikalp or vividhta dete hai
 Especially if you look at Kuldeep, his strong side is not how much he can spin the ball, but rather that his balls reach the batsman like Shane Warne's balls
 ’ye bhi padhein- jasprit bumraah ke is khaas ection ko exparts ne bataaya peeth ke liye khataraapane sheersh samay ke dauraan harbhajan singh or anil kumble ke khilaaf kaaphi safal rahe heden kaa haalanki maananaa he ki chahal kaa saamana kiya ja saktaa he
 He said, 'chahal is a different type of bowler
 vah stump par gendbaaji karte hai
 He throws flat and straight balls
 unhen drift nahin miltaa
 If i were a player, i would have preferred to face Chahal, as he would not get a drift
 ’australia ke liye 8000 se adhik test or 6000 se adhik vanade ran banane vaale heden ne anguli ke spinneron ke simit overon ke praaroop main adhik safal nahin hone ke sandarbh main kaha, ‘of spinneron ne ballebaajon ko rokane kii kala sikh lee thi, jiske kaaran ve nishchit samay tak haaavee rahe
 "he said," but now players have become accustomed to the flat balls of off-spinners
 of spinner gati main vividhta laane kii kala bhul gaye hai
 For this, Hayden gave the example of Nathan Lyon in the second ODI in Nagpur and compared the two spells of this off-spinner
 143 ran thok gabbar bole- aalochanaon kaa pataa nahin, apni duniya main jeeta humunhone kaha, ‘unke duusare spel ke dauraan gati 80 se 82 kimi prati ghante ke aasapaas thi, jo pehle spel main 90 se 92 kimi prati ghante thi
 It clearly had a shortfall of 10 kmph
 achaanak unhen khelnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Hayden has no doubt that if bowlers are to succeed, they will have to show such courage in limited overs cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘unke saath saahas kaa mudda hota he, jab ve ran nahin dena chaahate
 In Test matches, he becomes the wicket taker instead of stopping the run
 yahi antar he
 Hayden is happy that the Australian batsman was able to force Kedar Jadhav to bowl with a different line and length

 Our thinking is very clear that the investigation is going in the right direction at a fast pace

 The ED rejected the proposal for video conferencing because the ED director said that if banks want to resolve their dues by talking to the video conferencing for a long time, they can do so
 hamen isamen koi dikkat nahin he
 But in the case of ED, we are totally against this idea
 singh ne isaki vajah bataai ki poochtacha main sambandhit shaks agar jhooth bolta he yaa kuch chhipaata he to aamane-saamne poochtacha karte hue vah us vyakti ke chehre par najar aa jaataa he, lekin video conferencing main aisa nahin hota

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has landed in the battlefield to conquer the battle of Gujarat
 patidaar netaa hardik patel ne rahul gandhi se taj hotel main mulaakaat karke apni maange rakhi
 However, both Hardik and Congress deny the meeting
 lekin congress ke liye hardik kii maangen gale kii fans ban sakati hai
 It will not be easy for the Congress to fulfill these demands
 rahul-hardik mulakatahardik patel congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se mulaakaat se lakh inkaar karen, lekin ajtak ko mili hotel ke sisitivi se baat sabit hoti hai
 Hardik and Rahul have met in the 224 number room of the Taj Hotel
 rahul gandhi ke kamare main jane ke 10 minute baad hardik usee kamare main pravesh karte hai
 This is clearly visible in the CCTV footage
 hardik patel kii teen pramukh shartenhardik patel ne rahul gandhi se mulaakaat ke dauraan patidaar samaaj kii kai maange rakhi he
 Hardik has placed his conditions not only with Rahul but also in front of Congress in-charge Ashok Gehlot
 pehali shart patidaar aarakshan, duusari shart jeet hone par sarkaar main bhagidaari, teesri shart rashtradroh ke cese judaa he
 Hardik wants the Congress to clarify how and through which provision of the Constitution, if the Congress comes to power, it will give reservation to the Patidars
 congress agar satta main aati he to, sarkaar main patidaaron kii kitne pratishat netritv milegaa
 Along with this, said to withdraw the cases of sedition against Patidars and to take action against those responsible for killing Patidar youth
 iske alaava un siton par patidaar samudaay ke liye tikat kii maang kii he, jahaan patidaaron kii sankhya adhik he
 Hardik's demand for the Congress is the fulfillment of the conditions of subordinate trouble for the Congress
 hardik kii patidaar samudaay ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan kii maang ko puraa karnaa congress ke liye sabase musiibat kaa sabab he
 Currently 49 in Gujarat
 5 pratishat aarakshan lagu he, jise badhaayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 Because the Supreme Court orders that no more than 50 percent reservation can be given
 congress patidaaron ko obisi kii katagori main shaamil karti he, to obisi main naaraazgi bad sakati he
 The OBC community of Gujarat is considered a traditional voter of the Congress
 aise main congress apane mul voter ko naaraaz nahin kar sakati he
 Because at the time when the demand for Patel reservation was raised, the OBC community also raised the voice against the demand of the Patidars
 congress patidaaron ko sanvaidhanik taur par aarakshan kii maang ko puraa karnaa musiibat kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 It is difficult to give tickets to Hardik's followers
 Hardik's second demand is that Patel make his favorite Patidars a Congress candidate in majority seats
 sutron ke mutabik hardik ne congress se kareeb do darjan siton kii maang rakhi he
 If the Congress makes Hardik's favorite candidates, then those who are already preparing for the Congress
 unki naaraazgi kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Rahul had said that he will not give outsiders to the workers
 aise main hardik kii maangon ko puraa karnaa ke liye apni kahi baat ko rahul gandhi ko palatnaa hoga
 Apart from this, Hardik is also seeking a stake in the government, on which the Congress agrees, then Alpesh and Jignesh can also put their conditions in front of Rahul
 adhikariyon par karrwai kaise karenge?congress ke liye hardik kii is baat ko bhi puraa karne main mushkil khadi hogi
 There has also been talk of taking action against those responsible for killing Patidar youth during the movement, which is not easy for the Congress
 jabaki vahiin hardik patel par rashtradroh ke kesh ko waapas hataane main congress ko koi khaas dikkat nahin hogi

 beete saal sitambar main ye kooday kaa pahaad bharbarakar gir padaa jisamen do logon kii maut ho gai
 LG then decided to move the garbage from Ghazipur to outer Delhi's Ranikheda
 lekin ranikheda ke aasapaas ke logon ne andolan kiya to alji ko peeche hatana padaa or kooda phir se ghazipur main dalanaa shuru hua
 In order to be a place to dump garbage in Ghazipur, it was necessary to pick up the garbage already stored there
 sitambar kii ghatana ke turant baad alji ne kaha NHAI november 2017 se sadak banane ke liye ghazipur kaa kooda uthavaana shuru karegaa lekin aaj tak ek tinkaa nahin uthaa

 Out of which only 1000 tonnes are disposed of (waste is generated in the waste to energy plant) while 1600 tonnes of remaining waste contributes to increase the height of Ghazipur mountain
 jisase ghazipur main aaj kareeb 150 lakh ton kooda jamaa ho gaya he

 hamane unako pehle se zyaada paisa dene ke saath-saath lone bhi diya he jiskaa byaaj ham nahin kaat rahe kyonki hamako nigam kii aarthik haalat pataa he

 Only claims are being made in the place, so the patience of the Supreme Court was bound to be broken
 purvi dilli kii ghazipur landphil site, jisamen kooday ke pahaad kii oonchai 60 meter pahunch gai he
 If this condition remains, then in no time it will overtake Qutub Minar, whose height is 73 meters
 yahaan kooda daalane kii lagbhag 25 meter oonchai kii limit 16 saal pehle 2002 main khatm ho chuki he
 In September last year, this mountain of garbage fell down in which two people died
 iske baad alji ne kooda ghazipur kii jagah bahari dilli ke ranikheda main daalane kaa faisla kiya
 But as the people around Ranikheda agitated, the LG had to retreat and the garbage began to fall again in Ghazipur
 gajipur main kooda daalane kii jagah bane iske liye vahaan se pehle se jamaa kooda uthaane kii zarurat thi
 Soon after the September incident, LG said that NHAI would start picking up garbage from Ghazipur to build the road from November 2017 but a straw was not picked up till date

 jisamen se 1000 ton kaa hi nistaaran ho paata he (west tu energy plant main kooda khapaakar bijli banati he) jabaki 1600 ton bachaa hua kooda ghazipur ke pahaad kii oonchai badhaane main yogadan detaa he
 Due to which about 150 lakh tonnes of garbage has accumulated in Ghazipur today
 tippaniyan East Delhi Municipal Corporation is not able to pay salaries for the remaining three months except class-4 employees, where will they spend the waste disposal and the new landfill site

 The Modi government at the center has been under attack from the opposition ever since the 500 and 1000 notes were discontinued
 pradhanantri narendra modi ke notebandi ke faisle ke khilaaf vipaksh ekajute hokar sarkaar kii aalochana karne main kaa koi mauka haath se nahin jane de rahaa he

 If there was preparation for ten months, then where is the money? On the other hand, Prime Minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, who is against Modi, said that the situation is getting worse every minute due to the closure of the note
 unhone gambhir aarope lagaate hue kaha ki centre sarkaar kii is faisle ke peeche koi planning nahin thi

 In Rajasthan, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and controversial cds do not seem to be left out
 agar sutron kii maane to aane vaale samay main kai or sidi janata ke saamne hongi
 While the CBI in the midwife Bhanwari Devi murder case says that she was murdered because she was blackmailing then PHED minister Mahipal Maderna and MLA Malkhan Singh Bishnoi
 vah unke saath bane antarang sambandhon kii baat ko saarvajanik karne kii baat kah kar dhamkaaya karti thi
 However, CBI has so far only offered a video CD which is already public
 is sidi main bhavari devi ke saath mahipal singh dikh rahe hai
 Malkhan Singh is accused in this case because he is accused of being the father of Bhanwari Devi's third child (daughter)
 sibiai ne malakhan singh kii bahan indira bishnoi ko bhavari devi kii hatya kaa mukhya aaropee banaate hue iske peeche uskaa hi dimag bataaya he
 Indira was seen everywhere when the CBI was investigating
 isliye har koi yah sawaal kar rahaa he ki kahin sibiai ne jaan-bujhkar ek mahatvapurn mode par use bhaagane or bhumigat ho jane kaa to mauka nahin de diya taaki vah indira par aarope laga sake or uski giraftaar se pehle koi or vyakti doshamukt ho jaae
 There is undoubtedly a systematic pattern in the CBI investigations and arrests in this case
 zyaadaatar aropiyon ko tab giraftaar kiya gaya jab hiraasat main rahane vaale pichley aaropee ko jail bhej diya gaya
 Many of these people were arrested when the previous accused were released
 is tarah bahut kam logon se ek saath poochtacha ho pai he
 Malkhan and Mahipal were arrested after filing the first charge sheet
 jab tak sibiai teesri chargeshit daakhil karti tab tak pichley do logon ke khilaaf sakshya kamjor pad gaye
 Whatever be the case, the cbi's credibility is at stake in the Bhanwari Devi case
 kai ghatnaon se aise sanket milte hai ki vah jaanch karne vaali nahin balki lipapoti vaali agency kii tarah kaam kar rahi he, kam se kam kuch varisht afasaron or netaaon ko bachaane ke liye to prayasarat he hi, jinke saath bhavari devi or kathith rup se uske saath kaam karne vaali anya ladakiyon ke shaareerik sambandh the
 Two major newspapers in Rajasthan had published reports on the front page that the CBI had obtained about 150 cds related to the Bhanwari Devi case, but the CBI denied these reports
 ab kuch or video cliping gum rahi hai jisamen barmer jile ke ek vidhayak fun sate dikh rahe hai
 It is clear that the MLA who is suspected to be in them is nervous, the rest who know that they cannot be in VCD, they are having fun
 india today ko apni jaanch se pataa chalaa he ki kuch logon ko bachaane ke liye bhavari devi maamle main lipapoti kii sajeesh rachi gai he
 The CBI has worked out of the box to gather evidence on how some suspects have tried to inject suspicion towards Mahipal Madarena
 usne apni chargeshit main ullekh kiya he ki kai adhikariyon sahit bahut se log bhavari devi ke prabhaav main the
 Why does the CBI not reveal the names of such people? How did she back down from doing so, while such people may be involved in crime or not guilty of murder, other than that they may be involved in some work and perhaps facing criminal charges Are there people too? It is an important issue that the CBI ignored those who may have links with the alleged gang of Bhanwari Devi and her girls
 kya yah usne jaan-bujhkar kiya he or yah lipapoti kaa hi hissaa he?sibiai ne jodhpur haai court ke samaksh ek yachika daayar kar aropiyon ko pakadaney main rajasthan police kaa sahyog maanga tha
 When the Jodhpur Police appointed an SP for this, the CBI insisted on giving DIG rank officer
 jaipur main grih vibhaag ne ek khaas adhikari ko kaam main lagaaya jo chizon ko dhakne ke liye kukhyat hai
 All this was part of the daub game
 itnaa hi kaaphi nahin tha, sibiai ne ek aise adhikari ko niyukt kiya jisaki bhavari devi maamle main mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi thi
 Was this exercise to continue the cbi's smug campaign? Sources also say that more cds are likely to appear at the right time
 sach ko zyada der tak chipaaya nahin ja saktaa
 Pakistan is a stronghold of terrorism
 pehali baar rus se ye aawaaj ai he
 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has said that the stronghold of terror present in Pakistan is a threat to him and his allies and has to be dealt with together
 ab rus ke maathe par bhi bal pad gadha he
 Russia is also troubled by the terror factory in Pakistan
 rus ko bhi lagane laga he ki pakistan main panapata aatankwaad duniya ke liye khatra he
 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has clearly told his security service to work with his international allies to counter the terrorist threat emerging from Pakistan and Afghanistan
 rus kii fedral security sarvice yani ennesabi ke top adhikariyon kii baithak main medvedev ne kaha ki pakistan or afghanistan jaise desh main maujuud aatank ke garh hamaare or hamaare sahyogiyon ke hiton par atikaraman he
 We must join the international counter-terrorism community to destroy the stronghold of terror
 ennesabi ke liye ahm chunauti he
 Significantly, the FSP is a successor to the Soviet Union-era security agency KGB
 isse pehle sansad ke nichle sadan duma ke sansadeey dal ke pratinidhiyon kii baithak main medvedev ne pakistan ke talibanikaran par chintaa kaa izhaar kiya tha
 Apparently Medvedev's concern is a seal on India's claim that the terrorists are using the territory of Pakistan, but Pakistan does not believe it

 The host of the show asked Kevin if his daughters had become comfortable with Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner
 Kevin answered this question and said, yes now they are comfortable
 haalanki shuruyaat main meri choti beti ke liye ye thodaa mushkil tha
 She is very close to Nick and is very protective of him, so whenever Priyanka meets Nick and puts her hand on his shoulder, Valentina feels very bad
 agar vamletina nik ke aasapaas hoti to wo priyanka kaa haath tak jhidak detii thi
 However, Valentina gradually realized that she was part of his family and she became comfortable with Priyanka

 priyanka ne isai reeti-rivaazon ke saath hi saath hindu wedding bhi rachaai thi
 Priyanka is currently working with Farhan Akhtar in the film 'the Sky is Pink'
 is film ko shonali bose diarect kar rahi hai or is film main dangal girl jaayra shaikh bhi ahm bhoomika main nazar aaengi
 The film is eagerly awaiting the release of Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Kapoor's film Tamasha, directed by Imtiaz Ali
 bataa den ki 'tamaasha' ke diarector imtiyaaj ali hai
 And after 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani', he is bringing Deepika and Ranbir together again
 film tamaasha kii kahani crosika main deepika or ranbir kii ek khaas mulaakaat or dosti ke ird gird gumti he
 But this friendship and love entails a new twist
 'ye javaani he divaani ' ke baad deepika or ranbir is film main saath najar aaenge
 The film will be released on November 27
 dekhen film'tamaasha'kaa trailor:utivi moshan pikchars kii is film ko imtiyaaj ali ne diarect kiya he
 Deepika herself informed via Twitter that the film's trailer will launch on 22 September
 taran adarsh ne apane twitor acount par utyub kaa link share kiya
 In Tamasha, Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, who were in an affair at some time, will not be seen as one night stand but will soon be seen together in director Imtiaz Ali's film Tamasha
 lekin bataaya ja rahaa he ki is film ki kahani pichhali lav stories kii tarah nahin hogi
 It has a new concept of romance
 ranbir or deepikaki maane to isamen do ajanabiyon ke bich van nite stand nahin balki van-holiday stand dekhne ko milegaa
 In this film, Ved (ranbir) and Tara (deepika) are off in search of a new place
 lekin do ajanabi aamtaur par jaise milte hai, pyaar main padate hai yaa alag ho jate hai, vaisaa routine masala isamen nahin he
 In the film, the two characters plan to keep their true identities secret while meeting each other
 wo ek duusare se kisi or kirdaar ke rup main milte hai, saath ghoomte hai, masti karte hai or vaikeshan khatm hone par ek duusare se dobaaraa kabhi na milane kaa vaada karte hai
 Parts of the same story have also been shown in the film's trailers, due to which the audience has been very keen since the trailer launch
 trailor main bhi veda or tara kroeshia main ek duusare se jhooth bolne kii kasam khate dikhaae gaye hai
 On one hand, while Veda describes himself as the don of 'don', Tara describes herself as Mona Darling
 traiders dekhe kar bhi lagata he ki 'lav aaj kal', 'brake ke baad' yaa aisi tamaam modern lav stories kii tarah is film main boring brake-ap jaisi chijen nahin hai
 ranbir-deepika did an Intense liplock scene for 'tamasha', Kapoor Kapoor and Deepika Padukone did a tremendous love-making scene for their upcoming film 'tamasha'
 is seen main donon actors kii lip-tu-lip kis dikhaai he, jise kaaphi intens bataaya ja rahaa he
 a source from the production team also got a little idea about the film's story
 film kii kahani do aise jawan logon ke ird-gird gumti he jo ajanabiyon kii tarah corsika main milte hai
 Both want a little break from their everyday life
 majaak majaak main donon dyside karte hai ki wo french island par saath main ek juthi jindagi jienge jisamen wo dev anand or don se lekar mona darling ke kirdaar nibhaate hai
 But both of them fall in love in an unwanted way
 juthi acting kii jagah asli imoshans saamne aate hai
 This love making scene of the film is not very long but is definitely hot and intense
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki donon actors kaa yah kising seen 'bachanaa i haseenon' ke kising seen se bhi zyada intens he
 The film stars Ranbir as a story-teller and Deepika is his inspiration
 dekhen: film 'tamaasha' main deepika or ranbir kapur ke gaanon kii mekkingis film kaa haal hi main shandaar gaanaa matargashti relies hua he
 Right now the other fun songs of the film are also ready for release soon

 The team's leg-spinner Rashid spent just 17 in four overs in that match and took two wickets
 hyderabad ko raashid se ek baar phir aise hi pradarshan kii ummid hogi
 In batting, the team mostly relies on David Warner and Johnny Bairstow
 donon ballebaajon ne chennai ke khilaaf pehle wicket ke liye 66 ranon kii saajhedaari kii thi

 KKR is also heavily dependent on some players and the most important name of these is Russell who has 220 so far
 46 kii ausat se 377 ran banaae hai jisamen 39 chakke shaamil hai
 Russell has expressed a desire to come up the order and there is a possibility that he could be dropped at number four in this match depending on the circumstances

 Azam Khan pointed to Modi and said, "after the Lok Sabha elections, elected leaders choose their Prime Minister
 yahaan pehle se hi pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar banakar chunaav lard rahe hai
 It is a violation of constitutional traditions
 ' unhone aarope lagaaya hue kaha 'chunaav ayog khuleam bijepi kaa sahyog kar rahaa he or use uske chunaav daftar kii tarah sevaayen de rahaa he

 The incident in Paris has again brought us to the questions that we know the answer to, but each time the answer falls somewhat short
 in sawaalon ke naam har baar alag hote hai
 Sometimes the question of freedom of expression, the question of hurt feelings, the question of generosity and tolerance on tolerance, from provocation to questions of respect
 ye vahi sawaal the jinke haq main paris or landan kii sadakon par ghatana ke turant baad hi hazaron log sadak par utar aae
 Those who could not get down in their respective countries came on Twitter and i am Sharlee, went viral
 badi sankhya main logon ne khud ko sharli ke banaae cartoon se jod liya
 People hurt by the incident also condemned the killing
 kuch log cartoon kaa samarthan kar rahe the to kuch cartoon kii bhi ninda kar rahe the
 Some were saying that if these cartoons were bad then they could also be ignored
 ninda karne waalon main ve bhi shaamil the jo apane dharmik pratikon ke khilaaf sharli abdo jaise cartoon kattai bardaasht nahin karte
 Defamation litigators and bloggers on Facebook were also condemning it
 main bhi blog karata hum
 The question arose as to how far the freedom of the accused was also asked why the limit should be fixed
 kyon nahin, jahaan tak man kare vahaan tak
 Today, a blasphemy accused was killed in Takshashila near Islamabad after his release from court
 use kabristaan tak main jagah nahin mili
 So had to be buried in his own house
 maansik rup se biimaar yah vyakti khud ko paigambar bataa rahaa tha
 Do you know what happened to India's famous painter Maqbool Fida Hussain

 Yesterday, when people were thinking about those who died, they were questioning how many Muslim countries have condemned it
 khayr arab deshon se lekar pakistan tak ne kii he
 i do not know what was achieved by the condemnation of Pakistan, who was hanged and shot due to blasphemy
 france main 250 muslimon kii ek pratinidhi sanstha he usne bhi is ghatana kii ninda kii he
 a Muslim thinker named Tariq Ramadan wrote that Pangbar has not been avenged but betrayed by our religion and its principles
 hamaare sahyogi aseem ne enditiidotkam par likhaa he ki islam ke apmaan ke naam par bhadakne vaale har musalmaan ko khud se yah sawaal karnaa chahie ki khud paigambar aisi sthiti main kya karte
 Every child has been taught since childhood how tolerant Prophet Mohammad was for criticism and abuses
 paigambar mohammad ke vivaadaaspad cartoon to patrika kai saalon se bana rahi he
 There was also an attack on the office and protests
 lekin baat yahaan tak kabhi nahin pahunchi
 It is not clear whether the killing has been done due to the printing of cartoons by the ICC terrorist organization Baghdadi
 sharli abdo main islam se lekar isai yahudee dharmik pratikon ke khilaaf bhi cartoon bane hai
 There is also the intention of making cartoons and cartoons in the realm of debate
 france main 70 kaa dashak yuvaaon ke baghawat kaa dashak tha
 Anti-religious satire was also done in this period
 yah patrika usee daur or maansikta kii paidaaish he
 Someone has written that now nobody even takes notice of this magazine
 kyonki aaj kaa france kaaphi badal gaya he
 Nevertheless, there are many opinions about cartoons
 kai log cartoon ko foohad or uksaau maanate hai
 Even after Twitter went viral on Facebook, many big newspapers have not published cartoons
 par cartoon kaa virodh karne vaale hatya kii bhi utani hi ninda kar rahe hai
 Jacob Kenfield has written that the cartoons of Charley Abdo have been horribly racist, sexist and superstitious
 neuyark times main ross dowthat ne likhaa he ki koi samaaj kitna udaar he isse pataa chalaa he ki usamen ishaninda sahan karne kii kitni kshamta he
 For freedom of expression it is necessary that we also accept the freedom to offend
 isiilie cartoon kharaab hone ke baad bhi ishaninda ke adhikaar kaa bachaav karnaa zaruri he kyonki agar kuch log kuch kehane par maar sakate hai to wo baat kahi jaani chahie
 Verna that is violent will have a veto on the Liberal order
 lekin yah bhi nahin ho ki uksaane ke liye hi baat likhi jaae or log bhadak jaaen to azaadi kaa cover lene lage
 But if someone taunts a gun, he has to defend the freedom to say
 azaadi or sahishnutaa ke maamle main france kii duniya main alag jagah he
 This incident has happened there
 aisi ghatnaon ko abhivyakti kii azaadi tak hi simit rakhen yaa ham yah bhi dekhen ki kyon har dharm main kattarpanthi tatv badhate ja rahe hai
 Why intolerance is on the rise
 kyon france ke noujvaan alqaida or isis ke liye kaam karne ja rahe hai
 Why are we not able to control terrorism? agar saare kaaran dharmik hi hai to peshawar main bacchon ko maarane vaale to alag mazahab ke nahin the
 Freedom of expression is not only in crisis due to religious insanity
 sarkaar, sena, puunjipati or kai baar media ke kaaran bhi sankat main he
 What questions are we mainly dealing with the Paris incident? aakhir dharm ke naam par ham is paagalpan se kaise nipten
 Whether disrespecting religion or setting a limit for expression
 kya ham dharm ke liye aalochana kii jagah banane main naakaam rahe hai

 bhartiya naagarik kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle main 25 disambar kaa din behad ahm he kyonki pakistan ne isi din maa or patni se milane ke liye apane yahaan jail main band kulbhushan se milane kaa mauka diya
 Pakistan suddenly picked up Jadhav, a former Indian soldier, 21 months ago from the Iranian border in March 2016 and then jailed
 baad main unhen faansee kii sajaa bhi suna di
 Meanwhile, Pakistan constantly tried to avoid the gritty at the international level
 ab vah maanavtaa ke aadhaar par khud ko dariyadil bataa rahaa he
 You know how 21 such legends of Pakistan have put a person's life in trouble
 pehla pintarajadhav maamle main pakistan ne pehla pintara 3 march, 2016 ko chalaa jab usne bhartiya naagarik jadhav ko aatank kii sajeesh rachane or jasusi karne ke aarope main iran seemaa par giraftaar kar liya
 However, India claims that Jadhav was kidnapped from the Iran border
 doosraa pintarampak sena ne 3 hafte baad 24 march ko daawa kiya ki jadhav research and enlysis wing (ro) ke agent hai or paak-iran seemaa ke nikat jaahidaan ke dakshin-purv sthit saraavaan ke paas se pakadaa gaya tha
 Third Maneuver: On 26 March of the same year, Pakistan issued summons to the Indian Embassy alleging that the RAW officer was illegally entered into Pakistan and later engaged in subversive activities in Baluchistan and Karachi
 bharat ne isse inkaar kiya or bataaya ki sarkaar ke saath uskaa ab koi link nahin he
 He retired from the army in 2002
 "chauthaa pintrah29 march ko pakistan ne apni safai main ek video jari kiya jisamen jadhav ko maafee maangate hue dikhaaya gaya
 Jadhav is seen saying that he is an officer in the Indian Army and works for RAW
 bharat ne turant iskaa khandan kiya or aarope lagaaya ki is video main chhedchhad kiya gaya he
 Fifth maneuver: In April 2016, the provincial government of Baluchistan of Pakistan lodged an FIR against Jadhav for plotting terror and sabotage
 chatha pintarapakistan (7 disambar, 2016) ne jadhav maamle main phir nayaa sur saadhaa
 Now Pakistan's Prime Minister's Foreign Affairs Advisor Sartaj Aziz claimed that the evidence given on Jadhav is not enough

 com / or7tf8i8pn bihar ke logon kii seva karne kaa jo avasar mila he, uske liye main abhaari hum
 Historians say with confidence that the glorious history of ancient India is the history of ancient Bihar
 vaise aaj ye aam jaankaree he ki bihar bharat kaa sabase garib rajya he or agar iske aakaar ke duniya bhar ke rajyon se isaki alag se tulana kii jaae to ye duniya kaa sabase garib rajya he
 Is this everything? i don't think so main maanata hum ki bihar desh main bahut badi sambhaavnaaon vaala rajya he or viksit bharat kii kahani viksit bihar kii kahani ke bina sambhav nahin he
 i have been working to change it into reality, will keep doing it
 bihar kii majbooti, kamazori, iske avasar or isaki pragati kii chunautiyon ke bahut saral vishleshan se bhi bihar kii sambhaavna ko rekhaankit kiya ja saktaa he
 The strength of Bihar lies in its people - especially the women here, the youth here, its fertile land, its abundant water sources, its rich heritage of thousands of years and the rapidly spreading multi-skilled non-resident Biharis
 saath hi saath, bihar ke bahut saare kamazor morche bhi hai
 Bihar lagged behind the rest of the country in the development of infrastructure and institutions, which is not the case of other prosperous and better developed states in India
 buniyadi dhaanche or sansthaanon kii kami ne gyaan srijan main ek badi kami ko janm diya he
 Apart from this, Bihar is surrounded by land all around
 jharkhand ke bihar se alag hone ke baad, bihar ke paas prakritik sansaadhan bhi nahin rah gaye
 So there are some inherent weaknesses that the state has to grapple with
 baharhaal, bhavishya ujjwal he
 No one can take away the strength of Bihar, while it can be worked out systematically to overcome its weaknesses
 isi bindu par sabase zyaada avasar bane hue hai
 No other state can benefit from good governance and policy making as much as Bihar
 yah centre sarkaar kii zimmedaari he ki vah desh ke bheetar badhati vikaraal gairbarabari ko sahaayak niti nirmaan ke zarie dur kare
 Special state status is one such policy step
 bihar main buniyadi dhaanche kii barabari hasil karne ke liye sadak, rail, bijli, shiksha or swasthya main nivesh karne bhar se rajya kii arthvyavastha raftaar pakad legi
 Leadership and governance will play an important role in ensuring that Bihar gets its due and projects are completed on time to achieve the necessary infrastructural and institutional development
 aaj bihar takanic kii madad se vikaas ke kai dag ek saath bhar saktaa he
 Equipped with digital capability, Bihar can provide better level of education, health facilities and social welfare in an economical manner
 rajya ke mul buniyadi dhaanche kii behatari, behatar shiksha or yuvaaon ke prashikshan, durust kanoon-vyavastha or bijli kii uplabdhta nivesh or udhyamita kii behad zaruri buniyaad rakh degi
 The loan from banks will play a very important role in promoting private sector development
 is frem main, aap jahaan bhi dekhen, nivesh kii ek bhoomika he- chaahe vah buniyadi suvidha ke vikaas main ho, naujavaanon ke kaushal or gyaan ko badhaava dene main ho yaa nivesh or udhyamita ko sakasham banane main ho
 The investment case in Bihar is simple and it will give time bound benefit to the investors, the state and society
 iske alaava kheti ke khaake par bhi kaam chalata rahanaa chahie, jo bharat ko duusari harith kranti kii taraf le jane ke liye rajya dwaara khinchaa gaya he, jisaki main aksar ek renbo revolution (satarangi kranti) kii tarah kalpana karata hum
 Bihar is a state of small farmers who have the most fertile land in the country
 kheti kaa khaakaa saafe taur par aisa nitigat drushtikon banaata he jisase kheti mahatvapurn dhang se or utpaadak ho sake
 Urbanization is another important area where opportunities exist in Bihar
 aaj bihar ke nau main se ek hi aadmi shahari ilaake main rahata he
 It has to grow naturally and at least double in the next ten years
 rajya is surat kaa phayda uthaa saktaa he, bas yah sunishchit karke ki bihar ke shahari centre behatar dhang se niojit hon, vahaan bijli ho or ve rojgaar srijan ke lungar ban saken
 With modern technology, this can be achieved with far better speeds and assured results
 bihar ke liye ek ahm mauqaa rajya ke anivaasee logon kaa kaa bahut bad aadhaar he jinke paas tarah-tarah ke kaushal hai or dher saare sansaadhan hai
 His bond with the state is not limited to the property and his extended family that is living in the state, but it is a deep emotional connection and motivates him to work for the development of Bihar
 main ise bahut badi sambhaavna ke taur par dekhtaa hum ki anivaasee bihariyon ke gyaan, sadhano or unki aakankshaon ko rajya ke vikaas ke mudde kii taraf modaa ja saktaa he
 i am fully aware of the dangers that Bihar is constantly facing
 ek to, rajya prakritik aapadaaon- khaaskar baadh or akaal kaa maaraa he
 Already this increased risk could be greater in view of climate change
 duusare, hamaare behad ghani aabaadi vaale or garib rajya main jati or dharm ahm bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Therefore, Bihar is also an easy victim of injustice, inaction and divisive forces
 jahaan sakriy shashan se prakritik aapadaa ke khataron ko kam kiya ja saktaa he, vahiin saamaajik morche par rajya ko sahansheel banane kaa iklauta upaay nyaay ke saath vikaas kaa nazariyaa he
 The government of Bihar should be such that it can develop, reach its benefits to the weakest sections, and continuously strengthen social harmony
 duniya main kahin bhi kisi garib rajya ko baantne vaali niti or raajnneeti se nahin badla gaya he
 So the only way for Bihar to move forward is development with strong leadership, good governance and justice
 rajya kii majbooti, kamazori, uske avasaron or khataron kaa yah saral vishleshan bhi rajya kii betahasha sambhaavnaaon ko saamne rakh detaa he
 My imagination is to embody this possibility
 majbootiyon kaa puraa-puraa istemaal karnaa hoga- naujavaanon main aage badhane or yogadan karne kaa hunar hasil karnaa hoga, mahilaon ko samaaj main apni samuchit bhoomika nibhaani hogi
 Our land productivity must be increased, the use of water resources must be made productive and people around the world have to experience their rich cultural heritage
 kamazoriyon ko kam karnaa hoga
 Whatever you have to do for it
 bihar ko aadharbhoot dhaanche, sansthaaon or gyaan ke maamle main barabari hasil kerani he
 It is the responsibility of the state and central government
 aksar log bihar ke chuke hue maukon kii baat karte hai
 not anymore
 meri kalpana aisa drushtikon viksit karne kii he jisase bihar apane avasaron kaa puraa istemaal karegaa
 Our young boys and girls - and they are in crores - will be better trained and capable than the people of any other state
 hamaare nagar or shahar behatar jivan str or rojgaar ke avasar muhaiyaa karaayenge
 And the state will grow into a hub of entrepreneurs and investors
 saath hi, hamaare gaanv aatmanirbhar or jeevant honge
 This time Bihar will not only join the second Green Revolution, but will lead it
 jahaan main in lakshyon kii ore kaam kar rahaa hum, main logon ke liye sabase ahm sandesh bhi saafe kar duun
 i will take up creating a state that is free from the shadow of the story of misrule forever
 yah khyal or dar ki bihar kabhi bhi gairzimmedaar hukumat or kanoon-vyavastha kii ore laut saktaa he, logon ke dilo-dimag se dur hona chahie
 My core strength is the ability to provide good governance, overall development and social harmony
 jaisaa ki maine beete nau saalon main koshish kii he, meri hasarat ek aisa rajya banane kii he jahaan majbooti sansthagat ho jaae
 And i want to continue this effort always, to create a state that can carry forward the story of positive future, vibrant culture and sustainable harmony
 or ye hasil karne main, main bihar ke haq main bharat sarkaar or mananeey pradhanmantri ke saath tatparta ke saath kaam karuunga
 In the four decades from 1971 to 2011, the population of Hindus in the country has more than doubled to more than 96
62 million, although their participation in the total population has decreased by almost three per cent

 gujral sarkaar se samarthan waapas lenaa kya congress kii bhul thi?gujral sarkaar ke baad hue chunaav main NDA kii sarkaar banipurv raashtrapati pranav mukherjee kii maane to gujral sarkaar se congress ne samarthan waapas lekar apni hi raah main kaante bone kaa kaam kiya he
 Speaking in Delhi on Wednesday on the 100th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Indra Kumar Gujral, Pranab Mukherjee said that if the Congress had not withdrawn support from the Gujral government in 1997, it might have prevented the BJP from coming to power in 1998
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki congress ne gujral sarkaar se samarthan waapas lekar bijepi ko satta main aane kaa mauka de diya
 Pranab Mukherjee said that in 1998, he might have prevented BJP from coming to power
 gujarat sarkaar hamaare (congress ke) samarthan se apana kaarykaal puraa kar sakati thi
 He said that Gujral was in talks with Sitaram Kesari
 tab main bhi vahaan par tha
 He said that when the DMK had no clear connection with the (rajiv Gandhi) assassination then why should he be excluded from the coalition government? Gujral was formed in 1997, the PM former President said that despite this he also took the risk of his government
 congress ne gujral sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya
 Everyone knows what happened next March
 bijepi ne 180 se zyada siten jiti or satta main aane kaa mauka mil gaya
 NDA government was formed in 1998
 is dauraan pranav mukherjee ne indra kumaar gujral kii videsh niti kii bhi tarif kii
 Let me tell you that former PM Inder Kumar Gujral was the Prime Minister of the country from 21 April 1997 to 19 March 1998
 30 november, 2012 main 92 varsh kii umr main gujral kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 Mukherjee has mentioned in his book that former President Pranab Mukherjee has also mentioned the case of withdrawal of support from Gujral government in his book 'coalition Years: 1996--2012'
 unhone kitaab main likhaa he ki 1997 main congress ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh seetaram kesari ne pradhanmantri banane kii apni mahatvakanksha ke liye gujral kii sarkaar ko giraaya tha
 Mukherjee has written that the Congress demanded withdrawal of support from the Gujral government following the interim report of the Jain Commission investigating the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi
 jain ayog kii report main kaha gaya tha ki diemke or iskaa netritv littey pramukh ve prabhakaran or uske samarthakon ko badhaava dene main shaamil tha
 Whereas no leader or any political party was involved in the conspiracy
 congress gujral sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan de rahi thi
 The support from the Gujral government on the pretext of the DMK wrote that during the winter session of Parliament in 1997, several meetings were held in an effort to alleviate the crisis
 tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indrakumar gujral ne seetaram kesari, pranav mukherjee, jitendra prasad, arjuna singh or sharad pavaar samet congress netaaon ko apane nivas par ratribhoj par bulaayaa tha
 During this time, Gujral said that there is no direct evidence of any DMK leader joining it
 aisi sthiti main diemke ke khilaaf karrwai se galat sandesh jayega or saath hi sarkaar ko ek party ke dabaav main kaam karne vaali mana jayega
 Mukherjee wrote that we told Gujral that he would put his point in the Congress Working Committee and the committee would take a final decision on it
 congress ke adhiktar sadsy sarkaar se samarthan lene ke paksh main nahin the
 Despite this, the committee passed a resolution withdrawing support from the government

 Jawaharlal Nehru University, Calcutta University and Madras University remain in the second, fourth and fifth positions respectively
 6 se lekar 10 tak agle paanch sthanon main zyaadaatar badlaav hua he to isliye ki mumbai vishvavidhyalay, bangaloru sthit indian institute of science or jadavapur vishvavidhyalay ne, jo kramshah chathe, aathven or nauven sthaan par the, is saal surveykshan main hissaa nahin liya
 There were some compulsions with him due to which he could not send the necessary data till the last date of publication

 In Asia, Delhi University is ranked 77th, Calcutta University 116th, Pune University 142nd and Mumbai University 145th
 iity sansthaanon ko chhodkar bharat ne aise paryaapt stareey santhaan taiyaar nahin kiye hai jo asia ke bhi sarvshereshth vishvavidhyalayon se hode kar saken
 There are a total of 538 universities recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) of the Central Government in India
 samasya yah he ki sarvshereshth 45 vishvavidhyalayon ke baad baaki 493 kaa str teji se gaayab hota jaataa he
 Even in the best 45, there is a significant difference in quality between the top 15 and the rest
 kai log gyaan aadhaarit agali mahashakti ke rup main bharat ke utthan ko lekar mugalate ke shikaar hai

 Britain's Oxford and Cambridge universities have broken the US monopoly by making it to that list
 agar china or bharat antat america ko pachhaadna chaahate hai to unhen aise vishvavidhyalay banane honge jo behtareen shaikshik pratibhaaon ko america se aakarshith kar saken
 Just as America attracted talent from Britain in the 20th century
