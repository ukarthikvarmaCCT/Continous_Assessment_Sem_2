 But Shefali's husband Parag Tyagi is not happy about this
 wo apni patni ke saport main aa gaye hai
 What did Parag write in a social media post? Paragana has lambasted Kamya by writing a post on social media
 paraag ne likhaa- 'kamya main tumhaara or tumhaari parformens kaa bahut bada fain hum
 You are one of the great actors
 meri patni ko lekar aapke rivyuu se main sahamat nahin hum
 i want to know how and when Shefali broke Siddharth and Aseem's friendship

 "shefali only told Rashmi that she should sit with Arhaan and sort out all the things
 to rashmi ne kaha tha ki ghar main ghar main ye sab chijen sulajh nahin sakati
 On this, Shefali told them that they should go outside the house and do everything right
 kyonki shefali ke liye relationships se badhkar kuch nahin he
 And remind you that it was not Shefali who asked Rashmi to file a case against Shahnaz
 wo hindustani bhaau the, jinhone aisa kaha tha
 Shefali needed to know that emotions have no place in Bigg Boss house
 ye ek game he
 So thank you very much for reminding Shefali

 The Indian Air Force has avenged the martyrdom of 40 soldiers in a suicide attack on 14 February in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir
 mangalvaar al subah vayusena ke miraj 2000 ladaaku vimaanon ne pakistan sthit 3 aatanki camp par hamalaa kiya jisamen jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankwaadi, varisht commander, prashikshak or aatanki hamalon ke prashikshan ke liye aae jihadi samoohon kaa safaya ho gaya
 The attack also put the terror training camp of Balakot, the most secure hideout of Jaish
 bhartiya vayusena kii karrwai kii jaankaree dete hue videsh sachiv vijay gokhale ne bataaya ki vishwast gopneey sutron se jaankaree mili thi ki jaish-e-mohammad desh ke vibhinn hisson main ek or aatmghaatee aatanki hamale ko anjaam dene kii koshish kar rahaa tha or iske liye fidaayin jihadiyon ko prashikshit kiya ja rahaa tha
 Government sources were quoted as saying that Maulana Masood Azhar's son Abdullah underwent advanced training in December 2017 at jaish-e-mohammed's camp in Balakot
 sutron kaa daawa he ki pulavama hamale kii sajeesh bhi balakot camp main hi hui thi
 In the last 3 months, Jaish trained 60 jihadis and Abdul Rashid Ghazi, the mastermind of the Pulwama attack, also took training in Balakot
 bataa den ki pulavama hamale ke 100 din baad hui sainya karrwai main gaji dher ho gaya tha
 Jaish commander Abdul Rashid Ghazi entered Kashmir in December 2018 and was preparing the youth for a suicide attack
 sutron ke mutabik balakot camp main kul 6 badi barrack thim or isaki kshamta badhaane ke liye nirmaan kaary jari tha
 In Balakot camp, 300 terrorists including the commander were present at all times
 balakot camp ke sanchaalan masood ajahar kaa saalaa yusuf ajahar kar rahaa tha
 Yusuf was in contact with the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI while training new jihadis
 khufia sutron ke mutabik isse pehle balakot camp aatanki sanghathan hijb-ul-mujahiddeen kaa training centre tha jise kuch saal pehle jaish-e-mohammad ne apane kabje main le liya tha
 The camp consisted of former Pakistani Army officers and Afghan fighters who trained
 bataa den ki balakot centre kii duuri abtabad se mahaj 2-3 ghante kii he, abtabad vahi jagah he jahaan al kaayda kaa mukhiya osama bin laden america ke hamale main maaraa gaya tha
 The launch pads of the terrorists were evacuated in a week in view of the possibility of attack from India
 jabaki jaish ke top commander aamtaur par surakshit balakot camp main chale gaye the
 Hence, it is understandable that this time the information from the confidential sources was accurate and they had the feeling that the Jaish commanders removed from the Line of Control had reached the safe place Balakot
 lekin vayusena ke ek prahaar ne unke ghar main ghuskar unhen tabah kar diya

 The Supreme Court has rejected the petition filed against the central government's presentation of the budget on 1 February
 court ne kaha he ki centre kaa bajet kendriya hota he iskaa rajyon se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 You could not even tell which law or constitution it is a violation of

 In a two-page letter written to Akhilesh, the National Organization of Indian Police Service officials described the action against Durga as an autocratic and arbitrary manner and showed solidarity with the IAS officer

 The organization has requested the state government to immediately reinstate Durga

 The organization said that the organization expresses strong objection to the manner in which the basic rules of governance were ignored and the IAS officer was suspended on the lines of the principle of natural justice before taking action without giving an opportunity for clarification
 sanghathan ke sachiv pankaj kumaar singh ne patr main kaha, ‘anek sutron se pataa chalaa he ki vahaan koi sampradayik tanaav nahin tha yaa kanoon vyavastha ke halaat nahin bigade the jisaki vajah se durga shakti nagpal kaa nilamban kiya gaya he

 bhartiya cricket team ke purv captain saurav ganguli ne kaha ki agar simit overon kii team ke maujuuda captain mahendra singh dhoni 2019 vishwa cap main team kii aguai karte hai to unhen hairaani hogi
 Ganguly also said that the captaincy could be handed over to Virat Kohli soon
 ganguli ne kahaaki rashtriya chayankartaaon ko is mudde par faisla karnaa chahie jisase ki team bhavishya kii yojana bana sake
 Ganguly told India Today that Dhoni has been a captain for nine years, which is a long time
 usne jis tarah captain kii jimmedaari nibhaai vah kamaal thi lekin kya usamen kshamta he ki agle chaar saal main bharat ko 2019 main vishwa cap main le jaae
 Does it have the ability to last for four more years
 vah pehle hi test cricket chhod chukaa he or ab sirf ekadivasiy or tii20 maichon main kheltaa he
 He said that therefore the selectors would have to find answers as to whether Dhoni will lead in 2019
 agar jawaab nahin he to phir nayaa captain dhundie
 If the answer is yes, which i find quite surprising, then Dhoni should remain intact
 ganguli ne poocha, ‘‘duniya kii sabhi timen apane bhavishya kii yojana banaati hai, lekin chayankartaaon se meraa sawaal he ki teen se chaar saal baad kya ve emes dhoni ko bhartiya captain ke taur par dekhte hai
 Nanganguli, however, supported Dhoni to continue playing international cricket as India still needed him
 unhone kaha ki main yah nahin kah rahaa ki use cricket chhodane kii jarurat he
 i think he should continue playing in shorter formats
 bharat ko ab bhi simit overon kii cricket main uski jarurat he
 Ganguly also praised Kohli for his achievements as a Test captain
 viraat ko di jaae captaniganguli ne kaha ki viraat kohli har samay behatar ho rahaa he
 He is probably the best in the world in terms of consistency
 uski maansik urja bejod he
 His attitude on the field is excellent
 test captain ke rup main uskaa record shandaar he
 He said that the decision to appoint Kohli as captain will depend on where Dhoni goes from here
 uske sammaan main koi kami nahin ai he, vah desh ke mahanatam captainon main se ek he

 jo peedit hai vahi kyon pitate hai? kaali kamai or bhrashtachar par gurraai notebandi antat: unheen par kyon tut padi jo kaalikh or lut ke sabase bade shikaar hai
 Let's go to China for answers
 isi aktubar ke duusare saptaah main china kii communist party kii 19veen salanaa baithak main raashtrapati shi jinping ko ek anokhaa darja hasil hua
 The achievement was not that Xi was given a place in Mao Tse Tung and Deng Xiao's pantheon with a change in the Communist Party's constitution, but that Xi was the first leader in the world to win the fight against organized political and corporate corruption Pushed into the pantheon of the world's most powerful leaders
 beijing ke great haul of pipal main jab communist party shi kaa abhinandan kar rahi thi, tab tak unka bhrashtachar virdohi abhiyaan apni hi party ke 13 lakh padaadhikariyon va sarkari afasaron or 200 mantri str ke 'tigron’ ko sajaa de chukaa tha
 Xi gained strength and became popular by punishing corrupt leaders and veterans of his own party! In the shadow of the pain of unsuccessful demonetisation, China's campaign against corruption can provide many important sources
 ▪ is abhiyaan ke lakshya aam chini nahin balki netaa, sarkari mantri, sena or saarvajanik companiyon ke afasar the jo china ke kukhyat voan-joan (netaa-afasar-company gathjod) bhrashtachar kii vajah hai
 In 2013, Xi Jinping said that not only flies (small carcasses), lions (big leaders-officers) will also be trapped
 isane chini raajnneeti ke teen bade guton—‘petroleum gang’, ‘security gang’ or ‘shanksi gang’ (bade rajnatik netaaon kaa gut) par haath daalaa, jo ‘tigers’ kahe jate hai
 अभियान The Central Commission for Discipline Action (CCDI) is spearheading the campaign against corruption
 swatantra or adhikaar sampann agency ke jariye rajnatik va aarthik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jang kaa model duniya ke anya deshon, khaastaur par loktantron se mail khaataa hi he
 तरह Like any other country, this campaign of Xi was also disputed but much more transparent than China's expectations
 niyamit soochnaaon kaa pravaah or yahaan tak ki rajdooton ko bulaakar is swatchta mishan kii jaankaree dena is abhiyaan kaa hissaa tha
 सफलता The success of the campaign is reflected in Xi's political strength
 swatantra prekshak (khaastaur par taaja charchit kitaab chinaj kroni capitalism ke lekhak or california main clarmaant maccana college ke professor minaksin pe) maanate hai ki bade va sangathit bhrashtachar par nirnaayak prahaar se nichle str par bhrashtachar main kami mahasoos kii ja sakati he
 Although laws are weak in China and independent media is unavailable, mass campaigns are not an option
 ab waapas notebandi par1
 Demonetisation had to punish the veterans of soot but the jobs went to the common people, the business was closed to the younger ones
 bhrasht or kaale dhan ke rajnatik-aarthik thikaanon par koi fark nahin padaa
 2
 loktantr ke paimaanon par, notebandi ke faisle or nateezon main sarkaar apekshit paardarshee najar nahin ai
 3
 rajnatik makasad se chuninda jaanch ke alaava ucch padon par bhrashtachar par koi sangathit abhiyaan najar nahin aayaa
 Except China, no strong and independent investigative body could be formed in India like Pakistan
 panama (tex haiven) se rishton main pradhanmantri navaj sharif kaa naam aane ke baad, unke khilaaf adaalat va jaanch agency kii sakriyata dekhne laayak he
 In Panama Papers cases in India, a notice has not been sent even though the second batch of information on the tax haven's Indian relations (paradise Papers) has arrived

 Attorney General KK Venugopal on Monday lodged his protest in the Supreme Court against dismissing the case without hearing the lawyers
 venugopal ne yah virodh chif justise ranjan gogoi kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ke saamne darj karaayaa
 He said that citizens from far-flung areas of the country come to the apex court and the cji-led bench is dismissing their petitions without hearing them at the stage of accepting the petition for consideration

 ’ Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara said after the defeat of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the Cricket World Cup final that India's batting order is so strong that even a score of 300 runs is not enough to win

 Sangakkara admitted that the Sri Lankan team lost the opportunity despite initially dismissing Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar
 unhone kaha, ‘jab hamen pehle do wicket mil gayi the, uske baad ham acchhee gendbaaji nahin kar paye
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni settled at the crease
 ’sangakaara ne kaha, ‘puure match ke dauraan pich kaaphi acchhee thi

 "he said," When he scored 100 runs in the 18th or 19th over, we understood that he was making a good effort
 isi samay hamen un par thodaa dabaav bananaa chahie tha, lekin ham aisa nahin kar paye
 The inclusion of Sooraj Randiv in place of Anjata Mendis was not beneficial but the Sri Lankan captain said that he was included in the playing XI in view of Randiv's brilliant record against India
 sangakaara ne kaha, ‘ham mendis ke vikalp ke bare main soch rahe the
 We were forced to change the order due to Angelo Mathews
 randiv ne bharat ke khilaaf behtareen pradarshan kiya he
 Sri Lanka won the 1996 World Cup title

 The politics of Bihar revolved around regional satraps after the Congress's influence waned in Bihar, but after the Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (united) alliance collapsed last year, all major political parties started looking for new caste equations
 
 aise main bihar ke pramukh raajnneetik dalon ne chunaav main tikat bantwaare main bhi apane jaateey samikarnon kaa puraa khyaal rakhaa tha
 The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) gave tickets to 17 upper castes and won 14 in this election
 teen savarna ummidavaar jo haare ve nivartmaan saansad the
 Even though most of the upper caste candidates of the NDA won the elections, none of the upper caste candidates of Janata Dal (united) and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) could win
 jad (you) ne 10 tathaa rajd or congress gathbandhan ne aath savarna jati ke pratyaashee chunaav maidan main utaare the
 The Mai (muslim-yadav) equation of RJD also appeared to be difficult in this election
 kai aisi siten hai jahaan in donon jatiyon ke matadaata adhik hai lekin vahaan rajd ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Keeping this equation in mind, the RJD and Congress alliance had fielded 11 Yadav candidates from different regions, but only two Yadav candidates could wear the victory
 endie ne chaar yadav netaaon ko tikat diya tha
 All these won the election and made the RJD feel a dent in the yadav-muslim vote bank
 upie ne aath muslim pratyaashee maidan main utaare the, lekin katihaar, arriya or kishanganj se hi uske muslim pratyaashee jeet sake
 JDU, which split from BJP in the name of Narendra Modi, tried to attract Muslim voters
 isi ke tahat jediu ne 13 muslim ummidavaaron ko tikat dekar chunaav maidan main utaara, magar uskaa ek bhi muslim pratyaashee kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa
 It is believed that JDU strategists believed in Muslim votes but they have not been successful in this but on the other hand, the alliance of BJP with Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) seems to be a profitable deal
 
 endie ne sabhi surakshit siton par jeet kaa paracham laharaaya he
 While Gopalganj, Sasaram and Gaya came in favor of BJP, LJP candidates from Hajipur, Jamui, Samastipur have emerged victorious
 isi tarah endie se kushvaha jati ke do ummidavaar vijayi hue hai vahiin ati pichde jati ke bhi teen pratyaashee chunaav jite hai

 kingdom) ondec 5, 2016 at 1:24am PST The Crime Branch of Delhi Police has arrested a person named Virendra in the document leak case
 virendra raksha mantralay ke audit ofis main asthaayee karmchaaree he
 The arrest was in the case of the first FIR lodged by the Delhi Police
 police ke mutabik virendra ne petroleum mantralay ke karmchaaree laalataa prasad ko farji pahchaan patr kuch dastavej die jinka istemaal maamle ke duusare aaropee rajkumaar choube ne kiya mantralayon main aasaani se aane-jane main kiya
 However, according to the police, no sensitive documents of the Ministry of Defense have been leaked
 vahiin, duusari FIR main dilli police ne lokesh kii nishandehi par janakapuri ke ek kansalatency company main chapa maaraa jahaan lokesh chori kiye hue dastauez bechata tha
 In this case, seven to eight people of different ministries are being questioned
 corporate companiyon se giraftaar kiye 5 aropiyon ko aaj patiala house court main pesh kiya jayega
 If you want to talk to me, then define your words, Voltaire said this
 beete sattar varshon se ham dharm, secularism or aazaadee sareekhe shabdon par bahes karte aa rahe hai, vah bhi in shabdon ko paribhaashit kiye yaa hindustani sandarbh main inkaa asal matlab samajhe bagaiyr—secularism par kisi bhi vimarsh main in tathyon ko ki dharm religen nahin he or secularism kaa koi bhartiya paryaay nahin he, hamen buniyadi niyamon ke taur par sweekaar karnaa hoga
 The word Hindu cannot be combined with the Western concept of Religion which has originated quite recently
 duusari taraf bhartiya sandarbh main hindu shabd kai sahasrabdiyon purana he
 Hindu essentially meant a society with its own cultural and civilized way of life, its core beliefs, traditions and practices and prejudices
 bhartiya jivan paddati main dharm ahm bhoomika adaa karata he or yah hamaari rosemara kii jindagi kaa aadhaar he
 There are two examples of Hindu doctrines that symbolize the consequences of freedom of thought, expression, belief and 'tilijan'
 inaki sthapana aaj nahin balki 4,000 saal pehle anaam rishi-muniyon ne kii thi
 One of these is Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam or 'the whole earth is a family' and the other is Ekam Sadvipra often vadanti or 'universal reality is the same but different people call it by different names
 '' pracheen hindu bharat main kii gai in do ghoshnaaon main ham vaishvikaran or vichaar, vishwaas tathaa aasthaa kii aazaadee ke beej dekhte hai jo duniya ke aaj kaa vaishvik secular gaanv banane se 4,000 saal pehle boe gaye the
 In this way, the guarantee of the Constitution-provided freedom to follow any religion of its choice and the government's confidence in not interfering with it, which is called secularism in a gentle way, existed in India since ancient times and still continues
 cemetak yaa sami dharmon main aasthaa kii aazaadee ke buniyadi maanav adhikaar ke santhabaddh mandandon ke ulat hindustani vichaar prakriya main aasthaa, vishwaas or puja-upasna kii paddati ko rajyasatta ke daayre se baahar or bahari prabhaavon se saaf-suthra rakhaa gaya tha
 Nevertheless, the ability to socialize and inclusiveness made Hindutva with its roots in tradition, made it flexible, adaptable and dynamic towards modernity
 secularism kii avadharana bilkul alahada aitihaasik prakriyaaon main viksit hui thiah carch ke adhikaron or rajyasatta ke kartavyon ke bich talmail or pashchimi siyaasi itihaas main darshanik hastkshepon ke natijatan rajyasatta secular bani or use dharmik aazaadee dene kaa adhikaar hasil hua
 The question of keeping the state and religion separate also led to the framers of the Indian Constitution
 kya param adhikaron se sampann bhartiya rajyasatta siyaasi faislon ke hisse ke taur par maanav jivan ke harek pahalu ko, khaskar un naitik or dharmik muddon ko, prabhavit kar sakati he jinhen log apni nijee jindagi main ahm, abhinn or vishisht maanate hai?bhartiya samvidhan ke nirmaataaon ko na keval aazaadee ke andolan balki hindu bahul bhartiya samaaj ke saamaajik, saanskrithik, dharmik or rajnatik aadhaaron or unke silsilewar badlaavon ke itihaas or vikaas kii shaayad kahin zyada spasht samaj thi
 He envisaged a model of a secular political system that is egalitarian (sarva Dharma Sambhav) but protects all religions under the framework of a non-discriminatory social order, embodied by the principles of a welfare state matched by progressive increases in human dignity
 samvidhan sabha ne ise paribhaashit karne or bharat ko saaf or aadhikarik taur par 'sacular' ganraajya ghoshit karne ke mudde par bahes kii or aisa nahin karne kaa janaa-boojha faisla liya (constituent essembly dibates, wolum 7)
 The proposal of all amendments to add the words 'secular, Federal and Socialist' to the Preamble of the Constitution was made by veteran socialist leader and well-known Gujarati playwright
 tii
 Shah was brought
 unke aise tamaam prastaavon ko jinamein 'secular' shabd jodne kaa prastaav bhi tha, samvidhan sabha ne aakhirkaar khaarij kar diya tha
 His suggestion of adopting a coincidental presidential system of government was also rejected
 is baat par dhyaan dena jaruri he ki ye saare prastaav us prishthbhumi main khaarij kiye gaye the, jab dharm ke aadhaar par traasad vibhaajan ke baad charam hinsa kii ghatnaayen ho rahi thim or pakistan ne khud ko islamic ganraajya ghoshit kar diya tha
 In 1956 Pakistan became 'islamic Ganraj' Pakistan and declared Islam as the official religion
 aisa usne 1949 ke us uddeshy sankalp kaa paalan karte hue kiya, jisamen islam kii rajya dharm ke taur par aadhikarik bhoomika kii pariklpana kii gai thi
 While some people advocated the declaration of India as a secular state, there were others who advocated for a more comprehensive 'hindutva' to be included in the constitution and thus to recognize the rights of the majority community
 samvidhan sabha kii bahason se us madhyamargi hindu kii sachhee fitrat ujagar hoti he jo anivaary taur par secular he, is arth main ki vah sabhi aasthaaon, darshanon, vichaardhaaraon or puja-upasna kii paddatiyon ke prati sammaan kii bhaavana ko sweekaar karata he (sarv panth sambhaav)
 While religious leanings were rejected, adding the word 'secular' was also considered useless and useless in the Indian context
 dow
 Bhimrao Ambedkar argued that the bottom line of secularism has been enshrined in the provisions of fundamental rights and the declaration of freedom of thought, faith and expression in the Preamble
 'matbhedon kii sahishnutaa' kii jawaharlal nehru kii apil kaa jawaab dete hue acharya je
 B
 kriplani ne 'abhinanataaon kii sahishnutaa' or sahishnutaa ke (bilkul jahiraa taur par hindu) gandhivadi tareeke ke bich fark kiya tha
 He had said, "we have to respect each other's beliefs
" hamen is rup main iskaa sammaan karnaa hoga ki isamen satya kaa ansh he
 No religion is complete in the world, and yet there is no religion in which there is no part of the truth of God
 ''nehru or vamapanthiyon ke 'gaiyr dharmik rajyasatta' ke vichaaron ke khilaaf jate hue siyaasi pratishthan ne saajha dastur ke aage sir jhukaaya or sarv-dharm prarthanaaon ke gandhivadi pratikwaad ko or kisi bhi yaa sabhi dharmon ko tyaage bagaiyr unke saath samaan duuri ko apanaaya
 In fact, as far as secularism is concerned, Ambedkar describes imitation of the West as futile
 unhone religen-raajnneeti ke bich kii kadi ko behatar rekhaankit kiya or is baat par jor diya ki hindustan main siyaasi krantiyaan or badlaav tamaam duusari jagahon kii tarah hameshaa dharmik saanche main viksit saamaajik jaagrukta ke baad hue hai
 The religious reforms of Martin Luther, puritanism in colonial North America, the religious and social movement of Gautama Buddha, the religious and social reforms of the saints of Maharashtra before Shivaji's reign or the social and religious power behind the Sikh Empire — these are just a few examples, Which they cite to further confirm that the liberation of mind and soul before the political expansion of the people Ruri is (biadblyues, Vol
 1e anihilation of cast, pej 43-44)
 The historical development of the concept of secularism and the main principle of which the Church and the State were kept completely separate in Europe is as alien and unambiguous to Hindustan as between joint culture, tolerance and state and religion
 The entire relationship is a breakdown
 hindu jeevancharyabharatiya parivesh main naastikta or nirishwarwad sahit puja-upasna ke harek rup ko satya kii athak khoj mana jaataa he
 This is not the case in the West and Europe, where ancient beliefs were denounced as paganism, their literature destroyed, and atheism completely banned
 puja-upasna kii vividhta ke liye pahachaane jane vaale bahuishwaravaadi samaajon ko bedakhal karke akeshwarwadi samrajyavaadee vyavasthaaen sthapit kii gayi, jinhone raja yaa carch ke dharm ke prati sampurna or asandigdh nishtha or ek dharmagranth, ek ishwar, ek carch ko sweekaar karne kii maang purajor tareeke se kii
 The Church's religious dictatorship kept the democratic states alive for centuries until enlightened reforms and scientific temper emerged under democracies
 aadhuniktaa or vigyaan par sawaal uthaanaa or roodhiwaad tathaa saanskrithik barbarta ko jaij tehraana akeshwarwadi sami dharmon kii khaasiyat rahi he
 The continuously continuing civilization that embraces all of India and the strong cultural underpinnings that provide fertilizer and water to its roots have been able to survive for centuries without a unifying political power, only because of their secular political systems
 hindustan ke hajaaron barason ke itihaas main ek bhi dharmatantric rajyasatta nahin hui
 Nehru, the country's first Prime Minister, rejected the inclusion of secularism in the Constitution and ironically, two decades later, his daughter Indira Gandhi not only gave unprecedented authority to the Prime Minister and Parliament through the 42nd Amendment and a 20-page-long detailed document
 Instead, he made extensive changes in almost every part of the constitution including the Preamble and the 'sovereign, democratic republic' Nprbhu, socialist, secular, replaced in the Democratic Republic '
 kya hindustan 1947 se 1976 tak koi kam secular tha, yaa ab ham vaaki zyada secular hai kyonki samvidhan aisa kahata he? desh kaa secularism sadiyon se rajyaniti kaa abhinn ang rahaa he
 Constitutional guarantees to minorities have actually become a tool in the hands of political parties, on the basis of which they carry out deep polarization on religious grounds and build vote banks
 bheeshan garibi, avasaron or aadhunik shiksha kii kami, jo kai baar samudaay khud hi apane upar thope lete hai, berogari or chuni hui sarkaron kaa pakshpaati ravaiya alpsankhyakon ke man main 'bahusnkhyakon ke dabadabe' ke dar ko or badha dete hai
 The current debate about the segregation of minorities, apart from being a low-level deviation, seems to be very politically motivated on the one hand, and on the other hand it has been further spoiled by the mistakes of the political class

 When it comes to passing judgment on matters related to religion, then justice becomes a challenge and the greater the diversity of religion, the greater the challenge
 badakismati se aarthik or duusare secular vishyon ke ulat dharm ko ek vaidhanik niamkeey nikaay ke maatahat nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 The work of reviving and rejuvenating the faith-based affiliations, which is called religion, has to come from within the community concerned

 narendra modi kii aguwai vaali bijepi ke vijay rath ko thaamna rahul gandhi ke liye aasaan nahin hone ja rahaa he
 There is only a little more than 1 year left in the battle for the 2019 general elections, but political bets are being prepared keeping this in mind
 bijepi apane tir-tarkash ko durust kar rahi he, to rahul gandhi apane daanv pench aajamaa rahe hai
 In such a situation, to understand the mood of the country (mood of the nation), but in the survey conducted by Aaj Tak (if elections are held today), the NDA is getting an edge
 survey ke mutabik 2019 main ek baar phir narendra modi kii aguwai main endie kii sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 The NDA is seen getting 309 seats in the survey, while the UPA figure is barely surpassing 100
 modi ke vijay rath ko tham sakate hai rahul!haalanki survey main rahul ke liye ummid kii ek kiran dikhaai detii he
 And that if Rahul manages to create opposition unity, then the NDA under Modi will stay away from the magic figure
 survey ke mutabik agar aaj loksabhaa chunaav hote hai, to endie ko 40 fisadi, upie ko 38 fisadi or anya ko 22 fisadi vot milenge
 However, in a survey conducted earlier, the NDA was said to get 42 per cent of the votes, which means that the popularity of NDA has declined by two per cent in this survey
 sapa-basapa-trinmul se majboot banegi upasarve ko dhyaan main dekhen to yah samaj aata he ki agar rahul gandhi ne vipaksh yani tiemasi, bispi or sapa ko saadh liya, to upie ke khate main 38 fisadi vot aa jaaenge
 That is, the difference of vote between NDA and UPA will be two percent
 isi tarah agar congress ke saath tiemasi, bispi or sapa aa jaaen, to upi ke khate main 202 siten aa sakati hai, jabaki endie ke khate main mahaj 258 siten or anya ke khate main 83 siten aaengi
 Even with 258 seats, the NDA will remain magical
 bataa den ki 543 siton vaali loksabhaa main bahumat ke liye jaadui aankada 272 kaa he
 a tremendous boom in Rahul's popularity After the Gujarat elections, Congress President Rahul Gandhi's popularity has increased tremendously
 is dauraan narendra modi or rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata kaa antar 24 fisadi kam hua he
 The survey also revealed that even today, Indira Gandhi is the most popular leader in South India and Muslim dominated areas
 hitech city gudgaanv kii hiprophile socity main 2 baje raat ko ek flats main teen goliyaan chalati he or do laashen girti hai
 One body of a woman and another body of a man
 lekin raat ke sannaate main flats main goliyaan kyon chalin ye kisi kii samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha
 Who fired the first shot of the two people who died, that is, the police now have to find out who the killer is? At midnight, the entire city was in a state of sleep, but the second floor of Flat No
 17 c of RD City, Sector 52, Gurgaon
 i had something going on
 yahaan maujuud do logon kii ankhon se neend koson dur thi
 Two shadows were walking in the house with great restlessness and silence
 17 si kii chat ke neeche raat ko ek mahila or ek mard maujuud hai
 Both the shadows are in a struggle
 isi bich ek saae ke haath main pistaul dikhaai detii he
 This shadow starts walking around with a pistol in hand and then there is a fire in the lobby of the house
 kuch hi second ke baad ek duusari goli chalati he or chand second baad teesri goli kii awaz ke saath hi flats main ek khamoshi si chaa jaati he
 After this fire, two people collapses in the lobby of the flat
 in do logon main se ek mahila he or doosraa purush
 The door of the house is locked from inside and there are two dead bodies in the house
 ye laashen kiski hai ye philhal koi nahin jaanata
 Now the question is, who were these two people present in the flat of Highprofile Society of Gurgaon? Why was there a shootout at two o'clock in the night? Who fired at Who is the dying woman? Who is the person to die? What is the secret of two deaths in flat number 17C? What is the truth of two dead bodies of midnight
 raat ke andhere main do-do maut kii ye wo uljhi paheli he jise sulajhane main police ke bhi paseene chhot rahe hai
 From the morning of the 11th, the officers of the special cell were calling on the mobile of their fast-tracked inspector Badrish Dutt, but even after the passing of hours, the police officers started worrying about Dutt when Badrish's phone did not pick up
 police afasaro kii bechaini is kadar badi ki unhone us flats kaa rukh kiya jahaan badrish dutt aksar raat main rukaa karte the
 The maid of this house has been continuously ringing the house bell since 11 am but no one was opening the door from inside the house
 ghar main bilkul khamoshi si chai thi
 Right now the maid was waiting for the door to open that some police officers reach the flat and ring the doorbell
 kaaphi der tak darwaja naa khulata dekh police ke afasar darwaja tod dete hai
 As soon as the main door of the house is broken, these officers enter the lobby of the house and as soon as a few steps in the lobby go ahead, the ground of the police officers also slips under the feet
 ji haa ghar kii lobby main ek mahila kii khun se lathpath laash padi thi
 a pistol was lying with the woman's body
 mahila kii laash ke bilkul najadik ek shaks kii laash padi thi
 This corpse was not of anyone else but of Inspector Badrish Dutt posted in the Special Cell of Delhi Police
 donon ke sir main goli lagi thi wo bhi aarpaar ho chuki thi
 When the police identified the woman's body, it was found that the body was of a woman named Geeta Sharma
 jo gudgaanv main hi ek privet detective agency chalaaya karti thi
 The flat in which the police found these two dead bodies also belongs to Geeta Sharma, Geeta was living in this house for the last 9 years
 ghar main do mauton kaa ye maamla bada tha lihaaja dilli or gudgaanv ke bade afasaron kaa mauka-e-vaardaat par aana janaa shuru ho gaya
 In the initial investigation, the police felt that since the pistol was on the right side of the woman's hand, it seems that the woman first shot the inspector and then shot himself in the head and committed suicide
 lekin ye mahaj ek kayaas tha isliye mauka-e-vaardaat par aakhir kya hua, kisne kise goli maari ye jaanane ke liye jile kii forensik team ko bhi bula liya gaya
 Actually the Inspector Badrish's body was found in the flat
 unki ginati dilli police kii special cell main dabang afasaron main hoti thi
 Badrish served to destroy the modules from Parliament attack to Batla House and all terrestrials
 lekin police kii samaj main ye nahin aa rahaa tha ki badrish is flats main kya kar rahe the
 While his family lives in Faridabad and they are already married
 ab sawaal ye tha ki aakhir dilli police kaa inspector gudgaanv main ek mahila ke flats main kya kar rahaa tha
 What was Badrish's relationship with Geeta Sharma, and the biggest question was why the bullet finally came in at two o'clock in the night
 in sawaalon main sabase penchida sawaal ye ki aakhir kisne, kisko goli maari
 Which means who is committing suicide by killing both of them
 gita sharma ne inspector badrish kaa katl kiya or phir khudakushi kar lee yaa phir inspector ne gita kaa katl karne ke baad khud ko goli maar lee
 a Delhi Police Supercop, a beautiful Gurgaon spy and a flat
 is flats main donon kii laash
 This is the mystery of the flat number 17C of Gurgaon, which has shed the sweat of the police
 ji haa police ke saamne do ahm sawaal hai pehla ye ki pehali goli kisne chalaai or doosraa sawaal ye ki goli kyon chalaai gai
 These are the smoldering questions to which the Gurgaon Police itself is searching 24 hours after the incident
 inspector badrish kii laash jameen par padi thi or unase bilkul satee hui gita sharma kii laash thi
 On the right hand side of Geeta, Badrish had a service bore Glock pistol
 jabaki goli donon ke sir main lagi thi
 The bullet in Geeta's head was hit from the right side while the bullet was seen from the left side in Badrish's head
 shuruaati jaanch main forensik export ko itnaa to saaf ho jaataa he ki donon rhite hander the lihaaja badrish sidhe haath se baayin canapati par goli nahin maar sakate
 Whereas Geeta can easily shoot the bullet on his right forearm with the right hand
 yani yun laga ki gita ne pehle inspector badrish ko goli maari or fouran baad hi khud kii canapati se pistaul sataakar khudakushi kar lee
 Seeing both the dead bodies, it was assumed that Geeta first fired and then committed suicide
 lekin hairaani kii baat ye he ki vaardaat ke 24 ghante baad hi gudgaanv police kii ye theory bhi us vakt fail ho gai
 When the post-mortem doctor made an important disclosure
 ji haa khulaasa ye ki inspector badrish ko goli dahini canapati par lagi or bain taraf se baahar nikal gai
 While in Geeta's head, the bullet hit the upper part
 yani pehali goli gita ne nahin balki inspector badrish ne chalaai or phir khudakushi kar lee
 Now, this mystery of two deaths in Gurgaon seems even more complicated after this doctor's statement
 sawaal ab bhi vahi bana hua he ki aakhir goli pehle kisne chalaai or raat ke do baje hui is firing ke peeche kii asli vajah kya he?inspector badrish shaadishuda the, iske baavjood wo liv-in rilshan main gita sharma ke saath rahaa karte the
 Badrish's wife says that her husband was soon to return home
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki kya badrish kii ghar vaapasi kaa faisla hi do mauton kii vajah ban gaya? yaa phir gita sharma kii jasusi duniya se do mauton kaa rishta judaa he
 After the death of Tej Tarra Police Officer Badrish of 1991 batch, many questions are being raised
 sawaal ye ki badrish kaa gita sharma se rishta kya tha
 Actually Badrish was married in 1999 with Ruchi
 donon ki jidangi hansi-khushi guzar rahi thi
 Meanwhile, Geeta Sharma stepped into Badrish's life and Badrish came very close to Geeta
 detective agency chalaane vaali gita bhi talakshuda thi
 Over time Badrish's closeness with Geeta grew so much that both of them started living together in the same plot
 police kii maane gita sharma ke upar kai frod ke cese chal rahe hai isi saal farji tareeke se emechae ke steekar kaa istemaal karne ke iljaam main gita ko 21 din kii jail bhi kaatani padi thi
 Geeta also wrote in her diary that Badrish did not go to jail to meet her
 jail se jamaanat par reeha hone ke baad hi badrish or gita main jhagade shuru ho gaye the
 According to the wife of Inspector Badrish, she was aware of her husband's relationship with Geeta, but despite this she did not want to get divorced
 darasal bivi se alag hone ke baad se hi badrish gita ke saath hi rahaa karte the or ab police bhi ye hi maanakar chal rahi he ki gita kaa criminal record or paariwarik kalah hi in do mauton kii asli vajah he

 Senior advocate Sushil Kumar, appearing for Raja, told Special CBI Judge Justice OP Saini that the agency should record Chidambaram's statement in the context of a cabinet meeting in which he clarified the position on the issue of dilution of shares
 raja ke vakil ne kaha ki chidambaram se yah poocha janaa chahie ki kya unhone pradhanmantri kii maujuudagi main sheyaron ko kam karne ke mudde par suzav diya tha
 He said, 'chidambaram should be summoned to the court and asked whether the meeting was held in the presence of the Prime Minister or not, and whether you (chidambaram) suggested it or not

 raja ke vakil ne kaha ki adaalat ko aapraadh dand samhita kii dhara 311 ke tahat apni shakti kaa istemaal karnaa chahie or chidambaram se gavaah ke taur par poochtacha kerani chahie
 He said, 'in that meeting, the then Finance Minister had clarified the situation on the issue of dilution of shares

 The CBI should record his statement as soon as possible
 ’bachaav paksh ke vakil ne kaha, ‘chidambaram ko siarpisi kii dhara 311 ke tahat bulaayaa jaae or unase poocha jaae ki kya yah baithak hui thi
 He said that the CBI case is based on two things in which one states that Raja auctioned the spectrum and secondly he favored two companies by reducing shares

 lekin andaja lagaaya ja rahaa he ki ponti chaddha ke thikaanon par chhapemari se kareeb 300 karod baraamad ho sakate hai

 SON- SONA (@sonamohapatra) May 26, 2019 This is not the first time Sona Mahapatra has made his pointless statement
 sona mohpatra apane bold or bindaas bayanon ke liye jaani jaati hai
 He also accused singer Kailash Kher of meetoo
 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii ore se jari kaa gai ummidavaaron kii list main laalkrishna adwani kaa tikat kaat diya gaya he
 Now after this, if someone is blaming age for cutting Advani's ticket, then someone is presenting an explanation for it
 kendriya mantri uma bharti kaa kahana he ki adwani ji kaa tikat nahin kataa he, is baar unhone bhi chunaav na ladane kaa man bana liya he
 Uma Bharti said that the reason for this is that Advani has not contested elections many times before
 unhone kaha ki adwani ji ko ham bhula hi nahin sakate, 1984 main 2 siton se bijepi aaj yahaan tak pahunchi he to adwani ji ke hi kaaran hi yah mumkin hua he
 Uma Bharti said that Advani ji led the Ayodhya movement, Advani ji took out the rath yatra, today Modi is the Prime Minister because of Advani ji
 unka sirf yogadan hi nahin he, unka hona hi party ke liye badi baat he
 Today this existence of BJP is also due to them
 kendriya mantri uma bharti ne kaha ki yah baat goa se shuru hui, jab narendra modi ko prachaar samiti kii kaman saunpane kii baat hui thi or rajnath singh party adhyaksh bane the or us vakt bhi adwani goa nahin gaye the
 This led to discussions and was made Modi versus Advani
 uma bharti ne kaha ki wo baat aaj tak khatm nahin hui or us baat ko khatm karne kaa ek hi tarika he
 i appeal to Advani ji, he openly bless Modiji and deny these things
 bado ne chhoton ko sammaan ke saath aage badhaayaa he, is parampara ko adwaniji bhi jaanate hai
 On the announcement that she would not contest the elections herself, Uma Bharti said that because of Ganga, i want to visit the Ganges, so i will not contest
 unhone kaha ki main pehle hi kah chuki hum, jhaansi se to pehle se zyada voton se jitungi
 Uma Bharti claimed that she received proposals from the party to contest elections in Khujraho, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and many other places but did not contest
 unka kahana he ki wo loksabhaa chunaav prachaar main bhaag lengi or sanghathan main rah kar raajnneeti karengi
 On Amit Shah contesting from Gandhinagar, Uma Bharti said that Amit Shah is contesting from Gandhinagar
 wo iskaa swaagat karti hai
 He believes that this will balance, the same person as Advani is contesting from Gandhinagar, Amit Shah is maintaining the same political legacy that Advani used to do
 pradhanmantri modi par uma bharti ne kaha ki modi to unic he, wo apane aap main sampurna hai, vah akele hi hai, isliye jodi kii baat nahin karti hum
 On the issue of not giving tickets to leaders above 75 years of age, Uma Bharti said that multinational companies only keep retired people and employ them
 uma bharti ne kaha ki sona jitna purana hoga uski keemat utani hi badhati he
 She says that she does not believe this, but if the party says such a thing then it is wrong
 uma bharti kaa maananaa he ki adwani unase zyada feet hai
 Uma Bharti took a dig at Priyanka Gandhi and said that she came out when her husband is under the charge of very big charges and Priyanka has come out to save her husband
 uttar pradesh main maaya or akhilesh kii jodi par uma bharti ne kaha ki sapa or basapa ke kaaryakarta ek-duusare ko pasand nahin karte hai
 Due to the confrontation between Mayawati and Mulayam Singh, where SP candidates will be there, the people of BSP will vote for BJP and where there will be BSP candidates, the people of SP will vote for BJP
 uma bharti kaa daawa he ki gathbandhan ke hone se bijepi ko phayda milegaa or congress kii to hawa pehle hi nikal chuki he

 The vulgar language being used in a section of social media regarding the movement of students of Banaras Hindu University is more serious than the controversy about their movement
 yah bataata he ki soshal media ke raajnneetik istemaal ne kisi bhi masale ko lekar saarvajanik spes main bahes karne kii sari shalinitaon ko samaapt kar diya he
 Tampering is a national problem
 iskaa saamana hamaari ladkiyaan banaras hindu uniwarsity hi nahin, bharat main kahin bhi karti hai
 When she opposes this, the answer should be about the incident, not who came later in their movement, how the slogans were raised
 sawaal yahi he ki kya biechayu ke bheetar 21 sitambar kii shaam ko chaatra ke saath chhedhkhani hui thi, hui thi to usee vakt uniwarsity prashasan ne kya kadam uthaae? hamane exiaar, chaatraon se baatcheet ke aadhaar par ghatana kaa kram taiyaar kiya he
 The victim was on a bicycle at the time and was wearing a salwar suit
 achaanak do bike savaar uske paas aae or apana haath suut ke andar daal diya
 In front of Bharat Kala Bhavan, the spot was less illuminated, so she could not see the number of the bike in more panic
 das meter kii duuri par guard khadey the magar chillane ke baad bhi koi nahin aayaa
 The boys were standing at some distance from there and they ran towards the girl for help
 jab peedita guard ke paas shikaayat karne ke liye pahunchi to guard ne kaha ki shaam chah baje ke baad ghumogi to yahi hoga
 There should be an investigation whether the guard really did it
 guard ne pukaarane par kya kiya
 By the way the guard has been removed
 phone karne ke baad proctorial board ke sadsy haazir ho gaye
 They were told to call the guard and ask why did not help, then the answer was that they had left
 proctorial board ke adhikariyon ne kaha ki likhit shikaayat dijie, karrwai hogi
 Students kept asking them what action would be taken, you tell it first
 sisitivi kaa footage maanga gaya to kaha gaya ki agle din technician lekar aaiyegaa, footage denge
 We do not have a technician
 kya biechayu ke paas sisitivi kaa footage check karne or nikaal kar dene ke liye technician nahin he? ladkiyaan vahaan se chali gayi, ladke proctorial board ke adhikariyon se baat karte rahe
 The girl went to the warden, the warden said that the bus was touched and what did it do
 ab isaki bhi jaanch honi chahie ki kya warden ne aisa bolaa? gyaarah se baarah baje ke bich proctorial board ke adhikari or chaatro ke bich baatcheet chalati rahi
 When the student came to register an FIR around eleven o'clock, the name and address were asked, and did not want to give the fear of being exposed
 isliye exiaar nahin hui
 The next day morning when the students of Triveni Hostel reached bhu's gate in a peaceful march
 jaise hi baaki girls hostal ko pataa chalaa, bahut si ladkiyaan aa gayi
 The FIR was registered on 22 September at 1
45 AM
 exiaar main ghatana kaa samay shaam chah baj kar 20 minute he
 Is there a one-day incident or molestation within BHU? ladakiyon kaa pradarshan bilkul swat: sfoort tha
 Later other student organizations and people came in his support
 isse uniwarsity ko yah kehane kaa bahaanaa mil gaya ki andolan main unke chaatr nahin hai, bahari hai, yah andolan raajnneetik ho gaya he
 The administration has got an excuse but whether politics is happening only on this basis the question of molestation and lathi charge can be avoided
 kya koi bhi abhibhavak chahega ki unki bacchee ek aisi uniwarsity main jaae jahaan chhedhkhani aam baat ho
 The question is why the university administration did not stand with the girl students
 21 sitambar kii shaam saadhe chah baje ke kareeb chhedhkhani kii ghatana hoti he, usee din dopaher teen baje ke kareeb naveen chatravaas kii chaatraon ne chhedhkhani kii shikaayat proctor or dean ko saunpi thi
 The students have written in the memorandum that teasing is on the way
 antarrashtriya chaatraon ko bhi chhedhkhani kaa saamana karnaa padataa he jo sabake liye sharmnaak he
 The boys masturbate outside the hostel, throw stones and use offensive words
 prashasan ne karrwai kaa bharosa bhi jataayaa tha
 The comments kya visi ko lathi charge kii jaankaree thi, kiske aadesh se campus main lathi charge hua
 Who gave the police permission to enter the girls hostel, why did the girls lathi? The video footage shows the police besieging the girl, the students running away
 vaais chancelar kehete hai ki campus main petrol bam chal rahaa tha
 Has BHU become the condition that petrol bombs go on there
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath se kaha he ki ve is masale par gaur karen or tatkaal samaadhaan nikaalen
 CM Adityanath has sought a report from the IG police
 1000 agyaat chaatro par mukadmaa darj hua he
 Two policemen have been introduced to the line, ie removed from duty
 peedita us vakt cycle par thi or salwar suut pahan rakhaa tha
 Suddenly two bike riders came to him and put his hand inside the suit
 ghatana sthal yani bharat kala bhawan ke saamne raushnee kam thi isliye bhi or ghabrahat main vah bike kaa number nahin dekh saki
 Guards were standing at a distance of ten meters but no one came even after shouting
 vahaan se kuch duuri par ladke khadey the wo ladki kii taraf madad ke liye daude
 When the victim reached the guard to complain, the guard said that if she turns around after six in the evening
 jaanch honi chahie ki kya guard ne vaaki aisa kiya
 What did the guard do when he called
 vaise guard ko hataa diya gaya he
 After calling, the members of the Proctorial Board attended
 unase kaha gaya ki guard ko bulaakar puuchhie ki kyon nahin madad kii to jawaab mila ki chuttee ho chuki he ve ja chuke hai
 Proctorial board officials said that give written complaint, action will be taken
 unase chaatr poochhate rahe ki kya karrwai hogi, aap pehle ye bataaiye
 When asked for CCTV footage, it was said that the next day technicians would come and give the footage
 hamaare paas technician nahin he
 Does BHU not have a technician to check and remove CCTV footage? The girls left from there, the boys kept talking to the officials of the Proctorial Board
 ladki warden ke paas gai, warden ne bolaa ki bas chuaa hi to tha or kya kiya
 Now it should also be investigated whether the warden said so? Conversations between the Proctorial Board officer and the students continued from eleven to twelve o'clock
 saadhe gyaarah baje ke kareeb exiaar darj karaane chaatr pahunche to naam or pataa poocha gaya to ujagar hone ke bhay se dena nahin chahta he
 Hence no FIR was registered
 agle din subah jab triveni hostal kii chatraayen shantipurna march karti hui biechayu ke get par pahunch gayi
 As soon as the rest of the girls hostel came to know, many girls arrived
 exiaar 22 sitambar ko ek baj kar das minute par darj hui
 The time of the incident in the FIR is 6:30 in the evening
 kya biechayu ke bheetar ek din kii ghatana he yaa chhedhkhani aam baat ho chuki he
 The girls' performance was absolutely spontaneous
 baad main duusare chaatr sanghathan or log unke samarthan main aa gaye
 This gave the university an excuse to say that they do not have students in the movement, they are outsiders, this movement has become political
 prashasan ko bahaanaa to mil gaya lekin kya raajnneeti ho rahi he sirf isi aadhaar par chhedhkhani se lekar lathi charge ke sawaal se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Would any parent want their child to go to a university where molestation is common
 sawaal he ki uniwarsity prashasan chaatraon ke saath kyon nahin khadaa hua
 The incident of molestation occurs around 6:30 pm on September 21, the same day, around 3 pm, the students of the new hostel had reported the complaint of molestation to the Procter and Dean
 chaatraon ne memorondom main likhaa he ki aae din raste main chhedhkhani hoti he
 International students also have to face flirting which is shameful for everyone
 ladke chatravaas ke baahar hastmaithun karte hai, pathar phenkate hai or aapatti janak shabdon kaa istamaal karte hai
 The administration also expressed confidence in the action
 tippaniyan Was the VC aware of the lathi charge, whose order led to the lathi charge on campus
 police ko girls hostal main ghusane kii anumati kisne di, chaatraon par laathiyaan kyon baraseen? video footage he ki police ladki ko gher kar maar rahi he, chaatr bhaag rahe hai
 The Vice Chancellor says that a petrol bomb was going on in the campus
 kya biechayu kii ye haalat ho gai he ki vahaan petrol bam chalate hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to look into this issue and find an immediate solution
 siem adityanath ne aiji police se report maangi he
 a case has been filed against 1000 unknown students
 do pulicekarmiyon ko line haazir kiya gaya he yani duty se hataaya gaya he
 There should be an investigation whether the guard really did it
 guard ne pukaarane par kya kiya
 By the way the guard has been removed
 phone karne ke baad proctorial board ke sadsy haazir ho gaye
 They were told to call the guard and ask why did not help, then the answer was that they had left
 proctorial board ke adhikariyon ne kaha ki likhit shikaayat dijie, karrwai hogi
 Students kept asking them what action would be taken, you tell it first
 sisitivi kaa footage maanga gaya to kaha gaya ki agle din technician lekar aaiyegaa, footage denge
 We do not have a technician
 kya biechayu ke paas sisitivi kaa footage check karne or nikaal kar dene ke liye technician nahin he? ladkiyaan vahaan se chali gayi, ladke proctorial board ke adhikariyon se baat karte rahe
 The girl went to the warden, the warden said that the bus was touched and what did it do
 ab isaki bhi jaanch honi chahie ki kya warden ne aisa bolaa? gyaarah se baarah baje ke bich proctorial board ke adhikari or chaatro ke bich baatcheet chalati rahi
 When the student came to register an FIR around eleven o'clock, the name and address were asked, and did not want to give the fear of being exposed
 isliye exiaar nahin hui
 The next day morning when the students of Triveni Hostel reached bhu's gate in a peaceful march
 jaise hi baaki girls hostal ko pataa chalaa, bahut si ladkiyaan aa gayi
 The FIR was registered on 22 September at 1
45 AM
 exiaar main ghatana kaa samay shaam chah baj kar 20 minute he
 Is there a one-day incident or molestation within BHU? ladakiyon kaa pradarshan bilkul swat: sfoort tha
 Later other student organizations and people came in his support
 isse uniwarsity ko yah kehane kaa bahaanaa mil gaya ki andolan main unke chaatr nahin hai, bahari hai, yah andolan raajnneetik ho gaya he
 The administration has got an excuse but whether politics is happening only on this basis the question of molestation and lathi charge can be avoided
 kya koi bhi abhibhavak chahega ki unki bacchee ek aisi uniwarsity main jaae jahaan chhedhkhani aam baat ho
 The question is why the university administration did not stand with the girl students
 21 sitambar kii shaam saadhe chah baje ke kareeb chhedhkhani kii ghatana hoti he, usee din dopaher teen baje ke kareeb naveen chatravaas kii chaatraon ne chhedhkhani kii shikaayat proctor or dean ko saunpi thi
 The students have written in the memorandum that teasing is on the way
 antarrashtriya chaatraon ko bhi chhedhkhani kaa saamana karnaa padataa he jo sabake liye sharmnaak he
 The boys masturbate outside the hostel, throw stones and use offensive words
 prashasan ne karrwai kaa bharosa bhi jataayaa tha
 The comments kya visi ko lathi charge kii jaankaree thi, kiske aadesh se campus main lathi charge hua
 Who gave the police permission to enter the girls hostel, why did the girls lathi? The video footage shows the police besieging the girl, the students running away
 vaais chancelar kehete hai ki campus main petrol bam chal rahaa tha
 Has BHU become the condition that petrol bombs go on there
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath se kaha he ki ve is masale par gaur karen or tatkaal samaadhaan nikaalen
 CM Adityanath has sought a report from the IG police
 1000 agyaat chaatro par mukadmaa darj hua he
 Two policemen have been introduced to the line, ie removed from duty
 exiaar 22 sitambar ko ek baj kar das minute par darj hui
 The time of the incident in the FIR is 6:30 in the evening
 kya biechayu ke bheetar ek din kii ghatana he yaa chhedhkhani aam baat ho chuki he
 The girls' performance was absolutely spontaneous
 baad main duusare chaatr sanghathan or log unke samarthan main aa gaye
 This gave the university an excuse to say that they do not have students in the movement, they are outsiders, this movement has become political
 prashasan ko bahaanaa to mil gaya lekin kya raajnneeti ho rahi he sirf isi aadhaar par chhedhkhani se lekar lathi charge ke sawaal se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Would any parent want their child to go to a university where molestation is common
 sawaal he ki uniwarsity prashasan chaatraon ke saath kyon nahin khadaa hua
 The incident of molestation occurs around 6:30 pm on September 21, the same day, around 3 pm, the students of the new hostel had reported the complaint of molestation to the Procter and Dean
 chaatraon ne memorondom main likhaa he ki aae din raste main chhedhkhani hoti he
 International students also have to face flirting which is shameful for everyone
 ladke chatravaas ke baahar hastmaithun karte hai, pathar phenkate hai or aapatti janak shabdon kaa istamaal karte hai
 The administration also expressed confidence in the action
 tippaniyan Was the VC aware of the lathi charge, whose order led to the lathi charge on campus
 police ko girls hostal main ghusane kii anumati kisne di, chaatraon par laathiyaan kyon baraseen? video footage he ki police ladki ko gher kar maar rahi he, chaatr bhaag rahe hai
 The Vice Chancellor says that a petrol bomb was going on in the campus
 kya biechayu kii ye haalat ho gai he ki vahaan petrol bam chalate hai

 Once a stronghold of the Congress, the Congress has fielded poet Imran Pratapgarhi this time in Moradabad seat of Uttar Pradesh
 yah seat pehle robert wadra ke siyaasi aagaaj kii atakalon ko lekar surkhiyon main thi, baad main raaj babbar ne bhi is seat se chunaav ladane se manaa kar diya tha

 BJP wants to spread hatred between Hindus and Muslims
 When Congress candidate Imran was asked whether the issue of nationalism is effective or local issues in Moradabad
 jawaab tha ki yahaan donon mudde prabhavi hai, lekin rashtrawaad kaa mudda pramukh he

 The bodies of 17 Himalayan vultures were found five days ago near Nadehi village in Udham Singh Nagar district in Uttarakhand and four were found to be in critical condition
 van vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke anusaar, shavon ke paas hi ek bhens kaa shav bhi paaya gaya tha
 On this basis, forest workers claimed that the vultures may have eaten the carcass of the buffalo and that the oxytocin injection used to increase the amount of buffalo milk may have spread poison to the buffalo's body
 gauratlab he ki oxitosin injection centre sarkaar dwaara pratibandhit kiya ja chukaa he
 Paramjit Singh, the Chief Conservator of Forests (kumaon), has confirmed the death of vultures due to poisoning
 vanadhikariyon ke is daawey ke vipareet nainital sthit pashu chikitsa adhikari dow
 Yogesh Bhardwaj refuted the claim that prima facie it seems that the vultures died not from eating the carcass of a buffalo, but because of poisoning
 unhone kaha ki yah avashya ho saktaa he ki gidhon ko maarane ke liye bhens ke shav par koi jaharila padaarth daalaa gaya ho
 He said there are other side effects of oxytocin injection, but it is not possible for vultures to die by eating buffalo carcasses

 The Chief Conservator of Forests (kumaon) said that the vulture research institute at Pijnor in Haryana, the bird research center at Pantnagar in Uttarakhand and the Indian Veterinary Science Research Center at Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh have sent 17 vultures for examination
 nadehi sthit ghatnasthal par gidhon ke 17 shav baraamad kiye gaye the, jabaki chaar giddh gambhir rup se biimaar paae gaye the

 Doctors have still not received orders for postmortem of the bodies of the four vultures killed during treatment, while four days earlier the doctors had also informed the forest officials about the death of the remaining four vultures

 Air force officials, Indian embassy officials and government representatives were ready at all times, but Pakistan's tactics were carried out from noon to night

 It is also true that the process of documentation between Pakistan and India was delayed for some time, but this delay was not so much that the return of Abhinandan should take place from noon to night

 But Abhinandan had some doubts
 iske baad vah bharat mata kii jai ke naare lagaae

 Therefore, the party does not want to offend any class
 agar pichde varg se siem banaaya gaya to savarna bidak sakate hai or agar savarna banaaya gaya to pichde naaraaz ho sakate hai
 In such a situation, experts believe that Mahana is getting fit in this mold because she is a Punjabi Khatri and people of any caste will not mind her arrival
 ('local sarkals' kaa survey : logon ne bataai apni apekshaayen or mukhyamantri kaa naam) According to reports, Mahana has worked with PM Narendra Modi in the RSS and this thing is going in his favor
 bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak ke dauraan piem modi ne kaha tha ki kuch aise bhi log hote hai jo lim lite main nahin rahete, lekin kaam acha karte hai

 kulbhushan jadhav ke parivaar se hui badasluki ke mudde par videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne rajyasabha main sarkaar kaa paksh rakhaa
 In the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Sushma reprimanded Pakistan on this issue
 sushamaa ke bayaan kaa vipakshi partiyon ne bhi samarthan kiya
 Sushma in her statement carried out these major attacks on Pakistan
 
 
 1
 In his address to the hanging of the hanging, the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said that the family of Kulbhushan Jadhav had met with diplomatic efforts
 sarkaar ne jadhav maamle ko antarrashtriya court main pesh kiya, jiske baad unpar jari kiye gaye faansee ke faisle ko taal diya gaya he
 In difficult times, the government is with the family, we have fulfilled the desire of the family members to meet Jadhav
 2
 India's chief objector said that Pakistan made the meeting propaganda
 jadhav kii maa sirf sari pahenti hai, unke bhi kapade bhi badalawa die gaye
 The media was allowed to come close to mother and wife, which was against our terms
 na sirf paak media ko aane diya gaya balki taane maare gaye, apshabd diya gaya
 3
 dabaav main hai kulbhushnamulakaat se lautne ke baad maa-patni ne bataaya ki kulbhushan dabaav main hai
 Jadhav was speaking only by his captors who asked him to speak
 pakistan jadhav kii maa-patni ke juuton ke saath kuch sharaarat kar saktaa he
 Only human rights rules have been violated in this meeting
 yahaan padhein puraa bhaashan
 
 
 
 jadhav kii maa-patni ko vidhwaa kii tarah milaayaa, PAK kii brudabi kii had: sushamaa4
 Presented by the widow as a widow, Kulbhushan asked the first question how Baba is
 sushamaa ne kaha ki donon suhaganon ko ek vidhwaa kii tarah pesh kiya gaya
 Jadhav's mother wanted to talk to her son in Marathi
 jab wo baat karti thi, to interkom ko band kiya gaya
 5
 jaanboojh kar roki gai maa-patni kii karbharat ke dipti hai kamishnar ko bina bataae, parivaar ko peeche ke daravaaje se le jaaya gaya
 The car that was given after the meeting was deliberately stopped so that the media there could disturb it
 kataaksh kar saken
 6

 The shoes were not returned even after repeated demands
 ve sharaarat karne vaale the, isliye note main bhej diya gaya tha
 Now it has been proved that the shoe had a camera, it was metal
 pakistan main jane se pehle airport par do jagah maa or patni kii chacking hui, to kya jab koi chip nahin dikhaai di
 The entire House condemns this behavior of Pakistan
 vipaksh ne kiya sarkaar kaa samarthancongress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke bayaan kaa samarthan kiya
 He said that all the allegations against Jadhav are false and fake
 pakistan main koi loktantr nahin he, ham pakistan ko acchhee tareeke se jaanate hai
 Whatever has happened to Jadhav's mother-wife, that insult is the whole country
 congress ke alaava anya sabhi partiyon ne bhi sarkaar ke bayaan kaa samarthan diya

 Freight needs more attention
 tippaniyan Lalu said that he had taken many initiatives during his tenure to improve the condition of the railway, but it was not implemented
 maal dhulaai ke liye ludhiana se haavda ko jodne or pashchimi koridor ke liye mumbai dilli ko jodne ke liye pariyojna shuru kii gai thi, lekin us taraf koi dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa he
 Railways should promote freight trains
 unhone kaha, maine warehoucing or mil vyapaariyon ke liye maal dhulaai ke liye unhen malgadee kii suvidha dene kii pahal kii thi
 Before the hike in petrol, diesel and cooking gas prices, Lalu suggested a meeting with all parties from the Center
 unhone kaha ki is bare main sarvadaleey baithak ke madhyam se sahmati banani chahie, taaki rajya sarkaar petroleum padaarth par lagane vaale karon ko kam karen
 In response to another question, Lalu said, there is no possibility of mid-term elections in the country

 The situation of the railway is not going to improve now
 ab bade-bade kaam karne vaale thekedaaron ko paisa tak nahin mil rahaa he
 Criticizing the increase in railway fares by the central government, he said, what will come from increasing rail fares? This will only lead to criticism
 maal dhulaai par adhik dhyaan dene kii darkaar he
 The comments lalu ne kaha ki unhone railway ke halaat sudhaarney ke liye apane kaarykaal main kai pahal kii thi, lekin us par amal nahin kiya gaya
 The project was started to connect Ludhiana to Howrah for freight and Mumbai Delhi for Western Corridor, but no attention is being paid to that
 railway ko malgadiyon ko badhaava dena chahie
 He said, i had taken the initiative to give them the facility of freight train for warehousing and mill traders
 petrol, dijal or rasoi gas kii keemton main badhotaree se pehle lalu ne centre se sabhi dalon ke saath baithak karne kaa suzav diya
 He said that an agreement should be made about this through an all-party meeting, so that the state government should reduce the taxes on petroleum products

 Lok Sabha elections will be held on time

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said that 1 in coal block allocation
 86 lakh karod rupee kaa nuksaan hone ke kaig ke anumaan ko lekar shuru main kuch andeh hua tha, lekin inamen se keval 10 pratishat khaanon kii nilaamee se hi 1
 10 lakh crore rupees is no longer a doubt
 iti companiyon ke sanghathan 'neshnal associysan of saftware and savirsij companyj (nascom) ke ek kaarykram main modi ne kaha ki kisi ek tabake se 'patr milane ke baad' koyala block aabantan kii puraani vyavastha ko khatm karte hue rajg sarkaar ne paardarshee i-nilaamee prakriya shuru kii jiske jariye sabhi koyala blaak kii nilaamee kii ja rahi he

 10 lakh karod rupee praapt hue
 ' sarkari lekha niyantrak kaig ne apni report main kaha tha ki upie sarkaar ke dauraan koyala block aavanton se 1
 a loss of Rs 86 lakh crore is estimated

 The auction process has been initiated after the Supreme Court canceled the allocation of 204 coal blocks in September last year

 After the title win over Sri Lanka in the 2011 World Cup final played at the Wankhede Stadium, Indian players took Sachin on his shoulder and circled the entire stadium
 yah sachin ke khel kariyar kaa pehla vishwa cap khitaab or ek lihaaj se sabase badi uplabdhi thi
 Two years later, Sachin got exactly the same view in Kolkata that he had seen in 2011 in Mumbai
 unki team ne chennai super kings ko haraakar ipel khitaab par pehali baar kabja kiya
 In Kolkata too, the players of Mumbai Indians made Sachin sit on the shoulder and circled the stadium
 sachin ne ipel ke baad kaha ki vah ab twanti-20 cricket main nahin khelenge lekin sabko achanmbhit karte hue unka naam champiens lig team main shaamil kiya gaya
 Sachin then said that this would be his last Twenty20 tournament
 sachin ke liye yah aayojan vyaktigat lihaaj se khaas nahin rahaa kyonki vah paanch pariyon main 15, 5, 0, 35 or 15 ran hi bana sake lekin unki team final main pahunchi or rajasthan royles ko haraakar khitaab bhi jeet liya
 This time too Sachin was rotated by his comrades sitting on his shoulder in the Ferozeshah Kotla ground
 kismat sachin par itani meharbaan he ki teen saal pehle tak yah kaha ja rahaa tha ki sachin kaa kariyar vishwa cap khitaab ke bagaiyr hi samaapt ho jayega lekin ab unke kariyar main teen bade khitaab shaamil ho chuke hai
 Not only this, the Indian team has also reached the top of the Test rankings while in their team

 The time for the Congress government to take economic decisions was already gone


 So what Chidambaram said today was not expected to do much, but still


 Declarations like ‘one rank – one pension’ for the soldiers
 It was an attempt to save the falling popularity of the Congress
 is ghoshnaa ke turant baad rahul gandhi ne media se mukhaatib hokar iskaa shrey bhi lene kii koshish kii or kaha ki bahut saare phogiyon ke delygation ne unase is vishay par mulaakaat kii thi
 Together it was also clear in a tradition where nothing can be done on tax

 chidambaram ne ek baar phir upie sarkaar kii 10 saal kii tarakkee kii kahani doharaai


 or krishi ke kshetra main tarakkee ko mubaarakabaad di
 But the question here is very clear that through the advertisements of television, newspaper and radio, will the anger of the people towards the UPA government counting its achievements, be less than the praise of this progress? uttar pradesh ke greater noida main kasana thana kshetra us vakt goliyon kii aawaaj se gunj uthaa jab do bike savaar badmaashon or police ke bich muthbhed shuru hui

 police ne is maamle main agyaat ke khilaaf maamla darj kar somvaar ko mubir kii soochna ke aadhaar par do bike savaar badmaashon ko gheraa to badmaashon ne police par firing shuru kar di
 Two police soldiers were injured in the firing, but in this operation, a reward of 25 thousand crook Sanjay was injured, who was declared dead in the hospital
 vahiin ek badmaash bhaagane main kaamyaab ho gaya
 The deceased crook, Mukim, belonged to the Kala Gang, who had been demanding Rs
 50 lakh on phone from the BJP leader last three days
 vahiin police ne maukey se ek motor cycle, ek tamancha ke saath kuch kaartoos baraamad kiye hai or faraar badmaash kii talash main jute gai he
 Jawans Vinay and Sachin injured in the encounter have been admitted to the hospital for treatment
 police jaanch main saamne aayaa he ki mritak badmaash sanjay mukeem kaala gang kaa sharp shooter tha or is parkareeb 3 darjan mukademedarj hai

 Shinde said, 'I hope that the response time of 8-10 minutes before the arrival of these new vehicles will decrease, but it will depend on your efficiency

 The special thing is that no one has the right to audit the grant received by this institute
 antiaro ko ab tak kareeb aath hazaar karod rupee sarkaar se mili hai, lekin is rakam kaa koi hisaab-kitaab nahin diya gaya he
 The audit was conducted for the first time at the intervention of the Prime Minister, then it was known that there was a huge mess with the security of the country
 kargil yuddh ke baad bane antiaro ne yuavi kharidne ke liye varsh 2006 main israeli company israel airospes industries (israel Aerospace Industries) ke saath qaraar kiya tha
 Only Rs 300 crore was approved to buy this UAV, but the purchase amount was later increased to Rs 450 crore

 Not only this, in the year 2007, these uavs were purchased only on the claim of the Israeli company that they had passed the tests in Australia, while according to the rules they were required to be tested in India

 Amit Shah said that there is no atmosphere to hold assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, so extend more President's rule for 6 months
 vahiin congress saansad manish tiwari ne jammu kashmir main raashtrapati shashan ko badaye jane ke sarkaar ke prastaav kaa virodh kiya
 Union Home Minister Amit Shah said that when no party was ready to form a government in the state, Governor's rule was imposed in Kashmir
 iske baad vidhansabha ko bhang karne kaa faisla rajyapal ne liya tha
 On 9 December 2018, the period of Governor's rule came to an end and then it was decided to impose President's rule from December 20 using Section 356
 loksabhaa main kendriya grahamantri amit shah ne kaha ki 2 july ko chah maah kaa antaraal khatm ho rahaa he or isliye is raashtrapati shashan ko badhaayaa jaae kyonki vahaan vidhansabha astitv main nahin he
 Amit Shah said in the Lok Sabha that the Election Commission will decide to hold elections later this year and will be informed about it

 Premachandran said that this bill has now been brought for political gains and i oppose it
 unhone kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav ke saath kashmir main vidhansabha chunaav kyon nahin karaae gaye, vah chunaav bhi shantipurna tareeke se ho jate

 There is a provision to dispose of this biomedical waste in a different way so that no infection goes out through the medical waste, but it is surprising that these dangerous waste materials are thrown very carelessly anywhere
 biomedical westke dyspose main barti ja rahi laaparvaahee ke liye MCD ne bhi related agenciyon ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya
 The MCD also referred to the disposal of different wastes differently through its garbage separation method and also advised the responsible agencies to be strict for this

 america seenet ne kerri lugar bill ko aam sahmati se paarit kar diya he jiske tahat pakistan ko america se milane vaali asainya sahaayta teen guna badhkar agle paanch saal main 7

 iske saath hi yah vidheyak anya paanch saal ke liye bhi itani hi raashi die jane kii vakaalat karata he jisase pakistan ko milane vaali america asainya sahaayta 10 saal main 15 arab america dollars ke aankade par pahunch jaaegi
 Unlike the House of Representatives version of the HR 1886 bill that was passed on June 11 (against which Republicans voted), the Carrie Lugar bill, called Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act, has bipartisan support from senators and the Obama administration
 obama prashasan ne vidheyak ke pratinidhi sabha sanskaran pakistan anduring assistance and kooparation enhencement act of 2009 (echaar 1886) par apana samarthan vyakt nahin kiya jo sahaayta ke badale pakistan par kadi sharte lagane kii baat karata he
 HR 1886 was passed by the House of Representatives on 11 June
 donon vidheyak ko ek karne kii taiyaaridonon vidheyakon echaar 1886 or es 962 main aapasi matbhed hai isliye pratinidhi sabha or seenet ab donon dastavejon ko milkaar ek karne par aam sahmati banane ke liye baithak karengi; iske baad ise america raashtrapati ke hastakshar ke liye bheja jayega taaki yah kanoon kaa rup praapt kar sake
 After the bill was passed in the Senate, Senator John Carrey, chairman of the unanimous foreign affairs committee on the bill, said on the issue of the President's signature being sent to the White House, that i should work with my colleagues in the House of Representatives on this bill Hope to go videsh maamalon kii seenet samiti ke prabhaavshaalee sadsy seenetter richard lugar ne kaha pakistan ke saath satat aarthik or raajnneetik sahyog kii disha main yah vidheyak ek mahatvapurn kadam he
 Calling for progress in the modalities, Llugar said that the bill included keeping in mind that Pakistan is using the money to fight Al Qaeda and the Taliban
 unhone kaha vidheyak main swatantra nyaaypalika kendriya sarkaar ke ucch daayitv, maanavadhikaron ke sammaan, sena, khufia, agenciyon or satta par naagarik niyantran sahit shasneey taur tareekon main pragati kaa bhi aahvaan kiya gaya he
 In order to ensure that the fund is used effectively in a concrete strategy, the army does not include the military in civilian assistance
 The bill includes a lot of important information certification and monitoring of things like accounting of the system
 kerri or lugar ne sanyukt bayaan main kaha ki pakistan se sambandhit is vidheyak ke mahatvapurn praavdhaanon main se ek praavdhaan ke anusaar is asainya sahaayta main sena shaamil nahin he
 Earlier, the security assistance provided to Pakistan was much higher than the development assistance, which allowed the Pakistani Army to set aside policy keeping in mind its institutional interests, bypassing the civil administration
 sanyukt bayaan main kaha gaya he ki kerri lugar vidheyak ke tahat ab aarthik sahaayta sainya sahaayta se pichhadi nahin rahegi
 Bypassing Indian concern, the passage of this bill yesterday seems to have ignored the Indian leaders' concern about the use of Pakistan's land for terrorist attacks on India
 america seenet main kal aam sahmati se paarit is vidheyak ke bare main ab america raashtrapati kii ore se yah pushti kiye jane kii jarurat he ki pakistani suraksha bal taliban ko afghanistan par hamale karne ke liye pakistani bhubhag kaa istemaal sarangah ke taur par karne se rokane kaa samanvit prayaas kar rahe hai
 By ignoring this bill of India, it seems that while passing this bill supported by the Obama administration, the focus is on Afghanistan and it is related to attacks by terrorist organizations like lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed in different parts of India
 Silence is about while the US is fully aware of these attacks
 sahaayta ke liye shart hatayasch to yah he ki lashkar e taiyaba or jaish e mohammad ko sanyukt raashtra dwaara aatankwaadi sanghathan ghoshit kiye jane main america kii bhoomika ahm thi
 This was stated in the initial part of the draft of the bill passed in the House of Representatives on June 11 and a condition was laid for Pakistan that it would not allow its territory to be used for terrorist attacks on India but to express resentment of Islamabad and This part was removed after the Obama administration objected

 dilli ke siem or aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal dwaara ek twit ko ri-twit karne par vivaad ho gaya he
 In fact, musician Vishal Dudlani tweeted on Monday, 'we are stuck between a fool and a murderer
 ab bharat kaa kya hoga
 The language of this tweet by Dudlani is extremely objectionable
 is twit ko congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi or bijepi ke piem ummidavaar va gujarat ke siem narendra modi ke sandarbh main dekha ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, Kejriwal is seen getting caught in a new controversy by re-tweeting this tweet
 Stuck between a moron and a murderer
 
 
 
 what now, India!?— VISHAL DADLANI (@vishaldadlani)january 27, 2014bijepi netaa nirmala sitaraman ne kejariwal ke ri-twit kii ninda kii he
 He said that such a re-tweet by Kejriwal had no meaning
 saarvajanik manch par unhen apni bhashaa kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Sitharaman warned CM Kejriwal that he should take precautions before tweeting
 dadlani kaa yah twit rahul gandhi ke us intervyuu ke baad saamne aayaa jisamen congress upaadhyaksh ne 2002 gujarat dange ke liye narendra modi kii gujarat sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 After this interview of Rahul, Vishal Dudlani tweeted this which was re-tweeted by Kejriwal shortly after
 dadlani ke chakkar main phir fanse kejarivalkejariwal or aam aadmi party ke samarthak vishaal apane karnaamon se pehle bhi vivaadon main rahe hai
 Kejriwal and Company had a lot of displeasure with Didlani's controversial words during campaigning for the Delhi Assembly elections
 darasal, chunaav prachaar ke dauraan dadlani ne aam aadmi party ke virodhiyon ke liye aapattijanak shabdon kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Dadlani made Bollywood songs 'bachna Ae Haseeno'
 
 
 ' kii tarj par 'bachanaa e kaminon
 
 
 Here you come
 
 
 ' gaaya tha
 At the time all this was happening, Arvind Kejriwal and party leader and candidate from RK Puram assembly seat Shazia Ilmi were also present there
 chunaavon se pehle bade-bade vaade karne vaale dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke vaadon kii pole sirf chah maheene ke kaarykaal main hi khulti najar aa rahi he
 Kejriwal, who surrounded the previous governments on the issue of inflation and corruption, is now seen getting caught in his own spread net
 darasal, mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne janata se vaade to kar die lekin unhen puraa karne main unke paseene chhot rahe hai, phir chaahe vah mahangaai kaa mudda ho yaa bhrashtachar kaa
 These are the five issues on which the 'aam Aadmi' government changed its course
 bhrashtachar ke maamalon main karrwai kaa kadava sachbhrashtachar ke khilaaf acshan ke hordings puri dilli main najar aa rahe hai
 On these big hoardings, the Kejriwal government is claiming that the war against corruption has started
 ek RTI ke jawaab main is baat kaa khulaasa hua he ki hordings main kejariwal sarkaar 35 afasaron kii giraftaar kaa daawa to kar rahi he lekin isamen keval ek afasar hi he baaki nichle str ke karmchaaree hai
 Delhi ACB said that a total of 41 people have been arrested till July 1, 2015 after the formation of the Kejriwal government
 inamen teen aise bhi log shaamil hai, jin par 10 rupee rishwat lene kaa shaq jataayaa gaya he
 Not only this, there are some people who have nothing to do with the government
 giraftaar logon main se ek maatr chif ejeeniyar ko chhodkar baaki saare aaropee nichle str ke karmchaaree hai

 400 karod ke ghotaale kii report dabaakar baithi he AAP sarkaarshila dikshit sarkaar ke dauraan hue bhrashtachar ke maamalon main jaraa si bhi narmi na baratane vaada karne vaale kejariwal shaayad satta sukh bhogane main itane vyast ho gaye ki unhen vaadon kaa khyaal hi nahin rahaa
 The Kejriwal government constituted a committee about a month ago to investigate the Rs 400 crore scam involving water tankers during the Congress government in Delhi and asked it to submit a report in 10 days
 sutron ke mutabik, is maamle main cameti ne nirdhaarit samay ke andar apni report sarkaar ko saunp bhi di lekin yah kisi ko nahin maaloom kii report ab kiske paas he or sarkaar ne us par kya ection liya he
 Law Minister Kapil Mishra of the Kejriwal government has also denied any information regarding the report
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya kejariwal sarkaar report ko dabaanaa chaahati he?3
 Dirty Politics Continues on Onion Prices! Delhi government, which is crying out on inflation, ignored the public interest and started politics on onion too
 jab nafed dilli sarkaar ko saste rate par pyaaj dene ko raji thi to sarkaar ne chitthee likhakar unke saamne apni ajeebogareeb sharten rakh deen
 Last Friday, the Delhi government sent a letter to NAFED in which it was written that the Delhi government wishes to buy onions from NAFED but has two conditions
 pehali shart ye ki pyaaj kii keemat 19 rupye hi honi chahie usase zyada nahin or is 19 rupye main bhandaaran nuksaan jise storage los kehete hai or parivahan yani transportesan kaa kharch bhi shaamil he or duusari ye ki pyaaj kii delivery bhi sarkaar ko dilli ke anand vihaar main chahie, na ki wo nasik se pyaaj legi
 On the opening of the poll, the government and party leaders completely retracted and said that they did not write any letter, whereas NAFED has all the letters

 VAT was relaxed and the Aam Aadmi's pocketkeeping government passed a VAT (VAT) amendment bill in the budget session, putting money in the pocket of the common man
 is act ke bhaag 4 kii chauthi anusuchee main darjan bhar se zyada vastuon par waite kii daron ko adhiktam 30 fisadi karne kii baat kahi gayi he
 The Kejriwal government also increased entertainment-tax by 100 per cent, after which it became expensive to watch cinema in Delhi
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hoti ab dilli main duusare rajyon se maal lekar aane vaale malwahak vaahanon ko 100 rupee se lekar 1500 rupee tak tex ke taur par chukaane honge
 Not only this, the Kejriwal government also increased the burden on the common man by increasing VAT on the purchase of petrol and diesel
 5
 When Kejriwal himself said that these promises will not be fulfilled, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has confessed the truth of not fulfilling his promises in the third month of assuming power
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar paanch saal chalegi lekin janata se kiye gaye vaadon kii list main 50 fisadi vaade hi puure kiye ja sakenge
 Kejriwal himself has been accusing BJP and Congress that both these parties make a lot of promises to the public but do not fulfill them, but Kejriwal could only speak bluntly when it came to himself
 chunaav jeetne ke liye unhone lubhaavne vaadon kaa pahaad to khadaa kar liya lekin jab puraa karne kii naubat ai to pehle hi haath khadey kar liye

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni maintained his silence on the IPL spot-fixing scandal
 iske alaava unhone unako lekar paidaa hui ‘hiton ke takaraav’ ke vivaad par bhi kuch nahin kaha
 Dhoni was asked if recent controversies in Indian cricket could have an impact on the team's performance in the Champions Trophy
 unhone badi khubsuurati se yah sawaal taal diya
 The Indian captain said, "we are not thinking about all these things and these things are not even in our mind
" hamaari nigahen keval aage kii chunauti par lagi hai
 We will play outside India for the first time under new rules and we need to reconcile with them as soon as possible

 '' Comments jab yah pataa chalaa ki reeti sports jo unke alaava suresh raina, ravinder jadeja or pragyan ojha kaa prabandhan dekhati he, main dhoni ke 15 pratishat share hai to vah bhi vivaadon ke ghere main aa gayi
 He was severely criticized by some former cricketers for their conflict of interest
 dhoni ne isse pehle mumbai main ravaanagi se pehle or phir yahaan pahunchane par bhi spot phixing masale par bolne se inkaar kar diya tha
 He had said, "when i did not reply to Indian journalists, you see no reason to answer me
" bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘‘ham in sab baton ke bare main nahin soch rahe hai or ye baaten hamaare dimag main bhi nahin hai
 Our eyes are only on the challenge ahead

 kuch purv cricketron ne hiton ke takaraav ke liye unki kadi aalochana kii thi
