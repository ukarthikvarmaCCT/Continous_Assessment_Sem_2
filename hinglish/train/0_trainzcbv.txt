 As part of its latest attempt to gain access to pakistani-american terrorists, India has urged US authorities to "temporarily" hand over Headley to her for a year
 america ne hedli ke pratyrpan main aakshamata jataai, jiske baad bharat ne yah aagrah kiya
 This request was made during the india-us Home Security Dialogue held in Washington last month
 us vaarta main hissaa le chuke ek sheersh bhartiya adhikari ne pitiai ko bataaya, america vaartakaron ne is aagrah par sakriyatapurvak vichaar karne kaa hamen aashwaasan diya
 The US also assured India that it would positively consider Headley's extradition to Rana, a Canadian friend of Pakistani origin
 rana ne pakistan aadhaarit aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba ke liye 26 november ke hamalon ke liye jayja lene main hedli kii madad kii thi
 Following India's continued pressure, the US indicated to negotiators that India could be given access to Headley for a second time, so that it could obtain more information about the conspiracy to conduct the 2008 attacks
 ab tak america ne rana se poochtacha karne kaa koi avasar nahin diya tha
 The comments denmark main sajeesh rachane main apni sanliptata ko lekar rana ko ek america adaalat se sajaa sunai gai he
 Indian investigators believe that Headley and Rana have a lot of information and questioning them will shed more light on the conspiracy behind the Mumbai attack

 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is admitted in AIIMS Hospital in New Delhi since Monday afternoon and his health is constantly improving
 desh ke log unke jald thik hone kii dua maang rahe hai
 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has presented many such examples in political life which are remembered again and again
 ek aisa hi kissa 1971 ke daur kaa he
 a speech in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Parliament is often discussed in which he allegedly addressed then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as Durga
 varsh 1971 main atal bihari vaajapeyi vipaksh ke netaa the or indira gandhi desh kii pradhanmantri
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee went a step ahead as the leader of the opposition, calling Indira 'durga'
 vaajapeyi ne yah shabd indira ko us samay yah upama di jab bharat ko pakistan par 1971 kii ladaai main ek badi kamyaabi hasil hui thi
 In the 1971 war, 90,368 soldiers and civilians from Pakistan surrendered
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ne sadan main kaha tha ki jis tarah se indira ne is ladaai main apni bhoomika adaa kii he, vah vaaki kaabil-e-tarif he
 There was a debate on war in the House and Vajpayee said that we should leave the debate and talk about Indira's role which was not less than any Durga
 patrkaar vijay trivedi kii kitaab ‘haar nahin maanoonga- ek atal jivan gaatha’ main bhi is baat kaa zikr miltaa he
 The book claimed that Vajpayee told DPT in a meeting, "indira did not learn anything from her father Nehru
" mujhe dukh he ki maine unhen durga kaha
 "when Vajpayee became PM two decades after the incident, he flatly denied Durga's statement in an interview to another TV journalist Rajat Sharma
 atal ne tab kaha, maine indira ke liye durga upama kaa istemaal nahin kiya tha
 Some newspapers published this news based on what they had heard
 maine agle din iskaa khandan kiya, to use kone main samet diya gaya

 uk The Shiva temple at Manikarnika Ghat in Uttarkashi, which was hitting the strong waves of the Ganges for the last forty five days, finally merged into the Ganges
 udhar, bhagirathi ke tat par nagpuri main maujuud bhavy ganga shiv mandir bhi ganga main samaa gaya
 This temple of Ganga had come under threat due to the heavy velocity of Ganga and the angry Ganga took it with her
 maa ganga kaa yah mandir taash ke patton kii manind bharbarakar gir gaya
 It is believed about this temple of historical and mythological importance that Shiva himself comes here to this ghat and not only bathes in the Ganges, but also fulfills the wishes of the people by staying here
 lekin is baar krodhit ganga ne na is shiv mandir ko bakhsha, na ganga mandir ko
 Once again, what came here in front of the Ganges, was destroyed
 ganga ke is krodh ko dekhakar log ab dehshat main hai, kyonki ab tak logon ko bhagwaan kaa hi aasraa tha
 Now that God is not safe, those in trouble will have to think for themselves about their safety
 kehete hai premi apni premika kaa pyaar paane ke liye kuch bhi kar gujarata he
 It must be true that the matter of breaking the moon and stars, but what the three lovers did in Baghpat, they have definitely taken them behind bars
 darasal hua ye ki bagpat ke teen chaatro ne ladakiyon kaa pyaar paane ke liye tantric ke kehane par kabron ko khod daalaa
 All three students are graduating and took such a step, surrounded by superstition
 tantric ne unase murde kii haddi laakar uskaa taabeej banane kii baat kahi thi, jisase ve kisi bhi ladki ko paa sakate hai
 With the help of a person from the village, these three friends dug up the grave, as soon as the information is received, a large amount of police has been deployed in the village cemetery
 kabr khodne vaale vyakti or do chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he, jabaki tantric or ek chaatr faraar hai
 To get the love of a lover, Ashiq cuts the veins of the hand, you must have also heard about lovers giving life and taking love
 lekin kisi ladki kaa pyaar paane ke liye murde kaa sahaara lene kaa yah sambhavat: pehla maamla hoga
 In fact, the atmosphere in Jauhari village of Binauli police station area of baghpat district got heated when news of the burial of the tombs in the village cemetery spread
 khabar failte hi log kabristaan kii ore daud pade or isse pehle kii maahaul kharaab hota, kai thanon kii police bhi maukey par pahunch gai
 Police officers also reached the spot and in the meantime someone raised suspicion on three boys from the village, including Arjun, Sonu and Anuj
 ye teenon kabristaan ke baahar dekhe gaye the
 After this, without delay, the police first closed the dug graves and then arrested the accused
 police ne anuj or sonu ke saath majdoor karmpal ko bhi giraftaar kar liya
 The three students had brought Karmapala on the pretext of getting a bundle of bidi of 20 rupees
 giraftaar chaatro ne bataaya ki unhone ladki se dosti karne ke liye ye kaam kiya, kyonki unase koi ladki dosti nahin kar rahi thi
 Meanwhile, he met a tantric, who asked him to bring the corpse bone, which would make him an amulet for him
 tantric ne unase vaada kiya tha ki is taabeej ko dhaaran karne ke baad ladki unase dosti karne ke liye majaboor ho jaaegi
 a student Arjun and Tantrik are still not caught by the police, but the police claim that they will be arrested soon

 There is a growing tension between the Grand Alliance in Bihar
 guuruuvaar ko argedy ke maner se vidhayak bhai virendra ne nitish sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kii dhamkee di thi
 He had said that the JDU should not forget that RJD has 80 mlas, the Grand Alliance will have what it wants
 vahiin ab shuukravaar ko jediu kii ore se rajd ko karaara jawaab diya gaya he
 JDU spokesman Ajay Alok said that power is not necessary for us, he will leave the government within 5 minutes
 vahiin sutron kaa kahana he ki nitish kumaar tejasvi yadav ke istife par ad gaye hai, vahiin rajd bhi tejasvi bhi istife ke mood main nahin he
 It is reported that if Tejashwi Yadav will not resign, Nitish Kumar may resign himself
 sonia ne kii nitish se batjdayu or rajd ke bich upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ke istife ko lekar bad rahe tanaav ke bich congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se phone par baat kii he
 Apart from this, Sonia Gandhi has also talked to Lalu Prasad Yadav
 saaf he ki sonia gandhi tut kii ore bad rahe mahagathbandhan ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahi hai
 jdu's counterattack Ajay Alok said that the leader of Kimhagathbandhan is Nitish Kumar, the people who are threatening 80 mlas should take care that they are not hungry for power, they will give up power in 5 minutes
 nitish kumaar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf apane ravaiye se peeche nahin hatenge
 He said that JDU is still not satisfied with Tejashwi Yadav's cleanliness
 kasee tyaagi bole- ghamand main bayaan de rahe netajediu ke bade netaa kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki rajd ke vidhayak is tarah kaa bayaan ghamand or akad ke saath de rahe hai
 This type of statement should not be given
 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar ne kabhi bhi bhrashtachar ke mudde par samjhauta nahin kiya he, ham log bhrashtachar ke khilaaf hai
 KC Tyagi said that the three parties together have considered Nitish Kumar the leader of the grand alliance, so it is important to pay attention to his questions as well
 kya bole the argedy vidhayak bhai virendrais takaraav ke bich argedy ke maner se vidhayak bhai virendra ne ishaaron-ishaaron main nitish sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kii dhamkee bhi de di
 Talking to reporters, Bhai Virendra said, "it should not be forgotten that RJD has 80 mlas and the Grand Alliance will have what it wants
 ' vahiin jediu ko todakar sarkaar banane ke sawaal par argedy vidhayak ne kaha, ham loktantr main yakeen karte hai
 We are not trying to break any JDU MLA
 ye he argedy kii ranneetiwahin, argedy ke ranneetikaar ye bhi maan kar chal rahen he ki nitish kumaar zyada din tak tejasvi par karrwai taal nahin sakate
 In such a situation, they are also strategizing about their options
 ranneeti ke mutabik tejasvi yadav ko agar barkhaast kiya jaataa he to argedy ke sabhi mantri bhi istipha de sakate hai
 But even after doing so, the RJD will not withdraw support from the Nitish government
 samarthan jari rakhegi argediargedy sutron kaa kahana he ki argedy janata dal united sarkaar ko samarthan detii rahegi taaki wo phir se bijepi ke saath na chali jaye
 On the other hand, RJD also does not want it to be out of the government on this delicate occasion
 kyonki lalu prasad yadav kaa parivaar sibiai or idi ke cese main fansaa he
 In such a situation, staying without government can weaken them
 haalanki, argedy congress ke saath kuch nirdaleey yaa phir jediu main yadav vidhayakon ke bharose sarkaar banane ke vikalp par bhi vichaar kar sakati he
 Schools reopened after three months in the valley, but most children remained absent from class
 ghati main surakshabalon or karfu todane waalon ke bich lagaataar hui hinsak jhadpon ke chalate sarkaar ne tamaam skool band karne ke aadesh die the
 If the situation improved a little, the schools were reopened from today, but it seems that Hurriyat did not like it
 sanghathan ke kattarpanthi netaa saiyad ali shah gilaani ne apni maangon ke samarthan main aaj band bula liya
 Geelani asked people not to send their children to school-colleges
 isi kaa asar he ki zyaadaatar bachche skool nahin pahunche
 The education and education of children has been badly affected due to the continuous violent clashes and curfew in the valley for the last about three months
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne lachar farm main chal rahe apane ballebaajon kaa bachaav karte hue mangalvaar ko kaha ki trikoniya ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa main newjiland ke khilaaf buudhvaar ko hone vaale karo yaa maro vaale match main unki team ko kisi ek khilaadi se badi or bejod pari kii jarurat he
 Dhoni told a press conference on the eve of the match, 'you want any batsman to play a big innings in every match, especially on such a wicket
 ise kisi ek khilaadi kaa behtareen pradarshan kaha ja saktaa he kyonki aapkaa ek ballebaaj ek chor sambhaal kar rakhata he or duusare uskaa saath dete hai
 He said, 'it depends largely on your mindset because in ODI cricket you have to dominate the bowlers from the very first ball and play the shot
 keval upmahadweep main hi nahin puri duniya main aap dekhenge ki visheshkar ekadivasiy maichon ke liye wicket kaaphi sapaat banaaye ja rahe hai
 Dhoni said, "if you talk about batting collapse then it has happened twice in three matches but if it is said that our team's batting is so strong then i don't agree with it
 ek baat kaa ham khandan nahin kar sakate ki hamaare ballebaaj do match main asafal rahe or is samasya se paar paanaa hoga
 We have to make good runs by staying on the wicket
 ’dhoni ne sweekaar kiya ki newjiland ke khilaaf 200 ran or srilanka ke khilaaf aath wicket kii karaari haar ko pachaa paanaa aasaan nahin he lekin unhone kaha ki team isse ubarne main sakasham he
 He said, 'we are very disappointed as a team
 lekin aapane dekha hoga ki sabhi match ekatarfa rahe jisase saaf hota he ki yadi aapane shuru main hi kuch wicket ganvaa diye to ballebaaji patan ho jaataa he
 We have seen this happen throughout the tournament
 ’bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘ballebaaj apni ranneeti par kaam kar rahe hai
 They are not getting out by playing the wrong shot
 ve apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karnaa chaahate hai lekin kai baar aisa nahin hota he
 This is what happened when our batting collapsed in the last two matches
 isliye jab bhi aap krij par hote hai to aapako ran banane kaa rasta dhundhna hoga kyonki dabaav lagaataar badhata jaataa he
 He said, 'you should look at the strong side of a player
 koi khilaadi team main kis tarah kii majbootee laa saktaa he
 Take Ravinder Jadeja only

 shravasti main 2010 ke ant main jab jila panchayat adhyaksh kaa chunaav hua to yahaan bahujan samaaj party (basapa) samarthit ummidavaar rukmini singh bina kisi virodh ke jeet gayi
 But after the formation of Samajwadi Party (SP) government, she started knocking the members of the Zilla Panchayat
 sadasyon ke avishvaas prastaav se jab unki kursi jane kaa khatra mandaraaya to unhone apane pati ram pratap singh samet sapa kii sadsyta le lee
 Raman Singh, the district panchayat member of Shravasti, says, "rukmini made no effort to improve the condition of the villages after becoming the panchayat president
" '' haalanki rukmini kahati hai ki unhone kursi bachaane ke liye party nahin badali he
 a similar incident has come to light in Rampur, where the bsp-backed panchayat president Abdul Salam got involved in joining the SP camp as soon as the regime changed
 unke badale rukh kii jaankaree milte hi basapa ne unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 In Hardoi, Kamini Agarwal also won the election of Panchayat President riding on an elephant, but she joined the SP after leaving the BSP as her husband Mukesh Aggarwal rode a bicycle
 ye kuch udhaaharan is ore ishaara karte hai ki rajya kii jila panchayaton main is vakt dalgat nishtha badalane kaa khel shuru ho chukaa he
 In the elections held at the end of 2010, the BSP won the victory on 55 out of the total 72 seats, while the SP had won ten seats
 baaki congress, ralod or bhaajapa ke bich saz hui thim
 The same was also for the election of 813 Kshetra Panchayat presidents (block heads) in the state
 yah satta kii hanak hi thi ki basapa netaaon ne kareeb do darjan siton par apane rishtedaaron ko bagaiyr sadsy kaa chunaav lade jila panchayat adhyaksh kii kursi par bitha diya
 For these district panchayat presidents, the ruling BSP has given a year of no-confidence motion against the area panchayat chief and district panchayat presidents through the 'uttar Pradesh Kshetra Panchayat and Zilla Panchayat Amendment Bill-2011'
 Increased from two years
 haalanki is vidheyak ko rajyapal kii manjuuri nahin mili thi
 But after forming the government with a strong majority, the SP cleared the way for the removal of the said amendment bill and the removal of Baspai District Panchayat President and Block Chiefs
 phir to lagbhag har jile main jila panchayat adhyaksh or block pramukhon ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaavon kii baadh aa gai
 Account opened from Hamirpur
 yahaan basapa pratyaashee sanjay dikshit ko kursi ganvaani padi
 Similarly, Pramod Yadav of Siddharthanagar, Munni Devi Ambedkar's chair in Kannauj was taken away
 azamgarh main varisht basapa netaa gandhi aaazaad ke bhai kii patni mira aaazaad bhi rukhsat ho gayi
 Similarly, Nasreen Saifi of Bijnor, Dilip Maurya of Sonbhadra, Anita Verma of Pilibhit also had to lose their hands from their chair
 mirzapur, lakhanu, meerut, muradabad, bagpat, mujffarnagar, bulandshahr main badlaav kii sugabugahat mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 Ramji Tiwari, former president of the bjp's Panchayat Cell in Barabanki, says that the bsp-backed district panchayat presidents and block chiefs did not do any development work during the tenure of one and a half years
 isse jila or kshetra panchayat sadasyon main baari asantosh tha
 As the tenure of their removal was extended by bringing a no-confidence motion, these district panchayat presidents and block heads used their influence in an autocratic manner
 jis tarah jila panchayat adhyahnon or block pramukhon kii kursi jane kaa khatra mandara rahaa he usase bachane ke liye ye netaa sattarudh dal main thikaana talashne kii kavayad main jute gaye hai
 About three dozen district panchayat presidents and around 100 block chiefs are desperate to come to the SP
 inamen se kai ne panchayatiraj mantri balram yadav se sampark saadhaa he
 Says Yadav, "most of those who have held the chair of the district panchayat president or block chief by pressure of power want to join the SP
" aise logon ko dar he ki pratidwandvi unke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laa sakate hai
 However, SP will not take action against anyone with a vengeance
 ''sapa sarkaar is maamle main bhale hi kisi bhoomika se inkaar kar rahi ho, lekin jis tarah se ek-ek kar basapa ke jila panchayat adhyakshon or block pramukhon ko apni kursi ganvaani pad rahi he, usne rajya ke siyaasi maahaul ko garma diya he
 BSP state president Swami Prasad Maurya says, "the SP has started dismantling the democratic nature of the panchayats as soon as it formed the government
 '' magar sapa ke pradesh pravaktaa rajendra choudhary basapa ke upar palatwaar karte hue kehete hai, ''basapa sarkaar main loktantr ko bandhak banaakar jabardastee kursi kabjane waalon ko ab janata jawaab de rahi he
 '' dishaao kaa sambandh surya or iske prakaash se hota he
 The effect of different light in different directions produces different energy
 alag ham dishaao ko samajhe bina is urja ke sampark main aate hai to isse nuksaan hota he anyathaa thodi si samaj rakhkar ham har disha se khub laabh le sakate hampurv disha kaa mahatv kya he ?- yah disha sabase zyada pavitra or shaktishaalee maani jaati he- is disha kii taraf mukh karke kaary karnaa hameshaa laabhadaayak hota he- yahan par surya or brihaspati kaa prabhaav hota he- is disha se maan sammaan yash or gyaan miltaa he- jahaan tak ho sake puja paath dhyaan or padhipurvadisha kii or mukh karke karen- agar dher sara maan sammaan chahie to purv disha kii ore munh karke bhojan karenpashcim disha kaa mahatv kya he?

 bataa rahaa tha ki chaay patni ke haath kii hi peetaa he
 He knows that faith is nothing
 aatma kuch nahin hoti he
 His children will still consider him great
 chanakyapuri or pandara road ke bachche samajhadaar hote hai
 Do not question with honesty
 aatma se baat nahin karte hai
 The children of Bharti Nagar and Kaka Nagar are also not restless about India
 unhen sahi aankadon kii zarurat nahin he
 They see the figure every evening
 jab maa yaa pita daphtar se ghar aate hai
 Goes to be silent, to come silent
 sapane main us afasar ne ek baat kahi thi
 We do not fear death
 ham maare jane se pehle mar chuke hai
 He thought i would be restless
 maine gita padhi he
 The soul is immortal
 afasar ne kaha ki aatma amar he
 This is the problem
 mare hue logon kii atmaaen bhi amar hoti hai
 His immortality is power
 satta amar he
 One more question
 mere is sawaal par usne manaa kar diya
 i asked
 usne yahi kaha
 People will buy newspapers
 unhen kareedne kii aadat he
 Just like we have a habit of dying
 main neend se jaag gaya tha
 It was raining raisina shaam kii roshni main buundon ke bich dulhan kii tarah lag rahi thi
 One should not sleep while reading George Orwell's 1984 book
 is kitaab ko jo padhegaa, vah sote hue sapana paaegaa
 His dreams will turn pink

 If the news is not published in the newspaper, then the newspaper will still be sold
 channelon main khabar nahin hogi, to channel phir bhi dekhe jaaenge
 Journalists are not required
 vah ab chupake se kahin nahin ja saktaa he
 When readers and viewers can keep quiet knowing this, then what is the problem for the journalist to keep quiet? yahi dikkat he
 It seems that even after millions of people are displaced by climate change, it will never be displaced
 pathak kaa visthaapan nahin hoga
 There will be no displacement of the audience

 This is climate change of democracy

 Thank you readers
 bagair khabaron ke akhbaar karidate rahane ke liye
 To keep watching channels without news
 vittamantri ke faisale kaa swaagat ho
 Shraddha feast on the death of news
 terahavin kaa intazaar na karen
 Banquet should be organized on the day of death
 maine dekha, afasaron kii tarah log bhi nigahen nahin mila rahe the
 i did not see it in my dream
 gahari neend se jaagane ke baad logon se milane ke baad dekha tha
 a viewer did whatsapp
 hamase nazar milaane se pehle ijazat zaruri he
 You can't embarrass someone's pride
 maine editors gild ke faisle kii aalochana kar di
 The Guild had criticized the Finance Ministry's decision
 ab sab thik he
 The soul as well as the officer
 darshak bhi or pathak bhi
 That's the slogan with the inbox
 use mere lekh kaa sheershak samaj nahin aa rahaa he

 The MLA from Kankavali in coastal Sindhudurg district said that he did so in protest against the commissioner's alleged 'neglectful attitude' towards the problems of the traditional fishermen community of the Konkan region
 rane ne phone par kaha, 'sindhudurg main do tarah ke machuaare hai
 One who uses traditional methods for fishing and the other who uses modern technology
 ' unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar ke niyamon ke mutabik, donon samudaayon ke liye machhlee pakadaney ke ilaakon kaa spasht taur par simakan kiya gaya he
 He alleged that modern-day fishermen often enter the area of fishermen fishing in the traditional way, causing damage to them
 rane ne kaha, 'hamane sindhudurg ke matsaypalan ayukta se baat kii or chaar farvari 2016 ke sarkaar ke prastaav ko unke sangyaan main laae jisamen donon samudaayon ke machuaaron ke liye spasht taur par niyamon ko bataaya gaya he

 Rane said on the phone, 'there are two types of fishermen in Sindhudurg
 ek wo jo machhlee pakadaney ke liye paaramparik tareekon kaa istemaal karte hai or duusare wo jo aadhunik takanic kaa istemaal karte hai
 He said that according to the rules of the state government, the fishing areas for both the communities have been clearly demarcated
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki aadhunik tareeke se machhlee pakadaney vaale machuaare paaramparik tareeke se machhlee pakadaney vaale machuaaron ke ilaake main aksar ghuste hai jisase unhen nuksaan hota he
 Rane said, 'we spoke to the fisheries commissioner of Sindhudurg and brought to the notice of the government's proposal of February 4, 2016 clearly stating the rules for fishermen of both communities
 ' unhone kaha, 'matsaypalan ayukta ke jaise adhikariyon ke nazarandaaj karne vaale ravaiye ke kaaran in niyamon ko lagu karne ke liye kuch nahin kiya ja rahaa he jiske kaaran paaramparik machuaaron ko baari nuksaan jhelana pad rahaa he
 Rane, son of senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Narayan Rane, claimed that fishermen from neighboring states also enter the watershed of Maharashtra, adding to the problems of traditional fishermen

 ' unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar ke niyamon ke mutabik, donon samudaayon ke liye machhlee pakadaney ke ilaakon kaa spasht taur par simakan kiya gaya he
 He alleged that modern-day fishermen often enter the area of fishermen fishing in the traditional way, causing damage to them

 "he said," Due to the neglectful attitude of officials like Fisheries Commissioner, nothing is being done to implement these rules, due to which traditional fishermen are suffering heavy losses
 ' varisht congress netaa or purv mukhyamantri narayan rane ke bete rane ne daawa kiya ki padosi rajya ke machuaare bhi maharashtra ke jalakshetra main ghuste hai jisase paaramparik machuaaron kii pareshaani bad jaati he

 38-year-old Ashish Nehra was given due attention to Shami's fast attack
 ashish nehra aakhri baar farvari 2017 main england ke khilaaf tii-20 main khele the
 Nehra, who was struggling for fitness, had taken 8 wickets in 6 matches for Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL-10
 2 - aisa lagata he ki dinesh karthik ko rigerv wicket keeper ke chaur par chunaa gaya he
 It could be a Champions Trophy situation in which he had to return without playing
 haalanki westeindies daure (july 2017) main unhen 2 vanade or ek tii-20 khilne kaa mauka mila
 Is this the reason for choosing Karthik? Dinesh Karthik scored 111 in the first innings while captaining India Red in the Duleep Trophy final
 india red ne khitaabi takkar main suresh rena kii india blue ko 163 ranon se maat di thi
 3 - Ajinkya Rahane, who scored 4 consecutive FIFTY (55, 70, 53 61) in ODI series against Australia, was not given a chance in T20

 Congress spokesperson Shakti Singh Gohil alleges that Gitanjali Gems Limited lashed out Rs 5,000 crore to the common people through fraudulent investment schemes

 According to the Congress spokesperson, it should be asked that why were the Gujarat Police patronizing scamsters like Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi even after complaints were filed in 2017? According to Gohil, from September 7, 2015, not only one but several affidavits came to the notice of the Government of Gujarat

 Being a journalist, i keep a close watch on the news around the world and as a film journalist, it becomes necessary to read some more or not read the film pages of newspapers
 aaj jab filmi khabaren tatoli, dhundhi to dekha kii sani leone kii is hafte release hui film 'kuch kuch locha he' kaa pehle din kaa box offis collection kareeb 50 lakh kaa hi tha
 That is, the fate of Sunny Leoni's film was very bad
 box offis par aisa hashr kisi bhi star or kisi bhi film kaa ho saktaa he
 But the question is, who will Sunny Leoni complain to now? Will she tell the audience that the audience does not want to see her film because of her old image? She can also say that because in the past several times in the morning i saw in the headlines of newspapers, in which Sunny never said about the news channel, 'some channels do not want to interview me because i have been a porn star
 ' One day i even read Sunny's complaint in the newspaper that a lot of stars do not want to work with Sunny
 ab kya sani kii ye shikaayat jaays he? mere najariye se bilkul bhi nahin, kyonki bharat ke patrakaron ne or media ne sani ko khub surkhiyaan di
 It was the channel of India that called him in Big Boss and brought him to the doorstep of India
 ye hakeekat he ki sani vishvabhar main porn star ke naam se jaani jaati hai magar bharat ke darshakon ne unhen is rup se alag dekha or sweekaara, jisamen media ne bhi khub saath diya sani kaa
 On the other hand, Sunny has also complained that many Bollywood stars do not want to work with him and i do not like this complaint of his
 kyonki bollywood main badi se badi abhinetri bhi sabhi stars ke saath kai baar kaam nahin kar paati
 These days Kangana Ranaut is very high but Kangana did not work with any Khan
 vidya baalan 2 saal pehle tak yaa ab bhi badi abhinetri hai magar inhen bhi kisi khan ke saath film nahin mili or aisi darjanon misaalen hai
 Now Kangna and Vidya complain to whom and to whom? Comments mumbai nagari main har saal saikadon ladkiyaan heroin banane aati hai or ankhon main sapane liye yaa to waapas jaati hai yaa kisi or patari par safar shuru kar detii hai
 Dozens of girls appear every day in this city who struggle to become heroines, but they do not have more than 1 or 2 scenes in films but this did not happen with Sunny
 bina kisi bhedbhaav ke mahesh bhatta, sanjay gupta or ekta kapur jaise filmkaaron ne inhen apni filmon main cast kiya
 In such a situation, Sunny should think that despite being a pornstar, India and Bollywood adopted her
 maan sammaan or alag pahchaan diya
 The rest of which film meets with which star or which film is a hit is all a game of luck
 isliye sani ko mumbai se shikaayat nahin balki shukriya adaa karnaa chahie
 Such a fate can be of any star and any film at the box office
 magar sawaal ye he kii sani leyoni ab kisase shikaayat karengi? kya wo darshakon se kahengi ki unki puraani image kii vajah se darshak unki film dekhnaa nahin chaahate? wo kah bhi sakati hai kyonki pichley dinon kai baar subah-subah akhbaaron kii surkhiyon main maine dekha, jisamen sani ne kabhi news channel ke bare main kaha ki 'kuch channel meraa intervyuu nahin karnaa chaahate kyonki main porn star rah chuki hum
 ' ek din to maine akhbaar main sani kii ye bhi shikaayat padhi kii sani ke saath bahut saare star kaam nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 Now is this complaint of Sunny justified? Not at all from my point of view, because journalists in India and the media made a lot of headlines for Sunny
 bharat ke channel ne hi unhen big bos main bulaakar bharat ke ghar-ghar main pahunchaaya
 It is a fact that Sunny is known as the porn star around the world, but the audience of India saw her differently and accepted, in which the media also supported Sunny
 vahiin duusari taraf sani kii ye bhi shikaayat he ki bollywood ke kai sitare unke saath kaam karnaa nahin chaahate or mujhe unki ye shikaayat bhi jaays nahin lagati
 Because even the biggest actresses in Bollywood are not able to work with all the stars many times
 in dinon kangana ranut bahut bulandi par hai magar kangana ne kisi bhi khan ke saath kaam nahin kiya
 Vidya Balan is a big actress till 2 years ago or even now, but she too did not get a film with any Khan and there are dozens of such examples
 ab kangana or vidya kya or kisase shikaayat karen?tippaniyan Every year, hundreds of girls come to Mumbai to become heroines in the city of Mumbai and either go back with dreams in their eyes or start traveling on another track
 aisi darjanon ladkiyaan is shahar main har rose dikhaai detii hai jo heroin banane kii jaddojahad karti hai par unki jagah filmon main 1 yaa 2 seen se zyaada nahin hoti magar sani ke saath aisa nahin hua
 Filmmakers like Mahesh Bhatt, Sanjay Gupta and Ekta Kapoor cast him in their films without any discrimination
 aise main sani ko ye sochna chahie kii pornster hone ke baavjood bhi bharat or bollywood ne unhen apanaaya
 Honor given respect and separate recognition
 baaki koun si film kis star ke saath milti he yaa koun si film hit hoti he ye sab kismat kaa khel he
 So Sunny should not complain to Mumbai but thank her
 ek din to maine akhbaar main sani kii ye bhi shikaayat padhi kii sani ke saath bahut saare star kaam nahin karnaa chaahate hai

 isliye sani ko mumbai se shikaayat nahin balki shukriya adaa karnaa chahie
 On the other hand, Sunny has also complained that many Bollywood stars do not want to work with him and i do not like this complaint of his
 kyonki bollywood main badi se badi abhinetri bhi sabhi stars ke saath kai baar kaam nahin kar paati
 These days Kangana Ranaut is very high but Kangana did not work with any Khan
 vidya baalan 2 saal pehle tak yaa ab bhi badi abhinetri hai magar inhen bhi kisi khan ke saath film nahin mili or aisi darjanon misaalen hai
 Now Kangna and Vidya complain to whom and to whom? Comments mumbai nagari main har saal saikadon ladkiyaan heroin banane aati hai or ankhon main sapane liye yaa to waapas jaati hai yaa kisi or patari par safar shuru kar detii hai
 Dozens of girls appear every day in this city who struggle to become heroines, but they do not have more than 1 or 2 scenes in films but this did not happen with Sunny
 bina kisi bhedbhaav ke mahesh bhatta, sanjay gupta or ekta kapur jaise filmkaaron ne inhen apni filmon main cast kiya
 In such a situation, Sunny should think that despite being a pornstar, India and Bollywood adopted her
 maan sammaan or alag pahchaan diya
 The rest of which film meets with which star or which film is a hit is all a game of luck
 isliye sani ko mumbai se shikaayat nahin balki shukriya adaa karnaa chahie
 Every year, hundreds of girls come to Mumbai to become heroines in the city of Mumbai and either go back with dreams in their eyes or start traveling on another track
 aisi darjanon ladkiyaan is shahar main har rose dikhaai detii hai jo heroin banane kii jaddojahad karti hai par unki jagah filmon main 1 yaa 2 seen se zyaada nahin hoti magar sani ke saath aisa nahin hua
 Filmmakers like Mahesh Bhatt, Sanjay Gupta and Ekta Kapoor cast him in their films without any discrimination
 aise main sani ko ye sochna chahie kii pornster hone ke baavjood bhi bharat or bollywood ne unhen apanaaya
 Honor given respect and separate recognition
 baaki koun si film kis star ke saath milti he yaa koun si film hit hoti he ye sab kismat kaa khel he
 So Sunny should not complain to Mumbai but thank her
 aise main sani ko ye sochna chahie kii pornster hone ke baavjood bhi bharat or bollywood ne unhen apanaaya

 bhale hi aap kitne hi shandaar tareeke se sex kaa lutf uthaate hon, lekin is ko puri tarah se jeene ke liye bistar par apana role nibhaa dene yani sex ke baad bhi aap kii pratikriya bhi bahut myne rakhti he
 How is your behavior immediately after playing the role
 kahin aap munh pher kar so to nahin jate yaa phir sidhe tivi ke remote se chipak jate hai
 Never pay attention to this and test your behavior before, during sex and immediately after it
 bistar par jaayakedaar pal bitaane ke baad bhi aap kii apane saathi se nazdikiyaan or pyaar bhare pal puri tarah barkarar rah sakate hai
 Clinical sexologist Rachel Rose says that hormones increase the ability to connect with someone with a true mind after attaining physical exertion
 lekin is kaa matlab yah katai nahin he ki aap bas ekadusre kii ankhon main dekhen yaa mahaj baaten karen
 By the way, both these options are also not bad, but what to say if something new and different is used
 sex ke baad ke palon main khud ko partner se physicli va imoshnali jode rakhane ke liye badhaaie hamaare saath sirf aath kadam
 
 
 1 If you feel hungry soon after playing your role, then instead of going to the kitchen to find the leftovers or order something from the market, also enjoy soft drinks, this will give you relaxation
 to der kis baat kii is baar sex ke baad le rahe hai na soft drink
 After 2 seconds, going to the washroom just to be fresh, a fun shower option with your partner will thrill you
 nahaate samay ek duusare ko sparsh karen or sharir ke samvedansheel hisson kii halki masti bhari massage den
 Believe this shower will bring you both very close
 3 is main koi shaq nahin ki santushti dene vaala sambandh baad main thakaa detaa he
 But if you apply a little mind, then this fatigue will also take you closer to your partner
 shaareerik sambandh ke baad ek duusare se dur hone ke bajaae apane saathi ke pairon par apane pair ko tikaaen or saath hi apane sir ko un ke seene par rakhen
 With this, the experience you will have with each other has never happened before
 4 apane rishte ko bhi samay rahete samay den
 Do not click any other thing in your mind or the worm of internet, so before you become physical, switch off the button of everything like your laptop, phone or TV
 5 bina physical hue bhi aap sex kaa lutf uthaa sakate hai
 Never spend moments of your life in the same bed without flirting or having fun, you will be filled with a new energy
 6 jab aap uttejnaa bhare palon kaa anand le chuke hon, to kuch samay kamare main mombattiyon kii halki roshni main saath bitaayen
 Surely it will feel very romantic
 7 shaareerik sambandhon ke baad agar aap apni nity khud hi pahenti hai, to is baar use padaa rahane den
 Help your partner get dressed instead of nighty and leave them to you
 nity pehanaane ke liye
 Wearing each other will increase the closeness of both of you
 8 apane phone yaa ypod main romantic gaanon kaa ek foulder bana len
 Choose any song that romanticizes both of you
 use chalaa kar ek saath us kaa anand len
 Recall the moments spent with each other, which are memorable for both of you

 In an interview to party leader Sanjay Raut in the mouthpiece 'saamana', he said in words that if the party is in trouble due to the state government, Shiv Sena will be out of the government
 yahi nahin, unhone yah bhi daawa kiya he ki unki party nagar nigam (biemasi) chunaav akele hi jeetegi
 Significantly, Wednesday 27 July is Uddhav Thackeray's birthday
 mukhpatr main isi babat unka intervyuu kiya gaya he
 In the second installment of this interview published on Tuesday, Uddhav talked about breaking the 25-year-old bjp-shiv Sena alliance
 jabaki somvaar ko isaki pehali kisht main unhone kashmir ke halaat ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 'our 25 years of rot in the yuti', however, Uddhav Thackeray has also praised Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 unhone kaha he, 'mukhyamantri fadanvis acha kaam kar rahe hai, lekin yadi satta kaa istemaal kar shivasena ko gheraa jayega to party sarkaar se sidhe baahar nikal jaaegi
 When would the Shiv Sena's unitary power come, but our 25 years were rotten in the yuti (cooperation)
 'unhone aage kaha, 'mukhyamantri nae hai
 They are doing their best
 asthirataa unke hisse nahin ai he, isliye mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ve acha kaam kar sakenge
 The instability that people are doing within the BJP
 main sarkaar ko asthir karke kabhi blackmel nahin karuunga
 Whatever i speak, i will speak openly
 ''
 
 
 So Shiv Sena will not sit silent 'will the bjp-shiv Sena alliance be in the future as well? Replying to this question, Uddhav said, 'it will depend on both parties
 yadi bijepi apane dam par ladane kaa naaraa lagaaegi to shivasena bhi chup nahin baithegi
 i will also bring the Chief Minister of Shiv Sena
 ye to meraa pran he or yahi meri pramukhataa he
 If all this is not possible with the combination, then there will be no utility
 'hindutv par aadhaarit thi yuti'unhone aage kaha, 'shivasena yadi akele apane balbute par ladati rahi hoti to aaj kii tasviir alag hoti
 Personally, i have no quarrel with the Chief Minister
 hamaari 25 saal kii yuti hindutv par aadhaarit thi, ab kis par he yah tay karnaa hoga
 The Shiv Sena never made any unnecessary allegations

 In the interview given to Sanjar Raut, "from which mouth are the adversaries talking", a new fashion is going on in the state
 keechad uchhaalo or bhaag jaao
 He has also targeted the congress-ncp government of the past

 The BJP has reacted strongly to the statement made by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar regarding triple talaq
 darasal somvaar ko rajgir main janata dal united ke rashtriya parishad ke meeting main nitish ne tripal talaak ke mudde par centre sarkaar ko aagaah kiya ki vah is mudde se apane aap ko dur rakhen or is vishay ko musalamaanon ke upar chhod diya jaae
 In the JDU National Council meeting, Nitish said that who is the center is going to take a decision on the issue of triple divorce
 is vishay ko musalamaanon ke upar chhod dena chahie
 Senior BJP leader Sushil Modi described Nitish Kumar's statement as insulting to Muslim women
 susheel modi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar kaa bayanmuslim mahilaon kaa apmaanhai
 Due to the policy of appeasement, Nitish bowed before the Muslim puppets
 modi ne nitish se sawaal kiya ki agar vah mahilaon ke kehane par rajya main sharabbandi lagu kar sakate hai to phir vah muslim mahilaon ko sammaan or samanta ke adhikaar se kyon vanchit rakhana chaahate hai
 Sushil Modi said that Nitish Kumar's statement is not only retrograde, but also against Muslim women

 bharat ne srilanka ke khilaaf america samarthit prastaav ke paksh main matdaan kiya jabaki pakistan ne yuanechaarsi main prastaav ke vipaksh main matdaan kiya
 Significantly, two days ago, on this issue, the upa's important ally DMK withdrew support from the central government, which increased the political stir in India
 bharat ne sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar parishad main kaha, 'ham srilanka ke sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar ayukta ko nimantran par gaur karte he, ham unase is sambandh main jald se jald karrwai kii apil karte hai
 This proposal has been considerably diluted
 likhit sanshodhano ke jariye bharat ne nayi vishay vastu ko shaamil karavaaya he
 In this, India has called for an independent and credible investigation into allegations of human rights violations and acceptability of other actions by Sri Lanka
 srilanka main sulah or javabdehi ko badhaava dene se jude prastaav ko lekar bharat ke sthaneey pratinidhi dilip sinha ne kaha, ‘hamane maanavadhikaron ke ulanghan ke aaropon or nagarikon ke maare jane ko lekar swatantra evam vishwasaneey jaanch kaa apana aahvaan doharaaya he

 After that she lost the election and her own party Congress supported her government against her opponent Arvind Kejriwal who defeated her
 matlab saafe he ki congress kii praathamikta shila dikshit nahin rah gayi thim
 a formal statement was given that the government was supported on the issues, but whether it was hidden behind these issues that Kejriwal's government will investigate the allegations against Sheila Dixit
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki agar ye jaanch shila dikshit ke kilaaf congress ko or sharmasaar karti he to congress kahaan tak is aam aadmi party kaa saath nibhaa paaegi
 Or these two parties will expose themselves on one side by talking about investigation against a big leader and on the other hand by running the government with their support

 Both Neeraj and Alpana Mittal are designers and live in Delhi

 isi kram main wo buddhist reatreet gayi or vahaan unhen is baat kaa dhyaan aayaa ki ve hameshaa se hijanvaronko paalna chaahati thim
 She decided right there that she would buy a dog, although she never thought that she would bring misguided and street animals to her home
 unke pati bhi rahe baraabar ke saajhedaar
 
 
 It often happens that if a person likes something in a house, then there is something else
 isi chakkar main log apane shauk ko tilanjali de dete hai, lekin niraj ko jaanwaron sekhas sahanubhutinhee thi, itnaa hi nahin ve kutton se daraa bhi karte the
 They continued to be supportive of this concept of Alpana
 aaj ve kul 15 kute-billiyon ke saath rahete hai
 They have handed over the entire floor of their office and their room to these animals
 aksar jaanavar unhen badi kharaab sthiti main milte hai
 
 
 It happens to them many times that animals meet them in very bad conditions

 pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) ke adhyaksh bilaval bhutto jaradaari ek videshi daure par nikal gayi hai or vah 11 may ko tab desh main nahin honge jab chunaav hone hai
 a media report on the Dawn newspaper website quoted PPP sources as saying that 24-year-old Bilawal would not address any rally or public meeting before the general election because of the threat to his life
 pipipi ke varisht netaa taj haidar ne is baat kii pushti kii ki party main aam sahmati ke baad bilaval ko salaah di gayi ki suraksha ko lekar gambhir khatre ke chalate ve chunaav abhiyaan se dur rahen
 He said, 'we have already lost Benazir Bhutto
 unki (bilaval kii) jaan ko bhi khatra he
 He did not reveal where Bilawal is at the moment
 2014 ke pehle kaa media bhi gart main ja rahaa tha, jab vah tiarapy ke liye shmashaan ghat main camere laga rahaa tha or swarg kii seedhi khoj rahaa tha tab uski aalochana hindi cinema ke parde par ho rahi thi
 Films like Shobiz, Page Three, No One Killed Jessica, Guru, Peepli Live and Ran were being made
 2014 ke baad media kii duniya main bahut kuch hua magar uski pratikriya yaa jhalak ko lekar koi pipli live nahin bani
 Things that Bollywood producers were noticing separately before 2014, the same things became part of their lives after 2014
 2008 main vencede jaisi film aatankwaad ko lekar ban rahi thi magar 2014 ke baad jab pathankot par hamale ke baad iesai ke afasar jaanch dal main shaamil ho gaye tab kisi bollywood ke riter ko nahin laga ki ek kahani likhte hai
 The filmgoers filled the plot of making great, disappearing the questions from their stories
 iske baad bhi 2001 main bani nayak film whatsap uniwarsity main mim banakar chalati rahi
 People put a picture of the leaders in front of Anil Kapoor and imagined that such an interview should take place but the opposite happened
 prasoon joshi ne fakiri kaa sawaal puch kar sawaalon ke itihaas main apana naam amar kar liya or akshay kumaar ne aam kaa sawaal puch kar canada kii naagarikta ke sawaal se bhi peechha chhudaa liya
 It has happened that the film has got quite mixed in politics and politics
 pehle aate main namak ke baraabar hoti thi lekin ab aataa hi digital kaa hota he, gehun kaa nahin
 Now you must have forgotten the Padmavat film, but there was a debate on this TV for weeks
 is bahes ke peeche makasad ek hi tha
 Villainizing minorities and putting Alauddin Khilji's face on his face who were questioning the government
 iticel ne aise tamaam logon ke chehre par allaudin khilji kaa cheharaa laga diya
 Now everyone has forgotten Padmavat
 shuruuaat se lekar 2014 ke pehle tak filmon ne jis sampradayikta ko jagah nahin di wo ab filmon main bhi, unase judi hastiyon ke jivan kaa aafitial hissaa ho gai
 The practice of wearing communalism in the name of nationalism with respect is new
 2014 ke baad sirf ek film ai mulk jo sampradayikta ke sawaal ko usee whatsap kii bhashaa main deal karti he, jis bhashaa main use failaai jaati he
 There are definitely films that appear to favor the government
 tailet ek prem katha
 The biography of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also prepared in the film
 us samaaj main jahaan mayawati ke murti banane par media ne hangaamaa kar diya lekin ab sab thik he
 Prime Minister Modi's film is ready
 autobiography or biography kaa fark mit gaya he
 Anti Pakistan's attitude has always been in films, but can someone make a film like Yash Raj Sahab Veer Zara? rajkpur hote to aaj hina bana sakate hai
 Refugee can be formed
 2016 main uri hamale ke baad sargical strike hoti he
 Uri comes as a film
 is film kaa dialog sarkaar ke mantriyon or samarthakon kaa dialog ban jaataa he
 How is the Josh climbs the Prime Minister's speech and reaches Parliament
 bajet satr main haau iz di josh kaa naaraa lagata he
 The court ordered a national anthem in cinema halls
 usee supreme adaalat ke aadesh se raashtragan dikhaane kii baadhyataa khatm kar di gai to sarkaar ko etraz nahin hua
 In the same way as on the stage of Prime Minister Modi when Nitish Kumar did not say Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata ki Jai, the Prime Minister had no objection
 jabaki ve apane bhaashanon main vande maataram na gane waalon se saavdhaan rahane ko kehete hai magar unke saamne ek bade netaa kii vande maataram nahin gaate hai to pradhanmantri nazar pher lete hai
 How can the context of Aamir Khan be forgotten
 kya us raajnneeti kaa dabaav rahaa hoga ki dangal film ke bich main raashtragan bajataa he
 Aamir Khan, who always appeared in the public space, also retreated
 jab raajnneeti filmi ho jaae or pataa na chale ki netaa film ke set par he yaa raajnneeti ke to mushkil he
 Electoral platforms are now like sets of films
 vahaan lage jimi jib camere bagaiyr kisi manmohan desai ke ishaare ke naach rahe hote hai
 When TV cameras are taking pictures of every actor of the cinema on the day of voting, then there is a need to be ashamed of their politics
 unki raajnneeti par baat karne kii zarurat he
 The cameras showed respect to the index of the film star coming out of the polling booths so much that they did not consider him less than his face or else the votes were given by the same voters
 isliye film se log jab raajnneeti main aaen to gambhirtha se lenaa chahie magar is tarah se nahin ki nishaan camel kaa he magar haath main handpump he
 Sunny Deol's film was also a border, it was built around the real story but Sunny Deol is roaming about the role of Gadar
 hema ji kii yah tasviir us samay charchit ho uthati he jab usee upi ke kisaan anaaj ke daam or sand kii maar se pareshaan whates ap par apni vyathaa ga rahe hai
 At one time, Rajiv Gandhi also used to share his friendship with Amitabh Bachchan very much in politics
 vahi amitabh bachchan raajnneeti main na jane kitnon ke dost hue
 Now Prime Minister Modi appears with more than one person
 saath aane main dikkat nahin he
 The problem is what his politics is
 jis tarah se ve ek brands ko vigyaapan karte hai usee tarah se ek netaa kaa kar dete hai
 If he is with the Prime Minister, he is also opposed to him
 prakaash raaj ne na sirf apana chunaav ladaa balki kanhaiya kaa bhi prachaar kiya
 In Tamil Nadu, Kamal Haasan is making a new choice by forming a separate party

 After this, when she gets a wicket while bowling, teasing the batsman with her own team says - You got a girl out

 10 on the morning of 25 December 2010
 30 baje sriharikota sthit isro ke mishan control centre main vaigyanikon kii saansen thami hui thim
 GSLV-F06 rocket housed the communication satellite GSAT-5P
 thik chaar minute baad 10
 The rocket was launched at 34 o'clock
 lekin, launch ke 53
 8 seconds later, people saw the rocket collapse into the sky with a bang
 logon or vaigyanikon ke chehre par maayusi chaa gai
 ISRO had a loss of about 325 crores (GSLV-F06 of 175 crores and GSAT-5P of 150 crores)
 saath hi hajaaron vaigyanikon kii maheenon kii mehnat bhi vyarth ho gai
 However, very few people know that the work of ISRO scientists is not just to launch rockets
 agar rocket disha se bhatak jaae yaa udaan ke baad usamen koi badi khami dikhaai de to use hawa main hi visphot karke dhwast karnaa bhi uski jimmedaari he
 In 2010, GSLV-F06 was also demolished in the air after its launch
 aaie aapako bataate hai us purv isro vaigyanik ke bare main jinhone is rocket ko hawa main khatm kiya tha
 So that rockets being confused by direction do not cause loss of life or property
 ISRO vaigyanikon kii chittheeh ham hairat main hai or behad dukhi bhi
 
 
 In the history of ISRO, there are only 2 cases of rocket dismantling in the air
 pehla 2006 main or doosraa 2010 main
 This rocket scientist named former President and Scientist, Bharat Ratna late Dr
 apije abdul kalam ke saath agni missile ke prakshepan main bataur sangraksha adhikari kaam kiya tha
 His name is Vinod Kumar Srivastava
 AAJTAK
 In a special conversation with IN, he told many interesting stories of his life, work, achievements and sorrows
 inhen rochak kisson ke jariye jaaniye ki kaise ek isro vaigyanik apana kaam karata he
 
 
 
 isro ke purv range sefti officer vinod kumaar shrivastav
 i had decided to demolish the rocket in 5-7 seconds
 When i was about to launch GSLV-F06, i was the Range Safety Officer at the Satish Dhawan Space Center
 meraa kaam tha rocket or range kii sefti
 Let me tell you that safety does not mean safety here
 vaigyanik ise 'sangraksha' kehete hai
 That is, avoidance of any undesirable consequences
 jieselvi-epa 06 kii lonching ke baad 47
 Everything was fine for 5 seconds
 47
 In 8 seconds we saw a disturbance in his direction
 iske baad rocket main khaamiyon kii sankhya main teji se ijapha hone laga
 He was changing direction
 rocket ke raste, sehat or khaamiyon kii sabhi jaankaree hamen second ke dasven hisse main sabase pehle milti he
 China is also amazed by the brightness of Chandrayaan-2, wants India's help in the next mission, if it falls somewhere there could have been a big loss
 isliye, maine 53
 Commanded Destruction in 8 seconds
 maine kaha- cmand agxcuted
 Then the Range Operations Director said- Roger
 iske baad vistrut report tatkaaleen isro chairman ke
 Submitted to Radhakrishnan
 puraa mishan control centre sannaate main tha
 i myself was surprised that i have to destroy the rocket
 dukh hota he aisa karne ke liye
 But, people's lives are very important for us
 kyonki hawa main jane ke baad rocket main koi badi khami hoti he to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki mishan safal nahin ho rahaa he
 Destroy him before he can harm anyone
 iske baad maine apane is kaam kii ek report banaakar isro ke alaakaman ko saunpi
 In that i told under which circumstances the rocket had to be demolished
 or sateek hogi airstrike, dushman ke haath kii ghadi tak dekh legaa bharat kaa ye satellyterocket ke raste main aane vaale sabhi ilaakon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa havinod kumaar shrivastav ne bataaya ki rocket ko chhodane se pehle uske raste kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Details of the areas under his path and the population living there are taken
 phir launch se pehle dehradun sthit neshnal hydrographic offis or dilli sthit naagarik vimaanan vibhaag ko rocket kaa rasta bataaya jaataa he
 Both these organizations inform the ship and the aircraft in the sea and air before the launch
 taaki ve surakshit tareeke se apane maarg main rahen yaa thodaa bahut badlaav kar len
 Also, information is given to the administration of the areas en route to the rocket
 jab ye donon launch se ek ghante pehle hamen kehete hai ki sab oke he, tab launch kiya jaataa he
 It is usually the effort that no city comes in the way of rocket
 lekin sriharikota se lekar andaman-nicobar tak ke oil rigs, oil tankers, jahaaj aadi padate hai

 chote parde ke sabase charchit quij shokun banegaa karodapatisijan 11 ke somvaar ke episod kii shuruyaat contestant sumit tadiyaal ke saath
 Sumit Fastest Finger First gave the fastest correct answer to the question and sat on the hot seat and proceeded in the game jokingly with Amitabh Bachchan
 wo 3 lakh 20 hajaar rupee tak ke sawaal tak khele or 6 lakh 20 hajaar rupee ke sawaal par sumit quit kar gaye

 This was the Lifeline audience poll

 sumit ne jab 3 lakh 20 hajaar rupee jite to iske baad bhi unke paas ek lifline bachi hui thi
 When he reached the question of Rs 6 lakh 40 thousand after crossing his second stop, he did not know the correct answer

 khabaron ke naam par raajnneetik dalon kaa agenda hi aaj kii patrakarita kaa satya he or aap darshakon kaa durbhaagya
 My advice to those who want to watch the news of jobs on news channels and news of loot in the name of premium OPD in hospitals
 
 They should be patient for some days unemployed and give the hospital what they want, because the channels have to fulfill the agenda of political parties
 railway pariksha kii taiyaari main lage kai chaatr kai din se news channelon se sampark karne main lage hai ki kya unki naukariyon main baari katautee kii gai he
 If the student had asked on the railway minister's tweeter handle, what would have been the right thing to know
 aap kitni bhi taiyaari kar lijie, ek netaa kaa bayaan yaa stant tivi ke screen ko le udata he
 Have told many times, am telling again
 
 
 ab vakt zyaada nahin bachaa he
 There are reports quoting sources that the Election Commission will soon give a chance to political parties and the technology experts they have chosen
 ve kisi bhi rajya main jaayen
 
 vahaan se kisi bhi booth kii ek mashin kaa chunaav karen
 He will be brought to Delhi and then hacked and show it

 aaj kal sunne main aa rahaa he ki purana itihaas mitaakar nayaa likhaa ja rahaa he
 i request that my name be written in a corner where the pages are empty, because i have first imagined Hack Swayamvar
 balki kya likhnaa he wo bhi bataa detaa hum
 In the period when the blood pressure of the news anchors had gone beyond the pressure of the atmosphere, at that time an anchor was in the imagination of the calm hack hack
 aaiye hack swayamvar kii kalpana lok main pravesh karte hai
 The hackathon will have 16 teams of technology heroes
 in dalon ke liye sabase bada sirdard yahi hoga ki kisi kaabil haikar ko manaa len jo iviem ko hack karke dikhaa de
 Now it will depend on the hacker how much he will charge from that party in return
 jo bhi iviem ko hack karke dikhaa degaa, wo bhartiya loktantr ko bachaane kaa swayamvar jeet jayega
 a garland will be put around his neck
 agar koi bina hack kiye hack swayamvar kaksh se baahar niklaa to puure desh main uske dal kaa mazaaq udega, jisaki taraf se wo hack karne haul main gaya tha
 
 
 Just as Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana serial, in the scene of Sita Swayamvar, when the king who could not lift the bow started to falter, an echo of laughter was heard in the background
