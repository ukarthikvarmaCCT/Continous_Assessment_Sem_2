 There is no dispute on its facts
 shiksha or sehat jaise maanav vikaas ke maanakon par duusare deshon kii tulana main bharat kaa pradarshan acha nahin he
 Problems come when we step into policy making and try to correct this imbalance
 aaj inklusive growth kaa bolbalaa he or iske khilaaf kam hi awaajen uthati hai
 Government will provide employment in MNREGA
 sarkaar khaadya suraksha vidheyak ke jariye chaaval, gehun or motaa anaaj degi

 ab najariya yah ban gaya he ki saste main baant dena he
 It does not even care whether BPL has been identified or not

 Recall the last years of the mid-sixties to the seventies
 kya ham bharat ke teen khoe hue vikaas dashakon kii taraf laut rahe hai? maanav vikaas ko hi len
 Generally, indicators related to social sector such as health and education are being considered as a measure of human development
 khaskar yuandipi kray shakti samanta, prati vyakti aay, shiksha (sakshartaa dar, sakal bhartee anupaat) or swasthya (ausat aayu) ke aadhaar par maanav vikaas suchakank kii gananaa karata he
 This calculation started in 1990
 chathe dashak main maanav vikaas suchakank nahin tha
 Countrywide data on human development was insufficient
 kray shakti samanta jaisi koi cheez nahin thi
 So let us look at the standard per capita income based on government exchange rates
 1960 main bharat kii prati vyakti aay 73 dollar or thailand kii 92 dollar thi
 In 2012, this income was $ 5,678 in Thailand and $ 1,492 in India
 thailand koi apwaad nahin he
 In 1960, India's position was around all the countries of East Asia including South Korea and Singapore
 aaj ham madhyam aay vaale un deshon main nahin gine jate
 In the sixties and seventies the term inclusiveness was probably not used in this way
 vishisht praavdhaan thode bhinn the lekin saidhantik or vaicharik rujhaan khaastaur par 2004 se aisa hi he
 In 1991, as finance minister, Manmohan Singh said with a slight overhaul in Victor Hugo's statement that the time for liberalization has come
 udaarikaran ko jaise bhi paribhaashit karen, uskaa arth he pratispardhaa, vikalp or kaarykushalta tathaa upyukt nigaraanee ke saath bazaar par nirbharta
 It has no conflict with the government's financial subsidy for the poor, but is in complete conflict with the monopolistic government supply
 ab ham udaarikaran ko bhulaakar sarkari dakhal ke daur main laut aae hai
 Well it would have been better if this time of thinking never comes, not even in the sixties
 acchhee sharaab umr ke saath nikharati he, lekin buree sharaab kaa sirka ban jaataa he
 It does not mean that there is support from almost all parties for government intervention
 to kya saath or sattar ke dashak main hamane bhul kii thi? aam vakil kii bhashaa main iskaa jawaab haa yaa naa ho saktaa he
 If the expected answer is yes, then we must return to see what economists and influential non-economists wrote and said at that time
 sattar ke baad se aarthik surveykshan kaa chalan he, unhen padhakar dekhie
 Supporting foolish policies is nothing more than proof of collective stupidity
 sawaal he ki sarkari dakhal main galat kya he? ek to isse akushalta aati he or akushalta vruddhi main baadhak he
 The other government already controls the resources that can be used in the private sector
 tisare sarkaar, bazaar or keemton ko gadabad kar detii he
 Fourth, there is no guarantee that government spending will be properly utilized
 65 saalon main sarkari kharch sahi dhang se hua hota to bharat garib na hota, sen or drej ko kitaab likhane ke liye koi or vishay sochna padataa
 In this sequence, some more things can go, but overall the so-called Nehruvian model has given us the gift of low growth and low income
 saadhan kam the, baantne ke liye sansaadhan kam the or hamane daulat kii bajaae garibi ko dobaaraa baant diya
 The Human Development Report shows the relationship between per capita income and indicators such as education or health
 1991 se bharat maanav vikaas suchakank main aage badha he or kam se uthakar madhyam maanav vikaas tak pahunchaa he
 This does not mean that there are no deficiencies, especially in the backward areas, but if the development process suffers, nothing will be achieved
 samasya yah he ki adhikaron or sabsidi ke liye labhaarthiyon kaa hi nahin, balki rajnatik dalon sahit lagbhag sabakaa samarthan he
 Who doesn't love free goods? Once initiated it is difficult to withdraw free assistance

 Whichever political bloc forms a government in 2014, it will be difficult to break this trap of inclusion even if it wants to

 In this desire, women use more and more makeup
 din ho yaa raat, wo apane chehre par mechap lagaati hai
 But during making up, it is very important to take care of many small things
 ek choti si chook bhi puure luk ko barbaad kar sakati he
 So while making makeup, keep in mind that the makeup should be according to the time, that is, the make-up of day and night is always different
 agar aap din ke samay zyada mechap karti hai to in baton kaa dhyaan rakhen
 This will definitely reduce some problems related to your makeup
 1
 The day camcup should not be stingy or gaudy at all
 2
 During makeup during the day, use mascara
 3
 Avoid applying dark colored shadows during the day and if you want to apply then use neutral color
 4
 It would be better to apply lipstick with gloss
 5
 Make sure that your face is completely clean before applying makeup
 toner kaa istemaal karke mechap lagane se mechap failata nahin he
 6
 bhuulakar bhidin ke samay main kiye gaye meopmen glitre kaa istemaal naa karen
 7
 dim main dhoop or garmi ke kaaran aapkaa mechap kharaab ho saktaa he
 So always use water proof beauty products only
 6
 Do not forget to apply sunscreen for 20 minutes before applying makeup
 congress mahasachiv or madhyapradesh ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ne kaha he ki bhaajapa main apni vichaardhaara ko lekar bhram kii sthiti bani hui he
 In an informal discussion with reporters, Singh said that he is saying this because the BJP is unable to decide how much Hindutva it should have in its agenda

 The Aam Aadmi Party has around 300 National Council members, while 14 are currently in the National Executive
 party main 7 vidhayak rashtriya parishad ke sadsy hai, jinhen vot karne kaa adhikaar he, jabaki anya vidhayakon ko vot karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Important decisions can be taken After the ouster of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, the party has stumbled several times

 His reference was to the sentence in the 29th line of the two-page political resolution passed in the executive, which reads, "the misconduct of women belonging to a particular class in the state and the involvement of a particular class of people in it is a coincidence or scheme
 , it's a matter of concern
 ”koi ek dashak se hindutv ke swayambhu jhandabardaar ek tajavij pesh karte rahe hai jisamen musalmaan ladakon ke ek sajeesh ke tahat hindu ladakiyon se shaadi karne ke kisse hote hai
 However, it has never been decided whether the views they present are the personal affairs of a couple or indeed they have enough strength to be called a social trend
 baharhaal, upi main pichley 12 saal se satta kaa vanvaas jhel rahi bijepi ne badi chaturaai se lav jehad ko dhruvikaran ke ek ghaatak hathiyaar ke rup main chun liya he
 In the inaugural session of the Working Committee on August 23, State BJP President Laxmikant Bajpai sounded, “this (SP) government either does not understand the sentiments of public sentiments and events or because of religious appeasement policy
 tabhi to meerut, amaniganj-faijabad, loni-gajiabad jaisi ghatnaon ke abhiyukton ke prati sarkaar naram dikhti he
 After all, why those who are guilty? Has he got a certificate of misconduct because of being a special religion? " Apparently, ahead of next month's by-election for the 11 seats of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, the BJP opposed Lav Jihad and gave vent to the plans of Hinduist organizations
 bajpeyi kehete bhi hai, “ladakiyon ko bahalane-phuslane ke khilaaf janamat jaagran hoga” (dekhen intervyuu)
 But did Bajpayee and the state BJP leaders only succeed in bringing the new genie out of the bottle on their own or do they have the support of the party central leadership? You have to go back a little bit for this
 baat 19 agast kii he
 On that day Amit Shah reached Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, his victory land for the first time after becoming the national president of BJP

 Shah was not just laden with garlands, but as a special strategy, Shah was offered offerings from Ayodhya, Mathura, Kashi and Vindhyachal and Saropa from the Sikh community
 manch se apane sambodhan main amit shah ne sapa sarkaar par ek vishesh varg ke tushtikaran kaa aarope lagaaya
 He indicated that the time has come to throw light into the tried ammo of Hindutva and polarization

 Before the meeting started, the BJP distributed leaflets to all members regarding the incidents of riots, atrocities and Muslim appeasement after the formation of SP government in the state
 hindutv agenda ko dhar dene ke liye bijepi ne netaaon ko sampradayik takaraav main peedit hinduon ko kanoonee se lekar har tarah kii madad karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 All these incidents are quite similar to the rituals that took place 22 years before the Babri Masjid was demolished
 lakhanu vishvavidhyalay main arabi-farsi vibhaag ke purv vibhaagadhyaksh pro
 Says Khan Atif, “the BJP cleverly put Hindus and Muslims face to face before the Lok Sabha elections
 party isi maahaul ko vidhansabha chunaav tak barkaraar rakhana chaahati he
 The sp's inability to stop the riots and atrocities of women and the inaction of the BSP have made room for the bjp's agenda
 ”aise maahaul main kaarysmiti main maujuud party ke fire brands netaa vinay katiyaar ne apane vibhaajak andaaj main lav jehad ke virudgh sangharsh kaa elaan kar daalaa
 Katiyar says, “love Jihad is going on all over the state

 The state government will have to bear its serious consequences

 Ramesh Dixit says that the BJP in UP is going through the same situation as it was in the early nineties
 “ram mandir andolan ke dauraan varsh 1991 main bijepi ne upi main purna bahumat kii sarkaar banaai
 Though the BJP won 177 and 174 seats respectively in the 1993 and 1996 assembly elections after the Babri Masjid demolition, the absence of an emotional issue and mismanagement at the grassroots level in the organization led the party's grassroots to move to other parties
 ”ab bijepi yah nahin chaahati, isiilie hindu sanghathan band-baaja lekar gade murdon se lekar nae muddon tak kii baraat nikaalane par amada hai

 We will activate social organizations working in the street through our activists against the seduction and deception of girls by a class
 janamat jaagran or kanoon ke daayre main rahakar dharna-pradarshan kii ranneeti bhi ban rahi he
 Why did Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh abruptly cancel the program of joining the Working Committee? Did these big leaders want to avoid issues like alleged love jihad? After the by-election was announced suddenly, the national president Amit Shah became very busy with the work of the organization
 baadh or north-east kii samasya ke chalate rajnath singh kaarysmiti kii baithak main nahin aa sake
 Many party leaders are directly making offensive statements against the alleged Love Jihad? This is the personal opinion of those leaders who are being misrepresented
 ek vishesh varg dwaara ladakiyon ko bahala-phusalaakar unka shoshan karne kii ghatnaayen lagaataar saamne aa rahi hai
 In fact, after the formation of SP government in UP, cases of systematic atrocities on girls have increased rapidly
 party netaa shuruyaat se iskaa virodh kar rahe hai lekin ab unke virodh ko lav jehad ke khilaaf sangharsh bataaya ja rahaa he jo ki galat he
 Is the BJP exploring the possibility of polarization through this by raising issues like alleged love jihad before the by-elections? Incidents like seduction of girls, exploiting them by deception have increased due to the policy of appeasement of a section of the SP government of the state 
 dangon kaa bhi yahi kaaran he
 The government should clear its position in it

 On 2 May, Devendra Fadnavis was shocked to learn that the Shiv Sena had brought Srinivas Vanga, son of late BJP MP Chintaman Vanga, into his court

 '' shivasena ke saansad sanjay raut ne bhaajapa par tanj kasate hue 'jo jaisaa bota he, vaisaa katata he' kaa muhaavara diya

 bhandara-gondia ke upachunaav main bhi ladaai mushkil dikh rahi he, jahaan congress or ensipi saath aa gaye hai
 Here NCP has fielded Madhukar Kukade against bjp's Deepak Patale

 Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan and his wife Kareena Kapoor had decided before the wedding that after marriage, the two would not give kissing scenes with their co-star in any film
 par ye zyada din tik nahin paaya
 Kareena Kapoor gave the kissing scene with Kangana Ranot in 'ki & Ka' and Saif in 'rangoon' with Arjun Kapoor
 darasal saf or karina ne apni ye deal beti ke kehane par todi
 Sara and Harshvardhan, who were seen together at kareena-saif's dinner party, interviewed a talk show, Kareena said that Sara had suggested to Kareena and Saif that there should be no such deal in the wedding
 sara ne donon ko ye bhi samajhaayaa ki jaise filmon main baaki seen hote hai, vaise hi kising seen bhi hote hai
 Kareena's daughter is dating Shahid's brother! Let me tell you that earlier in an episode of Koffee with Karan in 2010, when Karan asked Kareena how it feels to date a person before whom Have two children? So Bebo had said, 'we have been talked about this many times
 main ise ek jimmedaari ke taur par nahin leti kyonki bacchon ke paas pehle se maa he
 But yes children will need friends
 sara or main jab bhi saath main baithte hai, to sefu kehete the, ham donon unke bachche hai
 'significantly, Sara will soon make her Bollywood debut with Dharma Productions
 haalanki abhi tak is baat kii adhikarik ghoshnaa nahin hui he ki ye film kis vishay par aadhaarit hogi
 Recently, there was news that Sara may soon debut with Salman Khan's sister Arpita's husband Ayush

 The wedding day is very special for every girl
 aamtaur par sabhi yahi sochate hai ki is vakt ladki kaa sara dhyaan sajane par hoga yaa phir vah man hi man honeymoon kii planning kar rahi hogi
 but it's not like that
 balki shaadi ke din jo baaten yaa sawaal ladakiyon ke dimag main chal rahe hote hai, unka pataa agar duulhe ko yaa uske parivaar waalon ko chal jaae, to rishta tut bhi saktaa he
 1
 kahin main bahut jaldi to shaadi nahin kar rahi?yah sawaal har ladki shaadi ke samay apneaap se puuchhati he or is maukey par lagbhag sabhi ko yahi lagata he ki uski shaadi jaldi ho rahi he
 The simple answer to this is that if you feel that you are capable of performing the responsibilities then your age is right for marriage
 shant dimag or positive soch ke saath aage badhen or apane rishte ko nibhaane ke liye puri tarah taiyaar rahen
 2
 kya main us ghar jaakar aaraam se rah paaungi?yah sawaal ladakiyon ko bahut adhik daraata he
 She always feels that whether she will be able to live comfortably in the new house or not, the people there will take her and whether she will adopt them or not
 iskaa koi likhit pramaan to nahin diya ja saktaa he lekin itnaa jarur he ki agar koshish karengi or khud ko aisi paristhiti ke liye taiyaar rakhengi to yah sambhav hona koi mushkil baat nahin
 Go ahead by accepting change and do not bring negative feelings in mind
 3
 Will his family like me? This question is less and more worrying
 shaadi se pehle aap chahen jitani bhi baar ladke ke parivaar waalon se mil len, shaadi ke din yah khyaal aana to tay he
 Till the wedding day and for a long time after that, every girl thinks whether the people of this new family will adopt her or not
 khaastaur par ladke kii maa
 But it depends on you completely how you get on with them
 4
 Was there a need to spend so much in marriage? This is a question that no one other than you can answer
 shaadi ke din tak ladkiyaan sochati hai ki kya unhen apane kapadon, gahanon or mechap par itnaa kharch karne kii jarurat thi
 However, she herself gives the answer that marriage happens only once, so everything should be good
 5
 Will we be together for life? Will we be together for life? a question that every woman is under stress
 iskaa jawaab aapaki sooyeeboojh main hi chipa hua he
 If you will pursue your married life with honesty then it will surely go on with life
 lekin nijee maamalon ko sulajhane ke liye kisi tisare ko bich main laane se samasyaayein ho sakati hai
 However, experts consider such ideas coming in the mind of girls as natural
 darasal, shaadi ke baad ladki ke jivan main sambandhon or reeti-rivaajon ko lekar jis tarah ke badlaav aate hai, use lekar ve duvidha main aa sakati hai or vakt ke saath yah sab thik bhi ho jaataa he

 a unique thing in the discussion about the elections in the 70 km stretch from Mangaluru to Manipal is that people here are considering Siddaramaiah as the face of Prime Minister Modi
 bhaajapa ke siem pad ke ummidavaar or purv mukhyamantri yeddiurppa or congress adhyksh rahul gandhi chunavi mukaable kii charchaa se baahar hai
 Modi and Siddaramaiah are being named instead of BJP or Congress party in the cross-examination of achievements and failures

 When this issue comes up in the discussion, people themselves start saying that Modi will be bitten by this political bet

 But Congress representatives are considering Siddaramaiah in place of Rahul Gandhi

 vampanthi partiyon ko tisare morche ke rup main ek aisa mauka mila he jiske jariye ve congress ke netritv vaali sarkaar kaa samarthan karne se batch sakati hai

 But this time if the Third Front comes to power, they will be under pressure to decide whether to join the government or not
 party kii bengal ikai pradhanmantri pad ke liye buddhadev bhattacharya ke naam par jor de sakati he or karaat ke saath surajeet vaali haalat ho sakati he
 Such scenarios reflect the dwindling grip of perceived national parties and the increasing power of provincial leaders

 The Prime Minister himself has targeted many states by holding regional parties responsible for the backwardness of them
 unhone kaha ki achche shashan ke liye ek 'rashtriya nazariye' vaali party kii jarurat he
 This comment of the Prime Minister can be said to be bitter in view that his UPA government was based on the crutches of the regional parties
 vam morche ne jab sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya tha tab ek anya kshetreey party (sapa) use bachaane ke liye saamne aa gai thi
 The Congress's own failures are also to some extent responsible for the split in the UPA

 The Congress, which performed better in the southern states last time, may have to bear the displeasure of the people towards the central government this time

 unka maananaa he ki unke satta main aane ke baad teesraa morcha khud apane boj tale charmara jayega-1977-80 ke janata prayog kii tarah
 Supporters of the Third Front can argue that the governments of Vishwanath Pratap Singh (1989–90), Deve Gowda (1996–97) and Inder Gujral (1997–98) were either toppled by the BJP or the Congress
 lekin ve yah bhul jate hai ki ye sarkarein congress yaa bhaajapa yaa donon ke samarthan se bani thim
 Indeed, regional parties are seeking to benefit from the 'battle of bali-sugriva'
 mamata commeredon ke saath satta main bhagidaari nahin kar saktin; mulaayam mayawati ko phooti ankhon nahin dekh sakate; jayalalita or karunanidhi aapas main haath nahin mila sakate
 Due to such competition many regional parties may stick to the Third Front to avoid their arch enemy
 agar mulaayam singh yadav congress kaa saath dete hai to mayawati un donon se dur rahengi
 Nonetheless, pre-election equations may change a lot after May 16, in which opportunism can play an important role
 teesraa morcha kisi vichaardhaara yaa saajha nunatam kaarykram par aadhaarit nahin he, isliye har cheez satta ke bantwaare kii sharton par nirbhar karegi
 What will be their economic policy? Or what will be their priorities in foreign policy? No one has the answer to these questions yet, although we know that not all of them agree with the views of Comrade Karat

 Director Umesh Kharge's direction is weak, as its comic scenes are not laughable
 film main koi kahani nahin he sivaae duusari filmon ke majaak udaane ke
 There is a very weak screenplay and there are scenes and dialogues full of sex, those too, which seem very clumsy

 england main hui test siries main jab team india ko sharmnaak haar mili, to iskaa postmortem hona laazmi tha
 The BCCI blamed the cricketers' wives and girlfriends for the loss
 chaliye ek baar ko maan lete hai ki patniyon or garlfrends kii maujuudagi se khilaadiyon kaa dhyaan bhang hua
 But can Team India's cricketers drip catches on the field, captain Cool MS Dhoni's captaincy and lack of strategy, top order batsmen fail badly, and coaching staff failures be ignored? Read: 'wives, girlfriends Le Dink team India knows what the BCCI wants to prove by losing the loss on the wives and girlfriends of the cricketers
 lekin is baat ko jhuthlaayaa nahin ja saktaa ki bharat ne apni hi galatiyon kii vajah se sharmnaak tareeke se siries 1-3 se ganvaa di
 We are the losers even before, but this defeat also shocked the BCCI, including the cricket fans
 is baar cricketron kii patniyon or garlfrends kaa mudda isliye bhi surkhiyaan bator rahaa he, kyonki khabaren ai ki bisisiai ne viraat kohli ko apni garlfriend or bollywood actress anoushka sharma ko saath le jane kii anumati de di
 If this Virat would have walked in the series, then this would not have created much controversy, but Virat failed badly
 viraat 10 pariyon main 134 ran hi bana sake or twitor se lekar fasebuk tak majaak kaa paatr banakar rah gaye
 Cricketers 'form, fitness, bench strength, coach staff's failure, captain's wrong decisions, irresponsible dismissals of batsmen must be discussed before blaming players' wives and girlfriends
 england or australia ke cricketer bhi lambey videshi dauron par apni patniyon or garlfrends ke saath aate hai
 However, the ECB and CA make a slot for wives and girlfriends to live with cricketers
 isse lambey dauron par cricketer ko unki patni / garlfriend kaa saath bhi mil jaataa he or isse unka dhyaan bhi bhang nahin hota
 We have already got our nose cut in the Test series, and if we ignore the real issues in the post-mortem of defeat, then the ODI and T20 will also be troubled
 agar team ko vaapasi kerani he to ye kuch aise mudde hai, jin par kaam karnaa hoga
 The 1-batsman kept making similar mistakes continuously and the coaching staff failed to improve it completely
 top order ke ballebaajon ko test siries main apni galatiyon se sikh lete hue technic par dhyaan dena chahie
 It is the responsibility of the coaching staff to tell the batsmen their shortcomings and also improve them
 2-nets practice ko team india or gambhirtha se le
 Captain Dhoni was not seen in the practice session before the last Test of the series despite losing the fourth Test
 3-fielding main sudhaar team india kii sabase badi jaruraton main shumaar he
 The way players are dropping catches in slip, it seems that they have forgotten to take the catch
 aasaan se aasaan kaich bhi team india ke dhurandharon ne tapakaaya or jiske chalate bharat ne match ganvaaya
 If the team will overcome these shortcomings, then believe that the issue of wives and girlfriends of cricket fans and media cricketers will be forgotten
 bhartiya cricket phans aise hi hai, agar team jite to cricketron ko bhagwaan bana dete hai or vahi team haare to use kahin kaa nahin chhodte

 There is no provision of special teacher special in the school for them, whereas on 16 September 2009, a double bench of the High Court, in its order, ordered special teachers to be placed in schools
 hai court ne is maamle main dilli sarkaar oresadmasiko notice jari kar do saptaah main jawaab maanga he
 There are around 1600 posts of special teachers in MCD schools, but so far only 170 special teachers have been kept
 jabaki, dilli sarkaar ke skulon me kareeb 400 special teachers hai, jabaki 933 post special teachers ke liye hai
 The court has asked that the government and SDMC tell how many mentally challenged children study in their schools and how many special teachers have been appointed so far? It has also asked what steps they have taken to implement the order of the High Court given in September 2009
 In its order in 2009, the High Court said that two special teachers should be appointed in every school
 is vaqt dilli sarkaar or nigam ke skulon main lagbhag tees hajaar veikshipt chaatr pard rahe hai
 The court, hearing the petition filed on behalf of the families of two mentally challenged children, was also angry with the Delhi government and the corporation in this case because even after 7 years, the court order was not followed
 mumkin he ki agali sunwaayee par court donon ke khilaaf avmaananaa kii karwaai bhi kare
 The case will be heard on 25 October

 There can be no dispute over the need for research on these animals, but the large complexes and centers with additional facilities like guest houses are not being given resource requirements
 ek varisht vaigyanik ne kaha, ''jab hamaare yahaan rajyon ke krishi vishvavidhyalay hai hi to itane saare pashu anusandhan kendron kii jarurat kya he? adarsh taur par to bhartiya krishi anusandhan parishad (isiaar) kii aarthik madad se vishvavidhyalayon ko hi is tarah kaa research karnaa chahie
 “india's research network is one of the most comprehensive in the world
 yahaan vibhinn parishadon ke paas bahut saare sansthaanon kii puri aisi ladi he jahaan vaigyanik mitti se lekar antariksh tak ke vishyon par research karte hai
 But taking a deeper look at these shows that there is a lot of unusable work, repetition i
e
 the same kind of work is done in many institutions and there is no mutual coordination between different agencies

 ek krishi vaigyanik ne bataaya, ''inamen se kai tathakthith anusandhan centre rajnatik vajahon se sthapit kiye gaye hai, isliye unhen band karnaa kathin he
 ICAR is also looking trapped in a turn of time
 aazaadee ke pehle yaa uske thik baad sthapit kiye gaye santhaan ab bhi usee lakshya ke saath kaam karte dikh rahe hai
 For example, the Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute (IASRI) in New Delhi was established in 1930 as a statistical unit of the Council
 iske baad ke varshon main yah 300 se zyada karmchaariyon vaala baari-bharkam santhaan ban gaya
 It also has another institute called the National Center for Agricultural Economics and Policy Research (NCAP)
 2002 main ek sarkari samiti ne suzav diya tha ki ieearai or ensiapi kaa ek-duusare main vilay kar diya janaa chahie
 But nothing has been implemented on these suggestions and these two institutions are still achieving separate identity and budget

 After all, what should be done in the budget so that the impression of 'namo Namo' can be seen in it? When people voted for Modi ji, not BJP
 jab rail bajet prabhu kii marji se nahin, modi ji ke manamafik bana
 Then how can the general budget be such that Namo Kripa is not seen
 baaki chijen to wo tay kar hi chuke the
 Which things are cheaper in the budget and which are expensive? The matter was stuck on this
 phir unhone team modi kii madad lene kaa faisla kiya
 a suggestion came from Team Modi that suits named after Modi should be made cheap
 modi suut kii karodon main nilaamee ke baad kaaphi log vaise kot banvaanaa chaah rahe hai, lekin mahangaa hone ke kaaran hichak rahe hai
 This information was given to Team Modi by a tailor from Gujarat who stitched Modi's clothes
 isi tarah ek idia modi kurte ko lekar tha
 There was also an idea about Modi jacket
 is fehrist main ek dhansu idia to aisa tha ki jetali sahab kaa sar hi gum gaya
 The idea was to make the charter plane journey cheaper by subsidizing the budget
 saath main logic bhi tha ki isse madhya varg main kharidne kii hode machegi
 Just like people buy cars and scooties by taking loans, similarly if they get the chance, they will start buying charter planes
 aakhir log mobile kharid rahe hai ki nahin
 These are not the same people who did not get landlines because they would have to pay bills every month
 charter plane vaale idia se chautarafa phayda hone kii baat samajhaaii gai thi
 If foreign companies show little interest, then Make in India will also work
 is tarah agar saste charter plane banane lage to export kar bharat kam se kam is field main leader to ban hi saktaa he
 There were thousands of such computer generated ideas
 jetali sahab ko lag rahaa tha unhone kulhadi par hi pair maar diya he
 He regrets why he sought advice from that high tech team
 asal main team modi kaa system ye he ki uske kisi bhi idia ko riject karte vakt logical vajah bataani padati he
 If the team member objected after rejecting the idea, then Modi had to appear before him and give clarification
 marataa kya na kartadilli chunaavon kii vajah se jetali sahab ke paas vakt bahut kam bachaa tha
 Understanding the idea of reading one of the above and rejecting it with reason was new
 hua vahi jisaki jetali sahab ko ashanka thi
 Jaitley saheb appeared before Modi
 khayr, peshi to jetali sahab ke peshey kaa hissaa he
 He had also found his point
 modi ke darbar main argument kii bahut gunjaaish to hoti nahin
 In a few words, the point has to be made
 baat bade or vakt barbaad ho isse pehle hi jetali sahab ne apni baat kah di, 'sar, har sajaa manjuur he
 Just present the budget
 kyonki philhal or koi chaara bhi nahin he
 Just a request
 ''wo kya?' modi ji bole
 'sir, please suggest an idea
 vakt bahut kam he
 Three will also work
 dekh lenge
 'jaitley saheb knew that triplets always come in the mind of Modi ji
 single idia to beete dinon kii baat ho gai
 Have to agree
 nasibavaalon kaa bhi har din ek sa nahin hota
 This was the first time that Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not think of any idea
 bole, 'aaj thodaa thakaa hum

 According to research, if you limit the daily sitting time to a maximum of three hours per day, then your ability to live can increase by two years
 isi tarah yadi aap rojaanaa tivi dekhne kii avadhi ko bhi do ghante se kam main simit kar len to aapkaa jivan 1
 May extend to 4 years
 pehle bhi kai adhyayanon main pataa chalaa he ki adhik samay tak baithe rahane yaa tivi dekhne se swasthya kharaab hota he or madhumeh or hriday rog tathaa dil kaa daura padane ke kaaran akasmaat marane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 According to a report by the online research journal BMJ Open, the researchers used data collected in 2005-06 and 2009-10 for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for analysis
 ye aankade yah jaanane ke liye jutaaye gaye the ki america vayask kitna samay tak baithkar bitaate hai or kitna samay tak tivi dekhte hai

 byaap par bijli mil to jaati he lekin itani mahangi ki balb jalaane main bhi dar lagata he
 The best option to overcome this fear is solar energy
 aap soch rahe honge ki solar panel lagane ke liye to kaaphi jagah kii jarurat hogi or aaj ke samay main jagah kii hi to sabase zyada kami he
 But now there is no need to panic
 aap chahen to gamale ke sies main bhi solar panel laga sakate hai
 Or you can grow a solar tree
 dedh foot ke gamale main aap ye solar tree aasaani se uga sakate hai
 Science and Technology Minister Dr
 Harsh Vardhan said that this technology could be developed only due to the untiring efforts of scientists of Council of Industrial Research and CMERI
 vaigyanik doctor es maiti kii aguai main vaigyanikon kii ek team ne is solar tree ko banaaya he
 With this help, more and more energy can be obtained in less space
 kolkata ke do yuvakon ne ye takanic sarkaar se hasil kii or iskaa vyavsaayik utpaadan shuru kiya
 Under Start Up India and Digital India, vibes solar solution india LLP has also designed cheap solar products to make solar energy easily available to village towns and cities
 yun to solar panel lagane ke liye kaaphi jagah chahie hoti lekin is takneekee kii madad se aap kam jagah main zyada energy praapt kar sakate hai
 These are the reasons why more energy is available in less space: - Typically, an SPV (solar photo voatic) plate of conventional solar energy requires 100-125 square feet of land per kilo watt
 itani jameen kii keemat karodon rupee hoti he
 While this solar plant 1
 5X1
 Can be fitted in a space of 5 feet only
 -paaramparik solar park main ek kilowat urja ke liye plate lagane kii laagat 75 se 80 hajaar rupee aati he
 Although the cost of solar tree comes from about one lakh fifteen thousand to one and a quarter lakh rupees, it should not be forgotten that this saves land worth crores of rupees
 jise duusare kaamon ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 -it is very easy to maintain
 ise banane waalon ne is ped ke mul tane par ek fawwara bhi lagaaya he
 When attached to the water pipe, the sprayers also clean all the plates
 philhal, sarkaar in solar tries kii shrinkhalaa ko desh kii nadiyon ke ghaaton par lagane kii yojana bana rahi he
 So that solar energy can illuminate the ghats
 iske alaava is urja se motor boat bhi chalaai ja sakati hai
 When this happens, the motor boat owners will be very comfortable and they will be able to charge their motor boat anytime
 is solar panel ke rakh-rakhaav ke liye ek kit he jisase ye puri tarah surakshit rahegi
 a detailed project report is being prepared on this entire project
 aane vaale samay main vigyaan or takneekee mantralay ke baad jaldi hi kai sarkari, piesu or nijee korporate offison ke alaava skool, college or residential societes is solar tree se jagamagaayenge
 This will also greatly benefit the environment
 CSIR or CMERI kii is saajha viksit takanic ke vyavsaayik utpaadak amit narsariya kaa daawa he ki ye puri tarah se desi takanic he
 This is the first use of this variety in the world in which solar plates are installed like trees

 On his birthday, let's see the trailer of his Marathi film 'baji', which is going to be released on February 6, 2015: Trailer of Marathi film 'baji': sena kaa prayaas, javaanon ko mili viklaangata pension kaa laabhpension paane ke liye cmand aspataalon main karana hoga medicalsashastr balon neviklaangata pensionka daawa karne vaale javaanon kii chikitsa samasyaon kaa akalan karne ke liye ek jaanch kii vyavastha kii he
 Earlier, it was decided to tax it due to misuse of disability pension by senior officials
 sena yah sunishchit karne kaa prayaas kar rahi he ki viklaangata pension kaa laabh javaanon or junior kamishand adhikariyon ko bhi mili
 What is the whole matter? Lt
 General Ashwini Kumar, the outgoing Army General, said on 31 October, a day before his retirement, 'there were some cases in which serious irregularities were found in the creation of medical profiles
 is par sangyaan liya gaya or logon ko dandit kiya gaya
 'the Army has created a system where Major General and above officers will have to get their medical done only in command hospitals to get disability pension

 Soon it will be extended to the Brigadier and its benefits will also be strengthened
 iske alaava yah bhi prastaav he ki viklaangata pension par tex lagane ke nirnay ko aanshik rup se waapas le liya jaae
 The government had decided to impose tax on pension
 Earlier, the government had decided to tax disability pension for those who served till the end of their tenure, but were exempt from tax for those who were given retirement due to disability
 
 kuch logon ko lagata he ki yah praavdhaan un logon ko dandit karne jaisaa he, jo yuddh ke samay viklang ho gaye or iske baavjood apane kaarykaal main bahut baad tak sevaayen dete rahe
 In its circular issued on June 24, 2019, the Ministry of Finance has sought clarification by raising the question whether as per the provision of Income Tax Act, 1922, the benefit of tax-free disability pension is limited to only those who are disqualified and retired or Then it also includes those people who retired after completing their tenure despite wiggling
 circular aage kahata he ki is maamle kii jaanch kii gai
 The original notification of March 21, 1922 states that income tax exemption will be only for those who were disqualified from service due to disability
 is praavdhaan ke aadhaar par yah faisla liya gaya he
 Although, many posted officials feel that the disability pension was misused by some senior officials, it does not mean that it should be abolished altogether

 Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted that the Supreme Court's order to nullify the whip and expand the tenth list of the Constitution set a bad judicial precedent
 unhone kaha ki vidhayakon ko jis tarah kaa purna sangrakshan diya gaya he vah pehle kabhi nahin suna gaya
 He wondered whether the order meant that the court could interfere with the functioning of the state assembly by deciding when the whip would be implemented
 surajevaala ne kaha, "dukhad he ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne pichley paanch varshon main modi sarkaar dwaara loktantric janadeshon ko palatney ke liye dalbadal ke abhikalpit itihaas or sandarbh ko nahin samajha
 He requested the Supreme Court to recall his May 2016 order to nullify the bjp's illegal attempt to form the government in Uttarakhand

 The bench said that there should not be any restriction on the direction or comments of the judiciary on the Speaker's prerogative to decide on the resignations of 15 mlas and he should be free to take a decision on the subject
 iske saath hi nyaayalay ne kaha ki vidhansabha adhyaksh ke faisle ko uske samaksh pesh kiya jaye
 The court said that all the other issues raised in this case will be decided later
 (input-agency) In the Commonwealth Games in the last 10 days, it seemed like gold had rained
 101 medal ke saath bhartiya khiladiyon ne wo karnama kar dikhaaya, jise kaamanwealth kaa itihaas yaad rakhega
 But when this balloon of pride is left, will every Indian's tongue be heard saying, 'all the good from the world, Hindustan Hamara

 But there was less salt in the joy of this victory
 aisa koi din nahin gujara, jahaan benaam or gumnaam chehron ne har bharatiyon kaa sar ooncha nahin kiya
 Millions of people on television and thousands of people sitting in the stadium felt a sense of pride when an Indian standing in the middle of the center saw a ribbon of medals in his neck
 lekin phir bhi bahut-kuch adhuraa rahaa
 We still maintain the title of our British era

 Do not forget that three snakes were caught in the Games Village and the whole world saw it on television
 toote tilon ne jimnast ke pairon ko jakhmi kiya, swimming pool main tairaakon ko infections hua, to dhavakon ko kharaab trek kii vajah se apana practice seshan chhodana padaa
 Australian TV, British and New Zealand newspapers flirted with our Commonwealth Games, while many TV commentators mocked our leaders
 halaat itane bigade ki hamaare videsh mantralay ko kai videshi rajdooton ko jhidki tak bhejni padi
 The extent was reached when the number of foreign tourists was even lower this year than the average octubers

 We seemed to be making an impression at the international level
 lekin aaj 1984 se lekar ab tak aarthik taur par ham chauguna zyada shaktishaalee hai
 Our population is more than double and at the international level we think of the world as equal to China
 lekin kya yah sach he?dimak lage bhartiya pranali ne chautarafa bhrashtachar or sangdili ne aaj bhartiya garima ko aisi chot pahunchaai he ki kahin na kahin ham sabon kaa sar shame se jhuk jaataa he
 After October 14, when political parties take to the streets for niggling, demand a CBI inquiry and try to know where the Indian government and Delhi government together spent 77 thousand crores rupees, then for 10-15 days all of us will be on television
 But we will show such reports and write in newspapers, but then the same will happen every time
 ham bhul jaaenge
 We will forget whether Suresh Kalmadi is guilty after 15 years of CBI investigation? How much did the Olympic Union embezzle? How much theft was done by the Delhi government
 
 
 or emsidi ne kitna kuch parde ke peeche chupa diya?ham aisa isliye nahin karenge kyonki yah hamaara pesha nahin he or isaki kasak hamen mahasoos nahin hogi
 We speak because culturally and conventionally, Indians have a habit of forgetting and forgiving
 ham bachapan se yah sikhte aae hai ki jo galat karata he, use maaf kar do,
 
 
 Because he who forgives is greater
 
 
 
 And in the race to make ourselves bigger, we sacrifice the pride of our country as well

 Initially Kapil's show is getting mixed response
 iske saath hi kapil kii fees kii charchaa he
 It is being told that this time they are working in very low fees
 ek daily news paper ke anusaar, kapil sharma ne is baar apane sho ke liye fees gata di he
 Earlier, Kapil used to charge Rs 60 to 70 lakhs for an episode, while now he is charging Rs 15 to 20 lakhs
 report main yah bhi bataaya gaya ki kapil ke nae ko-star krishna abhishek or bharti singh, jinaki kaaphi acchhee fain folowing he, ek weekend episod kii fees 10 se 12 lakh rupye le rahe hai

 On the other hand, Sunil Grover's show is not very much discussed
 haalanki uskaa formet bhi lagbhag vaisaa hi jaise tivi ke tamaam kamedi shoj kaa rahata he
 So should Sunil Grover make a big mistake by not coming with Kapil despite having a chance? Sunil Grover made a big mistake by not coming with Kapil Sharma? Has lost its stardom
 kuch vivaad bhi unki chhavi ko batta lagane vaale sabit hue
 But it is not that Kapil alone had to suffer the brunt of separation
 gaur se dekhen to algaav ke baad sunil ke saath bhi lagbhag vahi sab hua jo kapil ne bhugta
 However, there were no more controversies with Sunil than Kapil and his professional commitment is an example
 agar aap chaahate hai ki aapke bachche ganit ke dhani hon to unhen khilne kaa samay jarur den
 Researchers have known that fitness leads to the development of brain structure that enhances skills over mathematics and contributes to the associated achievements
 shodh darshata he ki jo bachche aerobikali feet hai, unke mastishk main koshikaon kii sabase bahari parat cerebram (grey meter) bahut hi patali hoti he jo ganit ke behatar pradarshan kaa ek mukhya kaarak hoti he
 Laura chaddok-heyman, lead researcher at the University of Illinois at the United States, said, "the thinning of gray matter is a fully formed healthy brain form
" iskaa matlab he ki mastishk anaavashyak samparko ko samaapt kar aavashyak samparko ko majboot karata he
 ' shodhakartaaon ne 9 or 10 saal ke 48 bacchon par adhyayan kiya
 All these children underwent fitness tests on the treadmill
 in sabhi main aadhe bachche aerobics fitness ke liye 70 pratishat tak feet the or aadhe bachche 30 pratishat tak feet the
 The comments shodhakartaaon ne emarai kaa upyog kar bacchon ke ganit, padhane or vartanee ke kaushal kaa pareekshan kar unke mastishtak ko jaancha
 Up to 70 percent of the fit for aerobic fitness was consistent with better math performance in children with gray mater being more thin
 yah adhyayan 'plos van' patrika main prakashit kiya gaya he
 Research shows that children who are aerobically fit have a very thin cerebrum (gray mater), the outermost layer of cells in their brain, which is a key factor in better math performance
 america main ilinoy uniwarsity main pramukh shodhakarta laura chaddoke-heman ne kaha, 'grey matter kaa patala hona purna rup se gathit swasthy mastishk kaa rup he
 This means that the brain strengthens the necessary connections by eliminating unnecessary contacts

 This will be the first time in the history of seventy years when women will be left behind in men voter turnout in Lok Sabha elections
 pehle or duusare charan ke matdaan se yah shuruyaat ho chuki he
 Although the representation of women as a candidate is low, but women have surpassed men in voting turnout
 chunaav ayog ne do charnon ke matdaan ke trend kaa aadhikarik aankada jari kar diya he
 In the first phase, the turnout of women is half per cent higher, while in the second phase this increase is 0
 14 fisadi kii he
 This slight increase in voting turnout is a sign of a major change in democracy with political initiatives
 chunaav ayog ke aankadon kii padtaal ke baad india today kii data intelligence unit ne paaya ki pehle charan main yani 11 april ko hue loksabhaa chunaav main uttararakhand kii mahilaon kaa turnout purushon se paanch fisadi zyada rahaa jabaki duusare number par meghalaya rahaa
 4 women turnout in Meghalaya
 67 fisadi zyada rahaa
 Voting turnout of women in first phase 68
 53 fisadi darj kiya gaya jabaki isi charan main purushon kaa voter turnout 68
 It was 02 percent
 duusare charan main bhi takreeban yahi sthiti darj kii gai
 The second phase of April 18 elections in 12 states shows that the turnout of women in these states is 69
 21fisadi record kiya gaya, jabaki purushon kaa voter turnout 69
 07 percent was recorded
 bihar main mahilaon ne voting ke maamle main purushon se zyada ruchi dikhaai
 In the first phase of elections held in four districts of Bihar, turnout of women was one per cent more than men
 pehle charan ke atharah rajyon or centreshasit pradesh main se kareeb aadhe main mahilaon kaa turnout purushon se zyada rahaa
 However, in states like Maharashtra, Jammu Kashmir, Chhattisgarh, men were still ahead in voting turnout
 duusare charan ke liye 12 rajyon main hue matdaan main mahilaon ne purushon ke mukaable zyada voting kii
 In this phase, women of Bihar were at the forefront
 bihar main duusare charan kii voting main mahilaayein purushon se kareeb chah fisadi zyada voting kii hai
 Manipur is second in terms of high turnout of women voting where the turnout of women is more than four per cent of men
 urisa main yah antraral do fisadi se zyada he
 Like the first phase, states like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Jammu and Kashmir lagged behind women voting turnout in the second phase
 kya hota he voting turnout:voter list main jitne logon kaa naam darj he usamen se kitne logon ne vot kiya
 This ratio is called voting turnout
 voting turnout main mahilaon ke aage nikalne ke matlab he jitani mahilaayein or purush voting list main the, donon main se kisne apni sankhya ke hisaab se zyada vot kiya
 Currently, there are five rounds of voting in the election for 543 seats
 pichley loksabhaa ke trend ko dekhen to mahilaon or purushon kaa voting turnout ke bich kaa antar dhire-dhire kam hua he lekin shuruaati rujhaanon se lagata he ki 2019 ke lok sabha chunaav main mahilaayein voting turnout ke maamle main purushon ko peeche chhod dengi
