 Has issued a statement of demand
 dilli ke mukhyamantri or 'aap' supremeo arvind kejariwal ne loksabhaa chunaavon kaa bigul phoonk diya he
 The capital has 7 Lok Sabha seats under Kejriwal's target
 iske liye unhone dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaane kaa andolan ched diya he
 The movement suits Kejriwal's politics
 2013 main jab unhone pehali baar dilli main chunaav ladaa to lokapal ko mudda banaaya or iske dam par unako satta hasil hui
 In 2015 too, he won public confidence in the Lokpal and the movement against corruption
 donon hi baar janata nekejarivalke andolan ke badale unhen samarthan diya or un par bharosa jataayaa
 Now for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections Kejriwal once again wants to capture the 7 largest seats of 'indraprastha' through the path of agitation

 On Sunday, the Delhi Chief Minister called a meeting of all AAP mlas and top leaders at his residence
 "LG dilli chodo" kaa diya narabaithak kaa mudda dilli ko purna rajya dilaane ke liye puure pradesh main bade str par andolan chhedana tha
 In this meeting, Kejriwal gave the slogan "quit LG Delhi"
 is baithak ke baad kejariwal ne elaan kar diya he ki dilli kaa chunaav vah puure haq ke mudde par ladenge or ab usee disha main aap andolan chalaane kii taiyaari main jute gai he
 AAP Delhi Pradesh President Gopal Rai said that the Aam Aadmi Party will carry forward the movement of the entire state in Delhi
 17 june se 24 june tak do charan kaa kaarykram hoga
 Meetings will be held at 300 venues in Delhi and under the second phase, there will be a state level conference for the full state at Indira Gandhi Stadium on 1 July, in which the next outline of the movement will be prepared and Kejriwal himself will announce the next strategy
 2015 se lekar dilli main dobaaraa satta hasil karne ke baad kejariwal ke rishte centre main baithi modi sarkaar, dilli main vipakshi party bhartiya janata party or dilli ke mukhya prashaasak uparajyapal ke saath behad kadave rahe hai
 gahe-bahega Arvind Kejriwal has been accusing the Modi government of the Center of obstructing the government's work in Delhi, disturbing the political leadership and bringing the government to a standstill
 philhal kai kendriya agenciyaan kejariwal sarkaar ke kai vibhaagon or unke mantriyon ke khilaaf aaropon kii jaanch kar rahi hai
 AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj said that for 3 years we have tried everything, folded our hands, prayed
 centre sarkaar se lekar grih mantralay se lekar uparajyapal tak, har kisi se baat kii, lekin aaj puri tarah se chautarafa vikaas ke kaam ko thap kiya ja rahaa he, isliye yah sochna padaa he ki purna rajya bananaa he or dilli ke kaam ke rasta ko aage badhanaa he
 a draft of the proposal to give full authority to Delhi is ready
 You have also prepared a blueprint for the proposal to give full rights to Delhi
 is prastaav ke tahat rajdhani kaa nai dilli ilaaka jahaan raashtrapati awaas he, pradhanmantri nivas he, sansad he or videshi duutavas hai, use sidhe-sidhe centre sarkaar ke prashasan main chalaae jane kii baat kahi gai he, jabaki nai dilli ke idhar dilli ko chuni hui dilli ke sarkaar ke adheen karne kii baat kahi gai he
 The AAP alleges that at one time both the BJP and the Congress fought a political battle to give Delhi full rights, which has now been abandoned
 kuch samay pehle kejariwal ne dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja die jane ke masale par rajdhani main refrendom karaane kii baat bhi kahi thi
 The referendum has not happened, but Kejriwal has called a special session in the Delhi Legislative Assembly and has come up with a proposal to grant full statehood to Delhi
 is prastaav ko centre sarkaar ke paas bheja jayega, vahiin duusari taraf sadakon par vipakshiyon ko gherne kii ranneeti bhi taiyaar kii jaaegi
 According to aap's trusted sources, Kejriwal is actually thinking a lot behind this movement
 aam aadmi party ko lagata he ki 2019 main nai dilli main jo bhi satta main aayega use dilli jaise chote rajyon kii 7 siton kii bhi darkaar hogi or aise main samarthan ke badale puraa adhikaar maanga ja saktaa he
 There is a general discussion that AAP will be a part of the grand alliance being formed by the regional parties, but will that grand alliance be able to meet Kejriwal's demand? Other parties also agree to this demand, says Manoj Jha, the newly-elected Rajya Sabha MP of the Rashtriya Janata Dal
 Granting the status of the state is not a favor to the people of Delhi but they have the right and this demand of Kejriwal will have to be met
 argedy ke saath bihar main gathbandhan karke mukhyamantri bane nitish kumaar jab dilli main arvind kejariwal se milane aae the tab unhone bhi dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene jane kii maang kaa samarthan kiya tha
 The leftist CPI also agrees with Kejriwal's demand
 sipiai ke saansad di raja ne bayaan jari karke kaha ki ham dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja die jane kii maang se sahamat hai, kyonki yah rajdhani kii sabase puraani maang he
 Along with Delhi, Puducherry should also have full rights, as there are legislatures in both the places where people choose their government
 dilli main up-rajyapal or chuni hui sarkaar ke bich takaraar bahut zyada he or aise main donon ke adhikaron ko lekar takaraav tab tak chalata rahegaa jab tak use purna rajya kaa darja nahin mil jaataa
 Before the bjp-congress has been promised full rights, we will scrutinize the pages of history, in the elections from 1998 to 2014 and 2015, whether BJP or Congress, everyone promised to give full authority to Delhi in their election manifesto
 bijepi ke shashan kaal main tatkaaleen grahamantri laalkrishna adwani dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene ke liye masauda tak le kar aae the, jise baad main pranab mukherjee kii adhyakshata vaali standing cameti ke paas vichaar karne ke liye bhej diya gaya tha

 At the same time, Sheila Dixit, who was the Chief Minister of Delhi three times, also repeatedly demanded the grant of full state status to Delhi due to the system of having less rights in the past
 yah or baat he ki shila dikshit ko ab lagata he ki dilli main chuni hui sarkaar ko centre kii sarkaar or uparajyapal ke saath sambandh banaakar kaam karnaa padataa he
 Sheila Dixit alleges that Kejriwal is making excuses
 shila dikshit ke is bayaan par kejariwal ne soshal media kaa sahaara liya or likhaa ki shila ji, aapke samay 10 saal centre main aapaki apni sarkaar,apane LG the
 i challenge you to show one year in Delhi under Modi rule
 kripaya puduccheri main apane mukhyamantri se baat karen or unhen bhi yah gyaan den
 In this political nurakushti, the opponents understand Kejriwal's move very well
 shila dikshit ko jahaan lagata he ki kejariwal apni jimmedaariyon se bhaag rahe hai vahi bijepi bhi aarope laga rahi he ki darasal dilli ke mukhyamantri apni jimmedaariyon se bhaag rahe hai
 Delhi Pradesh President Manoj Tiwari says that the BJP is also in favor of giving full rights to Delhi, but for that Arvind Kejriwal should first call an all-party meeting and seek the opinion of scholars
 haalanki bijepi kaa aarope yah bhi he ki vah pani kii kami jaisi duusari samasyaon se jujhate dilli kaa samaadhaan karne main naakaam ho rahe hai isiilie purna rajya kaa mudda uthaa rahe hai

 The investigation of the Bangalore blast case has been intensified

 Chief Minister Jagdish Shettar has expressed suspicion of terrorists being behind the attack
 vaahan ke maalik tak pahunchi poliennai police ne teji se karrwai karte hue bangalore visphot ke liye istemaal hui motorcycle ke registerd maalik kaa pataa laga liya
 a police source said the owner of the motorcycle was traced to the number plate of the motorcycle used for the blast
 motorcycle ritred doorsanchaar karmchaaree kii he, lekin uskaa kahana he ki usne yah motorcycle kareeb 4 varsh pehle bech di thi
 According to the fake number of the motorcycle, the Tamil Nadu registration number (TN 22 r 3769) belongs to KS Shankaranarayanan, resident of Tillai Ganga Nagar
 jaankaree ke mutabik, number plate or motorcycle ke chasis number main fark he, jisase yah pataa chalata he ki number plate farji he
 Sankaranarayanan told the police, 'the motorcycle was in my son's name, but after he moved to America, we sold the motorcycle 4 years ago
 ’ usne kaha ki jab police ne uske ghar kaa daravaaza khatkhataya or use bataaya ki motorcycle kaa istemaal bangalore visphot main hua tha, to vah dang rah gaya
 Police sources said that while they were tracing the number plate of the bike, they were also checking whether fake number plates were used
 rajya police karnataka police or rashtriya jaanch agency ke saath milakar jaanch kar rahi he
 Expressing suspicion of the terrorists being behind the blast, the Karnataka Chief Minister Jagdish Shettar said that the state police had formed a special team to investigate the attack
 visphot sthal kaa daura karne ke baad unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘jald hi ghatana kii jaankaree mil jaaegi or is sambandh main uchit karrwai kii jaaegi

" ’ vidhansabha chunaav se pehle visphot kii sambhavit vajah ke bare main puche jane par mukhyamantri ne andeh jataayaa ki aatankwaadi logon ko aatankit karnaa chaahate hai
 Asked whether the blast was aimed at the BJP, Shettar said that he does not want to give it a political color, but looking at the developments it seems that it can happen

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke akhil bhartiya sampark vibhaag kii teen se chaar agast ko hyderabad ke osmania uniwarsity hyderabad main hui ahm baithak main sampark toliyaan gathit kar vyapak jansampark muhim chalaane kaa faisla hua he
 In this meeting, officials working in liaison department in all the provinces were called
 unhen samaaj ke vishisht vyaktiyon ko sangh se jodne ke saath un logon se khaastaur se samvaad karne kaa tosk saunpa gaya, jo sangh yaa uski vichaardhaara ko lekar jane-anjaane durbhaavna rakhte hai yaa phir gaaliyaan dete hai
 The Sangh is trying to make people who are enemies on the basis of ideology as their friends
 bijepi main 13 varshon tak sanghathan mahaamantri rahane ke baad sangh main vaapasi karne vaale raamalaal kii yah pehali baithak thi
 He attended the meeting as All India Co-liaison Head
 sangh kii sampark vibhaag kii is baithak main kaha gaya ki hamaara target ve log nahin hai jo sangh kaa samarthan karte hai
 They are their own, our main target are those who do not know about the Sangh yet have maliciousness
 hamen gairon ko bhi apana bananaa he
 Our effort should be that if there are no friends, at least there are no enemies
 baithak main kaha gaya ki dekha gaya he ki virodhiyon kii ore se prachaarit galat baton ke chalate logon main sangh ko lekar ek purvaagrah he
 Even those who are neutral, who have nothing to do with the Sangh or any other opposite-minded organization
 unamem bhi zyaadaatar sangh ko lekar galat khyaal rakhte hai
 It was discussed in the meeting that specific people of the society come in the lurch of the image of a communal organization of the union spread by the opponents
 jabaki hakeekat main sangh duniya kaa sabase bada swayamsevi or saamaajik sanghathan he
 In such a situation, all those who are victims of misconceptions about the Sangh should carry out a massive contact campaign on the target
 baithak main shaamil sangh ke ek padaadhikari ne aajtak
 in contact about the work of the department, "this association works to win the hearts of the opponents as well
 isamen bauddhik rup se prakhar, dhairyavan, kamaal kii samvaad kshamta rakhane vaale prachaarak yaa anya str ke kaaryakarta hote hai
 Those who also have the ability to make their own
 sampark vibhaag kaa lakshya he sangh or baahar ke logon ke bich sethu kaa kaam karnaa
 This is very different from the publicity department of the RSS
 haalia varshon main ratan tata, pranav mukherjee jaisi hastiyaan agar sangh ke najadik ain to yah sampark vibhaag kii hi safalataa rahi
 "another Sangh officer said," It was this communication capability that enabled Lord Gautam Buddha, Angulimal, to change his heart
 aise main ham maanate hai ki samvaad main hi vah takat he jo ham virodhiyon ko bhi apana bana sakate hai
 "10 categories were created, prior to contact Homework Association created ten categories of different sections of society for contact
 har shrenee se sampark ke liye vishesh padaadhikariyon kii toli banaai gai he
 In which experienced officials will be included
 masalan, vaigyanik, doctor, ejeeniyar, bijnesaman, soshal varkar, teacher aadi virgon kii hastiyon se sampark ke liye sangh kii alag-alag toli rahegi
 For example, while contacting a doctor, the Sangh will try to have a volunteer doctor or medical person in the team
 taaki samvaad main sahajata ho
 In fact, when two people have a common aspect, there is a greater chance of successful communication between them
 iske alaava sangh kaa sampark vibhaag samaaj ke visisth vyaktiyon ke paas jane se pehle homework karegaa
 Because there is a possibility of communication failing if there is no effective conversation
 sangh kii sampark toli main shaamil log samvaad ke dauraan shabdon ke chayan aadi ko lekar bahut satark rahete hai
 Describing an interesting incident, a Sangh official said that once a great pracharak went to contact retired military officers
 baatcheet ke shuruyaat main unhone kaaphi samay deshbhakti, rashtrawaad kii charchaa main le lee
 To which the military officials said - Brother, we have come in the army, who will know more about patriotism than us, what responsibility do you want to give us, it is better to discuss it in a short time
 kyonki sangh kii vichaardhaara ke kaaran ham iske prakalpon se judana chaahate hai
 According to the Sangh's official, the concerned campaigner later discussed this incident with the big top officials of the Sangh
 jiske baad tay hua ki sampark vibhaag ke padaadhikari bagaiyr homework kiye samaaj ke vishisht vyaktiyon se bhent karne nahin jaaenge

 The Armed Forces Tribunal took a pre-trial questioning the leadership of the army during the 1999 Kargil conflict
 general ko us brigadier ke khilaaf purvaagrah se grast hone kaa doshi tehraaya he jinaki aguwai main kai mahatvapurn kamyaabi mili thi
 According to the tribunal, the former lay general, suffering from prejudice, not only underestimated the achievements of that brigadier but also gave a wrong description of the war
 sena ko sharmasaar karne vaale is faisle main nyaayaadhikaran ne nirdesh diya he ki brigadier (avkashprapt) devinder singh kii sankethik pronnati par vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 The matter came to light when Singh, who led the 70 Infantry Brigade in the Batalik sector during the Kargil conflict, filed a petition in the Delhi High Court complaining that his performance was misrepresented during the conflict
 ullekhneey he ki nyaayaadhikaran ke paas singh kii shikayaton ke samaan hi kai yachikaayen lambit hai
 Take the then General Officer Commanding (GOC)
 general kishan paal kii report kaa khamiyaja singh ko bhugatna padaa tha
 Not only did he have to be deprived of medals but he could not get promoted to the post of Major General
 apane lambey sangharsh ko yaad karte hue singh ne khushi vyakt karte hue kaha ki unke aaropon kii pushti ho gai he
 He said that many obstacles had to be overcome in this order
 brigadier singh (avkashprapt) ne kaha, ‘nyaayaadhikaran ke aadeshaanusaar major general pad par sankethik pronnati ke liye vichaar kiya jayega
 He said that documents related to the conflict during his tenure would also be rectified
 unki yachika ko dilli ucch nyaayalay ne nyaayaadhikaran kii pradhan shakha ko hastantarit kar diya tha
 Singh took it in his petition
 general paal dwaara likhi gai report par aapatti kii thi or usamen sudhaar kiye jane kii maang kii thi
 He said that another officer was preferred in the report and an attempt was made to underperform his achievements
 unhone kaha ki is kaaran unhen kaaphi nuksaan hua
 The tribunal took the relation of Brigadier Singh from the army
 general paal dwaara likhi gai sabhi report hataane ko bhi kaha he

 ovel test main sarender ke saath hi bhartiya cricket team ko england ke haathon paanch match kii test siries main 1-4 se karaari shikast mili he
 There were many occasions in this entire series when Team India could do the result of the match in their favor, India made many mistakes and invited England to return
 is siries main team india 4 baar jeetne kaa hausala haar gai, jisaki vajah se use 4 match ganvaane pad gaye
 Cricket is a team game, does not depend on one or two players
 viraat kohli ne is test siries main 593 ran banaae hai, lekin iske baavjood vah team india ko siries nahin jita paae
 No England batsman may have scored as many runs as Kohli but, yet the English team captured the series
 siries shuru hone se pehle badi-badi baaten kii ja rahi thim, lekin test kii ye number 1 team phiseddi sabit hui he
 From the poor performance in batting, the team's bowlers failed to take wickets on important occasions
 england kii dharti par siries jeetne kaa behatar mauka ganvaane kaa sabase bada kaaran yah rahaa ki bhartiya team jis bhi match main acchhee pakad bana leti to england ke puchhlle ballebaaj us par pani pher dete
 Playing poorly in these moments, India lost Sam Curren in the Birmingham Test proved to be a headache for Team India
 lords main kris vokes ne saatven number par ballebaaji karte hue apane kariyar kaa pehla shatak jadkar bharat ko jeet se maharoom rakhaa or southampton main ek baar phir sam kuren ne birmingham vaali script likh di
 It was expected that the Indian team would save their respect by winning the Test match at the Oval
 lekin, lagaataar mil rahi haar ke kaaran hausala haar chuki team india is match main mejabaan england ko takkar bhi nahin de pai
 After England fell 7 wickets for 181 runs in the first innings, Team India loosened its grip that the last three batsmen of England added 151 runs to put a score of 332 on the board
 ovel main 118 ranon se haari team india, england ne 4-1 se jiti test sirijiske baad rabindra jadeja or hanuma vihari kii badaulat bharat 292 ke score tak pahunch paaya
 In the second innings of England, the Indian bowlers had already laid down their arms and the partnership of 259 runs by Alastair Cook and Joe Root put India out of the match and gave a target of 464 runs like a mountain
 chauthi pari main jab baari bhartiya ballebaajon kii ai to shikhar dhawan (1), cheteshwar pujaara (0) or captain viraat kohli (0) bhi himmat haar gaye or pich par tikne kaa jajba bhi nahin dikhaaya
 However, Rahul and Rishabh Pant, after learning from their previous failures, scored magnificent centuries
 lekin, vah team india ko haar se nahin bachaa paae
 Now what next? Now the real test of Virat's army will be in Australia, because defeating a team like West Indies is not a big deal, that series will be like practice matches for Team India
 england main rishabh pant kaa kamaal- jo dhoni nahin kar paae, wo kar dikhayaballebaaj ke rup main viraat ne ummid se kahin behatar pradarshan kiya he, lekin captain tabhi safal ho saktaa he jab uski team pradarshan karegi
 Expectations from Virat Kohli are always very high and the same will happen in Australia

 The removal of Article 370 was one of the main issues of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 bijepi ne ise hataane kaa vaada kiya tha duusari baar sarkaar main aane ke baad bijepi ne jammu-kashmir ke vishesh darje ko nishprabhavi kar or rajya ko do hisson main baantkar is vaade ko puraa kar diya
 Monday i
e
 August 5 will be remembered as the day in history when the Narendra Modi government removed many provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and divided it into two union territories
 5 agast kii subah jab grih mantri amit shah ne rajyasabha main anuchhed 370 ke praavdhaanon ko hataane ke sankalp pesh kiya to amarnath yatra roki ja chuki thi, paryatakon or chaatro ko jammu-kashmir se baahar nikaala ja chukaa tha, internet sevaayen band ho chuki thim, nishedhagna jari kar di gai thi
 Several leaders, including former CM Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, were placed under house arrest
 congress sahit pramukh vipakshi dalon dwaara kade virodh ke baad bhi vipaksh anuchhed 370 ke prastaav ko rajyasabha main roak paane main vifal rahaa
 At the same time, after the passage of the triple talaq bill in the Rajya Sabha on 31 July, in relation to its main electoral issues, the Modi government got its second success in a week
 india today data intelegence unit (DIU) ne bijepi or congress ke chunaav ghoshnapatron kaa vishleshan kiya or paaya ki jahaan purv main bijepi hameshaa dhara 370 ko khatm karne ke paksh main rahi he, vahiin sabase puraani party is mudde par chuppi saadhe rahi
 Analyzing the election manifestos of both the BJP, the Congress and the Kashmir and the BJP and the Congress, the DIU found that the Congress remained silent on Article 370 in 2009 and 2014
 duusari taraf, bijepi us dauraan apane ghoshnaptr ke jariye ise hataane ke apane sankalp ko doharaati rahi
 Only in the 2009 manifesto did Congress mention 'kashmir', stating that the Congress party government was capable of giving sufficient funds to the state
 jabaki, 2014 main sabase puraani party ne apane chunavi ghoshnaptr main anuchhed 370 ke bare main kuch nahin kaha, vahiin 'kashmir' shabd kaa ullekh keval do jagah kiya
 The Congress had included Kashmir in its manifesto 2 times, in reference to notice of employment and discrimination against students of the state
 2019 main kashmir mudde par congress ke saamne bijepi badi chunauti banakar ubhari jiske baad congress ne apane chunavi ghoshnaptr main jammu or kashmir se sambandhit muddon par ek puraa khand rakhaa
 Between 2009 and 2019, it was the first time the Congress made its stand on Article 370 clear
 congress ke menifesto 2019 main likhaa gaya, 'congress is baat ko doharaati he ki puraa jammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 We also respect the special history of the state and the unique circumstances under which the state accepted the accession to India, which led to the incorporation of Article 370 in the Constitution of India
 is sanvaidhanik sthiti ko badalane kii na to anumati di jaaegi, na hi aisa kuch bhi prayaas kiya jayega
 The Congress also promised to review the Armed Forces (special Powers) Act i
e
 AFSPA in Jammu and Kashmir and the deployment of security forces when it comes to power
 duusari ore, bijepi ke paas kashmir se sambandhit muddon par congress kii tulana main adhik vividh or spasht rukh tha
 In 2009, the BJP mentioned 'kashmir' 12 times in its manifesto, in which it repealed Article 370, empowered pok refugees, resettled Kashmiri Pandits in the Valley, in Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir regions three- Talked about carrying out developmental activities and tackling terrorism etc
 ghoshnaptr main bijepi ne anuchhed 370 ke sandarbh main likhaa, 'dhara 370 rashtriya mukhyadhara ke saath jammu-kashmir ke logon ke saath judane main ek manovaigyanik baadha he
 BJP is committed to repeal this article
 'haalanki, 2014 main, bijepi ke menifesto main kashmir kaa ullekh 12 se ghatakar 6 baar tak hi rah gaya, lekin bijepi rajya par apane rukh ke liye patibaddh rahi
 The BJP said it was firm on its stand to repeal Article 370
 2014 ke ghoshnaptr main bijepi ne kaha, 'bijepi anuchhed 370 par apana rukh doharaati he or sabhi hitdharakon ke saath is par charchaa karegi
 It is also committed to repeal this article
 '2019 main bhi, bijepi ne jammu-kashmir ke muddon par dhyaan dete hue apane menifesto main 6 baar 'kashmir' kaa ullekh kiya
 During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP said in the manifesto, 'we are repeating our vote to remove Article 370 from the time of Jana Sangh
 'bijepi or kashmiri muddon ke saath iskaa sambandhbijapi kii sthapana 1980 main hui thi
 The first evidence of the party's disagreement on Article 370 is found in its 1984 manifesto
 isamen bijepi ne vishesh rup se jammu-kashmir ke sandarbh main is anuchhed kaa ullekh nahin kiya tha, lekin vah 'asthaayee anuchhed 370 ko hataanaa' chaahati thi
 In 1989, the BJP reiterated its promise to repeal Section 370, and also expressed concern about the growing 'hatred campaign' being run in the state by 'pro-pakistani' elements
 1991 main ghati se hinduon kaa palaayan hua
 The BJP manifesto then expressed its concern over the violence affecting the Hindus of the state and promised to overthrow the Pakistani elements from the Valley, besides repeating its stand on Section 370
 1996 main bijepi ke gathbandhan vaali rajg pehali baar satta main ai thi, jab atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar 13 dinon main bahumat nahin hone ke kaaran gir gai thi
 The party also took a broad view on issues related to Kashmir in the 1996 election manifesto
 party ke vijan document main 16 baar kashmir kaa ullekh kiya gaya tha
 It said that three regional councils for Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir were set up
 bijepi ne apane ghoshnaptr main rajya kii congress sarkaar kii chetana main kami kii bhi aalochana kii thi, jiske kaaran seemaa se sambandhit muddon ko prabhavit kiya tha
 In the 1996 manifesto, BJP wrote, 'congress governments have failed to formulate the policy of Jammu and Kashmir, due to which internal problems of the state have created a situation which has emerged as a major challenge for Indian nationality
 bijepi ko is bhayaavah chunauti kaa ehsaas he
 The party dedicates itself to solving the internal problems of the state, but is also committed to working towards reclaiming part of its territory illegally occupied by Pakistan for nearly 5 decades
 '1998 main, bijepi ke netritv vaale rajg (gathbandhan) ne phir se sarkaar banaai, lekin bahumat ke abhaav main ek saal main hi sarkaar gir gai
 However, the party's stand on Kashmir did not change
 1999 main, bijepi ne ek bahut chota ghoshnaptr jari kiya jisamen kashmir kaa ullekh nahin tha
 However, since 2004, the party has been actively pursuing its vision for Kashmir
 bijepi ne apane 1999 ke ghoshnaptr main anuchhed 370 ko lekar kuch bhi ullekh nahin kiya tha
 5 years after the NDA government, Article 370 again disappeared from the bjp's vision document in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki, rajya ke teen-tarafa vikaas ke bare main party kii drushti abhi bhi jas kii tas thi
 After 2009, Article 370 once again appeared in the bjp's vision document, which was implemented by the Narendra Modi government at the Center with the BJP on 5 August 2019
 note: bijepi ne 1984 ke aam chunaavon ke baad se apane sabhi ghoshnapatron ko digital kar diya he jo isaki website par uplabdh hai
 We were unable to analyze the Congress manifesto as its digital numbers were available only after the 2009 elections

 haalanki peediton kii samasya ko dekhte hue bhartiya telecom company idia ne chennai or tamilnadu ke shahari ilaakon main customer centre kii sarvice phir se shuru kar di he
 The company is also giving 10 local minutes and 50MB 2G data from December 2 to its customers' mobiles

 Madhya Pradesh, considered among the three largest states of India, is in the headlines these days due to the police encounter of members and prisoners under consideration of banned Islamic organization- Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI)
 rajya ke mukhiya shivaraj singh chouhan, grih mantri bhupendra singh thakur, inspector general of police or jail mantri ke bayanon main samya nahin dikh rahaa
 State police say that all these undertrials escaped from Bhopal's Central Jail
 jail se bhaagane ke kram main inhone ek head kanstable kii hatya bhi kar di
 The more things continue, the more mouths
 haalanki is puure ghatnakram kaa asar sidhe-sidhe pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf jaataa dikh rahaa he
 Despite their efforts, they seem to be failing to gain the trust of the country's largest minority community or, say, the second largest majority community
 vipaksh ke liye baithebithae mil gaya mauka
 
 
 The dead opposition of Madhya Pradesh has shone again in the eyes
 ve phir se raakh main phoonk maarane lage hai
 Digvijay Singh is taking the government in the dock with tweets and statements
 ve poochhate hai ki aakhir sirf musalmaan hi kyon jelon se bhaag rahe hai
 Other top Congress leaders Kamal Nath are also trying to dominate
 congress ke rajya prabharee mohan prakaash bhi koi korkasar nahin chhod rahe to vahiin jyotiraditya sindhiya bhi phir morche par aa date hai
 Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal is also calling this encounter fake
 unhen twitor ke madhyam se modi sarkaar par khul kar hallaa bolaa he
 Apart from this, the disappearance of a minority community student (najeeb Ahmed) from JNU, a leading educational institution of the country, for the last 16-17 days after clashing with Vidyarthi Parishad, a student organization of RSS, is also giving opportunity to the opposition
 narendra modi ke saare kiye dhare par pani phir janaa
 
 
 After Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of the country in May 2014, the Modi government has always been trying to move forward and show up with the slogan 'sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'
 ve aae din alpsankhyak samudaay ke liye nai-nai skim ghoshit kar rahe hai
 Whether it is the 'nai Manzil' scheme or the 'ustad' scheme launched for Muslim artisans
 bhaajapa ke pramukh alpsankhyak chehre ke taur par shumaar kiye jane vaale mukhtaar abbaas nakvi dwaara musalamaanon ke bich bhaajapa or narendra modi kii saakh sthapit karne ke lieprogressive panchayat abhiyanka shuru kiya janaa or 'madad hamaari manzil aapaki' jaise naaron ke sahare unhen bhaajapa kii ore aakarshith karnaa bhi he
 They are calling it the politics of going out of the vote deal and following the draft development
 iske baavjood samay-samay par narendra modi kialpsankhyak samudayaper hone vaale hamalon par sadhi gai chaynaatmak chuppi bahuton ko nagavar gujri he
 Whether it is Akhlaq being killed in a cow vigilant attack in Uttar Pradesh or a case of hanging Muslim cattle traders from a tree in the aftermath of the cow vigilantes in Latehar, Jharkhand
 unke vaktavy or krititv main fark saaf-saaf dikh rahaa he
 Apart from this, the stature of the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh will increase within and outside the BJP after the police encounter
 musalamaanon kii kahani, aankadon kii jubaani
 
 
 It is also not that this police brutality on Muslims of India is the first case
 ve is desh ke duusare sabase bade bahusankhyak samudaay hai
 If they are included in the mirror of the National Crime Reports Bureau (2015) after including them with the Dalits and Adivasis of this country, then 55 percent of the cases are under consideration in different courts of the country
 haalanki, in teenon samudaayon kii kul jansankhya bharat ke jansankhya kii 39 fisadi he
 Apart from this, the figures of these undertrials being declared criminals are just 50
 4 fisadi hai
 Such cases are pending in different courts of the country
 kai baar to in kathith aatankiyon ko court ne kuch sabit na hone kii halaat main choda bhi he
 Obviously, such incidents would prove to be intimidating rather than reassuring the minority community
 ve bhaajapa ke najadik aane ke bajaay usase dur hi jaaenge
 Discounts on the credibility of the court and the law
 
 
 is jail se faraar hone or phir police dwaara unke encounter par vipaksh to mukhar hua hi he
 Apart from this, it is also discounted on the credibility of law
 aakhir vichaaradhin kaidi to rajya or judiciri ke jimme hote hai
 The police and the government are also the only party in this situation
 jab tak kisi par aarope sabit na ho jaaen tab tak vah nirdosh hi mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, the Criminals were ever going to surrender who would suspect that the state police would eventually kill them and they got justice from the court
 yah encounter jahaan narendra modi ke alpsankhyakon ko rijhaane kii kavayad ko tabah karne kii kshamta rakhata he vahiin is desh kii court or kanoon ke liye ek cese study bhi sabit hoga

 kuch vakt pehle chunaav ayog main register hui ek party arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party ke liye pareshaani ban kar ai
 AAP leaders were so upset with this party that they went straight to the Delhi High Court
 puraa maajaraa kya he yah samajhane ke liye pehle ham aapako is party kaa naam bataate hai
 The name of the new party registered with the Election Commission is 'your own party'
 sankshep main kahen to AAP
 a party with this name is already registered in Delhi
 dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal is party ke kartadharta hai
 As soon as this party was registered, the Aam Aadmi Party dragged this new party to the court saying that the name of this party resembles that of their party and the voters may get confused while voting
 jab maamla court pahunchaa to dilli hoicourt ne chunaav ayog se is maamle main jawaab maanga
 In the hearing held on Tuesday, the Election Commission has said in its reply to the court that whenever it registers a new party, it does not look at the abbreviation, but the full name of the party being registered
 chunaav ayog ne court ko bataaya nai party ko bhi register karte vakt iskaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he or donon partiyon ke bich main bhram kaa koi kaaran ho hi nahin saktaa kyonki donon kaa naam alag alag he
 However, this new party 'your own party' has sought some more time from the Delhi High Court to file its reply in this matter
 adaalat ne is maamle main aapaki apni party or aam aadmi party ko jawaab dene ke liye 22 farvari tak kaa vakt diya he
 Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party has taken the matter to court because they feel that if voters are confused by the names of these two parties, then the votes of Aam Aadmi Party can go to your own party
 yachika main aam aadmi party kii taraf se guhaar lagaai gai he ki is party kaa registration radd kiya jaae
 The matter is now scheduled for hearing in February
 kejariwal kii party ke virodh ko dekhte hue aapaki apni party kaa bhavishya kya hoga yah farvari main hone vaali sunwaayee se hi tay ho paaegaa

 Janpath is a path in Delhi, the capital of the Republic of India
 iske do makaanon kaa number he 10 or 12
 10, Janpath is the home of Sonia Gandhi and 12, Janpath is of Ram Vilas Paswan
 donon kii diwaar tak ek he, magar aaj mehmaan padosi nahin, balki ve the, jinhen kabhi paswan sampradayik bataakar chhod aae the
 Paswan is senior to Nitish in the matter of leaving the BJP, when he made a sharp comment on Nitish's separation that he has become a martyr by cutting his nails
 aaj paswan 12 saal baad endie main laut aae or apni 2002 vaali mahaan shahadat jediu, argedy or congress ke nochane ke liye chhod gaye hai
 You cannot understand the politics of Bihar without the word cinereo
 sinerio kya bana is par aane se pehle aaj ke seen sinari par nazar daalate hai
 This afternoon Ravi Shankar Prasad reached Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Shahnawaz Hussain 12, Tughlaq Road
 tasviir main to aise lag rahaa he, jaise pehali baar yahaan aae hon
 Leader in court pants at the door, Hero Chirag Paswan, chairman of the more visible parliamentary board, welcomes and the three go to meet LJP national president and Chirag's father Ram Vilas Paswan
 baahar aakar ravishankar ne kaha ki chaay or mithai khaane aae the
 Sweet but sweet
 baap re
 
 
 So is umr main thik-thaak feet dikhne vaale ravishankar yaa rudi yaa shahanvaj ne chaay se pehle mithai bhi khai hogi, mujhe nahin lagata, kya pataa khai bhi ho
 It seems Nitish and Lalu will be eating salty with tea today
 tatpashchaat seen sinari change hota he
 Chirag Paswan goes to Dharmendra Pradhan's house in Shahnawaz's car
 shahanvaj ji kii gaadi kaa number bhi james band tip he

 The pose is such that everything is final
 bas u arriya aap dekh lijiega, aa aara ham sambhaal lenge
 Exactly 10 years ago, 10 left Janpath and went to Sonia Paswan's house at 12 Janpath
 27 disambar, 2003 kii is tasviir ne khub sansani paidaa kii thi, jaise aaj chiraag or rudi kii tasviir paidaa kar rahi he
 Then joining Paswan was Sonia's master stroke, today Modi repeated that master stroke
 bihar main aaj kis par kya lot rahaa hoga or koun kahaan lot rahaa hoga, yah jaanane ke liye prime time mat dekhie, patna phone kiijie
 After all, why did the Congress, Lalu allow Paswan and Modi took Paswan? Mistakes and misunderstandings in politics are like girlfriends
 nariwadi aaj ke liye maaf karen
 Now come to cinereo
 kya bihar kii raajnneeti phir se jaat−paat kii ore ja rahi? bihar main modi lahar, aandhi elaan karne vaali bijepi ko kushvaha or paswan jaise sthaneey bavandaron kii jarurat kyon padi? kya nitish ke vikaas kii raajnneeti main jaatpaat nahin tha? mahadalit or atipichhadaa kya he? kya congress, lalu ke paas yadav aadhaar ke kaaran nahin ja rahi he? kya bijepi or modi vanshavaad ko samaapt karne kaa mudda paswan ke kaaran chhod denge? Ram Vilas Paswan is the national president of LJP, son Chirag Paswan is the chairman of the LJP parliamentary board
 ramchandra paswan lojpa ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh hai
 Another brother Paras Paswan is the president of Bihar LJP

 Modi, who is on a campaign to eradicate dynasty, is finding and removing dynasty from its roots

 It is said that the heart of Badal Badal Sahib is in agriculture and farming and the heart of Badal Badal is in industries
 ek sawaal uthegaa ki in teenon dalon ke parivaar kaa koi pradhanmantri pad kaa daavedaar nahin he
 Now if this is the scale to make a difference about dynasty, then one must agree today, because today is Shivratri and you know more about Neelkanth than me
 raajnneeti main lahar se zyada jehar kaam aata he
 Have to drink

 In the article published in Dainik Jagran, political scribe LN Sharma has raised some questions about where are those people who were talking about changing the voters and ending caste politics
 kyon sushasan kii raajnneeti karne vaale nitish ko argedy se netaa laana pad rahaa he or kyon bijepi ko paswan pasand aa rahe hai? Another political scholar Jitendra Narayan said on the phone that the young voter of Bihar has gone beyond this
 vah jati se upar uthakar un muddon kii pahchaan karata he, jisamen sabakaa hit he
 It is also happening because the fight for social justice is over
 jitendra narayan ne ek or baat kahi ki jitna supreme court kii clin chit se modi ko manyata nahin mili, usase kahin zyada paswan ke saath aane se mili he
 This is what LN Sharma says in Dainik Jagran's article that Nitish says that Modi is not inclusive
 modi ne kushvaha or paswan ko milakar nitish ke is daawey par sawaal uthaa diya
 Will Bihar mandate its share in 2014 only on the basis of caste
 yahi yatharth he, to phir janadesh kaa matlab kya hoga? jatiyon kaa gathbandhan yaa kuch or

 jo pen se bank afasaron ne subah unki line main number ke mutabik likh diya tha
 If the mouth turns dark in the morning, you will get the number, whether you get the money or not
 paseene se number mit gaya to phir gaye
 Every few minutes the anger of the people standing in the queue erupts

 On Monday evening, the RBI had announced to raise more than 24,000 weekly
 lekin log kehete hai ki nae note kyon jamaa karaaen, aakhir logon ko bank pehle 24,000 to dilaayen phir seemaa badhaaen
 Only things are happening on a large scale, on the ground the same situation as the first day
 zyaadaatar bainkon main 4000 se 10,000 tak kii seemaa main hi paise mil rahe hai
 The comments nishandehi ke bhi ajeeb tareeke nikaale ja rahe hai

 The bank officers had written in their line according to the number in the morning from Joe Pen
 agar subah munh andhere aa gaye to number mil jaayegaa, paisa mili yaa nahin
 The number was lost due to sweat and then went away

 People say that they keep coming in line to take money by keeping holidays in their jobs, yet are not getting it
 aakhir chuttee bhi kitne din rakhi ja sakati he, tankhwaah to cat hi jaati he
 The failure of the entire system is evident

 In view of the Haryana Assembly elections, BJP President Amit Shah arrived late to rally in Mahendragarh, but the enthusiasm of the supporters in the rally also encouraged Shah
 shah ne deree ke liye maafee maangi or logon se apil kii ki ve chautaala-huda ke ghere se baahar nikalen
 Shah made it clear that the party would not form an alliance with the INLD in the state and would win on its own
 raily main apane sambodhan kii shuruyaat karte hue amit shah ne kaha ki vah dilli se sahi samay se nikle the, lekin raste main raily kii vajah se unhen deree ho gai
 Pleased with the crowd of supporters, Shah said that the support of the people shows that the days of Congress and HUDA government from Haryana are now going
 bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha, 'haryana kii janata ne 2014 ke aam chunaav main hi apana mood bataa diya tha
 We won 7 seats by fighting 8 seats
 'gathbandhan nahin, ekala chalo re kii raahvidhansabha chunaav ke babat bhartiya rashtriya lok dal se gathbandhan kii tamaam ashankaon or kayaason ko khaarij karte hue amit shah ne kaha ki bijepi INLD ke saath gathbandhan nahin karegi
 Shah said, 'if we come with anyone, it will be for the people of Haryana
 lekin agar yah haryana ke logon ko pasand nahin he to bijepi akele hi rasta tay karegi
 Accusing the state government of malfeasance, Amit Shah said that the law and order situation in Haryana is very bad and the government is not paying any attention to it
 bijepi adhyaksh ne logon ko bharosa dilaayaa ki centre sarkaar ne jo vaade kiye hai wo puure kiye jaaenge or sarkaar apana hisaab degi
 Earlier it was discussed in secret that there are two centers of power in New Delhi and due to the efforts in it, many big decisions could not be taken or controversial decisions were taken
 lekin ab yah baat khulkar saamne aa hi gai
 The new book 'the Accidental Prime Minister' by Dr
 Sanjay Baru, the then media advisor to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, opened all the polls
 unhone kai haroonges baton kaa khulaasa kiya he
 This book clearly states that although Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister, but the government was run by Sonia Gandhi
 isamen kai chaunkaane vaali baaten bhi hai
 For example, without informing Manmohan Singh, the finance ministry was given to Pranab Mukherjee, A
 Raja was inducted into the cabinet despite his opposition, the PM was ready to resign on the issue of atomic issues, senior ministers did not listen to him, etc
 Et cetera
 isi tarah kii kai pareshaan karne vaali baaten is kitaab main he jaise sonia gandhi hi har mahatvapurn file par nirnay leti thim
 All these revelations can make the Congress party sources sleep in the election campaign
 yah kitaab yah bhi bataati he ki desh ke sabase bade naukarshahon main se ek pulok chatarji darasal sonia gandhi ko har baat bataate the jabaki vah piem ke karyaalay main the
 Of course, the timing of this book can be questioned and it can be said that it has been released at this time to increase sales
 yaa phir kisi khaas iraade se ise chapa gaya he
 But the bigger truth is that these things have power because they were floating in the air for a long time
 agar aisa hua to uskaa parinaam aaj congress party dekh rahi he
 Till yesterday, how powerful this party is in front of the public
 chunaav ke parinaam chaahe kuch bhi hon, yah khulaasa lambey samay tak uske liye pareshaani kaa sabab bana rahegaa
 It is a cruel joke with the democratic system of the country, in which a Prime Minister is waiting for someone else's orders for every decision
 pradhanmatri sarvopari hota he or use khud faisle lene kaa haq he, aisa ham varshon se sunate aae hai lekin is kitaab ne is baat kii hawa nikaal di he
 a Prime Minister who earned immense fame as Finance Minister, was so helpless in his new assignment
 or iskaa nateeja puure desh ne policy paralisis ke rup main jhela
 Major decisions could not be made for months, if plans were made, they were not implemented properly and above all, it is not known what the Government's position is on a particular issue
 yah sab dukhad he or bhartiya loktantr ke maathe par ek kalank jaisaa he
 Ashok Singh's family is sitting outside the house to be photographed on the throne
 purvi uttar pradesh ke baliya jile ke raajpur ikuna gaanv kaa yah parivaar gram swaraj kaa brands ambesder banane ke liye photo nahin khinchvaa rahaa
 He is in front of the camera to bring the poison of arsenic (arsenic) which has come out of the body in the form of rashes and lumps in the eyes of the world

 Ashok Ketcha Raj Bahadur Singh died of arsenic poisoning a fortnight ago
 parivaar main do saal ke bheetar arsenic se yah duusari maut he
 At least 70 people have visited the area in ten years
 lagbhag 2,200 kii aabaadi vaale is hare-bhare gaanv ke pani main arsenic kii maatra 500 microgram prati litre yaa part par billian (peepibi) tak pahunch chuki he
 This amount is 50 times higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 10 ppb
 haalanki sarkaar 50 peepibi ke upar kii hi maatra ko khatarnaak maanati he
 3 of 310 villages like Rajpur Ekona in Ballia
 5 lakh kii aabaadi arsenic vaala pani pine ko majaboor he
 1,018 villages of seven districts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh including Ballia - Kheri (165 villages), Bahraich (438 villages), Bareilly (14 villages), Gorakhpur (45 villages), Ghazipur (24 villages) and Chandauli (19 villages) officially Arsenic ones are infested with water
 in jilon kii taadaad jald hi or badhegi
 An investigation by Jadavpur University's School of Environment Studies (SES) found that ground water in Varanasi, Allahabad and Kanpur has also been hit by arsenic
 elahabaad ke lailapur kalam main arsenic kaa str 707 peepibi or kanpur se sate unnav ke shuklaganj main arsenic kii maujuudagi 316 peepibi tak ke behad khatarnaak str tak pahunch gai he
 That is, the whole state is moving towards serious diseases like arsenicosis, carcinosis, lung, skin, kidney and bladder cancer due to arsenic
 ganga ke maidaanon main arsenic ke asar ke bare main esies ke diarector research, professor dipankar chakravarti kehete hai, ''hamane ganga ke antim chor bengal kii khadi ke paas ke ilaakon se arsenic kii maujuudagi kii khoj shuru kii thi or jaanch ganga ke muhane kii taraf jari he
 Arsenic was found in Assam, West Bengal, Bangladesh, Jharkhand and Bihar, followed by coastal Ganges in eastern Uttar Pradesh
 kheti ke liye bhu-jal kaa betahasha dohan karne se ganga ke maidaanon main jameen ke bheetar pani main arsenic kii maatra kai guna bad gai he, isliye yahaan ke borwell or hand pump jaharila pani ugal rahe hai
 Chakravarty, one of the top scientists worldwide who researched arsenic, first announced arsenic in Ballia in 2003
 lekin us samay sarkaar ne arsenic kii maujuudagi ko sire se khaarij kar diya tha
 However, governments have not been able to withstand the effects of increasing arsenic in the area for a long time and finally when the government wakes up in a government style
 sirf baliya jile main hi arsenicyukt pani se nijaat dilaane ke liye uttar pradesh jal nigam ne kareeb 100 karod ru
 Have spent
 is rakam se ilaake main 66 pani kii tankiyaan banaai ja rahi hai
 One to three crores Rs
 tak kii laagat se bani in tankiyon ke pani ko pipeline ke jariye gaanv ke ghar-ghar tak pahunchane kaa sarkari iraadaa he
 But the special thing is that in any of the villages India Today visited, people have not taken a connection to the government water tank in their home
 sonbarasa gaanv kii pani kii tank par tainaat karmchaaree manoj bataate hai, ''pichley 17 din se tank se pani kii supplai nahin hui he, kyonki pipe- line tuuti hui he
 No village man has taken a connection to the tank
 ''arsenic peediton ke liye kaam kar rahe gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan inner wais ke sanyojak saurabh singh ne bataaya, ''arsenic peediton kii niyamit swasthya jaanch kaa bhi koi bandobast najar nahin aata
 No one is aware of what was used for the arsenic awareness program
 '' unhone kaha ki is bare main ve rajya or centre sarkaar ke str par sawaal uthaate rahe hai, lekin koi thos nateeja nahin niklaa jabaki arsenic kaa str din par din badhata ja rahaa he
 Following the widespread complaints from the area, the Union Rural Development Ministry sent an expert team of National Level Monitor (NLM) here to investigate the matter
 enelem kii report ne yahaan bade paimaane par aniyamittaaon kii baat to maani, saath hi pipeline bichaane main bhrashtachar kii taraf bhi ishaara kiya
 "66 tanks have been built for water supply in all 17 blocks of Ballia," the report said
 enelem ne paanch jagahon kaa daura kiya or sab jagah pipeline tuuti pai gai or pipe line kii kawarej bhi uchit nahin he
 In this way, the water supply is not right
 '' bhrashtachar ke aarope par enelem report main kaha gaya he, ''is samvedansheel mudde par kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Yet, seeing the reporting of many incidents and newspapers clearly smells of corrupt alliances
 '' report ke baavjood ab tak kisi afasar par karrwai saamne nahin ai he
 On the matter of corruption in the report, the Managing Director of Uttar Pradesh Water Corporation A
 ke
 Srivastava said, "there will be problems in some places
 unhen jald durust kiya jayega
 The State Water Sanitation Mission is preparing for a third party investigation
 '' maje kii baat he ki pradesh ke pramukh sachiv (jal sansaadhan) ke aadesh ko 11 maheene biit jane ke baad bhi third party monitering kii taiyaari hi chal rahi he
 About the permanent solution to the problem, Chakraborty explains, "the permanent solution is to stop the rainwater in the ponds and dig traditional wells
 kuon main satat oxikaran ke kaaran arsenic kii maatra pani main nahin bad paati
 All other measures are immediate and will increase rather than reduce the problem in the long run
 ''lekin in upayon ke aane tak yatnaa kaa daur barkaraar rahegaa
 The condition is that the government hospitals in the area do not consider these diseases to be linked to arsenic
 ashok singh kii maane to unke pita ko das saal pehle is beemaari ke lakshan gambhir rup se saamne aae
 Doctors at the local level refused to consider it a case of arsenic

 Over 70 people have died due to arsenic in Beria block of Ballia in a decade, while the number of people living with creepy effects is in lakhs
 isi gaanv ke rishidev yadav (65) ko haal hi main cancer hone kii pushti hui he
 Yadav, who is undergoing treatment in Varanasi, said, "the doctors said that due to the effect of arsenic, i had cancer
 gaanv main mere jaise kai log hai, lekin har aadmi ilaaj par itnaa kharch nahin kar saktaa
 Every third person in the village has stomach diseases
 '' bagal ke gaanv chaiyn chhapra kii munni devi (26 varsh) ke pairon main chakatte ubhar aae hai
 Munni said, "I have had these rashes after about five years of marriage
 maayke main mujhe kori pareshaani nahin thi
 This water is causing disease
 '' unke ghar filter vaala sarkari handpump bhi laga lekin kuch din main vah bhi jehar ugalane laga
 Arsenic poison has reached every household
 lakhon log iske shikaar hai par sarkari doctor unki beemaari ke lakshanon ko arsenic kaa nateeja maanane se inkaar kar rahe hai
 The arrangement made for providing drinking water is not effective

 The latest pictures of Dawood Ibrahim have already come to the government
 ab don kii aawaaj ko bhi sarkaar ke jasuson ne tepe kar liya he
 In a tape attached to the government, Dawood is saying, 'my people are my eyes and ears
 isliye mujhe baithe-baithe duniya kii khabar mil jaati he
 The Prime Minister himself does not roam the streets
 mere lafj dastauez hai
 Documents can be torn, but i do not order
 ’ is andaaj main daaud dhamkee detaa he
 He was threatening to sit in the coastal city of Karachi in Pakistan and his voice was recorded in Dubai
 pakistan kii sena or khufia agency iesai kii nigaraanee main daaud ibrahim karachi ke cliffton ilaake ke white house naam kii building main aaraam se rahata he
 From this house, when he was doing a property deal worth billions of rupees in Dubai, the intelligence agencies taped Dawood's live conversation

 ’daaud ibrahim ne pehali baar phone par ye kabool kiya ki wo karachi ke ghar main baithkar hi duniya bhar kii deal karata aayaa he
 It is clear from Dawood's words that in 20 years in Pakistan, the government has been so kind to him that he has started considering himself as equal to the Prime Minister of Pakistan
 daaud ko bhartiya police pichley do dashak se talash kar rahi he
 During this time, the government gathered so much evidence that it is clear that Dawood is in Pakistan
 lekin pakistani sarkaar har baar ise jhutlaati rahi
 But during a phone conversation, Dawood himself admitted that he lives in Clifton Road house in Karachi
 pakistan kii hukumat chaahe general musharraf ke haath main rahi ho yaa navaj sharif ke, islamabad kii sarkaron ne daaud ibrahim kii karachi main maujuudagi se hameshaa hi inkaar kiya he

 On the 14th of August, Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar, in an education festival held in Jaipur, gathered a lot of praise to Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and Minister of State for Education Vasudev Devnani and said that they are bringing the same change in the education system of the state
 jo centre duusari jagahon par lagu kar rahaa he
 He specifically mentioned how Rajasthan was the first state to end the No Detention Policy in schools
 shiksha ke adhikaar ke tahat kaksha 8 tak ke vidhyaarthiyon ko bagaiyr pariksha paas kiye agali kaksha main bhejne kii is niti kii vajah se shiksha ke str main giravat dekhi ja rahi thi
 Learning from Rajasthan, the Center formed a committee of Education Ministers from 28 states led by Devnani
 inamen se 23 shiksha mantriyon ne kaksha 5 se aage pariksha kii vyavastha dobaaraa shuru karne kii sifarish kii or yah bhi ki pariksha main fail hone vaale chaatro ko sudhaar kaa ek or mauka diya jayega, jisamen shikshak unki madad karenge
 On 3 August, the Union Cabinet approved an amendment to the Right to Education Act to repeal the No Detention (failure) policy
 isse rajasthan ke un prayogon ne desh bhar kaa dhyaan khinchaa jo rajya ke skulon main shiksha pranali main sudhaar ke liye lagu kiye ja rahe hai
 Raje demanded from his minister and officers that the students of class six should solve their maths questions in such a way that they can show them in any survey of any agency
 yahi baat javdekar ne bhi doharaai jab unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar ise desh ke har skool main lagu karnaa chaahati he
 Both also said that this can be done by bringing parents, teachers, students, community and schools together
 disambar 2013 main mukhyamantri kii kursi sambhalate hi raaje ne is agenda par jor dena shuru kar diya tha
 He included Devanani, an old rss-agitated leader in his cabinet, who is an engineering graduate and therefore could have reconciled nationalism with the modern outlook
 unhone devnani ko pramukh shikshashastriyon kii ek samiti di, jisamen study haul ajukeshan foundation kii urvashi saahani or vasant vaili skool ke diarector arun kapur bhi the
 On August 18, Raje told India Today, "we wanted to transform the way schools are run
" '' iske liye unhone sarkaar ke haathon sanchalit skulon main abhibhavak-shikshak baithkon kii vyavastha lagu kii, jo abhi tak nijee skulon tak hi mahadood thi
 She explains, "in less than a year, three million parents have attended these meetings
 '' in koshishon ke falswaroop das lakh se zyada chaatr nijee skool chhodkar sarkari skulon main aa gaye hai
 Encouraged by Javadekar's praise, Devnani cites the 11th Annual Education Status Report (rural) 2016 (ASER) released in January 2017 as well as the 2016 State Learning Achievement Survey
 ye adhyayan bataate hai ki in koshishon kii badaulat shiksha kii haalat main thodaa sudhaar aayaa he or kuch maamalon main rajya rashtriya ausat se aage nikal gaya he
 Enrollment in government schools has increased for the first time since the right to education, while enrollment in private schools has declined
 devnani kehete hai, ''mukhyamantri chaahati thim ki ham gaiyr-jaruri skulon main katautee karke kharchon ko tarksangat banaaen
 "therefore, they merged several schools like Anganwadi, Primary, Secondary and Senior Secondary
 skool shiksha ke principal secretary naresh gangavar kehete hai ki digital vyavasthaaon ko sucharu or saral bana diya gaya he or rajkaaj ko sudhara gaya he
 Government decisions on groups and sub-groups and video conferences on whatsapp reach everyone in a blink of an eye and big officials and ministers can see attendance at a click of the mouse

 Maoist groups across South Asia have decided to reunite after five years to strengthen the Naxalite movement

 The report, based on ground assessment, warns that the Maoists are getting ready to carry out major deadly attacks

 In comparison, the current level of weapons of the Central Reserve Police (CRPF), which is mainly handling the responsibility of dealing with the security forces, especially the Maoists, and the level of training being given to its jawans is completely inadequate

 The Home Ministry also found that the number of security forces personnel to deal with the Maoists is insufficient

 The Maoists are well-versed in the densely forested areas and are adept in guerrilla fighting, which benefits them

 If the CRPF is to lead an anti-terrorism operation, it needs a basic restructuring; The average age of his jawans will have to be reduced, his way of working as a battalion (in which the commandant leads the operation) will have to be changed and former army short service commission officers and former jcos, ncos and sfs and infantry battalions Jawans and officers have to be included in it

 Students from other parties including ABVP and NSUI student leaders also reached to fill their nominations
 namakan daakhil karne ke baad chaatr sanghathan ke sambhavit ummidavaaron ne campus main shakti pradarshan bhi kiya
 There is so much hype in these elections that it also becomes a question of credibility
 aise main power or paisa donon kaa istemaal bhi khuleam ho gaya he
 Though the guidelines for DUSU elections have been issued and the code of conduct is in force, the rules and regulations are being hoisted in the campus
 dusu chunaav kii taarikh ke elaan ke saath hi prachaar kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 The credibility of organizations is at stake, so no one wants to be left behind in publicity and posterity
 diu kii har diwaar poster se pati padi he
 Not just the wall, but posters on the benches, dustbins, electric poles, tea stalls as well as the roads and flyovers around the campus
 aisa tab ho rahaa he jab aachaar samhita lagu ho chuki he
 The Lyngdoh Committee recommendations are being openly violated in the DUSU elections
 guidelins ke mutabik wal of demokrasi ke alaava diu main kahin bhi poster chaspa nahin kiye ja sakate
 Posters to be printed should also be handmade
 iske baavjood naa sirf campus ke ird gird balki campus main bhi khuleam guidelins kii dhajjiyaan ud rahi hai
 Because of the round-a-election, student organizations have their own excuses ready
 kya kehete hai abivipi ke rashtriya media sanyojak?saket bahuguna ke mutabik ve les paper campan ko pramot kar rahe hai
 It is true that the students are putting up posters, but the way every year the students are getting short for publicity is getting shorter
 aise main 2 dinon main 51 college ke lakhon chaatro tak baat pahunchane ke liye posters jaruri hai
 They also want the Wall of Democracy in every college so that students do not put up posters here or there on public property
 iske liye ve chunaav samiti ko bhi patr likhane kii baat kehete hai
 So at the same time, according to NSUI state president Akshay Lakra, NSUI is spreading its word among the students by putting at least posters
 ve kehete hai ki campus ko badrang karne kaa iraadaa kisi chaatr netaa kaa nahin hota
 Despite the ban, posters have been ignored for several years during the election
 lihaaja chunaav ayog ne sabhi sanghathanon par najar rakhane ke liye chah videographer kii ek team ko jimmedaari saunpi he
 Along with the announcement of the election, recording of various activities of activists of student organizations is being done on campus
 iske baavjood guidelins kii avmaananaa karne vaale chaatr sanghathanon or candidats par karrwai nahin hoti
 According to the Election Committee, action cannot be taken until the nomination is final
 aisa isliye kyonki uniwarsity kisi chaatr sanghathan ko chinhit nahin karti
 However, the DU administration has decided to cancel the nomination of the accused candidates as well as register a criminal case against the posters
 no poster party bhi campus main activearope- pratyarope ke bich dusu chunaav puri tarah raajnneeti ke rang main ranga he
 Promotions will intensify in the coming days
 aise main jahaan ek taraf chaatr sanghathanon kii ore se posterbaji jari he
 On the other hand, DU students are running a 'no Poster Party' campaign
 miranda house kii chaar students ne fasebuk par ek pej banaakar diu se postaron ko hataane kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya
 On seeing this, around 80 volunteers also joined this campaign
 ab ye studentsbadrang campasko saaf karne main jute hai
 According to Maraya, a student of Miranda House, during DUSU elections, not just the walls of the campus but posters are stuck on everything
 sin board bhi poster se dhank jate hai
 In view of this, they are cleaning the campus
 ve dusu ke dauraan or dusu ke baad bhi apana no poster party campan jari rakhenge
 The students studying in the campus garbage DU are also not pleased
 aise main kai chaatr dusu chunaav ko boycott karne kii bhi taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Let us tell you that DUSU elections are to be held on 12 September

 lekin siyaasi halchal abhi se tej ho chuki he
 The BJP has spread polarization on Malda violence by awakening it from the Central Government to the Rashtrapati Bhavan
 sattadhari dal trinmul congress ko kadi takkar dene kii ranneeti ke tahat vam morche ke netaa purv mukhyamantri buddhadev bhattacharya ne saarvajanik taur par congress se gathjod kii vakaalat kar di
 But in 2011, the Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee, in West Bengal, a stronghold of CPM for three and a half decades, overthrew the 'poribortan' storm, the BJP, which formed the first majority government at the Center, was also 'poribortan' in 2015
 The dream of doing the same charisma has been cherished by raising the slogan of new change against
 iske peeche bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kii yah soch he ki modi ke sattanaseen hone ke baad badlaav kii jo lahar bah rahi he, usamen mishan bengal ahm kadi he
 Shah believes that the real victory of the party will be when the saffron flag is hoisted in Bengal
 34 saal bana 39 saal'poribortan' noi patan, or 34 saal bana 39 saal
 These two slogans will be the main points of bjp's campaign for the West Bengal assembly elections to be held after two months
 isamen bijepi yah kahegi ki 34 saal tak lagaataar shashan karne vaali vampanthi sarkaar ne soobe ko vikaas se maharoom rakhaa to 'poribortan' ke naam par satta main ai trinmul congress kii supremeo mamata banerjee kaa paanch saal kaa raaj bhi usee kadi kaa hissaa sabit hua he
 The BJP wants to emerge as an alternative to the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal by raising the slogan of new change against 'poribortan'
 philhal yah sthaan vam morche ke paas he
 BJP strategists aware of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's on-the-ground popularity in the state are assuming that the issue is going to be Mamata and her work in the assembly elections, so she will be challenged by BJP or Left Front
 darasal isi ke maddenjar bijepi kaa makasad mamata ke mukchay pratidwandvi ke taur par ubharna he
 The polarization attempt in Bihar may have fallen on the issue of beef in Bihar, but in West Bengal the BJP is once again looking towards polarization
 haalanki ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki pashchim bengal main bihar or uttar pradesh kii tarah sampradayikta ke aadhaar par hindu-muslim voton kaa dhruvikaran nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore, the party is moving forward on a soft Hindutva strategy, under which Mamata Banerjee is making the government's mess with national security an issue
 haal main 3 janvari ko malda ke kaaliyaachak main idara-e-sharia kii ore se yojit bheed ne jis tarah police thana, prashasnic bhawan par hamalaa kiya, use bijepi ne chunavi mudda bana liya he
 At first Shah sent a three-member committee to Malda, but Mamta Sarkar forcibly sent the team back from Malda railway station
 uske baad rajya bijepi ke prabharee mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey ke netritv main pratinidhimandal ne kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh or raashtrapati pranav mukherjee se milakar dakhal dene kii maang kii
 Not only Malda, BJP is going to raise issues like smuggling, illegal arms supply, fake currency in all such areas along the Bangladesh border, which the local people are suffering from
 hindu voton ke dhruvikaran kii ranneeti ke tahat simavarti jilon main sharnaarthi sammelan yojit karne kii ranneeti banaai gai he
 BJP national secretary and state co-incharge Siddharth Nath Singh says, "there is a difference between an intruder and a refugee
" bangladeshi sharnaarthiyon ko sangrakshan dene ke liye sansad main bill lambit he
 We will hold Refugee Conferences in the border districts from February 21 to 29
 '' in sammelnon main simavarti ilaakon main ho rahi avaidh gatividhiyon ko sangrakshan dene kaa aarope mamata sarkaar par lagaaya jayega or use gherne kii koshish kii jaaegi
 However, in the recent Global Business Summit held in Kolkata on 8-9 January, the manner in which Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, Energy Minister Piyush Goyal had praised the Mamata government, it created a dilemma in the local unit
 was
 baad main party ne malda kii hinsa ko jorshor se uthaakar damege control kii koshish kii
 Agenda versus development agenda: The BJP is assuming that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will be the main pivot of the election, but the real fight is to give her a tough fight for which the Left Front and BJP are competing
 shah ne pichley saal kolkata nagar nigam chunaav ke vakt victoria memorial ke nikat yojit jansabha main kaha tha, ''jaise modi ji ne congress mukt bharat kaa lakshya hasil kiya, vaise hi ab ham trinmul mukt bengal chaahate hai
 The public gave the CPM a chance, then brought change in 2011 by bringing Mamta, but what they did is well known
 ab janata bijepi ko mauka de taaki modi ji vikaas ke agenda ko rajya main aage badha saken
 "even though the BJP is claiming that Mamata is a strong alternative, but her difficulty is that Dr
 shyama prasad mukherjee ke baad bengal main party ke paas aisa koi cheharaa nahin hua jiske naam ko bhunaaya ja sake
 The party wants to make inroads in Bengal by taking the initiative to make the secrets related to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose public
 lihaaja party ne bina kisi chehre ke chunavi samar main utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 Siddharth Nath Singh says, "the people of West Bengal have to choose whether they want a face (mamta) or Narendra Modi's development agenda
" ''is naare ko buland karne se pehle bijepi ne mamata ko gherne kii pukhta ranneeti taiyaar kar lee he
 On issues of corruption like law and order and the Saradha chit fund scam, BJP will put Mamata government in the dock
 sutron ke mutabik, sharada chitfund maamle kii jaanch kar rahi sibiai chunaav se pehle gatividhi badha sakati he
 If the CBI clamps down on some Trinamool leaders who are under suspicion in this case, the BJP will try to take a psychological edge before the elections
 iske alaava kanoon-vyavastha ke maamle main police-prashasan par hamalaa, vishvavidhyalayon main chaatro-prophessoron kii pitayee, kisaanon kii durdasha jaise mudde bhi party ke agenda main he
 Rahul Sinha, former state BJP president and national secretary, says, "we are reaching out to the people directly, the people of Bengal have understood the reality of the Mamata government
 noujvaan samaj rahaa he ki bijepi hi behatar vikalp he
 Our slogan will be that if there is a single party government at the center and the state, then the state will grow rapidly
 ''ubharne lage nae samikarnavidhansabha chunaav kii sargarmi badhate hi soobe main nae siyaasi sameekaran bhi ubharne lage hai
 The BJP has become cautious on behalf of the CPM as a sign of closeness with the Congress
 haalanki bijepi kaa maananaa he ki agar vam morcha-congress kaa gathbandhan hota he to iskaa phayda bijepi ko milegaa kyonki muslim vot bant jayega
 On the other hand, from the time of 34 years of Left Front rule, the animosity of the workers of both parties is deep, who will not be able to accept this alliance
 bihar chunaav se pehle bhi bijepi ke ranneetikaar aisi hi daleel dete the jab lalu or nitish ke bich vilay / gathjod kii pahal ho rahi thi
 But the grand alliance was overtaken in Bihar by adding to the vote percentage found in the Lok Sabha elections
 bengal main bhi agar vam-congress kaa gathbandhan hota he to donon kaa vot share 39
 64 percent is what the Trinamool Congress votes 39
 79 fisadi ke kareeb pahunch jaataa he
 So 17 in the Lok Sabha elections
 02 fisadi vot hasil karne vaali bijepi kaa bengal main number do tak pahunchane kaa sapana adhuraa rah jayega
 The bjp's strategy for 2019 on the pretext of the assembly is that the BJP is trying to establish its foothold in Bengal, but according to senior BJP strategists, the party will contest the assembly elections with full force despite clear projections about the results
 sutron ke mutabik, bijepi ko bengal main jo badhotaree loksabhaa chunaav ke baad dikh rahi thi, usamen kami dikh rahi he
 This was confirmed by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation election results
 november 2014 main jab amit shah bengali bhashaa sikh khud nagar nigam chunaav ke prachaar main utre to unhen ummid thi ki vidhansabha kaa semifinal maane jane vaale sthaneey chunaav main party ko vam morche se zyada seatan milengi
 But when the results came out in April 2015, the Trinamool Congress won 114 seats against the last time of 95 seats out of a total of 144, while the Left Front came down from 33 to 15 seats
 bijepi kii siten 3 se badhkar 7 tak pahunchi, lekin vah number do party nahin ban pai
 Hence BJP formulated a long term strategy for Bengal
 bijepi vidhansabha chunaav main siton se zyada vot pratishat badhaane ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 The reason for this is the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ke ranneetikaron ke mutabik, apane aadhaar vaale kshetron main party behtareen pradarshan kar chuki he jahaan ab kuch badaae kii gunjaaish nahin he
 Therefore, the party is in search of a new stronghold so that it does not have to be denied the power of the Center in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 party kaa maananaa he ki abhi se bengal main party jameen tak pahunch jaae to uskaa sidhaa laabh aam chunaav main milegaa
 The fact is that the BJP got more votes in the Lok Sabha in Bengal in the same circles where people from up-bihar or Hindi-speaking states who went to do wages or business are more and there was Modi wave at that time
 sanghathanaatmak aadhaar badhaane kii koshishbhale bijepi ke paas zyada ummidavaar nahin hai, lekin rajya ikai ne pradhanmantri modi se 10 raily karaane ke liye samay maang liya he
 a strategy is being chalked out by dividing the state into seven clusters from the point of view of elections
 boothon ko teen shrenee main baanta gaya he—pehle main kareeb 60 hajaar booth he jahaan party 10-15 kaaryakartaaon kii team hone kaa daawa kar rahi he
 While the situation is weak at the remaining 14,000 booths, which are considered to be hyper-sensitive and Muslim-majority
 bengal aisa rajya he jahaan board parikshaon kii vajah se puure ek maheene tak mike-laudspikar par pabandi rahati he
 That is why the BJP has started the election in January with four big rallies
 farvari main party kaa puraa jor sanghathanaatmak taiyaariyon par hoga
 There will be a booth conference from 11 February to 20 February which will include state-district level leaders along with central leaders
 jabaki 21 se 29 farvari tak vidhansabhavar sammelan honge
 The election notification is likely to be issued in the first week of March
 siton ke lihaaj se party ne teen shrenee banaai he
 Out of 294 seats, 165 a are 45 b and rest 84 seats are in c category
 loksabhaa chunaavon main party ko 26 vidhansabha main badhat mili thi, jabaki kareeb 60 siton par najdiki mukaable main pichad gai thi
 In Bengal, rigging is very common in elections, so the party is talking to the Election Commission to apply VVPAT (print confirming votes) technology to all seats
 hinsaki ashanka se bijepi ne har vidhansabha main sahaayta ke liye ek legal team bhi gathit kar di he
 Obviously, the BJP has nothing to lose in Bengal
 kuch siten bhi hasil karke bijepi ke paas sanghathan vistaar karne kaa mauka he
 The question is whether
 bijepi apane mansoobey main kaamyaab ho paaegi? a 72-year-old RTI activist was shot and killed from close range in Santa Cruz

 It is important to remember that the one family who ruled the country for 48 years cared about the country - our government has done courageously to bring people stranded abroad to safe house - by finishing the interview in Group c job Poor youth have got opportunities - our government has started programs like Skill India, Standup India - more than 20 crore LED bulbs have been distributed under UJALA scheme, Getting a saving of Rs 16 thousand crore Why ever did not appear to Congress that is being driven by alienating the door of poor bank? Why Congress has never seen that even the poor have life, they too need life insurance, accident insurance - Jan Dhan, 80 thousand crore rupees saved through Aadhaar and mobile phones - we are spending not for relationships but for the country - the number of Naxalite affected districts in the country has come down from 136 to 90 - 100 percent neem coating of urea It has gone, farmers' expenditure on agriculture has come down - we have worked to curb inflation, while Congress failed in it - time for getting passports was reduced, time for return was reduced - procedures
 To be over 1400 law creating complex we have in the past four years working to empower the poor and how long we have to wait for the infrastructure, It should be received by all - 1 crore people in the country have been linked to Atal Pension Yojana - 1
25 billion bank accounts were opened under Jan Dhan Yojana - now almost every family has a bank account - 4 crore women under Ujjwala scheme Gas connection has been given for free - 10 crore new LPG connections have been given in the last four years - till independence, till 2014 about 6 crore toilets were built in the country - 40 percent of the people in the area of sanitation It was, but now this scope has been 80 percent - our government is not running from any Janpath but with public opinion - the northeast was not even taken care of, so this part of the country fell behind - by announcing these political schemes, it was a mistake Go - four former chief ministers are in jail because of the ongoing investigation against corruption - because of this situation, these parties never thought that all houses should have toilets, roads, everyone should have houses - Cars with everyone, -jab desh main kamitment vaali sarkaar chalati he tabhi sargical strike hota he
 - When there is a government of confusion in the country, action is taken against benami property

 —A former Prime Minister told India Today (july 9, 2003) that if the aforementioned former Prime Minister, who was high in corruption in the government, would have been shot, perhaps the tainted IAS couple of Madhya Pradesh would have shot Arvind joshi-tinu Joshi

 Believed, heaps of currency from home, but so far no one has been able to spoil their hair
 ab bhi ve sarkari kothi main thaath se rah rahe hai or partiyaan de rahe hai
 Despite being found guilty at every step, the Joshi couple is leaving no stone unturned to save themselves
 kendriya carmik or prashikshan vibhaag (diopiti) ne to 30 agast ko hi 1979 batch ke in afasaron kii barkhaastagi ke liye hami bhar di thi
 The final decision on the dismissal of both is now to be taken by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)
 aise main ab ve ayog ko prabhavit karne ke tareeke talashne main jute gaye hai
 In an income tax raid in February 2010, the couple illegally earned Rs 360 crore
 kii sampatti kaa pataa chalaa tha
 The couple are making full efforts to ensure that the matter somehow hangs for the next nine months and the time comes for them to retire
 ve barkhaast kiye jane ke apmaan se bachanaa chaahate hai
 They do not mind that during the past years, they retire while suspended with wrongly accumulated wealth

 There are discussions that he has close relations with some influential politicians and business houses

 jaanch main aise sanket mili ki 1999-2004 ke bich raksha mantralay main sanyukt sachiv rahete hue arvind joshi ne rishi kii pahunch mantralay tak karai
 This was the time when the Vectra group got the deal to supply the light helicopter

 naavlekar ko saunpi 7,000 pannon kii report main iskar vibhaag ne is baat kaa puraa byora diya he ki joshi dampati kaa paisa kahaan-kahaan laga he
 According to the report, the Joshi couple had made large-scale purchases of farming and un-cultivated land in Raisen, Balaghat, Sehore and Bhopal, including Kanha and Bandhavgarh National Parks
 unhone 25 flats bhi kharid rakhe the, jinamein se 18 to guwahati kii kamrup houseing socity main hi the
 He had six flats in Bhopal and one flat in Delhi
 report main daawa kiya gaya he ki 2007 se 2010 ke bich arvind ne share bazaar main satoria gatividhiyon or vaayada kaarobaar vagairah main 270 karod ru
 Had kept in logon ko barkhaast karne kii prakriya us vakt shuru hui jab madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko saunpi gai nirmala buch kii report se ek baar phir yah saaf ho gaya ki iees dampati ne aay se adhik sampatti jamaa kar rakhi he
 The state government recommended his dismissal on 23 January 2013 from the dopt
 lekin aisa karne main mukhyamantri chouhan ne acha-khaasaa samay liya
 On October 18, 2012, he had announced the dismissal of the Joshi couple
 tab shivaraj ne daawa kiya tha ki rajya sarkaar kii ore se iees dampati kii barkhaastagi kii sifarish 'jald hi’ centre sarkaar ko bhej di jaaegi
 But it took two months for the state government to make this recommendation to the dopt
 ab jabaki joshi dampati khud ko bachaane ke liye edi-chotii kaa jor laga rahe hai, aise main yah kahana mushkil he ki maamle ko taarkik nattejey tak pahunchane main kitna vakt lagegaa
 The mp's Lokayukta office, which occupied his property in cases of corruption of clerks and peons, is helpless to this IAS couple
 deree ke liye jimmedaar koun?yah vaaki hairaan karne vaali baat he ki itani sari agenciyon ne joshi dampati kii gheraabandi to kar di lekin ve in donon ko sajaa nahin dilaa saki hai
 The Lokayukta police raided the official residence of Joshi couple on December 10, 2010 but it took them more than 18 months to complete their investigation
 jaanch se jude ek adhikari kehete hai, ''hamane to apni jaanch 16 july, 2012 ko hi puri kar lee thi
 On October 8, 2012, the Lokayukta police sought permission from the dopt to prosecute the influential couple under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), but did not get permission for long
 jaahir he ki centre sarkaar is maamle main teji nahin chaahati thi
 "we are awaiting permission from the Center for action against the Joshi couple," says Ashok Awasthi, IG of Lokayukta police
 ” diopiti ne haal hi main iees dampati kii barkhaastagi kii file par dastakhat karte hue ise upiessi ko bhej diya he
 Now the Lokayukta police also hope that now they will get the right to prosecute Joshi couple soon
 idi ne joshi ke khilaaf mani landring nirodhak adhinium (piemele) ke tahat abhi karrwai shuru nahin kii he
 An income tax official says in anger, "I don't understand why the ED people are afraid to prosecute the couple?" But the ED has its own arguments
 uske ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, ''sab kuch aaropapatr par nirbhar karata he
 We can take any action only when a challan is presented against them in court
 jaise hi lokayukta police aaropapatr daakhil kar detii he, ham joshi ke khilaaf maamla darj kar lenge
 We have given her six crores in the state under PMLA
 kii sampatti to jabt kar hi rakhi he
 According to the official, a case will be tried against him under Section 3 of PMLA, which has a minimum sentence of three years and maximum of seven years

 Therefore, we have started action under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA)

 Babus have realized that their decisions can make other people rich

 Along with the physical needs of the administrative service, the needs of every leader have also changed, who cannot win an election without spending 100 times more than the Election Commission's limit
 ve yah paisa kahaan se or kaise pate hai? babu log iskaa rasta banaate hai
 Leaders and babus maintain this policy of mutually definite and continuous development
 joshi dampati ke ab tak barkhaast nahin hone kii sambhavat: yahi vajah he
 According to sources close to the investigators, the IAS couple earned more than the brokerage in the deals
 4 farvari, 2010 ko jab iskar adhikariyon ne chapa maaraa, us samay vinamr or mridubhashi arvind rajya ke jal sansaadhan vibhaag main pramukh sachiv the
 On the other hand, some ambitious Tinu by nature was the Principal Secretary in the Women and Child Development Department of Madhya Pradesh
 in donon hi vibhaagon ke paas vikaas se jude dheron kaam the or isse judi baari rakam bhi
 Arvind was Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Defense in Delhi before coming to the Water Resources Department in MP, where he allegedly amassed considerable wealth from brokerage
 jal sansaadhan vibhaag main pramukh sachiv rahete hue unhone share bazaar main motaa paisa lagaaya
 Similarly, Tinu allegedly earned big money from brokerage while living in the state Women and Child Development Department
 thekedaar badi pariyojnaayen hasil karne ke liye unke ghar par line lagaae rahete
 The Lokayukta found in his investigation that Tinnu would give the contract to whomever he wanted
 jin thekedaaron ko ve nahin jaan rahi hotin, unke dastavej main kami nikaalane ke liye khub magaj maratin
 The couple also invested heavily in the name of their son Ishaan

 Had invested crores in the name of Joshi also
 padhai ho, naukari yaa phir bhrashtachar, har jagah unhone nibhaayaa saservind or tinu donon 1954 main paidaa hue the
 Both were in the same batch of IAS
 vinamr arvind ko tinu se pyaar ho gaya tha, jo thodaa aakraamak swabhaav kii thim
 Both have an MBA degree from the same Australian university and are going to retire next year
 lekin sambhav he ki sevanivritti se pehle hi unhen seva se barkhaast kar diya jaae
 Arvind left the Air Force due to injury
 iske baad ve iees adhikari bane or 1981 main jabalpur ke assistant colector ke rup main apana kariyar shuru kiya
 Kayal Arvind was appointed as Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Defense from May 1999 to May 2004 to keep himself fit
 jab unke ghar par chapa padaa to ve donon aise vibhaagon main pramukh sachiv ke pad par the jo kendriya or vishwa bank jaisi videshi agenciyon se mil rahi athaah dhanrashi se labalab rahete hai
 Regular temple-going religious Tinu also started his career as Assistant Collector (assistant Collector) of Khargone in 1981
 unhone july, 1988 or janvari, 1990 ke bich pradhanmantri karyaalay main up-sachiv ke rup main kaam kiya
 Both have lived a high profile lifestyle, given parties, gone to expensive hotels and spent a lot of money on air travel
 lekin ghar par pade chaape ke baad tanhaai main din guzaar rahe dampati ke paas ab milane-julne waalon kii bheed nahin hoti
 Some contractors come, who used to come to them from work earlier
 pehle ek-duusare ke saath khush rahane vaale is jode main daraar pad chuki he kyonki kareebi logon ke mutabik, tinu is apmanjanak sthiti kaa sara thikra apane pati ke sir phodtii hai or khud ko nirdosh bataati hai
 In contrast, her husband Arvind remains calm, introducing Dheeraj
 arbapati dampati ab bhi bhopal ke 74 bangalon vaale ilaake main apane sarkari nivas di-19 main deraa jamaaye baithe hai
 Both of their children are in the US, so both often go abroad
 aae din party dene kii unki aadat gai nahin he
 The difference is that now on such an occasion, the big people do not seem to have gathered like before
 kai mitron or karibiyon ne unase duuri bana lee hai
 When contacted on behalf of India Today, both did not talk about these topics
 haalanki arvind ne yah kehete hue apane yaa apni patni se jude kisi bhi maamle par kuch bhi bolne se parhez kiya ki abhi yah sab adaalat main vichaaradhin he, isliye koi tippanee nahin kar sakate
 Finally, in 2007, 'troubles' started raising heads for the Joshi couple
 bijepi ke purv vidhayak narendra birthere ne lokayukta police main unke khilaaf shikaayat kii, jisamen arvind par shivpuri jile main nahar pariyojna main 360 karod ru
 Was accused of doing a scam
 unki shikaayat par maamla darj kar liya gaya tha lekin majboot rajnatik samparkon kii badaulat arvind kaa bal bhi baankaa na hua
 However, after two years the couple faced a big problem
 iskar adhikariyon ko pataa chalaa ki unhone beemaa policiyon main bade paimaane par nivesh kar rakhaa he
 Tax officials kept a close watch on insurance agent Seema Jaiswal and finally wrapped up Joshi on February 4, 2012
 ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki is bhrasht dampati ke khilaaf karrwai main rajya or centre sarkaar kii tarah hi upiessi bhi susti hi dikhaata he, yaa fori karrwai kar mukadmaa chalaane or giraftaar kaa maarg prashast karata he

 cricket hamaare desh main dharm kii tarah he, or khilaadiyon par hameshaa achche pradarshan kaa dabaav bana hi rahata he, lekin ab team india ke khilaadiyon par yah dabaav kuch or badhane ke asaar dikhaai de rahe hai
 
 
 According to information received by sources quoting NDTV India, now the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will conduct annual contracts with only those players who play a key role in the team
 
 
 bataaya gaya he ki bisisiai aane vaale dinon main 'e', 'bi' or 'si' ke bajaae sirf do hi grad 'e' or 'bi' rakhega, or iske saath hi in gradon ke tahat anubandhit kiye jane vaale khilaadiyon kii sankhya bhi pehle se kam kar di jaaegi
 
 
 So, frankly speaking, now the work of the players in the new system will get attention, not the name
 
 
 philhal, 'e' grad main anubandhit khilaadiyon ko ek karod rupee salanaa die jate hai, or is grad main sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag, mahendra singh dhoni, gautam gambhir, yuvaraj singh, jahir khan jaise khilaadi shaamil hai
 
 
 The 'B' grade players get Rs 50 lakhs annually, and this grade currently includes players like Harbhajan Singh, Cheteshwar Pujara, Rohit Sharma, Irrfan Khan and Umesh Yadav
 
 
 tisare grad 'si' ke tahat anubandhit kiye gaye 20 khilaadiyon ko philhal 25 lakh rupee salanaa die jate hai
 
 
 According to sources, the BCCI is now planning to give a total of 20 players to the annual contract
 
 
 bataaya gaya he ki darasal, board kaa maananaa he ki zyaadaatar khilaadi indian premier lig (ipel) kaa hissaa hai or unhen apane team maalikon se acchhee-khaasi rakam milti hi he
 
 
 So, if the players get out of the graded payment list, they will work harder to improve their performance in the team by improving their performance
 
 
 vaise jahaan ek ore teen se do grad kiya janaa kuch khilaadiyon ke sir par gaaj banakar gir saktaa he, vahiin ab anubandhit kiye jane vaale khilaadiyon ke liye ek khushkabari bhi he
 
 
 According to sources, this time the players who are in 'A' grade can be given Rs 1
5 crore instead of one and the contracted players in 'B' grade can be given Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore instead of 50 lakh
 
 
 tippaniyan The new grading system will probably be stamped at the annual meeting of the BCCI to be held in Chennai
 
 
 vaise, sutron ke mutabik nae system kaa board kii tijori se kuch lenaa-dena nahin, balki yah is baat kii koshish he ki khilaadi lagaataar mehnat karen, or top par bane rahen
 
 
 On the other hand, now we will mention those players whose leave is almost fixed
 
 
 maujuuda anubandhon ke tahat kai aise khilaadi shaamil hai, jinhone pichley ek saal main team india ke liye ikkaa-dukka match hi khele hai, so, unki chuttee tay he, kyonki ab bisisiai khilaadiyon ko di jane vaali salanaa qaraar kii rakam par kanchi chalaane, or sirf unheen khilaadiyon ko apnaane kaa man bana rahaa he, jinka balla lagaataar bol rahaa ho, yaa jinaki gendon se vipakshi ballebaaj dol rahe hon
 
 
 The players whose names are being decided from the grading list may include players like Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel, Laxmipathy Balaji, Yusuf Pathan, Robin Uthappa, s Badrinath and Praveen Kumar
 
 
 philhal, 'e' grad main anubandhit khilaadiyon ko ek karod rupee salanaa die jate hai, or is grad main sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag, mahendra singh dhoni, gautam gambhir, yuvaraj singh, jahir khan jaise khilaadi shaamil hai

 On the other hand, now we will mention those players whose leave is almost fixed
 
 
 maujuuda anubandhon ke tahat kai aise khilaadi shaamil hai, jinhone pichley ek saal main team india ke liye ikkaa-dukka match hi khele hai, so, unki chuttee tay he, kyonki ab bisisiai khilaadiyon ko di jane vaali salanaa qaraar kii rakam par kanchi chalaane, or sirf unheen khilaadiyon ko apnaane kaa man bana rahaa he, jinka balla lagaataar bol rahaa ho, yaa jinaki gendon se vipakshi ballebaaj dol rahe hon
 
 
 The players whose names are being decided from the grading list may include players like Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel, Laxmipathy Balaji, Yusuf Pathan, Robin Uthappa, s Badrinath and Praveen Kumar
 
 
 sutron ke mutabik, bisisiai ab kul 20 khilaadiyon ko hi vaarshik qaraar dene kaa man bana rahi he
 
 
 It has been reported that in fact, the Board believes that most of the players are part of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and they get a significant amount from their team owners
 
 
 so, agar khilaadi graded pement list se baahar ho jaaenge to apane pradarshan main sudhaar kar ve team main apni jagah pakki karne ke liye zyaada kadi mehnat karenge
 
 
 While a grade of three to two may fall on some players' heads, there is now a good news for the players to be contracted
 
 
 sutron ke anusaar, 'e' grad main shaamil khilaadiyon ko is baar ek kii jagah dedh karod rupee or 'bi' grad main anubandhit khilaadiyon ko 50 lakh ke sthaan par 75 lakh se lekar ek karod rupee tak kii rakam di ja sakati he
 
 
 The comments bisisiai kii chennai main hone ja rahi salanaa vaarshik baithak main is nae grading system par shaayad muhar lag jaaegi
 
 
 By the way, according to sources, the new system has nothing to do with the board coffers, rather it is an attempt to make the players work hard, and stay on top
 
 
 udhar, ab zikr karenge, un khilaadiyon kaa, jinaki chuttee lagbhag tay maani ja rahi he
 
 
 Under the current contracts, there are many players who have played only a few matches for Team India in the last one year, so their leave is fixed, because now the BCCI is going to scissor on the annual contract amount given to the players, And only the players are willing to adopt, whose bat is constantly speaking, or whose balls the opposition batsmen are drooling
 
 
 jin khilaadiyon ke naam grading list se katane tay maane ja rahe hai, unamem virendra sahvaag, gautam gambhir, irfan pathan, munaf patel, lakshmipathi balaji, yusuf pathan, robin uthppa, es badrinaath or praveen kumaar jaise khilaadi shaamil ho sakate hai
