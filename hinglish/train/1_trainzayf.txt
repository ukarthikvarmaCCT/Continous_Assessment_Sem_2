 As soon as GST knocks on July 1, there is going to be a tax congestion everywhere and the TV industry will be affected

 According to sources, it is difficult to tell the effect of GST on the cost of production cost or stars but the equations will be cleared only after one month
 vaise tex ke teen bracket hai or industry ke logon kii koshish yahi rahegi ki zyada tex chalaa jaae to waapas aa jaayegaa lekin kam nahin bharaa janaa chahie
 At the same time, if sources are to be believed, the increase in production cost can also have an impact on the salary of TV actors and they can be scissored
 kya he GST bilbharat main aam nagarikon par do tarah ke tex lagate hai- pratyaksh kar or apratyaksh kar
 Income tax and corporate tax etc
 are direct taxes
 vahiin bikri kar or seva kar ityadi apratyaksh kar hai
 Through the 122nd Amendment Bill in the Constitution, only one tax - Goods and Services Tax will be imposed from July 1, 2017, replacing all indirect taxes levied in the country

 During this period, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, however, seemed to indicate his ambition to become Prime Minister as he compared his party's government in Uttar Pradesh to the governments of other states including Narendra Modi's government in Gujarat
 unhone sapa shasit uttar pradesh main kriyanvit vikaas yojanaon ko soochibaddh karte hue kaha, kya aisi yojanaayen gujarat main kriyanvit ho rahi hai

 Significantly, Yadav's party is supporting the central government from outside, pointing to the 2G case, saying that the Congress 'cheats' him, which supports him
 ullekhneey he ki 2ji maamle main dramuk mantri e raja ko aaropee banaakar jail bhej diya gaya tha
 The SP chief said, Karunanidhi supported the government
 unki party sarkaar main bhi shaamil thi, lekin un logon ne unki party ke mantri ko hi fansaaya or use jail bhej diya
 They (congress) betray those who support them

 BJP MP Balbir Punj had insisted that the government will not complete its tenure and mid-term elections are inevitable
 balbir punj ne kaha, pradhanmantri chaahe jo bhi kahen, lekin tathy yah he ki desh main sarkaar ko lekar asthirataa kaa vaataavaran he
 That's why itane log madhyavadhi chunaav kii baaten kar rahe hai
 He said, this government has lost the confidence of the people to rule and there is also doubt about its number in the Lok Sabha
 desh philhal purna asthirataa ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 The SP chief denied the possibility of going with BJP, saying that all others can join hands with him, SP will never join hands with BJP
 iskaa koi sawaal hi nahin uthta
 JDU chief Sharad Yadav dismissed the possibility of the SP withdrawing support from the government, saying the SP chief had expressed such displeasure earlier as his vote bank was anti-congress
 rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) ke sanyojak yadav ne kaha, vah (mulaayam) hriday se congresvirohi hai, lekin gat nau varshon se utpann raajnneetik sthiti main vah unke saath hai
 He still won't leave them
 vah kuch bhi nayaa nahin bol rahe hai
 He has said all this in the past as well
 main nahin maanata ki vah us seemaa (samarthan vaapasi) tak jaaenge
 The Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs, Rajiv Shukla, while rejecting the possibility of mid-term elections, said that the elections would be held in 2014 as scheduled
 shukla ne sapa pramukh kii tippaniyon kaa mahatv kam karte hue kaha ki yadi koi matbhed he to use dur kiya jayega, kyonki mulaayam singh yadav ‘‘hamaare mahatvapurn sahyogi’’ hai
 The comments congress pravaktaa sandip dikshit ne kaha ki chunaav april yaa may 2014 main honge jab bhi nirdhaarit hoga or sarkaar apana kaarykaal puraa karegi
 Dixit said, let them speak what they say

 lekin yah kehane se pehle ki koun dhokheybaaj he yaa nahin yaa koun vikaas kaary karaata he yaa nahin logon ko unke ricard dekhne chahien
 Reminding Yadav in Dixit said, if he had been running a good government in Uttar Pradesh, he would have a record of re-forming the government there
 kisi ne bhi us rajya main sarkaar nahin dohraayi jabaki congress kam se kam do rajyon main dobaaraa satta main chuni gai he
 When the government is re-elected it becomes clear who does better

 ''bhaajapa ke varisht netaa ne kaha, ''yah sachaai he ki ham aam chunaav main lage is bade jatke or uske kaarnon ko kam kar nahin aank sakate
 But at the same time i would also like to emphasize that the BJP is not the party that indulges in mutual accusations and counter-allegations after electoral setbacks
 '' unhone kaha ki ham sangharsh main ek rahe or sangharsh kaa nateeja bhale hi kuch bhi rahaa ho ham ek rahenge
 The nature of democracy itself is that defeat and victory are its part
 adwani ne kaha, ''chunaav nateezon kaa ek pahalu yah bhi he ki haar kii ghadi main aksar ham use bahut badha-chadhaakar pesh karte hai lekin jis tarah haar ko kam kar nahin aankna chaiye usee tarah ise badha-chadhaakar bhi pesh nahin karnaa chahie
 In a parliamentary party meeting, Advani accepted the mandate of this Lok Sabha election in favor of the Congress and the UPA, congratulating Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi for this

 shahari vikaas mantralay, gujarat ke adhikari apni filon ke saath baahar intjaar kar rahe hai, kyonki mukhyamantri narendra modi kii cabinet kii sabase taqatvar mantri, 71 varshiya anandiben patel kisaanon se sambandhit nitiyon par rajasav vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke saath baithak kar rahi hai
 The meeting is taking place in the huge chamber of Patel in Swarnim Sankul-1, the grand building of the ministry

 After all, they are for the public only
 niyamon kaa istemaal is tarah hona chahie taaki unase janata ko phayda mili
 Therefore, following the rules, solutions to problems are also necessary
 ” vah adhikari sahmati ke bhav main lagaataar sir hilaataa rahata he
 The influence of Anandiben Patel can be understood
 shahari vikaas or rajasav vibhaag ke alaava unke paas sadak or bhawan vibhaag bhi he
 Despite Modi being out of the state for most of the last two months, the functioning of the government has been going on smoothly
 mukhyamantri modi ne iske liye apane vishwast logon ko kaam par laga rakhaa he or ve apane uttardaayitv ko bakhubi nibhaa rahe hai
 Modi is seen handling files with Anandiben and Minister of Power and Industry Saurabh Patel whenever he returns to Gandhinagar after visiting various parts of the country
 gandhinagar main satta ke galiyaaron main modi ke uttaradhikari ko lekar gahan charchaa ho rahi he
 No one knows when Modi will announce him, because right now his attention is on the Prime Minister's chair
 lekin sabhi kii nigahen ahmedabad ke mohiniba kanya vidhyalay kii purv pradhanacharya anandiben par lagi hui hai jo ve apane kade anushaasan or kaarykushalta ke liye mashhoor rahi hai
 Modi has known Anandiben since 1988, when she joined the BJP and participated in a program demanding justice for the famine victims
 1995 main shankar singh waghela ne jab baghawat kii thi, to us kathin daur main anandiben or modi ne saath-saath party ke liye kaam kiya tha
 His image is completely impeccable so far and he lacks experience either
 1998 main cabinet main aane ke baad se ve shiksha or mahila evam bal kalyaan jaise mantralayon kaa jimmaa sambhaal chuki hai
 Anandiben, the finest speaker of Gujarati language, is seen as a strong leader in the assembly and always outshines the opposition
 unki sabase badi yogyata yah he ki ve nidar or saahsee hai
 In 1987, she jumped into the lake to save a student from drowning, for which she was also awarded the Bravery Award from the state
 party ke sutron ke mutabik unamem ek hi kami he ki “ve hansmukh nahin hai
 And the party does not treat friendly workers
 ” lekin anandiben kahati hai, “jo log niyamon kaa paalan karte hai, unhen dostana vyavhaar vaala nahin mana jaataa he, khaas taur se un logon kii najar main jo nijee phaaydon ke liye aate hai
 i should judge by my actions, not by my face
 ”anandiben ke bare main jo atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai, ve niraadhaar nahin hai
 He is seen as a working leader whom Modi can fully rely on
 ve kaam ko adhuraa nahin chhodtin or faislon ko lagu karne kii ichhashakti rakhti hai
 Modi is deeply impressed by his quality
 1998 se 2007 tak primary shiksha vibhaag kii mantri ke taur par unhone adhyapakon ke liye tabadalon or niyuktiyon kii nai vyavastha taiyaar kii thi or is tarah rajya main shikshakon ke tabadalon or niyuktiyon ke udyog ko lagbhag khatm hi kar diya
 Earlier, middlemen used to earn big money as bribe in transferring teachers

 Under this program, thumbprints and photographs of 52 percent farmers of Gujarat have been computerized
 baaki bache 48 pratishat kisaanon ke liye jameen ke saude tehseeldaar ke daftar main webacam se record kiye ja chuke hai
 Anandiben is now using satellite images to prevent disturbances even in urban planning

 Officials of Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam (SSNN) say that due to their quick decision-making ability, the land acquisition work has accelerated since 2008
 is samay narmada kii 38 up naharon main se 37 kaa kaam puraa ho chukaa he, jabaki 2008 main yah sankhya mahaj 15 thi
 The reason for this is that they gave compensation to the farmers according to the Jantri (manual of fixed price of land), which was much higher than the normal rate
 anandiben kii prashasnic samajhadaari ne unhen mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaaron main sabase aage pahunchaa diya he
 But he also has some rivals
 unamem se ek hai, vitt mantri 56 varshiya nitin patel, jinka patel jati or sangh parivaar main kaaphi prabhaav he
 Apart from him, 54-year-old Saurabh Patel is also named, who is an English-speaking face in the Modi government

 He has been the Finance Minister in the first two terms of Modi

 Be creative - One of the advantages of traveling is that you get creative ideas

 Able to solve problems - For some time, a person feels relieved by going away from home and either forgets his troubles or starts to feel less troublesome
 jisase pareshaani kaa samaadhaan aap relax hokar aasaani se nikaal sakate hai
 DDA has decided to allow its flat holders to get their flat free hold
 didie ke mutabik jin logon ne kanvarjan kii prakriya ko puraa kiye bina hi registerd agreement tu cell yaa general power of atorni ke jariye apana flats bech diya tha unhen inkaa laabh milegaa
 But for this, they will have to pay around 66 percent surcharge in addition to the conversion fee
 iske alaava shart yah he ki ye registerd agreement tu cell 24 sitambar 2001 se 11 oktober 2011 ke bich register hona chahie
 After that, the flats taken on the Agreement to Sale will not be covered under this scheme
 didie ne yah kadam shahari vikaas mantralay ke nirdesh par liya he
 DDA sources say that for flats which do not have GPA or Agreement to Sale register, this scheme will also be there, but the condition is that the Agreement to Sale or GPA is before 24 September 2001

 daure ke duusare din modi ne singapore ke raashtrapati tony taan keng yam se mulaakaat ke baad vahaan ke piem ke saath bhi dwipaksheeya vaarta kii
 During this time all issues of bilateral importance were discussed
 donon deshon ke sheersh netaaon ke bich dwipaksheeya baatcheet main vyapaar or suraksha, taskari samet kai ahm muddon par charchaa hui
 Defense cooperation, shipping, civil aviation, urban planning, cyber security, prohibition of trafficking in narcotic drugs, cultural exchange were agreed upon
 nae railmantri kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke baad somvaar ko suresh prabhu ne kaha ki rail suraksha or upabhokta seva unki praathamikta hogi
 He also talked about utilizing the capacity of railways in the true sense
 mantralay kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke baad prabhu ne kaha, ateet main hamane railway ke sanchaalan main kaaphi chunautiyon kaa saamana kiya he
 We have capacity, which is not utilized properly
 shivasena chhodkar bhaajapa main shaamil hone ke kuch hi der baad kal cabinet mantri ke rup main shapath lene vaale prabhu ne sadanand gauda kaa sthaan liya he
 Gowda has been entrusted with the Law Ministry in the reshuffling and expansion of the Council of Ministers
 prabhu ne kaha, pradhanmantri ne faisla kiya he ki sthiti (railway kii) ko badalanaa hoga
 
 hamaare do kendriya vishay honge, jisamen upabhokta seva or railway suraksha hogi, kyonki yatriyon kii suraksha chintaa kaa vishay banataa ja rahaa he
 Referring to expressing great confidence on behalf of the people in the government, he said that the steps to be taken in the railways on their behalf will be seen in the coming time
 unhone kaha, ham jo karenge, vah aane vaale samay main dikhaayi degaa, isliye koi ghoshnaa nahin kii jaaegi
 Prabhu said that the economy also depends on the railways
 unhone kaha ki railway arthvyavastha kaa abhinn hissaa he or ''agar ham is disha main kaam karenge tab aarthik vikaas ko badha paaenge

 The political betting of Gujarat once again became bjp's name
 rajya kii siyaasi ranbhumi main bijepi chunaav main utari to vijay roopaani kaa cheharaa sabase aage tha, lekin chunavi nateezon ne unhen peeche kar diya he
 Although the BJP is going to hold the throne of power for the sixth time by hoisting the victory, but for the first time in the last 22 years it has failed to cross the 100-seat mark
 isiilie bijepi roopaani ke vikalp ke taur par mukhyamantri ke chehre kii talash kar rahi he or roopaani kuch khulkar nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Let us tell that in the 182 assembly seats of Gujarat, BJP has gone to 99, Congress alliance to 80 and 3 others
 is baar ke chunaav nateezon ne bijepi kii jeet ko feekaa kar diya he
 If the bjp's victory was very strong, perhaps Rupani would have got the CM ticket again
 lekin ab unki dagar kathin dikh rahi he or siem kii res main kai chehre dikhne lage hai
 These include Nitin Patel, Smriti Irani, Purushottam Rupala, Mansukh Bhai Mandaviya, RC Faldu and Vajubhai Vala
 bijepi ke is abhedya durg ke singhaasana par koun baithegaa, ye paanch factor tay karenge
 2019 Lok Sabha challenge: BJP has to chew Nako gram to save its strongest stronghold Gujarat
 bijepi ne chhathvin baar jeet hasil kii lekin pehle se 16 siten kam hui hai
 bjp's prime minister and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will this time put someone in Gujarat who has the ability to strengthen the organization and who has the ability to repeat the previous record in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 pichhali baar bijepi ne rajya kii sabhi 26 loksabhaa siten jiti thim, lekin vidhansabha chunaav main congress kaa graph or siten badi hai
 BJP is restless with him
 aise main bijepi alaakaman soobe main aise shaks ke haathon satta kii chaabi saunpna chaahati he, jo bijepi ke abhedya durg ko barkaraar rakh sake
 Strong leadership: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah will no longer be able to spare much time for Gujarat in the upcoming elections
 aise main party rajya kii satta ke singhaasana haathon main dena chaahati he, jo majboot netritv de sake
 After Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, the power which was handed over to Gujarat has not been able to give strong leadership
 aise main bijepi apane abhedya durg main aise chehre kii talash kar rahi he, jo party kii badshahath ko na sirf barkaraar rakhe, balki aage bhi badha sake
 Ethnic Equation BJP has been successful in winning Gujarat elections, but its caste equation has been breached
 jaateey sameekaran saadhane ke liye bijepi apane puraane faisle main badlaav kar sakati he
 The state wants to hand over the reins of power to such a person who can keep the bjp's traditional vote bank Patidar and OBC united
 aise main bijepi ke liye obisi ke chehre ke taur par vajubhai vaala jabaki patidaar ke rup main mansukh bhai mandavia do pramukh chehre hai
 Regional Balance: The BJP is looking for a face that can maintain a balance between all the regions of Gujarat
 bijepi gramin kshetron kii tulana main shahari siton zyada jeetne main safal rahi he
 Congress has done better in Saurashtra to South Gujarat and rural seats
 aise main bijepi soobe kii kaman aise haathon main saunpna chaahegi, jo shahari or gramin donon ke saath-saath saurashtra or baaki ke kshetron ke bich santulan banaakar chal sake
 Maintaining the laboratory of Hindutva, Gujarat was established by the BJP as a laboratory of Hindutva and has remained on the throne of power for the last two decades
 congress ne bijepi ke durg ko bhedane ke liye soft hindutv kii raah apanaai he
 Congress has also got a big benefit
 aise main bijepi ke saamne apane is durg ko bachaae rakhane ke liye hindutv brands vaale netritv kii jarurat hogi
 In such a situation, power can be handed over in the hands of a person who has come out of the courtyard of bjp-sangh
 apni bebaaki ke liye jane jane vaale filmkaar anuraag kashyap ne twitor chhod diya he
 Anurag Kashyap has also tweeted and deleted his account, informing his parents about the unknown phone calls and threats received by the daughter
 anuraag kashyap un hastiyon main se hai jo saamaajik muddon par soshal media par mukhar rahete hai
 Anurag Kashyap tweeted, 'no one would want to talk when your parents start getting calls and your daughter starts getting threats online
 koi vajah yaa koi bhi tark nahin bachegaa
 The domineering will rule and the new way of living the bullying
 sabko nayaa bharat mubarak ho or aap isamen rah saken
 May you have happiness and progress
 ye meraa aakhri twit hoga kyonki main twitor chhod rahaa hum
 i will not speak when i cannot speak without fear
 good by
 However, Rahul Ishwar, who calls himself a Hindu activist, said that it is very sad that Anurag Kashyap deleted his Twitter
 yah loktantr ke liye dukhad or bura he jab ham bina dar ke apni raay nahin jaahir kar sakate
 i disagree with Anurag Kashyap on 99% of the issues, but his right to say is our responsibility as a nation
 Very sad that Sri Anurag Kashyap deleted his Twitter
 It is sad & bad for democracy when we cant voice our opinion with out fear

 com / guwxp80ta6— Rahul Easwar (@rahuleaswar) August 10, 2019 Please tell that Anurag Kashyap tweeted on the decision of the Central Government to remove Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 anuraag kashyap ne kashmir par sarkaar ke faisle ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa naam liye bina nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Anurag had also expressed his position to be confused about the decision on Kashmir
 anuraag ne twit main likhaa tha, unhen sarkaar ke faisle par virodh se kahin zyada faisla liye jane ke tareeke se dar lag rahaa he
 Anurag tweeted back to back three about Kashmir
 unhone likhaa, Article 370 yaa 35A, ke bare main main zyaada nahin kah saktaa
 Its implication, history, or facts i still have not understood
 kabhi lagata he janaa chahie tha, kabhi lagata he kyon gaya
 Neither i am a Kashmiri Muslim, nor a Kashmiri Pandit
 meraa kashmiri dost kahata he kashmir kii kahani Roshomon kii tarah he
 Anurag Kashyap wrote, Kashmir has many aspects
 sabhi sahi hai or sabhi galat
 i just know that the way in which all this happened was not right
 unhone likhaa, pataa he daraane vaali baat kya he, ye ki ek aadmi sochataa he ki 1,200,000,000 logon ke laabh ke liye kya behatar he, use maaloom he, use apni shakti kaa istemaal karne kii acces he
 This tweet by Anurag Kashyap was directly pointing towards PM Narendra Modi
 is twit ke baad anuraag dakshinpanthiyon ke nishane par aa gaye
 After heavy trolling, Anurag retweeted and wrote that he did not understand article 370 but the way it was removed was wrong
 isse pehle linching ko lekar pradhanmantri ko patr likhane waalon main naam hone kii vajah se bhi anuraag kashyap ko troling kaa shikaar hona padaa tha
 Mario Mandjukic, who became the 'noor-e-nazar' of Croatian football fans by scoring the winning goal against England, learned the football title not in his country but in Germany

 mandjukik ke gol se pehali baar final main kroeshia, france se hoga muqablamadejukik 2005 main enke jagareb team main shaamil hue or chelsi tathaa manchester united jaise bade klbon kii najar main aae
 The forward, who played for German club Bayern Munich, was part of Atlético Madrid and currently plays for Juventus
 apni aakraamakata or maansik dridhtaa ke liye kochon kaa chaheta rahe mandjukik dabaav ke kshanon main gol karne main maahir hai
 He also scored an equalizer in the final-16 match against Denmark, after which the match was drawn for extra time and Croatia later won in the penalty shootout

 sieji keval bharat sarkaar ke pratinidhi ke taur par aariel or petroleum mantralay ke bich hue qaraar ke mutabik jaanch kare
 This means that the CAG cannot put its report in Parliament nor can it be made public
 2
 The CAG should not scrutinize ril's previous years ie 2003-04 and 2007-08
 iskaa matlab ye he ki aariel kii maang he ki kharch main badhottaree ko lekar sieji koi sawaal naa khadaa kare
 3
 sieji 2008-09 se 2011-12 kii vittiya jaanch ko pichley maamalon se naa jode
 This means that the investigators did not include the expenses incurred in the past years in the list of further expenses
 4
 And finally RIL insists that the justification of expenditure should not be questioned during the financial investigation
 iskaa matlab ye he ki sieji kii agar koi phijulkharchi najar aati he to wo us par tippni naa karen
 In its reply to RIL, the CAG has written - The scope of the audit will also include the financial scrutiny and justification of the cost as the purpose of the audit is to analyze the cost shown in the documents from the point of view whether transparency is necessary while deciding prices and expenses
 Went and competitive process was taken care of

 ' Did Muslim organizations take out a rally in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh after the Congress victory, shouting slogans in support of Pakistan? Also demanded to rebuild Babri Masjid? Such claims are being made on social media by quoting a video
 fasebuk par aisi hi ek post kaa sheershak diya gaya he- 'yah lo congress kii jeet ko abhi 24 ghante bhi nahin hue hai ki babari masjid ke liye juluus or pakistan ke naare lagane lage

 It can be seen in the video that people have taken placards bearing the picture of Babri Masjid and are raising slogans for its reconstruction
 hamane sanbhal main muslim lig ke jila adhyaksh mukeem-ur-kuraishi se baat kii
 He said, on 6 December every year marches for the reconstruction of Babri Masjid
 uparokt video usee virodh march kaa he lekin ye video is saal kaa nahin he
 The Babri Masjid was demolished on 6 December 1992
 kuraishi ne jor dekar kaha, ‘babari masjid giraae jane ke baad se ham har saal is tarah kaa march nikaalte rahe hai
 Neither did we ever raise slogans in support of Pakistan nor did this march have anything to do with the recent victory of the Congress Party

 chhattisgarh ke korba se bijepi saansad bansilaal mahato ne rajya kii ladakiyon ke liye aise shabd kaa istemaal kiya, jise lekar mahila sanghathan khaase naaraaz hai
 Mahato took the name of Chhattisgarh Sports Minister Bhaiyalal Rajwade, saying that he often said that the need of the girls is no longer from Mumbai and Calcutta, the Turi of Korba and the girls of Chhattisgarh have become tanned
 mahato somvaar ko jila kushti sangh kii ore se urjaadhani main yojit dangal ke udghaatan kaarykram main bol rahe the
 Mahato said, “we also invite outside wrestlers in our region
 aaj sabase badi khushi kii baat hui he
 This thing is taken jokingly
 hamaare khel mantri bhaiya laal ji rajavaade aksar ye baat bolaa karte hai ki ab baalaon kii jarurat bombai or kalakatta se nahin he, korba kii turi or chhattisgarh kii ladkiyaan tanaton ho gai hai
 This may be a joke perhaps
 lekin abhi jo jogi ji ne aahvaan kiya he unka main samarthan karata hum
 Should every person of Korba, our women of Chhattisgarh come forward
 chhattisgarh kii berogari dur honi chahie
 What he has praised for Korba is definitely worth appreciating
 ”bataa den ki kaarykram main mahato se pehle marvaahee vidhaybomit jogine sambodhit karte hue mahila shashaktikaran par jor diya tha
 The intent with which Mahato made this statement, but the use of the word 'tantan' for girls, is being condemned everywhere
 amit jogi ne kaha ki mahato kaa bayaan bahut hi durbhagyapurna he, unhen apni umr kaa to lihaaj karnaa chahie tha
 Mahato's statement has provoked girls and women's organizations in the state
 unki maang hai ki mahato ko is bayaan ke liye maafee maangani chahie
 Let me tell you that a year ago the BJP had found it difficult to respond to the actions of his son, who was referring to the statement of Sports Minister Bhaiyalal Rajawade of Mahato State
 rajavaade ke bete ne korba main ek kaarykram ke dauraan baar baalaon ke dons ke dauraan jam kar note udaae the

 The Pakistani soldier missed the target and he (rocket or missile) exploded on the hill behind Gunjan and his aircraft

 Sambit Patra is a Brahmin himself and the Puri seat is also Brahmin dominated
 is loksabhaa seat par bijepi kabhi nahin jiti he
 Similarly, Achuthanand Samant, MP from Kandhamal, has been named as Chief Whip of the BJD in Lok Sabha and Anubhav Mohanty, MP from Kendrapada has been named Deputy Chief Whip

 But on the go, Baghdadi has come down to such a savageness that his attacks have once again caused the innocent movement of Iraq
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki iraqi fouj ko khud ko bachaane ke liye bagdadi ke aatankwaadi ab aam shahriyon par hi rasinic hathiyaaron se hamale karne lage hai? in rasinic hamalon kii vajah se log ghut-ghut kar or tadap-tadap kar mar rahe hai
 The one who was in awe is after all
 jab aatank ke aakaa bagdadi ko laga ki iraq se ab uskaa hukka-pani uthne vaala he, to usne jaise na jienge or na jeene denge kii kasam kha lee
 Has started writing the script of Mahatbahi in Iraq
 is tabaahi kii pehali kisht bagdadi ne mosul ke begunaah logon ke naam bheji he
 For the first time, pictures of this great tragedy are also coming out
 iesas ke aatankiyon ko ab jab puraa yakeen ho chalaa he ki iraqi phujon ke hamale se unka batch paanaa mumkin nahin he
 The world is not afraid of Baghdadi and its terrorists
 duniya ko ab in bam dhamaakon se bhi zyaada khatara mahasoos nahin hota he
 Rather, the world is getting frightened by that new threat called chemical weapon
 bagdadi kaa ye sabase ghaatak hathiyaar kitna khatarnaak he uskaa andaja bhi nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 From Mosul, such reports are becoming common now that after the terrorists who are carrying out the blast, there are strange pictures and effects
 dhamaake ke baad sab barbaad ho ja rahaa he
 According to a report by the eirakiwebsite Alsumaria, ISIS militants fired three rockets loaded with deadly chemical mustard in the Qayrah area off Mosul
 iske dhamaake main 7 log buree tarah jhulas kar mar gaye, jabaki 5 saal ke ek bachche kaa jism buree tarah jal gaya
 He is currently undergoing treatment at the hospital in Irbil
 bachche ke gharavaalon ke mutabik rocket ke dhamaake ke baad ajeeb si gandh mahasoos hui
 The people who came in its JD started feeling jealous in their body
 rocket unke ghar ke nazadik gira tha
 The United Nations has already issued a warning for terrorists to use chemical weapons in Mosul
 itnaa hi nahin yuan ko puraa andeshaa he kiaisake paas mustard gas, ammonia or sulfur jaise khatarnaak rasayanon kaa zakhira he
 With which they can cause havoc
 rasaynic hathiyaar se itnaa khauf isliye he kyonki ye pal bhar main hi hajaaron–lakhon logon ko maut kii neend sula detaa he
 If someone somehow survives, then he is forced to die of suffocation due to diseases
 chemical vepan khatarnaak isliye bhi he kyonki jab tak logon ko is zahreele hamale kaa andaaza lagata he tab tak kaaphi der ho chuki hoti he
 While Baghdadi has started targeting innocents with its chemical weapons in Iraq, it has also collected a stock of poisonous things in its occupied city of Mosul, which in the presence of bombs and gunpowder, melt millions in the air
 Can make people sleep in death
 mosul ko chaaron taraf se gher lene ke baavjood philhal iraqi fuj apana har qadam phoonk-phoonk kar rakh rahi he
 Be a responsible citizen - stay safe, keep the skies safe

 ' Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party of instigating communal riots in Muzaffarnagar last month for electoral gains, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said at an election rally in Indore on Thursday that the city of Uttar Pradesh riot-affected Muslim youth to be tricked by the Pakistani intelligence agency She is trying
 indore ke dashahra maidan main congress kii 'satta parivartan' raily ko sambodhit karte hue rahul ne kaha, parason mere daftar main ek bhartiya guptchar adhikari aayaa
 He told me that people of the Pakistani intelligence agency have started talking to 10-15 Muslim boys of Muzaffarnagar, who have been killed in the riots
 bhaajapa ne rahul ke bayaan par kaha he ki rahul gandhi kaa yah kahana ki sampradayik dangon ke shikaar pariwaron ke yuvaaon ko pakistani agenciyaan aatanki gatividhiyon main shaamil hone ke liye chaara daal rahi hai, ek tarah se musalamaanon kii deshbhakti par andeh karne jaisaa he

 He should apologize for his comments

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi had said that the Indian intelligence officer told me that he was explaining these riot-affected boys of Muzaffarnagar not to get into the words of the people of Pakistani intelligence agency
 rahul ne kaha ki jab vah mujffarnagar ke danga prabhavit logon se mili, to un logon ne unhen bataaya ki is shahar main dangon kii aag jaan-boojhkar lagaai gai
 The Congress vice-president said, BJP felt that without communal fighting in Uttar Pradesh, their talk would not be made, so they set fire to riots there
 unhone (bhaajapa netaaon ne) isaki chintaa nahin ki yah aag koun bujhaayega or isse desh kaa kitna nuksaan hoga
 On the claim of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi about contacting some Muslim youths of Muzaffarnagar riots by the Pakistani intelligence agency, the Uttar Pradesh Police has said that it will investigate it

 About three months ago, underworld don Dawood Ibrahim gets the news that his biggest enemy is Chhota Rajan in Australia
 di-company ko ye khabar kahin or se nahin balki khud chota rajan ke ek gurgey se milti he
 After this, Dawood's special warrior Chhota Shakeel reaches Australia with his shooters
 ab chota-rajan kii jindagi or maut ke bich bas kuch hi ghante baaki the ki tabhi rajan ko khud par hone vaale hamale kii bhanak lag jaati he
 According to an Intelligence Bureau report, Chhota Shakeel has been living in Karachi with Dawood Ibrahim since the 1993 Mumbai blasts
 yahi di company kaa sabase khaas sipahasaalar hai
 And this is what has taken Dawood Ibrahim's biggest betel nut
 supaari daaud ke sabase bade dushman chota rajan ko thikaane lagane kii
 The latest story of the enmity of two underworld friends who are now known enemies is revealed
 kahani chota rajan ko australia main uske khufia thikaane par thikaane lagane kii
 But just a few hours before this happened, all the d Company's poll was opened and Chhota Rajan got another chance to escape
 15 saal pehle yani san 2000 ke baad di company duusari baar chota rajan ke bilkul kareeb pahunch gai thi
 It was just a matter of hours
 australia main di company ke shooter bhi pahunch chuke the
 Chhota Shakeel himself was monitoring the entire operation
 lekin ain maukey par rajan ko di company ke is hamale kii jaankaree mil gai
 And he managed to escape
 isi saal april maheene ke duusare hafte kii baat he
 Indian intelligence agencies were constantly intercepting the phones of Dawood Ibrahim and his special operatives
 tabhi achaanak ek roj khufia agency ne phone par chota shakeel kii aawaaj suni
 He was talking to some unknown person
 donon main jo baatcheet ho rahi thi ye thi
 Shakeel: Shakeel is speaking
 
 
 anjaan shaks:salaam valekum bhai!shakeel:valekum salaam
 And all the well? Unknown man: Brother! Shakeel: Hey where is this maternal grandfather hiding nowadays? Unknown man: Brother, i don't know brother
 shakeel:wo ham ko galat bataa ke khud ko bada desh bhakt bataata he
 Last time also he survived for a little but this time he will not be sure
 tu sirf itnaa bataa de ki wo kahaan chupa hua he? tu sirf ek baar madad kar
 What you want, you say! Unknown man: No brother, i don't want anything and i do not know where the maternal grandfather is! Shakeel: See, your benefit is only in coming to this side, so he (nana) will keep running from here to there
 tu hamako madad karegaa to tera khyaal main rakhuunga
 After listening to this conversation, it was clear that d Company had made a dent in Chhota Rajan's camp
 rajan kaa koi gurga rajan se hi gaddari karne ko tauyar ho chukaa he
 But in this conversation, the Indian intelligence agency could not find out the whereabouts of Rajan's whereabouts
 magar chota shakeel isame kaamyaab ho gaya
 He had come to know about Chhota Rajan's whereabouts
 chota rajan australia ke new kaisal shahar main rah rahaa tha
 Since the news was confirmed, this time d Company did not want to make any mistake
 bainkak kii naakaami unke jehan main ab bhi taaja thi
 Therefore, this time Chhota Shakeel himself took the responsibility of setting up Chhota Rajan
 khufia agency ke mutabik phone intercept se pataa chalaa ki shakeel april ke tisare hafte se lekar agle ek maheene tak apane original passport par pehle america or phir australia gaya
 In the US, he stayed at the house of a very close relative
 america se australia aane ke baad wo sadak ke raste bas se new kaisal shahar pahunchaa
 Chhota Rajan was reported to be in this city
 shakeel new kaisal main ek hotel main ruk kar vahiin se rajan kii rekki karne ke alaava hamale kii sajeesh bun rahaa tha
 For this, some of his shooters had also reached Australia
 magar hamale se kuch ghante pehle hi kisi tarah ye khabar chota rajan tak pahunch gai
 He immediately shifted his base to New Castle and went underground
 agenciyon kii maane to underground hone ke baad rajan australia chhod chukaa he

 unhone rauf ahamed ke naam kii sifarish bahaduree puraskaar ke liye kar di he
 Can a daughter win a prize? Can anyone give a daughter in reward? What a stupid question you would say
 par yakeen maniye pakistani tivi ke ek reality sho main jeetne waalon ko inaam main betiyaan di ja rahi hai
 In every episode of this Pakistani TV show, a girl is placed in the cradle as a bumper prize and the winner is given the trophy like a trophy
 duniya main apane tarah ke is sabase anokhe sho ne puri duniya main hadakamp machaa diya he
 The show's host Amir Liaquat Hussain is distributing the prize as unclaimed daughters who are thrown on the garbage heap to the winless couples who won the game show
 pakistan main jaise hi yo sho shuru hua, pakistan samet puri duniya main khalabali much gai
 It was for the first time in the history of TV game show that a girl was being given in prize
 is sho ke ab tak chaar alag-alag episod aa chuke hai or chaaron episod main chaar vijeta beaulad jodiyon ko chaar bacchiyaan inaam main di chuki hai
 The name of this most famous show in Pakistan is Aman Ramzan
 darasal, is game sho ke do pahalu hai ek acha ek bura
 Let us tell you about both the aspects of this game show, before that know what this game show is really about? This game show started in the wake of Ramadan, about 7 hours from morning time till morning
 Is being telecast
 iskaa maqasad logon ko sahari or aftaar karne ke sahi vaqt or sahi tareeke ko bataate hue unhen interten karnaa he yani imphotonment ke concept vaale is sho main logon ko kuran or ramadan kii ahmiyat bataate hue unase savalat kiye jate hai
 The winners of the show were rewarded with items such as cars, autos, tvs, fridges, mobiles and laptops, but the biggest jackpot is to give a baby girl to the prizeless couples
 aamir liyakat ke bare main parkistan main mashhoor he ki wo apane shoj ko is tarah se pesh karte hai ki tiarapy record tod aati he
 In Pakistan, the month of Ramadan is considered very important in this regard
 yahaan ramajaan ke maheene main zyaadaatar log gharon main rahakar ibaadat karnaa pasand karte hai or aise main tivi channelon main tiarapy kii khatir jang chhid jaati he or phir shuru ho jate hai tiarapy kamaane ke nae-nae stant
 When a couple found a child, they were happy
 mahila ne kaha, 'yakeen hi nahin aa rahaa tha ki hamen ye bacchee di ja rahi he, main bahut khush hum
 The man said, 'at first we were not complete, this girl came and completed us
 is bacchee ke aane se hamaare ghar main raunak ai he
 The host of the show, Aamir Liaquat Hussain, said that the show consists of those who are helpless
 aise logon se kai sawaal kiye jate hai
 Then finally the couple is called to whom the baby is to be assigned
 jode ko live tivi par bacchee tohfe ke rup main di jaati he
 a voice against the show, is this show a noble attempt to bring the parents of unclaimed girls to their shadow? a good initiative to adopt unruly couples? Or the game of collecting trps by distributing destitute girls as prizes? This new trick of Pakistani TV show has made the show famous overnight, but more things are happening against the show than what is being done in favor of this show
 bacchiyon ko god dene ke is tarah ke tareeke par ab sawaal uth rahe hai
 Not only in Pakistan but also in the whole world
 duniya bhar ke akhabaaron or bevasits par is sho ko lekar bahes chhid gai he
 'the spectacle is not good like this' it started with Pakistan
 pakistan ke ek bade enjio idi foundation ke anwar kaazmi ne is sho par sawaal uthaate hue kaha he ki bacchon ko is tarah se tivi sho main god dena thik nahin he
 If it has to be done then it should be done silently, it should not be made a spectacle
 is tarah live sho main bachche or god lene vaale maa-baap kii pahchaan saamne laane se aage kaaphi dikkat hogi
 Not only the parents but also the children will have to bear the taunts of the society, which is not right at all
 is sho kaa virodh kar rahe logon kaa kahana he ki kisi bhi desh main bachche ko god die jane se pehle maa-baap kii acchhee tarah se jaanch padtaal kii jaati he
 The investigation starts from the orphanage and reaches the police
 jaanch main pataa lagaaya jaataa he ki joda bachche ko maa-pita kii jimmedaari sambhaal paaegaa yaa nahin
 But the question is, on whom are the parents chosen in the channel? We are working well: Even after the show Hostamam protests, Dr
 Liaquat Hussain, the anchor of the show Aman Ramadan, finds it all right
 unka kahana he ki ye sab tiarapy batorne ke liye nahin kiya gaya he, balki iske peeche nek makasad he
 He said, 'our show is already number one in terms of ratings
 ye bachche na to kooda hai or na hi bekaar kii chijen hai isliye hamane inhen koodaydaan se uthaakar ek jaruratmand danpati ke hawaale kiya he
 There is nothing wrong in this
 ham pakistan main logon ko anaath bacchon ko god lene ke liye prerit kar rahe hai
 'pakistan's law is one of the reasons behind the protest; Pakistan's law is also a reason behind the protest of this show
 yahaan kanoon is tarah se bacchon ko god lene kii ijaajat nahin detaa he
 So the couple may have to knock the court door to become legal guardians of the girls
 bhale hi dampatti ne bacchee ko le liya he, lekin in donon ko lambii ladaai jari rakhni pad sakati he
 Both of them will be considered as parents of this girl only after being legally granted
 artical 15 film ko lekar vivaad khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 The film has been opposed since the trailer's release
 kai brahman sanghathanon ne aarope lagaaya ki film main unki chhavi dhoomil kii gai he
 After this, director Anubhav Sinha has been threatened on phone and email
 jab film relies ho chuki he to police vaale theatre main film kii screening roak rahe hai
 a video of this is going viral on social media
 is video ko film ke diarector anubhav sinha ne apane twitor acount par share karte hue madad kii guhaar lagaai he
 Sharing the link of the video, Anubhav Sinha wrote, "will anyone do anything?" Any journalist? Any politician? Any officer? "the video shows the audience sitting inside the theater but the film is not playing
" parade ke saamne kai police vaale khadey hai
 Many in the audience are saying, "why have you stopped the picture?" '' koi bol rahaa he ''sar ye to galat he
 "during this time many people are also raising slogans of Jai Bhima
 koi kuch karegaa? koi patrkaar? koi rajaneta? koi adhikari???https: / / t
 co / sfkfjhriku — Anubhav Sinha (@anubhavsinha) June 29, 2019 Notably, Anubhav Sinha had earlier written an open letter on his Twitter account for those opposing the film
 iske madhyam se unhone bataaya tha ki yah film kisi bhi tarah se kisi bhi samudaay kaa virodh nahin karti he
 He wrote, "my greetings to all the Brahmin organizations of the country
 saath hi karani sena ko bhi
 Also, through this letter, i also forgive all those members of you who have violated the limits of disagreement and protest
 meri hatya yaa meri bahanon or meri divangat maa ke balaatkaar kii dhamkiyon se samvaad nahin ho saktaa
 "I believe that most of you will not face this type of opposition
 sabase pehle main aapako ye samajha duun ki kisi bhi film kaa trailor uski puri kahani nahin kah paata
 Is not possible
 film ke bahut se tukdon ko jodakar ek aakarshak kahani bataane kaa prayaas hota he
 The probability that any film will attempt to disrespect any society is slim

 1
 offis jaldi aane kii aadat daalen: ek baat samaj len ki offis main der se aane vaale logon ko kabhi bhi pasand nahin kiya jaataa
 So get in the habit of coming to office early
 agar jaldi nahin aa sakate to samay par aane kii koshish karen

 The company prefers employees who know and live up to the terms of the company
 job intervyuu main bhul kar bhi na karen ye 5 galtiyaan

 For example, going to office in slippers or half pants is considered against office decorations
 isliye offis ke liye hameshaa formal kapadon kaa hi chunaav karen
 Board Exam is close, manage your time like this 4
 intervyuu main dikhaaen rujhaan: intervyuu main yaa meeting main aapkaa rujhaan najar aana chahie
 It should be felt that you take the company seriously and every little thing matters to you
 job intervyuu se pehle fasebuk kii kar len safai, jaane kyon

 bolne se pehle sochen: offis ke sahakarmiyon or doston ke bich antar hota he
 So whenever you talk in the office, stop and think before you speak

 The special court, while awarding the case against Jayalalithaa for possessing more assets than the known source of income, said that all the expenses incurred in the grand marriage of her former adopted son Sudhakaran were borne by the former Chief Minister and it was around three crore rupees
 jayalalita ke mukhyamantri rahete hue 1995 main sudhakaran kaa vivaah hua tha
 There was a lot of controversy regarding the marriage, criticism over appearances, demonstrations and petitions were filed in the court

 ' vivaah kaa sara kharch dulhan paksh kii ore se kiya gaya tha, is daawey ko khaarij karte hue nyaayadhish ne kaha, 'uparokt sabhi tathyon or paristhitiyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah pushti hui he ki aaropee e-1 (jayalalita) dwaara e-3 (sudhakaran) ke vivaah par teen karod rupee kii raashi kharch kii gai
 ' nyaayadhish ne kaha ki sakshya bataate hai ki sabhi intjaam jayalalita kii ore se unke kehane par karaae gaye the or unka bhugtan bhi unhone hi kiya tha
 The prosecution said that an amount of six crores was spent on the marriage

 Jayalalithaa paid for all these arrangements
 rajya vidhansabhaon or loksabhaa ke chunaav ek saath karana prashasnic taur par sambhav he, basharte paryaapt vyavastha or tantra ho
 Political parties have not yet given any clear opinion on this
 haalanki ek sansadeey samiti, vidhi sansthaaen or niti ayog is prastaav par vichaar kar chukaa he or iske napha-nuksaan par gaur karke unki siforishein bhi aa chuki hai
 There are no two opinions in this, there are definitely some benefits of holding elections simultaneously
 ek to bharat jaise vishaal desh main rajya vidhansabhaon or loksabhaa ke chunaav alag-alag karaane main kaaphi samay or sansaadhan lagate hai or lagaataar rajyon ke chunaav karaane main samay, paisa or shram kaaphi kharch hota he
 Secondly, it is easy to monitor the behavior of political parties if elections are held at one go
 tisare, chunaav prakiya ke dauraan ek-duusare par nichle str ke vyaktigat hamale or chunavi hinsa kaa maahaul shuru ho jaataa he, use kuch hi samay tak simit kiya ja sakegaa
 Political parties have proved to be the weakest link in Indian democracy
 jitne adhik chunaav hote hai, ye partiyaan pratyaksh yaa paroksh taur par aakraamak rukh par utaaru rahati hai
 Above all, the issue of holding elections together for this one benefit is justified
 yani chunaav jitna kam honge, rajnatik partiyon ke liye ek-duusare par aakraamak hone ke maukey kam milenge
 This will make the atmosphere a little warmer in the country and will help maintain normalcy
 aakhir main rajnatik partiyon or chunaav ayog kaa kharch ek samay ke baad ghat jayega, jo asal main karadaataaon kaa hi paisa he
 However, initially the need for additional voting machines and workforce may increase considerably
 lekin beshak lambii avadhi main antat kharch kam ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the benefits of holding simultaneous elections for a long time in terms of political parties, expenditure and the necessary workforce will outweigh the disadvantages
 aakhir rajnatik partiyon ko baar-baar chunaav main jane ke liye kaaphi kharch karnaa hota he
 Due to the lack of elections, that expenditure will be reduced
 iske alaava chunaav ayog kii mad main bhi kharch kam ho sakegaa
 We will also be able to save a lot of money as it will cost less to prepare voter lists and may not have to be changed again and again
 ek saath chunaav karaane ke paksh main duusari daleel yah he ki chunaav saath hue to aachaar samhita kaa paalan karwaanaa aasaan hoga
 This does not mean that we can move towards holding elections simultaneously soon
 isamen sabase badi aadchan yah he ki hamaare samvidhan ke mutabik sattadhari party ke nirnay yaa phir avishvaas prastaav ke jariye hi sadan bhang ho saktaa he
 This means that until the term of the term of the House is not fixed, the plan to hold elections simultaneously at the Center and the State cannot be implemented
 iske liye samvidhan main sanshodhan karke sabhi sadanon kii avadhi tay kerani hogi
 The problem is particularly complicated in the case of smaller assemblies in the states of Goa, Puducherry and north-east, where the incidence of dissolution of assemblies is higher than in states where there are 200 or more members
 duusare, ek saath chunaav karaane ke prastaav kii aalochana kaa ek aadhaar yah bhi he ki isse hamaare samvidhan kii sangheey charitra par chot pahonchegi kyonki voter sthaneey yaa rajya ke muddon ko utana tavajjo nahin de paaenge kyonki rashtriya mudde haaavee rahenge, yah sahi nahin he
 It is also easy to argue that smaller parties will not be able to properly record their election presence
 yah bhi sahi nahin he kyonki hamaare paas khaskar odisha jaise rajya main vidhansabha or loksabhaa ke chunaav saath karaane ke anubhav hai
 Thirdly, it is also easy to argue that there may be more expenditure than holding elections together
 meraa anubhav bataata he ki rajnatik partiyon or chunaav ayog kaa kharch zyada hoga
 However, we will not achieve better democracy only by holding elections all over the country, if we do not make election reforms to get rid of the candidates from criminal background and to bring other laws to control political parties

 assam main baadh kii sthiti ab kaaphi behatar he
 But pictures and videos claiming destruction and relief operations in the affected areas on social media are still being shared indiscriminately on social media

 BJP MLA is also being praised on social media for this good work

 "the interesting thing is that while claiming to be a BJP MLA in the picture, it is being shared but it is not mentioned anywhere what the name of the young MLA is
" aise main tasviir kii pramanikta ko lekar kisi ke jehan main bhi sawaal aa saktaa he
 India Today's Fact Check team conducted an investigation to ascertain the identity of the alleged MLA along with the truth of the picture
 isi koshish main hamen aisi hi samaan tasviir haath lagi jo beete saal bhi share kii gai thi or use assam main baadh ke dauraan hi share kiya gaya tha
 The MLA was not even mentioned in that picture
 beete saal baadh par sthaneey reports se ye sanket mila ki tasviir main jis vidhayak ko dikhaaya gaya he wo mariyaani seat ke vidhayak rupajyoti kurmi ho sakate hai
 Now it is surprising that Rupjyoti Kurmi is a Congress MLA and not BJP
 jab vidhayak rupajyoti kurmi se sampark kiya gaya to unhone pushti kii ki tasviir main vahi hai or ye tasviir pichley saal khinchi gai thi
 Kurmi told India Today- 'yes, this picture was taken when i went to the relief camp set up in Lower Primary School, located in a tea estate in Bokakhat assembly constituency near Kanjiranga National Park
 mere saath khaane or raahat saamagree se laden 40 mini trakon kaa bedaa tha, kyonki mere dost is muhim main madad kar rahe the isliye sirf unheen se chaaval ke boron ko le jane ke liye kahana anuchit hota, isliye maine bhicampatak le jane ke liye kuch bore uthaae jinamein har ek kaa vajan 25 kilogram tha
 'MLA Roopjyoti Kurmi said that she is aware that her picture is being shared by the BJP MLA as a good work in flood relief
 kurmi ne kaha, ‘dekhie ye bijepi sarkaar he or unke netaa har tarah ke propaganda main lage hai
 It is no wonder that their workers are doing such work
 ’kurmi ke mutabik unhone sthaneey samachaarpatron main is dushprachaar ko rokane ke liye soochna prakashit karai lekin uske baad bhi ye harakatein jari hai
 Roopjyoti Kurmi's name recently came in the limelight when he was seen plowing his fields in Mariyani
 unhone nadi ke kinare tatbandh banane main bhi madad kii thi
 Viral test proved that the picture being shared on social media is real but the person seen in it is being misrepresented as BJP MLA

 But it does not show signs, the present government associates Gandhi and Gandhi's birthday with cleanliness
 gandhi jayanti ke uplakshya main sarkaar kii taraf se swatchta abhiyaan chalaae ja rahe hai
 To this, Rahi said, if you think about cleanliness, then the first task should be that the cleaners in the country should be provided such facilities, so that they do not have to go into the gutter and do the cleaning
