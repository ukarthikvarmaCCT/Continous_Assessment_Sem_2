 Vinod Rai said that CAG is not just for clapping
 sieji kii tulana munim ji se nahin kii jaani chahie: supreme courtsieji vinod raay ne kaha ki sieji ek sanvaidhanik sanstha he or yah sarkaar ke chiyarliders kaa role adaa nahin kar saktaa
 The CAG should be given more strength: Justice Suresh Gourt said that the CAG was openly criticized by several ministers in the government in the past, after the CAG gave a report on the coal block allocation
 sarkaar ke mantriyon ne report ko lekar sieji kii niyat bhi par sawaal uthaae the
 Hearing a public interest litigation by the CAG on the loss caused to the oil companies, the Supreme Court had reprimanded the government and said that the CAG was not just an accountant

 Three rebel mlas withdrawing support from the Karnataka government have been disqualified by Speaker Ramesh Kumar
 inamen nirdaleey vidhayak aar shankar bhi shaamil hai
 R
 shankar karnataka sarkaar main nigam prashasan mantri the
 He later resigned from the government and moved to Mumbai with rebel mlas
 jaankaree ke mutabik, aar shankar ne apni party kepijepi kaa congress main vilay kar liya tha
 R
 shankar ke alaava ayogy ghoshit hone vaale congress ke do baagi vidhayakon main ramesh jarakiholi or mahesh kumthalli kaa naam he
 The speaker disqualified two Congress mlas and one Independent MLA till the end of the term of the current assembly in 2023
 apane faisle main spikar ne kaha ki ve agle kuch dinon main baaki 14 maamalon par faisla karenge
 It is clear from the speaker that he is not going to take an immediate decision on the remaining 14 mlas as he made it clear in his press conference on Thursday that he would have to read a lot about the next step
 sabhi saakshyon par baariki se dhyaan dene ke baad hi ve koi faisla lenge
 The Speaker's point shows that if the mlas who resign do not disqualify, they will continue to be members of the Legislative Assembly
 karnataka main philhal, spikar ke str se twarit faisle na hone ke chalate abhi asamanjas kii sthiti bani hui he
 In such a situation, BJP is also adopting the strategy of 'weight and watch'
 kaha ja rahaa he ki pichhali baar jaldbaaji main sarkaar banaakar bhugat chuki bijepi ab phoonk-foonkkar kadam uthaane ke mood main he
 In such a situation, she will take time to present the claim
 aisi surat main karnataka main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii bhi prabal sambhaavnaaen najar aa raheen hai
 Talking about the strength, after the disqualification of 3 mlas, there were 223 mlas in the Assembly
 is lihaaj se bahumat kaa aankada 112 baithta he
 The BJP currently has 105 mlas
 use abhi or 7 vidhayakon kii jarurat hogi
 3 mlas who are disqualified can no longer come in bjp's favor as the Speaker has disqualified them till the end of the current term
 yah alag baat he ki supreme court yaa hoicourt main ye vidhayak apni ladaai jeet len or bijepi ko samarthan de den
 This is unlikely because the three-member bench of the Supreme Court had made it clear that the speaker had every right to take a decision on the rebel mlas
 is lihaaj se ayogy qaraar die gaye 3 vidhayak ab kahin ke na rahe, aisa maan sakate hai
 The strong signal of President's rule, the BJP has made it clear that it is in no hurry to meet the Governor and present the claim
 iskaa vaazib kaaran he kyonki use pataa he ki jaruri sankhyabal uske paas nahin he
 To form a government, the BJP is completely dependent on the Speaker taking a quick decision about the rebel mlas, but now it seems to be hanging in the balance
 aisi haalat main ab karnataka main kya hoga?iskaa jabaab bijepi ke karnataka pravaktaa ji
 Madhusudan has already given
 madhusudan ke mutabik, "agar vidhansabha adhyaksh baagi vidhayakon ke istife ko sweekaar karne yaa khaarij karne main zyada samay lete hai to rajyapal (vajubhai vaala) rajya main raashtrapati shashan kii sifarish kar sakate hai, kyonki is tarah kii sthiti main ham sarkaar banane ke liye daawa karnaa pasand nahin karenge
 "therefore, forming a government for the BJP seems to be a far-fetched proposition
 centre for public interest litigeshan ne supreme court main yachika daayar kar mobile toweron se nikalne vaale radiation kii thik se monitering karaane kii maang kii he
 The petition states that radiation emanating from mobile towers poses a risk of serious diseases
 supreme court ne is yachika par telecom vibhaag ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga he
 In the petition, a lot of international research was cited as the basis that the radiation generated from mobile towers can cause diseases like cancer, leukemia and Alzheimer's
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki bharat main mobile toweron se jo radiation nikalataa he wo antarrashtriya maanakon se 1 lakh guna zyada hota he
 Advisory is not being followed by the Department of Telecom and the Ministry of Environment has issued an advisory that towers should not be built around schools, hospitals but it is not being followed properly
 yachika main kaha gaya he kii sarkaar ke paas aisa koi maikenism nahin he jisase tay str se zyada radiation kii rokthaam kii ja sake
 Action can be taken against those who are violating it
 iske liye sarkaar ke paas jaruri mainpavar bhi nahin he
 According to the Supreme Court in 4 weeks, the respondent said, in 2011, the World Health Organization had said in its report that mobile phones could be a cause of brain cancer
 2014 main sansad kii standing cameti ne bhi telecom department ko kade shabdon main kaha tha ki desh main cellphone towers se nikalne vaale radiation kaa str pashchimi mulkon main tay maanakon se zyada nahin hona chahie
 The Supreme Court has sought an answer from the Department of Telecom in 4 weeks

 dilli sarkaar ne apane project par hone vaale kharch kaa ek bada hissaa is saal kharch nahin kar paa rahi he
 In the last budget, the Kejriwal government said to spend Rs 19 thousand crore on the scheme of different departments
 lekin bajet se ek hafte pehle yani 21 march tak 12 hajaar karod bhi kharch nahin kar pai he
 In the areas of education and medical, the budget has been much less than expected
 ek-tihaai rakam hi kharchakejariwal sarkaarne bajet se mili rakam ko puri tarah se kharch nahin kar pai he
 The government treasury should have been emptied at the end of this year
 lekin ab tak di gai raashi kaa takreeban ek tihaai hissaa bhi kharch nahin ho paaya he
 Many departments either did not start projects for their departments or when they started, it was too late

 Statistics of Delhi government show that till March 21, only 65 per cent of the budget has been spent for the schemes of different departments

 There are many disparities regarding pension
 Let us know that the final announcement regarding OROP is yet to be made
 sarkaar ne sitambar 2015 memhaushauf kii ghoshnakarne ke baad november 2015 main ise lekar notification jari kiya tha

 The court admitted that he had simply criticized the public figure in the street language

 Nor does there appear to be any hatred among them, but was again arrested after the NSA Board's decision
 har taraf is faisle kii aalochana hui he
 Language should be decent, but should one be locked up under the National Security Act for this? Then, on social media, how many people would have been imprisoned for making derogatory remarks towards Nehru, not knowing how many leaders and ministers would have been in jail
 mukhyamantri biren singh saarvajanik vyakti hai
 They will be criticized
 unki aalochana kii kya bhashaa hogi, yah kisi kanoon se tay nahin ho saktaa
 Bad language and violent language will always be criticized, but national security law will be used to correct this, it is not appropriate

 Should they be jailed for criticizing them and the Chief Ministers? Do you really think that due to the language of Kishore Chandra, the law and order of Manipur is threatened? Keep all these things in mind, otherwise all the doors of speaking will be closed and one day the doors of your house will be closed

 avinaash ne iske liye maafee maangane se inkaar kar diya he
 Language may be criticized, but should the police be involved in all these matters? There are so many slogans that go from kicking shoes to burning effigies, are they all crimes now? Then the police should carry handcuffs in every demonstration, wearing slogans
 uski hathkadiyaan kam pad jaaengi
 And if this is true, then why is this happening unilaterally, can the same police station in-charge file a case regarding the Chief Minister's language? The Prime Minister himself has spoken of kicking shoes at the crossroads during demonetisation
 juute maarane kii baat hamaari bhashaa kii saamanti or karaab viraasat he
 Because of this, will the case of disagreement be the case and police station? i am also opposed to the burning of the effigy, and also of kicking the shoes, but i am also against the fall of the police in this matter

 Do you know how many positions are vacant in all the colleges and schools in India and what is the economic and social condition of the contract teachers in their place
 kya aap tamaam nakli muddon ke ghamaasan main apane un shikshakon kii haalat ke bare main zaraa thahar kar sochna chahenge jin par aapke bacchon kaa bhavishya nirbhar karata he, jinke na hone se aapkaa bhavishya karaab hua he
 Those who distribute and make greeting cards in the name of Teacher's Day on September 5 also have no idea what the condition of qualified teachers of that day is
 ye haalat aaj se nahin he, magar ye haalat kal bhi thi, aaj bhi he or kal bhi rahegi
 The way teachers are hired in India, the situation is the same in America
 bharat main theke par rakhe jane vaale asthaayee shikshakon ko alag-alag naam se bulaate he
 These lecturers are kept in Colleges under the names Adhawk, Guest, Contractual, Temporary
 america main inhen Adjunct, Indenture kehete hai
 Everyone who teaches in college in India is called a professor
 america kii uniwarsity ke prophessoron kii badahaali par 2013 tak report ai thi
 On September 30, another horrific report appeared in the Guardian
 prophessoron kii garibi kii report
 The poverty of a woman lecturer who taught temporarily took her into the world of sex worker
 course padhaane kaa lod kam hua to paise or kam ho gaye
 Even after many attempts, when she did not get the money to spend, she broke down
 vah class main sabake saamne naam or chehre ke saath padhaati hai magar duniya ko apni yah takalif bataane ke liye naam or chehre ko chhipaana padataa he
 In order to teach a new generation, their commitment to developing understanding is so deep that they are unable to separate themselves from the work of teaching
 vaise har kisi ko doosraa kuch or kaam itani aasaani se miltaa bhi nahin
 It may be that the case of a lecturer in the world of sex workers is an exception, but everything is not an exception
 yah sahi he ki vahaan asthaayee yaa theke par padhaane vaale professor agar ek kamai ke dam par sammanjanak jivan nahin ji pate hai
 Now for many years, reports are being written and surveys are being done on the poverty of professors
 ek report ke anusaar, america ke collejon main 60 se 70 fisadi professor ab theke par rakhe jate hai
 According to the course, you get salary which is very less
 haalat ye he ki bahut se professor beghar hai, kiraaye ke chote se makaan main rahete hai
 Some live on the sidewalk and some have made the car their home
 bhojan or ilaaj ke liye sarkari sabsidi kii yojana par nirbhar rahete hai
 Go to church and eat and then teach in class
 hafte main 60-60 ghante padhaate hai, phir bhi kamai puri nahin hoti he
 Out of class, they run ola-uber taxis
 vahaan ke shikshakon ke paas khaane kii aarthik shakti nahin hoti, to ve maance ke khurchan, chikan kii haddiyaan or santare ke chhilake se khaanaa taiyaar karne kii racippi rakhte hai
 The recipe for cooking in the world of temporary teachers is also different
 vahaan ke bhi teacher yahaan ke teacher kii tarah apane halaat ke bare main nahin bataate hai
 a few years ago, a temporary teacher told the world that she was homeless, living on the street, and started demonstrating in front of New York's Department of Education when she made headlines
 logon kaa dhyaan is ore gaya
 Between 1990 and 2009, the number of contractual professors has increased
 america main shiksha par bajet lagaataar kaam hota ja rahaa he
 In colleges, contract teachers are employed instead of permanent
 theke ke shikshakon ko bhi ab kaam kam diya jaataa he taaki bajet batch sake
 Contract teachers are very cheap
 unhen research ke fund or anya suvidhaayen bhi nahin deni hoti he
 Their study time is cleverly reduced so that they do not qualify for health insurance
 gardian kii report main ek teacher ne bataaya ki maa kii maut ke baad agali subah aath baje class main thi
 Temporary teachers do not get holidays
 class se baahar ai to parking main gir gayi
 The statement of James Penney, a temporary professor of English, and her husband is published
 ye donon car main rahete hai
 Two dogs also live with him in the same car
 dashaboard par kuch nahin rakhte hai or na hi floor par taaki kisi ko pataa na chale ki beghar hai
 Clothes are worn with care so that poverty is not seen from outside
 kuch teacher to bahut hi chote se kamare main rahet hai
 In the treatment of the disease, more are buried under debt
 5 sitambar, 2016 ke indian express main apana naam gupt rakhte hue ek edock lekturer ne raashtrapati ko likhaa he ki aap hamaara naam nahin jaan paaenge lekin hamaare jaise lakho asthaayee shikshak uniwarsity main padhaa rahe hai or desh kii seva kar rahe hai
 We have a majority in any university
 ham 20-20 saal se asthaayee taur par padhaa rahe hai
 Without mentioning the name, Janab has written that at the age of 25, he decided to quit his corporate job and teach
 magar bees saal se yahi dekh rahaa hum ki ham sirf april se june ke bich hi uniwarsity ke sadsy hote hai
 Every year, they submit photocopies of the same certificate again and again
 agle satr yaa agle saal pataa nahin hota ki ham kya karenge
 Medical leave is not available, insurance is not available
 niyukti patr na hone ke kaaran kiraaye kaa makaan bhi koi nahin detaa he
 We also are unable to pay the rent properly
 kya aapako kabhi laga tha ki bharat or america ke profasaron ke halaat ekasmaan honge
 The universities and colleges of the country have neither data nor governments give such data to you
 sochie lakhon asthaayee shikshak 20-20 saal se padhaa rahe hai
 They are doing a great job in the country on half the salary
 berojgaare bharat ke yuvaaon par jabaran thopi ja rahi he
 These teachers cannot show their name and face
 agar ham inke gharon main jhankar dekhen to kya ham samaj sakate hai ki 10-10 saal se nunatam yaa aadhi selary par padhaane vaale in shikshakon kii aarthik sthiti kaise hoti he
 Most live in the general vicinity of Adhoc Teacher University
 santnagar, buraadi, wazirabad, vijay nagar main rahete hai
 Very few have a two-room house
 zyaadaatar peing guest banakar rahete hai jiskaa kiraaya paanch se saat hazaar rupee prati maah hota hoga
 How much is Permanent in Delhi University alone, how many are adhoc and how many are guests, its official number was not found on the university website which should have been
 magar edock shikshakon ke liye ladane vaale bataate hai ki kul das hazaar lekturer honge jisamen se kareeb paanch hazaar edock or 15 sau ke kareeb guest teacher honge
 Adhoc gets around 60,000 salary but that too for four months
 guest ko har lacture ke ek hazaar miltaa he, use maheene main pachchis hazaar se adhik nahin mil saktaa he
 In a city like Delhi, you stand as a teacher in class but earning Rs 25,000 slips you in a one room set of slums
 edock ko chaar maheene main sirf chaar chhuttiyaan milti hai
 There are many stories that he had to leave his job at the time of maternity leave
 nack kii cameti aati he to kalege kii manyata ke liye raat-raat bhar edock hi kaam karte hai
 The equation changes as the principal and department head in the college change and they hit the road
 aaj-kal edock vaale kisi tarah aresas ke logon kaa pataa khoj rahe hai, pehle ve sipiem ke logon kaa pataa khojate the ki kisi tarah permanent ho jaaen
 But not all teachers are dependent on this
 unki pratibha par koi ungali nahin uthaa saktaa magar raajnneeti ne koi permanent bhi nahin hone diya he
 The department head's ego also decides whether you will be permanent or not
 aaiye, aapako is andhere raste se aapako dilli vishvavidhyalay main padhaa rahe ek asthai teacher ke ghar le chal rahaa hum
 There is only one door for man and winds to enter
 khidki nahin he
 This teacher is as much visible as the world
 deevaaron ke saath kitaaben khadi hai
 Seeing so many books, it seems that this teacher will not be teaching or studying
 kursiyon kii haalat aisi he jaise bharat kii garibi rekha isi par aaraam farmaati ho
 This is the room of a teacher who taught adhoc for one year
 is kamare kaa kiraaya saadhe teen hazaar he
 You get 60,000 salary but will not get it next month
 chaar maheene ke baad kitne maheene tak nahin milegi pataa nahin
 That is why spending money carefully
 paanch kamaron par yahi ek shauchalay he
 It is okay to go in such places only in the dark
 is kamare se nikal jab yah master class main pahunchataa hoga to pachaason chaatro kii ummid ban jaataa hoga
 We do not understand the issue of adhoc teachers due to clever excuses such as lack of university cleanliness, process and budget
 dilli vishvavidlaay main har saal lakhon chaatr sapana lekar yahaan aate hai ki 98 fisadi par admician dene vaale diu ke shikshak uske sapanom ko saakaar kar denge
 This one room set in north-east Delhi has a professor who has been teaching adhoc for eight years
 cameraa thodaa bada he or saaf-suthra bhi he lekin is basti main isliye rahete hai kyonki yahaan saadhe saat hazaar rupee main van room set mil jaataa he jo agle maheene se 8,000 kaa hone vaala he
 When these professors, who study for 3–3 hours for each lecture, reach among 50 students, they feel that it is not just the teacher who has come, they also have a role model which is to build the nation

 The government does not appoint a permanent teacher at the place where they teach
 aapane self finance kalege suna hoga, skool suna hoga, kya self finance teacher suna tha
 More than 200 teachers are teaching under this category
 inhen self finance course ke liye rakhaa jaataa he

 It was once the number one institution of Punjab, from where people used to become teachers after studying
 ab shikshakon ko training dene vaale is college main das vishay aise hai jiske liye ek bhi permanent teacher nahin he
 Work is going on with the guest teacher
 ye haalat aaj se nahin he, magar ye haalat kal bhi thi, aaj bhi he or kal bhi rahegi
 The way teachers are hired in India, the situation is the same in America
 bharat main theke par rakhe jane vaale asthaayee shikshakon ko alag-alag naam se bulaate he
 These lecturers are kept in Colleges under the names Adhawk, Guest, Contractual, Temporary
 america main inhen Adjunct, Indenture kehete hai
 Everyone who teaches in college in India is called a professor
 america kii uniwarsity ke prophessoron kii badahaali par 2013 tak report ai thi
 On September 30, another horrific report appeared in the Guardian
 prophessoron kii garibi kii report
 The poverty of a woman lecturer who taught temporarily took her into the world of sex worker
 course padhaane kaa lod kam hua to paise or kam ho gaye
 Even after many attempts, when she did not get the money to spend, she broke down
 vah class main sabake saamne naam or chehre ke saath padhaati hai magar duniya ko apni yah takalif bataane ke liye naam or chehre ko chhipaana padataa he
 In order to teach a new generation, their commitment to developing understanding is so deep that they are unable to separate themselves from the work of teaching
 vaise har kisi ko doosraa kuch or kaam itani aasaani se miltaa bhi nahin
 It may be that the case of a lecturer in the world of sex workers is an exception, but everything is not an exception
 yah sahi he ki vahaan asthaayee yaa theke par padhaane vaale professor agar ek kamai ke dam par sammanjanak jivan nahin ji pate hai
 Now for many years, reports are being written and surveys are being done on the poverty of professors
 ek report ke anusaar, america ke collejon main 60 se 70 fisadi professor ab theke par rakhe jate hai
 According to the course, you get salary which is very less
 haalat ye he ki bahut se professor beghar hai, kiraaye ke chote se makaan main rahete hai
 Some live on the sidewalk and some have made the car their home
 bhojan or ilaaj ke liye sarkari sabsidi kii yojana par nirbhar rahete hai
 Go to church and eat and then teach in class
 hafte main 60-60 ghante padhaate hai, phir bhi kamai puri nahin hoti he
 Out of class, they run ola-uber taxis
 vahaan ke shikshakon ke paas khaane kii aarthik shakti nahin hoti, to ve maance ke khurchan, chikan kii haddiyaan or santare ke chhilake se khaanaa taiyaar karne kii racippi rakhte hai
 The recipe for cooking in the world of temporary teachers is also different
 vahaan ke bhi teacher yahaan ke teacher kii tarah apane halaat ke bare main nahin bataate hai
 a few years ago, a temporary teacher told the world that she was homeless, living on the street, and started demonstrating in front of New York's Department of Education when she made headlines
 logon kaa dhyaan is ore gaya
 Between 1990 and 2009, the number of contractual professors has increased
 america main shiksha par bajet lagaataar kaam hota ja rahaa he
 In colleges, contract teachers are employed instead of permanent
 theke ke shikshakon ko bhi ab kaam kam diya jaataa he taaki bajet batch sake
 Contract teachers are very cheap
 unhen research ke fund or anya suvidhaayen bhi nahin deni hoti he
 Their study time is cleverly reduced so that they do not qualify for health insurance
 gardian kii report main ek teacher ne bataaya ki maa kii maut ke baad agali subah aath baje class main thi
 Temporary teachers do not get holidays
 class se baahar ai to parking main gir gayi
 The statement of James Penney, a temporary professor of English, and her husband is published
 ye donon car main rahete hai
 Two dogs also live with him in the same car
 dashaboard par kuch nahin rakhte hai or na hi floor par taaki kisi ko pataa na chale ki beghar hai
 Clothes are worn with care so that poverty is not seen from outside
 kuch teacher to bahut hi chote se kamare main rahet hai
 In the treatment of the disease, more are buried under debt
 5 sitambar, 2016 ke indian express main apana naam gupt rakhte hue ek edock lekturer ne raashtrapati ko likhaa he ki aap hamaara naam nahin jaan paaenge lekin hamaare jaise lakho asthaayee shikshak uniwarsity main padhaa rahe hai or desh kii seva kar rahe hai
 We have a majority in any university
 ham 20-20 saal se asthaayee taur par padhaa rahe hai
 Without mentioning the name, Janab has written that at the age of 25, he decided to quit his corporate job and teach
 magar bees saal se yahi dekh rahaa hum ki ham sirf april se june ke bich hi uniwarsity ke sadsy hote hai
 Every year, they submit photocopies of the same certificate again and again
 agle satr yaa agle saal pataa nahin hota ki ham kya karenge
 Medical leave is not available, insurance is not available
 niyukti patr na hone ke kaaran kiraaye kaa makaan bhi koi nahin detaa he
 We also are unable to pay the rent properly
 kya aapako kabhi laga tha ki bharat or america ke profasaron ke halaat ekasmaan honge
 The universities and colleges of the country have neither data nor governments give such data to you
 sochie lakhon asthaayee shikshak 20-20 saal se padhaa rahe hai
 They are doing a great job in the country on half the salary
 berojgaare bharat ke yuvaaon par jabaran thopi ja rahi he
 These teachers cannot show their name and face
 agar ham inke gharon main jhankar dekhen to kya ham samaj sakate hai ki 10-10 saal se nunatam yaa aadhi selary par padhaane vaale in shikshakon kii aarthik sthiti kaise hoti he
 Most live in the general vicinity of Adhoc Teacher University
 santnagar, buraadi, wazirabad, vijay nagar main rahete hai
 Very few have a two-room house
 zyaadaatar peing guest banakar rahete hai jiskaa kiraaya paanch se saat hazaar rupee prati maah hota hoga
 How much is Permanent in Delhi University alone, how many are adhoc and how many are guests, its official number was not found on the university website which should have been
 magar edock shikshakon ke liye ladane vaale bataate hai ki kul das hazaar lekturer honge jisamen se kareeb paanch hazaar edock or 15 sau ke kareeb guest teacher honge
 Adhoc gets around 60,000 salary but that too for four months
 guest ko har lacture ke ek hazaar miltaa he, use maheene main pachchis hazaar se adhik nahin mil saktaa he
 In a city like Delhi, you stand as a teacher in class but earning Rs 25,000 slips you in a one room set of slums
 edock ko chaar maheene main sirf chaar chhuttiyaan milti hai
 There are many stories that he had to leave his job at the time of maternity leave
 nack kii cameti aati he to kalege kii manyata ke liye raat-raat bhar edock hi kaam karte hai
 The equation changes as the principal and department head in the college change and they hit the road
 aaj-kal edock vaale kisi tarah aresas ke logon kaa pataa khoj rahe hai, pehle ve sipiem ke logon kaa pataa khojate the ki kisi tarah permanent ho jaaen
 But not all teachers are dependent on this
 unki pratibha par koi ungali nahin uthaa saktaa magar raajnneeti ne koi permanent bhi nahin hone diya he
 The department head's ego also decides whether you will be permanent or not
 aaiye, aapako is andhere raste se aapako dilli vishvavidhyalay main padhaa rahe ek asthai teacher ke ghar le chal rahaa hum
 There is only one door for man and winds to enter
 khidki nahin he
 This teacher is as much visible as the world
 deevaaron ke saath kitaaben khadi hai
 Seeing so many books, it seems that this teacher will not be teaching or studying
 kursiyon kii haalat aisi he jaise bharat kii garibi rekha isi par aaraam farmaati ho
 This is the room of a teacher who taught adhoc for one year
 is kamare kaa kiraaya saadhe teen hazaar he
 You get 60,000 salary but will not get it next month
 chaar maheene ke baad kitne maheene tak nahin milegi pataa nahin
 That is why spending money carefully
 paanch kamaron par yahi ek shauchalay he
 It is okay to go in such places only in the dark
 is kamare se nikal jab yah master class main pahunchataa hoga to pachaason chaatro kii ummid ban jaataa hoga
 We do not understand the issue of adhoc teachers due to clever excuses such as lack of university cleanliness, process and budget
 dilli vishvavidlaay main har saal lakhon chaatr sapana lekar yahaan aate hai ki 98 fisadi par admician dene vaale diu ke shikshak uske sapanom ko saakaar kar denge
 This one room set in north-east Delhi has a professor who has been teaching adhoc for eight years
 cameraa thodaa bada he or saaf-suthra bhi he lekin is basti main isliye rahete hai kyonki yahaan saadhe saat hazaar rupee main van room set mil jaataa he jo agle maheene se 8,000 kaa hone vaala he
 When these professors, who study for 3–3 hours for each lecture, reach among 50 students, they feel that it is not just the teacher who has come, they also have a role model which is to build the nation

 She teaches in class with a name and face in front of everyone, but to tell the world her trouble, the name and face have to be hidden
 nai peedi ko padhaane ke liye, unke andar samaj viksit karne ke liye unka kamitment itnaa gaharaa he ki ve padhaane ke kaam se khud ko alag nahin kar paati hai
 By the way, not everyone gets some other work so easily
 ho saktaa he sex varkar kii duniya main kisi lekturer ke jane kaa kissa apwaad bhar ho, magar sab kuch apwaad nahin he
 It is true that there are temporary or contractual professors who do not live a respectable life on the basis of earning
 ab to kai saal se prophessoron kii garibi par report likhi ja rahi hai or survey kiye ja rahe hai
 According to a report, 60 to 70 percent of professors in US colleges are now hired
 course padhaane ke hisaab se selary milti he jo bahut kam hoti he
 The condition is that many professors are homeless, living in small tenements
 kuch footpath par rahete hai or kuch ne car ko hi apana ghar bana liya he
 The government subsidies for food and treatment depend on the scheme
 carch main jaakar khaanaa khate hai or phir class main padhaate hai
 Teaches 60-60 hours a week, yet earning is not complete
 class se nikalakar ola-ubar kii texiyaan chalaate hai
 The teachers there do not have the financial power to eat, so they keep a recipe for preparing food with meat scraps, chicken bones and orange peel
 asthaayee shikshakon kii garibi kii duniya main khaanaa banane kii racippi bhi alag he
 The teachers there also do not tell about their situation like the teacher here
 kuch saal pehle jab vahaan kii ek asthaayee teacher ne duniya ko bataaya ki ve beghar hai, sadak par rahi hai or neuyark ke shiksha vibhaag ke saamne pradarshan karne lageen tab jaakar hedline bani
 The attention of the people went to this
 1990 se 2009 ke bich theke par rakhe jane vaale prophessoron kii sankhya badi he
 In the US, the budget on education is becoming increasingly frequent
 collejon main permanent kii jagah theke ke shikshakon se kaam chalaaya jaataa he
 Contract teachers are also given less work so that the budget can be saved
 theke ke shikshak kaaphi saste hote hai
 They also do not have to provide research funds and other facilities
 chaalaaki se unki padhai kaa samay kam kar diya jaataa he taaki ve swasthya beemaa ke yogya na ho saken
 In the Guardian report, a teacher said that after the mother's death, she was in class at eight o'clock the next morning
 asthaayee shikshakon ko chhuttiyaan nahin milti hai
 When she came out of class, she fell in the parking lot
 ek angrezi ke asthaayee professor james penni or unke pati kaa bayaan chapa he
 Both of them live in the car
 usee car main inke saath do kute bhi rahete hai
 Nothing is placed on the dashboard nor on the floor so that no one knows that they are homeless
 kapade sambhaal kar pahante hai taaki garibi baahar se na dikh jaae
 Some teachers have stayed in a very small room
 beemaari ke ilaaj main or bhi karze se dab jate hai
 Keeping his name a secret in the Indian Express of September 5, 2016, an adhoc lecturer wrote to the President that you will not know our name but millions of temporary teachers like us are teaching in the university and serving the country
 kisi bhi uniwarsity main hamaara hi bahumat he
 We have been teaching temporarily for 20-20 years
 naam na bataate hue janaab ne likhaa he ki 25 saal kii umr main korporate kii naukari chhod padhaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 But for twenty years i am seeing that we are members of the university only between April and June
 har saal vahi certificate kii photocopy baar-baar jamaa karte hai
 We don't know what we will do next season or next year
 medical live nahin miltaa, beemaa nahin miltaa he
 Due to lack of appointment letters, no one offers a house for rent
 ham kiraaya bhi thik se nahin chukaa pate hai
 Have you ever felt that the conditions of the professors of India and America will be the same
 desh ke vishvavidhyalayon or collejon kaa na to data he or na hi sarkarein is tarah ke data aapako detii hai
 Think millions of temporary teachers have been teaching for 20-20 years
 aadhi selary par wo desh kaa kitna bada kaam kar rahe hai
 Unemployment is being forced on the youth of India
 ye shikshak apana naam or cheharaa nahin dikhaa sakate hai
 If we look into their homes, can we understand how the financial condition of these teachers who have been teaching at minimum or half salary for 10-10 years? zyaadaatar edock teacher uniwarsity ke aas-paas ke saamaanya ilaake main rahete hai
 Lives in Santnagar, Burari, Wazirabad, Vijay Nagar
 bahut kam ke paas do kamaron kaa ghar hota he
 Most stay as a paying guest, whose rent will be five to seven thousand rupees per month
 akele dilli vishvavidhyalay main permanent kitne hai, edock kitne hai or guest kitne hai, isaki aadhikarik sankhya uniwarsity kii website par nahin mili jo ki honi chahie thi
 But the fighters for adhoc teachers say that there will be a total of ten thousand lecturers, out of which about five thousand adhoc and 1500 will be guest teachers
 edock ko 60,000 ke kareeb selary milti he magar wo bhi chaar maheene ke liye
 The guest gets one thousand for every lecture, he cannot get more than twenty five thousand a month
 dilli jaise shahar main aap class main teacher banakar khadey hote hai magar 25,000 kii kamai aapako jhuggiyon ke van room set main patake detii he
 Adhoc gets just four holidays in four months
 aise bahut se kisse hai ki meternity live ke samay naukari chhodani pad gai
 When the committee of NAC comes, adhoc work overnight for the recognition of the college
 college main principal or vibhaag ke adhyaksh ke badalte hi sameekaran badalata he or ve road par aa jate hai
 Nowadays, people with adhoc are searching for the address of RSS people in some way, earlier they used to search for the address of CPM people to somehow become permanent
 magar saare shikshak isi ke bharose yahaan nahin hai
 No one can raise his finger on his talent, but politics has not allowed any permanent
 department head kaa igo bhi tay karata he ki aapkaa permanent hoga yaa nahin
 Come, i am taking you through this dark path to the house of a temporary teacher studying in Delhi University
 aadmi or hawaaon ke andar aane ke liye ek daravaaza hi he bas
 There is no window
 jitna dikh rahaa he utana hi sansar he is teacher kaa
 Books stand along the walls
 itani kitaaben dekhakar lagata he ki yah teacher padhaata nahin hoga yaa padhakar class main nahin jaataa hoga
 The condition of the chairs is such that the poverty line of India rests on it
 ek saal se edock padhaane vaale teacher kaa yah cameraa he
 The rent of this room is three and a half thousand
 selary 60,000 milti he magar agle maheene milegi yaa nahin pataa nahin
 How many months will not be found after four months
 isliye paisa sanbhal kar karch karte hai

 This room has every good book of Hindi literature, a repository of knowledge, one who lives has written two books but the job is not confirmed
 pataa bhi nahin hota ki agle semester par kis kalege main rahenge, chaatro se jo sambandh banataa he wo tut jaataa he, shikshak kii chintaa mat kiijie, chaatro kii hi sochie, wo jis shikshak par bharosa karte hai wo agle semester main gaayab ho jaataa he
 One room moves into the world of sets
 ek kamare kii class, ek kamare kaa jivan
 Not married and can't dilli vishvavidhyalay main jitne pad khaali hai unhen bharna shuru ho to bhi saare pad bharne main do saal se zyaada kaa vakt lag jayega wo bhi tab jab rose yah kaam ho
 Teacher says he has passion for teaching
 dilli vishvavidlaay main yah ho nahin saktaa ki class main teacher na ho
 Adhawk has to be and Permanente also takes classes
 chhuttiyon ko lekar dardanaak kahaniyaan hai
 The health of the parents is bad, a friend has to go by giving a class
 apni or doston kii shaadi main nahin ja pate hai
 Since the media space is so full of hindu-muslim subject and political propaganda that the condition of the college and state university in your district is not exposed and people also have less meaning
 hamaare sahyogi anuraag dwari ne madhya pradesh ke chambal ilaake ke kalejon main padhaane vaale kuch shikshakon se baat kii
 He went to college with a teacher
 muraina kaa piji exlence kalege he, yahaan 1100 chaatr padhate hai
 Is Professor of Zoology
 2002 main piechdi puri karne ke baad se isi kalege main padhaa rahe hai
 It has been 15 years but not confirmed
 permanent nahin hue
 Teachers like these are called guest scholars
 naam to bada sanskari lagata he magar inkaa vetan sunenge to tivi band kar denge
 a college professor gets 7-8 thousand rupees a month while teaching more than 150 students in three years
 aap sochie itani kam kamai main ye chaah kar apane vishay kii ek kitaab tak nahin kareed sakate
 What will your children teach? gavarment piji kalege main 38 pad srujit hai
 23 are permanent and 15 are temporary
 madhya pradesh kii jabalpur hoicourt ke dabl bench ne 14 sitambar, 2017 ko ek aadesh diya he
 Till now the government was doing this that the temporary teacher was removed from there after some time
 uski jagah doosraa asthaayee shikshak rakh le rahi thi
 The court said that whoever comes in their place will be permanent
 asthaayee kii jagah asthaayee nahin aayega
 Call it temporary, contractual guest guest, but everyone knows that the name of exploitation of teachers is being changed in the name of honor
 rajya ke ucch shiksha vibhaag kii website par kuch aankade is tarah hai- madhya pradesh ke sarkari kalejon main 7677 shikshakon ke pad hai
 Only 2638 teachers are permanent
 paanch hazaar se zyaada shikshak atithi vidwaan banakar padhaa rahe hai
 When the vacancy is vacant, then why not fill the permanent
 atithi vidwaanon kaa rate bhi website par diya gaya he
 It turned out that there are many types of guest scholars as well
 unke alag-alag naam hai- Guest Scholar Professor - Rs 825 per workday atithi vidwaan kridadhari- 580 rupee kaarydiwas Guest Scholar Granthal - Rs 580 per workday atithi vidwaan / shikshak, sanskrit mahavidhyalay- 390 rupee prati kaarydiwas Guest Scholar Teacher Graduation, Sanskrit - Rs 290 per workday atithi vidwaan sahaayak vyaakhyaata, sanskrit- 275 rupee prati kaarydiwas You see what is the condition of higher education
 naam ucch shiksha kaa he or mehtaanaa nimna str kaa
 Governments do so much drama in the name of Sanskrit, Sanskrit guest scholars have the lowest rate of remuneration
 275 rupee
 Just one rupee more than the minimum wage
 apane guruon ko naukari die bagair bharat mek in india kii kis factory main vishwa guru ban rahaa he
 Smita Sukhwal is a visiting scholar at Nehru College, a college in Agar Malwa, Madhya Pradesh
 1966 main is college kii sthapana hui thi
 The number of sanctioned posts in this college is 32 but only 5 are permanent
 yahaan par 27 shikshak atithi vidwaan hai
 That is, the entire college is running on the strength of guest scholars
 ek ne kaha ki jab naukari nahin de sakate hai to ujisi har saal net kii pariksha kyon leti he
 The situation is also bad in Punjab
 yahaan ke skool-collejon main bhi badi sankhya main pad khaali hai

 jaipal singh ne bataaya ki punjab main 2007 ke baad se niyamit teacher kii bhartee nahin hui he, us samay sirf angrezi main hui thi
 The rest of the subject was last admitted in 1996
 punjab main guest faikalti kaa bhi bura haal he
 Their salary cannot exceed 21,600
 lekin aadhi se kam selary sarkaar detii he, aadhi se zyaada chaatr admician ke samay dete hai
 Three years ago a circular came that the government would give only Rs 10,000
 baaki paisa pareint-teacher association kii taraf se diya jayega
 11,600 rupees is deposited by the PTA at the time of admission
 tippaniyan There is another new category in Punjab
 is teesri catagori ko self finance teacher
 The government does not appoint a permanent teacher at the place where they teach
 aapane self finance kalege suna hoga, skool suna hoga, kya self finance teacher suna tha
 More than 200 teachers are teaching under this category
 inhen self finance course ke liye rakhaa jaataa he
 BBA, MCA, Hospitality Management types come in it
 bachche hi inaki selary admician ke samay dete hai
 The government does not pay a single penny for them
 patiala kaa ek mashhoor bied training skool he
 It was established in 1955, with Home Minister GB Pant going for its inauguration
 200 acre zamin main yah santhaan bana he
 It was once the number one institution of Punjab, from where people used to become teachers after studying
 ab shikshakon ko training dene vaale is college main das vishay aise hai jiske liye ek bhi permanent teacher nahin he
 Work is going on with the guest teacher
 vahaan ke shikshakon ke paas khaane kii aarthik shakti nahin hoti, to ve maance ke khurchan, chikan kii haddiyaan or santare ke chhilake se khaanaa taiyaar karne kii racippi rakhte hai
 The recipe for cooking in the world of temporary teachers is also different
 vahaan ke bhi teacher yahaan ke teacher kii tarah apane halaat ke bare main nahin bataate hai
 a few years ago, a temporary teacher told the world that she was homeless, living on the street, and started demonstrating in front of New York's Department of Education when she made headlines
 logon kaa dhyaan is ore gaya
 Between 1990 and 2009, the number of contractual professors has increased
 america main shiksha par bajet lagaataar kaam hota ja rahaa he
 In colleges, contract teachers are employed instead of permanent
 theke ke shikshakon ko bhi ab kaam kam diya jaataa he taaki bajet batch sake
 Contract teachers are very cheap
 unhen research ke fund or anya suvidhaayen bhi nahin deni hoti he
 Their study time is cleverly reduced so that they do not qualify for health insurance
 gardian kii report main ek teacher ne bataaya ki maa kii maut ke baad agali subah aath baje class main thi
 Temporary teachers do not get holidays
 class se baahar ai to parking main gir gayi
 The statement of James Penney, a temporary professor of English, and her husband is published
 ye donon car main rahete hai
 Two dogs also live with him in the same car
 dashaboard par kuch nahin rakhte hai or na hi floor par taaki kisi ko pataa na chale ki beghar hai
 Clothes are worn with care so that poverty is not seen from outside
 kuch teacher to bahut hi chote se kamare main rahet hai
 In the treatment of the disease, more are buried under debt
 5 sitambar, 2016 ke indian express main apana naam gupt rakhte hue ek edock lekturer ne raashtrapati ko likhaa he ki aap hamaara naam nahin jaan paaenge lekin hamaare jaise lakho asthaayee shikshak uniwarsity main padhaa rahe hai or desh kii seva kar rahe hai
 We have a majority in any university
 ham 20-20 saal se asthaayee taur par padhaa rahe hai
 Without mentioning the name, Janab has written that at the age of 25, he decided to quit his corporate job and teach
 magar bees saal se yahi dekh rahaa hum ki ham sirf april se june ke bich hi uniwarsity ke sadsy hote hai
 Every year, they submit photocopies of the same certificate again and again
 agle satr yaa agle saal pataa nahin hota ki ham kya karenge
 Medical leave is not available, insurance is not available
 niyukti patr na hone ke kaaran kiraaye kaa makaan bhi koi nahin detaa he
 We also are unable to pay the rent properly
 kya aapako kabhi laga tha ki bharat or america ke profasaron ke halaat ekasmaan honge
 The universities and colleges of the country have neither data nor governments give such data to you
 sochie lakhon asthaayee shikshak 20-20 saal se padhaa rahe hai
 They are doing a great job in the country on half the salary
 berojgaare bharat ke yuvaaon par jabaran thopi ja rahi he
 These teachers cannot show their name and face
 agar ham inke gharon main jhankar dekhen to kya ham samaj sakate hai ki 10-10 saal se nunatam yaa aadhi selary par padhaane vaale in shikshakon kii aarthik sthiti kaise hoti he
 Most live in the general vicinity of Adhoc Teacher University
 santnagar, buraadi, wazirabad, vijay nagar main rahete hai
 Very few have a two-room house
 zyaadaatar peing guest banakar rahete hai jiskaa kiraaya paanch se saat hazaar rupee prati maah hota hoga
 How much is Permanent in Delhi University alone, how many are adhoc and how many are guests, its official number was not found on the university website which should have been
 magar edock shikshakon ke liye ladane vaale bataate hai ki kul das hazaar lekturer honge jisamen se kareeb paanch hazaar edock or 15 sau ke kareeb guest teacher honge
 Adhoc gets around 60,000 salary but that too for four months
 guest ko har lacture ke ek hazaar miltaa he, use maheene main pachchis hazaar se adhik nahin mil saktaa he
 In a city like Delhi, you stand as a teacher in class but earning Rs 25,000 slips you in a one room set of slums
 edock ko chaar maheene main sirf chaar chhuttiyaan milti hai
 There are many stories that he had to leave his job at the time of maternity leave
 nack kii cameti aati he to kalege kii manyata ke liye raat-raat bhar edock hi kaam karte hai
 The equation changes as the principal and department head in the college change and they hit the road
 aaj-kal edock vaale kisi tarah aresas ke logon kaa pataa khoj rahe hai, pehle ve sipiem ke logon kaa pataa khojate the ki kisi tarah permanent ho jaaen
 But not all teachers are dependent on this
 unki pratibha par koi ungali nahin uthaa saktaa magar raajnneeti ne koi permanent bhi nahin hone diya he
 The department head's ego also decides whether you will be permanent or not
 aaiye, aapako is andhere raste se aapako dilli vishvavidhyalay main padhaa rahe ek asthai teacher ke ghar le chal rahaa hum
 There is only one door for man and winds to enter
 khidki nahin he
 This teacher is as much visible as the world
 deevaaron ke saath kitaaben khadi hai
 Seeing so many books, it seems that this teacher will not be teaching or studying
 kursiyon kii haalat aisi he jaise bharat kii garibi rekha isi par aaraam farmaati ho
 This is the room of a teacher who taught adhoc for one year
 is kamare kaa kiraaya saadhe teen hazaar he
 You get 60,000 salary but will not get it next month
 chaar maheene ke baad kitne maheene tak nahin milegi pataa nahin
 That is why spending money carefully
 paanch kamaron par yahi ek shauchalay he
 It is okay to go in such places only in the dark
 is kamare se nikal jab yah master class main pahunchataa hoga to pachaason chaatro kii ummid ban jaataa hoga
 We do not understand the issue of adhoc teachers due to clever excuses such as lack of university cleanliness, process and budget
 dilli vishvavidlaay main har saal lakhon chaatr sapana lekar yahaan aate hai ki 98 fisadi par admician dene vaale diu ke shikshak uske sapanom ko saakaar kar denge
 This one room set in north-east Delhi has a professor who has been teaching adhoc for eight years
 cameraa thodaa bada he or saaf-suthra bhi he lekin is basti main isliye rahete hai kyonki yahaan saadhe saat hazaar rupee main van room set mil jaataa he jo agle maheene se 8,000 kaa hone vaala he
 When these professors, who study for 3–3 hours for each lecture, reach among 50 students, they feel that it is not just the teacher who has come, they also have a role model which is to build the nation
 har netaa bol kar chalaa jaataa he ki shikshak raashtra nirmaataa hai, yah nahin bolegaa ki raashtra nirmaataa phir aisi haalat main kyon hai
 The person living in this room told that one always has to look refreshed by bathing with smelly water
 60,000 kii kamai kab khatm ho jaaegi pataa nahin, bahanon kii shaadi kii zimmedaari he, apni shaadi bhi nahin kii
 Have been teaching adhoc in the same college for eight years
 iskaa matlab he us kalege main jagah he to phir permanent kyon nahin hota he
 This room has every good book of Hindi literature, a repository of knowledge, one who lives has written two books but the job is not confirmed
 pataa bhi nahin hota ki agle semester par kis kalege main rahenge, chaatro se jo sambandh banataa he wo tut jaataa he, shikshak kii chintaa mat kiijie, chaatro kii hi sochie, wo jis shikshak par bharosa karte hai wo agle semester main gaayab ho jaataa he
 One room moves into the world of sets
 ek kamare kii class, ek kamare kaa jivan
 Not married and can't dilli vishvavidhyalay main jitne pad khaali hai unhen bharna shuru ho to bhi saare pad bharne main do saal se zyaada kaa vakt lag jayega wo bhi tab jab rose yah kaam ho

 They also do not have to provide research funds and other facilities
 chaalaaki se unki padhai kaa samay kam kar diya jaataa he taaki ve swasthya beemaa ke yogya na ho saken
 In the Guardian report, a teacher said that after the mother's death, she was in class at eight o'clock the next morning
 asthaayee shikshakon ko chhuttiyaan nahin milti hai
 When she came out of class, she fell in the parking lot
 ek angrezi ke asthaayee professor james penni or unke pati kaa bayaan chapa he

 usee car main inke saath do kute bhi rahete hai
 Nothing is placed on the dashboard nor on the floor so that no one knows that they are homeless
 kapade sambhaal kar pahante hai taaki garibi baahar se na dikh jaae
 Some teachers have stayed in a very small room
 beemaari ke ilaaj main or bhi karze se dab jate hai
 Keeping his name a secret in the Indian Express of September 5, 2016, an adhoc lecturer wrote to the President that you will not know our name but millions of temporary teachers like us are teaching in the university and serving the country
 kisi bhi uniwarsity main hamaara hi bahumat he
 We have been teaching temporarily for 20-20 years
 naam na bataate hue janaab ne likhaa he ki 25 saal kii umr main korporate kii naukari chhod padhaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 But for twenty years i am seeing that we are members of the university only between April and June
 har saal vahi certificate kii photocopy baar-baar jamaa karte hai
 We don't know what we will do next season or next year
 medical live nahin miltaa, beemaa nahin miltaa he
 Due to lack of appointment letters, no one offers a house for rent
 ham kiraaya bhi thik se nahin chukaa pate hai
 Have you ever felt that the conditions of the professors of India and America will be the same
 desh ke vishvavidhyalayon or collejon kaa na to data he or na hi sarkarein is tarah ke data aapako detii hai
 Think millions of temporary teachers have been teaching for 20-20 years
 aadhi selary par wo desh kaa kitna bada kaam kar rahe hai
 Unemployment is being forced on the youth of India
 ye shikshak apana naam or cheharaa nahin dikhaa sakate hai
 If we look into their homes, can we understand how the financial condition of these teachers who have been teaching at minimum or half salary for 10-10 years? zyaadaatar edock teacher uniwarsity ke aas-paas ke saamaanya ilaake main rahete hai
 Lives in Santnagar, Burari, Wazirabad, Vijay Nagar
 bahut kam ke paas do kamaron kaa ghar hota he
 Most stay as a paying guest, whose rent will be five to seven thousand rupees per month
 akele dilli vishvavidhyalay main permanent kitne hai, edock kitne hai or guest kitne hai, isaki aadhikarik sankhya uniwarsity kii website par nahin mili jo ki honi chahie thi
 But the fighters for adhoc teachers say that there will be a total of ten thousand lecturers, out of which about five thousand adhoc and 1500 will be guest teachers
 edock ko 60,000 ke kareeb selary milti he magar wo bhi chaar maheene ke liye
 The guest gets one thousand for every lecture, he cannot get more than twenty five thousand a month
 dilli jaise shahar main aap class main teacher banakar khadey hote hai magar 25,000 kii kamai aapako jhuggiyon ke van room set main patake detii he
 Adhoc gets just four holidays in four months
 aise bahut se kisse hai ki meternity live ke samay naukari chhodani pad gai
 When the committee of NAC comes, adhoc work overnight for the recognition of the college
 college main principal or vibhaag ke adhyaksh ke badalte hi sameekaran badalata he or ve road par aa jate hai
 Nowadays, people with adhoc are searching for the address of RSS people in some way, earlier they used to search for the address of CPM people to somehow become permanent
 magar saare shikshak isi ke bharose yahaan nahin hai
 No one can raise his finger on his talent, but politics has not allowed any permanent
 department head kaa igo bhi tay karata he ki aapkaa permanent hoga yaa nahin
 Come, i am taking you through this dark path to the house of a temporary teacher studying in Delhi University
 aadmi or hawaaon ke andar aane ke liye ek daravaaza hi he bas
 There is no window
 jitna dikh rahaa he utana hi sansar he is teacher kaa
 Books stand along the walls
 itani kitaaben dekhakar lagata he ki yah teacher padhaata nahin hoga yaa padhakar class main nahin jaataa hoga
 The condition of the chairs is such that the poverty line of India rests on it
 ek saal se edock padhaane vaale teacher kaa yah cameraa he
 The rent of this room is three and a half thousand
 selary 60,000 milti he magar agle maheene milegi yaa nahin pataa nahin
 How many months will not be found after four months
 isliye paisa sanbhal kar karch karte hai
 This is the only toilet on five rooms
 aisi jagahon par andhere main hi janaa thik hota he
 Out of this room, when it reaches the master class, then fifty students will be expected
 ham edock shikshakon ke masale ko uniwarsity kii safai, prakriya or bajet kii kami jaise chatur bahaanon ke kaaran nahin samaj pate hai
 Every year, millions of students come to Delhi University with the dream that DU teachers who give admission at 98% will make their dreams come true
 uttar-purvi dilli ke is van room set main aath saal se edock padhaa rahe ek professor rahete hai
 The room is a bit big and clean as well but stays in this colony because a one room set is available here for seven and a half thousand rupees which is going to be 8,000 from next month
 har lacture ke liye 3-3 ghante padhane vaale ye professor jab 50 chaatro ke bich pahunchate hai to unhen lagata he ki sirf teacher nahin aayaa he, unke bich ek adarsh bhi aayaa he jiskaa kaam raashtra kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 Every leader goes on saying that teachers are nation builders, it will not say why the nation builders are in such a situation again
 is kamare main rahane vaale ne bataaya ki badboodaar pani se nahaakar hameshaa tarotaza bhi dikhnaa he
 i do not know when the earning of 60,000 will end, the sisters have the responsibility of marriage, did not even marry themselves
 aath saal se ek hi kalege main edock padhaa rahe hai
 This means there is a place in that college, so why is it not permanent? is kamare main hindi sahitya kii har behtareen kitaab he, gyaan kaa bhandar he, jo rahata he usne do kitaaben bhi likh lee hai magar naukari pakki nahin hui he
 Don't even know which college to stay in next semester, the relationship that is formed with the students is broken, don't worry about the teacher, think of the students, the teacher they trust disappears in the next semester
 
 van room set kii duniya main chalaa jaataa he
 One room class, one room life
 shaadi kii nahin he or kar nahin sakate
 If the posts of Delhi University start filling those vacancies, then it will take more than two years to fill all the posts, even when it is daily
 teacher kehete hai unamem jazbaa he padhaane ko lekar
 In Delhi University it cannot be that there is no teacher in the class
 edock ko hona hi padataa he or permanent bhi class lete hai
 There are painful stories about the holidays
 mata-pita kii tabiyat kharaab he, kisi mitra ko class dekar janaa hota he
 They are unable to go to their and friends' wedding
 chunki hindu-muslim vishay or siyaasi propeganda se media kaa spes itnaa bharaa hua he ki aapke zile ke college or rajya kii uniwarsity kaa haal saamne nahin aa paata or logon ko bhi kam hi matlab hota he
 Our colleague Anurag Dwari spoke to some teachers who teach in colleges in Chambal area of madhya Pradesh
 ek shikshak ke saath unke college bhi gaye
 Morena has PG Excellence College, where 1100 students study here
 zoology ke professor hai
 Since completing his phd in 2002, he has been teaching in this college
 15 saal ho gaye magar pakki nahin hui he
 Permanent did not happen
 inke jaise shikshakon ko atithi vidwaan kaha jaataa he
 The name sounds big, but if you hear his salary, you will turn off the TV
 ek college ke professor ko 7-8 hazaar rupye maheenaa miltaa he jabaki teen saal main 150 se adhik chaatro ko padhaate hai
 Think you can not buy even a book on your subject by wishing for such a low income
 aapke bacchon ko kya padhaayenge
 38 posts have been created in Government PG College
 23 permanent hai or 15 asthaayee hai
 The Double Bench of Jabalpur High Court of Madhya Pradesh has ordered an order on 14 September 2017
 abhi tak sarkaar yah kar rahi thi ki asthaayee shikshak ko kuch samay baad vahaan se hataa de rahi thi
 She was replaced by another temporary teacher
 adaalat ne kaha ki inaki jagah doosraa jo aayega wo permanent hoga
 Temporary will not replace temporary
 asthaayee, kantrecual ko aap atithi vidwaan kah lijie magar sabko pataa he sammaan ke naam par shikshakon ke shoshan kaa naam badla ja rahaa he
 Some of the figures on the website of the state's Higher Education Department are as follows - Madhya Pradesh government colleges have 7677 teachers posts
 maatr 2638 shikshak hi sthai hai
 More than five thousand teachers are teaching as guest scholars
 jab pad khaali hai to permanent bharti kyon nahin
 Guest scholars are also rated on the website

 Jaipal Singh said that regular teachers have not been recruited in Punjab since 2007, at that time only in English

 When these professors, who study for 3–3 hours for each lecture, reach among 50 students, they feel that it is not just the teacher who has come, they also have a role model which is to build the nation
 har netaa bol kar chalaa jaataa he ki shikshak raashtra nirmaataa hai, yah nahin bolegaa ki raashtra nirmaataa phir aisi haalat main kyon hai
 The person living in this room told that one always has to look refreshed by bathing with smelly water

 Kapil Dev, the captain of the Indian team that won the Cricket World Cup for the first time in 1983, has said on Tuesday that Virat Kohli, the main head of batting in the current Indian team, will hold a record more than any other cricketer in the world of this game

 dilli main ceiling kii prakiya khan market main ek baar phir se shuru ho gai he
 Yesterday i
e
 on Monday, eight restaurants and salons were sealed and all the restaurants and stores were inspected by NDMC from around 12 o'clock today
 aaj kareeb chaar imaaraton ke first floor par hue avaidh nirmaanon ko sil kar diya gaya to vahiin puure khan market ke first or second floor ko bhi dekha ja rahaa tha
 NDMC officials say that this process of sealing will last a full day today
 or avaidh nirmaan pye jane par or niyamon kii andekhi par jagah ko sil kar diya jayega
 The sealing process was initiated citing non-payment of conversion charges at around 3 am on sealed shops even after payment of conversion charges
 lekin association kaa yah aarope he ki kanvarshan chargeej or tamaam enosi (NOC) clear hone ke baad bhi, avaidh nirmaanon ko bematlab mudda banaaya gaya he
 The owners of any restaurants and stores had not been given any notice of dough beforehand
 achaanak ceiling shuri kar di gai or sabhi kagajaton ke sahi hone ke baavjood ceiling kii ja rahi he

 The weekend hangouts of the High Class Society of Delhi are also mostly here

 But when talking to the people who came here, they also believed that if the restaurants or stores running by ignoring the rules are being sealed then it is right
 par pehle se hi NDMC or restaraan maalikon ko niyam ko lekar clear hona chahie
 So that the safety of those who come here should not be put on the claim
 yahaan aksar apane doston ke saath lunch par aane vaali sima kaa kahana he ki ' ye sahi he par athurities ko ye pehle se dekhnaa chahie tha
 If there was a shortage here, how are these restaurants running for so many years, first they were given permission to run them in collusion and now they are taking action
 'khan market association head sanjeev mehara kaa maananaa he ki ' ye tarika sahi nahin he
 There was no such illegal happening here, for which this spectacle has been done, which is also sealed, it is a small thick terrace or corridor, which can be removed from the discussion by sitting together
 aisi kaarywai kii jarurat nahin thi
 'let me tell you that till now only illegal terraces and balcony areas are sealed
 or agar second floor par ek se zyada kamaron kaa nirmaan hua he to wo bhi sil kiyae gaye he
 The process of sealing will continue on many major areas in Delhi, after the Supreme Court order, NDMC has started this action

 Yes, he did say that "I wouldn't call these deaths 'mysterious' but they were 'unusual'"

 lui tilitapane duusare kaarykaal main modi sarkaar ne bharat kii sangheey vyavastha main kendrikaran ko gaharaa karne ke iraade ke sanket die hai
 The outline of this agenda started appearing in the first term itself
 iske mutabik, centre sarkaar kii nitiyon ke samanvay, vitt prabandhan or uske karyanvayan ke liye un daayaron main bhi majboot dakhal chahie, jo samvidhan main rajyon ke liye arakshit hai or unamem rajya agrani khilaadi rahe hai
 Simultaneously, it is an attempt to increase competition between states by strengthening the India idea as a single national market, in which businesses, consumers and workers are all dynamic
 ye 'sahakaari' or 'pratispardhi sanghavaad' ke kendriya vishay hai, jinhen 2014 main satta main aane ke baad se bhaajapa aage badha rahi he
 The Modi government in its second term is encouraging labor mobility with an effort to create a national market and reduce the barriers to inter-state trade (one country, one tax)
 udhaaharan ke liye, rashan card kii portability ke madhyam se ek raashtra, ek rashan card ko bhi ek rashtriya naagarikta ke sankalp ke saath badhaava diya gaya he
 Re-airing the issue of ending Kashmir's autonomy and making Hindi a national language has given the message that the multi-layered system of citizenship was created using the constructive and flexible virtue of federalism and which created national and regional Diversity has been adjusted, being used to demolish it
 ek raashtra, ek bazaar kaa aahvaan kai tarah kii nitiyon ko saath laata he, jaise krishi bazaar ko ekikrut karne kaa iraadaa, maal or seva kar (jiesti) kii shuruyaat, rajyon ko alpakaalik bijli aavashyaktaaon kii kharid ke liye ek rashtriya grid par jor or kai anya prayaas
 Work on many of these policies started even before the BJP came to power, but they are being appreciated very much under the idea of nationalism
 haal ke maheenon main, sarkaar ne ek raashtra, ek rashan card yojana shuru karne ke liye alag se sankalp jataayaa he, jiske tahat labhaarthi kisi bhi saarvajanik vitaran pranali ke tahat rashan kii kisi bhi dukaan se apana rashan le sakenge, jiske ve paatr hai
 The government has introduced legislation to create a single National River Water Disputes Tribunal
 vah sarkaar ke gathan ke liye sabhi staron par hone vaale chunaavon kii samay saarini ko suvyavasthit karne ke apane prastaav (ek raashtra, ek chunaav) ke saath bhi aage baduya chaahegi
 There is no guarantee that the result of simultaneous elections at the national and state level should be the same
 phir bhi ve rajnatik bahes kaa rashtriyakaran karne main madad karenge or chunaavon main matdaan ke dauraan rajya-vishisht muddon kii bajaae rashtriya muddon par logon kaa dhyaan kendrit karenge
 The discourse of a nationalism, which has increased since this year's Lok Sabha elections, is another form of political nationalization seen in Narendra Modi's first term as Prime Minister
 us kaarykaal main centre sarkaar ne centre pryojit sarkari yojanaon ko lagaataar centre sarkaar kii sampatti ke rup main darshana jari rakhaa
 In addition, the Center's emphasis on Aadhaar and direct benefit transfer resulted in the central government, rather than the state governments, as the distribution agency for welfare benefit schemes
 1989 or 2014 ke bich rajnatik kshetriyakaran ke yug main prachlit ek tark ke saath shrey kaa yah kendrikrut daawa khatm ho gaya
 In earlier times, state governments were more able to get a share in the credit of centrally sponsored schemes
 centre pryojit yojanaayen centre sarkaar dwaara dizin kii jaati thim lekin aamtaur par rajya sarkarein bhi isamen apane hisse kaa fund detii thim or un yojanaon ke karyanvayan kii jimmedaari bhi rajya sarkarein uthaati thim
 Many efforts to coordinate national policy and to break down inter-state barriers to trade and commerce have a long history
 2014 main centre main bhaajapa ke satta main aane se pehle hi jiesti, aadhaar, rashtriya grid jaisi nitiyon ko aage badhaayaa ja rahaa tha
 There are strong arguments behind such efforts for national coordination
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai rajyon ne rashan card portability ke saath kuch samay ke liye prayog kiya he taaki rashan card-dharakon ko aasapaas kharidari karne kii anumati mil sake or jisase rashan dukaanon ke pradarshan main sudhaar ho sake
 Creating a national plan has the potential to address the rights of migrant laborers who struggle to exercise their rights outside their home states
 haalanki, ek rashtrawaad ke agenda ke hisse ke rup main ek saath in nitiyon ko prastut kiya janaa bharat ke sangheey santulan se judi chunautiyon ke bare main chintaaen paidaa karata he
 Among regional parties, the DMK has been the most vocal critic of one-nation policies
 usne ek raashtra, ek rashan card yojana kaa bhi virodh kiya he
 DMK President M
 ke
 "public distribution is a fundamental right of state governments," says Stalin
 kendriya khaadya mantri ko yah samaj nahin aata ki is adhikaar kaa ulanghan hota he, to kya hoga
 It should be understood that the Center is trying to establish its dominance by implementing such initiatives
 ''saarvajanik vitaran pranali ke karyanvayan main rajya sarkaron ko darkinar kiye jane kii ashanka kii samvedansheeltaa, aise kadam ke chunavi nihitarth bhi maaloom hote hai
 The National Election Study 2019 data from lokniti-csds provide an insight into changing ways
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki alag-alag nitiyon ke liye matadaata centre yaa rajya sarkaron ko maanate hai
 That is, they differentiate between the responsibilities of the state and the center
 rajeshwari deshpandey, ke
 K
 kailash ke saath maine bhi is data kaa vishleshan kiya he or is nishkarsh par pahunche hai ki matadaata abhi bhi peedies kaa shrey apni rajya sarkaron ko dete hai
 This paper is about to be published
 iske vipareet, matadaataaon main manaregaa yaa ayushmaan bharat jaisi yojanaon kaa shrey rajya sarkaron kii bajaae centre sarkaar ko adhik dene kii sambhaavna dikhti he
 Thus a national ration card scheme would probably challenge states in a policy framework in which they have been the leading players
 iske saath hi, centre sarkaar pichley vitt ayog dwaara shuru kiye gaye adhik se adhik rajkoshiya vikendrikaran ke raste main rode atakane or yahaan tak ki usase palatate hue centre or rajyon ke bich rajkoshiya sambandhon ko phir se santulit karne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 This has given rise to the notion that steps are being taken towards centralization in both political and economic autonomy of the states
 sanghavaad ko lekar bhaajapa kaa drushtikon hindutv ke centre main gadhi gai vaicharik paribhaasha par aadhaarit he
 Nevertheless, the BJP adapted itself to federalism due to its large rise as a national power
 indira gandhi ke kaarykaal ke baad ke charnon ke dauraan bhaajapa ne tark diya tha ki nirankush vyavastha ko rokane ke liye ek majboot centre ke saath-saath majboot rajyon kii bhi aavashyaktaa he
 It was at the state level in the two decades prior to 2014 and the BJP developed and expanded its base by formulating specific state-level political and economic agendas
 modi sarkaar ko doosraa kaarykaal 2019 ke chunaavon main har pradesh or har jati ke hindu matadaataaon ke bhaajapa ke peeche majbootee se khadey ho jane ke kaaran mila he
 It is on this basis that in recent decades it is moving away from its approach to federalism with a more vigorous agenda of nationalism
 yah agenda bharat ke rajyon kii rajnatik or aarthik swaittata ko chunauti detaa he, jabaki sanghavaad kii niti or raajnneeti ko aakaar dene vaale nae vichaaron kaa naagarikta kii bahustareey sankalpana se jude mahatvapurn nihitarth bhi hai

 The Pakistan Election Commission has refused to register Hafiz Saeed's Milli Muslim League (MML) as a political party
 lihaaja uske pratyaashee ab milli muslim lig ke tikat par chunaav nahin lard paaenge
 Terrorist Hafiz has renamed his organization jamaat-ud-dawa to form the Milli Muslim League
 milli muslim lig sicurity clearence hasil karne main vifal rahi, jiske chalate pakistan chunaav ayog ne uskaa panjikaran aavedan khaarij kar diya
 Now Hafiz Saeed has no other way than to field his nominees in the general election, independent or to tie up with a small political party
 wo is aam chunaav main 200 se zyada pratyaashee maidan main utaarne ja rahaa tha
 This is not the first time that the Pakistan Election Commission has canceled the registration of the Milli Muslim League
 isse pehle ayog ne milli muslim lig ke lahore kii NA-120 seat se upachunaav ladane par pratibandh laga diya tha, jiske baad iske ummidavaar ko nirdaleey chunaav ladanaa padaa tha
 However, during the election, the poster and banner of the terrorist Hafiz Saeed's picture were used indiscriminately
 hafiz aise badalata rahaa apane sanghathan kaa naam9 / 11 aatanki hamale ke baad hangaamaa machaa, to hafiz said ne duniya ko chakma dene ke liye apane aatankwaadi sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyyaba kaa naam badal diya or nayaa naam rakhaa jamaat-ud-daawa
 After this there was a 26 / 11 terrorist attack in Mumbai, then he played the same game again
 abaki jamaat-ud-daawa kaa naam badal diya or phir ek nayaa naam rakhaa taharik-e-hurmat-e-rasul
 Then it was banned, so a new political party was formed, the 'milli Muslim League' (MML)

 The dreaded terrorist Hafiz Saeed wants to become Prime Minister of Pakistan by winning the general election
 magar uski is khwaahish ko ek baar phir jhatka laga he
 First America and then China had given advice to Pakistan, America first said 'hafiz'
 phir china ne kaha gudby 'moulana'
 Overall, the time has come for Pakistan to call Hafiz Saeed as God Hafiz
 haal hi main pakistan ke sabase bade hamdard china ne saaf lafzon main kaha tha ki is musiibat ko mulk se baahar nikaalo, varanaa bahut pachhataaoge
 Because of allowing this terrorist to remain in the country without being arrested under international pressure, Pakistan will be in such a difficulty that even if he wants, China will not be able to get him out of this trouble

 This meeting would not have gone unnoticed if the 69-year-old Vedic had not posted a picture on Twitter on July 14 in which Tond, the let leader, Saeed, can be seen quietly listening to him

 Not only this, Vedic's alleged relationship with the RSS, proximity to Baba Ramdev and relations with the ruling NDA gave the Congress a sense of suspicion

 His meeting with Saeed may have been a juggle of propaganda that created an unprecedented uproar, but in reality the Pakistan Army, the real center of power in Pakistan, has sent an important message

 The absence of significant progress in the trial of the 26 / 11 Mumbai attacks in Pakistan has also hindered the Indian Prime Minister's visit
 27 may ko narendra modi ne bhale hi islamabad yatra kaa navaj sharif kaa nyauta kabool kar liya ho par suraksha pratishthan ke man main aaj bhi yah chintaa he
 As far as Saeed is concerned, he tried to clarify his position regarding a disputed meeting with an Indian in a July 14 tweet, "dr

 BJP, a nation, is trying hard to carry forward an election plan
 pradhanmantri narendra modi pehle hi saaf kar chuke hai ki ve ek saath chunaav karaane ke pakshdhar hai
 Just seven months after the formation of the government at the Center, in January 2015, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Relations, Law and Justice had simultaneously argued on the feasibility of elections
 lekin bhaajapa kaa yah khyaal vivaadon main fansata dikh rahaa he
 These are the advantages 1 - The end of the electoral cycle, where on an average more than five states hold elections every year and this puts a lot of burden on the parties and the electoral machinery
 chunaav ke liye sarkari karmchaariyon ko baar-baar nahin bhejnaa hoga3-suraksha sansadhano / shantipurna chunaav karaane ke liye pulicekarmiyon ke istemaal main kami4-kuch hi samay ke liye chunavi aachaar samhita lagu hogi jisase saamaanya sarkari kaamkaaj main baar-baar rukaawat nahin aegi
 While frequent elections, such obstacles are more
 5 - a low number of elections also helps to curb corruption and reduces the number of brokers and black money
 6 - Reduced opportunities to disrupt government process The loss will be 1 - Diversity and coalition politics will suffocate while this gives democracy a voice and it affects the behavior and electoral results of the voters 2-if If there is a majority government at the center, it will neutralize the anti-incumbency in the states and the relationship between the Center and the states will become that of the owner and the customer
 3 - The role of the regional parties will be reduced
 Can come because no opposition can move a no-confidence motion unless at that time it has the power to form a new government
 5 - It is parliamentary and Ignores the sense of order and federalism, 6-rashtriya or sthaneey muddon par logon ke vichaar or nirnay ko mila detaa he jabaki donon bilkul alag hai7-garibon ke vot ke adhikaar ko kam karata he

 aaj tak jitne bhi baandh bane, sadaken baniin, yah sab jameen adhigrahan ke kaaran hi ho paaya
 But the price of the land is what the farmers should get
 gujarat main vikaas ke kaam ke liye jameen kaa adhigrahan hota he or koi kisaan iskaa virodh nahin karata
 The state government does not snatch land from the farmers for the company
