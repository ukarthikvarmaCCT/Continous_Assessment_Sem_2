 Meanwhile, the Congress session was called in Kolkata

 Mamta Banerjee and other activists were working under the supervision of the leaders, meanwhile, the party got screwed over Kamalapati Tripathi

 One of these beliefs was that he used to eat only the Brahmin food

 Mamta Banerjee placed Subrata Da's instructions to Anas Chatterjee, who was handling the catering

 He told Mamta that i would need two people for help
 idhar mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) ke dimag main kuch or hi chal rahaa tha
 He was determined to challenge the beliefs of Kamalapati Tripathi
 monobina gupta apni kitaab ''didi : a polytical biography'' main likhti hai, 'mamata banerjee anima kii taraf mudin or kaha thik he
 
 
 
 meri do gaiyr bramhan sahyogi kamalapati treepathi ke liye khaanaa bana dengi or tum paros dena'
 Mamta Banerjee did the same
 kisi ko kanokan isaki bhanak nahin lagi
 On this statement, Mamata Banerjee writes in her autobiography "struggles of Existence", "now Kamalapati Tripathi is no longer in this world
 agar ve jinda hote or is ghatana kaa pataa lagata to mujhe pakkaa baahar kaa rasta dikhaa dete'
 Right from the beginning, Monobina Gupta, Mamata Banerjee has been challenging the 'old beliefs'
 or jaise-jaise siyaasi galiyaaron main mamata banerjee ke pair jame ve apane rukh paraor pukhta tareeke se kaayam dikhin
 Mamata Banerjee was interested in politics since her college days and from here she learned ABCD in politics

 From 1976 to 1980 she was the General Secretary of Mahila Congress

 She became the Minister of State in Human Resource Development, Youth Affairs and Women and Child Development Department in the Narasimha Rao government
 iske alaava mamata narsimha raav sarkaar main khel mantri ke taur par bhi banaai gayi, lekin baad main kuch matbhedon ke chalate is mantralay se unhone istipha de diya
 In 1999, Mamata Banerjee's party became part of the NDA government led by TMC BJP and Mamta was made the Railway Minister
 apane pehle hi rail bajet ke dauraan bengal ko lekar kii gai ghoshnaaon ko lekar unki aalochana bhi hui
 In 2001, when the Tehelka scam surfaced, Mamata Banerjee opted out of the NDA, but in 2004 she again became part of the NDA
 siyaasi uthapatak kaa daur jari rahaa or 2009 main vah sattarudh upie kaa hissaa baniin or duusari baar rail mantri kaa pad sambhala
 Meanwhile, Mamata Banerjee was also rooted in the politics of West Bengal and in the year 2011, her party won the assembly elections with an overwhelming majority, giving the slogan 'maa, Mati, Manush'
 mamata banerjee ne bengal main ajey maane jane vaale left kii sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkaa or mukhyamantri baniin

 The meeting with the Governor was to be held on the issue of the Tallisans
 The common meeting of Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP leaders with the Governor has been postponed amidst efforts to form a government in Maharashtra
 teenon dalon ke netaa shaam 4 baje ke kareeb rajyapal se milane vaale the lekin ab yah baithak philhal nahin hogi
 Leaders of the three parties were scheduled to meet the Governor today on administrative problems and problems of farmers in the state
 ab aage yah baithak kab hogi, iskaa vakt abhi tay nahin kiya gaya he
 According to the leader, who is busy in giving the details of the election expenses, all the leaders will not be able to go to the governor on time, which is why most of the leaders are currently busy giving details of the election expenses as their deadline ends on Saturday
 rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari se hone vaali mulaakaat ke mudda bhale hi kisaan hon lekin mana ja rahaa tha ki is mulaakaat ke jariye teenon dalon ke netaa sarkaar gathan par charchaa kar sakate hai
 The BJP, which emerged as the largest party in the elections, has refused to form the government first due to lack of numbers
 iske baad duusari badi party shivasena ne anya dal congress or ensipi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kaa faisla kiya he
 However, no firm agenda has been set on this and the three parties are working on the Common Minimum Agenda and talks are also going on on the sharing of ministerial posts
 in sabhi binduon par charchaa ke baad sarkaar banane kaa daawa rajyapal ke samaksh pesh kiya jayega
 Owing to everyone's claim on government formation, the governor has imposed President's rule in Maharashtra for a period of 6 months, because of not presenting any claim to form a government on behalf of any party
 is bich agar teenon dal milakar rajyapal ko vidhayakon ke samarthan vaala patr saunpte hai to unhen sarkaar banane kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 On the other hand, within the BJP, which has been away from the race for power, the desire to form the government again has arisen and the party leaders have claimed that their party will form the government in the state
 gauratlab he ki maharashtra main sattadhari bijepi or shivasena ne saath milakar vidhansabha chunaav ladaa tha
 In the election results, BJP emerged as the largest party with 105 seats, while Shiv Sena became the second largest party with 56 seats

 On November 6 at 11 am the union thinker S
 gurumurti ne varisht bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani se unke dilli ke 30 prithviraj road sthit nivas par mulaakaat kii
 Amidst the sweets and coffee sips, Chartered Accountant Gurumurthy tried to convince Advani that there was nothing unethical or legally wrong in the business activities of Chairman Nitin Gadkari
 lekin unki baat ko samajhane kii bajaae bijepi ke varisht netaa ne ulate gadakari ke istife kii maang kar daali
 The relationship between the Sangh and Advani has been growing ever since Advani was forced to relinquish the chair of the party president due to a 2005 comment on Muhammad Ali Jinnah
 adwani ke virodh se gadakari kaa bachaav karne ke sangh ke iraade ko or bal mil gaya he
 Equipped with the balance sheet and documents, Guru Murthy sat for two hours with Advani, Balbir Punj, a Rajya Sabha MP, to detail the financial dealings of the Purti Group and claimed that Gadkari was nowhere to be blamed
 gurumurti ne daleel di ki gadakari par lage aaropon kii vajah darasal ‘‘takneekee visangatiyaan” hai, na ki jaan-boojhkar kiya gaya bhrashtachar
 He admitted that the delay by the BJP president in extricating himself from corruption allegations proved costly for the party
 nateeja sifer rahaa
 When Arvind Kejriwal, who came to the political stage through the mass movement, showered accusations against him, at that time Advani was standing by him, but now his attitude has completely changed
 adwani ne gurumurti se kaha ki logon ke man main party kii jo chhavi thi, vah maili ho rahi he or gadakari kii shakhsiyat par lage chhinte saaf nahin hone vaale, lihaaja unhen 17 disambar ko apane kaarykaal ke khatm hone se pehle istipha de dena chahie
 As soon as Gurumurthy conveyed this to the top RSS leaders in Nagpur, he instructed them to meet other party leaders and gather support for their leader
 isi bich gadakari ko dilli ke 11 ashok road sthit party mukhyalay main shaam ko party kii kor samiti kii baithak bulaane ke liye kaha gaya, jisamen gurumurti ko bhi maujuud rahanaa tha
 An indecision has formed between Advani and the Sangh
 sangh ke ek netaa ne bataaya, ‘‘gurumurti ko jo sandesh dena tha vah spasht thah gadakari apana kaarykaal puraa karenge or unhen hataane ke liye sangh par koi dabaav nahin daalega
 "however, even if the Sangh agrees to remove Gadkari, it has no ready alternative
 unki daleel he ki isaki koi guarantee nahin he ki nae adhyaksh ko congress yaa party ke apane hi sahyogiyon ke shadyantr kaa saamana nahin karnaa padegaa
 a leader of the Sangh said, "people like Congress and Kejriwal will give their full energy to explore the war of their sheath and today, it is not really difficult to find anything in this era
" ”isliye philhal sangh ke liye jo hai so gadakari hi hai
 After comparing Vivekananda's IQ to Mafia kingpin Dawood Ibrahim, one of the Sangh's venerable heroes, he was cautioned to curb his bidding by giving him a slight sob
 vaise gadakari kaa doosraa kaarykaal company register kii jaanch par tikaa he
 BJP will not want Gadkari to come back to the chair, but top leaders are not unanimous about the successor
 vaise sambhavit vikalpon main rajnath singh or em
 The names of Venkaiah Naidu, who has already held the post of BJP president, besides senior vice-president Shanta Kumar are also mentioned
 kuch netaa aise bhi hai jo mahasoos karte hai ki sangh ke paas ant main lok sabha or rajyasabha ke vipaksh ke netaa—sushamaa swaraj yaa arun jetali main se kisi ek ko chunane ke sivaa koi or chaara nahin hoga
 The fight within the BJP is between the Sangh and non-sangh leaders
 jaswant singh, yashavanth sinha or shatrughna sinha jaise varisht netaaon ne, jo sangh se nahin jude hai, gadakari ke virodh main rajyasabha saansad ram jethmalani se haath mila liya he
 On November 2, Jethmalani wrote in a letter to Advani, "keeping Gadkari in the office of president will be a disaster for the nation and the BJP
 ” kaaphi nuksaan ho chukaa he, agar jamkar koshish kii jaae to ab bhi sab kuch sudhara ja saktaa he, or unhone gadakari ke istife kii maang kii
 Gurumurthy met Ram Jethmalani later in the evening but failed to change his decision
 jethmalani ne hairaani jataai ki ‘kuch hi ghanton main’ gurumurti ne purti group ke vistrut dastavejon ko padhakar gadakari ko fatafat clin chit kaise de di
 Meanwhile, on November 6, Gadkari went to meet Swaraj and Jaitley
 sutron ke anusaar swaraj ne gadakari ko party ke ‘sabase bujurg or sabase budhimaanya netaa ke liye pad chhodie kii salaah di thi
 It is believed that Sushma even said that the party should announce this on Advani's 85th birthday on 8 November
 iske baad gurumurti ne sushamaa se bhent kii or phir sushamaa ne aanan-fanan main gadakari ke samarthan main twit kar daalaa
 Says a BJP leader, "actually, Sushma wants to improve her relationship with the Sangh and she has been successful to some extent in this
 vaise bhi, unhen party main apane bhavishya ke bare main sochna he
 Advani ji will not stay there for a long time
 ”yah sahi he ki sangh abhi baikfoot par he, lekin bijepi par uske asar ko kamatar nahin aanka ja saktaa
 Amid the emerging new equation in the Sangh Parivar, Jaitley has kept a complete silence on the issue which in a way questions his support for Gadkari
 haal-philhal party main is tarah kii charchaa joro se hoti rahi he ki jetali majbootee ke saath gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke paale main ja khadey hue hai or modi ke saath gadakari ke asahaj rishton kii baat jagajaahir he
 According to sources, Jaitley also refused to hold a joint press conference with Sushma Swaraj in support of Gadkari after the core committee meeting, as both of them had done earlier in support of Gadkari
 kor cameti ne gadakari ke paksh main majbootee ke saath khadaa hone kaa faisla kiya or jetali ko party kii sthiti ko spasht karte hue bayaan taiyaar karne ko kaha gaya
 Jaitley agreed to this, but he refused to read this statement with Sushma
 tab is kaam kaa jimmaa party pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ko saunpa gaya
 The statement appealed to party colleagues to stand in favor with the BJP president
 bayaan main kaha gaya, ‘‘party kii aisi chhavi nahin jaani chahie ki vah media ke ek tabake or vipaksh ke abhiyaan ke dabaav main aa gai
 The allegations have no merit
 ” iske saath hi party netaaon ke is mudde par bayaan dene par pabandi laga di gai
 a party worker said, "there is an atmosphere of dilemma and turmoil within the party
" isamen andeh nahin ki sangh kii sthiti naitik rup se kamjor hui he, lekin party ke andar aisa koi nahin he jo iskaa virodh kar sake
 Advani has been more or less marginalized
 jethmalani kii yojana ke mutabik jaswant singh, yashavanth sinha or shatrughna sinha bhi bijepi kaaryakarini se istipha dene se hichak gaye
 "the organization will continue to support Gadkari," a senior Sangh leader told India Today
 unhone badi bebaaki se mana ki gadakari ko hataane se bijepi par sangh kii pakad dhili pad jaaegi
 He turned back and asked, "why should Gadkari resign?" a group of Congress and party is deliberately targeting them
 yadi ve istipha dete hai to ye tatv or majboot honge
 Then there will be more attacks on us because these people will consider us easy victims
 ”sangh anaavashyak rup se aam logon kii soch ko tavajjo nahin de rahaa
 Another Sangh leader analyzed the situation in this way, "we are not unnecessarily upset about what people think
" abhi to hamaare liye yah ahm he ki party ke log kya sochate hai
 Therefore, Gurumurthy was sent so that conflicting currents within the party could be curbed
 janata kii yaaddaasht bahut kamjor hoti he, vah jaldi hi gadakari ke khilaaf aaropon ko bhul jaaegi
 See, in spite of corruption charges, the Congress also pushed forward Salman Khurshid
 ”sangh jo bhi soche, lekin bijepi ke andar ek bada prabhaavshaalee khemaa aar-paar ke mood main najar aa rahaa he
 Many leaders are seeing the current situation as an opportunity to take a different path out of the shadow of the Sangh
 yah jarur he ki virodh ke swar mukhar nahin hai, lekin is tarah sochane waalon ko lagata he ki party kii chhavi ko jo aghat pahunchaa he, use durust karne kii jarurat he
 As Jethmalani, who is handling the front alone, said on November 7, "it becomes my responsibility to warn the party that its moral ground is weakening
 This is also undermining the strength of the party to fight against corruption
" yah janata ke saath dhokhaa he
 "for now Jethmalani has single-handedly raised the flag of protest, but he is confident that soon others will also have the courage to raise their voice for 'party and country'

 shuukravaar ko ajay devgan ne ek audio clip jari kar keake dwaara karan johar se film pramotion ke liye 25 lakh rupee lene kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 KRK, while giving his clarification on the matter, has accused Ajay Devgan of bribing him and making him a scapegoat with Karan Johar
 indian express akhbaar kii report ke mutabik,kearkene ek press conference bulaakar media ko kumaar mangat kii company ke naam kaa 3 karod kaa check dikhaakar yah sabit karne kii koshish kii unke kumaar mangat ke saath unke achche profeshnal or personal rishte hai
 Kumar Mangat is the one who is talking to KRK in the audio clip released by Ajay Devgan
 ajay devgan ke bijness partner or manager kumaar mangat kii keaarke sang is audio clip main hi is baat kaa khulaasa hua he ki keaarke ko karan johar ne unki aane vaali film 'e dil he mushkil' pramot karne or ajay devgan kii film 'shivaay' kii negative publicity karne ke liye 25 lakh rupee die hai
 Both these films are releasing on October 28 this year
 haalankikearakene press conference main yah kaha ki unhen karan johar ne koi 25 lakh rupee nahin die hai aisa unhone kumaar mangat ke sawaalon se bachane ke liye kiya
 KRK continued to target Ajay Devgan's statement regarding the matter
 ajay devgan ne bayaan diya tha ki is industry ke saath unka ek imotional conection he or keake jaise log industry ke maahaul ko kharaab kar rahe hai
 On this statement of Ajay, KRK said, 'ajay Devgan was a two-pronged human being before joining the industry and now he has become a billionaire
 unka industry ke saath koi bhaavnaatmak lagaav nahin he
 He only loves money
 unhone 'ection jackson' film ke buudhe produsar kii bhi koi madad nahin ki jab vah movie flop hone ke kaaran ghate se guzar rahe the
 When Yash Chopra died during the film Jab Tak Hai Jaan, everyone asked him to shift the date of his film 'son of Sardar' but he did not do so
 kya yahi he unka industry ke saath imotional conection
 KRK further said that Ajay Devgan is making him a scapegoat for a confrontation with Karan Johar
 or unke kandhen par bandook rakhkar karan johar ko nishaanaa bananaa chaahate hai
 It is difficult to say who is right and who is wrong in this entire controversy, but this kind of controversy about the film clash is probably first seen in the industry

 The department had also banned the sale of tobacco used in hookah after hookah bars, but even after this, tobacco is being sold in Gurgaon indiscriminately
 On receiving this information, the Drugs Control Department raided several shops in the Sadar Bazar of Gurgaon and seized huge quantities of tobacco

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke nateezon kii tasviir ab puri tarah se saaf ho gai he
 Out of 542 Lok Sabha seats, the results have come in 523 seats and it has also been decided that this time also the country will not get the Leader of the Opposition
 congress party is baar duusari sabase badi party banakar ubhari he, congress ke khate main kul 52 siten ai hai
 But it is still far from the figure required for the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 kyonki congress bamushkil 52 ke aankade par pahunchi he or loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa kaa pad lene ke liye 10 fisadi siton kii jarurat hoti he
 That is, it is necessary to have a total of 55 seats out of 543 Lok Sabha seats, only then a party gets the post of opposition leader
 lekin congress is aankade se teen siten dur he
 However, elections are yet to be held for the 543rd seat, in which case these numbers may also change according to the existing seats
 16veen loksabhaa yani 2014 main bhi kuch aisa hi hua tha, jab congress maatr 44 siton par simat gai thi
 Even then the Congress did not get this position
 loksabhaa main congress ke netaa bane mallikarjun khadge is pad ke liye puure paanch saal ladate rahe, lekin nahin mil sakaa
 Many times he also requested the Narendra Modi government of the Center to give this post, but it could not happen
 gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki tab vipaksh ke netaa rahe mallikarjun khadge khud bhi is baar chunaav haar gaye hai
 Now the question also arises that if the central government gives the post of leader of the opposition to the Congress, then who will take the command, or who will be the leader of their house from the Congress side
 kya khud rahul gandhi is pad ko sanbhaalenge, is par bhi charchaa he
 In which state, Congress got how many seats

 manoj chandran raat ke ekant main ek ajeeb tarah kii gatividhi main lag jaataa
 He would lock up in his room at midnight and then go out to meet his mother and sister before leaving for St
 Shanthal Higher Secondary School at Malamukal in Thiruvananthapuram at 7 am
 raat ke un syah palon ke dauraan vah akele karata kya tha?uski maa anu ko bete ke vyavhaar main aae achaanak badlaav se hairaani hoti
 But, she then convinces herself that her son is in his teens and probably feels the need to spend some time alone
 manoj kaa takneekee gyaan behatar tha or use desktop par computer game khelnaa raas aata tha
 Now he would spend his days on the Internet in solitude in his room
 anu ne sochaa, bete kaa yah nayaa shauk kishoravastha kii dhun se zyada nahin or adhik din nahin rahegaa
 He later came to understand that the changes in the behavior of the son were indicative that there was something big
 chetavanee ke sanketamanoj kii sone-jaagane kii aadat badal gai thi or vah chidchida ho gaya tha
 Even more emotional than before
 ek baar usne apni maa ko bataaya ki vah apane doston ke saath ek cancert dekhne ja rahaa he, lekin vah akele shankumugham bich par ja pahunchaa
 Once upon a time, he wandered alone in a nearby cemetery
 isi saal farvari main anu ne jab uske haath par pattee bandhi dekhi to manoj ne yah kahani gadhakar baat ko ghumaane kii koshish kii ki diwaar par chadhate samay use chot aa gai
 She showed her hands on Anu's insistence
 usne compas se apane haath par ''e", ''bi" or ''aai" akshar likhte hue gaharaa chira laga rakhaa tha
 When asked, he said, "just for fun
" " anu us din ko yaad karti hai jab manoj ne badi sahajata se maut kii baat bhi oochaal di thi
 He had told his mother, if he ever gets dead, will his heart break? Anu did not understand anything and screamed saying that it is better to die than discuss such things
 phir manoj ne hansate hue maa ko gale laga liya tha
 Although Manoj was irritated and started living aloof, he would sometimes accompany his mother
 unase filmon yaa skool ke shikshakon kii baaten karata
 Last November, Manoj also told his mother about the Blue Whale Challenge
 anu kahati hai, ''usne mujhe ek ajeeb task vaale online game ke bare main bataaya tha
 On completing the task, he was asked to go mad or commit suicide or to kill a loved one
 " anu ne jab yah jaananaa chaha ki aakhir vah aisa game kyon khelnaa chahta he to manoj sawaal taal gaya
 Panicked Anu asks the son to promise that he will not play this game
 manoj ne kasam bhi kha lee
 But on 26 July Anu and her husband D
 ramchandran ne bete ko bedroom kii chat se lataka paaya
 The two lodged a complaint at the Villappillasala police station, stating with confidence that the Blue Whale Challenge game was behind their son's suicide
 ek khatarnaak gameblue whale chalange, ek soshal media game he jiskaa naam whale kii is aadat se prerit he ki whale apane jivan kaa ant karne ke liye khud samudr tat par chali aati hai
 The game is reportedly developed by Russia's Philip Budekin
 may 2017 main giraftaar 21 varshiya philip ne kathith rup se sweekaar kiya he ki usne 16 schuli ladakiyon ko khudakushi ke liye uksaaya
 In his confessional statement, Budakin apparently stated that his aim was to rid the world of "organic waste" and that he was "cleaning the society" by "motivating the dying of happiness"
 mana jaataa he ki blue whale chalange ke pehle shikaar ne chaar saal pehle aatmahatya kii thi
 Since then the sport has caused 150 suicides in Russia, the United States, Britain, Italy, Brazil, Argentina and Portugal
 samajha jaataa he ki budekin is khel kaa ekmaatr administrator nahin he, jisamen 50 din ke bheetar 50 task puure karne hote hai or antim task main khilaadi ko apana jivan samaapt kar dena hota he
 26-year-old postman Ilya Sidarov was also arrested in June for his involvement in the game's administration
 haalanki, yah maamla utana bhi spasht nahin
 Wired magazine reported on it in May this year
 "online fact-checking website Snopes has found that, of course, there have been cases of youth committing suicide all over Russia during the last six months, but they have found this game No clear evidence linking to
 "bharat main aatmahatyaon kaa daurbharat main keval manoj kii hi aatmahatya ko is game se jodakar nahin dekha ja rahaa he
 The Kerala Police says that it is also investigating two other similar cases
 ek maamla 22 varshiya ity chaatr se judaa hua he, jisane july main aatmahatya kii jabaki doosraa palakkad main vaanijya kaa chaatr tha, jisane 30 march ko pariksha khatm hone ke din khudakushi kar lee thi
 In both cases, the family members of the youth registered cases referring to strange changes in the behavior of the children, which corresponded to other cases related to the Blue Whale Challenge
 in ghatnaon ke shikaar kishoron ke vyavhaar kathith rup se khatarnaak yaa asaamaajik the, jaise chat kii munder par chalanaa, kabristaan main akele bhatakana, tadake 4
 Watching horror movies at 20 o'clock or making a blue whale shape on your body
 is game main shikaar jaise-jaise antim ''chalange" kii ore badhata he, task khatarnaak hota jaataa he
 As if they are being prepared to die step by step
 maamla isliye or bhi jatil ho jaataa he ki blue whale chalange koi paaramparik shgemy nahin he
 Some people say that this game is played with a smartphone app
 manoj ke maamle main kerala police kii takneekee shakha sicredrome ne uske phone main aisa koi ap nahin paaya
 Actually, it is neither a traditional game nor an app
 isaki sambhaavna adhik he ki ''chunauti" dene vaale budekin or anya ''handler" apane shikaar tak pahunchane ke liye wike dotcom (fasebuk kii tarah roosi site) jaise soshal media citon ko hathiyaar banaate hai
 An individual is invited to play the game only when he or she shows some signs of psychological stress, depression or suicidal tendencies
 andaja he ki manovigyaan kaa chaatr rah chuke budekin ne ek manovaigyanik test bhi taiyaar kiya he jiskaa istemaal kisi ko game khilne ke liye aamantrit karne se pehle kiya jaataa he or unhen kadai ke saath bataa diya jaataa he ki baatcheet ke soshal media par maujuud record mitaate chalem
 Manoj's mobile is still in possession of the cyberdrome and he is under investigation
 manoj kii maut ke liye yah game jimmedaar ho yaa nahin, is cese ne sibar suraksha or kishoron ke maansik swasthya par gambhir sawaal jarur khadey kar die hai
 Suicide suicide psychiatrist Dr
 rajeev radhakrishnan or bangaluru nimahans main psycophormacologist dow
 Chittaranjan Andrade in an article titled "suicide: An Indian Perspective" in 2012 called "cyber suicide" an emerging trend
 ''sibar aatmahatya" kaa prayog aatmahatya yaa aatmahatya ke prayaas ke vaise maamalon ko ingit karne ke liye hota he jisamen internet kii bhoomika ho
 In today's digital world, the danger increases even more because there is neither someone to listen to their problems nor there is any way to overcome their frustration or loneliness in the real world and in such a way that is accessible to children worldwide
 It is very easy to get caught in the web of internet
 mumbai main ahaan foundation ke madhyam se 1,200 schuli bacchon kaa surveykshan karne vaali sonaali patankar kahati hai, ''chauthi se saatvin kaksha ke bachche digital duniya ke liye sabase aasaan shikaar hote hai
 "easy access to highly inappropriate content and ignorance of most parents about what is in it makes them extremely worried

 She says that during a recent session on cyber security, some children claimed to have played the "blue Whale Challenge" game themselves or knew children who had the game
 unhone bataaya ki uttar mumbai ke ek skool ke bachche ne unhen bataaya ki unke dost ko marine drive par jane or samudr ke kinare bani 20 foot oonchi diwaar par chalane ko kaha gaya
 He was also threatened with open words — if told to anyone, he would be killed
 patankar kahati hai, ''agar vah kahani bhi bana rahaa tha tab bhi use spasht rup se madad kii jarurat he
 That is why we recommend counseling
 "ahaan foundation ne pichley maheene skulon main sibar jaagrukta par 40 satr yojit kiye hai
 Patankar says, "of course parents or teachers have their hands and feet bloated, but wherever we arrived, almost everywhere children asked us how they could play this game
 " ''ethoemo" yaa ''fier of missing out" yaa peeche chhot jane kaa bhay jigyaasa paidaa karne main bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Professor Sujata Sriram, dean of the School of Human Ecology at the Tata School of Social Sciences (TISS), says that a child's curiosity often increases in adolescence
 umr ke is daur main jokhim uthaane kii pravriti sahaj hi aa jaati he
 Patankar sees this as part of the "overconfidence" of the children when they start thinking that "it could happen to others, but it won't happen to them
" " bachche khud ko itnaa hoshiyaar samaj baithte hai ki unhen lagata he ki na to ve iske aadi nahin honge, is vajah se kishor adhik aasaan shikaar ban jate hai
 According to Sumit Rathod, director and cyber security expert of IT service provider firm Version x Tech, the "blue Whale Challenge" is the most searched on the Internet these days

 "it has become a big trick," says Rathore

 But Rathore believes he has good news
 unka kahana he ki ve kai maheenon se ''game" main shaamil hone kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, lekin safal nahin ho paa rahe
 They see this as evidence that the Blue Whale Challenge is unlikely to have an impact on India

 He was talking about reports of Pakistan Foreign Policy Advisor Sartaj Aziz coming to Amritsar next month
 sartaaj agle maheene kii shuruyaat main afghanistan par bahurashtriya 'heart of asia' sammelan main hissaa lene amritsar aa rahe hai
 In this context, the question arises as to why there should not be bilateral talk between the two countries after the Uri attack and surgical action by Indian security forces in pok
 menon ne kaha ki sanybal ke istemaal yaa bharat dwaara seemaa paar aatankwaadi thikaanon par sargical strike kii simit upyogita thi
 "this is not going to change the mindset of the Pakistan Army sponsoring cross-border terrorism and inter-service Intelligence (ISI) and Jihadi Tanzim, nor is it going to destroy the terrorists' infrastructure," he said
 kuch badalane vaala nahin he
 Menon said that 'covert cross-border activities' have happened even during the tenure of previous governments, but Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government decided not to expose them to the public, because these attacks have far more consequences than affecting public opinion
 Were focused
 unhone kaha, yadi aapkaa uddeshy desh main hi janata kii raay ko prabhavit karata he to aapako iske parinaamon se nipatna hoga
 This usually increases the expectations of the people and then it becomes a challenge to control the increased expectations
 menon ne kaha, jis kshan aap janata ke bich jaaoge to ye anumaanit nattejey nahin aaenge, kyonki tab donon paksh isamen shaamil honge
 Both sides have to see that they are not scared
 manmohan singh in gupt gatividhiyon par ek kaaran se hi chup rahe or vah kaaran (unhen prachaarit nahin karnaa) abhi bhi vaid he

 punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ke ilaake main pichley vidhansabha chunaav se pehle hua 40 karod rupee kaa ek bada ghotaalaa saamne aayaa he
 Rs 40 crore was disbursed to the people here for the repair of new houses and houses, but the reality is different
 asal main ye paise gaanvvaalon ko mili hi nahin
 It is worth noting that between January 2011 and March 2012, just before the assembly elections, in some way government treasuries were opened for Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal's area
 piudie ne state infrastracchar fund ke 45 karod rupee garibon ko ghar banane ke naam par baante
 Of this, 40 crore rupees were distributed only in Muktsar, which is the district of Chief Minister Badal and his constituency Lambi also benefited from this
 baaki ke 5 karod paanch duusare jilon ke hisse main aae
 Without any project report, the date on which the PUDA distributed the money has now started raising questions
 hoicourt ke varisht vakil echsi aroda ke bataaya ki ek hi din main kis tarah siem badal ne disi ko 10 karod rupee jari karne ke aadesh die
 This election was just one month before the Code of Conduct came into force
 sirf mukhyamantri ke jile main hi raashi kaa bada hissaa diya gaya aisa kyon? iske peeche kya makasad tha, saaf he
 On the other hand, according to the information received through RTI, 19 thousand poor families in Muktsar district got the benefit of the scheme and six thousand families were given 35-35 thousand rupees to build a raw house and 13 thousand families got 15-15 thousand rupees
 They were given for repair, but when the NDTV team reached the village, it was found that most people were given only 15 to 18 thousand rupees
 isamen 5 hajaar ke check or baaki kaa building material baanta gaya
 The villagers say that this benefit was given only to the Akali Dal people and their close ones
 tippaniyan a villager, the government got 6 thousand bricks, sand and 18 sacks of cement for 5 thousand labors
 itane main makaan puraa nahin hua
 Everyone put their money
 sarkaar ne 10-15 hajaar or dene kaa vaayada kiya tha, lekin ab lagata nahin milegaa
 Another villager told that we never got any check, and got people, we had tried a lot
 yahi nahin mukhyamantri ke ilaake lambi ke gaanv bhai kheda ke liye badi rakam de di gai
 One and a half lakh rupees were also given for a house here
 is tarah lambi ke hi muddu kheda gaanv main bhi edablyooes makaan banaae gaye, lekin inamen itnaa ghatiya nirmaan hua ki ye rahane ke kaabil nahin hai
 Most are lying incomplete
 alot karnaa baad kii baat he
 The Congress has demanded an inquiry into the entire matter, but the Chief Minister is clearly denying any wrongdoing while away from the investigation
 prakaash singh badal ne kaha ki ye sara record disi ke paas hota he
 Accusers keep on accusing
 gauratlab he ki vidhansabha chunaavon se thik pehle janvari 2011 se march 2012 ke bich mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ke kshetra ke liye ek tarah se sarkari khajaane khol die gaye
 PUDA disbursed 45 million rupees from the State Infrastructure Fund in the name of building houses to the poor
 isamen se 40 karod rupee sirf muktsar main baante gaye, jo mukhyamantri badal kaa jila he or unke nirvachan kshetra lambi ko bhi iskaa phayda mila
 The remaining 5 crore came in the share of five other districts
 bina kisi project report ke piudie ne jis taarikh ko rupee baante us par ab sawaal uthne lage hai
 HC Arora, Senior Advocate of the High Court, told how CM Badal ordered DC to release Rs 10 crore in a single day
 ye chunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone se sirf ek maheene pehle kii baat he
 Why was such a large portion of the amount given only in the Chief Minister's district? What was the motive behind this is clear
 udhar, artiai ke jariye mili jaankaree ke mutabik, muktsar jile ke 19 hajaar garib pariwaron ko skim kaa phayda mila or chah hajaar pariwaron ko 35-35 hajaar rupee kaccha ghar banane ko baante gaye or 13 hajaar pariwaron ko 15-15 hajaar rupee ghar kii marammat ke liye die gaye, lekin enditivi kii team jab gaanv pahunchi to pataa chalaa ki zyaadaatar logon ko sirf 15 se 18 hajaar rupee die gaye
 5 thousand checks and the rest of the building material was divided into it
 gaanvvaalon ke kahana he ki ye phayda bhi akali dal ke logon or unke karibiyon ko hi mila
 The comments bakaul ek gramin, sarkaar ne 5 hajaar lebaron ke liye 6 hajaar inten, reta or 18 bori cement mila
 The house was not completed in this regard
 sabane apane paise lagaae
 The government had promised to give 10-15 thousand more, but now it will not be found
 ek duusare gramin ne bataaya ki hamen kabhi koi check nahin mila, or logon ko mila, hamane bahut koshish kii thi
 Not only this, a large amount of money was given to Bhai Kheda, the village of Lambi, the area of chief Minister
 yahaan ke ek ghar ke liye dedh lakh rupee bhi die gaye
 In this way, EWS houses were also built in Muddu Kheda village of Lambi, but they were so poorly constructed that they are not able to live
 zyaadaatar to adhure pade hai
 Allotting is later
 congress ne puure maamle kii jaanch kii maang kii he, lekin mukhyamantri jaanch kii baat to dur kisi bhi gadabadi se saaf inkaar kar rahe hai
 Prakash Singh Badal said that all these records are with DC
 aarope lagane vaale lagaate rahete hai

 Book Name - 24 Days 24 Sayings Writer - Dr
 praveen tiwariprakashak–mahavir publisharsmoolya–150 rupelekhak or tivi patrkaar praveen tiwari kii yah duusari pustak he
 In the sequel to his first book 'truth's Search', he has highlighted 24 exercises for personality development keeping in mind the youth
 pustak kahati he ki har safalataa ke saath aatmavishvaas badhata jaataa he, lekin ye bhi sach he ki safalataa unheen ko milti he jinamein aatmavishvaas hota he
 Confidence is not something that can be injected into one's body from outside
 jivan ke har bitate pal ke saath yaa to aap apane aatmavishvaas ko kamjor kar rahe hai yaa use majboot kar rahe hai
 How can someone else be influenced by you until you see your own impressive personality? apane vyaktitv ko swayan jaananaa aatmavishvaas ko majboot karne kii pehali seedhi he
 Because there is no shortcut, there is no shortcut to confidence
 aap ne acchhee taiyaari kii he, riyaj kiya he to aap main aatmavishvaas khud ba khud aa jayega
 When you go to the swimming pool, you will see that there is a lot of fear among the novice or new swimming learners, while there are many experienced swimmers who come and jump with a splash
 ve tairne kii nai nai takneekon ko bhi sikhte hai
 At the core of their confidence is practice
 unki shuruyaat bhi darate darate hi hoti he, lekin ek baar jab aap abhyast ho jate hai to aatmavishvaas main nirtanr vruddhi hoti jaati he
 Life is no less than a sea, in which the strength to leap with a splash is seen as confident
 yahaan bhi siikhnaa hi sabase mahatvapurn hota he
 Like learning, learning, winning, ups and downs, learning all these things is part of the art of living and learning the life of swimming
 abhyaas kaa abhyaas hi aatmbal ko badhaane kaa ekmaatr tarika he
 The habit of learning increases self-confidence
 aap apane jivan par gaur kariye or dekhie aapane aaj tak kya kya siikhaa he? aap paaenge ki jin vidhaon ko aapane siikhaa he unamem aatmavishvaas adhik hota he
 If you know that it takes some time to learn and some mistakes happen naturally in the early days of learning every art, then you can master in any discipline
 isamen dhairya or ichhashakti ke gun mahatvapurn hai
 Do not be disturbed, all novices have been wanting good personality, so do not be upset by looking at the habitual swimmers
 ve bhi kabhi nausikhie rahe honge or aap hi kii tarah unhone bhi sangharsh kiya hoga
 Trouble occurs when we start feeling ashamed of showing ourselves a newbie
 jahaan aapane swayan ko siikhaa hua maan liya, vahiin aapkaa vikaas baadhit ho jaataa he
 How far you can go is determined by how much practice you do
 seekhney kii nirantarata hi aapke aatmavishvaas kii vruddhi kii nirantarata he
 You can take training in many arts and disciplines beyond your workplace
 tamaam shodh is baat kii pushti karte hai ki jo zyada se zyada vidhaon ko seekhney main dilchaspee rakhte hai unka aatmavishvaas apekshaakrit badha hua hota he
 Keep practicing your efforts to improve your personality and you will find that you are able to show that confidence in both your normal life and professional life
 logon ke bich rahanaa, vibhinn paristhitiyon kaa saamana karnaa bhi ek abhyaas hi he
 There are many people who are usually extroverted, but in public forums or under special circumstances, their bellies are tied
 phir kai log aise bhi hote hai jo pehali baar main hi apane pradarshan se logon ko achambhit kar jate hai
 Practice is the only way to get confidence from drinking a tonic, for this continuous practice is the only way
 saarvajanik manchon par bolne kaa, likhane kaa yaa apane aap ko vyakt karne kaa koi mauka nahin chuknaa chahie
 But also keep in mind that if you do this without preparation, then failure will happen
 asafalataa kii tis aapako aage bhi aise pradarshnon se daraane lagati he
 Once this kind of fear hits home, then your confidence starts to weaken
 aatmavishvaas kii kamajori ek rog he
 Do not give it a place in your mind
 aatmavishvaas majboot karne se zyada jaruri he use kamjor karne vaali baton ke prati satark rahanaa
 Focusing on deficiencies rather than strengths weakens confidence
 jo he kii bajaay jo nahin he ki chintaa bhi samay or aatmavishvaas donon ko kamjor karti he
 Fear of failure and fear of what people will think undermines confidence
 jab vyaktitv nirmaan ko aap ek abhyaas kii tarah lete hai to aap in baton ko zyada behatar tareeke se mahasoos kar pate hai
 Amid the clamor of thoughts, this book throws light on simple, simple and simple exercises

 Under this decision, now the third slot in any government document other than men and women will have to be kept for the eunuchs
 ling bataane ke liye yaa gender bataane ke liye teesri category bhi hogi, jo centre or rajya sarkaron ko lagu karnaa hoga

 'let us tell you that the SP-BSP alliance has broken due to the by-elections in 11 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh
 loksabhaa chunaav main bade jor-shor se bane is gathbandhan main areldi bhi shaamil thi
 The day the alliance was formed, it seemed that now this grand alliance will not only affect the politics of Uttar Pradesh in the whole country and it seemed from the talks of BSP supremo Mayawati and SP President Akhilesh Yadav that there is good coordination between the two and Lok Sabha In the election, both together will stop PM Modi's Vijay Rath
 darasal yah aatmavishvaas gorakhpur, phulpur or kairana upachunaav main hui jeet ke baad kaa tha
 Even Mayawati did not allow Congress to join this alliance
 unka kahana tha ki uttar pradesh congress kaa koi vajood nahin he or bispi ko har baar congress ke saath gathbandhan kii vajah se nuksaan jhelana pad jaataa he
 While Akhilesh Yadav was in favor of inclusion of Congress
 lekin bispi supremeo ke ek bhi na chali
 The Mahagathbandhan was definitely stronger than the BJP in terms of vote percentage, but the BJP was very strong on the ground and its workers kept their full force, the result of which is in front of everyone

 kya dilli main jan lokapal bill kii fil laapata ho gai he

 If the opposition raised the question, the government's response was bound to be

 Because there is no 9 digit number in India, then the question of getting a call does not arise and there is no question of a blast
 phone sirf bydaree kii vajah se yaa over hit hone kii vajah se hi blast ho saktaa hai kisi kol se nahin
 Question: If a missed call is received from a number like + 371, + 375, + 377, then the other details of the phone including the contact can be copied if the call is made
 Answer: If a call comes from any such series, do not call back

 But none of your details will go anywhere from the phone
 aapako itani hi satarkta rakhni hai ki aap bina cross check kiye kol back naa karen

 Electricity, water and roads cannot be electoral issues, but monkeys can also be electoral issues
 chunaavon main netagan matadaataaon ko rijhaane ke liye tarah- tarah ke vaade karte hai or vot paane ke liye har samasya kaa samaadhaan dete hai
 a unique case related to the electoral issue has come up in two Vidhan Sabha constituencies of Saharsa district of Bihar

 Kaharlathi of monkeys for 15 years - The people of the village are ready not to deal with any enemy everyday, but to save their crop from monkeys

 10 hajaar kisaan hai prabhavitgaanvake ek aadmi ne bataaya ki bandaron ne lagbhag 10 hajaar kisaanon kii fasal barbaad kii he
 This problem was raised before the administration and the Bihar government, but no action was taken
 chunaav shuru hote hai or khatm bhi ho jate hai, par kuch nahin badalata
 During the election, the candidates promise to help them by winning the election
 saare vaade khokhale sabit hote hai
 If you go to vote, the monkeys will come here
 There is no demand of the voters, they just want to get rid of the monkeys
 gaanv ke logon kaa kahana he ki agar vevotdene jaaenge, tab tak bandar unki fasal barbaad kar denge
 The situation here has become so bad that instead of sending children to school, they are sent to fields for guarding crops
 gaanv kii mahilaayein bacchon ko khilne ke liye bhi kahin nahin jane detii hai
 The boycott of voting has been an election issue for many years because of monkeys' havoc
 is baar bhi saharsa main 5 november ko hone vaale chunaav main yahi chunavi mudda he
 Voters battered by false promises of leaders have decided to boycott voting
 gaay ke baad bandaris chunaav main gaay ke baad bandar hi surkhiyon main rahe hai
 During the third phase of the election, the monkeys in Bakhtiyarpur harassed voters

 Delhi Police considers Deepak as a companion of Lakshmi Narayan Meena
 deepak ne bataaya ki didie main 177 form nahin balki 500-700 farji form bhare gaye
 Initially Deepak felt that these people wanted to make their flat complete by filling 8-10 forms, but when the forms started being 10 to 100 and 100 to 500, Deepak realized that he had inadvertently become part of a big conspiracy
 deepak ke anusaar maamle kii jaankaree police ko di gai thi lekin police ne koi karrwai nahin kii
 Deepak also spoke about the involvement of DDA officials in this scam
 didie daawa kar rahaa tha ki uskaa ghar ghotaale se koi sarokaar nahin hai
 But now what will the DDA say
 ab sawaal ye he ki agar drow se pehle hi police ke paas is tarah ki shikaayat thi to jaanch kyon nahin kii gai
 Why the draw process was not stopped and why the DDA did not consider the need for investigation even after the complaint
 lakshmi narayan is ghotaale kii ek choti si kadi he

 Book: Not Just an Accountant - The Diary of Nations Conscience Keeper (english) Author: Vinod Raipblicher: Roopa publicationsedition: Hard Bound (288 pages) Price: 500 Rupees Despite the decision to release the book after the Lok Sabha elections, former CAG Vinod Rai's' Not Just an Accountant 'prime time has not been in the headlines on TV, but for anyone who wants to know about prime time scams, this book It is very important to read
 kitaab ke teen hisse hai- pehla hissaa lekhak or unki sanstha ke bare main pathakon ko avgat karaata he
 The second part postmortem the scams in 2G, Commonwealth, Colgate, Hydrocarbons (reliance) and Air India
 kitaab kaa aakhri hissaa vinod raay ke nijee vichaaron ko bayaan karata he
 The reason for writing this is the most special about the book
 kitaab likhane kii vajah congress yaa doctor manmohan singh ke khilaaf lag rahe aaropon kii bahati ganga main haath dhonaa nahin he
 However, in the second part of the book, about all the scams, it was said that the Prime Minister and his office deliberately ignored things or tried to mislead Parliament and the country in a cursory manner
 kerala cader ke adhikari rahe vinod raay ke sthaneey netaaon ke saath ke anubhav hon yaa tatkaaleen raksha mantri mulaayam singh yadav se ek vaayu sena sargent ke tabadale ko lekar hui nonk-jhonk, kitaab or audit report main jo fark hona chahie, wo is kitaab main he
 But in the second part, where the authors are putting the big scams in front of the readers with the pen of the former CAG, not an inch of subjective sentiment or core gossip is given
 jo bhi kaha gaya he tathyon ke aadhaar par kaha gaya he
 Apart from solid evidence of government involvement or apathy in curbing corruption at the highest level, reading the book makes one feel as if all the important scams have been heard together, like the news that has been in the headlines throughout the year on New Year's Eve
 shaayad vinod ke liye kitaab likhane kaa kaaran bhi yahi rahaa ho
 On the one hand, Vinod Rai, as a CAG, was seeing the plunder of national wealth and resources in front of the eyes and on the other hand the entire political system of the ruling party was trying to prove him as the villain
 vinod raay ne ek baar kalam uthaa lene ke baad nishchit taur par is 'diary' ke jariye sirf apana bachaav karne ke bajaay bhavishya ke liye kuch maapdand nirdhaarit karne kaa bhi kaam kiya he
 In other words, it can be said that through this book, the moral responsibility has been left on the present government to fix the responsibility for the mess done in the last ten years
 jiske daayre main sirf netaa nahin bijnesaman or naukarshah bhi aaenge
 Rai has stated in the book the need to change such policies, which are prone to disturbances
 yah dekhnaa padegaa ki kisi radio prasaaran yaa vijaydashami kii bhaashan main in maapdandon par khara utarane ke prayaason kaa hisaab diya jaataa he yaa nahin
 Rai ends his talk with the hope that the energy students of Delhi showed in the 2012 protests is a revolt against the system rot in the country and this is our greatest hope
 raay ne kitaab main is baat kaa zikr kiya ki unki najar main shikshit or shahari madhya varg kaa raajnneeti main aana sabase badi ummid he
 Which will lead the country towards superiority
 yahi ek hissaa he, jahaan lekhak ke saath bahes kii gunjaaish he
 The mass movements that Rai referred to, will undoubtedly prove to be a milestone in the history of the country, but to expect that we will win over corruption or corporate plunder is far-fetched
 kitaab kuch jaruri muddon se achhuti rahi
 Scams either cause damage to the exchequer or revenue to come
 is paise kii sabase zyada jarurat jansankhya ke sabase nichle hisse ko he jo bhojan, shiksha, swasthya aadi moolbhoot suvidhaon ke liye bhi mohataaj he
 This section has had to bear the biggest brunt of corruption caused by government revenue
 vikaas dar bhale hi kai guna bad gai ho, saamaajik kharche main koi khaas vruddhi nahin kii gai he
 Perhaps this is why the government has never felt the heat of lack of revenue politically
 aaj yah tabaka sankhya main sabase bada he
 But the weakest to create political pressure
 amartya sen hon yaa chunavi bhaashan

 puranic manyataon ke anusaar, lankapati ravan ne yah jyotirling yahaan laayaa tha
 According to the Shiva Purana, Shiva gave Ravana a desired boon, pleased with his penance
 ravan ne bhagwaan shiv ko kailash parvat se apane saath lanka le jane kii ichha vyakt kii thi
 Lord Shiva himself refused to go to Lanka, but advised his devotee Ravana to be taken to Jyotirlinga
 saath hi shart laga di ki ise agar raste main kahin dharti par rakhaa, to yah vahiin sthapit ho jayega, vahaan se koi use uthaa nahin paaegaa
 Here, Lord Vishnu did not want the Jyotirlinga to reach Lanka
 unhone ganga ko ravan ke pet main samaane kaa anurodh kiya
 As soon as the Ganges engulfed Ravana's stomach, Ravana felt intense grief
 vah sochane laga ki kisko jyotirling saunpkar vah laghushanka se nivrutt ho
 At that moment Lord Vishnu disguised as a cowherd appeared there
 ravan ne gwaale ko jyotirling saunp diya or hidaayat di ki jab tak vah na aae, tab tak jyotirling ko vah jameen par na rakhe
 Ravana began to take a short breath, it took a long time for him to retire from the influence of Ganga
 vah jab lautaa, to gwaala jyotirling ko jameen par rakhkar vilupt ho chukaa tha
 After this Ravana tried a lot to lift the Jyotirlinga, but could not succeed, he had to return to Lanka empty-handed

 For this reason, the name of this Jyotirlig became Vaidyanath
 devgarh ke balanand sanskrit mahavidhyalay ke praachaarya dow
 Mohananand Mishra told, 'the story of this Jyotirlinga is described in various Puranas, but this story is detailed in the Shiva Purana
 varnit he ki vaidyanath jyotirling kii sthapana swayan bhagwaan vishnu ne kii thi
 The place where this Jyotirlinga is known, has many popular names
 jaise haritaki van, chitabhumi, rankhand, rawaneshwar kaanan, hridaypeeth
 'there is a lot of importance to visit Vaidyanath Dham in Savan

 tata samooh kaa mutual fund tata select equity fund desh kaa pehla aisa fund he, jisane sharaab yaa tambaakoo kshetra main nivesh nahin kiya he
 Regarding the steel industry, Irani said that there should be no export of iron ore
 unhone kaha ki kores main sudhaar ho rahaa he par pashchim main samasya kii vajah se utpaadan kam bana hua he
 When asked about Tata Steel, he said that by next year it will have a production capacity of 10 million tonnes
 pakistan ke piem navaj sharif dohari chaal chalane ke chakkar main apane ghar main hi ghir chuke hai
 After the recent incidents on the indo-pak border, under the increasing pressure of the world fraternity, the activities of Sharif's government and army have started to take place in his country
 vipakshi partiyaan navaj sharif sarkaar par naakaara hone kaa aarope laga rahi hai to sharif ke party ke netaaon ne hi baghawat kaa bigul phoonk diya he
 The pressure increased so much that the Pakistani government was forced into an operation against terrorism
 uri hamale ke baadanwaj sharifne behad chaalaaki se duniya ke saamne pakistan ko paak-saaf sabit karne kii koshish kii
 If the Indian Army carried out a surgical strike in pok, Pakistan's rulers refused to consider it a surgical strike
 ise bharat kii ore se sijafire kaa ulanghan kii ghatana qaraar kar isapar pardaa daalane kii koshish kii gai
 But both these incidents once again showed the world that the terror factory is running in Pakistan and the rulers there are instigating it
 modi se najdiki kyon?donon mulkon ke bich jari tanaav ke bich sarhad par pakistani sainikon kii tainaati badha di gai he
 But the political situation in Pakistan intensified due to the current situation
 pakistan taharik-e-insaaf ke netaa imran khan ne navaj sharif par bhartiya piem narendra modi se nazdikiyaan badhaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Imran has said that Nawaz Sharif gave wrong signals to Narendra Modi, due to which Pakistan is on the verge of being isolated in the world today
 imran ne navaj sharif or unke parivaar par bhrashtachar main gale tak duube hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki wo pakistani avam ke paison kii barbaadi kar rahe hai
 Questions about Hafiz are being raised in Pakistan against the most wanted terrorist of India, Hafiz Saeed
 sattarudh pakistan muslim lig-navaj (piemail-en) ke saansad rana mohammad afjal ne hafiz ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii he
 Afzal said, 'what eggs does Hafiz Saeed lay that is why we have kept him
 pakistan kii videsh niti kaa haal ye he ki ham aaj tak hafiz said ko khatm nahin kar sake
 India has created such an image of Pakistan in the world about Hafiz Saeed that when Pakistan talks about the issue of Kashmir in the world, the officials there say that the relations between the two countries are bad due to Hafiz
 'aatank par paak army kii chotpakistani hukmaranon ko ab samaj main aa gaya he ki unki 'aatank kii dukandaaree' ab zyada din nahin chalegi
 Perhaps this is the reason why the Nawaz Sharif government has asked its army to crack down on terrorists
 pakistani media main aa rahi khabaron ke mutabik pakistan sarkaar ne sena se saaf lahaze main kaha he ki aatankwaad par jald lagaam nahin lagaai gai to ham puri duniya main alag-thalag pad jaaenge
 Sharif has also directed that the Pathankot attack probe should be completed at the earliest and the trial be resumed in Rawalpindi court taking action on the files related to the dusty Mumbai attacks
 sharafat kii nikali havauri hamale ke baad yuan kii mahasabha ko sambodhit karte hue navaj sharif ne kashmir kaa masalaa uthaakar aatankwaad se apana daaman bachaane kii koshish kii phir pakistan ne china ke jariye takneekee pench fansaakar aatanki masood ajahar ko sanyukt raashtra kii suraksha parishad kii jad se bachaane kaa daanv khelaa
 But after India and other neighboring countries boycotted the SAARC summit, Pakistan suffered a major setback on the diplomacy front
 sargical strike ke baad pakistani avam main aakrosh panpane laga to navaj sharif sarkaar ne sansad kaa sanyukt satr bulaayaa
 From this platform too, Nawaz once again cried the rant of Kashmir and the conversation for peace restoration
 haalanki imran khan kii party ne is sanyukt satr kaa bahishkaar kiya
 Targeting the ISI, Shahbaz Sharif, Chief Minister of Punjab province of ISI, said that people sitting in the system become active as soon as they act on terrorist organizations
 is masale par shahbaaj or iesai pramukh rigwan akhtar main talkh bahes bhi hui
 At the same time, Pakistan Foreign Secretary Ejaz Chaudhary said that the country is being isolated by diplomacy
 duniya ke bade desh hamaari baton par dhyaan nahin de rahe
 Even though China has supported Pakistan, it has indicated that Pakistan should bring change in itself
 pioke main sadakon par utre logpakistan sarkaar bhale hi daawa kare ki vahaan koi aatankwaadi camp nahin he
 But the people of pok are exposing this lie
 in dinon ilaake ke log paak hukmaranon or aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf sadakon par hai
 People have warned that if the government of the Taliban, jaish-e-mohammed, lashkar-e-taiba and other terrorist organizations does not close the camp, then the people themselves will destroy the camp
 pioke ke vibhinn hisson main chal rahe aatanki campon ke khilaaf sthaneey logon ne guuruuvaar ko virodh pradarshan kiya
 People say that their life has become like hell due to terrorist camps
 is tarah tamaam koshishon ke baavjood sharif sarkaar kaa sankat dur nahin ho sakaa he
 Trouble is yet to increase
 ek ore, navaj sharif sarkaar ke aadesh par sena or surakshabalon ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf abhiyaan shuru kar diya he lekin faisalabad main isi tarah kii chhapemari ke dauraan sharif kii hi party ke teen netaaon ke ghar gaiyrkanoonee hathiyaar baraamad hue hai
 After this incident, the operation against terror has been stopped

 BJP has opened a front against Chidambaram

 ’’ chidambaram ne kaha ki adhik swytta ke sawaal par 'gambhirtha se vichaar karnaa' chahie or is par vichaar karnaa chahie ki kin kshetron main swaittata di ja sakati he
 Chidambaram's advice not needed: Ram Madhav said, 'his autonomy is completely under the Constitution of India

 This employment sector has dried up

 If the competition was so concerned, why did the government not offer 4G to BSNL and which private company benefited more by not giving it? Find the answer to such a simple question yourself

 While people will also be removed from this sector and new jobs are about to be closed
 saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyon main bhartee aani to kab kii kam ho chuki he yaa band ho chuki he

 Now all these should come forward and rally in favor of privatization
 dharmendra pradhan ke bayaan kaa swaagat karnaa chahie kyonki modi sarkaar kabhi galat kar hi nahin sakati he
 Today, when their officials meet at the airport or station, they surround me

 The minister should tell how the competition in the oil sector will reduce prices? What is the evidence of this? Is this thing being said on the basis of any study or on this basis, when we have to win the election in any case, then say anything, what difference does it make? If the oil companies are being sold in the name of the common man, then the common man should also tell something
 pradhan kaa hi bayaan he ki loktantr desh ke aam logon ke liye patibaddh he
 We have to create an easy life through openness
 utpaada mahatvapurn he lekin koun chalaa rahaa he ye mahtavpurn nahin he
 It seems that the next day after the sale of BPCL, petrol will be Rs 50 per liter
 raajnneetik safalataa ise kehete hai
 You can sell this theory to the people standing in front of the line that in order to overcome your problems, you are selling the oil company to a private Seth
 notebandi ke din yah bayaan chapa he
 Perhaps it is also a salute to the public in such a way that this time too, they will take such decisions in line and consider them nationalistic

 SP BSP alliance: BSP supremo Mayawati has said that Yadav votes have not been transferred in favor of BSP (lok Sabha Elections 2019) in favor of BSP, hence BSP is now going to 11 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh i will fight alone
 haalanki bispi supremeo mayawati (mayawati) ne is faisle ko lekar koi aupchaarik elaan nahin kiya he lekin unhone yah baat apni party ke netaaon ke saath baithak main kahi he
 At the same time, SP (SP) President Akhilesh Yadav is currently in Azamgarh and is addressing the rally there
 is khabar ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki uttar pradesh main mahagathbandhan (SP BSP alliance) main daraar pad gai he
 Mayawati's statement came at a time when the Samajwadi Party is reviewing how much profit or loss has been made on the alliance with the BSP
 gauratlab he ki uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party ko maatr 5 siten ai hai or pichley chunaav main ek bhi siten na jeet paane vaali bispi ko 10 siten mil gayi
 After this result, inside the Samajwadi Party, it was discussed inside that the bsp's vote has not been transferred to the SP
 is baat kii ashanka sapa ke sansthapakamulaayam singh yadav ne pehle hi jataa di thi or unki baat sahi sabit hui
 Significantly, despite the alliance with the BSP, the Samajwadi Party has got only five seats
 itnaa hi nahin sapa ke durg kahe jane vaale kannauj, badaayun or firozabad main parivaar ke sadsy chunaav haar gaye
 Many people also say that in the seat sharing of the alliance, Mayawati took the seats as per her wish
 voton ke adaan-pradaan ke lahaze se dekhen to jin 10 siton par basapa ne jeet darj kii he, vahaan sapa 2014 main duusare sthaan par thi
 This is why the SP failed
 nagina, bijanour, shravasti, gajipur siton par sapa ke paksh main sameekaran tha
 The second reason is that the chemistry of the alliance did not reach the ground
 sabhaaon main bheed dekhakar inhen laga ki hamaare vot ek-duusare ko transafar ho jaaenge
 But this did not happen
 " mayawati ko yah maaloom tha ki muslim votaron par mulaayam kii vajah se sapa kii acchhee pakad he
 Mayawati benefited from this
 mayawati ne jeetne vaali siten apane khate main le lee
 In many seats, the BSP candidates lost by a very small margin
 isamen meerut or machhlee shahar shaamil hai

 According to political analyst Rajendra Singh, "the SP-BSP leaders formed an alliance in the election, but it did not like the cadres at the district and block levels
 aadhi siten duusare dal ko dene se us kshetra vishesh main us dal ke jila yaa blaak stareey netaaon ko apana bhavishya andhakaarmay dikhne laga
 "the result of all this is that sp's vote percentage is 22 in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 35 pratishat se ghatakar is baar 17
 It was 96 percent
 vot pratitshat basapa kaa bhi gata, lekin uske vot siton main badal gaye
 BSP 19 in 2014 general election
 77 pratishat mat mili the, jo is baar ghatakar 19
 26 percent remained

 If there is a power cut in the capital Delhi for more than 2 hours, then the power companies will have to pay damages
 up rajyapal anil baijal ne isaki anumati de di he ki agar 2 ghante se zyada bijli kii katautee hui to upabhokta ko us ilaake main bijli supplai karne vaali bijli company harjaana chukaayegi
 In this regard, CM Arvind Kejriwal met LG Anil Baijal and took his permission
 aadhe ghante tak chali baithak ke baad kejariwal media se to nahin bole, lekin khud twit karke isaki jaankaree di ki alji se anumati mil gai he
 The Delhi government had decided to pay the compensation last year, but it was not implemented due to not getting permission from LG at that time, but this year with the power cut due to the power cut, the government decided to make the power companies accountable
 Also got permission from LG
 ab ummid kii ja rahi he ki jald hi ye faisla lagu ho jayega
 In fact, the Delhi government has decided to impose penalty on electricity companies on an hourly basis for cuts of more than two hours
 ye jurmaana pehle do ghante main 50 rupee or uske baad 100 rupee prati ghante ke hisaab se graahakon ko bijli bill main hi diya jayega
 The comments faisle ke mutabik, vidyut adhinium 2003 kii dhara 108 ke tahat jurmaana tay kiya gaya he
 According to this, now power cuts of more than two hours will not be allowed
 agar transfarmar fail ho gaya ho to us sthiti main do ghante ke andar ise sudhaarney yaa 72 ghanton main iskaa koi doosraa vikalp nikaalnaa hoga
 If the power companies fail to do so, they will have to pay a penalty of Rs 50 for the first two hours and Rs 100 per hour after two hours

 He said that he is not aware of this

 Many have been hospitalized in critical condition
 jahrili sharaab hone vaali maut kaa yah tandav koi nayaa nahin he
 Even before this, hundreds of people have fallen into the cheeks of the premature period
 haal hi main upi kii rajdhani lakhanu main bhi jahrili sharaab se kareeb 50 logon kii maut hui thi
 Now the question arises, how does raw alcohol become poisonous? You will be surprised to hear about the process of making it
 ji haa, kachi sharaab ko banane main istemaal hone vaali mahue kii lahan ko sadaane ke liye kute kaa shouch or oxitosin kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 At some places, salmon and urea are also added to it
 aise ban jaati he jahrilikachi sharaab ko adhik nashili banane ke chakkar main jahrili ho jaati he
 Generally, it is prepared from jaggery, molasses in making it
 lahan ko mitti main gaad diya jataahe
 Urea and basambel leaf are added to it
 adhik nashili banane ke liye isamen oxitosin mila diya jaataa he, jo maut kaa kaaran banati he
 In some places, to make raw liquor, 100 kg of East and urea in five kilograms of jaggery are mixed and buried in the soil
 yah lahan uthne par ise bhatti par chadha diya jaataa he
 When the steam rises after heating, the alcohol is released from it
 iske alaava sade santare, uske chhilake or sade gale angoor se bhi lahan taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 How is the methyl alcohol formed due to the addition of chemical substances such as urea and oxytocin to the alcoholic alcohol
 isaki vajah se helogon kii maut ho jaati he
 Chemical reaction intensifies as methyls enter the body
 isse sharir ke andruni ang kaam karnaa band kar dete hai
 Due to this, many times they die instantly
 kuch logon main yah prakriya dhire-dhire hoti he
 Lalit Modi sent a defamation notice to England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Giles Clarke, who accused the suspended IPL commissioner of plotting to destroy the structure of the world and English cricket
 modi ke manahani ke notice main clark ke do may ko bisisiai adhyaksh shanshaak manohar ko bheje gayi email kaa zikr he, jisamen isibi ke sheersh adhikariyon ne nilambit ipel ayukta par antarrashtriya cricket parishad ke niyam kanoonon kaa ullaghann kar england main baagi lig shuru karne kaa vichaar banane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 According to sources close to Modi, this notice has been sent to Clarke by his lawyer based in London, Carter Ruck, and has given the ECB chief seven days' time for complete and unconditional apology
 modi ke kanoonee salaahkaar mahmud abdi ne bhi isaki pushti kii
 In the notice, Modi has said that Clarke's allegations are based on his meeting in Delhi on March 31, in which representatives of three English counties attended
 modi ne notice main kaha ki clark ke daawey ‘saraasar jhooth hai or vah kabhi bhi vishwa main kahin bhi is tarah kii gaiyr manyata praapt cricket lig kii yojana nahin bana rahe the, jise isisi yaa isisi ke sadasyeey sanghon kii manjuuri nahin mili ho
 ' india today par karan thapar ko die ek intervyuu main purv kendriya mantri arun shouri ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi homeopathy vibhaag main koi section adhikari nahin hai, unhen ashishnutaa par baat kerani chahie
 Shourie said that it can be very dangerous to call PM Modi the biggest victim of intolerance
 shouri ne shairana andaaj main kaha-tujhse pehle jo yahaan takhtanaseen tha usko bhi khud pe khuda hone ko yakeen tha
 
 
 The behavior of the Prime Minister has brought him to the level of red and made Nitish Kumar a politician
 pradarshnakariyon ko pagal kahana sahi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa kyonki is pradarshan main raav, raghuram rajan, bhargav or admiral ramdaas jaise buddhijivi shaamil hai
 Questioning the pm's silence over the pm's failure to play his responsibility, Shourie said that PM Modi can tweet without tweet, but is silent on the Dadri incident
 piem apni naitik jimmedaari nibhaane main naakaam sabit hue hai or unhone apane pad kii shapath kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Shourie cited Modi's tweets on issues such as the birthday of Union Minister Mahesh Sharma, the birthday of James Cameron, the stampede in Mecca and the Ankara blast after the Dadri incident
 purv kendriya mantri ne kaha ki unhone haryana main do dalit bacchon kii hatya jaisi ghatnaon par chuppi saadhe rakhi
 He remains silent, while his party colleagues and ministers keep the issue alive
 modi kii chuppi raajnneetikyah puche jane par ki kya modi kii chuppi raajnneetik he, unhone kaha, ‘ mujhe aisa lagata he
 You cannot walk both ways
 aap bahut majboot netaa hai, lekin aap apane sadasyon ko niyantrit nahin kar sakate
 Referring to Sharma's controversial remarks on former President Abdul Kalam, he said that allotting the house in which Kalam lived was "like spitting in people's mouths"
 ’bharat ko banaaya ja rahaa pakistaiarun shouri ne kaha ki piembharatako pakistan bana rahe hai kyonki unke liye bihar chunaav jeetna bharat ke bhavishya se zyada mahatvapurn he
 Like Pakistan, social conflict is being threatened in India
 asraar-ul-haq majaaz ishk ke shaayar the yaa inkalab ke, dard ke shaayar the, yaa khvabgah ke, amiri ke shaayar the yaa abhaav ke
 
 
 Everyone was together unka janm 19 aktubar, 1911 ko uttar pradesh ke barabanki jile ke rudauli gaanv main hua tha
 His father's name was Chaudhary Siraj ul Haq
 choudhary siraaj ul haq apane ilaake main pehle aadmi the, jinhone vakaalat kii degree hasil kii thi
 He was a government employee in the registry department
 jaahir he us jamaane main us ilaake ke vah bade log the
 Walid wanted his son to study and become an official employee, engineer like him
 lihaaja primary kii padhai ke baad unhone majaaz kaa daakhila agra ke saint jans kalege main karaayaa
 But something else was written in Mazaz's luck
 agra main majaaz ko faani badayuni, jajbi, maikash akbarbaadi jaise logon kii sohabat mil gai
 Where he had to study science and become an engineer, where he started writing ghazals in the interest of these people
 'asraar' ke saath tabllus ke taur par 'shahid' jod liya
 Phani is said to have Islamized the early Ghazals of Majaz
 yah alag baat he ki majaaz ne unase islah to karaayaa ,parantu unki gazalon kaa prabhaav apane upar nahin padane diya
 In Agra, he learned the nuances of ghazalgoi and aruz
 is dauraan unamem darshaniktaa kaa put bhi aayaa, jiskaa unamem abhaav tha
 Later Mazaz continued to glow
