 rafique ne enditivi se baatcheet main kaha, state level par footbal main hamaare skool se saat ladakiyon kaa chayan hua tha, jisamen teen under 17 main khel kar ai thane main slam soker ke pratinidhiyon ne rohinee kaa khel dekha jo unhen bahut acha laga
 He was called to Nagpur for the trial
 vahaan bhi usne bahut acha pradarshan kiya jiske baad chile ke liye uskaa sillection ho gaya
 Even after selection, Rohini had a big problem
 65,000 rupayon kaa intazaam, lekin sthaneey str par madad ke liye kai haath aage aae or rohinee ke sapanom ko pankh mil gaye
 Rohini will represent Team India in the Homeless World Cup, one girl each has been selected from Nagpur and Pune
 2014 loksabhaa ke chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko jitaane ke liye bhaajapa ke logon ne tinkaa tinkaa jodakar jeet kaa kaaravaan aage badhaayaa tha
 In these speeches, the stalwarts of other parties were also included in the party by giving great assurances
 un logon ne puri nishtha ke saath bijepi kii vichaardhaara main apane ko dhaal kar mehnat bhi kii
 He was expected to get a ticket
 lekin jab tikat kii ghoshnaa hui to bahari kaa thappa laga kar unhen tikat kii majboot daavedaari se baahar kar diya gaya
 Among these, the Congress is the most stubborn supporter whose political career is at stake
 shahar dakshini se 2012 ke chunaav main lagbhag 45000 vot paakar duusare sthaan par rahe dayashankar mishra dayaaloo ko loksabhaa ke chunaav main bade aashwaasan ke saath party main shaamil karaayaa gaya tha
 For the last three years, he has been working hard on this assembly seat
 lekin tikat na milane se unke samarthak jahaan baagi ho rahe hai to vahiin dayashankar mishra stabdh or khamosh ho gaye hai
 Because he feels that his career is at stake
 isi tarah congress se aae dow
 Ashok Singh is haalanki ye banaras se nahin balki gajipur sadar se tikat maang rahe the
 Outsiders were also denied tickets
 ashok singh baatcheet main kehete hai, 'bhaajapa ke bade netaa ne vishvas dilaayaa tha ki is baar tikat milegaa
 But at the time cut
 ' aakhir kis maanak se kaata wo unki samaj se par he
 While Ashok Singh contested the election of Mayor from Congress in Benaras and he got 73 thousand votes

 So they are unable to understand on what basis their ticket was cut
 wo apane aapako puri tarah thaga mahasoos kar rahe hai
 His supporters are advising him to fight independents but he is still silent and waiting for his time
 tikat bantwaare kaa ye virodh sirf bahaar se bhaajapa main aae logon ke tikat na milane kaa hi nahin he balki bhaajapa main apane andar bhi jin logon ko tikat diya gaya unka bhi jamkar virodh ho rahaa he
 There is more dissatisfaction especially in the bjp's traditional seat city Dakshin and Cantt assembly seat
 is asantosh kaa pradarshan bhi pradhanmantri ke sansadeey karyaalay se lekar bhaajapa ke karyaalay or sangh ke daftar main bhi dikhaai padaa
 The comments tikat bantwaare ke baad se hi bijepi ke sthaneey bade padaadhikariyon ko is tarah ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Shyamdev Chaudhary, a 7-time MLA from City Southern, is also not happy with his ticket being cut and people who got tickets
 sutara kehete hai ki unhone dabi jabaan main ye tak kah diya ki janata sab dekh rahi he, wo khud hisaab kar legi
 Shyamdev Rai Chaudhary, popularly known as Dada's surname, is the BJP face in Benaras
 unhen is baat kaa gaharaa aghat laga he ki unase is babat kisi ne raay jaanane kii bhi jarurat nahin samajhi
 From the Cantt assembly constituency, the party relied on the Srivastava family
 yahaan vidhayak rahe harish chandra shrivastav, uske baad unki patni jyotsna shrivastav or ab unke bete saurabh shrivastav ko tikat mil gaya, jisase kaaryakarta bahut niraash hai
 Those who were hoping for a ticket are disappointed, but the BJP workers too have probably been so disappointed with this ticket distribution in Benaras for the first time
 yahi vajah he ki pehali baar banaras main virodh kaa swar itnaa mukhar hua
 When the Prime Minister's office protested, the effigy was also burnt
 bahari taur par is virodh ko aap bahut bada nahin kah sakate par andar virodh bahut tej sulag rahaa he
 And if the high command does not cool it down soon, then it is not a big deal that in this fire, BJP should not lose its traditional seat

 Harish Chandra Srivastava, who was an MLA here, then his wife Jyotsna Srivastava and now his son Saurabh Srivastava, got the ticket, leaving the workers very disappointed
 jo log tikat kii ummid lagaae baithe the wo to niraash hai hi, lekin bhaajapa kaa kaaryakarta bhi shaayad pehali baar banaras main is tikat bantwaare se itnaa noummid hua he
 This is the reason that for the first time in Banaras the tone of protest became so vocal
 pradhanmantri ke karyaalay par virodh hua to putala bhi foonka gaya
 On the outside, you cannot call this protest very big, but inside the protest is very fast
 or agar ise jald alaakaman thanda nahin kar paata to koi badi baat nahin ki is aag main bijepi kahin apni paramparaagat seat hi na ganvaa baithe

 US President Barack Obama is talking about an attack on Syria in the name of restoring democracy and protecting humanity in Syria

 But Syria is opposing America's fervor among the world warriors who are gearing up for the fight
 ye sahi he ki syria ke logon ne raashtrapati asad ke chemical hathiyaaron kaa dard or dansh bhoga he
 But those people do not want the US to repeat the story that Iraq suffered ten years ago

 This news came from Russia, but it was soon denied
 america ne kaha- hamane nahin daaga
 NATO said - We do not know
 lekin ye to sabko pataa he ki syria agle yuddh kaa maidan ban saktaa he
 For this, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, is calling for talks
 shanti kii rat sabane laga rakhi he, lekin yuddh kii taiyaari bhi ho chuki he
 Combat ships have camped in the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea near Syria

 The atmosphere is hot on both sides, Iran is standing in favor of Haseria, China and Russia are not against either
 duusari taraf america, france or isroyal jaise desh puri tarah syria par hamale ke pakshdhar hai
 Turkey and Jordan have support in Gulf countries
 in sabake bich england kaa naitik samarthan jari he
 Iran even threatened that if the US attacks Syria, it will attack Israel
 in sabake bich america ke nishane par syria ke kuch ahm thikaane hai
 Syrian Rashtrapati Bhavan, Ministry of National Security, Ministry of Defense, Special Forces Command, Republican Guard and Damascus Airport are the most important of the US marks
 rus or china america ko samajha rahe hai
 Therefore, the risk of war will increase when President Assad starts attacking with his missiles, which can also be loaded with chemical weapons
 syrian raashtrapati ne bhi dhamkee di he ki mere desh par kisi bhi hamale kaa anjaam bahut bura hoga
 War can break out here and once the ammo pile is broken the situation will go out of control

 Meanwhile, the US has deployed its weapons around Syria

 hamale kii koshish ke peeche asli sach 'tel kaa khel'america raashtrapati baraak obama syria ke khilaaf yuddh par amada dikh rahe hai
 The reason being cited is a cry for higher values of morality
 lekin syria main loktantr kii sthapana kii vajah ke peeche asli khel to tel kaa he
 Syria is in the grip of fierce civil war
 ghar ke is jhagade main jab rasinic hathiyaaron kaa istemaal shuru hua to maut syria kii sadakon par nanga naach karne lagi
 Such use of conventional weapons began on 21 August, in which more than 1400 people have been killed and more than 400 innocent children
 ab bhi yahaan sunni, alaawite or isaayiyon kaa aapasi sangharsh jari he, jiske chalate ab tak kareeb 20 lakh log duusare deshon kii taraf bhaag rahe hai
 On this basis, Obama is talking about attacking Syria for free, but according to experts, the truth behind the attack is something else
 petroleum bhandar ke maamle main syria duniya kaa 33waan sabase bada desh he
 It has 250 million barrels of oil
 america kii najar uske tel par he
 The world has seen what the United States has been doing in the Gulf War of 1991 and 2003 as well
 das saal baad vahi chaal syria main dohraane kii koshish ho rahi he, lekin khatra ye he ki kahin petrol main lagi aag se duniya naa jhulasane lage
 So India's condition will get worse, many countries including Russia are trying to ensure that there is no war in Syria
 phir bhi agar yuddh hua to khadi deshon main ladaai kii chingaari hi petroleum padaarthon kii keemton main aag laga degi
 In such a situation, India can also be affected
 jab rupaya ludhakta he, dollar chadhataa he, jab khadi deshon main koharaam machataa he, tab hindustan main dijal-petrol ke daam main aag lag jaati he
 Therefore, if there is a war in Syria, then India will also be threatened
 petrol kaa meter or teji se upar bhaagega
 Meanwhile, a balanced statement has come from the Ministry of External Affairs
 is sangharsh kaa koi sainik samaadhaan nahin ho saktaa
 We consistently support the International Conference on Syria (geneva-2) for a political solution to this problem in which the Syrian government and opponents can be brought to the negotiating table
 mana ja rahaa he ki jaruri padaa to rus or china syria ke liye faujee madad bhi bhej sakate hai, lekin isse khatra ye he ki kahin ladaai kaa dayera kaaphi bada naa ho jaae or duniya ke tamaam desh isamen naa aa jaaen
 Then wait until September 9, when the US Parliament is going to debate and vote on the action on Syria

 Every kind of discussion is being discussed about Dhoni's successor, the names of many players are coming up but Billings considers Pant to be at the forefront
 bhale hi unki team main sanju samson bhi hon jinhone ipel ke dasven sijan kaa pehla shatak lagaaya he
 Behind the wicket, Dhoni reminds Dhoni that "I have seen the most talented young player in my life, then Rishabh Pant
" pant har tarah se behtareen hai, phir chaahe baat ek ballebaaj ke taur par ho yaa phir wicketiper
 He reminds Dhoni of the way he stands behind the wicket and i hope that the day Dhoni retires from ODI, he will be replaced by Pant in Team India
 "world class bolers ke chhudaae chakkeengland ke is dhakad ballebaaj ne pant ko jab net par ballebaaji karte dekha to wo hairaan rah gaye
 He said, "last year, when i looked on the net, i was surprised that he was hitting a bowler like Nathan Coulter Nile and Chris Morris outside of Kotla, looking at him, i started thinking that Jesus, this boy is only 19 years old
 
 " Prime Minister Narendra Modi quoted Deendayal Upadhyay at the bjp's national convention held in Kozhikode, Kerala on September 23-25, saying, "do not reward Muslims, neither dispel but refine
" " apni chhavi se alag sidhe musalamaanon ko sambodhit karne ke modi ke andaaj ne bijepi netaaon ko bhi sakate main daal diya
 After all, in September 2011, the same Modi refused to wear a hat in Ahmedabad five years ago
 party ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''bhale modi ne sandarbh se hatakar baat kii, lekin unki kaaryastylee kii yahi visheshta he ki ve bina kisi thos ranneeti ke na to kuch bolte hai or na hi kuch karte hai
 "the same thing happened

 baaki rajnatik dalon ne musalamaanon main bijepi ke prati dar kii bhaavana paidaa kar apane saath rakhaa, lekin hamen unka vishwaas jitkar apnaanaa he
 Image versus compulsion: Actually, the major reason for the change in BJP and Modi's Muslim strategy is the lessons learned from the last two years of elections
 bijepi ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''2014 ke aam chunaav main musalamaanon kaa samarthan nahin milane ke baavjood bijepi satta main he
 But to play a long innings in politics, it is necessary to gain the trust of a Muslim society with a population of 200 million and this initiative should be two-way
 " lekin loksabhaa chunaav ke baad jis tarah bihar or dilli main bijepi ke virodh ke naam par lamabandi hui or party ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa, usne bijepi ke ranneetikaron ko sochane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 According to sources, the BJP is working only on the strategy that it may not get the vote of the Muslim community, but the mobilization that takes place in the name of BJP-RSS opposition, dumps the bjp's strategy
 party kii ranneeti usee gusse or nafrat kii bhaavana ko khatm karne kii he
 The Uttar Pradesh elections due next year are extremely sensitive and the BJP fears that the Samajwadi Party's internal split may turn the Muslims outright towards the BSP, which is worrying for the BJP
 muslim panchayat bhale uttar pradesh main nahin yojit kii ja rahi he, lekin party iske jariye sakaaratmak sandesh jarur dena chaahati he
 Apart from domestic politics, a senior BJP leader is also linking it to global strategy
 unka kahana he ki modi ne pichley do saal main afghanistan, yuai, saudi arab, iran jaise islamic deshon ke saath sambandh banane main safalataa hasil kii he
 But still at the event like Dadri, this atmosphere is created that the Muslims of India are fearful because of BJP being in power

 This panchayat especially keeps the work related to the welfare of Muslims by keeping a detailed account of schemes like the Prime Minister's New 15 Point Plan, Multisectoral Development Program (MSDP) schemes, learn and earn scheme, Ustad, Nai Manzil

 " unka daawa he ki pradhanmantri ne jin dinadayal upaadhyaay ko uddhrut kiya, unki ekatm maanavvaad ke siddhant main hi musalamaanon par bharosa nahin karne kii baat dikh rahi he
 But Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani, the Mohtamim (rector) of Darul Uloom Deoband, welcomes Prime Minister Modi's initiative but he also doubts it
 ve kehete hai, ''bijepi kii soch main tabdili kaa ehsaas dikh rahaa he
 The Sachar report is still buried in the files, so we will wait for what happens in the words and actions
 " isi tarah, barelvi sufi parampara ke khankah-e-niajia ke prabandhak shabbu miyaan niaji kehete hai, ''pradhanmantri kii soch acchhee he, lekin dekhnaa hoga ki ve kitna kaamyaab ho pate hai or party ke dabaav se kitna baahar nikalakar kaam kar pate hai
 "but BJP leader Sabir Ali is confident that the Prime Minister will succeed in his thinking
 ve kehete hai, ''musalamaanon ko yah samajhnaa hoga ki use aane vaali peedi ko acha bananaa he to khud ko ek rajnatik haath main girvee rakhane kii jarurat nahin he
 Muslims should also change and openly welcome bjp's initiative
 "vaicharik dwandv muhim main mushkilbijepi or sangh itihaas ke aadhaar par muslim ranneeti main safalataa kii ummid dekh rahaa he
 Says a BJP leader, "the perception about BJP and Muslims is still there, in the 1940s there was more alienation among the Muslims for the Congress
 lekin baad main congress ne use apane saath mila liya
 "but this is not the case with BJP
 gandhivadi samaajwaad ke udaar vichaar par bani party ko vot tabhi mili, jab vah ram mandir andolan ke jariye hindutv kii taraf mudi

 sangh se jude bijepi ke hi ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''hamaara vaicharik gathan hi is tarah kaa he ki usase musalamaanon kaa bharosa hasil kar paanaa mushkil he
 "indresh Kumar, a member of the Sangh's national executive and founder of the Muslim Rashtriya Manch, rejects the concept that the sangh-bjp wants to improve its image among Muslims
 ve kehete hai, ''ham musalamaanon ko sahi disha main laane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 a Muslim believes that for years, the so-called secular parties have not allowed the community to come into the mainstream and only consider it as a vote
 kattarwadiyon ne aatank ke liye istemaal kiya to secularavaadi partiyon ne sangh ke khilaaf bhadakaane kaa kaam kiya
 But now the Muslim is coming out of this and believes that he got nothing from abusing the RSS, but other parties misused it
 isliye musalamaanon main sudhaarwad, parivartan or vikaas kaa bada andolan janm le rahaa he
 "the BJP is confident that the Modi government's efforts will undermine the hatred of the saffron family among Muslims

 "BJP is also worried because its core voter has a specific mindset, which will only make it difficult for him to work in a Muslim perspective
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki is soch ke saath kya bijepi musalamaanon kaa dil jeet paaegi? The Mumbai Academy of Movement Image (MAMI) has taken a tough stand against the accused after the name surfaced under the metoo campaign

 ’bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, ‘main chahta hum ki sarkaar kisaanon ko suraksha pradaan karne vaali nitiyaan banaae
 Due to wrong agricultural policies of the central government, farmers are not getting the price of their crop
 mujhe is baat se aashcharya he ki aalu kii behtareen paidaavaar hone ke baavjood kisaan asamanjas kii sthiti main hai, kyonki vah apni laagat nikaal paane main asafal rahe hai
 Captain Abhimanyu said that the government needs to formulate an agricultural policy that protects the interests of small farmers
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki congress hameshaa se kisaanon ke bhavishya ke saath khilwaad karti rahi he
 Earlier, the BJP leader along with Manoranjan Kalia and other leaders, in-charge of the 'janavasti rally' to be held on December 24, reviewed the meeting and rally venue of the national officials
 sthaneey netaaon dwaara kii gayi abtak kii taiyaariyon par captain abhimanyu ne santosh jataayaa
 It is worth noting that BJP chief Nitin Gadkari, former Home Minister LK Advani, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj and other big leaders are expected to attend the public trust rally in Jalandhar
 upi main shanivaar ko sibiai ne kai jagah chhapemari kii
 This action is related to the illegal sand mining case
 hamirpur, noida, lakhanu or kanpur samet anya ilaakon main kii gai chhapemari main kya baraamad hua, abhi yah saaf nahin he lekin yah spasht ho gaya ki iees adhikari bi
 The wires of this action related to Chandrakala are seen to be associated with the former Chief Minister of the state Akhilesh Yadav because the case of illegal mining dates back to the time when the then CM Akhilesh Yadav also had the responsibility of the Minister of Mining
 udhar gathbandhan, idhar chhapeise ittefaq kahen yaa kuch or ki nai dilli main ek ore shanivaar ko subah sapa-basapa gathbandhan kii baithak chali or udhar dopaher hote-hote upi ke kai thikaanon par dhadadhad sibiai ke chaape pad gaye
 On the one hand, it was decided that SP and BSP will contest 37-37 seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in UP and on the other hand by CBI, Akhilesh Yadav MLA Ramesh Mishra and his brother Dinesh Kumar are accused in the illegal mining case
 ab sibiai sutron ke hawaale se khabaren aa rahi hai ki khanan maamle meghkhilesh yadavaki bhoomika kii bhi jaanch kii jaaegi or jaanch agency unase poochtacha bhi kar sakati he
 It is necessary to know here that Akhilesh Yadav was the Chief Minister of UP from the year 2012 to 2013 as well as the Minister of Mining
 aise main maamle kii aanch akhilesh yadav tak pahunch sakati he
 The case is old, but the raid is still going on in the different factions of the new media at the time of the raid but there is no question of action as the case has proceeded on the direction of the High Court
 elahabaad hoicourt ne 2016 main sapa sarkaar ke kaarykaal main avaidh khanan or manamaane taur par khadaanon ke patte dene kaa maamla sibiai ko saunp diya tha or is par jaanch aage badhaane ko kaha tha
 To go a little further in this matter, on 31 May 2012 there was a tender in UP which was not under e-tender
 lihaaja is maamle ko court ne kaaphi sangeen mana aurasibiaiko jaanch ke nirdesh die
 The raids against DM are arising that why action should be taken against any administrative officer in illegal mining case? Let me tell you that the syndicate of mining mafia and officers has been very popular in UP
 aksar aarope lagaae jate rahe hai ki khanan mafia apane rasookh kaa laabh uthaakar manamafik dm banavaate rahe hai or khadaan patte lete rahe hai
 There have been allegations of access to the mining mafia to the government so that they can decide DM in the mining areas of their own free will
 diembi chandraklapar hamirpur main jiladhikari rahete avaidh khanan or apane chaheton ko patte dene kaa arope he
 In this connection, two years ago, the High Court ordered the CBI to investigate
 or bhi kai kaaran hai jiske chalate chandrakala chaape kii jad main ain
 She was also in the news for not declaring her assets as an IAS officer
 saath hi 2011 ke baad mahaj do saal ke andar unki sampatti 10 guna tak bad gai
 Chandrakala was a DM in the government five times, including Hamirpur
 2017 main sibiai ne unase poochtacha kii thi
 At the same time, the then Principal Secretary (mining) Dr
 gurudeep singh se khanan maamle main poochtacha hui thi
 SP-BSP leader on target? B
 chandrakala ke alaava jin khaas logon ke khilaaf karrwai hui he unamem ek hambasapaake purv jila panchayat adhyaksh sanjay dikshit or duusare sapa ke emelsi ramesh mishra or unke bhai dinesh mishra
 Sanjay Dixit's mother, Maya Dixit, had a lease for maurang mining
 ye vahi patte hai, jahaan avaidh maurang khanan kii kai shikaayatein mili thim
 At present, the CBI is proceeding in this case and is taking action to gather evidence
 maaya, mulaayam ke baad akhileshbaspa supremeomayawatior sapa ke purv adhyakshamulaayam sinhayadav aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main funs chuke hai
 The CBI has also conducted an inquiry against these two leaders but the cases were closed due to lack of evidence
 mulaayam singh par aay se adhik sampatti kaa maamla november, 2005 main tab saamne aayaa jab raibareli ke rahane vaale vakil or congress kaaryakarta vishwanath chaturvedi ne supreme court main ek janhit yachika daayar kar mulaayam, unke beton akhilesh yadav or pratik yadav or bahu dimple yadav kii sampatti kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii maang kii thi
 However, the investigating agency could not gather evidence against Mulayam Singh in this case, due to which it was decided to close the case
 ek aise hi maamle main sibiai ne aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle mensupreme courtke adeshon par kanoonee raay lene ke baad mayawati ke khilaaf apni jaanch band karne kaa faisla kiya
 Mayawati may have got immediate relief in one case but she is not yet given full relief as the CBI has started an investigation against her
 maamla unke shashan kaal ke dauraan 2010-11 main bechi gai 21 chini milon se judaa he
 The loss of Rs 1,179 crore is being reported to the state government due to the sale of these sugar mills
 ek aisa hi maamla 14 arab ke smarak ghotaale kaa saamne aayaa tha jisamen basapa supremeo kaa naam uchhla tha
 However, the Allahabad High Court had rejected the plea for a probe by the CBI or SIT
 ye sabhi maamle abhi alag-thalag pade hai
 So Mayawati and Mulayam Singh are still somewhat far away from the CBI investigation, but if they are questioned in the mining case, their name may be listed afresh in the CBI list

 Surrounding atal-advani with the former non-bjp governments, Modi credited this work to Atal ji and Advani, saying that i believe that due to legal reasons, the work was stopped for a few years, but the earlier government would have wished, it tried its heart Had it been done, this memorial would have been built many years ago, but the earlier government allowed dust to settle on the stone installed by Advani

 As a strategy, we need to understand what mistakes we made in the first match

 ) jimmy shergill apni acting or alag cinemai kirdaar ke liye mashhoor rahe hai
 Whether he talks about a very desi and young character in his 'haast' or his character like 'saheb Bibi Aur Gangster', his work has been excellent
 jimmy shergill ko nirdeshak tigmanshu dhulia, rajkumaar santoshi yaa phir anand el roy apni filmon ke ahm kirdaar main rakhte he
 Similarly, director Amitabh Singh's film 'shortcut Safari' is also ready for which Jimmy Shergill immediately agreed, knowing that the film is to be shot in very dense forests and there is a lot of experimentation in his character
 film 'shortkat safari' main unke kirdaar or bacchon kii film ke bare main jimmy shergill ne khulkar baat kii
 How did the film 'shortcut Safari' start? i was introduced to the director Amitabh Singh ji by Shoojit Sarkar many years ago and then Amitabh got a better understanding during the shooting of the film 'here'
 vah bahut hi umdaa technitian hai saath hi behad hi achche insaan bhi
 The camera work of the film 'here' was praised, then we also worked together in Ed films
 isliye jab vah mere paas film 'shortkat safari'ke liye aae or bataaya kii yah ek bacchon kii film he to phir maine turant haa kah diya kyonki main hameshaa se bacchon ke cinema ke prati khud ko bahut samarpit maanata hum
 What is your character in the film? My character in the film is very interesting
 yah kirdaar ek leopard jaisaa he jo ek green lambaa sa chola pahentaa he
 When the film encounters 7 children lost in the jungle, the story gets a twist
 phir yah jagal kaa bahut khaas jaanavar un bacchon ke liye sahaayak sabit hota he yaa phir unki jindagi ko or mushkil main daalata he yah aapako film dekhakar hi pataa chalegaa
 Tell me something about the film? The story of this film is the story of seven children on a school picnic who go missing in the jungle
 neshnal park yaa bade garden ke mukaable bachche jangal kii asli duniya ko pehali baar kareeb se dekhte hai
 There is a real encounter with the Children's Jungle
 film ke shooting ke dauraan jangal kaa anubhav kaisaa rahaa?film 'shortkat safari' kii shooting gujarat ke jangalon main hui he
 Satpura is near Dang Forest
 main bahut aashcharyachakit hua kyonki maine itnaa ghanaa jangal kabhi nahin dekha tha
 The largest spider in the country is found at the place where we were shooting
 meraa castum kaaphi alag tha
 i was very careful because there was a very dense forest
 jangal ke bade jaanwaron ke saath hi chote keede se bhi coffee khatra rahata tha lekin hamanen shooting bina kisi durghatana ke puri kii
 Is it a risk to make films on children or not? i wish i knew
 bahut kam log hai jo is tarah kaa saahas karte he
 Challenging films with children is challenging
 'stanley kaa dabba', 'taare jameen par', 'makadi' sab mushkil filmein thi
 Working with a professional artist and child is a different experience? First of all we have to pay attention to our character
 is film main bacchon se jab minfilm kii shootingke liye gujarat main mila to lagbhag hafte bhar kii shooting puri ho gai thi
 The children got very mixed with their characters and the forest
 bacchon se bahut kuch seekhney ko miltaa he bada dilachasp rahata he
 Will i do other films with children as well? i am always ready for children's films provided the filmmakers want to do something for the children
 yah bahut hi sochane vaali baat he ki log bacchon kii film lekar itane darate kyon hai
 Any memories related to school trips or childhood movies? There were no major incidents in our school trips
 ham log kabhi saath jate the to koi kuch khaane ke liye baahar chalaa jaataa tha yaa phir koi aas paas hi gum ho jaataa tha lekin kuch aisa bahut badi ghatana nahin hui 
 At that time there were only theaters for films, parents were not together
 hamaara ravivaar ko film dekhnaa tay hota tha jisamen chachere bhai bahan or frends kaa group hota tha
 Tell me about the upcoming films? The film 'buddha in Traffic' in which i am working with Manoj Bajpayee
 film ke yuva nirdeshak rajesh pillai kaa dehanth ho gaya
 Now the producers are preparing for the film's release
 duusari film 'madari' he jiske nirdeshak nishikant kaamat hai
 The film also stars Irrfan Khan
 iske saath meri punjabi film 'baisakhi list' relies ho rahi he jo out and out kamedi film he
 Just like Independence Day List, Republic Day List and good prisoners are released on the basis of nature, similarly we have 'baisakhi List' in Punjab
 film main meraa kirdaar bhi ek kaidi kaa he
 Both 'sahib Bibi Aur Gangster' and 'tanu Weds Manu' films have been special for your career, you have followed a particular trend about your characters, have you always chosen interesting topics and characters, i am someone Does not follow the trend
 bahut acha lagata he ki mere dwaara nibhaaen gaye kirdaaron ko darshakon ne pasand kiya

 What would you like to say about award functions? It is a great pleasure when others get awarded, although in my life, awards do not matter that much, but it is great to meet friends in this function

 kyonki ham yahaan kitne saalon se kaam kar rahe hai
 Young Generation should be awarded
 main aauungaa, baithunga or parform karata rahoonga
 Do you think some better films were released in 2015? i feel that better films like 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' should have been released and it would have been very good for all of us
 lekin aisa hua nahin
 How is the shooting of 'sultan' film going? It is going very well, very difficult film
 kya aap suraj badjatya ke saath agali film kar rahe hai?jab tak suraj mere saath kaam karnaa chahenge, main jarur karuunga
 Did you see Sonam Kapoor's 'nirja'? No, i could not see, but during 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' she showed me some glimpses of this film and is a very hard working actress
 mujhe pataa tha ki film ko darshak jarur pasand karenge
 Aamir Khan was praising your film 'sultan'
 ji main 'dangal' ke liye zyada utsahit hum

 a post shared by Voompla (@voompla) on Apr 27, 2018 at 9:59 pm PDT dhoni or prasad kii mulaakaat main kuch bhi ajeeb nahin tha, kyonki yah ranjai kaa ahm match tha or mukhya chayankarta hone ke naate prasad ko gharelu tallent kii khoj ke liye ise dekhnaa ek tarah se jaruri bhi tha, jabaki emes dhoni ke rajya kii team pehali baar semifinal main pahunchi thi or vah uske menter hai
 Dhoni reached there to encourage the team
 phir na jane aisa kya hua ki match khatm hone ke kuch hi ghanton baad dhoni ke captaini chhodane kii khabar aa gai
 According to the Indian Express newspaper, Dhoni met the chief selector Prasad late in the evening and uttered three words, 'ok that's it'
 iske saath hi team india kii vanade or tii-20 captaini ke saare sameekaran badalakar viraat kohli kii ore ho gaye, jo in dinon test main apni captaini se dhooma machaa rahe hai or iske vaastavik daavedaar hai
 The comments ab jabaki na to chayankartaaon or na hi board ke kisi adhikari ne emes dhoni ke captaini chhodane ko lekar dabaav ke bare main kuch kaha he, aise main mana ja rahaa he ki dhoni ne khud simit overon ke cricket main team india ke bhavishya ko dekhte hue yah faisla le liya he
 As it was said that Virat Kohli is now ready for the ODI and T20 captaincy after the Test as well
 sambhawatah dhoni ne bhi kuch aisa hi mahasoos kiya ho or ab keval apane khel par dhyaan dena chaahate hon
 Anyway, amidst the rise of Virat Kohli, there was a lot of pressure on Dhoni and the performance of Team India in odis - T20 too has not been very special for some time
 vanade world cap main bhi ab lagbhag do saal kaa hi samay bachaa he or team india ko isse pehle mahaj 55 vanade hi khilne hai, vahiin champions trophy bhi najadik he
 In such a situation, it was mandatory for the selectors to take a decision related to it, given the preparation and team composition
 indian express kii akhbaar kii khabar ke anusaar, dhoni ne mukhya chayankarta prasad se der shaam mulaakaat kii or unase teen shabd kahe, 'oke dats it'
 With this, all the equations of Team India's ODI and T20 captaincy have changed to Virat Kohli, who is making his captaincy in the Test these days and is its real contender
 tippaniyan Now that neither the selectors nor any of the board officials have said anything about the pressure on MS Dhoni to leave the captaincy, it is believed that Dhoni himself is looking at the future of Team India in limited overs cricket
 This decision has been taken
 jaisaa ki kaha ja rahaa tha ki viraat kohli ab test ke baad vanade or tii-20 kii captaini ke liye bhi taiyaar hai
 Dhoni may have felt the same way and now only wants to focus on his game
 vaise bhi viraat kohli ke ubhaar ke bich dhoni par kuch zyada hi dabaav tha or vanade- tii20 main team india kaa pradarshan bhi pichley kuch samay se khaas nahin rahaa he
 In the ODI World Cup too, there is only about two years left and Team India has to play only 55 odis before this, while the Champions Trophy is also close
 aise main taiyaari or team sangyojan ko dekhte hue chayankartaaon ke liye bhi isse judaa koi faisla lenaa anivaary tha
 Now that neither the selectors nor any of the board officials have said anything about the pressure on MS Dhoni to leave the captaincy, it is believed that Dhoni himself is looking at the future of Team India in limited overs cricket
 This decision has been taken
 jaisaa ki kaha ja rahaa tha ki viraat kohli ab test ke baad vanade or tii-20 kii captaini ke liye bhi taiyaar hai

 "seeking votes in favor of the Congress candidate, Sidhu even went on to say that no one in the world can defeat the Congress but only the Congress defeats themselves
" aise main kaaryakartaaon ko ekajute hokar chunaav ladanaa hoga siddhu ne elaan kar diya ki 2019 main rahul gandhi laal kile par jhanda fahraayenge

 Let us tell you that the Kamal Nath government has temporarily stopped the pension of MISA prisoners in Madhya Pradesh
 29 disambar, 2018 ko jari shasnadesh main kaha gaya he ki jinhen pension milti he uski jaanch ke baad ise phir se shuru kiya jayega
 The General Administration Department has attributed this to physical verification of pensioners and making the process of pension distribution more transparent
 or iske liye sieji kii report ko aadhaar banaaya gaya
 Under the Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan Samman Nidhi rule in the former BJP government of Madhya Pradesh, more than 2000 MISABANDI are taking a monthly pension of 25 thousand rupees
 saal 2008 main shivaraj sarkaar ne misa bandiyon ko 3000 or 6000 pension dene kaa praavdhaan kiya
 Later the pension amount was increased to Rs 10,000
 saal 2017 main misa bandiyon kii pension raashi badhaakar 25000 rupee kii gai
 The third T20 match between India and New Zealand will be played today, which will be the deciding match of the series
 duusare tii-20 main bharat kii haar ke baad purv captain mahendra singh dhoni kii team main jagah par sawaal uthe
 Many former cricketers said that now that Dhoni is not replaced in the T20 team, he should now give the youngsters a chance
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki agar dhoni tii-20 team kaa hissaa nahin hote hai, to phir unki jagah koun le saktaa he
 Will any of these five players become Dhoni's successor
 
 
 1
 After Wriddhiman Sahamhendra Singh Dhoni said goodbye to Test cricket, Saha took charge of wicketkeeping
 saaha achche wicketiper bhi hai, saath hi unhen nichle kram main ballebaaji kaa anubhav bhi he
 Saha has also done well in the IPL, he has shown his batting skills for Punjab
 2
 Dinesh Karthik, Dinesh Karthik has recently returned to the ODI team
 vaapasi ke baad unhone acha pradarshan bhi kiya he
 He can be put to good use in place of Dhoni as Karthik also has experience
 jo ki middle order main acchhee tarah se istemaal ho saktaa he
 Karthik has also performed well in the Ranji Trophy and other matches
 3
 Rishabh Pantdilli's young batsman Rishabh Pant has won the hearts of all with his performance in the recent past
 unhone abhi do hi antarrashtriya tii-20 match khelen hai
 But Pant's IPL record has been quite good
 pant teji se ballebaaji karne main bhi sakasham he
 But it remains to be seen whether Pant will be able to fill Dhoni's place
 dhoni kii kya T-20 team main nahin he jagah? lakshmana ne bhi uthaae sawaal4
 KL rahulkl Rahul has done very well in Test matches in recent times
 lekin vanade or tii-20 team main vah jagah paane ke liye stregal karte rahe hai
 Rahul can keep keeping with the bat as well, perhaps he could benefit from this
 5
 Sanju Samson: Young Sanju Samson came into the public eye with a brilliant performance in Rajasthan Royals and then Mumbai Indians in IPL
 unhone abhi tak ek hi tii-20 khelaa he jisamen unhone 19 ran banaae hai
 Players like Indian veteran Rahul Dravid have also been praised for Sanju Samson's technique
 yuva samson ke liye yah ek acha mauka ho saktaa he

 Stung by the remarks of 'jungle Raj 2' in Bihar during a meeting of bjp's national executive in Bengaluru on Friday, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday questioned the BJP, 'what was the 2002 Gujarat riot?' bijepi adhyaksh shah ne shuukravaar ko bengalooru main bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main kaha tha ki bihar main 'jangal raaj 2' laut aayaa he
 Annoyed by this scathing remark, Nitish hit back at the BJP and asked reporters to answer what was the 2002 riots in Godhra
 patna main path nirmaan vibhaag ke shanivaar ko ek kaarykram main bhaag lekar nikle nitish ne kaha ki unhen anya sthanon par kanoon vyavastha ke bare main baat karne kaa kya naitik adhikaar he
 Nitish, who took over as chief minister for the fourth time on February 22, after his successor Jitan Ram Manjhi became a rebel, said that the rule of law was established in the state
 shah ke bijepi ke das saal se adhik samay tak satta main rahane ke daawey ke bare main nitish ne kaha ki unki hawa nikal gai he or satta main ek saal puraa hone se pehle hi unhen logon kaa gussa jhelana pad rahaa he
 He accused the BJP of being adept at making 'jumbalebaji': 'big claims' and said that it would have been better if the name of this party was 'bharatiya Jumblebaz Party'
 shah ne bengalooru main bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak ke dauraan shuukravaar ko aarope lagaaya ki endie se jediu ke alag hone ke baad bihar main 'jangal raaj 2' laut aayaa he or vishwaas ke saath kaha ki rajya kii janata is saal baad main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke paksh main janadesh degi
 Significantly, the current Nitish government is running with the support of Lalu Prasad's party RJD, whose reign from 1990 to 2005 was dubbed 'jungle Raj' by the opposition due to poor law and order
 beete ravivaar ko mirpur main bharat or srilanka ke bich tii20 world cap kaa final hua
 Which Sri Lanka won by 6 wickets
 is match ke tamaam pahaluon par kaaphi baat hui
 But one view was stuck in the eyes of everyone

 Then Sangakkara held Kohli's hand and talked to him for a long time
 isaki tasviren bhi ain
 But what happened, Sangakkara told a Colombo radio station
 sangakaara ne kaha ki kohli asaadhran rup se achche player hai
 Commenting on Kohli's body language, the former Sri Lankan captain said that yes, he is very excited and active on the field, but this is his method
 sangakaara ne kaha ki donon hi timen ek duusare kii bahut izzat karti hai or usee kadi main kohli sammaan prakat karne aae the
 It shows the sports spirit of the Indian team
 kohli kii chunauti par baat karte hue sangakaara bole ki vah jis dhang se khel rahe the, hamaare bolers chaukanne the
 He said that Sri Lanka was also helped by the fact that in the last overs, Kohli remained mostly stuck at the other end
 or is dauraan unke chehre par niraashaa bhi saaf najar aane lagi thi
 At the end of the interview, Sangakkara again praised Kohli and congratulated him

 canada ke pashchimi tat par ek samudr ke kinare stevestone main ek aisi ghatana hui kii sab use dekhakar sadame main aa gayi
 This has been seen very rarely before
 california ke dock par ek ladki ko machhlee pani main khinch kar le jaati he
 a man then jumps into the water to save her
 ye thi ghatnajab machhlee dock ke paas aati he or uchhalati he to vahaan khadey log wo dekhakar khush hote he
 The applause also plays
 uske baad ek ladki dock par baithti he
 The fish bounces only after a second of its sitting
 uske baad jo hua wo hairaan karne vaala tha
 The fish quickly catches the girl's dress and drags her into the water
 jiske baad vahaan khadey log ye dekhakar dar ke kaaran chillane lagate he
 Soon after, a person jumps into the water to save the girl
 is ghatana main na to us ladki kuch hua or na hi use bachaane vaale us aadmi ko
 The video took place and Royalmike Fujiwara made the video and was posted to youtube on Saturday
 ravivaar dopaher tak ye video viral ho gaya

 Not seen such an incident, Fujiwara said that he goes to the deli near the dock
 lekin unhone aisa kabhi nahin dekha jaisaa vahaan dekha
 Please tell that it is not yet clear whether the man who jumped in the water to save the girl knew that girl or not
 usne bataaya ki aisa ho saktaa he ki machhlee ne ladki kii dress ko khaanaa sochaa ho isliye use khinch liya ho
 In fact, such animals are not inherently dangerous

 Today is the birthday of the famous Nagamanigar Qatil Shifai
 vah 24 disambar, 1919 ko haripur hazaaraa main janmen the
 His real name was Aurangzeb Khan
 qatil unka tabllus tha, qatil yani wo jiskaa qatl ho chukaa he
 He studied up to high school in Rawalpindi, but missed school due to his father's untimely death
 kamdhaam ke silsile main rawalpindi pahunche or ghar chalaane, pet paalane ke liye tarah-tarah kaa kaam karne lage
 But his Muqaddar wrote something else for him
 sangharsh ke daur main unka likhnaa-padhanaa jari rahaa
 Read what Urdu and the poets of our times
 likhte bhi vahi shaayari
 In the same affair, Hazrat Shifa was made a master and befriended Trilokchand Mahroom, Jagannath Azad, Abdul Aziz Fursat and Abdul Hameed Adam
 iskaa phayda bhi hua
 Prabhakar Shrotriya, a poem whose life changed in 1947, when the country was divided and riots spread, he left Rawalpindi and moved to Lahore
 vahaan unhone shaayari main hi haath aajmaana chaha, par pakistan main bantwaare ke pehle saal to koi film bani nahin
 He started getting frustrated, but hard work paid off
 1948 main jab pehali film 'teri yaad' bani, to tanwir naqvi or safuddin saif ke saath qatil shifaai ko bhi geet likhane kaa mauka mila
 His song came out, and the meeting in Lahore's literary group increased
 yaheen vah sahir ludhiaanvi, e
 Hameed and Ahmed became friends with Rahi
 sabab bana filmi risaala 'adaakaar', jiske sampadan se shifaai jud chuke the
 He benefited from editing film magazines and writing songs in films
 maukey milane lage, mali haalat majboot hui or shoharat bhi mili
 In the 1955 film 'qatil', Iqbal Bano sang 'ulfat ki Nai Manzil Ka Chala', Yun Dal's arms in arms
 
 
 
 In the 1957 film 'ishq-e-laila', 'paresh Raat Saari Hai, Sithaar Tum To So Jao' by katil-iqbal Bano and composer Safdar Hussain became very popular
 is geet ko baad baad main hindustani gazal gayak jagajeet singh or chitra singh ne bhi apni aawaaj di
 In 1980, when Jagjit Singh and Chitra Singh recorded their album 'A Milestone', the ghazals of Qatil Shifai were sent to their homes with their voices
 isamen 'apane haathon kii lakiron main basaa le mujhako, main hum tera, tu naseeb apana bana le mujhako'; 'pareshaan raat sari he sitaron tum to so jaao'; 'mil kar juda hue to naa soya karenge ham, ek duusare kii yaad main royaa karenge ham'; 'ye mauzza bhi muhabbat kabhi dikhaae mujhe, ki sang tujh pe gire or zakhm aae mujhe'; 'tumhaari anjuman se uth ke diwane kahaan jate, jo vabsta hue tumse wo afsaane kahaan jate'; 'pehle to apane dil kii raza jaan jaaie, phir jo nigahe yaar kahe maan jaaie' jaisi gazalen shaamil hai
 Hence, Jnanpith-winning English writer Amitabh and Prizeahindustani Films have supplemented each other, and Katil wrote songs for the films 'painter Babu', 'phir Teri Kahani Yaad Ayi', 'sir', 'naaraj', 'nazayiz' etc
 inamen se kai film chaahe na chali hon, par unke likhe nagamen, 'tere dar par sanam chale aae, tu naa aayaa to ham chale aae'; 'aaj hamane dil kaa har kissa tamaam kar diya'; 'kab talak shamaa jali yaad nahin' 'dil detaa hai ro ro duhai, kisi se koi pyaar naa kare' or 'jab yaad kii badali chaati he' kaaphi mashhoor hue
 His success was that he wrote a song 'zindagi mein pyar kar karte hai, main tokki mari meri tujhe chahte hain', which he wrote for the Pakistani film 'azmat', released in 1973, later by Mehndi Hasan Sung with such a heart that people started believing it as theirs
 isi tarah ghulaam ali kii awaz main 'meri nazar se na ho dur ek pal ke liye, tera vazood he laazim meri ghazal ke liye,' itani mashhoor hui kaa kya kahana
 How many people sang their ghazals, how many times, how many times, it is difficult to write
 unheen main se ek he 'jab bhi aata he meraa naam tere naam ke saath, jane kyon log mere naam se jal jate hai
 'the killers are the poets of pain and love
 vah 17 saal ke the jab shaadi ho gai, par aashiqui taumr bani rahi
 Heart breaks and ghazals
 ek daur main unka ishq heroin chandrakanta se chalaa
 Rashmi was in Mumbai
 mashhoor gayika iqbaal bano se to ishkemzaji kaa alam shaadi kii khabaron tak ja pahunchaa
 Killer Shifai did not deny it
 haalanki unka nikaah nahin hua, par donon us muhane tak ja hi pahunche the
 Sahir was very friendly between Ludhiana and Qatil
 sahir ne qatil kii ek ghazal kaa matla 'jab bhi chahen ek nai surat bana lete hai log, ek chehre par kai chehre sajaa lete hai log' ko film 'daag' main thodaa badalakar istemaal kiya tha
 Memories - Pankaj Singh, a meeting that did not happen Qatil Shifai died on 11 July 2001, but before that he had left a mark in journalism besides being a famous poet and lyricist
 vah lahore ke masik adbe-latif, saptahik adaakaar, saptahik ujaalaa or peshawar ke masik sange-mile ke sampadakeey vibhaag se jude rahe
 Apart from this, he also became the secretary of Pakistan Writers Guild twice
 unki charchit kitabon main hariyaali, gajar, jalatarang, rogen, jhumar, mutariba, chhatnar, guftagu, pairahan, amokhta, ababil, bargad, bargad, ghungroo or samandar main seedhi shaamil tha
 
 
 Literature Aaj Tak tribute to this Azeem poet! manjit thakur / ieenessis pashchim bengal main loksabhaa chunaav main 18 siten jitkar bhartiya janata party ne raajnneetik vishleshkon ko chaunkaa diya tha, vahiin uske dhur virdohi dal trinmul congress ko up-chunaav main teen siton par bhaajapa ke haarane par behad santosh hua he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost in a three-seat by-election in West Bengal
 gauratlab he ki kendriya mantri devashree choudhary or pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh dilip ghosh ke kshetra main bhi party ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 However, BJP says that the party lost all the three seats in terms of results, but the party has finished second in terms of increase in votes compared to last time
 is tarah bhaajapa ab sattadhari trinmul congress kaa majboot vikalp ban chuki he
 Despite losing the by-elections in Kaliaganj and Kharagpur during the Lok Sabha elections, the defeat in the by-elections is troubling BJP leaders
 kaaliyaganj vidhansabha seat par kaante kii ladaai ke baad maatr 2,300 voton se bhaajapa kii haar hui
 Here in the 2016 assembly elections, BJP was third with just 27 thousand votes, but this time the by-election has got more than three times (more than 95 thousand) votes
 isi tarah karimpur vidhansabha seat par bhi bhaajapa apane voton main baari badhotaree karne main safal rahi he
 The votes have increased three times as compared to the previous assembly elections
 varsh 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko 23302 vot mili the, jabaki teen saal baad hue is upachunaav main 78 hajaar se zyada vot mili
 Sources in the West Bengal BJP say that the opposition votes are to be united behind the defeat in all three seats
 loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko 18 siten milane ke baad vipakshi vot ekajute ho gaye, jisase vot badhane ke baad bhi bhaajapa seat nahin jeet saki
 For example, in Karimpur seat, Trinamool Congress got 10,000 more votes than last time, while BJP also lost 55,000 more votes than last time
 is seat par marxbavaadi communist party (makapa) ke vot bhi trinmul ke paale main chale jane kii baat saamne aa rahi
 In such a situation, BJP sources are making allegations like nexus and friendly relations between CPI-M and Trinamool
 bhaajapa kii pashchim bengal ikai ke sachiv ritesh tiwari ne ieenes se kaha, "aksar upachunaav sattapaksh kii jeet hoti he, kyonki puri mashinari vipaksh ke khilaaf khadi rahati he
 The ruling Trinamool Congress won the Kaliaganj seat by just two thousand votes
 isse pataa chalata he ki rajya main vidhansabha chunaav main bhi janata bhaajapa kii taraf aashaa bhari nigahon se dekh rahi he
 “kaliaganj seat falls in Raiganj Lok Sabha constituency
 is sansadeey seat main janankikeey drushti se dekha jaae to muslim samudaay kii aabaadi bahumat main he phir bhi loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa kii debashri choudhary jeet hasil karne main kaamyaab rahi thim
 Party sources reveal that the Muslim vote was split between the CPI-M and the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections
 magar is baar vidhansabha chunaav main kaliyaganj seat par trinmul ke jeetne ke peeche muslim va bhaajapa virdohi voton kaa ekajute hona bataaya ja rahaa he
 In the 2016 assembly elections, BJP was won by Dilip Ghosh on the Kharagpur seat, which is considered a Congress stronghold
 magar is baar upachunaav main 20 hajaar se adhik voton se bhaajapa kii haar hui he
 Whereas in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had a lead of about 45 thousand votes in this assembly constituency
 vahiin kaaliyaganj seat par bhi bhaajapa ne 55 hajaar se zyada kii badhat banaai thi
 Bypolls were held in 2016 when Dilip Ghosh, who won from Kharagpur assembly seat on a BJP ticket and Trinamool MLA Mahua Mitra from Karimpur, became MP in 2019
 vahiin, congress vidhayak pramathanath raay ke nidhan ke kaaran kaaliyaganj seat par upachunaav karana padaa

 5 Stardirector: Manish Sharma Artist: Shah Rukh Khan Shah Rukh Khan has been under criticism for a long time because of his choice of characters
 isi jugat main ve bataur ek kalakaar apana loha dobaaraa se siddh karne main lage hai
 Anyway, the previous films were his multistar cast
 is baar shahrukh ne kuch hatakar karne kaa faisla kiya tha or film main sirfashahrukh khanhi najar aae
 Villain also Shahrukh, Hero also Shahrukh, Fan also Shahrukh and Superstar Shahrukh
 lekin film dekhakar jo baat man main ai vah yahi thi ki film samaj to ai lekin dil main nahin ai
 Manish Sharma chose the subject well, the first half was also fun but he could not do the buildup as is done for such a thriller
 phir jo dar najar aana chahie tha yaa jo dehshat shahrukh kii pehali filmon main dikhi thi chaahe vah 'baazeegar' ho yaa phir 'dar' vah isamen puri tarah nadaarad he
 Overall, it remains an average film, in which nothing unexpected happens and everything is very natural
 lekin film thriller kahana bilkul hi galat hoga
 How much Damdilli's son in the story is Gaurav (shahrukh Khan) who runs a cyber shop
 vah aryan khanna (shahrukh khan) kaa bahut bada fain he
 Has completely taken it away in itself and has completely descended into it
 vah is superstar ko jeeta he
 But when his passion turns into madness, he not only creates problems for the superstars, but also hurts the lives of both
 diarector ne kahani ko pehle half main bahut acha rakhaa he
 As far as pride is concerned, it works to connect his life
 lekin interwel ke baad aakar jab ection shuru hota he to film us tarah kaa majaa nahin dilaa paati he jis tarah kii isse ummid thi
 There is always a feeling that something will happen but by the end all the guesses are right, in which thriller is no fun
 star apilafilm main har jagah shahrukh hi shahrukh hai
 In Shah Rukh's previous films where he was seen in a crowd of many, this time he seems to be filling this gap
 gaurav ho yaa phir aryan har jagah shahrukh khan hi he
 In Gaurav's character, his style of speaking in Delhi is not only amazing, his acting is also amazing
 lekin ek baat mjedaar yah ki fain kaa gaurav kaaphi had tak 'tanu vaids manu riterns' kii 'datto' jaisaa bhi lagata he
 This thing is a bit strange
 film main baaki koi sitara he nahin, heroin he nahin or gaanaa he nahin, yah acchhee baat he
 Shahrukh looks good in every character
 kamai kii batshahrukh khan kii film ho to jaahir-si baat he ki film kaa bajet kam nahin hoga
 If the sources are to be believed then the budget of the film is about 80 crores
 se upar bataaya jaataa he
 If this figure is correct then the film will have to be a tremendous hit to be a hit
 film ke pehle din pehle sho main acha rispons tha
 Shahrukh Khan's 'fan' had come in good numbers, but when he came out, he had the words on his tongue that the first half was fun
 aajafinerelis hui he or dilli main od evan bhi lagu hua he
 In this way, the number of cine lovers in the car will reach half
 baaki yah film puri tarah se shahrukh khan ke phans ke liye he
 Chhattisgarh High Court Bilaspur has expressed concern over tiger poaching in the state's forests
 usne rajya sarkaar ko baaghon kii ghatati sankhya par notice jari kiya he
 The High Court has asked the government to give an answer within three weeks on why the tiger population in the state is declining
 yachikakarta nitin singhvi ke mutabik pradesh main baaghon ke sangrakshan ke liye sarkaar kii ore se jo prayaas ho rahe he, usame ghor laaparvaahee barti ja rahi he
 The forest department claims that three tigers died in the state and 28 tigers in the Achanakmar Tiger Reserve are not correct
 rajya sarkaar ne beeti sunwaayee main bataaya tha ki van vibhaag main 50 pratishat van aarakshakon kii kami he
 The recruitment process is going on to remove this shortcoming, but the government has not responded to this
 beete do saalo main rajya ke kai ilaakon se baaghon ke shikaar kii khabare surkiyon main rahi
 There is also evidence of the presence of officials active in the forests, especially during the hot season
 aisa nahin he ki van vibhaag kaa maujuuda seoup vanya praaniyon kii raksha ke liye daksh nahin he, lekin kabhi bhi usne unke sangrakshan ke liye dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 In the official records, paper evidence of wildlife conservation was recorded, but the officers did not turn to the forests, as a result, the tiger was killed
 lihaajib hoicourt nerajya sarkaar ko teen saptaah ke bheetar baaghon kii likhit jaankaree prastut karne ke nirdesh die he
 Naxalites who surrendered in Chhattisgarh should not take the path of Naxalism again, for this they are being taught jobs related to employment
 sarkaar ko ummid he ki yadi unhen aajeevika kaa saadhan muhaiyaa kara diya jaae to ve aapraadhik rasta par kabhi nahi jaaenge
 In Bastar, 600 surrendered men and women are now learning the skills of earning a livelihood by giving up the Naxalite gun
 lekin agar samay rahete inhen roji-roti muhaiyaa nahi karai gai to phir se ye naksalwad ke raste par laut sakate hai
 Therefore, a lot of efforts are being made to ride the lives of such wandering youth
 bastar main aatmasamarpan ke baad purushon or mahilaon kii raah badal gai he
 Earlier they used to have guns in their hands
 lekin ab inke haathon main ab rojgaar kii bagdor aane vaali he
 Many of them are learning to become electricians and carpenters, many masons
 inkaa bhavishya ab inaki yogyata or ruchi ke aadhaar par tay hogi
 For which these surrendered Naxalites are sweating
 darasal bastar ke jangal ke bheetar ke gaanv main based jyadataar naujavaanon kii takalif yahi he ki unhen naa to kabhi skool-college main daakhile kaa avasar mila or naa hi kabhi unki ruchi padhai-likhaai main rahi he
 As a result, these youth were misled by Naxalites
 phir inase naksali jo kehete chale gaye ye log bhi vahi kaam karte rahe
 Well, the moment passed now is not going to come in the life of Dobarain
 lekin ab ve ek nai jindagi kii shuruuaat jarur kar sakate hai
 The surrendered Naxalites used to do many things while staying in their dalam
 kai apane dalam main shaamil saathiyon ke khaane-pine kaa bandobast karata the, to kai police or kendriya suraksha balon kii jasusi ke kaam main jute hue the
 Many times these people also worked to lay landmines
 haalanki ab aatmasamarpan ke baad inhe apni bhul kaa ehsaas ho rahaa he
 These people have given up on the hideous work of Naxalism
 sanvar rahaa he bhavishyasarkaar kii aatmasamarpan policy ke tahat ab inke din phir rahe hai
 Earlier, they used to roam around in Yejangal, but now their future is here
 ab to bastar ke livelihud college main in tamaam aatmasamarpit naksaliyon kaa daakhila karaayaa gaya he
 Where there is a strong arrangement to stay and eat until the training is complete
 is prashikshan ke puraa ho jane ke baad inhen rojgaar muhaiyaa karaane kii bhi yojana he
 Let us tell you that all these are being trained under the skill development scheme of the government
 is sabake bich livelihud college ke praachaarya sharadchand goud ne ye saaf kiya he ki aatmasamarpit naksaliyon kaa swabhaav or unki ruchi ke saath-saath vahaan unke manodasha kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he
 Returning to their village after being trained, this young man should not take hold of Senxalism again, care is also being taken for this
 prashikshan ke dauraan hi inhen deshbhakti or jan seva kaa paath bhi padhaayaa ja rahaa he
 The importance of democracy in their own and the development of their village has also been told, so that by going to the village, this young man can now work to connect his neighbors and colleagues to the mainstream of the country
