 The process of children coming to the police station has been going on since 2006
 iske peeche kii kahani or bhi dilachasp he
 It is such that in 2006 there was a severe flood in Barmer and the schools here were flooded with rain
 tab ramsar ke purv thana prabharee surendra kumaar ne bacchon kii padhai jari rakhane kaa bidaa uthaaya
 He started setting up a school in the police station building and became a police officer
 is anokhe skool ko naam diya gaya, apana skool
 In order to successfully carry this additional responsibility on his shoulders, the then SP Umesh Chandra Dutta deployed additional policemen in the police station
 20 bacchon ke saath shuru kiye gaye is anokhe skool main aaj 185 bachche pard rahe hai
 The policemen of the Ramsar police station are handling the law and order as well as playing the dual role of teacher
 pulicekarmiyon ke alaava skool main chaar teacher bhi hai, jinhen ahmedabad ke enjio darpan academy ne yahaan tainaat kiya he
 The salaries of the teachers are collected by the police and ngos
 ramsar thana adhikari narptdaan charan kehete hai, ‘‘enjio kii sanchaalak sara bahan or saamaajik kaaryakarta shafi mohammad kii madad ke chalate skool ke sanchaalan main koi dikkat nahin aati

 ’’thane main skool lagane se bacchon ke man se police ke prati bhay bhi kam ho rahaa he
 Superintendent of Police Rahul Barhat believes that this way children will be motivated to become IPS
 ve aage kehete hai, ‘‘hamaara jivan aam janata ko samarpit he
 It becomes our social responsibility that no child be deprived of education
 ’’is anokhe skool main aane vaale zyaadaatar bachche kamjor aarthik varg se hai
 Their parents cannot afford the education, so school fees are not charged
 apana skool main paanchavin main pard rahi kumari lila or suresh kumaar kehete hai, ‘‘yah skool nahin hota to ham kabhi pard hi nahin pate
 The financial condition of the house is not good
 ’’ chauthi class ke bharat kumaar or kumari babita kahati hai, ‘‘pulisavaale to bahut achche hote hai
 We are not scared of them at all
 hamen nahin lagata ki kisi or skool main itani acchhee padhai hoti hogi
 "perhaps this will be the only such police station in the country where there are criminals on one side and young children on the other side
" yah thana nishchit hi deshbhar main misaal kaayam kar rahaa he
 The good thing is that since the start of the school, seven in-charge of the police station have changed so far, but no one has let this spark of education spread

 BJP sources say that the party's state unit has been confused about Akash

 Therefore, the focus of the state leadership is on the intention of the central leadership
 uske baad hi aage koi faisla hoga
 According to sources, the party has sought reports of the entire incident in Indore on June 26, as well as a list of leaders who came out in support of Akash and those who welcomed him when he was released from jail
 sambhaavna he ki kendriya netritv kii raay saamne aane ke baad party kii rajya ikai koi bada faisla le sakati he
 In this situation, it is also considered certain to fall with the sky on those leaders who were seen standing with the sky

 iske baad bhaajapa ke kai netaa unke samarthan main aae or jab akaash jail se reeha hue to unka swaagat bhi hua
 Prior to Prime Minister Modi's statement, BJP leaders openly supported Akash, but now everyone is silent

 barmer jila nirvachan adhikari bhanu prakaash ne bataaya ki bhaajapa ke karnal sonaaram ne do set namakan ke daakhil kiye hai

 lambey samay se team india ko ek 'chinamen' gendbaaj kii darkaar thi, ye talash ab puri hoti najar aa rahi he
 Chinaman has been seen in spin bowler Kuldeep Yadav, who plays for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), but it remains to be seen how his spin in international cricket shows
 westeindies ke khilaaf hone vaali gharelu vanade siries ke pehle teen maichon ke liye kuldeep ko14 sadasyeey team main jagahade di gai he or ummid he ki unhen match international kariyar kaa pehla match khilne kaa mauka bhi jarur milegaa
 After the Under-19 World Cup, Kuldeep performed brilliantly in the current season of Champions League and managed to make a place in Team India
 champions lig ke final main keker ko pahunchane main is gendbaaj ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 For Kuldeep, Sunil Gavaskar even said that if i was a selector, i would have picked it in the Test team without having played a first class match
 gavaskar hi hai jinhone bahut kam umr main sachin tendulkar kii pratibha ko bhi pahachaanaa tha
 After that, there is no need to tell anyone what the master blaster showed after joining international cricket
 kuldeep ne abhi tak kul 8 tii-20 match khele hai, jinamein unka iconmi rate 5
 There have been 53 and 12 in his account
 64 kii ausat se 14 wicket bhi hai
 In T20 cricket, this economy rate tells what kind of bowler Kuldeep is
 under-19 team ke liye australia gaye kuldeep jab bharat laute to unhen mumbai indiens team se judana tha
 During the net session, Tendulkar asked someone to send new boys Kuldeep, i want to see how he bowls? Kuldeep threw the first five balls for a normal Chinese delivery but both of them were surprised to see what happened on the sixth ball
 kuldeep kii gend par tendulkar kaa middle stump ukhd gaya
 Tendulkar went to this batsman and said- 'well bouldered Kuldeep
 ' ek intervyuu main kuldeep ne ye baat khud bataai thi
 Kuldeep has told that he wants to become a bowler like Shane Warne
 champions lig main is gendbaaj ne abhi tak chaar match khele hai or 6 wicket apni jholii main daal chukaa he
 He has a good economy rate in all these matches
 under-19 team ke liye is spinner ne 2 match khele or teen wicket jatke the
 Now it is to be seen that if Kuldeep gets a chance against the West Indies, then how do he trap the Caribbean batsmen in his spin

 Explain that the BJP has not given tickets to LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi this time
 alke adwani gandhinagar se saansad hai, magar is baar unki jagah bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko tikat diya gaya he

 LK Advani, once called the iron man of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has not been fielded by his own party this time, citing his age
 itnaa hi nahin, bijepi ne apni umr vaali policy ke tahat kai kai bujurg netaaon ko tikat nahin diya he
 The bjp's top leadership itself took the initiative to cut the ticket of leaders who have crossed 75 years
 haalanki isse pehle hui party kii baithak ke baad media main yah khabar ai thi ki bujurg netaaon ko party bhale ladayegi, magar unhen sarkaar main kisi tarah kii jimmedaari nahin di jaaegi
 But now the party decided to give rest to the elderly leaders instead of fielding them

 However, no sudden reason has been given as to how Uddhav Thackeray's name came to the post of Chief Minister, suddenly leaving Aditya's name behind
 shivasena lagaataar bhaajapa ko is baat ke liye kah rahi thi ki vah uske bina bhi sarkaar bana sakati he
 In the past, soft statements were also being made by the Shiv Sena for the Congress and the Nationalist Congress (NCP)
 aise main kayaas ye bhi lag rahaa he ki teenon partiyon ke bich sarkaar gathan ko lekar kuch khichdi pak rahi he

 antie laabhakaari sanstha nahin he
 RTI activist Gaur says that NEET-2019 examination has been conducted only after paying a hefty fee from the candidates, so it would be better in the larger public interest that the National Testing Agency go ahead and disclose the cost incurred on this examination

 He said, 'my account was hacked
 unhone safai dete hue kaha ki unka acountnitish kumaror bijepi netaa susheel modi ke ishaare par hack kiya gaya or ulta sidhaa post bhi kiya gaya
 Tejapratap alleged that all his social media accounts were hacked by opponents upset by his growing popularity
 jisaki shikaayat vah police main bhi karenge
 But when the police complained, they did not say
 NO ENTRY kaa poster liye media ke saamne aae tejpratap kaa makasad badhate paariwarik tanaav ke bich safai dena tha
 On the other hand, Janata Dal u spokesperson Sanjay Singh said on this whole episode that if someone hacked their account then why did they not register an FIR in the police
 sibar cell sab pataa laga legaa
 He said that this is nothing but a family fight
 sanjay singh ne twit karke kaha ki ek kahawat to suni hogi aapane tejasvi yadav ki ghar kaa bhedi lanka dhaae
 Now slowly it will appear to be the manifestation of this saying
 duraachaar kii lanka ke vikaas kaa antim kaaran vibhishana hi bana tha
 The same recurrence is happening with the empire of corruption
 yun to bihar or tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main dur-dur tak koi samanta nahin, lekin wike shashikala ko dekh rabari kii yaad taaja ho hi jaati he
 
 
 There are many similarities between the two, which remind political pundits once again about the politics of Bihar
 darasal, jayalalita kii maut ke baad panniraselvam ko siem banaaya gaya
 But recently he resigned from the post, clearing the way for Sasikala to become CM
 lekin ab vah phir chaah rahe hai ki vahi mukhyamantri bane rahen, jabaki vidhayak bal shashikala ke saath he
 Sasikala and Rabri Devi have both ventured straight out of politics
 lalu prasad yadav ke jail jane ke baad rabari devi ko bihar kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya tha
 Rabri Devi had no experience of politics
 rabari ko patni hone kaa laabh mila jabaki shashikala ko kareebi dost
 When Rabri Devi became the Chief Minister, questions were also raised about her not contesting elections
 vahiin shashikala ko lekar bhi uth rahe hai ki vah kabhi chunaavon main nahin utrin
 Rabri was also made the chief minister under the circumstances
 bas rabari ko yah phayda tha ki jail main baithe lalu prasad yadav us samay maardarshak kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe the, jabaki shashikala ke saath aisa koi nahin dikhataa
 Lalu was in jail when Rabri became CM
 rabari ke saamne sabase badi chunauti party ko ekajute rakhkar satta sanbhale rakhane kii thi
 The challenge of keeping the party united is also in front of Sasikala
 party main vidhayakon kii badi sankhya shashikala ke saath hi he lekin party main do dhade kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 So Sasikala's first attempt is to keep the party united
 tippaniyan Along with this, it was the main thing that Sasikala kept away from the media in front of Rabri and Jayalalithaa while Lalu was the Chief Minister
 yaa yun kahen ki donon hi lau profile main raheen or achaanak se hai profile ban gayi
 Rabri alleged that she got the chair luckily because her husband Lalu Prasad Yadav was the Chief Minister
 isse log unase bhi naaraaz dikhe
 
 rabari ko jan samarthan hasil karne ke liye sangharsh karnaa padaa
 The same is with Sasikala
 logon kaa kahana he ki vah jayalalita kii dost hai sirf isliye mukhyamantri bana diya jaae yah thik nahin
 People's sympathy is more visible with Panneerselvam
 shashikala or rabari devi donon hi sidhe ghar se nikalakar raajnneeti main pahunchi hai
 Rabri Devi was made the Chief Minister of Bihar after Lalu Prasad Yadav was imprisoned
 rabari devi ke paas raajnneeti kaa koi anubhav nahin tha
 Rabri had the benefit of being a wife while Sasikala was a close friend
 rabari devi jab mukhyamantri baniin to unke chunaav na ladane ko lekar bhi sawaal uthe the
 At the same time, they are also getting up about Sasikala that she never went to the elections
 rabari ko bhi paristhitavash mukhyamantri bana diya gaya tha
 Just Rabri had the advantage that Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was sitting in jail, was playing the role of a guide at the time, whereas none of this was seen with Sasikala
 jab rabari siem bani thim to lalu jail main the
 The biggest challenge before Rabri was to keep the party united and hold power
 party ko ekajute rakhane kii chunauti shashikala ke saamne bhi he
 a large number of mlas in the party are with Sasikala but the possibility of two factions in the party cannot be ruled out
 isliye shashikala kii bhi pehali koshish party ko ekajute rakhana he
 The comments iske saath hi yah pramukh baat rahi ki lalu ke mukhyamantri hote hue rabari or jayalalita ke saamne shashikala media se dur raheen
 Or rather, both of them were in law profile and suddenly became high profile
 rabari par aarope laga ki unhen kursi bhagyavash mil gai kyonki unke pati lalu prasad yadav mukhyamantri the
 This also made people angry with him
 
 Rabri had to struggle to gain public support
 vahi haal shashikala ke saath bhi he
 People say that she is Jayalalithaa's friend just because she is made Chief Minister is not right
 logon kii sahanubhuti panniraselvam ke saath zyada dikh rahi he

 We will die "tippaniyan Hundreds of villages such as Mahda, Chakka, Tilampur, Namapur, Varadih, Khonchwa, Akhri Chitouni of Banaras, including Jagdevpur, have poor farmers cultivating Bataiya and Rehan
 inkaa sabase bada dard yahi he ki kisi tarah paise juta kar, udhaar lekar inhone kheti kii or ab jab fasal nasht ho gai he to inhen muaavja bhi nahin milegi
 Not only this, the person who has the land will have to pay the mortgage amount
 ab ye unke raham-o-karam par hai
 This is a painful truth because the lifeless landless farmers who cultivate ren and bataiya are halfway alive without land and this time the rain has washed away all their hard work
 lihaaja unki jindagi ekadam bejaar ho chuki he
 The big question is: will such farmers get a place in the list of compensation? Are these farmers on the government's agenda or not? If not, then you can think yourself how will they live and if they are alive in any way, then how will they live? parivaar apane kheton kaa ek hissaa rehan par rakhata he or ek hissaa batiya par detaa he
 The farm and seeds are mine in Bataiya
 baaki mehnat duusare kisaan kii, phir jo fasal hui wo baant lee gai
 He paid a fixed amount to the farmer who took the farm
 phir saal bhar ke liye khet uskaa
 There are a large number of farmers in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar who are landless, but raise and cultivate fields from people like me
 agar kisi ne das acre jameen rehan par lee to uske liye mote taur par alag-alag ilaake or khet ke hisaab se saath hajaar se ek lakh rupee tak kii rakam lagati he
 Apart from that, the cost of growing the crop separately
 in kisaano kii sankhya kitni he iske aankade main ulajhane ke bajaay yahi kahana zyaada uchit hoga ki hamaare desh ke asli anndaata yahi chote kisaan hai
 These farmers have been destroyed by the weather
 aaj sarkaar hisaab laga rahi he ki kisaanon ko kya muaavja diya jaae
 The Central Government is putting the responsibility of the plight of the farmers at the Center and the State Governments at the states
 sansad main rahul gandhi, pradhanmantri narendra modi ko kisaanon ke bich jane kii salaah de rahe hai
 This pain of the political parties is increasing in the social media not only in the Parliament but for their own benefit
 modi ke videsh daure par sawaal uth rahe hai
 It means to say that the issue of ruined and dying farmers is becoming Rahul vs Modi
 jahaan tak kisaanon kii baat he to abhi tak unke nuksaan kaa survey tak nahin ho sakaa he
 By the time all this happens, the time to sow the next crop will come
 lekin ye fasal kaise boi jaaegi ye bada sawaal kisaanon ke saamne he
 Where will the devastated and ruined farmers raise money for the next crop seeds, manure, water and pesticides
 karj main dub chuke bhoomihin kisaanon ko agali kheti ke liye ab karj koun degaa? or pichhlaa karj wo kaise chukaayenge? kitni ladakiyon kii shaadiyaan tal jaaengi
 How many children will have to leave their studies
 kitne kisaan apana ghar-baar bechakar shaharon ke majdoor ban jaaenge
 The farmers are in so much pain that i and you will get tired of telling them, but their stories will not be reduced
 batiya or rehan par khet lekar guzar-basar karne vaale kisaanon kii sthiti to bhayaavah he
 Their deposits have gone
 karj bad chukaa he or khaane ke liye anaaj bhi nahin he
 And the cruel joke is that they will not even get compensation
 khet unke naam par nahin he or khet hi nahin hai to muaavja kaisaa? kitna vibhats he yah, iskaa andaja shaharon main rahane vaale log nahin laga sakate
 In such a situation, how will these farmers be provided relief? isi sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye ham pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi ke ek gaanv jagardevapur gaye
 But instead of getting answers there, many new questions were found
 hira laal is gaanv kii harijan basti se rahete hai
 He is landless and planted three bighas on potted area
 barish ne kuch nahin choda
 Hiralal has become ill in this sorrow
 charpai par lete rahete hai, lekin jab enditivi kii team inkaa haal jaanane pahunchi to yah kisi madad kii aas main uth khadey hue
 In summer, even after wearing a shawl, he walked towards the field apni barbaad fasal dikhaakar unhone apana gam bayaan kiya
 "the situation was one damme down ba, three bigha liye kulhi were destroyed
 ab hamen kaa mili kaa na mili wo t bataai dihe
 " gaanv ke malik yadav kaa bhi yahi haal he
 They had rented two bigha fields and are now trying to extract some workable material from the wasted grains
 unhone hamen bataaya ki kaise pani kii vajah se anaaj sad gaya he
 The same situation is with Salik Ram
 vahiin hamen barbaad fasal ko niharti piyaari bhi mili
 Piari has a wedding and the crop is ruined
 vah samaj nahin paa rahi he ki kya kare? saare raste band ho gaye hai
 "three big houses, we have taken the field, our house is quick, and our house is married
 ab i batai ham kekare boote biyah kari
 Everyone is crying at home
 he bhagwaan i kauna musiibat main daal dehala
 " rehan par kheti karne vaale kisaan chhunna laal hamen dekhakar is aas main daudte chale aae ki sahab aae hai
 Inspecting the wasted crop
 aate hi foran apane barbaad khet kii taraf chalane kii zid karne lage par jab hamane unase rehan khet lene waalon ke bare main poocha to foran fat pade, kaha sahab se mulaakaat ham khud rehan par khet liye hai
 The name of the farm
 adhiya vaale kheti kiye he jutai kiye he, benga daale he surra khaad daale he apana kharchaa laga diye hai unako kya milegaa
 The tenant will get it, what will we get? ham to mar jaaenge
 "comments jagardevapur samet banaras ke mahadaa, chakkaa, tilampur, namapur, wardih, khonchvaa, akhri chhitauni jaise saikadon gaanv main batiya or rehan par kheti karne vaale kisaan badahavaas hai
 Their biggest pain is that by raising money, somehow they did farming by borrowing and now when the crop is destroyed, they will not get compensation
 yahi nahin jisaki jameen he use rehan kii rakam to deni hi hogi
 Now they are on their mercy
 ye ek dardanaak sach he kyonki rehan or batiya par kheti karne vaale bhoomihin kisaanon kii zindagi jameen ke bina vaise bhi aadhi he or is baar kii barish ne unki sari mehnat dho di he
 Hence, his life has become completely lifeless
 bada sawaal ye he ki muaavjon kii list main kya aise kisaanon ko jagah milegi? ye kisaan sarkaar ke agenda main hai bhi yaa nahin? agar nahin to aap khud soch sakate hai ki ye kaise jinda rahenge or kisi tarah jinda bhi rahe to kis haal main jienge? Instead of getting entangled in the figure of the number of these farmers, it would be more appropriate to say that the real farmers of our country are these small farmers

 The big question is: will such farmers get a place in the list of compensation? Are these farmers on the government's agenda or not? If not, then you can think yourself how will they live and if they are alive in any way, then how will they live? batiya or rehan par khet lekar guzar-basar karne vaale kisaanon kii sthiti to bhayaavah he
 Their deposits have gone

 And the cruel joke is that they will not even get compensation

 In such a situation, how will these farmers be provided relief? isi sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye ham pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi ke ek gaanv jagardevapur gaye
 But instead of getting answers there, many new questions were found
 hira laal is gaanv kii harijan basti se rahete hai
 He is landless and planted three bighas on potted area

 Hira Lal hails from Harijan colony of this village
 wo bhoomihin hai or unhone teen bigha khet rehan par lekar fasal lagaai thi
 The rain left nothing
 heeralaal is gam main biimaar ho gaye hai
 They lie on the bed, but when the NDTV team reached to know their condition, they stood up for some help
 garmi main bhi shawl odh kar khet kii taraf chal die
 He expressed his sorrow by showing his ruined crop
 "halaat ek damme down ba, teen bighaa liye the kulhi naash kar diye
 Now we can not find Ka Mili Ka
 " Malik Yadav of the village has the same situation
 unhone do bigha khet kiraaye par liya tha or ab barbaad ho chuke anaaj main se kuch kaam laayak nikaalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 He told us how the grains have rot due to water
 yahi haal saalik ram kaa bhi he
 At the same time we also got piercing the wasted crop
 piyaari ke ghar shaadi he or fasal barbaad ho gai
 She does not understand what to do? All roads are closed

 He had no harm in running a sewing machine
 aise kapade silata ki fishan kii duniya se jude log vaah-vaah kar uthte
 But he was the star behind the curtain
 kapade beshak vahi silata par vaahvahee uskifaishan dizinerko milti
 This story is from a famous fashion designer and tailor of Delhi
 ek aise darzi kii jisaki nazar ek rose fishan diziner kii daulat par ja gadi
 Just to get the same wealth he put scissors, took up the dagger
 raat 10 baje, lakhaniz e-82, vasant kunj ankalev, saooth dillidilli kii jaani maani fishan diziner or soshlitemala lakhanike bangale ke bahari get par door bel baji
 Since this bungalow is so big, it took some time for the middle aged Bahadur to come from the main house to the outer door
 fishan industry main maala behad mashhoor thim
 
 dilli ke posh vasant kunj ilaake main is bangale ke alaava unka dilli main ek boutique bhi tha
 Which was the fashion hub of the influential and rich women
 isi boutique ke liye wo apane is bangale main dresses taiyaar karwaati thim
 She used to design the dress herself
 magar unki silaai ke liye unhone ek tailor ko rakhaa hua tha
 On 14 November 2018, Wednesday, 10 pm, his teller Rahul came in Bangla number A-8
 dress lekar
 He had two companions with him
 wo bhi tailor the
 So, despite being late at night, he got an entry in the bungalow
 bangale ke ek kamare ko maala ne apana workshop bana rakhaa tha
 Where Rahul, with the help of his two companions, was showing Mala the dress
 tabhi maala ne jaise hi dress main kuch tabdiliyaan karne kii baat shuru kii
 According to the sources, Rahul took out that knife hidden in his clothes and started snatching it in the garland
 uske do saathiyon ne maala ko pakad rakhaa tha or rahul lagaataar maala ko chaaku martha ja rahaa tha ki tabhi naukar bahadur ne cheekh pukaar kii awaz suni or maala ko bachaane ke liye inase bhid gaya
 But after killing the garland, these people also sacked Bahadur's body with knives
 chand minuton main dabl murder ke baad bade itminan se in teenon logon ne bangale main jamkar lutpaat kii or nakadi zevar ke alaava keemtee saamaan batore
 And then escaped after filling it in Mala's car
 khun se sani maala or naukar bahadur kii laash bangale ke andar thi
 And no one even knew about it outside
 sard raat hone kii vajah se log apane apane gharon main hi the
 After killing in the bungalow of Delhi's posh Vasant Kunj Enclave, Rahul and his companions roamed in different areas of Delhi in the car of Mala Lakhani
 unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki luute hue maal or car ko lekar wo jaaen to kahaan jaaen? kyonki unhen bhi pataa tha ki bangale main lage sisitivi camere main unke aane or car se waapas jane kii tasviren kaid ho chuki hai
 So he was so terrified of them that before this double murder could be revealed and the police would find him
 unhone khud hi thane main pahunch karasarendorkar diya
 On the intervening night of 14 and 15, this house in Vasant Kuj, one of the most posh areas of Delhi, had been double murdered
 magar puraa ilaaka anjaan tha
 Even the police patrolling the area did not even know it
 chaaku lagane ke baad bhi agar logon ko pataa chal jaataa to maala lakhaani or unke naukar bahadur batch sakate the
 But now the expectation was very low
 kyonki kareeb 5 ghante biit chuke the
 On 15 November 2018, at 3 am, the policemen of Vasant Kunj police station posted at Vasant Kunj police station night duty were surprised at that time
 jab raat kareeb 3 baje ye teen ladke thane pahunche
 Before the police could understand anything, these three created a sensation in the whole police station saying that they have killed Delhi famous fashion designer Mala Lakhani and her servant Bahadur in Vasant Kunj Eclave bungalow A-82
 shuruuaat main police ko yakeen nahin hua magar phir in teenon main se rahul ne bataaya ki wo maala lakhaani ke bangale main tailor ke taur par kaam karata he or usne apane saathiyon ke saath milakar is dabl murder ko anjaam diya
 There is also looting in the bungalow
 yahaan tak kii bangale se bhaagane ke liye unhone maala kii dundai car bhi bangale se uthaai he
 Which is currently standing outside the police station
 police ne rahul or uske donon saathi rahamat or basit ke nishaan dehi par jab bangala number i-82 kii padtaal kii to uske hosh phakta ho gaye
 The bungalow was actually covered with the blood-stained corpse of 53-year-old famous fashion design Mala Lakhani and her 50-year-old servant Bahadur
 rahul ke kahe mutabik bangale kii haalat se saaf nazar aa rahaa tha ki yahaan bade itminan se lutpaat bhi kii gai he
 After sending the two dead bodies for postmortem, the police began investigating the matter and the stolen goods were recovered from the locations reported by Rahul and his friends
 sisitivi kii tasviren bhi is baat kii tasdik kar rahi thim ki raat 10 baje hi ye teenon bangala number i-82 main ghuse or kareeb 1 ghante baad maala lakhaani kii is hundai car main baithkar bangale se nikle bhi
 On 15 November 2018, at 5 am, Vasant Kunj Police Station, Delhi, continued to conduct police investigations for two hours
 magar bangale par logon kaa jamaavada shuru hua, subah kareeb 5 baje sabase pehle padosi shakeel ahamed ne maala ke bangale ke baahar police ko dekha
 Immediately on reaching the spot, it was found that Mala and her servant had been killed by adopting knives
 logon ko yakeen nahin ho rahaa tha ki hameshaa shant rahane vaali maala ko koi kyon maaregaa
 Since Mala was not married, the matter of domestic quarrel was never revealed
 sawaal ye tha ki agar rahul ne maala kii hatya kii saazish 10 din pehle se kerani shuru kar di thi
 So why did he surrender and when he had to surrender, then why did he loot after the murder and when he did the robbery then why did he confess to the looting
 to phir sau baat kii ek baat ye he ki tailor ne kyon kiya fishan diziner kaa murder?haalanki police ne is baat kii philhal tasdik nahin kii
 But one thing is certain that the police will never get to know about this high profile double murder of Delhi so soon, if the murderers themselves did not reach the police station and confess their crime

 jharkhand main party ke ummidavaaron ke liye prachaar karne congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi buudhvaar ko rajya main aa rahe hai, lekin party ke netaa or kaaryakarta maanakar chal rahe hai ki chunavi nateezon par iskaa koi khaas asar nahin hone vaala
 Major Congress leaders are also heard making the same claim these days that their party will be the largest party among the UPA constituents in the results of the assembly elections, but the thing to remember is that the Congress of the UPA constituents Apart from this, there are only Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Janata Dal United (JDU) which, if they get even two to four seats in these elections, then they are satisfactory It will be seen
 congress party kii durdasha kaa alam yah he ki agar aap ranchi se kisi bhi disha main 200 kilometre kii bhi yatra kar lenge, to bhartiya janata party (bijepi) or jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo) ke saikadon kii taadaad main lage postaron-bannron kii tulana main congress ke poster-binar ikkaa-dukka hi dikhenge
 The Congress did not even have a star campaigner during the entire 45-day election campaign to end on Thursday
 darasal, party kii shuruyaat hi kharaab rahi thi, or vah kuch netaaon kii zid kii vajah se argedy or jhamumo ke saath 'mahagathbandhan' banane se chook gai, kyonki agar jhamumo ke saath gathbandhan hota to shaayad parinaam kuch behatar ho sakate the
 Secondly, due to arrogance the party leaders could not take Babulal Marandi as well, due to which the party did not even have any special face left
 party ke bheetar gutbaji kaa alam yah he ki koi bhi netaa kisi duusare ke saath sanyukt rup se prachaar karne tak nahin jaataa
 Above all, the high command is far from winning the election, neither has it made any strategy, nor has it provided resources to fight
 udhar, bijepi, jiske liye khud pradhanmantri narendra modi or party adhyaksh amit shah na sirf prachaar kii kaman sanbhale rahe, balki har kshetra main chunaav jeetne ke liye ranneeti banane yaa sansaadhan muhaiyaa karaane main bhi koi kasar nahin chodi
 So, if the Congress is reduced to a few seats in the state, it will not be surprising at all
 lekin ab bada sawaal yah he ki aakhir party loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon ke sadame se kab ubregi, or kab apane kaaryakartaaon-netaaon ke saath ek shashakt vikalp kii bhoomika nibhaayegi, yaa vah jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav kii tarah hi kuch or rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi haath par haath dhare baithi rahegi

 So, should the Muslims of the country look at Modi in the eyes of hope and will Modi get the votes of Muslims? The question that has been raised since long is whether Narendra Modi will be the next face of BJP? But i say that BJP should present them first
 isiilie is sawaal kaa jawaab abhi dena jaldbaaji hogi
 Is the attitude of Muslims changing? In recent elections, Narendra Modi has got votes in many places
 halaat badal rahe hai, jamaana badal rahaa he
 So is the Muslim attitude towards Modi softening? Can't say that
 par haa, kuch vot to unhone liye hai, isamen shaq nahin
 Do you consider development as the reason? Gujarat's growth was to some extent because of Modi's vote, on the other hand, some people considered Modi to be better than others
 vastanvi ne bayaan diya tha ki 2002 ke dangon ko bhuulakar musalamaanon ko aage baduya chahie

 abhi bhartiya musalamaanon ke saamne yah sawaal nahin aayaa he ki ve modi ko chune yaa choden
 If you look at the Sachar Committee report, the condition of Muslims in Gujarat is better than other states
 ise is tarah nahin dekha janaa chahie ki gujarat main halaat behatar hai, balki yah kah sakate hai ki baaki rajyon main halaat zyada kharaab hai
 Like West Bengal
 gujarat kii jelon main jitne log band hai, usase zyada maharashtra main band hai, haalanki vahaan secular party kii hukumat he
 There are some truths, which should not be ignored
 shiksha, rojgaar ye ahm paimaane hai or modi raaj main log surakshit mahasoos karte hai
 The accident of 2002 and the pride Modi has been talking about is a major hindrance in his victory
 aisa nahin he ki sab kuch thik he
 Yes, there is a matter of education, employment but that too has been going on already
 par kuch to vikaas modi ne kiya he, yah aap maanate hai?nahin, isko vikaas ke andaaj se nahin dekh sakate kyonki jab ham maharashtra, pashchim bengal se tulana karte hai to lagata he ki yakeenan kuch fark he
 But Modi's presentations and speeches during the elections are related to the 2002 riots
 par is baar ke prachaar main na hindutv kii baat hui, na dangon kii
 It was only about development
 baat hui, par saath hi afsos bhi hona chahie
 The loss was caused by India
 to usko majahab se yaa dharm se na jodakar usee tarah dekha janaa chahie tha
 Do you blame Modi for the 2002 riots? Should they apologize? There is no question of apology
 doshiyon ko sajaa mili, yah bharat ke liye bahut jaruri he
 There is a dispute about the way Afzal was hanged
 aapako lagata he ki sarkaar pehle bataa detii to faansee ho hi nahin paati?vah kyun? court kaa faisla he or vahiin se amal par roak lag sakati he
 But if there was another method adopted, there would be no hanging
 sawaal yah paidaa hota he ki vah tarika apanaate to faansee kaise rukati? or agar rukati to iskaa arth yah hua ki koi prakriya baaki he
 You are hanging without completing the process
 kya is desh kii nyaayik vyavastha, sarkaar or log itane kamjor hai ki mujrim ko sajaa nahin de sakate? aapane choron kii tarah afjal ko faansee di, or maanavtaa ko bhul gaye
 You also did the same thing that Naxalites do
 par faansee kii sajaa to court ne hi di thi
 She is fine, but could Afzal not see his wife and children once before dying? Could it not have been arranged? Is politics the real reason for this? People are saying so, it is felt that the Congress took this step seeing Modi's face moving forward
 to kya isse kashmir main aag lagegi? kya iskaa ulataa asar hoga?sirf kashmir kii baat nahin he
 In this country too, there is more of such people, who have rejected this method as wrong, this method is political understanding, not the way of justice
 maang ho rahi he ki afjal kii laash lautaa di jaae
 i do not want to go to this detail
 ab laash yahaan rahe yaa vahaan, kuch fark nahin padataa
 As 2014 draws closer, the UPA has been accused of trying to create communal sentiments for its own personal gain
 main aise logon ko desh kaa dushman or gaddaar samajhataa hum
 Those who create such an atmosphere, they can neither be friends of Hindus, nor of Muslims nor of the country
 kya grih mantri scindia ne bhagava aatankwaad kii baat raajnneeti ke liye kii?bilkul
 Terrorism should not name any religion
 par pichley kitne saalon se islam ko aatankwaad kaa naam kaha gaya, us par kisi ne koi hangaamaa nahin kiya
 We heard the statement of Owaisi and Togadia
 aap kya kahenge?is desh kii kaman ab naujavaanon ke haath main he or mujhe yakeen he ki ye noujvaan 2014 main aise logon kaa ilaaj jarur karenge
 Now the thing will be just justice, humanity, unity-integrity, development and corrupt leaders
 yah shaayad isliye ho rahaa he ki 2014 main musalmaan sarkaar kii taraf aa jaaen
 Some put Islam at risk and some Hindutva
 kya hindutv or islam itane kamjor hai ki ye kuch log unhen kidanap kar len? Ram Rahim, convicted of rape by two saints, is serving 20 years in Rohtak's Sunaria jail
 lekin usase jude karnaamon ke khulaase kaa silsilaa jari he
 Playing with the faith of the followers of the camp, Gurmeet was collecting crores of rupees every year

 At the behest of him, Ram Rahim started the business of musical nights and filmmaking
 vah ek raat main lav charger jaise geet gaakar karodon rupee bator letaa tha
 Many of his films were featured in the hundred crore club
 pichley 3-4 saalon ke dauraan hi deraa kii aamadani main kai guna kaa oochaal aayaa
 But the big question is that despite the huge amount of money of the dera, why did the court commissioner and the police recover only Rs 12000 cash from the dera? Where did the dera go for crores of rupees? Where did Honeypreet Akhir run away from the dera in two big suitcases on the night of 28th? Where did the 5 crores to give to the mercenaries to spread violence in Panchkula? These are all questions that the police have to find the answer

 haalanki kai netaa ab bhi yah maan rahe hai pranab mukherjee kaa aresas ke kaarykram main janaa congress or 'secular' kheme ke liye nuksaandeh he

 bihar ke mujffarpur jile main 100 se zyada bacchon kii maut kii khabar ne desh ko jhakzor kar rakh diya he
 Everyone from the Union Minister to the Minister of State is visiting there, but the process of death of children is not taking the name of stopping
 isi mudde par enditivi ke patrakaron ne mujffarpur ke saansad ajay nishad, lok janashakti party ke saansad chiraag paswan, bihar ke mantri suresh sharma or kendriya swasthya mantri se is silsile main baat kii
 Everyone expressed concern but the reality is still that there have been no significant changes in the Muzaffarpur Medical College regarding medical facilities
 mujffarpur se bijepi saansad ajay nishad ne kaha ki chamaki bukhaar ke liye 4ji jimmedaar he
 The village MP described the village, heat, poverty and filth as 4G and said that people belonging to extremely backward society are related to this disease
 mujffarpur ke saansad ajay nishad ne kaha ki bihar main garmi zyada pad rahi he or marane vaale adhikansh bachche garib tabake se hai
 When the NDTV journalist asked him to tell me some two works that would show that the government had done something to deal with the situation, MP Ajay Nishad said that government hospitals are being prepared and a 100-bed separate hospital Will form, as the Union Health Minister has said
 jab unase yah poocha gaya ki yah to tatkaal main hota nahin dikh rahaa, maut nahin ruuk rahi he, swasthya mantri press conference main cricket match kii baat poochhate hai, aise main kahi koi gambhirtha nahin dikh rahi he
 Denying these questions, the MP said that all are serious on this issue
 udhar lok janashakti party ke saansad chiraag paswan ne kaha he ki paksh or vipaksh ko aise samay main ek jute hokar kaam karnaa chahie
 Although it was the responsibility of the state government, but why it did not happen is a question
 jab chiraag se poocha gaya ki 2014 main hi vaada kiya gaya tha ki 100 bed kaa aspataal banaaya jayega lekin abhi tak to kuch hua nahin
 On this question Chirag said that what has happened and what has not happened, there is no point in going on this now
 bihar ke mantri suresh sharma ne kaha he ki 200 se zyada bachche thik hokar aspataal se waapas ghar gaye hai unka zikr bhi hona chahie

 In this press conference, Union Minister of State for Health Ashwani Choubey was seen sleeping, while Bihar Health Minister Mangal Pandey was asking cricket updates
 kendriya swasthya mantri se jab mujffarpur kii ghatana par sawaal kiya gaya to unka kahana tha ki jo bhi sansaadhan kii jarurat he use puraa kiya ja rahaa he
 However, when a cricket update was asked by the Health Minister of Bihar during the press conference, when the Health Minister was questioned about his seriousness, he could not refrain from answering it
 is bich 107 bacchon kii maut ke baad aaj pehali baar bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar mujffarpur medical college kaa daura kiya
 The chain of death in the hospital started 17 days ago which is still continuing
 puure bihar main abhi tak 126 bacchon kii maut ho chuki he
 There is a lot of displeasure with this attitude of the Chief Minister
 samooche bihar main jari acute incephelitis syndrome (AES) ke tandav main sava sau se zyaada, or sirf mujaffarpur main 109 bacchon ke kaal ke gaal main samaa jane ke baad soobe ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko fursat mili, or mangalvaar ko vah mujaffarpur ke shri krishna medical college evam aspataal (SKMCH) pahunche, jahaan ab tak 89 bacchon kii maut ho chuki he
 Apart from SKMCH, 19 children have also fallen victim to this deadly disease at Kejriwal Hospital in Muzaffarpur
 is beemaari ke sabase zyaada shikaar mujaffarpur main hi dekhne ko mil rahe hai, or mangalvaar subah SKMCH ke suparintendent sunil kumaar shahi ne jaankaree di thi ki kul milakar aspataal main 330 bacchon ko acute encephelitis syndrome (AES) ke chalate bhartee karavaaya gaya, jinamein se 100 ko ilaaj ke baad chuttee di ja chuki he, or 45 bacchon ko mangalvaar ko discharge kar diya jayega
 In just 17 days, the disease has killed more than a hundred children in the same city, and before the Chief Minister, State Health Minister Mangal Pandey also reached Muzaffarpur for the first time on Monday, where he met patients and their families
 Apart from this, i also talked to doctors

 Seven-year-old Ramadani does not know how Yamuna was before
 isaki safai par sarkaar kitne arab rupye lutaa chuki he
 All he knows is that he has to spend a hundred and a half hundred rupees every day for 6-7 hours by diving in this mud-baked river mil jate hai
 He lives with his elder brother Sharif and sister Alekha near Nani in a makeshift hut under the British-era iron bridge in the National Capital Region

 Mother died

 '' yah kehete hue uske chehre par shikan nahin aati
 As if he is used to this life
 teenon bhai-bahan sikaa nikaalane ke baad jaakar nani ko paise dete hai or usee se guzar-basar hoti he
 58 per cent of the garbage in the capital Delhi is covered in this holy river every day, which has made this clear-looking river of sky color so black that even the black color will fade
 phir bhi yah dilli kii saikadon jindagiyon kaa sahaara he
 85-year-old Brijendra Sangma is a resident of Shillong, but now Kudasia Ghat of Yamuna is his place
 ve bataate hai, ''chota tha tabhi maa-baap mar gaya, phir ghar chhod diya
 Having grown up, got a job in the army

 '' haad-maance ke putale kii tarah dikhne vaale sangama subah 9-10 baje nadi main ghus jate hai or shaam ko 4-5 baje baahar nikalate hai

 Only one or two coins have been received
 parason hamako 8 gram sona mila tha
 Here comes a goldsmith

 "sangma says," We get fever due to sitting empty
 dekhne main yamuna kaa pani ganda he, lekin pavitra he
 When i get a wound, it is cured within two-three days of being under water
 is pani main kabhi khujali nahin hoti
 However, 8 divers died in 2003 under the waters of the river as toxic gas is produced many times from the dirt
 ye gotaakhor pani main milane vaale sikke ko apane munh main rakhte hai
 Their roof is open sky, so on most days they fill their stomach with leftover stale food
 kabhi-kabhaar dilli sarkaar ke jan aahaar kii gaadi bhi ghaaton par pahunch jaati he
 On cleaning of this river which has been converted into a drain, the Government of India is worth about Rs 27,500 crore
 (50 karod dollar) kharch kar chuki he
 How the robbery took place in the name of cleanliness is exemplified by a diver Augustine
 ve kehete hai, ''jab bhi safai ke liye badi filmi hastiyon ke saath abhiyaan chalaaya jaataa he to ham jaise logon ko 80 ru
 Are given and asked to remove the waste
 phir photo khinchvaane ke baad sab bhul jate hai
 56-year-old Augustine came to Delhi from Ahmednagar in Maharashtra in search of work at a young age
 shuruyaat main ajmeri get par palledaari kii naukari kii, lekin nahaane-dhone yamuna ke ghat par aate the
 He says, "then there was a fair here
 pani ekadam saaf tha
 People used to throw from one penny to 10 paisa, which was clearly visible in water
 logon ko dekha to isi main lag gaye or kharch laayak paisa milane laga
 "while a large number of people who have dipped for coins at these ghats are addicted to drugs, Augustine, who considers Mother Teresa the ideal, understands them
" ve kehete hai, ''main dusron ke liye jeena chahta hum
 i think so much about something that goes crazy

 Augustine gets 10 from the river, sometimes 100

 Of these, what is left over after spending on food, they use it to help the sick-hungry people on the track
 vahiin bengal se aae do doston imam shaikh or gopal das kii kahani kuch alag he

 ausatan ek gotaakhor pratidin sau rupye nikaal letaa he, lekin laashon ke saath bahaae jane vaale sone-chaandi se inhen kaaphi paise mil jate hai
 Although most divers spend these rupees on drugs
 sadak par bane footpath yaa fliover ke neeche kaa hissaa hi inke sone kaa thikaana hota he
 These people do not consider the water of Yamuna as dirty, but call it the mother of life
 inaki jindagi par documentry film banane vaale akaash arun kehete hai, ''in gotakhoron kii jindagi mere yakeen kii hadon se pare thi
 There is also a section in this Delhi that considers Yamuna as the mother of the mother and blesses those who throw coins in the name of faith
 ''yamuna ke sahare jindagi khinch rahe har gotaakhor kii kahani ek majaburi ko bayaan karti he
 The government and institutions receiving billions of foreign aid in the name of Yamuna may not be worried about the elderly like Sangma who are waiting for the death of these innocent children with the dead dreams or pain of life

 Darul Uloom Deoband, an organization that resolves public doubts about Islamic rules, has been in the news of various fatwas related to life this year
 devband ne jahaan raktadan ko haraam qaraar de diya, vahiin mahilaon or purushon ke ek saath kaam karne ko bhi avaidh bataaya
 Deoband said in one of his edicts that according to Islam, only the husband has the right to divorce and even if the wife divorces, it is not valid
 ek vyakti ne devband se poocha tha, ‘meri patni ne mujhase teen baar talaak kaha, lekin ham ab bhi saath rah rahe hai, kya hamaari shaadi jaij he?’ is par devband ne kaha ki keval pati kii ore se diya talaak hi jaij he or patni ko talaak dene kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Apart from this, Deoband also said in one fatwa that if the husband divorces his wife over phone, then it is also valid in the same way as given
 devband ne angadaan or raktadan ko bhi islam ke mutabik haraam qaraar de diya
 Deoband was asked whether donating blood is right or wrong according to Islam? In response, Deoband said, 'we are not the owners of our own body parts, who can use the organs arbitrarily, so donating blood or donating organs is illegal
 haalanki agar kisi najdiki sambandhi kaa jivan bachaane ke liye aap raktadan karen, to isaki anumati he
 Islamic scholars also opposed this edict of Deoband and appealed to the members of his community to donate more and more blood and organs
 samudaay kii mahilaon ke bare main bhi is baar kai fatve aae
 One fatwa said that according to Islam, women are forbidden to wear 'skin tight' clothes and girls' dress should be loose and simple
 vahiin garbhanirodhakon ke istemaal par bhi devband ne ek fatwa jari kar sansani failaa di
 a man asked Deoband that his wife had a thyroid problem, due to which her pregnancy could affect the child
 aisi sthiti se bachane ke liye use chikitsak ne garbhanirodhak ke istemaal kii salaah di he or kya vah islam ke mutabik garbhanirodhak kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 In response, Deoband said that he should consult Hakim about this after consulting the doctor and if he too advises her to use contraception, he can do so
 devband ne mahilaon ko kaaji yaa nyaayadhish banane ko bhi lagbhag haraam qaraar de diya
 Deoband gave a fatwa in response to a question about this, saying that women can be made judges, but it is almost harmless and if they do not do so, it is better
 devband ne kaha ki yah haddees main bhi diya gaya he, jiskaa matlab he ki jo desh ek mahila ko apana shaasha banayega, vah kabhi safal nahin hoga, isliye mahilaon ko nyaayadhish nahin banaaya janaa chahie
 In the same year, Deoband also said that working with the men of women is also forbidden
 devband ne aise sabhi sthanon par mahilaon ke kaam karne ko galat bataaya, jahaan ve purushon se bina burke ke swachhandata se baatcheet karti hon

 barish ke saath hi dengue kaa dank dhire dhire rajdhani main apane pair pasaar rahaa he
 The Delhi government has issued strict guidelines to all hospitals for screening and treatment of dengue after the first death of the season from dengue
 'aaj tak' ne dilli sarkaar ke aspataalon kii taiyaariyon kaa jayja liya
 We investigated the arrangements for reserve beds and fever clinics for dengue in three major government hospitals
 haalanki abhi dengue ke maamle bahut kam hai, lekin pichley saal kii tarah agar dengue ke marijon kii taadaad badhati he to kya sarkari aspataalon main wo injataam hai, jiskaa daawa sarkaar kar rahi he
 To know this, we reached three big hospitals in the capital
 alengepi or jitibi jaise bade aspataalon main nahin dikhaa dengue ke dank se ladane kaa khaas intjamdilli sarkaar ke daavon kii padtaal karne ham dilli ke alag-alag sarkari aspataalon main pahunche
 First of all, we moved to the largest government hospitals in the capital
 naam he lok nayak jai prakaash aspataal
 The team of 'aaj Tak' went to different wards of this hospital
 hamane dengue ke liye banaae gaye khaas ward kaa jayja lenaa chaha, lekin alengepi aspataal main hamen kahin koidengue ward yaa fever clinics naheendikhai diya
 In ward 31 and 32, fever victims were being shifted
 aspataal kii nurse se baat karne par pataa chalaa ki dengue ke liye koi ward abhi nahin banaaya gaya he
 According to LNJP Hospital's Additional Medical Superintendent Sunil Kumar, 'the hospital has about 300 beds for fever and dengue patients
 lekin philhal in sabhi beads ko kisi naa kisi zaruratmand marij ko de diya gaya he
 So far, only 2 case positives have been found in LNJP hospital, which have also been discharged after treatment
 lihaaja jaise-jaise maamle saamne aaenge, beads or fever clinics ke liye vishesh intjaam kar diya jayega
 'something similar was happening at GTB Hospital in Dilshad Garden, East Delhi
 dengue se nipatane ke liye jo aadesh dilli sarkaar ne die hai, uski koi khaas taiyaari nahin dikhi
 Hospital medical director Sunil Kumar argues that currently there are fewer dengue cases this year than last year, but despite this, the 200-bed dengue ward in GTB Hospital is different, keeping in mind the government's directives
 jab 'aaj tak' kii team ne 200 bistar vaala dengue ward talashne kii koshish kii to har ward main sirf marij hi marij najar aae
 We did not see any special dengue ward
 haalanki aspataal main 15 se 20 bistar kaa ek fever clinics hi najar aayaa or usamen bhi marij najar aae
 Significantly, 29 cases of dengue have been reported in GTB hospital since April
 matlab saaf he ki sarkari aspataalon main pehle se hi beads kii kami he aise main 10 se 20 fisadi beads dengue yaa fever ke marijon ke liye rigerv rakhana aspataalon ke liye ek badi chunauti he
 The situation at Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital was better than the LNJP Hospital at Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital in East Delhi
 elbs ke duusari manzil par ek vishesh dengue ward taiyaar he
 There are currently 9 patients in this 12-bed ward, who are suffering from fever or suspected dengue
 laal bahadur shastri aspataal ke nodel officer dow yogesh kushvaha ne bataaya ki july ke maheene main dengue ke kareeb 14 maamle positive paae gaye
 However, all of them were discharged after treatment
 dow
 According to Yogesh, a separate fever clinic will be opened as soon as necessary to deal with Mendengue in the hospital, in which only fever patients will be screened
 kyonki philhal maamle kam hai isliye abhi alag fever clinics kii vyavastha nahin kii gai he
 All the facilities from platelet count to ELIZA test are available in the hospital
 haalanki marij badhane kii sthiti main paramedical staff or doctoron kii kami ho jaati he, lekin iske liye sarkaar outsorcing kar mainpavar muhaiyaa karaati he
 At present, there is not much dengue cases
 dilli sarkaar kaa daawa- dengue se nipatane kii taiyaari puridelli ke aspataalon mesub tak dengue ke 119 maamle saamne chuke hai
 In the last one week, 29 new cases of dengue have been registered
 lihaaja sarkaar ne dengue se nipatane ke liye khud ehtiyaat ke taur par dilli sarkaar ne sabhi aspataalon or nursing homes ko agle teen maheene ke liye dengue ke marijon ke liye 10 se 20 fisadi atirikt bed kaa intjaam karne ko kaha he
 These extra beds will only be used for dengue or fever patients
 300 se zyada fever clinics ke saath mohlla clinics ko bhi dengue ke marijon ke ilaaj ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Health Minister Satyendar Jain of Delhi Government says that the government is fully prepared to deal with dengue
 sabhi sarkari aspataalon main nodel officer kii niyukti kii gai he
 The platelets test for dengue patients has been fixed at Rs 50 and ELIZA ie dengue test at Rs 600
 agar koi aspataal yaa lab test ke liye marijon se zyada charge karte paae gaye to shikaayat milane par un par sakht karrwai hogi
 Today Mahatma Gandhi's birthday is being celebrated all over the world
 aaj hi ke din 1869 main mahatma gandhi kaa janm gujarat ke porbandar main hua tha
 We all know that Mahatma Gandhi had shaken the world not only in the country but with his non-violent movements
 pehle dakshin africa or baad main desh main angrejon ke khilaaf unhone morcha khol diya lekin yah bhi ek sachai he ki jab azaadi mulk ke muhane par khadi thi to mahatma apano ke bich hi begaane ho rahe the
 He was saddened by the communal violence spread across the country and was fasting for peace restoration in both communities
 jab desh aazaadee kii khushi manaa rahaa tha to gandhi ek mahatma or sadhu kii tarah dilli se dur kalakatta main anshan kar rahe the or bhukhe the
 Let us know on this occasion what the worshipers of non-violence and the main heroes of the battle of Ajadi were doing on the first morning of independence and one night before that
 mahatma gandhi is desh ko aaazaad karwaane ke liye ladi jane vaali jis ladaai kaa netritv kiya tha uskaa ant 15 agast 1947 ko hua

 There was a happy atmosphere all around but Mahatma Gandhi was away from all of these in Calcutta and was in agony due to the partition of the country with independence and the hindu-muslim riots due to this

 Shortly before independence, their differences with Nehru had come to the fore
 nehru unki sun nahin rahe the
 The great socialist leader Dr

 In the book, Lohia describes in detail the meeting of the Congress Working Committee which approved the partition plan of the country
 lohia ke mutabik is baithak main gandhi ne nehru or patel se shikayati lahaze main kaha tha ki unhen bantwaare ke bare main sahi jaankaree nahin di gai
 In response, Nehru cut the talk of Mahatma Gandhi by saying that he had given him equal information
 lohia likhte hai, 'gandhi ne halki shikaayat kii mudra main shri nehru or sardaar patel se kaha tha ki unhen bantwaare ke bare main soochna nahin di gai or iske pehle ki gandhi ji apni baat puri kah pate, shri nehru ne tanik aavesh main aakar bich main unhen tokaa or kaha ki unako wo puri jaankaree baraabar dete rahe'

 However Prime Minister Narendra Modi first tweeted for Naveen Patnaik
 unhone likhaa, ‘naveen babu, aapako ek or jeet ke liye badhai
 Congratulations on your coming term '
 narendra modi ke is twit ke saath kai sanket mil rahe hai
 Actually, before the election there were indications that both Jagan and Naveen have a soft attitude towards NDA
 kyonki donon hi dalon ne chunaav se pehle kisi dal kaa samarthan nahin kiya tha or elaan kiya tha ki jo bhi party sarkaar banane ke haq main hogi, ham uskaa saath denge
 There are indications as to whether the two parties will join the NDA after forming the government

 Odisha's experience shows that Naveen Patnaik's strong Chief Minister's image was countered by Narendra Modi's strong image as Prime Minister

 ’’ Announcing Balakrishnan's withdrawal from the company's board and service on 20 December, Infosys had said that the resignation was effective from 31 December 2013

 When asked if he was looking at a political career with his business commitment, he said, "I think in the future i will be able to handle both
" ’’ When asked about contesting the Lok Sabha elections, he said, "it is too early to say anything about this at the moment
" ’’ The meeting of Sangh and BJP leaders has started in Delhi on Tuesday
 baithak ke liye sangh ke saare bade netaa dilli main maujuud hai
 However Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat has not arrived to attend this meeting
 sangh kii ore se baithak main bhaiyyaji joshi, dattatre hoshabhole or suresh soni maujuud hai
 LK Advani, Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh, Venkaiah Naidu and Ananth Kumar are present in the meeting on behalf of BJP
 rajnath singh ke bijepi adhyaksh banane ke baad sangh ke netaaon ke saath ye pehali baithak he, lihaaja mana ja rahaa he ki baithak main rajnath kii nai team par maathapai ho sakati he

 The country has entered the Lok Sabha elections
 isi ke saath partiyaan or uske netaaon ne ek-duusare ke vaade-iraade kaa postmortem karnaa shuru kar diya he
 In this, the issue of sugarcane farmers is also bouncing, as is the case in every election
 ravivaar ko congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ko achaanak ganna kisaanon kii yaad ai or unhone twit kiya ki maujuuda yogi sarkaar ko inaki koi phikr nahin
 He alleged that UP is standing at the mouth of the election and farmers are staring for the arrears of Rs 10,000 crore
 chunaav na hota to ek baat thi lekin is najuk vakt main congress ke is aarope par bijepi kaise palatwaar na karti
 So, BJP immediately grabbed Priyanka Gandhi and reminded them of the bygone era
 khud mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne morcha sambhala or kaha ki 'hamaari sarkaar jab se satta main ai he, hamane lambit 57,800 karod kaa ganna bakaayaa bhugtan kiya he
 This amount is more than the budget of many states
 pichhali sapa-basapa sarkaron ne ganna kisaanon ke liye kuch nahin kiya jisase kisaan bhukhmaree kaa shikaar ho rahaa tha
 'but the question of the opposition leaders is that the CM of UP should have also told how much payment is yet to the sugarcane farmers
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii uparokt baaten sahi maan sakate hai ki unhone takreeban 58 hajaar karod rupye kisaanon ko die hai
 But how good it would be if they also told how much more arrears were yet to be given
 isse kahin na kahin andeh kii ek lakeer jarur khinchati he ki dene se zyada lene waalon kii fehrist lambii he, isliye sarkaar aankade dabaa rahi he
 If the election is on the forehead then the sugarcane farmers will definitely bring the government to the forehead, but one thing is certain that the matter of sugarcane farmers is not of recent years
 agar aisa hota to hajaaron karod rupye bakaaye kaa yah pahaad kaise khadaa hota
 Now that the election is on the head and Yogi Adityanath has the crown on his head, he will have to answer
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath jawaab bhi de rahe hai magar unke aankadon se vah sankhya gaayab he jiske intjaar main vipakshi dal baithe hai
 These parties demand that why the UP government does not tell how much is left to be given
 aise main kya yogi adityanath ko jatke main bataa dena chahie ki falaan-falaan kisaanon kaa itnaa rupaya bakaayaa he? mukhyamantri chaah kar bhi aisa nahin bataa paaenge kyonki bakaayaa kai saal se lataka he
 The governments which came, played according to their statistics and played with the figures, but no one has told how many farmers' money is left
 ise partiyon kii ek sochi samajhi ranneeti kaa hissaa maan sakate hai
 If the parties unravel the secret of arrears, it will reveal their incompetence and send an adverse message among the people
 yogi adityanath bhi isi ranneeti ke sahare hai or isi lakeer par aage bad rahe hai
 Then he hit back at Priyanka Gandhi and said that where were these 'so-called' benefactors of farmers when the farmer was on the verge of starvation from 2012 to 2017
 inaki neend ab kyon khuli he? pradesh kaa ganna kshetrafal ab 22 pratishat badhkar 28 lakh hectare hua he or band padi kai chini milon ko bhi pradesh main dobaaraa shuru kiya gaya he
 The farmers are happy now
 'mukhyamantri kii baton se saaf he ki upi ke kisaan ab zyada ganna bo rahe hai or isaki kheti main dilchaspee le rahe hai
 What does it mean that after the completion of the dues of the farmers, their interest in sugarcane cultivation has increased? It can be assumed that the policies of the present government and the will to take quick decisions have created a ray of hope among the sugarcane farmers and more and more farmers are placing bets on sugarcane but cannot link it with the payment of dues
 aisa kahana takneekee taur par galat hoga ki bakaayaa raashi chukaaye jane se kisaanon main josh he or ve teji se ganna kii kheti kar rahe hai jisase buaai ke rakabe main badhotaree hui he, jiskaa zikr yogi adityanath ravivaar ke ek bhaashan main kar rahe the
 The Chief Minister in his speech raised many other issues with focus on the farmer
 isliye ki bhartiya loktantr ke chunaav main kisaanon kaa mudda achaanak jaagta he or is mudde kaa sadupyog partiyaan bakhubi karti hai
 The ruling party and governments take care of the votes and also pay the dues
 yah raajnneeti kii jaani-pahachaani thiyari he
 There is also a theory of politics that the wives should be distributed to their loved ones and the ones left to be trusted by God
 isi reeti main ve kisaan maare jate hai jinka jhukaav vipakshi partiyon kii ore hota he
 In such a situation, why should the government mention the number of farmers and the arrears due to which their neck is stuck
 yogi adityanath ne dabe aankade bhale na bataae hon lekin itnaa jarur kah diya ki 'jinhone 5 saal main kul milakar 55,000 karod ganna bhugtan bhar kiya ve do saal main 57,800 karod bhugtan karne vaali hamaari sarkaar se jawaab kis munh se maang rahi hai? ganna kisaanon kii bhalaai ke liye mayawati ji ne kya kiya? apane kaarykaal main unhone 21 chini milon ko shadyantr ke tahat bech diya, jisaki abhi jaanch bhi chal rahi he
 Was it in the interest of the sugarcane farmers? ”now the public will decide whether Yogi Adityanath is right or whether Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati or Mulayam Singh were right
 bolne-kosne kaa yah silsilaa bhi jari rahegaa kyonki ganna kisaan tab bhi badahaal tha or aaj bhi he
 If this was not the case, why would there be politics on the stump of sugarcane? pakistan apni napak harkaton se baj nahin aa rahaa he

 america raashtrapati donald trampane 2 march ko twit kiya, ''vyapaarik jang mjedaar hoti hai or unhen aasaani se jeeta bhi ja saktaa he
 a day before that, the Trump administration announced a record duty of 25 per cent on steel imports and 10 per cent on aluminum imports, shocking the markets
 agle hi din unke twit ke baad landan se lekar beijing or dilli tak duniyabar kii rajdhaniyon main rajanyikon ke bich khalabali much gai
 Was this trump message just like the past, or was it just a sign of danger, or was it really a sign of the danger that countries like China and India had especially since the arrival of Trump, that is, the beginning of the global trade war? Which could have caused the globalization process a fatal loss? Before taking office, Trump had expressed reservations about 'unfair' trade deals, especially with China
 Ilaf
 unka kahana tha ki china ne america arthvyavastha or uski naukariyon ko khaasi chot pahunchaai he
 He promised to tear apart multi-level trade agreements when he came to power

 Trump's first actions after becoming president included signing the mandate under which the US was withdrawn from the trans-pacific Partnership (TPP)
 darasal tipipi ke samjhaute ko china ke badhate aarthik prabhutv kaa muqabla karne ke tod ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 Recently, Trump insisted on Twitter that America's annual trade deficit was $ 800 billion (rs 52 lakh crore last year)
 ) par pahunch gaya he
 The high rates of tariffs on industrial warfare of Andeshasteel and Aluminum have drawn strong condemnation from rivals such as China, apart from US allied countries — Canada, the European Union and Mexico
 agar trump in oonchi daron ke daayre kaa vistaar karte hai to isse vyapaarik yuddh chhidane kaa andeshaa najar aa rahaa he
 His administration has already indicated that he will be able to pay $ 60 billion annually (3) on Chinese exports to the US
 9 lakh karod ru
 ) Is considering levying a fee
 jaahir he ki china bhi javaabi kadam uthayega
 Chinese economists say that their country also has the power to respond to this
 vah krishi utpaadon se lekar hawaii jahaajon tak, arabon dollar mulya ke america aayaat main katautee kar saktaa he
 At the same time, it can impose a number of restrictions on all the American companies, from the auto makers to Apple and Starbucks depending on the Chinese market
 aakhir koi vyapaarik jang kisi najar aegi? pehle to america shulkon ko prabhavit paksh vishwa vyapaar sanghathan (dablutio) main chunauti denge
 The EU has already indicated that it is going to take such a step on US steel import tariffs
 dablutio main america ke khilaaf faisla hone ke asaar hai
 On the other hand, the EU will also take tit-for-tat action under retaliation, which will reduce the flow of world trade overall
 ye sari baaten dablutio ko lagaataar apraasangik bana sakati hai
 As a result, multilateral global trade will get a deeper push
 haalanki visheshgyon ko ummid he ki kisi nirnaayak jang kii naubat philhal nahin aane vaali he
 Especially if Trump trumps his footsteps, as he has always done, and makes a compromise that he can present as a moral victory among his supporters
 masalan ve america ke vyapaarik sahyogi deshon ko ye vaada karne ke liye taiyaar kar sakate hai ki ve apane trade sarplus ko kam karenge
 That is, they will reduce its increased exports compared to imports from the US
 beijing ko isi tarah kaa upaay nikalne kii ummid he
 "I don't think there's going to be a big business war," says economist Shu Bin at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai
 china kisi bhi haal main sidhe takaraav se bachegaa or vah niryaat ko kam karne or kam samvedansheel kshetron main zyada nivesh ke raste nikaalega
 Trump's first objective is to win the 2018 midterm elections and become president again in 2020
 unka janaadhar paaramparik menuphaccharing udyogon ke shramik varg main he or china unamem nivesh kaa vaada kar saktaa he

 Vishwajit Dhar, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, says, "trump is making his last attempt to please his voters
" '' haalanki yah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab haal-philhal america ne vyapaar ke mudde par bharat ko nishaanaa banane kii koshish kii he
 Urging India to raise the issue on international forums, Dhar says, "in 2014, the US International Trade Commission began an investigation into India's trade and investment policy to find out how it would hurt American interests
" Has been lekin bharat ko is tarah kii harkaton se dabana nahin chahie
 In future, the US may also raise some intellectual property rights issues

 Indian steel companies can find an alternative market for this modest US steel export without any difficulty
 '' ikra kaa maananaa he ki steel par aayaat shulk lagane kaa madhyavadhi main khaas prabhaav nahin padegaa or isaki teen vajahen hai—pehali, 2018 main america ko chhodkar baaki vaishvik steel maang main 2
 An increase of 5 million tonnes is expected and obviously the amount affected by US tariffs can be offset in other areas, especially in emerging / developing economies
 duusari baat, china ke steel niryaat main lagaataar giravat aa rahi he or vah 2015 main 11
 7 in 2017, down from 20 million tonnes
 5 karod ton rah gaya
 The decline is likely to continue in 2018 as well, due to a surge in domestic demand and proposed reductions in steel production capacities
 is vajah se (bharat sareekhe) baaki steel niryaatak desh china ke kaaran paidaa hone vaali riktata kii bharpai karne ke liye america ko ho rahe niryaat ko duusari taraf mode sakate hai
 Thirdly, in 2017, domestic steel companies in the US were producing at 74 per cent capacity
 agar 2018 main kshamta ke istemaal main ullekhneey sudhaar bhi hota he to bhi use gaiyr-chhot praapt deshon se 1 karod ton steel aayaat kii jarurat hogi
 Our policy-makers should be inspired by what @POTUS (US President's official Twitter account) has done
 steel ko sabhi pat (mukt vyapaar samjhauton) se baahar rakhaa janaa chahie
 Jindal's tweet was aimed at China, which has 15 per cent more production and is using it to "impede the steel industry by dumping substandard steel around the world
" ''visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki aluminium par lagaaya gaya america shulk bhi vaishvik aluminium udyog par koi khaas asar nahin daal paaegaa
 The US has complained to the WTO against India's export subsidy programs
 isamen bharat se vyapaarik niryaat yojana, niryatonmukhi ikai yojana, electronics hardware technology park skim, vishesh niryaat kshetra, niryaat sanvadrdhan puunjigat saamaan yojana, or niryaatkon ke liye shulk-mukt aayaat kaarykram shaamil hai
 The US says that these incentives violate WTO agreements because India is no longer below the economic level of per capita gross national income of $ 1,000
 sabsidi ke mulya ko 7 arab dollar (45,500 karod ru
 ) US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer says, "export subsidy programs harm American workers by creating a non-equal ground for competition
" ''bharat ne is daleel kaa virodh kiya he
 According to media reports, Commerce Secretary Rita Tewatia says, "such remarks are irresponsible
" 
 
 kyonki ham ek-duusare ko bechney main hi ruchi rakhte hai
 She further states that India will not take any hasty step
 unke shabdon main, ''ham unase sakriy samvaad rakhenge
 “india has eight years to come out of the subsidy regime
 tevatiya kahati hai, ''hamen ummid he ki ve is samyavadhi ko samajhenge or ham bhi is dauraan daayitv puraa karne kii patibaddhta dikhaaenge
 "trump has also been repeatedly raising the issue of high import tariffs (hundred per cent, which was later reduced to half) on Harley Davidson motorcycles in India

 Dhar says that even if Indian exporters face a challenge in the US markets, they are able to identify new markets
 udyog sanstha asocham kaa kahana he ki niryaat se zyada aayaat bharat ko jawaab dene ke liye zyada gunjaaish nahin chodenge, kyonki uske zyaadaatar aayaat aprihaary hai
 Assocham said in a statement, "the best way is to maintain a constant dialogue with the major trading partners and not to show yourself as more connected to one group

 Most of China's trade initiatives at Pahootrump are ultimately aimed at China, its largest trading partner, although its levies on steel and aluminum will not have a significant impact on Beijing
 darasal, china main to america kii ore se kii gai steel aayaat shulkon kii ghoshnaa ko bade pahelinuma andaaj main dekha gaya kyonki uskaa asar america ke saathi deshon par zyada padana tha
 China's share of US steel imports has been steadily decreasing and is now less than 4 percent, compared to the European Union (21 percent), Canada (17 percent), South Korea (9 percent), Brazil (8 percent), Mexico (8%) and Japan (5%) share more
 arthshaastri shu bin kaa kahana he ki ''steel par shulk japan, germany or dakshin korea jaise deshon ko zyada nuksaan pahunchaayenge
 But China is more worried that the trumps will not stop on steel only and they are using steel only to sense the wind
 ''washington se milane vaali reporton ke anusaar, vyapaarik jang to tab chhidegi agar trump china ke pramukh niryaaton ko nishaanaa banaate hue salanaa 60 arab dollar tak ke shulk laga dete hai
 Two-way trade in goods and services in 2016 was $ 648 billion (42

 On the other hand, the possibility of a fee of $ 60 billion is not easily taken by American companies
 america chambers of commers ke president thomas je
 Donohue said, "the administration is correct in focusing on China's industrial policies and the negative economic impact of unfair trade antics, but the US Chamber will oppose any move to impose heavy duties
" shulk america upabhoktaaon ke liye hi nuksandaayak hai
 Applying a $ 30 billion fee annually would clear nearly one-third of all the savings that American families received from doubling the standard deduction in tax reforms
 or jaisi ki afvaahen hai, agar shulk 60 arab dollar tak pahunch gaye tab to uske kaaphi vinaashkari nattejey honge
 This could result in a deep trade war that has to bear the brunt of US growth and job creation
 ''beijing aise kisi shulk ko rokane kii koshish kar rahaa he or ek samjhaute kii taraf badaae ke sanket de rahaa he
 In response, it may impose duties on some major US imports that can be obtained from elsewhere

 Economist Li Wei of the Chung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing says, "the more the duty on an electric appliance will harm China, the more it will hurt Apple
" bhumandalikrut duniya main vrihad nattejey jhele bina aap ek desh ko nishaanaa nahin bana sakate
 "how can China answer?" On this question, Li says that Beijing's response will be dual — first through the WTO and second by maintaining a common interest with countries like Germany and India
 is mudde par america kahin zyada alag-thalag pad jayega
 "the system that Trump is trying to defy was established by America itself after the second world war," says Lee
 ''philhal saare desh trump ke kadamon par ek mail-milaap vaala hi rukh dikhaa rahe hai, lekin bharat jaise deshon ko bhi sabsidi yojanaon ke aaropon par ek majboot jawaab to taiyaar karnaa hi hoga or unhen upyukt manch par uthaanaa hoga
 Otherwise, similar trade issues will continue to be raised again and again and will hurt economies that are trying to reinvigorate themselves through high exports
