 dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne sarkari paise ko kaise self pramotion ke liye kharch kiya he, iskaa khulaasa 'aaj tak' ne kiya
 Not only has government money been shed like water for self-promotion, but for political gains, the states where elections are to be held recently and the Aam Aadmi Party are preparing to contest there
 'aaj tak' ke paas aise sarkari dastavej maujuud hai, jinase khulaasa hua he ki kaise janata se judane ke bahaane kejariwal sarkaar ne apane raajnneetik hit saadhane kii koshish kii he

 According to government documents, what has been revealed is shocking, because it clearly states that the focus of the Talk to AK event should be placed in Goa, Gujarat and Punjab besides Delhi
 in rajyon ke 18 saal se zyada umr ke logon ke bich tok tu eke ko papularise kiya jaae
 These are the same states where elections are to be held in the coming months and the Aam Aadmi Party is preparing for these elections with complete preparation

 fasebuk campan ko dilli ke alaava punjab, goa or gujarat main laanch karne kii baat likhi gai he, jabaki post event campan ko google, utyub or fasebuk ke jariye deshbhar main prachaarit karne kii baat kahi gai
 According to the note, PR agency Perfect Relations was asked by the Deputy CM to immediately start a campaign to make the Talk to AK event popular in digital media
 saath hi piaar agency ne is puure campan ke kharch kii laagat ek karod aththavan lakh 75 hajaar rupye tay kii thi
 However, this cost was later reduced to one crore five lakh rupees
 chunaav vaale rajyon ko plan main shaamil kiya gayiib jaraa is puure campan plan kaa majamoon jaan lijie
 In which it is clear that the purpose of the event was not just to communicate to the people of Delhi, but the target was the states where the political ambitions of the Aam Aadmi Party are filling up

 Without naming Katju, Nitish Kumar said that he is talking about giving Bihar along with Kashmir, he seems to own Bihar
 bataaie aise-aise bhi log hai is sansar main, tarah-tarah kii baat karte rahete hai
 On Katju's post, BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said that Nitish Kumar can give the exact answer on Katju's post, because the same two months ago, Katju was making Nitish Kumar the Prime Minister and Arvind Kejriwal as Deputy Prime Minister
 patna ke ek kaarykram main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne justisakatju ke postepper talkh tippanee karte hue kaha ki bihar kaa gauravshaalee itihaas rahaa he
 Referring to the glorious history of Bihar, Nitish Kumar said that this is Bihar, this is Patna, this is Pataliputra, from where such a large area was ruled, in such a large area that India is not even today
 nitish kumaar ne talkh tevar main kaha ki isi bihar main buddha ko gyaan kii prapti hui, isi bihar main bhagwaan mahavir kaa janm hua, chanakya ne arthshaastra kii rachana isi bihar main kii, chandragupta or samraat ashok kii dharti rahi he bihar

 Nitish Kumar said that when alcohol-free Bihar, open defecation-free environment, electricity in every house, village and paved road in every lane of the city, along with the implementation of the seven decisions of the government, Bihar will go to such high heights that you Can say Sky is the limit
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki bihar smart city kab banegaa ye mujhe nahin pataa lekin saat nishchay ke kriyanvayan ke baad bihar ke log zarur smart ho jaaenge
 On the controversial post of Justice Katju, BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said that the same Katju was making Nitish Kumar the Prime Minister of the country and Arvind Kejriwal as the Deputy Prime Minister two months ago, then JDU people were praising Katju very much at that time
 aisi sthiti main katju ke is bayaan kaa sahi dhang se jawaab jediu ke log hi de sakate hai
 BJP did not take Katju seriously even before and even today is not taking it seriously
 susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki katju ke fasebuk post par nitish kumaar ko jawaab dena chahie
 The question here is not about BJP and JDU, it is the question of Bihar's identity, there is no need to link this statement with previous statements
 lekin yahaan bhi raajnneeti shuru he
 Sushil Modi said that he does not take seriously his statements but the people of Bihar are not going to forget
 katju ne yah bayaan dekar bihar ke saath bahut bhadda majaak kiya he
 An FIR has been registered against Justice Katju at Shastrinagar police station in Patna in the case of controversial post
 bihar or kashmir ke bare main aapattijanak tippanee soshal media par karne ke aarope main ye exiaar janata dal you ke pravaktaa or emelsi niraj kumaar ne darj karaayaa he
 Neeraj Kumar has also sent a copy of Facebook in which Katju has written - If Pakistan wants Kashmir, we are ready to give it, provided it is ready to take Bihar along with Kashmir
 niraj kumaar ne exiaar main kaha he ki yah kashmir evam bihar ke prati ghrinaa failaane vaali rashtriya ekta ko kamjor karne vaali bhashaa he

 duniya kii badi tech company google auto company ford ke saath milakar self driven car bana sakati he
 According to the news, if the deal is final, it can be officially announced during the annual International Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas

 Earlier this year, Google was in talks with the world's largest automakers to bring self-driving cars to market by 2020

 Apart from this, Tesla and some other companies have also announced to bring self-driving cars
 haalanki ford ne abhi tak yah saaf nahin kiya he ki wo kab self driving car develop karnaa shuru karegi
 Experts believe that Ford will form a new company, partnering with tech company Google to make self-driving cars, not by itself
 rajasthan kii raajnneeti main jaateey varchasv ko todate hue sheersh par pahunchane vaale netaaon main yadi kisi kaa naam sabase aage aata he to wo ashok gahalot hai
 Gehlot, a two-time chief minister of the state, comes from the Mali community
 inkaa parivaar kisi jamaane main jaaduugari kaa kartab dikhaata tha
 As in-charge of Gujarat, he brought the young trio of hardik-alpesh-jignesh along with the Congress and brought the party to the threshold of victory and to date, Gehlot, the general secretary of the organization, is the closest to the president Rahul Gandhi under the central leadership of the party
 Huh
 indira kii padi najar, sanjay ne dilaai pahachaatshok gahalotako 70 ke dashak main congress main shaamil hone kaa mauka mila tha, jab purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke samay party main sanjay gandhi kii chalati thi
 When Sanjay Gandhi's close acquaintances told him about Ashok Gehlot, he made Gehlot the president of the party's student organization NSUI in Rajasthan
 gahalot ko shuruaati dinon main sanjay gandhi kii mandali ke log 'gili billy' kahkar sambodhit karte the
 Today, people do not know much about this powerful leader in Rahul Gandhi's Congress rather than that his father Babu Lakshman Singh Daksha was a famous magician
 bachapan ke dinon main gahalot bhi apane pita ke sahaayak ke taur par desh bhar main unke kartab kaa hissaa hua karte the
 Some people believe that Ashoka Gehlot was first noticed by Indira Gandhi herself
 jab purvi pakistan (ab bangladesh) main vidroh ke baad purvottar main sharnaarthi sankat khadaa ho gaya tha
 Gehlot was 20 years old at the time, and Indira invited him to join politics
 jiske baad gahalot ne akhil bhartiya congress cameti ke indore sammelan main hissaa liya or yaheen unki mulaakaat sanjay gandhi se hui
 a period of expansion of the Youth Congress, which many strong leaders gave to the Indore Conference of Congress, the late leader Priyaranjan Dasmunsi was elected President of the Youth Congress
 yah wo samay tha jab indira or sanjay gandhi yuva congress ko dakshin panthi jansangh or uske sahyogi sanghathan se mukaable ke liye taiyaar karnaa chaahate the
 Experts believe that this period in the Congress was the golden period of the rise of the youth leadership
 is dauraan party ko kai ahm netaa mili jisameshok gahalot, kamalnath, digvijay singh, ambika soni, vylar ravi, eke antni, gulam nabi aaazaad or bike hariprasad shaamil hai
 All these leaders hold great position in today's Congress
 apane swabhaav or saadhaaran prishthbhumi ke anuroop ashok gahalot rajasthan main lo profile rahete hue kaam karte rahe
 But when Rajiv Gandhi got an important role in the party after the death of Sanjay Gandhi in a plane crash, he recommended Gehlot's name as Minister of State in Indira Gandhi's cabinet
 is dauraan rajasthan main congress ke do bade netaa purv mukhyamantri haridev joshi or shivacharan maathur kaa bolbalaa tha
 But Gehlot had the trust of Rajiv Gandhi
 wo ghatana jisane gahalot kaa rasta saaf kiyaek mashhoor vakya he jab rajasthan bheeshan sookhe se jujh rahaa tha or purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne dilli se 170 kimi dur sariska neshnal park main cabinet kii baithak bulaai thi
 In this meeting, Rajiv had instructed all the ministers of the state to come by their car instead of government vehicles and Rajiv himself was driving a private car
 tabhi ek trephic consteble ne rajeev kii car ko sidhe jane kaa signal dene ke bajaay daahine mudane ke liye kaha
 The result of this mistake by the constable proved costly for Haridev Joshi, because of the diversion, Rajiv reached the place where the ministers' official vehicles were parked
 darasal rajeev iske jariye party or sarkaar main mitvyayita kaa sandesh dena chaah rahe the
 Joshi did not attend the lunch due to Rajiv Gandhi's displeasure, in the absence of host Joshi, his friend and HRD minister PV Narasimha Rao at the Center tried unsuccessfully to cool the case
 or is ghatana ke ek maheene baad haridev joshi ko badalakar shivacharan maathur ko rajasthan kaa mukhyamantri bana diya gaya
 Even though Joshi has returned again after almost two years, after that the Congress high command has not been able to beat him
 centre main bhi chodi amit chhapis dauraan gahalot centre sarkaar main paryaton mantri kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe the
 The credit for the construction of the Delhi Haat just opposite the INA Market in the national capital goes to Gehlot, who worked to deliver the products of artisans, artisans and artisans from all over the country directly to the customers without any middlemen
 rajeev se gahalot kii najdiki ne sonia gandhi or uske baad rahul gandhi kii adhyakshata vaali congress main unki bhoomika kam nahin hone di
 The BJP lost the 1998 assembly elections and Ashok Gehlot was made the chief minister after Bhairon Singh Shekhawat
 gahalot is samay vidhayak nahin the, lihaaja jodhpur ke sardarpura vidhansabha se vidhayak maansingh devda ne unke liye seat khaali kar di
 After this, Gehlot has been an MLA from this seat continuously since the victory in the by-elections
 jaaton kaa congress se mohabhangajankaron kii maane to mali samudaay se aane vaale ashok gahalot ke mukhyamantri banane par congress ko rajasthan main apane paaramparik jat vot kaa nuksaan hua
 The Jats, who are strongly opposed to the Rajputs, play a crucial role in 60-70 seats in Rajasthan
 rajya main pehle vidhansabha chunaav se hi jaaton kaa jhukaav congress kii taraf rahaa kyonki congress ne rajshahi khatm kii
 Major Jat leaders of the Congress Ramnivas Mirdha, Nathuram Mirdha, Parasaram Maderna had a strong influence in Marwar
 in netaaon ne immergency ke baad bhi jab congress kaa uttar bharat se safaya ho gaya tha tab congress kaa yah kila dhahne nahin diya
 For a long time, the leaders of this community look forward to becoming the Chief Minister for their loyalty
 lekin 1998 main ashok gahalot ke siem banane ke baad inkaa moh bhang hota chalaa gaya
 Gehlot Ashok Gehlot's simplicity and simplicity still carry him high in politics
 ek samay tha jab dilli ke bade netaa ahamed patel or gulam nabi aaazaad ke saamne gahalot ko jagah nahin milti thi or aaj ve inke barabari main khadey hai
 Talking about Rajasthan, Gehlot is keeping a good balance with the young leader Sachin Pilot sent by the likes of Rahul and so far there have been no reports of any differences between the two
 rahul lagaataar is baat kya dhyaan rakh rahe hai ki gahalot, payalat ke raste main na aaen or payalat bhi unki varishthata kaa sammaan rakhen
 Sachin Pilot is being seen as the next Chief Minister this time when the Congress forms the government in Rajasthan, while there is no dearth of those who believe that Gehlot will be Rahul's first choice if the Congress wins the state with a small margin

 ek saadhaaran-se gharelu shauk ko bade kaarobaar main kis tarah badla ja saktaa he, isaki misaal indore kii ek mahila ne pesh kii he
 ENT Surgeon Dr
 sunil sethi 21 saal pehle indore se england ke bamgham ja based the
 There he had neither an acquaintance nor a friend nor any relative
 aise main unki 45 varshiya patni poornima sethi ke liye khaali vakt kaatna mushkil tha
 So, he decided to go to Europe's well-known antique shops and collect personal collections
 isi shauk ke bal par aaj ve namchin kalatmak bazaar kii jaani-maani vyavsaayee hai
 His company Inter Arts, formed 10 years ago, has an annual turnover of Rs 1 crore today
 tak ja pahunchaa he
 Inter Arts offers antique and commercial products of famous companies worldwide making lifestyle products in India
 poornima bataati hai, ‘’bharat se aane vaale log mere collection kii tarif karte or aisa hi pis kharidne ke liye mujhase kehete
 Sometimes people have to give their collection to make close people happy
 jab yah silsilaa badhata chalaa gaya to dow
 Sethi advised me to get into the business of this
 ’’inter arts jaani-maani companiyon ke victorian quins collection, prasidgh paintings ke chaape vaali pyaaliyaan or chini ke martabaan bharat main uplabdh karvaa rahi he
 His collection Rs 650
 se shuru hokar 6,50,000 ru
 And includes everything from dinner sets to tea sets, crystal decorative items, sculptures, photoframes, flower pots, watches, lamps, as homeware
 poornima saaf kahati hai ki unka collection aam logon ke liye nahin he
 His customers are people who are fond of collecting antique and artistic things and who are also capable of spending
 poornima ne pichley chaar saal se bharat ke kuch mahanagaron main pradarshnee lagaani shuru kii, jiskaa unhen badhibia rispance mila he

 She performs in hotels like Taj and Oberoi
 apni kharid kshamta badaae se madhyam varg bhi ab poornima ke graahakon main shaamil ho gaya he
 She says, "there has been a tremendous change in India in the last 10 years
 mumbai ke taj main meraa pehla sho hua tha, jisamen gine-chune graahak hi aae the
 But now it is not so
 kharidaaron main madhyam varg kii sankhya badi he
 The grand weddings in India have also created new possibilities in the European lifestyle market
 jaisaa ki poornima bataati hai, ‘’bharatiyon main royal dalton ke wedding collection kii demand he
 When parents give home furnishings to the daughter in marriage, their first choice is Royal Doulton and Wedgwood Company
 ye kalatmak chini utpaada banane vaali jaani-maani companiyaan hai jinke product kii keemat 15,000 ru
 One lakh to Rs
 tak he
 "pull Pottery's products, which are recognized for the best vases and lamps in the world, are also in great demand among Indian customers
" lekin in mahange products kii khaasiyat kya he? poornima vejawood ke mitti ke bartan par kii gai baarik nakkashi dikhaate hue kahati hai, ‘’aisa kaam antarrashtriya bazaar main bahut myne rakhata he
 This is a unique example of imagination
 ’’ ve england kii mashhoor kalakaar aamanda bristben ke banaae glass ke ganesh dikhaate hue kahati hai ki yah murti kalatmak bazaar kii ekmaatr aisi kriti he jo bagaiyr saanche ke bani he
 According to Purnima, there is also a demand in the Indian market for works that have been signed by renowned sculptors such as Richard Golding and Will Shakespeare
 inter arts bharatiyon ko europea kala bazaar se to parichit karwaati hi he, europe ke log bhi is company ke jariye bhartiya kalakaaron kii kalakritiyaan kharidte hai
 But today, when the number of Indians going abroad is increasing, in such a situation, they can buy their own thing
 phir inter arts kii kya jarurat he? is par poornima kahati hai, ’’ham dheron vikalpon main se chuninda chijen laate hai
 Indians who come for a walk do not have that much time
 vaise bhi ham in kalakritiyon ko air cargo yaa ship ke jariye bahut sambhalakar laate hai
 "industrialists Vijay Parekh and Premlata Parekh of Indore have been shopping with Inter Arts for the last eight years
 Their products are convincing
 paarekh yaad karte hai ki beti kii shaadi main unhone jo videshi gift mehmaanon ko die the, unki kitni vaahvahee hui thi
 He says, "home ware for daughter was bought from Purnima
 baratiyon ko jo gift set diya tha vah england kii royal dalton company kaa tha
 It had a clock and a coffee mug, with a beautiful painting on it
 yuaantic ke shaukeenon ke liye inkaa mahangaa hona khaas myne nahin rakhata
 As Vijay Parekh says, "I have a special lamp

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Finance Minister p Chidambaram said on Wednesday that the Service Tax Voluntary Compliance Incentive Scheme (VCES) is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity as such offers are unlikely to come back in the next 20 years
 iske saath hi unhone kar chori karne waalon ko aagaah kiya he ki antat: unhen pahchaan kar, un tak pahunchaa jayega
 He said, the countdown has started and the last date is December 31
 sarkaar ne uchit va udaar peshkash kii he, aisi peshkash jo kam se kam agle kuch dashak main to aapako phir milane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Therefore it is in everyone's interest to take advantage of this offering
 visiies kii shuruyaat 10 may ko hui thi
 Under this, service tax arrears for the period from October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012 can be paid without interest and penalty
 chidambaram ne bangalore main visiies par vyapaar va udyog jagat ke pratinidhiyon kii baithak main kaha, pichhali chhot yojana 1997 main vidiaies ke naam se ai thi
 After 16 years, we have started such a scheme for service tax
 unhone kaha, agar koi yah maanata he ki ek or yojana agle saal aa rahi he, mujhe bhay he ki vah galat he
 These schemes cannot be declared every year
 hamen is tarah kii yojanaon ke liye paryaapt achche kaaran chahie
 Later in a similar meeting in Hyderabad, he said, if you think that a plan will come back next year or come in 2015, then you are wrong
 unhone kaha- is tarah kii yojanaon kii ghoshnaa har saal nahin kii sakati
 a Supreme Court judgment about the Voluntary Income Proclamation Scheme (VDIS) has tied our hands
 chidambaram ne kaha, isi kaaran hamen is yojana main sanshodhan karnaa padaa taaki yah ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirdesh kaa ulanghan nahin ho
 This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and certainly will not be available in the next 20 years

 isse pehle kendriya bank ne sone ke bhandar main ijapha november 2009 main kiya tha
 The purchase of RBI was done as part of the International Monetary Fund's limited program to increase storage and the central bank increased its storage by purchasing 200 metric tonnes of gold
 khaas baat he ki arabiai act kendriya rigerv bank ko sone main kharidari karne kii ijaajat detaa he

 Experts believe that in the US, the investment in gold is very important in the event of increasing interest rates

 Rural economy occupies the most important position in the country's economy
 desh main kul rojgaar kaa 70 fisadi rojgaar gaanvon main he
 50% of the country's GDP comes from the agriculture sector
 isse jaahir he pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa 8 november ko aayaa notebandi kaa faisle sabase bada asar rural india par daal chukaa he
 1
 jab desh main notebandi kaa faisla aayaa to desh ke kisaanon ke saamne rabi fasal kii buaai kii badi chunauti thi
 Rabi sowing had been done in many areas of Punjab and Haryana in North India, so they did not suffer the loss due to demonetisation
 2
 The biggest challenge faced by the farmers has been sowing the rabi crop for future purchases
 in kisaanon ke paas kharif fasal kaa paisa aa chukaa tha or yah vakt unke vaarshik kharidari jaise tactor, pump, khaad ityadi kaa tha
 But after the introduction of demonetisation, the challenge was to get these farmers to exchange notes first
 3
 In states where Rabi sowing is delayed, the biggest challenge before farmers was to buy seeds for sowing
 sarkaar kii taraf se tamaam ashwasan ke baavjood zyaadaatar kisaanon ko puraane pade beej se buaai kerani padi
 Due to the purchase of fertilizers from cash, they had to wait for the market to improve, which delayed their rabi sowing
 4
 The time of introduction of demonetisation became the biggest problem in the country for those farmers who depend on vegetable and fruit farming
 deshbhar main nagpur, nasik or dilli mandi puri tarah se cash par ashrith rahane ke kaaran puri tarah se thapp pad gai
 It became a compulsion for farmers to remove vegetables and fruits at cheap rates
 vahiin iske liye bhi unhen check athwa udhaar kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 5
 cash kii killatake chalate deshbhar main fal or subjiyon kii keemat buree tarah prabhavit hui
 Large quantities of tomatoes, potatoes, peppers and onions reach the market during this period
 lekin mandiyon main cash kii killat ne in utpaadon ke liye kisaanon ko bahut kam aay kaa saadhan bana diya
 6
 gramin ilaakon main rojgaar ke liye kendriya skim manaregaa buree tarah prabhavit hui he
 About a dozen states of the country have requested the Central Government to provide cash to the states with immediate effect as the government has not been able to pay the labor since demonetisation came into force
 7
 a major impact in reverse economy appeared to be reverse migration
 shaharon main real estate sector orindustry main lebar pementmen dikkaton ke chalate log gaanv kaa rukh karne par majaboor ho gaye
 Labor, who have migrated to the village since demonetisation came into force, are waiting for the cash crisis to end once again in the country
 8
 In the era of demonetisation, the biggest problem was seen in depositing old notes in rural areas and withdrawing new cash
 desh kii kul jansankhya kaa lagbhag 70 fisadi gaanvon main rahata he lekin unhen mahaj 45 fisadi kul atm kaa acces he
 At the same time, they had to travel 5 to 25 kilometers to withdraw from the ATM
 iske baavjood 9 november ke baad gramin ilaakon main atm or bank tak paisa pahunchane main sabase zyada samay laga
 9
 notebandi se pehle bhi desh main kaledhan ko chhipaane ke liye gramin ilaakon main kheti kii jameen ke kharid-farokht kaa mayajaal chalata tha
 After the ban on demonetisation, once again, a lot of efforts were made to hide black money in rural areas by misusing Zandhan accounts

 In this annual pilgrimage starting from July, this time the height of the holy Shivling is 13 feet, compared to the average 10-11 feet of the last few years

 Taking advantage of being the most agile of all his competitors due to the ruling, he had fielded all the 403 assembly seats in advance, he did so only when the formal selection of candidates in the Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress was done
 The process had not even started, the Samajwadi Party was surely behind them
 is tarah, is tathy ke maddenjar ki maujuuda vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal agle saal 20 may tak he, isliye vidhansabha chunaav farvari main punjab, uttarakhand or manipur ke saath bhi karaae ja sakate hai yaa phir ahdhail-may main to karaane hi honge, mayawati ne pradhanmantri ko likhe in taaja patron ke jariye chunavi dundubhi baja di he
 Advocating reservation for Muslims, he wrote to the Prime Minister, "the Muslim community has been backward since independence
 is samudaay kii sthiti main parivartan ke liye shiksha, naukari or jivan ke anya kshetron main avasar badaye jane kii jarurat he
 But he did not make an unexpected demand for reservation
 asal main 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main kargar rahi unki soshal ejineering ke chatakane kaa dar he
 Leaders like Samajwadi Party's aggressive Muslim face Azam Khan are trying to unite Muslims due to the decision of the Central Government and the Congress being battered by the environment against corruption

 At the same time, the upper caste votes which went with him in the last election, weakening of BJP and Congress and looking for an alternative against the then Mulayam Singh Yadav government, do not slip this time, due to this, he raised the demand of reservation for poor upper castes, especially BJP And has responded to the Congress strategy
 mayawati kahati hai, ''basapa aaj bhi sabase taqatvar he
 The next government will also be ours
 hamaare kaaryakarta virodhiyon ke bahekaave main na aaen
 "it is said that BSP placed the opinion of the government machinery in ticket distribution rather than its mps and ministers-mlas
 lekin rajya kii 16veen vidhansabha ke chunaav kii bisaat itani sidhi-saadi nahin he
 For Mayawati, it is not like the last assembly elections when every aspect like the silence of the central government, the strictness of the Election Commission, the anti-sp government trend, the bjp-congress plight were helpful to the BSP
 uske virdohi koi kam nahin hai
 The SP is also leaving no stone unturned in preparing for this possibly last election of Mulayam's active political life
 1987 main krantirath nikaal kar pradeshvyapee daura karne vaale mulaayam ke rajnatik uttaradhikaar ko aage badhaane ke liye unke putr akhilesh yadav rathyatra par nikle hai or basapa kii tarah hi sapa ne bhi kamobesh saare pratyaashee ghoshit kar die hai or chunavi ladaai ko dharaatal par utaar chuki he
 However, due to disputes in some seats, both BSP and SP have to change candidates

 In such a situation, the challenge is to appreciate the public sentiment and maintain its trust
 ''basapa or sapa donon hi ke liye yah chunaav behad ahm ho gaye hai or chunautiyaan bad gai hai
 While the BSP government has proved to be the real alternative to the SP in giving shelter to criminals and leaders of the mafia image, its supporters were also not as optionless as in the previous elections
 uske virdohi dalon main pehle se zyada dam he or sattavirohi rujhaan kaa bhi khamiyaja bhi use bhugatna he
 The BJP and the Congress are more than ever ready to lash out at the upper caste voters, especially the Brahmins and Vaishyas, who were with it in the last election, so non-jatav voters have a strong eye on the Dalits
 sapa kii dikkat yah he ki uske janaadhar main bikharaav jari he
 After the separation of Beni Prasad Verma, Yadav has remained prominent among the backward classes and his economic management has also gone awry after Amar Singh's separation
 vahiin musalamaanon ke vot paane ke liye use basapa or congress se tagdi ladaai ladani pad rahi he
 One problem is also the old age of SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav as he is no longer in a position to struggle like in previous elections
 itnaa hi nahin, unke liye mar mitane vaale yadav matadaataaon par bhi ab unki pakad pehle jaisi nahin dikhti
 Although the Yadav voters who have suffered the brunt of the officers and leaders in the BSP government may vote for them in abundance this time, but it can be said that even seeing the emerging Yadav leaders hovering among the Congress and BJP, 'netaji' The monopoly is about to break
 vahiin party ke muslim chehre ajam khan or anya pramukh muslim netaa rashid masood ke bich takaraav bhi charchaa ke centre main he
 However, this same weakness of the SP-BSP and the prevailing atmosphere against the Congress is giving unexpected strength to the BJP

 Both these leaders, who have been in the state for more than a month, have not only reduced the arrogance of the state leaders, but are also energizing the workers

 But the BJP, which pays more attention to book preparation and endless meetings than working among voters, is not going to contest elections by declaring its Chief Ministerial candidate like Congress
 vaise to calraj mishra or uma bharti main kisi ek ko ghoshit karne par bhi vichaar hua, lekin sutron kaa kahana he ki party isaki ghoshnaa kiye bagaiyr hi chunaav ladegi
 It is clear that BSP and SP are ahead of BJP and Congress in this matter

 The state in-charge of the party, Narendra Singh Tomar, has been running several programs to activate the party workers to the lower levels for the past several months

 One reason for postponing the list of candidates is a court ruling related to possible local bodies elections next week

 Since 1989, there has been an entire generation gap in the party running out of state power, but in the midst of nationwide outrage against the central government, in the last two decades, for the first time in the last two decades, there has been an increase in congressional ticket holders
 party mahasachiv rahul gandhi or pradesh prabharee mahasachiv digvijay singh dwaara tay kii gai pratyaashee chayan kii prakriya puri hone ko he or shaayad pehali baar congress ne kaaphi pratyaashiyon kaa faisla chunaav se arase pehle kar liya he
 It seems a bit unnatural for a party that holds the breath of potential candidates till the last date of nomination but also reflects its preparations
 pradesh ke netaaon kii khinchataan yahaan bhi kam nahin
 Due to the complicity of the leaders to get tickets for their favorite candidates, the declaration of candidates in many seats is being postponed

 The BJP is proving to be a failure in ticket distribution
 vaise party sutron ke mutabik kareeb 80 siton par maatr ek hi daavedaar hai, isliye unke elaan main koi aadchan nahin he
 But the party also wants to announce them only after Diwali

 In this way, there is a preparation for a big rally in Lucknow in the third week of November and it is possible to announce some candidates before that
 lekin vidhansabha chunaav sirf bade dalon kaa khel nahin he
 The natural power-aspiration of different castes, classes and groups in democracy has created many small parties
 rashtriya lokdal ke mukhiya ajit singh ne in footkar dalon ko teen maheene pehle ikattha karne kii koshish kii thi taaki bade dalon se badi deal kii ja sake
 It is worth noting that the 2007 assembly elections had disappointed the small parties which have been rubbing off for the last several elections as the BSP got an absolute majority and all the possibilities of horse-trading were destroyed
 ab asaar bahut kam hai ki ralod kaa congress yaa sapa ke saath koi gathbandhan hoga, isliye ye dal apane dam par hi lard sakate hai

 bataate hai ki apni naukarshahi ke dinon ke kuch doston ke jariye unhone mulaayam singh ko apni upadeyata samajhaaii, lekin vah mulaayam ke gale nahin utari
 However, given the kind of results that are being predicted, it seems that even if the electoral battle is a little difficult for the smaller parties, if they win the election then the subsequent battle can be very creamy
 kisi ek party kaa bahumat na aane kii sthiti main ek-ek seat paane vaale footkar dalon kii vakat badhani he

 According to the result of the 60-member assembly elections in Manipur so far, no party has got a clear majority with 31 seats

 sarkaar kaa aakhri purnabajatpadhate hue mahasoos hota he ki sarkaron ke taur-tareeke aatma kii tarah ajar-amar hai
 This soul changes the pernicious bodies of political parties every five years
 agarbajatse sarkaar kii kamai or kharch ko sansadeey manjuuri nikaal di jaae to phir is salanaa jalse main bachataa kya he? kyon bajet itane moolyawaan hai jabaki arthvyavastha kaa ek bada hissaa, bhagyavash, bajet yani sarkaar ke niyantran se baahar he, jahambajataki bhoomika paroksh hi hoti he
 Budgets raise curiosity because one shows the new idea of the government and the other is how well the government has implemented its previous idea (decisions, policies)
 bajet dekhakar ham aashwast ho sakate hai ki hamase liya gaya tex kaayade se kharch ho rahaa he or bainkon main hamaari jamaa jo karj main badal kar sarkaar ko mil rahi he, uskaa sahi istemaal ho rahaa he
 Budgets are always tight and immediate, the immediate criterion is whether the cost of living will increase or decrease
 mahangaai ore byaaj daren is kasuti kaa hissaa hai
 The far-reaching criterion is how convenient life will be
 sarkari skiimon kaa kriyanvayan is kasuti kii buniyaad hyaage or mahangaai hamehangaai jindagi jeene kii laagat badhaati he
 There was also inflation behind this budget which came out of GST and inflation is standing even further
 ek-kheti ke bade hue samarthan mulya kisaanon ko bhale hi na milen lekin bazaar ko yah ahsaas ho gaya he ki khaadya utpaadon ke mulya badhenge
 In many markets, a strong atmosphere is being created for crops whose yield is generally less than the demand
 daalen inamen pramukh hai mahangaai upabhoktaaon ke daravaaje par khadi he keemton teji rabi kii fasal bazaar main aane ke saath prarambh ho sakati haido-dher sari chizon par seemaa shulk badha he, jiesti kaa asar keemton par pehle se he khaastaur tex ke chalate sevaayen mahangi hui hantin-rajkoshiya ghaataa badaae se sarkaar kaa karj badhegaa jo mahangaai kii vajah hoga
 *** Four - crude oil prices have started rising, new cess has been imposed on petrol and diesel
 jo eendhan kii mahangaai ko asar karegaa
 This budget again proved that without increasing inflation, the government cannot run itself
 sarkaar apana kharch kam karne ko taiyaar nahin he isliye log mahangaai yaa tex kii maar ke badale hi kuch paane kii ummid kar sakate hai
 So to be aware: In the first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised restructuring of government spending
 skim-raaj !bhartiya gavarnence achche iraadon ko khokhale vaadon main badalane vaali mashin he
 To facilitate life, it is necessary to have better implementation of government schemes
 jetali jab 'duniya kii sabase badi swasthya beemaa skim kaa elaan kar rah the, unki apni hi sarkaar kii do asafal swasthya beemaa scimen unke peeche khadi thim
 Governance schemes have become boring
 inaki asafalataa asandigdh he
 When new governments introduce new schemes, people are disappointed, the hope is that the government will speed up the delivery of old schemes
 taaki sanad rahe: pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa sabase bada lakshya gavarnence yani ki sarkari kaaryakramon kaa kriyanvayan sudhaarna tha
 But they have to introduce new schemes budget by budget so that the poor implementation of the previous schemes can be forgotten
 skiimon kii bheed or unke bure haal se ab is sarkaar kii hi nahin, agali sarkaron kii saakh bhi khatre main rahegi
 Debt which will remain Mahagasta debt was one of the biggest objectives of demonetisation
 haalanki aisa hua nahin
 The stranded debts tied the hands of the banks
 notebandi ne un par byaaj kaa boj badha diya
 Inflation reached till the government support (capitalization) of the banks
 saat farvari ko rigerv bank jab maudrik niti kii samiksha karegaa, to use mahangaai or rajkoshiya ghate ko lekar khatre kii chetavaniyaan bhejni hongi
 Interest rates are now expected to be lower
 achraj nahin ki agar byaaj daren bad jaaen
 The state has increased the interest on its deposits so that depositors are connected to banks
 iskaa asar karj kii byaaj dar par hogaamodi sarkaar ke pehle do bajet (july 2014 or farvari 2015 ) abhi kal kii hi baat lagate hai jab dahaai ke ankon main vikaas dar, nai gavarnence, big idia, sabsidi main katautee, kharch main kami, ghate par kaabo, saste karj ke aahvaan ummiden jagaate the lekin aakhri bajet aate-aate mahangaai, kachche tel kii badhati keemat, skiimon kii baraat or baari tex laut aae hai
 And the recession is not yet gone The last budget of the government with the grandest mandate in recent decades is telling that the government can be changed in the elections but it is impossible to change the 'government'

 The story of Sai Vrat, Kokkila's sister and her husband Maheshbhai lived in the city
 donon main ek-duusare ke prati prem-bhav tha, parantu maheshabhai kaa swabhaav jhagadaalu tha
 Kokila sister on the other hand was a very religious woman, believing in God
 dhire-dhire unke pati kaa dhandha-rojgaar thap ho gaya
 Nothing was earned
 maheshabhai ab din-bhar ghar par hi rahete or ab unhone galat raah pakad lee
 Now his nature became even more irritable than before
 ek din dopaher ko ek vruddh maharaj daravaaje par aakaar khadey ho gaye
 He had a brilliant face and came and asked for dal and rice
 kokila bahan ne dal-chaaval die or donon haathon se us vruddh baba ko namaskara kiya
 The old man said, keep Sai happy
 kokila bahan ne kaha maharaj sukh meri kismat main nahin he or apane dukhi jivan kaa varnan kiya
 Maharaj told about the fast of Shri Sai, 9 thursday fruit or a meal, if possible, go to the Son Sai temple and worship Sai Baba at home on 9 th Thursday
 sai vrath karnaa or vidhi se udhyapan karnaa bhukhe ko bhojan dena, sai baba teri sabhi manokamana purna karenge, sai baba par atoot shraddha rakhana jaruri he
 Nightingale sister also took a Thursday fast
 9 wein guuruuvaar ko garibon ko bhojan karaayaa
 Disputes broke out of his house
 ghar main bahut hi sukh-shanti ho gai
 Maheshbhai's nature changed
 unka rojgaar phir se chaalu ho gaya
 In a short time, happiness and prosperity increased
 donon pati-patni sukhi jivan bitaane lage
 One day Kokila's sister's sister-in-law came from Surat
 baton-baton main unhone bataaya ki unke bachche padhai nahin karte, isliye pariksha main fail ho gaye hai
 Kokila Bahn conveyed the glory of 9 thursday and said that by devotion to Sai Baba, children will be able to practice well
 lekin iske liye sai baba par vishwaas rakhana jaruri he
 Sai helps everyone
 unki jethaani ne vrath kii vidhi bataane ke liye kaha
 Kokila Sister said that she told him all the things which the old Maharaj himself told her
 surat se unki jethaani kaa thode dinon main patr aayaa ki unke bachche sai vrath karne lage hai or bahut achche tarah se padhate hai
 He also fasted
 is bare main unhone likhaa ki unki saheli kii beti shaadi sai vrath karne se bahut hi acchhee jagah tay ho gai
 His neighbor's jewelry box was lost, which is now recovered
 aise kai adbhut chamatkaar hue tha

 mere alaava kai or logon ke naam likhe hai
 It is written in this context that we are among those who have written to the President for the forgiveness of Yakub Memon's execution
 awwal to maine aisi koi chitthee nahin likhi he or likhi bhi hoti to main nahin maanata, yah koi deshadroh he
 But who are those people who spread rumors about someone being a traitor
 aisa karte hue ve koun si adaalat, kanoon or desh kaa sammaan kar rahe hote hai
 Whether spreading rumors is also patriotic
 kisi ko in deshbhakton kaa bhi pataa lagaana chahie
 What work do they do for the country? inkaa naagarik aacharan kya he
 Generally, these people keep a check on the corruption of a party
 online duniya main ek dal ke liye ladate rahete hai
 Many parties now have such an online army
 inaki profile dal vishesh kii pahchaan chihnon se saji hoti hai
 Some have slogans, some have leaders and some have religious symbols
 kya hamaare loktantr ne inhen theka de rakhaa he ki ve deshadrohiyon kii pahchaan karen, unki timeline par hamalaa kar aatankit karne kaa prayaas karen
 In public life, our citizenship is enhanced by having a variety of questions
 kyon zaruri ho ki saare ek hi tarah se sochen
 Should someone think differently, a rumor should be spread against him and aggressive words are used
 ab aap pathakon ko iske khilaaf bolnaa chahie
 If you find this normal, then the problem is with you and you will be the victim
 ek din aapke khilaaf bhi whotsap par sandesh ghoomegaa or zehar failega, kyonki is khel ke niyam vahi tay karte hai, jo kisi dal ke samarthak hote hai, jinke paas sansaadhan or kutark hote hai
 Journalist Nikhil Waghale has also tweeted, "now, if you want to say anything in this country, you have to say it with the crowd of people, otherwise the other crowd will crush
 
 
 " aap saamaanya pathakon ko sochna chahie
 Whenever you say it, you will be alone
 puri duniya main online gundgardee ek khatarnaak pravriti ke rup main ubhar rahi he
 These are the people who terrorize your innocent children for a lifetime by becoming 'bullies' in schools, ending all possibilities of a girl's exit by standing at the locality square and destroying social prestige
 Let's blackmail by fearing
 aapane 'masaan' film main dekha hi hoga ki kaise vah krur thanedaar phone se record kar devi or uske baap kii zindagi ko khatm kar detaa he
 Before that Devi's lover kills the friend on the spot
 yah pravriti hatyaron kii he, isliye satark rahiye
 Of course you like any party, but even within that there is a debate about right and wrong
 chaar netaaon kii alag-alag line hoti hai, isliye aapako is pravriti kaa virodh karnaa chahie
 Remember, if their gang grows, one day you too will be trapped
 isliye agar aapaki timeline par aapkaa koi bhi dost aisa kar rahaa ho to use cheta dijie
 Break with him
 apni party ke netaa ko likhie ki yah samarthak rahegaa to ham aapke samarthak nahin rah paaenge
 Would you like to support a party where there are such online goons
 sawaal karnaa mukhaalafat nahin he
 There are such goons in every party
 iske kaaran online kii duniya ab nagarikon kii duniya rah hi nahin jaaegi
 Online hooliganism is not just in terms of hanging, religion or devotion to a leader
 film kalakaar anoushka sharma ne twit kiya he ki vah gair-zimmedaar baaten karne vaale yaa kisi kii pratishtha ko nuksaan karne waalon ko block kar dengi
 Pick up and read Monica Lewinsky's speech on TED once
 monica levinsky online gundgardee ke khilaaf kaam kar hi landan kii ek sanstha se jud gai hai
 Her pledge is that now she will not let anyone else fall prey to this hooliganism
 fasebuk par purv sampadak shambhunath shukla ke pej par jaakar dekhie
 He is troubled by such tendencies and vows to fight against them
 kuch bhi khulkar likhnaa mushkil ho gaya he
 Now you must have understood that balance and 'is equal to' is nothing but a trick to silence
 aap bolenge to ham bhi aapke bare main bolenge
 Should any civil society accept this? in tatwon ko nazarandaaz karne kii salaah bilkul aisi he ki aap in gundon ko sweekaar kar lijie
 do not pay attention
 sawaal he ki dhyaan kyon na den
 Many people who have done devotion in the name of the Prime Minister have suffered
 pradhanmantri ko lekar jab yah sab shuru hua to vah is khatare ko samaj gaye
 Public warnings were given, but later it was also revealed that many people who called and gave this warning, many of them do such work themselves
 isiilie maine kaha ki apane aasapaas ke aise mitron yaa anucharon par nigaah rakhie, jo online gundgardee karata he
 These people are breaking the etiquette of public life
 maujuuda sandarbh yaqub memon kii faansee kii sazaa ke virodh kaa he
 As long as there are all legal options against punishment, how did they become treason
 sawaal uthaane or samiksha kii maang karne vaale main to hindu, muslim, sikh or isai bhi hai
 The court did not say that they are committing treason by doing so
 agar is maamle main adaalat kaa faisla hi sarvocch hota to phir rajyapal or raashtrapati ke paas punarvichaar ke praavdhaan kyon hote
 Will these people also declare the framers of the Constitution as traitors
 yaqub memon kaa maamla aate hi ve log, jo vyaapman se lekar tamaam tarah ke bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke kaaran online duniya se bhaage hue the, laut aae hai
 They themselves take the cover of religion and scare others in the name of religion, because they get the ultimate moral force from religion itself
 ve us samuhikta kaa najayas laabh uthaate hai, jo dharm ke naam par apane aap ban jaati he yaa jiske ban jane kaa myth hota he
 In the movies, you must have seen many characters of Dada type, who will do hundred illegal acts, but will also do devotion
 isse vah samaaj main manyata hasil karne kaa kamazor prayaas karata he
 If the people of online hooliganism run, then the whole country will become traitorous
 yah bhi sahi he ki kuch logon ne yaqub memon ke maamle ko dharmikata se jodakar kaaphi nuksaan kiya he, galat kaam kiya he
 The hanging figures also confirm that the verdict is not related to religion
 lekin kya is baat kaa ve log khuraaq kii tarah istemaal nahin kar rahe hai, jo hameshaa isi firaaq main rahete hai ki koi chaara mili nahin ki uski charchaa shahar bhar main failaa do
 Have you heard him say that he opposes the association of religion, but also opposes the death penalty
 yaqub kaa maamla musalmaan hone kaa maamla hi nahin hai
 Reconsideration is a constitutional right
 nae tathy aate hai to use nae sire se dekhne kaa vivek or adhikaar adaalat ke paas he
 The comments 90 deshon main faansee kii sazaa kaa praavdhaan nahin hai
 Should not have been the case of terrorism and heinous crimes while deciding there
 barbarta ke aadhaar par faansee kii sazaa kaa karodon log virodh karte hai
 Terrorism is a major challenge
 hamane kai aatankwaadiyon ko faansee par latakaaya he, par kya usase aatankwaad khatm ho gaya
 Which purpose of punishment was served
 kya insaaf kaa yahi antim makasad he, jise lekar rashtrabhakti umad aati he
 What do these online patriots do for the families who were ruined by their attacks
 koi party vaala jaataa he unka haal poochne
 Had terrorism ended by hanging, terrorism would have disappeared from the world today
 aatankwaad kyon or kaise panapata he, use lekar bhole mat banie
 Face those cruel political truths
 agar iskaa kaaran dharm hota or faansee se hal ho jaataa to gurudaspur aatanki hamalaa hi na hota
 His attack will serve the political purpose, not the religious motive
 dharm to khuraaq he, taaki ek khaas kism kii juthi samuhik chetana bhadakaai ja sake
 Those who have jumped into this debate, their thinking and understanding does not go beyond religious identity
 ve kab pakistan ko aatanki bataa dete hai or kab usase haath milakar kootnithik itihaas rach dete hai, aisa lagata he ki sab kuch tu-in-van radio jaisaa he
 Played cassettes if i wished, radio if i wished
 man kiya to ham deshbhakt, man kiya to aap deshadrohi
 One should also explore these patriots
 ye desh ke liye koun-sa kaam karte hai
 What is their civil conduct? aam taur par ye log kisi party ke bhrashtacharon par pardaa daalate rahete hai
 Fight for a team in the online world
 kai dalon ke paas ab aisi online sena ho gai he
 Their profiles are adorned with team-specific identification marks
 kisi main naare hote hai to kisi main netaa to kisi main dharmik pratik
 Has our democracy contracted them to identify the traitors, try to terrorize them by attacking their timeline
 saarvajanik jivan main tarah-tarah ke sawaal karne se hamaari naagarikta nikharati he
 Why it is important that everyone think the same way
 kya koi alag soch rakhe to uske khilaaf afvaah failaai jaae or aakraamak lafzon kaa istemaal ho
 Now you readers should speak against it
 agar aapako yah saamaanya lagata he to samasya aapke saath bhi he or iske shikaar aap bhi honge
 One day the message will spread against you on whatsapp and poison will spread, because the rules of this game decide who are the supporters of any party who have the resources and sophistication
 patrkaar nikhil vaaghle ne twit bhi kiya he, "ab is desh main koi baat kehani ho to logon kii bheed ke saath hi kehani padegi, varna duusari bheed kuchal degi
 
 
 "you general readers should think
 aap jab bhi kahenge, akele hi honge
 Online hooliganism is emerging as a dangerous trend all over the world
 ye ve log hai, jo skulon main 'buli' banakar aapke maasoom bacchon ko jivan bhar ke liye aatankit kar dete hai, mohalle ke chowk par khadey hokar kisi ladki ke baahar nikalne kii tamaam sambhaavnaaon ko khatm karte rahete hai or saamaajik pratishtha ko dhwast karne kaa bhay dikhaakar blackmel karte hai
 You must have seen in the movie 'masaan' how he records the brutal police station phone and ends the life of Devi and her father
 usase pehle devi ke premi dost ko maukey par hi maar detaa he
 This tendency is of killers, so be cautious
 beshak aap kisi bhi party ko pasand karte hon, lekin uske bheetar bhi to sahi-galat ko lekar bahes hoti he
 Four leaders have different lines, so you should resist this trend
 yaad rakhiegaa, inkaa gang badhegaa to ek din aap bhi fansenge
 So if any of your friends are doing this on your timeline, then warn them
 usase naata tod lijie
 Write to the leader of your party that if it is a supporter then we will not be able to remain your supporter
 kya aap waisi party kaa samarthan karnaa chahenge, jahaan is tarah ke online gunde hon
 It is not a question to question
 har dal main aise gunde bhar gaye hai
 Due to this, the online world will no longer be a world of citizens
 online gundgardee sirf faansee, dharm yaa kisi netaa ke prati bhakthi ke sandarbh main nahin hoti he
 Film artist Anushka Sharma has tweeted that she will block those who do irresponsible talk or damage someone's reputation
 monica levinsky kaa ted par diya gaya bhaashan bhi ek baar uthaakar pard lijie
 Monica Lewinsky has joined a London organization working against online hooliganism
 unka pran he ki ab vah kisi or ko is gundgardee kaa shikaar nahin hone dengi
 Visit the page of former editor Shambhunath Shukla on Facebook
 aae din vah aisi pravriti se pareshaan hote hai or inase ladane kii pratigya karte rahete hai
 It has become difficult to write anything openly
 ab aapako samaj aa hi gaya hoga ki santulan or 'is equal to' kuch or nahin, balki chup karaane kii tarkeeb he
 If you speak, we will also speak about you
 kya kisi bhi naagarik samaaj ko yah manzur hona chahie
 The advice to ignore these elements is absolutely such that you accept these goons
 dhyaan mat dijie
 The question is why not pay attention
 pradhanmantri ke naam par bhakthi karne waalon kaa utpaat kai logon ne jhela he
 When all this started with regard to the Prime Minister, he understood this danger
 baqayada saarvajanik chetavanee di, lekin baad main yah bhi khulaasa hua ki jin logon ko bulaakar yah chetavanee di, unamem se kai log khud aisa kaam karte hai
 That is why i said that keep an eye on friends or followers around you, who commit hooliganism online
 ye log saarvajanik jivan ke shishtachar ko tod rahe hai
 The current reference is against the hanging of Yakub Memon
 jab tak sazaa ke khilaaf tamaam kanoonee vikalp hai, unka istemaal deshadroh kaise ho gaya
 Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians are also among those who raise questions and demand review
 adaalat ne to nahin kaha ki koi aisa kar deshadroh kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 If the court's verdict was supreme in this case then why would the Governor and President have provisions for reconsideration
 kya ye log samvidhan nirmaataaon ko bhi deshadrohi ghoshit kar denge
 Those people who ran away from the online world due to allegations of corruption ranging from Vyapam to Yakub Memon's case have returned
 khud dharm kii aad lete hai or duusare ko dharm ke naam par daraate hai, kyonki antim naitik bal inhen dharm se hi miltaa he
 They illegally take advantage of the collectivity that becomes or becomes a myth in the name of religion
 filmon main aapane dada tip ke kai kirdaar dekhen honge, jo sau najayas kaam karegaa, lekin bhakthi bhi karegaa
 This makes him a weak attempt to gain recognition in society
 agar online gundgardee karne waalon kii chali to puraa desh deshadrohi ho jayega
 It is also true that some people have done great harm, wrongdoing by linking Yakub Memon's case with righteousness
 faansee ke aankade bhi isaki pushti karte hai ki faisle kaa sambandh dharm se nahin he
 But are they not using this as a diet, who always live in such a situation that there is no option to spread the discussion across the city
 kya aapane inhen yah kehete suna ki ve dharm se jodne kaa virodh to karte hai, magar faansee kii sazaa kaa bhi virodh karte hai
 Yakub's case is not a case of being a Muslim
 punarvichaar ek sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 The court has the discretion and right to see it afresh if new facts come
 tippaniyan There is no provision for capital punishment in 90 countries
 kya vahaan yah tay karte hue aatankwaad or jaghanya aparaadhon kaa maamla nahin aayaa hoga
 Hundreds of people protest against the punishment on the grounds of vandalism
 aatankwaad ek badi chunauti he
 We have hanged many terrorists, but has terrorism ended
 sazaa kaa koun-sa makasad puraa hua
 Is this the ultimate aim of justice, about which nationalism comes up
 inke hamalon se jo parivaar barbaad hue, unke liye ye online deshbhakt kya karte hai
 a partyman goes to ask their condition
 faansee se aatankwaad khatm hota to aaj duniya se aatankwaad mit gaya hota
 Don't be naive about why and how terrorism thrives
 un krur raajnneetik sachchaaiyon kaa saamana kiijie
 If the reason for this was religion and would have been solved by hanging, then there would have been no Gurudaspur terror attack
 unke hamale se dharmik makasad nahin, raajnneetik makasad hi puraa hota hoga
 Religion is food, so that a certain kind of false collective consciousness can be instigated
 jo log is bahes main koode hai, unki soch or samaj dharmik pahchaan se aage nahin jaati he
 When they describe Pakistan as a terrorist and when they join hands and create diplomatic history, it seems that everything is like two-in-one radio
 man kiya to casette bajaayaa, man kiya to radio
 If we feel like we are patriots, if you feel like you are a traitor
 saarvajanik jivan main tarah-tarah ke sawaal karne se hamaari naagarikta nikharati he
 Why it is important that everyone think the same way
 kya koi alag soch rakhe to uske khilaaf afvaah failaai jaae or aakraamak lafzon kaa istemaal ho

 If we feel like we are patriots, if you feel like you are a traitor

 Face those cruel political truths

 His attack will serve the political purpose, not the religious motive
 dharm to khuraaq he, taaki ek khaas kism kii juthi samuhik chetana bhadakaai ja sake
 Those who have jumped into this debate, their thinking and understanding does not go beyond religious identity

 The BJP announced the Raj Bhavan Chalo program on 25 January and the meeting of President Pratibha Patil in Delhi on 24 January, demanding the recall of the Governor
 yediurppa par palatwaar karte hue rajyapal ne ek patr main sakhti se kaha ki vah bhrashtachar ke gambhir aaropon ko dhank nahin sakate
 Just last September 26, a letter was issued by the Secretary, Department of Official Language, Government of India, addressed to the Secretaries of the Ministries and Departments of the Central Government
 iskaa vishay haih sarkari kaamkaaj main saral or sahaj hindi ke prayog ke liye niti-nirdesh
 This is a policy directive issued in the right direction
 rajbhasha vibhaag pehle se hi aise disha-nirdesh jari karata rahaa he ki sarkari kaamkaaj kii bhashaa aasaan honi chahie
 He has also been repeated in this letter quoting him
 04 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india todaper is baar ke patr ke chathe pare main rajbhasha vibhaag ne apni manshaa or zyada khulkar jaahir kar di he
 The objective is clear that the Department of Official Language wants to be in conformity with modern Hindi
 yadi aisa nahin hua to shaskeey bhashaa aam janata kii bhashaa se pichad jaaegi yaa cat jaaegi
 Then, the official language will become a different type of Hindi and it will no longer be of use to the common people
 vah samaaj ke varchasvvaadi or swaarthee logon kaa hit saadhan karne lagegi jabaki hindi ko rajbhasha kaa darja dene main hamaare samvidhan nirmaataaon kaa yah aashay katai nahin tha
 Therefore, for the fulfillment of the right objective, it is necessary that the Official Language Hindi speakers should adopt their own language
 jin kii vajah se or jin ke liye hindi rajbhasha bani he, jab unheen kii samaj main yah nahin aegi to samajhe ki unke saath baari dhokhaa ho gaya he
 December 28, 2011: See in pictures India Today, i have felt a place in the letter that the Department of Official Language has moved beyond its limits
 unhen apni baat kehani thi, so kah deni chahie thi
 What has been said is not wrong either
 mujhe keval yah kahana he ki kehane kaa dhang uchit nahin he
 He has compared the official language to the literary language which was not required
 yah un kaa vishay nahin hona chahie tha
 Beginning the second paragraph of his letter, the secretary wrote - "there are two forms of any language - literary and working language
" kaamkaaj kii bhashaa main saahitiyik bhashaa ke shabdon ke istemaal se us bhashaa vishesh kii ore aam aadmi kaa rujhaan kam ho jaataa he or uske prati maansik virodh badhata he
 "he has written the last sentence of the third para -" The pure form of language is for the literary world; The popular and mixed form of language is for colloquial and functioning
 ''21 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todegalat, bilkul galat
 As far as i understand, it was not the domain of the Department of Official Language to speak about literature by comparison
 masalan, dalit sahitya hindi main apane parivesh kii vishisht bhashaa laa rahaa he
 Till now his language was unknown to Hindi literature
 tab rajbhasha vibhaag yah kaise kah saktaa he ki ''bhashaa kaa vishuddh rup sahitya jagat ke liye he?''sahitya main apratyaksh rup se kise vishuddh bhashaa maan liya gaya he? is se sahityakaron ke bich ek galat sandesh jaataa he ki sanskrit ke dharre ke sahityakar asli sahityakar hai
 The right thing is that Dalit literature is also fighting in the field of literature with the same burdensome language which the Department of Official Language is sadly issuing its letter
 14 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todayah kahana ekadam anuchit he ki bhashaa kaa vishuddh rup sahitya jagat ke liye he
 Due to Sanskrit, the artificial language which is being prevented from being used in official work, the same difficult vocabulary and arduous style of Sanskrit language is being boycotted in literature
 donon jagah ek hi ladaai chal rahi he, chaahe vah rajbhasha vibhaag ho yaa sahitya jagat ho
 If the official language is to be connected with the public, then literature also does not have to go away from the common man

 Significantly, in the terrorist attacks in Mumbai on 26 November, around 190 people were killed and more than 300 people were injured

 In fact, on Monday, the BJP protested against the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh over the increased electricity bill and debt waiver
 akaash vijayawargeey ne indore main pradarshan kiya tha
 At the same time, while addressing the workers, Akash Vijayvargiya said that 'these are just two demands from the government that all the ministers, mlas and Congress leaders should reach the ground as soon as possible and compensate the farmers for the damage caused by rain
 
 'vahiin, iske baad bijli ke bade hue bilon par bayaan dete hue akaash vijayawargeey ne kaha ki 'meri chetavanee he ki jald se jald bade hue bill maaf karen yaa pehle kii tarah saste bill bhejein
 Otherwise like Manoj Bhaiya told that we will lock the room and you know that we do not roam empty handed
 'akaash vijayawargeey ke is bayaan ko puraani ghatana se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he jab ballakand ke baad akaash ko jail janaa padaa tha or desh bhar main bijepi kii kirakiri hui thi
 Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi had misunderstood Akash Vijayvargiya's behavior in a BJP meeting
 bataa den ki isse pehle indore main ek jarjar imaarat ko giraane pahunchi nigam kii team ke adhikari par akaash vijayawargeey ne bat chalaa diya tha
 After the incident, Akash Vijayvargiya was not only arrested by the police but had to remain in jail for about 5 days
 iske baad bhopal kii vishesh adaalat se akaash vijayawargeey kii jamaanat hui thi

 At the time of announcement of election dates, the Commission also gives information about how many polling booths are sensitive or very sensitive
 kanoon vyavastha ke lihaaj se in poling boothon kaa akalan kiya jaataa he or usee ke mutabik suraksha vyavastha bhi kii jaati he
 One such polling booth is in the village of Jui Khurd in Haryana, but now the villagers want to remove the title which has been in place for decades
 yah poling booth haryana ke bhivani-mahendragarh sansadeey kshetra ke gaanv jui khurd main he
 The Election Commission declared the polling station as very sensitive in 1989 after the death of one person due to firing in a clash between two groups during the elections
 gaanv waalon ke mutabik, iske baad se gaanv ke liye yah ek sthaayee tag ho gaya he
 The village has a population of over 6000, headed by a female sarpanch
 gaanv kii sarpanch rup pati ne news agency bhashaa ko bataaya ki ghatana ke baad se saat aam chunaav hue hai or sabhi shantipurna rahe hai
 Roop Pati says that the village has developed a lot and we are happy with the progress but being very sensitive to it not only affects our image but also the future prospects
 unhone kaha, 'itnaa lanbaa vakt biit jane ke baad bhi koi durghatana nahin hui he to aise main ham sarkaar ke saath-saath chunaav ayog se bhi apil karte hai ki isaki samiksha kii jaae or ati samvedansheel ke tag ko hataaya jaae'
 At the same time, according to Ramesh Bahadur, who is planning to contest the next election of Sarpanch, the Election Commission keeps repeating the old list without conducting any new investigation

 Amid speculation over the success of the main opposition party's 'modi bet', Professor Ashutosh Mishra, professor of political science and political analyst at Lucknow University, said the bjp's move was inspired by the party's performance in the last six Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh is
 is ullekh par ki bijepi to be-lagaam mahangaai, bhrashtachar or vikaas ke mudde par chunaav maidan main utarane kii baat kah rahi he, phir adwani kii naaraazgi or jediu se gathbandhan todane kii keemat par modi ko aage kyon kiya, mishra ne kaha ki raajnneeti main kuch baaten kahi jaati hai or kuch baaten bina kahe kahi jaati hai, jise ‘messaging’ kehete hai
 Stating that messaging is part of the 'trigger mechanism', which means generating 'current' on the side
 unhone kaha ki modi bijepi ke usee maikenism kii kunjee hai, jo virodhiyon main gujarat dangon ke liye kose jate hai to prashansakon main gujarat ke vikaas ke liye saraahe jate hai
 This is his 'USP'

 Mishra said that election figures show that bjp's success in national politics has depended on its performance in Uttar Pradesh
 unhone kaha, ‘varsh 1991 main party ne pehali baar loksabhaa main 100 siton kaa aankada paar kiya tha or tab use uttar pradesh kii 85 loksabhaa siton main 51 siten mili thim
 'mishra said,' In the year 1996, BJP emerged as the largest party in the Lok Sabha with 161 seats for the first time and then it won 52 out of 85 seats of this state
 bijepi netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi pehali baar pradhanmantri bane haalanki vah sarkaar bahumat ke abhaav main 13 din hi chal paayi
 'with the mention that the BJP got 57 seats from Uttar Pradesh in the total 182 seats in the Lok Sabha in the year 1998 and in 1999, the state contributed 29 seats in 182, Mishra said that so far three times at the Center The NDA government has been formed under the leadership of the BJP and Uttar Pradesh has been the largest contributor on all three occasions
 mishra kaa kahana he ki bijepi ko uttar pradesh main sabase chaunkaane vaale parinaam 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mili
 Then, despite the achievements of a successful government at the Center for five years and a personality and liberal face like Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he won only 10 out of 80 seats in the state and remained on the throne of Delhi with the slogan of 'india Shining' His dream of breaking up

 There is still a story about a high-flying recruiter - Russell Purushothaman from Wipro Technologies
 shahar se aadhe ghante kii duuri par nunna gaanv main jab koi purushottaman kaa naam letaa he to placement adhikari apni aawaaj dhimi karke fusfusaahat ke str par le jate hai
 The village has at least five engineering colleges
 kuch saal pehle purushottaman yahaan ek maseehaa jaisaa tha
 Till his sudden disappearance, he used to recruit more students than any other recruiter and get them higher salary
 uske ek purv sahyogi ke anusaar, vah bahut 'shaatir' tha
 He reportedly used to sell jobs, 7 to visit the college
 5 lakh ru
 And his game of Rs 50,000 for each offer letter came to an end when one of his associates saw a college advertisement in the newspaper and complained
 is vigyaapan main un chaatro kii tasviren thim, jinhen wipro ne chunaa tha
 One of these pictures was of a girl, who was rejected by this complainer
 jab or gade murde khode gaye to wipro ke adhikariyon ne purushottaman ko bangaloru main talab kiya or usase chah ghante tak poochtacha ke baad fatkaar lagaakar baahar nikaal diya
 Apart from this, the company also filed a fraud case at Madhapur Police Station in Hyderabad
 yah maamla adaalat ke vichaaradhin he
 Police officials confirm that Wipro has filed a case against Purushothaman
 jab samvaadadaataaon ne ek email main is vishay kaa khulaasa kiya, to wipro kii media relations team kii sadsy subhashini pattabhiraman ne iskaa jawaab recruitment dhokhadhadi se bachane ke liye kiye gaye upayon, jan jaagrukta laane ke liye kiye gaye prayaason or echaar main bhrashtachar ke duusare sambhavit kshetron ko rokane kii ranneeti ke vivaranon se diya
 The 603 words in this document did not mention Russell or Purushothaman

 The 100% placement hunger typically traps colleges in the trap of thug recruiters and placement consultants who are not accredited, and are located in areas where well-known recruiters have less movement
 chaatro ko aakarshith karne ke liye unhen recruiters kii jarurat hoti he or chaatr sirf tab aaenge, jab recruiters aaenge
 In such a situation, there are some helpers, middlemen, corrupt employees, college officials who are ready to pay bribe
 ve collejon ko duniya ke saamne '100 percent placement' or guarntid vetan kaa elaan karne ke liye protsaahit karte hai
 According to research reports, only a few out of outs with professional colleges are directly employable
 pareekshan or moolyankan karne vaali company marittrack dwaara karaae gaye ek taaja adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki top 25 ko chhod den, to 100 sansthaaon se nikle 2,264 emb main se recruiting companiyon ko keval 21 fisadi hi rojgaar ke laayak najar aae
 According to another assessment company Aspiring Minds, 17 of engineering graduates
 5 fisadi se bhi kam ko ity main rojgaar diya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, any claim of "100% placement" should be viewed with suspicion
 lekin aap yah baat aise utsuk mata-pita se kah kar to dekhie, jo emb yaa ejineering kii degree ko apane bachche ke liye bepanaah dhan-daulat tak pahunchane kii seedhi maanate hai
 The middlemen are happy in this situation
 unke aane-jane, thaharne or anya aavashyaktaaon kaa bhugtan college karte hai
 In one case, a recruiter spent Rs 25,000 in a single night on foreign liquor in a small town hotel
 uda die
 In return, the college gets the right to brag
 lekin chaatr is khai main gir jate hai, jo in donon ke bich main hoti he
 HR professionals say that the number of students falling in this trough is in thousands every year
 vijaywada ke prasad ve
 "I have to face parental pressure," says Sai Krishna Kota, training and placement officer at Potluri Siddharth Institute of Technology
 ve poochhate hai ki kuch companiyaan jab padosi college kaa daura kar rahi hai, to ve mere college main kyon nahin aa rahi hai
 They say, 'give them money, bring a company at any cost
 '' college kehete hai ki mata-pita ke dabaav main placement main aniatik vyavhaar shuru hota he
 Bribes in lieu of placements, although colleges on their part are also willing to obey the parents and are more willing to pay bribes if they receive placements than bribes
 andhra pradesh, tamilnadu, karnataka, maharashtra, uttar pradesh or chhattisgarh ke gramin ejineering collejon ke 15 se bhi adhik placement adhikariyon ne bataaya ki kisi achche saal main unke placement 20 se 60 fisadi ke bich ho jate hai
 Rural colleges, especially those built in the last five-six years, struggle to bring large recruiters to their campuses
 ve echaar karmiyon ko rishwat dete hai, bichauliyon kii madad lete hai, or nateeja farji companiyon ko nimantrit karne main nikalataa he
 Mukti Mishra, co-founder of Centurion University of Technology and Management, who runs a college in Gajapati, Odisha, one of the poorest districts in India, says, "despite all the attempts to reach Wipro directly, i have to fail to catch the path of middlemen Was lying
 ''pichley varsh ke ant main lagaaya gaya bichauliya ab tak wipro ko yaa us str kii kisi anya company ko centurian tak laane main vifal rahaa he
 After the Purushothaman episode, Wipro has tightened the HR process
 vah recruitment ke liye tabhi aati he, jab college manyata praapt ho yaa sheersh str kii companiyon ke panel main ho
 The agreement between a rural college and a middleman in Bangalore is eye-opening
 in donon main se kisi kaa bhi naam nahin liya ja saktaa he, kyonki bichauliye ne college ko parinaam bhugatne kii or aatmahatya kar lene kii dhamkee di he
 Under this agreement it has been said that for starting accreditation in Wipro and TCS, the college will pay Rs 10 lakh
 advance ke taur par degaa
 When told this to TCS, the company said it had "never heard of anyone like him
" '' wipro kaa kahana he ki uskaa is bichauliye ke saath koi sambandh nahin he, jabaki is bichauliye kaa daawa he ki vah pichley ek dashak main kam-se-kam 30,000 graduates ko naukari dilava chukaa he
 It is not so easy for the colleges to dismiss the trap of such middlemen
 vastav main ve ise paalane ke liye majaboor ho rahe hai
 Placement officials say no work is done without giving money or gifts
 jab companiyon kii echaar timen doordaraj ke campason main jaati hai, to unke tikaton or thaharne kaa bhugtan college karte hai
 When offer letters are found, they pay the favor by giving them mobile phones, tablets and even gold
 yah sab is ummid main kiya jaataa he ki ve agle varsh phir aaenge or badi sankhya main bhartiyon karenge
 In September last year, Mindtree, a mid-sized IT company, recruited from a college in Tirupati
 is saal may main jab do echaar akjicutive ne emplai ingerement yatra par usee college kaa daura kiya, to donon ko 75,000 ru
