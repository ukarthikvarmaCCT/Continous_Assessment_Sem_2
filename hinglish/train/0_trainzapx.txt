 bharat ke khilaaf kuch samay pehle sampann ekadivasiy shrunkhlaa main viraat kohli par dabadabaa banane ke baad pakistan ke baayen haath ke tej gendbaaj junayd khan ne kaha ki unhen pataa tha virdohi team ke is ballebaaj ko unki line or length samajhane main dikkat hogi
 In all three odis, Kohli was dismissed by Junaid
 tippaniyan Junaid said before the team's departure for South Africa, i remember Kohli and i met before the ODI series and he told me that he would play his shots and score runs against me
 unhone ‘jeeyo news’ se kaha, uski pratishtha ko dekhte hue main thodaa ashankit hua, lekin jab maine pehle ekadivasiy match main gendbaaji shuru kii to sab kuch mere liye sahi hota chalaa gaya
 i knew that he would have trouble understanding my line and length and i bolded him before opening the account
 junayd ne kaha, agle do maichon main bhi hamaari pratidwandvita jari rahi or use saste main pavilion bhejkar hameshaa manobal badhata he, kyonki vah stareey ballebaaj he
 Junaid had taken eight wickets in three matches in that series
 junayd ne dakshin africa ke liye team kii ravaanagi se pehle kaha, mujhe yaad he ki ekadivasiy shrunkhlaa se pehle kohli or meri mulaakaat hui or usne mujhe ki vah apane shot khelegaa or mere khilaaf ran banayega
 "I was a little apprehensive given his reputation, but when i started bowling in the first ODI, everything went right for me," he told Geo News
 mujhe pataa tha ki use meri line or length samajhane main dikkat hogi or maine use khaataa kholane se pehle hi bold kar diya
 "our rivalry continued in the next two matches as well and sending him cheap pavilions always boosts morale as he is a quality batsman," Junaid said
 junayd ne us shrunkhlaa main teen maichon main aath wicket chatkaaye the

 Ultimately, the judgment of the Mughal ruler Babur will also be tested and a judgment will be pronounced in the court of democracy
 ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayee supreme court main chal rahi he or 30 sitambar ko muslim paksh kii taraf se ek daleel di gai ki babar ek samprabhu shaasha tha or samprabhu shaasha jameen kaa maalik bhi tha
 His work will be seen from the perspective of the law in force at that time
 bhale hi usne jabaran kabja karke paap kiya ho lekin is par faisla karne kaa haq is adaalat ko nahin he
 Advocate Nizamuddin Pasha was represented on behalf of Muslim parties Mibahuddin and Haji Mahmud
 darasal pasha, hindu paksh kii us daleel kaa virodh kar rahe the jisamen kaha gaya tha ki babar ne ayodhya main ram janmasthan todakar masjid banaai thi
 That mosque was not in accordance with Islamic standards
 babar ek taanashaah tha
 The dictator is the person who uses the power at will
 is maamle main bhi sarvocch adaalat darasal ek taanashaah ke faisle ko hi parakh rahi he
 Till now democracy has been considered the best form of power and in terms of Indian traditions, ideal governance is called Ramrajya
 babar ke faisle ko loktantr kii adaalat parakh nahin sakati yaa us par koi faisla nahin kar sakati- ye daleel hi taanaashaahee vaali he
 In a democracy, decisions ranging from President to Parliament and Prime Minister can be reviewed
 shaktiyon kaa vikendrikaran hi loktantr kii sabase badi khaasiyat hoti he
 In dictatorship all the economic, military, judicial and administrative powers are in the same person and its religious beliefs are at the top
 jaahir he aise main vah apni bepanaah shakti kaa istemaal kaise bhi kar saktaa he or use rokane-tokane vaala koi nahin hota he
 There is no doubt that Babur was also an invader and he established Mughal rule on the strength of strength
 nirankush taanaashaahon ke faisle hameshaa logon ke liye badi musiibat banakar saamne aate hai
 There are many examples of this like Hitler, Mussolini etc
 and the governments that came after them have erased every trace of them
 jis europe se aaj ke loktantr kaa vikaas hua vahaan bhi nirankush shaskaon par ankush lagane se hi loktantr kii shuruyaat hui thi
 The first written document for the rule was called Magnacarta, which was made in Britain
 magnacarta kii rachana babar ke bharat aane se kareeb 300 saal pehle yani aaj se 800 saal pehle hui thi
 However, Magnacarta was an initiative and the existing form of democracy developed much later in which powers were decentralized
 baad main lokantatr main dharm ko satta se alag kiya gaya
 Although religion is included in the power of many countries even today, there is no India-like form of democracy there
 ayodhya masale ke sandarbh main babar ke faisle kii samiksha loktantr kii sarvocch adaalat kar rahi he or vah apane swabhaav main dharm ke prabhaav main nahin he
 Whereas if Babur had demolished the temple and built a mosque, it would certainly be said to be under the influence of his religion
 yah kaam dharmanirpekshata ke vipareet tha jabaki babar ke us kaam kii samiksha dharmanirpeksh, samprabhu rajya kii nishpaksh adaalat kar rahi he
 So this argument and the demand made in it neither embraces nor stops anywhere
 aisi daleelein paksh kamjor karti hai

 yah baat sahi he ki vigat 3 dinon se iske padchihn nahin mil rahe hai, chunki chaaron taraf kadi mitti he

 But, Dhoni caught the ball fast and played a peculiar shot with one hand on the full stretch and failed Sodhi's plan and said that who is the master of cricket? India, 'super Sunday' will be decided to make history in New Zealand

 Even before this, Dhoni has made a lot of headlines with his action in front of the wicket
 dhoni 2017 main newjiland ke khilaaf ek tii-20 match main apane aap ko stump hone se bachaane ke liye stretch hue the
 In 2017, this second T20 match played against New Zealand in Rajkot saw Dhoni's fitness

 The 'hitman' charisma did not leave a stumping chance behind the wicket as India overtook India's historic 'hat-trick' Dhoni in world cricket

 shuukravaar ko karishma se ghar ke sadasyon ko 'party to banati he' task ke aadhaar par reating dene ke liye kaha jayega
 She will give 80 out of 100 to Pritam and 50 to Praneeth, which will hurt both
 jab preetam karishma se puuchhenge ki unhone aisa kyon kiya, to ve kahengi ki upain ne preetam se acha kaam kiya he
 Pritam looked lazy during the task
 karishma preetam ko 95 ank dengi
 This will make Pritam angry
 karishma dimpi ko 85 ank dengi
 Pritam would feel bad because Dimpy had not even participated in the task preparations
 karishma kahengi ki unhone upain or diyandra ko 95-95 ank dengi kyonki donon ne sajaavat main hissaa liya or dinyadra ne biimaar hone ke baavjood kaam kiya
 When Pritam talks to Karishma about this, she will present her arguments
 pranit ko bhi kharaab lagegaa lekin vah kuch bolegaa nahin
 Pritam and Praneeth will talk to Puneet and say that this has revealed the true color of Karishma
 karishma upain or diyandra kaa paksh lengi
 So will P3G return? karishma yah reating kanfeshan room main dengi
 The task of captaincy is also running in the house
 kursi ko lekar sab intjaar karte hai
 Dimpy asks Ali for permission to sit on the chair
 sabhi gharavaale ali ko manaane lagate hai
 At this Ali will say that he is playing for himself
 isliye vah kisi kii baat nahin maanata he
 Dimpy harasses Ali all day
 uske baad vah mirchi kaa pani uske upar daalane kii baat kahati he
 When she gets close to Ali, he immediately stands up and grabs Dimpy's seat
 iske baad dimpi seat par baith jaati he
 Ali and Dimpy get into an argument
 donon big bos par chhodte hai ki ve kise captain banaaenge
 There is also a truth of Ayodhya that the climate here changes with politics
 wo chaahe 30 saal pehle jor pakadta mandir nirmaan andolan ho yaa 25 saal pehle kaa babari vidhwans
 In the city of religion, the echo of politics is heard with every incident
 pichley 25 saal main hi ayodhya ko lekar surkhiyaan itani badal chuki hai, ki ab adalati daanvpech se behatar sulah samjhauta hi lagata he
 i wish some formula would suggest politics
 masjid-mandir or hindu-muslim packvval to sahmati hoti, to ye vivaad itane uljhe hue mukaam tak pahunchataa hi nahin
 If such claims were not made on the basis of religion and belief, it was not that Ayodhya dispute would not be resolved
 iske liye pahal shri shri ravishankar or mughal vanshaj prince yaqub ke saath pehali baar nahin ho rahi he, balki babari masjid dhahaae jane ke pehle se hi aisi koshishen shuru huin
 But she failed
 pehali koshish veepi singh ke samay main hui, donon pakshakaron se baatcheet ke silsile bhi shuru ho gaye
 But the politics took such a turn that the agreement which was being brought to ordinance was withdrawn
 iske baad ayodhya vivaad ke samaadhaan kii duusari pahal tatkaaleen pradhanmantri chandrashekhar ke daur main shuru hui or ye samaadhaan ke kareeb thi
 But his government was unfortunate
 uske baad narsimha raav ne prayaas kiya lekin phir bhi antim hal tak nahin pahunchaa ja sakaa
 After this, there was no attempt to reconcile at the government level
 narsimha chaahakar bhi nahin roak paae babari dhwansababari masjid ke dhwans or apane puure kaarykaal par narsimha raav ne kitaab bhi likhi, jiske mutabik wo chaahate hue bhi is ghatana ko roak nahin paae or ye baat unhen der tak kachotati rahi
 Perhaps in this repentance, he also took the initiative to settle the dispute, but by then everything had changed
 dharm kaa lihaaj or raajnneeti kaa agenda sabakuch
 But after Atal Bihari Vajpayee came to power, this matter started to smell once again
 maamle kii gambhirtha ko samajhate hue vaajapeyi ne pradhanmantri karyaalay main ayodhya vibhaag kaa gathan kiya or varisht adhikari shatrughna singh ko donon pakshon se baatcheet ke liye niyukt kiya
 Even in the Vajpayee government, there was no agenda regarding the temple, the alliance led by Vajpayee was right, the first government with a majority of BJP was formed at the center

 masalaa yah tha ki kya kisi aitihaasik charitra ko nai katha main dhaala ja saktaa he

 Now it is a different matter that the novel was also considered politically damaging and the author had to face the penalty of life-long exile
 haalanki yah bhi alag baat he ki 'gulaag' jaisi rachanaaon kaa zikr kisi taatkaalik laabh ke liye likhe gaye upanyaas yaa kisi raajnneetik film kii charchaa ke dauraan karnaa thik nahin

 People put various decorations and lakhs of rupees for the guests to eat at weddings
 in sabake bich gujarat ke surat main ek aisi shaadi hui jisane sabakaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 Simple wedding, in fact, the bride and groom did not spend one rupee in this wedding
 shaadi mandir main hui or jo mehmaan aae the wo khaanaa apane ghar se tiffin main banaakar lekar aae the
 Neither dowry nor dowry was taken by any girl
 ladki mahaj ek jode kapade main shaadi ke liye mandir pahunchi thi
 This family believes in the Kabirpanthi Satnam Sanstha
 shaadi itani saadagi se hui ki mandir main kuch mantra bulawaae gaye or shaadi ho gai
 Neither food nor wedding was the most appealing part of the wedding
 yahaan jo log bhi shaadi main shariq hone aae ve apane-apane ghar se tiffin lekar aae the
 In which people got together and ate their own tiffin
 khaas baat yah bhi rahi ki shaadi main aae mehmaan koi gift bhi lekar nahin aae the
 Everyone was giving blessings only to the bride and groom
 aaj kii mahangaai ke vakt main ye shaadi sach main ek udhaaharan he ki duulhaa-dulhan ne ek paisa bhi kharch nahin kiya or phir bhishadiho gai

 Vidarbha used to be a strong bastion of the Congress, Vidarbha region of Maharashtra has been a strong stronghold of the Congress in the decisive role of Dalit voters in Vidarbha
 indira gandhi ke dwaara lagaae gaye apatkaal ke baad bhi vidarbha ke logon ne congress kaa saath nahin choda tha, lekin rashtriya raajnneeti narendra modi ke udai hone ke baad congress kaa yah durg puri tarah se darak gaya he or ab bijepi yahaan puri tarah se kabiz he
 In order to maintain its strong hold on the region, the BJP has also worked in its favor in the caste equation, in such a situation, the Congress has to struggle in this election to preserve its existence in Vidarbha
 vidarbha hua karata tha congress kaa gadhvidarbha par hameshaa se congress kaa prabhaav rahaa he
 The result of this was that even after the imposition of Emergency by Indira Gandhi, the Congress was not defeated in Vidarbha

 While the Congress suffered a crushing defeat across the country, it retained its grip in Vidarbha
 vidarbha se aane vaale congressi netaa hameshaa se dilli ke netaaon ke kareebi hone ke liye jane jate rahe hai
 Taking care of the caste equation, the Congress strengthened its roots in Vidarbha
 vidarbha ne maharashtra ko marotrao kannamvaar, vasantrao nike, sudhakararav nike jaise mukhyamantri die hai
 However, due to the changing political equation and the withdrawal of Congress from power at the center in 2014, the internal conflict in Vidarbha Congress increased and BJP and Shiv Sena took advantage of it

 Vidarbha's political issue, the backwardness in terms of development, has been the hallmark of Vidarbha

 But, in this environment, a newspaper with no special identity of Peshawar is earning very well
 is safalataa kaa raaj yah he ki iskaa maalik khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa praant kaa ek mantri he jiske mantri banane ke baad is akhbaar ko milane vaale vigyapanon kii dher lag gai
 This information has been given in the report published in Pakistani media
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki akhbaar kii vaastavik prasar sankhya kii jaanch-padtaal kiye bina iske vigyapanon main badhotaree kar di gai or rate bhi badhaakar die gaye
 The report said that the newspaper, through its owner Provincial Minister, has got a record business of five crore 74 lakh 20 thousand rupees
 report main mantri kaa naam nahin diya gaya he lekin unke hawaale se kaha gaya he ki vigyaapan dene main koi gadabadi nahin kii gai he or vah to akhbaar ke maalik bhi nahin hai
 However, it has been revealed from the government document that he has given the rights of publication of the newspaper to his brother, but the right to print it still remains with him
 is bare main jab unase phone par poocha gaya to unhone yah kehete hue line kaat di ki 'jo man chaahe, vah likho

 bharat ke purv spinner maninder singh kaa maananaa he ki spinner aar aswin kaa kariyar team management kii galati ke chalate kharaab ho rahaa he
 He said that the management is not handling it properly and due to this he has become a very defensive bowler
 gauratlab he ki kharaab form se jujh rahe aswin asia cap ke pehle match main bangladesh ke khilaaf nae ection ke saath gendbaaji karte najar aae the
 Speaking to a cricket website, Maninder said, Ashwin is trying many variations
 jab aap bahut kuch aajamaane kii koshish karte hai to apni moulikta kho dete hai or yahi ho rahaa he, jisase main chintit hum
 He said, i think Ashwin is the match winner
 vah test, vanade yaa tii20 main jita saktaa he lekin use sahi tareeke se handle nahin kiya gaya
 i do not understand what the bowling coach, head coach and captain are doing to him
 yadi main hota to uski gendbaaji ko is tarah bigadane nahin detaa ki use ection badalanaa pade
 The fastest 100 Test wickets Ashwin Nemininder's concern is justified because the fastest bowler who took 100 Test wickets in the last 80 years, Ashwin flopped on the Indian team's tour of South Africa and New Zealand
 maninder ne kaha, kisi ko use bataanaa chahie ki use bhartiya team main isliye rakhaa gaya kyonki usne ipel jaise 20 overon ke cricket main wicket lene kii tatparta dikhaai thi
 "I came to the Test team after that and after last year's Australia series, i read somewhere that he said that my job is to stop runs," said Thakramaninder
 use yah kisne kaha
 By the captain
 unhone kaha, mujhe lagata he ki use sahi tareeke se handle nahin kiya gaya
 Someone was picked in the Indian team because he had the urge to take wickets and was also taking wickets in 20 overs cricket, but in Test cricket where he needed to take wickets, he became a defensive bowler
 kuch to gadabad hua he
 Someone is giving him the wrong opinion
 purv spinner ne kaha ki aswin ko apane karier ko dharre par laane ke liye achche coach kii jarurat he
 Congress General Secretary Manish Tiwari may have publicly regretted his comments against Anna Hazare but it has not had any impact on the Gandhian
 hajaare ne tiwari ko kanoonee notice bhejkar unhen ‘upar se neeche tak’ bhrasht bataane par is pravaktaa se likhit main maafee maangane ke liye kaha he
 Hazare's advocate Milind Pawar sent notices to Tiwari by e-mail and post on Gandhian instructions
 pavaar ne isse pehle kaha tha ki congressi saansad ke khilaaf pune kii adaalat main manahani mukadmaa darj karaayaa jayega
 The notice sent to Tiwari demanded that you write a letter of apology on behalf of yourself and your party, promising not to repeat the false stigmas and defamatory statements in the future (about Hazare)
 ’isamen kaha gaya ki congressi netaa ne hajaare ke bare main manahani vaale bayaan dekar ipisi kii dhaaraon 499 or 500 ke tahat aparaadh kiya he
 Significantly, Tiwari had targeted Hazare citing the Sawant Commission report and accused him of 'indulging in corruption from top to bottom'
 tiwari ne kaha tha ki saavant ayog ne hajaare ko bhrashtachar main upar se neeche tak lipt paaya he
 The Congress leader regretted his comments after facing a lot of criticism for attacking Hazare
 tiwari apni tippaniyon kii vajah se kai din tak tivi camaron se gaayab ho gayi the
 He had said, 'I know that some of my recent statements have hurt Hazare
 mujhe iske liye khed he or main is desh ke ek naagarik ke rup main unase apana anshan khatm karne kii apil karata hum
 Pawar said the Congress spokesperson has also been asked to clarify whether what he said is his personal view or his party's view
 unhone kaha ki agar tiwari likhit maafee nahin maangate hai to unke khilaaf ‘divaani or faujadaari adaalat’ main kanoonee karrwai shuru kii jaaegi
 Not 3 but 6 bullets were fired on Gitanjali
 ye kahana he gudgaanv police kaa or is nae khulaase ke baad gudgaanv ke sijeem ravanit garg kii patni gitanjali kii murder mistry or bhi gaharaa gai he
 Four days have passed since the murder of Gitanjali
 lekin police abhi bhi kaatil ke suraag dhundh rahi he
 And that's why the police on Sunday morning reconstructed the murder scene of Gitanjali at the exact same place in the same park where Gitanjali's body was found in the evening of 17 July
 chunki gitanjali kaa katl police lines ke isi park main hua tha or makatool gudgaanv ke sijeem kii patni thi lihaaja police bhi fouran harakat main ai or katl kii is gutthi ko sulajhane ke liye har angel se is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The biggest disclosure in this case of murder was that the murderer had fired not three, but 6 bullets on Gitanjali
 police lines main amuman har vakt sannaate kaa maahaul rahata he
 But the amazing thing is that no one heard any sound of firing
 yahaan tak ki park main tahal rahe logon tak ko nahin
 The police is also investigating whether Gitanjali was murdered elsewhere
 And after the murder, was the corpse brought to this place in the bush? According to police sources, it is not so easy to fire three at someone in the park inside the police lines
 kyonki dekhne or pakade jane kaa puraa khatra he
 Therefore, the possibility that the murder may have taken place elsewhere and the corpse was later brought and kept here
 iske alaava police is baat kii bhi tafteesh kar rahi he ki kaatil ne maukey par pistaul kyon chhod di
 The police have not yet found the kiosks of the bullets, the police is also looking for them
 itnaa hi nahin teen goliyon ke alaava gitanjali ke sir par gahare chot ke nishaan bhi mili hai
 That is, there was hatha-pie with Gitanjali before the murder
 phir danda yaa kisi duusari cheez se uske sir par waar kiya gaya
 It is obvious that by entering into the police lines, in this way, a wife of a CJM can be murdered in public park who is well aware of the environment inside the police lines
 agar usne katl park main kiya tab bhi or laash laakar park main phenki tab bhi
 At present, the police have sent CGM pistol to CFSL lab and are awaiting the report
 philhal gitanjali kii murder mistry kai ansulajhe sawaalon main lipati he
 There are many questions and the police is looking for answers to these questions
 or apni isi koshish main police sijeem ravanit garg samet unke rishtedaaron se poochtacha kii
 And after this inquiry, the police also seized two laptops of Ravneet Garg
 sijim ravanit garg kii patni gitanjali ke katl se jude ye wo sawaal hai jinhen gudgaanv police pichley 4 din se sulajhane kii koshish main lagi he
 But the police have not found any clue of the murderer yet
 is maamle main police sijim ranvit garg se shanivaar ko kareeb saadhe chaar ghante tak poochtacha kar chuki he
 Gitanjali's family members were also present during the interrogation
 gudgaanv police kii esaiti team ne jaj ravanit garg se gudgaanv ke civil line main unke sarkari awaas kothi nambar 10 main unke samet unke ke rishtedaaron se bhi poochtacha kii
 After questioning, the police seized two laptops of Ravneet Garg, his revolver case and a box
 poochtacha ke dauraan gudgaanv police ne sijim ravanit garg se gitanjali kii maut se jude kai sawaal kiye
 There are many unresolved questions in the case such as where was he in the evening between 5 am and 7 pm at the time of the murder
 , kiske saath the? is dauraan unhone phone par kisase kisase baat kii? wo apana revolver kahaan rakhte the? kya gitanzil roj revolver lekar tahalne jaati thi? betiyon ke hone se kya wo naakhush the? kya aapane kabhi gitanjali se bete kii ichha jaahir kii thi? kya donon main kya akasar anban rahati thi? wo do log koun hai jinpar jaj ne katl kaa shaq jaahir kiya he
 What enmity can Ravneet or Gitanjali hold with both of them? Didn't Geetanjil carry her mobile everyday? Where was Gitanjali's mobile on the day of the murder? Did the revolver always keep loaded or kept the cartridges separate at home? Did Gitanjali ever mention enmity to anyone? a court ruling that led to the murder of someone killed by his wife Gitanjali? On the other hand, Gitanjali's family members alleged that Hina, a relative of Ravneet, had told them that Hina had eaten at around 4 am on the day of Gitanjali incident but postmortem The report found no food from Gitanjali's stomach
 yahi nahin gitanjali kii maa ne jab 17 july ko shaam saat baje phone kiya to phone hina ne uthaaya tha or hina ne unase kaha tha kii gitanjali abhi kuch der pehle market gai he or jaise hi wo waapas aegi to wo gitanjali kii baat unase kara degi
 Police is now investigating the phone call details of both Geetanjali and Ravneet Garg
 mumkin he ki phone kol main hi chipa ho gitanjali kii maut kaa raaj
 Although the family members of Gijantali believe that husband Ravneet is behind the death of Gitanjali, the judge's family is denying the allegations
 gitanjali ke parivaar ne 19 july ko ravanit garg ke khilaaf exiaar darj karai thi jisame unhone aarope lagaaya he ki jaj ko bete kii chahat thi lekin 2 beti hone kii vajah se unka gitanjali se rishta talkh ho gaya tha
 But Ravneet's family has been denying it directly
 Gitanjali and Ravneet Garg were married in 2007, but Gitanjali's family has also alleged that the daughter was being persecuted for dowry
 jaj ke parivaar ne is aarope kaa bhi khandan kiya he
 Since the case is related to the judge and his wife and is currently in the news, the police is investigating it from every angle
 ummid he ki jald hi gitanjali kii maut se judi ek ek gutthi ke taar khulne lagenge
 Kitankshetra University MBA topper Geetanjali used to raise the voice of women's rights in her own style
 kavita ke jariye
 What did Gitanjali know then that in three months she would be the victim of the same excesses against which she was voicing her struggle
 ye vahi gitanjali he- gudgaanv ke chif judicial magistrate ravanit garg kii patni, jiskaa 17 july kaa katl ho gaya tha
 Geetanjali's death, which raises the question of women's rights and existence, is wrapped in a shroud of questions
 gitanjali kii hatya puure parivaar ke liye jindagi bhar kaa nasoor ban gai he
 Now this murder case is going out of the threshold of the police station and going to the court
 insaaf kii devi ye tay karengi ki aadhi aabaadi ko taqatvar banane ke daur main kisi gitanjali kaa katl kisne kiya or kyon

 There is no halt in the helicopter or there is no helicopter, but there is no rumor in the rallies

 The condition of the cameraman Mohammed began to deteriorate
 mujhe bhi lag rahaa tha ki kuch gadabad ho rahaa he
 It felt like the sugar was down

 Narendra Modi has made the level of rallies so grand that people have forgotten that election meetings also take place
 narendra modi kii raily kii tarah koi intazaam nahin
 No media camera
 koi obi vine nahin
 Whereas today, some part of all Modi's rallies in Bihar must have gone on the channels
 lalu, mayawati, mulaayam or nitish kii sirf bite chalati he
 Only Modi, Rahul, Sonia and Priyanka go live
 lalu kii sabha kaa intazaam aisa tha jaise raste main baraat kaa intazaam ho
 There is no sparkle
 press ko sanbhaalane vaala koi manager nahin
 There were no hundred people even before the helicopter appeared in Lalu's assembly
 jaise hi helicopter dikhaai diya pataa nahin kahan se paanch minute ke bheetar sabha sthal bhar gaya
 Do not understand where so many people came from
 jabaki thik usee vakt chhapra main modi kii raily chal rahi thi

 modi ne khud ko badlaav ke agent ke rup main pesh kar diya he
 There is no candidate on the other side to challenge this claim
 duusari taraf se modi kii tarah koi sapana nahin bechaa gaya he
 Therefore, it seems powerful to stop Modi with the help of caste or regional parties, but all the arguments are based on the old formula
 ye narendra modi ke paksh main he yaa nahin magar is chunaav main raajnneetik saamaajik sambandhon main vyapak badlaav ho rahaa he
 One of the wonders of the BJP or the Sangh is that it has equipped its supporters with aggressive arguments at every square intersection
 kisi kii raily main jaataa hoon to ye log camere ke paas aakar modi modi karne lagate hai
 Strongly argues
 mujhe bijepi kii raily main koi sapai yaa congressi nahin miltaa magar baaqiyon kii raily main badlaav yaa modi modi karne vaala yuva zarur miltaa he
 Now i have started asking if it is a volunteer or a relative of a BJP leader

 Before they do Modi, the crowd is talking something else, but suddenly the crowd starts sorting due to the arrival of such elements

 He who knows the politics of Bihar will automatically understand the meaning of this picture

 RJD leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav arrived in Katihar on Friday evening in order to start the Constitution Save Justice Yatra
 katihaar main apane raatri pravaas ke dauraan tejasvi yadav kursela prakhand ke balathi maheshpur dalit tolaa gaye, jahaan unhone ek mahadalit parivaar ke ghar raat kaa bhojan kiya
 Doman Ram arrived at Mahadalit's house at around 8:30 pm on Tuesday evening and took stock of the situation in his house
 tejasvi ne sabase pehle shouch karne kii ichha jataai or domen ram ke ghar ke baahar bane shauchalay main pahunch gaye, lekin shauchalay kii haalat dekhakar unhone bihar sarkaar ko jamkar kosa
 Tejashwi said that the Bihar government and the central government are spending crores of rupees to build toilets, but even then Mahadalits like Doman Ram had to build toilets with their own money
 ye shauchalay bhi puraa nahin bana he, kyonki isamen darwaja nahin he
 After this, Tejashwi went to the mud house of Doman Rama
 tejasvi ghar kii haalat dekhakar nitish sarkaar par baras pade or kaha ki indira awaas yojana ke tahat sarkaar garibon ko makaan banane ke liye paise detii he, lekin vah paise domen ram jaise garibon ko nahin pahunchataa he
 After this, Tejaswi asked Doman Ram whether tap water comes in his house or electricity
 iske jawaab main domen ram ne kaha ki yah donon chijen bhi unke ghar par ab tak uplabdh nahin hui hai
 On this, Tejashwi said that despite the government of double engine in Bihar and Center, nothing is being done for the poor
 isaki vajah se nandan gaanv jaisi ghatnaayen ho rahi hai, jahaan par mahadaliton ne nitish kumaar par naaraazgi jataate hue unke kafile par kuch din pehle hamalaa kiya tha
 After this, Tejashwi had dinner with local MLA and colleagues sitting on the ground at Doman Ram's house
 bhojan main tejasvi ko puri, aalu gobhi kii sabji or chaaval kaa kheer parosa gaya
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Tejashwi Yadav said that for the last 12 years Nitish Kumar has been claiming that development work has been done in Bihar
 khaskar garib or mahadaliton ke liye hue vikaas kii padtaal karne ke liye vah mahadalit tolaa main pahunche the
 Significantly, in his short political life till now, Tejashwi Yadav has never eaten at any Mahadalit's house
 jab unase poocha gaya ki aisa karne ke liye unhen kisne prerit kiya to tejasvi ne kaha, unhone yah sab apane pita lalu prasad se siikhaa he
 Earlier, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and BJP National President Amit Shah have also visited Dalits at their home on several occasions
 ab is kadi main tejasvi yadav kaa bhi naam jud gaya he
 Talking till date, Tejashwi said that during his Nyay Yatra, he will raise the issue of ignoring and not giving special state status
 unhone kaha ki vah nitish kumaar or bhaajapa ke bich santhganth or bihar main vikaas kaary nahin hone ke mudde ko bhi janata ke bich lekar jaaenge
 On the other hand, Mahadalit Doman Ram said that he is very happy about Tejashwi Yadav coming to his house and having food and now hopes that his family will be well
 dilachasp baat yah he ki, argedy ko ab tak mukhya rup main yadavon or musalamaanon kii party ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, jabaki dalit or mahadalit par nitish kumaar ke party kii pakad thi
 But in Nandan village of Buxar, the way Mahadalits attacked Nitish Kumar's convoy last month for the lack of development work in their area has been raising the issue of Dalits and Mahadalits since then
 yahi nahin,nitishake kafile par hamale ke kuch din baad tejasvi yadav mahadaliton par hue pulisia atyaachaar ko lekar nandan gaanv bhi pahunche the
 Now before starting the Nyaya Yatra, he has tried to reshape his politics by having food at Mahadalit's house
 ovaisi ne kaha, bhagwat mob linching rokane kii baat nahin kar raheowaisi ne poocha, mob linching ke peediton ko maala kisne pahanaaiol india majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin (AIMIM) ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi ne rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) pramukh mohan bhagwat par hamalaa bolaa he
 Hyderabad MP Owaisi said on Mohan Bhagwat's statement on mob lynching that the ideology that killed Mahatma Gandhi and Tabrez cannot bring much disrepute to India
 ovaisi ne kaha,mohan bhagwatlinching kii ghatnaon par roak lagane kii baat nahin kah rahe hai, balki wo ye kah rahe hai ki ise linching na kaha jaae
 Let us know that while addressing the volunteers on the occasion of Vijayadashmi on Tuesday, Mohan Bhagwat said that kimob lynching is a western method and should not be used in the context of India to discredit the country
 The victims were Indians
 Who garlanded convicts? Who draped them in 🇮🇳? We've a Godse loving BJP MP
 There can’t be a bigger defamation of India than ideology that killed Gandhi / Tabrez
 Bhagwat isn't saying stop lynching, he's saying 'don't call it that'https: / / t

 gandhi auratbrejki hatya karne vaali jo vichaardhaara he usase badi badanaami bharat kii nahin ho sakati
 Bhagwat is not saying a ban on lynching, he is saying that it should not be called lynching
 ovaisi kaa bada hamalaovasi ne bid main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue aarope lagaaya ki 2014 ke baad se bharat main mob linching kii ghatana bad rahi he, vah bhi jaanboojhkar kii gai maansikta ke saath
 He said that if Mohan Bhagwat says that mob lynching has no relation with India, then i want to remind him
 
 
 mob linchingka is desh ke saath sambandh he
 
 
 
 indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad jis tarah se sikh samudaay ke logon ko maaraa gaya, vah bhi mob linching tha
 Owaisi said, if they (mohan Bhagwat) want to say that mob lynching has no relation with India, then i want to ask them what happened in 2002 in Gujarat
 
 
 agar mohan bhagwat kehete hai ki mob linching se koi sambandh nahin he to bhagwat ko vaise logon ko,godseki maansikta vaale logon ko rokna chahie jinhone tabrej kii hatya kii
 
 
 Those who killed Tabrez Ansari were welcomed by the BJP minister
 isliye jab tak aisi hatyaein hoti rahengi, bharat main mob linching bana rahegaa

 PM Modi has once again targeted the Congress
 shanivaar ko piem ne kaha ki congress ke liye rashtriya suraksha or raksha kshetra tiraskrit kshetra (panching bag) yaa phir dhan ekatra karne ke strot he
 The PM said during a video conferencing meeting with Tamil Nadu BJP workers that Congress leaders use abuses for army chiefs on the one hand and make fun of surgical strikes, while on the other hand they took the jeep scam in the 1940s and 50s From the 1980s to Bofors, agustawestland and plundered the country by carrying out submarine scams and other scams

 PM Modi: Sadly, for Congress, national security and defense sector is either a punching bag or a funding source
 On one hand, the leaders called Army chief names & mocked surgical strikes
 On the other, they looted the defense sector, from the jeep scam back in the 40s & 50s, (1 / 2) pic

 PM Modi was shocked to see all this happen suddenly
 haalanki, iske baad jate hue rahul gandhi ko piem ne roka or unhone bhi rahul se pehle haath milaayaa phir unhen gale se lagaaya
 During this, he also talked about Rahul but due to lack of records, he could not come in front of everyone

 He explained the meaning of being Indian

 You have hatred for me, inside you is angry for me, for you i am Pappu

 Last week, Nationalist Congress Party President Sharad Pawar had demanded a loan waiver after taking stock of the public crisis and drought situation in Pune

 " ab maharashtra sarkaar ke sutara sanket de rahe hai ki pavaar somvaar ko is masale par mukhyamantri se milakar charchaa karne vaale hai
 This situation is also serious because the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has already announced the delay in arrival of monsoon and in its previous announcement has given the date of June 6 for the monsoon off the coast of Kerala
 isamen kamibeshi ke bare main june ke pehle hafte main iemdi apadet degaa
 Meanwhile, according to the Ministry of Water Resources, a total of 21 percent water is left in the 91 reservoirs of the country

 According to the ministry, this is higher than last year
 lekin desh ke uttari ilaake yani punjab, himachalay punjab or rajasthan ke 6 jalaashyon main 44 fisadi pani bachaa he
 Last year it was 15 per cent
 desh ke purvi ilaake main yani jharkhand, odisha, pashchim bengal or tripura main kul 15 jalashay hai
 Of these, 24 per cent of the total capacity is water, which is 4 per cent less than last year
 sabase dikkat pashchimi ilaake main he yani gujarat or maharashtra main
 There is 12 percent water left in the total capacity in the 27 reservoirs here, which was 16 percent last year
 monsoon aane main deree ke bainks yah kami gambhir maani ja rahi he
 Especially in Marathwada region, this shortage is noticeable as only 3 percent water is left in the reservoirs and experts are saying that now the water supply can be stopped for irrigation from these dams
 vajahah ilaake ke 9 main se 8 jalashyo main pani kaa stock shunya ho chukaa he
 Dead stock remains for use only in the Jayakwadi reservoir
 philhal ilaake main 4,331 gaanvon main kareeb 6 hajaar tankeron se pani kii aapurti kii ja rahi he
 In the central region of the country, 26 percent water is left in the reservoirs
 jabaki desh ke dakshini hisson main bhi mahaj 12 fisadi pani bachaa hua he
 However, the Meteorological Department has said that at present, the El Niño which is affecting the monsoon is in the equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean and it is weak at the moment
 aisi sthiti kuch dinon tak bani rahegi or dhire-dhire al nino kamjor hota jayega
 By the middle of July, the monsoon will return to its tone

 On Thursday, two of the most successful captains of Indian cricket history - Sourav Ganguly and Mahendra Singh Dhoni - will face off with their respective teams for the 24th league match of the fifth edition of the Indian Premier League at the Chidambaram Stadium
 ganguli pune warirs india ke captain hai jabaki dhoni do baar ipel or ek baar champions lig khitaab jeet chuki chennai super kings kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 Given the leadership and success of both in international cricket, this match will be quite interesting from the strategic perspective
 pune warirs ke nae ghar-subrat roy sahaara stadium main ganguli kii team ne dhoni ko patkhni di thi
 In such a situation, Dhoni would like to equalize the defeat by defeating Pune Warriors while playing in his house
 maujuuda champions super kings kii haalat nau tiimon kii talika main thik nahin he
 He has played five matches so far and has won only two
 teen main use haar mili he
 He is ranked sixth in the table
 jahaan tak pune warirs kii baat he to use apane pichley match main royal chalangers ke khilaaf antim gend par haar mili thi lekin yah match puri tarah barabari kaa rahaa tha or ise ganguli kii team ke hausale par koi asar nahin padaa hoga
 The defeat changed the equation of the points table for Pune but they can make up for it by defeating the Super Kings
 pune kii team philhal nau tiimon kii talika main teen jeet or do haar ke saath tisare kram par he, jo ek sukhad sthiti kahi ja sakati he

 com / clhkegfygg paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey saamne aane ke baad desh ke do or rajyon se congress saaf ho gai
 In Uttarakhand, where it was cleared, it could not form a government despite being the largest party in Manipur
 haalanki punjab main party ko behtareen jeet mili lekin upi main karaari haar or usase pehle desh ke alag-alag vidhansabha chunaavon ke nateezon ke baad kaha jane laga he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa congress mukt bharat kaa sapana saakaar hota ja rahaa he
 However, if we look at these results from a different perspective, the picture looks a bit different
 darasal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad agar goa or manipur jaise chote rajyon ko chhod diya jaae to 10 pradeshon maharashtra, jharkhand, bihar, dilli, pashchim bengal, tamilnadu, kerala, assam, uttar pradesh or punjab main vidhansabha chunaav hue hai
 These states account for 60 per cent of the total Lok Sabha seats i
e
 317 out of 543 seats
 dada drivan website india spend ke mutabik 2014 caloksabhaa chunaav main congresane 1544 vidhansabha siton par chunaav ladaa (loksabhaa kshetron ke antargat) or in 10 rajyon main use 194 par hi jeet mil saki yani uski safalataa kii pratishat mahaj 13 rahaa
 However, when the assembly elections were held in these states after the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress fielded its candidates in 1032 assembly seats and out of these 258 candidates also won, i
e
 its success percentage increased from 13 to 25
 sirf siton kii sankhya hi doguni nahin hui balki 2014 main in rajyon main jahaan use 20 fisadi vot mili to vidhansabha chunaavon main 30 fisadi vot lekar wo apana pradarshan sudhaarney main safal rahi
 Talking about vote share, the Congress secured more votes than the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab
 haalanki congress kaa ye kathith acha pradarshan bahut kuch uske alag-alag partiyon ke saath gathbandhan kaa bhi nateeja rahaa lekin ye bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa ki agar congress akele chunaav ladati to uskaa vot share isse kam hota hi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has implemented his cabinet expansion on Sunday
 inamen nae 9 chehron ko shaamil kiya gaya
 Apart from this, 4 ministers have been promoted to cabinet ministers
 pichley dinon isi madde najar kai mantriyon ne istife die hai
 It also includes Kalraj Mishra, considered a Brahmin face of UP, who has resigned from his ministerial post
 calraj mishra ko rajyapal banaae jane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 If this happens, Tokalraj Mishra will also have to resign from the Deoria Lok Sabha seat
 is bahaane upi ke vipaksh ko ek bada mauka mil saktaa he, jahaan apni siyaasi takat ko dobaaraa se ubhaar saken
 Especially to BSP chief Mayawati and Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav
 darasal yogiaditnath ke upi ke CM bananeke baad gorakhpur loksabhaa seat or keshav maury ke dipti siem banane ke baad unki phulpur loksabhaa seat khaali ho rahi he
 Because both the leaders are taking the party in the house through MLC
 calraj mishra ko agar rajyapal banaaya jaataa he, to unhen bhi apni seat devaria chhodani padhegi
 In this way, there will be by-elections in three Lok Sabha seats
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi upi kii 71 siton par jeet kaa paracham laharaaya tha
 In fact, there will be a big chance for the opposition after the debacle in the Lok Sabha 2014 and Vidhan Sabha 2017 elections
 is bich maaya-akhilesh milakar upachunaav ladane kii baat bhi baar-baar uthati rahi he
 In such a situation, if there is an agreement between the two, then winning for the BJP can prove to be a crook
 is tarah 2019 ke liye narendra modi or amit shah jo maahaul banane chaahate hai, unke liye bada jhatka bhi lag saktaa he
 Now you understand how much time you have to spend at a house in the General Assembly? " On May 1, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked this question with a relaxed smile, departing the members of the Mahasampark Campaign team, including BJP President Amit Shah, who met at his official residence at 7 Racecourse, everyone nodded with a soft smile
 lamps
 darasal, yah pradhanmantri kaa party ko ek sandesh tha jis par unhone khud amal karke dikhaaya tha
 As the first member of the BJP, after completing the formalities of a few minutes, while feeding the gram-sprouts at the breakfast table, Modi began a discussion with all the leaders about his family which reached politics and the country
 halki-phulki baton ke saath sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par gambhir charchaa karte hue dedh ghanta kab biit gaya, pataa hi nahin chalaa
 So when the Prime Minister finally asked the question, his heart was understood by Shah's warlords
 lekin us vakt tak bijepi ne shaayad hi yah sochaa tha ki modi lahar ke baad bane nae sadasyon kaa ghar dhundhna mushkil ho jayega
 In fact, the exercise to increase mass base by riding on technology is overshadowing the party and now it has renamed the old methods of membership campaign as the mass campaign
 amit shah ne 10 karod sadsy banane ke lakshya ke saath 1 nanvabar, 2014 ko mahasadasyata abhiyaan shuru kiya or april 2015 tak party ne lakshya paar karne kaa bharosa jataate hue duniya kii sabase badi rajnatik party hone kaa daawa bhi kiya, lekin jab is aankade par andeh jataayaa jane laga to party ne sabhi sadasyon se ghar-ghar jaakar sampark karne or unhen party kii vichaardhaara se jodgaye ke liye prashikshan dene kii tihari ranneeti banaai
 
 
 
 par aankadon main ulajh gai bijepilekin bijepi kii is ranneeti ko us samay jhatka laga jab sadsyta abhiyaan main missd kol ke jariye jude 10-11 karod logon main se chaar karod kaa koi ata-pataa nahin tha
 Most of them were those who gave missed calls, but did not send their names and addresses to the party through SMS
 mahasampark abhiyaan se jude rashtriya mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey kehete hai, “shuruyaat main 30 se 40 fisadi aankade nahin mil paa rahe the, par hamane peshewar logon ko jodakar sthiti ko thik kar liya he
 "but in the Uttar Pradesh for which he is handling the responsibility of the mass campaign, 1 also
 86 karod sadasyon main se sirf 1
 56 crore numbers were found correct and the number of members with correct names and addresses was 10 million
 haalanki upi ke ek varisht netaa kaa daawa he ki rajya main 50 lakh form jamaa ho chuke hai or missd kol main bhi pradesh baaki rajyon se aage he
 The reality of the membership campaign, which BJP was filling up on the success of the membership campaign, increased its heartbeat
 sutron ke mutabik, bijepi netritv ko jab yah laga ki aankadon ke gadabadjhaale se duniya kii sabase badi party hone kaa uskaa tamgaa chhin saktaa he to party ne centre main apni satta kaa bharpoor istemaal kiya
 a senior BJP leader explains, “we also got help from the government in finding the address of the members
 mantralay ke jariye mobile seva pradaata companiyon ko mobile number dekar logon ke pate nikalwaaye
 "obtained private information privately from mobile companies and also drafted the General Assembly according to the telecom circle
" iske alaava party ne iity, iiem se jude peshewaron ko bhi is kaam main joda, jinhone website khangaalin or bijepi karyaalay se har us number par phone kiye jiskaa naam-pataa record main nahin tha
 Despite this, BJP is just 1 out of four crore
 20 karod logon ko dhund pai
 Recently, the party's national vice-president Shyam Jaju, who is associated with this campaign, says, "today we have clear data of 8-9 crores, there are figures around the remaining three crores which are having some difficulty in finding it
 ”aakhir kya he deree kii vajahamahasampark abhiyaan kii miyaad 31 july ko khatm ho chuki he, lekin abhi yah puraa hota nahin dikh rahaa
 The party first started this campaign with its active activists, who had met the criteria of making 100 ordinary members required to become active members
 lekin yahaan bhi party ko dikkaton ko saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, after the victory in the general election, the BJP launched a big campaign to make people members in zeal
 iske tahat gali, nukkad, chauraahon, train, bas aadi sabhi jagahon par logon se missd kol karwaanaa shuru kar diya gaya
 As one of the bjp's district level worker says, "when we camped there were people from nearby states who got missed calls but due to technical reasons there was delay in sending SMS
 vah aankada sambandhit pradesh main jamaa ho gaya or ab mahasampark ke liye mila to pataa chalaa ki yah number kisi duusare rajya kaa he
 “many activists had both the names and numbers, but it turned out that there is no person named such and such at that place
 dakgharon ke pin code se bhi kuch jagahon par data mix ho gaye
 As Jaju himself points out, confusion has developed with the names of some places, for example, Aurangabad is both Bihar and Maharashtra
 punjab-haryana kaa data bhi pin code kii vajah se mix ho gaya
 The BJP is blaming technical reasons for the delay, but the logic of the activists working at the basic level is something else
 sadsyta abhiyaan kii shuruyaat main bijepi ke paksh main maahaul acha tha, lekin dilli vidhansabha chunaav kii haar se sthiti badal gai
 Apart from this, there is a situation of tiredness due to continuous work from the workers
 bijepi ne sadsyta ke fouran baad mahasampark or phir mahaprashikshan shivi lagane kaa kaam shuru kar diya
 BJP General Secretary Saroj Pandey, who is associated with the General Assembly, says, “the work of the General Assembly is in progress after achieving the goal of general membership
 lekin yah sach he ki isamen kuch vilamb hua he
 "she explains that the reason for the delay is the organizational work as well as the election of some states and the beginning of training classes with this campaign
 saroj daawa karti hai ki yah lakshya sau fisadi puraa hoga
 This will take six years! The BJP may be claiming to correct the figures and achieve the target of the General Assembly, but the party 10 despite the end of the deadline
 91 karod main sirf 40 lakh logon tak pahunch pai he
 The party has set a new deadline till September
 lekin india today ko mili aankade bataate hai ki maujuuda sthiti main party ek din main ausatan 45-50 hajaar logon tak hi pahunch paa rahi he
 This is the situation when BJP leaders are claiming that the campaign has gained momentum
 agar bijepi ke is pradarshan ko bhi paimaana maan liya jaae to bhi use apane sabhi sadasyon ke gharon tak pahunchane main chah saal or lag jaaenge
 a senior UP leader says, "the party initially made a slight lapse
 agar sadsyta abhiyaan ke saath hi data rajya ikaayiyon se saajha kiya jaataa to itani samasya nahin aati
 The lump sum data has also increased the burden on the workers and many numbers are no longer available
 ”party bhi is mushkil ko samajhane lagi he
 All state units have been instructed by the central leadership that no one will be rested until the goal is achieved
 lekin is abhiyaan kii safalataa ko lekar bijepi ne bachaao kii ranneeti par kaam shuru kar diya he
 BJP General Secretary Arun Singh, who is responsible for membership campaign figures, dismisses the question of delay in the General Assembly
 ve kehete hai, “sanghathan main sakriy sadsyta kii ek prakriya he or 100 sadsy banane vaale hi is shrenee main aate hai
 a hundred members have to fill it in a form and submit it at the mandal level and two officials at the district level verify it, only then one becomes an active member
 kul milakar aise kaaryakartaaon kii sankchaya 6
 5-7 lakhs
 yani november 2014 se april 2015 tak kareeb 6-7 karod sadasyon se sampark ho chukaa he or is mahasampark abhiyaan ko aap punaru sampark sthapit karne kii prakriya kah sakate hai
 "his argument on the question of delay in the current campaign is," we took the membership campaign forward for the first time in a scientific and systematic manner
 lekin mahasampark abhiyaan main bhi missd kol dena he, isko lekar kuch logon ko bhram ho gaya
 Therefore missed calls could not come in as many numbers as the number of forms are assembled
 ”janaadhar badhaane kaa “vargeekaran” formuliamit shah ne haal hi main bengaluru main kaha tha ki mahasampark abhiyaan main bijepi sabhi 10 karod sadasyon tak pahonchegi or unhen party ke vijan ke bare main bataaegi
 Not only this, BJP will have the data of all these members
 lekin sutron ke mutabik, party ne ab un sadasyon tak hi pahunchane kii ranneeti banaai he jin tak pahunchnaa sahaj ho paaegaa kyonki tamaam kasaraton ke baavjood uske paas abhi tak sabhi sadasyon ke bare main mukammal jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 The party has now adopted the formula for classifying members
 yani sakriy sadasyon ke alaava ek shrenee sampark ho chuke sadasyon kii or jin tak pahunch paanaa sambhav nahin ho paa rahaa, unhen alag shrenee main rakhaa jayega
 But the BJP will not exclude those numbers which it cannot reach
 pandeya kahati hai, “bijepi kaa number dial karne vaala har sadsy hamaari vichaardhaara se prabhavit hokar aayaa he isliye vah hamaare saath judaa rahegaa
 This means that this category will be a voter after BJP for voters, whom the BJP is unable to make its worker due to technical reasons
 lekin shah party kaa janaadhar badhaane ke apane lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye alag-alag prayog bhi kar rahe hai
 In the membership drive, seven states & Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar and Rajasthan achieved the target of more than one crore and now a central officer has been posted in these states separately for the General Assembly
 iske alaava shah ne sadsyta abhiyaan ke samay saat rajyon&tamilnadu, andhra pradesh, telugana, kerala, assam, orissa or pashchim bengal par focus kiya tha jahaan sadasyon kii sankhya badi he
 But the position of the General Assembly is not as good
 sakriy sadasyon kii sankhya main ijapha karne ke liye party un logon ko bhi sakriy sadsy kii suchi main shaamil karne ja rahi he jo kisi khaas kshetra main dakshata rakhte hai or apni seva dene ke liye kuch samay de sakate hai
 Therefore, in addition to 6-7 lakh active members, a massive training campaign of 15 lakh people has been started by adding the same number of new members
 sitambar main har roj 500 prashikshan shivi yojit honge
 With the new experiments, the membership of BJP has increased from 3 crore to 10 crore
 lekin mahasampark abhiyaan ko paimaana banaaya jaae to yah sankhya 6-7 karod ke aasapaas hi rahegi
 In such a situation, will BJP be able to maintain the record of being the largest party in the world? congress ke baagi saansad vaai es jaganmohan reddy ko aade haathon lete hue kendriya mantri evam rajya se party ke varisht netaa es jaipal reddy ne kaha ki vah party anushaasan kaa ulanghan kar rahe hai or unki gatividhiyaan ‘avaanchit’ hai
 Reddy said that the Jagan-owned Sakshi channel, through its programs, is weakening the party by targeting Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi
 mantri ne sakshi channel ke kaaryakramon ke sambandh main puche gaye prashn kaa uttar dete hue kaha, ‘sabhi log jaanate hai ki yah channel unka (jagan) he or iskaa prasaaran vah apni raajnneeti ke liye kar rahe hai
 This channel is being misused to weaken the party
 yah avaanchit he
 Reddy said that Jagan's father YSR Reddy, the late Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, was completely loyal to the Congress but his young sons are very active but seem misguided
 yah puche jane par ki kya yuva saansad ke khilaaf karrwai kiye jane kii sambhaavna he, reddy ne kaha, ‘jagan party anushaasan kaa ulanghan kar rahe hai to swabhaavik taur par is sambandh main nirnay party ke rashtriya str par kiya jaayegaa
 The Union Minister's remarks came at a time when Andhra Pradesh's newly appointed Chief Minister n Kiran Kumar Reddy is scheduled to meet Congress President Sonia Gandhi to finalize the names of cabinet colleagues
 congress ne isse pehle sakshi televijan par prasaarit kaarykram ke bare main party kii pradesh ikai se report maangi thi jisamen congress adhyaksh or pradhanmantri kii aalochana kii gai thi
 After receiving the report a few days ago, Congress state in-charge and Law Minister Veerappa Miley termed it a serious matter
 baharhaal, baagi congress saansad ne shuukravaar ko vidhayakon samet apane samarthakon ke saath kai baithken kii thi taaki aage kii disha tay kii ja sake

 The shoe rack is a part of the small things that we use almost every day
 ghar ke ek kone main rakhe shu rack par hamaara dhyaan kabhi-kabhi hi ja paata he
 Keeping the shoe rack clean keeps the shoes and slippers in it protected from dirt
 ghar ek kone main rakhaa shu rack agar saaf suthra hoga to ghar kii shobhaa ko kharaab karne se bhi bachaa rahegaa
 Come, know, keep the important part of both your footwear and home in such a way, save with some easy tips
 - shu rack ko aisi jagah rakhen jahaan par dhul mitti kam aati ho taaki ise roj saaf karne kii jarurat na pade
 - If the shoe rack is of wood, always keep in mind that the wood is polished so that the wood remains from the termites
 - roj nahin to hafte main ek baar shu rack ko jarur saaf karen
 You can also bring a shoe rack cleaning kit available in the market if you want
 - shu rack agar lohe kaa he to ise zyada pani sesaf karne se bachein
 There is a risk of rust in this
 - shu rack kii safai se bachane ke liye cabinet shu rack kaa istemaal karnaa phaayde kaa sauda rahata he
 - If the number of members in the house is more then two shoe racks can also be kept
 aisa karne se yah ganda bhi kam hoga or footware kharaab hone se bache rahenge
 - Always keep in mind the changes in the weather like, it is necessary to protect the shoe rack from the humidity of winter and rainy season
 - kai footware aise hote hai jinkistemaal ham bahut kam karte hanto unhen shu rack main rakhane kii bajaay dibbe main pack karke alag rakh den

 Let me tell you that in this phase, voting was to be held in 52 seats in 11 districts of Purvanchal, but after the death of Samajwadi Party candidate Chandrashekhar Kashyap from Alapur seat in Ambedkar Nagar district, the election was postponed here
 ab is seat par 9 march ko voting hogi or sapa ne yahaan se ab kashyap kii patni sangeeta ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 This phase is being seen as a litmus test for the SP and Congress alliances, as these two parties won almost 80 per cent of these in the 2012 assembly elections

 On this, the Aam Aadmi Party has said that the big question now stands on democracy, is it that the people of Delhi have chosen the Lieutenant Governor or Kejriwal?

 The road will continue from Parliament to Parliament
 Jangparti made it clear that there is a Supreme Court for settlement of disputes in the center-state jurisdiction and we will go in that

 In some international markets, the next crop has started coming

 'dal traders argue that in many cities of the country, the stock of tur dal is not as much as it should have reached
 iskaa nateeja ye hua he ki retail keemton ab bhi bad rahi hai
 However, during the festive season, the demand for arhar dal generally decreases and this time also the pulse traders argue that when the demand decreases, the prices will also be lower
 daal vyapaaree anand garg kehete hai, 'diwaali ke sizan main retailor daal peeche kar duusare saamaan jaise dry-fruits or duusare gift items kii bikri zyaada karata he
 In festivals people buy less pulses, when people buy less pulses, their demand will also decrease and prices will also come down gradually
 yani arhar daal kii keemten saamaanya hone ke liye aapako diwali khatm hone kaa intazaar karnaa padegaa
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley claimed on Tuesday, 'the pulse of some rabi crops has started coming
 kuch antarrashtriya bazaar main bhi agali fasal aani shuru hui he
 
 
 In almost all the states, prices have started to moderate in the last 5-7 days

 haryana main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or congress ke bich 24 aktubar ko jahaan kaante kii takkar dekhne ko mili, vahiin ek shaks saaf taur par vijeta banakar ubhara
 He is - Dushyant Chautala
 haalanki mahaj 10 maheene pehle gathit unki jananaayak janata party (jejepi) ne vidhansabha kii 90 main se keval 10 siten jeetin, par yah aankada unhen kingmekar kii gaddi par baitaane ke liye kaaphi tha
 In this episode, 31-year-old Dushyant Chautala not only seized the opportunity to rule Haryana on his own from the hands of BJP and Congress, but has also given a new unexpected turn to the political developments of the state
 paanch maheene pehle bhaajapa ne rajya kii sabhi 10 loksabhaa siten jiti thim
 This had led to speculation that the party would eventually raise the figure of its 47 seats won in the 2014 assembly elections to a higher level
 congress or kshetreey taqatvar party bhartiya rashtriya lok dal (ieneldi) donon andruni kalah or baghawat se taar-taar the or ve apane gharelu maidaanon ko hi bachaae rakhane kii jaddojahad main lage the
 The JJP, on the other hand, was seen as a youth party led by a young leader who was fighting the stalwarts of Haryana politics
 vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ne kai mithkon ko tod diya or desh bhar main vipakshi takaton main nai jaan foonkane kii ummiden jagaa deen
 As evident from the last few elections — Delhi, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh — the charisma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the tremendous electoral machinery of BJP President Amit Shah cannot always ensure bjp's victory
 2014 or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main sara desh modi lahar main bah gaya thisake ulat rajya ke chunaavon main matadaata vijetaon ko chunane se pehle rajya sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj, unhen chunauti dene vaale dalon ke vaadon or mukaable main utari partiyon ke netritv kaa cheharaa dekhakar faisla karte hai
 Modi and Shah have gone beyond caste equations to a large extent in weaving the Jitau electoral alliance, as they did in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, but Haryana's mandate proves that caste still holds importance
 rajnatik paryvekshakon ke mutabik, haryana ke jaaton ke bich pasra asantosh dushyant chautaala ke ubhaar kaa sabab bana or isi ke chalate congress bhi ladaai main dam-kham ke saath vaapasi kar saki, jisaki aguai purv mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda kar rahe the
 With the intention of ending the Jats dominance in Haryana politics, Modi made Manohar Lal Khattar the chief minister in 2014, who is an outsider and Punjabi Khatri and his father came from West Pakistan
 is tarah modi ne jaaton ke ek bade hisse kii naaraazgi mol le lee thi
 The Jats also stood with Modi this time, but he was not in a mood to forgive Khattar
 vishleshkon ke mutabik, is samudaay ko laga ki khatter sarkaar kii nitiyon ne unke liye saarvajanik kshetra ke sansthaanon main naukariyon ke daravaaje band kar die hai or sarkari naukariyon main aarakshan ke liye kiye gaye unke andolan se sakchati or manamaane dhang se nipta gaya
 Recently the Jats held protests for more than two months and demanded compensation for their lands acquired by the National Highways Authority of India
 magar rajya sarkaar se unhen koi raahat nahin mili
 In the 2014 assembly elections, about 19 percent of the Jats voted for the BJP
 centre for da study of develping societies (siesds) kaa ek vishleshan bataata he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ke haq main jaaton kaa samarthan chalaang lagaakar kareeb 50 fisadi par pahunch gaya
 But Khattar failed to retain that support in this election
 bhaajapa ke ek andruni sutara kehete hai, ''khatter ne dakshata se prashasan chalaaya, ve (sarkari) bhartiyon or sarkari sevaaon kii delivery main paardarshita laae, magar ve jaaton ke gusse kaa andaaj lagane main naakaam rahe or use dur karne ke liye bhi unhone zyada kuch nahin kiya
 The same anger came in favor of Jat leaders Dushyant and Hooda
 apane mukhyamantri kaal ke shuruaati vakt main khatter ko kanoon or vyavastha banaae rakhane main naakaami kii dharna se jujhna padaa
 Law and order in front of Baba Rampal's violence in 2014, demonstrations by Jats demanding reservation in 2016, and riots after convicting Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in rape case in 2017 The challenge was presented
 khatter ke mantrimandal ke saathiyon ne unki 'anubhavheenata' or in ghatnaon se 'kharaab' dhang se nipatane kii khuleam aalochana kii
 But gradually he got both confidence and success
 unhen rajkaaj main paardarshita laane kaa shrey diya gaya, vah bhi us rajya main jahaan bhrashtachar saarvajanik jivan main aam dharra ban gaya tha
 While former state chief minister Om Prakash Chautala and his son Ajay — Dushyant's father — are serving jail sentences in a corruption case, the Enforcement Directorate has filed a charge sheet against Hooda
 chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan khatter ne matadaataaon ko bataaya ki sarkari tainatiyon or niyuktiyon main, or bhu-upyog badalane kii ijaajat dene main bhi, ve kis tarah paardarshita laae
 The BJP also made national security, removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and corruption-free governance in its election campaign
 magar zyaadaatar votaron ke liye asli chintaa aarthik mandi, kheti-kisaani ke sankat or pani, bijli tathaa swasthya sevaaon sareekhee buniyadi suvidhaon ko lekar thi
 Haryana, which accounts for almost half of India's automobile manufacturing, was experiencing a slump in the region
 rajya main 2015 or 2016 ke dauraan kisaanon kii aatmahatyaon main bhi 54 fisadi kii badhotaree dekhi gai—jo 162 se badhkar 250 par pahunch gai
 Hooda and his son Deepender neutralized the issue by supporting the Center on Article 370, even though they had to go against the party's stand for it
 congress ne sthaneey muddon par zyada jor diya
 Hooda kept reminding the Khattar government of the '154 promises' he had made but 'not fulfilled'
 bhaajapa na keval satta main lautne ke aatmavishvaas se labalab thi, balki usne 75 siton se zyada jeetne kaa lakshya tay kiya tha
 One reason for his confidence is that there was chaos in the opposition camps
 congress main sanghathan ke badlaav bahut deree se, chunaav ke mahaj ek maheene pehle kiye gaye, jisase party kii sambhaavnaaon ko dhakka laga
 Kumari Selja was replaced as President of the State Congress in place of Ashok Tanwar, while Tanwar's arch rival Hooda was put in charge of the party's election committee, which actually made him the chief ministerial candidate
 tanvar ne congress chhod di or jejepi ko apana samarthan de diya
 Dushyant had broken away from INLD to form JJP
 ajay or dushyant ne jejepi kii sthapana kii, to om prakaash chautaala ke ek anya bete abhaya ab ieneldi chalaa rahe hai, jise is chunaav main ek hi seat se santosh karnaa padaa he
 Congress insiders say that if the change in leadership had happened at least a year earlier, the party would have done even better
 nateezon se is theory ko bhi bal mila he ki sirf anbhavi or tape-tapaae netaa hi party main nai jaan foonkane kii patakatha likh sakate hai
 The whisper has started that former president Rahul Gandhi put his hand on the back of the young but incompetent leaders instead of the veteran leaders who had shown up
 rahul ke samarthak ise dushprachaar kahkar khaarij kar dete hai
 "rahul Gandhi made Kamal Nath and Ashok Gehlot the chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, not youngster Jyotiraditya Scindia or Sachin Pilot," says an aide of Rahul
 '' ve kehete hai, ''assam main jab hemanth biswa sarama ne baghawat kii, tab unhone tarun gogoi kaa saath diya
 It is not about the young or the veteran leader, the matter is who they think is the right person for leadership
 '' rahul or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko ab apane chayan ko lekar shaayad zyada ehtiyaat baratane kii jarurat he
 —with Uday Mahurkar uttar pradesh ke CM yogi adityanath kii police tamaam aalochanaon ke baavjood pradesh se badmaashon ke safaaye ke apane abhiyaan main juty hui he
 Now in Noida, adjoining Delhi, there is another encounter between the UP Police and the miscreants, in which two miscreants were injured and arrested by the police
 police ne bataaya ki donon badmaashon ke paas se ek desi pistaul, ek desi katta or ek motorcycle baraamad hui he
 The injured miscreants have been admitted to the hospital
 police ne donon badmaashon kii pahchaan chini urf aaazaad or aas mohammad ke rup main kii he
 Investigation has revealed that Aas Mohammed has gone to jail in the past in a mob
 police ne bataaya ki mubir kii soochna ke aadhaar par enaibi chaowkee ke paas police nakaabandi kar checking kar rahi thi
 Then two suspects riding on a bike appeared
 police ne unhen rukne kaa ishaara kiya to ve bhaagane lage
 When the police chased them, the miscreants saw themselves surrounded and fired on the police party near d Park
 police ne bhi javaabi firing kii, jisamen donon badmaash goli lagane se ghayal ho gaye
 Police had earlier admitted both the miscreants to the local hospital in an injured condition
 lekin sthaneey aspataal ke doctor ne bataaya ki badmaash kepair main golilgi hui thi
 We have referred him to Delhi as we do not have complete treatment facilities for him
 uttar pradesh ke muradabad main ek food factory par mangalvaar ko chaape ke dauraanapashuon kii haddiyonka jakhira mila
 The raiding officials feared that they would be used to make the biscuits
 is aashay kii khabar angreji akhbaar hindustan times ne prakashit kii he
 The newspaper has written that sources in the Food Department have informed him that the factory will be using powdered or other form of animal bones to make the biscuits tastier and crisper
 yah maamla tab saamne aayaa he jab centre sarkaar ne food sefti or standard act main badlaav ke liye task force banane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Significantly, the mps raised the issue of adulteration in Parliament in full force earlier this month
 muradabad ke food security or drug administration officer umesh pratap ne factory kaa license radd kar diya he
 Located in Katghar, Moradabad, the factory is located at a distance of 300 km from Lucknow, the capital of UP
 chif food security officer wike rathi ne kaha, 'factory ke utpaadon ke sample liye gaye hai
 These contain portions of rusk and biscuit preparation products
 or in sabhi chizon ko pareekshan ke liye bheja gaya he
 Pratap said that large quantity of animal bones in the factory is a violation of food security provisions
 unhone kaha ki jaanch main milawat or swasthya ke liye hanikaarak tatwon kii pushti hone par factory maalik ko jail or paanch lakh rupee kii sajaa ho sakati he
 The factory, named after Aroma Foods, is owned by Azim Iqbal, who owns two units of a biscuit factory in Moradabad
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki factory ke bheetar itani badi maatra main pashuon kii haddiyon ke bhandaaran ke sawaal par azim ikbaal santoshjanak jawaab de paane main naakaam rahe
 Experts say that adulteration of animal bones in food products is very harmful for health
 isse infections or kai bimaariyaan ho sakati he

 The reason for this love story going viral is that the girlfriend is a former sex worker and the lover is a handicapped beggar
 bangladesh ke photographer akaash ne apane fasebuk pej par 14 may ko ek tasviir ke saath is khaas lav story ko bayaan kiya he
 According to this post, Bangladesh sex worker Razia Begum falls in love with beggar Abbas Mia
 in donon kii pehali mulaakaat kaa lamhaa bhi kisi filmi kahani se kam nahin he
 One day it was raining heavily, Razia was standing under the tree
 kisi vajah se razia us vakt ro rahi thi, tabhi uski najar wheelchair par baithe ek bhikhaari par padi
 The beggar came close and gave 50 taka (bangladeshi currency) in Razia's hands
 razia ke dimag main us vakt aayaa ki mere jivan main ye pehla insaan he jisane bina meraa istemaal kiye mujhe paise die hai
 At this point, Razia began to consider that beggar as the best man in the world
 is mulaakaat ke baad donon alag ho gaye
 Razia sought beggar Abbas for several days
 lekin vah use nahin mila
 Several months later, Razia finds Abbas sitting under a tree again
 donon ne aapas main baatcheet kii to pataa chalaa ki apahiz hone ke chalate uski patni use chhodkar chali gai thi
 Both of them extended their hands towards each other and then agreed to be together
 kuch hi dinon baad donon ne shaadi kar lee
 Akash, quoting Razia, wrote in her post that, she no longer considered herself capable of loving anyone, but wants to carry the wheelchair of beggar Abbas till death
 ab donon kii shaadi ke chaar saal ho gaye hai
 The comments razia ne bataaya ki shaadi ke samay abbaas ne vaada kiya tha ki vah use kabhi rone nahin degaa, jise vah aaj bhi nibhaa rahaa he
 Many times, there is nothing to eat in the house, yet both of them are fulfilling their happy lives
 razia ne bataaya ki use yaad nahin he ki uske maa-pita koun hai
 At what age did she become a sex worker
 vah kaaphi samay se is dhandhe se nikalnaa chaahati thi, lekin beti ke paalan-poshan ke chalate aisa nahin kar paa rahi thi
 However, he never told his daughter that he was a sex worker
 jivan main abbaas ke aane ke baad sabakuch saamaanya ho gaya he
 The whole family lives happily
 ek din kaaphi barish ho rahi thi, razia ped ke neeche khadi thi
 For some reason, Razia was crying at that time, when she saw a beggar sitting in a wheelchair
 bhikhaari najadik aayaa or razia ke haathon main 50 taka (bangladeshi mudra) de diya
 At that time it came to Razia's mind that this is the first person in my life who has given me money without using me
 isi baat par razia us bhikhaari ko duniya kaa sabase acha insaan samajhane lagi
 The two separated after this meeting
 razia ne bhikhaari abbaas ko kai dinon tak dhundha
 But he did not get it
 kai maheenon baad razia ko abbaas ek ped ke neeche phir baitha mila
 When both of them had a conversation, it was found that his wife had left him due to being bedridden
 donon ne ek-duusare kii taraf haath badhaayaa or phir ek saath rahane ko taiyaar ho gaye
 a few days later both of them got married
 razia ke hawaale se akaash ne apane post main likhaa he ki, vah khud ko ab kisi se pyaar karne karne ke kaabil nahin samajhati thi, lekin marate dam tak bhikhaari abbaas kaa wheelchair aage badhanaa chaahati he
 Now both of them have been married for four years
 tippaniyan Razia said that at the time of marriage, Abbas promised that he would never let her cry, which he is still performing today
 kai baar ghar main khaane ko kuch bhi nahin hota he, phir bhi donon jaise taise pet bharkar raji-khushi jivan bitaa rahe hai
 Razia reveals that she does not remember who her parents are
 vah kis umr main sex varkar bani
 She wanted to get out of this business for a long time, but could not do so due to the upbringing of her daughter
 haalanki usne apni beti ko kabhi bhi nahin bataaya ki vah sex varkar hai
 Everything has become normal after Abbas' arrival in life
 puraa parivaar khushi ke saath rahete hai

 ) Two days after the country's 70th Independence Day, Bihar BJP took out the tricolor in Patna on Wednesday
 bihar vidhansabha ke saamne sthit shahid smarak ke paas se bijepi ne is yatra kii shuruyaat kii, jo patna ke kargil chowk par jaakar khatm hui
 Hundreds of BJP workers took part in the Tiranga Yatra
 haathon mentirangaa liye bijepi kaaryakartaaise yatra ke dauraan kaaphi utsahit dikhe
 The surrounding area became buzzing with the slogans of 'vande Mataram' and 'bharat Mata Ki Jai'
 bijepi ke tirangaa yatra ko dekhne sadak ke donon ore logon kii bheed bhi umad padi
 Apart from Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, BJP state president Mangal Pandey, several mlas were also present in the bjp's Tiranga Yatra
 'aatankwaad se mukaable ke liye yatra'yatra main aage-aage do pahiyaa vaahan par haath main tirangaa liye bijepi kaaryakarta or uske peeche ek trek par savaar bijepi ke variya netaa
 Even in the scorching sun, the enthusiasm of BJP workers was at its peak
 is maukey par kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki desh main shanti ke liye or antakawaad se datakar muqabla karne ke liye bijepi ne tirangaa yatra nikaali he
 The tricolor trip has nothing to do with politics, he said, that the work that could not be done in the country in 70 years, the BJP wants to do it in its five-year term
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki tirangaa yatra nikaalane kaa makasad raajnneeti karnaa nahin, balki desh main aman or shanti kaa paigaam dena he
 The Union Minister said that the BJP does not look at the Tricolor Yatra through the prism of politics
 dusron ko isamen raajnneeti najar aati ho to hamen kuch nahin kahana
 'congress should respond' Ravishankar Prasad strongly condemned Congress leader Salman Khurshid's statement on the issue of Bluechistan and said that Congress should respond on this issue
 unhone kaha ki piem modi ne pakistan ko maanviya adhikaar ke ulanghan ke aadhaar par gheraa he
 But Congress is talking about this issue in three-four voices
 jab bhartiya janata party ne 18 agast ko chandrashekhar kii niyukti rajasthan ke sanghathan mantri ke rup main kii thi, to yah baat agle varsh disambar main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye uski ranneeti ke bare main bahut kuch kah rahi thi
 Since taking office, he has been touring and holding meetings across the state, often in the presence of BJP state president Ashok Parnami, to take feedback on how to improve the party's prospects in elections next year
 Is something necessary to be done? aath varsh se party bina kisi sanghathan mantri ke chal rahi thi, jabaki is pad ko party or sangh ke bich ek mahatvapurn kadi ke rup main mana jaataa he
 The Sangh nominates people from its cadre for the post, as in the past, the people nominated thus far have often suffered a confrontation with Vasundhara Raje, the party's undisputed leader in the state
 yah tathy ki chandrashekhar ne yahi pad varanasi main tab sambhala tha, jab pradhan mantri narendra modi ne 2014 main vahaan se sansadeey chunaav ladaa tha, unhen yahaan bheje jane kaa mahatv jataata he
 On 29 August, Modi visited Udaipur — one of his few trips to Rajasthan
 uske baad unhone gajendra singh shekhavat ko, jo jodhpur se saansad hai, krishi rajya mantri ke rup main shaamil kiya
 He also promoted Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore as Minister of State with independent charge for sports
 pherbadal main rajya ke anya teen mantriyon si
 R
 choudhary, pi
 P
 choudhary or arjuna meghavaal ko bhi achche vibhaag mili
 As if this was not enough, Modi also appointed two bureaucrats from Rajasthan - outgoing Union Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi as Comptroller and Auditor General and already retired Sunil Arora as Election Commissioner of India
 yah sari baaten sanket detii hai ki bhaajapa-sangh rajasthan ko phir jeetne ke liye har sambhav prayaas karenge
 Considering that the equation between Raje, Modi and Shah was not amicable at all till last year, but now it is all history
 shah ne, jo har varg ke kaaryakartaaon se, sabhi vidhayakon, mantriyon or pramukh vyaktiyon se mili, unhen sarkaar par dosha daalane yaa uski khaamiyon ko ujagar karne kaa mauka dene se inkaar kar diya, or us har vyakti ko jhidak diya, jisane sarkaar kii kshamta par kataaksh karne kii koshish kii
 Shah told them what they had done and what should be done to strengthen the organization
 janvari 2016 kii apni yatra ke vipareet, jab vah mantriyon se nijee taur par bhi mili the, is baar unhone raaje ko har feedback baithak main shaamil banaae rakhaa
 In the end, he praised Raje and said that unlike the Congress, as long as Vasundhara is there, there is no leadership issue in the state
 raaje ne unki yatra ke bare main india today se kaha ki ''unhone party ko phir se jeevant bana diya; ham apane kaaryakramon main aadha rasta chal chuke hai lekin unhone party ko urjavan bana diya, taaki hamaari gati tej ho sake
 After his departure, Vasundhara sent the party's Rajasthan Pradesh BJP president Ashok Parnami and the union worker V
 sent to the state as state in-charge
 satish ke saath baithak kii
 As a result, Parnami has started a comprehensive tour of the state and is organizing meetings at the ground level
 ve kehete hai, ''shah kii yatra ne hamen chunavi rang main laa diya he
 "why is Rajasthan important for BJP?" Rajasthan gave the BJP 163 out of 200 seats in the assembly, and a full 25 seats in the parliamentary elections
 lekin rajasthan ne pichley chaar chunaavon main sattashinon ko satta se baahar kiya he
 The BJP won Rajasthan in 1990 and 1993
 lekin iske liye shah ke sanghathanaatmak kaushal or raaje ke shashan ke saath kendra main modi ko ek or mauka dene ke prati matadaataaon ke aagrah kii aavashyaktaa he
 This is the reason Raje has maintained cordial relations with the RSS and the party
 bhaajapa ko ummid he ki raaje-shah kaa gathjod vah kar saktaa he, jo party ne gujarat main, chhattisgarh main or madhyapradesh main jeet kii hetric bana kar kiya he, vishesh taur par isliye ki rajya main congress ke chehre, sachin payalat, jo pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh hai, ko pratidwandviyon ashok gahalot or seepi joshi se bahut pratirodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 This is the reason that the party can move towards holding elections in these states along with the parliamentary elections, so that the votes received for the respective chief ministers can be linked to the votes cast in the name of Modi
 garmi kaa mausam aate hi log thandi vaadiyon kii taraf rukh karne lagate hai, is mausam main pahari ilaakon kii raunak kaaphi bad jaati he
