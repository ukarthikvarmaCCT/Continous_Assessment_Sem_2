 Is the Congress engaged in hijacking the bjp's agenda through soft Hindutva before the Lok Sabha elections? This question is arising because the one month old Kamal Nath government has taken many decisions related to cow, temple Kumbh and gaushalas on which BJP has been contesting and winning many elections till now
 is par jahaan bijepi ne ise mahaj chunavi stant qaraar diya he, vahiin congress ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki gaay, gaushala or mandiron par sirf bijepi kaa patent nahin he

 iske saath hi unhone bijepi ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki gaay, gaushala or mandiron par sirf bijepi kaa patent nahin he

 4
 sabase taaja faisla he santon or pujaariyon ke maandey main teen guna badhotaree kiye jane kaa
 According to the latest decision, the temples which do not have any land come under the government
 unke pujaariyon ko 1000 rupye kii jagah ab 3000 rupee kaa maandey milegaa
 Similarly, the honorarium of temple priests with land up to 5 acres has been increased from Rs

 520 to Rs
 1560 per month
 mana ja rahaa he ki isse madhyapradesh ke kareeb 35000 pujaariyon ko phayda milegaa

Like Bharatiya Janata Party leader LK Advani, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav also asked party workers to be ready for elections, predicting the Lok Sabha's upcoming elections to be held this year

 sabhi kaaryakarta or padaadhikari apni-apni jimmedaariyon ko nibhaae or sanghathan ko booth str par majboot karne par khaas jor den
 In the meeting, the SP workers also decided to organize a program for the promotion of various achievements of the government on 23 April

 sena pramukh ne kathith rup se raashtrapati se anurodh kiya ki vah pradhanmantri ko apana bayaan waapas lene ke liye kahen jo unhone samachar patr ko diya tha
 It is notable that in an interview to a Chinese newspaper, Prime Minister Gilani recently accused Kayani and Lt Gen Shuja Pasha, the head of the country's intelligence agency inter-services Intelligence (ISI), for violating the law
 gilaani ne kaha ki america ko bheje gaye 'gopneey sandesh' maamle kii jaanch kar rahe sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh kayaani or pasha ne sarkaar kii manjuuri ke bagaiyr apana paksh rakhaa

 unhen bhagat singh aaj bhi yaad hai or ve lahore jaise shaharon se bhagat singh ke rishte ko jinda rakhane ke liye aaj bhi jaddojahad kar rahe hai
 Pakistan's Left Wing Party and Awami Workers Party are running a campaign in Lahore these days, under which there is a demand to change the name of Fawara Chowk to Bhagat Singh Chowk
 favaara chowk vahi jagah he jahaan bhagat singh, sukhdev or raajaguru ko faansee di gai thi
 Then this place used to be inside Lahore District Jail
 lahore jail bhi ab camp jail ho chukaa he or faansee vaali jagah ek trephic iland ban gaya he
 Significantly, Bhagat Singh spent his college days in Lahore, while his village is a few hours away from Lahore
 ban gaya tha prastaav, mil gai thi manjuuri lekin
 
 
 On the demand of the left party, last year, the Lahore City Government formed the Dilaksha Lahore Committee, which was to prepare a proposal for naming the places associated with them in the name of Lahore-based personalities
 tab samiti ne favaara chowk ko bhagat singh kaa naam dene kaa suzav diya or lahore city gavarment ne isaki manjuuri bhi de di, lekin kattarpathiyon ko yah prastaav raas nahin aayaa
 He also went to court proposing the issue raising the name of Islam in the Islamic country, but the Awami Workers' Party and Lahore-based human rights activists continued their fight

 On March 23 this year, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged, party leaders Farooq Tariq, women activist Saeeda Deep and some people took pictures of Bhagat Singh to pay homage to the martyrs of Fawara Chowk, but workers of Hafiz Saeed's Jamaat-ud Dawa Started opposing it

 When the bakery owner Chaudhary Akram came to know about the program, he added 25 kg to the cake in support of the program

 On September 27, more than 200 people arrived at Fawara Chowk to support the campaign and this time Jamaat-ud Dawa's supporters were missing

 bijepi netaa vijendra gupta ne kaha kii vidhansabha kaa yah satr raajnneetik badale kii bhaavana se bulaayaa gaya he
 There is no special work to be done in this session
 gupta ne kaha ki is vakt dilli main jabardast thand pad rahi he, lekin dilli sarkaar monsoon satr kaa aayojan kar rahi he
 This government is also ignoring the constitutional traditions

 ) After the defeat of UP, Congress leaders have now started talking to Rahul Gandhi bluntly
 netao kii tamaam shikayaton ke baad ab rahul gandhi apni ranneeti main badlaav karne ja rahe hai
 a senior Congress leader who met Rahul on condition of anonymity told Aaj Tak, 'chanting the garland of Modi opposition, the Congress made Modi the Chief Minister from the Prime Minister and since 2014 Rahul Gandhi in chanting the garland of Modi protest and By accelerating Modi's stature has increased so much that he is winning election after election

 "according to sources, after the defeat in UP, a senior leader of the state Congress told Rahul bluntly," the Antony Committee had said in the review report of the reasons for the 2014 defeat, that the anti-hindu image and Muslim appeasement should take on the party Drowned
 ab party ko bahusnkhyakon kii raajnneeti kerani chahie, lekin na party kaa alaakaman is par gambhir he or na hi nichle str par sanghathan is par dhyaan de rahaa he
 Conversely, in order to garner Muslim votes, alliances are made in UP, this makes Rahul's visit to temples a mere formality, and does not affect him
 'ye wo bayaan hai, jo hawa main tairaa karte the, lekin ab halaat itane bighad gaye hai ki, congress netaa khulkar rahul gandhi se ye baaten bolne lage hai
 If sources are to be believed, now Rahul is also thinking seriously about this

 Suppose three changes in Rahul's strategy, Rahul is now going to make three big changes in his strategy, which he has already discussed in front of Congress mps

 'adwani kii rathyatra' or akhilesh yadav kii 'cycle yatra' jahaan behad asardaar maani jaati hai, vahiin babulal marandi iske apwaad rahe hai
 Serahul Gandhi is continuously active after Rahul Gandhi's return from the footsteps
 pehle unhone ramlila maidan or phir sansad main kisaanon kaa mudda uthaaya - or ab use aage badhaate hue padayatra karne ja rahe hai
 The BJP says that Rahul's footsteps may not benefit the farmers - it can definitely be beneficial for the Congress and his health
 rahul gandhi kii prastaavit padayatra maharashtra ke vidarbha se shuru hogi
 Then it will reach other parts of the country via Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan
 padayatra ke dauraan rahul rojaanaa 15 se 18 kilometre kaa safar tay karenge
 Earlier, he traveled 11 km from Gaurikund in Lyncholi in Uttarakhand - which took him five hours to complete
 bhale hi yeraajnneetik anushtanka hissaa rahaa ho, lekin reharsal ke liye bhi acha rahaa
 Naidu's Reeti Poru Bata, TDP leader N
 Chandrababu Naidu undertook a two-thousand-kilometer march in October 2012, raising problems for Andhra Pradesh farmers
 naidu vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa the jab unhone `rity poru bata` (yani padayatra) shuru kii
 He became the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh by winning the last assembly elections
 akhilesh kii cycle yatrabaat tab kii he jab uttar pradesh main mayawati kii sarkaar thi
 After receiving a green signal from Mulayam Singh, Akhilesh rode a bicycle and set out on a journey
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan akhilesh ne kareeb saadhe nau hajaar kilometre kii yatra kii - jisamen cycle kii sawari bhi shaamil rahi
 The 2012 election results showed how big a role the bicycle played in securing power
 maa, maati maanush yatrapashchim bengal main mamata banerjee ke satta main pahunchane kii kai vajahen ho sakati hai - lekin unki padayatra kaa bhi kaaphi ahm role rahaa
 Mamta's padyatra may not have been long but it had the biggest impact in Jadavpur, which was considered to be the impregnable fort of the then Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee
 rajasekhar reddy kii yatraye wo daur tha jab hyderabad cybrabad ke naam se janaa jane laga tha
 Chandrababu Naidu was then the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh - and he was everywhere
 tabhi congress netaa wies rajasekhar reddy ne andhra pradesh main lambii padayatra kii
 Reddy went to the village and explained his point to the people
 wo logon se jude or jab chunaav hue to unki satta main vaapasi hui
 Not only this, the Congress got a tremendous advantage in the Lok Sabha elections a few days later
 adwani kii rathyatracendre tak bijepi ke satta ke safar main adwani kii rathyatra mile kaa pathar sabit hui
 In 1990, Lal Krishna Advani set out on a journey from Somnath to Ayodhya in Gujarat, but his chariot was stopped in Bihar
 adwani kaa rath ayodhya to nahin pahunch paaya lekin uske baad bijepi ko dilli kii kursi tak jarur pahunchaa diya
 Traveling to understand the country Chandrashekhar was sure to be in the news due to his talk and opposition to Indira Gandhi - but people were able to feel directly connected and close to him during the padyatra
 1983 main jab chandrashekhar ne padayatra shuru kii to yuva turk ke taur par unhen pahchaan mil chuki thi
 Chandrasekhar's visit was to understand the country and the countrymen - though he got the result after seven years when he became the Prime Minister with the support of the Congress
 abhinayta se netaa kaa safar1982 main andhra pradesh main anti ramarao kii chaitanya rathyatra bhi unke liye satta kii seedhi bani
 In nine months, Rama Rao made four rounds of the state and traveled about 40 thousand kilometers
 yatra puri hone se pehle wo ghar nahin laute or apane do beton kii shaadi main bhi shaamil nahin ho paae
 Exceptions are Marandi: Babu Lal Marandi, who was the first Chief Minister of Jharkhand, can be considered an exception in this case
 bijepi chhodane or uske baad apni party jharkhand vikaas morcha (prajatantric) banane ke baad se hi marandi lagaataar rajya kaa daura kar rahe hai
 Party workers say that Marandi never spent two nights under one roof during the yatra
 aisa ek baar tabhi hua jab unke bete kii naksal hamale main hui maut ke baad ghar lautnaa padaa tha
 In 2014, Marandi's party got only two seats in the Modi wave
 siyaasi yatraaon se mili kamyaabi kii list main marandi kaa naam darj nahin ho paaya
 Probably because they could not convince people how different they are from BJP
 varanaa zyaadaatar netaaon ko aisi yatraaon ne kamyaabi dilaai he
 This is probably because the leader connects directly to his voter
 dilli main arvind kejariwal kaa dely doylaag bhi aisa hi experiment rahaa

 Donald Trump, the next president of America, had said during the election campaign that Apple would be asked to make its products in the US
 ab trump ne yah saaf kar diya he ki america companiyaan agar duusare deshon main plants laga kar products ko america main bechengi to unhen 35 fisadi se zyada tex dene honge
 Trump has simultaneously tweeted several tweets in which he has spoken harshly about such companies
 itnaa to saaf he ki isse america companiyon khaskar technology jagat par iskaa khaasaa asar padegaa or jaahir he isse mek in india par bhi asar padega
 Because many American tech companies are ready to set up their factories in India under Make in India, and many companies are also eyeing the Indian market
 piem modi kii mek in india main die jane vaale sahuliyaton kiwajah se kai america bharatmen apni factriyaan kholani kii taiyaari main thim
 But now with this mood of the trump, it is possible that she will put it in the freezer
 haalanki donald trump ne apane twit main yah bhi kaha he ki bijness ke liye tex or regaullation ko kam kiye jaaenge, lekin yah waisi companiyon ke li lagu nahin hoga jo america ko chhodkar duusare deshon main factriyaan bana rahi hai or phir apane products waapas america main bech rahi hai

 For every girl, 'marriage' is one of the most important moments of her life
 is maukey par vah sab kuch parfect karne kii puri koshish karti he, chaahe wo shaadi kii taiyaariyaan ho yaa phir khud ko tip-top rakhane kii baat ho
 If you want to wear a designer dress of your choice with a beautiful appearance on your wedding, then you have to keep yourself slim and fit and also have to leave some things
 aise main kisi bhi dulhan ko shaadi se pehle ke apane diet chart main in foods ko shaamil nahin karnaa chahie
 
 
 1
 artificial sweetnersah ham ye nahin kahenge ki brid ko chocolate hameshaa ke liye chhod deni chahie, lekin apni shaadi se kuch samay pehle tak unhen artificial sweetners se duuri bana leni chahie
 It is not easy to digest and it causes bloating in the body
 isliye shaadi par agar motaa nahin dikhnaa he, to artificial sweetners se kuch dinon ke liye duuri bana len
 2
 soda and carbonated drinkah mummy hameshaa se apane bacchon ko cold drink or soda jaisi chizon ko na pine kii salaah detii ain hai, lekin akasar ham mummy kii in baton ko andekha kar dete hai
 If you want to look different on your marriage, then definitely take this advice from Mummy
 shaadi se pehle apni maa kii is baat ko gambhirtha se len, kyonki sode se aapke chamakate hue daanton par nishaan banane kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 3
 sharaabah bear se na sirf aapaki baili (pet kii charbi) badhati he, balki kisi bhi prakaar ke alcohol ke seven se aapke chehre par phuulaapan nazar aane lagata he
 So save cocktail parties for your wedding and keep yourself absolutely perfect in this important moment of your life
 4
 Cheeses: You can eat pizza before marriage, but it should not be eaten at this time
 isse aapkaa vazan bad saktaa he
 5
 dairy products dairy products hamaare food chart kaa ahm hissaa hai, lekin shaadi kii date se pehle inhen apane diet chart se baahar rakhen, kyonki inase aapako cramps aa sakate hai or saath hi ye badahazmi bhi kar sakate hai
 However, yogurt in dairy products can prove to be beneficial for you as it improves the skin and is also good for the stomach
 6
 New food: You should definitely taste the new things of food, but if you have only a short time for your marriage, do not do these experiments
 in nai chizon se aapako allergy bhi ho sakati he or agar shaadi ke vakt aisa hua to mechap bhi aapke liye kuch nahin kar paaegaa

 During this time, he also tightened up on the old governments of the Congress and compared it to the development work of his government
 piem modi ne yahaan congress kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki pehle dol or deal vaali sarkaar thi
 PM Modi while explaining his statement also mentioned the plans of the Congress government
 piem modi ne kaha ki jo pehle satta main the, wo chaahate the ki garib garib hi rahe
 He said, 'the best example of this is farmer debt waiver
 kisi bhi visheshgy ne kabhi ye nahin kaha ki karjamaafee se kisaanon kii samasya kaa hal ho jayega

 We started the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, which is for the welfare of farmers
 yani no dol, no deal
 PM Modi said that through this scheme, our government has decided to give 6000 thousand rupees to 12 thousand crore farmers and for this, our government has launched this scheme in 24 days after working 24 hours
 apni sarkaar kii speed kaa bakhaan karte hue piem modi ne congress kii bhi aalochana kii
 He said, 'in the first government, time used to give the name of the scheme, that it should be run in the name of which family member
 'our 55 months and the 55 years of the others have given 2 contrasting approaches to governance
 They had a 'token approach', we have a 'total approach': pmindia has been battling poverty but they gave a token slogan - remove poverty
 How to achieve that was not specified: PM— PMO India (@pmoindia)march 2, 2019piem modi ne isse aage kaha ki piem kisaan sammaan nidhi yojana lambey samay tak kisaanon ko phayda pahunchane vaali yojana he

 Not tokens, Total Approach Apart from this, PM Modi also criticized the Congress government and said that earlier there was a practice of giving tokens, whereas we are working with Total Approaches
 piem ne kaha, 'congress sarkaar ne naaraa diya tha ki garibi hataao, lekin ye kaise hoga, wo nahin bataaya
 In the name of poverty alleviation, the Congress government gave a token of nationalization of banks
 lekin kisi garib ko bank ke daravaaje tak jane kaa intjaam nahin kiya

 In this affair, they spoil the taste of very serious subject many times
 aisa hi kuch film 'drishyam' ke bare main kah sakate hai
 Original 'drishyam' was made in Malayalam in 2013 and Mohanlal was its hero
 saadhe chaar karod ru
 The film of around 60 crores
 kii kamai kar gai thi jabaki camel hasan kii 'paapanaasham' (tamil) isi saal 3 july ko relies hui he or pasand kii gai he
 Hindi-based 'drishyam' is also a perfect copy
 lagbhag paune teen ghante kii film pehle hisse main bahut dhimi he or film kaa ant bhi kaaphi khinchaa hua lagata he
 Those who have seen the Malayalam version of it may not enjoy it in this version
 film dekhakar lagata he ki diarector ne apana kuch lagane kii jaraa-si bhi jehmat nahin uthaai he
 In the story how much Damajay is a cable operator in a town in Devganagova
 vah apni patni shriya saran or do betiyon ke saath masti se jivan ji rahe hai
 It happens that something happens to the inspector general of Goa, Tabu's son
 iske baad do pakshon ke bich jang shuru hoti he, ek jo apane bete ke bare main sachai jaananaa chahta he to doosraa apane parivaar ko bachaane ke liye kisi bhi had tak guzar jane ko taiyaar he
 Sometimes the story creates a thrill, but the director has fully implemented the Malayalam version
 malayalam film 2 ghante 44 minute kii thi to hindi 2 ghante 43 minute kii
 Now Bollywood remakes can give a sense of devotion
 unhen hindi audiyans ko dhyaan main rakhane kii jarurat thi
 The plot has been raised properly but the treatment has done a lot of junk
 dialog bahut hi thande hai or ditels kahin-kahin boring ho jate hai
 Ajay Devgan is seen losing his touch in the Star Appeal film
 vah kairactor main us tarah se utar nahin pate hai jaisi unase apeksha kii jaati he, shaayad kamjor diarection isaki vajah ho sakati he
 Throughout the film, he looks cut off
 mohanlal vaala conect unamem dur-dur tak nahin he
 The film is tabloid-chic
 ve film main aati hai to thodaa majaa aane lagata he
 He has shown a good fluctuation of emotions
 baaki sab saamaanya hai
 Since 2013, Ajay has not given any big hits other than 'singham Returns'
 aise main unhen ek hit kaa intjaar he
 The music of the film is given by Bharadwajne, and is of a very average type
 kamjor diarection ek or looj point he or editing doosraa
 It is a mid budget film
 is tarah ajay kii yah film box offis par koi bahut bada karishma karegi isaki ummid kam hi he
 By the way, Ajay too has accepted this
 mumbai ke maanghurd sthit mahila remand home se 22 kaidi bhaag gaye hai
 Most of these women were freed here during raids in connection with human trafficking
 govandi police ke mutabik, mahilaon ne apane bhaagane kii yojana pehle se hi bana lee thi or shaam chaar baje vah bakreed ke maukey par kam karmchaariyon kii maujuudagi kaa phayda uthaa kar ve bhaag gayi
 Police said the security personnel rang the alarm upon seeing them running away
 surakshakarmi 13 mahilaon ko bhaagane se roak paye lekin 22 pehle hi bhaag gai thim
 When the matter of going anywhere arises, the stomach starts gurgling

 Itching and stigma are two such classic compositions of nature that are difficult to erase
 mujhe khujali ghoomane kii lagi
 Such itching that was caused by selective bites in childhood, which was enjoyed while erasing
 kanjus aadmi ke saath sabase badi dikkat he ki use jindagi ke maje bhi lene hai or ek dhela bhi nahin kharch karnaa
 Two days factory leave and a comp off
 yani teen din main mujhe sab ghoomana tha lekin sharte lagu main ‘kam paise main’ kii chepi saaf dikh rahi thi
 Asked friends, if someone goes along, then everyone sets a packet for not getting leave
 ‘phir chalenge plan kar le’ tip baaten
 Huh ravivaar kii subah ghar se offis niklaa ki aaj kahin ghoomane jarur jaaoongaa
 Did not know where
 man main dar tha ki yaar kahaan jayega akelaa
 Google, friend and discus place in office, four places came to mind, Rishikesh, Amritsar, Manali or Shimla
 manali or shimla kaa naam aate hi khubasurat auraten chuda bichhiya pahane apane ‘unke’ saath safed barf pandas ke saath khelti or poj detii mujhe ankhon ke dayee taraf ‘badal luk’ main najar ain
 i sat down
 stats single or jagah honeymoon vaali
 i will not go here
 ek vajah ye bhi thi ki honeymoon vaali jagah he paise zyada kharch honge
 Time passed in the speed of reddening of the apple
 kuch dyside nahin ho paaya
 But i took the bag and left the factory
 uttar bharat kii taraf janaa ho to aapako moot durgandh se yukt kashmiri get bas adde kii taraf kooch karnaa hota he
 In the running Kashmiri Gate inquiry, i quickly dropped one of my inquiries on the counter, 'brother, where are the buses?' udhar se nashediyon ko jawaab die jane kii lay main aawaaj ai, ’pagal he kya, kahaan janaa he ye bataa’
 That night the process of getting hoppy was understood
 munh se nikal gaya manali
 Started saying yes go fast, the bus is leaving in 10 minutes
 he bhagwaan, plan cancil ho jaae, man koi thos vajah talashne laga
 Will you get a seat in front of Manali? Yes
 oh shit
 No No Window Side Seat
 haa wo bhi mil jaaegi
 o your acha thik he de do ek tikat
 How many 650 rupee
 Hi Amma, as soon as i heard the amount, i put the multiplication 2 formula and it turned out that my son was here when he got Rs 1300
 par kamabakht counter ke paas ek sundar ladki khadi thi to rupee waapas bhi nahin maange gaye
 As a result, holding the window seat next to the driver with the ticket, i covered the legs of the six-foot body in a bus to Delhi to Manali
 man kaa ek konaa ghabaraaya tha ki akelaa kahaan jayega
 You should not get bored anywhere
 paise bhi khub kharch honge
 Return tickets
 zyada se zyada tikat se 50 rupee kaatega
 Opened the Watts app to send an urgent message that a holiday cancell or a guest has come to the house
 par sab dhokhaa de gaye
 The Khatara government bus to Manali crossed the blue board of 'thank you for visiting Delhi'
 baraabar kii seat main sardi ke dar se sharaab kii chand bunde pi chuke sajjan baar-baar kandhe par sir giraakar mujhase maa kii mamata tip feel lete rahe
 On the way to the dhaba, they quickly stole the question, where are you going? ji manali
 With whom
 ji akele
 Bhavane offered and laughing in the same order said, 'why alone
 ’ yaar ek to vaise hi main khud daraa hua tha ki akele ja rahaa hum
 This one from above
 lekin andar kii baat baahar nahin aane di or ek dost kii baat vahaan muskaan or intervyuu vaale confidence ke saath gira di, ‘experience ke liye ja rahaa hum akelaa
 'the next question got along with saying great, be it from the media or acting field
 jawaab pate hi unke chehre par octopus paul baba jaise bhav dikhaai die
 From politics to the media, listening to the questions of ethics, there was a burst of curd in my mind
 sone kii nakal ne sawaalon kii bauchhaar kam kii
 Between the shaking of the bus, the neck kept on beating again and again, then got up
 vakt beetaa, neeli or kaali subah ke bich pahaad shuru ho gaye
 Looking at the clouds, it seemed as if someone had soaked the clouds in a bucket of indigo and hung them on a rope of a high roof
 badalon ke bich kataa sa chand usee rassi par tange mojey kii tarah muskura rahaa tha
 Hours passed and Kullu arrived
 bas driver kaanpati bas ko chhodkar mutane chalaa gaya
 Looking at the river flowing in Kullu from the window, it seemed as if a large monster pushed a beautiful river from a high mountain
 pattharon se bahati nadi ke takaraane par bachapan kii wo gullak yaad ai, jisamen kuch sikke daalate hi ham hilaakar dekhne lagate the ki gullak kitti bhari
 Without sounding "S xxrep 6 h " the driver climbed into the trembling bus
 najaaron ke bich main khachar khachar photu khenchataa rahaa
 Local people who have boarded the bus, understand that a new launda has arrived in the market
 ghoomte pahaado, peeche chhutate pedo ke bich achaanak ulti jaisaa kuch mahasoos hua
 Putting the hingoli in the bag on the tongue, started looking inside the bus
 peeche se teesri seat par chuda-sone kii chen pahane joda dikhaai diya
 Wife and husband were getting into each other
 kisi bhi single stats launde kii aatmahatya ke liye ye ek prerak kshan ho saktaa he
 But i had invested money on the ticket
 dopaher ek baje kareeb manali bas adda aa gaya
 Even before getting off the bus, the 'foreign spokesmen' of the hotels came and started showing the passengers the way to the hotel like Columbus
 log bhi swarg jate yuddhishthir kaa peechha kar rahe kute kii tarah unke peeche peeche ho liye
 Finally a spokesperson came to me and said, 'don't want a cheap hotel'
 ye sunate hi meraa sheesha dekhne kaa fouran man kara
 i often feel poor after sleeping
 par maine is positiwali liya or kaha- haa kitte kaa he
 It was raining lightly in Manali
 bas adde ke paas hi bane pravaktaa ke hotel pahunchakar jo cameraa dekha, man ke commers student ne hisaab lagaakar fouran bataaya, ’nikal le bete, 1500 se zyada kaa room hoga
 'I started looking at the room with a showy look, just like a show
 kamare ke rate poochne par pravaktaa ne pehle hajaar or sensex kii tarah dhadaam se girakar 500 rupee bol die
 My budget and intention was not even 500
 maine besharmi se kaha, ’meri shakl dekhakar lagata he 500 duungaa
 'so how many will you give, tell me? Brother, i do not have to stay in the hotel much, just walk
 akele hum bag rakhana he or raat ko sona he
 Just'
 thik he lao 350 rupee
 But upstairs room will have to be taken
 upar kaa cameraa malatab jahaan lakdi kii chat thi
 There was no other room
 lekin uski chuphi khubsuurati ye thi ki us kamare se vaadiyaan kahin zyada chumbakeey lagati thim
 As soon as we gave 350 rupees, a feeling arose in my mind that if Abe Vikas had spoken 200 rupees, then perhaps he would have been ready even then
 kara liya 150 kaa nuksaan
 Potty had not gone since morning
 aa bhi nahin rahi thi
 But it would be better to put it on, if it starts during walking, then i will turn cock in the way
 ‘shit’ seat par kuch vakt gujaarne ke baad pani ke liye jaise hi flush chalaaya
 It felt as if someone had fired a razor on Tasharif
 thanda pani itnaa ki fouran uth na gaya hota to vaaya tasharif se hote hue dimagi bukhaar chadh saktaa tha
 After this i considered it appropriate to refrain from bathing
 shart badalakar bina deree kiye main hotel se nikal liya
 When hungry, he entered a giant restaurant in front of him to eat
 hotel ke vishalyakaay or mahange hone kaa gyaan tab hua tab shahi paneer 180 rupee, daal 110, or ek roti shaayad 20-25 rupee kii ek likhaa dekha
 Suddenly hunger died
 meraa man snacks kii taraf bhaagane laga
 The mind, pocket and stomach deal was set at Rs 65
 jab paise bachate hai to pet bharne jaisi dakaar khud aa jaati he
 Nothing was known about Manali other than the names of some places
 maine kisi set dimag ke ghoomana shuru kiya
 It was raining lightly
 pahaado ko hotalon kii chhaton ke peeche khadey dekhte hue main chalata rahaa
 Going forward, he asked someone what is to be found on this road, so Hidimba Temple was heard in response
 mandir pahunchaa to jami barf kareeb se dekhne ko mili
 The temple used to cross the beautiful long park
 nae jode ke chipakkar chalane main achaanak sanskaar kii chunari jhalkane lagi thi
 The walls of the temple were covered with reindeer seals
 kute mandir ke chabutare par sansad kii peeche kii siton par baithe saansadon kii chup or sustaate se dikhe
 Afraid of going to the temple without taking a bath
 nai devi ji hai
 It will not be good to go like this
 par laga itti dur aakar na gaya to kahin kuch ulta shulta na ho jaae
 Between the believer and superstition, i stood like Toba Tek Singh and came inside the temple with an apology in mind
 mandir se neeche kii taraf ek raste par chalaa to thodi duuri par club house kaa board dikhaai padaa
 There were two benefits of walking
 ek teji se bhaagate rahane se sardi nahin lag rahi thi, doosraa har jagah auto ke paise bachaane kii khushi meri trip ko chumme jaisi khushi de rahi thi
 Sitting somewhere in between, silently looking at the sky, the inner silt was coming out on its own
 daftar kii kaanch kii deevaaron main popcorn kii tarah uchhalte rahane se bahut dur main khud ko sahi galat ke paar mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 The rain had intensified while going towards the club house
 club house pahunchaa to dekha ki dilli DL-5C tip numbers kii gaadiyaan lagi hai
 River rafting was not happening because of rain
 club ke andar snukers, billiards or ghost house main ‘oh yaa, oh yes’ sunakar mujhe khud ke desi hone par gumaan hua
 These people were doing the work that can be done in Delhi in these beautiful hills
 band diwaar ke andar 10 minute main meraa dam ghutane laga
 When it came out of the club house, the rain was strong and 65 rupees Tikki lying in the stomach had raised his hands
 bhukh lagane lagi
 Coming out of the clubhouse, the South India Dhaba Type gave some sound
 andar jaakar behad shant, pahari muskaan liye ishwar singh ji dikhaai die
 The owner of this hotel was CC Chef
 manu ko dayee taraf se dekhne ke dauraan kuch bhi 60 rupee se upar na dikhne par maine bade hausale ke saath manu ke bain taraf dekhnaa shuru kiya
 Sitting alone in the hotel, i spoke to Maggie and tea
 dhaba nadi ke thik kinare bana tha
 The river, mountains, wind and rain were all visible
 intjaar karte hue maine barish ko thodaa motaa or ujala mahasoos kiya
 Making Maggi in the kitchen, going to Ishwar Singh ji and asked, Uncle Kya Yeh Ice (I suspected that maybe i am feeling sleepy or getting sick
 ) ankal fouran bole, haa betaa ye barf gir rahi he
 Lord Kasam, suddenly felt as if four girls had proposed together
 khachar khachar photu khenchne ke baad main shant bhav se barf dekhtaa meri ankhon ke saamne ek sach baras rahaa tha
 Which had no purpose, deceit
 imotional logon ko jindagi main kam se kam ek baar girti barf jarur dekhni chahie
 The falling snow helps us create a new definition of sacrifice and gain
 barf ko hotel se nikalakar maine puraa bheegate hue mahasoos kiya
 People were staring at me
 main na jane kyon khush tha
 It was a time when i was not missing anyone
 khud ko gale lagane kaa man tha
 There was a feeling of laughing and crying by sitting on the knee and stretching out
 vajah bevajaah thi
 After getting wet, i started towards Mall Road
 barf tab bhi gir rahi thi
 Loving couples resort to umbrellas and umbrellas to avoid rain and snow
 lekin main bina sharaab pie nashe main ho chukaa tha
 On the road to Mall Road, i walked with great ease towards the 'amul Macho' ed, soaked with snow
 hansata rahaa
 Photu kept taking bhare pani par uchhalte hue chhapaakai karata rahaa
 Seeing me doing all this, a sister-in-law wore a sister-in-law and looked at me with reverence
 der raat hotel pahunchaa to saare kapade, juute bhig chuke the
 The room did not have heater facilities
 saare kapade utaare to sharir ko maine wibrasion mod main paaya
 To dry the shoes, remove the curtains of the room and penetrate them and hang the socks, shirts on the bulbs in the room and bathroom
 jhole se ek garm sadri nikaalkar razaai se pehle adaate hue maine apana brahmacharya banaae rakhana kaa dhong kiya
 While sleeping, i was afraid that if someone came in the night, do not take anything
 phone or purse maine takie ke andar chipa die
 One thought also came that if someone came and killed me, what would i do
 hanuman chalisa sach main dar dur karti he
 The next morning was Tuesday
 pahaado kaa ugta suraj or subah dekhne kaa man tha to main jaldi hi hotel ke kamare se nikal liya
 Afraid of mountains, snow and rain
 
 Seeing the hidden sun, the mind smiled deep inside
 rohtang bai paas band tha to main ek taxi main latakkar silog vaili pahunch liya
 The snow clad mountains were showing their green body somewhere
 kuch bade safed pahaado ke peeche kaaren jaise jaise bhaag rahi thim, pahaad vaise vaise hi ithlaate hue dur hue ja rahe the
 Seeing this grip of human and nature, there was a shuddering in the lower part of the knee
 gaadi se utarkar dur talak sirf ujle pahaad khud main akele akele magar ek duusare kaa haath thame khadey najar aae
 An abundant number of newly married couples were seen adorned on the icy mountain slurry
 sab bahut khush the
 They were killing each other by making ice balls
 tabhi mujhe ek pahaad ke lagbhag antim chor par ek viraan akelaa ped dikhaai diya
 i felt like going there
 upar kii taraf jate hue raste main kahin bhi achaanak se pair dhans jaataa tha
 The pleasure of getting a foot out of the snow is like jumping in the air
 upar pahunchate hue peeche chhutate pair ke nishaan dekhakar khushi ho rahi thi
 After about 20 minutes, i reached the top of the mountain, almost skipping several honeymoon couples
 vahaan se viraan khadaa ped kareeb 20 meter kii duuri par hoga
 Silently reaching the height of that snowy mountain, everything except the people was looking bright
 jami barf par filmi hero kii tarah kuch dil ke karibiyon ke naam likhe
 Wrote the names of many loving couples, writing down their names made me feel fulfilled
 suraj ek pahaad kii aad se duusare pahaad kii balakani par kud gaya
 Honeymoon couples held each other's hands and started coming up with the help of mules
 viraan ped ke paas khadey hokar poj dene lage
 Selfie is bringing people closer
 photu poj simate or ek jaise ho chale hai
 The couple started the tradition of getting on a honeymoon, hitting ice shells
 barf ke pahaad par main leta hua shunya ko soch rahaa tha or yakeenan khud ko gyani baba samaj rahaa tha
 Apart from the tenacity, yoga, peace, do not know what to do on that peak
 ab akele jane vaale logon ke liye mishaal paidaa karne kii khushrahmi liye maine jeb se angochhaa nikaala or barf bharkar hawa main oochaal diya
 Snowflakes kept falling on me in the air
 khud ke man or sharir par jami dhul utarati rahi
 Removed the camera lying in the pocket and started spending it
 honeymoon couples mere paagalpan ko dekhte hue selfi le rahe the
 Being a believer in love, i felt that these people had to be selfie free
 lihaaja ek honeymoon kapal se kaha, lie main aap logon kii tasviir le detaa hum
 From there immediately got the answer, 'so sweet of you, Aji, do not phone'
 donon poj dene lage or main khud kii pojishan change karte hue tasviren lene laga
 Bhabhi Ji put a deep red lipstick while holding the phone and asked the question, have you come alone or are the others down? Yes, i have come alone
 honeymoon kapal ne hont or ibro ke kone ek saath uthaakar kaha, ‘akele or wo bhi manali!’ man kiya ki bol duun, nahin to kya tumhaari tarah honeymoon tak kaa intjaar karun
 i have taken pictures, but remain decent
 ‘bahut sahi’ or chehre par mere liye sammaan laate hue bhabhi ji boleen, ‘lie ham bhi aapaki tasviren le lete hai
 'just then what i posed, Bhaiya regretted the idea of taking her photo
 phone, alavida or kuch ghante barf main bitaane ke baad main silong vaili se neeche laut padaa
 It was 3 o'clock on Tuesday and noon
 manali main ghoomane kii koi badi jagah bachi nahin thi
 The hotel did not feel like paying another day's rent
 buudhvaar kii chuttee baaki thi
 After reaching the bus station with a bag from the hotel, 3
 30 kii amritsar kii bas dikh gai
 The external beauty of the bus was blazing with mud
 manali main aane ke liye dhanyavad kaa haraa board kuch der main paar ho gaya
 My loneliness and old habits were dead, covered in snow
 main khud main puraa ho gaya tha
 We are never alone
 basharte hamaara man batooni, jeene kii khwahishon se bharaa or zindaa hona chahie
 i looked back and felt as if the snowy mountains gave me a wet kiss on my forehead
 chummi or akele manali main ghoomane ke baad mere muskuraate man se niklaa, shukriya manali
