 Whatever happened at Patna Airport on the occasion of Children's Day on 14 November, it was enough to show status in bjp's grandfather party
 shaam 3 baje patna airport par teen mantriyon ke swaagat main juty bheed ne airport kii dhajjiyaan uda di, bheed ranve tak ja pahunchi or mantriyon ko bheed se bachane ke liye bas main savaar hona padaa
 At the same time, Advanithanha was attending a children's program in Danapur, Patna, all alone
 patna ke danapur main shoshit samaaj ke bacchon ke bich baithe, adwani ke saath ek bhi bijepi netaa maujuud nahin tha
 Bihari Babu, who is considered to be his close and great supporter, also came to Advani, but it was only a formality
 kuch hi minuton main aupchaakita nibhaakar bihari babu kaarykram ke bich se nikal gaye
 Advani was once again very lonely in that program, but when he started speaking on stage, his pain came out
 udhar patna airport par lagbhag usee vakt bhagdad jaisi sthiti thi, jab nae navele mantriyon ke liye juty samarthakon kii bheed ne patna airport par suraksha kii dhajjiyaan uda deen
 It became clear that Advani did come to Patna, but there was no one to ask him from the BJP
 haalanki ek news angesi se baat karte hue adwani ne ye jarur kaha ki unhe piem nahin ban paane kaa koi malaal nahin he or desh is vakt bade badlaav se guzar rahaa he
 This Patna visit of Advani made one thing clear that this man who once decorated the BJP with his own hands, has become so lonely for which the party and leaders have no time
 is shuukravaar release hui he yashraj binar kii 'gunde', jisamen gundgardee karte nazar aaenge ranvir singh or arjuna kapur, or unke saath hai priyanka chopra, irfan khan or saurabh shukla
 
 
 The story of the film revolves around Vikram and Bala, ie Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor, who remain in Bangladesh after the 1971 hindustan-pakistan war, and are later forced to move back to Calcutta
 is
 
 
 halaat in donon ko gunda banane par majaboor kar dete hai, jiske baad inaki zindagi main aati hai nandita, yani priyanka chopra, jo ek cabre dancer hai or ye donon hi use dil de baithte hai
 
 
 'gunday' reminds me of '70s cinema, where there were' wall 'and' zanjeer ', or' friendly 'by Amitabh Bachchan and Shatrughan Sinha in the' 80s
 
 
 kuch aisi hi filmon ke tevar 'gunde' main aapako nazar aaenge
 
 
 The idea of heroism, which the '70s directors and actors created on the big screen, will be felt by the audience again
 
 
 phir chaahe vah film ke drishy hon, vikram or bala ke 'larger dain life' kairactor hon, yaa film kaa treetment
 
 
 There is no doubt that the pair of Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor will remind you of amitabh-shatrughan and amitabh-vinod Khanna sometime, but Ali Abbas Zafar missed something in the story, because from the very beginning one can understand what is going to happen
 is
 
 
 yani, aap pehle hi bhaanp jate hai ki aage kya hone vaala he
 
 
 On the other hand, the songs of the film are good and have become popular, but many places put a break on the speed of the film
 
 
 kisi bhi film main seens jaan daalane kaa kaam karte hai, lekin yahaan isaki kami nazar ai
 
 
 Although many scenes of the film are filmed very well, that too in a stylish way
 
 
 camere kaa kaam acha he, or priyanka film main acchhee lag rahi hai
 
 
 Irfan's work is good, Ranveer has once again won the game, but seems to be in the old style
 
 
 unhen abhinay main thodaa or sahaj hona chahie tha
 
 
 One thing that strikes the film is that the connection of Bengal and Bangladesh is shown in the film, but none of the characters other than Irrfan have a glimpse of Bengal
 
 
 to agar aapako '70 kaa cinema pasand he or aap sirf or sirf masala film dekhnaa chaahate hai to aap 'gunde' zarur dekh sakate hai
 
 
 My rating for this film is - 3 stars

 Both houses of Parliament passed this reservation bill in just 2 days
 iske baad teen din main raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne is vidheyak ko manjuuri de di thi
 In this, arrangements have been made to provide reservation to general category in educational institutions and government jobs on economic basis

 He wrote, 'we must remember that the BJP has consistently followed the RSS principle of one nation, one leader, one party, one religion, but the Shiv Sena has seen a more inclusive stance in recent times

 The gang rape of a medical student in a moving bus on December 16 in Delhi shook the entire country
 nirbhaya ke saath us din jo kuch hua use jaanakar ab baaki duniya bhi stabdh he
 According to the Daily Mail report, when the story of 23-year-old Nirbhaya was shown on stage through a play at the world's most prestigious art festival, everyone was shaken
 dakshin africa kii mashhoor theatre diarector yel farbar ne edenburg frinz festival main apane nae naatak 'nirbhaya' kaa manchan kiya
 Thousands of spectators stood there and applauded the play
 nirbhaya naam ke is naatak main yon shoshan se peedit paanch anya bhartiya mahilaon kii kahani ko bhi darshaya gaya he
 The special thing is that the same women have played characters in the play whose stories are included in it
 ve naatak ke dauraan bataati hai ki kis tarah nirbhaya kii maut ne unhen chuppi todane ke liye prerit kiya
 According to Farber, 'we included real stories in the play
 hamane nirbhaya kii jindagi or maut ko jeevant kiya, jo paanch anya mahilaon kii kahani ke ird-gird buni gai thi
 Our aim is to break the silence
 is naatak ko sabase taqatvar jo cheez banaati he vah yah he ki isamen har ek kirdaar apni khud kii kahani bayaan kar rahaa he
 He said, "the three women involved in the play are professional actors
 is naatak main bal utpeedan, balaatkaar or dahej ke liye dulhan ko aag main jhonkne jaise maamle shaamil kiye gaye hai
 In one case, the woman's husband and brother-in-law set her on fire for dowry
 or jab vah aspataal main thi tab uske sasuraal vaale bete ko uske paas chhod gaye or phir usne unhen kabhi nahin dekha
 "asked why he felt the need to stage the rape and murder incident of a Delhi student," he said, "in both India and South Africa, rape is seen as a result of respect for the victim
" or peedit se meraa matlab mahila or purush donon se hai kyonki purushon ke saath bhi balaatkaar hote hai
 This is not a feminist issue, but a human rights issue
 rape ek aisa aparaadh he jisamen peedit ko hi jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 But what happened that night in Delhi's bus became clear that we can no longer bring this lie further in the patriarchal society
 'haalanki yah naatak bharat main ho rahe yon aparaadhon par aadhaarit he, lekin farbar kahati hai ki yah sirf bharat kaa masalaa nahin, balki aisa baaki duniya main bhi ho rahaa he
 She says, 'rape cases are increasing in the United States and Britain too

 " "pariwaron main bikharaav kitni badi samasya banakar ubhar rahaa he, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki america main har teen main se ek vyakti sautele parivaar main rah rahaa he or ab bharat main bhi aise pariwaron kii sankhya bad rahi he
 Professor Anand Kumar, dean of the School of Social Sciences of the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University, under the guise of "autonomous individualism", said on the issue that the economic and cultural system in Europe and America gave birth to such step-families
 Special contributions have been made and a family unit has been replaced by "autonomous individualism"
 unhone bataaya ki ‘‘swytt vyaktvaad’’ vyavastha main sautele parivaar kii avadharana ko aasaani se sweekaar kar liya jaataa he lekin bharat jaise desh main jahaan aaj bhi paariwarik ikai main aadhuniktaa ke sthaan par paaramparikta ko adhik mahatv diya jaataa he vahaan ise swikaarne kii drushti se sthiti adhik pechida he
 America's blended 'family', because this problem is coming to India from European and American countries, then it becomes necessary to compare it
 ek anumaan ke anusaar aaj america main har tisare main se ek vyakti sautele parivaar main rah rahaa he or nikat bhavishya main 50 fisadi se adhik america apane jivan kaal main kabhi na kabhi sautele parivaar kaa hissaa banane ko majaboor honge
 Today, 33 percent of children are growing up in step-families
 is prakaar ke pariwaron ko america main ‘‘blendid family’’ bhi kaha jaataa he
 Prof
 Kumar says that in Europe and America, how the institution of family name has disappeared, it can be estimated from this that there has been "atomization of personal life", that is, there is a lot of privacy in privacy
 is
 bharat bhi achoota nahinvah kehete hai ki bharat main abhi is ‘‘vyactik jindagi main aanvikaran’’ kii shuruuaat nahin hui he lekin ise adhik samay tak taala ja sakegaa, aisa bhi nahin he
 The situation now is that of "radical Departure" and this situation will come one day
 pro
 Kumar says this is bound to happen due to rising divorces, women's empowerment and changing sociocultural values
 paariwarik lagaav main samasyasautele parivaar agar badalati jindagi kii sachaai hai to aise main bhaavnaatmak sambandhon kii agni pariksha kaa swaroop kaisaa hoga
 a 1998 survey conducted in the US on this issue showed that step parents and stepchildren take at least four years to establish an emotional attachment to a new family, new environment, and the younger the child, This process is less complicated
 america main ‘‘step family de’’is sambandh main 70 ke dashak main aayi basu chatarji kii film ‘‘khatta meetha’’ kaa zikr karnaa rochak ho saktaa he jisamen do sautele pariwaron kii isi samasya ko naatakeey or chatakile andaaj main pesh kiya gaya tha
 The way this problem is growing today, it seems that this film was made with a lot of vision
 haalanki yah parde par utani safal nahin rahi
 Significantly, every year in America, "step Family Day" is celebrated on 16 September
 is din sautele pariwaron ke sabhi sadsy , bachche buudhe, sabhi milakar ekasaath kisi samaaroh kaa aayojan karte hai or rishton ko nayi garmaahat dene kii koshish karte hai
 Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge termed the Centre's decision to send CBI Director Alok Verma on leave as illegal and a violation of the CBI Act
 narendra modi sarkaar ke is faisle ke khilaaf shanivaar ko khadge ne ucchtam nyaayalay main yachika daayar kii he or is aadesh ko nirast karne kii maang kii he
 Kharge, a Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, said in the petition that according to the Act, the three-member statutory committee of the Leader of Opposition, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice is empowered to appoint or remove the CBI Director
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kendriya satarkta ayog (sivisi) ke paas sibiai nideshak ke khilaaf karrwai kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 Explain that Kharge is also a member of the committee appointing the CBI Director, being the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha
 Filed a petition before SC requesting them to quash order of Centre because it's illegal¬ only illegal they should've called meeting of all 3-PM, CJI & me

 Have you ever thought that the weight of some people starts to increase without eating unhealthy things, then how do some people remain absolutely slim after eating everything? If not then you will know now
 darasal, haal hi main hui ek study kii report main bataaya gaya he ki jo log bina kuch mehnat kiye hi slim rahete hai, uske liye unki genes (genes) jimmedaar hoti hai
 This study has been done by researchers from the University of Cambridge
 study ke dauraan shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki kuch logon main genes kii series maujuud hoti he, jo unke metabolism ko badhaati hai yaa phir sharir ke fat ko teji se kam karti hai
 During the study, these jeans were found in about 1,600 healthy and slim people
 haalanki, kuch logon main in genes ke hone se unki khaane main dilchaspee kam dekhi gai
 This is also one reason for such people to be thin
 vahiin, study main shaamil 40 fisadi patale logon ne bataaya ki unhen khaane kaa bahut shauk he
 They eat everything they want, yet their weight does not increase
 shodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki kuch logon main khaas tarah kii genes hoti hai
 They will have to study to check these jeans, through which they will be able to find out how their body works after eating more
 shodhakartaaon ke mutabik, is study kii madad se ve aisi dawaai kii khoj kar sakenge, jisase mote log apane vajan ko control main rakh sakenge
 Senior author of the study Professor Sadaf Farooqui said, 'during the study we found that some thin people have less desire to eat, due to their jeans
 lekin kuch logon ne hamen bataaya ki ve bahut zyada khate hai, lekin phir bhi unka vajan badhata nahin he
 This clearly shows that some people have such jeans, which do not allow weight gain even after eating more
 'shodhakartaaon ke mutabik, patale or healdi log isliye patale rahete hai, kyonki unamem vajan badhaane vaali genes kam hote hai
 Let me tell you, in the largest study done on jeans of skinny people, the researchers included such people of British who were thin and healthy
 study ke liye shodhakartaaon ne 1,622 patale logon ke saliva kaa sample liya
 This was then compared to the jeans of about 10,000 normal-weight and about 2,000 obese people
 nateezon main palatepan kaa sambandh genes se paaya gaya
 This study has been published in PLOS Genetic Journal
 is study main bataaya gaya he ki 18 fisadi patlaapan hamaare DNA ke kaaran hota he
 Researchers point out that DNA plays an important role in a person being thin or fat

 khabar thi ki is talaak kii evaj main malaika ne arbaj se 15 karod rupee vasule hai
 On this, there is a ruckus about Malaika on social media
 feel good fabric naam ke yujar nemlika kii tasvirper coment kiya he- aajkal kii mahilaayein aisa hi karti hai
 She marries a rich boy and then divorces him for a hefty sum
 phir in paison se ve aish karti hai
 The user has commented on Malaika that when she is able to earn herself then why did she need alumnae
 yujar ne likhaa he- main logon kii izzat karata hum lekin kisi ling kii nahin
 The same user has written in another comment - Now Malaika's life has become only to wear short clothes, go to gym and salon, spend holidays
 kya tumhaare paas sahi main koi kaam he yaa keval apane pati ke paison par aish kar rahi ho?may main hua talaak, malaika ne liye 15 karod2017 main may main arbaj ormalaika kaa talakaua he
 Both were married in 1997 and they also have a son Arhan Khan
 bataaya gaya tha ki malaika ko kaaphi samay se arbaj ke asafal kariyar se pareshaani thi
 For many years, Arbaaz lived under Salman's umbrella, Malaika was known as Nagavara
 is baat kaa bhi khulaasa kiya gaya ki malaika ko hameshaa se arbaj ke parivaar main ek ajanabi samajha jane kaa ahsaas rahata tha, yahaan tak ki malaika is baat kaa bhi zikr kar chuki hai ki salmaan khan ko unke dress sens, unke doston or kai chizon ko lekar dikkat rahati thi
 For all these things Arbaaz and Malaika continued to be in conflict for many years
 is talaak ke liye malaika ne apane or bete ke kharch ke liye 15 karod rupee liye the
 While still meeting the family, Malaika and Arbaaz meet each other even after Talak, while Malaika Khan is very close to the family
