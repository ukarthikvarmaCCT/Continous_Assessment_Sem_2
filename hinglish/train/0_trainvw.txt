 rafel ko lekar bhi saadhaa nishaanaa
 
 
 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over Rafael
 unhone kaha ki modi ko laga ki aasmaan main badal chhaae hue hai

 do baar up-mukhyamantri rahe ol jharkhand students union (ageesu) pramukh sudesh mahato jharkhand main bijepi ke netritv vaali sarkaron main akasar kingmekar kii bhoomika nibhaa chuke hai
 Beginning as the leader of a party with two mlas at the time of the formation of the state, Sudesh is currently the head of a party with six mlas in the 82-member assembly
 rajya main yah ek thik-thaak sankhya he, lekin sudesh ne vipaksh main baithna hi uchit mana he
 He is the only leader who has decided to sit in the opposition instead of joining the jmm-led governments in a period of upsurge in state politics
 unke saamne vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle kai chunautiyaan hai, kyonki unki party loksabhaa chunaav main ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai
 But Sudesh is confident of returning to the assembly elections
 unhone india today ke assistant editor amitabh shrivastav se baat kii
 Excerpts: The Lok Sabha election was not good for your party
 aap nateezon ko kis tarah dekhte hai?yah loksabhaa kaa chunaav tha
 In this, people mainly voted to change the government at the center
 log upie sarkaar se behad naaraaz the
 There were many reasons for this, such as inflation, unemployment, corruption
 isliye logon ne endie ko vot diya
 AJSU had a strong challenge in this election as a regional party
 kai pramukh nirvachan kshetron main hamane acha pradarshan kiya
 a large number of youth and women voted for us
 is chunaav se hamen party ke uddeshyon ko saamne rakhane main bhi madad mili
 What lessons were learned from the Lok Sabha elections? The lessons are clear
 log chaahate hai ki unki buniyadi jaruraton par dhyaan diya jaae
 Government should give any result
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ji janata ke asantosh ko apane paksh main bhunaane main puri tarah safal rahe
 He made a lot of promises by controlling inflation, developing skill and employment among youth, curbing corruption and returning the country back to the path of fast development
 modi ji kii sarkaar ko maine shubhakamanaayen di hai, ummid karata hum ki ve apane vaadon ko puraa karne kaa prayaas karenge
 Will AJSU make a comeback in the assembly elections? AJSU will definitely do well in the assembly elections
 ye chunaav sthaneey muddon par lade jaaenge
 Unlike the general elections, people see us as a strong choice in the state
 pradesh ko vishesh rajya ke darje kii hamaari maang logon ke dimag main he
 Our stand is clear
 hamaara maananaa he ki yahaan kii jameen or uske sansadhano par yahaan kii janata kaa haq he
 People should get equal share of profit from land
 jharkhand ke liye aapaki party kaa kya agenda he?apane gathan ke baad se pradesh galat vajahon se khabaron main rahaa he
 We want to change both people's perception and reality about it
 yahaan vikaas kii apaar sambhaavnaaen hai
 With permanent government and sincere efforts, AJSU wants to bring it on the path of sustainable development
 sirf khanij vaala rajya na rahakar bijli or ispaat ke saamaan aadi kaa utpaadak ban yah hamaare aarthik agenda par aage bad saktaa he
 We can employ them by creating opportunities in industry, infrastructure and agriculture, and by educating and skilled youth
 bhavishya main rajya kii raajnneeti main ageesu kii kya bhoomika hogi?ageesu jharkhand nirmaan ke liye bana tha
 We achieved this goal in 2000 after a long struggle
 par yah ab bhi majboot sarkaar ke liye taras rahaa he
 Our message to the voters of the state is clear: You have seen every kind of government in the last 14 years
 hamen sirf ek varsh dijie
 We will show how good government is run
 main bharosa dilaataa hum ki yuvaaon ko acchhee shiksha or sammanjanak rojgaar milegaa
 Women will get employment and security
 garibon ko swasthya or anya suvidhaayen milengi
 The difference will start to appear in just one year
 aap jharkhand ke liye vishesh rajya kaa darja maangate rahe hai
 Do you think this type of issue will affect voters? We have not demanded special state status for votes
 ham ise apana adhikaar samajhate hai
 This demand is directly related to the rights of the people
 jameen, pani, jangal or khanijon par hamaara adhikaar he
 These rights will provide us livelihood
 hamaara palaayan rukegaa
 Basic amenities like roads, electricity, drinking water, schools and hospitals will be available
 jha ageesu yuvaaon kii party ke rup main jaani jaati he
 But a large number of youth have voted for the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 aap unhen waapas kaise laaenge?jharkhand ke yuva hameshaa se hamaare saath rahe hai
 As i said earlier, the assembly elections will be fought on the issues of the state
 rajya ke yuva yah jaanate hai ki sirf ageesu hi unke or sabhi virgon ke samaveshi vikaas kii soch rakhti he
 They will give us their mandate
 jharkhand naksal prabhavit rajya he
 How will you bring them back into the mainstream? Peace is the first condition for the development of the state
 naksali hinsa main ham kai achche netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko ganvaa chuke hai
 Through real development, we will remove the feeling of injustice and exploitation within a large section
 hamaari party gumraah yuvaaon se baatcheet karegi
 We understand the need for their rehabilitation

 In the era of demonetisation, now you will have to pay 10 times the price for treatment in AIIMS, but if you have registered through Aadhaar Card, then you will not have to pay the registration fee of Rs 10 in AIIMS

 It is not that without Aadhaar card you will not get treatment in AIIMS, but if you do not have Aadhaar card, you will have to pay full 100 rupees instead of 10 rupees

 co / skdzqhs23y hamane bihar uniwarsity kaa maamla uthaaya tha ki do lakh se bhi zyada chaatro ke imtahaan nahin ho rahe hai
 It is now known that the number of affected students can be between 5 to 6 lakhs
 kya yah mumkin he ki lakhon chaatro ko is tarah barbaad kiya jaae or inke maa baap yaa kisi ko fark hi na pade
 What do these boys do again? whatsap karte hai yaa khud ko barbaad hone de rahe hai
 The university has announced the exam date after prime time
 june ke antim saptaah main bie first year or second year kii pariksha shuru hogi
 According to local newspapers, a tender to print the question paper has been issued with this
 principal ke saath baithak hui he ki garmi kii chuttee main pariksha hogi to sahyog karen
 Cooperation should be suspended by law
 agar ham prime time main is par jor nahin dete to yakeen jaaniye pariksha hoti hi nahin
 Let me show you the story and picture of a college
 tasviir se aap dekhie ki kya haal he, kahani se ye samajhie ki kaise noujvaan barbaad he
 This is Radhakrishna Goenka College of Sitamarhi district
 radhakrishna ji vyapaaree thi
 Payed teachers from his pocket for many years
 is college main 10,000 ladke padhate hai
 There should be 69 teachers but only 13 are there
 kai course kii koi class hi nahin hoti he
 When we talked to a senior officer of the college, he said that nothing can be done by our pressure
 aap mukhyamantri or rajyapal se kyon nahin baat karte hai
 Children also create pressure, but the university does not mind
 2014-16 ke piji satr kii pariksha nahin hui he
 When the boys here go to work outside, the question is asked, what was the reason for doing the two-year course in four years? vishvavidhyalay ke ravaiye se sabhi chaatr naaraaz chal rahe hai, pichley do saal se piji ke first, second semester ke chaatr intjaar kar rahe hai ki hamaari pariksha kii jaae lekin yahaan pariksha to kya yahaan date bhi nahin nikaala ja rahaa he
 Students are upset to the extent that they will be forced to commit suicide
 grajuation paanch saal or piji chaar saal main hoga to chaatr naukari paane ke liye kahaan jaaenge
 a date has been given by the university, but still the date has not been determined from when to when the examination will be done
 isse piji ke chaatro main rosh he
 PG students have been discouraged by this
 tippaniyan If we remove the teacher-student ratio in colleges in Bihar, there will be grassroots
 bihar hi nahin duusare rajyon kaa bhi
 Just one teacher at 199 students
 is samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin karke, aapako bataaya ja rahaa he ki uniwarsity kii ranking hogi
 Why vacancy is not coming out, teachers will be recruited, unemployment will go away, children who have taken admission by paying fees will get master
 magar aap log bhi is jhaanse main aa gaye hai ki uniwarsity kii ranking kaa nikalnaa koi bahut baari kaam he jo ho gaya he
 There is a college in Motihari, Shri Narayan Singh College
 yahaan ek hi shikshak hai, jo khud principal hai
 There is no teacher in any course

 It has been ten months since the SSC CGL 2016 exam passed but no more than 3000 tax assistants are being appointed
 ek chaatr ne bataaya ki 'mere papa ne mujhe padhaane ke liye apni dukaan bech di
 We were very happy when the result came
 papa ke paas ab kuch nahin bachaa he
 Now-a-days, father takes money on interest from one and after some time from someone else
 kabhi kabhi ghar main khaane ke paise nahin hote to mummy ek shaam kaa khaanaa nahin banaati
 Mummy has also started taking loans from small finance companies
 hamane sochaa tha ki naukari lag gai he to mata pita ko raahat denge
 Papa has also stopped asking when the job will take off
 ye hair post par baithe log kya samajhenge ki ham jaise log kaise ji rahe hai
 ' agast 2017 main riselt aa gaya tha
 He has not joined May 2018
 main pichley ek hafte se rose iskaa zikr karata hum is ummid main ki dinemic vitt mantri piyush goyal inaki naukari kara denge magar kuch nahin hua
 Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has tweeted for these troubled students but nothing happened after that
 sarkaar ne chaar saal hone par bahut se vigyaapan chaape hai, un vigyapanon ko phir se padhiega, kya unamem 3287 chaatro kii koi vyathaa he, kya 3287 naujavaanon ko das maheene se apointment letters kaa na milanaa badi khabar nahin he, kaise nahin he, netaaon ke bakawaas bayanon se kahin zyada badi khabar he

 Asked whether Bhutia can be compared to Tendulkar, Houghton jokingly said, "baichung has won a celebrity dance competition in India, he is a celebrity in India
 ’’ haatan ne haalanki bahrain ke khilaaf bharat ke duusare match kii purv sandhya par kaha ki donon khilaadi apane apane khel ke adarsh hai

 Tendulkar is a very good model and a great person

 By the way, do you know the real reason for the return of the node
 
 
 kapil sharma kaa kamedi sho pehle jis channel par aata tha, us par gutthi kaa kirdaar behad popular tha
 Sunil Grover used to play it and this also brought him popularity
 lekin channel se anban ke baad jab kapil duusare channel par'da kapil sharma sho'lekar laute to unki team to saath ai lekin gutthi peeche hi chhot gai
 But in the recent Kapil Sharma show, the audience got a surprise
 kyonki gutthi laut ai thi
 Now you must be wondering what is the secret behind 'the Kapil Sharma Show'
 
 
 jaane kya rishta he 'i dil he mushkil' or salmaan khan main
 
 
 So know that the knot was returned for her love and husband
 maajaraa ye he ki'da kapil sharma sho'ke is episod main ranbir kapur aae the diwali par aane vaali apni film'i dil he mushkil'kii pramotion ke liye
 Now in the earlier show, we have already seen how much Gutthi was stuck on Ranbir and had dated him and was also going to have a child

 However, in this episode of 'the Kapil Sharma Show' featuring Gutthi Returns, care was taken that they should not get caught in any legal case

 The appointment of Srikanth Srinivasan, a famous Indian-origin legalist in the US, has been confirmed as a judge in the country's second highest court
 seenet ne shrinivasana kii niyukti kii pushti kar he
 There were 97 votes in favor of his appointment
 is pushti ke baad 46 saal ke shrinivasana upree adaalat ke pehle bhartiya-america nyaayadhish ban gaye hai
 He was first nominated by US President Barack Obama on June 11, 2012
 haalanki seenet ke anischitkaal ke liye sthagit ho jane kii vajah se 2 janvari, 2013 ko unka namakan raashtrapati ke paas laut aayaa tha
 He was then re-nominated to the same office by Obama on January 3, 2013
 tippaniyan Barack Obama, while praising Srinivasan, said that he will hold the post of Judge 'with distinction' in the top second court of America
 46-varshiya shrinivasana pehle dakshin asian hai, jinaki sheersh america adaalat main niyukti hui he
 Obama said in a statement that Srinivasan is a guide
 ab vah vishistataa ke saath fedral bench kii seva karenge
 Born in Chandigarh, India, and raised in Lawrence, Kansas, Srinivasan served as an outstanding litigator (litigant) for nearly two decades before becoming the Principal Deputy Solicitor General of the US
 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne 11 june, 2012 ko unhen pehali baar namankit kiya tha
 However, his nomination returned to the President on January 2, 2013, as the Senate adjourned sine die
 iske baad 3 janvari, 2013 ko obama ne unhen usee karyaalay main dobaaraa namankit kar diya tha
 The comments baraak obama ne shrinivasana kii tarif main kaside padhate hue kaha ki vah america kii sheersh duusari adaalat main 'vishistataa ke saath' nyaayadhish kaa pad sanbhaalenge
 The 46-year-old Srinivasan is the first South Asian to be appointed to a top US court

 In China, the world's most populous country, no laxity is being taken against corruption, due to which the corrupt people have been emboldened
 vahaan par bhrashtachar ke maamle saamne aate hi karrwai kii jaati he or bhrashtachar main shaamil logon ko desh se bhaagane kaa mauka hi nahin miltaa he
 This is the reason why corruption in China has also reduced to a great extent in the last few years
 neerav modi ke baadachinamen ek insurance company main farjivade kaa maamla saamne aayaa, to vahaan kii sarkaar turant harakat main ai or badi karrwai kii
 According to the Chinese newspaper Global Times, View Xiaohui, former CEO of Anbang Insurance Group, has been charged after a corruption case surfaced in China
 saath hi china insurance regulatory kamishan group ke kaarobaar ko bhi ek saal ke liye puri tarah apane haath main lene ja rahi he
 This will also stop the way for the accused to send money abroad and escape and it is not possible for the accused to escape the punishment
 jahaan ek ore bharat main kareeb saadhe 11 hajaar karod rupee ke ghotaale ko anjaam dene ke baad neerav modi or mehuch chokasee jaise aaropee faraar ho jate hai, to vahiin china main bhrashtachar ke aropiyon ke liye bachakar bhaagna aasaan nahin hota he
 After being implicated in a corruption case, he is sent straight to jail
 china kii sarkaar kii chaukasee or sakhti ke chalate aropiyon ke liye bhrashtachar maamle main sajaa se bhi bachanaa sambhav nahin hai
 This is the reason that in recent times, by taking action in the case of corruption, China has also controlled it to a great extent
 vahiin, bharat main vijay maalya, lalit modi or phir neerav modi jaise bhrashtachari ghotaalaa karte hai or videsh nikal jate hai
 The interesting thing is that governments have also changed in India on corruption, but here, in the name of action, there is only pretense
 isaki vajah se bhrashtachariyon ke hausale buland hai
 After assuming power in 2012, President Xi Jinping launched a massive campaign against corruption
 unhone bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jiro tolerance kii niti apanaai
 In the last six years, his government sent many officials and leaders involved in corruption to jail
 isamen se zyaadaatar adhikari aaj bhi china kii jail main hawa kha rahe hai
 Earlier, corruption was high in China, but it has decreased significantly since Xi Jinping's strictness
 bhrashtachar index main bhi china kii ranking main sudhaar hua he
 a new research led by an Indian scientist has found that in the massive blackhole of the galaxy, a bubble of gas dissolved six million years ago and then a huge bubble weighing millions of suns came out
 rongaman bordoloi or cambridge sthit emiti main unke anusandhankartaaon ke dal ne nasa ke habbal spasteleskopaki madad se paaya ki akashganga ke gahare blike hole se nikali gaison ke gubaar yani fermi bables ke uttari adrdh hisse se kai sudur kwasron ko dekha ja saktaa he
 The Hubble Space Telescope tested quasar light to obtain information about the speed of the gas and to detect whether the gas was approaching or moving away from Earth
 padaarth kii gati ke aadhaar par shodh dal ne yah akalan kiya ki ek urjapurna ghatana se bane ye bulbule lagbhag 60 se 90 lakh saal pehle bane the
 Bordoloi said, "A human life can take a long period of 60 to 9 million years, but if we look at the space period, it is like blinking an eyelid
" is maapak kaa andaja dene ke liye aapako bataa duun ki brahmad lagbhag 13
 7 billion years old and dinosaurs around 6
 6 karod saal pehle lupt ho gaye the
 So the last grass in the massive black hole of the galaxy was after the extinction of the dinosaurs
 unhone kaha, hamane pehali baar inamen se ek bulbule main thandi gas kii gati kaa pataa lagaaya he
 This allows us to measure the velocity of the gas and calculate when bubbles were formed
 bordoloi ne kaha, ye behad shaktishaalee or urjawan ghatana thi
 Perhaps it happens that a gulp of gas goes into a black hole, causing matter to erupt and become double parts of hot gas
 ye eks-re or gamma-re sambandhi paryvekshanon main dekhe gaye
 The black hole has been swallowing things since then
 blike hole antariksh kaa ek saghan or thos kshetra he, jisamen gurutviya kshetra hota he
 The spiritual field is so intense that no substance or light can escape
 hamaare taramandal ke centre main sthit vrihad blike hole ne surya jaise 45 lakh taron ke dravyaman ko sampidit karke antariksh ke ek behad chote se kshetra main tabdeel kar diya he
 When Bordoloi was asked when the next grass of the Blackhole would go into it, he told PTI, recently, a Githora-like G2 had come very close to falling into a massive black hole at the center of the Ganges, the mass of the Earth's manifold mass
 lekin kisi tarah ye batch gaya or gira nahin
 He said, by studying the gas flow inside and outside the constellation, we can study the future of Akash Ganga
 ham yah purvanumaan lagaana shuru kar sakate hai ki yah nae taron kaa srijan karti rahegi yaa nahin? yaa phir yah isamen gas kii aapurti khatm ho jaaegi or yah ek purana evam mrit taramandal ban jayega
 At this time every year there is negligible birth of any new star in the galaxy
 aagaamee chunautiyon ke sambandh main unhone kaha, hamaare saamne ek badi chunauti asal main ye dekhnaa he ki kin saidhantik purvanumaanon kii madad se yahaan dekhe ja rahe paryvekshanon kii vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 He said, we are conducting new Hubble inspection in this area and it is expected that many new startling results will come out of them

 Dawood's brother Anees Ibrahim has said this to Aaj Tak

 Iqbal Kaskar, the younger brother of Dawood Ibrahim, the underworld don, was attacked at around 9:30 pm last night
 ikbaal kaskar hamale ke vakt dakshini mumbai ke mohammad ali road ilaake ke pakmodiya street par apane driver ke saath maujuud tha

 Although 2 attackers escaped, the two shooters involved in the attack have been arrested by the police

 After the attack, Mumbai Crime Branch took Iqbal Kaskar with him
 kuch ghanton kii poochtacha ke baad wo waapas surakshit apane ghar pahunch chukaa he
 The biggest question is, who did it and why did the attack of Dawood's strongman attack on his own younger brother enter Mumbai's stronghold
 anderworld se ikbaal kaa rishta nahin he, phir bhi hamale kaa kya he makasad
 These are all such questions, which are very important to answer, because even the Mumbai Police is apprehensive that the gang-war which has been stalled on the streets of Mumbai for years may not catch up again

 ham is ore sabhi pakshon or dalon se baat kar rahe hai- ham sab se baat karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 We have also asked the Chief Minister to talk to everyone - We cannot accept the slogan of 'pakistan Zindabad' in India - No power of the world can snatch Jammu and Kashmir from us - All party meeting on Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi on August 12 It has been called - i am not right to use non-lethal weapons in the valley, but it has been used before - security forces have been asked to exercise restraint in the valley
 - The state government is focusing on meeting the basic needs in the violence areas - On 23 and 24 July and visiting Anantnag and Srinagar, i met several delegations - 4515 security forces personnel were injured in Kashmir violence, while the number of injured civilians 3356 - 2656 patients admitted to hospitals during violence in the state, unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri sansad main bane apane offis main subah 10 baje aa jate hai or shaam ko 6 baje tak rahete hai, lekin sadan main ahm muddon par charchaa main shaamil nahin hote
 He demanded the PM to make a statement in Parliament on the attack on Dalits and the issue of Kashmir
 rajyasabha main kashmir mudde par charchaa ke bich sadan ko do baje tak ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 In the PMO, Minister Jitendra Singh said, 'it is being said again and again that since the time BJP came, why has nothing happened for a quarter of a year?' On Kashmir issue, it was decided for four hours to discuss the House

 Even before the results of the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has started preparations to celebrate the victory
 dilli bijepi ne ek 7 kilo kaa laddu kek order kiya he jise nateezon ke baad shaam ko jashn ke taur par kaata jayega
 Apart from this cake, 9 cakes of 4-5 kg have been ordered to be cut at the BJP central office
 taiyaariyon se saaf he ki bijepi is chunaav main apni jeet ko lekar aashwast he
 The reason for this is that the exit poll results are also indicating the BJP getting an absolute majority
 dilli main loksabhaa kii saat siten hai jinamein se pichley chunaav main sabhi siton par bijepi ne jeet darj kii thi
 This time the contest in Delhi seems triangular because apart from BJP and Congress, the ruling Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi has also entered the election with full emphasis

 What the Exit Poll says According to Aaj Tak's Exit Poll, the Congress seems to be winning more than the 44 seats it won in 2014, but what they hoped for from Priyanka Gandhi's arrival would not be fulfilled at the moment

 Here, before the results, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu is constantly trying to unite the entire opposition
 arvind kejariwal ek baar phir dilli ke mukhyamantri ban gaye
 Ramlila Maidan once again witnessed his oath
 shapath lete hi kejariwal ne dilli kii janata ke saamne 7 kasame khain
 The biggest promise was - i will work fiercely for 5 years
 tabiyat kharaab hone ke baavjood nae siem pehle hi din se kaam main jute gaye
 Arvind Kejriwal was sworn in as the Chief Minister for the second time in 13 months at the Ramlila Maidan, in a different form of AAP, the AAP government was formed
 yah sanyog hi tha ki pichley saal 14 farvari ko kejariwal ne siem pad se istipha diya
 a year later on February 14, he again became the Chief Minister of Delhi
 fark itnaa he ki 49 din kii kejariwal sarkaar congress ke bharose thi
 This time he has a strong majority
 tabiyat kharaab, par ection main siemshapath ke baad hue kejariwal ke bhaashan main iskaa aks bhi dikhaa
 He was ill, but this time he was restrained, generous and confident
 kejariwal puri tarah se ection main the
 This is the reason why he made 7 vows in front of the people of Delhi in his first speech
 ramlila maidan janalokapal andolan kaa gavaah bana tha
 Kejriwal also vowed to bring Janlokpal from the same ground
 pichley anubhav ne padhaayaa pathbhale kejariwal kii pichhali sarkaar sirf 49 dinon kii thi, lekin tab se ab tak kaa anubhav kaaphi bada tha
 This is the reason that Kejriwal's attitude this time was quite different
 darasal, fal ladane se ped jhuk jate hai
 The impact of bumper majority also showed on Team Kejriwal
 ramlila maidan main shapath grahan samaaroh ke vakt baari bheed thi
 Every color of the victory of the common man was visible
 shapath ke baad apane pehle bhaashan main bhi mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal jameen se jude dikhe
 He described the overwhelming support of the public as a miracle of nature
 kejariwal ne bataaya ki kabhi ve bhi gumaan main the
 But his ego was shattered by the crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 siem ne dikhalaayaa bada dilabada dil dikhaate hue kejariwal ne apane virodhiyon ko bhi yaad kiya
 He said that there is no opponent now
 dilli ke vikaas ke liye kiran bedi or ajay maakan kii bhi madad lenge
 Kejriwal's speech also had a lesson for party workers
 unhone saaf kar diya ki topi pahanakar koi gundgardee karen, to unhen bakhsha na jaae
 Like 2013, this time the program of oath taking was done with simplicity
 tab kejariwal ne dilli se kai vaade kiye the
 This time too
 kejariwal ne kuch nae khwab bhi dikhaae, lekin donon baar ke shapath main kai baaten kaaman raheen
 13 months ago, from the stage of Ramlila, Kejriwal asked Delhiites to sting
 kuch aisa hi suzav abaki baar bhi diya
 Distance from cheap publicity Before the formation of the government in the 2013 assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party promised to end VIP culture from Delhi
 usee vaade ko puraa karne ke liye unhone shapath grahan se pehle metro train kii sawari kii thi
 However this time he did not do so and reached Ramlila Maidan in the car like a common man
 pichhali baar kii tulana main is baar kejariwal ne nape-tule andaaj main sambodhan kiya
 Instead of making a show of promises, this time he was seen insisting on fulfilling it

 aspataal kaa postmortem room
 Arguably a place where the environment can make any human uncomfortable
 ek aisa cameraa jiske andar jane se pehle har kisi ko maansik rup se taiyaar hona padataa he
 But such news has come from a post-mortem room in Madhya Pradesh, which tells the thought of the hungry man and the nature, before which the scene of death also fades

 siwani jila aspataal ke civil sarjan dow
 SN Soni says, 'we have a female doctor here, who was sent for postmortem on Monday
 ek murder cese aayaa tha
 The police request was to send the female doctor along
 maine ek mahila doctor ko doctor mukund vaasanic ke saath postmortem ke liye bheja tha
 After about half an hour, he called me and told me that Dr
 Wasnik had done some indecent act with him, behaved in a very vulgar way, which had led to him being angry
 'civil sarjan kaa kahana he ki unhone shikaayat milane ke fouran baad sambandhit aaropee doctor ko phone lagaaya or aaropon kii baat kii, to unhone ise sire se khaarij kar diya
 Later, the woman doctor complained in writing to the civil surgeon
 mahila doctor kii shikaayat ko jila chikitsaalay kii mahila utpeedan samiti ko saunp diya gaya or uski ek copy police thane ko bhi bhej di gai he
 'I was teaching postmortem' On the other hand, Dr
 Wasnik, the accused in the case, has denied the allegations and said that he was only teaching the post-mortem to the female doctor
 dow
 Mukund Wasnik said, 'when i was starting post mortem, she was talking on the phone outside
 kaaphi der ho gai thi

 The Congress leadership has been consistently saying that their number two leader needs some time to introspect and decide his role in the party and consider the future of the party
 aisi ummid kii ja rahi he ki rahul gandhi is ravivaar ko bhoomi adhigrahan bill ke khilaaf kisaanon kii ek raily ko 19 april ko sambodhit karenge
 Congress has been consistently opposing this bill
 rahul gandhi kii image kisaanon ke hamdard ke rup main ubhari he or aisa mana jaataa he ki saal 2013 ke bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main yah praavdhaan unki vajah se hi laayaa ja sakaa ki kisaanon kii marji ke bagaiyr unki jameen kaa adhigrahan nahin kiya ja saktaa he

 aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki ek anicchhuk rajaneta ke rup main jane-jane vaale rahul gandhi jald hi apni maa sonia gandhi kii jagah party kii kaman apane haath le lenge
 After Rahul went on leave two months ago, there have been many contradictory statements about him within the party
 rahul gandhi par ek behad hi samvedansheel or kathin samay main party ko akelaa chhodane kaa aarope he, khaskar tab jab party 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main mili haar ke baad dilli vivi chunaavon main mili haar ko jhel rahi thi

 shila dikshit se pehle sandip dikshit bhi rahul ko party adhyaksh banaae jane kaa virodh kar chuke the
 It is believed that both Sheila Dixit and her son Sandeep Dixit are not in Rahul Gandhi's goodlist and Team Rahul has replaced Sheila Dixit's arch-rival Ajay Maken

 Uddhav Thackeray's party Shiv Sena will join the BJP government in Maharashtra
 guuruuvaar dopaher donon partiyon ne saajha press conference kii
 Chief Minister Fadnavis said that a total of 12 ministers from the Shiv Sena will take oath
 inamen 5 cabinet or 7 rajya mantri honge
 Chief Minister Fadnavis said that we have been together for 25 years and the alliance of the two parties has been based on ideology
 ham saath main loksabhaa chunaav lade
 We fought the assembly elections separately, but both parties got more votes than Congress and NCP
 unhone kaha ki maharashtra kii janata chahta he ki bijepi or shivasena saath aaen
 He informed that a new committee will be formed which will decide on the seat sharing in the upcoming BMC elections
 haalanki sutara bataa rahe hai ki uddhav kii party centre main ek cabinet or ek rajyamantri kaa pad or chaahati he
 At present, Minister of Heavy Industries in the Central Government Anant Geete is the only face of Shiv Sena
 shuukravaar ko 34 din puraani fadanvis sarkaar kaa vistaar hona he
 New ministers will take oath in the Legislative Complex at four in the evening
 shivasena kii centre main atirikt mantri pad kii maang ko maharashtra main manachaahe pad na milane kii bharpai kii koshish ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The Fadnavis cabinet, which was sworn in as chief minister on October 31, has 8 cabinet and two ministers of state
 baharhaal, shivasena ke ek varisht netaa ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki party anant geete ke alaava modi mantrimandal main ek or mantri ko shaamil karne par jor degi
 The leader said, our claim remains at the center
 ham ummid karte hai ki kuch hoga
 Now who is Shraddha's crow? Remember that before the Maharashtra elections, the old alliance between BJP and Shiv Sena was broken
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan shivasena ne bijepi ke liye 'shraadh ke kauwe' jaise talkh shabdon kaa istemaal kiya tha
 During the election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called Shiv Sena as 'haftavasuli Party' and NCP as 'naturally Corrupt Party'
 lekin sadan main fadanvis sarkaar ne ensipi ke samarthan se 'vivaadit' vishwaas mat hasil kar liya
 The Shiv Sena termed this trust vote as 'fake' and there was a lot of uproar in front of the Governor's car
 lekin donon partiyon ke bich kuch 'ucchstareey' baithkon ke baad bijepi or shivasena ke bich sab kuch thik bataaya ja rahaa he
 This is probably the first time that the major opposition party of a state is going to directly join the government
 shivasena ko grih, awaas, rajasav or urja jaise bade vibhaag nahin milenge
 They can be replaced by departments like water conservation, industry and PWD
 shivasena grih vibhaag chaahati thi, lekin use grih rajya mantri kaa pad mil saktaa he

 mumbai kii haji ali dargah ke aasapaas atikaraman ke maamle main haji ali dargah trust ne supreme court se masjid ko hataane sambandhi aadesh main sanshodhan karne kii guhaar lagaai he
 The trust has filed an application in the Supreme Court, saying that the Kinara Mosque was not involved in the removal of encroachment before the Maharashtra government as it is not on government land
 kinaaraa masjid ko niyamit karne kaa mudda rajya sarkaar kii cameti ke paas vichaaradhin he isliye masjid ko todphod ke daayre se baahar rakhaa jaae or cameti ko maamle ko chaar hafte ke bheetar nipataara karne kaa nirdesh diya jaae
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had asked the Maharashtra government to remove encroachment from the area as per the court's order
 court ne sarkaar se kaha ki hamane pehle bhi yahi kaha tha lekin lagata he ki aap court ke aadesh kaa paalan nahin karnaa chaahate
 You must remove encroachment from the area
 ilaake main kisi ko bhi koi kanoonee sangrakshan praapt nahin he
 In fact, the Maharashtra government argued in the Supreme Court that there is a possibility of deterioration of law and order during the action to remove encroachment in the area
 kyonki isi ilaake main kinaaraa masjid bhi he
 On July 3, the Supreme Court ordered the Maharashtra government to remove the encroachment in the 908 square meter area around the Dargah in two weeks
 court ne kaha tha ki agar aadesh kaa paalan nahin hua to gambhir parinaam honge
 The Maharashtra government had told that it is necessary to beautify around the dargah
 hoicourt ke aadesh ke baad ab supreme court ne bhi aadesh jari kar die hai to aapako yah karnaa hoga
 Earlier the encroachment was removed by the Dargah Trust but there is still encroachment in the area
 ab dargah ne ise hataane main asamarthta jataai he to supreme court ne yah aadesh jari kiya he
 In the case of encroachment in the area of mumbai's Haji Ali Dargah, the Supreme Court had told the BMC that there should be beautification of the Haji Ali Dargah
 biemasi dargah trust ke die saundaryikaran ke plan ko yaa to manjuur kare yaa sanshodhan kare yaa phir khud apana plan bataae
 The court had said that the BMC plan should be filed in the Supreme Court by June 30
 court ne dargah trust ke atikaraman hataane ke kadam kii saraahna kii
 The court has asked the trust to remove the encroachment in four weeks
 dargah trust ne ek saundaryikaran yojana court main saunpi he
 Earlier in the hearing, the court had said that the encroachment in the 737 square meter area near the Dargah would be removed and the Dargah Trust itself would remove the encroachment
 supreme court ne dargah trust ko khud hi atikaraman hataane kii ijaajat di thi
 The Supreme Court had said that the Dargah Trust itself removed encroachments by 8 May
 haalanki court ne kaha tha ki 171 varg meter main bani masjid main todphod nahin hogi
 On the orders of the High Court, the Supreme Court had stayed the demolition action of the Special Task Force for Demolition
 supreme court ne trust ko haji ali ke saundaryikaran or suvidhaon ko badhaane ke liye yojana banaakar dene ko hari jhandi dikhaai thi
 The Supreme Court has ordered that no court will issue any order on this issue
 kisi pakshakaar ko dikkat he to vah supreme court aa saktaa he
 The Supreme Court issued notice to the parties in the High Court
 tippaniyan In fact, on 22 March 2017, the Bombay High Court ordered removal of encroachment in the 908 square meter area here
 haji ali dargah trust ne supreme court main chunauti di thi
 During the hearing, a bench of CJI JS Khehar in the Supreme Court said that he will ban the demolition of 171 square meter area out of 908 meters in which the mosque is located
 lekin trust yah sunishchit kare ki baaki atikaraman ko hataane main vah atharity kii madad karegaa
 He will later hear about the mosque
 supreme court ne kaha he ki haji ali ke paas kaaphi atikaraman he or yah sirf dukaane hai
 People have difficulty in reaching the dargah
 court ne kaha ki dharm ke logon ko atikaraman hataane kii karrwai ko saport karnaa chahie
 It was stated by the Dargah Trust that the order of the High Court is not correct
 yah masjid kaaphi puraani he or 1931 se lij uske paas he
 Demolition orders should be stayed in the High Court area
 trust ne supreme court main arji daakhil kar kaha he ki maharashtra sarkaar ke saamne atikaraman hataane ke maamle main kinaaraa masjid shaamil nahin thi kyonki vah sarkari jameen par nahin he
 The issue of regularizing the Kinara Mosque is under consideration with the state government committee, so the mosque is kept out of the purview of sabotage and the committee is directed to settle the matter within four weeks
 isse pehle supreme court ne maharashtra sarkaar se kaha tha ki court ke aadesh ke mutabik ilaake se atikaraman hataaya jaae
 The court told the government that we had said the same thing earlier but it seems that you do not want to follow the court's order
 aapako ilaake se atikaraman hataanaa hi hoga
 Nobody enjoys any legal protection in the area
 darasal maharashtra sarkaar ne supreme court main daleel di ki ilaake main atikaraman hataane kii karrwai ke dauraan kanoon vyavastha ke bigadane kii ashanka he
 Because in this area there is also the Kinara Mosque
 teen july ko supreme court ne maharashtra sarkaar ko do hafte main dargah ke aasapaas 908 varg meter ilaake main atikaraman ko hataane ke aadesh die the
 The court said that if the order is not followed, there will be serious consequences
 maharashtra sarkaar se kaha tha ki dargah ke aasapaas saundaryikaran karnaa jaruri he
 After the High Court order, now the Supreme Court has also issued orders, then you have to do it
 isse pehle dargah trust ne atikaraman hataaya tha lekin abhi bhi ilaake main atikaraman bachaa he
 Now that the Dargah has expressed its inability to remove it, the Supreme Court has issued this order
 mumbai kii haji ali dargah ke ilaake main atikaraman ke maamle main supreme court ne biemasi se kaha tha ki haji ali dargah kaa saundaryikaran hona hi chahie
 Either approve or amend the beautification plan given by BMC Dargah Trust or tell your own plan
 court ne kaha tha ki 30 june tak biemasi plan supreme court main daakhil kare
 The court appreciated the move to remove the encroachment of the Dargah Trust
 court ne trust se kaha he ki chaar hafte main baaki atikaraman bhi hataae
 The Dargah Trust has submitted a beautification scheme to the court
 isse pehle sunwaayee main court ne kaha tha ki dargah ke paas 737 varg meter ilaake main atikaraman hatenge or dargah trust khud hi atikaraman hataayega
 The Supreme Court allowed the dargah trust to remove encroachments on its own

 27 farvari kii subah jaise hi sabarmati express godhra railway stesan ke paas pahunchi, uske ek coach se aag kii lapten uthne lageen or dhuen kaa gubaar nikalne laga
 a massive fire broke out inside the S-6 coach of the Sabarmati train
 jisase coach main maujuud yatri uski chapet main aa gaye
 Most of them were Karsevaks, returning from a program in Ayodhya under the Ram Mandir movement
 aag se jhulaskar 59 karsevakon kii maut ho gai
 Which gave this event a very political form
 shaam main modi ne bulaai baithkajis vakt ye haadasa hua, narendra modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri the
 The incident was seen as a conspiracy
 ghatana ke baad shaam main hi modi ne baithak bulaai
 All questions arose about the meeting
 aarope lage ki baithak main 'kriya kii pratikriya' hone kii baat saamne ai
 The train fire was considered a conspiracy
 train main bheed dwaara petrol daalkar aag lagane kii baat godhra cond kii jaanch kar rahe naanavati ayog ne bhi maani
 However, on the very next day of the Godhra incident, the matter became turbulent
 28 farvari ko godhra se karsevakon ke shav khule trek main ahmedabad laae gaye
 This incident also became a matter of discussion
 in shavon ko parijanon ke bajaay vishwa hindu parishad ko saunpa gaya
 Soon this incident of Godhra train took the form of riots in Gujarat
 ye dange rajya ke sabhi 26 jilon main fail gaye
 The Islamic Relief Center Gujarat claims that around 500 religious places were damaged in these riots
 rajasthan ek aisa rajya he jahaan congress kii manmohan sarkaar or narendra modi sarkaar ne do baar mitti kii jaanch ke liye mrudaa swasthya card jari kiye
 But even today, in the name of soil investigation, the work of sailing continues
 hamane jab ek mrudaa jaanch ghar kaa daura kiya to vahaan mashin ke naam par dystal water garm karne kii ek mashin or duusari potash kii jaanch ke liye ek mashin he
 While all the investigations are going on here in the government records
 rajasthanmen kul 101 mrudaa jaanch ghar khole gaye the, lekin mrudaa kii jaanch karne vaale krishi vaigyanik nahin mili to inamen se 67 jaanch centre ko sarkaar ne pipipi mod par altisi commercial company privet limited ko saunp diya
 The situation at the Soil Testing Center at the agricultural office of Chaksu, 40 km from Jaipur, was astonishing, where four boys were hired to examine the soil, which is worth five to eight thousand rupees
 inamen se kisi ne mitti jaanch kii training nahin lee he
 These people could not even tell what is harmful to the soil
 vahiin, iaiti electric kii padhai kar vaigyanik bane hanuman sahay ko maatr paanch hajaar kii pagaar milti he
 Their job is to examine the soil and tell which element it is and which crops can be harmed or benefited by it
 lekin inako ye hi nahin pataa ki mitti main koun-koun se micro nutrients hote hai
 At the same time, scientist Devnarayan admitted that he had not studied any of this nor taken training
 jabatak koi duusari naukari nahin lag jaati aath hajaar rupye par yahaan kaam kar rahaa hum
 But the worst was that of Supervisor Rajendra Prajapat who kept telling us till the last that he investigates 'phosphor' here
 aakhir tak wo phosphorus nahin bol paae
 Earlier, this whole matter has also come before the state agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini
 unhone jaanch kar kaarywahi ke aadesh bhi die the
 But till now a similar investigation is going on
 jo hamane dekha wo duusare jile main khud mantriji dekh chuke hai
 But nothing has changed
 rajasthan kekrishi mantriprabhulaal saini kaa kahana he ki hamane do lab kii jaanch kii thi or paaya tha ki vahaan jaanch karne waalon ko pataa hi nahin tha ki jo jaanch kar rahe hai wo he kya? yahaan tak kii hajaaron sample ke dher lagaae hue the
 All this work is on PPP mode and the company gets 127 rupees for testing each sample
 itnaa hi nahin in centres ke bare main kisaanon ko bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Nobody has even made a soil health card
 rajasthan main manmohan sarkaar ke dauraan 30 lakh 32 hajaar mrudaa swasthya card jari kiye gaye the
 After coming to power, Prime Minister Modi relaunched it and during the BJP government this number has increased to 77 lakhs

 The freedom to ask questions about the functioning of the government is the test of democracy
 2005 main paarit soochna kaa adhikaar (artiai) kanoon bharat ke nagarikon ko apni sarkaar se sawaal poochne kaa haq detaa he
 Because of this, people have not depended only on elections to hold their governmental actors accountable
 desh bhar main har saal 60 lakh soochna kii argiyaan daakhil kii jaati hai
 These make the RTI law the most used law among the transparency laws around the world
 rashtriya aakalnon ne dikhaaya he ki in argiyon kaa ek bada hissaa sabase garib or saadhanheen log daakhil karte hai
 This is perhaps because they understand the tremendous potential of the RTI Act that it empowers them to regain their basic rights and entitlements, especially when there is no effective grievance redressal mechanism to correct services failure
 is
 misaal ke liye, jab dilli main jhuggi bastiyon ke bashindon ko unke hisse kaa sabsidi vaala sasta rashan nahin mila or bahaanaa bana diya gaya ki sarkaar ne hi rashan dukaanon ko anaaj kii supplai nahin kii he, to un logon ne artiai kanoon kaa istemaal kiya or unki dukaanon ke masik stock register hasil kar liye
 These documents exposed indiscriminate corruption in the public distribution system and successfully used them to hold officials accountable in ensuring proper distribution of ration
 isi tarah logon ne is kanoon kaa istemaal nunatam mazdooree, pension, swasthya seva, shiksha, pani kii supplai or saaf-safai kaa pratipaadan sunishchit karne ke liye kiya he
 The RTI Act has initiated the much-needed task of power-sharing in the democratic set-up and metamorphosis of the relationship between citizens and government
 log desh ke sabase oonche ohadon ke kaamkaaj, unke faislon or yahaan tak ki unke aacharan par bhi sawaal uthaane ke liye is kanoon kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Information has been sought about the educational qualifications of the Prime Minister and the expenses incurred on his foreign travels, the information of the assets of the judges of the Supreme Court and the names of the companies which have not paid the debt of public sector banks have also been obtained
 yah paardarshita kanoon vyapam ghotaale or adarsh ghotaale sareekhee bhrashtachar kii badi kalank kathaon ko ujagar karne main madadgaar sabit hua he
 Human rights excesses have been questioned, including deaths in police encounters and missing lives
 haal hi main artiai kanoon ke jariye hasil jaankariyon kaa istemaal sarkari kartadhartaaon ke jhuthe daavon kii kalai kholane ke liye kiya gaya
 When the Prime Minister and the Minister of Human Resource Development claimed a saving of thousands of crores of rupees due to Aadhaar — it was said that because of Aadhaar, 4 crore fake ration cards and 80,000 fake teachers of universities were detected — questions were asked on their claims went
 saboot pesh karne main naakaam sarkaar harakat main ai or nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye usne spashtikaran jari kiye or yahaan tak sansad kii kaarywahiyon main bhi sudhaar kiya
 Similarly, the great success of demonetisation claims could not stand up to the queries of those using RTI
 takat kaa aujaarartiai kanoon kii takat kaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki iske tahat jaanch-padtaal se khud ko bachaane ke liye sansthaaon ne jameen-aasmaan ek kar diya
 In March 2010, the Supreme Court itself appealed and challenged the Delhi High Court's decision in which it had asked for disclosure of information related to the assets of the Supreme Court judges in response to an RTI application
 yah maamla ab bhi lambit he!desh ke har naagarik ko sarkari filein or record dekhne kaa haq dekar artiai kanoon ne 1
 Has created an army of 3 billion potential whistleblowers and auditors
 paaramparik taur par yah bhoomika sarkaar main karyrat karinde hi nibhaate the
 What is more surprising then is that those who used this law to show the truth to the government, often paid the price for it
 bhrashtachar tathaa satta ke durupyog kaa pardaafash karne ke liye is kanoon kaa sahaara lene kii vajah se desh bhar main kai nagarikon ko dhamkaaya gaya, un par hamale kiye gaye or kam se kam 71 logon kii hatya kii ja chuki he
 Nandi Singh was brutally executed for exposing corruption in the public distribution system through RTI in Assam
 aktubar 2016 main mumbai main bhupendra veeraa ko unke ghar main goli maar di gai, kyonki unhone taqatvar jameen mafia kii mileebhagat kii shikaayat darj karwaane ke liye jaankariyaan hasil kar lee thim
 These attacks are not limited to teaching a lesson to those who use this law
 is kanoon ko bhi bakhsha nahin gaya he
 There have been several attempts by the governments to degrade this law one after the other
 aisi pehali koshish iske lagu hone ke ek saal ke bheetar hi hui thi
 The government wanted the comments written on file to be excluded from the purview of this law to prevent people from accessing information related to the decision-making process
 saal 2013 main jab chah rashtriya siyaasi partiyon ko artiai kanoon ke tahat saarvajanik sanstha ghoshit kar diya gaya, to durlabh ekta pradarshan karte hue ve ek saath aa gayi or is kanoon ke tahat khud ko javabdehi se chhot dilwane ke liye ve sansad main ek sanshodhan prastaav le ain
 a recent attempt to defy the right to information is a move by the government in which it has secretly lodged a bill to introduce a RTI amendment bill
 usne kanoon banane se pehle vyapak vichaar-vimarsh ke usul ko sire se taak par rakh diya
 Through this proposed amendment, the government wants to dig the roots of the autonomy of the Information Commissioners and clamp down on the power of the people to get information
 artiai kanoon ne tay kiya he ki soochna ayukta paanch saal yaa 65 saal kii umr main sevanivrutt hone tak apane pad par rah sakate hai
 The salaries of the Principal Information Commissioner and the Central Information Commissioners are also on par with the judges of the Supreme Court and fixed from Parliament
 artiai kanoon ne soochna ayuktaon ko yah jo tayshuda kaarykaal or ooncha darja diya he, vah unhen itnaa taqatvar banane ke liye hi diya he taaki ve puri swaittata ke saath apane kaam ko anjaam de saken or oonche se oonche ohade par kabiz shaks ko is kanoon kaa paalan karne kii hidaayat de saken
 The RTI Amendment Bill 2018 seeks to hand over the power of deciding the tenure and salary of Information Commissioners in the country to the Central Government
 isse soochna ayog sarkari mahakamon kii tarah kaam karne lagenge or puri sambhaavna he ki yah ayuktaon ko centre sarkaar kaa aagyaakaari bana degaa, is andeshe main ki unke kaarykaal or tankhwaah par koi pratikul asar na pad jaae
 These proposed amendments come against the backdrop of the BJP government's stubborn inaction in filling the vacant posts in the Central Information Commission (CIC)
 may 2014 se siisi main ek bhi ayukta kii niyukti nahin hui he or logon ko adaalaton kaa darwaja khatkhatane ke liye chhod diya gaya he
 Of the total 11 sanctioned posts of commissioner, four are vacant
 pradhan soochna ayukta sahit chaar or pad isi saal khaali ho jaaenge
 Lack of appointments has led to a spate of appeals and complaints, as a result, the functioning of the Commission is being greatly delayed
 isse yah kanoon logon ke liye bemaani banakar rah gaya he
 It is a proof of the power and relevance of the RTI Act that people have consistently defended it with efforts to weaken it
 is kanoon main pherbadal ke har kadam ko janata ke jabardast pratirodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa he—tamaam kshetron ke log artiai ko bachaane ke liye aage aae hai
 This time too, people's opposition to the RTI Amendment Bill forced the government to at least delay the date of its introduction in Parliament
 bhrashtachar se ladgaye or acha rajkaaj dene ko lekar gambhir kisi bhi sarkaar ko artiai vyavastha ko majboot karnaa hi chahie
 The RTI Act provides a decentralized framework for exposing people to corruption and abuse of power
 iske alaava aage kii kadikhaan taiyaar karne kii jarurat he—ek asardaar bhrashtachar-rodhi or shikaayat nivaaran dhaancha banaaya janaa chahie, taaki artiai kanoon ke istemaal ke jariye hasil tajurbe ko jimmedaar logon ke khilaaf bhaypratirohak karrwai main badla ja sake
 Ironically, important parts of this structure — the Lokpal Act and the Whistleblower Security Act — are still awaiting implementation four years after passage
 seva ke pratipaadan kii shikayaton kii jaanch-padtaal ke liye samaybaddh tantra sthapit karne ke makasad se laayaa gaya shikaayat nivaaran vidheyak pichhali loksabhaa ke bhang hone ke saath hi khatm ho gaya or use phir se laane kii koi koshish abhi tak nahin hui he
 The statistics and telling evidence suggest that the RTI Act, considered the most progressive legislation to get information in the world, has successfully started the process of bringing transparency and accountability in government work
 par javabdehi kaa asardaar dhaancha jab sanchalit hoga, keval tabhi ham, bharat ke log, apane paardarshita kanoon ke vyavasthit or sthaayee phaayde hasil kar paaenge

 palaayan bhi hota he lekin jaivik kheti ne hamaari zindagi main badlaav kiya he
 Now we are able to save some money at the end of the month
 hamaari zarurat ye he ki jaivik utpaadon kii maang bade
 The farmer is making a lot of money but if the demand increases, the profits will increase and the cost will decrease further
 ' Getting farmers out of the cycle of debt and cultivating profits was not so easy, and some entrepreneurs have joined the fight in the war of poverty, who are broadening this change, where their crop between the crop and the customer links Are added

 His initiative, called Sustainable Organic, is paying off
 vah aaj pashchimi uttar pradesh, uttarakhand or bundelkhand ke darjanon kisaan pariwaron ke saath jud chuki he
 Awasthi says that she needed to encourage the farmers and for this the first thing they need was the right price for the crop they are growing
 “ham kaaphi pehle se shahari garibon ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 We have seen that many people have come to the cities but want to go back to the village
 ye log kisaan pariwaron se hai
 We encouraged farmers to go to these areas to do organic farming and started buying their produce at the retail price of that area
 hamane kisaanon se kaha ki aap mehnat karte ho to aam daam tay karo
 This created enthusiasm among the farmers
 ” The price of organic fruits and vegetables purchased in this way is 30 to 40 percent more than the normal products coming to the market

 But small entrepreneurs know that they are competing with big companies who do not have money and advertisements to sell chemical farming products

 Nivedita says that she is trying to connect the network of farmers, entrepreneurs and buyers

 We call this period the conversion period and the certification is also called under conversion and with this information the product is sold
 is vakt kisaan ko bade sahare kii zarurat hoti he taaki uskaa utpaada bazaar main bike or uske ghate ko puraa karne main koi uski madad kare

 These stories about organic farming are just a glimpse of change and hope
 kisaan aaj bhi pareshaan hai or samruddhi kii raah par use lambaa rasta tay karnaa he lekin asli badlaav aapse yani graahakon se hi paidaa hoga
 Until the demand for organic products increases

 We have shown you many stories about poisonous food reaching your plate
 chaahe dilli ke hindon ilaake main zahreele pani main ugi subjiyan ho yaa phir acid se chamkaaya gaya adarak
 In the 1960s and 70s, after the Green Revolution, the indiscriminate use of chemicals started, which led to the poisoning taking place in people's bodies
 punjab ke malwa main bimaaron kii sankhya aisi badi ki bathinda se bikaner ko jane vaali railgadee ko log cancer train kehane lage
 Today, different types of chemicals are present in our food to carry different diseases
 jaise chloropiariphos, bacchon ke maansik vikaas main baadha daalata he
 Headache, dizziness and muscle spasms are common illnesses
 doctoron ne to maa ke doodh main bhi is rasayan ke ansh paye hai
 Indosulfan is now banned, leading to the death of many people
 hepta chlor, aapke nervas system or liver par asar daalata he
 Aldrin and DDT are the cause of diseases such as cancer and impotence
 bimariyon kii yah list lambi he lekin samaaj kaa ek bada hissaa jaagruk ho gaya he
 The answer is traditional organic farming, in which chemicals are not used and poison does not reach your body
 jahaan kheti kisaan ke liye ghate kaa sauda rahi he vahaan jaivik kheti main to kisaan ke liye kuch alag mushkilen hai kyonki bazaar zahreele kitnashkon se pata hua he or badi badi companiyon ke hit rasinic kitnashkon ko bechney or chemical forming ko badhaava dene main he
 In such a situation, organic products become expensive
 unhen bazaar tak pahunchaana aasaan nahin
 It is difficult to keep pace with demand and production
 kisaanon ko samay par bhugtan nahin miltaa or sabase badi baat utpaada kii vishwasaneeyata
 But in Loharra village of Bulandshahr, just 60 km from Delhi, 65-year-old Naresh Sirohi and his son Dharmendra have overcome all these difficulties
 naresh sirohi ne fouj se ritair hone ke baad jaivik kheti kaa rasta chunaa or unke bete dharmendra ne apni jami jamaai naukari chhod di
 Today, everything from manure to pesticides in their fields - everything is organic, ie not poisoned
 kareeb paanch acre zamin par sirohi parivaar ne pichley chaar saal se subjiyon or anaj ko ugane kaa silsilaa shuru kiya he
 The Sirohi family makes compost and nutrients from materials such as cow dung, cow urine, dry leaves, jaggery, banana and papaya
 inamen se tamaam chizein unke kheton or ghar main mil jaati hai isaliye kheti kaa kharch bahut kam ho gaya he
 'our costs have come down greatly and the things we produce are well received
 sabase badi baat ye he ki hamaare kheton kii mitti rasayan istemaal na karne se kaaphi acchhee ho gai he
 Now we are neither eating poison ourselves nor feeding others
 ' dharmendra ke pita naresh sirohi kehete hai
 Dharmendra Sirohi of Bulandshahr makes manure from cow dung and cow urine and has reduced the cost
 bulandshahr se kareeb 500 kilometre dur bundelkhand ke gaanvon main kisaanon kii zindagi main hi aisa hi badlaav aa rahaa he
 Near Lalitpur on the border of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, Bhagwan Das and many of his companions are earning between 20 and 25 thousand rupees a month
 jaivik kheti se jude is kisaan network kii ek kadi hai jagabhaan kushvaha jo apni passbook dikhaate hai
 The bank entries show that they are constantly getting money
 'pichley maheene ke bheetar yahaan kisaan samooh ne har maheene ausatan sava lakh rupee ke fal or sabziyaan bechnaa shuru kar deen
 The farmers are happy that their cost is continuously decreasing and the goods are being sold at home
 ' kamyaabi kaa ye graph dhire dhire bad rahaa he
 This is a refreshing hope in Bundelkhand, which shows a depressed picture of farmers due to debt, migration and suicide
 ek aisi kranti kii shuruyaat jisamen jagabaan or kamalesh kareeb 15 acre zamin par kai kisaan pariwaron ke saath organic forming kar rahe hai
 Jagabhan's brother Kamlesh Kushwaha seems excited
 'haa bahut bade ilaake main yahaan kisaan ab bhi pareshaan he
 There is also migration but organic farming has changed our lives
 ab ham maheene ke ant main kuch paisa bachaa paa rahe hai
 Our need is to increase the demand for organic products
 kisaan bahut kuch paisa kar rahaa he lekin maang bade to munafa badhegaa or laagat or ghategi
 ' kisaanon ko karz ke chakravyuuh se baahar nikaalnaa or munaafe kii kheti karana itnaa aasaan nahin tha or garibi kii jang se ladane main kuch udhyamiyon ne saath diya he jo is badlaav ko vyapak bana rahe hai jahaan kheton main ugi unki fasal or graahak ke bich kii kadiyaan judati hai
 Jyoti Awasthi, who markets organic products along Delhi's Ghaziabad and Malcha Marg, has come a long way in the last nearly two years
 satat argenic naam se unki pahal rang laa rahi he
 She has today joined dozens of peasant families in western Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Bundelkhand
 avasthi kahati hai ki vah kisaanon ko utsahit karne kii zarurat thi or iske liye pehali chiz unhen us fasal ke sahi daam chaiye jo vah uga rahe hai
 “we have been working with the urban poor for a long time
 hamane ye dekha ki bahut saare log shaharon main aa to gayi hai lekin waapas gaanv janaa chaahate hai
 These people are from peasant families
 hamane in ilaakon main jaakar kisaanon ko jaivik kheti karne ko protsaahit kiya or unke utpaada us ilaake ke retail bhav main kharidne shuru kiye
 We told the farmers that if you work hard then fix the common price
 isse kisaanon main utsaah paidaa hua
 " is tarah se kharide gayi jaivik fal or sabziyon kii keemat bazaar aate aate saamaanya utpaadon ke mukaable 30 se 40 pratishat adhik hoti he
 This is the challenge for entrepreneurs like Jyoti
 “shuruyaat main hamane ghaataa khaakar ye kaam shuru kiya lekin hamen ummid he ki kisaanon or graahakon main jaagrukta badhegi to ye sabake liye vin-vin vaali sichuation hogi
 ”says Jyoti Awasthi, director of Sustain
 aise udhyamiyon kii ab ek kadi ban rahi he
 Take, for example, 38-year-old Ganesh Chaudhary, whose business of organic products is expanding from Katni in Madhya Pradesh to Hyderabad in the south
 peshey se ejeeniyar rahe choudhary ‘aarogy sukh’ ke sansthaapak or saajhedaar hai or beeing desi ke naam se kai jaivik utpaada banaate hai
 Desi cow is among their products
 vah kehete hai ki in dinon gaay ke naam par utpaat machaa rahe logon ko gaay kii asal ahmiyat pataa nahin he ki vah kitne phaayde de sakati he
 Chaudhary has also brought together several farmer families
 vah kehete hai, “pehle main sochataa tha ki main akelaa ye kaam kar saktaa hum lekin kaam faisla gaya or ab khushi he ki kai pariwaron ko main apane saath jod rahaa hum
 Many of my hands seem to have moved
 ” These stories are important because they are coming from the areas where there is often disappointing news on the situation of the farmers
 kahin-kahin hi sahi ummid kii kiran dikh rahi he
 Meet 25-year-old Bhavesh Wankhede Patil
 mumbai ke tata insttitute of soshal science (TISS) se padhai karne ke baad aaj wo vidarbha ke maayoos kisaanon main josh bhar rahe hai
 Bhavesh tells us that among all the families where farmers committed suicide, many of them want to join their campaign of organic farming
 bhavesh kehete hai jab unke pita ko dil kaa daura padaa to unhen rasinic kheti ke kuprabhavon ko samajhane kaa mauka mila
 He came to know that on the one hand poison is reaching the customers' body, while the farmer is cultivating losses and getting stuck in debt
 “hamane donon ore kii samasyaon ko ek saath rakhkar dekha or tay kiya ki kisaanon ko sasteneble agriculture kii ore le janaa hoga
 We teach the farmer how he can reduce the cost of his farming
 ham unhen sikhaate hai ki gaay kaa gobar, gomutra or pattiyaan or west kaa istemaal kar khaad kaise banaai jaati he
 ”bhavesh set up a network to provide technical advice to farmers along with things
 vah daawa karte hai ki aaj ek hazaar se adhik kisaan unke saath jude hai
 Organic farming is reducing costs for Vidarbha farmers, burdened with debt
 aaj jab desh main kuch log gauraksha ke naam par utpaat machaa rahe hon or dharmik jajbaton ko bhadakaane kaa silsilaa chal rahaa he to ye kisaan or udhyami gaay kii aarthik upyogita or guseva kaa nayaa rasta dikhaa rahe hai
 Dharmendra Sirohi and his father make manure and nutrients at home from cow dung and cow urine which is sufficient for their cultivation and in Bundelkhand, Kamlesh and his colleagues have also reduced the cost of farming by using organic manure and now they are zero Budgets are moving towards farming
 2015 main sarkaar kii apni report ke hisaab se jaivik utpaadon kaa bazaar 25 se 30 pratishat salanaa kii dar se bad rahaa he or ek anumaan ke mutabik agle kuch saalon main 9000 karod rupee kaa hoga
 In the organic products business, it is a tough challenge to build the credibility of your product in the market with small entrepreneurs and farmers
 jahaan satat kii avasthi kahati hai ki wo prayogshaalaon se certificate hasil kar apane cells centaron main graahakon kii santushti ke liye rakhti hai
 At the same time, Ganesh says that certification is necessary but the real seal is the satisfaction of the customer
 “agar graahak ko phayda hoga to vah zarur hamaare utpaada kharidega
 "says Ganesh
 lekin chote udhyamiyon ko pataa he ki unka muqabla badi badi companiyon se he jinke paas rasinic kheti ke utpaada bechney ke liye paise or vigyapanon kii kami nahin he
 In such a situation, people like Nivedita Varshney have a special role to add these links
 nivedita kahati hai ki vah kisaanon, udhyamiyon or kharidaaron ke network ko jodne kii koshish kar rahi he
 The comments vah bataati hai, “jab kisaan chemical forming se organic farming kii ore aata he to mitti se zahreele chemicals ko hatane main kai saal lagate hai
 Usually it is three years
 ham is period ko kanvarjan period kehete hai or certification bhi under kanvarjan ke naam se hota he or isi jaankaree ke saath utpaada bechaa jaataa he
 At this time, the farmer needs a big support so that his produce is sold in the market and someone will help him to meet his deficit
 aise main kai udhyami, sarkari or gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kisaan kii madad kar rahe hai
 This is quite important
 VIDEO- jaivik kheti ne badal di kisaanon kii kismat If you look closely, you will know that the relation of air going into your lungs is also related to what you are eating because the use of chemicals and chemical fertilizers also dissolve a lot of poison in the air
 jaivik kheti ko lekar hamane ye kahaniyaan badlaav or ummid kii ek jhalak bhar hai
 Farmers are still worried and they have to go a long way on the road to prosperity, but the real change will come from you only
 jab tak jaivik utpaadon kii maang nahin badhati
 The farmer will be troubled and the fields will be poisonous
 'ham jo chizein bazaar se lekar khate hai unamem rasayan hote hai

 These stories about organic farming are just a glimpse of change and hope
 kisaan aaj bhi pareshaan hai or samruddhi kii raah par use lambaa rasta tay karnaa he lekin asli badlaav aapse yani graahakon se hi paidaa hoga
 Until the demand for organic products increases
 kisaan pareshaan rahegaa or khet zahreele rahenge
 The answer is traditional organic farming, in which chemicals are not used and poison does not reach your body
 jahaan kheti kisaan ke liye ghate kaa sauda rahi he vahaan jaivik kheti main to kisaan ke liye kuch alag mushkilen hai kyonki bazaar zahreele kitnashkon se pata hua he or badi badi companiyon ke hit rasinic kitnashkon ko bechney or chemical forming ko badhaava dene main he
 In such a situation, organic products become expensive

 But in Loharra village of Bulandshahr, just 60 km from Delhi, 65-year-old Naresh Sirohi and his son Dharmendra have overcome all these difficulties
 naresh sirohi ne fouj se ritair hone ke baad jaivik kheti kaa rasta chunaa or unke bete dharmendra ne apni jami jamaai naukari chhod di
 Today, everything from manure to pesticides in their fields - everything is organic, ie not poisoned
 kareeb paanch acre zamin par sirohi parivaar ne pichley chaar saal se subjiyon or anaj ko ugane kaa silsilaa shuru kiya he
 The Sirohi family makes compost and nutrients from materials such as cow dung, cow urine, dry leaves, jaggery, banana and papaya
 inamen se tamaam chizein unke kheton or ghar main mil jaati hai isaliye kheti kaa kharch bahut kam ho gaya he
 'our costs have come down greatly and the things we produce are well received
 sabase badi baat ye he ki hamaare kheton kii mitti rasayan istemaal na karne se kaaphi acchhee ho gai he
 Now we are neither eating poison ourselves nor feeding others
 ' dharmendra ke pita naresh sirohi kehete hai
 Dharmendra Sirohi of Bulandshahr makes manure from cow dung and cow urine and has reduced the cost
 bulandshahr se kareeb 500 kilometre dur bundelkhand ke gaanvon main kisaanon kii zindagi main hi aisa hi badlaav aa rahaa he

 There is also migration but organic farming has changed our lives
 ab ham maheene ke ant main kuch paisa bachaa paa rahe hai
 Our need is to increase the demand for organic products

 “we have been working with the urban poor for a long time
 hamane ye dekha ki bahut saare log shaharon main aa to gayi hai lekin waapas gaanv janaa chaahate hai
 These people are from peasant families

 bhavesh kehete hai jab unke pita ko dil kaa daura padaa to unhen rasinic kheti ke kuprabhavon ko samajhane kaa mauka mila
 He came to know that on the one hand poison is reaching the customers' body, while the farmer is cultivating losses and getting stuck in debt
 “hamane donon ore kii samasyaon ko ek saath rakhkar dekha or tay kiya ki kisaanon ko sasteneble agriculture kii ore le janaa hoga
 We teach the farmer how he can reduce the cost of his farming

 We have seen that many people have come to the cities but want to go back to the village
 ye log kisaan pariwaron se hai
 We encouraged farmers to go to these areas to do organic farming and started buying their produce at the retail price of that area
 hamane kisaanon se kaha ki aap mehnat karte ho to aam daam tay karo
 This created enthusiasm among the farmers

 "" After Swayamvar, Rakhi Sawant is once surrounded by allegations
 ek film ke nirmaataa-nirdeshak ne raakhi saavant par vishwasghaat karke rakam hadapney kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Rakhi is accused that Rakhi first took an advancement to work on her film and when the date came closer, she was shocked
 nirmaataa kaa phone bhi nahin uthatimbollywood kii awwal darje kii item girl raakhi saavant ko aaropon ke katghare main khadaa kiya he ek film ke nirmaataa-nirdeshak ne
 The name of that film is Luv Khichdi
 film lav khichdi main raakhi saavant ko ek naukaraani kaa kirdaar karnaa tha
 Film director a Srinivas has been accusing that he had also given Rakhi Sawant earnest money for the film, but when the shooting date came, he went missing
 or to or film ke nirmaataa-nirdeshak kaa yahaan tak aarope he ki jab unhone raakhi ko phone lagaaya to raakhi ne phone bhi nahin uthaaya
 Rakhi denies the allegations
 The producer-director says that Rakhi signed this role for 5 lakh rupees
 film ke darector kaa kahana he ki pehle wo naukaraani ke role ke liye sonaali kulkarni ko le rahe the, lekin raakhi ne kaha ki wo ye role kaaphi achche se kar sakati he, to unhone lav khichdi main raakhi ko naukaraani kaa role de diya
 Although Rakhi says that the producer-director's allegations of Love Khichdi are baseless, they don't even know them
 hairat main daalane vaali baat ye he ki raakhi lav khichdi ke nirmaataa-nirdeshak ke saath pehle bhi film paisa vasuul main item number kar chuki hai
 Also, Rakhi has already told about Love Khichdi in Karan Johar's show Koffee with Karan
 ab pachhataa rahe hai nirmaatafilm lav khichdi is shuukravaar ko release ho rahi he, lekin sawaal ye uthta he ki raakhi ne ye sab kyon kiya
 Has Rakhi reached the position of publicity that she did not find the role of a maid suitable for her career
 diarector us din ko kos rahe hai jab unhone raakhi kii apni film 'lav khichdi' main naukaraani kaa role ofer kiya tha
 The director is sad that Rakhi Sawant has also previously worked in her film Paisa Vasool, but now Rakhi has refused to recognize her
 raakhi ke is ruukhe vyavhaar se unit khafa he or chaahati he item girl ko sabak sikhaanaa
 Rakhi's role as a maid was later done by Sonali Kulkarni
 thaga mahasoos kar rahe swayamvar ke dulherakhi ke swayamvar main aaye lagbhag sabhi 16 duulhe ab khud ko thaga sa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The Rakhi that he had come to make as his own has now started to be considered fraudulent
 tivi par swayamvar rachakar itihaas rachane vaali raakhi par sho ke dauraan hi iljaamon kii bauchhaar ho gai
 Rakhi started her swayamvar with great fanfare
 raakhi se shaadi kaa sapana sanjokar aaye 16 naujavaanon ne raakhi kaa dil jeetne ke liye lakh jatan kiye, lekin jab ek-ek karke raakhi ne duulhon ko riject karnaa shuru kiya to swayamvar kaa sach bhi duulhon ke saath baahar aane laga
 Now Rakhi started to appear, there were many such grooms in the swayamvara of the fraud, who started liking Rakhi
 raakhi ne unke pyaar ko aajamaaya, unase milakar ghanto baaten kii or jab lagane laga ki shaayad raakhi ko apana humsafar mil gaya bas tabhi raakhi usamen koi naa kai buraai dhund use sho se baahar kar detii
 Something similar happened with Manmohan Tiwari of Rishikesh
 raakhi ko apni baton or adaaon se rijhaa chuke manmohan ko lagane laga tha ki raakhi kii aakhri pasand vahi hai
 Rakhi also went to his home in Rishikesh, but when it came time to pronounce the decision, Rakhi started seeing Manmohan cheaters
 unhone manmohan ko swayamvar se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Rakhi even said that her heart was broken and even threatened to go out of the swayamvara
 abhi sirf sagaai kii, shaadi nahin" "lekin lagata he raakhi kaa dil kaaphi majboot tha wo phir laut ai
 Once again to give the remaining grooms a chance
 shaayad raakhi ke isi andaaj ko dekhakar sho main aae duulhon ko ye mahasoos hone laga tha ki raakhi unhen dhokhaa de rahi hai
 Now according to the rules of the swayamvara, Rakhi had to choose one of her brides, so bypassing Delhi's psyche and horizon to reach the final, Rakhi chose Pardesi Babu Ilesh as her groom but did not marry her
 sagaai kar shaadi ko taalane vaali raakhi ke is faisle ne ek baar phir ye sochane par majaboor kar diya ki kahin raakhi kaa swayamvar sirf publicity kaa tamaasha to nahin tha
 If this is so, then the groom who came in the swayamvara would consider himself a victim of fraud
 nek nahin najar aate iraderakhi ne sari duniya ke saamne ilesh ke gale main varmala daalkar apane duulhe ko chun liya, lekin desh ke sabase bade swayamvar kaa sabase bada suspence ab bhi barkaraar he
 Rakhi, who has chosen her bridegroom, will Rakhi decorate her name with sindoor as well
 raakhi kii maane to unhone ilesh se shaadi karne kaa faisla kar liya he
 Now the question is that if Rakhi has already decided to get married, then why not get married instead of engagement in Swayamvar
 swayamvar ke faisle ke vakt raakhi ke haav bhav or unki baton se raakhi ke iraade nek nazar nahin aate
