 In Mumbai, 22 people died due to a stampede on the footover bridge between Parel and Elphinstone railway station on Friday
 ab is haadase par bada khulaasa hua he
 On behalf of the Shiv Sena, two mps Arvind Sawant and Rahul Shiwale wrote a letter to widen the same bridge in 2015-16, in response to which the then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said that the Railways did not have funds for it
 unhone kaha tha ki global market main mandi he, aapaki shikaayat to sahi he lekin abhi fund kii kami he
 However, the government says that the mps were accepted immediately
 sarkaar kii safai- nae brij banane kii mil chuki he manjuricendre sarkaar ne is par safai dete hue kaha ki nae footover brij ke liye nirmaan ke liye saal 2015 main hi manjuuri de di gai thi or iske liye tender kii prakriya abhi chal rahi he
 The then railway minister Suresh Prabhu has approved the construction of the footover bridge
 suresh prabhu ne brij ke nirmaan ke liye 11
 86 crores has been sanctioned
 nayaa pul 12 meter chaudaa hoga
 After a letter from mps, Suresh Prabhu called a meeting for this in 2015 and it was included in the Railway Budget for 2016-17
 shivasena saansad arvind saavant ne iske liye saal 2014 main endie sarkaar ke pehle railmantri sadanand gauda ko bhi patr likhaa tha
 But the then minister also paid no attention to it
 shivasena saansad rahul shivale ne 23 april 2015 ko suresh prabhu ko patr likhakar foot overbrij ko chaudaa karne kii maang kii thi
 Apart from this, other Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant also reiterated the demand by writing a letter to Prabhu in February 2016
 us dauraan suresh prabhu ne fund kii kami or vaishvik mandi kaa hawala dekar kaha tha ki aapaki maang jaij he lekin abhi fund nahin he isliye madad nahin kii ja sakati he
 MP Rahul Shiwale, who wrote the letter, told Aaj Tak that he had raised the issue from the then Railway Minister to Parliament
 lekin kisi ne bhi is masale par gambhirtha nahin dikhaai thi
 Today's accident is a result of the negligence of the railways
 bataa den ki shuukravaar subah kareeb 10
 At 30 pm, 22 people have died due to stampede on the footover bridge of Parel and Elphinstone railway station in Mumbai
 is ghatana main 35 se zyada log ghayal hue hai
 It is being told that the over bridge was slippery due to rain, accident occurred due to breaking of part of the railing
 haadase kii jaanch ke aadesh die ja chuke hai
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal went to the KEM Hospital to know the health of the injured
 maharashtra sarkaar kii ore se mritkon ke parijanon ko 5-5 lakh kaa muaavja dene kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 Since the death of lashkar-e-taiba commander Burhan Wani, the deteriorating situation in Jammu and Kashmir is still not taking its name
 suraksha balon par lagaataar ho rahe hamalon or pakistan kii ore se kiye ja rahe sijafire ulanghan ne bhartiya suraksha agenciyon kii chintaa badha di he
 Lieutenant Omar Fayaz and then the beating of the DSP Mohammed Ayub Pandit by the mob in the mosque has caused widespread anger across the country
 dspi kii hatya ke peeche algaavvaadiyon kaa haath hone kii baat bhi saamne aa rahi he
 In such a situation, the question now arises that how will peace be restored in the valley? What strategy should the government and security forces adopt? If the experts who keep a constant watch on the valley are believed, then the situation in Jammu and Kashmir can be improved by taking some special steps
 
 
 
 1
 algaavvaadiyon par lage banghati main maahaul bigaadane ke liye sabase jyadaiylgaavvaadi netaa hi jimmedaarhain
 From the bandh to protests in the province, only the separatist leaders call
 iske alaava patharbaajon ko uksaane ke peeche bhi inhen kaa haath hota he
 The talk of separatists being involved in attacks on security forces and terrorist incidents has also come to light
 inako pakistan kii ore se funding bhi di jaati he
 Despite all this, the government adores them
 kai algaavvaadi netaaon ko sarkaar ne suraksha bhi muhaiyaa kara rakhaa he
 If these are banned completely, it can help to control the situation to some extent
 iske alaavaalgaavvaadiyonki suraksha khatm kii jaani chahie
 On Saturday, Union Minister Mukhtar said that there is no difference between terrorists and separatists
 2
 By making a boundary on the Pakistan border, Kopakistan knows very well that it cannot win by directly competing with India
 lihaaja vah bharat ke khilaaf aatankwaad kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 Pakistan is infiltrated by terrorists who carry out violence in the valley
 sarkaar or suraksha bal bhi yah maanate hai ki seemaa paar se aatankiyon kii ghuspaith badi samasya he
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh has also said to make a boundary on the border with Pakistan
 yadi yah boundry ban jaati he, to aatankiyon kii ghuspaith ruk jaaegi
 At the same time, terrorist funding and smuggling from across the border will also be curbed
 3
 Special cyber cellpakistan, terrorists and separatists use vigorous social media to spread violence in the valley to monitor social media
 suraksha balon kii tamaam sakhti or karfu ke baavjood bhi pradarshnkaree jamaa ho jate hai
 Now the question arises that how do these protesters gather so soon? Intelligence agencies believe that terrorists and separatists use whatsapp groups, Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to incite people to protest against security forces
 khaskar jab aatanki suraksha balon se ghir jate hai, to sthaneey logon ko aad banaate hai
 Due to the stone pelting, the security forces are hampered in the operations against the terrorists
 agar sibar cell banaakar soshal media par kadi nigaah rakhi jaae or fouran karrwai kii jaae, to is par kaaphi had tak lagaam lagaaya ja saktaa he
 4
 kashmiri panditon ko ghati main basaaya jaeghati main kashmiri hinduon ke palaayan ke baad se aatankiyon or algaavvaadiyon kaa prabhaav badha he
 In such a situation, if the Kashmiri Hindus are resettled in the valley, then the terrorists and separatists will be defeated
 iske liye sarkaar ko kadi mashkkat jarur kerani padegi
 Kashmiri Hindus will also have to provide special protection, but this will have far-reaching consequences and the situation in the valley will soon improve
 maaloom ho ki jammu evam kashmir main kashmiri hinduon par atyaachaar kiya gaya tha or unako palaayan ke liye majaboor hona padaa tha
 5
 janaaje main pahunchane khoonkhaar aatankiyon par drone se najarajammu evam kashmir main suraksha balon ke saath muthbhed main maare jane vaale aatankiyon ke janaaje main hathiyaar lahraane kii ghatnaon main lagaataar ijapha ho rahaa he
 The terrorists, after killing their partner, arrive with weapons in his funeral and incite the youth against India in the name of Jihad
 haalanki us vakt suraksha balon ke liye karrwai karnaa mushkil hota he, kyonki aatanki bheed kii aad lekar kisi bhi badi vaardaat ko anjaam de sakate hai
 In such a situation, the terrorists who are gathering in the drones can be easily identified and their movements can be monitored
 iske baad unke khilaaf aasaani se karrwai kii ja sakati he
 6
 aatankiyon ke khilaaf vishesh sainya oparationsuraksha balon kii ore se aatankiyon ke khilaaf samay-samay par oparation chalaae jate hai or aatankiyon ko dher kiya jaataa he
 There is a fear among terrorists as well
 haalanki iske baavjood bhi aatanki apni harkaton se baj nahin aa rahe hai
 Due to the vigilance of security agencies, Pakistan and terrorist organizations are constantly changing their strategies
 aise main kai baar suraksha balon ko aatankiyon ke khilaaf abhiyaan main safalataa nahin milti he or ve graminon ko aage karke bhaag nikalate hai
 In such a situation, the security forces should conduct special operations against the terrorists
 iske alaava suraksha balon kii nai batalian banaai jaani chahie, jo aatankiyon par karrwai karne ke saath hi graminon se behtareen talmail bana sake
 The terrorists will not get any relief from the villagers
 7
 Connect with the stream of employment and development: Employment and development in Jammu and Kashmir also remain a big problem
 rojgaar nahin milane par kashmiri yuva algaavvaadiyon ke saamne ghutane tech dete hai
 After this, the separatists and Pakistani terrorists give them money to provoke them to stonewall and attack the security forces
 berogari kii maar jhel rahe ye yuva majaboor hokar is raah par nikal padate hai
 Apart from this, there is also a lot of development in the valley
 iskaa aatanki or algaavvaadi jamkar phayda uthaate hai or apane mansoobon ko anjaam dete hai
 If the area is connected to the development stream, it can help to prevent violent incidents
 iske alaava gumraah yuvaaon ko sahi raah main laane main dharm guru bhi ahm bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai

 ) On Thursday, Katra shopkeepers, horsemen, sedanists, Pithas etc
 protested against the construction of a new motor track for the Vaishno Devi temple
 banganga ke paas pradarshnakariyon par kaabo paane ke liye police ko lathicharge karnaa padaa
 5 people including two policemen were injured in the collision
 police ne sthaneey vyapaar mandal ke teen netaaon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Meanwhile, the Vaishno Devi Yatra continues
 shraddhaluon ko koi asuvidha nahin ho iske liye police kaa baari bandobast kiya gaya he
 Actually, the new track is being constructed by Balaji Chowk checkpost near Katra on behalf of Shri Mata Vaishno Shrine Board
 ye traderdhkunvaritak jayega
 In this way, the entire route from Katra to Vaishno Devi Durbar can be decided by vehicle
 is trek kaa katra ke dukandaar, ghode vaale, piththu jamkar virodh kar rahe hai
 He says that once this track starts, the livelihood of shopkeepers around Banganga and Charanapaduka temple will be lost
 in sabakaa rojgaar shraddhaluon se hi chalata he
 They say that this will make four lakh people unemployed
 udhar, shrimata vaishno devi shrin bordca kahana he ki nae trek kaa istemaal sirf viipi movement, board ke saamaan kii awajahi ke liye hi kiya jayega
 But the shopkeepers of Katra say that once the new Baan ganga-tarakot-ardhkunwari route track has been started, then it will be opened for devotees
 inkaa kahana he ki nayaa maarg khulne se shraddhalu is raste se darshan ko jaaenge to paaramparik maarg par sthit dukandaaron kaa kaam prabhavit hoga
 Apart from this, the employment of horsemen will also be lost as they will not be allowed to go on the new track

 After becoming PM, Modi directly summoned the secretary of every department and gave the mantra to join the work with confidence
 ab upi main yogi raaj he or siem adityanath isi raah par aage badhate dikh rahe hai
 Bhagambhag seen in the Secretariat: On Monday, Bhagambhag was worth seeing in the Lucknow Secretariat
 tamaam vibhaagon ke aalaa adhikariyon ko siem yogi ne talab kiya tha or unhen apane-apane vibhaag ke kaamkaaj kaa blue print pesh karnaa tha
 CM Yogi held a marathon meeting with the officials for 8 hours and during this time all the officers were seen coming towards their respective departments
 siem me tamaam faislon or pariyojnaon se judi filein mangai or ek-ek point par gaur kiya
 Officers' targets were set and personal accountability was fixed
 log ise gavarnence kaa modi style bataa rahe hai
 What happened in the 8-hour meeting? On Monday, the government babus had to struggle a lot for the meeting of CM Yogi
 rajdhani lakhanu main somvaar ko der raat tak siem adityanath yogi or unke cabinet mantriyon ke saath adhikariyon kii baithak chalati rahi, jahaan siem yogi ne sabhi vibhaagon ke sachivon se har cheez kii khabar lene ke saath aage ke road map par charchaa kii
 At the same time, the Yogi government set a target of creating 10 lakh new jobs in 5 years
 sutron kii maane to shiksha vibhaag ke saath baithak main rajya kii maujuuda shiksha vyavastha kaa jayja liya gaya
 Along with this, instructions were also given to reduce the fees of private schools
 basic shiksha vibhaag ke sachiv ajay kumaar ke mutabik, in saare nirdeshon ko agle 100 dinon main amal main laana he
 What is the 100-day roadmap? CM Yogi has asked all departments to make a 100-day roadmap and start implementing it immediately
 in 100 dinon ke baad sabhi adhikariyon se kaam kaa report bhi talab kiya jayega or kotahi paae jane par adhikariyon ko kadi karrwai kii chetavanee bhi de di gai he
 At the same time, the government's next target of these 100 days will be to create and execute a roadmap for 6 months and then 1 year
 yahaan jimmedaari tay karte hue teji se kaam puraa karne kaa yogi kaa makasad saaf jhalkata he
 The 16 days of the Yogi government have come to an end after the BJP came to power with a landslide victory in Kamup instead of the transfer
 ection mod main yogi tabadatod faisle to kar rahe hai lekin in 16 dinon main aam prachlan ke anusaar adhikariyon ke tabadalon ko lekar koi jaldbaaji nahin dikhi
 In contrast, Yogi along with the officials posted in the previous government are busy giving their work
 yahaan atakaley lagane lagi hai ki aakhir upi kii beuroperesi ko lekar yogi kaa plan he kya? siem yogi ke 15 dinon ke kaam ke tareeke par gaur karne par mukhya rup se 5 baaten saamne aati hai jinhen yogi masterstroke kii tarah istemaal kar beuroperesi ko kaam par lagaana chaahate hai
 Apparently, with this new governance system of CM Yogi, there is a double-edged sword position in front of the officials
 1
 Fearing the system by directly connecting with the public, the Yogi government, which came to power with a strong majority, has adopted a new style of working
 khud siem yogi sabhi vibhaagon ke afasaron ke saath sidhaa sampark bana rahe hai
 Actually this is the Modi style of running the government
 parikshaon main nakal kii lagaataar aati shikayaton ke bich siem yogi ne 111 kendron ke pariksha manageron par jahaan sidhi karrwai kii vahiin lakhanu main shikayaton par karrwai ke liye control room bana diya
 a whatsapp number was issued and people were asked to make a direct complaint of copying and it was announced that action would be taken within 3 hours
 sarkaar chalaane ke is tareeke se log khud sarkaar se jud rahe hai or gadabadi karne vaale logon main isi kaa khauf he
 2
 yojanaon main kamiyon ko dur karne par fokaspurane adhikariyon ke tabadale ke bajaay siem yogi ne unheen ke haath main vibhaagon kii bagdor saunp kar kaam kaa nayaa tarika apanaaya he
 Recently, CM Yogi went there for a review of the Gomti Riverfront Project and went there and called for a response from the officials
 pariyojna main hua gadabadiyon kii jaanch shuru karai gai or turant kaam karne kaa aadesh jari kiya
 3
 anushaasan ke liye nae niyamsystem ko chust-durust karne ke liye siem yogi khud daure kar rahe hai to adhikariyon ko bhi janata ke bich jaakar kaam karne kaa farmaan jari kiya gaya he
 The next day after assuming power, CM Yogi reached Hazratganj police station and took stock of the deployment and cleanliness of the officers there
 iske baad yogi ne aspataal kaa bhi daura kiya
 The CM put a clear prohibition on eating gutkha-tobacco in offices and issued a decree that the government offices should hear complaints or people coming to work and the officers and employees should act on the complaints of the people in addition to behaving properly
 4
 While trying to send officers among the public, CM Yogi is constantly visiting various offices and projects, while officials have also been asked to work among the public
 siem yogi ne adhikariyon ko roj ek ghanta paidal chalakar janata ke bich maujuudagi kaa ahsaas karnaa kaa farmaan sunaaya to helplinon ke jariye shikaayatein sidhe khud tak pahunchane kaa bhi intjaam kiya
 This has increased the pressure on the officers to work
 5
 As soon as corruption was handled through transparency, CM Yogi announced that the officer should make his property public in 15 days
 iske alaava adhikariyon ke saath lagaataar meeting kar yogi ne sandesh diya ki har vibhaag par unki najar he
 Yogi also sent a message to all his ministers that only officers with clean image and honest background should be kept in the ministry with them
 unhone sansad ke baahar samvaadadaataaon se baat karte hue kaha, 'log salmaan ko bahut chaahate hai
 So if he is a brand ambassador then what is the problem with this? ' abhinayta ke hit and ran maamle main kathith rup se shaamil hone ke babat puche jane par hema ne kaha ki vah 'unke jivan kaa ek hissaa tha
 
 unki lokapriyata kaa istemaal ek achche kaam ke liye kiya janaa chahie

 And a big vote bank devotees of Baba
 jis sunariya jail main baba band he, us jail ke jailer ne to baqayada baba ko achche chaal-chalan kaa certificate bhi de diya he
 By the way, the most amazing thing is the reason for which Baba wants to come out of jail
 baba kaa kahana he ki wo kheti karnaa chaahate hai
 This is the reason that parole has been applied on behalf of Baba
 parole
 In simple words, it means the conditional release of a prisoner for a specific period of time
 thik vaise hi jaise mukadmaa chalane ke dauraan aaropee zamaanat kaa hakdaar hota he
 Similarly, the punishment of the sentenced prisoner parole after the punishment is announced
 lekin kisi bhi kaidi ko yun hi parole nahin mil sakati
 There must be some special reasons for this

 lihaaza baahar aane ke liye rohtak kii sunariya jail ke kaidi number 1997 perol jaise tareeke apana rahaa he

 Pawar said, 'bjp-shiv Sena has been an ally for 25 years

 haalanki, shivasena lagaataar yah daawey kar rahi he ki wo ensipi ke sampark main he
 But Pawar says he has no role in government formation nor has he spoken to anyone
 sharad pavaar ne bhale hi bijepi-shivasena ko sarkaar banane ke liye kaha ho, lekin congress vidhayakon kaa man he ki bijepi satta se out rahe or shivasena ko samarthan dekar ensipi sarkaar banawaye or congress baahar se sahyog kare

 isiilie patrkaar big brother istemaal kar rahe hai, badi bahan nahin
 Perhaps our elder sisters do not have such a negative reputation
 kya bijepi shivasena ke saath big brother kaa game khel rahi he? kya shivasena bada bhai bananaa chaahati he? ye kahani do-chaar siton kii he yaa usase bhi kuch zyada
 Is the Shiv Sena conscious of the expansionist policy of the BJP or is the BJP desperate to change the slogan of Congress Mukt Bharat into a bjp-rich India
 bijepi kaa strike rate hameshaa behatar rahaa he
 Is there a danger of Shiv Sena not getting a chair if the BJP gets more seats
 shivasena saaf-saaf kah chuki he ki maharashtra main use satta chahie
 BJP has not said anything on this
 uddhav thakare kaaryakartaaon ke bich bijepi kaa mazaaq udaate hai ki seat maangane aae hai yaa dene aae hai
 Narendra Modi was saved by Balasaheb Thackeray in 2002
 aap dilli main raaj kiijie ham maharashtra main karenge
 Is Shiv Sena feeling insecure? Does he not trust the BJP? Is it not because of this, because NDA is not
 naam ke liye he magar vaajapeyi ke samay jo dhaancha bana tha, jiskaa chairman chote sahyogi dalon se bhi ho saktaa tha, vaisaa endie nahin he
 Shiv Sena BJP dispute is not being resolved on any common forum
 pune main amit shah kii sabha main naaraa lag gaya ki chhatrapati shivaji kaa he aashirwad, chale chalo modi ke saath
 The BJP leader's statement in the Times of India said that he would have a picture of Shivaji on the dais
 jai shivaji-jai bhavani kaa naaraa bijepi ke kaaryakarta bhi lagaayenge
 So is BJP also provoking the army? da hindu main priyanka kakodakar ne likhaa he ki is baar jab amit shah mumbai gaye or matoshri nahin gaye to shivasena ke kaaryakarta puraani tasviir baantne lage ki kaise modi ne bala sahab thakare ke saamne sar jhukaaya tha
 After the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP did not give special importance to the Shiv Sena in the Union Cabinet
 shapath grahan tak shivasena ke sambhavit mantri naa-nukur kar rahe the
 The Shiv Sena also twice played the role of Big Brother in front of the BJP by supporting the UPA presidential candidate
 badi bahan kaa nahin
 The Shiv Sena used to advocate Sushma Swaraj a lot before the Lok Sabha elections
 sanjay raut kaa bayaan tha ki bala sahab thakare ne pradhanmantri pad ke liye sushamaa swaraj ko upyukt mana tha or unke ye shabd hamaare liye aakhri hai
 After losing in the Karnataka assembly, Saamana had said that wherever bjp's superstar Modi campaigned, the BJP lost
 kya aise bayanon ke ateet main is khatas ko dekha jaae yaa bijepi kii chahat ko
 If this alliance is broken, will the students of politics see any intense political conflict between the two claimants of Hindutva
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke baad saamana ne likhaa tha ki bhartiya janata party hindutv kaa chola utarkar secularism kii topi sar par na chadaaye
 If you do this then what is the difference between Congress and BJP? If Modi gets votes in Gujarat, then because of staunch Hindutva
 kya yah dilachasp nahin he ki maharashtra kii raajnneeti kii outline bahari rekhaaen phir se khinchi ja rahi hai
 a cartoon from the Times of India is being recalled again

 In it Bal Thackeray is seated on a chair and his legs are on the front chair
 bijepi ke netaa file lekar khadey hai or kursi ke neeche machia rakhi he jisapar baithne ke liye thakare sahab kah rahe hai
 So it is not that the BJP has not suffered
 ho saktaa he ki sab pitrupaksh ke khatm hone kaa intazaar kar rahe hon
 This is also an important aspect of Indian politics
 chunaav ke baad sharad pavaar shivasena ke saath jaaenge yaa bijepi ke saath yah bhi ek alag paksh he
 At present, Congress NCP are seen fighting together despite the lack of support from Congress NCP workers
 sansad main pavaar or unki party congress yaa upie se alag line lene lagi he
 Just as the two Hindutva parties have different names, the same kind of crisis is also here
 do congress alag-alag naam se hai
 NCP leader Ajit Pawar has said that he would not like to work anymore under the leadership of Prithviraj Chauhan
 congress ne chouhan ko hi netaa banaaya he
 Prithviraj Chauhan has also said that we are considering all seats, if the alliance could not be formed
 congress ne kaha he ki do din intazaar kiijie
 Meanwhile, Raj Thackeray of MNS is alone
 jaise loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle gadakari kii unase mulaakaat par sena naaraaz ho gai thi
 Like when in 2012 Narendra Modi called him to Ahmedabad during his swearing in as the Chief Minister
 unke saath koi philhal nahin baat kar rahaa he
 Therefore, the election of Maharashtra has become national
 gathbandhan tutaa to maharashtra kaa chunaav sidhe narendra modi or amit shah ke liye litmus test ho jayega
 Had the UP and Bihar assembly elections not been cheated, the BJP would have decided by now

 At the ncp's Foundation Day function in Pune on Sunday, Sharad Pawar said that the bjp's graph is constantly coming down
 unhone kaha ki haal ke upachunaav nateezon se desh kii janata kaa mood badalata dikhaai de rahaa he or sabhi badlaav chaahate hai
 He called for a ban on the use of evms for voting from all opposition parties, hoping to strengthen opposition unity in the upcoming elections

 Omar supported the Article giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir and said that it is acting as a bridge between the state (jammu and Kashmir) and the rest of the country
 unhone buudhvaar ko vidhansabha main yah baat kahi
 On Modi's challenge to debate Article 370 anytime, Omar said, "he (modi) is silent now
" umr ne daawa kiya ki tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kabhi anuchhed 370 ko khatm karne kii maang nahin kii
 He said that when it was time to abolish Article 370, you did not, now there are elections, then you are raising this issue regarding vote bank politics
 
 
 yah durbhagyapurna he ki modi jammu aate hai or kehete hai ki anuchhed 370 par bahes ho
 Omar had said at a rally in Srinagar on 6 December, if he (modi) wanted to argue with me on Article 370, tell me where and when to talk about it
 yahaan tak ki yadi vah ahmedabad main bahes karnaa chaahate hai, to ham kisi bhi vakt iske liye taiyaar hai
 Omar said that those people (modi) who want to sit on a big chair in the country also have no knowledge about Article 370

 However, with this, the lead character of the film, Kabir Singh, has become the gritty eye of many Feminists
 feminists grups main film kii is baat ko lekar aalochana ho rahi he ki kabir singh kaa ravaiya apni garlfriend ke prati behad regrassive he or is kairactor ke sahare nari dweshi soch ko pramot karne kii koshish ho rahi he
 There are also allegations that attempts are being made to promote behavior like Kabir Singh and his angry, regressive mindset is ignited simply because he is a topper
 ye film box offis par hit sabit ho chuki he, haalanki ye kai soshal grups ke bich charchaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 In today's era, women may be protesting against such behavior on social media, but India Today Data Intelligence Unit has found that more women than men justify characters like Kabir Singh in real life
 2015-16 ke neshnal family health survey (enegechaes-4) ke data ke anusaar, 15-49 aayu varg kii 51 pratishat mahilaon ko lagata he ki ek pati kaa saat vajahon se apni patni ko peetna uchit he
 At the same time, 42 percent of men justify violence against wife
 neshnal family health survey ke data ke anusaar, mahilaon kii unke patiyon kii ore se hinsa ko jaij tehraane ke aankade 2005-06 ke baad se zyada nahin sudhare hai
 The survey found that 54 per cent of women in 2005-06 had justified violence by husbands with their wives, which has come down to 51 per cent in 2015-16
 iske vipareet, purushon kii sankhya main 9 pratishat kii giravat ai he, jo apni patni ke khilaaf hinsa ko sahi tehraate hai
 Whereas in 2005‚Äì06, some 51 percent of men believed it was right to beat up their wife, 10 years later the number came down to 42 percent
 aakhir ve kyon sochati hai ki pati kii hinsa jaij he ?ye saat vajahen jisamen patni ko peetna jaij tehraaya gaya he wo hai - saas-sasur kaa anadar karnaa, pati ko bivi par bevafaayee kaa shaq hona, khaanaa dhang se naa bananaa, pati ke saath bahes karnaa, pati ko bina bataae ghar se nikalnaa, bacchon yaa ghar kii dekhbhaal naa karnaa or pati ke saath shaareerik sambandh banane se manaa karnaa jaise kaaran shaamil hai
 Of these seven reasons, the biggest reason is believed to be disrespect towards the mother-in-law
 ise lekar kai mahilaon or purushon ne patniyon ke khilaaf hinsa ko jaij tehraaya he
 While 37 percent of the women believe that it is right to beat the husband's wife for disrespecting the mother-in-law, 29 percent of the men consider it right to beat the wife for insulting the family
 is survey main patni ke khilaaf hinsa kaa doosraa sabase bada kaaran ghar kii andekhi yaa bacchon kii dekhbhaal naa karnaa he
 There were 33 percent women who believed that it was okay to beat wives for not taking care of family and children, while in this case only 20 percent of men have justified violence against wife
 patni par shaq hona, pati ko bina bataae ghar chale janaa or bahes karnaa bhi kuch aise kaaran the jo patni ke saath gharelu hinsa ke liye mahilaon or purushon dwaara sahi tehraae gaye hai
 Women are entitled to violence if they refuse sexual relations with their husbands? In this case, most men and women have termed domestic violence as wrong
 purushon ke maamle main ye sankhya negative main chali jaati he
 9 percent of the men believed that in such a case there should be domestic violence against the woman, 13 percent believe that if the wives refuse to have a relationship with the husband, then they are entitled to violence
 kis vajah ke chalate purush apni patniyon ko peetate hai ?- jitna adhik nashe main pati, patni ke khilaaf utani hi adhik hinsapati jitani zyada sharaab peetaa he utani hi patni ko hinsa jhelni padati he
 The character of Kabir Singh is an alcoholic but he does not kill his wife after drinking alcohol
 haalanki, bharat kii zyaadaatar mahilaon kii sthiti itani behatar nahin he
 Drinking and domestic violence have also witnessed a very close relationship
 keval 22 pratishat mahilaayein aisi thim jinke pati sharaab nahin pite hai lekin phir bhi unhone gharelu hinsa jheli he
 According to the husband's habit of drinking alcohol, there is a decrease or increase in domestic violence
 77 pratishat mahilaayein aisi hai jinhen gharelu hinsa kaa saamana karnaa padaa he or in mahilaon ke pati aksar sharaab pite hai
 - Less educated, less economical women are more likely to suffer domestic violence, the more the NFS-4 report shows that the better the social status of a woman is, the less the chances of domestic violence with her
 padhi-likhi or aarthik rup se sampann mahilaon ko kam padhi-likhi or garib mahilaon kii tulana main kam gharelu hinsa kaa shikaar hona padataa he
 Of the women who have studied up to class XII, 18‚Äì19 percent of such women have faced domestic violence while 41 have never gone to school in their lives
 3 pratishat mahilaon ne gharelu hinsa jheli he phir wo shaareerik hinsa ho, maansik ho, sexuel yaa imotional hinsa
 There is also a deep connection between women fearing husbands and domestic violence
 is survey ke anusaar, jo mahilaayein apane pati se behad darati hai, unke saath gharelu hinsa hone kii sambhaavna 58 pratishat adhik hoti he vahiin jin mahilaon ne kabhi apane pati se pitane kaa khauf nahin khaaya he, aisi 32 pratishat mahilaon ke saath hi gharelu hinsa kii sambhaavna hoti he
 The issue of employment of wives revealed that a lot of men are not happy with the jobs of wives and that women are more likely to suffer domestic violence than illiterate women
 survey ke natizon ke anusaar, 39 pratishat naukari pesha mahilaon ke saath gharelu hinsa kii sambhaavna zyada hoti he vahiin anpadh mahila ke liye ye aankada 26 pratishat rah jaataa he

 com / cqisalyrfu At the beginning of the second phase of the odd-even scheme, the level of air pollution was somewhat 'reduced', but after the fire on 22nd April there was a 'sudden increase' in the fields and forests

 The organization says, 'analysis of NASA satellite photographs showed large-scale crop fire incidents in Punjab and Haryana around 19 April, which could also be the reason for rising air pollution levels

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The statement of Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has been patrolled by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 venkaiya naidu ne karjamaafee ko fishan kaha tha
 Kejriwal has said that how can the debt waiver of farmers be considered fashion? The farmer of the country is going through a difficult phase and debt waiver helps him
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal ne naidu ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki deshbhar main kisaanon kii badahaali kii khabaren saamne aa rahi hai
 It tells the truth of the country's farmer
 wo kheti ke liye liya gayakarj vapaskarne kii haalat main nahin hai
 In such a situation, it is the duty of the government to give relief to the farmers by waiving loans
 kejariwal ne centre sarkaar par naidu ke bayaan ke bahaane tanj bhi ksaa or kaha ki akele uttar pradesh ke kisaanon par 36 hazaar karod kaa karj he
 It should be forgiven but it is not happening
 jabaki kuch bade-bade logon kehjaron karod ke karjemaf kar die gaye
 Kejriwal also cited Vijay Mallya's debt in the gestures and said that it is completely wrong to call debt waiver as fashion
 yah kisaanon kii jarurat he
 Significantly, Union Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu had said in a statement that the debt waiver of farmers has now become a fashion in the country
 aisa bahut hi kathin paristhiti main hona chahie, lekin ab rajya sarkarein kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne main lagi hai
 Most people do not have a well-intentioned view of personal finance
 ve apane kharchon se jo paisa batch jaataa he, usee ko nivesh karte hai, na ki nivesh ke liye alag se koi yojana banaate hai
 Or invest money in various schemes, not in any scheme that suits their needs
 iskaa nateeja yah hota he ki ve jindagi kii jaruraton ko puraa nahin kar pate hai
 Financial planning helps you in meeting your future goals
 yah safar shuru karne ke liye aapako in baton kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Knowing the financial situation The first step is to prepare a budget outline for financial planning
 isse aapako apni vittiya sthiti kii sahi jaankaree ho jaati he
 To make a budget, first of all make a list of income from your sources like salary, rent, or interest etc
 iske baad apane sabhi kharchon kaa hisaab laga len jisamen beemaa kaa bhugtan, bacchon kii skool fees aadi shaamil hon
 These expenses may vary slightly according to the duration, but make a sum of them and divide them according to the month
 isse pataa ho jayega ki aapke paas nivesh ke liye kitna paisa batch rahaa he
 Jeevan Kumar, head of investment consulting at Geojit Financial Services, says, "if you don't do this preparation, there may be a problem with the budget in your plan
 ''jokhim kaa dhyaan rakhenvitiya yojana banaate samay iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhana jaruri he ki jivan main aakasmik samasya bhi aa sakati he, jaise ki naukari chali janaa yaa achaanak koi badi beemaari kaa kharch aa janaa
 By preparing for it first, you will not have to withdraw money from your savings or borrow from anyone
 sabase pehle aap ek aakasmik nidhi bana len taaki aap 3-6 maheene tak apana kharch vahan kar saken
 You can keep this money in a liquid fund
 aap is paise ko kam avadhi ke phixd diposit main bhi rakh sakate hai jisamen jarurat padane par paisa (50,000 ru
 Or 90 percent of the investment, which is relatively low)
 madhyam avadhi (teen saal se upar) ke bank epady par tex kaa bhi phayda miltaa he
 After this, you should also get medical insurance for yourself and your family
 saamaanya niyam ke anusaar aapke medical kii beemaa raashi aapaki masik aay kii 10 guna honi chahie jo 20 guna tak bhi ho sakati he
 Compared to the individual health insurance policy for the family members, such a policy should be taken in which the whole family has insurance
 yah sasta padataa he
 You can also take a top-up plan
 iske saath aapako ek acchhee jivan beemaa policy bhi leni chahie
 Pure term plans are the best and cheap as they provide more life insurance at a lower cost
 apane lakshya kaa aarthik mulya nirdhaarit karenyah bahut jaruri he ki aap apane lakshya kaa aarthik mulya nirdhaarit karen, taaki yah tay kar saken ki aapako kitna paisa bachaane kii jarurat he
 Keep inflation in mind also
 jivan kumaar kehete hai, ''aapako mahangaai kii dar kii gananaa bahut saavdhaanee se kerani chahie kyonki lambii avadhi main gananaa main thodi-si kami bhi bada antar laa sakati he
 "you should create different portfolios for different purposes
 rule of 72 kii sahaayta se aap apane lakshya kii raashi nirdhaarit kar sakate hai
 Divide the number of 72 by the estimated rate of inflation (say 6 percent), then you will know the number of years (in this case 12) in which the prices will double
 jokhim uthaane kii kshamta nirdhaarit karenjokhim uthaane kii kshamta maaloom hone se aapako rin-equity anupaat ko nirdhaarit karne main madad milti he
 a general rule for calculating how much risk you can afford for equity is: Reduce your age from 100
 is tarah agar aapaki umr 30 saal he to aapaki portpholio kaa 70 pratishat equity main hona chahie
 Loans include options such as bank fds, small savings schemes and debt mutual funds
 equity main apana paisa lagane ke liye aap sheyaron yaa equity mutual funds main nivesh kaa jariya apana sakate hai
 For short-term goals, investing in volatile sources such as the stock market is not good
 lekin dirghakaalin lakshyon main jaise ki ritairement ko dhyaan rakhte hue aap equity main zyada paisa laga sakate hai kyonki lambii avadhi main unase zyada laabh hota he
 Investing more money in equities can make your portfolio risky, although debt-based schemes offer relatively low returns
 isliye aapako donon kaa sahi mishran apnaane kii jarurat he
 Depending on the desired rate of investment, depending on your debt-equity ratio, you can calculate the expected rate of return on your investment
 equity main jitna adhik nivesh karenge, aapke laabh kii dar bhi utani hi adhik hone kii sambhaavna hogi
 You can calculate how much you need to invest per month, depending on the value of the goals, the duration and the rate of expected return on investment, an amount that can also be increased as your income increases
 agar aap utani rakam kaa nivesh nahin kar sakate hai to bajet par dobaaraa vichaar karen or gaiyr-jaruri kharchon main katautee karen
 Tax savings Most people invest in tax-saving mutual funds or endowment schemes and think that they have completed tax saving
 tibianji capital adwisers ke sansthaapak or siio tarun biraani kehete hai, ''agar aap alag-alag tareekon se apane nivesh kii yojana banaate hai to aap apane niveshon se tex main bachat kar sakate hai
 "the choice of the right plan is very important
 aapako aisa karte samay milane vaale laabh ke saath-saath lock-in avadhi, paripakvata par tex aadi kaa vichaar karnaa chahie
 You get tax deductible on life and health insurance premiums
 isi tarah lesaus or eulip main bhi, saath hi aap equity main bhi nivesh kar sakate hai
 Five-year FD and PPF are also equally beneficial in the medium and long term respectively

 jab twachaa cancer se khud ko bachaane kii baat ho, to man main thodaa dar hona jaruri he
 Researchers say that people with skin cancer fear and anxiety choose to apply sunscreen to the skin, rather than knowing the reasons for causing the disease and taking precautions
 america main uniwarsity of bafphelo main sahaayak professor mark kivinemi ne kaha, shodh main pataa chalaa ki chikitsak logon ko sanscrine ke istemaal ke liye protsaahit karne ke dauraan marij kii bhaawanaaon ko zyada dhyaan main rakhana chaahate hai
 As part of the research, around 1,500 people were asked questions related to their sunscreen use
 in logon ko vyaktigat rup se twachaa ke cancer kaa anubhav nahin tha
 The participants were asked questions related to estimating the risk of skin cancer and their concern about it
 kul pratibhaagiyon main se 32 pratishat ne kaha ki vah kabhi bhi sanscrine kaa istemaal nahin karte jabaki 14 pratishat kaa jawaab tha ki ve hameshaa sanscrine kaa istemaal karte hai
 In every case, it has been seen that people's concern about skin cancer directly affects their behavior rather than the desire to get information about it and as the anxiety of people increases, the use of sunscreen increases
 kivinemi ne kaha, "yah shodh isliye mahatvapurn he, kyonki zyaadaatar maamalon main ham saarvajanik swasthya sanchaar ke kshetra main jo kuch bhi karte hai, vah jaankariyon or soochna ke vistaar par kendrit hota he
 "he said," By not controlling our emotions we lose the effect of behavior
 "yah shodh jarnal bihevaral medicin main prakashit hui he
 Thanks to all those who rekindled the controversy of speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai
 yahi vivaad kabhi vande maataram ko lekar hota tha or hota rahaa he or bharat mata kii jai ko lekar
 There is a difference of many years between the development journey of Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata but it is difficult to tell exactly when the two complement each other
 in vivaadon se hamen yakeen hota he ki ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 We have not gone anywhere, right there
 bharat kii raajnneeti ne pehle bhi is vivaad kaa saamana kiya he or aage jab bhi hoga saamana kar legi
 There is no problem in speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai or not
 samasya he ki aap koun hote hai bolne vaale ki bharat mata kii jai hi bolo yaa deshbhakt hone kaa yahi antim pramaan kyon he
 It is being debated anyway
 kuch tark is kheme ke log jeet rahe hai to kuch tark us kheme ke log
 The referee is upset that the match gets tied early, that he runs home
 yah sach he ki bharat mata he lekin kya yah bhi sach he ki bharat mata hameshaa se thi
 When did we first see Bharat Mata as we see it today
 puraani dilli ke calendar postaron kii dukaan main milane vaali bharat mata kii tasveeron ko dekhiegaa kabhi
 You will know that there is so much diversity in the nature of Mother India
 kai shodh chaatro ne in calendar or postaron main devi-devtaa se lekar bharat mata kii vikaas yatra kaa gahan adhyayan kiya he
 Many people like Jyotindra Jain, Mrinalini Sinha, Geeti Sen and Sadan Jha study nationalism, all aspects of it through these photographs
 sumati ramasvami ne bhi ek kitaab likhi he THE GODESS AND THE NATION, MAPPING MOTHER INDIA
 Zuban's publisher Urvashi Butalia has allowed the use of photographs and information in this book
 ham antim baat kehane kaa daawa nahin karte magar yahi koshish he ki ham is vivaad ke jariye bharat mata kii vikaas yatra ko samajhen
 Does our Mother India look the same from the beginning as it does today
 har tasviir main bharat mata badal jaati he
 Our effort is just to take you on a journey of history and return from there to talk about something else
 jarur kuch baaten adhuri rah jaaengi or kuch aisi baat bhi hogi jise aap jodna chahenge, lekin iske liye abhi se maafee
 In the Puranas, many verses narrating the nature of the world from the birthplace will be found
 kya mulk kaa vaisaa nakshaa bhi miltaa he jaisaa ham aaj dekhte hai
 Ever wonder if there is no map and globe, then how would you imagine any country
 inke pehle log apane mulk kii kalpana kaise karte honge
 There was also a village and a state within the scope of the country
 ek gaanv se duusare gaanv janaa pardes janaa ho jaataa tha
 Vinoba Bhave once said in a pinch somewhere that one word is nation
 aglaa shabd he maharashtra or teesraa shabd he sau raashtra
 So there are regions ranging from a state with a name of a hundred nations in our nation
 is raashtra kii ek mata bharat mata kii jai bolne ko lekar vivaad ho rahaa he
 Our first Bharat Mata, conceived by Abanindranath Tagore
 tasveeron ke zariye logon ne pehali baar is bharat maa kaa didaar kiya tha
 During the Swadeshi movement in 1905, when the form of Mother India emerged from Abanindranath Tagore's brush, the imagination of people dreaming of freedom of the country caught fire
 jab yah pehali baar ek patrika main chhapi to sheershak tha spirit aaf mandar india
 Abanindranath Tagore had previously named her Banga Mata and later changed it to Bharat Mata
 sochie agar pehla naam bang mata hi rah jaataa to bharat mata kii vikaas yatra kisi hoti
 Anandmath had been composed before this picture in Bengal and Vande Mataram was being sung
 is bharat mata ke chaar haath hai
 Education, initiation, food and clothing are in his hands
 azaad bharat kii filmon main yahi roti kapadaa or makaan ban jaataa he
 There is no weapon, there is no flag
 gyaat tasveeron ke hisaab se pehali bharat mata ek saamaanya bengali mahila bhi nazar aati hai
 Soon, many pictures of Mother India began to be made across the country
 krantikari sanghathanon ne bharat mata kii tasveeron kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 During the raids, the English government used to be vigilant as soon as the picture of Bharat Mata was found
 anushilan samiti, ugantar party bharat mata kii tasveeron kaa istemaal karte hai to punjab main bharat mata sosayadi, madras main bharat mata association kaa vajood saamne aata he
 Everyone starts building their own Mother India, but gradually the image of Mother India begins to become almost permanent
 bharat mata ke chaar haath kii jagah do haath ho jate hai
 Initially the flag is seen, then the trident and the sword are seen
 kai tasveeron main tirange kaa bhi aagaman hota he
 Some do not have cycles, some have spinning wheel
 kuch tasveeron main bharat mata ke charnon main srilanka bhi aa jaataa he
 So if you look at the old pictures today, Pakistan and Afghanistan before partition will also be seen
 dekhne waalon ne devi durga main bharat mata ko dekha or bharat mata main maa durga ko
 Abinindranath Tagore's Mother India is neither with Bengal nor with trident due to Bengal
 kai tasveeron main sher ke rup bhi alag-alag dikhte hai
 Somewhere the lion is roaring, and somewhere it is calm with victory
 kuch tasveeron main sher ko is tarah se bhi dekha gaya he ki bharat mata taqatvar british hukumat kii sawari kar rahi hai
 Have taken them under their control
 devi hone ke kaaran kuch logon ko lagata he ki bharat mata to hai magar sabaki mata nahin hai
 Actually there are many modern elements in our freedom struggle, but the freedom movement runs with the Hindustan of the past
 uske pratikon se puri tarah algaav nahin kar paata
 Because of this you will see religious symbols along with nationalism and religious people will claim to be nationalists
 yahaan rashtravaadi se meraa matlab swatantraaa senaanee se he
 Photos of Bharat Mata are found in the north and east, but what was happening in the south
 vahaan bharat mata kii kalpana kaise pahunchati he
 Sumati Ramaswamy has introduced a picture in her book
 20 april 1907 kii he
 In Bengal, Abnindranath Tagore imagines Bharat Mata in 1905 while Mahakavi Subrahmanyam Bharti in the far south prints a photo of Bharat Mata on the front page of his newspaper
 intiya akhbaar kaa naam he
 This picture is printed as the goddess of the new year but she has one hand on the globe
 hindu, muslim, sikh, isai dikh rahe hai, jo naman kar rahe hai
 Then Owaisi did not have any problem as to why he is emerging in the calendar of a goddess
 bharat mata kii kai tasveeron main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai hote hai
 a picture was published by Bharti some time later
 tasviir chap rahi he dakshin bharat main lekin bharat mata kii is tasviir main vande maataram likhaa he devanagari main
 There are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians at the feet of Bharat Mata, standing on the boat
 is tasviir main bharat mata ke ek haath main urdu main kuch likhaa hua he
 It is written Allahu Akbar
 yah sabaki bharat mata hai lekin kya aaj ke jamaane main yah sambhav he
 Often people start seeing Mother in the picture of Mother India and only Goddess Durga in Mother
 bharti ne is tasviir main sirf bharat dekha
 So there is Vande Mataram in Hindi and Allahu Akbar in Urdu
 pradhanmantri narendra modi aksar subrahmanyam bharti kaa zikr karte hai
 After the coming of the Modi government, when the postal stamp of many people was discontinued, but the postage stamps of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bismillah Khan and Subrahmanyam Bharti were regularized
 march 2015 main srilanka kii sansad main pradhanmantri modi ne bhaashan dete hue bharti ki kavita kii kuch panktiyaan padhin thim or kaha tha ki bharti mahaan rashtravaadi kavi the
 Bharti is the first person to be mentioned about whom he made efforts to make sculptures ranging from the picture of Mother India
 varna bahut kam logon kaa pataa chalata he ki banane vaale koun the, banavaane vaale koun the
 There is a great story
 1911 main mahakavi bharti abanindranath kii banaai bharat mata kii murti banane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The sculptor says that this India has not worn any ornaments at all
 to bharti ke ek saathi vivies ayyar kehete hai ki kaise honge gahane
 Foreigners have looted India
 to bharti ne jawaab diya ki kya videshi ganga or yamuna ko bhi lapetakar le gaye hai
 Our Mother India is empress
 jo bhi he bharat mata kaa vajood he
 Now we can see it
 chahen to apni marzi ke hisaab se bana sakate hai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai may be a slogan but Bharat Mata may not be one
 kai logon ke liye bharat mata wo bharat mata he jinke haath main tirangaa he
 But the picture of Bharat Mata present on the RSS website does not contain the tricolor
 ek haath main bharat maa aashirwad de rahi hai to duusare haath main bhagava dhvaj he
 Before speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai, there is no harm in knowing which Bharat Mata ki Jai is to say
 jinke haath main tirangaa he unki jayakaara lagaani he yaa jinke haath main tirangaa nahin he unki jai-jai kehani he
 By the way, why is there no tricolor in the hands of Bharat Mata on the website of the Sangh
 aresas ke pramukh ne kaha he ki sabko bharat mata kii jai kahana hoga
 He said that the time has come that the new generation will have to tell that they will have to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 par yah apane aap aana chahie or yuvaaon ke vikaas kaa hissaa hona chahie
 Politics is happening about Bharat Mata and Vande Mataram
 isse ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 The problem with political parties is that they never debate this matter honestly, especially the Congress
 jiske adhiveshan main pehali baar vande maataram gaaya gaya ho vah aise ghabraati he jaise kabhi suna na ho
 The BJP claims Bharat Mata Ki Jai in such a way that unless you speak you cannot be a patriot
 maharashtra vidhansabha main jo hua vah ek vidhayak ko baahar kar diya janaa bhar nahin he, hamaari raajnneeti kii haar he
 The defeat is in the sense that she does not stand up properly and put the issue in front of you
 jaise nazaren bachaakar is maamle main congress bhaajapa ho gai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai is more interesting than speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai
 bazaar ne bhi mauka dekh bharat mata kahana shuru kar diya tha
 Before independence, pictures of Indian Gods and Mother India were also used in goods coming from Britain and Germany so that people could buy them as their own
 manchester ke bane videshi kapadon ke jawaab main desi vyapaariyon ne bhi apane utpaadon par bharat mata kii tasviir lagaani shuru kar di
 The name Bharat Mata is also found along with Bharat Mata and Bharat Mata
 maachis kii is dibbi par hind mata kii tasviir he
 The information of when this picture is done could not be found, but whether Bharat Mata is also called Mother India
 kya ab bhi kahi ja sakati he
 India is named from Bharata
 ek purush ke naam par mulk kii pahchaan he lekin bharat mata kya raja bharat kii maa hai
 There is no evidence of this
 ek or tasviir he jisamen bharat mata kii tasviir he magar vah ahmedabad main bane kapade ke thaan par he
 So Bharat Mata is not just a display of patriotism, but through it, the market of devotees can be reached, it was discovered by the market at that time
 tippaniyan When Rahman's Vande Mataram came, this song was going to be on the fashion show
 darasal deshbhakti kaa yahi swaabhaavik rup hota he
 We can use it whenever we want
 azaad bharat main bhi bazaar ne bharat mata kaa khub sahaara liya
 It is written in a picture above all where our good Hindustan is
 bich main bharat kaa nakshaa bana he
 In the middle of the map is Bharat Mata
 bharat mata rath par savaar he jise sher khinch rahaa he
 There is a tricolor in the hand
 ek haath main sher kii lagaam he
 The bottom edge reads: Happy tea today for Republic Day
 neeche ekta kapur ke lokapriy serial kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi kii bahuen hai
 From Ba to Tulsi
 tulsi kii aaj ek swatantra raajnneetik pahchaan he or ve bharat kii maanav sansaadhan mantri hai
 She was an artist then but even today many mps advertise
 sachin tendulkar, manoj tiwari, hema malini
 
 
 
 bharat mata kii mahima jitani aprampar he utani hi tasveeron kii vividhta apaar he
 In these pictures, Gandhi is blessing Mother India and sometimes Gandhi is giving Mother India
 ek tasviir main gandhi bharat mata kii god main hai
 In many places, Gandhi Netaji is also seen in the form of Dev among the clouds
 yah tasviren bataati hai ki swatantraaa andolan ne uplabdh pratikon kaa hi istamaal kiya logon tak sandesh pahunchane ke liye
 These pictures were similar to television and tweeters through which people saw Nehru, Gandhi saw Azad and Bhagat Singh
 ek tasviir main nehru tirange ko salaam kar rahe hai lekin vaise salaam nahin kar rahe jaise aam taur par karte hai
 Here Nehru's hand is near the chest
 aam taur par sangh ke log is tarah se salaam karte hai
 Bharat Mata is free from bondage
 unke donon haath shikanjon ko tod khule hue hai
 All the people standing under the picture are saluting by taking their hands near the chest
 main bahut zyaada is tarah kii salaami ke itihaas main nahin janaa chahta
 You will see pictures of Bharat Mata found in the shop of calendar posters of Old Delhi
 pataa chalegaa ki bharat mata ke swaroop kii kitni vividhta he
 Many research students have deeply studied the development journey of Mother Goddess to Goddess in these calendars and posters
 jyotindra jain, mrinalini sinha, geeti sen or sadan jha jaise kai log in tasveeron ke jariye rashtrawaad, uske tamaam pahalu kaa adhyayan karte hai
 Sumati Ramaswamy has also written a book THE GODESS AND THE NATION, MAPPING MOTHER INDIA
 jubaan kii prakaashak urvashi butalia ne is kitaab kii tasveeron or jaankaree ke istemaal kii ijazat de di he
 We do not claim to have said the last thing, but this is an attempt to understand the development journey of Mother India through this dispute
 kya hamaari bharat mata shuru se waisi hi dikhti he jaisi aaj dikhti hai
 Mother Bharat changes in every picture
 hamaari koshish bas itani he, aapako itihaas kii yatra par le chalem or vahaan se lautakar kuch or baat karen
 Certain things will remain incomplete and there will be something that you would like to add, but apologies for this
 puraanon main janmabhumi se lekar jagat ke swaroop ko bayaan karne vaale tamaam shloke milenge
 Is the same map of the country as we see today? kabhi sochiega gar nakshaa or globe na ho to aap kisi bhi mulk kii kalpana kaise karenge
 How would people imagine their country before them
 desh ke daayre main to gaanv bhi tha or rajya bhi
 Going from one village to another became known as Pardes
 vinoba bhaave ne ek baar chutki lete hue kahin kaha tha ki ek shabd he raashtra
 The next word is Maharashtra and the third word is hundred nations
 to hamaare raashtra main ek se lekar sau raashtra vaale naam ke rajya se lekar kshetra maujuud hai
 There is a dispute about speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai, one mother of this nation
 abanindranath tagaur kii kalpanashiltaa se bani hamaari pehali bharat mata
 Through photographs, people had seen this Mother India for the first time
 1905 main swadeshi andolan ke dauraan abanindranath tagaur kii kuchi se jab bharat mata kaa swaroop avatarit hua to desh kii azaadi kaa sapana dekh rahe logon kii kalpanaaon main aag lag gai
 When it first appeared in a magazine, it was titled Spirit of Mandar India
 abanindranath tagaur ne pehle inkaa naam bang mata rakhaa tha baad main bharat mata kar diya
 Think if Bharat Mata's development journey would have been like the first name Bang Mata
 us bengal main is tasviir se pehle aanandamath kii rachana ho chuki thi or vande maataram gaaya jane laga tha
 This Bharat Mata has four hands
 shiksha, diksha, ann or vastra hai inke haathon main
 In the films of independent India, this bread becomes cloth and house
 koi hathiyaar nahin he koi jhanda nahin he
 According to the known photographs, the first Bharat Mata is also a normal Bengali woman
 jaldi hi desh bhar main bharat mata kii anek tasviren banane lageen
 Revolutionary organizations started using photographs of Bharat Mata
 chhaapon ke dauraan bharat mata kii tasviir milte hi angreji hukumat chaukanni ho jaati thi
 Anushilan Samiti, Yugantar Party use photographs of Bharat Mata and Bharat Mata Society in Punjab, Bharat Mata Association in Madras comes into existence
 sab apni-apni bharat mata gadhane lagate hai lekin dhire-dhire tasveeron main bharat mata kaa rup kareeb-kareeb sthai hone lagata he
 Bharat Mata has two hands instead of four
 shuru main dhvaj dikhataa he phir trishul or talwaar dikhne lagata he
 The tricolor also appears in many photographs
 kisi main chakra nahin he to kisi main charkha he
 In some pictures, Sri Lanka also comes at the feet of Mother India
 to aaj agar aap puraani tasveeron ko dekhenge to vibhaajan se pehle kaa pakistan or afghanistan bhi nazar aayega
 Viewers saw Bharat Mata in Goddess Durga and Mother Durga in Mother India
 abanindranath tagaur kii bharat mata bengal kii hone ke kaaran na to sher ke saath hai na trishul ke saath
 The lion forms also look different in many photographs
 kahin sher gurraa rahaa he to kahin vijayi bhav se shant he
 In some pictures, the lion is also seen in a way that Bharat Mata is riding the mighty British rule
 unhen apane lagaam main le liya he
 Due to being a goddess, some people think that Bharat is mother but not everyone's mother
 darasal hamaari azaadi kii ladaai main kai aadhunik tatv hai magar swatantraaa andolan ateet ke hindustan ke saath chalata he
 Is not completely detached from its symbols
 is vajah se aapako rashtrawaad ke saath dharmik pratik dikhenge or dharmik vyakti rashtravaadi hone kaa daawa karte milenge
 By nationalist here i mean freedom fighter
 uttar or purab kii bharat mata kii tasviren to milti hai lekin dakshin main kya ho rahaa tha
 How does the imagination of Mother India reach there
 sumati ramasvami ne apni kitaab main ek tasviir pesh kii he
 20 April 1907
 bengal main abanindranath tagaur 1905 main bharat mata kii kalpana karte hai to sudur dakshin main mahakavi subrahmanyam bharti apane akhbaar ke mukhya prishth par bharat mata kii tasviir chhapate hai
 Intia is the name of the newspaper
 yah tasviir nae saal kii devi ke rup main chhapi he lekin unka ek haath globe par he
 Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians are seen, who are bowing
 tab to kisi ovaisi ko dikkat nahin hui ki ek devi ke calendar main ve kyon sheesh nava rahe hai
 Many pictures of Bharat Mata are Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian
 ek tasviir ko bharti ne kuch samay baad chapa tha
 The picture is printed in South India but in this picture of Mother India, Vande Mataram is written in Devanagari
 bharat mata ke charnon main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai hai, naav par khadey hai
 In this picture there is something written in Urdu in one hand of Bharat Mata
 yah likhaa hua he allaaho akbar
 This is the mother of all India, but is it possible in today's era? aksar log bharat mata kii tasviir main mata dekhne lag jate hai or mata main sirf devi durga
 Bharti only saw India in this picture
 isliye vahaan hindi main vandemataram he or urdu main allaaho akbar
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi often mentions Subrahmanyam Bharti
 modi sarkaar aane ke baad jab kai logon ke dak tikat ko band kar diya gaya tha magar bal gangadhar tilak, bismillah kaan or subrahmanyam bharti ke dak tikat ko niyamit karavaaya gaya tha
 In March 2015, Prime Minister Modi made a speech in the Parliament of Sri Lanka, read a few lines of Bharti's poem and said that Bharti was a great nationalist poet
 bharti pehle shaks hai jinke bare main zikr miltaa he ki unhone bharat mata kii tasviir se lekar murtiyon banane ke prayaas kiye
 Otherwise, very few people know who was the creator, who was the builder
 ek bada jabardast kissa miltaa he
 In 1911, Mahakavi attempts to make a statue of Bharat Mata made by Bharati Abanindranath
 murtikar kahata he ki is bharat ne kuch gahane hi nahin pahane hai
 So VVS Iyer, a partner of Bharti, says how will jewelry
 videshiyon ne bharat ko lut liya he
 So Bharti replied if the foreigners had also taken Ganga and Yamuna under wraps
 hamaari bharat mata to samraji hai
 Whatever it is, Mother India exists
 ab ham use dekh sakate hai
 If you want, you can make it according to your wish
 bharat mata kii jai ek naaraa ho saktaa he lekin bharat mata ek nahin ho sakati he
 For many people, Bharat Mata is the Bharat Mata who holds the tricolor in her hand
 lekin aresas kii website par jo bharat mata kii tasviir maujuud hai usamen tirangaa nahin he
 In one hand Bharat Maa is blessing and in the other hand there is saffron flag
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se pehle jaan lene main buraai nahin ki kis bharat mata kii jai kahana he
 Those who have the tricolor in their hands have to be cheered or those who do not have the tricolor in their hands
 vaise sangh kii website par jo bharat mata he unke haath main tirangaa kyon nahin he
 The RSS chief has said that everyone has to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 unhone kaha ki vakt aa gaya he ki nai peedi ko bataanaa hoga ki unhen bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 But it should come on its own and should be a part of the development of the youth
 bharat mata or vande maataram ko lekar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 There is no need to panic
 raajnneetik dalon kii dikkat yahi he ki ve kabhi is maamle par eemaandaaree se bahes nahin karte, khaskar congress
 In whose session Vande Mataram is sung for the first time, she is nervous as never heard
 bhaajapa bharat mata kii jai kii daavedaari aise karti he ki jab tak aap bologe nahin aap deshbhakt ho hi nahin sakate
 What happened in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is not enough to throw out an MLA, our politics is defeated
 haar is myne main he ki vah thik se khadi hokar mudde ko aapke saamne rakhti nahin he
 After saving eyes, Congress became BJP in this matter
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se kahin zyada dilachasp he bharat mata kii vikaas yatra
 The market too had started saying Bharat Mata as an opportunity
 azaadi se pehle britain or germany se aane vaale saamaanon main bhartiya devi devataaon kii tasveeron or bharat mata kii tasviir kaa bhi istemaal hone laga tha taaki log unhen apana samajhakar kharidne lagen
 In response to Manchester-made foreign clothing, domestic merchants also began to photograph Bharat Mata on their products
 bharat mata or bharat maa ke saath ek jagah hind mata kaa naam bhi miltaa he
 There is a picture of Hindu Mother on this box of matches
 yah tasviir kab kii he isaki jaankaree nahin mil saki magar kya bharat mata hind mata bhi kahi jaati hogi
 Can it still be said bharat kaa naam bharat se hua he
 The name of a man is identified by the country but Bharat Mata is the mother of King Bharata
 iskaa koi pramaan nahin miltaa he
 There is another picture which has a picture of Bharat Mata but it is on a cloth station made in Ahmedabad
 to bharat mata sirf deshbhakti kaa pradarshan nahin he balki inke zariye bhakton kii jeb tak bhi pahunchaa ja saktaa he isaki khoj us vakt ke bazaar ne tabhi kar lee thi
 The comments rahamaan kaa jab vande maataram aayaa tha tab is gane par fishan sho tak hone laga tha
 Actually this is the natural form of patriotism
 ham jab chahen jahaan chahen istemaal kar saken
 In independent India also, the market took a lot of support from Mother India
 ek tasviir main upar likhaa he saare jahaan se acha hindustan hamaara
 a map of India is made in the middle
 nakshe ke bich main bharat mata hai
 Bharat Mata is riding the chariot which is being pulled by a lion
 haath main tirangaa he
 The lion has a halter in one hand
 neeche kinare likhaa he ganatantr diwas kii shubhakamanaayen today chaay
 Below are the daughters-in-law of Ekta Kapoor's popular serial Ki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi
 ba se lekar tulsi tak hai
 Tulsi today has an independent political identity and is India's Human Resources Minister
 ve tab kalakaar thim lekin aaj bhi kai saansad vigyaapan to karte hi hai
 Sachin Tendulkar, Manoj Tiwari, Hema Malini
 
 
 
 The diversity of pictures is immense as is the glory of Mother India
 in tasveeron main kabhi bharat mata ko gandhi aashirwad de rahe hai to kabhi gandhi ko bharat mata
 In one picture, Gandhi is in the lap of Mother India
 kai jagahon par gandhi netaji bhi dev rup main badalon ke bich nazar aate hai
 These pictures show that the freedom movement used the available symbols to convey the message to the people
 yah tasviren hi tab ke liye television or twitor ke samaan thim jiske zariye logon ne nehru ko dekha gandhi ko dekha, azaad or bhagat singh ko dekha
 In one picture, Nehru is saluting the tricolor but is not saluting like he usually does
 yahaan par nehru kaa haath chaati ke paas he
 Generally the people of the Union salute in this way
 bharat mata bandhanon se mukt hai
 His both hands are open, breaking the screws
 tasviir ke neeche khadey saare log seene ke paas haath le jaakar salaam kar rahe hai
 i do not want to go into the history of such a salute too much
 kya mulk kaa vaisaa nakshaa bhi miltaa he jaisaa ham aaj dekhte hai
 Ever wonder if there is no map and globe, then how would you imagine any country
 inke pehle log apane mulk kii kalpana kaise karte honge
 There was also a village and a state within the scope of the country
 ek gaanv se duusare gaanv janaa pardes janaa ho jaataa tha
 Vinoba Bhave once said in a pinch somewhere that one word is nation
 aglaa shabd he maharashtra or teesraa shabd he sau raashtra
 So there are regions ranging from a state with a name of a hundred nations in our nation
 is raashtra kii ek mata bharat mata kii jai bolne ko lekar vivaad ho rahaa he
 Our first Bharat Mata, conceived by Abanindranath Tagore
 tasveeron ke zariye logon ne pehali baar is bharat maa kaa didaar kiya tha
 During the Swadeshi movement in 1905, when the form of Mother India emerged from Abanindranath Tagore's brush, the imagination of people dreaming of freedom of the country caught fire
 jab yah pehali baar ek patrika main chhapi to sheershak tha spirit aaf mandar india
 Abanindranath Tagore had previously named her Banga Mata and later changed it to Bharat Mata
 sochie agar pehla naam bang mata hi rah jaataa to bharat mata kii vikaas yatra kisi hoti
 Anandmath had been composed before this picture in Bengal and Vande Mataram was being sung
 is bharat mata ke chaar haath hai
 Education, initiation, food and clothing are in his hands
 azaad bharat kii filmon main yahi roti kapadaa or makaan ban jaataa he
 There is no weapon, there is no flag
 gyaat tasveeron ke hisaab se pehali bharat mata ek saamaanya bengali mahila bhi nazar aati hai
 Soon, many pictures of Mother India began to be made across the country
 krantikari sanghathanon ne bharat mata kii tasveeron kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 During the raids, the English government used to be vigilant as soon as the picture of Bharat Mata was found
 anushilan samiti, ugantar party bharat mata kii tasveeron kaa istemaal karte hai to punjab main bharat mata sosayadi, madras main bharat mata association kaa vajood saamne aata he
 Everyone starts building their own Mother India, but gradually the image of Mother India begins to become almost permanent
 bharat mata ke chaar haath kii jagah do haath ho jate hai
 Initially the flag is seen, then the trident and the sword are seen
 kai tasveeron main tirange kaa bhi aagaman hota he
 Some do not have cycles, some have spinning wheel
 kuch tasveeron main bharat mata ke charnon main srilanka bhi aa jaataa he
 So if you look at the old pictures today, Pakistan and Afghanistan before partition will also be seen
 dekhne waalon ne devi durga main bharat mata ko dekha or bharat mata main maa durga ko
 Abinindranath Tagore's Mother India is neither with Bengal nor with trident due to Bengal
 kai tasveeron main sher ke rup bhi alag-alag dikhte hai
 Somewhere the lion is roaring, and somewhere it is calm with victory
 kuch tasveeron main sher ko is tarah se bhi dekha gaya he ki bharat mata taqatvar british hukumat kii sawari kar rahi hai
 Have taken them under their control
 devi hone ke kaaran kuch logon ko lagata he ki bharat mata to hai magar sabaki mata nahin hai
 Actually there are many modern elements in our freedom struggle, but the freedom movement runs with the Hindustan of the past
 uske pratikon se puri tarah algaav nahin kar paata
 Because of this you will see religious symbols along with nationalism and religious people will claim to be nationalists
 yahaan rashtravaadi se meraa matlab swatantraaa senaanee se he
 Photos of Bharat Mata are found in the north and east, but what was happening in the south
 vahaan bharat mata kii kalpana kaise pahunchati he
 Sumati Ramaswamy has introduced a picture in her book
 20 april 1907 kii he
 In Bengal, Abnindranath Tagore imagines Bharat Mata in 1905 while Mahakavi Subrahmanyam Bharti in the far south prints a photo of Bharat Mata on the front page of his newspaper
 intiya akhbaar kaa naam he
 This picture is printed as the goddess of the new year but she has one hand on the globe
 hindu, muslim, sikh, isai dikh rahe hai, jo naman kar rahe hai
 Then Owaisi did not have any problem as to why he is emerging in the calendar of a goddess
 bharat mata kii kai tasveeron main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai hote hai
 a picture was published by Bharti some time later
 tasviir chap rahi he dakshin bharat main lekin bharat mata kii is tasviir main vande maataram likhaa he devanagari main
 There are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians at the feet of Bharat Mata, standing on the boat
 is tasviir main bharat mata ke ek haath main urdu main kuch likhaa hua he
 It is written Allahu Akbar
 yah sabaki bharat mata hai lekin kya aaj ke jamaane main yah sambhav he
 Often people start seeing Mother in the picture of Mother India and only Goddess Durga in Mother
 bharti ne is tasviir main sirf bharat dekha
 So there is Vande Mataram in Hindi and Allahu Akbar in Urdu
 pradhanmantri narendra modi aksar subrahmanyam bharti kaa zikr karte hai
 After the coming of the Modi government, when the postal stamp of many people was discontinued, but the postage stamps of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bismillah Khan and Subrahmanyam Bharti were regularized
 march 2015 main srilanka kii sansad main pradhanmantri modi ne bhaashan dete hue bharti ki kavita kii kuch panktiyaan padhin thim or kaha tha ki bharti mahaan rashtravaadi kavi the
 Bharti is the first person to be mentioned about whom he made efforts to make sculptures ranging from the picture of Mother India
 varna bahut kam logon kaa pataa chalata he ki banane vaale koun the, banavaane vaale koun the
 There is a great story
 1911 main mahakavi bharti abanindranath kii banaai bharat mata kii murti banane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The sculptor says that this India has not worn any ornaments at all
 to bharti ke ek saathi vivies ayyar kehete hai ki kaise honge gahane
 Foreigners have looted India
 to bharti ne jawaab diya ki kya videshi ganga or yamuna ko bhi lapetakar le gaye hai
 Our Mother India is empress
 jo bhi he bharat mata kaa vajood he
 Now we can see it
 chahen to apni marzi ke hisaab se bana sakate hai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai may be a slogan but Bharat Mata may not be one
 kai logon ke liye bharat mata wo bharat mata he jinke haath main tirangaa he
 But the picture of Bharat Mata present on the RSS website does not contain the tricolor
 ek haath main bharat maa aashirwad de rahi hai to duusare haath main bhagava dhvaj he
 Before speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai, there is no harm in knowing which Bharat Mata ki Jai is to say
 jinke haath main tirangaa he unki jayakaara lagaani he yaa jinke haath main tirangaa nahin he unki jai-jai kehani he
 By the way, why is there no tricolor in the hands of Bharat Mata on the website of the Sangh
 aresas ke pramukh ne kaha he ki sabko bharat mata kii jai kahana hoga
 He said that the time has come that the new generation will have to tell that they will have to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 par yah apane aap aana chahie or yuvaaon ke vikaas kaa hissaa hona chahie
 Politics is happening about Bharat Mata and Vande Mataram
 isse ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 The problem with political parties is that they never debate this matter honestly, especially the Congress
 jiske adhiveshan main pehali baar vande maataram gaaya gaya ho vah aise ghabraati he jaise kabhi suna na ho
 The BJP claims Bharat Mata Ki Jai in such a way that unless you speak you cannot be a patriot
 maharashtra vidhansabha main jo hua vah ek vidhayak ko baahar kar diya janaa bhar nahin he, hamaari raajnneeti kii haar he
 The defeat is in the sense that she does not stand up properly and put the issue in front of you
 jaise nazaren bachaakar is maamle main congress bhaajapa ho gai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai is more interesting than speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai
 bazaar ne bhi mauka dekh bharat mata kahana shuru kar diya tha
 Before independence, pictures of Indian Gods and Mother India were also used in goods coming from Britain and Germany so that people could buy them as their own
 manchester ke bane videshi kapadon ke jawaab main desi vyapaariyon ne bhi apane utpaadon par bharat mata kii tasviir lagaani shuru kar di
 The name Bharat Mata is also found along with Bharat Mata and Bharat Mata
 maachis kii is dibbi par hind mata kii tasviir he
 The information of when this picture is done could not be found, but whether Bharat Mata is also called Mother India
 kya ab bhi kahi ja sakati he
 India is named from Bharata
 ek purush ke naam par mulk kii pahchaan he lekin bharat mata kya raja bharat kii maa hai
 There is no evidence of this
 ek or tasviir he jisamen bharat mata kii tasviir he magar vah ahmedabad main bane kapade ke thaan par he
 So Bharat Mata is not just a display of patriotism, but through it, the market of devotees can be reached, it was discovered by the market at that time
 tippaniyan When Rahman's Vande Mataram came, this song was going to be on the fashion show
 darasal deshbhakti kaa yahi swaabhaavik rup hota he
 We can use it whenever we want
 azaad bharat main bhi bazaar ne bharat mata kaa khub sahaara liya
 It is written in a picture above all where our good Hindustan is
 bich main bharat kaa nakshaa bana he
 In the middle of the map is Bharat Mata
 bharat mata rath par savaar he jise sher khinch rahaa he
 There is a tricolor in the hand
 ek haath main sher kii lagaam he
 The bottom edge reads: Happy tea today for Republic Day
 neeche ekta kapur ke lokapriy serial kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi kii bahuen hai
 From Ba to Tulsi
 tulsi kii aaj ek swatantra raajnneetik pahchaan he or ve bharat kii maanav sansaadhan mantri hai
 She was an artist then but even today many mps advertise
 sachin tendulkar, manoj tiwari, hema malini
 
 
 
 bharat mata kii mahima jitani aprampar he utani hi tasveeron kii vividhta apaar he
 In these pictures, Gandhi is blessing Mother India and sometimes Gandhi is giving Mother India
 ek tasviir main gandhi bharat mata kii god main hai
 In many places, Gandhi Netaji is also seen in the form of Dev among the clouds
 yah tasviren bataati hai ki swatantraaa andolan ne uplabdh pratikon kaa hi istamaal kiya logon tak sandesh pahunchane ke liye
 These pictures were similar to television and tweeters through which people saw Nehru, Gandhi saw Azad and Bhagat Singh
 ek tasviir main nehru tirange ko salaam kar rahe hai lekin vaise salaam nahin kar rahe jaise aam taur par karte hai
 Here Nehru's hand is near the chest
 aam taur par sangh ke log is tarah se salaam karte hai
 Bharat Mata is free from bondage
 unke donon haath shikanjon ko tod khule hue hai
 All the people standing under the picture are saluting by taking their hands near the chest
 main bahut zyaada is tarah kii salaami ke itihaas main nahin janaa chahta

 jiske adhiveshan main pehali baar vande maataram gaaya gaya ho vah aise ghabraati he jaise kabhi suna na ho
 The BJP claims Bharat Mata Ki Jai in such a way that unless you speak you cannot be a patriot
 maharashtra vidhansabha main jo hua vah ek vidhayak ko baahar kar diya janaa bhar nahin he, hamaari raajnneeti kii haar he
 The defeat is in the sense that she does not stand up properly and put the issue in front of you
 jaise nazaren bachaakar is maamle main congress bhaajapa ho gai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai is more interesting than speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai
 bazaar ne bhi mauka dekh bharat mata kahana shuru kar diya tha
 Before independence, pictures of Indian Gods and Mother India were also used in goods coming from Britain and Germany so that people could buy them as their own
 manchester ke bane videshi kapadon ke jawaab main desi vyapaariyon ne bhi apane utpaadon par bharat mata kii tasviir lagaani shuru kar di
 The name Bharat Mata is also found along with Bharat Mata and Bharat Mata
 maachis kii is dibbi par hind mata kii tasviir he
 The information of when this picture is done could not be found, but whether Bharat Mata is also called Mother India
 kya ab bhi kahi ja sakati he
 India is named from Bharata
 ek purush ke naam par mulk kii pahchaan he lekin bharat mata kya raja bharat kii maa hai
 There is no evidence of this
 ek or tasviir he jisamen bharat mata kii tasviir he magar vah ahmedabad main bane kapade ke thaan par he
 So Bharat Mata is not just a display of patriotism, but through it, the market of devotees can be reached, it was discovered by the market at that time
 tippaniyan When Rahman's Vande Mataram came, this song was going to be on the fashion show
 darasal deshbhakti kaa yahi swaabhaavik rup hota he
 We can use it whenever we want
 azaad bharat main bhi bazaar ne bharat mata kaa khub sahaara liya
 It is written in a picture above all where our good Hindustan is
 bich main bharat kaa nakshaa bana he
 In the middle of the map is Bharat Mata
 bharat mata rath par savaar he jise sher khinch rahaa he
 There is a tricolor in the hand
 ek haath main sher kii lagaam he
 The bottom edge reads: Happy tea today for Republic Day
 neeche ekta kapur ke lokapriy serial kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi kii bahuen hai
 From Ba to Tulsi
 tulsi kii aaj ek swatantra raajnneetik pahchaan he or ve bharat kii maanav sansaadhan mantri hai
 She was an artist then but even today many mps advertise
 sachin tendulkar, manoj tiwari, hema malini
 
 
 
 bharat mata kii mahima jitani aprampar he utani hi tasveeron kii vividhta apaar he
 In these pictures, Gandhi is blessing Mother India and sometimes Gandhi is giving Mother India
 ek tasviir main gandhi bharat mata kii god main hai
 In many places, Gandhi Netaji is also seen in the form of Dev among the clouds
 yah tasviren bataati hai ki swatantraaa andolan ne uplabdh pratikon kaa hi istamaal kiya logon tak sandesh pahunchane ke liye
 These pictures were similar to television and tweeters through which people saw Nehru, Gandhi saw Azad and Bhagat Singh
 ek tasviir main nehru tirange ko salaam kar rahe hai lekin vaise salaam nahin kar rahe jaise aam taur par karte hai
 Here Nehru's hand is near the chest
 aam taur par sangh ke log is tarah se salaam karte hai
 Bharat Mata is free from bondage
 unke donon haath shikanjon ko tod khule hue hai
 All the people standing under the picture are saluting by taking their hands near the chest
 main bahut zyaada is tarah kii salaami ke itihaas main nahin janaa chahta
 Soon, many pictures of Mother India began to be made across the country
 krantikari sanghathanon ne bharat mata kii tasveeron kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 During the raids, the English government used to be vigilant as soon as the picture of Bharat Mata was found
 anushilan samiti, ugantar party bharat mata kii tasveeron kaa istemaal karte hai to punjab main bharat mata sosayadi, madras main bharat mata association kaa vajood saamne aata he
 Everyone starts building their own Mother India, but gradually the image of Mother India begins to become almost permanent
 bharat mata ke chaar haath kii jagah do haath ho jate hai
 Initially the flag is seen, then the trident and the sword are seen
 kai tasveeron main tirange kaa bhi aagaman hota he
 Some do not have cycles, some have spinning wheel
 kuch tasveeron main bharat mata ke charnon main srilanka bhi aa jaataa he
 So if you look at the old pictures today, Pakistan and Afghanistan before partition will also be seen
 dekhne waalon ne devi durga main bharat mata ko dekha or bharat mata main maa durga ko
 Abinindranath Tagore's Mother India is neither with Bengal nor with trident due to Bengal
 kai tasveeron main sher ke rup bhi alag-alag dikhte hai
 Somewhere the lion is roaring, and somewhere it is calm with victory
 kuch tasveeron main sher ko is tarah se bhi dekha gaya he ki bharat mata taqatvar british hukumat kii sawari kar rahi hai
 Have taken them under their control
 devi hone ke kaaran kuch logon ko lagata he ki bharat mata to hai magar sabaki mata nahin hai
 Actually there are many modern elements in our freedom struggle, but the freedom movement runs with the Hindustan of the past
 uske pratikon se puri tarah algaav nahin kar paata
 Because of this you will see religious symbols along with nationalism and religious people will claim to be nationalists
 yahaan rashtravaadi se meraa matlab swatantraaa senaanee se he
 Photos of Bharat Mata are found in the north and east, but what was happening in the south
 vahaan bharat mata kii kalpana kaise pahunchati he
 Sumati Ramaswamy has introduced a picture in her book
 20 april 1907 kii he
 In Bengal, Abnindranath Tagore imagines Bharat Mata in 1905 while Mahakavi Subrahmanyam Bharti in the far south prints a photo of Bharat Mata on the front page of his newspaper
 intiya akhbaar kaa naam he
 This picture is printed as the goddess of the new year but she has one hand on the globe
 hindu, muslim, sikh, isai dikh rahe hai, jo naman kar rahe hai
 Then Owaisi did not have any problem as to why he is emerging in the calendar of a goddess
 bharat mata kii kai tasveeron main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai hote hai
 a picture was published by Bharti some time later
 tasviir chap rahi he dakshin bharat main lekin bharat mata kii is tasviir main vande maataram likhaa he devanagari main
 There are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians at the feet of Bharat Mata, standing on the boat
 is tasviir main bharat mata ke ek haath main urdu main kuch likhaa hua he
 It is written Allahu Akbar
 yah sabaki bharat mata hai lekin kya aaj ke jamaane main yah sambhav he
 Often people start seeing Mother in the picture of Mother India and only Goddess Durga in Mother
 bharti ne is tasviir main sirf bharat dekha
 So there is Vande Mataram in Hindi and Allahu Akbar in Urdu
 pradhanmantri narendra modi aksar subrahmanyam bharti kaa zikr karte hai
 After the coming of the Modi government, when the postal stamp of many people was discontinued, but the postage stamps of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bismillah Khan and Subrahmanyam Bharti were regularized
 march 2015 main srilanka kii sansad main pradhanmantri modi ne bhaashan dete hue bharti ki kavita kii kuch panktiyaan padhin thim or kaha tha ki bharti mahaan rashtravaadi kavi the
 Bharti is the first person to be mentioned about whom he made efforts to make sculptures ranging from the picture of Mother India
 varna bahut kam logon kaa pataa chalata he ki banane vaale koun the, banavaane vaale koun the
 There is a great story
 1911 main mahakavi bharti abanindranath kii banaai bharat mata kii murti banane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The sculptor says that this India has not worn any ornaments at all
 to bharti ke ek saathi vivies ayyar kehete hai ki kaise honge gahane
 Foreigners have looted India
 to bharti ne jawaab diya ki kya videshi ganga or yamuna ko bhi lapetakar le gaye hai
 Our Mother India is empress
 jo bhi he bharat mata kaa vajood he
 Now we can see it
 chahen to apni marzi ke hisaab se bana sakate hai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai may be a slogan but Bharat Mata may not be one
 kai logon ke liye bharat mata wo bharat mata he jinke haath main tirangaa he
 But the picture of Bharat Mata present on the RSS website does not contain the tricolor
 ek haath main bharat maa aashirwad de rahi hai to duusare haath main bhagava dhvaj he
 Before speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai, there is no harm in knowing which Bharat Mata ki Jai is to say
 jinke haath main tirangaa he unki jayakaara lagaani he yaa jinke haath main tirangaa nahin he unki jai-jai kehani he
 By the way, why is there no tricolor in the hands of Bharat Mata on the website of the Sangh
 aresas ke pramukh ne kaha he ki sabko bharat mata kii jai kahana hoga
 He said that the time has come that the new generation will have to tell that they will have to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 par yah apane aap aana chahie or yuvaaon ke vikaas kaa hissaa hona chahie
 Politics is happening about Bharat Mata and Vande Mataram
 isse ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 The problem with political parties is that they never debate this matter honestly, especially the Congress
 jiske adhiveshan main pehali baar vande maataram gaaya gaya ho vah aise ghabraati he jaise kabhi suna na ho
 The BJP claims Bharat Mata Ki Jai in such a way that unless you speak you cannot be a patriot

 Bharat Mata has two hands instead of four
 shuru main dhvaj dikhataa he phir trishul or talwaar dikhne lagata he
 The tricolor also appears in many photographs
 kisi main chakra nahin he to kisi main charkha he
 In some pictures, Sri Lanka also comes at the feet of Mother India
 to aaj agar aap puraani tasveeron ko dekhenge to vibhaajan se pehle kaa pakistan or afghanistan bhi nazar aayega
 Viewers saw Bharat Mata in Goddess Durga and Mother Durga in Mother India
 abanindranath tagaur kii bharat mata bengal kii hone ke kaaran na to sher ke saath hai na trishul ke saath
 The lion forms also look different in many photographs
 kahin sher gurraa rahaa he to kahin vijayi bhav se shant he
 In some pictures, the lion is also seen in a way that Bharat Mata is riding the mighty British rule
 unhen apane lagaam main le liya he
 Due to being a goddess, some people think that Bharat is mother but not everyone's mother
 darasal hamaari azaadi kii ladaai main kai aadhunik tatv hai magar swatantraaa andolan ateet ke hindustan ke saath chalata he
 Is not completely detached from its symbols
 is vajah se aapako rashtrawaad ke saath dharmik pratik dikhenge or dharmik vyakti rashtravaadi hone kaa daawa karte milenge
 By nationalist here i mean freedom fighter
 uttar or purab kii bharat mata kii tasviren to milti hai lekin dakshin main kya ho rahaa tha
 How does the imagination of Mother India reach there
 sumati ramasvami ne apni kitaab main ek tasviir pesh kii he
 20 April 1907
 bengal main abanindranath tagaur 1905 main bharat mata kii kalpana karte hai to sudur dakshin main mahakavi subrahmanyam bharti apane akhbaar ke mukhya prishth par bharat mata kii tasviir chhapate hai
 Intia is the name of the newspaper
 yah tasviir nae saal kii devi ke rup main chhapi he lekin unka ek haath globe par he
 Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians are seen, who are bowing
 tab to kisi ovaisi ko dikkat nahin hui ki ek devi ke calendar main ve kyon sheesh nava rahe hai
 Many pictures of Bharat Mata are Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian
 ek tasviir ko bharti ne kuch samay baad chapa tha
 The picture is printed in South India but in this picture of Mother India, Vande Mataram is written in Devanagari
 bharat mata ke charnon main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai hai, naav par khadey hai
 In this picture there is something written in Urdu in one hand of Bharat Mata
 yah likhaa hua he allaaho akbar
 This is the mother of all India, but is it possible in today's era? aksar log bharat mata kii tasviir main mata dekhne lag jate hai or mata main sirf devi durga
 Bharti only saw India in this picture
 isliye vahaan hindi main vandemataram he or urdu main allaaho akbar
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi often mentions Subrahmanyam Bharti
 modi sarkaar aane ke baad jab kai logon ke dak tikat ko band kar diya gaya tha magar bal gangadhar tilak, bismillah kaan or subrahmanyam bharti ke dak tikat ko niyamit karavaaya gaya tha
 In March 2015, Prime Minister Modi made a speech in the Parliament of Sri Lanka, read a few lines of Bharti's poem and said that Bharti was a great nationalist poet
 bharti pehle shaks hai jinke bare main zikr miltaa he ki unhone bharat mata kii tasviir se lekar murtiyon banane ke prayaas kiye
 Otherwise, very few people know who was the creator, who was the builder
 ek bada jabardast kissa miltaa he
 In 1911, Mahakavi attempts to make a statue of Bharat Mata made by Bharati Abanindranath
 murtikar kahata he ki is bharat ne kuch gahane hi nahin pahane hai
 So VVS Iyer, a partner of Bharti, says how will jewelry
 videshiyon ne bharat ko lut liya he
 So Bharti replied if the foreigners had also taken Ganga and Yamuna under wraps
 hamaari bharat mata to samraji hai
 Whatever it is, Mother India exists
 ab ham use dekh sakate hai
 If you want, you can make it according to your wish
 bharat mata kii jai ek naaraa ho saktaa he lekin bharat mata ek nahin ho sakati he
 For many people, Bharat Mata is the Bharat Mata who holds the tricolor in her hand
 lekin aresas kii website par jo bharat mata kii tasviir maujuud hai usamen tirangaa nahin he
 In one hand Bharat Maa is blessing and in the other hand there is saffron flag
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se pehle jaan lene main buraai nahin ki kis bharat mata kii jai kahana he
 Those who have the tricolor in their hands have to be cheered or those who do not have the tricolor in their hands
 vaise sangh kii website par jo bharat mata he unke haath main tirangaa kyon nahin he
 The RSS chief has said that everyone has to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 unhone kaha ki vakt aa gaya he ki nai peedi ko bataanaa hoga ki unhen bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 But it should come on its own and should be a part of the development of the youth
 bharat mata or vande maataram ko lekar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 There is no need to panic
 raajnneetik dalon kii dikkat yahi he ki ve kabhi is maamle par eemaandaaree se bahes nahin karte, khaskar congress
 In whose session Vande Mataram is sung for the first time, she is nervous as never heard
 bhaajapa bharat mata kii jai kii daavedaari aise karti he ki jab tak aap bologe nahin aap deshbhakt ho hi nahin sakate
 What happened in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is not enough to throw out an MLA, our politics is defeated
 haar is myne main he ki vah thik se khadi hokar mudde ko aapke saamne rakhti nahin he
 After saving eyes, Congress became BJP in this matter
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se kahin zyada dilachasp he bharat mata kii vikaas yatra
 The market too had started saying Bharat Mata as an opportunity
 azaadi se pehle britain or germany se aane vaale saamaanon main bhartiya devi devataaon kii tasveeron or bharat mata kii tasviir kaa bhi istemaal hone laga tha taaki log unhen apana samajhakar kharidne lagen
 In response to Manchester-made foreign clothing, domestic merchants also began to photograph Bharat Mata on their products
 bharat mata or bharat maa ke saath ek jagah hind mata kaa naam bhi miltaa he
 There is a picture of Hindu Mother on this box of matches
 yah tasviir kab kii he isaki jaankaree nahin mil saki magar kya bharat mata hind mata bhi kahi jaati hogi
 Can it still be said bharat kaa naam bharat se hua he
 The name of a man is identified by the country but Bharat Mata is the mother of King Bharata
 iskaa koi pramaan nahin miltaa he
 There is another picture which has a picture of Bharat Mata but it is on a cloth station made in Ahmedabad
 to bharat mata sirf deshbhakti kaa pradarshan nahin he balki inke zariye bhakton kii jeb tak bhi pahunchaa ja saktaa he isaki khoj us vakt ke bazaar ne tabhi kar lee thi
 The comments rahamaan kaa jab vande maataram aayaa tha tab is gane par fishan sho tak hone laga tha
 Actually this is the natural form of patriotism
 ham jab chahen jahaan chahen istemaal kar saken
 In independent India also, the market took a lot of support from Mother India
 ek tasviir main upar likhaa he saare jahaan se acha hindustan hamaara
 a map of India is made in the middle
 nakshe ke bich main bharat mata hai
 Bharat Mata is riding the chariot which is being pulled by a lion
 haath main tirangaa he
 The lion has a halter in one hand
 neeche kinare likhaa he ganatantr diwas kii shubhakamanaayen today chaay
 Below are the daughters-in-law of Ekta Kapoor's popular serial Ki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi
 ba se lekar tulsi tak hai
 Tulsi today has an independent political identity and is India's Human Resources Minister
 ve tab kalakaar thim lekin aaj bhi kai saansad vigyaapan to karte hi hai
 Sachin Tendulkar, Manoj Tiwari, Hema Malini
 
 
 
 The diversity of pictures is immense as is the glory of Mother India
 in tasveeron main kabhi bharat mata ko gandhi aashirwad de rahe hai to kabhi gandhi ko bharat mata
 In one picture, Gandhi is in the lap of Mother India
 kai jagahon par gandhi netaji bhi dev rup main badalon ke bich nazar aate hai
 These pictures show that the freedom movement used the available symbols to convey the message to the people
 yah tasviren hi tab ke liye television or twitor ke samaan thim jiske zariye logon ne nehru ko dekha gandhi ko dekha, azaad or bhagat singh ko dekha
 In one picture, Nehru is saluting the tricolor but is not saluting like he usually does
 yahaan par nehru kaa haath chaati ke paas he
 Generally the people of the Union salute in this way
 bharat mata bandhanon se mukt hai
 His both hands are open, breaking the screws
 tasviir ke neeche khadey saare log seene ke paas haath le jaakar salaam kar rahe hai
 i do not want to go into the history of such a salute too much
 devi hone ke kaaran kuch logon ko lagata he ki bharat mata to hai magar sabaki mata nahin hai
 Actually there are many modern elements in our freedom struggle, but the freedom movement runs with the Hindustan of the past
 uske pratikon se puri tarah algaav nahin kar paata
 Because of this you will see religious symbols along with nationalism and religious people will claim to be nationalists
 yahaan rashtravaadi se meraa matlab swatantraaa senaanee se he

 The problem with political parties is that they never debate this matter honestly, especially the Congress

 The BJP claims Bharat Mata Ki Jai in such a way that unless you speak you cannot be a patriot
 maharashtra vidhansabha main jo hua vah ek vidhayak ko baahar kar diya janaa bhar nahin he, hamaari raajnneeti kii haar he
 The defeat is in the sense that she does not stand up properly and put the issue in front of you

 Bharat Mata Ki Jai is more interesting than speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai
 bazaar ne bhi mauka dekh bharat mata kahana shuru kar diya tha

 Sumati Ramaswamy has introduced a picture in her book
 20 april 1907 kii he
 In Bengal, Abnindranath Tagore imagines Bharat Mata in 1905 while Mahakavi Subrahmanyam Bharti in the far south prints a photo of Bharat Mata on the front page of his newspaper
 intiya akhbaar kaa naam he
 This picture is printed as the goddess of the new year but she has one hand on the globe
 hindu, muslim, sikh, isai dikh rahe hai, jo naman kar rahe hai
 Then Owaisi did not have any problem as to why he is emerging in the calendar of a goddess
 bharat mata kii kai tasveeron main hindu, muslim, sikh, isai hote hai
 a picture was published by Bharti some time later
 tasviir chap rahi he dakshin bharat main lekin bharat mata kii is tasviir main vande maataram likhaa he devanagari main
 There are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians at the feet of Bharat Mata, standing on the boat
 is tasviir main bharat mata ke ek haath main urdu main kuch likhaa hua he
 It is written Allahu Akbar
 yah sabaki bharat mata hai lekin kya aaj ke jamaane main yah sambhav he
 Often people start seeing Mother in the picture of Mother India and only Goddess Durga in Mother
 bharti ne is tasviir main sirf bharat dekha
 So there is Vande Mataram in Hindi and Allahu Akbar in Urdu
 pradhanmantri narendra modi aksar subrahmanyam bharti kaa zikr karte hai
 After the coming of the Modi government, when the postal stamp of many people was discontinued, but the postage stamps of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bismillah Khan and Subrahmanyam Bharti were regularized

 Bharti is the first person to be mentioned about whom he made efforts to make sculptures ranging from the picture of Mother India

 There is a great story
 1911 main mahakavi bharti abanindranath kii banaai bharat mata kii murti banane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The sculptor says that this India has not worn any ornaments at all
 to bharti ke ek saathi vivies ayyar kehete hai ki kaise honge gahane
 Foreigners have looted India

 Our Mother India is empress

 Bharat Mata Ki Jai may be a slogan but Bharat Mata may not be one
 kai logon ke liye bharat mata wo bharat mata he jinke haath main tirangaa he
 But the picture of Bharat Mata present on the RSS website does not contain the tricolor
 ek haath main bharat maa aashirwad de rahi hai to duusare haath main bhagava dhvaj he
 Before speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai, there is no harm in knowing which Bharat Mata ki Jai is to say
 jinke haath main tirangaa he unki jayakaara lagaani he yaa jinke haath main tirangaa nahin he unki jai-jai kehani he
 By the way, why is there no tricolor in the hands of Bharat Mata on the website of the Sangh
 aresas ke pramukh ne kaha he ki sabko bharat mata kii jai kahana hoga
 He said that the time has come that the new generation will have to tell that they will have to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 par yah apane aap aana chahie or yuvaaon ke vikaas kaa hissaa hona chahie
 Politics is happening about Bharat Mata and Vande Mataram
 isse ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 The problem with political parties is that they never debate this matter honestly, especially the Congress
 jiske adhiveshan main pehali baar vande maataram gaaya gaya ho vah aise ghabraati he jaise kabhi suna na ho
 The BJP claims Bharat Mata Ki Jai in such a way that unless you speak you cannot be a patriot
 maharashtra vidhansabha main jo hua vah ek vidhayak ko baahar kar diya janaa bhar nahin he, hamaari raajnneeti kii haar he
 The defeat is in the sense that she does not stand up properly and put the issue in front of you
 jaise nazaren bachaakar is maamle main congress bhaajapa ho gai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai is more interesting than speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai

 There is no evidence of this

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi often mentions Subrahmanyam Bharti
 modi sarkaar aane ke baad jab kai logon ke dak tikat ko band kar diya gaya tha magar bal gangadhar tilak, bismillah kaan or subrahmanyam bharti ke dak tikat ko niyamit karavaaya gaya tha
 In March 2015, Prime Minister Modi made a speech in the Parliament of Sri Lanka, read a few lines of Bharti's poem and said that Bharti was a great nationalist poet
 bharti pehle shaks hai jinke bare main zikr miltaa he ki unhone bharat mata kii tasviir se lekar murtiyon banane ke prayaas kiye
 Otherwise, very few people know who was the creator, who was the builder
 ek bada jabardast kissa miltaa he
 In 1911, Mahakavi attempts to make a statue of Bharat Mata made by Bharati Abanindranath
 murtikar kahata he ki is bharat ne kuch gahane hi nahin pahane hai
 So VVS Iyer, a partner of Bharti, says how will jewelry
 videshiyon ne bharat ko lut liya he
 So Bharti replied if the foreigners had also taken Ganga and Yamuna under wraps
 hamaari bharat mata to samraji hai
 Whatever it is, Mother India exists
 ab ham use dekh sakate hai
 If you want, you can make it according to your wish
 bharat mata kii jai ek naaraa ho saktaa he lekin bharat mata ek nahin ho sakati he
 For many people, Bharat Mata is the Bharat Mata who holds the tricolor in her hand
 lekin aresas kii website par jo bharat mata kii tasviir maujuud hai usamen tirangaa nahin he
 In one hand Bharat Maa is blessing and in the other hand there is saffron flag
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se pehle jaan lene main buraai nahin ki kis bharat mata kii jai kahana he
 Those who have the tricolor in their hands have to be cheered or those who do not have the tricolor in their hands
 vaise sangh kii website par jo bharat mata he unke haath main tirangaa kyon nahin he
 The RSS chief has said that everyone has to say Bharat Mata ki Jai
 unhone kaha ki vakt aa gaya he ki nai peedi ko bataanaa hoga ki unhen bharat mata kii jai bolnaa hoga
 But it should come on its own and should be a part of the development of the youth
 bharat mata or vande maataram ko lekar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 There is no need to panic
 raajnneetik dalon kii dikkat yahi he ki ve kabhi is maamle par eemaandaaree se bahes nahin karte, khaskar congress
 In whose session Vande Mataram is sung for the first time, she is nervous as never heard
 bhaajapa bharat mata kii jai kii daavedaari aise karti he ki jab tak aap bologe nahin aap deshbhakt ho hi nahin sakate
 What happened in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is not enough to throw out an MLA, our politics is defeated
 haar is myne main he ki vah thik se khadi hokar mudde ko aapke saamne rakhti nahin he
 After saving eyes, Congress became BJP in this matter
 bharat mata kii jai bolne se kahin zyada dilachasp he bharat mata kii vikaas yatra
 The market too had started saying Bharat Mata as an opportunity
 azaadi se pehle britain or germany se aane vaale saamaanon main bhartiya devi devataaon kii tasveeron or bharat mata kii tasviir kaa bhi istemaal hone laga tha taaki log unhen apana samajhakar kharidne lagen
 In response to Manchester-made foreign clothing, domestic merchants also began to photograph Bharat Mata on their products
 bharat mata or bharat maa ke saath ek jagah hind mata kaa naam bhi miltaa he
 There is a picture of Hindu Mother on this box of matches
 yah tasviir kab kii he isaki jaankaree nahin mil saki magar kya bharat mata hind mata bhi kahi jaati hogi
 Can it still be said bharat kaa naam bharat se hua he
 The name of a man is identified by the country but Bharat Mata is the mother of King Bharata
 iskaa koi pramaan nahin miltaa he
 There is another picture which has a picture of Bharat Mata but it is on a cloth station made in Ahmedabad
 to bharat mata sirf deshbhakti kaa pradarshan nahin he balki inke zariye bhakton kii jeb tak bhi pahunchaa ja saktaa he isaki khoj us vakt ke bazaar ne tabhi kar lee thi
 The comments rahamaan kaa jab vande maataram aayaa tha tab is gane par fishan sho tak hone laga tha
 Actually this is the natural form of patriotism
 ham jab chahen jahaan chahen istemaal kar saken
 In independent India also, the market took a lot of support from Mother India
 ek tasviir main upar likhaa he saare jahaan se acha hindustan hamaara
 a map of India is made in the middle
 nakshe ke bich main bharat mata hai
 Bharat Mata is riding the chariot which is being pulled by a lion
 haath main tirangaa he
 The lion has a halter in one hand
 neeche kinare likhaa he ganatantr diwas kii shubhakamanaayen today chaay
 Below are the daughters-in-law of Ekta Kapoor's popular serial Ki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi

 The diversity of pictures is immense as is the glory of Mother India
 in tasveeron main kabhi bharat mata ko gandhi aashirwad de rahe hai to kabhi gandhi ko bharat mata
 In one picture, Gandhi is in the lap of Mother India
 kai jagahon par gandhi netaji bhi dev rup main badalon ke bich nazar aate hai
 These pictures show that the freedom movement used the available symbols to convey the message to the people
 yah tasviren hi tab ke liye television or twitor ke samaan thim jiske zariye logon ne nehru ko dekha gandhi ko dekha, azaad or bhagat singh ko dekha
 In one picture, Nehru is saluting the tricolor but is not saluting like he usually does
 yahaan par nehru kaa haath chaati ke paas he
 Generally the people of the Union salute in this way
 bharat mata bandhanon se mukt hai
 His both hands are open, breaking the screws
 tasviir ke neeche khadey saare log seene ke paas haath le jaakar salaam kar rahe hai
 i do not want to go into the history of such a salute too much

 Politics is happening about Bharat Mata and Vande Mataram
 isse ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 The problem with political parties is that they never debate this matter honestly, especially the Congress
 jiske adhiveshan main pehali baar vande maataram gaaya gaya ho vah aise ghabraati he jaise kabhi suna na ho
 The BJP claims Bharat Mata Ki Jai in such a way that unless you speak you cannot be a patriot
 maharashtra vidhansabha main jo hua vah ek vidhayak ko baahar kar diya janaa bhar nahin he, hamaari raajnneeti kii haar he
 The defeat is in the sense that she does not stand up properly and put the issue in front of you
 jaise nazaren bachaakar is maamle main congress bhaajapa ho gai
 Bharat Mata Ki Jai is more interesting than speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai

 in tasveeron main kabhi bharat mata ko gandhi aashirwad de rahe hai to kabhi gandhi ko bharat mata
 In one picture, Gandhi is in the lap of Mother India
 kai jagahon par gandhi netaji bhi dev rup main badalon ke bich nazar aate hai
 These pictures show that the freedom movement used the available symbols to convey the message to the people
 yah tasviren hi tab ke liye television or twitor ke samaan thim jiske zariye logon ne nehru ko dekha gandhi ko dekha, azaad or bhagat singh ko dekha

 Generally the people of the Union salute in this way
 bharat mata bandhanon se mukt hai
 His both hands are open, breaking the screws

 Shekhawat said, "indus water treaty" has happened between India and Pakistan, but Pakistan gets huge amount of excess water from India's rivers
 centre sarkaar is par roak lagaaegi, iske liye prakriya bhi shuru kar di gai he
 "good news from Pakistan amid controversy, Kartarpur corridor will open for Sikh devotees from November 9," he said, "A large area is spread across the Ravi River and the rain water that accumulates in the rivers
 Reaches Pakistan via ham is atirikt pani ko pakistan jane se rokenge kyonki is par bhartiya kisaanon or aam logon kaa haq he
 Nobody should have any objection to this move of India

 Telling the truth, what is to happen next: When the Sahitya Akademi conferred the veteran writer and scholar Padma Sachdev with the highest honor of the literary world, 'mahatar membership', these lines of poetry written to him were remembered spontaneously
 is aayojan kii khaas baat yah thi ki sachdev kaa yah sammaan sahitya academy ke adhyaksh or swayan main anuthe kannada lekhak chandrashekhar kambaar ke haathon mila
 Referring to Padma Sachdev's literary contribution in his presidential statement, writer Kambar, who was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi and the Bharatiya Jnanpith, said that Padma Sachdev is not only an excellent poet but he is also an excellent translator
 unka apni maatrubhaasha se prem or usko aage badhaane kaa junun kaabile taareef he
 Our generation is fortunate that we are doing creative work in their time
 mahattar sadsyta praapt karne ke baad apane sweekruti vaktavy main padma sachdev ne kaha ki '‚Äòdesh kii sarvocch sanstha, sahitya academy dwaara mujhe sarvocch sammaan die jane par main gadgad hoon
 Referring to Prabhakar Machwe and Indranath Chaudhuri, former secretary of Sahitya Akademi, he said that both of them connected me to a large family of writers
 apane jivan main dogri lok geeton kii bhoomika kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki inhen ke kareeb jaakar maine chand jodna siikhaa
 He credited prose writing in Hindi to Dharamvir Bharti, editor of the noted litterateur Dharmayuga
 mahattar sadsyta arpan samaaroh ke prarambh main atithiyon evam shrotaaon kaa swaagat karte hue sahitya academy ke sachiv ke shrinivasrav ne kaha ki bharat sahitya or lekhan kii bhoomi he
 Its most important dimension is the contribution of women creators of the country
 unhen is disha main abhi bahut kaary karnaa he phir bhi lambey samay se sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon main mahilaon ke utkrisht yogadan ko bhulaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 Their number may not be high but the content and quality of their writing in all languages is superior to the rest of the writers of the world, whether it is poetry or prose
 apane swaagat bhaashan ke baad unhone padma sachdev ke liye likhaa gaya prashasti patr prastut kiya
 Chandrashekhar Kambar honored Padma Sachdev with a shawl and a copperflake
 arpan samaaroh ke baad samvaad kaarykram ke antargat prakhyat dogri lekhak darshan-darshi kii adhyakshata main indranath chaudhuri, chitra mudgal or mohan singh ne padma sachdev se jude apane srujanaatmak or vyaktigat sambandhon ko saajha kiya
 It is to be known that Padma Sachdev is the eighth writer to receive the greater membership of the Akademi
 apni rachanaaon ke madhyam se, chaahe ve kavitaayen hon, yaa geet hon athwa galp, unhone ekanishtha bhav se dogri saahitiyik paridrishy ko samrudh kiya he
 In addition to the important membership of the Sahitya Akademi to Padma Sachdev, important Hindi writers like Mridula Garg, Mamta Kalia, Nirmala Jain, Chandrakanta, Anamika were also present in the Sahitya Akademi's convenor of the northern languages
 kaarykram se pehle padma sachdev par sahitya academy dwaara nirmit ek vruttchitr kaa bhi pradarshan kiya gaya
 Remember that during our times, Padma Sachdev, the great writer of Dogri, was born on 17 April 1940 in Jammu
 1947 main bharat ke vibhaajan kaa shikaar bane sanskrit ke vidwaan profesar jayadev badu kii teen santanon main sabase badi padma ji ne apni shiksha kii shuruyaat pavitra nadi ‚Äòdevka‚Äô ke tat par sthit apane paitruk gaanv purmandal ke praathmik vidhyalay se kii
 Perhaps the glimpse of nature in his writing is therefore present in its entirety
 padma sachdev ke chhandon kii layaaddh sundarataa sanskrit kavy ke saath aapke parichit hone kaa pratyaksh parinaam he
 The rediscovery of Dogri's fascination during the freedom struggle with the rich oratory tradition of folklore and folklore inspired you to serve, write and develop literature and made you excel as a poet
 aaj itane oonche mukaam tak pahunchane ke baad bhi padma ji yah maanati hai ki unki kavita par sabase mahatvapurn prabhaav unke priy duggar pradesh ke madhur lokgeeton se aayaa he
 Padma Sachdev made her national debut in 1969 with her first collection of poems 'meri Kavita Mere Geet'
 vishesh baat yah ki isaki bhoomika hindi ke qaddavar kavi ramdhaari singh ‚Äòdinakar‚Äô ne likhi thi
 The book was eventually awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1971
 khaas baat yah ki padma sachdev dogri bhashaa main likhi apni aatmakathaatmak rachana 'chitt chete' ke liye saraswati sammaan se bhi sammanit ho chuki hai
 The pane of this book of 662 pages is very detailed
 unki yah kriti kai pradeshik, rashtriya evam antarrashtriya ghatnaon ko bhi samete hue he
 This autobiographical composition of Padma Sachdev begins with his childhood spent in his home state of Jammu and Kashmir and later becomes a story of the struggle to save his culture and identity in the catastrophe of metros like Delhi and Mumbai
 jammu-kashmir cultural academy, soviet land nehru puraskaar se sammanit dogri bhashaa kii is prakhyat lekhika evam kavyitri ne jammu-kashmir radio main staff kalakaar ke taur par kaary kiya or baad main dilli radio par dogri samachar vaachak ke pad par bhi kaary kiya
 He was also honored with the 'rob of Honor' honor by the Academy of Art Culture and Languages of Jammu and Kashmir
 unhen andhra pradesh kaa joshua puraskaar or sahitya academy kaa pratishthit anuwaad puraskaar bhi mil chukaa he
 She was also honored with Dogra Award in the year 2002, among the major works of Padma Sachdev awarded with Kabir Samman of the Madhya Pradesh Government and Padma Shri - Uttar Baihani, Tainthian, Tavi Te Chanahan, Akkhar Kund, Nehariyan Galiyan (andheri Gali), Pota Pota Nimble, laladis, suggi, chitta chetas, words mixed, diwanakhana, mittavaghar, amrai, godbhari, bu tu razi Programming is ever town, deviate not rushing, and Barhdri
 unki aatmakatha boond baavdi bhi kaaphi charchit rahi
 Heartfelt congratulations on this honor with these last lines of the song written to Padma Sachdev, the temples are open, the heart is open, the inside is full of inner peace, there is a crown on the seat, it has given shelter to all; it has never done it Samata Boiage - What is to happen next

 Earlier on May 16, Income Tax raided 22 locations of Lalu Prasad Yadav

 The Income Tax Department conducted raids in the areas of Delhi, Gurgaon, during which the properties worth about 1000 crores were raided
 jaane lalu-rabari-tejasvi par kya hai aropashuukravaar ko sibiai ne lalu yadav, rabari devi or tejasvi ke yahaan chhapemari kii
 While Lalu's railway minister, the CBI raided the FIR on charges of financial irregularities
 sibiai ne is maamle main bhrashtachar kaa nayaa cese darj karte hue patna main circular road sthit rabari devi ke awaas sahit patna, ranchi, gurugram or bhubaneshwar main 12 jagahon par chhapemari kii
 The allegations against Lalu have their roots since 2001
 jo tatkaaleen endie sarkaar ke us faisle tak jaati hai jab usne railway ke hotalon kii cataring sevaaon kaa prabandhan iarsitisi ko saunpane kaa faisla kiya tha
 The Railway Board decided in 2001 that the catering service and the Hotel BNR of the railways located at Ranchi and Puri would be transferred from the Indian Railways to the IRCTC
 iske thik baad jab 2004 main lalu railmantri bane, to unhone sujatha hotels ke malik harsh or vinay kochar, lalu yadav ke kareebi pisi gupta kii patni sarala gupta or iarsitisi ke adhikariyon ke saath milakar kathith taur par aapraadhik sajeesh rachi
 These people made a complete plan to get the rights to the hotels under the conspiracy and many works were done simultaneously
 sibiai ke mutabik, isi sajeesh ke tahat vinay kochar ne 25 farvari, 2005 ko patna main teen acre kii prime land mahaj 1
 Sold Delight Marketing for Rs 47 crore, much lower than the circle rate
 praathmiki main kaha gaya he ki is company kaa malikana haq premchand gupta kii patni sarala gupta ke paas tha, lekin hakeekat main yah lalu yadav kii hi benami company thidhishchhthchh ke tender main bhi hui gadabadisibiai kaa aarope he ki is saude ke din hi railway board ne bnar hotel iarsitisi ko saunpane kaa elaan kiya or phir donon hotalon kaa prabandhan kochar bandhuon kii company ko saunp diya gaya
 The tender which was withdrawn for this was also wrong and there was a conspiracy
 sibiai ke mutabik, is maamle main iarsitisi ke tatkaaleen prabandh nideshak pike goyal ne bhi kathith rup se dhaandhlee kii thi
 The Central Investigation Agency alleges that the terms of the tender were altered to make Sujata Hotel the sole claimant for the tender
 yahaan donon hotalon ke liye 15 se zyada tender dastavej hasil kiye gaye, lekin sujatha hotel ke alaava kisi duusari company kaa koi record nahin he
 According to the CBI, Lalu supervised the tender process as the railway minister
 sibiai ne daawa kiya ki saal 2010 or 2014 ke bich dilite marketing kaa malikana haq bhi sarala gupta se lara projects ke haathon main chalaa gaya, jiskaa swaamitv rabari devi or tejasvi yadav ke paas he
 The FIR states that Lalu was not the railway minister at the time of the deal
 vahiin patna kii us jameen kii keemat bhi tab tak cirkil rate ke anusaar badhkar 32
 5 crores
 sibiai kaa aarope he ki pisi gupta ke parivaar ke sadasyon ne 32

 Gift of one crore to Hema Yadav! Questions have been raised about the gift of crores on Lalu family
 is bare main bijepi ke netaa susheel modi ne kai aarope lagaae
 Lalu Prasad Yadav's wife and daughter Hema Yadav donated land worth about Rs 1 crore in 2014 by his servant Lalan Chaudhary

 jis samay tejpratap ko jameen daan kii gai thi, us samay unki umr mahaj teen saal aath maheene thi
 The 2 plots situated in Kishanpur Marvan in Muzaffarpur occupy a total of 13 acres

 99 saal ke liye iskaa kiraaya 1250 rupee maheenaa tay kiya gaya
 Similarly, Raghunath Jha was also made a minister only when he gifted 6 kattas 18 dhur of land with a three-storey house in Gopalganj to the names of both sons of Lalu Prasad
 inke alaava rajd netaa prabhunath yadav, sudhaa shrivastav, abdulbaari siddiki tathaa badshaah prasad aaazaad ne oune-paune daam par jameen uphaar ke rup main diya tha
 Tejashwi and Tejapratap received gifts from uncle and maternal grandfather According to the allegations, Tejashwi and Tejapratap Yadav got a gift from their uncle Prabhunath Yadav, including a two-storey paved house in Patna
 isaki keemat us vakt kareeb 6 lakh rupee lagaai gai thi

 Biplab Deb says that those who are of narrow mindset, are not convinced of this
 ye log apane hi desh ko kam aank rahe hai
 Biplab said that one has to accept the truth, do not confuse yourself and do not do others
 aakhir kya kaha tha
 
 
 Let us tell you that during an event on Tuesday, Biplab Deb claimed to use internet in Mahabharata
 guwahati main unhone bayaan diya ki 'bharat yugon se internet kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 In the Mahabharata, Sanjay, despite being blind, told Dhritarashtra the condition of the battlefield

 The rape incident in Delhi has raised the issue of safety in taxis
 is ghatana main ubar kii taxi kaa istemaal hua or company ke ravaiye ko dekhte hue daawa kiya gaya ki ubar kii sarvice bain kar di gai he, kam se kam dilli-ensiaar ke bare main to yahi kaha gaya
 The Transport Department, who came in a sudden act, released the list and made it clear that only six companies' taxis are allowed to walk on the streets of Delhi
 so, 9 disambar kii raat lagbhag nau-sava nau baje is daawey kii sachai jaanane nikle hamaare samvaadadaata aditi rajput or mihir gautam
 
 
 First of all, tell us that unlike other companies, there is nothing on Uber taxis so that you can recognize that it is Uber's taxi
 duusari companiyon kii taxi kii tarah company kaa naam nahin likhaa hota he
 When we wanted to make the first booking, the driver said, it is forbidden to run for two days, so i will not come
 hamen laga, bain ke daawey sachche hai, lekin duusari hi koshish main sarkari daavon kii hawa nikal gai
 The driver was only 15 minutes away, confirmed on the phone that he was arriving soon
 ham offis ke baahar khadey intazaar kar rahe the, or lo, gaadi vakt se pehle hi aa gai
 We asked the driver, we want to shoot, no problem
 uske 'nahin' kehane ke baad ham taxi main baithkar lajpat nagar kii taraf nikal pade
 Talked with the driver all the way
 uske mutabik, is khabar ke baad usne company ko phone kiya tha, to company ne kaha ki chalaanaa chaahate ho to chalaao, nahin chalaanaa chaahate to na chalaao
 
 
 However there is no problem
 
 
 driver kii maane to company ne use kabhi nahin bataaya ki ubar par dilli main roak lagi hui he
 According to the driver, no character certificate was also sought while joining the job, but yes, he did give a driving license
 yah poochne par ki kya kabhi company (ubar) ke offis jate hai, uskaa kahana tha, kabhi zarurat hi nahin padi, na unhone kabhi bulaayaa
 By the way, the vehicle we were roaming in did not have GPS, but Uber was the phone of the company
 phone par vah lokation bhi aa rahaa tha, jahaan ham ja rahe the, lekin sochane vaali baat yah he ki agar phone band ho jaae to
 
 
 The driver did not even answer this question
 
 
 sari baaten ek taraf, ab jo sabase bada sawaal saamne he, vah yah he ki jis company kii sarvice band hone kaa daawa na sirf satta main baithe log kar rahe hai, balki dilli police ne bhi kiya, us company kaa mobile ap lagaataar booking le rahaa he, taxi sarvice lagaataar chal rahi he, or logon ko bill bhi bheje ja rahe hai
 
 
 Then what is the prohibition? 
 
 ise to dikhaave ke liye lagaai gai roak bhi nahin kah sakate
 
 
 The government has to understand that if it is really serious then the rules should be tightened
 
 
 jo companiyaan niyam nahin maanatin, unhen baahar kar de, chaahe ve multinational hon yaa hindustani

 maovadi sansadeey loktantr ko 'boarbada' bataate hai or maujuuda samay main bahut se log unase sahamat dikhte hai
 Communist Party of india-maoist (cpi-maoist) spokesperson and now the late Cherukuri prince alias Azad used to say, "indian states are a joint dictatorship of the big bourgeoisie and big landowners, which nurtures imperialism
" yah samaaj ke mutthi bhar oonche varg ke logon ke loktantric hiton kii raksha ko sunishchit karata he, jabaki iske tahat aam bhartiya janata ke ek bade varg par taanaashaahee chalaai jaati he
 According to him, this system cannot be reformed and should be 'overthrown' by revolutionary violence and replaced with 'mass democracy' under the rule of the Maoists
 kai maovadi ghoshnaaon ke mutabik is avadharana ke tahat 'kranti kaa mukhya lakshya lambey jan-yuddh ke baad varsh 2050 tak raajnneetik satta par kabja karnaa he
 'the real danger in India is not that they will seize power, (which they keep dreaming of) but rather that they can promote heavy violence
 apane khilaaf or ek vishaal jansankhya ke khilaaf , jo bahut kam ruchi yaa bhagidaari hone ke baavjood is takaraav main pis rahi he
 The real problem of his theory is not that he is wrong about the inequality or injustice done by the Indian government, but that his proposed 'solution' is utopian (impractical), impossible as it is and truly unproductive
 maovadiyon kii shikayaton ke lihaaj se dekhen to shashan kii nishthurataa evam kuch had tak barbarta, iske abhijatya varg kaa bikaoupan or jansankhya ke bade hisse kii garibi or abhaav har taraf dekha ja saktaa he
 See the history of previous revolutions (marxist-leninist or Maoist), they did not create any new independence, but only a new kind of autocracy came out
 maovadi apni hinsa ko yah kahkar nyyochit tehraate hai ki ve rajya or 'vyavastha' kii hinsa (sakriy or vyavasthit) ke pratikaar main aisa karte hai
 Azad argued, "people do not have to face the violence of the state alone
" bharat jaise virgon main bante samaaj main hinsa vyavastha kii jad main hi hoti he or damit jansankhya ko rosemara jivan main har jagah iskaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Actually, the issue is not about the violence of the Maoists, but also of justice, which erupted after the violence of the oppressors
 yadi naksaliyon kii hinsa par baat kii jaati he to yah baat hamaari vyavastha ke har kone main maujuud hinsa ke pariprekshya main hi honi chahie
 These claims, wrapped in the syrup of the language of class struggle, fall before the truth of the Maoist movement
 zyada dhyaan maovadiyon or unke mukhauta sanghathanon kii kuch badi karravaayiyon kii taraf hi jaataa he jaise pramukh audyogic pariyojnaon ko thap kar dena aadi
 But the truth is that in their dominated areas, they have created such a friendly reconciliation with large enterprises, in which many entrepreneurs accept that Maoists' colorism is' cheaper 'than government corruption
 unhone kai 'damankaaree' samoohon ke saath avasarwaadi gathjod kiye hai
 Sometimes for some strategic reasons, sometimes only for economic benefits
 sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki kuch apwaadon ko chhodkar unhone maujuuda raajnneetik samikarnon ko bigaadane kaa prayaas bahut kam kiya he yaa rajya kii satta ke centre or 'sarkari daman' ke mukhya strot raajnneetik karypalika ko bade paimaane par nishaanaa nahin banaaya he
 Worse, a large part of the thousands of Maoist victims of violence come from the same class or community to which they claim 'liberation' - the poor, the Adivasis and the Dalits
 aisi hatya ko 'bhediyon', 'gaddaaron', 'varg shatruon' kii hatya aadi kahkar nyyochit tehraaya jaataa he, lekin sachai yahi he ki ye hatya aalochana se pare nahin ho saktin
 Says Brian Crozier, "where the revolutionaries consider it more necessary to kill the people on their side than the enemies, it should be understood that there is either widespread opposition to their movement or at least a large part of the population
" Does not agree with them ''ise bhartiya rajya kii vifaltaa hi mana jayega ki is tarah ke antarvirodhon se bharaa ek andolan chal rahaa he or itane lambey samay se chal rahaa he
 About this movement, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself says, "this is the biggest challenge to the internal security of our country
" ''lekin desh ke ek bade ilaake main pasri prashasnic evam raajnneetik shoonyata se vahaan maovadiyon ko panpane ke liye urvar jameen mili he
 Governments in these areas have consistently and consistently failed to provide minimum public goods and services, including protection of life and property, justice and punishment of crimes and opportunities for social and economic progress
 aisi paristhitiyon main yah to hona hi tha ki duusare tatv aakar is khaali jagah ko bharte
 It was also unavoidable that they should not be bound by law or any established procedure in making contact with the local public and because of which such contacts were unacceptably violent
 sarkaron ke dhulmul ravaiye se bhi maovadiyon ko kaaphi sahaayta mili he
 The attitude of governments is sometimes apologetic, sometimes it is beyond comprehension
 udhaaharan ke liye grih mantralay ke baar-baar dohraye jane vaale is daawey ko hi dekhen ki pichley varshon main maovadiyon dwaara kathith rup se 'mukt' karaae gaye 40,000 varg kimi
 10,000 km ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Æ‡•Ä of terrain
 ko sarkari suraksha balon ne 'phir se hasil' kar liya he
 It is not clear which areas of India were 'liberated' or indeed whether the officials who speak so liberally about 'liberated areas' even know what it means
 lekin aise samay main kuch 'safalataa' dikhaane ke liye is tarah ke anumaanon ko pesh karne kii jarurat padati he, jabaki april 2010 ke chintalnad narsanhaar jaise kai opareshnon kii lagaataar vifaltaa ne centre sarkaar ke 'vishaal or samanvit abhiyaanon', ilaakon ko khaali karaane, un par pakad banaae rakhane or viksit karne kii uski 'ranneeti' kii aakshamata ko pradarshit kiya he
 It will be important to clarify here that 'free zone' is part of the Maoist dictionary
 ek mukt kshetra tab sthapit hota he, jab shatru kaa puri tarah naash kar diya jaataa he or krantikari jan sarkaar kaa shashan sthapit kiya jaataa he
 When the Maoists acquire a regular army-like characteristic and drag government forces into battle at some place or a fixed place, and when the Maoist party establishes its system of production
 'mukt kshetra' ve ilaake hote hai, jahaan sarkaar kii kisi bhi tarah kii maujuudagi sambhav nahin hoti
 Any kind of interference in a defined 'line of Control' is faced with conventional military resistance (not just guerrilla action)
 udhaaharan ke liye srilanka main littey ne lambey samay tak uttari srilanka main ek 'mukt kshetra' bana rakhaa tha, jahaan unka apana vyapak shashan chalata tha or ve ek 'agrim raksha pankti' ke dwaara apane ilaake kii raksha karte the
 There is no such area under the control of the Maoists in India
 yahaan par sirf kuch gorilla yaa unke aadhaar vaale ilaake hai
 It is ridiculous to think that with a maximum of 20,000 armed cadres and a 'jan Sena' of around 50,000, one can maintain the 'free zone' in India, but many people sitting in the highest positions in the government also appear to be doing such things
 bharat main koi mukt kshetra nahin he
 There are areas of misrule or misrule under which thugs, gangs, ethnic extremists, Islamic extremists or Maoists run their rule in different parts of the country
 yahaan yadi sabase badtar kuch sthapit kiya ja sakaa he to vah bas 'ashaant prabhutv' he, jisamen hinsa ke sahare sarkari agenciyon ko apane prashasnic daayitv yaa saarvajinak vastuon kii aapurti se roka jaataa he
 The Maoist movement in India has reached a state of low-death stalemate from heavy deadlock
 sashastr balon kii baari maujuudagi vaale 'kshetra par prabhutv' vaali kavayad ke shor-sharabe se kaaphi dur
 However, the quiet, intelligence-based campaign has severely damaged the party leadership and they have had to back down from their efforts to 'spread the mass war across the country'
 ve phir se tathakthith 'red coridor' ke 'kendriya ilaakon tak simat gaye hai
 But if the government's strategy and attitude in dealing with such restless rebellion is not more clear and focused, then such relief will be temporary

 Sanjarpur of Azamgarh is a village in UP where the residents of the last several years are almost tired of answering doubtful questions
 magar sawaal hai ki unka peechha chhodane ko taiyaar hi nahin
 And the effect of these questions has been that wherever the residents here go, there are two or four people who are in doubt, marginalized or lost opportunities by mentioning the name of the area
 darasal, kuch saal pehle is gaanv par 'aatank kii factory' or azamgarh par 'aatank kaa garh' hone kaa jo tag laga he wo abtak chhot nahin paaya he
 Whenever there is a terrorist incident, there is a strange movement in this village, a fear prevails, old wounds are green and a sad feeling is felt

 Actually, John Abraham's film Batla House is releasing on Independence Day in August
 bottla house kii relies se gaanv ke log pareshaan hai
 The reason for the problem is clear
 bottla house film dilli ke jamiya nagar main hue us charchit encounter par aadhaarit he, jisamen sangerpur ke do ladke mohammad aatif or sajid amin maare gaye the
 The agencies described both as members of the Indian Mujahideen
 2008 main ye encounter dilli main hua tha
 What is in this film? According to the villagers, the questions of terror that emerged after the Batla House encounter changed the mood of the village itself
 jaanch agenciyon ne bottla house se pehle upi main serial kachhari blast (banaras, faijabad or lakhanu) main bhi gaanv kaa conection mana tha
 But the kind of atmosphere created after Batla House gave this village the tag of factory of terror
 bottla house ke jin kaa rahasy to aaj tak nahin sulajhaa, magar isane gaanv kaa sukun puri tarah se barbaad kar diya he
 Now people are once again seen in this 'jin' film
 film main encounter oparation main shaamil ek officer kii kahani ko dikhaaya gaya he
 John Abraham plays the lead role
 yahaan ke logon kaa kahana he film ke aane ke baad is gaanv ko lekar deshbhar main vaisaa hi maahaul banegaa, jaisaa pichley kuch saalon main hamane dekha or jhela he

 "why is the protest happening? Like the villagers and some social activists here, like the Batla House encounter, John Abraham's film is also fake
 gaanvvaalon kaa kahana he ki is film ke bahaane ek jile, ek gaanv or ek samudaay ko raashtra virdohi sabit karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he

 In such a situation, the release of the film is expected to affect the cases

 Fair justice will be disrupted
 isliye mukademe ke vichaaradhin rahane tak bottla house ko relies nahin hone dena chahie
 "meanwhile, it is also being alleged that the film is unilaterally and completely based on the story of the investigating agencies
" kyonki nirmaataaon ne encounter yaa dhamaakon ke aropiyon or unke parijanon kaa paksh jaanane kaa koi prayaas hi nahin kiya
 Some scenes and dialogue of the trailer are also being objected

 'opened with song
 din kii shuruyaat swami om se hui jo gaurav se kah rahe the ki vah bani ko samajhaayen ki vah unase naaraaz na rahen, unase bani kii nafrat bardaasht nahin hoti
 After this, 'bigg Boss' introduced Storm Task for captivity and luxury budget
 is task ke liye ghar ke garden aria ko kashmir kaa luk diya gaya
 An igloo was created, which the family members had to decorate together
 iske baad tufaan aane par sabhi gharavaalon ko us iglu ke andar janaa tha
 According to the rule, the member who entered the earliest was to be removed from the captaincy race
 task shuru hone se pehle hi swami om ne elaan kar diya ki task jeetne ke liye vah kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai isliye koi bura na maane
 Monalisa was first out of the task, followed by Swami Om Stool
 unhen rokane ke liye gaurav topda iglu ke tunnel par baith gaye
 Later, at the behest of 'bigg Boss', Lopa placed a red circle and asked the family to stay away from Igloo
 tippaniyan Lopamudra got hurt while entering the igloo when the next storm came, for which he blamed Bani
 bani ne kaha ki unhone lopa ko dhakka nahin diya vah unase pehle aa gai thim
 When Bani spoke with you, Lopa said that Bani talks in street print language
 iske baad donon ke bich jamkar ladaai hui
 The two calm down after intervening between Rohan and Manveer
 is round main gaurav task se baahar ho gaye
 Later, when Gaurav brought the omelette for Bani, Om Swami commented on Bani, this Bani warned him not to take his name nor talk about him
 iske baad kaaphi der tak jab tufaan nahin aayaa to gharavaalon ne tay kiya ki iglu se dur jaaenge tab shaayad tufaan aayega
 While going away from Igloo, seeing Lopa and Rohan's slow pace, Manveer commented on this, there was a fierce debate between Rohan and Manveer, both of them calm down after Gaurav and Manu explained

 He said that when Vikrant came to meet him inside the house, his dream of coming with her to the house was fulfilled
 jab vah jab iske baad tisare tufaan main nitibha baahar ho gayi
 After this, Swami sat very close to Om Igloo
 manu or manavir ne tay kiya ki ve swami om ko iglu ke andar jane nahin denge or ve unhen gherkar iglu ke baahar baith gaye
 At 12 o'clock, the people of the house greeted Manu Punjabi on his birthday
 kal ke episod main kya task jeetne ke liye apane kapade utaar denge swami om? The garden area of the house was given the look of Kashmir for this task
 ek iglu banaaya gaya jise gharavaalon ko milakar decorat karnaa tha
 After this, when the storm came, all the families had to go inside that igloo
 niyam ke anusaar sabase baad main ghusane vaale sadsy ko captaini kii res se baahar kiya janaa tha
 Even before the task started, Swami Om declared that he could go to any extent to win the task, so do not feel bad

 To stop them, Gaurav Topra sat on the tunnel of Igloo

 The comments aglaa tufaan aane par iglu ke andar ghuste vakt lopamudra ko chot lagi jiske liye unhone bani ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 Bani said that she did not push Lopa before she came before him

 When she after this, Nitibha was out in the third storm

 Will Swami Om take off his clothes to win the task in tomorrow's episode? supreme court kii ek tippanee se ek baar phir samaan naagarik samhita kaa mudda charchaa main aa gaya he
 The Supreme Court, in a judgment given on Friday, said that no attempt had been made to implement the Uniform Civil Code for all citizens of the country
 jabaki supreme court is sambandh main kai baar kah chukaa he
 a bench of Justices Deepak Gupta and Anirudh said in its judgment that Goa is a shining example of the Indian state in which the Uniform Civil Code is applicable, irrespective of all religions, except for limited rights
 peeth ne ek sampatti vivaad maamle main ye tippaniyan kii
 The Bench stated that the Portuguese Civil Code, 1867, is applicable in the state of Goa, which also governs the rights of inheritance and inheritance
 jabaki bharat main kahin bhi goa ke baahar is tarah kaa kanoon lagu nahin he
 The bench said that it is interesting to note that in part four of the Directive Principles of State Policy, Article 44 of the Constitution, the makers had hoped that the state would strive for uniform civil code across India
 lekin aaj tak is sambandh main koi karrwai nahin kii gai he
 The bench said in its 31-page judgment, 'although the Hindu Acts were codified in the year 1956, even after the encouragement of this court, no attempt has been made to enforce uniform civil code for all citizens of the country'
 
 sheersh adaalat ne is sawaal par bhi gaur kiya ki kya portugali naagarik samhita ko videshi kanoon kaha ja saktaa he
 The bench said that these laws do not apply unless recognized by the Government of India and the Portuguese Civil Code is applicable in Goa due to a law of the Indian Parliament
 peeth ne kaha, 'isliye, portugali kanoon jo bhale hi videshi mul kaa ho, lekin vah bhartiya kanoonon kaa hissaa bana or saar yah he ki yah bhartiya kanoon he
 This is no longer foreign law
 goa bharat kaa kshetra he, goa ke sabhi log bharat ke naagarik hai
 Let us tell you that this comment of the Supreme Court is also important because the Common Government Code is also on the agenda of the BJP government, which has passed the bill on triple talaq
 modi sarkaar ke pichley kaarykaal main is par sabhi kii raay maangane ke liye lau kamishan bhi banaaya gaya tha jisane apni report bhi sarkaar ko saunpi thi
 But due to heavy opposition from the opposition, like three divorces, this government also had to back down
 lekin doosraa kaarykaal aate hi modi sarkaar ne teen talaak bill sansad main paas kara liya kyonki is baar use rajyasabha main kai dalon kaa samarthan mila hua he
 Therefore, it is believed that after this comment of the Supreme Court, the government can consider it once again
 vahiin is mudde par virodh karne waalon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kaaman civil code ke sahare alpsankhyakon par hindu kanoon thopanaa chaahati he
 Every religion and community has different beliefs and beliefs and they have full constitutional right to follow them

 India Today editor Prabhu Chawla spoke to BJP national president Rajnath Singh on the Aaj Tak program Sidhi Baat
 prastut he us baatcheet ke pramukh anshkpradhanmantri manmohan singh ji kal aapke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke upar baari pad gaye
 They said that your leader who is not strong is helpless
 dekhie, manmohan singh ji ke bare main main kuch nahin kahana chahta hum ki ve kaise pradhanmantri hai
 His five-year tenure has been properly understood by the people of this country
 jahaan tak adwani ji kaa prashn he, 55 varshon ke unke rajnatik jivan main bhinn-bhinn dayitvon kaa unhone jis kushalta se nirvaah kiya he, use bhi is desh kii janata ne dekha he
 You are projecting him as a strong leader
 aapkaa naaraa he ki majboot netaa
 There is no single incident in Advani's political life that anyone can say that he is not a strong leader
 aap jo aatankwaadi qandahar lekar gaye, uske liye koun jimmedaar he?main kisi ko jimmedaar nahin tehraana chaanhunga
 Atal ji called a meeting of all political parties
 manmohan singh us samay rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa the, ve bhi us baithak main shaamil the
 With the consent of all these, it was decided that all the passengers who have been kidnapped should be rescued in any case
 main baar-baar kah chukaa ki yah faisla apaat sthiti main uthaaya gaya tha, isliye naitikta ke paimaane par ise mapa nahin ja saktaa
 On the way he dislikes Advani ji
 
 
 kaha ki paanch saal kii unki koi uplabdhi nahin rahi
 The parties with which the UPA was formed, today they are divorcing the Congress
 bhaajapa kii rajg se kai partiyaan jud rahi hai
 The Congress stands alone on the political plane today
 dow
 Manmohan Singh ji had a question that Advani should be the Home Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, tell him one of his achievements
 akshardham par, sansad par hamalaa hua
 Dr
 manmohan singh ji yah bhul jate hai ki chaahe sansad par hamalaa hua, chaahe akshardham par, chaahe jammu par, lekin us samay hamaare suraksha balon ke javaanon kaa manobal itnaa ooncha tha ki ek bhi aatankwaadi unke nishane se batch ke nahin ja paata tha
 The effective steps that this government should take to fight the menace of terrorism could not be taken
 mumbai cond ke baad kya ek kadam aap bataa sakate hai jis aadhaar par kaha ja sake ki is sarkaar ne aatankwaad ko ek chunauti ke rup main sweekaar kiya he
 You said that the UPA is disintegrating, but what are you assembled? You left the BJD chief and ran away, not even ready to talk to you
 bijd urisa ke 21 loksabhaa kshetron tak simit he
 It is believed that the BJD, which had influence in these areas, broke away from the NDA
 lekin 49 sansadeey kshetron tak prabhaav rakhane vaali partiyon areldi, ieldy, assam gana parishad ne rajg se rishta joda
 With whom you agree - what is the difference between JDS, Deve Gowda and Rajnath Singh, Advani's philosophy? Just opportunism
 satta main baithna he
 Coalition politics has become a necessity today
 hamane kisi ko dhokhaa nahin diya he
 We can cheat, not cheat
 kshetreey dalon ke chote-chote netaa dhul chatva rahe hai
 You tried in Andhra Pradesh, nobody talked to your leaders
 tamilnadu main aapane baat kii, kisi ne aapse baat nahin kii
 These small leaders make them nationals
 baat sabake saath hoti he
 An alliance can happen to anyone, it cannot happen to anyone

 Leaders are ready to do anything to come to power

 After that there was a demand that his candidature be canceled

 aise samay jab emes dhoni (MS Dhoni) balle (strike rate ke maamle main) se apane kamjor pradarshan se aalochakon ke nishane par hai, mukhya chayankarta emesake prasad (MSK Prasad) ke ek bayaan main team india ke is purv captain par dabaav or badha diya he
 Chief selector MSK Prasad has said that Rishabh Pant (rishabh Pant) is poised to become the champion cricketer and he is included in the Indian team's plan for the World Cup 2019 to be held in England this year
 prasad ne haalanki emes dhoni (MS Dhoni) ke bare main sidhe taur par koi baat nahin kahi he lekin unka yah bayaan ek tarah se is baat kaa sanket he ki pant ko worldcup 2019 kii bhartiya team main wicketiper ballebaaj kii haisiyat se sthaan mil saktaa he
 In such a situation, the place of Dhoni (MS Dhoni) who made headlines due to poor performance in batting can be threatened
 jab mahendra singh dhoni ke phans ne jamkar udayi rishabh pant kii khilli
 
 
 Dhoni (MS Dhoni) has been criticized for not being able to rapidly rotate the strike in short format cricket
 shuruyaat ke kuch ran banane main ve kaaphi zyada genden le lete hai iske kaaran aage ke ballebaajon par dabaav bad jaataa he
 The 37-year-old Dhoni (MS Dhoni), who retired from Test cricket, was once identified as one of the finest 'finishers' in short-form cricket, but now he is seen as a shadow of his performance
 australia ke khilaaf teen vanade maichon kii siries ke pehle mukaable main haalanki dhoni (MS Dhoni) ne mushkil paristhitiyon main 51 ran kii pari kheli lekin is dauraan unhone 96 genden khel daaleen
 His strike rate is 53
 13 kaa rahaa jo shorter formet ke cricket ke lihaaj se acha nahin mana jaataa
 Although those who supported Dhoni believe that it was the need of the hour to play on the wicket after three wickets fell in the Sydney ODI, but critics say that Dhoni did not score fast even after being set on the wicket
 iske kaaran vaanchit ran rate lagaataar badhata gaya or score badhaane kii puri jimmedaari rohit sharma par aa gai
 Virat Kohli revealed, because of this MS Dhoni did not get a place in the T20 team, MSK Prasad believes that due to the ability to adapt himself to different formats of the game, Rishabh Pant World Cup The Indian team's plans for the 2019 campaign are included
 australia or newjiland ke khilaaf vanade siries ke liye aaraam diye jane ke baad england jane vaali team main uske sthaan ko lekar atakalein lagane lagi hai
 Prasad said in an interview to PTI, 'pant (rishabh Pant) played three T20 and four Test matches in Australia, it affected his body
 use do hafton ke puure aaraam kii jarurat he, uske baad hi ham faisla karenge ki vah england liance ke khilaaf kitne match khelegaa
 It is part of our World Cup plans
 rishabh pant ne kaha, rahul dravid sar se bahut kuch siikhaa, ab dhoni bhai se seekhney kaa milegaa mauka
 
 
 Praising Pant (rishabh Pant), Chief Selector Prasad (MSK Prasad) said, "he (pant) is moving towards becoming a champion cricketer
" usamen is tarah kii kaabiliyat he, jisase vah khud hi puri tarah se waakif nahin he
 Prasad is happy that Rishabh is understanding what the expectations of captain Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri are and the performance in Sydney reflects this
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòravi or viraat ne use match ke halaat kaa sammaan karne ko kaha or usne bilkul vaisaa hi kiya
 He proved that he can adapt himself to the game without any trouble
 jab hamane use test maichon ke liye chunaa tha to visheshgy uski wicketcaping ko lekar sanshay main the lekin england main ek test main 11 kaich or australian siries main out karne ke record se sabit hota he ki chayan samiti kaa paksh sahi rahaa
 ' bharat daure par haar se jujh rahi australian team ke liye ek acchhee khabar ai he
 The team's explosive batsman Aaron Finch can play against Team India in the third ODI in Indore
 bataa den ki vanade siries ke pehle do maichon main finch mansapeshiyon main khinchaav ke kaaran nahin khel paae the
 Australia are desperate for the return of Aaron Finch in the Indore ODI as his new opening partner Hilton Cartwright with David Warner is not able to give the team a good start
 aise main finch kii vaapasi se australian opening jodi or majboot ho jaaegi
 If Finch returns to the Australian team, then Hamilton cartwrightco may be out of the playing eleven
 pehle do vanade maichon main hilton carterit kaa pradarshan behad kharaab rahaa he
 Cartwright has scored 2 runs in two odis
 aaron finch ne shanivaar ko indore vanade se pehle nets par abhyaas bhi kiya
 Finch partner David Warner also hoped that Finch would be fit to start the innings with him on Sunday
 warner ne kaha, aap sabhi jaanate hai kiaron finchakis tarah kaa ballebaaj hai
 He is a great player
 finch kii maujuudagi se top order main aakraamakata bani rahati he
 It was nice to see him practicing hard to make a comeback
 ummid he ki vah kal ke match ke liye feet ho jayega
 It is about those days when i was undergoing clinical psychologist training
 hafte main chah din clinics main alag-alag maansik rogiyon kii cese study likhnaa or clinics main counselling karne ke baad apane anubhav senior psychologist ke saath saajha karnaa, kul milakar dusron kii dimagi uljhan samajhnaa hi hamaara kaam hota tha
 i met mental patients one after the other (these were mostly neurotic, ie mental illness that did not reach a serious level)
 is dauraan depressant, anggity, phobia, obsesive compalshan (osidi) se jujh rahe logon se meraa kuch zyada hi paala padaa
 One thing that i saw common in all these case studies was that all these people had a terrible disease to enter the minds of others
 aisi nahin ki manorog kaa yahi ek kaaran tha
 But this was an important reason
 ek vivaahit mahila ko dikkat thi ki uski sasuraal vaale uske bare main na jane kya-kya sochate hai
 While she lived in another city
 lekin use yahi chintaa khaae jaati ki uski saas ko to lagata he vah akele rahakar maje lut rahi
 Maybe the in-law side has taunted it
 lekin uske baad us mahila ne bas soch liya ki uske sasuraal waalon ke paas sivaae yah sochane ke doosraa koi kaam he hi nahin
 a 24-year-old girl who was preparing for medical care, after two attempts failed, she would think that people would say that she was stuck in the book all day but it did not happen anywhere
 ek ladkaa jo apni premika ko isliye nahin chhod rahaa tha ki ab paanch saal kaa sambandh ho chukaa he chodenge to dost kya kahenge jabaki vah donon ek duusare se puri tarah ukta chuke the
 His choice or choice was completely different
 maine har cese study behad baariki se padhi phir apane senior psychologist se charchaa kii
 He said, you caught perfectly right
 darasal 70 fisadi manorogon kii vajah hi dusron ke dimag main ghusane kii aadat he
 What will People Say? Will people say the same? Who knows if i am so? People often do what people want from them
 vah nahin karte jo unhen khud se chahie
 Listening to their own mind, they stop listening to their mind and brain
 apni kshamtaaon, apni chaahaton ko darkinar kar nikal padate hai puri duniya kii ummiido par khare utarane, kyonki sabaki ummiido par khare utarana sambhav hi nahin to bas kai tarah ke manorog paal lete hai
 While the solution is absolutely straightforward and simple
 aise log darasal, dusron kii duniya main itnaa ghuse hote hai ki khud se bekhbar ho jate hai
 They have no time to know what is going on in their private world
 cognetive thirapy (yani vichaaron ko karact karne kaa prayaas), family thirapy, autosajeshan, diary riting na jane kya in par aajamaaya jaataa lekin kuch din thik rahane ke baad phir yah ghus jate dusron ke dimag kii saiyr main
 In 2016, i got a book
 maine use padhaa to laga manovaigyanik catholin smith bilkul usee tarah is samasya ko dekh rahi hai jaise maine mahasoos kiya tha
 But i did not have samadha
 smith ne baqayda ek ruparekha banaakar aise logon ke saamne samaadhaan pesh kiya
 Famous psychologist Kathleen Smith in her book (everything Isn't Terrible: Conquer Your Insecurities, Interrupt Your Anxiety, and Finally Calm Down) considers the mind-boggling habit extremely dangerous
 ve sujhaati hai
 
 
 In such a situation what should we do and what not? So


 what to do? - Some people will say that it is the job of the people
 
 
 to kehane den-dusron ne aapako taana diya or phir ve vyast ho gaye duusare shikaar kii talash main or aap byast ho gaye puure din us mune taane ke revijan main
 Avoid his revision - you understand your abilities and the obstacles that come in the way of them
 doosraa vyakti aapako us isburg kii tarah hi dekh paata he, jiskaa 10 fisad upar or 90 fisad neeche rahata he
 Listen to the evaluation of others, hear condemnation but also test yourself
 -bos aakhir mere bare main sochataa kya he? usne mere namaskara kaa jawaab nahin diya
 He is definitely upset with me
 bajaae yah sochane ke apane kaam par dhyaan den
 Yes there may be times that there is really some propaganda going on about you
 aap use sunen or ek lambii saans len
 Then get busy with your work again
 -apane dimag ko shant kar uske bheetar jhanke or duusare kya soch rahe hai ke kachare ko roj kaa roj sone se pehle saaf karen
 What not to do - I'll prove myself - i will prove Myself
 
 
 syndrome mat paaliye
 Proof but for yourself
 unke liye jo aapako vaaki seedhiyaan chadhataa dekhnaa chaahate hai
 - Do not maintain superhero syndrome
 harek kii kshamtaayen alag hoti hai
 Don't take care of becoming like everyone else
 -dimag main vichaaron kii kheti ke bich dusron ke taanen, khwamakhwaah kii naseehaten, shakon kii fasal na ugane den
 Because this crop is so dangerous that it will destroy your positive thoughts
 - dusron ko khush karne main na lage rahen
