 This is actually a Muslim ban

 samachar patr ke anusaar, ashraf ne kaha, ‘ham soochna tak swatantra pahunch main yakeen karte hai
 The only reason for not removing the ban on youtube is that the content related to blasphemy still exists on it
 aapattijanak saamagree hataane ke baad ham jald se jald ise kholenge
 The government of Pakistan banned youtube on September 17 last year in view of the riots in Pakistan due to the alleged anti-islam film on the website

 2 of the afternoon of 22 July
 52 minute par chandrayan-2 kii lonching hogi15 july ko lonching se thik pehle roak diya gaya tha chandrayan-2cryogenic stage main ho rahi helium licage ko kiya gaya thikbhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (ISRO) ke duusare moon mishan Chandrayaan-2 kii lonching 15 july ko launch se 56
 Stopped 24 minutes ago
 chandrayan-2 ko tadake 2
 The most powerful Bahubali rocket GSLV-MK3 was to be launched at 51 am
 lekin 56
 Countdown stopped 24 minutes ago
 isro pravaktaa biaar guruprasad ne isro kii taraf se bayaan dete hue kaha ki jieselvi-emke3 launch whical (rocket) main khami aane kii vajah se lonching roak di gai he
 The next launch date will be announced soon
 lekin, iske baad isro ke vaigyanikon ne vah khami khoj kar use thik bhi kar diya
 isro's trusted sources have stated that there was pressure leakage in the command gas bottle of the cryogenic stage
 isamen helium bharaa tha
 This works to keep the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen in the cryogenic engine cool
 helium licage kii vajah se mishan ko rokna padaa
 The pressure level of helium was not being formed in the bottle
 yah 330 point se ghatakar 300, phir 280 or ant main 160 tak pahunch gaya tha
 Hence the launch had to be stopped
 chaar din main nahin ho pai lonching, to 3 maheene ke liye tal jayega Chandrayaan-215 july ke baad ab tak kya kiya isro vaigyanikon nevaigyanikon ne sabase pehle bahubali jieselvi-emke3 rocket ke sabhi stage se propalent (eendhan) nikaala
 The plan of ISRO scientists was that the entire GSLV-MK3 would be separated, but there was no need to do so
 sirf us hisse ko nikaalkar thik kar diya he, jisamen khami thi
 ISRO scientists have replaced the helium gas bottle
 saath hi us volve ko bhi thik kiya he, jisase pressure li ho rahaa tha
 What will ISRO scientists do for the next few days from today? After conducting a day-long test on July 18, isro's analysis committee will examine the results of all tests in the evening
 saath hi jieselvi-emke 3 rocket ke un hisson kii clining hogi, jisamen se eendhan nikaala gaya tha
 After this, all the parts of the rocket will be taken to the assembly unit and the assembly will be done again
 phir ise lonchpad-2 par le jaaya jayega
 The rocket will then be refueled a few hours before launch
 yah sambhaavna bhi he ki isro vaigyanik lonching ke baad prithvi ke chaaron taraf chandrayan-2 ke 5 chakkar ko ghataakar 4 kar den
 Although it will cost a bit more fuel
 prithvi kii kaksha main kami karne se aage kii yatra ke liye samay bachegaa
 Now that the distance of the moon has increased slightly, it may also happen that even after reaching the moon, scientists can also reduce the number of trips around the moon
 acha hi hua jo ISRO ne taal di lonching
 
 
 Otherwise Chandrayaan-222 could be lost in space
 It may be on the afternoon of July
 Chandrayaan-2's launching sources have told that ISRO scientists have fixed the helium leakage problem
 kuch test baaki hai jo 18 july tak puure ho jaaenge
 2 on 22 July
 52 baje chandrayan-2 launch kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the journey of India's Moon Mission Chandrayaan-2 will proceed 4 days
 yani pehle chandrayan-2 chand par 6 sitambar ko pahunchane vaala tha lekin 22 ko lonching hogi to yah 11 yaa 12 sitambar ko chand ke dakshini dhruv par pahonchega
 However, there is a possibility of launching by the end of July
 agar is maheene launch nahin hoga to sitambar main lonching kii ja sakati he
 If it is not launched on July 22, then it will be launched in september-october
 If the scientists are unable to launch on July 22 even after doing their best efforts, launching Chandrayaan is not possible in the next few weeks
 kyonki, yah launch windo khatm ho jaaegi
 The next launch window will come in September or October
 launch windo vah upyukt samay hota he jab prithvi se chand kii duuri kam hoti he or prithvi ke chaaron taraf chakkar lagane vaale upgrahon or antariksh ke kachare se takaraane kii sambhaavna behad kam hoti he
 The moon is far away
 
 
 antim samay main Chandrayaan-2 kii lonching taalane ke peeche ye he karansitambar-oktober main kyon kii jaaegi moon mishan kii lonchinglaunch windo kaa faisla isro ke trivendrum sthit spes physics lab karegaa
 The next launch window will be available in September or October
 kyonki is dauraan prithvi se chand kii duuri ausat 3
 It is 61 lakh km
 agar 15 july ko chandrayan-2 kii lonching safal rahati to use kareeb 3
 Had to travel 84 lakh km
 yani kareeb 23 hajaar kimi zyada duuri tay kerani padati
 The central government has taken a strong step against Reliance Industries and imposed a fine of about Rs 6600 crore on it
 reliance industries par yah jurmaana uske keji-di6 gas block se utpaadan main tej giravat aane kii vajah se lagaaya gaya
 The move has deepened the dispute between the Petroleum Ministry and RIL
 petroleum mantralay ne company ko jo notice bheja, kaha gaya he ki company ne production shering contract (piessi) kaa ulanghan kiya he
 The company had intentionally dug fewer wells than it had promised to dig in the approved plan
 gauratlab he ki petroleum evam prakritik gas par sansad kii sthai samiti ne petroleum mantralay va hydrocarbon mahanideshaalay (dijiech) ko gas kshetra par kareeb se najar rakhane kaa suzav diya tha
 For any shortfall in production, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance was also asked to take full account
 naukari series kaa 30waan ank he
 Leaders and young people are face to face
 netaa apana manch chun lete hai or yuvaaon par bhaashan de dete hai, noujvaan jab apana maidan chunata he to unke bich koi netaa nazar nahin aata he
 In this country, man's number has become, but there is no concrete figure of how many jobs are available, how many are done
 isliye golmol kii baat kar netaa golmaal kar jate hai
 Unemployment in India is increasing and unemployment is not being talked about
 chunaav aane vaala he or yuvaaon ko bevakoof banane ke liye elaan kiya ja rahaa he ki teen-chaar lakh bahaali karenge
 It used to be that governments had stopped or reduced jobs, now governments do not have the structure to recruit three to four lakhs
 isliye chaar lakh bahaali kaa elaan pehali khabar to he magar kisi ko pataa nahin ki bahaali kab hogi
 The recruitment that comes out in the railway itself takes an average of 2 to 4 years to complete
 hamane naukari series ke tahat dekha he ki koi pariksha do se teen saal se pehle puri hi nahin hoti
 Everyone is wandered here and there in the middle way
 isliye noujvaan pareshaan he
 How long will he tolerate
 har tarah kaa bhaashan sun chukaa he magar pariksha vyavastha main badlaav dikhaai nahin detaa he
 In the coming months, you will get a lot of headline of four to five lakh recruitment news, but the headline will have disappeared after getting a job
 isliye satark rahen, sawaal ye karen ki kya aap chah maheene ke bheetar bahaali kii prakriya puri karenge to ham tali bajaaenge varna aapse sawaal karenge
 Unemployment is not overcome by headline management, nor is slogan in heaven
 aap naukari series kaa koi bhi episod nikaal kar dekh lijie ndtv
 You will get thirty points of job series on in
 ek hi jagah ek hi saath
 On Tuesday, 20 March, thousands of railway apprentices arrived on the Central Railway line of Mumbai
 saadhe teen ghante tak is trek par awajahi ruk gai
 Due to this, the passengers of Mumbai suffered a lot
 kisi ko roak kar aap apane liye rasta nahin bana sakate isliye acha hota is tarah se rail kii patari par andolan nahin hota
 Do not assume that all of them are from Mumbai or Maharashtra
 is andolan ke punjab, uttar pradesh, bihar or gujarat se bhi noujvaan mumbai gaye the
 On March 12, he wrote a letter to the General Manager of the All India Railway Zone that he wanted the railways to train them to be hired after training as before
 hua yah he ki pichley saal june me railway ne niti banaai ki apane aprintis ke liye 20 pratishat hi seat reserve rahegi, baaki ko khuli pratiyogita kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 The youth want that once the restoration of the apprentices has come down, they have been waiting since the training that the railways will be hired because they have got training, they will start working from the next day
 teen ghante ke baad jab likhit aashwaasan mila ki do dinon baad faisla liya jayega tab inhone dharna samaapt kiya
 The police charged lathi on them and stones also came from their side
 kya yah baat tarksangat nahin he ki railway ne jinhen ek se teen saal kii training di he, training ke liye pratiyogita pariksha se hi inkaa chunaav kiya he, to railway ko inhen kaam bhi dena chahie kyonki inhen training to rail kaa pahiyaa banane kii mili he, ye baahar apni dukaan bhi nahin khol sakate hai
 Do you feel sorry for this? aap jaanate hai ki railway main 2 lakh 20 hazaar pad khaali hai, mantralay ne railway par sansad kii sthai samiti se kaha he ki saare padon ko bharne kaa iraadaa nahin he
 Some positions are being considered outsourced as well
 agar saare pad bhare jane lage to ye 20 hazaar bhi ghante bhar main edjust ho sakate hai
 Our partners Sunil Kumar Singh and Sohit Mishra were covering the Tuesday event
 aisa nahin he ki sarkaar ko inke pradarshan kii jaankaree nahin thi
 On March 12, the Railway Apprentice staged a sit-in in front of the BJP office in Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, and Yeddyurappa also came to meet them
 kaha ki ve rail mantri se baat karenge
 The youth ended the picket on Yeddyurappa's assurance
 magar uske baad kuch nahin hua to ve 19 march se usee shahar main railway ke daaarem ke daftar ke baahar dharne par baith gaye hai
 They claim that more than 2000 youth have joined the dharna
 vaise ve bharat bhar main berojgaar aprintis kii sankhya 20,000 bataate hai
 Most 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 passes are out
 is bich 2016 ke saal main mumbai main 699 or gorakhpur main 45 or nardan railway main 13 aprintins rakhe gaye hai magar baaki berojgaar gum rahe hai
 When Yeddyurappa gave the assurance and these youth gave information to the General Manager of All India Railway Zone, even then their demand was not heard
 darasal noujvaan jab andolan karte hai to sarkarein sochati hai ki inhen koun cover karegaa
 There will be a commotion for two days and then the media will get busy with communal statements of an MP
 zarur in naujavaanon ko rail nahin rokani chahie thi lekin kya inaki baat kisi ko sunani nahin chahie thi? Last August, the Railway Apprentice came to Delhi
 10 agast se 21 agast ke bich jantar mantar par jamaa hue
 There was no money in his pocket
 haalat kharaab ho gai
 Some became ill within the first two-three days
 baad main gurudwara rakabganj kii taraf se inke khaane pine kaa intazaam karaayaa gaya tab jaakar ye andolan par date rahe
 Then i went among them and tried to understand what was the matter
 ye sabhi kaale kapade main aae the taaki media ke kawarej ke hisaab se vijual element bhi ban saken magar koi media nahin aayaa
 Would you, as a citizen, want to keep an account of whether the government listens to their voice when the public raises their voice in front of the government after voting
 agast 2017 se pehle ye janvari 30-31 2017 ko bhi andolan kar chuke the
 They had agitated in December 2016 even before that
 aap hi bataaiye, jis railway se training lee ho, vahi railway naukari na de, or jab sawaal kare to kisi ko fark na pade, kya aisa hona chahie
 When we showed last year, he was not sure that anyone could show in prime time
 aaj sab hamaare sahyogi sunil kumaar singh inase baat karne gaye to noujvaan bhavuk ho gaye
 See how helpless a man becomes if the media goes against society
 aaj kaa godi media janata ke khilaaf ho gaya he
 You know that the Railways has removed about 90,000 recruits this year
 magar aap yah nahin jaanate ki in bhartiyon ko puraa karne kaa dhaancha he bhi yaa nahin or kitne saal main ye bhartiyon puri hongi
 Do you also know that the railway has more than 2 lakh 20 thousand vacancies
 magar railway ne sansad kii sthai samiti se kaha he ki uskaa iraadaa sabhi padon ko bharne kaa nahin he
 The option of outsourcing the remaining positions is being seen
 aaj agar railway sabhi 2 lakh 20 hazaar padon kii bahaali kaa elaan bhi kar de to bhi vah do teen saal se pehle is bharti ko puri nahin kar sakati he
 The Railway Minister says that the policy of keeping 20 percent reserve has been formed after the order of the Supreme Court, but the apprentices say that the Railways have their own policy
 ab is par hamaari koi raay nahin kyonki mere paas tathy nahin hai
 Just a letter
 is vakt bharat main berojgaare, naukari, pariksha pranali kii jarjar haalat ke alaava koi badi khabar nahin he
 If this news is not on the front page, then the youth should stop reading the newspaper
 tivi dekhnaa band kar dena chahie
 Think about what will happen to the students of BR Ambedkar University in Agra, the results have not come, so you cannot apply for the recruitment that has come out
 ve bhi kitna hindu muslim dibet dekhenge
 Throughout the day, there is a call from desperate students from Agra to get our results out
 kya aap chahenge ki aapke bacchon ko bhi yahi sazaa mili or kis baat kii sazaa mili
 We are not able to test a soldier without stealing and rigging
 20 march ko hi rajasthan me sipaahi bhartee pariksha puri tarah nirast kar di gai
 The Rajasthan government on 18 October 2017 had advertised for the recruitment of 5500 soldiers
 saamaanya chaatro ke liye 400, anusuchit jati or janajati ke liye 300 rupye kii fees thi
 After four months, when the examination takes place in March 2018, it gets canceled due to copying
 isi tarah har pariksha nikalne ke vakt hedline banati he, radd hone ke vakt hedline banane ke baad dhire-dhire gaayab ho jaati he
 How much time has been wasted by the youth
 rajasthan patrika ne likhaa he ki 16 lakh abhyarthi prabhavit hone ja rahe hai
 The news has appeared in Bhaskar of 15 March that the Chief Minister has decided that all the recruitment will be completed by December this year
 aap dekhte chaliye kitni bhartee puri hoti he
 When we cannot get 5500 posts reinstated without stealing on time, can 90,000 or 1 lakh posts be restored without three to four years
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkarein hi aisi dheel chhod detii hai ki maamla radd hota rahe, radd na ho to mukademe main fansata rahe
 INLD MP Dushyant Chautala has asked the Labor Minister the question of what is the growth rate of unemployment in the last three years, what was the goal of giving jobs during that time, how much success has been achieved in it
 to jawaab diya gaya he ki sarkaar dwaara koi lakshya nahin rakhaa gaya he
 However, improving employment generation and employability has been a major priority of the government
 is jawaab ke saath bahut sari nitiyaan gina di gayi hai, vahi mudra yojana se lekar skill india tak
 But no data has been given on how many people got employment because of them
 kya sarkaar ke paas bataane laayak aankade nahin hai yaa phir aankade he hi nahin
 This will be known only from the slogan of the next election
 maharashtra ke alag alag shaharon se ye ladke kai baar mumbai kaa chakkar laga chuke hai
 NDTV reached Mumbai's office on 19 March
 phir 20 march ko bhi aae
 These children wanted to come to Delhi and tell their story for prime time but they did not have money to come to Delhi so they went to our office in Mumbai
 kareeb 450 kii sankhya main ye chaatr maharashtra state power janareshan company limited mahajenko main apni niyukti kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 In 2014, 212 posts of deputy executive engineers were advertised, for which 17000 students applied
 500 rupee dekar farm bharaa tha
 Written test was taken on 11 January 2015
 20 march 2015 ko riselt aayaa
 450 people passed
 jab laga ki sarkari naukari mil jaaegi to inhone puraani naukari chhod di
 No one will leave because the government job they got
 lekin ek chaatr ne 4 june 2016 ko cese kar diya
 These students approached the student who made the case, explained to him that the government only goes on a date, the case is not contested and because of you ruining our life, the boy withdrew the case in July 2017
 ab inaki jwining kii sari adchane dur ho gai thi
 But after that it has been more than seven months but they have not joined
 adaalat kaa nirnay inke paksh main hi aayaa he iske baad bhi jwining nahin hui he
 It is a calculation that for seven months, they have been waiting for joining, wandering here and there, you have heard in the world that everything is not joining for seven months after clearing everything
 staff salection kamishan kaa bhi yahi haal he
 Thousands of students still have not received the joining letter after passing the exam in August 2017
 sieji ke sahaayak auditor ke liye hazaar ke kareeb chaatr jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 How can this injustice be tolerated with these children? staff salection kamishan ke baahar chaatr kai baar pareekshaon main dhaandhlee ko lekar bada andolan kar chuke hai
 The report of the Standing Committee of Parliament has also come
 is report main kaha gaya he ki staff salection kamishan par 2,220 court cese hai
 So the question comes that the trial of the case in the court should be done at a fast pace because it is ruining the lives of the youth
 simpal baat he, phir aap jajon kii vekainsee kaa haal sunenge to aaj khaanaa nahin kha paaenge lagegaa hi nahin ki slogan ke alaava kuch ho bhi rahaa he
 The comments sansadeey samiti kii report main kaha gaya he ki das saal main esayssi ke jimme bees guna se adhik chaatro kii pariksha lene kii zimmedaari aa gai he
 About one million students participated in SSC examinations during 2008-09
 2016-17 main esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil chaatro kii sankhya badhkar 2 karod ho gai
 But the number of employees to handle such a large number of students remains the same
 das saal se ayog ke karmchaariyon kii sweekrut padon kii sankhya 481 par hi ataki he
 Of this, 115 posts are vacant at this time i
e
 24 per cent are vacant
 yah ayog apane bheetar karmchaariyon ko samay se nahin bhar paata he
 Twenty million students attend SSC examinations
 iske kaaran do karod chaatro kii zindagi prabhavit hoti he phir bhi iske chaatro kii samasyaon ko media kawarez nahin miltaa tha
 Today you know about SSC due to job series and their own movement, but you see that the government has made all the arrangements to increase unemployment
 agar is par charchaa nahin hogi to yah kaise badalegaa
 When will it change aane vaale maheenon main chaar se paanch lakh bhartee vaali khabaron kii hedline aapako khub milegi magar naukari milte milte hedline gaayab ho chuki hogi
 So be cautious, question whether if you complete the restoration process within six months, we will clap or else you will be questioned
 hedline management se berojgaare dur nahin hoti he na slogan main swarg hota he
 You remove any episode of the job series and watch ndtv
 in par naukari series ke tison ank mil jaaenge
 Same place at the same time
 mangalvaar 20 march ko mumbai ke central railway line par hazaron kii sankhya main railway aprintis aa dhamke
 The movement stopped at this track for three and a half hours
 iske kaaran mumbai ke yatriyon ko kaaphi takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 You cannot make a path for yourself by stopping someone, so it would be good that there is no movement on the rail tracks
 aap ye na samajhen ki ye sabhi mumbai yaa maharashtra ke hai
 The youth from Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat also went to Mumbai for this movement
 12 march ko inhone ol india railway zone ke mahaprabandhak ko patr likhaa tha ki ve chaahate hai ki railway jinhen training detii he unhen pehle kii tarah training ke baad naukari par rakh le
 It has happened that in June last year, the Railways made a policy that only 20 percent seats will be reserved for its apprentices, the rest will have to face open competition
 noujvaan chaahate hai ki ek to aprintins kii bahaali kam ho gai he, ve training ke baad se is intazaar main the ki railway kaam par rakhegi kyonki inhen to training mili hui he, agle din se kaam karne lagenge
 After three hours, when they received written assurance that the decision would be taken after two days, they ended the picket
 police ne in par lathi charge kiya or inaki taraf se bhi pathar chale
 Isn't it logical that the railways, who have been given training for one to three years, have selected them from the competitive examination for training, then the railways should also give them work because they have got training to make the railway wheel , They cannot even open their shop outside
 kya aapako is baat main dam nahin lagata he
 You know that there are 2 lakh 20 thousand vacancies in the Railways, the Ministry has told the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways that there is no intention to fill all the posts
 kuch padon ko outsource kiye jane par bhi vichaar chal rahaa he
 If all the posts are filled then they can be adjusted within 20 thousand hours
 hamaare sahyogi sunil kumaar singh or sohit mishra mangalvaar kii ghatana ko cover kar rahe the
 It is not that the government was not aware of their performance
 12 march ko railway aprintis ne karnataka kii rajdhani bengalooru main bijepi offis ke saamne dharna diya tha or yediurppa bhi inase milane aae the
 Said they will talk to the Railway Minister
 naujavaanon ne yediurppa ke aashwaasan par dharna samaapt kar diya
 But if nothing happens after that, they have sat on a dharna outside the railway's DMM office in the same city since 19 March
 inkaa daawa he ki 2000 se adhik noujvaan vahaan ke dharne main shaamil ho chuke hai
 By the way, they cite 20,000 unemployed apprentices across India
 zyaadaatar 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 ke paas out hai
 Meanwhile, in the year of 2016, 699 in Mumbai and 45 in Gorakhpur and 13 Apprentices have been kept in Northern Railway but the rest are unemployed
 yediurppa ne jab aashwaasan diya or in naujavaanon ne ol india railway zone ke mahaprabandhan ko soochna de di tab bhi inaki maang par sunwaayee nahin hui
 In fact, when the youth agitate, the governments wonder who will cover them
 do din hangaamaa karenge or phir media kisi saansad ke sampradayik bayaan ko lekar vyast ho jayega
 Surely these youth should not have stopped the train but should not anyone have listened to them? pichley agast ye railway aprintis dilli aae the
 Between 10 August and 21 August, Jantar gathered at Mantar
 inaki jeb main paise nahin the
 The condition worsened
 kuch to pehle do teen din main hi biimaar ho gaye
 Later, arrangements were made to drink their food from Gurdwara Rakabganj, then they stayed on the movement
 tabhi main inke bich gaya tha or samajhane kaa prayaas kiya tha ki ye kya maamla he
 All of them came in black clothes so that according to the coverage of the media, a visual element could also be made, but no media came
 kya aap ek naagarik ke taur par iskaa hisaab rakhana chahenge ki vot dene ke baad jab sarkaar ke saamne janata awaz uthaati he to vah sarkaar unki awaz sunati he yaa nahin
 Before August 2017, they had also agitated on January 30-31 2017
 usase bhi pehle disambar 2016 main andolan kar chuke the
 You tell me, the railway from which you have taken training, the same railway should not give a job, and when you ask any question, should it be so
 hamane jab pichley saal dikhaaya tha tab inhen yakeen nahin hua tha ki prime time main koi dikhaa saktaa he
 Today, when our colleague Sunil Kumar Singh went to talk to them, the youth became emotional
 dekhie agar media samaaj ke khilaaf ho jaataa he to aadmi kitna asahaay ho jaataa he
 Today's dock media has turned against the public
 aap jaanate hai ki railway ne is saal kareeb 90,000 bhartiyon nikaali hai
 But you do not know whether there is a structure to fulfill these recruitments or not, and in how many years these recruitments will be completed
 kya aap yah bhi jaanate hai ki railway ke paas 2 lakh 20 hazaar se adhik vekency he
 But the Railways has told the standing committee of Parliament that it is not its intention to fill all the posts
 baaki padon ko outsource yani theke par bhare jane kaa vikalp dekha ja rahaa he
 Today even if the railways announces the reinstatement of all 2 lakh 20 thousand posts, even then it cannot complete this recruitment before two to three years
 rail mantri kehete hai ki 20 pratishat reserve rakhane kii niti supreme court ke aadesh ke baad bani he lekin aprintins kehete hai ki railway kii apni banaai hui niti he
 Now we have no opinion on this because i do not have the facts
 bas ek patr he
 At this time, there is no big news in India except unemployment, jobs, and poor state of examination system
 agar ye khabar pehle panne par nahin he to yuvaaon ko akhbaar padhanaa chhod dena chahie
 Must stop watching TV
 aap sochie agra ke biaar ambedkar uniwarsity ke chaatro par kya biit rahi hogi, riselt nahin aayaa he lihaaza jo bhartee nikali he uske liye applai bhi nahin kar sakate
 They will also see how much Hindu Muslim debate
 din bhar agra se hataash maayoos chaatro kaa phone aa rahaa he ki hamaara riselt nikalava dijie
 Would you like your children to be punished and punished? ham ek sipaahi kaa imtahaan nahin kara paa rahe hai, bina chori or dhaandhlee ke
 On March 20, the Rajasthan Police Recruitment Exam was completely canceled
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 18 oktober 2017 ko 5500 sipaahiyon kii bhartee ke liye vigyaapan nikaala tha
 There was a fee of Rs 400 for general students, Rs 300 for scheduled castes and tribes
 itnaa paisa dekar chaar maheene baad jab march 2018 main imtahaan hota he to vah nakal ke kaaran radd ho jaati he
 Similarly, the headline is made at the time of every exam, and after the cancellation, the headline disappears gradually
 yuvaaon kaa kitna samay barbaad hua he
 Rajasthan Patrika has written that 16 lakh candidates are going to be affected
 15 march ke bhaskar main khabar chhapi he ki mukhyamantri ne tay kiya he ki is saal disbanr tak sari bhartee puri ho jaaegi
 You see how much recruitment is completed
 jab ham 5500 padon par bahaali samay se bina chori ke nahin kara sakate to kya 90,000 yaa 1 lakh padon kii bahaali bina teen chaar saal ke ho sakati he
 At times, it seems that governments leave such laxity that the case is canceled, and if not canceled, then it gets stuck in the case
 ieneldi ke saansad dushyant chautaala ne shram mantri se sawaal poocha he ki pichley teen saal main berojgaare kii vruddhi dar kya he, us dauraan naukari dene kaa kya lakshya tha, usamen kitni safalataa praapt hui he
 So the answer is that no target has been set by the government
 tathaapi, rojgaar srijan evam niyojaneeyata main sudhaar karnaa sarkaar kii pramukh praathamikta rahi he
 Many policies have been counted with this answer, from Mudra Yojana to Skill India
 magar unke kaaran kitnon ko rojgaar mila iskaa koi aankada nahin diya gaya he
 Whether the government does not have figures to tell or it does not have figures at all
 ye to agle chunaav ke slogan se hi pataa chalegaa
 These boys have visited Mumbai many times from different cities of Maharashtra
 19 march ko enditivi mumbai ke daftar pahunch gaye
 Then came also on 20 March
 ye bachche dilli aakar prime time ke liye apni kahani bataanaa chaahate the magar inke paas dilli aane tak ke liye paise nahin the isliye ye mumbai sthit hamaare daftar gaye
 Around 450 students are waiting for their appointment with Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited Mahagenco
 2014 main dipti eczecutive ejeeniyar ke 212 pad kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha, jiske liye 17000 chaatro ne applai kar diya
 The form was filled by giving 500 rupees

 450 log paas hue
 When he felt that he would get a government job, he quit his old job
 koi bhi chhod degaa kyonki sarkari naukari jo mili thi
 But a student filed a case on 4 June 2016
 in chaatro ne cese karne vaale chaatr se sampark kiya, use samajhaayaa ki sarkaar to sirf date lekar chali jaati he, mukadmaa to ladati nahin he or tumhaare chalate hamaara jivan barbaad ho gaya to us ladke ne julai 2017 main cese waapas le liya
 Now all the obstacles of their joining had gone away
 lekin uske baad saat maheene se zyaada samay ho chuke hai magar inaki jwining nahin hui he
 The decision of the court has come in their favor, even after this, there is no joining
 iskaa koi hisaab he ki saat maheene se ye jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai, yahaan vahaan bhatak rahe hai, awwal aapane duniya main kahi suna he ki sab kuch clear ho jane ke baad saat saat maheene tak jwining nahin ho rahi he
 The same is the position of the Staff Selection Commission
 abhi bhi hazaron chaatro ko agast 2017 main pariksha paas karne ke baad jwining letters nahin mila he
 Around a thousand students are waiting for the joining letter for the CAG assistant auditor
 in bacchon ke saath ye ninsaphi bardaasht kaise kii ja sakati he
 Outside the Staff Selection Commission, students have made a big agitation for rigging several times in examinations
 sansad kii sthai samiti kii report bhi ai he
 This report states that there are 2,220 court cases on the Staff Selection Commission
 to sawaal aata he ki court main cese kii sunwaayee tej gati se ho iskaa prayaas hona chahie kyonki isse naujavaanon kii zindagi barbaad ho rahi he
 The simple thing is, then if you listen to the vacancy of the judges, then today you will not be able to eat food, not only that something is happening other than slogan
 tippaniyan The report of the parliamentary committee says that in ten years, the responsibility of SSC has been taken to take the examination of more than twenty times the students
 2008-09 ke dauraan esayssi ke imtahaanon main kareeb das lakh chaatro ne hissaa liya tha
 In 2016-17, the number of students in SSC examinations increased to 2 crore
 lekin itani badi sankhya main chaatro ko sanbhaalane ke liye karmchaariyon kii sankhya jas kii tas he
 For ten years, the number of sanctioned posts of Commission staff has been stuck at 481 only
 isamen se bhi is vakt 115 pad khaali hai yani 24 pratishat pad khaali hai
 This commission does not fill the staff within its time
 do karod chaatr esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil hote hai
 Due to this, the lives of two crore students are affected, but the problems of its students did not get media coverage
 naukari series or inke apane andolan ke kaaran aaj aap esayssi ke bare main jaanate hai magar aap dekhie ki berojgaare badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne hi sara intazaam kiya hua he
 If it is not discussed then how will it change
 kab badalegaa
 On Tuesday, 20 March, thousands of railway apprentices arrived on the Central Railway line of Mumbai
 saadhe teen ghante tak is trek par awajahi ruk gai
 Due to this, the passengers of Mumbai suffered a lot
 kisi ko roak kar aap apane liye rasta nahin bana sakate isliye acha hota is tarah se rail kii patari par andolan nahin hota
 Do not assume that all of them are from Mumbai or Maharashtra
 is andolan ke punjab, uttar pradesh, bihar or gujarat se bhi noujvaan mumbai gaye the
 On March 12, he wrote a letter to the General Manager of the All India Railway Zone that he wanted the railways to train them to be hired after training as before
 hua yah he ki pichley saal june me railway ne niti banaai ki apane aprintis ke liye 20 pratishat hi seat reserve rahegi, baaki ko khuli pratiyogita kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 The youth want that once the restoration of the apprentices has come down, they have been waiting since the training that the railways will be hired because they have got training, they will start working from the next day
 teen ghante ke baad jab likhit aashwaasan mila ki do dinon baad faisla liya jayega tab inhone dharna samaapt kiya
 The police charged lathi on them and stones also came from their side
 kya yah baat tarksangat nahin he ki railway ne jinhen ek se teen saal kii training di he, training ke liye pratiyogita pariksha se hi inkaa chunaav kiya he, to railway ko inhen kaam bhi dena chahie kyonki inhen training to rail kaa pahiyaa banane kii mili he, ye baahar apni dukaan bhi nahin khol sakate hai
 Do you feel sorry for this? aap jaanate hai ki railway main 2 lakh 20 hazaar pad khaali hai, mantralay ne railway par sansad kii sthai samiti se kaha he ki saare padon ko bharne kaa iraadaa nahin he
 Some positions are being considered outsourced as well
 agar saare pad bhare jane lage to ye 20 hazaar bhi ghante bhar main edjust ho sakate hai
 Our partners Sunil Kumar Singh and Sohit Mishra were covering the Tuesday event
 aisa nahin he ki sarkaar ko inke pradarshan kii jaankaree nahin thi
 On March 12, the Railway Apprentice staged a sit-in in front of the BJP office in Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, and Yeddyurappa also came to meet them
 kaha ki ve rail mantri se baat karenge
 The youth ended the picket on Yeddyurappa's assurance
 magar uske baad kuch nahin hua to ve 19 march se usee shahar main railway ke daaarem ke daftar ke baahar dharne par baith gaye hai
 They claim that more than 2000 youth have joined the dharna
 vaise ve bharat bhar main berojgaar aprintis kii sankhya 20,000 bataate hai
 Most 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 passes are out
 is bich 2016 ke saal main mumbai main 699 or gorakhpur main 45 or nardan railway main 13 aprintins rakhe gaye hai magar baaki berojgaar gum rahe hai
 When Yeddyurappa gave the assurance and these youth gave information to the General Manager of All India Railway Zone, even then their demand was not heard
 darasal noujvaan jab andolan karte hai to sarkarein sochati hai ki inhen koun cover karegaa
 There will be a commotion for two days and then the media will get busy with communal statements of an MP
 zarur in naujavaanon ko rail nahin rokani chahie thi lekin kya inaki baat kisi ko sunani nahin chahie thi? Last August, the Railway Apprentice came to Delhi
 10 agast se 21 agast ke bich jantar mantar par jamaa hue
 There was no money in his pocket
 haalat kharaab ho gai
 Some became ill within the first two-three days
 baad main gurudwara rakabganj kii taraf se inke khaane pine kaa intazaam karaayaa gaya tab jaakar ye andolan par date rahe
 Then i went among them and tried to understand what was the matter
 ye sabhi kaale kapade main aae the taaki media ke kawarej ke hisaab se vijual element bhi ban saken magar koi media nahin aayaa
 Would you, as a citizen, want to keep an account of whether the government listens to their voice when the public raises their voice in front of the government after voting
 agast 2017 se pehle ye janvari 30-31 2017 ko bhi andolan kar chuke the
 They had agitated in December 2016 even before that
 aap hi bataaiye, jis railway se training lee ho, vahi railway naukari na de, or jab sawaal kare to kisi ko fark na pade, kya aisa hona chahie
 When we showed last year, he was not sure that anyone could show in prime time
 aaj sab hamaare sahyogi sunil kumaar singh inase baat karne gaye to noujvaan bhavuk ho gaye
 See how helpless a man becomes if the media goes against society
 aaj kaa godi media janata ke khilaaf ho gaya he
 You know that the Railways has removed about 90,000 recruits this year
 magar aap yah nahin jaanate ki in bhartiyon ko puraa karne kaa dhaancha he bhi yaa nahin or kitne saal main ye bhartiyon puri hongi
 Do you also know that the railway has more than 2 lakh 20 thousand vacancies
 magar railway ne sansad kii sthai samiti se kaha he ki uskaa iraadaa sabhi padon ko bharne kaa nahin he
 The option of outsourcing the remaining positions is being seen
 aaj agar railway sabhi 2 lakh 20 hazaar padon kii bahaali kaa elaan bhi kar de to bhi vah do teen saal se pehle is bharti ko puri nahin kar sakati he
 The Railway Minister says that the policy of keeping 20 percent reserve has been formed after the order of the Supreme Court, but the apprentices say that the Railways have their own policy
 ab is par hamaari koi raay nahin kyonki mere paas tathy nahin hai
 Just a letter
 is vakt bharat main berojgaare, naukari, pariksha pranali kii jarjar haalat ke alaava koi badi khabar nahin he
 If this news is not on the front page, then the youth should stop reading the newspaper
 tivi dekhnaa band kar dena chahie
 Think about what will happen to the students of BR Ambedkar University in Agra, the results have not come, so you cannot apply for the recruitment that has come out
 ve bhi kitna hindu muslim dibet dekhenge
 Throughout the day, there is a call from desperate students from Agra to get our results out
 kya aap chahenge ki aapke bacchon ko bhi yahi sazaa mili or kis baat kii sazaa mili
 We are not able to test a soldier without stealing and rigging
 20 march ko hi rajasthan me sipaahi bhartee pariksha puri tarah nirast kar di gai
 The Rajasthan government on 18 October 2017 had advertised for the recruitment of 5500 soldiers
 saamaanya chaatro ke liye 400, anusuchit jati or janajati ke liye 300 rupye kii fees thi
 After four months, when the examination takes place in March 2018, it gets canceled due to copying
 isi tarah har pariksha nikalne ke vakt hedline banati he, radd hone ke vakt hedline banane ke baad dhire-dhire gaayab ho jaati he
 How much time has been wasted by the youth
 rajasthan patrika ne likhaa he ki 16 lakh abhyarthi prabhavit hone ja rahe hai
 The news has appeared in Bhaskar of 15 March that the Chief Minister has decided that all the recruitment will be completed by December this year
 aap dekhte chaliye kitni bhartee puri hoti he
 When we cannot get 5500 posts reinstated without stealing on time, can 90,000 or 1 lakh posts be restored without three to four years
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkarein hi aisi dheel chhod detii hai ki maamla radd hota rahe, radd na ho to mukademe main fansata rahe
 INLD MP Dushyant Chautala has asked the Labor Minister the question of what is the growth rate of unemployment in the last three years, what was the goal of giving jobs during that time, how much success has been achieved in it
 to jawaab diya gaya he ki sarkaar dwaara koi lakshya nahin rakhaa gaya he
 However, improving employment generation and employability has been a major priority of the government
 is jawaab ke saath bahut sari nitiyaan gina di gayi hai, vahi mudra yojana se lekar skill india tak
 But no data has been given on how many people got employment because of them
 kya sarkaar ke paas bataane laayak aankade nahin hai yaa phir aankade he hi nahin
 This will be known only from the slogan of the next election
 maharashtra ke alag alag shaharon se ye ladke kai baar mumbai kaa chakkar laga chuke hai
 NDTV reached Mumbai's office on 19 March
 phir 20 march ko bhi aae
 These children wanted to come to Delhi and tell their story for prime time but they did not have money to come to Delhi so they went to our office in Mumbai
 kareeb 450 kii sankhya main ye chaatr maharashtra state power janareshan company limited mahajenko main apni niyukti kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 In 2014, 212 posts of deputy executive engineers were advertised, for which 17000 students applied
 500 rupee dekar farm bharaa tha
 Written test was taken on 11 January 2015
 20 march 2015 ko riselt aayaa
 450 people passed
 jab laga ki sarkari naukari mil jaaegi to inhone puraani naukari chhod di
 No one will leave because the government job they got
 lekin ek chaatr ne 4 june 2016 ko cese kar diya
 These students approached the student who made the case, explained to him that the government only goes on a date, the case is not contested and because of you ruining our life, the boy withdrew the case in July 2017
 ab inaki jwining kii sari adchane dur ho gai thi
 But after that it has been more than seven months but they have not joined
 adaalat kaa nirnay inke paksh main hi aayaa he iske baad bhi jwining nahin hui he
 It is a calculation that for seven months, they have been waiting for joining, wandering here and there, you have heard in the world that everything is not joining for seven months after clearing everything
 staff salection kamishan kaa bhi yahi haal he
 Thousands of students still have not received the joining letter after passing the exam in August 2017
 sieji ke sahaayak auditor ke liye hazaar ke kareeb chaatr jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 How can this injustice be tolerated with these children? staff salection kamishan ke baahar chaatr kai baar pareekshaon main dhaandhlee ko lekar bada andolan kar chuke hai
 The report of the Standing Committee of Parliament has also come
 is report main kaha gaya he ki staff salection kamishan par 2,220 court cese hai
 So the question comes that the trial of the case in the court should be done at a fast pace because it is ruining the lives of the youth
 simpal baat he, phir aap jajon kii vekainsee kaa haal sunenge to aaj khaanaa nahin kha paaenge lagegaa hi nahin ki slogan ke alaava kuch ho bhi rahaa he
 The comments sansadeey samiti kii report main kaha gaya he ki das saal main esayssi ke jimme bees guna se adhik chaatro kii pariksha lene kii zimmedaari aa gai he
 About one million students participated in SSC examinations during 2008-09
 2016-17 main esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil chaatro kii sankhya badhkar 2 karod ho gai
 But the number of employees to handle such a large number of students remains the same
 das saal se ayog ke karmchaariyon kii sweekrut padon kii sankhya 481 par hi ataki he
 Of this, 115 posts are vacant at this time i
e
 24 per cent are vacant
 yah ayog apane bheetar karmchaariyon ko samay se nahin bhar paata he
 Twenty million students attend SSC examinations
 iske kaaran do karod chaatro kii zindagi prabhavit hoti he phir bhi iske chaatro kii samasyaon ko media kawarez nahin miltaa tha
 Today you know about SSC due to job series and their own movement, but you see that the government has made all the arrangements to increase unemployment
 agar is par charchaa nahin hogi to yah kaise badalegaa
 When will it change kya yah baat tarksangat nahin he ki railway ne jinhen ek se teen saal kii training di he, training ke liye pratiyogita pariksha se hi inkaa chunaav kiya he, to railway ko inhen kaam bhi dena chahie kyonki inhen training to rail kaa pahiyaa banane kii mili he, ye baahar apni dukaan bhi nahin khol sakate hai

 24 per cent are vacant

 Twenty million students attend SSC examinations
 iske kaaran do karod chaatro kii zindagi prabhavit hoti he phir bhi iske chaatro kii samasyaon ko media kawarez nahin miltaa tha
 Today you know about SSC due to job series and their own movement, but you see that the government has made all the arrangements to increase unemployment
 agar is par charchaa nahin hogi to yah kaise badalegaa
 When will it change hamaare sahyogi sunil kumaar singh or sohit mishra mangalvaar kii ghatana ko cover kar rahe the
 It is not that the government was not aware of their performance
 12 march ko railway aprintis ne karnataka kii rajdhani bengalooru main bijepi offis ke saamne dharna diya tha or yediurppa bhi inase milane aae the
 Said they will talk to the Railway Minister
 naujavaanon ne yediurppa ke aashwaasan par dharna samaapt kar diya
 But if nothing happens after that, they have sat on a dharna outside the railway's DMM office in the same city since 19 March
 inkaa daawa he ki 2000 se adhik noujvaan vahaan ke dharne main shaamil ho chuke hai
 By the way, they cite 20,000 unemployed apprentices across India
 zyaadaatar 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 ke paas out hai
 Meanwhile, in the year of 2016, 699 in Mumbai and 45 in Gorakhpur and 13 Apprentices have been kept in Northern Railway but the rest are unemployed
 yediurppa ne jab aashwaasan diya or in naujavaanon ne ol india railway zone ke mahaprabandhan ko soochna de di tab bhi inaki maang par sunwaayee nahin hui
 In fact, when the youth agitate, the governments wonder who will cover them
 do din hangaamaa karenge or phir media kisi saansad ke sampradayik bayaan ko lekar vyast ho jayega
 Surely these youth should not have stopped the train but should not anyone have listened to them? pichley agast ye railway aprintis dilli aae the
 Between 10 August and 21 August, Jantar gathered at Mantar
 inaki jeb main paise nahin the
 The condition worsened
 kuch to pehle do teen din main hi biimaar ho gaye
 Later, arrangements were made to drink their food from Gurdwara Rakabganj, then they stayed on the movement
 tabhi main inke bich gaya tha or samajhane kaa prayaas kiya tha ki ye kya maamla he
 All of them came in black clothes so that according to the coverage of the media, a visual element could also be made, but no media came
 kya aap ek naagarik ke taur par iskaa hisaab rakhana chahenge ki vot dene ke baad jab sarkaar ke saamne janata awaz uthaati he to vah sarkaar unki awaz sunati he yaa nahin
 Before August 2017, they had also agitated on January 30-31 2017
 usase bhi pehle disambar 2016 main andolan kar chuke the
 You tell me, the railway from which you have taken training, the same railway should not give a job, and when you ask any question, should it be so
 hamane jab pichley saal dikhaaya tha tab inhen yakeen nahin hua tha ki prime time main koi dikhaa saktaa he
 Today, when our colleague Sunil Kumar Singh went to talk to them, the youth became emotional
 dekhie agar media samaaj ke khilaaf ho jaataa he to aadmi kitna asahaay ho jaataa he
 Today's dock media has turned against the public
 aap jaanate hai ki railway ne is saal kareeb 90,000 bhartiyon nikaali hai
 But you do not know whether there is a structure to fulfill these recruitments or not, and in how many years these recruitments will be completed
 kya aap yah bhi jaanate hai ki railway ke paas 2 lakh 20 hazaar se adhik vekency he
 But the Railways has told the standing committee of Parliament that it is not its intention to fill all the posts
 baaki padon ko outsource yani theke par bhare jane kaa vikalp dekha ja rahaa he
 Today even if the railways announces the reinstatement of all 2 lakh 20 thousand posts, even then it cannot complete this recruitment before two to three years
 rail mantri kehete hai ki 20 pratishat reserve rakhane kii niti supreme court ke aadesh ke baad bani he lekin aprintins kehete hai ki railway kii apni banaai hui niti he
 Now we have no opinion on this because i do not have the facts
 bas ek patr he
 At this time, there is no big news in India except unemployment, jobs, and poor state of examination system
 agar ye khabar pehle panne par nahin he to yuvaaon ko akhbaar padhanaa chhod dena chahie
 Must stop watching TV
 aap sochie agra ke biaar ambedkar uniwarsity ke chaatro par kya biit rahi hogi, riselt nahin aayaa he lihaaza jo bhartee nikali he uske liye applai bhi nahin kar sakate

 On March 20, the Rajasthan Police Recruitment Exam was completely canceled
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 18 oktober 2017 ko 5500 sipaahiyon kii bhartee ke liye vigyaapan nikaala tha
 There was a fee of Rs 400 for general students, Rs 300 for scheduled castes and tribes
 itnaa paisa dekar chaar maheene baad jab march 2018 main imtahaan hota he to vah nakal ke kaaran radd ho jaati he
 Similarly, the headline is made at the time of every exam, and after the cancellation, the headline disappears gradually
 yuvaaon kaa kitna samay barbaad hua he
 Rajasthan Patrika has written that 16 lakh candidates are going to be affected
 15 march ke bhaskar main khabar chhapi he ki mukhyamantri ne tay kiya he ki is saal disbanr tak sari bhartee puri ho jaaegi
 You see how much recruitment is completed
 jab ham 5500 padon par bahaali samay se bina chori ke nahin kara sakate to kya 90,000 yaa 1 lakh padon kii bahaali bina teen chaar saal ke ho sakati he
 At times, it seems that governments leave such laxity that the case is canceled, and if not canceled, then it gets stuck in the case
 ieneldi ke saansad dushyant chautaala ne shram mantri se sawaal poocha he ki pichley teen saal main berojgaare kii vruddhi dar kya he, us dauraan naukari dene kaa kya lakshya tha, usamen kitni safalataa praapt hui he
 So the answer is that no target has been set by the government
 tathaapi, rojgaar srijan evam niyojaneeyata main sudhaar karnaa sarkaar kii pramukh praathamikta rahi he
 Many policies have been counted with this answer, from Mudra Yojana to Skill India
 magar unke kaaran kitnon ko rojgaar mila iskaa koi aankada nahin diya gaya he
 Whether the government does not have figures to tell or it does not have figures at all
 ye to agle chunaav ke slogan se hi pataa chalegaa
 These boys have visited Mumbai many times from different cities of Maharashtra
 19 march ko enditivi mumbai ke daftar pahunch gaye

 ye bachche dilli aakar prime time ke liye apni kahani bataanaa chaahate the magar inke paas dilli aane tak ke liye paise nahin the isliye ye mumbai sthit hamaare daftar gaye
 Around 450 students are waiting for their appointment with Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited Mahagenco
 2014 main dipti eczecutive ejeeniyar ke 212 pad kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha, jiske liye 17000 chaatro ne applai kar diya
 The form was filled by giving 500 rupees

 Result came on 20 March 2015
 450 log paas hue
 When he felt that he would get a government job, he quit his old job
 koi bhi chhod degaa kyonki sarkari naukari jo mili thi
 But a student filed a case on 4 June 2016
 in chaatro ne cese karne vaale chaatr se sampark kiya, use samajhaayaa ki sarkaar to sirf date lekar chali jaati he, mukadmaa to ladati nahin he or tumhaare chalate hamaara jivan barbaad ho gaya to us ladke ne julai 2017 main cese waapas le liya
 Now all the obstacles of their joining had gone away
 lekin uske baad saat maheene se zyaada samay ho chuke hai magar inaki jwining nahin hui he
 The decision of the court has come in their favor, even after this, there is no joining
 iskaa koi hisaab he ki saat maheene se ye jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai, yahaan vahaan bhatak rahe hai, awwal aapane duniya main kahi suna he ki sab kuch clear ho jane ke baad saat saat maheene tak jwining nahin ho rahi he
 The same is the position of the Staff Selection Commission
 abhi bhi hazaron chaatro ko agast 2017 main pariksha paas karne ke baad jwining letters nahin mila he
 Around a thousand students are waiting for the joining letter for the CAG assistant auditor
 in bacchon ke saath ye ninsaphi bardaasht kaise kii ja sakati he
 Outside the Staff Selection Commission, students have made a big agitation for rigging several times in examinations
 sansad kii sthai samiti kii report bhi ai he
 This report states that there are 2,220 court cases on the Staff Selection Commission
 to sawaal aata he ki court main cese kii sunwaayee tej gati se ho iskaa prayaas hona chahie kyonki isse naujavaanon kii zindagi barbaad ho rahi he
 The simple thing is, then if you listen to the vacancy of the judges, then today you will not be able to eat food, not only that something is happening other than slogan
 tippaniyan The report of the parliamentary committee says that in ten years, the responsibility of SSC has been taken to take the examination of more than twenty times the students
 2008-09 ke dauraan esayssi ke imtahaanon main kareeb das lakh chaatro ne hissaa liya tha
 In 2016-17, the number of students in SSC examinations increased to 2 crore
 lekin itani badi sankhya main chaatro ko sanbhaalane ke liye karmchaariyon kii sankhya jas kii tas he
 For ten years, the number of sanctioned posts of Commission staff has been stuck at 481 only
 isamen se bhi is vakt 115 pad khaali hai yani 24 pratishat pad khaali hai
 This commission does not fill the staff within its time
 do karod chaatr esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil hote hai
 Due to this, the lives of two crore students are affected, but the problems of its students did not get media coverage
 naukari series or inke apane andolan ke kaaran aaj aap esayssi ke bare main jaanate hai magar aap dekhie ki berojgaare badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne hi sara intazaam kiya hua he
 If it is not discussed then how will it change
 kab badalegaa
 The youth ended the picket on Yeddyurappa's assurance
 magar uske baad kuch nahin hua to ve 19 march se usee shahar main railway ke daaarem ke daftar ke baahar dharne par baith gaye hai
 They claim that more than 2000 youth have joined the dharna
 vaise ve bharat bhar main berojgaar aprintis kii sankhya 20,000 bataate hai
 Most 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 passes are out
 is bich 2016 ke saal main mumbai main 699 or gorakhpur main 45 or nardan railway main 13 aprintins rakhe gaye hai magar baaki berojgaar gum rahe hai
 When Yeddyurappa gave the assurance and these youth gave information to the General Manager of All India Railway Zone, even then their demand was not heard
 darasal noujvaan jab andolan karte hai to sarkarein sochati hai ki inhen koun cover karegaa
 There will be a commotion for two days and then the media will get busy with communal statements of an MP
 zarur in naujavaanon ko rail nahin rokani chahie thi lekin kya inaki baat kisi ko sunani nahin chahie thi? Last August, the Railway Apprentice came to Delhi
 10 agast se 21 agast ke bich jantar mantar par jamaa hue
 There was no money in his pocket

 Some became ill within the first two-three days

 Then i went among them and tried to understand what was the matter

 Would you, as a citizen, want to keep an account of whether the government listens to their voice when the public raises their voice in front of the government after voting

 They had agitated in December 2016 even before that
 aap hi bataaiye, jis railway se training lee ho, vahi railway naukari na de, or jab sawaal kare to kisi ko fark na pade, kya aisa hona chahie
 When we showed last year, he was not sure that anyone could show in prime time
 aaj sab hamaare sahyogi sunil kumaar singh inase baat karne gaye to noujvaan bhavuk ho gaye
 See how helpless a man becomes if the media goes against society
 aaj kaa godi media janata ke khilaaf ho gaya he
 You know that the Railways has removed about 90,000 recruits this year
 magar aap yah nahin jaanate ki in bhartiyon ko puraa karne kaa dhaancha he bhi yaa nahin or kitne saal main ye bhartiyon puri hongi
 Do you also know that the railway has more than 2 lakh 20 thousand vacancies
 magar railway ne sansad kii sthai samiti se kaha he ki uskaa iraadaa sabhi padon ko bharne kaa nahin he
 The option of outsourcing the remaining positions is being seen
 aaj agar railway sabhi 2 lakh 20 hazaar padon kii bahaali kaa elaan bhi kar de to bhi vah do teen saal se pehle is bharti ko puri nahin kar sakati he
 The Railway Minister says that the policy of keeping 20 percent reserve has been formed after the order of the Supreme Court, but the apprentices say that the Railways have their own policy
 ab is par hamaari koi raay nahin kyonki mere paas tathy nahin hai
 Just a letter
 is vakt bharat main berojgaare, naukari, pariksha pranali kii jarjar haalat ke alaava koi badi khabar nahin he
 If this news is not on the front page, then the youth should stop reading the newspaper
 tivi dekhnaa band kar dena chahie
 Think about what will happen to the students of BR Ambedkar University in Agra, the results have not come, so you cannot apply for the recruitment that has come out
 ve bhi kitna hindu muslim dibet dekhenge
 Throughout the day, there is a call from desperate students from Agra to get our results out
 kya aap chahenge ki aapke bacchon ko bhi yahi sazaa mili or kis baat kii sazaa mili
 We are not able to test a soldier without stealing and rigging
 20 march ko hi rajasthan me sipaahi bhartee pariksha puri tarah nirast kar di gai
 The Rajasthan government on 18 October 2017 had advertised for the recruitment of 5500 soldiers
 saamaanya chaatro ke liye 400, anusuchit jati or janajati ke liye 300 rupye kii fees thi
 After four months, when the examination takes place in March 2018, it gets canceled due to copying
 isi tarah har pariksha nikalne ke vakt hedline banati he, radd hone ke vakt hedline banane ke baad dhire-dhire gaayab ho jaati he
 How much time has been wasted by the youth
 rajasthan patrika ne likhaa he ki 16 lakh abhyarthi prabhavit hone ja rahe hai
 The news has appeared in Bhaskar of 15 March that the Chief Minister has decided that all the recruitment will be completed by December this year
 aap dekhte chaliye kitni bhartee puri hoti he
 When we cannot get 5500 posts reinstated without stealing on time, can 90,000 or 1 lakh posts be restored without three to four years
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkarein hi aisi dheel chhod detii hai ki maamla radd hota rahe, radd na ho to mukademe main fansata rahe
 INLD MP Dushyant Chautala has asked the Labor Minister the question of what is the growth rate of unemployment in the last three years, what was the goal of giving jobs during that time, how much success has been achieved in it
 to jawaab diya gaya he ki sarkaar dwaara koi lakshya nahin rakhaa gaya he
 However, improving employment generation and employability has been a major priority of the government
 is jawaab ke saath bahut sari nitiyaan gina di gayi hai, vahi mudra yojana se lekar skill india tak
 But no data has been given on how many people got employment because of them
 kya sarkaar ke paas bataane laayak aankade nahin hai yaa phir aankade he hi nahin
 This will be known only from the slogan of the next election

 These students approached the student who made the case, explained to him that the government only goes on a date, the case is not contested and because of you ruining our life, the boy withdrew the case in July 2017
 ab inaki jwining kii sari adchane dur ho gai thi
 But after that it has been more than seven months but they have not joined

 It is a calculation that for seven months, they have been waiting for joining, wandering here and there, you have heard in the world that everything is not joining for seven months after clearing everything

 Thousands of students still have not received the joining letter after passing the exam in August 2017

 How can this injustice be tolerated with these children? staff salection kamishan ke baahar chaatr kai baar pareekshaon main dhaandhlee ko lekar bada andolan kar chuke hai
 The report of the Standing Committee of Parliament has also come
 is report main kaha gaya he ki staff salection kamishan par 2,220 court cese hai
 So the question comes that the trial of the case in the court should be done at a fast pace because it is ruining the lives of the youth

 You tell me, the railway from which you have taken training, the same railway should not give a job, and when you ask any question, should it be so
 hamane jab pichley saal dikhaaya tha tab inhen yakeen nahin hua tha ki prime time main koi dikhaa saktaa he
 Today, when our colleague Sunil Kumar Singh went to talk to them, the youth became emotional
 dekhie agar media samaaj ke khilaaf ho jaataa he to aadmi kitna asahaay ho jaataa he
 Today's dock media has turned against the public
 aap jaanate hai ki railway ne is saal kareeb 90,000 bhartiyon nikaali hai
 But you do not know whether there is a structure to fulfill these recruitments or not, and in how many years these recruitments will be completed
 kya aap yah bhi jaanate hai ki railway ke paas 2 lakh 20 hazaar se adhik vekency he
 But the Railways has told the standing committee of Parliament that it is not its intention to fill all the posts
 baaki padon ko outsource yani theke par bhare jane kaa vikalp dekha ja rahaa he
 Today even if the railways announces the reinstatement of all 2 lakh 20 thousand posts, even then it cannot complete this recruitment before two to three years
 rail mantri kehete hai ki 20 pratishat reserve rakhane kii niti supreme court ke aadesh ke baad bani he lekin aprintins kehete hai ki railway kii apni banaai hui niti he
 Now we have no opinion on this because i do not have the facts

 On March 20, the Rajasthan Police Recruitment Exam was completely canceled
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 18 oktober 2017 ko 5500 sipaahiyon kii bhartee ke liye vigyaapan nikaala tha
 There was a fee of Rs 400 for general students, Rs 300 for scheduled castes and tribes
 itnaa paisa dekar chaar maheene baad jab march 2018 main imtahaan hota he to vah nakal ke kaaran radd ho jaati he
 Similarly, the headline is made at the time of every exam, and after the cancellation, the headline disappears gradually
 yuvaaon kaa kitna samay barbaad hua he
 Rajasthan Patrika has written that 16 lakh candidates are going to be affected
 15 march ke bhaskar main khabar chhapi he ki mukhyamantri ne tay kiya he ki is saal disbanr tak sari bhartee puri ho jaaegi
 You see how much recruitment is completed
 jab ham 5500 padon par bahaali samay se bina chori ke nahin kara sakate to kya 90,000 yaa 1 lakh padon kii bahaali bina teen chaar saal ke ho sakati he
 At times, it seems that governments leave such laxity that the case is canceled, and if not canceled, then it gets stuck in the case
 ieneldi ke saansad dushyant chautaala ne shram mantri se sawaal poocha he ki pichley teen saal main berojgaare kii vruddhi dar kya he, us dauraan naukari dene kaa kya lakshya tha, usamen kitni safalataa praapt hui he
 So the answer is that no target has been set by the government

 Many policies have been counted with this answer, from Mudra Yojana to Skill India

 Whether the government does not have figures to tell or it does not have figures at all

 The simple thing is, then if you listen to the vacancy of the judges, then today you will not be able to eat food, not only that something is happening other than slogan
 tippaniyan The report of the parliamentary committee says that in ten years, the responsibility of SSC has been taken to take the examination of more than twenty times the students
 2008-09 ke dauraan esayssi ke imtahaanon main kareeb das lakh chaatro ne hissaa liya tha
 In 2016-17, the number of students in SSC examinations increased to 2 crore
 lekin itani badi sankhya main chaatro ko sanbhaalane ke liye karmchaariyon kii sankhya jas kii tas he
 For ten years, the number of sanctioned posts of Commission staff has been stuck at 481 only
 isamen se bhi is vakt 115 pad khaali hai yani 24 pratishat pad khaali hai
 This commission does not fill the staff within its time
 do karod chaatr esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil hote hai
 Due to this, the lives of two crore students are affected, but the problems of its students did not get media coverage
 naukari series or inke apane andolan ke kaaran aaj aap esayssi ke bare main jaanate hai magar aap dekhie ki berojgaare badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne hi sara intazaam kiya hua he
 If it is not discussed then how will it change
 kab badalegaa
 You know that the Railways has removed about 90,000 recruits this year
 magar aap yah nahin jaanate ki in bhartiyon ko puraa karne kaa dhaancha he bhi yaa nahin or kitne saal main ye bhartiyon puri hongi
 Do you also know that the railway has more than 2 lakh 20 thousand vacancies
 magar railway ne sansad kii sthai samiti se kaha he ki uskaa iraadaa sabhi padon ko bharne kaa nahin he
 The option of outsourcing the remaining positions is being seen
 aaj agar railway sabhi 2 lakh 20 hazaar padon kii bahaali kaa elaan bhi kar de to bhi vah do teen saal se pehle is bharti ko puri nahin kar sakati he
 The Railway Minister says that the policy of keeping 20 percent reserve has been formed after the order of the Supreme Court, but the apprentices say that the Railways have their own policy
 ab is par hamaari koi raay nahin kyonki mere paas tathy nahin hai
 Just a letter
 is vakt bharat main berojgaare, naukari, pariksha pranali kii jarjar haalat ke alaava koi badi khabar nahin he
 If this news is not on the front page, then the youth should stop reading the newspaper
 tivi dekhnaa band kar dena chahie
 Think about what will happen to the students of BR Ambedkar University in Agra, the results have not come, so you cannot apply for the recruitment that has come out
 ve bhi kitna hindu muslim dibet dekhenge
 Throughout the day, there is a call from desperate students from Agra to get our results out
 kya aap chahenge ki aapke bacchon ko bhi yahi sazaa mili or kis baat kii sazaa mili
 We are not able to test a soldier without stealing and rigging
 20 march ko hi rajasthan me sipaahi bhartee pariksha puri tarah nirast kar di gai
 The Rajasthan government on 18 October 2017 had advertised for the recruitment of 5500 soldiers
 saamaanya chaatro ke liye 400, anusuchit jati or janajati ke liye 300 rupye kii fees thi
 After four months, when the examination takes place in March 2018, it gets canceled due to copying
 isi tarah har pariksha nikalne ke vakt hedline banati he, radd hone ke vakt hedline banane ke baad dhire-dhire gaayab ho jaati he
 How much time has been wasted by the youth
 rajasthan patrika ne likhaa he ki 16 lakh abhyarthi prabhavit hone ja rahe hai
 The news has appeared in Bhaskar of 15 March that the Chief Minister has decided that all the recruitment will be completed by December this year
 aap dekhte chaliye kitni bhartee puri hoti he
 When we cannot get 5500 posts reinstated without stealing on time, can 90,000 or 1 lakh posts be restored without three to four years
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkarein hi aisi dheel chhod detii hai ki maamla radd hota rahe, radd na ho to mukademe main fansata rahe
 INLD MP Dushyant Chautala has asked the Labor Minister the question of what is the growth rate of unemployment in the last three years, what was the goal of giving jobs during that time, how much success has been achieved in it
 to jawaab diya gaya he ki sarkaar dwaara koi lakshya nahin rakhaa gaya he
 However, improving employment generation and employability has been a major priority of the government
 is jawaab ke saath bahut sari nitiyaan gina di gayi hai, vahi mudra yojana se lekar skill india tak
 But no data has been given on how many people got employment because of them
 kya sarkaar ke paas bataane laayak aankade nahin hai yaa phir aankade he hi nahin
 This will be known only from the slogan of the next election
 maharashtra ke alag alag shaharon se ye ladke kai baar mumbai kaa chakkar laga chuke hai
 NDTV reached Mumbai's office on 19 March
 phir 20 march ko bhi aae
 These children wanted to come to Delhi and tell their story for prime time but they did not have money to come to Delhi so they went to our office in Mumbai
 kareeb 450 kii sankhya main ye chaatr maharashtra state power janareshan company limited mahajenko main apni niyukti kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 In 2014, 212 posts of deputy executive engineers were advertised, for which 17000 students applied
 500 rupee dekar farm bharaa tha
 Written test was taken on 11 January 2015
 20 march 2015 ko riselt aayaa
 450 people passed
 jab laga ki sarkari naukari mil jaaegi to inhone puraani naukari chhod di
 No one will leave because the government job they got
 lekin ek chaatr ne 4 june 2016 ko cese kar diya
 These students approached the student who made the case, explained to him that the government only goes on a date, the case is not contested and because of you ruining our life, the boy withdrew the case in July 2017
 ab inaki jwining kii sari adchane dur ho gai thi
 But after that it has been more than seven months but they have not joined
 adaalat kaa nirnay inke paksh main hi aayaa he iske baad bhi jwining nahin hui he
 It is a calculation that for seven months, they have been waiting for joining, wandering here and there, you have heard in the world that everything is not joining for seven months after clearing everything
 staff salection kamishan kaa bhi yahi haal he
 Thousands of students still have not received the joining letter after passing the exam in August 2017
 sieji ke sahaayak auditor ke liye hazaar ke kareeb chaatr jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 How can this injustice be tolerated with these children? staff salection kamishan ke baahar chaatr kai baar pareekshaon main dhaandhlee ko lekar bada andolan kar chuke hai
 The report of the Standing Committee of Parliament has also come
 is report main kaha gaya he ki staff salection kamishan par 2,220 court cese hai
 So the question comes that the trial of the case in the court should be done at a fast pace because it is ruining the lives of the youth
 simpal baat he, phir aap jajon kii vekainsee kaa haal sunenge to aaj khaanaa nahin kha paaenge lagegaa hi nahin ki slogan ke alaava kuch ho bhi rahaa he
 The comments sansadeey samiti kii report main kaha gaya he ki das saal main esayssi ke jimme bees guna se adhik chaatro kii pariksha lene kii zimmedaari aa gai he
 About one million students participated in SSC examinations during 2008-09
 2016-17 main esayssi ke imtahaanon main shaamil chaatro kii sankhya badhkar 2 karod ho gai
 But the number of employees to handle such a large number of students remains the same
 das saal se ayog ke karmchaariyon kii sweekrut padon kii sankhya 481 par hi ataki he
 Of this, 115 posts are vacant at this time i
e
 24 per cent are vacant
 yah ayog apane bheetar karmchaariyon ko samay se nahin bhar paata he
 Twenty million students attend SSC examinations
 iske kaaran do karod chaatro kii zindagi prabhavit hoti he phir bhi iske chaatro kii samasyaon ko media kawarez nahin miltaa tha
 Today you know about SSC due to job series and their own movement, but you see that the government has made all the arrangements to increase unemployment
 agar is par charchaa nahin hogi to yah kaise badalegaa
 When will it change rail mantri kehete hai ki 20 pratishat reserve rakhane kii niti supreme court ke aadesh ke baad bani he lekin aprintins kehete hai ki railway kii apni banaai hui niti he
 Now we have no opinion on this because i do not have the facts

 On Wednesday evening, as soon as Nitish Kumar came out of the Raj Bhavan by resigning his resignation to the Governor of Bihar, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted and congratulated him
 piem modi ne apane twit main nitish kumaar ko bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai main shaamil hone ke liye shubhakamana di
 After some time Nitish Kumar also tweeted and thanked him
 modi ke is twit ke saath hi lagbhag ye tay ho gaya tha ki bijepi nitash kumaar ko samarthan dekar bihar main sarkaar banavaayegi
 That is, Nitish once 'returned home'
 isse ek baar phir ye sabit ho gaya ki raajnneeti main na koi dost hota he, na koi dushman
 By the way, if we talk about PM Modi and Nitish Kumar, there are many similarities between the two
 1
 The agenda of development is Nitish Kumar, known as Good Governance Babu
 saath hi unhone bihar ko vikaas kii nai disha main aage badhaayaa
 Nitish Kumar not only provided electricity to Bihar, which was called a sick state, but also took roads to remote villages
 duusari taraf narendra modi ko gujarat main vikaas se sabase bade pratik ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 Gujarat achieved new milestones of development during Modi's chief ministership
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad bhi modi sirf or sirf vikaas par bal dete hue najar aate hai
 2
 siem kii kursi sanbhaalane ke baad haare nahithish march 2000 main pehali baar bihar ke mukhyamantri bane
 However, he remained CM for only 7 days in this term
 magar, iske baad 2005 main nitish kumaar ne siem kii kursi sambhalakar apana kaarykaal puraa kiya
 In 2010, he once again came to power in Bihar
 doosraa kaarykaal puraa hone se kuch din pehle nitish ne istipha dekar jeethanram maanjhi ko siem bana diya
 But after 9 months, he came back once again
 2015 main argedy or congress gathbandhan ke saath milakar nitish kumaar ek baar phir se bihar kii kursi tak pahunch gaye
 On the other hand, Narendra Modi was sworn in as the CM of Gujarat in October 2001 for the first time
 iske baad 2002 ke chunaav main jeet ke saath modi phir gujarat ke mukhyamantri bane
 Then in 2007 and 2012 too, Modi came to power in Gujarat with a landslide victory

 Kadanarendra Modi and Nitish Kumar, who are bigger than the party, may present themselves as party workers, but their stature is bigger than the party
 jediu ke rashtriya adhyaksh pad se sharad yadav ke hatane ke baad nitish kumaar is pad par kabiz hue
 It is believed that Nitish Kumar has all the power to take decisions in JDU
 vahiin duusari taraf party vid e diference ke naare ke saath kaam karne vaali bijepi main sanghathan ko sarvopari mana jaataa he
 However, after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, Amit Shah, the closest to Modi, was made the national president of the party

 achaanak faisle lene main sakshamanarendra modi ne piem pad par rahete hue achaanak 8 november, 2016 ko desh main notebandi kaa elaan kar diya

 In the subsequent Lok Sabha elections, when JDU was in decline, Nitish once again resigned from the post of CM, taking moral responsibility for it and placed Jitan Ram Manjhi on the chair
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle lalu prasad kii party rajd, nitish kii jadyu or congress ne milakar mahagathbandhan kaa elaan kiya

 As the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there was less talk of corruption on the Narendra Modi government
 vahiin nitish kumaar bhrashtachar par jiro tolerance kii niti ko apanaate hai

 According to this legend, at one time the gods and the demons decided to share the churning of the sea and all the gems that appear through it
 unke bich in ratnon ke batwaare ko lekar atyant matbhed hue
 The most valuable gem that came out of the churning of the ocean was nectar, both the gods and the demons desired to get it
 amrit paan karne vaala vyakti amar ho jaataa he
 The almighty and imperishable gods never accepted that the Asuras should become immortal and spread the kingdom of sin in the world
 katha main devtaa or asur amrit ke paatr ke liye yuddh karane lage tab bhagwaan vishnu ne mohini naamak apsara kaa rup lekar amrit paatr ko asuron se dur kiya
 To save the nectar from the Asuras, Lord Vishnu gave the vessel to Garuda
 asuron ne jab garud se vah paatr chhinane kii cheshtaa kari to us paatr main se amrit kii kuch boonden chhalak kar elahabaad, nasik, haridwar or ujjain main giriin
 Since then, Kumbh Mela is held at these places at an interval of every 12 years
 samudr manthan ke liye parvat ke ek shikhar ko mathni evam ek sarp ko rassi banane ke liye upyog kiya gaya
 The divine horse, elephant, holy cow, etc
 were generated through the churning and terrible poison was also generated by which the entire creation could be destroyed, then Lord Shiva swallowed that terrible poison and protected the world
 manthan ke dwaara utpann hui prayek vastu yahaan tak ki chaar veda bhi vibhinn devataaon ko de die gaye the
 Asuras had their eyes on the nectar
 As soon as the nectar appeared, the asuras moved against the gods

 Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Anil Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao starrer film 'fanney Khan' is releasing on August 3, but before that one of the songs of the film has been changed
 pehle is gane ke bol the, 'mere achche din kab aaenge', lekin ab kiya gaya he 'achche din ab aaye re'
 Aishwarya's Fanne Khan's release again increased, this film will clash with 'when will my good days come' was considered as an attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's political campaign 'achhe Din'
 ab is gane main badlaav kiya gaya he
 Instead, the lyrics have been changed to 'achhe Din Ab Aaye Re'
 is sabake bich sawaal paidaa ho rahe hai ki kya phanne khan ke gane main badlaav karne ke liye nirmaataaon par kisi kaa dabaav tha
 The new song had added trouble to the producers
 soshal media par is gane kii aad main piem modi par nishaanaa saadhaa ja rahaa tha, unke chunavi vaadon kaa majaak udaaya ja rahaa tha
 Perhaps to avoid controversy after this, the makers launched a new song
 phanne khan main aishwarya kaa First Look out, tin beauty queen se nahin hai kambata den ki phanne khan ke saamne pehle hi ek chunauti klesh kii he
 Two more films are being released with this film
 ye hai 'mulk' or 'kaaravaan'

 His funeral will be held in the evening at Dadar crematorium
 " dube 'pagalaa ghoda', 'aadhe adhure' or 'evam indrajit' jaise naatakon ke liye prasiddh the lekin unhen prasiddhi 'andhaa yug' ne dilaai
 He was born in Chhattisgarh city of Bilaspur in 1936
 dube mumbai cricketer banane aae the lekin vah ibrahim alkaji dwaara sanchalit theatre main shaamil ho gaye
 After Alkaji became the head of the National School of Drama in Delhi, he started operating the theater
 unhone girish karnad ke pehle naatak 'yayati' kaa nirmaan kiya
 Apart from this, 'hayavadna' is prominent
 unhen dharmaveer bharti ke radio ke likhe naatak 'andhaa yug' ko rangamanch par utaarne kaa shrey diya jaataa he

 chinmayanand maamle (chinmayanand case) main uttar pradesh police ne buudhvaar ko adaalat main 4700 pej kii chargeshit daakhil kar di he
 Police claimed that the forensic investigation found the visuals of Chinmayananda giving the girl a massage
 vahiin ladki or uske saathiyon kii video kii forencik jaanch se unke rangadari maangane kii bhi pushti hoti he
 Not only this, the SIT has claimed that two BJP leaders of Shahjahanpur were also asking Chinmayananda for extortion of one and a quarter crores for his video
 unke naam bhi chargeshit main daakhil kar die gaye hai
 Police on Wednesday produced both Chinmayanand and the girl who accused him of rape in the court
 esaiti ne kaha ki ashram ke ek-ek kamare ke parade, gadde or tel kii katori kii forencik jaanch main chinmayanand ke nagn hokar ladki se maalish karaane kaa aarope sahi paaya he
 SIT IG Naveen Arora said, "those who have taken the bowl, towel or curtain from there all match the bowl, curtain and towel seen in the video
 isaki pushti bhi foracinc lab kii reports se hoti he
 This proves that the evidence of the videos made by the girl through glasses are present there
 '' esaiti kaa kahana he ki forencik jaanch se sabit hua he ki ladki ke dost sanjay ne hi chinmayanand ko unki ashleel photo watsape kar rangadari maangi thi
 Naveen Arora said, during investigation we found that a whatsapp number which was taken by Sanjay on fake ID from Divyanshu and installed on his phone
 isi watsape se swami chinmayanand ke watsape number par wo massej bheja gaya tha
 And not only did the message recover but we also got screenshots of the photos sent along with it, so that we were in a position to prove that this constitutes the offense of Section 67A IT Act
 esaiti kaa daawa he ki shahjahanpur ke do bijepi netaa ajit singh or dspi rathore bhi chinmayanand se sava karod kii rangadari maang rahe the
 DSP Rathore is the chairman of Jili Sahakari Bank and seems fond of being photographed with top BJP leaders
 ye log ladki se chinmayanand ke video vaali pen drive hifaazat se rakhane ke bahaane maang laae the
 Then they too began to wash their hands in the flowing Ganges
 unke naam bhi chargeshit main daakhil kiye gaye
 Arora said that this advice was also given by Ajit and DPS that AAP has evidence and the police will find it in the search
 isliye behatar hoga ki ye unhen de die jaaen
 He told, when these people came back, they were definitely aware that no such evidence may be with the children now and we only have the evidence
 unhone uski ek-ek copy banaai or chinmayanand se tol-mol karne lage
 Explain that it took a full 2 months to investigate the SIT and file the chargesheet
 6 sitambar ko jaanch shuru kii gai thi
 Statements of 105 people were taken in it
 55ke dastavaji saboot jutaaye gaye or donon maamalon main 7 logon ke khilaaf exiaar hui
 Under sections 376,342 and 506 against Chinmayananda
 ladki or uske saathiyon ke khilaaf dhara 34,201,385,506,507 or 67e iti act ke tahat
 At the same time, charge sheets have been filed against BJP leaders DPS Rathore and Ajit Singh under sections 201,385 and 506
 chargeshit daakhil hone par ladki ke ghar vaale kehete hai ki kuch ladako ke saath unki ladki kii video se ye sabit nahin hota ki wo rangadari maangane main shaamil he
 The girl is implicated because of Chinmayananda's influence
 vahiin is maamle par chinmayanand ke vakil kaa kahana he ki esaiti jis video kii baat kar rahi he usamen bhi chinmayanand ladki se jor jabardastee karte nahin najar aate hai
 Therefore, the allegations against them are baseless
 unhone kaha, ''ye puraa maamla be buniyaad he or rangadari ke aropiyon dwaara is maamle se bachane ke liye swami chinmayanand ke viruddh shadyantra ke tahat nai kahani gadhi gai

 Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has broken the silence on the talk of an alliance between Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party
 unhone kaha ki gathbandhan ke sawaal par abhi kuch nahin boluungaa
 Attacking the BJP directly, he said that the Center is using the CBI against me to stop the alliance
 samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main bijepi virdohi kisi bhi prakaar kaa gathbandhan na ho paae, isliye centre kii modi sarkaar mujh par sibiai dwaara chhapemari karvaa rahi he
 At the same time, Akhilesh also targeted the Congress under the guise of the BJP
 unhone kaha ki pehle upie ke kaarykaal main congress ne sibiai se mulaakaat karai or ab centre kii endie sarkaar ne sibiai se mulaakaat karvaa rahi he
 Let us tell you that there were reports in the media on Friday that in the 80 Lok Sabha seats of UP, seats have been split between Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party
 bataaya gaya ki donon partiyon ne 71 siton ko aapas main baant liya he
 The SP can contest 35 Lok Sabha seats in the state and the BSP in 36 Lok Sabha seats

 Congress appeared to be missing in this formula of seat sharing

 Along with this, he denied any such alliance
 iske baad ab sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ne bhi sabhi atakalon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki gathbandhan ko lekar abhi koi baat nahin kahuunga
 It is believed that Akhilesh is realizing the intent of the Congress and is waiting for an appropriate time to join the alliance with his own terms

 com / vfctrfbahg Google is trying to shock the wireless phone industry with cheaper service, which will put pressure on major operators to make online and Google services cheaper
 google ne guuruuvaar ko ek seva ‘project fi’ pesh kiya
 It was announced by Google two months ago, in which it revealed its plans to provide wireless connection service to smartphones
 google ink aadharbhoot phone seva 20 dollar prati maah par uplabdh kara rahi he or graahakon se ekamusth keemat ke bajaay har maheene upyog kiye gaye cellular data ke aadhaar par shulk liya jayega
 The comments ek jibi internet kaa shulk 10 dollar prati maah hoga
 This means customers can get a plan that has three GB of data and if they used only one GB in a month, they would get $ 20 back
 zyaadaatar wireles phone companiyaan apane graahakon ko paise waapas karne ke bajaay anupyukt data kaa istemaal duusare maheene main karne kii ijaajat detii hai
 Project y-fi will initially be sold to only a small number of people who have Nexus-6
 is smartphone ko google kii madad se motorola mobility ne banaaya he
 With Google's pricing, 'project Fai' is the cheapest plan compared to the largest wireless carriers Verizon, AT&T, t-mobile and Sprint
 isaki ghoshnaa google ne do maheene pehle kii thi, jisamen usne smartphone ko wireles conection seva pradaan karne kii apni yojana kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 Google Inc
 is providing basic phone service at $ 20 per month and customers will be charged based on cellular data used every month, rather than a one-time price
 tippaniyan One GB of internet charges will be $ 10 per month
 iskaa arth he graahakon ko aisi yojana mil sakati he jisamen teen jibi data ho or yadi ek maheene main unhone sirf ek jibi istemaal kiya to unhen 20 dollar waapas mil jaaenge
 Most wireless phone companies allow their customers to use inappropriate data in the second month instead of returning money
 project vaay-faay shuruuaat main sirf un bahut kam logon ko bechaa jayega jinke paas nexs-6 ho
 This smartphone is made by Motorola Mobility with the help of Google

 supreme court main ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayee main kapil sibbal kii peshi paheli ban kar rah gai he
 Kapil Sibal has claimed to solve it
 safai bhi di lekin paheli ke pench barkaraar hai
 Since blindfold is legal, it is not going to end so soon
 kapil sibbal khud ghaagh vakil hai
 So how can you give a walkover in such a big game so cheaply
 sunwaayee par vivaad to usee shaam yani paanch disambar ko hi shuru ho gaya
 On December 6, Prime Minister Narendra Modi staged political shooting at Gujarat's election rallies by holding Kapil Sibal's shoulder
 congress bhi tilamila gai
 And Sibal had kept the tongue locked
 ab ram hi jane kii jaan boojhkar yaa anjaane main
 Sibal broke the silence after a full 48 hours had passed
 court ke 12 panne ke aadesh ko dhaal banaakar media ke saamne aae
 Said he did not become a lawyer for the UP Central Sunni Waqf Board
 unhone court main jo kuch kaha wo pakshakarhashim ansaari or ikbaal ansarike vakil ke rup main kaha
 The court has also mentioned this in the order
 is maamle main jab wo bol rahe hai adaalat kaa aadesh bol rahaa he to idhar-udhar bolne vaale chup kyon nahin hote
 It is better if the matter of court remains till the court
 baahar uski bevajaah charchaa kyon he
 This was Sibal's explanation
 lekin kya safai ke itane bhar tinopal se iljaamon ke daag dhul jaaenge
 Because the four-drop light has not yet appeared in the books of Tokun
 kyonki shaatir chor bhi kahin naa kahin saboot chhod hi jaataa he or kanoon ke lambey haath us tak pahunch hi jate hai
 Now, if we examine the order of the court, the first six and a half pages also clearly mention that Kapil Sibal is a lawyer in Ayodhya related case No
 4192 in which the UP Central Sunni Waqf Board is a case
 vakf board ke edwocket on record saiyad shahid rizvi kii ore se mukhya nyaayadhish kii court main paanch disambar ko daakhil vakeelon kii peshi kii parchi par bhi pehle number par kapil sibbal, senior edwocket kaa naam darj hai
 The signature below also belongs to Rizvi
 ajtak ne court ke record se peshi kii parchi nikalwakar kar jab rizvi se poocha to unhone ye to sweekaar kiya ki dastakhat unheen ke hai
 But his postponement regarding the name remained
 wo lagaataar ye kehete rahe ki sibbal board ke vakil nahin the
 Its attire is on the second page of the order
 jisamen court ne unke naam ke aage mukadmaa sankhya 2894 or 7226 likhaa he jo hashim ansaari kii ore se darj he
 Now if we look at the other aspect, the court had said at the beginning of the hearing that it would listen to the main three parties
 iskaa zikr 11 agast ko die supreme court ke aadesh main bhi he
 Now the three main parties are Ramlala Virajaman, Nirmohi Akhara and Sunni Central Waqf Board
 hairaani kii baat he ki kareeb do ghante chali sunwaayee main muslim paksh kii ore se kapil sibbal or rajeev dhawan hi bolte rahe
 Among these, Sibal is not the advocate for the main three parties
 aise main sawaal ye bhi khadaa hota he ki sunni vakf board kii numaaindgi itane bade maamle main kisi ne nahin kii
 How did the court hear Sibal when Sibal was Ansari's lawyer
 yani sibbal ne to ragad-ragad kar safai de di
 But there are stains
 ye alag baat he ki sibbal or bijepi donon ko lagata he ki chalo daag hai to kya hua hai to achche hai

 Terrorist attack on Pathankot airbase
 3 din tak chale oparation ke baad airbase ko aatankiyon se puri tarah mukt karaayaa ja sakaa
 7 Indian soldiers died in this operation
 in beshkeemtee jaanon ko bachaaya ja saktaa tha, agar airbase kii suraksha vyavastha main kuch khamiyaan nahin rahi hotin
 This is revealed by an internal investigation report
 india today ke haath lagi is report main saaf taur par kaha gaya he ki lachar planning or suraksha main khaamiyon kii vajah se aatankiyon ke liye airbase main send lagaana aasaan ho gaya
 The Pathankot airbase near the indo-pakistan border is considered to be the leading base of the Indian Air Force (IAF)
 1-2 janvari 2016 kii aadhi raat ko airbase kii suraksha main aatankiyon ke send lagane se har koi hairaan rah gaya
 The Prime Minister had expressed his displeasure over security lapses
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a serious note of the attack and held a meeting with top security officials
 saath hi airbase kii suraksha main jis tarah aatankiyon ne send lagaai, us par gahari naaraazgi kaa izhaar kiya
 The inquiry was ordered in view of the Prime Minister's strict stance
 IAF ne pehle jaanch kaa aadesh nahin diya tha lekin use phir aisa karne ke liye kadam uthaanaa padaa
 The investigation was conducted by Air vice-marshal Amit Dev
 samajha jaataa he ki report main saamne aayaa ki airbase par buniyadi suraksha protocol kaa istemaal nahin hua
 In the report, responsibility was laid on the senior officials of the airbase for the deficiencies in security
 purv chetavanee ke baavjood pukhta taiyaari nahin kii gaijaanch main sambhavat: is nishkarsh par pahunchaa gaya ki hamale kii pehle se hi saaf or sateek khufia soochna hone ke baavjood airbase kii pukhta suraksha ke liye vistrut plan nahin banaaya gaya
 The investigation report also mentions the name of Air Commodore JS Dhamun, the then commander of the Pathankot airbase
 air kamador dhamun istipha de chuke hai
 Please tell that two months after the attack, Air Commodore was transferred from Pathankot, but Air Commodore Dhamun had to leave the army due to several security lapses in the IAF investigation
 farvari 2016 main air kamador dhamun kaa pathankot se transfar hua
 In January 2017 IAF selected him for the prestigious course of National Defense College
 ye is saal bangladesh ke liye nirdhaarit tha
 This course is considered a high career ladder in military service
 ye course puraa karne ke baad dhamun air vaais marshall pad par pronnati ke hakdaar ho jate
 Highly placed sources in the army told Aaj Tak that the Defense Ministry had raised serious objections to the nomination of Dhamun for the National Defense College
 lagbhag usee samay pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pathankot se jude ghatnakram ko lekar chintaa jaahir kii thi
 The NDC nomination of Kamador Dhamun was withdrawn in February 2017, according to highly placed sources
 iske baad pathankot ko lekar jaanch kaa aadesh diya gaya
 An internal investigation report in may-june 2017 held him and others responsible for security flaws at the airbase
 ucch sutron ke mutabik kuch or IAF adhikari or jawan bhi nirdhaarit prakriya kaa paalan nahin karne ke liye apni varishthata kho sakate hai
 The then airbase security officer has also been severely criticized
 kuch maheene pehle bhi lagi thi suraksha main sendhasbase hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki aatankiyon ne airbase menghuspaith ke lieusi root kaa istemaal kiya, jis par hamale se kuch maheene pehle bhi send lagi thi
 At that time, a mentally unstable man managed to sneak in, penetrating the airbase's security
 sutron ke mutabik jaanch report main is ghatana kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Several flaws in the security system revealed in the investigation report, the report said that there were many flaws in the security of the frontline airbase spread over 2000 acres
 iske alaava pratishthanon kii suraksha ke liye jis standard oparating proscisger (SOP) kaa paalan kiya jaataa he, usamen bhi chook hui
 This enabled the terrorists to enter the airbase and then hide themselves there
 report main khaamiyon ko ingit karte hue kaha gaya he ki airbase ke bahari suraksha ghere par sthit pedo or ghaas kii kataai-chantai nahin kii gai
 The guard post at the enclosure was not properly maintained
 ghuspaith par najar rakhane ke liye jin flud lits kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he wo bhi sahi tareeke se kaam nahin kar rahi thim
 The investigation also revealed that Airbase Security also failed to identify the ropes that were used to climb the wall of the airbase
 airbase hai alert par tha iske baad bhi aatanki ke kapade or chode hue khaane kaa suraag nahin lagaaya ja sakaa
 According to an internal investigation report a complete breakdown of the command was observed
 hamale kaa prabhavi dhang se jawaab dene main vyapak naakaami saamne ai
 Even the crack guard commando team could not compel the terrorists
 tivi today ne is sandarbh main raksha mantralay se sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya to koi jawaab nahin mila
 The Chief of Air Staff warned in the letter earlier this month that Air Chief Air Marshal BS Dhanoa had addressed a letter to IAF officials warning of compliance with high standards, lack of professionalism in the force and increasing bias
 IAF ke 12,000 adhikariyon ko bheji gai chitthee main kaha gaya ki force main dhilaai ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Garuda commandos are being deployed in Jammu and Kashmir
 Special squad of Indian Air Force 'garuda Commandos' first encountered the terrorists during the attack on Pathankot airbase
 'garud commando' ko ab bhartiya sena ke saath jammu-kashmir main aatankwaad virdohi oparations ke liye tainaat kiya ja rahaa he
 High sources said, "garuda is a capable force but he has to get accustomed to tough battle situations
 jaanch report ke aadhaar par sarkaar ne garud commando ko jammu-kashmir main tainaat karne kaa faisla kiya he
 "air Commodore Dhamun transferred from Pathankot in February 2016
 janvari 2017 main IAF ne unhen neshnal dephence college ke pratishthit course ke liye chunaa
 It was scheduled for Bangladesh this year
 is course ko military seva main oonche kariyar kii seedhi mana jaataa he
 After completing these courses, Dhamun would be entitled to promotion to the post of Air Vice Marshal
 sena ke ucch padasth sutron ne aaj tak ko bataaya ki raksha mantralay ne neshnal dephence college ke liye manonayan par gambhir aapatti jataai thi
 Around the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had expressed concern about the developments related to Pathankot
 ucch padasth sutron ke mutabik kamador dhamun kaa endisi manonayan farvari 2017 main waapas le liya gaya
 After this, an inquiry was ordered regarding Pathankot
 may-june 2017 main aantarik jaanch report main unhen or anya ko airbase par suraksha khaamiyon ke liye jimmedaar mana gaya
 The internal investigation report cited flaws that appeared at the airbase during the Pathankot attack
 iske mutabik cmand kaa puraa brakedown dekha gaya
 There was widespread failure to respond to the attack effectively
 yahaan tak ki crack guard commando team aatankiyon ko baadhya nahin kar saki
 Late night parties, beautiful beauties, belly dancers and endless fun, but behind this metaphorical night life of the metropolis is so dark that when the night passes, the day is still dark
 videshi hasinaaon kaa katldilli main kuch aisi hi raaton kii chakachaundh ke baad jab subah hui to jurm kii wo kahani saamne ai ki sunne waalon ke rongte khadey ho gaye
 Two such beautiful and captivating foreign beauties that had become the life of a late night party had been murdered
 uzbekistan se ai ek beli dancer ek roj achaanak gaayab ho jaati he
 The police make every effort to find him, but he is not found
 phir ek roj achaanak uski laash milti he
 After this the investigation of murder begins
 beli dancer kii ek dost kaatilatafteesh ke baad police usee beli dancer kii ek dost ko kaatil qaraar dekar uski talash shuru kar detii he
 But later it is learned that the police, who were considering the murderer, have themselves been killed
 sex racket ke ird-gird buni gai dohare katl kii is sajeesh main daulat, shoharat, nafrat, dhokhaa sab kuch he
 Among them, the police found a dead body of Shakhanoja from a deserted place in Panipat area of haryana, far from Delhi, while the other girl Naz's body was also found outside Delhi from Hapur area of UP
 ittefaq dekhie ki ye donon hi ladkiyaan ek hi din dilli se rahasyamayi tareeke se gaayab ho gai thim, lekin donon kii laash ek-duusare se kaaphi dur or alag alag tarikhon ko mili
 Shakhanoja, living in Kishangarh, Delhi, had gone out to go somewhere with her driver on the night of 24 September, but in the meantime something happened that no one could imagine
 jab wo south eks ilaake main pahunchi, to use kisi ne agava kar liya
 The moment Shakhanoja was abducted, Vomobile was on the phone talking to her mother in Uzbekistan and started shouting as soon as she was bullied
 uski cheekh dilli se hajaaron mile dur uzbekistan bhi pahunchi
 But shortly after the mobile phone switched off, this scream got suffocated
 shakhanoja kii maa ne dilli main maujuud apane rishtedaaron ko phone par apni beti ke saath hue is haadase kii khabar di or use dhundhane ko kaha
 Relatives then complained to the Delhi Police, but the police did not take the matter seriously then
 polisake paas shakhanoja ko agava kiye jane ke pukhta suraag the kyonki shakhanoja kii maa ke bataane par uske rishtedaaron ne yahaan police ko use agava karanevaale kuch logon ke naam bhi bataae the or inhen naamon main ek thi shakhanoja kii hamawatan dost or party argeniser naaj atajanova
 But despite this, the police did not even register a single report in this case
 police kii laaparvaahee bhi maut kii vajahabaad main police kii yahi kahili naa sirf shakhanoja balki uski dost naaj kii bhi maut kii vajah ban gai
 On September 25, the next day after the abduction, Panipat police recovered the body of Shakhanoja in unclaimed condition, while Hapur police found Naz's body in anonymity on 11 October, exactly 11 days after that
 apni beti ke apharan se pareshaan ab uski maa sidhe uzbekistan se dilli aa pahunchi or iske baad thane se lekar disipi offis tak ke anginat chakkar lagane ke baad aakhirkaar 8 oktober ko kotla mubarakapur kii police ne shakhanoja ke apahan kii report darj kii
 The corpse found after a few hours of kidnapping, a few hours after the kidnapping, the slayers on the delhi-haryana border not only strangled and slaughtered Shankhoja, but also put the corpse in a suitcase and burned it in Panipat
 haryana police ne shakhanoja kii laash ko laavaaris laash maan kar uskaa postmortem karwaane or visra rakhane ke baad uskaa antim sanskaar kar diya
 Shakhanoja's mother told the police that along with Naz, a man named Gagan was also involved with some of his friends who kidnapped his daughter
 inamen gagan or baaki ke dost to police ke saamne aakar shakhanoja ke gharavaalon ke tamaam iljaamon ko jhuthalaate rahe, lekin naaj kabhi saamne nahin ai
 When the police asked Gagan about Shakhanoja and Naaz, Gagan kept telling the police that the two had gone somewhere of their own free will
 jab 50 din se bhi zyada kaa vakt guzarane ke baad donon ladakiyon kaa kuch pataa nahin chalaa, to ab tak maamle ko halke main le rahi police gagan se sakhti par utar ai or bas yaheen gagan ne ek aisi baat bataai ki police ke pairon tale jameen khisak gai
 She told that Naz was also involved with Shakhanoja's murder, but after committing the crime, she fled somewhere else
 is tarah police ne pehali ladki yani shakhanoja ke apharan or katl kaa maamla to sulajhaa liya tha, lekin use ab bhi naaj kii talash thi, jo shakhanoja ke agava honevaale din se hi gaayab chal rahi thi
 Amidst the revelation of the sex racket, the police received a letter from the family of Shakhanoja, which overturned the story of Naaz's disappearance
 uzbek language main likhaa ye khat naaj kaa tha
 It was written in the letter, 'gagan has been exploiting me continuously since coming to India
 mujhe wo bade or amir logon ke saamne pesh kar rahaa he
 i am badly trapped in her sex racket
 aise main agar mere saath kuch hota he, to uskaa jimmedaar gagan hi hoga
 Gagan made another disclosure just three days after the revelation of the murder due to death
 gagan ne bataaya ki usne 5 oktober ko naaj kaa katl karne ke baad uski laash bhi hapur main jala di thi
 Gagan told the police that Shakhanoja was to receive Rs 8 lakh from Naaz
 naaj ye rupye nahin de paa rahi thi or yahi rupye donon ke bich dushmani kii vajah ban gai
 Shakhanoja had mortgaged Naz's passport and bought some jewelery and on the day of Shakhanoja's kidnapping, both of them called him to settle the case
 lekin iske baad halaat kuch aise bane ki gagan ne pehle naaj ke saath mil kar shakhanoja kaa katl kiya or phir dhokhe se naaj ko bhi maar daalaa
