 Input: IANS purv bhartiya nausainik kulbhushan jadhav ko pakistan main achaanak maut kii sajaa suna di gai
 There are clear indications that the Pakistan Army has taken this step in a hurry due to fear of Indian action on a Pakistani army officer caught on the indo-nepal border
 donon deshon ke jarnliston dwaara soshal media par shadyantr kaa aarope lagaate hue tarah-tarah ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 But one thing is common that Lieutenant Colonel Mo
 habib nepal main gaayab hai
 So is the Pakistani action related to the kidnapping of a Pakistan Army officer in Nepal? If so, it is not a common practice
 bhartiya paksh kaa maananaa he ki kulbhushan jadhav ko maut kii sajaa dene ke peeche pakistan kaa makasad ye he ki bharat bhi leftinent karnal habib ke khilaaf karrwai kii ghoshnaa karne ko majaboor ho
 At the same time, the Pakistani side believes that before Pakistani action on Jadhav, India arrested Habib, so that he could be forced to negotiate
 India has rejected charge of espionage against Jadhav, a former Indian Navy personnel
 - Rezaul Hasan Laskar (@rezhasan) April 10, 2017 Accusations? Accusations on both sides seem ridiculous, as neither India has yet announced that a Pakistani officer has been arrested, nor Pakistan has alleged that India has caught any of its officers
 abhi tak ke sabhi sanket media report se hai
 On social media, some Pakistanis are alleging that India has arrested Habib so that pressure can be put on Pakistan to free Jadhav
 nepal se pakistani adhikari ke apharan kii khabar abhi puri tarah saaf bhi nahin ho pai he ki pakistan ne bhartiya adhikari ko sazaa-e-maut suna di he
 On Monday, the Pakistani army court sentenced Jadhav to death
 bharat ne pakistani karrwai par kadaa virodh jataayaa he
 The Foreign Ministry summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit
 jadhav par pakistan main ro ke liye kaam karne kaa aarope laga tha
 He was arrested on March 3, 2016 from Balochistan

 Habib's disappearance was discussed in a whatsapp group of retired Pakistani Army officers
 iske baad yah baat media main saamne aa gai
 It is being told that Habib used to work for a private firm after retiring in 2014
 vah nepal main job ke silsile main aae the
 Habib had sent a selfie after his family came to Nepal to agree to his family
 unhone kaha tha ki vah surakshit nepal pahunch gaye hai
 Habib flew from Lahore in Pakistan to Kathmandu in Nepal
 iske baad vah bhartiyaborderspar sthit buddhasthal lubanni gaye the
 He has no address since

 When he made fun of the discovery of the gold treasure in Daundia Kheda, Uttar Pradesh, everyone praised his modern thoughts
 unka yah kahana ki vahaan khudaai karake sarkaar ne desh kii jagahansai kii he, taarkik tha
 His statement made it seem that he did not believe in the orthodoxism and the dialogue of the saints and pundits, but now suddenly he changed the tone
 ab modi ne yah kaha, 'shobhan sarkaar aise sant hai jinke prati lakhon logon kii aasthaa judi hui he or main unki tapasya or tyaag ko pranaam karata hum
 This change in his statements is astonishing and it seems that he has come under pressure from orthodox elements
 yaa phir yah ho saktaa he ki unka pehle vaala bayaan kisi or kaaran se diya gaya ho
 However, it is very strange for a person claiming the position of Prime Minister to change his stand in this way
 yah unke vyaktitv se mail nahin khaataa he
 If he wants to become the leader of the youth of the country and establish himself as his ideal, then he has to stay away from the orthodox ideas that he had earlier

 trump kitna jhooth bolte hai, iskaa hisaab rakhane vaala bhi khalihar hoga
 The Washington Post office must have been placed on a stool to count how much the President lies
 ab usne gin diya he ki ab tak kaarykaal main 8,158 jhooth or bhraamak bayaan de chuke hai
 This news has been published worldwide
 kisi ne sochaa nahin ki isse jhooth par kitna asar padegaa
 i am not at all concerned about India
 mujhe yakeen he ki yahaan jhooth bolne kii pratiyogita chal padegi or koi na koi banda aisa hoga jo trump ko haraane kii thaan legaa
 How can it be that we cannot lie more than trumps
 ek din bol kar dikhaa dena he
 Only then will we have an official name in the world
 aise to naam he hi
 The Washington Post news has disappointed me
 jhooth bolne kaa mazaa hi yahi he ki hisaab nahin rakhana padataa he
 Neither the hearer should keep an account
 ab koi ginana shuru kar de to aadmi ke liye bolnaa mushkil ho jaae
 The leader will not be able to speak anything in public
 tali bajaane kii jagah public 1001, 1002,1003 chillane lagegi
 The leader will come out in public without speaking and will shake hands
 trump se pehle bhi netaa jhooth bol gaye hai
 But they are not counted
 mujhe lagata he ki jhooth ginaney kaa makasad hi yahi he ki netaaon ko chup kara diya jaae
 Truth has always been lacking
 satya bolne main jhanjhat bhi bahut he
 One is the big people are worried about what is the truth
 kuch to itane pareshaan hue ki ghar-parivaar chhod jangal main chale gaye
 Some worked in the war by asking their friends
 hameshaa duusare gyani se poochna padataa he
 Truth is not a matter of everyone
 satya ke liye sadhana chahie
 Time for spiritual practice
 time to trephic jam main hi khallaas ho jaataa he
 Therefore, it is okay to lie in today's life
 ve koun si shaktiyaan hai jo chaahati hai ki trump satya ke jhanjhat main pad jaaen to isaki talash main apana vakt barbaad kar den
 i like Trump's point that he, like ordinary citizens, is lying even after becoming President
 raashtrapati logon ko jhooth kii zarurat nahin hoti magar ve bol rahe hai
 i am sure that Trump must have been the best friend in school life too because of the art of lying
 hameshaa chuttee ke liye nae-nae bahaane gadhate honge
 Will be helping friends
 pet karaab se lekar daadi biimaar tak boring bahaanon se kahin zyaada shandaar bahaane banaate honge
 Today, the value of lies has increased because of them, otherwise people did not even remember
 mujhe garv he ki trump jhooth bolne kii kshamta main sudhaar karte ja rahe hai
 If there is anything to be done for the country, then something has to be done for the first lie
 apane kaarykaal ke pehle saal main har din 5
 6 used to lie
 duusare saal main ve 16
 5 lies telling everyday
 sochie ki unka mind kitna creative hoga
 It becomes difficult to tell a lie
 ve har rose 16
 5 lies
 vaav! trump ne white house ko safed jhooth main badla he
 This is a big deal
 main nahin chahta ki koi trump kii barabari kar le
 Rather i pray that Trump tells up to 20 lies every day
 balki ek din main 24 ghante hote hai to kam se kam 24 jhooth zarur bolen
 Well in India, no lie is counting
 agar bharat ko america kii barabari kerani he to use jhooth ko mukt karnaa hoga
 Reform 2 therein
 0 laana hoga
 So that one does not have to undergo a fact-check to lie
 bharat main jo log bhi prayaas kar rahe hai, unhen shubhakamanaayen
 i have not named anyone
 isliye coment baks main gaali dekar duniya ko yah pataa na chalane den ki jhooth bolne kaa ishaara kiski taraf kiya gaya he
 Trump said in the first 100 days of his tenure that he was liberal about lies
 kuch na kuch alag karenge
 Trump knew his lies were being counted
 iske baad bhi unhone jhooth kaa saath nahin choda
 In India too, people are trying to match the trump
 chunki bharat main kisi chiz kii file hoti nahin hai, gaayab ho jaati he isliye sahi aankade nahin hai
 When there is no job data, where will the false figures be found? kaash bharat main bhi gina jaataa to aaj duniya ke saamne trump kii jagah hamaare netaaon kii charchaa ho rahi hoti he
 8,158 lies are also something to tell
 ham log apane netaaon ke jhooth gin den to trump sahab satya bolnaa shuru kar denge
 They know that the leaders of India can do anything, they cannot speak the truth
 hamaare netaa satya bolne ke liye shahar nahin aate, jangal jate hai
 Go there and find the truth in solitude
 khushi kii baat he ki aaj bhi netaa jangal jate hai

 In June this year, Devendra Fadnavis appeared to be more of a terminator than a chief minister
 ve vipaksh ke aaropon kaa jawaab de rahe the ki ve sabhi morchon par vifal rahe hai
 It was the last day of the assembly session in June and Fadnavis was full of confidence
 ve aashwast the ki 1972 main divangat vasantrao nik ke baad kaarykaal puraa karne vaale rajya ke pehle mukhyamantri honge
 On 24 October, Fadnavis made history for the second time
 ab ve rajya ke 59 saal ke itihaas main pehle gaiyr-congressi mukhyamantri hai jinhone satta main vaapasi kii he
 In October 2014, he was elected to lead the state, replacing party veterans like Nitin Gadkari and Eknath Khadse
 24 aktubar ko aae parinaam bataate hai ki party 2014 kii tulana main 17 siten kam bhale jiti lekin ve nirvivaad netaa rahe
 Fadnavis has made a comeback, but in a changed political scenario
 bhaajapa kii jeet bataati he ki matadaata use ek or mauka dene ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin ek shart ke saath
 Fadnavis will have to deal with an ally Shiv Sena, which captured its fourth best by capturing 56 seats
 pehle hi, shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare apni mahatvakankshaayen jaahir kar chuke hai
 In a press conference on Thursday, when the results were coming, he said that the coalition will not claim to form a government until the formula for the sharing of power is decided
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ''ham satta main 50-50 kii saajhedaari chaahate hai
 Meanwhile, Fadnavis avoided confronting Thackeray
 unhone daawa kiya ki satta ke bantwaare kaa formula to pehle se hi tay kiya ja chukaa he
 "we will disclose it at the right time," he said
 ''vipaksh kaa pradarshan bhi bahut bura nahin rahaa
 It was being said that Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is ending now but it won 13 more seats than in 2014
 congress ne bhi 44 siten jeetin, jo pichley chunaav se do adhik hai
 For a desperate and leaderless party, this performance would be considered extraordinary
 yaad dilaate chalem ki party kii mumbai ikai main ghamaasan bahut zyada he
 The party seemed to be on the verge of collapse, with many leaders willing to change sides
 mumbai congress ke purv adhyakshon main se, kripashankar singh ne party chhod di he jabaki sanjay nirupam ne tikat vitaran kii khulkar aalochana kii thi
 Despite the number of seats reduced, Fadnavis' victory is impressive because he belongs to a caste caste which has a very small number
 shaktishaalee maratha unke khilaaf the or rajya ke adhikansh varisht bhaajapa netaa unki kaaryastylee se naakhush the
 The BJP and Shiv Sena had won 41 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state in May 2019
 bhaajapa-shivasena gathbandhan ne rajya kii 227 vidhansabha siton par badhat banaai thi
 So, what happened in six months? Why Fadnavis could not repeat the party's 2014 performance? a major reason was the government's failure to deal with floods in western Maharashtra including Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara in july-august this year
 yah vah kshetra he jahaan rakanpa ne sarvaadhik siten (28) jiti hai
 At least 50 people died in the floods, but the government machinery was quick to deal with the situation
 is sankat ke pehle do dinon main to sarkaar kahin najar bhi nahin aa rahi thi
 In fact, Fadnavis was on a statewide grand mandate visit at that time
 sharad pavaar par idi kaa shikanja kasne kii bhaajapa kii chaal, vah bhi keval ek nijee shikaayat par, ulti pad gai
 This created a sympathy wave for Pawar who arrived in the seventies of life
 unhone chaturaai se iske jariye maraathon ke bich apana aadhaar majboot kar liya or rakanpa 54 siten jeet gai
 The BJP had 35 leaders of Congress and NCP in its ranks but this did not improve the performance of the party; Only 16 of them won
 rakanpa ke pradarshan ne congress ke saath uske vilay kii atakalon par kam se kam philhal ke liye to viraam hi laga diya he
 On the day of the results, Pawar denied any alliance with the Shiv Sena and the NCP is now the largest opposition party in the state
 pavaar ke rajnatik uttaradhikari kaa mudda bhi karajat-jamkhed se unke pote rohit kii jeet ke saath sulajh gaya he
 However, it will be interesting to see if Pawar chooses nephew Ajit or OBC leader Dhananjay Munde as Leader of the Opposition, who has achieved great success by defeating his cousin and woman and child welfare minister Pankaja Munde in Parli
 fadanvis bhaajapa main ekmaatr netaa the, jo chunaav main shivasena ko saath lenaa chaahate the
 His wish is now fulfilled, he must unexpectedly manage the dominating ally
 56 siton ke saath shivasena 2014 ke apane 64 siton ke aankade ke kareeb he jabaki bhaajapa ne 17 siten ganvaai hai
 Uddhav Thackeray will leave no stone unturned to dominate
 shivasena netaa anil desai kaa kahana he ki party fadanvis se ummid karti he ki ve satta main 50 pratishat hissedari dene kaa apana vaada puraa karenge
 There is every possibility that Thackeray will bargain hard to get important portfolios for his people
 ve 10 rupye main dopaher ke bhojan, kisaanon ko 10,000 rupye ke vaarshik bhatte, konkan main rasinic rifinary ko band karne or mumbai main tateey sadak pariyojna, jis par is varsh hycourt ne roak laga di thi, jaise vaadon ko puraa karaane par jor denge
 Fadnavis is eyeing 13 rebels of the bjp-shiv Sena along with two allies who have won the Independents and become mlas
 ve kehete hai, ''maine un sabhi se sampark kiya he
 However, Thackeray will have to worry if the Shiv Sena loses in his stronghold Mumbai
 bandra (purv), jahaan thakare rahete hai, main mumbai ke meyar vishwanath mahadeshwar congress ke jishaan siddiki se haar gaye
 It will be interesting to see if Thackeray decides to include son Aditya in the cabinet or gives him time to 'know the affairs of the legislature' before accepting any responsibility
 ek baat saaf he—aditya up-mukhyamantri nahin banenge, jisaki ummid kuch shivasena netaaon ne sambhaavna jataai thi
 In the next five years the focus will be on Fadnavis
 unki jeet kaa maheen antar vastav main unke paksh main kaam kar saktaa he
 Before the elections, the party leaders had started to say to Dabi that if the BJP wins a spectacular victory in the state, Fadnavis will be sent to Delhi
 tark yah tha ki rajya ko to koi bhi chalaa saktaa he
 However, Fadnavis will have to remain in Maharashtra as the margin of victory for the alliance decreases
 congress kii vaapasi bhi unke liye koi kam chintaa vaali baat nahin he
 Despite several successive defeats, the party consolidated its position in the state, followed by the victory of local satraps like Vijay, known as Balasaheb Thorat, and Ashok Chavan
 maharashtra congress ke pravaktaa sachin saavant ne sweekaar kiya ki unhen is baat par aatmachintan karne kii aavashyaktaa he ki ve logon kaa dil kyon nahin jeet sakate
 However, he says that the election results have added "new energy" to the party
 party ne rajya main apana pradarshan sudhara he to is baat kii bhi ummid he ki milind devda or sanjay nirupam jaise netaaon ke paala badalane par bhi roak lag jaaegi
 a reshuffle is also possible in the state Congress to give preference to the youth
 pichley kuch hafte fadanvis ke liye bahut utsaahpurn rahe kyonki media rajya main unki prachand jeet kii bhavishyavaaniyan karata aa rahaa tha
 But some of the ensuing weeks will be challenging for him as his ability will be tested during this time
 vaise, is yuva mukhyamantri ke liye pareshaaniyaan koi nai baat nahin he
 When the party decided to contest the 2014 elections without the face of the Chief Minister, Fadnavis was not even ahead in the race for the post
 party kaa mul sanghathan aresas bhi maratha bahul rajya main unki sweekaaryata ko lekar andeh jataa rahaa tha
 Till then, ten of the 17 chief ministers of the state were from the Maratha community
 fadanvis brahman hai or rajya ke pichde vidarbha kshetra se hai
 There is a story behind how he was selected for the post
 ve 2014 main rajya bhaajapa ke adhyaksh the
 During the Lok Sabha elections, Modi was impressed by his style of campaigning
 divangat gopinath munde sahit bhaajapa ke sabhi varisht netaa maharashtra main bhaajapa-shivasena gathbandhan ke liye 35 loksabhaa siton kii bhavishyavaanee kar rahe the, us samay fadanvis ne bade aatmavishvaas ke saath kaha tha ki gathbandhan 41 siten jitegaa
 His assessment was proved correct
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan mukhyamantri ke grihnagar kii ek raily main kaha tha, ''nagpur kaa devendra fadanvis ke rup main desh ko diya sabase keemtee uphaar he
 Then Fadnavis realized that he could be the next chief minister
 maharashtra par shashan karnaa kabhi aasaan nahin rahaa
 The state with 48 Lok Sabha seats, comes second after Uttar Pradesh with 80 seats
 desh ke utpaadan kshetra kii 13 pratishat or seva kshetra kii 17 pratishat hissedari ke saath yah desh kaa sabase audyogikrut rajya he
 Since Vasantrao Naik, every chief minister of the state has been seen struggling to run this state
 shankarrav chavaan, vasantdada patil, sharad pavaar or sudhakararav nik ko chhodkar mukhyamantri kii kursi par baithe har vyakti ko bhrashtachar ke aaropon yaa aakshamata ke kaaran kursi chhodmai padi (chavaan or pavaar ne centre main mantri banane ke kaaran mukhyamantri kaa pad choda)
 Five years were not easy for Fadnavis
 kisaanon, maraathon or koregaanv-bhima main daliton par hamalaa, teen bade andolanon main unke rajnatik kaushal kii pariksha hui
 Fadnavis says that he has become a patient listener in order to deal with these issues
 unki sarkaar kaa ahm mode 2016 ke aakhri maheenon main rajya main prabhavi maratha samudaay kaa aarakshan andolan tha
 The Maratha community organized 57 big marches in the state, in which thousands of people participated
 unka kahana tha ki samudaay kii girti saakh ko behaal karne kaa iklauta tarika sarkari naukariyon or shiksha main aarakshan he
 Opponents of Fadnavis started raising their voices in the party as well
 party adhyaksh amit shah samet kai netaa unhen badalane par vichaar karne lage
 The troubled Fadnavis did not lose his temper
 unhone maratha samudaay ke netaaon ke saath pichley daravaaje se baatcheet shuru kii or samudaay ko aarakshan ke daayre main laane kii aupchaariktaaon ko tej kar diya
 He says, "I learned that the fruit of endurance is sweet
 ''fadanvis ne sust pade maharashtra pichhadaa varg ayog kaa punargathan kiya, taaki koi bhi kanoonee pahal vaid ho
 When the Commission declared the Maratha community as socially and economically backward, the Chief Minister passed the bill giving 16 percent reservation to it in the Assembly on June 27, 2019
 hycourt ne ise ghataakar sarkari naukariyon main 13 fisad or shiksha sansthaanon 12 fisad kar diya
 Nevertheless it was a big win for Fadnavis
 yah bhi unke paksh main gaya ki ve obisi ke liye 23 fisad aarakshan ko barkaraar rakh paae
 The second major setback was farmers' movements
 march 2018 main upaj kii behatar keemat kii maang lekar kisaan sadak par utar aae
 The state was in the grip of drought for the third consecutive year
 fadanvis ne vampanthi rujhaan vaale kisaan netaa ajit navale ko baatcheet ke liye bulaayaa or andolan multavee karne ke liye raji kar liya
 His move surprised everyone
 baad main aktubar 2018 main fadanvis ne chhatrapati shivaji maharaj shetakari sammaan yojana ke tahat 1
 5 lakhs
 tak ke karj maaf karne kaa elaan kiya
 His initiative to link debt waiver with Aadhaar brought transparency and helped in the identification of fake and 'fake' accounts
 lihaaja, vaastavik labhaarthiyon kii sankhya 89 lakh se ghatakar 52 lakh ho gai
 The total amount of farmer loan waiver is also Rs 32,000 crore
 se ghatakar 22,000 karod ru
 Arrived at haalanki rakanpa pramukh pavaar isse sahamat nahin hai or chunaav ke nateezon se yah sabit bhi hua
 In a conversation with India Today before the assembly elections, Pawar said, "fadnavis' biggest achievement in the last five years has been the farmer crisis and the industrial recession
" '' sabase zyada kisaan aatmahatya kii vaardaat vaale vidarbha ilaake main bhaajapa 17 siten haar gai, jo usne 2014 main jiti thim
 The koregaon-bhima violence on January 1, 2018 may have also influenced the results
 us hinsa se maharashtra ke saamaajik tanebane par hi khatra mandaraane laga tha
 Although the police initially termed Hindutva leader, Sambhaji Bhide, the president of Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan, as the prime suspect but later it was called a Maoist conspiracy
 vidhansabha chunaavon main apekshaakrit kam faasale kii jeet ke baavjood party main fadanvis kii sthiti majboot hogi
 One reason is that only a few of his rivals have survived in the state
 unke sabhi virodhiyon ko tikat dene se inkaar kar diya gaya tha
 From the outspoken Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse to Higher Education Minister Vinod Tawde and senior party leader Prakash Mehta, Raj Purohit is all out
 ek or pratidwandvi pankaja munde bhi parali se haar kar baahar ho gai hai
 Team Fadnavis now has loyalists such as Water Resources Minister Girish Mahajan, Food and Drug Administration Minister Jayakumar Rawal, Labor Minister Sambhaji patil-nilangekar and OBC Affairs Minister Sanjay Kute (see Team Fadnavis)
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki fadanvis shivasena ko kaise sadhate hai kyonki unke pehle kaarykaal ke zyaadaatar samay donon ke rishte tufaani bane rahe hai
 The major challenges for Fadnavis will be water from rising unemployment, social security and water crisis
 centre for monitering indian iconomi (siemii) kii report main maharashtra main is saal sitambar main berogari dar 5
 7 percent is estimated
 teen saal ke lagaataar sookhe ke baad is saal rajya main ausat barsaat 99 fisad aanki gai he
 The state still remains an industrial powerhouse
 fadanvis kaa daawa he ki maharashtra ko pichley do saal main desh main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadi) kaa 35 fisad hasil hua he
 The rate of converting mous into actual projects for investment in the state is 40 percent
 fadanvis ko sabit karnaa hoga ki ve kaamkaaj ke prati gambhir hai
 There is also a long shadow of the failed Foxconn deal
 taiwan kii phone nirmaataa company ne 2015 main 5 arab dollar ke nivesh kaa elaan kiya tha lekin shart yah thi ki use mumbai ke paas jameen or 30 fisad kar riyaayat deni hogi
 Fadnavis could not fulfill the condition and the company moved the project outside the state
 fadanvis ne mumbai metro, nagpur-mumbai super communication hive, navi mumbai airport, trans harbar link jaisi badi infrastracchar pariyojnaayen haath main le rakhi hai
 The Trans Harbor Link will connect Mumbai with nabha-sheva
 ye pariyojnaayen kareeb 3 lakh karod ru
 And they are to be completed before 2024
 trans harbar link abhi bhi kaagajon par he
 Its tender has not even been released yet
 unke duusare bade vaade bhi hai
 For example, the 212 meter high monument of Chhatrapati Shivaji in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Mumbai and Dr
 Indu Mill Complex in Dadar

 The promises and claims are indeed high
 *** Railway employees will get 78 days salary as Diwali bonus for 2013-14
 yah pichley do saal se die ja rahe bonus ke baraabar he
 This decision has been taken despite the poor financial condition of the Railways
 rail mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne isaki jaankaree dete hue kaha ki rail karmchaariyon ko 2013-14 ke liye utpaadakta-sambhddha bonus (pielbi) ke rup main 78 din kaa vetan dene kaa nirnay kiya gaya he
 In the years 2011-12 and 2012-13 also, railway employees were paid 78 days' salary as PLB
 railway karmchaariyon ko har saal utpaadakta aadhaarit bonus diya jaataa he or isse 11 lakh se adhik gaiyr-rajpatrit rail karmchaaree labhanvit honge
 The bonus payment will cost the Railways Rs 800 crore
 railway ne haalanki, bonus ke liye aadesh jari kar diya he, lekin is par abhi mantrimandal se manjuuri lee jaani he
 According to officials, Railway Minister Sadanand Gowda could not seek Cabinet approval on the PLB proposal due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley being in the hospital
 adhikari ne kaha, faisle par mantrimandal kii manjuuri baad main lee jaaegi
 The order was first issued due to time constraints
 haalanki, ol india railwamen federation ke mahasachiv shivagopal mishra ne kaha, relkarmiyon ko zyada bonus milanaa chahie tha, kyonki pichley saal se is saal utpaadan badha he
 He said that each eligible employee would get a bonus of Rs 8,975 and about 11 this year
 5 lakh karmchaariyon ko yah milegaa
 The threat of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) returning to power in Gujarat is also heard in Bihar politics
 raajnneetik dal is par khulkar kuch bhi bolne se batch rahe hai, lekin aamtaur par kisi kii bhi jeet par badhai dene vaale bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ab tak mukhyamantri narendra modi badhai nahin di he
 While a constituent in the ruling coalition in Bihar, the BJP is rejoicing over Modi's victory, the leaders of the Janata Dal (united), the other constituent of the government, are refraining from openly reacting to it
 aisa nahin ki modi ko lekar bijepi or jad (yu) koi pehali baar aamane-saamne najar aa rahe hai
 In many cases, JD (U) leaders were uncomfortable with Modi
 jeet kaa jashn manaa rahe bihar ke ek varisht mantri or bijepi netaa giriraaj singh kehete hai ki purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke baad modi ek jananetaa ke rup main ubhare hai
 The party has to decide who will be the prime ministerial candidate in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 lekin unka maananaa he ki modi ko bhavi pradhanmantri ke rup main pesh kiya janaa chahie
 He said that till now the politics of dynasty, regionalism and communalism has been happening in the country and Modi has created a history of new politics in the meantime
 vaise jad (yu) ke netaa gujarat ke chunaav parinaamon ko lekar kuch zyada nahin bol rahe hai
 But he has definitely said that the result of Gujarat will not have any effect in the politics of Bihar
 jad (yu) kii bihar ikai ke adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh kehete hai ki gujarat ke parinaam kaa rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) par koi asar nahin padegaa
 He said that due to elections in any state of the country, it does not affect any other state
 idhar jad (yu) ke pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane ke vishay main poochne par kaha ki is maamle par party pehle hi apni sthiti spasht kar chuki he
 He said that the party has already said that the NDA should declare such a person as a candidate who is secular and on which it still stands
 vaise raajnneetik vishleshak maanate hai ki gujarat ke parinaam kaa asar bihar main turant nahin dikhegaa, lekin bhavishya main iskaa asar jarur dikhegaa
 Politician Surendra Kishore said that in the present time, the result of Gujarat will not have any effect on Bihar, but if BJP presents Modi as Prime Minister then there will be a danger of coalition breakdown in Bihar
 jiskaa asar bhavishya ke chunaavon par padegaa
 He said that JD (U) believes that the Muslim vote is with him, and he would not like to offend Muslim voters only with Modi
 aise main gathbandhan par asar padegaa
 However, Kishore says that its impact will emerge before the Lok Sabha elections
 ullekhneey he ki modi ke naam par kai baar bijepi or jad (yu) aamane-saamne aa chuke hai
 During the last assembly elections, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar openly opposed Modi's campaign to come to Bihar
 iske pehle 2010 main bhi nitish ne bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak ke dauraan samachar patron main prakashit ek vigyaapan main modi ke saath unki tasviir prakashit kiye jane par aapatti vyakt kii thi

 Explain that there was violence in Kasganj on 26 January, in which a young man named Chandan Gupta died after being shot
 jiske baad kasganj ke halaat kaaphi bigade the
 Recently in the Rajya Sabha also, SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav raised this issue
 shuukravaar ko rajyasabha main samaajawaadee party ke netaa ramgopal yadav ne rajyasabha main kasganj kaa mudda uthaate hue kaha ki alpsankhyakon ke gharon ko todaa ja rahaa he
 Entering into the house and being arrested, everyone knows that the one who killed is non-muslim
 ramgopal bole ki rajya sarkaar ekatarfa karrwai kar rahi he, yah thik nahin he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement on the issue of shame on the issue of shame has reached the house in the Parliament too, 'pakoda employment', Shah said - not making fun
 somvaar ko bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh or saansad amit shah ne rajyasabha main apana pehla bhaashan diya
 During this time, he supported PM Modi's statement about employment and advised the Congress not to make fun of him

 Chidambaram has targeted the Modi government of the Center by writing an article in a popular English newspaper
 unhone news agency eenai ko haal main die pradhanmantri narendra ke intervyuu kaa hawala dete huue sarkaar par kai sawaal uthaae hai
 Issues like demonetisation, GST, surgical strikes, lynchings, resignation of RBI governor, Sabarimala, triple talaq bill, Rafael deal and debt waiver have come up prominently
 trishanku nahin, nirnaayak janadeshchidambaram ne lekh ke shuru main hi likhaa he ki pradhanmantri modi ne apane intervyuu main kaha ki 'telugana or mizoram main logon ne bijepi ko chance nahin diya jabaki chhattisgarh main bijepi ke khilaaf spasht janadesh mila
 In Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, there was a hung assembly situation
 ' iske jawaab main chidambaram ne likhaa he ki mizoram or telugana ko chhod baaki ke teen rajyon main congress ko nirnaayak janadesh mila or vahaan trishanku vaali koi baat nahin thi
 The BJP lost 34 seats (49 to 15) in Chhattisgarh, 56 (165 to 109) in Madhya Pradesh and 90 (163 to 73) seats in Rajasthan
 ise bijepi ke khilaaf nirnaayak janadesh kahenge
 Therefore, very few people would consider Narendra Modi's deliberations
 chidambaramane isi kram main aresas kaa bhi zikr kiya or kaha ki paanch rajyon kii haar ko sangh samaj gaya he isliye hindutv kaa mudda uchhaalkarram mandirke liye adhyadesh kii maang ho rahi he, jabaki maamla supreme court main he
 Raising issues like PM Modinotbandi, GST, surgical strikes, lynchings, resignation of RBI governor, Sabarimala, triple talaq bill, Rafael deal and debt waiver, Chidambaram said that the government had made huge mistakes in the past but the Prime Minister did not accept his mistake
 Not willing to accept chidambaram ke mutabik,notebandiab tak kii sabase badi galati thi, jiesti ko galat tareeke se lagu karne ke kaaran yah badtar haalat main he, sargical strike koi khaas ghatana nahin thi kyonki isse aatankwaad or ghuspaith par roak nahin lag pai, teen talaak bill puri tarah se pakshpaati he,rafelsaude ne air force or hindustan aronotical limited kii baat nahin suni or galat nitiyon ke kaaran kisaanon kii karjamaafee ab anivaary ban gai he
 Chidambaram further said, 'there are some issues on which the Prime Minister is not talking
 jaise-berogari, kisaanon kii hataasha or aatmahatya, mahila suraksha, nigaraanee dal, logon main asantosh, jammu-kashmir, arthvyavastha, bandi ke kagaar par kutir udyog, thahari pariyojnaayen, diwalia companiyaan, vittiya ghate kaa pichhadaa target or sarkaar se bhaagate namchin arthshaastri
 'jidambaram further said,' The Prime Minister does not say anything about further, just picks up the past
 logon kii dasha kaise sudhare,arthvyavasthaapatari par kaise laute, is bare main ve kuch nahin bolte
 Fail is written on every page of his report card
 'chunaavon se pehle ye karegi sarkaarchidambaram ne likhaa he ki logon ke bich ab yah dharna banaai ja rahi he ki bada badlaav hone vaala he
 There is talk of interest-free crop loans and small-scale farmers' Kokash transfer
 sarkaar agar kisaanon ko karj dene ke liye bainkon se kahe bhi to cash transfar ke liye paisa kahaan se aayega
 The fiscal deficit November 2018 has reached 115 percent of its target
 itnaa kuch ke baavjood hataash sarkaar kuch raahaton kaa elaan kar sakati he
 Distracted by issues, this government can also bring a mandate for the construction of Ram temple, which would be contempt of court
 haalanki chunaav se mahaj 10 hafte pehle sarkaar ke har aise kadam ko janata baariki se dekh rahi he, parakh rahi he
 So it is not so easy to remove the word 'fail' written on the report card

 lihaaja test kii pehali pari main jab clark ballebaaji ke liye utre to puure ovel maidan main maujuud darshak unke sammaan main khadey ho gaye
 Clarke reached the crease after Gord of Honor until he was dismissed before he could get out
 vah pehali hi gend ko leg slip par khel kar krij se baahar nikal aae the, wo to thro wicket par nahin laga varanaa ve out hi the
 However, even after this, he could not last long on the wicket
 ve mahaj 15 ran banaakar pavilion laut gaye
 Throughout this series, Clarke was seen struggling with the bat
 kariyar ke 115 wein test ke dauraan clark kii ballebaaji kaa ausat 49 se zyada kaa he lekin is series ke dauraan ve mahaj 17 ke ausat se ran bana paae
 However, shortly before the start of the Test, Clarke has described this match as Test of Corrector
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki duusari pari main ve balle se yaadgaar pradarshan kar pate hai yaa nahi?tippaniyan His team, on the other hand, did not allow England's fast bowlers to dominate the Havve in the Oval Test
 david warranar or steven smith ne australia kii pehali pari ko majboot sthiti main pahunchaa diya
 However, Clarke's own intention would be to strike a bat in the second innings against England
 ve apane kariyar kii antim pari ko yaadgaar or khaas banane kaa koi kasar nahin chhodana chahenge
 So when Clarke came out to bat in the first innings of the Test, the spectators present at the entire Oval ground stood in his honor
 gord ofonor ke baad krij tak pahunche clark jab tak sanbhalte usase pehle out hote-hote bache
 He came out of the crease playing the first ball at leg slip, he did not hit the throw wicket or else he was out
 haalanki iske baad bhi ve wicket par lambey samay tak tik nahin paae
 He returned to the pavilion after scoring just 15 runs
 is puri siries ke dauraan clark balle se sangharsh karte najar aae
 Clarke's batting average is more than 49 during his 115th Test career, but during this series he was able to score at an average of just 17
 haalanki test shuru hone se kuch samay pehle hi clark ne is mukaable ko test of karactor bataaya he
 In such a situation, it is to be seen whether they are able to perform memorable with the bat in the second innings
 duusari ore unki team ne ovel test main england ke tej gedbaajon ke hauvve ko haaavee hone kaa mauka nahin diya
 David Warrner and Steven Smith put Australia's first innings in a strong position
 vaise clark kaa khud kaa iraadaa igland ke khilof duusari pari main balle se dhamal machaane kaa hoga
 He would like to leave no stone unturned to make the last innings of his career memorable and special

 ) haal hi main dilli se rajyasabha ke liye ummidavaaron ko chunane vaali aam aadmi party ek baar phir vivaadon main ulajh gai he
 Opponents have got a new opportunity to attack the Kejriwal government, which is going to complete three years of power in February
 sanjay singh, susheel gupta or narayan das gupta kaa sansad janaa tay he
 However, many questions are also being raised about the transparency of the party over the decision of these candidates
 aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal ke ghar 6 flag staff main teen janvari ko 11 baje se hi vidhayakon ke aane kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya tha
 One of the objectives of the meeting is to get the mlas exposed to the faces who are going to sit in the Rajya Sabha seat
 vidhayakon kii baithak ke thik baad party kii political afaire cameti kii baithak hui or manish sisodiya ne sanjay singh, narayan das gupta or susheel gupta ke naam par mohar laga di
 Please tell that the Rajya Sabha candidates of Aam Aadmi Party filed nomination on 4 January
 is dauraan ummidavaaron ke halafanaame or bayaan se aisa laga ki sansad jane kii taiyaari teenon netaa pehle hi kar chuke the
 Why is the question of transparency arising, you tell us in a sequential manner, why the question of transparency is finally being raised on the decision of the Political Affairs Committee on 3 January
 1
 The certificate of affidavit submitted during the nomination by Sanjay Singh was prepared at 12:30 pm on the afternoon of 30 December
 2
 The certificate of affidavit filed by Sushil Gupta for nomination states that it was prepared at 3
21 pm on 1 January afternoon
 3
 Only Narayan Das Gupta's affidavit certificate was prepared at 1
48 am on January 3, which is a short time after the meeting of the Political Affairs Committee
 iske alaava haal hi main jab congress netaa ajay maakan ne narayan das gupta kii ummidavaari par sawaal khadey karte hue offis of profit kaa aarope lagaaya toaam aadmi party netaaon nekhud khulaasa kiya ki narayan das gupta 'neshnal pension system trust' ke trustee pad se 29 disambar ko hi istipha de chuke hai
 From the point of resignation, it can be guessed that preparations for Rajya Sabha started long back
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki 20 disambar se lekar 2 janvari tak jab bhiaam aadmi party ke netaonse rajyasabha ummidavaaron ke faisle ke bare main sawaal poocha gaya to har ek netaa ne political afaire cameti kii baithak kaa hawala diya
 Currently, the paper preparations of Sanjay Singh, Sushil Gupta and Narayan Das Gupta, who are going to sit on the Rajya Sabha seat, definitely raise questions on the party's transparent approach
 aapako bataa den ki 3 janvari ko hi political afaire cameti kii baithak ke baad manish sisodiya ne mukhyamantri awaas par press conference ke dauraan kaha tha ki rajyasabha ke liye aam aadmi party ne 18 bade naamon par vichaar or unase sampark kiya tha, lekin sabhi ne rajya sabha jane se inkaar kar diya
 At present, this decision has created controversy within the party, Kumar Vishwas is once again angry but the interesting thing is that Arvind Kejriwal has not yet come forward to convince him

 This time, the BJP is finding it difficult for the BJP to win the last election
 jabaki congress ko apane durg bachaane ke saath-saath apni siton ko badhaane kii jimmedaari hai or sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke liye bhi is ilaake main khaataa kholane kii chunauti he
 Lucknow: Former BJP national president and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has entered the electoral fray for the second time to bear the legacy of Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the capital Lucknow seat

 The three leaders are keeping an eye on the Muslim voters of Lucknow and are trying their best to make them work

 UPA President Sonia Gandhi is in the fray for the fifth time from Rae Bareli seat
 bijepi ne unke khilaaf dinesh pratap singh ko utaara he to sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne congress ke samarthan main apana ummidavaar nahin khadaa kiya he
 BJP has fielded its candidate on the lines of 1996 and 98 on this seat, but it is not easy to beat Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli, because despite the Modi wave in 2014, BJP could not feed Lotus here
 amethi:amethi loksabhaa seat par bhi congress kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he
 Members of the Gandhi family have never lost here
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi chauthi baar amethi seat se chunavi maidan main hai, jahaan unka muqabla bijepi kii smriti irani se he
 The SP-BSP alliance has not fielded its candidate in support of the Congress
 2014 main smriti irani ne rahul gandhi ko kadi takkar dene main kaamyaab raheen thim, lekin amethi main camel nahin khilaa sakin thi
 Despite the defeat, Smriti Irani remained active in Amethi for five years, due to which she is once again presenting a tough challenge to Rahul Gandhi

 Dhaurahra: Jitin Prasad, close to Rahul Gandhi from Dhaurahra, is in the fray once again from the Congress

 In 2014, Rekha Verma of BJP won the victory by defeating Dawood Ahmed of BSP riding on Modi wave
 haalanki is baar daaud jitin prasad ke saath khadey najar aa rahe hai or sap- basapa saath hai
 In such a situation, the battle of Dhaurahra has become triangular
 barabanki:barabanki surakshit seat se congress ke diggaj netaa piel puniya ke bete tanuj puniya chunavi maidan main hai
 Whereas BJP has cut the ticket of its sitting MP Priyanka Rawat and nominated Upendra Rawat, MLA of Zaidpur seat
 vahiin, sapa ne chaar baar saansad rah chuke ram sagar ravat par daanv lagaaya he
 If you look at the political equation of Barabanki, the victory-loss factor is on the Muslim voters of about 25 percent of the population
 aise main sapa or congress donon kii najar muslim maton par he
 Punia is considered to have a good hold in the Muslim community
 aise main agar wo muslim maton ko saadhane main kaamyaab rahete hai to bijepi ke liye is seat par jeet darj karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Fatehpur: BJP holds the Fatehpur MP seat situated between the Ganges and Yamuna river

 From here, bjp's current MP Kaushal Kishore is once again in the fray
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke tahat basapa ne siel verma or congress ne aarake choudhary ko maidan main utaara he

 banda:bundalekhand kii banda loksabhaa seat par bijepi kaa kabja he
 This time the leaders of the three major parties have changed into the electoral fray
 bijepi ne apane maujuuda saansad kaa tikat katkar aarake patel ko utaara he
 While Shyama Charan Gupta from SP and Bal Kumar Patel from Congress are in the election battleground
 2014 main bijepi se bhairo prasad mishra ne aarake patel ko maat dekar saansad chune gaye the, lekin is baar party ne unhen tikat nahin diya he
 RK Patel contested from BSP and Balakumar was from SP
 is baar ye donon netaa bhi apni-apni partiyaan badalakar maidan main hai
 In this way, the battle of Banda is seen to be triangular
 sitapur:sitapur loksabhaa seat par bijepi kaa kabja he
 From here, BJP has once again introduced its current MP Rajesh Verma
 jabaki congress ne kaisar jahaan or basapa ne nakul doobe ko chunavi maidan main utaara he
 This area is considered to be Brahmin, Muslim and Kurmi dominated
 aise main teenon dalon se ummidavaar inhen teenon samudaay ke hai
 The alliance's equations seem to be deteriorating with the landing of Kaiser Jahan

 Former state president Nirmal Khatri from Congress and Anandasen Yadav from SP are candidates

 While Anandsen is the son of former MP Mitrasen Yadav
 aise main ayodhya seat bijepi ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn maani ja rahi he, lekin sapa-basapa gathbandhan or congress se kadi chunauti mil rahi he
 Bahraich: BJP holds the Bahraich reserved Lok Sabha seat
 2014 main bijepi se saansad chuni gai savitribai phule is baar congress se chunavi maidan main utari hai

 28 years have passed since the Union Carbide Gas scandal, considered the worst industrial tragedy in the world, but the waste lying in the carbide complex has not been destroyed till date
 nikat bhavishya main iske niptaan kii koi ummid bhi najar nahin aa rahi he
 Thousands of people have died in this tragedy that has happened only on the night of December 3, 1984, while millions of people are affected

 Politics about tons of waste continues even today
 isko lekar sarkaar dwaara aaj tak kiye gayi sabhi prayaas asafal sabit hue hai
 The matter is currently pending before the court
 gujarat sarkaar ne bhi pallaa jhadaarajya sarkaar dwaara sabase pehle union carbide parisar main pade kachare kaa niptaan gujarat ke ankleshwar main karne kaa nirnay liya gaya tha
 At that time the Gujarat government was also ready for this, but after the agitation by the people of Gujarat, the Gujarat government refused to bring the garbage there
 gujarat main hua tha virodhbataya jaataa he ki jis samay ankleshwar main kachare ko nasht karne kaa nirnay liya gaya tha, us samay vahaan chunaav hone waal the or kuch swayamsevi sanghathanon ne ise lekar virodh pradarshan kiya, to gujarat sarkaar ne kisi bhi bavaal ko taalane ke liye vahaan kachra nasht karne se inkaar kar diya
 In the middle of the state too, after the Gujarat government refused to destroy the garbage, the government decided to destroy the waste at Pithampur in Dhar district of MP and 40 m
 ton kachra vahaan jala bhi diya gaya tha, lekin yah maamla prakaash main aane ke baad yahaan bhi sthaneey raajnneeti shuru ho gayi
 The court also had to intervene after the agitation against the destruction of garbage in Pithampur under the leadership of BJP leader and former Union Minister Vikram Verma
 iske liye bahaanaa banaaya gaya ki pithampur sthit insinirator iske laayak nahin he
 Subsequently, the Supreme Court gave orders to destroy the waste at the DRDO incinerator at Nagpur, but the Pollution Prevention Board of Maharashtra did not allow it and the Maharashtra government also refused to burn waste at Nagpur
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne is nirnay ke khilaaf ek baar phir ucchtam nyaayalay kii sharan lee or nyaayalay ne nagpur sthit insinirator ke nirikshan ke aadesh diye, lekin nyaayalay ko yah bataaya gaya ki vahaan sthit insinirator itani bady maatra main jaharila kachra nasht karne main sakasham nahin he
 The matter was again considered by the government in cold storage to destroy garbage in Kajola, Maharashtra, but the matter went into cold storage due to not being allowed by the Pollution Prevention Board

 gujarat ke amarelli jile ke peepavav port ke state hive par shuukravaar shaam babbar sher kaa ek bada jhund aa gaya
 You can hardly believe it, but we are going to show you some such pictures and videos which you will also see by seeing

 Seeing this view, the car driver made a video of this entire incident

 Till then there was a traffic jam on the highway

 These are seen only in Junagadh, Amreli and Gir Somnath districts
 may 2015 main hui aakhri ginati ke anusaar sheron kii shankhya sirf 523 he
 The Gir forest is spread over 1413 square kilometers and the lions roam in an area of about 22000 square kilometers
 isliye kabhi-kabhi sher ke jhund raste par bhi aa jate hai
 But this way lions can be a big risk for them to walk on the paths
 bataa den, isse pehle bhi sadak or train durghatnaon main kai sher maare ja chuke hai
 As of last count in May 2015, the number of lions is only 523
 gir kaa jangal 1413 varg kilometre main failaa hua he or sher kareeb 22000 varg kilometre aria main gum rahe hai

 kuraishi ne kaha ki vaarta shuru hone ke liye jaruri he ki najarband kiye gaye kashmiri netaaon ko reeha kiya jaae
 Qureshi, placing a unilateral condition for talks, said that he should be allowed to meet the Kashmiri leadership, so that he could talk to them and then pressurize the Kashmiri leadership to negotiate
 shah mahmud kuraishi kaa ye bayaan haal ke dinon main pakistan kii videsh niti main bada badlaav he
 Prior to this statement, Pakistani rulers had rejected all possibility of a normal relationship with India and were directly and indirectly threatening a nuclear attack

 After going a hundred kilometers from Delhi on the six-lane National Highway-1, take a sharp turn to the right in Panipat, then the path leads to Kairana
 samalkha ke kheton se guzarati choti or sarapat sadak ke donon taraf gehun ke lahalhate khet or gaanvon ke makaan dekhte-dekhte aap yamuna nadi tak pahunch jate hai
 Far from the highway chill-pon, this is a village area in Haryana, where the spreading steps of the cities are clearly visible
 nadi paar karte hi sadak par pehle chote or phir bade-bade khatarnaak gadde hichkole khilaate hai
 The number of houses on both sides of the road keeps increasing and the size gets smaller
 kairana bharat ke sabase zyada aabaadi vaale rajya kaa ek or upekshit konaa he
 Once upon a time, the grocery house here was famous for Hindustani classical music, which people have now forgotten
 pichley saal sitambar main yah tab surkhiyon main aayaa, jab mujffarnagar ke kuch hisson or shamali ke musalamaanon ne apane ilaake main markat or hinsa ke bhay se bhaag kar yahaan ke sharnaarthi shiviron main sharan lee
 There are seven Muslims out of every ten here
 nadi ke us paar samalkha main sakshartaa dar 68 fisadi he, lekin yahaan 29 fisadi rah jaati he
 The neighboring tehsil Samalkha in Haryana has a population of about 30,000, which is one-third of that of Kairana
 chaunde kandhe vaale 21 saal ke noujvaan intjaar khan safed kameez-genes or topi main us noujvaan tabake kii numaaindgi karte hai, jise koi bhi rajnatik dal apane vigyapanon main dikhaanaa chahega
 The only difference is that Khan is not among the 29 per cent of the people who know how to write his name
 pirajdgan muhalle main sadak kinare workshop main scooter mechainic ke kaam se use maheene main 1,500 ru
 Are found vah to aam ke mausam main har saal upi or punjab ke bagichon main gum-gum kar aam todgaye ke kaam se maheene ke 7,000 ru
 The money is earned, otherwise the rotis will also be lost
 khan ne ek baar vidhansabha or ek baar nagarpalika chunaav main vot diya he, lekin yaad nahin he ki kise diya tha
 He does not even know who his MP is
 itnaa jarur maaloom he ki gaanv kii masjid main kuch samajhadaar or bujurg log hai, jinaki raay koi bhi faisla lene se pehle jarur sunani chahie
 One of them is the 38-year-old Samiullah Khan Madrasa Ishatul Islam's Naib
 itani kam umr main bhi samiulla ek tarah se kaum ke netaa ho gaye hai
 They said that when Mayawati forms the government, riots do not happen
 musalmaan mahfuj rahete hai, lekin ve unki khayr-khabar nahin letin
 When Mulayam Singh Yadav comes to government, he does a lot for Muslims, but riots happen
 ham karen to kya karen
 Many Muslims are now sending their children to English schools
 nai nasl apane raste khud chunegi
 At the moment, there are many people who consult Samiullah and his elder brother Barkatullah
 shivi khatm hone ke baad bhi inamen se bahut-se logon ne ghar lautne se manaa kar diya or aise logon kii taadaad bad gai he
 Among these people, 43-year-old Tehsin Qureshi and his brother Mohammad Kalim, 38, do not see any way forward
 donon apni biviyon or chah bacchon tathaa maa ke saath 8 sitambar, 2013 kii raat bahudee gaanv se yahaan aae the
 Neighbors have taken over their house
 bade bhai ne bataaya ki ilaake main tanaav tha
 It was difficult to distinguish rumor and truth, but there was panic
 is parivaar ne shamali ke bahari ilaake main adhbane makaan main panaah lee he
 Qureshi said, "we will not go back
 dangon main sarkaar ne hamase dhokhaa kiya
 Politicians do not consider us humans, only vote banks
 ” The Modi government has completed its first year
 sarkaar kii pehali saalagirah par vitt mantri arun jetali ne aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki 'achche din' sirf naaraa nahin he balki ek prakriya he
 Speaking on the achievements of the government, Jettley said, "the government is insisting on making the system transparent
 ek saal main na to kisi jaanch agency ke durupyog kii baat saamne ai, na faisle lene main deree kii gai
 'arun Jaitley said that the Narendra Modi government is in favor of bringing pension scheme to a society without pension
 jetali ne kaha, 'bharat main 89 fisadi logon ke paas pension kii suvidha nahin he
 Our policy is 'pay less tax, save more'
 34 fisadi tex se sarkaar ko 24 fisadi miltaa he
 89 percent of the population in India does not get pension
 ' jetali ne aage kaha, 'sarkaar system ko paardarshee banane par jor de rahi he
 In one year, there was no report of misuse of any investigating agency, nor was there any delay in taking decisions
 'sushasan ho dilli sarkaar kaa agendadilli ke siem arvind kejariwal or najeeb jang ke bich kikhinchataan parjetli ne kaha, ' sushasan dilli sarkaar kaa agenda hona chahie
 Delhi is not a full state
 lekin dilli sarkaar ke paas kai adhikaar hai
 Jaitley said that the role of the government increases with the opposition
 'kanoon kii kami ke chalate ped news par karrwai sambhav nahin'kendriya soochna prasaaran mantralay ko bhi sanbhaalane vaale arun jetali ne kaha, 'kanoon ke anusaar commercial spich bhi free spich he
 Therefore, action on paid news is not possible
 aise maukon par kamjor kanoon kii vajah se karrwai karne main dikkat hoti he
 "the initiative to stop black money", said Jettley, "the initiative on black money went ahead under the G-20
 2006 ke khate2011 main bataae gaye
 Black money should not be accused
 lagbhag 90 fisadi ke khilaaf prakriya puri kii
 Our government has taken an initiative to stop black money, and has also talked about it with foreign countries
 ' With this, again Arvind Kejriwal questioned why it is that bad machines only show votes in favor of BJP
 vah kharaab nahin he
 Their software has been changed
 chunaav ayog ko unhone chunauti pesh karte hue kaha ki chunaav ayog aisi kharaab kii gai mashin ko hame saunpe ham sabit karenge ki chhedchadi kii gai he

 All efforts are being made to stop ragging in the country, but the ground reality is that ragging is still not completely controlled
 tippaniyan Video of ragging has come out from students in a hostel of Allahabad University
 yahaan rahane gaye chaatro ke saath raging hona aam baat he

 The recession, completing seven years in 2018, has opened India's biggest economic rift
 1991 ke baad pehali baar kisaan or upabhokta aamane-saamne khadey ho gaye hai
 It has never happened in the last 25 years when villages and cities have come face to face like this
 aarthik sudhaaron kii sabase badi safalataa yah thi ki isane gaanv or shahar ke bich rajnatik bantwaare ko sikod diya tha
 Within the first five years of the reforms, the distance between the village and the cities had started to decrease
 donon arthvyavasthaaon ke paas ek duusare ko dene ke liye kuch na kuch tha
 Cities had a growing population and yields near villages
 shaharon ke paas avasar the, gaanvon ke paas shram tha
 Cities had facilities, services, technology, villages had their demand
 sudhaaron ke kareeb dhai dashak baad aaj yah samajha ja saktaa he ki is badlaav ne sarkaron or raajnneeti ko, gaanv or shaharon ko (sadak, mobile, bijli) jodgaye par baadhya kiya na ki baantne par
 In 2006-07, amidst rapid economic growth, the Congress made a partial effort to bring villages to the center of politics through MNREGA
 manaregaa tej aarthik vikaas ke bich ai thi isliye isse ek ore gaanvon main aay badi to duusari ore udyogon ko nai maang mili
 This was the time when a new middle class was created in the villages
 pichley ek dashak main shiksha, chikitsa, sanchaar kii adhikansh nai maang isi gramin or ardhangariya madhya varg se nikali he
 After 2007, the strategies for the rural and town market were at every company's preference
 taaja mandi ne yah santulan bigaad diya
 The recession caught us in 2011-12
 2014 main sarkaar badalte vakt i-commers, share bazaar, hotel or yatra jaise kuch kshetra hi dahaai ke ankon kii raftaar dikhaa rahe the
 Industrial production and building construction was at a standstill, services were also sluggish
 phir bhi 2008 se 2014 ke bich makul mausam, samarthan mulya main badhotaree, nagareey aabaadi kii badhati maang, gaanvon main jameen kii behatar keemat or antarrashtriya bazaar main krishi jinson kii teji ne kheti ko daudaaye rakhaa tha
 In the four years following the 2014 drought, yields deteriorated and prices fell
 pichley 25 saal main aarthik susti ke chote daur aae hai lekin yah pehla sabase lanbaa kalkhand he jabaki arthvyavastha ke sabhi ingine sust yaa band hai
 The biggest dilemma was the government started in 2014 with the resolution that now support prices will not go up because they increase inflation
 bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon par rajnatik chot or sookhe ke kaaran samarthan mulya badhanaa padaa
 When inflation came, import of pulses broke the market prices
 natijatan mandsaur main daal kii keemat maangate kisaanon ko police kii goliyaan milin
 Villages and cities now stand on two poles: the farmer needs the value of his produce
 paidaavaar par 50 fisadi munaafe kaa chunavi vaada (jo tarksangat nahin tha) rajnatik afat he
 Where the government was limiting support prices in 2014, but now there is an attempt to give government prices on vegetables in Haryana, although it is very low
 sarkaron ke bajet isse zyada kii ijaajat nahin dete
 On the other hand, any increase in support price is a feast for inflation
 is saal kii shuruyaat mudrasphi ti ke saath hui he
 Oil prices, budget deficits are all together fueling inflation
 shaharon main bekaari or aay main kami ke bich chunaav ke saal main mahangaai kaa jokhim rajnatik musiibat ban jayega
 Treating the balance between farmer and consumer could have ended foreign investment in the retail market and the Mandi Act, but there is the traditional vote bank of the BJP, which both did not offer very sensitive reforms
 inhen kii ek ghudki main jiesti kaa shirshasana ho gaya
 This is the first time in the last two decades that both farmers and consumers are simultaneously troubled
 donon jagah aay ghati he or avasar kam hue hai
 Now it has become impossible to place both farmer and consumer together on the frame of encouragement
 is saal kaa bajet batayega ki pradhanmantri narendra modi gaanv kii poonch pakad chunavi baitarani utrenge yaa upabhoktaaon ko puchkaar kar siyasat saadhenge
 The divisive politics of village versus city has been brought to the center of the election despite not wanting recession

 It is said that Rakhi's brother and Rituraj got angry after seeing him there
