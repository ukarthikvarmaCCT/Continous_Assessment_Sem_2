sochaa a-polytical kuch kiya jaae
 It should be done in which politics does not come
 chunaav bahut lanbaa ho gaya he
 Reporters are also tired
 kuch reporter baahar se modi-modi nahin pakad paae, laut aae, editor ne bajet kaa hisaab maanga to sar jhukaa liya
 Then other reporters were sent
 unhone zamin par kaan lagaaya
 Heard the under current
 ye change he 2019 kaa
 The current is underground
 lahar kii jagah under karent aa gaya he
 Lu moves up, undercurrent moves down
 to sochaa ki jab raajnneeti, raajnneeti ke mausam main nahin ho rahi he to is mausam main ham raajnneeti se hat jate hai
 Let's do something different
 aam khate hai
 But how to eat mangoes
 dashahari or chausa to chus kar, chaba kar kha lete hai magar malda ko chammach se hi khaaiye
 If you do not understand anything, then white is right
 mangon shaike chalegaa
 i don't like whitewash
 par kya karen
 It is common to feel bad
 raja ke saamne kabhi nahin kahana chahie ki wo mujhe pasand nahin he
 That means white mango
 mango shaike main kya pataa chalata he bheetar koun sa aam he
 The taste of milk, sugar and cherries is known
 bahut hi zyaada cheri daal diya ye to
 If you do not like Mango shake, Mango Lassi also comes
 aam ko ghumaya dikhaaya ki aap yakeen kar len ki aam hi he
 Then remove the skin and cut it so that it comes out of the mouth
 phir kya tha
 Pour curd, mango powder and mango lassi into the mixi
 wo to pine kaa tarika hua, ab aap khaane kaa tarika dekhie
 Don't eat like these people
 vaise mazaa aise hi khaane main aata he
 It seems that mango food is found after big days
 nichod hi liya bechaare aam ko
 Looks like the man is eating the mixer
 mausam kaa gap bhi to ho jaataa he
 If you get after this time, you will feel like eating
 aapako acha lag rahaa he na gaiyr raajnneetik baat
 That's fine isse koi naraj nahin hota he
 Price of mango and mango
 vaise aam kaise khate hai pataa karnaa chahie
 This is the question that should not remain in anyone's mind
 aap soch rahe honge ki main gair raajnneetik baaten kyon kar rahaa hum
 What to do chunaav ke samay jab pradhanmantri gair raajnneetik baaten kar sakate hai
 When they can be creative and be non-political then why can't we be
 pradhanmantri chalanger hai
 It is said in an interview
 logon ne kaha ki aap kumaar ko intervyuu den, ve akshay kumaar ko le aae
 Non political interview
 ye na hota to mausame chunaav main aam kaa zikr na aata
 Once Akbar Allahabadi parceled the mango basket Iqbal to Lahore
 iqbaal ne shukriya ke saath prapti kii khabar bhijwa di
 Akbar was surprised to find the mangoes safe
 akbar ne ek sher likhaa
 The effect is of your anfas-e-messiah 'akbar' elahabaad se langadaa chalaa lahore tak pahunchaa
 Ghalib even wrote Masnavi in praise of mango
 ab uskaa zikr rahane dete hai
 By the way, the common question has given a strong competition to that question of Prasoon Joshi
 prasoon joshi ne kaha tha ki aapmen fakiri kahaan se aati he
 Akshay Kumar knew that he was coming to interview the Prime Minister, not Fakir
 ek vyakti kaa intervyuu karne ja rahe hai
 Still, one must see what the differences between Prasoon Joshi and Akshay Kumar are
 kiske sawaal zyaada raajnneetik hai kiske zyada aadhyatmik hai
 You will decide this
 prasoon ne modi me fakiri dekha to akshay unamem sainik or sanyasi dekhakar kanphyus ho gaye
 Nowadays, if someone does an interview, he gets ripped
 kya akshay kumaar ne koi sawaal miss kiya
 it happens
 aap das sawaal lekar jate hai or do chaar rah jaataa he
 In 2014 a comics named Bal Narendra came out
 meri yaad main pradhanmantri modi pehle netaa hai jinhone chunaav ladate hue apane bare main comics ke zarie apni katha bataai thi
 Later, his story was copied by Kiran Bedi
 unhone bhi comics banavaa lee
 There is an anecdote in Bal Narendra
 modi jab chote the tab vadnagar ke sharmishtha jhil main aksar khilne jaaya karte the
 Once the ball falls into the lake
 baaki bachche dar kar nahin jate hai kyonki usamen magaramchh bhare the
 Bal Narendra is not afraid
 chalaang lagaate hai or gend lekar waapas aa jate hai
 When they are coming back, they see a crocodile and pick up the curiosity
 aage kii kahani he ki magaramchh ke bachche ko lekar ghar le aate hai
 The mother tells them not to separate the mother from the child, if the mother feels sad then the child Narendra leaves the crocodile child back in the lake
 (sanvaidhanik chetavanee ye vaala aap ghar main bilkul tri na karen
 ) In my opinion, Akshay Kumar missed these questions
 thodi or jaankaree milti ki wo kissa kya tha
 There are crocodiles in the lake, which used to go daily, how they did not know
 magaramchh ko uthaa lene par unhen dar nahin laga
 Akshay missed
 par koi nahin
 We also miss
 ankaron ko to sawaal hi yaad nahin aata he saamne jane par
 When do you sleep, you come and ask
 mazaaq alag he
 Thanks for the non-political interview
 hai profile masalon se batch gaya
 By the way read Bal Narendra
 isamen kurte vaali baat he
 Which Akshay has also asked
 kuch javaabon kaa hissaa bal narendra main bhi miltaa he
 As the clothes themselves were cleaned, if there was no iron, they used to press the coal inside the vessel
 vaise raajnneeti ke is ghamaasan main gaiyr raajnneetik kya hota he
 They are candidates
 unki party chunaav maidan main he
 After this, only the Prime Minister can be non-political
 isse charchaa to ho gai
 The interview got space, was supposed to meet anyway
 unka bhaashan ho yaa intervyuu ho, khub dikhaaya jaataa he
 Leaders of the opposition also eat mangoes
 ve bhi bataa sakate the
 If no channel was shown, you could put it on youtube
 matlab akshay kumaar ke intervyuu se problem kyon hai
 Somewhere the Prime Minister tweeted a light-hearted interview of the leaders of the opposition, taking out the old interview
 sach yahi he ki is chunaav main muddon ne namaskara kar liya he
 Issues have moved to Shimla
 isliye hamane tri kiya ki raajnneeti se hat kar kuch kiya jaae
 It was about those elections when people used to talk about issues
 garibi, bhukhmaree, berojgaare
 Slogans were written on the walls
 sabko kaam, sabko naam
 Now suddenly everyone is starting to feel free
 aandhi aati he, sher aata he magar mudda hi nahin aata he
 There has been so much politics that i feel like doing something away from politics
 kisi ko raajnneeti nahin chahie
 Insurance money is not available, no need
 anaaj kaa daam nahin mil rahaa he nahin chahie
 Fees are expensive, will give
 skool vaale or maangenge to or de denge
 Don't want a job
 ham berojgaar rah lenge lekin aap hamen mudda na den
 The country is larger than the issue for voters
 mudda desh se chota hota he
 We will not talk about small things
 badi baaten karenge
 Therefore, move away from politics
 ye chrysis kaaryakarta kaa bhi he
 Work for five years, then suddenly welcome Vijendra or Gautam Gambhir
 pichhali baar jinase haare the is baar unka swaagat karo
 So the worker is also bored with politics
 inkaa kab swaagat karnaa he, kab virodh karnaa he, behad difcult queshchan he
 Therefore, something should be done away from politics

 On the issue of Balochistan, Prime Minister Modi shot such an arrow, in response to which the arrows of the Congress leaders were hit on different targets
 aise main congress kaa asahaj hona laazmi tha, shaam hote-hote congress purv videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ke bayaan se hi pallaa jhaadne ko majaboor ho gai
 Separate statements of Congress leaders In the Rajya Sabha, Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, former Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid and Rajiv Shukla, a minister in the UPA government, gave separate statements on Balochistan
 baluchistan ke mudde par gulam nabi aaazaad ne kanni kaatane kii koshish kii, sidhe jawaab dene ke bajaae unhone kaha ki philhal mudda baluchistan nahin kashmir he, jahaan 37 dinon se karfu laga he
 At the same time, Rajiv Shukla, who was a minister in the UPA government, justified the statement on Prime Minister Cableuchistan, but added that this policy has been the Narasimha Rao government of Congress
 piem PAK par spasht karen apni nitipurv videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki baluchistan kaa zikr karke pradhanmantri modi ne badi bhul kii he, jiskaa khamiyaja bharat ko aane vaale vakt main bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Khurshid said that foreign policy is not a game of Gulli Poles that you shot someone with a stick, apologized and it was over
 pradhanmantri ko ek baar phir se pakistan par apni niti par vichaar karnaa chahie
 It will not work if you ever call Nawaz Sharif in your oath and then suddenly go to Pakistan to meet him and later become an attacker
 jab aapas main hi bhide congressi netabluchistan parcongress party ke netaaon ke alag-alag bayaanke baad maamla tab or bad gaya jab rajeev shukla ne kaha ki baluchistan par modi kaa bayaan vahi he, jo congress ke narsimha raav sarkaar kii line thi
 To this, Salman Khurshid retorted, saying, 'I was the Minister of State for External Affairs at that time, the Government of India had no such line
 jo aisa bolaa he usase maamle kii jaankaree nahin he
 He is lying, this is completely wrong
 'congress ne salmaan ke bayaan se jhaada pallaanetaaon kii bayaanbaji ke baad congress ko laga ki siyaasi taur par salmaan kaa bayaan uske liye nuksaandeh sabit ho saktaa he
 Therefore, after passing some time, Congress media in-charge Randeep Surjewala said in a statement from Chandigarh to Aaj Tak that Salman Khurshid's statement is not the party's statement, it is his personal statement
 kya ho paaegaa damege control?baluchistan parcongress netaaon ke alag-alag sur or aapasi bhidnt ne congress ko baikfoot par dhakel diya he
 The Congress was forced to abstain from the statement of its own former foreign minister, but the Congress strategists themselves are not convinced about the damage done politically
 yahi vajah he ki puure bavaal ke baad ab congress ke netaaon ne is mudde par chuppi saadh lee he

 These rebel mlas, in their petition, have accused the Speaker of the Assembly that they are protecting the minority government
 rohtagi ne jab is yachika par sheeghra sunwaayee ke liye bahut anurodh kiya to peeth ne kaha, ‘‘ham dekhenge
 "the rebel mlas have alleged in the petition," The Congress Party, taking a well-planned course, has filed a petition before the Speaker requesting disqualification of the mlas who have resigned
 yah kahana nirarthak hi he ki ayogyata kii kaarywahi puri tarah gaiyr kanoonee he
 The petition said that the session of the state assembly is scheduled to begin on July 12 and the Speaker has asked the mlas to appear before him personally on the same day, which would indicate the Speaker's intention to disqualify them
 is
 yachika ke anusaar, ‘‘sara makasad hi yachikakartaon ko ayogy qaraar dene tathaa ayogyata kii dhamkee ke tahat sadan main bahumat ke samarthan ke bagaiyr hi alpamat sarkaar ko kaam karne kii anumati dena he
 It is to say that the action of the Speaker is arbitrary and unfair and violates the Constitution
 ''baagi vidhayakon ne aage kaha he ki unke tyaagptr samvidhan ke praavdhaanon or niyamon ke anusaar hi hai
 According to the petition, "there is clearly no need for objection and it seems that this is an attempt to delay the proceedings, thus giving the ruling system an opportunity to pressurize the legislators to resign
" '' vidhayakon ne kaha he ki unke tyaagptr swechha se die gaye hai or sahi hai
 Not only this, he himself has repeatedly requested the Chairman to accept the resignation by giving several television interviews and statements
 yachika main kaha gaya he, ‘‘alpamat main aane ke baavjood mukhyamantri sadan kaa vishwaas mat praapt karne se inkaar kar rahe hai
 The result of the concerted efforts between the Speaker and the government is that such a government which does not have the confidence of the House has illegally remained in power
 ''rajya vidhansabha adhyaksh ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki 14 baagi vidhayakon main se nau ke istife sahi praaroop main nahin the
 The Congress has requested Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar to intervene in the matter and disqualify these mlas
 congress ne bhaajapa par aarope lagaaya he ki vah uske sadasyon ko dhan kaa pralobhan de rahi he
 However, the BJP has denied such allegations
 karnataka vidhansabha ke 13 sadasyon (congress ke 10 or jad- es ke teen) ne chah july ko sadan kii sadsyta se apane-apane tyaagptr vidhansabha adhyaksh ke karyaalay ko saunpe the
 With this, a political crisis had arisen for the congress-jd-s coalition government in the state
 isi bich, congress ke ek anya vidhayak aar roshan beg ne bhi mangalvaar ko istipha de diya
 The Legislative Assembly Speaker has said that of the 14 mlas who resigned, ST Somasekhar, Muniratna, BA Basavaraj, Pratap Gowda Patil, BC Patil, Ramesh Jarkiholi, a Shivamra Habbar, Mahesh Kumatalli, Ramalinga Reddy, Anand Singh and Baig (all Congress ) And Gopalaiah, Narayan Gowda, Adgur H

 '' team india ke mishan world cap ko ek bada jhatka laga he
 'gabbar' Shikhar Dhawan, who won the century innings game against Australia, has been out of the team due to injury
 vah teen hafte ke liye baahar hue hai, lekin unhen fracture he isliye lag rahaa he ki ab worldcup main unki vaapasi mushkil hi he
 There are many questions that have arisen as soon as Dhawan is out, now who will open in the team and then who will play at number four
 aapako bataa den ki shikhar dhawan team se baahar hue hai to ye sawaal khadey ho rahe hai ki opening koun karegaa
 If you look at the team combination, KL Rahul seems to have the highest expectations
 rahul isse pehle bhi opening kar chuke hai, IPL or test cricket main bhi vah opening karte aae hai
 In such a situation, KL Rahul can step down to open with Rohit Sharma in the match against New Zealand on June 13
 abhi rahul chauthe number par khel rahe hai
 But the second big question is that if Rahul opens, then who will play at number four
 abhi tak donon maichon main bharat ne apni team nahin badali he
 In such a situation, Dinesh Karthik, Vijay Shankar and Kedar Jadhav can appear at number four against New Zealand
 kedaar jadhav abhi mahendra singh dhoni ke baad chathe number par khel rahe hai
 Let us know that Vijay Shankar is new in the team, in such a situation, questions can be raised on whether he gets a chance in a big tournament like World Cup
 vahiin, dinesh karthik lambey samay se team main andar baahar hote rahe hai
 However, if it is confirmed that Shikhar is eliminated from the entire tournament
 to BCCI kii ore se unka riplacement bhi maanga ja saktaa he
 In this episode, players like Shreyas Iyer and Rishabh Pant can get a chance if Dhawan is out of the squad
 donon hi khilaadiyon ne IPL or gharelu cricket main acha pradarshan kiya or apni team ko jeet dilaai he
 Let me tell you that in a tournament like World Cup, there is less freedom to choose players out of the squad, in such a situation, this rule can increase the concern of the team
 world cap main ye he puri team

 BJP and Shiv Sena leaders have sharply commented on Vice President Hamid Ansari's statement about insecurity among the Muslims of the country
 bijepi netaaon ne is bayaan ko pad kii garima ke khilaaf bataaya he to shivasena ne isse bhi tikhi tippanee karte hue kaha he ki agar unako muslimon main asuraksha kii bhaavana dikh rahi thi, to pehle hi istipha dekar janata ke bich janaa chahie tha
 Why did not resign? Shiv Sena has reacted strongly to the statement of Vice President Hamid Ansari
 shivasena netaa or rajyasabha saansad sanjay raut ne kaha ki agar hamid ansaari ji ko muslimon main bechaini or asuraksha kii bhaavana dikhti he to is vishay ko lekar unhone pehle hi apane pad se istipha kyon nahin de diya
 Now when he is leaving, then he is giving a statement of this way
 unako pehle hi istipha dekar janata ke bich me janaa chahie
 Sanjay Raut said that majority of Hindus in the country are viewed from the wrong perspective for minority Muslims
 desh kii puri mashinari muslimon kii suraksha main laga di gai he
 What Hamid Ansari has said! Significantly, the outgoing vice-president Hamid Ansari said in an interview that there is a feeling of restlessness and insecurity among the Muslims of the country
 uparashtrapati ke taur par 80 saal ke ansaari kaa doosraa kaarykaal guuruuvaar ko puraa ho rahaa he
 He made this remark at a time when incidents of intolerance and felony attacks by alleged guards have come to light
 hamid ansaari ne kaha ki unhone asahansheeltaa kaa mudda pradhanmantri narendra modi or unke cabinet sahyogiyon ke saamne uthaaya he
 He called it a 'disturbing idea' that the citizenship of Indians was being questioned
 bharat jitani aazaadee kahin or nahimbijapi netaa giriraj singh ne kaha ki puri duniya main bharat ke nagarikon se zyaada koi surakshit nahin he
 He said, 'here anyone can say anything, anyone can support the stone-pellers, anyone can support the separatists
 yahaan aadhi raat ko aatankiyon ke liye court khul sakate hai, isliye bharat main hindu or musalmaan sabhi surakshit hai
 No country like India will be found
 bharat jaisaa abhivyakti kii azaadi vaala desh nahin milegaa
 Abuse anyone in India
 lekin bharat main rahanaa he to kaanoon ek hi hoga
 One law on Ayodhya and another law on triple talaq, it will not work in India
 yah desh samvidhan se chalata habijepi netaa sakshi maharaj ne bhi kaha ki vah hamid ansaari ke bayaan se sahamat nahin hai
 He said, 'there are no Muslims anywhere in India, anywhere in the world
 desh main jabase modi ji pradhanmantri bane hai, koi bhi sampradayik danga nahin hua
 Ever since Yogi ji became the Chief Minister, there has been no riot in UP as well
 haalanki pathar phenkane vaale, bam phenkane vaale aatankwaadi surakshit nahin hai
 It is unfortunate that they (hamid Ansari) have been having fun for three years, when it is time to say farewell to the chair, they have started feeling unsafe by Muslims, nothing can be more bad luck than this
 mujhe lagata he ki ve kisi party kii sadsyta lene vaale hai, isliye is tarah ke bayaan de rahe hai
 This country will run by constitution and not by fatwas and by anyone's views
 pad kii garima ke anukool nahin aise bayanbijepi netaa kailash vijayawargeey ne bhi hamid ansaari ke bayaan se asahmati jataai
 He said, 'I think it is not right to sit at the top post of the country and make such a statement
 main unke bayaan se sahamat nahin hum
 It is not good to assess the basis of three to four events
 aise hazaron udhaaharan mil jaaenge ki hindu-musalmaan milakar ek saath rahete hai
 If you assess the country negatively in this way, then you will not do justice to the country
 lagata he ki is tarah ke bayaan karke wo bhavishya main raajnneetik sambhaawanaaon ko talash rahe hai
 Such light statements cannot be expected from a person sitting at the top post
 is tarah ke bayaan dena sheersh pad kii garima ko giraanaa he
 When Ansari was asked if he had conveyed his concerns to the Prime Minister in an interview on chitaentiv to the Prime Minister, the Vice President responded by saying 'yes'
 sarkaar kii pratikriya puche jane par ansaari ne kaha, 'yun to hameshaa ek spashtikaran hota he or ek tark hota he
 Now it is a matter of deciding whether you accept the explanation and whether you accept the argument or not
 ' is intervyuu main ansaari ne bheed dwaara logon ko peet-petakar maar daalane kii ghatnaon, 'ghar vaapasi' or tarkwaadiyon kii hatyaon kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki yah 'bhartiya mulyon kaa behad kamjor ho janaa, saamaanya taur par kanoon lagu kara paane main vibhinn staron par adhikariyon kii yogyata kaa charmara janaa he or isse bhi zyada pareshaan karne vaali baat kisi naagarik kii bhartiyata par sawaal uthaaya janaa he
 Asked if he agrees that there is a kind of skepticism in the Muslim community and he feels insecure about the kind of statements being made against those people, Ansari said, Yes, this assessment is correct, which i hear from different circles of the country
 maine bengalooru main yahi baat suni
 i heard this in other parts of the country as well
 main is bare main uttar bharat main zyada sunata hum
 There is a feeling of uneasiness and feeling of insecurity at home
 ovaisi ne kiya bayaan kaa samarthansaansaisduddin ovaisika kahana he ki hamid ansaari kii spich scollar spich thi, us par koi tippanee karnaa thik nahin he
 Everything he said is absolutely correct
 unhone kaha, aae din hamaare mulk main jo vaakyaat pesh ho rahe hai, usase asuraksha kii bhaavana paidaa nahin ho rahi he kya? agar koi train main ja rahaa he bif naam par usko jaan se maar diya jaataa he
 If a Muslim's wife and children go to the toilet, they are killed
 yakeenan unhone is sachai ko pesh kiya he
 On the criticism of Shiv Sena and BJP, Owaisi says that Hamid Ansari Sahab has spoken in the past 2 years about the Muslim community before, why was he sitting silent on it, did Hamid Ansari not give advice on the triple talaq
 shivasena BJP ke log unki aalochana karke thik nahin kar rahe hai
 i am responsibly saying that they are expressing their ships
 puure intervyuu ko dekhnaa chahie
 Didn't the Prime Minister himself say that people are being killed in the name of the cow, stop it, so what would we say to the Parameter? chote parde par dharawahik ‘ramayana’ main bhagwaan ram kii bhoomika nibhaakar ghar-ghar mashhoor hue abhinayta arun govil jald hi bhaajapa main shaamil hone vaale hai

 sangam kii dhara main uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne mangalvaar ko shraddha kii dubkee lagaai to siyasat kii boonden bhi uchhaleen
 The Chief Minister left for a shower, but the party is stuck in the limelight
 bijepi ko sangam kii dhara se ram mandir ke mudde kaa kinaaraa chahie
 In search of this edge, the Center applied such a petition in Ayodhya in the Supreme Court, which blossomed the party's mustache
 centre ne supreme court se guhaar lagaai he ki paune teen acre vivaadit jameen kii jagah vahi jameen ram mandir ke liye de di jaae jisapar hindu-musalmaan kaa koi jhagada nahin he or jiskaa adhigrahan 1993 main kiya gaya tha
 In such a situation, the question arises whether BJP has become upset
 kyonki jis kumbh main yogi adityanath puri cabinet ke saath snaan or dhyaan kar rahe the usee kumbh main sadhu santon ne baghawat kaa elaan kar diya tha
 From the Sangh to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the rebel had taken over
 baat yahaan tak badi ki sangh sidhe-sidhe jajon ke gharon par dhaava bolne kii baat karne laga
 BJP understood that to win 2019, before the election announcement, there is a need for something to show and show at the temple
 modi sarkaar ne apane iraadon kii kisi ko bhanak tak nahin lagane di
 The Central Government has written in its petition that the Constitution Bench of this court has admitted that 0
 313 acre ke vivaadit kshetra ke alaava atirikt kshetra apane mul maalikon ko waapas kar diya jaae
 The Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas had demanded the excess land acquired in 1991 be returned to the original owners
 nyaas kii lagbhag 42 acre jameen adhigrihith kii he
 The Center seeks court permission to return this land
 lekin kya ye itnaa aasaan he
 Because the Supreme Court has already given its opinion about returning the land
 gaiyr- vivaadit jameen par paanch sabase jaruri tathy
 
 
 1- In 1993, the government acquired 67 acres of land near the controversial structure
 2- 1994 main supreme court ne kaha faisla aane ke baad ye jameen mul maalikon ko lautaa sakate hai
 3- In 1996, the Nyas approached the High Court but in 1997 the court rejected
 4- 2002 main vivaadit jameen par puja shuru ho gai to asalam bhure rokane ke liye supreme court pahunch gaye
 5- In 2003, the Supreme Court said that disputed and non-disputed land cannot be viewed separately
 ab 16 saal baad centre sarkaar ne arji lagaai he
 PM Modi has said that the government will not do anything on the Ram temple
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kah chuke hai sarkaar ram mandir par kuch nahin karegi
 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that the Ram temple is not on the government's agenda
 ain chunaav se pehle maahaul aisa banane laga ki ram mandir par bijepi ne dhokhaa diya he
 Dissatisfied voices began to arise within the party itself, within the government and within the Sangh and when it felt that these voices were getting higher, the government moved the petition to return the land to the court
 narsinha raav sarkaar ne adhigrahit kii thi jamiuyodhya main ramajnmabhumi ke aasapaas kareeb 70 acre jameen centre sarkaar ke paas he, jisamen se 67 acre jameen 1993 main narsinha raav sarkaar ne adhigrahit kii thi
 2 of it
 77 acre kii jameen par elahabaad hoicourt ne 2010 me faisla sunaaya tha
 Out of this, the land which is in dispute is merely 0
 313 acre he
 In 1993, the Supreme Court imposed a stay on this land and refused to do any work or construction
 sarkaar ne supreme court se kaha he ki isamen 40 acre zamin ram janmabhumi nyaas kii he
 It should be returned to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas
 is arji ke saath hi modi sarkaar ne saaf kar diya he ki agar supreme court uski baat maan leti he ki ram janmabhumi nyaas ram mandir kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he
 On September 30, 2010, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court divided the disputed land into 3 parts
 jis jameen par ram lalaa virajman hai use hindu mahasabha ko, duusare hisse ko nirmohi akhaade ko or tisare hisse ko sunni vakf board ko de diya gaya tha
 Now the government has appealed to give non-disputed land to Hindu parties
 nirmohi akhaada sarkaar kii arji se naaraajaram mandir par modi sarkaar kii pahal ko sadhu-sant apane-apane chashme se dekh rahe hai
 The Opposition is calling it another politics on the temple, while the Nirmohi Arena is angry with the government's plea
 uske vakeelon ne kaha ki sarkaar ko arzi daakhil karne se pehle unase sampark karnaa chahie tha
 At the same time, other saints are calling it a deception and a step that is not going to get any benefit
 muslim pakshakaar ikbaal ansaari ko sarkaar kii apil par koi aitraaj nahin he
 Overall, the story is that in 2014 the discourse that has been made for the public has come to a halt in the name of Ram
 bijepi ke liye mushkil ye he ki vipaksh ne jis tarah se narendra modi ke khilaaf gherebandi kii he uskaa use bhi andaja nahin tha

 But i have done good films that can be appreciated
 ''taapasi ne khulaasa kiya ki jab kangana ne unke bare main coment kiya tha to ve dukhi hui thim
 The actress said- "it was shocking for me, because it was said by someone whom i have always liked
" main niraash thi

 i am cheap because she claims that she is an expensive actress

 '' Kuch log Kangana ko copy kar ke he apni dukaan chalate hain, magar pls note, they never acknowledge her not even a mention of her name in praising the trailer, last i heard Taapsee ji said Kangana needs a double filter and Tapsee ji you need to stop being a sasti copy 🙏https: / / t

 The story of 'revolver Rani', who kidnapped the groom from Hamirpur in UP on the night of 15 May, has now taken a new turn
 police ne donon ko banda se dhund nikaala or apane saath hamirpur kii maudaha kotwali main le ai
 'revolver Rani' was seen in his entire face, while the groom was speaking
 gidgidaata hua duulhaa kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar rahaa tha
 At the same time, the voice of 'revolver Rani' was a complete threat
 'revolver rani' yani varsha sahune 15 may ko duulhe ashok yadav ko asalhon ke dam par agava karne se saaf inkaar kiya
 Varsha claimed that Ashok himself went with him on his own free will
 varsha ke mutabik ashok usee car se gaya jo 15 may ko dulhan kii vidaai ke liye sajaa kar rakhi gai thi
 According to Varsha, the truth of his claim can be asked from the driver who drove the car
 jahaan varsha kotwali main kadak aawaaj main baat kar rahi thi vahiin ashok yadav ke munh se shabd tak nahin nikal paa rahe the
 He was all the time begging
 ashok ko ek do baar ye kehete suna gaya ki usko dhamkaaya gaya, jabardasti kii gai
 On this, Varsha immediately cut his point and said that nothing like this happened but he had gone on his own free will
 bataa den ki 15 may ko ashok yadav kii shaadi kotwali kshetra ke bhavani gaanv main raamjivan yadav kii beti bharti yadav ke saath tay thi
 But as soon as Varsha Sahu came to know about Ashok Yadav getting married elsewhere, she reached Bhavani village
 aarope he ki varsha asalhe ke dam par ashok yadav ko agava kar le gai
 At the same time, Varsha says that Ashok was already sitting in the car and went with him on his own free will
 ashok yadav kii ek or hakeekat kaa khulaasa hua he ki wo pehle bhi ek shaadi kar chukaa he jisase uske do bachche hai
 After the demise of the first wife, Ashok was identified with Varsha Sahu, a resident of Chhatarpur
 varsha philhal banda main rahakar job karti he
 Varsha says that his affair with Ashok had been going on for the past eight years and now he was going to betray her and marry another girl
 varsha kaa ye bhi kahana he ki ashok ye kah kar aayaa tha ki uske dost kii shaadi he, lekin shaq hone par wo khud bhavani gaanv hakeekat jaanane ai
 When Varsha was asked a question about raising Ashoka on his own, he replied whether he found any real
 varsha ne ek or hairaan karne vaala daawa kiya ki ek din pehle hi ashok ne uske saath mandir main shaadi kii
 According to Varsha, Ashoka's uncle was also present at the temple at the time of marriage and he also blessed
 maudaha kotwali police ne jab ashok or varsha ko media ke saamne pesh kiya to pehle to yah donon kuch bhi bolne se kataraate rahe
 But later when Varsha started speaking, Ashok had no answer
 police ne mukadmaa darj kar liya he or is disha main aage kii karrwai kar rahi he
 There is talk of 'revolver Rani' frowns everywhere
 lekin saath hi ye sawaal bhi kiya ja rahaa he ki us ladki yani bharti yadav kaa kya kasoor jise 15 may ko gale main maala daal kar uske haal par chhod diya
 After all, how will he get justice

 yah pehla mauka tha jab bollywood cinema main apane hi kunbe ke ek kirdaar par film banaai gai
 Earlier Bollywood made biopic on heroes like Paan Singh Tomar to Gandhi, Bhagat Singh, Subhash but this is probably the first time of a biopic on any face of Bollywood
 ham baat kar rahe hai sunil dutt or naragis ke bete sanjay dutt par bani film sanju kii
 Sanjay Dutt is one such face of the cinema world who inherited the entry and acting in Bollywood
 maa kaa dulaara, pita ke anushaasan kaa maaraa, paise or umr ke nashe main bahakta or bhatakkar galat raaston par chalata ek kirdaar
 Whoever was accused of meeting terrorists, sometimes there was a blemish of playing a bad child by playing drugs and sex
 jiske paas se pratibandhit hathiyaar baraamad hue, jo nashe ke har tareeke ko apni nason main utaarata hua zindagi jeeta rahaa
 Family bonds, discipline and social prestige that never mattered
 jo apni sharton par aage chalata maa kaa bigadel betaa bana rahaa
 Who saw Mumbai burning in the fire and the metropolis glowing in the night colors
 or donon ne use prabhavit kiya
 Both changed the way of his life
 vivaadon or rahasyon kii yahi zindagi sabko aakarshith karti rahi
 There are very few who do not like Sanjay Dutt
 usase bhi kam ve hai jinaki sanjay dutt kii zindagi kii kahani main ruchi na ho
 This face, playing one strong character after another on the screen, has made its place in people's eyes
 yah ek aisa kirdaar he jisaki ankhen uski pahchaan hai- khalanaayak ho yaa vastav, wo laal dore vaali badi badi nashili ankhen hindi cinema ke kisi or hero ke naseeb main nahin raheen
 Rajkumar Hirani wrote and directed Sanju to cover the same sea of hirani's Sanju jiyanas at the box office
 or logon ke dil main sanjay dutt ke prati pyaar, jigyaasa or ruchi ne chaar din main hi keval bharat main 145 karod kaa kaarobaar karke is film ko safalataa ke nae kirtimanon se nawaz diya
 But alas this film is a biopic by Sanjay Dutt, it is difficult to say
 ek-do pahaluon ko chhod den to adhiktar baaten jo is film main dikhaai gayi, log unke bare main avgat hai
 This film is a cinematic PR work of improving the image of Sanju among people who know Sanju
 kitne hi sawaal is film main anuttarit rah gaye
 From Sunil Dutt's politics to Nargiska, that little spoiled son could not be found anywhere in this film
 na hi bete ko lekar maa-baap ke bich kisi tarah kaa virodhabhash is cinema main dekhne ko mila
 This film is silent on Sanjay Dutt's youth, studies, marriage, children
 350 mahilaon ke saath shaareerik sambandhon kii sweekaarokti se zyaada is film main sanjay dutt kii zindagi main mahilaon kaa mahatv dikhaai nahin detaa
 The impact of mother's illness and death is also very confused
 sanjay darasal us puure daur se kaise guzare, nirdeshak ise logon ko eemaandaaree se nahin dikhaa sakaa
 Moreover, the Bollywood, because of which Sanju is known, the director is also unable to bring his friendship and enmity, support and stumbling block
 ek nasha karaane vaale dost or ek nasha chhudaane vaale dost ke alaava baaki wo saare charitra yaa to keval kshanik hai or yaa phir nadaarad, jinke bina sanju kii zindagi kii kahani puri nahin hoti
 The film seems to be moving the whole time in the absence of a tightrope with high points being negligible
 aisa lagata he jaise sanjay dutt apane paksh main kuch ghatnaon kaa sarasare taur par zikr karte hue logon ko apni safai pesh karne main or khud ko maasoom, dayaa kaa paatr or sahanubhuti maangane vaala insaan sabit karne main lage hai
 Paresh Rawal does not look as white as Sunil Dutt, Manisha Koirala could not cover Nargis's eyes and life
 nashe main duba sanju balsulabh or naatakeey zyaada he, nashe main duba hua kam
 Ranbir Kapoor appears to be struggling to get Sanjay Dutt in the entire film
 diarector unhen bal or kapade pahanaakar sanju bananaa chahta he lekin darshak sanjay dutt kii wo ankhen aakhir tak nahin dekh pate jinaki vajah se ve apane is sitare ko lakhon kii bheed main or tamaam chamakate chehron ke bich alag pahchaan lete hai
 After the news of Bollywood becoming a biopic on this character, it was felt that maybe some deep and strong work will be seen, maybe it will be a conversation with Sanju people that they want to know
 lekin aisa kuch hua nahin
 Amidst the changing scenes on the screen, the viewers keep searching for their Sanjay Dutt and the film ends
 or is film ke khatm hone ke saath khatm ho jaati he ek sarthak or zaruri byopic darshakon ko de paane kii gunjaaish
 Rajkumar Hirani came to make money earning cinema but the audience is still searching for the Sanju for which he had bought the ticket
 bollywood ke charitron par byopic kii pehali koshish ek asafal film or ek safal piaar bhar he
 After defeating his captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to earn money from the advertisement, now Virat Kohli has won another match with him
 yah platform soshal media kaa he
 Virat Kohli is now being discussed more than Dhoni on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram
 ek angreji akhbaar ke mutabik march ke maheene menviraat kohliper 12 lakh se adhik charchaa kii gai jabaki captain dhoni par charchaa 7 lakh hi hui
 Last year, Mahendra Singh Dhoni was ranked 23rd in Forbes' list among the top athletes
 yahi nahin vigyapanon se 27 million dollar kii kamai karne vaale dhoni is list main maujuud ekmaatr cricketer the
 Till last year, a company like Pepsi showing both Virat and Dhoni is bringing only Virat in their advertisements during this summer
 imoji theme par pepsy ke vigyaapan main pichley maheene viraat kohli or ranbir kapur dikhe
 According to sources, Pepsi has not yet considered using Dhoni this summer
 haalanki world tii20 shuru hone se thik do maheene pehle janvari 2016 tak dhoni ne viraat par soshal media par is maamle main badhat bana rakhi thi
 Kohli beat Dhoni last year in the case of Twitter followers
 twit karne ke maamle main viraat captain dhoni se agevaise baat agar kisi do logon kesoshal media par prasiddhiki ho rahi he to yahaan is baat kaa khyal jarur rakhana padataa he ki in donon ne us dauraan kitne post kiye hai
 Here Virat is far ahead of his captain Dhoni
 dhoni ne apane twitor handle par pichley teen maheene ke dauraan keval 20 twit kiye, inamen aadhe to unke vigyapanon ke the, vahiin unke up captain kohli ne unase teen gune se bhi zyada 70 twit kiye
 During this time, when Kohli was not part of the team after returning from the Australian tour, he also shared his holiday pictures

 It is also expressed by the number of his followers

 Mahatma Gandhi's granddaughter Tara Gandhi Bhattacharya questioned the sensitivity of Chief Minister Narendra Modi regarding the 2002 Gujarat riots
 unhone kaha ki unhen bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke chehre par hinsa or aatank kii in 11 saal puraani ghatnaon ko lekar koi dard or karunaa najar nahin aati
 Tara told reporters here, 'I wonder how he (modi), while in politics, being a man and going through Gujarat (of riots), talks about that violent phase without showing any pain,' However, the vice-chairman of the Delhi-based Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti made it clear that 'she is not passing any judgment on Modi' as she does not know him closely
 gujarat dangon kii prishthbhumi main modi par jari siyaasi aarope-pratyaropon se khud ko ehtiyathan alag karte hue tara ne kaha, ‘main is vishay main koi raajnneetik charchaa nahin karnaa chaahati, kyonki mujhe sari siyaasi partiyaan ek-si lagati hai
 Political parties have more limits than possibilities
 ’ tara ne kaha, ‘maine ek baar modi ko gujarat main bhaashan dete vakt dur se dekha tha
 i cannot judge them
 lekin mujhe unke chehre par us vakt koi karunaa nahin dikhaayi detii, jab vah gujarat dangon ke aatank ke sandarbh kaa zikr karte hai
 'she recalls,' When i saw the sight of the refugee camps after the Gujarat carnage (riots), i was so sad that i could not sleep for the next six months
 ’ jari'gujarat dangon ke dard se sihar jaati hum'78 varshiya tara ne kaha, ‘main ek gujarati, ek mahila or is lambi aayu tak pahunchane ke kaaran (gujarat dangon ke) dard se sihar jaati hum
 In such a subject, Modi is being spoken without showing sorrow
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘main unki (modi kii) raajnneeti kii baat nahin karti
 But if (on the Gujarat riots), my grief-stricken face would have come before me, i would have liked as a human being
 ’yah kahe jane par ki modi bhi apane bhaashanon main mahatma gandhi kaa naam lete hai, baapu kii potee ne fouran pratikriya jataayi, ‘gandhi ab sabake hai or unki baat kiye bina kisi kaa guzaara nahin hoga
 In an interview, Tara objected to Modi's question of the Gujarat riots as a comparative example of a dog's puppy accidentally falling under the wheels of a car and termed the precedent as 'use of lewd speech'
 'sarkaar main koi bhi aaye, lekin usamen karunaa or saahas ho'tara ne kaha, ‘vah (modi) kute kaa naam kyon le rahe hai
 Dogs are more valuable than us (humans) in the universe
 manushya sristi kaa bahut saamaanya jeev he
 Man is not the best creature of the universe
 ’ yah puche jane par ki kya vah modi ke pradhanmantri banane kii sthiti main bharat ke loktantric mulyon ke saamne koi khatra dekh rahi hai, ‘main kisi kaa naam nahin le rahi hum, kyonki kisi ek kaa naam lekar dusron ko maaf nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Anyone in the government should come, but he should have compassion and courage
 ’unhone isi silsile main aage kaha, ‘jo bhi sarkaar main aaye, vah nirbhik ho or satta kii seemabaddhata main na bandhe
 He should have so much courage that if he cannot fulfill any promise to the public, then he can take the responsibility and leave the throne
 ’ tara ne ek sawaal par kaha ki khaadya suraksha kanoon or soochna kaa adhikaar (artiai) kanoon desh kii jarurat hai
 But it is the responsibility of the government as well as citizens to stop misuse of these important laws
 jabaki dilli ke marij khush hai
 He says that after this scheme, he is getting a chance to show his merge to the doctor in a short time in the hospital and the medicine is also getting very quickly

 bhartiya railway ko raftaar dene or modern banane ke liye rail karmchaariyon ne ek lakh se zyada idia die hai
 In these suggestions, there are many new ideas ranging from running a new type of train to cutting expenses
 darasalralveke deveopment ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi rail karmchaariyon se sidhe baatcheet karnaa chaahate hai
 For this, the railway requested its workers to send the idea
 sitambar ke antim hafte se abtak railway ke paas takreeban 1 lakh idia aa chuke hai
 Although the time fixed for giving the idea ended at eight o'clock on Monday night, the Railways say that the suggestions that come after this will also be considered later
 railway main sudhaar ke liye maange suzavarilway ne yah kavayad pichley maah railmantri suresh prabhu ke suzav par shuru kii thi
 Prabhu said that the railway has an army of over 13 lakh employees
 aise main kyon na unase hirelway main sudhaarke liye idia maange jaaen
 The reason for this was also that railway employees are directly connected to the railways
 aise main ve vyaavhaarik idia de sakate hai
 Only then did the Railways ask all its employees for an idea that if they were made railway ministers for a day, at what level would they like to improve the railways
 har suzav kaa hoga copy rhitelway board ke ek aalaa afasar ke mutabik somvaar tak ek lakh se zyada idia mil chuke hai
 Although their full count will be known only later, but broadly it has become clear that more than one lakh ideas have been received
 ab unki study kii ja rahi he
 Railways do not have sufficient staff to consider such a large number of suggestions
 lihaaja alag-alag department ke logon ko isamen lagaaya ja rahaa he
 The special thing is that every person who gives an idea will be given a copy of it
 lihaaja kisi ek idia ko koi doosraa copy nahin kar saktaa he
 These suggestions received by the railways officials of the Railway Board say that there are many interesting suggestions in huge quantity
 kuch aise bhi hai, jin par vichaar karnaa sambhav nahin hoga
 But overall there have been some good suggestions as well
 ek suzav yah aayaa he ki railway kii sabhi linon kaa elactriffication kar diya jaae
 Which will make the same operating system in the railway
 pradooshan or dijal kaa kharch bhi kam hoga
 Instead, the cost of electricity will increase slightly but it will not cause pollution
 isi tarah se ek idia yah bhi aayaa ki railway main karpshan ko band kar dena chahie
 But there are some such ideas, which are not practical
 kyonki yah nahin bataaya gaya ki karpshan kahaan he or use kaise roka jaae
 a strong idea has been to make Aadhaar card mandatory in ticket booking
 isse tikaton kii dallali par puri tarah se lagaam lag jaaegi
 Proposalway officials will appear before the PM, all the ideas will be read soon
 railway kaa kahana he ki in idia ke baad theme tay kii jaaegi or general manager level par tiimon kaa gathan hoga
 After that the theme will be given to each team
 yah team study karke apana puraa idia detail main degi
 After this, the teams will be shortlisted and finally some teams will be finalized
 final main chuni gai karmchaariyon or afasaron kii timen 18 se 20 november ke bich teen din khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saamne apana pregentation dengi
 After this, work will be started on the basis of the proposal that the PM will like

 a vote was held in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly after discussing the motion of confidence in which 99 votes were cast in support of the government and 105 votes in protest
 kumaraswami sarkaar apana vishwaas mat sabit karne main asafal rahi
 After this HD Kumaraswamy went to Raj Bhavan and submitted his resignation
 unke istife ke baad karnataka ke governor vajubhai vaala bijepi netaa bies yediurppa ko sarkaar ke gathan ke liye aamantrit kar sakate hai
 In the midst of the political turmoil that has been going on in Karnataka for the last one month, the BJP was demonstrating from its stand that it does not want to topple the jds-congress government, it is going to fall on its own
 shaayad bijepi ko lag rahaa tha ki sarkaar ke girane par raashtrapati shashan lagaakar isi saal ke ant main chunaav karaane par vah satta hasil kar sakati he
 He hoped to win it like the Lok Sabha elections
 use yah bhi lag rahi tha ki purna bahumat se aane par uski karnataka main paanch saal tak sthir sarkaar bani rahegi
 Karnataka, on the other hand, spread on the ambitions of BJP leader Yeddyurappa
 ve isi vidhansabha main mukhyamantri bananaa chaahate hai
 They know that if not now, then never
 iske peeche ahm kaaran he yediurppa kii umr
 He is 76 years old and he knows that BJP will not give him a ticket in the next assembly elections
 bijepi ne niyam bana liya he ki 75 saal ke adhik aayu ke netaa ko kisi bhi chunaav kaa tikat nahin diya jayega
 The meaning is clear, if Yeddyurappa is not able to become the Chief Minister now, then even the CM will not be able to become a distant MLA in future
 unke liye yahi antim mauka he jise ve khona nahin chaahate hai
 However, the path is not yet clear for Yeddyurappa
 yadi bijepi netritv sthir sarkaar ke liye intjaar ke apane rukh par kaayam rahata he or party sarkaar gathit karne ke bajaay chunaav ke jariye satta par kabiz hona chaahati he to phir governor raashtrapati shashan lagane kii sifarish kar sakate hai
 In this situation, Yeddyurappa's hopes will remain clouded
 haalanki sambhaavna yahi he ki party karnataka ke apane is diggaj netaa ko naaraaz karnaa nahin chaahegi or unhen siem banane ke liye hari jhandi de degi
 Karnataka has 224 assembly seats and one nominated member
 may 2018 main pehle 222 vidhansabha siton ke liye chunaav hue or baaki do siton ke liye baad main chunaav hue
 The results of this Karnataka election were shocking
 chunaav main bijepi ko kul 105 siten hasil huin jabaki ek nirdaleey ke shaamil hone ke baad congress 80 vidhayakon ke saath duusari sabase badi party ban gai
 JDS won 37 seats in the election
 sarkaar ko ek nirdaleey or ek bispi vidhayak kaa bhi samarthan mila
 Thus, the congress-jds coalition government was running with the support of 79 mlas of Congress, 37 of JDS, Independents one and BSP one, thus 118 mlas
 vishwaas prastaav par charchaa ke dauraan echdi kumaraswami ne kaha ki 'main voting ke liye taiyaar hum
 He said that i am willing to leave this post happily
 unhone kaha ki raajnneeti main main achaanak or apratyaashit taur par aayaa tha
 When the assembly election results came (in 2018), i was thinking of leaving politics
 ' vastav main kumaraswami swasthya ke kaarnon se raajnneeti se dur hona chaahate the lekin unke pita echdi devegoda ne unhen prerit kiya or ve taiyaar ho gaye the
 After defeating the government in the trust vote, BJP leader and former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa called it a victory for democracy
 karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri bies yediurppa ne kaha ki yah loktantr kii jeet he
 People were fed up with the Kumaraswamy government
 main karnataka ke logon ko aashwast karnaa chahta hum ki vikaas kaa ek nayaa yug ab shuru hoga
 He said that we assure the farmers that in the coming days we will give more importance to them
 ham jald se jald uchit nirnay lenge
 Two marriages may not be considered in most countries, but there are many countries in the world where such marriages are encouraged
 sanyukt arab emirate (UAE) bhi ek aisa hi desh he
 The government there has announced an additional house allowance to people with two wives
 khalij times ke anusaar desh main avivaahit ladakiyon kii badhati sankhya ko dekhte hue sarkaar logon ko duusari shaadi karne ko protsaahit karne ke liye yah skim lekar ai he
 uae's Minister for Infrastructure Development abdulla belhaf al nuimi ne buudhvaar ko fedral neshnal kaunsingl (FNC) ke satr ke dauraan yah ghoshnaa kii
 He said that the Ministry has decided that all the people having two wives will be given house allowance under the Sheikh Zayed Housing Program
 asal main yah duusari bivi ke liye makaan bhatta hoga
 That is, it will be in addition to the house allowance already received by the family with one wife
 mantri ne kaha, 'duusari bivi ke liye bhi usee tarah ke rahan-sahan kii vyavastha honi chahie, jaisaa ki pehali bivi ke liye hota he
 He said that giving house allowance would encourage people to marry again and reduce the number of unmarried women in the UAE
 mantralay yah chahta he ki duusari bivi ko bhi pehle bivi kii tarah hi makaan mili
 Significantly, FNC members have been expressing concern over the increasing number of unmarried girls in the UAE
 kuch sadasyon ne to yahaan tak kaha tha ki logon ke duusari shaadi na karne se desh par aarthik boj bad rahaa he
 Apart from this, its social implications have also been discussed
 aapane kabhi match ke tikat ke daam kisi khilaadi ke khilne yaa na khilne se tay hote suna he, nahin na

 Mukesh Ambani, the country's richest businessman, has made a big entry in the telecom sector with his Reliance Jio 4G plan
 jeeyo ne apane data plan ke jariye 2021 tak 4G ke 50 fisadi market share (revenue) par kabja karne kaa torget rakhaa he
 To achieve this target, Jio is eyeing two weak market players Vodafone and Idea, which have announced the merger and hold about 44% market share before the merger
 vodaphone-idia ke graahakon par najartelecom sector main disambar 2016 kii timahi main vodaphone india lagbhag 24 fisadi or idia 19 fisadi revenue par kabiz he
 The combined market share of both is currently around 44 per cent
 vahiin abhi tak sector kii diggaj bharti airtel lagbhag 33 fisadi revenue ke saath top par baithi he
 Live on 50% 4G market? Mukesh Ambani believes that the telecom sector will see a data boom in the next 3-4 years and Jio will occupy the largest share of the market due to its cheap 4G tariff
 is torget ko paane ke liye jeeyo kaa maananaa he ki vodaphone or idia marjar agle ek saal main puraa hoga or is dauraan jeeyo unke aadhe revenue par kabja kar legi
 With this, Jio will also have to compete with Airtel to sit at the top of the market
 jeeyo ko gugaliglobal anolist goldman sex kaa maananaa he ki jeeyo itane baderevenue sherepar kabiz nahin ho sakati
 According to the agency, Vodafone and Idea will continue to be a strong player in the 4G market with a better merger during the next one year and they will not see a huge loss in their current 44% combined market share
 agency kaa yah daawa is baat par aadhaarit he ki marjar se pehle 4G market main majboot hone ke liye donon companiyon ne infrastracchar par bada nivesh kiya he
 4G in Mukesh Ambani's hand vahiin jeeyo ke is aakraamak torget par global agency morgan stanley kaa daawa he ki duniyabar main 4G market main entry karne vaali kisi bhi company ne pehle 3 saal ke dauraan 10 fisadi se zyada market par kabja nahin kiya he
 According to Morgan Stanley, a third of subscribers associated with Jio's free plan will leave her in April 2017 when she starts charging them for data

 As a result, he gave the batsman out

 Elections in Bihar are not far away now, and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's team has already started gearing up for campaigning
 janata dal united ke siem kii prachaar team ne unki jeevani ko lekar ek cartoon strip taiyaar karwaai he, jise ve soshal media par prachaarit karne ja rahe hai
 NDTV India has the cartoon strip that we brought for you
 aaj se ham nitish ji ke jivan par ek nai shrinkhalaa # munnasenitisharambh kar rahe hai
 Through this, we will share with you the journey from his Munna (childhood name) to become Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and get you exposed to some untouched aspects related to his personal life
 nitish ji ke bachapan ke saathi bataate hai ki jab bhi bachapan me khelte hue munna evam uske doston kii aapas main bahes ho jaati thi, to munna ek ped ke neeche baithkar saare masale sulajhata tha
 This was the first sign of leadership flourishing inside him
 metric kii ganit pariksha kii baat he, jab munna apana paper likh hi rahaa tha ki pariksha samaapti kii ghanti baj gai evam adhyaaapak mahoday ne uske haathon se paper chin liya
 Due to this Munna could not get 100 marks in Mathematics examination
 unke saathi bataate hai ki is baat ko unhone itani gambhirtha se liya ki mukhyamantri banate hi nitish ji ne ek niyam lagu karavaaya, jiske tahat har chaatr ko pariksha ke ant main 15 minute adhik vishleshan hetu die jaaenge
 Another thing relates to Nitish's childhood when Munna and his friend Saroj wanted to cross the railway track at a station, but unfortunately there was no bridge above that track
 trek par train sthir avasthaa main khadi hui thi, is baat kaa phayda uthaate hue donon dost train ke neeche se trek paar karne lage ki tabhi achaanak se train ne chalane kaa sanket de diya
 Munna and his friends escaped while somehow defending themselves
 us ghatana kaa hi asar tha ki mukhyamantri banate hi nitish ji ne aise kai railway trek ke upar pul banavaa die
 Shri Narendra Kumar, a friend of Nitish Kumar's college time, states that like the film 3 Idiots, there was a group of Nitish Kumar, Narendra Kumar and Arun Sinha in the college
 ye group apni atoot mitrataa ke liye janaa jaataa tha evam college kii sari gatividhiyon main bad chadhakar hissaa letaa tha
 The interesting thing is that despite being an engineer, these three friends are working beyond engineering today
 nitish kumaar kii ek sabase khaas baat rahi he unka behad saadagi ke saath jivan jeene kaa falsafa
 During his youth, he used to live in a small room in Patna with a friend and used to devote all his strength to social service
 nitish kumaar ne apni shaadi ke vaqt dahez ke 22,000 rupayon ko lene se saafe inkaar kar diya tha evam bagaiyr kisi taam-jhaam ke court marij karne kaa faisla liya
 It was talked about when Nitish Kumar became the Chief Minister for the first time
 'maa ke aashirwad main badi shakti hoti he, main vahi lene aayaa hum' kehete hue nitish ji ne apni maa parameshwari devi ke charnon main apana sar rakh diya or maa ne "dderghaayu bhav:" kehete hue sara pyaar apane laadle bete par lutaa diya
 From today we are starting a new series # Munnasneetish on the life of Nitish ji
 iske zarie ham unke munna (bachapan kaa naam) se lekar mukhyamantri nitish kumaar banane tak kaa safar aapke saath baatenge evam unke vyaktigat jivan se jude hue kuch anchhue pahaluon se aapako rubaru karavaaenge
 Nitishji's childhood companions tell that whenever Munna and his friends got into an argument while playing in childhood, Munna used to sit under a tree and solve all the issues
 ye unke andar punap rahe netritv kii pehali nishaani thi
 It is a matter of the Matriculation of Mathematics Examination, when Munna was writing his paper that the end bell rang and the teacher snatched the paper from his hands
 is kaaran munna ganit pariksha main 100 ank praapt na kar sakaa
 His colleagues say that he took this matter so seriously that after becoming Chief Minister, Nitish implemented a rule under which every student would be given 15 minutes more analysis at the end of the exam
 ek or baat nitish ke bachapan se judi he, jab munna or unke dost saroj ek stesan par bane railway trek ko paar karnaa chaahate the, lekin durbhagyavash us trek ke upar koi bhi pul nahin tha
 Taking advantage of the fact that the train was standing in a stable position on the track, the two friends started crossing the track from under the train, when the train suddenly indicated to run
 kisi tarah khud ko bachaate hue munna or unke dost vahaan se batch nikle
 The effect of that incident was that as soon as the Chief Minister became Chief Minister, Nitish had built bridges over many such railway tracks
 nitish kumaar ji ke college ke samay ke mitra shri narendra kumaar bataate hai ki film 3 idiyats kii tarah college main nitish kumaar, narendra kumaar or arun sinha kaa ek group tha
 This group was known for their unwavering friendship and took part in all the activities of the college
 rochak baat ye he ki ejeeniyar hone ke baavjood ye teenon mitra aaj ejineering se pare kaary kar rahe hai
 One of the most special things of Nitish Kumar has been his philosophy of living life with utmost simplicity
 apni javaani ke dinon main ve patna main ek chote se kamare main apane ek mitra ke saath rahete the evam apni sari takat samaaj seva main laga dete the| Nitish Kumar had refused to take 22,000 rupees of dowry at the time of his marriage and decided to marry the court without any ruckus
 baat tab kii he jab nitish kumaar pehali baar mukhyamantri bane the
 Saying 'mother's blessings have great power, i have come to take the same', Nitishji placed his head at the feet of his mother Parmeshwari Devi and the mother lavished all the love on her dear son, saying "long live you"

 i really tried liking morning shows in Pakistan, honestly i did try
 My mom has them on all the time
 i came across the show Jago Pakistan Jago with the host Sanum Jung
 When some of you shared this with me, i honest to god couldn't believe it
 Like in my head i was like, there's got to be something I'm missing here, they're not THIS blatantly ignorant or stupid for that matter
 They took fair skinned girls and literally painted their faces darker with a foundation to prove good makeup could also be done on darker skinned brides
 My question is Sanam @jung_sanam , was it really that hard to find darker skinned models to do makeup on? This is a caricature like scenario, you've painted on a a much darker face onto fair skinned girls, look at their hands and their arms
 It's like you're purposefully and intentionally making them look comical
 How is this not something close to # blackface
 I'm going to ask you the same question i asked a brand last week, how did you let this happen? How is this appropriate? How did you let this go live even? If you really had good intentions about darker skin tones and how makeup should be done, you and i both know well this was not the way to do it
 Rather you have contributed to an already disgusting sentiment in our society about darker skin tones in a fair skin obsessed pakistan
 i don't even want to get started on how cringy the actual SHOW SEGMENT was
 So let me repeat the title, Jago Pakistan Jago
