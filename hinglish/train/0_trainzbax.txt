 lalu ne sibiai par bhi srijan ghotaalaa kii jaanch dhimi karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He announced on 8 November to be present in a protest march over a year of demonetisation
 unhone kaha ki jiesti kisi bhi vyapaaree kii samaj se baahar he
 The art money of the BJP people was whitewashed through demonetisation
 isliye rajya ke har jile main kala diwas bhi usee din manaaya jayega
 In Bihar politics, there is a competition to extract each other's 'dirty picture' and 'dirty question'
 is par lalu ne tejasvi yadav kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhi hajaaron ladakiyon ke saath photo hai
 But where does someone take a selfie with BJP President Amit Shah? It is clear that Tejashwi is the son of a highlight leader, people take pride in being photographed with him
 ishrat jahaan or soharabuddin shaikh farji encounter maamalon main aaropee vivaadaaspad purv ipies adhikari diji vanjaaraa kareeb saadhe saat saal baad jail se reeha hue hai
 Vanzara, who came out of Sabarmati Central Jail on Wednesday, cannot live in Gujarat under the conditions on which he has been granted bail
 lihaaja, wo jail se sidhaa mumbai aa gaye
 Apart from the khaki uniform of the police, Vanzara's body now looks like a white kurta like a leader
 iske upar vah modi jacket bhi pahante hai, lekin raajnneetik sawaalon par kuch bhi bolne se bachate hai
 Aajtak's special conversation with DG Vanzara after his release from jail: Question: Have come out of jail after seven and a half years
 aapaki pehali pratikriya kya he?diji vanjaaraa:bhagwaan ke ghar main der he, andher nahin
 In the same manner, the judiciary is late, but not blind
 nyaay miltaa he
 One just needs to be patient
 sawaal:kya is rihaai kaa shrey amit shah, narendra modi or bijepi sarkaar ko jaataa he?diji vanjaaraa:ye ek kanoonee prakriya he
 There is no need to bring any personal thing or human being in the middle
 sawaal:jab tak congress centre main thi, aap baahar nahin nikle the or bijepi ke centre main aate hi aapako jamaanat mil gai?diji vanjaaraa:iskaa shrey nyaaypalika ko jaataa he
 This can be a mere coincidence
 nyaaypalika ko koi kharid nahin saktaa
 The judiciary provides neutral justice
 sawaal:aapke upar farji encounter ke aarope lage hai
 What do you have to say, were the encounters really fake or have you been framed? DG Vanzara: In that time, the highest number of encounters were in UP and the least in Gujarat
 lekin phir bhi sirf gujarat police ke khilaaf karrwai kii gai
 Extra political regions were behind this
 sawaal:kya congress thi unke peeche?diji vanjaaraa:hindustan kii raajnneeti iske peeche thi
 Question: Politics or any political party? DG Vanzara: Understand that politics, don't you? har cheez ko thode hi bataaya jaataa he
 There are some things that you know better than us
 sawaal:raajnneeti kii baat aap kar rahe hai
 The image of the leader is coming out after seeing your costumes
 kya aap kisi raajnneetik party yaa bijepi main shaamil honge?diji vanjaaraa:main ek pulisavaala hum or mujhe is par garv he
 Once a policeman is always a policeman
 maine jo kaam kiya, vah meraa ferj tha
 i am in politics, not politics
 desh ke liye kaam kar rahaa tha, kar rahaa hum or aage bhi karuunga
 Question: After leaving jail, did you talk to Amit Shah? Congratulations? DG Vanzara: i haven't talked to anyone yet

 is maamle main nai dilli se ek shaks ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 The name of the person arrested from the country's capital Delhi is Prabhu Dhandapani
 police ne kaha he ki is ghatnakram main shaamil donon adhikariyon ne bataaya he ki naav newjiland jane ke liye nikali thi
 It is being told that 100 to 200 people were in the boat
 jinamein mahila or bachche bhi shaamil the
 Police officer VG Ravindran has said that more than 70 bags of people aboard the boat have been recovered
 inamen se 20 se zyada pahchaan patr bhi police ko mili hai
 According to the information given by the police, clothes and dry fruits like goods have been found in these bags
 yani ye log lambii yatra kii taiyaari ke makasad se nikle the
 Police officer MJ Sojan has said that the recovered goods suggest that people packed their bags for the purpose of a long voyage
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki laapata log bich samudr main hi kahin fanse hue hai
 Police say that many Indian agencies are in search of these people
 inamen indian coast guard kii timen bhi shaamil hai
 Refugees have to travel 7000 miles to travel to New Zealand
 is yatra ko duniya kii sabase mushkil samudri yatraaon main se ek mana jaataa he
 During this time there is always a fear of cyclones, storms and rain getting stuck in the sea and bad weather
 sabase mushkil chunauti indonesia se australia ke bich ke raste main aati he
 The New Zealand immigration officer tried to get information about this, he could not be contacted
 philhal bhartiya police is maamle main laapata logon ke gharavaalon se or jaankaree jutaney kii koshish kar rahi he
 At the same time, a campaign has been launched in search of these people in the sea too
 kya bharat ko vaaki kulbhushan jadhav maamle main kansular acces mil jayega
 This is the biggest question, because the truth within Pakistan is that if Pakistan gives diplomatic help to Kulbhushan Jadhav, then the pole band inside Pakistan will be exposed to the world, and how the true terror within Pakistan, from army and ISI For this, remember a few incidents
 9 / 11 (world trade centre)- 2001danniel parl- 200226 / 11 (mumbai hamalaa)- 2008sarbajit- 2013masood ajahar- pathankot hamalamerica twin tower yani 2001 main 9 / 11 kaa hamalaa, or pakistan ne kisi america agency ko apane desh main ghusane nahin diya, jabaki aakhir main laden pakistan ke abtabad main mila
 Similarly, American journalist Daniel Pearl was killed in 2002 by terrorists
 lekin danniel ke apharan ke baad se lagaataar pakistan ne kabhi america agency ko apane yahaan aane nahin diya
 Then remember the Mumbai attack
 26 / 11 ke hamale ke baad to bharat ne paanch dogier pakistan ko saunpen
 Pakistan gave a complete list of evidence
 lekin lashkar-e-toeba ko pakistan ne aatanki sanghathan nahin mana
 Hafiz Saeed is not considered a terrorist
 bharat kii kisi agency ko jaanch ke liye pakistan kii jameen par ghusane nahin diya, phir sarbajit ko lekar ekatarfa jaanch kii
 Even after Pakistan's human rights organization questioned the suspicious role of the Pakistani army regarding Sarabjit, no Indian agency was allowed to interrogate in Pakistan and attacked Sarabjit by killing prisoners in prison
 yahi nahin, do baras pehle pathankot hamale main to pakistan kii jaanch team baqayda ye kahkar bharat ai ki vah bhi bhartiya team ko pakistan aane kii ijaajat degi
 But two years passed and 'aaj Tak' Pakistan did not allow the Indian team to investigate the Pathankot attack
 yani aglaa sawaal koi bhi puch saktaa he ki kya vaaki pakistan jadhav ke liebhartiya adhikariyonko milane kii ijaajat degaa
 This is certainly possible, because the truth within Pakistan is that power is divided into three centers, in which the army and ISI have the weakest elected government and all three of them have terrorist or fundamentalist organizations for their own purpose
 There is a need and if any foreign official within Pakistan trapped in this check and balance of power will go for investigation or if a diplomat goes to meet Jadhav, then Which truth of Kistan will be revealed to the world

 The second is booth-wise membership
 isamen booth ke hisaab se sadsy banaae jaaenge or teesraa he party ke liye sabase kamjor boothon kii sadsyta

 The party has identified weak booths
 in kamjor boothon par utane nae sadsy banaae ja rahe, jitne voton se party pichley chunaavon main haari he
 The motive is that BJP should be the strongest in every booth
 upi main abhi tak ek karod 20 lakh sadsy hai
 The BJP will add at least 20 percent more members to it

 India have taken a 3–0 lead by winning the third Test match of the series played in Mohali, compared to the previous best of 2–0
 team india ne match ke paanchaven din chauthi pari main chaar wicket ganvaakar 133 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha kar liya, or 136 ran banaakar kangaaroon ko chah wicket se parrast kar diya
 Delhi batsman Shikhar Dhawan, who scored a century in the first match of his career, was adjudged 'man of the Match'
 chotil hone kii vajah se shikhar dhawan ke sthaan par cheteshwar pujaara se murali vijay ke saath pari kii shuruyaat karwaai gai thi, lekin is pari main koi bhi bhartiya ballebaaj shandaar khel nahin diya paaya, or niyamit antaraal par murali vijay (26), pujaara (28), viraat kohli (34) tathaa sachin tendulkar (21) out hote gaye
 The last runs were chased by captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (18) and Ravindra Jadeja (8), and gave the team a historic win
 isse pehle, tisare test ke paanchaven or antim din somvaar ko australia kii puri team 223 ran par out ho gai thi
 After Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who took three wickets in the second innings of the Kangaroos on Sunday, Ravindra Jadeja also picked up three more Pragyan Ojha and Ravichandran Ashwin on Monday, and dismissed the Australian team for a total of 223 runs, but For this, the last pair of kangaroos worked hard for them
 jis samay pehali pari main sirf ek ran se shatak banane se chuke mishael stark kaa saath dene ke liye australia ke aakhri ballebaaj ke rup main xavier doharty maidan main aae, bharat ko puri ummid ho gai thi ki ab unhen behad jald ballebaaji kar 3-0 se kangaaroon ko haraane kaa record rachane kaa mauka mil jayega, lekin ek-ek kar sabhi gendbaajon ko in donon ballebaajon ne dhata bataa di
 No spin bowler, including a part-time bowler like Sachin Tendulkar, could break his pair, and after the Kangaroos innings had completed 81 overs, captain Dhoni took Bhuvneshwar and Ishant Sharma with a new ball
 jab usase bhi koi laabh na hua, to dhoni ne teen hi over ke baad ishanth kii jagah ball phir aswin ko de di, lekin vyarth
 Then when Jadeja started bowling again after the drinks, India got the wicket they had been waiting for a long time
 jadeja ne stark ko 35 ke nijee yoga par aswin ke haathon lapakwaakar kangaaroon ko aakhri jhatka diya
 Earlier, on Sunday, playing ahead of 75 for three wickets, Nathan Lyon and Philip Hughes tried to push the innings forward and play, but Ojha scored Lyon for a total of 89 to wicketkeeper captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 Grabbed hands
 lyon apane ravivaar ko nijee score main 14 ran hi jodakar kul 18 ran bana sake
 Captain Clarke came into the field after that, but he was caught by Jadeja at the personal sum of 18 by Cheteshwar Pujara and returned to the pavilion
 australia kaa chatha wicket huges ke rup main gira tha, jinhone out hone se pehle 69 ranon kaa mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 Hughes was dismissed lbw for Ashwin
 tippaniyan The Kangaroos' seventh wicket was again awarded to Jadeja, who caught Moses Henriques off his own ball on a personal total of just two runs
 aathvaan wicket peter sidle kaa gira tha, jinhen ojha ne 13 ke nijee yoga par pleen bold kiya
 Ashwin again came out for the ninth wicket, and was trapped lbw to Brad Hedin on a personal total of 30 runs
 isse pehle, kangaaroon ke pehali pari main banaae gaye 408 ranon ke jawaab main bharat ne apni pehali pari main kariyar kaa aagaaz karne vaale salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan (187) or duusare salaami ballebaaj murali vijay (153) kii behtareen pariyon kii madad se 499 banaae the
 In that innings, apart from Shikhar and Murali, only Virat Kohli (67) was hit with an unbeaten half-century
 ullekhneey he ki mohali ke punjab cricket association (pisie) maidan main khele ja rahe shrunkhlaa ke is tisare test match kaa pehla din (14 march, guuruuvaar) puri tarah barsaat main dhul gaya tha, or shuukravaar ko mehmaan team ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne kaa faisla kiya tha

 In that innings, apart from Shikhar and Murali, only Virat Kohli (67) was hit with an unbeaten half-century
 ullekhneey he ki mohali ke punjab cricket association (pisie) maidan main khele ja rahe shrunkhlaa ke is tisare test match kaa pehla din (14 march, guuruuvaar) puri tarah barsaat main dhul gaya tha, or shuukravaar ko mehmaan team ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Cheteshwar Pujara was replaced by Murali Vijay in place of Shikhar Dhawan due to an injury, but no Indian batsman was able to give a great game in this innings, and at regular intervals Murali Vijay (26), Pujara ( 28), Virat Kohli (34) and Sachin Tendulkar (21) were out
 aakhri ranon kaa peechha captain mahendra singh dhoni (18) or rabindra jadeja (8) ne kiya, or team ko aitihaasik jeet dilava di
 Earlier, on Monday, Australia's entire team was dismissed for 223 on the fifth and final day of the third Test
 ravivaar ko kangaaroon kii duusari pari main teen wicket lene vaale bhubaneshwar kumaar ke baad somvaar ko rabindra jadeja ne bhi teen or pragyan ojha va ravichandran aswin ne do-do wicket chatkaaye, or australian team ko 223 ranon ke kul yoga par out kar daalaa, lekin iske liye unase kangaaroon kii aakhri jodi ne kaaphi mehnat karwaai
 At the time Xavier Doherty came on the field as Australia's last batsman to support Mitchell Starc, who missed a century in the first innings by scoring just one run, India had full expectation that they could now bat 3-0 very quickly
 This will give a chance to create a record of defeating the Kangaroos, but one by one, all these bowlers were defied by the two batsmen
 sachin tendulkar jaise part-time bowler samet koi bhi spin gendbaaj unki jodi ko nahin tod paaya, or kangaaroon kii pari ke 81 over puure hone ke baad captain dhoni ne nai gend lekar bhubaneshwar or ishanth sharma ko thama di
 When there was no profit from that either, Dhoni again gave the ball to Ashwin in place of Ishant after three overs, but in vain
 phir jab jadeja ne drinks ke baad dobaaraa gendbaaji shuru kii to bharat ko vah wicket mila, jiskaa unhen kaaphi der se intazaar tha
 Jadeja gives Stark a final blow to the Kangaroos by grabbing Ashwin at a personal total of 35
 isse pehle, ravivaar ko teen wicket ke nuksaan par 75 ran se aage khelte hue nathan lyon or philip huges ne pari ko aage badhaane or tikkar khilne kii koshish kii thi, lekin ojha ne 89 ke kul yoga par lyon ko wicketiper captain mahendra singh dhoni ke haathon lapakvaa diya

 Former media adviser to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and senior journalist Sanjay Baru said that he was advised to release his book before the general elections, as it would no longer have any significance

 Baru said, i understand Narasimha Rao should have a memorial in Delhi

 He said that Sonia Gandhi did not become Prime Minister in 2004, as Congress allies never accept her
 isliye unhone manmohan singh ko chunaa

 insaan kii tarah kutton ke swabhaav main bhi hota he badlavindian institute of science ajukeshan and research main khulasadeshbhar main log aawaara kutton ke badhate aatank se pareshaan hai
 In the coming days, there are many such cases in which dogs attack people
 kai maamalon main to insaanon kii maut tak ho chuki he
 The administration is also failing to contain the increasing number of dogs
 Aajtak
 in When many facts have come to know about the nature of dogs, many interesting things have come out
 indian institute of science ajukeshan and research (kolkata) ke saath kaam kar rahi anindita bhadraa ne bataaya ki kutton ke swabhaav badalane ke kai kaaran hai
 He says that dogs' nature changes according to location, time and situation
 anindita bhadraa ne bataaya ki hamane aawaara or paaltu kutton ke swabhaav ko lekar research kii he
 Many aspects have emerged in this
 pehla to yah ki aawaara kutton kii tulana main paaltu kutton kii parvarish alag tarah se hoti he, jiskaa asar unke swabhaav par bhi dikhaai detaa he
 In her report in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution Journal, Anindita Bhadra has said that stray dogs encounter many humans and animals every day
 aamtaur par kute apane ilaakon main rahete hai or unke aasapaas rahane vaale insaanon se pahchaan bana lete hai
 He told that we did research on 120 dogs from different places in West Bengal
 isamen hamane dekha ki jin kutton ko hamane khaanaa diya or dosti bharaa vyavhaar kiya to unke swabhaav main bhi badlaav aayaa
 The dogs started moving tails and stared
 jab ham unke paas kuch dinon baad gaye to wo hamen pahchaanane lage
 At the same time, when the researchers gave food to some dogs in suspicious tone, some dogs did not eat and started staring
 jabaki kuch kutton ne teji se khaanaa khaaya or insaanon ke prati koi dosti nahin dikhaai
 a few days later, when the researchers visited the place again, the dogs neither wagged nor showed any friendship
 ilaakon ke hisaab se kutton ke swabhaav main hote hai badlaav
 
 
 Researchers also claim that the nature of dogs varies by region
 indian institute of science ajukeshan and research (kolkata) kii anindita bhadraa bataaya ki hamane dekha he ki shahari ilaakon main kute un jagahon par hinsak ho jate hai jahaan par unhen khaanaa kam miltaa he or kutton kii sankhya adhik ho jaati he
 Hungry dogs often become violent due to lack of food
 shahari ilaakon main aamtaur par kachare yaa pashu premiyon se unhen khaanaa mil jaataa he
 Also, due to living among humans, they are not much attackers
 jabaki shaharon ke bahari hisson or gramin ilaakon main yah sthiti thik ulat he
 Dogs do not get food in rural areas and they also stay away from humans, which is why when a human comes around them, they become attackers
 meting (prajnan) ke vakt bhi hinsak hote hai kute
 
 
 Researchers say that dogs become violent even when they are breeding
 yah dekha gaya he ki prajnan ke dauraan or bachche hone ke baad unki raksha ke liye kute aamtaur par hamalavar ho jate hai
 The population of dogs exceeded that of many countries
 
 
 kutton ke jivan chakra par research kar rahe kuch vaigyanikon kii maane to desh main kutton kii taadaad 6 karod se zyada ho gai he
 This growth has taken place in the last 10 to 15 years
 yah aankada duniya ke kai deshon or bharat ke kai rajyon kii aabaadi se kahin zyada he
 However, the government does not have strong figures for this
 welcome trust / debiti india elliance ke saath kutton ke swabhaav or rebies par research kar rahe profesar abi tameem vanak ne bataaya ki bharat main kutton kii taadaad karodon main he
 Government departments have rules to control them, but they are not able to prove effective
 yahi vajah he ki bharat main kutton kii taadaad badhati hi ja rahi he or yahi vajah he ki unke swabhaav main bhi badlaav dekha gaya he
 Due to the increase in the number of dogs, they have a problem of eating
 isi kaaran unhen hinsak hote dekha gaya he

 During the interrogation of the sharp shooter Karthik Haldar, who was caught in the Gujarat Crime Branch recently, he said that he had conspired to kill SP Chanchal Mishra, who was investigating the Asaram case
 iske saath hi is cese ke gavaahon ko maarane ke liye AK-47 kharidne kii yojana banaai thi
 People are shocked by this revelation of Karthik

 He said that his target was the witness and the investigating officer of this case
 espi ne jodhpur main rape cese kii jaanch kii thi
 Haldar was annoyed as she spoke strictly to Asaram
 haldar ne police ko bataaya ki usne chanchal mishra ko bam se udaane kaa plan banaaya gaya tha
 For this he also did his Reiki
 ek purana scooter kharida tha
 He was preparing to buy AK47 for killing the witnesses, for which Asaram's servants from all over the country collected 25 lakh rupees
 police ke mutabik, haldar ne bataaya ki hathiyaar kharidne ke liye fund gomutra kii supplai karke ikaitha kiya gaya tha

 According to Rail News, the railways has been ordered by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), the country's largest consumer court, on the petition of a passenger to 1
 01 lakh rupee kaa harjaana de
 The passenger could not catch the train as the route changed
 kamishan ne is baat par aashcharya vyakt kiya ki us yatri kaa phone number or pataa hone ke baavjood railway ne use suchit karne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 Justice Malik, the chairman of the bench, said that Babu, who gave the ticket, should have all the information about the operation of the desired train
 iske baad hi use tikat jari karnaa chahie tha
 The complainant must have filled the reservation form, which contains the details of the passenger
 railway ko use kam se kam esemes yaa kisi or tarah se soochna to deni hi chahie thi
 On the other hand, the railway said that the Utkal Kalinga train route had to be changed due to the attack by Naxalites and it was being run by another route
 usne yah bhi bataaya ki root main badlaav kii soochna vibhinn akhabaaron ke madhyam se de di gai thi
 The commission turned down the plea and said that it was not necessary to read the newspaper
 usne yah bhi kaha ki hamaari raay he ki duusare paksh (railway) ne tikat dene main saavdhaanee se kaam nahin kiya he
 Apart from this, he did not even try to contact her by SMS or letter

 Book: The Illicit Happiness of Other People (english) Author: Manu Joseph Publisher: Harper collinsedition: Hard Bound (total Pages: 352) Price: 499 This second book by Manu Joseph, who won several awards for his very first novel 'serious Men' 'the Illicit Happiness of Other People' is a psychological thriller full of dark comedy and tragedy
 kamedi, trgidi, rahasy or romaanch kaa dadli combination hi is noval kii khaasiyat he
 There is a lot of suspense in this novel that will keep you hooked and that is why it has become one of my favorite books
 1980 ke madras kii prishthbhumi main likhe gaye is noval ke centre main he unni chaako, jo kahani ke shuru hone se pehle hi mar chukaa he
 The 17-year-old expresses his understanding of the world and his quest for truth by making cartoons
 lekin ek din unni apni building se kudakar aatmahatya kar letaa he
 He neither leaves a suicide note behind him nor does anyone close know anything about his move
 unni kii maut ke teen saal baad uske sharaabi or peshey se asafal patrkaar pita ke haath uski ek comics lagati he, jiske baad vah phir se unni kii aatmahatya kaa rahasy sujhalane main jute jaataa he
 The same question keeps popping into his mind all the time as to why he killed himself
 jaise-jaise noval aage badhata he pathak unni kii jindagi, uske vichaaron, uske doston, uske banaae hue behtareen cartoons or aakhir main uski maut kii vajah se rou-ba-rou hote hai
 At the same time, his mother Maryamma is shown as a woman who loves her children very much
 lekin bachapan main hue ek haadase kii vajah se uskaa bartaav thodaa sa ajeeb ho jaataa he
 She often talks to the yellow walls of the kitchen and takes out her frustration
 mariammaa carch kii madad se ghar ke liye rashan kaa intjaam karti he or khaali vakt main apane pati yani ki osep chaako kii maut kii yojana banaati he
 He also has a younger brother, whose name is Thoma
 thoma umr ke us daur se guzar rahaa he jab har ladkaa jaldi se bada hokar dher saare paise kamanaa chahta he
 He dreams of big house, big car and beautiful wife
 thoma kaa kairactor kaaphi mjedaar he or vah pados main rahane vaali brahamn ladki mithili se pyaar karata he, jo umr main usase badi he
 Whenever there is mention of Thomas in the novel, readers cannot live without laughing
 lekhak manu joseph ne unni ke charitra ko uske doston, skool teacher, neuroscientist doctor ingar, mariammaa, thoma or mithili ke shabdon main badi hi khubsuurati se dikhaaya he
 He is not alive, but still the reader falls in love with him
 is noval kii ek khaas baat yah bhi he ki mannu joseph ne dimag ke manovigyaan ko samajhane ke liye kaaphi research kii he
 Though it is worthy, but due to this, the story seems a bit drawn
 kahani main kai gudh manovaigyanik baaten he, lekin nijee taur par mere liye choti-choti chijen zyada myne rakhti hai
 During the course of the story, Osep Chacko meets his son's friend, who starts telling him about him
 tabhi osep man main sochataa he ki use apane hi bete ko jaanane ke liye kisi or kii madad leni pad rahi he
 His mind wakes up for his son

 "the Congress president wrote that MNREGA would have spent one year on such a rupee, the debt of farmers of three states would have been forgiven, 40 new AIIMS hospitals would have opened in the country
" aapako bataa den ki rahul gandhi pichley kaaphi samay se modi sarkaar par kuch chuninda udyogpatiyon kaa karj maaf karne kaa aarope laga rahe hai

 co / z24c2is7xb— Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) December 31, 2018 The Congress is upbeat by defeating the Bharatiya Janata Party in three states
 jeet hasil karne ke baad congress ne apane chunavi vaade ko nibhaate hue chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh or rajasthan main kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya
 Now it is pressurizing the central government to do the same
 haalanki, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne beete dinon main rahul gandhi ke chaukeedaar vaale aaropon par palatwaar kiya he
 At rallies in Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, the Prime Minister had said that some people are scared of the watchman, so today are abusing him
 gajipur kii raily main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki chaukeedaar ne din-raat mehnat kii he, isi kaaran kuch logon ko chintaa ho rahi he
 The PM had also termed the debt waiver plan of the Congress as a deception by the farmers
 madhya pradesh ke harda main ek naaballig ladki ne apane hi pita par chhedchhad or shaareerik shoshan karne kaa sansanikhej aarope lagaaya he
 The most surprising thing in this case is that the mother has also supported her father in this crime
 peedita beti kii shikaayat par police ne aaropee pita ke khilaaf cese darj karte hue maa ko bhi aaropee banaaya he
 Additional Superintendent of Police Kiranlata Kirkatta said that a case has been registered against her stepfather Dayaram (55), mother Sundarbai (49) under sections 363, 354 of the IPC and Posco Act on the complaint of a 17-year-old teenager living in Timarni
 iske saath hi balshram karaane ke aarope main thekedaar kamalesh ke khilaaf bhi cese darj he
 He said that the three accused in this case have been arrested
 ladki ke pita ne kuch din pehle thane main unki beti ko indore main beche jane kii shikaayat kii thi
 The police found the girl working at Kamlesh in Indore and freed her

 We have also been telling that if Sachin used to step back and defend instead of a cover drive, he would not have been out
 khayr, abhi to main worldcup dekh rahaa hum
 India has washed away Pakistan and South Africa
 bharat ko abhi chaar pool match or ek quarter final match khelnaa he, lekin meri najar to 26 march ko hone vaale match par lagi he
 This is the second semi-final of the tournament
 jisamen bharat pahonchega
 Now you are thinking that the quarter-finals before the semi-finals are also a knockout match
 lekin mere liye vah chintaa kaa vishay nahin he
 Let me tell you why - Pool A: The fate of Bangladesh is brightened
 australia ke viruddh uskaa match barish main dhul gaya or use ek point mil gaya
 Now if any match of England goes to rain or Bangladesh defeats it, then it will be a contender to reach the quarter-finals with better run average
 das din ke khel ke baad andaaj lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pool e main bangladesh chauthe number par rahegi, jabaki england, scotland or afghanistan toornament se baahar ho jaaengi
 Pool B: There is nothing left for Pakistan in this tournament
 uskaa baahar hona tay he
 However, some people in Pakistan are still confident that their team will do wonders
 1992 vishwacap main bhi kaaphi peeche se upar ai thi or vishwa vijeta bani thi
 But people are silencing those who say that Imran Khan was the captain of the team
 ab misbah hai
 They may also lose to Ireland and Zimbabwe
 yadi pakistan, west indies or ireland ke ank baraabar ho gaye to bhi ran rate pakistan kaa sabase bura hoga
 Then Pakistan, UAE and Zimbabwe will be out of the tournament
 nock out:abhi tak hue maichon ke hisaab se chaaron quarter final ke liye linep lagbhag taiyaar he
 1
 newjiland-ireland2
 South africa-sri Lanka 3
 australia-west indies4
 According to the india-bangladesh lineup, it is not difficult to guess the semi-final picture
 pehla semifinal hoga 24 march ko oakland main newjiland or south africa ke bich
 Even New Zealand will play all their matches in their own country
 aashcharya nahin hoga ki yah team semifinal tak kaa apana safar aparajit rup se tay kare
 As it happened in 1992
 doosraa semifinal hoga 26 march ko sidney main
 Between Australia and India
 ab iske aage akl kaam nahin kar rahi
 Have been in Australia for three months
 is dauraan australia ne hamen test or van-de tri siries main ekatarfa haraaya
 So what to say now
 semifinal he mauka? Where people are facing long queues to withdraw money from banks and atms, the same Kejriwal government will also give Rs 10,000 cash to its employees so that people do not have to face trouble, which later in November salary Can be adjusted
 lekin iskaa phayda sirf non gajted karmchaariyon ke liye hi he
 The government has given facilities to the employees so that the employees of the Delhi government do not have to be attacked
 notebandi ko lekar modi sarkaar logon kii pareshaani karne ke liye roj roj nae nae niyam laa rahi he, taaki logon kii pareshaani kam ho
 You can withdraw only 24000 rupees from salary account
 isse pehle modi sarkaar bhi kendriya karmchaariyon ko bhi 1 xxrep 4 0 rupee cash de rahi he to vahiin haryana sarkaar ne bhi apnikarmchaarionko ye suvidha di he

 Afghanistan is also gradually strengthening its identity as the newest entry

 At the same time, Bangladesh has been considered a 'hidden ruse' since the beginning

 Although India has maintained its dominance in the Asian derby, Bangladesh have raised their level of play considerably

 This win rate is 71%
 jeet pratishat ke hisaab se iske baad bangladesh (55%) or pakistan (54%) kaa number aata he
 The most surprising is the 1996 World Cup champion Sri Lanka's decline in the level of play in the last four years
 srilanka ne is dauraan anya asian deshon ke kilaaf khele gaye 29 maichon main se sirf 8 main jeet kaa munh dekha
 Sri Lanka's win percentage is just 28% and it is also behind Afghanistan
 afghanistan ne 2015 world cap ke baad asian deshon ke kilaaf 9 match khele or 3 main jeet hasil kii
 Not only this, Afghanistan also managed to tie the match against a strong team like India in Asia Cup 2018

 - digvijaya singh (@ digvijaya_28) February 22, 2017 Let it be said that Digvijay Singh created a panic by tweeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the same manner
 unhone twit kiya- modi ji- 'main desh ke liye gadhe ke mafik kaam kar rahaa hum
 'yes, you have done a fine job Modi ji, you are doing absolutely like a donkey!' There has been uproar after Digvijay Singh
 modi ji- "main desh ke liye gadhe ke mafiq kaam kar rahaa hum"ji hon aapane modi ji thik fermaaya aap bilkul gadhe ke mafiq kaam kar rahe hai !— digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28)february 24, 2017 In the Prem Nagar area of central Delhi, a teenager has been arrested for the murder of his sister-in-law and his four-year-old son
 police ne jaankaree di ki kishor ne apni bhabhi ke saath rape kii koshish kii thi jiskaa usne virodh kiya tha
 Due to this, he killed the woman
 aaropee kishor mujffarpur ke bihar kaa rahane vaala he or vah is ilaake main sabji bechaa karata tha
 He was living with the victim's family for the last 20 days
 police ne bataaya ki 26 varshiya mahila or uske chaar saal ke bete kaa shav kiraaye ke ek makaan main mila tha
 The woman's throat was cut with a sharp thing and her son's body was hung from the fan
 jaanch ke dauraan police ne paaya ki kishor hi vah aakhri vyakti tha, jois ghar main aayaa tha
 Police also found a selfie from the woman's mobile phone which was taken by the teenager on Thursday afternoon just before the incident
 dipti police kamishnar mandeep singh randhaava ne kaha, "aaropee vyakti ke sharir par kuch choton, pairon main kaatane, chehre, gardan or peeth par kharonch ke nishaan paae jane ke baad police ne giraftaar kiya he
 "during interrogation, Kishore revealed that on the day of the incident, he tried to assault the woman, which he strongly opposed
 is sab main uske chehre, gardan or sharir ke anya hisson par maamuli chotein ain hai
 Police said he also hit the woman with a stone, rendering her unconscious
 is bich, baccha jaag gaya or jab usne aaropee se kaha ki vah apane pita ko is ghatana ke bare main batayega to usne bachche kaa galaa ghont diya
 As he was trying to hang the child from the fan, the woman became aware and cut the leg of the accused to save the son
 disipi ne kaha ki aaropee ne chaaku se mahila kaa galaa kaatane ke baad bachche ko faansee par lataka diya
 He then washed away the blood stains and went out of the house
 adhikari ne kaha ki ghatana ko anjaam dene ke baad kishor do se teen ghante tak bhatakta rahaa
 Police recovered a pendant of the accused, a stone, a knife and a soap used to wash blood stains from the scene of the incident
 rashtriya swanyasevak sangh kaa maananaa he ki vot bank, mazahabi aarakshan or tushtikaran kii raajnneeti ke chalate bharat main muslim samaaj ke astitv ko hi khatra banataa ja rahaa he
 In an article in the RSS mouthpiece Panchajanya, it was warned that as the proportion of religious reservation increases, the respect of those who avail of the reservation will decrease
 jab bahusankhyak samaaj ke logon kii tulana main aarakshan ke aadhaar par kisi mazahab vishesh ke logon ko zyada diya jayega, to saamaajik samarasata or sauhaard ko taar-taar hone se koi bhi kanoon roak nahin sakegaa
 It says that this is a process of social psychology that the perceived minorities should understand in the interest of themselves and the country
 lekh main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki hindutv ke kaaran bharat main hajaaron vashare se saikadon mazahabon or jatiyon ko purna swatantraaa di ja rahi he
 As long as the ideological national base with the vast and all-encompassing vision of Hindutva will be safe, this freedom will also survive
 shart yah he ki ye mazahab or jatiyaan apane ko di jane vaali dheron suvidhaon kii aad main raashtra kii mukhyadhara se takaraane kii chahat chhod den
 It has been said to the Muslims, 'fortunately, the national awakening happening in the present time has provided such an opportunity to the Muslim brothers to clean up the past mistakes
 apane aapako raashtra kii mukhyadhara se jod saken
 The religion and tradition they follow is not their own accepted religion
 vah to videshi hamalaavaron kii ore se talwaar ke jor par un par thopa gaya he
 Our Muslim brothers should understand these truths in the interest of the nation and themselves and contribute to nation building
 ’sangh ke mukhpatr ne is naseehat main aage kaha he, vartmaan main ho rahe deshvyapee rashtrajagran ke sanket samajhakar bhartiya muslim samaaj ke adhikansh netaa samajhane lage hai ki ab hindu samaaj bhi pehle jaisaa kamazor, shaktiheen or asangathit nahin rahaa
 Muslims should mold their religion in the context of new conditions and India
 musalamaanon ke pichhadepan kaa ullekh karte hue lekh main kaha gaya he ki vot bank kii khatir muslim samaaj ko vishesh raajnneetik jhund banaakar rakhane vaali maukaparast congress jaise kathith secularavaadi dal hi musalamaanon kii kathith garibi or pichhadepan ke liye jimmedaar hai
 In this context, targeting the Congress President, it has been said that today's Sonia Gandhi was directed by Dr
 Sonia Gandhi of India's foreign conspiracies to divide India's cultural nationalism
 manmohan singh ke netritv vaali sarkaar puraa karne ko utaavali ho rahi he
 Under this, preparations have been made to carry out dangerous games like religion based reservation to give constitutional support to minorityism

 ye hamaare maanviya mulyon ke liye bhi mahatvapurn he
 This will be the India of our dreams
 ek aisa bharat, jo sabhi ko samaan avasar sunishchit karegaa
 Such India will be the India of the 21st century
 desh kaa har naagarik raashtra nirmaataa he
 Each one of us is a patron of Indian traditions and values and we will pass on this legacy to future generations
 desh kii simaaon kii raksha karne vaale or hamen surakshit rakhane vaale sashastr bal, raashtra nirmaataa hai
 The police and paramilitary forces, fighting terrorism and crimes, are nation builders
 jo kisaan tapati dhoop main desh ke logon ke liye ann upja rahaa he, wo raashtra nirmaataa he, or hamen ye bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie, ki khet main kitni badi sankhya main mahilaayein bhi kaam karti hai
 The scientist who has been working tirelessly for 24 hours, taking Indian space missions to Mars, or inventing a vaccine, is a nation builder
 jo nurse yaa doctor sudur kisi gaanv main, kisi marij kii gambhir beemaari se ladane main uski madad kar rahe hai, wo raashtra nirmaataa hai
 The young man who started his start-up and has now become a self-employed donor is a nation builder
 ye start-ap kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 In a small farm, it may be the work of making pickles out of mangoes, weaving carpets in a village of artisans or a laboratory, which is illuminated with large screens
 wo adivasee or saamaanya naagarik, jo jalwaayu parivartan kii chunautiyon se nipatane main hamaare paryaavaran, hamaare wanon, hamaare vanya jivan kii raksha kar rahe hai or ve log jo navikarniya urja ke mahatva ko badhaava de rahe hai, ve raashtra nirmaataa hai
 VIDEO: Ramnath Kovind's swearing-in ceremony, committed public servants who are performing their duties with full devotion, controlling traffic on a water-filled road, sitting in a room and working on files, Huh
 wo shikshak, jo ni:swaarth bhav se yuvaaon ko disha de rahe hai, unka bhavishya tay kar rahe hai, ve raashtra nirmaataa hai
 The countless women who take care of their families at home and outside, along with all the responsibilities, making their children the ideal citizens of the country, they are nation builders
 desh ke naagarik gram panchayat se lekar sansad tak apane pratinidhi chunate hai, un pratinidhiyon main apni aasthaa or ummid jataate hai
 To fulfill the expectations of the citizens, these people's representatives spend their lives in the service of the nation
 lekin hamaare ye prayaas sirf hamaare liye hi nahin hai
 For centuries, India has relied on the philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, the whole world is one family
 ye uchit hoga ki ab bhagwaan buddha kii ye dharti, shanti kii sthapana or paryaavaran kaa santulan banane main vishwa kaa netritv karen
 Today, India's vision is important all over the world
 puraa vishwa bhartiya samskruti or bhartiya paramparaon kii taraf aakarshith he
 The world community is looking to us for solutions to international problems
 chaahe aatankwaad ho, kaledhan kaa len-dein ho yaa phir jalwaayu parivartan
 Our responsibilities in the global scenario have also gone global
 yahi bhav hamen, hamaare vaishvik parivaar se, videsh main rahane vaale mitron or sahyogiyon se, duniya ke alag-alag kshetron main rahakar apana yogadan de rahe pravasi bharatiyon se jodta ha
 
 yahi bhav hamen duusare deshon kii sahaayta ke liye tatpar karata he, chaahe wo antarrashtriya solar alliance kaa vistaar karnaa ho, yaa phir prakritik aapadaaon ke samay, sabase pehle sahyog ke liye aage aana ho
 The comments ek raashtra ke taur par hamane bahut kuch hasil kiya he, lekin isse bhi or adhik karne kaa prayaas, or behatar karne kaa prayaas, or teji se karne kaa prayaas, nirantar hote rahanaa chahie
 This is also important because in the year 2022, the country will be celebrating the 75th year of its independence
 hamen is baat kaa lagaataar dhyaan rakhana hoga ki hamaare prayaas se samaaj kii aakhri pankti main khadey us vyakti ke liye, or garib parivaar kii us aakhri beti ke liye bhi nai sambhaavnaaon or nae avasaron ke dwaar khulen
 Our efforts should reach the last house of the last village
 isamen nyaay pranali ke har str par, teji ke saath, kam kharch par nyaay dilaane vaali vyavastha ko bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 The citizens of this country are the primary source of our energy
 main puri tarah aashwast hum ki raashtra kii seva ke liye, mujhe in logon se isi prakaar nirantar shakti milti rahegi
 We must build a fast-growing economy, an educated, ethical and shared community, a society with equal values and equal opportunities
 ek aisa samaaj jisaki kalpana mahatma gandhi or deen dayaal upaadhyaay ji ne kii thi
 It is also important for our human values
 ye hamaare sapanom kaa bharat hoga
 An India that will ensure equal opportunities for all
 aisa hi bharat, 21veen sadi kaa bharat hoga

 The citizens of the country choose their representatives from the Gram Panchayat to the Parliament, expressing their faith and hope in those representatives
 nagarikon kii ummiido ko puraa karne ke liye yahi janpratinidhi apana jivan raashtra kii seva main lagaate hai
 But these efforts are not just for us
 sadiyon se bharat ne vasudaiv kutunbakam, yani puraa vishwa ek parivaar he, ke darshan par bharosa kiya he
 It would be appropriate that now this earth of Lord Buddha lead the world in establishing peace and balancing the environment
 aaj puure vishwa main bharat ke drushtikon kaa mahatva he
 The whole world is attracted towards Indian culture and Indian traditions
 vishwa samudaay antarrashtriya samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye hamaari taraf dekh rahaa he
 Be it terrorism, black money transactions or climate change
 vaishvik paridrishy main hamaari jimmedaariyaan bhi vaishvik ho gai hai
 This sentiment connects us to our global family, to friends and colleagues living abroad, to overseas Indians living in different regions of the world
 
 This sentiment prepares us to help other countries, whether it is to expand the International Solar Alliance, or to come forward to cooperate first in times of natural disasters
 tippaniyan We have achieved a lot as a nation, but the effort to do more than that, and the effort to do better, and to do faster, must be continuous
 ye isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki varsh 2022 main desh apni swatantraaa ke 75wein saal kaa parv manaa rahaa hoga
 We have to keep in mind that through our efforts, the doors of new possibilities and new opportunities open up for the person standing in the last line of society, and also for that last daughter of poor family
 hamaare praytn aakhri gaanv ke aakhri ghar tak pahunchane chahie
 It should also include a system that provides speedy justice at all levels of justice, at a rapid pace
