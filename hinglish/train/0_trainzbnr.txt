 During the hearing in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, the Kerala government agreed to stand by its side
 kerala sarkaar ne mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki sarkaar har umr kii mahilaon ke pravesh ke samarthan main he
 At the same time, on this stand of the government, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra raised the question and said that this is the fourth time you have changed the stand
 justise rohington ne kaha ki kerala vakt ke saath badal rahaa he
 Significantly, in 2015 the Kerala government supported the entry of women but in 2017 it changed its stand
 jiske baad ab phir usne sahmati jataai he
 The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard a case related to the ban on entry of women in the age group of 10 to 50 years in the historic Sabarimala temple in Kerala
 chif justise ne sunwaayee ke dauraan tippanee main kaha ki desh main privet mandir kaa koi siddhant nahin he or mandir privet sampatti nahin he ye sawarjanik sampatti he
 The Chief Justice said, "if the man is allowed to enter public property, then the woman should also be allowed to enter
" ek baar mandir khulata he to usamen koi bhi ja saktaa he
 'explain that the management of the Sabarimala temple situated on the hill of the Western Ghats in Pathanamthitta district had earlier told the apex court that they could not maintain' purity 'because of menstruation, hence the entry of women in the age group of 10 to 50 It is forbidden in the temple
 is maamle main saat november, 2016 ko kerala sarkaar ne nyaayalay ko suchit kiya tha ki vah aitihaasik sabarimala mandir main sabhi aayu varg kii mahilaon ke pravesh ke paksh main he
 Initially, the state's LDF government took a progressive stand in 2007 to support the entry of women into the temple, which was replaced by the Congress-led UDF government
 udief sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki vah 10 se 50 aayu varg kii mahilaon kaa pravesh varjit karne ke paksh main he kyonki yah parpanra ati pracheen kaal se chali aa rahi he
 Now the Kerala government has once again agreed to the entry of women in the temple, keeping their side in the Supreme Court

 The Maharashtra government took this decision in a cabinet meeting held on Thursday
 rajya ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan samvaadadaata sammelan main kah chuke hai kii vah is faisle ko tatkaal prabhaav se lagu karne ja rahe hai
 Earlier, the state government said that Marathas and Muslims in Maharashtra will now be counted as backward
 maraathon ko 16 fisad to musalamaanon ko 5 fisad aarakshan hoga jo rajya sarkaar kii naukariyon or shiksha sansthaanon main lagu hoga
 With this decision of the state government, the structure of reservation in Maharashtra is changing
 isse pehle rajya main kul 52 fisadi aarakshan tha
 This includes 16 per cent for Scheduled Castes, 7 per cent for Scheduled Tribes, 19 per cent for obcs, 11 per cent for Orthodox castes and 2 per cent reservation for Special Backward Classes
 is aarakshan main nae aarakshan ko jodne ke baad maharashtra main aarakshan kaa pratishat 73 fisadi ho gaya he
 This makes Maharashtra the second largest reservation granting state in the country after Tamil Nadu
 lekin, is faisle kaa virodh bhi shuru ho gaya he
 Journalist Ketan Tirodkar has filed a petition in the Bombay High Court seeking a stay on the verdict
 enditivi se baatcheet ke dauran kethan ne kaha kii, 'tay maanakon se zyada aarakshan dene se maharashtra sarkaar ko roka janaa chahie
 'along with this, Tirodkar has opposed the government's call for Maratha society to be backward
 unka kahana he kii rajya main 73 fisadi sansaadhan maraathon ke kabje main he
 In such a situation, it is not right to call them backward
 ' The Marathas constitute 34% of the population in Maharashtra based on the 2001 census
 is aabaadi kii saamaajik or vittiya sthiti jaanchane ke liye rajya sarkaar ne apane mantri narayan rane kii adhyakshata main samiti bhi banaai thi, jiske aadhaar par maratha samaaj ko pichhadaa maanane kii baat rajya kii congress ensipi sarkaar ne kii he
 At the same time, based on the recommendations of Ranganath Mishra Commission, Rajendra Sachar Commission and mehmood-ur-rehman Committee, the government has announced five percent reservation for Muslims
 muslim samaaj main is par alag-alag raay saamne aa rahi he
 Speaking to NDTV, Islamic scholar Zeenat Shaukat Ali said, 'elections are near
 aise main muslim votaron ko aakarshith karne kaa yah ek tarika he
 ' isi ke saath maharashtra bijepi adhyaksh devendra fadanvis ne elaan kiya he kii unki party rajya main musalamaanon ko aarakshan lagu nahin hone degi
 However, during this reservation dispute, a shocking statement came from NCP President Sharad Pawar
 pavaar ko jab ain chunaav se pehle is aarakshan kaa elaan karne kaa makasad poocha gaya to vah bol gaye kii, 'ham sant thode hi hai
 If we have taken decisions, we will use it in elections
 ' The electoral atmosphere in the country is hot

 They should not be given any government job
 'ramdev ne kaha tha ki unka mantra he jati, dharm yaa aarthik sthiti ke baavjood ham do, hamaare do, sabake do (prayek danpati ke liye do bachche)
 He had said, 'I want to see India as a superpower
 ham do, hamaare do
 No caste, no religion, no politics should come in the way of this resolution
 agar ham abhi sudharatmak upaay nahin karte hai, to jansankhya ek abhishaap ban jaaegi
 'during the Lok Sabha elections, Ramdev called BJP leader Sadhvi Pragya Thakur a nationalist and said that he was arrested and tortured inside the jail for nine years only on the basis of suspicion that he was a terrorist

 14 test main 51 wicket lekar vah sabase kam umr main 50 wicket lene vaale gendbaaj ban gaye
 At the same time, he also took 25 wickets in 15 odis
 lekin mohammad aamir kii duniya tab bikhar gai jab un paraspot phixingka aarope laga
 The charge was also proved and he was not only sentenced to 6 months in jail but was also banned for 5 years
 yah aisa haadasa tha maano ek chamchamaate sitare par grahan lag gaya ho
 But leaving everything behind, Mohammad Aamir is again coming back to make a mark in the cricket world
 international cricket council (isisi) dwaara ijaajat milane ke baad vah is samay pakistan main grad-2 cricket khel rahe hai
 Aamir was on the verge of a hat-trick in his first match while making a comeback, but he missed
 jis ridam or raftaar se gendbaaji karte hue vah dikhe, usase yahi lag rahaa he ki vah or majboot or shashakt ho kar vaapasi karne vaale hai
 Since Aamir has returned to the field after finishing his ban, he has been consistently doing better
 unhone 4 maichon main dhardaar gendbaaji karte hue 22 wicket jatke hai
 However, Aamir will have to wait for his return to international cricket
 kyonki unka bain 2 sitambar 2015 ko khatm ho rahaa he
 At the request of the Pakistan Cricket Board, the ICC has currently allowed Aamir to play only domestic cricket
 is saal disambar main bharat or pakistan ke bich siries hone kii sambhaavna he
 In such a situation, when asked if he would like to play a series against India
 to aamir kaa kahana tha ki bharat ke khilaaf khelnaa har pakistani kaa sapana hota he, or main bhi puri koshish karuunga ki phir se meri rashtriya team main vaapasi ho
 However, for Aamir, who is trapped in a spotty crime like spot fixing at the age of 18, it is not going to be easy
 jab unpar bain laga tha us samay vah apane form ke charam par the
 The first challenge before Aamir is to regain that kind of fitness and performance
 saath hi critics or phens kaa bhi unhen shikaar hona pad saktaa he
 Because of the kind of crime he is coming under, he will also have to face many sharp comments
 haalanki is baat se koi inkaar nahin he ki jo kuch bhi aamir ne kiya vah acha nahin tha
 But no one can deny the fact that Aamir came under the influence of someone and committed the crime
 westeindies ke purv diggaj tej gendbaaj maaikel holding bhi maanate hai ki ek nayaa-navela khilaadi jo ek maamuli gaanv se aayaa ho, england main jaakar spot phixing jaisaa sangeen aparaadh nahin kar saktaa
 Holding was about to cry, saying that someone wasted this tremendous talent
 baharhaal, jo hona tha wo ho chukaa he
 Now the wait is on Aamir's return to international cricket
 agar aamir maansik rup se majboot hokar lautenge to is baat main koi shaq nahin he ki vah ek baar phir apni chamak cricket ke maidan main bikher sakate hai
 But if he cannot remove the old things from his mind, then another star may have gone into a cloud
 bharat ne mangalvaar ko antarrashtriya samudaay se kaha ki aarthik protsaahanon ko jari rakhaa jaae kyonki aarthik gati sudhaarney main abhi lanbaa samay lagegaa
 Apart from this, India has called for reforms in the IMF and World Bank so that the economies of economy have a big role in the process of making economic policies

 Policy incentives are very important to drive improvement
 ' unhone kaha ki mudrasphiti ke jokhim or rajkoshiya sthirataa ke liye khatre ko dekhte hue protsaahan package ko santulit rakhane kii alpakaalik chunauti jarur he
 'according to him the timing and consequences of' withdrawal policies' have become important
 imef tathaa vishwa bank kii do divasiy baithak turki kii rajdhani main shuru hui
 This meeting will consider to overcome the crisis and strengthen the global financial system
 mukherjee ne kaha ki imef tathaa vishwa bank maujuuda aarthik sankat se bina badale nahin nikal sakate or bhavishya main vaishvik aarthik vikaas ke chaalak ke rup main agrani deshon kii bhoomika ko sweekaar karnaa hoga
 He said that opposition to the intended changes will only affect the legitimacy, credibility and influence of these institutions
 bas hafte bhar pehle kii baat he jab ek ajeebogareeb maamle main 80 saal kii ek bujurg mahila ko 'gandi gaaliyaan' dene ke aaropee tote ko saman bhejkar maharashtra ke chandrapur jile ke police thane talab kiya gaya tha
 Now a similar case has emerged
 abaki baar parbhani jile main police lock ap main ek bakrii ko rakhaa gaya he
 a complaint of animal theft was lodged at the police station on 20 August, after which the police seems to have recovered the goat
 police pashu chori ke maamle par harakat main ai or is bakrii ko ek aaropee ke kabje main paaya
 However, the police have kept both the goat and the accused in separate cells
 police stesan main 20 agast ko pashu chori kii shikaayat darj kii gai thi, lagata he ki isi ke baad police ne is bakrii ko baraamad kiya he
 The police took action on the case of animal theft and found this goat in the possession of one of the accused
 vaise police ne bakrii or aaropee, donon, ko alag alag cell main rakhaa he

 The war of words between two Union ministers Manohar Parrikar and Shripad Naik has started after former Congress MLA Pandurang Madkaikar joined the Goa BJP
 nike ne daawa kiya ki is bare main unase vichaar-vimarsh nahin kiya gaya
 "I was not consulted before deciding to allow Madkaikar to be inducted into the party," Naik said
 main is faisle ke paksh main nahin tha
 Naik's son Siddhesh was expected to get a ticket from Kumbharjua assembly constituency and Madakikar was representing from the same region before joining the BJP, in which Naik is obviously disappointed
 matkaikar pichley saptaah party main shaamil hue, jiske baad parrikar ne kumbharajua vidhansabha kshetra main yojit ‘vijay sankalp raily’ main apane sambodhan main yah saaf kaha tha ki teen baar ke vidhayak rahe matkaikar bhaajapa ke tikat par isi vidhansabha kshetra se chunaav ladenge
 However, while talking to media persons, Parrikar claimed that as far as Naik is concerned, he was fully taken into confidence before deciding to include Madkaikar
 baharhaal, kendriya aayush mantri nike ne daawa kiya ki unase sirf aupchaarikta ke taur par vimarsh kiya gaya tha
 He said he was informed after the decision was made
 tippaniyan "it is against the principles of the party to include someone in the party," Naik said
 main is maamle ko dilli main party netaaon ke samaksh uthaaungaa
 Madkaikar left the BJP to join the Congress and while leaving the Congress last week claimed that the Congress had no future in Goa
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) nike ne kaha, matkaikar ko party main shaamil kiye jane kii manjuuri kaa faisla lene se pehle mujhase vichaar-vimarsh nahin kiya gaya
 i was not in favor of this decision
 nike ke putr siddhesh ko kumbharajua vidhansabha kshetra se tikat milane kii ummid thi or bhaajapa main shaamil hone se pehle matkaikar isi kshetra se pratinidhitiv kar rahe the, aise main nike jaahir taur par niraash hai
 Madkaikar joined the party last week, after which Parrikar made it clear in his address at the 'vijay Sankalp Rally' held in Kumbharjua Assembly constituency that Madkikar, a three-time MLA, would contest from this constituency on a BJP ticket
 baharhaal, mediakarmiyon se baat karte hue parrikar ne daawa kiya ki ‘jahaan tak nike kaa sawaal he to matkaikar ko shaamil karne kaa faisla lene se pehle unhen puri tarah vishwaas main liya gaya tha
 However, Union Ayush Minister Naik claimed that they were discussed only as a formality
 unhone kaha ki faisla kiye jane ke baad unhen suchit kiya gaya tha
 The comments nike ne kaha, is tarah se kisi ko party main shaamil kiya janaa party ke siddhanton ke khilaaf he

 In the video, India's first Khilji ruler Jalaluddin Khilji is also seen for the first time

 No, Antony Kogetli made it clear that our target is not just Defense Minister AK Antony but the entire government
 unke mutabik sena ne bayaan diya ki pakistani sena ne hamalaa kiya
 This truth was changed by the Defense Minister and in his statement that the attackers were only in the uniform of Pakistani Army
 isi tarah doosraa bayaan tha ki elosi ke saath hua ye vakya
 Then changed it to say that it happened in the Indian territory
 bakaul jetali, iskaa laabh uthaakar pakistan ne dephence bana liya he
 They will say that it has happened within your border, if you have not crossed the border, then your Mujahideen must have been
 jetali ke mutabik ye bachaav kaa rasta dena samaj main aane vaala nahin he
 Embarrassed by Pakistan, Karojetli made it clear that Antony or the government's stand was not a mistake
 unke mutabik sarkaar apane bayaan, apane stand ko jaan boojhkar halkaa kar rahi he
 He said that there was an opportunity yesterday when the government would clearly embarrass Pakistan by taking the name of Pakistan in front of the whole world
 magar aisa nahin hua
 The government has to clear its stand in front of the country

 Attacking Antony's statement, Arun Jaitley said, "this statement only gives a way for Pakistan to escape
" pakistan pehle se daawa karata rahaa he ki bharat main hone vaali aatanki gatividhiyon se uskaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Whatever the terrorist incident, Pakistan's only answer is this
 1999 ke kargil yuddh ko hi le lijie
 Pakistan still does not accept those intruders as its own
 agar antni bhi is bhashaa main bolenge to paak ise chor raste kii tarah istemaal karegaa hi
 'arun Jaitley said,' Pakistani government talks about improving relations
 vahiin uski sena hamaare sainikon par hamale kar rahi he
 Is the Pakistani Army really disregarding its government or is it part of a well thought out strategy
 hamaare liye yah jaananaa jaruri he
 There should be a dialogue with Pakistan
 par yah is baat par nirbhar kare ki padosi mulk kaa ravaiya kaisaa he
 In the current situation, the government needs to give a befitting reply
 'unhone kaha, 'pakistan ko shaq kaa phayda nahin diya ja saktaa
 Returning from the Commonwealth Meet in Harare many years ago, the PM said that Pakistan is also the victim of terrorism
 shame al shaikh main hamane apni videsh niti main badlaav kiya
 Pakistan was asked to ensure that their land is not used to promote terror in India
 isi sthiti main donon deshon ke bich vaarta aage badi
 But the situation has not changed even today
 paak kii dharti par ab bhi hamaare desh ke khilaaf sajishein rachi ja rahi hai
 'did the SP MP Ram Gopal Yadav's statement of the Minister be disappointing? hamaari seemaa par china or pakistan kii taraf se ghatnaayen ho rahi hai
 They are breaking the morale of the people of the country, the army and the forces
 ham is sthiti main nahin he, netritv is sthiti main nahin he ki ham pakistan yaa china kii sarkaar se thik dhang se majbootee se apni baat kah saken
 The leader of the opposition gave a way to escape by saying that he would talk to Pakistan in the beginning
 unhone sena ke logon ko maaraa
 You are saying that the terrorists killed
 vahi to ye bhi kah rahe hai
 You gave way to avoid your statement
 ham unase kuch kah hi nahin sakate hai

 After a 45-minute meeting with Manmohan Singh, Bukhari said, "we had a great meeting
 hamane dwipaksheeya muddon par charchaa kii
 It is a positive thing that the two countries are negotiating so that relations improve

 ’ The Gujarat board's 10th results were announced on Thursday
 sirf 54 pratishat bachche hi parikshaw paas kar sake
 These results are being called the worst results of 10 years
 bacchon ne bataaya ki is saal ganit kaa paper bahut kathin gaya tha jisaki vajah se bacchon kaa parinaam gadabada gaya
 Many children were seen crying at the result
 pichley saal parinaam 64 pratishat ke kareeb aae the
 Every year more than 10 lakh children appear for the 10th exam, in such a case, the result is less, the failure of millions of children
 mahatvapurn he ki isse pehle 12veen science or 12veen commers ke nattejey bhi bahut hi bure rahe hai
 The comments 12veen science ke kareeb 84 pratishat nattejey rahe the jo pichley saal se 8 pratishat kam the or 12veen commers ke 54 fisadi nattejey rahe the jo pichley 20 saal kaa sabase pura parinaam bataaya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the question arises that in education sector, is the level of education falling further backward in Gujarat? jaankaar kehete hai ki is baar 10veen ke bure nattejey ke liye zarur hi ganit kaa kathin paper kaaran rahaa he
 But such bad results are a matter of concern
 lekin saath hi ye bhi ki is baar parikshaw ke dauraan chori rokane ke liye kade kadam uthaaye gayi the isaliye bhi kam bachche paas hue hai
 So were the good results in the last years due to theft? There is no answer to this
 lekin ek baat zyaadaatar jaankaar maanate hai ki rajya main shiksha par jitani jarurat he utana dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa he
 Last year, the results were close to 64 percent
 har saal 10 lakh se zyada bachche 10veen kii pariksha dete hai, aise main parinaam kam aana matlab lakhon bacchon kaa fail hona
 It is important that before this the results of 12th Science and 12th Commerce have also been very bad
 tippaniyan 12th Science had about 84 percent results, which was 8 percent less than last year and 54 percent results for 12th Commerce, which is said to be the best result of last 20 years
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki shiksha ke kshetra main pichde gujarat main kya shiksha kaa str or gir rahaa he? Experts say that this time the difficult paper of mathematics has definitely been the reason for the bad result of 10th class
 lekin itane bure parinaam chintaa kii baat he
 But at the same time, during this time, strict steps were taken to prevent theft, so even fewer children have passed
 to kya pichley saalon main jo achche parinaam rahe wo chori kii vajah se the? iskaa koi jawaab nahin he
 But one thing most experts believe that education is not being given as much attention as is needed in the state
 12veen science ke kareeb 84 pratishat nattejey rahe the jo pichley saal se 8 pratishat kam the or 12veen commers ke 54 fisadi nattejey rahe the jo pichley 20 saal kaa sabase pura parinaam bataaya ja rahaa he

 mayawati ne kaha ki modi ne 2 saal tak muslim or daliton par ho rahe atyaacharon par chuppi saadhe rakhi or ab neend khuli he to aise bayaan de rahe hai
 Mayawatika says that Modi is doing all this in view of the election because the election is on the head
 isliye inke yah bayaan raajnneeti se prerit he
 After 2 years, Modi remembers Dalits
 mayawati kaa kahana he ki daliton ko bijepi se sahanubhuti nahin chahie balki vah to criminal ke khilaaf karrwai chaahate hai
 Mayawati says that Dalits are being persecuted constantly in the name of cow protection but BJP and PM Modi are not taking any action

 vipaksh modi ke in bayanon ko uttar pradesh chunaav se jodakar dekh rahaa he
 The opposition believes that the incident with Dalits in Gujarat's Una should not harm the BJP, hence the Prime Minister has criticized the oppression of Dalits in the name of cow protection
 iske saath hi sangh ne bhi pradhanmantri ke bayaan kaa samarthan karte hue kaha he ki gauraksha ke naam par atyaachaar nahin hona chahie

 The dominance of Allahabad University, formerly known as Oxford, is rising again in the examination of UPSC
 2010 main UPSC kii mukhya pariksha main badlaav karne se elahabaad main taiyaari karne vaale chaatro kaa upiessi main safal hone kaa silsilaa lagbhag khatm sa ho gaya tha
 But the arrival of two students from Allahabad from the top five of this year's UPSC exam has boosted the morale of the students preparing for Allahabad
 elahabaad kii saumya pandeya ne chauthaa sthaan or abhilash ne paanchavaa sthaan praapt karke elahabaad main taiyaari kar rahe kareeb das hajaar chaatro ke sapanom ko nai udaan de di he
 Soumya Pandey, who succeeded in her first attempt by engineering from Allahabad, says that everyone used to advise her to go to Delhi for the preparation of UPSC
 isi ke chalate teen din dilli main rahakar unhone koching class bhi lee
 But the atmosphere of Delhi did not go well, then he decided to come to Allahabad and prepare
 dhyey iees koching main bhugol or general study kii do saal tak taiyaari kii
 The result is in front of everyone
 upiessi kii taiyaari ke liye ab tak dilli ko sabase zyada mufeed mana jaataa rahaa he
 But this year, no candidate from Delhi could make his place in the top five in the UPSC examination
 jabaki elahabaad ke kareeb pachaas se zyada chaatr upiessi pariksha main baaji maari he
 QH Khan, director of Dhyeya Coaching Center, says that earlier students preparing in Allahabad used to pay more attention to optional subjects
 tippaniyan Due to this, when the pattern changed, Allahabad students fell behind
 lekin beete paanch saalon main elahabaad ke chaatr samaj chuke hai ki ab upiessi kii pariksha main safal hone kaa ek maatr sutara jaankaree nahin he balki kisi bhi vishay kaa aalochanatmak vishleshan karnaa bhi he
 Manik Mishra of Allahabad, who has been successful in UPSC, says that earlier most of the faculty who guided him lived in Delhi
 isi ke chalate chaatr taiyaari karne ke liye dilli jate the
 But now there are three to four study centers in Allahabad itself, where all the faculty come from Delhi to Allahabad to guide the students here
 upiessi pariksha main chaatro kaa rujhaan jaise-jaise bad rahaa he koching karaane waalon kii taadaat main bhi ijapha ho rahaa he
 At present, there are about one hundred and fifty coaching centers in Allahabad, but there are three to four such centers, which are taught by people from Delhi and online study materials are now being provided to the students, students of small and medium cities are also playing their sting

 But in the last five years, the students of Allahabad have understood that now the only formula to succeed in UPSC exam is not only information but also to do a critical analysis of any subject

 Due to this, students used to go to Delhi to prepare
 lekin ab elahabaad main hi teen se chaar study centre aise hai jahaan kii sari faikalti dilli se elahabaad aakar yahaan ke chaatro kaa maargdarshan karti he
 As the trend of students in UPSC exams is increasing, the number of coaching students is also increasing

 ek garib ko sirf isliye marane diya kyunki uske paas modi kaa ayushmaan card tha par aspataal rahul gandhi kaa tha
 "he said in another tweet," Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra, trustees of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, reply to Amethi - why was an innocent killed? "modi also raised this issue at an election rally in Gwalior
 It was that a patient in a hospital belonging to the Gandhi family was returned saying that it is not Modi's hospital where the Ayushman card runs
 haalanki, aspataal prashasan ne in aaropon ko raajnneeti se prerit bataate hue kaha tha ki musafirkhaana kshetra ke saraiya gaanv kaa nivasee rahaa marij nanhe laal behad gambheer haalat main aspataal laayaa gaya tha
 He was given all possible better treatment but due to lack of necessary facilities in the hospital, he was advised to go to Lucknow

 lekin ise banane kaa idia 1999 main indian academy of sciensej (IAS) main aayaa tha
 Subsequently in 2000, it was agreed to by the Astronautical Society of India
 phir isro neshnal lunar mishan task force banaai, jisamen desh ke kai bade vaigyanik shaamil the

 a number of remote sensing devices were created for this
 saath hi pehali baar deep spes network (DSN) kii jarurat mahasoos hui, kyonki pehali baar bharat kaa koi mishan antariksh main itani dur ja rahaa tha
 a deep space network with large antennae was then created to establish connectivity in remote space

 It was a big deal at that time
 isiilie, is rocket ko chunaa gaya
 But there was little change
 taaki chandrayan-1 ke vajan ko vah uthaa sake

 Chandrayaan-1 worked for about 11 months
 zyada radiation kii vajah se chandrayan-1 main power supplai baadhit ho gai or isamen lage computaron ne kaam karnaa band kar diya tha
 Because of which it lost contact with Earth's Deep Space Network
 ye kaisaa inaam? Chandrayaan-2 se pehle sarkaar ne kaati ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaahchandrayan-1 ko 2 saal kaam karnaa tha
 But it only worked for 11 months

 - input language jis tarah south africa isisi toornaments main chokars sabit hui he, lagbhag vahi haal royal chalangers bangaleru kaa indian premier lig (ipel) main he
 The RCB team has been one of the strongest teams in the IPL since its inception
 pehle sanskaran se hi is team main ek se badhkar sitare khele hai
 But the interesting thing is that his performance was not the kind that everyone expected
 aaie ipel main bangaleru ke ab tak ke safar par ek najar daalate hai
 In 2008, Bangalore stood the Test team at number 7
 
 Royal Challengers Bangalore took the field under the captaincy of Rahul Dravid in the first edition of IPL
 jaik kallis, mark bouchar, del sten, misbah ul haq, ross tailor, camerun white, shivnarayan chandrpaul, anil kumble or jahir khan jaise diggaj khilaadi bangaleru kii team kaa hissaa bane
 But this team adorned with superstar players could win only 4 of their 14 matches
 darasal T20 cricket ke hisaab se yah team bilkul upyukt sabit nahin hui, or 7wein sthaan par rahi
 Luck changed in 2009, but lost in the finals
 
 Royal Challengers Bangalore changed the 2008 team to include Robin Uthappa, Ryloff Vander Merv, Jesse Ryder and Kevin Pietersen in 2009
 shuruuaati maichon ke liye kevin petersan ko team kii kaman di gai, lekin westeindies ke khilaaf siries ke chalate petersan ko bich main hi waapas lautnaa padaa
 After this, the team's command was given to Anil Kumble
 2009 main loksabhaa chunaav or suraksha kaarnon se ipel ko south africa shift kar diya gaya
 The change in venue also brought a change in the fortunes of Bangalore and they made it to the finals
 lekin final main unhen deccan chargers ke haathon haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa, or trophy kaa sapana adhura hi rah gaya
 Having made it to the semi-finals in 2010
 
 In 2010, Royal Challengers Bangalore was once again commanded by Anil Kumble
 2009 ke lagbhag saare diggaj 2010 kii is team main maujuud the
 But in view of the demand for T20, England's Ain Morgan and South Africa's Dillon du Preez were included in the squad
 bangaleru ne apane 14 main 7 match jite or semifinal main jagah banaai
 But the series of missed chances on big occasions continued in 2010 too, and RCB were knocked out of the title race after losing by 35 runs to Mumbai in the semi-finals
 2011 main phir pahunche final main, lekin phir bane chokar
 
 2011 main vyapak badlaav karte hue royal chalangers bangaleru ne kris gail, tillakaratne dilashaan, abi divilliars, dark nainess or danniel vittori ko team main shaamil kiya
 Vettori was given the command of the team
 puure sijan team kaa pradarshan laajawab rahaa
 But RCB surrendered once again in the final
 final main inkaa muqabla emes dhoni kii team chennai super kings se tha
 Chennai batting first scored 205 runs
 jiske jawaab main bangaleru kii team maatr 147 ran par ludhak gai
 Also could not make it to the play offs in 2012, 2013 and 2014
 
 After losing in the finals in 2011, the Bangalore team failed to make it to the play-offs in 2012, 2013 and 2014 as well
 aisa nahin he ki team kamjor thi
 Gale, de Villiers, Virat Kohli, Muralitharan and Yuvraj were part of the team
 lekin bade maukon par aakar chukne kaa silsilaa thama nahin
 What will the title wait for in 2015? In 2015, Royal Challengers Bangalore are again taking the field under the captaincy of Virat Kohli
 gail or divilliars ke upar se dabaav hataane ke liye is baar na sirf kai videshi diggajon ko shaamil kiya gaya he, balki gharelu khilaadiyon ke pool ko bhi majboot kiya gaya he

 vahiin gharelu khilaadiyon main es badrinaath, dinesh karthik, ikbaal abdulla or mandeep singh jaise khilaadi team ke vikalpon ko kholenge
 However, the absence of injured Mitchell Starc and Adam Milne has weakened rcb's bowling

 While Prime Minister Narendra Modi's informal visit to China is raising questions from other opposition parties, including Congress, now bjp's ally Shiv Sena has also surrounded the Modi government on this issue
 shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main kaha gaya he ki purv pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru kaa vichaar tha- yuddh nahin, par buddha hona chahie' or piem modi ko yahi vichaar raas aa gaya he
 During the visit to China, it has been written that PM Modi has not talked about terrorism and border violation there
 ye bhi likhaa he ki pakistan ke aatankwaad ko china paal rahaa he, lekin china ke raashtrapati shi jinping se charchaa ke dauraan piem modi ne ek shabd nahin bolaa
 It is also written in the face that PM Modi needs peace on the border of China
 piem modi kii niti ko chunaav se jodate hue likhaa gaya, 'ek baar chunaav hone do phir use dekhne vaali piem modi kii niti dikhaai de rahi he
 In Nehru's face, Modi was seen to be costly, PM Modi was seen connecting Jawaharlal Nehru and China friendship
 likhaa gaya he ki pandit nehru ko china se dosti mahangi padi thi
 It is written in Saamana that PM Modi does not miss a single opportunity to comment on Pandit Nehru, but now he is trying to solve the problem like him
 bataa den ki piem modi do divasiy anaupchaarik daure par china gaye the
 There he held four rounds of talks with President Xi Jinping
 haalanki, is dauraan koi aadhikarik baat nahin hui
 But it was told by the Ministry of External Affairs that talks between PM Modi and Xi Jinping to fight terrorism and solve the border problem

 Gandhi also said that criminal action should be initiated against Modi to compromise national security

 In lieu of Jaswant Singh, the candidate with whom the BJP is thinking of Barmer Fatah, the same Colonel Sonaram has reverence for doda-poppy or opium to win the election
 party kii ek meeting main chunavi ranneeti banane jute kaaryakartaaon kii sabha main sonaaram ne vasundhara raaje se opium kii maang kar di
 In West Rajasthan, the case of poppy drink seeking votes is common
 shaayad yahi vajah thi ki sonaaram kii maang par vasundhara ne naa to fatkaar lagaai naa hi koi chetavanee di
 That is, Vasundhara Raje also supported the demand for opium
 haalanki 10 saal pehle vasundhara raaje ke hi shasankaal main jab jaswant singh ne apane ghar par riyaan yani opium panchayat baithai thi, to siem sahiba ne narcotics vibhaag main mukadmaa darj kara diya tha
 In fact, in western Rajasthan, Riyaan or opium panchayats decide who will vote
 samaaj ke bade-bujurg jab vot tay karne ke liye ek saath baithte hai to us vakt opium gholkar pilaayaa jaataa he or jab ek baar kisi party kii taraf se opium pi lee gai, to phir vot bhi usee ko dena padataa he
 Every person involved in Riyana drinks a drink of that poppy
 chanaav main gaanv-gaanv main riyaan chalata he
 Also known as opium panchayat
 isi rivaaj kaa hawala dete hue bijepi ke barmer ummidavaar ne doda-post kii maang kii, jisapar jamkar taaliyaan bhi baji
 The Congress is in a mood to take action against Sonaram under the guise of this act of Sonaram joining Congress and leaving BJP
 congress kii pravaktaa archana sharma kaa kahana he ki party is bare main shikaayat karengi
 He said, 'it is highly condemnable that in the presence of Vasundhara, the aspirants are demanding and promoting drugs, this reflects the double character of the BJP'

 co / 2am3woii3z— The White House (@whitehouse)january 11, 2017 In the Swat Valley, the Taliban have destroyed women
 pehle ladakiyon kaa skool janaa band karavaaya
 Then the women were banned from leaving the house and now they have issued a decree that women cannot make their identity cards
 kyonki taliban kii najar main ye islam ke khilaaf he
 This order has been issued in Swat valley by tehreek-e-taliban commander Omar Farooq
 swat ghati main sarkari mulajimon ko hukum diya gaya he ki wo mahilaon ko ai card jari nahin karen
 The Taliban have threatened that if a government employee ignores his decree, he will be put to death
 taliban ko mahilaon kii aazaadee pasand nahin
 The Taliban do not like women roaming outside
 taliban ko ladakiyon kaa skool janaa pasand nahin or ab usne kaha he ki use mahilaon ko ai card diya janaa pasand nahin kyonki ai card par mahilaon kii tasviir lagi hoti he, jo ki islam ke khilaaf he
 The work of distributing identity cards to women in the Swat Valley was started by the National Database Registration Authority of Pakistan, but now it will have to stop after the Taliban orders
 swat ghati main taliban kaa na sirf hukumat chalata he balki uskaa apana alag kanoon bhi he jo wo khud banaata he
 Whatever is happening with women in Swat today reminds us of Afghanistan because the Taliban destroyed the lives of women there too

 Imran has been saying that he is not advocating for drinking alcohol

 He argues that if in this country the age of marriage is 21 years and the age of voting is 18 years, which is both very responsible work, then why is the age of drinking 25 years? madhyapradesh ke shadol main jile ke prabharee mantri onkaar singh markaam ke saamne congress kaaryakarta aapas main bhid gayi

 The teacher community has welcomed Sibal's statement
 ek sammelan main sibbal ne kaha ki jabatak shikshakon ko uchit laabh nahin milegaa, tabatak acchhee pratibhaaen is kshetra kii ore aakarshith nahin hongi
 He said, "there is no equality in salaries of teachers
 unhen koi chikitsa laabh, awaas bhatta yaa anya suvidhaayen va pension nahin miltaa he
 "according to him," parents also encourage their children to work in a job that earns them more money
 jabatak ham yah na maan len ki bacchon ko shikshit kar maanviya puunji nirmaan karnaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn he, ham kuch nahin kar sakate
 " sibbal ke is bayaan kaa shikshakon ne swaagat kiya he
 Madhulika Sen, Principal of Tagore International School in Delhi said, “I completely agree with the Union Minister
 shikshakon ko kam vetan miltaa he, isliye unhen anya vikalpon kii talash kerani padati he
 " springdel public skool ke pradhanacharya jyoti bose ne haalanki, kaha ki shikshakon kaa vetan badha he lekin yah korporate duniya kaa tadak-bhadak he jo pratibha ko hamase dur le jaataa he

 In a conference, Sibal said that unless the teachers get proper benefits, good talent will not be attracted towards this field
 unhone kaha, "shikshakon ke vetan main samanta nahin he
 They do not get any medical benefits, housing allowance or other facilities and pension
 " unke anusaar, "abhibhavak bhi apane bacchon ko aisi naukari ke liye protsaahit karte hai, jisase unhen adhik paise mili
 We cannot do anything unless we believe that creating human capital by educating children is of paramount importance
 " This statement of Sibal has been welcomed by the teachers
 dilli ke tagore international skool kii pradhanacharya madhulika sen ne kaha, "main kendriya mantri se puri tarah sahamat hum
 Teachers get low salaries, so they have to look for other options
 " However, Jyoti Bose, Principal of Springdale Public School, said that the salary of teachers has increased but it is the temper of the corporate world that takes talent away from us
 tippaniyan Nirmal Sonkar, who has been serving in a government school for the past 20 years, said that the Union Minister should insist on increasing the number of teachers
 sibbal ne yah bhi kaha ki ek aisi vyastha banane kii jarurat he, jisase shikshakon ko apane kshetra ke bare main jaankaree adhyatan karne main madad mil sake
 He said that the National Mission is being launched in the 12th Five Year Plan to train teachers, which aims to improve the quality of teachers

 Indicating the bjp's plan, party president Amit Shah on May 4 termed the upcoming assembly elections a battle between those representing farmers versus corporate houses and Maharajas
 saaf taur par yah congress ke nae pradesh adhyaksh kamalnath or chunaav prachaar samiti ke nav niyukt prabharee jyotiraditya sindhiya par nishaanaa tha
 Shah's two-hour visit in Bhopal caused a stir as he took time out from the busy election campaigning in Karnataka to visit the state to address the 'extended' meeting of the state BJP executive
 is baithak main pradesh ke block str ke kaaryakartaaon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 a day before this, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan had created suspense at an event of Anand department by hinting that he was probably ready to step out of the fray
 lekin baad main pataa chalaa ki shah vahaan sirf pradesh ke nae party adhyaksh rakesh singh ke prati samarthan jaahir karne aae the
 The BJP president also went there to formulate an electoral strategy, as Rahul Gandhi unexpectedly appointed Kamal Nath as the state president of the Congress
 isse pehle chunaav ko chaihaan or sindhiya ke bich muqabla maanate hue bhaajapa 'kisaan putr banaam maharaja' kaa mudda banane kii muhim chalaane ja rahi thi
 But after Kamal Nath was made the president, Shah cleverly attacked the Congress, alleging that she wanted to work for corporate interests
 iskaa jawaab dete hue kamalnath ne kisaanon kii hitaishi hone ke bhaajapa ke daavon par hi sawaal khadaa kar diya
 He said, "A large number of farmers have committed suicide in the state
" 
 
 or jab ve virodh karte hai to police kii goli se maar die jate hai
 "shah is focusing on creating a worker-centric campaign to reduce the anti-incumbency
" unhone kaaryakartaaon se mukhyamantri or pradhanmantri ke kaamon kaa prachaar karne par jor dete hue kaha, ''chunaav party sanghathan ke kaam ke aadhaar par jeeta jayega
 "contrary to the uncertainty in Karnataka, Shah is more confident in Madhya Pradesh, where, according to her, activists will only have to work to increase the margin of victory
" pradesh main 65 lakh sakriy sadasyon (party ke mutabik) vaali party kii sanghathanaatmak takat par kisi ko shaq nahin he
 To fight this, the Congress will have to fight hard
 bhaajapa chaahati he ki chunavi ladaai ko kisaan putr banaam maharaja kii jang main badal diya jaae
 *** ab airport par chaahe netaa aae yaa commershili importeint person yaa phir bijness class main safar karne vaala yatri, ab kisi kii bhivishesh aavbhagat nahin hogi

 The party gave him a ticket from Deoria seat
 ve saansad ban gaye or isi vajah se yah seat khaali ho gai thi

 Mishra says, 'this seat has been BJP only
 pehle bhi yah party ke paas thi or aage bhi upachunaav main party kaa ummidavaar hi yahaan se vijayi hoga
 i believe so

 Even at that time Lalji Tandon had put his full thrust, but infighting came in and he could not succeed in winning the son
 bijepi is seat ko kisi bhi haalat main apane haath se jane dena nahin chaahati he, isliye calraj mishra ke saath hi kai saansadon ko bhi lagaaya gaya he, jo tandon ke bete ko jitaane ke liye prachaar kar rahe hai
 Basti MP Harish Dwivedi, Rajya Sabha MP Kusum Rai as well as mps from nearby Lok Sabha seats are also campaigning

 agar is baar bijepi ne pidipi ko todane kii koshish kii or kashmir ke logon ke haq par daaka daalaa gaya to halaat usase bhi zyada kharaab honge
 Reacting to the matter, Jammu and Kashmir BJP president Ravindra Raina said the Kimhubba Muftika statement is very objectionable

 He said that we want to take the state towards peace, good governance and development

 'he said,' The Chowkidar of Hindustan does not have Rs 6000 crore for the farmers of Chhattisgarh, but Rs 30,000 crore for Anil Ambani
 mehul chokasee paisa lekar bhaag saktaa he, lekin kisaanon ke liye centre sarkaar ke paas nahin he
 'rahul Gandhi said,' What is the reason that the farmer gives his money to the insurance company and he does not get his money when the hail falls
 puraa phayda anil ambani kii company ko jaataa he
 As the Congress Party guaranteed 100 days of employment in MGNREGA, the right to information opened the doors of bureaucracy, guaranteed the right to food; Similarly, minimum income will be guaranteed
 'congress party ne ek aitihaasik nirnay liya he ki 2019 chunaav jeetne ke ekadam baad congress party guarantee karke nunatam aamadani dene ja rahi he : congress adhyaksh@rahulgandhi # congressforminimumincomeguaranteepic

 This is our vision & our promise
 — Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi)january 28, 2019rahul gandhi ke is elaan ke fouran baad congress netaaon ne bhi khushi jataai

 As soon as the Congress government is formed at the Center in 2019, every poor bank account will have "minimum income"

 The results of the by-elections in 4 Lok Sabha seats and 10 assembly seats of the country came on Thursday
 14 siton main endie or mahagathbandhan ke bich upachunaav kaa scorcard 3-11 kaa rahaa
 These results are going to have far-reaching ramifications for political parties heading towards the 2019 general elections
 padhein, in nateezon ke 10 bade sandesh:1
 While the results of the by-elections are being considered a major setback for the BJP, the success stories of the use of the opposition grand alliance were also going to be narrated
 khaskar upi main sapa-basapa ke bold siyaasi faisle ne saaf kar diya ki bijepi ke chanakya amit shah ke liye 2019 kii jang upi main 2014 jitani aasaan nahin rahane vaali
 2
 is jeet kaa shrey diya janaa chahie sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or basapa pramukh mayawati ko
 Before their common strategy, by defeating the BJP in gorakhpur-phulpur and now kairana-nurpur, all parties gave the infallible formula to beat the Modi magic
 3
 Now the opposition of Modi magic is with the opposition parties and that is the formula of grand alliance
 jo pehle bihar main safal rahi thi or ab upi main har upachunaav main kaamyaab hoti ja rahi he

 FINAL RESULT4 of by-elections for 4 Lok Sabha, 10 Assembly seats
 mamata banerjee kaa van-tu-van formula vipaksh ke liye brahmastra he
 That is, if the political equations of the BJP have to be defeated, then all parties, big and small, will have to come together
 isamen siyaasi ahm rukaawat nahin banani chahie
 Where one can win one has to win and support
 jaise gorakhpur-phulpur main basapa ne sapa ko mauka diya
 The RLD in Kairana and the SP in Nurpur were supported by all opposition parties and a 100 per cent victory was possible
 5
 Also, the electoral battle for BJP is not as easy as 2014
 centre main bijepi kii sarkaar ke 4 saal puure ho chuke hai or rojgaar-kisaanon ke muddon samet tamaam muddon par anti-inkambency kaa saamana ab bijepi ko karnaa hoga
 Now, just brand Modi is not enough to win
 6
 The Modi government at the center will have to take concrete steps that will make an impact among the public
 kisaanon, yuvaaon ke rojgaar ke mudde, aarthik gadabadiyon ko roak paane main vifaltaa aadi aise tamaam mudde hai jo vipaksh ko sarkaar ko gherne kaa mauka de rahe hai inpe thos kadam uthaane honge
 Apart from this, no concrete initiative on the core issues of BJP like Ram Mandir is making it difficult for BJP
 7
 Not only the Modi government at the center, but also the state governments of the BJP will have to demonstrate
 abhi desh ke 20 se adhik rajyon main bijepi or sahyogi dalon kii sarkarein hai
 Elections are to be held in important states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in the coming time
 jabaki desh ke sabase bade rajya upi jahaan prachand bahumat ke saath bijepi jitkar ai thi vahaan lagaataar upachunaavon main haar hui he
 The party will have to seriously consider the ground reality of the functioning of the government
 8
 The issue of inflation is becoming a major headache for the BJP
 petrol-dijal keemton ko lekar khud bijepi kii sahyogi dal jediu ne sawaal khadaa kiya or chunavi haar ke liye ise jimmedaar tehraaya
 9
 haalanki, upi-bihar jaise rajyon main badhati chunautiyon ke bich bijepi ke liye kuch achche sanket bhi hai
 As the bjp's penetration in West Bengal continues to grow
 tripura jaise purvottar rajya main jeet se nae ilaakon main party ke liye sambhaavnaaen badi hai
 In states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, the BJP has been active and it can benefit from it
 10
 It will also be a big challenge for the BJP to take allies together
 jediu, shivasena, upi main opi rajbhar kii party asantusht hai to tidipi ne endie se naata hi tod liya he
 In Assam, the Assam Gana Parishad is seen standing in protest
 vahiin duusari ore congress or mahagathbandhan ke kheme main lagaataar dalon kii taadaad badhati ja rahi he
 All these developments will make the 2019 elections interesting
