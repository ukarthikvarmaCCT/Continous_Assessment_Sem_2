 Since demonetisation, there is no dearth of creditors for the idea of a cashless economy
 kai naam saamne aae, unka intervyuu chapa, kai saansad ne khud ko mobile wolet kaa prachaarak bana liya
 But do you know whose idea is the mobile banking mobile wallet? Titlagarh is a town in Bolangir district of Odisha
 yaheen ke sam pitroda ne 1994 main america main digital wolet ke patent ke liye aavedan kiya tha
 Pitroda's digital wallet got a patent in 1996
 20-20 saal pehle kii bhartiya raajnneeti baiylgaadee par baithkar computer kaa virodh kar rahi thi, aaj bhi vaisaa hi kuch ghamaasan he, magar digital wolet kaa asli nayak gaayab he
 Advertisements of many types of mobile wallet companies are being published everyday, their advertisements are full of patriotism, but is it not strange that the name of an Indian who imagined it was missing in the same slogans whose adverts were painted with patriotism
 kya un companiyon ko nahin pataa ki digital wolet kii kalpana sam pitroda ne kii thi
 Politics and markets cleverly use patriotism and nationalism

 We were not even aware of this, but the information written in Hindi by former banker Vibhas Shrivastava was received

 Sam Mark's idea is from our colleague Amitesh
 reserve bank ke aadesh ke anusaar har bank ke branch main yah likhaa hona chahie ki uskaa aantarik lokapal koun he, sampark kaise hoga
 This Lokpal becomes a person retired from other banks
 bainko kaa apana lokapal to hota hi he, sabhi bainkon kaa bhi ek swatantra lokapal hota he
 Banks also have e-wallets and also companies
 bainkon ke wolet to lokapal ke daayre main aate hai, lekin companiyon ke i-wolet lokapal ke daayre main nahin aate
 If this is correct then why is this so
 notebandi ne darshak or patrkaar donon ko baking pranali ko samajhane kaa avasar uplabdh karaayaa he
 i may have missed reading and understanding, sorry for that already
 phir bhi jo samaj sakaa hum wo saajha karne kaa jokhim uthaa rahaa hum
 According to the Reserve Bank, you paid someone with an e-wallet
 jise pement kiya he uske khate main teen din ke andar paisa chalaa janaa chahie
 Suppose the money did not go away and was removed from your account
 to isaki shikaayat ke liye swatantra vyavastha kya he
 Suppose you have withdrawn money from the account and got stuck somewhere along the way
 zaahir he isaki shikaayat aapako wolet company se hi karenge
 If within three days the company did not give the money, after four days, or after a week it was found that the payment you had made was not received by the electrician, then what will you do
 rigerv bank wolet compinyon ko anumati detaa he ki ve apni nunatam jamaa raashi par wo byaaz kama sakati hai
 It is possible that a company earns interest by withholding your money and you have to pay penalty due to non-payment on time

 The Secretary of the Ministry of Information Technology of every state is an Adjudicating Officer
 agar aap sidhe hoicourt bhi gaye to vahaan se maamla tribunel main hi bheja jaataa he
 In Monday's 'prime Time', Prashant Mali said that in many states the responsibility of Adjudicating Officer has not been notified to the Principal Secretaries
 ham apni taraf se isaki pushti nahin kar sake
 If this is true, then the system of justice on cyber crime is quite dark

 According to the National Crime Branch, in 2013, 4,356 cases of cybercrime and 7,021 cases were registered in 2014
 somvaar ko ek report ai he ki cashles abhiyaan ke kaaran frod ke maamle 60-65 fisadi bad sakate hai
 According to the Computer Emergency Response Team cert-in 2015, the number of all types of cyber crimes was 49,455

 kya ham ek upabhokta ke taur par apane adhikaron ko lekar sajag hai
 Suppose someone hacked and blew a million from your account
 jivan bhar kii puunji saaf ho gai, to aap kahaan shikaayat karenge, aapke paas kya kanoonee adhikaar hai
 Politics and markets cleverly use patriotism and nationalism
 isliye ek minute thahar kar sochane main koi harj nahin he
 We were not even aware of this, but the information written in Hindi by former banker Vibhas Shrivastava was received
 2010 main sam pitroda or mehul desai ne ek kitaab bhi likhi
 The name of the book is 'the March of Mobile Money'
 is kitaab main mobile baking kii yatra or bhavishya ke bare main varnan he
 Another book by Mehul Desai is The Quest for Cashless Society which was also published in 2015
 hamane sam pitroda se sampark kaa prayaas kiya lekin safal nahin ho sake
 Pitroda said in 2010 that in 30 years, paper money or notes will disappear
 agar ye baat aksharsh: sahi he to notebandi ke in pachaas dinon main se koi ek din sam pitroda diwas ke rup main manaaya ja saktaa he yaa phir gahanon par lagane vaale haul mark kii tarah i-wolet ke liye sam mark shuru ho saktaa he
 Sam Mark's idea is from our colleague Amitesh
 reserve bank ke aadesh ke anusaar har bank ke branch main yah likhaa hona chahie ki uskaa aantarik lokapal koun he, sampark kaise hoga
 This Lokpal becomes a person retired from other banks
 bainko kaa apana lokapal to hota hi he, sabhi bainkon kaa bhi ek swatantra lokapal hota he
 Banks also have e-wallets and also companies
 bainkon ke wolet to lokapal ke daayre main aate hai, lekin companiyon ke i-wolet lokapal ke daayre main nahin aate
 If this is correct then why is this so
 notebandi ne darshak or patrkaar donon ko baking pranali ko samajhane kaa avasar uplabdh karaayaa he
 i may have missed reading and understanding, sorry for that already
 phir bhi jo samaj sakaa hum wo saajha karne kaa jokhim uthaa rahaa hum
 According to the Reserve Bank, you paid someone with an e-wallet
 jise pement kiya he uske khate main teen din ke andar paisa chalaa janaa chahie
 Suppose the money did not go away and was removed from your account
 to isaki shikaayat ke liye swatantra vyavastha kya he
 Suppose you have withdrawn money from the account and got stuck somewhere along the way
 zaahir he isaki shikaayat aapako wolet company se hi karenge
 If within three days the company did not give the money, after four days, or after a week it was found that the payment you had made was not received by the electrician, then what will you do
 rigerv bank wolet compinyon ko anumati detaa he ki ve apni nunatam jamaa raashi par wo byaaz kama sakati hai
 It is possible that a company earns interest by withholding your money and you have to pay penalty due to non-payment on time
 kya ham tamaam kanoonon or apane adhikaron kii baarikiyon ko samajhate hai
 In Monday's 'prime Time', lawyer Prashant Mali said that there has been no judge in Delhi's Cyber appellate Tribunal since 2012
 yah sunakar ham chaunk gaye
 Our colleague Sharad Sharma reached the office of the Cyber appellate Tribunal in Delhi on Tuesday morning
 bharat main sibar aparaadh ke liye yah iklauti court he
 Just like there is a National Green Tribunal for Environment, but the NGT or other tribunal has a chairman and two members
 engiti main agar chairman nahin he to member nyaayik prakriya ko badha saktaa he
 Due to the absence of any such provision in the IT Act 2000, the date is found in the cyber tribunal for the last five and a half years, the decision does not come
 kyonki iske member jaj kaa kaam nahin kar sakate hai
 Although these judges are not called presiding officers, but a retired judge sits on its chair
 justise rajesh tandon is tribunel ke aakhri jaj the
 There have been no judges since June 30, 2011
 sharad sharma ne tribunel kii website bhi dekhi jisase pataa chalata he ki 2011 se yahaan par koi jajment hi nahin aayaa he
 Its office is on the ground floor of Jeevan Bharati Building, Connaught Place
 ham isaki pushti to nahin kar sakate lekin aisa sunne ko mila ki is daftar kaa kiraaya maheene kaa 30-35 lakh rupaya he
 No expenditure on rent and judge for five and a half years for decision
 ye kiski javabdehi he
 However, this tribunal comes under the IT ministry of Ravi Shankar Prasad
 mantralay ne yahaan paryaapt staff bhi nahin diye hai
 It is written on its website that the appointment of the chairman is under consideration with the government
 sibar krime kii hindustan kii iklauti adaalat kaa ye haal he
 Cyber lawyer Pawan Duggal ji said that the absence of a judge is in some way a violation of human rights

 If this is true, then one of these fifty days of demonetisation can be celebrated as Sam Pitroda Day or Sam Mark can be started for e-wallet, like hall mark on jewelry
 sam mark kaa idia hamaare sahyogi amitesh kaa he
 According to the order of the Reserve Bank, it should be written in the branch of every bank, who is its internal ombudsman, how will the contact be done
 yah lokapal duusare bainkon se ritred hua vyakti banataa he
 Banks have their own ombudsman, all banks also have an independent ombudsman
 bainkon ke bhi i wolet hote hai or companiyon ke bhi
 Wallets of banks come under the purview of Lokpal, but e-wallets of companies do not come under the purview of Lokpal
 agar yah sahi he to aisa kyon he
 Demonetisation has provided an opportunity for both the viewer and the journalist to understand the banking system
 mere padhane or samajhane main chook ho sakati he, iske liye pehle hi maafee
 Still i am taking the risk of sharing what i understand
 rigerv bank ke anusaar i-wolet se aapane kisi ko bhugtan kiya
 Money should be deposited in the account of the person who has paid within three days
 maan lijie ki paisa nahin gaya or aapke khate se nikal gaya
 So what is the independent mechanism for its complaint
 maan lijie ki aapane khate se paisa nikal gaya or raste main kahin atak gaya
 It is obvious that you will complain to the wallet company itself
 agar teen din ke andar company ne paisa nahin diya, chaar din baad diya yaa haftaa bhar pataa chalaa ki aapane jo pement kiya tha wo bijli vaale ko mila hi nahin to aap kya karenge
 The Reserve Bank allows wallet companies to earn the interest on their minimum deposits
 ho saktaa he ki koi company aapkaa paisa roak kar byaaz kama le or udhar samay par pement na karne ke kaaran aapako jurmaana bharna pad jaae
 Do we understand the nuances of all laws and our rights

 The Supreme Court has asked the Central Government to file a report of the Parliament Standing Committee on the appointment of Lokpal
 court jaananaa chahta he ki aakhir ve koun se sanshodhan hai, jo lokapal bill main kiye jane hai
 The next hearing of the case will be held on 14 December
 lokapal kii niyukti main ho rahi deree ko lekar daakhil yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kaha ki agar yah samasya dur nahin ho paa rahi he to court aadesh de saktaa he ki act main LOP kaa matlab sansad main sabase badi vipakshi party kaa netaa hi netaa vipaksh hoga, vahiin atorni general mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki is maamle main or bhi kai mudde hai, jin par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Significantly, in the last hearing, the Supreme Court had questioned the Central Government that the Lokpal Act was made in 2014, so why this process has not been completed till now, and why the appointment of Lokpal was not done
 
 
 ? supreme court ne kaha tha ki court lokapal kii niyukti main is tarah deree hote nahin dekh saktaa
 Lokpal should not be allowed to become a dead letter
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court had remarked that the government is showing interest in bringing honesty, but why the Lokpal is not bringing amendments to the bill
 
 
 ? supreme court ne kaha tha ki centre sarkaar ko iske liye koi dedline tay kerani hogi, or agar yah kaam centre nahin karata, to supreme court apane adhikaar kaa istemaal kar sabase badi party ke netaa ko netaa vipaksh hone kaa aadesh jari kar degaa
 In this case, the central government said that the Lokpal Act has to be amended, and the bill for this is pending in Parliament
 act ke mutabik search cameti main netaa vipaksh ko hona chahie, lekin abhi koi netaa vipaksh nahin he, isliye sabase badi party ke netaa ko cameti main shaamil karne ke liye act main sanshodhan karnaa hoga, or yah sansad main lambit he
 During the hearing on the petition filed for the delay in the appointment of Lokpal, the Supreme Court said that if this problem is not resolved, the court can order that the LOP in the Act means only the leader of the largest opposition party in Parliament Leader will be the opposition, while Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said that there are many other issues in this case which are being considered
 gauratlab he ki pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne centre sarkaar se sawaal kiya tha ki lokapal act 2014 main bana tha, to ab tak yah prakriya puri kyon nahin hui, or lokapal kii niyukti kyon nahin hui
 
 
 The The Supreme Court had said that the court cannot see such delay in appointment of Lokpal
 lokapal ko ek ded letters nahin banane diya janaa chahie
 The comments supreme court ne tippanee kii thi ki sarkaar eemaandaaree laane ke liye apni ruchi dikhaati hue dikh rahi he, lekin lokapal bill main sanshodhan kyon nahin laa rahi he
 
 
 The The Supreme Court had said that the Central Government would have to fix a deadline for this, and if this work does not take place by the Center, the Supreme Court will use its authority to issue an order to the leader of the largest party to be the leader of the opposition
 vahiin is maamle main centre sarkaar ne kaha ki lokapal act main sanshodhan karnaa he, or iske liye bill sansad main lambit he
 According to the Act, there should be a Leader of Opposition in the search committee, but as of now there is no Leader of the Opposition, so the Leader of the largest party will have to amend the Act to be included in the Committee, and it is pending in Parliament

 saath hi saaf kiya ki rajya main chunaav jeetne ke baad hi mukhyamantri ke naam kaa elaan kiya jayega
 On a day's visit, Raheel Gandhi participated in several events in Raipur where he discussed in a closed room with journalists
 is charchaa main unhone kai aise maamalon se patrakaron ko rou-ba-rou karaayaa jo aane vaale dinon main congress kii ranneeti kaa hissaa ban sakate he
 Although this discussion was informal
 rahul gandhi ne saaf kiya ki chhattisgarh mencongresski yojana naa to kisi ko mukhyamantri project karne kii he or naa hi unke samaksh party netaaon kii koi ranking he
 For example, no number leader in the party is number one, two, three but BJP is the number one enemy
 unhone kaha ki chunaav ke pehle wo kisi ko bhi mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa nahin maan rahe he
 There will be a decision in this matter only after winning the election
 is dauraan rahul gandhi se jab ye poocha gaya ki unhone punjab vidhansabha chunaav ke purv main amarinder singh ko mukhyamantri ghoshit kiya tha to chhattisgarh main kyon nahin
 On this, Rahul accepted that there could be differences here and the party may have to bear the brunt of this
 ajit jogi kii no entriajeet jogi kii vaapasi par rahul gandhi ne saaf kiya ki ab purv mukhyamantri jogi kicongresamen phir se vaapasi kii koi sambhaavna nahin he or na hi jogi kii party ke saath kisi bhi tarah kaa koi gathbandhan hoga
 He further said that any party has an alliance with its power
 is lihaaj se chhattisgarh or madhyapradesh main bispi ke saath gathbandhan or siton ke bantwaare par charchaa chal rahi he
 He told that a separate alliance of Congress is being formed in Uttar Pradesh
 isamen espi or bispi samet kuch chote dal shaamil hai
 This alliance will be different from the Grand Alliance
 is gathbandhan ke jariye uttar pradesh, bihar or madhya pradesh jaise bade rajyon se bijepi kii sansadeey siton ke safaaye kii yojana he
 To be announced by September, Rahul Gandhi had earlier announced about ticket distribution in Chhattisgarh that before August 15, he will announce his candidates in more than half the seats, but today he made it clear that now by announcing all the candidates by the end of September
 will be given
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki aadhe ummidavaar tay ho chuke he baaki prakriya main hai
 On the Rafale deal, Rahul once again attacked the central government and attacked the BJP sharply, saying that it is not untouched by corruption
 jis hawaii jahaaj kaa maatr 540 karod main upie sarkaar ne sauda kiya tha use piem modi 1,600 karod main kharid rahe hai
 That too without canceling the old deal
 rahul gandhi se jab poocha gaya ki wo endie sarkaar se chaar saal kaa hisaab maang rahe he
 On the other hand, the BJP has been asking them for a book of sixty years, on which the Congress president was silent for a while
 phir unhone modi or amit shah ko kosa
 Rahul Gandhi, avoiding the old issues and matters and talking about discussing new issues, postponed many such prickly questions
 rahul gandhi congress ke nae mukhyalay rajeev bhawan kaa locarpan karne raipur aae the, lekin dilli ravaanaa hone se pehle unhone patrakaron ke alaava vyapaariyon, udyogpatiyon or doctoron ke pratinidhimandal se bhi charchaa kii
 Also met local party leaders
 bajet 2012-13 kaa bhagya dilli kii jagah lakhanu main tay hua
 In the afternoon of March 6, when it became clear that the Samajwadi Party (SP) would not need the support of the Congress to form a government in Uttar Pradesh, the economic needs in the Finance Ministry in North Block came to dominate political realities
 
 vitt mantralay ke ek adhikari bataate hai, ‘pranab mukherjee ko usee din se pataa tha ki ek saahasik, sudhaarwadi bajet paarit karaane ke liye congress ke paas jaruri sankhya nahin hogi
 The Finance Minister is an observant and conservative person
 unhone sahmati ban jane tak intjaar karne kaa faisla kiya
 'it can be impossible to reach consensus in a badly divided politics
 vyaavhaarik rup main vitt mantralay ke bade adhikari bas yahi ummid kar rahe hai ki upie sarkaar agle do maheenon main mulaayam singh yadav kii sapa kaa majboot samarthan paa legi
 "there was not much time between March 6 and March 16 for any agreement with the SP on major reforms," says an official
 ’sambhaavna yah dekhi ja rahi he ki upie main sapa ke 23 saansad mamata banerjee ke 19 saansadon kii bharpai kar denge
 After all, Mamta Banerjee will not support any reformist law in any case
 abhi tak sapa ne upie ko mili-jule sanket hi die hai
 It has rescued the government at the disputed National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC)
 lekin mulaayam ne ‘chunaav ke itane kareeb’ upie sarkaar main shaamil hone kii sambhaavna ko nakaar diya he
 The word 'closer' probably refers to closer time than the remaining two years with the UPA
 congress shaayad bina kisi baadha ke jis sudhaar par amal kar sakati thi, vah he sarkari kharchon or khaskar sabsidi ko taarkik bananaa
 The UPA government has been spending more than its resources, just as the Congress governments of the 1980s did
 desh 1991 main lagbhag diwalia ho gaya tha
 Even at this time, if there is no crisis then there is definitely a difficult situation
 16 march ko pesh bajet ke mutabik, vittiya ghaataa (phiscal dephisit) 2011-12 main jidipi ke 5
 9 percent, while the budget is estimated at 4 in 2011
 8 pratishat kaa tha
 Government deficit shows how much the government is spending compared to its income
 oonche sarkari ghate kaa matlab yah he ki sarkaar arthvyavastha main uplabdh sansadhano kaa bada hissaa hathiyaa kar adhik sakasham nijee kshetra ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahi he
 This is bad for economic development
 is ghate kaa lagbhag ek-tihaai bhaag (jidipi kaa lagbhag do pratishat) bhojan, khaad or eendhan kii sabsidi main chalaa jaataa he
 The Finance Ministry believes that this budget has taken a lot of steps to indicate reliable reforms on spending and subsidies
 iske ek adhikari kehete hai, ‘hamane 2012-13 main sarkari ghate ko 5
 Has promised to bring it down at 1 percent
 vitt mantri ne sabsidi par jidipi ke do pratishat kii adhiktam seemaa lagane kii saahasik ghoshnaa kii he
 'now the level of subsidy 2 of GDP
 2 pratishat par he
 Not everyone believes that government estimates on spending and subsidies are reliable
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne 16 march ko india today conklev main kaha, ‘main aashwast nahin hum ki do pratishat kii seemaa ek vyaavhaarik kadam he
 Last year, the government 1
 43 lakh karod ru
 Had announced subsidy of Rs
 lekin vaastavik kharch 2
 16 lakh crore Rs
 kaa hua
 This amounted to a total of Rs 70,000 crore from the amount fixed in the budget
 zyada he
 Jaitley has a point
 jab sarkaar pichley saal hi sabsidi ke apane tay lakshya se 50 pratishat aage chali gai ho to aane vaale vitt varsh main do pratishat kii seemaa mahaj chhadam aavaran or aankadon kaa shadjaal lagata he, yah koi vaastavik sudhaar nahin
 The arithmetic of the government's deficit rests on a number of assumptions and all of them are not sure
 aamadani ke bare main isane mana he ki radd hone vaale 2ji licenson kii nilaamee se 40,000 karod ru
 Will meet
 tamaam telecom companiyon kii vittiya haalat dekhte hue itani rakam shaayad na mili
 30,000 crore in 2012-13 from PSU disinvestment by the government
 paane kaa anumaan rakhaa he
 If take any cue from ongc's recent pitched disinvestment, totaling Rs 13,000 crore
 ke sheyaron kii bikri main se 11,000 karod ru
 If LIC gave it, then Rs 30,000 crore from disinvestment
 paane kaa lakshya mahatvakankshi lagata he
 Government estimates on the expenditure front will be correct only if the oil subsidy budget is fixed at Rs 40,000 crore
 se aage na jaae
 The government's previous record does not arouse confidence
 isane 2011-12 main tel sabsidi ke naam par bajet main keval 20,000 karod ru
 60,000 crore, but the actual expenditure was Rs
 kaa ho gaya
 An official says, 'if the international price of oil is $ 115 (rs 5,750
 ) prati bairal se zyada ho jaae, to sarkaar kaa yah ganit bighad saktaa he
 In an informal conversation, Finance Ministry officials believe that the oil subsidy figures will be correct only if the government removes the diesel price control
 aisa karne ke liye use sapa ke samarthan kii jarurat hogi
 Farmers use diesel a lot, which is the main support base of the SP
 aise main puri tarah niyantran hataanaa mumkin nahin lagata
 The target of government deficit can be easily shattered, along with subsidy limits
 videshi nivesh aarthik sudhaaron kaa mahatvapurn kshetra he
 The government merely spent a lot on this matter
 vitt mantri ne multi-brands retail main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadi) ko mahaj ek para main samet diya
 The deadlock created in 2011 has not been taken any further
 vimaan sevaaon main epadi kaa zikr mahaj ek vaakya main hua
 It was said to be discussed while it could be declared as a policy
 multibrands retail main epadi ke ulat vimaan sevaaon main epadiai koi bhaavnaatmak rajnatik mudda nahin he
 Support can be raised on this
 vitt mantralay ke aalaa adhikari isi baat par santosh jataa rahe hai ki mantri ke bhaashan main epadi kaa zikr kar diya gaya he
 An official said, 'if we were not willing to take it forward, we could have removed it completely from the speech
 ’ baharhaal, vitt mantri ne apane bhaashan main epadi kaa paksh lene kii jo kamjor koshish kii, uskaa asar finance bill kii ek behad pratigaami dhara se mit gaya
 It amended the country's tax rules from the past, giving the government the power to levy tax in foreign transactions between two companies outside India, provided the assets involved in the deal are located in India
 bajet ke thik chaar din baad 20 march ko sarvocch nyaayalay ne 20 janvari ke apane faisle par phir se muhar laga di, jisamen isane vodaphone-hach saude par bharat main tex na lagane kaa aadesh diya tha
 It quashed the government's petition to review its decision
 lekin finance bill jab kanoon ban jayega, tab sambhawatah nyaayalay ko apana vichaar badalane ke liye majaboor hona padegaa
 When this amendment is passed, the government will pay Rs 11,000 crore on UK telecom company Vodafone
 ke capital gains tex kaa daawa kar sakegi, bhale hi vodaphone or hach donon hi is saude ke samay bharat se baahar ke companiyaan thim
 With this important amendment in the tax law, the government is willing to pay $ 54 crore (rs 2,700 crore) on some other cross-border deals
 ) kaa tex hasil kar sakegi
 The government's move has been widely criticized
 kansaltency form kavpiemji ke dipti sieo or tex practice prabhag ke chairman dinesh kanabar kehete hai, ‘jin sabhi saudon par tex lagaaya ja saktaa tha, ve sabhi pehle se adaalat ke saamne hai
 The government says that it is about Rs 30,000 crore from tax on all these deals
 juta sakegi
 How did the finance minister know this number? According to Dinesh, it is very likely that this amendment will be challenged in the court
 lekin isse pehle aise zyada maukey nahin aae he, jab adaalaton ne aise sanshodhano ko radd kiya ho
 Joint tax leader Ketan Dalal of pricewaterhousecoopers says, "the amendments implemented from the past create serious uncertainty in the minds of investors
 inase sarkaar kii saakh par bura asar hota he
 This will definitely have an impact on foreign direct investment
 ’ ve kehete hai, ‘hamaare videshi graahakon kaa bharosa buree tarah hill gaya he
 They are beginning to wonder what else this government will change suddenly
 ’aadhikarik rup se vitt mantralay is kadam kaa bachaav kar rahaa he
 Finance Secretary R
 es
 Gujral said in a discussion with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) after the budget, 'we are all Indians
 agar ek videshi company apana bhartiya kaarobaar kisi anya videshi company ko beche or kahe ki hamen koi tex nahin dena he, to mujhe nahin lagata ki yah sweekaar karne vaali cheez he
 We also want a clear position in tax related matters
 ’anaupchaarik rup se adhikari maanate hai ki chupake se yah sanshodhan karnaa acha nahin tha or kam-se-kam is sanshodhan ke shabdon ko behatar rakhaa ja saktaa tha
 "it should not have clearly mentioned the recent judicial verdict," said an official
 ’ aisa karnaa sarvocch nyaayalay ke saath sidhi muthbhed jaisaa laga
 a senior official says, "if this retrograde amendment to tax laws was not made in the budget, then there would have been a good response to this budget
 ’ niveshkon or upabhoktaaon ko ek susangat, vishwasaneey, bhavishya kii ore dekhne vaala sandesh dene main upie ko lagaataar mushkilen aa rahi hai
 By following backward-looking populist policies, the growth rate of the economy will remain well below its actual potential

 congress party ne bayaan jari kar kaha he ki shahzad poonawala pichhali cameti main the, is baar jo cameti bani usamen wo nahin hai
 Even, he did not even become a member of the Congress party this time
 aise main jo congress kaa sadsy tak nahin usko media gambhirtha se na le
 What did Shahzad Poonawala say? Amid preparations to hand over the command of Congress to Rahul Gandhi, a young Congress leader Shahzad Poonawalla had said that he wants to contest against Rahul Gandhi for the post of Congress President
 poonawala aksar tivi channelon par party kaa bachaav karte dikhte hai
 Shahzad had said that the election for the post of president in Congress is not being done and everything is fixed
 cameti is tarah se banaai gai he ki rahul gandhi ke naam par bas muhar lagaani he
 Who is Shahzad Poonawala? Maharashtra Congress secretary Shahzad Poonawala questioned the selection process of the president in the Congress and said that he would fight if there was a fair election
 shahzad poonawala ne twit kar vanshavaad ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya or kaha ki ek parivaar se kisi ek ko hi pad milanaa chahie, chaahe vah koi bhi ho

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki rahul gandhi 4 disambar ko namakan patr daakhil karenge, kyonki rahul 1 or 2 disambar ko kerala main rahenge
 It is believed that Rahul Gandhi will not have to face the election, he will be elected unopposed

 Death is the last truth of life
 ek aisa sach jise koi nahin jhuthla saktaa
 Crocodile will come
 kaise aegi
 What time will it come kahaan aegi
 Nobody knows this
 lekin kabhi-kabhi jis tarah se achaanak maut aa jaati he, us par yakeen hi nahin hota
 If you believe then how come? Somebody died while dancing
 to koi baat karte-karte mar gaya
 Somebody got so happy that suddenly the breath stopped
 to kisi ko aisa sadma mila ki dhadakanen ruk ho gayi
 This is not the only case
 aisi ghatnaayen pehle bhi saamne ai hai
 In dance competition, a 13-year-old innocent tied her dance in just 12 seconds at the Accum Competition in Mumbai
 magar 13wein second main bhagwaan ne uski saansen baandh deen
 She suddenly collapsed on stage and died
 darasal, mumbai ke kandivali pashchim ke lalji pada main pichley 23 november se 'CM chashak'kaarykramchal rahaa tha, isamen dance kaa kaarykram rakhaa gaya tha
 Meanwhile, 12-year-old Anisha Sharma was dancing on stage
 anisha ne jaise hi dance karnaa shuru kiya, kuch second main hi vah stage par gir gai
 When people went near and saw him, he was dead
 baraat main duulhe kii moutgujarat ke vadodara main bhi kuch maah pehle aisa hi maamla saamne aayaa tha
 a 25-year-old youth was getting married
 wo duulhaa banakar ghodi par savaar tha
 His friends were singing and dancing
 duulhaa apni shaadi main itnaa khush tha ki wo apane dost ke kandhe par chadhakar wo dil khol kar naachne laga
 But when she landed from the friend's shoulder, her eyes were turned
 maut use lekar ja chuki thi
 The story of Vishnu Chandra Dudhanath Pandey of Moutummumbai on the stage is also similar
 use uske kaam ke liye award mil rahaa tha
 The auditorium was buzzing with applause
 use manch par bulaayaa gaya
 He was moving towards the stage dancing and singing
 wo award lene ja rahaa tha ki achaanak wo vahiin gir padaa or zindagi use chhodkar chali gai
 The viewers were surprised
 shaadi main mautye maamla rajasthan kaa he
 There was a wedding ceremony in the famous city of Jodhpur
 maahaul khushgavaar tha
 Everybody was singing and dancing
 shahrukh kii mashhoor film 'dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge' kaa geet 'tuje dekha to ye janaa sanam' baj rahaa tha
 Vijay Dheldia was jogging on this song with his wife
 naach rahe the
 The song line is 'teri Arms Mein Marge Hum'
 
 
 ' wo bhi bahon main the
 
 
 And suddenly died in the arms
 kaarykram main thirakate hue mautkisi shahar main ek kaarykram chal rahaa tha
 The song was playing 'stars wrapped on body
 
 
 ' usee gane par ek bujurg danpati thirak rahe the
 The watchers were clapping
 lekin tabhi thirakate hue us buzurg shaks ko aisa dil kaa daura padaa ki naachte naachte hi unka badan thanda pad gaya
 Looking at his pictures, one realizes that death cannot be trusted
 kyonki wo kabhi bataa kar nahin aati
 This is death
 ye kisi se appointment nahin leti
 They all know that life and death are in the hands of the one above
 kab koun, kaise uthegaa ye koi nahin jaanata
 Death anywhere
 kabhi bhi

 Problem: Rahu, Ketu and Shani are seated on the line of 'love Stories' in the career of innocent and chalky boy Imran Khan and Mars is heavy from above
 logon ne to ab yahaan tak kahana shuru kar diya he kiimran ko agar expreshans dene nahin aate or dance karnaa nahin aata, to wo modelling main acha kariyar bana sakate the
 But now if you have entered the film industry, then why not do some new experiments? Kulfi of the same typical love story of every movie, Imran running like children behind the kulfi (girl) of that story's kulfi, and finally the three legs of the same Dhaka! In every film, Imran is madly behind the girl, and the girl does not give him emotion
 film relies hone ke baad pataa chalata he ki sari footage bhi heroin le gai
 Imran's career is like that
 kariyar main chance:1988 main 'qayaamat se qayaamat tak' or 1992 main 'jo jeeta vahi sikandar' main imran ne child artist ke role kiye
 He was also honored with the Filmfare Award for Best New Comer in 2008 after debuting with 'jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na'

 a few select hits like 'I Hate Love Stories', 'after Break', 'mere Brother Ki Dulhan' and 'delhi Bailey' also came up
 lekin adhiktar filmon main heroin hi sari footage kha gayi
 There was a time when every actress in movies, from Sonam Kapoor to Kareena Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, danced them like lattoos and set their careers
 ab sitambar 2015 main 'katti batti' main kanganaase bhi sab aisi hi ummid kar rahe hai
 No fan wants Imran's bad
 lekin wo aisi hi filmein kyon sin karte hai jinamein unhen samajhaayaa ja rahaa hota he ki, 'bhai, wo ladki tere liye sahi nahin he
 She is making a fool of you by just passing time with you
 ' imran ke or sage sambandhi yaa hitaishi log unhen ye baat kyon nahin samajhaate? kyon imran hameshaa aisi hi filmein sin karte hai jisamen unhen ladki ke peeche bhaagta dikhaaya gaya ho? unhen kamedi, ection vagairah se parhez kyon he? kya koi aisi film aegi jise imran apane dam par hit sabit karenge?kehane ko to imran ne los angelis sthit 'neuyork film academy' se film mekking kaa course bhi kiya

 He said that BJP leaders are making such comments because the Sangh's agenda is not being implemented in the southern state
 bijepi or sangh ke log baukhalaaye hue hai
 Vijayan later said in a Facebook post that BJP ministers and union leaders should refrain from defaming Kerala
 unhone kaha ki shah or bijepi ke netaaon ko apane samarthakon se poochna chahie ki diviefai kaaryakarta kii hatya kyon hui
 In fact, an activist of the cpi-m's youth wing DYFI was murdered on July 11 last year, CPI (M) General Secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan also slammed Javadekar saying that he should study what Marxism is
 CPM ko congress kaa saathwahin congress ke varisht netaa ramesh chennitala ne kaha ki sangh dwaara kerala ko jihadi takaton kaa centre bataanaa uski hataasha kaa parichaayak he, kyonki ve log apana agenda rajya main lagu karne main naakaam ho gaye hai
 In poll-bound states, there is too much asking for animals
 gujarat chunaav se pehle congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke twit kii vajah se unka kutta ‘pidi’ soshal media par chaaya hua he
 Something similar was also seen during the UP assembly elections held earlier this year
 tab upi ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne apane bayaan ke jariye chunavi jang main ‘gadhaa’ utaar diya tha
 Himachal Pradesh is to vote on November 9
 is parvatiy rajya main bhi ek ‘pashu’ mudda bana hua he or wo he ‘bandar’
 To be right, 'terror of monkeys' is also a major electoral issue in Himachal
 himachalmen bandar ko mudda kisi netaa ne nahin banaaya he
 Rather, the people here are so upset with the terror of the monkeys that they are taking the promise of getting rid of the monkeys from the candidates standing in the election first
 yani himachal main mahangaai, bhrashtachar, berogari jaisaa hi ahm ban gaya he bandaron kaa mudda
 The gardener-farmers are upset because the monkeys destroy their crops and gardens
 kahani yahi nahin khatm hoti, bandar shimla or rajya ke anya paryaton sthalon par bhi jam kar utpaat machaate hai
 Tourists coming from India and abroad also take great fear from these monkeys
 palak jhapakate hi ye bandar khaane kaa saamaan jhatak kar le jate hai
 When opposed, these monkeys do not miss to attack
 rajya main anek log bandaron ke hamalon main ghayal ho chuke hai
 Some people have also lost their lives
 paanch saal sehimachalmen congress kii sarkaar he
 Prior to this, BJP had ruled the state for five years
 lekin bandaron kii samasya se naa to bijepi or naa hi congress paar paa pai
 Monkeys continue to be a major headache for governance
 himachal main virbhadra singh sarkaar ne bandaron ko logon se dur rakhane ke liye paaramparik totakon ke saath aadhunik takanic ko bhi aajamaaya lekin bandaron ke aage ek nahin chali
 In April last year, Himachal Pradesh Wildlife Department searched for modern jugaad to liberate people from the terror of monkeys in Shimla
 iske liye shimla main BSNL building par payalat project ke tahat Ultrasonic Monkey Repellent Sound Device ko lagaaya gaya
 It was thought that with this device the monkeys would run away many kilometers from there
 lekin bandaron ke aage ye divaais bhi kuch khaas nateeja nahin de pai
 On the other hand, there was a demand of the people living in the rural areas of Himachal that if this device is effective in driving away the monkeys, then it should be provided to the farmers
 mukhya sangrakshak van (vanya jeev) pi el chouhan bhi bandaron kii samasya ko jatil maanate hai
 At the same time, BJP leader and MP from Hamirpur Anurag Thakur also considers 'monkey terror' as one of the three main issues of Himachal elections
 thakur himachal chunaav main congress sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue teen bade muddon main ‘bhrashtachar’, ‘vikaas ke badale vinaash’ or ‘bandaron kaa aatank’ ginate hai
 Every year in Himachal, around 70 percent of the monkeys damage crores of crores of rupees
 shimla jaise shaharon main bandaron ke aatank kii vajah se bacchon ne khule main khelnaa band kar diya he
 In the city of Shimla alone, more than one and a half thousand monkeys have caused uproar
 puure himachal kii baat kii jaae to rajya main 4 lakh se adhik bandar hai
 It was not long when the issue of terror of the monkeys was heard loudly in the Himachal Pradesh Assembly
 himachal pradesh vanya praani vibhaag ne aatank kaa paryaay ban chuke bandaron ko maarane ke liye bandaron ko vermin (hanikaarak hinsak pashu) ghoshit karne kii maang kii thi
 The center has allowed the monkeys to kill them, declaring them vermin
 iske liye adhisuchana bhi jari kar di he
 But initially monkeys can be killed only in areas under Shimla Municipal Corporation
 ab in ilaakon main koi bhi bina vanya praani vibhaag kii ijaajat liye bandaron ko maar saktaa he
 Monkeys have been declared vermin for just 6 months
 baharhaal, jo bhi ho ‘bandar’ nehimachal ke siyaasi sangram main‘gadar’ machaa rakhaa he

 'he said,' What is this system of conducting elections from evms in which many evidences have come before us, so evms are constantly opposed in the whole country, and since the results today, the public has a lot of faith on this
 It will be over jabaki is maamle main desh kii adhiktar partiyon kaa chunaav ayog main yah kahana rahaa he ki iviem ke bajaaye bailat paper se chunaav karaayen
 Why do the Election Commission and BJP object to this
 na to chunaav ayog taiyaar he or na hi bhaajapa maanane ko taiyaar he to iskaa matlab kuch to gadabad he
 'at the same time Mayawati had said,' When there is no system of ballot, the people vote in evms but the public is not satisfied with it
 aaj puure desh main janata yah dekh rahi he or mujhe nahin lagata ki jis tareeke ke nattejey desh main aaye hai vah logon ke gale se nahin utar rahaa he
 Most of the parties are constantly asking the Election Commission to conduct elections with ballot instead of EVM, then why is the Election Commission and BJP objecting to it
 jab koi gadabad nahin he, dil main koi kaala nahin he to kyon nahi mataptr se chunaav karaaye ja rahe hai
 'he said,' Honorable Supreme Court should also seriously consider the demand for elections to be done through ballot, there is a strong demand from our honorable Supreme Court as well

 ' Assembly elections in Delhi will be fought with such vigor, now everyone is surprised

 isamen maine paaya ki votaron kii maansikta kis tarah se badalati he or media kaa kya role hota he
 Just a week ago, when i met people, people felt that they could not make up their mind and people were taking more of bjp's name in many places
 kiran bedi ke naam kii ghoshnaa haal main hi kii gai thi
 There was enthusiasm in the people, then i don't know what happened, i found that people started looking a bit confused, then BJP gave all its strength in Delhi

 People now started trying to know how much crowd was gathering in Arvind Kejriwal's rally and where people were talking, their voice also started changing
 laga aam aadmi party or bijepi main takkar he
 Then the media survey started coming and the Aam Aadmi Party started showing an edge
 maine chandani chowk main logon se poocha ki kya tivi akhabaaron ke survey se aapaki soch par asar padataa he
 i was amazed at how seriously people take newspapers and television
 log abhi bhi bijepi kaa naam le rahe the, magar aam aadmi kii party kaa jo voter chup tha ab media se khulkar bol rahaa tha
 But let me tell you one thing from the voters who speak in the media, you cannot guess what the truth is
 
 This is the reason why not all surveys are true and all exit polls
 saath hi sabhaaon main jutane vaali bheed bhi vot main badal jaae isamen bhi koi sachai nahin he, kyonki bheed kaise laai jaati he aap sabko pataa he

 During this period, the value of the yield increased only 2

 On May 10, a company named White Fox India is organizing Justin Bieber's concert to be held at DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai

 Tickets for this Justin Bieber concert have been sold at a very expensive price
 vahiin is concert main sonakshi sinha ke parform karne ko lekar kailash kher, armaan maalik or sona mahapatra jaise gayakon ne virodh jataayaa tha
 In an interview, singer Kailash Kher had said that Sonakshi's song is not right in front of a big artist like Justin Bieber, this will send a wrong message internationally because she is not a famous singer but an actress
 apni aane vaali film ‘barfi’ main abhinayta ranbir kapur gunge, bahere va abhinetri priyanka chopra khud main khoye rahane vaali ladki kaa charitra nibhaa rahe hai, lekin unka kahana he ki yah film viklaangata ke bare main nahin he
 Directed by Anurag Basu, this romantic comedy focuses on a boy named Murphy (ranbir Kapoor) whom everyone calls Barfi
 hameshaa logon ke saath hansi majaak or sharaaraten karne vaala yah ladkaa bhale hi kuch bol nahin paata or sun nahin saktaa phir bhi vah logon ko pasand he
 While Jhilmil (priyanka) is an autistic (autistic) girl
 film main tamil abhinetri elena decruige ne bhi kaam kiya he
 On releasing the first promo of the film on Monday night, Ranbir Kapoor said that this film should not be associated with disability
 yah ek sanyog hi he ki is film kaa ek kirdaar goonga baharaa or doosraa aatmalin he
 This is a love story
 unhone kaha, ‘yadi aap elena ke kirdaar ko dekhen to aap kabhi na khatm hone vaale romance ko mahasoos karenge, or yadi aap mere va priyanka ke bich kii prem kahani ko dekhenge to aapako dil ko chhu lene vaale romance kaa ahsaas hoga
 Like Ranbir, Priyanka also described the film as a film showing the love and happiness that happens in her life by not telling the film of dumb deaf

 Here is the 17th installment of 'bihar diary before election'
 
 
 jediu or sipiai kii deal main begusarai or baankaa seat sipiai ke khate main ai he or 'sushasan babu' ne monajir hasan kaa tikat kaat diya, shaayad kishanganj le jaakar patake den
 Here Monajir is booming, on the other side there is a fierce battle among the comrades
 jila cameti ne purv saansad or shikshak sangh ke netaa shatrughna singh kaa naam aage kiya, to kendriya cameti ne purv vidhayak or rajya cameti ke sachiv rajendra singh ko thope diya
 Shatrughan Babu Sharif is considered a man, the type who writes the article
 buddhijivi element he, to duusari taraf rajendra singh ke bahubaliyon main bhi kaaphi pratishtha he or log-baag kehete hai ki ve lojpa netaa surajbhaan ke bhi kareebi hai
 Rajendra Singh has received the support of CPI General Secretary AB Bardhan, while the local unit has written long letters against him
 kuch ne pad se istipha de diya he
 Seeing this condition of a cadre-based party, elders say that it is really going bad
 sushasan babu ne donon siten sipiai ko dekar thik hi kiya
 Despite the wave in the last election, his candidate was fielded in Banka in front of Digvijay Singh's wife and Independent candidate Putul Devi
 lahar main begusarai se monajir saansad ban gaye the, lekin bhoomiharon ke garh main aisa hona apwaad hi tha
 For the first time in the history of independent India, Begusarai may have become a non-bhumihar MP
 kah sakate hai ki begusarai commeredon ke liye masco tha or bhoomiharon ke liye makka
 The only industrial area in Bihar remaining after the separation of Jharkhand was Begusarai's Barauni, where refineries, fertilizers and power-making factories survived
 barauni bihar kaa behad mahatvapurn rail jankshan bhi he, jahaan se uttar-purv kii adhiktar trainen jaati hai
 The first bridge connecting North and South Bihar was not built here around Patna, when Shri Babu (shri Krishna Singh) was the Chief Minister
 kalantar main begusarai, bihar kii saanskrithik rajdhani ban gai
 Perhaps the reason for this was that the government industrial units started giving sponsorship for various cultural programs to be held here, which was not destined to other areas of Bihar
 lekin lalu yug ke baad se jis tarah se bihar main communist partiyon kaa patan hua, vah vah dekhne laayak he
 Overnight, many comrades turned into Brahmins and Yadavas and communist parties piled up
 ek samay tha, jab puure bihar se communist samooh chah-chah loksabhaa siten jeetta tha
 In Madhubani there was Comrade Bhogendra Jha, who ended the election career of Jagannath Mishra, while Subodh Rai of CPM in Bhagalpur
 aise main begusarai main commeredon kii aapasi ladaai use kahaan le jaaegi, samaj paanaa bahut mushkil nahin he
 a sample of the manner in which the land of Dinkarji has recently changed from 'lal' to 'saffron' is that now 'kumbh' is being started here in Simaria and the arguments are being gathered by searching for it
 (yah vishleshan swatantra patrkaar sushant jha ne likhaa he
 These days he is writing this series in the name of 'bihar diary before election'
 ) a clean election is one that is conducted not only in a free, fair, peaceful manner but also by the people that yes, it has been done in a free and fair manner
 yah dharna asal main bahut myne rakhti he kyonki usamen hissaa lene waalon ko agar yah lag gaya ki chunaav prakriya pakshpatpurna, gaiyr-javabdeh yaa bhrasht he to ve apana makasad hasil karne ke liye tayshuda dharre se alag koi doosraa hi rasta akhriyaar kar sakate hai or chunavi hinsa par utar sakate hai
 At times, electoral violence is also used as an alternative to not allowing voters who are in the opposition or to the end to come to the polling booth
 isliye chunaav ke intjaam main lage logon ke liye yah jaruri he ki chunaav prakriya ko takaraav or hinsa se bachaane ke vaaste suraksha or kanoon-vyavastha ke kadai se paalan kaa intjaam karaaen
 Election managers should also be vigilant about possible non-violent methods such as silent booth capturing
 kuch matdaan kendron par ye yuktiyaan bhi kaam main laai jaati hai
 Violence during elections in India is mainly due to various social and electoral discrepancies in Indian society
 hamaare samaaj kii vividhta kai tarah kii chunautiyaan pesh karti he
 It has many underpinnings such as caste mobilization, communal divisions, economic inequality, various regional and linguistic aspirations
 ye sab apni bhoomika nibhaati hai
 All these elements become even more sensitive and important during elections
 maujuuda halaat main chunaav main hinsa or asuraksha kii badi vajah raajnneeti main badhata apradheekaran, baahubal or dhanabal kii bhoomika main ijapha he
 The threat to the election process is not just from external elements, but the conduct of election officials can also pose a threat
 bhrasht yaa rajnatik partiyon ke prati sahanubhuti rakhane vaale adhikari bhi chunavi prakriya main gadabadi paidaa kar sakate hai
 The Election Commission does not spare even senior police officers or bureaucrats in high positions when they look a little suspicious
 chunaav prakriya shuru hone ke kuch hafte pehle hi unka puraa record mangakar rakh liya jaataa he
 The complaints of political parties against the officers are considered seriously and the officer is immediately transferred as soon as the Election Commission feels that a fair officer can affect the fairness of the election
 amuman khufia vibhaag yaa suraksha se jude un police adhikariyon ko nahin chhedaa jaataa, jo sidhe chunaav ke prabandhan se jude hon, lekin kai baar aise maukey bhi aae ki un par karrwai karnaa behad jaruri ho gaya
 The biggest example of this is the 2011 incident in Tamil Nadu
 rajya ke daure par gaye hamaare adhikariyon ne bataaya ki edijipi (khufia vibhaag) ke pad par baithe ek varisht police afasar rajnatik mansoobey se rajya ke vibhinn police adhikshakon or diiji vagairah ko bulaakar kuch nirdesh de rahe hai
 He had a lot of influence over the police officers due to his political influence
 aisi shikaayatein mil rahi thim or andeshaa bhi tha ki ve apane pad kaa istemaal sattarudh party ko phayda pahunchane ke liye karenge
 After taking stock of the situation, the Election Commission came to the conclusion that it would be better to keep this officer away from the spot during the election for fair process
 ayog main ham sabhi suraksha yaa khufia adhikariyon ko na chhedgaye kii apni niti se hatane main sankoch kar rahe the
 The officer was summoned to the headquarters of the Commission for talks and it was said that he was being sent as an observer in West Bengal
 yah sunakar ve dang rah gaye or hamen prabhavit karne ke liye unhone ek kahani garh lee
 He said that he has the intelligence to disturb the LTTE elections and to target three national leaders (also named three leaders)
 hamaara shaq yah tha ki ve apane pad par bane rahane ke liye yah bahaanaa bana rahe hai
 We thought that to prove their point 'right', they could make some mess here and there
 phir, hamane unase sidhe apana andeh jaahir karne kaa man banaaya or kaha ki agar kahin kuch bhi gadabadi hui, to hamaara pehla andeh unheen par jayega
 This made sense
 ve chuttee par jane or is dauraan tamilnadu se baahar rahane ko raji ho gaye
 He actually stayed out of the state during the election
 ve chuttee par malaysia chale gaye the
 It was important to take such a unique step because in the opinion of the people, the credibility of the election remains, it is most important
 haalanki maamla sulajh gaya tha, phir bhi saavdhaanee ke taur par maine mukhya sachiv gopal pillai se baat kii
 He said that the threat of LTTE is nonsense
 unhone isaki do vajahen ginaayin: ek, altitii kii dhamkee puraani thi or duusare, isaki soochna dene vaala adhikari kai maah pehle pronnati paakar kisi or pad par ja chukaa tha

 When traveling in economy class, what is new in this? Don't know why people are making this thing such a big issue? Linking Aamir Khan's economy travel with politics, a user wrote - Aamir Khan is feeling safe in India because there is Modi here

 Kerala Chief Minister VS Achuthanandan has termed Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan's statement that he has accused the Kerala government of not providing information to the Center about the vigilance probe against former Chief Vigilance Commissioner PJ Thomas
 achyutanandan ne buudhvaar raat jari kiye gaye ek bayaan main kaha he ki rajya sarkaar ne do disambar 2008 ko centre sarkaar ko likhe ek patr main pamolin ghotaale main thomas ke khilaaf jaanch chalane kii jaankaree de di thi
 Achuthanandan said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also admitted in Parliament that Thomas was appointed to the post of CVC due to a lapse by the Department of Personnel and Training (dopt)
 unhone kaha ki shaq ke daayre main aane ke kaaran chavaan ab kerala sarkaar par dosha madhne ke asafal prayaas kar rahe hai
 Significantly, before becoming the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Chavan was the head of this department
 unhone maharashtra vidhansabha main kaha tha ki thomas kii niyukti kerala sarkaar dwaara centre ko die gaye dastavejon ke aadhaar par hi hui thi, jisamen unhen is pad ke liye upyukt bataaya gaya tha
 Just before the assembly elections in Rajasthan, a political battle has started between Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia and the central BJP over the state president
 is siyaasi jang main pradesh adhyaksh koun bane iske liye raaje sarkaar ke 20 se zyada mantriyon or 20 vidhayakon ne bijepi adhyaksh or kendriya netritv par dawaab banane ke liye dilli main deraa daalaa hua he
 According to sources, Amit Shah wants Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Minister of State for Agriculture in the Modi government, to be made the state president , while more than 20 ministers of the Raje government and all Jat mlas are against making Shekhawat the state president
 jat ho jaaenge naaraajaraaje se lekar dilli aae sabhi mantriyon or vidhayakon kaa mat he ki gajendra singh shekhavat ko pradesh banaae jane se rajasthan menjaton kii naaraazgibad jaaegi
 After Rajput Chief Minister in the state, being the state president of this community will not send a good message to the Jats
 is faisle kii keemat party ko aagaamee vidhansabha main chukaani pad sakati he
 In fact, Vasundhara Raje Scindia has a problem with Gajendra Singh Shekhawat becoming the state president, that a leader of his class will stand in the Rajputs in the state
 somvaar ko jin mantriyon ne sanghathan mahasachiv raamalaal se mulaaqaat kar gajendra singh shekhavat ke khilaaf apni naaraazgi bataa di unamem rajyasabha saansad ramnarayan dudhi, younus khan, rajendra singh rathore, ram pratap, prabhulaal saini, ajay kilak, surendrapal singh shaamil hai
 Apart from this, many other mlas have reached Delhi
 party mahasachiv raamalaal ne rajasthan se aaye sabhi mantriyon or vidhayakon ko bharosa diya or kaha ki pradesh adhyaksh faisla sabaki sahmati se hoga
 Everyone knows that the final decision has to be taken by PM Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah
 adhyaksh par jald hoga faislasutron kii maane to agle ek do-din main rajasthan bijepi ke nae pradesh adhyaksh ke naam kii ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 The BJP leader, who belongs to the Rajasthan BJP, believes that the way the results of the by-elections were held in 2 Lok Sabha and one Assembly seats, it seems that the people are angry with the organization and the government
 aise main sanghathan or pradesh sarkaar main badlaav karnaa chahie
 Just 6 months before the assembly elections, the way the political battle between Amit Shah and Vasundhara Raje started with the state president is reminiscent of 2009
 tab bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne raaje ko vipaksh kii netaa ke pad se istifa dene ko kaha tha
 But for three months, Vasundhara Raje did not resign and the entire party, including Rajnath Singh, had to be defeated
 raaje ke liye naak kaa sawalsiem raaje ko bhi pataa he ab kii unki ladaai rajnath singh se balki piem modi ke senapati or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se he
 Last time there was a long list of backers who supported him, including leaders like LK Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu
 lekin is baar unhen ladaai akele apane dam par ladani he
 If Vasundhara manages to stop Shekhawat from becoming the state president this time, then the next state president will neither be a Rajput nor a Jat
 sutron kii maane to raaje apana daanv purv pradesh adhyaksh arun chaturvedi, lakshminarayan dave, shrichand kriplani par laga rahi hai
 On the other hand, in addition to Amit Shah Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Arjun Ram Meghwal, Madan Lal Saini and Satish Punia want to be seen as the President of Rajasthan
 amit shah ko pichley hafte madhyapradesh main nae pradesh adhyaksh ke liye jabalpur se saansad rakesh singh ke naam kii ghoshnaa karne main koi dikkat nahin ai
 But the way in Rajasthan, there are opposing voices about the state president, this may harm the party in the assembly elections as well as in 2019
 amit shah jaanate hai ki sanghathan ko majboot karte-karte chunaav haath se nahin nikal jaye
 This is the reason that they are blowing every step in the case of Rajasthan

 Protests under the banner of Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh will hand over letters to the mps against RCEP against the Kisan Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement
 saath hi aarasieepi ke khilaaf pradhanmantri narendra modi ke naam jila colector karyaalayon ko khat saunpenge
 This nationwide agitation of farmers will be under the banner of National Farmers Federation
 isse pehle dilli main 10 oktober ko rashtriya kisaan mahasang ne baithak kii thi or aarasieepi ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan kiya tha
 Also, at Jantar Mantar, the effigy of Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal was burnt
 is baithak main hi 18 oktober ko deshvyapee virodh pradarshan karne kaa bhi faisla liya gaya tha
 Farmer leaders from 15 states attended this meeting
 rashtriya kisaan mahasang ke rashtriya pravaktaa abhimanyu kohaad ke mutabik 18 oktober se deshbhar ke sabhi kisaan kaali pattee baandhakar aarasieepi kaa virodh karenge
 All mps in the country will be given a demand to boycott RCEP
 saath hi desh ke sabhi jilon main jila colector offis par pradhanmantri ke naam aarasieepi ke khilaaf khat saunpa jayega
 After this, road stop demonstrations will be held across the country for 3 hours on 2 November
 rashtriya kisaan mahasang ke rashtriya pravaktaa abhimanyu kohaad ne bayaan jari kar kaha ki agar sarkaar ne aarasieepi samjhaute kaa bahishkaar nahin kiya, to deshbhar main rashtriya kisaan mahasang dwaara gaanv band andolan chalaaya jayega
 What is RCEP, why farmers are opposing? Under the RCEP of ASEAN countries and 6 other major countries, there is a proposal to include dairy products in the Free Trade Agreement, which farmers are opposing
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki agar aarasieepi lagu ho gaya or baahar se doodh kaa aayaat kiya gaya to doodh ke kisaan puure tarah se tabah ho jaaenge
 One-third of the country's market will be occupied by New Zealand, America and European countries and the price of their produce is going to fall in the farmers of India
 rashtriya kisaan mahasang kaa kahana he ki bharat main zyaadaatar kisaanon ke paas 2 se 4 gaayen hai, jinke doodh se unka parivaar chalata he
 On the other hand, New Zealand farmers have 1000–1000 cows
 aarasieepi samjhauta hone se 90 fisadi vastuon par aayaat shulk jiro ho jayega
 This will completely break the back of Indian industries and farmers
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan upi main bijepi kaa chamaatkaarik pradarshan sunishchit karne vaale amit shah ke saamne ab badi jimmedaari he
 He is now the president of the party and the responsibility of running it is on his shoulders
 lekin shah ke saamne chunautiyaan bhi kam nahin he
 a look at these challenges party ke puraane yoddhaon kaa sammaan sunishchit karte hue yuvaaon ko aage laana unke liye badi chunauti he
 Identifying young leaders who are capable of running the party at the national level
 taaki un netaaon kii jagah bhari ja sake, jo modi sarkaar main shaamil ho gaye
 2
 amit shah rashtriya swayan sevak sangh ke paramparaagat netaaon kii tarah nahin he
 Like Rajnath Singh
 shah ke kaam karne kaa andaaj profeshnal he or uski kai paraten he
 Where there is a lack of transparency
 saath hi kader ke saath unka judaav halkaa he
 Elections can be won on the basis of strategy and survey, but running a party is a different thing
 3
 Ensuring bjp's victory in the assembly elections of Maharashtra, Bihar, Haryana, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh
 saath hi alpsankhyakon ko bataanaa ki bijepi unka hit sochati he
 This is a major challenge for Shah in states like Bihar
 bengal or upi main bhi muslim aabaadi kam nahin he
 4
 bijepi ke bheetar hi kshetreey netaaon ke ubhaar ko sanbhaalanaa or shivasena jaise sahyogiyon ko handle karnaa, shah ke liye badi chunauti hogi
 Apart from this, the social and economic challenges of parties like SP and TMC will also have to be explored
 5
 We sincerely hope that establishing the party in South India will be at the top of their priority
 karnataka bijepi kii pakad se dur hota gaya, to telugana main bijepi kaa koi majboot aadhaar nahin he
 At the same time, BJP has to make its place in states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala
 vahiin north east ke rajyon main congress ke varchasv ko todna hoga
 6
 unhen is baat ko bhi sunishchit karnaa hoga ki party kaa vikaas or uski jaruratein, sarkaar kii mohataaj naa rahen

 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi may have left no stone unturned to oust former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) organization General Secretary Sanjay Joshi, but Joshi himself says he has no hatred for anyone
 unhone dilli se lekar gujarat tak chale poster waar par bhi apana paksh saaf karte hue kaha he ki aisa karne vaale bhaajapa ke shubhachintak nahin ho sakate
 Actually, Sanjay Joshi has issued an appeal to the BJP workers, in which these things have been said
 unhone yah kehete hue ki unke liye dal or vichaardhaara sarvopari he, kaaryakartaaon se apil kii he ki koi bhi aisa poster, parchaa na jari karen or na hi koi abhiyaan chalaaen jo kisi ek netaa yaa netaaon ke khilaaf ho
 It would be against the goal
 isse pehle modi ke dabaav main bhaajapa dwaara pehle to sanjay joshi ko kaaryakarini se baahar kiye jane or uske baad unka istipha sweekaar kar liye jane ke baad kai dinon tak dilli se lekar gujarat or desh ke kai hisson main unke naam or tasviir ke saath poster lagane ke ghatnaayen saamne ai thim
 The perpetrators of such incidents were said to be anti-modi and pro-joshi
 khud bhaajapa ne ise party virdohi asaamaajik tatwon kaa haath qaraar diya tha
 Joshi has said in his appeal, 'on these incidents i have made it clear earlier that those who do this cannot be well wishers of BJP
 yah kaary shadyantrkariyon kaa he
 i appeal to the party workers and well-wishers not to issue any kind of posters, pamphlets nor carry out any campaign in my favor
 'unhone kaha, 'maine hameshaa hi party ke kartavya ko apane se bada mana he
 The importance of the person is due to the party
 mere liye dal or vichaardhaara sarvopari he
 BJP is there only then we are, so we should not take any such step which will harm BJP
 is samay desh kii jaisi haalat he, usamen poster yaa anya aise abhiyaanon kaa virdohi phayda uthaane kii koshish kar sakate hai
 They can also conspire to discredit the party and leaders
 inase bachane kii jarurat he
 "modi may have a hand in Joshi's departure from the party, but Joshi himself says," i would like to clarify that i do not hate anyone
 isliye koi bhi aisa poster, parchaa yaa abhiyaan kisi ek netaa yaa netaaon ke khilaaf ho, yah dhyey viruddh hoga
 This is the time to act in the party's interest with discretion and patience
 'unhone kaha ki aaj desh mahangaai or bhrashtachar jaise vikat samasyaon se jujh rahaa he jiskaa datakar muqabla karne kii jarurat he
 At such a time, we need to strengthen the campaign against the deaf and dumb government at the center, which is irresponsible to the interests of the common man
 ullekhneey he ki modi ke dabaav main joshi ko pehle to kaaryakarini se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya gaya or phir baad main party kii ore se kaha gaya he ki unhone party chhodane kaa aagrah kiya tha, jise adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne sweekaar kar liya
 After this Joshi, however, said that he had requested not to be relieved from the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh but the party
 baharhaal, joshi ne bhaajapa ke letterhed par yah apil jari kii he

 28 sitambar ko laga raashtrapati shashan 30 oktober yani 32 dinon tak lagu rahaa
 What is the provision related to constitutional system of President's rule is given in Article 356 of the Constitution
 artical 356 ke mutabik raashtrapati kisi bhi rajya main raashtrapati shashan laga sakate hai yadi ve is baat se santusht hon ki rajya sarkaar samvidhan ke vibhinn praavdhaanon ke mutabik kaam nahin kar rahi he
 It is not necessary that the President take this decision only on the basis of the report of the Governor of that state
 yah anuchhed ek saadhan he jo centre sarkaar ko kisi naagarik ashaanti jaise ki dange se nipatane main rajya sarkaar vifal rahi ho, kii dasha main kisi rajya sarkaar par apana adhikaar sthapit karne main sakasham banaata he
 It is also mentioned in the constitution that within two months of imposition of President's rule, it is necessary to ratify it by both the Houses of Parliament
 kab lagata he raashtrapati shashanrashtrapati shashan tab lagu kiya jaataa he jab kisi sadan main kisi party yaa gathbandhan ke paas spasht bahumat naa ho
 The Governor can keep the House in a 'suspended state' for a period of 6 months
 6 maheene ke baad, yadi phir koi spasht bahumat praapt naa ho to us dasha main pun: chunaav yojit kiye jate hai
 If President's rule is approved by both the Houses of Parliament then President's rule will continue for 6 months
 is prakaar 6-6 maah kar ise 3 varsh tak aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he

 JDU supported the citizenship bill in both houses of parliament
 haalanki, party ke is faisle kaa rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor virodh kar rahe hai
 Prashant Kishore also tweeted on Thursday, opposing the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC)
 We are told that # cabis bill to grant citizenship and not to take it from anyone
 But the truth is together with # NRC, it could turn into a lethal combo in the hands of government to systematically discriminate and even prosecute people based on religion

 unhone twitor par likhaa, 'is bill kaa samarthan karne se pehle jediu netritv ko un logon ke bare main sochna chahie tha, jinhone 2015 main party par bharosa or vishwaas jataayaa tha
 Many other leaders were also angry, not only Kishore Prashant Kishore, but senior leader of bulkparty, Pawan Kumar Verma also urged the party president Nitish Kumar to reconsider it
 While supporting # CAB, the JDU leadership should spare a moment for all those who reposed their faith and trust in it in 2015
 We must not forget that but for the victory of 2015, the party and its managers would not have been left with much to cut any deal with anyone
 — Prashant Kishor (@prashantkishor)december 11, 2019isse pehle prashanth kishor ne twit kar apni naaraazgi jaahir karte hue likhaa, naagarikta sanshodhan bill par jediu ke samarthan se niraashaa hui

 Taking a dig at the party, PK wrote that the jdu's support of the Citizenship Amendment bill is different from the party's constitution, which already has the word secularism written on the page thrice
