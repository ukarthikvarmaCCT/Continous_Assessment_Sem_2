 ye paanch sawaal to kapil mishra se bhi poochna jaruri he? clic kar padhein--kumaar vishwaas ne sabase pehle mishra kii barkhaastagi kii vajah poochi
 He was upset with this action
 is par manish sisodiya ne poocha ki kya wo mishra ke haalia twits ko sweekaar kar sakate hai? unke saamne emsidi chunaavon main haar se judi report pesh kii gai jisamen kareeb 50 party vidhayakon ne unke halkon main jal sankat ko haar kii vajah bataaya tha
 -kumar Biswas admitted that Kickpil Mishra should have complained on the party forum instead of raising questions on Twitter
 sanjay singh or manish sisodiya ne kumaar vishwaas se kaha ki agar kapil ko tanker ghotaale kaa khulaasa karnaa tha to wo aisa karan ke liye swatantra the
 But what did he need to say to tell Kejriwal falsely? - Kumar Vishwas asked Kejriwal if he had met Kapil Mishra in this regard? Kejriwal denied this
 unka kahana tha ki wo mishra ke saarvajanik taur par jhooth bolne se aahat hai
 Kejriwal also said that the party and the PAC believe that only the Chief Minister can make a final decision on who will be in the cabinet
 -is baat par kumaar vishwaas ne jawaab diya ki mishra ko bharose main lekar baad main ye faisla liya ja saktaa tha
 After this, Kumar Vishwas left from the meeting
 unhone kaha ki wo kapil mishra se baat karenge
 It was already 11 in the morning
 -thodi der baad wo kejariwal ke ghar pichley daravaaje se waapas laute
 Gopal Rai, Satyendar Jain and Dilip Pandey joined the meeting after Kumar Vishwas left
 - is maukey par kumaar vishwaas ne meeting main shaamil netaaon ko bataaya ki wo kapil se baat nahin kar paa rahe hai
 After this, the leaders involved in the meeting heard Kapil's allegations on TV
 mishra ke bayaan par sabhi sakate main aa gaye
 Baffled Vishwas said that he cannot believe Kapil Mishra's allegations at all
 -kuch der charchaa ke badkumar vishwaas ne manaki kapil mishra ne apni had paar kii he
 Manish Sisodia asked if Mishra's statement was not as serious as Amanatullah's allegations? Can any party leader believe these irresponsible allegations against Kejriwal? —kumar Vishwas agreed with Manish Sisodia
 unhone kaha ki wo amanatulla ke aaropon se bhi itnaa aahat nahin hue the
 According to him, he cannot think of such a thing about Kejriwal despite differences
 -kejariwal ne netaaon se kaha ki mishra ke aaropon kaa jawaab dene kii koi jarurat nahin he
 However, he is surprised that Kapil Mishra can fall to such an extent
 -kumaar ko salaah di gai ki wo is masalaper bayaan naa den
 But Kumar Vishwas said that on this occasion it is necessary that the party should send a message in uniform
 lihaaja wo bayaan denge
 Kumar Vishwas also said that the allegations against Satyendra Jain should also be considered seriously
 unki raay main party or leadership kisi aise netaa kaa bachaav karte hue najar nahin aa sakati jisapar bhrashtachar kaa jaraa bhi daag ho
 He asked Satyendra Jain to present the documents in his defense at the next PAC meeting
 iske baad satyendra jain ke bare main aakhri faisla hoga
 -party leaders were unanimous that Kapil Mishra has crossed his limits
 lekin unpar karrwai ke bare main koi baat nahin hui
 On this occasion, Kumar Vishwas became emotional
 unhone doharaaya ki chaahe kuch bhi ho jaae wo ye yakeen nahin kar sakate ki kejariwal bhrasht hai
 Kumar Vishwas also said that if supporters feel that the factions within the party are attacking each other, then it would be suicidal
 isliye netritv main ekarey kaayam hone tak kisi ke bhi khilaaf ection nahin hona chahie
 Sanjay Singh asked Kumar Vishwas that why did Kapil Mishra not tell when he saw Kejriwal taking Rs 2 crore? In his opinion CCTV footage should confirm this
 unhone kaha ki mishra ko bataanaa chahie ki satyendra jain se kejariwal ke koun se rishtedaar ko jameen ke saude main madad kii he
 He alleged that Mishra is plotting to end the party
 kumaar vishwaas ne doharaaya ki ise bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa

" '' In Jharkhand, along with the Lok Sabha next year, the Chief Minister Raghubar Das government has to face the assembly elections
 teen rajyon main apni party kii sarkaar ko kisaanon ke aakrosh kaa saamana jaise karnaa padaa he uske baad mukhyamantri raghubar das ne kisaanon ke kiye sarkari khazaana khol diya he
 On Friday, the Jharkhand government announced in a decision to give Rs 5000 per acre to every farmer in the state and farmers who have less than one acre of land will be given the same amount, but this scheme and amount only for Kharif crops Will apply
 is yojana kaa naam mukhyamantri krishi aashirwad yojana rakhaa gaya he or isse rajya ke chote or madhyam kisaanon ko laabh milegaa
 The government estimates that the scheme will cost more than Rs 2200 crore, but when the amount is directly transferred to the farmers' account in the state, then they will not have to depend on anyone for fertilizer and seeds
 is yojana kii sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki kisaanon ko ye raashi fasal utpaadan ke baad unhen lautaani nahin hogi
 How many farmers committed suicide in the country since 2016? The Modi government does not have the figures
 It is believed that this scheme is being implemented so that the Raghubar Das government does not have to face the indignation of the farmers in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 mukhyamantri raghubar das ko ummid thi ki centre sarkaar kisaanon kii karz maafi kii koi na koi yojana laaegi lekin usamen ho rahe vilamb se nipatane ke liye sarkaar ne is yojana kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Although the farmers are given money directly in the farmers' account in the erstwhile state of Bihar in the name of Agricultural Input Scheme for direct crop production, but Jharkhand will be the first state where an amount of Rs 5000 will be given in the account of every farmer for Kharif crops

 hooda kaa kaddavar cheharaa or jati sameekaran aayaa kamshok tanvar 6 saal main ek bhi chunaav nahin jita sakecongress haryana main dalit-jat sameekaran kii kavayadvidhansabha chunaav se ain pehle haryana congress main bade badlaav ke kiye gaye he
 Former Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda's threat to leave the Congress came in handy
 congress haikaman ne ashok tanvar se haathon se pradesh adhyaksh kii kaman lekar purv kendriya mantri kumari shailaja ko saunpi he
 The Congress top leadership has decided to make Hooda the chairman of the election campaign committee and chairman of the Congress Legislature Party in the Haryana Assembly elections
 isse saaf jaahir he ki congress ne bhupendra hooda ke chehre ke sahare chunavi maidan main utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 There was a continuous confrontation between Congress state president Ashok Tanwar and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the brunt of which came to the fore in the Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad bhupendra singh hooda lagaataar haryana main congress adhyaksh ko badalane kaa dabaav bana rahe the or idhar kuch maheenon se unke tewaron se lag rahaa tha ki agar haikaman ne nahin suni to vah apana rasta alag bhi kar sakate hai
 Senior journalist Shakeel Akhtar says that Ashok Tanwar is completely failing as state president
 unke netritv main congress ek bhi chunaav nahin jeet saki
 Not only this, Tanwar has also failed to keep his Dalit community connected with the Congress
 jabaki haryana kii siyasat main congress ke paas bhupendra singh hooda se bada koi cheharaa nahin he
 Keeping this in mind, Hooda has also been tried to help the Jats of Haryana by making him the leader of the Congress Legislature Party in the Assembly and the President of the State Election Committee
 ashok tanvar ko haryana main congress kii kaman 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle farvari main saunpi gai thi, us samay haryana kii satta main congress kabiz thi
 In 2014 and 2019, two Lok Sabha and one Assembly elections were held under Tanwar's leadership, but he could not win a single election to Congress
 2014 ke baad se lagaataar haryana main congress ke graph main giravat ai he
 As a result, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress could not even open an account in the state
 varisht patrkaar arvind singh kehete hai ki congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne na sirf hooda ko manaa liya balki haryana pradesh congress main netritv parivartan karke kumari shailaja ko kaman saunp kar congress ke paramparaagat dalit janaadhar ko bhi apane saath jode rakhane kaa daanv chalaa he
 Singh says that along with Hooda being a grassroots and mass base leader, he has all the resources
 congress ke bade netaaon se bhi hooda ke behatar sambandh hai, jiske chalate vah sonia se apni baat manwaane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 Arvind Singh says that due to Rahul Gandhi, Ashok Tanwar remained the President of Haryana Congress for the last six years, but during this time neither he could stand the organization nor unite his caste in favor of the party
 yahi baat unke khilaaf gai he
 While Hooda rallied in Rohtak on August 18, he was able to convey his strength to the Congress leadership
 saath hi hooda ko naaraaz kar congress jat virdohi hone kaa tamgaa apane naam nahin karnaa chaahati thi
 The same thing has worked to strengthen Hooda
 haryana main hooda or shailaja ke jariye haryana kii raajnneeti main congress jaaton or daliton kaa majboot gathbandhan banane kii koshish karegi
 Due to the mutual battle of the Chautala family, 30 percent of the Jats of Haryana can now become the first choice of Bhupendra Singh Hooda
 saath hi pradesh kii kareeb 20 fisadi dalit aabaadi main kumari shailaja or unke pita kii lokapriyata congress ke paramparaagat dalit janaadhar ko ekajute kar sakati he
 Given this political equation, Sonia Gandhi is forced to remove Tanwar and accept Hooda's terms

 satoriyon kaa andaja he ki shivasena ko 70-75 siten milengi auki bijepi ko 20-25 siten
 If the bookies believe that no single party or coalition will get a clear majority this time, then it will be difficult to retain the tier BMC of Raj Thackeray's MNS seats

 Apart from this, Goyal said on the new alliance formed in UP, 'we will go before the country, the opposition has complete freedom to do whatever it wants to do

 The description of Prakash Parv, Deepawali is seen in various religions of the world
 is tyohaar ko manaane ke peeche alag-alag kaaran bataae jate hai lekin sabhi maton main antim nishkarsh ke rup main ise andhkaar par prakaash kii jeet kaa utsav bataaya gaya he
 It is believed in Hinduism about Deepawali that on this day in Treta Yug, Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile and slaying of Ravana
 isi khushi main ayodhyavasiyon ne samoochee nagari ko deepon ke prakaash se jagamag kar jashn manaaya tha or is tarah tabhi se deepawali kaa parv manaaya jane laga
 Shriram Sharma Acharya has written that there is a description of Deepawali in Buddhism and Jainism as well
 baudhon ke praakrit jataka main diwali jaise tyohaar kaa zikr he jiskaa aayojan karthik maheene main kiya jaataa he
 The Jain people associate it with Maha Nirvana of Mahavir Swami
 kaha jaataa he ki kareeb dhai hajaar varsh purv karthik krishna chaturdashi kii raat main paava nagari main bhagwaan mahavir kaa nirvana hua
 On hearing the news of Mahavira's nirvana, sur asura humans, nag gandharvas etc
 gathered in large numbers
 raat andheri thi isliye devon ne dipakon se prakaash kar utsav manaaya or usee din karthik amavasya ko praat:kaal unke shishy indramurti gautam ko gyaan lakshmi kii prapti hui
 Since then Deepawali started being celebrated on this day
 bhartiya utsavon ke bare main vishesh jaankaree rakhane vaale ke
 K
 shastri ke anusaar deepawali ke bare main ek manyata yah bhi he ki jab raja bali ne devataaon ke saath lakshmi ji ko bhi bandhak bana liya tab bhagwaan vishnu ne vaaman rup main isi din unhen mukt karaayaa tha
 It is said in the Puranas that Deepawali brings the message of proper procurement and proper use of Lakshmi
 deepon kaa parv deepawali aaj atyaadhunik rup le chukaa he
 Outside the country, its popularity has also spread abroad
 purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee, mashhoor gayak- sangeetkaar bhupen hajarika or bhartiya jansangh ke purv netaa or prakhyat samajasevi nanaaji deshmukh ko bharat ratna diya jayega
 This big announcement was made by the government on Saturday evening
 inamen se bhupen hajarika or nanaaji deshmukh ko maranoparant yah sammaan diya jayega
 Two of the three personalities - Pranab Mukherjee and Bhupen Hazarika belong to Eastern India
 jaise hi yah khabar saamne ai raajnneetik galiyaaron main halchal tej ho gai
 In such a situation, the political implications of this announcement are being extracted
 raajnneetik galiyaaron main jaankaar ise bijepi sarkaar kaa master stroke maan rahe hai
 If seen, the BJP government has tried to control Assam's politics through West Bengal and Bhupen Hazarika with the help of Pranab Mukherjee
 tamaam survey vagairah ko dekhte hue jaankaar yah kah rahe hai ki bijepi ko hindi pattee ke rajyon jaise - uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh, bihar, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main nuksaan ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, the party's eye can be focused on eastern India, where the potential losses in north and central India can be compensated
 aise main pranab mukherjee or bhupen hajarika ko bharat ratna sammaan die jane ko log is ranneeti se bhi jodakar dekh rahe hai
 Pranab Mukherjee is named with respect across the country
 ve raashtrapati banane se pehle vitt mantri, videsh mantri jaise ahm mantralayon ko sambhaal chuke hai
 Let us know that the BJP is trying to establish its roots in West Bengal
 kuch samay pehle hue panchayat chunaav main bijepi ne rajya main acha pradarshan kiya tha
 Now the party has a 2019 challenge, where it has a direct fight with the Trinamool Congress led by the Chief Minister of the state, Mamata Banerjee
 pranab mukherjee jivan bhar congress kii vichaardhaara ke saath rahe
 Except a few years, his entire political life also passed in the Congress party
 lekin pichley kuch varshon main pranab mukherjee or bijepi-sangh ke rishte charchaa main rahe hai
 The issue had not caught up when Pranab Mukherjee went to Nagpur in June 2018 to participate in a program of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 us samay congress party main ek tabaka aisa bhi tha jo nahin chahta tha ki mukherjee sangh ke kaarykram main hissaa len
 However, despite these things, Mukherjee went to Nagpur
 jahaan tak baat bhupen hajarika kii he
 He is considered one of the most influential cultural figures of modern times coming from Eastern India
 assam samet puure purvi bharat main unka naam bahut sammaan se liya jaataa he
 Obviously, the people of Assam will be very happy with this decision
 gauratlab he ki assam main bijepi ne pehali baar apane boote sarkaar banaai he or uske saamne 2019 kii chunauti he
 The party is facing opposition from a section of Assam over the citizenship amendment bill
 aise main bhupen ko desh kaa sabase bada naagarik sammaan dekar bijepi ne assam kii kshetreey asmita ko ek tarah se salaam kiya he
 Experts believe that this decision will have a good political impact on the people of Assam
 nanaaji deshmukh aresas main bataur prachaarak lambey samay tak kaam kiya
 After independence, he held important party posts in Uttar Pradesh after the formation of Bharatiya Jana Sangh
 ve vinoba bhaave ke bhudaan andolan main bhi sakriy rahe
 At the age of 60, he said goodbye to active politics and ventured into the field of social service
 uttar pradesh ke gonda, maharashtra ke bid or madhya pradesh ke chitrakoot main nanaaji ne bade paimaane par samajaseva kii
 By giving Bharat Ratna to Nanaji, the BJP government has tried to give the message that the party does not forget those who are devoted to the ideology of the party

 Mahesh Shah is a common-looking man, but this is currently the most discussed city in Ahmedabad
 ye jaankaree saamne ai he ki inhone kendra sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi kaala dhan ko tex dekar safed karne kii vidiaies yojana main 13,860 karod rupee cash hone kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Shah, who lives in a common house, was required to pay 45 percent tax in four installments under this
 30 navambar se pehle inhen iskaa pehla 25 pratishat yani 1560 karod rupee jamaa karnaa tha lekin achaanak miyaad khatm hone se pehle inakam tex vibhaag ne 28 navambar ko hi puraa discloger radd karke 29 or 30 navambar ko iske auki inke sie tehmul sethna ke thikaanon par search kiya
 Tehmul says that he does not have solid knowledge of their business but they were a big thing
 wo kuch khaas padhe likhe nahin the, umrdaraj lekin bahut hi hoshiyaar aadmi tha
 He had contacts with very large people and he used to do big deals in the land, so he was unlikely to ever doubt his revelations
 blog padhein- oparation magaramchh : vir raja kii katha, ise notebandi se na joden Read- Jaitley told how the Income Tax Department decides who will be raided

 Did they feel anything? phir ye bhi he ki itnaa cash rakhanevaala insaan aakhir gaayab kahaan ho gaya
 He has no news for the last one week
 unke bare main bas itani jaankaree he ki wo gujarat, maharashtra or dakshin bharat main jameen kaa kaarobaar karata tha
 And questions are also arising whether this person also had a network and who were connected behind such huge black money
 aakhir gujarat main kaala dhan kaa itnaa bada maamla kaise bana
 Under this central government scheme, until September 30, the government could declare undisclosed income by paying 45 percent tax
 is yojana ke tahat aghoshit aay par tex chukaane ke baad aay kii svaichhik ghoshnaa karne vaale par iskar vibhaag kii taraf se koi karrwai nahin honi thi
 This is where Mahesh missed
 unhone 13 hajaar karod rupee aghoshit aay kii jaankaree iskar vibhaag ko di to sahi par tex chukaaye bina

 Then it is also where a person with so much cash disappeared
 pichley ek saptaah se unki koi khabar nahin he
 There is so much information about him that he used to do land business in Gujarat, Maharashtra and South India

 After all, how did such a big case of black money happen in Gujarat
 centre sarkaar kii is yojana ke tahat 30 sitambar tak sarkaar ko 45 pratishat tex dekar aghoshit aay ghoshit kii ja sakati thi

 Team India's off-spinner Ravichandan Ashwin reckoned with utter disdain that he used the icc's 15-degree bending rule while throwing the ball to his advantage
 wo kehete hai ki niyam bananaa unka kaam nahin, lekin agar niyam he to is behad pratiyogi samay main uskaa istemaal apane haq main kyon naa karun? But former Indian off-spinner Sarandeep Singh of the Indian team says that Ashwin should be careful
 kyonki niyamon kaa faaydaa to uthaaya ja saktaa he
 But once the off-spinner gets hit, the bowler can use it equally
 aise main niyamon se aage jane kii galati bhi ho sakati he
 According to Section 3 of Rule 24 of the ICC, when the ball reaches the shoulder while placing the ball, the hand should not bend more than 15 degrees from the elbow joint while throwing the ball from there
 haalanki shuruyaat main ye niyam tej gendbaazon ke liye 10 degree, medium pesars ke liye 7
 5 degrees and up to 5 degrees for spinners but later the spinners were allowed to bend elbows by 15 degrees
 chennai ke aswin un gendbaazon main se aate hai jinka bowling ection clin yani saafe suthra mana jaataa he
 But they are also taking advantage of the current rule to be up to 15 degrees
 aswin un khilaadiyon ke liye sahanubhuti rakhte hai jo aisi galatiyaan karte hai or jinpar pratibandh laga diya jaataa he
 They feel that if a player becomes an off-spinner after training and he is sentenced to sudden punishment then he feels very sad
 aswin apane or harbhajan singh ke sambandhon kii atakalbaazi ko lekar behad dukhi hai
 Ashwin, who has taken 124 wickets in 25 Tests and 139 wickets in 99 odis, says that Harbhajan Singh used to be his role model
 28 saal ke aswin bataate hai ki pehle wo nai gend se madhyam tej gendbaazi karte the or opening ballebaazi karte the
 But after the injury, he adopted spin bowling
 wo 2001 main (tab aswin 14 saal ke the) bhajji ke karnaamon ko yaad karte hai or kehete hai ki turbanetor kii world champion australia ke kilaaf karnaamon kii vajah se wo of spin kii kala ke kaayal ho gaye

 Amma got less seats than in 2011, but the victory was easy and complete and this is the first time since MGR that the people of Tamil Nadu have re-elected the former Chief Minister

 Apparently, Stalin's father felt bad and he also accused Jayalalitha of deliberately insulting him
 shapath kii aupchaarikta puri hone ke saath hi jayalalita sidhe kaam main jute gayi
 And signed five important files

" kendriya urja rajya mantri piyush goyal bijli kii kami ke liye diemke or eiediemke, donon ko hi uttaradaayi tehraate hai
 In Jayalalithaa's words, Tamil Nadu is a "state with excess electricity"
 mumkin he kisi samay yah baat sahi rahi ho, lekin aaj kii hakeekat kuch or he
 Today, power cuts of many hours occur in a large part of the state, the negative impact on the industries is quite fatal

 The results of the Tamil Nadu assembly elections have been decisive in terms of the number of seats, but in terms of the number of votes, there is only one percent difference between the AIADMK and its rival party
 pichley chunaavon main diemke kaa patta saaf ho gaya tha, lekin is baar vah majboot vipaksh banaki ubhara he
 No government in Tamil Nadu has faced such strong opposition, both in terms of numbers and political experience

 Turning the data in his favor, Jayalalithaa won 37 out of 39 Lok Sabha seats in favor of AIADMK in the 2014 general elections
 us jeet ne unka aatmavishvaas majboot kiya
 a former AIADMK minister, on the condition of not disclosing his name, says, "whatever happens in AIADMK is because of Amma's will
" ham unheen ke naam par jitate yaa haarate hai
 "however, he does not miss out on his readiness to say that it is not just a jolly good: Jayalalithaa has a well-planned strategy"
 ’ masalan mahilaon se kiya gaya ammaa kaa vaada kaaphi kargar sabit hua, jaise sona, dopahiyaa vaahan par chhot or maatrutiv main madad aadi
 In areas where women voters outnumbered men, the AIADMK vote grew by 62 percent
 lekin gavarnence or chunavi ranneeti main kaaphi fark he
 The "vision 2023" document outlines jobs, infrastructure, industries and development
 yah ek mahatvakankshi document he
 Before the 2019 general elections, there should be some concrete work and results to show in Jayalalitha's hand to increase her political stature and importance at the national level
 jo bhi ho, ab gend unke paale main he
 What she will do now will decide whether she will be able to go beyond Karunanidhi and MGR as a leader

 unhone kaha ki jis gathbandhan kii raily main bharat mata kii jai kaa jayakaara na lagata ho, vande maataram ke naare nahin lagate hon, wo desh kaa kya bhala karenge? Due to his controversial words, Bihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi is becoming the cause of difficulties for his party
 pradesh ke saat kendriya mantriyon ko rajya main pravesh na dene ko lekar maanjhi ke vivaadit bayaan par jediu ‘asahaj’ mahasoos kar rahi he
 The party has asked him to refrain from making such statements

 We do not consider it necessary to discuss outside
 ’party ke kuch netaa chaahate hai ki purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar phir se pradesh kii kaman sanbhaalein
 He said that those who know Nitish know that power fascination does not matter to him
 samooche desh main bijepi kii jeet hui lekin naitik jimmedaari lekar unhone mukhyamantri pad chod diya
 Nitish ji has said that he will take responsibility only when the public wants

 'unhone kaha, 'main vibhinn samudaayon ke paas janaa pasand karata hum
 An ordinary Indian farmer has more knowledge than any agricultural expert

 The level of debate in Parliament dropped
 The Congress President, referring to a room in the British Parliament, said that a gentleman in the British Parliament showed a room from which India was once run

 He said, 'we are defending against the attack on the Indian Constitution
 main or puraa vipaksh is baat par sahamat he ki hamaari pehali praathamikta jehar ko failaane se rokna he
 On the declining level of debate in Parliament, he said that the quality of debate in the Parliament was high in the 50s and 60s, but if you look at the level of debate in the Indian Parliament today, its quality has declined
 aisa isliye he kyonki saansadon ke paas kanoon banane kii shakti nahin he

 logon ko sambodhit karte hue rahul gandhi ne kaha kipiem modike liedoklam vivadek event he
 Gandhi said that Doklam is not a separate issue
 yah ek ke baad ek kai ghatnaon kaa hissaa tha
 It was a process
 pradhanmantri modi doklam ko mahaj ek event ke rup main dekhte hai
 If they had carefully watched the whole process, they could have stopped it
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki yah hakeekat he ki doklam main aaj bhi china kii maujuudagi he
 Not a strategy for Pakistan, during this time, Rahul Gandhi also targeted PM Modi on Pakistan
 unhone kaha, 'pakistan ko lekar piem modi ke paas koi gaharaai se sochi-samajhi ranneeti nahin he
 It is very difficult to negotiate with Pakistan, because there is no such institution that is supreme
 ham tab tak pratiksha karenge, jab tak ki wo koi susangat dhaancha nahin banaate hai
 "RTI Law created to reduce the problems of the people," said Rahul Gandhi, "india has been going through a phase of change for the last 70 years

 We are changing peacefully
 mahatvapurn siddhant ye tha ki badlaav kaa phayda sabhi bharatiyon ko mili or koi bhi peeche na chute
 Another theory was that it should be broadly according to different people
 bhojan, kaam or soochna kaa adhikaar ye sara dhaancha badlaav ke dauraan logon ko hone vaali pareshaaniyon ko kam karne ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 'the power of power has been reduced in PMO, during this time, Rahul Gandhi also accused PM Modi of centralization of power
 unhone kaha ki bharat tabhi safal hua, jab satta vikendrikrut hui
 In the last four years, there has been a massive centralization of power
 aaj satta kii puri takat piemo ke paas kendrit ho gai he
 He said that a similar change is happening in China
 hamaari prakriya moolbhoot he, jabaki chini paddati thodi hinsak he
 China is moving forward and that progress is also being affected in the world
 bharat santulan kii bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he or puri duniya ko surakshit jagah banane ke liye kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he
 'india specializes in reducing conflict: Rahul Gandhi: Congress President Rahul Gandhi said,' India is expert in reducing conflict
 bharat kaa buniyadi siddhant he ki jab koi puche ki bharat kaa jhukaav 'baayen he yaa daaen', to hamaara jawaab hoga 'bharat sidhe khadaa he
 Gandhi said, "one of my main complaints about the current government in India is that i don't see any coherent strategy based on India's strength
" mujhe keval taatkaalik pratikriyaayein dikhti hai
 Although we have a traditional history with China, as far as the democratic structure is concerned, we are much closer to European countries
 'rahul bole- RSS kaa faisla tha notebandirahul gandhi ne aresas par bhi hamalaa bolaa he
 He described the demonetization decision as the decision of the RSS
 unhone kaha, 'agar aap apane desh ke dhaanche ko gaharaai se samajhate hai, to aap santulit takat kaa istemaal karenge
 Today i do not see India increasing its strength
 notebandi kaa vichaar vittamantri or arabiai ko nazarandaz karke sidhe aresas se aayaa or pradhanmantri ke dimag main baitha diya gaya
 'india's nature is busy changing RSS: Congress President Rahul Gandhi has launched a big attack on Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) from Rahul Gandhi
 unhone aresas par bharat kii prakruti ko badalane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He said, 'today the RSS is trying to change the nature of India
 anya partiyon ne bharat kii sansthaaon par kabja karne ke liye kabhi hamalaa nahin kiya
 The rss's thinking is similar to the Muslim Brotherhood of Arab countries
 'gandhi ne kaha, 'saal 1947 main pashchim ko bharat par bharosa nahin tha, lekin bharat ne pashchim ko galat sabit kar diya
 We got success because thousands of people built institutions and these are the institutions which are under attack today
 'videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj par bhi rahul kaa tanjavideshi dharti se rahul gandhi ne videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj par bhi tanj ksaa he
 He said that the Foreign Minister of India spends a lot of time in making visas and gives less time for the rest of the work
 unhone suzav dete hue kaha ki videsh mantralay kaa ekadhikaar mitaakar or samaaj ke anya hisson ke liye ise or adhik sulabh banaakar ek aadhunik videsh mantralay banaaya ja saktaa he

 unhone kaha ki eemyu prashasan ne campus main shanti banaae rakhane ke liye kisi bhi tarah kaa juluus nikaalane se pehle isaki ijaajat lenaa jaruri kar diya he
 In the notice issued to Ajay, AMU proctor Professor Mohsin Khan has said that the procession was taken out when the students were studying in the classes

 On Friday, Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia joined the padyatra in Old Delhi, protesting the central government's decision to discontinue big notes
 jahaan manish sisodiya ne chandani chowk main chote bade vyapaariyon se mulaakaat kar notebandi se ho rahi pareshaaniyon ko poocha
 During the padyatra, Sisodiyak has been talking to many shopkeepers, Sisodia said that shopkeepers used to earn 7 to 8 thousand in a day, now which has come down to 80% after the note is closed
 treders ne mandi kii vajah bazaar main 100 rupye ke note kam hona bataaya
 During this time, Sisodia discussed with the traders about the raids on the shops
 'aaj tak' se baatcheet karte huemanish sisodiyane kaha ki modi ji blike mani rokane kii baat karte hai lekin note band karne kaa faisla hi ek bahut bada scam he, 500 or 1000 rupye ke note band karne ke naam par aam janata ko pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he
 The Modi government should take this decision back
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle press conferes kar mukhyamantri kejariwal bhi modi sarkaar ke is faisle kaa virodh kar chuke he
 Security of Aadhaar data is a topic that has been under question since its inception
 ab aadhaar data phir se ek baar khabaron main he
 Because an investigation lasting three months claimed that there is a software patch that puts the security of the store data in the Aadhaar identitydatabase at risk
 'hafpost india' kii report main bataaya gaya he ki ek ptch, jise unic aaidentification othority of india (UIDAI) dwaara develop nahin kiya gaya he, isaki madad se kathith taur par havers aadhikarik aadhaar enrolment software ke security feechar ko band kar anaadhikrut aadhaar number jenerate kar rahe hai
 On Tuesday, amid reports of a breach in the Aadhaar database, the Congress said that the details of the people registered in the UIDAI are in danger
 report ke anusaar, koi bhi anaadhikrut vyakti 2,500 rupee main aasaani se milane vaale is ptch ke jariye duniya bhar main kahin bhi aadhaar ID bana saktaa he
 After the report, the Congress said in a tweet, "the security of the Aadhaar database may be jeopardized due to the hacking of the Aadhaar enrollment software
 hamen ummid he ki adhikari bhavi namakanon ko surakshit karne or sandigdh namakan kii pushti ke liye uchit kadam uthaaenge
 Last month, French security expert Elliot Alderson questioned UIDAI as to why uidai's helpline number was registered on the phone of many people without their knowledge
 is par kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 Now he has once again said that UIDAI should work with hackers to stop the data breach
 unhone kaha, 'main doharaata hum ki koi bhi cheez aisi nahin he, jise hack na kiya ja sake
 This also applies on the basis
 kabhi bhi bahut der nahin hoti
 Listen and talk to hackers instead of threatening them
 'UIDAI ne kaha report bebuniyadavahin, UIDAI ne ek bayaan jari karte hue aadhaar sofware hack ho jane kii khabar ko bebuniyaad kaha he
 Some people are deliberately trying to create confusion in the minds of people
 UIDAI ne kaha he ki kisi bhi data ko discs main seve karne se pehle jaruri suraksha upayon ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he
 UIDAI further clarified that no operator can create or update Aadhaar
 jab tak koi nivasee swayan apni bieometric detail use naa de de
 The institution has denied the report's claim completely wrong, stating that anyone can enter the Aadhaar database and create multiple Aadhaar cards
 UIDAI ne ye bhi kaha he ki unke dwaara system main samyaanusaar nae security fitures ko joda jaataa he
 So that any new danger can be avoided
 (input-ieenes) Thank you guys for extending your support and for those who did not like the tweet, well, what can i say? Will keep it 'classy' next time India should do away with the sedition law, it’s archaic and misused

 The collision which started from Greater Noida has reached Agra
 zamin adhigrahan kaa virodh kar rahe kisaanon or police ke bich hui golibari main ab tak chaar jaane ja chuki hai
 Two farmers have been killed in this, while two police personnel have also died
 greater noida se uth rahi hinsa kii lapaton ne bahut jald agra kaa rukh kar liya
 Tension is prevalent in many other areas of Uttar Pradesh
 yamuna express-ve ke virodh main kisaanon ne nijee builder ke daphtar main aag laga di or police par patharav kiya
 The atmosphere of Chaugan village of Agra is extremely terrible
 yahaan jameen adhigrahan ke khilaaf kisaanon ne ravivaar ko yamuna express-ve ke daftar main aag laga di
 After this, the fire of violence erupted when the police and CRPF personnel started fleeing from the spot
 darasal agra ke chaugaan gaanv main yamuna express-ve project kii team maukey par pahunchi thi
 Areas were being evacuated to build roads and ransacked on the spot, but this provoked the anger of the villagers
 gaanv ke log lathi lekar police ko dauda rahe the
 Some people were hitting the policemen with sticks, while some people were throwing stones
 kisaanon ke hamale main kuch pulicekarmi ghayal ho gaye, lekin is afratfari main jo bhaag nahin sakaa, use gaanvvaalon ne bandhak bana liya
 Hundreds of farmers of Agra had attacked first and set fire to the office of the company building Yamuna Expressway and on seeing it
 jenerator dhu-dhu kar jalane lage
 Tents and buildings and furniture were gutted
 baad main police ne puure ilaake ko chhavnee main tabdeel kar diya or aropiyon kii giraftaar ke liye search oparation shuru kar diya gaya
 Meanwhile, Greater Noida has been converted into a cantonment by the police
 bhatta parsul main sannata pasra hua he or police ne ab tak 22 kisaanon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Bhatta Parsaul village in Greater Noida is mourning all around and everyone is moaning from the rampant persecution of the khaki uniforms
 yahaan shanivaar ko police or ardhsainik balon ne milakar jo nanga naach khelaa tha, uske baad saare mard gaanv chhodkar bhaag khadey hue hai
 He is the only one left in the village who is injured and is suffering from pain, while the robbery in his home on the words of women and the lathi sticks on children is a never ending story
 hinsak jhadap ke duusare din police ke jawan gaanv main aropiyon kii talash main nikle or logon ke kheton main aag lagaate chale gaye
 The villagers say that the policemen did not even see that they are harming the accused or the common people
 aag lagane se rokane ke liye jo bhi saamne aayaa, use buree tarah peeta gaya
 Even the elders of the village are in a panic, who in their life have never seen such oppression and the face of the police
 bujurg bhi apane halaat par ro rahe hai
 Three roadways employees were taken hostage by the villagers on Saturday seeking compensation
 iske baad jila prashasan kareeb do hajaar piesi javaanon ke saath greater noida pahunchaa, lekin javaanon kii itani badi taadaad dekhakar kisaanon kaa gussa foot padaa

 C
 mehta ne supreme court ko haal hi main taj mahal ke bare main jo jaankariyaan deen, ve chintaa main daalane vaali hai- taj ko bachaane ke liye ham agar gambhir na hue to ho saktaa he ki jald hi yah khandhar main tabdeel ho jaae
 Cracks have started appearing in the building
 minaaren jhukne lagi hai
 Stones and other things fall frequently from the walls
 pani or hawa main behisaab jehar ghul gaya he jiskaa nateeja he ki sangemarmar kii safedi ab halke pile se lekar bhure rang tak main tabdeel ho rahi he
 Illegal encroachment in the vicinity is very high, cctvs do not work and all the drains around the Taj have been blocked
 or taj kii dekhbhaal karti ai yamuna mar rahi he jisase makbare kii buniyaad par gambhirat khatra mandara rahaa he
 Millions of insects originating in the dirt of the river go to the building in lakhs and are making it dirty
 aisa lagata he maano pathar par likhi sadabahaar ghazal ab bimariyon kaa ghar ban gai he
 "you can close the crown
" aap chahen to ise dhwast bhi kar sakate hai
 If you want, you can also remove it
 '' mehta kii arji par sunwaayee karte hue taj mahal ko lekar supreme court kii bench kii yah hatashapurna tippanee 'duniya ke is mahaan aashcharya' kii durdasha or uske sangrakshan ko lekar laaparvaahee kii sari kahani kah detii he
 Other famous monuments of the world have also faced such challenges related to conservation
 shahar kii sadakon par daudti gadiyon ke dhuen se rome sthit colocium par bhi kaalikh kii ek moti parat chadh gai thi or ise badahaali se ubaarane ke liye teen saal tak jirnoddhar prayaas hue
 Then it has been recently re-arranged
 taj jaisi vishwa dharoharon kii nigaraanee karne vaali sanstha unesco, smarakon kii vartmaan sthiti ko banaae rakhane ke liye, khaastaur se paryatakon kii baari sankhya ke kaaran imaaraton par jo dabaav banataa he uske sahi prabandhan ke liye, ek ekikrut prabandhan yojana kii sifarish karti he jiskaa uchit tareeke se kriyanvayan hona chahie
 However, the problem of Taj is more than just ignoring it
 ham paryaavaran or apni viraasat kii hifaazat ko lekar kis kadar berukhi rakhte hai, yah uski kahani bhi he
 The Taj says that we do not even have the right ability to earn money using our immense possibilities of tourism
 bharat main pichley saal ek karod sailaani aae the
 Singapore, which does not even have a building capable of fighting the Taj far and wide, visited 17 lakh tourists
 is vishesh ank main kaaryakari sampadak damayanti datta dwaara taiyaar aavaran katha'taj ko bachaana he'main yah rekhaankit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he ki khastahal kachra prabandhan, pradooshan, keet-patangon or paryatakon kii betahasha bheed, vishwa ke is mahaan aashcharya ke liye kaise vidambnaaon kaa sabab ban chuki he or iskaa astitv khatre main he
 It is a sad story of mistakes, sleepiness, neglect, mismanagement crimes, short-sightedness and plain negligence
 yah vah smarak he jiske saath duniya, bharat ko jodakar dekhati he
 Often when you tell someone that you are from India, they automatically speak - where the 'taj Mahal' is
 taj 370 varshon tak bharat ke kai shaskaon, prakritik aapadaaon or yudhon ko safaltaapurvak jhel gaya
 How can we leave 'this great wonder of the world' to be destroyed just as other monuments of India are being destroyed? i have seen the Taj dozens of times and each time it amazes me
 ham us peedi ke log nahin ban sakate jo is mahaan smarak kii sundarataa ko yun hi nasht ho jane denge
 From this week, India Today Group will launch the # savethetaj campaign on all its platforms
 har hafte, ham isse judi ek badi samasya ko sabake saamne rakhenge
 i urge all of you to join this campaign
 ham is shandaar imaarat kii hifaazat kaise kar sakate hai, is par apane vichaar hamen bhejein
 This is a wonderful detector that we must protect
 agar ham aisa nahin karte, to yah duniya hamen maaf nahin karegi

 There has been a lot of research on this
 yadi sharaab kaa seven band ho jaae, to balaatkaar ke maamalon main ahm kami hogi
 Agnivesh said that many crimes and accidents are caused by drinking alcohol
 shaakaahaar ke mahatv ke bare main agnivesh ne kaha ki japani vaigyanikon ne haal main dharti ke sabase bujurg vyakti par ek adhyayan kiya or unhone paaya ki vah shaakaahaari tha
 He said, 'every research in this world suggests that goat meat (red meat) is the root of all diseases
 ’agnivesh ne kaha ki pichley saal 16 disambar kii raat dilli main chalati bas main ek ladki se barbar samuhik dushakarm ke sabhi 6 aaropee sharaab pie hue the or yahaan tak ki haal hi main 5 varshiya bacchee se balaatkaar karne ke aropiyon ne bhi sharaab pi rakhi thi
 He said, 'in both cases, the accused had drunk alcohol
 isse spasht hota he ki sharaab kii vajah se unhone aparaadh kiya
 Alcohol overcomes man's moral thinking
 ’agnivesh ne kaha, ‘sarkaar sharaab utpaadan band nahin kar rahi kyonki isse revenue praapt hota he
 In all the states, the race to overtake each other in terms of alcohol production has started
 yah ek chalan ban gaya he
 Expressing concern over the fact that one billion animals are slaughtered every day, he said, 'this will have serious consequences
 ’yah puche jane par ki kya mrityudand se balaatkaar kii ghatnaayen rukengi, agnivesh ne kaha, ‘mrityudand se kuch nahin hoga
 i do not support it
 maut kii sajaa kisi ko nahin di jaani chahie, yahaan tak ki sansad par hamalaa karne waalon ko bhi

 a view of this was also seen on the Rajpath today when the President was offering gallantry honors to the wives of these brave martyrs, neither there was much applause nor patriotic slogans were raised in his name
 haa, iske sthaan par modi or obama ke naam par naare jarur lage
 People welcomed both of them with tremendous enthusiasm

 aaie ab jaanate hai ki wo koun vir sapoot hai jinhone hamaare or aapke liye apni jaan kii kubarni di
 The first thing was of the hero Neeraj Kumar Singh
 baat pichley saal agast kii he
 In the jungles of Kupwara, the hero Neeraj's companion came under tremendous fire from the terrorists
 apni jaan kii parvaah na karte hue nayak niraj ne apane saathi ko bachaaya
 a terrorist threw a grenade at Neeraj and started firing heavily
 niraj ne adbhut saahas dikhaate hue aatanki ke kareeb jaakar use goli maar di
 At the same time, another terrorist attacked him, causing his rifle to fall to the ground and shot in the chest
 buree tarah se ghayal hone ke baavjood adamya saahas kaa parichay dete hue unhone us aatanki ko daboch liya or uske hathiyaar chin liye or antat use maar daalaa
 Until he was conscious, he was not ready to leave the field
 behosh ho jane par unhen vahaan se nikaala gaya, lekin tab tak unki jaan ja chuki thi
 Naik Neeraj has two sons
 unki patni padmeshwari devi apane pati ko yaad karte vakt ro padin or kahati hai, mujhe khushi he ye award mila, lekin agar wo hote to or acha lagata
 Padmeshwari Devi also says that children understand that the father is on duty

 At the same time, Major Mukund Varadarajan got news on April 25 last year in Shopian, Kashmir that three terrorists were hiding in a village

 kamare main chhipe aatanki ko grenade se maar giraaya
 At that time, the companions of the terrorists started firing heavily on them
 buree tarah se ghayal hone ke baavjood duusare aatanki ko maar giraaya
 By the time Major Mukund was taken out, he was seriously martyred due to injuries
 major mukunda kii patni indu kahati hai ki acha to lag rahaa he, par dukh bhi he
 It would have been better if you had received this during his stay
 chaar saal kii beti to samajhati he ki papa bhagwaan ke paas chale gaye hai
 If she grows up, she will send it in the army or wherever she wants
 maatr 31 saal kii umr main desh ke liye ladate hue major mukunda apni ne qurbaani de di
 Today Indu says that all i hope from the countrymen is that they remember the martyrdom of Mukund
 unhen bhoolanaa nahin chahie
 Try this, at least people should be martyred
 wo ye bhi kahati hai ki abhi bhi desh main deshbhakti bachi hui he
 From the newspaper to the television, a small news will be published on these martyrs, but compared to the other news of the parade, the news will be buried in some corner
 vaise na to major mukunda or na hi nayak niraj kii patni is baat shikaayat desh se karengi ki aakhir kyon ye desh sapooton kii qurbaaniyon ko vaisaa yaad nahin rakhata jitna rakhana chahie
 But don't we make any duty unki kubarniyon ko aise hi jaaya hone den

 The shocking thing is that neither Balwinder, the accused who bought the revolver nor the gun dealer, informed the administration of the arms purchase

 The icing on the cake is Dimple Kapadia, whose character seems pretty blatant
 kaha ja rahaa he ki film ke sabhi sitare ekadam nae andaaj main dikhenge
 Earlier, the looks of Deepika Padukone and Arjun Kapoor were also released
 film kii kahani kuch aise alag-alag logon kii he jo kuch hatakar hai or jab ve ek mishan par jate hai to kamedi kaa dhamal shuru ho jaataa he

 bihar kaa tejabacand aaj bhi log bhuule nahin hai
 After this sensational scandal, the name of Bihar's Bahubali Mafia and leader Shahabuddin came into the limelight
 yahi wo maamla he jisaki vajah se shahabuddin ko jail janaa padaa tha
 And Shahabuddinco was released on bail due to no witnesses in the same case, but the Supreme Court canceled his bail
 shahabuddin ke charchaaon main aane se ek baar phir se yah maamla logon ko us khaufnak vaardaat kii yaad dilaa rahaa he, jise tejabacand ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This was broken in the year 2004 in a family rage
 bihar ke sivaan jile main chandreshwar prasad urf chanda babu apni patni, beti or chaar beton ke saath rahaa karte the
 He had two shops in the main market
 ek kiraane kii or duusari parchun kii
 His son Satish used to sit at one shop, Girish at another
 16 agast, 2004 kaa din is parivaar ke liye qayaamat banakar aayaa
 Some people were demanding extortion from Chanda Babu
 magar unhone dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 The same people visited his grocery store that day
 dukaan par unka betaa satish baitha
 They asked Satish for two lakh rupees for extortion
 satish ne 30-40 hajaar rupee dene kii baat kahi
 There were more people who came to collect extortion
 unke haathon main hathiyaar the
 They started fighting with Satish
 galle main rakhi do lakh se zyada kii rakam bhi nikaal lee
 Satish's elder brother also came there
 wo bhi sab dekh rahaa tha
 After being beaten, Satish went to the house
 or bathroom saaf karne vaala tejaab ek mag main daalkar laayaa
 He threw all the acid on the miscreants who came to collect extortion
 tejaab ke chhiten uske bhai rajeev par bhi pade
 After this there was a stampede
 do bhaiyon ko nahalaaya tha tejaab sedukan par badmaashon ne satish ko pakad liya
 His brother Rajiv ran away and hid somewhere
 phir uski dukaan ko lutaa gaya
 After that the shop was set on fire
 badmaash satish ko ek gaadi main daalkar apane saath le gaye
 Girish, sitting at another shop, had no idea about this
 kuch der baad uske paas bhi hathiyaarband badmaash pahunche or use bhi vahaan se agava kar liya gaya
 After this, Rajiv, the elder brother of Satish and Girish, had also gone to the hands of those miscreants
 rangadari na dene kii vajah se unki donon dukaane lut lee gayi
 Then the three brothers were taken to a place
 jahaan rajeev ko rassi se baandh diya gaya
 After that, a bucket full of acid was poured over Satish and Girish publicly
 bade bhai kii ankhon ke saamne satish or girish ko tejaab se jalaakar maar daalaa gaya
 After this, the bodies of both of them were torn to pieces and thrown into sacks
 vaardaat ke din patna main the chanda baboojis din ye sansanikhed vaardaat anjaam di gai, us din satish or girish ke pita chanda babu apane bhai ke paas patna gaye hue the
 The news of the incident spread like fire across Siwan
 kisi ne patna main chanda babu ko phone karke kaha ki vah sivaan nahin aaen
 You will be killed if you come
 unhen bataaya gaya ki unke do bete maare ja chuke hai, jabaki ek betaa kaid main he
 Rajiv was imprisoned by miscreants there
 magar do dinon baad vah bhaagane main kaamyaab ho gaya
 He somehow hid in a tractor laden with sugarcane and reached Chanpur
 vahaan se wo uttar pradesh ke padrauna ja pahunchaa
 There he took refuge in the house of a local MP
 is dauraan chanda babu kii patni, donon betiyaan or ek apahiz betaa bhi ghar chhodkar ja chuke the
 The whole family was shattered
 is dauraan chanda babu ko khabar mili ki unka teesraa betaa bhi maaraa gaya he
 There was a conspiracy to kill Chanda Babu
 During this whole incident, one day someone called Chanda Babu and informed that your son has fallen from the roof
 magar is soochna ke peeche asli makasad unhen bulaakar khatm karnaa tha
 This was a conspiracy by the miscreants for this
 baavjood iske chanda babu himmat jutakar sivaan pahunch gaye
 He tried to meet the Superintendent of Police there but he was not allowed to meet the SP
 thane pahunche to vahaan daaroga ne kaha ki aap fouran sivaan chhod dijie
 After that Chanda Babu went to a big leader in Patna with the MP of Chhapra
 magar netaa ne yah kahkar pallaa jhaad liya ki maamla sivaan kaa he, to vah kuch nahin kar sakate
 During this time, the miscreants got the news of meeting Chanda Babu's leader
 unhone chanda babu ke patna vaale bhai ko phone karke dhamkee de daali
 He was so frightened by the threat that he immediately left Chanda Babu and immediately transferred himself from Patna to Mumbai
 vahaan jane ke baad bhi unako dhamkee bhare phone kiye gaye jisaki vajah se unhen dil kaa daura padaa or unki maut ho gai
 The district police did not help, after this Chanda Babu started living in Patna
 vah puri tarah se besudh the
 His condition was like that of a monk
 vah kai dinon tak idhar se udhar ghoomte rahe
 Later an MLA gave him asylum
 isi bich chanda babu ko pataa chalaa ki unka betaa rajeev abhi jinda he
 This news added a new energy to him
 iske baad patna main hi chanda babu kisi tarah se ek baar phir sonpur ke ek bade netaa se mili
 And pleaded for protection from them
 netaa ne madad kaa aashwaasan diya or bihar ke dijipi narayan mishra ko nirdesh diya
 The DGP wrote a letter to the IG
 aiji ne diaiji ko or phir diaiji ne espi ko patr likhaa
 But nothing happened
 chanda babu niraash hokar dilli chale gaye
 He met Rahul Gandhi there
 magar keval aashwaasan mila
 Daring Chanda Babu again came to Siwan
 espi ke paas jane kaa man banaaya
 But none of his relatives or friends agreed to go with him
 jab kuch nahin hua to chanda babu akele hi ek subah espi se milane unke ghar ja pahunche
 SP jointly appealed for security
 diaiji kii chitthee bhi espi ko di
 But the SP also asked Chanda Babu to leave Siwan
 rajeev kii saream hatyaniraash hokar chanda babu phir se diaiji e
 K
 beg se milane pahunch gaye
 The DIG reprimanded the SP after listening to him and asked for immediate protection
 uske baad chanda babu ko suraksha mil gai
 Then he started living in Siwan
 isi bich ek din unka betaa rajeev laut aayaa
 Chanda Babu's wife, daughters and disabled brothers also returned with him
 kuch dinon baad rajeev kii shaadi ho gai
 But the difficulties were not over yet
 shaadi ke 18wein din hi 16 june, 2014 ko rajeev kii saream goli markar hatya kar di gai
 Rajiv was the lone eyewitness to the murder of his brothers
 is babat rajeev pehle bhi court main bayaan de chukaa tha
 Even then he was threatened with death
 shahabuddin kii giraftaar2004 main tejaab cond ke naam se mashhoor sansanikhej hatya cond main shahabuddin ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 302 ke tahat maamla darj kar liya gaya tha
 But the arrest was not made
 magar varsh 2005 main bihar kaa nizaam badla
 Nitish Kumar's government came
 or shahabuddin par shikanja kas gaya
 The same year Shahabuddin was arrested from Delhi
 tabhi se shahabuddin ko kadi nigaraanee ke bich jail main rakhaa gaya
 They were heard in the court only through video conferencing
 shahabuddin ko nichali adaalat ne is bich kai maamalon main sajaa sunai
 There were 39 murder and kidnapping cases against him
 38 main unhen jamaanat mil chuki thi
 The 39th case was of Rajiv
 jo apane do sage bhaiyon kii hatya kaa chashmaddid gavaah tha
 But with his murder in 2014, the way of Shahabuddin's bail was cleared
 or aakhirkaar 11 saal baad shahabuddin jamaanat par baahar aa gaye
 But his exit created a stir in the state's politics
 ab ek baar phir is maamle main sabaki nigahen nitish kumaar kii taraf lagi hai

 a class 9 student studying in a government school in Jahangirpuri area of the capital Delhi fell down from the third floor

 Where his condition remains critical
 vah philhal coma main he or jindagi-maut ke bich jhul rahi he
 Please tell that this incident of the government school is on 27 April

 He told that on April 27, the family received a call from the government school in Jahangirpuri, Delhi that the condition of your girl child is very bad and come to the hospital
 parivaar ke log jab aspataal pahunche to wo hairaan rah gaye
 His daughter Saffron, studying in 9th grade, was lying on a stretcher in critical condition
 parijanon kaa aarope he ki skool prashasan ne unase baat chhupaai
 Why was not captured in CCTV, the family members say, it is not that Saffron has been under stress regarding studies
 parijanon ke mutabik vah class main hameshaa awwal aati he, parivaar waalon ne usko mili certificate bhi dikhaae
 The family alleges that the school administration is hiding this incident, because when cctvs are installed in the entire school, then why was the incident not captured in CCTV
 skool prashasan ne sadhi chuppivahin duusari taraf is puri ghatana par schoolprashasan kii ore sekhoi safai nahin ai
 From the Vice Principal to the SMC member, no one is avoiding speaking on the incident
 haalanki skool ke teachers ne khud baari-baari se kuch ghante ke liye aspataal main parivaar kii madad ke liye samay dene kii baat kahi lekin somvaar ko koi bhi aspataal main najar nahin aayaa
 The family is demanding an unbiased investigation into the whole incident

 in dinon dilli sarkaar ke doctoron kii riatarment age ko lekar asamanjas kii haalat bani hui he
 The central government has increased the retirement age of doctors from 60 years to 65 years, but the Delhi government is still not able to take any decision on this
 is bich kuch doctoron ne ritairement kii umr ke kanfusion ko lekar adaalat kaa darwaja bhi khatkhataya he
 Doctors who have reached the age of retirement are waiting for when the Delhi government issues a notification to increase the retirement age of doctors
 kareeb 2 maheene biit jane ke baavjood dilli sarkaar ne ab tak doctoron kii ritairement age ko 65 saal karne ke centre sarkaar ke faisle ko dilli main lagu nahin kiya he
 Dr
 SB Srivastava of the Department of Dermotology at Rohini Kebaba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital is one of such doctors
 30 june ko doctor shrivastav ritair ho rahe the lekin dilli sarkaar ke doctoron ke ritairement age par kendra kaa notification nahin lagu karne par doctor shrivastav ko court kaa ruukh karnaa padaa
 According to Dr
 Ajay Luthra, Advocate of Dr
 Srivastava, the order of the Center is applicable in Delhi, according to the rules of Delhi Health Service Allopathy, the order of the Central Government comes into force in Delhi, but Dr
 SB Srivastava had to go to the court because the new Delhi Government Retirement Age Not notifying the order philhal dow shrivastav ko ste mil gaya he
 But this is an immediate relief
 dow shrivastav kii hi tarah jo doctor ritairement age ke kareeb pahunch rahe hai, unki chintaa badhati ja rahi he
 Retirement age of doctors is only 62 in Delhi
 In fact, the retirement age of doctors in Delhi has remained 62 so far, whereas according to the rules of Delhi Health Service Allopathy, the rules of the Central Government remain in force in Delhi
 yani niyam to lagu ho gaya lekin jab tak dilli sarkaar ise notiphoi nahin karegaa tab tak kagaji karrwai or vetanman ko lekar kanfusion kaa daur bana rahegaa
 Hospitals have not yet received orders to increase the age of the Delhi government, so now the doctors who are on retirement age have to follow the rules, this question is bothering the doctors day and night
 aspataalon kaa HR bhi he kanfuhospatalon kaa echaar vibhaag bhi ye tay nahin kar paa rahaa ki doctoron ke aage ke vetan banenge yaa nahin
 According to BJP MLA Vijender Gupta, the Kejriwal government is not serious about health services
 is mudde par ajtak ne dilli sarkaar ke swasthya mantri satyendra jain se bhi baat kii
 According to the Health Minister, 'the retirement age of the people of the central government who are working with us has increased
 ' swasthya mantri kaa jabaav sarkaar ke dhulmul ravaiye kii ore ishaara kar rahaa he
 However, the motive behind not issuing notifications is political or something else, but the Minister knows that, but the Government of Delhi government is not worried about not releasing the notifications, which are retiring this month

 apni sthapana ke baad pehali baar party loksabhaa chunaav main khaataa kholane main bhi vifal rahi
 Lalu's special leaders are seen in the background
 aise halaat main lalu ke khaas maane jane vaale shivanand tiwari ne bhi party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh pad se kinaaraa kar liya he
 The manner in which Shivanand Tiwari took leave as the party's national vice-president by issuing a statement, it seems clear that his attachment to RJD has been dissolved due to neglect
 unhone apane bayaan main likhaa he ki thakaan kaa anubhav kar rahaa hum
 There is more fatigue of mind than body
 tiwari yaheen nahin ruke
 He further wrote that he wanted to write memoirs
 vah bhi nahin kar paa rahaa hum
 So i want to take a break from what i am doing
 shivanand tiwari ne pad chhodane kaa bataaya yah kaaranshivanand tiwari ne likhaa he ki sansmaran likhane kaa prayaas karuunga
 i will not write, i do not have such faith, but i will try
 isliye argedy kii ore se jis bhoomika kaa nirvahan ab tak main kar rahaa tha, usase chuttee le rahaa hum
 However, it is clear from this statement that he has not broken ties with RJD, but has only taken leave of his responsibility in the party
 lekin itnaa tay mana ja rahaa he ki argedy main apni upeksha se shivanand tiwari kaaphi dukhi hai or ek tarah se party ko unhone yah sandesh de diya he ki agar unki upeksha jari rahi to vah party bhi chhod sakate hai
 The leaders changed, the party changed but the leaders did not change
 The leader of a strong socialist background, Shivananda Tiwarijis, stayed with the party, with whom he remained with full loyalty
 chaahe vah lalu prasad yadav hon yaa phir nitish kumaar, party ke saath-saath unke tark badalte rahe, lekin nishtha nahin
 Tiwari is counted among such leaders, who cannot tolerate their own neglect
 jediu se rajyasabha saansad rahete hue rajgir main party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main gathbandhan sahyogi bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii ore se narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane par shivanand tiwari kaa bolnaa party ke netaaon ko raas nahin aayaa tha
 As a result, the Rajya Sabha ticket was cut and the party issued a decree to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Buxar
 shivanand tiwari neraajnneeti se sanyasalene kii baat kah di, lekin argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ne unhen na sirf apni party main bulaayaa, balki rashtriya upaadhyaksh bhi banaaya
 Strongly keep his talk till Shivanand Tiwari was in JDU, till then RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav was on his target
 jaise hi vah phir se argedy main waapas laute, unke nishane paranitish kumara gaye
 Despite being the petitioner in the fodder scam case, when the RJD president was convicted in the same case, Tiwari openly opposed him
 bhale hi iske liye unhen agade-pichde kii raajnneeti main hi kyon na janaa padaa ho, yahi unki visheshta bhi he
 He puts his point firmly
 lalu kaal main thi kaaphi poochargedy ke mukhiya lalu prasad yadav jab tak jail nahin gaye the, tab tak shivanand tiwari kii party main jabardast puch thi
 Read-write leaders are therefore more important to the RJD
 haalanki, lalu ke jail jane ke baad jab party kii kaman unke chote betetejasvi yadavake haath main ai, tab anya varisht netaaon kii tarah vah bhi upeksha ke shikaar ho gaye
 Whether the policies of the party are determined, the matter of taking a stand on a subject, Tejashwi preferred the opinion of new people in running the party rather than taking the opinion of experienced leaders and this did not appeal to Shivanand Tiwari
 karte rahe party kaa bachaav, di naseehat bhivarisht netaaon kii upeksha ke baavjood tiwari argedy kaa bachaav karte rahe, lekin party kaa bhavishya unhen bhaybheet bhi karata rahaa
 Perhaps this is the reason that many times he has invited Nitish Kumar again to become the leader of the Maha coalition and also praised him fiercely
 loksabhaa chunaavamein haar ke baad jab tejasvi yadav party kii baithkon se, party ke kaaryakramon se dur the or vah kahaan hai, kisi ko yah bhi jaankaree nahin thi, tab tiwari ne unhen naseehat bhi di
 At a time when the head of the party is in jail, everything is not going well in the Lalu family, it is a big shock for a veteran leader like Tiwari to step away from the organizational responsibilities of the party

 The US Attorney General said that Andrew mccabe, the former deputy director of the country's intelligence agency FBI, has been dismissed from office two days before his scheduled retirement date
 meccabe raashtrapati donald trump ke gusse or aalochana kaa niyamit rup se saamana kar rahe the
