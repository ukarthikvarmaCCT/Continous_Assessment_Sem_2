 View this post on instagrama post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor)ondec 31, 2018 at 2:14pm PST In the city of Mirpur Mathelo in Sindh province of Pakistan, a Hindu girl named Anila Bagri was sold by a police employee to her friend
 ghotki jile ke mirpur mathelo police stesan ke head clerk ne apane dost jafar musuri ke saath 50 hajaar pakistani rupee main ladki kaa sauda kiya
 Three days later Mussoorie forcibly converted the girl into a marriage
 'aaj tak' ke paas he nikaahnaame kii copijankaree ke mutabik musuri ne jo nikaahnamaa banwaaya he vah avaidh he
 There is no witness on her and that girl Anila Bagri has now become Shaima Mussoorie
 us nikaahnamaa kii copy 'aaj tak / india today' ke paas he
 Anila Bagri was abducted
 baad main police ne use baraamad kiya tha
 After coming to the news of this matter in the local media, Ghoti's SSP Masood Bangesh has suspended the head clerk Sajjad Qazi till the investigation is completed
 'aaj tak' team ne esaspi bangesh se sampark karne kii koshish kii, lekin vah uplabdh nahin hue
 Hindus have no human rights in Pakistan
 The local Hindu youth Rajkumar while talking to Aaj Tak said that it is routine in Pakistan to marry, rape, gang rape or forcefully convert a Hindu girl
 saal 1947 se yahaan yahi hota aa rahaa he
 The thinking here is that Hindus should be expelled and Pakistan should be made an Islamic country only
 anila bagri kaa maamla isi kaa hissaa he
 The family of many victims is in the shadow of fear, Meerpur Mathelo of Pakistan is the same area where the case of forced conversion of Hindu girl Rinkal Kumari to Islam for a few years ago was covered in the media of Pakistan as well as the world
 abhi kuch din pehle hi vahaan satish kumaar naam ke hindu ladke kii goli markar hatya kar di gai thi
 The parents of Anila Bagri have alleged that the head clerk of Mirpur Mathelo police also demanded Rs 50,000 from them for giving up their daughter
 iske virodh main sthaneey logon ne sadak par utarkar pradarshan bhi kiya
 People demanded Zafar Mussoorie to get his daughter back
 is maamle par 'aaj tak' ne jab ek enjio or pakistan ke patrakaron ke madhyam se ladki ke mata-pita se sampark karne koshish kii to unhone phone or camera par aane se manaa kar diya
 According to the NGO, the girl's family is so scared that they do not want to speak anything
 is ghatana se puure mirpur mathelo main tanaav bana hua he
 Hindu organizations said- The government does not take action
 Ravi Dawani, general secretary of the Pakistan Hindu Panchayat, said that Hindu girls have been converted for a long time in Pakistan
 aise kai vaake hai
 Belongs to Wrinkle, to Anjali, to Shobha
 unhone kaha ki masalaa naamon kaa nahin he, masalaa yah he ki isko hal kaise kiya jaae
 We have requested the police and the government but we are unable to get support
 davani ne kaha ki aise or kai maamle saamne aa rahe hai
 It has seen a conspiracy to harass the Hindu community and be expelled from here
 lekin humlog yahi rahenge
 We request the government to protect our children, our family
 saansad bhi bole- mirpur mathelo main kya nahin hota he?sattarudh party piemail navaj ke empi dow
 Ramesh Vankwani said that forcibly converting girls in this way is against humanity
 is par control hona chahie
 i am tired of saying, but nothing happens
 yah sab ko pataa he ki mirpur mathelo main kya hota he
 There girls are converted to religion and sold for 50 thousand rupees or one lakh rupees
 aaj hi maine ek aise hi maamle main hai court kii madad se ek ladki ko chhudaaya he
 It is common in Pakistan to persecute women, it is also common in Pakistan to commit crimes against women
 aise hi ek maamle main sex racket ke cese main pakadi gai ek mahila ko ek police vaale ne police stesan main hi maarna shuru kar diya
 Also abused a lot of abuse
 pakistan main hindu or ladki hona khatarnakapakistan main hindu hona or us par hindu ladki hona kitna bada khatra he, ye kisi se chipa nahin he
 Talking to a private channel, senior Pakistani journalist Najam Sethi had told that if the mullahs just go, then these animals should also convert to Islam
 inaki kattarta kii vajah se hi pakistan puri duniya main badnaam ho rahaa he
 The symbol of terror is 'symbol of Terror Mian Mittu', this time also in the case of Anila Bagri, people like 'symbol of Terror Mian Mittu' are again being fingered
 pakistan main hindu ladakiyon kaa jabardastee dharm parivartan karvaa rahe hai
 Its reality has been brought before the public and media world
 pakistan main ubaal par he alpsankhyakon kaa gussapakistan kii gali-gali or shahar-shahar main in dinon hinduon kaa gussa ubaal par he
 The focal point of this anger is Pir Abdul Haq, a former MP of the Pakistan Peoples Party
 jinhen pakistan main miyaan mitthu ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is believed that these Mian Mittu have taken up the contract of conversion of Hindus in Pakistan
 miyaan mitthu ko hinduon or khaskarhindu ladakiyon kaa aparankarwakar unka jabardastee dharm parivartan karwaane main maharath hasil he
 There are 117 cases registered against him
 abhi 11 agast ko pakistan main alpsankhyak diwas manaaya gaya
 So in every city of Pakistan, the Hindu population had taken to the streets and demonstrated and also raised their voice against the excesses happening on their own
 tab hindu aabaadi kaa dard foot padaa tha
 Media Voice - Girl will not get justice Asad Chandio, deputy editor of Awami Awaaz told that it is common in Sindh province to force Hindu girls to get married by changing religion
 pehle yah kaam pir miyaan miththu jaise log karte the or ab yah kaam yahaan kii pulisavaale bhi kar rahe hai
 Hindu girls are being sold for 50-50 thousand rupees
 main jaanata hum ki us ladki ko insaaf nahin milegaa
 The role of the police on the case of Anila Bagri is questionable
 yahaan kaa nizaam bhi aisa he kii vah unhen hi madad karte hai jo hindu ladakiyon ko agava karte hai
 Forcibly get married

 13 april 1947 ko rus (tatkaaleen soviet sangh) or bharat ne aadhikarik taur par dilli or moscow main mishan sthapit karne kaa faisla liya tha
 This sequence of friendship started between the two countries continues even after 70 years

 Russia's help did not allow the resolution against India to pass
 isse pehle saal 1961 main bhi rus ne 99wein vito kaa istemaal bhi bharat ke liye kiya tha
 This time Russia's veto was in India's favor on the Goa issue
 iske alaava pehle bhi rus pakistan ke khilaaf or bharat ke paksh main apane vito kaa istemaal karata rahaa he
 Russia has often accompanied India in developmental activities ranging from nuclear and space programs

 The Mumbai Police's preparedness to deal with terrorists during the 26 / 11 attacks in Mumbai was half-complete
 ye kahana he enesji ke purv pramukh or mumbai hamalon ke dauraan aatankwaadiyon se nipatane vaali enesji team ke commander je ke dutt kaa
 According to Dutt, the Mumbai Police had to keep the terrorists entangled until the NSG arrived, but the Mumbai Police had no plan to deal with the terrorists
 dutt ke mutabik enesji ke aane tak mumbai police ko aatankwaadiyon kii lokation or taadaad ke bare main pukhta jaankaree honi chahie thi, lekin enesji jab maukey par pahunchi, to unhen isaki koi jaankaree nahin thi ki taj ke bheetar kya chal rahaa he
 Also, nothing was disclosed about the number of terrorists and their positions
 enesji kii team ke saath jo plan discus kiya gaya usamen kuch bhi pukhta nahin tha, jisaki vajah se oparation main zyada vakt laga
 According to the former DG of NSG, the Mumbai Police also had a severe shortage of counter terrorism equipment and anti-terrorism weapons

 In his petition, Chaudhary has claimed that Trinamool Congress workers are resorting to violence to terrorize opposition candidates in panchayat elections
 (input bhashaa se) When the controversy arose after slipping the tongue in the general assembly, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh has given clarification on his statement of 'tonch goods'
 digvijay singh ne kaha, 'mere kehane kaa arth tha shuddh khara sona
 i was praising Meenakshi Natarajanji '
 digvijay singh ne maamle par safai dete hue kaha, 'maine channelon par apana bayaan dekha he, use galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya he
 i will take legal action against those who are trying to discredit me
 'gauratlab he ki ek jansabha main digvijay singh kii jubaan aisi fisali ki unhone apni hi party kii mahila saansad par aapattijanak tippanee kar daali
 Actually, the case is of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh where while addressing a public meeting, he commented on the area's MP Meenakshi Natarajan for 100 tonne goods
 mandsaur kii ek aamasabha main digvijay singh ne apane aap ko raajnneeti kaa purana johari bataate hue kaha, 'mujhe pataa he ki koun farji he or koun sahi he
 The MP of this region is Meenakshi Natarajan hundred tonch goods
 ' bhaashan ke media main aate hi vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 Significantly, Meenakshi Natarajan, MP from Mandsaur parliamentary constituency, is considered very close to Rahul Gandhi
 digvijay singh kaa bayaan saamne aate hi congress ke andar khalabali much gai
 The party distanced itself from this statement of Digvijay Singh
 vahiin, bayaan par bijepi ne hallaa bolaa diya
 The party said that even better cannot be expected from Congress leaders
 party ne digvijay singh ko maansik taur par biimaar bataaya he
 BJP leader Minakshi Lekhi said, 'digvijay Singh is mentally ill
 abhadra bhashaa main baat karne kaa copirite unheen ke paas he
 Now the country also does not take Digvijay Singh seriously
 ' There has been a stir in Maharashtra Congress and Sharad Pawar's NCP ever since the successive defeats in elections and several strong leaders joining BJP or Shiv Sena
 aise main ensipi ke congress main vilay kii baaten jor pakad rahi hai
 It is being argued in favor that NCP was formed out of Congress only due to Sonia Gandhi being of foreign origin
 iske alaava donon kii vichaardhaara or taur- tareeke main ratti bhar bhi fark nahin he
 Both also run governments at the Center and the state
 vahiin sonia gandhi kaa videshi mul kaa mudda bhi khatm ho gaya he
 At the same time, both parties had equal strength in Maharashtra, then merger was not possible
 donon dalon ke netaaon or kaaryakartaaon kii lambii fehrist ko ek dal main laana khaasaa mushkil tha, lekin ab donon kamazor hai
 In such a situation, there is a discussion that before the Maharashtra assembly elections to be held this year, if the two fight together, it will be better
 congress ko mil jayega vipaksh ke netaa kaa padfaisla to congress or ensipi ke alaakaman karenge, lekin donon dalon ke netaaon main charchaa joro par he ki ab ensipi kaa congress main vilay ho janaa chahie
 The leaders who suggested this merger are in both the parties but without speaking to the high command, they are avoiding speaking openly
 party ke netaaon ne andarkhaane prastaav bhi taiyaar kiya he, jiske tahat vilay hone par ensipi supremeo sharad pavaar ko rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa kaa pad de diya jaae
 This will give Pawar edge to opposition unity
 vahiin loksabhaa main ensipi ke 5 saansadon ke vilay se congress sadasyon kii sankhya bhi badhkar 57 ho jaaegi or usko vipaksh ke netaa kaa pad bhi mil jayega, jis par rahul khud kabiz hokar modi sarkaar se muqabla kar sakate hai
 NCP will get benefits at the Center, in fact, in view of the growing age of Sharad Pawar, NCP has no face of national level in future
 pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar rajya kii raajnneeti se baahar nahin nikle or na nikalnaa chaahate hai
 At the same time, Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule has not been able to make the same stature as Pawar in the politics of the Center, so if the Congress promises to keep Supriya in good position in the politics of the Center, then it can be done
 haalanki, donon dalon kaa alaakaman chahta he ki ye vilay upar se thopa hua naa dikhe balki, neeche kaaryakartaaon se isaki awaz uthe
 This is the reason that the leaders are refraining from speaking anything on this issue and the high command of both the parties are currently implementing the policy of Look and Wait

 Rajan's statement made the economists of the world sleepless
 jisko lekar IMF ne research paper jari kar rajaan kii bhavishyavaanee ko bhram bataaya
 In this research paper of the IMF, it was clearly stated that only monetary policy with cheap debt alone cannot lead to new financial crisis for the world

 He is also one of the few who have already predicted the global recession of 2008-09
 beete saal 2014 main rajan koduniya kaa sabase behtareen governor kaa awardabhi mil chukaa he
 This time Rajan cautioned that the way central banks are competing to liberalize monetary policy, the possibility of a Great Depression is increasing

 After the Datakam balloon burst in the US, the Federal Reserve had lowered interest rates sharply
 rajan ne bhi mandi ke purv kaha tha ek kaarak bhi bazaar ko asthir bana saktaa he
 Rajan had warned policy makers about the ongoing financial liberalization with high interest rates following a period of low interest rates
 lekin zyaadaatar logon ne unki chetavanee khaarij kar di thi or kuch ne to unke vichaar ko puraatan shrenee kaa bataate hue majaak bhi udaaya tha
 Both authors of the IMF report unanimously agreed with Rajan, with monetary policy as the main role in the 2008–09 global crisis

 Following the Adarsh society scam, the state government has recently given a 2,000 square meter plot in Andheri (mumbai) to BJP MP Hema Malini, removing restrictions on discretionary allocation of plots

 saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne upi-bihar main jabardast soshal ejineering kii thi
 BJP had mobilized non-yadav backward castes in its favor and due to this the party had tremendous success in the Hindi belt
 lekin upachunaavon ke nateezon se aisa lagata he ki bijepi kaa yah sameekaran ab tut rahaa he
 By-elections were held in three Lok Sabha seats in both the states and BJP lost on all three
 indian express kii khabar ke anusaar, saal 2014 ke aam chunaav main bijepi ke netritv vaale endie ne upi-bihar main loksabhaa kii 104 siten hasil kii thim
 The BJP alone won 93 seats in these two states
 endie ne kul 383 siten hasil kii thim or bijepi ko 282 siten mili thim
 One of the major reasons for this victory was that BJP had made a huge vote share in its court by creating a strong equation of non-yadav backward castes
 bijepi ne saadh liya tha is varg koyupi-bihar main yadavon ke ubhaar or satta main rahane ke dauraan kuch logon kii dabangai se in pradeshon kii duusari pichhadi jatiyaan upekshit mahasoos kar rahi thim
 The BJP made a good inroads into this category by loudly shouting slogans like Hindutva, social harmony and nationalism
 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ne upi main apane ek-tihaai ummidavaar gaiyr yadav obisi jatiyon se utaare the
 Similarly, in Bihar too, the BJP made such inroads and after joining Nitish Kumar, it was believed that this equation was further strengthened
 lekin donon rajyon kii teen loksabhaa chunaavon ke nateezon ne yah sanket diya he ki bijepi kaa sameekaran tut rahaa he or use upi main sapa-basapa gathjod se jabardast chot mili he
 On the other hand, Lalu Prasad's Rashtriya Janata Dal has made a good dent in these sections in Bihar
 upi main donon siton gorakhpur (praveen nishad) or phulpur (nagendra patel) ke vijeta gaiyr yadav obisi samudaay se aate hai
 In Phulpur, the Kurmi candidate of the SP has won the bjp's Kurmi candidate
 yah seat obisi bahul maani jaati he
 This is a clear indication that despite having two candidates from the same community, people considered it appropriate to choose the Kurmi candidate of the SP
 isi prakaar gorakhpur main sapa ke vijeta candidet praveen kumaar paramparaagat taur par matsaypalan se jude nishad samudaay se aate hai
 This community lives in large numbers in the villages and towns along the rivers of eastern UP
 mana jaataa he ki gorakhpur sansadeey seat main kareeb 3
 There are 5 lakh Nishad voters
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki saal 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan is samudaay ne bijepi ko vot diya tha
 But this time the Nishad community was not impressed by the call of Yogi Adityanath Hinduism
 yahi nahin bihar main bhi gaiyr yadav obisi voters ne is baar bijepi kaa saath nahin diya
 In this case, he did not get any benefit from JDU, this time the backward castes based party
 arriya main bijepi ke gaiyr yadav obisi nishad samudaay ke ummidavaar pradeep kumaar singh koargedy candidatosarfaraj alam ne haraa diya
 In the midst of the high-voltage drama of Mamata Banerjee vs CBI in West Bengal, the BJP has attacked the Bengal government in a big way and accused Mamta Banerjee of saving the corrupt
 bijepi netaa or kendriya mantriravishankar prasad ne kaha ki supreme court ne maamle kii sibiai jaanch karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 The court had also said that the CBI will also investigate which people are involved in it
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi ne 8 may 2014 ko twit kiya tha ki 20 lakh logon ne chit fund ghotaale main apana paisa ganvaaya, lekin ve aaj kya bol rahe hai or tab kya bol rahe the ye sab dekh rahe hai
 In this case, the petitioners were supporters of the Left and the Congress
 sharada ghotaalaa hamaare satta main aane se pehle kaa he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that in this scam, TMC strongman Madan Mitra was arrested, Sudeep Bandopadhyay was arrested and spent many months in jail
 do empi bhi giraftaar hue
 Despite this, Mamta did not comment
 aakhir police kamishnar rajeev kumaar (rajeev Kumar) main aisi kya baat he ki mamata dharne par baith gayi
 There is such a suspicious situation that it seems that the Rajdar knows a lot and it is necessary to save the Rajdar
 unhonekaha ki tiemasi ke dwaara galatabayani kii ja rahi he
 The CBI had summoned the police commissioner thrice
 jaanch agency ko yah power he ki vah kisi ko poochtacha ke liye bulaae
 Went summons three times but did not appear
 har baar alag-alag bahaanaa banaaya
 When the CBI asked the DGP to help us, the police was told that most of the investigating officers have either retired or posted elsewhere
 iske baad sibiai ne aage kaa byoraa maanga, lekin nahin diya gaya
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that there is another interesting thing in this case
 jab baar-baar pressure padaa to kaha gaya ki ham log ek baithak kar lete hai
 Is this a spectacle? It is being said repeatedly that how the CBI came out without a warrant, but it is not being told why the police commissioner did not appear despite summons for the first three times
 police ko power he ki bina warrant ke giraftaar kar sakati he
 He said that we have a clear allegation that Mamata Banerjee is saving herself and her government to corrupt people so that the scam cannot be investigated
 is baat kii bahut ashanka he ki jab rajeev kumaar esaiti ke pramukh the to badi sankhya main sabooton ko yaa to nasht kiya gaya yaa chhedchhad kii gai
 Prasad said that all the soldiers of the alliance are under investigation
 rahul gandhi bhi bel par hai
 The reality is not hidden from anyone
 hamaara spasht kahana he ki mamata banerjee bengal main bhaajapa kii badhati takat se ghabara gai hai
 There was a tremendous gathering of PM
 hamaare netaaon ko raily ke liye parmishan nahin mil rahi he

 Former Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, who has so far attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is now claiming his claim on a BJP slogan
 somvaar ko sampark yatra ke dauraan nitish kumaar ne 'sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas' naaraa ko apana naaraa bataaya he
 On Facebook, Nitish claimed that even though this is a slogan for the BJP, it is not only his thinking but he has brought it down to the ground and hence he is its real contender

 input:bhashaa In Delhi, a man was beaten to death simply because he prevented some people from urinating in the open

 When it was investigated, two things came out
 pehali vajah: logon kii maansikta badalanaa jaruridarasal iske peeche kii ek badi vajah he logon kii maansikta
 People stop the car at the place where they get urine when they urinate

 Second reason: lack of public toilets in this case can not only blame the mentality of the people but also a major failure of the civic agencies
 dilli main public toilets kii kami he to vahiin duusari taraf zyaadaatar public toilets aise hai jo ki itane gande hai ki log chaahakar bhi unka istemaal nahin kar sakate
 Maintenance of public toilets is also not good
 jiske kaaran unki haalat or kharaab hoti ja rahi he
 For the argument of MCD, Delhi Mayor Preeti Aggarwal says that it is very important to change the mindset of the people
 meyar ne kaha ki yahi dilli he jahaan log dilli metro ko to saaf rakhte hai lekin baahar nikalate hi gandagi failaate hai
 The Mayor said that people have to accept that the whole of Delhi is their home and they have to keep the house clean
 vahiin north emsidi main netaa vipaksh rakesh kumaar kaa kahana he ki north dilli main aabaadi ke hisaab se yadi public toilets kii sankhya dekhi jaae to wo oont ke munh main jire ke samaan he

 itnaa hi nahin congress ke ek purv vidhayak ke khule bayaan ke baad party main sankat or bhi gaharaa gaya he
 Both of these cases are about sabotaging the party with the help of Congress
 unase pataa chalata he ki farvari ke chunaav ke pehle party satta main aane ke liye kis kadar baichaiyn ho gai thi or apane siddhanton ko taak par rakhkar congressi vidhayakon se samjhauta karne or unhen kharidne ko bekaraar thi
 This party became a big platform for people who believed in principles and principles in which people from not only the country but from all corners of the world participated
 kai to aise bhi hai jinhone apni aakarshak naukariyaan taak par rakh deen or siddhanton kii khatir party kaa kaam karne lage
 But now this confusion seems to be breaking
 aapasi kalah or apane ko superior dikhaane kii chahat main kuch netaa dusron ko neeche giraane main lag gaye hai
 The result is in front
 party ke baahar or bheetar koharaam machaa hua he
 Not only the public but committed workers are also asking questions
 udhar ek or sansthaapak anjali damania ne bhi party chhod di he
 He is called Kejriwal of Maharashtra
 vah party main chhide ghamaasan or topi oochhaalane kii ghatnaon se aahat hai
 Apart from them, hundreds of workers are also ready to leave the party
 agar aisa hota he to koi aashcharya nahin ki party mutthi bhar netaaon kaa jamaavada bhar banakar rah jaaegi
 If we look carefully, we will find that the party did all the work which it had accused others
 party ko satta main dobaaraa laane ke liye har tarah ke hatkande apanaae gaye
 She accused BJP of trying to buy mlas, but now it is known that she herself was in the game
 party ke kai sadasyon par aarope laga ki ve votaron ko kharidne kii koshish kar rahe the
 Not only this, the party had also accused the opposition parties of distributing liquor, but a large amount of liquor was recovered from the house of a relative of his own candidate
 marpet kii kuch ghatnaon main bhi uske kaaryakartaaon kaa naam saamne aayaa lekin party un sabakaa aarope badi safai se dusron par madhti rahi
 That is, all the demerits of a common political party started appearing in him
 lekin arvind kejariwal in sab ko badi safai se chhupate rahe
 Now that many cases are coming together, the absence of Arvind Kejriwal is going to knock people especially his supporters
 aisa nahin he ki vah koi bayaan nahin de sakate, lekin vah jaanate hai ki ek chuppi hajaar vaakyon ke baraabar he
 And this is the time that misinformation can be inverted
 aise main chup rahanaa unhen pasand aa rahaa he
 At the moment there is no time to think about the party's image, it is time to think about ourselves

 But the Opposition is yet to see an opinion in this matter
 trinamul congress iske paksh main nahin he
 On the other hand, the Congress may be an attacker on the Modi government regarding PNB, but on this proposal, it will make its final decision just before the second phase of the budget session of Parliament starting on March 5

 anna hajaare ke health chekup main unhen 101 degree bukhaar paaya gaya
 Not only this, Anna's blood pressure was also increased
 haalanki anna kaa bukhaar baad main utar gaya
 The doctors have suggested Anna to postpone the fast one day
 saath hi doctoron ne anna ko sadak yatra na karne kii salaah bhi di
 In lieu of this, doctors recommend that Anna go to Mumbai via air travel

 This person was everywhere in the past year - Narendra Modi is synonymous with 2014
 bandhi hui mutthi or kathith 56 inch ke seene vaala swayambhu modi apane prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan us bharat kaa paribhaashik pratik ban chukaa tha jo thake-haare abhijatyon kii upie naamak mandali se nijaat paane ko baichaiyn tha
 Her roar against the family rich nobles and old ruling elites born with a silver spoon in the mouth was echoing all over the world
 amethi se lekar chennai tak or bastar se lekar kerala tak aakankshaon ke sailaab par savaar jabardast urja se yukt is shaks kii prayek saarvajanik upasthiti puraani satta ko ukhaad phenkane kaa aahvaan thi, jisamen deh se dhul jhadakar khadaa hua ek ‘‘chywala’’ apane maamuli ateet kii shekhi bagharta hua kahana chaah rahaa ho, ‘‘agar main kar saktaa hum to aap kyon nahin!’’ oxford or cambridge se shikshit abhijatyon ke khilaaf jang par niklaa unka yah varg shatru desi kaarobaariyon or puunjipatiyon kaa mitra bhi he
 He is a hero of Hindutva but carries with him state-of-the-art and high-tech media
 vah vaishvikrut bharat kaa ek aisa jan-samarthit pratik he jisaki vijayi nigahen vaidic yug par tiki hui hai
 Of course, the power of this country is coming out of the designer kurta that was once stitched in Gujarat
 beete disambar kii hi ek thandi shaam kaa kissa he jab raashtrapati bhawan ne apane ceremoniyal haul kii nai wing ke udghaatan kaa aayojan rakhaa tha
 All the influential rulers of Lutyen's Delhi were present here: from ministers, governors to army chiefs and the president himself
 ghadi ke kaante jaise hi niyat samay par pahunche, apane trademark chudeedaar-kurte main tahaltey hue pradhanmantri bheetar aae
 The chatter in the room suddenly turned into silence
 vahaan jute viypi is mahanayake kii nigaah main aane ke liye dhakka-mukki karne lage
 There is no doubt that in 2014, Modi has emerged as a huge figure
 sattar ke dashak main indira gandhi ko chhod den to gathbandhan sarkaron ke tale dhai dashak lanbaa daur dekhne ke baad pehali baar bharat apane sabase taqatvar pradhanmantri kaa gavaah bana he jo baari bahumat ke saath aayaa he
 This picture was not always like this
 modi pehali baar megsine ke cover par 2002 main chape the
 He was then called the "master divider", a leader who let horrific communal riots in Gujarat take place under his nose in which more than 1,000 people were killed
 us samay ve samaaj ko teji se baantne vaala banakar ubhare theah apane aalochakon ke liye ve hitler jaise taanashaah the jisane jaan-boojhkar nirdosh musalamaanon kii hatya ko nahin roka tha
 To his supporters, he was the "hindu heart emperor", a hero who protected the majority community after the train burning incident in Godhra in which 56 karsevaks were killed
 congress ke netritv ne unhen ‘‘maut kaa saudagar’’ kaha to unke apane logon ne unhen ‘‘gujarat kaa sher’’ ke tamge se nawaja
 Never before had a person divided public opinion so cleanly
 thodaa or peeche chalem
 It was the 1990s
 modi siyasat kii sidhippon par chadhgaye kii jor-aajamaaish main lage the
 He was never among the next generation leaders of the party within the BJP emerging slowly in the direction of challenging the dominance of the Congress
 tab pramod mahajan kaa daur tha, jo tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke daahine haath or mukhya ranneetikaar hua karte the
 When Sushma Swaraj used to drop electricity in the field of publicity, the command of the ideology was in the efficient hands of Govindacharya
 aise prachaarak ke taur par jisane kabhi koi chunaav nahin ladaa or jiskaa rajkaaj main koi tajurba nahin tha
 Modi lived behind the scenes like any other Sangh pracharak
 haa, kapade us samay bhi unke chakachak hua karte the
 He used to make influential statements on TV as a party spokesperson and showed tremendous organizational skills during the visits of LK Advani and Murali Mohar Joshi
 iske baavjood vaajapeyi-adwani kii jodi ke sambhavit uttaradhikariyon kii agali qatari main ve kabhi bhi nahin rahe
 Yet he had confidence in himself, a determination that he was made only for great works
 saamanytah sangh ke prachaarkon ko sanghathan ke liye sampurna samarpan kii vajah se apni nijee mahatvakankshaon ko dabaanaa-chhipaana hota he lekin modi is maamle main alag the
 Like other campaigners, he did not have a fanciful ideal to spread the message of RSS in the society
 ve isi duniya kii nirmam siyasat kaa anivaary hissaa the or gujarat kaa mukhyamantri banane ko betaab bhi the
 Maybe, he must have had a desire to become Prime Minister someday too
 unke dimag main apane uddeshy ko lekar koi bhram nahin tha-ve bijepi kii tarakkee ke liye samarpit vafaadaar kaaryakarta the, lekin ve bhayankar rup se vyaktivaadee bhi the, jamini siyasat ke aise nishthur khilaadi jise apane siyaasi pratidwandvi ko thikaane lagane main leshmaatr sankoch nahin hota
 The Sangh understood this matter much better than anyone else, who had been raised in the branches of Modi
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi hogi ki vadnagar ke is prachaarak ko uskaa dey lautaane ke maamle main sangh parivaar ke bheetar kinhin maukon par sankoch rahaa hoga
 For example, in 2008, when a group of Modi's supporters appealed to Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat to entrust more responsibilities at the national level to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Bhagwat (who was second in the RSS at the time) responded: We can make him the candidate for the post of Prime Minister, but someday he may not have the desire to become a Sarsanghchalak! "there is always fear and amazement in dealing with Modi
 The has been a mixed expressions and inability to solve this conflict is not so easy
 modi kalt kaa janmahindutv kii vibhaajankaree raajnneeti ke dhwajavahak ke taur par modi ke andhere paksh kaa udghaatan agar 2002 or uske baad kii paristhitiyon ne kiya, to uske baad ke varshon main unki chhavi kaa doosraa pahalu ubhara
 Modi's entry from the hero of Hindutva to the Guru's dress was well-planned and strategic, but behind it was a lot of hard work and an ongoing quest to improve himself
 unhone jab aktubar, 2001 main gujarat ke mukhyamantri kaa pad sambhala, to unhone khud mana tha ki ve kabhi bhi kisi sarkari daftar main tab tak nahin baithe the yaa sarkari filon ko kabhi chuaa tha
 Yes, he definitely had the resolve to succeed
 unhone aise ‘‘karmyogi’’ netaa ke rup main chhavi banaai jo sarkari kaaryakramon ke prabhavi or jamini prabandhan ke liye afasarshahi ke saath milakar kaam kar saktaa thah choubees ghante saaton din bijli, ladakiyon kii shiksha, sinchai yojanaayen ityadi
 Under his leadership, the administration of the state was transformed into a project-enabled machine
 modi ke rajnatik kariyar main vastav main do nirnaayak mode aae
 The first was the burning of the train in Godhra and the subsequent riots, when he refused to apologize or repent for the failure of the state administration and thus created a distinct political identity
 doosraa nirnaayak pal 7 aktubar, 2008 ko aayaa jab tata samooh ne elaan kiya ki vah gujarat ke sanand main naino kaa plant lagayegaa
 The decision to bring the plant from Bengal to Gujarat gave Modi something he could not even win in 2002 or successive elections — credibility as a trusted administrator
 yahi vah mode tha jab modi kii mahatvakankshaon kaa gubbaaraa gujarat kii sarhad ko langhane laga
 The riots had left him politically alone; The trust he got from Tata was also a recognition from a highly respected corporate citizen, which gave him confidence that the wave against him had returned
 phir unhone ek tadak-bhadak se yukt jansampark madhyamon ke sahare khud ko sushasan ke liye katibaddh aise netaa ke taur par prachaarit karwaanaa shuru kiya jise bhrasht nahin kiya ja saktaa or jo ucch vruddhi or thos buniyadi dhaanche vaale ‘‘gujarat model’’ kaa chaalak rahaa he
 This work was done in such a way that Gujarat model and Modi cult become synonymous with each other
 (neuyark ke modison skhwaayar garden par samarthakon ko sambodhit karte modi)sushasan guruyah vahi daur tha jab modi ne paramparaagat ‘‘hindu’’ voter ke daayre se baahar nikalakar apane samarthakon kaa nayaa thikaana khojah ve ab khud ko us samudaay ke nayak ke taur par sthapit karne main jute gaye jise ve ‘‘nayaa madhyavarg’’ kehete hai
 For Modi, this "new middle class" was the Congress' response to the "common man" that had to be at the center of their slogans before the 2014 elections
 modi ne isi aabaadi ko ‘‘ummiido se labarej’’ bharat kaha, vah bharat jo behatar jivan or sampannataa ke liye baichaiyn he
 Ironically, it was this class that had benefited from the great economic liberalization started by narasimhav-manmohan Singh in 1991
 singh ne arthvyavastha ko to badal diya lekin isse paidaa hui rajnatik uthal-puthal ko ve paryaapt samaj nahin paae the
 There is no doubt that the politics that led to the great change in 1991, was imbibed by Modi better than the Congress
 udaarikaran ne aaj yuva bharatiyon kii ek aisi peedi ko janm diya he jinke liye behatar jindagi kii buniyadi kasuti dhanarjan tathaa saamaajik or bhautik tarakkee ban chuke hai
 This mentality is completely different from the generation of his father-grandfathers in the era of license-permit raj, whose ambitions revolved around government jobs and academic qualifications
 teji se badalte or shahrikrut hote bharat main is tabake ke liye modi badi sahajata se ek ummid jagaa rahe the, jaise ‘‘achche din aaenge’’ ke unke chunavi naare main dikhataa he
 Then there is no doubt that in the 2014 elections, the BJP got the most support from the first-time voting youth and "young" India: CSDS study shows that 42% of Indian youth between 18 and 25 years of age give Modi He wanted to see his Prime Minister, while 16 per cent were those who liked Rahul Gandhi
 yah apane aap main zyada dilachasp baat he ki 2014 ke chunaavon main 64 saal kaa ek netaa apane se 20 saal chote mukhya pratidwandvi ke mukaable yuva votaron kii pehali pasand tha
 Modi was constantly in dialogue with the youth and connected with his feelings, whether he was addressing townhall gatherings on college campuses or on social media websites like Twitter and Facebook with the help of his communication team
 rahul ke bare main to bas itnaa hi kaha ja saktaa he ki unhone maukey ganvaane main koi mauka nahin ganvaaya
 He has neither a Facebook account nor a Twitter account
 beshak, apane ‘‘mishan 272’’ project main sahyog karne ke liye modi ko is nae varsh par rahul ko dhanyavad detaa hua ek card bhejnaa chahie, lekin manmohan singh ko to ek shubhakamana card banataa hi he
 Wazir Manmohan Singh, a former prime minister and posted by Sonia Gandhi, was a soft-spoken scholar who was constantly looking at the horizon in his no-holds-barred all-around slogans of accusatory media, demanding citizens and accountability
 apane mantriyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke lagaataar badhate aaropon kii surat main is bhale sardaar ne itani lambii chuppi odh lee ki isse yah chhavi bani goyaa unhone maidan main ghutane tech die hai or vastutah desh main koi pradhanmantri he hi nahin
 Looking at the most populous Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav was still struggling to deal with the complexities of governance and he was a raw player in the field of politics
 maharashtra jaise ek ahm rajya main ajit pavaar kaa ‘‘kisaanon ke baandhon main peshaab karne vaala’’ kukhyat bayaan sattadhari giroh ke naitik divaaliepan kaa pataa de rahaa tha jis par ‘‘neshnal karpt party’’ kaa naam chaspaan kar diya gaya tha
 Mani Shankar Iyer shot a goal in the Congress post with his irresponsible statement on Chaiwalla, due to which the bjp's prime ministerial candidate easily got the chance to rule against his achievements
 The aristocrats born would have been able to reject the section
 ek dhanyavad gyaapan media ko bhi bheja janaa chahie jiskaa ek bada hissaa modi ke khel main chiyarlyder bana hua tha
 Modi is the leader of the TV era: he is a tremendous speaker, his camera love is well known and he immediately knows what will become "news"
 soundbite se gadhi jane vaali samakaleen saarvajanik bahason ke is daur main modi ne media kaa, khaskar tivi kaa jamkar istemaal kiya or khud ko aise shashakt vichaaron se ot-prot netaa ke rup main sthapit kiya jo desh ko gandagi or bhrashtachar se mukti dilaa saktaa tha
 Modi was the reason for TRP for the media and it seemed that this mascot of BJP has captured every movement of our lives
 media chaahe koi bhi ho, us par tasviir modi kii hi rahati thi
 Modi's election campaign was unique in itself: it was such a confluence of media, money and technology that really surprised the opposition
 masalan, modi in 3di ne dikhaaya ki kaise atyaadhunik praudyogiki kaa istemaal modi ke sandesh ko har jagah prasaarit karne main ho saktaa he; missd kol or esemes ne yah sabit kiya ki kaise cellphone kaa istemaal kaaryakartaaon kii fouj taiyaar karne main ho saktaa he; uttar pradesh or bihar ke ‘‘media se dur’’ gaanvon main achaanak pahunche video rath ne shahar or gaanv kii khai ko hi paat daalaa
 And this whole game was not just one man's bus
 iske peeche team modi thi jisamen yuva, technocrates samarthak maujuud the jinaki kaman kahin zyada khantee or chaalaak netaa amit shah ke haathon main thi
 On the other hand, there were those RSS workers who were campaigning from house to house, because this election had become a question of life and death for them in their quest to quench their thirst for power
 sachaai to yah he ki media ne modi lahar ko paidaa nahin kiya
 He was just riding that wave
 yah lahar (jise shah ne tsunami yaa sunamo kaha tha) us siyaasi maahaul kii upaj thi jisamen kharaab growth, mahangaai, baari bhrashtachar aadi ne nakaaratmakataa kaa bodh paidaa kiya tha or yahaan tak ki matadaataaon ke man main noummidi kaa bhav ghar kar chukaa tha
 Voters were looking for such a terminator (superman) like Arnold "warzenegger" who would turn the nation's problems with a magic wand
 (gandhi jayanti par nai dilli main svachh bharat abhiyaan kaa aagaaj karte modi)sab le gai tsunamichunaav ke baad hua ek adhyayan bataata he ki bijepi ko vot dene vaale har chaar main se ek yani 27 fisadi logon kaa kahana tha ki unhone modi ke kaaran vot diya
 In the Congress, the kind of desperation, the BJP had to be in the first place anyway, but it was the Modi factor that got the party so many votes that it crossed the threshold of majority on its own
 ek varisht congressi netaa ne kaha tha, ‘‘yah netaa sahi samay, sahi jagah or sahi pariprekshya main aayaa he
 Narendra Damodardas Modi was sworn in as the 15th Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014
 yah desh main pehali baar ai sthir hindu rashtravaadi sarkaar ke mukhya kaaryakari kii shapath thi
 It was not a coalition government like the Vajpayee-led NDA; NDA-2 was a BJP government where coalition partners, even old allies like Shiv Sena, had to kneel before the BJP leadership
 yah samaaroh apane aap main modi kaa put liye hue tha
 It was traditionally held not outside the Durbar Hall but outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan: the ceremony was being held to mark the arrival of an "outsider" and the proclamation of the New Delhi court
 modi hameshaa se hi behtareen sanyojak rahe haih unka shapath samaaroh bhi suniyojit aayojan tha
 The presence of the leaders of SAARC countries for the first time, including Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was aimed at creating a stir so that the new Prime Minister could be projected as the alleged Mashraq leader
 videsh mantralay ke afasaron ko aakhri pal tak is yojana kii khabar nahin thi
 In pure Modi style, he wanted to shake the entire power establishment once
 unhen apni ‘‘bahari’’ kii chhavi par garv hota he, aisa shaks jo lutiuns kii dilli ke niyamon-kanoonon or aupchaariktaaon kii zanjeeron main bandhane se inkaar karata ho; aisa shaks jo itnaa alag ho ki apane parivaar tak ko shapath samaaroh main aane kaa nyotaa na detaa ho
 In America, he once again played the showman and transformed Madison Square into a festival of diaspora; He even walked to the ongoing concert in Central Park, shoulder to shoulder with Hollywood hero Hugh Jackman and greeted the crowd in an absolutely seventies Star Wars style, "may the force be with you" ( May all of you be with you)
 dangon ke baad america ne kai varsh tak modi ko vija nahin diya to kya, modi bhi thaan baithe the ki vaishvik netaa banane kii raah main ise aade nahin aane dena he
 (modi to children on Independence Day) Clean imagemodi specializes in creating a line of slogans on prime time (eg his anti-corruption slogan Na khoona na mga dena), inspiring himself (sometimes Sardar Patel, sometimes Vivekananda) ) And prefer to throw simple but silent ideas in the market that they believe are gaining popularity The listener

 He promised a new mission to eradicate the Planning Commission and build toilets

 23 months
 13 sau encounter
 60 death
 350 ghayal or 3 hazaar se zyaada giraftaar
 Or say surrender
 ye upi main yogiraj ke dauraan hue encounter kaa wo meter he, jo ye bataa rahaa he ki rajya kii police ne mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke encounter ke hukum ko kitni sandjidagi se liya he
 The operation of the UP Police "thok Do" is so much discussed that now the United Nations Human Rights has also questioned it
 itnaa hi nahin ab to supreme court ne bhi is thany-thany par apni nazaren tedi karte hue upi sarkaar ko notice jari kar yogi sarkaar se jawaab maang liya he
 So now questions are arising whether the encounter in UP was fake? Was the encounter in Yogiraj fake? So were criminals a deliberate target? Why were the slain criminals not arrested? This question has now crossed the border of the state to the threshold of the court
 kyonki jab se upi main yogiraj aayaa he tab se 13 sau se zyaada encounter hue
 59 criminals died
 327 apradhi ghayal hue or 3,124 apradhi yaa to arest hue yaa unhone sarender kar diya
 Perhaps this is why questions are being raised that the criminals who were killed could not be caught alive
 bas yogi kii isi baat ko soobe ke pulisavaalon ne syriasli le liya
 And made such a daily encounter that the opposition had to say that it is not Yogiraj but the encounter raj
 or to or khud united nesan human rhite ne bhi upi main hue encounter par sawaal uthaae
 Therefore, after such allegations, the Supreme Court has now issued a notice to the UP government regarding the encounter
 darasal, adaalat main in encounters par sawaal uthaate hue ek piiel daayar kii gai he
 In which it has been demanded that the police encounters in UP be investigated by the CBI or SIT under the supervision of the court
 lihaaza, piiel par aadesh dete hue mukhya nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi ne kaha- ye ek gambhir maamla he jisamen vistaar se sunwaayee kii aavashyaktaa he
 Now the matter will be heard on February 12
 darasal, upi main in encounter ko lekar virdohi lagaataar sawaal uthaa rahe the ki soobe kii police apane rajnatik aakaa ko khush karne ke liye farji muthbhedon ko anjaam de rahi he
 If criminals had been wiped out in the right way, people in the state would have been living without fear
 to enciarabi ke aankaden bhi upi sarkaar ke daavon kii pole khol rahe hai
 a few days ago some pictures of the UP Police were revealed
 ek sio sahab thane kaa nirikshan karne pahunche to paaya ki pulicekarmiyon ko bandook chalaani nahin aati
 Do not know how to load pistol
 hathiyaaron ke naam to khayr koun yaad rakhe
 i do not remember when the expiry date of bullet and tear gas shells came out
 ab aise main aap upi police se kya ummid karegein? bas itnaa hi kah sakate hai ki sachmuch kamaal he yogi ji kii police
 Now, if you do not mind, then let me also tell you that the Uttar Pradesh Police is opening itself to the pole-bar of so much of the UP Police
 aisa ek baar nahin, baar-baar hua
 The gun did not fire when the opportunity came
 haalanki ye bhi sarkari bandooken hai
 Now the matter of those pictures which came out after different encounters
 he naa kamaal? ek taraf upi kii sarkari bandooken chalati hi nahin thi, or phir achaanak vahi bandooken danaadan goliyaan ugal rahi hai
 Why not grow? When the finger on the trigger is of the Yogi's decree and the government orders the encounter, the bullets will run
 sawaal ye he ki achaanak upi main accounter kii jhadi kyon lag gai? kya whupi main kaanoon vyavastha is kadar charmara gai he ki encounter ke alaava koi rasta hi nahin bachaa? kya upi main criminal is kadar belgaum ho chuke hai ki achaanak puure sosayadi ke liye khatra ban gaye? kya upi kii police is kadar bebas ho gai ki krime par control hi nahin kar paa rahi he? yaa phir sarkaar ne sabase aasaan rasta chun liya he ki krime khatm karnaa he, to criminal ko hi khatm kar do
 But is this path right? Is the encounter the only way and the last weapon to improve up's law and order? If yes, then as long as this encounter continues, why not lock all the courts of UP for the time being? Anyway, justice is now happening on the street instead of the courts
 wo bhi goliyon se
 The use of the word 'encounter', the first encounter of India, started in the twentieth century in India and Pakistan
 encounter kaa sidhaa sidhaa matlab hota he badmaashon ke saath police kii muthbhed
 However, many people also call the encounter as a government killing
 hindustan main pehla encounter 11 janvari 1982 ko mumbai ke wadala college main hua tha, jab mumbai police kii ek special team ne gangster manya surave ko chah goliyaan maari thi
 It is said that after shooting the police, he put him in a car and roamed the streets of Mumbai till he died
 iske baad use aspataal le gai
 This first encounter of independent India was engulfed in controversies
 uttar pradesh main tamaam encounter isliye sawaal khadey karte hai ki inamen se har encounter ailaania kah kar kiya gaya
 According to the sources, the list of criminals declared to the UP STF and all the district police was sent and according to the same list, encounters are going on in UP
 vaise ise pataa nahin ittefaq kahenge yaa kuch or ki pehle khud yogi adityanath ko upi sarkaar or upi police se khud ke liye sangrakshan maangani padi thi
 That too inside the Parliament House
 tab unhone baqayada rote hue kaha tha ki upi sarkaar unhen jhuthe aapraadhik maamalon main fansaa rahi he
 But now the time has changed
 ab vahi yogi upi kii sarkaar ke sardaar hai or upi police unke aadhin
 Now someone else is asking for protection

 AAP leader and MLA Somnath Bharti has a longstanding relationship
 lekin ab unki mushkilen thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 Due to a dispute with his wife, the court on Monday issued a non-bailable warrant against him
 adaalat ne unki agrim jamaanat yachika bhi thukraa di
 Now Bharti has filed an application in the High Court for relief
 darasal, unki pareshaaniyon kaa daur isi saal shuru hua tha
 Take a look at this entire controversy
 june 2015 main saamne aayaa vivadaap netasomnath bharti ne 2010 main lipikamitra se shaadi kii thi
 For a long time, the relationship between husband and wife was not good
 lekin yah maamla isi saal 10 june ko achaanak surkhiyon main aayaa
 On June 10, the news came that the Delhi Women's Commission sent a summons to Somnath Bharti in connection with the violence
 or unhen 26 june tak ayog ke saamne pesh hone ko kaha tha
 On the same day, his wife Lipika lodged a complaint of domestic violence against him at Dwarka North police station
 agast 2015 main patni ne lagaae gambhir aropasomnath bharti ne jab 4 agast ko ek bayaan dekar kaha tha ki agar dilli police ko dilli sarkaar ke adheen kar diya jaae to aadhi raat ko bhi khubasurat auraten surakshit baahar gum sakati hai
 The same day his wife Lipika made a statement that she was normal in appearance, so her husband Somnath treated her badly
 lipika ne kaha tha ki somnath ko sirf sundar ladakiyon kii chintaa he
 i am normal in appearance, probably because he used to treat me badly
 somnath bharti ko unki suraksha kii jaraa bhi chintaa nahin he, jabaki vah sirf sundar ladakiyon kii suraksha ko lekar gambhir hai
 On September 10, Lipika reached the court after making a statement in the court after complaining to the women commission and the police
 10 sitambar ko dwarka thane main darj unki exiaar par karrwai karte hue dwarka court ne lipika mitra ke bayaan darj karaae
 The clerk was produced before the magistrate in Dwarka Court No
515 to give a statement
 police ne bataaya tha ki is maamle main somnath bharti ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 307 / 406 / 420 / 506 / 498A ke tahat dhokhadhadi, hatya ke prayaas, dahej pratadna or gharelu hinsa kaa maamla darj kiya gaya he
 a notice was sent to Somnath for questioning
 11 sitambar ko police ne kii karrwai, ghar par maaraa chhapanotice milane ke baavjood somnath bharti poochtacha ke liye dilli police ke saamne nahin gaye
 The police had sent him two notices
 isliye 11 sitambar ko police kii ek team ne unke ghar par chapa maaraa, lekin wo ghar par nahin mili
 After that, police also raided other locations in search of Bharti
 lekin bharti police ke haath nahin aae
 At the same time, Somnath Bharti said that he did not trust the Delhi Police at all
 ajtak se baatcheet main unhone kaha tha ki ek din pehle exiaar darj hui he, police ko giraftaar kii jaldi kyon he?lipika ne kaha tha- privet part par kute se katwayausi din shaam ko lipika ne ek baar phir se khulaasa karte hue kaha tha ki bharti ne buree tarah se unka shoshan kiya
 Committed violence with them
 lipika ne bataaya tha ki paise maangane par bharti ne mujhe gaaliyaan di
 After that i slapped many and also tried to strangle me
 unhone mujhe dhakka diya yah jaanate hue bhi ki main 7 maheene kii pregnent hum
 He then asked his dog to attack me
 jab kute ne mujhapar atake kiya to vah dekh rahe the
 i was bitten by the dog in many places including the stomach and private parts
 dilli police ke paas bharti ke khilaaf paryaapt sabutapulice ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha tha ki mitra ne jo saboot die hai usamen kute dwaara kaate jane kii pushti hui he
 We have also spoken with Mitra's neighbors who have seen the dog biting incident with their eyes
 unhone bharti ko bhi vahaan khadey dekha tha
 The evidence and facts of the incident are sufficient to prove Somnath Bharti accused
 lipika ne kaha thah do baar kii jaan se maarane kii koshishasomnath bharti kii patni lipika mitra kaa kahana tha ki unke pati ne unhen do baar jaan se maarane kii koshish kii thi
 On Thursday, Lipika had alleged in a statement before the magistrate that Bharti had cut her wrist in front of her children with a sharp object and abused her
 mitra ne bataaya is ghatana se unke bachche agle kai dinon tak khaufjada rahe the
 On September 13, the police sent a second notice
 Delhi Police issued a fresh notice on Saturday, to AAP MLA Somnath Bharti, who was not present for questioning in the case of domestic violence
 dilli ke sanyukt police ayukta deependra pathak ne bataaya tha ki unhone shanivaar ko somnath bharti ko doosraa notice jari kiya he
 This notice was sent to his house in Malviya Nagar
 pathak ne bataaya tha ki pehla notice jari hone ke baad somnath ne police ko aashwaasan diya tha ki vah poochtacha main police kaa sahyog karenge, lekin vah apni baat se mukar gaye
 Non-bailable warrant issued on September 14 a local court in Delhi on Monday issued a non-bailable warrant against Somnath Bharti
 yah karrwai adaalat ne dilli police kii apil ke baad kii
 The police had appealed to the court and said that Somnath Bharti is not cooperating in the investigation
 do baar notice dene ke baavjood vah poochtacha ke liye nahin aae hai
 Therefore warrants are necessary to ensure his arrest
 agrim jamaanat yachika bhi khaarizdilli kii sthaneey adaalat main bharti ne agrim jamaanat ke liye yachika lagaai thi
 But Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Garg refused to grant anticipatory bail in the case
 iske baad bharti kii mushkilen or bad gai
 No relief from High Court, Bharti reached Supreme Court Somnath Bharti had approached the High Court after the non-bailable warrant was issued from the local court and the anticipatory petition was dismissed
 lekin jab vahaan bhi unhen raahat nahin mili to unhone jamaanat ke liye supreme court main arji daakhil kii thi
 Which has been heard but Bharti is not relieved yet

 Somnath, who reached the police station with the book of Indian constitution in his hand, said that he was not running away from the law

 He has surrendered only on the orders of the Supreme Court
 instent miseging ap whatsapp duniya main sabase zyada yuj kiya jane vaala plateform he
 It is particularly popular in India
 kah sakate hai watsap ke liye bharat duniya kaa sabase market he
 There are around 200 million users of whatsapp here

 There are more than 5 billion users
 bharat main ab whatsapp ke liye pement sarvice launch karne kaa rasta ab saaf dikh rahaa he
 For a long time, the company has been testing whatsapp Pay in India, but due to reasons like debt localization, there was not even talk in the ministry
 report ke mutabik watsap data loklijeshan ko lekar sahamat he or ab watsap ko zyada yugers ke saath whatsapp Pay kii testing ke liye hari jhandi mil gai he
 whatsapp Pay will have the largest Rival Paytm in India
 bharat main petm sabase zyada yuj kiya jane vaala digital pement placeform he
 In such a situation, if whatsapp brings a service similar to Paytm, then surely there will be a competition between users in both companies
 petm ke siio or founder vijay shekhar sharma ne whatsapp Pay ko lekar kai baar sawaal uthaae hai
 He said that whatsapp is not a security for payment
 unhone fasebuk par iljaam lagaate hue kaha tha ki bharat main free basic jaise chip tricks fail hone ke baad fasebuk phir se khel main aa gaya he
 Talking about Paytm, according to the report the company has 230 million customers and Paytm is also popular
 dhire dhire petm par kai sarvice aa chuki hai
 In such a situation, it will not be easy for whatsapp to compete with Paytm
 kyonki watsap ek chat besd ap or petm jaisi pement se judi suvidha jaahir he watsap par nahin milengi
 However, experts believe that people will also like whatsapp Pay
 na sirf aam yugers balki chote bijnesaman bhi watsap pement yuj karenge
 Let us tell you that whatsapp business has already come a long time and recently Facebook has announced the option of product catalog on whatsapp itself
 yani chote bijnesaman watsap ke jariye apane products ko cell kar sakate hai
 In such a situation, whatsapp payment can be beneficial in business too
 na sirf petm balki amejon or google pe se bhi whatsapp ko kadi takkar milegi
 Because Google Pay is also continuously increasing its service and Amazon has also introduced UPI Besal Amazon Pay

 India Today's sex survey has been trying to understand the sexual behaviors of Indians for the past 17 years
 lagata he ki maujuuda samay main ham apni naitik varjanaaon ko paar karke apni sex bhaavana ko lekar pehle se kahin adhik khul gaye hai
 Many parts of the country have now gone ahead with sex, because the average age of experiencing sex has decreased for the first time
 udhaaharan ke liye, guwahati main 61 pratishat logon ne kaha ki unhen sex kaa pehla anubhav kishoravastha main hi ho gaya tha
 It was at the forefront of all the cities in the country where surveys were conducted 
 aaj, 33 pratishat logon kaa daawa he ki unhen pehla yon anubhav kishoravastha main hua tha
 This has gone much further since 2003, when our first sex survey was conducted, when only 8 percent of people said they had had their first sex experience before the age of 18
 web se zyada judaav, sex ke maamle main vyapak sweekruti or morning after pil (garbh nirodhak goli) kii suvidha ne shaayad kam umr main sex kaa rasta taiyaar kiya he
 This year, in addition to regular questions assessing changing sexual behavior and attitudes, we asked many new questions to people
 hamane unase sex ko lekar unki fantasy, vafadari or vivahetar yon sambandhon ko lekar soch, pornography or sex kshamta badhaane vaali viagara jaisi dawaaon ke upyog vagairah ke bare main poocha ki ve ise kis prakaar dekhte hai
 More than three-quarters of people surveyed said they regularly or occasionally watch porn — 85 percent of men agreed
 48 fisad purushon ne yah bhi sweekaar kiya ki ve paise chukaakar yon sambandh bana chuke hai, jabaki 3 fisad mahilaon ne bhi aisa karne kii baat sweekaar kii
 Despite this, the majority of people surveyed — 89 percent — were against filming or taking photographs of themselves during sexual activity; 74
 4 fisad log tikdi ke vichaar ke khilaaf the
 It also means that these people were somewhat skeptical about their fantasies or all kinds of experimentation or were not willing to share their most secret fantasies with the surveyors
 isi prakaar, 64
 4 percent did not open the issue of going to a strip club or swinger club with their partners, and 57 percent did not have any S&M act in the name of experimentation (manhood or beatings and sexual pleasure during sexual activity)
 Not open in case of lekin 14-29 aayu varg ke logon se role play, tikdi, sex ke dauraan pitayee yaa apane partner ko kaatane, yaa dildo, wibrator vagairah ke istemaal kii baat poochi gai to nishchit rup se ve adhik udaar the or pratishat antar naganya tha
 In August 2018, the Supreme Court delivered a landmark ruling that the LGBT community has the right to express its sex sentiment openly
 pehali vaishvik vivahetar dating website gliden, jisaki bharat main kareeb 2,00,000 mahila sadsy hai, kii solene pallate ke anusaar, ''website ne pichley chah maheenon ke dauraan samilingi sex main 45 pratishat se adhik kii vruddhi dekhi he, jiskaa arth he ki ipisi kii dhara 377 ke khatm hone ke baad log apni pasand ke yon sambandhon ke liye or apane vivaah ke baahar samalangik yaa ubhayalingi sambandh banane ke liye zyada swatantra mahasoos karte hai
 However, the India Today Sex Survey suggests that most Indians still hesitate to express their sex feelings and prefer the same safe version that does not make them uncomfortable
 yon rujhaanon ke bare main poocha gaya, to 10 main se 9 logon ne kaha ki ve keval vipareet ling ke vyaktiyon ke saath yon sambandh rakhte hai
 Patna is the only city (19 people polled) where 58 percent said that they used to have straight sex ie gay and opposite sex
 samalangikta par apane aitihaasik faisle ke ek maheene baad, sitambar 2018 main, sheersh adaalat ne vyabhichaar se jude ek or aupniveshik yug ke kanoon ko khaarij kar diya or yah faisla diya ki vivahetar yon sambandh ab bharat main aapraadh nahin mana jayega
 Yet, as Palette states, "despite extramarital sex being a crime category, infidelity of a woman still remains a huge social stigma in India
" yahi vajah he ki bevafaayee ke gopneey or aasaani se uplabdh vikalp ke baavjood mahilaayein isse hichakati hai or isiilie dating cites par purushon kii sankhya mahilaon se bahut adhik he
 Most Indian women believe that infidelity is a very bad and punishable act
 ''haalanki pichley dashak main, khaskar shahari bharat main, bhartiya mahilaayein apane pairon par khadi hui hai, vittiya swatantraaa praapt kii he, peshewar rup se pragati kii he, pitrusatta or kuprathaon se ladi hai, nariwad kii ek lahar chali he jo sex ko lekar ek udaar vichaar rakhata he
 Even now, most women are not afraid to take sex pleasure to an equal level, but they are still afraid of what people will say
 pichley saal # mitu abhiyaan kaa bhi kaaphi asar dikhaa he
 It made headlines and our sex survey also focused on exploitation and sex at the workplace
 pichley dashak main mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh bade hai
 According to the most recent National Crime Records Bureau data, crimes against women increased by 26 percent in 2016
 natijatan, hamane antat: pehali baar sarkaar kii ore se jari yon aparaadhiyon kaa ek rashtriya register dekha, jo mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadhon ko rokane kaa ek prayaas he
 Social media apps are also making the web a dirty and unsolicited place where child sexual exploiters have easy access, and there is increasing cyber-blackmailing, sex-related extortion and vengeful nudity
 haalanki bharat sarkaar pramukh porn citon ko roak rahi he, lekin 'chaaya citen' bijli kii gati se banati ja rahi hai
 The dark, vicious side of the Internet remains a blind well that is largely unbridled
 sibar suraksha visheshgy ritesh bhaatia ke anusaar, ''soshal netwarking cites, dating portels or smartphone ap bade paimaane par sextorshan or sibar stocking jaise aparaadhon main yogadan karte hai
 Lack of awareness among people about the dangerous effects of smartphone applications and technology-based things is one of the most prominent reasons why people become victims of cybercrimes
 ''porn kii lat se aparaadh main vruddhi to hoti hi he, isse yon asuraksha bhi paidaa ho rahi he or rishton main kadavaahat aa rahi he
 Saadia Salid, founder and chief psychologist of Mumbai-based Inner Space Counseling, says, "today the addiction to porn has spread
 porn adhik dekhne se asaliyat vikrut ho sakati he
 People feel that it is easier to get pleasure through it than the hassle of actually having sex after a tired day
 log turant santushti chaahate hai or porn unhen vah detaa he
 "how the Internet has changed sexual behavior," explains Salid, "the Internet creates awareness and one of the biggest changes that we are seeing is that such patients coming from their initiatives today There has been an increase in the number of people who come to us to discuss issues of intimacy
 yah ek bada sanketak he ki 18-20 saal pehle ke mukaable chijen kis teji se badali hai
 Youth between the ages of 22 and 45 are not afraid to ask for help today
 ''haalanki, bhartiya yon paridrishy main jitani chijen badali hai, utani hi jas kii tas bhi hai
 Our survey results show that in elaborate sexual behavior, men remain trapped in the past
 'kya aapke liye comarya behad ahm he? ', jawaab main 53 pratishat logon (purushon or mahilaon donon) ne 'haa' kaha
 In smaller cities like Ahmedabad and Jaipur, this number was much larger at 82 percent and 81 percent respectively
 2004 main isi sawaal ke jawaab main, 72 pratishat purushon ne kaha tha ki ve apane liye kunari dulhanen chahenge
 We are still a country that seems more inclined to favor the older views
 is varsh ke surveykshan main 42 pratishat mahilaon or 38 pratishat purushon ne ise hi apni pasandida sex rujhaan bataaya he
 It has come down only 9 percentage points since 2003
 lekin bharat ke chote shaharon or kasbon main chijen adhik romaanchak hai
 The data collected this year suggest that the people here are more open about their sexual behavior, not against experimentation and have a healthy attitude towards sex
 indore, bhubaneshwar, guwahati or chandigarh ke log udaar yon drushtikon ke maamle main aage hai
 Experts believe this is because these places have lower value judgments and life here is less complicated
 baharhaal, sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki log apane yon jivan se santusht hai yaa nahin? is saal surveykshan main shaamil 62 fisad purushon or 58 fisad mahilaon ne kaha ki haa, ve santusht hai
 It is a different matter that our society lives a deceitful life and people are afraid to weigh themselves on the scale whether they reduce sex or more
 isliye sach kya he or kitna he, yakeenan kaha nahin ja saktaa lekin ham to apni kahani unheen aankadon ke aadhaar par bun sakate hai jo hamen praapt hue hai
 The availability of the Internet has completely changed the Indian sexual landscape
 The percentage of people who claim they watch regular or occasional porn
 The percentage of people who view a sex website as a violation of loyalty to their partner
 Social media app Chance But they also have the danger of sex exploitation and blackmailing, porn addiction is becoming unmatched, This has led to both sex insecurity and tensions in relationships

 agenda ajtak ke manch se kendriya vitt mantri jetali ne kaha ki kya desh ke vyapaaree puraani waite kii vyavastha ko waapas chaahate hai
 Do the businessmen of the country want to see 17 kinds of tax and 17 kinds of inspectors at their doorsteps? jetali ke mutabik gujarat ke vyapaariyon kaa kahana he ki jiesti lagu hone ke baad unki guhaar par kendra sarkaar ne turant sudhaar karne kaa kadam uthaaya he
 Quoting GST, Jaitley said that it could now be included in the list of top 50 countries in the soon to be of doing business
 jetali ne kaha ki mahaj land or power main ham pichde hai or hamen global index main itane neeche rakhaa jaataa he
 In both these directions, the central government is working with priority and these issues are being discussed with the states
 in donon sthitiyon ko jaise hi sudhaar liya jaataa he desh main kaarobaar karnaa behad aasaan ho jayega or is global soochi main top 50 main bharat shumaar hoga
 On the question of inflation after GST, Arun Jaitley said that there is wrong reporting of inflation in the country
 kuch mahangaai jo subjiyon ke kshetra main dikhaai de rahi he vah siginal he
 According to Jaitley, the prices of vegetables increase after the monsoon
 lekin kuch din baad apane aap vah stable ho jate he
 But this time the prices are going up due to the decrease in production, so the government is constantly trying to normalize the situation

 The increasing popularity of Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Yogpeeth products and their challenge has forced many of the country's leading companies to make changes to their products
 ITC ne utaare local productaemasiji company itisi ne bazaar main pehali baar bazaar ke mutabik sthaneey yaa loklijd product bazaar main utaarne shuru kar die hai
 In this episode, ITC on Thursday launched special juices for North India
 punjab da kinnu naam kaa zeus khaastaur par punjab, dilli, chandigarh or uttar bharat kii market ko dhyaan main rakh kar banaaya gaya he
 Patanjali's products have been established in North India
 Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Products also has a good penetration in North India and Patanjali has crossed a turnover of Rs
 5000 crores with a growth rate of more than 50%
 patanjali ke zeus or duusare utpaada uttar bharat main khaase lokapriy hai
 It is obvious that all the companies including ITC are living their life in selling this product in this important market and the market is adopting new ways to increase the share and ITC has played the stakes of localization
 haalanki itisi kii food divijan ke diviginal chif agxcutive ve
 L
 rajesh kehete hai kii company kaa zeus loklijeshan plan kisi se muqabla karne ke liye nahin banaaya gaya he, lekin wo itnaa jarur maanate hai kii company ko pratidwandiyon kii stritegi par najar to rakhni hi padati he kyonki agar market kaa sies na bade to aapkaa market share hi growth kii chaabi ban jaataa he
 Market change needs to be managed Management guru and brand analyst Shiv Kheda also says that India is a big market, where there are growth opportunities for everyone
 lekin badhate bazaar main bhi har company ko apane pratidwandiyon par najar to rakhni padati hi he or uske mutabik apni yojana main badlaav bhi karne padate hai
 If you look at the juice market of the entire country, then the organized juice market is hardly Rs 1200 crore, which is just 25 percent of the entire juice market
 yani 75 fisadi bazaar par ab bhi anorgenised sector or local zeus vendors kaa hi dabadabaa he yani muqabla tagada he to mauka bhi
 As such, Dabur's real and Pepsi hold over 30 percent of the organic juice market
 aise main bache market share ko hathiyaane ko baaki companiyon ko ji jaan lagaani hogi
 In such a situation, ITC cannot deny the tough competition from brands like Patanjali

 On the other hand, China is working on a system which is probably the world's largest identity database
 jisamen china kii puri jansankhya yani 140 karod log cover honge
 This system is being called a kind of social credit system, which will be completed by 2020
 iske tahat sabhi nagarikon ko unke aarthik vyavhaar ke aadhaar par reating di jaaegi
 In which there are some rewards and there are also some punishments
 abhi yah sirf aarthik vyavhaar ke aadhaar par reating kar rahaa he, lekin jald hi iske antargat soshal media par vyavhaar se jude anya factoron ko bhi joda ja saktaa he
 In China, the system has been in operation since 2014, but by 2020 it will cover the entire population
 vahiin kharaab reating waalon ko blaclist bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 What happened so far
 
 
 - abhi tak ke aankadon ko maane to kareeb 9 million (90 lakh) logon ko kharaab reating mili he
 They got these poor ratings based on their court case or default
 kharaab reating waalon ke air tikat lene par pabandi laga di gai he
 Apart from this, about 3 million (30 lakh) people were also banned from taking train tickets on the basis of poor credit performance
 haalanki, abhi ye sirf ek tarah kii shuruyaat hi he
 In China, the way online payment is increasing and v-chat, Alibaba is expanding
 usee kaaran kai karod logon kaa data online uplabdh he or aasaani se credit record trek ho jaataa he
 China's next goal is to bring all citizens under the rating system

 The government says that people will benefit from this system and bank loans will also help a lot in taking house loans

 Apart from this, this system is being upgraded so much that if you break any traffic rules, your credit rating will be affected
