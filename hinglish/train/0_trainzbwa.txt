 jammu-kashmir mechalgaavvaadi netaa masarat aalamki giraftaar ke baad ghati ke halaat bigadate ja rahe hai
 Around 16 people were injured due to mob stone pelting
 hurriyat netaa mirwij umr faruk bhi pradesh sarkaar ke rukh ke khilaaf khadey ho gaye hai
 Around 16 people, including police personnel, were injured in the stone pelting incident during the Tral March led by Mirwaiz
 virodh pradarshan kii aguwai mirwij umr faruk kar rahe the
 The Mirwais were going to Tral in protest against the killing of the youth in the army's operation
 mirwij ke samarthakon ne bhi bharat virdohi naare lagaae
 The police first resorted to lathicharge to prevent stone pelting and released tear gas shells
 darasal, us ghatana ke baad sthaneey logon ne yuvak ko vahaan kaa nivasee bataaya tha, jabaki sena ne use aatanki qaraar diya tha
 Clashes after Jumaz prayers In the old city area of srinagar, clashes broke out between protesters and security forces who were pelted after Jumaz prayers
 purana shahar ilaake main nauhatta sthit jamiya masjid ke baahar jume kii namaaj ke turant baad patharav kar rahe yuvaaon kii suraksha balon se jhadap shuru ho gai
 The protest turned violent as youths pelted stones at security forces
 masarat kii giraftaar par mirwij bhi ublejamiya masjid main jume kii namaaj adaa karaane vaale mirwij umr faruk ne shuukravaar ko algaavvaadi netaa saiyad ali gilaani or masarat alam ko najarband rakhane ke maamle main rajya sarkaar kii aalochana kii
 Mirwaiz Umar demanded his immediate release and said that the state government is not responsible for breaking the law in Kashmir, but separatists
 mirwij ne kaha, 've hamaare saikadon yuvaaon ko bina kisi kaaran ke hiraasat main rakhte hai or phir hamaare upar kanoon todane kaa aarope lagaate hai
 The rule is breaking the state government, not the separatist leader
 ' unhone haalanki shuukravaar ko sabha main namaaj ke baad shantipurna pradarshan karne ke liye kaha tha
 The reason behind the arrest of Masrat or the killing of an alleged innocent in an encounter in Tral, hundreds of youth of the valley again took up stones in their hands
 virodh va siyasat saadhane kaa hathiyaar 'pathar'darasal, kashmir main patharbaji virodh kaa hathiyaar bhi he or raajnneeti saadhane kaa hathiyaar bhi
 In the year 2010, Masarat had prepared an army of stone-pelters
 lagaataar patharbaji ke jariye usne na keval ghati ko hilaa diya tha, balki isi vajah se 100 se zyada logon kii jaan chali gai thi
 When stone was seen in the valley again, the question arose as to how many people are there in the valley? The incidents of stone pelting are not new in the valley
 haalanki is saal patharbaji ke zyada maamle nahin hue, lekin itnaa to kah hi sakate hai ki ghati ke yuvaaon ke virodh kaa sabase pasandida or aajamaaya khel he patharbaji
 Between January 2009 and January 2014, 1733 stone cases were reported in Kashmir
 khud us vakt ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne vidhansabha main mahabuuba mufti ke ek sawaal ke jawaab main bataaya tha:in 1733 maamalon main 737 srinagar main, 256 baraamula main,191 anantnag main, 87 kulgaam main,127 pulavama main, 53 kupwada main, 79 shopiyaan main, 75 gandarbal main or 127 bandipora main darj kiye gaye the
 Around 9200 youths were arrested in these cases
 baad main 1800 yuvaaon ko kshamaadaan dete hue cese khatm kiya gaya
 Actually, the anger of the youth of the valley comes out as stonewalling
 isaki ek vajah yah bhi he ki unhen virodh kaa sahi raajnneetik manch miltaa nahin he
 What is the mindset of stone-pelters
 
 
 vaise uniwarsity of kashmir ke professor rafee bat kii patharbaji par kiye adhyayan ke mutabik:--kareeb 71 fisadi patharbaj tanaav or gusse main patharbaji karte hai
 - Around 17 per cent perform stone throwing for fun
 --kareeb 12 fisadi logon ko patharbaji ke liye pement kiya jaataa he
 In such a situation, the question arises that during the boil in the valley, why are people holding stones in their hands? aise main aapako nae program se khudako apadet rakhana jaruri he taaki aap har company main nae program par behatar kaam karke de saken
 I've never seen anything like this at a film festival

 ubar taxi par pabandi ko lekar sarkaar ke do mantralayon ke matbhed khulkar saamne aa gaye hai
 While the Home Ministry has written a letter to all states asking for a ban on taxi services like Uber, Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has opposed the ban
 gadakari ne aaj kaha ki agar rail yaa bas main rape ho to kya rail or bas seva ko band kar denge
 Transport Minister Gadkari created a new debate by making this statement within 24 hours of the ban on the company after the incident of rape in Uber Taxi
 sawaal uthe ki kya sarkaar ke andar is maamle par punarvichaar chal rahaa he
 But within hours, it became clear that the government was not with Gadkari, when the Home Minister announced in the Rajya Sabha that all states and union territories have been advised to stop operating the web-based taxi service
 Put it rajnath ne ye bhi saaf kar diya ki dilli prashasan ke parivahan vibhaag ne ensiaar kshetra main ubar ke oparations par pratibandh lagi di he
 In fact, Gadkari's statement has increased the difficulties of the government in its struggle to deal with the political impact of the rape incident in Uber taxi
 vipaksh ko sarkaar par hamalaa karne kaa ek nayaa mauka de diya
 The opposition alleges that a contradiction on this issue has come to light in the government by Gadkari's statement
 rajya sabha main bahes ke dauraan congress saansad rajeev shukla ne poocha ki jab sadak parivahan mantri hi pratibandh ke khilaaf hai to phir ubar par roak kyon lagaai gai
 Not only this, Gadkari was left alone among his own people by giving a statement
 kendriya alpsankhyak maamalon kii mantri najma hepatulla ne jor dekar kaha ki company or driver donon par karrwai honi chahie, jabaki purv grih sachiv or bijepi saansad aarake singh ne kaha ki ubar company par aapraadhik maamal darj kar uske khilaaf sakht karrwai kerani chahie, kyonki usne bina jaanch padtaal ke driver ko nokari par rakh liya
 It is also true that a ban is not the only cure

 Maulana Syed Arshad Madni, president of Jamiat ulema-e-hind, has attacked the central government, saying that during the elections it has completely failed to fulfill the promises made by the central government to the people of the country
 apni vifaltaaon ko chhipaane ke liye sufi sammelan yojit kar mul vishyon se dhyaan hataane kaa asafal prayaas kar rahi he
 Madani said that we have no differences with those who organized Sufi Conference
 kyonki hamaara allaah ek, paigambar ek, quran ek, ibaadat ke tareeke ek hai
 In fact, those who do not understand religion protest
 unhone kaha vartmaan sarkaar ke sangrakshan or ucch adhikariyon kii dekharekh main sufi sammelan ke aayojan ko ham khatre kii drushti se dekhte hai
 The Prime Minister gave more than two and a half hours to Vigyan Bhawan, this reinforces this doubt
 moulana madani ne yah bhi kaha ki pradhanmantri ne islam ko shanti or prem kaa dharm kaha he or is baat ko bhi jor dekar kaha ki aatankwaad kaa koi dharm nahin hota or yah ladaai kisi dharm ke viruddh nahin he lekin is prakaar kii baton kaa sachai se koi sambandh nahin he
 He said that as soon as any terrorism incident occurs in the country, the needle of suspicion is not only diverted towards Muslims but arrests are also started
 zabaan se kaha kuch jaataa he kaary iske vipareet hota he
 Madani said that by actually preserving a section, the present government is trying to cover up its failures by creating discord and anarchy in the name of cult within the Muslims
 tippaniyan On the question of 'bharat Mata ki Jai', Maulana Madni said that it is translated into Urdu as 'madar-e-watan Zindabad'

 There is no harm in this
 lekin agar kuch log dil main kuch or rakhte hai yaa use ‘mabood’ samajhakar puja kii baat karte hai to yah jaays nahin
 It is their own matter, we do not worship anyone except Allah
 jamiat ulema-e-hind ke adhyaksh ne kaha ki mul mudda bharat mataaki jai nahin, yah mul mudde se dhyaan hataane or use peeche daalane kii ranneeti he
 The real problem of the country is communalism
 ise samaapt kiya jaae
 Every countryman should have the opportunity to live life in peace, fulfill the promises made for development from the country and ensure justice to all, because without social justice, development would be meaningless
 madani ne kaha ki sufi sammelan yojit karne waalon se hamaara koi matbhed nahin he
 Because our Allah is one, the Prophet one, the Quran one, the ways of worship are one
 vastav main jo log dharm ko nahin samajhate ve virodh karte hai
 He said that we see the organization of Sufi Conference under the patronage of the present government and under the supervision of high officials
 vigyaan bhawan main pradhanmantri ne dhai ghante se adhik samay diya isse is andeh ko bal miltaa he
 Maulana Madani also said that the Prime Minister has called Islam a religion of peace and love and also stressed that there is no religion of terrorism and this fight is not against any religion but the truth of these kinds of things There is no connection
 unhone kaha ki desh main jaise hi koi aatankwaad kii ghatana hoti he, shaq kii sui na keval musalamaanon kii ore mode di jaati he balki giraftaaryaan bhi shuru kar di jaati hai
 Something is said to the tongue, the opposite is done

 The comments ‘bharat mata kii jai’ ke sawaal par moulana madani ne kaha ki iskaa urdu main anuwaad ‘maadar-e-vatan jindabad’ kiya jaataa he
 Muslims also shout slogans of 'madar-e-watan Zindabad' and 'hindustan Zindabad'
 isamen koi harj nahin he
 But if some people keep something else in their heart or consider it as 'mabud' and talk of worship then it is not justified
 yah unka apana maamla he, ham allaah ke sivaa kisi kii ibaadat nahin karte hai
 The President of Jamiat ulema-e-hind said that the original issue is not Bharat Mataaki Jai, it is a strategy to divert attention from the original issue and put it back

 in patrakaron kii report se bhi kai sawaal uthe hai, kya aapke hindi akhbaar ne in sawaalon ko aap tak pahunchaaya he, kya aapako pataa he ki ajay shukla ne teen kishton main report likhi he ki kaise rafaal vimaan kaa sauda pehle ke saude se 40 percent adhik daam par kiya gaya he
 If you do not know this question, then you will not understand the Rafale deal
 iske alaava prashanth bhushan, yashavanth sinha, arun shouri ne court main yachika di he
 Has raised questions
 ye log kai jagahon par press conference bhi karte rahete hai
 Are their questions raised in detail? aapke sawaalon ke jawaab aapako bataa denge ki rafaal saude ko lekar aapke akhbaar ne kitna apadet kiya he
 You can do the same test with channels
 koi ek bulatin chun len or phir uskaa vishleshan kar len
 The Rafale plane has been heard thrice in the Supreme Court
 14 november ko kareeb saadhe teen ghante kii sunwaayee chali
 The bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi is hearing the case
 justise sanjay kishan kaul or justise joseph bhi is bench kaa hissaa hai
 The Deputy Chief of Air Staff also came to present his case in this case, when the court was also pinched that Air Marshals can go now, it is a different type of war room
 air force ke teen bade adhikariyon ne apana paksh rakhaa he
 Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie and Sanjay Singh, Vinit Handa, ML Sharma are the petitioners seeking SIT investigation in the matter
 sarkaar kii taraf se ke ke venugopal jawaab de rahe the
 The government says that it should not be reviewed by the court, but what decision will come after the hearing can be waited
 maamle ko cover karne gaye patrakaron kaa kahana he ki bench kii taraf se sarkaar or yachikakarta donon se mushkil sawaal puche gaye
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava has done continuous reporting
 unheen kii bheji khabar kaa hissaa pesh kar rahaa hum
 The question of Prashant Bhushan was that the agreement between the government of two countries was done so that tender would not be issued
 - sarkaar ne yah nahin bataaya ki agar dasso rafaal nahin de paati he to koun zimmedaar hoga
 - The government did not take the sovereign guarantee from France, proceeded to the inter-governmental Agreement
 - kanoon mantralay ne chintaa jataai thi ki agar vivaad hua to faisla geneva main hoga jo bharat ke liye acha nahin hoga
 On this, the court asked the government whether France had given a guarantee to India? - atarni general ne kaha ki koi samprabhu guarantee nahin he, letters of confort he
 - Chief Justice asked if you have no guarantee? - sarkaar kahati he ki yah samvedansheel maamla he
 There is a matter of security of the country
 iske baad ofaset partner ko lekar bahes chhidi
 You know that Dasso has chosen Anil Ambani's company as its partner as an offset partner
 company ke hisaab se usne ambani sahit tees companiyon ko partner chunaa he
 There is a reference to the question that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited was named for it till a few days before the deal, but after the deal, it is known that Anil Ambani's company has got a place as an offset partner
 rahul gandhi lagaataar aarope laga rahe hai ki anil ambani kii company ko phayda pahunchaaya gaya he
 On the question of the offset partner, the government also cited the conditions of keeping secret
 prashanth bhushan ne sawaal uthaae
 - Prashant Bhushan said that the government says that it does not know about the offset partner which is against the procedure laid down
 - prashanth bhushan ne aarope lagaaya ki ofaset tay karne kii prakriya badal kar back date se lagu kar di gai
 - The Attorney General has said that if there is an agreement of confidentiality, then things have to be kept secret
 - tab justise ke em joseph ne poocha ki agar ofaset partner bhaag gaya tab kya hoga? - Then the government said that the contract conditions also apply to the offset partner
 - prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar kaise kah sakati he ki pataa nahin jabaki prakriya se saaf he ki raksha mantri kii anumati ke bina nahin ho saktaa he
 - The Attorney General says that the deal was signed before the offset partner was decided
 - hamen 36 vimaan fouran chahie thi isliye deal badal di
 It will be known only by the decision of the Supreme Court that the deal was changed for the offset partner or if the aircraft was needed really quickly, the deal was changed for this
 is par yachikakartaon kaa kahana he ki 2019 se 22 ke bich hi vimaan aaenge
 It has been three and a half years since the deal, but not a single aircraft has arrived yet
 25 march 2015 ke press conferes main dasso ke siio ne kaha ki deal jald final hogi
 95% of the deal has been agreed
 takanic transfar ke zarie echeel kai upkaran banayega
 But HAL pulled out of the deal
 kisi se nahin poocha gaya
 The Defense Minister did not even know
 sarkaar jaanati he ki airforce ke liye 36 vimaan kaaphi nahin he to phir 126 se ghataakar 36 kyon kiya gaya
 How did the Prime Minister declare
 deal isliye badali gai kyonki pradhanmantri ambani ko shaamil karnaa chaahate the
 Now we want to show you two videos
 25 march 2015 kaa yani deal hone ke ek maheenaa pehle kaa or 13 november 2018 kaa, donon ek hi shaks kaa he
 Of the CEO of Dasso
 25 march ko yahi shaks echeel kaa naam le rahaa he magar kya eenai kii smita prakaash ko bataa rahaa he ki use tab kya jaankaree thi, usne kyon echeel kaa naam liya tha

 After an outstanding amount of work and some discussion, you can imagine my great satisfaction to hear on one hand from the Indian Air Force chief of staff that he wants a combat proven aircraft which could be the Rafale
 
 
 and on the other hand from HAL chairman that we are in agreement for the responsibilities sharing, considering as well our conformity with the RFP (request for Proposal) in order to be in line with the rules of this competition
 i strongly believe that contract finalisation and signature would come very soon
 " 15 april 2015 ko pradhanmantri modi or purv raashtrapati oland ke bich qaraar hota he
 The ceo's statement is dated 25 March 2015
 qaraar se bees din pehle kaa
 In it you read that they are saying that you can imagine my satisfaction by hearing from the Chairman of HAL
 chairman ne kaha he ki echeel is deal se judi zimmedaariyon ko uthaane ke liye taiyaar he
 Now what they say on November 13 is from Smita Prakash of ANI, read that too
 
 
 "as a supplier we were pushing to try to get the deal
 We were the winner in 2012
 So we really wanted to get the deal
 And the deal was that for 126 aircraft
 So we were still working on that deal with, as i said, HAL and Indian Air Force
 It was true, as i said also, and i believe that the government of India said that it's too long and too difficult, the 126
 So go ahead with 36, supplied by Government of France
 This was exactly what happened in 2015
 " On November 13, we are saying that as a supplier we wanted this deal
 deal 126 vimaanon kii thi
 We were working with HAL and the Indian Air Force
 maine echeel ke bare main kaha tha, yah sach he
 But they are not telling how HAL got out of the deal
 ve yah bhi nahin kah rahe hai ki echeel ke bare main unhone kaha to tha magar jab wo deal se baahar ho gai to sunakar hairaani hui
 His answer does not show much power
 ve echeel kii tarif bhi karte hai lekin jawaab main spashtataa nahin he
 Listen to all their answers yourself and try to understand
 to ofaset partner kaise chunaa gaya, iske chune jane kii kya prakriya thi, kya uskaa paalan hua, phir rafaal bimaan ke daam ko lekar bahes hai
 Ajay Shukla has written a long report of three installments on Rafale prices in Business Standard
 jisamen daawa kiya he ki modi sarkaar ke samay jo qaraar hua he uske anusaar 40 pratishat adhik keemat di ja rahi he
 Let us know that Dasso CEO from ani's Smita Prakash has claimed that the deal is already 9 percent cheaper
 28 agast ko vitt mantri or purv raksha mantri arun jetali blog likhte he ki endie kii deal upie se 9 pratishat sasti he
 Jaitley is talking about 9 percent cheaper deals on basic aircraft
 phir jetali kehete hai ki bharat kii zaruuraton ke mutabik is aircraft ko las kiya jaataa he wo bhi upie kii tulana main 20 pratishat kam he
 The CEO of Dasson has said that the existing aircraft are 9 per cent cheaper but their reply does not indicate whether they are talking about basic aircraft or the price of aircraft equipped with India's needs according to Jaitley
 - sarkaar ne rafaal vimaan kii keemat silband lipaphe main supreme court ko saunpi he
 - Prashant Bhushan argued that price did not threaten national security
 - rafaal vimaan kii sari jaankariyaan saarvajanik hai
 - The price of Rafale aircraft has also been mentioned in Parliament
 - atarni general ne kaha ki sansad main bina hathiyaar va upkaran se las jet kii keemat bataai gai
 - Without the approval of France, you cannot tell the price of a fully finished jet
 vaise 8 march ko india today se france ke raashtrapati maikron ne kaha tha ki modi sarkaar chaahe to rafaal vimaan ke ditels vipaksh se saajha kar sakati he
 KK Venugopal said that if confidential information was made public without the knowledge of France, it would be a violation of the inter-governmental Agreement
 sarkaar ne rafaal deal ke nyaayik pareekshan kaa virodh kiya he
 KK Venugopal said that he too has not seen the sealed report
 isliye keemat ke bare main kuch nahin kah sakate hai
 - Chief Justice asked if the price was not disclosed in the old 2007 deal also? - kya us vakt bhi hathiyaaron va upkarnon kii jaankaree ko gopneey rakhaa gaya tha - The Attorney General said that was confidential even at that time
 is par prashanth bhushan ne hastkshep kiya or kuch report dikhaane kii koshish kii, lekin tab chif justise ne kaha ki aapane vakt par ye report daakhil nahin kii
 There can no longer be a two-hour hearing
 sunwaayee ke dauraan jab ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar rafaal vimaan kargil yuddh ke dauraan bharat ke paas hota to kai sainikon kii jaan bachaai ja sakati thi
 On this, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi intervened to the Attorney General, saying that the Kargil war took place in 1999-2000 and the Rafale aircraft arrived in 2014
 is tarah ke bayaan mat dijie
 a lot of questions are being answered even among journalists about this
 unka kahana he ki dasso ke siio ne sawaalon ke jawaab sahi nahin die or unase kai sawaal nahin puche ja sake
 Julian Boussaw, a journalist with La Monde, has raised many questions after an interview with ANI
 siio- hamane 2011 main hi reliance group se baatcheet shuru kar di thi, tab oland raashtrapati nahin the
 Modi was not the Prime Minister
 - julian- dasso kii tab mukesh ambani ke reliance group se baat ho rahi thi na ki anil ambani ke reliance group se
 It was a different company
 rafaal ke siio se puche gaye sawaal or unke jawaab
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said: Dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance 
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the existing Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: "but the reliance at that time was different, it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different the French President was different , you are the only one who is common 
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance , within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company Now you will read this answer again
 hansi bhi aegi or ronaa bhi aayega
 The ceo's reply suggests that he is not the CEO of Dasso Aviation, the CEO of Sattu's packing company
 main hindi main bataa rahaa hum ki siio angrezi main yah kah rahe hai ki 'hamane aage badhane kaa faisla kiya to reliance ke saath hi jude rahane kaa faisla kiya
 Both are brothers within the same group and sons of former leader Ambani, so it was in the same line, from one company or another within the group
 'tippaniyan Does the CEO of Dasso feel that people do not know English in India
 kuch bhi bol denge
 Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani separated in 2005
 ham sab jaanate hai ki mukesh ambani kii kai companiyaan hai, use reliance group kehete hai
 Anil Ambani has several companies called Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
 yani donon alag-alag group hai
 Not two different companies of one group
 mukesh ambani kaa samooh apane balanceshit main kai hazaar karod ke phaayde dikhaata he
 Anil Ambani's group is said to be in a loss of several thousand crores
 agar ye donon ek hi group ke hote to inkaa kul munafa bhi ek hota or kul ghaataa bhi ek hota
 is that so
 nahin he
 Does the CEO of Dasso Avision, who is entering into a multi-crore deal with India, not even know that Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani belong to the same group? adaalat se jo faisla aayega, wo aayega magar ye jo bayaan aa rahe hai, unka kya kiya jaae
 In response to not being experienced by Reliance, it is good to start from zero
 to dasso bataae ki usne jo tees ofaset partner chune hai usamen se kitni aisi companiyaan hai, jo anil ambani kii company kii tarah shunya se shuru kar rahi hai
 That is, those who used to make wedding marriage plates and now they have been given the contract to make the parts of Rafal
 eenai kii smita prakaash se siio trephiye kehete hai ki meri company clin he
 But in 1998 Dasso's director was sentenced to 18 months in the case of taking bribe
 usne kantrect lene ke liye 1998 main belgium ke netaaon ko rishwat di thi
 See when and when the news of Rafal has appeared on the front page
 kya tabhi chhapi he jab kisi mantri ne yaa rafaal banane vaali company ne saude main anil ambani kii company ko laabh pahunchane se inkaar kiya he, ghotaalaa na hone kaa daawa kiya he
 Has the news of Rafal appeared prominently on the front page even when Rahul Gandhi has made allegations about Rafal
 is tarah se aap test karenge ki yah khabar aapke akhbaar ke liye pramukh kab he
 After testing the prominence, you test the details
 rafaal vimaan main ghotaalaa hua, is sambandh main jitne aarope lage hai, kya unhen vistaar se chapa gaya he, rafaal vimaan main ghotaalaa nahin hua kya is khabar ko puure vistaar ke saath chapa gaya he
 You will understand the difference
 rafaal maamle main sirf rahul gandhi aarope nahin laga rahe hai
 Many journalists covering defense matters such as Ajay Shukla in Business Standard, Rohini Singh in Wire, Sushant Singh in Express, Vishnu Som in NDTV and Saikat Dutta in Scroll can see the reporting
 rohinee singh ne to apni report main dastauez bhi lagaae
 The reports of these journalists have also raised many questions, has your Hindi newspaper brought these questions to you, do you know how Ajay Shukla has written a report in three installments about how the Rafale plane deal was 40 percent from the earlier deal It has been done at a higher price
 agar aapako ye sawaal nahin maaloom to phir aap rafaal saude ko nahin samaj paaenge
 Apart from this, Prashant Bhushan, Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie have filed petitions in the court
 sawaal uthaae hai
 These people also keep press conferences in many places
 kya inke uthaae sawaalon ko detail main chapa jaataa he
 The answers to your questions will tell you how much your newspaper has updated regarding the Rafale deal
 yahi test aap channelon ke saath kar sakate hai
 Select one of the bulletins and then analyze it
 supreme court main rafaal vimaan par teen baar sunwaayee ho chuki he
 The hearing lasted for about three and a half hours on 14 November
 chif justise ranjan gogoi kii bench is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi he
 Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Joseph are also part of this bench
 dipti cheef of air staff bhi is maamle main apana paksh rakhane aae the tab adaalat main chutki bhi lee gai ki air marshall ab ja sakate hai, yah alag kism kaa war room he
 Three top Air Force officers have presented their case
 yashavanth sinha, arun shouri or sanjay singh, vinit handa, em el sharma yachikakarta hai jo is maamle kii esaiti jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 KK Venugopal was responding on behalf of the government
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki isaki samiksha court ko nahin kerani chahie lekin sunwaayee ke baad kya faisla aayega intazaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Journalists who have gone to cover the case say that both the government and the petitioner were asked difficult questions on behalf of the bench
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne lagaataar reporting kii he
 i am presenting part of their sent news
 - prashanth bhushan kaa sawaal tha ki do deshon kii sarkaar ke bich agreement se kiya gaya taaki tender na jari kerani pade
 - The government has not told who will be responsible if Dasso is not able to provide Rafaal
 - sarkaar ne france se sowran guarantee nahin lee, inter governmental agreement main aage bad gai
 - The Law Ministry had expressed concern that if there was a dispute, the decision would be in Geneva which would not be good for India
 - is par court ne sarkaar se poocha ki kya france ne bharat ko guarantee di he? - Attorney General said there is no sovereign guarantee, letter of comfort
 - chif justise ne poocha ki to aapke paas koi guarantee nahin he? - The government says that this is a sensitive matter
 desh kii suraksha kaa maamla he
 After this there was a debate about the offset partner
 aap jaanate hai ki dasso ne ofaset partner ke rup main anil ambani kii company ko apana partner chunaa he
 According to the company, it has selected thirty companies including Ambani as partners
 is sawaal kaa sandarbh he ki deal hone ke kuch din pehle tak hindustan aironotics limited kaa naam iske liye tha, magar deal hone ke baad pataa chalata he ki ofaset partner ke rup main anil ambani kii company ko jagah mili he
 Rahul Gandhi is constantly alleging that Anil Ambani's company has been benefited
 ofaset partner ke sawaal par bhi sarkaar ne sikret rakhane kii sharton kaa hawala diya
 Prashant Bhushan raised questions
 - prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar kahati he ki vah ofaset partner ke bare main nahin jaanati he jo tay kii gai prakriya ke khilaaf he
 Prashant Bhushan alleged that the process of fixing the offset was changed from the back date
 - atorni general ne kaha he ki guppatata kaa qaraar he to baaten gupt rakhni hi hongi
 - Justice m Joseph then asked what would happen if the offset partner ran away? - tab sarkaar ne kaha ki kantrect kii sharten ofaset partner par bhi lagu hoti hai
 - Prashant Bhushan said that how can the government say that it is not known when the process is clear that it cannot happen without the permission of the Defense Minister
 - atorni general kehete hai ki ofaset partner kaa faisla hone se pehle hi saude par dastakhat ho gaye the
 - We needed 36 aircraft immediately, so changed the deal
 supreme court ke faisle se hi pataa chalegaa ki ofaset partner ke liye deal badal di gai yaa phir vaaki jaldi vimaan chahie the iske liye deal badali gai
 On this, the petitioners say that between 2019 and 22 only planes will arrive
 saude ke saadhe teen saal ho gaye magar abhi tak ek bhi vimaan nahin aayaa he
 At the press conference of March 25, 2015, Dasso CEO said that the deal would be finalized soon
 saude ke 95 fisadi par sahmati ban gai he
 Through technology transfer, HAL will create many devices
 magar echeel saude se baahar ho gai
 No one was asked
 raksha mantri ko bhi pataa nahin tha
 The government knows that 36 aircraft is not enough for the Air Force, then why was it reduced from 126 to 36
 pradhanmantri ne kaise ghoshnaa kar di
 The deal was changed because the Prime Minister wanted to include Ambani
 ab ham aapako do video dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 March 25, 2015, a month before the deal was signed and November 13, 2018, both belong to the same person
 dasso ke siio kaa
 On 25 March, the same person is taking the name of HAL, but is ani's Smita telling Prakash what he knew then, why he had taken the name of HAL
 aap bhi padhein
 
 
 After an outstanding amount of work and some discussion, you can imagine my great satisfaction to hear on one hand from the Indian Air Force chief of staff that he wants a combat proven aircraft which could be the Rafale
 
 
 and on the other hand from HAL chairman that we are in agreement for the responsibilities sharing, considering as well our conformity with the RFP (request for Proposal) in order to be in line with the rules of this competition
 i strongly believe that contract finalisation and signature would come very soon
 " On 15 April 2015, an agreement is signed between Prime Minister Modi and former President Hollande
 siio kaa yah bayaan 25 march 2015 kaa he
 Twenty days before the agreement
 isamen aapane padhaa ki ve bol rahe hai ki echeel ke chairman se sunakar aap mere santosh kii kalpana kar sakate hai
 The chairman has said that HAL is ready to shoulder the responsibilities associated with the deal
 ab ve 13 november ko kya kehete hai eenai kii smita prakaash se, wo bhi padhie
 
 
 "as a supplier we were pushing to try to get the deal
 We were the winner in 2012
 So we really wanted to get the deal
 And the deal was that for 126 aircraft
 So we were still working on that deal with, as i said, HAL and Indian Air Force
 It was true, as i said also, and i believe that the government of India said that it's too long and too difficult, the 126
 So go ahead with 36, supplied by Government of France
 This was exactly what happened in 2015
 " 13 november ko kah rahe hai ek saplir ke naate ham yah deal chaahate the
 The deal was 126 aircraft
 ham echeel or bhartiya vayusena ke saath kaam kar rahe the
 i said about HAL, it's true
 magar ve yah nahin bataa rahe hai ki echeel deal se kaise baahar ho gai
 They are not even saying that they had said about HAL but when she got out of the deal she was surprised to hear
 unke jawaab main bahut dam nahin dikhataa he
 He also praises HAL but lacks clarity in response
 aap khud bhi unke saare jawaab ko suniye or samajhane kaa prayaas kiijie
 So how was the offset partner chosen, what was the process for its selection, did it follow, then there was a debate about the price of Rafal Biman
 ajay shukla ne bijness standard main rafaal kii keemton par teen kishton kii lambii report likhi he
 In which it has been claimed that according to the agreement reached during the Modi government, 40 percent more price is being given
 aapako pataa den ki eenai kii smita prakaash se dasso ke siio ne daawa kiya he ki deal pehle se 9 pratishat sasti he
 On August 28, Finance Minister and former Defense Minister Arun Jaitley writes on the blog that the NDA deal is 9 percent cheaper than UPA
 jetali basic aircraft ke bare main 9 pratishat sasti deal kii baat kar rahe hai
 Then Jaitley says that this aircraft is equipped according to the needs of India, which is also 20 percent less than the UPA
 dasson ke siio ne yah to kaha he ki maujuuda aircraft 9 pratishat sasta he lekin unke jawaab se saaf nahin hota ki ve basic aircraft kii baat kar rahe hai yaa phir jetali ke anusaar bharat kii jaruraton se las aircraft kii keemat kii baat kar rahe hai
 - The government has submitted the price of Rafale aircraft in a sealed envelope to the Supreme Court
 - prashanth bhushan kii daleel thi ki keemat se rashtriya suraksha ko khatra nahin he
 - All information about Rafale aircraft is public
 - sansad main bhi rafaal vimaan kii keemat bataai ja chuki he
 - Attorney General said that the price of the jet without weapons and equipment was stated in the Parliament
 - bina france kii manzuri ke puri tarah taiyaar jet kii keemat nahin bataa sakate hai
 However, on 8 March, President Macron of France told India Today that the Modi government can share the details of Rafale aircraft with the opposition
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar france kii jaankaree ke bina gopneey jaankaree saarvajanik kii gai to yah inter garvanmental agreement kaa ulanghan hoga
 The government has opposed the judicial trial of the Rafale deal
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki unhone bhi silband report nahin dekhi he
 So, can't say anything about the price
 - chif justise ne poocha ki kya 2007 kii puraani deal main bhi keemat kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya tha? - Whether information about weapons and equipment was kept confidential even at that time - atorni general ne kaha ki us vakt bhi gopneey tha
 On this Prashant Bhushan intervened and tried to show some report, but then the Chief Justice said that you did not file this report on time
 ab do ghante kii sunwaayee nahin ho sakati he
 During the hearing, KK Venugopal said that many soldiers' lives could have been saved if the Rafale aircraft were near India during the Kargil war
 is par chif justise ranjan gogoi ne atorni general ko tokate hue kaha ki kargil yuddh 1999-2000 main hua tha or rafaal vimaan 2014 main aayaa he
 Do not give such statements
 ise lekar patrakaron ke bich bhi khub sawaal jawaab ho rahe hai
 He says that the CEO of Dasso did not answer the questions correctly and could not be asked many questions
 laa mond ke ek patrkaar hai julian bassow ne eenai ko die intervyuu ke baad kai sawaal uthaae hai
 CEO- We started talking to Reliance Group in 2011, when Holland was not President
 modi pradhanmantri nahin the
 julian-dasso was talking to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Group and not Anil Ambani's Reliance Group
 wo alag company thi
 Questions and answers to the CEO of Rafal
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said :dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that the two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the current Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: " But the reliance at that time was different , it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different, the French President was different, you are the only one who is common
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance, within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company ab aap is jawaab ko phir se padhiega
 Laughter will come and cry will also come
 siio ke is jawaab se lagata he ki ve dasso aviation ke siio nahin hai, sattu kii packing karne vaali company ke siio lagate hai
 i am telling in Hindi that the CEO is saying in English that 'we decided to move forward and decided to stay connected with Reliance
 ek hi group ke bheetar donon bhai hai or purv leader ambani ke bete hai, lihaaza yah usee line main tha, ek group ke bheetar kii ek yaa duusari company se tha
 Comments kya dasso ke siio ko ye lagata he ki bharat main logon ko angreji nahin aati he
 Will speak anything
 2005 main mukesh ambani or anil ambani alag ho gaye the
 We all know that Mukesh Ambani has many companies, it is called Reliance Group
 anil ambani kii kai companiyaan hai jise anil dhirubhai ambani group kehete hai
 That is, both are different groups
 na ki ek group kii do alag-alag companiyaan
 Mukesh Ambani's group shows the benefits of several thousand crores in its balance sheet
 anil ambani kaa group kai hazaar karod ke ghate main bataaya jaataa he
 If these two belonged to the same group, their total profit would also be one and the total loss would also be one
 kya aisa he
 Is not
 kya dasso avishan kaa siio jo bharat ke saath kai hazaar karod kaa sauda kar rahaa he, use itnaa bhi nahin maaloom he ki mukesh ambani or anil ambani ek hi group ke nahin hai
 The decision that will come from the court will come, but what should be done with these statements that are coming
 reliance ke anbhavi na hone ke jawaab main kehete hai ki shunya se shuru hona acha hota he
 So Dasso tell how many of the thirty offset partners he has chosen, which are starting from zero like Anil Ambani's company
 yani jo pehle shaadi byaah ke plate banaati thim or ab unhen rafaal ke kal purze banane kaa theka diya gaya he
 CEO Trafiye from Smita Prakash of ANI says that my company is clean

 If you do not know this question, then you will not understand the Rafale deal
 iske alaava prashanth bhushan, yashavanth sinha, arun shouri ne court main yachika di he
 Has raised questions
 ye log kai jagahon par press conference bhi karte rahete hai
 Are their questions raised in detail? aapke sawaalon ke jawaab aapako bataa denge ki rafaal saude ko lekar aapke akhbaar ne kitna apadet kiya he

 The Rafale plane has been heard thrice in the Supreme Court
 14 november ko kareeb saadhe teen ghante kii sunwaayee chali
 The bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi is hearing the case
 justise sanjay kishan kaul or justise joseph bhi is bench kaa hissaa hai
 The Deputy Chief of Air Staff also came to present his case in this case, when the court was also pinched that Air Marshals can go now, it is a different type of war room
 air force ke teen bade adhikariyon ne apana paksh rakhaa he
 Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie and Sanjay Singh, Vinit Handa, ML Sharma are the petitioners seeking SIT investigation in the matter
 sarkaar kii taraf se ke ke venugopal jawaab de rahe the
 The government says that it should not be reviewed by the court, but what decision will come after the hearing can be waited
 maamle ko cover karne gaye patrakaron kaa kahana he ki bench kii taraf se sarkaar or yachikakarta donon se mushkil sawaal puche gaye
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava has done continuous reporting
 unheen kii bheji khabar kaa hissaa pesh kar rahaa hum
 The question of Prashant Bhushan was that the agreement between the government of two countries was done so that tender would not be issued
 - sarkaar ne yah nahin bataaya ki agar dasso rafaal nahin de paati he to koun zimmedaar hoga
 - The government did not take the sovereign guarantee from France, proceeded to the inter-governmental Agreement
 - kanoon mantralay ne chintaa jataai thi ki agar vivaad hua to faisla geneva main hoga jo bharat ke liye acha nahin hoga
 On this, the court asked the government whether France had given a guarantee to India? - atarni general ne kaha ki koi samprabhu guarantee nahin he, letters of confort he
 - Chief Justice asked if you have no guarantee? - sarkaar kahati he ki yah samvedansheel maamla he
 There is a matter of security of the country
 iske baad ofaset partner ko lekar bahes chhidi
 You know that Dasso has chosen Anil Ambani's company as its partner as an offset partner
 company ke hisaab se usne ambani sahit tees companiyon ko partner chunaa he
 There is a reference to the question that Hindustan Aeronautics Limited was named for it till a few days before the deal, but after the deal, it is known that Anil Ambani's company has got a place as an offset partner
 rahul gandhi lagaataar aarope laga rahe hai ki anil ambani kii company ko phayda pahunchaaya gaya he
 On the question of the offset partner, the government also cited the conditions of keeping secret
 prashanth bhushan ne sawaal uthaae
 - Prashant Bhushan said that the government says that it does not know about the offset partner which is against the procedure laid down
 - prashanth bhushan ne aarope lagaaya ki ofaset tay karne kii prakriya badal kar back date se lagu kar di gai
 - The Attorney General has said that if there is an agreement of confidentiality, then things have to be kept secret
 - tab justise ke em joseph ne poocha ki agar ofaset partner bhaag gaya tab kya hoga? - Then the government said that the contract conditions also apply to the offset partner
 - prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar kaise kah sakati he ki pataa nahin jabaki prakriya se saaf he ki raksha mantri kii anumati ke bina nahin ho saktaa he
 - The Attorney General says that the deal was signed before the offset partner was decided
 - hamen 36 vimaan fouran chahie thi isliye deal badal di
 It will be known only by the decision of the Supreme Court that the deal was changed for the offset partner or if the aircraft was needed really quickly, the deal was changed for this
 is par yachikakartaon kaa kahana he ki 2019 se 22 ke bich hi vimaan aaenge
 It has been three and a half years since the deal, but not a single aircraft has arrived yet
 25 march 2015 ke press conferes main dasso ke siio ne kaha ki deal jald final hogi
 95% of the deal has been agreed
 takanic transfar ke zarie echeel kai upkaran banayega
 But HAL pulled out of the deal
 kisi se nahin poocha gaya
 The Defense Minister did not even know
 sarkaar jaanati he ki airforce ke liye 36 vimaan kaaphi nahin he to phir 126 se ghataakar 36 kyon kiya gaya
 How did the Prime Minister declare
 deal isliye badali gai kyonki pradhanmantri ambani ko shaamil karnaa chaahate the
 Now we want to show you two videos
 25 march 2015 kaa yani deal hone ke ek maheenaa pehle kaa or 13 november 2018 kaa, donon ek hi shaks kaa he
 Of the CEO of Dasso
 25 march ko yahi shaks echeel kaa naam le rahaa he magar kya eenai kii smita prakaash ko bataa rahaa he ki use tab kya jaankaree thi, usne kyon echeel kaa naam liya tha

 So we really wanted to get the deal
 And the deal was that for 126 aircraft
 So we were still working on that deal with, as i said, HAL and Indian Air Force
 It was true, as i said also, and i believe that the government of India said that it's too long and too difficult, the 126

 This was exactly what happened in 2015

 unka kahana he ki dasso ke siio ne sawaalon ke jawaab sahi nahin die or unase kai sawaal nahin puche ja sake
 Julian Boussaw, a journalist with La Monde, has raised many questions after an interview with ANI
 siio- hamane 2011 main hi reliance group se baatcheet shuru kar di thi, tab oland raashtrapati nahin the
 Modi was not the Prime Minister
 - julian- dasso kii tab mukesh ambani ke reliance group se baat ho rahi thi na ki anil ambani ke reliance group se

 rafaal ke siio se puche gaye sawaal or unke jawaab
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said: Dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance 
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the existing Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: "but the reliance at that time was different, it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different the French President was different , you are the only one who is common 
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance , within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company Now you will read this answer again
 hansi bhi aegi or ronaa bhi aayega
 The ceo's reply suggests that he is not the CEO of Dasso Aviation, the CEO of Sattu's packing company
 main hindi main bataa rahaa hum ki siio angrezi main yah kah rahe hai ki 'hamane aage badhane kaa faisla kiya to reliance ke saath hi jude rahane kaa faisla kiya
 Both are brothers within the same group and sons of former leader Ambani, so it was in the same line, from one company or another within the group
 'tippaniyan Does the CEO of Dasso feel that people do not know English in India
 kuch bhi bol denge
 Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani separated in 2005
 ham sab jaanate hai ki mukesh ambani kii kai companiyaan hai, use reliance group kehete hai
 Anil Ambani has several companies called Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
 yani donon alag-alag group hai
 Not two different companies of one group
 mukesh ambani kaa samooh apane balanceshit main kai hazaar karod ke phaayde dikhaata he
 Anil Ambani's group is said to be in a loss of several thousand crores
 agar ye donon ek hi group ke hote to inkaa kul munafa bhi ek hota or kul ghaataa bhi ek hota
 is that so
 nahin he
 Does the CEO of Dasso Avision, who is entering into a multi-crore deal with India, not even know that Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani belong to the same group? adaalat se jo faisla aayega, wo aayega magar ye jo bayaan aa rahe hai, unka kya kiya jaae
 In response to not being experienced by Reliance, it is good to start from zero
 to dasso bataae ki usne jo tees ofaset partner chune hai usamen se kitni aisi companiyaan hai, jo anil ambani kii company kii tarah shunya se shuru kar rahi hai
 That is, those who used to make wedding marriage plates and now they have been given the contract to make the parts of Rafal

 - The Attorney General has said that if there is an agreement of confidentiality, then things have to be kept secret
 - tab justise ke em joseph ne poocha ki agar ofaset partner bhaag gaya tab kya hoga? - Then the government said that the contract conditions also apply to the offset partner
 - prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar kaise kah sakati he ki pataa nahin jabaki prakriya se saaf he ki raksha mantri kii anumati ke bina nahin ho saktaa he
 - The Attorney General says that the deal was signed before the offset partner was decided
 - hamen 36 vimaan fouran chahie thi isliye deal badal di
 It will be known only by the decision of the Supreme Court that the deal was changed for the offset partner or if the aircraft was needed really quickly, the deal was changed for this
 is par yachikakartaon kaa kahana he ki 2019 se 22 ke bich hi vimaan aaenge
 It has been three and a half years since the deal, but not a single aircraft has arrived yet
 25 march 2015 ke press conferes main dasso ke siio ne kaha ki deal jald final hogi
 95% of the deal has been agreed
 takanic transfar ke zarie echeel kai upkaran banayega
 But HAL pulled out of the deal
 kisi se nahin poocha gaya
 The Defense Minister did not even know
 sarkaar jaanati he ki airforce ke liye 36 vimaan kaaphi nahin he to phir 126 se ghataakar 36 kyon kiya gaya
 How did the Prime Minister declare
 deal isliye badali gai kyonki pradhanmantri ambani ko shaamil karnaa chaahate the
 Now we want to show you two videos
 25 march 2015 kaa yani deal hone ke ek maheenaa pehle kaa or 13 november 2018 kaa, donon ek hi shaks kaa he
 Of the CEO of Dasso
 25 march ko yahi shaks echeel kaa naam le rahaa he magar kya eenai kii smita prakaash ko bataa rahaa he ki use tab kya jaankaree thi, usne kyon echeel kaa naam liya tha

 After an outstanding amount of work and some discussion, you can imagine my great satisfaction to hear on one hand from the Indian Air Force chief of staff that he wants a combat proven aircraft which could be the Rafale
 
 
 and on the other hand from HAL chairman that we are in agreement for the responsibilities sharing, considering as well our conformity with the RFP (request for Proposal) in order to be in line with the rules of this competition
 i strongly believe that contract finalisation and signature would come very soon
 " 15 april 2015 ko pradhanmantri modi or purv raashtrapati oland ke bich qaraar hota he
 The ceo's statement is dated 25 March 2015
 qaraar se bees din pehle kaa
 In it you read that they are saying that you can imagine my satisfaction by hearing from the Chairman of HAL
 chairman ne kaha he ki echeel is deal se judi zimmedaariyon ko uthaane ke liye taiyaar he
 Now what they say on November 13 is from Smita Prakash of ANI, read that too
 
 
 "as a supplier we were pushing to try to get the deal
 We were the winner in 2012
 So we really wanted to get the deal
 And the deal was that for 126 aircraft
 So we were still working on that deal with, as i said, HAL and Indian Air Force
 It was true, as i said also, and i believe that the government of India said that it's too long and too difficult, the 126
 So go ahead with 36, supplied by Government of France
 This was exactly what happened in 2015
 " On November 13, we are saying that as a supplier we wanted this deal
 deal 126 vimaanon kii thi
 We were working with HAL and the Indian Air Force
 maine echeel ke bare main kaha tha, yah sach he
 But they are not telling how HAL got out of the deal
 ve yah bhi nahin kah rahe hai ki echeel ke bare main unhone kaha to tha magar jab wo deal se baahar ho gai to sunakar hairaani hui
 His answer does not show much power
 ve echeel kii tarif bhi karte hai lekin jawaab main spashtataa nahin he
 Listen to all their answers yourself and try to understand
 to ofaset partner kaise chunaa gaya, iske chune jane kii kya prakriya thi, kya uskaa paalan hua, phir rafaal bimaan ke daam ko lekar bahes hai
 Ajay Shukla has written a long report of three installments on Rafale prices in Business Standard
 jisamen daawa kiya he ki modi sarkaar ke samay jo qaraar hua he uske anusaar 40 pratishat adhik keemat di ja rahi he
 Let us know that Dasso CEO from ani's Smita Prakash has claimed that the deal is already 9 percent cheaper
 28 agast ko vitt mantri or purv raksha mantri arun jetali blog likhte he ki endie kii deal upie se 9 pratishat sasti he
 Jaitley is talking about 9 percent cheaper deals on basic aircraft
 phir jetali kehete hai ki bharat kii zaruuraton ke mutabik is aircraft ko las kiya jaataa he wo bhi upie kii tulana main 20 pratishat kam he
 The CEO of Dasson has said that the existing aircraft are 9 per cent cheaper but their reply does not indicate whether they are talking about basic aircraft or the price of aircraft equipped with India's needs according to Jaitley
 - sarkaar ne rafaal vimaan kii keemat silband lipaphe main supreme court ko saunpi he
 - Prashant Bhushan argued that price did not threaten national security
 - rafaal vimaan kii sari jaankariyaan saarvajanik hai
 - The price of Rafale aircraft has also been mentioned in Parliament
 - atarni general ne kaha ki sansad main bina hathiyaar va upkaran se las jet kii keemat bataai gai
 - Without the approval of France, you cannot tell the price of a fully finished jet
 vaise 8 march ko india today se france ke raashtrapati maikron ne kaha tha ki modi sarkaar chaahe to rafaal vimaan ke ditels vipaksh se saajha kar sakati he
 KK Venugopal said that if confidential information was made public without the knowledge of France, it would be a violation of the inter-governmental Agreement
 sarkaar ne rafaal deal ke nyaayik pareekshan kaa virodh kiya he
 KK Venugopal said that he too has not seen the sealed report
 isliye keemat ke bare main kuch nahin kah sakate hai
 - Chief Justice asked if the price was not disclosed in the old 2007 deal also? - kya us vakt bhi hathiyaaron va upkarnon kii jaankaree ko gopneey rakhaa gaya tha - The Attorney General said that was confidential even at that time
 is par prashanth bhushan ne hastkshep kiya or kuch report dikhaane kii koshish kii, lekin tab chif justise ne kaha ki aapane vakt par ye report daakhil nahin kii
 There can no longer be a two-hour hearing
 sunwaayee ke dauraan jab ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar rafaal vimaan kargil yuddh ke dauraan bharat ke paas hota to kai sainikon kii jaan bachaai ja sakati thi
 On this, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi intervened to the Attorney General, saying that the Kargil war took place in 1999-2000 and the Rafale aircraft arrived in 2014
 is tarah ke bayaan mat dijie
 a lot of questions are being answered even among journalists about this
 unka kahana he ki dasso ke siio ne sawaalon ke jawaab sahi nahin die or unase kai sawaal nahin puche ja sake
 Julian Boussaw, a journalist with La Monde, has raised many questions after an interview with ANI
 siio- hamane 2011 main hi reliance group se baatcheet shuru kar di thi, tab oland raashtrapati nahin the
 Modi was not the Prime Minister
 - julian- dasso kii tab mukesh ambani ke reliance group se baat ho rahi thi na ki anil ambani ke reliance group se
 It was a different company
 rafaal ke siio se puche gaye sawaal or unke jawaab
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said: Dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance 
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the existing Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: "but the reliance at that time was different, it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different the French President was different , you are the only one who is common 
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance , within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company Now you will read this answer again
 hansi bhi aegi or ronaa bhi aayega
 The ceo's reply suggests that he is not the CEO of Dasso Aviation, the CEO of Sattu's packing company
 main hindi main bataa rahaa hum ki siio angrezi main yah kah rahe hai ki 'hamane aage badhane kaa faisla kiya to reliance ke saath hi jude rahane kaa faisla kiya
 Both are brothers within the same group and sons of former leader Ambani, so it was in the same line, from one company or another within the group
 'tippaniyan Does the CEO of Dasso feel that people do not know English in India
 kuch bhi bol denge
 Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani separated in 2005
 ham sab jaanate hai ki mukesh ambani kii kai companiyaan hai, use reliance group kehete hai
 Anil Ambani has several companies called Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
 yani donon alag-alag group hai
 Not two different companies of one group
 mukesh ambani kaa samooh apane balanceshit main kai hazaar karod ke phaayde dikhaata he
 Anil Ambani's group is said to be in a loss of several thousand crores
 agar ye donon ek hi group ke hote to inkaa kul munafa bhi ek hota or kul ghaataa bhi ek hota
 is that so
 nahin he
 Does the CEO of Dasso Avision, who is entering into a multi-crore deal with India, not even know that Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani belong to the same group? adaalat se jo faisla aayega, wo aayega magar ye jo bayaan aa rahe hai, unka kya kiya jaae
 In response to not being experienced by Reliance, it is good to start from zero
 to dasso bataae ki usne jo tees ofaset partner chune hai usamen se kitni aisi companiyaan hai, jo anil ambani kii company kii tarah shunya se shuru kar rahi hai
 That is, those who used to make wedding marriage plates and now they have been given the contract to make the parts of Rafal
 eenai kii smita prakaash se siio trephiye kehete hai ki meri company clin he
 But in 1998 Dasso's director was sentenced to 18 months in the case of taking bribe
 usne kantrect lene ke liye 1998 main belgium ke netaaon ko rishwat di thi
 After this there was a debate about the offset partner
 aap jaanate hai ki dasso ne ofaset partner ke rup main anil ambani kii company ko apana partner chunaa he
 According to the company, it has selected thirty companies including Ambani as partners
 is sawaal kaa sandarbh he ki deal hone ke kuch din pehle tak hindustan aironotics limited kaa naam iske liye tha, magar deal hone ke baad pataa chalata he ki ofaset partner ke rup main anil ambani kii company ko jagah mili he
 Rahul Gandhi is constantly alleging that Anil Ambani's company has been benefited
 ofaset partner ke sawaal par bhi sarkaar ne sikret rakhane kii sharton kaa hawala diya
 Prashant Bhushan raised questions
 - prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar kahati he ki vah ofaset partner ke bare main nahin jaanati he jo tay kii gai prakriya ke khilaaf he
 Prashant Bhushan alleged that the process of fixing the offset was changed from the back date
 - atorni general ne kaha he ki guppatata kaa qaraar he to baaten gupt rakhni hi hongi
 - Justice m Joseph then asked what would happen if the offset partner ran away? - tab sarkaar ne kaha ki kantrect kii sharten ofaset partner par bhi lagu hoti hai
 - Prashant Bhushan said that how can the government say that it is not known when the process is clear that it cannot happen without the permission of the Defense Minister
 - atorni general kehete hai ki ofaset partner kaa faisla hone se pehle hi saude par dastakhat ho gaye the
 - We needed 36 aircraft immediately, so changed the deal
 supreme court ke faisle se hi pataa chalegaa ki ofaset partner ke liye deal badal di gai yaa phir vaaki jaldi vimaan chahie the iske liye deal badali gai
 On this, the petitioners say that between 2019 and 22 only planes will arrive
 saude ke saadhe teen saal ho gaye magar abhi tak ek bhi vimaan nahin aayaa he
 At the press conference of March 25, 2015, Dasso CEO said that the deal would be finalized soon
 saude ke 95 fisadi par sahmati ban gai he
 Through technology transfer, HAL will create many devices
 magar echeel saude se baahar ho gai
 No one was asked
 raksha mantri ko bhi pataa nahin tha
 The government knows that 36 aircraft is not enough for the Air Force, then why was it reduced from 126 to 36
 pradhanmantri ne kaise ghoshnaa kar di
 The deal was changed because the Prime Minister wanted to include Ambani
 ab ham aapako do video dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 March 25, 2015, a month before the deal was signed and November 13, 2018, both belong to the same person
 dasso ke siio kaa
 On 25 March, the same person is taking the name of HAL, but is ani's Smita telling Prakash what he knew then, why he had taken the name of HAL
 aap bhi padhein
 
 
 After an outstanding amount of work and some discussion, you can imagine my great satisfaction to hear on one hand from the Indian Air Force chief of staff that he wants a combat proven aircraft which could be the Rafale
 
 
 and on the other hand from HAL chairman that we are in agreement for the responsibilities sharing, considering as well our conformity with the RFP (request for Proposal) in order to be in line with the rules of this competition
 i strongly believe that contract finalisation and signature would come very soon
 " On 15 April 2015, an agreement is signed between Prime Minister Modi and former President Hollande
 siio kaa yah bayaan 25 march 2015 kaa he
 Twenty days before the agreement
 isamen aapane padhaa ki ve bol rahe hai ki echeel ke chairman se sunakar aap mere santosh kii kalpana kar sakate hai
 The chairman has said that HAL is ready to shoulder the responsibilities associated with the deal
 ab ve 13 november ko kya kehete hai eenai kii smita prakaash se, wo bhi padhie

 magar ve yah nahin bataa rahe hai ki echeel deal se kaise baahar ho gai
 They are not even saying that they had said about HAL but when she got out of the deal she was surprised to hear
 unke jawaab main bahut dam nahin dikhataa he
 He also praises HAL but lacks clarity in response
 aap khud bhi unke saare jawaab ko suniye or samajhane kaa prayaas kiijie
 So how was the offset partner chosen, what was the process for its selection, did it follow, then there was a debate about the price of Rafal Biman
 ajay shukla ne bijness standard main rafaal kii keemton par teen kishton kii lambii report likhi he
 In which it has been claimed that according to the agreement reached during the Modi government, 40 percent more price is being given
 aapako pataa den ki eenai kii smita prakaash se dasso ke siio ne daawa kiya he ki deal pehle se 9 pratishat sasti he
 On August 28, Finance Minister and former Defense Minister Arun Jaitley writes on the blog that the NDA deal is 9 percent cheaper than UPA
 jetali basic aircraft ke bare main 9 pratishat sasti deal kii baat kar rahe hai
 Then Jaitley says that this aircraft is equipped according to the needs of India, which is also 20 percent less than the UPA
 dasson ke siio ne yah to kaha he ki maujuuda aircraft 9 pratishat sasta he lekin unke jawaab se saaf nahin hota ki ve basic aircraft kii baat kar rahe hai yaa phir jetali ke anusaar bharat kii jaruraton se las aircraft kii keemat kii baat kar rahe hai
 - The government has submitted the price of Rafale aircraft in a sealed envelope to the Supreme Court
 - prashanth bhushan kii daleel thi ki keemat se rashtriya suraksha ko khatra nahin he
 - All information about Rafale aircraft is public
 - sansad main bhi rafaal vimaan kii keemat bataai ja chuki he
 - Attorney General said that the price of the jet without weapons and equipment was stated in the Parliament
 - bina france kii manzuri ke puri tarah taiyaar jet kii keemat nahin bataa sakate hai
 However, on 8 March, President Macron of France told India Today that the Modi government can share the details of Rafale aircraft with the opposition
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar france kii jaankaree ke bina gopneey jaankaree saarvajanik kii gai to yah inter garvanmental agreement kaa ulanghan hoga
 The government has opposed the judicial trial of the Rafale deal
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki unhone bhi silband report nahin dekhi he
 So, can't say anything about the price
 - chif justise ne poocha ki kya 2007 kii puraani deal main bhi keemat kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya tha? - Whether information about weapons and equipment was kept confidential even at that time - atorni general ne kaha ki us vakt bhi gopneey tha
 On this Prashant Bhushan intervened and tried to show some report, but then the Chief Justice said that you did not file this report on time
 ab do ghante kii sunwaayee nahin ho sakati he
 During the hearing, KK Venugopal said that many soldiers' lives could have been saved if the Rafale aircraft were near India during the Kargil war
 is par chif justise ranjan gogoi ne atorni general ko tokate hue kaha ki kargil yuddh 1999-2000 main hua tha or rafaal vimaan 2014 main aayaa he
 Do not give such statements
 ise lekar patrakaron ke bich bhi khub sawaal jawaab ho rahe hai
 He says that the CEO of Dasso did not answer the questions correctly and could not be asked many questions
 laa mond ke ek patrkaar hai julian bassow ne eenai ko die intervyuu ke baad kai sawaal uthaae hai
 CEO- We started talking to Reliance Group in 2011, when Holland was not President
 modi pradhanmantri nahin the
 julian-dasso was talking to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Group and not Anil Ambani's Reliance Group
 wo alag company thi
 Questions and answers to the CEO of Rafal
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said :dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that the two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance

 Laughter will come and cry will also come
 siio ke is jawaab se lagata he ki ve dasso aviation ke siio nahin hai, sattu kii packing karne vaali company ke siio lagate hai
 i am telling in Hindi that the CEO is saying in English that 'we decided to move forward and decided to stay connected with Reliance
 ek hi group ke bheetar donon bhai hai or purv leader ambani ke bete hai, lihaaza yah usee line main tha, ek group ke bheetar kii ek yaa duusari company se tha
 Comments kya dasso ke siio ko ye lagata he ki bharat main logon ko angreji nahin aati he
 Will speak anything
 2005 main mukesh ambani or anil ambani alag ho gaye the
 We all know that Mukesh Ambani has many companies, it is called Reliance Group
 anil ambani kii kai companiyaan hai jise anil dhirubhai ambani group kehete hai
 That is, both are different groups
 na ki ek group kii do alag-alag companiyaan
 Mukesh Ambani's group shows the benefits of several thousand crores in its balance sheet
 anil ambani kaa group kai hazaar karod ke ghate main bataaya jaataa he
 If these two belonged to the same group, their total profit would also be one and the total loss would also be one
 kya aisa he
 Is not
 kya dasso avishan kaa siio jo bharat ke saath kai hazaar karod kaa sauda kar rahaa he, use itnaa bhi nahin maaloom he ki mukesh ambani or anil ambani ek hi group ke nahin hai
 The decision that will come from the court will come, but what should be done with these statements that are coming
 reliance ke anbhavi na hone ke jawaab main kehete hai ki shunya se shuru hona acha hota he
 So Dasso tell how many of the thirty offset partners he has chosen, which are starting from zero like Anil Ambani's company
 yani jo pehle shaadi byaah ke plate banaati thim or ab unhen rafaal ke kal purze banane kaa theka diya gaya he
 CEO Trafiye from Smita Prakash of ANI says that my company is clean
 lekin 1998 main dasso ke nideshak ko rishwat lene ke maamle main 18 maheene kii sazaa hui thi
 He bribed Belgian leaders in 1998 to take up the contract

 CEO- We started talking to Reliance Group in 2011, when Holland was not President
 modi pradhanmantri nahin the
 julian-dasso was talking to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Group and not Anil Ambani's Reliance Group
 wo alag company thi
 Questions and answers to the CEO of Rafal
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said :dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that the two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the current Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: " But the reliance at that time was different , it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different, the French President was different, you are the only one who is common
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance, within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company ab aap is jawaab ko phir se padhiega
 Laughter will come and cry will also come
 siio ke is jawaab se lagata he ki ve dasso aviation ke siio nahin hai, sattu kii packing karne vaali company ke siio lagate hai
 i am telling in Hindi that the CEO is saying in English that 'we decided to move forward and decided to stay connected with Reliance
 ek hi group ke bheetar donon bhai hai or purv leader ambani ke bete hai, lihaaza yah usee line main tha, ek group ke bheetar kii ek yaa duusari company se tha
 Comments kya dasso ke siio ko ye lagata he ki bharat main logon ko angreji nahin aati he
 Will speak anything
 2005 main mukesh ambani or anil ambani alag ho gaye the
 We all know that Mukesh Ambani has many companies, it is called Reliance Group
 anil ambani kii kai companiyaan hai jise anil dhirubhai ambani group kehete hai
 That is, both are different groups
 na ki ek group kii do alag-alag companiyaan
 Mukesh Ambani's group shows the benefits of several thousand crores in its balance sheet
 anil ambani kaa group kai hazaar karod ke ghate main bataaya jaataa he
 If these two belonged to the same group, their total profit would also be one and the total loss would also be one
 kya aisa he
 Is not
 kya dasso avishan kaa siio jo bharat ke saath kai hazaar karod kaa sauda kar rahaa he, use itnaa bhi nahin maaloom he ki mukesh ambani or anil ambani ek hi group ke nahin hai
 The decision that will come from the court will come, but what should be done with these statements that are coming
 reliance ke anbhavi na hone ke jawaab main kehete hai ki shunya se shuru hona acha hota he
 So Dasso tell how many of the thirty offset partners he has chosen, which are starting from zero like Anil Ambani's company
 yani jo pehle shaadi byaah ke plate banaati thim or ab unhen rafaal ke kal purze banane kaa theka diya gaya he
 CEO Trafiye from Smita Prakash of ANI says that my company is clean
 lekin 1998 main dasso ke nideshak ko rishwat lene ke maamle main 18 maheene kii sazaa hui thi
 He bribed Belgian leaders in 1998 to take up the contract
 supreme court ke faisle se hi pataa chalegaa ki ofaset partner ke liye deal badal di gai yaa phir vaaki jaldi vimaan chahie the iske liye deal badali gai
 On this, the petitioners say that between 2019 and 22 only planes will arrive
 saude ke saadhe teen saal ho gaye magar abhi tak ek bhi vimaan nahin aayaa he
 At the press conference of March 25, 2015, Dasso CEO said that the deal would be finalized soon
 saude ke 95 fisadi par sahmati ban gai he
 Through technology transfer, HAL will create many devices
 magar echeel saude se baahar ho gai
 No one was asked
 raksha mantri ko bhi pataa nahin tha
 The government knows that 36 aircraft is not enough for the Air Force, then why was it reduced from 126 to 36
 pradhanmantri ne kaise ghoshnaa kar di
 The deal was changed because the Prime Minister wanted to include Ambani
 ab ham aapako do video dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 March 25, 2015, a month before the deal was signed and November 13, 2018, both belong to the same person
 dasso ke siio kaa
 On 25 March, the same person is taking the name of HAL, but is ani's Smita telling Prakash what he knew then, why he had taken the name of HAL
 aap bhi padhein
 
 
 After an outstanding amount of work and some discussion, you can imagine my great satisfaction to hear on one hand from the Indian Air Force chief of staff that he wants a combat proven aircraft which could be the Rafale
 
 
 and on the other hand from HAL chairman that we are in agreement for the responsibilities sharing, considering as well our conformity with the RFP (request for Proposal) in order to be in line with the rules of this competition
 i strongly believe that contract finalisation and signature would come very soon
 " On 15 April 2015, an agreement is signed between Prime Minister Modi and former President Hollande
 siio kaa yah bayaan 25 march 2015 kaa he
 Twenty days before the agreement
 isamen aapane padhaa ki ve bol rahe hai ki echeel ke chairman se sunakar aap mere santosh kii kalpana kar sakate hai
 The chairman has said that HAL is ready to shoulder the responsibilities associated with the deal
 ab ve 13 november ko kya kehete hai eenai kii smita prakaash se, wo bhi padhie
 
 
 "as a supplier we were pushing to try to get the deal
 We were the winner in 2012
 So we really wanted to get the deal
 And the deal was that for 126 aircraft
 So we were still working on that deal with, as i said, HAL and Indian Air Force
 It was true, as i said also, and i believe that the government of India said that it's too long and too difficult, the 126
 So go ahead with 36, supplied by Government of France
 This was exactly what happened in 2015
 " 13 november ko kah rahe hai ek saplir ke naate ham yah deal chaahate the
 The deal was 126 aircraft
 ham echeel or bhartiya vayusena ke saath kaam kar rahe the
 i said about HAL, it's true
 magar ve yah nahin bataa rahe hai ki echeel deal se kaise baahar ho gai
 They are not even saying that they had said about HAL but when she got out of the deal she was surprised to hear
 unke jawaab main bahut dam nahin dikhataa he
 He also praises HAL but lacks clarity in response
 aap khud bhi unke saare jawaab ko suniye or samajhane kaa prayaas kiijie
 So how was the offset partner chosen, what was the process for its selection, did it follow, then there was a debate about the price of Rafal Biman
 ajay shukla ne bijness standard main rafaal kii keemton par teen kishton kii lambii report likhi he
 In which it has been claimed that according to the agreement reached during the Modi government, 40 percent more price is being given
 aapako pataa den ki eenai kii smita prakaash se dasso ke siio ne daawa kiya he ki deal pehle se 9 pratishat sasti he
 On August 28, Finance Minister and former Defense Minister Arun Jaitley writes on the blog that the NDA deal is 9 percent cheaper than UPA
 jetali basic aircraft ke bare main 9 pratishat sasti deal kii baat kar rahe hai
 Then Jaitley says that this aircraft is equipped according to the needs of India, which is also 20 percent less than the UPA
 dasson ke siio ne yah to kaha he ki maujuuda aircraft 9 pratishat sasta he lekin unke jawaab se saaf nahin hota ki ve basic aircraft kii baat kar rahe hai yaa phir jetali ke anusaar bharat kii jaruraton se las aircraft kii keemat kii baat kar rahe hai
 - The government has submitted the price of Rafale aircraft in a sealed envelope to the Supreme Court
 - prashanth bhushan kii daleel thi ki keemat se rashtriya suraksha ko khatra nahin he
 - All information about Rafale aircraft is public
 - sansad main bhi rafaal vimaan kii keemat bataai ja chuki he
 - Attorney General said that the price of the jet without weapons and equipment was stated in the Parliament
 - bina france kii manzuri ke puri tarah taiyaar jet kii keemat nahin bataa sakate hai
 However, on 8 March, President Macron of France told India Today that the Modi government can share the details of Rafale aircraft with the opposition
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar france kii jaankaree ke bina gopneey jaankaree saarvajanik kii gai to yah inter garvanmental agreement kaa ulanghan hoga
 The government has opposed the judicial trial of the Rafale deal
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki unhone bhi silband report nahin dekhi he
 So, can't say anything about the price
 - chif justise ne poocha ki kya 2007 kii puraani deal main bhi keemat kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya tha? - Whether information about weapons and equipment was kept confidential even at that time - atorni general ne kaha ki us vakt bhi gopneey tha
 On this Prashant Bhushan intervened and tried to show some report, but then the Chief Justice said that you did not file this report on time
 ab do ghante kii sunwaayee nahin ho sakati he
 During the hearing, KK Venugopal said that many soldiers' lives could have been saved if the Rafale aircraft were near India during the Kargil war
 is par chif justise ranjan gogoi ne atorni general ko tokate hue kaha ki kargil yuddh 1999-2000 main hua tha or rafaal vimaan 2014 main aayaa he
 Do not give such statements
 ise lekar patrakaron ke bich bhi khub sawaal jawaab ho rahe hai
 He says that the CEO of Dasso did not answer the questions correctly and could not be asked many questions

 " 15 april 2015 ko pradhanmantri modi or purv raashtrapati oland ke bich qaraar hota he
 The ceo's statement is dated 25 March 2015
 qaraar se bees din pehle kaa
 In it you read that they are saying that you can imagine my satisfaction by hearing from the Chairman of HAL
 chairman ne kaha he ki echeel is deal se judi zimmedaariyon ko uthaane ke liye taiyaar he
 Now what they say on November 13 is from Smita Prakash of ANI, read that too
 
 
 "as a supplier we were pushing to try to get the deal

 deal 126 vimaanon kii thi
 We were working with HAL and the Indian Air Force
 maine echeel ke bare main kaha tha, yah sach he
 But they are not telling how HAL got out of the deal
 ve yah bhi nahin kah rahe hai ki echeel ke bare main unhone kaha to tha magar jab wo deal se baahar ho gai to sunakar hairaani hui
 His answer does not show much power
 ve echeel kii tarif bhi karte hai lekin jawaab main spashtataa nahin he
 Listen to all their answers yourself and try to understand
 to ofaset partner kaise chunaa gaya, iske chune jane kii kya prakriya thi, kya uskaa paalan hua, phir rafaal bimaan ke daam ko lekar bahes hai
 Ajay Shukla has written a long report of three installments on Rafale prices in Business Standard
 jisamen daawa kiya he ki modi sarkaar ke samay jo qaraar hua he uske anusaar 40 pratishat adhik keemat di ja rahi he
 Let us know that Dasso CEO from ani's Smita Prakash has claimed that the deal is already 9 percent cheaper
 28 agast ko vitt mantri or purv raksha mantri arun jetali blog likhte he ki endie kii deal upie se 9 pratishat sasti he
 Jaitley is talking about 9 percent cheaper deals on basic aircraft
 phir jetali kehete hai ki bharat kii zaruuraton ke mutabik is aircraft ko las kiya jaataa he wo bhi upie kii tulana main 20 pratishat kam he
 The CEO of Dasson has said that the existing aircraft are 9 per cent cheaper but their reply does not indicate whether they are talking about basic aircraft or the price of aircraft equipped with India's needs according to Jaitley
 - sarkaar ne rafaal vimaan kii keemat silband lipaphe main supreme court ko saunpi he
 - Prashant Bhushan argued that price did not threaten national security
 - rafaal vimaan kii sari jaankariyaan saarvajanik hai
 - The price of Rafale aircraft has also been mentioned in Parliament
 - atarni general ne kaha ki sansad main bina hathiyaar va upkaran se las jet kii keemat bataai gai
 - Without the approval of France, you cannot tell the price of a fully finished jet
 vaise 8 march ko india today se france ke raashtrapati maikron ne kaha tha ki modi sarkaar chaahe to rafaal vimaan ke ditels vipaksh se saajha kar sakati he
 KK Venugopal said that if confidential information was made public without the knowledge of France, it would be a violation of the inter-governmental Agreement
 sarkaar ne rafaal deal ke nyaayik pareekshan kaa virodh kiya he
 KK Venugopal said that he too has not seen the sealed report
 isliye keemat ke bare main kuch nahin kah sakate hai
 - Chief Justice asked if the price was not disclosed in the old 2007 deal also? - kya us vakt bhi hathiyaaron va upkarnon kii jaankaree ko gopneey rakhaa gaya tha - The Attorney General said that was confidential even at that time
 is par prashanth bhushan ne hastkshep kiya or kuch report dikhaane kii koshish kii, lekin tab chif justise ne kaha ki aapane vakt par ye report daakhil nahin kii
 There can no longer be a two-hour hearing
 sunwaayee ke dauraan jab ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar rafaal vimaan kargil yuddh ke dauraan bharat ke paas hota to kai sainikon kii jaan bachaai ja sakati thi
 On this, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi intervened to the Attorney General, saying that the Kargil war took place in 1999-2000 and the Rafale aircraft arrived in 2014
 is tarah ke bayaan mat dijie
 a lot of questions are being answered even among journalists about this
 unka kahana he ki dasso ke siio ne sawaalon ke jawaab sahi nahin die or unase kai sawaal nahin puche ja sake
 Julian Boussaw, a journalist with La Monde, has raised many questions after an interview with ANI
 siio- hamane 2011 main hi reliance group se baatcheet shuru kar di thi, tab oland raashtrapati nahin the
 Modi was not the Prime Minister
 - julian- dasso kii tab mukesh ambani ke reliance group se baat ho rahi thi na ki anil ambani ke reliance group se
 It was a different company
 rafaal ke siio se puche gaye sawaal or unke jawaab
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said: Dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance

 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance , within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company Now you will read this answer again
 hansi bhi aegi or ronaa bhi aayega
 The ceo's reply suggests that he is not the CEO of Dasso Aviation, the CEO of Sattu's packing company
 main hindi main bataa rahaa hum ki siio angrezi main yah kah rahe hai ki 'hamane aage badhane kaa faisla kiya to reliance ke saath hi jude rahane kaa faisla kiya
 Both are brothers within the same group and sons of former leader Ambani, so it was in the same line, from one company or another within the group
 'tippaniyan Does the CEO of Dasso feel that people do not know English in India
 kuch bhi bol denge
 Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani separated in 2005
 ham sab jaanate hai ki mukesh ambani kii kai companiyaan hai, use reliance group kehete hai
 Anil Ambani has several companies called Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
 yani donon alag-alag group hai
 Not two different companies of one group
 mukesh ambani kaa samooh apane balanceshit main kai hazaar karod ke phaayde dikhaata he
 Anil Ambani's group is said to be in a loss of several thousand crores
 agar ye donon ek hi group ke hote to inkaa kul munafa bhi ek hota or kul ghaataa bhi ek hota
 is that so
 nahin he
 Does the CEO of Dasso Avision, who is entering into a multi-crore deal with India, not even know that Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani belong to the same group? adaalat se jo faisla aayega, wo aayega magar ye jo bayaan aa rahe hai, unka kya kiya jaae
 In response to not being experienced by Reliance, it is good to start from zero
 to dasso bataae ki usne jo tees ofaset partner chune hai usamen se kitni aisi companiyaan hai, jo anil ambani kii company kii tarah shunya se shuru kar rahi hai
 That is, those who used to make wedding marriage plates and now they have been given the contract to make parts of Rafal 
 eenai kii smita prakaash se siio trephiye kehete hai ki meri company clin he
 But in 1998 Dasso's director was sentenced to 18 months in the case of taking bribe
 usne kantrect lene ke liye 1998 main belgium ke netaaon ko rishwat di thi
 On 15 April 2015, an agreement is signed between Prime Minister Modi and former President Hollande

 We were the winner in 2012
 So we really wanted to get the deal
 And the deal was that for 126 aircraft
 So we were still working on that deal with, as i said, HAL and Indian Air Force
 It was true, as i said also, and i believe that the government of India said that it's too long and too difficult, the 126
 So go ahead with 36, supplied by Government of France
 This was exactly what happened in 2015
 " On November 13, we are saying that as a supplier we wanted this deal
 deal 126 vimaanon kii thi
 We were working with HAL and the Indian Air Force

 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said: Dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance 
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the existing Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: "but the reliance at that time was different, it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different the French President was different , you are the only one who is common 
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance , within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company Now you will read this answer again
 hansi bhi aegi or ronaa bhi aayega
 The ceo's reply suggests that he is not the CEO of Dasso Aviation, the CEO of Sattu's packing company
 main hindi main bataa rahaa hum ki siio angrezi main yah kah rahe hai ki 'hamane aage badhane kaa faisla kiya to reliance ke saath hi jude rahane kaa faisla kiya
 Both are brothers within the same group and sons of former leader Ambani, so it was in the same line, from one company or another within the group
 'tippaniyan Does the CEO of Dasso feel that people do not know English in India
 kuch bhi bol denge
 Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani separated in 2005
 ham sab jaanate hai ki mukesh ambani kii kai companiyaan hai, use reliance group kehete hai
 Anil Ambani has several companies called Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
 yani donon alag-alag group hai
 Not two different companies of one group
 mukesh ambani kaa samooh apane balanceshit main kai hazaar karod ke phaayde dikhaata he
 Anil Ambani's group is said to be in a loss of several thousand crores
 agar ye donon ek hi group ke hote to inkaa kul munafa bhi ek hota or kul ghaataa bhi ek hota
 is that so
 nahin he
 Does the CEO of Dasso Avision, who is entering into a multi-crore deal with India, not even know that Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani belong to the same group? adaalat se jo faisla aayega, wo aayega magar ye jo bayaan aa rahe hai, unka kya kiya jaae
 In response to not being experienced by Reliance, it is good to start from zero

 - All information about Rafale aircraft is public
 - sansad main bhi rafaal vimaan kii keemat bataai ja chuki he
 - Attorney General said that the price of the jet without weapons and equipment was stated in the Parliament
 - bina france kii manzuri ke puri tarah taiyaar jet kii keemat nahin bataa sakate hai
 However, on 8 March, President Macron of France told India Today that the Modi government can share the details of Rafale aircraft with the opposition
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki agar france kii jaankaree ke bina gopneey jaankaree saarvajanik kii gai to yah inter garvanmental agreement kaa ulanghan hoga
 The government has opposed the judicial trial of the Rafale deal
 ke ke venugopal ne kaha ki unhone bhi silband report nahin dekhi he
 So, can't say anything about the price
 - chif justise ne poocha ki kya 2007 kii puraani deal main bhi keemat kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya tha? - Whether information about weapons and equipment was kept confidential even at that time - atorni general ne kaha ki us vakt bhi gopneey tha
 On this Prashant Bhushan intervened and tried to show some report, but then the Chief Justice said that you did not file this report on time
 ab do ghante kii sunwaayee nahin ho sakati he
 During the hearing, KK Venugopal said that many soldiers' lives could have been saved if the Rafale aircraft were near India during the Kargil war
 is par chif justise ranjan gogoi ne atorni general ko tokate hue kaha ki kargil yuddh 1999-2000 main hua tha or rafaal vimaan 2014 main aayaa he
 Do not give such statements

 CEO- We started talking to Reliance Group in 2011, when Holland was not President

 julian-dasso was talking to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Group and not Anil Ambani's Reliance Group
 wo alag company thi
 Questions and answers to the CEO of Rafal
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said :dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that the two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the current Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: " But the reliance at that time was different , it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different, the French President was different, you are the only one who is common
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance, within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company ab aap is jawaab ko phir se padhiega
 Laughter will come and cry will also come
 siio ke is jawaab se lagata he ki ve dasso aviation ke siio nahin hai, sattu kii packing karne vaali company ke siio lagate hai
 i am telling in Hindi that the CEO is saying in English that 'we decided to move forward and decided to stay connected with Reliance
 ek hi group ke bheetar donon bhai hai or purv leader ambani ke bete hai, lihaaza yah usee line main tha, ek group ke bheetar kii ek yaa duusari company se tha
 Comments kya dasso ke siio ko ye lagata he ki bharat main logon ko angreji nahin aati he
 Will speak anything
 2005 main mukesh ambani or anil ambani alag ho gaye the
 We all know that Mukesh Ambani has many companies, it is called Reliance Group
 anil ambani kii kai companiyaan hai jise anil dhirubhai ambani group kehete hai
 That is, both are different groups
 na ki ek group kii do alag-alag companiyaan
 Mukesh Ambani's group shows the benefits of several thousand crores in its balance sheet
 anil ambani kaa group kai hazaar karod ke ghate main bataaya jaataa he
 If these two belonged to the same group, their total profit would also be one and the total loss would also be one
 kya aisa he
 Is not
 kya dasso avishan kaa siio jo bharat ke saath kai hazaar karod kaa sauda kar rahaa he, use itnaa bhi nahin maaloom he ki mukesh ambani or anil ambani ek hi group ke nahin hai
 The decision that will come from the court will come, but what should be done with these statements that are coming
 reliance ke anbhavi na hone ke jawaab main kehete hai ki shunya se shuru hona acha hota he
 So Dasso tell how many of the thirty offset partners he has chosen, which are starting from zero like Anil Ambani's company

 main hindi main bataa rahaa hum ki siio angrezi main yah kah rahe hai ki 'hamane aage badhane kaa faisla kiya to reliance ke saath hi jude rahane kaa faisla kiya
 Both are brothers within the same group and sons of former leader Ambani, so it was in the same line, from one company or another within the group
 'tippaniyan Does the CEO of Dasso feel that people do not know English in India
 kuch bhi bol denge
 Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani separated in 2005
 ham sab jaanate hai ki mukesh ambani kii kai companiyaan hai, use reliance group kehete hai
 Anil Ambani has several companies called Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
 yani donon alag-alag group hai
 Not two different companies of one group
 mukesh ambani kaa samooh apane balanceshit main kai hazaar karod ke phaayde dikhaata he
 Anil Ambani's group is said to be in a loss of several thousand crores
 agar ye donon ek hi group ke hote to inkaa kul munafa bhi ek hota or kul ghaataa bhi ek hota
 is that so
 nahin he
 Does the CEO of Dasso Avision, who is entering into a multi-crore deal with India, not even know that Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani belong to the same group? adaalat se jo faisla aayega, wo aayega magar ye jo bayaan aa rahe hai, unka kya kiya jaae
 In response to not being experienced by Reliance, it is good to start from zero
 to dasso bataae ki usne jo tees ofaset partner chune hai usamen se kitni aisi companiyaan hai, jo anil ambani kii company kii tarah shunya se shuru kar rahi hai
 That is, those who used to make wedding marriage plates and now they have been given the contract to make the parts of Rafal
 eenai kii smita prakaash se siio trephiye kehete hai ki meri company clin he
 But in 1998 Dasso's director was sentenced to 18 months in the case of taking bribe
 usne kantrect lene ke liye 1998 main belgium ke netaaon ko rishwat di thi
 On this Prashant Bhushan intervened and tried to show some report, but then the Chief Justice said that you did not file this report on time
 ab do ghante kii sunwaayee nahin ho sakati he
 During the hearing, KK Venugopal said that many soldiers' lives could have been saved if the Rafale aircraft were near India during the Kargil war
 is par chif justise ranjan gogoi ne atorni general ko tokate hue kaha ki kargil yuddh 1999-2000 main hua tha or rafaal vimaan 2014 main aayaa he
 Do not give such statements
 ise lekar patrakaron ke bich bhi khub sawaal jawaab ho rahe hai
 He says that the CEO of Dasso did not answer the questions correctly and could not be asked many questions
 laa mond ke ek patrkaar hai julian bassow ne eenai ko die intervyuu ke baad kai sawaal uthaae hai

 Questions and answers to the CEO of Rafal
 
 
 Question: "the reason i am asking this because the former president Holland said :dassault was not given an option, they had to pic the off set partners which the Indian govt told them whereas the Indian govt says that nothing of that sort happened" Answer: "it's totally untrue and that the former president Holland made a correction of what he said, he said clearly that the two partners found themselves together so it not at all the decision of french govt or the govt of India that Dassault selected Reliance
 i have good example, if i started discussion with reliance group in 2011
 in 2100 president was not Holland in France and the Prime Minister in India was different from the current Prime Minister of today
 we set an agreement in 2012
 " Question: " But the reliance at that time was different , it was the other brother so i mean the president was different the only common factor is you
 i mean the Prime Minister was different, the French President was different, you are the only one who is common
 " Answer- "that's what i said that we decided to go ahead we decided to hoop with reliance, within the group as they are two brothers and the son of the former leader Ambani so it was totally in line it was in a group with one or the other company ab aap is jawaab ko phir se padhiega
 Laughter will come and cry will also come
 siio ke is jawaab se lagata he ki ve dasso aviation ke siio nahin hai, sattu kii packing karne vaali company ke siio lagate hai
 i am telling in Hindi that the CEO is saying in English that 'we decided to move forward and decided to stay connected with Reliance
 ek hi group ke bheetar donon bhai hai or purv leader ambani ke bete hai, lihaaza yah usee line main tha, ek group ke bheetar kii ek yaa duusari company se tha

 anil ambani kaa group kai hazaar karod ke ghate main bataaya jaataa he
 If these two belonged to the same group, their total profit would also be one and the total loss would also be one
 kya aisa he
 Is not
 kya dasso avishan kaa siio jo bharat ke saath kai hazaar karod kaa sauda kar rahaa he, use itnaa bhi nahin maaloom he ki mukesh ambani or anil ambani ek hi group ke nahin hai
 The decision that will come from the court will come, but what should be done with these statements that are coming
 reliance ke anbhavi na hone ke jawaab main kehete hai ki shunya se shuru hona acha hota he
 So Dasso tell how many of the thirty offset partners he has chosen, which are starting from zero like Anil Ambani's company
 yani jo pehle shaadi byaah ke plate banaati thim or ab unhen rafaal ke kal purze banane kaa theka diya gaya he
 CEO Trafiye from Smita Prakash of ANI says that my company is clean

 Janu is born in a Muslim family, but she is more interested in the things of the priest of the temple
 wo aksar pujari ji (najim khan ) ke saath baithkar ghanto baaten karata rahata he
 Sometimes he plays the role of Hanuman in Ramlila, sometimes he is lost after listening to the discourse of river Ganga
 jab is baat kaa ilm uske walid maulavee sahab ko padataa he to vah bahut gussa hote hai
 Due to this, Janu is also beaten

 If you believe in emotional films and believe in a straightforward story, then this is definitely a film of your meaning

 manila or jakarta main adhikariyon ke bich yahi aam raay he ki unke yahaan bharat kii chhavi bahut acchhee he—jo aisihasik or saanskrithik samparkon par aadhaarit he—lekin vah uskaa phayda nahin uthaa paaya he
 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Manila on November 12 for the East Asia Summit and the 25th india-asean Summit, he will try to change this aspect
 manmohan singh sarkaar ne bharat kii ''purab kii ore dekho" niti main kuch had tak josh bharaa or 2009 main asian-bharat mukt vyapaar kshetra naamak samjhauta kiya tha
 Firstly P
 ve
 This policy was initiated by Narasimha Rao in 1991
 modi sarkaar ne bade uddeshy ke liye is niti main sudhaar karte hue ise ''purab main kaam karo" main badal diya he
 The Prime Minister has invited all 10 ASEAN leaders to watch the Republic Day parade in January
 modi sarkaar 3,200 kimi lambey moreh se bharat-myanmar-thailand hive ke nirmaan par teji se kaam kar rahi he, jisaki pariklpana saal 2002 main kii gai thi
 This will bring ASEAN countries closer to India
 (beijing pehle hi bangkok or singapore ko jodgaye vaale kunming se bullate train chalaane kii pariyojna par kaam kar rahaa he)
 The biggest change is that the Modi government alone understood its limitations of "working in the east"
 modi is kshetra ke saath apane rishte banane ke maamle main tokyo or washington kii taraf jhukne main koi sankoch karte nahin dikh rahe or china kii samvednaaon ko zyada tavajjo nahin de rahe hai
 It also looks logical
 japan or america ke saath asian ke sambandhon ko dekha jaae to yah kshetra china par bahut kam nirbhar najar aata he
 The region's total trade with India, Japan ($ 239 billion) and the US ($ 212 billion) is one-and-a-half times the total trade with China
 trump sarkaar ne is kshetra main bharat ko apana mahatvapurn saajheedaar mana or apni asia niti ko ''ek swatantra or khulaa indo-pacific kshetra" bataaya
 This is a more comprehensive policy than the "asia axis" policy of the Obama administration
 manila main teen desh or australia 2007 ke baad se apni pehali baithak karenge
 At that time, due to strong opposition from China, the four-party negotiations had to be stopped
 ab yah dekhne kii baat hogi ki yah najdiki kya suraksha sahyog ke maamle tak simit rahegi yaa china kaa aarthik vikalp banegi
 Beijing is closely watching this change
 shi jinping ke pehle kaarykaal main beijing ke saamne koi pratispardhi nahin tha
 He had then strengthened his military strength with activities such as "island building" in the South China Sea and thwarted joint efforts of ASEAN countries with his efficient diplomacy
 usne philippines ke saath apane rishton ko sudhara or vietnam ke saath paidaa daraar ko bhi paatane kii disha main bhi kaam kiya
 At the same time it was also increasing its business
 is bich donald trump ne apni sarkaar banate hi pehle kadam ke taur par trans-pacific partnership samjhaute se khud ko alag kar liya tha
 This agreement was the biggest effort ever to respond to China's economic dominance
 beijing main aam raay he ki trump aakhirkaar bharat ke gaiyr-bharosemand saathi sabit honge
 Beijing's chief strategist Shane Dingli says, "trump's indo-pacific strategy is not going to help
" indo-pacific hameshaa mukt or khulaa rahaa he
 Samandars cannot be divided
 china hind mahaasaagar kaa khilaadi he, or hind mahaasaagar kisi kaa nahin he, chaahe china ho, bharat yaa america
 Trump's good works will ruin Trump's and Trump's later US president

 Suresh Kalmadi, the chairman of the organizing committee, who is facing immense pressure to organize a successful Commonwealth Games next year, said that the Indian government has not isolated him and he sees no reason to resign from his post

 unhone is baat ko khaarij kar diya ki aayojan samiti main kuch nayi niyuktiyon main unhen alag thalag kar diya gaya
 He said, "let me make it clear to you that the government is fully supporting me, all the officers have been appointed only after my request and i have also asked many people of the army to join the sports
" kalmari ne kaha, 'sena se lagbhag 50 log jud rahe hai or hamane saarvajanik udhyamon, nijee kshetron or sarkaar se bhi logon ko dene ke liye kaha he, ve vahi kaam karenge jo ve kar sakate hai

 Instead, both sides worked on an acceptable formula, although they did not elaborate
 kalmari ne kaha, yah sahi nahin he
 i do not want to comment further on this
 donon pakshon ke liye yah ek haath se dene or duusare se lene jaisi baat rahi or hamaare bich samjhauta ho gaya he
 When Kalmadi was asked if he agreed with Fennell's demand to set up an independent panel to progress the construction work, he refused to talk on the issue
 unhone kaha 'main is masale par baat nahin karnaa chahta hum kyonki yah sulajhaa liya gaya he
 There is a coordination commission for this and all decisions will be taken only after its arrival
 hamaari fennell ke saath ek or baithak hogi jisamen in sabhi baton par faisla kiya jayega
 Kalmadi, however, admitted that more foreign experts were appointed in line with Fennell's demand, but made it clear that they belong to the same areas in which India did not have expertise
 unhone kaha 'hamaare paas pehle se videshi visheshgy kaam kar rahe the

 input language input- bhashaa When Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati stood up to speak in the Rajya Sabha on December 6 during a debate on retail FDI, Kamal Nath already knew what she was going to say
 kendriya sansadeey kaarymantri pichhali raat hi bispi pramukh se mulaakaat kar chuke the
 She was planning to abstain from voting in the Rajya Sabha
 mayawati, bispi netaa satish chandra mishra or kamalnath ke bich yah mulaakaat aadhi raat tak chali
 The next morning, Kamal Nath, wearing a dark blue safari suit, came to the Parliament in a long sting full of confidence
 bispi kaa vot surakshit rup se unke pocket main tha or unhone yah acchhee khabar pradhanmantri ko sunai
 Apart from the Prime Minister, only Sonia Gandhi knew that she had cast her vote
 neshnal conference ke netaa farukh abdulla ne india today se kaha, ''main nahin samajhataa ki kamalnath ne jo kiya he, vah koi or kar saktaa tha
 He kept struggling till midnight and no one knew what he was doing
 ''vipaksh, jo kuch minute pehle tak patrakaron ko bataa rahaa tha ki epadi vot par sarkaar haar jaaegi, vah darasal sota hi rah gaya
 It was astonishing and a moment to mark Kamal Nath's political prowess
 vaise to 5 disambar ko hi loksabhaa main hue matdaan main upie jeet chukaa tha, lekin kamalnath yah jaanate the ki rajyasabha ke saansad zyada jokhim paidaa kar sakate hai
 It was necessary for the UPA to vote in favor of the BSP or Samajwadi Party (SP) government, not to go out of the vote as they had done in the lower house
 isiilie vah shighrata se mayawati ke ghar kii ore bad chale
 The BSP leader said in the House, "if the opposition's proposal (against FDI) goes ahead, another political issue will be found to disrupt the House and many important bills like reservation for SC / ST in private sector jobs
 Will not be able to pass
 ''kamalnath is maamle ko itane behatar tareeke se pesh nahin kar pate
 After Mayawati, AIADMK leader v Maitreyan dismounted and said, "if the government wins, it will be a victory for maneuver
" '' rajyasabha main jeet ke baad weekend main kamalnath ne essi / asti bill ko sansad main aage badha diya
 The Prime Minister has finally found a new troubleshooter in place of Pranab Mukherjee
 tatkaaleen sansadeey kaarymantri pawan kumaar bansal utane vajandaar netaa nahin the
 Similarly, Sushil Kumar Shinde, who replaced Mukherjee as the new Leader of the House last August, was also ineffective
 manmohan singh ko aise vyakti kii jarurat thi, jo mukherjee kii tarah har party se raajnneetik tol-mol kar sake or arthshaastra par bhi jisaki acchhee pakad ho
 In this case, most of the leaders were weak
 'cabinet kii e-suchi' kaa koi bhi netaa is bill ko manage karne ke liye upyukt nahin lag rahaa tha
 Finance Minister P
 chidambaram main sanjidagi he, lekin unke gathbandhan dalon se ghanishtha tallukaat nahin hai
 Probably only because of loyalty to 10 Janpath
 ke
 Antony got the Ministry of Defense and Shinde got the Home Ministry, but they are not able to go much further in talks with regional parties
 pradhanmantri ko pataa tha ki unhen is manamohak cirkil se pare dekhnaa hoga
 After this, the eye went to Kamal Nath, who had been neglected most of the time during UPA 2's tenure
 jeet ke lihaaj se dekhen to 66 varshiya kamalnath loksabhaa ke sabase varisht netaaon main se hai
 In this case, only CPI (M) leader Basudeb Acharya is ahead of them
 kamalnath puraane congressi hai, jo sanjay gandhi ke jamaane kii yuvak congress se ubharkar aae hai
 They have known Mayawati since the time of Kanshi Ram
 1980 main indira gandhi ke samay unhone gathbandhan ke liye diemke se baatcheet kii thi or 2004 main diemke ko upie se jodgaye main bhi unki mahatvapurn bhoomika thi
 He has seen Mamata Banerjee becoming a chief minister from a courageous street-struggling leader and has studied school with Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik
 kamalnath jab kisi sahyogi dal ko phone milaate hai to unhen pataa hota he ki koun-sa lahaza kaam aayega
 He has definitely passed his first floor test
 epadi kii jeet se na keval nath kaa profile badha he, balki sarkaar kaa hausala bhi
 This has given the UPA the impetus to implement its reform agenda
 beemaa main epadi kii seemaa ko badhaane vaale bill ke alaava, jis par bijepi or congress ko abhi apane matbhed dur karne hai, sarkaar ko bharosa he ki aane vaale bajet satr main aarthik sudhaar ke vidheyakon ko aage badha sakegi
 Now there is an atmosphere of feel-good in the Congress, which was not visible on the first day of the beginning of the winter session of Parliament
 yahaan tak ki walmart dwaara ghoose dene ke vipaksh ke naveenatam aaropon ne bhi party ke utsaah ko kam nahin kiya he
 Nath immediately declared an inquiry into the matter and neutralized the sting of the opposition, while many of his party leaders like Chidambaram and Kapil Sibal were warning that it would send a wrong message to global investors
 utsahit kamalnath takaraav se ji churaane ke mood main bilkul nahin hai
 He had run the ground well before the start of the winter session and had done his homework, persuading the Prime Minister that he was SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati and BJP leaders Invite for a separate dinner and lunch
 pehali baar gathbandhan dalon or mukhya vipakshi party ko alag-alag bulaakar samarthan maanga gaya or iske liye sarvadaleey baithak yaa upie kii baithak nahin kii gai
 Nath had also invited another ally and old friend Farooq Abdullah at the 9 November dinner with the SP
 iske peeche soch yah thi ki yadav netaaon ko epadi ke phaayde samajhane ke liye ek muslim chehre kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 Kamal Nath convinced both the SP and the BSP that the shopkeeper lobby was committed to the BJP, so supporting FDI would not affect their vote bank
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne gaiyr iradatan kamalnath ko sabase upyukt sammaan de diya, jab unhone sadan main kaha, ''jin 18 partiyon se baat kii gai unamem se sirf chaar ne khudara main epadi kaa samarthan kiya he
 Despite this, the UPA won the election
 bijepi ko kamalnath ke ankaganit se nahin balki unke bijganit se chintit hona chahie
 After watching such a floor show in Kamal Nath's Parliament, a cabinet minister laughed, "why didn't we think of making him the first Minister of Parliamentary Affairs?" "congress general secretary Digvijay Singh says," Kamal Nath is someone you cannot ignore
 yadi unhen koi kaam saunpa jaataa he to vah use puraa karte hai
 In the last few days, both his understanding power and networking skills have been proved
 ''abhi tak kamalnath ko mahatvapurn mantralay to mili the, lekin chotii ke mantralay nahin
 He must have been apprehensive that a new leader like Sibal was already included in the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs before him
 lekin dhire-dhire manmohan singh ko yah baat samaj main aa gai he ki kapil sibbal yaa salmaan khurshid ke bahes karne ke kaushal se nahin, balki kamalnath ke rajnatik kaushal se hi sarkaar ko maujuuda sankat se baahar nikaala ja saktaa he

 lekin lau and order banaae rakhane kii zimmedaari dilli police kii he
 We have sought data from the Excise Department on how many penalties have been committed in such cases so far
 kahin na kahin dilli police or aabkaari vibhaag donon kaa sangrakshan he
 But the number of Delhi Police is 66 thousand and the Excise Department has 60 officers, so the responsibility of Delhi Police becomes more

 June 29: Second T20, Malahide 2ji spectrum ke liye nilaamee kaa doosraa din buudhvaar subah 9:00 baje shuru hua
 Demand for spectrum has increased in Bihar Telecom Circle
 doorsanchaar vibhaag ke ek adhikari ne puche jane par kaha, ‘haa, aathvaan daur pragati par he
 '1 in each circle
 25 megahertz vaale spectrum ke 8 blokon kii nilaamee kar rahi he
 According to the data made public, in the last round on the first day (november 12) only bids were made for spectrum in Bihar Circle
 5 doorsanchaar companiyon bharti airtel, vodaphone, telenor pravartit televings, videocone or idia cellular ne nilaamee main bhagidaari ke liye aavedan kiya tha
 Due to the high base price of Rs 14,000 crore for 5 mhz spectrum at an all-india level, telecom companies received a lukewarm response on the first day of the auction and there was no exposure of spectrum for Delhi, Mumbai, Karnataka and Rajasthan
 suprasiddh sahityakar, sampadak or bacchon ke priy lekhak prakaash manu ne kai dashakon main faili lekhan yatra ke bich dheron kaam kiye or sahitya jagat ko samrudh kiya
 His writings include memoirs, research, interviews, fiction, poetry, articles, etc
 hindi ke is suprasiddh sahityakar or bacchon ke priy lekhak prakaash manu kaa jivan kai tarah ke jhanjhawaton, oobad-khabad raaston or pagarhndiyon se gujara he
 He has understood the essence of life while traversing through those dusty paths, while at the same time the core of Indianism, Indian culture and traditions, which have nurtured him from within and gradually he progressed on the path of being a writer
 'meri aatmakatha: raste or pagarhndiyaan' prakaash manu kii aatmakatha kaa pehla khand he, jisamen unke bachapan, kishoravastha or tarunai kii josh-kharosh bhari hulchalon kaa zikr he
 On the one hand, he has seen with great condolences the intransigence and introspection of his infancy, on the other hand, taking a step forward with childhood, with countless stories and stories about how many threads are wrapped
 par iske saath hi unhone maan, pita, bhai-bahan, us daur ke mitron, apane priy adhyapakon or anya athmiya janon ko bhi bade prem se yaad kiya he, jinaki chal-chal karti smritiyaan is puri aatmakatha main bikhri hai
 Apparently, Prakash Manu is not alone in his autobiography, but it has the full flow of his life, time, traditions and a lot of new things are being created spontaneously between them
 is tarah 'meri aatmakatha: raste or pagarhndiyaan' prakaash manu ke saath-saath unke samay kii bhi katha he
 It may not be very big events in this autobiography, but threads of fine sensations and memories are scattered throughout the autobiography
 manu ji ne unhen karine se sanjokar ek biihat katha main dhaala he, jiskaa koi ore-chor nahin he
 Therefore, this autobiography is true, it is a story of life, a story of open expansion of life, in which every chapter has its own different juices, colors and tastes
 ‘meri aatmakatha: raste or pagarhndiyaan’ prakaash manu ke lekhak hone kii kahani bhi he
 Since childhood, he was isolated from others and spent hours thinking about small things
 kisse-kahaniyon main unki akut dilchaspee thi or kahani ke pankhons par udate hue ve sapane bunate the, is duniya ko badalane or kuch kar guzarane ke sapane
 Perhaps this is what made him a writer and prepared him from within to choose a different way of life
 barason pehle ek saahitiyik mitra ne unase sawaal poocha tha, 'prakaash manu ji, aap lekhak kaise ho gaye? aapke aasapaas koun si aisi cheez thi, jo aapako lekhak bana rahi thi?' iskaa jawaab bhi shaayad yah aatmakatha hi he'aashaa he, desh ke kone-kone main faile prakaash manu ji ke pathakon ko unki is aatmakatha se rachanaatmak santosh or tripti milegi
 Also, it will be enthusiastically welcomed in the literary world
 yaad rahe ki is aatmakatha se pehle prakashit unki charchit kritiyon main upanyaas; 'yah jo dilli he', 'katha sarkas', 'papa ke jane ke baad' ke alaava kahani sankalan; 'ankal ko vish nahin karoge', 'sucraat mere shahar main', 'arundhati udhaas he', 'jindginama ek jeniyas kaa', 'tum kahan ho naveen bhai', 'misses majumdaar', 'mini bas', 'dilawar khadaa he', 'meri shreshth kahaniyaan', 'meri ektis kahaniyaan', '21 shreshth kahaniyaan', 'prakaash manu kii lokapriy kahaniyaan' or 'meri katha-yatra' shaamil he
 Prakash Manu enriched Hindi literature in addition to fiction, poems, memoirs, interviews, criticism and thought-provoking writing related to literary history
 unke kavy sankalan; 'ek or prarthana', 'chhutata hua ghar', 'kavita or kavita ke bich' naam se chape, to hindi ke diggaj sahityakaron ke lambey, anaupchaarik intervyuuj kii kitaab ‘mulaakaat’ bahucharchit rahi
 Memoirs of top Hindi literature in 'yaadon Ka Karwaan'
 devendra satyaarthee, ramvilas sharma, shailesh matiani, ramdarsh mishra tathaa vishnu khare ke vyaktitv or saahitiyik avdaan par gambhir moolyankanparak pustaken
 In addition to monographs on Devendra Satyarthi and Vishnu Prabhakar for Sahitya Akademi, the entire biography of Satyarthi ji 'devendra Satyarthi: Ek Safarnama' was published from the publishing department
 iske alaava ‘beesvin shatabdi ke ant main upanyaas: ek pathak ke nots’ aalochana main li se hatakar ek alag tarah kii pustak he
 Prakash Manu's vast composition includes more than a hundred books of children's literature, which were highly appreciated by the children and scholars of children's literature
 aisi rachanaaon main ‘meri sampurna bal kahaniyaan’ (teen khand), ‘meri sampurna bal kavitaayen’ tathaa ‘mere sampurna bal naatak’ (do khand) sareekhe brihat bal sahitya sanchayan shaamil he
 He wrote the first systematic history of children's literature in Hindi, 'history of Hindi children's literature'
 iske alaava ‘hindi bal kavita kaa itihaas’, ‘hindi bal sahitya ke shikhar vyaktitv’, ‘hindi bal sahitya ke nirmaataa’ or ‘hindi bal sahitya: nai chunautiyaan or sambhaavnaayen’ pustaken likhin
 He edited and collected many important books
 unki kai pustakon kaa punjabi, sindhi, marathi, kannada samet anya bhartiya bhashaaon main anuwaad ho chukaa he
 One special thing is that Prakash Manu's original name is Chandraprakash Vig, but except government documents, his name is hardly in circulation
 manu ne isi naam se likhaa or kai puraskaar bhi jite
 He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi's first Children's Literature Award on his child novel 'ek Tha Thunthuniya'
 iske alaava uttar pradesh hindi santhaan ke ‘bal sahitya bharti puraskaar’ or hindi academy ke ‘sahityakar sammaan’ se bhi sammanit hue
 He also received the first Girijakumar Mathur Smriti Award for his collection of poems 'ghatta Ghar'
 sahitya ajtak par sadyah prakashit unki aatmakatha ke pehle khand- 'meri aatmakatha: raste or pagarhndiyaan' kaa anshatmakatha anshah maan kii ve mamtalu ankhen- prakaash manumaan ko yaad karata hoon to sabase pehle unki ankhen yaad aati hai
 The eyes that had the naivety of a child and the incessant curiosity to know and understand
 isiilie ham apane tain koi saadhaaran-si baat bhi kehete, to maan kii utsuk ankhen fail jaatin
 She would try to understand it for a while with her 'common sense' and then the next moment she would say in a surprised voice, "hacha
 
 
 !"isiilie maan thim to jivan main koi banaavat nahin thi, jivan main koi jatilta yaa asahajata nahin thi
 There was no fear in life
 maan, maan thim to aasthaa kaa samandar bhi
 Life used to be there
 kuch arsa pehle ‘kathadesh’ main garsiya gabriel marces kaa intervyuu pard rahaa tha, jiskaa khubasurat anuwaad mangalesh dabraal ne kiya he
 He has said some amazing things especially about women
 unheen main se ek baat yah bhi he ki ye striyaan hi hai jo jivan ko thame rahati hai
 What is it to hold life and how do women do it? Looking at this, i remembered my mother
 kaise ek baarik, bahut baarik or adrishy taar se unhone hamaare puure ghar ko joda hua tha or kaise us baarik taar ke na rahane par bahut kuch tinkaa-tinkaa hokar bikhar gaya! ise yaad karata hoon to phir maan kaa hona bahut-bahut yaad aata he
 Thus, in the literature of all the languages of the world, especially folk literature, nothing less was said about this mother
 lambii dadhi or jindadilii se bharpoor hamaare ghumantu sahityakar satyaarthee ji akasar ek puraani kahawat doharaaya karte the ki ishwar ne maanen banaain, kyonki vah sab jagah upasthit nahin rah saktaa tha
 i think that there is hardly anything more to be said about mother
 sach to yah he ki mujhe ishwar par bhi bharosa isliye he ki maine maan ko dekha he
 Looks like the person who made my mother, it must be something! That would be really great! Faith, faith, gentleness and all the good things in life are because the mother is there and she is present in our whole life, even if she is not there! The novel 'doodh-gachh' is the central idea or 'signature tune'
 ek or dilachasp baat yah he ki ‘doodh-gachh’ upanyaas main doodh-gachh maan ke liye hi aayaa he, yani ki maan jo ‘doodh kaa ped’ bhi he- puri duniya ko trupt karne ke liye uga doodh kaa darkht! sachmuch yah kalpana hi anokhi he
 Being a mother in this world is also really unique
 maan na hoti to yah duniya na itani khubasurat hoti, na anokhi or na itane baarik, parat-dar-parat rahasyon se bhari!*maan kii chhaviyaan bachapan kii un nihaayat maasoom or dhundhbhari paraton tak faili hai jab mujhe apane or aasapaas kii shaayad hi koi chetana rahi ho
 But it was still felt to be a mother
 maan kii baaten tab bhi acchhee lagati thim
 Probably because these things were not just things
 ye wo pyaara-sa tinakon kaa ghonslaa thim, jisamen sir chhipaae-chhipaae, aasapaas ke dher saare janjaalon se bachataa hua, main dhire-dhire bada ho rahaa tha
 When Mother was talking to neighbors and friends, i remember very well, as a young, curious child, i entered into that circle and listened carefully to Mother's words
 kukku bachapan main meraa gharelu naam tha
 The name of calling with love
 to maan or saheliyaan kai baar katakshapurn hansee hanste hue baraj bhi diya karti thim ki "oe kukku! tu kya sun rahaa he? tujko kya samaj main aaengi ye auraton kii baaten!"or ve baaten kya hua karti thim, ‘neen shanie, jad meraa kukku hoya si
 
 
 ! ' Or 'jis Wale Mera Shyam Hoya'
 
 
 !’ yaa meraa ‘meraa kishan, jagan haale chota-jya si
 
 
 ! ' And then, what crises came or what amazing things happened, that was the essence of all the stories that were called 'women's things'
 unheen ke bare main maan apni sathin striyon se ghanton tak batiyaati rah sakati thim or garmi kii lambii-lambii dopahariyaan or shaamein sukh-dukh kii in sahaj-sahaj baton ke jaal main ulajhakar kaise udan-chhu ho jaati thim, yah aaj bhi mujhe kisi aashcharya kii naayee lagata he!or itani hi aashcharya kii baat yah bhi lagati he ki mujh ek nanhe bachche ko in baton main aisi kya akut dilchaspee thi ki baaten samaj main aaen yaa na aaen, magar vah khatm hone main na aati thi
 And i would listen to those things, and drink instead, with my eyes outstretched
 mere liye dilchaspee kii baat yahi thi ki ve maan kii baaten thim! par maan or unki saheliyaan jab itane gaur se mujhe baaten sunate dekhati thim, to hanskar tok diya karti thim, "chal-chal pare hat! tuun kii sun reya en!" (chalo-chalo, dur hato
 What are you listening to?) Very little memory
 maan sir par kapadon kii badi si gathree rakhe, talab par kapade dhone ja rahi hai or main saath hoon
 My mother is washing clothes by rubbing on the stone lying on the banks of the pond and i am happy to break the beautiful yellow flowers and yellow runes on the ridge of fields
 un dinon jaanata kam tha, lekin chijen mahasoos khub hoti thim
 For example, what is the pleasure of running and playing in the lukewarm sun of winter, it felt very well and also the intimate beauty of nature! The mind was full of excitement, "oh wow, what mustard has grown so much in the fields around the pond! And not only mustard yellow flowers, the smell of it also has a frill around it , As if the whole surrounding environment is transformed into a wonderful festival
 "yaad he, us din koi chaar baras kii umr main maine prakruti ke anant vistaar kii anubhuti kii thi
 i felt that my heart has become very big by spreading and a lot of it is going on
 yahan tak ki puraa kaa puraa talab, aasapaas ke lah-lah karte khet or pile phulon vaali junglee jhaadiyaan bhi
 This was probably the first little poem born in an infant's mind
 ek or purana lekin gaharaa-gaharaa-sa chitra
 Mother is going to worship 'gugga' ie 'goga Pir' or say village deity near the pond, with a doll (small balls of flour) dipped in molasses molasses in a dolu
 puja ke baad gud ke shire main dubi hui doiyaan milti hai or mujhe lagata he, isse adhik swaadisht cheez duniya main koi or nahin he
 i ask for more dough
 maan meri katori main dher sara shira or do-ek doiyaan rakh detii he or mujhe lagata he, duniya sachmuch kitni khubasurat or swaad bhari he!yaad aata he, maan nahaate samay kuch panktiyaan doharaaya karti thim
 There were definitely two lines in it, "take a bath of the filthy filth, don't get a woman's feet
" 
 
 !" maan baar-baar in panktiyon ko doharaati thim, maano inhen baar-baar doharaana hi unhen kisi ‘mukti aashwaasan’ kii tarah lagata ho
 The life of a woman is painful, but instead of changing it, she should just pray, perhaps this may have been the 'truth' of the mother's part! There may be a limit to this truth, but mother's practice of realizing this truth had no limit
 yon maan kaa jivan dukh, niraashaa yaa kisi kism kii hinata se malin na tha
 She was a kamari and enthusiastically welcomed the new day
 yaad aati he koi aadhi sadi se bhi adhik puraani sardiyon kii subah
 We were small then
 badi bhor main uthakar, abhi ham bistar par hi hote the ki maan kisi chidiya kii tarah dhime-dhime gun-gun karke ek geet ched detii thim
 And we inadvertently started repeating it
 sachmuch badi mithaas thi in geet main or yah ek mithi or utsaah bhari bhor ke swaagat-gaan sa lagata tha-uth jaag savere!guraan da dhyaan,ganga ishnaan
 Hath wich lotta, modhe loi, Ram ji the Goansita di kitchen
 
 
 !(utho, badi subah-savere uth jaao
 Meditate and take bath in the Ganges
 haath main lotaa or kandhe par dushaala
 Ram ji is feeding the cows and Mother Sita is preparing the kitchen
 )geet kya tha, maano hindustani daanpaty kaa adarsh saamne rakhaa gaya tha
 a simple picture of a hard-working life
 
 
 
 It was a long song
 dhire-dhire badi aaramdaari kii-si sahaj, manthar lay main aage badhata hua
 And in this, i used to come a line which i used to like very dear, "chidiya v Chunagun Laya e, Uth, awake morning !!" (sparrows have also started chunagun raga
 badi subah-savere uth jaao
 ) Similarly, i remember that i got to hear Gayatri mantra from my mother first too
 balki sardiyon kii ek subah, maan ne apni mithi, kharkhri aawaaj main mujhe yah mantra acchhee tarah yaad kara diya tha
 Today, when i have heard a lot from the Kashmiri brother-in-law about Nana ji's extraordinary personality, i can imagine how my scholar Nana ji must have reminded this Gayatri Mantra to his mother! And when the same mantra from mother came to me with some magical effect, it was as if the maternal grandfather was reminding me of that mantra! This is the eternal mantra for the development of life
 or yah jitna sidhaa-saral he, utana hi rahasyamay bhi!*maan kii sunai kahaniyon kii bhi mujhe khub acchhee tarah yaad he
 One of them was the story of 'adhku', which had a great impact on me
 haalaanki yah kahani shaayad jas kii tas mujhe yaad nahin rah gai
 i have included this story in a different way in my child stories book 'ikyavan Bal Kahaniyan'
 pichley dinon kashmiri bhaisahab meri bal kahaniyon kii kitaab padhakar is kahani kii charchaa kar rahe the, to ekaek unki bade joro kii hansee chhot gai
 Obviously, while reading this story, they too must have descended the steps of their childhood and gone into the magical world of childhood! Perhaps this is the effect of stories heard from mother in childhood
 isi tarah maan se suni kahaniyon main ek thi saat kothriyon vaali kahani
 The prince is asked to see the six chambers of this palace, but not the seventh
 varanaa vah museebaton main fas jayega
 The prince sees six cells, but then cannot stop himself from seeing the seventh cell
 hone do jo hota he, par ek baar to main dekhakar rahoonga ki kya he saatvin kothri main? vah sochataa he
 Stubbornness is determined or sachmuch saatvin kothri main pravesh ke saath hi mushkilen ek ke baad ek bhayankar aandhi, pani, tufaan kii tarah- yaa phir ek bheeshan panjon vaale giddh kii tarah us par tut padati hai
 But he does not lose courage, faces them bravely and finally one day he is seen standing on the highest peak of success
 
 
 
 Hearing this story from my mother, it seemed that whatever happens, i will also go to the seventh room and see what secret is hidden there
 phir chaahe jiuun yaa marun! tab chaahe na sochaa ho, par ab kai baar main hairaan hokar sochataa hoon- to kya sahitya kii duniya main aana vahi saatvin kothri main jhaankana he jisamen rahasy hi rahasy bhare pade hai or apni tarah ke ‘khatre’ bhi? main hairaani se sochataa hoon or bade tajjub se bhar jaataa hoon ki ek hi kahani agar vah sachmuch ji lagaakar suni-sunai gai ho, to kitne logon ke liye kitne bhinn aashay khol sakati he
 Perhaps this is the strength of stories heard in childhood
 hamaari maanen shaayad isi tarah sadiyon se buraai par achchhai kii vijay kaa mantra hamen pilaati rahi hai! bhale hi iskaa mahatv bahut ‘angreji’ padhe samaajavigyaniyon ko abhi thik-thik samaj main na aayaa ho!or mere liye to yah atirikt sukh kii tarah he ki maan apni sunai kahaniyon main chhipi hui hai
 When wanted, go there and see and hear them
 
 
 
 There were two or two stories in the stories of mother, through which mother may have wanted to share with us the problem of being a mother or a woman, or that she wanted to teach a kind of lesson
 inamen ek kahani main betaa jo ab acha kamaane-dhamane laga he, bada hone par maan ke tyaag kaa mol chukaana chahta he
 He repeatedly asks, "speak no mother, what shall i bring for you?" Mother keeps quiet
 bahut poochne par hanskar kah detii he, "rahane de betaa, kyon takalif jhelta he?" bete ke bahut jid karne par maan aakhirkaar kahati he ki acha betaa, samay aane par kahoongi
 On the same night, when the son slept, the mother put a little water from the lotus on his bed
 ladkaa hadabadaakar uthaa
 Asked, "mother
 
 
 maan, yah kya?" maan boli, "pataa nahin betaa, mujhase kaise gir gaya
 Well, don't worry, go to sleep! "the boy was asleep when his mother again spilled water
 ab to vah buree tarah khij uthaa
 Shouted, "mother, will you let me sleep today or not?" At this, the mother said in a very mamtalu voice, "sleep peacefully son, but remember one thing
 jab tu chota tha to raat main na jane kitni baar tu peshaab karata tha
 But i used to put you to sleep in the dry, sleep myself in the wet
 kabhi gussa nahin aata tha
 But you son, got upset twice
 to bhala maan kaa rin tu kaise utaaregaa?"kahani sunate hue us bete par bada gussa aayaa tha jo jaraa si der main maan par jhalla padaa tha
 i thought, i will not be such a son
 par kya main sachmuch ek acha betaa ban sakaa? aaj sochataa hoon to apane upar shame aati he
 Many stories of mother also had wonderful fantasy
 masalan maan kii ek kahani hajaaron saal pehle kii us ascharyajanak ‘aadim’ duniya kii kahani thi jisamen log apane sir ko handiya kii tarah utarkar god main rakh lete the ore juen binte the
 Especially women had the opportunity to pick up lice in peace
 dhoop main baithe-baithe maje main juunen binte raho
 But then there was a mess
 sachmuch ajeeb gadabadjhaalaa! hua yah he ki ek stri aisa karte hue, gharelu vyasttaaon main apane sir ko kahin idhar-udhar rakhkar bhul gai or duusare kaamon main lag gai
 The monkey came from behind and lifted his head
 ab vah stri yahan-vahaan apana sir found rahi he, magar sir he ki mil hi nahin rahaa
 Then it turned out that the head is in front of the monkey sitting on the tree in front of him, who after a lot of supplication, barely agreed to give it to him
 us din ke baad se bhagwaan ne apni sristi main tabdili kii or tab se sabake sir pakke jude hone lage
 
 
 
 maan kii bholi duniya kaa ek bholaa sach!alabatta yah handiya kii tarah sir ko godi main rakhkar juen binane kii kalpana aisi mjedaar thi ki hanste-hanste ham lotpot ho jate
 And even today when i think about this fantasy, i do not live without laughter
 isi tarah ek mjedaar kahani thi ‘githmuthiye’ kii
 One more fantasy of fantasy! Because this story was also about amazing creatures living in a wonderful world
 githmuthiye maane aise log jo khadey hon to ek ‘gith’ yani baalist bhar ke hon ore baithen to ek mutthi bhar ke! aise log pataal se nikalakar dharti par aate the or phir kya-kya na ho jaataa tha! magar ek baat tay thi ki ye koi bure log na the
 There were good beings who came to help the inhabitants of the earth in trouble
 baad main maine deshi-videshi parikthaon main bunon ke bare main tamaam kisse-kahaniyaan padhin
 Many are also in the fairy tales of the Grimm brothers
 bunon ko lekar likhi gai zyaadaatar parikthaayen badi dilachasp hai, par unamem ek bhi githmuthiye jaisi mjedaar nahin he
 Maybe, the mother also heard this story from her mother in childhood
 is lihaaj se parikthaon kii bhartiya parampara bhi ekadam nai to nahin he
 And if folklore is also added to it, then this tradition remains centuries old
 aisa nahin ki maan kii kahaniyon main yatharth na ho, par yatharth kii us abhivyakti main phantasy ghuli-mili rahati thi
 i remember, a surprising story of Mother was about 'hunger' and she associated it with Gandhari
 mahabharat yuddh main gandhari ke sau putr maare gaye the
 He was in bad condition due to mourning
 gandhari ke bahut rone-peetane ke baad, krishna ne use dilasa dete hue shok kaa parityag karne or kuch kha lene ke liye kaha
 But Gandhari did not listen
 aakhir krishna samajha-bujhaakar chale gaye
 The lone Gandhari remained on the battlefield
 aadhi raat ke samay gandhari ko jor se bhukh lagi
 While crying, he focused on a plum on the tree in front
 usne sochaa, "rone ke liye abhi raat padi he
 If i eat only a plum, then i get to know a little
 " sochakar usne ber ko pakadaney ke liye haath badhaayaa to ber unchaa ho gaya
 When the plum did not get caught in any way, Gandhari thought, "if i climb the dead body of a son, maybe the plum will come in hand
" "use shame bhi lagi, par ab tak bhukh bahut tej lag chuki thi
 Then he thought, "it's night time

 Standing on it, he wanted to catch the plum, but the plum had risen even further
 aise hi ek-ek kar gandhari ne ek ke upar ek apane sau beton ke shavon ko rakhaa or ber ko pakadaney kii koshish kii
 The plum did not catch, but Krishna was seen coming from the front
 paas aakar bole, "gandhari, yah kya?"gandhari sharminda hokar boli, "krishna, tum thik kehete the
 As long as we have to live, it is difficult to win with this hunger
 koi rog ho, shok ho, vah apni jagah he, par bhukh to is deh kaa dharm he
 She sees nothing but grief! "* This story i discovered a lot, but it is not in any new or old version of Mahabharata
 kisi puraana vagairah main bhi nahin
 
 
 
 par yah kahani maan ke lokved main thi, or lokved kii kahaniyaan aisi hoti hai ki padhakar aap bheetar tak hill jaaen!isi baat se yaad aayaa, lokmata yani satyaarthee ji kii patni apane niraale andaaj main kahati thim, "mauton bhukh buree, raati khaadi savere pher khadi
 
 
 ! "(hunger is worse than death
 raat use khaaya, subah vah phir saamne aakar khadi ho gai!)striyaan shaayad jivan ke rosemara ke is yatharth ko kahin adhik gaharaai se jaanati hai
 That is why Satyarthi ji used to interrupt and ask him, “do you sit down all the time talking about bread and money?” She used to say, “does a living last a day without eating? And if there is no money in the pocket for the fare So, will any bus conductor even let you sit in the bus? Then from where will your stroller, meet friends, stories of literature and gossip
 
 
 ?"maan paise se bahut zyada aakraant to na thim- or dhan ke maamle main laalchee ve haragij na thim, par itnaa to jarur jaanati thim ki paise or roti se bahut dur jaakar jindagi chal nahin sakati
 She was religious in nature
 unka dharmik hona unhen paise ke lobh se bachaata tha, par paise se virakti bhi vahaan na thi
 It can be said that a simple 'religious' was among them who 'donated' their wealth by donating money
 yani paisa sahi reeti se kamao or kamaane ke baad uskaa ek hissaa unhen jarur do, jo sachche dharmik guru, sadhu-sanyasi yaa phir jaruratmand log hai
 This was the truth of the mother's share of money, about which she had no dilemma in the end
 paise kii hai-hai yaa uske liye bawalaa hone kii yahan darkaar na thi
 Rather such greed or rashness was a bad thing here
 yaad padataa he, jagan bhai sahab jo ejeeniyar hai or shikohabad main hind lamps balb factory main dipti general manager the, unki shuruaati daur main hi ernakulam main kisi badi company main unche pad par niyukti ho gai thi
 Everything was set
 bas, us prastaav ko manjuur karne ke baad saamaan bandha janaa or prasthaan karnaa tha
 He had probably got the railway reservation done as well
 par maan baichaiyn thim
 He asked Jagan Bhaisahab, "what kind of problem do you have here, for which you feel it necessary to go so far away from home?" Bhaisahab did not have the answer to this question
 or vahaan tankhaa zyada milegi yaa falaan-dhikaan milegaa, yah maan ke nikat itnaa nirarthak tha ki unhen samajhaayaa hi nahin ja saktaa tha
 Here he had the same principle that earn, but also learn to keep satisfaction
 bahut paisa aa jayega, to kya ho jayega?aaj ke vakt main maan kii baat shaayad utani praasangik na rahi ho, yaa vaisaa na samajha jaae
 Her grandchildren and grandchildren are in distant lands today
 par maan ne hameshaa yahi chaha ki paas raho, ek-duusare ke saath sukh-dukh baanto or anaavashyak laalasaayen chhod do
 Live a contented life
 main kah nahin saktaa ki maan kii baaten aaj kii badali hui duniya main kitni sahi hai, kitni nahin
 But i would definitely say that mother was not even wrong
 aaj bahuterey logon kii puri jindagi ek andhi bhagdaud or hai-hai main bitati he
 What does it really achieve? The houses are desolate and the chat is ending there
 khaali-khaali ghar or unamem rah rahe do-ek ashakt jan
 There was silence in the whole house, because those who have life and liveliness, they traveled abroad
 bahut-bahut dhanyavad mobile, internet or web camere ko, jisane thodaa-bahut hi sahi, par ghar ke ahsaas ko bachaaya hua he
 Although sometimes i think, how much does a man need to live life? And then how much do we lose in return for what we go out to achieve - can there be any calculation of this? i remember, once the differences in the way of living and thinking of East and West While discussing, Swami Vivekananda drew the attention of Bhagini Nivedita towards a big difference
 unhone kaha tha, "sanataniyon kaa sara adarsh samarpan he, tumhaara (paashchaatya) adarsh sangharsh he
 As a result, we can enjoy life, you never can
 tum hameshaa apni dasha ko or achche main parivartit karne ke liye sachesht rahete ho, or uske karodawein ansh maatr kaa parivartan sampann hone se pehle hi mar jate ho
 
 
 
 "aaj jabaki pashchimi dhang kaa rahan-sahan hi ham par tari ho gaya he, tab maan ko or unke samay ko yaad karnaa kahin na kahin hindustaniyat kii jadon kii talash bhi lagata he mujhe
 And it makes sense to know how much we lost, and how much we lost
 *haan, yaad aayaa ki maan jinaki ungali pakadakar maine duniya dekhi, ve anpadh thim, par ve gita pard leti thim
 Geeta written in Gurmukhi script, whose language was not Punjabi, was Hindi
 shaayad naanaa ji ne praytn karke unhen gita padhanaa sikhaa diya tha
 The Gita, written in thick letters, was kept with a finger and read in a very high tone, "then Krishna said, o Arjuna, listen carefully to me
 " kuch-kuch usee tarah, jaise kachi yaa pehali jamaat ke bachche swar ko khinch-khinchakar apana paath padhate hai
 But this created a strange rhythm and charm in their speaking
 bachapan main maine maan ko akasar isi tarah subah-subah gita paath karte dekha
 Later either that copy of Gita was dilapidated or there must have been some other reason, due to which the Gita text of the mother was reduced
 lekin unka dharmik bhav to jaraa bhi kam nahin hua
 And she used to keep the fast so fast that for some week i saw her fasting for four-four, five-five days out of seven! Some were regular fasting and some special intermittent fasts
 unhen shaayad yahi sanskaar mila tha ki stri ko parivaar kii hit-kaamana ke liye khud ko galaa dena chahie
 The fast was not merely a fast, it was his penance
 or maan hi nahin, us peedi kii zyaadaatar striyon kii shaayad yahi jivan aasthaa thi
 She felt that for the benefit of her family, she could possibly home herself in this way
 or yahi ishwar ko bhi prasann rakhane kaa saadhan tha unke haath main, jisase duniya main santosh or sukh-shanti rahe
 * It is here that the date-festivals of childhood can be talked about in which the mother had the opportunity to see in new forms
 inamen ek ‘navann’ kaa parv tha, jisamen nae ann kii roti yaa shaayad paraantha banataa tha
 Churi was made by adding ghee to it
 ab maan aasapaas sab beton ko bitha leti thi
 With a grasping of the grapes in hand, one by one we used to ask the brothers, "chander, i will taste the ninth grain? 
 
 shyaam, main navaan ann chakhaan?
 
 
 Jagan, i will taste the ninth food? 
 
 satpal, main navaan ann chakhaan?"ham log ‘haan’ kehete, par kabhi-kabhi maan ko tang karne ke liye ‘na’ bhi bol dete the
 Then the mother would have to start the same process again, and thus the mother would eat every single piece of the powder and after the mother had eaten, we would have got the same thing again
 magar is parv kii khaasiyat yah thi ki maan bhi hamaare saath ekadam bacchee ban jaati thim or ham kitna bhi tang karen, unke chehre par jaraa bhi shikan nahin aati thi
 We used to laugh and mother used to laugh with us as a baby girl
 jaise yah bhi kho-kho jaisaa koi khel ho
 What must have been the spirit behind this festival? It seems that this is the festival of the agricultural system
 ghar main nayaa ann aayaa he
 It has been washed and dried and prepared to eat
 uski rotiyaan banakar saamne padi hai
 But there is a new grain, so do not know how it should be? It may also have slight toxicity or some other harmful thing, which has a bad effect on our health
 isliye vah nayaa ann ghar main aae or uski rotiyaan pakein to pehle bachche na khaaen
 The elders of the house should taste it first and see if it is safe or not
 or agar uske khaane par koi nuksaan nahin hota to phir ghar ke baaki log bhi khaaen
 Mother was the elder, the queen of the house and the kitchen, so she started her own life
 or khaane se pehle ve ham sabko satark bhi karti thim, "chander, main navaan ann chakhaan?
 
 
 Shyam, i want to eat ninth food? 
 
 jagan, main navaan ann chakhaan?
 
 
 Satpal, shall i taste the ninth grain? "so that if they suffer any loss, the members of the household are aware of it and they can be saved by timely treatment
 par yah to aaj sochataa hoon
 At that time, Navanan was a fun game for all of us brothers, and Mother used to play this game with us, it seemed really enticing
 isi tarah navaratri ke samay maan kaa utsaah dekhte hi banataa tha
 Mother 'khetri' (sowing barley in the house, symbolic farming) was a great passion
 uske liye shyaam bhaiya khaskar kheton se mitti laate the
 Mother had created a separate niche for sowing the field
 jau boe jate the or jis baras maan kii yah choti si kheti khub joro se lahalhati, maan kii khushi or umang kaa kya thikaana! subah katha hoti, aarti hoti
 Mother Goddess used to sing a lot of prayers and hymns to her
 par mujhe unamem ek hi pasand tha jisamen maan ke saath-saath doharaana mujhe acha lagata, "neen maiyaa, tera kongda ghar changa
 
 
 ! "in this Aarti, there was a line ahead which i liked very much," nangi-nangi Parin Raja Akbar v Aaya, Sona da Chhatar Chanta
 
 
 !" (nange pairon raja akbar bhi yahan aayaa or usne sone kaa chhatra chadhaaya
 My mother, your house is very good!) i repeat the rhyme of every line of this aarti with so much juice and so much fun, i must say, in a slightly mischievous manner that the mother's laughter would be missed by singing and singing- i would also laugh out loud
 yani bhakthi main bhi thodaa khilanddaapan aa jaataa or uski gambhirtha thodi kam ho jaati
 But the mother of my liberal thoughts had no objection in this
 isi tarah hoi yaa ahoi bhi maan kaa priy tyohaar tha
 i think it is called Ahoi Mata festival in Uttar Pradesh and Hoi in Punjab
 or yah santanon kii kalyaan kaamana kaa tyohaar he! baharhaal us din bhi gud kaa shira or doiyaan banatin
 We kids screamed loudly, "hoi
" 
 
 hoi
 
 
 Hoi, le apna dud-son, de meri doi
 
 
 !" phir maan ke pukaarane par ham daudkar jate or vahaan gud ke shire main dubi doiyaan khaane ke baad, lautakar phir chillaanaa shuru kar dete, "hoi
 
 
 Hoi 
 
 hoi, lai aapana duddh-puttar, de meri doi
 
 
 ! Who knew what milk was? Yes, the dough of jaggery flour filled the house - and also filled our hearts with joy and gaiety
 khel main leen ham bachche tab shaayad in chizon ko zyada nahin mahasoos kar pate the
 But with this game of children, the joy that was felt throughout the house, they were understood very well by women and could be felt on their happy faces
 or karvaa chouth kaa to najaara hi kuch or tha
 Early in the morning, with the very darkness, we children woke up to sleep
 uthakar dekhte to saath vaale kamare main badhiya-badhiya pakwaanon se saji thaliyaan liye bhabhiyaan
 Laughs a lot, talks and eats a little together
 unke bich maan, maano kisi rajmahishi ke-se gaurav se bhari hui najar aatin
 i would suddenly reach there and jokingly say, "okay, it's being eaten stealthily!" Mother including her sisters used to laugh very loudly
 or kahatee, "acha chal, tu bhi kha le
 
 
 ! ”if there was a story of Karvachauth Vrat in the evening, then the women of the neighborhood would come to our house with vigor and the story of mother would start
 us katha kii koi or baat to mujhe yaad nahin
 Just remember one line, which then attracted me a lot because of its bizarre phonetics that “jehadi rani hai, oh goli ho gaya te jehadi goli hai, oh rani ho gaya
 
 
 !" (yani jo rani thi, vah daasi ban gai or jo daasi thi, vah rani ban baithi!) in shabdon main pataa nahin dhvanyaatmakataa kaa kaisaa jaadu he ki aaj bhi inhen doharaate hi maano maan or ghere main baithi striyon kaa puraa ‘katha-sansar’ bheetar-baahar se mere aage khul padataa he
 There were other minor festivals
 inamen ek theth deshi kism kaa tyohaar basi khaane kaa bhi tha jise ‘bevade’ yaa aisa hi kuch kaha jaataa tha
 i think, it is also called 'basade' at some places and it comes only a few days after Holi
 or agar main galat nahin hoon to isi ko kahin-kahin sheetala mata ke vrath yaa tyohaar ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 On the night before the festival, a lot of potato parathas would be made and kept and the next day we would eat the same
 us din chulhaa sulgaane or garam khaane kii manaahi thi
 why indeed? That is, what was the real thing or belief behind it? i have not been able to know it till date
 haalaanki ek mitra ne pichley dinon bade aatmavishvaas ke saath samajhaayaa, ki "bhai, bevade parv main ek pratikarth he ki aaj tum basi khaanaa kha lo, par yah basi khaanaa khaane kaa aakhri din he
 After this, stale food stopped
 aage se ritu-parivartan ke kaaran taaja banaakar hi khaanaa chahie
 "can't say whether this interpretation is right or wrong
 magar itani baat tay he ki puraani bahut si chizon kaa pratikatmak matlab to he hi
 We also get the pleasure of comparing new and old times with them
 baat tyoharon kii chal rahi thi
 i remembered in the same sequence, Shivaratri was also celebrated very loudly in our family in the beginning
 shaam ke samay aangan main upalon kii aag sulgaai jaati
 We circled around, sprinkling water around him
 maan us aanch par mote-mote ‘rot’ sekatin
 Salty as well as sweet
 or ve kai dinon tak mithi or namakeen lassi ke saath khaae jate
 i remember eating salty rot with sweet lassi and sweet rot with salty lassi
 yaheen yah darj karnaa bhi shaayad apraasangik nahin ki maan shivbhakt thim or unhone hi meraa naam shivachand prakaash rakhaa tha
 However, such a long name did not work and at the time of admission in school, the Head Master Sahib himself shortened it to Chandraprakash
 par yah baat man main pulak bharti he ki is naam main maan kii chhuan he or mere naam main judaa chandra asal main shiv ke mastak main jadaa chandramaa he
 On the day of the festival, i do not know how to eat the things made by the mother and the unique juice comes
 yon maan koi asaadhaaran paak-kalashasthri na thim, par unki banaai chizon main bada ras hota tha
 Talking about the food cooked by the mother, the mother used to make potato and radish parathas very well
 makke or bajre kii khub ghi se tar roti to shaayad waisi koi bana hi saktaa
 We used to call it 'dhodha', not bread
 yani makke kaa dhodhaa, bajre kaa dhodhaa
 
 
 Etcetera
 sardi ke dinon main aisi chijen hamaare liye kisi anmol nemat se kam na thim or inke aage paanch tara hotel to chhodie, swarg ke pakwaan bhi ham chhod sakate the
 And in the winter, i still yearn for the molasses of molasses and flour made by my mother
 duniya kii acchhee se acchhee mithai se ve mujhe zyada swaad bhari lagati thim
 * Mother does not remember ever being beaten
 balki peetna to dur, yaad nahin padataa ki maan ne kabhi halake se bhi daanta ho
 Mother did not know what a strange belief it was about her children that my sons or daughters could not be wrong! Or they can never do anything wrong
 
 
 
 One small incident is missing - and it is about the occasion of Holi
 hua yah ki holi ko mushkil se ek-do din baaki the
 All of us children, with their own pitchers, were stuck on the strings
 hamaare ghar ke saamne khulaa maidan he, jiske chaaron siron se chaar galiyaan nikalati hai
 That is, anyone could come or go from anywhere
 or hamaari chaukanni nigahen in chaaron chhoron par thim
 So, a gentleman came out wearing a dry, dry coat and pants
 rob-rutabe or ghamand kii saakaar murti! ab un par koun rang daale? sabhi bachche dar rahe the to maine bidaa uthaaya
 i am the hero of that little boy! i secretly went after them and then suddenly splashed them with my atomizer
 pataa laga to ve kot-pantadhari mahashay gusse main fanfnate hue mere peeche daude
 i was small then
 dublaa-patala or ekadam chust
 So suddenly jumped up inside the house! Now i was in a safe circle
 ve sajjan bhi teji se ghar main aana chaahate the ki hamaare chabutare par dhadaam se gire
 
 
 
 chabutare par kaaphi geela rang bikharaa hua tha
 So, the color seemed more self-evident than what we applied
 ab to unka gussa or bhi buland
 He complained after coming inside
 maan ne kaha, "main daantuungi inhen, par ye to chote bachche hai
 Son, tell me, what did you understand that one day before Holi, you came wearing this suit? 
 
 tu to inase bhi gaya-beetaa he!"sunakar unka paara utraa, sharminda hue
 Later Mother explained to us that they do not do this
 par dusron ke aage apane bacchon ko kisi sherni kii tarah ve bachaati thim! or dhime se sikh bhi detii jaatin ki dekho, mujhe tumhaari vajah se kahin nicha na dekhnaa pade!alabatta maan kaa yah vishwaas jane-anjaane hamen bahut takat, bahut bal detaa tha or aaj bhi detaa he
 It used to be that the mother may have this trust in us, but we should not allow this belief to be false, not to let ourselves go astray

 When Parvez Rasool became the first cricketer from Jammu and Kashmir to be selected in the Indian team, there was a lot of politics after this, but this all-rounder believes that he should be judged only as a cricketer
 rasul ko zimbabwe daure ke liye bhartiya team main chunaa gaya tha lekin unhen ek bhi match khilne kaa mauka nahin mila jiske baad vivaad paidaa ho gaya tha
 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah strongly criticized the BCCI for not including Rasool in a single match of the five-match series
 lekin rasul puri tarah se gairraajnneetik bane rahanaa chaahate hai or unhone aagrah kiya ki unhen keval keval khilaadi ke taur par dekhen
 He said, 'A cricketer should always be seen as a cricketer
 maine purv main kaisaa pradarshan kiya or vartmaan main main kaisaa khel rahaa hum, meraa logon se aagrah he ki vah meraa akalan keval isi aadhaar par karen
 However, Rasool admitted that his selection in the national team has brought about a lot of positive changes in his state about cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘nishchit taur par mere chayan ke baad rajya ke kaaphi yuva khilaadi khel apana rahe hai
 Several new leagues have also been started, including the J&K Corporate Premier League

 ’unhone kaha, ‘jab aap antarrashtriya cricket khelte ho to aapako pataa chalata he ki baahar kii paristhitiyaan kaaphi bhinn he or yah kaaphi myne rakhata he
 Anyone at that level requires a lot of hard work
 ’ rasul kaa maananaa he ki vah aaf spinner hai jo ballebaaji bhi kar saktaa he
 He said, 'I am focusing on my bowling
 main apane doosraa par kaam kar rahaa hum
 i want to bowl good batsmen so that i can improve as a bowler
 ’unhone kaha ki bhartiya dressing room kaa hissaa banane se unka khel ke prati najariya puri tarah badal gaya
 Rasool, who considers Sachin Tendulkar and England's Graeme Swann, said, 'I learned a lot while traveling with the Indian team
 maine dekha ki bade khilaadi kaisaa vyavhaar or kadi mehnat karte hai or isse mujhe kadi mehnat karne kii prerana mili
 Rasool also said that he would play for Jammu and Kashmir in the Ranji Trophy
 unhone kaha, ‘jammu kashmir team ne mujhe sabhi maukey muhaiyaa karaaye

 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Lu Shibabao, who was in Chinese custody, died on Thursday
 pichley lambey vakt se liver cancer se jujh rahe 61 saal ke shyabao pichley 11 saal se china kii jail main band the
 International human rights organizations have sought permission to treat China Shibao abroad
 haalanki china ne in tamaam antarrashtriya dabaavon ko darkinar in agrahon ko yah kehete hue thukraa diya tha unhen gharelu doctoron se behtareen upachaar mil rahaa he
 In Shibaochen, he had been voicing support for democracy and due to this he was put in jail
 jail main cancer peedit shyaabaon kii sehat bigadane kii vajah se unhen pichley hi maheene vahaan se aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 At the same time, the hospital, which is treating Shybao, had said on Wednesday that many of his organs have stopped functioning and he is having trouble breathing
 doctoron ne bataaya tha ki shyabao ko jivit rakhane ke liye kritrim ventilation par rakhana hoga, lekin unke parivaar waalon ne manaa kar diya tha
 Shybao is the first Nobel Prize winner after German pacifist Karl von Ocietzki, who died in custody

 After the implementation of GST, there is going to be a big impact on the lottery system running in many states of the country
 jiesti council ne sarkaar ko apni lottery chalaane ke liye 12 fisadi kaa tex slab tay kiya he
 At the same time, the private lottery has a 28 percent slab
 is faisle se ek baar saaf he ki yadi kisi rajya ko apana rajasav badhanaa he to vah nijee companiyon ko lottery chalaane kii anumati de jisase vah zyada se zyada tex vasuul apane rajasav main ijapha kar saken
 Currently, there are some restrictions on lotteries and gambling in the country
 iske liye kendra sarkaar kaa lottery regulation act 1998 maujuud he jiske aadhaar par desh ke sabhi rajya aurakendra shashit pradesh lottery ke liye apanaakanoon bana sakate hai
 On the basis of this act, many states in the country conduct lotteries from time to time while some states also give approval to play online lottery
 gauratlab he ki desh main goa, punjab, sikkim or maharashtra sarkaar lottery ke khel yojit karaati he
 People above 18 years of age can participate in this game
 jahaan kai rajya abhi tak lottery ke is khel main kaarobaar par tex nahin lagaate hai or uski kamai inaam paane waalon se vasule ja rahe inakam tex ke jariye hoti he
 The central government estimates that the total lottery business in the country is around Rs 50,000 crore
 is khel ke jariye rajya sarkarein apane rajasav ko badhaane kii koshish karte hai
 Where previously no service tax was levied on private or government lotteries, now under GST, it will bring huge profits to the state governments
 kisi bhi rajya main lottery sanchaalak se 28 fisadi tex vasula jayega vahiin inaam paane vaale se inakam tex ke jariye kamai alag se hogi
 However, this decision of the central government has shocked the lottery business more
 lottery kaarobaariyon ko maananaa he ki jiesti main flats tex se unke kaarobaar ko nuksaan hoga or sirf sarkaar kii kamai badhegi
 Playwin, the country's largest online lottery company, believes the government should tax the company's profit margins instead of taxing the face value in the lottery game
 industry ke mutabik lottery ke khel main teen ham pahalu hai, pehla, sarkaar kaa tex, doosraa inaam kii raashi or teesraa company kaa profit
 Therefore, considering it a service, the tax on GST will only increase the government's earnings and businessmen will have to be satisfied with lower profits
 yon shoshan ke iljaamon se ghir kar asaram beshak jail main band hon, baahar aane ke liye haath-paanv maar rahe hon, lekin asaram or unke bhakt hai ki maanate hi nahin or is baar aasaraam ke ek chele ne di he dhamkee di he ki agar asaram ke khilaaf shikaayat karanevaali ladki ne apni report waapas nahin lee, to nateeja ek hi he, maut
 That is, Baba is now taking away the sum, the price, the punishment, the mystery at every trick
 telephone par ek shaks duusare shaks ko tathakthith sant asaram ke khilaaf darj kii gai yon shoshan kii shikaayat waapas lene kii dhamkee de rahaa he or naa sirf dhamkee de rahaa he, balki ye bhi kah rahaa he ki agar ladki ke gharavaalon ne aisa nahin kiya, to phir unke puure parivaar ko hi khatm kar diya jayega
 The person receiving the telephone is a friend of the victim's father's father, while the telephone person is the serviceman of Asaram, who has access to all the secret places from Asaram's ashrams, and at this time this same service girl named Shyam and his family members who He is saying something, he is not only shocking but very serious
 ladki ke pita ke dost ko shyaam ladki ke gharavaalon se asaram ke khilaaf darj karwaae gaye mukademe ko waapas lene kii baat kah rahaa he
 He says that if he did not do this, then the time to come will be very bad for him because if not today, tomorrow all these troubles will come to Asaram, but after this lakhs and crores of devotees of Asaram will not leave him, but with life
 Will kill vaise sidhe ladki ke pita ko phone kii bajaay unke ek dost phone karne ke peeche bhi shyaam ke paas apni daleel he
 He says that since the father of the girl is not picking up his phone these days, in such a way, he is the only means to deliver these things to her
 pehle pulisavaalon ko rishwat kii peshkash, phir jaan se maarane kii dhamkee or ab peedit ladki ke gharavaalon ke liye kahi gai asaram ke ek khasmkhas kii in baton ne salaakhon ke peeche qaid asaram ke liye nai musiibat khadi kar di he
 What else would it say that if Asaram was arrested for sexual exploitation and went to jail, his arrest is still impossible for the disciples of the same Asaram
 is telephonic baatcheet main asaram ke is khaasmkhas ko naa sirf ladki ke pita ke dost ko dhamkaate hue balki insaaf kii is ladaai ke hawa-hawaii sabit hone kii baat kehete hue bhi suna ja saktaa he
 At one place, this person says that from the media, all the people of the world will be left behind, only the girl and her family will be harmed
 haalanki asaram ke is shagird kii in baton par jab ladki ke pita kaa dost chutki letaa he, to shagird bhi kuch der ke liye sakapaka jaataa he lekin thodi der baad phir ye kah kar use dhamkaane kii koshish karata he ki asaram ko hazaron santon kaa samarthan he, jo asaram ke ek ishaare bhar se desh bhar main hangaamaa kar sakate hai
 However, after this fresh threat received over the telephone, now new trouble has arisen for Asaram
 jaahir he, jab asaram khud jail main hai to ye bada sawaal he ki aakhir kiske kehane par uske shagird is tarah peedit ladki ke gharavaalon ko dhamka rahe hai
 When Ram Jethmalani, India's finest and most famous lawyer, reached Jodhpur to advocate for his client Asaram, all eyes were on him
 asaram ke saath-saath aam log bhi ye jaanane ko betaab the ki akhir jethmalani wo koun si jaadu kii chadi ghumaate hai, jo asaram ke liye raahat lekar aati he lekin kehete hai naa ki kanoon apana kaam khud karata he
 Despite the arguments and arguments of Lijja Jethmalani, the way for Asaram to get out of jail was not cleared for the moment
 kam se kam somvaar kaa din to asaram ke liye koi bhi raahat le kar nahin aayaa
 On the one hand, while the High Court set aside the next date for debate on his bail on September 18, the lower court on the other hand ordered Asaram to be sent behind bars for 14 days
 ye or baat he ki jethmalani ne asaram ke haq main hai court main bahes karne main koi kasar baaki nahin chodi
 He justified the theory of Asaram's son Narayan Sai, calling him the mentally ill person who accused Asaram
 unka kahana tha ki ladki ne beemaari kii haalat main asaram par kaalpanik iljaam lagaae
 Jethmalani himself refused to accept the correct documents of Asaram's ashram, according to which the girl was declared a minor
 unhone kaha ki ashram ke dastavejon par yakeen karne kii bajaay ladki kii sahi umr kaa pataa lagane ke liye uski medical jaanch karwaai jaani chahie
 Jethmalani also raised questions about why the girl did not say this to anyone in the ashram when she was in a locked room with her mother
 unhone exiaar ke turant baad ladki ke 164 ke tahat bayaan darj kiye jane ko bhi saazish qaraar diya lekin is par abhiyojan paksh ne sawaal kiya ki ye sajeesh he yaa phir ladki biimaar he, jethmalani pehle yahi tay kar len
 However, after this heated debate, the court fixed Wednesday for the next hearing on bail
 prabhu ke putr ke paale hue pret ab apane asal rang main hai
 The girl who dared to naked Asaram's skyline of spirituality instead of being consumed in the face of filthy eyes
 aarope he ki asaram ke gunde jab kanoon se haar gaye to kanth ke jor par utar aae he
 Baba's disciples, who sell the blessings of life, are flirting to take away life, but this is nothing
 parivaar ko di ja rahi dhamkiyon main kaha ja rahaa he ki asaram ke shishy gandh main duube apane guru ko bachaane ke liye aatanki ban chuke hai
 Asaram may be inside but his leela continues outside
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ye asaram ke sevadaar shyaam kii awaz he
 Now there is silence in the ashrams of Asaram, but the devotion of the servants who are on his payroll is still speaking
 asaram kaa naach-gaanaa khel-tamaasha, uchhal-kud or dhol-tasha sab jodhpur jail ke lowep main band he lekin yahi bhakthi kii khaasiyat hoti he
 If the leeladhari is closed, then the leel of the lumps does not stop

 a few years ago, Bapu held a conference to throw light on the religions of the world
 jiskaa makasad sabhi dharmon main kaumi yakajahati ke bare main bataai gai baton kaa zikr karnaa tha
 The conference was inaugurated by the Mohatram Dalai Lama, in which scholars from Buddhism, Jainism, Sikh, Islam, Christianity and Hinduism consistently spoke on mutual dialogue and learning of harmony among all religions
