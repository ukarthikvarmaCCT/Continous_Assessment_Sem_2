 Uttar Pradesh is the most high profile among the five states where elections are to be held, which has been on the axis of the country's politics since independence
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main uttar pradesh kii janata ne akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party ko bahumat diya lekin rajya or khud party ke andruni halaat chunaav se pehle thik nahin hai
 The ongoing neura wrestling of nephew Akhilesh with uncle Shivpal has kept the party's waist bowed before the election
 khaas kar pichley ek hafte se party ke bheetar mache ghamaasan ne aane vaale chunaavon ke liye akhilesh kii raahen mushkil kar di hai
 During the last seven days, the SP state president Shivpal was shown the way out, the Chief Minister himself was also thrown out and Akhilesh showed rebellious attitude and showed strength
 tamam jod tod kii koshishen kii gayi lekin kuch bhi hon, party ke bheetar in saat dinon kii gatividhiyon ne sapa ko haashie par laa khadaa kiya he
 In December 2015, Chacha Shivpal started this arrogance by taking out three of Akhilesh's close friends outside the party
 lekin 2016 ke disambar maheene ke aate aate chachaa bhattije ke bich ye dwandv bahut vikaraal rup le chukaa tha
 The last few days of 2016 and the beginning of 2017 were a ruckus for the party
 dekhen pichley saat dinon ke dauraan samaajawaadee party ke andar kya kya hua?28 disambar 2016:mulaayam singh yadav ne 325 ummivaaron kii suchi jari kii
 It was full of Shivpal's favorites, while Akhilesh's close friends were sidelined
 mulaayam kii jari suchi main 176 maujuuda vidhayakon ko tikat diya gaya
 29 December 2016: Fueled by father Mulayam's ignoring of his favorites, Akhilesh released his list of 235 candidates late in the evening after a day-long meeting in which 171 and 64 new candidates were given place
 30 disambar 2016:mulaayam singh yadav ne bete soobe ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or apane bhai ramgopal yadav ko vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye apane ummidavaaron kii list jari karne ke dand swaroop party se chah saal ke liye nishkasit kar diya
 31 December 2016: After a day's rescue between Azam Khan, Mulayam Singh takes Akhilesh and Ram Gopal back to the party
 isse pehle isi din akhilesh ne apane vidhayakon kii meeting bulaai jisamen party ke 229 main se 200 vidhayak shaamil hue
 In a way, it was a demonstration of Akhilesh as Chief Minister
 01 janvari 2017:2016 kii antim shaam ko party main vaapasi ke baad akhilesh ne 2017 kii shuruyaat bade hi chaunkaane vaale andaaj main kiya
 In the afternoon, the national executive of the party declared Akhilesh as the new president of the party, then uncle Shivpal was removed from the post of state president and Amar Singh was expelled from the party
 haalanki iske jawaab main shaam tak mulaayam singh ne bhai ramgopal yadav ko ek baar phir party se chah saal ke liye nishkasit kar diya
 02 January 2017: Mulayam Singh reached the election commission and presented his claim on the Samajwadi Party's election symbol cycle
 03 janvari 2017:ramgopal ne chunaav ayog se apni mulaakaat main kaha, ‘akhilesh ke netritv vaali party hi asli samaajawaadee party he or 90 fisadi sadsy hamaare saath hai

 Nearly 200 teachers of Delhi University have written a letter and raised questions on PM Modi's statement, in response, another faction of teachers of Delhi University itself has come up with a letter in support of PM
 dilli vishvavidyal ke kareeb 200 shikshakon kii ye chitthee rahul gandhi ke guru or congress ke think tanks sam pitroda ne jari kii he
 The bottom line is that by criticizing a great man like Rajiv Gandhi, PM Modi has done wrong
 haalanki hastakshar abhiyaan chalaane vaale shikshak netaa khud maan rahe hai ki raajnneeti se pare kuch bhi nahin he, or wo khud congress samarthak hai
 When politics is being done through letters, in response, a letter has also come in support of BJP
 dilli uniwarsity ke hi shikshakon ke naam ke saath is chitthee main sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 The Congress is feeling that due to this letter, it will create an atmosphere against Modi, on the other hand BJP is justifying Modi's statement hundred percent

 It says that no prime minister has ever reached such a low level as Modi has reached through his actions
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki raashtra, purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii uplabdhiyon kii prashansa karata he
 In this, Rajiv Gandhi has been credited for mentioning the happiness of the soldiers and the communication revolution at the time of the use of Bofors cannons in the Kargil attack

 The Punjab Police has issued an alert for a terrorist attack in the state
 police kii ore se jari alert main kaha gaya he ki khalistaan gadar force ke aatanki punjab main diwali se pehle badi vaardaat karne kii firaaq main hai
 According to the report, ISI militants are also looking for an opportunity to carry out major incidents in Punjab during Diwali
 intelligence angesiyon ne police or prashasan ko shaharon or kasbon main bheedbhad vaale ilaakon par kadi najar rakhane ko kaha he
 Such a conspiracy was also revealed during the interrogation of the Khalistani terrorist caught by the Patiala police three days ago
 is shaks ne police ko bataaya tha ki videshon main baithe uske aakaa punjab main badi ghatana ko anjaam dene ke liye shadyantra rach rahe the
 Under this, he was to make a grenade attack around Diwali near the bus stand in Patiala
 police ke mutabik giraftaar shaks isaki taiyaari bhi kar chukaa tha lekin hamale ko anjaam dene se pehle hi wo police ke hathe chadh gaya
 According to an intelligence report, ISI has left its sleeper cells to perform Reiki in different cities and towns of Punjab
 ISI ke ye cell shaharon or gaanvon main kashmiri shawl or garm kapade bechney waalon kii aad main jagah-jagah reki kar rahe hai
 It is believed that two or three terrorist organizations have joined hands behind this conspiracy
 ISI ne is kaam main khalistaan gadar force or lashkar e taiyaba kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 After getting this intelligence, Punjab DGP has alerted IG, DIG, SSP and other police officers of all the districts

 Indian women have left men behind in terms of taking loans
 pichley teen saal main karj ke liye aavedan karne vaali mahilaon kii sankhya kaaphi teji se badi he
 This has been claimed in a report by Credit Information Company 'transunion Cibil'
 report ke anusaar, 'saal 2015 se 2018 ke bich karj lene ke liye safal mahila aavedakon kii sankhya main 48 fisadi kii badhat hui he
 In comparison, the number of successful male applicants has increased by 35 per cent
 haalanki kul customer base ke hisaab se abhi bhi karj lene vaale purushon kii sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 According to Indian Express, 86 lakh new accounts of women loan applicants are opened every year
 inamen se do-tihaai mahilaayein maharashtra or dakshin ke chaar rajyon tamilnadu, kerala, andhra pradesh or karnataka se hoti hai
 Harshala Chandorkar, COO of transunion CIBIL, told the newspaper, "we hope that in future there will be a further increase in loan applications by women
 isaki vajah yah he ki mahilaon main shiksha bad rahi he, tear van or tear 2 shaharon main kanjumar durables kii khapat bad rahi he or kaamkaaji mahilaon kii sankhya bhi bad rahi he
 'today one out of every four debtors is a woman
 yah anupaat or bhi badalegaa kyonki karj lene laayak mahilaon kii sankhya purushon ke mukaable zyada teji se bad rahi he
 The reason for better education and better share in labor market is now more and more women are taking their financial decisions themselves
 report ke anusaar kareeb 5
 Gold loans still account for more than the total loan account of 64 crores, although in 2018 it has fallen by 13%
 iske baad bijness lone kaa sthaan he
 However, the demand from women for consumer loans, personal loans and two wheeler loans is increasing from year to year
 jokhim kii baat karen to tamilnadu or kerala main sabase kam risk profile vaale rajya hai, jahaan mahilaon kaa ausat sybil score 781 he
 Older women are more inclined to repay loans, with increasing age as women have seen an increase in their CIBIL score
 sybil score badhane kaa matlab he ki mahilaayein karj chukaane main mustaid hai
 According to the data, women below 35 years have an average credit score of 773, while women between 35 and 45 years have the highest average score of 776 and women above 45 years have the highest score at 785
 sabhi mahilaon kaa ausat sybil score 770 se zyada he
 a CIBIL score over 750 is considered to be better and getting such a score easily gets a loan

 BSP president Mayawati has announced not to ally with the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 lekin is faisle ke sanket dirghakaalin hai
 This has shocked the efforts of Congress to enter the Lok Sabha elections with the Grand Alliance
 agar basapa is tarah kaa ravaiya upi main bhi akhriyaar karti he to soobe main congress alag-thalag pad jaaegi
 In such a situation, in the 2019 elections, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and UPA President Sonia Gandhi may have to chew iron gram to save their own seats
 bataa den ki bijepi ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko uske hi durg main gherne kii ranneeti bana rakhi he
 The BJP has been consistently active in both parliamentary seats to beat Rahul in Amethi and Sonia in Rae Bareli
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne donon kshetron kaa daura karke 'gandhi parivaar' ke kareebi netaaon ko apane saath milaayaa tha
 After the BJP, if the BSP faces the Congress in UP, it will be difficult for the Congress to save its fort
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne rahul gandhi ko amethi main gherne kii kavayad kii thi, jiske chalate congress adhyaksh ko apana kila bachaane main paseene chhot gaye the
 In 2014, BJP fielded Smriti Irani against Rahul in Amethi
 smriti irani ke khilaaf rahul ko jeetne main paseene chhot gaye the
 The situation became such that Priyanka Gandhi had to camp in Amethi
 iske alaava sapa ne apane ummidavaar nahin utaare the
 After this, Rahul could win by one lakh votes
 jabaki isse pehle ke chunaav main rahul ne teen lakh se zyada voton se jeet hasil kii thi
 Rahul Gandhi received 408651 votes in Amethi parliamentary seat in the 2014 election
 vahiin, bijepi kii smriti irani ko 300748 vot mili the
 While BSP candidate Dharmendra Pratap Singh received 57716 votes
 jabaki 2009 main basapa ummidavaar duusare number par the or unhen 93997 vot mili the
 Apart from this, the Congress account could not be opened in the 2017 assembly elections in Amethi
 jabaki bijepi ne sabhi paanchon siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Smriti Irani has been active in Amethi for the last four years
 wo lagaataar amethi kaa daura kar rahi hai or sthaneey muddon ko uthaakar congress alaakaman ko gherti rahati hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP fielded Ajay Aggarwal in front of Sonia Gandhi
 modi lahar ke baavjood wo sonia ke saamne kadi chunauti pesh nahin kar sake the
 But the BJP had received about two lakh votes
 haalanki sonia gandhi kareeb 3 lakh se zyada maton se jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thim
 But out of the five seats in Rae Bareli in the 2017 assembly elections, the Congress got just two seats
 iske alaava do siten bijepi or ek seat sapa ne jiti thi
 Now BJP has planned to siege Rae Bareli in 2019
 isi ranneeti ke tahat bijepi ne sonia gandhi ke sansadeey seat se emelsi dinesh pratap singh ko apane saath mila liya he
 In such a situation, if the BSP comes out in the elections then it will be a crooked task for Sonia to save her fort
 dilachasp baat ye he ki amethi or raiberli donon siton par dalit or obisi khaskar yadav samaaj ke voter achche khaase hai
 In UP, if SP and BSP join hands without Congress, then both seats will come to Mayawati's account
 basapa pichley chunaav kii tarah is baar bhi ummidavaar utregi
 In such a situation, along with the bsp's vote, the sp's vote will also get him, which will increase the difficulties for the Congress

 These trolleys are made in the Ramnagar market of Delhi and water filling is also done at Sadar Bazar, Ram Nagar Market and elsewhere
 hamane bhi ram nagar bazaar main ja kar aisi factory kaa jayja liya jahaan se traliyaan pani bharti hai
 Mrs
 Ratna, who has been running a water factory in Ramnagar market for many years, says that the MCD and the team of doctors inspect every water factory at intervals of few months and they are given licenses only when everything is found right
 aise main emsidi kii hi monitering kamity kii jaanch main pani kii gandi quality kaa paaya janaa apane aapmen kai sawaal uthaata he or ratna se jab hamane ye sawaal poocha to unhone mahaj sir hilaa kar yah sawaal taal diya
 Veena Vermani, chairperson of the monitoring committee set up for the investigation, says that these trolleys have been left with warning and a surprise inspection will be done after a few days
 agar us samay jaanch main bhi in troliyon main ganda pani mila to inkaa license radd kar diya jayega
 Vina Vermani clarified, 'we will not allow the capital of the people to play with the health, our objective was to provide clean water at a cheap price, but if someone works in this way for their profit then it will not be spared
 
 'aam aadmi ko garmi se kuch pal kii raahat dene ke iraade se shuru kii gai in thande pani kii traaliyon kaa istemaal dilli kaa har tabaka karata he
 These trolleys started with the promise of providing cheap and pure water, but now they are becoming a loss deal rather than cheap as dirty water is the main cause of many serious diseases

 If yes, then let us tell you that it was not a style, but it was a way for Amitabh to hide his injury, which was made 'his style' by his fans
 amitabh ne apane blog par likhaa he ‘kuli haadase ke kuch hi din baad main manmohan desai ke saath bangalore main kaam kar rahaa tha, tabhi ek din sidhiyon se gir padaa

 'he has written' When some time passed and the hands started recovering a bit, i asked permission from the doctors
 iske baad main haath main pattee baandhakar kaam karne pahunch gaya
 If you look at Inquilab carefully, you will know that i had tied a handkerchief on the entire film
 ’ amitabh ne likhaa he ‘uske baad maine jitna bhi kaam kiya, vah haath main rumal baandh kar kiya, jo ek style ban gaya
 'he has written' but it was taking too long to recover his hand
 meri twachaa kachi thi or usamen lagaataar dard tha
 My fingers and palm were healing, but still they were difficult to move
 ’amitabh ne likhaa he ‘uske baad meri ek or film thi, 'sharaabi'
 i was very upset for this, so i adopted another style
 apane is haath ko maine jeb main daal liya or puri film aise hi puri kii
 If you look carefully, you will know that my left hand is in the pocket throughout the film
 ’ Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of the Father of the Nation, said on Saturday that the man who conquered the British lions and the communal poisoned snakes in the country was more than a clever bania

 Gopalkrishna Gandhi, another grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, also said that Gandhi would laughed off being told to be a shrewd baniya, but this comment is badass and there is a hidden false intent behind it

 'ye he mohabbatein' kii lead actress divyanka treepathi se unke kariyar or nijee jindagi ke bare main hui khaas baatcheet ke pesh hai kuch mukhya ansh:'ye he mohabbatein' kii lead actress divyanka treepathi ne teen hafte pehle tivi actor vivek dahia ke saath vadodara main shaadi kii thi or vah in dinon apane kariyar ke saath asal jindagi main bhi teji se aage bad rahi hai
 Here are some excerpts from Divyanka's special conversation about her career and personal life: How is life after marriage? Three weeks have passed for marriage but every day is like a party
 ham rojaanaa kisi na kisi rishtedaar yaa dost ke yahaan ja rahe hai or hamaari khub khatirdaari bhi ho rahi he
 After marriage, life has become even more beautiful and i am glad that we took the right time to decide to get married
 padhein- 
 
 
 So the love story of Divyanka and Vivek started, i am lucky that i got such an honest, simple and big hearted soul mate
 vivek ek sachche jentalman hai or hamaare profeshan main yah hameshaa madadgaar hota he ki partner bhi actor ho
 We both understand each other's work commitments and do not impose anything on each other
 'ye hai mohabbatein' ke baad jis tarah aapke kariyar ne aakaar liya usase aap khush hai?hamaare kariyar main niyati kaa bahut bada role hota he or maine 'ye hai mohabbatein' ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 i worked hard for this role and before the show, i read the novel (manju Kapoor's Custody) on which it is based
 padhein- 'ye he mohabbatein' kii ishita kii shaadi kaa albumis kahani ne mujhe hilaa diya or meri ankhon se aansu nikal gaye
 The show is liked when you tell a good story
 maine abhi tak jo bhi kiya he usase khush hum lekin future main krime sho karnaa chaahuungi
 i have also done an episode of Adalat and this is a subject in which i have not done anything special yet
 tivi par aane vaale contate ko lekar kya raay he?ise lekar kai tarah kii raay hai, kai log milte hai jo kehete hai ki'buniya'jaise serial ab or nahin banate hai
 i do not think that creativity has been eclipsed
 hamaare paas achche sho mekars hai or achche kahani kehane vaale bhi hai

 samasya time management kii he
 All the big shows that have come in the past have been a hit because they had the best episodes
 aaj adhiktar sho kii rojaanaa shooting ho rahi he or rojaanaa episod banane hote hai
 In such a situation, quality is affected
 industry ko in baton par gaur karnaa chahie
 i think the solution may be to air the episode every other day or come four days a week
 is tarah logon ke paseepisod bankbanane kaa samay hoga or ve saans bhi le sakenge
 You are on social media, how important is it for today's artists? i am sharing the good moments of my life with my fans

 The government is with the victims
 dangon kii tulana nahin balki madad kaa akalan hona chahie

 Why did your government force bulldozers in Muzaffarnagar relief camps and cases were filed against those who did not vacate the relief camps? There were no bulldozers in Muzaffarnagar relief camps
 raahat camp main bhare pani ko sukhaane ke liye usamen sthaneey pradhan ne mitti khudva kar dalwaai to prachaar hua ki vahaan bulldozer chalaaya gaya he
 All the camps in Muzaffarnagar are over
 shamali main bhi jald camp khatm ho jaaenge
 No case has been filed against those who did not vacate the relief camp
 haa, yah shikaayat jarur mili he ki log peediton ko mukadmaa waapas lene ke liye dhamka rahe hai
 There are continuous reports that the riot relief camps are in bad shape
 thand se bachche mar rahe hai?kuch enjio or ek rajnatik dal ne apane news channelon, akhabaaron se kahalwanaa shuru kiya ki raahat camp kii haalat bahut kharaab he
 The children are dying
 hamane is dal ke logon se poocha ki aapke paas koi prastaav he jisase peedit ghar laut saken , to koi jawaab na aayaa
 People living in the camp do not want to go to government pucca houses
 to kya rajnatik dweshvash aapaki sarkaar ne upi main ek hindi or ek angreji ke news channel ko bain kar diya tha?hamaari sarkaar ne kisi bhi media ko bain nahin kiya
 Some people are doing politics on this
 jis vakt mujffarnagar or shamali ke raahat shiviron main bachche mar rahe the, usee dauraan saifai mahotsav main karodon ru
 Was it fair to celebrate SP leaders by spending? The Saifai Festival has been happening for the last several years
 sapa kaaryakarta or mela cameti, donon chanda jutakar yah kaarykram karaati hai
 The festival is important not only for artists of Mumbai but also for local students, artists, sportsmen, traders, farmers

 Did not cost more than isamen ek karod rupaya sarkaar ke bajet kaa he
 Was it necessary for government ministers, legislators to go on a "study tour" of six countries at this time, what would the public benefit? This is the initiative of the "commonwealth Parliament Association"
 iske liye centre sarkaar anumati detii he

 har varsh aisa pratinidhimandal daure par jaataa he
 Ministers and mlas have also invested money in this tour

 But overall law and order has improved

 Our government will have to continuously make some more efforts in this area
 congress or bijepi ke virodh main maahaul banaakar aam aadmi party sapa jaisi kshetreey partiyon kii rajnatik sambhaavnaaon par chot kar rahi he?aam aadmi party ke paas to sirf topi he
 SP has both common man's cap and bicycle
 sapa kii ek laal topi ‘‘aap’’ kii 100 safed topi ke baraabar he
 Living among the common man, cycling, this is the way of our party

 Our struggle is familism
 hamane hameshaa satta ke parivaarwaad kaa virodh kiya he
 These allegations are constantly being made that you are unable to work due to having many Chief Ministers in your government? If it is assumed that there are five Chief Ministers in my government, but the news channels are only abusing me
 ab in aaropon main koi dam nahin
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the SP has once again placed bets on musclemen like Atik Ahmed
 isaki kya vajah he?ginati kaa sawaal he
 Heads are counted in a democracy
 yah faisla bhi jeet main gina jayega
 Mulayam Singh has expressed his desire to become Prime Minister many times? If this is not done then how do you see Mulayam Singh's role in the state after Lok Sabha elections? Mulayam Singh is an inspiration to all of us
 unhone kabhi pradhanmantri banane kii ichha jaahir nahin kii
 The SP only wants the party to have more seats in the Lok Sabha
 aap kehete hai ki sapa sarkaar acha kaam kar rahi he lekin janata main aisi dharna kyon nahin ban pai he?jis jile main bada kaam ho rahaa he vahaan ke janpratinidhi ko hi isaki jaankaree nahin

 BJP MLA from Ramgarh in Alwar district, Gyan Dev Ahujane has given a disputed statement on the increasing cases of cow smuggling in the district and the attack, beating and killing of cow traffickers in the name of alleged cow protection
 vidhayak gyandev ahuja kaa kahana he, 'gotascari karoge, gokshi karoge, to yun hi pit-pit kar maroge
 In fact, cow smugglers carrying cow in Ramgarh area of alwar were fiercely beaten by alleged goraks in Yadav Nagar village, due to which Gotskar Zakir Khan was hospitalized due to ill health
 is bare main jab bijepi vidhayak se baat kii gai to unhone kaha ki mevaat ke alvar or bharatpur jile main haryana ke go taskar rajasthan ke marwar or mewar se lekar dur-dur se gaayon ko taskari kar laate hai or gaanv ke kachche raste se hokar jate hai
 Seeing the cows when they are stopped, they stone and shoot

 "input: IANS sanyukt raashtra kii kashmir report par aapatti uthaate hue riject karne vaale deshon main bharat ke saath-saath 6 anya desh shaamil hai
 During the General Debate of the Human Rights High Commissioner, when the report written by High Commissioner Jed Rad al-hussein was put up for debate, Africa, Eurasia and Latin American countries including Afghanistan and Bhutan from Asia decided to reject the report, questioning it
 Have done haalanki is report par bahes ke dauraan pakistan ke sanyukt raashtra main permanent ripregentative farrukh amil ne pakistan kii ore se apil kii ki jammu-kashmir main human ritis ke maamalon kii jaanch karne ke liye sanyukt raashtra kii samiti ko bheja jaae
 However, while speaking on behalf of Islamic countries, Pakistan's representative Amil only reiterated his point
 amil ne kaha ki sanyukt raashtra kii kashmir report ishaara karti he ki human ritis sanstha ko jammu-kashmir main aglaa upyukt kadam uthaane kii jarurat he
 No country appeared in support of Pakistan's stand on this report of UN
 vahiin report ko jahaan asian deshon main afghanistan or bhutan ne riject kiya vahiin latin america deshon main cuba or venezuela ne report ko riject karne kaa faisla liya he
 The Kashmir report has been rejected by Mauritius from Africa and Belarus from Eurasia
 inke alaava bhi kai deshon ne sanyukt raashtra kii is report ko pesh karne ke samay or tathyon par sawaal khadey kiye
 Significantly, this disputed 49-page report states that there are serious human rights violations on both sides of the Line of Control
 darasal yah maamla bharat ke liye isliye gambhir ho jaataa he kyonki maujuuda samay main pakistan bataur sadsy human ritis council main shariq he vahiin bharat 2018 se lekar 2020 tak council se baahar he
 Therefore, India's representative in the UN, Ashok Mukherjee, believes that India's position in influencing a resolution in the Human Rights Council is worse than Pakistan
 ise padhein: congress kaa aarope- bijepi ne kashmir ko barbaad kiya, jimmedaari se bhaag nahin saktigauratlab he ki bhutan ke yuan main ripregentative kinga singye ne tark diya ki human ritis hai kamishnar ne apni report main antakawaad ke mudde ko nahin chuaa he
 Therefore, stating the report as far from the ground reality, Bhutan has advised not to take any action on the basis of the report
 vahiin morishas ke ripregentative israhyananda dhalladu ne kaha bharat ke paksh main khadey hote hue daleel di ki kashmir par kisi teesri party kii madhyasthata kii jarurat nahin he
 Jed Raad al-hussein, the Human Rights High Commissioner who wrote this report, is a Jordan diplomat and was recently seen with Pakistani Hurriyat leader Syed Faiz Naqshbandi and some Pakistani leaders
 ek tasviir ke jariye is mulaakaat se andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki human ritis kii is vivaadit report ke taiyaar karne ke liye kahaan se tathyon ko liya gaya he
 At the same time, India has also argued that this report of the UN is also a violation of the authority given to the High Commissioner because according to the charter of the institution it is necessary to take care of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and jurisdiction of the member states in preparing any report

 The women of Bhumata Brigade, fighting for women's rights in the temples, were stopped by the police outside the Trimbakeshwar temple in Nashik
 police ne kuch mahilaon ko hiraasat main bhi liya he
 Brigade President Trupti Desai said that the Chief Minister of the state Devendra Fadnavis had assured him, but there has been something else
 mandir ke liye nikaleen in mahilaon ko sthaneey logon kaa bhi virodh jhelana padaa
 These women are protesting against the ban on entry of women devotees into the sanctum sanctorum of Trimbakeshwar temple
 is sanghathan ne 26 janvari ko ahmednagar zile ke shani shinganapur mandir main lagu aise hi pratibandh ko todane kii koshish kii thi
 On 26 January, this organization led by Trupti Desai made a rude attempt to break a similar ban implemented in Shani Shingnapur temple in Ahmednagar district
 tripti ne langik nyaay ke is abhiyaan ko jari rakhane kaa sankalp liya tha
 Choosing the occasion of Maha Shivaratri to carry out this campaign, this organization had asked the officials not to stop their march in this march like they had done last year
 yah pracheen mandir nasik se 30 kilometre dur sthit triambak shahar main he
 The temple has one of the 12 Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva
 deshbhar main jari aatanki alert ke kaaran or mahashivaratri ke tyohaar par lakhon shraddhaluon ke aagaman ke kaaran is mandir kii suraksha chaakchauband kar di gai he
 As part of its plan to advocate the entry of women into the 'sanctum sanctorum' of the temple, Bhumata Brigade President Trupti left Pune with about 150-175 workers
 unhone mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis se yah sunishchit karne kaa anurodh kiya tha ki pichley abhiyaan kii tarah is baar unki sadasyon ko raste main pakadaa na jaae
 Trupti said, "since the Chief Minister supported us on the issue of Shani Shingnapur, we hope that we will not be stopped and we will be allowed to enter the 'sanctum sanctorum'
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘hai alert jari hone kii vajah se nasik police ne hamase bason main na aane kaa anurodh kiya tha
 So we are going by small vehicles
 hamane apni sadasyon kii sankhya ko bhi kam kar diya he or ab sirf 150-175 sadsy hi hai, jo shantipurna dhang se garbhagrih main pravesh kii koshish karengi
 She also hopes that the police will take her to the sanctum sanctorum under complete 'settlement' so that the law and order situation does not deteriorate
 tripti ne kaha, ‘‘is shubh din par, hamen lagata he ki sthaneey prashasan hamen mandir ke garbhagrih main pravesh karne degaa or yadi hamen roka jaataa he to yah antarrashtriya mahila diwas kii purv sandhya par or mahashivaratri ke din mahilaon kaa apmaan hoga
 On January 26, the Nashik Rural Police has tightened security around the temple to prevent the situation that arose in the village of Soupa during the rise of women activists towards Shingnapur temple
 police up adheekshak praveen munde ne kaha, ‘‘hamane atirikt police bal tainaat kiya he or is shahar main kanoon-vyavastha kii sthiti ko banaae rakhane ke liye bhoomata bigrade ke kaaryakartaaon ko rokane ke liye avarohak bhi lagaae hai
 Meanwhile, the right-wing organizations Mahila Sukharata Samiti, Sharda Mahila Mandal, Purohit Sangathan etc
 have come together and decided to stop these activists before reaching the temple
 trayambakeshwar mandir nyaas ke sadsy kailash ghule ne kaha ki garbhagrih main mahilaon ke pravesh par pratibandh saalon puraani parampara he

 He said that men are also not allowed to go to the main shrine from 6 am to 7 am every day
 parampara ke mutabik, sirf purushon ko hi us kshetra main jane kii anumati he, jahaan mukhya ‘ling’ vidyaman he
 To get there, men also have to wear a special sowala (silk cloth)
 shahar main rahane vaale kuch pujaariyon kaa kahana he ki adhiktar mahila shraddhalu is parampara ko nahin todna chahengi
 Trying to give a scientific reason for this tradition, he said that some rays collect at the place of origin, which can be harmful to the health of women
 tripti ne shinganapur mandir ke aantarik chabutare par pravesh karne kii koshish karke deshbhar ke mandiron main langik pakshpaat par rashtravyapee bahes ched di thi
 Women are not traditionally allowed to worship in the Shingnapur temple
 tippaniyan Spiritual Guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar had suggested adopting the 'tirupati model' for philosophy while trying to mediate the matter, but Trupti refused to accept it
 is model ke tahat purushon or mahilaon donon ko hi shani bhagwaan ke praturup se dur rakhane kaa suzav diya gaya tha

 The politics is continuing on the statement of BJP President Rajnath Singh given on Tuesday to woo Muslims
 rajnath ne gujarat dangon kaa naam liye bagaiyr musalamaanon se kaha ki agar party se kabhi galati hui ho to vah sir jhukaakar maafee maangane ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin ab party pravaktaa prakaash jaavdekar kaa kahana he ki maafee agar bhavishya main koi galati hui to uske liye thi, iskaa 2002 ke dangon se koi lenaa−dena nahin tha
 The Shiv Sena has said that the party will never apologize to the Muslim community
 shivasena pravaktaa sanjay raut ne kaha he ki pehle jo kuch hua he use ham galat nahin maanate hamen us par garv he
 He also said that the BJP should clarify whether the party wants to apologize to Muslims on the issue of Ram Mandir Movement Uniform Civil Code
 vahiin bijepi netaa shahanvaj hossain ke mutabik, rajnath singh ne sirf yah kaha tha ki koi kami rahi hogi to maafee maang lenge, lekin hamase koi kami nahin rahi
 i was there
 unhone yahi kaha tha ki ham musalamaanon ke saath hai
 If there was any deficiency, she would bow and apologize
 hamase koi kami nahin rahi
 Congress leader Satyavrat Chaturvedi said that Mohan Bhagwat of RSS is ready to apologize? Is the Chief Minister Narendra Modi ready to apologize in the Gujarat where the minorities were massacred? If these two do not apologize, then Rajnath's apology has no meaning
 vahiin jane maane patrkaar or samaajawaadee party ke purv netaa shahid siddiki ne swaagat kiya he or kaha he ki gujarat dangon ko bhuulaa dene main harj hi kya he

 So far, the Supreme Court has given five shocks to the Narendra Modi-led BJP government in power
 supreme court dwaara die gaye paanch faislon ne modi sarkaar ke armaanon par pani pher diya, kyonki sarkaar in maamalon ko apni pratishtha se jodakar pairvi karne main lagi hui thi
 The collegium system Kayammodi had just completed her one-year term and was steeped in celebrations, during which the Supreme Court delivered the first setback
 centre main modi sarkaar ne satta sambhalate hi jajon kii niyukti karne vaali collegium vyavastha ko khatm karne ke liye 2014 main samvidhan sanshodhan kiya
 Instead, he wanted to appoint judges under the National Judicial Appointment Commission Act (NJAC Act)
 supreme court ne ek lambii bahes ke baad oktober, 2015 main sarkaar kii daleel kaarij karte hue engeesi act ko asanvaidhanik qaraar de diya
 With this decision, the collegium system of appointment of judges by the old judges has been implemented again

 After Manmohan Singh was nominated to lead the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) after the Lok Sabha elections in 2004, the then President APJ Abdul Kalam agreed to make Sonia Gandhi the Prime Minister's oath despite pressure from several leaders
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad raajnneetik sthiti par kalam ke is rukh se us samay ke ghatnakram par pardaa hat gaya, jiske bare main atakalein lagaayi gayi thim ki ve itli main janmin sonia gandhi ko desh kii pradhanmantri niyukt karne ke paksh main nahin the
 In his book titled 'turning Points', Kalam recounts his tenure as the President, recalling that if Sonia Gandhi had claimed for himself (for the post of Prime Minister), he would have appointed her, as he was the only one before her
 a constitutionally valid option existed
 purv raashtrapati ne kaha ki vah kareeb-kareeb nishchit the ki sonia gandhi samprag sarkaar kii aguwai karengi, lekin jab congress pramukh ne manmohan singh ko pradhanmantri namit kiya tab raashtrapati bhawan ko niyukti patr phir se taiyaar karnaa padaa
 Kalam said in the book, 'at that time there were many leaders who came to meet me with the request that i should not succumb to any pressure and appoint Mrs
 Sonia Gandhi as the Prime Minister
 yah ek aisa anurodh tha jo sanvaidhanik rup se maanya nahin hota
 If they had made a claim for themselves, i would have no choice but to appoint them
 ’unhone likhaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey ghoshit ho jane ke teen din tak koi bhi dal yaa gathbandhan sarkaar banane ke liye aage nahin aayaa
 He has written that he had to take many tough decisions during his tenure
 purv raashtrapati ne likhaa he, ‘kanoonee or sanvaidhanik visheshgyon kii raay jaanane ke baad bilkul hi nishpaksh tareeke se maine apana dimag lagaaya
 The primary goal of all these decisions was to preserve and promote the dignity of the Constitution and to strengthen it
 ’ varsh 2004 ke chunaav ko rochak ghatana qaraar dete hue unhone likhaa he, ‘yah mere liye chintaa kaa vishay tha or maine apane sachivon se poocha tathaa maine sabase bade dal ko sarkaar gathan ke liye aage aane or daawa karne ke liye patr likhaa
 The Congress was the largest party in this situation
 ’kalam ne likhaa he, ‘mujhe bataaya gaya ki sonia gandhi 18 may ko dohapar sava baarah baje mujhase mil rahi hai
 She came on time and instead of coming alone she went to Dr
 manmohan singh ke saath aayin evam mere saath unhone charchaa kii
 She said that she has enough strength but she has not brought the letter of support with the signature of the party officials
 ’purv raashtrapati ne kaha, ‘unhone (sonia gandhi ne) kaha ki vah 19 may ko samarthan patr lekar aayengi
 i asked him why you postponed
 ham aaj dopaher bhi ise (sarkaar gathan sambandhi aupchaarikta) puraa sakate hai
 She left
 baad main mujhe sandesh mila ki vah (agle din) shaam main sava aath baje mujhase milengi
 'while this dialogue was going on, Kalam received many emails and letters from various individuals, organizations and parties that he should not allow Sonia Gandhi to become the Prime Minister
 unniis may ko nirdhaarit samay shaam sava aath baje sonia gandhi singh ke saath raashtrapati bhawan aayin
 Kalam wrote, 'after the mutual greetings in the meeting, they showed me letters of support from various parties
 usapar maine kaha ki swaagatyogy he
 Rashtrapati Bhavan is ready for the swearing-in ceremony when you feel right
 uske baad unhone mujhase kaha ki vah dow
 Would like to nominate Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister who was the architect of economic reforms in 1991 and a trusted lieutenant of the Congress Party with impeccable image
 ’unhone likhaa, ‘nishchit rup se yah mere liye ek aashcharya tha or phir se raashtrapati bhawan sachivalay ko dow
 Manmohan Singh had to write a letter inviting him as Prime Minister and he was soon invited to form the government
 ’ purv raashtrapati kii is pustak ko harper collins india ne chhaapi he or agle saptaah yah relies hone vaali he
 After the swearing-in ceremony of Manmohan Singh and 67 ministers on 22 May, Kalam breathed a sigh of relief that this important task was finally completed
 skool ke dinon main sabase zyada tension or mjedaar kisson vaale dinon main se ek hote hai exam ke din
 When some of the class children were seen to be their savior
 saare student uske aas-paas aise chakkar lagaate hanjaise wo unako kisi badi musiibat se bachaa legaa
 Now who has spent time with books instead of playing video games and talking on the phone, it makes sense to be a hero in these days
 vaise skool ke dinon kii sabase mjedaar najaara exam haul kaa hota he
 When the temper of tension appears on the faces of many students, one simply comes to the time pass
 kisi ko duusare ke extra copy lene kii tension hoti he to kisi ko fail hone kaa dar
 Of course, you too must have seen many such scenes during your school days, then once again refresh all your memories

 Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde today raised a new controversy, accusing a section of the media of threatening to 'crush' the electronic media by misleading it against the Congress party and unnecessarily provoking it
 maharashtra ke sholapur jile se taalluk rakhane vaale scindia kaa yah bayaan kal shaam yahaan yuvak congress ke ek aayojan main saamne aayaa
 Shinde, a Lok Sabha member from Solapur, alleged that for the last four months a section of electronic media has been manipulating the news about him and his party
 unhone chetavanee di ki agar tatkaal is tarah kii khabaron ko nahin roka gaya, to electronic media ko 'kuchal' diya jayega
 Shinde said, “I am aware of what is happening in electronic media on a large scale
 pichley chaar maheene main media ne hamen (congress ko) bhadakaane kii koshish kii
 We will crush such elements in electronic media who indulge in propaganda and who do not stop doing so
 ' unhone kaha, 'mere adheen khufia vibhaag aata he
 i know who is doing these kinds of things

 There are some forces behind it

 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki aarthik susti, sarkaar kii udaseenta se bharatiyon ke bhavishya or aakankshaon par asar pad rahaa he
 Crisis on farmers due to the craze of low inflation, problems are also arising due to the import-export policy of the government

 He had said that the tenure of Manmohan Singh and Rajan was the 'worst phase' for public sector banks
 sitaraman ne mangalvaar ko colombia uniwarsity ke skool of international and public afares main ek vyaakhyaan main kaha ki sabhi saarvajanik bainkon ko 'nayaa jivan' dena aaj meraa pehla kartavya he
 The Finance Minister said, 'I respect Raghuram Rajan as a great scholar
 unhen us samay kendriya bank main liya gaya jab bhartiya arthvyavastha teji ke daur main thi
 On the former RBI Governor Rajan's comment on Modi government, Sitharaman said that there were a lot of problems related to bank loans during Rajan's time
 rajan ne haal hi main brown uniwarsity main ek vyaakhyaan main modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki pehle kaarykaal main narendra modi sarkaar ne arthvyavastha ke morche par acha pradarshan nahin kiya
 The reason for this was the excessive reliance on leadership for any decision
 saath hi netritv ke paas nirantar , taarkik drushtikon nahin tha ki kaise aarthik vruddhi hasil kii jaae
 The finance minister said, "it was Rajan's tenure as the governor of the Reserve Bank" when loans were lent through phone calls of conniving leaders
 is mushkil se baahar nikalne ke liye bank aaj tak sarkari puunji par nirbhar hai
 'he said,' Dr Singh was the Prime Minister and i am sure Dr Rajan would agree that Singh had a consistently clear view of 'india's economy'

 Team India's final in World Cup 2015 is scheduled to play! No Pandit or former cricketer has said this
 is baat kii bhavishyavaanee aankaden kar rahe hai
 This time when Team India landed on the World Cup playing ground, no one had expected that such a charismatic change would happen in the performance of Indian players
 bharat pehle australia se test siries haara, phir tri siries main bhi munh kii khaani padi
 But all this was happening, so from behind the curtain, preparations were also going on for Team India's World Cup
 world cap ke itihaas main team india ne ab tak teen baar final khelaa he, jisamen do baar khitaab jeetne main bhi kaamyaab rahi he
 For the first time in 1983, India won the World Cup under the captaincy of Kapil Dev
 iske baad bharat koworld cap final khilne ke liye kareeb 20 saal kaa intjarkarna padaa
 In 2003, under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly, India reached the final of World Cup but there India lost to Australia
 iske baad aath saal baad 2011 main phir bhartiya team world cap ke final main thi or is baar dhoni and company ne bharat ko world champion bana diya
 History is witness that when Team India reached the final of a World Cup, they had to face a tremendous defeat in the series just before that
 is baar bhi world cap se thik pehle maahi ke sher australia or england ke saamne buree tarah dher hue the
 If it is considered good luck, then this time also Team India can travel to the finals by repeating the feats of 1983, 2003 and 2011
 1983 world cap se pehle westeindies ne bharat ko dhoyaa, lekin team bani thi champion1983 vah saal tha jab kapil dev kii captaini main bharat ne pehali baar cricket kii duniya main ek mukaam banaaya
 But the interesting thing is that before this world, the Indian team had to face a crushing defeat in the West Indies at the hands of the West Indies
 bharat ne vahaan teen maichon kii siries 2-1 se ganvaayi thi
 Given the dangerous form of the West Indies team, no one thought that India would lift the World Cup trophy
 lekin world cap se pehle mili vah haar shaayad team india ke liye vardaan sabit hui or bharat pehali baar world cricket kaa badshaah ban gaya
 After the defeat in New Zealand before the 2003 World Cup, there was a lot of disappointment in 2003, India was seen as a favorite of the World Cup, adorned with star players like Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Javagal Srinath and Anil Kumble
 
 lekin world cap se thik pehle jo hashr team india kaa newjiland main hua, usase ummid kaa diya bujhataa hua dikhaa
 India lost the 7-match ODI series 5–2 there
 lekin world cap main newjiland ke pradarshan ko peeche chhodte hue team india ne final tak kaa safar tay kiya
 However, India lost to Australia in the final
 yahaan bhi world cap se pehle mili haar team india ke liye good lack hi lekar ai
 They lost to South Africa before the 2011 World Cup, but the remade World Champion 2011 World Cup was very special, as it was the last World Cup of legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar
 bharat is toornament kaa ko-host tha, isliye ummiden bhi bahut thim ki is baar to bharat cap jitegaa hi
 Team India reached South Africa just before the World Cup in view of preparations, but there the hosts defeated India 3–2 in the 5 match ODI series
 ek baar phir world cap se pehle mili haar bharat ke paksh main rahi or bharat dobaaraa world champion ban gaya

 Not only the entire country, the entire cricket world has been waiting for Sachin Tendulkar's century for the last eight months and if it happens in the second Test match against West Indies, it will be the most memorable moment for the historic Eden Gardens
 kolkatavasiyon ko puraa vishwaas he ki tendulkar unke shahar main hi shatakon kaa shatak puraa karenge

 ' Bollywood superstar Salman Khan has been convicted in the famous black deer hunting case
 salmaan ke alaava anya sabhi aropiyon ko bari kar diya gaya he
 This decision was pronounced by CJM Rural Devkumar Khatri in Jodhpur Court of Rajasthan
 lekin court main bahes ke dauraan kya hua or aisa kya hua jo salmaan ke vipaksh main gaya
 Read here 
 
 kyon doshi qaraar die gaye salmaan khan?varisht vakil ashok joshi ne ajtak se baat karte hue kaha ki salmaan khan ko court ne doshi qaraar diya he
 In this case, Salman can be punished up to 6 years
 unhone bataaya ki agar salmaan ko 3 saal se kam kii sazaa hoti he to unhen isi court se bel mil sakati he
 During the time when Salman Khan was convicted, Ashok Joshi was present in the court room
 LIVE: kaala hiran cese- salmaan khan doshi, saf-tabboo samet baaki sabhi aaropee bararshok joshi ne kaha ki isse pehle chinkaara ke do maamle main bari ho gaye the, wo sab jan sakshya ke aadhaar par kiya gaya tha
 But there is strong evidence against him in this case because 3 eyewitnesses were present
 or chashmadid ne court main saaf taur par kaha he ki usne salmaan khan ko shikaar karte hue dekha
 According to the lawyer, all the evidence went against Salman and hence he was convicted
 vakil ne bataaya ki jinhen bari kiya gaya he, bel bond dena hoga
 If the state government appeals against them, they will have to appear again
 sazaa par bahes ke dauraan kisne kya kaha?paksh -court main salmaan khan ke vakil hastimal ne kaha ki unhen kam se kam sajaa ho
 Because Salman is a good person, he serves the society
 vipaksh -duusari taraf sarkari vakil bhavani singh ne salmaan khan ko 6 saal kii sazaa dene kii maang kii he
 The government lawyer said that Salman Khan is a habitual criminal
 kai aise maamle rahe hai, salmaan is tarah ke aparaadh karte rahe hai
 He also argued that if the big star gets punished then no one will commit such a crime
 shooting ke dauraan shikaar kaa aaropabatate chalem ki 1998 main jodhpur main apni film 'ham saath-saath hai' kii shooting ke dauraan salmaan khan par kaale hiran kaa shikaar karne ke aarope lage the
 He was also arrested in this case
 salmaan khan ko paanch dinon tak jail main rahanaa padaa tha
 On September 22, 1998, police had recovered a revolver and rifle from his room
 somvaar ko gurdaspur main hue jis aatanki hamale ne saat begunaahon kii jaan le lee or jis hamale ne puure din tamaam mulk kii saanse rukvaa di, us hamale kii saazish bhi seemaa paar yani pakistan main hi rachi gai
 At the end of the operation, everyone from the DGP of the state to the country's home minister made it clear that Pakistan is behind this attack
 ek-ek kar teenon aatankiyon ke dher karne ke baad police or swat ke javaanon ne dobaaraa gurdaspur ke dinanagar thane par kabza kiya, to laashon ke aas-paas bikhare subut pakistan kii karatuut kii tasdik kar rahe the
 If sources are to be believed, the police should hand over Global Positioning Setsayani GPS from these terrorists, who are usually used by terrorists who infiltrate from Pakistan to understand their location
 ab ek taraf jahaan suraksha agenciyon unke paas se baraamad jeepies kii data analysis main juty hai, vahiin ab tak tafteesh main unke pakistan se sarhad paar kar hindustan main daakhil hone kaa takreeban puraa root hi saaf ho chukaa he
 According to the Ravanasutras who were from the village of Pakistan, these three terrorists left for Hindustan from the camp of lashkar-e-tayyiba, present in Gharot village near Shakargarh town of Pakistan, on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday
 iske baad chaukasee kii kami or karaab mausam kaa faaydaa uthaate hue teenon raavi nadi paar kar hindustan ke bamial gaanv pahunche or phir vahaan se aage bad gaye
 From there, all three reached the 1-A highway in a bus in the morning and after crossing several checkposts from Jammu and Kashmir to Punjab, came to Gurdaspur
 lekin ye hairaani kii baat he ki na to raat ko kisi surakshakarmiyon kii nazar inpar padi or naa hi kisi checkpost par inase koi poochtacha hi hui
 This time too Pakistan has denied having its hand in this attack, but there are evidence related to this, which neither Pakistan can deny nor anyone else
 in aatankiyon ne jis tarah faujee libaas main gurdaspur par hamalaa kiya, vaisaa hamalaa isse pehle bhi lashkar e taiyyaba or jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankwaadi karte rahe hai
 This attack is similar to the suicide attacks in Kathua and Hira Nagar in Jammu last year
 pakistan se aae aatankwaadi ab kisi ek thikaane ko target nahin karte, balki dehshat zyaada se zyaada failaane ke liye wo ek saath kai jagahon par target karte hai
 First laying a bomb on the railway track, then shooting the car owner, then firing on the bus and then taking over the station
 aatankiyon ke paas baraamad do jeepies set, eke 47 raifal, 18 megsine or china main bane hathgole apane-aap main gahari saazish kaa subut he
 It is also an open truth that Pakistan has been taking its share from China
 aise main is hamale ke peeche naa sirf pakistan kaa haath saafe hota he, balki inhen non state actor bataane kii chaal bhi benakaab hoti he
 Like 26-11, this time too, these terrorists had taken dry fruit with them to serve for a long time
 pehle mil chuki thi hamale kii bhanakakhufia agenciyon kii intcept bataati he ki is hamale kii bhanak unhen pehle hi mil chuki thi
 If sources are to be believed, the intelligence agencies had already issued a warning for an attack on military bases in Himachal, Jammu and Pathankot
 balki ek input main to pakistan ke gharot ilaake se hindustan ke rihaayshi ilaakon main aatankiyon ke daakhil hone kaa andeshaa saaf-saaf jataayaa gaya tha ye hamalaa thik vaisaa hi tha
 Just three-four minutes later a passenger train was to pass close to Dinanagar
 subah ke vakt sabase zyada bheed usee paisanger train main hoti he
 But then a person going to get milk caught sight of a bomb lying on the track
 satpal naam ke ek kisaan kii jaagrukta ne yahaan hone vaala bhayanak haadasa taal diya
 Darshan Kumar told that as soon as he got the news of a bomb on the railway track
 unke pairon tale zamin khisak gai
 Because the passenger train number 54612 was supposed to reach there within barely 4-5 minutes
 isamen aamtaur par sabase zyada bheed hoti he
 After the terrorist attack on 27 July, there is still a strange fear in Gurdaspur, while the air of martyrdom and Jambazi has also dissolved in the air
 sabase pehle aatankiyon ne maasoom musafiron ko shikaar banane kii koshish kii thi
 In the morning, the Punjab Roadways bus was going towards Katra in Jammu
 is bas main kareeb 76 yatri bas baithe the
 Suddenly a bus driver was seen standing on the roadside
 uske kapade or harakat dekh kar driver ko shaq hua
 And his wisdom saved the lives of all these travelers
 dinanagar par hua hamalaa kai pariwaron ke liye dard or gam bhi lekar aayaa
 The family of SP Baljit Singh, who was martyred in the terrorist attack, is also one of them
 unki shahadat par puure desh ke saath-saath parivaar ko bhi garv he
 But how to hide the sorrow of losing your loved ones
 shahid espi balajit singh ke gharavaalon kaa sabar tut gaya or aansu chhalak pade
 The terrorists were firing from the wall of the police station and SP Baljit Singh was posted on the front with the soldiers
 captain hone ke naate balajit singh apana ferj nibhaa rahe the or farz kii raah me qurbaan ho gaye
 The sacrifice of sacrifice for duty was inherited by SP Baljeet

 One of the attractive examples of Rajasthan's art is Chand Baoli

 The comments on Facebook have started getting a sharp response
 kai nami giraami logon ne is maamle main shaamil police waalon ko barkhaast karne se lekar giraftaar karne tak kii maang kar daali he
 Arvind Kejriwal of India Against Corruption also reacted sharply to the case and tweeted that any policeman who arrested the girls should be immediately suspended
 unhone sarkaar se kam se kam yah kadam turant uthaane ko kaha
 Shobhaa Dey tweeted, 'the policemen who threatened Shaheen and Rini after commenting on Facebook dropped the credibility of the police
 pehle un gundon ko giraftaar kiya jaae or ladakiyon se liye gaye 15 hajaar rupee unhen waapas kiya jaae
 Abha Singh, wife of social worker and YP Singh, will file a complaint in Maharashtra State Women's Commission against the policemen who accused the girls of commenting on shutting down Mumbai after Thackeray's death
 udhar ladakiyon ne jail se reeha hone ke baad fasebuk par ‘sori’ post kiya
 Actually the case is of two girls who reacted to Facebook on the Mumbai bandh after Bala Saheb's death
 inamen se ek ladki ne coment post kiya tha jabaki duusari ne us coment ko like kiya tha
 After the girls' reaction, Shiv Sena showed their orgy and vandalized their uncle's hospital
 police ne iske baad un donon ladakiyon ko giraftaar kiya tha jinhen 15 hajaar rupee ke niji muchalke par chhod diya gaya tha
 After getting out of jail, these girls commented on Facebook twice and this time they wrote 'sorry'

 When the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), 2019 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 9 December, thousands of people from every section took to the streets in many places in Assam
 logon kaa maananaa he ki yah unki jameen, bhashaa or pahchaan ko nasht karne kaa shadyantr he
 So, a period of spontaneous protests started
 do din baad jab vidheyak sansad ke donon sadanon se paas ho gaya or usne kanoon kii shakl le lee to assam or purvottar ke kai hisse dhu-dhookar jal uthe
 Curfew was imposed, army was called and internet services were stopped
 is bich is nae sanshodhan par desh bhar main nai bahes chhid gai he kyonki is vivaadaaspad kanoon se sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon ke ulanghan or desh kii dharmanirpeksh patibadghta par kai sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 The main objective of the CAB is to provide citizenship of India to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian minority refugees originally from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan
 uparokt mandandon par yogya or 31 disambar, 2014 ko yaa usase pehle bharat main pravesh karne vaale sharnaarthi bharat kii naagarikta ke liye aavedan kar sakate hai
 Also, any legal action pending against such 'illegal immigrants' will be 'over'
 aantarik bantwaaraa?bharat main aise sharnaarthiyon ko sharan dene kaa lanbaa itihaas he, jinhone kahin or atyaachaar jhele hai, lekin siabi kaa joardaar virodh ho rahaa he kyonki musalamaanon ko iske daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, the leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party in the Lok Sabha, said, "the bill is not only divisive, but it also betrays the basic spirit of our Constitution
" yah aresas or bhaajapa ke sapanom kaa 'hindu raashtra' banane kii disha main kadam he
 "BJP is taking this forward by saying that it is the moral responsibility of India to give shelter to non-muslim minorities of three Muslim-majority countries
" ajeeb yah bhi he ki vidheyak main yah zikr nahin he ki yah sirf dharmik aadhaar par pratadit sharnaarthiyon ke liye he
 This contradicts the argument that Muslims do not need protection under the Bill because those Muslim-majority countries are unlikely to face their religious persecution
 sadan main bhaajapa kii aguai vaali endie sarkaar ne apane sankhya-bal se in sabhi andeshon kii andekhi karte hue berahami se ise aage badhaayaa
 Union Home Minister Amit Shah said in the Lok Sabha to justify his argument like 'we must protect the Hindus', that in 1947, the Congress split by accepting partition on religious grounds
 ve apni vinaashkari soch ko jaij tehraane ke liye tarah-tarah ke aankade pesh karte rahe ki 1951 main bharat main hinduon kii aabaadi 84 pratishat se ghatakar aaj 79 pratishat ho gai he jabaki muslim aabaadi 1951 ke 9
 14 percent today, up 8 percent
 23 pratishat ho gai he
 They forgot what its starting point was
 sharnaarthi bandobast par kaam karne vaale samaaj vigyaani or visheshgy in tarkon se sahamat nahin or ve is vidheyak kii ninda bhi kar chuke hai
 Surya Dev, Associate Professor at the School of Law of the City University of Hong Kong and an advisor to the United Nations Human Rights Council, says, "the CAB not only violates the provisions of equality stated in the Indian Constitution, but also as a basic structure of the Constitution The proposal also violates the idea of secularism
 ''shah ne 'avaidh ghuspaithiyon' or 'sharnaarthiyon' ke bich antar karke bhi siabi ko sahi tehraane kii koshish kii
 Accordingly, victims of religious persecution — people from the above six religions — would be considered refugees, while others who entered India illegally would be considered intruders
 yah aisa tark he jise sunakar bahut-se log chakra gaye hai
 The need for a specific bill on refugees from these three countries is also being questioned
 maujuuda niyamon ke anusaar, padosi deshon (myanmar ko chhodkar) ke sharnaarthi sarkaar se sidhe suraksha kii maang kar sakate hai or unhen videshi kshetreey panjikaran adhikari (epararo) dastavej jari karte hai
 Refugees from non-neighboring countries and Myanmar fall under UNHCR (united Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) provisions that assess each individual claim
 sarkaar vartmaan main myanmar ke rohingya musalamaanon sahit sabhi sharnaarthiyon ko yuanechasiaar aaidi ke saath 'dirghakaalik vija' ke liye aavedan karne kii anumati detii he, or har maamle kii alag se chaanbin ke baad vija jari karti he
 India is one of the few countries in the world that has neither a national refugee security framework nor an immigration policy
 kuch kanoon hai jinke daayre main sharnaarthi aate hai jinamein videshi panjikaran adhinium, 1939; videshi adhinium, 1946 or passport adhinium, 1967 shaamil hai
 India is also not a signatory to any such treaty of the United Nations, so it is not bound to confer the rights set out from them
 darasal, yah sharnaarthiyon ko tadarth aadhaar par dirghakaalik vija dene kaa nirnay letaa he
 According to the latest UNHCR estimates (2017), India has 2,00,000 refugees, making it the 25th largest host country
 bharat main vividh deshon ke nivaasiyon kaa mishran dekha ja saktaa he—1959 main aae tibeti; 1971 main bangladesh se aae log; 1963 or phir 1970 ke dashak main aae chakma sharnaarthi; 1983 or 1989 tathaa phir 1995 main srilanka se aae tamil; or phir '80 ke dashak main aae afgaan sharnaarthi
 Leaders of South India are particularly critical of the CAB for not including refugees from Sri Lanka
 dramuk ke dayaanidhi maaran ne kaha, ''aap bangladesh or pakistan ko lekar zyada baichaiyn dikhte hai, lekin aap abhi tak yah nahin samaj paae hai ki aap sirf bharat ke uttari hisse ke grih mantri nahin hai
 “rohingya Muslims of Myanmar are also a big issue
 centre ne unhen koi raahat dene se inkaar kar diya he or kai bhaajapa netaaon ne khule taur par yah kaha he ki rohingya rashtriya suraksha ke liye khatra hai
 He says that even Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia are not allowing him to enter them
 is sab main sarkaar kaa mul tark he—aise kai desh hai jahaan musalmaan ja sakate hai, lekin bharat hinduon ke liye ekmaatr desh he
 The bjp's former ally Shiv Sena also supports this view, but says that "if vote bank politics is the goal under the cover of the CAB, then it is not in the interest of the country
" '' sanvaidhanik visheshgy subhash kashyap bhi shivasena kii ashanka kaa samarthan karte hai
 He says that it is vote-bank politics that is supporting or opposing the bill
 ve kehete hai, ''donon pakshon kaa dhyaan bas is baat par he ki unka rajnatik hit kahaan sadhta he, isaki kanoonee chintaa kisi ko nahin he
 "it means that all those things are present in the Bill, on the basis of which it can be legally challenged in the Supreme Court
" kashyap kehete hai ki iske paksh main or khilaaf, donon tarah ke tark hai
 He explains, "article 14 emphasizes equality before the law but there have been several Supreme Court decisions which say that this right to equality can be accompanied by proper classification
" vastav main, sabhi moulik adhikaar uchit vargeekaran ke adheen hai
 Anyone can challenge this bill in the apex court
 iskaa bhavishya mote taur par is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki adaalat is vidheyak ke bheetar kiye gaye vargeekaran ko uchit maanati he yaa nahin
 "the BJP has both ideological and electoral reasons to move the Bengal CAB forward
" aresas or bhaajapa ne lambey samay se saarvajanik rup se hindu pravaasiyon ko naagarikta dene ke prati apni patibaddhta jataai he
 It was also part of his 2014 and 2019 election speeches
 haalanki, alpakaalik uddeshy pashchim bengal main hindu 'sharnaarthi matadaataaon' ko lubhaana lagata he, jo rajya ke 294 vidhansabha kshetron main se 70 main paryaapt sankhya main hai or assam kii baraak ghati or brahmaputra ghati main kai nirvachan kshetron main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaate hai
 After a spectacular performance in West Bengal in May, Lok Sabha elections in May, winning 18 out of 42 seats, the BJP lost in the by-elections in three recent assembly segments
 is haar ke liye vishesh rup se bangladeshi apravasiyon ke bich, desh bhar main nagarikon ke liye rashtriya register (enarasi) taiyaar karne se judi ashankaon ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya he
 Although the NRC aims to detect illegal intruders, the NRC prepared in the Supreme Assam under the supervision of the Supreme Court, in which around 5,00,000 of those excluded from the list are suspected to be Hindu Bengalis and from this the community of West Bengal Panic has spread in bhaajapa assam main enarasi ko pehle hi khaarij kar chuki he
 In fact, the CAB is now seen as a means of eradicating similar fears among Hindu migrants of the state and keeping them with them as these migrants were the basis of the party's success in 2019
 padosi rajya bengal main, rajya bhaajapa ne jila ikaayiyon ko ghar-ghar jaakar logon ke man se siabi kii ashankaayen dur karne kaa abhiyaan chalaane ko kaha he
 Party mps from the state have also been engaged in this work
 assam ke congress saansad gaurav gogoi kaa daawa he ki siabi rajya main enarasi kii vifaltaa se dhyaan hataane kii kavayad ke alaava kuch bhi nahin he, kyonki enarasi se bahishkrut 19 lakh logon main se bahut-se vaastavik bhartiya hai
 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, who also tore a copy of the bill in Parliament, is one of its staunch critics
 unka maananaa he ki iskaa uddeshy sirf musalamaanon ko naagarikta se vanchit rakhana he
 Says Owaisi, "look at CAB with NRC specs
" assam main enarasi se bache 19 lakh main se 5,40,000 bengali hindu hai
 After the passage of the CAB, action against them will be stopped; It will be continued only against the remaining Muslims
 ''siabi nishchit rup se pashchim bengal ke hindu sharnaarthiyon kii lambey samay se chali aa rahi ek maang ko puraa karata he jinamein se zyaadaatar matua samudaay ke hai or jo 1971 ke baad bangladesh se bharat main daakhil hue the
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Matua people helped the saffron brigade win 9–10 seats safely, and could benefit from around 70 assembly constituencies
 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaav main trinmul congress pramukh mamata banerjee ne 34 saal baad rajya kii vam morcha sarkaar ko satta se baahar kiya to ve unke peeche majbootee se khadey the
 But after that the Matua community also trended towards BJP
 aashcharya nahin ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apana loksabhaa chunaav abhiyaan pashchim bengal main kolkata se 70 kimi uttar main matua samudaay ke garh thakurnagar se shuru kiya
 The CAB will also help BJP consolidate migrant votes as they will not be considered foreigners in the proposed NRC
 assam ke vitt mantri hemanth biswa sarama ne kolkata main india today east conklev main bhaajapa kii is ranneeti ko chhipaane kaa prayaas nahin kiya
 "you can consider NRC and CAB as a combo package for West Bengal and Assam," he said
 ''tiemasi bhi apni ranneeti taiyaar kar rahi he
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has already announced that the NRC or CAB will not be allowed to be implemented in the state
 tiemasi netaaon kaa maananaa he ki unke is ravaiye se party ko un 120 siton par madad milegi jahaan alpsankhyak or sharnaarthi aabaadi paryaapt he
 TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee said in Lok Sabha, "NRC is a lollipop and CAB is a bigger temptation than that
" yah vidheyak bharat virdohi or bengali virdohi he
 This will rip apart the soul of Bengal, as it discriminates between people with the same culture, same language
 ''assam main aag kii vajahek taraf jahaan bengaaliyon ko dharmik aadhaar par bantane kaa dar he, vahiin purvottar ke log isliye virodh pradarshan kar rahe hai kyonki unhen shaq he ki is vidheyak kii vajah se kshetra main bengaaliyon kaa varchasv ho jayega
 Although the bill covers refugees from three countries, but in the northeast, it means illegal Bengali Hindu migrants from Bangladesh who have migrated to different areas
 jab is vidheyak ko pehali baar 2016 main loksabhaa main pesh kiya gaya tha (pehali modi sarkaar is vidheyak ko rajyasabha main paarit nahin kara pai thi or yah nirast ho gaya tha) tab puure ilaake main virodh pradarshan shuru ho gaye the
 In view of the protests, the amended bill excludes parts of the area
 yah vidheyak assam, meghalaya, mizoram yaa tripura ke adivasee kshetron par lagu nahin hoga
 These areas are included in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution and are under the Inner Line Permit (ILP) notified under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations, 1873
 is tarah arunachal pradesh, nagaland or mizoram, lagbhag puraa meghalaya or assam tathaa tripura ke kuch hisson ko is vidheyak ke daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 Shah has announced that ILP will be implemented in Manipur, so the state will also remain outside the purview of the CAB
