 ' Social networking site Facebook has started a graph search option to further improve the search
 graph search ek bade search baar ke taur par yujar ke fasebuk pej ke sabase upar he
 With the help of graph search, it will be easy for the user to find new connections, friends and places
 haalanki graph search abhi sirf britain ke yugers ke liye hi he
 Facebook claims that with graph search you can find Facebook page and friends by their name
 yaa phir kisi khaas shaks, photo, sthaan yaa kuch or dhundne ke liye saadhaaran vaakya kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 For example, if you are looking for your old friends or people whose interests meet you, you can search for something like this: "my friends who live in my town" or "friends of friends who like tennis"
 yahi nahin, aap apni pasandida tasveeron ke alaava aisi tasveeron ko bhi search kar sakate hai jinhen aap dekhakar bhul gaye hon
 For this you need to write in graph search: "photos i have liked," "photos of my family," "photos of my friends taken in Brighton"
 iske alaava aap duusare logon dwaara bataai gayi jagahon or restaurant vagairah ko bhi search kar sakate hai
 For example, "hotels in London visited by my friends", "restaurants in Paris, France, visited by people who live in Paris, France"
 fasebuk kaa kahana he ki graph search naa keval jaankaree hasil karne main lakhon yugers kii madad karata he, balki har kisi ke liye is search kaa anubhav bilkul alag he or yah har samay badalte rahata he
 If you are looking for a holiday idea by writing "photos of my friends in Spain", as your friends share their trip photos, it will be updated
 fasebuk ke mutabik graph search ke jariye yugers keval unheen chizon ko search kar sakate hai, jo unke saath share kii gayi hai
 These include the posts of those who have publicly shared a post, but they are not in your friend list
 fasebuk kaa kahana he ki privesi shortkats or activity log ke jariye aap ye tay kar sakate hai ki aap kise apni share kii hui post dikhaanaa chaahate hai

 Meanwhile, Rizwan Ahmed (rohan Mehra), who trades from Allahabad city, is in Mumbai

 Whenever he felt hungry, he would drink tap water and when it got cold at night, he would spend the night on the mats lying there

 Being fed up with the devils, his parents left him in the forest
 maa-baap ne shuru main to kaha tha ki unka betaa kahin gum gaya he lekin baad main unhone apni galati maan lee
 Yamato was released into the forest by his parents to punish him
 yamato aane-jane vaali gadiyon or logon ko pathar maaraa karata tha, jisase dukhi hokar unke maa-baap ne unhen jangal main chhod diya tha
 Yamato was found near the army's training base
 uske mata-pita ne jahaan use choda tha, ye jagah vahaan se kuch kilometre kii duuri par thi
 It is completely safe, at which time Yamato came in the eyes of military officers, at that time it was absolutely normal

 The officers gave him food and immediately took him to the nearest hospital
 jahaan doctoron ne jaanch ke baad bataaya ki baccha puri tarah thik he
 He had complained of de-hydration and had scratched at some places in the arms and legs
 par sabase chaunkaane vaali baat ye rahi kibaccha bilkul bhi ghabaraaya hua nahin tha
 He was very quiet
 jabaki chah din tak akele jangal main rahanaa koi maamuli baat nahin

 People are giving examples of his morale, endurance and understanding

 According to the police, Yamato's parents may face charges of negligence and may be punished for this

 aapako bataa den ki aaj subah tak maharashtra main congress, shivasena or ensipi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 The three parties had also agreed to make Uddhav Thackeray the CM and it was discussed that today he would formally present a claim to the governor, but in the meantime Ajit Pawar emerged as a 'kingmaker' and the political equation of the state changed
 ajit pavaar(ajit Pawar) sharad pavaar ke bade bhai anantrao pavaar ke bete hai
 He was born on 22 July 1959
 ajit ke pita anantrao mashhoor film nirdeshak ve
 Having worked with Shantaram and he wanted Ajit to make a career in the film industry, but he (ajit Pawar) chose the path of his uncle Sharad Pawar and followed his footsteps to enter politics in 1982

 bihar ke purv mukhyamantri jagannatha mishra ke nidhan par siem nitish kumaar dwaara rajkeey shok kii ghoshnaa karne par rashtriya janata dal (RJD) ke netaa shivanand tiwari (shivanand Tivary) ne apni kadi pratikriya di he
 He has written a post about it on his Facebook page
 jisamen unhone kaha ki pandit jagannatha mishra kii mrityu par nitish sarkaar teen dinon kaa rajkeey shok manaa rahi he
 Jagannath ji along with Lalu ji have been accused in the fodder scam
 balki is ghotaale ke teen maamalon main unako sazaa mil chuki he
 The punishment is five-five years in two cases and three-and-a-half years in one case
 unhone aage likhaa ki nitish ji aksar kaha karte hai ki bhrashtachar, aparaadh or sampradayikta mere liye asahneeya he
 Isn't it glorifying corruption by announcing state mourning for Nitish ji, who is separated from the grand alliance by calling for Lalu ji's corruption! Significantly, this is not the first time that Shivanand Tiwari has attacked Nitish Kumar Be targeted isse pehleshivanand tiwari (shivanand Tivary)ne bihar ke mukhyamantrinithish kumaar (nitish Kumar)par hamalaa kiya tha
 He (shivanand Tivary) on Tuesday said that granting special state status to Bihar for Nitish Kumar is not a question of allegiance, it is just a part of political slogans for him
 shivanand tiwari (shivanand Tivary)ne kaha tha ki main aapako abhi bataa dena chahta hum kinitish kumaar (nitish Kumar)bihar ke liye vishesh rajya kaa darja kaa maamla phir se uthaane vaale hai
 According to their state president, JD-U is going to make it an issue in the next assembly elections
 bahut dinon ke baad nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ne apane baste se vishesh rajya kaa darja nikaala he
 But this is a tried tip of Nitish ji's politics
 lekin yah kargar nuskhaa he, isapar nitish ji ko bhi yaqiin nahin he
 He (shivanand Tivary) had said that Nitish's friend and the country's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has clearly stated that now no state will be categorized as a special state
 yahaan tak kii 15 wein vitt ayog ke adhyaksh or jad you ke bhoot purv saansad shri en ke
 Singh has also clarified that no state now needs special state status for development
 unhone (shivanand Tivary) kaha tha ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane ko lekar agar sach nitish kumaar imaanadaar hote to iske liye unke paas sunaharaa mauqaa tha
 He got that opportunity when he came out of the grand alliance by turning over
 us samay agar unhone narendra modi ji se haath milaane kaa shart vishesh rajya kaa darja rakhaa hota to nishchit rup se vah hasil ho gaya hota
 But in return for the reversal, the Chief Minister remembered his own chair but forgot the status of the special state
 nitish ji ke is abhiyaan ko ham janata ke bich benaqaab karenge
 Significantly, this is not the first time Shivanand Tiwari has attacked Nitish Kumar
 isse pehleunhone (shivanand Tivary) kaha tha ki nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ne kabhi jis narendra modi ko bihar aane se roka tha
 Today, with the help of PM Modi, people are seeking votes
 nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ke paas apana kaam dikhaakar vot maangane ke liye kuch nahin bachaa he
 Shivanand Tivary had said that today Nitish Kumar ji is resorting to his name to save his politics
 yah shodh kaa vishay hoga ki ek samay desh main narendra modi kaa vaikalpik cheharaa maane jane vaale nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) aaj unheen ke saamne sharnaagat kaise ho gaye hai! unhone kaha thi ki nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ko unka ahankaar kha gaya he
 He could not even make his assessment in time
 unke chamachon ne unki soch ko khatm kar diya he
 He (shivanand Tivary) said that the decline of Nitish Kumar has begun

 Shivanand Tivary further wrote that the inhuman and cruel treatment of the girls was in its earlier CBI report

 After becoming Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar went to Muzaffarpur to cut his son's birthday cake
 jis vyakti kaa mukhyamantri ke saath aisa ghanishtha sambandh ho uske dwaara sanchalit kisi sanstha ke viruddh koun sarkari padaadhikari shikaayat karne kaa saahas karegaa"?rashtriya janata dal (RJD) ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari (shivanand Tivary) ne likhaa tha ki agar supreme court is maamle kii sakhti ke saath nigaraanee nahin kar rahaa hota to nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) abtak is maamle kaa rafadpha kar chuke hote
 At first, the police was not registering a case after the investigation
 kaaphi ho hallaa ke baad darj bhi hua to aarope ke mutabik dfaaon me nahin
 Rather in such cases in which one could easily get bail
 supreme court ne thik hi kaha tha nitish sarkaar mujffarpur balika grih ko isiilie paisa de rahi thi taaki vahaan jo ho rahaa tha vah jari rahe
 But the pot of Nitish Kumar's sin is now full

 com / nhwp8tbxts input : ANI The atmosphere of discussions everywhere was hot that many senior players could return to Team India for the upcoming Bangladesh tour
 lekin sirf harbhajan singh ko hi bangladesh kaa tikat mil paaya
 For now, senior players like Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and Ashish Nehra will have to wait for their return to the national team
 lekin bhajji kaa chayan seniors ke liye kisi khushkhabari se kam nahin he
 However, chief selector Sandeep Patil argued that Harbhajan has been recalled to the team keeping Bangladesh batting in mind
 lekin kya yah vajah harbhajan kii vaapasi ke liye kaaphi he?harbhajan sinhane indian premier lig (ipel) main shandaar pradarshan kar sabakaa dhyaan apni ore khinchaa
 Bhajji made 25 of 14 matches in this season of IPL
 75 kii shandaar ausat se 16 wicket liye hai
 But keep in mind that Harbhajan's performance in the last Ranji season was very mediocre
 lekin chayankartaaon ke is kadam se itnaa to saaf ho gaya he ki aane vaale samay main senior khilaadi domestic cricket main agar acha pradarshan karte hai to unke liye bhi team ke daravaaje khul bhi sakate hai
 Changes in BCCI brought relief for seniors After some major changes in BCCI, there are also signs of changes in the team
 shrinivasana and company kaa varchasv ab board main lagbhag khatm hota sa dikhaai de rahaa he
 When the Srinivasan lobby dominated the board, the seniors were reduced to a side-line
 lekin board main badlaav ke saath hi team main harbhajan singh kii vaapasi hui
 And this withdrawal has clearly indicated that if the senior players perform well, they can also return to the team
 maujuuda sachiv anuraag thakur ne saaf taur par kah diya he ki aane vaale samay main board main bhi bade badlaav dekhe ja sakate hai
 Kohli has a great relationship with seniors
 It is not hidden from anyone that every captain wants to keep the player of his choice in the team
 jab emesdhoni testatim ke captain the tab seniors ke liye lagbhag team india ke daravaaje band the
 But after Virat Kohli became captain, Bhajji returned to the team
 chayankarta bhi is baat ko maanate hai ki team sillection main captain kaa bada role rahata he
 Zaheer Khan, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh and Ashish Nehra have a very good relationship with Virat
 aise main agar yah khilaadi domestic main acha pradarshan karte hai or fitness ko banaae rakhte hai to unki bhi team main vaapasi ho sakati he
 Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) is not taking the name of the controversy over the picture of Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah in the hall of the students' union
 nayaa ghatnakram ye he ki haul se jinna tasviir ko philhal hataa diya gaya he
 The argument has been made that the cleaning of the premises is going on, hence the photographs have been removed
 AMU chaatr sangh ke sajaad subhaan rathar kaa kahana he ki safai kii vajah se jinna kii hi nahin duusari tasveeron ko bhi hataaya gaya he
 Sajjad made it clear that all the photographs, including Jinnah, would be repurposed in his own place
 is bich aligarh se bijepi saansad satish gautam ne 'ajtak' ko bataaya ki AMU ke visi ko is sambandh main meri likhi chitthee ke baad uniwarsity prashasan harakat main aayaa he
 According to Gautam, he has told the VC that Jinnah's picture should be sent to Pakistan
 bataa den ki gautam ne visi ko bheji chitthee main poocha tha ki jinna kitasvir uniwarsity main lagaerakhane kii kya majaburi he jabaki jinna desh ke bantwaare ke sutaradhar the
 Gautam hoped that Jinnah's picture would be removed from the university
 yogi sarkaar ke mantri or bijepi netaa swami prasad maury kii ore se jinna kii tasviir ko hataane kii maang ko betuka bataae jane par gautam ne kaha, 'ye unka nijee bayaan he or uskaa party se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Whatever he said, what to do on his statement, the organization will see
 main aligarh se saansad hum, meri jimmedaari aligarh kii he, baaki koun kya bol rahaa he uski meri koi jimmedaari nahin he
 When Gautam was asked about bjp's Rajya Sabha MP Harnath Singh Yadav's demand for action against Saswami Prasad Maurya, he said, "harnath Singh Yadav is a big leader, i praise him, his statement and demand on that The organization will consider
 ' bataa den ki harnath singh yadav ne kaha tha ki jinna kii tasviir ke prakaran main swami prasad maury ne jo kaha he uske liye wo maafee maangen
 If they do not do so, they should be expelled from the party
 aligarh muslim uniwarsity main buudhvaar ko pahunche purv uparashtrapati hamid ansaari se jab jinna kii tasviir se jude vivaad par sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha, 'main phaltu kii chizon par baat nahin karata, jo log raajnneeti kar rahe hai unhen raajnneeti karne do, main das saal raajnneetigyon ke bich rahaa lekin maine kabhi raajnneeti nahin kii'
 Hamid Ansari is being awarded honorary life membership on behalf of AMU Students' Union
 is bich jamiyat ulema hind ke mahasachiv mahmud madani ne jinna kii tasviir ko lekar uthe vivaad par kaha ki iske do pahalu hai
 First thing we are against photographs, portraits, images
 shakhsiyat koi bhi ho lekin uske photo, potrate nahin taange jane chahie
 According to Madani, as far as the picture of Jinnah is concerned, Indian Muslims have already rejected him, his ideas and the partition of India, hence he chose to stay in India instead of going to Pakistan
 madani ne kaha ki unka maananaa he, muslimon se jude sansthaanon main aisi chizon ko nahin rakhaa janaa chahie
 Madani also questioned why this picture was kept there for so long
 madani ne ye bhi kaha ki kisi bahari vyakti ko dakhal kii ijaajat nahin honi chahie, uniwarsity prashasan ko khud hi jinna kaa potrate hataa dena chahie

 Sushma Swaraj commented on Lalu Yadav during his address, saying that the government has 4
 5 fisadi aarakshan ke mudde par unhen murkh banaaya he
 Sushma said that while the CBI has not been relieved of government control, the Lokpal has been tightened
 unhone kaha ki ab sibiai ke ek nahin chaar bos ho jaaenge
 Sushma said that the government's Lokpal bill is full of discrepancies as well as inconsistencies
 unhone kaha ki isamen praavdhaan he ki saansadon ke khilaaf chargeshit daayar bhar hone se lokapal peethasin adhikari (spikar / sabhapati) se karrwai karne ko kah saktaa he
 Sushma said that the Presiding Officer would have to send the Action Taken Report to the Lokpal
 vipaksh kii netaa ne kaha ki is desh main sansad sarvocch he or sadan ke bheetar jis peethasinadhikari ke faisle ko supreme court tak main chunauti nahin di ja sakati, use lokapal ke prati javabdeh hona hoga
 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav has also spoken of withdrawing the bill
 unhone kaha ki is bill ko team anna nahin maan rahi he or naa hi vipakshi party to phir is par teenon dinon tak bahes karne kaa kya matlab
 The government should take it back

 a leader of Pakistan's ruling Pakistan People's Party (PPP) has accused cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan of taking four crore rupees from former military ruler General Pervez Musharraf during the 2002 referendum
 gauratlab he ki isi janamat sangrah ne musharraf ke shashan ko vaid qaraar diya tha
 Raja Riaz, a senior PPP leader and a minister in the coalition government of Pakistan's Punjab province, said, "khan took four crores from General Musharraf for an important role in efforts to maintain dictatorial rule
" ’’ riyaj ne yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki pakistan kii taharik-e-insaaf party ke mukhiya khan ne musharraf shasankaal ke dauraan apane rishtedaaron ko pakistan cricket board main naukari par bhi rakhwaya tha
 He said, "musharraf owes him his favor because of Khan's support
" ’’ riyaj ne iljaam lagaaya ki har vakt jamhuriyat kii baaten karne vaale khan asal main iske khilaaf sajeesh rach rahe hai
 However, Khan's party has rejected Riyaz's allegations, saying she would drag the minister who made such allegations to the court
 idhar kuch samay se imran khan pipipi ke mukhiya or raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari or kendra kii pipipi nit sarkaar kii aalochana karte rahe hai
 Khan recently said that the Pakistan Army should enlist the help of the Supreme Court's decision to repeal the 'national Reconciliation Ordinance' (NRO)
 is adhyadesh ke tahat aapraadhik maamalon main fanse jaradaari or 8,000 anya logon ko kshamaadaan de diya gaya tha
 Khan has also been advocating for mid-term elections as he believes that his party is the only option to get the country out of the crisis
 farvari 2008 main hue aam chunaavon kaa khan kii party ne bahishkaar kiya tha
 Amitabh Bachchan's beautiful granddaughter Navya Naveli may not have ventured into the industry but despite this, she remains in the headlines
 kuch din pehle hi navya ke bollywood main devyue karne kii khabar saamne ai thi
 But now this news has been proved wrong because Navya is going to debut in Paris, not in Bollywood
 darasal 28 november ko paris main hone ja rahefaishan eventree Bal des Débutantes jise Le Bal ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he ismenvyadebue karti najar aaengi
 In this event, Bettiah of world famous celebrities takes part

 bihar main nitish kumaar kii tajposhi un chand raajnneetik ghatnakramon main ek he, jinhone vidaa ho rahe saal main bahusankhya janata ke hriday ko sukun pahunchaaya
 Bihar, which has been entangled in the morass of caste-pant for centuries, this time gave its support to the party, which can be expected to develop
 darasal, vikaas kii daud main anya pradeshon kii tulana main kaaphi pichad chuke bihar ne pichley paanch saalon main vikaas kaa mahaj 'trailor' hi dekha he
 Liked the 'trailer', the public now wants to watch the 'full movie'
 ab yah nitish sarkaar kii naitik va vaidhanik jimmedaari he ki ve janabhaawanaaon ko moort rup de
 In such a situation, the question arises as to what Bihar wants and what it wants first
 isi mudde par ek online voting main janata ne apni raay jaahir kii he
 The question was asked that on which issue should the Nitish government of Bihar pay maximum attention? The options were 'industry', 'education', 'electricity' and 'employment'
 kareeb ek hajaar logon main se sarvaadhik 38 fisadi logon ne praathamikta ke taur par rojgaar ko chunaa, jabaki 27 fisadi logon ne udyog par muhar lagaai
 22 percent of people who make education a priority
 6 rahaa, jabaki pehali jarurat ke taur par 'bijli' ko chunane waalon kaa pratishat 12
 4 darasal vikaas ek samekit prakriya he
 It takes the form of perfection by joining several dimensions
 ek aam aadmi kaa jivan-yaapan rojgaar se hi chalata he, isiilie iskaa pehle sthaan par aana atyant swaabhaavik he
 Those who said the greatest need for the development of the industry would also be seeing it as an employment generating machine
 kabhi jawaharlal nehru ne kal-kaarkaanon ko 'aadhunik bharat ke mandir' qaraar diya tha
 Bihar really needs such 'temples' to run the gallop on the path of development
 shiksha kaa tisare paaydaan par phisal janaa thodi chintaa to paidaa karata hi he, saath hi is maamle main pradesh ke pichhadepan ke liye kuch sanket bhi chodta he
 It is something like that, instead of sending his child to school, he puts it on farm or some work, so that he can earn some money
 shiksha ke abhaav main na to rojgaar kii sunahari tasviir ban paaegi, na hi udyog kaa mukammal phayda aam aadmi tak pahunch saktaa he
 It was about electricity, which was fourth in terms of percentage in other options
 bijli ke abhaav main udyog-dhandhon ke sthapit hone or pragati kaa pahiyaa ghoomane kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati
 Perhaps the darkness born in its absence has created so much darkness in the state so far
 khayr, ab bihar ko bijli chahie, jisase vikaas kii roshni fail sake
 This time is also happy for those who consider Bihar and Uttar Pradesh as the axis of central politics
 shaayad aane vaale dinon main 'vikaas' or 'vot' ek-duusare ke paryaay ban jaaen
 Since the natural disaster in Uttarakhand, governments have focused their attention from the beginning to maintain order in Kedarnath Dham

 samay badalane ke saath dilli mennarendra modior uttarakhand main trivendra singh ravat kii sarkaar ne bhi kedarnath ko praathamikta dete hue yahaan kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 Modi himself first stepped forward for the development of Kedarnath
 yahi vajah he ki is kaam ko puraa karne main jahaan PMO juta hua he vahiin duusari taraf uttarakhand sarkaar ne bhi din-raat ek karke kedarpuri ko nayaa swaroop dena shuru kar diya he
 Kedarnath will now be directly under the vision of Prime Minister Modi's dream project, the nature of Kedarnath has completely changed
 in dinon kedarnath main jor shor se kaary chal rahe hai
 Half a kilometer away from the Kedarnath temple, the walkway has been widened to 50 feet

 Now Baba's temple is visible from half a km away
 is paidal maarg par sthaneey str par taiyaar hone vaale pattharon ko lagaaya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, the front and back sides of the Kedarnath temple have also been widened
 chaudaai badhane se mandir badale swaroop main najar aa rahaa he
 Can stop in the wide campus, now thousands of pilgrims can stay in the temple premises only because the width of the premises of thousands of Yatri Mandir is increased
 kedarnath paidal maarg kaa chaudeekaran pradhanmantri ke dream project main shaamil he
 The walkway has been widened only after the Prime Minister's instructions
 paidal maarg kaa chaudeekaran kaa mukhya udadeshy tirth yatriyon ko dur se hi mandir ke darshan karana he, jisase tirth yatri dur se hi mandir ko dekhen or unhen thakaan kaa ahsaas na ho
 By the way, Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat himself is constantly eyeing to fulfill the dream projects of Prime Minister Modi
 magar PMO se bhi sidhi nazar rakhi ja rahi he taaki kaam main kisi bhi prakaar kii kami ko dekhakar turant nirdesh die ja saken

 kaise kejariwal ke rishtedaar afasaron ko dhamkaakar manmutabik kaam karvaa rahe hai or kaam naa karne par kaise afasaron ko chalata kar diya jaataa he

 In most cases of divorce, you must have heard that the husband has to pay the wife for the upbringing of the children
 lekin yahaan maamla thik ulta he
 The Rohtak court has given an important verdict in a dispute between husband and wife
 is faisle ke tahat patni apni hi beti ke paalan-poshan ke liye har maah pati ko dhai hajaar rupye kharchaa degi
 In this case the husband is the dismissed driver of DTC while the wife is posted as a constable in Delhi Police

 The girl lives with her father

 After this, there was a dispute between Kartar Singh and Mukesh Kumari and on 18 September 2010, Mukesh Kumari lodged a case of dowry harassment and assault against Kartar Singh at Israna police station in Panipat
 mukesh kumari apane sasuraal nahin lauti or bacchee pita ke saath hi rahane lagi

 CBI against Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and 7 others for charges of criminal conspiracy, fraud and criminal misconduct in terms of Section r / w 420 of IPC and Section 13 (2) r / w 13 (1) (d) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
 FIR has been filed
 is baat ko mudda banaate hue bijepi netaa susheel modi ne mangalvaar ko is maamle par apni tippanee jari kii
 According to his statement, the FIR states that between 2010 and 2014, Prem Chandra Gupta's wife, Sarala Gupta, created Delight Marketing Co
 ko shrimati rabari devi or tejasvi yadav ko sthaanantarit kar diya yani jis samay tejasvi yadav company ke maalik bane wo vyask the, unhen dadhi moonch thi
 He was not as reluctant as he claims
 FIR main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki 2014 (jab tejasvi 24 varsh ke the) main jab Delight Marketing ke share puri tarah se tejasvi ko transfer kiye gaye us samay bazaar dar 94 karod tathaa circle rate 32
 Land worth 5 crores was captured for only 65 lakhs
 jab tejasvi yadav naaballig the (16 varsh) us samay unhen kanti singh or raghunatha jha kii karodon kii jameen sahit makaan daan main sweekaar karne main koi hichak nahin hui
 Tejashwi Yadav has a total of 13 properties registered in Gopalganj and Patna
 ye sabhi sampatti us samay registry karai gai jab ve naaballig the
 2 property was registered when he was just 3 years old
 baaki sabhi sampatti jab lalu ji rail mantri the us dauraan tejasvi yadav ke naam registry kii gai jab ve naaballig the
 That is, while he was a minor (nimukh), he collected so much property but at that time he never refused to take the property
 Delight Marketing kii 3 acre jameen jab sarala gupta ne tejasvi ko 2013-14 main saunpi us samay ve dadhi moonch sahit purna balig the
 When Tejashwi took 7 lakh 66 thousand Sq
 On 3 acres of land
 ft
 On May 5, 2016, the agreement for the construction of the 12-storey mall of Bihar with the company of Sursand MLA Dojana was not only a bearded beard but also the Deputy Chief Minister of the state government
 Delight Marketing, AB Exports, AK Infosystem ke madhyam se jab tejasvi dilli evam patna kii 13 anya sampatti (makaan sahit) ke maalik bane us samay tejasvi dudhmuna bachche nahin balki 23 varsh kii umr thi evam purna balig the
 Thus Tejaswi Yadav is the owner of 26 properties
 isamen se 13 sampatti companiyon ke madhyam se he or 13 sampatti jo unke naam se registry hui he
 Out of a total of 26 properties, 13 became owners when they were either double-born children or were studying in 8-9 and 13 became owners when they were 24 years old, bearded and fully adult

 parantu dadhi / moonch hone par 13benami sampatti ke maalikban gaye or funs gaye to kehete hai ki mujhe to us samay dadhi / moonch bhi nahin thi

 Arnold Schwarzenegger seven times Mr

 apni puraani baton ko yaad karte hue aisa hi ek post arnold ne pichley dinon share kiya
 Here's a flashback
 i grew up without running water, so i didn't know what a shower was until i was 15 and joined the gym
 This basin and a washcloth was how we bathed
 My brother and i would schlep the water from the well to the house, and then we would all clean ourselves - first my mother, then my father, then my brother, then me
 The water was a little dirty by the time it was our turn but my brother and i wasn't going to schlep back to the well
 Tell me about the memories from your childhood that remind you how far you've come
 # fbfa post shared by Arnold Schwarzenegger (@schwarzenegger) on Mar 8, 2019 at 12:19 pm PST Arnold Schwarzenegger shared his old memories and wrote that i had never seen water coming out of the tap in my childhood
 By the age of 15, i didn't even know what a shower is
 unhone bataaya ki 15 saal kii umr main maine gym jwine kii to pehali baar showers ko dekha
 Arnold Schwarzenegger shared a picture and said that we used to bathe in this basin
 shwargenegar ke mutabik main or meraa bhai badi mushkilon se kuen se pani laayaa karte the
 Then each member of the family used to clean himself
 pehle maa nahaati thi, phir pita, uske baad meraa bada bhai or aakhir main main (arnold shwargenegar)
 See you at the Santa Monica Pier at noon! Get ready for the world's strongest men, our bravest firefighters, and a beautiful day

 court ne chidambaram ko 26 agast tak sibiai remand par bhejasunwaayee ke dauraan sibbal ne remand kii maang ko kiya tha virobsibbal ne kaha- jaruri nahin ki chidambaram har baat main haa bolennex media bhrashtachar maamle main giraftaar congress netaa pi chidambaram ko sibiai ne guuruuvaar ko dilli kii ek adaalat main pesh kiya
 Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for Chidambaram during the hearing, made several arguments and arguments in his defense, but he failed
 court ne apane faisle main chidambaram ko 26 agast tak sibiai remand par bhej diya he
 Lawyers will be able to meet them for about 30 minutes daily
 hiraasat main rahane ke dauraan parivaar bhi roj keval 30 minute hi mil sakegaa
 Explain that the CBI had questioned Chidambaram and sought his 5-day custody to reveal the 'big conspiracy'
 sibbal ne deen ye dalilenisse pehle hui maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kapil sibbal ne kaha ki is maamle main pehali giraftaar purv kendriya mantri ke bete karti ke chartered acountint bhaskar raman kii hui thi, jo abhi jamaanat par jail se baahar hai
 Sibal said that apart from him, the other accused in the case Peter Mukherjee and Indrani Mukherjee have also got bail but in other case they are in jail
 sibbal ne kaha ki jamaanat pradaan karnaa ek niyam he or adaalat ke samaksh mudda vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa he
 He argued this while opposing the cbi's demand for Chidambaram to be handed over to custody for 5 days for questioning
 darasal, jaanch agency ne badi sajeesh kaa khulaasa karne kii jarurat kaa zikr karte hue adaalat se yah anurodh kiya tha ki chidambaram ko sibiai kii 5 din kii hiraasat mili
 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said during the hearing that Chidambaram was involved in criminal conspiracy with others in the scam
 chidambaram ke khilaaf gaiyr jamaanti warrant jari kiye jane ke baad unhen giraftaar kiya gaya
 Mehta told the court, 'chidambaram is not cooperating in the investigation
 vah apane jawaab main taal-matol kar rahe hai
 Mehta said that this is a serious and big case of money laundering
 unhone kaha ki kisi cheez ke evaj main phayda pahunchaae jane ko ujagar karne ke liye chidambaram ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha karne kii jarurat he
 They need to be confronted with documents
 court main joardaar bahessibiai kii daleelon kaa virodh karte hue sibbal ne daleel di ki agency ne jo kuch kaha he use 'akatya satya' ke taur par nahin liya ja saktaa
 Sibal said that 12 questions were asked to Chidambaram and he has already answered 6 of them
 sibbal ne kaha, 'jaanchakarta nahin jaanate ki kya poochna he or unke paas sawaal bhi taiyaar nahin hai
 After his arrest on Wednesday night, Chidambaram was questioned at 11 am on Thursday
 unhen raat ko sone bhi nahin diya gaya
 During the debate in the court, Chidambaram said that he has not slept for the last 24 hours
 sibbal ne kaha ki gunaah kabool naa karne kaa matlab ye nahin he ki chidambaram sahyog nahin kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, Chidambaram does not necessarily say yes to everything
 agar chidambaram asahyog kar rahe the to hai court ke saamne ye baaten kyon nahin kahin gayi
 Whenever CBI and ED called Chidambaram, he was present
 mehta ne dilli ucch nyaayalay ke faisle kaa bhi zikr kiya, jisamen chidambaram kii agrim jamaanat yachika khaarij kii gai he
 He said that the charge sheet has not been filed in this case so far and this is the stage before the filing of the charge sheet
 unhone kaha, 'isliye, hamen saamagree kii jarurat he jo chidambaram ke paas he
 "he argued," it would be possible to have an effective investigation if questioned in custody
 ' a female employee had recently made serious allegations of sexual exploitation on GM of Air India
 peedita ne is sambandh main pradhanmantri narendra modi, naagarik uddyan mantri suresh prabhu or naagarik uddyan rajyamantri jayant sinha ko chitthee bhi likhi thi
 However, no one other than Suresh Prabhu sent a reply to the victim's letter
 vahiin suresh prabhu kaa nirdesh itnaa chaltau kism kaa rahaa ki air india ne aaropee GM ke khilaaf koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya
 Now, on behalf of the victim, a group of former Air India employees has again written a complaint letter to Suresh Prabhu and Women and Child Welfare Minister Maneka Gandhi
 purv karmchaariyon kii is chitthee main kaha gaya he ki maamle kii jaanch ke liye alag se samiti gathit nahin kii gai, jiske chalate airlines management phir se puure maamle ko dabaane main lag gaya he
 Not only this, Aruna Gopalakrishnan, chairman of the Internal Complaint Committee of the airlines, has also been accused of taking the side of the accused GM
 itnaa hi nahin peedita ke mutabik, airlines management ne suresh prabhu ke ulat bayaan die
 The situation happened for the victim and the letter stated that the steps taken by Suresh Prabhu to say that the victim should be given justice are not enough, but make the working conditions worse for the victim
 bataaya gaya he ki yon shoshan ke aaropee jiem captain darryl pes ke kukarmon ko ab tak chhupaati aa raheen isisi kii cheirperson aruna gopalkrishnan ko in flite sarvice department kaa prabhaar saunp diya gaya he
 The complainant states that it is in fact a pseudo-administration which will take the side of the accused officer only after the news related to it slows down in the media, but will be acting on the instructions of the same
 jaanch bithaane ke baavjood pad par bane hue hai aaropee gmsikayawakarwa kii chitthee se spasht he ki kai mahila karmchaariyon kaa yon shoshan karne kaa aarope lagane or jaanch bithaae jane ke baavjood aaropee adhikari ko uske pad se nahin hataaya gaya he, jo vishakha guidelins kaa ulanghan he
 The complainant woman made her first complaint to the ICC on 27 August last year
 us samay isisi siemdi lohani the
 However, within a few hours of receiving the complaint, Lohani was transferred and no one paid any attention to the complaint after Lohadi left
 is bich internal complaint kamity kii adhyaksh aruna gopalkrishnan ne yah kahkar shikaayat ko darkinar karne kii koshish kii ki 'to isse kya, captain darryl mujhase bhi to flert karte hai
 'the accused officer has so much authority, in this letter, he has explained in detail how the accused officer has been escaping despite committing such a serious crime of sexual exploitation of Air India GM Captain Daryl Pesakhir Airlines
 chitthee main bataaya gaya he ki darasal captain darryl pes ke paas itane prashasnic adhikaar hai ki koi bhi unke khilaaf khadey hone kaa saahas hi nahin kar paata
 There are around 300 employees under Captain Daryl Pace, of which 75 per cent are women
 aaropee adhikari har tarah kii aatanrik jaanch ke maamalon main disiplinary athurity or apil athurity bhi hai
 He is the head of the Pilots Welfare Fund, which provides pilots with their salaries
 vah in flite services, jisamen manoranjan, vardi or hotel ke kharche bhi aate hai, ke liye nikalne vaale tenders ko apruv karte hai
 The construction of crew manual and framing of new rules is also in the hands of the accused officer
 itnaa hi nahin vah payalton ko chunane vaali payalts ricrotment board ke sadsy bhi hai or cabin kru ricrotment panel kaa chayan bhi vahi karte hai
 The crew members are also selected for the deployment of the Prime Minister and President of the country in VVIP flights

 The obscene statements made by the accused officer clearly indicate that only those employees in the office are benefited by the sexual favors
 shikayatakarta ke mutabik, aaropee adhikari khuleam duusare tamaam karmchaariyon ke saamne hi kisi mahila karmchaaree ke guptangon, apni sex gatividhiyon or sex ruchiyon ke bare main tippaniyan karte rahete hai

 Shatrughan Sinha, who rebelled against the BJP and joined the Congress, is in the fray from Patna Sahib seat in Bihar and his wife Poonam Sinha has landed in the battlefield of Lucknow from the Samajwadi Party
 shatrughna ke saamne ek taraf party dharm he to duusari taraf patni dharm
 In such a situation, he is seen giving more importance to wife religion than party
 yahi vajah he ki pehle punam sinha ke namakan main lakhanu main road sho kiya or ab congress ke khilaaf va sapa ke paksh main patni ke liye vot maangane utre hai
 SP against Rajnath in Lucknow Lok Sabha seat, Poonam Sinha, wife of Shatrughan Sinha, who recently joined BJP and joined Congress, is in the fray and Acharya Pramod Krishnam is contesting from Congress
 aise main guuruuvaar ko shatrughna sinha ne punam sinha ke paksh main prachaar karne utre or sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke saath manch saajha kar congress ke khilaaf vot maanga
 Not only this, he praised Akhilesh Yadav and BSP President Mayawati fiercely
 sapa pratyaashee punam sinha ke liye shatrughna sinha ke dwaara prachaar karnaa congress pratyaashee acharya pramod krishnam ko nagavar gujara
 He expressed his displeasure by tweeting and said, 'it seems from Shatrughan Sinha's antics that he has joined Congress but has not resigned from RSS yet
 ' acharya pramod krishnam ne shatrughna ko sidhe taur par sangh ke khemen main khadaa kar diya he
 Actually, Shatrughan Sinha had also joined Poonam Sinha's nomination earlier
 is dauraan unhone lakhanu main road sho bhi kiya tha
 Not only this, during this time Shatrughan had said that if there is a Prime Minister then it should be like Akhilesh Yadav or Mayawati, who have ability and readiness to work
 akhilesh yadav main bahut kshamtaayen or yuva shakti ke pratik hai
 They have done a great job
 main unhen sirf uttar pradesh ke bhavishya nahin balki kabhi-kabhi to desh ke bhavishya ke rup main bhi dekhtaa hum or pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar ke rup main dekhtaa hum
 While the party president Rahul Gandhi from the Congress is being described as a contender for the post of Prime Minister
 rahul gandhi bhi kai baar khulkar pradhanmantri banane kii ichha jaahir kar chuke hai
 Promoting such Shatrughna for SP and calling Akhilesh suitable for the Prime Minister is going to the Congressmen exasperating
 lakhanu se congress ke tikat par lard rahe acharya pramod krishnam ne shatrughna sinha ke khilaaf naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kaha tha, 'shatrughna sinha apni patni ke prachaar ke liye aae hai, meraa unase kahana he ki wo party dharm nibhaaen or mere liye bhi ek din chunaav prachar karen
 However Shatrughan has not given importance to the talk of Acharya Pramod Krishnam
 yahi vajah he ki wo dobaaraa se lakhanu main congress ke khilaaf raily kar sapa ke liye vot maang rahe hai
 Interestingly, Shatrughan Sinha has been uncomfortable in the party since 2014 while staying in the BJP
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah par lagaataar sawaal khadey kar rahe hai or vipaksh ke netaaon ke saath sur main sur mila rahe the
 Due to this, the party cut his ticket and gave ticket to Ravi Shankar Prasad from Patna Sahib
 isi ke baad unhone congress kaa daaman thama or patna sahib seat se chunavi maidan main hai or unki patni punam sinha sapa se lakhanu kii pratyaashee hai
 Shatrughan's campaigning in favor of his wife has become a sore throat for the Congress candidate

 com / m9hmziw8s1 The end of the 17-year-old alliance of the BJP-JDU is a major setback for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
 2004 main gathbandhan ke satta se baahar hone ke baad iske kai sahyogiyon ne saath chhod diya he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was one of the founding members of the NDA, who wrote the script to break the alliance after Narendra Modi was made the chairman of the election campaign committee in the BJP
 varsh 1996 main samta party endie main shaamil hui thi, jiske mukhya netaa nitish or jorge furnandis the
 The Samata Party leader later joined the JDU 
 endie kii sarkaar main furnandis rakshaamantri the, jabaki nitish kumaar ko railway kaa prabhaar diya gaya tha
 Sharad Yadav, who left the NDA convenor post on Sunday, was given charge of the aviation ministry in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
 furnandis tab endie ke sanyojak hua karte the or sarkaar ke niti niyantaaon main shaamil the
 Interestingly, Nitish did not criticize the post-godhra riots and remained in the NDA government
 2003 main unhone narendra modi kii prashansa kii thi or kaha tha ki bhavishya main vah rashtriya raajnneeti main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayenge
 However LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan left the NDA cabinet after the 2002 Gujarat riots
 isse pehle varsh 2000 main nitish bihar ke mukhyamantri bane the, lekin khandit janadesh or bahumat sabit nahin karne ke kaaran unhen saat dinon ke andar istipha dena padaa tha
 The BJP and JDU contested the 2004 Lok Sabha elections as a coalition and won five and six seats respectively in Bihar
 varsh 2005 main jediu-bijepi ne bihar main vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet hasil kii or nitish mukhyamantri bane
 The coalition defeated RJD, LJP and Congress in the 2010 elections
 jediu ne 115 siton par jeet darj kii, jabaki bijepi ko 91 siten milin
 The alliance also performed well in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and while JDU got 20 seats, BJP won 12 seats
 baharhaal pehle bhi aise kshan aae jab gathbandhan main tanaav hua or kai logon ne sambhaavna jataai ki yah tut saktaa he
 In 2009, BJP mlas revolted against their leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi
 unhone aarope lagaae ki vah kaaphi vinamr hai or hameshaa nitish ke ishaare par naachte hai
 He demanded that the alliance should be disbanded, but he was persuaded by the central leaders and the matter settled
 tippaniyan The alliance again came under threat in June 2010, when the BJP national executive met in Patna and local newspapers published advertisements of Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar joining hands on the same platform
 nitish kumaar tab tak modi or hindutv kii unki chhavi ko lekar aapatti jataane lage the or nakhushi jataane ke liye bijepi netaaon kaa ratribhoj radd kar diya tha
 Modi dominated the Patna conference, which angered Nitish and others
 modi ne mukhyamantriyon ke sammelan ke saath hi endie kii sabhaaon main bhi hameshaa nitish se sampark ke liye kadam badhaane kaa prayaas kiya, lekin nitish ne hameshaa anichhaa vaali muskuraahat se jawaab diya
 The JDU-BJP alliance had started falling apart when Nitish asked the bjp's top leadership to clarify whether Modi would be the Prime Ministerial candidate on his behalf
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar endie ke sansthaapak sadasyon main rahe, jinhone bijepi main narendra modi ko chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa adhyaksh banaae jane ke baad gathbandhan todane kii patakatha likhi
 In 1996, the Samata Party joined the NDA, whose main leaders were Nitish and George Fernandes
 samta party ke netaa baad main jediu main shaamil ho gaye the
 Fernandes was the defense minister in the NDA government, while Nitish Kumar was given the charge of the railway
 ravivaar ko endie kaa sanyojak pad chhodane vaale sharad yadav ko atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar main uddyan mantralay kaa prabhaar diya gaya tha
 Fernandes was then the convenor of the NDA and was one of the policymakers of the government
 dilachasp baat he ki nitish ne godhra baad ke dangon kii aalochana nahin kii thi or endie sarkaar main bane rahe
 In 2003, he praised Narendra Modi and said that in future he would play an important role in national politics
 haalanki lojpa ke adhyaksh ramvilas paswan ne 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke baad endie cabinet chhod diya tha
 Earlier in 2000, Nitish became the Chief Minister of Bihar, but due to the fractured mandate and not proving majority, he had to resign within seven days
 bijepi or jediu ne 2004 kaa loksabhaa chunaav gathbandhan ke taur par ladaa tha or bihar main unhen kramash: paanch or chah siten mili thim
 In 2005, JDU-BJP won the assembly elections in Bihar and Nitish became the Chief Minister
 gathbandhan ne argedy, lojpa or congress ko 2010 ke chunaavon main karaari shikast di
 JDU won 115 seats, while BJP got 91 seats
 gathbandhan ne 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi acha pradarshan kiya or jediu ko jahaan 20 siten milin, vahiin bijepi ko 12 siton par jeet mili
 However, there were moments before when there was tension in the alliance and many people expressed the possibility that it could break
 2009 main bijepi vidhayakon ne apane netaa or upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ke khilaaf hi baghawat kar di thi
 He alleged that he was very polite and always danced at the behest of Nitish
 unhone maang kii ki gathbandhan tod diya janaa chahie, lekin kendriya netaaon ne unhen manaa liya or maamla shant ho gaya
 The comments gathbandhan june, 2010 main phir khatre main pad gaya, jab patna main bijepi ke rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak hui or sthaneey akhabaaron main narendra modi or nitish kumaar ke ek hi manch par haath milakar khadey hone ke vigyaapan chape
 Nitish Kumar had by then raised objections to Modi and his image of Hindutva and canceled the dinner of BJP leaders for expressing unhappiness
 patna sammelan main modi chhaae rahe, jisase nitish or naaraaz ho gaye
 Modi always tried to step in to contact Nitish at the NDA meetings as well as the Chief Ministers Conference, but Nitish always responded with a reluctant smile
 jediu-bijepi gathbandhan tabhi se tuutata dikhaai dene laga tha, jab nitish bijepi ke sheersh netritv se yah spasht karne ko kehane lage ki kya modi unki taraf se pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar honge

 rimjhim barasati boonden hon yaa aag ugalta suraj, chhatari donon hi mausam main apni jarurat kaa ahsaas karaate hue aapkaa bachaav karti he
 The colorful chhatris, which have become synonymous with fashion, have been making their existence in different forms not only from today but for centuries
 barish ke mausam main ghar se baahar nikalnaa ho to haath chhatari kii talash pehle karte hai
 If the umbrella is forgotten at home and it rains on the way, then it comes out of the mouth 'I wish the umbrella was not forgotten
 ’ ramajas kalege kii chaatra arpita singh kahati hai ‘garmi main chhatari dhoop se bachaane ke kaam aati he
 But walking with an umbrella in the rain is more fun
 pichley saal barish ke mausam main meri chhatari gum ho gai
 i bought a second umbrella because without it the work is not going to work in the rain and summer
 ’ek sarkari karyaalay main clerk kanta dube kahati hai ‘maine to offis main apane daraaj main ek chhatari rakhi hui he
 You can take an umbrella while leaving the house in the rain, but if you forget, it becomes difficult while returning from office
 meraa ghar vaise bhi bas stand se dur he
 It is difficult to say when the umbrella came into existence
 lekin pracheen itihaas main raja maharaajaaon ke peeche unke anucharon ke chhatari lekar chalane kaa zikr miltaa he
 In historical photographs too, the emperors are seen carrying an umbrella over the heads of the Maharajas
 kaha ja saktaa he ki kisi jamaane main chaataa shahi sammaan kaa bhi pratik hota tha
 In different countries, the chhatris were used in different forms according to the needs of the people
 bharat ke saath saath misr, yunaan tathaa china kii pracheen kalakritiyon main chaate kii chhavi spasht taur par dikhaai detii he
 Given the importance of the umbrella, some countries have named it one day
 in deshon main 10 farvari ko ‘‘ambrella de’’ manaaya jaataa he
 Girdharilal Gupta, director of an umbrella shop in Sarojini Nagar area, says, "earlier there were black umbrellas that were large and could not be folded
 bujurgon ke liye ye chaate chadi kii tarah sahaara dene kaa kaam bhi karte the
 Now comes the folding umbrellas
 inhen mode kar aasaani se bag main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 'he explains' the price of umbrellas is according to their quality
 ab barish main dupahiyaa vaahan chalaane vaale log barsaati yani rain kot lenaa zyada pasand karte hai
 It is easy to drive a two-wheeler wearing a rain coat while a two-wheeler cannot be driven while handling an umbrella
 ’ arpita kahati hai ki tej hawa main chhatari ulat bhi jaati he
 "folding umbrellas are fragile," she says
 tej hawa main ye ulat jaati hai
 'chhatri is not only a part of the life of the common man, but it has also made its place in films
 film ‘‘chalbaaj’’ main shridevi or sani deol ko paardarshee chhatari le kar ‘‘na jane kahaan se ai he’ geet par thirakate dekha ja saktaa he
 Preeti Zinta and Hrithik Roshan carried an umbrella in 'koi Mil Gaya'
 
 The song appears to be swinging in the rain
 agar gwalior ke sindhiya gharaane kii baat ho to chhatari kaa matlab badal jaataa he
 In the Scindia palace, there is a mausoleum in a part where under the umbrellas are the tombstones of the late members of the Scindia dynasty
 ek saal baad hi urja sambandhi nitigat maamalon kii jaanch-padtaal karnaa koi samajhadaari nahin he
 This is not a subject that can be evaluated from a short-term perspective
 isamen rukh badalane ke liye lanbaa samay chahie hota he or vah bhi kai anischitataaon se bharaa hota he
 Despite this advice, i am trying to do the same and look at the performance of the Narendra Modi administration in the energy sector in the last one year
 ek saal pehle maine isi prakaashan ke anurodh par nai sarkaar ke liye urja kshetra kii apekshaaon kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya tha
 That bundle of suggestions included fossil fuels, renewable energy, regulation, subsidies, pricing, taxation and legislation, all issues
 mere sujhaavon main sabase ahm ye theah pradhanmantri ko ek 'urja suraksha or javabdehi kanoon' paarit karnaa chahie taaki urja ko saat alag-alag mantralayon ke bante-bante nazariye se dekhne kii jagah ek samgr or ekikrut drushti se dekhne ke liye nitigat aadhaar ban sake
 Their administration should remove the bottlenecks in the system to accelerate the production of fossil fuels and create a competitive and market-linked price and taxation framework
 or aakhirkaar, unhen arthvyavastha ko kam-carbon utsarjan vaale vikaas ke raste par le janaa chahie
 a year later, i am excited by the steps of the Modi government
 us bahuuddeshy urja kanoon ke bare main to koi baat nahin hui he lekin ek ekikrut urja niti ko taiyaar karne kii disha main kadam uthaae gaye hai
 These will lead the economy on the path of clean and low carbon-intensive economic growth
 sarkaar ne koyala udyog main bhi nai jaan foonki he
 The laggard has been the petroleum sector only
 uski tarakkee main yah susti hairaan karne vaali he kyonki tel or gas ke utpaadan main vruddhi kaa khaakaa to acchhee tarah paribhaashit he
 My recommendation to Prime Minister Modi to bring an 'energy Security and Accountability Bill' was based on the fact that energy security and energy sustainability are very important issues but no institutional mechanism exists to formulate an integrated energy policy
 aapurti se jude masalon ko saat mantralay dekhte hai
 Issues related to demand (conservation and energy efficiency) are looked after by many departments of these ministries, while the operation and distribution structure (like railways, ports, pipelines, distribution and supply) is looked after by many bodies which are either autonomous or state and center
 Are spread under several entities of governments
 isi sansthagat shoonyata ko bharne ke liye maine urja par ek vidheyak kaa suzav diya tha
 This was always to be seen as an additional recommendation, so it is no surprise that the Prime Minister did not take any action on it
 lekin unhone faisla lene kii prakriya main jami padi kai sari paraton ko todgaye kii disha main kadam uthaae hai
 He has delegated the Ministries of Energy, New and Renewable Energy and Coal to a single minister, and has recently prepared an inter-ministerial Forum at the level of secretaries to increase coordination and expedite clearances
 petroleum ab bhi ek alag mantralay he or usamen filein ab bhi lambavat dhaanche main safar karti hai lekin ab ek samgr daayre main urja niti par vichaar karnaa aasaan ho gaya he
 Commitment on clean energy Another positive thing is that clean energy, especially solar and wind energy, is being given attention
 svachh urja fund ke vittaposhan ke liye koyala utpaadan par upkar 50 ru
 Rs 100 per tonne to Rs
 prati ton kar diya gaya he
 The fund was established some time ago to support research and development in clean energy technology
 philhal yah dekhnaa baaki he ki is tarah se jo dhan jutaya ja rahaa he, use prabhavi rup se istemaal kiya jaataa he yaa nahin
 But this is indicative of the government's intentions towards developing low carbon emission technologies and making them commercial
 iske aage sarkaar ne saura or pawan urja ke liye bade mahatvakankshi lakshya nirdhaarit kiye hai
 It is intended that the current solar capacity in the country over the next decade 2
 5 megawatt se badhaakar 100 gigawatt kar diya jaae or pawan urja kii kshamta ko 25 gigawatt se badhaakar 50 gigawatt kar diya jaae
 At first glance, this goal is impossible
 pehali baat to yah he ki iske liye pichley pradarshan main behad chamatkaarik sudhaar chahie
 Yet the average rate of annual growth in renewable energy capacity is 1-1
 5 gigawatt kii hi rahi he
 Now, the government will have to increase the capacity of solar power by 19 GW and that of wind power by 6 GW every year to achieve its target
 bhoomi adhigrahan or pariyojna kii manjuuri ke sandarbh main yah apane aap main pariyojna prabandhan ke lihaaj se hi ek mahati chunauti he
 Secondly, grid related problems will also arise
 grid kaa maujuuda dhaancha alag-alag or betaratib electron ke vyapak pravaah ko sah paane main sakasham nahin he
 It will need to be upgraded and it will cost more than $ 100 billion
 baavjood iske, mujhe is baat kii khushi he ki sarkaar ne jamini str par itani mahatvakankshi yojana kaa daanv khelaa he
 This indicates a strong commitment towards clean energy and a desire to move towards a non-fossil fuel based energy system
 aisi vyavastha kii taraf badaae main kai saal lagenge
 So, in the short term, our priority should be to reduce dependence on oil, gas and coal imports
 is disha main sarkaar kaa record mila-jula rahaa he
 He may have given new life to coal but he has not shown much interest in oil and gas
 koyala kshetra kii gati main sakaaratmak sudhaar dikhaai de rahaa he
 The bidding process for 31 coal blocks has been successfully completed
 bhale hi kai log yah daleel den ki bikri kii daren vaazib mulya par aadhaarit nahin hai or khanan license paane vaali kai companiyon ke liye apni patibaddhtaon par khara utarana tedi kheer sabit hoga, lekin yah tay he ki yah kshetra ek oonche vikaas kii raah par bad chalaa he
 Production growth in the first quarter of this financial year was in double digits compared to the same period last year
 haalanki deshi arakshit nidhi ko puri tarah se or nirantarata ke saath istemaal karne ke liye abhi bahut kuch kiya janaa baaki he
 In particular, the government will have to follow its commitment to triple coal production on the one hand and the double-edged sword of controlling air pollution on the other
 pradooshan behad ghaatak str tak pahunch chukaa he or hamaare 13 shaharon ko duniya ke sabase pradooshit shaharon main shumaar kiya jaataa he
 In addition to meeting the physical goals of coal production, a commitment to clean coal and its emissions must also be made
 or dhul phank rahi he kelkar reportpetroleum kshetra kii tasviir kuch dhundhlee he
 In terms of performance standards, there is very little improvement
 tel or gas ke utpaadan main vruddhi nahin hui he
 The intensity of discovery of 20 wells per thousand square kilometers is the lowest in the world
 nai khoj licencing niti (enielpi 10) ne abhi tak ujaale kii kiran nahin dekhi he
 Companies still complain of delays and disruptions at the hands of the bureaucracy
 vitaran or aapurti dhaanche ke sudhaar main bhi behad kam nivesh hua he
 Only one notable success has been seen and that too in the lower sector
 sarkaar ne tel kii antarrashtriya keemton main giravat kaa acha istemaal sabsidiyon main katautee karne or parivahan eendhanon (dijal tathaa petrol) kii keemton ko niyantran mukt karne main kiya he
 It is not entirely clear why the petroleum sector is so lethargic
 koi vyavasthaagat aadchan nahin thi or sarkaar ke paas vijay kelkar samiti kii report ke rup main is baat kaa blue print maujuud tha ki khoj or utpaadan main teji laane ke liye kya kiya janaa chahie
 Perhaps it was the bureaucratic reluctance to overcome issues related to high-profile companies
 shaayad iske peeche gale kii keemton kii raajnneeti thi
 Or maybe it was just official stubbornness
 kaaran jo bhi rahaa ho, hakeekat yahi he ki antarrashtriya or gharelu visheshgyon se vyapak salaah-mashvire ke baad kai vyaavhaarik siforishein dene vaali kelkar samiti kii report ko sire se taak par rakh diya gaya or na to maujuuda tel kshetron main recovery kii dar badhaane or na hi nae tel kshetron kii khoj kaa kaam tej karne kii disha main koi pahal kii gai
 As a result, there is no sign of any improvement in the production of oil and gas in the last year
 nishkarsh ke taur par mujhe agle saal par najar daalane dijie
 Given that petroleum is an important factor in economic development, i suggest that the government sweep the dust from the Kelkar Committee report and implement some of its most important recommendations (I should mention here that i Was a member of the committee) -new discovery licensing cycle (NELP10) to be announced based on the cost recovery production participation model, not the bidable revenue-sharing model On the basis that it will end the interest of investors
 -gas kii keemton ko bazaar se joda jaae or iskaa spasht or paardarshee rasta tay kiya jaae
 -gail be tasked to develop a national pipeline gas grid
 -sebi kii tarj par hydrocarbon mahanideshek ko bhi niamak ke rup main swaittata mili

 Mulayam Singh Yadav has once again given a controversial statement on the Ayodhya firing
 mulaayam singh ne kaha he ki agar desh kii ekta kii khatir zyada logon ko bhi maarna padataa to wo peeche nahin hatate
 Controversial statement on Ayodhya, Mulayam Singh said on the occasion of his birthday that during his chief ministership in the year 1990, 28 people were killed in firing on kar sevaks for the unity of the country
 agar ham masjid nahin bachaate to, us daur ke kai muslim naujavaanon ne hathiyaar uthaa liye the
 Mulayam said that despite this, the party got 105 seats in the next election and formed the government, whereas in the last assembly election, the SP got just 47 seats, which is a shame
 muslim noujvaan ke haath main hathiyaarmulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki jab ayodhya main goliyaan chalin 20 log mare or 80 ghayal hue
 Advani said 56 died
 ham ne kaha atal ji agar suchi de den to ham pair pakad kar maafee maangenge
 But after 6 months, it is known that 28 have died, so they helped them
 desh kii ekta ke liye agar zyada maarna padataa to maarthe
 Mulayam called for Muslim youth, saying that if the mosque was not saved, then today Muslim youth would have weapons in their hands, what benefit is there when the mosque does not exist
 bete ko arshivaad, par khinchaai bhimulaayam singh ne janmdin par apane bete or upi ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko khulkar aashirwad diya or kaha ki akhilesh pehle meraa betaa he, phir netaa
 So my blessings will always be on him, but at the same time, Mulayam Singh, while addressing the mistakes of his son, said that in the last assembly election only 47 seats were won, who is responsible for this
 purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii maujuudagi main party netaaon ko jamkar naseehat dete hue mulaayam ne kaha ki sapa ko aaj bhi musalamaanon kaa utana hi samarthan hasil he, jitna pehle tha
 The Muslims have not left the SP, but the party leaders could not get their votes
 chunaav main jitne bhi musalamaanon ne vot diya he, unamem se 90 pratishat ne sapa ko hi diya he
 Mulayam Singh said that you need to do some work and hard work after Samajwadi Party's defeat in the last assembly
 muslim samaaj ne sabase zyada samaajawaadee party ko vot diya he
 Mulayam Singh gave this advice to the party
 
 
 1
 Despite being with the Muslims, the Samajwadi Party did not get votes from them
 lihaaja party ko or bhi mehnat karne kii jarurat he

 aamtaur par musalmaan sapa ke saath sahanubhuti rakhata he, lekin maujuuda halaat ko aap kaise thik karoge, booth kaise chalavaaoge, aisa unki musiibat main saath dekar hi sambhav he

 During the meeting of the National Integration Council, something happened on Monday after which political questions are being raised about the relationship of Narendra Modi, Nitish Kumar and LK Advani

 Read: pm-mujaffarnagar, who spoke in the meeting, sentenced those responsible for the violence soon
 Advani and Nitish met each other warmly
 yah patrakaron ke liye photo monmet bhi tha
 From the attitude of the two leaders, it seemed that they were meeting freely
 vahiin, baithak main narendra modi ke na aane se is mulaakaat ke siyaasi myne bhi nikaale ja rahe hai
 Let me tell you that Nitish Kumar is seen as a strong opponent of Modi
 jediu ne modi kii vajah se hi endie se alag hone kaa faisla kiya tha, kyonki party kaa kahana tha ki unhen piem pratyaashee ke taur par modi sweekaar nahin
 At the same time, Advani's displeasure with Modi is well known

 " barsaat ke mausam main sillen or nami kii vajah se gahanon ke kaale padane yaa chamak udne kii sambhaavnaaen kaaphi zyada rahati hai
 This happens due to negligence in the maintenance of jewelry
 yadi aap monsoon main aabhushanon kii thik se hifaazat karnaa chaahate hai to neeche die gaye 5 tips jarur follow karen
 1
 sabase pehle yah jaananaa jaruri he ki barish main kis tarah ke aabhushan kharaab hote hai
 Gold or platinum jewelery does not require much care
 lekin chaandi ke aabhushan aasaani se prabhavit ho jate hai
 Therefore, silver jewelry has to be cared more during this season
 2
 While keeping ornaments, people usually keep them wrapped in cloth, which causes them to turn black
 iske liye jewelery box kaa istemaal karen or isamen silica packet rakhen
 The silica packet absorbs moisture and does not allow your jewelery to deteriorate
 3
 If you are not able to arrange things like jewelery box or silica packet then you can also use a cotton cloth instead
 nami ko sokhne main sooti kapadaa bhi kaaphi kargar he
 4
 aabhushan kaale pad jane par unki safai garm pani se karen or saaf coton se ponchhein
 After this let them dry for a while in open air

 The job of ministers in government is to take policy decisions and the task of officers is to implement those decisions
 lekin kya afasar itane belgaum ho sakate hai ki wo kendra sarkaar ke cabinet mantri kii bhi naa sunen
 It sounds strange to hear, but Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan publicly considered himself compelled to face the bureaucracy
 unhone kaha ki kaha ki upabhokta ke hiton kii raksha karne ke liye kiye gayi unke faislon ko lagu karne main afasar kotahi barat rahen he or baar-baar kehane ke baad bhi sun nahin rahe hai
 a press conference of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs was convened in Delhi on Monday to mark the three-year achievements of the ministry
 ramvilas paswan ek ke baad ek apane mantralay ke kiye kaam-kaaj kaa bakhaan kar rahe the
 But when the 'aaj Tak' reporter asked that Paswan's decisions were being air-borne and not being enforced on the ground, Paswan got angry with his officers
 kendriya mantri paswan se poocha ki us faisle kaa kya hua jisamen unka mantralay companiyon ko ye nirdesh dene vaala tha ki har cheez par uski menuphaccharing or expyri date saaf-saaf or bade aksharon main likhi jaae taaki upabhokta dhokhaa nahin khaaen
 Paswan said angry that he had said that the ISI mark, manufacturing and expiry date and quantity or weight should be clearly written on the food items
 lekin jane kyon afasar baar-baar kehane ke baad bhi isko sakhti se lagu karaane main hila-hawali kar rahe hai
 He told his ministry officials present on the stage during the press conference that within a month it should be implemented in all circumstances
 chaahe khaane pine kii chizon par expyri date likhane kaa maamla ho, emarpy se zyada keemat vasuulne kaa, bhraamak vigyaapan yaa phir restraan main sarvice chargeej vasuulne kaa, upabhokta maamalon ke mantri ram vilaas paswan ke kai faislon ko lekar charchaa to khub hui lekinahakeekat main zyada badlaav nahin hua
 When asked about this, Paswan merely said that he did not even want to take such a strict step that people would start saying that the police has been ruled
 paswan ne somvaar ko bataaya ki garib logon ko ab rashan main phir se chini di jaaegi

 van rank van pension kii maang ko lekar sena ke purv sainik ramkishan greval kii aatmahatya ko lekar vivaad abhi thama bhi nahin tha ki dilli ke jantar mantar par ardhsainik balon ke ritred karmi apni maangon ko lekar dharne par baith gaye
 Ex-servicemen are protesting at Jantar Mantar for about 500 days
 ardhsainik balon main 12 lakh karmi seva main or 8 lakh karmi ritred hai jinaki shikaayat he ki wo duty or jimmedaari to sena ke jawan se kam nahin nibhaate lekin baat jab suvidhaon or vetan kii aati he to unhen peeche kar diya jaataa he
 The extent is that in a difficult situation like Ladakh, the personnel of paramilitary forces get about 20 per cent allowance in comparison to army personnel doing duty in one place
 tippaniyan Moreover, in the difficult situation ranging from terrorism, army personnel get an allowance of two thousand rupees and officer six thousand rupees every month, whereas paramilitary personnel do not get anything like this
 isi kaa nateeja he ki sena ke ek jawan or ardhsainik balon ke jawan kii tankhwaah main aath se das hajaar rupee kaa antar ho jaataa he
 They also have a complaint that when they die while fighting terrorists from the border, the status of a martyr is not destined
 saath main parivaar waalon ko sena kii tulana main kareeb aadha hi aarthik madad milti he
 After 2004, even pension is not available
 inaki maang he ki inhen bhi van rack van pension mili or lagbhag wo sari suvidhaayen milen jo sena ke javaanon ko milti hai
 For this, these people have given 60 days to the government or else they will start the movement again
 jantar mantar par hi purv sainik kareeb 500 dinon se dharna prardashan kar rahe hai
 There are 12 lakh personnel in the paramilitary forces and 8 lakh in the service, who complain that they do not play duty and responsibility less than army personnel, but when it comes to facilities and salaries, they are pushed back
 had to yah he ki ladakh jaise mushkil halaat main ek hi jagah duty karne par sena ke jawan kii tulana main ardhsainik balon ke javaanon ko kareeb 20 fisadi bhatta miltaa he
 The comments or to or aatankwaad se lekar mushkil halaat main sena ke jawan ko har maheene do hajaar or adhikari ko chah hajaar rupee bhatta miltaa he, jabaki ardhsainik balon ke javaanon ko aisa kuch nahin miltaa
 The result of this is that there is a difference of eight to ten thousand rupees in the salary of an army soldier and paramilitary personnel
 inaki ye bhi shikaayat he sarhad se lekar aatankwaadiyon se ladate hue jab ye marate hai to shahid kaa darja tak naseeb nahin hota he
 Together, the family receives almost half the financial assistance compared to the army
 2004 ke baad to pension tak nahin milti he
 They demand that they too get One Rack One Pension and get almost all the facilities that army soldiers get
 iske liye inlogon ne sarkaar ko 60 din kaa vakt diya he varanaa phir se andolan kii shuruyaat karenge

 The Delhi BJP now wants Swati Maliwal to be removed from the post of the chairperson of the Delhi Women's Commission

 The letter appealed to LG to immediately seek resignation from the chairperson of the Delhi Women's Commission, as Maliwal has broken the Women's Commission Rules Act and has been doing so continuously
 bijepi netaaon ne apane patr main alji najeeb jang se shikaayat kii he ki dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh jaise jimmedaar pad par rahete hue bhi swati maliwal ne ek balaatkaar peedit kaa naam saarvajanik kiya, jo na sirf galat he, balki aparaadh kii shrenee main aata he

 unke yah kehane ke baad court se jald sunwaayee kaa aagrah karte hue salve ne kaha tha ki samasya gambhir he, nahin to ve sheeghra sunwaayee ke liye fariyaad nahin karte
 Salve said that Haryana has enacted legislation that all Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee will be controlled by Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee
 unhone kaha ki esajipisi amritsar ek antarraji nikaay he, jo aitihaasik gurudwara par niyantran rakhata he
 The court was told that Haryana cannot pass the law without the permission of the central government
 kyonki salve ne baar-baar jamini sthiti ke gambhir hone kaa zikr kiya to pradhan nyaayadhish lodha ne kaha, 'chaahe kuch bhi ho unhen (rajya sarkaar) kanoon evam vyavastha ko bigadane nahin dena he

 Critics also gave attention to new types of love triangles and dialogues in the story
 isamen kaam karne vaale kalakaaron abhishek bachchan, taapasi pannu or vicky kaushal ke kaam kii prashansa hui
 Vicky's look was also discussed
 ye film abhishek kii bollywood kambek bhi he
 After two years, he returned to the big screen from Manmargiyaan
 2016 main unki aakiri film "housephul 3" ai thi
 There were a lot of controversies over some scenes of Manmargiyaan
 sikh sanghathanon ne cigarette pine vaale seen par aapatti jataai or dharmik bhaawanaaon ko aahat karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Later the producers also removed three different scenes from the film
 kya he film kii kahani?film kii kahani amritsar (punjab) kii he, jahaan vicky (vicky kaushal) or rumi (taapasi pannu) ke bich gaharaa ishk he
 Vicky always comes to meet Rumi by jumping from the balcony of the house and the whole locality knows about this
 jab isaki jaankaree rumi ke gharavaalon ko hoti he to ve shart rakhte hai ki vicky ko rumi se shaadi kerani he to use ghar aakar haath maangana padegaa
 The twist in the story comes when Rumi's marriage is decided to NRI Robbie (abhishek Bachchan), Vicky is shocked when he realizes this
 kahani main kai mode aate hai or aakhirkaar bahut sari sichuation se guzarate hue, ise anjaam miltaa he
 Do not be shocked at Nirav Modi's impunity that he refused to return the money to PNB in a blunt tone
 yaa unke vakil ne 2ji or seedbluji kaa udahaaran dete hue ek tarah se yah kah diya ki jaanch agenciyaan neerav kaa kuch nahin kar paaengin
 Where has it come from? It is so courageous that the record of India's investigating agencies is very bad
 is himmayat kii ek vajah or bhi he
 The preparation and efficiency with which Nirav Modi carried out the loot of Rs 11000 crore in PNB is proof that he was supposed to be all this (raid-dispute-interpol)
 anivaasee bhartiya darja le chukaa neerav apane mamaa mehul chokasee ke saath behad aasaani se desh se baahar nikal gaya
 Not surprisingly, soon we come to know that he had citizenship of another country
 kyon he yah ab tak sabase haroonges bank ghotalapienbi ghotaale ke donon pramukh aaropee neerav or mehul ne 2017 ke dauraan james or jewelri kaarobaar ke liye bank ke paas uplabdh short turm inter bank credit (byrs credit-aloyu) kaa bharpoor istekamaal kiya
 This facility is available to importers and especially to gems and jewelery companies for easy operations at international level
 ise padhein: china ke us bank main shaamil kyon he bharat jo karata OBOR kii funding?sibiai kii chargeshit ke mutabaki pienbi kii mumbai sthit ek hi shakha se 69 dinon ke andar (9 farvari se 2 may 2017) ke bich 5,000 karod rupee kaa credit neerav or mehul kii companiyon ko jari kiya gaya
 According to bank rules, it is completely unnatural to give such a large credit in foreign currency to a company during this period
 ek din main ek hi desh kii ek hi bank branch ke liye kai aloyu jari kiye gaye
 It was a well thought out strategy for maximum withdrawals in a short time
 Nirav and Mehul chose foreign branches of public sector banks of India as private or foreign banks might not allow this to happen
 kyon nahin ho saktaa 2017 se pehle kaa ye ghotaalaa?rigerv bank of india ke niyam ke mutabik yadi kisi bank ko antim taarikh se 60 se 90 dinon tak karj par diya paisa waapas nahin miltaa he to us karj ko bank ke enpie yani ki fanse hue karj main shaamil karnaa anivaary ho jayega
 Nirav Mehul chose buyers' credit of banks which are not counted in npas
 neerav or mehul kii companiyon ne pienbi credit par paisa liya jise 90 se 180 dinon ke andar lautaanaa tha
 Some of the buyers' credits received were for a year i
e
 360 days
 donon kii companiyon ko march, april or may 2017 ke dauraan kul 293 letters of anderteking, letters of credit jari kiye
 This is why the defaults of these companies first surfaced in January 2018
 ise padhein: bank main 'jugad' se PNB ko 11,300 karod rupee kaa chuunaa laga gaya neerav modiyadi pienbi se neerav or mehul ko mili bair credit ko 2017 ke pehle kaa maane to phir is udhaar ko pienbi ke enpie arthath fanse hue karj main shaamil karan hoga
 If so, then this scandal will be very heavy on the credibility of India's banking regulation
 PNB kaa paisa tex hewan pahunchane kaa khatra?sibiai ko neerav or mehul kii companiyon par chhapemari ke dauraan na to companiyon ke khate main koi badi rakam mili he or na hi koi aisa dastavej baraamad hua he jisase itani badi rakam ke thikaane kaa pataa lagaaya ja sake
 But the cbi's FIR states that several major withdrawals through lous have taken place in countries that have no direct connection to the diamond business
 mumkin he neerav or mehul ne yah paisa tex haven deshon main pahunchaaya ho jisaki vaapasi naammumkin he
 Why not suspect? Nirav and Mehul's companies (firestar and Gitanjali) have a debt of Rs 8000 crore
 gitanjali kaa purana ricard bhi daagi he lekin iske baad aloyu ke badale paisa dene vaale kisi bank ko yah achraj nahin hua ki in do companiyon ko itane kam samay main itnaa adhik byrs credit kyon mil rahaa he
 There have been two firs in this scam and so far only lous worth Rs 5000 crores have been revealed
 pienbi ise 11000 crores rupee or iskar vibhaag ise 2 xxrep 4 0 karod rupee (is se vittai mantralay sahamat nahin he) kaa ghotaalaa bataa chukaa he
 If this scam is due to buyers' credit or short-term foreign currency loan, then this lou should also be in 2017 itself
 yani ki neerav or mehul ne bharat ke bainkon ko behad safai ke saath heere kii tarah kaat daalaa

 jis tarah se maahaul he mujhe mere bacchon kii chintaa hoti he
 Sometimes the crowd surrounded them and asked whether you are a Hindu or a Muslim
 wo iskaa jawaab nahin de paaenge
 
 
 Because we (wife Ratna Shah) have not given religious education to our children
 
 
 unase unka dharman poocha jayega to ve kya bataaenge
 
 
 The death of a cow is more important than the death of a police officer in the country
 
 
 " (nasiruddin ke puure bayaan ko neeche video main sun sakate hai

 Many leaders have termed Shah's statement as anti-national
 kuch unke bayaan ko pakistan parasti se jodakar bhi dekha
 Let me tell you that violence erupted in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh on December 3 after alleged cow slaughter
 is dauraan kisi ne inspector subodh singh ko goli maar di, jisase unki maut ho gai
 Due to this, Shah released the video on Thursday and gave the statement

 But he could not launch the festival due to strong opposition
 kaaphi der tak litarechar festival ke baahar vah apni gaadi main baithe rahe or phir waapas hotel aa gaye

 An era of Hindustani classical music came to an end today, but Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, the pioneer of this era and 'bharat Ratna', raised the notes to such a height that these voices would float in the air for many years to come
 pandit bhimsen joshi un mahaan kalakaaron main se the jo apni suramayi aawaaj se harsh or vishaad donon hi bhaavon main jaan daal kar shrotaaon ke dil main gahare tak bas chuke the
 His powerful voice was undeniably instrumental in making Joshi the most popular Hindustani classical singer in the present day
 joshi kiraanaa gharaane kaa pratinidhitiv karte the lekin unhone halke shastreey sangeet, bhakthi sangeet or anya vividhtapurna sangeet main bhi apni amit chhap chodi
 The confluence of tact and passion gave Joshi a place apart from other classical singers who remained attached to their gharana culture which could hamper their creativity
 chaar farvari 1922 ko karnataka ke dharwar jile ke gadag main janme joshi ko bachapan se hi sangeet se lagaav tha
 He left home at the age of 11 to search for a teacher for the purpose of learning music
 jab vah ghar par the to khilne kii umr main vah apane dada kaa tanpura bajaane lage the
 His craze for music was that he used to run out of the house only after hearing the sound of 'ajaan' coming from the Bhajan Mandali or the nearby mosque passing through the street

 The BJP currently has 73 mps in UP and the party wants power in the next elections in the state
 aise main bijepi varanasi main vikaas ke dam par apni jagah bananaa chaahati he
 The Pakistani Army has been blown away by the retort of the Indian Army
 ab pakistani sena ne nai chaal chali he or bhartiya sena par cluster bam daagne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 However, the Indian Army has again exposed the lies of the Pakistani Army
 bhartiya sena ne saaf kaha ki cluster bam daagne kaa aarope pakistan kaa ek or safed jhooth he
 Since the Pakistan accusation, questions are arising as to what is a cluster bomb and how deadly it is, due to which Pakistan is in such a panic
 darasal, cluster bam apane aap main kai bamon kaa ek guchha hota he
 It can be fired from fighter aircraft, land and ships
 cluster bam ko behad khatarnaak mana jaataa he
 In the area where this bomb falls, there is tremendous destruction
 is bam kii chapet main aane vaale ilaake main maujuud logon kii maut ho jaati he yaa phir wo gambhir rup se ghayal ho jate hai
 When a cluster bomb is fired and is at an altitude of 1000 m to 100 m above the ground, it covers a very large area
 jaise hi cluster bam fatataa he, to uske andar maujuud bam ek bade ilaake main girane shuru ho jate hai
 Small bombs emitted from cluster bombs cause considerable damage to the area around the target
 is bam se sangharsh vaale ilaake ke aasapaas ke aam nagarikon kii jaan maal ko bhi kaaphi nuksaan hota he
 Not only this, small bombs coming out from inside the cluster bombs stay in the ground for a long time and can explode anytime
 duniya main sabase pehle cluster bam kaa istemaal rus or germany kii sena ne kiya tha
 200 types of cluster bombs have been made so far
 cluster bam ke istemaal par he pratibandhcluster bam ke banane, istemaal karne or ikattha karne par roak lagane ke liye duniya ke deshon ne 30 may 2008 ko ek samjhauta kiya tha
 The settlement was the capital of Ireland, Dublin
 is samjhaute par 3-4 disambar 2008 ko norge kii rajdhani oslo main hastakshar kiye gaye the
 Subsequently, on August 1, 2010, the Convention on Cluster Munitions came into force
 isamen bharat or pakistan samet 120 deshon ne hastakshar kiye hai
 However countries such as the US, China and Russia have excluded themselves from this agreement
 bhartiya sena kaa pakistani sena ko javababhartiya sena ne cluster bam daagne ke pakistani sena ke aarope ko sire se khaarij kiya he
 The Indian Army said that the Pakistani Army constantly tries to infiltrate the terrorists and for this firing on the border
 pakistan ke saath diarectoret of military oparations str kii vaartaon main bharat kai baar kah chukaa he ki vah seemaa paar kisi bhi golibari kaa munhtod jawaab dene kaa adhikaar rakhata he
 Pakistan's charge of firing cluster bombs is another white lie
 kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh (rajnath Singh) ne pioke ke balakot main bhartiya vayusena (indian Air Force) kii karrwai main maare gaye aatankiyon ko lekar bada bayaan diya he
 He said on Tuesday that the number of terrorists killed in the Indian Air Force attack on the training base of jaish-e-mohammed in Balakot, Pakistan, will be known today or tomorrow
 unhone (rajnath Singh) daawa kiya ki rashtriya praudyogiki shodh sanghathan (antiaro) pranali ne bataaya he ki bharat ke hawaii (indian Air Force) hamale se pehle sthal par kareeb 300 mobile phone sakriy the
 Accusing the opposition of doing politics over the airstrikes, the Home Minister said that if the Congress wants to know how many terrorists have been killed, it can go to Pakistan and count the dead bodies
 biguef kii ek seemaa pariyojna kaa udghaatan karne ke baad janata ko sambodhit karte hue singh ne kaha ki anya raajnneetik dalon ke kuch netaa puch rahe hai ki bhartiya vaayu sena ke hamale main kitne aatankwaadi maare gaye hai
 Everyone will know this today or tomorrow
 pakistan or uske netaaon ke dil jaanate hai ki kitne aatankwaadi maare gaye hai
 Taking a dig at the opposition for questioning the number of terrorists killed, he said that the parties are asking how many died, how many died? NTRO has a certified system which states that 300 mobile phones (at the Balakot site) were active
 gujarat ke ahmedabad main 'lakshya jito' program ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha tha ki pichley paanch saal main do badi aatanki strike kaa zikr kiya
 There have been two major incidents in Uri and Pulwama in the last five years
 uri hamale ke baad hamaari sena ne pakistan main ghuskar sargical strike kii or hamaare javaanon kii shahadat kaa badla liya
 After the Pulwama attack, everyone was thinking that there could be no surgical strike this time
 ab kya hoga? us vakt piem modi ke netritv vaali centre sarkaar ne hamale ke baad 13wein din air strike kii or 250 aatankiyon ko maar giraaya
 Shah also targeted opposition parties on Sunday for 'doubting' the courage of the Armed Forces in Surat and demanding proof of an Indian Air Force air strike and said that such statements brought a 'crackdown' on Pakistan's face
 shah ne kaha tha ki agar ye partiyaan pradhanmantri narendra modi or desh ke sashastr balon dwaara pakistan ke balakot main jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki thikaanon par hawaii hamale ke jariye hasil kii gai uplabdhi kii prashansa nahin kar saktin to unhen ‘chup rahanaa' chahie
 Appreciating the Prime Minister's leadership, Shah had claimed that Modi continued his regular work and during this time he also chalked out a plan to punish the culprits of the Pulwama attack on 14 February
 is hamale main siarpief ke 40 karmiyon kii maut ho gai thi
 He claimed that Modi had ordered surgical strikes and airstrikes to explain to the nation what it means to not 'tolerate' terror at all
 shah ne kaha tha ki vipakshi netaa yah nahin jaanate hai ki kya hua
 Mamta Di has asked for proof
 rahul baba kah rahe hai ki iskaa raajnneetikaran kiya ja rahaa he
 Akhilesh has demanded an inquiry
 shame aani chahie ki aapke bayaan pakistan ke chehre par muskuraahat laae he
 'the BJP president claimed that,' Pakistan smiled after the opposition leaders' press talks in which the leaders questioned the courage of the armed forces
 ham samaj sakate hai ki aapmen modi ji jaisaa saahas nahin he, lekin agar aap modi ji or sashastr balon dwaara kiye gaye kaary kii prashansa nahin kar sakate to kam se kam chup hi rahiye
