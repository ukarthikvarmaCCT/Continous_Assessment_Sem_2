 Vanshidhar Boudh was the leave of 8 ministers
 CM Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday had taken strict steps and sacked 8 of his ministers and snatched their portfolios from 9 ministers
 iske baad se hi cabinet main vistaar tay tha
 Keeping an eye on the 2017 assembly elections, keeping in mind the 2017 assembly elections, Akhilesh Yadav has reshuffled the cabinet
 mantrimandal main nae chehron ko shaamil karne ke saath-saath mukhyamantri ke kuch bharosemand rajyamantriyon ko bhi tarakkee di gai he
 The pair of Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone is very popular among the fans
 donon ko ofscreen or onscreen saath main kaaphi pasand kiya jaataa he
 Both of their work in the film Padmavat was highly appreciated
 lekin ab khabar he ki kapal 2019 main puure saal kisi bhi project main saath najar nahin aaenge
 Both of them will not be seen together on the big screen for the entire 1 year
 ranvir singh ne khud is baat kaa khulaasa kiya he
 According to DNA news, Ranveer Singh told, 'he will not join hands with Deepika Padukone in any project in the year 2019
 unhone kaha deepika or meri saath main abhi koi bhi film nahin he
 i hope the filmmakers approach both of us for a good project soon
 main deepika ke saath screen share karne ke liye betaab hum
 ‚Äúthe chemistry of both of us is very fantastic
 main unase bahut pyaar karata hum, jo ki screen par najar aata he
 Deepika is now finalizing the script of the film very thoughtfully
 deepika aaj ke daur kii behtareen adaakaaraon main se ek hai
 i think the filmmakers are yet to bring all of Deepika's talent to the screen

 4ever) onjan 4, 2019 at 10:25 pm PST Deepika and Ranveer tied the knot in November 2018
 shaadi ke baad deepika padukon or ranvir singh donon hi waapas apane kaam par jute gaye hai
 Deepika Padukone will be seen in her next film Chhapak, directed by Meghna Gulzar
 ye film acid atake cerviver lakshmi agarwal kii kahani he
 Talking about Ranveer Singh, his film is making a big hit at the Symbox office and the film is very much liked by the audience
 shahar vahi sabase acha hota he jo sabake liye hota he
 Which is claimed everywhere
 mumbai ko logon ne banaaya kyonki mumbai par sabakaa daawa tha
 Has a claim
 mumbai ke footpath kii kahani filmon main or sahitya main ghar ke rup main aati he, ek thikaane ke rup main jahaan se uthakar koi aasmaan main sitara ban jaataa he
 Wall and acid from Shree 420
 na jane kitni filmein hai
 When someone puts iron nails in an empty space outside his shop in the same Mumbai, that nail strikes the soul of Mumbai
 tabhi jab twitor par keel kii tasviir ai to un logon ko sadma laga jo mumbai kii aatma main yakeen rakhte hai
 By the way, these nails have now been removed, but how insensitive the intention behind planting it must have been
 shater giraane ke baad jo jagah bachi hoti he use oot kehete hai, vahaan log baith jate hai
 When tired, you get tired
 echdiefasi bank ke fort road branch ke baahar keelein lagaai gayi, jinhen ab bank ne hataa liya he
 The bank has also expressed regret
 keel pehle se thim magar nae nirmaan ke baad badi kar di gai
 These spikes are terrible, will not be removed from the minds of those who study the space for the poor in the city for a long time
 chubhti rahengi
 Will today's urban India continue to be so anti-poor, it is going on and on
 khud pevament kii zamin ko parking ke liye hathiyaa letaa he, colony ke saarvajanik raaston par lohe kaa get laga detaa he magar ham is had tak pahunchenge ki baithne kii jagah par keel laga denge taaki is tarah koi thakaa mada thodi si jagah paakar baith na jaae
 Not only India, all the major cities of the world remain homeless
 mausam kii maar jhelte hue kisi park main, kisi ped ke neeche, kisi fliover ke neeche apane thikaane bana lete hai
 Many people see them as filth, as encroachment, as a law and order problem
 aap kya karenge, america kaa ek shahar he california, yah shahar tex ke kaaran bahut mahangaa ho gaya he
 So expensive that households become homeless
 car main raat guzaarte hai or apana makaan bechakar duusare shahar kii taraf bhaag rahe hai
 Between July 2016 and July 2017, 1 lakh 38 thousand people left the city of California
 isliye beghar ko dekhakar naak bhun sicodne kii zarurat nahin he, jinke ghar hai ve bhi beghar ho sakate hai
 But how does the society there see its homeless? sietal paciphical uniwarsity ne begharon se kaha ki aap sardi ke 90 dinon ke liye hamaare campus main aakar rahen, vahaan apana camp laga len
 After that Washington University has done the same
 kya aapane bharat main kisi uniwarsity ko aisa karte dekha he ki sardi ke dinon main begharon ke liye apana campus khol de
 Seattle Pacific University gave 65 homeless people a place to camp in their parking lots
 ham hai ki keel laga rahe hai
 It is better that we imagine a city that is liberal about the homeless
 unka khyaal rakhata he
 That is why in the winter, the government makes a night shelter, then everyone likes it
 ab aapane mumbai main echdiefasi shakha ke baahar keelein dekhi lekin kya yah dilli main nahin ho rahaa he
 It is happening in Delhi but from the other side
 aapane gaur kiya hoga ki dilli ke saare fliover ke neeche kaa hissaa gril lagaakar band kiya ja rahaa he
 You will feel that it is justified to beautify the city, then you have no right to be angry at the spike in Mumbai
 par aapako ek baar sochna chahie ki in fliowaron ko gril se band karne se kiskaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 The beauty here will be how long before your eyes, until you see properly, your car or bus will have moved forward
 iraadaa to sundar banane kaa he, magar jo saaf dikhaai detaa he vah yah ki iske neeche sardi ke dinon main garib na baithen, barish se bachane ke liye scooter vaale yahaan na chhipen
 The grill has been installed under the flyover in front of the Seraikale Khan bus stand where the poor people who landed on the bus used to come to Delhi many times, sit and find their second address
 in garibon ke baithne kaa doosraa intazaam ho isse pehle ye gril band kar die gaye hai
 Not only this, a huge spinning wheel made of steel is placed inside it
 gandhi ne jis charakhe ko antim aadmi tak pahunchane ke liye dhundha, sarkarein us charakhe ke sahare antim aadmi ko bedakhal kar rahi hai
 The entire portion of Delhi's flyover is being cordoned off in this way
 pradooshan itnaa he ki sadak ke bich main koi tahalne bhi nahin ja saktaa he magar sajaavat ke naam par visthaapan kaa yah nayaa khel shahar kii khaali jagahon main keel thonkane jaisaa hi he
 Those planning it must have thought of this big idea, but look at it from the point of view of the homeless and the poor
 aksar yah kahana ki ye atikaraman karte hai, fliover ko ganda karte hai, kanoon vyavastha ko kharaab karte hai sahi nahin he
 The logic of removing the poor seems to be so strong
 You think, the logic is that it is necessary to make the city beautiful, then the cars parked on the side of the road within the colony should be seized first
 wo bhi to atikaraman he
 Hundreds of ponds were encroached in the city of Delhi itself
 koi hataa nahin sakaa
 What did not become by encroaching in many places
 unhen hataane ke liye to dashakon mukadmaa chalata he, aisa kya he ki garib ko raaton raat chup chaap ek baar main hi hataa diya jaataa he
 With the money being spent in decorating it, the facilities of life of common people could have been improved
 kya aap jaanate hai ki in fliowaron ko sundar banane ke naam par kitna paisa karch kiya ja rahaa he
 We do not have complete data but the Times of India report dated 16 December 2017 was found
 isamen kaha gaya he ki pashchim dilli ke saansad pravesh verma ne raja garden or mayapuri fliover ke neeche saundaryikaran ke project kaa udghaatan kiya
 Our video is not there but you can guess how much money the MP or government is spending on removing the poor
 times of india ke anusaar dakshin dilli municipal corporation ne raja garden or mayapuri fliover ke neeche ke hisse ko sundar banane ke naam par 78 lakh rupee karch kiye hai
 The underside of Delhi's Rajgarden flyover has also been beautified
 is tarah se ek nagar nigam 12 se 14 fliover bana rahaa he
 This is a lot of money
 hamaare sahyogi raveesh ranjan shukla ne pataa kiya he ki dakshin dilli nagar nigam ne 12 fliover ko sundar banane ke naam par paune aath karod rupee kharch kiye hai
 Governments are hiring people, are not able to pay them salaries, and are spending 8 crores to make flyovers beautiful
 kya ye vilasita nahin he
 In this money only a poor colony could be improved
 agar hamen yah pataa chale ki sari nagarpalikaayen milakar fliover ko sundar banane ke naam par kitna karch kar rahi hai to yah bajet kaaphi bada ho saktaa he
 It is important that we correct our understanding of the city
 kanoon vyavastha thik nahin he to police kii bhartee karen
 Jantar Mantar was destroyed on the same lines
 rajyon kii rajdhaniyon se dharne pradarshan kii jagahon ko dur kar diya gaya
 Displacement is often faced by those who are sometimes seeking arguments in support of the removal of the poor from themselves
 hamaare sahyogi saurav shukla gudgaanv ke new palam vihaar ilaake main gaye
 Saurav is saying that notice was given 24 hours ago and 30 houses were also destroyed overnight
 vahaan charchaa he ki pradhanmantri ko april main dwarka-gudgaanv express ve kaa shilanyas karnaa he isliye in gharon ko dhahaane main itani jaldi dikhaai gai
 The place costs a lot in the city
 sirf garib ke liye nahin, hamaare aapke bacchon ke liye bhi
 This morning, a young man from Chandigarh messaged that he cycled five kilometers to go to the Beant Singh Memorial Library of Sector 42 to prepare for the competition examination
 librari ne sadsyta kii fees 150 se badha kar 300 rupee kar di he
 Many will feel that there is a slight increase but from the point of view of a student, this Rs 300 pricks him
 ek maheene kaa sadsyta shulk 300 or teen maheene kaa sadsyta shulk 900 rupee kar diya gaya he
 Before you start arguing that sitting at home does not make any sense, i want to tell you something about going to the library for fun
 das saal pehle bani yah librari kaaphi thik thaak he
 There is a system of sitting for 250 people in the reading room of the library, but when we found out, we were told that 450 students come here every day
 jab aap yahaan kii tasveeron main dekhenge to paaenge ki chaatr kitni ekaagratha se pard rahe hai
 If there is no chair, then sitting on the ground and studying
 deevaaron ke kone main baithkar padhate hai
 Beant Singh Memorial Library has 450 students, is it a big deal? pehle yahaan teen maheene kii fees 150 rupee thi, yani ek maheene kii fees hui 50 rupee jise ab ek april se badha kar 300 rupee kar diya gaya he
 Rs 50 to Rs 300 per month directly
 ab sarkarein bhi librari par kahaan kharch karti hai, unhen lagata he ki librari main koun aata he, isliye ve jhansa dene kaa project bana rahi hai, jaise fliover ke neeche kii jagah ko gril se gher kar sundar banaao
 There is so much problem in the city, the government dreams of beauty
 haal philhal main aapane kab suna he ki kisi mukhyamantri yaa pradhanmantri ne librari kaa udghaatan kiya ho
 Looking at these pictures, you will not say now that you are not going to read
 punjab kii baat chali he to vahaan se ek or khabar he jiskaa zikr gaayab he
 If you ask what is going on the teachers there, the teachers from many states of the country will raise their hands and say that yes we are also having the same
 hamaara bhi kuch kiijie
 Contract jobs and low salary have taken the test of patience for the people
 ye tasviir aapako kahaan dikhi magar in logon ko apni haalat dikhne lagi he
 All of them are contractual teachers under the Punjab government
 inase kaha ja rahaa he ki agar aap teen saal tak 10,300 rupee vetan lenge to uske baad aapako permanent kiya ja saktaa he
 Our governments have either become hollow from within or their intentions about jobs have changed
 punjab main sarv shiksha abhiyaan ke tahat 15,000 shikshak hai, is vakt inaki selary 35 se 40 hazaar he magar inase kaha ja rahaa he ki aap 10 hazaar 300 rupee prati maah par kaam kar len wo bhi teen saal to naukari pakki ho jaaegi
 After their performance, the government has filed a case against 7000 teachers
 kya aapane kabhi aisa suna he ki 7000 shikshakon ke khilaaf cese kiya gaya ho
 The FIR has the names of 20 teachers and the remaining are unnamed
 jharkhand main 70 se 80 hazaar paara shikshak hai
 All of them get a salary between 8 and 10 thousand
 yahaan shikshak eent ke bhatta main mazaduri kar rahe hai
 The condition of teachers is bad in every state
 bihar, upi har jagah
 We had told a few days ago that a survey is being done in Jharkhand about which school will be merged with which school
 yah ek nai niti he jo har sarkaar main dekhi ja rahi he
 Thousands of schools are merging
 sarkaar tark detii he ki jitne chaatr hone chahie utane se kam hai
 In this context, the government is taking away the responsibility of its education from the public
 sochna chahie ki aabaadi bad rahi he or sarkari skool me chaatro kii sankhya kam ho rahi he
 Social workers say this is all an excuse to close schools
 jharkhand main charchaa he ki is vilay se 30 se 35 hazaar shikshak naukari se baahar ho jaaenge
 a BJP MLA in Gujarat Legislative Assembly asked the question, the answer is interesting
 27 march ke sandesh main yah khabar chhapi he
 The Education Minister has replied in the House that out of 107 government colleges in the state, 91 colleges do not have principals, the posts are vacant
 60 pratishat sahaayak prophessoron ke pad khaali pade hai
 There is no shortage of employment, yet the unemployed are on the road
 gujarat ke shiksha mantri ne yah bhi bataaya ki porbandar ke 8 sarkari skulon sahit 14 skulon main bijli kaa conection nahin hai
 Whereas Gujarat is considered a surplus state in terms of electricity
 6 hazaar se adhik skulon main chaharadivari nahin he
 The restlessness of the people does not end by taking away the protest demonstration from the city
 wo aapke saamne aa hi jate hai
 The comments lakhanu main beepi id yani physical ajukeshan kii degree dharakon ne bhaajapa mukhyalay ke saamne pradarshan kiya he
 Three demonstrations have been held in front of the BJP headquarters
 ye log maang kar rahe hai ki rajya sarkaar ne bhartiyon par jo roak lagaai he wo hataae or naukari de
 They say that more than 32 thousand jobs have been banned in their segment
 23 march 2017 ko samiksha ke naam par roak lagaai gai he jabaki court ne 28 dinon ke bheetar bhartee prakriya shuru karne kaa aadesh diya tha magar abhi tak shuru nahin hui he
 These youngsters even took off their clothes so that their poverty is seen and restlessness is seen
 aap is hujum ko dekhie, aapako pataa chalegaa ki is vakt noujvaan naukari ko lekar kitna satark ho chukaa he
 These youngsters have not performed for the first time today but do not know how many times they have performed
 phir bhi kisi ko fark nahin padataa he
 What will the job do, when many years will pass in the movement itself to get it
 railway ne 90,000 ke kareeb bhartiyon nikaali thi, isamen 10,000 or jod di he jabaki railway ne sansad kii sthai samiti ko bataaya he ki 2 lakh 20,000 naukariyaan hai, phir ek lakh hi kyon, sari bhartee nikal sakati thi
 So far, around 2 crore students have filled the form for 90,000 recruitments
 2 karod jabaki farm bharne main abhi 5 din or baaki hai
 Unemployment is coming to the fore with its figures
 kahaan to saal main 2 karod berojgaaron ko rojgaar dene kaa vaada tha
 2 crore youngsters are filling the form in one examination
 behatar he ham chaatro kii awaz samay se pehle sun len
 Thousands of officials of Grameen Bank are on strike for three days, but there is no murmur
 vaise to in keelon ko ab hataa diya gaya he leki ise lagane ke peeche kaa iraadaa kitna asamvedansheel rahaa hoga
 The place left after the shutter is called oat, people sit there
 thak jate hai to tik jate hai
 Nails were installed outside HDFC Bank's Fort Road branch, which has now been removed by the bank
 bank ne afsos bhi zaahir kiya he
 The nails were already there but were enlarged after new construction
 ye keelein bhayanak hai, bahut dinon tak shahar main garibon ke liye spes ko lekar adhyayan karne waalon ke zahan se nahin hatengi
 Will be prickling
 aaj kaa shahari bharat kya itnaa garib virdohi hota chalaa jayega, daramil hota chalaa ja rahaa he
 We grab the pavement land for parking, put an iron gate on the public roads of the colony, but we will reach to such an extent that we will put a nail on the seating area so that no tired man can sit in a small place 
 bharat hi nahin duniya ke tamaam bade shaharon main beghar rahete hai
 In the face of the weather, they make their hideout in a park, under a tree, under a flyover
 bahut se log inhen gandagi ke rup main dekhte hai, atikaraman ke rup main dekhte hai, kanoon vyavastha kii samasya ke rup main dekhte hai
 What will you do, California is a city in the United States, this city has become very expensive due to tax
 itnaa mahangaa ki ghar vaale beghar ho jate hai
 They spend the night in the car and sell their house and are running towards another city
 july 2016 se july 2017 ke bich 1 lakh 38 hazaar logon ne california shahar chhod diya
 So there is no need to shrink the nose eyebrow by looking at the homeless, those who have houses can also become homeless
 par vahaan kaa samaaj kis tarah se apane begharon ko dekhtaa he
 Seattle Pacific University told the homeless that you should stay on our campus for 90 days of winter, set up your camp there
 uske baad washington uniwarsity ne bhi aisa kiya he
 Have you seen any university in India do this so that it opens its campus for the homeless in winter
 sietal pacific uniwarsity ne apane parking main 65 begharon ko camp lagane ke liye jagah de di thi
 We are putting that nail on
 behatar he ki ham aise shahar kii kalpana karen jo begharon ko lekar udaar ho
 Takes care of them tabhi to sardi ke dinon main sarkaar rain baseraa banaati he to sabko acha lagata he
 Now have you seen the spikes outside the HDFC branch in Mumbai but is it not happening in Delhi
 dilli main bhi ho rahaa he magar duusari taraf se
 You must have noticed that the entire part of the flyover in Delhi is being closed by installing a grill
 aapako lagegaa ki yah shahar ko sundar karne ke liye jaays he tab phir aapako mumbai main keel thonk dene par naaraaz hone kaa koi haq nahin
 But you need to think once that who is suffering from these flyovers by closing the grill
 yahaan kii sundarataa aapaki ankhon ke saamne kitni der tehregi, jab tak aap thik se dekhenge nahin, aapaki car yaa bas aage bad chuki hoga
 The intention is to make it beautiful, but what is clear is that do not sit poor under it during winter, do not hide here with scooters to avoid the rain
 saraayakale khan bas stand ke saamne jo fliover he uske neeche gril laga diya gaya he jahaan bas se utarane vaale garib dilli aakar kai baar thikaana rakhte the, baith kar apana doosraa pataa khoj lete the
 These grills have been closed before other arrangements could be made for these poor people to sit
 yahi nahin iske bheetar steel kaa bana vishalkay charkha rakhaa gaya he
 Governments are evicting the last man with the spinning wheel that Gandhi has found to reach the last man
 puri dilli ke fliover ke neeche ke hisse ko is tarah se gheraa ja rahaa he
 The pollution is so much that no one can go for a walk in the middle of the road, but in the name of decoration, this new game of displacement is like spilling into the empty spaces of the city
 zarur isaki planning karne waalon ko yah bada idia laga hoga magar aap begharon or garibon kii nazar se dekhie
 Often saying that they encroach, mess up flyovers, spoil law and order is not right
 garibon ko hataane kaa tark itnaa hi majboot lagata he aapako, itnaa hi majboot tark lagata he ki shahar ko sundar bananaa zaruri he to pehle colony ke bheetar sadak ke kinare khadi kaaron ko zabt kar lenaa chahie
 That too is an encroachment
 dilli shahar main hi sainkadon talabon kaa atikaraman ho gaya
 Could not delete any
 bahut si jagahon par atikaraman kar kya kya nahin ban gaya
 To remove them, a lawsuit goes on for decades, what is it that the poor are silently removed overnight
 ise sajaane main jo paise kharch ho rahe hai usase aam janon kii zindagi kii suvidhaayen bhi behatar ho sakati thim
 Do you know how much money is being spent in the name of beautifying these flyovers
 hamaare paas puraa data to nahin he magar 16 disambar 2017 kii times of india kii report mili
 It said that West Delhi MP Pravesh Verma inaugurated the project of beautification under Raja Garden and Mayapuri flyover
 hamaara video vahaan kaa to nahin he magar aap andaaza kar sakate hai ki is par garibon ko dur karne par saansad yaa sarkaar kitna paisa karch kar rahi he
 According to the Times of India, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has spent Rs 78 lakh in the name of beautifying Raja Garden and the underside of the Mayapuri flyover
 dilli ke rajagarden fliover ke neeche ke hisse ko bhi sundar banaaya gaya he
 In this way, a municipal corporation is constructing 12 to 14 flyovers
 yah kaaphi paisa he
 Our colleague Ravish Ranjan Shukla has found out that the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has spent a quarter to eight crores in the name of beautifying 12 flyovers
 sarkarein logon ko theke par rakh rahi hai, unhen selary nahin de paa rahi hai or fliover ko sundar banane ke liye 8 karod rupee karch kar rahi hai
 Isn't it luxury? is paise main kisi garib kii basti hi behatar kii ja sakati thi
 If we get to know how much all the municipalities are spending together in the name of making flyovers beautiful, then this budget can be quite large
 zaruri he ki ham shahar ke prati apni samaj ko zaraa thik karen
 If the law and order is not good, then recruit the police
 thik isi tarj par jantar mantar ko khatm kar diya gaya
 Demonstration sites were removed from state capitals
 visthaapan kai baar unhen bhi jhelana padataa he jo kabhi apane se garib ke hataae jane ke samarthan main tark khoj rahe hote hai
 Our colleague Saurav Shukla went to New Palam Vihar area of gurgaon
 saurav bataa rahe hai ki vahaan 24 ghante pehle notice diya gaya or 30 gharon ko raaton raat tod bhi diya gaya
 There is a discussion that the Prime Minister has to lay the foundation stone of dwarka-gurgaon Expressway in April, so these houses were shown so early in the collapse
 shahar main jagah kii bahut keemat hoti he
 Not just for the poor, but also for our children
 aaj subah subah chandigarh se ek noujvaan ne messej kiya ki vah paanch kilometre cycle chalaa kar sector 42 ke beant singh memorial librari main pratiyogita pariksha kii taiyaari karne jaataa he
 The library has increased membership fees from 150 to 300 rupees
 bahuton ko lagegaa ki maamuli vruddhi he magar ek chaatr kii nazar se dekhie to yah 300 rupaya use chubhta he
 The one-month membership fee has been reduced to 300 and the three-month membership fee to Rs 900
 isse pehle ki aap ghar baithe tark dene lagen ki kisi ko padhane se matlab nahin, librari masti karne jate hai to main kuch aapako bataanaa chahta hum
 This library, built ten years ago, is quite fine
 librari ke reeding room main 250 logon ke baithkar padhane kii vyavastha he magar jab hamane pataa kiya to bataaya gaya ki roj 450 chaatr yahaan padhane aate hai
 When you look in the pictures here, you will find that the students are studying with concentration
 kursi nahin he to zamin par baithkar pard rahe hai
 They sit in the corner of the walls and study
 beant singh memorial librari main 450 chaatr aate hai, kya yah kam badi baat he
 Earlier, the fee for three months was Rs 150, that is, the fee for one month was Rs 50, which has now been increased to Rs 300 from April 1
 50 rupee se sidhe 300 rupee prati maah
 Now, where governments also spend on the library, they think who comes to the library, so they are making a project of bluffing, such as to beautify the space under the flyover by surrounding the grill
 shahar main itani samasya he, sarkaar ko sapane main sundarataa kaa khyaal aata he
 When have you recently heard that a Chief Minister or Prime Minister has inaugurated the library? aap in tasveeron ko dekhakar ab ye na kahiega ki padhane vaale nahin hai
 If there is talk of Punjab then there is another news from there which is missing

 Seattle Pacific University gave 65 homeless people a place to camp in their parking lots

 wo bhi to atikaraman he
 Hundreds of ponds were encroached in the city of Delhi itself

 times of india ke anusaar dakshin dilli municipal corporation ne raja garden or mayapuri fliover ke neeche ke hisse ko sundar banane ke naam par 78 lakh rupee karch kiye hai
 The underside of Delhi's Rajgarden flyover has also been beautified

 This is a lot of money

 Isn't it luxury? is paise main kisi garib kii basti hi behatar kii ja sakati thi
 If we get to know how much all the municipalities are spending together in the name of making flyovers beautiful, then this budget can be quite large

 This morning, a young man from Chandigarh messaged that he cycled five kilometers to go to the Beant Singh Memorial Library of Sector 42 to prepare for the competition examination
 librari ne sadsyta kii fees 150 se badha kar 300 rupee kar di he
 Many will feel that there is a slight increase but from the point of view of a student, this Rs 300 pricks him
 ek maheene kaa sadsyta shulk 300 or teen maheene kaa sadsyta shulk 900 rupee kar diya gaya he
 Before you start arguing that sitting at home does not make any sense, i want to tell you something about going to the library for fun
 das saal pehle bani yah librari kaaphi thik thaak he
 There is a system of sitting for 250 people in the reading room of the library, but when we found out, we were told that 450 students come here every day
 jab aap yahaan kii tasveeron main dekhenge to paaenge ki chaatr kitni ekaagratha se pard rahe hai
 If there is no chair, then sitting on the ground and studying
 deevaaron ke kone main baithkar padhate hai
 Beant Singh Memorial Library has 450 students, is it a big deal? pehle yahaan teen maheene kii fees 150 rupee thi, yani ek maheene kii fees hui 50 rupee jise ab ek april se badha kar 300 rupee kar diya gaya he
 Rs 50 to Rs 300 per month directly
 ab sarkarein bhi librari par kahaan kharch karti hai, unhen lagata he ki librari main koun aata he, isliye ve jhansa dene kaa project bana rahi hai, jaise fliover ke neeche kii jagah ko gril se gher kar sundar banaao
 There is so much problem in the city, the government dreams of beauty
 haal philhal main aapane kab suna he ki kisi mukhyamantri yaa pradhanmantri ne librari kaa udghaatan kiya ho
 Looking at these pictures, you will not say now that you are not going to read
 punjab kii baat chali he to vahaan se ek or khabar he jiskaa zikr gaayab he
 If you ask what is going on the teachers there, the teachers from many states of the country will raise their hands and say that yes we are also having the same
 hamaara bhi kuch kiijie
 Contract jobs and low salary have taken the test of patience for the people
 ye tasviir aapako kahaan dikhi magar in logon ko apni haalat dikhne lagi he
 All of them are contractual teachers under the Punjab government
 inase kaha ja rahaa he ki agar aap teen saal tak 10,300 rupee vetan lenge to uske baad aapako permanent kiya ja saktaa he
 Our governments have either become hollow from within or their intentions about jobs have changed
 punjab main sarv shiksha abhiyaan ke tahat 15,000 shikshak hai, is vakt inaki selary 35 se 40 hazaar he magar inase kaha ja rahaa he ki aap 10 hazaar 300 rupee prati maah par kaam kar len wo bhi teen saal to naukari pakki ho jaaegi
 After their performance, the government has filed a case against 7000 teachers
 kya aapane kabhi aisa suna he ki 7000 shikshakon ke khilaaf cese kiya gaya ho
 The FIR has the names of 20 teachers and the remaining are unnamed
 jharkhand main 70 se 80 hazaar paara shikshak hai
 All of them get a salary between 8 and 10 thousand
 yahaan shikshak eent ke bhatta main mazaduri kar rahe hai
 The condition of teachers is bad in every state

 We had told a few days ago that a survey is being done in Jharkhand about which school will be merged with which school
 yah ek nai niti he jo har sarkaar main dekhi ja rahi he
 Thousands of schools are merging
 sarkaar tark detii he ki jitne chaatr hone chahie utane se kam hai
 In this context, the government is taking away the responsibility of its education from the public
 sochna chahie ki aabaadi bad rahi he or sarkari skool me chaatro kii sankhya kam ho rahi he
 Social workers say this is all an excuse to close schools
 jharkhand main charchaa he ki is vilay se 30 se 35 hazaar shikshak naukari se baahar ho jaaenge
 a BJP MLA in Gujarat Legislative Assembly asked the question, the answer is interesting
 27 march ke sandesh main yah khabar chhapi he
 The Education Minister has replied in the House that out of 107 government colleges in the state, 91 colleges do not have principals, the posts are vacant
 60 pratishat sahaayak prophessoron ke pad khaali pade hai
 There is no shortage of employment, yet the unemployed are on the road
 gujarat ke shiksha mantri ne yah bhi bataaya ki porbandar ke 8 sarkari skulon sahit 14 skulon main bijli kaa conection nahin hai
 Whereas Gujarat is considered a surplus state in terms of electricity
 6 hazaar se adhik skulon main chaharadivari nahin he
 The restlessness of the people does not end by taking away the protest demonstration from the city
 wo aapke saamne aa hi jate hai
 The comments lakhanu main beepi id yani physical ajukeshan kii degree dharakon ne bhaajapa mukhyalay ke saamne pradarshan kiya he
 Three demonstrations have been held in front of the BJP headquarters
 ye log maang kar rahe hai ki rajya sarkaar ne bhartiyon par jo roak lagaai he wo hataae or naukari de
 They say that more than 32 thousand jobs have been banned in their segment
 23 march 2017 ko samiksha ke naam par roak lagaai gai he jabaki court ne 28 dinon ke bheetar bhartee prakriya shuru karne kaa aadesh diya tha magar abhi tak shuru nahin hui he
 These youngsters even took off their clothes so that their poverty is seen and restlessness is seen
 aap is hujum ko dekhie, aapako pataa chalegaa ki is vakt noujvaan naukari ko lekar kitna satark ho chukaa he
 These youngsters have not performed for the first time today but do not know how many times they have performed
 phir bhi kisi ko fark nahin padataa he
 What will the job do, when many years will pass in the movement itself to get it
 railway ne 90,000 ke kareeb bhartiyon nikaali thi, isamen 10,000 or jod di he jabaki railway ne sansad kii sthai samiti ko bataaya he ki 2 lakh 20,000 naukariyaan hai, phir ek lakh hi kyon, sari bhartee nikal sakati thi
 So far, around 2 crore students have filled the form for 90,000 recruitments
 2 karod jabaki farm bharne main abhi 5 din or baaki hai

 This morning, a young man from Chandigarh messaged that he cycled five kilometers to go to the Beant Singh Memorial Library of Sector 42 to prepare for the competition examination
 librari ne sadsyta kii fees 150 se badha kar 300 rupee kar di he
 Many will feel that there is a slight increase but from the point of view of a student, this Rs 300 pricks him
 ek maheene kaa sadsyta shulk 300 or teen maheene kaa sadsyta shulk 900 rupee kar diya gaya he
 Before you start arguing that sitting at home does not make any sense, i want to tell you something about going to the library for fun
 das saal pehle bani yah librari kaaphi thik thaak he
 There is a system of sitting for 250 people in the reading room of the library, but when we found out, we were told that 450 students come here every day
 jab aap yahaan kii tasveeron main dekhenge to paaenge ki chaatr kitni ekaagratha se pard rahe hai
 If there is no chair, then sitting on the ground and studying

 Beant Singh Memorial Library has 450 students, is it a big deal? pehle yahaan teen maheene kii fees 150 rupee thi, yani ek maheene kii fees hui 50 rupee jise ab ek april se badha kar 300 rupee kar diya gaya he
 Rs 50 to Rs 300 per month directly

 All of them are contractual teachers under the Punjab government
 inase kaha ja rahaa he ki agar aap teen saal tak 10,300 rupee vetan lenge to uske baad aapako permanent kiya ja saktaa he
 Our governments have either become hollow from within or their intentions about jobs have changed

 gujarat main 182 vidhansabha chunaav ke liye nattejey aa chuke hai
 The BJP has saved seats in the Patidar stronghold
 shuruuaat main pichhadati najar aa rahi bijepi baad main congress se aage nikal gai
 Initially, the trends were such that Nitin Patel, the deputy CM and the strong leader of BJP, was also looking back
 unhone kaaphi baad main badhat banaai
 All the seats in Mehsana district are the stronghold of the Patidars
 yaheen hardik kii majboot pakad he
 The impact of Patidars on 83 seats in Gujarat should be noted that there are 83 such seats in Gujarat where Patidars have direct influence
 pichley chunaav main yahaan 59 siton par bijepi ne kabja kiya tha
 While Congress candidates won 22 seats
 2 siton par anya ne kabja kiya tha
 The BJP fielded 44 candidates in the cabinet
 abtak bijepi kaa garh thi mehsana1984 main bijepi ko puure desh main keval do siten mili thim
 Mehsana also had a seat during that time
 ye ilaaka bijepi kaa garh mana jaataa he
 But due to the presence of Patidar movement and Hardik Patel, this time the fort of BJP seems to be shaking
 chunaav main rahul ke 21 din: saurashtra main jhonki takat, pehle charan ke focus main central gujaratthi baar gujarat jeetne ke liye bijepi ne edi chotii kaa jor laga diya he
 However, due to the displeasure of the Patidars, this time bjp's return to power in the state is being described as very difficult
 aarakshan mudde ko lekar hardik patel ke netritv main patidaaron ne gujarat main bada andolan chalaaya
 The perceived displeasure of the Patidars and Hardik's campaigning in favor of the Congress is making it difficult for the BJP this time
 nateezon main yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki is baar chunaav main hardik patel kii maujuudagi se bijepi ko kitna nuksaan pahunchaa he
 Gujarat elections 2017: Rupani claims before counting, will win 150 seats
 How important Patidars are in Gujarat can be gauged from the fact that 44 Patidar mlas were given a place in the cabinet in the BJP government
 is vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne patidaar bahul siton par adhikansh patidaar netaaon ko hi tikat diya he
 Votes were cast for the assembly in two phases
 lekin is baar patidaar bahul siton par voting main giravat najar ai he
 Star- Three Star Artists- Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra director-ali Abbas Zafarbajat- Around Rs 50 crores
 tuune maari entriyaan
 
 
 But there were no bells in the heart
 kuch aisi hi he most awated film gunde
 It has a love triangle of Junior Hero and Senior Heroine
 lambey samay baad screen par yaari-dosti dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he
 Bollywood has made its original film by not making a remake of South
 yuva sitaron ko ekadam alag andaaj main dikhaane kii disha main kadam he
 But the two and a half hour long film definitely confuses in terms of story and direction
 film se jis tarah ke karishme kii ummid thi, us par sau fisadi khari nahin utarati he
 Story of the film has two friends Bikram and Bala (ranveer and Arjun)
 vakt ke maare hai
 Are destitute majaburi main gaiyr kanoonee dhandhon main lag jate hai
 This is how life goes on and they become great leaders
 cabre dancer nandita (priyanka chopra) aati he or donon ke dilon main ghantiyaan bajaati hai
 Dawn type heroes hover around him
 asipi sathyajith sarkaar (irfan khan) in donon ko pakadaney kii jugat main raat-din ek karne lagate hai
 Then a game of cat and mouse starts and the two run away from the police
 kai tarah ke sach saamne aate hai, or diarector ko lagata he ki vah aapako seat par khadaa kar degaa
 But the story gets off track somewhere
 chijen aasaani se gale nahin utarati hai
 Ranveer Singh does nothing new in Star Appealfilm
 goliyon kii raas lila
 
 
 He has given his best in ram-leela
 gunde main unka kuch vistaar hi najar aata he
 They chirp, laugh and even act
 lekin dil main nahin utarate hai
 This is the third film after Arjun Kapoor's Ishaqzaade and Aurangzeb
 unhen abhi apni pregence par thodi mehnat karne kii jarurat he
 He has given a third consecutive film as Angry Young Man
 ve ummid jagaate hai lekin abhi lanbaa safar tay karnaa baaki he
 Priyanka is seen trying a lot in the film with her carved body and intoxicating looks
 lekin ise unki film nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Irfan Khan is fine as long as he lives
 kamai kii batfilm kii euaspy iske sangeet ko kaha ja saktaa he
 The songs are excellent
 teenon kii tikdi majaa nahin dilaati he
 The film is released on the occasion of Valentine's Day, but the cinema of Valentine's Day is not at all
 beshak sholay jaisi dosti kii ummid kar rahe darshakon ko niraashaa ho sakati he
 But it can be called Ali's good effort
 baaki janata janardan sab jaanati he or yuvaaon ke dil ko chhu jaae to film kii takadir badal sakati he

 Vinod Khanna had been a Member of Parliament from this seat, but after his death, Sunil Jakhar of Congress became an MP from this seat
 lekin bijepi is seat ke liye majboot ummidavaar kii talash main thi, or kuch din pehle bijepi adhyaksh amit shah (amit Shah) ne bollywood actor sani deol se mulaakaat bhi kii thi
 From that time, speculation about his joining the party had intensified
 vaise bijepi se jude sutara bataa rahe hai ki sani deol (sunny Deol) se desh bhar main jor-shor ke saath prachaar bhi karavaaya ja saktaa he
 Hema Malini from Deol Family is already in the fray and she is contesting from Mathura on a BJP ticket

 Right to information is considered to be the greatest right entrusted to empower citizens in the history of Indian democracy
 iskaa makasad sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main paardarshita or javabdehi ko badhaava dena he
 In 2005, the Manmohan Singh government implemented the RTI Act all over the country except Jammu and Kashmir, the intention was that our democracy should work for the people in the true sense
 lekin kya vaaki aisa ho paaya? vartmaan main kya he artiai kanoon kii hakeekat? kitni paardarshita he sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main? jis kanoon ko janata kii sabase shashakt aawaaj bananaa tha, kahin usee aawaaj ko dabaaya to nahin ja rahaa?beete teen maheene main india today network ke RTI cell or research department ke head ke naate soochna ke adhikaar kaa istemaal karte hue lagbhag 100 yachika daakhil kii gayi or bharat sarkaar ke alag-alag mantralayon se vibhinn prakaar kii jaankariyaan lene kii koshish kii gai
 But what came out cannot be called a good experience
 sarkaar kii ore se yaa to sahi jawaab nahin diya jaataa yaa jawaab diya bhi jaataa he to wo aisa hota he jo aam aadmi ke palle hi naa pade
 The interests of the nation are threatened by information! Red tape is also used in answering very common types of information
 naukarshahi ke andaaj main yah kah diya jaataa he ki ye jaankaree artiai ke tarah-tarah ke section ke tahat hone kii vajah se nahin di ja sakati
 Sometimes it is also said in response that giving such information can damage the interests of the nation or it is 'third party information'
 sidhe sidhe is ravaiye kaa matlab yahi nikalataa he ki jo jaankaree maangi gai he wo nahin di jaaegi
 This is the condition of almost every department
 civil aviation ministry kaa ‚Äòclacyphid information‚Äôyahaan kuch udaahranon se sarkari vibhaagon ke ravaiye ko saaf karte hai
 For example, when the Civil Aviation Ministry was asked for a copy of the order in which Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law and Priyanka Gandhi's husband Robert Vadra had withdrawn the privilege of waivering at airports, the answer was that it is secret, That is, a copy of the order cannot be given
 ab yahaan ye sawaal uthta he ki order kii copy se judi aisi koun si sikresi he, jo saarvajanik ho jaaegi to koi pahaad tut jayega
 When the Civil Aviation Ministry was asked to provide a list of persons who are authorized to take their vehicles to Tarmac at various airports under the RTI, the reply was that it is a 'classified information'
 nahin mili gurmeet ram rahim se judi jaankarido sadhviyon se rape kaa doshi gurmeet ram rahim rohtak kii sunaaria jail main ab 20 saal kii sajaa kaat rahaa he
 When asked for a copy of the order regarding the use of the Reserve Lounge at his airport under the RTI, the reply was received from the Civil Aviation Ministry regarding the Deramukhi Gurmeet Ram Rahim, that the information was approved by the RTI, ie the information cannot be given
 yahaan sawaal uthta he ki kya desh ke saamaanya nagarikon ko aisi soochna hasil karne kaa bhi haq nahin he
 It is not that only the Civil Aviation Ministry has such an attitude towards RTI
 jab rail mantralay se poocha gaya ki bullate train ko lekar japan se baat karnaa kab shuru kii gai? ye bhi poocha gaya ki kya bullate train project ‚Äòbharat-japan 2013 samjhaute‚Äô main shaamil tha? rail mantralay kii ore se jo jawaab mila wo hairaan karne vaala tha
 The Railways raised the right to ask for information
in response, it was said that 'you are using pseudo-information to ask the question about the trend and importance of the government's actions and the government is giving you the right to information in this way Is not obliged to give information of
 ‚Äô yani rail mantralay kii ore se jawaab to nahin mila, jaankaree maangane ke haq par hi sawaal or laga diya gaya
 When the Ministry of Railways asked for a copy of the existing agreement of Bullet Train under RTI, the reply was received that this information is outside the purview of RTI, along with it, it was made available, apart from this and the disadvantages of both countries (india-japan) It can also damage relationships
 aise jawaab kaa sidhaa yahi matlab he ki ye nahin bataaya jayega ki bullate train par baat kab shuru hui, samjhaute main he kya-kya? ye ravaiya sarkaar ke un daavon se bilkul ulat he ki sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main puri paardarshita barti jaati he
 Information related to Modi's visits was not received from PMO
 Now let's talk about PMO i
e
 PMO
 piemo se artiai ke tahat poocha gaya ki pradhanmantri ke videsh dauron par unke saath gaye vaise logon kii soochna di jaae jo unke mitra hai yaa parivaar ke sadsy hai
 The answer was that this information is authorized by RTI and it would not be right in the interest of security to make such list public
 piemo se hi artiai ke tahat jab ye jaankaree maangi gai ki pradhanmantri ko kis desh kaa daura karnaa, ye koun tay karata he
 When and on whose behalf was the Prime Minister's decision to visit Pakistan in 2015, he also got the answer that there are security implications and this information does not come under the purview of RTI
 jab piemo se ye poocha gaya ki pradhanmantri ke kin-kin videsh dauron par videsh mantri bhi unke saath gai thim to jawaab mila, isaki jaankaree pradhanmantri karyaalay ke paas nahin he
 The attitude of the Ministry of Home Affairs is no different
 The attitude of the Ministry of Home Affairs is also no different
 grih mantralay se artiai ke tahat jaankaree maangi gai ki yogaguru ramdev ko kis prakaar kii suraksha muhaiyaa karai gai he? is par kitna kharch aata he? grih mantralay se jo jawaab mila wo bhi anya mantralayon ke dharre jaisaa hi dikhaa
 That is, third party information, it has security implications, it does not come under the purview of RTI
 artiai ke jariye hi hamane dilli police kaa rukh kiya
 Information was sought under RTI as to how many posts are vacant at various levels in Delhi Police? How many policemen are engaged in VIP security? Interestingly, every zone and department of Delhi Police is getting its own answers on this
 inhen ekatra kar koi thos jaankaree visheshgy hi nikaal sakate hai, saadhaaran naagarik ke to ye bas kaa he nahin
 No appeal has any special effect Under the RTI Act, if you are not satisfied with the answer, then an appeal can be filed
 ye root aajamaa kar dekha gaya to iskaa bhi koi khaas nateeja nikalataa nahin dikhaai diya
 For example, the Ministry of Home Affairs was asked to name the last five people who were provided security, along with a copy of the file noting of the order of protection
 grih mantralay se jawaab yahi mila kii ye soochna artiai se excempted he
 When an appeal was made against this reply of the Home Ministry, there was a reply from there that you have been given a proper reply
 artiai ke jariye kii gai is puri kavayad kaa arth yahi niklaa ki jahaan bhi sarkaar ko sawaalon se thodaa bhi ghirne kii sambhaavna dikhi yaa ungali uthne kaa khatra dikhaa, vahaan tarah-tarah ke niyam kanoonon kaa hawala dekar jaankaree dene se manaa kar diya gaya
 In such a situation, even if an appeal is made, you will get the information you want, it is less likely
 intensive care unit main he rtiaratiai ke jariye jaankaree hasil karne ke liye pehali baat to aapke paas vakt, dhairya or hausala hona chahie
 If you have good luck, you might get information
 varanaa soochna kaa adhikaar philhal khud hi intensive care unit main bhartee dikhaai detaa he
 In order to enable the RTI to breathe in the open air itself, whatever treatment is necessary through surgery or life saving medicines, it is necessary to provide them immediately

 padon ke naam Star: 5 Director: Nitin Kakkadakalakar: Sharib Hashmi, Inamulhakfilmistan is a film dedicated to films
 yah film nahin filmon ko salaam he
 It tells the passion associated with films, its story is the story of films itself and it is through them that it gives the message of love and friendship
 yah is baat ko siddh karti he ki film bade naamon se badi nahin hoti balki acting or kahani se badi hoti he
 Perhaps the time when Nitin Kakkar made this film, he would not have thought that the film would be liked this much
 yah bharat ke us popular cinema ko salaam he, jise kai film vishleshak or tathakthith buddhijivi varg sire se khaarij kar detaa he

 Star appealshareeb Hashmi and Inamulhaq are no big names
 lekin unhone apni acting ke dam par siddh kar diya he ki acchhee kahani ke saath agar kamaal kii acting ho to koi bhi kaam naammumkin nahin
 Sharib is awesome in Sunny's role
 gajab kii timming he or aftab ke taur parainamulahakabhi dhyaan khinchate hai
 Both keep an eye on the film and both look very funny
 kamaal ke actor
 The film has nothing to lose because it has looted many accolades at film festivals and around the world
 film kaa bajet bhi kam he, aise main yah har maamle main phaayde main rahane vaali he
 The special thing is that it is also a lesson for those film directors who are in the hope of crossing their eyes in the box office due to weak story and big stars
 film har varg ko conect karti he
 Salute to the spirit of popular cinema
 popular cinema se jude jazbe ke liye film ko paanch star
 Wonderful

 dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal ne kaha he ki na narendra modi, na rahul gandhi, koi or hi pradhanmantri banegaa
 Kejriwal's statement came at a time when the aroma of the alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and Congress is intensifying
 haalanki, donon partiyaan isse inkaar kar rahi he
 Earlier, Kejriwal had come to Kolkata to participate in Mamta's mega rally
 chandrababu naidu bhi kejariwal se mili the
 It is believed that Kejriwal wants to convince the people that there will be a non-bjp non-congress government at the Center
 shastri park main raily ko sambodhit karte hue kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli kii janata se modi ji badla le rahe hai
 If the country is to be saved, then the pair of Modi and Amit Shah be defeated
 ye pradhanmantri banane kaa nahin modi or shah ko haraane kaa chunaav he
 Each person should tell electoral mathematics to 100 people
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki fliover kaa nirmaan hi asli raashtra nirmaan he
 Fighting Hindu Muslims, eating money in demonetisation, GST, ceiling, Rafale is not nation building
 dilli main balaatkaar bad rahe hai, chhedchhad bad rahi he, lekin sisitivi lagavane kii fil 3 saal tak atka di

 Earlier, CM Kejriwal and BJP MLA clashed on Twitter for being omitted from the voter list
 kejariwal ne twit karke likhaa tha, aapke chunaav ayog ne hi hamen 4 saal main kaate 24 lakh logon kii list di he
 This time the dirty game of BJP has already opened
 is liye aap itnaa baukhalaaye hue hai
 Now if i give you the list of many people whose names have been forged, will your Election Commission resign? madhya pradesh kii bhopal seat se bhartiya janata party ke tikat par chunaav lard raheen sadhvi pragna singh thakur ne kaha he ki yah chunaav sabit kar degaa ki bhagava aatankwaad nahin hota he
 Sadhvi Pragya alleged that Digvijay Singh, who is the architect of saffron terror, is fighting in this election
 aise main yah chunaav bhagava aatankwaad ko galat sabit kar degaa
 Sadhvi Pragya, who was jailed on charges of Malegaon blast case in a special conversation with TV Today Network's news director Rahul Kanwal, said she was very happy in her spiritual life, but contested to defeat the person who defamed saffron decided to
 sadhvi ne kaha ki congress desh or dharm ke khilaaf kaam karti he
 The symbol of renunciation like saffron has been associated with Congress terror
 sadhvi ne apane khilaaf liye gaye ection ko lekar bhi congress ko nishane par liya
 Sadhvi said, 'UPA government of Congress conspired in 2008 and put me in jail
 bhayanak yatnaaen deen
 There was an attempt to prove saffron terrorism
 itnaa pratadit kiya jo acolpaneey va asahneeya tha
 i suffered torture for nine years'
 apni kahani sunaate hue sadhvi pragna ne is torchar ke liye ek baar phir shahid hemanth karkare ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 Sadhvi Pragya said that during the questioning of Hemant Karkare's team, i was abused profusely
 itani pidaa di gai ki koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa
 a sadhvi and her clothes were abused
 mujhe bina sawaal kiye peeta jaataa tha
 Accusing these tortures, Sadhvi Pragya described Digvijay Singh as the perpetrator of defaming Hindutva and saffron
 sadhvi pragna singh ne kaha, 'wo (digvijay singh) kaise kah sakate hai ki wo hindu hai
 He has said in front of the media that Hindutva is not on my agenda
 yadi wo hindu hote to bhagava ko aatankwaad kaise kah sakate the'
 When Sadhvi Pragya was asked whether Digvijay Singh was a villain number one for her, Sadhvi said, "she is a person
" is prakaar kii vichaardhaara se hamaari ladaai he
 But why does it happen that one who talks about national interest is put in jail '
 lekin jab unase yah sawaal kiya gaya ki jab bhagava aatankwaad shabd aayaa to vakt ke grih sachiv rahe aarake singh ab bijepi ke saath hai to is par unhone jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 At the same time, when he was questioned about saffron terrorism or Islamic terrorism, Sadhvi said that it has to be seen what the traditions have been
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya samskruti aatank vaali nahin rahi he, jabaki islamic aatankwaad ko unhone kaatane or chhaantane kii paramparaon se jodakar jawaab diya
 Sadhvi Pragya, who contested against Bhopal Congress's Digvijay Singh from Bhopal seat, said that i am contesting this election because the attempt to establish such words (saffron terrorism) in the country and to defame saffron fails
 unhone kaha ki is chunaav main ye sabit ho jayega ki bhagava aatankwaad nahin ho saktaa he
 The Modi government has made another attempt to woo the Scheduled Castes and Tribes
 kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne nichali adaalaton main jajon kii niyukti main essi or asti varg ko aarakshan dene kii baat kahi he
 Let me remind you that this year the Modi government overturned the Supreme Court's decision in which some changes were made in the SC ST Atrocity Act
 haal ke vidhansabha chunaavon main yah bhi ek mudda rahaa tha or mana ja rahaa he ki khaastaur se madhya pradesh main bijepi ko isi vajah se savarnon kii naaraazgi jhelni padi thi
 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in an event in Lucknow on Tuesday that an All India Judicial Service can be made for appointment to lower courts in which UPSC conduct examination for appointment of judges at the all India level on the lines of civil service
 isamen essi / asti varg ko aarakshan diya ja saktaa he
 Appointments of judges can be made in the states after the examination
 ravishankar prasad ne times of india se kaha ki agar aarakshan diya jaataa he to isse vanchit tabake ko bhi aise padon par aane kaa mauka milegaa
 Although the Law Minister did not mention the backward classes, it is believed that in view of the Supreme Court's decision to implement the Mandal Commission, this proposed judicial service will also have OBC reservation
 aapako bataa duun ki desh bhar main nichali adaalaton main badi sankhya main khaali pade pad ek badi samasya ke rup main saamne aae hai
 The central government is working with the Supreme Court to fill more than 5400 vacancies
 isi dauraan upiessi yaa phir kisi anya kendriya agency ke jariye rashtriya pariksha kar rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon main jila nyaayadhishon or atirikt seshan jajon kii niyukti kaa prastaav saamne aayaa he
 The same proposal of the Center was changed by the Supreme Court in the form of a petition last year and issued notice to all the states, union territories and the High Court seeking an answer
 mukhya nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi nichali adaalaton main lambit pade kareeb paune teen karod maamalon ke jald niptaare ke liye in padon ko turant bharne kii ichha jataa chuke hai
 Presently, judges are appointed in lower courts through examinations by the State Public Service Commissions and the High Court
 inamen aarakshan kaa sawaal uthta rahaa he kyonki essi, asti or obisi varg kii numaaindgi behad kam he
 Last year, the Central Government wrote a letter to 24 High Courts asking for the figures of representation of these sections in the judiciary
 sirf 11 rajyon kii ore se jawaab aayaa
 Barring Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, no other major state has responded
 in aankadon se pataa chalaa ki kul 3973 jajon main 563 essi, 478 asti or 457 obisi jaj hai
 This is about 38 percent
 jabaki badi adaalaton main in virgon ke jajon ke koi aankade nahin mil sake
 The Modi government has already proposed reservation in appointment of judges
 lok janashakti party ke netaa ramvilas paswan ise lekar kaaphi mukhar rahe hai
 However, the courts were not positive about it
 november 2014 main patna hai court ne bihar sarkaar kii us adhisuchana ko khaarij kar diya tha jisamen nichali adaalaton ke jajon kii niyukti main essi, asti or pichhadon ko aarakshan dene kii baat kahi gai thi
 The Supreme Court has dismissed the petition of a district level judge of Uttarakhand, asking the High Court to direct the SC / ST reservation in appointment of judges
 sarkaar badi adaalaton main niyukti ke liye gathit rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog main bhi essi asti obisi, alpsankhyak yaa mahila ke ek sadsy ke liye aarakshan kii baat kar chuki he
 However, the Supreme Court has rejected the law of this commission

 The Union Cabinet has approved a proposal to provide 10 percent reservation in government jobs to economically weaker people of the upper castes
 yah prastaav maujuuda samay main nirdhaarit 50 fisadi aarakshan ke alaava hoga yani ise saamaanya siton ke bheetar hi diya jayega
 But the government's move has started raising questions
 is prastaav ko samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ke khilaaf mana ja rahaa he
 There are mainly three types of questions being raised on this proposal
 1
 The question of upper caste representation, in fact, the provision of reservation in the Constitution has been made for those castes and classes who are socially backward and who do not have proper representation in prominent places like government jobs, politics, education
 is aadhaar par dekhen to dalit-pichde virgon ke mukaable savarna aarakshan taarkik nahin thahartaa
 The reason for this is that proper representation of the upper castes is seen in all these places
 2
 No Survey of Savarna Community Another second hurdle in the way of Savarna reservation is that no survey has been conducted yet about the socio-economic level or number of Savarnas in the country
 jatigat janagananaaka kaam shuru to hua tha, lekin use bich main hi band kar diya gaya
 So what will be the way and way of giving reservation to the upper castes? How will economic backwardness be determined? There are unanswered questions about this
 3
 Reservation is given on the basis of caste or class, not on economic basis
 The idea behind giving reservation in the constitution is that if those sections are brought into the mainstream of society, then they are victims of social neglect or backwardness
 savarna samudaay is criteria main nahin aata
 The right to give reservation was made to caste or class because people of many castes and classes in the country have been victims of social discrimination and neglect
 in jatiyon ko mukhya dhara main laane ke liye aarakshan diya gaya
 Reservation is not actually a tool to eradicate poverty, but a means to remove social discrimination
 isliye yah samaj main aane vaali baat nahin lag rahi ki samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ke khilaaf jaakar sarkaar aakhir aarthik rup se aarakshan kaise degi

 There is an atmosphere of desperation, hopelessness and devastation in the lives of farmers due to the delay of the monsoon
 hyderabad se 70 kilometre dur madak jile ke gajavel gaanv, jo telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav kaa ilaaka he, vahaan teen kisaanon ne khudakushi kar lee he

 Bihar on how Lalu compared himself to Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King and BR Ambedkar via Twitter after RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav was convicted by a special CBI court in Ranchi in a fodder scam case Deputy Chief Minister of Sushil Kumar Modi has expressed strong objection
 modi ne sawaal poocha he ki aakhir sarkari khajaane se 90 lakh rupye kii avaidh nikasi ke maamle main doshi qaraar lalu prasad kaise khud kii tulana in bade-bade vishwa netaaon se kar sakate hai?modi ne tanj kasate hue kaha ki chaara ghotaale ke ek or maamle main doshi qaraar die jane ke baad lalu ab tak saat baar jail ja chuke hai
 But Mandela dares to compare leaders like Martin Luther King and Ambedkar
 modi ne kaha ki aatmshlagha or avaidh sampatti banane main loklaj ko tyaag dene vaale log kaisaa netritv karenge ?chaara ghotaale ke ek maamle menlalu prasad yadav kosibiai kii vishesh adaalat ne doshi qaraar diya or purv mukhyamantri jagannatha mishra ko bari kar diya
 The manner in which RJD linked this decision to caste, alleges that Jagannath Mishra comes from Brahmin society, hence he has been acquitted while Lalu is from backward caste, so he has been convicted, Sushil Modi also strongly Objection expressed
 susheel modi nekaha ki 950 karod rupye ke chaara ghotaale se jude is maamle main lalu prasad sahit jin 16 logon ko doshi qaraar diya gaya he, unamem se 8 abhiyukt oonchi jatiyon se he, jisamen vidyasagar nishad or jagadish sharma shaamil he

 She calls it a religious war
 isamen vikaas kaa chhaunk he
 There is a spate of nationalism and national security referring to the surgical and air strikes that followed Balakot and Uri
 vipaksh par ab bhi tushtikaran kaa aarope he or vanshavaad ke khilaaf jang chhedane kii aavan he
 He is charged with representing the gang in pieces
 vipaksh ko pakistan parast or us par desh kaa dushman hone kaa aarope bhi chaspa kar diya jaataa he
 In this Hindutva, there is a model of economic growth that tries to take those sections of the society who have stayed away from the BJP till now and continue to work as vote banks of other parties
 ugr hindutv kaa yah swaroop kisi bhi tarah se kshamapraarthi nahin dikhataa
 He does not care for criticisms
 desh ke taane-bane or sampradayik sauhaard ke bigadane ke aarope se beparwaah he
 There is nothing at all concerned with the intolerant image of India being created at the international level
 yah hindutv kaa vah rup he jo modi-shah kii chunavi mashinari se taiyaar us bijepi kii numaaindgi karata dikh rahaa he jo chunaav ladane ke liye choubees ghante saaton din taiyaar dikhti he
 This is a sign of Hindutva pitting Sadhvi Pragya Thakur from Malegaon bomb blasts against Digvijay Singh from Bhopal
 yah aresas kaa faisla he
 Which has the seal of modi-shah
 yah us congress ko kathghare main khadaa karne kii koshish he jo bijepi ke aakraamak hindutv ke aage pehle hi khud ko bebas paa rahi he
 The Hindutva of the Congress is being termed as soft Hindutva, in which it is necessary to make a havan before circling temples in front of TV cameras and before filing nominations
 congress kii bebasii kaa yah bhi namoona he ki sadhvi ke pratidwandvi digvijay singh jab camere ke saamne aate hai to lalaat par tilak laga kar narmada kaa jayakaara karte hai
 On Sadhvi's candidature, the Congress refuses to send her spokespersons to the TV debate
 congress pravaktaa kehete hai ki ye dhruvikaran kii koshish he
 Its allies are definitely aggressive on this decision of BJP through social media
 umr abdulla twit karte hai
 BJP has made a mockery of law and order with its candidate
 ek aisa shaks jis par aatankwaad kaa aarope he or mukadmaa chal rahaa he saath hi swasthya aadhaar par jamaanat par he vah garmi main chunaav ladane ke liye sehatmand he
 Hindutva is ruled
 idhar, in aalochanaon se beparwaah bijepi ne apane prachaar abhiyaan kaa bhi doosraa charan shuru kar diya he
 The slogan of 'kaam hai na, Desh jhukhe na' has also once again been merged with the slogan of the Modi government
 koshish he ki rashtrawaad or vikaas donon mudde saath-saath chalate rahen
 But the question is, is it a compulsion or strategy for the BJP to follow radical Hindutva? What does the Congress have to answer for this new BJP bet? vittamantri arun jetali ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke netritv main pichhlaa dashak 1970 or 1980 ke dashak kii tarah ‚Äòbarabaad‚Äô rahaa kyonki nirnay lene kii prakriya pradhanmantri karyaalay se baahar chali gai thi, jabaki ab aisa nahin he
 Jaitley said that there is no external interference in the functioning of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government
 unhone yahaan india economik kanvension main kaha, ‚Äò‚Äònisandeh rup se pradhanmantri kaa nirnay antim hota he
 No government, no finance minister or any other minister can ever implement a series of changes and reforms without the full support of the Prime Minister

 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äò30 saal ke baad bharat ko ek party kii bahumat sarkaar mili, phir bhi ham ek gathbandhan sarkaar hai or bane rahenge
 Jaitley said that this made the Prime Minister's Office the final decision-maker in the decision-making process, while the last decade saw the weakness at the policy level when the Prime Minister's Office was marginalized, when the decision-making process was outside the government

 real estate par lagane vaale jiesti rate ghataane kaa elaan buudhvaar ko ho saktaa he
 According to the sources, the rate of GST on underconstruction houses is proposed to be reduced from 18 per cent to 5 per cent

 sumit dutt majumdaar, purv chairman, CBEC kaa kahana he ki yah ek mahatvapurn faisla he ki jiesti rate main katautee kaa phayda to milegaa lekin input credit nahin milegaa
 This simply meant that the outstanding input tax could stand as a major cost

 congress ne somvaar ko saaf kiya ki usne somvaar ko 'bharat band' kaa aahvaan nahin kiya he, lekin notebandi ke mudde par puure desh main virodh pradarshan kiye jaaenge
 The party alleged that the government's decision was a political move, being redeemed as a fight against corruption
 party netaa jairam ramesh ne nai dilli main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi 'dhamaakaa' raajnneeti main bharosa rakhte hai or bade noton ko band karne kaa faisla isliye liya gaya kyonki unhen uttar pradesh main kuch 'sambhaavnaaen' dikhaai deen, jahaan agle saal chunaav hone hai
 Ramesh claimed that 1000 and 500 rupee notes were closed to cover the government's failure to fulfill the Prime Minister's big election promise to bring back black money stashed abroad and that Modi wanted to do something 'dramatic'
 unhone centre sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'yah ek raajnneetik kadam he, jise bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ke rup main bechaa ja rahaa he
 Ramesh said that people who deposit money by illegal means are not having trouble, but those people are facing difficulties who do not have black money
 ramesh ne kaha, 'durbhaagya se jin logon par hamale kii jarurat thi, ve bachakar nikal gaye
 According to Ramesh, a section of 'suit-boot' people are still living a life of luxury
 purv kendriya mantri ramesh ne daawa kiya ki bhaajapa yah galat jaankaree failaa rahi he ki congress or anya dalon ne 'bharat band' kaa aahvaan kiya he
 He said that the opposition parties would celebrate 'jan Aakrosh Day' on Monday and would organize protests across the country
 modi sarkaar ko aade haath lete hue ramesh ne kaha ki 9 november se aarthik gatividhiyaan thahar gai hai
 On the question of the opposition's strategy in Parliament, he said that if the Prime Minister participates in the discussion, then there will be discussion
 unhone nae note laane main sarkaar kii taiyaari par bhi sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki anumaan ke mutabik naye noton kii chapai main or arthvyavastha ko patari par laane main 250 din lag sakate hai
 Ramesh also criticized the call of the Prime Minister of the 'cashless' or 'lescash' society, saying that a large number of people in India use cash in daily transactions
 jab ramesh se poocha gaya ki congress kii sahyogi jediu ke netaa nitish kumaar notebandi ke khilaaf pradarshan ke samarthan main kyon nahin hai, to unhone kaha ki jediu netaa sharad yadav iskaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 He claimed that the Pune-based organization behind the idea of demonetisation has also said that the way in which it is being implemented, such a suggestion was not his
 tippaniyan The Congress leader said that his party was not against the motive of the move and would support steps against black money and corruption, but the reality of the situation is different
 unhone kaha ki desh main keval do pratishat log nakdirahit lenden karte hai, desh ko puri tarah cashlas banane main thodaa samay lagegaa
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Party leader Jairam Ramesh told reporters in New Delhi that Prime Minister Narendra Modi believed in 'big bang' politics and the decision to discontinue big notes was taken because he saw some 'possibilities' in Uttar Pradesh, where elections next year Are to be
 ramesh ne daawa kiya ki videshon main jamaa kaledhan ko waapas laane ke pradhanmantri ke bade chunavi vaade ko puraa karne main sarkaar kii naakaami ko dhakne ke liye 1000 or 500 rupee ke noton ko band kiya gaya tha or modi kuch 'naatakeey' karnaa chaahate the
 Taking a dig at the central government, he said, "this is a political move, which is being sold as a fight against corruption
" ' ramesh ne kaha ki avaidh tareekon se dhan jamaa karne vaale logon ko pareshaani nahin ho rahi he, lekin un logon ko kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, jinke paas kalaadhan nahin he
 Ramesh said, 'unfortunately those who needed an attack escaped
 ' ramesh ke mutabik 'suut-boot' vaale logon kaa ek varg ab bhi vilasita kii jindagi ji rahaa he
 Former Union Minister Ramesh claimed that the BJP was spreading false information that the Congress and other parties had called for 'bharat Bandh'
 unhone kaha ki vipakshi dal somvaar ko 'jan aakrosh diwas' manaayenge or deshbhar main virodh pradarshan karenge
 Taking a dig at the Modi government, Ramesh said that economic activities have stopped since November 9
 sansad main vipaksh kii ranneeti ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki agar pradhanmantri charchaa main hissaa lete hai, to charchaa hogi
 He also questioned the government's readiness to bring in new notes and said that according to estimates it may take 250 days for the printing of new notes and to get the economy back on track
 ramesh ne 'cashles' yaa 'lescash' samaaj ke pradhanmantri ke aahvaan kii bhi aalochana karte hue kaha ki bharat main badi sankhya main log dainik lenden main nakadi kaa istemaal karte hai
 When Ramesh was asked why Congress ally JDU leader Nitish Kumar was not in support of the protest against demonetisation, he said that JDU leader Sharad Yadav is supporting it
 unhone daawa kiya ki notebandi ke vichaar ke peeche pune kaa jo sanghathan he, usne bhi kaha he ki jis tareeke se ise lagu kiya ja rahaa he, us tarah kaa suzav unka nahin tha
 The comments congress netaa ne kaha ki unki party is kadam ke makasad ke khilaaf nahin he or kaledhan tathaa bhrashtachar ke khilaaf kadamon kaa samarthan karegi, lekin halaat kii hakeekat alag he
 He said that only two percent people in the country do cashless transactions, it will take some time to make the country completely cashless
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 krishna ne jor dekar kaha ki hedli se kii gai poochtacha main pakistan galati nahin nikaal saktaa kyonki yah jaanch kaary america jaanch agency epabiai ne bhi kiya he

" Hope to meet you
 ‚Äô‚Äô unhone apni yatra ko ek ahm yatra bataate hue ummid jataai ki yah donon deshon ke bich ek shantipurna, dostana or sahyogi rishta banane ke prati hamaari koshishon ko ‚Äòek naye safar‚Äô par le jaaegi
