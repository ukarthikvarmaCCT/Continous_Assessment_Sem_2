 Varna Kohinoor is not stolen, this truth is nothing short of a shock
 kohinoor ko lekar tamaam jhooth or myth kii chamak feeki kar di thi sarkaar ke vakil ne
 As long as this appeal is pending in the Supreme Court, our star man artists can continue the practice of diamond theft in the film scene
 balki ve chahen to thode samay ke liye ab plat badal len
 They should not steal the diamond
 tohfe main diya karen taaki kohinoor hamaari rashtriya granthi yani complex se azaad ho sake
 It seems that we can also give a diamond as a gift
 wo hira jo hira he sadaa ke liye
 For Queen Victoria
 hira kii tamanna he ki panna mujhe mil jaae
 Whether i know my life or my heart
 yahi gaaiye taaki kuch to raahat pahunche
 That is why our heroes have been taking the risk of bringing diamonds in all the films
 kabhi bhi ve film ke shuru main hira nahin churaate hai
 He practices in the entire film and then steals it in the last scene
 hira or clamex kaa janm-janm kaa naata he
 In Dhoom-2, Hrithik Roshan became the idol of Plaster of Paris
 unke saath heere ke sef main khadaa ho gaya
 i think that the set of diamond theft that happens nowadays is a lift area in a big building where many doors keep opening and closing simultaneously
 usee ko dhokhe se film vaale dikhaate hai ki dekho kitni suraksha he heere kii
 How many doors are there prince main to vivek obray pataa nahin koun sa kapadaa pahentaa he jo 440 volt ke karant ko jhel jaataa he
 In the eyes, how much training does Sushmita Sen give to Paresh Rawal, Arjun Rampal and Akshay Kumar
 paresh rawal to bijepi ke saansad bhi hai
 They should come forward and say that i have stolen diamonds in a film
 wo bhi ankhen band kar ke, sarkaar ajna de to wo kohinoor laa sakate hai
 In Happy New Year, Shah Rukh Khan divides the people of the world into two parts
 kehete hai duniya main do tarah ke log hote hai
 One winner and one loser
 ye amir or garib ke sanathan bantwaare ke market main nayaa item tha jisane puure vimarsh ko hi badal diya
 But not all people go to London to steal a diamond
 mere khyaal se pehle dubai main practice karnaa chaahate honge ki yahaan se ham chura sakate hai yaa nahin
 Later we will think Kohinoor
 king khan kehete hai ki zindagi har luzar ko ek mauqaa detii he taaki wo vinar ban sake
 i swear this dialogue with him, i was first convinced and then injured
 kohinoor aayega
 Life will give us a chance to bring it
 is ummid ke saath main cinema ghar se apane ghar laut aayaa
 In the name of Aurangzeb, we cannot tolerate the road but can be so desperate for Kohinoor touched by Babur's hand, did not understand
 yahi kya kam he moorkhon ne abhi rashtrawaad ke naam par un logon ko deshadrohi nahin ghoshit kiya he jinhone ankhon kaa nur kohinoor angrezon ko tohafe main de diya
 Kohinoor is the name of the occasion for us Hindus to become winners from losers
 ise laane ke naam par gaanv-gaanv gali-gali itihaas ke koodaakaar ajab-gajab ke kutark failaate rahete hai
 As soon as it was learned that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was going to London in November 2015, Hindi channels created a ruckus about the Kohinoor diamond
 kohinoor ko lekar lok swapn rachaa gaya ki yahi he wo hira
 Look closely, tear your eyes and see
 modi ji lekar aane vaale hai
 The channels did a trick
 jab bhi likhaa, prashnvachak chinh ke saath hi likhaa ki modi queen se kohinoor kii maang kar sakate hai? kya modi queen ke saath lunch ke dauraan kohinoor heere kii maang kargen ? you tub par maujuud in channelon kii cliping se pataa chalata he ki acha khaasaa propeganda khadaa kiya gaya
 His words made it seem as if PM Modi was going to say during lunch that Madam, the diamond which is placed next to you, if found
 
 
 main nahin, hamaare mulk ke channel vaale maang rahe hai
 
 
 if
 
 
 nahin to koi baat nahin
 
 
 
 
 There was a lot of news based on 'aisa Pyaar Hai'
 kisase pataa chalaa he kisi ne nahin bataaya
 It is revealed as if the jungle-jungle thing has gone
 mujhe to aisa hi sound karata he
 Meanwhile, Azam Khan from Uttar Pradesh started to make a statement that Prime Minister should bring Kohinoor as well as bring the ring of Tipu Sultan from London on which Ram is written
 kuch to khyaal rakhaa hota aazam sahab states kaa bhi
 The jeweler did not go to the shop to ask for a ring with diamonds from our PM
 heere kii maang hui yaa nahin, kisi ko pataa nahin
 The comments bhartiya rashtrawaad ke kuch rikt sthaan hai jise hamaari raajnneeti is ummid main kunthit karti rahati he ki kabhi hameen bharenge
 Our nationalism will not be complete until we fill it
 sansad se lekar sadak par kohinoor bhi us rikt sthaan kii tarah pesh kiya jaataa rahaa he jise landan se laakar bharaa janaa tha
 But hi
 sarkaar ne ye kya kar diya
 If someone had not been robbed, he would have said that he had stolen it
 ye bhi bolne kii koi baat thi ki hamane tohfe main diya he
 The Modi government abolished all the excitement regarding Kohinoor
 modi ji jab landan yatra par the tab britain ke pradhanmantri ne enditivi se kaha ki ham kohinoor nahin denge
 In this way only our museum will be empty
 saim tu saim baat bharat ke solicytor general ranjit kumaar ne supreme court main kahi he ki aisa karenge to hamaare musium khaali ho jaaenge
 Go o world people, we sacrificed the dream of the country for the sake of the museum
 lekin supreme court ko abhi bhi last hope he isliye court ne cese ko kaarij nahin kiya taaki bhavishya main koi daawa kare to mushkil na pesh aae ki aapaki court ne ise riject kiya hua he
 That is, the Supreme Court has kept that dream alive
 varna kohinoor chori nahin hua he, yah satya kisi sadame se kam nahin he
 All the lies and myths about Kohinoor had shone brightly
 jab tak ye apil supreme court main lambit he tab tak hamaare star yaar kalakaar filmi seen main hira chori kaa abhyaas jari rakh sakate hai
 If they wish, then change the plot for a short time
 ve hira chori na karen
 Give it as a gift so that the Kohinoor can be freed from our national gland ie complex
 lage ki tohfe main ham hira bhi de sakate hai
 a diamond that is a diamond forever
 maharani victoria ke liye
 Heera wishes that i can get the page
 chaahe meri jaan jaae, chaahe meraa dil jaae
 Sing this so that some relief will come
 happy new year main shahrukh khan duniya ke logon ko do bhaagon main baant dete hai
 It is said that there are two types of people in the world
 ek vinar or ek luzar
 It was a new item in the ever-dividing market of the rich and the poor, which changed the whole discourse
 magar hira chori karne saare log landan nahin jate hai
 i would like to practice in Dubai before i think whether or not we can steal from here
 baad main ham kohinoor sochenge
 King Khan says that life gives every loser an opportunity to become a winner
 kasam se unke is samvaad ne mujhe pehle qaayal kiya phir ghayal kar diya tha
 Kohinoor will come
 zindagi hamen ek mauka degi use laane kaa
 With this hope, i returned home from the cinema
 aurangzeb ke naam se ham road tak bardaasht nahin kar sakate lekin babar ke haath se sparsh hue kohinoor ke liye itane betaab ho sakate hai, samaj nahin aayaa
 What is less, the fools have not yet declared those people as traitors in the name of nationalism, who gave the eyes of Noor Kohinoor to the British as a gift
 kohinoor ham hindustaniyon ko luzar se vinar banane ke mauqe kaa naam he
 In the name of bringing it, village-by-street, the garbage of history continues to spread the wonders of wonder
 jaise hi pataa chalaa ki november 2015 main pradhanmantri narendra modi landan jane vaale hai hindi channelon ne kohinoor heere ko lekar hangaamaa khadaa kar diya
 Public dream was created about Kohinoor that this is the diamond
 gaur se dekho, ankhen fadkar dekho
 Modi ji is about to come
 channelon ne ek chaalaaki kii
 Whenever written, with the questioning symbol written, Modi can ask the Queen for Kohinoor? Will Modi demand Kohinoor diamond during lunch with Queen? Clipping of these channels on youtube shows that a significant propaganda has been created
 unki baton se aisa laga jaise piem modi lunch ke dauraan yah kehane vaale hon ki madam wo jo hira rakhaa he aapke bagal main, agar mil jaataa to
 
 
 Not me, our country channels are asking
 
 
 agar
 
 
 No problem otherwise
 
 
 
 
 ‘aisa pataa chalaa he’ ke aadhaar par koob khabaren chali
 No one has revealed to whom it is revealed
 aisa pataa chalaa he jaise jangal-jangal baat chali he pataa chalaa he
 It makes me sound like this
 udhar se uttar pradesh se aazam khan bayaan dene lage ki pradhanmantri kohinoor to laayen hi saath main landan se tipu sultan kii wo anguthi bhi lete aaen jis par ram likhaa he
 Something would have taken care of the status of Azam Saheb too
 johari kii dukaan main nahin gaye the hamaare piem ki heere ke saath ek anguthi bhi maang lete
 No one knows if there was a demand for diamonds
 tippaniyan There are some blanks of Indian nationalism which our politics keeps frustrating in the hope that we will be filled sometime
 jab tak nahin bharenge hamaara rashtrawaad puraa nahin hoga
 From the Parliament to the road, Kohinoor has also been presented as a vacant place to be filled from London
 magar hai
 What did the government do? koi lut kar nahin le gaya to yahi kah dete ki chori kar le gaya tha
 It was also a matter of saying that we have given gifts
 kohinoor ko lekar sara excitement hi khatm kar diya modi sarkaar ne
 When Modi was on a visit to London, the British Prime Minister told NDTV that we will not give Kohinoor
 aise to hamaare musium hi khaali ho jaaenge
 Talk to the same thing, Solicitor General of India Ranjit Kumar has said in the Supreme Court that if we do this then our museum will be empty
 jaao o duniya waalon, hamane musium kii khaatir mulk kaa sapana qurbaan kar diya
 But the Supreme Court still has the last hope, so the court did not dismiss the case so that if someone makes a claim in future, it will not be difficult that your court has rejected it
 yani supreme court ne us sapane ko zindaa rakhaa he
 Varna Kohinoor is not stolen, this truth is nothing short of a shock

 '' Attacking him due to allegations by Congress Chief Minister Narendra Modi about Congress President Sonia Gandhi's expenditure on foreign tours, Congress leader Digvijay Singh has said that the RSS has trained him 'well' in the 'nazi tradition' of propaganda
 congress netaa ne yah bhi kaha ki swasthya se jude mudde kaa raajnneetikaran karne se bhaajapa kii ‘sasti manshaa’ sabit ho gayi he
 Comparing the Chief Minister of Gujarat with the propaganda minister of Germany's Nazi government, Joseph Goebbels, Singh again attacked his favorite target RSS and alleged that he trained his cadres in a propaganda campaign
 twitor par apane taaja post mensinhane kaha, ‘sangh apane kaaryaktaaon ko dushprachaar main prashikshit karata he
 Naturally Kimodi has received good training
 sangh ne apane ko naaji parampara main dhaala he

 He made this charge by quoting a news report in the media
 modine somvaar raat ko kaha tha ki yadi unka daawa galat niklaa to vah saarvajanik rup se apni galati sweekaar kar lenge
 Addressing a rally in Junagadh, Modi said, 'I have said this based on the news published in a newspaper

 'congress President Sonia has gone to an undisclosed location abroad for surgery more than three times in the last one year
 modine kaha ki haryana main hisar ke ek yuvak kii artiai arji par sarkaar dwaara diye gayi jawaab par aadhaarit 12 july ko chhapi samachaarpatr kii khabar unke daawey kaa aadhaar he

 ’ unhone yah kahkar 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke bare main sanket kiya
 Singh said, 'I don't expect forgiveness
 ’ Noting the criticism leveled by some leaders of the RJD, an ally of the ruling Grand Alliance in Bihar, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday said he does not care what the 'others' are saying

 After reaching Siwan, Shahabuddin said that Nitish is not the leader of the people, he has become the Chief Minister because of the alliance, like Madhu Koda was made
 isse pehle shanivaar ko jail se chhootane par shahabuddin ne nitish kumaar ke bare main kaha tha ki vah 'paristhitivash mukhyamantri' hai

 sabhi raajnneetik dal vidhansabha chunaav ke liye taiyaar rahane kii baat kar rahe hai

 Significantly, Manjhi has refused to join any party or coalition that will have Nitish Kumar, while Pappu has also made it clear that there will be no electoral coordination with Nitish and Lalu's alliance
 aise main yah tay he ki vidhansabha chunaav main maanjhi, nitish ke jad (you) ke saamne honge, vahiin pappu rajd ko haraane ke liye koi kor-kasar nahin chhodana chahenge

 Though the Reserve Bank has taken this step in the interest of consumers, it may have an adverse impact on business activities during the upcoming festive season
 kendriya bank ne bainkon se yah bhi kaha he ki debit card se bhugtan karne par koi atirikt shulk nahin liya ja saktaa
 The Reserve Bank notification states, '
 
 In principle, banks should not do any such thing which messes up the interest rate of a product
 isse mulya pranali kii paardarshita dooshit hoti he
 In the purchase of a product, value is important in the decision making by the customer
 ’adhisuchana main kaha gaya he ki shunya byaaj dar kii avadharana astitv main nahin he
 The proper practice is that processing fees and interest rates should be kept the same in different products and categories, irrespective of the source
 credit card ke jariye shunya byaaj dar vaali masik samaan kishton (iemai) vaali yojana main aamtaur par byaaj raashi ko processing fees ke taur par graahak se vasuul liya jaataa he
 The Reserve Bank believes, "similarly, some banks incorporate the cost of the loan into the interest rate
 ’byaaj par riyaayat maamle main kendriya bank ne kaha he ki aisi yojanaon main phayda pahunchane ke liye byaaj kam karne ke bajaay riyayati raashi ko kam karne ke baad karj raashi ko manjuuri di jaani chaiye
 In the interest of the customers, the Reserve Bank has also told the banks that if a period of stay is kept for some time in the repayment of loan, in such cases, instead of adjusting this rebate in interest, care should be taken that interest Including repayment time should be fixed only after the postponed period
 aamtaur par graahakon ko kisi utpaada kii kishton main kharidari par shunya byaaj dar yaa phir nishchit avadhi ke baad hi karj chukaane kii peshkash utpaada vinirmaataaon yaa phir dealer dwaara kii jaati he
 But in this, purchases are made by taking loans from banks
 rigerv bank ne kaha he ki in sabhi maamalon main bainkon ko chaiye ki vah graahakon ko puri tarah se sabhi laabhon ke bare main avgat karaayen or unhen puri yojana kaa har tarah kaa laabh uplabdh karaayen

 Salman Khan's baraat-like scene was not just a king when stars landed on the ground
 shahrukh kii kami bahut khal rahi thi
 Remember that the story of Om Shanti Om, when Shah Rukh Khan showed his strength by collecting every big star, but in front of Salman Khan's courage, all the previous Bollywood films have faded
 biing human ke liye jute sitarezarurmandon kii bhalaai se judi sanstha biing human ke liye salmaan ne sitaron ko aawaaj lagaai to har koi dauda chalaa aayaa
 Aamir Khan, Akshay, Saif Ali Khan, Sanjay Dutt, Ajay Devgan, Govinda seemed no less, but the way the big stars were walking behind Katrina and Salman, it seemed as if Salman's procession was going on
 Doing
 aisa nahin ki sirf dost hi katrina or salmaan ke catwalk ke gavaah bane hon
 Salman and Salma were both Salman's mother in the audience gallery
 darshak ddeergha main salmaan kii bhabhi malayaka aroda bhi thi
 Despite being pregnant, his sister Amrita Arora also came
 maanon puraa khandaan salmaan or cat ko aashirwad dene ke liye maujuud ho
 In the color of Salman, Katrinaashree Devi, Sushmita Sen, Preity Zinta Farah Khan, Amisha Patel, Tivankal Khanna, all of them were enjoying this beautiful view under this roof at that time
 aamir kii patni kiran bhi kahin kisi kone se salmaan or katrina ke is kaitwa ke najaare ko dekh rahi thi
 Salman Khan's fairy i
e
 Katrina Kaif, who is very exquisitely saluting Salman's collection with her beauty
 is pari ne jo goun pahana he us goun ke har rang salmaan ke hai
 a special painting of Salman has been launched in this gown
 salmaan ke rang me rangi katrina yakeenan kisi pariyon kii rani se kam nahin lag rahi thi
 In this show of Salman, only Katrina was a heroine, who spread her magic on the ramp
 baraat main the har bhang ke baaratisalman kii baraat main har rang dhang ke baaraati thi
 Bollywood's Bad Boy, Good Boy, Smart Boy
 charming bvoy sab baaraati ban kar pahunche the
 Seven rounds could not happen, but Salman did make a catwalk with Katrina, and with friends in a short time and his entire family came down the ramp, but Salman's eyes were very sharp on the color of his barayat
 tabhi to wo apane sabase khaas mehmaan ko bollywood ke bedbvoy kaa darja dene se nahin hichakate
 In the Bad Boy image of Sanjay Dutt, Salman's Saloon was added to the moon
 salmaan ke sabase charmin hero hai aamirasalmaan ke liye sabase charming hero the aamir khan or salmaan ne sabase zyada kisi hero ke luks kii tarif kii to wo the akshay kumaar, lekin salmaan kii baraat main koi rockstar jaisaa lag rahaa tha wo the saf ali khan
 If there was fun and a smile on everyone's face in this meeting, then Ajay Devgan looked very serious and what to say about sister-in-law, Arbaaz and Sohail? Salman says both my brothers are very cool
 salmaan kii baraat jaisaa najaara ho or partner najar naa aaye aisa kaise ho saktaa he

 unhone aage kaha, mamata banerjee sarkaar ne unhen markar yah sabit kar diya he ki bhavishya main logon ke shabd antim honge
 The comments darasal, kishanji moawadi andolan ke pramukh cheharaa hone ke saath ek uske mukhya cmanderon main se ek tha
 After the news of Sukotshwar Rao alias Kishenji being killed in Burisol forest in West Midnapore in 2011, there was a dispute that he was killed in custody by paramilitary forces
 kuch dinon baad mukhyamantri banerjee ne kaha tha ki maine suraksha balon se ghatana ke bare main poocha tha ki aapane unhen sarender karne kaa mauka kyon nahin diya, to unki taraf se bataaya gaya ki kishanji ko sarender karne ke liye teen din kaa vakt diya gaya tha, lekin unki taraf se golibari kar di gai

 skool main unke saath padhane vaale bachche unhen 'baaji' kehete hai
 Significantly, in Nepal, the word "baji" is used for 'dadaji'
 unhen saamaajik adhyayan kaaphi pasand he
 Apart from this, he also enjoys playing football and volleyball with the children
 ve kehete hai ki umr ke is padaav par aise khel kar ve atmik tripti kaa anand lete hai
 Deprived due to economic constraints and distance
 
 
 ve kehete hai ki jab ve chote the to ghar kii sthitikhastahalarahati thi

 The police on Monday detained Hardik Patel and his partner Dinesh Bamnia, who emerged in Gujarat politics along with the Patidar agitation demanding reservation
 hardik or uske 6 saathiyon par ravivaar ko hui public meeting ke saath mehsana ke patidaar aarakshan andolan ke kanvinar narendra patel ke saath hotel ke kamare main marpet karne or paise lekar bhaagane kaa aarope he
 The police detained Hardik when he was going for an aarti at a Ganesh pandal in Anand
 hardik ke aanand pahunchane se pehle hi police ne unhen aanand express haive se hi hiraasat main le liya
 Rajkot police, on the other hand, detained Dinesh Bamnia
 donon kii castady patan police ko saunpi jaaegi
 Also, by Tuesday afternoon, Patan police will present both in court and seek remand
 bataa den ki hardik patel ko jis tarah hiraasat main liya gaya he
 Due to this, resentment against the government is increasing among the Patidars
 sarkaar lagaataar patidaaron ko lubhaane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 It is clear from Hardik's anti-government statement and the arrest made just ten hours after the Congress was given an option that the Vijay Rupani government of Gujarat would not bow down to Hardik Patel for the Patidar votebank
 vahiin is puure maamle main police ne aaropee dhiraj paswan ko giraftaar kar liya he or police ke saamne aaropee ne is jaghanya aparaadh ko sweekaar bhi kiya he
 At the moment, this incident is reminiscent of Delhi's painful Nirbhaya incident
 sarvakaamana purti karta va brahmahatya naashak jaya ekadshi kaa bahut mahatv he
 Ekadashi date falls twice every month
 ek krishna paksh kii ekadshi va duusari shukla paksh kii ekadshi
 Both Ekadashis have their own importance and fruit
 is tarah prayek varsh arthath baarah maheene main choubees ekadashiyaan hoti hai or jis varsh adhikmas arthath malmaas aata he tab inaki sankhya badhkar chhbbees ho jaati he
 The practice of observing Ekadashi fast on the dates of these Ekadashi has been maintained in India since ancient times, which has become its own important place in Indian social life
 shivlinga par nahin chadhaani chahie ye chijenkaise pade ekadashiyon ke nambharatiya or vishwa bhar main based pravasi bharatvanshi in ekadshi tithiyon ko bade hi shraddha bhav se ekadshi vrath karte hai
 Different names of the date of these Ekadashis are also prevalent
 maa lakshmi se aise paaen vaibhav kaa vardaanpuranic manyatanusaar bhadrapada ke krishna paksh kii ekadshi ko aja ekadshi athwa kamika ekadshi, magh maas ke krishna paksh kii ekadshi ko shatatila ekadshi va magh maas ke shukla paksh kii ekadshi ko jaya ekadshi kehete hai
 Aaj Ekadashi or Kamika Ekadashi fasting on the Ekadashi of the Krishna Paksha of Sanjeevani Paharbhadrapada is still present here today, eliminating all sins and sufferings and providing all kinds of happiness and prosperity
 aja ekadshi ke vrath ko karne se purvajanm kii baadhaaen dur ho jaati hai
 On this Ekadashi, worship of Lord Vishnu's Upendra form is worshiped and night awakening is done
 is pavitra ekadshi ke fal lok or paralok donon main uttam kahe gaye hai
 Tulsi plant predicts trouble when Jaya Ekadashimagh Ekadashi of Shuklapaksha month is called Jaya Ekadashi
 yah ekadshi sabhi paapon ko harne vaali or uttam kahi gai he
 Being holy, it destroys all the sins of the fasting person and by observing it every year, humans get enjoyment and salvation
 jaane kya narayan ko kehete hai hari
 
 
 Even by performing this Ekadashi, one gets freedom from sins like Brahmachar
 is tithi ko bhagwaan keshav kaa pushp, jal, akshat, roli tathaa sungandhit padaarthon se pujan kiya jaataa he

 The 'kalam Azad Hai Teri' session of 'sahitya Aaj Tak' was attended by noted novelist and writer Sharmila Bohra Jalan
 is dauraan unhone kalam kii aazaadee or lekhnee par khulkar apni raay rakhi
 Jalan, who has written famous books like 'shaadi se Peshtar', 'budha Chand', 'raag-virag and other stories', is a new-age writer who speaks in the form of Kisagoi
 'kalam aaazaad he teri' satr ke dauraan jab unase poocha gaya ki kya ek lekhika kitaab benchne or shoharat hasil karne ke liye hi stri kii baat likhti he, to unhone kaha, ‘aisa nahin he
 Woman is a state of mind
 ecadamibhi stri kii bhaavana ko behatar dhang se likh saktaa he
 i am a writer and a writer is a writer
 ek lekhak ko stri yaa purush kii simaaon main baandhne kii koshish nahin kerani chahie
 'kaljalan is raised in protest that the pen is raised in opposition and resistance of anyone
 lekhan ke dauraan lekhak ko tamaam dwandvon se guzarana padataa he
 During this, while advocating for women's rights, he questioned that if a writer writes boldly, why does society become restless? The finger of the character of such writers is raised
 ise bhi padhie- sahitya ajtakah nilimaa boleen- main sirf ek lekhak, feminist hona ek galisath hi yah kaha jane lagata he ki isamen wo mahilaayein nahin hai, jo gramin kshetra se aati hai
 They are not women who are really suffering
 isamen sharaab pine vaali mahilaon kii baat likhi gai he
 After all, why the society is unable to accept the writings of such women? Whatever it is, but society has to accept it
 'is hindustan main kai hindustan'lekhika jalaan ne kaha ki is ekahindustanmen kai hindustan hai
 There is also a country where there are rural women
 yahaan ek aisa bhi hindustan hai, jahaan mahilaayein genes pahenti hai
 There is a great difference between the old thinking woman who cooks and the modern day girl
 ham lekhan main sach likhte hai
 Our writing is human
 ham kaaphi dwandv or sangharsh ke baad likhte hai
 It is also having an impact in society and change is taking place

 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee died on Thursday afternoon
 ve lambey samay se dilli sthit ames main bhartee the
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee used to take time to watch films even in the midst of his busy political life
 atalji ko shradhanjali dene ke liye yahaan clic karempichley saal april main bhaajapa saansad hema malini ne atal bihari vaajapeyi se judaa ek raaj kholaa tha
 He had told that Atal Bihari Vajpayee liked one of his films so much that he had seen 25 times
 yah film thi 1972 main ai 'sita or gita'
 
 
 
 jab sonia par bhadke the vaajapeyi, avishvaas prastaav par raat 11 baje sadan main diya tha javabahichkicha rahe the atalhema ne bataaya- mujhe yaad he ki ek baar maine padaadhikariyon se kaha ki main bhaashanon main atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa zikr karti hum
 But never met him, introduce him, then he took me to meet him
 lekin maine mahasoos kiya ki atal bihari vaajapeyi baat karne main kuch hichkicha rahe hai
 At this i asked a lady present there what is the matter
 atal ji, thik se baat kyon nahin kar rahe
 He told that in fact he has been a big fan of yours
 inhone 1972 main ai aapaki film 'sita or gita' 25 baar dekhi thi
 That is why he is hesitant to suddenly find you in front, let us know that sometime back the Government of India honored Atal Bihari Vajpayee with Bharat Ratna

 Businessman Vijay Mallya, who has run away with a loan of nine thousand crores, has suffered a big blow supreme court ne somvaar ko bainkon ke samooh kii taraf se daayar avmaananaa yachika par maalya ko notice jari kiya he or 4 hafte main jawaab maanga he
 In its petition, the group of banks led by State Bank of India said that despite the Supreme Court order, Mallya did not give full details of his assets
 yah court kii avmaananaa he, isliye unke khilaaf avmaananaa kii kaarywahi shuru kii jaae
 During the court proceedings for a very short time in the case, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, on behalf of a group of banks, told the court, 'the amount Mallya took loan from banks is public money
 court ke aadesh ke baavjood unhone apni sampatti kaa puraa byoraa nahin diya he, isliye uske khilaaf avmaananaa ke tahat cese chalanaa chahie
 According to the "no account of Rs 2500 crore transaction", Mallya has given incorrect details about his assets to the apex court in a sealed envelope
 unhone kaha he ki kai soochnaaon ko chupaaya gaya he, jinamein 2,500 karod rupee kaa lenden bhi shaamil he
 This is contempt of court
 bengaluru ke date recovery tribunel (DRT) kii maang par supreme court ne maalya ke khilaaf chal rahi kaarywahi ko puraa karne ke liye tribunel ko or vakt de diya he
 'mallya not cooperating in the investigation' is a matter of fact that the Supreme Court had earlier sought details of liquor businessman Vijay Mallya in a sealed envelope of his property
 bainkon ke samooh ne haal hi aarope lagaaya tha ki maalya maamle kii jaanch main sahyog nahin kar rahe hai
 Also, they are not giving information about the property that exists abroad
 bainkon ne kaha tha ki maalya or uske parivaar kii videshon main maujuud sampatti kii jaankaree usase bakaaye kii vasuuli ke maamle main kaaphi ahm hogi
 Let me tell you that Vijay Mallya is currently in Britain and there is no possibility of his return to India at the moment

 kanoonee dand se bachane ke liye deepak ne nakli vivaah samaaroh kiya, jabaki use pataa tha ki na to yah kanoonee he or na hi jaij he
 The fast court said, "it is clear from the evidence presented by the woman that Deepak performed a fake marriage ceremony in the temple
" ’atirikt satr nyaayadhish nivedita anil sharma ne kaha, ‘isse spasht he ki uskaa iraadaa kabhi bhi yuvati se vivaah kaa nahin tha
 He knew that she was a Hindu and that the woman was a Muslim

 According to the prosecution, the 20-year-old girl filed a complaint against Deepak in October 2010
 usne aarope lagaaya ki deepak ne shaadi kaa jhootha vaada kar uske saath do saal se adhik samay tak balaatkaar kiya
 The woman told police that 21-year-old Deepak lives in her neighborhood
 usne usase shaadi kaa vaada kiya tha lekin uske garbhvatee hone ke baad deepak ne usase vivaah karne se manaa kar diya or use garbhpaat karaane ke liye kaha
 Angry at Deepak's attitude, the victim approached the police
 khud ko bachaane ke liye deepak apane parivaar ke saath peedit ko mandir le gaya, donon ne ek duusare ko maalaaen pahanaayin, uski maang main sindur lagaaya or kaha ki usne uske saath vivaah kar liya

 They cannot be married unless one of the two converts to another and converts to the other
 yaa phir donon ko vishesh vivaah kanoon ke tahat vivaah kar sakate the
 'the accused was convicted of rape and convicted of fake marriage ceremony without marrying lawfully
 aaropee ke saath daihik sambandh banane ke liye yuvati kii sahmati ke sandarbh main nyaayadhish ne kaha ki sabooton se yah saaf he ki deepak ne apni bahan kii shaadi ke baad muslim yuvati se shaadi karne kaa vaada kar usase shaareerik sambandh banaae the
 The judge said, "if he does not make such a promise, then the woman does not allow him to have a sexual relationship with her
" ’ doshi ne narmi kii apil karte hue kaha tha ki vah factory main kaam karata he or puraa parivaar us par hi nirbhar he
 The court, however, denied the leniency, stating that she raped a helpless girl who easily became her victim

 On Sunday evening, patients and doctors at the Indira Gandhi Medical Institute in Patna were stunned to see a special 'visitor'
 yah aagatuk koi or nahin balki purv mukhyamantri lalu prasad yadav the, jinke bete tejpratap maujuuda nitish kumaar sarkaar main swasthya mantri hai
 The comments pehle to logon ne samajha ki lalu shaayad apane kisi parichit marij ko dekhne aae hai, lekin santhaan ke nideshak or anya varisht doctoron ko turant samaj main aa gaya ki lalu apane anokhe andaaj main is santhaan kaa auchak nirikshan karne pahunche hai
 Lalu started questioning the patients and took stock of several wards
 agar lalu ke saath unke bete tejpratap ( bihar ke swasthya mantri) hote to shaayad vah vipaksh ke sawaalon ke bauchhaaron se batch sakate the
 The opposition will definitely raise the issue of Lalu's surprise visit in the coming days
 sampark kiye jane par lalu ne kaha, main ek nijee aspataal main ek marij ko dekhne gaya tha, raste main main aijimes main ruk gaya, taaki vahaan kii sthiti dekh sakuun
 In 1997, after being sent to judicial custody in the fodder scam, Lalu lived in IGIMS for several months, but in a VIP room
 lalu kaa yah auchak daura nishchit rup se nitish sarkaar ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 Senior doctors say that neither Nitish nor any of the officials of his office have ever said anything directly to him during the last 10 years
 agar kabhi jarurat padi to vah adhikrut swasthya adhikari ke jariye aagrah bhijwaya jaataa tha
 At first people understood that Lalu might have come to see some of his acquaintance patients, but the institute's director and other senior doctors immediately understood that Lalu had come to surprise the institute in his own unique way
 lalu marijon se poochtacha karne lage or unhone kai vaardon kaa jayja liya
 If Lalu had been accompanied by his son Tejapratap (bihar's health minister), perhaps he could have avoided the barrage of questions from the opposition
 vipaksh aane vaale dinon main lalu ke is auchak daure kaa mudda jarur uchhaalenge
 When contacted, Lalu said, "I went to see a patient in a private hospital, on the way i stopped at IGIMS to see the situation there
" varsh 1997 main chaara ghotaale main nyaayik hiraasat main bheje jane ke baad lalu aijimes main kai maheenon tak rahe the, lekin ek viipi kamare main
 This surprise visit of Lalu can definitely cause trouble for Nitish government
 varisht doctoron kaa kahana he ki pichley 10 saalon ke dauraan na to nitish ne or na hi unke daftar ke kisi adhikari ne kabhi sidhe unase kuch kaha ho
 If ever needed, the request was sent through the authorized health officer
 agar lalu ke saath unke bete tejpratap ( bihar ke swasthya mantri) hote to shaayad vah vipaksh ke sawaalon ke bauchhaaron se batch sakate the
 The opposition will definitely raise the issue of Lalu's surprise visit in the coming days
 sampark kiye jane par lalu ne kaha, main ek nijee aspataal main ek marij ko dekhne gaya tha, raste main main aijimes main ruk gaya, taaki vahaan kii sthiti dekh sakuun

 'fog lights do not show a googly' Pujara, who played 166 and unbeaten 256 in two matches of the Duleep Trophy, said, "it is a good preparation for the New Zealand series and i am looking forward to it
" mujhe hameshaa lagata he ki jab bhi main tik jaau to mujhe badi pari khelni he or team kii madad kerani he
 'pujara said that he enjoyed playing with the pink ball but still has problems seeing Googly
 unhone kaha, ‘maine pink ball se khilne kaa lutf uthaaya lekin kuch chunautiyaan hai visheshkar dudhia roshni main jab gugali ko dekhnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Yuvraj Singh is disappointed and he is also surprised that his bowlers did not perform as expected
 ‘rahasy he pink ball kaa swing karnaa’pink ball ke bare main poochne par yuvaraj ne hairaani bharaa jawaab diya
 He said, 'it is somewhat difficult to react to this (on the pink ball) because when we were bowling, the ball was not swinging very much whereas when it was bowling it was swinging

 ' barish ke mausam main chhattisgarh ke logon ne andaja laga liya tha ki jis tarah se monsoon kaa rukh najar aa rahaa he wo mushkil halaat paidaa kar saktaa he
 The apprehensions of the people proved to be true and the water level is continuously decreasing in all the big dams of the state
 isaki vajah he barish ke mausam main apekshit jal bharaav kaa nahin hona
 In fact, there are about 44 small dams in the state of Chhattisgarh and out of these 28 dams have a water level of less than 60%
 jabaki 10 saamaanya jalashay lagbhag 80 fisadi tak bhare hai
 In such a situation, it is difficult to say whether people will get enough water for four months of winter and four months of summer
 pradesh ke baandhon main pani kii kami ke kaaran sarkaar ne kisaanon ko saaf kah diya he ki wo rabi ke mausam main dhan kii fasal naa lagaaein kyonki sarkaar har saal unhen jis tarah baandhon ke jariye pani muhaiyaa karaati he, vaisaa nahin karvaa paaegi
 The reason for this is being told the drought conditions in the state
 rajya main sookhe kii vajah se ground water level 800 se 1200 feet neeche tak chalaa gaya he, jabaki rajya ke 44 baandhon main ausat se bhi kam barish hone se jal bharaav nahin ho paaya he
 Out of these, 18 dams are on the verge of drying up
 in baandhon main bharaa pani dinon din kam hota ja rahaa he
 It is expected that these dams may dry up before the summer season arrives
 in halaat main thand or garmi ke chaar- chaar maheene yani aath maheene tak logon ko donon vakt pani muhaiyaa karana sarkaar ke liye tedi kheer sabit hoga, lihaaja sarkaar ne kisaanon ko adhik jal kii khapat vaali fasalein lagane se roak diya he
 Even the paddy and basmati rice crop has been banned in the Rabi season
 sarkaar ne iskaa ulanghan karne par kisaanon ko kadi kaarywahi kii chetavanee di he
 The government has also said that it will not provide water to the farmers from dams and canals for this
 unke pampon ke bijli conection bhi kaat die jaaenge, udhar kisaan sarkaar ke faislon ko kaala kanoon bataa rahe hai
 In hundreds of villages of the state, people are already forced to bring water from many kilometers away
 sarkaar ne nagar panchayat, nagar palikaon or nagar nigamon ko alert jari kar kaha he ki jal sankat ko dekhte hue pine kaa pani uplabdh karaane ke liye hand pump sudhaare jaaen, nae borwell kii vyavastha kii jaae or pine ke pani ke liye bhi chrysis management ke tahat faisle liye jaaen
 Under this, water reduction will be implemented soon in both urban and rural areas under government drinking water system

 Bollywood filmmakers are using new technology every day
 akshay kumaar kii aane vaali film "baby" ke ection seen ke liye nirdeshak niraj pandey ne "octocopter drone" camere kaa istemaal kiya he
 The director Neeraj Pandey, who wanted to show some action-packed scenes of the film "baby", was not able to do the same thing by shooting with a common camera, so the "octocopter Drone" camera was specially sourced and shot
 is camere ke zariye abu dhabi ke registan main tej-tarraar ection seen filmaae gaye
 These scenes have been directed by Hollywood's famous action director Cyril Rafaeli and perhaps this is the reason why the film's promo is a different feeling
 is "octocopter drone" camere ke istemaal ke baad cameraman (DOP) sudeep chatarji ne kaha ki ab ham bhi takneekee taur par satark ho gaye hai
 Me and Neeraj wanted to do something different so we used this camera
 isse shoot karne ke baad drishyon ko dekhne kaa mazaa hi kuch or he
 If we go in a little flashback, then in the Akshay Kumar film "hey Baby", director Sajid Khan used a camera, which after shooting the child's face changed it from inside the camera to show the laughing baby's face
 
 akshay kii hi film "mujhase shaadi karogi" main ek aise camere se shoot kiya gaya tha, jisamen ek aadmi kii 10 image dikhaai detii thi
 If you have seen the film 'mujhse Shaadi Karogi', you must have also seen the scene where Salman was fighting alone with many Akshay
 yah vahi seen tha, jiske liye khaas camera laayaa gaya tha
 Not just the camera
 
 Bollywood is also moving in the technology of special effects and graphics
 film "krish3" ke special iffect or graphix aapako yaad honge
 These also point towards progress
 film "baing baing" kaa jabardast ection or special iffect bhi sabake saamne he
 Of course
 
 Change is the law of nature

 If such an alert is issued, it is very different
 'jammu-kashmir main 25 hajaar jawan or bheje jaaenge

 What “on going situation” in Kashmir would require the army AND the Air Force to be put on alert? This isn't about 35A or delimitation

 videsh niti par trump se unka lagaataar takaraav rahaa he
 Bolton, who has opposed peace talks with the Taliban, used strong words when US President Donald Trump sacked John Bolton on Tuesday
 unhone kaha ki unhen white house main unki seva kii ab jarurat nahin he
 Bolton is considered an expert on American foreign policy
 white house main unki pahchaan sakht diplomat ke rup main he, jo america hiton kii raksha ke liye kade kadamon kii pairvi karte hai

 mcmaster was replaced by Trump in April 2018
 lekin trump ke saath unki jodi saal bhar hi chali
 He had become so powerful in the White House that he had a collision with Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo
 trump ne kuch dinon tak to unhen badi jimmedaariyaan deen, lekin dhire-dhire trump unase chidhane lage, halaat aise bane ki trump ne jon bolton ko 'fire' kar diya
 What was the reason that the distance between Trump and Bolton increased
 darasal iske peeche donon netaaon ke bich badhata avishvaas he
 NSA John Bolton strongly opposed this when President Trump announced his desire to negotiate with the Taliban at Camp David at White House for Afghanistan peace talks
 jon bolton ne kaha ki aisa karke raashtrapati ek aatanki samooh ko manyata de denge
 According to Foreign Policy magazine, Bolton believed that calling leaders of a terrorist group at Camp David would lead to a wrong practice
 bolton ke virodh kaa nateeja ye niklaa ki raashtrapati dabaav main aa gaye or aakhirkaar taliban ke saath shanti vaarta radd ho gai
 According to a CNN report, there was a heated debate between the two leaders on the issue on Monday night

 The French president was trying to get a meeting during the UN meeting between Macron, Trump and Rouhani
 bolton kai manchon par iskaa virodh kar chuke the
 The bureaucrat who stood against the boss was a bureaucrat of Bolton Trump who stood up against his boss on all policy issues
 darasal aakraamak videsh niti ke pairokaar bolton trump dwaara kisi bhi riyaayat kaa virodh karte the
 Apart from the Taliban and Iran, the two leaders also differed on issues like North Korea and Venezuela
 is saal ye report ai ki trump venezuela par bolton kii galat salaah se khafa the, kyonki venezuela main america niti ko munh kii khaani padi thi
 Concerned about the image, trumptrump had also been feeling for the last few days that John Bolton was not able to put his side in the media strongly and was hurting him
 darasal media main bhi ye baat failati hi ja rahi ki jon bolton trump kii videsh niti main puure taur par yakeen hi nahin karte hai
 Let us know that the Presidential elections are to be held in America soon and Trump was not in any way to tolerate the loss of his image on such an occasion

 Walking from Ramlila Maidan, when the farmers reached Parliament Road, the footsteps of the passers-by did not stay for long
 sadak se sansad tak kisaanon kii kai reliyaan dekh chuke dillivaasiyon ke liye ab hajaaron mile dur se aae kisaanon kaa hujum kuch khaas kautuhal kaa vishay nahin rahaa
 "I am also from a farmer's home," says Nand Patel, an engineer by profession who has settled in Delhi
 banaras ke choubepur main meraa ghar he
 Initially, when thousands of farmers used to come to Delhi, it seemed that this time there will be panic in the minds of the leaders
 kisaanon kii awaajen sansad main hangaamaa khadaa karengi
 But now it seems that the walls of Parliament are so strong that the pleas of the peasants collide from there and crumble
 ’’ darasal nand patel kii ye line raajnneeti main betarah ulajh chuke kisaanon ke dukh kii abhivyakti he
 Manish, a student of social work at Delhi University, is involved in such movements every time
 ve kehete hai, pichhlaa andolan 2 oktober ko hua tha, jab kisaan apane trek-trali lekar dilli kii seemaa par aa pahunche the
 But is there any achievement of that movement? The government caught the lollipops and sent the farmers back
 jabaki raily main shaamil kisaan, dhyaan rakhie netaa nahin! mahinebhar kaa rashan-pani lekar aae the phir aisa kya hua ki unhen bina maange manwaae ulate paanv lautnaa padaa?is baar bhi yahi hua, manch par bade-bade netaa aae
 Attacked the ruling party
 chunaav ke liye muft main khulaa manch mila
 Made sharp statements and then went on
 sach to yah he ki ‘kisaan mukti march’ ke manch kaa sabase zyada phayda rahul gandhi ko hua
 He was followed by Sitaram Yechury, Sharad Pawar, Arvind Kejriwal, Farooq Abdullah, d Raja
 balki main to kahata hum ki kisaanon kii samasya uthaane se zyada ye manch in netaaon ke vajood ko bachaane kaa jariya hai
 Ask Arvind Kejriwali, are the farmers happy in Delhi? The bottom line is that once again the farmers knocked strongly at the rate of Delhi
 lekin is dastak kaa asar kitna hoga? ise lekar zyaadaatar logon ke man main andeh he
 Raju Setty, the head of the Swabhiman Shetkari organization and always vocal on the issue of farmers, says on this question, it is true that every government of the farmer has been unheard of
 lekin is baar hamane 21 raajnneeti dalon ko ek manch par kisaanon ke muddon ko lekar ikattha kiya
 Because without political support farmers can never get their right
 darasal raju shetty or anya netaa milakar do nijee vidheyak bhi laa rahe hai
 The first is the 'right to be fully debt free to farmers Bill-2018' and the second is 'right to get one and a half times the cost to farmers-2018'
 lekin yahaan sawaal uthta he ki kya nijee vidheyak ke paarit hone kii sambhaavna he? is par ve kehete hai, hamen pataa he ki itihaas main abhi tak ek baar bhi nijee member vidheyak paas nahin hua
 That is why we are engaged in the exercise of making it official by taking the support of 21-22 political parties
 raju shetty kisaan sambandhi vidheyakon par charchaa ke liye vishesh sansad satr kii maang bhi kar rahe hai
 However, he did not get any assurance this time too

 Wishing to get the blessings of Sakshat Mahadev or the desire to conquer death, the attendance at Mahamrityunjaya temple for Shiva devotees is like being a part of the virtue
 varanasi ke maidagin kshetra main bholenath mrityunjay mahadev ke rup main virajte hai
 Every wish of the mind is fulfilled only by his philosophy
 manyata he ki yadi koi bhakt lagaataar 40 somvaar yahaan hajiri lagaae or trilochan ke is rup ko phulon ke saath doodh or jal chadaaye to uske jivan se kashton kaa nivaaran kshan bhar main ho jaataa he
 In the Mahamrityunjaya temple of Varanasi, devotees and pandits are constantly engaged in chanting so that Mahadev can be blessed by his blessings
 akaal mrityu se mukti pai ja sake
 Chanting mantras chants a quarter of a million times, new stories of miracles are written daily in the temple of Mahamrityunjaya
 mandir main din main 3 baar hone vaali aarti ke darshan kar bhakt banate hai punya ke bhaagi
 By the way, here Shiva fulfills all the wishes of the devotees
 lekin visheshtaur par yahaan mrityu ke dar par milti he vijay
 It is believed that if the mantra of Mahamrityujanya is chanted a quarter of a million times in this temple, the risk of premature death hovering over the head goes away forever
 kundali dekhakar vishesh tithi main mantra japavaise to somvaar ko is mantra kaa jaap faldaayi mana jaataa he lekin phir bhi jyotishiyon se salaah mashvira karne ke baad hi vishesh tithi par hi is mantra kaa jaap karnaa uchit mana jaataa he
 Actually, seeing the horoscope of the native, astrologers tell how big the risk of death is on the native
 isi hisaab se mantra ke jaap or puja kii taarikh tay kii jaati he
 The chanting of Mahamrityunjaya mantra not only removes the risk of premature death but also the effects of cruel planets like rahu-ketu and Shani can be reduced

 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will reply to the debate in the House on the issue in the assembly session starting on Monday

 However, farmers may get a partial loan waiver or interest waiver

 The attack on the proposal of the debt waiver of the farmers by the opposition has been fiercely debated in the assembly for two days on Thursday and Friday

 NCP leader Ajit Pawar said on this issue, 'sugarcane grower farmers, cotton grower farmers, milk grower farmers, fruit grower farmers of Maharashtra are all suffering from weather and debt

 He should get rid of debt
 'kya he sarkaar kaa tarkbijeypi netaa ekanath khadse ne karj maafee kaa virodh karte hue kaha tha, '2008 main jab kisaanon ko karj mukti di gai thi to uskaa phayda kisaanon ko nahin, balki sahakaari bainkon ko hua tha
 Today, if the farmers were given a loan waiver, from where would 24000 crore rupees come? Therefore, the Chief Minister wants to work to improve the economic condition of the farmers rather than waiving the debt

 somvaar ko is vidheyak ke paksh main jediu, shivasena, bijedy or purvottar ke kuch dalon ke saath aane ke chalate yah aasaani se paas ho gaya tha
 But the government's passing this bill in the Rajya Sabha will be the ultimate litmus test

 Former mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton described Gautam Gambhir as a mentally insecure player in his new book but also said that this could not prevent him from being included in one of India's most successful batsmen

 Upton wrote in his book, 'I did my best work with Gambhir but it was the least effective of those who were the best international Test cricketers of the year in 2009
 maine unke saath tab tak hi kaam kiya tha lekin unke duniya ke sarvshereshth cricketer chune jane se meraa kuch bhi lenaa dena nahin tha
 Upton said in it how this left-handed opener was unhappy despite scoring a century and his emphasis was on his mistakes
 unhone likhaa, 'jab vah 150 ran banaata tha tab bhi vah niraash hota tha ki usne 200 ran kyon nahin banaaye
 But the former opener Gambhir is not hurt by this
 raajnneeti main utarkar purvi dilli se chunaav lard rahe gambhir ne kaha, 'main khud ko or bhartiya team ko duniya main sarvshereshth bananaa chahta tha
 That is why i was not satisfied even after scoring 100 as mentioned in Paddy's book
 mujhe isamen kuch bhi galat nahin dikhataa
 Upton wrote that even though he and then coach Gary Kirsten did everything with Gambhir, the player was 'negative and pessimistic'
 haalanki unhone maansik majbootee se jude myth or virodhabhaason ko samajhaate hue kaha, 'maansik majbootee kii dharna ke antargat maine jin logon ke saath kaam kiya tha unamem vah sabase kamjor or maansik rup se sabase asurakshit logon main se ek tha
 He added, "but at the same time there is no doubt that he was one of the best, most determined and successful Test batsmen in the world
" yahi cheez usne phir se 2011 vishwa cap final main sabit kii
 In this chapter, Upton spoke of the 'best emotional control' of former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni

 jab unhone complaint kii to unhen amejan kii taraf se bataaya gaya ki vah package cield tha or usamen koi gadabadi nahin thi
 After 'amazon refused to give the money', he emailed the Amazon officials about the incident and filed a complaint, but in response to his email, he said on behalf of Amazon, 'we are sorry for your problems
 hamane aapke maamle ko phulfilment centre main darj karaayaa jahaan se hamen is baat kii pushti hui he ki product deliver hote samay puri tarah cield tha
 There has been no mistake on our part and we cannot refund you for this'
 amejan ne email ke riplai main yah bhi likhaa ki is maamle main wo unki koi madad nahin kar sakate
 'will take legal action' It is significant that even before this, e-commerce companies have done fooling people by sending RIN detergents or stones in the package, but they took responsibility for it and returned the customer money
 par amejan ne unhen paise lautaane se saaf inkaar kar diya he
 Uttam says that he will fight for it and will punish those who have cheated on him

 Deepa Karmakar, 22, qualified for Gymnastics Women's Artistic Gymnastics: Gymnastics Test Event, Rio Achievements: Bronze at the 2014 Commonwealth Games; Bronze medals at the 2015 Asian Gymnastics Championships are at 8 in the morning and the morning session is going on at the Gymnastics Arena in Delhi's Indira Gandhi Stadium Complex
 sabhi athlete kadi mashkkat main jute hai lekin sabhi nazren 22 saal kii ek ladki par tiki hai
 The three coaches present there also seem to be paying attention to the acrobatics of a small, thin girl
 deepa karmaakar akeli bhartiya jimnast hai jinhone rio ke liye kwalifoi kiya he
 She is also the first female gymnast in the country to qualify for this biggest sporting event in the world
 lekin keval yahi baat nahin he jo unhen khaas banaati he
 Karmakar is also drawing attention because she has a slightly higher chance of reaching the podium, and because her mastery in the extremely difficult and dangerous Produnova vault has forced people to look back, wherever she has gone so far
 is walt yaa chalaang kaa naam diggaj roosi jimnast elena produnova ke naam par rakhaa gaya tha
 In this, the gymnast jumps with great force on the strength of his hands and eats two and a half acrobatics and then standing on the ground facing the front stands upright
 pichley saal november main vishwa championships main deepa ke produnova walt se jaj or darshak itane prabhavit hue ki jimnastics kii matra sanstha federation international da jimnastics ne unke ''vishwa stareey jimnast" hone kii tasdik karte hue prashansapatr diya tha
 Incidentally, the Produnova vault has the highest Karmakar score in the world: 15
 300, jisamen difiklti ke liye 7
 000 and 8 for execution
 300 hai
 It is such a rare and risky leap that very few gymnasts dare to do it and only five have been able to do it so far
 deepa kahati hai, ''main jaanati hum ki produnova walt khatarnaak he
 But i have been doing this for the last two years
 kuch paane ke liye aapako thodaa jokhim to lenaa hi hota he
 "she also says," i have been training for the Olympics since 2015
 rio main meraa pehla lakshya final muqablon main pahunchnaa hoga or uske baad jaisaa hoga vaisaa kiya jayega
 "this is the leap Karmakar has mastered and this is the feat on which she will try to succeed in Rio
 board par tej daud, safai se oochaal bharna, hawa main kalabaziyaan khaanaa, kushan ko halke-se choona or phir majbootee se jameen par utarana—yahi ve chijen hai jo unhen jimnastics ke apane is puure safar main dusron se alag or khaas banaati hai
 He won a bronze medal in the vault at the 2014 Commonwealth Games
 yah antarrashtriya mukaable main kisi bhi bhartiya mahila kaa pehla padak tha

 Now that only two weeks have passed, Karmakar knows that he is in the last phase of his preparations
 intervyuu ke liye unke paas vakt nahin he, yahaan tak ki photo shoot ke liye bhi nahin
 She spends every moment meditating on the last stage of her preparations for Rio
 ji-tod mehnat se bhare 8 ghante ke prashikshan satron kaa matlab he ki unke paas kisi bhi or cheez ke liye vakt nahin he
 Manjushree Roy, administrator of the Sports Authority of India at the complex, says, "I take complete care to ensure that he does not have to worry about anything else - from his diet to massage and psychological advice
" "agartala main 1993 main janmi deepa kaa unke pita dulaal karmaakar ne chah saal kii choti umr se hi khelon se taaruf karvaa diya tha

 "it was never easy to dream of an Olympic medal with Deepa," says Nandi
 ve jab pehali baar mere paas ain thi tab uske panje sapaat the
 
 
 This is a major drawback for the dreamer of being a gymnast as it makes it difficult to make the leap
 lekin main jaanata tha ki ve khaas hai or vakt ke saath lagaataar abhyaas se hamane uske panjon ko mode liya
 "within hours of qualifying for the Olympics, Karmakar captured gold in the final of the vault at the Olympic Test event
 yah pehla mauka tha jab ek bhartiya mahila ne vaishvik jimnastic mukaable main swarna padak jeeta tha
 Billions of Indians will be hoping to repeat this feat in Rio next month as well

 Torrent banning is not new
 aae din duniyabar main ise band karne kii muhim chalati rahati he, lekin inhen band karnaa naammumkin sa lagata he, kyonki jitani bhi torant cites ko band kiya gaya he wo duusare tareeke se abhi bhi yuj kii jaati hai
 Take the famous torrent website The Pirate Bay as an example
 america sarkaar ne iske lagbhag sabhi sarvars ko nishaanaa banaaya or puri tarah se bain kiya
 Not only this, the founder was also arrested and sang
 in sab ke baavjood aaj bhi da pyret be se log filmein,software, gane or videos downalodkar rahe hai
 Although it is not as easy as before, but it is still happening
 da pyret be ke alaava kickeas or extra torant websites bhi hai jinhen samay samay par band kiya jaataa he
 In India also, the Department of Telecom has asked Internet service providers to strictly block these torrent websites and they have also been blocked
 bain ke baavjood aise yuj kiya jaataa he torantkate hai internet par har cheez kii kaat maujuud he, thik aise hi block torant website ko kholane ke tareeke bhi hai
 Those who have little internet and proxy knowledge easily download torrents
 kya he proxi or kaise karata he kamkisi bhi block website jaise torant kii kisi bhi URL ko kholane ke liye basic tul proxi he
 Let's take an example to understand what a proxy server is
 maan lijie aapke offis main fasebuk ko block kiya gaya he yani internal network kii ypi se fasebuk open karne ke liye aap request karenge to website nahin khulegi
 But if you use the proxy server to open Facebook, it will open
 aisa isliye kyonki aapaki ypi badal jaati he or badali hui ypi se fasebuk open karne kaa request jaataa he
 The same goes with torrents
 website block hone ke baavjood proxi ke jariye duusari ypi se us website ko kholaa ja saktaa he
 However, websites opened through a proxy are slower than the original ones
 torant ke domen band hone par aise hoti he dowlodingkai deshon kii sarkaar torant kii website ko bain karne ke saath useinternet se hataa detii hai
 In this case, hackers running those torrent websites shift it to another domain
 torant kii mashhoor websites in dinon duusare naam se chal rahi hai
 However, this name is similar to the original, so those who download continuously from torrents get an idea of it
 iske alaava kai aise proxi tuls bhi hai jo aapke computer or broujar main install ho kar ypi bypass karne kaa kaam karte hai
 Also, people easily open torrent websites and download them
 aapako bataa den ki torant se dowloding avaidh he or iske liye sajaa kaa bhi praavdhaan he
