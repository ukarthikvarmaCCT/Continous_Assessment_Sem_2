 Land acquisition for the bullet train is becoming a problem for the Modi government
 gujarat or maharashtra main kai jagah ke kisaan jameen adhigrahan kaa virodh kar hi rahe hai, ab desh ke diggaj kaarobaari samooh godarej ne bhi bullate train ke liye jameen adhigrahan kaa virodh kiya he
 Actually around 3 of Godrej Group in Mumbai
 5 hectare jameen bullate train ke raste main aa rahi he, jisaki bazaar keemat kareeb 500 karod rupee he
 According to Business Standard, the Godrej group has moved the Bombay High Court to protest against the acquisition of its Vikhroli-based property for the bullet train project
 iskaa matlab yah he ki agar bullate train pariyojna kaa rasta nahin badla gaya, to yah mukademebaaji main funs saktaa he
 However, the government has the option of forcibly acquiring land as per Maharashtra Land Acquisition Act, 2013
 gauratlab he ki mumbai se ahmedabad kii 508 kimi kii duuri ke liepiem modi keemhatvakankshi bullate train pariyojna par kaam shuru ho chukaa he
 It is said that 21 km of this route will be underground
 ek sarkari adhikari ke mutabik godarej ne pariyojna ke maarg main badlaav karne kii maang kii he taaki uske samooh kii company godarej construction kii jameen raste main na aae
 There have been many obstacles in the way of bullet train project even before this
 pichley maheene maharashtra main palghar ke fal utpaadakon ne jameen adhigrahan kaa virodh kiya tha
 Earlier, farmers in Surat have opposed land acquisition
 maharashtra main agle saal chunaav he, isliye is maamle main raajnneeti bhi khub ho rahi he
 The project requires 1,047 hectares of land in Gujarat and 353 hectares in Maharashtra
 jameen adhigran ke liye neshnal hai speed railway corporation limited ne 10,000 karod rupee kaa bajet tay kar rakhaa he
 The deadline for land acquisition has been fixed till December 2018, but it does not appear that it will be followed now
 bullate train pariyojna taiyaar hone ke baad mumbai seahmadabad kii yatrasirf 3 ghante main puri ho jaaegi, jabaki abhi isamen saat ghante lag jate hai
 Total 1 on this project
 08 lakh karod rupee kii laagat aane kaa anumaan he
 Ayushmann Khurrana's film Dream Girl has been released in theaters
 is film kaa intjaar phens ko kaaphi samay se tha
 The film's trailer, promos and songs received a lot of public love
 itnaa hi nahin bollywood ke celebs ne bhi is film ko dekhne ke baad isaki khub tarif kii
 After hearing so much praise and watching the interesting trailer and promo, the excitement of seeing the film is bound to increase
 lekin ayushmaan khurana kii film dream girl dekhne se pehle aapke liye kuch baaten jaananaa jaruri he
 There are many shortcomings in this film, which makes this film slightly worse than expected
 aaie aapako bataate hai inke bare main-kharaab screenple or treetmentfilm kii lokation se lekar raftaar or riting sab chizon main kami saaf dikhti he
 The film, which started at a slow pace, could never catch a pace
 kabhi ye tej chalati he to kabhi dhimi pad jaati he
 Not only this, in many places it also gives knowledge of waste
 iske alaava kuch sikvence kahin se kahin pahunch jate hai
 It seems strange to hear the song coming in the middle of a scene
 iske alaava film kaa clymex bilkul bhi mjedaar nahin tha
 It tried to show confusion, turmoil and fun but to no avail
 achche actors kii barbaadiannu kapur, rajesh sharma or abhishek chatterjee bollywood ke kuch badhiya actors main se ek hai
 We have also seen the pair of Annu Kapoor and Ayushmann Khurrana doing amazing in the film Vicky Donor
 lekin is baar annu ke kirdaar ko utane badhiya dhang se pesh nahin kiya gaya
 He definitely did wonders in the screen time that Annu Kapoor got
 abhishek bannerjee or rajesh sharma ko bhi ham sabhi ne acha kaam karte dekha he
 In such a situation, it would have been wonderful if both of them had been given a bit more screen time

 The reason for the film Tarathi Ho being a superhit was his good comedy
 iske alaava ham sabhi ne ayushmaan ko pichley kaaphi samay main badhiya filmon ko chunate hue dekha he
 But Dream Girl is different from all the rest of his films
 is film main aapako achche jokes to milenge lekin iske saath aapako sexiest jokes or kuch behuda baaten bhi dekhne ko milengi
 Apart from this, there have been many times when the film also tries unsuccessfully to make you laugh
 yahi baaten is film ko antertaning kam or sir dard zyada banaati hai
 Stereotype This film also lacks that which we have seen in many films
 isamen logon ko or chizon ko steriotip kiya gaya he
 If you fall in love with a Muslim person, you will change your religion, start speaking Urdu, wear a kurta pajama, put on a white safa, paint the house green and open a perfume shop
 kyonki normal muslim insaan aisa hi hota he, hai naa? yahi baaten is film ko niraashajanak banaati hai
 Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav today attacked both the Congress and the BJP, beating the electoral table in Varanasi
 unhone kaha ki jahaan congress ne bhrashtachar ke sivaae kuch nahin kiya, vahiin bijepi ke piem in vatting narendra modi ke haath khun se range hue hai
 Even before these rallies, the war of words between BJP and SP intensified
 sapa ne kaha ki bijepi kii raily main ped varkar yani kiraye ke log aate hai
 At the same time, BJP said that Patwari, Tehsildar, SDM and DM come to the SP rally
 donon partiyon ne apni-apni reliyon main badi bheed jutaney kaa daawa kiya
 SP spokesperson and minister in the state government Rajendra Chaudhary said that RSS workers and paid workers attend Modi's rally
 jabaki, sapa kii raily main garib log, kisaan or musalmaan aate hai, aam janata or mahilaayein aati hai
 Chaudhary said, 'muslims do not go to the RSS rally, nor do the farmers go
 unki raily main unke sanghathan ke hi log hote hai
 Our rally is always big
 'bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi ne aarope lagaaya ki sapa kii raily main sarkari amala jutata he
 He said that SP is deliberately rallying from the last three rallies on the same day that the BJP rallies
 isse saaf he ki sapa ke netaaon ke man main modi kaa dar baitha hua he
 Vajpayee claimed that Mulayam's rally would not be half as crowded as Modi's rally
 gauratlab he ki yah teesri baar hoga jab mulaayam kii raily modi kii raily ke saath ho rahi he
 Earlier on 21 November, Modi's rally was in Agra, then Samajwadi Party's rally was in Bareilly
 uske baad 23 disambar ko modi kii raily banaras main thi tab samaajawaadee party ne badaayun main jansabha kaa kaarykram kiya tha
 Ram Asare Vishwakarma, minister of state in UP government and co-incumbent of Mulayam's Varanasi rally, says that the SP has a history that the party does not take cognizance of the rally of others
 sapa kii reliyon main jutane vaali bheed kaa record khud sapa netaaon kii raily ne hi todaa he

 garbhavastha ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen har mahila ke anubhav alag hote hai
 Who does not like the love and care received during this time? zyaadaatar mahilaon ke liye jivan kaa yah daur behad sukhad or yaadgaar hota he
 But in today's fraught life, our changed and chaotic lifestyle affects pregnancy to a great extent
 kabhi-kabhi kaam or kariyar banane ke liye ham family planing ko taalte rahete hai
 In such a situation, when that happiness is destined for you, many times it brings with you many complexities related to age and lifestyle
 
 
 inhen main se ek he lau laaing placecenta yaa plamcenta privia
 These 6 types of contraceptives you must know saral shabdon main kahen to is tarah ke maamlo main garbhanal yaa placenta jo bachche ke vikaas main ahm role nibhaataa he, thik garbhashay ke munh par sthit ho jaataa he
 Which can prove to be dangerous in many ways
 is tarah ke maamle kai baar baari raktasrav kaa kaaran ban sakate hai or khatra paidaa kar sakate hai
 If there is a problem of law-replacing placenta even in the last stages of pregnancy, it can be quite risky
 aisi sthiti main garbhvatee ko bistar par aaraam karne kii salaah di jaati he
 Now IVF is also failing, what is the reason 
 
 haalaaki garbhavastha ke antim charan main agar placenta greeva ko dhak le, to yah saamaanya yaa prakritik prasav ke dauraan bachche ke baahar nikalne ke raste ko puri tarah se roak detii he, aise main sijerian oparation hi ek rasta bachataa he
 Miracle! Healthy baby born from 'womb' of dead woman 
 
 - doctor swati bharadwaj kaa kahana he ki yah samasya kaaphi had tak mahila kaa umr par bhi nirbhar karti he
 If the pregnant woman is 30 years or older, then the chances of having placenta praevia are more
 - kai baar yah samasya un garbhvatee mahilaon main dekhne ko milti he, jinka pehle sijerian oparation ho chukaa ho
 - This problem can also occur in smoking etc
 women
 - agar kisi mahila ne garbhashay se judi koi surgery karai he, to placenta privia kii samasya kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Home remedies that can help prevent unwanted pregnancies yadi blimding ke dauraan turant upachaar nahin diya jaataa, to zyada raktastrav yaa hamerej hona garbh main bachche ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 So go to the doctor immediately and get treatment
 in mahilaon ko hoti hai garbhadhaaran main samasya!or khabaron ke lieclic karen

 Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav will attend this rally on behalf of the Samajwadi Party
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee bhi is raily main hissaa lengi
 Apart from this, d Raja of CPI and TKS Ilangovan of DMK will also be involved

 However, even before Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Mayawati did not attend the rally, the exercise to form a grand alliance has suffered a major setback
 lalu yadav kii raily main sabaki nazren jediu ke purv rashtriya adhyaksh or rajyasabha saansad sharad yadav ko lekar rahegi
 Sharad Yadav has announced that he will join Lalu's rally
 gauratlab he ki,mahagathbandhan se alag hokarbhajpa ke saath sarkaar banane ke nitish kumaar ke faisle kaa lagaataar sharad yadav virodh kar rahe hai or nitish ke is faisle ko 2015 ke janadesh kaa apmaan bhi bataa rahe hai
 Sharad Yadav did not attend the JDU National Executive meeting on August 19, and on the same day he organized a parallel program called 'jan Adalat' in Patna itself and announced that he was just formed with the Grand Alliance Has happened
 sharad yadav ne jis tareeke se party ke khilaaf baagi tevar apana liye hai usase nitish kumaar kaaphi naaraaz hai or unhen party se nikaalane kii atakalein bhi tej hai lekin ab tak unke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii gai he
 However, JDU general secretary KC Tyagi has made it clear that if Sharad Yadav joins Lalu's rally, it will be his last day in the party
 is vajah se sabaki nazren is raily ke dauraan sharad yadav par hogi jinhone lalu kii raily main shirkat karne kaa elaan kar diya he
 The BJP and JDU have accused Lalu of organizing this rally to save his and his family's benami property

 dilli kii tees hajaari court parisar main vakeelon or pulicekarmiyon ke bich hinsak jhadap kaa dilli hoicourt ne sangyaan liya he
 While hearing the matter, the court has issued notice to the Central Government, Government of Delhi, Bar Council of India, Bar Council of Delhi, Bar Council of all districts and Bar Council of Delhi High Court
 court ne kaha ki ham kal bhi 4 ghante baithe the or aaj bhi baithe hai
 We want that the matter should be resolved by mutual agreement, everyone should try for it
 aapako bataa den ki ek din pehle hidilli ke tees hajaari court main vakeelon or pulicekarmiyon ke bich jamkar marpet hui
 Kick-punches went on and arson
 is maamle main donon paksh ek-duusare par aarope laga rahe hai
 Actually, the whole matter started on Saturday afternoon
 kareeb 2:30 baje ek vakil ne jab lowep ke baahar apni car park kerani chaahi to lowep kii suraksha main tainaat ek pulicekarmi se car park karne ko lekar uski bahes ho gai

 As the fire was set just outside the lockup, 128 prisoners locked in the lockup suffocated
 kisi tarah pulicekarmiyon ne lowep se pani daalkar aag bujhaai
 After this, the lawyers closed all the gates of the court and broke the mobiles of the people making the video
 kai patrakaron ko peeta
 Special commissioner Sanjay Singh arrived at around 4:15 pm

 tippaniyan NDA presidential candidate Ramnath Kovind will arrive in Chandigarh on Thursday with the intention of securing the votes of mlas and mps from Haryana and Punjab in his favor
 vahaan kovind ne tamaam partiyon ke vidhayakon or saansadon ko mulaakaat karne kaa nyauta bheja he
 If we talk about Punjab and Haryana, so far other parties, except Congress and BJP, have not made their position clear about the presidential election
 punjab main congress kii sarkaar he or congress ke paas 77 vidhayak hai, jinaki vot vailu 8932 banati he, jabaki 18 vidhayakon vaali akali-bijepi kii vot vailu 2028 he
 Apart from this, the vote value of 20 mlas of Aam Aadmi Party and Lok Insaaf Party is 2552
 is tarah puure punjab ke 117 vidhayakon kii vot vailu 13572 he
 Accordingly, UPA candidate Meera Kumar will get the maximum 8932 votes from Punjab, while the NDA candidate is going to get around 2018 votes
 haalanki abhi aam aadmi party or lok insaaf party ne apane pattey nahin khole hai, lekin yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki punjab main raashtrapati chunaav ke dauraan aam aadmi party or lok insaaf party kis ummidavaar ke saath jaaenge
 Till now both parties have opposed BJP and Congress
 vahiin, aam aadmi party ke netaa kanvar sandhu kaa kahana he ki unki party ko raashtrapati chunaav main apana ummidavaar utaarna chahie tha
 He said that the Punjab MLA of Aam Aadmi Party will vote in favor of which candidate, it will decide only the high command sitting in Arvind Kejriwal and his Delhi
 raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar haryana ke vidhayakon or saansadon kii bhoomika bhi kaaphi ahm hogi
 In Haryana, Congress and BJP will vote for their candidates, but lobbying has intensified from both parties to bring Haryana's main opposition party Indian National Lok Dal in favor of their candidate
 agar haryana ke aankadon par najar daalen, to haryana main 90 vidhayak hai
 Its vote value is 10,080
 iske alaava 10 loksabhaa or paanch rajyasabha ke sadsy hai, jinaki vot kii vailu 10,620 he
 Thus the total vote value of Haryana is 20,700
 philhal indian neshnal lokdal ne apane pattey nahin khole hai
 He has 18 mlas, an MP and two Rajya Sabha members, whose vote value is 4,140
 jis tarah ke rishte indian neshnal lokdal ke congress or haryana congress ke varisht netaa bhupendra singh hooda ke saath rahe hai
 Looking at him, there is little hope that the Indian National Lok Dal will vote in favor of UPA Presidential candidate Meera Kumar
 indian neshnal lokdal ne saaf kar diya he ki unke vidhayak or saansad kiske paksh main vot karenge, ye unki party ke supremeo om prakaash chautaala hi tay karenge or jo bhi naam om prakaash chautaala kii ore se dikalair kiya jayega, usee ke paksh main vidhayak or saansad apana vot daal denge
 On the other hand, the Congress has appealed to the mlas and mps of all the political parties of Punjab Haryana that UPA candidate Meira Kumar is a capable presidential candidate and everyone should vote behind politics in their favor
 haryana or punjab ke vidhayakon or saansadon ke vot is raashtrapati chunaav main kaaphi ahm rahane vaale hai or is baat kii jaankaree upie evam endie donon ke hi ummidavaaron ko he
 For this reason, the NDA candidates are spending a day in Chandigarh during their campaigning and are seeking votes from the opposing parties in their favor
 mana ja rahaa he ki aane vaale dinon main upie kii candidet mira kumaar bhi chandigarh aakar apane paksh main prachaar kar sakati hai
 If you watch the news on television, then you must be watching the scene of Yamuna
 yamuna kaa yauvan dekhne laayak he
 But the news is trying to frighten Delhi
 baadh kaa sankat bataaya ja rahaa he
 Is there an accident like flood in rivers? This is a very natural phenomenon
 har nadi main baadh aati he or aani bhi chahie
 Many people wonder why Delhi flooded even when it did not rain
 aisa kehane vaale log na to nadiyon ke swabhaav ko jaanate hai na nadi tantra ko
 People unaware of terms such as catchments and basins refer to the iron bridge over the Yamuna as the basis for the Yamuna's water to rise and fall
 dilli main rahane vaale yaa kabhi yamuna ko paar karne vaale log use rozaana dekhte honge, uske kaale gandhate pani par hai-hai karte honge
 You will never see clean water in Yamuna all over Delhi
 bas, dilli se pehle wazirabad baraj hi vah jagah he jahaan par yamuna kaa pani kaala nahin hota
 But there we stop almost all the water of Yamuna and the water we see before it is the sewer of Delhi
 udyogon or gharon kaa ganda pradooshit pani jo bina treetment ke sidhe usamen giraaya jaataa he
 The plight of the Yamuna river starts from Wazirabad
 dilli main wazirabad se okhla bairaj ke bich kii yah duuri, duniya main kisi bhi nadi kii tulana main yamuna ke liye sabase zyada chunauteepurn he
 Yamuna is the most polluted in this area
 aakhir yamuna ko yun hi vaigyanik jaivik registan nahin kehete
 It has an embarrassing status of India's most polluted river
 iske pani main nitrogen, potacium, phosphorus or biomides jaise krishi rasayan kii maujuudagi main pichley 25 varshon main chaar guna vruddhi hui he
 Dehradun, Yamuna Nagar, Karnal, Sonipat, Panipat, Delhi, Faridabad, Vallabhgarh, Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Noida, Mathura and Agra dump household and industrial waste directly into the Yamuna
 anumaan he ki haryana ke 22, dilli kii 42 or uttar pradesh kii 17 factoriyaan yamuna main sidhe taral kachra bahaati hai
 Yamuna shrinks to one and a half to three kilometers wide by coming to this part
 yamuna par kiye gaye kai shodhon main se ek shodh kahata he ki garamiyon main isaki gaharaai bhi kariban ek meter or chaudaai mahaj 80 meter rah jaati he
 Right now, seeing the stream you are being threatened with flood, in summer, the Yamuna remains just 16 percent
 yamuna ko dilli ne maut di he or usamen bhi sabase adhik chunauti sarkari agenciyon se mili he
 Shastri Park Metro on 100 acres, Yamuna Khadar ITO Metro on 100 acres, Khelgaon and other connected construction on 100 acres, Indrapastha bus depot on 61 acres and Akshardham on 100 acres
 nagar nigam ke naalon ne yamuna kaa anchal rojaanaa mailaa karne kaa theka liya hua he so alag
 Mehrauli, the adjoining strip from Vasant Vihar to Dwarka, Haryana, traverses throughout the year
 yahi vah hissaa he, jisane 1947 se 2010 ke bich nau baadh dekhe hai
 1947, 1964, 1977, 1978, 1988, 1995, 1998, 2008 and 2010
 yamuna ke pete main dhadadhad nirmaan kiye ja rahe hai
 Forgetting that the Yamuna flows in the fault line and whenever the earthquake strikes, it will remain chic
 kendriya jal ayog kaa prastaav kahata he ki yamuna dhara ke madhya bindu or ekataraf ke pushte ke bich kii duuri kam-se-kam paanch kimi rahani chahie
 But the reality is that all the constructions like Metro, Khelgaon, Akshardham have been built by compromising safety
 paryaavaran sangrakshan kanoon- 1986 kii manshaa ke mutabik, nadiyon ko ‘river regulation jone’ ke rup main adhishuchet kar surakshit kiya janaa chahie tha
 Despite the initiatives taken in 2001–2002, the Ministry of the Environment has proved unable to do so till date
 baadh kshetra ko ‘ground water centuri’ ghoshit karne ke kendriya bhoojal ayog ke prastaav ko ham kahaan lagu kar sake?yamuna jahaan abhi bah rahi he, yah usee kaa rasta he
 We have been afraid to see the booming water because we have illegally settled our house in its belt

 Input from IANS ieenes se input Looking at the Gujarat election results in totality, if you want to tell in one line, then you will say that the Congress lost and the BJP survived
 congress ne vikaas ke alaava notebandi or jiesti ko mudda banaaya
 The issue of GST is not over despite BJP winning Gujarat
 congress agar gujarat jeet jaati to jeet ke alaava uske paas pradhanmantri modi ko unke griharajya main haraane kaa gaurav bhi hota
 The battle for this reputation made the BJP restless and campaigned strongly in the last phase
 parinaamon se donon hi partiyaan soch-vichaar or bechaini ke agle charan main pahunch gai hai
 Now the challenge before the Congress is to save Karnataka, the main province in power
 sabase pehle baat jiesti kii
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has managed to reduce the resentment of the traders of Gujarat to a certain extent on the GST, but the next truth is that the government has not yet tightened the GST
 kar vasuuli kaa dabaav jab banegaa tab vyapaariyon kii asli naaraazgi saamne aegi
 Right now there are many difficulties in following GST which are being overcome
 jab niyamanusaar jiesti lagu hoga tab kaarobaariyon par dabaav badhegaa
 Also, when the e-waybill system will be implemented in the entire country from June next year, the difficulties will increase because even today the inspectors of dozens of truckers on the border of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have a tip over the weight of the goods
 dilli main bhi is par vivaad roj saamne aa rahe hai
 This is delaying delivery of goods
 aise main mumkin he ki sarkaar jiesti kii samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke taur par par riyaayaton kaa nayaa pitara bhi saamne le aae kyonki uske saamne 2019 ke chunaav kii taiyaari bhi he
 The Congress will also have to clear the situation on how it will give relief on GST and to what extent it agreed to this GST
 bhaajapa ke saamne duusari or sabase badi chunauti berogari se nipatane kii he
 Unemployment was the root cause of the Patel problem in Gujarat
 jidipi, vikaas or berogari darasal judi hui chijen hai
 Without presenting a solution to these, both the BJP and the Congress will not cross
 congress ke saamne dohari chunauti isliye he kyonki use centre sarkaar kii naakaamiyon ke saath maujuuda samasyaon kaa samaadhaan pesh karnaa hoga jo ki usne gujarat chunaav main bahut thodaa pesh kiya
 In Gujarat, the Congress did not present a concrete solution to any issue of the problem of cotton farmers
 iskaa ek subut ye he ki bhaajapa ke netaa bhi dabi jubaan se kah rahe hai ki paas (patidaar andolan) ne nahin kapaas ne bhaajapa ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 Both the BJP and the Congress have gained energy from the Gujarat elections
 congress ko rahul gandhi ke rup main ab ek acha prachaarak (pichley loksabhaa chunaav main unhen bura prachaarak mana jaataa tha) mila he
 The BJP is now preparing to win Karnataka by winning Gujarat and Himachal
 vahaan use na kisi patidaar netaa or na hi kisi anti inakambinsee factor kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 But for the Congress, saving Karnataka will be a question of the same level of prestige as saving Gujarat for the BJP
 agar congress ke haath se karnataka nikalegaa to rahul gandhi ke netritv par sawaal uthenge
 However, one thing came out clearly from the Gujarat election results and enthusiasts that the issues related to GST and economy will remain at the center till the 2019 general election
 isamen mahangaai or berogari silent killer kii bhoomika nibhaayenge
 How political parties will deal with these problems will determine their future

 film 'maai nem ij khan' par badhate bavaal ke bich shahrukh khan ne kaha he ki agar unki baton se kisi ko thes pahunchi he, to iskaa unhen khed he
 He has written a message on 'twitter' that he is sorry to offend someone, knowingly or unknowingly
 unhone samarthakon se kaha he ki ve mumbai or apane desh se bahut pyaar karte hai
 Significantly, 'my Name is Khan' has been released in many parts of the country including Mumbai, but Shiv Sainiks are constantly trying to disrupt the performance of the film

 kehane ko hurriyat conference ke netaa masarrat alam kii rihaai ko lekar uthaa vivaad kuch palon ke liye bhale hi tham gaya ho, par khabar he ki jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri mufti mohammad ke algavaavadiyon or aatankiyon ke rihaai ke liye bade kadam rukenge nahin
 On this, opposition parties tried to surround the Mufti, along with the BJP, from Parliament to Jammu and Kashmir, but they did not panic at all
 vajah he, is par pidipi ko kashmir main mila logon kaa bharpoor samarthan, jisase ghati main uski zaden or majboot hui he
 BJP has also got the opportunity to form a government in the princely state for the first time, so it too will think a hundred times before toppling the government
 aaj jo kuch bhi mufti kar rahe hai, thik 2002 main bhi vaisaa hi kar chuke hai
 The only difference is Congress was with PDP at that time and today is BJP
 tab pehle congress ne ankhen dikhaai thi or baad main hathiyaar daal die the
 PDP seems clear, history will be repeated again
 tabhi to apni sochi samajhi ranneeti ke tahat ab aatankiyon or raajnneetik kaidiyon ke rihaai kaa masalaa jaanch samiti ke hawaale kar diya gaya he
 However, the Home Ministry has kept the mufti with itself as last time so that it can take decisions according to its own mind
 jaanch samiti kuch bhi faisla kare rihaai par antim muhar to grih mantralay hi lagaataa he
 The Muftis have also decided that they want to send a message to the Kashmiris that they can take any decision in the interest of the people even if their government runs
 vaise kashmir main 1990 se lekar 2001 tak aankadon par najar daalen to pataa chalegaa ki 12 saalon main 52 hajaar aatankiyon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 Of these 52 thousand terrorists, 25 thousand were released only after initial investigation
 baaki bache 27 hajaar ko tada or duusare anya kanoonon ke mutabik giraftaar kiya gaya tha unamem se kareeb paanch hajaar ko to dhara 169 ke tahat reeha kar diya gaya
 Almost the same number of terrorists were released on bail
 10 hajaar se adhik aatankiyon ko kai jaanch samitiyon or rajya sarkaar ne chhod diya
 It is true that during the tenure of the National Conference except Mufti, such terrorists and separatists have been left, but during the first term of the Mufti government, the way terrorists have been released in the name of political prisoners in the name of Healing Touch, It is difficult to believe that the muftis have calmed down after the BJP refuses

 supreme court main oktober 2016 se sitambar 2017 ke bich main kul 61,520 mukademe darj hue
 Had the printing on both sides been used to record these cases, 2,953 trees and 24,600 tankers of water (1,000 liters in a tanker) would have been saved
 yah akalan nai dilli sthit think tanks centre for acountbility and systemic change (sieessi) ne kiya
 On September 5, 2018, CASC filed a PIL with this assessment, asking the court for directions on printing on both sides of the paper
 india spend ke mutabik isse pehle 8 agast, 2018 ko bhi sieessi ne janhit yachika daayar karte hue apana akalan court ke saamne rakhte hue kaha ki yadi court yachika main istemaal kaagaj ke donon taraf print kii anumati de to puure desh kii badi-choti adaalaton main kaagaj kii bachat ke jariye 27,000 ped or 2,000 million litre pani ko prati maheene bachaaya ja saktaa he
 In order to save the paper that is being used in court proceedings in public interest litigation, it has also been suggested that in the present time, the court petition has the criteria of using wide margin with double space typing
 vahiin line spacing (do linon ke bich jagah) ke liye court kaa nirdesh he ki 2 kii jagah yadi 1
 If reduced to 5, 25 percent of the paper used in the court will be saved
 vahiin maujuuda samay main istemaal ho rahe font sies ko bhi kam karne se kam se kam 30 fisadi kaagaj kii bachat kii ja sakati he
 It is worth mentioning that the practice of typing one side of the paper on the court and court has been going on since the time of the type writer
 vahiin line spacing samet bade font kaa istemaal isliye kiya jaataa tha ki draft main truti paae jane par likhi gai line ke upar sanshodhan kiya ja sake
 According to an expert, 8,333 paper sheets are produced from a tree
 in shits ko taiyaar karne main lagbhag 10 litre pani kaa istemaal hota he
 Therefore, if there are only two parties to the 61,520 cases in the court, then 8 copies of the petition are required
 chaar kaa istemaal court ke liye hota he or ek-ek copy donon pakshon or unke vakeelon ke liye jaruri he
 49 if all the petitions are at least 100 pages
 2 million kii jarurat padegi
 It is clear that 49
 2 million kaagaj kii shit taiyaar karne main 5,906 pedo ko kaatane kii jarurat padegi
 So, if printing on both sides of the paper is approved, directly 2,953 trees and 246 million liters of water can be saved
 gauratlab he kisupreme courtmen paper ko bachaane kii pahal 2013 se chal rahi he
 Earlier in February 2015, the Supreme Court took two major initiatives to save the environment
 pehla, court ke faisle kii printed kaapiyon kii sankhya ghatai
 Only a maximum of 14, 16 or 18 copies of any verdict are printed, in such a case when the judge says that the printing of the judgment of the court is necessary
 isi samay praavdhaan kiya gaya tha ki jaj or vakil court kii website se faisle ko downlod kar apana kaam karenge

 babul supriyo ne aage kaha ki isi 'sarkaar' film main ek dialog he jisamen ek shaks kahata he- sarkaar ko maarane ke liye uski soch ko maarna jaruri he
 He further explained that they are trying to kill this dirty thinking, because in their thinking there is neither Raj Dharma nor Human Religion

 65-year-old Hajir Khan and his son Maulvi Khurshid were offering namaz inside the mosque in a small town called Gopalgarh, 90 km from Bharatpur in Rajasthan

 There were armed policemen together
 khan kehete hai, ''goliyon kii bauchhaar ne masjid ko chalni kar diya
 a bullet pierced my son's face
 main apni jaan bachaane ke liye jhuk gaya
 "after a brief rest, the armored carriage went back, but the guns roared again
 do din baad khan ko apane bete kii laash bharatpur ke aspataal ke murdaghar main mili
 The body was burnt to death
 uske haath-pair gaayab the
 Khan was told that the corpse was found in the well of Idgah, two hundred yards away from the mosque on the evening of 15 September along with two more dead bodies
 bete kii pahchaan daanton kii diene jaanch se hui
 He says that the part of the face in which the bullet took place was cut, probably so that no evidence could be found
 lekin india today ke paas maujuud postmortem report ke mutabik teenon ko jinda jalaayaa gaya tha
 Five more people died on that ill-fated day and all five were from the local Muslim Meo community
 unki laashen yaa to jali hui thim yaa un par goliyon or jalane ke nishaan the
 Two people died later in the hospital
 haadase kii jaanch ko kareeb do saal ho chuke hai
 Sources say that the charge sheet that CBI is going to file in October, the violence is expected to be completely blown away by the mob of Hindu Gurjars and Meo Muslim communities
 vahiin, aaropon se ghiri police or rajya sarkaar ko nirdosh sabit kar diya jayega
 In this case, the Rajasthan police was accused of using unaccounted force, the Ashok Gehlot government of the state also ignored the intelligence warning received from the Bharatpur administration about the communal clash
 gopalgarh bhale hi haryana tak faile mev prabhaav vaale kshetra kaa hissaa ho, lekin is kasbe main gurjaron kii taadaad zyada he
 Prior to the bloody game on 14 September 2011, there had been several skirmishes between the two cattle ranchers
 vivaad kii jad do acre kii sarkari jameen thi, jise kisi ko transfar nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The land next to the mosque was transferred by the Meo Muslims as a cemetery, yet the Gujjars continued to feed their cattle on it until July 2011
 donon paksh adaalat main gaye or 13 sitambar ko sunwaayee ke samay aapas main bhid gaye
 The same evening, a Gurjar boy was beaten up in the charge of harassing the girl at the cellphone shop of Abdul Ghani, the mosque's caretaker
 kuch hi ghanton baad gurjaron ke ladakon ne abdul gani, unke do beton or vahaan se guzar rahe masjid ke imam maulavee rashid kii pitayee kar di
 It is said that by nightfall, loudspeakers from local mosques spread rumors of the two fighting with rumors that the Imam's hands and feet had been cut off
 sibiai kii chargeshit main saboot ke taur par masjid se kii gai ghoshnaaon or saath hi badla lene ke liye logon ko uksaae jane kaa police record shaamil kiya ja rahaa he
 By the afternoon of 14 September, Meo and Gurjar started firing into the air with indigenous potters to threaten each other
 tab bharatpur ke jila colector krishna kunal or police adheekshak hinglaj daan ne donon samudaayon ke netaaon ko bulaakar sulah karai or gurjaron par dabaav daalaa ki shaam chaar baje tak imam se maafee maangen
 The reconciliation quickly broke
 police or sibiai donon is baat par ade hai ki maulavee rashid or gani ne mev musalamaanon ko sulah naamanzoor karne ke liye uksaaya
 The armed mob started marching towards the mosque and set fire to the Gurjars shops on the way
 jaipur main sibiai adaalat main pesh dastavejon se pataa chalata he ki usee samay kuch hindu, jinamein zyaadaatar gurjar the, police ke paas gaye or aarope lagaaya ki mev musalmaan un par hamale kar rahe hai
 By evening the police car which stopped the riot reached the mosque
 usamen bharatpur ke jila colector or police adheekshak sahit varisht police adhikari maujuud the
 They were followed by armed policemen
 un par firing hui or colector ke juute par ek chharra bhi laga
 But the Meo Muslims call this statement incorrect
 unhone india today ko bataaya ki sulah hone ke baad sau se bhi kam musalmaan masjid main namaaj adaa kar rahe the or baaki bhi namaaj padhgaye ke vaaste hi masjid kii ore bad rahe the
 The second round of firing occurred around five o'clock in the evening after the first shower of police bullets
 police sutron ke mutabik, zyaadaatar hathiyaarband mev musalmaan pehle round kii firing ke baad hi masjid se bhaag gaye or sirf nihathe log batch gaye
 If sources are to be believed, the CBI in its charge sheet is also claiming that the Meo Muslims had not gathered there for the Namaz
 shaam 6 baje ke kareeb gurjaron kii bheed masjid main ghusi or mev musalamaanon ko maar daalaa
 It is likely that the Gujjars crowd is to blame for the seven deaths in the CBI charge sheet, and it is said that the remaining three murders would have been 'probably' committed by the mob itself
 isse police ko andeh kaa laabh mil jayega
 On the other hand, on the day of the incident, the police opened fire for about 20 minutes
 sibiai or police ne ab tak sirf ek deshi bandook baraamad kii he or beshak usase to itane logon ko nahin maaraa ja saktaa tha
 These killings rocked both the Gehlot government and the Congress in the state
 24 sitambar ko mukhyamantri gopalgarh gaye or aanan-fanan main sibiai jaanch ke saath-saath rajasthan hycourt ke ritred jaj justise sunil kumaar garg se nyaayik jaanch karaane kaa aadesh de diya
 The local Superintendent of Police and Collector were also transferred
 sibiai ne adhikariyon ke khilaaf darj 11 maamalon kii jaanch karne se is aadhaar par manaa kar diya ki goli chalaane kaa aadesh kanoon or vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liye diya gaya tha
 Perhaps the judicial commission will decide whether the police firing was justified
 sibiai ke adhikariyon ne 43 faraar sandigdhon ke liye gopalgarh or aasapaas ke gaanvon kaa chappa-chappa chaan maaraa
 19 others including Gani were arrested
 sthaneey congress vidhayak jaahida khan or bijepi kii anita singh ko sitambar 2013 ke shuru main hi agrim jamaanat mil gai
 However, the CBI was seeking arrest on both of them on charges of obstructing police work and inciting the mob
 donon kaa daawa he ki sthaneey adhikariyon ne sthiti shant karne ke liye unhen bulaayaa tha
 Maulvi Rashid has gone underground after being accused of treason in August
 purv saansad or bharatpur kii purv riyasat ke vaaris, congress ke vishvendra singh kaa kahana he ki mev or gurjar, donon sibiai ke chhaapon se dare hue or gusse main hai
 The BJP organized bandhs in protest against raids across the district to cash in on dissatisfaction
 sibiai se milane vaali clin chit kii ummid main hi shaayad mukhyamantri ne haal main kaha tha ki unke shasankaal main kabhi kisi par lathicharge nahin hua
 On this, bjp's Vasundhara Raje questioned that if the government did not fire, how did people die in Gopalgarh? It is possible that the clean chit of the CBI may overshadow Gehlot's electoral arithmetic
 acchhee neend swasth rahane or bimariyon se dur rakhane main madad karti he
 Good and sound sleep is as important for health as exercise and physical activity
 vaise to sabhi sote hai lekin kuch logon ko neend bahut kam aati he
 Even if they come, they sleep in a short period of time
 jis vajah se wo thakaan, sar dard, mood swing jaisi bimariyon ko shikaar hone lagate hai
 But today we are telling you how to sleep well
 1
 Keep your mind free: At bedtime, remove all kinds of things from your mind
 zyada sochna, tension lenaa,kai chizon kii phikr main lage rahanaa, aapako neend se dur rakhata he
 Take a long breath while sleeping and keep yourself relaxed
 2
 Listen to music: If you cannot sleep, listen to the soft music of your choice while sleeping
 isse aapke dimag ko shanti kaa ehsaas hoga
 So that you will get a good sleep easily
 3
 The most important role in keeping the mobile closed is the mobile phone
 aajkal kii lifestil main log mobile or internet ke aadi ho gaye hai
 Staying on mobile till late night, being active on social sites, affects our mind due to which we are unable to sleep properly
 isliye sone se pehle apane mobile ko yaa to band kar den yaa silent par laga den
 4
 pareshaan kar dene vaale tivi program naa dekhen:sote samay hameshaa detective yaa horer program dekhne se bachein
 Watching such programs takes care in your mind right there
 jis kaaran aapaki neend baar-baar khulti rahati he or aap thik se so nahin pate
 5
 positive soch rakhen:acchhee neend ke liye jaruri he ki aapkaa dimag bilkul shant ho
 For this, it is important to forget your tension and always think positive
 aap sabase best hai, aapkaa jivan khushiyon se bharaa hua he, koi cheez aapke liye mushkil nahin hai
 Thinking such things will relax you, you will sleep well

 Rio is nearing the Olympic finals and China is deeply saddened by its worst performance in the last 20 years which has pushed it to the third spot after the US and Britain in the medal table, raising questions over the impact of its state sponsor game system Huh

 When the Narendra Modi government is trying to provide LPG connections to India's poorest families, agricultural scientists in West Bengal have revived a traditional grain that does not have to be cooked
 pichley dashak ke dauraan phulia (jila nadia) main krishi prashikshan santhaan main ugaai gai—komaldhan kii ek swadeshi nasl he, is chaaval ko koi 30 minute bhigone ke baad khaaya ja saktaa he
 Anupam Paul, assistant director at the institute, who has been instrumental in bringing back 430 other indigenous varieties of paddy, including komal, says it (komal) is a high-yielding variety that is 4 to 4 per hectare
 5 ton kii paidaavaar detii he or atirikt laabh yah he ki ise kisi rasinic urvarak yaa kitnashkon kii jarurat nahin hoti
 After soaking it can be eaten like normal rice and it is especially tasty with curd and jaggery
 krishi vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne apni field report main kaha he ki kai adivasee parivaar, jinhen sarkaar se 2 rupye prati kilo kii dar se chaaval praapt hota he, ve sabsidi vaala anaaj bechney ke liye majaboor hue hai kyonki ve khaanaa pakaane ke liye mahangaa eendhan nahin kharid sakate
 He says that "gentle will be a boon for people in backward and tribal areas"
 ''apni tamaam khoobiyon ke baavjood, yah bhi ki ise pakaane kii jarurat nahin hoti, komal ko rajya sarkaar ne kisi tarah se kabhi badhaava nahin diya
 Officials of the State Agriculture Department have blamed the 'chemical Fertilizer Lobby' for this, which is against traditional cereals that can be grown without artificial fertilizers
 ek adhikari bataate hai, ''in swadeshi anaajon ko jaivik khaad kii jarurat hoti he
 "many believe that this was the lobby behind the removal of Agriculture Minister Purnendu Bose from the chair of organic farming
 bose ko 44 lakh hectare krishi bhoomi main se ek lakh hectare bhoomi ko jaivik kheti ke tahat laane kaa shrey jaataa he
 Bose, who was abruptly removed from the Department of Agriculture, was reassigned to the Technical Education Department of relatively little importance on 6 September
 kolkata main yah charchaa he ki bose ke rajya ke krishi salaahkaar pi
 There were deep differences with Mazumdar
 majumdaar ke urvarak lobby se ghanishtha sambandh hai
 The current Agriculture Minister Ashish Banerjee has promised to promote Komal
 swadeshi naslon ko badhaava dene ke prati rajya sarkaar kii anichhaa kisaanon or paryaavaran donon ko mahangi padati he
 Consider: The cost of cultivation of Komal is initially around Rs 35,000
 prati hectare hoti he, lekin chauthe varsh main (jaivik khaad sookshm poshak tatwon ko badhaati he or fasal kii paidaavaar main vruddhi kar detii he) yah 27,000 ru
 Per hectare remains
 jaivik khaad kaa lagaataar upyog mitti kii urvartaa badhaata he
 In comparison the cost of growing new hybrid paddy varieties (which is Rs
 36,000)
 se 40,000 ru
 Per hectare) increases continuously because the soil ecosystem is ruined by the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides
 paul or unke sahyogiyon kaa kahana he ki is varsh kisaanon ne 60 ton kalabhaat kii swadeshi nasl kii kheti kii he
 Kalabhata is known for its anti-cancer medicinal properties and is rich in iron
 isko apana bazaar milegaa
 But varieties like Komal, a boon for the poor, will need support from the government

 'nakash', the third film by young director Syed Jagam Imam, who left journalism and entered the world of films, is based on the life and social struggles of Muslim craftsmen of Benares and Uttar Pradesh who carve in temples

 com / 20srqpkxet— Cathay Pacific (@cathaypacific)september 19, 2018galat ssailing par cathe pacific ne apni galati to maan lee lekin abhi yah saaf nahin ho paaya he ki aisa hua kaise
 a company spokesperson told CNN that there should be no discussion on this, so the incident is being shared with everyone
 cathe pacific kaa naam duniya kii top companiyon main ek he
 The company has been awarded the Skytrax World Airline Award for the year 2018
 ek samay desh main iodine namak kaa istemaal badhaane ko lekar tivi par sarkari vibhaag or nijee companiyon donon hi ore se jamkar vigyaapan prasaarit kiye jate the
 Then the demand for iodine increased and increasingly this salt became a part of people's kitchens
 lekin pichley dinon america kii ek research main daawa kiya gaya ki bharat main beche jane vaale iodine namak main ek khatarnaak chemical mila hua he jo logon ko napusank bana saktaa he balki isamen cancer paidaa karne kii kshamta bhi he
 The report also claimed that the chemical used in iodine salt is also vulnerable to many other serious diseases
 godhum grence and sans farm ke chairman shiv shankar gupta ke anusaar america kii west analitical leboratries (WAL) ne bharat kii kai branded companiyon ke namak kii jaanch kii
 In the investigation, a chemical named potassium ferrocyanide was found in the salt
 ye chemical carcinogenic hota he
 Carcinogenic ie the element that is helpful in causing cancer in the body
 iskaa arth yah hua ki iodine namak ke istemaal se cancer bhi ho saktaa he
 a sample of Tata salt has been sent for testing by the government in Jammu and Kashmir when it comes to the use of hazardous chemical in iodine salt
 cancer paidaa karne main sakshamwest analitical leboratries kii research main yah khulaasa kiya gaya ki ek kilo namak main 1
 90 to 4
 91 milligram tak potacium pherocynad mila hota he or yah cancer paidaa karne ke liye paryaapt he
 56 countries including the US and Germany have banned the use of potassium ferrocyanide in salt, while in India it is used to process salt
 america kii research company bharat se is masale par baat karne ke liye lagaataar sampark saadh rahi he, lekin ab bhi koi respons nahin mila
 Bleaching leads to salt White companies making salt in India use a dangerous process like bleaching
 bleaching ke prayog se namak safed dikhne lagata he
 During the process of cleaning the salt, iodine and potassium ferrocyanide are added to it
 is prakriya ko rifind kaha jaataa he, lekin isse namak main maujuud neutrients khatm ho jate hai
 The special thing is that iodine is naturally present in salt
 kitna khatarnaak chemicalarifind namak logon ko napusank bana saktaa he
 Apart from this, it can cause serious problems like high blood pressure, kidney failure problem and obesity
 potacium pherocynide itnaa khatarnaak hota he ki agar ise lab se lekar kha liya jaae to antadiyaan tak kharaab ho sakati hai
 With just a touch, hands can swell and blisters can occur on them
 galati se soongh lene se saans sambandhi dikkat ho sakati he
 At the same time, if this chemical accidentally went in the eye, then the man can also become blind
 godhum grence and sans farm ke chairman shiv shankar gupta lambey samay se jahrile namak ke khilaaf pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Shiva Shankar Gupta, 91, says that the use of this dangerous chemical in salt is not allowed
 lekin companiyaan iskaa dhadlle se istemaal kar raheen hai
 Big companies pack this waste called potassium and transport it to the people
 log bina kisi shikaayat ke ise istemaal karte hai kyonki unhen isaki sachai ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin he
 Tata Salt scavenger Shankar Gupta also filed an RTI for an in-depth investigation into the matter in which it was found that FSSAI had never investigated any branded salt
 phir bhi iodine yukt namak saream bazaar main bik rahaa he
 Tata Salt has also given its reply in this regard
 uskaa kahana he ki company kaa namak khaane ke liye surakshit he
 No such chemical has been found in him
 'desh kaa namak' kehalaae jane vaala tata apane namak main chemical ke daavon ko nakaar rahaa he

 film : rangoondiarector: vishaal bharadwajastar cast: kangana ranot, shahid kapur, saf ali khaivadhi: 2 ghanta 46 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 2
 5 Movies like Omkara, Maqbool, Haider, Kaminey are remembered as soon as the name of Starvishala Bharadwaj comes
 wiliam shakespeare kii rachanaaon par aadhaarit kai filmein vishaal ne diarect kii hai
 Just after the release of 'omkara' in 2006, Vishal planned to direct 'rangoon'
 lekin kinhi kaarnon se wo ho nahin paaya
 Now 'rangoon' has come out after about 11 years
 iskaa screenple mathew robins ne hi likhaa he jinhone vishaal kii film '7 khun maaf' par bhi kaam kiya tha
 Kangana became 'hunterwali', will be released on giving 2 crores 'rangoon' but find out what Vishal Bhardwaj has been able to show this story of 1940s in his own style: this is the story of the film During the war (1939 –1945)
 us samay british sena kii bharat par hukumat thi or bharat -burma kii sarhad ke paas ke jangalon main english or bharat kii sena kaa manoranjan miss julia (kangana ranot) karti hai
 Julia's life also has a different story of how she became Julia from Jwala Devi
 julia kaa film produsar rustam billymoriya urf rusi (saf ali khan) se afyer hota he, or julia kii khwaahish misses billymoriya bananaa he
 At the behest of Major General Harding (richard mccabe), Julia is sent to entertain soldiers on the Burma border
 isi dauraan uski mulaakaat jamaadaar nawab malik (shahid kapur) ke saath hoti he or paristhitiyaan aisi ho jaati hai ki julia or nawab main ek alag tarah kaa pyaar ho jaataa he
 In the story, on the one hand, Nawab Malik of the Indian Army (who came under the British) in World War wants to do something different, while Julia's share is shown
 relies se pehle 'rangoon' main kate 70 seen, 13 minute ghati film kii lambaaikyon dekh sakate hai film- world war 2 ke dauraan hone vaali ghatnaon ko ek story ke tahat vishaal bharadwaj ne bataane kii koshish kii he jo shaayad aapako itihaas ke pannon kii taraf khinch kar le jaati he
 Good research has been done on the film
 - film ko 40 ke dashak ke hisaab se hi rakhaa gaya he jisaki vajah se research work or ek-ek cheez ko usee lihaaj se parosane kii koshish kii gai
 This has increased the visibility of the film
 - kangana ranot kii ek baar phir se kaaphi saraahna kii ja sakati he, unhone bahut hi umdaa abhinay kiya he
 British actor Richard mccabe is the finest in the role of Major General
 saf or shahid ne bhi shandaar abhinay kiya he
 - Pankaj Kumar's cinematography in the film and especially the filming near the border is amazing
 kamjor kadiyaan- film kii kamjor kadi isaki length he, jo first half main to bahut sateek he, lekin interval ke baad kaaphi khinchi lagati he
 However, editing could be improved even further
 - film ke gane or becoground score, kahani ke saath-saath chalate hai or raftaar banaae rakhte hai
 Interstitial songs also look good
 lekin koi yaadgaar nahin he
 - There is romance in the film, but there are no emotions
 - film kaa climex kaaphi alag darshane kii koshish kii gai he
 It definitely gives you a huge flavored feel but the climax feels quite stretched
 isaki sharp editing bahut jaruri thi
 - The film has gone astray in an attempt to show the world war, Azad Hind Fauj, British rule, romance, deception, patriotism - all at the same time
 tab hogi film hitengoon kaa bajet 75-80 karod ke bich bataaya ja rahaa he
 However, its promotion cost is not high
 film ko 3000 screens main relies kiye jane kii khabar he jisamen se 60% metro cities or 40% single theatre or maas ke liye rakhaa gaya he
 Also, Overseas has a count of 500 screens
 agar film 80 karod se kam kaa bijness karegi to flop rahagi
 To be a hit, the film would have to do a business of at least 110 crores
 kangana ne australian actor ko kiya copy? 'rangoon' par kesahaalanki vaise khabaron ke mutabik, film pehle din 9-10 karod kii opening ke saath relies ho sakati he

 com / tah4alanmh— ITBP (@itbp_official)december 28, 2017aapako bataa den ki siachin main thand main taapmaana shunya se 50 degree celsius tak neeche pahunch jaataa he
 India's outpost from Siachen base camp is Indra Call and it takes about 20 to 22 days for the soldiers to walk there
 achaanak badale mausam se puure uttar bharat main thand bad gai he
 Jammu and Kashmir is also experiencing heavy snowfall
 aapako bataa den ki abhi haal hi main kuch dinon pehle gurej sector main himaskhalan ke kaaran 5 jawan gaayab ho gaye the
 The body of 3 jawans was later recovered
 isse pehle bhi 2017 kii shuruyaat main gurej sector main himaskhalan ke kaaran 15 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 The jawans had been missing for several days in Gurez due to the avalanche, but later the bodies of 15 soldiers were found
 taapmaana main giravat se ai pareshanighati ke adhiktar ilaakon main raat kaa taapmaana shunya se 2 se 10 degree tak neeche chalaa gaya tha
 Due to this, the water resources froze and people also had problems in finding drinking water
 kai ilaako main logon ko is kadakadaati thand main pani len ke liye kaaphi dur janaa pada
 The BJP has accused the Delhi government of not being serious about the water problem in the murder of an elderly man in the national capital on Saturday in the Wazirpur area
 dilli vidhansabha main netaa pratipakshavijendra guptane bataaya ki vajirpur industrial aria main pani ke liye peet-petakar kii gaibujurg kii hatyadilli ke liye khatarnaak sanket he
 Gupta has asked CM Kejriwal that how will he arrange drinking water for the entire Delhi in the summer? Vijender Gupta has asked the government to issue a white paper about the water situation in Delhi

 The BJP leader said, Delhi's total requirement is 1100 MGD of water, but the total capacity of all the water treatment plants of Delhi Jal Board to clean the water is 800 MGD
 vahiin baar mashine kharaab hone ke kaaran water treetment plant kai baar kshamta ke mutabik pani saaf nahin kar pate
 Gupta alleged that the water mafia fiercely steals water from the water supplied from the pipeline
 jin ilaakon main pipeline se pani kii aapurti nahin hoti, vahaan tankeron ke jariye pani kii supplai to hoti he
 But the tanker water is sold elsewhere
 netaa pratipaksh ke mutabik pani chori kii jaankaree sarkaar ko bhi he, lekin usne ise rokane ke liye koi thos yojana nahin banaai he or yahi kaaran he ki pani ke liye ab hatyaein hona shuru ho gai hai
 Vijendra Gupta expressed the apprehension that the law and order problem may arise in the capital if this process progresses
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki munak nahar ke zarie haryana se milane vaala pani licage ke chalate zyaadaatar bah jaataa he, lekin munak nahar ko licage rahit banane ke liye bhi dilli sarkaar ne koi thos yojana nahin banaai he
 Let me tell you that 60-year-old Lal Bahadur was killed on Saturday for taking water from a tanker in Delhi's Wazirpur area

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Aam Aadmi Party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh has written a letter to the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha against the central government on the Rafale issue
 singh ne is patr main atorni general ko sansad main bulaae jane kii maang kii he taaki unase is puure maamle main safai maangi jaae
 The AAP MP said that in the Rafale case, the government has tried to mislead not only the Parliament but also the Supreme Court

 He said that the Center has kept the highest institutions in the dark
 singh ne kaha ki sadan main visheshadhikaar hanan prastaav laaunga
 Sanjay Singh said that the government is teaching grammar to the Supreme Court
 jab sieji kii koi jaanch report ai hi nahin to sarkaar ne supreme court se kaise kaha ki aisi koi jaanch report he
 The Attorney General of the government also told the Supreme Court that they had not read what was given in the sealed envelope, so how did they give the affidavit of correction? Where did they get that sealed report? The AAP MP said that the Supreme Court order mentions that the Air Force chief had objected to the disclosure of prices
 airforce chif ne yah bayaan kab diya yaa aisa koi affidavit kab diya tha? nae affidavit main bhi sarkaar kah rahi he ki sieji ko keemton ke bare main jaankaree de di gai he lekin sieji kii report to janvari ke baad aegi
 He said that according to the affidavit of the government, the Supreme Court considered that the CAG and PAC were already investigating the prices
 shaayad isi vajah se supreme court ne rafel ghotaale main jaanch ke aadesh nahin die
 If the court had known that no such investigation had taken place, then an inquiry would have been ordered in this case
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki hamane rajya sabha chairman ko chitthee likhakar maang kii he ki atarni general ko sansad main bulaayaa jaae or unase is puure maamle main safai maangi jaae
 The government has tried to mislead not only the Parliament but also the Supreme Court
 isse pehle rafel par supreme court ke faisle ke baad aap saansad sanjay singh ne maamle main jepisi jaanch kii maang kii
 He said that the government is never ready to believe that it has committed corruption

 In a press conference on Saturday, Sibal said that Sibal also said that in the Supreme Court, the government has given wrong information in the Rafale case
 ham chaahate hai ki piesi (lok lekha samiti) main atorni general ko bulaayaa janaa chahie, jisase yah saaf ho sake ki affidavit kyon jamaa karaae gaye, jiskaa vastav main koi zikr nahin he
 This is a very sensitive matter, which should also be discussed in Parliament
 unhone kaha ki congress is maamle main hameshaa spasht rahi he ki is maamle ke liye supreme court sahi jagah nahin he, yahaan par har tarah kii file kaa khulaasa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is also not under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
 unhone aage kaha ki supreme court ke har faisle main press report or sarkaar ke halafname kaa hawala diya gaya he
 The Supreme Court has also said in its order that they cannot decide due to the court's jurisdiction under Article 32
