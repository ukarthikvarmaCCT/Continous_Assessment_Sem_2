 There is a crack in the opposition coming together against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 samaajawaadee party (sapa) uttar pradesh main congress ke saath milakar chunaav ladane kii icchhuk nahin he
 According to sources close to SP National President Akhilesh Yadav, the party wants to give only two seats to the Congress out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 is babat gathbandhan ke duusare dalon se charchaa karne ke liye mangalvaar ko akhilesh yadav dilli pahunch rahe hai
 Sources say that in the Lok Sabha elections, the Samajwadi Party wants to give only Amethi and Rae Bareli seats to the Congress
 sapa isse ek bhi seat zyada congress ko nahin dena chaahati he
 In this regard, the SP is also planning to propose to the Congress
 sapa ke sutron kaa kahana he ki party upi main trikoniya muqabla chaahati he or mahagathbandhan main congress ko shaamil karne kii icchhuk nahin he
 According to Akhilesh Yadav Sutras to reach Delhi on Tuesday, on Tuesday, Akhilesh Yadav will go to Delhi and stay there for two to three days
 mana ja rahaa he ki is dauraan akhilesh yadav gathbandhan ke duusare netaaon se alag-alag mulaakaat karenge
 After staying in Delhi for two-three days, Akhilesh Yadav will go abroad for a holiday with the family
 unki yah dilli yatra gathbandhan ke lihaaj se ahm hogi
 The sp's representation was not in Rahul's iftar party and the news of a rift in SP came when neither Gandhi nor Akhilesh Yadav reached Rahul Gandhi's iftar party
 haalanki akhilesh yadav ne iftaar party main hissaa lene ke liye jor-shor se elaan bhi kiya tha
 Since then, there have been constant questions whether everything is not going well between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party? Questions are also arising whether SP National President Akhilesh Yadav will be given Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati and Congress Is not coming close? Is the former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav under pressure from the BSP for the seat sharing under the alliance
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav main karaari haar ke liye samaajawaadee party congress ko jimmedaar maanati he
 Hence, the Samajwadi Party is not in the mood to give much Congress a sense of humor in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin, upachunaavon main mili jeet ke baad se samaajawaadee party kisi bhi surat main bispi kaa saath nahin chhodana chaahati he
 Akhilesh Yadav has even announced that he is ready to become a junior partner for the alliance with the BSP and leave some seats
 mayawati ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar dabaav main hai akhileshbataya ja rahaa he ki in dinon espi adhyaksh akhilesh yadav basapa ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar khaase dabaav main hai
 However, while addressing the workers from Kannauj on Thursday, Akhilesh clearly said that the alliance will happen and will happen soon
 iftaar party main gaiyr-maujuudagi se shuru hua kayaason kaa daurabuudhvaar korahul gandhi kii iftaar party main samaajawaadee partike kisi numaayinde ke nahin pahunchane se kayaason kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 The way in which Mayawati and the Congress are constantly getting closer, it is probably not liking Akhilesh Yadav
 karnataka ke mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ke shapath grahan main jis tareeke se basapa or congress ke netaaon kii body language va chemistry dikhi or phir madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main bispi ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar congress kii gambhir charchaa hue, usko dekhte hue samaajawaadee party khud ko kinare mahasoos karne lagi he
 This is the reason why the Samajwadi Party has announced to contest all the seats in Madhya Pradesh
 upi main congress ke saath gathbandhan nahin chaahati sapaasmaajawaadee party uttar pradesh main congress ke saath gathbandhan nahin karnaa chaahati or uske netaa khulkar is baat kaa elaan bhi kar chuke hai
 Despite the Congress contesting the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections, the Samajwadi Party not only won the seats, but also forfeited the bail of the Congress
 aise main sapa ab upi main congress ke saath koi samjhauta nahin karnaa chaahati he
 On the other hand, Bahujan Samaj Party is constantly seen to be closely associated with Congress and this is the biggest headache for Samajwadi Party at the moment
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main basapa kaa nahin khulaa tha khataupi main kul 80 sansadeey siten he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP alliance won 73 seats in the Modi wave
 sapa ko paanch or congress ko do siten mili thi, jabaki basapa kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa tha
 Similarly, in the UP assembly elections held last year, the SP also managed to win more seats than the BSP
 haalanki in chunaavon main donon partiyaan alag-alag chunaav ladi thi
 After this, SP was supported by BSP in phulpur-gorakhpur by-election
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki bijepi ko karaari haar mili
 The relationship between the two parties has since strengthened
 yahi vajah he ki akhilesh yadav basapa kaa saath kisi bhi surat main chhodane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Mayawati is constantly under pressure
 Before the by-election, Mayawati had announced not to form an alliance for not getting respectable seats and then the way Akhilesh Yadav agreed to become a junior partner in Uttar Pradesh, since then it seemed that BSP Akhilesh Yadav is very angry about the alliance with the BJP, but Mayawati is currently keeping Akhilesh under constant pressure with his simple tricks
 kam siton kaa elaan sapa kaaryakartaaon ke gale nahin utrouttar pradesh ke siyaasi galiyaaron main is baat kii charchaa bahut tej he ki sapa or basapa gathbandhan ke bich sabakuch thik-thaak nahin he
 Mayawati does not want to contest less than 40 to 44 seats, while Akhilesh Yadav may agree to equal or 2-4 fewer seats, but the problem is not just the seats
 congress ke saath bhi ja sakati hai mayawativahin, congress philhal sadhi chaalon se uttar pradesh main mayawati ke saath apana bhavishya dekh rahi he
 In such a situation, the biggest concern of the Samajwadi Party is that Mayawati should not go with the Congress in the name of more seats
 isi ko bhaanpate hue akhilesh yadav ne chaar din pehle mainpuri main junior partner banane tak par apni sahmati de di thi
 On the one hand, the clean image of Akhilesh Yadav has been hit in the Bangla controversy, on the other hand, the proximity of Mayawati and Congress is also not good news for Akhilesh Yadav
 yahi vajah he ki apane tamaam pattey pehle kholane ke baad bhi akhilesh yadav par raajnneetik dabaav saaf dikhaai de rahaa he
 Assembly elections are due in four states of the country by the end of this year

 Homosexuality is a mental illness: Ramdev Prabhu Chawla, New Delhi "" In today's special show Sidhi Baat, India Today Editor and India Today Group Editorial Director Prabhu Chawla spoke with Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev
 baba ramdev ne samalangikta or deshbhakti jaise muddon ke saath hi vibhinn muddon par baat kii
 Significantly, after a decision given by the Delhi High Court regarding homosexuality in the past, the debate on this issue is going on in the country
 samalangikta pashutaa se bhi buribaba ramdev kaa kahana heki samalangikta ek maansik or anuvaanshik beemaari he
 When he was asked that it is his choice as to who he loves, then what is the problem with him
 to unhone kaha ki prem se takalif nahin, lekin prem or sex main antar he
 Baba Ramdev termed homosexuality as an absurdity and said that it is worse than animalism
 iske liye punarvaas centre hone chahie naa ki ise badhaava diya janaa chahie
 In many misconceptions about Jackson's habits, Baba called Michael Jackson stupid
 unhone kaha kimaaical ek kshetra main safal the lekin unki kai aadaten galat thim
 He said that the promotion of homosexuality would only lead to problems and a wrong tradition would begin
 unhone samalangita ko vivaah samskruti ke khilaaf bataaya or kaha ki yah ek sangathit sex aparaadh he
 The objective of the welfare of the society, he said that the biggest loss is loss of character, if the character is lost, everything is lost and homosexuality is the culmination of characterlessness
 jab unase poocha gaya ki aap kisi ke nijee jivan main dakhal kyon de rahe hai to unka kahana tha ki wo kisi ke nijee jivan main dakhal nahin de rahe balki samaaj ke kalyaan ke liye aisa kar rahe hai
 Our Marriage System Elsewhere, Baba Ramdev described India's marriage system as one of the best in the world and said that the promotion of homosexuality would crush this system
 unhone kaha ki desh main kai or samasyaayein hai jinaki ore dhyaan dene kii zyada jarurat he
 According to Baba, the safety of women is a big issue and not homosexuality in the country
 hamaare desh main badhati balaatkaar kii ghatnaon ko dekhte hue baba kaa kahana he ki balaatkaariyon, milawat karanevaale or duraachaariyon ke liye maut kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiya janaa chahie
 Desiring to rehabilitate homosexuals, he said that if homosexual people come to him for treatment, then they will build rehabilitation centers for them and will motivate them to do so
 baba kaa kahana he kismalangikta khun main hoti he isliye raktadan se samalangik logon ko dur rakhana chahie nahin to logon ke genes badal jaaenge
 He said that there is nothing greater than patriotism for him
 baba kaa sapana he ki wo bharat ke svarnim ateet ko phir se sthapit kar saken taaki bharat duniya main sabase badi shakti bane

 - input IANS There was uproar in Parliament on Tuesday against the remarks of members of bjp's youth wing against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, while Mamata Banerjee did not think it appropriate to give any direct response to this
 bataa den ki aligarh main bijepi ke youth wing ke netaa yogesh varshney ne kaha tha ki jo bhi mamata banerjee kaa sir kaat kar laaegaa use 11 lakh rupye kaa inaam diya jayega
 Varshney's statement came at a time when the case of lathicharge was in the headlines on a procession taken out on the occasion of Hanuman Jayanti in Birbhum, West Bengal
 bijepi kaa naam liye bina mamata ne kaha, 'mujhe kai tareekon se apshabd kahe jate hai lekin main is par dhyaan nahin detii
 It is like a blessing for me
 jitna wo mujhe gaaliyaan denge, utana hi zyada ham samrudh honge
 Mamta said, "I can only pray to the Almighty to forgive them, they don't know what they are doing
" unhen kisi tarah kii tavajjo dene kii jagah andekha karnaa chahie
 Mamta cautioned that basic dignity should be maintained in politics

 mamata ne kaha, 'agar wo sawaal karte hai ki main dargah yaa mandir kyon jaati hum to main hajaar baar vahaan jaaoongi
 He is the one who questions me
 'aise vakt main jab rashtriya swayan sevak sangh puure desh main govadh par pratibandh lagane kii maang kar rahaa he, tab mamata ne bijepi ko chetaya ki koun kya khaae or kya nahin, ye tay karne kaa adhikaar use nahin he

 ' gujarat chunaav main ab ram mandir mudde kii entry ho gai he
 First Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah questioned Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Ram temple issue, now Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also raised this issue in his rally
 modi ke bayaan par congress netaa anand sharma ne palatwaar kiya he
 He said that PM speaks bitter when he speaks
 anand sharma bole ki pradhanmantri jab bolte hai kadava hi bolte hai, gujarat ke khaane main bhi mithaas hoti he, par modi ji phir bhi kadava bolte hai
 He said that PM should tell what agenda they are contesting
 hamane unhen har mudde par dibet karne ke liye chanlej kiya he, chaahe to timming ve khud chun len
 Anand Sharma said that PM always gives the example of Gandhiji, but Gandhiji was a symbol of truth
 piem ko unke aadarshon kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 He said that the way the statements of BJP leaders are coming, it is clear that BJP is losing the election
 ram mandir par kya bole modiapako bataa den ki mangalvaar ko pradhanmantri ne dhandhuka main raily ko sambodhit kiya
 Here he said on the issue of Ram Mandir that in the midst of elections, now Congress is also associating itself with Ram Mandir, but they are not worried about the nation
 supreme court main mandir masale kii sunwaayee par piem modi ne kaha ki kal kapil sibbal babari masjid ke pakshakaron kii taraf se bol rahe the, yah unka kaam he, isse shikaayat nahin he
 But should they demand to postpone the hearing till 2019, is the Congress trying to postpone the Ram temple issue till the election
 shah ne bhi poocha tha sawalis mudde par mangalvaar ko bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne sidhe rahul gandhi se sawaal daaga tha
 He asked what is your party and your stand regarding Ram temple? While giving a press conference on the Ram temple issue, Amit Shah said that the BJP wants a hearing in the Supreme Court and a decision should be taken at the earliest
 jisase ayodhya main bhagwaan shriram kaa bhavy mandir ban sake, jo ki desh kii aasthaa se judaa hua he
 Why is there opposition to temple-temple Rahul? BJP president Amit Shah said that what is going to be achieved by finally stopping the hearing of Ram temple case
 unhone kaha ki ram mandir cese kii sunwaayee ko lekar congress party ko apana rukh spasht karnaa chahie
 He said that on one hand Rahul Gandhi is going to the temple in Gujarat, on the other hand Kapil Sibal is being used to postpone the hearing on the Ram Janmabhoomi case
 congress party ko apana ruukh spasht karnaa chahie
 In cricket, since the rules of no ball have changed, the batsman tries to score the maximum number of runs on the free hit ball after the no ball
 free hit par ran banane ke liye batsman reverse swip, slog swip or ramp shot tak khilne se nahin chukta
 But our Test captain and one-day vice-captain Virat Kohli was shocked to see what he did in Mirpur
 mirpur main duusare vanade ke dauraan taskin ahamed chauthe over kii antim gend phenk rahe the
 Taskin overstepped the popping crease and the umpire called him a no ball
 kohli ke saamne agali gend packpani team ke ran rate ko badhaane kaa svarnim mauka tha kyonki vanade cricket main no ball ke baad gendbaaj kii agali gend ko batsmen ke saamne free hit ke taur par pesh kiya jaataa he
 This means that the batsman can only be run out on this ball under the rules of cricket
 ballebaaj anya prakaar se out nahin hota chaahe wo bold yaa kaich hi kyon na kar liya jaae
 That is, in the mind of a batsman facing a free hit ball, how to score maximum on that ball is just that
 lekin yahanviraat ne cover kshetra main ek dephenshiv shot khelaaaur ek ran bhi nahin bator sakaa
 Nobody understood why Virat did this
 sambhav he ki usne ampire ke no ball ke ishaare ko nahin dekha ho
 He may not know that the ball being thrown is for a free hit
 lekin kyaviraat jaise sanjeeda cricketerse aisi ummid kii ja sakati he?bataur ballebaaj maidan main utarane ke baavjood wo itnaa laaparvaah kaise ho saktaa he ki no ball ke ishaare ko dekh yaa sun tak na sakaa
 It is very difficult to say whether this one shot has any effect directly or indirectly on the outcome of the match, but it must have definitely hurt their fans
 yahaan tak kii match ke camentator bhi viraat ke is shot se aashcharyachakit ho gaye
 Then Kohli was playing with only 7 off 8 balls and the team's score was 21 runs at the loss of 1 wicket
 agar kohli is ball par chaukaa yaa chakka jadne kii koshish karte to ran rate ko nishchit taur par phayda pahunchataa or iske saath hi bangladeshi gendbaajon or fielders par dabaav
 Kohli finally returned to the pavilion after scoring 23 runs and Team India were all out for 200 runs

 The Delhi government had imposed the rule of aud-even on Delhi cars from January 1, but its real test was to be held on Monday
 ummiido ke mutabik dilli kii janata ne somvaar ko offis de hone ke baavjood is formule kaa saath diya
 Though metro stations witnessed a lot of rush, most people followed it
 dopaher 2 baje kareeb rajeev chowk metro stesan par baari bheed dekhi gai
 Due to this people had to face trouble
 subah ke satr main dilli trephic police ne kareeb 150 logon ke chaalaan kaate jo pehle din se kam tha
 Today, even if the cases were run, only cars with even number ran on the streets of Delhi
 aapako bataa den nae niyam ke tahat agar aapaki car kaa number 2,4,6,8,0 par khatm hota he to aap aaj dilli main gaadi chalaa sakate hai
 The challan will be deducted for driving those vehicles whose number ends at Odds ie 1,3,5,7,9
 parivahan mantri ne liya jaijadilli ke parivahan mantri gopal raay ne ravivaar ko koordination cameti kii baithak lee or somvaar ke liye kii gai taiyaariyon kii jayja liya
 Gopal Rai said that no concession will be given if rules are broken and strictly challan will be deducted
 niyam todaa to baari jurmaanadilli sarkaar ne pradooshan ko kam karne ke liye gadiyon par sakhti karnaa shuru kar diya he
 If the government's rule of the odd-even formula is broken, a heavy fine of Rs 2,000 will be imposed
 haalanki agar ek din main ek hi baar chaalaan kaata jayega
 In order to support aud-even in Delhi, people are leaving their vehicles at home and traveling by buses and metro
 vaishali metro stesan par subah se hi logon kii baari bheed dekhne ko mili
 At the token counter, people were seen standing in long queues
 logon ne kii pahal kii tarifdilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki aam aadmi party (aap) sarkaar ne is ashankaon ke baad bhi sam-visham yojana lagu karne kaa faisla kiya ki is kadam se party ke vot bank par pratikul asar pad saktaa he
 Kejriwal, however, stressed that people have praised the initiative and cooperated with the government in implementing the scheme as environmental protection is a major challenge
 ek kaarykram ke dauraan bole kejarivalek kitaab ke vimochan ke avasar par kejariwal ne kaha ki kareeb dedh maheene pehle jab sam-visham yojana par manthan chal rahaa tha to ashankaayen jaahir kii gai thim ki agar yojana lagu kii jaati he to dilli kii janata hamase niraash ho jaaegi or ham 2017 ke dilli nagar nigam chunaav haar jaaenge
 But this plan was important in view of the quick solution to the problems of traffic and pollution
 vot bank hi nahin he sabakushkejariwal ne kaha ki ham har cheez ko vot bank ke taur par nahin dekhte kyonki aise sochane se to ham logon ke phaayde ke liye kaam hi nahin kar paaenge
 If we were only concerned about vote bank and focused on traditional politics, then we would not be able to implement the all-odd scheme
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki yojana kii safalataa ne hamaare is bharose ko badhaayaa he ki yadi logon ko saath lekar chalaa jaae to mushkil kaam bhi sanbhale ja sakate hai
 Kejriwal said that there was no vote bank politics behind the scheme, nor was it intended to popularize another slogan for pollution-free Delhi
 logon ne party line se pare jaakar or samaaj ke sabhi tabakon ne is yojana kii tarif kii 
 He said that there were two ways of doing this
 ham niyam kii ghoshnaa karke iskaa ulanghan karne vaale har vaahan ko jabt kar sakate the lekin nishchit taur par yah vyaavhaarik samaadhaan nahin hota
 We had to make the public aware and take them along so that people themselves follow it
 ravivaar ko nahin lagu hogi yah yojanagauratlab he ki dilli sarkaar ne vaahanon se paidaa hone vaale pradooshan par lagaam lagane kii khatir ek prayog ke taur par sam-visham yojana kii shuruyaat pichhali ek janvari se kii he
 Under this scheme, private cars with even registration numbers can be run on even date and private cars with odd registration number on odd dates
 ravivaar ko donon tarah kii nijee kaaren chalaai ja sakati hai
 The scheme is currently implemented till January 15
 kendriya sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne somvaar ko kaha ki 75 pratishat se adhik saansad sansad kii kaarywahi sucharu rup se chalane dene ke paksh main hai, lekin bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) koyala block aavanton ke mudde par sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit karne par amada he
 Bansal also said that coal blocks in which production has not started, are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
 bansal ne kaha, '75 pratishat saansad sadan kii kaarywahi chalane dene ke paksh main hai, lekin bhaajapa jid par adi he
 'it is to be known that the opposition BJP is firm on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's resignation in view of the assembly elections to be held in two states later this year
 gujarat or himachal pradesh main is varsh chunaav hone hai
 Asked about the bjp's demand for cancellation of coal block allocations made by the UPA government to private companies, Bansal said, "we have to follow due process of law
" hamane (koyala blokon ke aavanton ke samay) bhaajapa ke mukhyamantriyon se sahmati lee thi
 Bansal said that the process of taking appropriate action in this case is on and CBI is investigating the necessary cases
 unhone kaha, 'bhaajapa kii maang janata ko gumraah karne ke liye he
 The monsoon session of Parliament ends on September 7
 lekin pichley ek saptaah se bhaajapa ke virodh ke kaaran sansad kii kaarywahi nahin chal pai he
 The BJP is demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on coal block allocation
 sieji ne apni rapat main kaha he ki koyala block aavanton main paardarshita ke abhaav ke kaaran sarkari khajaane ko 1

 saal 2014 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi or iske baad bihar chunaav main nitish kumaar ke liye chunavi ranneeti banane vaale prashanth kishor ab punjab vidhansabha chunaavon main congress ke prachaar abhiyaan kii kaman sanbhaalenge
 Prashant Kishore confirmed this in a conversation with NDTV
 congress ek dashak se punjab main satta se baahar he or is baar vah satta main vaapasi kii purajor koshish main juty he
 In view of this, the reins of the party in the state have also been handed over to Captain Amarinder Singh
 tippaniyan Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh, after talking to Kishore, handed him the command to formulate an election strategy
 sutron ke mutabik, is mulaakaat main mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ke bhattije manpreet badal ne bhi ahm bhoomik nibhaai he
 Manpreet Badal had recently merged his Punjab People's Party (PPP) with the Congress
 amarinder ke kareebi sutron ne kaha ki congress apni chunavi ranneeti ko isliye bhi dhardaar bana rahi he ki rajya main aam aadmi party kii bhi upasthiti he
 The Congress has been out of power in Punjab for a decade and this time it is trying hard to return to power
 isi ke maddenjar rajya main party kii bagdor bhi captain amarinder singh ko saunp di gai he
 The comments punjab congress ke pramukh amarinder singh ne kishor se baatcheet kar unhen chunavi ranneeti banane kii kaman saunp di he
 According to sources, Manpreet Badal, nephew of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, has also played an important role in this meeting
 manpreet badal ne abhi haal hi main apni punjab pipuls party (pipipi) kaa congress main vilay kiya tha
 Sources close to Amarinder said that the Congress is also making its election strategy sharper because the Aam Aadmi Party also has a presence in the state

 It was known to the people of Britain that the exit from the European Community meant two thousand challenges, but they confirmed the break
 americanyon ko pataa tha ki trump vahi karenge jo kah rahe hai, phir bhi logon ne unhen hi jitayaa
 On both occasions the tide of sentiment was so strong in the debates that facts and arguments were looking for a place to hide
 yah post truth yani satyottar athwa tathyottar yug he, jahaan faisle or bahasein tathy yaa pramaanon par aadhaarit nahin hotin
 Has the post-satyam era also arrived in India? Demonetisation seems to be India's first post fact or post facto phenomenon
 naukari, kaarobaar va rojgaar par notebandi ke asar ko to sarkaar or namchin agenciyon ke tathypurna dastavej (aarthik samiksha or rigerv bank ke akalan) bhi sweekaarte hai
 Neither huge black money came out of demonetisation, nor the government's treasury was filled, nor any big corrupt handcuffed yahaan tak ki sarkaar or rigerv bank notebandi ke safalataa-asafalataa ke aankadon ko bhi chupchaap pachaa gaye lekin iske baad bhi gramin or shahari (odisha or maharashtra) chunavi nateezon ne notebandi se nuksaan ko pare dhakel diya
 People decided on emotional expectations, rejecting both fact and experience, and honored the BJP with India's first post-truth victory
 notebandi kaa satyottar adhyay chunaavon se aage aarthik aankadon tak failaa he
 The Reserve Bank, the Statistics Department of the Government, Economic Review, all believed that demonetisation has brought recession
 nijee agenciyon or antarrashtriya sansthaaon ne (iemef-vishwa bank) tathy or anubhav ke aadhaar par notebandi se gahare aarthik nuksaan ko pramanit kiya
 
 
 
 lekin sarkaar ne aankadon ke jariye kaha ki notebandi vaali timahi main (jab jeben khaali thim) log pehle se zyada kharch (upbhog kharch) kar rahe the
 Companies were engaged in increasing investment to produce new ones
 maang itani joardaar thi ki aayaat balliyon uchhal rahaa tha
 The government was also spending freely
 yani ki notebandi ke maheene bhartiya arthvyavastha ke sabase shandaar maheenon main the
 The fact is that last year's figures were reduced to show faster growth
 companiyon kii bikri giri
 Bank loan demand was at its lowest level in 60 years, but it is a difficult time for facts
 satyottar samay ke pramaan or bhi hai
 The new socialism under the leadership of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is a post truth experiment
 kaaryakartaaon kii dabangai vaali puraani sapa, ant tak akhilesh kii peeth par savaar rahi
 They kept removing the taint and taking them back to the party and despite this people were ready to believe that SP has changed
 shivasena or bhaajapa maharashtra main lambey samay se har paap-punya main saajheedaar rahi hai
 This time in the civic elections, both of them entered the field separately
 congress, ensipi or manase ke dalbadaluon ke sahare bhaajapa ne takat badha lee
 People came out to change the rule against corruption in a big way, but they lost their hands, then the same Shiv sena-bjp pair that they wanted to change
 yah bhi post truth hi he ki notebandi ke baad sirf varanasi main teen din ke chunaav prachaar main karodon kharch ho gaye yaa jis chunaav se pehle supreme court ne dharm or jati ke istemaal par roak lagaai, usamen pradhanmantri se lekar sabhi dalon ke adana kaaryakartaaon tak ne samaaj ko baantne kii koshishon main koi kasar nahin chodi
 What is it that collectively throws people away from truth, fact, logic, and evidence on sensitive occasions? Cognitiveists Hugo Mercier and Dan Spurber try to find out in their new book, The Enigma of Reason Is that why logic and facts do not affect the mind? Psychologists engaged in various experiments have only been able to know that we have become hyper-social, which is probably a psychosis
 tark kaa janm samuhik rup se samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye hua tha lekin atisamaajikta ne samuhik rup se apni baat ko sahi maanane yaa sab kuch pataa hone ke bhram ko viksit kiya he jo tathy, satya or tark kaa bedaa gark kar rahi hai
 Politics has been a clash of ideas, principles, plans so far
 satya or tathy chirantan hai
 Post truth society is a big challenge for today's governance, politics and economic policies because in a complex society, when the policies of the government are required to be based on facts and authentic figures, then society is rebelling from the roles of fact, logic and truth

 The biggest scam of any Indian company so far, even more shocking is that Ramalingam Raju himself, the chairman of the company, disclosed the scam
 is hakeekat ke khulaase ke baad puraa udyog jagat sakate main he
 Twenty years ago, the company whose foundation was founded by Ramalingam Raju and which he had made the fourth largest software exporter company in the country at the sight of it, it would be his fate, no one had thought
 raju ne company main ho rahe ghate ko chupaane ke liye puri duniya se jhooth bolaa
 The lie is not like that but for many years, the entire false balance sheet was presented before the world
 buudhvaar ko ramlingam raju ne istipha de diya he
 Raju, who holds an 8 per cent stake in Satyam, has shown his hand in all the mess that is going on in the company
 iske saath hi 30 sintabar ko khatm hui timahi main company kaa munafa bhi galat pesh kiya gaya tha
 The shareholders will suffer the most from this fraud of Raju
 haalanki videshi niveshkon par bhi companiyon ko chalaane ke in taur-tareekon kaa galat sandesh ja saktaa he
 Actually, Raju made all this mess to save his family's decaying real estate companies
 metas samooh kii in do companiyon kii deal ke baad se hi satrum ke shairdharakon ne virodh shuru kiya tha
 However, after Raju's resignation today, the shares of the company fell by almost 70 percent
 satyam ke chairman pad se istipha dene se pehle bi ramling raju ne board ke sadasyon ko mail likhakar apane kiye ghotaale kii baat ko kubal kiya he
 Raju has written that i am revealing the truth of my forgery in front of you with my heart full of regret and regret
 30 sitambar 2008 ko khatm hui timahi main-company kii balanceshit main 5040 karod rupye kaa farji bank balance or nakadi dikhaai gai he-isamen jo 376 karod rupye kaa byaaj milane kii baat he, wo galat he-1230 karod rupye kii farji dendaree kaa zikr bhi isamen kiya gaya he-munafa 61 karod ke bajaay 649 karod rupye bataaya gaya he-aamadani ko bhi 2112 karod ke bajaay 2700 karod rupye dikhaaya gaya he-khate main 588 karod rupye kii farji nakadi kaa zikr bhi hairaaju ne kaha he ki wo ab kanoonee karrwai kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar hai or unhone ye saare kadam company ko bachaane ke liye uthaae the
 It is obvious that if Satyam's great deal will be revealed, then the investors will be nervous, and this panic gradually destroyed the market trying to recover
 bazaar subah se jo ludhakna shuru hua, wo dopaher baad tak bhi nahin rukaa
 Satyam's own stock also lost nearly 78 per cent on Wednesday
 mangalvaar tak kaa iskaa bhav 179 rupye se zyada tha, lekin buudhvaar ko bazaar band hone tak ye 40 rupye par aa chukaa tha
 However, at one time its condition was thin, Satyam's stock had reached only 32 rupees, which nobody would have guessed
 centre sarkaar satyam maamle par nazar rakhe hue he
 Company Affairs Minister Premchand Gupta has said that serious action can be taken on this issue
 fikki kaa kahana he ki satyam masale se antarrashtriya str par isaki chhavi nahin prabhavit hogi
 The stock market is witnessing a period of tremendous decline following the revelations of the scam in Satyam
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki is ghotaale ne system main gadabadi ko ujagar kar diya he

 kahani yah he ki 1984 main banda jile ke ek netaa babulal kushvaha ne babu singh kushvaha kaa parichay basapa ke sansthaapak kanshiram se karaayaa
 Senior BSP leaders say that Kanshi Ram made Babu Singh Kushwaha the district president of BSP in Banda district in 1994 instead of Babulal Kushwaha
 phir kanshiram ne babu singh kushvaha or banda ke hi nasimuddin siddiki ko uttar pradesh ke pashchimi jile main party kaa kaam dekh raheen mayawati kaa sahyog karne kaa jimmaa saunpa
 The changes brought Kushwaha closer to the bsp's central leadership

 In 1995, Mayawati called Kushwaha to Lucknow
 yahaan kushvaha ko party gatividhiyon par nigaah rakhane ke saath hi mediakarmiyon ko party se judi suchanaaen bhejne kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya
 Gradually, Kushwaha became one of the most trusted people of Mayawati
 1997 main mayawati ke mukhyamantri banane par ve unke vishesh karyaadhikari bane
 In 2000, members of the Legislative Council were elected on the Kushwaha BSP ticket
 2002 main basapa kii sarkaar banane par babu singh kushvaha pehali baar mantri bane or inhen bhootatv, khanikarm vibhaag mila
 In 2007, when the BSP formed an absolute majority government, Kushwaha got the Panchayati Raj Department and was allotted a bungalow next to the government residence of Chief Minister Mayawati

 After the party's poor performance in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, it was Kushwaha who resigned from more than 100 corporation and board heads of the party and submitted to Mayawati

 jis saamaajik maahaul bigadane kii daleel di jari he wo keval bhopal main hi bighad rahaa tha, mumbai main uskaa asar kyon nahin ho rahaa he? Hindutva needs widespread Hindu public support for electoral success
 iskaa matlab he ki jatigat pahchaan ko zyada bade dharmik dhaanche main jajb kiya jaae or jatigat mulaahijon se upar saajha hiton vaale hindu samudaay ko badhaava diya jaae
 This religious identity becomes the basis for mobilizing votes, and the campaign is persuaded by the voters that Hindus may have internal differences, which are divided and intensified by caste but must be united for wider common interests
 isamen do raay he hi nahin ki jati saamaajik oonch-neech kaa aainaa he
 The result of non-equal, caste discrimination and a fierce political tone in independent India is that Dalits and obcs have been encouraged to reject this system
 unhone jati kii raajnneeti ko gale lagaaya or secular samaaj main adhikaron or hakon kaa daawa kiya, us samaaj main jisamen usulan sab baraabar hai or har kisi ko kamyaabi kaa mauka hasil karne kaa haq he
 After the Mandal Commission report, Parwan Chadhi caste politics seemed to be an enemy of Hindutva politics till 2014, as if the politics of Hindutva is only for the upper castes
 chunavi jaruraton ke chalate hindutv ko gale lagane vaali siyaasi partiyon ko jati kii raajnneeti ko jagah deni padi
 Hindutva had to seize the claims of caste and change the caste identity from 'pious' to 'righteous'
 hindutv dharm se jude rashtrawaad ke aadhaar par oonchi jatiyon ko aasaani se lamaband kar saktaa he par yah baat obisi or dalit samudaayon ko samajhane ke liye zyada kade vimarsh kii darkaar thi kyonki ye samudaay 'brahmanvaadi' mulya vyavastha ko lekar gahare andeh se ghire the or ise hindutv se jodakar dekhte the
 The ways in which Hindutva made inroads into these communities included adopting heroes of all castes and glorifying them as Hindu warriors
 hindutv ke sanghathanon ne aise nayakon kii 'jayantiyaan' manaane ke liye rakamen deen, murtiyon sthapit kin or unki jatigat pahachaanon se baahar unhen nayak kaa darja diya
 The heroes like Suheldev, who were once the heroes of the royal palaces, were termed as Hindu heroes by the RSS, as they say that they had defeated the general of Ghaznavi
 oonchi jatiyon ke daman kaa virodh karne vaale baldev or daldev sareekhe paasi raajaaon ke bhi utsav manaae gaye, jo kabhi basapa jaisi partiyon ke nayak or pratik hua karte the par ab rashtriya hero hai
 Among the heroes adopted in this way are Ravidas and Supach Rishi of the Jatava community; dina-bhadri, worshiped in the Musahar community by fighting for the rights of bonded laborers; Includes Ahir Naik Lorik Yadav
 inamen sabase mashhoor sardaar vallabhbhai patel (kurmi samudaay ke) hai jinhen hindutv kii kinvadanti ke mutabik unka haq nahin diya gaya
 In 2014, the BJP took a huge advantage in embracing the heroes of castes in 2014
 suheldev ab nichali jati ke prachand raja hi nahin the, videshi aakrantha se raashtra kii raksha karne vaale the
 This helped to bring the dalit and OBC voters of the state to the BJP
 bhaajapa kii aguai vaali sarkaar ne gajipur se dilli kii nai 'superfast' rail kaa naam bhi suheldev par rakhaa
 The politics of Hindutva cleverly merged the heroes of the castes into national heroes and thus managed to merge Hindustan, Hinduism and Hindutva into one unbroken idea
 yahi vajah he ki pulavama, balakot or rashtriya suraksha par bhaajapa netaaon kii laffaaji ko ram mandir par unki laffaaji se alag kar paanaa mushkil he
 'vikas' may be the slogan of 2014, but terrorism and temple seems to be the basic agenda of the BJP
 hindutv kii raajnneeti ne khud ko 'raashtra' or 'rashtriya hit' ke baraabar rakhane kii koshish kii he, jiske bheetar baad main jati ko samahit kiya gaya he
 The RSS has done a lot of work in the non-jatav Dalit communities of the Hindi belt and non-yadav obcs
 usne gujarat se tripura tak janajaatiy ilaakon main adivaasiyon, khanabadoshon or duusari darkinar jatiyon ke bich bhi kaam kiya he
 The intention behind this was always to mobilize the political potential of these groups in UP, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and convert their service, their social work into precious votes
 vakt ke saath bhaajapa jati kii chetana ko hindutv kii chetana ke saath jodgaye main, jatigat daman ke pratirodh se hatakar jatigat itihaas kii kirtiyon or kinvadantiyon par jor dene main kaamyaab rahi
 The discourses of Hindutva re-interpret the history, identity, resources, symbols and cultures of these communities and relate them to the Vedas, Puranas and the self-proclaimed Hindu narrative of Rama
 is aam chunaav main bhartiya janata party ne aakankshaon kii kahin zyada khamosh apil ke saath rashtravaadi or hindutv ke rupakon kaa tanabana khadaa kiya he
 BJP has also formed alliances with caste-based parties in order to garner SC and OBC votes
 kendriya mantri anupriya patel (uttar pradesh kii kurmi jati) kii aguai vaale apana dal yaa rajya ke purab main asardaar uttar pradesh ke mantri omprakash rajbhar kii aguai vaali suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke saath uske gathbandhan ko hi len
 This alliance certainly helped five years ago

 The Hindus of the upper castes are largely with the ideology of Hindutva
 kai vaisya samudaay bhi khud ko bhartiya janata party kaa aadhaar maanate hai
 Extensive caste alliances were formed in 2014, but there has been considerable upheaval since
 kya bhaajapa daliton or obisi ko aage bhi samajha paaegi ki unki bhalaai party ke saath rahane main hi he or hindutv kaa rashtrawaad duusare alpsankhyak samudaayon ko na bhi shaamil kare par unhen apane main shaamil karata he?(badri narayan govind ballab pant soshal science institute, elahabaad main professor hai)*** The Delhi High Court has quashed the disqualification of the 20 Aam Aadmi Party mlas disqualified in the matter of the post of profit

 tanushri datta ne oshivada police stesan dwaara file kii gai bi-samari report, jisamen naanaa patekar ko yon shoshan ke cese main clin chit di gai thi, kaa virodh kiya he
 Tanushree's lawyer Nitin Satpute represented him at the Railway Mobile Court in Andheri, Mumbai
 tanushri ko court ne bi-samari ke khilaaf protest petishan file karne kaa samay diya tha
 On this occasion, the entire legal team of Tanushree Dutta was present in the court
 haalanki oshivada police stesan kaa ek bhi afasar us samay court main maujuud nahin tha
 The court had extended the date of Tanushree's case to 7 September 2019
 oktober 2018 main tanushri datta ne naanaa patekar ke khilaaf FIR darj karwaai thi
 Tanushree had alleged that Nana had abused her on the sets of the film Horn Ok Pleasure in 2008
 unhone kaha tha ki naanaa ne jabardastee film ke gane kii koreography main intimet steps ko aid karavaaya tha
 Director Rakesh Sarang, choreographer Ganesh Acharya, producer Samee Siddiqui were also dragged into the case by Tanushree
 is report ke baad police ne sets par us samay maujuud rahe chashmadidon se sawaal-jawaab shuru kar die the
 Later, the Mumbai Oshiwara police station gave a clean chit to Nana Patekar in this case
 unka kahana tha ki unhen naanaa patekar ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin mili, jisase wo charge shit file nahin kar sakate or naa hi trial kii maang kar sakate hai
 Not only this, it was also said in the report that this complaint may have been filed in retaliation and it seems that it is fake
 aakhir main report main ye kaha gaya ki naanaa patekar, rakesh saarang, ganesh acharya or sami siddiki ke khilaaf koi pukhta saboot nahin mili hai
 The 13 eyewitnesses on the sets at the time, including choreographer / actress Daisy Shah, Tanushree's hair dresser, Spot Boy, said in their statements that they did not see anything in which Nana Patekar was exploiting Tanushree
 iske baad ek intervyuu ne bombai times ko ek intervyuu dete hue kaha tha ki kaise hamaari kanoon vyavastha gandi hai
 He also claimed that the police have no evidence as he has not recorded the statements of all the eyewitnesses of the people
 tanushri ne kaha tha, 'ye bhaddi baat he, kyonki naanaa patekar kaaphi samay se clin chit lene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 i had also told this in my first interview that all the witnesses are receiving threatening calls and they are being pressured to not record their statements with the police
 hamaare paas 10 gavaah hai, jinamein se sirf ek-aadh hi bayaan ko record kiya gaya he
 The rest did not come forward as they were threatened
 'unhone aage kaha tha, 'police kahati he ki uske paas saboot nahin he
 How will the evidence be found, if the perpetrator is paying full attention to the fact that the evidence against him should not reach Piles at all? The witnesses whose statements the police have recorded are their friends
 us samay film ke sets par maujuud logon main se koi bhi asal main meraa dost nahin tha
 With this, the witnesses did not say that nothing happened at that time, they said that they do not remember anything
 'vahiin duusari taraf naanaa patekar ne tanushri ko jhootha bataate hue kaha ki us samay sets par aisa kuch nahin ho saktaa tha kyonki vahaan us samay set par 50 log the
 After the defeat in Delhi's MCD election, Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal held a meeting with mlas and grassroots workers at his home
 is baithak main haar ke sabhi pahaluon par maathapai kii gai
 Let me tell you that according to sources, most of the mlas in the meeting did not hold evms responsible for the defeat
 arvind kejarivalsamet party ke kai netaaon ne haar kaa thikra iviem par phoda tha, lekin guuruuvaar ko hui baithak main kai netaaon ne haar ke liye iviem kii bajaay badi vajah modi lahar or jameen par party kii anupasthiti ko bataaya
 In fact, the mlas while speaking in this meeting said that it is not right to blame evms only for the defeat
 kuch vidhayakon ne kaha ki pradhanmantri modi kii lahar ko jis tarah se bijepi ne banane kii koshish ki vah bhi emsidi main mili haar kaa ek bada kaaran he
 Significantly, during the discussion in the meeting, the leadership also believed that after the defeat in Punjab, the morale of leaders and workers in Delhi was broken
 netaaon ko ummid thi ki punjab chunaav jeetne ke baad dilli main bade manobal ke saath nigam main jeet sunishchit hogi, lekin vahaan maamla kharaab hone ke baad uskaa sidhaa asar dilli ke emsidi chunaav par padaa
 The absence of the Aam Aadmi Party on the ground due to broken morale has been a major reason for this defeat
 himachal pradesh chunaav ke maddenjar pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kangra main raily ko sambodhit kiya
 Addressing the rally in Kangra, PM Modi said that many soldiers of Himachal have sacrificed for the country, remember that sacrifice before pressing the button

 i have worked in every street of Himachal
 piem modi ne raily main kaha ki is chunaav main congress kii himmat kii daad deni padegi, unke paas kuch nahin bachaa he
 The public is cleaning the Congress from all sides, yet the Congress is talking about the fight against corruption in its manifesto
 jabaki uske siem khud bhrashtachar ke aarope main fanse hai
 Modi said that if you do any work honestly and mistake, then the public forgives
 lekin agar jaanboojh kar koi galati kii, to desh maaf nahin karegaa
 Everywhere in the country people are punishing the Congress party

 com / max5kymxcc— BJP (@bjp4india)november 2, 2017piem ne kaha ki puraani katha main ham sunate the ki dev or daanav ke bich main ladaai hoti thi
 The Congress government has done the work of creating demons in front of the gods, sitting in the rule
 himachal kii janata ko paanch rakshason se chunaav main mukti chahie
 These five demons include mining mafia, forest mafia, drug mafia, tender mafia and transfer mafia
 modi ne kaha ki is baar mahilaayein purushon se bhi 5 fisadi zyada vot den or in rakshason ko khatm karen
 In Himachal, BJP has decided to contest elections under the leadership of former Chief Minister Prem Singh Dhumal
 yahaan 9 november ko vot daale jaaenge
 The PM said that i have eaten Himachal's grain
 unhone kaha ki pakistan kahata he ki kashmir ko aazaadee do, pakistan kaa samarthan karne vaale algaavvaadi bhi kehete hai kashmir ko aaazaad karo
 But our soldiers fight against them
 lekin congress ke netaa kehete hai ki kashmir kii aazaadee kii maang sahi he
 Not a single Congress leader is criticizing him
 modi ne kaha ki congress ke pehle kuch ore kehete the ab hamen upadesh dete hai
 When we say Congress Mukt Bharat, remind them that there is no longer a Congress with Mahatma Gandhi, nor a Congress with independence
 ham bhrashtachar vaali congress se desh ko mukt karnaa chaahate hai
 He said that when Pandit Nehru was the PM, he ruled from Panchayat to Parliament
 pandit nehru kehete the ki ham jansangh ko jad se ukhaad karke phenk denge
 But history is witness that we have also fed lotus in mud
 jab doklam vivaad hua to hamen kaha gaya ki 1962 ke yuddh ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie
 Modi attacked Rahul Gandhi and said that when the situation with China deteriorated, Rahul met the Chinese ambassador and asked Doklam
 unhone sarkaar, sena, sansad kaa apmaan kiya he
 The country cannot trust the words of such persons
 bijepi ne chunaavon ke liye apana vijan document jari kar diya he
 BJP released the vision document saying that we will have to work for 10 years
 unhone kaha ki shaayad hi kabhi himachal ko centre se itani madad mili ho
 Himachal has got many national level institutions
 centre ne kabhi bhedbhaav nahin kiya
 It is not seen whose government is in the state
 9 november ko himachal main matadaanabta den ki himachal pradesh ke liye vidhansabha chunaav matdaan 9 november ko hoga
 The last date for nomination for the 68-member Himachal Assembly was 23 October
 himachal pradesh main sabhi 7,521 matdaan kendron par VVPAT vaali voting mashiinon kaa istemaal kiya jayega or sabhi poling boothon kii videography hogi
 The controversy over the Rafale deal does not seem to stop
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne rafel deal par congress ko gheraa to kuch hi ghante ke bheetar rahul ne is par palatwaar kiya
 Rahul has asked Jaitley three questions on Rafael Deal
 ye hai teen savaalcongress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne jetali kii press conference ke kuch hi ghante baad teen sawaalon ke jariye un par palatwaar kiya he
 1
 rahul ne sawaal kiya he ki kya rafel ke pehle or duusare contract ke paison main antar he?2
 On what basis was the contract awarded to a businessman who did not construct a single plane plane in his entire life instead of a HAL company with 60 years of experience in making fighter planes? 3
 kya puri cabinet ne is contract ko paas kiya he? kya iske liesisies (cabinet cameti on security) se anumati lee gai, jiske khud jetali sadsy hai?sansad satr main deree par bhi gheraarahul ne piem modi par manamaane nirnay lene kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 Rahul said that it is a matter of national security
 rafel ke alaava rahul ne sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main deree ke liye bhi modi sarkaar ko gheraa
 Jaitley had asked- How did i remember after two and a half years, before this, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had a tremendous retaliation on the Congress
 jetali ne poocha tha ki aakhir congress ko gujarat chunaav ke samay hi kyon dhai saal pehle kii gai deal yaad aa rahi he
 Jaitley said that the Rafale deal could not be completed during the UPA government, which is proof that the previous government was a non-performing government
 deal main deree se kamjor ho rahi thi vayusenajetli ne kaha ki rafel deal main deree se bhartiya vayusena kii aakraamak kshamta kamjor ho rahi thi
 The Indian Air Force is in dire need of it, so we got this deal done soon
 unhone kaha ki ab yah samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki rafel deal ko dhai saal ho chuke hai, lekin is avadhi ke dauraan congress ne is par sawaal kyon nahin uthaae? gujarat chunaav main ab kaise rafel deal congress ko yaad aa gai
 Taking a dig at Tanjarahul Gandhi, Jaitley said that the Parliament session had to be called from December 15, which would last till January 5
 mujhe afsos he ki rahul gandhi is baar new year party main videsh nahin ja paaenge
 Before the French government has given the clarification, the Rafale deal has been responded to by France itself
 france ne is deal main kisi bhi tarah kaa ghotaalaa hone se inkaar kiya he
 Without naming the Congress on behalf of France, it has been said that the facts must be checked before making any claim
 congress kii ore se aarope lagaaya gaya he ki jahaajon kii keemat 526 karod he, jabaki sauda 1571 karod kaa hua he
 36 Rafael is coming from France
 Let us tell you that this deal was signed on 23 September 2016 by French Defense Minister Jean Evereans and the then Defense Minister of India Manohar Parrikar in New Delhi
 bharat sarkaar ne 59,000 karod kii france se deal kii thi
 According to the deal, 36 Rafale fighter jets are to be found

 Earlier this year, the High Court ordered the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) Inspector General Dinesh MN to take action against the corrupt
 gaayon kii maut ke baad naukarshahi ke munh par tamaacha jadte hue hycourt ne dinesh ko ek baar phir aadesh diya ki ve jaaen or maut kii vajahon kaa pataa lagaaein
 Dinesh was taking stern action against the officials involved in corruption including the bureaucrats and he was the one who arrested Singhvi
 lekin afasaron kii bhrasht lobby ke dabaav mank kuch hafton pehle unhen asibi se hataa diya gaya
 Later, the court summoned half a dozen senior officers and reprimanded them for negligence in the care of cows
 usne sarkaar ke kamjor jawaab ko khaarij kiya jisamen usne bataaya tha ki usne sankat ke samay chuttee par jane ke aaropee nichle darje ke do afasaron ko muattal kar diya he
 The government did not investigate the role of top officials, which has also been revealed by the court and viral videos
 hycourt ne yah bhi kaha ki adhikariyon ne nyaayalay ke nirdesh kii andekhi kii or tabhi chete jab pradhanmantri modi ne report talab kii
 Raje quickly took immediate steps and tried to improve the situation
 unhone gaayon ko nijee goshaalaon main bhijwa diya or hingonia ko god lene ke liye dharmik or korporate jagat ke logon ko nyotaa diya
 But the officers are still engaged in daub
 masalan, ve goshaala ke get par mehmaanon ke daakhile ke liye register rakhwa rahe hai or sisitivi camere lagava rahe hai
 This is the reason why the Congress found a sit-in issue led by its state president Sachin Pilot and attacked Hindu beliefs, which are at the top of the bjp's agenda
 gaayon kii maut ko lekar raaje ko party main bhi hamalon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he or isaki aguai ghanashyam tiwadi sareekhe unke virdohi kar rahe hai
 But Raje does not realize that some of his bureaucrats have created situations in which Hindu fundamentalists view him as anti-hindu
 isse pehle aise hi kuch afasaron ne ring road ke aasapaas or shahar ke bheetar metro ke kaam ke liye mandiron ko dhaha diya tha
 Then the RSS came out against Raje
 hingonia kii ghatana se kuch vakt pehle bhi bade naukarshahon ko naakaami se bari karne kii koshishen najar ain, jab asibi ne ek chif ejeeniyar aar
 K
 meena or ek atirikt chif ejeeniyar subodh jain ko bade rishwat ghotaale main pakadaa tha

 si
 Mohanty was introduced in the local media saying that the engineers had brought the government into disrepute
 magar har koi puch rahaa he ki kya raaje ne mohanti se sawaal kiya ki ve bhrasht afasaron kii bheji filon ko aankh mundakar manjuuri kyon de rahe the or unhone bhrashtachar ko rokane ke liye kabhi koi kadam kyon nahin uthaaya? india today ke saath baatcheet main aadha darjan varisht afasaron ne mana ki pichley 15 saal main unhone bhrashtachar ke liye apane kisi maatahat ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii
 At the same time, ACB officials admitted that no principal secretary or additional chief secretary ever sent them any complaints of corruption
 hingonia masalaa anya taali ja sakane vaali traasadiyon kii yaad dilaataa he
 These include the death of 12 children due to negligence at the Government Child Protection Home near Jaipur in April
 vahiin may main hycourt ne ek mahila kii gumshudagi ke maamle main police ke naakaaraapan kii safai dene ke liye dijipi manoj bhatta ko talab kiya tha to unako chakkar aa gaye the
 At the same time, an assistant sub-inspector, Sangeen Mujrim, was caught just before taking a bribe of one million rupees in exchange for leaving
 bhrashtachar se panape naakaaraapan ne logon ko itnaa naaraaz kar diya he ki ve bijepi ke khilaaf vot dene lage hai
 In the recent by-elections of 37 seats of panchayat and local bodies, the Congress increased its seats from 16 to 19, while bjp's seats fell from 16 to 10
 payalat kehete hai ki 21 jilon main faile or lakhon matadaataaon kii shirkat vaale ye upachunaav madhyavadhi janamat sangrah kii tarah the
 BJP state president Ashok Parnami says that most of the elections were held in areas where Congress has a strong base
 vaise unhone yah bhi kaha ki ve haar ke kaarnon kii padtaal karenge
 This is also important because in most interactions of BJP workers and mlas with ministers, the activists have expressed anger over corruption and inefficiency in the bureaucracy
 paranami ne bijepi sarkaar kaa aadha kaarykaal puraa hone par is kism kii baatcheet shuru karke acha hi kiya he, kyonki isse kaaryakartaaon ko apana gussa nikaalane kaa or unhen sudhaar ke kadam uthaane kaa mauka milegaa
 But only Raje will have to act against big officials involved in corruption

 The Trust Chairman said that Hindustan got independence after a big struggle

 Will the agreement between the two sides over the disputed site not lead to another split in Ayodhya? He said that only two years after the partition of the country, the efforts of Sardar Patel and other leaders paved the way for the construction of a grand temple on Somnath Jyotirlinga of Gujarat
 vahiin, ayodhya me shriram janmabhumi kaa vivaad nyaayalay ke chakkar lagaataa rahaa

 rajdhani dilli main haftaa nahin dene par kuch bekhauf badmaashon ne chikan corner chalaane vaale ek yuvak kii chaaku markar hatya kar di
 Police has started investigating the case by sending the dead body for postmortem
 peedit parivaar kaa aarope he ki yuvak ne is baat kii shikaayat police se bhi kii thi, lekin police ne is maamle main koi karrwai nahin kii
 The incident of murder is in the Gandhi Nagar police station area of delhi
 rajdhani dilli main aparaadhiyon main police kaa khuf khatm hota ja rahaa he
 Police negligence on him is giving protection to criminals
 police kii is vifaltaa se shaadi se mahaj 3 maheene baad ek suhagan vidhwaa ho gai
 In fact, Shahabuddin, a young man living in Ajit Nagar of Gandhi Nagar police station area, used to run a chicken corner and feed his family
 3 maheene pehle hi uski shaadi hui thi
 Everything was going well
 is bich ilaake ke kuch gunde uske peeche pad gaye
 Started asking for weeks from him
 pareshaan hokar shahabuddin ne is baat kii shikaayat gandhi nagar thane main kii
 But the staff there convinced him by saying that now the crooks will not come to him
 lekin police kaa yahi aashwaasan shahabuddin ke liye jaanaleva sabit hua
 Late Friday night Shahabuddin was closing his chicken corner and going to his friend's shop nearby
 isi dauraan peechha kar rahe kuch badmaashon ne use gher liya or us par chaakuon se hamalaa kar diya
 People from the nearby immediately rushed him to the hospital but Shahabuddin died on the way
 soochna milane ke baad police maukey par pahunchi or shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 Police are now scanning footage of CCTV cameras installed around the police to identify the attackers
 is hatyakand se shahabuddin kaa parivaar sadame main he
 She was married three months ago
 yah abhi tak saaf nahin hua he ki 14 agast ko mumbai main nausena ke dockyard main khadi pandubbi ienes sindhurakshak main itnaa bhayankar visphot kaise ho gaya, jiske chalate vah pani main dub gai or usamen savaar 17 nausena karmi shahid ho gaye
 Lieutenant Commander Nikhilesh Pal was also among those martyred
 nausena pramukh admiral di
 K
 joshi ne bataaya ki vahaan do visphot hue
 Naval officials investigating the crash in the same submarine in Visakhapatnam in February 2010 estimated that it may have exploded due to the formation of hydrogen gas from its batteries because of the same explosion at that time
 mana ja rahaa he ki bydaree kampartment se hone vaale risaav ke chalate pandubbi main rakhe kareeb 10 ton ke tarpedo or anti ship mixilon main visphot ho gaya
 The 2,300-ton Sindhurakshak, manufactured in Russia, has become completely useless
 yah isi saal april main kuch nae badlaavon ke baad rus se lautaa tha
 Some new sensors and missiles were fitted in Russia, which cost about $ 80 million
 dushman ke yudhak jalpoton or pandubbiyon ko maar giraane ke liye istemaal hone vaali is pandubbi ke nasht hone se nausena ko baari nuksaan hua he, kyonki pani ke andar nausena kaa bedaa pehle se hi kamjor he
 The Navy has a total of 14 diesel submarines, while it needs 24
 pichley saal usne rus se 10 saal kii lij par parmaanu shakti se chalane vaali pandubbi ienes chakra lee thi or ab aisi hi ek or pandubbi lene kii baat chal rahi he
 In addition, the nuclear reactor of the first indigenously built ballistic missile submarine Arihant became operational on 9 August
 lekin isamen hone vaali deree ke chalate nausena kii yuddh kshamta par asar pad rahaa he
 Even to maintain his fleet of 14 submarines, he needs to take one submarine every year
 nausena ne 13 saal main ek bhi pandubbi nahin lee he
 According to the 2008 CAG report, more than half of the submarines have completed more than half of their life of 30 years
 nai pandubbiyaan teji se nahin aa rahi hai
 18,000 crores in 2005 to build six French-designed Scorpene submarines at Mazgaon Dockyard in Mumbai
 kaa contract hua tha, lekin vah bhi niyat samay se paanch saal peeche chal rahaa he
 The first such submarine was supposed to join the Navy fleet in 2012, but will be available only in 2017
 nausena ne 751 pandubbiyon ke liye 36,000 karod ru
 Has prepared six project plans
 ye pandubbiyaan videshi sahyog se banaai jaaengi
 Its contract has not been given to anyone yet and it may take 10 years
 nausena kii 10 kilo class kii saat pandubbiyon ko susajjit karne ke liye rus bheja janaa tha, lekin isamen do saal se zyada kii deree ho chuki he kyonki bhartiya shipyard tay samay par kaam puraa karne main naakaam rahe hai
 Knowledgeable people also point to the manpower crisis in the Navy
 nausena ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''paramparaagat pandubbi bede main sahi kaam ke liye sahi log nahin hai
 "also, the number of employees is excessive
 paanch saal pehle nausena main 300 pandubbi adhikari the
 But keeping in view the expansion plans, their number was increased to 700
 in yojanaon main chah scorpen pandubbiyaan bhi shaamil hai, jo 2020 tak nausena ke bede main shaamil ho sakati hai
 With such delays, including plans for scarpen submarines, the tenure of current officers has also been reduced from 18 months to 6 months in some cases
 jaahir he, samudr ke bheetar sankat badhata ja rahaa he
 Recently, Bal Bharti had changed the syllabus of the ninth standard, which sparked controversy
 dutt ne kaha ki kitaab main is tathy kaa koi zikr nahin he ki boforce maamle main rajeev gandhi ko ucchtam nyaayalay clin chit de chukaa he
 This is not only an insult to the court order but also to hide facts for political purposes

 ) Discussion on the formulation of the government in the congress-ncp Rotational CM wants with Shiv Sena for a five-year deputy CM for NCP Congress
 There has been a struggle to form a government in the politics of Church of Maharashtra
 ek taraf shivasena he, jo kisi bhi tarah se maharashtra main satta ke singhaasana par baithna chaahati he to duusari taraf ensipi he, jo apni sharton par shivasena ke saath milakar sarkaar bananaa chaahati he
 At the same time, the Congress has not yet been able to decide whether to befriend a satrap with opposite ideologies
 is bich satta main hissedari ko lekar bhi congress or ensipi main charchaa chal rahi he
 On Tuesday, three Congress leaders Ahmed Patel, Mallikarjun Kharge and KC Venugopal from Delhi met with NCP chief Sharad Pawar at the YB Chavan Center in Mumbai
 sutron ke mutabik, is baithak main chaar ahm binduon par charchaa hui
 The NCP emphasized that the Congress should be part of the government for a stable government
 jabaki congress kaa jor kaaman minimum program par rahaa
 At the same time, NCP put forward its formula on stake in government
 roteshnal siem chaahati he ensipisutron ke mutabik, congress or ensipi kii baithak main mukhyamantri pad ko lekar bhi charchaa hui he
 In the meeting, the NCP laid down the formula to divide the Chief Minister's post between the Shiv Sena and it for two-and-a-half years, while the Congress should hold the post of Deputy CM for the full five years
 42 mantriyon vaala formulamumbai main ensipi ne jahaan siem or dipti siem ke formule kii charchaa kii to vahiin dilli main congress ke kheme se cabinet kaa formula saamne aayaa
 According to Congress sources, the party wants equal share of power among the three parties
 congress kaa formula he ki 42 cabinet mantri banaae jaaen or unamem se shivasena or ensipi ke saath 14-14 mantri baante jaaen
 That means 14 ministers of congress-shiv Sena and NCP should be in government
 iske saath hi congress kii najar grih or rajasav jaise ahm mantralayon par he
 The Congress believes that the sharing of such important ministries should also be appropriate
 yani sabase kam vidhayak hone ke baavjood bhi congress sarkaar main majbootee ke saath rahanaa chaahati he
 At the same time, the formula of two Deputy Chief Ministers is also at the center of discussion when the Shiv Sena is the Chief Minister
 haalanki, in tamaam masalon par abhi tak teenon dalon ke bich koi spasht baatcheet nahin ho pai he
 On Tuesday, Ahmed Patel and Sharad Pawar of the ncp-congress meeting said that talks between the two parties are yet to be held and after that they will talk to the Shiv Sena
 vahiin, ahamed patel or sharad pavaar kii press conference ke baad shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne media se baat kii or bataaya ki hamen bhi baatcheet ke liye samay kii jarurat he or isiilie shivasena ne rajyapal se mohalat maangi thi
 However, currently President's rule has come into force in Maharashtra and Shiv Sena has reached Supreme Court against this decision
 aise main jahaan supreme court ke faisle par sabaki najar he to yah dekhnaa bhi dilachasp hoga ki teenon dal kab tak ek manch par aa pate hai or agar sarkaar banati he to kis formule par baat final hoti he
 On the issue of starting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) senior leader LK Advani's 'jan Chetna Yatra' from Sitabadiara in Bihar, Narendra Modi has said that regretful and condemnable news of alleged estrangement has said that he should work very closely with Advani Have had the privilege to do
 modi ne apane blog par likhaa he, 'lekin kuch swaarthee tatv jis tarah kii chutkiyaan le rahe hai, vah atyant khedjanak va nindaneey he

 modi ne apane blog par likhaa, 'adwani ji ne desh seva main apni puri javaani laga di
 He has served the country continuously for 60 years and in that too, he spent 90 percent of his life in the service of the country by staying in the opposing party
 varsh 1952 se lekar aaj tak kadam-kadam par vah janata ke sukh dukh ke gavaah rahe hai
 i pity those who make such a ridiculous statement when a leader like Advani travels for the attainment of a post
 'adwani kii jan chetana yatra ke samarthan main utre modi ne kaha ki unki yatra jaiprakash narayan kii jayanti or janmasthali se nikal rahi he, yah susangat he
 He said that sometimes pleasant events also take shape
 jis bihar rajya main kabhi adwani ke rath ko roak diya gaya tha, usee bihar se ve apni yatra kii shuruyaat kar rahe hai
 Modi writes, 'this public consciousness journey of Advani ji is of great importance as it aims to fight against corruption, there is a demand to bring black money from abroad
 mujhe vishwaas he ki unki yah jan chetana yatra bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf janashakti kaa sanchaar karegi

 kanya, naam anchal reddy
 One who writes love stories
 jin par yun to vah khud bhi yakeen nahin karti
 But what to do, this is what the market needs
 yudi apni car or kismat waapas paane ke liye karata he ek samjhauta
 An Indian single-screen film star Armaan, kissing herself, decides to write the script
 vaise likhane jaisaa kuch he nahin
 Just watching a lot of foreign films, have to write something to take inspiration from Annu Malik and Pritam Marka
 yahaan se yudi or anchal kii film ke seen ke hisaab se lav story shuru hoti he
 First jerk
 phir hi ij note dait bed
 This was followed by a trip, bad and good experience and tripping on the end bed
 ab kahani main twist aana chahie
 So happy ending in emotional drama and last
 teden
 Amidst all this is ud's friend, who is afraid of his wife
 yudi kii eks garlfriend he
 Which has now become his friend philosopher and guide
 or ekairtating maujuuda garlfriend he, jisase yudi peechha chhudaana chahta he
 The biggest feature of the film 'happy Ending' is its dialogues, which are very fresh and broken
 ye bhachaak se aapke chehre par padate hai
 But the biggest weakness of the film around it
 or vah he kahani
 It seems as if a cocktail of Saif Ali Khan's films like Hum, Tum, Salaam Namaste, Cocktail, etc
 has been made
 nirdeshak ye kah sakate hai ki sahab hamane to pehle hi film ke poster par likh diya tha
 a Comedy on Comedy Films
 magar sirf itane se aapaki kachi loi nahin ho jaati sar ji
 This is dishonest saf ali khan parde par buudhe dikhte hai
 Now his character full of loafers and boys looks like some porn
 puraani curry main ubaal sa
 Ileana Di Cruz is doing the same role continuously after Barfi
 na to kuch variety he or na hi bahut range
 Apart from this, all are excellent
 kalki koechalin ko khijhaane vaali garlfriend ke role kaa patent hasil kar lenaa chahie
 First Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and now this film
 vah kamaal kii hai
 Similarly, the role of troubled friend can be reserved for Ranveer Shorey
 badhiya kamedi timming he unki
 Superstar Govinda comes on screen and laughs like the nineties
 ye unke liye bilkul tailor maid role tha
 Similarly, it is easy to see Preity Zinta on screen after a long time
 vah aaj bhi bahut pyaari or sanjeeda dikhti hai
 The music of the film is not great
 par bura bhi nahin he
 Most of the songs were remembered by the public sitting around
 jaahir he ki hit ho gaye hai baraste efem
 The pace of the film is fine and the length is not too much
 magar anding
 Around which the film's title was woven is highly anticipated
 yaheen film dharashayi hoti lagati he
 Goya director may have come under pressure to do 'happy Ending' after making fun of the same philosophy throughout the film
 iske alaava yudi kaa apane hi dabl role vaale shaks se akele main baat karnaa, salaah lenaa bhi ghisa hua formula he, jo yahaan bhi kuch khaas nahin kar paata
 Direct Raj and Krishna have previously made films like Shor in the City and Go Goa Gone
 unka bhi yahi haal tha
 Full of possibilities, but also many bags
 yahaan is diarector jodi ne film ke dialogs par khub mehnat kii he
 There is also some freshness in terms of location and treatment
 magar story ko jabaran smart banane ke pher main ghapala ho gaya he
 You can see 'happy Ending', if you like comedy with sharp dialogues
 agar saf ali khan ab bhi handsam lagata he or eliana kute
 The film can also be seen for Govinda, Kalki, Ranveer, Preity
 everej se kuch upar he ye
 Its 'happy ending' is the average

 Amid a growing controversy over the meeting between Pakistan's National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz and the separatist Hurriyat leaders of Kashmir, it is being clarified by the government that if the meeting comes after the talks of the National Security Advisers, India objected to it No
 ek ucch padasth sarkari sutara ne enditivi india ko bataaya ki bharat kii aapatti enese str kii baatcheet se pehle paak-hurriyat mulaaqaat par he
 India will never accept that Pakistan should try to recognize Hurriyat as a third party in Kashmir problem
 is samasya ke do hi paksh hai
 India and Pakistan
 alabatta donon deshon ke enese kii baithak ke baad azeez agar hurriyat se milte hai to is par bharat ko koi aapatti nahin
 It is worth mentioning that in August last year, Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit met the Hurriyat leaders in Delhi before the foreign secretaries held talks on 25 August in Islamabad
 pratikriya main bharat ne videsh sachiv str kii baatcheet ko radd kar diya tha
 India is still taking the same line that Pakistan does not approve of Hurriyat meeting before talks between the two governments
 duusari taraf pakistani ucchayog ke sutara ne enditivi ko bataaya ki hurriyat ke sartaaj azeez kii mulaaqaat 23 agast kii shaam yojit kii gai daavat ke dauraan hogi
 However, the source of the High Commission also says that Pakistan does not believe in the condition before or after
 tippaniyan First of all, the time for the meeting between the national security officials has not been decided yet
 ye yaad dilaae jane par ki baithak kii tarikh 23 agast tay he or aise main baithak dopaher ke vakt rakhe jane kii sambhaavna he, pakistani sutara kaa kahana he ki abhi kaarykram ko fine tun kiya ja rahaa he
 The source also did not clarify whether Pakistan wants to hold talks on August 24 or to continue talks on August 24
 darasal pakistan kisi bhi surat main hurriyat netaaon ko ye ehsaas nahin dilaanaa chahta ki unhen haashie par rakh kar chalaa ja rahaa he
 It is also that at any cost to the Hurriyat, it is accepting the terms of negotiations with India
 ufaa main bharat or pakistan ke pradhanmantriyon ke bich mulaaqaat se pehle maahaul na kharaab ho isliye pakistan ne hurriyat ko di gai iftaar party nahin kii thi
 Syed Ali Shah Geelani was so upset with this that he stayed away from the Eid Milan ceremony of the Pakistan High Commission
 is samaaroh main shariq hue mirwiz umr farook ne bhi shikayati lehza apanaaya tha
 Pakistan does not want to annoy the Hurriyat again
 bharat kabhi ye sweekaar nahin karegaa ki kashmir samasya main pakistan hurriyat ko ek tisare paksh ke taur par manyata dene kii koshish kare
 There are only two sides to this problem
 bharat or pakistan
 However, if Aziz meets the Hurriyat after the NSA meeting of the two countries, India has no objection
 gauratlab he ki pichley saal agast main videsh sachivon ke bich islamabad main 25 agast ko hone vaali baatcheet se pehle dilli main pakistani ucchayukta abdul basit ne hurriyat netaaon se mulaaqaat kii thi
 In response, India canceled the Foreign Secretary level talks
 bharat ab bhi vahi line le rahaa he ki do sarkaron ke bich baatcheet se pehle pakistan ko hurriyat se mulaaqaat use manzur nahin
 On the other hand, sources in the Pakistani High Commission told NDTV that Hurriyat's Sartaj Aziz would meet during the feast held on the evening of 23 August
 haalanki saath hi ucchayog ke sutara kaa ye bhi kahana he ki pakistan pehle yaa baad kii shart main bharosa nahin karata
 The comments awwal to abhi rashtriya suraksha salarkaron ke bich baithak kaa vakt hi tay nahin hua he
 On being reminded that the date of the meeting is set to be 23 August and the meeting is likely to be held in the afternoon, the Pakistani source says that the program is being fine-tuned right now
 sutara ne ye bhi saaf nahin kiya ki kya pakistan 24 agast ko hi baatcheet rakhana chahta he yaa 24 agast ko bhi baatcheet jari rakhana chahta he
 In fact, Pakistan does not want to make Hurriyat leaders realize that they are being marginalized and run away
 ye bhi ki kisi bhi tarah se hurriyat kii qeemat par wo bharat se baatcheet kii sharton ko maan rahaa he
 Before the meeting between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in Ufa, the atmosphere did not deteriorate, so Pakistan did not do the iftar party given to Hurriyat
 syed ali shah gilaani isse itane khapha hue the ki ve pakistan ucchayog ke id milan samaaroh se bhi dur rahe
 Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who attended the ceremony, also adopted a complaining tone

 is samaaroh main shariq hue mirwiz umr farook ne bhi shikayati lehza apanaaya tha
 Pakistan does not want to annoy the Hurriyat again
 ye bhi ki kisi bhi tarah se hurriyat kii qeemat par wo bharat se baatcheet kii sharton ko maan rahaa he
 Before the meeting between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in Ufa, the atmosphere did not deteriorate, so Pakistan did not do the iftar party given to Hurriyat
 syed ali shah gilaani isse itane khapha hue the ki ve pakistan ucchayog ke id milan samaaroh se bhi dur rahe
 Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who attended the ceremony, also adopted a complaining tone
 pakistan hurriyat ko phir se naaraaz nahin karnaa chahta
 Gadkari said - Not asking for a quarrel, Transport Minister Gadkari also gave many reasons for the recession
 Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman blamed ola-uber for the slowdown in the auto sector
 vitt mantri ke bayaan par kendriya parivahan or rajmarg mantri nitin gadakari se jab sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha ki jhagada karwaanaa he kya
 Actually, Nitin Gadkari was questioned by journalists on the statement of Nirmala Sitharaman
 jawaab main nitin gadakari ne kaha ki main samajhataa hum ki aapane jo sawaal mujhase poocha he vah vivaad khadaa karne ke liye to nahin poocha
 If you are doing this to quarrel, do not do it
 unhone kaha ki vitt mantri ke bayaan kaa galat matlab nikaala gaya
 Explain that due to the slowdown in the auto sector, the country's auto industry is facing the lowest sales in the last 21 years
 isapar vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne mangalvaar ko safai dete hue kaha ki miliniells aajkal gaadi kharidne kii jagah ola-ubar ko tavajjo de rahe hai
 Gadkari said these reasons and Nitin Gadkari said that there are many reasons for the recession

 The Finance Minister had also given many reasons, the dispute on that is not justified
 pakistan ke dhur andar balakot strike ke kuch ghante pehle tak pradhanmantri narendra modi ne milane waalon ko jaraa-sa bhi ishaara nahin diya ki ve koi aitihaasik faisla kar chuke hai
 It was a decision that would put both the countries at the mouth of the war
 donon ke bich takaraav kaa yah manjar 2002 se hi jari he, jab pakistan kii shah par jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankwaadiyon ne jammu-kashmir ke kaaluchak main hamalaa kiya tha or 30 logon kii jaan le lee thi
 For the first time after 1971, India was going on an air strike within Pakistan
 yah faisla utana hi doorgaami asar vaala tha, jaise indira gandhi ne 1974 or atal bihari vaajapeyi ne 1998 main parmaanu pareekshan karke bharat kii parmaanu takat kaa elaan kiya tha
 This decision was indicative of a drastic change from Pakistan to India in the event of future terrorist attacks
 haalanki modi hari jhandi dene ke baad raat 9
 When he returned to his government residence 7, Lok Kalyan Marg at 30 pm, he was as calm and balanced as ever
 14 farvari ko pulavama main jaish-e-mohammad ke fidaayin hamale ke baad bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav kaa modi ke bhaashanon main khaas zikr nahin tha, jisamen siarpief ke 40 jawan maare gaye the
 But the Prime Minister's staff was surprised to see that they did not go to sleep even at midnight
 iske badale ve apni study main balakot hawaii hamale kii pragati kii jaankariyaan lete vakt filon par najar daalate rahe or email bhejte rahe
 At 3 am, the Prime Minister was informed that a fleet of fighter jets of the Indian Air Force has taken flight and is about to enter the Pakistan border soon
 aadhe ghante baad unhen bataaya gaya ki jet vimaanon ne pakistan main nishane par bam daag die hai or surakshit apane thikaanon par laut aae hai
 He also kept taking information about the losses in Pakistan after that

 Finally 9 in the morning

 It consists of Finance, Foreign, Home and Defense Ministers

 Why did Modi decide to cross the border? When he heard the news of the February 14 Pulwama terror attack, according to his colleagues, the death of security forces jawans was very angry with the courage of Gamzada and Jaish and their bosses in Pakistan
 Woke up unhone saarvajanik sabhaaon main kaha ki hamale ke doshiyon ko uskaa anjaam bhugatna hoga
 According to colleagues, Modi never takes any decision either in emotions or in a fitoor
 ve kehete hai ki sankat kaal main puri safai honi chahie ki aap chaahate kya hai, taaki jaisaa unke ek sahyogi kehete hai, ''koi apane saamaanya vajood se pukhta haisiyat main pahunch jaae
 "it was clear in Modi's mind that the air of his nuclear power that Pakistan has been showing for decades has to be removed forever
" iske pehle pakistan par hamale se bharat ko yahi hauva roktaa rahaa he or is tarah hamaare vikalp thode ho jaaya hote rahe hai
 This has given Pakistan the impetus to blood India in connection with low-cost terrorist attacks
 sitambar 2016 main udi hamale ke baad modi ne niyantran rekha ke paar sargical strike karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 23 people were killed in the Uri attack
 sargical strike kaa makasad yah sanket dena tha ki bharat javaabi karrwai se nahin hichkegaa
 Although critics said that such actions have been done before but it has not been stirred up
 pakistan par hamale kaa faisla karte vakt shaayad modi ne china ke ek general kii is ukti par amal kiya ki ''agar dushman se waakif ho or khud kaa bhi andaja he to aapako sau yudghon se bhi darane kii darkaar nahin he
 If you have your idea but not the enemy's, then with every victory you will also have to face defeat
 agar aapako na khud kaa andaja he, na dushman kaa to aap har ladaai haar jaaenge
 "there is no doubt that India is stronger than Pakistan
" vah teji se ubhartee aarthik takat he, yahaan surakshit bahumat kii sarkaar he or aisa netaa he, jo sakht or kai baar jokhim bhare faisle karne se nahin hichakataa
 Then, the Modi government has the support of the world's largest forces, apart from China
 duusari taraf, pakistan aarthik badahaali ke kagaar par khadaa he or vahaan fouj par ashrith kamjor netaa he
 Nevertheless, both China and the United States need it, one for increasing their strength and the other for the agreement in Afghanistan
 yah bhi ahm he ki pakistan parmaanu takat he isliye puri saavdhaanee barti jaani chahie, jiske bare main ek ucchpdasth sarkari sutara kehete hai, ''pehle hamalaa karne kii parmaanu niti ke saath asthir islamic najariya
 "modi was very clear that he would not hesitate to think about the devastations on both sides if Pulwama got involved with Pakistan in retaliation
" parmaanu hauve se lohamodi ke sahyogi is par bhi vichaar kar rahe the ki parmaanu yudgh ke kisi tarah ke khatre ko taalte hue saahasik or kalpanasheel hamalaa kya ho saktaa tha
 As one said, "we could not show courage without thinking like fools
" sankat kaal main pradhanmantri hameshaa sahi sawaal par ungali rakhte hai or khantee gujarati kii tarah hameshaa napha-nuksaan ko khangalate hai
 He believes that spending should not be more than the objective and wants to always question where we are and where we want to reach
 ''modi ne tab apni team ke saamne makasad kaa bayaan kiya ki bharat pakistan ke logon yaa uski sarkaar ke khilaaf nahin, balki vahaan aatanki guton or uske aakaaon ke khilaaf he
 Also, India's response should be in the same proportion that Pakistan has done
 bharat kii ore se koi hamalaa usee daayre main hona chahie, jise antarrashtriya birdari 'taarkik' karrwai maane
 Therefore, there was a need for balanced action at non-military bases ie terrorist training centers
 aam nagarikon yaa faujee thikaanon par kisi tarah ke nuksaan se bachaa janaa chahie tha
 "the objective was not to avoid war, but to keep it within the radius," says a colleague
 '' bharat ko pataa tha ki hawaii takat ke istemaal main jokhim hai lekin pradhanmantri ekadam spasht the ki hamen kuch aisa karnaa he, jo chaunkaa de
 Keeping this extent in mind, the Prime Minister had given a free hand to the National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and the Chiefs of the three wings of the Army to launch an attack on a limited target and inform them of all options
 ek duusare ucch stareey sahyogi ne khulaasa kiya, ''pradhanmantri ekadam spasht the ki kisi bhi surat main yuddh main ijapha nahin hona chahie
 There is no such goal
 ham kisi ilaake par kabja karne kii baat nahin soch rahe hai
 Both countries are aware of its danger
 '' modi ne unase kaha ki pakistan ko makul jawaab dene ke liye ve jarur kuch karen lekin yah bhi dhyaan rakhen ki aam logon kaa koi nuksaan na ho
 Every detail should be verified and the intelligence about the target should be very accurate
 isliye dobhaal, khufia agenciyon ke pramukh or sena ke teenon angon ke pramukh aise nishane kii talash main jute gaye jo 'puri tarah sateek' ho, yani kisi tarah kaa doosraa nuksaan usase na ho
 Why and how Balakot was elected After that, intelligence agencies searched about fifteen camps in Pakistan for attack
 lekin faisla yah kiya gaya ki pulavama hamale main jaish hi shaamil tha isliye usee ke shivi ko nishaanaa bananaa chahie
 Three such camps were identified: Bahawalpur in Punjab, Pakistan, Sawai Nala near Muzaffarabad (pakistan Occupied Kashmir) and Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
 bahawalpur ke shivi par hamale main aam logon ko hone vaale nuksaan se bachanaa mushkil tha, kyonki kai saal ke dauraan vahaan masjid, aspataal or training camp ubhar aae the or yah punjab ke ghani aabaadi vaale ilaake main he
 Sawai Nala is one of the largest camps of Jaish but it was not selected because it is in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok)
 2016 main udi hamale ke baad modi ne pioke main jaish ke camp par sargical strike kaa aadesh diya tha
 But the terror attack of Pulwama was so great that the Prime Minister had decided that the target should be bigger than the attack across the Line of Control
 is tarah balakot main jaish ke camp ko hi sahi nishane ke rup main chunaa gaya kyonki vah pakistan kii mukhya bhoomi main he
 This camp, known as Markaz Syed Ahmed Shaheed, was established in 2004-05 and is situated on the slope of the Jaba Top hill
 yah ilaaka sunsaan he or ghati se teen kimi kii khadi chadhaai ke baad hi yahaan pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 The camp has been monitored by Indian intelligence agencies for years
 isse vahaan unhone camp kii gatividhiyon kii jaankaree ke liye kuch bhedie bhi bana rakhe hai
 Spread over six acres, the camp has 10 large houses or premises for various activities
 sabase ahm baat yah he ki yah camp masood ajahar ke saale yusuf ajahar kii nigaraanee main chalata tha or vah yaheen ek imaarat main rahata tha jisamen pehle skool hua karata tha
 After India's airstrikes, Pakistan claimed that the camp had been vacated by Jaish years ago
 haalanki balakot camp par jab 26 farvari ke tadake hawaii hamale hue tab vah sunsaan nahin tha
 India Today has received details and photographs collected from Indian intelligence agencies, which reveal that the camp was full of jihadis and others (see Panic's den)
 camp viraanaa naheembhartiya agenciyon ke paas balakot se camp ke raste kii tasviren hai jinamein ek billboard par camp kii jaankaree or duusare par rangaruton kii bhartee kaa sandesh likhaa hua he
 Photographs show that the United States, Britain, and Israel flags have been carved on the steps leading to the main campus, so that those who pass through them are crushed under their feet
 mukhya parisar angreji ke akshar you ke aakaar ke ek bade haul jaisaa he
 It has eight rooms on the ground floor and a dormitory on the second floor

 In total there were about 200 recruits doing different types of training courses

 Recruits were invited for a new course on billboard advertising in Balakot city, which was to be trained from 25 February

 Doval was leading the core team for the planning of the air strike and informed the Prime Minister about Balakot
 19 farvari ko modi ne vaayu sena ko strike karne kii hari jhandi de di
 High-flying hero Air Chief Marshal Birendra Singh (tony) Dhanoa was shocked when he came to know that he had been selected to shoot
 dhanoa aisi strike kii yojana banane ke visheshgy maane jate hai or 2001 main jammu-kashmir vidhansabha main aatanki hamale ke baad pakistan par strike karne kii yojana banane kii jimmedaari jinhen saunpi gai thi, unamem ve bhi ek the
 Then he felt that there was no coordination between the armed forces and the Indian intelligence agencies about such information
 khufia adhikari ne unhen camp kii jaankaree di thi or yah bataaya tha ki vahaan paidal kaise pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 Dhanoa recalls that he had then said, "what do you want from me, go to a restaurant there and have lunch?" We need information about the geographical conditions through which we can carry out air strikes
 ''atharah saal baad ve yah jaanakar khush the ki bharat kii khufia jaankariyaan jutaney kii takanic main baari badlaav aa gaya he
 Dhanoa and his team were quite happy with the fine details of the Balakot campus, which had been gathered by the intelligence agencies
 camp kii haai rijolushan satellite tasveeron ke saath ye baarik jaankariyaan hamale ke dauraan unke payalton ke liye ahm sabit hotin
 After receiving the green signal from the Prime Minister, a team of top Air Force officers and key officers of intelligence agencies started meeting every day and preparing the specifics of the air strike
 pakistan pehle hi haai alert par tha, kyonki pradhanmantri modi lagaataar jansabhaon main yah elaan kar rahe the ki ve pulavama hamale ke doshiyon ko jarur sabak sikhayenge
 For the strike on the selected target in Balakot, the Air Force had to assure that Operation Silent, Sudden and Rapid
 isliye yojana ke mutabik, vaayu sena ne jammu or srinagar main raat main hawaii gasht kaa silsilaa kuch badha diya, taaki pakistan ko kisi aswabhaavik hawaii gatividhi kaa andaja na lage
 It was also kept in mind that the Bengaluru air show was on from February 20 to February 24 in choosing the strike time
 is dauraan anek ucchstareey antarrashtriya hastiyon ke rahete bharat yah strike nahin karnaa chahta tha
 The second reason was that the recruits were reaching Balakot on 25th
 isliye uske agle din camp par strike kaa behtareen vakt tha
 Senior officers of the Air Force maintained such a pattern till the night of the strike that everything was as common day so that Pakistani intelligence agencies would not get any clue
 25 taarikh kii shaam ko dhanoa pashchimi vaayu kaman ke mukhiya chandrashekharan hari kumaar ke vidaai samaaroh main shaamil hue
 Although Hari Kumar was leading the team that carried out the strike, it was decided to organize a farewell ceremony so that its cancellation would not give Pakistan any inkling
 takreeban raat 10 baje hi dhanoa ghar pahunche or strike kii monitering karne lage
 It was raining in Delhi then and he was worried that the weather would be bad in Balakot as well
 lekin khushkismati se vahaan aasmaan saaf tha
 Not only this, there was a moonlit night

 These bombs can hit the aircraft precisely with a guidance system through GPS and a camera

 Similarly, two IL-76 aircraft were also in the air for fueling
 pakistani vaayu sena ko kisi tarah kii bhanak na lage isliye ye vimaan agra or bareli ke thikaanon se udaae gaye
 As they were flying over Delhi, the Air Force warned the Air Traffic Control to provide a dark corridor in the air so that these aircraft could fly without detection
 jab ye vimaan pakistan ke aasmaan main pahunche to yah saavdhaanee barti gai thi ki ek bedaa bahawalpur kii ore jaataa hua dikhe
 Pakistan thought that the Indian Air Force jets were heading towards Jaish's headquarters, to stop them, the aircraft blew up on that side
 is chalaave se yah hua ki kuch neeche udaan bharne vaala miraj 2000 kaa bedaa balakot kii taraf bad gaya
 By the time they appeared on the Pakistani radar, these aircraft had moved 150 km ahead of the Pakistani jet
 uske baad miraj vimaanon ne camp ke nishane ko pahachaanaa or spice bam daag die
 Strike and then five bombs fell on the target

 One fell on the U-shaped main complex, where most of the Jaish leaders were, and the fifth fell on the building that housed the Ustad trainer
 ek nishane par strike nahin ho pai or vah tha khaali padaa skool, jisamen usoof ajahar rahata tha
 The reason was that the aircraft which was to attack him could not be targeted in a certain period of time
 sabhi vimaan usee raat apane-apane thikaanon par surakshit laut aae
 In addition to Doval, Dhanoa informed the chiefs of the army and navy that the mission was completed

 Knowing that everything was done safely, Modi went to do yoga at 4 am

 Pakistan strongly denied India's claim of a strike and sent a fleet of jets the next day to strike at Indian targets

 Meanwhile, India claimed that it also shot down a Pakistani F-16 aircraft
 lekin pakistan ne iskaa khandan kiya
 When Pakistan returned Abhinandan only after 48 hours, both the countries returned from the fears of war but kept their army on high alert
 bhartiya vaayu sena ko puraa yakeen he ki abhinandan ne vimaan se nikalne se pehle epa-16 vimaan ko maar giraaya tha kyonki nigaraanee kar rahe radar par saaf-saaf dikhaa ki vah neeche ja rahaa he
 Pakistan showed the debris, which according to it was the engine of the mig-21

 With no official information about how many people were killed in the strike, the speculations of political leaders started echoing in the air
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki jaish kecamp main 250 log maare gaye
 Opposition parties demanded that the Modi government show 'strong' evidence of airstrikes
 nishane par bam daagne kii pushti karne ke liye vaayu sena ke paas do tareeke ho sakate hai
 Synthetic aperture radar mounted on an aircraft, which can take a photo of the target at night, even if it has changed, and can send a photo of the target before and after the bombing, thereby confirming the claim of the Air Force
 duusare, optical satellite pikchar kuch dhundhale hai kyonki balakot ke upar kai dinon tak badal chhaae hue the
 In the meantime, international news agencies and researchers have brought to light satellite images that do not show any damage to the target camp

 This is the method of attack of Spice Bomb
 phir bhi ye shankaaen bani hui hai ki strike main jaish ke kitne log maare gaye
 According to Indian intelligence agencies, tapping a mobile conversation in that area showed that hours after the strike, the local police station registered a talk of 3 ambulances, who were bringing 35 bodies from the camp
 duusare, 37 ambulance bhi us ore jaati dekhi gayi
 There are also reports that some patients were treated at the Abbottabad Hospital, but these reports were not confirmed by the intelligence agencies
 haal main india today tivi ne ek sting oparation kiya jisamen balakot ke aasapaas ke ilaakon main kai logon ne hawaii hamale main mauton kii pushti kii
 Pakistan has laid siege around the camp and no one is allowed to visit that area
 isse bhi in shankaaon ko bal mila ki bahut kuch chupaaya ja rahaa he
 Most experts say that it will take some time to come out with the correct figures of death
 baharhaal, isamen koi andeh nahin he ki balakot main strike karke bharat ne saaf sandesh de diya he ki pakistan ke liye aatank ko shah dena ab aasaan nahin he
 He will also have to bear the consequences
 haalanki yah to itihaas hi batayega ki balakot hamalaa bharat ke liye pakistan ko apane napak taur-tareekon se baj aane kaa sabak sikhaa paaya yaa nahin
 In lieu of two other marks, Balakot was chosen because it is in the mainland of Pakistan and there is no threat of any kind of life to the army or common people
 The airstrikes of the bombs did not harm the rest of the life and property; 3 of the 5 Spice 2000 bombs used in the strike strike Entered from the roof, became air holes (built-in artist presentation) Hthiyarijrael Spice 2000 changes in the order of a thousand pound "smart" weapons

 Gambhir was then seen suddenly coming towards his junior teammate Kohli from Team India
 dilli ke hi ek anya ranjai khilaadi rajat bhaatia haalanki in donon ke bich main aa gaye or unhone gambhir ko shant karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Gambhir and Kohli did not overshadow the incident during the post-match award distribution
 yah poochne par ki kya vah bangalore ke apane samakaksh ke saath chaay piyenge, gambhir ne kaha, ‘kisi lamhen kii gahamagahami main kuch chijen ho jaati hai
 it's not a big deal
 ’ kohli ne bhi bahes ko adhik tool nahin dete hue kaha, ‘maidan par jo hua vah ho chukaa he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's adopted village Jayapur

 Asked by people, it was found out that the ATM opens at 10 am

 Why is there such tension, brother
 udata punjab naam thik na lage to udata pehlaaj rakh lo
 There will be two things if we make Punjab a first place
 anuswaar or ba ud jayega
 But at least p and h will remain
 saath main ba ke badale l or badi aa kii maatra ko thor mil jayega
 Both happy
 he ki nahin
 Nihalani will also be Nihal and Anurag's raga will also be changed to Bairag that Bhaiyya will make the next film on the story of Butt Savitri
 central board of film certification
 Central Board of Film Certification in Hindi
 kaayade se iskaa naam hona chahie kendriya kaant-chhaant uparant film pramann board
 That is, the film that will come, we will trim it and make it again
 jin logon ne gusse main pehlaaj nihlani ko ayogy kaha he main unase naaraaz hum
 i have always been pro-disqualified
 desh sirf yogya logon ke haath main rahegaa to itane saare ayogy kya jhaal bajaaenge
 In many states of this country, fifty percent of students fail in the board exams
 ye fail isliye hote hai kyonki fail hone se pehle koi inke bare main nahin sochataa he
 At least after failure, they should be thought about
 board se fail hue inhen lakhon chaatro main se kai aage chalakar tamaam tarah ke board ke chairman ban jate hai
 Therefore, disqualification is not permanent
 yogya bhi kabhi ayogy tha- is naam se chaahe to koi siriyal bana saktaa he
 Nihalani blamed the government's hard work in the name of replying to Anurag Kashyap
 abhi tak mantri kah rahe the ki udata punjab se punjab uda dene main sarkaar kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 "I heard that Anurag Kashyap has taken money from the Aam Aadmi Party for this film"
 kya pehlaaj nihlani apni is baat se board ke faisle ke peeche raajnneetik manshaa zaahir nahin kar rahe hai
 It has come to know that Pahlaj Nihalani not only watches the film but also listens to what are being said about the film! What is it less that Pahlaj sahib Sunni does not cut things heard
 jo bhi sunate hai us par yakeen kar lete hai! "if i am not the spoon of the Prime Minister of India, am i the spoon of the Prime Minister of Italy"
 “haa main modi kaa chamachaa hum jaisaa anuraag kashyap ne kaha he”
 These things of Pahlaj Nihalani should not shock even the Prime Minister
 unhone november 2015 main ‘meraa desh he mahaan’ naam se ek video film banaai thi, jisamen bachche pradhanmantri modi ko modi kaaka pukaarte hai
 Kaka is absolutely right to say until someone asks the BJP whether this uncle is a copy of Nehru
 ganimat he ki is par dhyaan nahin gaya
 The whole controversy was over that India has been told by showing scenes from abroad
 magar kisi vaidhanik board kaa mukhiya yah kahe ki main modi kaa chamachaa hum to meri raay main wo pradhanmantri kii saakh par batta laga rahaa he
 Nowadays, with so much hard work, it is being propagated how professionally the whole work works
 pehlaaj kii baton se lagata he ki modi sarkaar main chamachon kii bhi puch he
 Even during the video controversy, Pahlaj has said that i am proud of Chamchagiri
 aisa lagata he ki ve khud ko chamachagiri ke frem se azaad nahin kara paa rahe hai
 They themselves do not want to fly, so Udta flew from Punjab to Punjab
 mantri kah rahe hai ki board ke kaam main sarkaar kii bhoomika nahin he
 The head of the board is saying that i am the spoon of the Prime Minister of India
 kaayade se udata punjab vivaad se zyada ye sangeen maamla banataa he ki pehlaaj nihlani ko chairman ke pad se hataa diya jaae
 After the Prime Minister who has gone abroad, if his ministers or heads of institutions start saying that we are his spoon, then what will be his image in the country and the world
 kahin vipaksh ne modi sarkaar par chamachaa raaj kaa label chipka diya to? isliye sansthaaon ke pramukhon ko jawaab bhi apane daayre main dena chahie
 They do not have the freedom to speak anything
 agar ve apni abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kaa aseemit istamaal kar sakate hai to phir kis haq se udata punjab par kanchi chalaa rahe hai
 In my opinion, Pahlaj saheb could also say that i believe in Prime Minister Modi
 pradhanmantri desh ke netaa hai, isliye mere bhi netaa hai
 What happened if Pahlaj did not make good films
 hindi main dhang kii kuch screept bhi padhi hoti to ve pradhanmantri se jod kar aisi bhashaa kaa istemaal nahin karte
 When you call yourself someone's spoon, you do damage to that which you proclaim to be a spoon, as well as you prove to your opponents that you are not worthy
 tippaniyan Pahlaj has said that Udta Punjab has not been cut because of Punjab elections
 unke anusaar agar koi puri film dekhegaa to vahi samaj saktaa he ki punjab shabd ko kyon dilit kiya gaya he
 What a pleasure
 he na! naam or seen udaane ke baad unhone kisi ko pataa lagane laayak film ko choda bhi he ki punjab kyon dilit kiya
 However, instead of flying Punjab, you should keep watching Udta Pahlaj
 pehlaaj sahab ko dictator kahlaana pasand nahin, haa ve khud ko chamachaa kahlaana zarur pasand karte hai
 Central Board of Film Certification
 hindi main kendriya film pramann board
 Ideally, it should be named Central Film Certification Board after certification
 yani jo film aegi use ham kaant chhaant kar phir se bana kar denge
 i am angry with those who have angrily called Pahlaj Nihalani ineligible
 main hameshaa se pro-ayogy rahaa hum yani ayogy samarthak
 If the country remains in the hands of only deserving people, then what will be done by so many inept
 is desh ke kai rajyon main board kii pariksha main pachaas fisadi chaatr fail ho jate hai
 These failures happen because no one thinks about them before they fail
 kam se kam fail hone ke baad to inke bare main sochaa jaae
 Many of these millions of students who have failed from the board go on to become chairman of all types of boards
 at: ayogyata sthaayee nahin hoti
 Worthy was also unfit - anyone can make a serial with this name
 nihlani ne anuraag kashyap ko jawaab dene ke naam par sarkaar kii mehnat par pani pher diya
 Till now, the minister was saying that the government has no role in blowing up Udta Punjab to Punjab
 “maine suna he ki anuraag kashyap ne is film ke liye aam aadmi party se paise liye hai”
 Is Pahlaj Nihalani not expressing political motive behind the board's decision with this matter
 ye to pataa chal gaya ki pehlaaj nihlani sirf film nahin dekhte balki film ke bare main kya kya baaten kahi ja rahi hai wo bhi sunate hai! ye kya kam he ki pehlaaj sahab suni sunai baton kii kaant-chhaant nahin karte
 Believe in whatever you hear! “agar main bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa chamachaa nahin hum to kya main italy ke pradhanmantri kaa chamachaa hum”
 "yes, i am the spoon of Modi as Anurag Kashyap has said"
 pehlaaj nihlani kii in baton se pradhanmantri ko bhi jhatka na lag jaae
 He made a video film titled 'mera Desh Hai Mahan' in November 2015, in which children call Prime Minister Modi Modi
 kaaka kahana bilkul thik he jabatak ki bijepi se koi yah sawaal na kar de ki kahin ye chachaa nehru kii nakal to nahin he
 Thankfully, it did not go unnoticed
 sara vivaad is par tha ki isamen videshon ke seen dikhaakar bharat ke bataaye gaye hai
 But if the head of a statutory board says that i am Modi's spoon, in my opinion, he is betting on the credit of the Prime Minister
 aaj kal itani mehnat se yah prachaar ho rahaa he ki puri saraakaar kis kadar peshewar tareeke se kaam karti he
 From the words of Pahlaj, it seems that in the Modi government there is also a question of spoon
 video ke vivaad ke vakt bhi pehlaaj kah chuke hai ki mujhe chamachagiri par garv he
 It seems that they are not able to free themselves from the frame of Chamchagiri
 ve khud udana nahin chaahate hai isliye udata punjab se punjab uda diya
 The minister is saying that the government has no role in the work of the board
 board ke mukhiya kah rahe hai ki main bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa chamachaa hum
 It is more a matter of concern than the flying Punjab dispute that Pahlaj Nihalani should be removed as chairman
 videsh yatra par gaye pradhanmantri ke peeche agar unke mantri yaa sansthaaon ke mukhiya yah bolne lagen ki ham unke chamache hai to desh-duniya main unki kya chhavi rah jaaegi
 Did the opposition paste the label of Chamcha Raj on the Modi government? Therefore, the heads of the institutions should also give answers within their scope
 unke paas kuch bhi bolne kii chhot nahin he
 If they can use their freedom of expression unlimitedly, then by what right are flying scissors on Punjab
 meri raay main pehlaaj sahab is tarah se bhi kah sakate the ki main pradhanmantri modi main vishwaas rakhata hum
 The Prime Minister is the leader of the country, so is my leader
 pehlaaj ne acchhee filmein nahin banaain to kya hua
 Had he even read some scripts of style in Hindi, he would not have used such language in connection with the Prime Minister
 jab aap khud ko kisi kaa chamachaa kehete hai to aap uskaa to nuksaan karte hi hai jiskaa chamachaa hone kaa aap elaan karte hai, saath hi aap apane virodhiyon kii wo baat sabit kar dete hai ki aap yogya nahin hai
 The comments pehlaaj ne kaha he ki punjab chunaavon ke kaaran udata punjab main kaant-chhaant nahin kii gai he
 According to him, if one watches the entire film, he can understand why the word Punjab has been deleted
 kitni kushi kii baat he
 Is not it! After blowing the name and scene, he has also left a film worth knowing why he was diligent in Punjab
 baharhaal udata punjab kii jagah aap dekhte rahiye udata pehlaaj

 Reversing the opposition that surrounded the government on demonetisation, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that demonetisation was done to make the country honest

 Rahul and his companions are upset over the government's strictness on thieves
 ravishankar ne kaha ki congress sabase bhrasht party or rahul gandhi main paripakvata kaa abhaav he

 kerala main kanoon kii padhai karne vaali ek dalit chaatra kii balaatkaar ke baad hatya kiye jane kaa maamla abhi thanda bhi nahin hua ki nursing kii padhai karne vaali ek dalit chaatra ke saath teen logon ne samuhik balaatkaar kii vaardaat ko anjaam de daalaa
 Taking the matter seriously, the police immediately registered a case and started action
 samuhikbalaatkaaraki yah sharmnaak vaardaat mangalvaar kii dersham vaarakala ke ayanti main hui
 a local police officer said that based on the complaint of the girl, a case has been registered against three people and investigation has started
 police ke mutabik biessi nursing ke duusare varsh main padhane vaali 19 varshiya chaatra ek autoricshaw main baithkar gai thi
 This driver was the student's identity
 baad main chaalak ke do dost bhi auto main savaar ho gaye
 They took the autorickshaw to a secluded place
 or vahaan teenon naildkike saath samuhik balaatkaar kiya
 Hearing the screaming of the girl screaming, some people rushed towards the scene
 unhone vahaan ladki ko besudh pade hue paaya
 The girl was in a state of deep shock and was having seizures
 un logon ne fouran is baat kii soochna pulik ko di or peedita ko tiruvanantpuram medical college aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 Police have registered a case against three people after taking the girl's statement
 police aropiyon kii talash kar rahi he
 So far the accused are out of the reach of the police
 gauratlab he ki is ghatana se kuch hi din pehle ernakulam jile main kanoon kii padhai karne vaali ek dalit chaatra ke saath balaatkaar kiya gaya tha or phir uski hatya kar di gai thi
 The politics of the state was also hot about this incident
 karipur hawaondde par buudhvaar raat us samay ajibo-garib sthiti ban gai jab kendriya audyogic suraksha bal (siaisef) or bhartiya hawaldda praadhikaran ke adhikari ke bich hinsak jhadap ho gai
 While one CISF jawan was killed in this incident, at least three airport personnel were injured
 jaankaree ke mutabik, yah vivaad us samay hua jabasuraksha jaanch ko lekararport athurity ke agnishman vibhaag ke adhikari kaa siaisef ke jawan se vaad-vivaad ho gaya
 After this, there was a scuffle between the two and then they have reached to shoot
 goli lagane se hi jawan kii maut ho gai
 Confirming the death of the CISFK jawan, Kerala Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala said that Additional Director General of Police (north) Shankar Reddy has left for the spot
 malapuram ke police adheekshak bhi ghatnasthal par pahunch gaye hai or siaisef ke javaanon se baatcheet shuru kar di he
 Chennithala said that the passengers coming to Kozhikode are being diverted towards Kochi
 -input bhashaa se When Devi Lal was intent on breaking the VP Singh government in 1990, the famous cartoonist Abu Abraham introduced in his cartoons a bull that is vandalizing in his own shop (on the lines of the English idiom Bull in China Shop)
 main us samay itnaa kanishtha patrkaar tha ki raajnneeti ke galiyaaron main utani pahunch nahin rakhata tha, lekin agar main devilal ko jaanata tha or apane hariyaanvi logon ko bhi jaanata hum to mujhe puraa yakeen he ki unhone iskaa bura nahin mana hoga
 Instead they will be surprised to see what kind of discussion there is
 kisi hariyaanvi ke sabase priy uske maveshi hote hai
 Devi Lal certainly did
 unhen aar
 Venkataraman along with President Estate got a big bungalow at Willingdon Crescent (now Madertresa Crescent) in New Delhi
 devilal ne uske khubasurat garden ko apane sau se adhik maweshiyon ke baade main tabadil kar diya tha
 Whatever it may be, they hardly understood Abu's stance
 or ve veepi singh sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane main lag gaye the
 This story is not remembered only because of a new initiative of the BJP government in Haryana, the cows, bulls, bulls and calves, etc
 have been covered in national headlines
 haryana sarkaar goraksha ke liye ek nayaa kanoon haryana govansh sangrakshan or gosanvardhan vidheyak vidhansabha main paas karwaane ja rahi he (vah bhi nirvirodh)
 The reason is also that the new law is going to create a lot of uproar in the state, where the socio-economic and caste elite fraternity (jat, Brahmin, Baniya) is mostly vegetarian and where Christians are nominal and Muslims are confined to one district Huh
 ab rajya kii police ke paas ham sabaki 'mata' ko kasaaikhane le jane or niryaat karne se rokane ke liye nae kaale kanoon kaa motaa danda hoga
 Actually it is rung and scary
 masalan, agar aap kahin or se laayaa dibbaband bif utpaada apane yahaan rakhte hai, bechate hai yaa khate hai to aapako kisi kii hatya karne se bhi zyada badi sajaa ho sakati he
 If i had been the HR head of a Korean or Japanese company based in or around Gurgaon, i would have asked all my officers to return home and also instructed to completely clean your refrigerator before leaving so that there would be no clue later
 Get gudgaanv main tamaam restaraan, baar or tarah-tarah ke nae paanch sitara hotalon par bhi khanpan ke maamle main fatvon kii tarah paabandiyon kii fehrist lagu ho jaaegi
 Anyway, you find the consumption of beef in Haryana quite low
 yani ab hamaare frij or dianing teble se bhi aparaadh kii bu aa sakati he
 In such a situation, we Haryanvi people will not be known worldwide for cow worship, but, if i say with some fear, it will be known for having a bull-like mind
 phir, is kanoon kaa dilachasp pahalu dekh len
 It protects only indigenous cows
 to, kya jersey par bandish nahin he? or kya kritrim garbhaadhan rakt shudgh karne ke liye ab bhi jaij he?is hafte kii daleel bif khaane ke moulik adhikaar ke bare main yaa bijepi ke raaj main shaakaahaari aatankwaad ke badhane par hi nahin he, jahaan paneer adarsh bhojan hoga
 The country in which, according to the Anthropological Survey report (1993), people of India are 88 percent carnivorous in 4,635 communities, in which we can also be included
 yah daleel bijepi sarkaron ke bemisaal khabtipan ke bare main he jo sushasan ke mahatvapurn muddon se dhyaan hataakar virodhiyon ko jabaan chalaane kaa mauka de rahaa he
 This party, from cows to Christians, iits to ordinances in sensitive laws, mouthful Sadhvi's indecent statement on our voting trends and now a VHP leader's attempt to communalise the 1857 freedom struggle
 na jane kitne aise morche khol rahi he, jisamen isaki apni rajnatik puunji ganvaa dene kaa baari khatra he
 For the time being, Haryana should be discussed because this is the state where the BJP is going astray from its path which it has shown in the whole country
 haryana main gaayon kii ginati hogi, pahchaan ke liye collar (patte) lagaae jaaenge
 i think there will be some new ideas in this matter too
 masalan, cellphone main nirbhaya jaisaa koi ap lagaaya jayega taaki gaayen khatra dekhte hi police control room ko aagaah kar saken
 And old-fashioned excuses will not work, like i thought it is buffalo meat or mutton kebab
 vajah yah ki nae kanoon main haryana main gosht kii jaanch ke liye prayogshaalaayein banengi
 Just think, in a country that does not have a complete system of forensic examination of humans that a year after the death of Sunanda Tharoor, their report is still waiting to come from America, because just last month a DCP of Delhi Police took samples of it Huh
 us desh ke ekarajya main gaushalaayein banengi or ek samoochaa police bal taiyaar kiya jayega, jo aawaara gaayon kii raksha karegaa or kasaaikhanon, dukaanon, gudgaanv ke hotalon se gosht ke namoonon ko ikattha karne ke liye hoga
 a large number of foreigners live in Gurgaon
 yah police 'mataavadh' par exiar bhi darj karegi
 Nobody has such an idea of minimum government and maximum good governance
 desh ke sabase samrudh, teji se shaharikaran kii ore badhate rajya main police kii jarurat to mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadhon, khap panchayat kii jyadatiyon or rampal jaise santon ko kaabo main rakhane ke liye he
 This new law seems ridiculous there
 satta main aakar koi prachaarak kabhi kaamyaab nahin hua he
 Do not apply it to Narendra Modi because his Gujarat record and his promises in 2014 have assured us that while he is still bound by his ideology, he has moved beyond the archaic ideas
 ham abhi bhi yah kayaas hi laga sakate hai ki modi ke takanic or utpaadan aadhaarit vikaas tathaa naukariyon ke vaade par raajnneeti main behad rache-based rajya ne pehali baar bijepi ko chunaa to kisne ek anjaan se prachaarak ko uski gaddi saunp di
 The people there did not negotiate even with the cow to bring the holy RSS to power
 phir bhi satta main aane ke kuch hi maheenon main yah sarkaar wats app ke liye gajab kii prerana ban rahi he
 Apparently, the society there is a smaller and better-connected society, which feeds on its buffaloes, the best species in the world, and by drinking buffalo milk, most of the vegetarian wrestlers, boxers and athletes there are more than the people of the rest of the country
 Collect international medals
 yahi nahin, ye apni gafalton par khub jor se hansanaa bhi jaanate hai
 Perhaps something similar is still going on in his mind
 haryana aakhri gaiyr-bijepi rajya tha, jisane mahaj modi ke naam par sarkaar chalaane ke liye vot diya
 He did not vote for any government like RSS Khap Panchayat
 yahaan kaa samaaj aasthavan hinduon kaa he jahaan sampradayik junun yaa dangon kaa koi khaas itihaas nahin rahaa he
 The RSS there has been considered a pastime of Punjabi 'refugees' settled in the cities after partition
 rajya main arya samaaj andolan kii badi majboot dhara rahi he
 Swami Agnivesh and Adityavesh were elected from the secular parties in 1977
 yahaan kaa arya samaaj shuddhtavaadi he lekin uskaa mukhar izhaar kabhi nahin hota
 Of course, if the RSS intends to create a new laboratory for a campaigner-run Hindu Rashtra, it has chosen the wrong state
 haryana kamobesh ek hindu rajya he
 Actually, we Haryanvi are known for their arrogance, who are not afraid of anyone - Muslim, Christian, American, Chinese, Pakistani, Hindu - and we keep this reputation with our heart
 hamen ek hi baat samuhik rup se sharmasaar hone par majaboor karti he ki ham apni betiyon se acha bartaav nahin karte
 With this, we have reached the bottom of the chart of gender ratio
 hamen acha lagegaa, agar koi hamen is halaat ko badalane main madad kare, samajhaae yaa ham par dabaav daale
 The government we recently elected wants to leave the old pits of caste and feudal loyalties just like that and turn us into a huge cowshed
 hamane abhi koi bharosemand janamat surveykshan nahin dekha he
 But if you have a little understanding of Haryanvi beats, then know that this government has spoiled its good days
 zyaadaatar log bijepi ko vot dene ke liye khud ko kos rahe hai
 No one understands this better than Yogendra Yadav
 isi se haryana main 'aap' ke prasar kii unki bechaini samaj main aati he
 i am still not sure that Haryana is ready to vote for AAP, but it is certain that it wants to show BJP a way out
 modi itane chatur to hai hi ki ve samaj jaaen ki chunavi lahar laut chuki he
 Delhi has stamped this fact
 vahi kyon, maharashtra, jharkhand, jammu-kashmir main bhi party kaa pradarshan uski ummiido se kaaphi kamatar rahaa he jabaki congress ke khunte ukhdane kaa silsilaa thama nahin he
 The next battle is to be held in Bihar
 akaliyon or congress se buree tarah jhallaaye punjab main bhi dilli jaise nattejey aa sakate hai, basharte 'aap' koi svachh chhavi kaa mukhyamantri kaa acha ummidavaar paa jaae, jaise kahen, manpreet badal
 Without a hitch, a massive electoral victory in ten months has started to look very 'normal', just as Rajiv Gandhi's huge victory in 1984 seemed to be modest in a year and a half
 agar modi vaaki bada netaa banane kii ichha rakhte hai to unhen aresas / viechpi ko do-took shabdon main saaf-saaf hidaayat deni hogi
 There is no longer any buyer of marginalized views of RSS / VHP
 vaajapeyi ne unhen darkinar kar diya tha, modi ko unase takkar lene kii jarurat he
 Post-script: The most nonsensical statement this week was of VHP general secretary Surendra Jain (have you heard that name before?)
 hisar ke carch par hamale ko jaij tehraate hue ve kah gaye ki yah tab tak jari rahegaa, jab tak isai dharmaparivartan karaate rahenge, or ki 1857 kaa sangram isaayiyon ke khilaaf dharmayuddh tha
 i would like to hand him a copy of William Dalrymple's book The Last Mughal

 When the battle had reached close to Delhi, there was a chance of Eid
 aise main us fouj ke cmanderon (sabhi musalmaan) ko chintaa sata rahi thi ki govadh kii ghatnaayen unki fouj ko sampradayik aadhaar par baant sakati hai
 Therefore, he asked his cotwals to give a message to people by playing dugdugi that Muslims should not harm cows
 yahi nahin, kotawaalon ne koi mauka na dene ke liye aawaara gaayon ko pakadakar puraani dilli kii kotwali kii suraksha main band kar diya
 Thus, the War of 1857 was a secular war
 bharat ke itihaas main uskaa ek alag sthaan he
 The Special Public Prosecutor, who claimed pressure to take a soft approach towards Hindu accused in the Malegaon blast case investigation, has now expressed his desire to withdraw from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) case
 vishesh sarkari vakil rohinee saliyanne kaha ki maamla vishwaas or siddhanton kaa he, isliye ve NIA se jude sabhi keson se hatana chaahati hai
 He said, 'when allegations have been made, it has become a question of faith for me

 The investigating agency has asked them to be 'soft' towards the accused in this case
 vishesh sarkari vakil rohinee ne kaha tha ki endie sarkaar banane ke baad unhen NIA ke ek adhikari kaa phone aayaa
 When Rohini refused to talk about the case over phone, the officer met him and told him that he should take a soft stand towards the accused
 NIA ne aarope se kiya inkaarbonia ne maalegaanv blast cese se judi vishesh sarkari vakil rohinee salion ke daawey ko galat bataaya
 The NIA issued a two-page explanation Thursday denying the lawyer's allegations, denying that an agency official gave Salian any inappropriate advice
 isamen salion ke is aarope se bhi inkaar kiya gaya he ki unke dwaara dekhe ja rahe maamalon main baadha daalane kaa prayaas kiya gaya tha
 It is worth noting that in 2008, 4 people of Muslim community were killed in the blast during Ramadan in 2008

 a group of Islamic scholars in South India have appealed to Muslims to avoid the sacrifice of cow and bull
 unhone kaha he ki samudaay ke vyapak hit main isse bachaa janaa chahie
 This appeal matters a lot in view of the upcoming eid-ul-azha festival
 in vidwaanon ne kaha he ki musalamaanon ko aaj ke maahaul ko dekhte hue vyaavhaarikta dikhaani chahie
 They should sacrifice the animals whose Shariah has allowed, instead of the cow-bull
 unhone kaha ki isse shanti banaae rakhane main madad milegi or islam kaa sandesh gaiyr muslimon tak pahunchane main koi baadha bhi nahin aegi
 This group of Ulema, who belong to all faiths of Islam, have used social media, meetings, pamphlets and messages given during prayers to spread this message to the people of South India
 is abhiyaan kii aguai karne vaale islamic vidwaan saiyad hossain madani ne kaha, 'hamaara sandesh he ki musalamaanon ko kanoon ko apane haath main nahin lenaa chahie
 The sacrifice of cow and bull should be avoided to maintain peace
 isse islam kaa sandesh dusron tak pahunchane main bhi aasaani hogi
 He reminded that the two sheep were sacrificed by Prophet Hazrat Mohammed on Eid ul Azha
 unhone kaha, 'paigambar hamaare sarvshereshth adarsh hai

 In this way it becomes cheaper
 sabhi ke hisse do, dhai yaa teen hajaar rupee kaa kharch aata he
 If you are a goat or a sheep, you have to spend at least six thousand rupees
 vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki qurbaani apane aap main ferj (anivaary) nahin he
 This is the Sunnah (the work done by the Prophet)
 madani ne kaha, 'allaah kisi par uski haisiyat se zyada boj nahin daalata
 There is full scope to avoid it (by sacrificing the cow)
 khaskar aaj ke maahaul main jab is par kanoonee roak bhi he or sampradayik sauhaard bigadane kaa khatra bhi he
 It is compulsory to distribute a portion of the meat of the sacrifice among the poor
 is par madani ne kaha ki garibon kii madad karne ke kai or tareeke bhi hai
 The Ulema recognized that the sale of cow-meat was linked to the livelihood of many people, but said that the larger interests of the community were far more important
 madani ne kaha, 'fasaad se bachane ke upaay usase kahin behatar hote hai, jisase hamen thodaa bahut phayda hota ho

 Almost satisfied with the constitutional rights, the Election Commission has written this letter to the government in view of the circumstances so that people do not tarnish their image by making baseless allegations on constitutional institutions

 The volcano that slept for years exploded, and then the destruction of America's air spread everywhere
 30 meter tak ooncha lave kaa fawwara foot padaa
 Many cars were lost due to lava fire
 jangalon or sadakon par lava kaa tandav dikhne laga
 Before the eruption in the volcano, there was a shock of a strong earthquake in Hawaii, and after that, three dozen houses were hit by fire
 america ke hawaii main immergency kii ghoshnaa kar di gai
 'kilaeva' wreaks havoc in Hawaii, the most dangerous and most powerful volcano in the world at present
 jo rah rahakar tabaahi machaata he or ab ek baar phir isane aag ugali he
 This volcano is called Kilaeva

 The one who came in front was swamped, his house, shop, farm and Khalian were all swamped by the lava
 pahari or jangal se hote hue jab dadhakta lava is sadak par aayaa to us vakt is car kaa maalik apni jaan bachaane ke liye ise yaheen chhodkar bhaag gaya
 But slowly this lava not only covered it in its fold but also broke the railing and entered the residential areas
 jahaan jahaan lava pahunch rahaa tha, vahaan aag ke bulbule uth rahe the
 The fire of lava emanating from the Lavajavalamukhi blast spread over 4 lakh square feet made the entire area smokeless
 jaankaron ke mutabik ye lava 4 lakh square feet ke daayre tak ye dadhakta lava pahunchaa gaya
 Due to which many houses also came

 Apart from this, a large number of residential people ran away from their homes

 And until it is completely released, the explosions will continue
 lihaaza is dweep par rahane vaale logon kii jaan abhi bhi khatre main hai
 The one who is denying the volcano as a goddess is that the world may be in awe of this explosion, but there are many beliefs in Hawaii regarding these volcanic eruptions
 america jaise desh main bhi log jwalamukhi ko devi kaa darja dete hai
 This is the reason why they put food or some precious things as offerings in front of the lava emanating from this volcano
 lilani stats main jagah jagah aisi chijen rakhi dekhi gayi
 The people of Hawaii call this goddess by the name of Pelé and it is believed that the island of Hawaii was born by the grace of Pelé, the goddess of fire

 On Monday, on the day of Raksha Bandhan, many people tied rakhi to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but the most special among them was Qamar Mohsin Sheikh
 sirf isliye nahin ki vah khaas taur par ahmedabad se pradhanmantri narendra modi ko raakhi baandhne ain, balki isliye ki unka janm pakistan main hua he or vah pichley 23 saalon se lagbhag har saal narendra modi ko raakhi baandh rahi hai
 Qamar Mohsin Sheikh looked quite happy after tying a rakhi to Prime Minister Modi in Delhi's Gujarat Bhavan
 unhone bataaya ki 2 din pehle hi unke paas pradhanmantri karyaalay se phone aayaa tha ki vah dilli aakar pradhanmantri ko raakhi baandh sakati hai
 She says that when she reached the Prime Minister's house on the occasion of Rakshabandhan, there was a huge crowd and she seemed to know whether she could meet the Prime Minister today or not
 lekin vah bataati hai ki modi ji ne jab hamen line main dekha to tatkaal bulaayaa or kaha aajkal to tum tivi main chai ho qamar!qamar kii narendra modi se pehali mulaakaat painting ke silsile main hui, kyonki unke pati painter hai
 Those same people used to come to Delhi
 qamar bataati hai ki usee samay se narendra bhai hamaari madad karte the
 Always used to advise who should meet in connection with painting
 qamar kahati hai ki narendra bhai kalapremi to he hin, painting ke alaava kai or kala main bhi unki bahut ruchi he
 He is also very good at writing and he is also interested in poetry
 wo kahati hai ki jab pehali baar wo log modi se mili, tab aisa to nahin laga tha ki vah pradhanmantri banenge, lekin yah jarur laga tha ki ye aadmi khaas he or bahut hi nek insaan bhi he
 Even at that time his pace of work was similar and he used to work continuously
 pradhanmantri ko raakhi baandhne ke liye kya karnaa hota he? qamar bataati hai ki raakhi se 20-25 din pehle main i-mail bhejti hum ki main rakshabandhan main aana chaahati hum
 But one or two days before, it is known that we have to come
 qamar kahati hai, 'main bhale hi pakistan main janmi hu, lekin apane aap ko khushnaseeb maanati hum ki hindustan main rah rahi hum or ab main puri tarah se hindustani hum
 i do not miss Pakistan at all
 'wo kahati hai, 'main raajnneeti nahin jaanati, lekin mujhe yah lagata he kinarendra bhaijo kar rahe hai desh ke liye vah sabase acha he
 Apart from Rakshabandhan, i did not try to advise him on any other occasion
 unka kahana he ki vivaadaaspad vishyon se vah dur rahati he or pradhanmantri ke saath bhai ke apane rishte ke bich main or kisi cheez ko nahin laana chaahatin

 The Foreign Minister asked the journalists who had reported that the final decision had been taken regarding the series
 videsh mantri ne ye bhi saafe kar diya ki unase series ke bare main koi baat nahin kii gai he

 haalanki 2012-13 main donon deshon ke bich teen vanade match kii series kaa aayojan bharat main hua tha, jo pakistan ne 2-1 se jeeta tha
 Apart from this, the teams of India and Pakistan have only played in the tournament and Asia Cup organized by the ICC

 On the occasion of Republic Day on social media, a photo is very much discussed, that photo shows why Vice President Hamid Ansari did not salute during the Guard of Honor during the parade
 aresas ne yah photo twit kiya he or uparashtrapati ne rashtradhvaj ko salaam kyon nahin kiya
 It is very important to clarify here what the truth is and what the rules of salute say
 kyanki jinhen salaami ke niyam nahin maaloom he wo soshal media main uparashtrapati kii beijjati karne se nahin hichkegein
 According to the rule of salute, "while hoisting the flag, bowing the flag or taking salute during the parade, all the people present there will face the flag and stand in a careful posture and the President (the chief of the three forces) and those present in uniform
 Will salute jab parade ke dauraan aapke saamne se jhanda guzar rahaa ho to vahaan maujuud sabhi log saavdhaan kii mudra main khadey rah sakate hai yaa salaami bhi de sakate hai
 That is, it is not compulsory
 koi bhi ganmaanya vyakti salaami de saktaa he, bhale hi uske sir dhakaa na ho
 
 " to ye he salaami kaa niyam
 However, taking a photo on social media can shatter anyone, but one thing should not be forgotten that Vice President Hamid Ansari is not new
 uparashtrapati ke taur par yah unka doosraa kaarykaal he or wo in niyamon ko acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 He has been a diplomat before this, has been an ambassador in many countries and this is his 8th year as Vice President in the Republic Day parade
 yani kisi par bhi iljaam lagane ke pehle yah tay kar lenaa chahie ki niyam kya kahata he
 People's condolences with the national flag are understandable, but for any Indian to understand that he respects his flag less than you, that person has to be insulted
 vaise ek or photo twitor par chal rahaa he jisamen yah dikh rahaa he ki jab raashtrapati pranab mukherjee major mukund varadarajan kii vidhwaa ko ashok chakra de rahe to pradhanmantri baithe hai
 Here again, let me make it clear that nowhere is written or tradition is that the Prime Minister has to stand
 isliye yahaan pradhanmantri sahi hai, jaise parade ke dauraan uparashtrapati sahi the
 But the problem is that the photo of Vice President Hamid Ansari is trending on social media and not of the Prime Minister
 meraa ye likhane kaa matlab logon ko wo kaayda bataanaa tha, shaayad jin se wo waakif na hon
 By the way, the running of unhealthy debate on social media is the success of this media

 The Central Government and Navy have sought some more time from the High Court in the matter of changing the gender in the Navy to become a woman and then removed from the Navy
 darasal navy main ye apni tarah kaa pehla maamla he
 The Navy is seriously considering the court's advice in which the court asked the naval cellar to consider putting it on some ground duty after changing the gender

 This person has challenged the decision to be fired from the Delhi High Court
 gender change karaane vaala yah vyakti 2010 se navy main karyrat he or iskaa ek baccha bhi he
 In the last hearing, the High Court had said that we cannot interfere in the policy of the Navy, but on humanitarian grounds, the Navy is asked to reconsider the case that after changing the gender, she can be put on ground duty
 Is, for example, if a fighter pilot is injured then he is given a ground job, in this case also the Navy can consider it
 court ne kaha ki agar wo apni gender disorder se judi cheez ko dabaa kar rakhata to vonavy kaa sabase khatarnakadmi sabit ho saktaa tha
 It was better that he had this operation done
 gender change karne se pehle yah vyakti navy main celler ke pad par tainaat tha lekin gender change karne ke baad use navy ne naukari se nikaal diya, jise dilli hycourt main chunauti di gai he
 The Navy, appearing for the Ministry of Defense, said that this person is a victim of gender identity disorder and many other cases of indiscipline are also against him
 kai varsh vah kai baar bina bataae chhuttiyon par lambey vakt tak ke liye chalaa gaya or usne gender change karne kii jaankaree bhi navy ko nahin di
 The Navy said that she was posted as a male cellar but now that she has become a woman after changing the gender, she could not be hired
 is maamle main court main agali sunwaayee 6 disambar ko hogi
