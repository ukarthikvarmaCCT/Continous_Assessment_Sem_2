 He further said that the Shiv Sena chief, Atalji, Advaniji, the hard work that these three have done and sowed the seeds of ideas, have planted seeds in a very adverse situation
 vah kaal sangharsh kaa tha, us samay in netaaon ne rathyatra nikaali, hindutv kaa uccharan hi nahin balki prasar bhi kiya gaya

 Now when the matter is exposed, BMC has been sought to regularize it

 MHADA has built a 12-storey building in the posh area of mumbai suburb
 jabaki e wing main sirf 3, bi or si wing main sirf 2 manzil banane kii ijaajat mili he
 Surprisingly, the charge of this breakup is not on anyone else, but on the government housing agency MHADA

 But in this case, MHADA not only gave land to the proposed housing society friendship of government babus, but also built a building on it, that too illegally

 Anil Galgali has written to the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and BMC Commissioner in this case, demanding the demolition of the illegal floors

 Usually, after building the building, Mhada allots the flat with lottery or on his own terms gives land to the proposed society on which the society itself constructs the building
 lekin is maamle main mhada ne sarkari baabuon kii prastaavit houseing sosayadi maitri ko na sirf jameen di balki us par imaarat bhi banavaa di, wo bhi avaidh tareeke se
 RTI activist Anil Galgali says that MHADA has done this for the first time and all this is the result of collusion of government babus

 According to documents from RTI, the Friendship Society has a total of 84 members and mostly IAS and IPS sitting in government positions

 The comments maitri sosayadi yaa sadasyon kii isamen koi bhoomika nahin he
 Meanwhile, the building is almost ready at a cost of about 36 crores
 sawaal he bina biemasi kii ijaajat ke 12 manjila imaarat kaise or kiski shah par bani he? mhada kaa koi adhikari is sambandh main baat karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Meanwhile, Shiv Sena, who is in the government, has demanded an inquiry into it
 shivasena vidhayak sunil prabhu kaa kahana he ki pure maamle kii jaanch honi chahie or agar galat hua he to doshi afasaron ke khilaaf karrwai bhi honi chahie
 Now after the matter is exposed, MHADA has demanded BMC to regularize it
 hairaani kii baat he ki saal 2013 main tatkaaleen biemasi ayukta ne 10 manjila tak kii ijaajat de di thi lekin baad main use ghataakar e wing kii 3 manzil to bi or si wing kii 2 manzil kar di gai

 In Bigg Boss 13, there is a panic among the contestants these days
 contestants big bos ke sabhi rules ko todakar apane hi niyam bana rahe hai
 The practice of canceling the task has been going on since the beginning of the show
 contestants yaa to niyamon kaa paalan nahin kar rahe yaa phir apane overegressive bihaviour se task ko radd kar dete hai
 We saw something similar during the captivity task in Bigg Boss house in the past
 train task ke liye big bos ne paras chhabda ko sanchaalak banaaya tha
 But instead of following the rules of the Bigg Boss, Paras was putting out the contestants in the captivity task by making his own rules
 sanchaalak paras kisi bhi haal main apni friend mahiraa sharma ko captain bananaa chaahate the, jiske liye wo sari hadein paar karte hue dikhaai die
 What did Gauhar Khan say to Paras Chhabra? Contestants angrily destroyed the task items due to Paras' forced and wrong decisions, after which it was not possible to complete the task and Big Boss had to cancel the task
 sanchaalak banakar paras ke itane biked hone par gauhar khan ne unpar apni bhadaas nikaali he
 Not only this, according to Gauhar, Paras has been the worst operator in the history of Bigg Boss
 Shefali was reprimanded as a sanchalak for just suggesting to Himashi to sit down during a task , I’m s xxrep 6 o waiting for@beingsalmankhanto rip paras apart for being the worst sanchalak in the history of any task ! s xxrep 9 o manipulative , guiding mahira in n out ! Wow !— Gauahar Khan (@gauahar_khan)december 7, 2019gauharne apane twitor handle par likhaa- 'task ke dauraan sanchaalak kii bhoomika main hote hue himanshi ko baithne ke liye kehane par shefali jarivaala ko fatkaar lagaai gai thi
 Now i am waiting for what Salman Khan says to Paras on becoming the worst operator in big's history
 'lekin paras chhabda apni anguli kaa treetment karaane ke liye ghar se baahar ja chuke hai
 Now it will be interesting to see how Salman Khan will react to the activities done by Paras Chhabra in the absence of him

 Rahul Gandhi also took a dig at Prime Minister Modi's comment and asked if all the planes go off the radar screen when it rains in India?

 kuch maheene pehle kapil sharma or sunil grover ke bich hui ladaai ke baad se in donon ke bich manmutav chal rahaa he
 On the return flight from Australia, there was a fierce fight between Kapil and Sunil on the flight and it was reported that in anger Kapil killed Sunil by throwing a shoe
 is samay kapil bangaleru main apana treetment kara rahe hai or is dauraan unhone ek intervyuu main sunil se jhagade par kuch jaruri baaten bhi bataai hai
 In an interview given to Hindustan Times, Kapil said that i believe that there was some problem and i have to pay a big price in future
 lekin us ladaai ko kuch zyada hi badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya gaya
 i was very sad to see that someone wrote that when i could not get food in the flight, i took all this anger away by throwing a shoe at Sunil
 aapako kya lagata he main sach main aisa kar saktaa hum?aise hi chalata rahaa to barbaad ho jayega kapil sharma kaa sho!kapil ne yah mana ki sunil se ladaai ke baad unhone sharaab ko apana saathi bana liya tha, jisaki vajah se unki tabiyat kharaab rahane lagi
 After Sunil left, Ali Asgar and Chandan Prabhakar left the show in the middle, causing a lot of damage to the show's TRP
 uske baad se hi maine sharaab pinaa shuru kar diya
 Kapil further said that if i had brought this thing in front of everyone in time, this misconception would not have come
 media ne meri chuppi kaa galat phayda uthaaya
 Krishna, who will replace Sunil in Kapil's show, has the enmity ended? Explain that Kapil is undergoing Ayurvedic treatment in Bangalore these days
 kapil kaa kahana he ki vah kuch dinon kaa brake le rahe hai
 He will return with the show again after the break
 kapil sharma pichley das saalon se industry main sakriy hai
 They have problems with blood pressure, anxiety and sugar
 inhen sabake ilaaj ke liye ab vah brake par chale gaye hai
 Why Kapil was angry during the flight, Sunil was hit by a shoe, read the full story of the quarrel darasal, match ke dauraan unka ek prashansak suraksha ghere ko todta hua maidan par pahunch gaya, jiske haath main bhartiya tirangaa tha jo maidan ko chune vaala tha

 The Supreme Court has asked the petitioner to make a copy of the petition available to Attorney General KK Venugopal

 The petition has said that amendment in the Representation of People Act should prohibit any candidate from contesting elections in more than one seat

 Now a government committee has exposed the fraud

 It was from here that he managed to leave India

 State Principal Secretary (revenue) Manoj Srivastava submitted a report about this fraud to the state government on 23 October 2011, as the Divisional Commissioner of Bhopal and chairman of the one-member committee
 isamen kaha gaya he, ''gram dharampuri patawaari (ise shyamala hills samajhen) halkaa nan

 Then how did a private company get this land in the most posh area of bhopal? According to the report, "in the current revenue records, this name is recorded in the name of Union Carbide India
" khasra varsh 1974-75 se 78-79 main varsh 76-77 main begum suraiya vagairah ke naam se union carbide kaa naam darj he lekin khasre main parivartan kaa aadhaar yaa namataran panji / aadesh kaa vivaran darj nahin he
 The report said that the registers on which the land was registered in the name of Union Carbide are not in existence, so these registers are not even found in the archives
 ''yah sampurna prashnadhin bhoomi rajya shashan kii thi jis par varsh 1963-64 main kutarchit rachana dwaara nijee naam par darj hui he
 It is recommended that action should be taken under the sections of the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code 1959

 In 1994, the Supreme Court granted Union Carbide Corporation 50

 The corporation sold its Indian subsidiary UCIL (which runs the Bhopal plant) to Eveready Industries

 The rest house was treated as a temporary jail for those people
 isi rest house se anderson bhopal or desh se baahar gaya
 See the reply from Corporation spokesperson Tom F
 Sprick (US) about this fraudulent e-mail, "first of all, please keep in mind that UCIL owned, operated and managed the Bhopal plant and not Near Union Carbide Corporation
 kisi bhi or tarah kaa kayaas lagaana ghor galati hogi
 The rest house was the property of UCIL and not Union Carbide Corporation
 mujhe nahin pataa ki 1998 main jab madhya pradesh sarkaar ne usiil sthal waapas liya to yah rest house bhi waapas liya yaa phir usiiel kii uttaradhikari company eveready industries india limited (iiiel) ke paas is kaa malikana haq he

 The legal cell of Janata Dal Secular (JDS), the party of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda (HD Devegauda), has filed a case against the editor of a newspaper in about half a dozen sections
 inamen kuch gaiyr jamaanti dharaaen bhi shaamil hai
 Vishveshwar Bhatt is the editor of a newspaper called Vishvavani
 unhone shuukravaar ko ek khabar chhaapi ki mukhyamantri kumaraswami (kumaraswamy) ke bete nikhil kumaraswami (nikhil Kumaraswamy) ne chunaav haarane ke baad mysore main nashe kii haalat main kaaphi hangaamaa kiya
 Used profanities against his grandfather Deve Gowda
 jedies kaa kahana he ki yah khabar galat he
 The report, published in Kannada newspaper Vishwavani on Friday 24 May, described how the Deve Gowda family witnessed an infighting after their defeat in the Lok Sabha elections (loksabha Polls 2019)
 akhbaar kii report ke mutabik mandya se chunaav haarane ke baad nikhil kumaraswami mysore ke ek hotel main gaye
 There he drank a lot of alcohol, raped and misbehaved with the hoteliers
 iske baad unhone apane dada devgauda ko phone kiya or unase bhi kaaphi oonchi aawaaj main baat kii
 Accusing him that he did not campaign for Nikhil in the same way as he did for Prajwal in Haasan
 jab hasan main jedies or congress kaaryakarta saath-saath kaam kar sakate hai to mandya main kyon nahin
 Nikhil reminded that you said that it would be a cakewalk for me because of Mandya's seven JDS mlas, one MLC and three ministers
 isi report kii vajah se vishwa vaani akhbaar ke sampadak vishweshwar bhatta ke khilaaf police ne exiaar darj kar lee he
 Whereas the newspaper claims that it has printed the report based on its reporters, people in the hotel and its trusted sources
 vishweshwar bhatta ne kaha ki 'khabar chhapane ke baad kumaraswami ne mujhe kol kiya or bataaya ki pichley 7-8 saalon se nikhil ne pinaa chhod diya he
 i said that according to hotel sources, i printed the news
 har jagah meri maujuudagi zaruri nahin he
 But even before printing, i spoke to my reporter and he also told this news right, then i printed
 shuukravaar ko khabar chhapi
 On Saturday, Kumaraswamy spoke to me on the phone and Nikhil too
 maine agle adishan main safai bhi chhaapi
 And also wrote that my motive was not to tarnish anyone's image
 apane puure karier main maine aisa nahin kiya
 But even before Kumaraswamy appeared in favor, Pradeep Kumar, general secretary of the Janata Dal Secular's Legal Cell in Karnataka, lodged an FIR against Vishveshwar Bhatt at Srirampura police station
 jin dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj hua he unamem ipisi kii dhara 468 bhi shaamil he, yani dhokhadhadi ke iraade se kiya gaya kaam
 Vishveshwar Bhatt said that 'I came to know that a case was registered against me on Sunday and the police turned it into an FIR without investigation
 dhara 406, 420, 468, 499, 506, 504 or 501 ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya he
 Of this, 468 are non-bailable and carry a sentence of up to seven years
 pehali baar mere karier main is tarah kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 'by the way, this is not the only case of recent times when a journalist has suffered such harassment
 isse pehle bijepi ke chimpethaizer or patrkaar hemanth kumaar ko bhi haal hi main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 He is accused of sharing the fake letter of Karnataka Home Minister MB Patil on social media and is currently on bail
 karnataka ke grih mantri embi patil kaa kahana he ki vishweshwar bhatta maamle main bhi kanoon sangat karrwai kii jaaegi
 In fact, the Chief Minister of Karnataka Kumaraswamy is particularly angry with the media
 unka maananaa he ki media sachai kii padtaal kiye bagaiyr khabar chalaata he
 They are mocked through the fluffy cartoons of the leaders
 ye alag baat he ki netaaon ke aacharan par unki aisi koi raay saamne nahin ai he
 Emphasizing friendship between India and China, the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan religious leader, has said that mutual understanding between the two countries is necessary for peace in the region
 apni bhopal yatra ke duusare din aaj subah yahaan samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main dalai lamas ne kaha ki donon hi desh shaktishaalee hai or is kshetra ke liye jaruri he ki ve mil kar rahen
 He said that he does not want to separate Tibet from China, rather he wants the autonomy of Tibet, as well as that he does not want the Chinese constitution to apply there
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki tibet kaa yuva varg use china se alag karnaa chahta he, lekin vah aise logon se sahamat nahin hai
 The Dalai Lama refused to answer political questions related to China, stating that he did not want any of his statements to cause controversy
 jab unase china dwaara pakistan evam bangladesh ke nikat sainya shivi taiyaar karne ke nirnay ke bare main poocha gaya, to unhone kaha ki yah sawaal bharat ke raksha mantralay se kiya janaa chahie
 In response to another question, the religious leader of the Tibetans said that according to his information, about 800 articles have been written in the Chinese media recently, agreeing with his opinion
 dalai lamas yahaan do divasiy yatra par aae the, jiske tahat kal unhone rajya vidhansabha ke sabhagrih main maanavadhikaron’ par kendrit ek vyaakhyaan main hissaa liya or aaj subah patrakaron se baatcheet karne ke baad waapas ravaanaa ho gaye

 a post shared by WE LOVE YOU SALMAN (@rockstarsalmankhan) on May 31, 2018 at 8:54 am PDT uttarakhand ke nae mukhyamantri kal shapath grahan karenge, lekin philhal agar koi baat surkhiyon main hai, to vah hai nae mukhyamantri ke sarkari nivas ko lekar
 The authorized Chief Minister's residence in Uttarakhand is still waiting for his Chief Minister
 mukhyamantri awaas ke bare main myth hai ki jo bhi mukhyamantri yahaan rahane aayaa usne hi apni satta ganvaai
 The subject of curiosity is that will the new Chief Minister stay in this government house built at a cost of around 30 crores or will he walk the path of his former Chief Ministers with superstition? Talking about former Chief Minister Harish Rawat, he had made Bijapur guest house his residence but still could not win the elections
 mukhyamantri harish ravat ise apshaguni maanakar isamen nahin gaye
 Now it remains to be seen whether the new Chief Minister of the state breaks this myth or not? Due to rumors of Vastu defects in the Chief Minister's residence, almost all the former Chief Ministers have avoided staying in it
 sutron ke mutabik sampatti vibhaag ne is bangale ko sanvaarane kaa kaam shuru kar diya hai
 The construction of this Chief Minister's residence started during the tenure of Narayanadatta Tiwari, but the entire work took place in the first term of the then BJP Chief Minister BC Khanduri
 khandudi hi sarvapratham is awaas main rahe, lekin kuch hi samay baad unhen pad se hatana padaa tha
 Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank also could not stay in the post as Chief Minister for a long time
 bhuwan chandra khandudi jab sitambar 2011 main dobaaraa mukhyamantri bane, to kareeb chah maah awaas main rahane ke baad unki sarkaar chunaav main haar gai
 Khanduri herself lost the election from Kotdwar despite being the CM
 iske baad pradesh main congress kii sarkaar bani or iske mukhiya bane vijay bahuguna
 He also got the same Chief Minister's residence and he too could remain in the post for only one year and 11 months
 party ne hi kedarnath aapadaa ke baad unhen pad se chalata kar diya
 However, he became the longest-lived Chief Minister in this residence
 harish ravat bhi apni kursi surakshit rakhane ke liye is mukhyamantri awaas main shift nahin hue, mukhyamantri harish ravat ne apana puraa kaarykaal bijapur guest house main hi bitaayaa
 He never went to this government residence
 haalanki vah bhi 2017 main apni kismat ke sitare nahin badal paae
 The state property department is very upset due to the CM house being lying vacant
 bangale ko banane main karodon kharch hue
 Apart from this, huge amount is being spent on security, maintenance and staffing of the house
 saath hi siem ke liye duusare sthaan par awaas kii vyavastha karne kaa bhaar alag se he
 Now it has to be seen whether the new Chief Minister breaks this myth or not? How long did CM stay in this Chief Minister's residence · Nishank: May 2011 to September 2011 · Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri: September to March 2012 · Vijay Bahuguna March 2012 to January 2014 internet par kuch naam aise hai jo hameshaa acchhee vajahon se hi charchaa main rahete hai, jinke prashansakon kii list kabhi ghatati nahin, sirf badhati hi he

 com / ri7uuitpp5— Sushil Kumar Modi (@sushilmodi)june 27, 2019 The intoxication of the success of Queen is climbing up Kangana's head
 khabar he ki in dinon kangana mineral water se naha rahi hai
 Mineral water is related to his upcoming film 'revolver Rani' or whether Kangana knows this thing to take care of her beauty
 sutron kii maane to kangana ko 'queen' kii safalataa ke liye saraahna ke saath hi moti rakam bhi mili he
 It is heard that regular water supply is not available in their new flat in Khar
 is building ko haal hi main ossie (ocupation certificate) mila he, to ho saktaa he is vajah se bmaisi ko pani kii supplai dene main thodaa vakt lag jaae
 So during this time Kangana has the option of mineral water
 to isse kangana kii pani samasya bhi dur ho rahi he or khud kaa bhi khyaal rakh paa rahi hai
 Why is it not right Kangana? nishchit rup se aap apni car ko mahatv dete honge! apni car ko chalaate hue aapako jo garv or anand kaa anubhav hota he, aapaki apni car jise aapane maheenon ke vichaar-vimarsh, research or bachat ke baad kharida he, uskaa varnan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Therefore, even if there are small scratches on it, you are pained
 usase kahin choti-si bhi takkar lag jaae to aapaki kai raaton kii neend chhin jaati he
 And God forbid, but what happens if your beloved car falls victim to an accident somewhere? So the most important question that arises in your mind is, 'am i taking adequate measures to protect my car?' Car insurance (or motor insurance) is an umbrella that protects both ways - from any undisclosed risk
 Any damage to your car and in the event of an accident
 car ke liye hone vaale beemaa cover main bimit car, bimit party or third parties (duusare vaahan or log) shaamil hote hai
 So the premium one has to pay depends on many things, such as the price of the car, the type of insurance coverage, the classification of the vehicle, etc
 bharat main car beemaa anivaary he
 People generally do not want to go online and read the details and take the trouble of choosing the right car insurance
 aisa lagata he ki yah mahaj ek aupchaarikta he, jise band kar dena chahie, thik he! lekin aapako yah abhas nahin hoga ki yah aapke dwaara ho sakane vaali sabase badi galati sabit ho sakati he
 Here we tell you about 10 such points that you must know about motor insurance, or you will have a fruitless plan while in crisis: 1
 jitna zyada didctible hoga, premium utana hi kam hoga-car beemaa companiyaan apni keemat kaa nirdhaaran is akalan ke aadhaar par karti hai ki kisi aakasmik ghatana kii sthiti main unhen kitna bhugtan karnaa pad saktaa he
 However, if you agree to increase your deductible amount then the amount will be reduced by the insurance company who pays you the claim, so usually companies offer lower premium
 aap yadi didctible kaa bhugtan vahan kar sakate hai tab to thik he, anyathaa is vikalp ko chunane se bachein
 2
 ji haa, aap apane no clem bonus ko transfar kar sakate hai (ncb)-aapane apni car ko apgrade kiya? aap apane sanchit enasibi ko apni nai car main transfar kar sakate hai
 Have you joined the new insurance company? Again you can transfer your existing NCB to a new company's car insurance policy
 yah bahut simpal he!3
 Know about zero depreciation cover - Zero depreciation cover is your safest bet
 is tarah ke beemaa cover main depriciation yani mulya hraas ko shaamil kiye bina purna niptaan kiya jaataa he
 So if your car ever gets hit by an accident, the zero depreciation cover ensures that you do not have to pay anything out of your pocket for the loss caused by it, on the other hand, depreciation is calculated in a normal car insurance
 And this will reduce the amount you get after settlement
 haa, yah sach he ki jiro depriciation cover ke liye premium kisi regular cover ke mukaable zyada hota he, lekin yah aapako hone vaali pareshaaniyon se zyada to nahin?4
 Include your car accessories in insurance cover too! - You might not be aware of this, but many motor insurance companies also include accessories in your car under insurance cover
 yah ek alag tarah kii aid on suvidha he jo aapaki khaas tarah kii accessories ke liye customiod hoti he
 Adding this to your insurance policy definitely increases the premium amount, but in the long run, it is the safest and prudent bet
 5
 Insure the engine as well - Do you know that you have the option to choose an add-on that also provides insurance cover to your engine and saves the expense of repairing your vehicle, which is an accident Doesn't happen Engine repair can be quite expensive, especially when flooding occurs, and this add-on saves you a lot of problems and definitely saves money too! 6
 gaadi kharaab hone / chaabi gum hone par madad? ji haa, aapako iske bare main bhi pataa karnaa hoga! -car beemaa policy na sirf durghatana ke maamalon main, balki aapako kabhi brakedown (gaadi kharaab hone) yaa aapaki chaabi gum jane kii sthati main (aisi vikat sthiti ekaadh baar sabake saath hoti he) bhi madadgaar ho sakati he
 However you will have to see if your car insurance policy has cover for such accidental incidents
 aisa he to on-road repere cover se aapako maikenic hasil karne, gaadi ko to kar le jane, durghatana ke baad repere or yahaan tak ki tair evam tub badalane main bhi madad mil sakati he! locout assistant se aapako car kii chaabi / lock badalane main madad milegi
 For this reason, we call it a comprehensive car insurance scheme
 nishchit rup se is tarah kii beemaa policy aapako hasil kerani chahie
 7
 dealer insurance? aapako iske bare main do baar sochna hoga-aap sabhi tarah ke kagajaat kii jarurat puraa karte hai or bas yah chaahate hai ki apni brands new car lekar drive par nikal jaaen
 Therefore, you take the easy path
 dealer aapako jo bhi ofer karata he, aap vah motor insurance le lete hai
 Ask yourself, is it sensible? Think it would be wise to sign a blank check? You are getting something easily, just because you do not necessarily get the best deal
 isliye aap vinamrata se dealer ko naa bol dijie or khudresearch kariye
 Compare all types of policy, see which policy will be better for you in long term and after that choose your option
 8
 It is not prudent to allow your policy to lapse — insurance companies do not like car owners who do not have motor insurance policies
 aise logon ko gaiyr-jimmedaar mana jaataa he or ve ise ek jokhimpurna nivesh maanati hai
 In such a situation, they protect themselves by charging a higher premium
 apni car beemaa policy ko yadi aapane laps ho jane diya to isaki aapako apane soch se zyada keemat chukaani pad sakati he
 Certainly the new policy you buy will not be affordable
 9
 Bundling of insurance helps - do you live in a large family that has more than one car to share? So you will probably be spending a large amount on total insurance
 aapke liye behatar he ki apni beemaa company se bandald (ikattha) car beemaa yojana bataane ko kahen
 This will help reduce the insurance premium for all your cars and will save you well
 yah smart kadam he na?10
 Insurance premiums vary from one company to another — contrary to popular but misconception, all insurance companies offer different rates
 har beemaa company ke paas jokhim prabandhan kaa ek customij formula hota he jisase use yah nirdhaaran karne main aasaani hoti he ki kawarej ke liye kitna bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Therefore, no two insurance companies have the same price
 isliye aap koi beemaa policy bina daron kii tulana kiye le rahe hai to aapako zyada bhugtan karnaa pad saktaa he
 a good motor insurance policy ensures that you drive leisurely and free from financial worries
 udhaaharan ke liye iffko tokio sarvshereshth motor beemaa policys pesh karti he jinamein vyapak suraksha hasil hoti he
 These policies cover all liability for injuries, death or damage to third party property
 durghatnaon ke alaava, iffko tokio kii beemaa policiyon main dangon, aag, chori, visphot, prakritik aapadaa aadi ke liye beemaa muhaiyaa kiya jaataa he
 Additional benefits such as road assistance in case of car failure, providing duplicate keys in case of missing keys, etc
 are also provided
 to bhala koun nahin chahega ki iffko tokio jaisi ekasampurna policyllen? to puraa samay len, daron kii tulana karen or acchhee tarah se chayan karen
 And yes, do not forget to remember the above points in your mind

 Those soldiers also broke the tents of the local people
 phogiyon ne logon ko dhamkee bhi di ki wo ilaake ko chhodkar chale jaaen
 After all, what China wants, it is very difficult to say what China wants to express with these antics
 naa jane uske man main bharat ko lekar kya he
 Constantly crossing borders, preparing for war in the guise of friendship and continuing to make a presence in the outskirts of India has become the nature of China
 sena sutron kii maane, to chini fouj ne ladakh kii seemaa main kareeb dedh kilometre andar aakar vahaan ke pattharon par laal rang se china likh diya he
 The infiltration took place in Mount Gya area of ladakh
 ye wo ilaaka he jahaan jammu-kashmir, ladakh or lahaul sphiti ke ilaake milte hai
 However, this is not the first time that China has so infiltrated India's border
 teen maheene pehle bhi china ne kii thi ghuspaithtin maheene pehle bhi china ke do em ai helicopteron ne bhartiya vaayu seemaa kaa ulanghan kiya tha
 According to intelligence, these Chinese helicopters were seen flying on June 21 by the residents of Pengang Lake in Leh
 in helicopteron ne kareeb 5 minute tak ilaake main chakkar lagaae or vahaan khaane ke packet bhi giraae the
 According to intelligence information, the infiltration of Chinese army in Leh area has increased considerably in the month of August
 chini gashti dalon ne is maheene 26 baar ghuspaith kii
 Obviously, the Indian government is very concerned about this incursion by the Chinese army
 is mudde par raksha mantralay kii baithak bhi hui
 However, Foreign Minister SM Krishna says that there is no tension between the two countries
 krishna kaa kahana he ki chini ghuspaith par chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he or china ke saath seemaa vivaad par baatcheet jari he
 China does not believe that mcmahon Rekha Kochinta has said that India has tried many times, but so far neither China is trying to understand this nor does it understand the limits of the border
 sawaal ye uthte hai ki vivaad sulajhane kii koshishen bhi kai baar ho chuki hai par abtak koi nateeja nahin niklaa he
 The border that China is repeatedly violating is the mcmahon Line set in the British era
 lekin ye vivaad he ki ajtak thama hi nahin
 China has been continuously pressurizing India
 isi kadi main usne ab tak kaa sabase bada sainik abhyaas bhi kiya he
 The most important thing is that through this exercise, China is also trying to test its strength of rapid military deployment on the Indian border through high speed trains
 china laga he apni takat dikhaane menchin ko lagata he ki wo apni takat bharat par dikhaakar puri duniya ko daraa saktaa he or isliye wo lagaataar laga hua he apni takat dikhaane main
 He is engaged in the siege of India
 iske liye china ne pakadakar rakhi he bharat kii ek kamjor kadi arunachal pradesh kaa tawang ilaaka
 This is the same area where China forcibly took possession after the 1962 war
 us jang ke baad se to china ne arunachal pradesh tak ko apana hi hissaa kahana shuru kar diya
 He has been showing military strength
 ab wo aarthik maamalon main bhi adnge daalane laga he
 China is now trying to stop the financial assistance to India
 asian development bank se milane vaale lone par china ne ye kahkar roak lagane kii koshish kii ki chunki is raashi kaa istemaal arunachal pradesh main hone vaala he or us ilaake main tawang bhi aata he, jo vivaadit he
 This means that he used to bother himself
 ab duusare sansthaanon par dabaav banaakar bhi bharat ko pareshaan karne kii sajeesh jari he

 At the same time, Modi also called the Congress party symbol of the Congress as a bloody paw

 jis tarah kaa sada aayojan medicin scavyar or alphonso arina main hua tha, usee tarah kaa rampur main hua
 The expenses may have been reduced due to Rampur, but the item does not seem to be less than Modi's events, for which Bagdi has been sourced from London
 agar aap yah samajhate hai ki rampur ke logon kaa landan se koi relation nahin he, to aap galat he
 Australia can be from India, so why not Rampur from London
 mulaayam singh yadav landan se laai gai is bagdhi main aise gum rahe hai, jaise rampur main nahin landan ke trefalgar scavyar main gum rahe hai
 The number of times i have seen the man who is running the waggon is that i am not sure whether he is the groom of someone else's procession, who has been brought to run Mulayam's bag for an hour

 The government has decided that henceforth there will be no official political or social events in the stadium
 sarkaar ne ye faisla stadium main shapath grahan le lene ke baad kiya he
 i will just pray that this news does not go abroad, if the governments there put similar restrictions on the stadium, then where will the leader who will challenge Prime Minister Modi in future

 i have full sympathy with the Tanga Gig in UP
 kaash ve apane tamatum ke saath landan main paidaa hue hote, to aaj unhen emport hokar rampur aane kaa mauka miltaa
 If the people of Kolkata's Victoria are sad, they will tell them that you could have come to Rampur

 Mulayam Singh Yadav is 75 years old, so cake has also been ordered for seventy-five kilos

 Intolerance was the most popular word of 2015, and it was also widely used on every platform
 kabhi koi sahityakar bolaa to kabhi koi netaa or kabhi sitare
 Yes, i remember from the stars Amir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan used this word
 desh ke in chahete superstars ne jab kaha ki bharat ashishnu hota ja rahaa he to ekadam se jaise sahishnu logon ke sabar kaa baandh tut gaya or ve ashishnu ho gaye
 Even intolerant like that, absolutely hard to find, and ready to teach a lesson of tolerance to those who use these intolerant words
 ab jab is baat ko thodaa samay guzar chukaa he, to samay bhi aa gaya he ki is ashishnutaa ke effects kaa bhi aankalan kar lenaa chahie
 Shah Rukh Khan: Shah Rukh Khan, the King of Bollywood, in an interview in November 2015 talked about increasing intolerance in India and then there was an uproar
 unhone baat ko rafa-dfa karne kii koshish bhi kii
 When does the talk come out of the mouth
 kuch sanghathanon ne unhen sabak sikhaane kaa bidaa uthaa liya
 On December 18, his film Dilwale was to come, so the message started circulating on whatsapp and it was said that do not watch the film of KESRK
 soshal netwarking cites par bhi samaan raay rakhane vaale bandhu janon ne isi tarah kaa abhiyaan ched diya
 When the film was released, its shows had to be canceled in many places and there was more uproar in many places
 vaise bhi film bedam thi, lekin is sari kavayad ne film par or kutharaghaat kiya
 Very tolerant people created an atmosphere of intolerance for Shahrukh Khan
 aamir khananovember kaa hi maheenaa tha, or aamir ne bhi ashishnutaa kaa raag alapa to phir kya tha
 So the so-called patriots again smiled
 soshal netwarking cites par aamir kaa hi nahin balki un products kaa bahishkaar karne ke liye kaha gaya jinka ve prachaar karte the
 The contract to receive his slap was also given
 phir vah sab hua jo aksar bahut hi sahishnu log ashishnu logon ke khilaaf karte hai
 The masterstroke was left, which has now come to the fore
 aamir khan ko atuly bharat campan ke brands ambeseder ke taur par hataa diya gaya he
 It is being said that his contract was completed
 kisi ko sarkari campan kaa brands ambeseder banane kaa visheshadhikaar sarkaar ke hi paas he
 Honoring this, Aamir too has embraced this decision of the government with great tolerance
 lekin itihaas ban chuke ab in pannon se sabak mil chukaa he ki sahishnu banakar kis tarah se ashishnutaa kaa paath bhi padhaayaa ja saktaa he
 We have seen this repeatedly, not once
 yahaan mahatma gandhi kii in panktiyon “ashishnutaa apane aap main ek tarah kii hinsa he or loktantr kii aatma ke vikaas kii raah kii sabase badi baadha bhi” ko yaad karke hi ashishnutaa ke mudde par bahut hi sahishnutaa ke saath mitti daali ja sakati he

 One thing is clear from these figures that the decisions of the last three years of the Central Government have given them these economic figures today
 in aankadon kaa sidhaa asar agle 2 saal tak arthvyavastha par dikhaai degaa
 According to economic experts, the figures for March 2019 will also be affected by these figures
 jane 2019 main kaise rahengearthik aankadehome lone: sach hoga 'apana ghar' kaa sapanamaujuuda samay main state bank of india 9 fisadi se kam byaaj par home lone de rahi he

 kendra sarkaar garib tabake ke liye prabhavi home lone 4 fisadi karnaa chaahati he(lagbhag 4 fisadi kaa byaaj doirect benefit transfar ke tahat garib aadmi ko dekar
 ) Therefore, it is likely that just before the elections in 2019, the interest rate for the common man in the country will be between 7 and 8 percent

 The spider weaves a net to trap its prey

 It is very difficult to get rid of these insects

 Do you know why this happens? The entire spider web is not adhesive
 vah iskaa kuch hi hissaa chipchipa bunati he
 At the same time, apart from this, the part where the spider itself rests is made of non-sticky material
 isliye vah aasaani se isamen gum leti he
 By the way, the spider devises another idea to avoid getting trapped in his own trap
 vah rojaanaa apane pair kaaphi achche se saaf karti he taaki in par lagi dhul or duusare kan nikal jaaen
 Some scientists believe that the spider's foot is oily, so it does not fall into the trap and keeps moving around in it
 lekin sach yah he ki makadiyon ke paas oil glands (granthiyaan) nahin hote hai
 At the same time some scientists believe that the hair on the legs of the spider has no effect on the viscosity of the webs

 i asked that the grain field runs here? Said yes Bapu walks
 maine us buudhe-bujurg ko poocha ki ann kshetra main aapako khaanaa dete hai? unako khaanaa nahin diya jaataa tha
 But where did i catch the greatness, he said that Bapu, the food of this grain area becomes very sweet, spicy, so we make our bread and eat it
 usne dosha nahin nikaala
 i called the trustees of the institution, said that the staff of this Chitrakoot (named after Bapu's hut) should cook the kitchen, and go home to have food, shame
 lekin aakhri aadmi kii soch, usne kasoor nahin nikaala
 i also count it among these figures of the decade

 From Kama Darshan to Karbala, i have just started Kama Darshan keeping the mind of Tulsi at the center
 main chahta hum ki tulsi ne kaam darshan par jo olerady likh diya he, use centre banaakar 1-2 katha or kahuun
 The reality of Tulsi's work philosophy should not be run away from

 Freedom is not anarchy
 i believe that by holding the root in Indian culture philosophy, branches should also be respected
 patton, tahaniyon or phulon ko bhi
 Indian spiritual philosophy is probably giving so much freedom to read books which you like, which may be good for you, even if you like other religions, take them
 kai majahab hai jo itani swatantraaa nahin de paa rahe hai
 In a sense, this freedom is good, but because of this we get divided, then everyone struggles with the separate groups of his own society over their respective groups
 isane hamaari shakti ksheen kar di he
 So from the root, we climb up, but even if we climb, we start cutting each other's branches

 It turned out to be a symbol of fearlessness

 You also read Ramayana, you will also have your thoughts on Ramayana

 If the farmer talks about Ramayana in his own way, then it is his Ramayana
 granth ke rup main sat koti nahin, vichaar ke rup main
 Not as the size
 to jo vivaadit prasang hai, unhen lekar 2-3 baaten hai mere man main, yaa to jis tarah uske mul srujata the valmiki, yaa tulsi, jin par vah utraa
 Yet if there is some disputed comment in it, it is either interpolation, inserted later
 buddha jo bole, uske baad kehete hai ki unke shadbradon kaa prachaar to 500 saal baad shuru hua
 In these 500 years, what minds have changed
 to ek to yah sambhav he ki mul purush kii kahi hui baat he yaa baad main daal di gai he
 How many things were inserted in our history during British rule
 aaj kitni baaten galat kahi ja rahi hai

 Or the last resort, put aside something which is not relevant in today's age

 What kind of game with no ball! At this time there is a lot of misconduct in the country
 choti-choti baton kaa vivaad
 The exception is going as far as character abuses against each other

 Such comments should be stopped by the pride of the army and the respect of the martyrs

 Indian huge ideas reached all around the earth
 (lekhak jane-maane kathavachak hai) Defense Minister Arun Jaitley has congratulated the scientists and engineers involved in successfully testing a torpedo built with the Scorpene submarine built in the country
 tippaniyan Jaitley continuously tweeted, saying, "congratulations to our scientists and engineers for successfully testing torpedoes from the first Scorpene class submarine built in the country
" ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘swedashanirmit stealth (radar par nahin aanevaali) pranali vaali pandubbi pani ke neeche bhartiya nausena kii kshamta ko badhayegi
 The torpedo was tested recently
 nausena kii ‘pariyojna 75’ ke tahat chah scorpian varg kii pandubbi kaa nirmaan kiya ja rahaa he

 bollywood ke sitare apni chakachaundh or staradam ko chhod jab ghar pahunchate hai, tab agar unke liye koi aadhi raat ko jaag rahaa hota he to wo hota he unka naukar
 a star's life is incomplete without these servants
 phir wo chaahe inkaa driver ho, cook ho yaa phir ghar main kaam karne vaali bai
 These servants take care of every biggest and minor thing of the stars
 lekin jab yahi naukar in bi-toun celibrity ke gusse kaa shikaar hote he tab unhen bura lagata he
 Yes, the truth of these breathtaking faces of Bollywood is revealed to their servants
 apana stress, apana depressant or apni naaraazgi adhiktar ye in naukaron par hi nikalate he
 And not by abusing, but sometimes by beating and stopping the money of these servants, the celebs take out their anger
 bollywood celebs ko sarvice dena kiya bandhajtak ne ismaamle ko or kareeb se jaanane ke liye mumbai sthit kuch maid agenciyon se baat kii or baatchit ke dauraan jo khulaasa hua wo chaunkaane vaala tha
 We spoke to Mohit Yadav, who runs the 'HONEST ENTERPRISES' Made Service in Mumbai and Mohit clearly said that now gradually he has stopped serving Bollywood celebrities
 kyunki wo jab bhi kisi celibrity ke yahaan maid ko bhejte he to celebrity maid ke saath bura bartaav karata he or phir jab ham samajhaate he to hamen hi dhamkee dene lagate he
 Bollywood stars also throw plates on their mouths, the Bollywood stars also told us how celebrities get rid of their contact with big people and make the case go away
 kai baar to jaan se maarane kii bhi dhamkee dete he
 Like Mohit, Abhishek Sable, director of Mumbai's renowned med service 'HAPPY MAID SERVICE', told how he has stopped taking contracts with Bollywood celebrities and now he does not send his meds
 abhishek ne ye bhi bataaya kii kis tarah celibrities dwaara maid ko pratadit kiya jaataa he or unhen samay samay par puraa khaanaa bhi nahin diya jaataa
 If the cook has not cooked well, the plates are thrown on the mouth
 naukaron ke saath gaali-galochader raat tak inaki party chalati he or subah maid ko jaldi jagaa dete he jisase unki neend puri nahin hoti
 Always talk only by abusing saath hi agar ham isamen pahal kar maamle ko nipatna bhi chaahe to naukar par chori kaa aarope laga dete he
 Some celebrities also have a problem with the cast of servants and do not want a servant of the lower caste
 blog main hua ye bada khulhasapako bataa den kihaal hi main BOOK MY BAI ke ko-founder anupam singhl ne ek blog likhaa jisame unhone bataaya kii kis tarah ab tak wo log 30 se 35 celibrities ko maid sarvice prowide kar chuke he jinase se lagbhag 26 celibrities ke yahaan se isaki shikaayat saamne ai he
 Anupam wrote in his blog that how to be physically abused with servants
 unhen maaraa peeta jaataa he or samay par unke paise nahin die jate he
 Many of the stars who have served, there are also famous models and national award winners, in such a situation, when Anupam did not find any solution, he told everything by writing a blog
 philhal celibrities dwaara jis tarah se naukaron ke saath durvyavhaar kii bate saamne aa rahi he use dekh kar to yahi lagata he kii lits camera or ection main jite ye kalakaar apni ghar kii chaar deewari ke bheetar kitne bhayanak he or kis tarah insaaniyat ko sharmasaar kar rahe hai
 Punjab National Bank (PNB) is opening layers one after another over the Mahaghotale
 vahiin, ghotaalaa maamle main pienbi ke karmchaariyon par lagaataar karrwai ho rahi he
 Three people arrested in connection with the alleged fake transaction of Rs 11,400 crore were presented by the CBI in court today
 in teenon par farjivade ko anjaam dene kaa aarope he
 The CBI has sent these three on remand for 14 days from the court
 ab 3 march tak CBI in teenon se kai raaj ugalvaayegi
 Officials said that the agency has detained the then Deputy Manager Gokulnath Shetty (now retired), single window operator Manoj Kharat and Hemant Bhatt in connection with their FIR lodged against Modi, his companies and relative Mehul Choksi on 31 January
 
 saath hi pienbi ke bade adhikariyon ko sivisi ne saman bhi bheja he
 There will be an investigation of Rs 6,498 crore
 In this FIR, eight cases of fake transactions worth about Rs 280 crore have been registered
 lekin bank se aage praapt hui shikayaton ke aadhaar par sibiai ne kaha he ki pehle FIR main ab kareeb 6,498 karod rupee kii raashi kii jaanch kii jaaegi, jo shetty or kharat dwaara kathith taur par farji tareeke se 150 saakh patr (leoyu) jari karne se judi he
 In the scam Congress government, which politician, which political party and which bureaucrat was close to Nirav Modi, a trader in the runaway Modi government, it is not yet clear
 lekin itnaa saaf he ki ye ghotaalaa bagaiyr bade logon kii mileebhagat ke nahin ho saktaa
 At the time when Nirav Modi got lou from Punjab National Bank, there was Manmohan Singh's government and at the time he ran away with thousands of crores, there was Modi government at the center
 jis bank ne lee karj vaapasi kii guarantee, usee ko lagaaya choonaajis bank ne hira kaarobaari neerav modi kii karj vaapasi kii guarantee lee, usee bank ko chuunaa lagaakar wo nau do gyaarah ho gaya or phir bank waalon kaa ronaa dhonaa shuru hua
 On the scam, Punjab National Bank said that this fraud started in 2011
 hamaare hi system ne ise detect karke pataa lagaaya
 As soon as the incident was detected, we investigated and took action against them
 7-8 saal se kya kar rahaa tha bankpunjab neshnal bank apni begunaahi kaa ronaa ro rahaa he lekin sawaal he ki 7-8 saal tak bank kya kar rahaa tha
 The bank says that on January 29, the case was informed to the CBI on their behalf
 30 janvari ko exiaar hui or phir aage kii jaanch shuru hui
 But before the investigation, Nirav Modi had left the country and had fled with his family
 ab congress or bijepi main is baat par ghamaasan machaa he ki ye bhrashtachar or ghotaalaa kiskaa he
 'two officials of one branch did the work', Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Minister Prakash Javadekar have termed it a corruption of Congress
 unhone kaha ki ye congress kaa paap he jise hamane ujagar kiya he
 Here, PNB has clarified that only one branch and two officers of the bank did all this
