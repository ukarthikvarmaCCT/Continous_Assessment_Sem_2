 Muralitharan said that the result of persistent efforts of the Government of India globally is that there has been increasing international concern about the activities of terrorist organizations like Jamaat-ud Dawa, lashkar-e-taiba, jaish-e-mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen
 saath hi muralidharan ne pakistani dharti se jari aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai ko lekar antarrashtriya samudaay se bharat ko mili samarthan par prakaash daalaa
 India's zero tolerance on terrorism, Muralitharan said, "the international community has strongly condemned the Pulwama attack in February 2019
 kai deshon ne pakistan se apane kshetra ko aatankwaad ke liye kisi bhi tarah se istemaal karne kii anumati nahin dene kii baat bhi kahi
 He said that many terrorist organizations and individuals who take refuge in Pakistan and are involved in terrorism against India, have been prosecuted by the United Nations, European Union and other countries
 mantri muralidharan ne kaha, 'bharat ne aatankwaad ke sabhi roopon or abhivyakti kii ninda kii he

 congress ne loksabhaa chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan main deree ko lekar chunaav ayog par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 The opposition says that this delay is being done so that the government can make some announcement before the code of conduct comes into force

 He said we do not keep it, but will get it ordered
 dukandaar ne hamen ek ghante baad aakar maal dekhne ko kah diya
 An hour later, when we arrived, we were shown two samples of Chinese Manjha as a sample
 dukandaar ne sample dikhaa kar kaha ki agar ye pasand he to 14 agast tak thok bhav main mil jayega, lekin uski bhi guarantee nahin
 This means that there is a fear of ban and little effect, but the sale is still going on
 hamane dukandaar se kaha ki 11 agast tak dilaa do, to usne kaha koshish karegaa
 The Kodwardpurani Kites and the largest market of Manj, which is considered to be the biggest market of Chinese Manjh, did not appear in the open market anywhere in Lal Kuan

 The incidents are happening continuously

 Reality check revealed that Manjha is being sold indiscriminately in illegal colonies
 kharidne vaala dukandaar ko sirf 'majboot' code verde kahata he or dukandaar khud hi maajha de detaa he
 Another code is Chinese plastic which is 'plastic'
 chinid maanjha customer ko sidhe nahin diya jaataa, balki kuch der khadaa rakhane ke baad packet main rakhkar unhen diya jaataa he
 So with so many tricks, the sale of Chinese manjhe continues in the capital

 congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi aaj sansad main bhadak gaye
 Leading his team to the Lok Sabha, he reached the Speaker's seat and obstructed the proceedings of the House
 unki maang thi ki desh main badhati hui sampradayik hinsa par turant bahes karai jaae
 He raised his voice twice in a day which is amazing
 unki shah par unke party ke logon ne bhi khub shor machaaya or sarkaar ke virodh main naare lagaae
 Rahul Gandhi also said there that the speaker is being biased
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki is samay desh main kaha ja rahaa he ki sirf ek aadmi kii baat suni ja rahi he
 Rahul's sarcastic and aggressive words are astonishing because usually senior mps do not make such remarks against the Lok Sabha speaker
 ek najar main aisa lagata he ki rahul apni party hi nahin sampurna vipaksh kii aawaaj banane kii cheshtaa kar rahe hai or bijepi ko kadi takkar dene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But if you look carefully, it seems that Rahul Gandhi's eyes are elsewhere
 darasal natwar singh kii kitaab ne unke or sonia gandhi ke netritv par gambhir sawaal uthaae hai
 Natwar Singh had clearly said that there is no fire for politics inside Rahul
 yani unamem vah urja nahin he jo is pad par baithe vyakti main honi chahie
 Not only this, he had even said that politics is not a part time job
 jaahir he jab party ke ek bahut puraane or manje hue netaa aisi baat kahenge to chot lagegi hi
 Rahul Gandhi's leadership was beginning to be questioned and the leaders of the party were commenting on him
 aise main chup baithna rahul gandhi ke liye mushkil tha kyonki isse nehru-gandhi parivaar ke netritv kii kshamta par sawaal uthne lag jate
 And this was also beginning to happen
 chunaav main karaari shikast ke baad party main rahul kii yogyata par hi sawaal uthne lage hai
 The time had come for Rahul to show his ability and his passion
 agar yah avasar vah chookte to tir unke haath se nikal jaataa
 He did the same
 bijepi par hamalaa bolne ke liye unhone spikar ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Those who know how the house works, they also know that there is no standing discussion without giving notice
 phir, desh main sampradayik hinsa main abhi badhotari kahaan hui he? uttar pradesh main yah silsilaa kaaphi samay se chal rahaa he
 Why did not his party demand discussion in the Legislative Assembly? However, it is clear that Rahul Gandhi wants to establish himself as the top leader of the party
 unke raajnneetik jivan ke liye yah astitv kaa sawaal he kyonki chaaron khaane chitt unki party ko uthaane ke liye unhen hi jang ladani hogi
 Now they have neither time nor option
 yah acchhee baat he ki unhone der se hi sahi, morcha sambhaal liya he
 The 150-year-old party needs a militant sailor and Rahul Gandhi has jumped in to play this role

 Would you like to go there? We do not have any heritage in Pakistan
 ham sarkaar se puuchhenge ki ham ambesder ban kar pakistan jaaen yaa nahin
 We do not want what happened to Anupam happens to us

 2006 main bhi vidhayakon ko bachaane kii jugadkarnataka main 2 saal baad ek baar aise halaat bane ki jedies ko apane vidhayakon ko lekar resort janaa padaa
 In 2006, Kumaraswamy, the leader of the party, angered his father HD Deve Gowda and formed a government with the BJP and was staying at a resort in Bengaluru with his supporting mlas
 baad main siddharmaiya sarkaar ke girane ke baad vah vidhayakon ke saath goa main tehre rahe

 To prevent the BJP from forming the government, the Congress and the JDS held their mlas for several days at a resort in Bangalore to protect them

 The Congress had to push the top of the heel to get Ahmed Patel, the veteran leader and very special of Sonia Gandhi, to the Rajya Sabha
 iske liye congress ne apane vidhayak bengalooru bhi bheja, jahaan unhone vidhayakon kii baqayda parade bhi karai

 Wow! Brother! Wow! So much sympathy from Pakistan
 gajab
 Pakistan used scissors so many times in Bajrangi Bhaijaan that it was not known where to breathe
 
 
 ' phir bhi itnaa yaarana
 Have to agree
 ye to ek kalakaar ke hi vash kii baat he
 Only an artist can have such a big heart
 tabhi to baat dil se nikali or jabaan par aa gai, "mujhe ve filmein katai pasand nahin jinamein pakistan ko lekar bura kaha jaataa he
 "but i do not understand one thing, when did Bhaijaan get this knowledge? 1
 kya ye gyaan tab huajab islamabad, lahore or karachi ke film sensor board ne 'pakistani duutavas par ek hamale ke seen' par etraj kiya or use hataanaa padaa
 2
 kya ye gyaan tab huajab sensor board ne bajrangi bhaijan ke 'baar baar jaap' or 'naare' par bhi aapatti jataai or seen hataane pade
 3
 kya ye gyaan tab hua jab 'pakistani bahut maarthe hai' or 'wo pakistani iskaa kya haal karenge' dialog hataane pade

 kisi bhi dushman ke haathon mar jaao lekin un ladakiyon ke haathon mat maranaa varanaa jananath nahin milegi
 This is the latest decree of ISIS leader Baghdadi for his terrorists
 or ye farmaan use isliye jari karnaa padaa kyonki khud bagdadi ke garh main hi ladakiyon ne iesas ke khilaaf hathiyaar uthaa liye hai
 The reason for not getting Jannat is Durvipj i
e
 People Protection Unit in Kurdish language
 vaise to wipije kii shuruyaat kurdishon ke saath-saath aam shahriyon ko iesas ke julmo-sitam se bachaane ke liye hui thi, lekin jab se wipije main ladakiyon ne esaelaar, lmaji or rocket launture jaise aslhe thame, yakeen maniye iesas ke khoonkhaar or beraham aatankwaadiyon kii citti-pitti bhi gum ho gai kyonki in ladakiyon kaa khauf maut ke baad bhi iesas ke aatankwaadiyon kaa peechha karata he
 And the reason is that the terrorists believe that if girls are killed at the hands of them, they will not have any luck in heaven
 ladi fiteron ko banaate hai havas kaa shikaravaise to iesas ne bhi kabhi sir kalam kar, kabhi jinda jala kar or kabhi oonchaaiyon se phenk kar namaaloom kitne logon kii jaan lee he or inamen unke khilaaf ladanevaale faujee bhi shaamil hai, lekin kurdish ladi brigade kii in jambaajon kii maane to ye aatankwadilady fiteronse kuch zyada hi nafrat karte hai or isaki vajah he, vahi jananath main jagah na milane vaali
 In such a situation, whenever the YPJ or a lady fighter of the Kurdish militia gets caught in the clutches of these terrorists, the terrorists not only take her life but also rape her by crossing all the limits of cruelty
 lekin kehete hai na ki maidan-e-jang main kudanevaala maut se nahin darataa, to kuch isi andaaj main ye ladi fiter bhi apane tamaam aslhon ke saath-saath apane paas ek khaas khufia aslha or ek adad goli jarur chhipaakar rakhti he taaki jab darindon ke changul se chhootane kii koi gunjaaish na bache, to isi goli se wo apni jaan lekar khud ko aatankwaadiyon ke saath-saath in saare duniyavi jhamelon se bhi aaazaad kar len
 Girls are taking advantage of the fear that the terrorists fear of being killed at the hands of the girls are the result of the fact that more than 10,000 girls in Iraq and Syria are currently joining ISIS as part of the separate Lady Fighter Brigade
 in brigade main kuch fiter to aisi hai ki jinhone akele sau se zyada aatankwaadiyon ko maar daalaa
 The biggest fear of ISIS terrorists, the Lady Brigade, was laid in August 2014, when ISIS made the mistake of looting and ruining the Yazidi community hiding in the hills of Sinjar in Iraq
 tab se ab tak iraq or syria jaise mulkon main takreeban 10 hajaar ladkiyaan alag-alag ladi fiter brigade kaa hissaa ban kar iesas ke aatankwaadiyon se loha le rahi hai
 In August 2014, when ISIS began to enter Iraq, the Yazidi fraternity, considered among the minorities, found the softest targets of Yazidis
 lihaaja, in aatankwaadiyon ne chun-chun kar yajidiyon ko lootnaa or maarna shuru kar diya
 Fearing the ism's oppression, the Yazidis turned to the hills of Sinjar to save their lives, but ISIS did not leave them there, and about 5,000 people were kidnapped, including women and children
 There was a large number
 yajidi mahilaon ne uthaa liye hathiyaayab yajidiyon ke paas do hi raste the yaa to iesas kii baat maan kar islam kubul karnaa yaa phir tadap-tadap kar maranaa lekin yajidiyon ne ummid nahin chodi or yaheen iesas ke saath yazidiyon ke takaraav ke jis silsile kii shuruyaat hui wo har guzarate din ke saath lagaataar badhati gai
 As the terrorists tortured Yazidi women the most, Yazidi girls did not delay in taking up arms
 rihana ne chhudaae iesas ke chhakkeudhar, iraq se alag syria main bhi julmo-sitam kii kahani kuch aisi hi thi
 There, the Kobanis opened a front against ISIS, and one of these Kobani girls, Rihanna, a slim and slim girl, got rid of such sixes of the terrorists that she became a public figure
 ek mote anumaan ke mutabik iesas ke haathon maare jane se pehle akele isi ladki ne sau se zyada iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ko maut kii neend sula diya tha
 Rihanna's fame can be gauged from the fact that this photo of him holding a gun in his hands, which is a victory sign, was seen millions of times, and also tweeted thousands of times
 lekin ladakiyon ke haathon maare jane ke iesas ke khauf ne jaise mahilaon ko iesas ke khilaaf ladane kaa nayaa hausala de diya
 Immediately, the separate Lady Brigade in both countries started rescuing ISIS sixes
 aise hi brigadon main ek wipije ne to syria main iesas ko uske kabze vaali bahut si jagahon se peeche dhakel diya or saikadon aatankwaadiyon kii jaan lee
 Now the situation is that while getting out of the family's responsibilities, wearing bullet-proof jackets and having terrifying arms in hand, the girls of Lady Brigade have become a world of wonder and surprise, while a common of countries like Syria and Iraq Photo
 syria main kurd ladi fiteron ko apni taraf aata dekhakar hi iesas ke aatankwaadi dum dabaa kar bhaag nikalate hai
 The reason is the same, the terrorists feel that if they are killed by these women somewhere, they will not find a place in heaven
 aise main iesas ke khilaaf maidan-e-jang main ye ladkiyaan ab lagaataar majboot ho rahi hai
 After the bjp's support of the 'dera Sacha Sauda' in the Delhi elections, the Aam Aadmi Party has also got the support of the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid
 jama masjid ke shahi imam ne dilli chunaav main aam aadmi party ko vot karne kii apil kii he
 On Friday, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Ahmed Bukhari appealed to the Muslims of Delhi to vote for the Aam Aadmi Party this time by not voting for the BJP and the Congress
 shahi imam kii is apil se aam aadmi party ko dilli chunaav main phayda mil saktaa he
 However, there was no response from any AAP leader on this appeal of the Shahi Imam
 desh main isse pehle bhi hue kai chunaavon main shahi imam kai partiyon ke saath khadey najar aae hai
 Significantly, in the Lok Sabha elections also, the Shahi Imam appealed to the Muslims of the country to vote for the Congress
 patna main yojit endie kii mega sankalp raily(nda Rally) main pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Modi) ne ek tarah siem nitish kumaar kii tarif kii, to duusari taraf vipakshi dalon par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 PM Modi said that the pace of development has accelerated in Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne bihar ko nai disha di he
 Metro is about to start in Patna
 patna ko smart banane kii disha main kai kadam uthaaye gaye hai
 The situation that brought Bihar out of the country is laudable
 endie kii sarkaar ye sunishchit karne main juty he ki bihar main vikaas kii panchadhaara yani bacchon ko padhai, yuva ko kamai, bujurgon ko dawaai, kisaan ko sinchai or jan-jan kii sunwaayee, ye sunishchit ho
 The NDA government at the Center has made continuous efforts to capture the pace of development that Bihar has captured
 kuch din pehle hi barauni main 30 hazaar karod se adhik kii pariyojnaon kii saugat bihar ko di gai thi
 This was a glimpse of the continuous efforts being made for the development of Bihar
 piem ne kaha ki yahaan gaanv or shaharon kii sadakon ko, yahaan ke neshnal haive kaa chaudeekaran hua he
 The old bridges are being repaired, new flyovers are being constructed
 ye jo lut-khasot thi, wo band karne kii himmat dikhaai he
 PM Modi said that the people of Bihar know very well what has happened in the name of fodder in Bihar
 vipakshi dalon par nishaanaa sadhate hue piem modi ne kaha ki jo garibon kaa chin kar apni dukaan chalaa rahe the, ve chaukeedaar se pareshaan hai
 That is why there is a conspiracy to abuse the watchman
 aap yakeen rakhie, aapkaa chaukeedaar har tareeke se chaukanna he
 Whether the security is for the poor or the country, this watchman and our NDA coalition stands as a wall in front of the evil eyeers of the country
 2014 se lekar ab tak kaa samay desh kii buniyadi suvidhaon ko puraa karne kaa tha or ab 2019 se aage kaa samay, desh ko 21veen sadi main nayi oonchai par pahunchane kaa he
 He said that now India does not remain silent on the sacrifices of its brave soldiers, it chooses to take revenge
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki aapasbhi sakshi hai, hamaare desh kii sakasham sena aatank ko kuchalane main juty he
 Whether it is within the border or outside, what are some people doing within the country at such a time? Instead of boosting the morale of the army of the country, they are doing such things, which are blossoming the face of the enemy
 piem modi ne kaha ki jab aatank kii factory chalaane waalon ke khilaaf ek sur se baat karne kii zarurat thi, tab dilli main 21 partiyaan milakar modi ke khilaaf, centre kii NDA sarkaar ke khilaaf ninda prastaav paarit karne ke liye ikatthi huin thi
 Leaders of opposition parties are doubting the might of our jawans
 jaise in logon ne sargical strike par sawaal uthaaye the, vaise hi ve ab aatanki thikaanon par hue hawaii hamalon kaa saboot maangane lage hai
 They keep doing their politics, Modi will continue to work for development for everyone
 ab nayaa hindustan nai reeti or nai niti ke saath aage bad rahaa he
 In the year 2018, the NITI Aayog had said that India is facing 'the most frightening water crisis in history'
 60 karod logon ko har roj pani kii killat se jujhna pad rahaa he
 About 2 lakh people are dying every year from not getting clean drinking water
 desh ke 75 fisadi makaanon main pani kii supplai nahin he
 It was also warned that by 2030 the water shortage would become more severe
 har duusare vyakti ko pani kii kami hogi
 This will result in a loss of 6 percent in the country's GDP
 2018 main hi vishwa bank ne kaha tha ki pani kii uplabdhta or garibi kaa sidhaa sambandh he
 According to the World Bank, in those cities of the country where ground water is below 8 meters, poverty is 9 to 10 percent more
 niti ayog kii report ke ek saal baad centre sarkaar ne jal shakti naam kaa nayaa mantralay banaaya he
 Its objective is to provide drinking water through pipelines with water conservation and management to every household in rural areas by 2024
 jabaki 2017 main centre sarkaar kaa mishan tha ki vah 2030 tak desh ke har ghar main pipeline ke jariye peyajal pahunchaayegi
 Apart from this, the mission was made in 2009 that by 2017, under the National Rural Drinking Water Scheme (NRDWP), every person in the rural area will be provided pure drinking water
 purana anubhavah planning or vitaran tantra main kamibharat ke niyantrak or mahalekha pareekshak (CAG) ne NRDWP kii audit kii or usne 2018 kii apni report main bataaya ki 2017 tak shuddh peyajal ko logon tak pahunchane kaa jo plan banaaya gaya tha uski yojana or karyanvayan main baari kami thi
 Due to which the target set could not be attained
 is report ke anusaar gramin ilaakon ke sirf 8 fisadi gharon main hi peyajal pahunch paaya
 That too at a rate of just 40 liters per person per day
 2012 se 2017 ke bich desh ke 5
 Drinking water reached 5 percent of the households
 vah bhi 55 litre prati vyakti prati din kii dar se
 It cost Rs 81,168 crore
 gramin ilaakon main pipeline ke jariye sirf 18
 Water could be delivered to 4 percent of the households
 yah tay 50 fisadi ke lakshya se behad kam tha
 Total 16 of the country
 8 pratishat gharon main hi pipeline ke jariye pani pahunchaaya ja sakaa
 While its target was 35 percent
 kaig kii report ke anusaar 17
 Only 4 out of 26 lakh total households
 67 lakh gharon main logon ko pani kii kami jhelni padi
 The main reason behind this was the reduction in ground water, negligence in quality standards, lack of water resources and proper management of supply
 jal sambandhi sabhi yojanaon main 98 fisadi skim main is baat kaa dhyaan nahin rakhaa gaya ki sarphase water kaa upyog kaise karenge
 Everyone was focused on ground water
 isliye bhoojal main kami ai he
 According to the Central Ground Water Board, from 2007 to 2017, 61 percent of the country's wells have reduced water levels
 niti ayog kii 2018 kii report main bhi is baat kaa zikr he ki desh main bhoojal kii kami ek rashtriya sankat ban rahaa he
 Because 60 percent of the states are not taking care of the water level
 is maamle main sabase buree haalat uttar pradesh, bihar, rajasthan, haryana samet kai anya rajyon kii he
 The population of 60 crores of these states is suffering from water shortage
 ganda pani bhi ek badi samasya he, isaki vajah se desh kii 20 fisadi aabaadi biimaar hoti rahati he or desh kii kareeb teen-chauthai jansankhya prabhavit hoti he
 Half of all the districts of the country are either facing shortage of ground water or the problem of dirty water
 kaig kii report ke anusaar NRDWP yojana isliye fail ho gai kyonki unki yojana or vitaran tantra main kami thi
 21 states did not make any plans on water security plan and collective participation
 desh main jal sangrakshan, vitaran or prabandhan par kaam kar rahi agenciyon neshnal drinking water and sanitessan council, state water and sanitessan mishan, state technical agency, sorce finding cameti or block risource centre main samanvay hi nahin he
 Chennai is the biggest example of mismanagement of failed sources of water harvesting, management and distribution schemes
 vahaan nal suukh gaye hai
 Not only this, other parts of Tamil Nadu have also had to face terrible heat and waterfall
 sirf itnaa hi nahin, chennai isse pehle bhi jal sambandhi prakritik aapadaaon se jujh chukaa he
 Such disasters have occurred in Chennai in 1943, 1976, 1985, 1998, 2002, 2005 and 2015
 kaig kii 2017 kii report main yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki renwater harvesting ko lekar bhi yojanaayen vifal raheen hai
 If the government and people of the country did not change their priorities on water, then the prediction of the CAG of NRDWP in 2009 and the NITI Aayog report in 2018 could prove to be true
 NRDWP kaa lakshya tha ki vah shuddh peyajal kii aapurti kii ek tikaoo yojana banaaegi, lekin isamen vah vifal rahi
 In such a situation, the CAG suggested that the plans should include annual action plans and collective participation
 tab jaakar yojanaayen us str tak kaam kar paaengi, jis str par unhen hona chahie
 In the National Water Policy of 2012 and Central Government policies, there have been instructions from time to time on rainwater harvesting, water harvesting, legitimate use of ground water, replenishment of water collections, etc
 bharosemand or upyukt aankaden milane chahiepani kii samasya se ubarne ke liye sabase pehle sabase zyada jaruri he ki hamen bharosemand or upyukt aankaden mili
 It is a big challenge right now
 niti ayog kahata he ki desh main pani ko lekar jo bhi aankade milte hai ve behad simit hai
 The data on domestic and industrial water use is of very poor quality
 data jamaa karne ke tareeke bhi puraane hai
 The major task for the Ministry of Water Power will be to collect reliable and appropriate data, to create an appropriate institutional mechanism to provide pure drinking water to the people
 yojanaon main ection plan or samuhik bhagidaari ko shaamil karaae
 Before Chhath festival, BJP state president Manoj Tiwari had said that even after the festival, MCD and BJP workers will jointly undertake a cleanliness drive of all the Chhath Ghats of Yamuna
 magar dilachasp ye rahaa ki jis sonia vihaar ghat par se BJP pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne is abhiyaan kii baat kahi thi, usee sonia vihaar ghat par saansad sahab ke kehane ke baavjood na MCD se koi karmchaaree aayaa or naa hi koi MCD mashin, aae bhi to mahaj 25 se 30 BJP kaaryakarta
 It was to be said that MCD employees and BJP workers had to clean up on this ghat of Sonia Vihar, but only 25 to 30 workers gathered
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki jab isi ilaake se saansad or pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha tha ki MCD or BJP milakar safai karenge, tab aisa kyon nahi kiya gaya? aakhir kyon sthaneey BJP nigam parshad sushamaa mishra ne MCD karmchaariyon or MCD kii safai saamagree ko ghat par nahi bheja? is par safai main aae BJP purvanchal morcha adhyaksh manish singh ne kaha ki ham pataa karenge ki aakhir MCD is drive main shaamil kyo nahi hui
 The BJP Purvanchal Morcha president also admitted that politics on the Yamuna issue was not right
 kaaryakartaaon ke jor dene par thodi der main shahdara jone kesanca chayaramanpramod gupta maukey par aae or safai abhiyaan main unhone bhi haath aajamaae
 On the question of MCD not joining this cleanliness drive, he said that in a short time our whole team will come and do the cleaning
 magar ajtak team ne vahaan rukkar 45 minute tak intazaar kiya, tab tak vahaan koi bhi MCD kii team nahi ai, ulte jone chayarmen sahab hi maukey se chale gaye
 Apparently, the MCD and BJP are concerned about their political clash in the parliamentary seat of Manoj Tiwari, not the cleaning of Yamuna and the cleanliness statement of its state president, because the filthy Yamuna is testifying that the amber of dirt is undoubtedly scouring its water
 There has been, but this kind of political filth is also the reason for the turbidity of Yamuna

 In such a situation, will the Election Commission's voting in Rajasthan in the last round prove to be a profitable deal for the BJP?

 There is good news for those who like the comedy show of famous comedian and actor Kapil Sharma

 The Kapil Sharma Show will return again, know who will become the stalwarts of their comedy team in this low back show of Planckpil from Kabir Hai Reelonch, it is not revealed yet
 duusari detail bhi saamne nahin aae hai
 It is believed that many of his old colleagues can be seen in Kapil's show
 
 
 
 So this is the real reason behind the closing of Kapil Sharma's show! Will Kapil's show succeed? However after Firangi's failure, the big question is whether Kapil will be able to get back the lost fame from his new show
 darasal, pichley sijan main badi-badi hastiyaan kapil sharma ke sho par najar aati rahi hai
 But will this happen this time too? Saying this is also natural because this year Kapil has canceled shoot on shoot with Shahrukh Khan, Ajay Devgan, Amitabh Bachchan and many stars
 ise lekar kai tarah kii charchaaen huin or kapil sharma ke kaam karne ke andaaj par sawaal uthaa
 Bringing comedy flavor to the show on TV will be a major challenge for not only Kapil but also the makers

 Both Chief Minister Nitish and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) President Lalu Yadav were present at an event organized on the occasion of Sant Ravidas Jayanti
 nitish ne agle saal se sant ravidaas jayanti par sarkari daftaron main avkaash kii bhi ghoshnaa kii
 Both Nitish and Lalu strongly targeted the BJP on this occasion
 lalu ne centre ko chunauti di ki agar himmat he to jaateey janaganana ke aankade prakashit kare
 Lalu said that he is sorry for the fact that he is not in the Lok Sabha today, otherwise he would have challenged the central government and his ministers
 lalu yadav ko chaara ghotaale ke ek maamle main doshi qaraar diya gaya, jis kaaran unke chunaav ladane par pabandi he
 The comments haal main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke varanasi main sant ravidaas jayanti par yojit bhoj main shaamil hone par niti ne vyangy kiya ki in logon kii manuaadi vichaardhaara he or ye log daliton ko peeche le janaa chaahate hai
 Nitish appealed to the Dalit community not to get caught in the bjp's vicious cycle
 nitish ne dalit samudaay ke saamne kaha ki aane vaale dinon main unke 'saat nishchay' ke kriyanvayan se sabase zyada phayda isi samudaay ke logon ko hoga
 He also appealed to come forward in prohibition
 vahiin lalu yadav ne apane puraane lahaze main kaha ki bijepi ke logon ko bharat ke samvidhan se zyada aresas ke samvidhan main vishwaas he or rashtrawaad ke naare kii aad main apni naakaami ko chhipaane kii koshish ho rahi he
 Referring to Kanhaiya Kumar, Lalu said that these people are not traitors, but people of BJP are traitors, because under his rule, Pakistani flags are being hoisted in Srinagar
 nitish or lalu donon ne is maukey par bijepi par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Lalu challenged the Center to publish the data of the ethnic census if it had the courage
 lalu ne kaha ki unhen is baat kaa malaal he ki vah aaj loksabhaa main nahin hai, varanaa centre sarkaar or unke mantriyon ko chunauti dete
 Lalu Yadav was convicted in a fodder scam case due to which he is banned from contesting elections
 tippaniyan The policy satirized when Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended a banquet on Sant Ravidas Jayanti in Varanasi, saying that these people have a Manuvadi ideology and they want to take the Dalits back
 nitish ne dalit samudaay se apil kii ki wo bijepi ke kuchakr main na fansen
 Nitish said in front of the Dalit community that in the coming days, the people of this community will benefit the most from the implementation of his 'seven Determinations'
 unhone saath hi madhnishedh main aage aakar saath dene kii apil kii
 At the same time, Lalu Yadav said that the people of BJP have faith in the Constitution of the RSS more than the Constitution of India and are trying to hide their failure under the cover of the slogan of nationalism
 lalu ne kanhaiya kumaar kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki ye log deshadrohi nahin, balki bijepi ke log deshadrohi hai, kyonki inke shashan main srinagar main pakistani jhande fahraaye ja rahe hai

 2ji spectrum maamle ke mukhya aaropee purv sanchaarmantri e raja ne sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) ko bataaya he ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko nitigat faislon ke bare main jaankaree thi or atarni general jeei vaahnavati unke khilaaf silsilewar asaty bataa rahe hai
 Raja, who could not appear before the JPC in private, said in response to the committee's questionnaire that the Prime Minister and the then Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee were informed about the policy of licensing
 raja ne 17 pannon ke apane note main kaha he ki unke or pradhanmantri ke bich doorsanchaar kshetra se jude anek muddon par 2 november, 2007 ko patr vyavhaar hua tha or uske baad is vishay par vyaktigat rup se bhi donon kii vaarta hui
 He said in his note sent to the JPC on March 13, in these discussions it was agreed that the Minister of Communications and Information Technology would talk to the then External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, as he was chairing the Group of Ministers on vacating spectrum
 raja ne kaha ki atirikt spectrum ke aavanton ke aadhaar maandand, dohari praudyogiki ke vishay or nae licenson ke vishay par unke or mukherjee ke bich disambar, 2007 main baatcheet hui thi
 Giving details of the sequence of events prior to the allocation in January 2008, Raja said that the then Solicitor General Vahanvati was also present during these talks and also had issues before the Telecom Disputes Redressal and Appellate Authority (TDSAT)
 raja ne kaha, jaahir he ki sanchaar or soochna praudyogiki mantri dwaara 26

 2007 ko mananeey pradhanmantri ko bheja gaya patr or kuch nahin balki salisitor general ke bheje gaye note or uske baad unke tathaa videshmantri evam sanchaar va soochna praudyogiki mantri ke bich baatcheet ko sanyukt rup se bheja janaa tha
 Raja took potshots at the statement given by Vahanvati to the JPC that the controversial press release regarding 2G licenses was replaced in 2008 by the former Communications Minister with a different pen at the last minute
 raja ne kaha ki salisitor general ne isi press vijyapti kaa do saal tak alag-alag adaalaton main bachaav kiya or isaki pramanikta par koi sawaal nahin uthaaya
 He said that for the purpose of interacting with Mukherjee, Vahanvati had prepared a note which contained the customer base criteria for additional spectrum allocation, the subject of dual technology, the mode of spectrum allocation and the issue of new telecom licenses
 raja ne vaahnavati ke note kaa hawala dete hue jepisi se kaha, is tarah sarkaar lambit aavednon kii chaanbin ke liye baadhya thi or yadi aavedak yogya paae gaye to pehle
 
 aao

 Was bound to issue license on POW basis
 raja ne kaha ki vaahnavati ke note ke aadhaar par mukherjee ne bhi 26 disambar, 2007 ko apana khud kaa note taiyaar kiya or donon dastavej pradhanmantri ko bheje
 He said that on the same day he too sent a letter to the Prime Minister on the basis of talks with Mukherjee and Vahanvati
 jepisi ke samaksh gavaahi par atarni general ko aade haathon lete hue raja ne kaha ki vaahnavati kaa yah daawa sahi nahin tha ki vah sarkaar ke kisi nitigat faisle main shaamil nahin the
 Vahanvati's note sent to Mukherjee summarized the entire policy of the Department of Telecommunications
 raja ne kaha ki vaahnavati kii yah daleel bekaar or avishwasaneey he ki doorsanchaar vibhaag ne press vijyapti ke saath unase yah jaanane ke liye sampark kiya tha ki kya license ke mudde par kisi adaalat main koi sthagan he
 The DMK MP told the JPC, this factual information was well under the cognizance of the Department of Telecommunications and sg's opinion on the policy was being sought
 ‘sanshodhit press vijyapti ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he’, is vaakya ko file main kab record kiya gaya tha? jepisi ke is vishisht prashn ke jawaab main raja ne kaha ki vaahnavati ko file bheje jane se pehle ise likhaa gaya tha
 Vahanvati said in the JPC that the press note associated with 2G licenses was replaced by Raja with a different pen at the last moment
 raja ne kaha, doorsanchaar vibhaag ke adhikariyon dwaara rakhe gaye note par meri manjuuri or unhen salisitor general kii raay lene kaa nirdesh dene ke baad meraa dhyaan is baat par gaya ki press vijyapti ke masaude kaa antim paragraph file par di gai manjuuri or pradhanmantri ko purv main die ja chuke sandesh ke anuroop nahin tha
 This, he said, would have devised a completely new way of granting licenses
 isliye maine antim paragraph hataa diya or file main bhi yah baat darj kii ki press vijyapti ko sanshodhit swaroop main sweekaar kiya ja rahaa he
 i want to emphasize that my note was written before the file was sent to the Solicitor General
 tippaniyan On the use of a separate pen for the word 'accepted', the king argued that it was entirely a matter of chance that he took one of the many pens placed on his desk to write two sentences
 unhone kaha, is tathy ke aadhaar par jaalsaji yaa managasaint baat rachane kaa itnaa bada daawa karnaa bina kisi kanoon kii samaj ke kiya gaya
 Raja also claimed that Vahanvati had dealt with the issue related to the effect of deleting the press release and its last paragraph in a number of promises in 2008, 2009 in TDSAT, High Court and Supreme Court
 purv mantri ne kaha, or unhone kabhi kahin yah nahin kaha ki yah press vijyapti unke dwaara dekhi gai press vijyapti se alag thi
 On the contrary, he defended the revised press release
 jepisi ke saamne nijeetaur par pesh nahin ho sake raja ne samiti kii prashnawali ke jawaab main kaha he ki pradhanmantri or tatkaaleen videsh mantri pranab mukherjee ko license kii niti ke sambandh main jaankaree di gai thi
 Raja, in his 17-page note, said that he and the Prime Minister had correspondence on several issues related to the telecom sector on November 2, 2007 and after that both of them had a personal discussion on the subject
 unhone jepisi ko 13 march ko bheje apane note main kaha, in charchaaon main yah sahmati bani ki sanchaar or soochna praudyogiki mantri tatkaaleen videshmantri pranab mukherjee se baatcheet karenge, kyonki vah spectrum khaali karne par banaae gaye mantrisamooh kii adhyakshata kar rahe the
 Raja said that there was a discussion between him and Mukherjee in December 2007 on the basis of the allocation criteria for additional spectrum, the subject of dual technology and new licenses
 janvari, 2008 main aavanton kiye jane se pehle ke silsilewar ghatnakram kaa byoraa dete hue raja ne kaha ki tatkaaleen salisitor general vaahnavati bhi in vaartaon ke dauraan maujuud the or doorsanchaar vivaad nivaaran tathaa apili praadhikaran (tidseti) ke saamne bhi ye mudde the
 King said, apparently by the Minister of Communications and Information Technology 26

 The letter sent to the Hon'ble Prime Minister in 2007 was nothing but a note sent by the Solicitor General and then a joint conversation between him and the Foreign Minister and the Minister of Communications and Information Technology
 raja ne vaahnavati dwaara jepisi ke saamne die gaye is bayaan par unhen aade haathon liya ki 2ji licenson ke sambandh main vivaadaaspad press vijyapti ko 2008 main ek alag kalam se purv sanchaar mantri dwaara antim samay main badal diya gaya tha
 Raja said that the Solicitor General defended this press release for two years in different courts and did not question its authenticity
 unhone kaha ki mukherjee se baatcheet ke uddeshy se vaahnavati ne ek note taiyaar kiya tha, jisamen atirikt spectrum aavanton ke liye graahak aadhaar maandand, dohari praudyogiki kaa vishay, spectrum aavanton kaa tarika or nae doorsanchaar licenson kaa mudda tha
 Raja told JPC citing Vahanvati's note, thus the government was obliged to scrutinize pending applications and if the applicants were found to be eligible first

 paao ke aadhaar par license jari karne ke liye baadhya thi
 Raja said that on the basis of Vahanvati's note, Mukherjee also prepared his own note on December 26, 2007 and sent both documents to the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki usee din unhone bhi mukherjee tathaa vaahnavati se baatcheet ke aadhaar par pradhanmantri ko ek patr bheja
 Taking a dig at the Attorney General on the testimony before the JPC, Raja said that Vahanvati's claim that she was not involved in any policy decision of the government was not correct
 mukherjee ko bheje gaye vaahnavati ke note main doorsanchaar vibhaag kii sampurna niti kaa saar tha
 Raja said that Vahanvati's plea is baseless and unreliable that the dot had approached her with a press release to find out if there was any stay in any court on the issue of license
 dramuk saansad ne jepisi ko bataaya, yah tathyaatmak jaankaree bhaleebhanti doorsanchaar vibhaag ke sangyaan main thi or niti par esji kii raay poochi ja rahi thi
 'amended press release is accepted', when was this sentence recorded in the file? In response to this specific question of JPC, Raja said that it was written before the file was sent to Vahanvati
 vaahnavati ne jepisi main kaha tha ki 2ji licenson se jude press note ko raja ne aakhri samay main ek alag kalam se badal diya tha
 Raja said, after getting my approval on the note placed by the dot officials and instructing them to take the opinion of the Solicitor General, the final paragraph of the draft press release was given on file and the Prime Minister was given prior approval
 Was not in line with the message given in unhone kaha, isse license pradaan karne kaa puri tarah nayaa tarika hi izaad ho jaataa
 So i deleted the last paragraph and also recorded in the file that the press release was being accepted in the revised format
 main is baat par jor dena chahta hum ki salisitor general ko file bheje jane se pehle meraa note likhaa gaya tha
 The comments ‘sweekrut’ shabd ke liye alag kalam ke istemaal par raja ne daleel di ki yah puri tarah maukey kii baat thi ki unhone do vaakya likhane ke liye apni mej par rakhe kai saare pen main se ek uthaa liya
 He said, on the basis of this fact, making such a big claim of creating forgery or fabrication was done without understanding any law
 raja ne yah daawa bhi kiya ki vaahnavati press vijyapti or uskaa antim paragraph hataane ke prabhaav se jude mudde se 2008, 2009 main tidseti, ucch nyaayalay or ucchtam nyaayalay main anek vaadon main nipate the
 The former minister said, and he never said, that this press release was different from the press release he saw
 iske vipareet unhone sanshodhit press vijyapti kaa bachaav hi kiya

 notebandi ke faisle se pashchim bengal main sabase zyada raajnneetik bhuuchaal aayaa hua he
 While the Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee are traveling around the country by raising the flag against the Prime Minister on demonetisation, the Imam of a mosque in Kolkata accused the Prime Minister of cheating people and shaved his head
 Issued a fatwa giving a reward of 25 lakh rupees to the blacksmith
 yahaan notebandi kii raajnneeti par bhaajapa or tiemasi dwaara ek-duusare ke khilaaf police main maamle darj karwaae gaye hai
 Let me tell you that on Saturday, Shahi Imam Syed Mohammad Nurur Rahman Barkati of Kolkata's Tipu Sultan Mosque while speaking at an event said that the Prime Minister has cheated the common people of the country in the name of demonetisation
 isse logon ko badi baari pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Therefore, the common man of the country does not want Narendra Modi to remain the Prime Minister of the country
 shahi imam ne kaha ki moulana, sufi, sikh yaa phir sant hi dadhi rakhte hai or janhit ke kaam karte hai, lekin pradhanmantri keval logon ko thagne ke liye dadhi rakhte hai
 The special thing is that at the time when the Imam was issuing this fatwa, Trinamool Congress MP Idrish Ali was sitting on the seat with him
 bhaajapa ne is fatbe par palatwaar karte hue imam kii giraftaar kii maang kii he
 a report against the Imam has also been lodged in the police by party workers in this regard
 pashchim bengal ke bhaajapa pramukh siddharth nath singh ne mukhyamantri se imam ko giraftaar karne kii maang kii he
 In the criticism after the fatwa, MP Idrish Ali, who refused to apologize on the fatwa of the Shahi Imam, said why should he apologize on the fatwa, 125 people standing in lines during demonetisation died and many regret on behalf of the Prime Minister Not done till idrish ne kaha, 'fatwa apni jagah he, mujhe isse kisi bhi tarah kaa dar nahin he
 And what have i done about the police report? 
 ' lekin, bhaajapa is maukey par tiemasi par hamalaa karne kaa koi mauka chuknaa nahin chaahati
 BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha called journalists on the issue and said that the Chief Minister is behind this fatwa

 Virat Kohli batted with restraint against Pakistan and Sri Lanka and brought the team out of trouble

 The ministry said that the culprits of Pathankot terror attack will be negotiated only after action from Pakistan
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa vikaas swaroop ne press conference karke kaha, 'gend ab pakistan ke paale main he
 The Pathankot attack has brought back the rising incidents of terrorism from across the border, '' he said, adding that the Government of India policy on Pakistan is clear
 bharat, pakistan samet apane sabhi padosi mulkon se dostana sambandh chahta he lekin aatankwaad kisi bhi tarah bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 On the way to negotiate the attack in Pathankot, Badhavikas Swaroop said, 'however it is too early to say more on this issue
 ' unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke lahore daure sebharat-pakistan ke rishton menek nai ummid jaagi he
 Modi's surprise visit was a positive sign for the bilateral talks, but the terrorist attack in Pathankot became an obstacle in this negotiation
 bharat ne kii handlers kii pahchaanasutron ke mutabik, pathankot hamale kii puri sajeesh pakistan ke punjab sthit markaj main rachi gai thi
 India has identified those handlers who were directing the terrorists while sitting in Pakistan
 inaki pahchaan moulana ashfak ahamed, hafiz abdul shakur, kasim jaan or mem ajahar ke taur par hui he
 'investigation into the matter is going on', Punjab Range BSF DIG said that it is too early to say anything in this matter
 maamle kii jaanch jari he
 He said that it is not right to question the character of SP Salvinder Singh
 ek baar maamle kii jaanch puri ho jaae uske baad hi koi bayaan jari kiya jayega
 The operation lasted for four days
 At 6:30 am on January 2, six terrorists attacked the Airforce base in Pathankot, Punjab
 lagaataar chaar dinon tak chale oparation ke baad surakshabalon ne 6 aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraaya
 During this time 7 soldiers were martyred while many were injured
 aatankvaadiarbase main rakhe vimaanon ko nuksaan pahunchane ke makasad ke aae the
 The Government of India gave the Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar to the PAK, also indicated the Pakistani hand behind the attack on the Air Force base
 saath hi bharat sarkaar ne hamale ke taar pakistan se jude hone ke saboot bhi vahaan kii sarkaar ko saunpe hai
 When pockets are loose, they bring the good ones to the line
 varna sochie, vahi sadaken, vahi gaadiyaan, vahi laal batti, vahi helmet vahi set belt vahi trephic ke niyam
 But what changed the color and size of the little notes, everything changed
 sadakon par khauf pasar gaya
 People started looking for rcs, licenses, insurance and pollution certificates of their vehicles
 laal batti ko nihaar-nihaar kar uske hari hone kaa intjaar muskura kar karne lage
 But yes, in many places dard-e-challan was such a spill that every glimpse of it became a glimpse
 pichley kuch dinon se achaanak hindustan kii sadakon par ek ajeeb si udaasi chai hui he
 The romanticism of the roads has been lost somewhere
 naa gadiyon ke horn kii wo awaz kaanon main sur-taal ched rahi hai
 Neither does she take the beautiful force of bikers, but she is able to cool the eyes
 helmet kii giraft main aakar kamabakht zulfen bhi hawa main kahaan laharaa paa rahi hai
 Like two of us slogans from our two wheelers
 teen-chaar saath-saath baithne vaale dost-parivaar ab hisson or kishton main gum rahe hai
 The speed has become like a Formula One race happening twice or four times a year
 ab tak kameez kii kries kharaab kar dene yaa pet ke upar aa jane vaale seat belt kii ruthi kismat bhi achaanak maano jaag uthi he
 And even now, even when drunk, you do not know who i am, instead of remembering only the complete and incomplete papers lying in the car
 dehshat or vahshat kaa alam ye he ki kai jagah to log apane-apane hisaab se bike or scooter ko bhi cycle bana de rahe hai
 Here, the policemen holding the receipt of the challan appeared, quickly got down from the two wheeler and started moving on foot
 ab police bhi kya kare
 There is an invoice for driving without a helmet bike or scooter
 magar bike yaa scooter ke saath paidal chalate koi chaalaan nahin he
 Overall, the condition of Gulzar, which lived up to ten days ago, is no longer in good condition
 das-das baar soch kar log sadakon par apni gadiyon, scooter yaa bike ko utaar rahe hai
 The distant eyes already bury at a distance
 pataa nahin kis chauraahey, nukkad yaa sadak kinare se achaanak wo cham se aa jaaen
 Scared of their arrival
 kyonki unke aane kaa matlab puure maheene kaa bajet janaa he
 Holding the receipt of the challan in the hands, they now look as if they are enemies across the border
 jaise hi unke hathe chadhe, kaat daalenge chaalaan
 Do not remember any such polling center in the country has ever had such a queue of vehicles
 shuru-shuru main jab sienji aayaa tha, tab petrol pump par shaayad aisi bheed hoti thi
 But as soon as people came to know that apart from fearful driving license, RC and insurance, there is a challan of up to ten thousand even if there is no pollution certificate, every vehicle turned its direction here
 vaise log karen bhi to kya
 Up to twenty-thirty-forty-fifty-sixty thousand invoices had not been heard until ten days ago
 phir apane yahaan second hand kaa bhi he
 Now, for those who have bought a second hand car for 15-25 fifty thousand and if the challan is deducted more than that, then it is better to fill the challan and set the car on fire
 jitne kii gaadi nahin usase zyada chaalaan dena kahaan kii akalmandi he
 This is exactly what a young man in Delhi did
 khud hi apni bike ko aag ke hawaale kar diya
 Traffic got jammed
 damakal kii gaadi bulani padi
 Someone lost with a helmet
 to koi adhure qaagazon kaa maaraa he
 If someone's life was red lighted, then someone's drug challan took off the entire month's hangover
 vaise badali-badali si or udhaas nazar aa rahi sadakon ne kuch logon ko achaanak beshumaar khushiyaan bhi ata kar di hai
 Suddenly, the number of white uniformed humans on the streets has increased
 garmi or umas ke baavjood unke chehron par ek ajeeb se tej chamak dikhaai dene lagi he
 People have even started saying that in the press language, the new motor law has brought an eighth pay scale for them

 party netaa kohli ne kaha ki pakistani jhande laharaana or pakistan samarthak naare lagaana kashmir main rosemara kii cheez ho gai he jise bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He said, 'they are forgetting that India is one from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and no anti-national work will be done on this land
 ' kohli ne kaha, 'ham saansadon se is tarah kii raashtra virdohi gatividhiyon se nipatane ke liye kade kanoon banane kii apil karte hai
 It should be seen as a heinous crime equivalent to murder and should be given the death penalty for such acts
 'kashmir main log pakistan kaa jhanda fahraate rahenge: gilanidusri orkatterpanthi hurriyat conferencene kaha ki log kashmir main uski reliyon main pakistani jhande fahraate rahenge
 "pakistani flags have been hoisted (in Kashmir) and Inshallah will be hoisted in future too, because Pakistan is our neighbor and well-wisher," Gilani said at a function at his residence
 'is varsh 15 april se kashmir main kai algaavvaadi reliyon mempakistani jhandexhraaye gaye, jis par vipakshi dalon ne rajya sarkaar kii kadi aalochana kii
 The first incident occurred on 15 April when Pakistani flags were hoisted at a rally organized by Hurriyat to welcome Geelani on his return from Delhi
 rajya sarkaar ne iske jawaab main masarrat alam ko giraftaar kar liya or us par lok suraksha kanoon ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya
 Gilani said that the people of Kashmir did not want India's bad but 'made the country their god

 No one can understand the reason for starting this new Twitter handle, @myogiadityanath
 log soch rahe hai ki jab pehle se unka twitor acount @yogi_adityanath naam se tha to aakhir yogi ko ye nayaa acount kyon shuru karnaa padaa
 careful! Yogi ji is at work, suddenly arrives at the police station and says that he wants to change the law in UP
 The image says that after becoming the CM of UP, he is getting advice to change his image
 ye us disha main uthaaya gaya pehla kadam ho saktaa he
 Significantly, Yogi had an old Twitter account before becoming CM of Uttar Pradesh
 twitor yugers kaa daawa he ki is acount par yogi ne kai aise twit kiye the, jo vivaadit rahe the
 Since it was a difficult task to selectively delete them, this new account has been started
 yogi ke puraane acount ko ab acces nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Still the old image on the website, although CM Yogi's website is saying something else
 isamen yogi kii chhavi or unke lekhon par daaliye ek najar-sabakaa saath sabakaa vikasunki siem ection mod main hai or ve har roj kuch aise kaam kar rahe hai jo surkhiyon main he, isliye bhi unhen ab ekan nae twitor acount kii jarurat mahasoos ho rahi thi
 In fact, this was necessary to break his staunch Hindutva image
 par lagata he jald hi unhen apni website main kaaphi kuch badlaav kii jarurat mahasoos hogi
