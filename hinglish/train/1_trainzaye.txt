 There are more than 50 sugar mills in Western Maharashtra and Marathwada, but not a single sugar mill owner has fixed the sugarcane prices so far
 ganna kisaan 2700 rupee pehali kist kii maang kar rahe hai jabaki shevgaon or paithan ilaakon main kisaan ganne kii fasal kaa 3100 rupee pratiton daam chaahate hai
 Mill owners scramble the quantity of sugar in sugarcane: Kisan-sugar mill owners say that except Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur, sugarcane in the rest of the state has less sugar and sugarcane with eight and a half percent sugar
 a reasonable price of Rs 2100 per ton for the crop
 vahiin kisaanon kaa aarope he ki chini mil maalik ganne main chini kii maatra ke pramaan main dhaandhlee karte hai
 Overall, the farmers say that the price of sugarcane and sugarcane products from sugar mill such as alcohol, electricity, bagasse, raw material of alcohol (cucumber) and others are very high
 isliye mil maalikon ko 3100 rupee prati ton daam dena chahie
 Government's intervention necessary Self-respecting Shetkari organization alleges that it is necessary for the government to intervene in this matter, but the government is ignoring the matter
 is saal maharashtra main bees hajaar karod rupee mulya kaa ganna chini milo ko ke paas hoga
 Which means 700 lakh tonnes of sugarcane farmers have grown
 desh main uttar pradesh ke baad maharashtra sabase zyada ganne kii fasal kaa utpaadan karata he

 If you have a smartphone from Xiaomi then there is a shocking news for you
 aapako bataa den ki samsung, shaomi, achatisi or van plus jaise smartphone custom oparating system dete hai
 Like Xiaomi's MIUI OS, it is a mobile operating system built on Android
 ise technical terminology main custom rom bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 In this custom OS, the company gives many bloatware i
e
 pre-loaded apps on its behalf
 inamen se kuch aap hataa sakate hai lekin kuch eps ko aap chaah kar bhi nahin hataa sakate
 An app through which hackers can access your mobile is a computer science student from the Netherlands and securityexpert launched an investigation to find out the motive behind the app given by the company in its Xiaomi Mi4 smartphone
 unke mutabik is ap kaa naam analyticscore
 apk and it runs all day in the background of the smartphone
 ise delit karne ke baad phir se dikhne lagata he
 Significantly, Chinese smartphone giant Shaom has been accused of installing malware with smartphones in the past and the company has also been criticized
 company ne bhi is ap ke bare main kuch nahin bataaya hecompany ke saport foram par jab us chaatr ne analyticscore ke bare main poocha to iske bare main unhe koi jaankaree nahin di gai
 They found that this app connects to the company's official server every 24 hours for new updates
 sarwar se conect ho kar yah ap smartphone kii identification information company ke sarwar tak bhejtaa he
 This includes critical information such as IMEI, model number, MAC address, package name, and signature
 nae apadet milane ke saath hi Analytics
 This app named apk is downloaded in the smartphone itself, for which it does not need your permission
 yugers uthaa rahaa rahe hai gambhir sawaalcompany kii aadhikarik website par kai yugers ne likhaa he ki yah ap delit nahin hota
 Apart from this, users have also asked the company, what is its work and why it is in the smartphone, but at the moment no answer has been given here
 yugers yahaan company se khaase naaraaz dikh rahe hai kai sawaal bhi uthaa rahe hai
 Users may have this disadvantage: Hackers can replace the update package with their specific app
 export ke mutabik yah Analytic
 The apk app does not check the validity of the source being downloaded, ie it can be a good way for hackers to break into your device
 research kaa maananaa he ki yah aapke smartphone ke pichley daravaaje yani balldor kii tarah kaam kar saktaa he
 Hackers can misuse your smartphone through this
 unka maananaa he ki shaomi bhi iske jariye aapse judi ahm jaankariyaan le hasil kar sakati he
 Researcher believes that even after doing a lot of research about this app and collecting information about it from Google, it is difficult to understand why it is in a smartphone
 company ne bhi iske bare main kuch bhi bataane se parhez kiya he to sawaal or bhi gambhir ho jate hai
 Is Xiaomi doing this intentionally? You can also check your Xiaomi smartphone, if you see an app with this name, then tell us in the comment box

 In 2010, he built a house in the neighborhood of Shakuntala and from that both came close
 san 2011 main shakuntla kii shaadi samalkha ke ravi se kara di gai, lekin shakuntla shaadi ke baad se hi apane maayke main zyada rahane lagi
 He prepares Kamal to kill Ravi

 In the name of development in Rajasthan, about 150 temples have been removed in the last four years, but the wall of a small temple created an uproar
 aanan-fanan main sarkaar ke aadesh kaa paalan nahin karne vaale ipies adhikari espi sahab samet teen adhikariyon ko hataaya gaya he
 In fact, the temple whose wall was demolished was the Gorakhnath temple, which Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath himself wrote a letter to the Rajasthan government to not break it
 jaipur ke sanganer main sadak kinare bana ye mandir dikhne main to chota he, lekin isaki diwaar todane par bavaal much gaya he
 Several hundred years old temples were removed in Jaipur in the name of Metro and there was a lot of uproar, but what happened on the wall of Gorakhnathmandir did not happen before
 darasal 26 farvari ko jaipur vikaas praadhikaran ke adhikariyon ne is mandir ke kuch hisse ko atikaraman maanate hue tod diya tha , lekin jab ye baat upi kemukhyamantri yogi adityanathke daftar tak pahunchi to hangaamaa ho gaya
 The Chief Secretary of Rajasthan sought the report and the Collector, from Commissioner to JDA Commissioner, went round the night to the office of Chief Minister of Rajasthan Vasundhara Raje to give clarification
 aanan-fanan main espi rahul jain ko pad se hataakar apio (awating posting order) kar diya or enforcement adhikari narendra kheechad or tehseeldaar rekha yadav ko jedie se relive kar hataa diya
 If sources are to be believed, many more officers will also be removed
 mandir ke pujari ram singh ne bataaya ki khud yogi adityanath ne ise nahin hataane ke liye chitthee likhi thi or ab bhi hangaamaa isliye machaa he kyonki hamane saare maamle kii shikaayat adityanath se kii thi, jiske baad adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki ham ise phir se bana denge
 This temple has been here for 40 years
 bijepi vidhayakagyandev ahuja kaa kahana he ki apio karne or hataane se kaam nahin chalegaa balki in adhikariyon ko sajaa milani chahie taaki aage se koi mandir nahin tode, jabaki aresas se jude padaadhikari baaki adhikariyon ke khilaaf bhi karrwai kii maang kar rahe hai
 Significantly, on August 2017, the government had ordered the temple administration to remove the encroachment up to 20 feet from the road, but action was stopped after the letter of MP Adityanath, but on 4 January 2018, the temple was again restored in this case
 The notice was given
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki hamane mandir nahin todaa he, balki vahaan chal rahi dukaan ko todaa he
 At the same time, on this matter, the government says that removing officers is a routine process and should not be associated with UP Chief Minister Adityanath

 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar left his rebel nephew Ajit on September 28 after a 'family meeting' at his Mumbai home for nearly an hour and a half, and this has hardly happened before
 ajit ne ek din pehle baraamati se party vidhayak pad se istipha de diya tha
 It is said that he took this decision without consulting anyone in the party
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki ajit kaa makasad maharashtra rajya sahakaari bank main fund kii herapheri ke maamle main pravartan nideshaalay dwaara sharad pavaar ke khilaaf jaanch kaa aadesh die jane ke baad mili sahanubhuti ko palitha lagaana tha
 Ajit's latest move is a major setback for Pawar, who is already upset with the large-scale leaders leaving the NCP and joining the BJP and Shiv Sena
 chintaa isliye he kyonki yah sab tab ho rahaa he jab rajya main vidhansabha chunaavon kii taarikh tak ghoshit ho chuki he
 Sharad Pawar reluctantly proposed for Ajit's elder son Parth to give up his seat in the May Lok Sabha elections and Parth was advised not to contest by the Maval seat, which his father Ajit had asked for his son
 Was chosen bade pavaar kaa tark tha ki yah seat pichley 50 varsh se bhaajapa or shivasena ke paas he isliye parth ko vahaan se nahin laduya chahie lekin kisi ne unki na suni
 Parth was defeated by Srirang Barne of Shiv Sena by 2,16,000 votes
 rakanpa ke ek sutara ne daawa kiya ki parth ke haarane ke baad sharad pavaar ne ajit kii upeksha shuru kar di
 He gave two OBC leaders, Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Dhananjay Munde and Lok Sabha member from Shirur Dr
 amol kolhe ko badhaava dena shuru kiya
 Both of them led the ncp's Shiv Suraj Yatra against the perceived misrule of the bjp-shiv Sena government
 pavaar ne kathith taur par ajit ko yatra kii yojana se alag rakhaa
 The Ajit Pawar camp is also said to be very unhappy with Pawar's brother Appasaheb's grandson Rohit coming forward
 rohit ko is baar karjat-jamkhed vidhansabha kshetra se tikat milane kii sambhaavna he
 Ajit's resignation has now shaken Pawar as well
 rakanpa supremeo ne 27 sitambar ko pune main press conference main sweekaar kiya ki ajit ne unhen apane faisle ke bare main na to pehle se bataaya tha or na hi unase salaah lee thi
 Pawar said on Ajit's resignation that he had no business with the bank scam, yet the ED lodged an FIR against him (pawar)
 ajit isi baat se naaraaz the or apana virodh darj karaane ke liye unhone istipha diya he
 Pawar said, "ajit believes that i am being targeted only because i am his uncle
" isse vah baichaiyn ho gaye
 Ajit repeated the same after meeting Pawar
 unhone kaha, ''ise bahut badha-chadhaakar 25,000 karod rupye bataaya ja rahaa he
 This is an attempt to tarnish my image
 ''rajnatik vishleshak hemanth desai kehete hai ki philhal, chachaa or bhattije donon ne ek-ek kadam peeche le liya he
 There is no doubt that Ajit's resignation is a setback for Pawar, even though he does not want it to be revealed

 rudra or shiv paryaayavachi shabd hai, rudra shiv kaa prachand rup he
 By the grace of Shiva, all planets destroy all obstacles and all problems
 shiv kii krupa praapt karne ke liye shivlinga par mantron ke saath vishesh vasteen arpit kii jaati hai, is paddati ko rudrabhishek kaha jaataa he
 In this, the mantras of Rudraashtadhyayi of Shukla Yajurveda are recited
 sawan main rudrabhishek karnaa or bhi shubh hota he
 Soon the wishes are fulfilled by this
 iske alaava ksht kii sthiti main or grahon kii pidaa ko dur karne ke liye rudrabhishek amogh hota he
 What is the right way to do Rudrabhishek on Shivling? - Rudrabhishek on Shivling of temple is quite good
 - iske alaava ghar main parthiv shivlinga par bhi abhishek kar sakate hai- ghar se zyada mandir main, isse zyada nadi tat par or isse zyada parvaton par faldaayi hota he
 - In the absence of Shivling, the thumb can also be considered as Shivalinga and its consecration and worship can be done
 kis padaarth se abhishek karne se kya fal miltaa he?-- ghi kii dhara se abhishek se vansh kaa vistaar hota he
 - Abhishek from Ikshuras fulfills the desires, Duryoga is destroyed - By consecration from sugar mixed milk, the person becomes a scholar
 - shahad se abhishek se puraani se puraani bimaariyaan nasht ho jaati hai
 - Abhishek is obtained from cow's milk
 - shakkar mishrit jal se abhishek se santan prapti saral ho jaati hai
 - a person achieves salvation by the consecration of Bhasma
 - tel se bhi shiv ji kaa abhishek hota he
 But this is a usage of maran, should not be done normally
 kab rudrabhishek karnaa uttam or anukool hota he?-- rudrabhishek ke liye shiv ji kii upasthiti dekhnaa atyant aavashyak he- bina shiv ji kaa nivas dekhe kabhi bhi rudrabhishek na karen- anyathaa iske parinaam kaaphi kharaab ho sakate hai- shiv ji kaa nivas tabhi dekhnaa aavashyak he , jab manokamana kii purti ke liye abhishek kiya ja rahaa hokab shiv ji kaa nivas mangalakaari hota he?-- prayek maah ke shukla paksh kii dwitiya or navami , tathaa krishna paksh kii pratipada,ashtami tathaa amavasya ke din shiv ji maan gauri ke saath rahete hai
 - On the Chaturthi and Ekadashi of Krishna Paksha and on Panchami and Dwadashi of Shukla Paksha, Mahadev resides on Kailas
 - krishna paksh kii panchami or dwadashi ko tathaa shukla paksh kii shashthee or trayodashi tithi ko shiv ji nandi par savaar hokar sampoorn vishwa kaa bhraman karte hai 
 - In these dates, Mahadev's residence is Mangalakari, in which Rudrabhishek can be done when the residence of Shiva is evil
 
 - krishnapaksh kii dwitiya, navami tathaa shuklapaksh kii tritiya va dashami main mahadevaji devataaon kii sabha main unki samasyaayein sunate hai
 Nataraja Kridar falls on Tritiya of Krishna Paksh, Dashami and Shukla Paksha Chaturthi and Ekadashi
 - krishnapaksh kii shashthee, trayodashi tathaa shuklapaksh kii saptami va chaturdashi main rudradevabhojan karte hai
 - These dates cannot be consecrated when dates are not considered? - There is no need to consider Shiva's abode in the area of siddha Peetha or Jyotirlinga on Mondays of Shivaratri, Pradosh and Sawan
 - yah sthaan or samay sadaiv mangalakaari hota he
 UPA President Sonia Gandhi has demanded that the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha be from her party
 bataaya jaataa he ki unhone lok sabha adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ko ek patr likhakar yah baat kahi he
 However, it is unlikely that the BJP will give the post of Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha to the Congress
 niyamon ke mutabik lok sabha main vipaksh kaa netaa usee party ke sadsy ko banaaya jayega jiske paas kul sadasyon kii sankhya kaa das pratishat hoga
 That is, the MP of the same party will be made the leader of the opposition, which has 55 members
 congress ke paas is samay sirf 44 saansad hai or party is pad par adhikaar nahin jataa sakati
 It will depend on the will of the ruling party whether or not it gives this post to the Congress
 uske paas is samay 282 sadsy hai
 The total number of NDA members is 336
 loksabhaa main teen baar aise maukey aae hai jab vipaksh kaa koi netaa nahin banaaya gaya
 First of all, there was no leader of opposition during Jawaharlal Nehru's prime ministership
 uske baad 1984 main bhi lok sabha main vipaksh kaa koi netaa nahin tha
 Rajiv Gandhi had won 404 seats at that time and no party had got ten percent seats
 us samay sipiem ko adhiktam 22 siten mili thim
 The Congress may have the same satisfaction that on the basis of numbers it has got the right to be the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha
 purv swasthya mantri gulam nabi azaad vahaan party ke netaa banaae gaye hai
 The Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha gets the status of a cabinet minister and also gets a chamber in Parliament

 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that if Lalu Prasad Yadav is in danger of his life while in jail, he should be locked up in the Red Fort
 argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ke bete tathaa purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne haal hi main yah aarope lagaaya tha ki unke pita ko khatra he or bijepi kisi bhi had tak ja sakati he
 Shortly after the announcement of the sentence, Tejashwi made this sensational charge
 susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki jo aadmi jail main band he, jo police castady main he, agar uski jaan par khatra he tab to unako lalakile main band karvaa dena chahie
 He said that Lalu Yadav is a convict, he is currently in jail, under police protection for treatment for three-four days and people are not being allowed to meet
 roj purv se lekar shivanand tiwari kaa bayaan aa rahaa he ki milane nahin diya ja rahaa he, to kya kahana chaahate hai
 They should be locked in a cage, they have no answer
 unhone kaha ki inke paas to ek hi baat he, maar denge, hatya kar denge, yah BJP kaa shadyantr he, BJP kahaan he
 If Sushil Modi and Lallan Singh filed this petition, then there was Shivanand Tiwari who remains the right hand of Lalu ji
 ek maamle main nahin, yah chauthaa maamla tha jisamen sajaa hui he
 'bureaucrats and leaders should also take lessons', he said, on the other hand Rashtriya Janata Dal should take a lesson
 keval argedy ko hi nahin sabhi naukarshah or netaaon ko lalu yadav kii sajaa se sabak lenaa chahie ki bhrashtachar karoge to bachake nahin jaaoge
 The hands of the law are very long
 mauka mila he to seva karen, naa ki lalu yadav jaise logon ko mauka mila to khajaana lutwa die
 Tejashwi had said after the verdict that Lalu Prasad Yadav was in danger of life and had blamed the BJP
 argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ko chaara ghotaale ke chauthe maamle main 7-7 saal kii sajaa par pratikriya dete hue modi ne kaha ki dekhie nyaayik prakriya main koi ungali uthaanaa uchit nahin he
 But in the same case someone lives in a conspiracy, there are many different types of charges
 yah jaruri nahin ki hatya ke maamle main, chori ke maamle main, bhrashtachar ke maamle main ek hi prakaar kii sajaa mili
 If hundreds of people were involved in the fodder scam, then there might be some kind of punishment for all
 lalu yadav mukhyamantri the unhone shyaam bihari sinha ko sangrakshan dene kaa kaam kiya or jitne ghotalebaj the unki seva avadhi ko vistaar diya
 His children were guardians in school, there were many allegations of this type, so it is very natural to have different punishment
 'kya hamane sajaa diya he lalu ko jo ham par aarope lagaae ja rahe hai'tejasvi ke lalu yadav ko 2019 ke chunaav tak jail se baahar nahin aane dene ke shadyantra ke aarope par susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki kya hamane sajaa diya he, kya ham logon ne unako jail main rakhaa yaa court ne rakhaa
 Whatever i want to say, what should i answer? agar bihar police ne kisi apradhi ko pakad kar thane main band kiya hota tab to ek baat thi wo to nyaayik hiraasat main hai
 Where does BJP come from, where does Nitish Kumar come from, but to make his workers happy, he has to give a statement, say anything
 'lalu kaa 13 karod kaa ghotaalaa 300 karod ke baraabar'unhone kaha ki bayaan dene se naa sajaa kam hogi or naa badhegi, vahaan to merit par kaam hoga
 Second, i would also ask Lalu's son to learn a lesson
 28 saal kii umr main 1000 karod kii sampatti ke maalik ban gaye or seenaa taan kar gum rahe hai jaise lagata he ki mehnat se inhone apni sampatti jamaa kar rakhi he
 Speaking on the charge of implicating Lalu, Modi said that the 13 crores of that time is equal to 300 crores today
 ab lalu yadav ke log yah prachaar karen ki bijepi ne fansaa diya to yah faisla kya bijepi ne diya he, kya BJP ke kisi kaaryakarta kaa faisla he
 'lalu does not have the answer, so did not get acquitted' Modi said that it is the decision of the judiciary, the people of RJD are doing such propaganda, as if the judge of CBI Special Court is the man of CBI
 aapane hindustan ke behtareen vakeelon ko bulaakar bahes karavaaya, sibiai ne bahes kiya, gavaah gujarey, uske baad court ne faisla kiya or ek maamle main nahin 4 maamalon main faisla hua he
 What they want to promote, sometimes they say Lalu to jail and Jagannath Mishra to bail, sometimes some, sometimes some
 sawaal to yah he ki jin par aarope lage us par kya jawaab he inke paas or jawaab hota to 4 main se kisi naa kisi maamle main to yah bari ho jate
 But in a single case it has not been acquitted till date
 bijepi saansdaur bihari babu shatrughna sinha sajaa ke faisle ke baad lalu prasad yadav se milane ranchi ke aspataal pahunche
 He said that Lalu Yadav will come out immediately, Modi reacted to this saying that there are mps, artists are men, artist men continue to meet everyone, then what is a big surprise if we meet

 In this painful accident, 6 people, including 3 women, lost their lives, while 33 people are said to be injured
 ye brij aaazaad maidan ko siesaimati railway stesan se jodta he
 When this incident happened, many people were present at that time
 iske alaava kai gaadiyaan bhi is brij kii chapet main aa gayi
 Many facts related to the Indus Valley Civilization are still coming to the fore
 isi kram main iaiti khadgpur ne bhi is sabhyataa ke khatm hone ko lekar kai tathy jari kiye hai
 According to these facts, the 4350 years old Indus Valley came to an end due to a drought
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yah sookhaa 10-20 saal nahin balki 900 saal tak padaa tha, jisaki vajah se is sabhyataa kaa ant hua
 Earlier, the theory came out that this drought had lasted for 200 years, but this study has denied it
 times of india kii khabar ke anusaar yah adhyayan isi maheene ek antarrashtriya patrika main bhi prakashit hoga
 It has been found in the study that due to this 900 years of drought, the people there were forced to flee
 165 saal pehle aaj hi ke din bharat main chali thi pehali trainiaiti khadgpur ke bhuvigyaan or bhubhautikee vibhaag ke shodhakarta 5,000 saalon ke dauraan monsoon kii asthirataa par shodh kar rahe hai
 At the same time, he came to know that centuries ago, the north-west part of the Himalayas had not received rain for 900 years, due to which there was a shortage of water and dried up all the rivers, due to which they existed
 vahiin, purv or dakshin main barish hone kii sthitiyaan behatar thim isliye vahaan rahane waalon ko is tarah ke sookhe kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 Apart from the army, they are also in India's Top 10 Force! Study has also revealed that from 2,350 B
C
 (4,350 years ago) to 1,450 B
C
, the monsoon was becoming very weak in the civilized area
 dhire-dhire sookhaa padane laga
 In such a situation, people started migrating towards green areas
 ye log ganga-yamuna ghati kii ore jane lag gaye the
 what! Rahul Gandhi being made Congress President in April? 
 
 
 pakkaa? bataaie banenge yaa nahin? ab rahul ji kii tarah asamanjas main mat rakhie
 Well, let's assume that he is going to be president
 to ve karenge kya? jis party ke ve adhyaksh banane ja rahe hai, usamen ab kuch 'varisht' netaa hi bache hai
 The workers left at some time
 to rahul gandhi ko milane vaali is nai jimmedaari ke myne kya hai-1
 The party has to conduct elections, will it be able to become a strict election commissioner? Rahul, who joined politics in 2004, wants to conduct elections at every level in the party
 taaki nai leadership aage aae
 He was able to do this in the Youth Congress, but its effect was not seen because the leadership of the Congress Party continued to work on the old structure
 rahul congress adhyaksh banate hai to pehla kaam yahi hoga ki ve puure desh main congress ke chunaav karaaen
 Absolutely fair haalanki, ye bhi aam chunaav kii tarah hi honge
 Hoping to revive the oldest party
 2
 Will we be able to stop tourism? There seems to be a lack of seriousness in Rahul Gandhi's political career so far, as if he had come here for part time politics
 jaise ki bollywood sitare, khiladiyon ko sansad main aate or usee shaam ek tivi sho host karte ham dekhte hai
 Rahul does not even know when he comes to Parliament and when he goes out for a walk
 ab unhen paryaton band karke phulatimer bananaa hi nahin, dikhnaa bhi hoga
 3
 senapati kii tarah aage aa paaenge?ab tak digvijay singh, kapil sibbal, manishankar ayyar or manish tiwari jaise netaa hi party kaa cheharaa bane hue the
 The news of Congress began to be built around them
 tab ye samajha ja saktaa tha ki sonia gandhi media se baatcheet main utani sahaj nahin hai
 But this is not the case with Rahul
 ve har mudde par apni baat rakh sakate hai
 If they do not do so, the party will become like CPI (marxist)
 vahaan bhi pichley das saal se prakaash karaat parde ke peeche se hi party chalaa rahe hai
 Forts like Bengal and Kerala have been lost
 4
 Will it break the aura of 'senior' leaders? One reason for Rahul Gandhi's apathy is the party's traditional structure and its similar working style
 ve usamen amul-chul badlaav chaahate hai
 He has drafted several times for these changes
 lekin lagu nahin kar paae, kyonki party kii sarvocch satta bhale unki maa ke haath ho
 The influence of senior leaders remained on him
 har faisle, har ranneeti par iskaa asar dikhaa
 This family is so powerful that every strategy and ticket decision related to the election has been done on their own free will
 rahul chahenge ki yah sab ab band ho
 5
 apane netaaon se parformens par sawaal kar paaenge?congress kii ek ajeeb sthiti he
 There are some leaders in every state that the Congress runs from them
 ve hi netaa banaate hai, hataate hai
 They only give tickets
 jab party harati he to ve hi jaanch karte hai or haikaman ko report bhejte hai
 Then he is commanded in the next election
 ab dam rahul gandhi ko dikhaanaa hoga
 Will they be able to question the neighboring leaders what they have done
 kya ve tatasth rup se faisla de paaenge ki netaaon ko agali jimmedaari unke report card ke aadhaar par hi di jaaegi
 Not by name and stature
 congress party abhi shunya par khadi he
 This is not Delhi's election results, but its political status in the country
 satta ke kisi bhi taane-bane main uskaa zikr nahin ho rahaa he
 His position in the opposition is like a back-bencher
 to rahul kaa kaam is rup main aasaan he ki unhen party ke alaava kahin or dhyaan nahin lagaana he
 And the difficulty is that when the party is in such abyss, why would anyone take interest in its organization
 puraane mathadhish to prachaar karenge ki rahul ji achche netaa hai, lekin unki yojana vyaavhaarik nahin he
 Congress chief Rahul Gandhi will have a chance to hide them only during the party elections

 The result was that even when he stood on the wicket, just understand that he is now buried

 maharaj sagar chakravarti samraat the
 She had two queens named Keshini and Sumati
 keshini ke putr kaa naam asamanjas tha or sumati ke saath hajaar putr the
 Asmanjus' son's name was Anshuman
 raja sagar ke asamanjas sahit sabhi putr atyant uddand or dusht prakruti ke the, parantu anshuman dharmik or dev gurupujak tha
 Unhappy with the sons, Maharaja removed Asmanjas from the country and made Anshuman his successor
 sagar ke saath hajaar putron se devtaa bhi dukhi rahete the
 Once Maharaja Sagara performed the Ashwamedha Yagna and left the horse for him
 indra ne ashwamedh yajna ke ghode ko churaakar pataal main le jaakar kapilmuni ke ashram main baandh diya, parantu dhyanavastha kapil muni is baat ko jaan na sake
 Sagar's sixty thousand arrogant sons searched the corner of the earth
 kintu ve log ghode ko na paa sake
 In the end, they dug the path from Earth to Hades and went to Kapil Muni's ashram
 vahaan ghoda dekhakar krodhit ho shastr uthaa kar kapil muni ko maarane daude 
 When the austerity was interrupted, the sage opened his eyes and sixty thousand defiant sons of Sagar were immediately consumed
 garud ke dwaara is ghatana kii jaankaree milane par anshuman kapilmuni ke ashram main aae tathaa unki stuti kii
 Kapilmuni was pleased with his plea and said, take the horse Anshuman and complete the yagya of your grandfather
 sagar putr uddand, ahamkaari or adharmee the 
 Their liberation can only happen when they have a touch of ashes from the Ganges water
 anshuman ne ghoda le jaakar apane pita pitamah raja sagar kaa yajna puraa karaayaa
 After Maharaja Sagar, Anshuman became king, but he remained concerned about the emancipation of his uncles
 kuch samay baad apane putr dilip ko rajya kaa kaarybhaar saunp kar van main chale gaye tathaa ganga ji ko swarg se prithvi par laane ke liye tapasya karne lage or tapasya main hi unka ant bhi ho gaya
 Maharaj Dilip also handed over the kingdom to his son Bhagiratha and followed the father's path
 unka bhi tapasya main hi sharir kaa ant hua parantu vah ganga ji ko prithvi par naa laa sake
 After Maharaja Dilip, Bhagirath did severe penance of Bramhaji and Devadhidev Mahadev Shankar
 jiske parinaam swarup bhageerath ganga ko prithvi par laane main safal hue 
 Ganga is also known as 'bhagirathi' due to his incarnation from Bhagiratha's penance
 ganga ji iske baad prithvi ko haraa-bharaa karte hue kapil muni ke ashram main pahunchi jahaan maharaj bhageerath ke saath hajaar purvaj bhasma kii dheri bane hue pade the 
 With the touch of Ganga water, all the celestial beings have gone to the divine world

 in sanghathanon kaa daawa he ki wo peedit adivaasiyon ko naa keval kanoonee sahaayta de rahe hai balki police or kendriya suraksha balon kii jyadatiyon ko lekar peediton kaa saath de rahe hai
 Human rights activists Shalini Gera and Bella Bhatiyane have alleged that all-round pressure is being made to get them out of Bastar
 police ne aaropon ko kiya khaarijudhar bastar police ne maanav adhikaaravaadi sanghathanon ke aaropon ko sire se kaarij kar diya he
 According to Bastar Range IG SRP Kalluri, some activists had sent a complaint in this regard to the Superintendent of Police, which is under investigation

 They say that they are providing legal help to the victims, hence the police wants to drive them out of the area
 rajya ke mukhyamantri raman singh ne police ko peedit kaaryakartaaon ko paryaapt suraksha dene ke nirdesh die hai
 Most human rights organizations working in Bastar take the cases of excesses of police and central security forces from the streets to the courts
 lekin naksalion ke dwaara anjaam di gai ghatnaon kii ninda tak nahin karte
 Not only this, these human rights organizations neither raised the cases of common villagers, police and central security forces personnel killed at the hands of Naxalites, nor took the matter to court to punish the Naxalites
 yahi kaaran he ki bastar main maanavadhikaaravaadi sanghathanon or police ke bich khai khinchati chali ja rahi he

 Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has received a major relief from the Supreme Court in Ayodhya in 1990 for firing on car servants
 supreme court ne mulaayam singh ke khilaaf FIR darj karne kii yachika khaarij kar di he
 The Supreme Court said that there was a delay in filing an appeal in the Supreme Court against the decision of the High Court, hence the petition is dismissed on this basis
 darasal 277 dinon kii deree ke baad ye yachika daakhil kii gai thi
 Earlier, in 1990, the case of firing on car servants reached the Supreme Court
 rana sangram singh ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kar 1990 main car sevakon par goli chalaane kaa aadesh dene ko lekar uttar pradesh ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri mulaayam singh yadav ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj karne kii maang kii thi
 Rana Sangram Singh said in his petition that in a public meeting held in Mainpuri district on 6 February 2014, Mulayam Singh Yadav said that on his orders, in 1990, the police opened fire on car workers in Ayodhya
 rana sangram singh ke vaqeel vishnu jain ke mutabik is bayaan ke baad rana sangram singh ne lakhanu police main mulaayam singh ke khilaaf hatya or aapraadhik sajeesh kaa mukadmaa darj karne kii guhaar lagaai thi

 Against which he filed a petition in the Allahabad High Court
 hai court ne bhi 3 may 2016 ko yachika kaarij kar di

 is vidheyak ko paarit karana sarkaar ke liye kathin pariksha sabit ho sakati he kyonki sapa iskaa virodh kar rahi he, jabaki bahujan samaaj party (basapa) samarthan kar rahi he
 Kamal Nath told the media, 'the reservation bill is in the first list of Rajya Sabha
 ham sapa ko manaane kaa prayaas karenge
 He said that it is extremely important to get this bill passed because it was brought in the upper house in the last session itself
 mantri ne kaha, 'is vidheyak ko pichley satr main rajyasabha main laayaa gaya tha
 The debate had already started, so it is a burning act
 isamen kuch bhi nayaa nahin he
 The SP has, however, decided to continue opposing the bill and not to pass it
 sapa netaa naresh agarwal ne kaha, 'ham iskaa virodh karenge or sarkaar se kahenge ki vah kaarysoochee se is vivaadaaspad mudde ko hataae taaki sadan kii kaarywahi chal sake
 'he said,' This is a bill to divide society

 'bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne kaha he ki vah aam taur par aarakshan ke paksh main he lekin vaastavik rup se usne apana rukh spasht nahin kiya
 BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, 'all sections of society, be it Scheduled Castes, Backward Classes or Minorities, should come into the mainstream
 'unhone kaha, 'hamen dekhnaa he ki sarkaar is vidheyak ko kya rup detii he, uske baad ham apana rukh tay karenge
 'it is noteworthy that due to differences in the Bill in the current session, the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha have to be postponed several times

 Seeing this incident, the people passing through the toll informed the police, after which the police reached the spot at around 12 pm and rescued both the victims from the clutches of the guards

 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has claimed to bring all political parties together, but this fight to deal with dengue and chikungunya seems to be limited to mere rhetoric
 video sandesh jari karne ke baad se hi aam aadmi party sarkaar ke netaa beemaari ko jad se khatm karne kii bajaay puure maamle main jamkar raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 Neither mosquito repellent was sprayed in every locality and every street of Delhi, nor was there any announcement to buy a new fogging machine
 swasthya mantri se jab sawaal poocha gaya ki virdohi partiyon ko ab tak dengue or chikangunia free banane kii muhim se kyon nahin jod paae to unhone kaha ki mukhyamantri sabhi se baat karenge
 Further, Satyendra Jain said that 'the Chief Minister has ordered that if the MCD has not done fogging, then i have to get fogging
 baaki netaaon se baatcheet khud aravind kejariwal karenge
 On the question of not bringing the opposing parties together, Kapil Mishra said that "the mosquito does not see caste or religion
" sabhi se baat kar rahe hai
 Manoj Tiwari and i did fogging together
 sabhi saath aana chaahate he
 "meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party government, which is advised to work in harmony, has been accused by their own legislators that they are not called on behalf of the government in the meeting of dengue and chikungunya or other development works
 ye sawaal jab kapil mishra se poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki "mujhe nahin lagata aisa kuch he ham sabhi vidhayakon ke sampark main hai
 "surprisingly, so far the government report does not mention many deaths from chikungunya
 jabaki din ba din dengue or chikangunia ke maamalon main ijapha ho rahaa he
 Earlier, Health Minister Satyendra Jain had also been in a lot of controversies with the statement that he did not die of chikungunya
 isliye sawaal ye bhi khadaa ho rahaa he ki kuch sarkaar or agenciyaan kya maut ke aankade chupa rahi he? These days BJP President Amit Shah is constantly meeting with the leaders of his allies and taking over the NDA clan

 koun he manoj jaiswal
 Nowadays this name is in the headlines in coal block allocation, because out of 57, 8 coal blocks have been allocated to 5 different companies of Manoj Jaiswal itself
 ajtak ke haath isse jude kagajaat lage he jisase is ghotaale ko lekar or bhi khulaase hote hai
 There has been such a ruckus on coal that Parliament has come to a standstill
 rose nae-nae sawaal uth rahe he
 The CBI has also been thrown into the investigation
 lekin is tamaam gahamagahami ke bich ajtak ke haath kuch aise dastauez lage hai jo sarkaar ke liye mushkilen khadi kar sakate hai
 The papers state that out of the 57 coal blocks allocated, eight blocks were given to the same family in Nagpur
 ye parivaar he manoj jaisawal kaa
 The government allotted eight coal blocks in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh to their five companies, Abhijeet Infrastructure, JAS Infrastructure, Jaiswal Neco, Corporate Ispat and JLD Yamatwal
 in companiyon ko kol blaks 2005 se 2009 ke bich aavantit kiye gaye
 But experts say that allotting 8 out of 57 coal blocks to a single family raises questions about the entire process
 is mudde par ajtak ne manoj jaisawal se baat karne kii koshish kii lekin unhone camere par aane se manaa kar diya
 It is said that Manoj Jaiswal is a distant relative of current coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal
 sutara bataate hai ki manoj shriprakash jaisawal ke samadhi ke bhai ke damaad hai
 However, the coal minister is denying this relationship
 sach ye bhi he ki jin dinon ye aavanton hua tha tab shriprakash jaisawal koyala mantri nahin the
 By the way, there is another Congress leader in the circle of questions - Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Darda
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki manoj jaisawal kii jin companiyon ko aath kol blox aavantit kiye gaye unamem darada parivaar kii bhi hissedari he
 Government papers state that the Darda family has a 50% stake in a company named JLD Yavatmal Energy, one of the five companies owned by Manoj Jaiswal
 isi company ko chhattisgarh main fatehpur east naam kaa koyala block aavantit kiya gaya tha
 Surprisingly, the company named JLD Yavatmal Energy, which got the coal block in 2008, was registered in December 2006
 yani mahaj do saal puraani company ko kol block kaa aavanton kiya gaya
 Another important thing at that time, the entire Darda family had neither the experience of mining nor the energy sector
 jaahir he aise main kol aavanton kii screening kamity par bhi sawaal jarur uthenge hi
 Manoj Jaiswal and many of his family members hold stakes in these companies
 puraa parivaar nagpur ke usha sadan main rahata he
 Certainly this will prove to be a major headache for the Congress because now the layers have started to open, in which it is clear that the people associated with the Congress have been benefited in the coal block allocation

 12:05 AM aaj se shuru hoga sansad kaa monsoon satr, hangaame ke asaar12:02 AM raashtrapati chunaav ke liye voting aaj Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi while expressing his procedure on the declaration of punishment in the fodder scam of RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav on Wednesday said that i would not like to comment
 court kya faisla karata he, koi nahin jaanata he lekin vah adatan bhrashtachar ke maamle main aaropee hai, isliye unako kathor sajaa milani chahie
 Sushil Modi said, 'they have been punished in one case and this is the second case and till now the practice of the court has been that those who are habitual criminals, the court punishes them more severely and the other thing is that till now this second There is a case in which punishment is going to be done now, that is why we should wait, we will wait for the decision of the court, but i personally feel more harsh punishment should be given because a mother He has been convicted in Male and this is the second case
 modi ne usee cese main purv mukhyamantri jagannatha mishra ko bari kiye jane vaale maamle par kaha ki kya court karegaa yah alag baat he
 He said, 'see if all the cases are different, if there is a murder, then 10 people are involved in it, one who kills, is involved in the conspiracy, who cooperated
 to sawaal he ki is puure maamle main doctor jagannatha mishra kii kya bhoomika thi? vah to koi mukhyamantri the nahin, sarkaar main the nahin, vot koi tregeri officer nahin the, vah vipaksh ke netaa the
 i have not seen the entire order of the court, but different people live in the same case, in which the court acquits someone and punishes someone, it does not mean that if acquitted Jagannath Mishra is acquitted
 Will give sawaal yah he ki lalu yadav netaa vipaksh the, mukhyamantri the, vitt mantri the
 He was among those who extended the extension to Shyambihari Sinha
 anya logon kii seva avadhi kaa vistaar kiya
 Therefore, one cannot compare what is the case of Doctor Jagannath Mishra, what is the case of RK Rana or the case of Jagdish Sharma
 sabhi abhiyukton ko ek samaan taraazoo par taala nahin ja saktaa
 Caste cardi will no longer work on the caste order giving a racist color to the court, saying that Lalu ji feels that he will win the election by playing Mishra, Yadav's card, then he has played this card many times and despite playing that card The situation was such that the Rashtriya Janata Dal which won 170 seats reached 25 seats in 2010 and reached 80 on the shoulder of Nitish ji
 vah agar apane balboote agar chunaav lard len to pataa nahin kahaan hawa ho jaaenge
 The time is gone when they played Brahmin cards, Dalit cards, backward cards and those whom they looted were Dalit and backward and among those whom the court has punished, 50% are Dalits and backward and those who are acquitted also have a large number of high There are people of caste and the court does not decide on the basis of who belongs to which caste
 bijepi kii krupa se lalu bane the bihar ke siemunhone kaha ki court kabhi bijepi, argedicongress keadhar par nirnay nahin karata he
 Lalu Yadav had come to the bjp's doorstep for the first time, who would have been the Chief Minister of Bihar and if the BJP had not supported him that day
 to bijepi kii krupa se vah bihar ke mukhyamantri bane
 Lalu has a habit of going to jail! Sushil Modi said, "adan is a prison traveler
 vah pehali baar koi jail yatra par nahin ja rahe hai
 Sometimes he has come out on an elephant, sometimes has gone on a rickshaw, sometimes he is going on a horse
 ye to adatan jail jane ke aadi he
 So they have become habitual

 argedy ko apana chunaav chihn badal kar LED balb kar lenaa chahiesushil kumaar modi ne argedy ko apana chunaav chinh badalane kaa suzav diya he
 Calling for making 2018 a lantern-free Bihar, Modi said that now electricity will reach Bihar's house by the end of the year
 aise main argedy ke chunaav chinh laalaten kaa ab koi astitv nahin rah jayega
 Modi said that RJD should change its election symbol from lantern to LED bulb
 unhone kaha ki laalaten mukt to ho hi gaya, gaanv to mukt honge
 By the end of the year 2018, there will not be a single house, where there will be no electricity bulb in the village
 isiilie rajd ko main ek hi suzav duungaa ki vah apana chunaav chinh LED balb kar le
 The era is not of a bullock cart but of a bullet train
 LED lite kaa jamaana he
 He felt that the people of Bihar would keep carrying lanterns, that's why he kept the election symbol lantern, Lantern-free Bihar is going to be and by the end of the year, there will be lantern-free Bihar
 haalanki susheel modi ke is bayaan par pratikriya dete hue RJD ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari ne kaha ki laalaten basic cheez he or isko hataaya nahi ja saktaa he
 He said that the way development is being done by damaging the environment, we will have to return to the lantern and bullock cart era again

 gil ne kaha he ki yahbharatake liye bada sanket he or is prastaav kaa swaagat kiya janaa chahie
 He wondered why India had not responded positively to General Bajwa's proposal so far
 shanivaar ko pakistan ke piem imran khan ke shapath grahan samaaroh main gaye navjot singhsiddhune kaha tha ki unhen general bajva kii ore se yah prastaav diya gaya tha
 He said that he had expressed the desire to open the route for Najankana Sahib
 pakistan kii kai jagahon main se ye donon jagahen sikhon kii aasthaa kaa centre rahi hai
 Gill, who has visited Pakistan many times, said that the Indian government has never taken any such initiative for Sikhs
 unhone kaha, 'muslimon ke paas makka he, hinduon ke paas tirupati he, lekin chota sasikhasmudaay pakistan main kartarpur sahib jane se vanchit kyon he?'pakistan main jane par sikh yatri guru nanak ke janmasthan nankana sahib to chale jate hai lekin unhen kartarpur sahib jane kii ijaajat nahin hoti he

 Ramkripal Yadav defeated Lalu's daughter Misa Bharti from Pataliputra seat in Bihar
 isse purv centre kii to baat hi chhod dijie, vah kabhi rajya main bhi mantri nahin bane the, lekin aaj unhen modi mantriparishad main shaamil kar liya gaya
 The inclusion of Ramkripal in the Union Council of Ministers is being seen as a strategy by the BJP to dent Lalu Prasad Yadav's Yadav vote bank ahead of next year's assembly elections in Bihar
 bihar main yadav samudaay voton main 12 fisadi se adhik kii bhagidaari rakhata he or yah ab tak khud ko lalu prasad ke saath chinhit karata aayaa he, lekin bijepi ne haalia loksabhaa chunaav main lalu ke is majboot vot bank main send laga di he, jahaan usne pradhanmantri kii chaay bechney vaale or pichhadaa varg se hone kii chhavi ko behad safal tareeke se pesh kiya
 Ramkripal split from his 'guru' after the RJD was denied a ticket from Pataliputra
 vah bhale hi bijepi se pehali baar saansad bane hon, lekin chunavi raajnneeti main vah nausikhie nahin hai
 He entered the Lok Sabha for the fourth time through the May 2014 general election
 pichley teen chunaav unhone argedy ke tikat par jite the
 Ramkripal Yadav has had a long political career but was never made a minister
 na to bihar main or na hi centre main
 However the RJD was part of the UPA and had half a dozen ministers from its party
 jamini str se uthe ramkripal yadav 1992 se 93 ke bich patna nagar nigam main up meyar rahe or 1993 se 1996 ke bich vidhaan parishad ke sadsy bhi rahe
 Ramkripal Yadav, born on 12 October 1957 in Patna, Bihar's capital, had a difficult childhood
 unke pita ke nidhan ke kaaran unhen kaaphi dushwariyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He is a LLB degree holder with a graduate from Magadh University
 1983 main unka vivaah kiran devi se hua tha
 They have two sons and a daughter

 They were extinct 6 million years ago due to the impact of meteor bodies on Earth

 20 million years ago, when large-scale organisms started disappearing from Earth, then dinosaurs started expanding
 ‘nechar communications’ main prakashit ek adhyayan main italy ke museum of science, uniwarsitis of ferera and padova or britain kii uniwarsity of bristol ke vaigyanikon ne bataaya he ki dianasor kaa vistaar bhi ek sankat se hi hua tha
 This crisis is called mass destruction
 is sankat ke dauraan prithvi se badi sankhya main jeev or paudhe vilupt ho gaye the
 The havoc of the cold, snowfall in the world's hottest desert, the remains of dinosaurs found in the Dolomites of northern Italy, say that the first dinosaur traces are not found, but later many dinosaur traces are found
 bristol main research associest evam museum of science ke nireekshak ne bataaya- ham yah dekhakar utsahit hai ki dianasor ke pairon ke nishaan or asthipanjar isi kahani kii ore ishaara karte hai
 We studied dinosaur footprints in the Dolomites for some time
 isse prithvi par dianasor ke naamo nishaan nahin hone se lekar inaki sankhya main badhotaree hone kaa pataa chalata he

 The report said that Satish was also informed in writing about the matter, but he interrupted the supply of oxygen cylinders
 haalanki vah oxigen silendar kii supplai ke liye jimmedaar hai
 So he is guilty of this

 The South MCD has once again collected more property tax than its target amid the weak financial condition of the North and East mcds
 bataa den, pehali baar nahin he jab aisa hua ho
 South MCD has made this record by presenting its strong image by collecting house tax more than the target for the third consecutive year
 kamishnar punit kumaar goyal ne iske liye assesament and collection vibhaag kii prashansa kii he
 According to the corporation, this was done due to the continuous efforts of the Assessment and Collection Department
 karadaataaon ko bhugtan kii antim tithi se pehle tex bhugtan ke liye jaagruk karne kaa hi parinaam he ki lagaataar tisare saal lakshya se adhik tex collection ho paaya he
 According to South MCDK, the Assessment and Collection Department collected property tax of Rs 691 crore as on 31 March 2018 this year, against the target of Rs 650 crore
 aapako bataa den ki property tex dene ke liye is baar south emsidi ne march ke aakhri dinon main aane vaale do rajpatrit avkaash or shanivaar ko bhi assesament and collection vibhaag ke sabhi daftar khule rakhe
 Apart from this, taxpayers were also given a discount of 2 percent on online payment

 During this period, property tax of Rs 12 crore was received from Delhi Police, Rs 20 crore from Delhi Zoo and Rs 30 crore from Air Force
 kamishnar punit kumaar goyal ne bataaya ki beete saalon main bhi property tex ke zyada collection ke kaaran hi kai vikaas kaary kiye gaye or is saal bhi vikaas kii kai yojanaon ko puraa kiya ja sakegaa
 Apart from this, South MCD will try to increase the scope of tax payers this year
 karnataka main kumaraswami sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko vidhansabha main vishwaas mat kho diya, jiske chalate congress-jedies gathbandhan sarkaar gir gai
 The rebellion of 3 JDS and 13 Congress mlas led to political crisis and ultimately Kumaraswamy has lost power
 yah sach he ki vidhayakon ke istife ke chalate gathbandhan sarkaar chali gai
 However, there are many other reasons why Kumaraswamy had to see this day
 trishanku vidhansabhakarnataka ke 2018 vidhansabha chunaav main kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin mila tha
 Out of total 224 assembly seats in the state, BJP emerged as the largest party with 104 seats, which was 9 seats short of majority
 congress ko 78 siten (do siten upachunaav main jeetne ke baad) or jedies ko 37 siten mili thim
 After this, the Congress decided to form the Kumaraswamy government by supporting the JDS to keep the BJP out of power
 congress ne yah daanv ek saal ke baad hone vaale loksabhaa ke liye khelaa tha
 At the same time, JDS, who had been out of power for 12 years, took advantage of the opportunity
 yahi vajah rahi kii 2018 main sarkaar banane ke baad se lagaataar kumaraswami sarkaar dagamagaati rahi or 15 maheene ke baad use satta gavanni padi
 The congress-jds mismatch coalition has the political base of the Congress all over Karnataka, while the JDS has a hold in the districts of Old Mysore
 congress rajya ke sabhi jati or dharmon ke vot par pakad rakhti he
 At the same time, the JDS represents the Vokkaliga community, which is the dominant zamindar caste in Karnataka
 karnataka main vidhansabha chunaav main congress or jedies ek duusare ke khilaaf chunavi maidan main utre the
 Both political parties have been opposed to each other, but after securing secularism, a coalition was formed in the government after the election
 dashakon se ek-duusare ke khilaaf ladane vaale donon partiyon ke netaaon ko achaanak samjhauta karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 As a result, in the Lok Sabha elections, the leaders and workers of both parties could not remain united on the ground
 yahi vajah he ki congress-jedies kaa bemail gathbandhan apana lanbaa safar tay nahin kar sakaa
 KC Venugopal, the Congress in-charge and general secretary of the internal opposition, announced his support to the JDS with the consent of the party high command
 congress ke sthaneey netaaon ko vishwaas main nahin liya gaya
 Especially former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who came to the Congress after breaking ties with the Deve Gowda family
 congress alaakaman ne jedies ke saath jane kaa man bana liya tha, jiske chalate us samay siddharmaiya ke paas samarthan karne ke sivaa koi or vikalp nahin bachaa tha
 This is the reason that out of the 13 Congress mlas who have revolted and resigned, most of them are close to Siddaramaiah
 itnaa hi nahin kumaraswami ne bhi kai baar siddharmaiya par sarkaar ko asthir karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 At the same time, 3 JDS mlas who resigned had blamed all the allegations on Siddaramaiah
 iske antaravirodh ko samajha ja saktaa he
 The result of the rebellion in 2019 was because of the good performance of BJP and JDS in the Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka from the 90s
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main rajya kii satta par congress-jedies ke virajman hone ke baad bhi donon partiyaan jeet nahin saki
 While out of the total 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state, the alliance had hoped to win 22 seats
 lekin 23 may ko jab nattejey aayaa to saare armaan chur ho gaye
 BJP 25, Congress 2, JDS and Independents managed to win one seat each
 karnataka main bijepi se ladane ke bajaay congress or jedies ek duusare ko haraane par lage rahe
 The defeat of the Lok Sabha elections sowed a doubt on the stability of the alliance and the congress-jds mlas finally revolted
 bengalooru kii upekshakarnataka kaa kareeb aadha rajasav rajdhani bengalooru se aata he
 This belt has 28 assembly seats (more than 10 per cent of the total strength of the assembly)
 bengaluru main praudyogiki companiyon ke vikaas ke kaaran rajya main kaaphi ahmiyat he
 Due to JDS having a rural base, Kumaraswamy had focused on her, which led to accusations of neglecting Bengaluru
 bengalooru ke sthaneey vidhayak or bengalooru deveopment athurity ke chairman asti somshekhar, purv grih mantri ramalinga reddy or bairathi basavaraja ne bagawati rukh akhriyaar kar liya
 The report of Justice SN Dhingra Commission in the Robert Vadra Land Deal case has reached the Haryana Government
 sarkaar ne report kii takneekee or kanoonee jaanch shuru kar di he
 Cabinet minister in Haryana government Anil Vij told 'aaj Tak' that now the government will call a cabinet meeting on the report, which will decide how and when further action will be taken on the report
 duusari ore, dhingra kamishan kii jaanch ke daayre main rahe wo dastavej 'aaj tak' ke haath lage hai, jinase pataa chalata he ki kis tareeke se robert wadra kii jameen ko change of land yuj kaa letters jari kiya gaya
 It has the signatures of 2008 Chief Town Planner Dhare Singh, DTCP Director Country Town Planning SS Dhillon, DS Dhesi then Chief Town Country Planning and currently Chief Secretary of Haryana to Additional Chief Secretary to former Chief Minister
 17 march 2008 se 25 march 2008 tak is file par likh diya gaya ki letters of intent tatkaal diya jaae
 It is being said that the real game started on this land only after CLU and this land reached 7 million to 50 lakhs on its own
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke samarthak or virdohi donon us vakt hairaan rah gaye jab unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ke oficial fasebuk pej se kuch ajeebogareeb caments dekhe
 For example, he was sarcastic about Modi's page and satirical articles like 'abki Baar Hahakaar' were written
 sugabugahat uthi ki unka fasebuk pej hack kar liya gaya he
 But this was not a hacking, but a trick
 ye coment kisi or pej se likhe gaye, lekin trick ke jariye aisa laga ki modi ke oficial fasebuk pej se yah kaam kiya gaya he
 Actually, a Facebook page named 'supermaniac Swami' posted an indolent cartoon of Modi and Obama
 is par ek special kairactor naam vaale fasebuk pej se narendra modi ko tag karte hue chaar coment kiye gaye
 There was a satire for Modi in all these comments
 pehla coment tha, 'mujhe yah (cartoon) aapattijanak laga
 My devotees should immediately hawk with the support of Charlie Abdo
 ' iske baad likhaa gaya, 'mek in india
 But don't make Charlie Abdo in India
 ' teesraa coment tha, 'mere paas in sab chizon ke liye samay nahin he
 i am busy with elections and foreign tours
 abaki baar haahaakaar
 After this, a user named Saud Khan tagged Modi and asked, 'mr
 PM, are you really that?' The answer was, 'no, this is my lookalike
 ' ek or shaks ne coment karke poocha ki kya modi kaa acount hack ho gaya he
 It seemed that these comments were made from Modi's page, but the special character before Modi's name revealed all the secrets
 darasal us chote se special kairactor naam se ek fasebuk pej banaaya gaya tha
 When we clicked on his thumb profile image, we reached the page from which these comments were actually made
 aap bhi agar is tarah ke coment se do-chaar hon to us par yakeen karne se pehle acchhee tarah dekh lijiega
 She can also be a trick

 As the parties continue to have intense churn over the candidates for the presidential election
 to aise yah jaananaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki hamaare desh memrashtrapati chunaavaki prakriya saral nahin he
 Election is done by indirect voting
 janata kii jagah janata ke chune hue pratinidhi raashtrapati ko chunate hai
 Why the public could not choose directly President
 In 1848, Louis Napoleon was elected as the head of state by the direct vote of the people, Louis Napoleon overthrew the French Republic and claimed that he was elected directly by the people, Is the king of France
 is ghatana ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, bharat ke raashtrapati apratyaksh rup se chune jate hai
 The Presidential Election is held from the Electoral College, the President of India is elected by the Electoral College
 samvidhan ke artical 54 main iskaa ullekh he
 It consists of elected members of both the Houses of Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies of the States
 do centreshasit pradeshon, dilli or pudducheri, ke vidhayak bhi chunaav main hissaa lete hai jinaki apni vidhansabhaayen hai
 The method by which the election is held is by a single transferable vote based on the system of proportional representation
 sabhi saansadon or vidhayakon ke paas nishchit sankhya main mat hai, haalanki, har nirvaachit vidhayak or saansad ke voton ke mulya kii lambii gananaa hoti hai
 The strength of the mla's vote is calculated to calculate the vote of the mlas of the state
 saath hi us rajya ke vidhansabha sadasyon kii sankhya ko bhi dekha jaataa he
 The ratio of vote to vote is divided by the number of mlas elected from the total population of the state
 iske baad jo ank nikalataa he, use phir 1000 se bhaag diya jaataa he
 Then the score is obtained, from that the ratio of the vote of an MLA of the state
 saansad ke vot kii taqatsaansadon ke maton ke mulya karne kaa tarika thodaa alag he
 First the value of the votes of all the mlas of the entire country is added
 joloksabhaa or rajyasabhaamein chune hue saansadon kii kul sankhya se bhaag diya jaataa he
 Then the marks obtained, the value of the vote of an MP of the state
 agar is tarah bhaag dene par shesh 0
 If there is more than 5 left then one increases in weightage
 voton kii ginatirashtrapati chunaav main ummidavaar kii jeet sirf sabase zyada vot hasil karne se nahin hoti, saath hi use saansadon or vidhayakon ke voton ke kul mulya kaa aadha se zyada hissaa hasil bhi karnaa padataa he
 In simple words, before the election it is decided how much votes or weightage the candidate must win
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi 10,000 vaid vot hai, to ummidavaar ko (10,000 / 2) +1 kii aavashyaktaa hogi, jo ki 5001 maton ke baraabar he
 What the points say? Mathematics? In the presidential election, 4120 mlas of legislative assemblies will vote in addition to 776 mps of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
 yani kul 4896 log milakar nayaa raashtrapati chunenge
 The total cost of these votes is 10 according to the process of presidential election
 98 lakh he
 What is the position of the government in presidential elections 5 to make BJP the President of its choice? 49 lakh keemat ke baraabar voton kii darkaar he
 Nearly 48 in the Electoral College related to presidential elections with ndas (including mps from 23 parties and members of state legislatures / legislative councils)
 64 fisadi vot hai
 BJP 5 lakh 32 thousand 19 but out of which about 20 thousand worth of votes belong to nda's allied parties
 yogi adityanath, keshav prasad maury or parrikar ke istife rukvakar bijepi ne 2100 voton kii kami puri kar lee he
 The BJP holds 12 out of the 29 states of the country
 bhaajapa ko milakar endie 15 rajyon par kabiz he
 The Opposition's position is the party like the Trinamool, including the Left's largest party, the Congress, the largest opposition party
 vipareet rajya yaa centre main raajnneetik samikarnon ke aadhaar par congress kii aguai vaale vipaksh ke saath ja sakane vaali 23 partiyon kaa vot pratishat 35

 2012 main film "vicky donor" jaisi film se bollywood main debyue karne vaale actorayushmaan khuranane ab tak 10 filmein kii hai
 Of these, 2 films have not been released, 4 of the remaining 8 films have been superhit
 ayushmaan kii filmon kaa chunaav dekhen to wo hameshaa riski vishyon par bani filmein karte rahete hai
 Though these are only stories of our society around us, but usually we do not tell it openly in homes
 ayushmaan ek baar phir 'badhai ho' ke jariye ek suni-sunai kahani main najar aaenge
 Congratulations Ho is such a story that it was not thought of before that a film can be made on this too
 darasal, jo mudde samaaj main tabu kii tarah dekhen jate hai un par ek saafe-suthri manoranjak film bananaa chunauteepurn kaam he
 But if we see Ayushmann's films made on similar subjects (vicky Donor, Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Shubh Mangal Savdhana and Bareilly Ki Barfi), then the story looks different
 jis gambhirtha, safai or manoranjak tareeke se ayushmaan kii filmon main tabu subjects dikhaa, laga ki ye to family cinema hi he
 The box office also gave proof of this
 logon ne apane parivaar ke saath film dekhi
 As a result, there was heavy rain on the ticket window
 ayushmaan ke kariyar main sabase dilachasp baat ye bhi he ki hameshaa aise content kii vajah se ye sitara box offis par baari padaa he
 The track record of his previous such films suggests that "badhaai Ho" will prove to be a big hit at the box office
 19 oktober ko film relies kiya janaa he
 Let us tell you what the story is, and how the films made on different stories of society were performed
 kya he ''badhai ho'' kii kahani?film menayushmaanke alaava sanya malhotra, nina gupta, gajraj raav ahm bhoomika main hai
 The film, directed by Amit r Sharma, is based on the pregnancy of an elderly woman
 utyub par "badhai ho" kaa trailor khub pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 The story of the film has been opened in the trailer
 ab kahani ke puure safar ko dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 The story has started - from a good news that came to Ayushmann's house
 ye khabar unhen unke pita dete hai ki ghar main nayaa mehmaan aane vaala he
 An attempt has been made to show in an entertaining way what is the attitude of society when an elderly woman with children is pregnant, how her own family and children react, how they face the society

 View this post on Instagram The makers had taken a huge risk by bringing the story of Ayushman's Vicky Donor, Dum Laga's Haisha and Shubh Mangal Savdhan on screen
 lekin audiyans ne samaaj ko aaina dikhaati in filmon ko hathohath liya tha
 All three films were critically acclaimed by critics and audiences
 vicky donor, sperm donor or infertility jaise ahm mudde par besd thi
 Ayushmannaki debut film Dum Laga Ke Haisha shows how parents marry a weighty girl without knowing the choice of a son for dowry
 ye bhi pahalu uthaaya gaya ki ayushmaan-bhoomi kii atpati jodi kaise samjhaute kii shaadi ko nibhaate hai
 The third film, Shubh Mangal Savdhani Ka Kahani, points to an important problem related to men (erectile dysfunction)

 Commendable indeed! - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) September 11, 2018 These films of Ayushmann spread awareness Aayushman mostly captures stories that are less talked about in the society
 in filmon main kamedi flavor ke saath darshakon ko bada massej diya gaya
 Whether it is sperm donor, mismatched marriage problem or disease like erectile dysfunction, these have been considered taboo in the society
 actor kii in filmon kaa screenple jabardast tha
 Showing a serious story in a comic style, giving a strong message is not a minor thing
 bhartiya commercial cinema main aisa dekha gaya he ki sanjeeda muddon par kamedi ke naam par ashleelata paros di jaati he
 But Ayushman's films which are being discussed, his story presentation was well appreciated
 in filmon ne hindi darshakon kii soch kaa dayera badhaane main madad kii
 At the same time awareness has spread in the society

 Sehwag has yet to get an aggressive start in the Test series against Sri Lanka, but he has not been able to stay at the crease for long to convert it into a long innings
 lekin dhoni se yah puche jane par ki kya sahvaag ko mangalvaar se shuru hone vaale duusare test main apni aakraamakata par lagaam kasne kii jarurat he to unhone iskaa jawaab nahin main diya
 Dhoni said, "you don't need to tell a player like that whether you do this or not
" vah isi tarah se cricket kheltaa he or isi ke liye mashhoor he
 He is an explosive batsman and not a player who will stay on the wicket for one and a half days
 ’’dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘ham chaahate hai ki sahvaag apana naiysargik khel khele
 He is a very experienced player and we do not need to tell him anything
 ’’ bharat shaayad sahvaag ko naiysargik khilne kaa jokhim uthaane kii chhot de saktaa he kyonki saathi salaami ballebaaj gambhir purna ballebaaj ke rup main nikhar gayi hai, jo apni naiysargik aakraamakata ko rokkar ghante tak krij par jame rah sakate hai, jiskaa najaara ahmedabad main pehle test main dekhne ko mila
 Dhoni praised Gambhir and said, "he is a great player
" use kisi bhi paristhitiyon main bhejo, vah usee ke mutabik khelegaa
 He can easily change tactics and uses his feet well against spinners
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘vah pichley ek dedh saal se lagaataar acchhee form main he or jab bhi team ko jarurat hoti he to vah badhiya kheltaa he
 Once it freezes it translates into a big innings
 ’’team ke sangyojan ke bare main dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘media main hameshaa yah mudda bana rahata he, lekin aapako mangalvaar tak intjaar karnaa hoga
 When asked about s Sreesanth during net practice, the captain said that the Kerala fast bowler is affecting, but he also defended Ishant Sharma
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘srisanth net par acchhee gendbaaji kar rahaa he
 He bowled at a pace and made it swing, but we have to wait till Tuesday
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘ishanth lay main vaapasi kar rahaa he, jaisaa ki hamane ahmedabad main dekha
 He is trying a lot and is showing improvement
 ’’dhoni ne pich ke bare main kaha, ‘‘motera kii tulana main yahaan kii pich alag dikh rahi he
 It has some grass and the base is dry
 lekin aap bhavishyavaanee nahin kar sakate ki agle paanch din main wicket kaisaa rahegaa
 "india's famous batting order looked weak in the morning session in Ahmedabad and Dhoni said he would have to be a little cautious
" dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘yah vyaktigat prayaas par nirbhar karata he
 With the help of fast bowlers, you get out on some good balls
 ’’ dhoni haalanki is baat se pareshaan he ki toss jitkar vah ballebaaji karen yaa phir gendbaaji
 He said, "the first session is important
 prayek din tej gendbaajon ke liye kuch na kuch rahegaa
 Even in odis we see that the first 30-45 minutes are important

 lok sabha chunaav memrahul gandhijis tarah narendra modi ko target karte rahe, dilli vidhansabha chunaav main bhi unhone ise barkaraar rakhaa
 On the other hand, this time the target of Prime Minister Modi was replaced by Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal
 yahaan humrahul gandhi ke bhaashanon sekuch aisi baaten de rahe hai jo unhone modi ke liye kahi he
 Some quick comments of Parmodi on Rahul's words -rahul Gandhi: 'I have always been fighting for the poor and the tribals
 'narendra modi: mitra! dekhiye aap yuvaraj hai
 Do you know what poverty is? kisi jhopadi main ek raat bitaa lene se na to ladaai ladi jaati he na garibi kaa dard samajha ja saktaa he
 i can understand poverty or my dear friend- Barack
 rahul gandhi: 'yahaan log ek-duusare se prem karte hai or unke bich ekta or sauhaard he, lekin unhen ladaaya jaataa he
 This is being done so that all kinds of benefits can be extended to 4 to 5 industrialists and the poor are left out
 'narendra modi: garibon ko ham nahin aap chhod aate hai yuvaraj
 How many homes have you photographed eating? Have you ever asked their condition after returning? Rahul Gandhi: 'now they put Jayanthi Natarajan up
 'narendra modi: mujhe kya garaj padi kisi ko khadaa karne kii
 Anyway, who is left to stand here? Like you, you probably stand because you have a mother
 yahi ek vajah he ki lok sabha chunaav baad maine aapako baksh diya, kyonki mere paas bhi maa he
 Rahul Gandhi: 'I had told Jayanti that tribals, environment and the poor should be taken care of
 'narendra modi: aapane to unhen apane adivaasiyon or garibon kii list bhi pakadaa di
 amazing
 rahul gandhi: 'kahaan gaya mek in india kaa naaraa
 Modi wears a suit of one million, that too is Make in UK
 'narendra modi: mitron ab inhen main kaise samajhaaun ki mujhe ‘maid in china’ bilkul bhi pasand nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi: 'prime Minister is doing PR
 lekin thos ek bhi kaam nahin hua he
 The public wants to know when things will stop and when work will start
 'narendra modi: aap rahane hi dijie sahab! aapako baat sunne kii aadat nahin he
 You even ban the speaking of a good good man
 rahul gandhi: 'unhone kaha tha ki vah bharat main kaala dhan waapas laaenge, or har kisi ke khate main 15 lakh rupee dalawaayenge
