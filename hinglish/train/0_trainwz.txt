 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 kya hoga agar supreme court koyala balox ke aavanton ko radd kar de
 Is there any legal or moral possibility of retaining the coal blocks allocated illegally? jis din yah faisla aayaa tha, us din cement, bijli or steel companiyon ke share girane lage the
 In the hope that investments of millions of crores of rupees may not fall into balance
 power companiyon ke share to saat pratishat tak gir gaye
 However, shares fall even when no decision is made
 25 agast ko jab supreme court ne kaha ki 1993 se 2010 ab tak jitne bhi kol blox aavantit hue sabhi avaidh hai
 During this time 218 coal blocks were distributed among 289 companies
 agar inke license radd ho gaye to zaahir he, 289 companiyon par asar pad saktaa he
 But this does not mean that all the companies have started taking coal mines and mining there
 keval 40 kol blaks main hi utpaadan shuru ho sakaa he
 Each company was given three to four and a half years to develop a coal mine
 magar 188 khadaanon main to koi utpaadan hi nahin hua
 So the cancellation of their license will definitely affect the companies
 magar koyala utpaadan yaa koyale se bijli utpaadan par kya asar padegaa
 Why not punish politicians who illegally obtained licenses from the nexus of bureaucracy and did not even produce
 jabaki sarkaron ne supreme court main yahi daleel di he ki bijli kaa utpaadan karne ke liye nae khilaadiyon ko protsaahit karnaa zaruri tha, taaki janata ko bijli mil sake
 But what happened
 bijli bhi sasti nahin hui, na bijli paidaa hui
 It is claimed that two and a half million MW plants are installed in India
 kabhi bhi bharat main ek lakh 35 hazaar megawatt se zyada bijli kaa utpaadan nahin hua
 Government companies like NTPC and NHPC contribute 90% of the power generation
 privet companiyon kaa yogadan vaise bhi kam he jinhen 1993 se protsaahit kiya ja rahaa he
 The bitter truth is that there is electricity, but our electricity boards do not buy because electricity is not available cheap
 agar aap yah soch rahe hai ki koyale kii kami se utpaadan nahin ho rahaa he, to iske jawaab main yah daawa kiya jaataa he ki koyale kii koi kami nahin he
 If you are ready to buy expensive electricity, then perhaps this shortage can be overcome immediately
 koyala utpaadan main privet companiyon kii hissedari kya he, 2013−14 main 54 karod ton koyale kaa utpaadan hua
 Private companies produced only 40 million tonnes of coal
 baaki pachaas karod kol india jaisi sawarjanik companiyon ne kiya
 This figure indicates that the cancellation of licenses will not affect coal production significantly
 magar chaar karod ton koyala bhi kam nahin hota he
 Especially when we imported 11 million tonnes last year
 ab sawaal uthta he ki kya saare kol blox aavanton radd kar die jaaen yaa jinamein khanan shuru nahin hua unke license radd hon yaa jo chal rahe hai un bhar baari jurmaana lage
 Coal blocks should be handed over to CIL
 yah bataaya gaya tha ki siiel to koyale ke utpaadan main sakasham nahin he, lekin privet companiyon ne hi koun si baazi maar lee
 An argument is made that the coal blocks awarded on the basis of first come first served policy also limited the possibility of CIL
 companiyon kaa daawa he ki do lakh 86 hazaar karod kaa nivesh ho chukaa he
 If the allocation is canceled, the investment environment will be affected and electricity will become more expensive
 lekin, kya isse pehle isaki chintaa nahin honi chahie ki sieji ne 1
 How to recover the estimated loss of 86 thousand crores
 aakhir desh kii janata ne bhi to ghaataa jhela he
 The government's answer in the Supreme Court stands in opposition to the logic of investment of companies, which claims that 2
 86 lakh karod main se 8800 karod hi kol blox par kharch hue
 Rest 2
 77 lakh karod cement, bijli or steel plant banane main lage
 This does not mean that all the money is spent in mines
 lekin, ye khadaan cement, bijli or steel ke utpaadan ke liye bhi die gaye the
 If we include cement and steel production, then the loss will not be huge due to cancellation of coal blocks
 ek block radd hoga to nayaa lene ke liye companiyon ko phir nivesh karnaa padegaa
 Then have to go through the auction process
 rahi baat bijli kii to uttar pradesh hi bijli kii kami se tadap rahaa he
 Love may be a jihad for politicians but electricity is the reason for the public
 agra main bijli kii lagaataar katautee se log sadakon par utarane lage hai
 There is a reduction of 12 to 16 hours daily, while the Supreme Court orders that Agra get 24 hours of electricity
 agra hi nahin kai zile bijli katautee se pareshaan hai
 Power is needed, but the way the coal industry is again going towards uncertainty, is it good? agar ham vikaas ke liye avaidh tareekon ko zaruri maan len to kya yah vahi daleel nahin hogi ki growth he to karpshan bhi he
 There was also an allegation that the companies who got coal blocks got a lot of money in the stock market, which companies took advantage of
 purv koyala sachiv pisi parakh bhi kehete hai ki license radd hue to desh kii arthvyavastha par asar padegaa
 Is it really going to affect? inke utpaadan na karne se desh kii arthvyavastha ko jo nuksaan hua he uski ginati kaise kii jaae
 How will the black money generated in the economy be counted in illegal allocation
 supreme court kya faisla karegaa, ham salaah nahin de sakate magar yah anumaan to laga hi sakate hai ki jo bhi faisla hoga uskaa kya asar hoga

 naukari karne vaale puure maheene mehnat karne ke baad maheene ke aakhri dinon main sabase zyada kis cheez kaa intjaar karte hai
 Obviously of his salary
 lekin notebandi or cashcrunch ke maujuuda daur main halaat kuch aise ban gaye hai ki selary mobile par to najar aegi, lekin haath main nahin
 From the beginning of December, banks start preparing to distribute salary
 aise main bainkon kii taiyaari kaa jayja lene ham noida atta market ke echdiefasi bank pahunche
 The situation here did not get any different from all other banks
 jin bainkon main cash he vahaan sarwar down kaa board laga he or jahaan sarwar durust he vahaan cash nadaarad
 Salary challenge for banks in December However, outside the bank we found Shiv Kumar waiting for cash
 kumaar indirapuram main rahete hai or buudhvaar ko jab unkisalarica massej unke mobile par flash hua to pehle wo indirapuram main bainkon main chakkar kaatane shuru kiye
 After getting this reply from all banks that go to his home branch, Kumar reached HDFC Bank in Atta Market, where he has a salary account
 lekin yahaan bhi unhen apane maheene bhar kii mehnat kii kamai kii pai bhi naseeb nahin hui
 Kumar says that from the beginning of the month, money is needed for out-of-home expenses, but here banks either have an excuse not to run the server or there is no cash
 selary acount main to dikhti he, haath nahin aa rahinaukareepesha logon kii jindagi maheene kii pehali taarikh se shuru hoti he or maheene kii aakhri taarikh aate aate saanse todane lagati hai
 The salary of ordinary people is not even 30 days of the month
 notebandi ke daur main sakhti kaa alam ye he ki maheene bhar mehnat kar logon ne jis selary kaa intjaar kiya, wo unkebank acountmen to he, lekin haathon tak nahin pahunchati
 However, as per rules, people can withdraw up to 24 thousand from their account every week
 lekin bank se jude sutron kaa kahana he ki shahari ilaakon main bhi zyaadaatar bank kii shakhaon main bees lakh pratidin se zyada nahin pahunch rahe
 In such a situation, do banks distribute cash to needy people and salary of salaried person? line main khadey rahidbhi to maheene kii shuruyaat bhi kaayade se nahin hui he
 Many companies also give their employees salary from 7th to 10th

 *** The way child abuse and child deaths have increased in the country, it is important that you teach your children the difference between good touch and bad touch
 dilli ke skulon or corporate houseej ke saath bataur kansaltent psychologist kaam kar raheen seemaa taneja ne kuch points die hai, jinhen follow karke aap bachche ko aisi sthitiyon main padhane se bachaa sakate hai-kis umr main bataaen kya sahi-kya galtahar bachche kii growth alag hoti he
 By the way, there is no definite age to teach such things
 bas ye dhyaan rakhana jaruri he ki use ye sab tab samajhaayen jab vah inhen samajhane ke laayak ho jaae
 If you want, you can start from a young age
 do yaa teen saal kii umr se hi, bachche ko khel-khel main yaa baton-baton main bataaen ki kahaan tach karnaa sahi he or kahaan galat
 The line between good and bad touch is very difficult to tell the child the body parts, where if someone touches even with love then it is stopped
 iske liye parents body ke un parts ke liye kisi naam kaa prayog karen jisase baccha use pahchaan paae
 For example, tell the child that the parts you wear swimsuits to cover cannot be touched except by the parents
 isse ve sharir ke bhaagon main bhed karnaa seekhenge
 It has often been seen that child molesters call children with love
 jisase baccha samaj nahin paata ki uskaa shoshan ho rahaa he ki wo vyakti unhen pyaar kar rahaa he
 Talk to the child It is very important to be friendly with the child
 aksar bachche apane mata-pita se aisi baaten chhipate hai, kehete hue darate hai
 But if you are a child friendly friend, then he will be able to tell you everything
 bachche ke badale vyavhaar ke prati bhi sachet rahen
 What to do if you have a bad touch? Teach the child that no means no
 bachche ko bataaen ki kisi bhi surat main ve body ports ko tach karne ke liye no hi kahenge
 Even if this happens to the child, they do not get scared and shout for help
 unhen bataaen ki unki ek aawaaj par kitne log unki madad ke liye pahunch jaaenge
 Also tell the child that they should see the situation and understand how to reach a safe place and shout or alarm
 ve hawaan se teji se bhaag sakate hai

 The importance of Mercury in the planets is very wide
 jyotish ke jaankaron kii agar maane to budh grah ke kamjor hone se insaan kii jindagi main kai sari samasyaayein aa jaati hai lekin agar kundali main budh balavaan ho to insaan ko kai sari khushiyon kii saugat mil jaati he
 So how does Mercury affect our lives? aaie jaanate hai
 
 
 Mercury is a small planet to be called, but in astrology, Mercury is counted and seen as an important planet
 ise devataaon kaa rajkumaar bhi kehete hai
 It has been said in astrology that if Mercury is correct then everything remains pure, but if this Mercury deteriorates, becomes inferior or turns away, then happiness worsens
 budh ke ashuddh hone kaa asar-to insaan kii jindagi main museebaton kaa pahaad tut padataa he
 -the person gets caught in the clutches of diseases
 sharir kii abha khatm hone lagati he
 - Begins troubled by debt and financially affected
 -budh kharaab hone par pad pratishtha, maan sammaan, yash bal sabase giravat aane lagati he
 -the person becomes weak in education, the power of smell decreases, he is not able to become effective through his words
 -buddhivaan hone ke anhakaar se grasit ho jaataa heiciilie kaha jaataa he grah koi bhi ho, chota ho bada ho
 Its influence cannot be underestimated by any other planet
 lekin agar budh sahi ho to jivan main khushiyon kii raushnee faili rahati he
 The darkness of sorrows stays away, the mind remains happy and peace prevails in life
 budh ke shuddh hone kaa prabhavabuddha ke shuddh hone se vyakti saundaryavan ho jaataa he
 His aura becomes unique, the person is a good speaker whose people like to listen carefully, usually the position of Mercury in the horoscope determines how a person speaks and behaves or his intelligence and personality
 How is it
 budh grah se balavaan vyakti agar vyapaar karata he to use khub safalataa milti he
 Especially in the stock market or rupee related business there is a special benefit
 budh aapke paksh main rahe to aapako maalamaal kar degaa
 You will be brought to infinite heights of the sky with fame, and if he turns his eyes on you, you can find Pai Pai
 aise main har insaan yahi chahega ki uskaa budh hameshaa shuddh rahe
 Keep a good eye on him
 lekin kaise aakhir kya karen ki buddha kii shuddh drushti hi ham par pade yaa agar budh kamjor ho to phir use kaise majboot karke jivan ko sanvaara ja saktaa he
 According to every zodiac sign, we will tell you that if Mercury is weak then what effect can it have on the zodiac and how life can be made happier by reducing the weak effect of Mercury on that zodiac
 kundali main budh agar kamjor ho to samasyaayein vyapak ho jaati hai
 Weakness of Mercury corrupts the intellect and impairs speech
 saath hi budh ke kamjor hone se insaan kii sundarataa bhi prabhavit hoti he lekin budh ke kamjor hone se kin raashi par kya khaas asar padataa he
 Let us now also tell you this
 
 
 chaliye ab aapako bataate hai ki budh grah agar kamjor ho to kis raashi par kya asar daalata he or usase kaise bachaa ja saktaa he, uskaa asar kaise kam kiya ja saktaa he
 
 
 Aries: There is a lot of problem in the job, there is also the fear of leaving the job, life is surrounded by debts and diseases
 vrish raashi: budh kaa khaasaa mahatv he
 Without good Mercury, life cannot be happy
 mithun raashi: jivan main sangharsh bad jaataa he, naukari main pareshaaniyaan ho sakati hai
 Cancer: Has a bad effect on health and also has a bad effect on travel
 charitra or buddhi badal jaati he
 The amount of waste increases in life
 singh raashi: majboot budh ke bina dhan kaa yoga nahin he
 Everybody has to yearn for money
 kanya raashi: swasthya par bura asar daalata he or dhan ghatane lagata he
 Beauty starts decreasing
 kariyar main baadha utpann hone lagati he
 Libra: Luck does not support and the mind becomes fickle
 charitra kamjor ho jaataa he
 Scorpio zodiac: achievement is not achieved despite merit
 twachaa yaa vaani se sambadhit vikaar ho saktaa he
 Sagittarius: There will be no problem in marriage or marriage, problems start in marital life
 makar raashi: insaan karj main dub jaataa he or naukari main baadha aati he
 Fate does not support kumbh raashi: buddhi kii samasya pareshaan karti he
 Children become problem additions from the side
 min raashi: jivan main kisi bhi prakaar kaa sukh nahin miltaa
 Marital life is ruined
 sampatti kaa nuksaan ho jaataa he
 Virat Brigade has been upbeat with an unprecedented 9–0 win in Sri Lanka tour
 ab team india ko australian chunauti kaa saamana karnaa he
 The first ODI of the series of five odis will be played on 17 September in Chennai
 yaheen mangalvaar ko kangaaroon ne jamkar abhyaas kiya or board president ilevan ko 103 ranon se haraaya
 India will definitely get home advantage in this series, but the competition against the Kangaroos will not be easy
 najar daalate hai viraat brigade ke liye yah siries asli pariksha kyon maani ja rahi he
 1
 bharat kii paristhitiyon se anjaan nahin kangaroo14 sadasyeey australian squad main 8 aise khilaadi hai, jo bharat kii paristhitiyon se waakif hai
 Above all, David Warner, Aaron Finch, Glenn Maxwell and James Faulkner have shown their strength in the IPL
 saath hi bharat daure par ipel ke dauraan saal main kareeb 50 din bitaye hai
 Barring Guwahati, these players are not unaware of the circumstances of Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Nagpur, Indore and Ranchi, where the matches will be held in this series
 2
 The Indian spin attack has little experience with both Indian spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja topping the Test rankings, but they have not performed well in odis
 kai baar to aswin ke hisse ek bhi wicket nahin aayaa
 On the other hand, talking about Jadeja, he did not bowl even during the Champions Trophy
 donon ab team se baahar hai
 Akshar Petal, Yajuvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav have less chances
 in teenon ke kam anubhav team ke aade aa sakate hai
 3
 spin par haath kholane main peeche nahin australianstive smith spin ke jabardast ballebaaj ke rup main ubhare hai
 In such a situation, his batting technique can be overwhelming against the spinners
 spin ke aage maxwell bhi khud ko roak nahin pate hai
 Other batsmen of the team can also open their hands on the spin
 vaise australian sheersh ballebaaji kram main shaamil david warner, aron finch or steve smith kisi bhi akraman kii dhajjiyaan uda sakate he
 4
 badi tiimon ke khilaaf viraat brigade kaa khelnaa bakichampions trophy ke dauraan australian team ko mausam kii maar jhelni padi
 On the other hand, India and Bangladesh in the Champions Trophy
 africa jaisi tiimon kaa saamana kiya, jo us vakt apni oonchaaiyon par nahin the
 Still Sri Lanka and Pakistan had exposed the weak link of India during that time
 iske baad team india ne westeindies or srilanka ko unke ghar main jarur maat di, jo timen bilkul kharaab daur se guzar rahe hai
 5

 According to a printing press in Kuchamancity in Nagaur district, now the first demand of Dalit customers is to put a picture of Ambedkar in the card
 mularoop se dausa nivasee or ab jaipur main rah rahe 34 varshiya satyendra murali kehete hai, "isse pehle amuman maharashtra or upi main hi daliton main is tarah ke trend najar aate the
 But in Rajasthan in the last two-three years, Dalits have also got such new consciousness and they are also registering cultural resistance through the traditions of marriage
 '' satyendra ne bhi do saal pehle apni shaadi ke card main ambedkar or buddha ke chitra prakashit karwaae the
 Not only this, they also fixed the date of their wedding as Ravidas Jayanti
 haal main essi-asti act par supreme court ke faisle or 2 april ke bharat band main bhi daliton ke pratirodh kii tivrata kii jhalak mili
 After this movement, this trend has become more intensified in the Dalit society
 shaadi card par hindu devtaa ganesh kii jagah ambedkar ne lee he
 More than two hundred such cards have been printed after 2 April
 satyendra ke mutabik, pradeshbhar main aise cardon kii sankhya isse bhi zyada hogi
 He says, "earlier this trend was seen only in isolated families associated with a political party
 par ab jansamanya main bhi yah trend ubhar gaya he
 In fact, since the Supreme Court's decision, resentment among Dalits has increased and is coming out in these cultural forms as well
 satyendra ke mutabik, tasveeron ke alaava shaadi-card par buddha vandana bhi likhavai jaati he
 Not only this, in addition to marriage, this trend is seen in the ways of getting Ambedar and Buddha Vandana etc
 is muhim kii aguai dalit samaaj kaa padhaa-likhaa or jaagruk tabaka karata dikh rahaa he
 a family of lecturers, senior teachers and bsf-working families are to be married at Budsu village in Nagaur district and have written Ambedkar's picture on the wedding card and Jai Bhim below
 dilachasp ki inke card main ek taraf ganesh bhi virajman hai
 But Ganesh is not depicted in a wedding card from the nearby Safed Badi village
 trek driveron vaale is parivaar ke ek shaks ne bataaya, "ab hamaari chetana jaagrit ho chuki he
 "most of the people of this society say that their God is Ambedkar," the rest is "grandstanding"
 rajasthan ke kuch hisson main savarna shaadi-vivaah ke dauraan daliton ke ghode par savaar hone (ghudchadhi) kaa virodh karte rahe hai
 The state ranks third in the country with 5,134 incidents of crime against Dalits
 haal hi main bhilwara ke govardhanpura gaanv main savarnon ne dalit duulhe kii ghudchadhi karne par pitayee kii
 So has such discrimination on the part of the upper castes motivated the Dalits to adopt such things? Social activist Bhanwar Meghvanshi says, "yes, this is also a reason
 par badi vajah yah he ki jansamanya main jaagrukta ai he
 Because of this, Dalits are joining the path told by their great men instead of Brahminical pomp
 yah trend gaanvon-kasbon main shuru hua or shaharon main bhi najar aa rahaa he
 According to him, there has also been an increase in the trend of Dalits putting blue flags in front of their homes
 ve is nai chetana kii vajah bataate hai, "dalit yuva aaj aajeevika ke liye sthaneey logon par nirbhar nahin rah gaya he
 He is no longer a farm laborer but is also working in cities
 so usamen pratirodh kii kshamta or jaagrukta ai he
 In Jodhpur, a bank manager put Mahatma Buddha's photo and verses of Buddhism on his son's wedding card
 udaipur jile ke bijli vibhaag ke adhikari ke parivaar main ho rahi shaadi ke card par buddha se lekar jyotiba phule or kanshiram ko prakashit karvaa kar nyauta bheja gaya he
 At the same time, on the wedding card of the son of a retired officer of Jaipur district, "let us not forget our great men and our history" has also been printed
 shaadi-vivaah ke card par chhapane vaale aise mahapurushon main sant kabir or sant ravidaas bhi shaamil hai
 Dharmendra Kumar Jatav, who works for the underprivileged in Rajasthan, says, "social media has also helped to increase the trend of such cultural resistance
 aaj dalit yuva majbootee se khud ko abhivyakt kar rahaa he or pratirodh ke vibhinn tareeke apana rahaa he
 It is also part of the same
 '' unhone haal hi main team rajasthan naamak plateform khadaa kiya he, jisamen gujarat ke jignesh mewaani ko bhi aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 According to Dharmendra, today the youth gets instantly connected to whatsapp-facebook etc
 and gets connected with people from all over the country, whether in Maharashtra, UP or elsewhere
 ve is tarah ke trend ke viksit hone main ise behad ahm maanate hai
 Obviously, this is also the method of rebellion that emerged among the Dalits regarding Hinduism
 jodhpur ke jainaran vyas vishvavidhyalay main manovigyaan ke professor dow
 Arvind Parihar says, "fear of loss of their rights, protests are now moving the Dalit class towards a separate creed
 ''jaahir he, ve ise daliton kii ore se hindu dharm se itar alag panth khadaa karne ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 He says, "the consequences of this trend may be severe in the coming years
 '' hindu dharm kii saamaajik sanrachana main dikh rahe is badlaav par isi vishvavidhyalay ke samajashastri camel singh rathod kehete hai, "yah sari jaddojahad varchasv ko lekar he, pehle padmavati ke virodh main rajput aae or ab asuraksha ke bhay se dalit
 “there is also anger among Dalits about their leaders
 unke mutabik, essi-asti act par faisle ke baad netaaon ne kuch nahin kiya, unki aankh 2 april ke bharat band se khuli
 Tulsidas Raj, who led the Bharat Bandh in Jodhpur, says, "in the Vedic period, Dalits were not considered part of Hinduism
 aane vaale dinon main dalit samaaj hindu dharm main apni nai disha tay karegaa
 Now the Dalits have woken up and getting a picture of Babasaheb Ambedkar on the wedding card is a hallmark of this awakening
 ''jodhpur hycourt ke vakil ke
 L
 chouhan kii raay bhi aisi hi he
 According to him, the marriage card is the beginning of a revolution and now the Dalit society has become educated
 ve kehete hai, "dalit baba sahib kii kahi baat "mandiron kii taraf nahin, pustakaalayon kii taraf jaao'' kaa anusaran kar rahe hai
 Dalits went to temples and saw nothing
 jo diya baba sahib ne diya
 Now the society will only run on Baba Saheb's words
 '' yah pratirodh sirf vivaah paramparaon tak nahin balki rajnatik taur par bhi dikh rahaa he
 The Dalits who were arrested during the Bharat Bandh of April 2 are being welcomed strongly on release
 vahiin satyendra, dharmendra or bhavar meghavanshi jaise logon kaa maananaa he ki in ghatnakramon ne daliton ke aapasi matbhedon ko bhi khatm kiya he or unhen ekajute kiya he
 The successful Bharat Bandh of Dalits has also appalled the BJP government
 vah unhen lubhaane kii koshish bhi kar rahi he
 On 14 April, Vasundhara Raje government started construction of Ambedkar Bhawan in all the municipalities of the state
 lekin daliton kii naaraazgi kam hoti nahin dikhaai de rahi he

 Dwivedi's advocacy to abolish caste-based reservation has come at a time when the Congress is emphasizing on minority sub-quota, supporting reservation in promotions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and in favor of reservation for Jats Is visible congress mahasachiv dvivedi ne kaha, 'yah (jati ke aadhaar par aarakshan) samaapt ho janaa chahie tha
 Why this has not happened yet, because the vested selfish elements came into the process
 kya daliton or pichhadon main sabhi ko aarakshan kaa laabh miltaa he? yah sab upar waalon ko miltaa he
 There is a difference between social justice and casteism

 53-year-old Jaswant Singh, a taxi driver from Delhi, suffered a double blow last year
 rashtriya harith nyaayaadhikaran (engiti) ne april, 2015 main pradooshan ko niyantrit karne ke liye jab dilli main das saal se zyada puraane dijal vaahanon par bandish lagaai, tab jaswant ko apni taxi kodiyon ke bhav bechni padi
 He then borrowed and bought an old Tata Indigo diesel car and joined a taxi service
 badakismati kaa hamalaa ek baar phir hua jab engiti ne rashtriya rajdhani main sabhi dijal kaaron par roak laga di
 Later, the Supreme Court amended the ban to include most luxury segment cars with a capacity of only 2,000 cc, while ordering all taxis to be converted into clean fuel CNG by March 2016
 ek car main sienji kit lagane kaa kharchaa 65,000 se 70,000 ru
 Falls between jaswant ke liye yah mahangaa sauda he jinaki kamai rojaanaa 1,000 ru
 Is less than
 jaswant kaa uhapoh bataata he ki pradooshan failaane vaale dijal kaa vikalp khojna kitna mahangaa sauda sabit ho saktaa he, haalanki aisa karnaa hi hoga
 The Supreme Court's directive is being seen as the end of diesel-powered cars in metros where widespread smoke, air pollution and lung diseases have caused a resentment against diesel among people
 gaur talab he ki aktubar 2015 main bharat main dijal kii khapat 16 fisadi badhkar 6
 Reached 34 MT, 5 the year before
 45 amti hua karti thi
 This is the maximum value after August 2005
 dilli kii sadakon par rojaanaa ausatan 50,000 dijal texiyaan chalati hai jo 10 lakh litre dijal jalaati hai
 a ban on these will shake the cries of many families like Jaswant

 If 2 lakh private diesel cars are added, then the problem of inflexibility is realized
 vaahan nirmaataa companiyon kii is nirdesh ko di gai chunauti par supreme court ne 5 janvari ko unhen raahat dene se inkaar kar diya or nai lagjri dijal kaaron par pratibandh ko kaayam rakhaa he
 Not only this, the court questioned the government's need to use diesel cars which are more than five years old and also prepared the ground to remove them from the roads

 Inspired by his teacher's father's emergency opposition, a mere 14-year-old boy experienced the "democracy of democracy" for the first time in his life in March 1977, when the bbc's Hindi service reported a massive Congress defeat
 yah ek saarvajanik ullas kaa kshan tha
 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had lost the election and her son and successor Sanjay Gandhi had also lost her seat
 haalanki kuch hi samay baad janata party ke bikharane ke kaaran ghor niraashaa kaa daur bhi shuru ho gaya
 After the internal discord and division of the Janata Party, the first real opportunity for any kind of political change after the independence of the country was finally over
 aaj us ghatana ke takreeban saadhe teen dashak baad 52 varsh ke yogendra yadav yah sochakar pareshaan hai ki aam aadmi party (aap) kii chamatkaari safalataa se utsahit hajaaron yuva aaj gusse main hai or usee tarah thaga hua mahasoos kar rahe hai, jaise morarji desai kii sarkaar ke girane ke baad unhen mahasoos hua tha
 Yogendra Yadav, who was reportedly ousted from the party for allegedly trying to end the disagreement of AAP national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, has no more reason to remain in the party
 unhen sabase zyada yah sachaai kachot rahi he ki ''aaj kii kahani main ham gaddaar hai
 Today we are finding ourselves standing where Desai, Charan Singh, Rajnarayan and Chandrasekhar stood in 1979
 ''mridubhashi or milansaar yadav se, jinhen ek dost ne ''gahan vichaaron se bhare-puure shashi tharur'' tak kaha, jhagaduya asambhav-sa jaan padataa he
 Meeting them always creates the feeling that they can be trusted
 yah sahajata or man kii shanti unhen bachapan ke ''niyaswaarth pyaar bhare gharelu maahaul'' or academik jagat main bitaye gaye varshon se hasil hui he
 He started his journey in the academic world in 1987 from the Department of Politics of Punjab University
 baad main ve dilli ke centre for da studies of develping societies (siesds) se jude
 Meanwhile, he tried his hand at election analysis
 bharat ke behad uljhe chunavi paridrishy main bhavishyavaanee karne ke vyavsaay ko kuch or dhardaar banaaya, vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog main niti-nirmaan main madad kii or rashtriya shiksha shodh or prashikshan parishad (ensiiarti) kii paathya-pustakon ko nayaa rup dene keliye bhi kaam kiya
 But he has been away from all these academic works since the founding of AAP in 2012 and does not even intend to return to it
 raajnneeti main utarane kaa yah sankraman kaa daur aasaan nahin rahaa he? ve kehete hai, ''vaaki (sankraman) aasaan nahin tha
 Apart from college classrooms and TV studios, Yadav has also been associated with socio-political movements
 ve kehete hai, ''main kabhi vishuddh academik jagat kaa praani nahin rahaa, balki main hameshaa se ek rajnatik jeev rahaa hum, jo raajnneeti vigyaan ke sansar main ummid se zyada hi tikaa rahaa
 From the beginning of 1983 at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, he became active in the Samata Yuvjan Sabha and joined with Rammanohar Lohia's associate, Odisha's Socialist leader Kishan Patnaik
 1995 main jab patnayak ne samaajawaadee jan parishad kaa gathan kiya to yadav ne uskaa niti dastavej taiyaar kiya
 But it was only after the decision to join AAP that he entered politics completely
 haalanki ve yah bhi khulaasa karte hai ki party kii sthapana ke samay se hi kejariwal se matbhed ubharne lage the
 He says, "at the time of the formation of the party, i started to realize that Arvind felt uncomfortable with my presence
" '' ve aisi kai ghatnaayen yaad karte hai
 For example, in early 2012, the vision document produced by Yadav was rejected by Kejriwal in a jolt
 phir aap ke gathan ke saath desh bhar main yatraaen karne kii yadav kii salaah bhi nahin maani thi
 Still he remained active in the party because "it has always been my opinion that relationships in public life are complicated and you cannot be part of any team if you cannot play them
" aise main saarvajanik jivan main rahane kaa koi auchity bhi nahin he
 However, his differences with Kejriwal were sharpened only when Kejriwal intended to re-form the government in Delhi after re-aligning with the Congress after the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 party main kejariwal or unke samarthakon ke saath rishte ''kathin or tanaavpurn ho gaye or prashanth bhushan ke maamle main asambhav kii had tak ja pahunche
 "yet Yadav kept trying to keep the relationship as long and lasting as possible
 khaskar farvari, 2015 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaavon tak, jisamen unke bheetar kaa chunaav vishleshak dekh saktaa tha ki ''arvind ne loksabhaa chunaav kii haar kii niraashaa ko aap kii nishchit jeet main badal diya he
 "now he is almost out of you, but Yadav, he has absolutely no intention of returning to the academic world
" unhone india today se ek april ko kaha, ''ab tak meraa jivan usee kii taiyaari main laga rahaa he, jahaan main aaj hum
 So i do not intend to leave it so soon
 is maujuuda jatke se to ekadam nahin
 They also state that they have already extended their leave from CSDS for a year
 yadav sweekaar karte hai ki unhen yaa bhushan kaa aage kii raah ke bare main koi spasht vichaar nahin he

 Navjot Singh Sidhu, who has come from cricket to politics, has reached Lahore on Friday to attend the swearing-in ceremony of his friend and Imran Khan, who is going to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan
 nila suut or gulabi pagadi pahane siddhu wagha seemaa ke jariye lahore pahunche jahaan se vah islamabad jaayenge
 The oath taking ceremony is to be held in Islamabad
 netaa nahin dost banakar ayasiddhu ne pakistan ke loktantr main chunaav ke baad aaye badlaav kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki imran ko donon deshon ke bich aman kii bahaali kii pahal kerani chaiye 
 He said that he has come to Pakistan with the message of love as a good ambassador of India
 unhone kaha,‘main yahaan rajaneta ke rup main nahin balki dost ke rup main aayaa hum
 i have come here to participate in the happiness of my friend (imran)
 ’cricketer se rajaneta bane siddhu ne kaha,‘hindustan jiven, pakistan jiven
 He said that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee also used to talk about peace between the two countries
 yaha bataa den ki vipakshi dalon kii ore se siddhu par atal bihari kaa vaajapeyi kaa antim sanskaar chhod imran ke shapath grahan ke liye pakistan jane par sawaal bhi uthaae gaye hai
 On reaching the special gift for Imran, Sidhu said that if there is a fire in the neighbor's house, then the heat will also come on us
 imran ke bare main unhone kaha,‘maine use apni kamajori ko apni takat banaate dekha he, main dua karata hum ki imran apane desh ke liye samruddhi kaa parichaayak ban jaye
 "asked what gift he has brought for the former Pakistan cricket captain, he said," i have brought a Kashmiri shawl for Khan Sahib
 ’ isse pehle purv captain sunil gavaskar ko bhi samaaroh main bulaayaa gaya tha lekin unhone nijee kaarnon se nyote ko thukraa diya tha
 Sunil Gavaskar said that due to the busyness of his commentary, he cannot attend this oath ceremony
 haalanki unhone bhavishya main unase mulaakaat kii ummid jataai
 Imran Khan also invited Kapil Dev and Sidhu, captain of the Indian cricket team that won the World Cup in 1983
 pradhanmantri narendra modi aaj desh ke satta pratishthan ke agua hai
 Even though a new feudal class has emerged from this change, the Prime Minister himself is not giving any clear indication
 sab asamanjas main or satark hai
 These include those who were considered to be very close to Modi and very close to him
 isaki ek misaal bhartiya van seva ke 1988 batch ke adhikari bharat laal hai
 He is the local commissioner of Gujarat Bhavan in Delhi
 unhen modi kaa dahinaa haath mana jaataa tha lekin ve ab pradhanmantri karyaalay se baahar hai
 Sources say that they have undoubtedly direct access to Modi, due to which the corridors of power corridors in Delhi are surprised whether Bharat Lal is still in the intimate circle
 kuch din pehle tak aisa koi andeh nahin tha
 Bharat Lal was considered a confidant of Modi, who was holding Delhi for him
 aam chunaav main modi kii jeet ke baad bharat laal ne hi america ke raashtrapati baraak obama sahit vishwa netaaon ke badhai ke phone modi ke kaan tak pahunchaae
 The candidates for access to the court are not yet able to understand Lal's true status
 bheetar ke logon kaa kahana he ki bharat laal ko koi nishchit aadesh nahin mili hai
 He was given an interim message to join the Prime Minister's Office for a month
 yah sandesh bhi tab diya gaya tha jab nripendra mishra ne pradhanmantri kaa pramukh sachiv banane par tay kiya ki kuch sarkari sweekruti di jaani jaruri he kyonki cabinet sachiv ajit seth shuru ke dinon main cabinet kii baithak ke agenda sahit sabhi sandesh bharat laal ke madhyam se hi bhej rahe the
 The general belief was that when Bharat Lal would become joint secretary after one month, he would be appointed as the personal secretary to the Prime Minister or would be given some important post
 lekin asaliyat main aisa kuch nahin hua or ek saptaah avkaash par rahane ke baad bharat laal waapas gujarat bhawan main sthaneey ayukta karyaalay main pahunch gaye
 He may get a better position in future, but at present, Modi has appointed Sanjeev Singla, a 1997 batch Foreign Service officer, as his second private secretary, so that the need of his personal staff has been fulfilled at present
 iske vyapak asar par gaur karen to sandesh saaf he ki koi bhi modi se apni nikatataa ko guarantee ke taur paar nahin le saktaa he or ve apni saakh yaa sambandhon kii parvaah kiye bina yah sanket dene main jaraa bhi nahin hichakate
 He now has two principal secretaries in his own office
 pi
 K
 mishra ko atirikt pramukh sachiv kaha jaataa he par ve nripendra mishra kii tarah sidhe pradhanmantri ko report karte hai or mantrimandal kii niyukti samiti (asisi) kaa sara kaam sambhalate hai
 It is a coincidence that Home Minister Rajnath Singh, another member of the ACC, sees the file when she returns after the Prime Minister's decision
 iskaa matlab yah he ki afasaron kii sari niyuktiyaan modi khud karte hai
 Effective ministers like Finance Minister Arun Jaitley are also very careful in their appointments
 ve acchhee tarah jaatne hai ki faisla sirf pradhanmantri karyaalay karegaa
 Officers in the private staff of ministers of the UPA government see the effect of the cancellation of appointments as private secretaries
 ab mantri apane prastaav bhejne se pehle har tarah se nishcint hone kii koshish kar rahe hai
 For example, the appointment of Shaktikanta Das to the post of Revenue Secretary was considered absolutely safe, as the presentation he made to the Prime Minister as fertilizer secretary was considered the best
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke jamaane main kisi ko koi bhi kaam karaane ke liye brajesh mishra kaa sahaara lenaa padataa tha
 Modi has not given this right to any one person
 pramukh sachiv nripendra mishra apane puraane saathi aar
 N
 choube ko pradhanmantri karyaalay main laana chaahate the
 The order was also issued, but was withdrawn at the last minute
 tamaam apekshaaon ke vipareet manmohan singh ke pradhanmantri karyaalay main sachiv aar
 Ramanujam was given service extension
 haalanki modi ke rukh main ek tarah kii taratamyata he or agar kahin koi pakshpaat dekhne ko miltaa he to vah afasaron ke haq main hi hota he
 Sometimes cabinet ministers have to face the trouble
 masalan, ek varisht mantri ko baithak ke liye bulaae jane ke baad ek ghanta intjaar karavaaya gaya or aakhir yah kah diya gaya ki baithak tal gai he
 This simply means that the dilemma of status and power is going on in the court, but there is no clear indication from the palace
 modi duuri banaae rakhte hai, isliye sidhe un tak yaa unke man kii baat jaanane vaale kisi vyakti tak pahunchane vaali kaalpanik door ko pakadaaey ke icchhuk sabhi log asamanjas main rahete hai
 Fire brand leader Sadhvi Prachi of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has once again targeted SP leader Azam Khan
 sadhvi ne kaha he ki ajam kii johar uniwarsity aatankwaad kaa adda he centre sarkaar ko uniwarsity kii jaanch karaani chahie
 Sadhvi also alleged that terrorism has increased in western Uttar Pradesh ever since the MIN leader Owaisi stepped into the land of UP
 mayawati par bhi baraseen sadhvi prachibareli pahunchi sadhvi ne kaha kiajam khanaatankwaad ko sangrakshan de rahe hai is dauraan sadhvi ke radar par bispi kii mukhiya mayawati par raheen
 Sadhvi said Mayawati is the daughter of Daulat and she uses Dalits only as vote bank
 sadhvi ne patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue bhi kaha ki upi main bijepi kii sarkaar banegi sapa sarkaar main gunda rajya he
 The officers are being killed, there is no one to listen to the public in the state
 ajam khan ne kiyasanton kaa apmansadhvi ne kaha ki uttar pradesh sarkaar ne ajam khan ko santon kshapamanitkarne ke liye hi chhod rakhaa he
 The government should have sacked Azam Khan and put him in jail on the very day he threw mud on the saints
 dilli ke gita colony ilaake se insaaniyat ko sharamshaar karne vaali ek ghatana samaane ai he
 Where the policemen (delhi Police) were engaged in collecting money from their families instead of taking the injured young man to the hospital
 ghatana 19 janvari kii he
 Police officer investigating the case (delhi Police) said that on the night of January 19, Dharmendra's car hit the Delhi Police's barricades in the Kotwali area
 iske baad police (delhi Police) se bachane ke liye dharmendra dar kar maukey se apni gaadi lekar maukey par roke bagaiyr nikal gaya
 After which four police personnel of Kotwali area were chasing Dharmendra's car
 peechha karne ke kram main unhone dekha ki dharmendra kaa tampon gita colony floweover par palat gaya he
 After this, he took the injured out of the tampons and left him in a bled condition on the road too
 iske baad aaropee pulicekarmiyon ne ghayal chaalak ke parijanon ko kolkar bulaayaa
 The family members of the deceased alleged that the four policemen demanded Rs 10,000 from him
 is dauraan parijanon ne ghayal ko aspataal lekar jane kii baat kahi to pulisavaalon ne pehle paise lekar aane ko kaha
 After receiving the money, the accused policemen handed over the injured to family members at four in the morning
 lekin tab tak kaaphi der ho chuki thi
 Earlier, he had died while reaching the hospital with the injured
 is maamle ke saamne aane ke baad dilli police ne chaaron aaropee police karmi ke khilaaf vijalence jaanch shuru kar di he
 So far, two accused policemen have been suspended under investigation
 gauratlab he ki is tarah kaa yah koi pehla maamla nahin he
 a few years ago, a similar case was reported from Mumbai
 jahaan raat ke andhere main kuch pulicekarmi ek hotel main daakhil hue the
 It is alleged that he had beaten up the hotel workers badly to avenge the clash with his partner
 is maamle main teenon pulisavaalon ko nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 It happened that the hotel staff clashed with a policeman posted at Shahu Nagar police station in the 50-year-old Sandesh Hotel
 hotelkarmiyon kaa kahana tha ki aaropee pulisavaala hotel ke baahar saadi vardi main sharaab pine ke baad faluda kha rahaa tha
 The hotel workers were laughed at seeing him, on such an issue, a quarrel had started on both sides
 hotel waalon ko pataa nahin tha ki aaropee pulicekarmi he, lihaaza baat badhane par unhone bhi use peet diya
 After this the policeman entered the back door of the hotel with his colleagues and they started brutally beating the hotel workers
 marpet main 4-5 hotel staff ko gambhir chot ai thi
 This whole incident was captured in the CCTV camera installed in the hotel, which showed how the policemen broke in and broke the lock from the back door of the hotel

 Subsequently, on 14 December 2014, the CBI arrested Madan Mitra, who was said to be close to Mamata Banerjee, who was then Transport Minister in the Mamta government
 madan mitra kai maukon par sharada group ke kaaryakramon main ghotaale ke mastermind sudipto sen kii tarifen karte rahe the
 In the Saradha scam, the CBI also arrested Rajat Majumdar, the former DGP of West Bengal, who is currently the vice-president of TMC and is on a sit-in with Mamta in September 2014
 sibiai ke mutabik rajat majumdaar sharada group ke liye sicurity adwiser ke taur par kaam kar chuke hai
 In 2016, the name of TMC vice-president and MP Mukul Roy was also revealed in a sting operation related to the Saradha scam, after which he was also questioned by the CBI
 iske baad mamata banerjee ke daahine haath kahe jane vaale mukul roy ne bijepi kaa daaman tham liya
 Rojwali scam: After the Saradha scam, another such chit fund scam came to the headlines in Bengal, which made headlines in the name of Rojwali scam
 roj vaili chitfund ghotaale main roj vaili group ne logon se do alag-alag skim kaa laalach diya or aam logon kaa paisa hadap liya

 While Sudeep Bandopadhyay was the second TMC MP arrested in this case in January 2017
 tiemasi saansad mukul roy kaa naam rosevaili ghotaale main bhi saamne aayaa tha
 From the Saradha scam to the Rojwali scam, Mamta Banerjee, who had been restraining the arrests of TMC leaders, ministers and mps, never staged a sit-in against the central government
 lekin jab police kamishnar rajeev kumaar ke paas sibiai pahunchin to mamata banerjee dharne par baith gayi
 Now the BJP is raising the question as to what are the secrets Rajiv Kumar has on which Mamata Banerjee has come down the road to cover the curtain
 kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki jab tiemasi ke bade netaa jail gaye tab mamata banerjee ne dharna nahin diya lekin police kamishnar ke liye wo dharne par baithi hai, police kamishnar ke paas aisa kya he jise chupaane ke liye mamata banerjee sadak par baithi hai
 He said that this is the first time that the Chief Minister is saving a police commissioner
 is par mamata banerjee kaa kahana he ki meri party ke netaaon ko jail main rakhaa gaya
 i also endured this insult
 main rajya kii mukhiya hum to meraa ferj he ki sabaki raksha karun

 beauty products or gharelu upayon se jude dheron artical aapane padhe honge
 In which it is claimed that by doing this remedy, your skin will become beautiful and youthful, hair will become black and thick
 par ye baat to aap bhi jaanate hi honge ki in beauty products main jamkar chemicals kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Due to which there can be a lot of damage to the hair
 hamaari twachaa or baalo par in chemicals ke alaava suraj kii roshni, dhul, pradooshan or gandagi kaa bhi bura asar padataa he lekin shaayad hi aapako pataa ho ki aapkaa takiya bhi aapaki khubsuurati main daag lagane kaa kaam karata he
 Know how your beauty is taking away your pillow
 
 
 twachaa ke lieshayad aap yakeen nahin kar paaen lekin jis takie par aap sir rakhkar sote hai wo aapaki soch se kai guna ganda hota he
 The pillow consists of sticking oil, dust, hair and other fibers in our head
 aise main jab hamaari skin takie ke sampark main aati he to ye kan hamaare porce main chale jate hai, jisase wo band ho jate hai
 Also when we sleep at night our skin rubs between the skin and the pillow

 Change the pillow every six months
 takiya jitna mulaayam hoga utana hi behatar
 Apart from this, tie the hair while sleeping at night
 haalanki bahut tite chotii yaa ban na banaaen
 Also keep the pillow cover clean regularly
