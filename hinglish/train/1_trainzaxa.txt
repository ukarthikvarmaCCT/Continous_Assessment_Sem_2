 ek may se 12 may tak pradhanmantri narendra modi ne rajya kaa tufaani daura kiya or kareeb do darjan reliyon ko sambodhit kiya

 The result is now in front of the country, Prime Minister Modi's magic has also fallen on the people of Karnataka and he has handed over the command to the BJP, ousting the ruling Congress

 As the investigation of the murder of Gitanjali, the wife of a judge of Gurgaon, is proceeding, new revelations are not only happening, but the family members of Gitanjali are also making new allegations against the judge, in the moment, this murder Three theories are coming out about the mystery and the police is investigating the matter by keeping the same theory in front of you, you know the theory of the son's desire, two new theories have come out
 He is both concerned about the relationship of Judge Saheb and also of Gitanjali
 kya police line park main koi bedadak chah goli chalaa saktaa he? kya park main tahalne ke liye koi loded revolver lekar nikal saktaa he? kya koi katl karne ke liye supaari killer ko apana hi bharaa hua revolver de saktaa he? or kya koi peshwar killer bilkul kareeb se bhi teen nishaanaa chook saktaa he? sirf bete kii chahat main maari gai gitanjali? yaa katl ke peeche he rishton kaa pher? kya sijeem kaa tha kisi or se rishta? yaa rishte ke liye blackmel kii ja rahi thi gitanjali? kiraye ke kaatil ne chalaai gitanjali par goli? apane hi jaanane vaale ne maari gitanjali ko goli? yaa phir jhagade ke baad chali goli? gitanjali kaa jaanane vaala tha kaatil? yaa phir sijeem kaa kareebi tha kaatil? yaa phir sijeem kaa dushman tha kaatil? in tamaam sawaalon ne cese ko ulajhaa diya he
 Even after five days of the murder of a judge's wife, the face of the murderer or the motive of the murder could not be revealed, but yes, in this list of questions of what, why, how and who, the work of finding the slayer is definitely going on
 On the fifth day of the murder, an important clue and two secrets have definitely come to the fore, that two bullet kiosks have been found from the park in which Gitanjali was killed, that is, the kiosks prove that the slaughter Nowhere else happened inside the park
 raaj ye ki gitanjali ke ghar waalon ne ek nayaa khulaasa kiya he
 It was revealed that CJM saheb also had a relationship with another woman and another secret was that someone was blackmailing Gitanjali for the old relationship and also said that on Wednesday, Gitanjali went to meet him in the park
 With a pistol
 magar donon main jhagada hua or pistal gitanjali se lekar usne gitanjali par hi goli chalaa di haalanki gitanjali ke puraane rishton yaa use blackmel kiye jane ke sawaal par gudgaanv police philhal khamosh he
 Now along with the police, the silence of the case will be broken when the questions of what, why, how and who will be answered
 puraane rishton ko lekar gitanjali ko blackmel kiye jane ke mudde par bhale hi police khamosh ho magar jaj sahab ke nae rishte ko lekar gitanjali ke ghar vaale khuleam bol rahe hai
 The people of Gitanjali's house have an allegation that there is another woman in the life of the judge and it is quite possible that Gitanjali was removed from the way
 to kya gitanjali ke pati yani gudgaanv ke sijeem ravanit garg ke nazaij tallukaat unki bivi ke katl kii vajah ban gai? police kii tafteesh chaahe jis ore bhi bad rahi ho, gitanjali ke gharavaalon ko apane damaad ke avaidh sambandhon kii vajah se gitanjali kaa katl kiye jane kaa bhi shaq he
 Well, this is not the first time, when any theory of this blind murder has come out, but the reality is that in the last five days the police have not been able to find any clue about Gitanjali's killer, five different theories about his death Has arrived
 aapako yaad hoga ki sabase pehle gitanjali kii laash milte hi, unke pati ravanit garg ne apni patni ke khudakushi kaa shaq jataayaa tha lekin jaise hi gitanjali ke gharavaalon ko apni beti ke maut kii khabar mili, gharavaalon ne pehla iljaam ravanit par hi lagaaya unka poocha ki aakhir bagaiyr kisi jaanch ke ravanit kudakushi ke nattejey par kaise pahunch gaye? darasal, ravanid or uske gharavaalon ne hi gitanjali ko betaa na janmane kii vajah se maar daalaa or ab maamle ko khudakushi bataa kar bachane kii koshish kar rahe hai is baat kaa zikr unhone police ko di gai apni pehali taharir main bhi kiya tha
 But after this, the family members revealed that they had not only given lakhs of rupees in carts and cash dowry to the in-laws of Gitanjali till the time of marriage, but from time to time such things were demanded from the in-laws
 lekin abhi in aaropon ke darmyaan jaise hi police ne gitanjali ke pati ravanit garg se poochtacha shuru kii, unke bayanon se maamle main ek or nayaa mode aa gaya
 Garg said that Gitanjali was often angry with one of his servants and driver and that both of them may have conspired to get Gitanjali out of the way, now it became necessary for the police to interrogate the servant and the driver, but like this The final theory of the case was not thereafter, the reason given by the family members of Gitanjali for the murder of their daughter is the most strange and shocking for all the reasons
 gitanjali ke bhai kii maane to bahut mumkin he ki uske pati ne apane avaidh sambandhon ke chalate hi gitanjali kii jaan le lee
 Now after this charge, the family members of Gitanjali were obliged to ask the reason behind it
so, as soon as they were asked this question, they replied 'yes, my sister had told about the illegal relationship, then we gave this complaint is
 'ab jaahir he, is maamle main police ek theory kii tah tak pahunch nahin paati he, tab tak ek nai theory saamne aa jaati he or aise asli kaatil ke chehre se pardaa kab tak hatega, philhal iskaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he
 On the other hand, five days after the murder of the Gurgaon police is still burying the head in the bushes and see that the bush which she had been brushing for the last four days, even took the bushes up to the name of the investigation to raid the same bush
 On the fifth day he gets two bullets
 ye goliyaan usee jagah se milin jahaan se gitanjali kii laash mili thisijeem ravanit garg kii patni gitanjali ke katl ke maamle main gudgaanv police kii special investigeshan team yani esaiti pichley paanch dinon se yun hi lagaataar police line park kii khaak chaan rahi thi
 Because the police felt that if the murderer killed Gitanjali at this place, then surely the bullets fired on him would also be found because the three bullets that Gitanjali had hit, all of them pierced his body
 - The cross went out and finally on Monday, the police's effort came to light when, while filtering mud in the park, he got two bullets one by one, these bullets are the part of the cartridge which is usually In such a situation, the police suspect that these bullets are among those three bullets fired by Gitanjali, which came out of her body
 ab police in goliyon kii forensik jaanch karvaa rahi he, taaki ye baat saaf ho sake ki ye goliyaan sijeem garg ke usee revolver se chalaai gai yaa nahin, jo mauka-e-vaardaat par padi hui mili thi
 It is also important for the police to know, because the way Gitanjali's body was found lying in an open space in the middle of a park, there was no denying that the murderer had taken Gitanjali's life elsewhere
 The corpse would then be thrown into the park and thrown away
 ab agar forensik jaanch main ye baat saaf ho jaati he ki ye goliyaan ravanit garg kii revolver se chalaai gai chah goliyon main se hi hai, to kam se kam ek baat to saaf ho jaaegi ki gitanjali kaa katl park main usee jagah par kiya gaya, jahaan par uski laash padi hui mil
 After this, the police can look for fresh eyewitnesses of this incident in the surrounding areas, as well as the movement of a particular mobile number at the time of the crime in that area, so that any clue of the murderer can be found in his hands
 It seems, however, that in the investigation so far, it has become clear that during the incident, Geetanjali did not go for a walk with her mobile phone, but before leaving the house did Geetanjali have any Did you talk on the phone with him? In order to reach the murderer, it is also necessary for the police to know the answer to this question and this is the reason why the police are also investigating the call details of Gitanjali's CDR
 aise main agar gitanjali ke sidiaar main darj kisi khaas mobile number kii movement vaardaat ke vakt park ke aas-paas pai jaati he, to phir ye police ke liye ek ahm jaankaree sabit ho sakati he

 aajkal media ko lekar bhi log sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 There is corruption inside the media
 patrkaar bhi kisi na kisi party ke pravaktaa ke rup main baat karne lage hai
 i do not say that all the people in our society are bad
 kai naagarik acha kaam bhi karte hai
 Many leaders are also working in the interest of society
 kai patrkaar bhi patrakarita kaa maan rakhte hue is jeevika ko bachaae rakhen hai
 But the question arises why this appearance? We could not change our thinking but keep burning effigy of Ravana, thinking that good will triumph over evil
 agar ravan kaa putala jalaane se yah ho jaataa to aaj desh kaa naagarik itnaa asurakshit na hota
 The country would have been progressing ravan ke andar kai achche gun bhi the
 Ravana was a good ruler who took care of his subjects
 lekin aisa hamaare samaaj main nahin dikhaai de rahaa he
 Many politicians will burn the effigy of Ravana by becoming Ram, and will eat the bread of politics in the name of Ravana
 agar sach main hamaare rajaneta ram hote to aaj hamaare desh main raamarajy hota
 We are not in the mire of corruption, do not ask for votes in the name of caste and religion, do not weigh Hindu and Muslim in two scales
 tippaniyan We consider ourselves citizens of the largest democratic country, do we really practice the religion of a civilized and alert citizen
 jab chunaav hota he to ham aise ummidavaar ko chunate hai jo netaa banane ke laayak nahin, jo vikaas ko nazarandaaj kar dete hai
 We see who has stood out from our religion and caste, choosing him and sending him forward
 phir jab vah kaam nahin karata to rote rahete hai
 If someone is killed in our neighborhood, we keep watching
 agar koi musiibat main he to uski madad nahin karte hai
 But when it comes to the Protest, they stand with a stick
 ham media vaale bhi koi doodh ke dhule nahin hai
 Nowadays people are also raising questions about the media
 media ke andar bhi karpshan he
 Journalists have also started talking as spokespersons of some party
 main yah nahin kahata ki hamaare samaaj ke sabhi log kharaab hai
 Many citizens also do good work
 kai netaa bhi samaaj ke hit main kaam kar rahe hai
 Many journalists also preserve this livelihood while keeping the value of journalism
 lekin sawaal yah uthta he yah dikhaawat kyon ? ham apane soch ko badal nahin paae lekin ravan ke putale ko jalaate rahete hai, yah sochakar ki buraai ke upar achchhai kii jeet hogi
 If this was done by burning effigy of Ravana, then the citizen of the country would not be so insecure
 desh tarki kar rahaa hota

 Now the big question is why the laborers did not have safety equipment in them while getting into the poisonous sewer? When the three laborers came down to clean the sewer at 5:00 am, why was there such a delay in the arrival of the crane? Why are the sanitary workers descending into the sewer not wearing masks on behalf of the administration? If the workers of the sanitation workers agreed, when two laborers descended into the sewer to save their partner and they did not come back for a long time, the crane took a long time to come

 bharat ke anbhavi salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir par shanivaar ko pratham shrenee cricket main chaar maichon kaa pratibandh laga diya gaya
 The reason for this ban imposed on him is due to a dispute with Delhi team coach Bhaskar Pillai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy this year
 faisle ke baad salaami ballebaaj ne kaha ki vah is faisle iskaa paalan karenge
 The inquiry committee constituted by Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) administrator Justice Vikramjit Sen included chairman Madan Lal, Rajendra r Rathore and advocate Soni Singh, who found Gambhir guilty and termed the behavior of the batsman as serious and unfair
 haalanki sen ne faisla kiya ki agar gambhir is aadesh ko sweekaar kar lete hai or is tarah kii koi galati nahin karte hai to un par 30 march 2019 tak samaapt hone tak do saal tak yah sajaa nilambit rahegi
 "the incident took place when the DDCA team was in Odisha and there was a confrontation between Gautam Gambhir and Bhaskar Pillai and a complaint was lodged by the coach," Sen said in a statement
 iske baad maine 10 march 2017 ko donon vyaktiyon se mulaakaat kii
 The matter could not be dealt with amicably and satisfactorily
 'unhone kaha ki samiti ke sadsy is baat se sahamat the ki gambhir kaa bartaav pillai ke khilaaf anuchit tha jo kaaphi gambhir baat he isaliye sifarish kii gai ki is bartaav kii sajaa jaruri he, lekin yah is tareeke se kiya jaye ki iskaa doharaav nahin ho or team ke sabhi sadasyon dwaara is mudde ko gambhirtha se liya jaye
 In his response, Gambhir said that he would follow the verdict
 unhone kaha, maine nyaayamurti sen kaa aadesh dekha he or iskaa paalan karuunga
 This means that if Gambhir does not behave like this in the next two years, then he will not be banned for a single match

 ab aise sanket bhi mili hai ki pradhanmantri narendra modi tamaam antarrashtriya netaaon se hindi main hi baat kar sakate hai
 Apparently, he will seek the help of an interpreter for this
 angreji akhbaar 'da indian express' ne aisi khabar di he
 The newspaper has written that if many of the diplomats of New Delhi are to be believed, the language never came in the way of their interaction with Modi
 akhbaar ke sutara bataate hai ki iske baavjood modi ne videshi mehmaanon se bhi hindi main hi baat karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Modi also spoke to Rajapaksa in Hindi, though he is so comfortable in English that he does not need an interpreter to translate English into Hindi
 haal hi main modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh ke liye srilankai raashtrapati mahindra rajpakshe dilli aae the
 During his meeting with Modi, he was speaking in English, but the Prime Minister did not need an interpreter even once to understand him
 modi ne apane jawaab hindi main hi die, jise dubhashie ne rajpakshe ko samajhaayaa
 He adopted the same protocol for the Special Envoy of the Sultan of Oman
 lekin jo log hindi yaa hindi mishrit urdu bol rahe the unke liye pradhanmantri ko dubhashie kii jarurat nahin padi
 These include Afghan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Afghan President Hamid Karzai
 karaji kuch samay bharat main padhe hai isliye vah thodi bahut urdu or hindi jaanate hai
 Vajpayee did not have English
 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee also spoke in Hindi as far as possible in bilateral talks
 par jahaan jarurat hoti thi, vah angreji bolne se bhi gurej nahin karte the
 The help of the interpreter was taken only when Vajpayee had difficulty in understanding the tone of the foreign guest
 haalanki abhi yah saaf nahin he ki videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj vaajapeyi kaa tarika apanaaengi yaa nahin
 So far all their meetings have been held in English
 china ke videsh mantri ravivaar ko bharat aa rahe hai
 Former Prime Minister Chandrasekhar used to give speeches in Hindi but used English in bilateral talks
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki agar modi har dwipaksheeya vaarta main hindi kaa istemaal karne kaa faisla karte hai to vah aisa karne vaale pehle pradhanmantri honge
 Last year 'bahubali' left a question unfinished

 The film's climax scene is underway in Hyderabad

 If the news is to be believed then it is expected that the first look of the film will be seen on October 23
 23 oktober ko prabhas kaa janmdin he is maukey par first luk relies kiya ja saktaa he
 Since the first part of Sebahubali released in July 2015, there is a lot of excitement about this film
 is movie ne box offis par bhi kai filmon ke records tode the
 Art director Sabu Cyril has created a new empire for 'bahubali 2'
 'bahubali 2'ke liye ban rahe nae samrajya kii kuch tasviren bhi haal hi main saamne ai thim
 Around 300 to 500 workers were employed to make a new set of Bahubali-2
 sabase khaas baat ye he ki film ke sabase dilachasp seen kii bhi shooting ho chuki he jisamen bataaya gaya he ki aakhir katappa ne bahubali ko kyon maaraa
 Let us know that the film will be released on 28 April next year
 huaave kii sahaayak company honor ne haal hi main bhartiya market main Honor 10 Lite launch kiya he
 However, it was launched in China only last year
 bharat main is smartphone ke do verients launch hue hai
 The price of 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage variant is Rs 13,999
 duusare verient main 6GB ram 64GB internal memory he
 It costs Rs 17,999
 yani 4GB verient se 4,000 rupee zyada
 The difference of Rs 4,000 is huge for those buying mid range smartphones in India
 aapke paas 17,999 rupee main kai opshan maujuud hai jisaki memory zyada he or spacifications bhi behatar hai
 The price of 4GB RAM variants is fine and at this price its specifications are also better
 is keemat par customers POCO F1 kharid sakate hai
 POCO F1 has Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, while in Honor 10 Lite you get Kirin 710
 gikabench tests ke mutabik qolkom snapadragon 710 huaave ke Kirin 710 chipset se behatar overol parformens detaa he
 Obviously the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 is faster than both of these and it is still new
 haalanki market main Snapdragon 855 bhi aa gaya he, lekin ye hai and smartfones main diya ja rahaa he or aise phone chand hi hai
 Talking about the battery, this is a big issue for midrange users
 Honor 10 Lite ke 6GB verient main bhi aapako 3,400mah kii bydaree milegi, jabaki Xiaomi ke POCO F1 main 4,000mah kii bydaree di gai he
 Honor 10 Lite also lacks fast charging, while POCO F1 Quick Charge 3
 0 saport karata he yani fast charge hoga
 USB Type c is not available in Honor 10 Lite, while POCO F1 has USB Type c support
 aap yuasabi tip si ke phaayde achche se jaanate honge
 In this era, USB Type c is not available in this budget smartphone
 agar gaming ke liye smartphone khareednaa he, photography ke liye yaa phir filmein dekhne ke liye parformens jaruri he
 The Snapdragon 845 is a plus point
 isliye aap agar Honor 10 Lite lene kaa man bana rahe hai, to iske badale POCO F1 kharid sakate hai
 If the 6GB RAM variant of Honor 10 Lite was also priced at Rs 15,999, the deal would have been better, but the company has kept it at Rs 4,000 more expensive than the base model
 ek tathy ye bhi he ki companiyaan aaj kal samay se pehle apane smartphone kii keemten bhi kam karti hai
 So it will be interesting to see more smartphones that are up to 20 thousand segments, their price is low or not
 agar aisa hua to Honor 10 Lite ke 6GB ram verient ke market main muqabla or bhi kadaa hoga
 Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming believes that Mahendra Singh Dhoni is capable of remaining captain for the next three years
 lekin newjiland ke is purv cricketer ko nahin pataa ki kya vah itane lambey samay tak khel ke teenon formet main khelnaa jari rakhenge
 Fleming said, 'I have not spoken to him on this issue
 vah acchhee lay main he or feet he, vah teen se chaar saal tak captaini jari rakh saktaa he
 But i do not know how long he will play in all three formats
 yah kaaphi mushkil he kyonki bharat kaa kaarykram kaaphi vyast he
 Fleming has been the coach of the Chennai Super Kings for six seasons and his relationship with Dhoni is quite cordial
 unhone kaha, 'main chahta hum ki dhoni ipel ko enjoy karen yani do maheene tak iskaa lutf uthaaen, wo bhartiya team se brake lekar chennai team main aaye hai
 He likes the game and looks quite comfortable winning consecutive matches for Chennai
 ' The Supreme Court, giving a historic verdict in the Ayodhya case, ordered the disputed structure to be handed over to the Hindus, and asked the central government to set up a trust for the temple within three months
 supreme court ne yah aadesh bhi diya he ki masjid ke liye centre yaa rajya sarkaar ayodhya main hi suuteble or prominent jagah zamin de
 The court also said that it was illegal to demolish the Babri Masjid in 1992 and keep the idol in 1949
 supreme court dwaara ramalala virajman ko malikana haq diya gaya
 The Supreme Court held that the deity is a legal person
 supreme court (paanchon jajon kii sahmati se faisla) ne kaha- 2
 77 acres of land in favor of Hindus
 centre sarkaar teen maheene ke bheetar madir ke liye trust banaaegi, trust main nirmohi akhaada kaa pratinidhi bhi rahegaa
 CJI Ranjan Gogoi said, "the receiver will currently occupy the occupied space
" sunni vakf board ko paanch acre zamin milegi
 The court has initially rejected the petitions of the Shia Waqf Board and the Nirmohi Akhara
 yah faisla sabhi jajon kii sahmati se hua he
 Supreme Court Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that the Archaeological Department has presented evidence of the temple being built
 saikadon pannon kaa jajment padhate hue peeth ne kaha ki hindu ayodhya ko ram janmasthal maanate hai or ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki court ke liye thiology (dharamshastra) main janaa uchit nahin he
 But the archeology department could not even tell that the mosque was built after the temple was demolished
 supreme court ke faisle main kaha gaya ki 1856-57 se pehle hinduon ko aantarik ahaate main jane se koi roak nahin thi
 Muslims did not have the right to outside enclosure
 sunni vakf board ekal adhikaar kaa saboot nahin de paaya

 She came to India from Pakistan with high hopes
 use bharosa tha ki hindu hone ke naate pakistan ke skool main uske saath jo bhedbhaav hota tha wo bharat main nahin hoga
 Also, she will be able to fulfill her dream of becoming a police officer by getting a good education in India
 lekin bharat main uske liye skool main daakhile ke liye hi laale pade hue hai
 It is being talked about 16-year-old girl Madhu, who came to Delhi from Sindh, Pakistan
 'aaj tak' ko is bitiyaa kii vyathaa kaa pataa chalaa to har us daravaaje tak jane kii koshish kii jahaan se uski mushkil aasaan hone kii ummid thi
 Madhu came to Delhi with relatives Madhu left Pakistan two years ago, so she used to study there in the 9th
 madhu apni maa, bhai, chachaa or do rishtedaaron ke saath dilli ai
 Madhu's father passed away a few years ago
 madhu kii maa kuch maheene bharat main rahane ke baad majaburiyon kii vajah sepakistanlout gai
 Since then, Madhu is living in Sanjay Nagar Colony, Bhati Mines area of delhi, along with her brother and a distant uncle
 madhu vahiin sarkari skool main 9veen main daakhila lenaa chaahati he
 Right now she is studying at home due to lack of admission in school
 dilli main padhanaa chaahati hai madhu'aaj tak' se baat karte hue kaha madhu ne kaha ki mujhe padhane kaa bahut man he, maine bhaati mins ke skool main admician karwaane kai baar gai to mujhase pruf maanga gaya, main aadhaar card or affidavit le kar gai
 But everyone else got the coedmission and i did not get it, then i wrote a letter to the Chief Minister of Delhi
 lekin 10 din ho gaya abtak kuch jawaab nahin aayaa, ab maine sochaa he ki bharat ke shiksha mantri ko bhi chitthee deni jaaoongi, taaki mujhe admician de de taaki main padhai kar sakuun or main apni family ko help kar sakuun,admician ke dar-dar bhatak rahi he madhupakistan main maine bahut padhai kii lekin vahaan par padhai kii koi vailu nahin he isliye main yahaan par ai hum
 There is a lot of excess there but i cannot tell much, because my mother and brother are still there, there is no help here, so i am requesting the Government of India to give me admission, so that i can study and move forward and serve the country and the family
 maine principal sar se 10-12 baar mili, unhone kaha betaa aap pahaleindian pruflao phir aao, pehle hamaara pruf nahin banataa tha, lekin baad main jaise-taise aadhaar card or affidavit banwaaya or skool gai
 But later those people refused admission
 hindustani pruf nahin hone se pareshanimadhu or uske chachaa jawahar kaa kahana he ki mere kai baar koshish karne ke baad bhi skool main daakhila nahin mil rahaa
 Sometimes Madhu is not being admitted by pleading for a transfer certificate and sometimes due to an overdose
 madhu kaa kahana he ki certificate pakistan se kaise laae
 More children have been admitted in this school, but not only this child is being admitted, we have been asked for a lot of papers, we have given many papers in it, but now we are saying that the time is over, we Poor, cannot teach in private school
 madhu kaa bhai bhi chahta he ki uski bahan aage padhe or apane pairon par khadey ho
 He said, 'we toured the school for my sister's admission, but she is not getting admission, she wants to study, i request my government to get my sister's admission and go ahead with studies
 skool ne maanga bhartiya dastavejais maamle par 'aaj tak' us skool main gaya jahaan madhu admician lenaa chaahati he, lekin vaais principal sahab nahin mili, phir team ne unke phone par sampark saadhaa
 State Co-ed Higher Secondary School, Bhati Mines, while talking, said, 'there is no problem in taking admission under the rules that we have, but we will have to follow the rules, in such a case, if we have to take admission in class VIII
 You can take admission by giving all the information you need in an Aadhar card and an affidavit, but if you want to take admission in 9th class or Dashami class, then you have to get Aadhaar card, affidavit Apart from the transfer certificate will have to be given, under the rule, i was asked that Madhu, a Pakistani student, is saying that you had earlier said that the Aadhar card and affidavit will be admitted
 is par principal sahab ne kaha, 'meraa kya kahana he or madhu kaa kya kahana he vah alag baat he, niyam kya kahata he vah hi hoga
 Due to lack of admission, family members are upset that the government has sanctioned electricity and water connection in the house where Madhu is staying with uncle in Delhi
 yahaan tak ki ghar ke sadasyon ke aadhaar card bhi bane hue hai
 But the biggest question about a daughter's education is she is deprived of it
 vahiin skool ke principal kaa kahana he ki niyamon kii vajah se unke haath bandhe hue hai

 com / tq1vwyrzjc— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)may 5, 2018 # 1
 What did Mangaluru say? The result of the Modi Kurnataka assembly elections clearly shows on the walls that the BJP will form the government with an absolute majority in the state
 congress par hamalaa bolte hue unhone kaha ki congress lagaataar jhooth failaa rahi he, lekin ab log ab jaagruk ho gaye hai
 Congress is getting wiped out from state after state
 ab congress ko koi bhi vot nahin dena chahta he
 Taking a dig at the Congress, he said, "if i do the Red Fort with the talk of cleanliness campaign, then these people make fun
 ''is dauraan modi ne raily main maujuud logon se sawaal kiya ki agar main safai kii baat karata hum, to kya yah sahi nahin hai
 He said that only one task of the Congress is to oppose it
 chaahe phir aarthik sudhaaron kaa maamla ho yaa phir kisi niti se judaa maamla

 shivamoga main kya bole modishivamoga main piem modi ne kaha, ''shivamoga ke saath meraa vishesh naata rahaa he
 i got into politics quite late
 saal 1991 main kanyakumari se kashmir tirangaa yatra lekar nikle the, to mujhako shivamoga ko sambodhit karne kaa pehali baar mauka mila tha
 This was the first time i had addressed such a large public meeting
 us din shivamoga ne mujhe jo pyaar diya tha, usko main kabhi bhul nahin saktaa hum
 At that time, the province of Karnataka had made saffron vessel to make this journey successful
 kaaphi sankhya main karnataka ke log jammu-kashmir pahunchakar is ekta abhiyaan ko safal banaaya tha
 In a befitting attack on the Congress, Modi said that the Congress was following in the footsteps of the British
 congress jati, dharm, sampradaay or kshetra ke aadhaar par baantkar shashan karnaa chaahati he
 He said that the Congress does not even want to give its account
 congress jhooth bol rahi he
 He told the people that if Congress came to ask for votes, then ask who are the patrons of sand mafias
 congress kaa c or karpshan ke c main ab koi antar hi nahin bachaa he

 gadag main kya bole modigadag kii raily main modi ne kaha- karnataka vidhansabha nateezon ke baad bijepi PPP main badal jaaegi
 Explaining the meaning of this, he said - Congress will become PPP Congress after the results
 yani punjab, pudducheri or parivaar congress
 PM Narendra Modi held a second rally in Gadag on Saturday
 gadag main modi ne kaha ki chunaav ke baad congress party ko pipipi congress party banane kaa kaam bhi karnataka ke log karenge
 That is, after the elections, the Congress will be reduced to Punjab, Puducherry and family
 gadag main piem modi bole ki karnataka main aisi sarkaar baithi he, jo soti hi rahati he
 We have realized the dream that the income of farmers will double by 2022 and everyone has a home
 raily main modi bole ki karnataka congress ke netaaon ke liye to keval ek hi mantra he ' baap bada na bhaiya sabase bada rupaiya' or mukhyamantri ji ne to kahawat hi badal di unka mantra he ' baap bhi bada, bhaiya bhi bada magar usase bhi bada rupaiya, siddha rupaiya'
 Taking a dig at the Congress, Modi said that the Congress has built a huge network of recovery mafias all over Karnataka
 agar yah congress sarkaar gai to dilli tak paise kaise jaaenge
 Congress leaders and ministers have formed a tank, from which the money of corruption goes directly from the pipeline to the big leaders of Congress sitting in Delhi
 yahi vajah he ki karnataka main haar ko saamne dekh congress pareshaan dikh rahi he
 Modi said that the Congress has put everything at stake in Karnataka, today the Congress is splashing to win the elections
 karnataka kii congress sarkaar ko yahaan ke jangalon main aisi jadi booti mil gai, jisase unhen lagata he isse puure desh main congress ko jinda rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Corruption is necessary for the Congress to survive

 What did Tumkur Mengodi say? On Saturday, PM Narendra Modi first addressed the rally in Tumkur

 The Congress has always tried to win the election by chanting this garland only
 congress ke leader jinhen haraa mirch-laal mirch nahin pataa, aalu se sone kii baat karte hai, ve bhi aaj kisaan kii baaten kar rahe hai
 Earlier, while opening the speech, Modi said that soon after becoming the Prime Minister, i had the privilege of worshiping this earth
 saath hi modi ne congress par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 The PM said that we are washing away the sins of the Congress
 congress ne aisi sarkaar chalaai ki aaj bijli ke liye yah kshetra taras rahaa he
 Our government has also launched a big campaign for the development of this region
 itane saal se congress shashan main thi, usne kyon kuch nahin kiya or is desh ke kisaan karj main dub gaye
 They have to commit suicide
 congress ne kisaan ke liye kuch kiya hota to meraa kisaan mitti main se sona paidaa karke de detaa
 PM Modi also cast a spell on the JDS
 modi ne kaha ki sabhi survey main jedies rajya main number teen par bhi nahin aa rahi he
 In such a situation, do not spoil the party with your vote, only BJP can defeat Congress
 jedies congress ko nahin haraa sakati, karnataka main agar koi sarkaar badal sakati he to vah he bijepi
 Modi said that there is a nexus between the Congress and the JDS behind the curtain, the leader of the Congress has become the Mayor by joining the JDS
 modi ne kaha ki ve purv piem echdi devgauda kaa sammaan bhi karte hai
 Modi further said that in 30-35 months, our government has spent more than 1 lakh crores to reach the farmers
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf maine ek ladaai chhedi hui he
 We started the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme with Aadhaar, we started depositing money directly into the bank accounts of the entitled people
 modi ne kaha ki kisaanon ke naam par raajnneeti karne vaali congress se main poochna chahta hum ki hemavathi nadi kaa pani hamaare tumkuru ke kisaanon ko kyon nahin mila
 We will connect the Hemwati and Netravati rivers to reach the farmers of Tumkur and the surrounding 8 districts

 The PM said that today he is going to address the people of Furkarnataka

 First, the Shiv Sena's emphasis will be towards the Urban Development Ministry, this time Pawar's NCP will give the sacrifice for the Shiv Sena
 This is going to be the first time in the history of Maharashtra when the Shiv Sena is going to get the Home Ministry of the state
 1999 se lekar 2014 tak maharashtra kaa grih mantralay lagaataar rashtravaadi congress party ke paas rahaa he
 But this time, bowing to the pressure of coalition religion, NCP has agreed to give this important ministry to Shiv Sena
 'home' par sharad-uddhav kii lambii mulakatsutron ke mutabik shuukravaar ko maharashtra ke mukhyamantriuddhav thakrene ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar se lambii baat kii
 This met in Worli
 is dauraan portpholio ke bantwaare par vistaar se charchaa hui
 In the meeting, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray strongly advocated for the Home Ministry for his party instead of the Urban Development Ministry
 sutara bataate hai ki siem pad par rahane ke baad mukhyamantri uddhav thakare ko grih mantralay kaa mahatv samaj main aa gaya he, ab ve har haalat main is mantralay ko apni party ke liye chaahate hai
 The meeting included Shiv Sena strategist Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena legislature party leader Eknath Shinde, senior party leader Subhash Desai, NCP leader Jayant Patil and NCP leader Ajit Pawar
 1999 se pavaar ke paas he grih mantralay kaa powerbata den ki maharashtra main ensipi lambey samay se grih mantralay ko apane cote main rakhe hue he
 The Chief Minister of Maharashtra changed five times between 1999 and 2014, but the responsibility of the Home Ministry remained with the NCP
 sharad pawaris baar ye powerful mantralay shivasena ke liye qurbaan karne ko taiyaar hai
 Sources reveal that earlier Shiv Sena's thrust was towards the Ministry of Urban Development
 party sarkaar gathan se hi is mantralay ko maang rahi thi, lekin ab shivasena ne man badal liya he
 Please tell that in 1995, when the Shiv Sena formed the first government in Maharashtra, the post of Home Ministry was still with the BJP
 2014 main jab shivasena ne bijepi ke saath sarkaar banaai to bhi is mantralay par bijepi ne apana daawa barkaraar rakhaa
 Former CM Devendra Fadnavis ensured that this ministry does not get out of his hands
 agar shivasena ko is baar grih mantralay milegaa to aisa pehali baar hoga jab bala sahib kii party maharashtra ke grih mantralay ko sanbhaalegi
 Became a minister, do not reconcile the ministry that it has been a week for the formation of government in Maharashtra, but the leaders who took oath with CM Uddhav Thackeray have not got the ministry yet
 is maamle par bijepi ne sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 Uddhav Thackeray was sworn in as CM on November 28
 unke saath congress, ensipi or shivasena ke 6 netaaon ne cabinet mantri pad kii shapath lee thi, lekin inhen abtak mantri pad nahin mil paaya he
 BJP leader Ashish Shelar said that there is deep dissatisfaction among the mlas of this alliance
 report ke mutabik is meeting main sharad pavaar ne kaha ki mantriyon ke bich jald se jald vibhaag kaa bantwaaraa kiya janaa chahie
 The expansion of the cabinet in Maharashtra is proposed after the winter session in Nagpur

 shridevi kii fain sabaa aarif ne 30 july ko fasebuk par ek post likhi thi, jisamen unhone bataaya ki jab unhone pichhali raat tivi par ifa aword seremani dekhi to unhen shridevi ko shradhanjali die jane ke dauraan apane video dikhe
 Their permission was not taken
 sabaa kaa kahana he ki unhone apane channel Kaleidoscopia par shridevi kaa video 25 march 2018 ko publish kiya tha
 Saba has also shared a link to the video made on Sridevi herself
 donon video kii tulana karen to sirf sabaa ke video kaa becoground mujeec badla gaya he
 Saba is saddened that his video was used, without even asking him and giving him credit
 dhadak ke baad jahnavi-ishan ke paas nahin he kaam? jaane kya he sachin aaropon ke jawaab main boni kapur ne kaha he, "video kii lagbhag sabhi clips mere yaa yashraj films ke hai, jo hamen adhikaar dete hai ki ham inkaa jaisaa chaahe vaisaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 The video was approved for IIFA after discussion with Yash Raj
 main jaananaa chahta hum kaise sabaa aarif inhen apana bataa rahi hai
 If they have any problem with the video, they should meet me instead of making allegations
 boni kii safai par sabaa ne bhi apni pratikriya di
 He said, "of course the videos are your own, but i put my heart and life in this video, it took three days to make it like this
 unhone clips yaa gane kaa sikvence change nahin kiya
 All this i did not ask for my clips to be used, but was about my hard work and use without my knowledge
 ye abhi bhi mere video hai or meri post par aisa riection dekhakar main hairaan hum
 "what was the theft of Sridevi's Tribute Video in IIFA? Fan accuses that people are targeting IIFA organizers on internet after allegations of Sabah
 yahaan tak ki kai celebs bhi sabaa aarif ke aaropon par riect kar rahe hai
 Sophie Chaudhary wrote on Twitter- "if it is true then it is very terrible
" ummid he ki tumhen credit mili
 '' aam chunaav main narendra modi ne jahaan desh ke chunavi paridrishy ko bijepi banaam anya kii ladaai main badal diya he, vahiin bihar main hone vaale up-chunaav is baat kii pehali pariksha honge ki bijepi se bhi bada ho chukaa pradhanmantri kaa yah aabhamandal ab bhi party ko jeet dilaa saktaa he yaa nahin
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the 'modi wave' had shown ground to the BJP opponents in the Hindi belt of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar — the opponents of the two states won only 16 seats out of a total of 120
 vaise to uttar pradesh main bhi 12 vidhansabha siton par up-chunaav hone hai, lekin bihar kii 10 siton par jaldi chunaav karaane ke liye adhisuchana jari ho chuki he
 Many seats were vacated before the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar due to the change of mlas
 uttar pradesh main up-chunaav is saal ke ant main maharashtra or haryana vidhansabha chunaavon ke saath ho sakate hai
 The Election Commission has fixed August 21 for the by-election on 10 assembly seats spread across 10 parliamentary constituencies of Bihar
 bihar bijepi kii rajya kaaryakarini samiti kii 19-20 july ko patna main baithak hui, jisamen na sirf taatkaalik chunautiyon balki agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ko dekhte hue nae sire se ekajute hone kii baat kii gai
 However, no announcement was made after this, but it is said that in this meeting, Union Minister Radha Mohan Singh, in a way, declared Sushil Modi as the chief ministerial candidate, while it is yet to be approved by the central leadership
 bijepi jab 16 may ke baad kii pehali chunauti se nipatane kii taiyaari main lagi he, bihar ke up-chunaav ‘dusron’—rashtriya janata dal (argedy) or janata dal united (jediu)—ke liye bhi utane hi mahatvapurn hai
 Despite the dominating caste politics in the state, the BJP had a surprising success in the general elections
 rajya kii kul 40 siton main se bijepi ko 22 siten or uske gathbandhan saathiyon lok janashakti party (algepi) tathaa rashtriya lok samta party (araspi) ko kul 9 siten mili thim
 In this way, the coalition won a total of 31 seats
 duusari ore, rajya main sattarudh nitish kii party jedy (you) or lalu prasad kii party argedy ko kramshah do or chaar siten hi hasil huin
 Now, in an effort to prevent any further political change in the state, the two previous opponents, Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav, are preparing to join hands
 rajya main argedy ke kaarykaal main lalu ke kathith ‘jangal raaj’ kaa virodh kar sheersh par jagah banane vaale nitish ke liye apane is lambey samay ke pratidwandvi ke saath haath milaane kii 16 may se pehle kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati thi
 This new alliance of his is a desperate move to unify the power of his identity politics, much like he intended to keep the BJP out of power during the peak phase of 'kamandal Rajneet' in the 1993 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 Extreme opponents Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati joined hands
 bihar main jin 10 vidhansabha siton par up-chunaav hone ja rahe hai, unamem bijepi-jedy (you) gathbandhan ne 2010 main saat siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 But looking at the votes cast on these seats during the Lok Sabha elections, the new NDA (BJP-LJP-RLSP) was leading in 8 of these 10 assembly seats
 inase sambandhit 10 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi netritv vaale gathbandhan ko 8 siton par jeet mili thi
 If the JD (U) alliance and the RJD alliance candidates are to get the votes shared in the Lok Sabha elections, then it seems that they can win four out of 10 assembly seats
 gathbandhan kii chunaav purv ghoshnaa se is sankhya ko badhaane main madad milti he yaa nahin yah to up-chunaav ke baad hi pataa chalegaa
 The RJD and JD (U) leaders are keen on a pre-poll alliance
 argedy ke upaadhyaksh or loksabhaa chunaav main vaishali seat par algepi ke ram kishor singh se haarane vaale purv kendriya mantri raghuvansh prasad singh kehete hai, “agar jedy (you) gathbandhan karne ke liye aage badhati he, to ham is par vichaar karenge
 We want the secular forces of the country to unite secular votes again
 ” yah maanate hue ki mandal kii raajnneeti ab apane antim daur main he, ve is baat par jor dete hai ki is gathbandhan kaa lakshya ‘vikaas’ hona chahie
 Says Singh, “the coalition partners should develop a minimum common program for the development of Bihar
 ” lalu ke is vishwast ne bataaya ki argedy ke mukhiya gathbandhan ke vichaar ke prati itane aakarshith isliye hue kyonki unke kareebi log bas isi baat kii charchaa kar rahe the ki loksabhaa chunaav main argedy or jedy (you) ko kul milakar 45 fisadi se zyada vot mili hai
 On the other hand, only 39 per cent of the new NDA (29 of BJP)
 4 fisadi, algepi ke 6
 4 percent and 3 percent of RLSP) votes
 bijepi ko is ganit kaa koi dar nahin he
 BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain says, "nitish-lalu's alliance will seal the bjp's strength in the state
 nitish sochate hai ki jin logon ne unhen vot diya he ve lalu ke saath khadey hone par bhi unhen vot denge
 This will not happen
 argedy-jedy (you) gathbandhan main ‘nitish raaj’ nahin hoga, yah lalu ke ishaare par chalegaa
 Only BJP can stop Lalu's direct or indirect influence
 ”argedy or jedy (you) ke netaa kehete hai ki gathbandhan ke bare main baatcheet ‘sakaaratmak’ disha main aage bad rahi he, lekin kai aise masale hai jinka samaadhaan kiya janaa he
 The biggest question is, who will be the leader of the alliance - Nitish or Lalu? It can also be a problem to decide the seat sharing formula
 chaara ghotaale main doshi sabit hone kii vajah se lalu chunaav nahin lard sakate hai
 His wife and former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi believes that Lalu will dominate any anti-bjp alliance
 jedy (you) 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke liye nitish ko pehle hi mukhyamantri ummidavaar bataa chuki he
 Given the pathetic performance of the JD (U) in the general election — the bail of 26 of its candidates was forfeited — Lalu will surely negotiate heavily
 jedy (you) netaaon kaa kahana he ki 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main to argedy kaa lagbhag khaatmaa hi ho gaya tha
 It did not win even 10 per cent of the seats required for the post of Leader of the Opposition
 do kshatrapon ke bich aguwai kii yah ladaai hi tay karegi ki ek saal baad hone vaali bihar kii jang kaa danka bajane ke baad ve ubhartee bijepi ke khilaaf ekajute hokar haar-jeet kaa varan karenge yaa alag-alag

 neshnal herald maamle ko lekar vipakshi dal congress ne buudhvaar ko baar-baar sansad kii kaarywahi ko baadhit kiya
 In fact, a Delhi court has ordered top party leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi to appear in the court in this case
 is bich, congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne is maamle par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki yah pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo) kii ore se puri tarah raajnneetik badale kii karrwai he
 There was a heated debate between the ruling party and members of Congress in the Lok Sabha, when Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that Sonia and Rahul were being deliberately targeted
 unhone neshnal herald maamle ko uthaate hue kaha, "yah saare vipaksh ke saath kiya ja rahaa he

 " iske alaava sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu ne bhi sonia ko phone kar unke janm kii 69veen varshganth par unhen shubhakamanaayen deen
 Significantly, the government which wishes Sonia Gandhi on her birthday, on the other hand, is trying hard today to show that he (the government) has nothing to do with the matter related to the National Herald, in which Sonia and her son Rahul Gandhi has been ordered to appear in court as he is accused of illegally taking possession of assets worth Rs 5,000 crore belonging to the newspaper

 According to the Prime Minister, the matter regarding the Mumbai attack and the destruction of the terrorist structure flourishing in Pakistan's land was also put in front of Geelani, on which the Pakistani Prime Minister also assured of concrete action
 pradhanmantri ke mutabik saajha bayaan main unhone ye bhi kaha ki aatankwaad ko donon mulkon ke bich baatcheet kii prakriya se joda nahin janaa chahie, haalanki unhone ye bhi kaha ki aage kii baatcheet pakistan ke ravaiye se hi tay hogi
 BJP did not walk out of the House
 The Prime Minister was not sitting on the statement that BJP leader Sushma Swaraj questioned the question of being soft and dealing with Pakistan
 sushamaa swaraj kii baat ansuni hone lagi to vipaksh ke netaa laalkrishna adwani sadan main khadey hue
 He not only objected to the softness in India's stand against Pakistan after the Mumbai attacks but also walked out of the House with his mps
 isse pehle rajyasabha main bijepi ke mahasachiv or saansad arun jetali ne aatankwaad or pakistan se baatcheet par bharat ke rukh ko lekar sawaal uthaaya
 Jaitley said what was the reason that led to India taking a U-turn and the need to look at dialogue and terrorism with Pakistan differently
 purv kendriya rigerv bank (arabiai) governor raghuram rajan ne kaha he ki kendra sarkaar ke liye rigerv bank governor koi naukarshah nahin he or use naukarshah samajhnaa sarkaar kii bhul he
 Raghuram Rajan has said this through his new book 'I Do What i Do' that the Central Government needs to improve its stand on the post of Reserve Bank Governor
 rajan ke mutabik, rigerv bank governor ke adhikaron kii spasht paribhaasha nahin hone kaa sabase bada khatra yahi he ki beuroperesi lagaataar uski shaktiyon ko kam karne kii koshish main rahati he
 However, Rajan said that the governments before the current government have been doing so with regard to the powers of the governor, which has weakened the role of the central bank in the economy
 gauratlab he ki raghuram rajan kii nai kitaab unke bhaashanon or lekhon kaa sankalan maatr he
 This book is not a complete account of his tenure like the book of former Central Bank Governor Duvuru Subbarao
 na hi rajan kii is kitaab main purv governor yag venugopal reddy kii tarah kaarykaal ke dauraan liye gaye faislon main parde ke peeche ke khel kaa khulaasa kiya gaya he
 Reddy was the Governor of the Central Bank from 2003 to 2008
 ise bhi padhein: kya china kii salaah maanakar BRICS summit main PAK par 'chuppi' saadhe rahenge modi?haalanki apni kitaab ke prastaavna or kuch lekhon ke parichay ke jariye raghuram rajan ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan liye gaye kuch ahm faislon par apana mat dete hue samajhane kii koshish kii he
 Independent RBI needed for economic stability On the last day of his tenure at the Reserve Bank, Rajan said, 'india needs a strong and independent Reserve Bank for macroeconomic stability, which is of paramount importance
 ’ rajan ne kaha, ‘aise parivesh main jahaan kendriya bank ko samay-samay par kendra or rajya sarkaron ke sheersh str ke khilaaf majbootee se date rahanaa padataa he, main apane purvavarti governor da
 i remember the words of Subbarao
 jab unhone kaha tha ki vitt mantri ek din yah kahenge ki main rigerv bank se aksar pareshaan hota hum, itnaa pareshaan ki main baahar saiyr par janaa chahta hum, chaahe mujhe akele hi janaa pade
 But thank God that the Reserve Bank is here
 ’ rajdhani dilli ke saint steffens college main ek sabha ko sambodhit karte hue rajan ne kaha, ‘central bank kaa kaam utana aasaan nahin, jitna dikhataa tha or nishchit rup se yah byaaj daron ko ghataane-badhaane bhar kaa to bilkul hi nahin tha
 Rajan further said that independence of banks is important for the RBI to make decisions regarding its functioning
 rajan ne vyapak aarthik sthirataa ke liye kendriya bank ke parichaalan main swatantraaa kii baat kii
 He also said that 'the Reserve Bank always has to work in consultation with the Finance Ministry under a framework set by the government and it cannot be relieved of all obligations
 ’ise bhi padhein: korian bam se ‘ludhaka’ japan ke nikkei samet sensex or niftinebhi ke laabh se nahin banegaa bajatarajan ne yah bhi kaha tha ki rigerv bank dwaara apane laabh main se sarkaar ko vishesh labhaansh dene se bajet kii samasya dur karne main madad nahin milegi
 Rajan said, 'it happens that all the time many government agencies insist on monitoring the activities of the Reserve Bank
 kai staron par jaanch-padtaal hoti he or vishesh taur par aisi agenciyaan yah karti hai, jinhen takneekee maamalon kii samaj nahin hoti he, isse keval nirnay prakriya ko hi nuksaan hota he
 Instead, the government-appointed Reserve Bank Board, which consists of former officials, government officials and people appointed by the government, should play the role of monitoring
 ’spasht ko bank kii shaktiyanrajan ne kaha tha ki bharat ke liye vrihad aarthik sthayitv kaaphi mahatvapurn he or is maamle main jab bhi sthiti kii jarurat ho, to kendriya bank ke paas sansaadhan, gyaan or peshewar log hone chahie
 He said that India needs a strong and independent Reserve Bank for macroeconomic stability
 rajan ne kaha ki jab rigerv bank kii jimmedaariyon ke bare main baaten aspasht hon, to uske kadam ko lekar lagaataar sawaal uthte rahenge
 He said that the role of the Reserve Bank in terms of macroeconomic stability is still unclear

 The Supreme Court has refused to hear the petition filed by social activist Teesta Setalvad on the order of a court in Ahmedabad to issue a stay order

 Teesta had filed a petition in the Supreme Court to issue a stay order on this order
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne kaha ki vah punarvichaar sambandhi praadhikaran nahin ho saktaa or aavedak uchit nyaayik manch par apni guhaar laga saktaa he
 On this, the counsel of Teesta thought it appropriate to withdraw his application and after that the court issued its order

 Because of this, the petition is dismissed
 peeth ne spasht kiya ki vah daawa adaalat ke faisle kii andruni baton main nahin ja rahi
 The bench said that we are clarifying that we have not given our opinion on the features of the order
 jab bhi ise chunauti di jaaegi, tab sambandhit adaalat uskaa apane hisaab se nirikshan karegi
 The application is rejected due to withdrawal

 inaki jagah laal-hare rang vaali bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kii rashtriya adhyakshamayawatike sadhkhilesh yadavaki tasviir vaale hording ne le lee he
 The atmosphere of this road is clearly telling that distances have been reduced politically between the two poles parties SP and BSP
 14 march ko jaise hi gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav ke nattejey aae, kai baaten spasht ho gayi
 First, despite many setbacks, the bsp's ability to transfer its core vote to another party in the election remains intact
 doosraa,sapa or basapagathjod bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke vijay rath ko usee prakaar chunauti de saktaa he, jis prakaar 25 varsh pehle isi gathbandhan ne ram lahar ko tham liya tha
 Mayawati took the initiative by supporting the SP candidate in the Lok Sabha by-elections, but after winning the elections in Gorakhpur and Phulpur on March 14, Akhilesh laid the foundation of the future alliance by expressing gratitude at the house of the BSP President at Mall Avenue, Lucknow
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle banane vaale kisi bhi bhaajapa virdohi gathbandhan kii jarurat 2014 ke aam chunaav ke aankadon se spasht ho jaati he
 The BJP alliance had won 73 seats in Uttar Pradesh's 80 Lok Sabha seats and set the scattered opposition alive
 agar pichley loksabhaa chunaav main hi sapa-basapa ek hokar ladatin to inaki jholii main aadhi se adhik loksabhaa siten aatin
 If the Congress and other smaller parties were also involved in this alliance, then more than two-thirds of the seats would have been won
 (dekhen graphics) pichley loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav haarane ke baad sapa or basapa har haal main loksabhaa chunaav main palatwaar karne ko betaab hai
 Professor at Kashi Hindu University, Dr
 ajit kumaar kehete hai, "dalit, obisi or muslim gathjod par banane vaale sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke paas upi kii har loksabhaa seat par kam se kam 30 pratishat aadhaar vot maujuud rahegaa
 If these parties managed to get the same votes as in the 2014 general elections, then the BJP may face difficulties
 ''pichley varsh 27 agast ko patna main rashtriya janata dal kii raily se teen din pehle basapa supremeo mayawati ne isamen shaamil hone ko lekar chal rahi sambhaavnaaon ko sire se nakaar diya tha
 She appeared to the media and said, "the concern of the BSP is not to create public distrust of such alliances based on the arrogance of ticket distribution among secular parties and the experience of stabbing in the back
" aakhir iskaa laabh bhaajapa ko na mil jaae
 The formation of an alliance depends entirely on the seat sharing
 '' yahi vajah rahi ki phulpur or gorakhpur sansadeey upachunaav main sapa pratyaashee ko basapa kaa samarthan dene ke baad uthe gathbandhan ke sawaal ko mayawati ne nakaara
 He said, "it is not the alliance but the strong candidate who defeated the BJP has the support of the BSP
" '' loksabhaa upachunaav main jeet ke baad sapa ke kuch bade netaa basapa ke saath sambhavit gathjod ko lekar khaasi mashkkat kar rahe hai
 They are trying to find a seat sharing formula that is logically acceptable to all members of the coalition
 sapa ke ek varisht netaa or vidhaan parishad sadsy bataate hai, "siton ke bantwaare kaa sabase taarkik tarika yah he ki gathbandhan kaa dal un siton par chunaav lade jinhen pichley loksabhaa chunaav main usne jeeta tha or jin par vah dal duusare number par rahaa tha
 "even though the BSP may not have won a single seat in the last Lok Sabha election, this party was second in 34 seats
 isi prakaar 5 siten jeetne vaali sapa 31 siton par duusare number par thi
 At the same time, the Congress may have won two seats but in 6 seats this party was second
 rashtriya lokdal (ralod) or aam aadmi party (aap) bhi ek-ek seat par duusare number par thi
 If consensus is reached on this formula, then SP and BSP can contest on 34 seats
 gathbandhan kaa hissaa banane par congress ko 8 or ralod ko 2 loksabhaa siton par mauka mil saktaa he
 Several leaders have joined the SP, including Pramod Kumar Maurya, nephew of Labor Minister Swami Prasad Maurya and former president of Pratapgarh Zilla Panchayat in the Nigahabhajpa government on smaller parties
 akhilesh ke saath khadey hokar pramod kumaar maury ne kaha, "swami prasad maury hamaare netaa hai
 The BJP has sidelined them
 yah hamaari maury birdari katai sahan nahin karegi
 After this, Dr
 Surgeon, son-in-law of Swami Prasad Maurya, a cancer surgeon
 naval kishor ne laal topi pahanakar sapa mukhyalay main akhilesh yadav ko loksabhaa upachunaav kii badhai di
 It is clear that Akhilesh Yadav is weaving the fabric of the non-yadav backward castes
 upachunaav nateezon ne ralod sareekhe dalon main bhi aas jagaa di he
 RLD president Ajit Singh announced to join any anti-bjp alliance
 bhaajapa saansad hukum singh ke nidhan se khaali hui kairana sansadeey seat or bhaajapa vidhayak lokentre pratap singh ke nidhan se rikt hui bijanour jile kii nurpur vidhansabha seat par upachunaav hone par sapa kairana seat par ralod ummidavaar kaa samarthan kar sakati he
 The challenge of stopping polarization is the possibility of polarization in opposition to Muslim votes when the SP, BSP and other parties come together
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main basapa ne 19 or sapa ne 14 musalmaan ummidavaar utaare the
 The BJP had cleverly succeeded in polarizing a large section of non-jatav Dalits and non-yadav backward in opposition to Muslim votes
 rajnatik vishleshak 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main musalmaan ummidavaaron kii hode hone kii sambhaavna se inkaar karte hai
 Associate Professor at Aligarh Muslim University, Dr
 jasim mohammad bataate hai, "sapa or basapa ke alag chunaav ladane se donon partiyon main muslim ummidavaar dene kii hode rahati thi
 This competition will end by coming together
 sapa-basapa or duusare dalon ke sambhavit gathbandhan se hindu ummidavaaron ko bhi musalamaanon kaa ekatarfa vot milegaa
 This will not force the coalition to field more Muslim candidates
 '' akhilesh bhale hi basapa ko saath lene par behad utsahit hai lekin abhi aage kaa rasta kathin he
 Ram Sahai, a Dalit officer working in the irrigation department, says, "the SP government was opposed to reservation in promotion
 inke kaarykaal main 18,000 se zyada adhikari padonnat kiye gaye
 The future of the alliance will depend on the sp's stand on the issue of reservation in promotion
 ''shaayad upi kaa raajnneetik itihaas 25 varsh baad doharaaya jaae
 In 1993, BSP founder Kanshi Ram and SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav came together to stop the BJP riding on the Ram wave
 tab ek naaraa uchhla tha— "mili mulaayam-kanshiram, hawa main ud gaye jai shriram
 After 25 years, Akhilesh and Mayawati are united to stop the Modi wave
 is baar kaa naaraa he— "bahanji or akhilesh jude, modi-yogi ke hosh ude

 a few hours after the ten terrorists attacked Mumbai on November 26, 2008, Shazia Geelani sent an email to her husband David Coleman Headley in coded signs

 In the 1980s, he used to frequent the smuggling of drugs in the Golden Crescent of afghanistan-pakistan, the largest area of drug trafficking in the world
 lekin aage chalakar vah duusare sabase bade niryaat—aatankwaad ke dhandhe main shaamil ho gaya
 Headley is desired not only for plotting the 26 / 11 attack but also for planning an attack in March 2009 at the National Defense University of Delhi as well as tourist destinations in Pune and Goa
 is uniwarsity main sashastr balon ke varisht adhikariyon or naukarshahon ko training di jaati he
 The Home Ministry has demanded the extradition of Headley and the pakistani-canadian Tahawwur Rana involved in the conspiracy with him in a separate case filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA)

 "headley is a link that connects all the broken links of 26 / 11," says an NIA official

 Not just because of his bizarre eyes — right eye blue and left eye deep brown — but also because of his great aspirations

 Patton's famous line is - Dum nah toh yash nahi (no Guts no Glory)
 hedli kaa yahi moolmantra tha
 When he told the agency that Pakistan's ISI used lashkar-e-tayyiba as a tactical weapon in the war against India, those officials found that Headley was the instigating agent who led the 26 / 11 attack Worked on increasing the size
 ek khufia adhikari ke anusaar, ''vahiin se mumbai par hamale kii yojana ankurit hui
 On receiving important information from Headley, the ISI and Lashkar's confidence increased and they were ready for a much bigger attack
 ” abhi tak duniya main mumbai par hamalaa ekmaatr aisa hamalaa he, jisamen aadhunik aatankwaad ke sabhi tatv shaamil hai—samudr ke raste ghuspaith, fidaayin commando or visphotakon se bhare vaahan

 Headley refused to attack Matoshri, the residence of Shiv Sena chief Bala Saheb Thackeray, as he argued that the attackers could not go to his home in Bandra, 15 km from Colaba

 She left the infant — named Dawood Gilani at the time — to her ex-husband but brought her to America in 1977
 vah ek nite club 'khaybar paas’ ke upar bane ek apartment main apni maa ke saath rahane laga
 Her mother ran a nightclub in Philadelphia with her husband, born in Afghanistan
 hedli us club main manager ke rup main kaam karata tha
 Kadamheadli reached Pakistan in the early 1980s in the drug trade

 Headley had opened an office at Tardeo AC Market in South Mumbai and lived as a paying guest in a house of Breach Candy, located a few steps from there

 vah cigarette yaa sharaab nahin peetaa tha, lekin kabhi-kabhi dom perignon (shampen) kii chuskee le liya karata tha
 It was because of his passion for good clothes that people started calling him 'david Armani'

 "headley is a criminal inspired by 3W — wine, women and wealth (wine, woman and money)," Bhatt told India Today
 ” unhone bataaya, ''vah khud ko zyada aankane vaala, atmamugdh or chaalaak he

 vah aatankwaad ke liye sambhavit nishaanon par baatcheet ke liye 'miki mouse project’ jaise code verde kaa istemaal karata tha or apni mul pahchaan chhipaane ke liye iesady kol main rana se angreji main baat karata tha, apni paaramparik bhashaa punjabi main nahin

 Once Bhatt jokingly called him 'agent Headley', he was filled with anger
 is bich uske vyabhichaari rishton ke daur lagaataar jari rahe
 In February 2007, he met an attractive Moroccan girl, Faiza, at a friend's house in Lahore during a nine-time trip between Mumbai and Pakistan to meet his Lashkar and ISI bosses

 march 2007 main vah faeja ko lekar mumbai aayaa, jahaan donon ne taj mahal hotel kaa gahanta se jayja liya, jo tab hamale ke liye ekmaatr nishaanaa chunaa gaya tha
 Headley also had a Sony Ericsson phone from the ISI which enabled him to record video in detail of the interiors and rooms of the hotel

 He had said that when he spoke to American agents, he already had a file about Headley
 mahatvapurn yah he ki aisi koi bhi khufia jaankaree kabhi bhi bhartiya agenciyon ke saath saz nahin kii gai
 There is anger among Indian security establishments about this
 faeja-hedli kaa rishta matbhedon se bharaa, hinsak tha or 2008 main iskaa ant ho gaya
 By the way, in 2007, Headley's thinking was concentrated elsewhere
 iesai or uskaa paaltu lashkar, donon dabaav main the
 The ISI wanted to prevent Kashmir-based jihadist organizations from associating with the Taliban
 lashkar khud aantarik sankat se guzar rahaa tha
 Headley has told the NIA that the organization was disbanding at the time
 lashkar ke do ahm aatanki sargana alag hokar afghanistan main ladgaye chale gaye the
 Its military commander zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi was finding it very difficult to keep the rest of his terrorists united and inspire them to fight for Kashmir
 hedli ne kaha, ''isaki vajah se ve bharat ke khilaaf ek 'jabardast’ aatanki hamalaa karne par majaboor hue

 His eligibility to become a hidden big international terrorist was as addictive as the Afghan heroin he had become accustomed to in the 1980s
 lashkar se alag hue karachi sthit sanghathan 'jund-ul-fida’ kii taraf se kai thikaanon kii toh lete hue usne yojana banaai ki bandookdhaari aatankiyon ko dilli ke neshnal dephence uniwarsity main ghusaaya ja saktaa he or vahaan bhartiya sashastr sena ke itane zyada varisht adhikariyon kii hatya kii ja sakati he, ''jitne pakistan ke saath bharat ke yuddh main bhi nahin maare gaye honge

 British agencies reported this to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and were eventually arrested before being attacked in Copenhagen

 "from the perspective of a professional intelligence officer fighting terror, it is very important to get information from Headley about who was involved, how it all happened," says Reidel
 isse is bare main gahari andruni jaankaree mili he ki lashkar or uski sangrakshak iesai kaise kaam kar rahi hai
 "despite the statements being made publicly, the likelihood of Headley's extradition is very slim
" 29 janvari ko ek press conference main tatkaaleen america videsh mantri hillari kinglton ne kaha ki 26 / 11 ke peediton ko nyaay ek 'adhuraa kaam he’
 Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde will also emphasize the demand for extradition in front of US officials at a conference on security in early February
 enie ko ummid he ki use duusare number kaa mahatvapurn shaks mil saktaa he—hedli ke sahyogi rana kaa pratyrpan ho saktaa he
 a senior Intelligence Bureau (IB) official said, "but who knows if there is a person from India who is searching for America tomorrow, then Headley can become an object of bargain
" ”hedli ko 24 janvari ko jab sajaa sunai gai to vah asahajata se idhar-udhar ho rahaa tha or chicago courtroom kii farsh ko ghur rahaa tha

 england ke nae test captain jo root apni ballebaaji ko us str tak le janaa chaahate hai jahaan tak captain banane ke baad bharat ke viraat kohli or austrailia ke steve smith pahunche hai
 Significantly, Root has been named the new England Test captain after the resignation of Alastair Cook
 bharat ke khilaaf test siries main 0-4 kii haar ke baad cook ne england kii test captaini se istipha de diya tha
 Root is 52 in 53 Tests of his career so far
 80 ke ausat se 4594 ran bana chuke hai
 Kohli's average is above 67 after becoming captain and he is in the top 3 in the world rankings
 jo root ne kaha,‘viraat or steve smith ne jis tarah se pradarshan kiya he, main bhi vaise hi karnaa chahta hum
 i want to go to the same level, inspired by them
 har baccha ek din england kaa captain bananaa chahta he or mujhe yah mauka mila he lihaaja main apane pradarshan kii chhap chhodana chahta hum
 In Test cricket, Virat and Steve Smith's batting average is still above the route
 khaas baat yah he ki captaini sanbhaalane ke baad bhi in donon ne apni ballebaaji ko kisi bhi tarah prabhavit nahin hone diya he
 Joe Root also wants to perform like Virat and Smith
 smith ne ab tak 50 test main 60
 He has scored 4752 runs at an average of 15 which includes 17 centuries
 isi tarah viraat kohli ne 54 test main 51
 Has scored 4451 runs at an average of 75 which includes 16 centuries
 viraat is samay duniya ke aise ekmaatr ballebaaj hai jinka test, vanade or tii20, teenon kaa ausat 50 se adhik kaa he
 Joe Root said, 'I want to do the way Virat and Steve Smith have performed
 main unase prerit hokar usee str tak janaa chahta hum
 Every child wants to be the captain of England one day and i have got this opportunity, so i want to leave an impression of my performance
 ’ test cricket main viraat or steve smith kaa ballebaaji ausat abhi root se upar he
 The special thing is that even after assuming the captaincy, these two have not let their batting be affected in any way
 jo root bhi viraat or smith kii tarah pradarshan karnaa chaahate hai
 Smith has so far scored 60 in 50 tests
 15 ke ausat se 4752 ran banaae hai jisamen 17 shatak shaamil hai
 Similarly, Virat Kohli scored 51 in 54 tests
 75 ke ausat se 4451 ran banaae hai jisamen 16 shatak shaamil hai
 Virat is currently the only batsman in the world to have Test, ODI and T20 average of more than 50
 madhya pradesh ke indore main jis makaan ko giraane pahunchi nigam kii team ke afasar ko bijepi vidhayak akaash vijayawargeey ne bat se maaraa tha usee makaan kaa maamla ab hoicourt pahunch gaya he
 a petition has been filed in Indore bench of the High Court regarding the dilapidated house of Ganji Compound of Indore
 yah yachika kirayedar parivaar ne lagaai he, jisamen akaash vijayawargeey ke vakil pushyamitra bhargav kirayedar parivaar kaa paksh hoicourt main rakhenge jis par mangalvaar ko sunwaayee hogi
 Due to this hearing, whether the hammer will run on this building on Tuesday will depend on the court's decision
 isse pehle nigam kamishnar ashish singh ne saaf kiya tha indore nagar nigam kii team mangalvaar ko jarjar makaan par demolision kii karrwai karegi
 Explain that before the monsoon, Indore Municipal Corporation has identified 26 such houses in Indore which are in a very shabby condition and can fall during the rains
 indore nagar nigam kii team aise 10 makaanon ko to gira bhi chuki thi or ganji compound kaa yah makaan 11waan makaan tha jahaan nigam kii team karrwai ke liye pahunchi, lekin bijepi vidhayak akaash vijayawargeey ne yahaan pahunchakar team ko makaan nahin todane diya or nigam adhikari par bat se hamalaa bhi kar diya
 After this, the controversy arising increased the troubles of Akash Vijayvargiya
 ghayal adhikari kii shikaayat par akaash vijayawargeey ke khilaaf exiaar darj hui or unhen 4 din jail main bitaane pade, haalanki akaash vijayawargeey ab jamaanat par baahar aa chuke hai or baahar aate hi unhone saaf kar diya he makaan ke maamle main wo kirayedar parivaar ke samarthan main khadey rahenge
 CBI probe recommendation: Akash Vijayvargiya has written a letter to Chief Minister Kamal Nath, Home Minister Bala Bachchan and PWD Minister Sajjan Verma demanding a CBI inquiry into the shabby building scam of Indore
 patr main akaash ne aarope lagaaya he ki nagar palika nigam ke dwaara nirdhan besahaara logon ke hamalon ko jarjar ghoshit kar todane kii karrwai kii ja rahi he
 It is being aimed at benefiting a particular person
 notebandi ke 9 maheene bitne ke baad bijepi kii atal vihari bajpeyi sarkaar main vitt mantri rahe yashavanth sinha kah rahe hai ki maujuuda modi sarkaar ne pichhali sarkaron se mili ek swasth hoti arthvyavastha ko mandi kii ore dhakel diya he
 Sinha says that there are many leaders who believe in him in the party circles but due to this he is unable to speak anything
 sinha kaa kahana he vah desh ke prati apni jimmedaari nibhaate hue modi sarkaar kii aarthik nitiyon kii aalochana kar rahe hai
 However, Sinha is not the first leader, economist or former minister to question the decision on demonetisation
 beete 9 maheenon ke dauraan purv pradhanmantri is galat faisla qaraar de chuke hai
 Many economists of the country and the world are also arguing that this decision of demonetisation can never fulfill its purpose
 purv arabiai governor daawa kar chuke hai ki yah modi sarkaar kaa jaldbaaji main liya faisla he jiskaa lambey arse tak arthvyavastha par nakaaratmak asar rahegaa
 Apart from these, many global economic agencies have also claimed that demonetisation has put a brake on the Indian economy catching pace
 aise main un phaaydon kaa kya hua jo vitt mantralay samet kai sarkari or gaiyrsarkari sansthaaon ne aam aadmi ko dikhaaya tha
 At the same time, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley went a step ahead and put a full list of these benefits of demonetisation on his website
 kya ye sabhi phaayde mahaj modi sarkaar ke faislon par pardaa daalane ke liye ginaae gaye? ek-ek kar dekhne hai kaise dharaashai ho gaye notebandi se hone vaale phaaydon kii daleel:ise bhi padhein: notebandi, vitt mantralay, rigerv bank or rashtriya bhram1
 Prevention of corruption? The banned currency of 500 and 1000 rupees was 85 percent of the total currency in the country
 yah donon karency desh main bhrashtachar kii poshak bhi thi
 Since the decision of demonetisation, it was said to stop using this currency for corruption
 vahiin jari hui nai karency ko sarkaar ne dhire-dhire sanchalit kiya jisase aam aadmi kii dikkatein badhin lekin beete 9 maheenon ke dauraan jaanch agenciyon kii chhapemari main baraamad hui nai karency se yah saaf he ki nai karency ne puraani karency kii jagah lene main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 2
 cashles iconomi?notebandi ke faisle par modi sarkaar ne kaha tha ki cashles iconomi banane ke liye jaruri he ki desh main zyada se zyada tranjaction digital madhyamon se kiya jaae
 This will reduce the country's dependence on currency and the central government along with the Reserve Bank and other banks will have to spend less in currency operations
 cashles iconomi kaa phayda sarkaar ke revenue main ijaphe ke saath-saath aam aadmi ko bhi hoga kyonki uskaa paisa digital aadan-pradaan main zyada surakshit rahegaa
 But the cost of printing of new currency and currency communication during the last 9 months cleared the profits of the Reserve Bank
 3
 Restricting fake currency? While deciding to ban notation, the government had said that there was a serious problem of flow of fake currency from across the country
 nakli karency jiske haath pahunchati thi use utane mulya kaa turant nuksaan uthaanaa padataa tha
 At the same time, the government also had to resort to large networks for its prevention
 lihaaja sarkaar ne daawa kiya ki karency kaa kam istemaal (digital pement) or bade dinomination kii karency se ek jatke main desh se nakli karency saaf ho jaaegi
 At the same time, because of the new security standard of the new currency, the economy will be protected from fake currency for the next several years
 aise phaayde par bhi pani phir chukaa he kyonki beete 9 maheenon ke dauraan badi maatra main desh se nai nakli karency ko baraamad kiya he
 4
 real estate sector hoga paardarshee?sarkaar ko ummid thi ki notebandi kaa sabase bada phayda real estate sector main hoga
 For many decades, the real estate sector was the biggest source of black money investment
 iske chalate kaagajon par property kii kharid or vaastavik kharid main bada antar hona aam baat thi
 Due to this, the government had a big loss in stamp duty, while the common man had to face difficulties in buying houses due to not having black money
 lekin beete 9 maheenon ke dauraan real estate sector kii haalat or kharaab ho chuki he
 More than a dozen big real estate projects are stuck, while many big companies are facing the risk of bankruptcy
 5
 Will black money end? After demonetisation, the work of bringing social change against black money in the country can be done easily
 yah hakeekat he ki kisi bhi arthvyavastha se kalaadhan tab tak nahin khatm kiya ja saktaa jab tak saamaajik str par iskaa bahishkaar na hone lage
 Until now, black money was invested in property and gold and silver, so that their value was always higher than the actual price
 ab notebandi ke baad in kshetron main kaledhan ke istemaal par ankush lagegaa
 This was expected by the Central Government lekin agast 2017 main aae arabiai ke aankadon ne is phaayde par bhi pani pher diya kyonki notebandi kii prakriya main 99 fisadi pratibandhit karency bainkon ke jariye arabiai ke paas pahunch gai
 6
 band hogi samanaantar iconomi?kaledhan or bhrashtachar kaa sahaara lekar desh main hameshaa se ek samanaantar iconomi chalati thi
 In the country, from coal mining to roadside tea and vegetable vendors, they were involved in this parallel economy
 yahaan zyaadaatar log desh kii sakal gharelu aay ko nuksaan pahunchaate hue apni aarthik gatividhiyon ko chalaate the
 The government was of the view that the trend towards digital payments after demonetisation and the black money eradicated from demonetisation would be easy to mainstream this parallel economy
 lekin beete 9 maheene ke dauraan aarthik sthiti or kharaab ho chuki he
 The manufacturing sector as well as the service sector are witnessing a steady decline
 7
 Tax base will increase? The biggest benefit of promoting digital payments in the country will be that the largest and the smallest transactions will be recorded with the banks
 in tranjaction par inakam tex vibhaag kii bhi lagaataar najar rahegi
 When there is no basis for black economy in the country, then obviously more and more people will be able to fulfill their horse-trading only after paying tax
 isse kendra sarkaar kii revenue main teji se oochaal dekhne ko milegaa, uskaa vittiya ghaataa kam hoga or desh ke infrastracchar ko sudhaarney ke liye uske paas paryaapt sansaadhan rahenge
 But the post-demonetisation data showed that the Central Government did not benefit from this decision in revenue
 8
 Financial savings will be increased Before the ban, people in the country used to invest their savings in property, gold and jewelery
 jarurat padane par log ise bechakar karency main badal lete the
 Currently, more than 50 percent of the country's households keep their savings in these ways
 kya yahaan nivesh hua adhikansh paisa blikemani he? sarkaar ko ummid thi ki notebandi ke baad real estate or sona apeksha ke mutabik ritern nahin den paaenge lihaaja logon apni sevings ko rakhane ke liye bainkon kaa rukh karenge or seaving bank, demand draft or mutual fund jaise vikalpon main nivesh badhenga
 But even banks did not get this benefit
 ise bhi padhein: kaledhan ke khilaaf sargical strike ke liye yaad rahegaa kiya jayega 20169
 Banks' earnings will increase? The government had counted that with the ban on black money from demonetisation, along with the fast growing digital payments, banks will see a big increase in earnings
 is ijaphe kaa istemaal bank apana vistaar karne ke saath-saath graahakon ko lubhaane ke liye karengi
 On the other hand, the money collected by banks with demonetisation will also help them to overcome their old losses
 lekin 9 maheenon ke dauraan bainkon main susti chai hui he or unke enpie jas kaa tas barkaraar hai
 At the same time banking has become expensive for the common man
 notebandi ke baad deshbhar ke bainkon ne graahakon ko di jane vaali kai muft sevaaon par charge laga diya he
 10 loans will be cheaper? Financial experts were quoted as saying that the benefit to banks since demonetisation is going to have a direct impact on interest rates in the country
 vittiya jagat main paardarshita ke saath-saath bank apana kaarobaar failaane ke liye zyada se zyada karj dene kii koshish karenge
 At the same time, to lure customers, he can announce a big cut in the interest rates on the loan
 isse desh main ghar kharidne, car yaa scooter kharidne athwa kaarobaar ke liye karj saste daron main milanaa shuru ho jaaenge
 Significantly, after the demonetisation, the RBI has cut the repo repo rate twice, but at the moment, the banks have failed to make this deduction completely to the customers
 philhal saste karj kaa intjaar aam aadmi ke saath-saath kaarobaari kar rahaa he
 Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat has been summoned by the CBI to appear in connection with the investigation of the Sting case
 is sting ke kathith taur par unhen ek patrkaar se baagi vidhayakon kaa phir se samarthan hasil karne ke liye deal karte hue dikhaaya gaya he

Till then none of the mlas who were technically disqualified talked to me, what difference does it make?

 He said, 'if there is any evidence against me that i offered money or anything to anyone, then hang me at the clock tower
 ' gauratlab he ki ghantaghar chowk dehradun ke bilkul bichombich sthit he
 Rawat will be questioned on Monday
 ravivaar ko unhone video main maujuud hone kii baat sweekaar kii thi or kaha tha ki ek patrkaar se milanaa aparaadh nahin he
 However, till now they have been challenging the validity of this CD as fake
 harish ravat ne dehradun main ek kaarykram main bhaag lene ke baad samvaadadaataaon se ek baatcheet main kaha, 'kya kisi patrkaar se milanaa koi aparaadh he? tab tak takneekee rup se ayogy ghoshit nahin hue vidhayakon main se kisi ne bhi mujhase baatcheet kii to isse kya fark padataa he? raajnneeti main kya kisi channel ko ham band kar sakate hai?' Claiming his innocence in this regard, the former Chief Minister said that if anything from the CD is certified that he offered cash or any other kind in exchange for taking the support of the disgruntled mlas, he would be hanged in front of the public Are ready
 unhone kaha, 'agar mere khilaaf aisa koi pramaan miltaa he ki ki maine kisi ko dhan yaa kisi or cheez kii peshkash kii to mujhe ghantaghar par lataka dijie

 The Ministry of Environment has withheld forest clearance for this project
 urisa ke ispaat evam udyog mantri raghunatha mohanti kaa maananaa he ki posco kii yah pariyojna aage badhegi
 He dismissed all speculation and said, "we are confident that Posco will be able to set up the unit near Paradip
" urisa ke mukhyamantri naveen patnayak ne bhi isse pehle kaha tha ki unhen ab bhi bharosa he ki yah swapnil pariyojna amal main aegi
 But the way the project is coming one after the other, it has reduced the number of people who are able to trust Patnaik's belief

 President of the Posco Resistance Movement Committee, Abhay Sahu said, despite all efforts, the government has not been able to provide even an inch of land to Posco
 ham apane adhikaron ke liye sangharsh karte rahenge
 As per the provisions of the mou, the company was to commission a 6 million tonne capacity unit in July 2010 or 36 months after taking possession of the land
 pariyojna sthal ke paas ke saat gaanvon main se do ke log is pariyojna kaa purajor virodh kar rahe hai, jisase is par kaam aage nahin bad sakaa he
 However, the project has the support of the Prime Minister as well as the Chief Minister of the state
 ol urisa steel poundation ke adhyaksh pi el kandoi ne kaha, jis tarah se is pariyojna ke raste main adchane aa rahi hai, aise main sirf samay hi iskaa bhavishya tay karegaa
 An executive of the company said on the condition of confidentiality that even if Posco gets the land, it will not be possible for the company to proceed with the construction until it is assured of raw material supply
 katak ke log company dwaara mahanadi nadi ke naraj baandh se pani nikaalane kii yojana kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, Posco is also opposing mining of ore from Khandadhar iron ore reserves in Sundargarh district

 After analyzing these pictures sent on isro's website, 'heavy rain or cloudburst' was predicted and 11 places in Uttarakhand were red marked
 barkot, kirtinagar, muni kii reti, narendra nagar, paudi, raywala, rishikesh, rudraprayag, srinagar, tehri or uttarkashi kuch ghanton main baari barish kii chapet main aa jaaenge
 It is not yet clear whether these photos were sent to the Indian Meteorological Department in time
 india today group ke angreji samachar channel hedlins today dwaara khabar dene ke baad isro ne site ko achaanak badal diya he or us par likh diya ki sab praayogic he
 Less than 24 hours after the ISRO got the pictures, heavy rains started wreaking havoc in all these places
 1,000 se zyada log maare gaye or 5,000 se zyada log ab bhi laapata hai
 The exact number of deaths is still being estimated
 2004 ke disambar main ai sunami ke baad desh main yah sabase bhayanak prakritik aapadaa he
 The foul smell of dead bodies now permeates the air
 is vinaash ne prakritik sankat se nibatane main bharat kii taiyaari par sawalia nishaan laga diya he
 The 2009 report of the Ministry of Home Affairs is very clear about the dangers facing the country
 report ke anusaar, 35 main se 27 rajyon or centreshasit pradeshon main aapadaa kii ashanka rahati he
 About 58 of the country
 6 pratishat bhubhag bukamp kii ashanka vaala kshetra he
 40 million hectares (12 percent land area) is prone to floods and erosion, 5,700 km of the total coastline of 7,516 km can be affected by storm and tsunami, 68 percent of the total agricultural area is prone to drought
 , Mountainous areas are at risk of landslides and icy storms
 sankat kaa akalan karne vaali british company maplacraft ne pichley saal bangladesh, philippines, dominican republic or myanmar ke baad bharat ko paanchvaan sabase zyada prakritik vinaash kii ashanka vaala desh bataaya tha
 India appears quite ready on paper to deal with natural calamities
 iske paas doorasanvedi upkarnon kaa puraa tantra he, jo duniya ke aise sabase bade tantron main se ek he
 It has 11 satellites that can detect any change in weather, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister, has an annual budget of Rs 800 crore
 kaa he
 This central machinery is connected to the state governments, which is the first to be active during any crisis
 lekin uttarakhand ne dikhaa diya he ki is baari-bharkam mashin kaa pahiyaa jarurat ke samay kitni dhimi raftaar se chalata he
 The armed forces were called by the state government on 17 June and that too when Union Water Resources Minister Harish Rawat called Defense Minister A

 agar rajya sarkaar or sashastr balon ke bich sidhe baatcheet hui hoti to sankat kaa sahi-sahi byora diya ja saktaa tha or phir sena jaldi sakriy ho gai hoti
 But this is just one example of a lot of mistakes
 purv chetavanee se jaan kii surakshasrkaar ne june, 2008 main uttarakhand ke liye do dopalar radaaron kii manjuuri di thi
 These radars detect the exact size of the clouds and give immediate warning up to eight hours in advance
 lekin unhen sthapit nahin kiya ja sakaa, kyonki rajya sarkaar unke liye nainital or musuri main jameen hi uplabdh nahin kara saki
 In October 2009, when the Krishna river in Andhra Pradesh had the worst flood of this century, the state government was ready to deal with it
 baadh samvedi upkarnon ne use nadi main pani badaae kii chetavanee de di thi or computaron ne graph se dikhaa diya tha ki koun se ilaake baadh se prabhavit honge
 As a result, 100,000 people were evacuated to safer places in time before the floods
 us prakritik aapadaa main sirf 37 logon kii hi jaan gai thi
 Quickly reaching the site of destruction, Uttarakhand, located in the sensitive area of himalayas, never felt the need to create its own State Disaster Management Force (SDRF)
 keval bihar, orissa, rajasthan, gujarat, maharashtra or nagaland ne hi apane yahaan esadiaref batalian banaai he, jisamen aapadaa ke samay logon ko bachaane ke liye 1,000 prashikshit jawan hote hai
 The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has directed to create such a force
 uttarakhand prashasan ko yah samajhne main kareeb do din lag gaye ki 14-17 june ke bich hui baari barish se nibatna neshnal dizaster respance force (andiaref) kii kshamta se baahar kii baat he
 By then, by June 19, many people had been killed
 isaki sabase badi vajah yah thi ki baari barish, baadh or bhuskhalan kii vajah se kai jagahon par mobile tower gir gaye the
 Due to this, contact with many parts of Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Uttarkashi and Pithoragarh was disconnected by phone and they were isolated
 is tarah kii immergency main kam-se-kam do mahatvapurn yojanaayen ab bhi lalaphitaashahee main fansi hui hai
 In 2003, the satellite-based communication system proposed by the Department of Space should have been established by 2005
 lekin vah ab bhi yojana ke str par hi ataki hui he, jabaki 2006 main hi 6 karod ru
 The necessary equipment was manga
 2007 se rashtriya aapadaa sanchaar network banane kii yojana banaai ja rahi he
 Even simpler solutions, such as satellite phones, were not purchased
 is aapadaa ke ek hafte baad grih mantralay ne hadabadi main honkong se 200 satellite phone mangaaye or unhen rajya main raahat ke kaam main juty andiaref kii batalian ko bheja gaya
 Local broadcast facility was also not considered as a cheap solution
 efem transmeter lagane main sirf ek lakh ru
 Costs
 sarkaar chaahati to use hi har jile main laga sakati thi, taaki mobile phone par sandesh die ja saken
 Necessary synergy between Center and State The Ministry of Home Affairs formed a supreme body headed by the Prime Minister in 2005, to carry out central rescue work during the national disaster in the country
 aath varshon main paanch badi aapadaaen ho chuki hai, lekin endieme apane makasad main puri tarah vifal rahaa he
 "the NDMA was found to be ineffective in most areas," says the report of the Controller General of Accounts (CAG) tabled in Parliament in April 2013
 ’’ 10 mahatvapurn yojanaayen yaa to adhuri chhod di gayi yaa ve apane nirdhaarit samay se bahut peeche chal rahi thim
 a senior NDMA official says she is lagging behind because she has no control over the administration of the state
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘hamaare paas unhen audit karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 We cannot say anything to the responsible officials if the plan is not completed
 yahaan tak ki ham unhen dishanirdeshon kaa paalan karne ke liye bhi kuch nahin bol sakate
 The notification of the National Disaster Management Act was issued six years ago, but the national plan for the preparation of the destruction has not yet been prepared
 inamen sabase zyada mahatvapurn yah tha ki sankat ke samay sabhi sansadhano, vyaktiyon, saamagree or mashinari ko aapas main jodgaye ke liye ek ekikrut cmand banaaya jaae
 The account of national disaster preparedness has not been prepared, as the meeting of the National Executive Committee headed by the Union Home Secretary has not taken place in recent months
 bachaav kaa dhaancha banaaenuttarakhand main bachaav ke kaam main lage helicopteron ke paas pahaado main fanse logon se sampark karne kaa koi bhi saadhan nahin tha
 For many years, rescue teams around the world used helicopters equipped with sound equipment
 ye upkaran aapadaa prabhavit kaaphi bade ilaake ko cover karte hue bachaav ke nirdesh bhej sakate hai
 The lives of many people worldwide have been saved by platforms such as baskets launched by these helicopters
 uttarakhand main sirf ek choper ke paas aisi suvidha thi
 These rescue agencies did not have many of life-saving equipment, such as portable bridges that could be brought down by helicopter, ready-made dry food, gas masks, large solar-powered water filter plants, and extremely lightweight thermal Blankets and waterproof sheets
 agar kahin upkaran kharide bhi gaye the, to unka istemaal bhi nahin kiya gaya jaise synthetic aparchar radar ko 20 karod ru
 Was purchased in is radar kaa istemaal baadh kii chetavanee dene ke liye kiya jaataa he lekin uskaa istemaal ab tak nahin kiya gaya he
 There is not even a basic warning device, which was to be purchased after the December 2004 tsunami
 nicobar dweep samoohon main ab tak 147 siren nahin lag paae hai
 These sirens may warn people to flee before the tsunami
 yah is baat kaa pratik he ki aapadaa prabandhan ke maamle ham ab bhi kitne laaparvaah hai

 Ponting has hit 32 at the number three, but has never been able to hit a hundred at number four
 is number par unka ucchtam score 78 ran he jo unhone haal main newjiland ke khilaaf brisben main banaaya tha

 Imran Khan, who was at the forefront of the race to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan, was different as a cricketer
 unke samakaleen rahe bharat ke purv captain anshuman gaekwad ne kaha ki imran ko is baat kaa bakhubi ahsaas bhi tha
 Speaking to PTI, Gaikwad said, 'imran was the most different
 unka baat karne kaa tarika, uski shakhsiyat, sabhi juda thi
 The difference between him and the rest of the team was easily known
 ’apane khel ke alaava khubsuurati ke kaaran bhi imran ke prashansakon kii badi taadaad thi or gaekwad kaa maananaa he ki us samay unako sirf ek hi vyakti takkar de saktaa tha or vah the mansoor ali khan pataudi
 Imran, who has been the captain of the impossible in cricket, said, 'not only India or Pakistan, there was a huge fan of Imran everywhere
 itnaa khubasurat, lanbaa or unki style, hair style, ran- ap sabhi ke log diwane the
 i think no one other than Nawab Pataudi could compete with Imran
 ’unhone kaha,‘imran ko is baat kaa ahsaas bhi tha ki vah sabase alag hai
 He was very educated and versed and knew how to talk to whom
 vah adab se pesh aate the
 He had arrogance about himself, but did not express it all the time and everywhere
 ’yah poochne par ki kya maidan par bhartiya team imran ke saamne dabaav main rahati thi, unhone kaha ki vah hameshaa match vinar rahaa
 He said, 'he was a match winner and a different type of bowler
 unki style gaiyr paaramparik thi
 The biggest thing was that he used to bowl with the same spirit with the new or old ball
 unke paas raftaar or vividhta kaa anoothaa talmail tha
 Asked about any interesting incident with Imran, Gaikwad said, "we were sitting around the lunch table during a Test match in Lahore in 1984
 imran ne mujhase kaha ki vah cancer aspataal ke liye dhan jutanaa chaahate hai, to maine unhen raay di ki tumhaara itnaa rutaba or parichay he to britain main charity match kara lo
 Where he also played county cricket for Sussex
 ’unhone kaha ,‘agle satr main imran ne britain main do match karaae
 This is to say that it was interesting to talk to him, he never tried to let you down
 ’ According to a new book, a large part of the Pakistani army wants to negotiate with India under a change of strategy, but other options, including sub-conventional war, are kept open
 nai pustak ‘demokrasi: military politics in pakistan’ ke lekhak akil shah ne likhaa, jaisaa ki ek major general ne kaha, hamen bharat ke saath vaarta ko ek mauka dena chahie, lekin usase nipatane ke liye up-paramparaagat yuddh samet sabhi vikalp barkaraar rakhane chahie
 Shah, however, did not say which Major General he interviewed
 is pustak ko harvard uniwarsity ne prakashit kiya he
 This book, released over the weekend in the US, is the first detailed and historical study of Pakistan's military behavior in relation to India
 ek pratishthit uniwarsity ke raajnneeti vibhaag main lekturer shah ne likhaa ki bharat ke saath baatcheet kaa samarthan karne ko lekar pakistani sena ke rukh main aayaa yah badlaav suniyojit he taaki use apni samasyaon ko sulajhane ke liye samay mil sake
 Shah wrote, in view of the increasing threat in Pakistan and its economic weakness, many officials reluctantly accept that Islamabad's traditional Indian policy - that is, unconditionally supporting the Kashmiri right to self-determination in line with UN resolutions - might be desired The fruit is not finding and needs to be carefully re-evaluated
 shah ne likhaa, isliye kuch adhikari vaarta ko ek avasar dena chaahate hai or khule dimag se sabhi masalon kaa saamana karne kii vakaalat karte hai
 He wrote, in spite of disagreements about the best way to proceed, there is a consensus that in the case of Kashmir, there is a need to negotiate in a strong position to safeguard the national interest and this situation only after solving the internal problems of Pakistan Can be achieved

 ye points maa ke andar milk production ko sidhe taur par effect nahin karata lekin bachche ke prati uski pratikriya main badlaav ho sakate hai
 Its result will be that the child will drink less milk and may also have problems in milk production
 isliye aap unke (patni) saath rahen
 'view this post on instagramnew dads & loved ones listen up! Its World Breast feeding week and this post is for you to know that you can be the biggest support and encouragement to a new mom! a mother may be depressed, lacking in confidence, worried, or stressed and it affects breastfeeding
 These factors do not directly affect her milk production, but can interfere with the way in which she responds to her baby
 This can result in the baby taking less milk, and failing to stimulate milk production
 So be there for her 
 ❤️ Understanding the pressure on her physically and emotionally is the best thing you can do
 Nothing like feeling loved at such an overwhelming time
 🙌🏻
 i would also like to give a shoutout to moms who have struggled with low milk production 
 This could happen due to a pathological reason including endocrine problems or a host of other factors
 a few mothers have a physiological low breast-milk production, for no apparent reason, and production does not increase when the breastfeeding technique and pattern improve
 There is no reason to shame them or make them feel any pressure in not being able to BF
 we need to support all mothers and show love and respect 🍼

 Unreasonable of good rains in Central India The biggest reason behind the sowing of crop is believed to be the best rainfall in Central India
 monsoon sijan kii shuruyaat main yani june ke duusare hafte se hi desh main barish ne jor pakad liya tha or ye sthiti abhi bhi bani hui he
 Due to timely and widespread rainfall, farmers sowed the kharif crops extensively
 monsoon par nirbhar rahati he kharifakhrif sijan kii mukhya fasal dhan he or isaki monsoon par nirbharta kaaphi had tak he
 This time due to good rains, the sowing area of the country was 352 last year
 23 lakh hectare ke mukaable 363
 Has been 07 lakh hectares
 yani dhan utpaadak rajyon main rakabe main badhotaree hui he
 With better sowing of paddy, there is a possibility of increasing its production and this time the farmers are likely to keep the cost down in this crop 
 mote anaajon kii buvaai main bhi badhotareemote anaajon kii kharif buvaai bhi is baar pichley saal ke mukaable takreeban 10
 262 hectares increased to 172

 vahiin duusari tarafganneki baat karen to iskaa buvaai rakabaa kamobesh pichley saal ke 4
 05 lakh hectares reduced to 45
 55 lakh hectare rahaa he
 In case of increase in pulses increase, the sowing area has seen a tremendous increase this year
 pichley saal 26 agast tak daalon kii buvaai 103
 There were 85 lakh hectares of area
 lekin kharif sijan main is baar dalhan fasalon kaa buvaai rakabaa 139
 Has been 42 lakh hectares
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab ye hua ki is samay daalon kii badi hui keemton or behatar monsoon kaa asar daal kii buvaai par bhi dikh rahaa he
 Due to this, the prices of pulses are likely to soften in the coming days

 com / 2wsvvxykda Australia cricket team opener David Warner has said that the steps taken by the ICC in recent times to reduce sledging have reduced the thrill of cricket
 isisi ne haal ke dinon main kai baar cricket ko sajjan logon kaa khel banane ke liye kavayad bhi shuru kii he or kai baar is baat ko doharaaya bhi he
 Warner, however, has opposed the move to eliminate sledging altogether
 yahi kaaran he ki vyaktigat str par warner beete 18 maheenon main sledging ko lekar do maukon par jurmaane kaa shikaar hue hai
 He is fined once inside the field and once outside the field
 cricket dot com dot eyu ne warner se hawaale se likhaa he, "yah ek lihaaj se meri ore se isisi ko antim chetavanee he
 Such rules should be changed
 kisi kaa wicket lekar gendbaaj jashn manaate hue uski ore bad nahin saktaa, kyonki referi us par jurmaana laga degaa
 If all this continues, the players will have to find another way

 media main bhale hi is tarah kii ghatnaon ko badha-chadha kar pesh kiya jaataa ho, lekin inase hi cricket main romaanch bana hua he
 Warner said, "everyone watching the match on TV knows that it is not wrong
 yah gambhir baat bhi nahin he
 There is no risk on anyone
 yah logon ko manoranjan de rahaa he or aise main is tarah kii ghatnaayen band ho gayi to isse cricket neeras ho jayega

 Ankita got this success in her second attempt
 haryana kii ankitha rohtak ke paas kii rahane vaali hai or inke pita sugar mil main adhikari hai
 She got the inspiration to join civil services from her father and she got involved with it with great dedication and hard work
 enditivi se baatcheet ke dauraan unke vyaktitv ke bare main kai dilachasp baaten pataa chalin, khaskar padhai or uski ranneeti ko lekar
 Ankita graduated in chemistry from the Hindu College of Delhi University
 uske baad unhone iaiti dilli se isi vishay main post grajuation kii lekin jab civil kii pariksha main vaikalpik vishay chunane kii baat ai to unhone public administration yani lok prashasan vishay kaa chunaav kiya
 Regarding the choice of subjects, Ankita says that this is a very important decision and any student should choose the same subject in which he is interested
 iske saath hi subject kaa chunaav karte vakt har kisi ko us vishay kaa puraa silebus vistaar se dekhnaa or samajhnaa chahie
 Ankita gives two big reasons behind her own decision, the first is that according to her, the syllabus of public administration is slightly smaller than other subjects which can be prepared in the middle of the three months and another big reason is that Many topics of the subject are also useful for students in terms of GS
 apni sateek ranneeti or kadi mehnat ke dam par ankitha ne apane opshanal paper main 314 number hasil kiye hai
 Candidates preparing for the civil examination can benefit from Ankita's tips, which says that they should read the question at least twice and give a balanced answer to every aspect of the question while writing the answer
 uttar pustika kii swatchta par dhyaan den, margin yaa phir jahaan-tahaan na likhen
 Preparing for the main exam is a tiring task, so do not let your passion cool down
 jab kabhi jarurat mahasoos ho bich bich main brake len, mujeec sunen, doston se milen lekin is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki taiyaari ke bich kaa ye brake zyada lanbaa nahin hona chahie
 Regarding the interview, they believe that your personality is checked in this, knowledge is not a test, so do not let yourself get nervous
 aap khud ko ek jimmedaar naagarik ke taur par pesh karen
 There are many things about board members in the minds of many students, do not pay attention to them and keep yourself free from all kinds of pressure

 Former India captain Sourav Ganguly says that it is easy to captain Team India, but captaining an IPL team is very difficult
 tippaniyan According to the former captain, he never had to answer to the board for his decision while being the captain of Team India, whereas in the IPL he had to answer to the team owner
 ganguli ne kaha ki ipel main team maalik ko khush rakhana padataa he or har match ke baad maalik ko jawaab dena padataa he
 Ganguly also said that in order to avoid the team owner twice, he also switched off his mobile, but the team owner used to catch him for question and answer
 purv captain ke mutabik unhen team india kaa captain rahete kabhi bhi apane faisle ke liye board ko jawaab nahin dena padaa, jabaki ipel main unhen team maalik ko jawaab dena padataa tha
 Ganguly said that in the IPL, the team owner has to be happy and the owner has to answer after every match
 ganguli ne yah bhi kaha ki do baar team maalik se bachane ke liye unhone apana mobile bhi band kar diya, lekin team maalik sawaal−jawaab ke liye unhen pakad hi lete the

 com / guetl76xiwwhoever wishes you with HBD HBD HBD on your birthday, just note their names and on their anniversary wish them HA HA HA # virukagyaan Vidrani Mukherjee, daughter of Indrani and Peter Mukherjee, told the CBI that when she sought to contact Sheena Bora in April 2012, she received a reply with a new email ID named Sheena
 yah sibiai ke cese ko or majboot karti he ki april, 2012 main shina kii hatya karne or uske shav ko thikaane lagane ke baad uski maa indrani, uske naam se i-mail or text massej bheja karti thi
 After the investigation of the case came to the CBI, he recorded a statement of law
 usne yah bhi kaha tha ki vah jab bhi indrani se shina ke bare main puuchhati vah naaraaz ho jaati thi
 According to the law, Indrani tells her that Sheena has married a diamond merchant in the US
 vidhi ne ek bayaan main kaha, police ne mujhe or mere pita (peter) ko suchit kiya ki 24 april, 2012 ko shina bora kii hatya ho gai he or is sambandh main meri maa (indrani), driver shyaam raay or mere biological pita sanjeev khanna ke khilaaf maamla darj ho gaya he
 i contacted Sanjeev Khanna and asked him about the murder and his involvement in that crime
 unhone ise bahut halke main liya or kaha 'ha ha ha' or phone kaat diya
 The comments vidhi ne sibiai ko bataaya, 'varsh 2009 main, shina hamaare saath mumbai main rahane lagi
 Then she was introduced to me as my mother's sister
 tabhi mujhe pataa chalaa ki shina or rahul (peter mukherjee kii pehali shaadi se uskaa betaa) ke bich prem sambandh he
 Due to this, there used to be a lot of quarrels between Peter and Indrani
 meri maa rahul ko pasand nahin karti he
 Vidhi said, between 2009-10, i came to know that Sheena is my mother's daughter, as Rahul told my father Peter
 maine apni maa se poocha or usne chillaate hue kaha ki rahul jhooth bol rahaa he or chahta he ki uske pita peter unhen (indrani) ko talaak de den
 This further strengthens the cbi's case that her mother Indrani, after killing Sheena in April 2012 and locating her body, used to send e-mail and text messages in her name
 maamle kii jaanch sibiai ke paas aane ke baad usne vidhi kaa bayaan darj kiya tha
 She also said that she used to get angry whenever she asked Indrani about Sheena
 vidhi ke anusaar, indrani ne use bataaya ki shina ne america ke kisi hira vyapaaree se vivaah kar liya he
 Vidhi said in a statement, the police informed me and my father (peter) that Sheena Bora was killed on April 24, 2012, and in this regard my mother (indrani), driver Shyam Rai and my biological father Sanjeev a case has been registered against Khanna
 maine sanjeev khanna se sampark kiya or hatya tathaa us aparaadh main unki sanliptata ke bare main poocha
 He took it very lightly and said 'ha ha ha' and disconnected the phone
 tippaniyan Vidhi told the CBI, 'in the year 2009, Sheena started living with us in Mumbai
 phir use mujhe, meri maa kii bahan ke rup main milwaaya gaya
 Then i came to know that Sheena and Rahul (her son from Peter Mukherjee's first marriage) have a love affair
 iske kaaran peter or indrani main bahut jhagade hua karte the
 My mother does not like Rahul
 vidhi ne kaha, varsh 2009-10 ke bich, mujhe pataa chalaa ki shina meri maa kii beti he, jaisaa ki rahul ne mere pita peter ko bataaya tha
 i asked my mother and she shouted that Rahul is lying and wants his father Peter to divorce them (indrani)

 On the petition seeking to place Marital Rape in the crime category, the Center has told the High Court that the government is not in favor of amending Section 375
 centre ne kaha he ki lau kamishan bhi iske paksh me nahin he
 In the affidavit given in the Delhi High Court, the Central Government has said that it is clear from the 84th report of the Law Commission that if a husband has sex with his wife below the age of 15, then he can be placed in the category of Marital Rape
 haalanki supreme court me is umr ko 15 se badhaakar 18 saal karne ko lekar lagaai gai yachika par sunwaayee chal rahi he
 On the previous hearing, the High Court while hearing the petition had asked the petitioner to clarify its position in which the petitioner alleged that the amendment made in 2013 in section 375 (rape) of the IPC is wrong and it is a section of the Indian Penal Code
 377 (unnatural relations) does not match
 yachika main yah aarope lagaate hue ek kanoonee mudda uthaaya gaya he ki IPC ke donon dand praavdhaanon main anischitata he kyonki IPC kii dhara 375 main ek apwaad he ki kisi purush dwaara apni patni, jisaki umr 15 saal se kam na ho ke saath yon sambandh yaa yon gatividhiyaan balaatkaar nahin he
 Wife had filed a case of having unnatural sex
 The petitioner has asked the court to eliminate the legal uncertainties that are violating the respective rights of husband and wife
 yachikakarta apni patni kii shikaayat par aprakritik sex ke kathith aparaadh ke liye mukademe kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 The man married a 20-year-old girl in 2013, who later filed a case against him for the alleged offense of rape and unnatural sex

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi, playing a big bet before the Lok Sabha elections, has announced to ensure a minimum income for the poorest 20 per cent of the country
 is yojana kaa naam 'nyaay' rakhaa gaya he jiske tahat desh ke sabase garib 5 karod pariwaron ko 72000 rupee salanaa die jane kii ghoshnaa kii gai he
 In this sense, 3 on this plan
 60 lakh karod rupee kharch hone kaa anumaan he
 After this announcement by the Congress, there has been a debate about where such a huge amount of money will come from to run this scheme and how will it affect the economy of the country? Commenting on the announcement of the Congress, NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar said, " In 2008, the then Finance Minister P
W
 chindbaram vittiya ghate ko 2
 Taken from 5 per cent to 6 per cent
 yah ghoshnaa usee pattern par aage badhane jaisaa he
 Rahul Gandhi made the announcement without worrying about its impact on the economy
 agar yah skim lagu hoti he to ham chaar kadam or peeche chale jaaenge
 However, the Congress party says that the plan will be budget neutral (budget neutral is the concept in which a plan does not have an impact on the budget) and will be designed keeping in mind the fiscal deficit
 jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main professor or vikaas arthshaastri, jayati ghosh kaa kahana he ki 'nyaay' yojana ke bajet neutral hone kaa abhipraay he ki anya yojanaon main se katautee kar is yojana ko fund kiya jayega
 So the first question is that Congress should clarify which schemes it is going to cut
 The second biggest hurdle is to find out what your income is, because people will start hiding their income as soon as they know about the scheme
 teesri chunauti yah he ki jab bina kaam kiye ko paise milane lagenge to log kaam hi kyon karenge? chauthaa yah ki jo paisa sarkaar degi use behatar tareeke se kaise kharch kiya jaae? paanchvaan yah ki yojana ke liye paisa kahaan se aayega?professor jayati ghosh kahati hai ki behatar hota ki congress party saarvajanik sevaayen-swasthya, shiksha, poshan ityadi jaisi suvidhaayen sabake liye sulabh karne kii baat karti
 Along with this, they promised employment guarantee to rural and urban adults and gave pension to those who could not work due to any reasons

 On the question of the impact of the justice scheme on the economy of the country, Professor Arun Kumar says that the purchasing power of the people will increase due to the implementation of this scheme, due to which a little inflation can also increase

 But experts also believe that such schemes will also have to be cautious because there is no such model in the world where such schemes like minimum income are being run on such a large scale

 Perhaps the extent of the inferiority was reached when Digvijay Singh made a rude comment that the families of influential people should be kept away from the debate on corruption

 His name was Feroze Gandhi and the country's most influential ruling family is using this surname
 firoz jis samay indira ke pati or saansad the, us vakt nehru kii shakti nirvivaad thi
 Feroze, encouraged by the beautiful smile of his wife and thinking that the Prime Minister has a son-in-law, so nothing will happen, did not make any such purchase and purchase of land to become rich, which makes his hands dirty
 iske ulat unhone bataur saansad nehru sarkaar ke kaarykaal main ek bade vittiya ghotaale kaa pardaafash kiya tha

 Taapsee said "I remember that one day before the shoot i was explaining myself that i have to be normal in front of such a veteran actor
 " abhinetri ne kaha, "bhagya se agali subah meraa amitabh ke saath drishy kaaphi saamaanya tha
 However, for me this simple scene became the most difficult scene of the film
 " Taapsee said that this role was quite challenging for her, as she had to play a 'traumatized sexually violet' girl in it
 unhone kaha ki shuru se hi film ke sah-nirmaataa shoojit or nirdeshak aniruddh ne is baat ko saaf kar diya tha ki unka kirdaar aansu nahin bahaayega, phir chaahe unhen kisi bhi hinsa yaa pareshaani se guzarana pade

 He stated "the effect of depicting emotions was quite different, at least in form
 bhartiya cinema main hamen bhaawanaaon ko apane bas main nahin rakhana hota

 " taapasi kaa yah bhi kahana he ki is film main unhone pehali baar kisi bhi prakaar ke mechap kaa istemaal nahin kiya or unhen kaaphi acha laga
 She considers the dressing done by the girls to look good on camera
 vah apane asal jivan main mechap kaa bilkul bhi istemaal nahin karatin
 They do not even know to apply eye liner on their eyes
 unka kahana he ki kai prakaar se 'pink' main nibhaayaa gaya kirdaar unke asal jivan ke kaaphi kareeb he
 However, he did not face any such thing
 tippaniyan Talking about the possibility of getting the award for the character played in 'pink', Taapsee said that people had expressed similar hope after 'baby'
 taapasi ko us varsh maar-dhaad vaali filmon kii shrenee main bhi nahin namit kiya gaya tha

 ) taapasi ne kaha "mujhe yaad he ki shoot se ek din pehle main apane aapako is baat ke liye samajha rahi thi ki mujhe aise diggaj abhinayta ke saamne saamaanya rahanaa he
 The actress said, "the next morning with Bhagya, the scene with Amitabh was quite normal
 haalanki mere liye yah saamaanya sa drishy film kaa sabase mushkil drishy ban gaya
 " taapasi ne kaha ki unke liye yah kirdaar kaaphi chunauteepurn tha, kyonki unhen isamen ek 'tromatiped sexuali wailated' ladki kaa kirdaar nibhaana tha
 He said that from the beginning, the film's co-producer Shoojit and director Anirudh had made it clear that his character would not shed tears, even if he had to go through any violence or trouble
 adaalat main nyaayadhish ke faisla sunaane ke baad bhi is kirdaar ko nahin ronaa tha
 Tapasi tried to play this character optimally, overcoming her feelings
 unhone kaha "kam se kam rup main bhaawanaaon ko darshane kaa prabhaav kaaphi alag tha
 We do not have to keep emotions in Indian cinema
 ise jitna ho sake, darshana hota he
 During the shoot of 'pink', i realized that more and more things have to be controlled
 " Taapsee also says that for the first time in this film she did not use any type of makeup and she liked it very much
 camere main acha dikhne ke liye ladakiyon dwaara kii jane vaali saaj-sajja ko vah bhaar maanati hai
 She does not use makeup in her real life at all
 unhen apni ankhon par ai-liner bhi lagaana nahin aata
 He says that in many ways the character played in 'pink' is very close to his real life
 haalanki unhen is prakaar kii kisi bhi cheez kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 The comments 'pink' main nibhaae kirdaar ke liye puraskaar milane kii sambhaavna ke bare main taapasi ne kaha ki logon ne 'baby' film ke baad bhi isi prakaar kii aashaa jataai thi
 Taapsee was also not named in the category of films that year

 It is also new and according to New India
 mukhya chunaav ayukta vahaan kisi party sachiv ke saath baithkar press conference kii timming tay kar lenge
 The country's time will also not be wasted
 ayog khud ko bhaajapa kaa chunaav prabharee bhi ghoshit kar de

 If you want to speak something then what goes in speaking

 By-elections were being held in Kairana, UP
 aachaar samhita lagu thi
 The Commission allowed the Prime Minister to conduct road shows
 na jane kitne sarkari camere lagaakar us road sho kaa kawarej kiya gaya
 There is already doubt about EVM machine
 aaj ek raily ke liye ayog ne press conference kaa samay badha kar khud ishaara kar diya he ki ham ab bharose ke qaabil nahin rahe, bharosa mat karo
 If the people sitting on the post like Chief Election Commissioner, will reduce the credibility of the institutions in this way, then what will be left in this country? The comments isliye behatar he chunaav ayukta bench kursi lekar bijepi ke nae daphtar main chale jaaen
