 ye virodh itnaa zyada he ki legal notice se lekar, putala foonkane tak madhur bhandarkar ko kaaphi virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Sanjay Gandhi's 'daughter' raised questions on 'indu Sarkar', said it is false that the film Madhur has also been accused that he is a supporter of Modi, so the film is getting bjp's support to answer the opposition

 On Thursday, after consulting with all allies, the Congress made it clear that Prime Minister Monmohan Singh is not involved in the race for the presidency and he will definitely remain Prime Minister till 2014
 gauratlab he ki ek din pehle buudhvaar ko trinmul congress netaa mamata banerjee or sapa netaa mulaayam singh yadav ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa naam raashtrapati pad ke liye sujhakar desh kii raajnneeti main bhuuchaal laa diya tha
 Apart from Manmohan Singh, Mamta had suggested the names of Somnath Chatterjee and APJ Kalam for the post of President
 kalam ko mamata ne apni pehali pasand bataaya tha
 Now on Thursday, Congress spokesperson Janardan Dwivedi made it clear to Mamata in gestures that the party is yet to decide a name for the presidency and the Prime Minister is out of the race
 unhone kaha ki congress kalam or somnath chatarji ke naam ko asweekaar karti he
 He also said that the party will soon decide a single name for this supreme post of the country

 Recently, the fisheries industry minister Purushottam Solanki was somehow persuaded, so now there are reports of some other mlas getting angry about not making a minister
 sutron kaa kahana he ki 14 janvari ke baad rajya main mantrimandal vistaar kiya ja saktaa he
 CM Rupani himself spoke to the angry Purushottam Solanki and assured him to resolve the issue after January 14
 solanki ne cabinet rank yaa atirikt mantralay maange hai
 One of these two demands can be met

 Finally, the party president Amit Shah called him and he was persuaded by giving the finance department
 isse pehle vitt vibhaag saurabh patel ko diya gaya tha
 But, to solve the political crisis, this department was taken from him and given to Nitin
 sutron ke mutabik ab bijepi ke chaar vidhayak naaraaz hai
 He wants a ministerial position in the government
 inamen se ek hai panchamahal ke vidhayak jetha bharwar
 Jetha Bharwad has been winning elections for the last 5 terms from Panchamahal's city
 unka kahana he ki ab ve aage chunaav nahi ladanaa chaahate hai or ve party ke kaaryakarta bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 But there is a demand from the people of his area that he be made a minister
 haalanki, unhone aupchaarik rup se party se koi maang nahi kii he
 Jetha Bharwad told Aaj Tak, 'people of my region demand that i be made a minister, but i have been associated with BJP for years, i have no such demand

 In such a situation, expansion of the cabinet after January 14 is possible
 gauratlab he ki rajya main 27 mantri ho sakate hai, lekin philhal mahaj 20 hi mantri hai
 Thus, 7 places are still vacant in the cabinet

 If the traders are upset with the sealing drive of the Monitoring Committee set up by the Supreme Court, then the same leaders do not understand anything
 supreme court ke faisle ke khilaaf koi nahin janaa chahta or kaarobaariyon ke saath khud ko khadaa dikhaane kii bhi majaburi he
 The Monitoring Committee also conducted a sealing drive in South Delhi, where more than 40 properties were sealed
 darasal ceiling sirf un property kii ja rahi he jo basament main hai yaa phir pehali or duusari floor par hai
 Businessmen allege that the settlement, which is not being used by the vocational, is also being sealed
 kuch vyapaariyon ne bataaya ki unhone kanvarjan charge jamaa kara diya he, baavjood iske ceiling jari he
 On one hand, where demonetisation and GST have broken the back of businessmen, now their difficulties have increased due to sealing
 kaarobaariyon kii shikaayat he ki jis property ko 2014 main kharida he usapar 10 saal pehle kaa bhi kanvarjan charge maanga ja rahaa he, jab dukaan 2014 main lee gai to 10 saal kaa kanvarjan kyon die jaae
 The trouble of businessmen has increased with the fact that there is no one to listen to them before the Supreme Order
 aadesh ke khilaaf koi netaa bolnaa nahin chahta or nigam parshad, vidhayak se lekar saansad tak is maamle main kaarobaariyon ke saath to hai lekin iskekhilaaf bolaneco taiyaar nahin
 In Delhi, the ruling Aam Aadmi Party and the bjp-congress sitting in opposition are accusing each other, but what is the solution, it is beyond anyone's understanding
 vahi monitering cameti ne saaf kiya he ki 26 janvari ke baad ceiling kii karrwai main or teji laaenge kyonki suraksha kaarnon se police kii uplabdhta kam he lekin uske baavjood kuch ilaakon main ceiling kii karrwai jari he
 He said, 'the secrecy was so kept in the campaign, that even the surrounding units were not aware of it
 unhone bataaya, 'hamane apni aasapaas kii ikaayiyon ko bhi iske bare main nahin bataaya tha
 In such campaigns, sudden attack is most important
 aap jab vahaan pahunchen to chupchaap baithkar sahi samay kaa intjaar karen
 There were three goals in front of us

 ) pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bricks kii baithak main bhaag lene ke liye china jane se thik pehle pichley do maheene se chal rahe doklam vivaad par purna viraam lag gaya he
 The armies of India and China decided to gradually withdraw their troops from the disputed territory
 to ab donon desh kii taraf se tikhi bayaanbaji bhi ruki he
 The relentless retreat of China, which has been continuously giving rise to war, is not only a big win for PM Modi, but also a big defeat for China
 inpar ek najar daalate hai
 Damage to China - 1
 vaishvik str par chhavi ko pahunchaa nuksabgar doklam vivaad par bharat ko phayda hua he to china ko nuksaan bhi kaaphi hua he
 The image of China preparing to make itself a global leader has received a big blemish
 2
 Allies were less critical, but very few countries had justified China on the issue of Doklam, rather many countries appeared in support of India
 kai deshon ne to china kii kadi ninda bhi kii
 It is clear that the Doklam dispute has pitted many countries against China
 3
 India's preparations on the border become stronger One of the reasons for China's retreat on the Handoklam dispute is that the Indian Army is in a very strong position at that place
 iske alaava bharat ne LAC se sate puure ilaake main apni sena kii kilabandi kar lee
 Ladakh, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh, everywhere the Indian Army has increased its strength
 4
 Questioning Jinping's credibility in the politics inside China, Jinping was preparing for his second term as President with a reputation for India
 kyonki agar vah is mudde par bharat ko jhukaa pate to apni party main unki daavedaari or bhi majboot hoti
 But maybe now it can be difficult
 5
 Balichen has consistently raised questions about India's claim to the Security Council
 bharat lagaataar sanyukt raashtra kii suraksha parishad main apni pakki jagah ke liye daavedaari kar rahaa he
 But he has not been able to succeed
 doklam vivaad par kade rukh ke saath-saath barte gaye sanyam ne puri duniya main bharat kii saakh ko majboot kiya he
 Many countries of the world have also supported India on the issue of Doklam
 doklam vivaad par china kii nahin gai akad, bharat ko di 'sabak seekhney' kii naseehatmodi kii sabase badi jeet -1
 After the surgical strike, the biggest step on the military fronts till now was the biggest achievement of the Modi government was the surgical strike made in Pakistan
 lekin china jaise bade desh ke saamne bhartiya sena ne apana dam dikhaaya
 That too in two ways, one is that the Indian Army did not step back from Doklam and secondly, our army did not come to China’s Kawe
 rakshaamantri arun jetali ne bhi china ko jawaab dete hue kaha tha ki bharat ab 1962 vaala bharat nahin he
 Its effect was seen on the border also, whether it is Doklam or Ladakh
 2
 With the victory, foreign policy came into effect after coming to government in 2014, PM Modi completely changed the foreign policy framework
 har desh ke netaa ke saath personal relation ke saath hi sabhi deshon ko apane haq main karnaa
 Modi also called Chinese President Xi Jinping for India, but his betrayal raised many questions about his policy
 par ab china kaa doklam se peeche hatana yah dikhaata he ki modi kii videsh niti ek baar phir rang laai he or yah ek badi jeet kii tarah hi he
 Apart from this, foreign policy is also being tightened on Pakistan, which is becoming a friend of China
 america lagaataar pakistan par rukh apana rahaa he, jo ki uske liye achche sanket nahin he
 3
 china jaise majboot desh ke saamne datane se padosi deshon ke bich badhegi saakhchin lagaataar bharat ke padosi desh jaise nepal, bhutan, bangladesh jaise deshon ko apane haq main karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 But India constantly reminded that India is their true friend
 ab jab china jaise bade desh ko bharat ne takkar di he, to lajimi he ki in deshon kaa bharat ke prati vishwaas badhegaa
 4
 china ko khatre ke rup main dekhne vaale deshon ke bich bharat majbootbharat ke alaava aise kai desh hai jo ki china kii vistaar niti se kaaphi pareshaan hai
 Many countries including Bhutan, Vietnam, Japan have been continuously opposing this attitude of China
 ab jin bhi deshon ko china se aapatti he, unka saath bhi bharat ke saath aa saktaa he
 Japan had already openly supported India on the Doklam issue
 inke alaava america, australia ne bhi bharat kaa saath diya

 to lose myself in the hills, the forest, where you hear the birds singing and the woods whispering, the lake dancing as the cool breeze swishes, the stunning rainbow, the rainfall, the colorful play of clouds, the magnetic energy of the sunrising and the ambience created by the romantic moonlight amongst the cluster of stars
 
 
 
 
 
 
 in solitude and away from the city, away from everything and everyone
 Over a period of time i have realized that taking time completely to self clears and recharges your energy
 We all know that fasting from food is beneficial to our physical health
 But fasting from people is equally beneficial to your mental, emotional and spiritual health
 Fasting from certain people can also help you realise who is draining or depleting your energy
 Being in solitude helps you to strengthen your energy field and intuition and you develop a strong personal relationship with yourself
 Focus on clearing and healing your own energies by meditating or taking a hike by yourself in the forest or whatever it is that you like doing alone
 i meditate daily and love isolating myself in nature which is even more beneficial because of the healing energy the Earth provides for us

 Science of slow deep breathing
 There is robust scientific evidence for the benefits of mindful breathing
 Shallow breathing limits the diaphragms range of motion
 The lowest part of the lung does not get a full share of oxygenated air
 That can make you feel short of breath and anxious
 Deep abdominal breathing encourages full oxygen exchange, that is, the beneficial of incoming oxygen for outgoing carbon dioxide
 Not surprisingly it can slow the heartbeat and lower or stabilise blood pressure
 So the next time someone tells you to take a deep breath, smile, breathe deep and heed their wise advice as it instantly changes your state of mind and makes you feel happy

 Vajpayee died on August 16 but his condition was deteriorating from August 12-13

 isliye (iske baad) pradhanmantri ne nirbhay hokar swatantraaa diwas manaaya
 Raut wrote, Prime Minister Modi made several announcements for the poor in his Independence Day address
 unke bhaashana kii style aisi thi ki purvavarti sarkaron ne kuch nahin kiya,isliye swatantraaa (ab tak) bekaar thi
 The Shiv Sena leader said, it is true that welfare schemes run with tax money that honest people pay

 hamaare main isamen ek se dedh pratishat or jodne kii kshamta he
 There is still scope ham is str tak pahunch paaenge
 On GST, Jaitley said that the good news is that there is consensus in all the states and political parties other than one are in favor of it
 unhone kaha ki kshobh kii baat yah he jis party ne jiesti kaa masauda banaaya he vahi is par sahamat nahin ho rahi he
 Jaitley, however, said that the figure in Rajya Sabha will be favorable soon and i hope that GST will be passed

 Also it will affect the consumption capacity of the rural economy

 Regarding the strength of India, Jaitley said that India has a large population which the world cannot ignore

 He stressed that the reform process has an important role for states
 ‘ham sahakaari sanghavaad kii baat karte hai, lekin mujhe yah dekhakar khushi he ki rajya ab nivesh aakarshith karne ke liye ek-duusare se pratispardhaa kar rahe hai

 We were expecting a growth of eight per cent, but the monsoon has not been enough, which will cause a decline in agricultural production

 par jaanane vaale kehete hai ki bachapan main kai baar sir ke bal girane ke kaaran ek roj unhen goomad ke saath 'secularapa' bhi ho gaya
 Sekularapa was so fierce that if his son himself believed, then this time 27 riots had taken place within eight months of his formation

 Few people have so much jigra who can dance with the whole secularism on the corpse of every religion

 Then, in the grief of breaking alliance with Congress and losing election to BJP, he formed Samajwadi Party and contested again by alliance with 'bahujan Samaj Party' named like his half-sister and then became Chief Minister with the help of congress-janata Dal
 iske baad wo desh ke raksha mantri bane, phir bijepi kii 'chupake se di pondi-paiyya' se mukhyamantri ban gaye
 Then he continued to support the Congress from inside and outside till 2014 at the Center
 phir tisare morche ke pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar bhi ban baithe

 My father used to make sure that i slept with him, only in my underwear
 vah kehete the ki yah ventilation ke liye acha he
 i was born in Chennai at a place called Adayar
 mere pita bijnesaman the, maa teacher thim
 My mother left the job after i was born

 He often lived outside in connection with work
 teen saal kii umr main maa kaa dehanth ho gaya
 Then grandmother raised me
 11 saal kii umr main vah bhi duniya chhod gayi
 i was the only child, so relatives advised me to send her to a boarding school
 maine manaa kar diya
 i was afraid of being alone
 mere pita chaahate the ki main hameshaa unheen ke kamare main soun
 He wanted to put me to sleep, in his underwear
 mujhe kabhi tii-shart yaa top nahin pahanane diya jaataa
 Every night his hands were on my body
 jab main puuchhati ki aap kya kar rahe the, to vah kehete ki bas dekh rahe the ki main so gai yaa nahin
 He used to threaten that if i didn't sleep, he would send me to boarding school
 puberty ke baad jab mere vaksh ubharne lage to mujhe khule vakshon main papa ke saath sone main shame aane lagi
 i remember once i went to my father's ancestral village for a wedding
 vahaan kuch mahilaayein yah dekhakar chaunk gai thim ki 14 saal kii umr main bhi main bra nahin pahenti
 One of my aunts shouted at me
 unhone mujhe mere pehle antarvastr die, jisamen baniyaan bhi thi
 i was also surprised to see all my cousins sleeping in clothes
 ghar pahunchakar maine papa ko is bare main bataaya to unhone boarding skool bhejne kii dhamkee dekar chup kara diya
 As a child, i was very fond of working on Microsoft Paint
 12 saal kii umr main papa ne mujhe computer kaa password bataa diya
 But at the same time it was also conditioned that i should use the computer in his presence
 jab main skirt yaa goun pahenti thi to vah use jatke se utarkar mujhe apni god main baitha lete the
 i hated it
 dheer-dhire mujhe painting se bhi nafrat ho gai
 i did not realize that he was sexually harassing me
 mujhe hameshaa lagata rahaa ki mere papa jo kuch kar rahe the vah 'normal' baat he
 i got irritated from being at home
 darasal mere sabase achche din tab aae jab ghar main koi shaadi thi
 There were many relatives at home and i received a lot of gifts
 do maheenon tak main alag soi
 But as soon as those people left, i had to sleep with them again
 maine kai baar papa se kaha ki vah apane kapade pahanakar soen, par vah sidhe manaa kar dete the
 Even during my menstruation, i was not allowed to wear any extra clothes
 main apane doston ke saath jaakar antarvastr kharidti thi lekin ek baar mere saare paise khatm ho gaye
 When Papa came to know, he promised to get me new underwear
 ek raat unhone kaha ki main sirf antarvastr pahanuun taaki vah meri 'fitness' check kar saken
 They started touching me
 us raat maine virodh kiya
 i said that i would not sleep with them like this half-naked
 maine kah diya ki main boarding skool jane ko taiyaar hum
 When i was in class X, we were taken on a school tour
 main raahat mahasoos kar rahi thi kyonki main ghar se dur thi
 My father did not allow me, but i borrowed money and went on tour
 iske baad papa ne skool main bahut hangaamaa kiya
 He was drunk
 unhone mere utpeedan kii koshish kii
 When i protested, he took off his belt and started beating me and eventually did what he wanted to do
 main ghayal thi
 My lower abdomen was threatening with pain
 main thik se chal bhi nahin paa rahi thi
 He sent a message to the school that i would not be able to continue my studies
 maine kuch rishtedaaron se baat kii or unhen ve ghaav dikhaae jo belt se meri peeth par bane the
 The truth is that i did not know with whom and how i should share all this
 iske baad mujhe boarding skool bhej diya gaya

 i never felt that my own father was trying to have sex with me
 mere pita kaa naam stanley jaisan arvind he
 i stayed in hostel till 12th standard
 main chhuttiyon main bhi ghar nahin janaa chaahati thi
 Hostel was the best time of my life, because during this time my father did not visit me even once
 mere pita hostal landline par phone karke mujhase ghar lautne ko kehete or fees na dene kii dhamkee dete
 Once i said that first i want to discuss this with my mother's relatives
 unhone phone kaat diya
 He was probably afraid that i would open his pole
 kai chetavanee bhari chitthiyon ke baad bhi meri fees bhar di jaati
 But i did not get any pocket money
 is vajah se main kisi tour par nahin ja paati thi
 When a relative came to see me, he would give 200-300 rupees
 wo paise sirf sainitory napkins kharidne main kharch ho jate the
 During this time i had only one close friend, Sirisha Venkataraman
 vah akasar mujhe udhaar diya karti thi
 In class 11, i had only two sets of bra and underwear, which i used to change at intervals of one day
 puraane hone kii vajah se unamem chhed ho gaye the
 i did not go home during the holidays and go to Siri's house
 vah bhi ekaadh baar apane papa ke paas so jaati thi, par is dauraan uske saath kuch bura yaa ganda nahin hota tha
 His father was a very good man
 hameshaa use hansaate rahete, uske saath dance karte
 i could not understand why my father is not like this
 mujhe yaad he ek baar maine papa ko chitthee likhakar poocha tha ki aapaki problem kya he
 
 
 After the 12th class, i spent my holidays at my mother's relatives
 yah tamilnadu ke dakshini hisse main or chennai se dur tha
 He had some problems with my father, so he did not talk to them and did not even come and go home
 unhone hi chennai ke athiraj college main sarkari cote se daakhila lene main meri madad kii
 i could not pay my fees
 main event management companiyon main host / pramotor kii job karne lagi
 Siri would often accompany me
 vah tom boy sareekhee thi, vah mujhe bodyguard jaisaa feel karaati thi
 My father is a real evil
 mere dimag ne kaha ki mujhe police main unki shikaayat kerani chahie
 But i was afraid that he would come out later and torture me
 saath hi mere paas unke khilaaf koi saboot bhi nahin tha
 Nobody was on my side
 bible main ek kahawat he ki buraai se hameshaa dur rahanaa chahie
 i was doing the same
 college admician ke dauraan main apane pita se sirf ek baar mili, uske baad main unase milane se bachati rahi
 While he was doing all this with me, i did not know that i could send him to jail for this act
 main ab bhi unhen sajaa dilvaanaa chaahati hum
 i did my MBA with Siri from Rai Business School
 mujhe project or asinament puraa karne ke liye or paise kii jarurat thi
 Then i met Raju
 vah classmet tha or siri kaa dost tha
 i considered him my brother
 event company main bhi kaam dilwakar usne meri madad kii thi
 He had also paid my second semester fees
 raju mere paas aata tha or kahata tha ki main usase kuch bhi share kar saktaa hum
 One day she asked why i take Siri everywhere
 maine use bataaya ki mujhe mardon se dar lagata he
 He asked the reason main chup rahi
 Next time he convinces me to tell him everything
 tum meri bahan jaisi ho, vah kaha karata tha
 When i told him the disgusting details of my life, he said that everything is fine and i need not worry
 usne kaha ki kabhi main akelaa feel karun to use kabhi bhi kol kar sakati hum
 That he will always be present for me
 kuch din baad usne bataaya ki use ek dulhan kii meden seremani ke liye emasi kii jarurat he
 He said that i do not tell Siri about this and during this time he will take full care of my safety
 jab vah mujhe lene hostal aayaa to vah thodi pie hue tha
 i did not panic because i considered him a brother
 usne mujhe bag diya or vah dress pahanane ko kaha jo vah event ke liye laayaa tha
 It was a short skirt
 maine ise pahanane se manaa kar diya kyonki mere paas stocking nahin the
 He said, no problem
 jab ham club pahunche, vahaan baari bheed thi
 The party was in full swing
 maine poocha ki mujhe kab stage par janaa hoga
 He said, 'in two hours'
 main yah sochakar thodaa ghabaraai ki lautate hue kaaphi der ho jaaegi
 i also expressed my discomfort with the dress
 vah gussa ho rahaa tha
 After this he gave me a drink saying 'welcome drink'
 yah swaad main ajeeb nahin tha, main use pi gai
 He gave me another drink
 maine jaise hi ek ghunt liya, puraa club ghoomane laga
 i told Raju that my health is not good and he should leave me home
 main sidhe chal bhi nahin paa rahi thi, isliye raju ke kuch dost bhi hamaare saath aae
 i did not bother with this, because Raju was with me
 main aage kii seat par baithi or phir shaayad so gai
 i felt like i was flying
 mere liye apni ankhen khuli rakhana mushkil tha
 When i came to my senses, i found myself on the backseat of a car parked on the beach
 raju ne mujhe do jhannatedaar thappad lagaae or gaali dete hue chillaaya, 'tuune apane pita se sex kar liya, lekin meri dress pahanane se manaa kar diya
 i have paid your fee
 ' main 'sori anna' kahati hui gidgidaati rahi
 But he started taking off my jeans and tops and pressurizing his friends to please him 'in an oral way'
 usne kaha ki vah sirf tabhi mujhe ghar chhodega varanaa bina kapadon ke hi bich par chhod jayega
 But God was with me at that time
 jab vah meri genes utaar rahaa tha to genes main rakhe phone se apane aap siri kaa number lag gaya
 His number was in my speed dial list
 usne raju kii sari baaten sun leen
 By then Raju's friends had taken off my underwear and were trying to force me
 siri ne raju ko phone karke dhamkaaya
 Perhaps he was afraid of her call
 usne apane doston ko peeche hataaya, mujhe kapade lautaae or mujhe siri kii ek kareebi dost ke yahaan chhodkar chalaa gaya
 i did not go to college for a week
 main ja hi nahin pai
 Siri tried hard to normalize me
 yahaan tak ki uske pita bhi mujhase milane aae
 One night when we woke up, we received a shocking news that Raju's car had a tremendous accident on the way to Pondicherry
 mujhe laga jaise ishwar ne use sajaa di he
 i am afraid to travel with men in the lift
 jab bhi main taxi main hoti hum to kisi ko bhi phone laga leti hum taaki driver ko lage ki main kisi se baat kar rahi hum
 i become a stone in the dark
 andhere main hi kahin mujhamen yah baat ghar kar gai thi ki mere pita ne meraa rape kiya he
 After college, i found work in an event management company
 mujhe ab bhi mardon se dikkat he
 i remember whenever i used to go to college, i would scream every time
 ab bijli jaati he to main paaglon kii tarah apana phone khojane lagati hum
 Whenever a man comes close to me, it seems that he is going to touch me in a wrong way
 main jaanboojhkar bheed-bhaad vaali jagahon, bason, mal or trainon se bachati hum
 My travel expenses are high because i only drive in auto and taxi
 jab bhi kabhi 'college sex' par baat hoti he to main chidh jaati hum
 How many times have i not recruited a male colleague due to one of my minor doubts? shaayad mujhe apane beete hue kal se peechha chhudaane ke liye ek manovaigyanik kii jarurat he
 At first i was afraid to go out
 main thik se so nahin paati thi or neend kii goliyaan lene lagi
 Even tried to kill himself
 siri sach main ek farista thi, jisane mujhe bachaaya
 She is now married and lives in the US
 ham mail or skip par baat karte rahete hai
 i have suffered the consequences of sharing my past yesterday with a person and am so ashamed of it that i am not ready to share it with anyone else
 main hameshaa khud se yahi kaha karti hum
 There should be an international court with legal rules for women
 rape sirf ek bhartiya avadharana nahin he
 As NATO and UN courts hear war crimes, what about crimes against women? What is the crime that we face everyday? You know when i read the statement of Nirbhaya's convict in the newspapers, i wanted to kill him
 ek din mukesh jarur yah mahasoos karegaa ki koi bhi mahila soft target ho sakati he
 Mothers should teach their sons how to respect women
 maine swimming instractor kii talash main google kiya, lekin naakaam rahi
 Then i learned swimming on my own by landing in a four-foot pool
 yah zyada surakshit tha, aisa mujhe lagata he
 There are a lot of rehabilitation centers for drug addicts, but not for rape victims? This is something that - if you have precious gems, they are not safe
 aap use andar-baahar, har jagah sambhalakar rakhen
 Place it in a concrete box, yet it will remain a danger
 mahilaayein beshkeemtee hai
 His body too
 unki aatma bhi
 His identity is always in crisis

 jo maine aapse share kiya vah repiston kii maansikta nahin badalegaa, par shaayad jaagrukta failaae
 Three months ago i met a woman in Hyderabad on a bus who shared her story with me

 He said that if the people of Chhattisgarh had not given 10 years to Dr
 Raman Singh, today the situation in Chhattisgarh would have been different
 agar luteron ke haath main chhattisgarh chalaa gaya hota, to yahaan kuch nahin bachataa
 Not only this, not even a kilo of coal remains
 congress kaa panja yahaan padataa to 10 saal main chhattisgarh tabah ho jaataa
 Giving the example of Uttarakhand and Jharkhand, Modi said that these two went backward after the formation of the state, but after the formation of Chhattisgarh, there is continuous development here
 uttarakhand main sarkarein badalati rahi, baar-baar congress ko mauka miltaa rahaa isliye uski sthiti aisi ho gai he
 Jharkhand is falling in spite of such a large natural property, Chhattisgarh survived because you trusted Raman Singh and this trust paid off
 modi ne kaha ki jati, birdari ke liye vot na den, vikaas ke liye vot den
 Vote for the development of Chhattisgarh to continue the development process and take it to a new height
 desh vikaas chahta he
 Modi jokingly said that now people are opening locker to keep coal and onion
 centre kii sarkaar ne garib se pyaaj ko bhi chin liya he
 The Congress had promised that if its government is formed in Delhi, it will reduce inflation in 100 days, but inflation has not come down
 unhone vaadakhilaphi kii
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee would not have built Chhattisgarh, had Raman Singh's government not been able to dream of building Bastar University
 aaj bastar main uniwarsity he
 Modi said that the Raman government implemented the food security bill and in Chhattisgarh, he is famous by the name of rice wala baba
 modi ne kaha ki raman singh samvedansheel vyakti he
 He admitted his lapse on the Naxalite attack
 naksali hamale main maare gaye netaaon ke pariwaron se milane gaye
 Attacking Nitish, he said that on the other hand, after the Patna blasts, do not confess the mistake
 na hi vahaan kii sarkaar in dhamaakon ke prati gambhir nahin dikhi
 He said that Chhattisgarh will overtake Gujarat in terms of development
 yah mere liye garv kii baat hogi
 Disappointed with the slow progress of finding a permanent solution on the issue of food security, India today said it would be difficult for it to agree on a trade facilitation agreement
 yah samjhauta mukhyataur par viksit deshon dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya he
 An official release said, "until we get an assurance and see nothing that gives developing countries confidence that (WTO) member countries are in Bali for public storage of foodgrains and especially underdeveloped countries
" According to the promises made, we are committed to finding a permanent solution, till then it will be difficult for India to agree on the amendment agreement
 ’is maheene ke shuru main geneva main bharat ne kaha ki vah mul sanshodhan patr ke praaroop main vyapaar suvidha samjhaute (tiefee) ko puraa karne main hameshaa hi sakriyata or rachanaatmakataa ke saath judaa rahaa he or apni pratibiddhata ko puraa karne ke liye kaam karata rahaa he
 At the WTO meeting held in Bali in December last year, members agreed to finalize the TFA and find a permanent solution to the implementation of the Food Security Plan without any hindrance
 vahaan tay hua tha ki vahaan sahmati bani thi ki vikasshil deshon ke khaadya suraksha kaarykram (anaaj ke sarkari bhandar or nunatam samarthan mulya kaarykram) ke vishay main pakkaa samjhauta hone tak aise kaaryakramon kii jaanch par jor nahin diya jayega
 Significantly, under the World Trade Agreement, there is a provision of punitive duty against countries for agricultural subsidies going above one level

 Whereas, one round party's slogan was that bjp's three heritage Atal, Advani and Murali Manohar

 Where a few days ago, there was a dominance of white kurta-pajamas in the city of Nawabs, then there is a new trend - 'rang de tu mohe Gerua'
 yogi adityanathke netritv main bijepi sarkaar ke haathon main upi kii kaman aate hi satta kaa rang bhi gerua mana jane laga he
 In Lucknow too, ocher color has started appearing everywhere
 aam ho yaa khaas, har kisi kii jubaan par gerua he
 Some people may associate Gerua with the likes of Yogi Adityanath, but the reality is that the Nath community from which Yogis come from is not a tradition like Gerua
 isi parampara ke mutabik hi yogi adityanath nakh se shikha tak gerue vastra hi dhaaran karte hai
 Yogi Adityanath is the Peetadheeshwara of Gorkhannamath
 is padavi par rahane vaale ko maharaj ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 Every garment worn on their body is ocher
 yogi adityanath na sirf kurta gerua pahante hai balki unka dhotinuma nichalaa vastra (langota) bhi gerua hota he
 Apart from this, safa, wide shoulder strap, undergarments, socks worn on the feet are also ocher
 gerue kii isi mahima ko dekhte hue lakhanu main naukarshahi ne yogi adityanath ke aasapaas ke maahaul main zyada se zyada yahi rang bharne kii koshish kii he
 However, Yogi Adityanath had given only one order to the officers that a ocher-colored towel should remain on his chair
 lekin afasar to tehre afasar, unki koshish rahi ki lokabhawan main har taraf gerua dikhe
 The Chief Minister holds a cabinet meeting in Lok Bhavan itself
 press conference jab bhi hoti he manch par bich main yogi kii kursi hoti he jis par gerua tauliya rakhaa najar aata he
 If the Chief Minister does not come to the press conference, then this chair is removed
 lokabhawan kii lobby ko gerue rang ke kapade se sajaayaa gaya he
 The flowers on the main door are also saffron-colored, the pots are also painted in the same color
 bataate hai ki shuru me naukarshahi yogi ke aasapaas kii tamaam chizon ko bhagava rang main rangane main jute gai thi, lekin ab dhire dhire adhikari bhi samajhane lage hai ki rang se kahin zyada jaruri kaamkaaj ko behatar dhang se karke dikhaanaa he
 Yogi has a keen eye on his work and if he does not give results then it will be difficult for him
 gerua cegorakhpurka conection jaanane ke liye 'aaj tak' gorakshnath mandir bhi pahunchaa
 When i met Dwarka Tiwari, the office in-charge of the temple, he explained the importance of ocher color in the Nath sect
 dwarika tiwari ke mutabik yogi adityanath jo vastra pahante hai wo gandhi ashram se aate hai or unhen gerua rangavaaya jaataa he
 He told that in the Vaishnava sect everyone wears white clothes, similarly in the Nath sect it is necessary for everyone to wear uterus
 dwarika tiwari ne bataaya ki gerua pasand kaa sawaal nahin balki parampara he
 Yogi Kamal Nath Baba also threw light on the importance of Geru in the Gorakshanath temple
 gorakhpur karmasthali hone kii vajah se lambey samay se yahaan yogi adityanath or gerue rang kaa prabhaav rahaa he
 But now in Lucknow too, the magic of Gerua has started speaking
 iskaa saboot he lakhanu main dukaanon ke baahar tange gerua kurte
 Shopkeepers also say that the demand for ocher kurtas is increasing day by day

 Despite this, the policemen did not get to know about the dent in the security cordon of Nitish
 ek anjaan yuvak ko apane saamne dekhakaranitish kumarbhauchakke rah gaye or patna ke dm or espi ko ishaara kiya
 After this, Nitish's security personnel ran and picked the young man out of the venue
 iske baad yuvak santosh kumaar thakur se patna ke esaspi ne poochtacha kii
 In which it came to know that this young man is from Daniwa area and is the brother of a rape victim

 The film 'super Se Up' has played the lead roles, with Veer Das, Kirti Kulhari, Gulshan Grover, Deepak Dobriyal and Yashpal Sharma
 is film kii kahani gumti he, ranbir ke ird-gird, jinaki maa marane ke baad ek ghar chhod jaati he, par vasiyat unke naam nahin kar paati

 It is neither a comedy, nor a thriller nor perhaps the audience can understand the spirit of the story
 dialog behad kamjor hai
 There is no newness in the situation, although the actors in the film are all intentions, but no one is able to leave their mark through their character
 vir das apane kirdaar ke saath nyaay karte hai
 Deepak Dobriyal has passion, but his character succumbs due to weak lines

 The songs of the film are good, but not much will be seen in the film

 lalu yadav ke kareebi rahe ramkripal yadav bhi bijepi aalaa kaman ke samaksh apni daavedaari jataa sakate hai
 Earlier it was discussed that BJP will declare Nand Kishore Yadav as the CM candidate before the elections but to keep the possibility of all caste equations a candidate was not declared before the election
 lekin agar chunaav main bijepi ko bahumat milti he tonandakishor yadavake liye kaaphi sambhaavnaaen bachati hai

 While ridiculing the Congress, the BJP said that it did not declare Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Ministerial candidate on behalf of the party, as it is aware of the possible defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 bhaajapa ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ko congress kii ore se pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne se unki narendra modi ke saath tulana hone lagati or modi ke khilaaf congress upaadhyaksh kii ‘koi sambhaavna nahin’ he
 BJP President Rajnath Singh said that the Congress decision indicated that he had accepted that Modi was going to become Prime Minister
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha ki congress ke faisle se pradarshit hota he ki unhone vaastaviktaa ko sweekaar kar liya he
 He said, i think it is to accept the reality, because they know that they are not going to form the government
 aise main pradhanmantri pad ke liye ummidavaar ghoshit karne kii kya aavashyaktaa he
 i understand that any party that makes such decisions, takes into consideration the realities
 rajyasabha main bhaajapa ke upanetaa ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki congress jaanati he ki vah buree tarah se haaregi or vah nahin chaahegi ki aisi sthiti main gandhi parivaar kaa koi vyakti pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ho
 Prasad said that he knows that the Congress is going to lose a lot
 isi vajah se congress nahin chaahati thi ki rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya jaae
 He said that he did not project him as the prime ministerial candidate, because if he did, he would be compared and analyzed with Narendra Modi
 prasad ne kaha ki sabhi surveykshanon se pataa chalata he ki rahul gandhi unke saamne nahin thaharte
 That is why the Congress made him the head of the campaign by not making him the prime ministerial candidate

 kya yahi he ‘ancounterwali’ sarkaar kaa khoff ki aparaadhiyon kii jagah aaj nari aatankit ho rahi he
 The match between India and New Zealand in the World Cup 2019 was rained out
 
 In this way, this is the fourth match of the World Cup, which could not be done due to rain and had to distribute points between the teams
 yahi nahin, ravivaar ko hone vaale bharat-pakistan match par bhi barish kaa saaya he
 In Manchester, there is a 60 per cent chance of rain in this match, so it should be expected that maybe 20-20 overs will be seen
 yahi vajah he ki england main ho rahe maujuuda world cap ko lekar do baaten kaaphi charchaa main hai ek he england kii barish or doosraa he world cap main prayog main kii ja rahi gilliyaan (bails) jo girti nahin he
 
 
 The rain shadow has hit the World Cup badly this time
 is barish kii vajah se srilanka ke do match or west indies,bangladesh, pakistan or dakshin africa ke ek-ek match radd ho chuke hai
 Due to this, a weak team like Sri Lanka remains in fifth place after scoring 4 points in 4 matches, while they have played only 2 matches in which one match is won and one is lost
 IND vs NZ: bharat-newjiland match barish ke kaaran radd, donon tiimon ko mila ek-ek ankasoshal media par is barish (rain)ko lekar england kii khub khilliyaan udai ja rahi he
 
 kai logon ne to yah kahana shuru kar diya he ki england ko kai saalon tak world cap aayojan se baahar rakhaa jaae
 Many types of questions are also being asked from the ICC that it rains in England at this time, was it not known to the international organization that conducts international cricket
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hone vaali he 15 june ko hone vaale srilanka or afghanistan match main 90 fisadi barish kaa purvanumaan he
 Not only this, on June 16 i
e
 Sunday, india-pakistan match has also been overshadowed by rain
 yahaan bhi barish kaa anumaan 50 fisadi he usee tarah 22 june ko bharat or afghanistan ke bich main bhi 70 fisadi barish kaa purvanumaan he
 The match between India and West Indies on 27 June and Sri Lanka and India on 6 July is also predicted to have 60 per cent rainfall, which means that all these matches can be interrupted by rain and there is a doubt about the completion of the match
 match chota kiya jayega or usamen dakworth louis ke jariye tay kiya jayega ki koun kitne over khelegaa
 This is the way no one knows for sure how many overs are reduced and how many runs will have to be scored
 itihaas gavaah he ki is dakworth louis niyam kii vajah se bharat ek worldcup main apana jeeta hua match ganvaa chukaa he or ek world cap main dakshin africa bhi galat gananaa kii vajah se haar chukaa he
 
 yani england kaa world cap 'indra bhagwaan' ke bharose hi ho paaegaa or koun si team kitna ank paaegi yah khel se nahin barish kii vajah se tay hoga
 Weak teams will be beneficial in this
 
 BAN vs SL: Sri lanka-bangladesh match was canceled due to rain, and this record became the second issue which is very much discussed in this World Cup is the jingles i
e
 the gills which do not fall
 world cap main 5 aise maukey aae jab ball stump ko lagi magar gilliyaan nahin giri wo tiki raheen
 
 aisa keval is world cap hi nahin dekhne ko mil rahaa he, ye ipel main bhi dekhne ko mila
 In this World Cup, South Africa Dickock on Afghanistan's Rashid Khan's ball, Karunaratne on Bolt's ball, Gayle on Mitchell Starc's ball, Saifuddin on Stokes' ball and Warner on Bumrah's ball survived
 yah kaha ja rahaa he ki england main barish or hawa ko dekhte hue stump ke 'gruve' ko shaayad or gaharaa kiya gaya he
 Some believe that the bails are a bit heavier so they are not falling even after the ball is hit
 haalanki isisi kah chukaa he ki gilliyaan utani hi baari hai jitna pehle thim
 But he is not able to give any explanation as to why the gills do not fall
 
 Overall, the two pains of this World Cup are rain and bells

 Reversing the BSP supremo, BJP National Secretary Shrikant Sharma said that Mayawati works only to garner Dalit votes in the name of Dalits, even though she has nothing to do with Dalits
 bijepi ne is maukey par samaajawaadee party ko bhi aade haathon liya or kaha ki sapa or basapa donon ke bich santh-ganth chal rahi he
 Both these parties have been described by the BJP as anti-development, poor Dalits and anti-farmers

 UP CM Yogi Adityanath was being credited with the bjp's victory in Gujarat and Tripura and was about to be sent to the party's campaign in Karnataka but Adityanath failed to win his Lok Sabha seat
 iske badi vajah yahi rahi ki mayawati se sapa ko samarthan diya
 At the same time, the then BJP state president Keshav Prasad Maurya in Phulpur also could not win the party in his seat
 yahaan bhi basapa-sapa kaa gathbandhan kaa sutara hi kaam kiya
 After the results came out, Akhilesh Yadav reached Mayawati's residence and met her
 yah ek bada raajnneetik sandesh he
 In such a situation, the BSP rally in Chandigarh on Thursday is considered special, where the party can start its 2019 election campaign
