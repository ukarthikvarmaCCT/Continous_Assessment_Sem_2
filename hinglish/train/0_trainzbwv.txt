 By the time the Communist Party was greeting Xi in Beijing's Great Hall of People, his anti-corruption campaign had punished 1

 The flow of regular information and even inviting ambassadors and informing about this cleanliness mission was part of this campaign
 ▪ abhiyaan kii safalataa shi kii rajnatik takat main dikhti he
 Independent observers (especially the author of the recently discussed book Chinese Crony Capitalism and Professor Minxin Pe of Clermont mckenna College in California) believe that decisive attacks on large and organized corruption can reduce corruption at a lower level

 Now back to demonetisation 1

 The politico-economic bases of corrupt and black money remained unaffected
 2
 On the parameters of democracy, the government did not appear to be as transparent as expected in the demonetization decisions and results

 Apart from selective scrutiny for political purposes, there was no organized campaign on corruption in high positions

 mulaayam kisi ke nahin hanklyan singh ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ‘‘mulaayam singh ek avasarparast or dhokheybaaj raajnneetijna hai jin par bharosa karnaa unke jivan kii sabase bady galati thi
 "he said" My supporters had warned me about Mulayam Singh but i still trusted him and could not understand his nature
 ’’ singh ne kaha ‘‘raajnneeti main maine kai dhokhe khaaye hai lekin yah sabase bada dhokhaa he
 i will repent for this and will also work to strengthen the BJP
 ’’ unhone kaha ‘‘mulaayam na hinduon ke hai na musalamaanon ke hai na agadon ke hai or na pichhadon ke
 They are just personal
 swaarth ke liye vah kisi ko bhi dhokhaa de sakate hai
 "mulayam himself had sought support from Kalyan Singh
 The former Chief Minister said that Mulayam Singh betrayed Raj Babbar, betrayed the Left parties but the Congress turned out to be smart who understood them and did not weed them
" unhone kaha ki vah mulaayam singh ke paas nahin gayi the balki mulaayam swayan unke paas aaye the or unka samarthan maanga tha
 Kalyan Singh told that Mulayam Singh himself had gone to his son Rajbir Singh's house and SP General Secretary Amar Singh had called him there
 unhone bataaya ki rajbir singh ke ghar par hi mulaayam singh ne unase sapa main shaamil hone kaa aagrah kiya tha lekin unhone party main shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya tha
 Unable to digest his defeat, the former Chief Minister said that after this Mulayam Singh had asked his son Rajbir to allow him to join the SP which he had given and Rajbir joined the SP

 The result of the election for the 16th Lok Sabha not only dismantled many beliefs related to Bihar, but also indicated a change in the old caste equation
 vaise bihar main jaateey sameekaran par chunaav lade jane kii baat puraani he, parantu is chunaav ke baad yah tay ho gaya he ki raajnneetik dalon ke jaateey samikarnon kii deevaaren darak rahi hai
 This also indicates the emergence of a new caste equation in Bihar
 bihar main congress kaa prabhaav kam hone ke baad bihar kii raajnneeti kshetreey kshatrapon ke irdagird gumti rahi thi, parantu pichley varsh bhartiya janata party or janata dal (united) kaa gathbandhan tuutane ke baad sabhi pramukh raajnneetik dalon ne nae jaateey sameekaran kii talash karne lage the
 In such a situation, the major political parties of Bihar took full care of their caste equations even in the ticket distribution in the elections
 rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) ne is chunaav main 17 savarnon ko tikat diya or usamen 14 jite
 The three upper caste candidates who lost were outgoing mps
 bhale hi endie ke adhikansh savarna pratyaashee chunaav jeet gaye hon, magar janata dal (united) or rashtriya janata dal (rajd) kaa koi bhi savarna pratyaashee vijayi nahin ho sakaa
 JD (U) had fielded 10 and RJD and Congress coalition fielded eight upper caste candidates 
 rajd kaa maai (muslim-yadav) sameekaran bhi is chunaav main darakta najar aayaa
 There are many seats where voters of both these castes are more but RJD had to face defeat
 rajd or congress gathbandhan ne is sameekaran ko dhyaan main rakhte hue 11 yadav jati ke pratyaashee vibhinn kshetron se chunaav maidan main utaare the, magar sirf do yadav pratyaashee hi jeet kaa sehara pahan sake
 The NDA had given tickets to four Yadav leaders
 in sabhi ne chunaav jitkar rajd ke yadav-muslim votbank main send maarane kaa ahsaas karaayaa
 The UPA fielded eight Muslim candidates, but only Katihar, Araria and Kishanganj could win their Muslim candidates

 Under this, JDU fielded 13 Muslim candidates, but not a single Muslim candidate could succeed

 Troubled businessman Vijay Mallya has claimed that he paid just $ 100 to buy 'barbados Tridents', a franchise in the Caribbean Premier T20 League
 maalya ne united sprits ke chairman pad chhodane se pehle farvari main sipiel team kharidi thi, iske baad unhone ipel frenchiji royal chalangers bangalore se bhi niyantran ganvaa diya

 ’ Efforts to put the stranded ship MV Pavit back on deep water on Juhu Versova Beach in Mumbai have intensified
 somvaar ko din bhar costguard ne helicopter se jahaaj kaa muyna kiya
 There was a danger that oil may not leak from the ship
 lekin costguard ko is baat kii raahat he ki aisa nahin ho rahaa he
 On Monday, the Coast Guard's rescue team arrived on board the ship directly by helicopter
 jahaaj kaa puraa muyna kiya
 The rescue team gauged the weight of the ship
 ye bhi jaanane kii koshish kii ki kahin jahaaj main koi licage to nahin kyonki kaha ja rahaa he ki jahaaj main kareeb das metric ton tel or 10 ton gas oil bharaa hua he
 In such a situation, there could be a risk of fuel spilling into the sea
 isse jahaaj main aag bhi lag sakati thi
 However, no signs of leakage were found in the ship
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jahaaj ko waapas samandar ke gahare pani main kaise dhakela jayega? rescue oparation ke liye jaruri tha ye pataa lagaana ki jahaaj samandar main kitni gaharaai tak fansaa hua he
 Because it is a double bottom ship
 coast guard kii team ne apane oparation main iskaa andaja lagane kii koshish kii
 Apart from this, the drift of the ship in waves was also estimated in high-altitude conditions
 kyonki samandar main kisi jahaaj ko nikaalane kaa oparation shuru karne kaa sabase acha vakt hai tide ke dauraan hi hota he
 After examining all these aspects, the rescue team has come to the conclusion that it will not be very difficult to remove it
 adhikariyon ke mutabik jahaaj kaa aakaar zyada bada nahin he
 Meanwhile, the Coast Guard has hired Samit International of Singapore to evacuate the ship
 imargency rescue vesals samit lumba ko tainaat kar diya gaya he
 According to DG Shipping the company is owned in Dubai
 rescue oparation kaa puraa kharchaa mumbai main uske agent se vasula jayega
 a case of negligence has been registered against the ship's captain and crew members at the Yellow Gate police station
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki 29 june ko oman ke paas iske ingine main gadabad aane se ye jahaaj bich samandar band ho gaya tha, jiske baad iske 13 bhartiya navikon ko america jangi pot ne kandla port tak pahunchaaya
 But surprisingly, why did no one take the news of the ship's discovery again? a few days ago, MV Wisdom, the consignee of the Singapore company, was stuck here for 22 days
 use badi mushkil se hataaya gaya

 agar tum mujhase baat karnaa chaahate ho to apane shabdon ko paribhaashit karo yah baat woltere ne kahi thi
 For the past seventy years, we have been debating words like religion, secularism and freedom, without defining these words or understanding what they mean in the Indian context - in any discussion on secularism, the facts that religion is not relegated And secularism has no Indian synonym, we have to accept the basic rules
 hindu shabd ko religen kii us pashchimi avadharana ke saath milaayaa nahin ja saktaa jisaki utpatti kaaphi kuch haal hi main hui he
 On the other hand the term Hindu in Indian context is several millennia old
 hindu kaa anivaary arth vah samaaj tha jiskaa jindagi jeene kaa apana saanskrithik or sabhyagat tarika he, uske mul vishwaas hai, paramparaayen or prathaen hai or purvaagrah bhi hai
 Religion plays an important role in Indian way of life and is the basis of our everyday life
 hindu siddhanton kii do misaalen aisi hai jo vichaar, abhivyakti, vishwaas or 'tilijan' kii aazaadee ke nateezon kaa pratik hai
 They were founded not today but 4,000 years ago by unnamed sages
 inamen se ek he vasudaiv kutunbakam yaa 'puri prithvi ek kutumb he' or duusari, ekam sadwipra bahudhaa vadanti yaa ''saarvbhaum yatharth samaan he par alag-alag log ise alag-alag naamon se pukaarte hai
 "in these two declarations made in ancient Hindu India, we see the seeds of globalization and freedom of thought, belief and faith, which were sown 4,000 years before the world became today's global secular village
" is tarah apni pasand ke kisi bhi dharm ko maanane kii samvidhan pradutt aazaadee kii guarantee or sarkaar kaa usamen dakhsandaji nahin karne kaa bharosa, jise bhadra tareeke se secularism kaha jaataa he, hindustan main pracheen kaal se maujuud tha or abhi bhi jari he
 Contrary to the institutionalized norms of basic human right to freedom of faith in Semitak or Semitic religions, the Indian thought process kept faith, belief and worship practices outside the purview of state power and clean from outside influences
 to bhi meljol or samavesh kii kshamta ne hindutv ko parampara main apni jaden jamaaye rakhte hue aadhuniktaa ke prati lacheela, anukool or gatisheel banaaya
 The concept of secularism developed in very different historical processes: the synergy between church rights and state duties and philosophical interventions in Western political history resulted in the state becoming secular and gaining the right to religious freedom
 rajyasatta or dharm ko alag-alag rakhane ke sawaal se bhartiya samvidhan ke nirmaataaon kaa bhi sabaka padaa tha
 Can the Indian state endowed with absolute rights influence every aspect of human life, especially the moral and religious issues that people consider important, integral and distinct in their personal lives, as part of political decisions? The makers were encouraged not only by the freedom movement but also the social, cultural, religious and political underpinnings of Hindu-dominated Indian society and their The gate changes the history and development was probably understand much more clearly

 The Constituent Assembly debated the issue of defining it and declaring India as a clean and officially 'secular' republic and made a deliberate decision not to do so (constituent Assembly Debates, Vol

 All his proposals that included the word 'secular' were also rejected by the Constituent Assembly
 ittefacan raashtrapati shashan pranali ko apnaane kaa unka suzav bhi khaarij kar diya gaya tha
 It is important to note that all these proposals were rejected in the backdrop when incidents of extreme violence were taking place after the tragic partition on the basis of religion and Pakistan declared itself an Islamic republic
 1956 main pakistan 'islamic ganraaj' pakistan ban gaya or usne islam ko aadhikarik dharm ghoshit kar diya
 He did this by following the 1949 Resolution Resolution that envisaged the official role of Islam as the state religion
 jahaan kuch logon ne bharat ko saaf taur par secular rajya ghoshit karne kii vakaalat kii thi, vahiin duusare bhi the jinhone kahin zyada vyapak 'hindutv' ko samvidhan main shaamil karne or is tarah bahusankhyak samudaay ke adhikaron ko manyata dene kii vakaalat kii thi
 The debates of the Constituent Assembly reveal the true nature of a middle-class Hindu who is essentially secular, in the sense that he accepts a sense of respect for all beliefs, philosophies, ideologies and practices of worship (sarva Panth equanimity)

 Kripalani distinguished between the 'tolerance of integralities' and the (absolutely Hindu) tolerance of tolerance
 unhone kaha tha, ''hamen ek-duusare kii aasthaaon kaa sammaan karnaa hoga
 We have to respect it in such a way that it has a share of truth in it
 duniya main koi bhi dharm mukammal nahin he, or phir bhi aisa koi dharm nahin he, jisamen ishwar ke satya kaa kuch ansh na ho
 Going against the ideas of "non-religious state" of Nehru and the Left, the political establishment bowed to the common ritual and adopted the Gandhian symbolism of all-religion prayers and an equal distance with them without abandoning any or all religions

 He underlined the link between Religion-politics and emphasized that political revolutions and changes in India, like all other places, have always taken place after the social awareness developed in the religious mold

 secularism kii avadharana kaa jis tarah aitihaasik vikaas hua or jiske mul siddhant ke taur par europe main carch or rajyasatta ko puri tarah alag rakhaa gaya, vah hindustan ke liye utana hi paraayaa or gaiyrmunasib he, jitna sanyukt samskruti, sahishnutaa or rajyasatta tathaa dharm ke bich sampurna sambandh viched kaa afasana he
 The Hindu way of life: In the Indian environment, every form of worship, including atheism and monotheism, is considered a relentless pursuit of truth
 pashchim or europe main aisa nahin he, jahaan pracheen vishwaason ko butaparasti kahkar inaki bhatrsana kii gai, unke sahitya ko nasht kar diya gaya or naastikta par puri tarah se pabandi laga di gai
 Monotheistic imperialist systems were established by evicting polytheistic societies identified for their diversity of worship, who sought to accept a complete and unquestioned allegiance to the religion of the king or church and a scripture, a god, a church
 From carch kii dharmik taanaashaahee ne dharmatantric rajyasattaaon ko sadiyon tak jinda rakhaa, jab tak ki loktantron ke maatahat prabud sudhaaron or vaigyanik mizaaj kaa ubhaar nahin aayaa

 There has not been a single democratic state in the history of thousands of years in India
 desh ke pehle pradhanmantri nehru ne samvidhan main secularism ko shaamil karne ko naamanzoor kar diya tha or vidambnaa yah he ki do dashakon baad unki beti indira gandhi ne 42wein sanshodhan or 20 pannon ke lambey borevar dastavej ke jariye pradhanmantri or sansad ko na keval abhootpurv adhikaar de die balki samvidhan kii prastaavna sahit uske takreeban harek hisse main vyapak badlaav kiye or 'seprabhu, loktantric ganraajya' ko 'samprabhu, samaajawaadee, secular, loktantric ganraajya' main badal diya
 Was India any less secular from 1947 to 1976, or are we really more secular now because the Constitution says so? Secularism of the country has been an integral part of state policy for centuries
 alpsankhyakon ko sanvaidhanik guarantee asal main siyaasi partiyon ke haathon kaa aujaar ban gai he, jiske dam par ve dharmik aadhaar par gahare dhruvikaran ko anjaam dete hai or vot bainkon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Severe poverty, lack of opportunities and modern education, which many times impose on the communities themselves, unemployment and the biased attitude of elected governments further exacerbate the fear of minorities 'dominance of the majority'
 alpsankhyakon ke algaav ko lekar maujuuda bahes, nichle str kaa bhatkaav hone ke alaava, ek taraf to bahut zyada raajnneeti se prerit maaloom hoti he or duusari taraf use siyaasi tabake kii bhul-chukon ne or zyada bigaad diya he
 It defies the basic guarantees of independence envisaged in the Constitution, although the term minority is not clearly defined
 jab dharm se jude maamalon par faisle dene kii baat aati he, tab insaaf karnaa chunauti ban jaataa he or dharm kii vividhta jitani zyada hoti he, yah chunauti bhi utani hi badi ban jaati he
 Unfortunately, unlike economic and other secular subjects, religion cannot be brought under a statutory regulatory body
 sudhaar or aasthaa par aadhaarit judaavon main nai jaan foonkane ke kaam, jinhen milakar dharm kaha jaataa he, sambandhit samudaay ke bheetar se hi aane hote hai
 Wise people of the society have been able to persuade the leaders of social and religious groups to desist from violence, hatred and intolerance and to build strong bridges between different communities using as many possible symbols of unity

 Pausing the Narendra Modi-led bjp's victory chariot is not going to be easy for Rahul Gandhi
 2019 ke aam chunaavon kii jang main 1 saal se kuch zyada kaa hi samay bachaa he, lekin siyaasi daanv pench isko dhyaan main rakhkar taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 If the BJP is repairing its quiver, then Rahul Gandhi is trying his hand
 aise main desh kaa mizaaj (mood of da nesan) samajhane ke liye lekin ajtak kii ore se karaae gaye survey (agar aaj chunaav ho) main endie ko badhat milti dikh rahi he
 According to the survey, in 2019, the NDA government headed by Narendra Modi is going to be formed once again
 survey main endie ko 309 siten milti dikh rahi hai, to upie kaa aankada bamushkil 100 ke paar jaataa dikh rahaa he
 Rahul can hold Modi's victory chariot! However, there is a ray of hope for Rahul in the survey
 or wo ye ki agar rahul vipakshi ekta banane main kaamyaab rahete hai, to modi kii aguwai main endie jaadui aankade se dur rah jayega
 According to the survey, if Lok Sabha elections are held today, the NDA will get 40 per cent, UPA 38 per cent and others 22 per cent
 haalanki isse pehle kiye gaye survey main NDA ko 42 fisadi vot milane kii baat kahi gai thi yani is baar ke survey main endie kii lokapriyata main do fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Considering the UPA survey to be stronger than sp-bsp-trinamool, it is understandable that if Rahul Gandhi manages the opposition i
e
 TMC, BSP and SP, then UPA will get 38 per cent votes
 yani NDA or UPA ke bich vot kaa antar do fisadi rah jayega
 Similarly, if TMC, BSP and SP join Congress, then UP can get 202 seats, while the NDA will get only 258 seats and others will get 83 seats
 258 siten lekar bhi endie jaadui se dur rah jayega
 Explain that the magic figure is 272 for the majority in the Lok Sabha with 543 seats
 rahul kii lokapriyata main jabardast uchhaalgujrat chunaav ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata main jabardast ijapha hua he
 During this time, the difference of popularity of Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi has decreased by 24 percent
 survey main yah baat bhi saamne ai ki dakshin bharat or muslim bahul ilaakon main aaj bhi indira gandhi hi sabase lokapriy netaa hai
 At 2 pm, three bullets run into a flat and two corpses fall in the Highprofile Society of Hitech City, Gurgaon
 ek laash mahila kii or duusari laash ek mard kii
 But no one could understand why bullets were fired in the flat in the silence of the night
 marane vaale do logon main se pehali goli kisne chalaai, yani police ko ab ye pataa lagaana he ki hatyara koun?aadhi raat ke vakt puraa shahar neend kii agosh main tha lekin gudgaanv ke sector 52 ke arady city ke flats number 17 c kii duusari manzil main kuch chal rahaa tha
 Sleep was far away from the eyes of two people present here
 ghar main do saae chahalkadami kar rahe the badi bechaini or khamoshi ke saath
 a woman and a man are present at night under the roof of 17C
 donon hi saae kisi kashmakash main hai
 Meanwhile a pistol appears in the hands of a shadow
 ye saaya haath main pistaul liye chahalkadami karne lagata he or tabhi ghar kii lobby main ek fire hoti he
 After a few seconds a second bullet goes on and a few seconds later there is a silence in the flat with the sound of the third bullet
 is fire ke baad flats kii lobby main do log lahuluhaan hokar gir padate hai
 One of these two people is female and the other is male
 ghar kaa darwaja andar se band he or ghar main ab do-do laashen padi hai
 Nobody knows who these dead bodies are
 ab sawaal ye he ki gudgaanv kii hiprophile socity ke flats main ye do log koun maujuud the? raat ke do baje ghar main golibari kyon hui? kisne kisapar goli chalaai? maranevaali mahila koun he? marane vaala shaks koun he? flats number 17 si main do mauton kaa raaj kya he? aadhi raat kii do-do laashon kaa sach kya he
 This is a tricky puzzle of two-two deaths in the dark of night, which the police are also trying to solve
 11 taarikh kii subah se hi special cell ke afasar apane tej tarraar inspector badrish dutt ke mobile par kol kar rahe the lekin ghanton guzar jane ke baad bhi badrish kaa phone nahi uthaa to police afasaron ko dutt kii phikr sataane lagi
 The uneasiness of the police officers increased so much that they moved to the flat where Badrish Dutt often stayed at night
 is ghar kii naukaraani subah 11 baje se lagaataar ghar kii ghanti bajaae ja rahi he lekin ghar ke andar se koi bhi darwaja nahin khol rahaa tha
 There was absolutely silence in the house
 abhi naukaraani daravaaje ke khulne kaa intjaar hi kar rahi thi ki kuch police afasar flats main pahunchate hai or daravaaje kii bel bajaate hai
 Seeing the door not opening for long, police officers break the door
 ghar kaa main darwaja tuutate hi ye afasar ghar kii lobby main daakhil hote hai or jaise hi lobby main chand kadam aage badhate hai police afasaron ke bhi pairon tale se jameen khisak jaati he
 Yes, a woman's blood-soaked corpse lay in the lobby of the house
 mahila ke laash ke saath hi ek pistal padaa tha
 a man's body was lying close to the woman's body
 ye laash kisi or kii nahin balki dilli police kii special cell main tainaat inspector badrish dutt kii thi
 Both were shot in the head too
 police ne jab mahila kii laash ki shinaakht kii to pataa chalaa ki ye laash gita sharma naam ki mahila kii he
 Which used to run a private detective agency in Gurgaon itself
 jis flats main police ko ye donon laashen mili wo flats bhi gita sharma kaa hi he, gita is ghar main pichley 9 saal se rah rahi thi
 It was a big case of two deaths at home, so the big officers of Delhi and Gurgaon started coming on the occasion
 shuruaati jaanch main police ko ye laga ki chunki pistaul mahila ke haath ke dahini taraf tha lihaaja aisa lagata he ki pehle mahila ne inspector ko goli maari phir khud ke sir main goli markar khudakushi kar lee
 But this was just a speculation, so the forensic team of the district was also called to find out what happened on the occasion
 darasal jis inspector badrish kii laash flats main mili thi
 He was counted among the bully officers in the Special Cell of Delhi Police
 badrish ne parliament atake se lekar batla house or tamaam terrarist ke madul ko nestnabut karne kaa kaam kiya tha
 But the police could not understand what Badrish was doing in this flat
 jabaki unka parivaar to faridabad main rahata he or wo pehle se shaadishuda hai
 Now the question was what was the Delhi Police inspector doing in a woman's flat in Gurgaon
 gita sharma se badrish kaa rishta kya tha or sabase bada sawaal ye ki aakhir raat ke do baje falat main goli baari kii naubat kyon aa gai
 The most complicated question among these questions is, who shot who, after all
 yani in donon me se katl karke khudakushi karne vaala koun he
 Geeta Sharma killed Inspector Badrish and then committed suicide or else the inspector shot himself after killing Geeta
 dilli police kaa ek supercop, gudgaanv kii ek khubasurat jasoos or ek flats
 The dead body of both in this flat
 gudgaanv ke flats number 17 si kii ye wo mistry he jisane police ke paseene chhudaa die hai
 Yes, there are two important questions in front of the police, first, who fired the first shot and second question is why the bullet was fired
 ye wo sulagate sawaal hai jinka jawaab vaardaat ke 24 ghante baad khud gudgaanv police talash rahi he
 The body of Inspector Badrish was lying on the ground and adjacent to him was the body of Geeta Sharma
 gita ke daahine haath kii taraf badrish kaa sarvice bor glock pistaul padaa tha
 While the bullet hit both the heads
 gita ke sir main goli dahini taraf se lagi thi jabaki badrish ke sir main goli bain ore se lagi dikhaai de rahi thi
 In the initial investigation, it is clear to the forensic expert that both were right handers, so Badrish could not shoot directly on the left tempo with his hand
 jabaki gita sidhe haath se apni dahini canapati par goli aasaani se chalaa sakati hai
 This means that Geeta shot Inspector Badrish first and immediately after committing suicide by tearing a pistol from his temple
 donon laashon ko dekhakar ye maan liya gaya ki pehle goli gita ne chalaai or phir khudakushi kar lee
 Surprisingly, the Gurgaon Police also failed at that time 24 hours after the incident
 jab postmortem karne vaale doctor ne ek ahm khulaasa kiya
 Yes, it was revealed that the bullet to Inspector Badrish was hit on the right forearm and went out from the left side
 jabaki gita ke sir main goli upree hisse main lagi
 That is, the first shot was not fired by Geeta but by Inspector Badrish and then he committed suicide
 ab gudgaanv kii do-do mauton kii ye gutthi doctor ke is bayaan ke baad or bhi ulajhati najar aa rahi he
 The question still remains as to who fired the bullet first and what is the real reason behind this firing that occurred at 2 o'clock in the night? Inspector Badrish was married, yet he lived with Geeta Sharma in live-in relation
 badrish kii bivi kaa kahana he ki unke pati jald hi ghar vaapasi karne vaale the
 In such a situation, the question arises that whether Badrish's decision to return home became the reason for the two deaths? Or is there a relationship of two deaths with the detective world of Geeta Sharma
 1991 batch ke tej tarra police afra badrish kii maut ke baad kai sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 The question was what was Badrish's relationship with Geeta Sharma
 darasal badrish kii shaadi 1999 main ruchi ke saath hui thi
 Life of both of them was passing with laughter and happiness
 isi dauraan badrish ki jindagi main gita sharma ne kadam rakhaa or badrish gita ke behad kareeb aa gaye
 Geeta, who runs a detective agency, was also divorced
 vakt ke saath gita se badrish kii nazdikiyaan is kadar badi ki donon ab ek hi plate main saath rahane lage
 Several fraud cases are going on against Geeta Sharma, who is believed by the police, this year, Geeta also had to be sentenced to 21 days in jail for falsely using the MHA sticker
 gita ne apni diary main likhaa bhi tha ki badrish usase milane jail nahin gaye
 Fights started between Badrish and Geeta only after being released on bail from jail
 inspector badrish kii patni ke mutabik unako apane pati ke gita se rishton kii jaankaree thi, lekin iske baavjood wo talaak nahin lenaa chaahati thim
 Actually, Badrish used to stay with Geeta since her separation from her wife and now the police is also assuming that Geeta's criminal record and family feud are the real reason for these two deaths

 Raja's lawyer said that Chidambaram should be asked whether he had suggested the issue of dilution of shares in the presence of the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha, ‘chidambaram ko adaalat main bulaayaa jaae or poocha jaae ki kya yah baithak pradhanmantri kii maujuudagi main hui thi yaa nahin, or kya aapane (chidambaram ne) yah suzav diya tha yaa nahin
 In the context of the alleged loss to Roskosh, Raja's lawyer said that even the Prime Minister has said in Parliament that no damage has been done
 sibiai ne apane aaropapatr main kaha ki aropiyon main swaan telikam kaa shahid balava or unitech wireles privet limited kaa sanjay chandra ne apane share dubai sthit itislet or norway sthit telinar ko bech diya
 Raja's lawyer said that the court should use its power under Section 311 of the Criminal Penal Code and questioned Chidambaram as a witness
 unhone kaha, ‘us baithak main tatkaaleen vitt mantri ne sheyaron ko kam karne ke mudde par sthiti spasht kiya tha
 Chidambaram is a party to the case and i am not calling him an accused
 sibiai ko jitani jald ho sake unka bayaan darj karnaa chahie
 The defense counsel said, "chidambaram be summoned under section 311 of the crpc and asked if this meeting was held

 LK Advani's ticket has been cut in the list of candidates released by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the Lok Sabha elections
 ab iske baad koi adwani kaa tikat katane ke liye umr ko jimmedaar tehra rahaa he to koi iske liye safai pesh kar rahaa he
 Union Minister Uma Bharti says that Advani's ticket has not been cut, this time he too has made up his mind not to contest
 uma bharti ne kaha ki iskaa kaaran yah he ki adwani pehle bhi kai baar chunaav nahin lade hai
 He said that we cannot forget Advani ji, BJP has reached here today with 2 seats in 1984, it is possible due to Advani ji
 uma bharti ne kaha ki ayodhya andolan kaa netritv adwaniji ne kiya, rathyatra adwani ji ne nikaali, aaj adwani ji ke kaaran hi modi pradhanmantri hai
 It is not just his contribution, his presence is a big thing for the party
 aaj bijepi kaa yah astitv bhi unke hi kaaran he
 Union Minister Uma Bharti said that this thing started from Goa, when there was talk of handing over the command of the campaign committee to Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh became the party president and even then Advani did not go to Goa
 iske kaaran charchaaen chalin or use modi banaam adwani bana diya gaya tha
 Uma Bharti said that the matter has not ended till today and there is only one way to end that matter
 adwani ji se apil karti hum, vah khulkar modiji ko aashirwad den or in baton ko nakaaren
 The elders have taken the younger ones forward with respect, this tradition is also known by Advaniji
 khud ke chunaav na ladane kii ghoshnaa par uma bharti ne kaha ki main ganga ke kaaran, ganga kii padayatra karnaa chaahati hum, isliye main chunaav nahin laduungi
 She said that i have already said, i will win Jhansi with more votes than before
 uma bharti ne daawa kiya ki party ke taraf se unhen khujraho, tamilnadu, punjab or kai jagahon se chunaav ladane ke prastaav mili lekin unhen chunaav nahin ladanaa
 She says that she will participate in the Lok Sabha election campaign and will do politics by staying in the organization
 amit shah ke gandhinagar se chunaav ladane par uma bharti ne kaha ki amit shah gandhinagar se chunaav lard rahe hai bahut acchhee baat he
 She welcomes it
 unka maananaa he ki isse santulan banegaa, gandhinagar se adwani jaisaa hi vyakti chunaav lard rahaa he, amit shah usee raajnneetik viraasat ko sambhaal rahe hai jo adwani ji karte the
 On Prime Minister Modi, Uma Bharti said that Modi is unique, he is complete in himself, he is alone, so i do not talk about the pair
 75 varsh se zyada umr ke netaaon ko tikat na dene ke mudde par uma bharti ne kaha ki multinational companiyaan to ritred logon ko hi rakhti hai or unhen hi kaam detii hai
 Uma Bharti said that the older the gold, the more its value rises
 unka kahana he ki wo is baat ko nahin maanati lekin agar party aisi baat kahati he to yah galat he
 Uma Bharti believes Advani is more fit than him
 uma bharti ne priyanka gandhi par tanj kasate hue kaha ki wo tab nikali, jab unke pati bahut bade aaropon ke daayre main hai or priyanka apane pati ko bachaane ke liye nikali hai
 On the pair of Maya and Akhilesh in Uttar Pradesh, Uma Bharti said that SP and BSP workers do not like each other
 mayawati or mulaayam singh main takaraav ke kaaran jahaan sapa ke ummidavaar honge bispi ke log bijepi ko vot denge or jahaan basapa ke ummidavaar honge sapa ke log bijepi ko vot denge
 Uma Bharti claims that the BJP will benefit from the alliance and the Congress has already lost its air

 banaras hindu uniwarsity kii chaatraon ke andolan ko lekar soshal media ke ek hisse main jis ashleel bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he, wo unke andolan ko lekar hue vivaad se kahin zyaada gambhir he
 This indicates that the political use of social media has eliminated all the modalities of arguing in the public space regarding any issue
 chhedhkhani rashtriya samasya he
 Our girls face it not only in the Banaras Hindu University but anywhere in India
 jab ve iskaa virodh karti hai to jawaab us ghatana ko lekar hona chahie na ki unke andolan main baad main koun aa gaya, kaise naare lag gaye us par
 The question is whether the student was molested within the BHU on the evening of 21 September, then what steps did the university administration take at the same time? We have prepared the sequence of events based on the FIR, the interaction with the girl students
 peedita us vakt cycle par thi or salwar suut pahan rakhaa tha
 Suddenly two bike riders came to him and put his hand inside the suit
 ghatana sthal yani bharat kala bhawan ke saamne raushnee kam thi isliye bhi or ghabrahat main vah bike kaa number nahin dekh saki
 Guards were standing at a distance of ten meters but no one came even after shouting
 vahaan se kuch duuri par ladke khadey the wo ladki kii taraf madad ke liye daude
 When the victim reached the guard to complain, the guard said that if she turns around after six in the evening
 jaanch honi chahie ki kya guard ne vaaki aisa kiya
 What did the guard do when he called
 vaise guard ko hataa diya gaya he
 After calling, the members of the Proctorial Board attended
 unase kaha gaya ki guard ko bulaakar puuchhie ki kyon nahin madad kii to jawaab mila ki chuttee ho chuki he ve ja chuke hai
 Proctorial board officials said that give written complaint, action will be taken
 unase chaatr poochhate rahe ki kya karrwai hogi, aap pehle ye bataaiye
 When asked for CCTV footage, it was said that the next day technicians would come and give the footage
 hamaare paas technician nahin he
 Does BHU not have a technician to check and remove CCTV footage? The girls left from there, the boys kept talking to the officials of the Proctorial Board
 ladki warden ke paas gai, warden ne bolaa ki bas chuaa hi to tha or kya kiya
 Now it should also be investigated whether the warden said so? Conversations between the Proctorial Board officer and the students continued from eleven to twelve o'clock
 saadhe gyaarah baje ke kareeb exiaar darj karaane chaatr pahunche to naam or pataa poocha gaya to ujagar hone ke bhay se dena nahin chahta he
 Hence no FIR was registered
 agle din subah jab triveni hostal kii chatraayen shantipurna march karti hui biechayu ke get par pahunch gayi
 As soon as the rest of the girls hostel came to know, many girls arrived
 exiaar 22 sitambar ko ek baj kar das minute par darj hui
 The time of the incident in the FIR is 6:30 in the evening
 kya biechayu ke bheetar ek din kii ghatana he yaa chhedhkhani aam baat ho chuki he
 The girls' performance was absolutely spontaneous
 baad main duusare chaatr sanghathan or log unke samarthan main aa gaye
 This gave the university an excuse to say that they do not have students in the movement, they are outsiders, this movement has become political
 prashasan ko bahaanaa to mil gaya lekin kya raajnneeti ho rahi he sirf isi aadhaar par chhedhkhani se lekar lathi charge ke sawaal se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Would any parent want their child to go to a university where molestation is common
 sawaal he ki uniwarsity prashasan chaatraon ke saath kyon nahin khadaa hua
 The incident of molestation occurs around 6:30 pm on September 21, the same day, around 3 pm, the students of the new hostel had reported the complaint of molestation to the Procter and Dean
 chaatraon ne memorondom main likhaa he ki aae din raste main chhedhkhani hoti he
 International students also have to face flirting which is shameful for everyone
 ladke chatravaas ke baahar hastmaithun karte hai, pathar phenkate hai or aapatti janak shabdon kaa istamaal karte hai
 The administration also expressed confidence in the action
 tippaniyan Was the VC aware of the lathi charge, whose order led to the lathi charge on campus
 police ko girls hostal main ghusane kii anumati kisne di, chaatraon par laathiyaan kyon baraseen? video footage he ki police ladki ko gher kar maar rahi he, chaatr bhaag rahe hai
 The Vice Chancellor says that a petrol bomb was going on in the campus
 kya biechayu kii ye haalat ho gai he ki vahaan petrol bam chalate hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to look into this issue and find an immediate solution
 siem adityanath ne aiji police se report maangi he
 a case has been filed against 1000 unknown students
 do pulicekarmiyon ko line haazir kiya gaya he yani duty se hataaya gaya he
 The victim was on a bicycle at the time and was wearing a salwar suit
 achaanak do bike savaar uske paas aae or apana haath suut ke andar daal diya
 In front of Bharat Kala Bhavan, the spot was less illuminated, so she could not see the number of the bike in more panic
 das meter kii duuri par guard khadey the magar chillane ke baad bhi koi nahin aayaa
 The boys were standing at some distance from there and they ran towards the girl for help
 jab peedita guard ke paas shikaayat karne ke liye pahunchi to guard ne kaha ki shaam chah baje ke baad ghumogi to yahi hoga
 There should be an investigation whether the guard really did it
 guard ne pukaarane par kya kiya
 By the way the guard has been removed
 phone karne ke baad proctorial board ke sadsy haazir ho gaye
 They were told to call the guard and ask why did not help, then the answer was that they had left
 proctorial board ke adhikariyon ne kaha ki likhit shikaayat dijie, karrwai hogi
 Students kept asking them what action would be taken, you tell it first
 sisitivi kaa footage maanga gaya to kaha gaya ki agle din technician lekar aaiyegaa, footage denge
 We do not have a technician
 kya biechayu ke paas sisitivi kaa footage check karne or nikaal kar dene ke liye technician nahin he? ladkiyaan vahaan se chali gayi, ladke proctorial board ke adhikariyon se baat karte rahe
 The girl went to the warden, the warden said that the bus was touched and what did it do
 ab isaki bhi jaanch honi chahie ki kya warden ne aisa bolaa? gyaarah se baarah baje ke bich proctorial board ke adhikari or chaatro ke bich baatcheet chalati rahi
 When the student came to register an FIR around eleven o'clock, the name and address were asked, and did not want to give the fear of being exposed
 isliye exiaar nahin hui
 The next day morning when the students of Triveni Hostel reached bhu's gate in a peaceful march
 jaise hi baaki girls hostal ko pataa chalaa, bahut si ladkiyaan aa gayi

45 AM
 exiaar main ghatana kaa samay shaam chah baj kar 20 minute he
 Is there a one-day incident or molestation within BHU? ladakiyon kaa pradarshan bilkul swat: sfoort tha
 Later other student organizations and people came in his support
 isse uniwarsity ko yah kehane kaa bahaanaa mil gaya ki andolan main unke chaatr nahin hai, bahari hai, yah andolan raajnneetik ho gaya he
 The administration has got an excuse but whether politics is happening only on this basis the question of molestation and lathi charge can be avoided
 kya koi bhi abhibhavak chahega ki unki bacchee ek aisi uniwarsity main jaae jahaan chhedhkhani aam baat ho
 The question is why the university administration did not stand with the girl students
 21 sitambar kii shaam saadhe chah baje ke kareeb chhedhkhani kii ghatana hoti he, usee din dopaher teen baje ke kareeb naveen chatravaas kii chaatraon ne chhedhkhani kii shikaayat proctor or dean ko saunpi thi
 The students have written in the memorandum that teasing is on the way
 antarrashtriya chaatraon ko bhi chhedhkhani kaa saamana karnaa padataa he jo sabake liye sharmnaak he
 The boys masturbate outside the hostel, throw stones and use offensive words
 prashasan ne karrwai kaa bharosa bhi jataayaa tha
 The comments kya visi ko lathi charge kii jaankaree thi, kiske aadesh se campus main lathi charge hua
 Who gave the police permission to enter the girls hostel, why did the girls lathi? The video footage shows the police besieging the girl, the students running away
 vaais chancelar kehete hai ki campus main petrol bam chal rahaa tha
 Has BHU become the condition that petrol bombs go on there
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath se kaha he ki ve is masale par gaur karen or tatkaal samaadhaan nikaalen
 CM Adityanath has sought a report from the IG police
 1000 agyaat chaatro par mukadmaa darj hua he
 Two policemen have been introduced to the line, ie removed from duty
 jaanch honi chahie ki kya guard ne vaaki aisa kiya
 What did the guard do when he called
 vaise guard ko hataa diya gaya he
 After calling, the members of the Proctorial Board attended
 unase kaha gaya ki guard ko bulaakar puuchhie ki kyon nahin madad kii to jawaab mila ki chuttee ho chuki he ve ja chuke hai
 Proctorial board officials said that give written complaint, action will be taken
 unase chaatr poochhate rahe ki kya karrwai hogi, aap pehle ye bataaiye
 When asked for CCTV footage, it was said that the next day technicians would come and give the footage
 hamaare paas technician nahin he
 Does BHU not have a technician to check and remove CCTV footage? The girls left from there, the boys kept talking to the officials of the Proctorial Board
 ladki warden ke paas gai, warden ne bolaa ki bas chuaa hi to tha or kya kiya
 Now it should also be investigated whether the warden said so? Conversations between the Proctorial Board officer and the students continued from eleven to twelve o'clock
 saadhe gyaarah baje ke kareeb exiaar darj karaane chaatr pahunche to naam or pataa poocha gaya to ujagar hone ke bhay se dena nahin chahta he
 Hence no FIR was registered
 agle din subah jab triveni hostal kii chatraayen shantipurna march karti hui biechayu ke get par pahunch gayi
 As soon as the rest of the girls hostel came to know, many girls arrived
 exiaar 22 sitambar ko ek baj kar das minute par darj hui
 The time of the incident in the FIR is 6:30 in the evening
 kya biechayu ke bheetar ek din kii ghatana he yaa chhedhkhani aam baat ho chuki he
 The girls' performance was absolutely spontaneous
 baad main duusare chaatr sanghathan or log unke samarthan main aa gaye
 This gave the university an excuse to say that they do not have students in the movement, they are outsiders, this movement has become political
 prashasan ko bahaanaa to mil gaya lekin kya raajnneeti ho rahi he sirf isi aadhaar par chhedhkhani se lekar lathi charge ke sawaal se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Would any parent want their child to go to a university where molestation is common
 sawaal he ki uniwarsity prashasan chaatraon ke saath kyon nahin khadaa hua
 The incident of molestation occurs around 6:30 pm on September 21, the same day, around 3 pm, the students of the new hostel had reported the complaint of molestation to the Procter and Dean
 chaatraon ne memorondom main likhaa he ki aae din raste main chhedhkhani hoti he
 International students also have to face flirting which is shameful for everyone
 ladke chatravaas ke baahar hastmaithun karte hai, pathar phenkate hai or aapatti janak shabdon kaa istamaal karte hai
 The administration also expressed confidence in the action
 tippaniyan Was the VC aware of the lathi charge, whose order led to the lathi charge on campus
 police ko girls hostal main ghusane kii anumati kisne di, chaatraon par laathiyaan kyon baraseen? video footage he ki police ladki ko gher kar maar rahi he, chaatr bhaag rahe hai
 The Vice Chancellor says that a petrol bomb was going on in the campus
 kya biechayu kii ye haalat ho gai he ki vahaan petrol bam chalate hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to look into this issue and find an immediate solution
 siem adityanath ne aiji police se report maangi he
 a case has been filed against 1000 unknown students
 do pulicekarmiyon ko line haazir kiya gaya he yani duty se hataaya gaya he

 kabhi congress kaa garh rahi uttar pradesh kii muradabad seat par congress ne is baar shaayar imran pratapgadhi ko maidan main utaara he
 This seat was earlier in the news for speculation about the political debut of Robert Vadra, later Raj Babbar also refused to contest from this seat
 vahiin, pichley chunaav main yahaan se congress ko 20 hajaar vot bhi nahin mili the or vah paanchave number kii party thi
 In such a situation, the Congress has now sent poet Imran Pratapgarhi in the election battle to get his lost land
 imran muslimon main shiksha ko badhaava dene ko lekar kaaphi prayasarat hai
 aajtak
 in se khaas baatcheet main imran pratapgadhi ne kaha ki bhartiya janata party(bijepi) sarkaar sirf nafrat or baantne kaa kaam karti he
 i am contesting from the business city ie Moradabad
 yahaan hindu-muslim dekhakar nahin hota he balki aapasi bhaichaare se kaarobaar hota he
 Imran Pratapgarhi said that the myth of Muslim vote contractors has broken
 samaajawaadee party muslimon ko apana vot bank samajhate ai he, lekin aaj vah muradabad kii jameen par nahin dikh rahi he
 He further said that now Muslims are not the vote bank of any one party
 muslim voter acha pratyaashee or party chun rahaa he
 The voter is thinking deeply about who can remove the BJP from power
 muslim voters jaan chuke hai ki ye sari kshamtaayen keval congress party main he
 Moradabad Lok Sabha seat: Where Modi had first blossomed in the wave, please tell that voting on Moradabad Lok Sabha seat will be held on April 23 in the third phase
 is charan main uttar pradesh samet 14 rajyon kii 119 loksabhaa siton par vot daale jaaenge
 Why did the Congress lose from Moradabad in the last election? In response to a question about the reason for the poor performance of the Congress in the 2014 elections, Imran said that our party's performance in 2014 was not good
 2009 main purv cricketer mohammad ajahrudeen yahaan se 3 lakh se zyada voton se jite the, lekin 2014 main unhone muradabad seat se chunaav ladane se manaa kar diya tha
 The locals were angry because of this, which the party had to suffer
 hindu-muslim ke bich nafrat failana chaahati he bijepijab congress ummidavaar imran se poocha gaya ki muradabad main rashtrawaad kaa mudda prabhavi he yaa sthaneey mudde
 The answer was that both issues are effective here, but the issue of nationalism is prominent
 darasal, bijepi yahaan bhi hindu-muslim ke bich nafrat failana chaahati he, lekin vah apane mansoobon main kaamyaab nahin ho paa rahi he
 However, according to his character, he has definitely tried to divide the voice here
 is baar vah jis sansadeey seat se chunaav lard rahe hai vahaan hindu aabaadi zyada he, lekin muslim ummidavaar sansad tak zyada pahunche hai
 In Moradabad, Hindus constitute around 53 per cent and Muslims around 47 per cent
 gauratlab he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main muradabad sansadeey seat par congress kaa pradarshan behad kharaab tha
 The Congress was in fifth position in the last election and got only 19732 votes
 vahiin, is seat se 2009 ke chunaav main mohammad ajaharuddin congress ke tikat se jite the
 The former cricket captain received more than 3 lakh votes in this election
 imran ko kaha ja rahaa 2019 kaa kumaar vishwasaimran ko 2019 kaa kumaar vishwaas bhi kaha ja rahaa he
 The reason behind this is that Kumar Vishwas was very popular as a poet before coming to politics, Imran is also a famous face among the youth as a poet before this
 haalanki, kumaar vishwaas apane siyaasi safar main kuch kamaal nahin kar paae, lekin congress ko imran pratapgadhi se kaaphi ummiden hai

 ' This species of giant bird is going extinct due to the continuous death of Himalayan vultures
 haal hi main ek jagah 17 himalayan gidhon ke shav paae gaye
 The death of these vultures is suspected to be due to poisonous matter
 uttarakhand main udham singh nagar jile ke nadehi gaanv ke paas paanch din pehle 17 himalayan gidhon ke shav mili or chaar gambhir avasthaa main paae gaye the

 unhone kaha ki oxitosin injection ke anya sideeffect (dushprinaam) avashya hai, lekin yah sambhav nahin he ki bhens kaa shav khaane se giddh mar jaaen
 In the 2007 bird survey, the number of these Himalayan vultures extinct in the state was estimated to increase, but there is anger among wildlife lovers due to the large number of vultures being killed

 ) vatan vaapasi ke baad wing commander abhinandan vardhaman ko vaayu sena ne apane hostel main shift karaayaa he
 It is not yet clear what has come out of Abhinandan's medical report
 medical jaanch kii prakriya abhi puri nahin hui he
 According to sources, after the detention of Wing Commander Abhinandan, the Pakistani Army kept him in a solitary cell
 jahaan unhen nativi, na hi radio, na hi telephone or yahaan tak kii news paper bhinhin diya gaya tha
 According to sources, Abhinandan told that a video was shot forcibly praising the Pakistan Army
 video shoot karaane ke dauraan unhen yah bhi jaankaree nahin di gai thi ki paak piem ne unhen waapas bhejne kaa elaan kar diya he
 Let me tell you that on 27 February, Wing Commander Abhinandan, who displayed indomitable valor during the violation of Indian air border by Pakistani planes, returned home from Pakistan on Friday night
 unki vaapasi se pehle ke kuch ghante sanshay se bhare rahe
 The move is seen as an important step towards easing tensions arising out of India's response to Pakistan's continued support of terrorism
 darasal, shuukravaar ko pakistan wing commander abhinandan ko bharat ko saunpane vaala tha
 For this, complete preparations had been made by India
 vayusena ke adhikari, bhartiya duutavas ke adhikari or sarkaar ke pratinidhi sabhi samay par taiyaar the, magar pakistan kii chalbaasiyon ne dopaher se raat kar diya
 It was earlier told by Pakistan that he would release Abhinandan between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, but he repeatedly delayed
 iske peeche kai vajahen bataayin ja rahi hai
 For example, he wanted to bring the incident to Lime Light
 vah chahta tha ki puri duniya kii najar is khabar par ho
 Abhinandan was flown from Rawalpindi to Lahore by around 3 pm on Friday evening
 magar lahore se wagha border laane main usne itani der laga di, jisase uske napak iraade bhi sabase saamne jaahir ho gaye
 According to sources, Abhinandan was detained in an army camp located in Lahore and Pakistan forcibly made a video of Abhinandan
 yah baat bhi sahi he ki pakistan or bharat ke bich dastavej kii prakriya main bhi kuch samay kii deree hui thi, magar yah deree itani bhi nahin thi ki abhinandan kii vaapasi main dopaher se raat ho jaae
 According to information received from sources, the delay in handing the Indian pilot Abhinandan to India was because the Pakistani authorities asked him to record the statement on camera
 iske baad hi unhen seemaa paar karke swadesh jane diya gaya
 Apart from this, issues related to documents also became a reason for delay
 sutron ne bataaya tha ki pakistan ne unki rihaai kaa samay do baar taal diya
 Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar Shiv Dular Singh Dhillon told that the brave pilot is happy to return to his country
 yah puche jane par ki abhinandan ne swadesh lautne par adhikariyon se kya kaha, upayukta ne kaha tha ki vah pehle muskuraae or bole, 'main apane desh waapas lautakar khush hum
 He was handed over to BSF officers after some formalities at the Wagah Attari border
 baad main vayusena ke adhikari apane saath abhinandan ko lekar aae
 The wing commander was then taken from the Attari border to Amritsar in an Air Force vehicle
 is dauraan punjab police kii gaadiyaan unke vaahan ke saath chal rahi thim
 After this Vardhman was brought to Delhi by air
 wing commander abhinandan 27 farvari ko subah kareeb das baje pakistani vayusena ke fiter plane kaa peechha karte hue pakistan kii seemaa main ja ghuse the
 Abhinandan's plane also crashed after Pakistan killed the F-16
 is vajah se unhen kisi tarah parachute kii madad se utarana padaa
 When he came down, he did not realize that he had reached the land of enemy country
 kuch log unke paas aae, jinase abhinandan ne poocha ki vah kahaan hai
 On this, some Pakistanis showed tact and told them that you are on the Indian side
 magar abhinandan ko kuch shaq hua
 After this he shouted slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai
 iske baad phir pakistaniyon ne unhen gher liya
 Abhinandan somehow ran away to save himself
 baad main unhen pakistani sena ne apni hiraasat main le liya
 The army questioned him, but Abhinandan opened his mouth as much as he was allowed to tell in the Air Force
 iske baad unhen pakistani sena ne chaay-coffee bhi pilaai
 Then after the announcement of Imran Khan, the world came to know that he will return to his homeland after just two days
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne abhinandan kii vaapasi kaa swaagat karte hue twit main kaha tha ki ‘wing commander abhinandan aapkaa ghar main swaagat he
 The nation is proud of your indomitable courage
 hamaare sashastr bal desh ke 130 karod bharatiyon ke liye prerana kaa strot hai
 On the return of Wing Commander Abhinandan, the eyes of the entire country were seen all day on the Wagah border
 itnaa hi nahin, wing commander abhinandan ko rahul gandhi, samet kai raajnneetik netaaon ne badhai di or unki vatan vaapasi par twit kiye
 As Air Force officer Abhinandan Vardhaman returned from Pakistan's custody, a large number of media persons were eyeing it and people from all over the country stared at the TV set
 ataari bagha seemaa ke paas checkpost par subah se hi log tirangaa liye jamaa the
 Many of them had their faces painted with a tricolor and were also shouting slogans in support of the safe return of Wing Commander Abhinandan and there was an atmosphere of celebration
 gauratlab he ki bhartiya vaayu sena ne pakistani seemaa main jaish e mohammad ke thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Thereafter, the Indian Air Force was violated by the Pakistani Air Force and during the air conflict during this time Pakistan's F
 
 16 aircraft were dropped and India's mig 21 crashed

 In these three years, Sachin along with the Indian team won the IPL and Champions League titles this year along with their franchise team Mumbai Indians of the ICC World Cup-2011 and Indian Premier League (IPL)
 vankhede stadium main 2011 main khele gaye vishwa cap final main srilanka par mili khitaabi jeet ke baad bhartiya khilaadiyon ne sachin ko apane kandhe par uthaakar puure stadium kaa chakkar lagaaya tha
 It was the first World Cup title of Sachin's playing career and by far the biggest achievement
 do saal baad hi sachin ko kolkata main bilkul vahi najaara dekhne ko mila, jo unhone mumbai main 2011 main dekha tha
 His team defeated Chennai Super Kings to capture the IPL title for the first time
 kolkata main bhi mumbai indiens ke khilaadiyon ne sachin ko kandhe par baitaakar stadium kaa chakkar lagaaya tha
 Sachin said after the IPL that he would no longer play Twenty20 cricket but to his surprise, his name was included in the Champions League squad
 tab sachin ne kaha ki yah unka aakhri twanti-20 toornament hoga
 For Sachin, this event was not special in terms of individual as he could score 15, 5, 0, 35 and 15 runs in five innings but his team reached the final and won the title by defeating Rajasthan Royals
 is baar bhi sachin ko unke saathiyon ne firozshah kotla maidan main kandhe par baitaakar ghumaya
 Luck is so kind to Sachin that till three years ago it was being said that Sachin's career would end without a World Cup title but now his career has included three big titles
 yahi nahin, unke team main rahete bhartiya team test ranking main sheersh par bhi pahunch chuki he
 So what further records are Sachin's names, it will only tell the time to come

 There has been a controversy over re-tweeting a tweet by Delhi CM and Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal
 darasal, sangeetkaar vishaal dadlani ne somvaar ko ek twit kiya tha, 'ham ek murkh or hatyare ke bich funs gaye hai
 What will happen to India now? ' dadlani ke is twit kii bhashaa behad aapattijanak he
 This tweet is being seen in the context of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and bjp's PM candidate and Gujarat CM Narendra Modi
 aise main is twit ko ri-twit kar kejariwal nae vivaad main funsate dikh rahe hai
 Stuck between a moron and a murderer
 
 
 
 what now, India !? - VISHAL DADLANI (@vishaldadlani) January 27, 2014 BJP leader Nirmala Sitharaman has condemned Kejriwal's re-tweet
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal ke is tarah ri-twit kaa koi matlab nahin tha
 They should take care of their language on a public platform
 sitaraman ne siem kejariwal ko chetavanee dete hue kaha ki vah twit karne se pehle saavdhaanee baraten
 Dudlani's tweet came after an interview by Rahul Gandhi in which the Congress Vice President blamed Narendra Modi's Gujarat government for the 2002 Gujarat riots
 rahul ke isi intervyuu ke baad vishaal dadlani ne yah twit kiya jise kuch samay baad hi kejariwal ne ri-twit kar diya
 Kejriwal Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party supporters Vishal have been in controversies even before their exploits
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke liye prachaar ke dauraan dadlani ke vivaadit bol se kejariwal and company kii kaaphi kirakiri hui thi
 In fact, during the election campaign, Dudlani used offensive words for the opponents of the Aam Aadmi Party
 dadlani ne bollywood ke gane 'bachanaa e haseenon
 
 
 'on the lines of' refrain a bastards
 
 
 lo 'aap' aa gaya
 
 
 'sang
 jis vakt yah sab kuch ho rahaa tha, us vakt arvind kejariwal or party netaa va aarake puram vidhansabha seat se ummidavaar shajia ilmi bhi vahiin maujuud the
 The promise of promises made by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, which made big promises before the elections, is seen in just six months
 mahangaai or bhrashtachar ke mudde par pichhali sarkaron ko gherne vaale kejariwal ab apane hi failaae jaal main funsate dikh rahe hai
 Actually, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has made promises to the public but they are losing their sweat in fulfilling them, whether it is inflation or corruption
 ye hai wo paanch mudde jinpar 'aam aadmi' kii sarkaar ne badali apni chaal-1
 Hoardings of action against the corruption of corruption in cases of corruption are seen all over Delhi
 in bade-bade hordings par kejariwal sarkaar daawa kar rahi he ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jang shuru ho chuki he
 In response to an RTI, it has been revealed that Kejriwal government is claiming arrest of 35 officers in hoardings but there is only one officer in it, the rest are lower level employees
 dilli ACB ne bataaya ki kejariwal sarkaar banane ke baad ek july 2015 tak kul 41 log giraftaar kiye gaye hai
 These include three people who have been suspected of taking a bribe of Rs 10
 yahi nahin, kuch aise log bhi hai jinka sarkaar se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Except for the chief engineer, all the accused are lower level employees

 The AAP government is sitting under the report of the 400 crore scam
 AAP government, who did not take any softness in corruption cases during the government of Shila Dixit, promised that Kejriwal may have become so busy enjoying power that he did not care about the promises
 dilli main congress sarkaar ke dauraan water tanker se jude 400 karod rupee ke ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye kejariwal sarkaar ne kareeb ek maheene pehle cameti gathit kii thi or use 10 din main report pesh karne ko kaha tha
 According to sources, in this case the committee submitted its report to the government within the stipulated time, but it is not known to anyone who has the report and what action has been taken by the government
 kejariwal sarkaar ke kanoon mantri kapil mishra ne bhi report ke sambandh main koi jaankaree hone se inkaar kiya he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the Kejriwal government wants to suppress the report? 3
 pyaaj kii keemton par jari he darty politics!mahangaai kaa ronaa rone vaali dilli sarkaar ne janata ke hiton ko nazarandaaj karte hue pyaaj par bhi raajnneeti shuru kar di
 When NAFED agreed to give onions to the Delhi government at a cheaper rate, the government wrote a letter and put its peculiar conditions in front of them
 beete shuukravaar ko dilli sarkaar ne nafed ko ek chitthee bheji jisamen likhaa ki dilli sarkaar nafed se pyaaj kharidne kii ichha rakhti he lekin uski do sharten hai
 The first condition is that the price of onion should not be more than Rs
 19 and this 19 rupees includes storage loss which is called storage loss and also the cost of transportation i
e
 transportation and secondly, the delivery of onion is also required to the government by Anand Vihar of Delhi
 i want, not that she will take onion from Nashik
 pole khulne par sarkaar or party ke netaa puri tarah is baat se mukar gaye or kaha ki unhone koi chitthee nahin likhi, jabaki nafed ke paas sabhi patr maujuud hai

 waite badhaakar dhili kar di aam aadmi kii jebkejariwal sarkaar ne aam aadmi kii jeb main daaka daalate hue bajet satr main waite (VAT) sanshodhan bill paas kiya
 The fourth schedule of Part 4 of this Act states that VAT rates on more than a dozen items will be increased to a maximum of 30 percent
 kejariwal sarkaar ne manoranjan-kar main bhi 100 fisadi kii badhottaree kar di, jiske baad dilli main cinema dekhnaa mahangaa ho gaya
 The matter does not end here; now, freight vehicles carrying goods from other states in Delhi will have to pay tax from Rs 100 to Rs 1500
 yahi nahin, kejariwal sarkaar ne petrol-dijal kii kharid par bhi waite badhaakar aam aadmi par boj badha diya

 jab khud bole kejariwal- puure nahin honge ye vademukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne satta sanbhaalane ke tisare hi maheene main apane vaadon ko puraa na kar paane kaa sach kabool kiya he
 He said that the government will run for five years but only 50 percent of the promises made in the list of promises made to the public can be fulfilled
 kejariwal khud bijepi or congress par ye aarope lagaate rahe hai ki ye donon partiyaan janata se vaade to bahut karti hai lekin unhen puraa nahin karti hai, lekin jab khud par baat ai to kejariwal do took hi bol sake
 To win the election, he raised a mountain of breathtaking promises, but when it came to fulfillment, he raised his hand already
