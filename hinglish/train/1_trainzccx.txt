 Ashish Nehra retired from international cricket on Wednesday
 newjiland ke khilaaf firozshah kotla main khele gaye tii20 match ke ant main nehra ne kuch malaal bhi jaahir kiye or team chayan ko lekar mukhya chayankarta par nishaanaa bhi saadhaa
 Nehra, who has played 17 Tests, 120 odis and 27 T20 matches for India in a career spanning almost 19 years, said, "there are definitely some rubbers, but i consider myself lucky that despite so many injuries, my career is so long Pulled
 aankade bhale kuch or kahani kehete hon kyonki maine apana antim test 2004 main khelaa tha jab main 24-25 saal kaa tha
 On the question of saying goodbye to cricket, Nehra said that he did not inform the selection committee about the retirement decision and only informed the team management
 unhone kaha, 'meri chayansmiti ke adhyaksh (emesake prasad) se koi baat nahin hui
 i told the team management about my decision in Ranchi
 jab maine viraat se baat kii to usne poocha kya main shyor hum
 He suggested that i could play in the IPL
 'nehra ne kaha, 'saubhaahgya se yah match dilli main tha
 i did not ask for any farewell match
 maine chayankartaaon se sanyas ke bare main baat nahin kii
 When i started playing i did not ask the selectors
 ' unhone haalanki kaha ki agar vishwa cap chah maheene baad hota to vah sanyas ke apane faisle par punarvichaar karte
 Nehra, who made his debut in international cricket through Test cricket in February 1999 against Sri Lanka, said, 'I made my debut almost 19 years ago and now i am retiring in 38 years
 yah bhavuk kshan he kyonki ab main vah nahin karuunga jo pichley 19 saal se kar rahaa tha
 Even the players who are playing now know that there is life after cricket
 ve bhi hameshaa nahin khelenge
 One day he too has to retire
 ' nehra kaa kariyar choton ke kaaran utaar chadhaav vaala rahaa jiskaa unhen malaal bhi he
 He said, 'I am an ordinary person and i am very happy where i am
 main aankadon par zyada vishwaas nahin karata
 Still there are some maladies like battling injuries but this is the truth
 yahaan tak ki sachin tendulkar bhi sochate honge ki main 5000 ran or bana saktaa tha
 Nehra said, "mahendra Singh Dhoni and Gary Kirsten wanted me to play Test cricket in 2009 but i made it clear that first let me play the 2011 World Cup and then decide
 ab main apane anubhav ko yuva tej gendbaajon main baant saktaa hum
 The fast bowler said that he is not unhappy with the team management's decision not to be selected in the ODI team after the World Cup 2011, but he could have done well during this time
 unhone kaha, ' main aisa vyakti rahaa hum jo team prabandhan ke faislon par kabhi sawaal nahin uthaata
 If they do not choose me, then it is their decision
 maine kadi mehnat jari rakhi kyonki kehete hai ki kisi kii mehnat kabhi kharaab nahin jaati
 It is with regret that in these three four years i could do well for the country
 main acha khel rahaa tha or ipel main behatar pradarshan kar rahaa tha
 ' somvaar ko gujarat vidhansabha main sarkaar ke van or paryaavaran mantri ganpat vasava se gir ke babbar sher ke bare main sawaal poocha gaya or usapar jo jawaab mila usase log hairaan rah gaye
 In fact, Minister Ganpat Vasava told the assembly that in the last two years 184 lions, lionesses and their cubs have died
 jisamen 152 sher kii prakritik mrityu hui he jabaki 32 sheron kii aprakritik mrityu hui he
 In response to this question asked by Congress MLA Ghyasuddin Sheikh, the Forest Minister said that 104 lions were killed in 2016 and 80 lions in 2017
 saath hi vidhansabha main rakhe gaye aankadon ke mutabik do saal main hui 184sheron kii mautamen 74 sherniyaan hai jabaki 71 sher or 39 sheron ke bachche yani shavakon kii maut darj kii gai he
 In which 152 lions died of natural deaths in 2016-2017, 92 in 2016 and 60 lions in 2017
 vahiin 32 sheron kii aprakritik maut hui jinamein se 12 kii maut varsh 2016 main or 2017 main 20 sheron kii maut hui he
 Many times in unnatural death, a lion falls into an open well, dies from a train on a railway track passing through the middle of Gir
 jis par mantri ne kaha ki gujarat main sheron kii hone vaali aprakritik maut ko lekar sarkaar ne gir ke aasapaas ke ilaake main khule kuen par diwaar bananaa, railway treks ke aasapaas fensing karnaa saath hi sher kii movement ko monitor karne ke liye vanpraani mitra ko bhi appoint kiya he, jo svaichhik sher kii raksha karne kaa kaam karte hai
 The political crisis in Karnataka has once again reached the Supreme Court
 karnataka main congresske paanch or baagi vidhayakon ne vidhansabha spikar ke khilaaf supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya he
 These mlas have filed a petition in the Supreme Court, stating that the Speaker of the Assembly is not accepting his resignation
 in vidhayakon main sudhakar, roshan beg, emtibi nargaj, muniratn or anand singh ke naam hai
 Now with these five mlas, the number of rebel mlas who have approached the Supreme Court has increased to 15
 isse pehle karnataka main jari raajnneetik asthirataa ke bich varisht congress netaaon ne vidhansabha se istipha dene vaale asantusht vidhayakon ko manaane ke liye parde ke peeche se baatcheet shuru kar di thi
 Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy surprised everyone in the Assembly by announcing that he would give a vote of confidence, a day after which efforts to convince disgruntled mlas have been intensified
 congress ke sankatmochak maane jane vaale evam jal sansaadhan mantri di ke sivakumar subah kareeb paanch baje awaas mantri em tii bi nagaraj ke awaas pahunche or vah unhen manaane ke liye kareeb saadhe chaar ghante tak vahaan rahe
 According to reports, Deputy Chief Minister Parmeshwar also went to his house to convince Nagaraj to withdraw his resignation
 nagaraj ne buudhvaar ko vidhayak pad se istipha de diya tha
 Similarly, attempts were made to convince mlas Ramalinga Reddy, Mani Ratna and r Roshan Baig
 jad (es) main sutron ne bataaya ki kumaraswami istipha dene vaale kam se kam chaar congress vidhayakon ke saath sidhe sampark main hai or unhen ummid he ki ve apane istife waapas le lenge
 Perhaps in the coming week, both Congress and BJP have sent their mlas to hotels and resorts as part of an exercise to keep the legislators united in view of the trust vote
 in ghatnakramon par bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh bi es yediurppa ne kaha ki in prayaason kaa koi nateeja nahin nikalegaa kyonki sarkaar kaa patan 'nikat' he
 Yeddyurappa told reporters here, 'there is confusion in Congress and JD (S) due to which mlas are leaving the party
 vidhayakon ko waapas laane ke liye ek vyavasthaagat sajeesh chal rahi he
 "the atmosphere is chaotic and the downfall of the government is imminent," he said
 ' yediurppa ne daawa kiya ki rajya sarkaar bahumat kho chuki he
 He said that it is 'futile' not to believe
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne shuukravaar ko congress-jad(es) gathbandhan ke 10 asantusht vidhayakon ke istife par adhyaksh ko 16 july tak yathasthiti barkaraar rakhane ke aadesh die the jiske baad kumaraswami ne sadan main vishwaas mat karaane kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 a coalition government was formed in Karnataka after the hung assembly last year
 tab se hi sarkaar utaar-chadhaav ke kai daur se gujri he
 The government is now going through a serious crisis
 uske 16 vidhayakon ne vidhansabha se istipha de diya he
 Of these, 16 mlas are from Congress and three are from JD (S)
 sattarudh gathbandhan main adhyaksh ko chhodkar kul 116 vidhayak (congress ke 78, jad(es) ke 37 or basapa ke 1) hai
 The BJP has a strength of 107 in the 224-member house with the support of two independents
 agar 16 vidhayakon ke istife manjuur kiye jate hai to gathbandhan kii sankhya ghatakar 100 rah jaaegi
 Bad days are now coming for the bank scamsters and those accused of running away with money
 centre sarkaar ke dwaara bhagoda aarthik apradhi adhyadesh ko manjuuri milane ke baad pravartan nideshaalay ection main aa gaya he
 The introduction of this new law could tighten the screws on the accused like Nirav Modi, Vijay Mallya and Mehul Choksi
 idi is kanoon ke tahat kareeb 16000 karod rupye kii sampatti ko jabt kar sakati he
 If sources are to be believed, in the case of these three, the ED can approach the PMLA court and can seize the property if they are declared as fugitives
 gauratlab he ki teenon kii talash jari he or teenon hi ghapala karne ke baad videsh main hai
 After the new law comes, the ED will be able to tighten the screws on them
 idi abhi tak vijay maalya kii kareeb 9000 karod rupye kii sampatti ko atech kar chukaa he
 And under the new law, the ED will have the power to seize the property of the fugitives
 vahiin neerav modi or mehul chokasee ke maamle main bhi idi ko kareeb 7000 karod rupye kii sampatti kaa pataa chalaa he
 Both are accused of defrauding Punjab National Bank of about Rs 14000 crore
 aane vaale kuch hi dinon main idi apni takaton kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar saktaa he
 Significantly, in this ordinance, there will also be fugitive criminals, who are under arrest warrants on charges of printing fake government stamps and currency, withdrawal of checks due to lack of money, money laundering and cheating the lender
 desh main chunaav kaa mausam he
 Assembly elections in five states are being seen as semi-finals before next year's Lok Sabha elections
 madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh, telugana or mizoram main ho rahe chunaav main jeet kaa paracham lahraane ke liye congress or bijepi donon hi partiyaan koi kasar nahin chhodana chaahati he
 In three of these five states, the BJP has a government, while the Congress in Mizoram and the TRS in Telangana
 ek taraf congress jahaan madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main vaapasi kii raah dekh rahi he to vahiin bijepi kii najar in rajyon main ek baar phir satta par kabiz hone kii he
 While Rahul Gandhi is taking charge from the Congress side, PM Modi has taken the front from the BJP himself
 donon hi netaa dhuandhar chunavi reliyaan kar rahe hai
 In these rallies, the two leaders are also attacking each other vigorously, but some Congress leaders create trouble for the party by their statements, against which the Congress President himself has to come forward
 ek ore jahaan ab tak chunaav ke dauraan bhrashtachar, aparaadh, vikaas, berogari par netaa bayaan dete the, to vahiin ab netaaon ke bol virodhiyon ke mata-pita tak pahunch gaye hai
 Congress leader made a statement about PM Modi's father
 Actually, a Congress leader made a statement about PM Modi's father
 purv kendriya mantri vilasarav mutevar ne piem modi ko lekar kaha tha ki jis pradhanmantri modi ke pita kaa naam kisi ko pataa nahin he, wo modi rahul gandhi se hisaab maangate hai, jabaki ek rahul gandhi hai jisaki pidiyon ke bare main sabko pataa he
 The former Union Minister said that who knew Narendra Modi before becoming PM, said that Narendra Modi who is confronting Rahul Gandhi
 aaj bhi piem narendra modi ke baap kaa naam koi nahin jaanata he, lekin rahul gandhi ke baap kaa naam to kya pidiyon kaa naam tak sabhi ko pataa he or jiske baap kaa naam pataa nahin wo pradhanmantri modi, rahul gandhi se hisaab maang rahe hai
 What are you asking for? haalanki khud congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kabhi piem modi ke mata-pita par koi bayaan nahin diya he, lekin unke netaa jis tarah se bayaan de rahe hai wo unke liye musiibat khadi kar de rahe hai
 'PM Modi retaliated' PM Modi also did not delay in retaliating against this Congress leader
 unhone madhya pradesh ke vidisha main raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki mere pita jinka 30 saal pehle hi nidhan ho chukaa he, aisa kya kaaran he ki ve mere mata-pita ko isamen ghaseet rahe hai
 PM Modi said that i do not make a statement about anyone's family, but i am speaking against the former Prime Minister
 agar mere mata-pita raajnneeti main hote to congressiyon ko un par bolne kaa haq tha
 Let me tell you that PM was talking about Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii nani indira gandhi or pita rajeev gandhi desh ke purv pradhanmantri rah chuke hai
 'the rupee has come down below the age of PM Modi's mother'
 Earlier, Congress MP Raj Babbar had made PM Modi's mother Heeraben Modi's age with the falling rupee in the international market against the US dollar
 ek raily main unhone kaha tha ki aaj rupaya piem modi kii maa kii umr se neeche aa pahunchaa he
 PM Modi's attack on Gandhi family: PM Modi often attacks Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi in their rallies
 wo reliyon main neshnal herald maamle ko lekar sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ko gherte hai or kehete hai ki jo log karodon rupee kii hera-pheri main jamaanat par nikle hai, maa or betaa donon jamaanat par hai, wo hamase sawaal puch rahe hai ki notebandi kyon kii?haal hi main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi ne kaha tha nehru-gandhi kii chaar pidiyon ne is desh par raaj kiya he, lekin is dauraan unhone garibon ko sirf dhokhaa diya he
 The PM said that Indira ji had given the slogan, "poverty will be removed, but has the poverty subsided till date"

 saath hi sarkaar ne aashwast kiya ki nayi kar pranali main upabhoktaaon or rajyon ke hiton ko puri tarah se surakshit rakhaa jayega tathaa krishi par kar nahin lagaaya jayega
 The Rajya Sabha has passed the Union Goods and Services Tax Bill 2017 (C GST Bill), Integrated Goods and Services Tax Bill 2017 (I GST Bill), Union Territory Goods and Services Tax Bill 2017 (UT GST Bill) and Goods and Services Tax (compensation to States)
 After joint discussion on the Bill 2017, the Lok Sabha was returned by voice
 in vidheyakon par laaye gayi vipaksh ke sanshodhano ko ucch sadan ne khaarij kar diya
 Due to the money bill, these four bills had the right to be discussed only in Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa 29 march ko in vidheyakon ko manjuuri de chuki he
 Responding to the discussion on the Goods and Services Tax Bills, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley stated the opposition's apprehensions that these bills are being compromised with the rights of Parliament in terms of taxation
 unhone kaha ki pehali baat to yah he ki isi sansad ne samvidhan main sanshodhan kar jiesti parishad ko karon kii dar kii sifarish karne kaa adhikaar diya he
 Jaitley said that the GST Council is the first federal decision making body
 samvidhan sanshodhan ke aadhaar par jiesti parishad ko model kanoon banane kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 As far as law making is concerned, it will be on the basis of federal structure, while the supremacy of Parliament and state legislatures will remain
 haalanki in siforeeshon par dhyaan rakhana hoga kyonki alag-alag rajya agar alag dar tay karenge to arajak sthiti utpann ho jaayegi
 This is a plausible explanation and should not be interpreted otherwise
 unhone kaha ki samvidhan main sanshodhan kar yah sunishchit kiya gaya he ki yah desh kaa ekmaatr aisa kar hoga jise rajya evam kendra ek saath ekatra karenge
 Clarifying the situation on objections about having multiple tax rates instead of creating a uniform tax, the Finance Minister said that there are many food products which are currently taxed at zero and no tax will be levied even after the GST system is implemented
 kai chijen aisi hoti hai jin par ek samaan dar se kar nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 For example, rates of tobacco, alcohol, etc
 are high, while the normal rate on clothes
 jetali ne kaha ki jiesti parishad main charchaa ke dauraan yah tay hua ki aarambh main kai kar lagaana zyada saral hoga
 The Finance Minister said that the GST Council has fixed rates of 0, 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent in the GST regime after discussions
 lakjri kaaron, bottle band vaatit peyon, tambaakoo utpaada jaisi ahitkar vastuon evam koyala jaisi paryaavaran se judi saamagree par iske upar atirikt upkar bhi lagane kii baat kahi he
 He said that the cess levied by more than 28 percent will go to the Compensation Fund and the states which are suffering losses will be given out of it
 aisa bhi suzav aayaa ki ise kar ke rup main lagaaya jaae
 But imposition of tax would have affected consumers
 baharhaal, upabhoktaaon par atirikt kar nahin lagaaya jaayegaa
 Jaitley said that compensation will be given to those states which are suffering losses due to the implementation of GST system
 yah aarambh ke paanch varshon ke liye hoga
 He said that there was no consensus on GST during the Congress-led UPA government because there was no offer for compensation to the disadvantaged states
 jiesti main muaavje kaa praavdhaan deal karne main sahaayak’ hua or rajya saath aae
 Giving clarification on the objection of many members to the real estate sector not being included in the GST, the Finance Minister said that this is an area in which states get a lot of revenue
 isamen registry tathaa anya shulkon se rajyon kii aay hoti he isliye rajyon kii raay ke aadhaar par ise jiesti main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 He also clarified that in taking any decision in the GST Council, the vote of the Center is only one-third while the states have two-third vote
 isliye koi bhi faisla karte samay centre apni raay thopane ke paksh main nahin he
 Terming the Goods and Services Tax as the first federal contract to be constitutionally approved, Jaitley said that it would pave the way for imposing a system of 'one nation, one tax' in the country through GST while not imposing additional tax burden on consumers
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki jiesti parishad kar dhaanche ko sarvasammati se tay kar rahi he or is bare main ab tak 12 baithken ho chuki hai
 The bill is based on the principle of shared sovereignty between the central and state governments and is the first such initiative
 jiesti ke lagu hone par kendriya str par lagane vaale utpaada shulk, sevakar or rajyon main lagane vaale mulya vardhit kar (waite) sahit kai anya kar isamen samahit ho jaayenge
 Jaitley clarified the bills and said that through the Central GST Bill, the Center will have the right to levy tax in the event of excise, service tax and additional customs duty
 samanvit jiesti yaa ijiasti ke jariye vastu or sevaaon kii rajyon main awajahi par centre ko kar lagane kaa adhikaar hoga
 While clarifying the situation regarding the provision to stop earning profits in relation to tax exemption, the Finance Minister said that if 4
 5 pratishat kar chhot di jaati he tab iskaa arth yah nahin ki use nijee munafa mana jaae balki iskaa laabh upabhoktaaon ko bhi diya jaae
 This is the meaning of this provision
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki real estate kii tarah hi sthiti sharaab or petroleum utpaadon ke sambandh main bhi thi
 Petroleum products have been brought under its purview after discussions with the states but it has been kept under zero rate for now
 is par jiesti parishad vichaar karegi
 Alcohol is still outside its scope
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki pehle ek vyakti ko vyavsaay ke liye kai moolyankan agenciyon ke paas janaa padataa tha
 In order to carry on economic activities, one had to undergo excise, service tax, state VAT, Manaranjan tax, entry fee, luxury tax and many other taxes
 vitt mantri kaha ki vastuon or severa kaa dersh m sugam pravaah nahin tha
 In such a situation, the GST system was pushed forward
 ek aisa kar jahaan ek moolyankan adhikari ho
 Mostly self assessment and only limited evaluation except in audit cases
 jetali ne kaha ki kar ke upar kar lagata he jisase mudrasphiti kii pravriti badhati he
 Hence the idea of making the whole country a market
 yah baat ai ki saral vyavastha desh ke andar laai jaae
 Stating that bringing agriculture under the purview of GST, the Finance Minister said that agriculture and farmers do not require registration
 dhara 23 ke tahat krishak evam krishi ko chhot mili hui he
 It is therefore placed in the definition to explain this exemption
 is bare main koi bhram nahin hona chahie
 Jaitley said that there should be no confusion about when agricultural products are zero-rate
 tippaniyan Rejecting the objections of the Congress in this regard, Jaitley said that 29 states, two union territories and the center had considered this, which included eight finance ministers of the Congress-ruled state
 tab kya in sabhi ne milakar ek khaas varg ke khilaaf sajeesh kii?’’ jiesti lagu hone ke baad vastu evam jins kii keemton main vruddhi kii ashankaon ko khaarij karte hue vitt mantri ne kaha ki kar kii dar vartmaan str par rakhi jaayegi taaki iskaa mudrasphiti sambandhi prabhaav nahin pade
 Jaitley said that Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly will bring a legislation regarding GST
 unhone kaha ki jammu kashmir ke vitt mantri ne jiesti parishad kii sabhi baithkon ne bhaag liya he
 The Upper House rejected the amendment of Derek o'brien of the Trinamool Congress stating that all decisions of the GST Council should be approved by the Parliament
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) dhan vidheyak hone ke kaaran in chaaron vidheyakon par rajyasabha main keval charchaa karne kaa adhikaar tha
 The Lok Sabha has approved these Bills on 29 March
 vastu evam seva kar sambandhi vidheyakon par charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne vipaksh kii in ashankaon ko nirmul bataaya ki in vidheyakon ke jariye karadhaan ke maamle main sansad ke adhikaron ke saath samjhauta kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that the first thing is that by amending the constitution, this Parliament has given authority to recommend the rate of taxes to the GST Council
 jetali ne kaha ki jiesti parishad pehali sangheey nirnay karne vaali sanstha he
 The GST Council was given the authority to enact model legislation on the basis of constitutional amendment
 jahaan tak kanoon banane kii baat he to yah sangheey dhaanche ke aadhaar par hoga, vahiin sansad or rajya vidhansabhaon kii sarvocchata bani rahegi
 However, these recommendations have to be kept in mind because if different states decide different rates then chaotic situation will arise
 yah isaki sauhardrapurn vyakhya he or iskaa koi doosraa arth nahin nikaala janaa chahie
 He said that by amending the Constitution it has been ensured that this will be the only tax in the country which the states and the Center will collect together
 ek samaan kar banane kii bajaae kai kar dar hone ke bare main aapattiyon par sthiti spasht karte hue vitt mantri ne kaha ki kai khaadya utpaada hai jinpar abhi shunya kar lagata he or jiesti pranali lagu hone ke baad bhi koi kar nahin lagegaa
 There are many things that cannot be taxed at the same rate
 jaise tambaakoo, sharaab aadi kii daren oonchi hoti hai jabaki kapadon par saamaanya dar hoti he
 Jaitley said that during the discussion in the GST Council, it was decided that initially it would be easier to levy many taxes
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki jiesti parishad ne vichaar vimarsh ke baad jiesti vyavastha main 0, 5, 12, 18 or 28 pratishat kii daren tay kii hai
 There is also talk of imposing additional cess on luxury cars, bottled aerated beverages, harmful products like tobacco products and environmental related materials like coal
 unhone kaha ki 28 pratishat se adhik lagane vaala upkar (ses) muaavja kosh main jaayegaa or jin rajyon ko nuksaan ho rahaa he, unhen isamen se raashi di jaayegi
 There was also a suggestion that it should be taxed
 lekin kar ke rup main lagane se upabhoktaaon par prabhaav padataa
 However, no additional tax will be levied on consumers
 jetali ne kaha ki muaavja un rajyon ko diya jaayegaa jinhen jiesti pranali lagu hone se nuksaan ho rahaa ho
 This will be for the initial five years
 unhone kaha ki congress nit upie sarkaar ke dauraan isliye jiesti par aamasahmati nahin ban saki kyonki nuksaan vaale rajyon ko muaavje ke liye koi peshkash nahin kii gai thi
 The provision of compensation in GST helped in the deal and states came together
 jiesti main real estate kshetra ko shaamil nahin kiye jane par kai sadasyon kii aapatti par spashtikaran dete hue vitt mantri ne kaha ki yah ek aisa kshetra he jisamen rajyon ko kaaphi rajasav miltaa he
 It earns the states income from registry and other charges, hence it is not included in the GST based on the opinion of the states
 unhone yah bhi spasht kiya ki jiesti parishad main koi bhi faisla lene main centre kaa vot keval ek tihaai he jabaki do tihaai vot rajyon ko he
 Therefore, the Center is not in favor of imposing its opinion while making any decision
 vastu evam seva kar ko sanvaidhanik manjuuri praapt pehla sangheey anubandh qaraar dete hue jetali ne kaha ki upabhoktaaon par atirikt kar kaa bhaar nahin daalate hue jiesti ke madhyam se desh main ek raashtra, ek kar’ kii pranali lagu karne kaa maarg prashast hoga
 The Finance Minister said that the GST Council is unanimously deciding the tax structure and so far 12 meetings have been held in this regard
 yah vidheyak centre or rajya sarkaron ke bich sajhi samprabhutaa ke siddhant par aadhaarit he or yah aisi pehali pahal he
 After the implementation of GST, many other taxes including Central Excise, Service Tax and Value Added Tax (VAT) in states will be included in it
 jetali ne vidheyakon ko spasht karte hue kaha ki kendriya jiesti sambandhi vidheyak ke madhyam se utpaada, seva kar or atirikt seemaa shulk samaapt ho jane kii sthiti main centre ko kar lagane kaa adhikaar hoga
 The Center will have the right to tax the movement of goods and services in the states through the integrated GST or IGST
 kar chhot ke sambandh main munaafe kamaane se rokane ke upbandh ke bare main sthiti spasht karte hue vitt mantri ne kaha ki agar 4
 5 percent tax exemption is given then it does not mean that it should be considered as private profit but also its benefit should be given to the consumers
 is upbandh kaa aashay yahi he
 The Finance Minister said that like real estate, the situation was also with respect to alcohol and petroleum products
 rajyon ke saath charchaa ke baad petroleum padaarthon ko iske daayre main laayaa gaya he lekin ise abhi shunya dar ke tahat rakhaa gaya he
 This will be considered by the GST Council
 sharaab abhi bhi iske daayre se baahar he
 The Finance Minister said that earlier a person had to go to several evaluation agencies for business
 aarthik gatividhiyon ko aage badhaane ke liye utpaada shulk, seva kar, rajya waite, manaranjan kar, pravesh shulk, lakjri tex evam kai anya kar se guzarana padataa tha
 The Finance Minister said that there was no smooth flow of goods and severities in the country
 aise main jiesti pranali ko aage badhaayaa gaya
 a tax where there is an Assessing Officer
 adhiktar swa moolyankan ho or audit maamalon ko chhodkar keval simit moolyankan ho
 Jaitley said that tax is levied on taxes, which leads to inflation
 isliye saare desh ko ek bazaar banane kaa vichaar aayaa
 It was said that simple arrangements should be brought within the country
 krishi ko jiesti ke daayre main laane ko nirmul bataate hue vitt mantri ne kaha ki krishi evam krishak ko panjikaran kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Under section 23, farmers and agriculture are exempted
 isliye is chhot kii vyakhya ke liye paribhaasha main ise rakhaa gaya he
 There should be no confusion about this
 jetali ne kaha ki krishi utpaada jab shunya dar vaale hai tab is bare main koi bhram kii sthiti nahin honi chahie
 The comments is bare main congress kii aapattiyon ko khaarij karte hue jetali ne kaha ki 29 rajya, do centre shasit pradeshon or centre ne is par vichaar kiya jisamen congress shasit pradesh ke aath vitt mantri shaamil the
 Then did all of them together plot against a particular class? ”after the introduction of GST, the Finance Minister said that the tax rate will be kept at the current level so that its inflation will be ruled out
 No related effects
 jetali ne kaha ki jammu kashmir vidhansabha jiesti ke bare main apana ek vidhaan laaegi
 He said that the Finance Minister of Jammu and Kashmir has attended all the meetings of the GST Council
 ucch sadan ne trinmul congress ke derek o bryan kaa jo sanshodhan khaarij kiya usamen kaha gaya tha ki jiesti parishad ke sabhi faislon kii sansad se manjuuri dilvaayi jaani chahie

 He said that from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2018, 6 lakh 83 thousand 370 raids were conducted
 1 lakh 5 hajaar 954 abhiyojan darj kiye gaye or 1 lakh 27 hajaar 489 logon kii giraftaar kii gai

 BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad remains very conscious of his designation
 agar kabhi unke padnaam main gadabadi ho jaae to ve apana padnaam bataane se parhez nahin karte
 When he was the party's chief spokesperson and general secretary in Nitin Gadkari's team, the local media in-charge at the party's Mumbai executive introduced Ravi Shankar Prasad as the national spokesperson, before remembering that Prasad did not forget to start the party briefing
 The party also has national general secretary and senior advocate
 press conference main bhi agar unase koi kanoonee masale par sawaal poocha jaataa he to ve jawaab main vah yah jarur jodate hai ki “ek senior vakil hone ke naate main kahata hum
 
 
 
 
 During the press briefing on behalf of the party, they pay special attention to their designation in the official statement
 somvaar ko unhone party kii ore se aadhikarik brifing kii to vijyapti main baqayada yah joda gaya ki rajyasabha main vipaksh ke upanetaa kii ore se jari bayaan he
 Although the post of the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament is official, the Deputy Leader has no official post
 lekin partiyaan netaa vipaksh kii sahuuliyat ke liye kisi anya netaa ko yah jimmedaari detii he
 In this sense, Prasad was the Deputy Leader in the Rajya Sabha on behalf of the BJP Parliamentary Party, but in every statement he writes only the designation of Deputy Leader of the Opposition
 unka padnaam ke prati lagaav kai baar bhul kii vajah bhi ban jaati he
 It was mistakenly printed in a release issued by him as the chief spokesperson and general secretary, "some statements by the party's chief spokesperson and chief secretary general" and some senior party leaders also continue to pinch his fascination for this designation
 petrol-dijal kii keemten aasmaan chhu rahi hai
 Petrol price 55 month high level 74 in the capital Delhi
 50 prati litre tak pahunch gai he, to dijal bhi 65
 75 per liter has been reached
 inaki keemat kaa kareeb 50 fisadi kaa bada hissaa tex kaa hota he, isliye eendhan keemton par utpaada shulk sahit tamaam tex main katautee kii maang badhati ja rahi he
 But the Finance Ministry is against the excise duty or excise duty imposed by the central government
 vitt mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne somvaar ko yah jaankaree di
 On the other hand, the same central government is asking the bjp-ruled 21 state governments to cut the sales tax or VAT on petrol and diesel
 vitt mantralay ke adhikari ne kaha ki sarkaar ko yadi bajet ghate main katautee ke lakshya ko puraa karnaa he to exise duty main katautee kii salaah nahin di ja sakati
 He said, "excise duty reduction will be a political decision, but if we are to stick to the fiscal deficit target set in the budget then it cannot be advised
 'jaane kitna lagata he taxgauratlab he ki centre sarkaar petrol par prati litre 19
 Rs 48 and 15 per liter on diesel
 33 rupee kaa utpaada shulk lagaati he
 Apart from this, sales tax is levied by the states which is different in different states
 udhaaharan ke liye dilli main petrol par waite 15
 84 and VAT 9 on diesel
 68 rupee lagata he
 In this way, if we look in Delhi, the price of petrol here is 74
 50 prati litre main se kareeb 36 rupee kaa tex hi lag jaataa he
 The Finance Ministry official said, “the government incurs a loss of Rs 13,000 crore on every rupee reduction in excise duty on fuel
 ' unhone saaf kiya ki petroleummantralay seabhi aadhikarik rup se aisi kisi katautee kii baat nahin kii gai he
 Government this fiscal deficit to 3 of the GDP of the previous fiscal year

 Actor Anupam Kher has said that he has done 515 films in his 34-year career, but never worked as hard as he did for Manmohan Singh's character in 'the Accidental Prime Minister'
 vajah ki manmohan singh shant swabhaav ke vyakti hai
 He does not keep expression
 har samay unke chehre par ek jaise bhav rahete hai, magar filmon main to bina abhivyakti ke kuch nahin ho saktaa
 Secondly, Manmohan Singh is the leader of today
 aise main unki bhoomika nibhaana zyada chunauteepurn rahaa, kyonki log manmohan singh ko aaj bhi dekhte hai
 If i would have done anything wrong to play his role, people would have made various comments, like - where does Manmohan Singh walk like this, or where he speaks in this way

 Realizing how important Rajasthan is going to play in the coming days, India Today opened its Jaipur bureau in 1997
 desh main sabase bade kshetrafal vaala yah rajya kai vajahon se duniyabar main apane prati dilchaspee jagaata he, iske baavjood yah ek aisi jagah he jiskaa puri kshamta se ab tak dohan nahin ho sakaa he
 The people of Rajasthan have a strong will for the well being of their country, state and their family
 baavjood iske rajya main unhen tarakkee ke avasaron se vanchit hona padataa he yaa phir ve uplabdh sansadhano kaa purna dohan kar paane main aksham rahete hai
 Some people blame the feudal mindset
 lekin acha pradarshan na kar paane kaa yah koi bahaanaa nahin ho saktaa, kyonki 70 saal kaa loktantr aguai ke liye paryaapt vakt detaa he
 Fighting backward social indices and poverty, the state has established itself as a wonderful place for tourists and has also made the lives of people living here happy
 rajasthan main hona sukhad he, chaahe aap kitni bhi der rahen
 This state is full of diversified activities and is gearing up for rapid progress
 india today kaa rajasthan par kendrit visheshank is rajya ke sarvshereshth ko saamne laane kaa ek prayaas he
 We urged 12 experts from different fields to write one article each
 har aalekh is rajya kii ek jhaanki kii tarah he
 This has made it easier to sort the best in every category
 rajya ke bare main unke gyaan kaa bhi isse bakhubi pataa lagata he
 There is so much to see, buy, eat and eat here that one-time travel is not going to happen, you have to come here again and again
 rajasthan kaa in kshetron main koi jod nahin he
 It is a historical place where every small and big thing has a past
 inamen koi raja, koi pakwaan, bhawan, devtaa, dharmik sthal, hastshilp, tyohaar, mela or yahaan tak ki pagadi jaisi choti cheez bhi ho sakati he
 For those who have not seen Rajasthan, it is a desert, but the reality is that despite the lack of water, this state is very beautiful in terms of greenery and lakes
 iske teen ahm shahar udaipur, jodhpur or jaipur vimaan seva se jude hue hai or inkaa rail sampark bhi acha he
 If you want to enjoy this state realistically, then it can be taken by road only
 rajasthan ke rajmargon par gaadi chalaanaa sukhad anubhav he or rajasthan ko dekhne kaa yah sarvshereshth tarika he
 However, driving inside the cities can prove to be a bad experience, as traffic management is very poor and there are parking problems
 baavjood iske, vah bhi aapke anubhav kaa ek hissaa hi hoga
 Rajasthan is a predominantly vegetarian state, but there has been a change in food in the last twenty years
 jodhpur jaisi jagahon par log acha khaanaa pakaate hai or bahut din nahin hue jab log shaayad hi baahar khaane jaaya karte the
 Now this trend has changed
 shahar main alag-alag pakwaanon kii peshkash karne vaale restaraan maujuud hai or logon kii bheed vahaan juty rahati he
 Malls and multiplexes have grown like mushrooms, creating a food court culture
 kuch bade hotalon ne bhi apane restaraan par kaaphi dhyaan diya he taaki log vahaan aa saken
 Some hotels serve pure Vaishnav food while heritage hotels offer all types of food, especially non-vegetarian
 yahaan sadakon par kharidari karnaa hameshaa se sukhad rahaa he lekin ab mahangi chijen khareednaa bhi sambhav ho gaya he
 You can get both types of things from the street to the mall, where now in addition to the showroom, kiosks have also been installed
 rajasthan kii jalwaayu garam he lekin yahaan saal bhar anand liya ja saktaa he
 Forts and princely forests can be enjoyed in the morning in the summer
 dopaher main aaraam kar ke shaam ko bazaar-haat kiya ja saktaa he or raat ke khaane ke baad shahar main nite drive kaa anand bhi uthaaya ja saktaa he
 If a city is really to be seen, then after ten o'clock at night when the traffic is reduced, then driving in any major city of the state is a real pleasure
 rajasthan ko dekhne-samajhane ke liye chaar hakrate kii yatra se kam main kaam nahin chalegaa
 Frequent trips can also be made
 yahaan ke melon-tyoharon ke dauraan yahaan hona sukhad he
 The natural beauty and wildlife here is unmatched
 alag-alag jagahon kii pahchaan kar ke aap har baar ek nayaa anubhav le sakate hai
 Just need an excuse to come here
 aap chahen to kisi mandir yaa dargah ke liye nikal sakate hai, kisi smarak ke liye yaa phir acha bhojan or kharidari ke bahaane yahaan aa sakate hai
 It is also a good excuse to stay in the luxurious hotels, enjoy folk dances and camel safaris, boating in the lake, spend the night on the dhows, meet with the royal people, see the army villages, or hang out with the sheep herders
 is
 aap chahen to hill stesan ke liye bhi yahaan aa sakate hai
 It is also pleasant to see museums built in luxurious palaces
 rajya main pravesh ke kai bindu hai or yah tamaam jagahon se sampark margon se judaa hua he
 Each corner here looks different from the other
 rajya main harappakalin jagahen bhi hai or gupt kaal ke smarak tathaa buddha gufaaon ke avshesh bhi hai
 The fort of Chittorgarh has so many historical things that it can be termed like the Roman Empire
 yahaan ek bhi pal aapako ub nahin hoti
 The folk songs here are melodious and the folk dances force the dancing
 duniya bhar ke photographeron kii yah pehali pasand he
 Every type of wildlife is present here
 uunton kaa jattha, bhedon-bakriyon kaa revad, bandar or pravasi pakshiyon kaa asaamanya jagahon par jutan photographeron ke liye sukhad avasar hota he
 Efforts are constantly made to maintain religious places and monuments here so that millions of tourists do not face any problem
 yahaan puraane smarakon ke chalate puratathvik yatraaen bhi yojit kii jaati hai
 In recent years, the number of domestic tourists has increased considerably here
 yahaan ke koching sansthaanon or anya shaikshanik sansthaanon main duusare rajyon ke adhyayanrat chaatr is rajya kii khubsuurati or bhavyata kaa sandesh prasaarit kar rahe hai
 Rajasthan did not have good educational institutions for a long time, except for the Empress Gayatri Devi or Sawai Man Singh or St
 Xavier schools, which started Rajmata Gayatri Devi
 ab yah sthiti badal rahi he
 Many good schools, colleges and universities are opening here
 kota or anya jagahon par koching sansthaanon kii bharmaar ho gai he
 Aquas, IIT, ISRO, CAZRI, Camel Breeding Farm and iims have now opened in the state
 yahaan kai ejineering college khul chuke hai
 The literacy rate of the state has also increased and children of villages are now happily studying in schools
 rajya kaa maahaul kaaphi shant he
 It is famous for its communal and caste harmony
 har jati or dharm ne rajya kii tarakkee main yogadan diya he
 This is the reason that whether it is solar energy or wind or labor intensive industries, digital technology focused units and setting up of call centers, investors are getting attracted here
 chikitsa ke kshetra main bhi yahaan behtareen suvidhaayen maujuud hai
 Medical facilities are also progressing along rural and urban roads
 rajya main ang pratyaropan bhi ab uplabdh ho chukaa he
 After the setting up of the oil refinery and power plant, a new story of growth and entrepreneurship is being written in Barmer
 isse yahaan ke yuva rojgaar ke maamle main kaaphi labhanvit hue hai
 Today, olive cultivation is successful in the state
 yahaan kalakaaron ke liye behad anukool maahaul he
 Due to long distances and frequent droughts in the state, its governance is difficult, but the government and the public together have found new ways to meet these challenges
 yahi vah takat he jisane din-ba-din rajya ko lagaataar ubharne main madad kii he or is laayak banaaya he ki vah aaj kii taarikh main kisi kaa bhi sarvshereshth swaagat karne ko taiyaar he

 Many questions raised by the US Senators letter on the issue of Kashmir on Donald Trump's condemnation of Pakistan's stance, not only india-pakistan on Jammu and Kashmir issue but also in US politics
 america ke chaar senetters ne jammu-kashmir ke masale par raashtrapati donald trump ko chitthee likhi he
 The Senators have written a letter demanding that the US President should talk to India and ask for the removal of restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir
 iske alaava donald trump se ye bhi apil kii gai he ki jammu-kashmir main jin logon ko hiraasat main liya gaya he unhen bhi reeha karnaa chahie
 Senators Chris Van Hollon, Todd Young, Ben Cardin and Lindsey Graham are among those writing letters to US President Donald Trump
 isi chitthee main sabhi ne apil kii he ki pakistan ko aatankwaad kaa saath dena band karnaa chahie, kashmir ko lekar kisi bhi kadam uthaane se pehle kai baar sochna chahie
 The senators have written that Donald Trump should talk about telephone ban in Jammu and Kashmir, removal of curfew by talking to Narendra Modi
 iske alaava bhi congressman (saansad) erik swalewel ne bhi is masale par likhaa he ki jammu-kashmir kaa masalaa sirf bharat-pakistan kaa nahin he, balki puri duniya kaa he
 Because it is going to affect the world economy, military power
 aapako bataa den ki jammu-kashmir ke masale par donald trump kai baar bayaan de chuke hai or madhyasthata kii baat kah chuke hai
 However, there has been much controversy over this as India has always been saying that this issue is bilateral
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi donald trump ke saamne kaha tha ki bharat-paak main jo bhi vivaad hai vah donon desh aapas main sulajhaa sakate hai
 In such a situation, no third country should enter it

 At the moment the team is enjoying, they are playing football, they are happy

 He said, 'the bowler deserves all the credit
 paanch maichon main 50 wicket yah shandaar uplabdhi he
 Many times the performance of the batsmen dominates their performance and they do not get credit, but it is good to see that the bowlers are getting credit
 'team india ke abhiyaan ke bare main shastri ne kaha ki australia ke khilaaf siries main kharaab pradarshan ke baad world cap jeetne kaa team ko bharosa he
 He said, 'we have not come here just to increase the number
 ham apane kisi bhi virdohi ko koi mauka nahin dena chaahate or ham trophy jeetenge

 train to hameshaa hi der chalati rahi he, to kya isi kaaran yah sawaal poochna band kar diya jaae ki train let kyon chal rahi he
 At this time there is not even a mist nor the number of special trains has increased due to Teej festivals, yet why many trains are running late by twenty to thirty hours
 kya in railgadiyon main safar karne vaale yatriyon ke samay kii koi keemat nahin
 Think in terms of media
 kisi din bees hawaii jahaaz chaar se das ghante der se ude us din channelon par tufaan much jaataa he
 There was an outcry, but why is this and how long will it be that the train will run late and we should not question
 lakhon log rose is deree ke kaaran jhunjhalaate hue utarate hai or phir saamaanya ho jate hai
 Nobody compensates for the loss of money from their work
 hamane swatantraaa senaanee express kii baat kii
 An error has occurred
 pehle bataaya tha ki yah train bihar ke jai nagar se anand vihaar tak chalati he magar anand vihaar nahin yah nai dilli se chalati he or jayanagar tak jaati he
 This train running in the name of freedom fighters should have at least such a recognition that it should run normally
 12561 number kii swatantraaa senaanee express ko do may kii dopaher do baje jayanagar se dilli ke liye ravaanaa hona tha
 But this train opens from Jayanagar, at 2 o'clock in the morning of May 3, at 20 minutes i
e
 12 hours late
 teen may ko ise nai dilli railway stesan par saadhe baarah baje pahunchnaa tha, magar kaarykram shuru hone tak yah nahin pahunchi thi
 The departure time of train number 12562 from Delhi to Jayanagar on 2 May was 8:40 pm
 website se pataa chal rahaa he ki yah train do may ko nahin, teen may kii raat 9 bajkar 30 minute par khulegi yani 24 ghante let he
 The 2 May train is opening on 3 May and the 3 May train will open on 4 May
 hamaare sahyogi pramod gupta 3 may kii shaam saadhe paanch baje darbhanga stesan gaye
 It was found that 12561 number freedom fighter express coming from Delhi to Darbhanga is late for 24 hours
 isi train ko waapas jayanagar se dilli ke liye janaa he
 At that time, it was told that now this train will leave at 3 o'clock in the morning instead of 3 o'clock in the morning, ie, it will open with a delay of 12 hours
 hamaare sahyogi pramod gupta ek video bheja he
 Freedom fighter coming to Darbhanga from Delhi is entering the express station
 is train ko 2 may kii shaam saadhe paanch baje darambhaga aana tha magar yah 3 may ko pahunch rahi he vah bhi paune saat baje
 That is, Darbhanga has been delayed by more than 24 hours
 ab isi ko jayanagar janaa he or vahaan se taiyaar hokar waapas dilli ke liye ravaanaa hona he
 If you imagine the stress of the passengers, then you will know the importance of this report
 pramod gupta ne bataaya ki yah train 11 sitambar 2015 ko pehali baar chali thi
 Since then, it is known for not running on time
 kai baar samastipur mandal is train ko cancel kar samay se chalaane kaa prayaas bhi karata he to bhi yah train waapas 5 ghante se lekar 22 ghante kii deree se chalane lagati he
 Passengers at Darbhanga station are troubled by asking when the Freedom Fighter Express will arrive, when it will leave
 gaanvon se aakar log platform par das-das baarah-baarah ghante baithe rahete hai
 Is there any value for their time? railway to inhen ek glass pani bhi nahin pilaataa hoga
 Here, passengers waited for several hours at the New Delhi railway station, both for the train coming from Jayanagar and going to Jayanagar
 ek yatri ko 2 may ke swatantraaa senaanee express se jayanagar ke liye janaa tha or ek yatri ko 3 may ke swatantraaa senaanee express se janaa tha
 Both confuse were sitting that the train on May 2 will go today or the train on May 3 will come
 3 may ko nai dilli stesan par jayanagar se aane vaali swatantraaa senaanee express shaam 6 bajkar 35 minute par ai he
 This train was supposed to arrive at half past two on the day of May 2
 ai he 30 ghante kii deree se
 Imagine if some freedom fighters are traveling in this train, and the passengers sitting with them are repeatedly cursing the name of this train that it is late for 20 hours and 24 hours
 koi is train kaa maai baap hi nahin he to un swatantraaa senaanee ko kitna bura lagata hoga
 Would have thought that it would have been better if the train could not run in the name of us
 yah swatantraaa senaniyon kaa apmaan he ki unke naam se bani train kabhi samay se nahin chalati he
 Can Railway Minister Piyush Goyal show this train running on time
 
 
 hamane yah tay kiya he ki jab tak swatantra bharat main swatantraaa senaanee express samay se nahin chalegi prime time main har din iskaa zikr karuunga
 The experiences of passengers boarding this train are frightening
 ek yatri ne hamen messej kiya ki ve is train se aksar dilli se madhubani jate hai magar saal ke 12 maheene yah train 12 se 18 ghante kii deree se to chalati hi he
 Kshitij Mohan traveled by this train on 6 October 2016, has also sent a screen shot of the running status of that day
 unka kahana he ki tab yah train 31 ghante kii deree se chal rahi thi
 He says that he will save this screen shot all his life
 aise bhi jaagruk yatri hote hai
 Another passenger Mrityunjaya Jha had booked a ticket for his family members on June 1, checking the status of this train daily, but got upset with the habit of walking late and canceled the ticket itself
 inhen is baat kaa yakeen tha ki train let hogi hi hogi
 We want this train to run on time from Monday and the family of Mrityunjay ji will be cut again and Darbhanga with this train
 mrityunjay kii baat sahi he ki is train se kaam karne vaale mehanatakash log chalate hai
 For them, one day delay means one more holiday and one vacation cut, then the month's salary will be reduced
 agar pradhanmantri khud ko kaamadaar kehete hai to kamgaaron ko lekar chalane vaali train kabhi let nahin honi chahie
 When Railway Minister Piyush Goyal gets the Freedom Fighter Express run on time, then we will give the challenge of running the second train on time which is running late by 20-20 hours
 hamaare sahyogi saleem ne gorakhpur mandal ke mukhya jansampark adhikari sanjay yadav se baatcheet kii ki kitni gaadiyaan deree se chal rahi hai
 He said that in the month of April, about 5045 trains were run, of which 2,182 trains were late
 ek minute se lekar zyada let maani gayi
 They gave the reason that they are driving more trains than their capacity
 rakrakhaav ke kaam ho rahe hai is vajah se bhi deree he
 But is this delay only today? pichley kai maheene se kai railgadiyaan deree se chal rahi hai
 According to the passengers, the Freedom Fighter Express has never run in time, which passes through this route
 saleem ne gorakhpur railway stesan par intazaar kar rahe kuch yatriyon se baat kii
 Some have to go to Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, some have to go to Ankleshwar and some have Surat
 koi 12 ghante se stesan par intazaar kar rahaa he to saat se aath ghante se
 The Avadh Assam Express is running late by 18 hours
 stesan saaf suthra he magar train ke chalane kaa samay vahi he jo kabhi tha jo shaayad hameshaa se hi rahaa hoga
 If we ask the reason for the delay, it is said that this time the accident rates have come down drastically, but it shows the improvement in the railway's efficiency
 iskaa matlab yah kaise ho jayega ki train kii raftaar 30 ghante deree se kar den or phir daawa karen ki durghatana kii daron main kami ai he
 Film director Anubhav Sinha decided to travel by rail after thirty years
 unhone twit kiya ki 30 saal baad bhi kuch nahin badla he

 29 april ko nilachal express kaa tikat liya
 This train was supposed to leave from Lucknow at 2:30 pm but lasted at 12 noon
 das ghante kii deree se ve varanasi pahunchate hai
 Tweet that big things on TV are all lies
 hindustan kaa sach hindustan se hi chupa hua he
 The comments gaadi nan
 12487 Seemanchal Express runs from Jogbani in Araria district of Bihar and reaches Anand Vihar
 1 may ko yah train 22 ghante 15 minute kii deree se khuli he
 The Railway Inquiry website states that this train will reach Anand Vihar with a delay of 1 day 3 hours 8 minutes i
e
 27 hours late
 in railgadiyon main chalane vaale yatriyon ke samay kii keemat hoti to der se chalane kii is beemaari ko dur kar diya jaataa
 Travelers can tolerate four to five hours, but how will they explain the delay of 20 hours and 27 hours
 isi tarah patna kota express 24 ghante kii deree se chalati he
 Who is to be held responsible for this delay? If the railway minister is dynamic, then why are the trains not dynamic? Why do all these trains run late by 20 hours and 24 hours? These railway series did not run like a job series
 kai trene hai jo chah se das ghante kii deree se bhi chal rahi hai
 At least the railways should compensate passengers for the delay of 24 hours

 One passenger had to leave for Jayanagar from the Freedom Fighter Express of 2 May and a passenger from the Freedom Fighter Express from 3 May
 donon kanphyus baithe the ki 2 may vaali train aaj jaaegi yaa 3 may vaali train aa jaaegi
 On May 3, the freedom fighter Express from Jayanagar at New Delhi station arrived at 6
35 pm
 is train ko do may ke din dopaher saadhe baje aana tha
 Has come late by 30 hours
 sochie is train main agar koi swatantraaa senaanee safar kar rahe hon, or unke saath baithe yatri baar-baar is train kaa naam lekar kos rahe hon ki 20 ghante 24 ghante let rahati he
 No one is the mother father of this train, then how bad would those freedom fighters feel
 sochate honge ki acha hota ham logon ke naam se train hi nahin chalati
 It is an insult to freedom fighters that a train named after them never runs on time
 kya rail mantri piyush goyal is train ko samay se chalaa kar dikhaa sakate hai
 
 
 We have decided that i will mention it every day in prime time until the Freedom Fighter Express runs in independent India
 is train main chalane vaale yatriyon ke anubhav bhayaavah hai
 a passenger messaged us that they often go to Madhubani from Delhi by this train but 12 months of the year, this train runs at a delay of 12 to 18 hours
 kshitij mohan ne 6 oktober 2016 ko is train se yatra kii thi, us din ke running states kaa screen shot bhi bheja he
 He says that then this train was running late by 31 hours
 unka kahana he ki ve is screen shot ko puri zindagi sahej kar rakhenge
 Such are also aware travelers
 ek or yatri mrityujny jha ne apane parivaar ke logon ke liye 1 june kaa tikat kataaya tha, rose is train kaa states check kar rahe the, magar iske let chalane kii aadat se pareshaan ho gaye or tikat hi cancil kara diya
 He was sure that the train would be late
 ham chaahate hai ki somvaar se yah train samay par chalane lage or mrityunjay ji kaa parivaar dobaaraa tikat kataa kar isi train se darbhanga jaae
 Mrityunjaya is right that the working people on this train work
 unke liye ek din kii deree kaa matlab he ek or chuttee or ek chuttee kati to maheene kaa vetan kam ho jayega
 If the Prime Minister calls himself a Kamdar, then the train carrying workers should never be late
 jab rail mantri piyush goyal swatantraaa senaanee express ko samay se chalava denge tab ham duusari train ko samay se chalavane kaa chalange denge jo 20-20 ghante kii deree se chal rahi hai
 Our colleague Salim spoke to Gorakhpur Division Chief Public Relations Officer Sanjay Yadav about how many trains were running late
 unhone bataaya ki april ke maheene main lagbhag 5045 trainen chalaai gayi jisamen se 2,182 gaadiyaan let huin
 More than a minute was considered late
 inhone kaaran bataaya ki apni kshamta se zyaada rail gaadiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 There is also a delay due to the maintenance work being done
 lekin kya yah deree sirf aaj kii he
 For the past several months, many trains have been running late
 yatriyon kii maane to swatantraaa senaanee express kabhi samay se hi nahin chali jo isi root se guzarati he
 Salim spoke to some passengers waiting at Gorakhpur railway station
 kisi ko rajasthan ke hanumangarh janaa he, kisi ko ankleshwar janaa he to kisi ko surat
 Someone is waiting at the station for 12 hours, then for seven to eight hours
 avadh assam express 18 ghante kii deree se chal rahi he
 The station is clean but the running time of the train is the same as it once was, which may have been there forever
 deree kaa kaaran puuchhie to zarur bataaya jaataa he ki is baar durghatana kii daron main bahut hi kami ai he lekin yah to railway kii kshamta main sudhaar bataata he
 How would it mean to delay the speed of the train by 30 hours and then claim that the accident rates have come down
 film nirdeshak anubhav sinha ne tees saal baad rail yatra karne kaa faisla kiya
 He tweeted that nothing has changed even after 30 years
 unhone tay kiya ki lakhanu se varanasi train se chalate hai
 Took ticket for Neelachal Express on 29th April
 is train ko lakhanu se dopaher dhai baje ravaanaa hona tha magar chali raat ke 12 baje
 They reach Varanasi with a delay of ten hours
 twit karte hai ki tivi par badi badi baaten sab jhooth hai
 The truth of Hindustan is hidden from India itself
 tippaniyan Train no
 12487 simanchal express bihar ke arriya zile ke jogbani se chalati he or anand vihaar tak aati he
 On May 1, the train opened 22 hours and 15 minutes late
 railway inquairi kii website bataati he ki yah train 1 din 3 ghanta 8 minute kii deree se anand vihaar pahonchegi yani 27 ghante kii deree se
 If the cost of the time of passengers traveling in these trains would have been worth it, this disease of running late would have been eradicated
 chaar paanch ghante to yatri bardaasht kar lete hai magar 20 ghante or 27 ghante kii deree ko wo kaise samajhaayenge
 Similarly, Patna Kota Express runs late by 24 hours
 is deree ke liye kise zimmedaar tehraaya jaae? agar rail mantri dinemic hai to rail gaadiyaan kyon nahin dinemic hai? ye sari trainen kyon 20 ghante 24 ghante kii deree se chalati hai? naukari series kii tarah kahin ye railway series na chal pade
 There are many trains which are running late by six to ten hours
 kam se kam railway ko 24 ghante kii deree hone par yatriyon ko muawza dena chahie
 We showed the struggle of 12,460 BTC teachers of UP several times
 unhone apane sangharsh se badi kamyaabi hasil kii he
 He was not getting the appointment letter even after winning his case several times from the court
 jab andolan tej kiya to yogi sarkaar ko kahana padaa ki niyukti patr denge or niyukti patr dene kii prakriya shuru ho gai
 Many have found and many are getting
 in sabane prime time ke prati aabhaar vyakt kiya he
 We hope that they will make very good teachers
 yah sahi he ki hamane kai baar dikhaaya magar asli sangharsh inhen logon kaa tha
 The same people kept fighting with each other for months in a court battle, eating sticks on the streets
 aap bhi inhen badhai dijie taaki inkaa utsaah bana rahe
 Now the second battle is whether the system of pension will be able to get back to the people, depending on how much the fighters fight
 iske liye sarkari karmchaariyon ko naitik bal or aatm bal kaa vikaas karnaa hoga
 Imagine if some freedom fighters are traveling in this train, and the passengers sitting with them are repeatedly cursing the name of this train that it is late for 20 hours and 24 hours
 koi is train kaa maai baap hi nahin he to un swatantraaa senaanee ko kitna bura lagata hoga
 Would have thought that it would have been better if the train could not run in the name of us
 yah swatantraaa senaniyon kaa apmaan he ki unke naam se bani train kabhi samay se nahin chalati he
 Can Railway Minister Piyush Goyal show this train running on time
 
 
 hamane yah tay kiya he ki jab tak swatantra bharat main swatantraaa senaanee express samay se nahin chalegi prime time main har din iskaa zikr karuunga
 The experiences of passengers boarding this train are frightening
 ek yatri ne hamen messej kiya ki ve is train se aksar dilli se madhubani jate hai magar saal ke 12 maheene yah train 12 se 18 ghante kii deree se to chalati hi he
 Kshitij Mohan traveled by this train on 6 October 2016, has also sent a screen shot of the running status of that day
 unka kahana he ki tab yah train 31 ghante kii deree se chal rahi thi
 He says that he will save this screen shot all his life
 aise bhi jaagruk yatri hote hai
 Another passenger Mrityunjaya Jha had booked a ticket for his family members on June 1, checking the status of this train daily, but got upset with the habit of walking late and canceled the ticket itself
 inhen is baat kaa yakeen tha ki train let hogi hi hogi
 We want this train to run on time from Monday and the family of Mrityunjay ji will be cut again and Darbhanga with this train
 mrityunjay kii baat sahi he ki is train se kaam karne vaale mehanatakash log chalate hai
 For them, one day delay means one more holiday and one vacation cut, then the month's salary will be reduced
 agar pradhanmantri khud ko kaamadaar kehete hai to kamgaaron ko lekar chalane vaali train kabhi let nahin honi chahie
 When Railway Minister Piyush Goyal gets the Freedom Fighter Express run on time, then we will give the challenge of running the second train on time which is running late by 20-20 hours
 hamaare sahyogi saleem ne gorakhpur mandal ke mukhya jansampark adhikari sanjay yadav se baatcheet kii ki kitni gaadiyaan deree se chal rahi hai
 He said that in the month of April, about 5045 trains were run, of which 2,182 trains were late
 ek minute se lekar zyada let maani gayi
 They gave the reason that they are driving more trains than their capacity
 rakrakhaav ke kaam ho rahe hai is vajah se bhi deree he
 But is this delay only today? pichley kai maheene se kai railgadiyaan deree se chal rahi hai
 According to the passengers, the Freedom Fighter Express has never run in time, which passes through this route
 saleem ne gorakhpur railway stesan par intazaar kar rahe kuch yatriyon se baat kii
 Some have to go to Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, some have to go to Ankleshwar and some have Surat
 koi 12 ghante se stesan par intazaar kar rahaa he to saat se aath ghante se
 The Avadh Assam Express is running late by 18 hours
 stesan saaf suthra he magar train ke chalane kaa samay vahi he jo kabhi tha jo shaayad hameshaa se hi rahaa hoga
 If we ask the reason for the delay, it is said that this time the accident rates have come down drastically, but it shows the improvement in the railway's efficiency
 iskaa matlab yah kaise ho jayega ki train kii raftaar 30 ghante deree se kar den or phir daawa karen ki durghatana kii daron main kami ai he
 Film director Anubhav Sinha decided to travel by rail after thirty years
 unhone twit kiya ki 30 saal baad bhi kuch nahin badla he
 He decided that from Lucknow to Varanasi train
 29 april ko nilachal express kaa tikat liya
 This train was supposed to leave from Lucknow at 2:30 pm but lasted at 12 noon
 das ghante kii deree se ve varanasi pahunchate hai
 Tweet that big things on TV are all lies
 hindustan kaa sach hindustan se hi chupa hua he
 The comments gaadi nan
 12487 Seemanchal Express runs from Jogbani in Araria district of Bihar and reaches Anand Vihar
 1 may ko yah train 22 ghante 15 minute kii deree se khuli he
 The Railway Inquiry website states that this train will reach Anand Vihar with a delay of 1 day 3 hours 8 minutes i
e
 27 hours late
 in railgadiyon main chalane vaale yatriyon ke samay kii keemat hoti to der se chalane kii is beemaari ko dur kar diya jaataa
 Travelers can tolerate four to five hours, but how will they explain the delay of 20 hours and 27 hours
 isi tarah patna kota express 24 ghante kii deree se chalati he
 Who is to be held responsible for this delay? If the railway minister is dynamic, then why are the trains not dynamic? Why do all these trains run late by 20 hours and 24 hours? These railway series did not run like a job series
 kai trene hai jo chah se das ghante kii deree se bhi chal rahi hai
 At least the railways should compensate passengers for the delay of 24 hours
 hamane upi ke 12,460 beatisi shikshakon ke sangharsh ko kai baar dikhaaya
 He has achieved great success through his struggle
 adaalat se kai baar apana cese jeetne ke baad bhi unhen niyukti patr nahin mil rahaa tha
 When the movement intensified, Yogi Sarkar had to say that he would give appointment letters and the process of giving appointment letters started
 bahuton ko mil gai he or bahuton ko mil rahi he
 All of them have expressed their gratitude for prime time
 ham ummid karte hai ki ye bahut achche shikshak banenge
 It is true that we showed many times but the real struggle was with these people
 yahi log aapas main chanda karke maheenon adalati ladaai ladate rahe, sadakon par laathiyaan khate rahe
 Congratulate them too so that their enthusiasm remains
 ab duusari ladaai he ki kya pension kii vyavastha logon ko waapas mil sakegi, nirbhar karata he ladane vaale kitna ladate hai
 For this government employees will have to develop moral strength and self-power
 kshitij mohan ne 6 oktober 2016 ko is train se yatra kii thi, us din ke running states kaa screen shot bhi bheja he
 He says that then this train was running late by 31 hours
 unka kahana he ki ve is screen shot ko puri zindagi sahej kar rakhenge
 Such are also aware travelers
 ek or yatri mrityujny jha ne apane parivaar ke logon ke liye 1 june kaa tikat kataaya tha, rose is train kaa states check kar rahe the, magar iske let chalane kii aadat se pareshaan ho gaye or tikat hi cancil kara diya
 He was sure that the train would be late
 ham chaahate hai ki somvaar se yah train samay par chalane lage or mrityunjay ji kaa parivaar dobaaraa tikat kataa kar isi train se darbhanga jaae
 Mrityunjaya is right that the working people on this train work
 unke liye ek din kii deree kaa matlab he ek or chuttee or ek chuttee kati to maheene kaa vetan kam ho jayega
 If the Prime Minister calls himself a Kamdar, then the train carrying workers should never be late
 jab rail mantri piyush goyal swatantraaa senaanee express ko samay se chalava denge tab ham duusari train ko samay se chalavane kaa chalange denge jo 20-20 ghante kii deree se chal rahi hai
 Our colleague Salim spoke to Gorakhpur Division Chief Public Relations Officer Sanjay Yadav about how many trains were running late
 unhone bataaya ki april ke maheene main lagbhag 5045 trainen chalaai gayi jisamen se 2,182 gaadiyaan let huin
 More than a minute was considered late
 inhone kaaran bataaya ki apni kshamta se zyaada rail gaadiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 There is also a delay due to the maintenance work being done
 lekin kya yah deree sirf aaj kii he
 For the past several months, many trains have been running late
 yatriyon kii maane to swatantraaa senaanee express kabhi samay se hi nahin chali jo isi root se guzarati he
 Salim spoke to some passengers waiting at Gorakhpur railway station
 kisi ko rajasthan ke hanumangarh janaa he, kisi ko ankleshwar janaa he to kisi ko surat
 Someone is waiting at the station for 12 hours, then for seven to eight hours
 avadh assam express 18 ghante kii deree se chal rahi he
 The station is clean but the running time of the train is the same as it once was, which may have been there forever
 deree kaa kaaran puuchhie to zarur bataaya jaataa he ki is baar durghatana kii daron main bahut hi kami ai he lekin yah to railway kii kshamta main sudhaar bataata he
 How would it mean to delay the speed of the train by 30 hours and then claim that the accident rates have come down
 film nirdeshak anubhav sinha ne tees saal baad rail yatra karne kaa faisla kiya
 He tweeted that nothing has changed even after 30 years
 unhone tay kiya ki lakhanu se varanasi train se chalate hai
 Took ticket for Neelachal Express on 29th April
 is train ko lakhanu se dopaher dhai baje ravaanaa hona tha magar chali raat ke 12 baje
 They reach Varanasi with a delay of ten hours

 On May 1, the train opened 22 hours and 15 minutes late
 railway inquairi kii website bataati he ki yah train 1 din 3 ghanta 8 minute kii deree se anand vihaar pahonchegi yani 27 ghante kii deree se
 If the cost of the time of passengers traveling in these trains would have been worth it, this disease of running late would have been eradicated
 chaar paanch ghante to yatri bardaasht kar lete hai magar 20 ghante or 27 ghante kii deree ko wo kaise samajhaayenge
 Similarly, Patna Kota Express runs late by 24 hours
 is deree ke liye kise zimmedaar tehraaya jaae? agar rail mantri dinemic hai to rail gaadiyaan kyon nahin dinemic hai? ye sari trainen kyon 20 ghante 24 ghante kii deree se chalati hai? naukari series kii tarah kahin ye railway series na chal pade
 There are many trains which are running late by six to ten hours
 kam se kam railway ko 24 ghante kii deree hone par yatriyon ko muawza dena chahie
 We showed the struggle of 12,460 BTC teachers of UP several times
 unhone apane sangharsh se badi kamyaabi hasil kii he
 He was not getting the appointment letter even after winning his case several times from the court
 jab andolan tej kiya to yogi sarkaar ko kahana padaa ki niyukti patr denge or niyukti patr dene kii prakriya shuru ho gai
 Many have found and many are getting

 We hope that they will make very good teachers
 yah sahi he ki hamane kai baar dikhaaya magar asli sangharsh inhen logon kaa tha
 The same people kept fighting with each other for months in a court battle, eating sticks on the streets
 aap bhi inhen badhai dijie taaki inkaa utsaah bana rahe
 Now the second battle is whether the system of pension will be able to get back to the people, depending on how much the fighters fight
 iske liye sarkari karmchaariyon ko naitik bal or aatm bal kaa vikaas karnaa hoga

 The Chief Minister said jokingly, 'I have a complaint to Giriraj ji that he did not feed me a birthday cake
 ’somvaar ko isse pehle bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii bihar ikai ne patna main narendra modi kaa janmdin manaaya
 In this sequence, Animal Husbandry Minister of Bihar Government Giriraj Singh also cut the cake

 Shiba said that experts have been consulted for this so that there is no harm to them by touching them

 But those who think so should know about Vimal Patel once
 jinhone aaj apni mehnat ke dam par 100 karod kii company khadi kar di he
 13 year old Shubham becomes Little Tiger of GOLF world, know how he is, Vimal Patel Vimal, who hails from Anand district of Gujarat, was not good at reading
 jis vajah se vah 7veen kaksha main fail ho gaye
 Vimal, who belongs to a middle family, used to hear that he would not be able to achieve anything in life
 kaksha main fail ho jane ke baad unke mata-pita ne kaha ki ve ghar se chale jaaen or khud kamakar apni jindagi chalaaen
 Please tell that after coming from school, Vimal used to roam with friends
 vahiin is dauraan unhone pita se ratnon kii polish karne kaa kaam sikh liya tha
 This engineer left a package of millions, started the task of selling tea, the day was filled with struggle, a child who is not good in studies, the biggest challenge was what to do next? How to earn money In 1996, he came to Mumbai for the first time
 jahaan se unke jivan kaa asli sangharsh shuru hua
 He got the first wage work
 mumbai jaise bade shahar main unhen sirf 4 hajaar rupee milte the, jisase badi mushkil se unka kharchaa chal paata tha
 Vimal knew that living in an expensive city like Mumbai is not going to work with wages
 mazdooree chhodkar vimal ne mumbai ke chita market main heere kii kai factriyon main polish kaa kaam dhundhana shuru kiya kyonki ve is kaam ko achche se jaanate the
 Vimal soon realized that he could never change his fortune by doing tax
 isliye unhone apni tankhwh se kuch paise bachaane bhi shuru kar die
 When some friends of Vimal, who started his own company, marketed diamonds at that time
 isse unhen acha-khaasaa kamishan hasil hota tha
 Vimal also slowly learned this trick and started doing the same thing from 1997 onwards
 ek saal heere kii polish karne ke baad vimal ne bhi brokar ke taur par kaam kiya or kuch din ke baad unhen har roj 1 se 2 hajaar rupee milane lage
 Then what was the money saved by those brokers, he opened his own company
 jiskaa naam rakhaa 'vimal james'
 Initially, only 8 people worked in his company
 lekin saal 2000 ke aate-aate unka kul turnover 15 lakh ho gaya
 Teachers will not be able to go to class with mobiles, know why? When they had to suffer losses, they also suffered losses in this career filled with struggle
 lekin unhone haar nahin maani
 The biggest shock to his company came when an employee ran away with a diamond worth Rs 29 lakh in 2001
 iske baad bhi vimal ke hausale dagamagaae nahi
 In 2009, he opened his own gem and jewelery outlet in Jalgaon
 vimal kaa idia tha ki vah estrologer ko hair karenge or graahak us estrologer kii salaah ke mutabik ratnon kii khariddaari karenge
 On seeing this, people started liking this brilliant idea of vimal
 phir kya iske baad vimal ne peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Now if you see a weak child in studies, then think about Vimal who failed in the 7th but today he owns 52 outlets in Maharashtra
 jinaki company main lagbhag 550 log kaam karte hai
 And today this company is included in the 100 crore club

 unhen is baat jaankaree nahin thi ki is phone ko ringing bels ise 251 rupee main bechegi
 He also said that he is very disappointed with this step of Ringing Bells and if needed, will also take legal action against the company
 kyonki isse hamaari company kaa naam kharaab ho saktaa he
 Significantly, Adcom is the same company that claims that Rigging Bells has bought devices from it which it sells on Flipkart for Rs 3,699
 bataa den ki ringing bels ne jab patrakaron ko phonerivyuu karne ke liye diyato usamen Adcom kaa logo laga hua tha

 Therefore, in the interest of the party and the movement, now the BSP will contest all the small and big elections going ahead on its own
 'iske saath hi mayawati ne do anya twit or kiye he
 In the first tweet, Mayawati said, 'all India meeting of BSP lasted for two and a half hours in Lucknow yesterday
 iske baad rajyavar baithkon kaa daur der raat tak chalata rahaa jisamen bhi media nahin tha
 Nevertheless, the things that have flashed in the media about the BSP chief are not completely correct even when the pressnote was also released about this

 basapa kii rashtriya str kii meeting main mayawati ne ravivaar ko kaha tha ki gathbandhan ke chunaav haarane ke baad akhilesh ne mujhe phone nahin kiya
 Satish Mishra asked him to call me, but still he did not call
 maine bade hone kaa ferj nibhaayaa or countig ke din 23 taarikh ko unhen phone kar unke parivaar ke haarane par afsos jataayaa
 Mayawati said that on June 3, when i talked about breaking the alliance at the Delhi meeting, Akhilesh called Satish Chandra Mishra, but still did not talk to me
 mayawati ne kaha ki akhilesh ne mishra se mujhe massej bhijwaya ki main musalamaanon ko tikat na duun, kyonki usase or dhruvikaran hoga, lekin maine unki baat nahin maani
 Mayawati alleged that Mulayam Singh Yadav had an important role with the BJP in framing me in the Taj Corridor case
 unhone kaha ki akhilesh kii sarkaar main gaiyr yadav or pichhadon ke saath ninsaphi hui, isliye unhone vot nahin kiya
 Apart from this, the SP opposed the reservation in the promotion, so the Dalits and the backward did not vote for it
 gauratlab he ki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle jab sapa or bispi ke gathbandhan kaa elaan ho rahaa tha to us din mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke haavbhaav ko dekhakar aisa lag rahaa tha ki ab yah donon partiyaan milakar lambey samay tak raajnneeti karengi
 Arithmetic was also in his favor and enthusiasm was at the peak of victory in the gorakhpur-phulpur-kairana by-election
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan donon hi netaa jamini hakeekat ko bhaanp nahin paae or karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa pad gaya
 The alliance has also been shattered with this defeat
 sapa ko jahaan 5 siten mili hai vahiin bispi ko 10 siten
 In a way, the BSP has gained more as the BSP did not get a single seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 duusari ore saare samikarnon ko dhwast karte hue bijepi 62 siten kaamyaab ho gai
 With this defeat, BSP supremo Mayawati took on SP President Akhilesh Yadav and said that the SP could not even support its core vote Yadavs and that is why his wife lost the election

 loksabhaa main paas hua espiji sanshodhan bilgrih mantri shah ne congress par kiye tikhe hamaleshah bole- gandhi parivaar kii suraksha badali gaidopaher kareeb 2 baje grih mantri amit shah ne espiji bill loksabhaa main pesh kiya
 After which there was a detailed discussion on the bill
 sadan ke tamaam sadasyon ne bill par apane vichaar vyakt kiye
 At the end of the discussion, the Home Minister offered his reply
 jiske baad bill ko paarit karne kaa prastaav pesh kiya jo ki dhvanimat se paarit ho gaya
 Let us also tell you that the members of the Congress, angry with the reply of the Home Minister, had gone out boycotting the proceedings of the House
 amit shah bole- nayaa sanshodhan act kii mul bhaavana ke anukulbil pesh karte vakt grih mantri amit shah ne kaha ki espiji kaa kanoon 88 main bana
 91 and 94 were amended
 99 or 2003 main sanshodhan hua
 Today again i have brought an amendment which is compatible with the original spirit
 is act ke tahat espiji protection sirf piem or unke parivaar ke saath jo unke saath adhikrut piem awaas main rahete hai unako hi praapt hoga
 In addition, those who are former Prime Ministers will get 5 years on the allotted accommodation
 unhone aage kaha isaki namavali main hi isaki mul bhaavana nihit he
 The public is mistaken that the SPG only acts as security
 jabaki espiji piem kii offis kii unke communication kii sabaki suraksha karti he
 The committee which was formed after the assassination of Indira ji said that a specific party should protect the Prime Minister, that means that the Prime Minister should be protected
 pradhanmantri sarkaar ke mukhiya hote hai isliye protection shabd kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Talking on the bill, the Home Minister further said that there are special groups in many countries in the world for the protection of their Head of State
 wo keval rashtradhyaksh or unke kaam kii chintaa karte hai
 The purpose behind this amendment is that SPG and officials should be made and there is no problem in the work of SPG, so we have brought it
 meraa anurodh he ki sab apane vichaar rakhen or bill ko sweekaar karen
 In the discussion that started after the question raised by Manish Tiwari, Congress MP Manish Tiwari said that today we have gathered to talk on a very sensitive bill which is related to the security of PM
 meraa kahana he ki itihaas is baat kaa gavaah he ki jab-jab aise nakaaratmak kadam uthaae gaye hai bahut bada khamiyaja is desh ko bhugatna padaa he
 Why does the government provide protection to a person
 police vyavastha kii gai awam kii suraksha ke liye
 Then the government indicates that there are some people who need protection from the government
 threat asestment ke hisaab se vibhinn shreniyon main suraksha pradaan kii jaati he
 This is a Threat Assessment, is it perfect science? unhone aage kaha ki suraksha bahut hi samvedansheel maamla he lekin durbhagyavash yah ek raajnneetik purvavlokan ban chukaa he
 Along with this, he also narrated a sentence related to himself
 unhone kaha ki 1984 main jab aatankwaadiyon ne mere pita kii hatya kii to hamen suraksha pradaan kii gai
 The house looked exactly like a camp
 1990 main sarkaar badali or raat main hi sari suraksha gaayab
 The government changed back in 1991 and security was back
 apane bayaan main manish tiwari ne rajeev gandhi hatyakand or uske baad banaai gai verma kamishan kii siforeeshon kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Manish Tiwari further said that the Atal government had provided that security should be provided as long as there is a Threat Assessment
 ye jo sanshodhan laayaa gaya he ki usamen purv pradhanmantriyon yaa unke pariwaron ko jo suraksha di jaani thi use hataa diya gaya
 This was the reason why SPG Protection of Rajiv Gandhi was removed
 gandhi parivaar se suraksha waapas lene kaa mudda uthaate hue manish tiwari ne kaha ki june se november tak unako lagaataar bolaa ja rahaa tha ki aapaki threat assesment bad rahi he
 Your life is in danger lekin achaanak aisa kya badla kii november 2019 main act ko sanshodhit kiye bagaiyr suraksha waapas le lee gai
 It is necessary to explain why the security was withdrawn
 durbhagyapurna baat he ki itihaas ek baar phir doharaa rahaa he
 i want to demand from the government that all those who are former Prime Ministers of India or have a family should be provided SPG protection as long as they are alive
 america main bhi purv raashtrapati ko sicret sarvice kii suvidha di jaati he yahi suvidha great britain main he or kai deshon main he
 i request that the issue of security should be seen rising above party politics
 apane jawaab main grih mantri ne congress par bole hamalegrih mantri amit shah ne charchaa ke baad apana jawaab pesh kiya
 He said that many members took part on this important bill
 jahaan tak congress or unke saathiyon ke bhaashan ko maine dhyaan se suna usase aisa lag rahaa he ki yah gandhi parivaar kii suraksha hataane ke liye laayaa ja rahaa he
 What concerns him was the change of thought under the old act itself
 yah act to ab laayaa ja rahaa he
 It seems that the government is not concerned about the safety of the Gandhi family
 apni baat aage badhaate hue amit shah ne kaha ki unki suraksha hataai nahin gai he vyavastha badali gai he
 i want to say that they have been given z plus with ASL
 ASL means going to the place to go and will do the assessment
 vahaan ambulance hogi, doctor honge, siarpief ke jawan honge
 i want to ask how the SPG is formed, there are only CRPF personnel in it
 group main vibhinn suraksha balon ke jawan hote hai
 He protects not only security but also office and communication
 congress par hamalaa bolte hue grih mantri ne kaha ki main record par kahata hum ki abhi tak jitne badal hue ek parivaar ke liye hue yah pehla badlaav he jo piem kii suraksha ke liye laayaa ja rahaa he
 No one said the security of Chandrashekhar ji, no one said the safety of IK Gujral, Dr
 manmohan singh kii suraksha badali gai koi nahin bolaa chintaa vyakt nahin kii
 These are the two criteria that the whole country should understand
 yah sirf ek parivaar kii chintaa he
 SPG has been made a status symbol
 isi se kisi kii suraksha jane vaali he to vah narendra modi ji kii jane vaali he jab ve piem nahin rahenge 6wein saal suraksha chali jaaegi
 The Home Minister further said that this is only a demand for the safety of one family
 aapako aashwast karnaa chahta hum ki unki suraksha kii paryaapt vyavastha kar di gai he
 When it came to the Verma Committee, we gave security in advance and then removed the SPG
 sabko suraksha kii vyavastha di gai he
 But Prime Minister cannot protect everyone
 threat assesment do baar kiya gaya, uske baad nirnay liya gaya
 There was a Threat Assessment earlier, this does not mean that there will still be a Threat Assessment
 apane jawaab main unhone aage kaha ki sabhi mukhyamantriyon ko siarpief kaa jed plus nahin he
 It is given on the basis of the Threat Assessment
 political vendata ke hisaab se aisa nahin kiya gaya he
 The SPG is made up of the prorate of each force
 yah viviipi culture kii baat he
 The need for the protection of BJP workers inside Bengal is therefore given
 vahaan sipiai or congress ke netaaon ko bhi di he
 i want to assure that the Modi government can never take security decisions on the basis of vendetta
 vah porli profeshnal tareeke se lee gai he
 Full security has also been provided for them
 lagbhag 600 baar koi soochna die apane kaarykram main chale gaye
 Not even once in 20 years, PM Modi did not have security fouls
 Some people roam with expensive bikes in the speed of 100-100 km
 suraksha kii gaadiyaan peeche-peeche daudti hai
 How far will i tell you? main udhaaharan dena chahta hum ki 20 saal se unke paas suraksha cover he lekin ek baar bhi suraksha foul nahin aayaa
 He has set strict standards in his life
 duusari ore espiji suraksha ko states simbel banaate hai to main kahuunga ki sabko hamaare pradhanmantri se siikhnaa chahie
 On the river front, PM Modi had decided to move beyond security to increase tourism there
 unka vahaan koi tej raftaar main thandi hawa khaane kaa shauk nahin tha
 All three members have been given z Plus with ASFL, but if it is to say that the security of the Prime Minister is needed, then it is only for the Prime Minister
 rashtriya rajdhani dilli ke logon ko pradooshan se bachaane ke liye dilliiitiki ek team ne antipolutionwindo taiyaar kiya he, jo gharon main lagane vaali aam khidakiyon se alag he
 This will not only allow mosquitoes to enter the house, but will also help to protect the house from air pollution
 ise dilli iaiti kii team ne nezo filter polution net khidki naam diya he
 The special thing is that most of the rain water does not enter inside the house, whereas all the water from the common window enters the house
 polimar, nanofiber se bani ye windo nanotechnonogytarike se taiyaar kii gai he
 Its fine holes increase surface tension and prevent water from entering
 ye PM 10 vaale bade pradooshan kanon ko dur karne ke saath hi PM 2
 Prevents 5 out of 90 percent
 research team ke pratik sharma ne bataaya ki iske na sirf khidki balki daravaaje or parade bhi lagaae ja sakate hai
 Once the special window made of nezo filter pollution net is installed, it will get rid of pollution for 5 years
 aam khidki main ‘polution net vid wel kro’ lagavakar use pradooshan mukt khidki main tabdeel kiya ja saktaa he
 It will cost Rs 160 per square foot, where the room purifier consumes more electricity, while there is no cost in this particular window
 ek research ke mutabik dilli ke gharon ke andar baahar kii apeksha 10 guna zyadapolutionhota he
 What is Nezo Filter Pollution Net? Pratish Sharma said that these filters stick to the nose holes and prevent foreign particles from entering the body
 yah ek biodegradable utpaada he
 Sharma said that its cost is low, due to which the public can use it
 unhone kaha ki filter PM 10 kanon ko 100 pratishat or PM 2
 Will keep 5 particles away by 95 percent
 filter 8-10 ghante tak chal sakate hai
 Nejo filters can be used like the Pollution Net Komaskki, designed and developed using nanotechnology
 PM 2
 5 is the size of the particle material able to penetrate the farthest in your body
 yah fefdon main pravesh karata he or phir aapke rakt pravaah main ja saktaa he
 PM 10 is usually stuck in the nose hair
 nejo filter PM 2
 Is largely capable of stopping both 5 and PM 10
 sachin tendulkar or rekha bataur rajya sabha ke manonith sadsy apana kaarykaal puraa kar rahe hai
 Farewell ceremony was held for 85 mps retiring from Rajya Sabha in Parliament
 haalanki is dauraan donon rekha or sachin ko sansad kii bench par nahin dekha gaya
 Therefore, it is possible that like his tenure of the last 6 years, even on this occasion, both the nominated members have any compulsion to engage in cricket or film
 aisa isliye ki apane 6 saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan donon ne sansad ke hue sabhi satron main mahaj ek yaa do din sadan main maujuud rahe
 This presence also remained so that his Rajya Sabha membership remained constant
 lekin jahaan tak sansad main kisi saansad kii jimmedaari kaa sawaal uthta he to donon ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan sawaal poochna, jawaab dena or kanoon banane ke kaam ko koi tarjeeh nahin di
 Did the two, who were nominated to Parliament 6 years ago, fulfill the objective? 6 years of Rekha as a member in Rajya Sabha Rekha did not ask a single question during the 6-year tenure, if you look at the figures on the Rajya Sabha website
 jaahir he jab sawaal nahin poocha to kendra sarkaar dwaara unase koi samvaad nahin kiya gaya
 When an MP asks a question in the House, it is answered by the Central Government and that question is recorded in the Register of Parliament and also updated on the Rajya Sabha website
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki sansad kii taraf se rekha ko sadan ke kaamkaaj main shaamil karne kii koi pahal nahin kii gai
 Rekha was inducted as a member of the Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution from September 2016
 is samiti main rekha ke kisi tarah ke yogadan kaa byora sansad ke paas nahin he, jaahir he yahaan bhi unhone kuch bhi kehane-sunne kii jarurat nahin samajhi
 Read this: Data Leak: Claims of unseen-unknown person have been fought; Rekha has always been in the headlines in the bjp-congress film world
 lekin rajyasabha ke unke kaarykaal ke dauraan kabhi sansad main unke naam kaa zikr bhi nahin kiya gaya
 Why is it even mentioned when he never tried to do anything in the role of MP
 sansad main sawaal poochne ke alaava saansad dwaara koi bill laana uski jimmedaari kaa ahm hissaa he
 But Rekha did not introduce a single bill in Parliament during her entire tenure
 ab ant main rekha kii sadan main maujuudagi kaa aankada bataa rahaa he ki sabhi manonith sadasyon main unki atendence sabase kharaab rahi he
 During her tenure, she was included in 18 sittings in total 373 sittings of Parliament held till August 2017
 yani puure kaarykaal ke dauraan unki kul atendence mahaj 5 fisadi rahi
 Rekha gave an application to not attend the session of the House only once and explained the reason for not being able to work in the film
 haalanki kuch satron se vah bina aplicoshan die gaayab raheen
 However, Rekha took such care during her tenure that her membership remained for the entire term
 sansad ke niyam ke mutabik yadi koi saansad sansad ke kaamkaaj se lagaataar 60 dinon tak bina soochna gaayab rahata he ko uski sadsyta khatm kiye jane kaa praavdhaan he
 But Rekha's attendance never went against this rule of 60 days and she continued to get the facilities of the MP for the entire term
 rajyasabha main bataur sadsy sachin ke 6 saljahan tak sansad main sawaal poochne kaa adhikaar he to sachin tendulkar kaa record rekha se bahut behatar he
 In response to Rekha's zero questions, there are 22 questions in Sachin's record, whose details have been included on the Rajya Sabha website
 unke sawaal railway network ke electriffication, new ajukeshan policy main sports ko bataur vishay shaamil karnaa or railway suraksha jaise vishyon par kendrit rahe
 In response to these questions of Sachin, the Central Government has also answered the questions of making Yoga and sports as school subjects and sports compulsory subject
 sachin ke jin sawaalon ke jawaab sarkaar dwaara die gaye unhen sachin ne disambar 2015 main puche the
 He was also made a member of the Committee on Information Technology on behalf of Parliament in 2016, although the details of his contribution to this committee have not been released by the Parliament
 vahiin unke kaarykaal ke dauraan rajyasabha main unke naam par bhi kabhi koi charchaa nahin kii gai
 Read this: Akhilesh was running fast from the center, the big challenge posed for Yogi, as far as the Attendance Register of Parliament is concerned, Sachin's attendance line was not as bad but his attendance can not be called good
 sachin ke kaarykaal main agast 2017 tak sansad ke kul 373 sittings main vah 25 sittings main shaamil rahe hai
 That is, Sachin's attendance was 7 percent
 rekha kii tarj par sachin ne bhi apane kaarykaal ke dauraan itani saavdhaanee barti ki unki sadsyta par kabhi khatra nahin paidaa hua
 During his 6-year tenure, Sachin attended one to two days in almost all sessions of Parliament and never disappeared for 60 consecutive days during the session of Parliament
 vahiin sachin 6 saal ke dauraan 3 baar sansad ko soochna dete hue gaayab rahe or iske liye sachin ne cricket match or kaarobaari vyastata kaa hawala diya

 congress ke bade netaa or purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh kii narmada parikrama samaapt hone ke do din pehle uma bharti ne dijvijay singh ko ek chitthee likhi he
 And this letter has given rise to new political equations
 ek samay uma ne digvijay ko 'mistar bantaadhaar' kahkar unase satta chhini thi
 Now if the closeness between Uma and Digvijay increases, it will not only prove to be a challenge for Shivraj, but will also pose problems for Jyotiraditya Scindia, who considers himself the CM face of the Congress
 yahaan congress kai khemon main banty he
 Shivraj Singh did not give importance to Uma Bharti in his Narmada Yatra, but Digvijay started laying a political check by sending a personal invitation to Uma Bharti at the conclusion of his Narmada Parikrama, examining the influence of Uma
 darasal, uma bharti pehle hi yah ghoshnaa kar chukin hai ki vah loksabhaa kaa chunaav nahin ladengeen
 She has always been active in the politics of Madhya Pradesh and it is believed that Uma Bharti wants to revive her influence in the Assembly elections this time and emerge as powerful once again
 pichley kuch dinon se uma bharti madhya pradesh main pichhadaa varg sammelnon khaskar lodh samaaj ke kaaryakramon main lagaataar shirkat kar samaaj ke logon ko ek hone kaa sandesh detii raheen hai
 In a letter written to Digvijay Singh on the occasion of concluding the Narmada Parikrama of Narmada Parikrama, Uma sought from Digvijay, Uma Bharti said, Respected brother sir, dear Digvijay Singh

 uma bharatishivaraj singh or uma ke bich he siyaasi takaravakabhi madhya pradesh main congress ke haath se satta chhinakar camel khilaane kaa puraa shrey uma bharti ko hi jaataa he
 She became the Chief Minister after Digvijay Singh
 baad main unhen istipha dena padaa
 After this she continued to be marginalized in Madhya Pradesh
 naaraaz hokar unhone apni alag party bana lee, lekin vah kaamyaab nahin huin
 Shivraj Singh, with full force, got Uma Bharati defeated from Bada Malhara to the elections
 isi ke baad se uma or shivaraj main anban shuru ho gai
 Recently, on the ken-betwa project, Shivraj also hit Uma by putting a hindrance
 vahiin narmada yatra main bhi uma bharti ko shivaraj ne koi ahmiyat nahin di thi
 Shivraj will have difficulty with Uma because in the last few days, the growing rivalry between Uma and Shivraj is not going to create less problem for BJP in Madhya Pradesh
 uma bharti mantrimandal main kiye gaye pherbadal ke baad kendriya netritv se lekar madhya pradesh tak main apni naaraazgi ke saath prabhaav kaa ishaara kar chukin hai
 The leadership too could not ignore his influence
 uma lodh samaaj kii sarvamaanya netaa maani jaatin hai
 This society has influence on about 70 seats in the state
 yani bina lodh samaaj ke saport ke bhaajapa ke liye jeet kathin he
 In view of this, Uma Bharti is nothing short of a political obstacle for Shivraj Singh
 shivaraj ne bhi isaki kaat ke liye prahlada patel jaise netaaon ko apane paksh main kiya he, lekin uma kaa prabhaav kaaphi vyapak he
 Dijvijay's biggest challenge in front of Scindia is Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh is being considered as the main contender of CM face in the upcoming assembly elections
 kamalnath jaise bade netaa bhi sindhiya ke samarthan main dekhe ja rahe hai, lekin yahaan congress ke pradesh adhyaksh arun yadav or netaa pratipaksh ajay singh sindhiya ke samarthan main nahin hai
 Along with this, Dijvijay Singh also does not want the election to be led by Scindia
 netaaon kaa yahi aapasi takaraav congress ke liye chunauti he
 Congress spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi says, "there is no confrontation in Congress
" sindhiya or dijvijay singh ke bich raajnneetik takaraav nahin he
 He has always blessed Scindia
 "hardik ne shuru kii sindhiya kii pairocarividhansabha chunaav ke thik pehle hardik patel kii madhya pradesh main sakriyata ke bhi siyaasi myne hai
 Hardik is here to unite the backward with the Patidar society against the BJP
 iske saath hardik ne yah bhi elaan kar diya ki yadi jyotiraditya sindhiya ko siem cheharaa banaaya gaya to vah congress ko jitaane ke liye puri takat laga denge
 Hardik's statement shows that he is a pro-scindia supporter and this is not the case for the leaders who pulled the line against Scindia in the Congress
 shaayad dijvijay singh bhi nahin chahenge ki koi gujarat se aakar unke pradesh main siem ke naam kaa samarthan apane andaaj main kare
 *** pre-mechor baby agar maa kaa doodh pien to unka dil majboot hota he

 com / iwmtqsxv4m— Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi)april 13, 2018isse pehle, rahul gandhi ne twit kiya or kaha ki in ghatnaon par lakhon bharatiyon kii tarah meraa dil bhi dukhi he
 We cannot leave women in this condition
 aaie shanti or insaaf ke liye india get par candal march main hissaa len
 On this appeal of Rahul, the youth gathered at India Gate at midnight
 ye congress kii badali hui siyasat or rahul ke yuva andaaj kaa ek or najaara tha
 In recent years, Rahul has become increasingly successful in connecting the youth with his politics out of the box
 aisa nahin he ki rahul gandhi ne aisa pehali baar kiya he
 Know here about five such occasions when Rahul was able to raise the issues of youth-dalits and farmers and make connections with them against the Modi government
 jahaan piem modi yaa bijepi ke paas pehle ection kaa mauka tha lekin kuch hua nahin or logon kii aashaaon ko samajhate hue rahul ne unki aawaaj buland kii
 1
 unnav-kathua cese par desh kaa gussa or modi-bijepi kii chuppiupi ke unnav main rape ke aaropee bijepi vidhayak par ection main deree or peedita ke pita kii police castady main maut ke baad karrwai karne main deree se jahaan bijepi nishane par thi or jammu ke kathua main 8 saal kii maasoom bacchee ke rape-murder ke vibhats maamle par desh gusse main tha to aadhi raat ko rahul gandhi ne candal march kar desh ke gusse ko apni aawaaj di or centre kii modi sarkaar or upi kii yogi sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa kiya
 Finally, on Friday morning, the CBI arrested Kuldeep Sengar but before that the anger of the people against Modi and Yogi government reached its peak
 sarkaar kii is chuppi ne rahul gandhi ko credit lene kaa mauka de diya
 2
 essi / asti act, rohit vemula or jeenyu maamlaissi / asti act main badlaav ke khilaaf jab 2 april ko dalit yuvaaon ne bharat band kaa aahvaan kiya to rahul gandhi ne unki maangon kaa samarthan kiya or kaha ki dalit yuva apane adhikaron ke liye lard rahe hai unhen salaam
 After strong opposition to the matter, the Modi government finally had to file a reconsideration petition in the Supreme Court and had to repeatedly clarify before the Dalit community that neither changes were made in this matter nor the government reservation
 The government is trying to change the system
 yahaan sarkaar ne agar pehle hi kadam uthaae hote to rahul gandhi ko mudde ko apane paksh main bhunaane kaa mauka nahin miltaa
 Similarly, in Rohit Vemula and JNU case, Rahul Gandhi supported the youth out of the box and managed to surround the Modi government
 3
 Bhatta Parsaul and Farmers' Mudamai In 2011, the BSP government was in UP and farmers were protesting against land acquisition for the expressway project in Bhatta Parsaul village in Greater Noida
 rahul gandhi ne aitihaasik kadam uthaaya
 Despite the administration's ban, Rahul Gandhi dodged them and reached Bhatta Parsaul by bike and supported the struggle of the farmers
 isi tarah pichley saal jab maharashtra or madhya pradesh main kisaan modi sarkaar ke khilaaf apni maangon ko lekar dharne par the tab bhi rahul gandhi vahiin pahunche the or kisaanon ke muddon par aawaaj buland kii thi

 team modi faisle le isse pehle soft hindutv kaa safal prayog2014 main hindutv card ke saath prachand bahumat se chunaav jeetne vaali bijepi sarkaar par ram mandir, tripal talaak samet kai muddon par jahaan kadam uthaane kaa dabaav he vahiin rahul gandhi ne congress kii paramparaagat niti ko peeche chhodte hue soft hindutv kii niti ko apanaaya
 Implementing this formula in the Gujarat elections, Rahul Gandhi continued to visit temples
 nateeja sabake saamne he
 In the Gujarat elections, he was successful in taking the Congress closer to the majority
 haalanki, sarkaar bijepi kii bani lekin 2019 se pehle siyaasi dangal main is daanv se rahul gandhi ne congress ko syrius pratibhaagi ke rup main sthapit kar diya
 In the same way, Rahul Gandhi has been successful in weakening the edge of bjp's Hindutva politics by visiting Lingayat stakes and all the monasteries in Karnataka

 When Advani's condition reached Parliament to ask, Rahul's rivalry is in place but Rahul Gandhi took a different step during the Parliament session last month
 achaanak rahul gandhi bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani kaa haal-chaal poochne pahunch gaye
 At the same time, seeing PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah in the corridor of Parliament, he went ahead without paying any attention
 baad main karnataka kii raily main rahul gandhi ne kaha ki piem modi jab bhi milte hai sirf hai helo karte hai kisi siruyas mudde par baat nahin karte
 Whereas the earlier prime minister used to talk to the leaders of the opposition on big issues
 rahul gandhi ne yahaan ye sanket dene kii koshish kii ki piem modi kaa kaam kaa tarika van main sho jaisaa he jabaki ve sabhi dalon ko saath lekar chalane kii niti par chalate hai
 One of the stars of the film John Director Ahisore Solomonactor Naseeruddin Shah, Randeep Hooda, Sharnaz Patel, Sharat Saxena, Elena Kazan, Vipin Sharma, Makrand Deshpandep
 ek produsar sahab hai
 He bets on the story of a boy named Neeraj Pandey
 film bani e vednesade
 Great low budget acting
 yaadgaar kirdaar vaali film, jo ab bhi jab tivi par aati he, to betarah dekhi jaati he
 The producer felt that he had found a working formula
 unhone duusare diarector ko pakadaa, ek spanish laa kaja 507 kii kahani kaa bollywoodkaran kiya or puraane sabak ke taur par nasiruddin shah ko le liya
 The film became John Day
 jo behad tangadil, kanfujd, adhure kisse sunaati or boring si thriller he
 The film also seems inspired by a Wednesday
 vahaan naseer aam aadmi the, unka makasad or taiyaariyaan badi thim
 Naseer is in John Day's role here
 unka makasad puri tarah se personal he or aakhir main vah bollywood ke ek ausat hero kii tarah sabko maar giraate hai
 In this surprise firing we also die
 jon de kahani he isi naam ke ek bank manager kii
 His daughter died in an accident
 jon or uski bivi is haadase se ubarne kii betarah koshish kar rahe hai
 Then another incident happens with them
 ab boodha jon faisla karata he ki use hi kuch karnaa hoga
 There is an ACP
 jisaki alcoholic garlfriend he or he ek land deal
 Two donas stand on two sides of this deal
 dubai main baitha pathan or mumbai se hukum chalaata khan
 The acp's game of making the most money between them goes on until John comes in his way, who has a passionate motive and divine luck to help him
 ant main sab apni filmi nyyochit gati ko praapt hote hai
 Naseeruddin Shah has acted well in the film
 magar kahani itani bhurabhuri he, ki sab bekaar ho jaataa he
 For the time being, his wife Sharnaaz Patel seems relieved and gives some hope
 randeep hooda asipi ke role main aise dikhte hai, jaise unhen kabj kii shikaayat ho, hangover ho or chuingam unke ek jabade main chipak gai ho
 As a result, you are stuck with type eyes, chewed dialogue and flat face
 unki garlfriend ke role main elena aisi dikhti hai, jaise unhen hindi bolne main bahut takalif hoti ho
 Kangana's twin sister, who is a gangster and fashionistress, is seen on screen, speaking as if she is stuck
 film main kai achche actor hai
 But he did not have much role
 masalan
 Makarand Deshpande or Anant Mahadevan
 vipin sharma ko kuch spes mili he or utane main hi vah apane zanjeer ke amitabh factor se gudguda jate hai
 Sarat Saxena's acting is good
 magar sabaki tarah unka role bhi bahut kuch kehane ke pher main adhar main latak jaataa he
 The film seems to try to say something philosophical with the help of religious symbols
 har insaan main ek bhediya hota he
 Everyone is surrounded in the darkness of their past
 aisa hi kuch or bhi
 John's religion is Christian, he gets beaten at one place, falls on the cross, and then a miracle twist comes
 asipi bachapan ke haadase se ab tak govern hota he
 Khan continues to punish himself for his crimes, yet does not leave mafiyagiri
 film main gaaliyon kaa gey dhang se istemaal he
 They say in the street, they are abusing by singing too much
 usee tip se
 Apart from this, there are some such scenes of blood mule, which were seen as emetic
 tarantino kii dividi zyada dekhne ke yahi nuksaan hai
 The film is being told a thriller
 magar uski pehali shart raftaar or pehali jarurat baandhe rakhane vaali rahasy romaanch se bhari kahani, donon yahaan nadaarad hai
 One can only rest assured that songs do not come in between
 asipi kisi dance baar main nahin jaataa
 The villain does not have a face
 thakee hui kahani ke bich main kuch ek samvaad dhang ke hai
 But if the mite is being killed, then who will be able to save the wheat
 jon de dekhne kii sifarish main katai nahin karuunga
 The rest is your wish to decide the fate of your day

 notebandi ke bhale hi aapako pareshaan kiya ho lekin ab uskaa positive asar bhi saamne aane laga he
 This is reflected in the newly released data of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne bataaya he ki notebandi ke baad tex net yani tex dene waalon kii sankhya kaa dayera record tezi se badha he
 After demonetisation, it has been successful to include 91 lakh new people in the list of tax payers
 darasal aap ise kamyaabi isliye maan sakate hai kyonki ek news paper kii ek research ke mutabik ausatan har saal tex dene waalon main 60 lakh nae log judate the
 Whereas 10 lakh people were either retired or excluded from the list due to death
 kul milakar har saal nae tex dene vaale ausatan 50 lakh log hote the
 And if we look at the CBDT data for 2012-14, the number of 91 lakhs is affected
 CBDT ke mutabik 2013-14 main 46 lakh to 2014-15 main 30 lakh log tex ke daayre main aae

 Actually, you can consider it successful because according to a research in a news paper, on an average, 60 lakh new people were added to the tax payers every year
 jabaki 10 lakh log yaa to ritair hokar yaa phir maut kii vajah se is suchi se baahar ho jate the
 In total there were an average of 5 million people paying new taxes every year
 or agar sibiditi ke 2012-14 kaa aankada dekhen to 91 lakh kii sankhya prabhavit karti he
 According to the CBDT, in 2013-14, 46 lakhs and in 2014-15, 30 lakh people came under the tax net
 tippaniyan Sometimes the figure has increased, it has decreased in some years
 lekin is tarah kii record badhat haal ke saalon main kabhi nahin hua
 The government has been consistently saying that the economy has benefited from demonetisation, if the CBDT figures are considered, then at least on the tax front, the government seems to be a success
 kabhi aankada badha he to kisi saal kam bhi hua he
 But such record gains have never happened in recent years

 The 333-run defeat by Virat Kohli-led Team India in the Pune Test was shocking
 aakhir kyon na ho, bharat daure par ai australia team ke khilaaf team india ko jeet kaa prabal daavedaar mana ja rahaa tha
 With this defeat of Pune, Team India's record of being unbeatable in 19 consecutive matches has also been broken
 behad majboot maani jane vaali bhartiya ballebaaji kii naakaami ke kaaran pune main team india ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Interestingly, Indian batsmen surrendered anonymously against spin bowler Steve o'keefe rather than Australian fast bowlers like Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood
 vaise pune kii haar ke baad bhi desh ke diggaj cricket khilaadi viraat kohli ke paksh main majbootee se khadey hue hai
 The comments pehla test haarane ke baad bhartiya team ke liye bengaluru main hone vaale duusare test main acha pradarshan karnaa behad jaruri ho gaya he
 If the Indian team has to regain the border-gavaskar Trophy, then they will have to avoid defeat in the second test
 gharelu maidan main 2014-15 main australia ne bharat ko 2-0 se haraaya tha or yah trophy philhal australia ke hi paas he
 In terms of batting, the performance of Team India will be very much on the captain Virat Kohli
 kohli pune test kii donon pariyon main bhale hi chal nahin paae hon, lekin is naakaami ne unhen nishchit rup se aage ke maichon main behatar karne ke liye prerit kiya hoga
 After Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly has also supported Virat and his team for the second test starting on 4 March
 ganguli ne 'india today' se baatcheet main kaha, 'aakhirkaar kohli bhi insaan hai or ek na ek din unhen naakaam hona hi tha
 In Pune, he flopped in both innings
 mujhe lagata he ki unhone pehali pari main of stump ke baahar kii gend par looj shot khelaa

 It was said about Sachin that he gave his best performance against Australia
 ganguli ne kaha, 'australia ke khilaaf australia main hi ek ke baad ek chaar test shatak dekhnaa
 
 maine sachin ko bhi aisa karte hue nahin dekha
 In the second test, Team India can make some changes in their playing XI
 siraj kaa teesraa test ranchi or chauthaa dharmashala main khelaa jayega
 After losing the first test, it has become very important for the Indian team to perform well in the second test to be held in Bengaluru
 bhartiya team ko agar border-gavaskar trophy phir se hasil kerani he to duusare test main haar se bachanaa hoga
 Australia beat India 2–0 in 2014–15 at home ground and the trophy is currently with Australia
 ballebaaji ke lihaaj se team india ke pradarshan kaa daaromadar bahut kuch captain viraat kohli par hoga
 Kohli may not have been able to walk in both innings of the Pune Test, but this failure will definitely motivate him to do better in the matches ahead
 master blaster sachin tendulkar ke baad saurav ganguli ne bhi 4 march se prarambh ho rahe duusare test ke liye viraat or unki team kaa samarthan kiya he
 Ganguly said in a conversation with India Today, 'after all, Kohli is also a human being and one day he had to fail
 pune main ve donon pariyon main flop rahaa
 i think he played a loose shot on the ball outside the off stump in the first innings
 ' During this, Ganguly also compared Virat's performance with Tendulkar
 sachin ke bare main yah kaha jaataa tha ki ve apana sarvshereshth pradarshan australia ke khilaaf dete the
 Ganguly said, "watching four Test centuries against Australia in Australia
 
 i did not see Sachin doing this either
 ' duusare test main team india apni ekadash main kuch badlaav kar sakati he
 The third Test of Siraj will be played in Ranchi and the fourth in Dharamshala
 is dauraan ganguli ne tendulkar ke saath viraat ke pradarshan kii tulana bhi kii
 It was said about Sachin that he gave his best performance against Australia
 ganguli ne kaha, 'australia ke khilaaf australia main hi ek ke baad ek chaar test shatak dekhnaa
