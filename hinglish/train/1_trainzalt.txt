 com / 1o0wpxcyi3 Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh region, the Congress had said that the BJP had lost its ground in the state and the visit was an attempt by the BJP to regain it before the Lok Sabha elections
 pradesh congress samiti ke adhyaksh ji e mir ne kaha ki bhaajapa jammu-kashmir ke logon se kiye gaye vaade ko puraa karne main ‘bure tareeke se vifal' rahi he or uske paas logon ko dikhaane ke liye kuch bhi nahin he
 Mir said, 'the Prime Minister's visit is the bjp's way of showing how committed and concerned it is for the development of the people
 'bataa den, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ravivaar ko jammu main ek akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) or ek bhartiya jansanchaar santhaan (iiemasi) samet vibhinn vikaas pariyojnaon kii aadharshila rakhi
 Modi said that with the establishment of new AIIMS, there will be a change in health facilities in the area and the youth will also get new opportunities
 jammu ke logon ne kshetra main ames kii sthapana ke liye kareeb do maheene tak pradarshan kiya tha
 National Conference (NC) and Congress also demonstrated here in support of this demand
 prastaavit ames 700 bistaron kaa hoga
 The Prime Minister said that the state has been given Rs 750 crore for the establishment of five new medical colleges
 modi ne kaha ki in medical collejon main satr jald shuru hoga
 MBBS had only 500 seats for the last 70 years, but the BJP government has now doubled the seats
 unhone jammu main iiemasi ke uttar kshetreey centre ke parisar kaa shilanyas kiya
 It will be constructed at a cost of Rs 16 crore
 bhojpuri film star arvind akelaa kallu apni hi film 'aawaara balam' kii abhinetri tanushri ke ek video ke diwane ho gaye hai
 In this video, Tanu Sri is eyeing the internet sensation like Priya Prakash
 kallu or tanushri kii film 'aawaara balam' 25 may ko relies hone vaali he
 Kallu says that both were present on one occasion in connection with the promotion of this film, that suddenly Tanushree surprised everyone with an eye
 koun hai bhojpuri actress manisha raay jinaki sadak haadase main ho gai maut?idhar, tanushri kaa aankh maarane vaala yah video ab soshal media main viral ho rahaa he, jisamen tanushri behad romantic lag rahi hai
 By the way, this video of Tanushree has gone viral even before the release of her release film Awara Balam
 aise main logon kaa kahana he ki in adaaon ke kaaran tanushri ke prashansakon kii sankhya badhegi or log unki film ko dekhne pahunchenge
 Meanwhile, Tanushree said that the idea of winking suddenly came to her mind
 yah koi sochi-samajhi yojana nahin thi
 However, he also said that people liked Kallu too much and he shouted once more
 bhojpuri actress monaalisa kaa video viral, dikhin bold andaaj menunhone kaha, "darshakon kaa yah utsaah dekh kar mujhe puraa yakeen he ki hamaari film 'aawaara balam' log jarur dekhenge or unhen pasand bhi aegi

 " jiesti parishad kii 25veen baithak main jiesti ritern file karne par charchaa hui
 During this, Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani also gave a presentation on bringing a single form to file GST return
 philhal bhale hi iske liecingle formanhin aa rahaa he, lekin isaki taiyaari kar lee gai he
 It may be decided to bring it in the next meeting of the council
 hui charchagruuvaar ko jiesti parishad kii baithak ke paas ek ahm mudda jiesti ritern file karnaa aasaan bananaa tha
 At present, many types of forms have to be filled by traders as GST returns
 isamen sabase ahm jiestiar3, jiestiar1, or jiestiar2 he
 Due to the large number of forms, small businessmen are facing difficulties in filing returns
 kaarobaariyon ko ho rahi dikkatkaarobaariyon kii shikaayat he ki unhen ritern file karne ke liye kai saare form bharne padate hai
 Apart from this, the present system of return filing is very confusing
 chote kaarobaari abhi tak is vyavastha ko dhang se samaj bhi nahin paae hai
 This is the reason that the number of traders filing GST returns is increasing at a very slow pace
 isliye saral karne kii jaruratjiasti ritern filingko saral or aasaan banane kii maang kaarobaari lagaataar kar rahe hai
 Simplifying the process of GST return filing will facilitate traders
 iske chalate zyada kaarobaari ritern bharne main kaamyaab rahenge
 Which will result in an increase in the filing under GST
 kya he nayaa plansti parishad ke adhyaksh or vitt mantri arun jetali ne bataaya ki jiesti ritern file karne ko aasaan banaaya ja rahaa he
 Initially, there will be a GSTR-3B and a supply invoice
 unhone bataaya ki baithak main is par charchaa to kii gai he, lekin philhal ise lagu nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Single format will be ready, he said that the group of ministers headed by Bihar Chief Minister Sushil Modi and Nandan Nilekani can prepare a better format of single form for returns
 jetali ne kaha ki yah taiyaar hone ke baad ise manjuuri di ja sakati he
 The council's plan is that under the new plan, GSTR 1, GSTR 2 and GSTR 3 will be scrapped and instead traders will have to fill GSTR-3B initially
 iske saath hi unhen supplai invaais aplod karnaa hoga
 It will be easier to file returns, an official said that this system will be further improved in the coming time
 unhone bataaya ki aane vaale samay main kaarobaariyon ko sirfasplai invaioplod karnaa pad saktaa he
 He hoped that the monthly filing of returns can be done at the annual level in future
 maujuuda samay main ye hai formgstiar-1: yah masik ritern kaa ek form he, jisamen kaarobaari ko sabhi tarah kii bikri kaa byora dena hota he
 GSTR-2: Another form of monthly return, in which the businessman has to give details of purchases made at his level
 jiestiar-3: yah form jiestiar-1 orjiastiar-2main di gai detail ke aadhaar par auto janaret kiya jaataa he
 It contains complete information about GST on sale and purchase
 gujarat vidhansabha ke nattejey lagbhag agsit pols ke mutabik hi rahe
 According to estimates, the BJP succeeded in forming the government
 haalanki congress bhi pehle kii apeksha zyada majbootee se ubharkar saamne ai he
 After 22 years, the Congress in Gujarat stayed slightly away from the 'dehri' of power
 vaapasi kii agali koshish ke liye ab use kam se kam paanch saal or intazaar karnaa padegaa
 In a way, Gujarat has become an impregnable fort of BJP in the country
 # 1
 Is Jyoti Basu of Gujarat Narendra Modi BJP alone formed government after defeating Congress in Gujarat assembly elections in 1995
 haalanki rajya main chimanbhai patel ke saath bijepi gathbandhan kii sarkaar kaaphi pehle hi satta main aa gai thi, par gathbandhan lanbaa nahin chalaa
 In 2001, Narendra Modi was sent as the Chief Minister
 uske baad se abhi tak ye paanchvaan chunaav he jo modi ke chehre par ladaa gaya or bijepi ko usamen kamyaabi mili
 If we look at Jyoti Basu in West Bengal, in 1977, the Left Front came to power under his leadership
 2000 main buddhadev bhattacharya kaa mukhyamantri banane tak vam morche ne jyoti basu ke chehre par hi chunaav ladaa or jeeta
 Even if we say that Jyoti's face was the left face in West Bengal till then, it would probably not be wrong
 2010 main unka nidhan hua or 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaav main mamata banerjee ne vam ko baahar uthaa phenkaa
 Jyoti's tenure in Bengal was the longest in 33 years in power and he was the face of the 'left impregnable fort'
 vaise hi gujarat ke 22 saal kii lagaataar satta main modi hai
 # 2
 jyoti-modi ne apane rajyon ko kaise banaaya kaise abhedya durgajab 70 ke dashak main jyoti basu west bengal kii satta main kabiz hue unhone kuch aise kaam kiye jinaki vajah se bengal vam kaa garh bana
 Jyoti Basu gave prominence to popular decisions related to public interest
 rajya main bhoomi sudhaar lagu kiya
 Welfare work for farmers
 bade paimaane par iskaa asar hua or gramin ilaakon main vam kii paith majboot hui
 Similarly, in Gujarat, Modi, who has been described as the 'face of Hindutva', made many such decisions which benefited the common Gujaratis on a large scale
 khaskar bijli, sadak or chote shaharon main audyogikeekaran ne aam logon main unki ghuspaith majboot kii
 bjp's election victory in Gujarat for the sixth time under his leadership is proof that even today Modi's trusted face manages to pull people to the booth
 # 3
 So, like Bengal, in Gujarat too, the collapsing, long time Bengal and Gujarat have been strongholds for Left and BJP
 agar dekhen to jyoti ke satta se jane ke baad vam sarkaar ke khalaph jis tarah kii janabhaavana bani kuch-kuch waisi hi janabhaavana modi ke gujarat chhodane ke baad bhi najar ai
 Let us tell that after Buddhadev's arrival in West Bengal, the Left government approved industrial investment
 singoor (tata kii naino plant) or nandigram (chemical pariyojna) main iskaa virodh shuru hua
 The action of paramilitary forces against Maoists in Lalgarh also provoked public outrage
 jab tak vam sarkaar janabhaavana ko samaj paati kaaphi der ho chuki thi
 In 2006, Mamata Banerjee made it an issue and by 2011, she overthrew the Left government
 haalanki modi ke piem banane ke baad gujarat main audyogic virodh to nahin hua lekin kuch aise andolan khadey hue jisase logon kii janabhaavana bhadki
 First, the Patidars demanded backward reservation
 hardik patel ke netritv main patidaar anamat aarakshan samiti kaa gathan hua
 It had a widespread impact in the Patidar-dominated 83 assembly seats
 kai dinon tak virodh pradarshan or hinsa kii ghatnaayen milin
 This was followed by a case of oppression of Dalits by the guards in Una
 jignesh mevani ne isebijapi kekhilaaf gujarat samet puure desh main majboot andolan ke taur par khadaa kar diya
 He launched the 'azadi Cooch' campaign
 lekin aise vyapak andolanon ke baavjood bijepi ko 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main vaisaa nuksaan nahin hua jaisaa bengal main vam morche ne jhela
 this is due to
 # 4
 In this way Modi saved and made Gujarat impregnable
 When Modi and Khilafat started in Gujarat, Modi did not adopt the same attitude as the Left Front government in Bengal did
 patidaar andolan or oona kand ko dekhen to modi ne raajnneetik sujh kaa parichay diya
 Modi did not show haste when the Patidars came out on the road to provoke reservation and did not try to forcefully crush the movement
 patidaar bhadke nahin iske liye andolan chalane diya gaya or party ke patidaar netaaon ko aage kar maahaul narm banane kii koshish hui
 Anandiben was not immediately removed
 modi ke nirdesh par dhire-dhire thande dimag se patidaaron ke masale par bijepi ne kaam kiya
 The effect of this was that to a large extent, Hardik's movement did not ignite the flame as it does in other movements
 isi tarah oona main daliton ke khilaaf utpeedan ke maamle par bhi narendra modi ne bhavukta kaa sahaara liya
 His passionate appeal did not give the widespread response to Dalits that was much anticipated
 modi agle or paanch saal tak apana gujarat garh abhedya banaae rakhane main kaamyaab hue
 In 2017, BJP may have got less seats than last time in Gujarat but it should not be forgotten that history only remembers victory in the end

 apane vipaksh ke vakil ko labaar kehete hue usne apni chhattisgadhi hindi main jo tark or tathy bataae jinka uske vakil ne zikr tak nahin kiya tha
 He overturned the case and the verdict went in his favor
 labaar matlab jhootha
 In Bhojpuri, there is a word like Labra which means also false

 adaalat main translator kii vyavastha to hoti nahin tab atirikt seshan jaj ne zila jaj ko iske liye likhaa
 It turned out that the district court also does not have a translator
 zila jaj ne likhaa ki baar baar dilli sarkaar se anurodh karne par bhi kuch nahin kiya gaya he

 How long will Indian languages fight for themselves through public interest litigation

 He has no right to continue in his post, NRC is meant only for those who come from abroad

 Kapil Mishra said that it is absolutely wrong to tell the people of up-bihar out of the country and compare them to the intruders

 In the Rajya Sabha on Monday, Home Minister Amit Shah informed the Rajya Sabha about the abolition of many privileges under Section 370 and the proposal of restructuring the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 is khabar se desh bhar main jashn kaa maahaul he
 However, there are many who are opposing it
 kuch log apane tareeke se maje bhi le rahe hai
 The response of the film critique and actor Kamal Rashid Khan to the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir is interesting
 KRK ne twit main likhaa, "ab agar koi khubasurat kashmiri ladki mujhase shaadi karne ke liye taiyaar he to main vahaan par ek bada sa bangala kharidne ke liye taiyaar hum
 "KRK wrote," Let us live a beautiful life only in paradise on earth
 "kamaal ne apane duusare twit main likhaa, "mujhe modi raaj pasand nahin tha, kyonki vah apane vaade puure nahin kar rahe the
 Now i like him because he is fulfilling his promises and he has abolished Article 370
 main unase or pyaar karuunga agar vah apana doosraa vaada bhi puraa karenge ram mandir banavaa kar
 Because people have voted for him because of his promises
 "I didn’t like Modi’s rule because he was not full filling his promises
 Now i like him for full filling his promise and abolished # Article370! i will love him if he will full fill his 2nd big promise also and make # rammandir
 Because people gave him votes for his promises
 - KRK (@kamaalrkhan) August 5, 2019 Now, if any beautiful Kashmiri girl is ready to marry with me, then i am ready to buy a big bungalow there
 Let’s live a beautiful life in the Jannat on the earth only
 - KRK (@kamaalrkhan) August 5, 2019ppl shouldn't have doubt on Muslims for # Kashmirissue
 a single India Muslim is not against the removal of # Article370! Muslims are not allowed to buy property there
 Even Muslims are not allowed to marry with Kashmiri girls
 Means these Kashmiri Muslims don’t like us also
 - KRK (@kamaalrkhan) August 5, 2019india will never ever have more clever and powerful politicians than # amitshahji and # narendramodiji! They both are the biggest example of true friendship
 They both didn’t leave each other in a very bad time also and this is why, today, they are ruling the country
 # Salute👏 — KRK (@kamaalrkhan) August 5, 2019 i can understand if opposition politicians do oppose government's wrong act
 But i simply can’t understand that why are they opposing government for good work like removing # Article370to make India more strong
 Now Kashmir will have more investment, development and employment
 — KRK (@kamaalrkhan)august 5, 2019kamaal ne likhaa, "logon ko kashmir ke maamle main musalamaanon par shaq nahin karnaa chahie
 Not a single Muslim is against the removal of Article 370
 musalamaanon ko vahaan par property kharidne kii ijaajat nahin he
 Muslims are also not allowed to marry Kashmiri girls
 matlab ye ki ye kashmiri musalmaan hamen bhi pasand nahin karte hai
 "kamal Rashid Khan, praising PM Modi and Amit Shah, wrote," India will never have a smarter politician as Amit Shah and Narendra Modi

 " Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in the next year, in the assembly elections of Congress, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the BJP was dreaming of defeating the BJP handshake with a simple hand, but in a jolt, it has put Rahul Gandhi's aspirations on fire
 basapa adhyaksh ne buudhvaar ko saaf kaha ki teenon rajyon main congress ke saath unki partygathabandhananhin karegi
 If Mayawati adopts a similar attitude in UP too, it may prove difficult for the Congress to preserve its existence in the state
 centre kii satta hasil karne main upi kii ahmiyat sabase zyada he
 There are 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 yani centre main sarkaar banane ke liye jitani siten chahie, uski kareeb ek tihaai
 The BJP alliance won 73 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when its mission was successful 272 plus
 jabaki basapa kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa tha
 At the same time, the Congress was limited to Rae Bareli and Amethi and the SP could win only five seats of its family
 haalanki ye nattejey tab hai jab sapa, basapa or congress bijepi ke khilaaf alag-alag maidan main the
 In 2019, the leaders of the BSP, SP, RLD and Congress were talking about coming together to stop the path of BJP and PM Narendra Modi
 lekin mayawati ne teen rajyon main congress ke saath na aane kaa faisla lekar mahagathbandhan kii ummiido ko bada jhatka diya he
 It has also got wind of claims of opposition unity
 aise main 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main upi main bhi congress ke saath basapa rahegi, is par bhi ashanka ke badal hai
 If the BSP fights separately in UP in the 2019 elections, the Congress may have to face a big loss
 ise ham upi ke gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav ke nateezon se ham is baat ko samaj sakate hai
 The SP had the support of the BSP in both these seats, but the Congress was single-handedly in the fray
 congress ko akele ladanaa mahangaa padaa thacongress ko gorakhpur or phulpur siton par akele chunaav ladane kaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa tha
 The Congress fielded Surhita Karim in Gorakhupar, where his bail was also forfeited and he got only 18 thousand 844 votes
 phulpur loksabhaa seat par congress ne manish mishra ko maidan main utaara tha, jinhen mahaj 19 hajaar 353 mat mili the
 Whereas, with the support of the BSP, the SP managed to win both the Gorakhpur and Phulpur seats
 dilachasp baat ye he ki congress soobe main apane sabase bure daur se guzar rahi he
 Currently, Congress has two parliamentary seats and 7 mlas in UP
 ye nateeja tab tha jab loksabhaa chunaav main amethi or raibareli main sapa ne apane ummidavaaron ko congress ke khilaaf utaara nahin tha
 Apart from this, in the assembly elections, the SP had entered into an alliance with the Congress
 voton kaa sameekaran2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne akele dam par 71 siton ke saath 42
 63 percent of the votes were received
 jabaki sapa ko 22
 It won just 5 seats with 35 per cent of the votes
 basapa ko 19
 7 percent votes were received, but could not win a single seat
 vahiin, congress 7
 It could win only 2 seats with 53 per cent
 aise hi nateeja 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ko dekhen to bijepi ne 39
 It managed to win 312 seats with 7 percent votes
 jabaki basapa 22
 19 seats with 2 per cent votes, SP 47 and Congress 6 with 22 per cent votes
 2 fisadi vot ke saath 7 siten jiti thi
 Seeing the attitude of Congress President Mayawati to save her existence, it seems that she does not seem to be in the mood to form an alliance with the Congress in any way
 agar aisa hota he to phir congress ko akele maidan main utarana pad saktaa he
 In this situation, it will be a big challenge for the Congress to maintain its existence in the state

 mausam vibhaag ne anumaan jari kiya he ki saal 2018 monsoon ke lihaaj se behatar sabit hoga or saal ke dauraan pramukh dakshin-pashchimi monsoon lambii avadhi main ausatan 97 fisadi rahane ke asaar hai
 This assessment of the Meteorological Department has brought news of great relief for the farmers as it will strengthen the country's major Kharif crop, while this assessment has also brought great relief for the ruling Modi government at the Center
 acha monsoon kendra sarkaar ko agle saal 2019 main hone vaale aam chunaavon se pehle apane aarthik aankadon ko durust karne kaa mauka degaa
 What is a good monsoon? a normal, average or good monsoon means that about 96 per cent to 104 per cent of the average of the long-term average of 50 years
 50 varshon main ausat barish chaar maheenon ke monsoon ke dauraan 89 centimetre athwa 35 inch barish he
 This definition of a good monsoon has been given by the Meteorological Department
 vahiin 90 fisadi se kam barish desh main sookhe kii sthiti rahati he
 Significantly, the first two years of Prime Minister Modi's tenure were in 2014 and 2015, due to which there was a sharp decline in the country's economic data, for which the Central Government was strongly criticized
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik hi 110 fisadi barish bhi arthvyavastha ke liye thik nahin haalanki isse kamjor monsoon jaisaa nuksaan dekhne ko nahin miltaa
 Excessive rain increases the risk of crop damage and flooding in many areas of the country
 monsoon kii ahmiyatdesh main monsoon kii shuruyaat 1 june se dakshini chor kerala ke tat se hoti he or july ke madhya tak yah monsoon puure desh par chaa jaataa he
 The country gets about 70 percent of the total annual rainfall from this monsoon
 is barish se desh main pramukh kharif fasal chaaval, gehun, ganna, tilhan or soyabean kii paidaavaar nirdhaarit hoti he
 At the same time, the agricultural sector of the country based on these crops is 15 percent of the total GDP and about half of the country's population gets employment in this area
 ise padhein: upi main sharaab sankat, 'digital india' sahit in vajahon se khaali pade hai maykhaanelihaaja, acha monsoon desh main paidaavaar badhaate hue isapar aadhaarit desh kii 50 fisadi jansankhya kii vaarshik aamadani main ijapha karata he
 At the same time, with the increased income of this population, there is a big increase in the demand for consumer products in the country
 yah chakra aage chalakar desh main krishi se judi companiyon ke share bhav main ijapha karata he or saath hi saath gramin bharat main auto mobile (motor cycle, tractor, thresar ityadi) kii maang main bada ijapha karata he
 Economic data will improve in the country
 Good monsoon from June to July affects many sectors of the economy
 khaadya utpaadan main bharat swayan par nirbhar he lihaaja acha monsoon jahaan kharif fasal kii paidaavaar badhaata he vahiin kharaab monsoon or sookhe kii sthiti main sarkaar khaadya saamagree aayaat karne ke liye majaboor ho jaati he
 Therefore, a good monsoon reduces the government's import expenditure
 is kharch ko kendra sarkaar desh main inphra deveopment yaa moolbhoot suvidhaon ko muhaiyaa karaane ke liye swatantra rahati he
 These sectors will be a big benefit
 Good monsoon increases the income of farmers in rural areas of the country
 badi hui aamadani se kisaan tractor kharidne, scooter-motorcycle kharidne, bacchon kii shaadi ke liye sona-chaandi kharidne, bacchon kii padhai or ucch shiksha par kharch karne kaa kaam karte hai
 Due to this, along with the increase in the share of agricultural sector companies on the stock market, there is a good jump in the share of consumer product companies including auto sector shares, farm equipment companies shares
 ise padhein: modi sarkaar kii ye skim 2019 chunaavon main upi ke liye hogi game changer?majboot hogi bankintchhe monsoon se desh main banking vyavastha ko majbootee milti he
 Most of the farmers in the country arrange loans for kharif crops from government, cooperative or rural banks
 monsoon behatar hone kii sthiti main in bainkon ko karj par diya paisa waapas milane kii guarantee ho jaati he or unhen apane enpie ko kaabo karne main madad milti he
 At the same time, due to increased income of farmers, banks get good savings in the account of their rural branches, which makes the job of giving new loans to the non-agricultural sector easier
 mahangaai par lagegi lagamgauratlab he ki desh main aam chunaav april-may 2019 ke dauraan karaae jane kii sambhaavna he
 By this time, the good monsoon will have done its job and the farmer will be hoping for a good rabi crop after the income from the good kharif crop
 aam chunaavon se pehle yah doharaa bonus modi sarkaar kii ek baar phir satta main vaapasi karne main madad kar saktaa he
 While a good monsoon will improve many economic data of the country, the central government will also get a big relief in the field of inflation
 lihaaja in aarthik aankadon ke sahare kisi sattarudh sarkaar ko janadesh apane paksh main karne main zyada badi chunauti kaa saamana nahin karnaa padegaa

 upar se maharashtra to aisa rajya he jahaan fadanvis paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa karne vaale duusare siem rahe hai
 With Fadnavis's claims of success, the PM continued to surround the opposition throughout the campaign on the grounds that he (opposition) does not allow the new leadership to come forward

 BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj from Unnao, who had earlier surrounded the glorification of Godse, has again raised a new political controversy by making a controversial statement
 is baar ek saarvajanik manch se sakshi maharaj ne kah diya ki hindu mahilaon ko kam se kam chaar bachche paidaa karne chahie
 This statement by Sakshi Maharaj gives the opposition a new opportunity to attack the government
 congress ne buudhvaar ko aarope lagaaya ki pehle sabziyaan huin mahangi, phir bazaar main ai mandi or kisaanon kii aamadani hui kam or ab sakshi maharaj ke bayaan se lagata he ki bas nafrat failaane waalon ke aae achche din aa gaye hai
 Abhishek Manu Singhvi even said, BJP should tell if it is changing its agenda
 isse pehle kendriya mantri sadhvi niranjan jyoti ne "ye desh ramazaadon kaa he yaa ---zaadon kaa?" kahkar ram naam kaa apmaan kiya
 Then the BJP MP, Yogi Adityanath waged the controversy of Love Jihad and now Sakshi Maharaj has repeated the same stereotypes
 ye baat ki musalmaan chaar shaadiyaan karte hai or phir zyaada bachche paidaa karte hai, aapane bhi suni hogi
 But a man should marry one or four - a woman will produce as many children
 phir vah ek mard se shaadi kare yaa chaar mardon se
 This is absolutely simple mathematics
 duusari baat ye ki aap jab janaganana ke aankade dekhenge to ek chiz saafe ho jaaegi- ek se zyaada patniyaan hinduon main zyaada hai or musalamaanon main kam
 If the witness is able to explain the same, who is benefiting from this issue, but the opposition parties say that the BJP leadership will also have to answer that where the biggest leader does not dare to post Modi
 Is there, Sakshi Maharaj, Yogi Adityanath and Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti - from where are they daring to cross the Lakshman line again and again? bijepi ke sutara baar-baar kehete hai ki pradhanmantri aise betuke bayanon se naaraaz hai
 But the question is, when will the party take strong steps to stop these statements? sapana choudhary (sapna Choudhary) ke dance ne puure desh main tahalaka machaa rakhaa he

 The two rebels from the Congress who are disqualified are Ramesh Jarkiholi and Mahesh Kumatalli and an independent MLA r Shankar

 Ball in the court of Election Commission
 
 
 haalanki, spikar keaar ramesh kumaar ne kaha ki ayogy tehraae gaye vidhayakon ke kaarykaal par antim faisla chunaav ayog legaa
 Following this statement of the speaker, BJP leaders cited a statement given by the then Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat in 2018
 bijepi ne ravat ke is bayaan ke hawaale se kaha ki ayogy vidhayakon ke upachunaav main bhaag lene par koi roak nahin he
 He cited a case related to disqualifying All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) mlas in Tamil Nadu
 2018 main kya hua tha?2018 main palanisami sarkaar ke khilaaf baghawat karne par vidhansabha spikar pi dhanpal ne AIADMK ke 18 vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraaya tha
 This action was taken under the anti-defection law
 ye vidhayak AIADMK se alag nai party banane vaale titivi dinakaran ke samarthak paale main chale gaye the
 After disqualifying the mlas, Chief Election Commissioner Omprakash Rawat had said, 'all the seats have been vacated due to disqualification, and whenever a Vidhan Sabha seat is vacant, we have to hold a 6-month election (by-election)
 Therefore, the Commission will look into the matter in this regard
 'kumaraswamicongress ko faisle se khushispikar ke faisle kaa swaagat karte hue karnataka congress ke adhyaksh dinesh gundurav ne twit kiya, spikar ramesh kumaar ne teen vidhayakon aar shankar, ramesh jarkiholi or mahesh kumatalli ko maujuuda vidhansabha se puure kaarykaal ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar diya he
 Heartily welcome this decision

 Citing Shankar as the reason behind disqualifying the disqualified Shankar, the speaker said that he had merged his party KPJP with the Congress and later submitted his resignation to the Governor and supported the BJP
 congress netaa siddharmaiya or congress adhyaksh dinesh gundurav ne shankar ke khilaaf spikar ko shikaayat darj karai thi
 Significantly, a total of 17 mlas of Congress JDS had rebelled from the Kumaraswamy government and submitted their resignation to the speaker
 in vidhayakon kii baghawat kii vajah se mangalvaar ko 14 maheene puraani kumaraswami sarkaar gir gai thi
 Meanwhile, Karnataka BJP leaders met party president Amit Shah yesterday amid speculation of forming a government but could not take any decision
 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi bache hue 14 vidhayakon ko lekar spikar ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 After that, they will take any step towards forming a government in Karnataka
 yani, karnataka kaa naatak philhal jari rahane vaala he
 The BJP has been in power in Gujarat for the last two decades
 bijepi rajya main lagaataar chhathi baar jeet darj karke satta ke singhaasana par kabiz hui he
 The Congress may not have ended the exile of power in Gujarat, but it seems to be getting the best results in the last 22 years

 rajdhani kii sadakon par or jam lagegaa
 Not only this, car drivers coming from outside will also have problems
 aise log apni car kahaan park karenge
 For this, the help of volunteers will be taken, how can they handle it, who have not been given any training

 meraa maananaa he ki isse bhrashtachar bhi badhegaa
 The comments dilli main 15 saal tak sarkaar chalaa chukin shila ne kaha, isse dilli kii samasya or badhegi

 Where will such people park their cars
 iske liye walantirs kii madad lee jaaegi, vah kaise ise sambhaal paaenge, jinhen koi prashikshan tak nahin diya gaya he
 Sheila said that Kejriwal should have come up with a better and holistic plan to reduce or stop pollution, after deliberation, rather than implement the plan only to see it in a hurry
 shila ne kaha ki dilli ek aisa rajya he, jise chalaanaa sabake bas kii baat nahin he
 Only better and only Congress can deliver in Delhi
 anya log keval daawa kar sakate hai

 The two meet each other for the first time in college
 charming or khubasurat miti ko dekhakar sahil apana dil de baithta he
 Miti also starts liking Sahil, but the reason for her love is not Sahil's descent but money
 miti se do baar dhokhaa milane ke baad sahil exam ke vakt miti ko cheeting karte dekh letaa he or apane friend venu (jesi liver) ko ishaare main bataa detaa he
 Venu tells the teacher and the teacher takes Miti to the principal

 This film is the story of how Sahil teaches Mitti a lesson while staying in Mental Asylum, and whether he is successful or not
 badla lene main sahil or miti ke life ke kai raaj saamne aate hai
 Adorned with many twists and turns, the story of the film tells a good thriller story
 vardhan-shivalika kii umdaa actingcherag ruparel ne apni is psico thriller kahani ke liye do nae chehron ko liya he
 Both are new faces, but this thing cannot be felt by looking at their acting
 vardhan puri ne sahil ke role main bakhubi ek aise aadmi kaa chithran kiya he jo maasoom bhi he, gussa bhi uske dil main he, garlfriend se behad pyaar bhi karata he or eemaandaar hone ke baavjood bade hi shaatir tareeke se apana badla bhi letaa he
 On the other hand, Shivalika Oberoi also fits perfectly in Mitty's character
 unki acting kahin bhi fressure kaa ehsaas nahin dilaati he
 Ruslan Mumtaz and Jesse Lever have also done well in the supporting role
 aam kahani kii majboot lanchingdiarector cherag ruparel ne ek narmal ladke ke psico hone se lekar uske revange kii kahani ko salike se piroyaa he

 Overall, Cherag Ruparel has done a good job with two new faces

 In one scene of the film, Vardhan was seen repeating the scene of his grandfather Amrish Puri's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge

 Great music now comes on the song

 Vardhan appeared a little weak in terms of being romantic
 iske alaava 'sanakee' gaanaa jo film ke becoground main chalata rahata he badhiya he
 According to Sahil's gray shade and the mood of the scene, this song has been fitted in the right place

 Local bodies minister Mohindra said, 'I want to appeal to him (sidhu) that he should take charge of his department
 vah (urja mantralay) ek acha or shaktishaalee prabhaar he'
 Let us tell you that on June 6, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh withdrew the Department of Tourism and Cultural Affairs along with the urban body from Sidhu and gave him the charge of Energy and Renewable Energy Department
 amarinder ne siddhu se vibhaag waapas lete hue iske liye unke kharaab pradarshan ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha or iske baad se donon ke bich tanaav saarvajanik ho gaya tha
 Even a month after the cabinet reshuffle, Sidhu is yet to assume his new charge
 mohindra ne kaha ki prabhaar main pherbadal mukhyamantri kaa visheshadhikaar he, siddhu ko yadi koi shikaayat he to unhen prabhaar sanbhaalane ke baad mukhyamantri ke saath sulajhaa lenaa chahie tha
 BJP national secretary Tarun Chugh targeted Amarinder Singh and Sidhu and said that consumers in the state are being "affected" due to high electricity rates as both are face to face

 tippaniyan Earlier on Tuesday, there was a stir in the politics of Bihar when Lalu Prasad Yadav tweeted that the BJP should be happy with the new alliance partners
 lalu jhukne or darane vaala nahin he
 Till the last breath, i will keep fighting against the fascist forces
 is twit ke baad laga kahin gathbandhan khatre main to nahin he lekin is twit ke kuch der baad hi lalu yadav ne apane isi twit par jawaab dete hue likhaa ki zyaada laar mat tapakaao, gathbandhan atoot he
 Right now, more like-minded parties have to be joined together

 RSS-BJP is left shivering in the name of Lalu
 inako pataa he ki lalu inke jhooth, lut or jumalon ke kaarobaar ko dhwast kar rahaa he to dabaav banaao
 However, by the evening when the news of the break-up of the Grand Alliance did not stop in the media, finally RJD national spokesman Manoj Jha spoke to reporters
 jha ne kaha ki lalu prasad or rajd is prakaar kii gidad bhabhakiyon se darane vaale nahin hai

 The voice will not end and now Awam will take this fight in his hand
 isse pehle mangalvaar ko bihar kii raajnneeti main halchal much gai thi jab lalu prasad yadav ne twit kiya tha ki bijepi ko nae alliance parteners mubarak hon
 Lalu is not going to bow down and be afraid
 jab tak aakiri saans he fasivadi taaqaton ke kilaaf ladata rahoonga
 After this tweet, the alliance is not in danger, but shortly after this tweet, Lalu Yadav responded to this tweet and wrote that don't drip too much, the alliance is unbreakable
 abhi to samaan vichaardhaara ke or dalon ko saath jodna he
 i am not afraid of the BJP government and government allies
 RSS-BJP ko lalu ke naam se kanpakanpi chhootati he
 They know that if Lalu is destroying their lies, loot and jumlas business, then pressurize them
 haalanki shaam tak jab media main mahagathbandhan tuutane kii khabaron nahin thami to ant main rajd ke rashtriya pravaktaa manoj jha ne patrakaron se baatcheet kii
 Jha said that Lalu Prasad and RJD are not afraid of such jackal bhakbis
 hamen pataa he ki desh main kya ho rahaa he
 Lalu Prasad, Arvind Kejriwal, Mamta Banerjee's voice is being tried
 aawaaj khatm nahin hogi or ab awam is ladaai ko apane haath main legi

 The Congress is busy strengthening its position on the pretext of 'jan Akanksha Rally' in Bihar
 iske tahat hi party ne 30 saal baad aaj patna ke gandhi maidan main raily kaa aayojan kiya
 Other leaders of the grand alliance, including Tejashwi Yadav of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, attended this rally
 is raily ko sambodhit karte hue congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne modi sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He described the announcements made to farmers in the budget as an insult to them
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar puunjipatiyon ke liye to khub paise detii he, lekin kisaanon ko 17 rupee detii he
 This is an insult to the farmers
 rahul gandhi ne modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki notebandi duniya kaa sabase bada ghotaalaa he
 Modi says that he will give 15 lakhs to every man, but there is someone here
 unhone kaha ki bihar main vipaksh kii sarkaar aane vaali he
 There are deep reasons for this
 modi ji jahaan jate hai bade bade vaade kar jate hai
 Nitish ji has the same habit
 lekin vaade puure nahin kiye jate hai
 The Congress leader said that giving Rs 17 to the farmer is an insult to him
 tanj kasate hue congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki bajet main modi sarkaar ne badi ghoshnaa kii
 The BJP leaders said that they had taken a historic decision, and for five minutes they played a loud applause
 kisaanon ke liye unhone aitihaasik kaam kiya
 Modi ji is playing like a clap
 pataa he unhone kya aitihaasik kaam kiya he? kisaanon ko 17 rupee die or kisaan ke parivaar ke liye din ke saadhe teen rupee die
 
 
 So Modi ji's government gave these to the farmers and BJP ministers clap in Parliament
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki modi sarkaar annil ambani ko 30 hajaar karod rupee detii he, neerav modi ko 35 hajaar karod rupee or vijay malya ko 10 hajaar karod detii he, lekin hindustan ke kisaanon ko saadhe teen rupee detii he
 Is this the historic decision of Modi government? Rahul Gandhi said that Modi ji had promised 15 lakh rupees to the countrymen, but did the money come in anyone's account? The Modi government has insulted the farmer by giving Rs 17
 bihar ko phir gauravshaalee banaaengerahul gandhi ne kaha ki main jhootha vaada nahin karata
 Today the condition of Patna University is bad
 ham satta main aate hi patna uniwarsity ko kendriya vishvavidhyalay kaa darja denge
 He said that earlier Bihar used to be a center of education, today it is a center of unemployment
 aap gujarat jate ho, maharashtra jate ho to bijepi ke log aapako maar kar bhagaate hai
 We will make Bihar proud again
 congress netaa ne kaha ki pehle harith kranti punjab-haryana se shuru hui thi, ab main chahta hum ki agali harith kranti rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh main ho or isamen bihar kaa naam bhi shaamil ho
 i have told the Chief Ministers of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh to set up food processing units for the farmer
 agar aap hamen mauka doge to ham bihar ke kisaanon ko bhi samrudh banaaenge
 Tejashwi said - Rahul Gandhi will become PM, while Tejashwi Yadav while addressing the rally said that it is the responsibility of Congress President Rahul Gandhi how to take allies together
 kyonki sabko milakar bijepi ko haraana he
 During this time, Tejashwi Yadav lashed out at the Modi government and the BJP
 unhone kaha ki mere pita sher hai
 He is not afraid of his (BJP) Geedar Bhabki
 rajd netaa ne kaha ki log hamase poochhate hai ki aap rahul gandhi ko piem ke taur par sweekaar karenge
 i want to tell them that Rahul Gandhi is worthy of the Prime Minister
 vah yogya netaa he
 But he also has a responsibility to know how to walk with his colleagues
 gauratlab he ki manch par pahunchane se pehle rahul gandhi ne mahatma gandhi kii murti par pushp arpit kiye
 He then reached the stage, where he was welcomed by the leaders of the Bihar Congress and the Grand Alliance
 bataa den ki 30 saal baad congress ne patna main apane balboote is raily kaa aayojan kiya tha
 Earlier in 1989, late Congress leader Rajiv Gandhi organized a rally in this Gandhi Maidan
 congress ne is raily ko kaamyaab banane ke liye puri takat jhonk di
 The streets and squares of Patna were bridged with posters and banners
 congress ke vidhayak se lekar bihar ke kai vipakshi saansad is raily ko safal karne main jute rahe
 Congress strategy: In the general election 2019, very little time is left
 congress bihar main mahagathbandhan ke saath milakar pradhanmantri narendra modi or nitish kii jodi ko shikast dene ke liye bisaat bicha rahi he
 BJP and JDU have already done their trick by splitting 17-17 seats
 ab kaman rahul ke paas he
 Rahul is in the fray with a new strategy
 raily kii kamyaabi congress ke liye ek saath kai morchon par madadgaar hogi
 So 27 party mlas have given full force
 isse na sirf bihar main matadaataaon ko ek nayaa sandesh jayega balki sahyogiyon ke saath siton kii saudebaaji main bhi takat badhegi
 The NDA is eyeing this power show
 lekin saath hi mahagathbandhan ke dalon kii nazren tiki hai
 In fact, if the support of the Congress returns, it will directly affect the opponents as well as the allies

 After almost two years the cricket teams of India and Pakistan are going to be face to face once again
 yah donon timen champions trophy toornament main edbeston main aaj bhidengi
 But this match between the two teams can disrupt the weather
 match se pehle mausam se judi khabar yahi kah rahi he
 According to weatherdotcom, there is a 40 percent chance of rain during the day
 isi ke saath yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki ravivaar raat vahaan par barish ke asaar hai isse yah ho saktaa he ki donon deshon ke cricket phens ko maayusi haath lage yaa phir match kaa rigelt dakworth louis se nikaala jaae
 The second match of the tournament, which was played between Australia and New Zealand, also had to be stopped due to rain
 bharat-pakistan ke bich ravivaar ko hivoltage match hone vaala he
 Both teams are fully prepared
 donon desh kaa media or soshal media ek duusare ke khilaaf jang jaisaa maahaul banaae hue he
 It is being said that the match will be between Pakistan's bowlers and Indian batsmen
 udhar, pakistan ke visphotak ballebaaj shahid afridi ne bhi sweekaar kiya he ki is match main bharat kaa palada baari hoga
 Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming also called India a 'lion'
 in sabake bich ek factor aisa he jo is match main villen ban saktaa he or jis par cricket premiyon kaa abhi tak dhyaan nahin gaya he
 Team India also had to practice indoor due to rain
 itnaa hi nahin australia or pakistan ke bich warm ap match ko bhi keval 10
 Only 2 overs could be played
 edbeston main do abhyaas match main barish khalal daal chuki he
 The match played between India and New Zealand on 30 May was also hampered by rain and India defeated New Zealand by 45 runs in Duckworth Lewis method
 bharat ne newjiland ko 38
 He was piled on 189 for 4 overs
 iske jawaab main bharat ne jab 26 overon main teen wicket par 129 ran banaaye the tabhi baari barish ke kaaran khel rokna padaa
 After this, no further play was done and the Indian team started the tour of England in this way
 tippaniyan In 2013 also, rain was disrupted in the match between India and Pakistan
 is match main bharat ne pakistan ko 8 wicket se haraaya tha
 Let us know that a high-voltage match between India and Pakistan is going to happen on Sunday
 donon timen puri tarah se taiyaar hai
 The media and social media of both countries are creating a warlike atmosphere against each other
 kaha ja rahaa he ki yah match pakistan ke gendbaajon or bhartiya ballebaajon ke bich hoga
 On the other hand, Pakistan's explosive batsman Shahid Afridi has also accepted that India's match will be heavy in this match

 pej ke mutabik unhone is adhyayan ke liye 1971 se 2014 ke bich ke 3,500 se zyada ekadivasiy maichon ke aankade liye
 According to which the player becomes more defensive as he approaches a century or half-century
 ek baar shatak ke paar ho jane ke baad ballebaaj ke strike rate main 40 fisadi se bhi zyada kaa oochaal aa jaataa he
 This can sometimes make a difference in the outcome of the game

 There was a scene of murder all around
 afratfari thi
 Hindus and Sikhs were killed selectively in that part of the country
 logon kii sari jaaydaad luti jane lagi
 The biggest victims of this horrific scene were women and children
 isi bich jodh singh ke parivaar ko bhi apana jamaa hua kaarobaar chhod kar hindustan ke liye ravaanaa hona padaa
 Muslims attacked and Muslims saved
 
 
 sthitiyaan bhayaavah hoti ja rahi thim
 Village after village were becoming empty
 jodh singh kaa parivaar ne bhi faisla kiya ki ve apana sabakuch chhod kar kisi surakshit sthaan ke liye ravaanaa ho jaaenge
 Then some Muslims got intimidated
 unhone unke parivaar se kaha ki yadi ve unke dharm main shaamil ho jate hai to ve unki suraksha karenge
 But this thing was exasperated to the Sikh family
 haalanki unhone un musalamaanon ko pralobhan diya ki ve unki sari dhandaulat le len
 Just give them safe Hindustan
 jodh singh ke parivaar ne unhen kasam khilaayi
 Muslims accepted this and kept protecting them all the way
 raste main unhen kai or hamalavar samooh mili lekin un musalamaanon ne unhen surakshit sthaan tak pahunchaa diya
 He handed over the entire family of Jodh Singh to the Dogra Regiment of India

 Departed from Ludhiana from Gurudwara
 
 
 jodh singh or unka parivaar hindustan main lautne ke baad sharnaarthi kii tarah kai dinon tak gurudware main rahaa
 There he found many people from his village who were living around Ludhiana
 unase sat shri akaal karne ke baad unhone apane thikaane ko lekar poocha
 The villagers said that there are many houses in Ludhiana which are empty
 saath hi vahaan kaaphi jameen bhi khaali he
 If they want, choose someone as their home
 pehle saude ke taur par ek bhais kharidi
 
 
 Jodh Singh somehow came to Ludhiana but he had nothing to do
 tabhi unhone dekha ki hindustan se musalamaanon kaa ek jattha pakistan ke liye ravaanaa ho rahaa he
 The group also had an elderly Muslim who had an old buffalo
 us bujurg ko apane alaava is bhens ko sanbhaalane main badi dikkat aa rahi thi
 Jodh Singh greeted the elder and greeted the elder and asked if he would like to sell this buffalo
 bujurg ko to jaise bin maangi muraad mil gayi
 He offered 40 rupees
 unke paas vah bhi paise nahin the
 However the buffalo would have cost at least 200 rupees
 jodh singh ne apni bahan ke kaanon kii bali bech di
 In return he received 102 rupees
 unhone 40 rupee dekar vah bhens kharid lee
 It was his first deal and he never looked back after that
 ve dudharu pashuon ke kaarobaar main kud gaye
 Slowly, his business car started moving

 Along with the milk business, it also sprung into technology
 
 
 sardaar jodh singh ko punjab ke ludhiana se bengal ke kolkata aaye hue 68 ho gaye hai
 The business, which started from a stable, has now reached to technology

 uske bare main sabase zyaada baaten karte hai
 Want to know everything about him
 ye insaan kii fitarat he
 The nation of cricket is looking for an "icon" after Sachin Tendulkar's retirement, which he wants to make "god"
 viraat "chiku" kohli kii aseemit pratibha main cricket premi bhagwaan dhund rahe hai
 When Virat's anger erupts on the field over "sledding", the nation is proud of his "angry young man"
 eent kaa jawaab pathar se dene ke uske mizaaj kii janata divaani ho jaati he
 Even after being clean bowled, when Virat is not sure that he was out, he wants to salute his zeal to win and his zeal to never give up
 haar ke baad kisi ek cricketer ke chehre par sabase zyaada niraashaa padhi ja sakati he, to wo koi or nahin viraat kohli hi hote hai
 Virat Kohli has everything that a great player should have
 lekin viraat hai ki mahaan bananaa hi nahin chaahate
 It is sure to become 'big', but his sharp reaction to small things may not come as a speed-breaker in the way of his becoming 'great'
 world cap ke semifinal main haar ke baad unki garlfriend anoushka sharma ko lekar soshal media main jo kuch bhi hua, us par viraat bifare hue the, jo jaays bhi he
 His anger broke out in Kolkata, "I feel so sad
 jinhone aisa kaha unhen shame aani chahie
 "virat was so angry that he even went on to say that after this incident he was identified as good and bad people," this price of poor performance in a match? The reactions to me were extremely disappointing
 kai logon par se meraa vishwaas uth gaya
 Well done in a way
 pataa chal gaya ki koun mere saath he or koun nahin
 "but isn't Virat overemphasizing the antics of such a handful of naughty people? BBC journalist Stephen Shemilt was asking Australia captain Michael Clarke during the World Cup
 bataur captain jabardast "saxes" mili he
 
 
 But Shemilt's tongue stuttered and "sex" came out of his mouth instead of "success"
 clark or press conference main mauzood steven smith ke saath sabhi log hans pade
 Clarke's eloquence and rhetoric can be learned
 unhone kaha ki "sex" kaa sawaal to unki patni se poocha janaa chahie!hajaaron yuva cricketer kii tarah kohli, sachin tendulkar ko apana adarsh maanate rahe hai
 They have grown up watching Sachin play
 karodon khel premiyon kii tarah kya kohli ko bhi ye ummid nahin rahati thi ki sachin shatak banaakar hi lautenge? Virat Kohli is expected to do the same
 isliye unke form kaa paimaana duusare khilaadiyon se alag hota he
 Taking a dig at the media, Kohli said that there are different scales on the players' form
 kisi khilaadi ke liye ek paimaana to duusare ke liye kuch or
 "if i play poorly in two matches, my form starts to be described as poor
 kuch khilaadi 10 maichon main 2 match acha khelkar bhi form main bane rahete hai
 "for 24 years Sachin Tendulkar kept speaking in the cricket world, but he himself spoke very little
 har sawaal kaa jawaab unke balle ne diya
 Do you remember that in 2006, a critic wrote "andulkar"
 sachin phir bhi khmosh rahe or agle 7 saal tak khelte rahe or aalochak munh chhupate rahe
 "in the last 5 years no one has won more matches than me
 mujhe nahin lagata ki team main kisi kaa bhi pradarshan mujhase behatar rahaa he
 "when Virat Kohli makes such a statement, he feels less confident, more arrogant
 viraat ummiido vaale kohli "mahanata-path" par bhatakate hue nazar aate hai

 Let me tell you that the right to vote was taken away from Bal Thackeray in the 90s
 un par aarope lage the ki unhone ek jansabha main dharm ke naam par vot dene kii apil kii thi
 The Prime Minister said in Latur on Tuesday that parties like the Congress which promotes dynasty should learn from Bala Saheb
 narendra modi ne bal thakare ko apana bada bhai bataaya or kaha ki shiv sena ke sansthaapak bala sahib ne kabhi apane ko mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar nahin mana or na hi apane bade bete ko iske liye kabhi aage badhaayaa
 The Congress reacted sharply to Modi's assertion and said that what the Prime Minister said in his speech was a false fact
 bal thakare kaa vot dene kaa adhikaar congress ne nahin chhina tha, balki chunaav ayog ne chhina tha
 For the first time in the history of India, one's franchise was taken away because Bal Thackeray was giving provocative speeches continuously after the 92 riots

 ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue narendra modi ne kaha ki unke party kaa ghoshnaptr agle paanch varsho ke liye he, jabaki congress ke ghoshnaptr kaa astitv 23 may ko samaapt ho jayega, jab loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aaenge
 The Prime Minister gave this statement in response to a tweet by Congress President Rahul Gandhi in which he described the bjp's manifesto as un visioned
 rahul ne kaha tha ki congress kaa ghoshnaptr vichaar-vimarsh ke baad taiyaar kiya gaya he
 a manifesto made with the voice of about 1 million people is powerful and sensible
 narendra modi ne iske jawaab main congress ke chunavi ghoshnaptr ko vot paane ke liye 'dhakosla patr' qaraar diya, jabaki unhone bijepi ke sankalp patr ko matadaataaon kaa bataaya

 Is it necessary that the government give evidence of the people killed in the airstrikes in Pakistan? The message went awry as the government claimed to have eliminated a large number of terrorists and put the death toll up to 300 which does not seem to be true

 If the government had said in the beginning that the purpose of this attack was to show Pakistan that we can penetrate its air security and have shown it by working then it would have been right

 We do not have a system of presidential elections
 matadaata sansad ke sadsy kaa chunaav karte hai, na ki desh kaa chif agxcutive afasar
 If we look at these two leaders, the style of leadership of both of them seems quite opposite — one, like a white horse rider and a sword-wielding hero who claims that he has the answers to all the questions

 The party formed the government with the help of BSP, Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (ukrand) and three independent mlas

 BJP MLA Malchand from Purula, Uttarkashi and Bhimlal Arya, MLA from Dhanaulti, Tehri, openly praise the Congress
 haalanki modi lahar par savaar hokar bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav main paanchon siton par jeet hasil kar lee thi

 The reason for seeking the divorce was that the wife had hidden the matter of getting the husband to get breast surgery before marriage, due to which she later gained a lot of weight
 pati ne shikaayat kii thi ki patni kii samasya kii vajah se vah vaivaahik jivan kaa anand nahin le saktaa
 In the petition, the husband alleged that the weight of the wife started increasing rapidly after marriage
 uskaa tark tha ki usne patni ko ilaaj karaane ke liye samajhaayaa, lekin patni ne sahyog karne se manaa kar diya
 He said that his wife often refused to do housework and then he had to do that work
 usne aarope lagaaya ki patni ne uski icchhaaen kabhi puri nahin kii or patni hone kaa daayitv nahin nibhaayaa
 However, the court said that the husband had accepted that their marriage had reached perfection
 nyaayamurti emes sonaak or eyes oka kii peeth ne kaha ki uski (pati kii) shikaayat sirf yah thi ki uski patni kaa vajan adhik tha or yah baat talaak kaa aadhaar nahin ho sakati
 The court also said that the husband's allegations reflect the normal ups and downs of the marital life that the wife was quarrelsome and stubborn
 adaalat ke anusaar, yah baat talaak kaa aadhaar nahin ho sakati
 After marriage, the couple moved to Pune
 rishton main tanaav ke baad pati ne parivaar adaalat main talaak ke liye aavedan diya
 The court turned down the application
 iske baad pati ne hoicourt main aavedan diya, jisane uski apil is aadhaar par khaarij kar di ki vajan main vruddhi talaak kaa aadhaar nahin ho sakati
 The husband said that he had met the wife through a marriage bureau in Solapur
 uske anusaar, patni ne form main yah khulaasa nahin kiya ki usne breast surgery karai thi
 Her weight increased after marriage due to surgery

 With this, Washington has become the first city in America where Sikh policemen will be seen working with religious symbols
 is niti kaa nirmaan sikh american legal dephence and ajukeshan fund (eseeldf) ke sahyog se kiya gaya he
 According to this the policemen will wear uniform color turban which will have a badge of the department

 leonnelle mesi jab 11 saal ke the to unke parijanon ko unka shaareerik vikaas ruk jane ke kaaran chikitsiya paraamarsh lenaa padaa tha
 Messi, the father of Jorge and mother Celia, is leading his country's team to the final of the FIFA World Cup today after 16 years, following in the footsteps of his football icon Diego Maradona
 samachar agency sinhua ke mutabik, vikaas ke liye jaruri hormones main kami ke kaaran mesi ke parijan chikitsak se yah poochne gaye the ki kya mesi itane lambey ho sakenge ki vah footbal khel saken
 Then the doctor's reply was, 'don't worry, one day you will be taller than Maradona
 footbal main tum unase behatar to nahin hooge, lekin tum unase lambey jarur ho jaaoge
 ' vastav main mesi apane adarsh maradona se puure chaar centimetre lambey hue
 But after 16 years, Messi is bent on completely refuting what was said by the doctor at that time
 ravivaar ko mesi fifa vishwa cap-2014 ke khitaabi mukaable main germany ke khilaaf apni team kaa netritv karne utrenge
 This will be another big achievement for Messi, who has already won his talent in football
 barsilona ke liye 2004 main kariyar kii shuruyaat karne vaale mesi tab se ab tak teen baar yuapha champiens lig khitaab, chah laa liga khitaab or do baar spanish cap hasil kar chuke hai

 dakshin africa main hue pichley vishwa cap main bhi mesi koi gol nahin kar sake or unki team quarter final main ek baar phir germany se haar gai
 In view of his performance for Argentina, many people started saying that there could be no comparison of Maradona with Messi
 maradona ne vastav main apane dam par 1986 main argentina ko vishwa vijeta banaaya tha
 The following year he managed to travel to the final in the World Cup, but had to lose to Germany and lost the title
 aise main is bahes ne ek baar phir jor pakad liya he ki kya mesi ravivaar ko marakana stadium main yah sabit kar paaenge ki vah diggaj argetini khilaadi maradona se behatar hai
 The then German coach Franz Beckenbauer, who defeated the Argentine team in the World Cup-1990, said on Friday, 'it is a very difficult comparison
 lekin maradona tab aaj ke mesi kii tulana main kahin behatar khilaadi the
 It is said that this is similar to Messi's last litmus test

 When an alleged Naxalite is arrested, against whom there is no evidence of involvement in any violence, the police often seize 'naxalite literature' from him as a crime-proof
 is ‘sahitya kii pratinidhi rachanaaon’ kaa kabhi khulaasa nahin hota, lohe kaa kaala band baksaa adaalat main pesh hota he uske baad thane ke malkhane main
 One such arrest was made recently here in which 'a lot of Naxal literature' was recovered
 jugad se ‘pratibandhit rachanaayen’ darshanath huin
 Brekht's poems, postcards of Bhagat Singh, Marx, Angle etc
 ‘kya julmaton ke daur main geet gaaye jaayenge / haa, julmaton ke daur ke hi geet gaaye jaayenge
 "your paws are afraid to see the bad man / Your beauty is happy to see the good man / i would like to hear about your poem
" brekht kii prasiddh kavitaaon ke card
 a khakihari asked what is Naxalite literature in it, his boss was shocked
 aisa nahin bos kii dushmani he abhiyukt se, vah puri shiddat se maanata he ki yah pratibandhit chijen hai or adhik maatra main kisi ke ghar se unki baramadagi uskaa maovadi hona sabit karti hai
 Argue him and he will tell with full sincerity that he has got his transfers in these difficult areas only to free the society from fear and provide security to all
 baat aage badhegi to dand samhita or akhir main bharat kaa samvidhan, jisaki kai pratiyaan uski kursi ke peeche book shelf main chamakati hai, aapke saamne bicha degaa
 Yes, it will not tell why he keeps so many copies of the same book
 uski morrkhtaa-mudhata ke kisse akashwani se prasaarit kijiye, uski naadaani par tarasiye yaa uske virodh main likhiye
 He considers himself your only protector
 kaisaa bhi pratirodh, jab tak vah samvidhan-sammat na ho yani maanavadhikaar ayog se aaye notice kii shakl main na ho, uski sanvaidhanik chamadi ko khurachataa tak nahin
 xxrep 4 - March only
 satta jivan ko virdohi dhruv main vibhajit hua maanati he
 If you are not in favor, then you are the inevitable opposition to power
 shatru hai
 a police officer taking the oath of the constitution, no matter how dishonest that oath has proved to be in its execution, understands things in only two ways - constitution-conscious or hostile
 kavita bhi uske anusaar samvidhan kii raksha ke liye hogi yaa todane ke liye
 Remember, he is not a cruel, barbaric stereotyped khakihari, a man of faith and humanity
 is vibhaajan rekha se pare kii chijen uske liye myne nahin rakhti, darasal astitv main hi nahin aati
 There is life beyond constitutional articles, it does not accept biological-mental laws
 lekin yah uskaa anuvanshik gunasutra nahin he
 Till the college days, when he used to play guitar, he was so familiar with this book that it was written by Bharat Ratna Babasaheb Bhimrao Dr
 Ambedkar and copies of it were hung in the right hand of the blue idol installed in the fields, mohallas of North India
 sangh lok seva ayog kaa pavitra imtihaan uteern kar yah granth jatke main us guitaravadak kaa sanchaalak, abhivavak ho gaya
 Such a rapid conversion is difficult
 uski is vidhanandhta kaa aap lutf bhi le sakate hai ki bechaare kii bukshelf main dandsamhita or sakshya adhinium ke sivaay kuch nahin, sunaane ke liye mahaj muthbhedon ke kisse jo adhikansh farji yaa maanavadhikaar ayog kaa notice jhel rahe hai
 He is unaware of Godard and Kumar Gandharva, a lower being
 lekin samvedansheel, sarvyaapee drushti hone ke gurur main jiti kala kyon is vardidhari par antim nirnay sunaaye? kavita vidrohi or baagi kii anivaary sangini rahi he
 He always proposed himself as the last opposition to power, but did this inevitability allow his view to be fair? If power is the biggest kufr for the word, then the connection of all-time suspicion with power is also not a word
 or agar andeh ko shabd kaa dharm maan dhaaran kiya he to shuruyaat khud apni nigaah par, manyata par andeh se kerani chaiye
 Then perhaps even the unseen aspects of power will appear, challenging the establishments
 masalan ki ranbhumi main reporting karte patrakaron kii sabase adhik madad police hi karti he, unhen khatre se bachaati he
 If there is no facility of internet, fax, photo scanning etc
 somewhere in the forest, then the office of the SP or Collector is a support for sending news
 thane ke janarator se camera or laptop kii bydaree charge kii jaati he
 The policeman knows that the news reporter is typing on his office computer, will go against the administration itself that he who is scanning the paper secretly
 darasal thane kii hi kisi file se udaaye huye hai, tasviren hadabadi main bhej rahaa he wo hawalat main band kisi chotil kaidi kii chupake se khinchi gai tasviren hai jo akhbaar main chhapate hi pamaada ho jaayegaa lekin thanedaar andekha kar detaa he
 Even if the soldier signs, he says- 'let it be done, there are media people
 
 
 kaam kar rahe hai apana
 
 
 All will be well 'achambha lagegaa lekin durgam jagahon main reporting bagaiyr police-prashasan kii khufia madad ke asambhav he
 These are the moments of intelligence when khaki relaxes its scripture, giving you the opportunity to attack it
 agar sarvamaanya krur khaaki apane samvidhan main apwaad or apatkaal kaa sthaan bachaaye huye he to kya swaghoshit samvedansheel kala ko satta ke prati apni nigaah or sambandh par punarvichaar nahin karnaa chaiye? jab kavi bas driver main pita talash letaa he, stearing ke saamne latakati chuudi main uski bitiyaa kaa aks dekh jaataa he to bandookdhaari se chuaachhut kyon? lahana singh bhi to sipaahi tha
 Secondly, the defect of the soldier is so much that he is living with the ultimate faith in any one book
 kisi granth ko aakhri maan lenaa, bhale vah ishwariya satta pratipaadit karata ho yaa kisi vichaar purush kii adipustak, sristi ko vipareet dhruvon main vibhajit kar detaa he
 If you have to live in a regulatory system, then there has to be a book, which will give legitimacy to that entire structure
 aap adam smith ko uddhrut karen, gita, marks yaa hind swaraj ko
 Even the smallest component of the system will do itself with a verified administrator
 isaliye yaa to har kism kii vyavastha se baahar nikliye or agar vyaavhaarik-saamaajik kaarak batalaayen ki dhaancha bevikalp he to phir is dhaanche ke prati anivaary dwandv kaa sambandh bekaar he
 You will have to find the point where the opposite element can also be communicated
 aakhir kitne kavi honge jo aapako apane ghar main sammaan se bithaayenge, mej kursi, kaagaj-pan, computer-scinar denge ki aap uske virodh main likh saken, use benakaab kar saken?patjhar
 Pat Water ab na jhar
 --- When did you come? --- Darkness in the morning, you only said to meet under the dead
 
 
 kahaan tha? sab log aa gayi dekh
 
 
 Mahua Sara will end --- koi nahin, bahut gira he aaj
 Let's start
 patjhar ke din hua karte the
 There was a waterfall in their forest, Autumn
 subah chaar se dopaher gyaarah tak mahua tapakataa
 Small white flower
 dharti par bikhar jaataa
 The mahue tree used to be empty
 donon jaldi uth jate
 Mahua bean used to be filled in baskets among the dry red leaves scattered below
 ajab tha yah vriksh
 The whole year hangover would pour in this season
 nashe ke beej ve dharti se binte
 The whole year's Hasrat used to gather behind his hut
 mahue ke jaadui lattu kii nok pe raat thirakati
 The forest was their mascara, the river wet lake where they sunk their bodies
 beete pattey the wo lekin
 This January he was found dead in a police station
 pulisiye bole naksali tha, faansee laga hawalat main aatmahatya kar lee
 Several miles away, the entire village came ripping through the forest
 sadak par
 After the post-mortem, the corpse was moving from Jagdalpur to Dantewada in the government ambulance
 ambulance ne jaanboojh kar lanbaa rasta liya tha ki gaanv waalon se batch jaye, chupchaap uskaa sanskaar ho jaye
 But news was made to everyone, the road was stopped after logging
 ambulance ai thi
 Virat Chitrakar, Vikral Rudan gaanv kii auraten gaadi ke andar chadhin thim- kaanch ke neeche safed main lipati ek deh
 Women used to beat the glass with fists
 kaanch par kaanch takaraata tha
 Bangles were cracked, the glass of the coffin was strong
 sarkari tha shaayad isaliye
 She was sitting with her head bowed on the roadside
 chup potli
 Shamelessness vah mujhe nahin jaanati thi
 She did not know i came there from Raipur ten hours away at night, i have a medical report of her husband that she was beaten up before death, her genitals were swollen, never against her in any station of Bastar
 No case was registered, he had no name, he had no rope in the lockup to hang, just a shawl which he saw to rip the door itself just three feet Photo of the shawl that had leg lift log is too close to me and lock the door
 bekhbar vah chup baithi thi
 Save the insignia of 'naxalite' husband
 bahon kii jakad main fanse ghutane ke bich sir jhukaaye
 The next morning my newspaper printed her picture on the front page, along with the news - a pregnant woman waiting for her corpse
 duusare din maanavadhikaar ayog kaa rajya sarkaar ko notice aa gaya tha
 This is but two months old
 pattey is baras phir jharte hai
 Mahua drips again
 aaj atharah march kii subah vah akeli tokari lekar jaati he safed phool binti he
 He is still the same
 chupchaap
 The bulge on the stomach is slightly higher
 shaayad
 Two hundred and forty days' progeny also do not show their presence on his body
 bhukh kaa garbhashastra yah
 Appetology of the womb
 mahanagareey stri ke itane ubhaar par shaayad kaha jaayegaa- thodi moti ho gai ho, dieting karo
 The children of metros make their declarations before the hundredth day
 daurbalya banaam saushthav kaa dwandvatmak vidhaan janm se pehle nirdhaarit ho jaataa he
 This moment misses the women of her family who have lived
 gherdaar goun pahenti hai
 She moves with surprise
 dinabhar kuch tungti rahati hai
 She is single but mahua beati
 khud ko khud hi sambhalati he
 Silently
 ghani pahadiyon ke bich
 The day before, she has to go to the collector's office in a staggering bus for two and a half hours, to be in line at Babu's window to get her husband's death certificate
 kai martabaa pehle bhi ja chuki he lekin taarikh aage bad jaati he
 The woman who went to collect the death certificate of the 'naxalite' husband gave birth to the girl in a moving bus
 kya yah bhi hona baaki he? kai saal beetenge, bacchee bhi mahua binaa karegi
 Will ask her father
 jab vah frock pahanane lagegi, ek din maa use us thane le jaayegi, jahaan pita ne shawl gale se lapet khud ko khatm kar liya tha
 'nirmal had once written Mahue's smile, Mahue's death would have been appropriate
 'uskaa thodaa padhaa devar madras main apana kaam chhod yahaan aa gaya he
 When he saw me walking in this area, he immediately recognized - you came only in January
 apane ghar le gaya, bolaa ab yaheen rahegaa, bade bhai kii mrityu ko marane nahin degaa
 i want to tell what he is stuck on the ground
 pichley do maheenon main vah postmortem report tak nahin hasil kar paaya he
 This struggle is internal, it gives nothing but self-satisfaction
 tike rahane kii santushti faqat, use bhi agar kuredo to bheetar sirf kori hawa dikhti he
 Cold, dry air that leaves white flowers scattered
 use nahin maaloom aatmavishwast purusharth kii jis argani par usne yah laash taang di he, vah kitni kamjor he
 As the years pass, while living in Paramapara, he will be able to do more and more so that a single memorandum will be given to the Collector, SP or local councilor or MLA
 us gyaapan kii photostate pavati par sarkari mohar hogi jise vah apni file main sahej rakhega, mujh jaise kabhi yahaan aayenge to dikhalaayegaa
 Will tell the whole story from the beginning
 ek raat aakhir argani tuutegi, suukh chuki laash bharbharaati giregi
 This moment also destroys the pride of word-masculinity, forcing one to accept that the word is an inanimate entity
 swantah sukhaay, svakendrit
 The word reach is just the word, its intended word, target word, achieved word
 vahi jo sampadak dilli se kehete hai- hameshaa yaad rakho, tum mahaj ek reporter ho
 Reporter only
 hathiyaar kahaan shabd bakhtarband bhi nahin he
 The word is actually wordless

 The villagers also informed the police about any untoward incident

 All this was going on and the police were waiting that the boy suddenly jumped from the cliff holding the girl's hand
 gaanvvaale kisi tarah chattaanon par chadhakar pehle ladki tak pahunchate hai or use bachaate hai
 Later on the police arrive, the boy is also rescued
 ladkaa 19 saal kaa he or polytechnic main padhata he
 The girl is said to be a minor there

 -input IANS se After reducing the price of petrol, the government is now preparing to reduce the price of diesel
 grih mantri rajnath singh ne yah baat kahi
 He said that the government is working towards fulfilling the promises made in the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone palaval ke hathin main ravivaar ko ek jansabha main kaha ki ham is disha main prayatnsheel hai
 We have cut the price of petrol by two and a half rupees
 ab hamaari nigahen dijal par hai
 Under the plan to bring diesel prices at market rates, now the difference between the government controlled price and the market price has almost disappeared
 sarkaar ne pehle hi kaha he ki iske baad dijal kii keemten diregulate kar di jaaengi
 This means that the government will neither increase nor decrease its prices
 dijal kii keemten bhi petrol kii hi tarah tel companiyaan nirdhaarit karengi
 It will depend on the price of crude oil and dollar rates
 yani kachche tel kii antarrashtriya keemton main giravat aane par yahaan dijal ke daam gir jaaenge
 In this way, the price of petrol and diesel will now depend on the market forces
 aarthik sudhaaron ke tahat sarkaar ne yah tay kiya tha ki petrol-dijal main kisi tarah kii sabsidi nahin di jaaegi
 Under this, diesel prices were increased by 50 paise every month

 It can be seen in the video that most of the tourists are laughing at seeing the lion, and are also trying to touch him with love, but a female tourist is quite scared, and she jumps out of the car

 ) Shiv Sena's occupation on the Konkan politics, bjp-shiv Sena has more seats than the BJP in Talkhikonakan, Shiv Sena has a keen eye on the political mood of the Konkan region along the west coast in Maharashtra assembly elections
 maharashtra kii siyasat main bijepi bhale hi shivasena ke bade bhai kii bhoomika main chunavi maidan ho, lekin konkan ilaake main to shivasena kii hi tuuti bolti he
 This is the reason why the Shiv Sena has contested more seats in the Konkan region than the BJP
 aise main dekhnaa he ki is baar ke siyaasi sangram main shivesna apana durg bachaae rakh paati he yaa nahin?konkan kshetra shivesna kaa gadhbata den ki 2014 ke chunaav main konkan rigen ke tahat aane vaali 39 siton main se shivasena ne sabase zyada 14 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 At the same time, BJP got 10 seats, Congress 1, NCP 8 and others 6 seats
 jabaki shivesna or bijepi alag-alag chunaav ladi thi
 Despite the Modi wave, the Shiv Sena had fully retained its political supremacy in its area
 bijepi se zyada siton par shivenamaharashtra ke konkan ilaake main palghar, thane, raigarh, mumbai, ratnagiri or sindhudurg jile aate hai
 Konkan region has a total of 39 assembly seats
 yahshivasna kaa shuru se hi majboot gadhmana jaataa he
 In this election, the Shiv Sena is in the fray for 25 seats in the Konkan region under the bjp-shiv Sena alliance, while the BJP is tapping the electoral table in 11 seats
 bijepi konkan kshetra main uddhav thakare ke netritv vaali shivasena kii tulana main kam siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 Whereas, under the congress-ncp alliance, the Congress is contesting on 15 seats in the Konkan region, the NCP has fielded candidates in 24 seats
 is tarah se ensipi konkan rigen main congress se zyada siton par chunavi maidan main utari he
 Interestingly, there is a contest in most seats between BJP vs Congress and NCP vs Shivsena
 rifinary ratnagiri bana chunavi muddakonkan ilaake kii nanar rifinary ratnagiri main ek chunavi mudda bana hua he
 The opposition to the proposed refinery project at Nanar in Ratnagiri district has also been the reason for opposition between the Shiv Sena and the BJP
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki arabon rupee kii rifinary pariyojna se konkan kii najuk paristhitiki par bura asar padegaa
 This is the reason why the BJP is forced to say that the Nanar Refinery Ratnagiri can be removed, considering the political mood
 konkan ilaake shivasena-bijepi kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he
 The situation of the BJP and Shiv Sena is seen to be changing due to the change of face of many leaders of opposition parties before the assembly elections
 konkan kshetra main sabhi aath nagar nigamon main shivasena-bhaajapagathabandhan kaa kabja he
 The Shiv Sena dominates Thane, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg
 vahiin, bhaajapa ne bhi 2014 ke baad se thane or palghar main bhi kamyaabi ke jhande gaade hai
 Through Rane, bjp's eye on Konkan, Congress and Sharad Pawar-led NCP has reduced its base in the region
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad is kshetra main congress-ensipi ke kai maujuuda vidhayak paala badalte hue bijepi yaa shivasena main chale gaye he
 Both these parties have also fielded these rebels
 bijepi kii konkan ilaake par puri najar he
 This is the reason that despite the opposition of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, BJP has included Narayan Rane in the party and fielded his son Nitesh Rane
 aise main dekhnaa he ki konkan kaa kila koun fatah karata he? Rajkumar Hirani, the director of PK, one of the successful films of Hindi cinema, says that he is not too worried about the film's earnings at the box office
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki acchhee film kaa paimaana kamai nahin hoti he
 On the special screening of the film 'masaan', Hirani said, 'the film should not be judged by box office earnings
 kai filmein box offis par acchhee kamai karti hai lekin log agle hi din uske bare main bhul jate hai
 At the same time, a good film stays in our mind for years even if it does not do much business

 The film stars Sanjay Mishra, Richa Chadda, Vicky Kaushal, Shweta Tripathi, Saurabh Chaudhary, Vineet Kumar, Pankaj Tripathi and Nikhil Sahni
 unhone kaha, 'film behad khubasurat he, bahut achche se likhi or banaai gai he
 All the actors have done a good job
 vastav main mujhe pataa nahin tha kifilm kii kahanikya he, lekin ab ise dekhne ke baad main kah saktaa hum ki maine film kaa puraa anand liya
 ' tivi actress pratyusha banerjee khudakushi maamle main ek nayaa mode aane se unke boyfriend rahul raaj singh par aaropee hane kaa shaq or bhi gaharata ja rahaa he
 Rahul's lawyer Neeraj Gupta thought it better to withdraw from the case
 aaj tak dot com ke saath unhone phone par exclusive baatcheet kii
 During this, he exposed many surprising things related to the case
 aaie janeniraj guptane is cese se hatane kii kya badi chaunkaane vaali vajahen bataayin:rahul ke maa baap kaa vyavahaaravah chaahate the ki main unke mutabik hi sab chijen karun jaisaa wo kahen vaisaa main karun
 Now you tell me that if the patient comes to the doctor, will the doctor go according to the patient? They wanted me to follow them and not work in my own way
 wo chaahate the ki main 24 ghante rahul ke saath hi rahunrahul kemata-pitaane mujhe yah bhi kaha ki rahul jab tak hospital main hai tab tak main unheen ke saath hospital main banthu
 Is it possible that i stay in the hospital with my client from morning to night? i am a lawyer
 mere paas or bhi bahut se cese hai
 In this case, i did whatever responsibility i had
 rahul ko police ke saamne pesh karne vaala bhi manhi tha
 Rahul hid the first wife of Sachrahul's parents and Rahul himself also hid the talk of his first marriage to me
 mujhe to media se hi maaloom padaa ki unki pehle ek hair hostes ke saath ho chuki thi or unka ek betaa bhi he
 So my point is that how can you hide all these things from your lawyer
 unki pehali patni ke bare main main philhal zyada nahin kahana chaahunga
 Just say that she loved Rahul very much
 is bare main baaki jaankaree main jald hi media ke saath share karuunga
 Kiarahul's parents refused to talk to the media even prevented me from talking to the media
 lekil jab aap par media ke jariye tamaam sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai to aapaki javabdehi banati hai to aise aap kaise media se munh mode sakate hai
 Where did Pratyushaka's money go? It was also strange that Rahul's father used to send two to four thousand rupees to Pratyusha
 ab sawaal uthta he ki ek jaani-maani actress kya sach main hajaar rupee kii mohataaj ho gai thi
 It is not that they did not make money
 sawaal yah uthta he ki unka paisa kisne istemaal kiya
 Pratyusha's poor economic condition is responsible for every person who used his money, be it Rahul or his family
 mere upar kisi kaa dabaav nahin hehamane niraj gupta se sawaal poocha ki industry or zyaadaatar log pratyusha kii maut ke liye rahul ko hi aaropee maan rahe hai
 So did you think it better to be out of the case due to this pressure? He said, 'if that had happened, i would not have fought for this case beforehand
 jab maine yah cese pakadaa to mujhe industry ke kai logon ne aisa karne se manaa kiya
 There is an image in my industry
 main koi tees maar khan to nahin lekin maine ajtak sirf apane clanit jo ki gunhegaar nahin he use bachaane kii koshish kii he
 Even in Rahul's case, i would bring out everything that was true but many things were being hidden from me and then i heard the voice of my conscience and decided to get out of this case
 rahul raaj kya vaaki tanaav main hai yaa
 
 
 
 jab niraj se poocha gaya ki kya vaaki rahul raaj kii tabiyat nasaaj he yaa phir sirf giraftaar se bachane ke liye vah beemaari kaa sahaara le rahe hai? unhone kaha, 'ham doctoron kii report ko galat nahin tehra sakate
 Yes, what they will say about their stress is that the tension can be of two types, either the shock of Pratyusha's death or the fear of arrest
 main sachai saamne laakar rahoonganiraj ne yah bhi kaha ki vah jald hi is cese se judi sachai logon ke saamne lekar aaenge taaki police ko is cese kii jaanch-padtaal main madad mil sake
 He said, 'I do not want any innocent to be punished but if Rahul is an accused then he should be punished
 agar nahin hai to unhen bachaaya janaa chahie
 i will help the police to solve this case

 janvari 2017 main sanjay lila bhansaali kii film 'padmavat' kaa jamkar virodh karne vaali shri rajput karani sena ke ek dhade ne daawa kiya he ki vah bhagwaan ram ke bade putr lav ke vanshaj hai
 Earlier, former Jaipur princess Diya Kumari claimed that she is a descendant of Kush
 supreme court main ayodhya jameen vivaad maamle kii sunwaayee chal rahi he, lekin in dinon rajasthan ke rajputon main ek bahes chhid gai he ki bhagwaan ram ke asli vanshaj koun hai
 Jumping into the controversy, the Shri Rajput Karni Sena claimed to have an association with Lord Rama
 ajtak se baatcheet main shri rajput karani sena ke sanyojak lokentre singh kaalvi ne daawa kiya ki vah bhagwaan ram ke bade putr lav ke vanshaj hai
 He is a Sisodia Rajput who is considered a descendant of Love
 supreme court ke sawaal se shuru hua vivadais vivaad kii shuruyaat us samay hui jab pichley hafte 9 agast ko ayodhya main ram mandir babari masjid vivaad kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne poocha tha ki kya ram kaa koi vanshaj he, jawaab main ram janm bhoomi kii ore se vakil ne kaha tha ki unhen isaki jaankaree nahin he, lekin jaipur rajgaraane kii vanshaj or purv rajkumaari diya singh ne daawa kiya ki jaipur kaa rajgharaana bhagwaan shri ram ke bete kush kaa vanshaj he or iskaa dastavej jaipur rajgaraane ke paas maujuud he
 Claiming that Ram was a lord, Lokendra Kalvi also said that he would like to be a part of the ongoing dispute in the Supreme Court, should the entire dispute be settled at the earliest
 kai or gharaanon kaa daawaalokentre kaalvi ne jaipur kii purv rajkumaari diya kumari kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki vah kush kii vanshaj hai or ham lav ke vanshaj hai
 However, he tried to make it clear that this debate is not about the descendants of Ram but the land of Ayodhya
 rajasthan ke rajsamand se bijepi saansad diya kumari ne pichley dinon daawa kiya ki vah shri ram kii vanshaj hai or shriram ke bete kush se unka rajawada niklaa he
 After his claim, the Mewar royalty of Rajasthan also claimed to be descendants of Lord Shri Ram
 diya kumari ne ek patrawali ke jariye iske saboot bhi pesh kiye jis par ayodhya ke raja shri ram ke vansh ke sabhi purvajon kaa kramvaar naam likhaa hua he
 In this, the name of Sawai Jai Singh as 209th descendants and Maharaja Bhawani Singh as 307th descendants is written
 mewar rajgaraane ke mahendra singh mewar ne bhi daawa kiya ki mewar rajpariwaar bhagwaan ram ke putr lav kaa vanshaj he
 Former Mewar prince Lakshiraj Singh Mewar had claimed that Colonel James Tod had mentioned in his book 'annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan' that Sri Ram's capital was Ayodhya and that his son Love settled Love Kot i
e
 Lahore
 jabaki lav ke vanshaj baad main gujarat se hote hue aahaar yani mewar main aakar bas gaye jahaan sisodiya rajya kii sthapana hui
 Former prince Laksharaj Singh Mewar said in his claim that the sun symbol of Mewar is the sun
 shriram bhi shiv ke upaask the or mewar parivaar bhi bhagwaan shiv kaa upaask he
 This Mewar testifies to the claim of being descendants of Shriram today
 congress pravaktaa kaa bhi daawaaraam ke vanshaj hone ke daawey par rajasthan main chal rahe vivaad par congress pravaktaa satyendra singh raghav ne bhi bhagwaan ram ke vanshaj hone par apni daavedaari thok di
 Satyendra Singh Raghav claimed that Luv and Kush were the twin sons of ram-sita
 kush ko dakshin kaushal yani chhattisgarh main or lav kaa uttar kaushal main abhishek kiya gaya tha
 He also referred to the page number 1671 of Valmiki Ramayana to confirm this
 congress pravaktaa satyendra singh raghav ne apane daawey kii pushti ke liye kaha ki kalidas kii kaaljayi rachana raghuvansh ke anusaar ram ne apane putr lav ko sharavati kaa or kush ko kushavathi kaa raja banaaya tha
