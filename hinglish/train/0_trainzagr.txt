 ' china ne america se maanavadhikaar masalon ke bahaane uske aantarik maamalon main dakhal na dene ko kaha he
 China has issued this statement on the US comment after the report on human rights
 chini videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa hong lee ne shanivaar ko kaha, "china or america ke bich maanavadhikaar ke masalon ko lekar matbhed hai jisapar ham samanta or paraspar sammaan ke aadhaar par baatcheet karne ke liye icchhuk hai
 "he said," but we are strongly against interference in internal affairs on the pretext of human rights issues
 " lee ne kaha ki china swatantraaa or adhikaron kaa behad sammaan karata he
 Significantly, this is China's response after the US State Department's report on human rights situation around the world on Friday
 china ke videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki america ko 'upadeshak' banane ke bajaay apane yahaan maanavadhikaron kii sthiti ko dekhnaa chahie
 He said, "america should stop interfering in the internal affairs of our country regarding the human rights report
 " Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has included all six BSP mlas in his party
 ab tak congress sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan de rahe in vidhayakon ne vidhansabhadhyaksh si
 P
 joshi kaa anumodan paane ke baad somvaar raat apane vidhanmandal dal ke congress main vilay kii ghoshnaa kii
 Revolt against Mayawati in Rajasthan is not new
 2009 main bhi maujuuda basapa vidhayakon ke netaa rajendra gudda ke hi netritv main basapa vidhayakon ne gahalot kaa haath thama tha
 a few days ago Gudda said in a seminar that he and his colleagues had to buy assembly tickets
 dalon kaa yah vilay dilli main gahalot or unke naayab tathaa pradesh congress cameti adhyaksh sachin payalat kii sonia gandhi se mulaakaat ke turant baad hua
 Gehlot had apprised Sonia Gandhi of his plans to ensure that his government in Rajasthan would run for five years comfortably and not to give the BJP any chance of trying to topple the government like Madhya Pradesh
 is vilay ke baad 200 siton vaali rajasthan vidhansabha main congress sadasyon kii sankchaya 100 se badhkar 106 ho gai he jabaki nirdaliyon or anya ko milakar sarkaar ke paas 120 sadasyon kaa samarthan he
 This is disappointing for the BJP, which has a total of 73 mlas
 uske navaniyukt pradesh adhyaksh satish punia jamini kaaryakarta hai, jo akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad or uske baad yuva morcha se hokar yahaan tak pahunche hai
 Poonia, who represents the powerful Jat community, has more respect and support among party workers, but it is unlikely that they will open a front against the chief minister
 basapa vidhayakon kaa apane dal main vilay karakar sarkaar ko zyada surakshit karne ke gahalot ke kadam ke peeche bada kaaran yah bhi he ki centre ne haal hi main varisht bhaajapa netaa calraj mishra ko rajasthan kaa rajyapal banaakar bheja he
 This move has strengthened Gehlot's position in the internal politics of his party as compared to Pilot
 payalat ke virdohi chaahate hai ki agle ek saal ke dauraan hone ja rahe sthaneey nikaay, panchayat raaj or do vidhansabha kshetron main up chunaav ke pehle ve do main se ek pad choden
 Meanwhile, Pilot has tried to show his influence by organizing two grand events on the death anniversary of his father Rajesh Pilot last June, then on his birthday on 7 September
 agar payalat pradesh congress cameti adhyaksh pad chhodte hai to ve sarkaar main vitt or grih jaise mahatvapurn vibhaagon ke liye saudebaaji kar sakate hai
 These departments are currently held by Chief Minister Gehlot while Pilot has Public Works Department and Panchayati Raj Department
 samajha jaataa he ki sonia gandhi ke saath baithkon ke dauraan payalat ne kanoon or vyavastha ke morche par gahalot kii vifaltaa or naukarshahi main pherbadal tathaa rajnatik niyuktiyon jaise maamalon main bharose main na liye jane kii shikaayat kii he
 On the other hand, Gehlot has reportedly informed Sonia that Pilot does not give enough time to the party and its departments and is behaving like Navjot Singh Sidhu of Punjab
 mukhyamantri kii nigaah ab aagaamee chunaavon par he or ve bhrasht tathaa aksham logon ke khilaaf sakhti baratane vaale prashaasak ke rup main bhi dikhnaa chaahate hai
 Additionally, on the advice of social activists Aruna Roy and Nikhil Dey, they have created a public information portal which provides most of the information sought under the RTI Act online
 agle saal tak ve saarvajanik javabdehi or swasthya ke adhikaar par nayaa kanoon laane par vichaar kar rahe hai
 This will fulfill the promises made to the agitators
 honor kiling or mob linching par ve pehle hi kanoon paarit karvaa chuke hai, jin par centre kii manjuuri kaa intjaar he
 While doing all this, he has to take care of the damage caused by the pilots whose shadow falls on the achievements of the government
 basapa ke sabhi vidhayakon ke congress main aane se sadan main party kii sadsy sankhya 106 ho gai he— rohit parihaar Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta has demanded the Delhi government to release the amount without any delay, after the High Court ordered the Delhi government to release the amount to the East and North mcds
 vijender gupta ne somvaar ko mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se maang karte hue kaha ki wo mananiyahaicourtke adeshon kaa paalan karte hue emsidi ko jald se jald chauthe dilli vittiya ayog ke anuroop dey raashi jari kare
 Gupta said that the order of the Delhi High Court is a big victory for the MCD
 in faisle se north or east emsidi ke 45,000 se bhi adhik karmchaariyon ko raahat milegi kyonki unhen ek maheene ke andar march tak kaa vetan mil jayega or iske saath hi fund kii kami jhel rahi emsidi ko court ke aadesh ke anusaar vakaaya fund milane se vikaas kaaryon ko bhi puraa kiya ja sakegaa
 Gupta said that it is a shame for the Delhi government that it did not show any interest in implementing the recommendations of the Fourth Delhi Financial Commission in the House and outside the House
 yahaan tak ki pareshaan emsidi karmchaariyon kii kejariwal sarkaar ne ek nahin suni or aakhirkaar unhen court se nyaay mila
 He said that the opposition had been demanding from Delhi government for a long time that the dues should be released to the MCD as per the recommendations of the Fourth Financial Commission, but the Delhi government was not providing the dues to the MCD by showing politics and insensitivity
 
 vijedar gupta ne aarope lagaaya ki dilli sarkaar ne paanchaven dilli vittiya ayog kii siforeeshon ko bhi lataka kar rakhaa he
 He warned that if the government did not approve the Fifth Financial Commission on the floor of the House soon, they would soon go to court to implement the recommendations of the Fifth Financial Commission because the economic crisis in the MCD is so severe that its employees from December Could not pay salary to iske kaaran nigamon main karyrat hajaaron safai karmchaaree, adhyaaapak, aspataal ke doctor va karmchaaree, dainik vetanbhogi karmchaariyon sahit pensionadhariyon ko bhi apni rosemara kii jaruratein puri karne main pareshaani aa rahi he
 They have to borrow from relatives and friends to meet basic needs like paying children's fees, rationing the house, milk, vegetables

 Russell had scored an unbeaten 48 from 13 balls in the last match against RCB and KKR had won by chasing a target of 206 runs

 pakistan ko chahie 30 sawaalon ke jawaab
 Pakistan wants india-pakistan bilateral talks to begin soon
 pakistan kii ye do maange ab sirf maange nahin rah gai balki rat ban gai he or isi par bharat ko aa rahi he khiz
 The Foreign Minister, the Home Minister and the Foreign Secretary are in the minds of everyone, what is the question of Pakistan? bharat kaa har roj kahana he ki vakt aane par pakistan ke tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab die jaaenge
 The Foreign Minister has said many times that the Pakistani inquiry report on the Mumbai attack is being studied and answers to these questions will be sent to Pakistan as soon as they are completed but Pakistan is not ready to leave the rut
 pakistan ke videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa abdul basit ne ab kaha he ki 30 dinon ke bheetar chahie sawaalon ke jawaab
 The argument is that it would be difficult to keep the detained accused in remand for more than 30 days
 is rat par bhala gussa nahin aayega to kya hoga
 So Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee was also annoyed
 udhar colombon main saarc baithak main videsh sachiv shivashankar menon ne bhi pakistan ke videsh sachiv salmaan bashir ke dwipaksheeya vaarta shuru karne ke prastaav ko thukraa diya
 The Foreign Secretary bluntly said that bilateral talks are not possible until India sees that there has been an attempt to end the nursery of terror in Pakistan
 vaise pakistan itnaa naasamajh nahin ki bharat kii talkhi kii bhashaa naa samaj sake phir bhi dwipaksheeya vaarta auki sawaalon ke jawaab ko lekar pakistan kii rat khatm nahin ho rahi
 Perhaps Pakistan is looking for an excuse for laxity in the Mumbai attack investigation in the name of delay

The journey so far had been fabulous as we continued to stretch our own limits and bring to stage one after another never seen before acts
 But, little did i know that the world is going to turn upside down for me
 We take the smallest things for granted and really don't know what tomorrow holds for us

 21veen sadi kaa sabase lanbaa purna chandragrahan (longest total lunar eclipse) shuukravaar kii raat ko puraa hua
 The world watched the moon change its color for a few hours
 safed rang ke chand ne dhire-dhire rang badla or ek samay aisa bhi aayaa jab vah surkh laal rang apana chukaa tha
 See in this picture how the moon completely changed its color in a few hours
 aapako bataa den ki bharat main shuukravaar der raat kareeb 11 bajkar 54 minute par chandragrahan shuru hua
 It was a partial lunar eclipse in the first one hour but later it took the form of a full lunar eclipse
 is dauraan desh or duniya main log is adbhut najaare ke sakshi banane ke liye aasmaan main takataki lagaae hue dekhte rahe
 However, due to bad weather in delhi-ncr, the moon was not visible in many places
 ise padhein
 
 
 After the end of the lunar eclipse, do these 10 people all over the world to see the Chandra grahan
 kai deshon main ise dekhne ke liye kaaphi intjaam bhi kiye gaye the
 For the world, even though this phenomenon is related to a process of the universe, in India it was seen as a matter of faith
 duniya bhar main chandragrahan kaa nazaaraa kuch is prakaar dikhaa
 Why is there a lunar eclipse? The simple answer to this is that the arrival of the moon in the earth's shadow
 us sthiti main surya ek taraf, chandramaa duusari taraf or prithvi bich main hoti he
 a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon comes out of the Earth's shadow
 ye padhein
 
 
 During the lunar eclipse, see how the moon appeared in the 10 cities of the country, see the lunar eclipse falls only on the full moon day, but not every full moon has a lunar eclipse
 iskaa kaaran he ki prithvi kii kaksha par chandramaa kii kaksha kaa jhuke hona
 This inclination is about 5 degrees so each time the moon does not enter the Earth's shadow
 uske upar yaa neeche se nikal jaataa he
 The same is true for solar eclipse
 suryagrahan hameshaa amavasya ke din hote hai kyonki chandramaa kaa aakaar prithvi ke aakaar ke mukaable lagbhag 4 guna kam he
 Its shadow is of small size on the earth, so in the state of perfection, solar eclipse can be seen only from a small part of the earth
 lekin chandra grahan kii sthiti main dharti kii chaaya chandramaa ke mukaable kaaphi badi hoti he
 So it takes more time for the moon to pass through it

 Narendra Modi 2
 0 sarkaar ne jis prachand bahumat se satta main vaapasi kii he, usamen kisaanon kii badi bhoomika he
 With an expectation, the country's donors supported the BJP in the election
 sarkaar bhi kisaanon kii samasyaon ko lekar sakriy dikh rahi he
 Although in the last term itself, the Modi government has taken many big steps towards farmers, but has the condition of farmers improved since the Modi government came to power in 2014? Aaj tak-karvy Insights has got this information from the mood survey of the country
 kisaanon kii sehatakitnesudhri?ajtak ne karvi incits ke saath milakar desh kaa mizaaj jane ke liye ek survey kiya
 In the survey conducted in the month of August, 50 percent of the people said that the condition of farmers in the Modi government has improved, whereas in the January survey before the election this year, only 20 percent of the people believed that the health of the farmers was improved
 yani pichley 6 maheenon se kisaanon kii samasyaon ko lekar sarkaar ne jo kadam uthaae hai uskaa asar ab survey main dikh rahaa he
 Rapidly changed in 6 months In this survey, 17 percent of the people said that the condition of farmers in the Modi government is the same, that is, there is no improvement, while in the January-2019 survey, the number of unhappy people was 43 percent
 yani teji se pichley 6 maheenon se kisaanon kii samasya ko lekar logon kaa najariya badla he
 Even now, 28 percent people in Nakhusharsa clearly said that the situation of the farmers has worsened
 yani ye log modi sarkaar ke uthaae kadam ko naakaafi maan rahe hai, jabaki janvari-2019 main 34 fisadi log maanate the ki kisaanon kii sthiti or bigadi he
 Apart from this, 5 percent of the people surveyed did not react to this issue
 darasal, ajtak ke taaja survey main kisaanon ke morche par modi sarkaar ko raahat milti dikh rahi he
 In a way, compared to January-2019, in August-2019, people have increased confidence in the government about the problem of farmers
 19 rajyon main kisaanon kii samasya par sarveajatak or karvi incits ne is survey ke liye 12,126 logon se saakshaatkaar kiya, jisamen 67 fisadi saakshaatkaar gramin or 33 fisadi shahari log shaamil the
 The survey covered 97 parliamentary constituencies and 194 assembly constituencies in 19 states of the country
 uttar pradesh, andhra pradesh, chhattisgarh, haryana, jharkhand, karnataka, kerala, odisha, punjab, rajasthan, tamilnadu, telugana, assam, madhya pradesh, bihar, gujarat, maharashtra, rajdhani dilli or pashchim bengal main yah survey karaayaa gaya
 The survey was conducted before the abolition of special state status under Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 desh kii rajdhani dilli ke ek kudaghar main yuvak kii adhajali laash milane se ilaake main sansani fail gai
 There is a suspicion that this act has been carried out to erase the identity of the dead body after the murder
 yah vaardaat bahari dilli ke mongolpuri ilaake kii he, philhal shav ko kabje main lekar police jaanch main jute gai he
 According to the information, there was a sensation near a litter in Mangolpur Khurd in Mangolpuri area of outer Delhi on Wednesday morning when someone who threw garbage there informed the police after seeing the corpses lying in the dirt
 soochna milane ke baad maukey par pahunchi mongolpuri thana police or aaladhikariyon kii team jaanch main jute gai he
 The body was shown to nearby people for identification
 lekin, shav jalane kii vajah se puri tarah se kshatigrast ho chukaa tha, use pahchaanana bahut hi mushkil tha
 Since the dead body has been found there is a mood of people around
 jalane ke kaaran shav kii haalat kaaphi kharaab ho chuki he jisaki vajah se uski pahchaan nahin ho pai he
 Mangolpuri police station is also trying to find out from the police of nearby police stations to ascertain the identity of the dead body
 mongolpuri ke jis ilaake main ye adhajali laash mili he vahaan par kai choti-choti factoriyaan hai
 However, the police station, which reached the spot, has been taken into possession and sent to the nearby Sanjay Gandhi Hospital for post-mortem
 iske saath hi maamla darj kar aage kii tafteesh main jute gai he

 shridharan ke vichaar kaa swaagat karte hai
 Such views should come in a democracy
 shridharan ji kii chintaa he ki mahilaon ke muft yatra karne se metro aksham hogi or usko nuksaan hoga
 i want to tell E
 Sreedharan ji that the Delhi Metro will not lose even one rupee
 jitna kiraaya mahilaon kaa lagata he, dilli sarkaar utana paisa metro ko degi
 His second concern is that the government should give direct money to the women who travel free inside the metro
 iske andar bahut sari practical samasyaayein hai jaise ki sarkaar yah kaise pataa lagaaegi ki koun mahila kahaan tak safar karegi
 How many days will travel metro se safar karengi yaa bas se safar karegi or unka kitna paisa kharchaa hoga
 Saurabh Bhardwaj said that it is very difficult to ensure that the women we are paying to travel are not for ration or any other household chores
 kyonki sarkaar kisi ko paise kii madad karne ke liye yah yojana nahin chalaa rahi
 The government has many other schemes to help with money
 jaise-pension yojana, vidhwaa pension yojana divorce le chuki mahilaon ke liye yojana, varisht nagarikon ke liye pension kii yojana
 The purpose of this scheme is not to give money
 It aims to increase the participation of women in public space in public transport

 There will be no discussion on inclusion in
 unhone kaha, ‘isliye bharat ko shaamil kiye jane par koi charchaa nahin hogi'

 Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was made Prime Minister, resigned from the post on Saturday after the controversial move by President Maithripala Sirisena to end the power struggle in Sri Lanka
 ranil vikramsinghe ravivaar ko desh ke pradhanmantri pad kii shapath le sakate hai
 In fact, due to two important decisions of the Supreme Court, it was impossible for Rajapaksa to continue in this post, after which he resigned
 rajpakshe samarthak saansad shehan semasinghe ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki rajpakshe ne colombo main apane awaas par hue ek kaarykram main tyaagptr par hastakshar kar die
 The MP said, 'rajapaksa told the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) mps that he has resigned from the post
 ' ucchtam nyaayalay ne brihaspativaar ko sarvasammati se faisla diya ki sirisena dwaara sansad bhang karnaa 'gaiyrkanoonee' tha
 At the same time, the court on Friday refused to stay the order of the court restraining Rajapaksa (73) from taking over as Prime Minister

 He claimed that Rajapaksa could hold office without resigning but that would increase political uncertainty in the country, so the former president has decided to resign following a court order

 pichley saal jab ham mili the tabase hughali main kaaphi pani bah chukaa he
 Especially October has been a very special month for the people of India and Kolkata - Abhijeet Banerjee is one of the few Indians who have received the Nobel Prize, and i would also like to say that he is one of the three Bengalis to receive this award
 isi maheene main bhartiya cricket ke dada saurav ganguli bisisiai ke 39wein president bane hai
 West Bengal is going through an interesting phase of history today
 jaisaa ki maine gaur kiya india today ke pichley maheene hue stats of da stats survey main pashchim bengal kaa sthaan neeche rahaa he, pichley varshon ke kharaab pradarshan kii vajah se, desh ke 20 behtareen pradarshan vaale rajyon main uskaa sthaan 12waan he
 But it has improved the most in 10 categories - overall development, economy, governance, law and order, entrepreneurship, cleanliness, health, education and agriculture
 isamen bengal ne sirf ek saal main 13wein sthaan se 8wein sthaan tak chalaang lagaai he, jo yah dikhaata he ki teji se badlaav asambhav nahin he
 According to the government data released in August this month, West Bengal has the highest 12 among 20 states and union territories in the year 2018-19
 58 fisadi kaa jiesdipi growth rate hasil kiya he
 When Bengal moves forward, the whole region moves forward and i sincerely hope that Bengal will regain the dominant status it has held over the last century - the gateway and engine of growth for 11 neighboring states

 8 percent

 Three widespread conflicts are emerging in this area
 pehla, nishchit rup se raajnneetik ladaai he
 In the Lok Sabha elections to be held in May this year, we saw the bjp's first rise in West Bengal
 party is rajya main 2014 ke 2 siton se 2019 main 18 siton tak pahunch gai he or 40 fisadi vot hasil kiye hai
 However, in the by-election held last week, we saw that TMC won all the three assembly seats
 inamen se usne 2 siten bijepi se chhini hai
 This probably means that bjp's rise in West Bengal is not so easy
 saal 2021 ke vidhansabha chunaav 18 maheene baad hi hai, or isi vajah se sabaki is par nazren hai
 Will it be 'ram vs Durga'? We have kept a session on this with people from all political parties who will give you more information

 The second is confrontation, integration versus inclusion
 lambey samay tak purvottar ek tarah se bharat ke haashie par rahaa he
 The infrastructure developed very little and this area remained largely neglected in the same way as it was in the colonial period
 jaisi ki ummid thi, ab yah badal rahaa he
 We have seen that the expenditure on infrastructure development in the Northeast has increased to Rs 50,000 crore - almost all the railroads in the Northeast have been converted into broad gauge
 darjanon nae railmargon par kaam ho rahaa he taaki purvottar ke sabhi rajyon kii rajdhaniyon ko rail sampark se joda ja sake

 teesraa or sabase chintajanak takaraav jo ubharate main dekh rahaa hum, vah phir se purab se he, ki kis tarah se pahchaan kaa sankat hamaare saamne khadaa ho rahaa he
 Migration has been a sensitive subject for the Northeast and has kept Assam warm for nearly four decades
 is saal hamane yah dekha ki assam main neshnal register of citigen jari kiya gaya
 It is perhaps the largest citizenship certification exercise of its kind in the world
 yah asal main avaidh pravaasiyon kii pahchaan kaa aadhaar banane ke liye tha
 So far, about 19 lakh so-called outsiders have been left out of its final list
 abhi isaki niyati ko lekar anischitata jari hi he ki enarasi ko puure desh main lagu karne kii baat shuru ho gai he
 a strange solution which could have been confined only to Assam, will now be implemented across the country
 ham jaldi hi yah dekh sakate hai ki karodon bharatiyon ko apni naagarikta sabit karne ke liye kaha ja rahaa he
 Those who do not have it will be treated as foreigners and as our Home Minister Amit Shah has said, they will be thrown out before 2024
 ham pahchaan kii raajnneeti kaa raajnneetikaran hote dekh rahe hai or sambhavat: yah sattarudh dal ke liye ek pramukh chunavi masalaa ban jaae
 Will citizenship in 2024 be the same as the Ram temple in the 1990s? It will be known soon
 aaj yahaan kai aise satr honge jinamein purvottar main ‘avaidh astitv’, pahchaan kii raajnneeti or purvottar se bahriyon ko dur rakhane ke upaay karne kii chunautiyon ke bare main manthan hoga
 But there is much more than politics
 ham agle do dinon main sangharsh or vijay kii kuch saadhaaran kahaniyon se rubaru honge
 In front of us will be Sourav Ganguly, the grandfather of Indian cricket, who will explain what it is like to be the president of the world's richest cricket institution
 hamaare aise hi ek sabase rochak satr main teen asaadhaaran mahilaayein bhagidaari kar rahi hai
 a director whose film is the first official entry to be nominated for an Oscar this year, a national-level 400-meter record-winning athlete who won five gold medals in 20 days and a doctor who became an actor in an unusual Assamese film, Year created global recognition
 aap sabakaa ek baar phir swaagat he

 aajkal railway lagaataar apane niyamon main badlaav kar rahaa he
 The new change may be with Aadhaar card sutron ke mutabik railway tikaton kii booking ke liye aadhaar card ko anivaary karne kii disha main kaam kar rahi he
 If this happens, while filling the form for the ticket, now you have to provide your Aadhaar number along with information like age, gender
 is niyam ko railway do charnon main lagu karne kii yojana par kaam kar rahi he
 Aadhaar will be mandatory for special discounted tickets in the first phase
 jaise kii senior sitijan, viklang cote jaisi tikaton par
 Railway argues that by doing this, it will be easier to do things like knowing the address and paying the insurance amount in case of an accident
 aane vaale vaqt main milane vaali chhot kii rakam ko bhi aadhaar card se joda ja saktaa he
 Whereas in the second phase, there is a plan to implement Aadhaar mandatory with all tickets
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki abhi 90 fisidi se adhik logon ke paas aadhaar card he or baaki bache logon tak bhi jald pahunchane kii koshish sarkaar kii taraf se ho rahi he
 The comments railway kaa maananaa he ki aadhaar ke saath jodne se railway ko kai phaayde honge, masalan tikaton kii kalabazari par lagaam lagegi, haadase kii sthiti main pahchaan main aasaani hogi, beemaa kii raashi sahi haathon main pahonchegi or bankig len-dein main vaqt bachegaa
 Railway is considering to alternate the base
 takneekee pahalu irctc ne puraa kar liya he, ab board ko tay karnaa he
 It is being said that it is very possible for senior citizens to be made mandatory
 is par vichaar kii sabase badi vajah beemaa yojana kaa launch hona he
 If there is a link to Aadhaar, it will be easy to get the victim's address in case of any extent doosraa niyamit yatra karne waalon ke liye maheene main 6 baar tikat kii bandish khatm karne par bhi vichaar ho rahaa he
 Thirdly, if Aadhaar will be linked to a system like rupay Card, then there will be time left in banking transactions and there will be more scope for confirmed tickets
 lekin abhi koi policy nahin bani he
 Railways are working on a plan to implement this rule in two phases
 pehle charan main vishesh chhot vaali tikaton ke liye aadhaar kaa hona anivaary hoga
 On tickets like senior seats, handicapped quota
 railway kii daleel he ki aisa karne se haadase kii sthiti main adress jaanane, beemaa kii rakam adaa karne jaise kaamon main aasaani hogi
 The amount of rebate available in the coming time can also be linked to the Aadhaar card
 jabaki duusare charan main aadhaar kii anivaaryta ko sabhi tikaton ke saath lagu karne kii yojana he
 The government believes that more than 90 percent people have an Aadhaar card and the government is trying to reach the remaining people soon
 tippaniyan Railways believe that linking with Aadhaar will bring many benefits to the railways, such as the sale of tickets will curb, ease of detection in the event of an accident, the amount of insurance will reach the right hands and time will be left in banking transactions
 railway aadhaar ko vaikalpik karne par vichaar kar rahi he
 The technical aspect irctc has completed, now the board has to decide
 kaha ja rahaa he ki senior sitijan ke liye bahut mumkin he ki anivaary kar diya jaay
 The biggest reason for considering this is the launch of the insurance scheme
 agar aadhaar se link hoga to koi hadasa hone kii sthiti main peedit kaa pataa milane main aasaani hogi
 The second regular trip is being considered to end the 6-month ticket restriction
 teesraa, aadhaar ko roope card jaisi vyavastha se jod diya jayega to banking tranjection main vakt bachegaa or conform tikat kii gunjaaish zyada hogi
 But no policy has been made yet
 aane vaale vaqt main milane vaali chhot kii rakam ko bhi aadhaar card se joda ja saktaa he

 akhabaaron ke vigyaapan kya kehete hai? pehle panne par ek bada-sa artical in vigyapanon ke modern hone kaa daawa kar rahaa he
 In these, words like Modern, Educated, Cultured, Intellectual are also used
 modernity ke in daavon se abhibhoot aap aage badhate hai
 Strolling through the headlines of Brahmin, Thakur, Agrawal, Punjabi, Baniya, Bhumihar, the eyes stop at a heading while looking through the advertisements
 bade-bade aksharon main likhaa he-cosmopolitan / no cast baar (jati bandhan nahin)
 Let us examine some advertisements: * Jat Sikh beautiful, well-behaved girl, 27, 5
 7 feet, emessi (computer science), cast no baar, (essi-asti excuj)
 * Suitable Match for Brahmin Boy, 32, 5
 9 feet, government teacher, cast no baar, (essi, asti, obisi excuj
 ) Let's give them excuses, because they are not confusing
 ab is vigyaapan par najar daaliye :*profeshnal, sie, 31, 5
 9 feet, looking for a beautiful, professional girl
 cast no baar
 Regardless of the caste, in this category of Cast No Bar, you call on this advertisement with the relation of a girl, then it is known that the boy is a Kanyakubj Brahmin
 ladki padhi-likhi he, khubasurat he, bank main naukari karti he
 All these things fit perfectly in the frame of need, but at one point the frame gets chopped off
 ''ladki dalit he
 "after a few seconds of silence on the other side of the phone, a voice is heard," Oh, never mind, but we don't get married in SC
 ''kuch din pehle chitrakoot kaa rahane vaala ek vyakti vivek tiwari shaadi ke teen saal baad or haal hi main ek bachche ke janm ke baavjood apni patni kii hatya kar detaa he
 The reason? The wife whom he had understood to be Pooja Mishra till now, was of a backward caste
 vah brahman nahin he, yah jaananaa tiwari ke liye jabardast sadma tha
 There are castes in the society, and there is also caste discrimination, this thing is clear in broad daylight
 phir cast no baar kaa tag lagaakar shahari aadhunik madhyavarg kise bevakoof bana rahaa he?internet par 'cast no baar-essi / asti excuj' likhane par atharah lakh pej khulte hai or 'obisi excuj' likhane par chauvan hajaar
 But of these too, the number of racist advertisements claiming 'no caste bond' is the highest
 ye chipa hua cheharaa he
 India Today contacted 100 of the advertisements for Cosmopolitan and Cast No Bar in the last three months in two leading English newspapers, 52 of which were Brahmins (bengali, Tamil, Kanyakubj, all), 24 Kshatriyas, 11 Rajputs, six Aroras
 , Four were Yadavs and three were Agarwals
 haalanki sabhi vigyapanon main ladke kii oonchi naukari or ladki ke khubasurat rang-rup kaa daawa tha, lekin usase zyada buland aawaaj main ve kah rahe the-cast no baar
 Undoubtedly, these advertisements assure that in a small urban and educated section, caste walls are crumbling
 150 vigyapanon main 15 hi sahi, lekin aise log to hai, jinhen is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki naam ke aage mishra yaa jha likhaa he, maury yaa vishwakarma
 But you cannot stay long in this happy dream of 'society is changing' because as soon as we start investigating the claims of these advertisements, another face of truth comes out
 cast no baar kaa pehla hi vigyaapan five disit selary vaale ek software profeshnal ke liye kisi bhi jati kii padhi-likhi or varking ladki kii demand kar rahaa he
 When you call a girl's relation with them, it is known that the boy is a Brahmin
 phone par rishte ke liye kaaphi baaten hoti hai, lekin yah baatcheet tabhi tak sahaj rah sakati he, jab tak aap yah khulaasa na kar den ki ladki darasal dalit he
 The modernity of upper caste modern people who advertise cast no bar becomes air as soon as they hear Dalit, Valmiki, Jatav, tanners, potter, carpenter, washerman
 kai tarah kii pratikriyaayein ho sakati hai
 If someone refuses, someone angrily disconnects the phone, then someone mail his details, saying that he keeps the phone
 ab tak aap brahman metrimoni dot com yaa agarwal-bhoomihaar vivaah samaaj ko hi jativaadee maanate aae the, lekin ab hindustan kii ucch jatiyon ke ek chhipe hue jatvaad kaa cheharaa khulne laga he
 It is found that the cast no bar of upper castes is actually confined to the scope of certain upper castes
 brahman, thakur, baniyaa or bahut hua to kysth tak shaadi kii ja sakati he, lekin usase neeche nahin
 Not Dalit, not backward, not tribal at all
 dalit vichaarak kaancha ilaiya kehete hai, ''cast no baar kaa vigyaapan dene vaale adhikanshtah savarna hote hai
 No Dalit claims to have no caste bond because he is at the bottom of the social divide
 khud tathakthith oonche or shreshth hone ke baavjood apni shreshthata ko sweekaar na karne kaa dambh to koi savarna hi dikhaa saktaa he
 "apara Mishra, 25, who is doing research in Political Science from Delhi University, says," My parents tell me and my brother that we can marry any caste of our choice except Dalits and Muslims
 ''cast no baar kii apeksha bhi amuman putr ke vaivaahik vigyaapan main hoti he
 In the case of a girl, this happens only if she is divorced, widowed, has children or has a physical disability
 manovaigyanik sudhir kakkad kehete hai, ''hindustani samaaj pitrusattatmak he, jahaan vansh purush ke naam se chalata he
 Hence it becomes more acceptable for a boy to have interracial marriage than a girl
 ''aaj se kareeb das saal pehle dalit lekhak jaiprakash kardam ne ek kahani likhi thi, jiskaa sheershak cast no baar hi tha
 The protagonist of the story goes to meet the girl's house after seeing the advertisement of 'cast No Bar' in the matrimonial advertisement
 sukhad paariwarik maahaul main ho rahi baatcheet us vakt ek katu mode par aakar khatm ho jaati he, jab ladki waalon ko pataa chalata he ki ladkaa dalit he
 They forgot to add a word to the ad with Cast No Bar — Cast No Bar Within the Castes of the upper caste
 madhya pradesh ke hoshangabad ke gaanv shobhapur ke prashanth dube jati se becoward katni kii roli shivahare se vivaah karnaa chaahate the
 It was a big challenge for these two social workers who work for awareness among tribals and farmers to fight the stereotypes of their own family
 prashanth ko sirf usee ladki se vivaah kii ijaajat thi, jo jati se brahman ho
 Prashant's stubbornness finally paid off, but after five years of long waiting and conflicts

 Suryanarayan Singh suddenly became the laughingstock of the city's Thakurs and upper caste people when he decided to marry a backward woman

 Then i used to think that he does not consider caste bond

 He could never get out of his sense of greatness that despite being of upper caste, he married a dalit girl
 ''yatharth yahi he ki upar se duniya jitani badali dikhti he utani nahin badali he
 Advertisements for 'cosmopolitan and Cast No Bar' have increased in newspapers, but they do not create anything more than confusion
 ilaiya kehete hai, ''yah cosmopolitan varg us bengali bhadralok kii tarah he, jo hameshaa kuch savarna jatiyon ke bheetar vivaah kar jati-bandhan na maanane ke mahanata-bodh se grast rahata he
 '' bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh samet zyaadaatar netaa gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karaane par amada hai
 But Narendra Modi does not have a majority in the highest policy making body of the party that decides the candidate
 june kii goa kaaryakarini main laalkrishna adwani ke purajor virodh ke baavjood narendra modi ko kendriya chunaav abhiyaan samiti kii kaman saunpi gai thi
 But now he is seen on the surface of the party's opposition to projecting the prime ministerial candidate before the assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi
 haalanki adwani ko manaane kii koshish main party ke tamaam netaa jude hai
 In such a situation, the question arises that will there really be a decision to make Modi the Prime Ministerial candidate in the possible BJP Parliamentary Board meeting on 13th September? There is speculation that Modi will be formally project PM since July but Despite everything being decided, what is the reason for the delay? If sources are to be believed, the way the Sangh is being promoted completely in the case of BJP, Darius He tried a Modi supporter factions of the party in order to put pressure on the rival camp
 lekin nitin gadakari ko duusari baar adhyaksh banavaane ke masale par haath jala chukaa sangh parivaar aisa kuch nahin karnaa chahta ki aakhir main sara thikra uske sir phute
 The Gadkari episode was promoted as a defeat of the Sangh and victory of the Advani camp
 aise main modi ko pradhanmantri ummidavaar ghoshit karaane ke liye party ke saamne ab teen vikalp hi dikhte hai
 Whereas, the Sangh has only two options, either to issue a direct decree to the BJP to declare Modi's name or to leave the decision on the party's parliamentary board
 modi samarthak khemaa or khaas taur se rajnath singh kii koshish he ki is maamle main sangh sidhaa farmaan jari kar de, lekin apni pansad jaahir karne ke baad bhi sangh philhal vito lagane se parhez kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, the pro-bjp faction of the BJP insists on making him the PM candidate, then it is clear that consensus in the Parliamentary Board is not possible without a decree of the Sangh
 agar faisla board par hi choda gaya to philhal kii sthiti main adwani khemaa aam sahmati par raji hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 Now the question is that if Modi's candidature comes to vote in the Parliamentary Board, can he get a majority? The parliamentary board has a total of 12 members including Modi himself
 agar unke naam par voting hui to ve vot nahin kar paaenge, jabaki purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi sakriy nahin he or aswasthta kii vajah se kabhi board kii meeting main shaamil nahin hote
 In this case, a total of 10 members are left
 jinamein se adwani, sushamaa swaraj, murali manohar joshi, nitin gadakari or anant kumaar ke bare main mana jaataa he ki ye modi ke khilaaf vot karenge
 That means 5 out of 10 votes can go against Modi
 ab agar modi samarthakon kii list dekhen to khud adhyaksh rajnath singh, venkaiya naidu, arun jetali or thavarchand gahalot hai
 That means a total of four votes will be in Modi's favor
 ab bachaa ek vot sanghathan mantri raamalaal kaa, jinhen sansadeey board main isliye jagah mili hai kyonki is pad par baithne vaala purnakalik prachaarak hi hota he or unhen bijepi main sangh kaa doot mana jaataa he
 In such a case, their vote will be directly considered as the vote of the union
 lekin vishesh paristhiti main raamalaal ko bhi voting karne diya jaataa he to bhi mukabali barabari par jaakar atak jaataa he
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see what process BJP and Sangh adopt for Modi's candidature
 jammu-kashmir main anuchhed 370 ke tahat mili special states kaa darja khatm kiye jane ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne raashtra ke naam sambodhan main jammu-kashmir or ladakh ke bare main khulkar baat kii
 He said that the dream was of Sardar Patel, of Babasaheb Ambedkar, of Dr
 Syama Prasad Mukherjee, of Atal ji and crores of patriots, that is now fulfilled
 is dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jammu-kashmir or ladakh main paae jane vaale sansadhano ke bare main bhi bataaya
 He called upon the youth of Kashmir to contribute to the development of Kashmir and the country
 piem modi ne ladakh ke ek paudhe kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki yah paudha ek prakaar se sanjivani he
 In the message to the nation, PM Modi has promised to build new Kashmir and new Ladakh, the name of that plant is Rodiola
 ladakh main sthaneey log ise solo ke naam se jaanate hai
 This plant is one such type of herb which is found in cool and elevated environment
 is paudhe ke bare main vaigyanik daawa kar chuke hai ki yah aisi aushadhi ke rup main kaam karata he jo rog pratirodhi tantra ko niyamit karata he or sharir ko parvatiy paristhitiyon ke anuroop dhalane main madad karata he
 This plant also protects from radioactivity
 sthaneey log is paudhe kii pattiyon kaa upyog sabji ke rup main karte hai
 Not only this, it is very useful for soldiers deployed in difficult situations like Siachen
 raashtra ke naam sandesh main PM modi ke wo 10 vaade jo bhavishya kaa kashmir banaaengepm modi ne kaha ki main aahvaan karata hum ki ladakh or jammu-kashmir main pai jane vaali aisi chizon ko desh ke anya bhaagon main pahunchaaen jisase inkaa laabh sabko mil sake
 Apart from this, PM Modi while speaking about the future of elections in Jammu and Kashmir said that we all want assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir in the coming time
 nai sarkaar bane or mukhyamantri bhi bane
 i assure the people of Jammu and Kashmir that you will have the opportunity to choose your representative with a lot of honesty

 dilli hai court ne centre sarkaar kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya
 In the petition, the central government had opposed moving a tax dispute case with telecom company Vodafone to the International Arbitration Tribunal
 bataa den ki donon pakshon ke bich 2012 main pichhali tithi se lagu kiye gaye ek kanoon ke tahat 11,000 karod rupee kii kar maang ko lekar vivaad bana hua he
 Judge Manmohan of the Delhi High Court said that the central government could approach the uk-based Arbitration Tribunal under the indo-uk Bilateral Investment Protection Agreement for its complaints in this matter
 vodaphone ne bharat - britain or bharat - netherland dwipaksheeya nivesh suraksha samjhaute ke tahat is sambandh main madhyasthata prakriya shuru kii he
 Significantly, the case is related to the deal of Vodafone acquiring Hutchison Telecom for $ 11 billion, in which the government of India had demanded tax of Rs 11,000 crore from the company
 bharat - netherland dwipaksheeya nivesh suraksha samjhaute ke tahat madhyasthata prakriya ke lambit rahane ke bich hi company ne 24 janvari 2017 ko bharat - britain dwipaksheeya nivesh suraksha samjhaute ke tahat duusari antarrashtriya madhyasthata prakriya bhi shuru kar di
 The comments iske virodh main centre sarkaar ne adaalat se kaha ki vodaphone samooh ne do madhyasthata prakriya shuru karke kanoon kii prakriya kaa durupyog kiya he
 Challenging the second arbitration process, the government said that two separate tribunals formed under two different investment treaties have sought equal relief against the same nation in a case that is based on similar action
 dilli hai court ke jaj manmohan ne kaha ki is maamle main centre sarkaar apni shikayaton ke liye bharat-britain dwipaksheeya nivesh suraksha samjhaute ke tahat britain sthit madhyasthata adhikaran se sampark kar sakati he

 Before that, the Haryana Police was full of breath in order to physically present Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim in court

 On the appeal of the Haryana government in this whole case, the Special CBI Court of Panchkula gave huge relief to the Haryana Police and the Haryana Government, allowing the Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim to present it through video conferencing
 ab 11 janvari ko gurmeet ram rahim ko video conferencing ke jariye hi special sibiai court main pesh kiya jayega or court kaa faisla sunaaya jayega

 Gurmeet Ram Rahim may be serving a 20-year sentence in rape cases at the Sunaria Jail in Rohtak at present, but he is still facing several cases of impotence and murder of sadhus
 inamen se kai maamle apane antim charan main he
 But the challenge before the Haryana Police is that supporters of Gurmeet Ram Rahim are still present in large numbers
 aise main agar gurmeet ram rahim ko jail se baahar nikaal kar baar-baar court ke saamne pesh kiya jayega to pradesh kii kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti ko sanbhaalanaa haryana police ke liye badi chunauti hogi
 For this reason, the police is trying to present Gurmeet Ram Rahim through video conferencing in all these cases, and the sentence should be announced or pronounced through video conferencing even on the day of pronouncement

 tabhi se sabhi norsen pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari se milakar apni punah vaapasi kii maang kar rahi thim
 Tiwari had assured him that he would talk to the municipal corporation to put him on the job again

 sena main ab mahilayen bhi kaman sambhaal sakengi, lekin yah mauka un mahilaon ko milegaa jo 2015 se sena main kamishan hogi
 Although women have been involved in the army since 1991, but there has always been a reluctance in the army about women
 2008 main court ke faisle ke baad pehle nausena or vayusena main mahilaon ko sthai kamishan diya gaya, lekin thal sena ne badi mushkil se mahilaon ko sthai kamishan diya
 Presently, women have been given permanent commission in Legal, Intelligence, Supply only
 ab 2031 ke kareeb mahilaon ko sthai kamishan aviation, signal jaisi shakhaon main diya jayega
 The condition of women in the three army can be gauged from the fact that there are only 2250 women in the army of 12 lakh, they are also officers, there are 465 women officers in the Navy with 99 thousand and one lakh 40 thousand
 There are only 1100 women officers in the Air Force
 ullekhneey he ki desh ke ardhsainik balon main mahila javaanon kii bhartee bhi hoti he
 Even women in the Border Security Force have been deployed in the security of Indian posts on the international border and are also patrolling along the border
 haa, ab 15 saal baad bhartiya sena main mahila adhikari apni unit cmand kar sakengi
 At the same time, women officers claim that women officers have performed better in competitions on all occasions within the army
 baavjood iske, vahiin, inkaa tark he ki behatar pradarshan ko darkinar karte hue sena ne kabhi mahila adhikariyon ko tavajjo nahin di
 And now that the army has agreed to command, then that too has become possible after the intervention of the court
 vahiin, bhartiya sena main ye sari mahila adhikari sport role main hai, par combet role kaa sawaal hi nahin hota
 This simply means that no female officer can enter the battlefield, whereas a woman in the Navy cannot enter a warship, nor a woman fighter aircraft can fly in the Air Force
 udhar, pakistan jaise kattar mulk main aaj mahila ladaaku vimaan uda rahi hai or haal main pakistan kii vayusena kii flite leftinent aesha faruk ne duniya main pehali mahila fiter payalat kaa gaurav hasil kiya jisane kisi ilaake main bam giraaya he
 a senior army officer told that the situation is different in India, women cannot be suddenly taken up in the army
 uske liye training ke saath maahaul bananaa padegaa, tab jaakar baat ban sakati he
 At the same time, Captain Sumisha Shankar, who has worked in the army for five years, says that give women a chance, you should build a National Defense Academy for women, then see the result
 keval ghoshnaa se nahin hoga, usase pehle thos dhaancha bananaa hoga
 Half of the country's population is female, but do not know why women have not got anything easily
 mahilaon ke adhikaar ladane vaali ek samaajik kaaryakarta ne kaha ki jahaan kahin bhi mahila kaam karti he, us sanghathan main kai achche badlaav bhi aate hai
 Some argue that if women are more involved in the army, then the human face of the army will come to the fore and the incidents like human rights abuses, suicide and depression will be curbed

 In this way, 40 percent of Delhi's pollution comes from the transport sector
 bheedbhad or ghani aabaadi vaale ilaake main pradooshan zyada hoga

 puure ensiaar main yah lagu hoga, kyonki ek jagah kaa pradooshan duusari jagah ja saktaa he
 Delhi-government initiative aud-even can help reduce pollution because the more public transport, the more private vehicles will be and the pollution will be less

 krishi mantri sharad pavaar ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko patr likhakar unase apil kii he ki desh se or adhik maatra main chini kaa niryaat karne kii anumati di jaani chahie
 Sources said on Tuesday that the Agriculture Minister said that sugar is fast in the international market at this time and this is the right time to take advantage of it
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki bharat ke liye phaayde kii yah sthiti ek maheene tak hi rahegi
 In April, the government allowed the export of five lakh tonnes of sugar under the Open General License (OGL)
 chini udyog 15 lakh ton atirikt chini kaa niryaat karnaa chahta he
 According to sources, Pawar has said in a letter to the Prime Minister that domestic China production is more than required and prices are high in the global market
 aise main niryaat badhaana thik rahegaa
 Prices in the world market are Rs 500-600 per tonne higher than India
 kaa adhik premium he
 Emphasizing that the decision to export is taken at the right time, the Agriculture Minister has said that the country has already benefited from sugar exports during january-march 2011 due to the delay in allowing the export of the first five lakh tonnes of sugar
 a good chance to bite is lost
 pavaar ne pradhanmantri se kaha he, 'meraa spasht maananaa he ki hamen is avasar kaa laabh uthaanaa chahie or uplabdh adhishesh chini ko tatkaal niryaat karne kii anumati di jaani chahie
 Late decision making will prove to be an adverse step
 ' pichley saptaah khaadya mantri ke ve thomas ne kaha tha ki diwaali tak koi atirikt niryaat karne kii anumati nahin di jaayegi kyonki tyohaaron ke mausam main chini kii maang achaanak bad jaati he
 Pawar has argued in his letter that the additional sugar exports will reduce the burden of over-stocking of those sugar mills and increase their cash flow so that they will be able to cope with the financial crisis and make payments to the sugarcane farmers
 duniya main chini ke duusare sabase bade utpaadak desh or vishaltam khapatkarta desh bharat main 2010-11 ke satr (aktubar se sitambar) main chini utpaadan 2
 Production is estimated to be 42 million tonnes, which was 1 in the previous season
 88 karod ton tha
 Annual domestic demand of sugar 2
 2 se 2
 250 million tonnes
 pavaar ne aagaah kiya ki 2011-12 kaa satr adhishesh varsh hone kii ummid he
 This can also cause serious problems as there will not be profitable export options in the coming years
 chaalu chini satr ke ant main bharat ke paas 65 lakh ton kaa vishaal stock hoga jo teen maah kii khapat ke maandand se kahin kaaphi adhik hoga
 Among the enthusiasts of the Lok Sabha elections, Rabri Devi, the former Chief Minister of Bihar and wife of Lalu Prasad Yadav, has made a claim about Nitish Kumar, which has increased the political mercury of Bihar

 unhone kaha tha ki main tejasvi ko 2020 main mukhyamantri ke taur par dekhnaa chahta hum or aap mujhe pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar ke taur par elaan kar den
 Even after the separation of JDU from the Grand Alliance, Prashant Kishor visited us five times

 He said that if Kishore refuses to meet former Chief Minister Lalu Prasad with this proposal, then he is lying white

 Expressing displeasure over Kumar's claim that the RJD supremo had been talking to Kishore from the jail, he said that even we (family members) people do not get a chance to talk to him (lalu Prasad) on phone Meet and what about Anant Singh's claim that during his stay in jail, Lalan Singh (minister) used to have a telephone conversation with Nitish
 mafia don se raajnneetijna bane mokama vidhansabha seat kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale anant singh pehle kumaar ke nikat the par 2015 ke chunaav se pehle unke rishte kharaab ho gaye
 Anant Singh made this claim in an interview given to a local news portal
 beete saal sitambar main jad(you) ke purna sadsy bane kishor ne twitor par yah sweekaar kiya ki unhone dal kii sadsyta lene se purv prasad se kai baar mulaakaat kii thi
