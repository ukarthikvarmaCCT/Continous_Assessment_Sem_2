 Social activist Anna Hazare said that the high level judiciary would be kept out of the purview of the Lokpal Bill proposed by the society and the stance of their representatives in the drafting of the Bill would be 'flexible'
 masauda taiyaar karne vaali das sadasyeey samiti kii pehali baithak main bhaag lene ke liye dilli jane kii taiyaari kar rahe hajaare ne kaha ki lokapal ke daayre se ucch nyaayalay or ucchtam nyaayalay ke jajon ko baahar rakhaa janaa chahie
 The committee consists of Anna Hazare, four members nominated by him and five cabinet ministers
 vidheyak par shanivaar ko vitt mantri pranav mukherjee kii adhyakshata main samiti charchaa karegi
 Hazare said that only the lower level judiciary should be kept within the ambit of the Bill
 unhone kaha, ‘samaaj ke pratinidhi vidhi visheshgy hai or unhen lanbaa anubhav he
 As for the flexible approach, it will be evident at the time of discussion
 ’ unase poocha gaya tha ki unke dwaara prastaavit ‘jan lok paal’ ke daayre main kya ucchtam nyaayalay ke jajon ko bhi rakhaa jayega
 Facing criticism for praising Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar, the Chief Ministers of Gujarat and Bihar respectively, Hazare said that he never supported communal or divisive politics
 saamaajik kaaryakarta ne aarope lagaaya ki ‘raajnneetik or aapraadhik takatein’ lokapal vidheyak ke paksh main ho rahe deshvyapee andolan ko badnaam or aalochana kar, ise kamjor karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Hazare said that he has only appreciated the development work done by the governments of Narendra Modi in Gujarat and Nitish Kumar in Bihar
 unhone kaha, ‘meri tippaniyon ko kuch logon ne galat samaj liya
 i have never endorsed any communal politics or partition politics
 ’ unhone raajnneetik or aapraadhik takaton par bhrashtachar ke khilaaf rashtravyapee andolan ko kamjor karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ye takatein jan lokapal vidheyak ko mil rahe aam aadmi ke baari samarthan se chintit ho gai hai
 Hazare said without naming that these forces are trying to create confusion and discredit the movement
 usne poocha gaya ki kuch log unamem gandhi kii jhalak dekhte hai, to kya vah swayan ko doosraa mahatma maanate hai
 On this, Hazare said, 'I am not even equal to the dust of Mahatma's feet
 haa, mere jivan par unka bahut gaharaa prabhaav he
 On the demand for videography of the proceedings of the committee, Hazare said that the government is a public servant and there should be complete transparency in its functioning
 unhone kaha, ‘yadi koi baithak kii videography kaa virodh karata he to iskaa matlab he ki uski antaratma saaf nahin he
 People have the right to know about the process of drafting the bill
 isiilie main kaarywahi kii videography kaa pakshdhar hum
 Hazare was asked that what he and his supporters are doing will in some way violate the responsibilities of mps and Parliament
 is par hajaare ne kaha ki unki bhoomika ko lekar yah ek galatfahami he
 He said, 'mps are public servants
 unhen arth prabandhan or samaaj ke kalyaan ke liye kanoon banane ke liye sansad bheja jaataa he
 The Lokpal Bill could not be passed in the last 42 years
 aath baar naakaami haath lagi
 It is now the right of the people to launch a movement to get it passed
 ’hajaare ne is ashanka ko bhi khaarij kar diya ki samaaj dwaara prastaavit lok paal santhaan ‘aniyantrit takat’ ban jayega
 The Gandhian social worker said, 'lok Pal and other members will be selected by a high level committee with complete transparency
 ’ unhone kaha ki yadi lokapal kaa koi sadsy kisi maamle main doshi paaya jaataa he to use ek maah main hataa diya jayega
 Hazare had said that if the Lokpal Bill is not passed in Parliament by August 15, he will agitate again
 is bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki isamen vilamb nahin hoga kyonki masauda taiyaar karne ke liye 30 june kii samay seemaa tay kii gai he
 On the criticisms made by him on the statements made by political leaders, the social worker said that he never called all politicians of India corrupt
 hajaare ne kaha, ‘sabhi staron par bahut kam apwaad hai
 But those exceptions can be respected only if they raise their voice against the corruption happening near them
 bhrashtachar par chup rahanaa bhi bhrashtachar kaa samarthan karnaa he or jo rajaneta is shrenee main aate hai, desh ke liye vastav main unka koi upyog nahin he
 Hazare has also faced severe criticism from the Congress and the NCP for allegedly calling politicians and some voters corrupt and dishonest
 is maamle main 73 varshiya gandhivadi samajasevi ne kaha ki is desh ke matadaataaon ke charitra ko badnaam karne ke liye raajnneetik party or rajaneta jimmedaar hai
 Politicians generally use black money to distribute power to voters during power and elections
 unhone sawaal kiya, ‘kya aaj gun sampann or achche naitik gunon vaale pratyaashee bagaiyr kaale dhan ke upyog ke bina chunaav main jeet hasil kar sakate hai
 On a question asked about Union Minister Sharad Pawar, he said, "I am not against Pawar as a person but i am against the trend he shows
 ’ bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan main mili samarthan ke liye hajaare ne aam aadmi or gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ke prati aabhaar jataayaa

 kya ye mumkin he ki ek vaqt main ek hi naam kaa teacher teen alag-alag zilon main ek saath padhaa rahaa ho or teenon ke pita ke naam, aadhaar card or pan card bhi ek hi hon
 This is happening in Uttar Pradesh government primary schools
 inamen ek teacher asli he or baaqi farzi
 When several such cases came up one after another, the Special Task Force was given the responsibility of investigation
 is jaanch main ab tak 4000 se zyaada aise farzi teacheron kii pahchaan kar lee gai he
 It is expected that their number is much more than this
 kaha to ye bhi ja rahaa he ki primary shiksha par uttar pradesh sarkaar ke 65 hazaar karod ke bajet kaa qareeb 10 se 15 hazaar karod aise hi farzi teachers par kharch ho rahaa he
 Anil Yadav who teaches in a primary school in Gorakhpur
 lekin anil yadav sitpur or ambedkarnagar ke bhi primary skool main padhaa rahe the
 When he filed ITR for the first time, it came to know that two more teachers are getting salary from his PAN number and his name, father's name and Aadhaar number are all the same
 anil yadav ko jab pataa chalaa to hosh ud gaya hoga ki kahin nakli vaale inaki hatya kar khud ko anil yadav na sabit kar den
 Anil Yadav is currently at Campierganj in Gorakhpur
 unhone kaha, 'maansik rup se uljhan kii thi ki itiar daakhil nahin ho paa rahaa tha
 There was a lot of confusion
 hamako lag rahaa tha ki ham hi ko mukadmaa na daakhil karnaa pad jaae
 We have to prove that i am an original
 yaa aglaa mujhe nakli sabit karne ke chakkar main he'
 Earlier, there were different teachers in the district
 anil yadav medhaavi the unka 6 jilon main chayan ho gaya
 Counseling everywhere and joined Gorakhpur i
e
 6 posts left vacant
 or ab dekhie kii frod kaisaa hua
 Anil Yadav said that he had written an application by hand and sent it to STF Lucknow
 uske aadhaar par jaanch hui to pataa chalaa ki unke farji dastavejon ke aadhaar par koi doosraa anil kumaar yadav sitapur main kahin par naukari kar rahaa he
 When he was caught, it was found that his brother was also working in Ambedkar Nagar in his name
 yahi kahani gorakhpur ke khoyapattee primary skool ke abhaya laal yadav kii bhi he
 They were also selected in many districts
 lekin abhaya laal ne bhi gorakhpur ko hi naukari ke liye chunaa or baaki jagahon main inke naam se bhi kai farji log naukari kar rahe the
 Abhay Lal was also afraid of proving himself to be fake
 abhaya laal ne bataaya, 'bahut dar lag rahaa tha kyonki kai baar mujhe lakhanu or sitapur janaa hota tha kyonki jisane bhi yah kiya hoga vah sahi to rahaa nahin hoga
 The second was the fear that something might happen to us because those people all came to know and the day i went to Sitapur, they all left school and ran away
 abhaylal yadav ko khud ko abhaya laal yadav sabit karne main bahut se papad belane pade
 He was examined in every school where he studied
 abhaya laal ne bataaya ki bses sahab ne ek samiti banaai jahaan 3 se 4 logon ne puri jaanch kii
 The investigation took place till the committee home and from where high school, intermediate, BA and b
ed were done
 uske baad cameti ne apni report di
 Both fake teachers were dismissed based on that report
 vahiin barabanki main estf ne do aise adhyapakon ko giraftaar kiya jo pita or putr hai
 STF told about the case that Girijesh Kumar Tripathi got the job in 1997 by applying the degree of another teacher Jayakush Dubey
 phir unhone bataaya ki apane bete aditya treepathi ke saal 2016 main balig hone par ek duusare teacher ravishankar treepathi kii degree istemaal kar naukari dilaa di
 However Girijesh claims that he is not fake
 ye to un donon ke ghar ke naam hai
 However, the matter did not seem to end here
 estf kahaan to ek maamle kii jaanch ke liye nikali thi lekin yahaan to 'ek dhudhon to hajaar milane' vaali kahawat lagu ho rahi thi or dekhte hi dekhte hi 4000 farji teacher mil chuke the
 The budget for primary education in Uttar Pradesh is 65 thousand crore rupees
 farji adhyaaapak kii jaanch karne waalon kaa andeshaa he ki isamen 1 xxrep 4 0 se 15000 hajaar karod rupee salanaa in farji shikshakon par kharch ho rahaa he
 STF IG Amitabh Yash said that when the investigation work started, it seemed that it was a small matter
 lekin baad main itani badi samasya nikal ai he
 The first reveal was in Mathura where 85 teachers were mentioned
 bareli main giraftaar farji adhyaaapak umesh kumaar or vinay kumaar 40-40 lakh rupee kii selary ab tak paa chuke hai
 In Siddharthnagar, fake teacher Rakesh Singh also got stolen in the BSA office after the distinction was revealed, in which his degree was also stolen
 jab vahaan ek clerk rakesh mani ko pataa chalaa to vah rakesh singh ko blackmel karne laga
 Troubled by this, Rakesh Singh got two women registered cases of rape on Rakesh Mani
 isi tarah bindeshwari pehle shiksha vibhaag main safai karmchaaree the
 Later a teacher became a teacher by applying the degree of Sasikesh
 STF ke aiji amitabh yash ne bataaya, ' siddharthanagar biese ke stano harendra singh ko kai farji teacher kii jaankaree ho gai thi
 The STF alleges that Steno Saheb got a fake letter pad printed in the name of social worker Faheem and then demanded the name of the fake teacher to be investigated on the same letterpad in the name of BSA
 biese ke naam post kii gai chitthee stano sahab ke hi paas ai thi
 He used to enter that letter in the register and then called the fake teacher and said that a letter has come against you for conducting a check of being a fake teacher
 ise dabaane main bahut rupaya kharch hoga phir kya hoga aap samaj sakate hai'
 Amitabh Yash said, their number is very high and it can be even more than we have anticipated
 
 Considering this, a committee was formed in every district which will verify the employees of the Basic Education Department who give salary
 har kisi kaa satyaapan hona he lekin durbhaagya se abhi tak kisi samiti ne report nahin di he
 1- Getting a job with fake degrees 2- dusron ke naam par naukari paanaa 3- Get a job with a fake appointment letter without applying
 4-farji jati praaanpatr se rigerveshan se naukari paanaa
 5- Get a job with quota by creating fake disabled certificate
 6- alpsankhyak skulon main naakaabil doston or rishtedaaron ko cote ke jariye naukari dilava dena
 STF says that this forgery is so big that our team is too small to catch everyone

 kal tak jo dabi jubaan se darindagi ke kisse bayaan kar rahe the, aaj wo sab chup baithe hai
 In such a situation, the real story of the alleged gang rape with more than ten women will ever come to the fore, this is a big question
 
 From the ladies clothes scattered on the roadside to the burnt vehicles, at first sight, there is a doubt that there has been some incident like rape or gang rape with women
 jat andolan ke dauraan yahaan gundon ne musafiron ke saath lutpaat kii thi
 It is possible that during the robbery, a passenger's brifcase broke down and shattered each other
 police kaa yahaan tak kahana he ki agar kisi ladki ke saath yahaan gundon ne gangrape hi kiya hota, to koi naa koi shikaayat lekar unke paas jarur pahunchataa
 The police are even saying that they have neither found any eyewitness of such an incident nor the investigation so far found pictures of any such incident in CCTV cameras installed in nearby dhabas or shops
 lekin tark kii kasuti main police kaa ye inkaar philhal kamazor najar aata he
 The question is that if the clothes fell there during the robbery with someone, then why should only the women's clothes be found? In such a situation, there should have been other things besides Ladies Under Garments
 akhbaar main chhapi reports ke mutabik to nagn haalat main kuch mahilaayein paas ke dhabas main madad maangane ke liye bhi pahunchi thi
 The allegation is even that the police had run away from the police station showing the fear of the local people and the law for the complaint
 jabaki police khud bhi ye maanati he ki ab tak tamaam sisitivi footage kii jaanch puri nahin hui he
 The question of how police work is the biggest question in this suspected ten gang rape case
 shaayad isi baat ko dekhte hue hai court ne is vaardaat ko naa sirf sharmasaar karne vaala qaraar diya he, balki yahaan tak kaha he ki unke paas maamle kosibiaike hawaale karne kaa bhi opshan he

 Taking a dig at Sonia Gandhi too, the BJP spokesperson said that the UPA chairperson could not escape her responsibility and accountability to give the alleged weak prime minister to the country, as it is the Congress chief who gave political strength and power to Manmohan Singh

 yah bahut hi stabdhkaari baat he ki aaj bharat ko duniya ke sabase bhrasht deshon main gina jaataa he
 The BJP spokesperson said that India has become helpless, insecure and infirm during Singh's nine-year rule

 After the Lok Sabha elections, Bahujan Samaj Party (BJP) chief Mayawati has made a big change in the party structure
 mayawati ne apane bhai anand kumaar ko ek baar phir party kaa rashtriya upaadhyaksh banaaya he jabaki bhattije akaash anand ko rashtriya samanvayak kii jimmedaari di gai he
 This is the second time Mayawati has given Anand Kumar such a big position in the party
 kuch din pehle mayawati ne party upaadhyaksh ke pad se anand kumaar ko hataa diya tha
 It was then said that he took this step when he was accused of nepotism
 magar sawaal he ki yadi unhen bhai bhatijawad kii itani phikr hoti to phir parivaar ke logon ko party main ahm pad ke liye kyon chunaa gaya?asal main 2012, 2014, 2017 main haar, or 2019 main bhi apekshit safalataa na milane se mayawati dabaav main hai
 Over the years, the departure of the party's strong leaders Swami Prasad Maurya, Nasimuddin Siddiqui and Brajesh Pathak has led to a shortage of credible people in the BSP on whom Mayawati continues to trust
 in baton ke bhi kayaas lagaaye ja rahe hai ki kya maujuuda sthiti main mayawati kamjor mahasoos kar rahi hai? anand kumaar ko phir se basapa main laane ke peeche vah kya soch rahi hai? kya apane khaas netaaon ke party chhod kar chale jane ke baad mayawati ko bispi ko sanbhaalane main dikkat aa rahi he? kya isiilie mayawati ne anand kumaar ko basapa kaa padaadhikari banaaya he taaki vah party ko phir se khadaa karne main unka madadgaar ban saken?kis par karen bharosaswaal yah bhi he ki kya mayawati ko ab dusron par se bharosa uth gaya he? athwa mayawati ko lagane laga he ki raajnneeti main bhi sagaa hi apana hota he
 It is being said in the political corridor that the current situation shows that Mayawati cannot trust anyone other than Anand Kumar
 basapa kaa itihaas bataata he ki mayawati ne raajnneeti main jise bhi kareebi mana, usee shaks ne party kaa daaman chhod virdohi dalon kaa haath thama he
 The names of Swami Prasad Maurya and Nasimuddin Siddiqui topped them
 swami prasad maurya ek samay mayawati ke daahine haath kahe jate the, lekin unhone bhagava gamchaa odh liya
 The same story was repeated with Nasimuddin Siddiqui and he held up the Congress
 viraasat kii chintasth kii umr paar kar chukin mayawati ko party viraasat kii bhi chintaa he
 However, Mayawati has said that Satishchandra Mishra will never succeed her
 unhone 14 april 2017 ko saaf kaha tha ki basapa main unka uttaradhikari koi dalit yaa muslim hi ho saktaa he
 However, Danish Ali has been made the leader of the BSP in the Lok Sabha, and his son Akash Kumar along with Anand Kumar has been given important responsibility in the party
 kya mana jaae ki party main mayawati ne wo nayaa cheharaa khoj liya he jis par vah bharosa kar saken? On 26 January 1950, when India offered itself the world's longest constitution, its creators had a vision for the future of the country
 lekin unhone ascharyajanak rup se na to do shabdon, ‘‘rajnatik dalya kaa ullekh kiya or na hi bajet shabd kaa hawala diya
 Today, after 60 years of drafting Indian democracy, the country is moving around these words
 raajnneeti or nitiyaan bahutayat main hai par maahaul main koi ummid nahin he, koi prastaav nahin, is par koi baatcheet nahin ki chune jane par partiyon yaa pratyaashiyon kaa kya karne kaa lakshya he yaa ve kya kaam puraa karne kii ummid karte hai
 So can we really say that we no longer have a big dream or direction? But the truth is that the agenda of civil society is flying high
 anna hajaare ke bhrashtachar virdohi andolan se lekar dilli gang rape ke virodh pradarshan tak raashtra ne uth khadey hone, apni bhi ginati karaane or bolne kaa saahas paa liya he
 The country has gathered the courage to demand liberal government, transparency in public life and accountability from those in public positions
 yahaan ham 2013 ke liye aise 13 prastaav de rahe hai jinaki logon ko maang kerani chahie or rajnatik varg ko ise puraa karnaa chahie
 Now the time has come for the election to be called 'new' with no agenda

 The committee consists of Justice Reddy and Justice Shah raajnneeti viraasat main to mil sakati he lekin raajnneeti main apana khud kaa mukaam banane ke liye mehnat bhi ji-tod kerani padati he
 Who can understand this better than Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi? ise kuch aise bhi kah sakate hai
 
 ye raajnneeti nahin asaan , itnaa to samaj lijieek aag kaa dariyaa he , or dub ke janaa he
 
 
 After all, where does Rahul get the courage and strength to stay steadfast in the field even after facing adverse situations? Recently Rahul himself has given the answer to this
 or wo he ekido
 Ekido, that form of Japanese martial arts, which is called the path of integration with life energy
 ekido ke rahul gandhise judaav se pehle thodi najar unke ab tak ke raajnneetik safar par bhi daal lee jaae
 Rahul has completed 13 years in active politics after becoming MP from Amethi for the first time in 2004
 is dauraan unhone kaaphi utaar-chadhaav bhi dekhe
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress saw the worst electoral defeat in its history, even after that the 'grand Old Party' lost in successive state assembly elections
 lekin itani paraajayon ke baavjood vichlit hue bina rahul raajnneeti ke path par badhate rahe hai
 With this mission and hope that the Congress will get back its lost support base one day
 is dauraan virodhiyon ke raajnneetik tiron kaa bhi ve lagaataar saamana karte rahe
 As much ridicule was given on social media by giving Rahul a special name, it did not appear to happen to any other leader in the recent past
 rahul naa jhukne vaale yoddha kii tarahraajnneeti ke ran memlgataar date hai
 Despite the fact that after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, many critics had even advised him to quit politics
 lekin ye 2014 nahin 2017 he
 Is the situation changing for Rahul too? Now, while the speeches are being felt in his speeches, his sarcastic sarcasm on social media is also getting better response than before
 raajnneeti ke agnipath par aage badhane ke liye jis majboot mindset or fitness kii jarurat hoti he, uske liye rahul ko marshall art ekido ne kaaphi had tak madad kii he
 It is not anyone else but his ekido guru
 ekido main rahul ko daksh karne vaale unke guru sensoi paritosh kar ne ‘aaj tak’ se khaas baatcheet main bataaya ki kis tarah is marshall art ne rahul par gahari chhap chodi
 The fighting skills of sword and knife are not only taught in Ekido
 sensoi paritosh ke mutabik rahul ne unase kaha, ‘ekido se mujhe bahut kuch seekhney ko mila he, aap mere guru ho or main ekido ko kabhi nahin chhoduunga
 'rahul's ekido guru also says that just as ekido is not aggressive, in the same way Rahul is not aggressive in life
 sensoi paritosh kehete hai, ‘main or rahul pehali baar 2009 main mili or tabhi se rahul kaa ekido se saath chalaa aa rahaa he
 We practice regularly
 agle do teen maheene ve zyada practice nahin kar paaenge
 Earlier i used to visit his house regularly
 ’sensoi paritosh bataate hai kiraahul apanedo or doston ke saath apane ‘12 tughlaq len’ awaas par ekido kaa abhyaas karte hai
 Sometimes his mother Sonia Gandhi and sister Priyanka also come to see it
 sensoi paritosh ke mutabik 2013 main japan se ekido master bharat aae the or tab rahul ne imtihaan diya tha 
 At that time Rahul had passed the test and got his black belt, Rahul had also gone to Japan and had learned many tricks related to this martial art in the headquarters there for 10 days
 sensoi paritosh kii kul milakar rahul ke bare main yahi raay he ki ve bahut feet insaan he, sports main ruchi rakhane ke saath khud bhi har din ek ghanta sports ko dete hai
 Along with this, Ekido has supported him well in increasing mental fitness

 ) chhattisgarh ke grahamantri ram sevak pakara vaaki balashaali hai yaa nahin ise lekar rajnatik galiyaaron main in dinon charchaa chhidi hui he
 In fact, due to the absence of any inquiry from the Home Minister in the Police Transfer Board, he has remained as the Home Minister for the legislators
 vidhayakon, saansadon or netaaon ke sifarish par police karmiyon ke transfar nahin hone se ab vipaksh hi nahin sattadhari dal ke vidhayak bhi grahamantri kii shaktiyon ko lekar tanj kasne main peeche nahin hai
 Where the opposition is pinching the home minister within the assembly, the legislators of the ruling party in their rooms
 sabhi kaa tark ek hi he ki aakhir kyon power les ho gaye hai grih mantri ji
 In the Chhattisgarh Assembly, Congress lashed out at the state Home Minister Ram Sewak Packra
 un par tanj kasate hue kota ke vidhayak or up netaa pratipaksh kavasi lakhma ne kaha ki grih mantri kii na to chaparasi sunata he or na hi dijipi
 Due to this, an atmosphere of fear has been created in the state
 kavasi lakhma ne kaha ki pradesh main na to vyapaaree surakshit he or na hi aam aadmi
 Neither girls are safe nor young
 gunde badmaashon ke aatank ke chalate logon main bhay kaa maahaul he
 Actually, the opposition was trying to take the government in the face of law and order in the state
 isi ke saath grih mantri par bhi tanj ksaa ja rahaa he
 MLA from Raipur Rural and former minister Satya Narayan Sharma also took a dig at the state Home Minister Ram Sewak Packra
 unhone kaha ki ram sevak pakara grahamantri hone ke baavjood ek sipaahi kaa transfar nahin kar sakate
 The opposition party is not second to taunting Chief Minister Raman Singh and his government these days regarding the position of the Home Minister in the Assembly
 darasal vipaksh grahamantri kii aad main mukhyamantri par nishaanaa saadhane kii koshish main juta he
 Actually the MLA or the leader of the ruling party or opposition
 police karmiyon ke tabadale ke liye aksar ve grahamantri kaa darwaja khatkhataate hai
 The Home Minister, on hearing his plea, sends the name of the police personnel associated with the notesheet to the police headquarters for inclusion in the transfer list
 is ummid main ki police karmi ko raahat milegi uskaa transfar ho jayega, lekin nateeja sifer rahata he
 In the last four years, Home Minister Ram Sewak Packra wrote hundreds of notesheets regarding the transfer of police personnel
 lekin bamushkil ek yaa do police karmiyon kaa transfar ho paaya
 That too when the aggrieved policeman rubbed his nose on the doorstep of the top officers
 aamtaur par mantri apane vibhaag ke survey sarva maane jate hai
 It is expected that every decision of his department is taken on his instructions, but this is not happening with the Home Minister of Chhattisgarh
 grih vibhaag ne unhen mahatvapurn faislon se darkinar kar rakhaa he
 In fact, they do not even have the right to transfer a soldier
 vidhansabha main vipakshiyon ke aaropon kii padtaal karne par yah baat saamne ai ki vaaki chhattisgarh ke grahamantri ko afasaron ne power les bana diya he
 Top officers only listen to the Chief Minister
 mukhyamantri sachivalay kii noteshit unki teble par teji se daudti he
 Whereas the Home Minister's notesheet is captured directly in the cupboard
 police transfar board main prakaran rakhane kaa hawala dekar aalaa afasar aksar grahamantri kii noteshit par yahi tip likh kar use apni almaari main rakh dete hai
 Then, year after year, a new notesheet appears in that file
 isliye ab vipaksh bhi grahamantri ko 'naam bade darshan chote' kaa kitaab dene main juta he
 On the other hand, the words of the opposition make Banana smiling with the ease of Home Minister Ram Sewak Packra
 wo karen bhi to kya, hakeekat wo bakhubi jaanate hai
 At present, due to the weak grip of the Home Minister, politicians are considering it appropriate for the transfer of police personnel to the Chief Minister's court
 supreme court kii taraf se niyukt esaiti kii maamle ko band karne kii report ke khilaaf jakiya jaafaree kii yachika par yahaan kii adaalat somvaar ko faisla suna sakati he

 After completing the investigation on Jafri's complaint, the SIT had filed an inquiry report on February 8, 2012, stating that it could not be proved from whatever evidence could be collected despite the difficulty of collecting evidence due to the passage of eight years
 That those who were charged with conspiracy for the 2002 riots were involved in it

 adheer ranjan ne grih mantri rajnath singh ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki aap kehete hai ki kashmir hamaara aantarik mudda he
 But the Kashmir case has been under the supervision of the United Nations since 1948

 We had a stand on Lahore Declaration

 Amit Shah said that the government has broken which rule Adhir Ranjan tell it, the government will answer it
 amit shah ne kaha ki congress netaa ko general statement nahin dena chahie
 Adhir Ranjan also said that s Jaishankar had told Mike Ponpio a few days ago that Kashmir is a bilateral issue
 isamen hastkshep na karen
 Is Jammu and Kashmir still an internal issue? Amit Shah said, 'congress should clear its stand on this matter
 congress bataae ki kya kashmir ko sanyukt raashtra (yuan) monitor kare

 ("the machine harps happily and we drink to ink, that makes our stomach sink and teaches us to fear everything", "fear the beasts riding the night from Delhi to Pondicherry" and "the pleasant opening page revealing a fair and lovely face, which melts a few pages on with rise of acid sales

 chennai ke eme chidambaram stadium par bharat or newjiland ke bich doosraa twanti-20 match shuru hone se pehle hi samaa bandha chukaa tha
 The audience had reached in large numbers and it was natural that everyone's name was Yuvraj Singh, who was returning to international cricket after conquering cancer
 yuvaraj ne apane samarthakon ko tanik bhi niraash nahin kiya or gendbaaji, kshetrarakshan tathaa ballebaaji teenon main acha pradarshan kiya
 Yuvraj, however, would be disappointed that he could not win the team despite a good performance in all the three departments of the game and suffered a one-run defeat to New Zealand in a thrilling contest
 yuvaraj ek baar phir puraani lay main lautate hue dikh rahe hai
 He made 34 runs with the help of one four and two sixes in 26 balls and also took a catch
 unhone do over gendbaaji karte hue 14 ran die or apni majboot vaapasi se pratidwandviyon ko cheta diya ki vah ek baar phir unki neend udaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Yuvraj batted in his old style during this period
 unhone newjiland ke purv captain or diggaj spinner danniel vittori kii gend par wide long on par chakka bhi jadaa
 He hit his second six over Jacob Oram at deep midwicket
 vah haalanki bhaagyashaal bhi rahe jab adam milne par pul shot khilne kii koshish main gend ko hawa main laharaa gaye, lekin boundry se bhagkar aa rahe mills or wicketiper makkulam kaaphi koshish ke baavjood kaich nahin lapak gaye
 During this time there was also a very sharp fight between Mills and mccullum, after which the game stopped for some time and Mills had to go out with an injury
 darshakon ke haathon main bade-bade binar or takhtiyaan thim, jin par yuvaraj ko vaapasi kii badhai di gai thi
 The Indian team decided to field first and when Yuvraj stepped on the field, he was greeted with a thunderous sound
 baayen haath ke is ballebaaj ne bhi haath hilaakar darshakon kaa abhivadan sweekaar kiya
 India initially crushed New Zealand by taking two wickets
 isse darshak adhik romanchit ho gaye, lekin chepak stadium shor ke agosh main khaskar tab duba, jab pehali baar yuvaraj ke paas gend gai
 He was fielding at midwicket and showed chronic agility and agility in the first over to stop Martin Guptill's shot
 bharat ke chotii ke kshetrarakshakon main se ek yuvaraj ne tisare over main ken williamsan ke shot ko dive markar roka or saaf kar diya ki unhen phir se puraane rang main lautne main koi dikkat nahin he
 In the next over of Yuvraj, Brandon mccullum hit a six, but after that he tried his best to convert this batsman's tough shot into a catch
 gend unke haath se chhitakkar chali gai
 Yuvraj was injured by this and had to undergo treatment on the field
 darshak ekbargi unki chot se sann rah gaye the, lekin jaise hi vah over kii antim gend karne ke liye aae, to phir se stadium 'yuvi-yuvi' se gunjane laga
 The comments dhoni ne bhi yuvaraj ke is prayaas kii saraahna kii
 Yuvraj conceded 14 runs in his two overs
 yuvaraj ko iske baad maidan chhodana padaa, jisase darshak bhi maayoos ho gaye
 Harbhajan Singh, his special friend and returning to the team after more than a year to field, replaced Yuvraj
 yuvaraj haalanki adhik der tak baahar nahin rahe or jald hi maidan par laut aae
 After this he also caught a catch
 lagbhag saadhe teen saal baad bhartiya team main vaapasi karne vaale lakshmipathi balaji kii gend ko james franklin ne hawa main laharaa diya or yuvaraj ne cover point par daudkar use kaich kar liya
 The audience stood up from their seats
 yuvaraj ko badhai dene ke liye sabase pehle suresh raina pahunche or baad main captain dhoni sahit baaki khilaadiyon ne bhi unhen gher liya
 Yuvraj did not disappoint his supporters at all and performed well in the bowling, fielding and batting trio
 yuvaraj ko haalanki is baat kii niraashaa hogi ki khel ke teenon vibhaagon main umdaa pradarshan ke baavjood vah team ko jeet nahin dilaa sake or romaanchak mukaable main use newjiland ke haathon ek ran se shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Yuvraj is once again seen returning to the old rhythm
 unhone 26 gend main ek chauke or do chhakkon kii madad se 34 ran kii pari khilne ke alaava ek kaich bhi lapka
 He bowled two overs, conceding 14 runs and with his strong return, warned the rivals that he was ready to blow his sleep once again
 yuvaraj ne is dauraan apane puraane andaaj main ballebaaji kii
 He also hit a six off wide long on off former New Zealand captain and veteran spinner Daniel Vettori
 unhone apana doosraa chakka jacob oram par deep midwicket par maaraa
 However, he was also lucky when trying to play a pull shot on Adam Milne in the air, but Mills and wicketkeeper mccullum, who were running from the boundary, did not catch the catch despite a lot of effort
 is dauraan mills or makkulam ke bich kaaphi tej takkar bhi hui, jiske baad kuch der khel rukaa rahaa or mills ko chotil hokar baahar janaa padaa
 The audience had huge banners and placards in their hands, on which Yuvraj was congratulated for his return
 bhartiya team ne pehle kshetrarakshan kaa faisla kiya or jab yuvaraj ne maidan par kadam rakhaa, to kartal dhwani se unka swaagat kiya gaya
 This left-handed batsman also shook hands and accepted the greetings of the audience
 bharat ne shuru main do wicket chatkaakar newjiland kii haalat khasta kar di thi
 This thrilled the spectators more, but the Chepak Stadium was submerged in the noise when the ball went to Yuvraj for the first time
 vah midwicket par kshetrarakshan kar rahe the or unhone pehle over main hi martin guptil ke shot ko rokane main puraani furti or chapaltaa dikhaai
 Yuvraj, one of India's top fielders, stopped Kane Williamson's shot by diving in the third over and made it clear that he had no problem returning to the old color again
 yuvaraj ke agle over main brandan makkulam ne chakka lagaaya, lekin iske baad unhone isi ballebaaj ke karaare shot ko kaich main tabdeel karne kii puri koshish kii
 The ball went out of his hand
 yuvaraj isse chotil ho gaye or unhen maidan par upachaar lenaa padaa
 The spectators were once stunned by his injury, but as soon as he came in to bowl the final ball of the over, the stadium started buzzing with 'yuvi-yuvi' again
 tippaniyan Dhoni also praised Yuvraj's effort
 yuvaraj ne apane do over main 14 ran die
 Yuvraj had to leave the field after this, which also disappointed the audience
 yuvaraj kii jagah kshetrarakshan karne ke liye unke khaas mitra or ek saal se bhi adhik samay baad team main vaapasi kar rahe harbhajan singh maidan par utre
 Yuvraj, however, did not stay out for long and soon returned to the ground
 iske baad unhone ek kaich bhi lapka
 Laxmipathy Balaji, who returned to the Indian team after almost three and a half years, was flown in the air by James Franklin and was caught by Yuvraj at cover point
 darshak apni siton se khadey ho gaye
 Suresh Raina first arrived to congratulate Yuvraj and later he was surrounded by other players including captain Dhoni
 yuvaraj ek baar phir puraani lay main lautate hue dikh rahe hai
 He made 34 runs with the help of one four and two sixes in 26 balls and also took a catch
 unhone do over gendbaaji karte hue 14 ran die or apni majboot vaapasi se pratidwandviyon ko cheta diya ki vah ek baar phir unki neend udaane ke liye taiyaar hai

 It has been 27 years since a woman tennis player has won the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open in 12 months, the last time a 1988 Grand Slam win was won by Germany's Steffi Graf in 1988
 is saal toornament main apana pehla match serena williams ek sitambar ko khelengi or un par graph ke karname ko dohraane kaa dabaav hoga
 Serena has won the US Open last year and also won the first three slams of this year
 graph ne jab ye karnama kiya tab vah 19 saal kii thi lekin serena kii umr 33 saal he
 There may be a big difference between the ages of the two, but there is not much difference in the form
 saal 1988 main graph apane kariyar ke top par thi or serena bhi top form main hai
 However, the graph warns Serena to avoid fatigue
 graph ne us pal ko yaad karte hue kaha, 'mujhe yaad he main yues open se pehle kaafii thakaan mahasoos kar rahi thi, kyonki sabhi logon ko mujhase jeet kii ummid thi jisaki vajah se meraa dam ghutane laga tha or main toornament par dhyaan nahin laga paa rahi thi
 'graff said about Serena, which is why Serena seems to be meeting fewer people before the tournament
 jab graph ne calendar slam jeeta tha, tab martina navaratilova or kris ewart jaisi khilaadi apane kariyar ke aakiri padaav par thi, lekin yahaan serena ke saamne kai chunautiyaan hai
 Serena's opponents are quite young and have the ability to challenge her hard
 graph kii tarah serena ne ab tak khele teen grand slam toornament ke final main teen alag-alag khilaadi ko haraaya he
 Serena, who won 21 singles titles, won the US Open in 1999 at the age of 17
 tippaniyan Before the tournament, Serena is not too worried about the pressure on her
 serena ne kaha, 'main dabaav jhelane ke liye taiyaar hum
 i win or i win or i stay on par
 isse mujhe koi fark nahin padataa
 i am ready to start and finish the tournament and then think about the next tournament
 ' Given Serena's current form, it is certain that her claim is strong enough and her reign on women's tennis will continue for some more time to come

 Players like Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert were nearing the end of their careers when Graf won the calendar slam, but Serena faces many challenges here

 The comments toornament se pehle serena apane upar dabaav ko lekar zyaada pareshaan nahin hai

 Petitions seeking a fair investigation into the Judge BH Loya case were heard in the Supreme Court on Thursday
 SC ne saaf kaha ki is maamle kii koi jaanch nahin hogi
 After this decision, BJP leaders have become aggressive on the Congress and are constantly issuing statements
 isi kadi main kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne rahul gandhi par hamalaa karte hue kaha, 'congress party ko desh se maafee maangani chahie
 Pappu should focus on his sin
 'mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne is faisle par kaha, 'satyamev jayate, satya kii jeet hui he
 The conspiracy and conspiracy to ruin and malign PM Modi and Amit Shah have failed
 rahul gandhi, sonia gandhi, congress party ko desh se maafee maangani chahie
 Such a low comment is rare
 congress ko aatmachintan karnaa chahie
 Pappu should focus on his sin
 'nyaaypalika ko badnaam karne kii koshish: rajnath sinhavahin, grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha- yah afsos kii baat he kiraajnneetik hitonko saadhane ke liye nyaaypalika kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 This should not happen, but our political opponents are doing this to discredit the government, our leaders and the judiciary
 bataa den,jaj loyaces par aae is faisle ke baad bijepi ne apane netaaon ko bayaan jari karne ko kaha he
 That is why all the leaders of BJP are expressing their views on this matter on their own behalf
 kya he puraa maamla?bataa den ki justise loya bahucharchit soharabuddin shaikh maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the
 Tulsiram, a witness of the Sohrabuddin encounter, was also killed
 amit shah ke pesh na hone par jataai thi naarazgimaamle se jude trial ko supreme court ne maharashtra main transfar kiya tha
 The judge was hearing the case earlier, but expressed displeasure at BJP president Amit Shah not appearing in the case
 jiske baad unka tabadalaa ho gaya tha
 After this, Justice Loya had heard the case

 Voting is going on for the assembly elections in Nagaland and Meghalaya in the northeast
 donon rajyon ke 59-59 vidhansabha siton par matdaan ho rahaa he
 Polls have been held in Tripura
 in rajyon ke nattejey 3 march ko aaenge
 In such a situation, the election results of three states of the Northeast are considered to be very important for both Congress and BJP
 congress ke liye jahaan purvottar main apane vajood ko bachaae rakhane kii chunauti he, to vahiin bijepi ke liye vaicharik jeet kaa loha manvaanaa he
 These 10 important reasons 1
 meghalaya main congress pichley 10 saal se sarkaar main he
 In such a situation, the challenge is to retain power
 2
 The Congress has only two states left in the Northeast
 inamen mizoram or meghalaya he
 Meghalaya elections are being held and Mizoram assembly elections are due later this year
 3
 Nagaland has been ruled by the Congress government for 15 years, but is struggling for its existence today
 aise congress ne sirf 18 siton par ummidavaar utaare hai
 4
 bijepi 'congress mukt bharat' naare ko lekar chal rahi he, aise main congress or bijepi donon ke liye purvottar kaaphi mahatv vaala chunaav mana ja rahaa he
 5
 bijepi purvottar main ek ke baad ek rajya main apana pair pasaarti ja rahi he
 In such a situation, these states are very important
 6
 After Assam, Manipur and Arunachal, BJP is eyeing Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura
 jise bijepi jeetne kii puri koshish main lagi he
 7
 bijepi ke liye sirf chunavi satta kii jeet nahin balki vaicharik rup se bhi jeet hogi
 That is why BJP has put all its strength
 8
 In Meghalaya, Chief Minister Mukul Sangma is struggling on two fronts - internal dissatisfaction within the party and external challenge from the BJP
 9
 Meghalaya is a Christian dominated area, then Nagaland tribal predominance
 aise main bijepi ke liye vipareet haalat main jeet milti he to kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 10
 purvottar main congress ke janaadhar main bijepi lagaataar sendhamari karne main juty he
 In such a situation where it is important for Congress to win to preserve its existence, it is the challenge for BJP to increase its base
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar pehle charan ke matdaan ke bich endie kii ore se ek badi ghoshnaa kii gai he! bijepi ke star prachaarak shahanvaj hossain ne somvaar ko elaan kiya ki rajya main endie kii sarkaar banane par gaya se party ke varisht netaa dow
 Prem Kumar will be made the Chief Minister
 shahanvaj gaya main party kii ek baithak ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 During the party meeting, he said, 'I urge you to vote overwhelmingly and win your leader Prem Kumar
 vah rajya menmukhyamantri pad ke ummidawaarahain
 If NDA comes to power, he will be the chief minister of the state
 'yah dilachasp he, kyonki shahanvaj ne baithak ke dauraan jo kuch kaha he vah party line se itar kii baat he
 The BJP has not announced the name of the CM candidate before the election results in any state
 isi niti par vah bihar main bhi aage badhanaa chaahati he, lekin is bich main shahanvaj kii yah ghoshnaa anadhikarik hi sahi raajnneetik khalabali ke liye kaaphi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken charge of the party's election campaign
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle jharkhand, haryana or maharashtra ke chunaav main bhi bijepi ne jeet hasil karne ke baad hi mukhyamantri ke ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Who is Dr
 prem kumaradow
 Prem Kumar has been elected as MLA from Bihar Gaya six times
 soshal media par bhi unke samarthakon dwaara unhen siem pad ke liye ahm ummidavaar mana ja rahaa he
 He has been considered as the face of socially and educationally backward class from the party
 kumaar ke samarthakon kaa kahana he ki unke netaa hi piem modi ke vikaswad ko aage le ja sakate hai, lekin khabaron ke mutabik is pad ke liye kumaar ko kuch or bade naamon se takkar leni hogi, jisamen purv up mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi bhi shaamil hai
 Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's Jab Harry Met Sejal has not been able to do anything great at the box office
 shuruaati donon dinon main film kaa collection kam hi hua he, vahiin critics or phens kii ore se bhi film ko lekar bhi koi acha rispons nahin aayaa he
 During this time there is a tweet which is constantly going viral
 'vishaal suryavanshi' naam ke vyakti ne videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko tag karte hue ek twit kiya ki mam, main pune main jab harry met sejal dekh rahaa hum, plis mujhe yahaan se rescue kar lijie
 This tweet by Vishal is continuously going viral on social media and has been retweet about 1000 times
 gauratlab he ki sushamaa swaraj twit ke jariye logon kii madad karti hai, shaayad darshak is film se itnaa pareshaan ho gaya ki usne sidhaa ye apil kar daali
 @sushmaswarajmam, I'm watching # jabharrymetsejalat Xion cinema Hinjewadi, Pune
 Please rescue me as soon as possible
 
 😭😭— Vishal Surywanshi (@vsurywanshi87)august 5, 2017bataa den ki film 'jab harry met sejal' ne pehle din kharaab shuruyaat kii thi
 The film made just 15 on Friday
 25 karod rupye kaa collection kiya
 This is the least opening day collection of films by Shah Rukh Khan in the last five years
 2012 main ai unki film 'jab tak he jaan' ne pehle din 15
 23 crore was collected
 vahiin duusare din yani shanivaar ko sirf 15 karod rupye kaa collection kiya he
 Significantly, when the budget of Harry Met Sejal is 80 crores
 is lihaaj se yah mushkil lag rahaa he ki shaayad hi ye film apni laagat nikaalane main bhi safal rahe
 This week, Akshay Kumar and Bhoomi Padnekar's film Toilet Ek Prem Katha is also going to be released, so Shah Rukh has only a few days left for his film collection
 akshay kii aane vaali film ko lekar senepremiyon main jo hip ban chuki he uske dekhte hue ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki akshay kii ye film shahrukh kii film ko box offis se ondhe munh gir jaae
 When the Harry Met Sejal film revolves around the Acturist Guide
 anoushka europe jaati hai or vahanunaki angesement ring kho jaati he
 After this, Shahrukh and they together find it
 film samikshakon ke anusaar, jab harry met sejal bojhil lagane lagati he
 This has been rejected by most critics due to the high number of songs and lack of newness in the story
 anoushka sharma ke kirdaar main sirf unke gujarati accent ke alaava kuch bhi nayaa nahin he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday washed the dishes at the Golden Temple in Amritsar amid a controversy over the Aam Aadmi Party's manifesto related to the Punjab Legislative Assembly, the BJP terming it as an act of concealment of crime against Sikh Gurus and an injury to the religious faith of Sikhs

 yaman ke huthi vidrohiyon ne shanivaar subah saudi arab kii kachche tel kii rifinary par drone hamale kiye the
 This will affect the supply of crude oil worldwide and India's impact will not remain untouched
 saudi tel company aramko ne kaha ki vah agle kareeb do dinon tak utpaadan ko kam rakhegi taaki kshatigrast hue tel ke kuon kii marammat kii ja sake
 Iran and America are pointing fingers at each other after this attack
 vahiin saudi arab ke urja mantri ne shuruaati anumaan ke aadhaar par bataaya ki hamale se pratidin 57 lakh bairal tel utpaadan ghat gaya he
 Ethane and natural gas supplies are also half affected
 in hamalon kaa nishaanaa sirf saudi arab hi nahin balki duniya kii tel supplai or suraksha par bhi tha
 The question now is how much the impact on oil production in Saudi Arabia can affect India
 aapako bataa den ki bharat duniya main kachche tel kaa teesraa sabase bada upabhokta he
 India imports 80% of its crude oil
 saudi arab kachche tel, rasoi gas kaa bharat kaa doosraa sabase bada saplir he
 If the impact of the rise of crude oil in the international market increases by one dollar per barrel on India's import bill, then India's bill will increase by 10,700 crores annually
 america ke videsh mantri mike pompeo ne ek twit kar hamale ke peeche iran kaa haath bataaya
 He said that Iran is behind the hundred attacks on Saudi Arabia
 iran ne ab duniya kii tel supplai par hamalaa kiya he
 There is no evidence that the attack happened on behalf of Yemen
 is bich iran ne america ke in aaropon kaa sire se khandan kar diya he
 He has called these allegations baseless and meaningless
 is bich sabhi kii nigahen tel kii qimaton par lagi hai
 Some experts are saying that in the international market, the price of oil can increase up to $ 10 per barrel
 agar aisa hua to bharat ke tel aayaat par ye ek bada boj sabit hoga

 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-2-sir main goli maaranakisi ko ghutanon ke bal jameen par bitha kar bilkul kareeb se uske sir main goli maarna kitna bhayanak ho saktaa he, ye iesas ne duniya ko dikhaaya
 Going beyond all the limits of life, this terrorist organization shot and killed a number of unidentified people in the same head, and their treatment with their enemies is still going on
 lekin apane kuch propeganda video main to iesas ne jaise sari hadein kii khatm kar di
 Till now ISIS militants used to shoot their own victims, but now they started doing this work to innocent children too
 ji haa, kabs of kheliphet yani khilaafat ke shaavak ke naam se maasoom bacchon ko dehshatgardi kii aag main jhonk kar iesas ne usne bhi apane dushmano ko goli maravaanaa shuru kar diya
 By the way, ISIS law has its own separate punishment for every crime in the books
 lekin aam taur par jasusi ke jurm main pakade gaye logon aisi maut detaa he
 Forgive Baghdadi's face by throwing it from number-3-up
 The hands of a person are tied in feet
 wo sangeenon ke saaye se ghira he or bhaagna to dur wo apni marji se saans bhi nahin le saktaa
 He is taken to the top floor of a building in the same condition
 phir imaarat ke neeche khadey logon ke bich munaadi kar uske gunahon kii kahani sunaane ke baad use upar se sidhe neeche dhakel diya jaataa he
 This is such a scene, which only makes Rongte stand up after thinking about it
 lekin iesas ke raaj main samalangik hona, aisa gunaah he jiske liye bas yahi maut banati he
 Baghdadi's face number-4-sangarsa, to kill, to be crushed with stones
 kya kuch insaan apane hi jaise insaanon kii jaan pattharon se kuchal kar le sakate hai? aapke liye sochna beshak mushkil ho, bahut se kattar muslim mulkon main aaj bhi aisa karnaa kaanoon ke daayre main hai
 Then ISIS is ahead of all limits of hatred and bigotry
 lihaaza, iesas bhi aksar aise dardanaak tareeqe se logon kii jaan letaa rahaa he
 By the way, the victims of the association are often more women who are accused of illegitimate relationships with someone
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-5-aag main jalaakar marnapinjre main kaid ne in turki ke sainik ko jo maut di gai usne bagdadi kii ghatati dehshat ko phir se zindaa kar diya
 Baghdadi, fueled by Turkish intervention in Syria, held these soldiers in a cage before killing them
 jaanwaron kii tarah ghutanon ke bal chalaaya or phir haivaaniyat kii aisi ibaarat likhi, jise shaayad itani aasaani bhulaay nahin ja sakegaa
 These ammo straps were transported through chains and then fastened to them
 lohe kii in zanjiron main bhaagane kii koi gunjaaish nazar nahin aa rahi he
 Baghdadi's henchmen are recording every moment of fear before death on camera
 dar ke maare inkaa galaa is kadar khushk pad chukaa he
 These Turkish soldiers, who had already been bathed in petrol, were thrown into the fire of death
 kaale libaas vaale is yamraj ne maut kaa remote nikaal liya
 This remote is actually the trigger of the gunpowder that is touching their bodies passing through this iron chain
 trigar dabaa or barood ne aag pakad lee
 Momentum Momentum Death started increasing rapidly
 jindagi ne in lapaton main jhulas kar dam tod diya
 With the face of Baghdadi in number-6-boat, hardly any executioner in Marithaar has found out as many ways of death as Baghdadi gave to his criminals in this one year, the death he gave to these 6 hostages, no one else should Give
 iesas ke in darinde ne maut kaa ye dardanaak khel khilne ke liye tamaam intezaam kiye hai
 One by one they were placed in this white boat
 video main nazar aa rahaa he ki do bandhak pehle se baithe hue the or baaki ke chaar bandhakon ko ye do aatanki gardan se pakadakar boat kii taraf le ja rahe hai
 In pairs of two, these hostages were placed in the boat
 
 The fear of death is clearly visible on everyone's face
 ye jaanate hai ki yahaan se batch paanaa naammumkin he, lekin magar jaalim bagdadi ke bandhakon ko maut bhi aasaani se nahin milti
 It is also difficult to guess the horror of the very young boys sitting in the boat
 naav main bithakar pehle inke haath pair baandh die gaye
 The boat was then abandoned in the middle of the water
 boat pani main tair rahi, maut raftaa raftaa kareeb aati rahi
 Baghdadi's face number-7 - drowned in water is the cage of Mao Lohe from which it is impossible to get out
 pinjre main lage chote-chote camere
 These cruel terrorists will record the scene of death in it
 ek-ek kar 5 kaidiyon ko naarangi rang ke jampasoot pahana kar pinjre main bheja gaya
 There is a fear of death on everyone's faces
 tabhi ek ishaara milte hi kraine is pinjade ko pani ke bich-bich le ai or dhire dhire pinjade ko pani main duubano shuru kar diya gaya
 The cage was first filled in half and then to the mouth
 pijadaa pani ke andar chalaa gaya or jab waapas nikaala gaya to saansein ruk chuki thim
 He tied the face of Baghdadi with number 8-explosive and killed the seven people who came under the claws of ISIS in the blasphemous crime that left the world shaken
 narsanhaar kii ye tasviren aisi he ki inhen kisi bhi surat dikhaa paanaa mumkin nahin he
 7 people were taken captive to the open ground
 sabhi kaidiyon ke haath peeche kar ke baandh gaye or inaki gardanon main nile rang kii explosive vir ko baandha gaya phir datonator ke dhamaake ke saath in sabhi kii jivan lila ko samaapt kar diya
 Seeing this, perhaps even the greatest abuser may tremble
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-9-car main dhamaake se udanachar kaidiyon ko iesas ke aatanki is tarah maut ke kareeb le gaye
 Hands tied gardan aatankiyon ne jakad main
 One by one, he was seated and tied in this car
 car ko baahar se lock kiya gaya
 They were left alone to travel from here to death
 phir ek aatanki ke haathon main nazar aayaa puri tarah se lod mortar launture
 Whose target was on the car
 ek ishaare ke baad mortar chali or sidhe is car main ja dhansi
 With a blast, the people sitting in the car flew away
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-10-suuli par lataka kar maaranasuuli par latakaane kii tasviren aatank ke samrajya se bahut ain
 But the way American spies were killed this year by Baghdadi terrorists, it is difficult to describe the generosity in words
 kasaai khaane main jis tarah jibha karne ke baad jaanavar ko latakaaya jaataa he
 Similarly, to hang these hostages, the terrorists first tied their hands and then they were dragged one by one to the place where death was given
 phir unhen ulataa lataka diya gaya
 In this way everyone was shocked by the dreadful death

 What RJD supremo Lalu Prasad went to jail, his friends are slowly starting to side with him
 ab jo sabase mahatvapurn hasti unka saath chhodti dikh rahi he wo hai ramvilas paswan
 The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) supremo is looking for a new destination these days
 darasal yah sab ramvilas paswan or lalu prasad ke putr-prem ke kaaran hi ho rahaa he
 Both are trying to secure the future of their sons and are working accordingly
 jab lalu prasad ne apane beton ke liye manch taiyaar kiya to algepi ne kuch nahin kaha lekin jab paswan ne apane bete chiraag paswan ko aage badhanaa shuru kiya to argedy naaraaz ho gai
 One of its leaders Javed Ansari called the LJP a treacherous party
 lalu ke khaas mitra raghuvansh prasad singh ne to yah bhi kaha ki argedy ko loksabhaa kii 40 siton par chunaav ladanaa chahie
 LJP took a dig at this
 bataaya jaataa he ki ramvilas paswan lok sabha chunaav main jedy (you) yaa congress ke saath jane kii sambhaavna par gaur kar rahe hai
 But RJD does not like this thing
 vah chaahati he ki pehle kii tarah hi algepi unke saath chunaav lade
 Chirag Paswan, chairman of the ljp's parliamentary board, said that if the situation turned out to be the opposite, we would contest all 40 seats alone
 chiraag paswan ne to yah bhi kaha ki unke paas itani takat he ki vah akele hi chunaav lard sakate hai
 Trusted sources said that Chirag is leaning towards the BJP and is keen to compromise with him
 dhyaan rahe ki ramvilas paswan ko endie ne mantri pad diya tha lekin congress ne koi pad nahin diya
 The father and son have a problem with this matter
 algepi ke bade netaa is samay is baat par ekamat nahin hai ki ve kiske saath chunaav laden

 The Kobe showroom of the rail car manufacturer Kawasaki Heavy Industries has photographs of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Modi, which were pulled during Modi's visit in November last year

 During Prime Minister Modi's visit in 2015, it was agreed to double Japan's direct investment in India as well as the number of Japanese companies operating in India by 2019

 The business cooperation of the two countries is now entering a new phase in the form of the mumbai-ahmedabad High Speed rail Project
 sitambar ke madhya main apni aagaamee bharat yatra ke dauraan japani pradhanmantri shinjo abe ke sabase pehle ahmedabad jane or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath haai speed rail pariyojna ke karmchaariyon ke liye khulne ja rahe prashikshan centre ke udghaatan samaaroh main video link ke jariye bhaag lene kii ummid he
 This center is to open in Vadodara
 is pariyojna se japan kii choti-badi tamaam companiyon main utsaah kaa maahaul he
 But there is one aspect that slightly cools this enthusiasm
 modi or abe ke bich tamaam sauhaard-garmjoshi or inke bich kii har baithak ke baad donon pakshon kii ore se kii gayi badi-badi ghoshnaaon ke baavjood adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki haai speed rail pariyojna kii vaastavik pragati dhimi he
 Japan officials say the initial issue of negotiations has been resolved and some companies have shown interest in developing a high-speed rail system in India on the lines of the Shinkansen system, yet many companies have been reluctant to join Huh

 Another cause for concern is that many major partnership agreements between Japanese and Indian companies were broken due to sudden and mutual differences
 bhartiya adhikariyon main bhi haai-speed rail ke prati kuch pratirodh-sa dikhataa he
 When it comes to this, they often siphon the amount spent on high-speed rail projects and railway safety
 unka kahana he ki 20 agast kii train durghatana main 23 yatriyon ke maare jane ke baad japan ke adhikari bhi chintit ho gaye hai
 They too have started worrying that the accident will once again spark the debate over the high-speed rail project versus railway safety costs
 naam jaahir na karne kii shart par ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘jab aapke pradhanmantri ne faisla kar liya he (pariyojna ko aage badhaane kaa) to phir baar-baar peeche jaakar bahes main padane kaa kya matlab?’’is saal june main japan kii kawasaki haivi industries ne steel metro coach ke nirmaan ke liye bharat haivi electricals ke saath takneekee sahyog kaa samjhauta kiya
 Right now there is discussion on how to transfer technology and impart training
 kawasaki ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki achaanak haai speed parivahan ke kshetra main kud padana uchit nahin lagata
 "we should start with passenger trains and metro," said an official of the rolling stock company of Kawasaki Heavy Industries
 uske baad ham haai speed railway par kaam karen
 We need time
 ise turant nahin kar sakate
 We have to train people, give them proper guidelines
 abhi hamane anubandh par hastakshar kiye hai or isapar charchaa kar rahe hai ki ise kaise karen
 "IHRA officials are also concerned with the Government of India focusing on only three points in this project — punctuality, Make in India and technology transfer
 ve kehete hai ki haai speed rail kaa sabase mahatvapurn pahalu iskaa nirmaan nahin balki durghatana se bachaav he
 The Shinkansen network, operating since 1964, has a proud safety record — not a single accident occurred in 53 years
 us samay japan ne express-ve network ke bajaay haai speed rail galiyare viksit kar apni gharelu arthvyavastha ko badhaava dene kaa ek sochaa-samajha faisla liya tha
 The Japanese take pride in their system for safety and reliability not only without reason
 unka hardware or software par utana hi dhyaan tha jisamen oparation, rakrakhaav, karmchaaree prashikshan ke alaava suraksha, thos prabandhan tathaa takneekee navachaar aadhaarit maansikta viksit karnaa shaamil tha
 Says an IHRA official, "only after putting all these aspects into practice, did we decide the way forward
 ham ise ‘total system approach’ ve kehete hai
 If one of these had been missed on a scale, it could not have created an amazing record of 53 years of operation without an accident
 ’’ ve kehete hai, ‘‘pehle haai speed rail banaaen, or phir ‘mek in india’ ke bare main sochen
 It seems that the entire emphasis of India is on 'make in India'
 ‘samay kii pabandi’ or ‘mek in india’ main santulan bananaa mushkil he
 This is an issue that needs to be resolved

 When Japan started its high-speed rail network, it did so through an aggressive privatization program
 sabase pehle 1987 main usne railway kaa nijeekaran kiya or phir use gyaarah choti-choti kshetreey rail companiyon main baanta
 Bala's political courage was needed to take this decision because it had caused a huge loss of jobs at that time

 The rail network proved to be a boon in the development of the suburbs, as it played an important role in reducing the burden of migrant population on the metros and making it an important center of trade on the railroad
 isane yatriyon kaa ek nayaa varg bhi taiyaar kiya jo sadak yaa hawaii maarg ke vikalp ke taur par railmarg chunane laga jisase donon network par dabaav kam ho gaya
 Additionally, the high-speed rail network with a maximum speed of around 320 kmph has also helped to bring towns and cities closer to each other

 However, it has also been seen that national interests often become secondary to local interests

 unhone kaha, ‘‘gujarat ko zyada raashi kaa bhugtan karnaa chahie kyonki uske paas 9 stesan hai

 un donon bike savaar vyaktiyon ne subut ke taur par sumita ko ek visiting card bhi dikhaaya or iske baad sumita ko kuch hosh nahin rahaa
 He got such an intoxication that he himself took away jewelry worth lakhs of rupees from his body and handed it over to the alleged policemen

 After some time, when he regained consciousness, he had fake jewelry in his hand instead of real jewelry
