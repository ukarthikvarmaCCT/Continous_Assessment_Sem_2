 He claimed that the reduced rate of GST on fertilizer will bring prosperity to the rural sector
 (input bhashaa se) (from input language) sachin tendulkar ne apane 100wein antarrashtriya shatak kii kavayad main rakshaatmak ballebaaji karke kai baar apana wicket ganvaaya he lekin is diggaj bhartiya kii ballebaaj austrailia ke khilaaf chauthe or antim test match main puure pravaah main ballebaaji karne kii sambhaavna he
 Tendulkar's fellow player said, "he is ready in such a way that he is not going to stop only on a century
" ek baar jab vah yah uplabdhi hasil kar lenge to us pari ko or aage badhaane kii koshish karenge
 Probably he will score a double century
 ’tendulkar abhi tak is daure main apane saathiyon kii tulana main kam asafal rahe hai
 He made 41 in six innings
 50 kii ausat se 249 ran banaaye hai
 But his wait for the great century continues to grow
 tendulkar is baat se waakif hai ki vah aksar kuch kaarnon se shatak ke kareeb pahunchakar out ho jate hai
 He has now made up his mind to bat in the final Test match with complete freedom from start to finish
 sidney main pehle test match main tendulkar ne 24 gend par 20 ran banaaye lekin unke agle 21 ran 65 gend par bane
 In the next innings, his initial eight runs were off 42 balls, but after that he changed his attitude and made the next 42 runs on 48 balls
 iske baad phir se unhen apane aakhri 20 ran banane ke liye 43 gend khelni padi
 Sometimes this happens due to falling wicket from the other end
 adhiktar baar aisa tab hua jabaki satr kaa aakhri yaa din ke antim kshanon kaa khel chal rahaa ho
 He has not failed but his way the team and he himself has been hurt
 nishchit taur par 100waan shatak tendulkar ke dimag main ghar kar gaya he pichley das test kii 19 pariyon se vah shatak nahin laga paye hai
 In his 187 Test match career, he never waited longer for a Test century
 isse pataa chalata he ki tendulkar bharat kii ekadivasiy team kaa hissaa banane ke liye kyon taiyaar hue jo agle maheene trikoniya shrinkhalaa main bhaag legi
 Australian captain Michael Clarke wants to see Tendulkar's century on TV
 matlab ki vah nahin chaahate ki tendulkar yah uplabdhi austrailian sarajameen par hasil karen lekin prayek bhartiya cricket premi kii dili khwaahish he ki tendulkar yah uplabdhi chauthe test match main hi hasil karen
 Australian coach Mickey Arthur also wants to see Tendulkar's 100th century but after the current tour
 ricard dekhen to tendulkar ne ab tak austrailia main 16 test match main chah shatak lagaaye hai or ab vah aakhri baar ek or shatak kii kaamana kar rahe hai

 Janata Dal (U) and bjp's alliance in Bihar has been broken for a full month, but even now BJP leaders are sitting on the post of government commissions and enjoying red light
 maje kii baat ye he ki bijepi puure jor se nitish sarkaar par hamale bhi bol rahi he
 But the BJP is also instructing its leaders in constitutional posts in the commission not to resign so that they too can be sacked like BJP ministers and the party gets the sympathy of the people
 rekha trivedi rajya mahila ayog main sadsy hai
 They do not see any effect of breaking the alliance
 ve roj kii tarah ayog kii daftar main main apana kaamkaaj kar rahi he
 Rekha says that she will not resign, if she wants to sack the government
 aisi soch rakhane vaali rekha trivedi akeli nahin hai, balki kai aise netaa hai ki ek taraf to sarkaar par hamale bol rahe hai to duusari taraf laal batti kaa sukh bhi le rahe hai or jise rajya mantriyon kaa darja praapt he
 These names are prominent among the leaders enjoying the red light - Sanjay Mayukh, Member Savarna commissionvimal Jain, Member Child Protection Commission Ramdev Prasad Yadav, Chairman Child Labor Commission, Babulal Tudu, Chairman Scheduled Tribe Commission, Sardar Charan Singh, Vice President Minority Commission, Yogendra Paswan, Vice Chairman Scheduled Caste Commission Kushwaha, Member State Women's Commission Chandramukhi, Devi Member State Women's Commission Rekha Trivedi, Sd Somewhere State Women Ayogmrityujny Singh, member farmers Ayoglalita Devi, member of Child Protection Ayogramji Hrisidev member mahadalit Ayoghalanki some people are willing to resign if came a directive from the party sitting in the waiting
 babu laal tudu anusuchit janajati ayog ke adhyaksh hai
 He says that no instructions have come from the party
 istipha dene kaa nirdesh aane par ve istipha de denge
 BJP is not ready for this at all
 party kaa maananaa he ki jaise mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne gathbandhan se alag hone ke baad turant bijepi cote ke 11 mantriyon ko barkhaast kiya tha, thik usee tarah se ayog main baithe logon ko barkhaast kare, taaki phir se dhokhebaaji kaa aarope laga sake
 Former BJP minister Giriraj Singh says that Nitish Kumar has taken morality away from him
 ve aniatik ho gayi hai
 If there was morality in the Chief Minister, then Nitish Kumar, who was sworn in as NDA CM, should resign
 nitish kumaar is par maun hai lekin unke mantri ayog main baithe bijepi ke netaaon ko barkhaast karne ke liye sarkaar par dabaav banaaye huye hai
 Bihar government minister Drs
 bhim singh ne kaha ki aniatik ve log hai
 Calls morality, but does not apply to himself
 ye to vesharmi kii had he ki sarkaar se baahar hone ke baad bhi vibhinn aayogon, nigamon or panelon main vibhinn padon par kabiz hai
 They should resign, otherwise the government will give them out by giving a neck passport
 bijepi ke alag hone ke baad janata dal (you) ke netaaon ki najar un padon par lagi he jo bijepi ke cote kaa tha chaahe wo mantri pad ho yaa phir ayog kaa
 This is the reason why there is a constant demand to sack them, but the BJP does not want to leave any chance of sympathy
 isliye yah intjaar he ki kab inhe barkhaast kiya jaye, halaki 26 july se shuru hone vaale monsoon satr ke baad is par nitish kumaar kuch na kuch faisla jarur le lenge

 As much as the public support was needed to thwart all the government's manipulations, the need was also to take the right decisions at the right time, and Anna's advisors played a huge role in this

 Yes, these are the names of Team Anna, which are strengthening Anna in the movement
 sabase pehle baat karte hai, kiran bedi kii
 Former IPS officer Kiran Bedi's name was associated with Anna Hazare against corruption
 kiran bedi ne anna ke andolan ko nayaa aayam de diya
 Kiran Bedi knows the administrative methods very well, recognizes every pulse of the police and that's why Kiran Bedi is leading the movement against corruption in the right direction
 jab tihaad jail ke baahar jab anna samarthakon ne bheed laga di, to unhone samarthakon ko apane dhang main samajhaayaa
 Anna's message to supporters, is getting support with energy Anna When she was arrested by Kiran Bedi, she was seen explaining to the policemen in Tihar too
 anna ke andolan kaa makasad saaf he, shanti ke saath gandhivadi tareeke se apni awaz ko buland karnaa or isamen kiran bedi kii ahm bhoomika he
 The manner in which Anna shook the government from Tihar Jail, tilted the administration of Tihar Jail, may be the advice of Kiran Bedi
 kiran bedi kaaphi pehle se samaaj seva kar rahi hai, navajyoti or india vijan naam kii do foundation bhi chalaati hai, jisamen garib tabake kii mahilaon, bacchon ko free shiksha, nashe jaisi buree laton ko chhudaane kaa ilaaj kiya jaataa he
 In 1972, Kiran Bedi became the first woman IPS officer, and even after retirement in 2007, she helps poor and destitute people through a website whose complaints are not heard by the police
 kiran bedi sanyukt eashtra ke shanti banaae rakhane vaale department kii salaahkaar bhi chuni gayi thi
 Today, Kiran Bedi, 62, along with 74-year-old Anna, is pushing hard to bring Lokpal bill against corruption today

 chhattisgarh main kareeb 1
 After announcing the merger of 80 lakh education workers as government teachers, the BJP government of the state has snatched a big issue from the hands of Congress
 badi sankhya main shikshakarmiyon ko sanvillian kaa tohfa dekar mukhyamantriraman sinhane apane vot bank ko majboot banaakar congress ke saamne badi chunauti khadi kar di he
 For the past 10 years, the demand for merger of education workers had become a sore throat for the government
 haalanki iske lierajyasarkaar ko do hajaar karod rupee se zyada kaa bajet kaa alag se praavdhaan karnaa hoga
 In fact, after the merger, the salary and allowances of education workers will increase by twenty to twenty-five percent
 yahi nahin ve kai sarkari suvidhaon ke hakdaar bhi ban jaaenge
 Legislative assembly elections are scheduled in the state after a few months
 lihaaja shikshakarmiyon ke sanvillian kaa faisla rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ke liye turup kaa patta sabit ho saktaa he
 The Congress has so far been able to straighten its political owl by supporting the education workers' movement, but this decision of Raman Singh has turned its hopes on
 barason puraani maang purilambe andolan or intjaar ke baad aakhirkaar shikshakarmiyon kii saalon puraani sanvillian kii maang chhattisgarh sarkaar ne puri kar di he
 More than one and a half lakh education workers of Chhattisgarh will directly benefit from it
 shesh junior shikshakarmi bhi sanvillian ke daayre main aaenge, lekin kab or kaise sarkaar ne iskaa khulaasa nahin kiya he
 According to the information received, all the education workers who have served more than eight years will be merged and made as government teachers
 isse shikshakarmiyon ke vetanbhatton main badhotaree to hogi hi, unhen kai sarkari suvidhaayen bhi muhaiyaa hogi
 Prior to the assembly elections, the merger of education workers is being seen as a trump card of the BJP government
 mukhyamantri raman singh ke mutabik jald hi cabinet kii baithak bulaakar shikshakarmiyon ko sarkari shikshak banaae jane kaa notification jari hoga
 Chief Minister Raman Singh has announced a merger of education workers from the stage in the presence of BJP National President Amit Shah during the Vikas Yatra in Ambikapur
 chunavi saal main chhattisgarh sarkaar ne shikshakarmiyon ke sanvillian kaa faisla lekar ek bada daanv khelaa he
 In the state for the past several months, education workers have been continuously demonstrating and carrying out many campaigns to demand their merger

 Which was also successful to a great extent

 Along with the selfie, he warned that if the merger is not done, half a dozen votes of each family will go to the account of the opposition parties
 sarkaar ke is faisle ko shikshakarmiyon ke baari dabaav ke kaaran liya gaya faisla mana ja rahaa he
 As soon as the announcement of the Sanvilion, the education workers across the state gathered at the square and squares and congratulated each other and celebrated

 wo aae or trek driver ko goli markar maukey se faraar ho gaye
 After this incident, all the promise-intent miscreants of Faridabad Police, who claimed to celebrate Independence Day with pomp and safety, were aired
 police ne agyaat badmaashon ke khilaaf maamla darj kar cese kii chaanbin shuru kar di he
 The conductor of the truck said that he and the driver were sitting in the truck at Bata Chowk when the miscreants knocked on the window on the conductor side and asked them to open the door
 iske baad driver ne darwaja kholane se manaa kar diya or trek ko start kar chalane lage tabhi badmaashon ne driver said vaali khidki kaa sheesha tod diya or trek driver ko goli maar di
 After this, the crooks escaped from the spot
 goli lagane ke baad conductor ne jaise-taise trek ko said lagaaya or bhaag kar kuch hi duuri par khadi police ko isaki soochna di
 After this, the police called an ambulance and sent the driver to the hospital
 vahiin, police ke mutabik unhen trek ke conductor nanhe ne ghatana kii soochna di
 On receiving the information, police immediately reached the spot and got the injured truck driver admitted to the civil hospital for treatment

 ab soshal media par ek video ke jariye daawa kiya gaya he ki mumbai ke chandivali se congress vidhayak naseem khan ne 'pakistan jindabad' ke naare lagaae
 In the viral video it can be seen that a person standing on the stage in a packed gathering is saying 'pakistan Zindabad'
 vyakti ye bhi kah rahaa he ki agar narendra modi or rajnath singh main himmat he to deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaakar dikhaae
 India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the video has been tampered with
 naseem khan ne 'pakistan jindabad' aadhyatmik guru shrishri ravishankar ke sandarbh main bolaa tha
 Shree Shree Ravi Shankar's part has been removed from the video
 Geetika swaminama kii ek twitor yujar ne is bhraamak video ko share kiya tha
 The tweet has received more than 500 likes and retweets till the news is written
 Geetika Swami kaa twit ab delit ho chukaa he
 Some people have also shared this video on Facebook

 a logo with 'mushaira Media' written on it can be seen in the video
 utyub par hamane Mushaira Media search kiya to is naam se ek utyub channel mila
 On searching the youtube channel, we found a video that contained a viral video
 ye video kisi sakinaka mushayara kaa he, jise june 2016 main aplod kiya gaya tha

 On 21 seconds, Nasim Khan is saying - 'I want to ask Modi ji that today Shree Shree Ravi Shankar in Delhi, on the banks of Yamuna, raised the slogan of Pakistan Zindabad, whether he will be tried for treason in the presence of Rajnath Singh
 agar himmat he modi ji ke andar, rajnath ne agar apni maa kaa doodh piya he to deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaa kar dikhaaen
 On seeing the original video, it became clear that Nasim Khan had said 'pakistan Zindabad' while referring to a statement of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
 bhram failaane ke liye video se shrishri ravishankar vaala hissaa hataa diya gaya he
 In fact, according to media reports, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar had announced Jai Hind and Pakistan Zindabad during the World Culture Festival held on the banks of Yamuna in Delhi in March 2016
 iske baad shrishri ne manshaa spasht karte hue kaha tha ki jai hind or pakistan jindabad kaa naaraa ek saath kyon nahin lagaaya ja saktaa? khabar ke mutabik, is dauraan manch par tatkaaleen grahamantri rajnath singh bhi maujuud the

 aamtaur par rishte main ladaai-jhagade ko galat mana jaataa he
 But it is natural for the relationship to be noisy or not agreed upon by the two partners
 aise main agar thodi bahut nok-jhonk hoti he to yah achche rishte kaa sanket he
 We are telling you 6 types of fights which are a sign of deep love
 rishte main kam ho rahi garmjoshi ko lekar-aksar hota he ki shuruyaat main ham apane partner ko samay dete hai, pyaar or sarprise dete hai
 But gradually these things become less and the relationship starts getting boring

 kai baar is par nok-jhonk hoti he
 This tip is necessary because you cannot run away from the responsibility that comes with the relationship

 You both fight
 lekin isamen kuch galat nahin he
 If your mind is to be alone for some time, then the partner's mind is to disturb you
 aisi nok-jhonk main aap aksar chintaa / dukh bhul jate hai
 If the mood is not quite right, then the partner should be left alone for a short time
 baad main aap unhen 'pareshaan' kar sakate hai
 Aloe vera is the treatment of obesity, but use it is very important in money-money relationship

 But sometimes the things that you find extravagant are necessary to the partner
 aise main nok-jhonk hoti he
 But the tip-off that can save some money is obviously a sign of a good relationship

 The disease caused bark-like creations on 26-year-old Abul's fingers, which gave him the name 'tree Man'
 haalanki ab unki surgery kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 According to the doctors, if the bark is removed from the surgery, then about 5 kg weight will be lost from their body
 bangladesh ke dakshini jile khulanaa ke rahane vaale abul kehete hai ki jab 10 saal pehle unki anguliyon par yah growth shuru hui thi, to unako nahin pataa tha ki yah is kadar bad jaaegi
 Gradually, he was unable to do any work
 ab unke donon haathon main darjanon 2-3 inch kii shakhaaen hai or pairon main bhi kuch choti-choti growth hai
 Abul initially tried to cut this growth on his own, but it was very painful
 tab unhone homeopathy or herbal dawaaen leen, lekin isse unki condishan or bighad gai
 He had also contacted doctors in India, but his family was unable to afford the treatment
 abul pehle rickshaw chalaane kaa kaam karte the, lekin is beemaari kii vajah se unhen yah kaam chhodana pad gaya
 Now he will be treated at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH), where only the hospital will bear the full cost of his treatment
 yah surgery is tarah kii jaaegi ki abul ke haathon kii nason ko koi nuksaan na ho
 The comments 4 saal pehle yah growth jab teji se badhani shuru hui to abule ne doctoron ko dikhaaya
 It was then revealed that he had succumbed to epidermodisplasia varusiformis
 yah ek bahut hi rer genetic skin disorder he, jisase prabhavit insaan main ped kii jadon or shakhaon kii tarah skin growth hone lagati he

 dhire-dhire vah koi bhi kaam karne main asamarth ho gaye
 He now has dozens of 2-3 inch branches in both his hands and also some small growths in his legs
 abul ne shuru main ne khud hi yah growth kaatane kii koshish kii, lekin yah bahut dardanaak tha
 He then took homeopathy and herbal medicines, but this worsened his condition
 unhone bharat ke doctoron se bhi sampark kiya tha, lekin unka parivaar ilaaj kaa kharch uthaane main asamarth tha
 Abul used to run a rickshaw earlier, but due to this disease, he had to leave this job
 ab dhaka medical college hospital (dmasiech) main unka ilaaj hoga, jahaan hospital hi unke ilaaj kaa puraa kharch uthayega
 This surgery will be done in such a way that there is no damage to the veins of Abul's hands

 The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday approved the Motor Vehicles (amendment) Bill-2019, with stricter provisions for road safety, to reduce road accidents in the country
 rajyasabha ne vidheyak ko charchaa ke baad 13 ke mukaable 108 maton se paarit kar diya
 The amendment proposals of the opposition members brought on the bill were soundly rejected

 Due to these amendments, now this bill will again go to the Lok Sabha

 Implementation of its provisions is dependent on the will of the states and the Center seeks to cooperate with the states, bring about radical changes in the transport system and reduce accidents
 vidheyak main sadak durghatnaon ko kam karne ke makasad se kaaphi kathor praavdhaan rakhe gayi hai
 Provided for stringent penalties for violation of rules such as driving by juvenile minors, driving without license, driving dangerously, driving drunk, driving faster than the prescribed limit and driving people over or exceeding the prescribed standards has gone

 The Bill envisages the formation of a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund for the Central Government, which will provide compulsory insurance cover to road users in India

 Replying to the discussion on the Bill, Gadkari said, "there will be no interference in the authority of the states
 jo rajya iske praavdhaanon ko lagu karnaa chaahate hai wo karen, jo nahin chaahate hai wo nahin karen
 Our stand will be to cooperate
 'gadakari ne kaha ki vaahanon kii kharid kii sthiti main uske panjikaran kaa kaam dealer ko dene se rajyon ko rajasav kaa koi nuksaan nahin hoga kyonki kar kaa paisa sidhaa rajya sarkaron ke khate main online paddati se jamaa kiya jayega
 States can also determine the tax rate in this regard

 He said that the government is trying to operate electric buses which will be very convenient for the common people with being affordable

 ise vishwa bank or asian vikaas bank kii madad se lagu kiya jaayegaa

 Gadkari said that under this, there is a plan to run a sky bus for the first time in the country
 paryaavaran hitaishi or sasti bas seva kii shuruyaat dilli ke dhaula kuna se haryana ke manesar tak chalaaye jane se hogi
 He clarified that road construction flaws are responsible for road accidents in the country
 iske liye unhone sadak banane vaali company or ejiniyaron kii javabdehi tay kii jaayegi
 Gadkari admitted that his only failure in the last five years as a minister was not to reduce road accidents
 unhone kaha ki tamaam prayaason ke baavjood vah sadak haadason main ummid ke mutabik kami nahin laa paae
 Tamil Nadu has done a very good job in this regard and we will follow it across the country

 sidney test main cheteshwar pujaara kii keemat par suresh raina ko mauka mila, lekin unhone sabase zyaada niraashaa kiya
 Raina failed to open his account in both innings of the Test
 unke test kariyar main yah doosraa mauka he, jab ve kisi test kii donon pariyon main khaataa nahin khol paae
 Earlier in August 2011, Suresh Raina was unable to open his account in both innings of the Oval Test played in England, although Suresh Raina's performance in the Oval Test was far better, because then he made a total of 42 balls to make zero in both innings
 Had to face, but in both innings of Sydney Test, Suresh Raina was dismissed for zero within just four balls
 pehali pari main to pehali hi gend par shen watson ne unhen pavilion bhej diya, vahiin duusari pari main ve teesri gend par elbeadblyoo out hue
 Among the top order batsmen in Indian cricket, Suresh Raina is the only other batsman who could not open an account in both innings twice in his career
 unase pehle mohinder amarnath bhi apane test kariyar main do baar donon pariyon main khaataa nahin khol paae the, lekin mohinder amarnath 69 test ke kariyar main do baar durbhagyapurna rahe, haalanki jab ve apane kariyar main duusari baar donon pariyon main khaataa nahin khol paae the, to vah unka 42waan test tha, lekin suresh raina mahaj 18 test main hi do baar kisi test kii donon pariyon main khaataa nahin khol paae hai
 Actually, Suresh Raina is becoming the second name of failure in Test matches in Indian cricket
 ek to 2005 se hi vanade team main niyamit taur par shaamil rahe suresh raina test maichon main ab tak apni jagah sunishchit nahin kar paae hai
 On the other hand, Virat Kohli, who has been in the team since 2008, has also become the captain of the Test team
 isaki sabase badi vajah australia ke khilaaf is series main bhi najar ai
 On the one hand, Virat Kohli hit 692 runs in eight innings of four Tests
 vahiin suresh raina ab tak apane kariyar main 18 test maichon kii 31 pariyon main mahaj 768 ran bana paae hai
 This is Suresh Raina's condition when he scored a strong century in the very first innings of his Test career
 srilanka ke khilaaf colombo main 2010 main khele gaye debyue test kii pehali pari main suresh raina ne 120 ran thoke the
 In the second innings of the career, 62 and in the third innings Raina not out 41 runs
 chauthi test pari main unhone 86 ran banaae the
 He scored zero for the first time in the fifth innings and after that Suresh Raina has been dismissed for zero eight times in reaching 31 Test innings
 jaahir he, 200 se zyada vanade khel chuke suresh raina kaa test kariyar shuru hone se pehle hi khatm hone kii raah par he or iske liye khud suresh raina ke alaava koi doosraa jimmedaar nahin he

 Pakistan's foreign minister has complained to India at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
 pakistan ne chitthee likh UNSC main kashmir mudda uthaaya or bharat kii shikaayat kii
 This letter from Pakistan against India in the UNSC came after the UNSC statement in which the UN Security Council condemned Pakistan after the terrorist attack in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne UNSC ko likhi chitthee main ek baar phir kashmir raag alapa he
 Qureshi flatly denied the Pakistan-sponsored terrorism charge, saying Pakistan wants peace
 kuraishi ne pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ke bhaashan kaa wo ansh UNSC se saajha kiya jisamen unhone kaha tha ki islamabad shanti chahta he, lekin bharat yuddh jaisi sthiti utpann karne par utaaru he
 The Pak Foreign Minister wrote to the UNSC President that shortly after the Pulwama attack, without any investigation or giving any evidence, India started accusing Pakistan and started making rhetoric against Pakistan
 kuraishi ne yah bhi likhaa ki bharat ne soshal media par share kiye ja rahe sandigdh video ko aadhaar banaakar pakistan par niraadhaar aarope lagaae
 At the same time, Pakistani Foreign Minister Qureshi told UNSC that Senior Minister of Government of India (nitin Gadkari) is using water as a weapon and is threatening
 unhone kaha ki lambey samay se chali aa rahi sindhu jal sandhi (IWT) ko sankat main daalane kii koshish kii ja rahi he

 (input bhashaa se) Have you heard about a battery that consumes sugar and gives energy to the smartphone for 10 days? This type of bio-battery is going to be a reality soon
 varjeenia tech ke naam se mashhoor varjeenia polytechnic and state uniwarsity ke anusandhankartaaon ne ek nai baio bydaree kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya he, jo bhaar ke anupaat main zyada sakasham he
 Its capacity is much higher than the lithium ion battery used in most electronic devices
 ek baio bydaree chini ko vidyut urja main badal sakati he
 It works just like our metabolism and decomposes the sugar into carbon dioxide and water, emitting electrons
 varjeenia tech main research karne vaale jhiguang jhu ne kaha, 'lithium aayan bydaree aapke phone main keval ek din kaam kar saktaa he
 In future, sugar will be used as fuel in it
 uske baad phone 10 dinon tak kaam karegaa
 'the new bio battery will convert sugar completely into energy, which means that it will have far more power than earlier bio batteries and will be able to charge more than common lithium ion batteries
 aath saal tak wo or uskaa puraa parivaar deshadrohi, aatankwaadi, kaatil or naa jane kin-kin tohamaton ke saath ghut-ghut kar jeeta rahaa
 What was won, you should say that you won and won while getting the punishment for staying alive
 kehane ko aath saal jail kii salaakhon ke peeche wo tanaha tha lekin hakeekat main to puraa parivaar hi kaid kaat rahaa tha
 Of course, the blame was only on his head and punishment for that one man alone
 par uski sajaa kii sajaa puraa ghar bhugat rahaa tha
 For eight years, his house saw all the colors and colors that could spoil anyone's life, in the guise of Tohmat, Jillat, Trouble, Tightness, Injustice, Pain and Tears
 ab wo bure din biit gaye hai, to kya un aath saalon ke achche din ab inhen koi lautaa saktaa he?akasar ye kaha jaataa he ki galat yaa bhatki hue raah par zyaadaatar wo log chalate hai jo padhe-likhe nahin hote
 Because it is believed that it is easy to mislead such people
 lekin physics or maths ke saath first class graduate mohammad vasif haidar ko jab 2001 main dilli police kii special cell ne giraftaar kiya tha to har koi chaunk uthaa
 It was said in the newspapers that for the first time such a educated terrorist has been arrested in the country
 america company main kaam karne vaale vasif haidar par bam blast, deshadroh or murder kaa iljaam tha
 Mohammad Wasif Haider's childhood was spent in Chamanganj, a small neighborhood in Kanpur city called Manchester of Asia
 bachapan se hi padhai-likhaai kaa shauk tha, shauk ko inaam bhi mila
 Asif got a good degree in science, Asif got a job in a multi national company
 ghar main maa-baap, bivi or teen choti-choti betiyon ke saath haidar ek khushhaal jindagi guzaar rahaa tha
 Everything was good, but only until that fateful night of July 30, 2001, had landed at her house
 ek raat ne hi haidar or uske puure ghar kii duniya badal kar rakh di
 After that night, dawn occurred many times but the dawn of Haider's life had become angry with him
 raat beeti to subah tak gharavaalon ko yahi pataa nahin tha ki unke bete ko koun uthaakar le gaya
 One day later, when Haider became the headline of the newspapers in Kanpur, the world as well as Hyder's family came to know that there was no other police to take Hyder
 ‘iesai ke teen agent chamanganj se giraftaar’darasal police ne haidar ke saath do or ladakon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 But till now the news was that all three are agents of Pakistani intelligence agency ISI
 giraftaar ke fouran baad haidar or uske saathiyon ko dilli laayaa gaya
 After this, Hyder arises even today just by remembering what happened for the next three days
 third degree ke naam par us par aise-aise julm dhaae gaye ki haidar tuutata chalaa gaya
 After his arrest, Haider was illegally kept in police custody for a full three days
 is dauraan usase naa sirf sade kagajaat par dastakhat karaae gaye
 Rather, through third degrees, forcible statements were taken from him on camera
 dilli police kii special cell ne police hiraasat main haidar kaa ikbaalia bayaan camere par record kiya tha
 However, Haider was picked up on the night of 30 July
 lekin dilli police ne use teen agast 2001 ko pehali baar adaalat main pesh kiya
 Later, in the charge sheet, the police showed the same statement of Haider to Judge Saheb as the most important evidence, which was forcibly called on camera in police custody
 chargeshit main police ne jo kahani taiyaar kii thi wo ye thi ki haidar ne kashmir main training lee thi or wo hijbul mujahiddeen ke liye kaam karata he
 Hyder was not arrested by the police alone
 teror modul ke naam par tab deshbhar se kul 23 logon ko uthaaya gaya tha
 Of these, three-four were Hyder's friends
 giraftaar ke baad haidar dilli kii tihaad jail, elahabaad ke naini jail or kanpur central jail main rahaa
 Hyder was kept completely isolated in the high security ward of the prison for the first four-five years
 yahaan tak ki shuruyaat main use gharavaalon se milane tak nahin diya gaya
 On the other hand, Hyder was in jail and the financial condition of the house here was constantly getting crispy
 maathe par aatankwaadi hone kii tohamat thi to paraye chhodie rishtedaaron tak ne saath chhod diya
 Even at such a time, there were some friends who did not leave Hyder
 ghar ke rashan se lekar haidar kii betiyon kii padhai ke kharch kii jimmedaari un doston ne hi uthaai
 Friends paid friendship
 magar baap ke maathe par laga aatankwaadi kaa thappa peechha nahin chhod rahaa tha
 Hyder's daughters got admission in the school, but those girls were also taunted
 skool main unka koi dost nahin ban paaya
 Everyone used to stay away from them
 kya id-bakreed, kya shaadi-byaah
 All happiness had passed away from Hyder's house
 skool ke varshikotsav main haidar kii betiyaan sirf isliye hissaa nahin le pain kyonki aath sau rupee kaa dress kharidne ke liye unke paas paise nahin the or wo apane abbu ke doston par or boj nahin daalana chaahati thim
 He had three daughters when Hyder went to jail
 sabase badi paanch saal kii duusari chaar saal kii or teesri dedh saal kii
 Time was passing
 udhar jail main haidar kii jindagi ghat rahi thi or idhar ghar main betiyon kii umr bad rahi thi
 With time, the book of crimes against Haider also increased
 ab haidar par deshadroh ke teen, 11 dhamaake, ediem kaa murder or 65 kilo ardex kii baramadi ke silsile main mukademe kii karrwai shuru hoti he
 Wasif Haider started studying law books while in jail
 haidar ko laga ki uske cese kii pairvi usase behatar koi or nahin kar saktaa
 So after reading the legal book, he started helping his lawyer in the case
 haidar or uske vakil kii mehnat ne rang dikhaanaa shuru kar diya
 All the accusations of Haider's head bang were turned out to be false
 police ke apane gavaahon ne police ke khilaaf gavaahi de di
 Haider's relationship with the terrorist organization could not be proved
 haidar ke khilaaf police ne jo sabase bada ilzaam lagaaya tha wo tha uske paas se 65 kilo ardex kii baramadagi
 But look amazing that the police could never show that 65 kg RDX court
 aatankwaad ke saare maamle se ab vasif bari ho chukaa tha
 Only one Kanpur ADM murder case was left
 darasal kanpur main 17 march 2000 ko danga hua tha
 During that riot, ADM City was shot dead
 golibari main ediem kaa ek sahaayak bhi ghayal ho gaya tha
 Wasif Haider was arrested by the police as a rioter in this case
 lekin baad main adaalat main usee ediem ke sahaayak ne bayaan diya ki goli chalaane vaala vasif haidar nahin tha
 Therefore, Wasif was acquitted in this case also
 ab wo ek aaazaad hindustani tha
 Wasif reached his home on the night of August 12, 2009, three days before Independence Day after spending eight long years in jail
 gharavaalon ko usne apane aane kii khabar nahin di thi
 After Haider's return home, his daughters now say to Fakhr that i too have Abba
 aath saal se jo khushiyaan is ghar se dur thim wo ab waapas laut ai hai
 Hyder also has a complaint with the media
 haidar kii maane to wo media hi he jisaki vajah se rihaai ke baad bhi wo berozegaar he
 But despite the acquittal from the court, the condition of Hyder's house still has not changed
 use shaayad samaaj ne ab bhi nahin aapanaaya
 He does not have a job
 desh kii police ne vasif haidar ko aatankwaadi banaaya tha or desh ke kanoon ne use begunaah bataaya
 The case should have ended but it did not happen
 kanoonee kaagajon main beshak uske naam ke aage se aatankwaadi shabd hat gaya ho
 But our society and the people of the society are yet to be removed from the mind
 lihaaza adaalat se rihaai ke baad bhi haidar lard rahaa he
 i fought today
 It was a lot of fun
 It was a toy for many days
 Wherever i sit, laugh, smile, no matter where i am
 Inside, legs, legs, heart, heart, heart, lips, lips, i have known how long i have been in this city, but no one cried, nor cried, nor shouted May include the fighting today enjoyed Ussebra kanoonee jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki marcides hit and ran maamle main kishor aaropee ke khilaaf vayask ke rup main sunwaayee honi chahie yaa nahin, is sawaal par faisla karne main kishor nyaay board (jejebi) sakasham he
 Four days after the accident, the juvenile accused had turned 18
 varisht adhivaktaa keties tulsi ne samachar agency bhashaa ko bataaya ki kishor nyaay (bacchon kii dekhbhaal evam sangrakshan kanoon 2015) ek janvari 2016 se lagu ho gaya he
 In such a case, the JJB should decide on whether the juvenile driver should be heard as an adult or not
 kanoonee prakriya ke bare main bataate hue unhone kaha ki kishor ke khilaaf vayask ke rup main sunwaayee ke liye board is baat par praathmik akalan karegaa ki aparaadh jaghanya prakruti kaa tha yaa nahin
 Whether or not the accused had a level of understanding and adulthood

 input IANS The first person who reached the spot after the helicopter crash of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was neither the police nor any administrative officer
 
 
 vahaan sabase pehle pahunchaa tha irfan, jisane behad chaturaai se zamin main dhans chuke helicopter se mukhyamantri ko baahar aane main madad kii
 
 
 The helipad was built near the shop of Irfan Sheikh, a junk businessman in Nilanga
 
 
 guuruuvaar ko sthaneey daura khatm kar jab mukhyamantri ne nilanga se latur ke liye udaan bhari, to irfan apni dukaan ke paas se hi utsukathavash unke udate helicopter ko nihaar rahaa tha, kyonki nilanga jaise chote-se gaanv main kisi helicopter kaa aana aakarshan kaa vishay hoga hi
 
 
 But, suddenly the atmosphere changed
 
 
 irfan ne apni ankhon ke saamne helicopter ko zamin kii taraf aate dekha or baad main behad oonchi awaz bhi suni, jiske baad vah usee disha main daud padaa, jabaki baaki log ghoomte pankhe or udati dhul se bachane ke liye ulat disha main bhaag rahe the
 
 
 Arriving on the occasion, Irfan tried to open the door of the helicopter from Tapak
 
 
 mukhyamantri fadanvis ne bheetar se irfan ko ishaara kiya or phir vah andar se lock kholkar darvaaze se nikle
 
 
 In fact, coming towards the ground was touched by the electric wires of the helicopter, and then fell down on the ground and fell, so the challenge was felt in opening the door
 
 
 irfan kii madad se mukhyamantri baahar nikal sake, or unhone baahar aate hi irfan se kaha ki vah surakshit hai, or irfan baaki fanse hue logon ko nikaalen
 
 
 The comments NDTV india se baatcheet main irfan ne bataaya ki iske baad vah andar fanse logon ko nikaalane main jute gaye
 
 
 The chief minister also came out and talked to Irfan and stopped a few feet away from the helicopter and the rest of the passengers, the pilot, were seen getting fired
 
 
 kuch hi pal ke baad prashasnic amala mukhyamantri kii madad ke liye pahunch gaya tha, or unhen gherkar haadase kii jagah se dur le gaya
 
 
 When NDTV India questioned Irfan as to why he had run towards the helicopter in the opposite direction from the rest, his reply was, "our king was trapped inside
" 
 
 " yah puche jane par ki kya vah ab CM se milanaa chaahate hai, irfan ne kaha, " nahin ji, hamaara raja batch gaya, yahi mere liye kaaphi he
 
 
 "this incident has also been confirmed from the Chief Minister's office
 
 
 nilanga main kabad kaa kaarobaar karne vaale irfan shaikh kii dukaan ke paas hi helipad bana tha
 
 
 Ending the local tour on Thursday, when the Chief Minister flew from Nilanga to Latur, Irfan was eagerly eyeing his flying helicopter from near his shop, because the arrival of a helicopter in a small village like Nilanga would be an attraction
 Only
 
 
 lekin, achaanak hi maahaul badal gaya
 
 
 Irrfan saw the helicopter coming towards the ground in front of his eyes and later also heard a very loud sound, after which he ran in the same direction, while the others were running in the opposite direction to avoid the fan and the flying dust
 
 
 mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunchakar irfan ne tapaak se helicopter kaa darwaja kholane kii koshish kii
 
 
 Chief Minister Fadnavis gestured to Irfan from within and then he opened the lock from inside and exited the door
 
 
 darasal, zamin kii taraf aate hue helicopter ke bijli kii taron se chhu gaya tha, or phir dhadaam se zamin par girakar dhans gaya tha, so, aise main daravaaza kholane main chunauti mahasoos ho rahi thi
 
 
 With the help of Irfan, the Chief Minister was able to get out, and as soon as he came out, he told Irfan that he was safe, and Irfan evacuate the other stranded people
 
 
 tippaniyan In a conversation with NDTV India, Irfan said that after this, he started evacuating people trapped inside
 
 
 mukhyamantri bhi baahar aakar irfan se baat karne ke baad helicopter se chand foot duuri par jaakar ruk gaye or baaki yatriyon, payalat ko baahar nikaale janaa dekhne lage
 
 
 After a few moments the administrative staff reached out to the Chief Minister's help, and surrounded them and took them away from the place of the accident
 
 
 jab NDTV india ne irfan se sawaal kiya ki vah baakiyon se ulat disha main helicopter kii ore kyon daude the, to unka jawaab tha, "hamaara raja andar fansaa tha
 
 
 "asked if he wants to meet CM now, Irrfan said," No, our king survived, that's enough for me
 
 
 " is is ghatana kii mukhyamantri karyaalay se bhi pushti kii gai he
 
 
 But, suddenly the atmosphere changed
 
 
 irfan ne apni ankhon ke saamne helicopter ko zamin kii taraf aate dekha or baad main behad oonchi awaz bhi suni, jiske baad vah usee disha main daud padaa, jabaki baaki log ghoomte pankhe or udati dhul se bachane ke liye ulat disha main bhaag rahe the

 This is stated in the soon-to-be-released autobiography of late Congress leader Arjun Singh, 'A grain of sand in the Haverglass of time'
 singh ne kaha ki sonia gandhi ko adhyaksh banaaye jane ke suzav par raav kii pratikriya sunakar unka ‘raajnneeti ke vibhats’ chehre se saamana hua
 The 383-page book is published by Hay House India and co-authored by Ashok Chopra
 chopra ne kaha ki singh kaa chaar march ko nidhan ho gaya tha or us samay vah apni aatmakatha ko likh hi rahe the
 Chopra said that he has tried to write with full credibility the things he could not write by interacting with Singh's family members, other friends and colleagues
 singh ne kaha ki hamaare suzav ko sunakar raav kuch der ke liye chup rahe, is dauraan unka cheharaa kaaphi gambhir lag rahaa tha
 He said, 'suddenly it rained with anger and almost shouted that it is necessary that the Congress should be taken as a train where coaches have to be connected to an engine of Nehru Gandhi family or there are other options? i was shocked to hear Rao's reaction but kept quiet
 ’singh ne kaha ki us samay ke eisisi ke koshadhyaksh sita ram kesari ne is maamle ko aage badhaayaa or jor dekar kaha ki yadi ‘ham congress adhyaksh kaa yah pad sonia ko dene kaa prastaav dete hai to yah thik hoga
 The book claimed that Rao felt that he had spoken too much too soon and had clearly exposed his anti-nehru sentiment
 uske baad unhone vichaarmagn dhang se sawaal kiya, ‘is suzav ko dene main koi nuksaan nahin he lekin kya vah sweekaar karengi? hamaare paas unke sawaal kaa jawaab nahin tha kyonki hamen sonia gandhi se adhyaksh banane ke liye kahana hoga or unki pratikriya lenaa hoga
 In this regard, Singh said that he first told Congress leaders Vicente George, ML Fotedar and Kesari himself
 arjuna ne kaha ki kesari unke ummidavaar ke vikalp se aashcharyachakit nahin the or sonia ko samarthan dene par sahmati jataai
 Arjun said in his book 'controversial demolition in Ayodhya and its impact' section that after the news of the demolition of Babri Masjid, the then Prime Minister locked himself in his room and the scene looked like when Nero was playing the flute when Rome was burning
 singh ne apni kitaab main kaha ki unhone dhaancha giraaye jane par baat karne ke liye chah disambar, 1992 ko dopaher main pradhanmantri awaas par phone kiya to ‘mujhe kaha gaya ki vah kisi se baat nahin karenge
 'he said,' i asked the answering person if he was out of Delhi? To this he said that he is in Delhi but he has locked himself in a room and has been told not to bother him under any circumstances
 ’arjuna singh us samay punjab ke muktsar main the
 Arjun Singh said, 'I think the scene was the same as Nero playing the flute during the burning of Rome
 maine apane mejabaan se anumati lee or tatkaal dilli ke liye ravaanaa ho gaya
 'he said that as soon as i got the news, pictures started to fall in my brain
 arjuna ne kaha, ‘maine mahasoos kiya ki is ghatana ke dukhad parinaam kii desh ke itihaas main gananaa nahin kii ja sakati
 Singh said, 'india's secular image suffered severe damage
 ’singh ne kaha ki chah disambar 1992 ko dhaancha giraaye jane ke ek din pehle unhone raav se kaha tha ki masjid ko giraaya ja saktaa he lekin unke ravaiye se aisa laga ki jaise ‘vah puure maamle ko gambhirtha se nahin le rahe hai
 ' aaj ravivaar ko saal kaa pehla surya grahan lagane vaala he
 This solar eclipse will start at 5:40 in the evening and will last for 10:01 minutes of the night
 yah bharat main aanshik rup se dikhaai degaa
 Whereas in South America, South Africa, Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean it can be seen in full
 bataa den suryagrahan ek khagoleey ghatana he, or ye ghatana tabhi hoti he jab chandramaa surya or prithvi ke bich se gujarata he
 There are some works mentioned in the scripture that should not be done at the time of eclipse
 agar aapane ye kaam kien to aapako kai pareshaaniyon se guzarana pad saktaa he
 Know what should not be done at the time of eclipse
 jisase ham kai pareshaaniyon se batch sakate hai
 - Do not massage the body with oil at the time of eclipse
 mana jaataa he ki surya grahan ke samay tel se maalish karne se twachaa sambandhi rog hote hai
 - Pregnant women need to take special care at the time of eclipse
 grahan ke samay unhen ghar se baahar nahin nikalnaa chahie
 They should chant the name of God so that there is no ill effect on the baby growing in the womb
 -jab grahan laga ho us samay kisi bhagwaan kii pratimaa ko nahin choona chahie
 Also, sleeping, cooking and eating etc
 should not be done
 -pati-patni ko grahan ke samay kamkrida se dur rahanaa chahie
 It is believed in the scriptures that at this time the child born due to conception indulges in evil
 -jab grahan lagata he to usase pehle bhojan kar len
 After that, add Durwa or Tulsi leaves to milk, curd and food items
 aisa karne se khaane kii vastuon main grahan kaa asar nahin padataa
 After the eclipse is over, clean the house and bathe yourself too
 uske baad zaruratmandon ko daan dena chahie
 Now Modi government will give maternity benefit only for the first child! - Bhajan-kirtan, chanting of Guru Mantra, worshiping etc
 should be done at the time of eclipse
 isse aadhyatm bal miltaa he or grahan kaa asar kam hota he
 But keep in mind that do not worship the idol
 bharat main kab se kab tak dikhegaa graharavivaar ko 5 bajkar 40 minute se shuru hone vaale surya grahan ko bharat main ashink rup se pehali baar shaam 6 bajkar 45 minute par hi dekha ja sakegaa
 The solar eclipse will be in its maximum state at 8:28 in the night, but it is night time in India, so it will not be visible here
 suraj kii aisi khagoleey sthiti maatr 1 minute 22 second hi rahegi
 The solar eclipse will end completely at 01:10 pm
 vaigyanik manyatasoorya grahan ke dauraan prithvi ke uttari evam dakshini dhruv prabhavit hote hai
 Hence this period is considered negative
 surya se ultrawoilet kirane nikalati hai, jo anzime system ko prabhavit karti hai, isliye suryagrahan ke dauraan saavdhaanee baratane kii jarurat he
 Sun Eclipse should not be seen with naked eyes
 Eclipse sunrise should never be seen with naked eyes
 isko dekhne ke liye vaigyanik pramanit telistcope kaa hi istemaal karnaa chahie
 Glasses that have the ability to stop ultraviolet rays can also be used to view solar eclipses
 is saal chaar grahabtaa den ki is saal aasmaan main hamen aise hi chaar grahan dekhne ko milenge
 The first partial solar eclipse of the year will be seen on 26 February 2017 in India i

 Obama has mentioned his many weeks of travel to Pakistan at various events, but he never visited Pakistan after becoming President

 'gauratlab he kiwan rank, van pensionke lagu hone main deree ko lekar purv sainikon ne rashtriya rajdhani samet deshbhar main anek jagahon par pradarshan kiye hai or ise tatkaal lagu karne kii maang kii
 Ex-servicemen have warned of going on a gradual hunger strike from Monday
 parrikar ne rashtriya suraksha ke bare main chintaaon par dhyaan dete hue aatankwaad ke krityon ko katai bardaasht nahin karne kii baat bhi kahi
 He did not tolerate negligence in national security, he said, 'you may fall a glass, but you do not drop a child because you take complete caution and this is the thinking
 jis din aap faisla le lenge ki gilaas ko girane nahin dena to aap ise kabhi nahin giraayenge
 In matters related to national security, the tendency to not tolerate at all is the only solution and this should be the thinking
 'manipur main kuch din pehle ghaat lagaakar kiye gaye hamale ke baad myanmar mencymapar sena kii karrwaika paroksh rup se zikr karte hue raksha mantri ne kaha, 'ek haalia ghatana ne rashtriya suraksha kaa paridrishy badal diya or logon kii soch main badlaav dikhaai de rahaa he
 Parrikar said that national security could be endangered due to internal hurdles
 unhone kaha ki bahari muddon se bhi rashtriya suraksha ko khatra ho saktaa he jaisaa ki 1971 main bangladesh mukti sangram ke dauraan hua jab us desh ke log narsanhaar se bachane ke liye bharat main aa gaye the
 Cybercrime is a big challenge, but the cybercrime is a new challenge for the defense forces
 unhone kaha, 'agar koi sibar hamalaa hota he yaa sibar aatankwaad hota he to seemaa par khatra ho saktaa he yaa yah jang main tabdeel ho saktaa he
 However, he dismissed the possibility of any security threat due to hacking of defense websites as all important information is cloud based and completely safe from such intrusions
 parrikar ne jaali mudra kii samasya or aarthik aatankwaad ko sibar hamalon se bhi zyada khatarnaak bataaya

 Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has approved the no-confidence motion brought by the opposition against the Modi government in the Lok Sabha
 avishvaas prastaav par shuukravaar ko charchaa ke baad voting hogi
 But the Congress seems divided over the timing of this proposal
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar avishvaas prastaav kii timming ke paksh main congress ke ek dhade kaa maananaa he ki yadi yah modi sarkaar kaa antim sansadeey satr hua to vipaksh is maukey se chook jayega ki sarkaar bina avishvaas prastaav ke kaarykaal puri nahin kar pai
 It believes that it should remain on record that a motion of no confidence came against the current government
 is tark ke peeche manshaa he ki bahes kii media kawarej se modi sarkaar ke khilaaf mudhon ko janata ke bich le jane kaa mauka milegaa
 At the same time, the opposition will gather together
 duusari taraf pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi apane sahyogiyon or baaki dalon ko manaane ke liye jaddojahad karnaa padegaa
 While a section of the Congress opposing the timing of the no-confidence motion believes that the opposition has come under the trap of the Modi government
 naam na chhapane kii shart par ek varisht congress netaa ne aaj tak se kaha he ki shuukravaar shaam ko prastaav par voting se pehle pradhanmantri modi apana bhaashan loksabhaa main denge
 saturday-sunday will be dominated by the media due to the weekend and the BJP may be able to create a narrative through it
 ise padhein: modi sarkaar kii pehali agnipariksha, avishvaas prastaav par shuukravaar ko hogi charchacongress ke is dhade maananaa he ki sansad satr ke pehle hafte hi pradhanmantri modi ko manch dekar galati kii gai
 Because of the consensus on the no-confidence motion, on the first day in the House, the government was able to pass many of its bills
 agar is prastaav par sahmati jataani bhi thi to satr ke antim dinon main jataani thi
 Perhaps the opposition did not expect the government to accept the no-confidence motion on the first day itself
 gauratlab he ki bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish deepak mishra ke khilaaf vipaksh dwaara laae gaye mahabhiyog par bhi na sirf kangras balki vipakshi dalon me bhi matbhed saamne aae the
 When many senior opposition mps did not sign the proposal
 vipaksh dwaara laae gaye mahabhiyog ko aparashtrapati or rajya sabha ke sabhapati venkaiya naidu ne asvikaar kar diya tha
 At the same time, BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi also got an opportunity to accuse the opposition of taking revenge action and to influence and intimidate the justice of the country

 com / zcc21v25j2 Mr
 Prime Minister, aap misses rekha lagad ko nahin jaanate honge
 i did not even know that she lives in my own society
 misses lagad pichley kuch maheenon se mujhe phone karne lageen
 Had not spoken properly, she also came home
 is dauraan main unase kiye apane vaade par khara nahin utraa or kaam kii vyastata main kho gaya
 Mrs
 Lagad did not forget her motive
 hamaari sosayadi main wo akeli rahati hai phir bhi enditivi ke daftar gayi
 Called several times because she did not want to hurt me
 vahaan se jo pataa chalaa uske hisaab se apane makasad par kaam karne lageen
 Just like you have set a motive for the cleanliness campaign, Mrs Lagad wants to do something for that campaign
 kal shaam misses lagad phir mere ghar ain
 He had some checks in his hand
 darvaaze par hi meri patni se kehane lageen ki ye raveesh ko de dena
 i was a short distance away from Mrs
 Lagad
 kaha ki haa mujhe de dijie
 Hearing the voice said that hey you are here
 maaf karnaa mujhe dikhaai nahin diya
 i am a little shocked that you have not seen everything right
 haa haa sab thik he, bas motiyobind ke oparation ke kaaran abhi kuch dhundhala sa dikh rahaa he isliye aapako nahin dekh saki
 Saying this, he held the envelope
 unke jate hi maine lifaafaa kholaa to hairaan rah gaya
 i wish this envelope would reach you directly
 aap zarur unhen phone kar dete ki maine bhi nahin sochaa tha ki yah abhiyaan logon kaa is tarah makasad ban jayega
 Actually, many people would have come to your office carrying checks worth thousands, millions and crores
 ve shaayad taqatvar log honge yaa itane to sakasham honge hi ki unke liye kuch karod kaa intazaam karnaa badi baat nahin hogi
 They may also want to be close to you on the pretext, but we journalists have a habit of suspecting them first
 yahi aadat hamen thik bhi rakhti he
 But where will old women like Mrs
 Lagad reach you
 unka chalanaa bhi itnaa sanbhal kar hota he ki ab shaayad wo takat nahin rahi ki itani zahamat uthaa saken
 But the purpose of doing something for the country still remains
 aap soch rahe honge ki in das check main jamaa raashi bahut badi hogi
 Actually it is not about the zodiac
 par haa bataa dene se aapke abhiyaan kii ahmiyat zarur bad jaati he
 Before that, let me also say my point
 yah acha abhiyaan he lekin jitna hona chahie utana ho nahin rahaa he
 Delegates have opted out of this after the initial activism
 wo bhi maan chuke hai ki yah kisi agyaat or adrishy system kaa kaam he
 Dirt reigns
 logon kii bhagidaari kamazor pad chuki he or is abhiyaan ko jari rakhane kaa system ban nahin paaya he
 You may be thinking about this and will be doing something
 misses lagad kaa diya hua lifaafaa yaad dilaane ke liye kaaphi he ki ise na bikharane dene kii zimmedaari bhi aapaki hi he
 Now it is my duty to tell the Prime Minister of India the names of those women, who do not know from what savings they have saved so much for you
 priti pruthi, smita priyadarshini, sharada dingle, chitralekha khemka, aruna singh, soni aacharya, bhaavana wantu, apaara pandey, nandita kumaar
 The amount is not very big but i am depositing this check for a total of nine thousand rupees in the cleanliness drive of NDTV
 ye saare check charitis and foundation ke naam se he
 i also asked for which camp you want to give
 dhimi or vinamr awaz main unhone kaha ki ham sab swatchta abhiyaan ke liye kuch karnaa chaahate hai
 You will give for the same campaign
 ummid he aapkaa yah abhiyaan sakriy rup se chal rahaa hoga
 Stepping out of the world of advertisements and hoardings must have made a place in the systems and people's imaginations
 is abhiyaan kaa khyaal rakhiyegaa
 The letter is long gone, sorry for that

 centre sarkaar dwaara agadi jatiyon ke garib logon ke liye jab se 10 pratishat ke aarakshan ke praavdhaan ke liye samvidhan main sanshodhan kiya gaya he, bihar kii raajnneeti main yaa aap kah sakate hai ki jatigat raajnneeti main ek baar phir ubaal aa gaya
 The leaders of the two major parties of the state, the ruling Janata Dal United (JDU) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), whatever the program may be, but do not forget to put forth their efforts on the issue of reservation, the steps taken in that direction and their views in the present context
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhale hi yah qadam loksabhaa chunaavon main agadi jati ke logon kaa kopbhaajan na hona pade iske maddenzar uthaaya ho lekin dharaatal par sachai yahi he ki is qadam ke baad pichhadi jatiyon or dalit samudaay main ek asantosh kii bhaavana upji he or bihar main rajd or jediu donon apane-apane tareeqe se ise bhunaane kii koshish main lage hai
 Where the Rashtriya Janata Dal, which has been aggressive on this issue from Parliament to the road since day one, is trying to get the non-yadav backward and most backward castes to be linked once again with their traditional vote bank
 vahiin jediu jo thodaa phoonk-phoonk kar bol rahi he
 It is his every effort to highlight the past history of the RJD and at least suffer the harm and keep his voters covered
 yahi ek kaaran he ki nitish kumaar jinhen shaayad bhaajapa ke kendriya netritv ne is mudde par bharose main nahin liya, unhone pratikriya dene main koi jaldbaazi nahin dikhaayi
 Nitish Kumar's party supported the constitutional amendment but did not get immediate response to this step
 jab unhone munh kholaa to swaagat kiya kyonki pichhadi jatiyon or anusuchit jati or janajati ke vartmaan 50 pratishat ke aarakshan ke saath koi chhedchhad nahin kii gai thi or ye alag 10% kaa aarakshan kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya tha
 But at the same time he also supported the demand to increase the reservation according to the population of backward castes
 nitish ne saafe-saafe iskaa vyaavhaarik samaadhaan bhi bataaya ki agali janaganana jo 2021 main hone vaali he, uske saath-saath jatigat janaganana bhi ho jaae to uske aankadon ke aadhaar par vartmaan aarakshan ke praavdhaan ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Nitish also knows that there is no cheer among the backward castes and Dalits, but his effort is to make the RJD hijack this agenda
 isliye nitish apni har sabha main purv mukhyamantri swargeey karpuri thakur ke jamaane main jo aarakshan vyavastha lagu kii gai thi, jisamen pichhadaa or ati pichhadaa ko bich vargeekrut kar ati pichhadon ko zyaada aarakshan kaa laabh diya gaya, usamen apni bhoomika kii charchaa karte hai
 At the same time, after the Mandal Commission was implemented in the whole country, how he had strongly opposed the then Chief Minister Lalu Yadav's efforts to implement the Mandal Commission by abolishing the reservation issued by Karpoori Thakur, also elaborately discusses it
 
 nitish ke saath ek bada adwantage yah he ki unhone bihar main satta sambhalate hi panchayaton main atipichhadon ko 20 pratishat aarakshan diya or ek vistrut surveykshan bhi karaayaa tha
 However, Nitish never cited the provisions of the 3% reservation provided to the poor of the upper castes in Karpoori Thakur formula and which was abolished by Lalu Yadav, citing constitutional provisions, but in the matter of reservation, Nitish would Opponents dominate
 vahiin rashtriya janata dal ne kendriya cabinet ke faisale ke saath hi virodh shuru kar diya tha
 RJD said that 'we are not opposed to reservation of the poor of upper castes, but at the same time if you are giving 10 percent reservation to 15% of the population, then the percentage of OBC castes is 56 percent, then their reservation for them is also the population
 Must be proportioned to
 rajd netaaon ne na keval loksabhaa or rajyasabha main iskaa jamkar virodh kiya balki bihar main vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav is mudde par har din agar saarvajanik manch se nahin to soshal media se sarkaar se sawaal zarur poochhate hai
 The RJD knows that after this step, if they leave some old leaders of their upper caste, be it the Lok Sabha elections or the Assembly elections, they have been getting votes from the forward castes
 lekin unka ye anumaan he yaa kahen ati aatmavishvaas ki rajya main 90 ke dashak ke samaan ek baar phir se pichhadi jatiyon ke matadaata golband honge or muslim-dalit ke saath hi ek bahut hi bada boat bank hoga
 But till now, such support or mobilization is happening on the ground in favor of RJD leaders, there is not much example of this
 lekin unka daawa he ki feedback ke anusaar is mudde par gramin ilaakon main kaafii asantosh he
 But it will be converted into votes because there is doubt as Nitish Kumar also has a strong hold in the backward castes and non-yadav backward castes
 vahiin bhartiya janata party jo is mudde par kuch zyaada hi utsahit he wo is baat ko lekaa raahat kii saans le rahi he ki kam se kam ab unhen madhya pradesh, rajasthan kii tarah agadi jatiyon ke asantosh kaa saamana nahin karnaa padegaa
 He will not have to do any manhandling in the election and he can easily cross the Lok Sabha elections by citing the track record of Nitish Kumar on the issue of reservation
 BJP ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki abhi haal main bhi jin bhi channelon kaa surveykshan aayaa he usamen NDA ko baari badhat hasil he
 It is clear that the dissatisfaction the RJD is talking about on this issue among backward and Dalits is like shooting an arrow in the air
 haa wo ek baat zarur maanate hai ki agar nitish bihar main gathbandhan kii aguwai nahin kar rahe hote or mahagathbandhan main hote to BJP ko aarakshan ke mudde par is qadam ke baad 1-2 siten bhi milanaa mushkil tha
 But the leaders of the NDA are suspicious that if the Supreme Court has given any comment or decision on this issue in the next two-three months or in the midst of the elections against this constitutional amendment, then it is a dice of reservation It may also reverse
 isliye bihar BJP ke varisht netaa or up mukhyamantri susheel modi abhi se kah rahe hai ki jis jatigat aarakshan kii baat nitish kumaar ne uthaayi he wo agali janaganana main zarur hoga
 As well as the question of the roster of reservation related to the appointment of teachers in universities and colleges, the NDA leaders are also hopeful that the central government will bring the necessary bill in the next session of Lok Sabha
 haalanki kisi bhi dal ke netaa hon wo ek baat par samaan vichaar rakhte hai ki ab sarkari naukariyon main niyuktiyan itani kam ho rahi hai ki aarakshan kaa kuan dinodin suukhta ja rahaa he
 But it is also a matter that after the provision of reservation for upper castes, be it scheduled castes or tribes or backward castes, the benefit of reservation which is present at present seems to be less and demand more from among them
 Especially the demand for more reservation from backward castes will increase in the coming days, if someone benefits, then surely someone will have to bear the loss
