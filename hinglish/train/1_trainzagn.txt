 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne haalia loksabhaa chunaav main madhya pradesh se kul 29 loksabhaa siton main se 28 jhatakkar congress ko hairaan kar diya
 The biggest setback for the Congress was the crushing defeat of Jyotiraditya Scindia in his stronghold of Guna
 sindhiya ko ek lakh se adhik voton se haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 For the Congress, the only relief in Madhya Pradesh was one thing and that was hardly victory in Chhindwara against Chief Minister Kamal Nath's son Nakulnath
 india today-exis maai india agsit pole ne madhya pradesh se aise hi loksabhaa chunaav nattejey aane kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 The BJP performed well, securing 58% of the total votes
 bataa den ki 2014 loksabhaa chunaav se is baar 4% adhik vot bijepi ko madhya pradesh main hasil hue
 bjp's vote share 53 in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 8% rahaa tha or use rajya kii 29 main se 27 siton par jeet hasil hui thi
 On the other hand, Congress got only 34% votes in this election
 2018 main madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se congress ko 11% kam vot hasil hue
 Let us know that in the 2018 assembly elections, the Congress got around 45% votes
 exis maai india agsit pole data ke mutabik kamalnath ne mukhyamantri kii shapath lene ke kuch hi ghante baad jis kisaan karj maafee yojana kaa elaan kiya tha, uskaa congress ko loksabhaa chunaav main koi laabh nahin mila
 Among farmers, 55% of the voters preferred to vote for BJP
 vahiin congress ko sirf 38% kisaan votaron ke hi vot mili
 As far as the young voters in the age group of 18-25 are concerned, about 60% of this class voted for the BJP
 is varg se congress ko sirf 32% votaron ne hi vot diya
 It is clear from the real results of the Lok Sabha elections that BJP was chosen as the first choice by all categories along with all age groups
 gruhaniyon, berozegaar yuvakon, kaamkaaji profeshnals, sarkari karmchaaree, chaatr, majdoor, krishi mazdooron ne bad-chadh kar bijepi ko vot diya
 If caste and group-wise data of axis-my-india is analyzed, BJP has a decisive edge over Congress in all categories except Muslims
 muslim votaron main 82% ne congress or 14% ne bijepi ko vot diya
 Be it illiterate, or pass eighth, tenth and twelfth, voters in all classes considered BJP as the first choice
 graduate, post graduate or profeshnal digridharakon main se bhi adhiktar votaron ne bijepi ko vot diya
 Congress leader Salman Khurshid says that finding goodness in the work of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is like 'finding a needle in a pile of straw'
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main congress ke kuch netaaon ne kaha tha ki agar pradhanmantri kuch acha karte hai to unke kaam kii tarif bhi honi chahie
 Khurshid said that the Congress is very concerned about the way the country is running
 gauratlab he ki congress netaa jairam ramesh ne haal hi main kaha tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke prashasnic model main sabakuch kharaab hi nahin he, or unke dwaara kiye gaye kaam ko sweekaar nahin karne or hameshaa unki aalochana karte rahane se kuch nahin hone vaala
 Other Congress leaders Shashi Tharoor and Abhishek Manu Singhvi had supported Jairam Ramesh for this remark and said that Prime Minister Modi should also be praised for doing the right thing
 khurshid ne ravivaar ko se kaha ki meri najar main, modi dwaara kiye gaye achche kaam ko khojna ‘bhuse ke dher main sooyee khojane' jaisaa he
 Regarding the remarks of Ramesh and other leaders for not always criticizing Modi, former Union Minister Khurshid said that he does not want to give a straight answer to anyone as it would lead to further confusion
 khurshid ne kaha, ‘‘ramesh ne vah kaha jo vah kahana chaahate the
 We all speak what we think is appropriate
 jaisaa ki maine kaha ki mere liye modi ke kaam main achchhai khojna bhuse ke dher main sooyee khojane' jaisaa hoga
 During the conversation on the role of the Gandhi family in the advancement of the Congress, Khurshid said that the ground reality is that they are the 'base' of the party
 congress ke varisht netaa ne kaha ki bhaajapa chaahe jo bhi kahe, chunaav parinaam chaahe kuch bhi hon, hamaara abhi bhi maananaa he ki gandhi parivaar hamamen se zyaadaatar se bahut upar he

 Dhoni will no longer play in the Asia Cup and will be replaced by Virat Kohli
 kohli pehle bhi bharat kii captaini kar chuke hai or unke khate main jeet kaa score bahut zyada he
 He has captained India in 8 odis and won 7 of them
 ab phir ek baar unhen bharat ke sammaan kii raksha kerani he
 This time things are not in his favor as in the three-nation series in which he left no stone unturned to defeat Sri Lanka and the West Indies
 is baar phir srilanka unke saamne hogi jo abhi bangladesh main hi cricket khel rahi he
 They also have two hands each from India's arch-rivals Pakistan team
 unke paas tej gendbaajon kii acchhee qatari he or kai yuva pratibhashali khilaadi bhi hai
 Virat is said to be not only technically superior in terms of batting but also has a greater range of shots
 yani ki vah kisi bhi gendbaaj kii gendon par ran bana sakate hai
 And this strength of theirs gives them confidence, the team of India does not look as brave as they did after the departure of their trinity and so Virat will have to do something so that people remember him
 2015 ke pehle bharat kii team ko urjavan banaae rakhane kii jimmedaari unke bhi kandhon par he
 And so in every small and big tournament, victory will matter
 itnaa hi nahin vah unhen bhavishya ke captain ke rup main sthapit bhi karegi
 Virat has many qualities that were in India's most aggressive captain Saurabh Ganguly
 vah unki hi tarah field main akraman karte hai or chunautiyon kaa swaagat karte hai
 They have a lot of energy that encourages other players as well
 cricket unka pyaar he or isamen vah sir se paanv tak duube hue hai
 This intoxication sets them apart from other players
 unke andar ek aag he jo unhen kuch kar dikhaane ko prerit karata he
 This fire can deliver them to highs, but they may also have to pay the price that Virender Sehwag is paying
 yahaan unhen mahendra singh dhoni ko yaad rakhana hoga jinhone apane andar kii aag ko niyantrit karke duniya jeet lee
 He has to remember Sachin, who was an amazing combination of patience and aggression
 unki ballebaaji kaaphi had tak sachin kii tarah he or vah unheen kii tarah record banaate ja rahe hai
 This is a great opportunity for Virat Kohli
 unhen ballebaaji kaa shandaar pradarshan karte hue apane ek behtareen captain bhi sabit karnaa hoga
 a win against Pakistan would lift their graph, much higher

 The moment the accident occurred, the children were listening to the radio while sitting in the same car
 ek senior officer ke mutabik, 'dhamaake kii asli vajah nahin pataa chal pai he
 But within a few minutes the car burned down
 local logon ne aag bujhane kii koshish kii, lekin madad ke pahunchane se pehle 3 bacchon kii maut ho chuki thi

 ' The BJP is all set to cash in on the image of accused Sadhvi Pragya in the Malegaon blast
 dilli main bijepi ke pradesh pravaktaa tejender paal singh bagga ne sadhvi pragna ke poster lagavaaye hai
 It is now written with the poster that justice will be done
 poster main sadhvi kii us tasviir kaa istemaal kiya gaya he, jisamen wo aspataal ilaaj karaane ja rahi hai
 Significantly, Sadhvi has been fielded by BJP from Bhopal against Congress's Digvijay Singh, which has sparked a huge political controversy
 bhopal se sadhvi pragna singh ke bijepi pratyaashee banaae jane ke baad siyasat shuru ho gai he
 The BJP is now busy cashing in on the Hindutva agenda
 dilli bijepi pravaktaa tejender paal singh bagga ne dilli bijepi daftar ke baahar ek poster lagaaya he, jisame sadhvi pragna thakur ko bistar par biimaar halaat main adlete dikhaaya gaya he, saath main poster par kataaksh karte hue congress kaa naaraa 'ab hoga nyaay' likhaa he
 After the announcement of Sadhvi Pragya Singh from Delhi to Bhopal
 
 
 srinagar se hyderabad tak koharaam machaa hua he
 Questions are being asked that what has the BJP done by fielding Sadhvi Pragya, accused in the Malegaon bomb blast? The fingers are raised on the BJP that the party has made the accused of terrorism to play the Hindutva card, but neither the party has any dilemma nor Sadhvi Pragya on this issue
 guuruuvaar ko ajtak se khaas baatcheet main sadhvi pragna thakur ne congress par utpeedan kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 He had said that the NI has said in the court that there is no evidence against him in the court
 isliye ve nirdosh hai
 i have never been in controversies
 meraa jo jivan he bahut pehle se aap dekh rahe hai ki mere upar koi ansh maatr kaa bhi aarope nahin tha
 The controversy that has created this is called saffron terrorism, Hindutva is called terrorism
 yah shadyantr inkaa(congress) he or inhone hi vivaad khadaa kiya he
 So they are getting scared
 bijepi ke sadhvi card ne congress ko pasopesh main daal diya he
 The party is already on the backfoot when the Hindu terrorism theory is upheld
 aise main party aakraamak bayaanbaji kar vivaad khadaa karne se bachati najar rahi he
 Digvijay Singh, standing in front of Pragya himself in Bhopal, is looking very soft
 lekin, sadhvi ko duusare tareeke se gherne kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 Tehseen Poonawala has written a letter to the Election Commission asking Sadhvi Pragya to be prevented from contesting as she is an accused in a terrorism case

 Burns took 3 wickets for 33 runs in the match, although the Northern Knights scored 212 / 9 in 20 overs
 burns apni team ko jeet nahin dilaa sake

 It is done on the day of Deepavali i
e
 Amavasya at midnight
 kyon hoti he kaali maa kii puja:ek amavasya main maa durga kaa aagaman hota he
 Which we know as Shardiya Navratri
 15 din baad duusari amavasya main maa kaali kii puja karne kii pratha bengal main rahi he
 Lakshmi is worshiped separately: Laxmi is worshiped in Bengal 6 days after Dashami
 haalanki, jaise uttar bharat or desh ke baaki hisson main lakshmi ke saath ganesh kii puja hoti he vaise lakshmi kii puja nahin hoti he
 In Bengal, only the idol of Maa Lakshmi is installed on the day of Lakshmi Puja

 Their archana are disease free
 rahu or ketu kii shanti ke liye maa kaali kii upasna achook he
 Mother protects her devotees and destroys their enemies
 inaki puja se tantra-mantra kaa asar khatm ho jaataa he
 Rules of worship of Kali: Mother Kali is worshiped in two ways, one is general and the other is Tantra worship
 saamaanya pujaakoi bhi kar saktaa he, par tantra puja bina guru ke sangrakshan or nirdeshon ke nahin kii ja sakati
 The right time to worship Kali is midnight
 inaki puja main laal or kaali vastuon kaa vishesh mahatv he
 It is more appropriate to meditate on them than chanting Maa Kali dushmano se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye karen kaali kii upasna:maa kaali kii upasna shatru or virdohi ko shant karne ke liye kerani chahie kisi ke mrityu ke liye nahin
 If you are upset with an opponent or an enemy, then these are the ways to avoid that problem
 aapke shatru agar aapako pareshaan karte hon to aap laal kapade pahanakar laal asana par baithen maa kaali ke samaksh deepak or guggal kii dhoop jalaaen
 Offer prades and cloves in prasad to the mother
 iske baad 'uun kreen kalikayai namah' kaa 11 maala jaap karke, shatru or mukademe se mukti kii prarthana karen
 Do not touch water for 15 minutes after chanting the mantra
 yah archana lagaataar 27 raaton tak karen
 It is believed that by doing these measures, you can get the blessings of Maa Kali

 On April 4, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman held a press conference on these things

 On page number 41, Congress has said about Jammu and Kashmir that Article 370 of India has been included
 is sanvaidhanik sthiti ko badalane kii na to anumati di jaaegi or na hi aisa kuch prayaas kiya jayega
 It has been the agenda of BJP and RSS since the beginning that Article 370 will change

 Will change the law to balance security needs and protection of human rights
 congress ne hataane kii baat nahin kii he phir bijepi ko kyon lagata he ki congress ne desh todane kii baat kahi he? sitambar 2016 main sargical strike kaa netritv karne vaale ritred leftinent general dies hooda ne haal hi main congress ke liye suraksha par ek dastauez taiyaar kar diya he
 GS Hooda's suggestions have become part of the Congress manifesto

 In the live mint of 1 December 2014, Jammu and Kashmir BJP leader Ramesh Arora's statement that the plaintiff will create such an environment that all work will be done without any fear and peacefully and such strict rules will not be needed, but 18 March 2017 Ram Madhav's statement to Ko was that it is not a joking law to remove it

 iske baad supreme court ke purv jaj justise beepi jivan reddy cameti bani thi
 This committee suggested that AFSPA should be abolished
 yah kanoon nafrat or bhedbhaav kaa pratik ban chukaa he, lekin beepi jivan reddy kii cameti north east ke sandarbh main bani thi, to ek purv jaj, sena ke purv leftinent general agar afaspa ko hataane yaa samiksha kii baat karte hai to yah deshvirohi kaise ho gaya? desh ko todane vaala kaise ho gaya? 14 november 2018 ko supreme court ne ek faisla diya tha
 The case was that a Public Interest Litigation was filed in the Supreme Court that between 1980 and 2011 in Manipur, the army, paramilitary forces, Manipur Police had committed extra-judicial killing of 1528 people
 isaki jaanch karai jaae
 The Supreme Court ordered a CBI inquiry
 is faisle ke khilaaf jab 700 sena ke purv adhikari milakar court gaye ki aisa nahin hona chahie
 The CBI cannot investigate nor can it be an FIR if the Supreme Court rejects their petition
 is yachika ko centre sarkaar ne bhi samarthan diya tha
 The Supreme Court justices Madan B
 Lokur and Justice UU Lalit had said that they should remember those who do politics about the morale of the army
 donon mananeey jajon ne kaha tha ki sena, ardhsainik balon or rajya police ke manobal girane ke bhoot ko khadaa karnaa sahi nahin he
 Did the country break down with this decision of the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne yahi to kaha ki baar baar manobal girane ke pret ko laana sahi nahin he
 Obviously, morale does not drop so easily
 jammu kashmir kaa maamla pechida he
 Many such people who run for any statement regarding this matter do not search even a news on the Internet
 magar kashmir par raay zarur rakhte hai
 Tell me, isn't this treason? whatsap massej aata he
 i have an opinion on the Khalihar people who are doing Kashmir course at Whatsapp University
 zarur kashmir vivaad par raay rakhen magar thodaa padhein
 It will be known from reading that the Supreme Court said that do not create the ghost of morale
 supreme court ne sibiai jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 You will remember that the case of stone pelting in Jammu and Kashmir was widely on the channels
 samasya to thi hi wo, lekin baad main kya hua
 Remind you aap internet par india today, outluk, times of india, hindu, scrol, vir main search kiijie
 The date is 3 February 2018
 is khabar main yahi he ki grih mantralay ne kul 9,730 logon ke khilaaf maamle waapas liye gaye hai
 Cases against 1,745 have been withdrawn with certain conditions
 yah jaankaree mahabuuba mufti ne vidhansabha main likhit jawaab main diya tha
 The same has been published by newspapers
 jab saare cese waapas liye gaye tab unheen channelon par aapane din-raat hangaamaa dekha tha
 The government had seen the challenge
 tab to mahabuuba ke saath bijepi kii hi sarkaar jammu kashmir main thi
 In Hindustan Times, on 7 June 2018, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that the government has withdrawn the cases because the youth can be tricked
 unase galati ho jaati he
 It is written in the news that Rajnath Singh said this in front of six thousand youths at the Shere Kashmir Indoor Stadium
 grahamantri kii yah baat ek grahamantri jaisaa he
 If you ask those who watch whatsapp University and News Channel of North India, they will say that the stone-pelter is a terrorist
 news channelon ne patharbazon ko lekar khub bhadakaau kaarykram kiye, jinamein aar-paar kii baat hoti thi
 But as you heard Rajnath Singh, he was not talking through the stones
 unhen mauka de rahe the
 They were opening the way for dialogue
 ab koi bhi bina padhe liye gyani samajhane vaale ankar elaan kar saktaa tha ki grahamantri ne sena kaa manobal gira diya, kyonki pathar to sena ke khilaaf chalaa tha magar 10,000 patharbazon se mukadmaa waapas le liya gaya
 No one said that morale fell
 aaj tak news channel ke kaarykram panchayat main grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha tha ki main yah vishwaas karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hum ki patharbaz aatankwaadi hote hai
 You can listen to this interview on youtube
 kashmir par khub padhie
 The good thing is that you want to have an opinion about it, but please do not form an opinion on Kashmir by watching please news channels and reading Hindi newspapers
 usase acha he shaam ko tahal aaen or ganna chabaayen isse daant saaf honge or majboot bhi
 Do not worry about the morale of the army
 sena kaa manobal is baat se bhi girtaa hoga, agar girtaa he to jab yogi adityanath bharat kii sena ko modi kii sena bataa dete hai
 By the way, be sure that the morale of the Indian Army never falls at least from India's declining political level
 netaaon ke kharaab bhaashan se to bilkul kisi sainik kaa manobal nahin girtaa he
 Morale is not the force that falls from speaking
 yah meri theory he, lekin mujhe koi nobel prize nahin detaa he
 Congress has written on page number-35 of its manifesto that section 124A (which defines the offense of treason) of the Indian Penal Code, which was misused, has also lost its importance due to the new law, It will be eradicated
 whatsap uniwarsity ke kai chaatro ne aaj yah sawaal poocha ki kya congress deshadroh ko badhaava de rahi he, kanoon ko samaapt kar de rahi he? is kanoon ko samaapt karne ke liye kitaaben likhi gayi hai
 Gautam Bhatia's book written in English is Offend, Shock and Disturb
 750 kii he or oxford uniwarsity press se chhapi he
 There is good information about this law of sedition
 use padhein
 This law has always been used to crush freedom of expression
 1870 main angrez laae the taaki british hukumat ke khilaaf asantosh bhadakaane yaa sarkaar se prati kaam karne waalon par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaakar kuchlaa ja sake
 It was used against freedom fighters, journalists, lawyers of the time
 aapako mahaan swatantraaa senaanee bal gangadhar tilak kaa cese yaad hoga
 Trial went on in 1897
 gandhiji par bhi deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaa
 Gautam Bhatia has mentioned in his book the debate in the Constituent Assembly about the law, different decisions of the High Court in independent India and different decisions of the Supreme Court
 1995 main balavant singh banaam punjab sarkaar ke cese kaa udhaaharan diya he
 After the assassination of Indira Gandhi, some youths were accused of sedition by raising slogans of Khalistan Zindabad
 court ne is binah par bari kar diya ki spich se koi fark nahin padataa
 There was no violence in the chanting of slogans
 kanoon vyavastha nahin bigadi
 In 1860 the British created the Indian Penal Code
 isamen deshadroh kaa maamla nahin tha
 This provision came when the Deoband clerics vowed against the British that the freedom struggle was an Islamic duty and a law of treason was brought to crush it
 yah kanoon aayaa hi deshbhakti kii bhaavana ko kuchalane ke liye
 How can it hurt the spirit of patriotism
 agar aap whatsap uniwarsity main time bithaayenge to yah sab pataa nahin chalegaa
 This provision of treason is being used to crush the right to freedom of expression and political protest

 behatar he ki congress apni pichhali galatiyon se sikh rahi he
 She is right
 congress ne apane ghoshnaa patr main ek or baat kahi he jise lekar na charchaa he na vivaad he
 It is said that they will amend section 499 of the Indian Penal Code and make defamation a criminal offense
 ab kisi ko manahani ke aparaadh main jail nahin hogi
 So you will get rid of the gel and the vine
 jeetenge to muawza milegaa
 In my opinion, the amount of compensation should also be fixed
 samvidhan ke hisaab se ham sab samaan hai to ham sabakaa maan ek hona chahie
 No one should be defamed more than defamation of one and a quarter rupees
 ham kisi corporate par tippanee kar den to manahani kaa cese kar degaa
 Of several thousand crores
 yah thik nahin hoga
 If you make a corporate case and win, then take defamation of one and a quarter rupees
 haath kaa haath de denge
 Chawni will come out holding the check instead
 idia he ki nahin jabardast
 By the way, Charani has been closed since 2011

 Akali Dal President and former Deputy Chief Minister of Punjab Sukhbir Singh Badal was seen in the BJP love in such a way that he even said that whether India will remain or not but Akali Dal will remain with BJP
 yah maamla ravivaar kaa he, jab punjab bhaajapa pramukh vijay saanpala ne akali dal or bhaajapa dwaara jalandhar main yojit 'bajaao dhol kholo pole' raily ko sambodhit karte hue achaanak apane sahyogi dal ko ye hidaayat de daali ki vah ye samajhane kii bhul naa karen ki bhaajapa ke paas janaadhar nahin he
 Akali Dal President Sukhbir Badal remembered the bjp's love due to the instructions of the BJP President and he even said that he will remain with the BJP even if India does not exist, calling the BJP the elder brother of the Akali Dal
 akali dal ne 'bajaao dhol kholo pole' raily kaa aayojan punjab congress sarkaar ke ek saal ke kaarykaal kii pole kholane ke liye kiya tha lekin sahyogi bhaajapa adhyaksh ne hi akali dal kii pole khol di
 After that Sukhbir Badal said that 'bharatiya Janata Party is the heart of Shiromani Akali Dal, they have to live and die with BJP
 bhaajapa ke saath koi rahe yaa na rahe, hindustan rahe yaa naa rahe ham to aapke saath hi rahenge
 'his statement has created controversy
 unke is bayaan par bhartiya janata party ne sukhbir badal kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki unki aisi koi manshaa nahin thi, vah galati se aisa bol gaye
 The Akali Dal also said that Sukhbir Badal's talk is being made in vain, even though he had no such intention
 sukhbir badal kii jubaan bhale hi phisal gai ho lekin desh main, khaskar haal hi main jis tarah purvottar main bhaajapa kaa janaadhar bad rahaa he usase ab punjab kebhajapa netaonke hausale bhi buland hai
 This is the reason why the Punjab BJP president told the Akali Dal from the filled platform that he should not at least talk about the base
 bataa den ki punjab main bhaajapa kaa vot bank akali dal kii tulana main kaaphi kam he isliye bhaajapa ne akali dal ke saath gathbandhan kiya tha

 a post shared by disha patani (paatni) (@dishapatani) on Mar 8, 2018 at 8:44am PST Amidst the period of accusations and counter-accusations that started on 'low politics', Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Thursday attacked the Prime Ministerial candidate of BJP, Narendra Modi, and said on Thursday that the person who has 'low thinking' towards a community and If you harm the culture of the country, how will that country handle it
 sonia ne kaha ki bhaajapa jati-dharm ke pher main logon ko gumraah kar unhen fansaana chaahati he
 She is committing a sin by messing with mixed culture and social harmony
 aisa gunaah koi or nahin ho saktaa
 The Congress president lashed out at Modi in a sarcastic manner at the election meetings held in support of the party candidates from Salimpur and Kushinagar, saying, "A person who has a low attitude towards one community
" jo apni soch se desh kii tahjeeb ko nuksaan pahunchaata ho, jo patan kii sari simaaen todta ho, uske haath main desh dena sahi nahin hoga
 ' unhone kaha 'hamaare desh main bahut se pradhanmantri aaye
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also our Prime Minister but he maintained the dignity of the post
 modi ne raajnneetik swaarth saadhane ke liye rajeev ji kii shahadat ke 23 saal baad un par tippanee kii
 What to say if you don't call it frivolous
 jo vyakti piem banane kaa sapana dekh rahaa ho unhen is mahaan desh kii samskruti, udaartaa kaa khyaal jarur rakhana chahie
 Such statements do not suit the politics of the country
 agar unki kathani aisi he to kerani kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 ' sonia ne kaha 'bharat ek saamaajik taane bane vaala desh he
 It is not a minor thing to lead it
 iskaa netritv tyaag or balidaan, udaartaa or bhaichaare par aadhaarit hota he lekin jinaki ankhon main tahjeeb chubhti ho, ve desh kaise sambhaalenge
 ' congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki duniya congressnith sarkaar dwaara lagu kiye gayi rojgaar guarantee kanoon or khaadya suraksha kanoon ko sammaan kii najar se dekh rahi he or usase sikh rahi he lekin bhaajapa in yojanaon ko khatm karnaa chaahati he
 This can be gauged by his hostility towards the poor
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki bhaajapa jati-dharm ke pher main logon ko gumraah kar unhen fansaana chaahati he
 She is committing a sin by messing with mixed culture and social harmony
 aisa gunaah koi or nahin ho saktaa
 Sonia claimed that despite the economic slowdown during the tenure of the Congress government, the economy was doing well
 desh main pragati kii jo maujuuda raftaar he vah pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii nitiyon or sabhi ke sangharsh kaa nateeja he
 The Congress president said that Modi is trying to gain votes by showing a false picture of development
 unhone kaha 'modi jis gujarat main apane tarifon ke pul baandh rahe hai, uski haalat kuch or he
 There are a large number of children and women who are malnourished, 40 percent of people do not get drinking and irrigation water
 kisaan buniyadi suvidhaon ke liye taras rahe hai
 It is a shame that the government there does not consider a person earning Rs 11 a day as poor
 ' He said, 'you know what you get for 11 rupees
 agar ham maane ki yah sahi he to bhi gujarat main 40 lakh parivaar garibi rekha se neeche jivan-yaapan karte hai
 Think if the person who makes this situation in Gujarat becomes Prime Minister, then how will the future of your children be
 ' Sonia said, 'modi is also accusing us of weakness in fighting terrorism
 aapako yaad hoga jab bhaajapa kii sarkaar kendra main chah saal tak rahi, us samay aatankwaadi ghatnaon main desh main hajaaron log maare gayi the
 It is a scene of suffering in front of my eyes
 amarnath yatra par hamalaa, nandigram, laalchowk samet kai sthanon ke daure ke dauraan jo takalif hui use vyakt karnaa mushkil he
 ' sonia ne daawa kiya ki congressnith sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) ne jo kadam uthaae uskaa nateeja he ki aatankwaadi vaardaat main kami aayi he
 Congress has always faced and will proceed vigorously on matters related to internal and external security
 sonia ne kaha ki koi desh tabhi sarhadon kii hifaazat kar saktaa he jab khet khalihaan hare-bhare rahen
 The UPA government implemented 'one Rank One Pension' for soldiers
 sainikon kii yah maang bhaajapanit rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) ke jamaane se chal rahi thi lekin unhone nahin mana
 He said that the UPA government waived the debt of farmers, doubled the purchase price
 kisaanon ke hit main aage bhi kai thos kadam uthaae jaaenge
 To benefit a large number of farmers, easy loans up to five lakh to small and marginal farmers, projects for irrigation, ponds, pastures and poultry programs will be linked to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
 sonia ne kaha ki is baar kendra main sarkaar banane par sabhi ko aspataal main muft dawa or ilaaj kaa adhikaar, bujurgo ke liye pension kaa adhikaar diya jayega
 Even in this era of promotion, people live in slums and spend life under foil roofs in cities, Congress will give such people the legal right to a roof
 navajavaanon ko hunarmand banaakar rojgaar ke avasar degi
 Sonia said that in this election you have people who do not believe in social brotherhood
 samaaj main foot daalate hai, desh ko vahaan le janaa chaahate hai jahaan satta or daulat chand haathon main ho or kamjor kii aawaaj dab jaae
 On the other hand, the Congress has sacrificed to maintain the integrity of the country
 hamaari vichaardhaara ek khule hue aaazaad samaaj kii kalpana karti he jahaan sabaki aawaaj suni jaae
 ' unhone kaha ki is chunaav main janata ko faisla karnaa he
 Believe that you will make the right decision

 Every Prime Minister must have realized the seriousness and importance of that occasion while hoisting the flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort amidst the roar of cannons and the national anthem on Independence Day
 aaazaad bharat kaa gaurav or usase judi ummiido kaa jabardast boj donon hi uske kadam ko baari karte honge
 Narendra Modi must have realized this while addressing the nation for the fifth consecutive time from this monument of 378 years old Mughal period
 vah ehsaas vaaki nashila or sanjeeda hoga ki aap par desh ke 1
 3 billion people have an eye and every action they take will be like an interview with their personal destiny
 15 agast, 2014 ko jab modi ne pradhanmantri ke taur par apana pehla bhaashan diya tha, unhone khud ko aise bahari shaks ke taur par pesh kiya tha, jise desh kaa kayapalat karne, pichhali sarkaar ke nitigat lakve ko khatm karne or mand padati arthvyavastha main nai jaan foonkane kaa janadesh hasil hua tha
 He announced several innovative programs, including his most special Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 chaar saal baad 2018 main modi bilkul bhitari shaks ban chuke hai or sarvocch kaman unke haath he
 He spoke with full eloquence of his government's work and achievements in every area and for every section of poor, backward, farmers, middle class, businessmen, youth and women
 pradhanmantri ke bhaashan kii badi baat yah thi—meri sarkaar ne kar dikhaaya he
 He knew that this would be his last chance to address the nation before the general elections to be held in May 2019
 lihaaja, modi ne is manch kaa istemaal satta main apni dobaaraa vaapasi ke abhiyaan ke aagaaj kii tarah kiya
 He presented a picture of "new India" and a new phase of development, which would "house, electricity, water, LPG, toilets, skills, health, insurance and connectivity for all"
 is tarah unhone vah agenda tay kar diya jisaki desh bhar main na keval vyapak apil hogi, balki jisaki barabari kar paane main unke virdohi mushkil paaenge
 So, Modi's second big message was - i have the vision, mission and passion that goes beyond 2019 - so vote for me again
 modi kaa nayaa indiamodi ke samarthakon ko yakeen he ki swatantraaa diwas par unka yah aakhri bhaashan nahin hoga or unka doosraa kaarykaal jeetna tay he
 Nevertheless, this confidence should be shaken by the results of the India Today group-karvy Insights country's opinion poll, which happens twice a year
 yah survey modi or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main vaisaa hi bahumat jeetne kii sambhaavna par andeh kii chaaya daal detaa he, jaisaa unhone 2014 ke aam chunaav main hasil kiya tha
 This latest survey of the country's mood series, done in July, shows that the comfortable gains of 298 seats for the BJP in the July 2017 survey has come down to 245 seats - which is necessary for a majority on its own
 There are 27 fewer than 272 seats
 survey yah bhi bataata he ki rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) ke apane sahyogi dalon ke saath bhaajapa 281 siton ke saath kisi tarah satta mahaj kaayam rakh paaegi, jo party ko gathbandhan ke saajhedaaron kii khinchataan or dabaavon ke aage majaboor or kamjor bana degaa
 An even more worrying survey for the BJP is the possibility in which the opposition if united and form a grand alliance that mainly comprises Congress, Trinamool Congress (TMC), Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Janata Dal (secular) Will be agar aisa hota he, to yah gathbandhan 224 tak siten jeet saktaa he or endie kii barabari par aa saktaa he jisaki siten ghatakar 228 rah jaaengi
 In such a situation, the Parliament will be hung
 bhaajapa kii apni siten ghatakar 194 par aa jaaengi
 Even then it will be the largest party, but to form the government, it will have to depend badly on the breakdown of its allies and parties
 aisi sthiti main bhaajapa ke vot khinchne vaale sabase damdaar netaa ke taur par modi kii saakh ko gambhir dhakka lagegaa or endie ke sahyogi dalon main pradhanmantri ke taur par unki sweekaaryata par andeh ke badal mandaraane lagenge
 Perhaps Modi himself is unwilling to rule on such a swarm of parties because then he may have to face difficulties in running such an alliance in which he will not be listened to fearlessly as it is now
 survey ek teesri sambhaavna par bhi vichaar karata he, jisamen annadramuk endie main shaamil ho jaati he
 If this happens, the NDA coalition may still lag behind by a majority
 to, modi ne jin tamaam uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan kiya, un sabake baavjood aisa kyon he ki desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main shaamil log shaq-shubahe se bhare hai or modi or bhaajapa ko purna bahumat nahin dena chaahate? ek baat to yah he ki sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se santusht logon kii taadaad ab bhi acchhee-khaasi he par lagaataar girti gai he—janvari 2017 ke survey main 71 fisadi ke sabase oonche str se girakar ab yah 56 fisadi ke aasapaas aa gai he
 What is encouraging for Modi is that he is still considered the best leader ever to become prime minister with 49 per cent — the fourth year of his tenure is by any standards
 magar ve utane lokapriy nahin rah gaye hai jitne dedh saal pehle the jab unki reating 65 fisadi par thi
 It can also be disturbing for BJP supporters that the survey shows that Rahul Gandhi's popularity is on the rise again and his rating has increased from a low of 10% of the January 2017 survey to 27% this time
 is
 modi or unke bich ab bhi 22 pratishat ankon ko bada faasla he, par yah bataata he ki congress adhyaksh kenate rahul gandhi chalanger banakar ubhar rahe hai or unki chhavi kaa graph lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 Another reason is that every prime minister must work on the three basic issues that the mood of every country puts at the top of the list of concerns - jobs, price increases and corruption
 hamaara tazatreen survey dikhaata he ki bhrashtachar par lagaam lagane ko ab bhi modi kii sabase badi kamyaabi ke taur par dekha jaataa he—kaale dhan ke khilaaf kadi karrwai, sarkaar ke bheetar bhrashtachar main kami or notebandi ko milakar 44 fisadi kaa samarthan mila he
 While he has been patted on for bringing GST, Swachh Bharat and infrastructure development programs, many other schemes of the NDA government have received a lukewarm response, including the much hyped Jan Dhan Yojana, Digital India and Direct Benefit Transfer
 mahangaai par kaabo paane ke bare main survey dikhaata he ki unke liye pareshaani bad rahi he kyonki dharna yah he ki keemton main badhotaree khatre kaa nishaan paar kar gai he
 The job is difficult because of lack of heavy jobs is the real reason for the Prime Minister's concern
 naukariyon kii kami modi sarkaar kii sabase badi vifaltaa he, aisa maanane vaale logon kaa pratishat pichley surveykshan main jahaan 22 fisadi tha, vah is surveykshan main badhkar 29 fisadi ho gaya he
 However, the Prime Minister repeatedly tries to cite the data of the Employees Provident Fund Register to show that there has been a huge increase in jobs during his government tenure and sectors like tourism, construction sector and aviation, which have huge employment opportunities
 Are born, has developed at a rapid pace in the last four years, which has created new jobs
 notebandi aatmghaatee sabit hui kyonki logon ko lagata he ki isane anaupchaarik kshetra ko tabah kar diya
 There has also been a significant increase in the number of people who believe that Narendra Modi's promise of "good days" was just an election jumla
 janvari 2017 main 24 pratishat log aisa maanate the, philhal 43 pratishat logon kii pradhanmantri ke bare main aisi hi dharna ban chuki he
 Although his overall rating may have fallen, Modi's work in areas such as increasing drinking water, electricity, roads and rail connectivity, besides foreign policy, has received much praise in the survey
 aagaamee aam chunaav main bahut se kaarak modi ke paksh main bhi dikh rahe hai
 The 2019 elections are barely nine months away
 baavjood iske, vipaksh abhi tak na majboot gathbandhan bana paaya he na hi modi ko chunauti dene ke liye damdaar agenda taiyaar kar paaya he
 Opponents of Modi have no alternative viewpoint to convince the public that they have the ability to take the country forward by giving a better government than the BJP
 upie sarkaar ke aakhri varshon ke pradarshan ko log itani aasaani se bhula den, isaki sambhaavna nahin dikhti kyonki antim varshon ke kharaab kaamkaaj ke aage janata ne upie sarkaar kii sari uplabdhiyon tak ko bhula diya tha
 Despite the rise of Rahul Gandhi, Modi still seems to be at the pinnacle in the political scene
 vipaksh guna-bhaag main majboot ho saktaa he, lekin modi janata ke saath judye kii kala ke dhani hai
 In Gujarat and Karnataka elections too, the Modi factor gave the BJP an edge
 rode beshumharmodi ne aarthik vikaas dar ko ausat 7
 5 percent to which they should be given credit but they are aware that to meet the aspirations of the people, especially on the jobs front, the growth rate needs to reach double digits
 saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon ke duubat karjon ke ambara ne unke abhiyaan ko gahari kshati pahunchaai he
 Private investment is stagnant, exports are falling and automation has increased and the production sector has not been able to create as many jobs as it did in the last decade
 krishi sankat lagaataar bana hua he or sarkaar ne use dur karne ke prayaas karne kii jagah, ab tak maatr uske jackchamon par thodaa-bahut maraham bhar hi lagaaya he
 This has increased the employment crisis among the poorest sections
 bhartiya matadaata jaanate hai ki aise mushkil halaat main desh ko sanbhaalane ke liye ek paripakv, mehnatee, eemaandaar or drudh pradhanmantri kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 And that's why they consider Modi the best
 modi kii vyaktigat nishtha or eemaandaaree par kabhi sawalia nishaan nahin lage hai
 Those who work with him speak of Modi's ability to see how Modi has the vision to take it to the next higher level by connecting links to various programs he has started
 vah vyaktigat rup se in yojanaon kii pragati par najar rakhte hai, pragati kii gati se naakhush hai or uskaa laabh aakhri kone tak pahunchane ke liye lagaataar lakshya ko aage khiskaate rahete hai
 The last Dhakkamodi has so far focused on the basics of development which is a good thing
 lekin unhen pataa he ki bharat ko viksit rashtron kii qatari main khadey hona he or shaktishaalee bananaa he, to ek asaadhaaran aarthik parivartan kii nitant aavashyaktaa hogi
 One of his colleagues compares it to a high-speed aircraft, and Modi is impatient to speed up processes that will bring major changes in technology, skills, marketing, transparency, speed and honesty
 apane swatantraaa diwas ke bhaashan main pradhanmantri ne beej-se-bazaar tak krishi ke aadhunikeekaran, gunvattta badhaane or is kshetra ko adhik niryatonmukh banane ke bare main baat kii
 However, these liberal ideals need to be tested tightly to the reality
 is desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main modi ke liye bade sandesh chupe hai—modi ko adhik samaveshi hona padegaa, khaskar apane sahyogiyon ke prati, kyonki jarurat padane par ve hi unhen sahaara denge
 His government remains in the grip of dealing with issues of internal security such as caste conflicts, mob violence in the name of cow protection
 apane swatantraaa diwas bhaashan main modi ne kaha ki unki sarkaar kanoon-vyavastha kaa ulanghan karne waalon ke saath zyada sakchati se nibategi
 The Prime Minister should also take a lesson from Rudyard Kipling's book Jungle Book, in which Mowgli and all the animals reiterate, "this is the law of the jungle, as old and truthful as the sky; and the wolf who will keep it can flourish, but The wolf who breaks it is sure to die
 jaise bel kisi ped ke tane ke chaaron ore lipati rahati he usee tarah kanoon aage or peeche chalaata he; kyonki jhund kii takat bhedipha he, or bhedifee kii takat jhund he
 "modi is a lion in India's political wilderness, but he needs to accept and embark on the ground realities to keep the party, government and country strong and united

 usne police ko bataaya ki vah visphot ke samay bihar kii rajdhani patna main maujuud tha hi nahin, na hi use is yojana kii jaankaree thi
 But records of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) interrogation date back to India Today, according to which Faizal had met Haider in a village near Ranchi several weeks before the explosive attacks
 vahaan patna hamalon kaa aaropee imtiyaaj ali bhi maujuud tha jise hamale ke baad ghatnasthal se hi giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 Faizal was arrested two months later on 18 December 2013 by the Madhya Pradesh Police on his way to Gulbarga
 vah apane ek saathi se milane ja rahaa tha
 His plan was to attack the Bajrang Dal office to avenge the 2002 riots
 haidar or mujibulla ke bare main mili jaankaree jaanch agenciyon ke liye nirnaayak siddh hui, tab unhen ehsaas ho gaya ki shahar main ek nayaa aantki gut jam gaya he
 Officials also give it the name 'fresh Module'
 ve log maan chuke the ki hamale indian mujahiddeen (iem) kii karatuut thi jo desh main nai musiibat laane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 But the authorities' estimate was also wrong this time
 agle paanch maah main yah sabit hona tha ki hamale ek jane-pahachaane sanghathan ne kiye hai, lekin nae tareeke se
 The militant banned faction was a militant-revolutionary group out of the womb of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI)
 haalanki ghatana kaa byora to tabhi milanaa shuru ho gaya tha jab enie ne 22 may ko haidar or mujibulla ko ranchi ke nikat pakadaa, usase pehle hi ek badi tasviir saamne aani shuru ho gai thi
 The investigation took the NIA closer to Safdar Nagauri, the lead ideologue of SIMI militant faction, who was arrested in November 2008 but aware of every latest incident
 aise main faijal kii giraftaar mahatvapurn sabit hui
 The change in strategy was confirmed by what Nagouri told
 sim (nagauri ne dilli main jaanchakartaaon ko bataaya ki unke gut ne 'aai’ hataa dene kaa faisla kiya he
 ) Previously, this group used to provide strategic help and jihadi to prepare terrorist groups, but now it has taken the responsibility of attacking itself, possibly killing big leaders
 dilli hycourt kii adhyakshata vaale panchat ne 30 july ko agle paanch saal tak phir pratibandh lagane ke faisle ko manjuuri de di, agenciyaan maathapai kar rahi thim ki ab simi se judaa koun-sa nayaa gut taiyaar ho gaya he
 Simi's arrested operatives in a Bhopal court on the day of general election results on 16 May raised the slogan, "this time Modi's number
" ” beshak suraksha agenciyaan sakate main aa gayi or badhavaasee se bhavi pradhanmantri ke dilli pahunchane se pehle hi unki suraksha vyavastha kii samiksha main jute gayi
 The NIA interrogation may be part of the chargesheet in the Patna blast case
 shuruyatdilli police ke special cell kii poochtacha main nagauri ne bataaya ki 2001 main pratibandh lagane ke baad simi kii central ripregentatius council (siarsi) jise majalis-e-shura bhi kehete hai, kii baithkon main faisla liya gaya ki 'vaicharik khuraaq’ ke alaava shaareerik prashikshan par bhi jor diya janaa chahie, jaisaa rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) kii shakhaon main hota he
 Individuals must do martial arts training at a personal level
 nagauri ne yah bhi bataaya ki esaiem usee ugravadi gut kaa utpaada he, jise usne hi simi main shuru kiya tha
 Signs of disunity at SIMI began to appear in 2006, when it was decided to set the membership age limit to 30 years, in order to maintain the young-student character of the organization
 is vajah se nagauri kii sadsyta khatm ho gai
 But disgusted with this decision, the Nagori faction decided to hold a meeting in July at a farm house near Ujjain
 alag gut kii maang pehle-pahal yaheen uthi or ise uthaane vaala yuva chaatr ehteshaam siddiki tha, lekin gut ke duusare sadasyon kaa maananaa tha ki is sab ke liye abhi intjaar kiya janaa chahie
 Soon after the meeting, Siddiqui was arrested for his alleged involvement in the Mumbai blasts
 haalanki vah bekasoor hone kaa daawa karata he
 Nagauri told investigators that before the arrest, it was decided to set up two committees, one for the All India Islamic Movement and the other for the establishment of the dreaded terrorist group to carry out the attacks
 isse simi ke ek anya agrani sanghathan-muslim students federation (emf) kaa janm hua, ise ranchi nivasee hidayatulla ne gathit kiya tha
 He is now an NIA witness in the Patna blast case
 nagauri kaa yah bhi daawa he ki usne sampradayik dangon ke dauraan hatyaon kaa vyaktigat rup se badla lene or petrol bamon ke istemaal kaa bhi suzav diya tha, ''esaiem ne jehad ko apana mukhya agenda banaaya or mullah umr ko 'international amir’ mana
 Efforts were made to communicate with Muslim organizations and Muslim countries with similar mindset
 esaiem afghanistan main jehad kii ladaai ladgaye, yahaan tak ki taliban gut ke saath vilay ke liye apane coderon ko bhejne ko taiyaar tha
 Abdul Subhan of SIM was tasked to contact the Taliban's Mullah Omar
 nagauri kaa daawa he, ''maine bhi yuai main rah rahe purv simi adhyaksh sieem bashir se umr se sampark karne ko kaha
 "he says that if there was contact with Omar, his group was ready for 'hijrat' (moving away from the birthplace)
 aisa hone tak pratishodh ke liye hatyaein jari rahengi
 Gradually the training methods also changed
 nagauri kaa kahana he ki usne kai training madul yojit kiye, jahaan vaicharik protsaahan ab bhi sarvopari tha, lekin baad main isamen badlaav kiya gaya
 In 2012, Haider and other members started training in bomb making
 yahaan tak ki usne 'ek jacket bam’ bananaa bhi sikh liya tha jise patna visphot main istemaal kiya janaa tha
 He learned from the Internet how to make it
 shuruaati hamalefaijal se kii gai poochtacha se pataa lagata he ki ranneeti main badlaav kii shuruyaat 2007-08 main hui, jab gut ne hamale karne shuru kar die
 The victims of the attack were not very large but important
 udhaaharan ke taur par:khandwa se bijepi parshad pramod tiwari 2008: nagauri kii giraftaar ke baad faijal or uske saathiyon ne tiwari kii hatya kaa prayaas kiya jo naakaam rahaa
 It claims that Tiwari was involved in riots against Muslims
 faijal kaa poochtacha ke dauraan kahana tha, ''aktubar 2008 main mehboob or amjad ke saath milakar pramod tiwari ko goli maari or vah buree tarah ghayal ho gaya
 "jailor Sanjay Pandey in Satna Jail, 2009: Faizal claims that he planned murder but could not succeed"
 vah pandey kii hatya karnaa chahta tha kyonki indore jail main pandey ne safadar (nagauri) bhai or duusare saathiyon ko bahut tarchar kiya tha
 Havildar Sitaram, Madhya Pradesh ATS, Khandwa, 2009: Another plan for retaliation was made
 faijal kaa kahana he ki is baar vah safal rahaa, ''bakreed ke din ham seetaram ke ghar kii taraf gaye or uskaa peechha karnaa shuru kar diya
 We stopped his bike and shot three shots
 uski maut maukey par hi ho gai
 "shiv Pratap Singh, 2011, Ratlam: This time Faizal entrusted this task to his partner Zakir
 is baar kathith rup se usne singh kii hatya kar di kyonki vah simi sadasyon ke pariwaron se gaali-galouj karata tha
 Bhairoo Lal Tang, local VHP leader, Nagda, Ujjain, 2011: Two SIMI activists - Sharafat and Farhat - were determined to attack Tang
 lekin faijal kaa daawa he ki usne yah jimmaa khud hi le liya, ''main farhat or sharafat se milane nagda gaya
 And shot him the next day
 lekin tang batch gaye
 "it was a failed attempt
 simi or iem: alag rahbharat main kisi aatanki sanghathan ko har tarah kii madad deni ho to simi cader pehali pasand maani jaati he
 Hence IM operatives form friendships with some enthusiastic SIMI members
 udhaaharan ke taur par tahseen akhtar ko 2014 main giraftaar kiya gaya tha, vah iem ke bihar madul main shaamil tha or visphotak visheshgy samaj jaataa tha
 He took shelter in the Ranchi home of Hyder Ali, the main accused in the Patna blast
 ek anya simi kaaryakarta manjar imam ab giraftaar ho chukaa he, usne kathith taur par kai iem aaparatives ko karnataka or kerala main surakshit thikaane talashne main madad kii
 Internet chat records between IM operative Asadullah Akhtar and Yasin Bhatkal and Mirza Shadab Baig provide considerable evidence
 akhtar or bhatkal ko pichley saal giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Mirza Shadab Baig was in Pakistan then
 enie ne akhtar ke laptaap se chat hasil kii, usamen beg azamgarh nivasee akhtar se shaadaab samet simi ke do sadasyon se sampark karne ko kahata he
 He is to be sent to Pakistan for training
 lekin jaisaa haidar ne giraftaar ke baad bataaya, ki simi ne alag hone kaa faisla kiya kyonki yah kathith rup se pakistan kii iesai ke niyantran vaale eliti se kisi tarah sambandh nahin rakhana chahta tha
 Hyder continued to receive the same message from Nagauri that the organization had sought protection from the Taliban and al-qaeda, but Faizal says that when this could not happen, he made contact with other terrorist groups, who are believed to be affiliated with the al-qaeda and the Taliban , Such as the jaish-e-mohammed of Pakistan (JEM)
 2011 main simi ke ek kaaryakarta ejaj ko saudi arab bheja gaya, lekin vah mishan bhi naakaam rahaa
 Faizal says, "we planned to send Ejaz on Hajj so that he could meet the jaish-e-mohammed activists
" jeiem kii website par likhaa he ki haj par jo bhi mujahidin ko qurbaani kii khaal de saktaa he, vah website par die number par sampark kar saktaa he
 i gave this number to Ejaz and asked him to contact JEM
 lekin jeiem ne ejaj par bharosa nahin kiya or use dhaka jane ko kaha
 Ijaz returned and stayed in a hotel in Bangladesh
 ejaj ne jeiem se sampark karne kii koshish kii lekin use china jane ko kaha gaya
 Ijaz could not go there because we did not have money for it
 ”lekin ab tak jin hamalon kii yojana banaai gai or anjaam diya gaya, usase yah spasht ho jaataa he ki desh main hi panpa nayaa gut bahari madad ke bina khatarnaak bhi he or sansadhano se bharpoor bhi
 It is difficult to estimate its number accurately, but investigators say that its operations are spread across 12 states (see graphic)
 iske alaava yah gut yuva chaatro ko nishaanaa banaata he or uddeshyon se parichit karwaata he
 When the module headed by Hyder was busted in Ranchi, the youngest recruit was a minor who allegedly took part in the Bodh Gaya attack
 pratibandh kargar rahaa?aatank ke saae se nae simi kaa udai phir yahi sawaal uthaata he ki kya aise guton par pratibandh un par niyantran main madadgaar hota he yaa ugravadi guton se milane vaale samarthan se majboot hone ke baad pratibandh beasar ho jaataa he
 The investigating agencies impose all the blame on the state governments for not keeping control over the activities of such groups, the second aspect of the argument is that the Center does not have such a system that by collecting news from various states and districts, a big picture of such activities is prepared
 can do
 duusari ore kai simi kaaryakartaaon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale varisht vakil emes khan is tarah ke maamle ujagar karne kii sachaai par hi sawaal uthaate hai, ''agenciyon ne pratibandhon kii aad main bekasoor logon ko giraftaar kar liya
 Their lives are in danger and families are also feeling threatened
 ”institute of conflict management ke ajay saahani alag raay rakhte hai, ''ye pratibandh agenciyon ko group or sanghathanon par niyantran rakhane main madad karte hai
 In simi's case this ban worked
 sanghathan kii sadsyta ko aparaadh maane jane ke baad kai logon ne isse duuri bana lee he
 "but Sahni also believes that" when innocent people are arrested just for being members of SIMI, there is a problem in implementing the law
 ”dilli police ke special kamishnar es
 N
 shrivastav, jin par special cell nirikshan kaa kaarybhaar he or jo is tarah kii poochtacha main shaamil rahe hai, unka maananaa he, ''simi par pratibandh lagane se isaki gaiyr-kanoonee gatividhiyon par niyantran lag gaya he
 "yet for seven years SIMI has evolved from a revolutionary organization into a faction trained in arms
 nagauri ne khulaasa kiya ki uske sahyogiyon ne 2004-05 main hi kai sthaneey thikaane talash liye the
 By then he had started using code names (code names) and started using pseudonyms like Hussain, Mushabir, Safwan, Iqbal and Musab
 is badlaav ko roka nahin ja sakaa
 And it is assumed that if something is showing an effect then it is IM
 yah sab aise daur main ho rahaa tha jab simi par pratibandh laga tha or yah mana ja rahaa tha ki simi kaa dam nikal chukaa he, lekin asal main vah majboot ho rahaa tha
 After preparing its cadre, Simi is now a new member of the world of terror
 nae rup main isaki pahunch badi he or iraade or bhi bade hai
 Controversy has also started with the announcement of Lok Sabha elections
 muslim dharmaguruon ne jahaan ramajaan ke chalate 6 may, 12 may or 19 may ko matdaan par naaraazgi jataai he to vahiin ab madhyapradesh ke bijepi vidhayak ne hindu tyoharon kaa hawala dete hue chunaav ayog se punarvichaar karne kii maang kii he
 Hindu dates should also be kept in mind: BJP MLA Madhya Pradesh BJP State Vice President and BJP MLA Rameshwar Sharma's statement has come out
 'ajtak' se baat karte hue rameshwar sharma ne kaha he ki 'chunaav ayog hindu tithiyon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhe kyonki 6 may se lekar 21 may tak akshay tritiya, buddha poornima or shaadiyon ke shubh muhoort hai jisamen lakhon vot prabhavit honge'
 Rameshwar Sharma has said that 'all political parties sit while fixing the election date and the Congress, SP, who thrash a lot that we are friendly to Muslims, they should have taken care of the dates of Ramadan'
 rameshwar sharma ne kaha ki 'hinduon ke saamne bhi pareshaani he kyonki dekha jaae to 6 or 7 taarikh ko akshay tritiya rahegi
 Millions of marriages take place across the country on Akshaya Tritiya
 shaadi main log jate hai
 If relatives also come, then voting will also be affected
 vahiin 18 or 19 taarikh ko buddha poornima manaai ja rahi he
 This Purnima is such that lakhs of devotees go to bathe on the banks of all the holy rivers and bathe inside the country and polling of 24-24, 48-48 hours will be affected here
 rameshwar sharma ne kaha ki 'unki maangon par nirvachan ayog yadi dhyaan detaa he to hamaari maangon par bhi nirvachan ayog ko khyaal rakhana chahie kyonki jab lakhon shaadiyon main baraat niklegi or log baraat main jaaenge to lakhon voter bhi to idhar se udhar honge'
 The Jamiat Ulema also objected to the Jamiat Ulema Madhya Pradesh on polling dates during the war
 jamiyat ulema ke pradesh adhyaksh haji mohammad haaron ne daawa kiya he ki isse musalamaanon kii voting par asar padegaa
 Talking to 'aaj Tak' Haji Aaron said that the 'election Commission has announced about the election that it is necessary for our Republic of India and we welcome it because elections are held in 5 years
 unhone kaha, 'ramajaan mubarak musalamaanon kii sabase ahm farija he or aamtaur par ramajaan ke maheene main musalamaanon kii dincharya badal jaati he
 He fasts throughout the day and stays till late night in Namaz, Tarabi and Ibadat, Ramadan Sharif had to be taken care of on such an occasion '
 haji haaron ke mutabik 'agar aisa nahin kiya gaya yaa kaarykram tabdeel nahin kiya gaya to musalamaanon kii bahut badi taadaad roje ke andar kamjor ho jaati he
 There are also elders, women too
 naujavaanon par iskaa zyada asar nahin padegaa lekin bujurg or mahilaayein raat main ibaadat kii vajah se din main aaraam karte hai
 At the same time there are long queues inside the election
 koi khaas intjaam kiye jaaen ki rojedaaron ko jaldi se vot karne diya jaae
 If there are people in long queues, the voting percentage will be greatly reduced
 isliye hamaara ellection kamishan se anurodh he ki tarikhon par phir se gaur karen nahin to isse musalamaanon ke voting pratishat par asar padegaa'

 Manna, a master of classical singing, used to bring out beautifully the expressions behind the words with his singing style
 unke samakaleen gayak mohammad rafee or mahendra kapur sahit us samay ke kai mashhoor gayak manna de ke jabardast prashansak the
 His real name was Prabodh Chandra Dey
 pyaar se unhen 'manna da' bhi pukaara jaataa tha
 The singer was born on 1 May 1919 in Calcutta (kolkata)
 inaki maa kaa naam mahamaya or pita kaa naam poornachandra de tha
 He graduated from Vidyasagar College after receiving his early education from Indu Baburpur Pathshala
 vah kushti or mukkebaaji kii pratiyogitaaon main bhi khub bhaag lete the
 His father wanted him to be a lawyer
 magar manna ko to adaalat nahin, adaavat pasand thi
 This well-known singer received his early education in music from his uncle Krishna Chandra Dey
 ek baar jab ustad badal khan or manna de ke chachaa saath main riyaj kar rahe the, tabhi bagal ke kamare main balak manna bhi ga rahe the
 Badal Khan asked Krishna Chandra Dey who is singing it, so he called Manna Dey
 vah unki pratibha pahchaan chuke the or tabhi se manna apane chachaa se sangeet kii talim lene lage
 He trained in Hindustani classical music from Ustad Dabir Khan, Ustad Aman Ali Khan and Ustad Abdul Rahman Khan
 manna de 1940 ke dashak main sangeet ke kshetra main apana mukaam banane ke liye apane chachaa ke saath mumbai aa gaye
 There he worked as an assistant music director first with his uncle, then with Sachin Dev Varman
 pashrv gayak ke rup main manna ne pehali baar film 'tamanna' (1942) ke liye suraiya ke saath gaaya
 However, before that he joined the group anthem in the film 'ram Rajya'
 is film ke bare main dilachasp baat yah he ki yahi ekmaatr film thi, jise mahatma gandhi ne dekhi thi
 For the first time as a solo singer, he was given the opportunity to sing the song 'gayi Tu Gaya Sita Sati' from the film 'ram Rajya' (1943) by composer Shankar Rao Vyas
 unhone 'o prem divaani sanbhal ke chalanaa' (kadambari-1944), 'i duniya jaraa (kamala -1946)', 'hai ye he' (jangal kaa jaanavar 1951),' 'pyaar hua ikraar hua (shri 420-1955), 'ye raat bhigi bhigi' (chori-chori-1956) jaise kai geet gaae, lekin 1961 main ai film 'kabuli vaala' ke geet 'i mere pyaare vatan' ne manna de ko shoharat kii bulandiyon par pahunchaa diya
 Manna Dey was fond of singing difficult songs based on classical music
 'pucho na maine kaise rain bitaai', 'sur naa saje kya gaau main', or 'tu pyaar kaa sagar he teri ek boond ke pyaase ham' jaise geeton ko unhone badi sahajata se gaaya
 Manna Dey was a master of classical music, but Kishore Kumar did not have much classical knowledge of music
 jab film 'padosan' (1968) ke geet 'ek chatur naar badi hoshiyaar' kii recording ho rahi thi, to nirmaataa mahmud ne kaha ki rajendra krishna ne jaisaa yah geet likhaa he, usee tarah halke-phulke tareeke se gaanaa he, lekin manna de nahin maane
 He sang it in his own style
 jab kishor kumaar ne mukhdaa gaaya to manna de ko vah pasand nahin aayaa tha
 As such, this song was recorded
 prasiddh kavi harivansh raay bachchan ne manna de se prabhavit hokar apni amar rachana 'madhushaala' ko gaakar sunaane kaa unhen mauka diya tha
 The last Hindi film to be sung by him was 'umar'

 She received the Filmfare Award for Best Female Singer for the films 'mere Huzoor' (1969), Bangla film 'nishi Padma' (1971) and 'mera Naam Joker' (1970)
 mohammad rafee ne ek baar unke bare main kaha tha, 'aap log mere geet sunate hai, lekin agar mujhase poocha jaae to main kahuunga ki main manna de ke geeton ko hi sunata hum
 ' manna de ne bangla main apni aatmakatha 'jivoner jalasaghore' likhi thi

 After living in Mumbai for more than fifty years, Manna Dey was moving to Kalyan Nagar in Bangalore

 When the song 'ek Chatur Naar Badi Hoshiyar' from the film 'padosan' (1968) was being recorded, producer Mahmood said that the song is light-hearted as Rajendra Krishna wrote the song, but Manna Dey did not agree
 unhone ise apane hi andaaj main gaaya
