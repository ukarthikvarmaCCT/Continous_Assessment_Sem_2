 In the next discussion, there was a debate between Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan and Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi about whether the states get proper financial support from the Center

 P
 joshi kar rahe the
 Chavan said that the Planning Commission should re-review its programs for the states, because "similar schemes for all are not effective even within the states

 Will need more than
 apni ladakpan vaali muskaraahat ke saath chavaan ne kaha, ''ye sirf mumbai kii nahin, rashtriya pariyojnaayen hai
 Gogoi, an equally clever man wearing a beige turtleneck suit, also advocated for his kingdom, claiming that the Northeast cannot be measured on the same scale as the rest of India
 unhone us ilaake kii bhugolic sthiti, aatankwaad or kaamkaaj kii sankshipt avadhi (lambey monsoon ke kaaran vahaan chah maheene hi kaam ho paata he) jaisi samasyaayein gina daaleen
 Joshi descended on this in the form of justifying the argument
 unhone kaha ki centre pehle hi 90:10 ke formule ke aadhaar par purvottar ko paisa de rahaa he
 Gogoi rejected the argument that the role of the government in local problems was still low
 unka kahana tha ki aapadaa raahat ke liye mil rahaa paisa jameen ke kataav kii us samasya main kaam nahin aata, jo assam main bade paimaane par jari he
 Asked about losing the Nano project to Gujarat, Chavan said the Gujarat government had offered 300 percent interest-free loan to the project, which other states cannot afford
 gogoi ne kaha, ''main byaaj mukt karj dekar bade udyogpatiyon ko lubhaana nahin chahta
 The farmers of my state are more in need of interest free loans
 ''manch par or manch se itar bhi maamla congress viruddh bhaajapa or centre viruddh rajyon kaa tha

 -saath main beuro reportein Petrol-diesel prices continue to rise even after the government reduced excise duty
 guuruuvaar ko dilli main ek litre petrol ke liye logon ko 69
 07 have to pay Rs
 vahiin, dijal ke liye 58
 One has to pay Rs 33 per liter
 petrol or dijal kii keemton main lagaataar ho rahi is badhottaree ke liye kachche tel kii badhati keemten jimmedaar hai
 Maybe Rs 2 increase According to a report by Famnibhaskar, petrol and diesel prices may increase by Rs 2 directly after the Gujarat elections
 agar aisa hota he, to sarkaar kii taraf se is baar raahat milane ke asaar kam hai
 Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has expressed concern about the rising prices of petrol and diesel on Wednesday
 haalanki exise duty ghataane ke sawaal par unhone kuch nahin kaha
 Constantly increasing prices of crude oil: Actually the price of crude oil is increasing continuously
 buudhvaar ko yah 65
 Reached $ 70 a barrel
 yah kachche tel kii keemton kaa 30 maheene kaa sabase oonche daam hai
 Talking about Indian basket, crude oil prices 61
 70 dollar prati bairal pahunch gai hai
 This increase in crude oil prices is putting pressure on oil companies
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki gujarat chunaav khatm hone ke baad companiyaan keemton main badi badhotaree kar sakati hai
 The prices are fixed daily
 Let us know that at present, the prices of petrol and diesel increase daily
 is dauraan inaki keemton main 3 se 4 paison kii badhotaree hoti he yaa phir ghatati he
 But the continuous rise in the prices of crude oil is reducing the margins of the oil companies
 is vajah se companiyaan keemten badhaane kaa faisla le sakati hai
 Pressure will be increased on reducing VAT: Central government has reduced excise duty to relieve the rising prices of petrol and diesel
 uske saath hi kuch rajyon ne bhi waite main katautee kii he
 After this continuous increase in crude oil prices, pressure on other states to reduce VAT may also increase

 a team
 
 
 do siyaasi kirdaar
 
 
 And history repeating itself 56 years later
 
 
 tab saal 1963 kaa tha or ab 2019
 
 
 But the story is exactly the same
 
 
 party bhi ek hi- congress
 
 
 And at the center of the whole matter, still the President of the party and the President of the party even today
 
 
 tab plan tha ke
 Kamaraj and today Rahul Gandhi can be seen executing the plan
 
 
 isiilie 23 may ke baad rahul gandhi apane istife ke saath congress main jis tarah ke badlaavon ke raste par bad chale hai use kamraj plan-2 kaha ja rahaa he
 Today on 15 July
 kamraj kii jayanti bhi he or is kaaran is par charchaa jaruri he
 It is in 1963, when the Congress was surrounded by questions after the 1962 China War
 pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru kii aguwai vaali congress sarkaar par vipaksh ke hamale tej ho rahe the
 Elections were about to come
 tab ke
 Kamaraj brought a new plan to revive the Congress
 ise kamraj plan ke naam se janaa gaya
 He suggested that big party leaders resign from their posts in government and invest their energies to revive the Congress
 kya tha kamraj plan?ke
 Kamaraj resigned himself first under this plan
 phir laal bahadur shastri, jagjivan ram, morarji desai tathaa esake patil jaise netaaon ne bhi sarkari pad tyaag die
 6 Congress Ministers and 6 Chief Ministers of Congress relinquished their chair and went to work in the party organization
 isse ek taraf congress sanghathan ko jahaan bade or prabhavi netaa mili vahiin pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ko sarkaar main apni nai team banane kaa mauka bhi mil gaya
 K
 kamraj apane is plan kii badaulat centre kii raajnneeti main itane majboot ho gaye ki pan
 After Nehru's death, his role as kingmaker was to make Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi prime ministers
 vah teen baar congress adhyaksh bhi rahe
 He was awarded the Bharat Ratna in the year 1976
 isi plan par badhate dikh rahe rahul2014 ke baad 2019 ke aam chunaav main bhi congress ko mili karaari haar ke baad rahul gandhi ke
 Looking forward to plan like Kamaraj itself
 23 may ko aae nateezon ke baad haar kii jimmedaari lete hue rahul gandhi ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 After this, there was a spate of resignations of leaders in Congress
 kai pradesh adhyaksh, mahasachiv, sachiv samet tamaam netaa rahul gandhi kaa anusaran karte hue party ke padon se istipha dene lage
 There was a demand in the party to withdraw Rahul's resignation
 lekin rahul gandhi ne saaf kar diya ki ab ve congress adhyaksh bane rahanaa nahin chaahate
 Rahul's 'pain' will become Congress's medicine? But Rahul Gandhi was not satisfied with it either
 25 june ko rahul gandhi media ke saamne aae or kaha ki main ab congress kaa adhyaksh nahin hum
 The party should choose its new president
 rahul ne ye bhi saaf kah diya ki aglaa adhyaksh gandhi parivaar se nahin hona chahie
 Rahul Gandhi made the 4-page letter of his resignation public
 is chitthee main rahul gandhi ne sidhi naaraazgi jataai ki congress ke netaaon ko haar kii jimmedaari leni chahie or ye kaaphi peedaadaayak he ki kai netaaon ne jimmedaari lete hue apane istife nahin die
 Rahul said that now they will fight the people's fight on the road
 rahul kaa dard saamne aayaa
 After that, there was a line of resignations in the party
 ab tak 200 se zyada congress ke padaadhikariyon ne apane istife saunp die hai
 Leaders from all states including UP, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Punjab resigned
 kai netaa ab bhi padon par jame hue hemhaalanki abhi bhi kendriya raajnneeti main shaamil kai netaa apane pad par bane hue hai lekin rahul ke istife ke baad ab unpar bhi dabaav badhata ja rahaa he
 In fact, Rahul Gandhi seems to be moving forward on the Congress rejuvenation plan
 taaki sanghathan ko majboot kar saken
 Assembly elections are due in several states including Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand next year
 usase pehle rahul congress ko nae kalevar main dhaalnaa chaahate hai
 Following the resignation of senior leaders, the party is in a state of nothingness after the resignation of Rahul Gandhi
 haalanki, kai suzav bhi aa rahe hai
 Senior party leader Karan Singh has suggested making the interim party president
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki jab tak koi purnakalik adhyaksh namit nahin hota he, tab tak uttar, dakshin, purv or pashchim ke liye chaar kaaryakari adhyaksh namit kar die jaaen
 But Janardan Dwivedi, who was close to Sonia Gandhi, said that Rahul Gandhi is still technically the Congress president
 unhen istipha dene se pehle apane uttaradhikari kaa naam sujhane ke liye ek samiti kaa gathan karnaa chahie
 Janardan Dwivedi's opinion is clear
 ve raajnneeti main 70 saal kii umr ke baad logon ko sakriy padon se hataane ke pakshdhar hai
 Senior leader Jarnadan Dwivedi's opinion can fill the place of seniors is compatible with Rahul's plan
 rahul gandhi ke istife ke baad zyaadaatar yuva netaaon ne istife die hai
 Jyotiraditya Scindia and Milind Deora also recently resigned following Rahul Gandhi
 lekin party kii nigaah darasal 70 paar netaaon kii jagah yuva netaaon ko sanghathan main aage badhaane par he
 Over 70 leaders, Nazimotilal Vora, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Drs
 manmohan singh, ambika soni, eke antni, mallikarjun khadge, ke
 Leaders like Siddaramaiah, Kamal Nath, Harish Rawat, Tarun Gogoi, Digvijay Singh and Oman Chandy have crossed 70 years
 rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot bhi kamobesh isi umr ke paas hai
 Other senior Congress leaders Bhupendra Singh Hooda, Sushil Kumar Shinde, p
 chidambaram, amarinder singh or kapil sibbal bhi isi umr ke paas hai
 It has to be seen how the party in its new avatar harmonizes senior and youth leaders
 kyonki congress centre main vipaksh main he or kuch hi rajyon main satta main he to aise main party sanghathan main hi netaaon ko jagah di ja sakati he
 But if Rahul Gandhi manages to implement Kamaraj Plan-2, then the country's oldest party Congress will be on the path of connecting itself with the youth of the country with young faces and new thinking

 a PPP leader said, "bilawal was projected as the star campaigner of the PPP because Zardari cannot participate in the election campaign because of being president
 ‚Äô‚Äô unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòbilaval ke bina party logon, khaskar pipipi ke ghor samarthakon ke kii bhaawanaaon ko sparsh nahin kiya ja sakegaa

 It is known all over the world that to take Afghanistan under its control, Pakistan formed an army of religious fanatics called the Taliban
 kehane ko to ye islam ke shuddh rup ko maanate hai lekin sachai yah he ki ye ghor kattarpanthi hai or utane hi krur
 For many years, it was through them that Afghanistan ruled from the background and the ISI played a big role in it
 pakistan ne afghanistan se sate apni simavarti ilaakon main taliban banane kaa kaam kiya or dhire-dhire use sarhad ke paar pahunchaa diya
 The US, which carried out a proxy war with Russia, also gave tremendous support to it and a pro-russian government was removed from Afghanistan to form a government of fundamentalists
 aise hua bhasmasur kaa janm jisane aaj pakistan main khun kii nadiyaan baha di hai
 It has openly challenged the authority of an entire state by carrying out two major attacks in three days in Karachi
 inke alaava har din vahaan chote-mote hamale to hote rahete hai jinamein begunaah maare jate hai
 Today, the Taliban that Pakistan created is killing its citizens
 vahaan insaanon kii jaan kii koi keemat nahin he
 The Taliban have created such an army of suicides in front of which all are looking helpless
 pichley samay navaj sharif kii sarkaar ne unase shanti vaarta kaa prayaas kiya tha lekin talibani shariya kanoon lagu karwaane par ad gaye jo vahaan kii sarkaar ko manjuur nahin he
 The conversation ended there and the two sides stood face to face
 pakistan kii samasya he ki talibaniyon or is tarah kii kattarpanthi takaton ko iesai ke ek dhade kaa samarthan praapt he
 This makes it easier for them to make any kind of attack
 pakistan kii is khufia agency main kattarpanthi bhare pade hai jo majahab ke naam par inkaa samarthan karte hai
 Obviously, it is not easy for the government to deal with them
 pakistan sarkaar main bhi bahut se tatv aise hai jo peeche se itnaa samarthan karte hai
 Then how can a strict policy be made? Now the situation is out of control
 pakistan ek khatarnaak desh main tabdeel ho gaya he
 a country that has been formed for just 66 years has become a victim of anarchy and unending violence
 iskaa bhavishya andhakaarmay ho gaya he
 In a country where there is poverty and illiteracy, religion works as opium
 pakistan ke maamle main bhi aisa hi hua he
 a large number of uneducated people handed over their children to clerics who are sitting in the name of religion, opening a school of fundamentalism
 puure pakistan main kamobesh yahi haalat he
 Terrorism has been promoted in the name of religion
 ab pakistan us aag main jhulas rahaa he
 But burning of Pakistan in this way is equally worrying for us
 jab pados main aag lagi ho to aapkaa ghar kaise surakshit rah saktaa he? bharat ko is ore gaur se dekhnaa hoga taaki vahaan kii lapten yahaan tak na pahunche
 History is witness that the terrorists coming from across the border have attacked many times
 pakistan kaa maamla uskaa apana aantarik maamla he lekin kul milakar yah hamaare liye bhi chintaa kaa vishay he
 We have to keep a close watch on it and strengthen our intelligence system so that we can be alert in time

 The Shiv Sena, an alliance partner of the NDA, which has been opening a front against the BJP and the Narendra Modi government at the Center for some time, has signed seats with the BJP in Maharashtra for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 ab tak maharashtra main apane liye bade bhai kii bhoomika kii ichha rakhane vaali shivasena ko samjhaute ke tahat kul 48 siton main se 23 siten milin, jabaki bijepi 25 siton par chunaav ladegi
 On the other hand, Ramdas Athawale, head of nda's ally at the Center, RPI, has objected to not getting even 1 seat in the alliance
 bijepi-shivasena ke bich gathbandhan kii jaankaree dete hue maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kaha ki hamaare bich vichaaron kaa madbhed rahaa he lekin ham vichaardhaara ke drushtikon se ek duusare se jude hai
 He said that at a time when some people are gathering and targeting those who trust in nationalism, then it becomes the responsibility of the parties that believe in nationalism to become one
 unhone bataaya ki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi-shivasena ke bich gathbandhan tay ho gaya he, jisamen shivasena 23 siton par or bijepi 25 siton par chunaav ladegi
 Ramdas Athawale is unhappy with the NDA ally RPI not getting a single seat in the agreement reached between the bjp-shiv Sena on 48 seats in Maharashtra in the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone party ke liye mumbai kii south-central seat kii maang kii he or kaha he ki yadi arpiai ko seat nahin di gai to hamen gathbandhan ke bare main sochna hoga
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reacting to the Shiv sena-bjp alliance, wrote in a tweet that bjp's alliance with Shiv Sena is beyond politics and motivated by the desire for a strong India
 saath main chunaav ladane kaa faisla endie ko majboot banaata he
 i am confident that our alliance will be the first and only choice of Maharashtra
 Our association with the@shivsenagoes beyond politics
 We are bound by a desire to see a strong and developed India
 The decision to contest together strengthens the NDA significantly
 i am sure our alliance is going to be Maharashtra's first and only choice! - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 18, 2019 PM Modi further wrote in the tweet that inspired by the thoughts of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Bal Thackeray, bjp-shiv Sena alliance of Maharashtra Will continue to work for the welfare of the people and ensure that the state once again elects a representative who is development oriented, corruption free and proud of Indian culture
 Inspired by the vision of Atal Ji and Balasaheb Thackeray Ji, bjp-shiv Sena alliance will continue working for the well-being of Maharashtra and ensuring the state once again elects representatives who are development oriented, non corrupt and proud of India‚Äôs cultural ethos
 - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 18, 2019 Assembly elections in Maharashtra are held only a few months after the Lok Sabha elections, so BJP and Shiv Sena will contest equal seats in the upcoming assembly elections
 devendra fadanvis ne kaha ki shivasena se bijepi kaa rishta 25 saal kaa rahaa he
 But due to some differences in the last assembly elections, the two parties fight separately
 unhone bataaya ki vidhansabha chunaavon main chote dalon ko kuch siten dene ke baad jo bhi siten bachengi wo bijepi or shivasena ke bich baraabar-baraabar bantegi
 Let me tell you that for some time there has been tension in the relationship between BJP and Shiv Sena
 shivasena ne centre kii modi sarkaar samet rajya kii fadanvis sarkaar ko gherne main koi kasar nahin chodi thi
 Be it the Rafale issue or the drought issue in Maharashtra
 pichley dinon dilli main centre sarkaar ke khilaaf chandrababu naidu ke pradarshan main bhi shivasena shaamil hui thi
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray while praising the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme said that our mind is clear
 ham donon dalon ke bich hindutv or ram mandir ke mudde ko lekar gathbandhan hua tha
 He said that we will fight the elections unitedly, if we keep fighting amongst ourselves, then we will hand over power in the hands of those against whom we fought for the last 50 years
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha pichley dinon kuch muddon ko lekar donon dalon ke bich matbhed rahaa lekin ab yah dur ho gaye hai
 Amit Shah said that Shiv Sena and Akali Dal have been the oldest allies of BJP
 shah ne daawa kiya ki bijepi-shivasena kaa gathbandhan maharashtra main kam se kam 45 siten jeetegi

 During the hearing on the ongoing dispute in Karnataka, the Supreme Court has deferred the matter till Tuesday and said that till then the situation remains as it is
 isse pehlebagi vidhayakon kii ore se pesh vakil mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki vidhansabha adhyaksh ne press conference kar kaha ki vidhayakon ko mere paas aana chahie tha unako supreme court ke paas nahin janaa chahie tha
 The speaker said that i have to read the resignations all night
 janata ke prati javabdeh hum
 On behalf of the rebel mlas, it was said that the speaker said yesterday that the Supreme Court cannot give us directions
 spikar ne ye bhi kaha tha ki main pehle istife ko dekhuunga uske baad faisla karuunga or abhi tak koi faisla bhi nahin diya
 It was said on behalf of the rebel mlas that this matter is only for resignation
 baagi public, tivi or court har jagah kah rahe he ki wo istipha dena chaahate hai
 On this, the Chief Justice asked what is the verdict of the speaker, then the rebel mlas were told that nothing has been said on behalf of the speaker so far
 aaj se vidhansabha kaa satr shuru ho rahaa he spikar bas vidhayakon ko ayogy qaraar dene chaahate hai

 Resignation is accepted when the speaker is satisfied according to the said law on behalf of the speaker
 isamen samay lagata he
 The way the petitioners want it to be done immediately is not possible
 pehle ye dekh jaataa he ki istipha sahi he yaa nahin
 On this plea of singhvi, the court asked- Are the speakers challenging the power of the Supreme Court? Singhvi said no
 ham sirf prakriya bataa rahe hai
 Singhvi further said that disqualification proceedings are going on against all the ten mlas

 Advocate Rajiv Dhawan, appearing for Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, said that there are no facts in this petition

 This petition is not hearable

 The legislators say they resigned the governor who sent it to the speaker

 Only the speaker has a role
 dhawan ne aage kaha ki vidhayakon ne daawa kiya he ki wo swechha se apni sadsyta chhod rahe hai
 But his motives are doubtful
 supreme court kaa hi faisla he ki agar spikar ko nijee taur par bhi istife kii soochna mili to spikar kii zimmedaari he ki wo uske peeche ke kaarnon kii jaanch karaae
 The 10th schedule of the constitution gives full details of this process
 iske baad supreme court ne baagi vidhayakon ke vakil mukul rohtagi se poocha ki istife ke alaava ayogyata kaa maamla bhi vichaaradhin he
 The disqualification proceedings of the two mlas began in February
 baaki aath kaa kya hua
 Mukul Rohatgi said that action against two started in February and then stopped

 Ajay Kumar Jha considers two reasons for this trend to develop in children
 pro
 According to Jha, first is that desires are increasing, but the sources of their fulfillment are not growing as fast
 jiske chalate bhatkaav aa jaataa he
 In this case, parents are the easiest victims
 doosraa ki media or teji se badalata parivesh bacchon ko zyada prabhavit kar rahaa he, bacchon kii in jaruraton ko abhibhavak puri nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, they take such a step to adopt a shortcut approach
 yahi nahin, abhibhavakon kaa vyavhaar bhi is sthiti ke liye jimmedaar he
 Without studying the children's state of mind, the parents want to impose their will, but to avoid it, Ladley finds an excuse
 patna kii clinical psychologist dow
 Binda Singh considers this tendency of children as psychosis
 dow
 Binda says, "when this trend develops in children, then they are not able to differentiate between right and wrong
 yah pravriti vanshanugat, manovaigyanik or saamaajik parivesh se panapati he, jiskaa nidaan ghar ke vaataavaran, skulon main counselling or jimmedaari se sambhav he
 There is a need to prepare a frame of difference between right and wrong by treating children friendly
 ''darasal, aarthik jaddojahad main abhibhavak apane bacchon se katate ja rahe hai
 But children have their own circle, which has more impact than parents
 aashcharya nahin ki galat cirkil vaale laadle naitik shiksha ke abhaav main abhibhavakon kii din-raat kii mehnat par pani pher dete hai
 Since the mood of the children is formed by the family and environment, but the addiction of the ladles is getting worse due to parental neglect and degradation

 america ne bhartiya rajanyik devayani khobragade se sambandhit mudde ke samaadhaan kii ummid vyakt kii he, jisase bharat-america ke bich dwipaksheeya sambandhon main ‚Äòaadchan‚Äô aa gai he
 State Department Deputy Spokesperson Mary Hurf expressed hope for a solution to the issue at her regular press conference on Monday
 yah puche jane par ki kya america ko mudde ke sulajhane kii ummid he, harf ne kaha, nishchit taur par
 This reaction of the US has come after India took a more tough stand

 Harf said that the US does not want indo-us relations to be affected by the issue of an Indian diplomat arrested in New York last month in a visa fraud case
 bharat ne america se maafee maangane or devayani par lagaae gaye aaropon ko waapas lene kii maang kii he
 However, the US has insisted that this is a different matter
 harf ne kaha, agar aap puure kshetra kii ore dekhte hai, agar aap afghanistan ko dekhte hai, agar aap urja, aarthik muddon par najar daalate hai, ham log ek saath is par kaam kar rahe hai
 He said, and they are very important and these things cannot be derailed by this incident
 yahi kaaran he ki ham log ek baar phir se is prakriya ko aage badha rahe hai
 We are moving forward keeping this matter aside

 desh bhar main judishal services ke liye hone vaali parikshaon main dilli judishal sarvice exam sabase pratishthit parikshaon main se ek he
 Shipra, a law graduate from Jindal Global Law School, is an IAS officer
 enditivi se baatcheet main shipra ne bataaya ki wo hameshaa se judishal services main janaa chaahatin thim or unhone bas usee ke liye khud ko taiyaar kiya
 She says that she kept preparing for this exam for three consecutive years because the judicial service examination was not being conducted in many states
 dilli jeudicial sarvice exam ke silebus ko shipra ne apni taiyaari ke dauraan kai baar doharaaya or unhen lagata he ki bhale hi aapako ye boring lage par safalataa ke liye ye bahut jaruri he
 Shipra considers "bare acts' understanding and hold on the language very important for this examination
 shipra kaa kahana he ki agar bhashaa par aapkaa acha cmand he to pariksha main aapke uttar baaki logon se alag dikhenge or vahi aapako baaki chaatro se alag karegaa
 Explain that there are three stages of this exam, Pre, Mains and Interview
 pre main adhiktar sawaal 'bear acts' se puche jate hai, jabaki mens main aapaki vishleshan kii kshamta or bhashaa par aapaki pakad kii pariksha lee jaati he
 It is permissible to carry 'bare Acts' in the Mains examination
 isamen ipisi, siarpisi, avidence act, sipisi par aapako khaas dhyaan dena chahie or saath hi kanoonee muddon se jude karant afares par bhi kaaphi dhyaan dena chahie
 Like other professions in the Indian judiciary, there is a shortage of women, whether they are lawyers or judges, whether they are lower courts or upper courts, but Shipra can inspire many youth and especially girls to go to judicial services

 Indian fast bowler Zaheer Khan will not be able to play in the second Test against England starting from Friday in Trentbridge, Sreesanth has been replaced in the team
 vahiin gautam gambhir bhi match main hissaa nahin lenge
 In his place, Yuvraj Singh has been included in the team
 pari kii shuruyaat rahul dravid karenge
 Earlier, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said on Thursday that Zaheer will not play in this match
 pehle test ke dauraan unki dayee jaangh kii mansapeshiyon main khinchaav aa gaya tha
 He is looking to improve a lot and is likely to be fit by the third Test
 gambhir ke maamle main bhi dhoni ne match kii purv sandhya par kah diya tha ki gambhir kaa khelnaa bhi sandigdh he
 We will give him some more time
 yah is par nirbhar karata he ki vah kitna dard sahane ke baavjood khel saktaa he
 Actually, Gambhir was injured on the shot of Matt Prior during the first Test match
 unki dahini kohni par chot lagi thi or mana ja rahaa he ki unki kohni main ab bhi dard he or vah puri tarah feet nahin hai
 India has been struggling with injuries lately and Dhoni said that only rarely did this happen while he was successful in landing his strong team in Test matches
 unhone kaha, hamaari team ko lagaataar is samasya se jujhna padaa he
 Whenever we play, our strongest team does not play
 aisa lagaataar ho rahaa he
 The Indian batsmen scored fewer than 300 runs in both innings at Lord's, but Dhoni hopes to improve a lot in the second Test
 dhoni ne kaha, keval ek ballebaaj ko hi nahin, hamen acchhee saajhedaariyon kii jarurat he
 50 or 100 run partnerships will really help to advance the innings
 unhone kaha, iske saath hi ballebaajon kaa apni acchhee shuruyaat ko bade score main tabdeel karnaa bhi mahatvapurn he
 The lower order batsmen also have to understand the importance of their wicket and if they score 40 to 60 runs too, it will help them a lot
 dhoni ne kaha, hamane pehle aisa kiya he or ham apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karenge
 The Indian captain said that if India wants to dominate the match, it will have to do well in the first innings

 The Indian government has expressed deep disappointment over the abusive behavior of the mother and wife who went to visit Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was jailed in Pakistan, but in the midst of his disappointment, many experts questioned the Indian government's attitude

 At the same time, he advised the government that in future it should not make such a mistake
 duusare desh kii aalochana karne ke bajaae apni ore bhi dekhnaa chahie
 He further said that Pakistan's foreign ministry and government have made many mistakes, but many mistakes have also been done on our behalf
 bharat ko ise halke main nahin liya janaa chahie tha
 We should also look at ourselves, criticizing another country will not work

 He said that in the Jadhav case we have complete proofs and our point should be kept prominently

 In his speech, he did not say anything more concrete than condemning
 shuruyaat main thik tha bharat kaa ravaiyakeke sinha bhi sarkaar ke ravaie se thode naaraaz dikhe, haalanki unhone kaha ki puure cese kii sabase khaas baat yah he ki kulbhushan jadhav abhi jinda he
 He said that on the basis of the report it seems that Jadhav's mental condition is not good
 unako vahaan torchar kiya gaya he
 At the beginning of the case, India said the best thing that Jadhav considered himself a citizen
 use jasusi prakaran main fansaae jane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Then India had also threatened that if something untoward happened to Jadhav, he would be deemed to be murdered
 sinha kaa maananaa he ki bharat ko iskaa badla lenaa chahie
 The solution is not necessarily to be resolved through fighting
 bharat ko usee kii raah par chalate hue aise 20 avasar banane chahie, taaki pakistan par dabaav daalaa ja sake
 Pahwa also said that Pakistan is a sly country and should be treated the same as it is doing to us

 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj while giving a statement in the House claimed that Pakistan had agreed to the meeting due to pressure from India
 lekin pakistan main jadhav kii maa-bivi ke saath apmanjanak vyavhaar kiya gaya
 He said strongly that the country will not tolerate this insult to Pakistan

 On getting information about the visit of Chief Minister Yogi, Allahabad district administration hired 20 coolers from a tent house on Saturday night and got them installed in the ward of the patients, but as soon as Yogi finished the inspection on Sunday, all the coolers were removed

 Coolers were ordered on Saturday

 After launching the portal and app in New Delhi, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said, 'in the ideal situation there should not be a single complaint, but even then if there are about 30 million passengers traveling in more than 10,000 trains, then some complaints may come
 
 ‚Äôunhone kaha, ‚Äòisliye shikaayatein darj karaane ke lihaaj se ek prabhavi madhyam hona chahie
 He said that people can use them in addition to lodging complaints, and also in sending suggestions for improvement in railway services

 While people are standing in long queues for note exchange on the occasion of demonetisation, there are many such shops along the road in Noida's Sector-6 where people are enjoying tea and samosas through Paytm
 dukandaaron kaa kahana he ki notebandi kii vajah se bahut kamlog chaay pineane lage, isi ko dekhte hue unhone smartphone kharida or petm ke jariye logon se paise lene lage
 The shopkeepers say that Modi ji had said that they are not taking any charge for any transaction, so they felt that if they put up Paytm, then no charge will have to be paid on it and the business will also not be affected
 khaas baat ye he ki in dukaanon par graahakon kii sankhyapahale se zyada ho gai he

 India: 3500+ Overseas: 1000 Worldwide total: 4500+ screens # TZH uttar pradesh ke rampur main sadak chaudee karne ko lekar valmiki basti par kii jane vaali karrwai ne raajnneetik rang lenaa shuru kar diya he
 The whole affair started when the homes of the Valmiki families on the encroached land in the center of the city were said to be demolished to build a road leading to the shopping complex
 in logon ko kanshiram awaas yojana ke tahat ghar bhi dene kii baat kahi gai, lekin ye log vahaan janaa nahin chaahate hai, kyonki wo jagah shahar se dur he or yahaan ye pichley 50 saalon se rah rahe hai
 Social activist Shabnam Hashmi visited the place with a delegation
 is team ke sadasyon ne valmiki samaaj ke logon or prashasan se baatcheet kii
 This land belongs to the municipality, on which the people of Valmiki society have been inhabited for 50 years
 prashasnic adhikariyon ne dal ko kaha he ki philhal in logon se ghar khaali nahin karaayaa jaae
 According to Shabnam, after taking stock of the situation on the ground, those people felt that political people were behind all this controversy, who wanted to spoil the atmosphere by creating a hindu-muslim quarrel
 enditivi ko pataa chalaa he ki apni maangon ke saath anshan par baithe logon ko kuch sthaneey netaaon or media ke logon ne bhi uksaane kaa kaam kiya
 These people reportedly said that if you say that you are under pressure to convert, then it will become a political matter and your home will be saved
 dharm parivartan kii baat saamaajik or sampradayik maahaul bigaadane ke liye kuch logon dwaara uthaai gai he
 In fact, the houses which were said to be marked were installed by the municipality 9 months ago, to mark the houses which were built on the municipal land
 duusari taraf musalamaanon ke ghar hai, un par nishaan pehle hi lag chuke the
 At that time there was no mark on the houses of Valmikis due to the strong opposition
 shabnam ne kaha ki ye puri tarah se shahar ke vistaar kii yojana ke tahat kiya ja rahaa he, jisamen hindu or musalmaan donon ke ghar tode gaye hai, aise main is maamle ko jo sampradayik rang dene kii jo koshish kii ja rahi he, wo asaamaajik tatwon dwaara kii gai kuraafaat he
 Those who want to give the matter a communal and religious color at the national level, they are giving them the greed to change religion
 shabnam ke anusaar, ye puraa maamla baithkar prashasan or logon ke bich baatcheet ke zarie sulajhane kii he
 People of Valmiki society said that parking complex is being built here, but after checking this delegation, it was found that the matter is not even that, it is just that the policy of throwing away the poor man who is a poor man is going on Is, which everyone opposes
 is puure abhiyaan ke peeche kii maansikta garibon ko dur phenkane kii he, naa ki unke saath dharm ke naam par bhedbhaav karne kii
 He said that it has been made religious and communal issue by some anti-social and communal elements sitting there
 prashasan agar chaahe to inhen bagair hataae bhi shopping complex tak jane kaa rasta bade aaraam se bana saktaa he, itani jagah he vahaan
 According to Shabnam, "the people of Valmiki society say that the conversion was done by the person who came to mark their house, which would obviously be a small employee
" jisane ye kuraafaat kiya, vah naa to aisa kuch karne ke liye pressure daal saktaa he, naa hi aashwaasan de saktaa he
 He has been complained to the local DM, after which he has also assured to take action against him

 kapoor) on Jan 13, 2017 at 2:23am PST The desire to win by riding on a bicycle cost the Congress dearly
 samaajawaadee party ne 191 ummidavaaron kii list jari kar congress kii mushkilen badha di hai
 The Congress was strong in many seats in districts like Saharanpur, Ghaziabad, Noida, Bulandshahr and Mathura
 inamen se kai siton par congress ke apane vidhayak bhi the
 The Samajwadi Party spoiled the game but now the Samajwadi Party has fielded candidates in many seats from where the Congress could have hoped to win
 ye faisla itani der ye aayaa he ki ab congress ke paas koi khaas vikalp nahin hai
 To say that the party can still field candidates on such seats, but now they will neither have the same enthusiasm nor the public will show special warmth about them
 le dubi jaldbaaziek or jahaan akhilesh yadav ne apane pita kii hi tarah chaunkaane vaala siyaasi daanv khelkar congress ko chitt kiya
 On the other hand, the current masters of the Congress did not consider it necessary to take the precaution that Sonia Gandhi had been showing for two decades about the Samajwadi Party
 sonia gandhi ne ye kai maukon par sunishchit kiya he ki yaa to congress samaajawaadee party se koi rishta nahin rakhegi yaa phir gathbandhan kii sharten wo khud tay karengi
 Bajikangres lost their hands and started the campaign for UP elections with the slogan '27 years, UP Behala'
 rahul gandhi ek maheene tak gaanv-gaanv ghume or kisaanon se karj maafee kaa vaayada kiya
 His visit caught the attention of many local leaders who were not getting the importance of other parties
 saath hi sust pade congressi kaaryakarta bhi harakat main aane lage the
 But as soon as it seemed that some life could be burnt in the party, the talk of an alliance with Akhilesh Yadav started being frowned upon within the party
 party ne is gathjod ke virdohi nirmal khatri ko pradeshdhyaksh ke ohade se hataakar puraane samaajawaadee raaj babbar ko kaman saunp di
 The revenge of the Congress Karnadhars Manasiyasi Pandit believes that after initial hard work, Prashant Kishore, who is commanding the party's election campaign, was seen leaning towards the alliance
 kuch aisa hi raaj babbar or gulam nabi aaazaad ke bare main bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 The pressure of these people proved to be important in persuading Rahul Gandhi for this alliance
 jis din prashanth kishor lambii car se mulaayam singh ke dilli vaale ghar se baahar nikalate dikhe, usee din se congressiyon ke hausale post padane lage
 As the elections approached, the Congress and the public assumed that an alliance was taking place
 aise main tamaam congress pratyaashee or kaaryakarta ghar baith gaye
 Only Congressmen who were expecting tickets were happy
 ab nahin mil rahe netapahle har chunaav se pehle congress ko janaadhar vaale aise kuch log mil jate the jo jo baaki partiyon se niraash hote the
 Because of these people, the Congress was able to win 25-30 seats for the last two and a half decades
 gathbandhan ke kayaason kaa sabase bada nuksaan ye hua ki is dfa congress ko aise netaa nahin mil paa rahe
 Even if this effect ends here, there was a lot of respect
 lekin upi chunaav ko agle aam chunaav kaa semifinal mana ja rahaa he
 The thousands of people who were given tickets by Prashant Kishore's team would now think several times before joining the Congress in 2019
 jamini ladaai chhodkar kiraye kii kokh ke moh main fansi congress uttar pradesh main bahut bada gachha kha gai he
 Justice Markandey Katju, President of the Press Council of India claimed that the people of India vote like sheep
 katju ne yah bhi kaha ki vah chunaavon main matdaan nahin karenge kyonki aisi sthiti main yah ‚Äòarthhin‚Äô he, jab loktantr ko saamanton ne agava kar liya ho
 Talking to 'headlines Today', Katju said that 90 per cent of Indians vote in flocks like sheep
 ve bhedon ke jhund kii tarah hai jo jati or dharm ke aadhaar par matdaan karte hai
 This is a bitter truth and since the people of India vote like livestock, there are so many criminals in Parliament
 katju kii apil, sanjay dutt ko mili maafiunhone kaha ki main matdaan nahin karuunga kyonki meraa mat arthhin he
 Our democracy is still going through a transition period and the feudals have abducted it
 jat, musalmaan, yadav yaa harijan ke naam dekhakar matdaan kiye jate hai
 Democracy is not meant to run like this
 mere ek vot se koi fark nahin padegaa
 Why should i waste my time by joining the herd of animals? Former Supreme Court judge Katju said that even the elite people of society like lawyers and professors vote on caste basis and they did so in Allahabad Bar and University have seen
 jetali ko raajnneeti se sanyas le lenaa chahie: katjuunhone kaha ki main purnroopen dharmanirpeksh vyakti hum or dharmanirpeksh hone par yadi mujhe congressjan qaraar diya jaataa he to aap aisa drushtikon rakhane ke liye swatantra hai
 i am against communal forces

 com 17 july yani somvaar se sansad kaa monsoon satr shuru ho rahaa he
 Votes will be cast for the presidential election on the very first day of the session
 is satr main kisaanon par firing, notebandi, jiesti samet kai aise mudde hai jisapar vipaksh sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish karegaa
 This session of Parliament is expected to be very rude
 vipakshi netaaon ke khilaaf jaanch or sibiai-idi ke chhaapon kaa mudda bhi chaaya rah saktaa he
 In the Narada scam, cases against Trinamool Congress leaders and the family members of former finance minister p Chidambaram and family of RJD chief Lalu Prasad were raided
 iske liye vipaksh ne modi sarkaar par badale kii karrwai kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Many issues may remain in this session
 1
 Firing on farmers: During the last months of the farmers' agitation in Madhya Pradesh, the issue of police firing may be the biggest shadow in this session
 rahul gandhi ne madhya pradesh kaa daura kar kisaanon par firing kaa mudda uchhaala tha
 All parties, including the Congress, have accused the farmers of neglecting the interests of farmers in Modi's rule
 2
 There is a possibility of a lot of uproar over the GST GST
 1 july ko aadhi raat ko bhavy samaaroh main modi sarkaar ne jiesti launch kiya tha or ise desh main sabase bada aarthik sudhaar bataaya tha
 The event was boycotted by several opposition parties, including the Congress
 vipaksh kaa aarope he ki modi sarkaar ne bina taiyaari ke jiesti lagu kiya or isamen aam logon or kaarobaariyon ke hiton kaa khyaal nahin rakhaa gaya he
 There may be uproar in the Parliament regarding this issue
 3
 After demonetisation, the counting of notes continued, two days ago, RBI Governor Urjit Patel appeared before the Parliamentary Committee
 notebandi ke aankadon ko pesh karne kii bajaay unhone kaha tha ki abhi puraane noton kii ginati jari he
 On this, Rahul Gandhi also took a dig at the Modi government on social media
 is mudde ko bhi vipaksh sansad main oochaalnaa chahega
 The opposition alleges that the demonetisation decision of the Modi government caused a huge loss to the common people
 4
 The Amarnath attack and the challenge of terrorism may also overshadow the issue of terror attacks and Kashmir in this session of Parliament
 amarnath yatriyon par hue hamale ko lekar congress ne suraksha vyavstha or modi sarkaar kii kashmir niti par sawaal khadey kiye the
 Opposition in Parliament can surround the government
 5
 Tension on China border The ruling parties and opposition are also face to face with increasing tension on China border
 haal main rahul gandhi kii chini rajdoot se mulaakaat kii khabar ko lekar bhi aarope-pratyarope chale the
 Even when Sushma Swaraj and Rajnath Singh called an all-party meeting on the China issue, the Congress said that the government is just pretending to take the opinion of the opposition in Parliament to defend itself

 The farmer named Jitendra sitting on the dharna said that he has neither received the payment of sugarcane last year nor this year
 unhone bataaya ki kisaanon kaa 80 karod rupee atka padaa he
 They say that we do not want to violate the order of the court, so we are waiving the 14-day payment and want the remaining amount to be paid to us
 jitendra ne bataaya ki adhikari dharna sthal par aae or kaha ki 7 karod rupee jo is saal ke ganne kii bhugtan raashi he wo le lijie or dharna khatm kiijie

 After the letter was leaked in the media, Safairahul questioned how the letter written by Parrikar was leaked in the media before reaching him
 rahul gandhi ne baaten tab kahi hai jab vivaad bad gaya or un par sawaal uthne lage
 Rahul said that he did not mention what happened during the meeting
 rahul ne yahaan tak kaha ki parrikar apni party ke dabaav main hai, isliye wo aisi baaten kar rahe hai
 The meeting was completely personal and sympathetic
