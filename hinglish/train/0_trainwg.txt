 input- bhashaa When i spoke to Raju Koli over the phone, it was not known whether he himself was blind or represented by some blind students
 main darasal netraheen logon ke paidal chalane main aane vaali dikkaton ke bare main kisi se baat karnaa chahta tha
 But when Raju said on the phone that i come to your office
 raju ke confidence se main sanshay main pad gaya
 But then i said that no i come and i reached Sadiq Nagar near his hostel
 kuch der ke baad maine raju coli ko ek raste se baahar nikalate dekha
 Thick hair, shaved face and bag on shoulder and white stick in hand
 aatmavishvaas ke saath raste ko bhaanpate, raju aage badhata aa rahaa tha
 Many times we use this jumla in conversation, i can understand
 khaaskar angrezi main- ai anderstand
 But at times i felt how superficial this jumla is when i walked away with Raju
 viklangon ko dikkat aati he sadakon par ye main jaanata to tha, lekin samajhataa kitna kam tha tab pataa chalaa
 My camerapers were walking upside down with Zubair camera and i was going ahead talking with Raju
 unke saath aadhe kilometre chal kar hi pataa chal gaya ki unhen kisi dikkaton se do-chaar hona padataa he
 There are no sideways on the side of the roads, where there are sideways, there are vehicles standing on them and where the sidewalks were empty, what should be the height of the top, the pits in the middle and not the boards on the sidewalk which were placed for advertisements
 Huh
 raju ne bataaya ki kaise in board se takaraa kar uskaa cheharaa chalni ho gaya tha
 How the blind are afraid of coming to the streets for fear of these paths
 or sochie agar koi wheelchair par ho to uskaa aise raaston par kya hoga? yah sab sunakar saafe hota gaya ki kyon hamaari sadakon par ham viklangon ko itnaa kam dekhte hai
 We have pushed them off the streets
 agar aap soch rahe hai ki hamane keval viklangon ko hi dhakiyaaya, dutkaara he to aap phir galat hai
 We have evicted every pedestrian from the streets of India
 shahari vikaas mantralay ke ek survey ke mutabik har din desh kii lagbhag 30 fisadi aabaadi apane rose kaa safar paidal tay karti he or har saal sadak haadason me marane vaale logon main se 10 fisadi paidal yatri hi hote hai
 However, this figure is also a 2008 survey
 itnaa khoja lekin 8 saal puraane survey ke alaava koi aadhikarik jaankaree kahin nahin mili
 Pedestrians and bicycles are said to be the most unsafe road user in terms of transportation
 infrastracchar, signal free sadakon or expresve kii divaani sarkarein or hamaare urban planar ne apni sabhi planning main paidal logon ko aise gaayab kar diya he jaise ye hamaare desh kii aabaadi hai hi nahin
 The expressway from Delhi to Gurgaon is a good example
 28 kilometre kaa world class haive, asia kaa sabase bada 32 len vaala toll plaza or paidal logon ke liye? kuch nahin
 Think that the way in which more than a dozen villages have been divided, whose people will not be walking? ek report bataati he ki har din dedh lakh log ise paar karte hai
 But what does this mean for highway companies? nateeja pichley do saal main is raste par 111 paidal logon kii maut
 But have only the governments and urban planners' eviction evicted the pedestrians from the streets? No
 ham or aap jaise logon ne bhi kiya he
 Whose car, motorcycle does not like to stop for anyone

 Keep footsteps on the ground as well and feel how those who do not move their feet feel

 rahul ke is naye elaan se upi congress main tikat ke daavedaaron ke paseene chhot rahe hai
 But if the declaration is by Rahul, then it will have to be implemented
 kya he elaandarasal rahul ne uttarapradesh congressko likhit nirdesh jari karte hue kaha he ki jin logon ne tikat ke liye aavedan kiya he, unamem se har ek ko 10 hajaar gharon main kisaan karj maaf, bijli bill maaf or nunatam mulya kaa hisaab karo vaala form dena hoga
 Missed calls and video recordings also have to be kept as evidence
 form bharne vaale kii congress ko vot dene kii sahmati to hogi hi, to form bharne vaale se kisaan kaa karj maaf, bijli kaa bill maaf or sahi nunatam samarthan mulya kaa congress kaa likhit vaada hoga
 This work should be completed by the end of Rahul's farmer journey
 top 3 main nahin aae to samajhie tikat katamaamle ko gambhirtha se lete huerahulne ye bhi do took kah diya he ki har vidhansabha se jo pehle teen pratyaashee 10 hajaar form bhar denge, vahi tikat ke daavedaar ho jaaenge
 The ticket will be given to one of them later and the rest should know that they will not get the ticket

 Rahul will tell them in this meeting that only one of you will get a Congress ticket

 To get the debt waiver form of Congress to 3 crore houses, if the hard work of Motkhat Chaupal is not lost, then the target of this plan of Rahul and Team PK is that they can reach around 3 crore houses through Khat Chaupal and loan waiver form
 darasal, shuruyaat main kareeb 9 hajaar logon ke tikat le liye aavedan kiya tha, un sabhi se booth ke lihaaj se list maangi gayi thi, jisamen 5 hajaar kii khud hi chantni ho gai

 In the model test paper, Gandhiji told Kubuddhistifai that Gandhi was printed in place of Gambling, the controversy over Nathuram Godse, the killer of Ghatma Gandhi, has not stopped yet that a department of Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh has described Mahatma Gandhi as 'evil' 
 haalanki bhale hi ye ek chook he lekin isapar ab vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 Actually, the school education department of Madhya Pradesh has made a big mistake in the model test paper printed for class 10 students this year
 is model test paper main ek sawaal poocha gaya he ki 'subuddhi or kubuddhi kii visheshtaayen kya thim
 Controversy has arisen over what has been written in response to this
 is sawaal ke jawaab main likhaa gaya he 'subuddhi ek eemaandaar vyakti tha or acchhee jindagi jeeta tha
 It is further written that Kubuddhi had many abes and lived life like Voshabari and Gandhiji
 gandhi ji ke bare main aisi baaten likhane kii jab jaankaree saarvajanik hui to hadacamp much gaya
 It was later clarified that instead of 'gambling', 'gandhiji' was printed, which went unnoticed
 model paper main galat chapa gandhi ji kaa namavahin maamla saamne aane ke baad schuli shiksha mantri se jab 'ajtak' ne baat kii to unhone sweekaar kiya ki 'kaksha 10 ve ke model testapaper main printing kii galati hui he
 We will get it investigated and take strict action against the guilty officer
 gandhiji is desh ke naa keval rashtrapita hai balki ham sabake adarsh hai
 Accidentally writing such things about them is nothing short of crime

 He said this while expressing grief over the incident of the death of 22 children from mid-day meal in Bihar

 The LJP chief has demanded the resignation of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar following the incident

 It is worth mentioning that the children of primary school of Gandaman village in Chhapra were fed pulses, rice and vegetables under mid-day meal

 Poisonous food killed many children

 dilli main gaiyr congressi or gaiyr bhaajapai 11 partiyon ke netaa aaj ek manch par ekajute hue or khud ko in donon dalon kaa vaastavik vikalp qaraar diya
 However, during this time he appeared to be avoiding the issue of the post of Prime Minister, which has been a difficult issue for the Third Front in the past
 is morche main chaaron vam dalon ke alaava nitish kumaar kii jediu, naveen patnayak kii bijedy, jayalalita kii ediemke, jedies, samaajawaadee party, assam gana parishad, jharkhand vikaas morcha or punjab main manpreet badal kii aguwai vaali punjab pipuls party shaamil hai
 During this, CPI (M) General Secretary Prakash Karat said that the country needs an alternative to Congress, but it cannot be BJP, because there is no significant difference between BJP and Congress, so we will give 11 parties a choice
 is elaan ke vakt manch par samaajawaadee party ke mulaayam singh yadav, jedy (es) ke echdi devegoda or jedy (you) ke sharad yadav bhi maujuud the
 Prakash Karat said, 'narendra Modi will have to stop coming to power at any cost
 ham sab milakar kaam karenge
 ' vahiin sharad yadav ne kaha, 'yah third nahin, balki first front he
 We have never had any quarrel, we have elected the Prime Minister thrice
 ' third front ke netaaon ne kaha ki pradhanmantri koun banegaa, iskaa faisla chunaav ke baad hoga
 During this time he also released a shared manifesto
 haalanki is morche mangalvaar kii hui is pehali baithak main hi isaki ekajutata par sawaal uthte dikhaai die, jahaan naveen patnayak kii biju janata dal (bijedy) or assam gana parishad (aegypi) ke netaa manch se nadaarad dikhe
 Replying to the questions raised about this, Prakash Karat said, 'AJP President Prafulla Kumar Mahanta's mother is seriously ill, but she has called us and asked us to move forward
 vahiin patnayak ne hamen suchit kiya ki unka pehle se kuch tay kaarykram tha, isliye vah isamen shirkat nahin kar saken
 ' is baithak main shaamil hone vaale netao kaa maananaa he ki desh ko ab gaiyr-congressi or gaiyr-bhaajapai sarkaar kii jarurat he or aane vaale loksabhaa chunaavon main is morche kii sarkaar bananaa tay he
 At the same time, these leaders said that there are other parties too, which may join this front soon
 aisa koun hoga jisane bachapan main diwali par wo kaali tikia naa jalaai ho jisase ‘saanp’ nikalataa he
 You will be surprised if you know the reality of this snake cake
 is ek choti si tikia ko jalaane se 465 cigarette ke dhuen jaisaa pradooshan hota he
 The Pune-based Chest Research Foundation researched the smoke and other emissions from firecrackers when shocking facts emerged
 vaigyanikon ne diwali par chah sabase zyada prachlit pataakhon se nikalne vaale utsarjan kii gananaa kii or phir isaki tulana cigarette se hone vaale nuksaan se kii
 Apart from snakebite, 1000 crackers are 277 cigarettes from a thread, 208 cigarettes from pul-pul (hunter), 68 cigarettes from Phuljari, 68 cigarettes from Chakri and 34 cigarette smoke from pomegranate
 ye adhyayan 2016 main pune uniwarsity ke interdiciplinary skool of health sciensej ke sahyog se kiya gaya
 Particulate matter from these firecrackers was considered to be 200 to 2000 times more harmful than the safe limit
 chest research foundation ke diarector dow sandip salvi ne india today ko bataaya, “phuljhadi, pul-pul yaa saanp kii tikia ke maamle main inhen jalaane vaala inke bahut kareeb hota he
 Pomegranate causes pollution of 5000 micro grams per cubic meter of particulate matter while the safe limit is 50 micro grams per cubic meter i
e
 1000 times more pollution
 ”india today ne doctoron or visheshgyon se is adhyayan ke nishkarshon ko lekar baat kii
 According to doctors, the damage done to body parts by firecrackers cannot be compensated
 apollo hospitals se jude bal rog visheshgy dow anupam sibbal ne kaha, ‘pichley saal diwali par bahut kharaab sthiti rahi
 The children brought complaints of sore throat, cough, sneezing
 kuch ko to saans lenaa hi baari ho rahaa tha
 Seeing children in such condition causes great pain
 ’supreme court pataakhon se hone vaale nuksaan ke akalan ke liye kendriya pradooshan niyantran board (CPCB) ke aankadon par nirbhar karata he
 According to the cpcb's counsel in the Supreme Court, most retail crackers who sell them do not even have a valid license
 CPCB ke vakil vijay panjavaani kehete hai, dilli main pataakhe bechney ke liye 1000 se bhi kam licensadhari hai
 All others sell firecrackers illegally, let us know that under the Indian Explosives Act, it is necessary to get a license from Delhi Police to sell firecrackers
 pataakhaa jalaane ko beshak bacchon kaa khel mana jaataa ho lekin ye nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki aapkaa saamana bahut khatarnaak jahrile rasayan se hota he
 After the Supreme Court's decision, many types of debate are being seen
 visheshgyon kaa aarope he ki CPCB ne pataakhon se vaayu main chode ja sakane vaale rasayanon or vifaille tatwon kii surakshit maatra ko lekar koi maanak yaa seemaa tay nahin kii hai
 This simply means that for so many years, the firecracker industry had an arbitrary exemption of pollution

 agra ke kuch kooda binane waalon kaa dharm parivartan hua to sansad tak main mudda uth gaya
 
 
 Everyone looked upset
 
 
 poochne lage, aisa hua kaise
 
 
 By plotting greed and coercion, land of intrigue was prepared
 
 
 lekin ahm sawaal to yah he ki agar in kooda binane waalon kaa dharm parivartan nahin hua hota to kya unke bare main kisi ne sansad main awaz uthaai hoti
 
 
 Would anyone have expressed concern over his condition? 
 
 chintaa us vyavastha ko lekar honi chahie, jahaan logon kii pareshaaniyon kaa alam yah he ki behatar zindagi kaa laalach dekar koi unka dharm tak badalawa detaa he
 
 
 If someone can be forced to change religion in the name of making an Aadhaar card or ration card, then the concern should be more about changing the system than religion, without which it cannot be stopped
 
 
 ve musalmaan rahakar bhi kooda binte the, hindu hokar bhi vahi karenge, or mujhe puri ummid he ki unamem se zyaadaatar gaiyr-padhe-likhe honge, yani na unhone quran padhi hogi ki yah tay kar paaen ki islam main kya kamiyaan hai, jisaki vajah se unka islam se mohabhang hua ho or na gita padhi hogi taaki yah jaan paaen ki hindu banakar unhen kya behatar hasil ho jayega
 
 
 Meaning, they did not change religion, changed the way towards changing life
 
 
 us mulk main, jahaan kuch rajyon main dharm parivartan rokane ke liye kanoon tak hon, vahaan bhi agar kisi ko daraakar dharm parivartan karne par majaboor kar diya jaataa he, tab bhi mudda vyavastha parivartan kaa he
 
 
 Why state governments are unable to provide protection to those who are forced to convert
 
 
 kerala ke mukhyamantri rahe omen chandi ke die ek aankade ke mutabik kerala main varsh 2006 se 2012 ke bich 7,713 logon ne dharm parivartan kiya or islam apanaaya
 
 
 Even then Hindu organizations had forcibly accused of conversion, and accused the state government of turning a blind eye to everything
 
 
 lekin ek sach yah bhi he ki dharm parivartan karne vaale zyaadaatar ve log hai, jo samaaj ke us hisse se aate hai, jo nazarandaaz kiye jate rahe hai or un par nazar padati bhi he to tab, jab maamla dharm parivartan se jud jaae
 
 
 Religion can tell the way to live life, but to provide the basic facilities to live, religion has to be followed by governments and political parties
 
 
 or jab tak is masale par sirf raajnneeti hoti rahegi or partiyaan rajdharm nibhaane se chookti rahengin, tab tak yun hi laalach or dar ke naam par dharm parivartan hota rahegaa
 
 
 If you want to stop converting, you have to change the system

 Only two countries do not become one by accepting or having similar religious traditions
 nepal ko lekar kai baar saamaanya bharatiyon main aisa bhram ho jaataa he
 Despite this, many of your relatives, including your anchor, went to Nepal to work and remained there
 hamaare gaanv main jab jyotish haath kii lakiron ko dekhakar jhatak detaa tha ki videsh yatra kaa yoga he hi nahin he to haath dikhaane vaala maayoos hokar last tri martha tha
 Even Nepal will not be able to go
 kathmandu, virganj, raksol, aaj bhi na jane kitne bihariyon ke liye landan, paris or neuyark kii kasak puri karne ke thikaane hai
 Whenever we look at the Himalayas, we forget that Nepal has the right over its parts
 mount everest kii oonchaaiyon ko meter centimetre main ratate ratate yaad hi nahin rahata ki yah bharat main nahin nepal main he
 Pashupati Nath Temple is not just a location for us in Devanand and Zeenat Aman's film Hare Rama Hare Krishna, but it is part of Nepal's culture
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad narendra modi november 2014 main nepal yatra par gaye to pashupati nath mandir main bhavy swaagat hua
 There he offered 2500 kg of sandalwood
 pradhanmantri ne visitor book main likhaa tha ki jo pashupati nath hai wo bharat or nepal ko jodate hai, main prarthana karata hum ki ve donon deshon par apni krupa rakhenge
 The Prime Minister rightly wrote that Pashupati Nath connects India and Nepal, but in the zeal of righteousness, a problem arises when many people start claiming Nepal in the name of this association
 pradhanmantri kii yatra ke nau maheene baad unheen kii party ke saansad yogi adityanath kis haq se nepal ke pradhanmantri susheel koirala or samvidhan sabha ko patr likhte hai ki nepal ko phir se hindu raashtra ghoshit karnaa chahie
 According to the Times of India report, he also makes such a demand by attending a function in Kathmandu on 26 July
 lekin, hindu bahul raashtra nepal ne hindu raashtra kaa prastaav thukraa diya
 In the Constituent Assembly of 601 members, when two-thirds of the members voted against the Hindu nation's resolution
 yogi adityanath ab kya karenge maaloom nahin lekin ravivaar ko lagu hue samvidhan ko lekar bharat ko kya karnaa chahie uske saamne ek gambhir sankat khadaa ho gaya he
 The reaction of India has angered a section of the people of Nepal
 aap jaanate hai madhesi or janajati samvidhan ke kai praavdhaanon se naaraaz hai
 Madhesis, who have social connections to most of Bihar's regions, feel that the new constitution has not found representation and that many rights have been limited
 ek bhi madhesi pratinidhi ne samvidhan ke praaroop par dastakhat nahin kiya or tarai ilaakon main hinsa bhadak uthi jisamen chalis logon ke maare jane kii khabar ai he
 Madhesis also looked towards Delhi and Delhi too did not disappoint, sending Foreign Secretary s Jaishankar to Kathmandu for two days
 jaishankar ne vahaan jaakar sabhi raajnneetik dalon se mulaakaat kii lekin nepal ne vahi kiya jo use thik lagata he
 Did not listen to India
 nepal ke samvidhan ko lekar jahaan china ne garmjoshi se swaagat kiya he bharat ne chintaa jataai he or kaha he ki iskaa dayera vyapak hona chahie
 According to newspaper reports, India has demanded seven major changes from Nepal to allay the concerns of Madhesis and tribes and openly accept the new constitution
 bharat ne kaha he ki ye sunishchit kiya jaae ki madhesiyon ko unki aabaadi ke hisaab se sansad main pratinidhitiv mili
 Article 21 of the constitution was said to give fair representation to Madhesis
 nae samvidhan main yathochit shabd hataa diya gaya he
 India wants the word to be added again
 samvidhan kii dhara 283 main ye praavdhaan he ki nepal ke sheersh padon jaise raashtrapati, uparashtrapati, pradhanmantri, mukhya nyaayadhish, sansad ke spikar jaise bade padon par keval nepalavanshi hi baith sakate hai
 
 
 This means that citizens who take citizenship of Nepal by birth or become naturalized Madhesi will never reach higher positions
 
 
 bharat ne isamen bhi sanshodhan kii maang kii he
 
 
 The fourth demand is that Section 11 (6) provides that foreign women should apply separately for Nepal citizenship if they are married to a Nepali citizen
 
 
 yah madhesiyon ke kilaaf he
 
 
 Madhesi wants that there should be a natural provision of giving Nepal citizenship upon marriage
 
 
 
 It is true that not a single Madhesi or Tribe representative in the Constituent Assembly has signed the draft of the Constitution
 bharat kaa kahana he ki samvidhan banane kii prakriya ke dauraan bharat samaveshi or sabko pratinidhitiv dene kii baat kaa samarthan karata rahaa he
 s Jaishankar, who became the messenger of the Prime Minister, also met the President and the Prime Minister but nothing happened
 samvidhan lagu hone par jab bharat ne kaha ki usne notice main liya he to nepal kii janata bhadak gai
 According to the Nepal newspaper Kathmandu Post, students of Ratna Rajya Campus have demonstrated against India on Wednesday
 postaron par baikaaaf india likhaa hua tha
 According to a BBC report, on Tuesday, people tweeted # backoffindia by tweeting about 1,80,000 tweets
 10,000 se adhik twit main pradhanmantri modi ko sambodhit karte hue kaha gaya he ki nepal ke aantarik maamalon main dakhal na den
 The hashtag growupmodi also started trending
 kai logon ne twit kiya ki unka gussa bharat kii janata se nahin he
 From the government's point of view
 bukamp ke dauraan jab hindustani media ne nepal ko bharat kii madad kaa had se zyada gunagaan karnaa shuru kiya tha tab bhi isi tarah kaa pratikar hua tha
 The hashtag Go Home started trending on Indian media on Twitter
 november main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki nepal or bharat kaa sambandh himalay or ganga jitna purana he
 From where i am chosen in Kashi there are priests from Nepal and priests from India in Pashupati Nath temple
 donon desh ke bich kitna parsparik sambandh hai
 Even after these demonstrations, it seems that the youth of Nepal do not see India as having religious ties, but rather see themselves as citizens of an independent nation
 wo bharat kii har dakhlandaazi ko atikaraman maanata he na ki dharmik karmkand
 17 years of talk are undergoing a new examination of the new kind of historicity established by the visit of an Indian Prime Minister
 nepal kii samvidhan sabha main bolte hue pradhanmantri modi ne jor dekar kaha tha ki hamaara kaam nepal ke kaam main dankhalandaazi karne kaa nahin he balki jo bhi rasta aap chunate hai uskaa samarthan karnaa he
 Did India do this? kya bharat ne media ke zariye saat maangon ko jari kar chook kii he
 It is not that we start looking at Nepal through the prism of too many religious traditions, whereas Nepal likes to see itself as a secular republic by ridding itself of religious elements like Hindu nation

 Fogging the camera does not deter the leader from even taking the broom, but no one cares about the people of Delhi who are sick due to mosquito sting as soon as the camera is closed

 bhartiya team ne champions trophy ke puure toornament main lagaataar acha pradarshan kiya tha, vahiin ummid lagaai ja rahi thi ki team india final mukaable main bhi pakistan ko haraakar itihaas rachegi
 But this could not happen
 jiske baad ab kai tarah ke sawaal uth rahe hai
 There are other questions that arise because no cricket fan expected such a performance from Team India
 champions trophy se pehle hi team ko lekar kai tarah kii khabaren ain thi, jisamen captain or coach ke bich sabakuch thik nahin bataaya ja rahaa tha
 After all, why was there no plan B? It was also seen in the final match
 pakistan team shuru se hi match main haaavee rahi, pehle ballebaajon ne bhartiya gendbaajon kaa pani pilaayaa to phir baad main bhartiya ballebaaj bhi kuch khaas nahin kar sake
 It seemed that Team India does not have any plan 'B'
 ballebaaj lagaataar beet ho rahe the, lekin phir bhi shot khilne kii koshish main out ho rahe the
 The same happened with the bowlers as well, the team had to bear the brunt of making frequent changes during bowling
 karaari haar ke baad team india ne shandaar khel bhaavana, ICC ne bhi kiya salamatoornament se pehle hi tha man-mutavadarasal, toornament shuru hone se pehle hi aisi khabaren aa rahi thi ki captain viraat kohli or coach anil kumble main sabakuch thik nahin he
 It was being said that many players have also complained about Kumble's behavior
 kumble par apni niti thopane kaa aarope tha, or khilaadiyon main kam vishwaas tha
 a search for a new coach was also started from then itself
 jab tak team acha pradarshan kar rahi thi, tab tak to sabakuch thik tha
 But questions arise after such performances
 jab puri team fail hui, to ye do khilaadi shaan se khadey the!baad main badhaayaa gaya kaaryalariports kii maane, to kumble chaahate the ki puri team match ke dauraan apni jaan jhonk den, or isi tarah practice bhi kare
 Some players were upset with this attitude, many of the team players wanted to let the team run through the relay
 jisase vivaad gaharaata gaya
 However, amidst all these controversies, Kumble's tenure was extended to the West Indies tour
 pakistan bana championchampions trophy 2017 ke final main pakistan ne bharat ko karaari shikast dekar pehali baar champions trophy ke khitaab par apana kabja kiya he
 With this, India's dream of winning the Champions Trophy for the third time has also been shattered
 viraat kohli kii captaini main isisi kaa toornament khel rahi team india kaa final se pehle tak kaa safar to behad shandaar rahaa, lekin khitaabi mukaable main team bikhar gai
 Team India's defeat against PAK reminded them of the 2003 World Cup final

 jab se ye sho launch hua he tab se sho ke mekars or starcast ise lekar safai hi dete nazar aa rahe hai
 Many TV celebs have also openly criticized the content of the show

 kise pataa he ki ye log koun si jati ke hai? Today, 21 parties, including the Congress, have called a Bharat bandh against the increase in oil prices day by day
 is bich aaj bhi petrol-dijal ke rate main kami nahin ai he, balki daam or bad gaye hai
 Petrol rate has increased by 23 paise while diesel has increased by 22 paise
 in nae daamon ke baad dilli main petrol kii keemat 80 rupee 73 paise prati litre pahunch gai he
 While the price of one liter petrol in Mumbai has reached 88 rupees 12 paise
 vahiin, dijal ke rate main bhi raahat nahin mili he
 Today its price has increased by 22 paise, after which 72 rupees and 83 paise will have to be spent for a liter of diesel in Delhi
 jabaki mumbai kii baat kii jaae to yahaan ek litre dijal kaa rate badhkar 77 rupee 32 paise ho gaya he
 Let me tell you that the Congress has given a call for Bharat Bandh in protest against the rising prices of petrol and diesel
 khabar he ki is baar bharat band kii aguwai upie kii cheirperson sonia gandhi karengi
 The Congress claims that they have the support of 21 parties
 congress kaa kahana he ki band ke dauraan kisi bhi prakaar kii hinsa nahin hogi
 There are 21 parties including SP, BSP, DMK among the parties supporting the bandh
 karnataka sarkaar ne band ke chalate sabhi shikshan sansthaanon main chuttee kaa elaan kar diya he
 There will also be a holiday in government offices
 idhar aam aadmi party ne congress ke is band se kinaaraa kar liya he
 The summer holidays of 2016 are on the verge of ending
 bade hone ke saath-saath hamase sabase pehle chhuttiyon kii suvidha chhin jaati he
 We live somewhere between office to house and house to office
 subah uth kar daftar jane kii taiyaari karnaa or raat ko daftar se waapas aane par nidhaal hokar gir padana
 Life is happening all the time, but it was not always so
 
 
 ek wo bhi daur hua karata tha jab hamen garmi kii chhuttiyon main 'samar task' mila karata tha
 Tasks given in turn by teachers of all different subjects
 bhugol ke teacher dwaara rajya, bharat, asia or duniya ke alag-alag deshon ke nakshe banane ko kaha janaa
 Recalling different forms of verb by Sanskrit verses and English teacher
 maths kaa itnaa task ki bas shamat aa jaati thi
 Science was still the least coming subject, and like Newton, in this world we had come to enmity with children
 rahi-sahi kasarainstin puri kar diya karata
 Since then, the history of akbar-babur's lineage and the objects found in the excavations of harappa-mohenjodaro were the cause of discovery and commendation for anyone, while there is another tedious and boring fact for us to remember our mind Used to go
 in tamaam jhanjhaavaton ke baavjood ham the or hamaara bachapan tha
 Telephones and mobiles were not common in those days
 ham kitabon, nots or inhen samar-winter task kii madad se kisi ke najadik aayaa karte
 Sometimes because of the flowers kept between these copies, sometimes due to the love-hate letters exchanged within them
 tab garmi kii saanjhen bhi lambii or suhaani hua karatin
 In the evening there were games played in the park
 din bharloo bhari dupehrimein khele jane vaale vyapaaree or chess-ludo jaise khelon kii vajah se or din dhalane se pehle tak khele jane vaali cricket se
 We would have completed everything in that period
 khel bhi, mohabbat bhi or apana task bhi
 There was a tendency to do any work
 garmiyaan khatm hote-hote barish aa jaati
 We used to visit our car boat in the rain and sometimes we would take stock of all the village's pools
 skool khulne or doston se milane ke liye roj calendar dekha karte
 Seeing his beloved, he shrugs as if touching a part of the body, the plant of molestations shrinks
 bade or samajhadaar hone ke kram main ham in sahaj-sulabh chizon se apane aap dur hote chale gaye
 We still remember those days

 There, this libaj is seen as the purity of women
 lekin ab saudi princemohammad bin salmaan (saudi Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud) ke ek intervyuu ke baad ye badlaav nazar aa rahaa he
 In fact, in the year 2018, Shahzada Mohammed bin Salman had said in an interview to 'CBS' that the dress code can be relaxed
 unka kahana tha ki yah poshaak islam main anivaary nahin he, lekin iske baad bhi koi aupchaarik niyam nahin banane ke kaaran yah chalan barkaraar he
 Google Doodle: Hans Christian Gram discovers bacteria under microscope, Google makes special doodles, not the first time Saudi Arabian women have raised their voice against the burqa
 isse pehle soshal media par saudi arab kii mahilaon ne is tarah ke pratibandh ke khilaaf abaaya ke bina apni tasviren daali hai
 But this is the first time the case of Saudi Arabian women traveling in public without abaya
 ye tasviren dekh logon kaa alag-alag riection aayaa he, koi inaki suraksha kii dua kar rahaa he to koi inaki himmat ko daat de rahaa he

 This time Bhojpuri sensation Khesari Lal Yadav has come on the show
 jab wo sho main aa rahe the to phens ko lag rahaa tha ki big bos main unka dabadabaa dekhne ko milegaa
 But Khesari's game seems to have faded
 ghar ke sabhi contestant ko bhi lagata he ki unka game down hai
 In the show, Bigg Boss also sentenced him to stay awake overnight
 ab bhojpuri actress or eks contessent sambhaavna seth ne khesari laal yadav ke game par chintaa vyakt kii he
 What Sambhavna thinks about Khesari's game plan Sambhavna said to IWM Buzz - 'I don't think Khesari will be able to stay at home for much longer if he keeps playing like this
 ye hai time he ab khesari ko jaagnaa hoga or game khelnaa hoga
 When he was nominated, he should have strengthened his game from then on so that he would appear in the show
 ummid he ki khesari jald hi bada jump lenge or game khelenge
 Talking about Siddharth Shukla and Shahnaz Gill's bond, Sambhavna said it is interesting for the audience, so it gets maximum attention
 lekin, khesari ghar main aisa nahin kar sakate
 They cannot go down to this level
 unhen upi or bihar main apana kad banaae rakhana he or apni khushhaal shaadishuda jindagi ko bhi santulit karnaa he
 Therefore, it is clear that he would not like to cross any boundary like other contestants
 kyonki yah ghar ke baahar kii sthitiyon ko gadabad kar saktaa he

 This time Rohit Sharma has been included in the Indian Test team for the three-match Test series played against South Africa

 The three-test series against South Africa will be played from October 2
 pehla test vishakhapatnam main khelaa jayega
 In order to achieve success like Virender Sehwag in Test cricket, former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar has advised Rohit Sharma to change his attitude to the longest format of the game
 sunil gavaskar ne kaha, 'safed gend or laal gend kii cricket main kaaphi antar hota he
 The white ball stops swinging in five overs
 laal gend ke chamade main jis tarah ke taanke hote hai aap ise 35 se 40 over ke baad bhi swing karata dekh sakate hai
 Therefore, facing the swing is different and Rohit struggles a little against the incoming ball
 'sunil gavaskar ne kaha, 'yadi rohit sharma kaa shot sellection acha he, to vah test cricket main bhi ran bana paaenge
 Rohit will need to bolster his hopes of succeeding in Test cricket like Sehwag
 jab ham rohit sharma ke bare main baat karte hai, to unke paas virendra sahvaag kii tarah water tite dephence nahin he
 'gavaskar said,' But Rohit Sharma probably has more shots than Sehwag
 sahvaag ne gend ko itani zyada baar on said kii taraf nahin maaraa hoga
 Rohit uses bridge and hook shot very well
 rohit ke paas zyada atekking shot hai
 If Rohit can strengthen his defense against good balls, then he can succeed in Test cricket like Sehwag
 'gavaskar ne kaha, 'rohit agar rabada jaise gendbaaj acchhee tarah saamana karte hai to vah south africa ke khilaaf aane vaali test siries main lambii paariyaan khel sakate hai
 Gavaskar said, "the way Hanuma Vihari has batted in the middle order, it makes it difficult for Rohit Sharma to return to the middle order, so he has a good chance to prove himself in the opening
" 'gavaskar ne kaha, 'ham ek-do test maichon ke baad jaan paaenge
 Visakhapatnam and Pune have good wickets
 agar rohit in pichon par ek acchhee pari khel sakate hai, to vah agle do yaa teen saalon main acchhee shuruyaat kar sakate hai

 com / m110yai7sx In Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh, a minor girl who resisted molestation was shot and killed
 hatyare pichley kai din se ladki ko pareshaan kar rahe the
 a Sitapur police officer told that 15-year-old Jeeranjani (named Kalpinak) and her elder sister work in the home cooking
 rajani somvaar kii der shaam apni badi bahan ke saath ghar laut rahi thi
 On the way, a person named Kuldeep and some of his companions stopped the two sisters
 police ke mutabik aarope he ki kuldeep or uske saathiyon ne donon ladakiyon se chhedchhad kii
 They started mistreating girls
 isi dauraan rajani ne unkavirodhkia
 At which Kuldeep and his associates shot Rajni and fled from the spot
 goli lagate hi rajani jamini par gir padi
 Nearby people ran towards him
 rajani ko police kii madad se aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 Sitapur Superintendent of Police Balendu Bhushan Singh said that the police took action by registering a case against the deceased girl's father Tahrir
 hatyaropee kuldeep or pujari naamak uske saathi ko giraftaar kar liya he
 While the third accused Lokesh is being searched
 bollywood ke superhit dance numbers par najar daalen to zyaadaatar gaanon ko ek hi singer mika singh ne gaaya he
 Micah Singh has sung for every major actor in Bollywood
 is safalataa ke baad bhi mika singh ko apane flop hone kaa dar sataata he
 To overcome this fear, Micah Singh does a strange thing
 iskaa khulaasa pehali baar kapil sharma sho main mika singh ke jigari dost jasbir jassi ne kiya
 Singer Jasbir Jassi said, i have known Micah since childhood
 lekin beete dinon jab main iske ghar gaya to dekha ye ek aadmi ko kabhi phool lagane, kabhi jhaadoo maarane kaa order detaa rahata tha
 i must have thought someone
 phir dekha vahi aadmi mandir main puja kar rahaa he
 i recognized him with his shirt
 phir sochaa mujhe kya hoga koi
 But whenever the man went home, he would see me working first, then worshiping in the temple
 aakhir maine mika se poocha ye kamwala he, pujari he
 He is the one who gives offerings and also works
 is par mika paaji bole- ye meraa driver he
 He did all the work to him because after working, the man used to go to his house and worship in the house
 mika ne dimag lagaaya or use apane mandir main bolaa puja karo
 Not only that, who wants to ask, only ask for me

 Everyone stands there and says, whatever you want, ask for me
 mata ji se kaha, jo tarakkee kerani he, mika kii karo
 This will make us do it
 ye sunakar mika singh ne kaha, haa ye maine kiya he
 Many times these people used to ask for vow inside themselves, then i also said that by speaking in front of me
 jassi ne bataaya, isane sabase bulawaaya ki jo dena he mika ko do, ye hamen de degaa
 Hearing this incident, the audience present on the show could not stop laughing
 khud kapil sharma bhi mika singh ke anokhe kisse sunakar hansate najar aae
 Let me tell you that the host of the show Kapil Sharma pulled the leg of Mica fiercely
 unhone kaha mika paaji 2016 main 4, 2017 main 8 or 2018 main 17 gane gaae hai
 The capacity of your songs is increasing, loan installments are increasing
 kapil kaa ye majaak vaise un par hi palat kar aa gaya
 Micah said jokingly- i sometimes think that i sing so many songs
 har sho par gane ke liye paise milte hai lekin kai aisi shaadiyaan hoti hai jahaan par mujhe free main gaanaa padataa he
 This gesture was towards Kapil Sharma, it did not take any time to understand

 4 similar to Portugal and America in this way
 4 ank rahe, lekin gol antar main pichhadane ke kaaran portugal kaa antim 16 main pahunchane kaa sapana puraa nahin ho paaya

 gyaan ne baayen chor se bahut acha move banaaya or apane daayen paanv se laharaata hua shaat gol ke kareeb pahunchaaya lekin vaaris us par sahi tarah se header nahin laga paye
 Portugal fans finally saw Ronaldo's magical touch in the 80th minute for which he is famous in the world
 jab gend ghana ke gol ke kareeb hawa main tair rahi thi tab jonathan mensah ne header se use bachaane kii koshish kii, lekin ronaldo ko to maano isi pal kaa intjaar tha
 He fired a great shot from his left foot and handed it to the goal

 For five days, the girl's father kept taking her from one ward to another, but no one treated her
 iske baad aspataal main junior doctoron ne bacchee ko kisi senior doctor ke clinics le jane ko kaha
 The doctor said about the operation the next day, lekin vah na oparation ke liye pahunchaa or na hi phone uthaaya
 Meanwhile, the girl died in pain

 The question still remains as to why strict measures are not taken against such careless doctors

 kavi se netaa bane vishwaas se yah puche jane par ki kya vah bijepi main shaamil ho sakate hai, unhone kaha, main aap se baahar aa saktaa hum, lekin bijepi main shaamil nahin hounga
 He criticized the AAP for leaving power in Delhi and said that it should not have happened
 aap netaa ne modi ke kashmir daure ko lekar unki tarif karte hue kaha ki aisa lagata he ki sarkaar kaam kar rahi he
 Vishwas said that despite being an opposing party, there is nothing wrong in praising PM Modi, because if Modi is PM today, even though i have not voted for him, he is also PM for me
 yadi vah acha shashan chalaate hai, main unki tarif karuunga or yadi acha kaam nahin karte he, to unki aalochana bhi karuunga

 ritesh sharma kaa sapana sena main adhikari banakar desh seva karnaa tha
 But luck accepted something else
 college kii padhai ke baad unhone upiessi kii sidies pariksha paas kii
 But, after passing SSB, his dream was not fulfilled due to the knee in medical treatment
 ve depressant main chale gaye
 Despite this, his hobby of playing guitar showed a way in his life
 unhone ek musical group banaaya or parform karne lage
 This is where Ritesh got inspired to do business related to it
 unhone apane doston ke saath milakar musical instruments sailing kaa bijness shuru kiya, jo lagaataar 10 varsh tak chalata rahaa
 With this, he started earning around 48 lakh rupees in a year
 phir ek din unhone salmaan khan starer film ‘kik’ dekhi, bas tabhi se unki soch badal gai
 The desire to do something new was born from here
 samaaj kaa karj utaarne kii chaah jaagi
 After much deliberation, he formed his NGO
 ab ve soshal activist banakar samaaj seva kar rahe hai
 He believes that he has earned the money he needs for his life
 isliye baaki samay desh kii seva or samaaj sudhaar ko dena chaahate hai
 Now they are working to bring awareness to the people by leaving the SUV car and three bikes at home with their earnings
 dedh saal ho gaye, unhone apane musical instrument kii supplai kaa kaam band kar diya he
 Where the perception prevails in the society that funds have to be mobilized for ngos
 jinke videsh main dost yaar hai ve vahaan chande kii vyavastha kar dete hai
 from government to private companies' offices
 aise main ritesh ne in sabhi baton ko nakaarte hue apni or apane saathiyon ke pocket mani se is enjio kaa kharchaa nikaala he
 Ritesh told NDTV, the country is ours, the issues are ours, so we will have to find a solution for this as well
 unhone kaha ki yuvaaon ke paas jate hai or unase samaaj ko behatar banane ke liye sahyog dene kii baat kehete hai
 There are problems at times, but some youngsters are always ready to support
 collejon main yuva apane burgers, cold drinks aadi kaa paisa donnet kar dete hai
 Ritesh says that if there is a pit on the road then why should we complain to the government for this? Why don't we just do that work? is tarah ke vichaaron ke saath ritesh aage bad rahe hai
 The comments ritesh maanate hai ki shahar kii tamaam samasyaon ke hal ke liye ham kab sarkaar kii ore munh kiye rahenge
 Only 4 percent of the country's population is a government service
 sarkaar ke paas main power kii kami he
 So we ask the youth to come forward for this
 ham akasar collejon main jaakar yuvaaon se apane tallent ko samaaj seva main lagane ko kehete hai
 Usually every youth spends 3-4 hours in college and we ask them to give this time to the society
 isse hamen kaaphi badi mainpavar mil jaati he
 It is not that we always ask for donations from people, says Ritesh
 hame yadi shahar kii diwaar ko saaf karnaa he to iske liye ham paint kii dukaan waalon se, company waalon se paint dene ko kehete hai or phir tamaam yuvaaon ke sahare diwaar ko saaf kar shandaar painting bana dete hai
 So instead of dirtying the wall the next time people prefer cleaning
 chaar shaharon main jhuggi jhopadiyon main rahane vaale 42 bacchon ko inaki enjio ne god liya he
 Ritesh and his colleagues have taken up the responsibility of their studies
 ritesh bataate hai ki is samay unki sanstha main 23 active sadsy hai or kareeb 700 walnatirs hai
 How impressed people are with their talk, you can guess from the fact that all this has happened in only six months
 baavjood iske unke jivan main unke guitar bajaane ke shauk ne ek rasta dikhaaya
 He formed a musical group and started performing
 yaheen se ritesh ko isse jude kaarobaar karne kii prerana mili
 He started the business of selling musical instruments with his friends, which ran continuously for 10 years
 isse ve ek saal main kareeb 48 lakh rupee kamaane lag gaye the
 Then one day he saw the Salman Khan starrer film 'kick', just then his thinking changed
 kuch nayaa karne kii chahat yaheen se paidaa hui
 Willingness to pay the debt of the society
 kaaphi soch vichaar karne ke baad unhone apni enjio banaai
 Now they are doing social service by becoming social activists
 unka maananaa he ki unhone apane jivan kii jarurat ke liye laayak dhan kama liya
 Therefore, the rest of the time we want to give service and social improvement to the country
 ab ve apni kamai se kharidi esayuvi car or teen bike ko ghar par chhodkar cycle se logon main jaagrukta laane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 It has been a year and a half, he has stopped supplying his musical instrument
 jahaan samaaj main yah dharna prabal he ki enjio ke liye fund kaa jugad karnaa padataa he
 Those who have friends abroad, they arrange donations there
 sarkaar se lekar nijee companiyon ke daftar main fund ke liye chakkar lagaana padataa he
 In such a situation, Ritesh refuses all these things and has spent the cost of this NGO from his and his colleagues' pocket money
 ritesh ne enditivi se kaha, desh hamaara he, mudde hamaare hai, to iskaa hal bhi hamen hi khojna hoga
 He said that he goes to the youth and asks them to cooperate to improve the society
 kai baar dikkat hoti he lekin kuch yuva hameshaa saath dene ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 In colleges, youth donate their burgers, cold drinks, etc
 ritesh kaa kahana he ki agar sadak par gaddha he to iske liye ham sarkaar se shikaayat kyon karen? kyon na us kaam ko ham hi kar den
 Ritesh is moving forward with such ideas
 tippaniyan Ritesh believes that when we will face the government for solving all the problems of the city
 desh kii aabaadi kaa keval 4 pratishat aadmi sarkari seva he
 The government lacks manpower
 to ham yuvaaon se iske liye aage aane ko kehete hai
 We often go to colleges and ask the youth to apply their talent in social service
 amuman har yuva kalege main 3-4 ghante kharaab kar detaa he or ham unase yah samay samaaj ko dene ko kehete hai
 This gives us a lot of manpower
 ritesh kehete hai, aisa nahin he ki ham hameshaa logon se chande kii maang karte hai
 If we have to clean the city wall, then for this we ask paint shop owners, companies to give paint and then with the help of all the youth, we clean the wall and make a magnificent painting
 aise main agali baar diwaar gandi karne kii bajaay log safai pasand karte hai
 Their ngos have adopted 42 children living in slums in four cities
 inaki padhai kaa jimmaa ritesh evam unke saathiyon ne uthaaya he
 Ritesh says that his organization currently has 23 active members and about 700 volunteers
 log unki baton se kitna prabhavit hai aap is baat kaa andaja is baat se laga sakate hai ki yah sab keval chah maheene main hua he
 Now they are working to bring awareness to the people by leaving the SUV car and three bikes at home with their earnings
 dedh saal ho gaye, unhone apane musical instrument kii supplai kaa kaam band kar diya he
 Where the perception prevails in the society that funds have to be mobilized for ngos
 jinke videsh main dost yaar hai ve vahaan chande kii vyavastha kar dete hai
 Funds have to be circulated from the government to the offices of private companies
 aise main ritesh ne in sabhi baton ko nakaarte hue apni or apane saathiyon ke pocket mani se is enjio kaa kharchaa nikaala he

 Former Army Chief and Union Minister General VK Singh, who was searching for the 39 Indians missing in Iraq, received input about the dunes in the city of Badush, which seemed to have suppressed something here

 It was at this time that IS began to occupy important areas of Iraq and Syria
 tile kii khudaai aise shuru hui jaise ki puratathvik site par kisi pracheen kalakritiyon ko dhundha ja rahaa ho
 General VK Singh told Mail Today, 'when he first started digging, he got a stiff and long hair bunch
 ye is baat kii taakid kar rahaa tha ki ve log punjab ke hamaare apane ho sakate hai
 However, it was not clear how many people could be there
 'jaise-jaise khudaai aage badi, iraqi prashasan ko maanav avshesh milane lage

 In July Mosul was declared independent but the fight was still on and it was not easy to move to central Mosul
 haalanki baad main mosul ke duusare taraf se main irbil or peshmegara tak pahunchaa
 '39 General VK Singh, engaged in fulfilling Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise to find Indians, said that every input the Indian authorities received was about the rogue city, because the last known location of Indians was the rogue city
 haalanki aies ke changul se nikalakar aae messiah ne daawa kiya tha ki agava karne ke baad hi aies ne sabhi bharatiyon ko goliyon se bhun diya tha, lekin vah bachane or bhaagane main safal rahaa
 Although the Government of India did not initially accept the story of Christ
 sarkaar kaa daawa tha ki unhen 39 bharatiyon ke jivit hone kii jaankaree mili he
 Officials traveling with Singh said that many times he had to share a room with the minister and his staff

 com / wpydbdwvv9 — Niyati (@ niyati_45) February 12, 2019 raaj thakare kii raajnneeti ko logon ne nahin kiya sweekarudhav thakare ne pita bal thakare kii viraasat ko badhaayaa ageuddhav ko mila taj, raaj ke khate main ai gumnamiazadee ke mahaj 13 saal baad jab bharat apni nai-nai chunautiyon se jujh rahaa tha thik usee vakt 60 ke dashak main maharashtra kii rajdhani bombai (ab mumbai) main bataur cartoonist ek akhbaar main kaam karne vaala shaks maharashtra kii nai takadir likhane kaa kaam shuru kar chukaa tha jise baad main duniya ne bala sahib thakare ke naam se janaa
 Whatever party may have been in power in Maharashtra, the rule has always been that of Bal Thackeray, without whose permission it was impossible for a government to shake even a leaf
 maharashtra kii raajnneeti main kabhi satta main nahin rahane ke baavjood bhi wo vahaan kii raajnneeti ke sabase prabhaavshaalee or taqatvar shaks bane rahe
 The person who laid the foundation of Shiv Sena 53 years ago, today Uddhav Thackeray, son of the same Bal Thackeray, will take oath as the new Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 jab bal thakare kii umr dhalane lagi to unke raajnneetik viraasat ko aage le jane kii jimmedaari shivasena ke do bade lokapriy chehre raaj thakare or uddhav thakare ke kandhon par ai
 One of them was his son and the other was his nephew
 viraasat kii ladaai raaj thakare ko kahaan tak le gaiaaj uddhav thakare maharashtra kii raajnneeti ke sheersh par pahunch chuke hai or aane vaale 24 ghanton main rajya ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge
 On the other hand, nephew Raj Thackeray, who revolted with uncle Bal Thackeray and formed his new party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, has gone into the background of Maharashtra politics
 uddhav thakare aaj maharashtra kii raajnneeti ke sheersh par pahunch chuke hai or aane vaale 24 ghanton main rajya ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge
 On the other hand, nephew Raj Thackeray, who revolted with uncle Bal Thackeray and formed his new party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, has gone into the background of Maharashtra politics
 uddhav thakare jahaan raajnneetik viraasat ko chhodkar apane photography ke pishan ko follow karne main lage the vahiin duusari taraf shivasena samet maharashtra ke duusare dal bhattije raaj thakare ko bal thakare ke raajnneetik vaaris ke taur par mahasoos karne lage the
 Raj Thackeray's style of speaking and walking resembled that of his uncle Bal Thackeray, so people started seeing him as the heir to Bal Thackeray's legacy
 dilachasp baat yah he ki raaj thakare ko bhi bal thakare kii tarah cartoon banane kaa behad shauk he
 Raj Thackeray, who stood by his shadow in every decision of uncle Bal Thackeray, began to have differences between the two when it was learned that uncle wanted to hand over the party's command and political legacy to his son Uddhav Thackeray
 bal thakare jahaan uddhav ko apni raajnneetik viraasat saunpane ke paksh main the vahiin raaj thakare shivasena party par apana niyantran chaahate the
 The party was formed but did not work, only a few days after Uddhav Thackeray became party chief, Raj Thackeray parted ways with his new party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena in 2006, due to lack of choice in ticket sharing and power struggle
 Formed
 party banane ke do saal baad 2008 main raaj thakare kii party ne marathaon kii raajnneeti or kshetreeyata ko hawa dena shuru kar diya
 They took to the streets demanding the exclusion of North Indians from Maharashtra
 is dauraan mumbai se lekar maharashtra ke zyaadaatar shaharon main uttar bharatiyon ke khilaaf hinsa hui jisamen raaj thakare kii party ke kaaryakartaaon kaa naam saamne aayaa
 Raj Thackeray started a movement against the jobs of North Indians in Maharashtra
 vahiin duusari taraf uddhav thakare ke netritv main shivasena apane pita ke samay se sahyogi rahi party bijepi ke saath dhire-dhire aage badhane lagi or dilli se lekar maharashtra tak main shivasena ne apana vistaar jari rakhaa
 Hated, the North Indians refused to form a new party in 2006, just three years after the 2009 assembly elections in Maharashtra, when Raj Thackeray's party won 13 seats
 thakare kii party ko zyaadaatar waisi siton par jeet mili jahaan marathi votaron kii sankhya zyada thi or wo uttar bharatiyon ko pasand nahin karte the
 This made Raj Thackeray feel that opposing the North Indians and talking about the identity of the Marathas would set him in the politics of Maharashtra
 iske baad wo lagaataar uttar bharatiyon ke khilaaf apmaanajak or bhadakaau baaten karne lage
 His controversial statement about Chhath Puja in 2008 caught a lot of trouble, due to which he also had to face the case
 chhath puja ko lekar die bayaan ke baad uttar bharatiyon main unke khilaaf gussa panpane laga jiskaa sidhaa nuksaan raaj thakare kii party ko sthaneey nikaay chunaav se lekar vidhansabha chunaav tak main hone laga
 After the 2009 assembly elections, Raj Thackeray's bets started to reverse and his hateful politics slowly began to be rejected by the people there
 raaj thakare kaa yaheen se raajnneetik patan shuru ho gaya
 In the 2012 BMC election, where Raj Thackeray's party won 27 seats, in the 2017 election, he won only 1 seat
 thane, kalyaan ullas nagar, pune, nasik, nagpur, maalegaanv, jalgaanv, sangli ke nikaay chunaav main bhi saal 2012 ke mukaable 2017 main raaj thakare kii party ko baari shikast jhelni padi
 His party's account was not even opened in many places
 pehle prashansak phir aalochakasaal 2014 main jab desh main loksabhaa chunaav hone vaale the tab tatkaaleen piem pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kii lahar dekhakar raaj thakare bhi unke samarthan main aa gaye or unhen pradhanmantri banane kii vakaalat karne lage
 Raj Thackeray felt that he could become an alternative to the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra if he moved closer to the BJP, but nothing like this happened
 chunavi saal bitne ke baad jo raaj thakare piem modi ke prashansak hua karte the vahiin unke aalochak ho gaye jo maharashtra main bhi bijepi samarthakon ko nagavar gujri
 In the 2014 assembly elections in Maharashtra, Raj Thackeray's party MNS fielded candidates in 220 out of 288 assembly seats and they had to face defeat
 unki party mahaj ek seat par jeet darj kar pai
 Whereas in the same election Shiv Sena won a stunning 63 seats and became the bjp's ally in Maharashtra's government
 bijepi ke saath baat nahin banati dekh saal 2019 ke maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav se pehle raaj thakare ne anaupchaarik taur par congress se gathbandhan kii koshish shuru kii lekin unki raajnneetik prishthbhumi ko dekhte hue vot bank khisak jane ke dar se congress ne bhi manase se kinaaraa kar liya
 Though Raj Thackeray first announced that he would field his candidates for 100 seats in the state, but later he opted out of the assembly elections like Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi se raar, congress-ensipi se pyaravahin loksabhaa chunaav kii tarah 2019 ke maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main bhi shivasena ne ummid se behatar pradarshan kiya
 While the BJP won 105 seats, the Shiv Sena won 56 seats while remaining in the NDA alliance and then placed a bet on the two-and-a-half-year CM position in front of the BJP in Maharashtra
 jab bijepi ne siem pad ke bantwaare se saaf taur par inkaar kar diya to uddhav thakare ke netritv main shivasena ne congress or ensipi ke saath milakar sarkaar gathan karne or khud kii party kaa siem banane kii raah dhund nikaali
 The Shiv Sena finally succeeded in this after nearly a month of political betting and uproar and now on Thursday Uddhav Thackeray will take oath as the new Chief Minister of Maharashtra, whereas Raj Thackeray has no idea where he is today and what he is doing

 In this proposal of the telecom companies, it has been said that they will charge separately from both the website and the apps that make and use them
 ye charge content, site ke aadhaar par hoga
 But this proposal of companies is being criticized in every part of the country
 is muhim main kai sitare bhi hissaa le rahe hai
 Under this campaign, TRAI has received around 1 lakh mails in which people have requested not to accept the proposal of the telecom companies and to save the internet in the country
 TRAI ne logon se is bare main suzav maanga tha jiske jawaab main TRAI ko ye mail praapt hue hai
 However, TRAI has not yet taken any decision on the issue

 akasar main kahata hum ki hamaari aabaadi ke ek bade hisse kaa anpadh rahanaa ek traasadee he, lekin agar air india ke bare main baat karen to usase bhi badi ek vidambnaa najar aati he ki jo padhe-likhe hai ve bhi saaf najar aa rahi baton ko padhgaye main naakaam rah jate hai
 Hopefully! Government officials and leaders who commanded Air India's fortunes would not have taken the plight of studying the fluctuations seen in the situation during the last few years, it would not have been the plight of this institution set up by JRD Tata
 aaj air india apana vajood kaayam rakhane ke liye sangharsh kar rahi he
 It is not always right to expect financial help from the government to run it
 samay aa chukaa he ki iske astitv kii raksha ke liye kuch kade kadam uthaae jaaen
 If we turn back a few years, we will find that there has never been a shortage of great plans for Air India
 saal dar saal, airline kii kaman sambhaal rahe adhikariyon or hitdharakon ne is rashtriya vimaan seva ko sarvapramukh airline main tabdeel karne kii baat kii he, lekin unki yojanaon ne air india ko oonchaaiyon kii ore le jane kii bajaae or neeche dhakel diya he
 The reason is that not only Ajit Singh, but also his previous ministers like Praful Patel, also understood their religion as making rules
 par un niyamon ke asar par najar rakhane yaa unhen amal main laane main unki dilchaspee nahin rahi
 The merger that Patel designed with an aim to make "government-owned Air India and Indian Airlines jointly capable of facing competition" became an eclipse
 yah ujagar karata he ki kaise vilay kii safalataa ke liye salaahkaaron ke sujhaaye uchit or ahm siforeeshon-equity laana, sthir netritv, karmchaariyon kaa samanvit rup se kaam karnaa or apni kshamtaaon main andhadhundh ijapha kar rahi videshi airlinon par najar rakhana-ko tatkaaleen mantri ne amali jama pehanaane main dhilaai barti yaa nazarandaaj kar diya
 Ajit Singh's own tenure is also reflecting the philosophy of Air India revival or non-existent crisis
 2012 ke april main air india ko sarkaar kii ore se 30,000 karod ru
 a relief package was given which would be over by 2021
 agar yah sahaayta air india ko sitambar, 2012 ke parichaalan sambandhi jaruraton ke maddenjar di gai he to sarkaar ne jahaan pratyaksh videshi nivesh niti kii ghoshnaa ke tahat videshi airlinon ko bharat kii nijee airlinon main 49 fisadi tak ke nivesh hasil karne kii manjuuri di, vahiin yah sandesh bhi de diya ki air india kii shairdharak sarkaar he lihaaja isamen koi or nivesh nahin kar saktaa
 In recent years, Air India has lost many of its assets
 iske upar 46,000 karod ru
 Debt, the burden of increasing losses
 vilay ke baad isamen 35,000 karod ru
 There is a possibility of joining, apart from this the presence of the union is also an important fact
 zyaadaatar karmchaariyon ko abhi tak sthiti kii gambhirtha kaa andaja nahin he
 Who would want to take such an airline? Air India has suffered a lot due to the arbitrariness of the leaders
 unki yojanaon par bharosa karnaa ab mushkil he

 At the same time, another group of students were protesting against the statement made by a teacher on the social media site

 Students protesting against the reduction in the teaching standard say that the demonstration on the social site about the comment is aimed at diverting the attention of the people from the important issue

 But a student present there said that the head of the department shrugged it off saying that he did not have the right to call anyone

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne apana dharna khatm kar diya
 Kejriwal sat with three of his ministers at LG House for the last 9 days
 isse pehle unhone alji house se piem modi ko letters likhaa
 In the letter, he accused PM Modi of stopping many works through LG
 saath hi unhone kaha ki jitani shakti purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko mili thi utani shakti unhen bhi di jaae
 Kejriwal's letter written to PM Modi is amazing
 main or mere mantri raaj nivas main pichley 8 dinon se LG sahib se milane ke liye baithe hai
 And LG Sahib is not ready to meet us
 ye to ek ajooba hi he
 Nobody in the world can believe that they are doing this by themselves
 sabakaa maananaa he ki ye sidhe aapke ishaare par ho rahaa he
 i am a very young man
 meri koi auqaat nahin he
 But here i did not come to meet him in person
 main yahaan par dilli kii janata dwaara chune hue mukhyamantri kii haisiyat se baitha hum
 This is not mine, it is a great insult to the people of Delhi, why are you doing this, i do not know
 kya mukhyamantri se milanaa kisi bhi rajyapal yaa uparajyapal kaa sanvaidhanik daayitv nahin hota? kya mukhyamantri se na milakar wo samvidhan or apane daayitv kaa ulanghan nahin kar rahe?10 dinon main likhe 4 patrapichley 10 dinon main hamane LG sahib ko 4 patr likhe
 He did not answer even one
 unhone mukhyamantri, mantri, saansad, vidhayak- sabase milane se inkaar kar diya
 Two mlas who went to meet them, called the police and pushed them out
 ye sab kya ho rahaa he? ye to bahut galat he
 IAS officers have been on strike for the last four months in Delhi
 dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar kaa IAS afasaron par koi niyantran nahin he
 In Sheila Dixit's time, the Delhi government had complete control over the officers
 shila ji afasaron kaa tabadalaa kar saktin thim, unako suspend kar saktin thim, bhrasht afasar ko jail bhej sakati thim
 Your central government passed the order in May 2015 and snatched all this power from the officers
 aaj main mukhyamantri hokar bhi kisi bhi afasar kaa tabadalaa nahin kar saktaa, galat kaam karne vaale afasar ko suspend nahin kar saktaa yaa kisi bhi bhrasht afasar ko jail nahin bhej saktaa
 Why did you pass such an order? It is obvious that your objective was to cripple the elected government of Delhi
 to aaj dilli main sthiti ye he ki in IAS afasaron se kaam hamen karwaanaa he or in par har tarah kaa niyantran aapkaa he
 how is it possible? If you are from the opposing side, then it is always your endeavor to stop every good work of the elected government of Delhi
 to jaise hi koi IAS afasar acha kaam karne lagata he, aap uskaa yaa to tabadalaa karvaa dete ho yaa phir un par jhuthe muqadame karke unako fansaa dete ho
 Today all the officers of Delhi are very much afraid of you
 aapkaa maqasad ek hi he - kisi bhi tarah dilli sarkaar ke kaam roko
 In the last three years, you tried to stop all the work of the people of Delhi through LG
 aapane rashan kii dorstep delivery rukvaa di, mohalla clinics rukvaa die, nae aspataal banane se rukvaa die, mantriyon ke salaahkaar hatwa die, dilli sarkaar ke sabhi vaqeel hatwa die, kachi coloniyon main vikaas ke saare kaam rukvaa die ityadi ityadi
 It is very wrong to disturb Delhiites and stop their work in this way
 or pradhanmantri khud agar apane hi desh ke vikaas kaaryon ko rokegaa, to desh ke liye is se bada durbhaagya kya ho saktaa he?dilli ke logon ke kaamon ko thap karne ke makaad se hi IAS afasaron kii ye hadtaal aapane karai he
 The strike is being conducted directly from the Prime Minister's Office
 aaj dilli ke IAS afasar apni chuni hui sarkaar ke kilaaf press vaarta kar rahe hai
 Did this happen in India's history till date? never
 dilli main ye pehali baar hua he
 And now it will be in every state in the country where the opposition parties are in government
 paroksh rup se IAS afasaron kaa kahana he ki wo apni suraksha ko lekar chintit hai
 But this is just an excuse
 kal hamaare paryaavaran evam khaadya mantri shri imran ji ne do meeting bulaai

 The Environment Secretary came but the Food Secretary did not
 meri samaj ke baahar he ki paryaavaran sachiv ko jis mantri se suraksha kaa khatara nahin, khaadya ayukta ko usee mantri se suraksha kaa khatara kaise he? khaadya sachiv ne kahalwaya ki wo nahin aaenge, wo apane special sachiv ko bhej rahe hai
 So how is it that the Special Secretary is not threatened by the Minister with whom the Food Secretary is at risk? afasaron kaa is tarah se durupyog thik nahin he
 This can have very serious and far-reaching consequences for the country
 aapane pichley chaar maheenon se dilli ke IAS afasaron se hadtaal karvaa rakhi he
 You have stopped the entire Delhi government
 ye baat kisi ke liye sochni bhi mushkil he ki kisi desh kaa pradhanmantri raajnneetik dwesh ke chalate apane hi desh kii rajdhani ke IAS afasaron kii hadtaal karvaa de? apane hi desh ke logon ko musiibat main daal de?ias adhikariyon kii hadtaal band karavaaenap jo kar rahe hai, ye behad khataranaak he
 i request you to stop this strike immediately
 or IAS adhikariyon ko aadesh den ki wo turant kaam par lauten
 Your LG Sahib tells us that you people should meet the officers and end the strike
 ham to in IAS adhikariyon se kai baar mil chuke
 Whenever we met the officials, they said that they have no demand, they want to work, just once LG Sahib gestures
 chunki in adhikariyon ko transafar or suspend karne kii power aapke or LG sahib ke paas he, isliye wo log hadtaal khatm karne se darate hai
 As per the order of May 2015, you have taken away all the power from us, that is why we are not able to end their strike
 jo shaktiyaan shila ji ke samay unki sarkaar ke paas thim, aaj hamaari sarkaar ke paas uski 10% power bhi nahin he
 In the last three years, you passed one order after another and took away all the power of the elected government of Delhi
 jab aap loksabhaa or vidhaan sabha chunaavon ke pehle dilli ke logon se vot maangane aae the, aap ne to dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 The people of Delhi have faithfully voted for you and won all the seven seats
 lekin aapane to vaadakhilaafi kii
 Instead of giving full state rights to the people of Delhi, you snatched away half the state's rights
 aapke pradhanmantri banane ke pehle dilli aadha rajya tha, aapane to dilli ko 10% rajya bhi nahin choda
 Give back as much power as Sheel Dixit had with the government of Power Sheila, you give all those powers back to our government, we will end this strike on our own, then you will not come
 aaj sari power aapke paas he or sari zimmedaariyaan hamaari - ye kaise chal saktaa he?azaadi kii ladaai ke baad hamane desh main bahut soch samaj kar loktantric vyavastha ko apanaaya jisamen janata apni sarkaar chunati he, wo sarkaar janata ke man mutabiq kaam karti he or sidhe janata ko javabdeh hoti he
 This system of democracy will collapse if the central government does not allow the state governments of elected opposition parties to work with some excuse
 hamaari aapse punah vinati he ki dilli ke logon ke liye hamen kaam karne den or LG sahib ko kahen ki is samasya kaa turant samaadhaan nikaalen
 The people of Delhi will be grateful to you
 haalanki ji-factor kii kaaphi aalochana kii gai he, kyonki yah spasht nahin he ki vibhinn sangyanatmak kshamtaaon ke bich sambandh sahi myne main bhinn mastishk circuits ke bich sambandh paraspar sambandhon ko darshata he yaa nahin
 New results may reveal whether this is true or not
 shodhpatr ke mukhya lekhak stephen smith mutabik, 'hamen ummid he ki mastishk chhavi ke aankadon ko dekhakar ham mastishk sanyojanon kaa vishisht tareekon se sambandh jaan paaenge or jaan paaenge ki is prakaar ke pareekshanon main mastishk ko kya kaary karnaa padataa he
 ' husn ko dekhakar ishk ke hosh akasar ud jate hai, lekin chikani chameli ko dekhakar jo haal salmaan khan kaa hua he wo isse pehle kabhi nahin hua
 Salman felt the shock of Katrina that after that he smelled jasmine everywhere
 salmaan chikani chameli par phisal gaye hai
 Salman Khan is surprised to see this Marathi shock of Katrina
 mumbai main ravivaar kii raat hue ek aword samaaroh main pahunche salmaan chikani chameli kii tarifon kii jhadi laga di
 Nowadays it seems Salman needs an excuse to praise Katrina
 wo kya he ki pichley dinon dublin main katrina salmaan ke saath ek tha tiger kii shooting kar chuki hai
 In such a situation, Salman and Katrina's friendship has started in a new way
 brallep ho chukaa he lekin dosti jari he
 Praise remembered that Salman used to draw loopholes in every act of Katrina earlier
 wo bhi din the jab salmaan katrina kii filmein to kya promo bhi nahi dekhte the
 It seems that Salman got a glimpse of both Helen and Madhuri together in this Marathi avatar of Katrina
 lagata he agnipath ke is item ke zarie katrina salmaan kii agnipariksha main paas ho gayi
 We have a status of Aziz sitamagar ko ham ajeez
 No is not kind gar wo meharbaan nahin he
 After Salman's kindness, we talk about Ranbir's kindness
 ranbir kah rahe hai ki wo itane biji hai ki abhi tak katrina kaa ye superhit jhatka nahin dekh paye hai
 Even though Ranbir may not have seen smooth smooth jasmine jitters all over the place these days, but let us tell you that the beauty of this beautiful house at Kanchachina's base is full and compliments Katrina's desi style
 aakhir katrina ne puure 10 dinon tak is ek gane par mehnat kii tab kahin jaakar wo shoot ke liye raji huin
 Who can see this whistle dance of Katrina saying that they did not even know the meaning of Paua
 khayr agnipath jaise hivoltage drama main katrina kii balkhaati qamar ne wo karant diya he ki ab vijay deenanath chouhan or kaanchachatina kii baat baad main hogi or chikani chameli kaa zikr pehle

 The era is gone when two actresses working in a film feel uncomfortable with each other

 The direction of Katrina in the film is smaller than the direction
 is par disha ne kaha ki ve niswaarth rup se apane role kaa chayan karti hai
 During the interview with Pinkvilla, when Disha was asked, did you make your role feel small due to Katrina being in the film? To this, Disha said, "india is a completely different story
 film main meraa role kitna chota, isse mujhe kuch bhi fark nahin padataa he
 i just believe in doing something that leaves a mark on the pages of time
