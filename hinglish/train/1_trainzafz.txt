 What the Islamic State wants: ISIS has declared its head as the Khalifa of all the Muslims of the world
 ye aatanki sanghathan ek aisi jagah bananaa chahta he jahaan unke anusaar islam ke sharia kanoon lagu hon
 Its goal is to capture Muslim populated areas of the world
 ISIS kii pahachalmerica ne country report on terarysm for 2014 main khulaasa kiya he ki al kaayda ko peeche chhod kar islamic state duniya kaa sabase khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan banataa ja rahaa he

 We have started seeing communal violence in a fixed frame
 nateeja yah hota he ki ham nai ghatana ko bhi pehle ho chuki ghatana samajhakar andekha kar dete hai, kyonki aisi har ghatana main bahes ke jitne bhi pahalu hai, wo lagbhag fiks ho chuke hai
 Which question will be there, which will be the answer, which side will be there, so either you or we are beginning to be normal about the news of communal violence
 hamen pataa bhi nahin chalata he ki dhire-dhire in saamaanya sampradayik hinsa kii ghatnaon kii sankhya saikadon se ab hazaron main hone lagi he
 Surely big incidents like riots are not happening
 haalanki kai jagahon par badi sankhya main dukaane jali hai, log ghayal hue hai
 
 magar hazaron kii sankhya main hone vaali sampradayik ghatnaon kii prakruti maamuli jhagade kii hoti he, jinase bavaal hota he
 Then there is a lot of debate in the local area
 hindu aise hote hai, musalmaan aise hote hai ki baaten chalane lagati hai
 We should really worry about how long we will continue to weaken our social fabric in this way
 is raajnneeti se satta mil sakati he, lekin yah bhi to puuchhiye ki us satta se aapako kya mil rahaa he? kya aapako pados main jhagada chahie? The English newspaper Hindustan Times has studied the police records of the communal incidents taking place in Uttar Pradesh
 ek maheenaa lagaakar appu esthos suresh ne tamaam record kii chaanbin kii he or ise 17 or 18 aktubar ke din ek lambii rapat prakashit kii he
 The third part will also be published on 19 October
 appu ne bataaya he ki 31 july 2014 ke aasapaas uttar pradesh ke ek nahin balki nau zilon main ek saath sampradayik hinsa kii ghatana darj kii gai he
 Two years before today
 tippaniyan Today we will talk to Appu only, but i want to put the special things of his report in front of you
 75 zilon kaa record dekhakar main bhi chaunk gaya
 Have we become so helpless that in such a way thousands of communal incidents will happen and everything will be left to the political parties, who are more interested in taking advantage of it
 samaaj ke bheetar se kab awaz uthegi
 Appu's research, however, states that
 
 
 upi main janvari 2010 se 2016 ke bich sampradayik hinsa kii 12,000 ghatnaayen hui hai
 2,000 communal incidents every year by year
 din ke hisaab se har din paanch se adhik sampradayik ghatnaayen
 There is no communal violence recorded on just one day and that is 25 December 2014
 saal 2016 main janvari se april ke bich 1,262 sampradayik ghatnaayen darj hui hai
 3,708 cases have been reported in 2015 and 2,884 in 2014
 sampradayik hinsa kii in chhitput ghatnaon main lagaataar vruddhi kyon ho rahi he
 Even after hearing the number of 12,000, should we call these incidents sporadic
 appu ne in ghatnaon ke liye lo intencity communal shabd istemaal kiye hai
 These stresses occur locally
 dangon main badalane se pehle police kaabo paa leti he
 These figures show that the number of communal incidents is increasing
 
 But perhaps they are also telling that the police is also able to control it
 varna inamen se kisi ke bhi bade jhagade main badalane kii sambhaavna se aap inkaar nahin kar sakate
 But will the police have enough control? in maamalon main jaanch or mukademon ke anjaam kii kahani bhi police kii mustaidi ko sawaalon ke ghere main laa sakati he
 It also means that political agencies are executing these incidents of communal tension as a strategy
 log jab jaanate hai to log bant kyon rahe hai
 Appu has stated in his report through graphics
 
 
 bif yaa gohatya ko lekar hone vaali sampradayik ghatnaon kii sankhya kaise bad rahi he
 
 2010 main in kaarnon se sirf 130 maamle darj hote hai, jo 2014 main 458 ho jate hai
 Out of 3,708 incidents recorded in 2015, 696 incidents related to beef or cow slaughter
 usee tarah se qabristaan ko lekar jhagada, mandir-masjid or dharmik aayojanon kii bhi bhoomika rahi he
 Appu has added all this to the item of religious intolerance
 2010 main dharmik ashishnutaa ke kaaran 592 sampradayik hinsa kii ghatnaon main se 98 ghatnaayen hoti hai
 In 2014, 715 out of 2,884 incidents are due to religious intolerance
 2015 main 3,708 ghatnaon main se 905 ghatnaayen dharmik ashishnutaa ke kaaran hoti hai
 We have just reported that in 2015, there were 3,708 incidents of communal violence in UP
 inamen se 1,600 ghatnaayen bif yaa dharmik ashishnutaa ko lekar hui hai
 Their motive is clear that there is tension but do not provoke riots on a large scale
 tanaav se hota yah he ki sthaneey ilaake main garmagarm bahes hone lagati he ki wo aise hai
 
 ye aise hai
 While arguing, the communal camp of you people starts
 roti-kapadaa or naukari ke sawaal ko chhod aap in sawaalon ke aadhaar par raajnneetik pasand banane lagate hai
 While seeing the cause of these incidents, it should be expected from the general public that they laughed and said that it is known that this happens, but we will not quarrel
 appu kii tarah ek or patrkaar hai nasiruddin haidar khan
 He www

 has written an article on com
 angrezi or hindi ke 13 samachar patron or website par chhapi sampradayik hinsa kii khabaron kaa sankalan kiya he, jinhen ham chhitput hinsa kehete hai
 During the procession of Durga idol immersion and refreshment in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar between October 11 and 15, there have been so many incidents of conflict that you may not even be shocked because we and you have become normal
 nasiruddin ne likhaa he ki
 
 
 During the immersion of the Durga statue in Gonda, there was a charge of stone pelting
 tanaav badha to tazia cameti ne tazia nahin nikaala
 In Mau too, there was tension over the immersion of the statue and the breaking of the taziya
 aligarh main kabristaan kii zamin par ravan jalaane ko lekar tanaav failaa
 During the Muharram in Bilari area in Moradabad, there was tension over a procession
 13, 14 or 15 aktubar ko gonda ke motiganj, baharich ke fairpur main tanaav hua
 Such incidents have happened in many places in Bahraich
 nasir ne likhaa he ki maharajaganj, kushinagar, baliya, balrampur, bareli, sitapur or raibareli main bhi juluus ke raste ko lekar tanaav hua he
 Elections are not going to be held in Bihar either, but why are these tensions happening there
 bihar ke purvi champaran ke turakuliya main bhi sampradayik tanaav bad gaya
 a similar case occurred in Sugauli here
 pashchim champaran ke betia ke ek mohalle main bhi tanaav ho gaya
 Gaya, Madhepura, Bhojpur, Piro, Gopalganj, Sitamarhi have also been reported
 saal or jagah badal jane ke baad bhi tanaav ke kaarnon main gazab kii samanta he
 Do we really not understand these reasons or people who carry out these matters from both sides in an organized manner, they have full faith in the people that people will flare up
 inhen kaarnon se log 1940 main bhi bhadke the, 1960 main bhi bhadke or 2016 main bhi bhadakenge
 Can everything be so fixed? hamaare aaj ke mehmaan patrkaar saathi ne pichley saal bihar se ek aisi hi report prakashit kii thi
 Appu took two months to see the police records of 38 districts
 tab ve indian express main the or ab hindustan times main hai
 Appu had told that
 
 
 june 2013 ke chunaav se pehle ke maheenon tak bihar main sampradayik hinsa kii ghatnaon kii sankhya badhkar 667 ho gai he
 Between June 2013 and 2010, there were only 226 such incidents
 in ghatnaon main ek pattern yah bhi dikh rahaa he ki kai jagahon par sthaneey media inhen kawarej nahin detaa
 The national media also ignores
 jaisaa ki bengal main ise lekar bahes ho rahi he ki iskaa laabh uthaakar sampradayik giroh afvaah failaane lagate hai ki media kisi ek samudaay kaa paksh le rahaa he
 It remains to be seen whether this decision of the media is on the basis of discretion, or the decision not to do coverage matches the communal strategy to take advantage of it and spread the rumor
 kai jagahon par afvaah failaane main media kii sidhi bhoomika saamne ai he
 You will find many research articles related to this on the Internet
 angrezi akhbaar hindustan times ne uttar pradesh main ho rahi sampradayik ghatnaon ke police record kaa adhyayan kiya he
 Appu Esthos Suresh, after spending a month, scrutinized all the records and published a long report on October 17 and 18
 teesraa hissaa 19 aktubar ko bhi prakashit hoga
 Appu has stated that around 31 July 2014, not one but nine districts of Uttar Pradesh have recorded an incident of communal violence simultaneously
 aaj se do saal pehle
 The comments aaj ham appu se hi baat karenge, lekin unki report kii khaas baton ko aapke saamne rakhana chahta hum
 i was also shocked to see a record of 75 districts
 kya ham itane laachaar ho gaye hai ki is tarah hazaron kii sankhya main sampradayik ghatnaayen hoti rahengi or sab kuch raajnneetik dalon par chhod diya jayega, jinaki dilchaspee iskaa phayda uthaane main hi adhik hoti he
 When will there be a voice from within the society
 baharhaal appu kii research bataati he ki
 
 
 There have been 12,000 incidents of communal violence in UP between January 2010 and 2016
 saal ke hisaab se har saal 2,000 sampradayik ghatnaayen
 More than five communal incidents every day by day
 sirf ek din koi sampradayik hinsa darj nahin hui he or wo he 25 disambar 2014
 Between January and April, there were 1,262 communal incidents in 2016
 2015 main 3,708 maamle darj hue hai or 2014 main 2,884
 Why are these sporadic incidents of communal violence continuously increasing
 12,000 kii sankhya sunne ke baad bhi kya hamen in ghatnaon ko chhitput kahana chahie
 Appu has used the terms low intensity community for these events
 sthaneey str par ye tanaav hote hai
 Police overcomes before turning into riots
 ye aankade bataa rahe hai ki sampradayik ghatnaon kii sankhya badhati hi ja rahi he
 
 magar shaayad ye bhi bataa rahe hai ki police kaabo bhi kar paa rahi he
 Otherwise, you cannot rule out the possibility of any of them turning into big fights
 par kya police kaa kaabo paanaa hi kaaphi hoga
 In these cases, the story of the investigation and the outcome of the cases can also bring the promptness of the police in question
 iskaa ye bhi matlab he ki raajnneetik agenciyaan sampradayik tanaav kii in ghatnaon ko ek ranneeti ke tahat anjaam de rahi hai
 When people know why people are dividing
 appu ne graphics ke zariye apni report main bataaya he ki
 
 
 How is the number of communal incidents related to beef or cow slaughter increasing
 
 In 2010, only 130 cases are reported for these reasons, which goes up to 458 in 2014
 2015 main darj 3,708 ghatnaon main se 696 ghatnaayen bif yaa gohatya ko lekar hoti hai
 In the same way, quarrel over the graveyard, temple-mosque and religious events also played a role
 appu ne is sabko dharmik ashishnutaa ke mad main jod diya he
 In 2010, out of 592 communal violence incidents due to religious intolerance, 98 occur
 2014 main 2,884 main se 715 ghatnaayen dharmik ashishnutaa ke kaaran hoti hai
 Out of 3,708 incidents in 2015, 905 incidents are due to religious intolerance
 abhi hamane bataaya ki 2015 main upi main sampradayik hinsa kii 3,708 ghatnaayen darj huin
 Of these, 1,600 incidents have occurred over beef or religious intolerance
 inkaa makasad saaf he ki tanaav ho magar bade str par danga na bhadke
 The tension is that there is a heated debate in the local area that they are like this
 
 They are like this
 bahes karte-karte aap logon kii sampradayik khmebandi hone lagati he
 Except for the question of bread and cloth and job, you start making political choices based on these questions
 jabaki in ghatnaon kaa kaaran dekhen to saamaanya janata se ummid kii jaani chahie ki wo koob hanse or kahe ki pataa he ki aisa hi hota he, magar ham jhagada nahin karenge
 Nasiruddin Haider Khan is another journalist like Appu
 inhone www
 youthkiawaaz
 com par ek lekh likhaa he
 We have compiled news reports of communal violence on 13 newspapers and websites in English and Hindi, which we call sporadic violence
 isi 11 se 15 aktubar ke bich uttar pradesh or bihar main durga murti visarjan or taziye ke juluus ke dauraan takaraav kii itani ghatnaayen hui hai ki aap shaayad chaunke bhi na, kyonki ham or aap saamaanya ho chuke hai
 Nasiruddin wrote that
 
 
 gonda main durga pratimaa ke visarjan ke dauraan patharav kaa aarope laga
 If the tension increased, the Tazia Committee did not remove Tazia
 mau main bhi pratimaa visarjan or tazia tode jane ko lekar tanaav hua
 Tension prevailed over the burning of Ravana on the cemetery land in Aligarh
 muradabad main bilari ilaake main muharram ke dauraan ek juluus nikaalane ko lekar tanaav ho gaya
 On 13, 14 and 15 October, there was tension in Moti Ganj, Gonda, Fakharpur of Bahraich
 baharich main kai jagahon par aisi ghatnaayen hui hai
 Nasir has written that there has been tension over the procession route in Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Ballia, Balrampur, Bareilly, Sitapur and Rae Bareli
 bihar main to chunaav bhi nahin hone vaale hai, lekin vahaan ye tanaav kyon ho rahe hai
 Communal tension also increased in Turkoulia of East Champaran in Bihar
 yaheen ke sugauli main bhi isi tarah kaa maamla hua
 There was also tension in a locality in Bettiah, West Champaran
 gaya, madhepura, bhojpur, pero, gopalganj, sitamarhi se bhi aisi khabaren ain hai
 Even after the year and the place has changed, there is a similarity in the causes of stress
 kya vaaki ham in kaarnon ko nahin samajhate hai yaa jo log sangathit tareeke se donon taraf se in maamalon ko anjaam dete hai, unhen logon par puraa bharosa he ki log bhadakenge hi
 For the same reasons, people raged in 1940, raged in 1960 and in 2016
 kya sabakuch itnaa fiks ho saktaa he
 Our today's guest journalist fellow published a similar report from Bihar last year
 do maheene lagaakar appu ne 38 zilon kaa police record dekha tha
 He was then in the Indian Express and now in the Hindustan Times
 appu ne bataaya tha ki
 
 
 The number of incidents of communal violence in Bihar has increased to 667 in the months preceding the June 2013 elections
 june 2013 se 2010 ke bich aisi ghatnaon kii sankhya 226 hi thi
 There is also a pattern in these incidents that in many places the local media does not give them coverage
 rashtriya media bhi andekha karata he
 As it is being debated in Bengal that by taking advantage of this, communal gangs start spreading rumors that the media is favoring any one community
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki media kaa yah faisla swavivek ke aadhaar par he yaa kawarej na karne kaa faisla sampradayik ranneeti se mail khaataa he taaki iskaa laabh uthaakar afvaah failaane kaa mauka mili
 In many places, the media's direct role in spreading the rumor has emerged
 aapako internet par isse sambandhit kai shodhaparak lekh milenge
 Today we will talk to Appu only, but i want to put the special things of his report in front of you
 75 zilon kaa record dekhakar main bhi chaunk gaya

 kiran chopra (58 varsh) emdi, chopra ritek rabar products limitedeston martin van-77 ko pahachaanate hai? vahi james bond vaali car
 But do you know that two and a half crores of rupees
 kii laagat vaali yah anokhi 77 kaaren tabhi sadak par chal pain jab iske silencer main lakhanu ke bane rabar patrs lagaae gaye
 These cars were ready in early 2010 but could not hit the road due to malfunction in the rubber parts of the silencer
 britain sthit eston martin ke mukhyalay ne videsh main maujuud sabhi badi automobile companiyon se sampark saadhaa lekin unke upkaran james bond kii is car ko dauda na sake
 In September 2010, Aston Martin Company, engaged in the research of silencer rubber parts manufacturers, approached Kiran Chopra, MD, Chopra Retech Rubber Products Ltd, Lucknow
 kuch maheenon ke prayaas ke baad kiran kii company kaa banaaya rabar upkaran eston martin ke model van-77 main feet baith gaya or ye mahangi lagjri 77 kaaren sadakon par daudaahe lageen
 Kiran Chopra, a resident of Gokhale Marg, Lucknow, belongs to a family that pioneered the automobile trade in Peshawar, Pakistan before independence
 rolls royas se lekar ambesder jaisi gadipoon kii agency inke paas thi
 After the partition of the country, his family moved to India
 yahaan bhi ve gadipoon ko bechney kaa vyavsaay hi karne lage
 Although Kiran's father J
 si
 Something else was going on in Chopra's mind
 ve gadipoon ke bijness se hatakar nirmaan ke kshetra main haath aajmaana chaahate the
 For this, he bought a small rubber factory at Talkatora in Aishbagh in Lucknow and started making rubber parts for vehicles
 us vakt lakhanu ke saint francis college main pard rahe kiran kii rabar technology main khaas dilchaspee thi
 After graduating in 1973, he enrolled in the world-renowned London College of Rubber Technology
 do saal kii padhai ke dauraan kiran ne college main top kiya
 The advantage of this was that he got the opportunity to get training in rubber technology in leading companies of the world
 isse unka aatmavishvaas badha or jab padhai puri kar kiran lakhanu waapas aae to unhone apane pita ko is baat ke liye raji kiya ki agar bijness ko aage badhanaa he to ise videshon tak pahunchaana padegaa
 This is where a new beginning took place
 kiran bataate hai, “maine sochaa ki jo sabase kathin bazaar he agar vahaan hamane kamyaabi hasil kar lee to duniya main ham chaa jaaenge
 "since Germany was the leader in automobiles even in those days, Kiran focused on German engineering
 germany main har saal sitambar main duniya kaa sabase bada automobile mela lagata tha
 In 1977 Kiran went there, saw vehicles but was in a dilemma
 ve bataate hai, “maine sochaa ki hamaari company kaa bijness tabhi badhegaa jab ham ve parts banaaen jo baar-baar kharaab hote hon
 These will be the parts that are mounted under the car
 ” kiran ne ek car ke nichle hisse kaa muyna kiya to paaya ki dhuaan chhodie vaale silencer ke saath kai saare rabar ke parts lage hote hai jo uske kampan ko gaadi main failane se rokte hai
 At the time, three vehicles in the international market were mercedes-benz, Volkswagen and General Motors, which sold more Opel
 kiran in gadipoon ke silencer ke rabar parts ke namoonay lekar lakhanu aae or ek varsh kii kadi mehnat ke baad hu-ba-hu vaise hi rabar parts taiyaar kar liye
 This time, these parts of Lucknow were displayed by putting a stall in Germany's automobile fair
 inhone car nirmaataa companiyon kaa dhyaan to batora lekin ye bharat main bhi ban sakate hai, ise lekar andeshaa tha
 Kiran explains, “we did not focus on making rubber parts for new cars because the demand of these big companies could not be met by sitting in Lucknow
 hamane parts ke riplacement kaa bazaar pakadaa
 Which means that when new vehicles are replaced, they become ours when they are replaced
 ” germany ke automobile meley main “ritek company” ke maalik ritek ko kiran ke upkaran behad pasand aae
 a few days later he also came to Lucknow to see Kiran's factory and, having confidence, ordered two lakh rubber parts of the silencer
 pehali baar lakhanu hi nahin desh main kisi bhi nirmaan company ko videshi company se itnaa bada order mila tha
 Kiran fulfilled her order by borrowing from the bank
 chunki ye parts vishwastareey gunvattta vaale the, isliye vishwa kii sabase mashhoor gadipoon main silencer ke riplacement rabar parts ke bazaar main lakhanu chaane laga
 Apart from Germany, demand for these devices also increased in the US market
 dekhte hi dekhte kiran kii company riplacement bazaar kii agua ban gai lekin yah sthiti zyada dinon nahin tik saki
 The rupee was strengthening in the eighties and now foreign companies started to trade with India and felt a loss deal
 halaat ye ho gaye ki 1985 aate-aate kiran ko rabar ke parts banane kaa kaarkaana band karnaa padaa
 a few days later, Kiran started selling it to other businesses
 “bits” ke naam se lakhanu main ek computer ajukeshan centre kholaa, jisane chaatro ke bich kaaphi khyaati batori
 Seven years later in 1992, when the rupee weakened considerably against the dollar, the situation changed again
 videshi companiyon ke liye bharat se vyapaar karnaa phydemand ho gaya tha
 Once again the owner of the retake company contacted Kiran
 ab ek nai company chopra ritek rabar products limited kii neenv padi
 a factory on Deva Road, Chinhat in Lucknow was closed
 nai mashine kharidi gayi or dedh saal ke bheetar inamen kaam shuru ho gaya
 Within three to four years, chopra-ritek's jugalbandi captured the silencer rubber parts market in Europe
 saat varsh baad kiran ne lakhanu main hi videshi kaaron ke suspension main lagane vaale rabar ke bush banane shuru kiye jo bazaar main chaa gaye
 Today the situation is that Chopra Retech Rubber Products Ltd
 of Lucknow is the biggest and preferred supplier of "TENECO", the largest company selling rubber parts of silencer of foreign cars and "federalmogel", the largest company supplying suspension rubber parts
 kiran chopra fakhr ke saath kehete hai, “hamaari company kaa aayaat shunya or niryaat sau fisadi he
 "not only this, the rubber parts of silencers of all cars made in the world since 1960 are with this company of Lucknow which are not available anywhere else

 punjab main lungar or prasad ke jiesti ke daayre main aane par ab raajnneeti bhi shuru ho gai he
 Actually till now there was no VAT or other tax of any kind on raw material purchased for anchors and offerings, but after GST came into force from July 1, now ration and other items purchased for making anchors and offerings But GST has come into force
 isi vajah se amritsar ke swarna mandir or sikhon ke gurudwaron kaa sanchaalan karne vaali sanstha shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti ke andar aane vaale tamaam gurudwaron main lungar or prasad bananaa mahangaa ho gaya he
 The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee has requested the Punjab and Central Government to give exemption from GST to the goods to be purchased for making langar and prasadam
 lekin ab tak sarkaar kii taraf se is chhot ko lekar kuch bhi saaf nahin kaha gaya he
 For this reason, SGPC head Kripal Singh Badungar said that the Golden Temple and other gurdwaras have 24-hour langar facilities and that there is no langar and prasad given to every visitor without taking any money there without any discrimination of religion and caste
 is
 aise main jiesti lagane se gurudwaron ke liye lungar chalaanaa behad mushkil ho gaya he or gurudware daan se mili rakam se hi ye lungar chalaate hai naa ki kisi laabh yaa phaayde ke liye langaron ko chalaaya jaataa he
 In such a situation, the goods purchased for langars should be given relief in GST
 prasad or lungar ko GST se baahar karne kii maangapunjab ke mukhyamantri amarinder singh ne bhi vibhinn dharmik sansthaanon main die jane vaale prasad or lungar jaise saamudayik bhojanalay ko jiesti se baahar karne kii maang kii he
 The Chief Minister has written a letter to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on the appeal of Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee and other people and institutions, demanding the exclusion of these goods from the Goods and Services Tax
 siem amarinder kaa jetali ko patsemarinder ne apane patr main jetali ko yaad dilaayaahai ki gurudwara ko lungar main bhojan dene ke liye waite ke bhugtan se chhot di gai thi
 But under the new GST system, tax has to be paid on it as well as tax on Prasad sales
 is vajah se sabhi dharmik sansthaanon mandir, gurudwara, masjid or girjagharon par asar pad rahaa he
 GST taxation on goods purchased by religious institutions is not correct as these centers have no source of income and are run with donated funds
 unhone jetali se maamle par punarvichaar karne kaa anurodh kiya or sabhi dharmik sansthaanon ko jisti se mukt karne kii maang kii
 It calls for gst-free goods not only for the purchase and sale of offerings, but also at the langar
 pehle khud raahat de rajya sarkaaravahin is mudde par akali dal ne punjab sarkaar ko yaad dilaayaa ki jis jiesti council ne lungar or prasad ke liye kharide jane vaale saamaan ko jiesti ke daayre main rakhaa he, us jiesti council ke member punjab ke vitt mantri manpreet badal bhi hai to kyon nahin unhone usee vakt lungar or prasad ke liye kharidi jane vaali tamaam saamagree ko jiesti ke daayre se baahar rakhwane kii koshish nahin kii
 Also, the State Governments have the authority to give exemption of 66% GST to the institutions, why not the Punjab Government itself take the initiative and give SGPC relief of 66% GST for the goods purchased for the anchor
 iske baad centre sarkaar se bhi jiesti hatwane kii koshish kii jaani chahie
 Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Badal said that he would meet Finance Minister Arun Jaitley regarding the delegation of the Akali Dal on this issue and would demand relief from GST for running langars and offerings to other religious institutions like SGPC
 AAP ne bhi kii jiesti se raahat kii batam aadmi party bhi gurudwaron ke lungar ke liye kharide jane vaali vastuon or saamagree ko jiesti ke daayre se baahar rakhane kii maang kii he
 Senior leader of Punjab, Aam Aadmi Party, Sukhpal Khaira said that the anchor of religious institutions and especially inside the Golden Temple and other gurdwaras is served to the person of every religion without any discrimination and this anchor is not a means of earning
 Rather it is a symbol of religious reverence and harmony
 aise main in langaron ko jiesti se raahat har haal main milani chahie or punjab sarkaar pehle apane level par hi jiesti se raahat dene kii koshish kare or uske baad centre sarkaar se bhi raahat dilwane kii koshish kare
 There is no response from the Central Government, since the GST has been implemented, the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee has been continuously demanding that GST should not be applied to all the materials and items purchased for the langar in the gurdwara, but so far from the Central Government There is no talk of giving exemption, and this is why this issue is now turning into a big political issue
 bharatiyon ke fasebuk data tak pahunch banaakar desh main chunaavon par asar daalane ke aaropon se ghiri videshi company cambridge analitica ne kya pichley saal modi sarkaar se jhooth bolaa tha? yah sawaal buudhvaar ko tab uth khadaa hua jab sarkaar ne bataaya ki cambridge analitica ne kisi bhartiya kaa apane paas data na hone kii baat kahi thi, jabaki fasebuk ne sarkaar ko bataaya tha ki analitica ke paas paanch lakh se adhik bharatiyon kaa data he
 In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, the government has informed the contradictory claims of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica
 koun sach bol rahaa koun jhooth, is daawey kii padtaal ke liye sarkaar dobaaraa donon companiyon ko notice jari kar chuki he
 In fact, Karnataka BJP MP Anant Hegde had on Wednesday asked the government several questions about data theft from social media platforms, what steps are being taken to stop it
 is sawaal ke likhit jawaab main soochna evam praudyogiki mantri sanjay dhotre ne bataaya ki bhartiya chunaavon main cambridge analitica kii dakhlandaji kii pichley saal ai khabaron ke baad sarkaar ne company ko notice jari kiya tha
 On April 3, 2018, Cambridge Analytica reported that it did not have any Facebook data for Indians
 vahiin iske vipareet fasebuk ne bharat sarkaar ko paanch april 2018 ko bataaya ki cambridge analitica ne install kiye gaye ap ke jariye kareeb 562,455 bharatiyon ke data tak pahunch banaai he
 The minister said that after conflicting claims between the two companies, the government again issued notice to them and asked them to clear the picture

 com / skms0dpk5q — iprashant tm 🇮🇳 (@ pk4323) January 21, 2018 Take care before taking a ticket to the Padmavat movie - Suresh Raigur (@raigursuresh) January 21, 2018 chautarafa hamale se ghir kar ek taraf jahaan iraq main ab iesas ke paanv ukhdane lage hai, vahiin duusari taraf uskaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi apane kaayar aatankwaadiyon kii fouj main nai jaan foonkane kii aakhri koshish kar rahaa he
 And this attempt is in the presence of an audio message, which Baghdadi has released to cheer up his warriors by running back in maidan-e-jung
 karaari shikast se ghabaraaya bagdadeeis audio massej kaa majamoon kuch yun he, 'itmeenaan rakho ki allaah har us shaks ko kamyaabi ata farmaayega jo uski ibaadat karegaa
 Be assured that you will definitely hear that our state is absolutely right
 hamaare khilaaf jitne hamale honge, ham utane hi paak honge or hamaari ekta utani hi badhegi
 We promise that whoever is participating in this war against ISIS, be it America, Russia, Israel or Europe, everyone will have to pay the price
 unhen pachhataanaa hoga
 'but the best news between Baghdadi's hooliganism and all the threats of ISIS is that after a face-to-face battle, ISIS has now suffered a severe defeat in Iraq
 bagdadi kii aawaaj kii pushti nahiiraq ke anbar provins kaa ek ahm shahar ramaadi ab iesas ke haath se nikal gaya he
 The city of Ramadi, which was occupied by ISIS in May 2014 i
e
 the last year and a half
 haalanki ramaadi par iraqi fouj ke kabje kii is nai khabar ke bich philhal khufia or suraksha agenciyaan is baat kii tasdik nahin kar saki he ki twitor accounts ke zarie relies kii gai ye aawaaj bagdadi kii hi he yaa nahin
 But experts are definitely seeing this as Baghdadi's nervousness
 darasal, ravivaar ko iraq main jo hua, vaisaa haal ke dinon main kabhi nahin hua tha
 While the us-led Coalition Forces was attacking ISIS targets, after receiving training from the US, Iraq's military forces also set up ISIS 'hideouts in the western part of the capital, Baghdad
 jameen-hawa kii dohari maar se pareshaan bagdadirmaadi ke kai hisson main aatankwaadiyon ke saath iraqi fouj kii tukdon main takaraahat chal rahi thi, lekin haal hi main nato mulkon ke fiter jetts ne aasmaan se jo hamale kiye usne aatankwaadiyon ko chhipane kaa bhi mauka nahin diya
 And on Sunday, when the Iraqi army moved forward to occupy the Provincial Government Complex, the entire building was emptied of terrorists
 haalanki isse pehle jo ikke-dukke aatankwaadi bache hue the, unhen fouj ne sabak sikhaa diya
 In a face-to-face battle in the Hauz area on Saturday, the army laid the bodies of 12 ISIS militants and blew up many such vehicles, which the terrorists were to use for further attacks
 counter terarysm ke pravaktaa al noman ne bataaya, 'hamane iesas par do tarafa hamale kiye
 On the ground, we were fighting face to face and from the sky, Air Force and Coalition countries attacked their targets
 hamane 12 aatankwaadiyon ko maar kiya or unke vaahan nasht kar die
 By the time we reached Ramadi to occupy the government building, the building was already empty of terrorists
 ' beshak, ye baat sahi ho ki iraq kaa ek bada ilaaka ab bhi aatankwaadiyon ke kabje main he, lekin ramaadi par iesas ke paanv ukhdane ko ek acchhee shuruyaat ke taur par to dekha hi ja rahaa he
 Surrounded by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-baghdadi is undoubtedly trying to prove himself absurd and uninterested with new audio, but the fact is that he has now been brought to life
 wo dum dabaa kar bhaag rahaa he
 Sometimes Iraq, sometimes Syria and sometimes Libya
 jaankaron kii maane to iraq se lekar syria tak islamic state ke khilaaf duniya ke tamaam mulkon ne jo morcha khol rakhaa he, use dekh kar lagata he ki aanevaale chand maheenon main hi iesas kaa safaya ho saktaa he
 And in such a situation, Baghdadi now has no option but to run away
 khabar ye he ki iraq or syria main kamjor padane ke baad ab bagdadi libya bhaag gaya he
 According to Iranian news agency FARC, Baghdadi has escaped from Syria to Raqqa to Libya
 use libya ke sirte shahar main dekha gaya he
 Sirte still remains the stronghold of ISIS in Libya, and Baghdadi does not currently see any other safe place to save its life
 bagdadi kii ye haalat isliye bhi he, kyonki iraq or syria donon hi mulkon main uske zyaadaatar bharosemand sipahasaalar maare ja chuke hai
 Baghdadi was also badly injured in the attack on his convoy in October in Iraq
 jiske baad use syria ke rakka shahar main apni surgery bhi karwaani padi thi
 But since the treatment there was not right, he had secretly reached Turkey
 lekin bataate hai ki jaise hi khufia agenciyon ko uske turki main hone kii bhanak lagi, wo turki se bhaag kar libya pahunch gaya
 How Baghdadi is constantly changing its location can be gauged from the fact that it was reported in January in Iraq and in June in Raqqa, Syria
 oktober main wo phir se iraq main tha, jabaki hamale ke baad wo vahaan se syria pahanchaa or phir turki se hota hua libya main ja chipa
 This rat race of Baghdadi is actually a proof of his constant encirclement in maidan-e-jung

 These girls have been brought from a private hostel in the city where they were living in inhumane conditions in a government hostel called Children with Special Needs (CWSN)
 state ajukeshan centre ko shikaayat mili thi ki post offis road sthit gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan brit star soshal sosayadi ke nijee hostel main bacchiyaan badtar halaat main rah rahi hai
 On December 15, the center team arrived here for an accidental investigation
 centre ke jila project koordinator ashok paradkar bataate hai, ''teen bacchon ke bich ek kambal diya gaya tha
 '' The hostel will get Rs 750 for every child from the government
 maheene milte the, lekin yahaan par bacchon ko moolbhoot suvidhaayen bhi muhaiyaa nahin karwaai gai thim
 The girls were also told by the team that the hostel workers beat them with sticks
 isaki shikaayat colector tak pahunchaai gai
 When the team of district officials reached this hostel on the night of 15 December, it was seen that the girls were chilling in the cold
 diksha naam kii ek bacchee gaayab thi
 According to Usha Chaturvedi, chairperson of the State Child Rights Protection Commission, "they did not even have basic facilities like clothes and bedding in private hostels

 media main ek bacchee ke gaayab hone kii khabar ai he
 But this news is false
 hostel main kul 48 bacchiyaan thim, jinamein se 18 apane ghar gai hui thim
 However, according to Avnesh Jafri, secretary of the hostel-running society, the issue has been overblown
 ve safai dete hue kehete hai, ''jaanch ko chapa bataa diya gaya or anupasthit bacchiyon ko laapata bataaya gaya
 During investigation these girls had gone to their house
 maamle kii jaanch puri hone dijie, sachaai khud-ba-khud saamne aa jaaegi
 "everything is not going well in the hostel, the district administration already knew about it
 sihor ke colector kavindra kiyavat bataate hai ki sanchaalkon se lambey arase se hostel ke halaat sudhaarney ke liye kaha ja rahaa tha
 In his words, "we didn't have space to have special children, that's why we had a contract with the NGO
" enjio ko kaaran bataao notice bhi jari kiya gaya tha jiskaa usne koi jawaab nahin diya
 Hence the contract with him was terminated
 ab hamaare paas bacchon ko rakhane ke liye jagah bhi he
 "it was also reported that as a punishment, the girls were sent to the boys' hostels at night
 lekin colector ke mutabik, ''hamen aisi koi bhi shikaayat nahin mili he
 "the reality of the case will be known only after the investigation report is received, but the wretched faces of those 30 girls sent to the new hostel are now smiling
" itnaa bhi kam nahin
 Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu has rejected the impeachment motion against the Chief Justice
 is par congress party ne abhi apane netaaon ko bayaan dene se manaa kiya he
 But, meanwhile, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala has targeted the Vice President only by tweeting
 surajevaala ne twit kar kaha ki mahabhiyog laane ke liye 50 saansadon kii jarurat hoti he, jo hamane puraa kiya
 The Rajya Sabha chairman cannot decide the merit of the proposal
 ab ye ladaai sidhe taur par loktantr ko bachaane vaale or loktantr ko khaarij karne waalon ke bich main he
 Constitutional process of impeachment is set in motion with 50 mp's giving the motion
 RS Chairman can’t adjudge the motion, for he has no mandate to decide the merits of the motion
 This is truly a fight between forces 'rejecting Democracy' and voices 'rescuing Democracy'
 1 / 3— Randeep Singh Surjewala (@rssurjewala)april 23, 2018unhone twit main likhaa ki prastaav aane ke kuch hi samay main vitt mantri ne ise revange petishan bataaya tha
 Which was a statement influencing the decision of the Rajya Sabha chairman
 rajyasabha chairman prashasnic shakti ke abhaav main is tarah kaa faisla nahin le sakate hai
 2 / 3within hours of 64 mp's submitting the impeachment motion, Leader of Rajya Sabha (FM) had expressed naked prejudice by calling it a 'revenge petition' virtually dictating the verdict to Rajya Sabha Chairman on that day
 Has ‘revenge Petition’ now become ‘rescue Order’?— Randeep Singh Surjewala (@rssurjewala)april 23, 2018is dauransurajevalane em
 Krishna Swamy cited the case
 surajevaala ne likhaa ki agar sabhi aarope jaanch se pehle hi khaarij ho jaaen to samvidhan or jaj incvaeri act kaa koi matlab nahin rahata he
 3 / 3RS Chairman can't decide on merits in absence of quasi judicial or administrative power (M
 Krishna Swami’s case)
 If all charges were to be proved before inquiry as RS Chairman suggests, Constitution & Judges (inquiry) Act will have no relevance
 Don’t muzzle Constitution— Randeep Singh Surjewala (@rssurjewala)april 23, 2018aapako bataa den ki congress kii aguwai main 7 vipakshi partiyon ne rajyasabha sabhapati ke saamne ye prastaav pesh kiya tha, lekin kanoonee salaah ke baad venkaiya naidu ne is prastaav ko khaarij kar diya he
 Venkaiah Naidu while delivering his judgment said that this impeachment brought against the Chief Justice is neither fair nor expected
 is prakaar kaa prastaav laate hue har pahalu ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 i reject this proposal only after taking all legal advice on this letter

 The impeachment party had given 5 reasons behind the impeachment motion
 kapil sibbal ne media se baat karte hue kaha tha ki nyaaypalika or lokantatr kii raksha ke liye ye jaruri tha
 1

 As both sides patrol the LAC according to their point of view, there is an encroachment

 iske baad inelo ke do dhado main bantane ke baad party ke vidhayak naina chautaala, vidhayak pirathi numberdaar, anup dhanak, rajbir faughat party se alag ho gaye
 Now only 8 mlas are left
 iskaa nateeja he ki haryana main duusare number kii rahi party se vidhansabha main vipaksh kaa pad bhi chhin gaya he
 Explain that Om Prakash Chautala is the National President of INLD
 chautaala or unke bade bete ajay singh junior basic training teachers bhartee main ghapala karne main 10 saal kii jail kii sajaa kaat rahe hai
 Chautala takes all the important decisions of the party from jail, but could not avoid political domination in the clan before the Lok Sabha elections
 om prakaash chautaala ke chote bete abhaya singh chautaala ke khilaaf bade bete ajay singh chautaala ne baghawat kar di
 Due to which Om Prakash Chautala drove Ajay Chautala and his two sons Dushyant and Digvijay out of INLD
 chautaala kunbe main raajnneetik varchasv kii jang main inelo do hisson main bant gai
 On one hand, Ajay Chautala formed the Jananayak Janata Party (JJP) with his two sons, on the other hand Abhay Chautala took the command of INLD with his father
 chautaala parivaar main raajnneetik bantwaare ke baad basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne inelo ke saath gathbandhan karne se manaa kar diya tha
 The result of two tearing of INLD just before the Lok Sabha elections was that INLD and JJP could not win a single parliamentary seat
 yahi nahin devilal kii chauthi peedi ke dushyant chautaala or digvijay chautaala jejepi se chunavi maidan main the, lekin modi lahar main apni seat nahin bachaa sake or aise hi abhaya chautaala ke netritv main utari inelo apana khaataa nahin khol saki
 While the INLD managed to win two seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 Now AAP leader Mayank Gandhi has targeted the party's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal by writing an open letter to the workers
 gandhi ne kaaryakartaaon ke naam par khulaa khat likhakar kal rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak kaa byora bhi saarvajanik kar diya he
 According to Gandhi, 'I was told on Wednesday night that if i disclose anything, disciplinary action will be taken against me
 ab jo ho, meri pehali nishtha satya ke prati he
 Here are the facts of the meeting about the dismissal of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan
 main rashtriya kaaryakarini se nivedan karuunga ki meeting ke minutes relies kiye jaaen
 'gandhi wrote,' On the night of 26 February, when members of the National Executive wanted to meet Arvind Kejriwal, Arvind gave the message that if these two members remain in the PAC, they will not be able to act as convenors
 4 march ko hui rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak kii yahi prishthbhumi thi
 'gandhi told,' During the Delhi election campaign, Prashant Bhushan had threatened several times that he would hold a press conference against the party as he had some objections on the selection of candidates
 hamamen se kuch log kisi tarah unhen chunaav tak shant rakhane main safal rahe
 It was alleged that Yogendra Yadav was conspiring against Arvind Kejriwal and some evidence was also presented
 arvind kejariwal or prashanth bhushan, yogendra yadav ke bich kabhi na mitane vaale matbhed ho chuke the
 The trust between them was also very low
 'bataur gandhi, 'yogendra yadav ne kaha ki wo samaj sakate hai ki arvind unhen PAC main nahin dekhnaa chaahate, ek saath kaam karnaa mushkil he isliye wo or prashanth pacse baahar rahenge lekin unhen baahar nahin kiya janaa chahie
 He introduced two formulas
 -PAC kaa punargathan ho or nae sadsy chune jaaen
 Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav will not present their candidature in the PAC elections
 -PAC apane vartmaan rup main hi kaam karti rahe or yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan kisi bhi meeting main hissaa nahin lenge
 Mayank Gandhi did not participate in the PAC voting on Wednesday and he has given the reason for this in his open letter
 unhone likhaa, 'arvind ko PAC main achche se kaam karne kii jarurat he
 So i agree that Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav can stay out of the PAC and take some other important roles
 main unhen saarvajanik rup se baahar rakhane ke prastaav ke virodh main tha or khaskar tab, jab ve khud hatane ko taiyaar the
 This decision to remove them was against the sentiments of activists around the world
 main is baat se sahamat tha ki wo PAC se baahar ja sakate hai, lekin iske peeche kii bhaavana or tarika mujhe sweekaarya nahin tha
 So i decided to be non-spot

 Meanwhile, the central government filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court, saying that the death penalty through lethal injection is more brutal than hanging
 is liye maut kii sajaa ke liye faansee hi behatar vikalp he
 Let me tell you, in the last hearing, the Supreme Court had asked the Central Government whether there could be any alternative method other than hanging in punishment-a-death
 iske baad centre sarkaar ne SC main halafanama daayar kiya he
 Better to be hanged in death sentence The Central Government in its affidavit filed in the Supreme Court said that hanging is a quick and safe method of capital punishment
 leethal injection or firing ke jariye maut kii sazaa dena amanviya or nrushans he
 The central government also said that the death penalty is given only in the rarest of rare cases
 lihaaja faansee kii sajaa behatar he
 Let me tell you, in the last hearing, the Supreme Court had said that in the punishment-a-death case, there is another way to be found other than hanging, in which death is in peace, not in pain
 sadiyon se ye kaha jaataa rahaa he ki penles deth kii koi barabari nahin
 In such a situation, due to the boom in science, other methods of death should be searched
 faansee maut kaa dardanaak tarika: yachikasupreme court main yachika daakhil kar kaha gaya he ki faansee kii jagah maut kii sazaa ke liye kisi duusare vikalp ko apanaaya janaa chahie
 The hanging has been sought to be pronounced as the most painful and barbaric way of death, injecting poison, firing a shot, gas chamber or electric shock
 yachika main kaha gaya he faansee se maut main 40 minute tak lagate hai, jabaki goli maarane or electric chair par keval kuch minute main maut ho jaati he

 tippaniyan "there is a shared interest in the leadership of Afghanistan and the success of the process of its own history," he said
 yah afghanistan ke samvidhan ke dhaanche ke bheetar or bina kisi hinsa ke hona chahie
 Modi said, this should strengthen the political, economic and social progress of the last 14 years and it should protect the rights and aspirations of all sections of society, including Afghan women

 Underlining the india-afghanistan partnership to flourish despite politics and geopolitical hurdles, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the common interests of both the leadership of Afghanistan and the success of its own proprietary Ikhtiyar, within the framework of Afghanistan's constitution and without any minor violence

 In the 18th edition of the India Today Conclave, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that some anti-nationals from within and outside are scared by India's might
 yah dar acha he
 Modi said in sharp words to the opponents that if Modi wants to protest, then definitely do it, remove the shortcomings in our plans, you will always be welcomed
 lekin desh ke suraksha hiton kaa virodh mat kariye
 Because your protest and news are used to protect terrorists on the international scene
 aap ye dhyaan rakhie ki modi virodh kii isi jid main masood ajahar or hafiz said jaise aatankiyon ko or aatank ke saraparaston ko sahaara mil rahaa he
 The blood of each brave soldier is precious for us

 Because if a youngster was martyred earlier, his blood flowed, then there was no major action in his response
 lekin ab koi bharat ko aankh dikhaane kaa saahas nahin kar saktaa he
 Rafael felt lacking
 
 
 piem modi ne kaha ki rafel kii kami aaj desh ne mahasoos kii he
 Today, India is saying in one voice that if we had Rafael, what would happen

 Now is the time for politicians to remain active in politics 24x7
 congress kii koshish bhi yahi he ki party netaa or kaaryakarta aam logon tak pahunchane ke liye jamini str par adhik se adhik pasinaa bahaate dikhen
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi wants to see this mindset at all levels in the party
 rahul ke congress adhyaksh banane ke baad se ek fark bhi dikhne laga he, pehle party ke ‘24, akbar road’ sthit mukhyalay main jo har vakt netaaon kaa jamaavada dikhataa tha, wo ab nahin dikhataa
 Most leaders are now seen pushing the heel peak in the field
 congress adhyaksh kaa sandesh saaf he jo parform karke dikhayega, usee ko inaam milegaa
 The Congress is going to start 'mission 2019' from April 29 in the midst of the heat of the Karnataka Assembly elections
 is din rahul dilli ke aitihaasik ramlila maidan main ‘janaakrosh raily’ ko sambodhit karenge
 Rahul will set the tone of the Congress campaign for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, with the Narendra Modi government showering on its failures
 is maukey par pradesh congress cametiyon ke mukhiyaaon ko bhi green signal diya jayega ki ve apane-apane pradeshon main khud ke taiyaar kiye hue shuruaati blue-prints par kaam shuru kar saken
 According to highly placed sources, the Congress has started searching for potential candidates for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 pradesh congress cametiyon ke adhyaksh is kaam main ji jaan se jute hai
 The party high command has asked them to make a list of potential candidates
 saath hi ye nirdesh bhi die gaye hai ki kisi ummidavaar ke naam par muhar lagane se pehle uski jeet kii kshamta par sabase adhik focus kiya jaae
 According to KC Venugopal, the party's in-charge for Karnataka, following the same as Rahul Gandhi had said in the party session, the party's dedicated workers would be given priority while choosing candidates
 telugana pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh uttam kumaar reddy kaa kahana he ki party kaa pradesh stareey netritv survey or yatra ke madhyam se har jile main sambhavit ummidavaaron kii kshamta ko aank rahaa he
 According to Reddy, he will urge the Congress president to get the green signal to declare the candidates' names only six months before the election
 isi tarah gujarat ke liye party prabharee or saansad rajeev saatav kaa kahana he ki rajya main campagne ke agle daur ke liye ranjaiti taiyaar kar lee gai he
 According to Satava, after the Navsarjan Yatra in Gujarat assembly elections last year, every work is being done in a professional manner
 saatav kehete hai, ‘ham rajya main apni yatra pehle hi puri kar chuke hai
 After the Navsarjan Yatra we get to know the ground reality
 ham ham campagne kaa aglaa daur shuru karenge jo andolan ke tevar main hoga
 Protests will be held from the block to the assembly level on issues that are troubling the people
 ’‘yatra’ he congress kaa nayaa mantragujrat main navasarjan yatra ko mili kamyaabi ke baad rahul gandhi karnataka main ‘jan aashirwad yatre’ ke jariye adhik se adhik logon tak pahunchane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Taking inspiration from this, the heads of the State Congress Committees and other veteran leaders will leave on their respective journeys after April 29
 madhya pradesh main party ke diggaj ‘nyaay yatra’ se pehle hi campagne kar rahe hai
 Former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda is going to start the Janakranti Yatra from Panipat in the month of May
 hooda kehete hai, ‘bijepi ne jo vaade kiye wo puure nahin kiye, is par logon main aakrosh he
 i will start the Janakranti Yatra from Panipat in May after getting instructions from the Congress President on 29 April
 koshish adhik se adhik logon tak pahunchane kii rahegi
 According to Telangana Congress State Committee President Uttam Kumar Reddy, he is going to start the journey by bus in the state from next month
 isse har nirvachan kshetra main jaakar ye jaanane main madad milegi ki jamini str par log kya sochate hai
 It will also help in knowing the potential of potential candidates
 congress kii kerala unit ke adhyaksh em em hasan bhi pehle se hi rajya main ‘janmochana yatra’ nikaal rahe hai
 The ruling Left Front in Kerala as well as the BJP is also being targeted through this yatra
 karnataka ke liye party prabharee venugopal kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi ke yatra model ke bahut achche parinaam saamne aae hai
 In this way, maximum public relations is being achieved in minimum expenditure
 ye tarika naa sirf party or aam logon main balki party ke andar bhi netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke bich duuri kam karne ko pul kii tarah kaam kar rahaa he
 Mission to strengthen the organization: BJP is in active mode since 2017 for its 'mission 2019'
 bijepi kii ore se kerala, pashchim bengal or purvottar ke liye nae lakshya tay karke vahaan party ko majboot banane ke liye haath-pair maare ja rahe hai
 Along the same lines, the Congress is eyeing the states considered to be BJP strongholds
 rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, gujarat, yahaan tak ki maharashtra par congress kaa khaas focus rahegaa
 It is also a reality that the Congress does not have a strong cadre like the BJP which can work at the booth level
 congress kii is kamajori ko beete kai rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main haar kii mukhya vajahon main se ek mana gaya he
 This is the reason that while appointing his general (state party chief) in different states on behalf of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, he is also being given a Gurmantra that along with strengthening the organization, booth management should be given the most importance
 venugopal kehete hai ki karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan party ke 8 lakh booth level kaaryakarta banaae gaye hai
 For Chhattisgarh, party in-charge PL Poonia is organizing a camp for booth level workers
 punia ke mutabik unhone party adhyaksh se aagrah kiya he ki ve in booth kaaryakartaaon se samvaad ke liye rajya kaa daura karen
 Poonia told that Rahul Gandhi will visit Chhattisgarh in May after the completion of Karnataka elections
 jharkhand ke liye congress prabharee arpyen singh ke mutabik party kaa lakshya sirf naa booth level sanghathan balki party ke duusare frontal sanghathanon or vibhaagon ko bhi majboot karnaa he
 Changes in Guards After changes in the leadership of the party organization in Madhya Pradesh and Goa, the Congress is going to make changes at the top level in the State Congress Committees in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Northeast soon
 gujarat prabharee rajeev saatav kaa kahana he ki sanghathan ko majboot banane ke liye block se lekar jila str, pradesh congress cameti str tak badlaav kiye ja rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi wants to give preference to potential youth as well as dedicated activists / leaders in the organization
 ucch padasth sutron ke mutabik naa sirf rajyon main party sanghathan ke mukhiya balki party ke kuch vibhaagon main bhi kartadharta badale jaaenge
 Even before the Lok Sabha elections are held, the preparations for the Congress are scheduled to be held in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in november-december this year
 aise bhi kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki loksabhaa chunaav samay se pehle hi teen rajyon ke chunaav ke saath hi karaae ja sakate hai
 On this, Congress leader Poonia says that if such a situation comes, then the Congress is ready to face it
 party kii yojana teenon rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke saath khud ko loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bhi taiyaar rakhane kii he
 According to the newly appointed chairman of Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee, Kamal Nath, priorities have been set for the state
 kamalnath ne kaha, ‘ham donon chunaav (vidhansabha-loksabhaa) ke liye saath taiyaari karenge
 They will take everyone along so that a strong fight can be fought on both fronts
 ’rashtriya ke saath sthaneey muddon par bhi jorcongress centre main modi sarkaar ko gherne ke liye rashtriya str ke muddon kii pahchaan ke saath kshetreey or jila str ke mudde bhi uthaane kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 The party is focusing on issues at the national level such as farmers' distress, rising unemployment, corruption, rising incidents of Dalit oppression, changes in SC-ST Act etc
 haal hi main rahul gandhi kii ore se shuru kii gai ‘samvidhan bachaao’ muhim ko isi se jod kar dekha ja saktaa he
 RPN Singh, the Congress in-charge for Jharkhand, says that local issues will be raised along with national issues
 jaise ki jharkhand main kaise bijepi netaaon ne adivaasiyon kii jameen par kabja jamaa liya
 According to Satava, people will be told that the Gujarat development model is completely failed and how only a few people were benefited through it
 baharhaal jo bhi he, congress ko ye pataa he ki bijepi main muqabla narendra modi-amit shah kii jodi se he jo ‘24x7’ kii sakriy raajnneeti main vishwaas rakhti he
 In such a situation, it is also the effort of the Congress that, whether it is sunny or rainy, leaders and workers from the top to the bottom of the party should work among the people at all times so that the lost ground of the Congress's base is recovered again

 According to reports, the state's command can be handed over to Nitish Kumar once before the assembly elections in october-november
 samajha ja rahaa he ki is babat lalu prasad ne bhi jediu ko hari jhandi de di he
 BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi has also claimed that Nitish Kumar can become CM by replacing Jitan Ram Manjhi before 15 February
 angreji akhbaar 'indian express' kii khabar ke mutabik, jediu adhyaksh sharad yadav ne pichley dinon lalu prasad se mulaakaat kii or maujuuda halaat par vichaar kiya
 RJD chief Lalu Prasad said that the JDU has the right to choose its leader and he supported the party because it wants to stop 'communal forces'

 On the other hand, the JDU government has also suffered a lot due to the boisterousness of Manjhi and rhetoric in support of Narendra Modi for the last few days

 On Monday, Lalu Prasad said in favor of Nitish, 'he left his post to pursue a Dalit
 aise main nitish ko samarthan dena banataa he
 Lalu further said that he does not know whether Nitish wants to become CM again or not, but if the JDU Legislative Party elects him leader, he will support him

 Aparajita, a political science student at Hindu College, has been associated with the All India Students Federation since the age of 13, but she entered politics only after coming to college last year
 unhone kaha ‘‘jab meri maa mujhe apane samay ke chaatr andolan ke kisse bataatin thim, to main sochati thi ki kaash main bhi unke saath rahi hoti
 "aparajita is also clear about the fact that, even though her parents are old players of politics, a leader has to make his own way
 dusu chunaav teen sitambar ko hone hai
 There are a total of 11 candidates for the post of president
 vahiin upaadhyaksh, sachiv or sanyukt sachiv pad ke liye kul 30 pratyaashee maidan main hai
 Harish Chaudhary from Indian National Students' Organization for the post of President, while Jitendra Chaudhary from Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad
 rus ke raashtrapati vladimir putin ne bharat daure ke pehle hi din bharat ko 12 parmaanu riector dene kii ghoshnaa kii, usee din tel kii keemten 60 america dollar se bhi neeche aa gayi, or aane vaale dinon main uske 35 se 40 dollar ke bich pahunchane kii ummid he
 This made this nuclear deal less attractive
 isse yah bhi jaahir hota he ki urja sambandhi jaruraton ke liye petroleum padaarthon kii jagah aanvik urja kaa vikalp abhi sambhav nahin he
 In the current circumstances, Modi should be advised to ask Putin how Russia can help India become a part of the Asian gas and oil community network, rather than giving India nuclear support
 lekin chunki aisi kisi sambhaavna kii ore kisi kaa dhyaan nahin gaya, isliye ise samajhane kii jarurat he
 Molecular energy currently provides only 1-2% of India's total energy consumption, if you look too much, this figure is not going to increase more than 6% by 2050
 aise main hamaari praathmik jarurat aanvik urja nahin, balki jeevashm se milane vaali urja hi he
 Secondly, the way we have seen in Kudankulam is that it can always be difficult to find space for molecular plants and it will increase in the coming days
 abhi koi bhi parmaanu urja kii mukhaalafat nahin kar rahaa he, lekin inamen se har shaks apane aasapaas parmaanu sanyantr lagane kii yojana kaa virodh karegaa
 We have seen this happen in Jaitapur in Maharashtra and also in West Bengal
 phukushima ke udhaaharan se yah bhi saaf he ki japan jaise ati viksit desh, jahaan audyogic vikaas kii hi samskruti he or behad anushaasit work force he, main bhi parmaanu haadase ho sakate hai, jiskaa asar dashakon tak aane vaali pidiyon par bhi bana rahata he
 In the face of such accidents, a small accident begins to appear in the Bhopal gas scandal
 yahi vajah he ki america ke thri mil dweep ke parmaanu sanyantr main 1979 main hue haadase ke baad desh ke sabhi parmaanu sanyantron ko band kar diya gaya, or ve beete chaar dashak se band hi pade hai
 Germany, industrially among the world's most developed countries, does not have any fossil fuel of its own, but decided after the Fukushima accident that it would phase out all of its nuclear plants, and no new ones
 And will be completely dependent on fossil fuels and renewable energy
 france abhi iklauta desh he, jo parmaanu urja par nirbhar he, lekin uske paas suraksha ke paryaapt upaay hai or algeria se pipeline ke jariye paryaapt gas kaa bhandar bhi, lekin bharat jaise desh ke liye 12 nae roosi parmaanu sanyantron kaa matlab maut ke tandav kaa khatra 12 guna badhane jaisaa he
 Third, Barack Obama has made it clear that the country will not accept the risk of any harm to the American environment
 haal hi main mexico kii khadi main tel khanan se upje sankat ke chalate (isamen kisi insaan kii maut nahin hui, lekin kuch sil kii maut jarur hui thi) 68 arab dollar kaa harjaana bharna padaa tha
 At the same time, India was able to recover damages of just $ 480 million from Union Carbide even after hundreds of people died and thousands of people were affected
 iske baavjood, parmaanu durghatana kii sthiti main jabaavadehi vaala kanoon kaaphi kathor mana ja rahaa he, vah bhi tab, jab ekmaatr america nirmaataa company bharat main aanvik sanyantr kii aapurti kar rahi he
 Fourthly, Russia's nuclear deal has come at a time when petroleum prices are falling sharply, so nuclear energy is starting to look expensive
 aise main jarurat is baat kii he ki kyon na duniya bhar ke tel or gas kii bazaar keemton main sthayitv laayaa jaae
 Since Russia is a major producer of natural oil and gas, Modi should have talked to Putin about the possibilities of supplying oil and gas resources from Russia, which he did not
 aisa unhen do anya pahaluon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue karnaa chahie tha
 The first aspect is that the production of oil and gas resources in Russia is going to increase, because instead of western Russia, its production from the Siberian field is going to increase
 vaise bhi roosi siberia ko uttari asia kaa hissaa maanate hai
 We should have taken care of it
 itnaa hi nahin, sakhalin ke jis dweep par oengisi or beepi kaa plant sthapit ho rahaa he, vah asia main sthit he, europea rus main nahin
 Not only this, Russia still has a deep impact on the petroleum sector, especially on its former federal states - Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan - in which oil and gas are available in plenty
 inhen sroton se china apni tel or gas sambandhi adhiktar jaruraton ko puraa karata he, lekin abhi bhi kaaphi kuch baaki he
 We should actively participate in oil diplomacy in Central and North Asian
 isaki sambhaavna bhi badi he, kyonki ukraine ke saath rus ke vivaad ke baad pashchimi deshon ne roosi eendhanon kaa bycott shuru kiya he
 Due to the falling oil prices in the international market, Russia needs to find a trusted partner and there can be no better partner than India who has lived up to the trust many times
 lekin aisa jaan padataa he ki modi or putin kii baatcheet main petroleum tel par koi charchaa tak nahin hui
 By focusing only on nuclear plants, Modi has given Russia the option of a huge market for nuclear plants, but they will not only fulfill our energy needs, but will also increase the risk of nuclear accidents in the country
 darasal, modi ke salaahkaaron ko petroleum tel or prakritik gaison ke jeeyo-politics ko samajhnaa hoga
 Asia is the largest producer of petroleum oil and natural gas
 itnaa hi nahin, yah tel or prakritik gas kaa sabase teji se badhata bazaar bhi he, kyonki satat vikaas ke liye eendhan kii bhukh kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 As a result, there is a need to create an Asian petroleum and gas community
 isamen asian gas grid kii sthapana ko praathamikta di jaani chahie
 From India's point of view, the first phase of such a grid is the construction of a paved road or under-sea technology route between India and Iran
 samudr ke neeche kaa rasta bhi ab sambhav he
 Such a gas pipeline could later be extended to Qatar and other Gulf countries
 ise iraq tak le jaaya ja saktaa he or ek pramukh line ko ajarbaijan se jod sakate hai
 We should speed up the construction of the turkmenistan-afghanistan-pakistan-india (TAPI) pipeline on the lines of the Western Gas Network, which requires border determination as well as the necessary political will
 agar in sroton ko puraa kiya jaae to bharat ko jarurat se zyaada tel or gas kii aapurti sambhav hogi
 If this pipeline reaches southwest China via Myanmar, there will be more benefit
 pashchimi or madhya asian gaison ko bharat main laane ke liye hamen jitna kharch karnaa hoga, usase zyada ham kama sakate hai
 To promote this pan-asian project, we need to extend TAPI to the port of Ashtrakhan, located on the Caspian Sea in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia
 agar asatrakhaan prastaavit asian gas grid kaa hub banataa he to madhya asia ke duusare desh is krantikari network se judane ke prati zyada aashwast ho paaenge
 As far as North Asia is concerned, the gas pipeline from Siberia or Sakhalin to India may not be technically feasible, but another arrangement between India and Korea and India and Japan is possible
 ham unhen uttar asia ke apane anubandhit centre (saakhlin) se gas kii aapurti kar denge or uske badale ham unke indonesia yaa phir australian centre se alenji hasil kar sakate hai
 To achieve all this, a Nehruvian approach would be needed, which was started by Nehru in March 1947 with the holding of the Asian Relations Conference in India
 tab ham puri tarah swatantra bhi nahin hue the
 Asia has been leading the development of human civilization in the world since ancient times, while the colonialism of Europe started just 300 years ago
 lekin nehru kii 1947 kii pahal ke baavjood asia sabase zyada vibhajit mahadweep rahaa he
 The reason for this - despite colonialism being on the path of development in Asia, Asia remained the playground for large world powers, especially in the late 20th century and the 21st century
 yah sthiti badalani hi chahie
 We need to take lessons from Europe
 kis tarah unhone pehle european kol and steel samudaay banaaya, phir european kaaman market, iske baad europea samudaay or ab european union
 Although the talk of such an Asian union is still a century or so away, we can move towards that goal, and the establishment of an Asian gas grid may be the first step in this direction
 asian union ke gathan kii disha main asian tel evam prakritik gas samudaay kaa gathan pehla kadam hoga
 But how will India be able to do all this when it wants to become a Hindu nation by promoting Hinduism
 
 
 ? ye kaise ho paaegaa, jab desh kii satta kaa niyantran sakshi maharaj or sadhvi jyoti jaise netaaon ke haathon main hoga
 
 
 The Can we start by including all the attitudes under the dreams of the father of our foreign policy
 
 
 ? aise main bahut achraj nahin hona chahie ki modi un parmaanu sanyantron ko kharidne ko hi praathamikta denge, jise koi doosraa khareednaa nahin chahta

 At an election rally in mp's Hoshangabad, Kamal Nath said that Narendra Modi's mentality is to kill
 bataa den ki isse pehle hoshangabad main hi piem narendra modi ne kaha tha ki congress to ab modi ko maarane tak ke sapane dekhne lagi he
 In a meeting held here in support of the Congress candidate, Chief Minister Kamal Nath said, "prime Minister Modi says that the Congress wants to kill him (modi), Prime Minister, we want to say that the kill-and-kill mentality is not the Congress, this mentality is Yours, what you say, we want to send Modi home, let him rest, you have cheated the people of the country, the people of Madhya Pradesh for five years

 This delegation will apprise Prime Minister Modi about various issues related to the state, especially development projects
 yah mulaakaat kaaphi myne rakhti he, kyonki pratinidhamandal ek maheene baad pradhanmantri se milane ja rahaa he
 Significantly, a month ago, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) did not allow the meeting and a huge political controversy had erupted over the issue
 bataa den ki piemo 4 baar pradhanmantri modi se milane ke vijayan ke anurodh ko thukraa chukaa he
 Earlier on 20 March 2017, Kerala CM Nemodise had asked for an appointment
 lekin tab bhi vijayan ko modi se mulaakaat kii ijaajat nahin mili thi
 Before that, on 24 November 2016, after demonetisation, Vijayan also sought an appointment with Modi

 In which several issues such as violence between Left and RSS workers were discussed in Kerala

 The crowded markets, hotels, trains and all the places where a large number of people are present are on the target of terrorists
 ye chetavanee ai he america se
 The US State Department has issued a warning to its citizens residing in India and has advised to be vigilant
 isamen kaha gaya he ki america sarkaar ko lagaataar suchanaaen mil rahi hai ki aatankwaadi sanghathan bharat main hamale kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 After 26 / 11, the terrorists in Pune this year have revealed their strength and intentions
 in hamalon se ye bhi saafe ho gaya he ki aatankwaadi aisi jagahon ko khaas taur par nishaanaa banaate hai jahaan america or duusare pashchimi mulkon ke nagarikon kii maujuudagi hoti he
 Earlier, the United States had issued a similar warning on 29 January
 US ne maangi sabase zyada khaaton kii jaankariapraadh, ghrinaa or aatank failaane waalon kii nigaraneefasebuk is saal 5
 Has closed 4 billion fake accounts
 soshal media plateform kii ore se buudhvaar ko jari kii gai taaja report main kaha gaya ki afvaahon or tathyon ko tod-marod ke pesh kiye jane se rokane ke liye yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 Facebook has said that we are improving our capabilities to identify and block accounts that spread lies and indecency
 soshal media plateform ne kaha ki har roj ham in tareekon ke jariye lakhon phek acounts kii pahchaan karte hai
 Facebook believes that through fake accounts, a person pretends to be someone who does not exist
 network kii ore se kaha gaya he ki vah saamaajik or raajnneetik agenda ke liye logon ko dhokhe main rakhane vaale khaaton kii pahchaan or unhen band karne par zyada dhyaan de rahe hai
 This report has also discussed in detail the demand of the accounts of the users from the US innovators in seeking details

 The US has sent 50,741 applications in this regard, seeking information on 82,461 accounts
 fasebuk ne kaha ki ham sarkaron kii ore aae har aavedan kii kanoonee nigaraanee karte hai or sunishchit karte hai ki vah vaid hi ho
 The report also provides information on ways to deal with Facebook posts related to terrorism, hate, suicide, child porn and drugs
 fasebuk ne kaha ki takanic ekadam unnat nahin he or galtiyaan ab bhi ho sakati hai
 This is the reason why we are removing the accounts which violate our policies by investing more and are constantly moving towards making ourselves accurate
 nepal main ravivaar ko nayaa samvidhan lagu ho gaya he
 Although the parliament there rejected the proposal of Hindu Rashtra, but the ongoing opposition to the implementation of this constitution became even more vocal as soon as it was implemented
 bharat se lage tarai ke ilaakon se hinsak jhadpon kii khabaren ain
 There was a constant fear of this
 madhesi bhi lagaataar is samvidhan kaa virodh karte rahe hai kyonki unhen lagata he ki is samvidhan main unke saath bhedbhaav hua he
 This is the reason why just two days before the Constitution came into force, India's Home Secretary S
 Jaishankar visited Nepal
 vahaan par unhone naa sirf alag-alag partiyon ke netaaon se mulaakaat kii balki pradhanmantri susheel koirala se bhi mulaakaat kii
 Jaishankar said that India is in favor of the new constitution and hopes that the leaders of Nepal will show such flexibility and maturity in this matter that the constitution will be carried by all and will be valid for all
 ye bhi kaha ki bharat chahta he ki nayaa samvidhan lagu hone kaa mauka khushi or santosh kaa ho naa ki virodh or hinsa kaa
 But that is what was expected
 jahaan adhiktar nepal main jashn kaa maahaul rahaa, tarai ke hisson main karfu lagu karnaa padaa, sena lagaani padi
 India is very concerned about this
 bhartiya samay ke mutabik shaam kareeb paanch baje ek samaaroh main raashtrapati rambaran yadav ne nae samvidhan ke lagu hone kaa elaan kiya
 Shortly thereafter, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs kept a close watch on the situation at 6
10 am, saying that we have seen that the new constitution has come into force but we are worried about violence in many parts of the country
 ummid karte hai ki hinsa or dabaav mukt maahaul main baatcheet se samasya suljhegi or shanti or vikaas kii neenv padegi
 People in the Terai hoped that India would intervene in these situations, but it is so clear that in the changed time, India may not directly fall into this matter
 tippaniyan The kind of policy of India which has been in Nepal till now has become an image of Big Brother, which has become quite unpopular
 modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad ab ye chhavi sudhaarney kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 After becoming the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has visited Nepal twice
 ek vajah ye bhi he ki nepal china ke kaaphi kareeb aa gaya he
 China is not only investing in Nepal, but the process of laying the rail line directly from there to Kathmandu is also going on
 bharat nahin chahta ki ek or sarhad uske liye sirdard ban jaae
 Therefore, in this whole matter, he will take steps to blow up so that better relations with Nepal are not affected and the Government of Nepal should also take steps towards solving the problem of Madhesis
 is baat kii ashanka lagaataar bani hi hui thi
 Madhesi has also consistently opposed this constitution because he feels that he has been discriminated against in this constitution
 yahi vajah he ki samvidhan lagu hone ke thik do din pehle bharat ke grih sachiv es jaishankar nepal gaye
 There, he not only met the leaders of different parties but also met Prime Minister Sushil Koirala
 jaishankar ne kaha ki bharat nae samvidhan ke haq main he or ummid karata he ki nepal ke netaa is maamle main itnaa lacheelaapan or paripakvata dikhaaenge ki samvidhan sabko saath lekar chalane vaala or sabko maanya hoga
 It also said that India wants that the opportunity to implement the new constitution should be of happiness and satisfaction and not of protest and violence
 lekin hua vahi jisaki ashanka thi
 While there was a festive atmosphere in most of Nepal, curfew was imposed in parts of the Terai, the army had to impose
 bharat isse kaaphi chintit he
 According to Indian time, President Rambaran Yadav announced the implementation of the new constitution in a ceremony at around 5 pm
 uske kuch hi der baad, 6 bajkar 10 minute par halaat par lagaataar najar rakhe bhartiya videsh mantralay kaa bayaan aayaa ki hamane dekha he ki nayaa samvidhan lagu ho gaya he lekin desh ke kai hisson main hinsa se ham chintit hai
 We hope that dialogue in violence and pressure free environment will solve the problem and lay the foundation for peace and development
 tarai main logon ko ummid thi ki bharat in halaat main hastkshep karegaa lekin itnaa saaf he ki badale hue vakt main bharat sidhe taur par is maamle main shaayad naa pade
 The comments bharat kii jis tarah kii niti ab tak nepal main rahi he uski chhavi big brother vaali bani jisase wo kaaphi alokapriy ho chukaa he
 After the coming of the Modi government, efforts are being made to improve this image
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad narendra modi do-do baar nepal kaa daura kar chuke hai
 One reason is that Nepal has come very close to China
 china naa sirf nepal main nivesh kar rahaa he balki vahaan se sidhe kathmandu tak rail line bichaane kii prakriya bhi chal rahi he
 India does not want another border to become a headache for her
 isliye is puure maamle main wo phoonk phoonk kar kadam rakhega taaki nepal se behatar hote rishton par bhi aanch naa aae or madhesiyon kii samasya sulajhane kii taraf bhi nepal sarkaar kadam uthaae

 ek ore pipipi ke paas koi lokapriy netaa nahin he jo chunaav prachaar kaa netritv kar sake
 On the other hand, there are serious disagreements on whether Bilawal should be spent so early on the political front at the beginning of his political career
 bilaval yuva or vichaaron se las hai jo khud ko bhutto kii viraasat kaa uttaradhikari samajhate hai
 So far, his political test has not been done, but if the PPP has any political future, it will be in Bilawal itself
 agar bilaval ko kuch bhi hua, to jaradaari na sirf apana betaa kho denge balki pipipi kaa rajnatik suraj bhi dub jayega
 The security concerns being raised about Bilawal are not lies
 is baar pakistan ke chunaav main pipipi ke sir par haar mandara rahi he, lihaaja vah bilaval ko 2018 ke chunaav ke liye bachaakar rakhana chaahegi
 The future of the PPP is the only question in Bilawal's mind is whether Bilawal will stop the campaign for the general election to be held on 11 May
 pipipi ko sarkaar banane ke liye 342 sadasyon vaali assembly main 172 siton kii jarurat hogi
 According to sources close to the PPP, after much discussion, it was decided in January that Bilawal will not be brought to the fore and his career will be destroyed
 yah sochi-samajhi or tarkpurna ranneeti thi
 If the PPP could not form the government after the election, it would be a good opportunity for Bilawal to take command of the party in his hand and sit in the opposition and learn the tricks of politics till the next election
 pradhanmantri ke purv salaahkaar pipipi ke choudhary fawaad hossain kehete hai, ''pipipi peedigat badlaav se guzar rahi he, aise main pita or putr ke kaam karne ke tareeke or nazariye main fark hoga
 Bilawal is still a young man, but he has seen politics more closely than others of his age
 ve apni maa marhoom mohatarama benazir bhutto ke saae tale paley-bade hai
 He has also been a part of many important diplomatic meetings, so his dealings with politics are of some other kind
 mujhe lagata he ki ve media main hone vaali aalochanaon ko lekar sanjeeda hai or siyasat ko lekar unka najariya maujuuda pipipi netritv ke mukaable kahin zyada adarshavaadi he
 "the election's open market may be far more clean and fair than the elections held since 1970 because the caretaker government in March has a neutral character
" pipipi kii sabase badi uplabdhi yahi he ki deshbhar main uske ummidavaar hai
 Zardari himself cannot enter the campaign because he is the President and the court prevents him from standing on any political side
 kuch logon ko ummid he ki pipipi kii deshbhar main pahunch or sanghathan he, lihaaja navaj sharif kii pakistan muslim lig-navaj (piemail-en), purv cricketer imran khan kii pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitii) or duusare virodhiyon ke mukaable uski sthiti mukhyadhara kii partiyon main acchhee he
 Some more experts believe that it will not perform according to its reach and structure
 varisht patrkaar iftikhar ahamed kehete hai, ''pipipi ek haari hui jang lard rahi he kyonki party ke bheetar or baahar, donon hi jagah uske ravaie main sanjidagi nahin he
 According to her leadership claims, she will not be able to perform, but Zardari will be in a bargaining position with whichever party gets the majority, so they can save themselves
 ”sindh pipipi kaa paaramparik garh rahaa he or is baar bhi yahi sthiti bani rahegi baavjood iske ki vahaan prashasan khastahal he
 PPP will continue to be the largest party in Sindh, barring sporadic losses from the anti-incumbency
 asli jang punjab main hogi
 The party has been steadily losing ground in central and northern Punjab since 1977, despite Yusuf Raza Gilani, who served as prime minister for four years under his five-year rule, himself from southern Punjab
 bada sawaal yah he ki kya pipipi ko dakshini punjab main mil rahaa samarthan tikaa rah sakegaa? party kii haar yaa jeet kaa faisla vahiin hoga
 Some people also say that despite the PML (N) government's discrimination against Southern Punjab, it will perform better than the PPP because Nawaz Sharif has shown his dream of good governance to the people there
 pipipi agar chunaav main haar bhi gai or 70 se zyada siten laa saki, tab bhi apana rajnatik aadhaar banaae rakhane main kaamyaab ho jaaegi
 But in the event of winning less than 70 seats, his political existence will be questioned
 patrkaar or rajnatik vishleshak nusrat javed kehete hai, ''mujhe nahin lagata ki vah (pipipi) agali sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 They themselves would also know this
 ”tede-medhe samikarbais puure khel main imran khan wild card kii tarah hai, jo pipipi ke nahin balki sharif ke swaabhaavik pratidwandvi hai
 The Hazara division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including central and northern Punjab, is a traditional stronghold of the PML (N), but this time it is facing a challenge from Imran's tehreek-e-insaf that could emerge as the third largest party
 yah sab kuch votaron ke gharon se baahar nikalne par hi tay hoga
 Journalist Khalid Ahmad says, "imran Khan's strategy is based on the idea of victory from a divine inspiration
 navaj sharif kii ranneeti chunaav vishleshkon kii bhavishyavaaniyon par tiki he
 Zardari's strategy is more practical and concrete as it rests on the possibility of defeat
 ” jaradaari ko sansad main bane rahane kii ummid philhal imran or sharif ke bich maujuud nafrat se nikalakar aa rahi he
 At most, it is likely that Imran will not tie up with the PML (N)
 pipipi kisi se bhi gathjod karne ko baaki do kii banisbat zyada khuli hogi
 If this is possible, then Zardari can once again decide to become president
 yah yaad rakhana chahie ki raashtrapati ke pad par rahete hue hi ve bhrashtachar ke maamalon se bhi bache rahe sakenge or kam-se-kam yah khwaahish to jagajaahir he

 However, there are many houses and plots for sale

 The Lisadi Gate crossroads gets jammed

 islamic madrasa 'daarul ulum, devband' ne online fatwa jari kar bhartiya vayusena ke ek adhikari ko salaah di he ki agar use dadhi rakhane kii ijaajat nahin di ja rahi he or uski khud kii aarthik sthiti majboot he to wo naukari chhod de
 What did the Air Force officer ask? Actually, this officer had asked for advice on the Nedarul Uloomki website
 is adhikari ne likhaa tha ki jab usne bhartiya vayusena ko jwine kiya tha tab uski dadhi nahin thi
 But now after completing 10 years of the job, he wants to shave but this is not being allowed by the Air Force
 ab aise main use har din shev kar duty par janaa padataa he
 The officer asked what he should do in these circumstances, should he leave the job or continue shaving everyday? Did Darul Uloom Deoband respond? In response to the officer's question, the Madrasa said, 'if you are financially Are strong and if you can find another way to earn money to run a house then leave the job
 or agar aap paise kamaane kaa doosraa rasta nahin dhund sakate to aap ye naukari jari rakhen or allaah se maafee maangate rahen
 Also, keep looking for other jobs that you deserve

 The Constitution of India also has the freedom to follow the customs of its religion
 mufti faruki ke mutabik is adhikari ke seniors phir bhi nahin maanate to phir is adhikari ko court janaa chahie
 Mufti Farooqui said that if a senior pressures not to shave, then legal action should be taken against him and he should be fired
 mufti faruki ne kaha, "is desh main sabase bada ohada pradhanmantri kaa he
 Dr
 Manmohan Singh, who had a beard in this post, remained for many years
 maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi halki dadhi rakhte hai
 In such a situation, it is against the constitution of India to tell an officer not to shave

 In such a situation, AAP convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has changed his political agenda in view of next year's assembly elections
 ab dilli main apane siyaasi kile ko bachaane ke liye kejariwal ne kavayad tej kar di he
 Arvind Kejriwal has played a master stroke before the Delhi Assembly elections
 pichley chunaav main bijli half kaa naaraa dekar satta main aane vaale kejariwal ne is baar puraa maaf kaa naaraa diya he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that no bill of any kind will have to be paid for spending power up to 200 units
 iske alaava sarkaar ne desh main sabase sasti bijli dene kaa elaan kiya he
 Kejriwal said that electricity bills up to 200 units of consumption are waived
 200 se 400 bijli unit tak kharch karne par sarkaar 50 fisadi sabsidi degi
 He said that due to our clear intention, there has been a huge decline in electricity bills
 koi bhi aisa rajya nahin he, jab bijli bill ke daam nahin bade hon, lekin dilli main bijli ke bill nahin bade hai
 This is nothing short of a miracle
 aaj bijli companiyon ke paas cash he, unke ghate kam ho rahe hai
 The Kejriwal government of Delhi has cut the electricity rates giving great relief to the common people
 kejariwal ne 200 unit kii bijli bill puri tarah se maaf kar diya he
 Whereas till now, 408 rupees had to be paid for 200 units
 kejariwal ke elaan ke baad ab 200 unit kharch karne par kisi tarah kaa koi bill kaa bhugtan nahin karnaa hoga
 Let us tell you that in the last election Kejriwal had given the slogan of 'pani pardon-electricity half' in the last election
 dilli kii janata bijli katautee kii killat or bijli ke bilon se pareshaan thi
 In such a situation, the people of Delhi expressed confidence in Kejriwal's promise and won 67 out of 70 assembly seats
 kejariwal ne mukhyamantri banate hi dilli ke har parivaar ko 700 litre rojaanaa pani muft dene kaa chunavi vaada puraa kiya tha
 Apart from this, Kejriwal gave big discount to the people of Delhi by halving the electricity rates
 yahi nahin bijli katautee main bhi kejariwal ne bada sudhaar hua he
 In the last four years, people have got relief from summer power cuts
 ab kejariwal ne vidhansabha chunaav se pehle 200 unit bijli bill maaf karne kaa elaan kiya he
 In such a situation, it will be seen whether Kejriwal's bet will win the hearts of the people of Delhi once again

 Rahul Gandhi does not consider Nitish's stance in the presidential election a matter of concern
 rahul kii pahal par hi congress pravaktaa singhvi ne nitish par naram rukh apanaaya tha
 Rahul Gandhi is confident that Nitish will stay together and there is no threat to the coalition government in Bihar
 up raashtrapati ke ummidavaar par bhi hogi batsutron ke mutabik rahul maanate hai ki raashtrapati or uparashtrapati ke chunaav main nitish kaa rukh zyaada myne nahin rakhata or nitish bas lalu par ankush rakhane ke liye aisa kar rahe hai
 The ongoing affairs of Lalu and his family will not affect the alliance at present
 gauratlab he ki rahul gandhi chhuttiyaan manaane ke liye videsh gaye the
 It was during Rahul's stay abroad that tensions grew between Nitish and the Congress due to Nitish's changed attitude
 rahul ne lautate hi rishte saamaanya karne kii kavayad shuru kar di he
 According to sources, Rahul has conveyed the message to Nitish through his messenger
 raashtrapati chunaav main vipaksh ke ummidavaar kii vakaalat karte-karte nitish kumaar ne endie ke ummidavaar ke samarthan kaa elaan kar diya
 The initial preparations for opposition unity in 2019 were stalled
 bihar main laluor congress ke samarthan se chal rahi mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar par khatra dikhne laga
 Meanwhile, angry with Nitish's stance, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad launched a scathing attack on Nitish, while Nitish's spokesman KC Tyagi on the other hand retaliated
 khud nitish ne bhi ek kadam aage badhate hue kaha diya ki wo congress ke pichhalggu nahin hai
 After this, the question arose whether the days of the Grand Alliance were completed? In the presidential election, the name of the opposition candidate Meira Kumar was announced and Rahul Gandhi was abroad at the time of his nomination
 rahul ko hi nitish ke saath congress ke gathbandhan kii mukhya vajah mana jaataa he
 Rahul's close admits that if in 2019 when it comes to making another leader of the opposition PM, Rahul's first choice may be Nitish
 isse bhi rahul or nitish kii aapasi samaj kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, when Rahul returned from abroad, the Congress officially relaxed his attitude
 darasal, sutron ke mutabik rahul ko ye bharosa he ki raashtrapati chunaav main nitish ne bihar ke rajyapal hone ke naate bhale hi kovind kaa samarthan kiya ho lekin wo endie main nahin jaaenge
 Also, Nitish has taken these steps to keep a check on Lalu

 The question is just how do you create a rapport with them
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘main team ke sadasyon ke bich majboot dostana maahaul bananaa chahta hum
 We live together 250–280 days a year, so i want to create such an atmosphere that for the next ten years, from outside we can see that this team is completely united

 wo ek tarah kii cricket khelnaa chaahate hai
 He is going as a Test captain on the tour of Bangladesh
 unhone kaha, ‘main unhen kisi bhi prakaar kii asuraksha bhaavana yaa andeh se mukt rakhana chahta hum
 If you see Australia playing in the field, then you would definitely like to have a similar team
 wo ek unit ke rup main khelte hai
 We have to give our best to defeat them

 i want teams to defeat us, this is what i want
 ye bas mindset kii baat he

 ’kohli yaad karte hai us din ko jab unhone bataur captain team ko sambodhit kiya tha, yah baat australia daure par pehle test se thik pehle kii he, ‘hotel main yah meeting manager ke kamare main hui thi
 i told the boys that if any of you are going to Australia with this mindset that i have to score two hundreds or take five wickets in an innings twice or three times, then get it out of your mind

 chaar saal pehle iraq ke mosul se agava hue 39 bhartiya naagarik maare ja chuke hai
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj herself informed this to the Parliament
 2014 main bharat se mosul main kaam karne gaye mazdooron ko aatankiyon ne agava kar liya tha
 When they tried to escape, ISIS militants surrounded and killed them
 haalanki, bandhakon main se apni jaan bachaakar bharat lautne vaale harjit messiah ne pehle hi daawa kiya tha ki baaki sabhi 39 bhartiya maar die gaye hai
 But the government refused to accept his claim
 pichley saal july main videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne saaf kah diya ki jab tak saboot nahin mil jate, wo agava kiye bharatiyon ko mrit nahin maan saktin
 Now the Foreign Minister of India wants the identification of 39 dead bodies in four years to be considered a success of the Government of India
 lekin congress ne sarkaar par hamalaa bol diya he
 The Congress has questioned the government's delay and asked its reason
 darasal, bharat ke 39 kaamgaar iraq ke shahar mosul main naukari karte the
 In June 2014, when the people of Baghdadi stormed Mosul, they could not leave and were caught in the clutches of ISIS
 jabaki harjit messiah jaan bachaakar bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab rahe
 Baghdadi militants killed the hostages four years ago
 lekin siyasat main uljhi sarkaar ne punjab chunaav tak saans roke rakhi, kyonki 39 main se 31 punjab ke the
 i told the truth that 39 Indians were killed
 The government has misled the 39 families who lost their relatives: Harjit Masih, man who returned from Mosul earlier, claimed that 39 Indians were killed by ISIS there

 This was Sushma's old statement
 On July 27 last year, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had raised a bitter opinion on why the missing Indians in Mosul are being told that they must have been killed
 unhone kaha tha ki jabatak mere paas unke maare jane ke saboot nahin milte, main unhen ded dikalair nahin karuungi
 i will not declare them dead
 bina saboot ke kisi ko kah dena ki wo mar gaya yah vyaktigat taur par paap he
 The MEA and particularly my colleagues @ sushmaswarajji and @ gen_vksinghji left no stone unturned in trying to trace and safely bring back those we lost in Mosul
 Our Government remains fully committed towards ensuring the safety of our sisters and brothers overseas
 - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 20, 2018 It took four years for the Indian government and Sushma Swaraj to get rid of this sin
 general wike singh ne is talash main jamkar iraq bhraman kiya, lekin is khoj ko lekar wo kitne gambhir the or ise iraqi sarkaar kitni tavajjo de rahi thi ise is tathy se samajha ja saktaa he ki 24 oktober 2017 ko jab wo baghdad pahunche to na to iraq ke pradhanmantri desh main maujuud the, na videsh mantri or na hi raksha mantri
 Delay due to evidence According to the government, the question in this delay was only of evidence
 lekin sushamaa swaraj ne is soobat kii siyasat main jis aadmi ko jhootha bataa daalaa he wo pehle din se kah rahaa he ki koi nahin bachaa hoga
 The question does not arise
 harjit messiah jaise-taise mosul se bhaag niklaa tha
 She is the only witness to the landmine terror of Baghdadi, but her testimony Sushma Swaraj has never found it reliable
 harjit messiah aaj bhi hindustan main rahete hai

 Who attacked Iqbal Kaskar, brother of Dawood Ibrahim, the eldest don of the underworld? Who is heating Mumbai? Who wants to see a bloody gang war on the streets of Mumbai once again? There may be only one target but Mumbai is at stake
 kya he is hamale ke peeche kii hakeekat? kyon todaa gaya gangvaar kaa usul? auki koun he jo karnaa chahta he mumbai ko garam?zaahir he aap jaananaa chaahate honge ki aakhir daaud ke ghar main ghus kar daaud ke bhai yani khud daaud par hamalaa karne kii jurrat kisne kii hogi? koun he wo jo sidhe daaud se do-do haath karnaa chahta he? to pehle di company ke dushmano kii list or mumbai police kii kahani par najar dauda lijie
 The night prayers in Nagpada area of south Mumbai had ended at 9:30 pm on Tuesday night
 daaud ibrahim kaa bhai iqbaal kaskar namaaz padhane ke baad apane ghar lautaa
 He was accompanied by six-seven henchmen including bodyguard Aif
 isi bich chaar ladke nagpada ke usee ilaake main ghuse jise di company kaa garh kaha jaataa he
 Two of them were riding motorcycles and two on foot
 paidal khadey donon ladakon ko motorcycle par savaar ladakon ne jaise hi ishaara diya, unamem se ek ne fouran jeb se revolver nikaala or sari kii sari golyaan ikbaal kaskar or uske gurgon kii taraf taan kar khaali kar di
 As Arif stood at the forefront, all the bullets penetrated him
 is bich ikbaal samet usek baaki gurgey ghar kii aad lekar chup chuke the
 As soon as the work was over, the two boys now ran out of the second revolver, firing bullets in the air
 magar ilaaka tang tha or bheed kaaphi zyada
 So after going some distance, the mob caught them both and then handed them over to the police
 jabaki afbia-tafari kaa phayda uthaa kar motor cycle parasavaar donon ladke pehle hi khisak chuke the
 Iqbal's bodyguard Arif was killed on the spot
 di-company ke saare dushmano ke naam saamne ek-ek kar saamne aane lage
 The first suspicion went to Don Satosh Shetty sitting in Bangkok
 jisaki company se puraani ranjish thi lekin indiaj mot wanted daaud kii dehshat kaa andaja lagaaie ki shetty kaa naam jaise hi is hamale se judaa usne news channelon ke phone ghum-ghuma kar khud hi safai dena shuru kar diya ki is hamale main shetty gang nahin he
 On the other hand, an emergency meeting of the Mumbai Crime Branch had started immediately after the attack
 police ne ghatana ke peeche chota rajan or uski saraparasati main chalane vaale kuch gang jinamein ravi pujari, hemanth pujari, ejaj lackdavaala or yahaan tak ki bablu shrivastav or ali bundesh par maathapai shuru kar di
 The police feared that in no time, a don in the same list of enemies of d Company would take responsibility for this incident and then it would not be late to start the gang war
 lekin jo anderworld apana kad badhaane ke liye jab-tab aisi ghatnaon kii bad-chadh kar jimmedaari letaa tha, usee anderworld kaa har don is vaardaat se mangalvaar ko batch nikalnaa chahta tha
 Every don was cleaning, he did not attack
 hamale ke peeche uskaa haath nahin he
 After all, it was about brother's brother
 anderworld ke wo tamaam don jo jab-tab di-company ko dhamkaate rahete hai, is hamale ke fouran baad yaa to khamosh ho gaye hai yaa phir apni safai dete phir rahe hai
 Just guess what is the meaning of this attack and what is its outcome or what is going to happen? The attack was done by entering Dawood's stronghold
 daaud ke ghar ke baahar daaud ke bhai par kiya gaya
 But the Mumbai Police says that the attack was not on Dawood's brother but on his brother's bodyguard
 zaahir he police kii ye baat hajam nahin hoti
 This is also the reason
 agar nishane par arrif hi tha to hamalavar aarif ke ghar jaakar yaa kahin bhi,kabhi bhi use maar sakate the
 They do not take such a big risk by entering Dawood's stronghold, but the police is helpless
 wo nahin chaahati ki maamla tool pakade kyonki phir mumbai kii sadako par gangvaar rokna namumkin hoga
 According to underworld sources, Chhota Rajan himself has denied involvement in the attack and says that d Company and Mumbai Police have also agreed that Chhota Rajan has nothing to do with the attack
 to phir hamalaa kisne kiya? ajtak ne sach tak pahunchane ke liye di company or uske dushmano ke saath-saath mumbai police ke kuch aalaa afasaron ko bhi kureda
 The things that came out after this are very shocking
 mumbai police ke sutron ke mutabik is hamale main us gang kaa haath ho saktaa he jo di company or chota rajan ko pachhad kar khud sabase bada don bananaa chahta he
 This gang has a significant influence in Nepal
 pakade gaye donon hamalaaron main se ek indralal bahadur khatri nepal kaa hi rahane vaala he or pehle maovadayon ke saath judaa rahaa tha
 Syed Bilal was also living in Nepal for a long time
 iske alaava mumbai police is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kar rahi he ki is hamale ke peeche daaud ko uske garh se baahar nikaalane or use dhamkaana bhi makasad ho saktaa he
 Dawood is not only scared after Osama's death, but it is reported that he has also changed his base in Pakistan
 vaise is hamale ko lekar ek theory or bhi he or wo ye ki khud police anderworld ke alag-alag dhadon ko aapas main ladava kar is gangvaar or anderworld ko hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye khatm kar dena chaahati he
 Here in Mumbai, Iqbal Kaskar is attacked, and after fifteen minutes, Dawood, who is hiding in Pakistan, gets the news, on the phone
 puraa di-company achaanak pareshaan ho jaataa he
 He wants to get the smallest details about the attack but Dawood, Anees and Chhota Shakeel themselves could not call Mumbai as the ISI did not want to
 idhar mambai ke nagpada main goliyaan chalin or udhar pakistan main phone kii ghanti ghanaghna uthi
 Bhai had already received information about the attack on his brother
 pakistan main baitha di company kaa har bada shaks khaas kar daaud kaa parivaar hamale kii choti se choti jaankaree phone par le rahaa tha
 Dawood and his brothers breathed in peace when it was found that Iqbal Kaskar was safe
 par is hamale ne daaud or uske bhaaiyon kii bebasii bhi dikhaai
 Helpless not to call
 khufia beuro ke sutron ke mutabik osama bin laden kii pakistan main maut ke baad pakistani khufia agency ieai ne daaud ibrahim, anis ibrahim ou chota shakeel par kai bandishen laga di hai
 So that his presence in Pakistan cannot be proved and one of these restrictions is ban on calling these three to India
 sutron ke mutabik iesai ne daaud, anis or chota shakeel ko hidaayat de rakhi he ki bharat main kisi ko bhi phone milaane se ek din pehle wo use khabar kare
 Please give a list of phone numbers on which to call them
 iesai kii hari jhandi ke baad hi phir wo phone mila sakate hai
 Not only this, the ISI has ordered all the phone, fax and internet connections to be cut from the rooms of these three before going to sleep at night
 sutron ke mutabik mangalvaar kii raat bhai par hamale kii khabar milte hi daaud or anis ne pehle iesai ko isaki khabar di or phir manjuuri milane ke baad der raat hi mumbai main phone milaayaa
 Otherwise, he just kept waiting for the phone coming from Mumbai, and in the meantime, he reached the d Company through the phone
 daaud ke bhai anis ibrahim ne ajtak se kaha ki bhai par hamale kaa jawaab ap company degi
 The foundation of the d-company was laid on hundreds of corpses
 anderworld main di company kaa khauf banane main saikadon logon kaa khun bahaya gaya
 Dawood walked the heap of corpses and established his fear
 assi kaa dashak gavaah he daaud ibrahim kaskar ke gangvaar se kaanpati mubani kaa
 The d company, which was laid the foundation stone of Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail, is today valued at Rs 3000 crore
 kuch log to isaki maaliyat 90 hajaar karod bhi bataate hai
 Dawood has reached this mountain of wealth through a pile of corpses
 haji mastaan ke liye smagaling karne vaala ek police hawaldaar kaa betaa daaud ibrahim fitrat se apradhi tha
 Money was his compulsion and weakness
 mumbai police kii file se nikali ghatnaon ke mutabik haji mastaan ke liye kaam karte hue daaud ibrahim ne 1977 main pehali baar dariyaa main ek naav luti
 At today's price, it was worth Rs 1 crore 26 lakh
 paise kii garmi main garmaae daaud ibrahim ne apane guru haji mastaan ko peeche chhodte hue pair aage badaye to uske saamne khadaa tha mumbai kaa pathan gangdaood ibrahim ne di company ko mumbai kaa king banane ke liye sabase pehle apane aade aa rahi kareeb lala kii company ko ukhaadne kii thaanee
 Karim Lala's nephews Alamzeb and Alam Geer run it
 samjhaute ke baavjood daaud ne in donon ko khatm kar diya
 The survivors of Karim Lala's Pathan gang murdered Dawood Ibrahim's brother Shabbir on the moving road to avenge the killing of Alamzeb and Alamgir, and Dawood Ibrahim then committed the killings
 1981 main bhai shabbir kii hatya kaa badla lene ke liye daaud ibrahim ne 2 maheene main 18 katl kar karimlala or usase jude logon ko ek dam saaf kar diya
 After this, Dawood Ibrahim said in his interview to India Today that we were modest traders, the murder of our brother criminalized us
 par in hatyaon ne daaud ko dabadabaa mumbai main kaayam kar diya or ab daaud or uski company kaa sikaa chalane laga
 Dawood's enemies placed their bets on David's brother-in-law
 bahan hasina parkar ke pati ibrahim parkar ko gavali giroh ne goli maar di
 David goes mad with anger
 1992 main daaud ne jeje aspataal main bhartee gavali ke aadmi shailesh haldankar kii police hiraasat ke bich hatya karvaa di
 After this, there was an unwritten agreement between all the gangs in Mumbai that no one would attack anyone's family
 aise main jab daaud ke bhai par hamalaa hua to mumbai police ke hosh ud gaye hai
 After the 1992 bombings in Mumbai, the underworld was divided on communal grounds
 On one side, Dawood Ibrahim's d Company, ISI, IM, lashkar-e-taiba and Al Qaeda were standing, on the other hand Chhota Rajan, Bharat Nepali, Bablu Srivastava, Ejaz Lakdawala, Vicky Malhotra, Santosh Shetty, Ali Bangash, Bunty Pandey, Ravi Pujari Wagaira stood
 ab daaud duniya kaa behad khaufnak aatankwaadi ban chukaa he
 His network is used in terrorist attacks against India, but the fear of his name still prevails in Mumbai, Chhota Rajan is the strongest among his enemies and he is looking for help from Dawood anti-government intelligence agencies
 par daaud ke ghar main ghus kar hui is taaja vaardaat ne jarur ye suraag diya he ki daaud ko maat dene kii koshishen shaayad phir majboot ho rahi hai
 In Meerut, an incident has come out which has severed the dignity of the relationship
 do bhaaiyon ne apni karatuut se bhai-bahan ke pavitra rishte par hi kaalikh pot di
 It is alleged that the two brothers raped their 15-year-old sister for the past several years
 meeratmen peedit ladki ne apane do sage bhaaiyon parrepakarne kaa sansanikhej aarope lagaakar sabko hairaan kar diya he
 The 12th-grade sister alleges that for the last four years, her two brothers have been interacting with her and threaten to make the matter public
 peedita ne chaalaaki se kisi tarah aaropee bhaaiyon kii karatuut mobile main kaid kar lee or madad ke liye ek enjio ke paas pahunchi jahaan usepulicetak pahunchaaya gaya
 After this, the police have arrested the accused brothers
 meerut ke civil lines main rahane vaali is ladki ne jab apni aapbeetee enjio or police ko bataai to sab hairaan rah gaye
 The girl told that her two immediate brothers have been robbing her of her hope for 4 years
 philhalaladkiki shikaayat par police ne aaropee bhaaiyon ko pakad liya he or ladki kaa medical pareekshan karke maamle kii tafteesh main jute gai he
 Police say that both the brothers have confessed to their crime during interrogation
 meerut ke espi city ranvijay singh ne bataaya ki maamle main exiaar darj kar lee gai he
 Based on the evidence, both the brothers have been arrested
 unhone bataaya ki poochtacha ke dauraan donon ne apana jurm sweekaar kar liya he
 Further action will be taken by taking both the accused brothers in custody
 jammu evam kashmir main buudhvaar ko niyantran rekha par bharat ke mig-21 vimaan ne pakistan ke epa-16 ko maar giraaya, jisaki saraahna puure desh main ho rahi he
 But experts say that even though the IAF aircraft was old, the new version of the Bison is undoubtedly not old
 pakistan vayusena va bhartiya vayusena ke ladaaku vimaanon ke bich ladaai hui, jisamen yah ubharkar aayaa ki wing commander abhinandan ne apane mig-21 se ghuspaith karne vaale vimaan ko giraane main kaamyaab rahe
 Although Pakistan denied the involvement of the F-16 aircraft in the attack, India said there was evidence of it
 mig-21 va epa-16 alag-alag pidiyon ke hai
 The PAF flew a new version of the us-made fighter aircraft F-16C / D, while the mig-21 Bison is the advanced incarnation of an aircraft serving for 60 years
 bharat main mig-21 ke bare main janata kii dharna utsaah janak nahin he, kyonki vimaan ke lagaataar durghatnagrast hone se ise 'flying coffin' kaa naam mil gaya he, jiskaa haal main pakistan ke saath tanaavpurn maahaul main puraane ladaaku vimaan ko lekar sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai
 Experts say that the F-16 is much better at aiming, but the mig-21 has its own specialty
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki mig-21 saaf taur par bhartiya vayusena kii pasand he, aisa isliye kyonki iske gasht ke liye tatparta kii vajah se kisi bhi apaat sthiti main har samay istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 According to experts, the mig-21 is the most preferred aircraft for this role, as they take the least time to travel by air as compared to all other fighter aircraft
 mig-21 keval do minute main launch kiya ja saktaa he
 The mig-21 Bison can carry a range of weapons like any other modern fighter aircraft and has very good features
 isamen aar 073 kii ladaaku missile he, jisaki range 20-25 kimi he or vijual range kii missile se pare fire kar saktaa he
