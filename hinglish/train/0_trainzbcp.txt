 Instead he returned with a story of the accident
 dastavejon main kaha gaya he ki 18 agast, 1945 kii subah japani vayusena ke ek bamvashark vimaan ne vietnam ke turan se bose or 12-13 anya yatriyon tathaa chaalak dal ke sadasyon ke saath udaan bhari
 In the aircraft, the Japanese Army Lieutenant General T
 shidei bhi savaar the
 The route of the aircraft was heto-taipe-darren-tokyo
 teen-sadasyeey netaji jaanch samiti kaa gathan bharat sarkaar ne 1956 main kiya tha or iske adhyaksh netaji kii aaazaad hind fouj ke major general shah navaj khan the
 The committee was told that since the weather was fine and the engines were functioning smoothly, the pilot decided to go over Heto and directly to Taipei, where it would be reached by morning or afternoon
 japani air staff officer or yatriyon main shaamil major taaro cono ne samiti ko bataaya, maine paaya ki baayin ore ke ingine thik se kaam nahin kar rahe the
 So i went inside the aircraft and after checking the engine inside i found that it worked properly
 unhone bataaya ki saath main maujuud enjinier ne bhi ingine kii jaanch kii
 Engineer Capt
 Nakamura alias Yamamoto, in charge of maintenance at the airport, agreed with Major Kono that there was a problem with the engine on the left
 yamamamoto ne kaha ki payalat ne unase kaha ki yah ek nayaa ingine he
 He said that after slowing the engine speed, the pilot adjusted it for about five minutes
 ingine ko major takijava (payalat) ne do baar jaancha
 After adjusting i satisfied myself that the engine condition was fine
 major takijava ne is baat se bhi mere saath sahmati jataai ki ingine main kuch gadabadi nahin he
 However, according to Bose's ADC and a co-passenger, Colonel Habib ur Rehman, a massive explosion occurred shortly after
 jameen par se dekh rahe naakaamura ne kaha, udaan bharne ke thik baad vimaan apni bain ore jhuk gaya or maine vimaan se kuch girte dekha, baad main maine paaya ki vah propeller tha
 He also said that the aircraft had reached a height of 30 to 40 meters
 unhone anumaan lagaaya ki kancreet kii hawaipattee se kareeb 100 meter kii duuri par vimaan durghatana hua or turant hi iske agle hisse main aag lag gai
 Colonel Rahman said, Netaji turned towards me
 maine kaha, aage se nikliye, peeche se rasta nahin he
 "we could not get out of the entrance, as it was closed with packages and other things," he said
 isliye netaji aage se baahar nikle, darasal vah aag se hokar daude
 i was following them in the same flames of fire
 unhone bataaya, jab main baahar niklaa to maine unhen apane se 10 yard aage, khadey, vipareet disha se mujhe dekhte hue dekha
 i ran and i had a hard time unbuttoning his bush shirt belt
 unki patalun main zyada aag nahin lagi thi or use nikaalnaa jaruri nahin tha
 Rehman was wearing uni clothes, while Bose was wearing cotton khaki, which easily caught fire
 rahamaan ne bataaya, maine unhen jameen par litayaa or paaya ki unke sir par katane kaa ek gaharaa nishaan he, shaayad yah baayin ore tha
 His face was scorched and his hair was also burnt by fire
 unhone bataaya, netaji ne mujhase hindustani main kaha- aapako jyaad to nahin lagi? maine jawaab diya ki mujhe lagata he ki main sahi salaamat hum
 About himself he said that he feels he will not survive
 tippaniyan Bose said, "when you go back to your country, tell the brothers of the country that i will continue to fight for the independence of the country till the end, they should continue the war
" hindustan jarur aaazaad hoga, use koi gulam nahin rakh saktaa
 Lieutenant Shiro Nonogaki present in the aircraft said, "when i first saw Netaji after the plane crash, he was standing somewhere near the edge of the left wing of the plane
" unke kapadon main aag lagi hui thi or unke sahaayak (karnal rahamaan) unka kot utaarne kii koshish kar rahe the
 However there is discrepancy in the details provided by Rahman, Nonogaki, Kono, Takahashi and Nakamura
 unhone durghatana ke 11 saal baad sakshya die
 The website said that but his statements had no opinion about the fact of the accident and the resulting severe burns of Bose
 netaji ko paas ko gambhir haalat main nanmon military aspataal le jaaya gaya
 In September 1945, British officials based in India sent intelligence teams to identify Bose and arrest him if possible
 iske bajaay ve durghatana kii kahani ke saath laute
 The three-member Netaji Investigation Committee was set up by the Government of India in 1956 and its chairman was Major General Shah Nawaz Khan of the Azad Hind Fauj of Netaji

 Japanese air staff officer and passenger Major Taro Kono told the committee, i found that the engines on the left were not working properly

 He told, Netaji told me in Hindustani - You did not like much? i replied that i think i am safe

 aise main unki misbah se tulana galat he
 Younis, who played 101 Tests for Pakistan, also said that he is ready to take the captaincy of the Test team again
 younus ne kaha, 'sanyas lene se pehle agar mujhe dobaaraa test team kii captaini karne kaa mauqaa mili to main kushi se sweekaar karugaan

 Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavati is not taking the name of the problems being reduced
 karani sena or rajput sanghathan lagaataar bain karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 The dispute has now reached the Supreme Court after coming out of the corridors of politics

 The Election Commission's refusal to ban Padmavati, BJP had demanded, according to the demand petition, that the trailer showed Rani Padmavati doing a ghoomar dance, but the queens of the royal house did not boast
 yahaan tak ki unki skin bhi nahin dikhti thi jaisaa ki trailor main deepika ko dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 This form of Padmavati is hurting the feelings of Rajput community
 petishan dekar maang kii ja rahi he ki pehle itihaas main rani ke bare main puri jaankaree hasil kar lene ke baad hi ise relies hone diya jaae
 On the other hand, people of Kshatriya community in Vikasnagar of Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow burnt an effigy of the film's director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and actress Deepika Padukone while opposing the film 'padmavati'

 He made it clear through a video that there are no dream sequences between Rani Padmini and Khilji in the film

 Bhansali's trouble has increased in Rajasthan
 vahaan koi distributor film dikhaane ko raji nahin he
 Everyone has refused to buy the rights to the film
 film ke virodh main jaipur ke purv rajpariwaar ne bhi morcha khol diya he
 Former royal house princess and MLA Dia Kumari has expressed her anger
 unhone kaha ki film ke bahaane rajasthan ke itihaas se chhedchhad bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, Karni Sena is already under siege of the film

 Due to the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), many leaders of the Asom Gana Parishad protested with the top leadership of the party
 party netaaon main anban kii khabaren saamne aa rahi thim
 It is believed that the top leadership of the party has decided to withdraw support due to these protests
 naagarikta kanoon kaa congress samet kai vipakshi dalon ne jamkar virodh pradarshan kiya he
 Cases of violent clashes are coming up against the citizenship law
 gauratlab he isse pehleol india majalis-e-ittehadul musalamin (eimm)pramukh saansad asaduddin ovaisi ne siee ko supreme court main chunauti di thi
 He also spoke of the nexus between CAA and NRC
 ovaisi kaa kahana he ki enarasi kaa uddeshy bharat main rahane vaale avaidh pravaasiyon kii pahchaan karnaa he
 Owaisi urged the apex court to veil the CAA-NRC nexus, which under Article-21 of the constitution can become a hindrance to the right to life and personal liberty of every person

 He wrote on Twitter that the platform (twitter) believes that the reach of the political message should be 'earned' and not 'bought'
 a political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet
 Paying for reaching removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people
 We believe this decision should not be compromised by money

 The Congress has taken an aggressive stance on the BJP over the controversy over the trailer of Bollywood actor Anupam Kher's film The Accidental Prime Minister
 maharashtra youth congress adhyaksh sathyajith tambe ne kaha he ki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bijepi kaa yah propaganda he
 The BJP is officially promoting the film on social media
 unhone aage kaha ki saaf he ki teen rajyon main mili haar or kisaanon ke mudde se dhyaan hataane ke liye bijepi yah kar rahi he
 Let me tell you that the trailer of the film is making a splash in the streets of social media at this time
 is film main anupam kher, desh ke purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke kirdaar main hai
 The film is based on the book of his media advisor Sanjay Baru
 lekin jab se film kaa trailor aayaa he tabhi ye raajnneetik bahes kaa mudda bhi ban gai he
 The trailer of the Bharatiya Janata party-congress film is face to face on the scene shown in it
 bijepi netaa roopa ganguli ne kaha he ki film or kitaab main roak nahin lagaana chahie
 Nehru had banned many books
 roak lagaana thik nahin hota he
 Whether it is a film or a book, the country is known for its Freedom of Speech
 freedom of spich ko kabhi ruknaa nahin chahie
 Rupa Ganguly said that the film is a film, how much truth is there in it, it is written on the trust of the book
 agar congress ko pasand nahin aa rahi he film to vah nahin dekhen
 'sharad Pawar should have become Prime Minister', Union Minister Ramdas Athawale said that Manmohan Singh ji is a good man
 vah rigerv bank ke governor bhi rahe hai
 He was also an economist
 anbhavi aadmi the, lekin raajnneetik anubhav unako nahin tha
 Sonia Gandhi was required to become Prime Minister
 tab main upie ke saath tha
 i met Sonia Gandhi and said that you became the Prime Minister
 par sonia gandhi pradhanmantri banane ke liye taiyaar nahin huin
 Therefore, if Sonia Gandhi did not become Prime Minister, Sharad Pawar should have been made Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki us samay sharad pavaar congress party ke liye bahut hi jimmedaar vyakti the
 He did not make Sharad Pawar the Prime Minister, so he made Manmohan Singh the Prime Minister as a senior leader
 It was an accident
 isse pehle congress ne apane sabhi pravaktaaon or netaaon ko circular jari kiya
 He should avoid speaking on the issue of this film
 kendriya mantri rajyavardhan singh rathore kaa kahana he ki aakhir congress kis prakaar film kii aazaadee par sawaal uthaa sakati he
 So the other minister Hardeep Puri said that he will definitely see this film
 bhartiya janata party ke iti cell pramukh amit malviya ne bhi congress par hamalaa bolaa
 He wrote why Congress wants to censor a film which is based on a book
 or kitaab bhi 2014 main chap chuki he
 Is it just because very few people read the book and more people watch the film
 Why does Congress want to censor a film when the book it is based on was published way back in April 2014? Just because fewer people read books than watch a movie?where are the champions of free speech and expression? Stand up for artistic freedom! # theaccidentalprimeministerpic

 juaan marta (88wein minute) ne team kii ore se chauthaa gol daaga
 Torres, who scored a decisive goal against Germany in Euro 2008, also became the first player to score a goal in the finals of two European Championships during this time
 euro toornament ke itihaas main khitaabi jeet ke dauraan yah jeet kaa sabase bada antar he
 Earlier in 1972, West Germany defeated the Soviet Union 3–0

 His header on the cross of Abbate went off the goal while minutes later he managed to hit the Spanish defense again, but this time his attempt was thwarted by Casillas
 duusari taraf buphone ne febregas ke prayaas ko naakaam kiya
 The Italian team was lucky during this time when the referee could not see it despite Sergio Ramos's header being taken by Leonardo Benucci and he did not give a penalty kick
 italy kii vaapasi kii ummid us samay samaapt ho gai jab match khatm hone se lagbhag aadha ghanta pehle motaa ko pair kii mansapeshiyon main khinchaav ke kaaran strachar par baahar le janaa padaa or prendeli kii team ko baaki match 10 khilaadiyon ke saath khelnaa padaa

 yahaan isaki lokapriyata main itani raftaar se ijapha hua he ki duniya main sabase zyada fasebuk yugers aaj bharat main hai
 On the other hand, since the coming of the Modi government at the Center in 2014, the systems have also been digitized
 lekin online suraksha ke naam par desh main aaj bhi vahi kanoon he, jo 18 saal pehle bana tha
 Today, about 250 million people use Facebook in India, called the country of snake charmers
 2016 kii ek report ke mutabik, desh ke 36 karod se zyada log internet yuj karne lage hai
 That is, 28 people in every 100 people have access to the Internet
 iti mantri ravishankar prasad ke mutabik maujuuda vakt main desh kii 120 karod janata ke aadhaar card hai
 Even further, the Indian economy is going digital
 8 november 2016 ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab desh main chal rahe 500 or 1000 ke note par bain lagaaya to sarkaar ne deshavaasiyon se online banking, digital banking, mobile banking par aane kaa aahvaan kiya
 Government decrees and lack of cash forced people to become cashless
 magar, haal main jab fasebuk ke jariye logon kii nijee jaankaree li hone kaa khulaasa hua to puure desh main hangaamaa much gaya
 Cambridge Analytica, a foreign company, was accused of influencing elections in India by taking data from Facebook
 iske baad desh ke donon mukhya dal sattadhari bijepi or vipakshi congress ke bich janata kaa data export karne ke aarope-pratyarope hone lage
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi is alleging that the public data was sent to the US through the Narendra Modi app, while the BJP retorted that the Congress is sending personal information of people from its app to Singapore
 kareeb ek hafte se chal rahe is episod ke bich ab tak is khulaase main karrwai ke naam parcambridge analitica ko noticebheja gaya he
 The government has sought a response from Cambridge Analytica by 31 March on whether it was involved in misusing the data of Indians and influencing the way they voted
 notice main company se yah bhi poocha gaya he ki kin ikaayiyon ne uski sevaayen lee hai, vah kis tareeke se aankade rakhti he or kya yugers kii sahmati leti he
 On the other hand, Facebook has been warned only for this crime
 fasebuk se kaha gaya he ki agar usne aankadon kii chori ke jariye chunaavon ko prabhavit karne kaa prayaas kiya to uske khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 Now come to the law
 maujuuda vakt main desh ke paas iti act ke rup main ek kanoon he, jo is tareeke ke maamalon main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In India moving towards Digital India, this law was brought in the year 2000, after which it was amended in 2008
 samay-samay par visheshgyon ne is baat par jor diya ki yah kanoon maujuuda paristhiti ke lihaaj ke naakaafi he or khaskar data chori ke sambandh main or bhi kamjor
 In such a situation, the Ministry of Information Technology took a step forward in this direction by introducing 'data Protection Act'
 iske liye 31 july 2017 ko mantralay ne justise bean krishna kii adhyakshata main visheshgyon kii ek cameti kaa gathan kiya
 Apart from Justice Krishna, the committee has 9 more members, including legal information including cyber experts, engineers and officials of ministries
 is cameti kii jimmedaari data chori se judi samasyaon kaa pataa lagaakar unhen dur kaise kiya jaae, is par kaam karnaa he
 After working on all aspects, the committee will draft the 'data Protection Bill', on the basis of which the law will be brought
 haalanki, yah kab tak ho paaegaa ise lekar abhi spasht jaankaree nahin he
 In a special conversation with India Today, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that at present, the government has an IT Act and to address this problem, the government is going to bring a better data protection law
 yani abhi kanoon aayega
 In such a big question, the Congress, which is the oldest party in the country, takes the credit of bringing a computer revolution in the country and the BJP, which claims to be the largest party in the world in terms of activists, is still no big for making digital India safe

 Baghdadi and its empire can end anytime
 lihaaja bache-khuche log abhi se bagdadi kaa vaaris yaa yun kahen ki bagdadi kaa uttaradhikari chunane main lag gaye hai
 That is, ISIS is now looking for a new caliph in place of Baghdadi
 is talash kii vajah bani he mosul kii wo ladaai, jahaan har guzarate din ke saath bagdadi ke aatanki kam hote ja rahe hai
 ISIS is being heavily engulfed in different areas of the Iraqi city of Mosul
 ek-ek kar uske tamaam kile zameendos ho rahe hai
 ISIS is declining
 iesas ke hausale post pad chuke hai
 The hour of the elimination of ISIS is almost over now
 kisi bhi vakt duniya ke nakshe se is sabase kaufanaak aatankwaadi sanghathan kaa naamo-nishaan mit saktaa he
 Iraq has already uprooted its foot from almost all small and big places
 ab yahaan mosul hi wo iklauti jagah bachi he, jahaan uske saath kurdish peshmarga fiters or iraqi fuj ke bich aamane-saamne kii ladaai chal rahi he
 The good news is that his condition has become thin here too, but before we show you a complete picture of this battle going on in Mosul
 esees ke ek sniper kii kahani sunaate hai
 Although there are so many snipers in this battle, constantly choosing their enemies continuously, but there are some of these sharp shooters who have completed centuries to kill ISIS terrorists
 mosul main haal ke dinon main iesas ne us base par bhi kabza jamaa liya tha, jiskaa istemaal kabhi iraqi taanashaah saddaam hossain karata tha
 After besieging the base, the ISIS commander was holed up in a sniper from the SAS with just one bullet
 is shooter kaa ye nishaanaa itnaa sateek tha ki goli is commander ke sir main bilkul bichon-bich lagi
 Although these snipers also maintain records of their scars, but after reaching Iraq, he killed so many terrorists that his speed was also disturbed
 iesas ke saath iraqi fuj kii chhitput ladaai to pehle se jari thi
 But jung-e-mosul was formally announced on 16 October
 makasad tha iraqi shahar mosul se iesas ko khaded bhagaanaa
 Operation In two weeks more than 120 villages and towns were evacuated from ISI
 1 november ko iraqi fuj mosul main daakhil ho gai
 After the death of hundreds of terrorists, now any time Iraqi army can win here
 aise main ab bas itnaa samaj lijie ki iesas kii shikast or iraqi fuj kii jeet ke bich sirf ek qadam kaa faaslaa he
 For the last three years, Baghdadi made Iraq and Syria cry tears of blood
 hajaaron logon ko maut ke ghat utaara
 Made millions of families destitute
 ghar-ghar ko matam diya
 Now the same day has returned for Baghdadi and his own terrorists
 ab wo khud khun ke aansu ro rahe hai
 Regretting the fate pichley kuch dinon se phir ye khabar zoron par he ki bagdadi jang main maaraa ja chukaa he
 His terrorists have now become truly orphaned
 dehshat kii duniya main meeting kaa daur jari he
 The children of terror are in a dilemma
 khabar baahar jane na paae ki ham yateem ho gaye
 There is a panic in the room
 aatankka khalipha frem main tasviir banakar lataka he
 After all, what is the matter? bahut andar se ye khabar ai he ki iesas ke khalipha kii ruh jahannam ko paravaaz kar chuki he
 Like wildfire, it is common news in Iraq and Syria that Baghdadi's ISIS is now looking for another Baghdadi
 isse pehle ki aatankiyon khud ko yateem samajhen unke upar aatank kii nae sarparast kii tajposhi kii jane kii taiyaari he
 It is reported from a very serious Jerusalem Post that Baghdadi has been killed in Mosul
 iesasake senior aatanki uske uttaradhikari ke liye iraq main kisi anjaan jagah par immergency meeting kar rahe hai

 In the year 2018, he made his film debut opposite Ishaan Khattar in the film Dhadak
 film main unke abhinay kii prashansa kii gai
 She will now be seen in Karan Johar's film Takht
 is hafte release hui 'kya dilli kya lahore', jisamen mukhya bhoomika main hai vijay raaj, manu rishi, vishwajit pradhan or raaj jutshi
 
 
 The story of the film decreases after the independence of India and the partition of the country, where only one of the soldiers on both sides fighting on the border of hindustan-pakistan remains, and then hunger and thirst leave them with the language of gun humanity
 The language of the person makes him speak
 
 
 'kya dilli kya lahore' kaa nirmaan kiya he karan aroda ne, nirdeshak hai khud vijay raaj, or film ke prastota hai diggaj lekhak−geetkaar gulzaar
 
 
 The film talks about the political movement of the two countries and the relationship that cannot be erased
 
 
 puri film kareeb-kareeb ek hi ilaake main shoot hui he
 
 
 Almost two characters appear in almost the entire film, but despite this the film does not lose its pace anywhere, nor does the film seem to lack characters
 
 
 sabase badi baat yah he ki film bina koi gyaan die hansaate hue badi aasaani se apni baat kah jaati he
 
 
 If you are fond of watching serious and meaningful cinema, then the tight script and screenplay of this film will not give you a chance to move
 
 
 'kya dilli kya lahore' ke kai dialog aapako gudgudaayenge or aap par gaharaa asar chhod jaaenge
 
 
 The beauty of the film is its simplicity, Vijay Raaz's superb acting and direction
 
 
 manu rishi kaa kaam bhi acha he, lekin kahin-kahin dialog bolne kaa jo tarika unhone pakadaa he, vah kuch khalataa he
 
 
 The roles of Raj Zutshi and Vishwajit Pradhan are minor, but both have done well
 
 
 film kaa sangeet or becoground score kahani main apana yogadan bakhubi karte hai
 
 
 Some technical specifics needed further attention
 
 
 masalan, kuch seens main becoground music kii kami or thodaa edit kaa masala, lekin shaayad darshakon ko yah na khale
 
 
 Overall 'kya Delhi Kya Lahore' will reach your heart while entertaining you
 
 
 is film ke liye meri reating he - 4 star

 In response, Govinda said that politics is difficult work

 iske baad bhi gussai bheed ne jamkar hangaamaa kiya tha

 The Haryana election results have brought the BJP in 'alert mode' in Jharkhand
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main mukhya vipakshi dal jharkhand vikaas morch (jhavimo) ke chah vidhayakon ko todakar kisi tarah sarkaar banane main safal rahi bhaajapa is baar kisi bhi haal main bahumat ke aankade ko choona chaahati he
 The BJP has kept Om Mathur, the national vice-president and the state assembly election in-charge, since August
 jharkhand main is saal hue loksabhaa chunaav main bhale hi 14 main se 12 siten rajg ko milin, magar party vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar kisi tarah ke mugalate main nahin he
 The party believes that even after sweeping all the 10 Lok Sabha seats of Haryana, when it could not get a majority in the assembly elections, then it is not right to be 'over confident' about Jharkhand
 bhaajapa main chunaav prabandhan se jude ek netaa ne kaha, "bhaajapa is maamle main khushnaseeb he ki use koi na koi chunaav nateeja aage ke liye, samay rahete red alert kar detaa he, jisase aage kii ranneetik chukon ko dur karne main madad milti he
 Looking at the Haryana election results, the party is working on a 'fullproof plan'
 ise dharaatal par utaarne ke liye sanghathan ke aise manze hue netaaon kii team utaari jaaegi, jinhen jharkhand ke mizaaj kii baarik samaj hogi
 'actually, bjp's concern about Jharkhand is because last time only 37 out of 81 seats were won
 tab bahumat ke liye bhaajapa ko mukhya vipakshi dal jhavimo ke chah vidhayakon ko todna padaa tha
 After this, BJP had 43 mlas as against 41 required for majority
 rajyapal ne do tihaai se adhik vidhayakon ke bhaajapa main aane ke kaaran unke vilay ko manjuuri di thi
 Party sources say that if like 2014 the bjp's car again stands away from the majority then it will be forced to do manipulative politics like last time, in such a situation the party will try to bring a majority by throwing full force in this time assembly elections

 During this, Shivraj said that he would support the Congress wholeheartedly for the people of MP but if he did not work, he would also protest
 aapako bataa den ki shivaraj singh chouhan ne satta jane ke baad haal hi main siem house ko khaali kar diya he
 Shivraj, sitting in his bungalow in 74 bungalows, spoke openly about the Lok Sabha elections from the lack of urea in Madhya Pradesh
 shivaraj se baatcheet ke ansh
 
 
 Question: You vacated CM House after 13 years
 ab usase kahin zyada chote ghar main rah rahe hai
 Do not feel despair? Shivraj: No, the ground sky is no difference, even if the house is small, the heart is very big and even if this heart beats, it beats for the 7:30 crore people of Madhya Pradesh
 yah ghar bhi ab janata kaa ghar he or janata yahaan he to yahaan rahakar hi janata kii seva karenge
 Great little is done by thinking, it is with thought, not from home
 janata ke ghar main janata kii seva karuunga
 Question: Do you rarely stay at home? Reached among the public again
 shivaraj: janata meri jindagi he main jeeta hum uske liye or uske bina main rah nahin saktaa
 If Chief Minister, he used to serve him with the power of a pen
 aaj chaukeedaar kii bhoomika main hum to jahaan ksht or dikkat dekhuunga vahaan baat karuunga or baat karke agar samaadhaan nahin hua to lard-ladke samaadhaan karuunga
 But i will live with my people and live for the public
 sawaal: chaukeedaar shabd baar-baar bol rahe hai, kya netaa pratipaksh to nahin ban rahe aap?shivaraj: maine kabhi bhi kisi daayitv ke bare main vichaar nahin kiya he jo kuch bhi tay kiya party ne kiya or vaise bhi netaa to main hum hi janata ke liye, janata ke saath or janata mere saath
 Question: What will the Congress cabinet say on this, it is not being decided? Shivraj: The sad part is that the work that should have been done earlier was to expand the cabinet, to form a systematic government, after doing that work and then the rest of the activities Starts
 ab tak hairaani he ki mantrimandal kaa gathan nahin ho sakaa he
 But before that, the people of the Bharatiya Janata Party selectively remove those who are sitting
 mujhe aapatti nahin he hamaare to zyaadaatar logon ne istipha de hi diya tha or duusari cheez jo mujhe ksht de rahi he, aaj maine kamalnath ji se baat kii he
 Accusing him of political rancor, he said that Congress leaders are taking revenge by electing
 police se cese banavaa rahe hai, pathar bikwa rahe hai
 Causing fights
 loktantr main haar jeet hoti rahati he
 Victory does not mean that you harass the workers of the opposition party, send them to jail, make a case against them
 agar yah praathamikta is sarkaar kii he to mujhe kuch nahin kahana
 The priority of the force should be that the Cabinet should carry out the work systematically
 sawaal: pradesh main uria kaa sankat he? kya vajah he isaki?shivaraj: main bhi mukhyamantri tha, main chaar-chaar din dilli baithta tha
 Before that we used to prepare, how much urea is required, but today nobody's attention is on this side
 aaj maine khabar padhi jisamen centre sarkaar par aarope lagaae gaye
 Hey, you have a miss management, don't take care of yourself, you are not worrying about the farmer and you are blaming others
 yah kaha ja rahaa he ki punjab uria bhej diya, rajasthan bhej diya
 Whose government is there punjab main congress kii sarkaar he
 There is a Congress government in Rajasthan
 bebuniyaad keechad oochhaalane kii koshish ho rahi he
 Nobody is worried about the farmers
 miss management ke kaaran kisaan behaal he, pareshaan he or keval centre sarkaar ko doshi bataa do
 Blame them, Congress, such things are being done by Congress, it is not right
 unako mantrimandal turant gathit karnaa chahie
 Organize the work
 sarkaar thik chalaaen or janata kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karen
 Question: Is the assembly session on the 7th, will the BJP be aggressive? Shivraj: First thing is that i am emotionally connected with the people of Madhya Pradesh and BJP wants welfare of the people of Madhya Pradesh and development of Madhya Pradesh, therefore our work is not this It is only abusive
 kadam-kadam par keval virodh karen, main phir doharaa rahaa hum, pradesh ke mukhya mantri kamalnath ji ko bhi maine yah kaha he ki pradesh kaa vikaas baadhit naa ho
 Even though the government has come second but there is continuity in development, for this we will cooperate in every way
 sakaaratmak sahyog karenge
 But if the public's work is not done, the promises are not fulfilled, then we will also protest fiercely
 lekin pradesh kaa vikaas baadhit naa ho iske liye sarkaar ko sahyog bhi karenge
 Question: Kamal Nath has also expressed that he will take along
 sushasan diwas bhi manaa rahe hai
 Shivraj: i congratulate him for that, Kamal Nath
 jo acha kaam karenge main dil se, hriday se badhai duungaa
 i will not oppose only to protest, they have established a good tradition
 atal ji ke naam par sushasan diwas kyonki sushasan ke pratik the atal ji
 We started, they continued, thank them
 sawaal: siem house main itane tyohaar manaae, kaarykram kiye
 Will the public ever see Shivraj in that form again? Shivraj: i made the House of the People a symbol of Sarvadharma Sambhav and CM House
 main jahaan rahoonga vahaan bhi chota ghar he
 Programs will be smaller there
 ham yahaan sab tyohaar manaayenge, janmashtami bhi hogi, ramanavami bhi hogi, shivaratri bhi hogi, holi bhi hogi, rojaa iftaar bhi hoga, prakashotsav bhi hoga, kshamaa vaani bhi hogi, christmas bhi hoga
 Because it is in the soil of India and the roots of India
 sarvadharm sadbhaav or main bharat kii samskruti kaa pratinidhi hum
 Question: 13 years CM, now you say 'tiger is alive' why? Shivraj: Wherever i used to go, people used to cry, people come here to meet, they still regret it
 ankhon main aansu ke saath aate hai, phir chintaa prakat karte hai ki ab ham kya karen, kiske paas jaaen, kai baar aisi ghatnaayen saamne aati hai ki jhuthe mukademe banaae ja rahe hai, pratadit kiya ja rahaa he, phir mere andar bhi anyaay ke khilaaf ladaai kaa bhav he, kyonki anyaay karne se bada paap anyaay sahanaa he
 i will not bear it, for my activists and for my people, i will fight it out firmly and so it came out of my mouth that don't worry Tiger is still alive
 sawaal: tiger kii dahaad vidhansabha main sunai degi?shivaraj: tiger to ek pratik shabd ho gaya, bhav yah he ki ham anyaay sahan nahin karenge or naa hi anyaay hone denge
 If it happens, we will fight, it will be a good thing, we will thank and if there is a mess, we will fight
 sawaal: vidisha loksabhaa seat se sushamaa swaraj ne ladane se manaa kar diya he kya shivaraj chunaav ladenge, centre main jaaenge?shivaraj: sushamaa didi aisi netaa hai jinka sara desh sammaan karata he
 God is pleased with them, they are healthy, we are among them, i urged them a lot but the final decision will be taken by the party
 hamaare yahaan sushamaa ji bhi faisla nahin kar saktin unke bare main, kyonki yah to party tay karegi
 Due to health reasons, it is no longer possible for them to go from village to village
 yah bada man he unka kyonki jeetne main unke koi dikkat nahin thi
 Still, she would win if she contested the election, but she said that it would not be justice
 phir bhi ham aagrah karenge ki wo chunaav laden
 My question does not arise because if anyone asks me, my body, mind, intellect and soul are there to work in Madhya Pradesh

 england cricket team ke madhyam gati ke gendbaaj stuart broad ne kaha he ki unke daaen kandhe kaa oparation karaane kii jarurat nahin he
 At the same time, he has admitted that in the current year he will not be able to provide his services to the English team

 The website 'euro Sport
com dot UK' quoted Broad as saying, "there is still pain in the shoulder
 ise thik hone main do maheene kaa samay lagegaa
 i hope i will be fully fit by the series played against Pakistan in January 2012
 " chot ke kaaran broad bharat ke saath khele gaye paanchaven or antim ekadivasiy mukaable se baahar ho gaye the
 Apart from this, Broad has also been dropped from two Twenty20 Internationals played with the West Indies
 english team ko westeindies ke saath 23 sitambar ko pehla twanti-20 muqabla khelnaa he jabaki 25 sitambar ko vah doosraa muqabla landan main hi khelegi
 The English team is scheduled to visit India in October where it has to play a series of five odis

 The good news for me is that i do not have to undergo a shoulder operation
 mujhe isse ubarne ke liye do maheene kaa samay lag saktaa he
 " har insaan kii khwaahish hoti he ki use aisa partner mili jo usko samaj sake
 If there is a fight, love will increase
 jisaki galat baat bhi sahi lage
 Let's know 7 things that boys look for in their future partners
 
 
 1
 Character- Being beautiful is a good thing, but your identity is made only by your actions
 ladke ladakiyon main ek achche kairactor kii talash karte hai jise sirf sajnaa sanvarna hi nahin balki is duniya ke saath kadam se kadam milakar chalanaa aata ho
 2
 budhimaani- yun to budhimaani sabko bahut pasand hoti he
 Boys also like girls who are intelligent
 jinamein nirnay lene kii kshamta hoti he
 Because relying on partner for every minor decision becomes cumbersome for boys
 3
 Respect- Respect is very important in a relationship
 jo ladkiyaan ladakon kaa sammaan karti hai or har faisle main saath khadi hoti hai wo ladakon ko bahut bhaati hai
 Boys spend their lives honoring girls who respect the family and friends of the boy
 4
 Attraction- Every boy wants his partner to be the most beautiful girl in the world
 ye sambhav nahin he, lekin kai baar aisa hota he ki koi itani pyaari lagane lag jaati he ki aap sundarataa ke paimaanon ko nakaar dete hai or prem main vihval hriday kaa bhav kanth se foot padataa he ki yahi duniya kii sabase khubasurat ladki he
 Therefore, boys give special attention to attraction in girls

 Self-confidence: The world can be won with confidence
 aatmavishvaas se ek sakaaratmak urja aati he jo har kisi ko urja se bhar detii he
 Boys also like girls who are confident
 6
 Ambition- It is said that there is no end to ambitions, one should live in contentment, but living in contentment becomes very boring
 man he to mahatvakanksha bhi hoti he
 Ambitious girls are very fond of boys

 Simplicity - Mirza was a lion of Ghalib that, 'who does not die on this simplicity, God, fight and does not even have a sword in his hand

 LK Advani gave the biggest support of his political life to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi 11 years ago
 saal 2002 main piem vaajapeyi gujarat dangon ke baad sakhti ke mood main the, magar adwani ke samajhane par bas raaj dharm nibhaane kii baat kahkar chup ho gaye or kuch hi maheene pehle keshubhai patel ko hataakar mukhyamantri banaae gaye modi batch gaye
 But three assembly elections have passed since then, in which the victory made Modi's stature even bigger than the party
 vahiin adwani ke netritv main bijepi pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav buree tarah haar chuki he
 Despite this, Advani is still seeing his central role in the party and for this it is very important for him to remain in the Lok Sabha
 or ab iske liye adwani modi kaa kisi bhi tarah se sahaara nahin lenaa chaahate
 If sources are to be believed, Advani has decided that he will not contest the next Lok Sabha election from Gandhinagar seat in Gujarat
 iske bajaay vah madhyapradesh kii bhopal yaa indore seat se maidan main utar sakate hai
 Gujarat BJP leaders also confess this in a tongue-in-cheek
 adwani ke gandhinagar seat chhodane kii vajah bhi party kaa local cader or modi hi hai
 Ever since Narendra Modi was at a very junior level in the party, LK Advani has been contesting from this seat since 1991
 91 ke loksabhaa chunaav main adwani iske alaava nai dilli seat se bhi chunaav ladakar jite the
 He defeated Rajesh Khanna in Delhi
 magar tab adwani ne gandhinagar seat ko chunaa or nai dilli seat se istipha de diya
 Since then, he has been continuously winning elections from Gandhi Nagar seat
 desh main endie kii lahar ho yaa na ho, unhen sansad pahunchane main dikkat nahin ai
 But this did not happen in the last election
 2004 main vah 2 lakh 17 hajaar voton se chunaav jite the, magar paanch saal baad jeet kaa antar ghatakar 1 lakh rah gaya
 That too became possible when Advani had to spend a lot of time on Gandhinagar seat by cutting back on proposed tours in other areas of the country
 itnaa hi nahin unke parivaar ke log chunaav puraa hone tak bas yaheen camp kiye rahe
 If party sources are to be believed, then Advani understood that this seat was not his safe fort
 or iske asurakshit hone main modi sarkaar ke ek faisle kaa bhi haath tha
 a few months before the Lok Sabha elections, Modi gave a free hand to an anti-encroachment campaign in the state capital
 iske chalate gandhi nagar main aise saikadon mandiron ko raste se hataa diya gaya tha, jo avaidh rup se kabja kar bane the yaa phir jo sadak chaudee karne main aade aa rahe the
 This caused a lot of resentment among the local people about the BJP
 local party varkar bhi adwani ke abhiyaan ko lekar zyada utsahit nahin dikhe
 Talking about the recent situation, Advani has been curbing Modi's ambition for PM
 iske liye khud apni daavedaari kii baat karne ke bajaay bijepi ke bujurg netaa madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii aad le rahe hai
 Against Modi's claim of Vikas Purush, Advani does not forget to take Shivraj's name from the party platform again and again
 shivaraj bhi sarkaar ke bade kaaryakramon main unase hi adhyakshata karavaate hai
 In such a situation, what else would be better for Advani than Madhya Pradesh

 com / 1s0umiggux — ANI (@ani_news) February 21, 2017 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon kii ghoshnaa se thik pehle samaajawaadee party ne apane 325 ummidavaaron kii suchi jari kar di he
 Through this list of SP, party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has shocked his son Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, and also surprised the state's fourth largest political party Congress
 aisa isliye kyonki congress or samaajawaadee party ke bich gathbandhan tay mana ja rahaa tha or siton ke bantwaare par maamla atka hua tha
 Mulayam has released a list of 325 candidates and has given the message that whatever talks will take place will be around the remaining 78 seats
 sawaal ye he ki kya congress ko mulaayam dwaara khinchi gai ye lakeer manjuur hogi?chunaavon ko lekar sabase pehle active hui thi congressupi chunaavon kii baat karen to congress pehali party thi jisane jorshor se isaki taiyaariyaan shuru kin

 27 saal-upi behaal kaa naaraa diya gaya or khaat sabhaaon jaise nae prayog kiye gaye
 At one point it seemed that the Congress was ready to show full power in the UP elections, but in the midst of all this, the news of the meeting of Prashant Kishore and SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav in the first week of November surprised everyone
 tab se congress or sapa ke gathbandhan kii atakalein jari thim or inhen atakalon ke bich mulaayam ne 325 ummidavaaron kii list jari kar di he
 After the meeting with Prashant Kishore and Mulayam, Kayasprant Kishore's meeting with Mulayam Singh sparked speculation about the alliance between the Congress and the SP
 congress ke tamaam netaa ye tark dete rahe ki prashanth kishor ke kisi netaa se milane kaa arth ye nahin he ki us party se congress gathbandhan karegi lekin aisi safai se itar ghatnakram aisa chalata rahaa jo gathbandhan ke kayaason main dam bharta rahaa
 At an event in Delhi, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav surprised everyone by saying that SP will form the government on its own but if it forms an alliance with Congress, they will together win more than 300 seats
 iske baad pichley din hi khabar ai ki congress, ajit singh kii rashtriya lokdal or samaajawaadee party main mahabandhan takreeban final ho gaya he or sapa in donon partiyon ke liye takreeban sau siten chhod degi
 But the very next day of these reports, Akhilesh Yadav himself handed over the list of his favorite candidates to Mulayam for all 403 seats and Mulayam has also finalized the tickets for 325 candidates
 ek-duusare keetarif karte najar aikhilesh-rahulabataya jaataa he ki mulaayam congress ke saath gathbandhan ke liye taiyaar to hai lekin iske liye khud pahal karne kaa unka koi iraadaa nahin he
 At the same time, Mulayam wants a coalition on his own terms because he knows that any such alliance is more compulsion of Congress than Samajwadi Party
 udhar, congress bhi jaanati he ki pichley kuch samay se use chunaavon main lagaataar haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 If we talk about this time, then the only major state with Congress is Karnataka
 uttarakhand main bhi upi ke saath chunaav hone hai jabaki himachal main is saal ke ant main chunaav honge
 In such a situation, she wants to join a coalition against BJP like Bihar to ensure its participation in power in some way
 rahul gandhi bhi upi kii apni reliyon main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party kii bajaay modi sarkaar or bijepi ko nishane par le rahe hai
 This is in stark contrast to his 2012 election campaign when he used to repeat the 'elephant note eats' at each of his meetings while attacking the ruling BSP
 tab akhilesh yadav bhi rahul kaa majaak udaate najar aate the
 He had quipped that Rahul should not jump from the stage in jubilation after the incident that broke the much talked-about list in Rahul's meeting
 uske mukaable is baar akhilesh yadav or rahul gandhi ek-duusare ko acha ladkaa qaraar dete hai
 Congress is compelled, alliance is necessary
according to political experts, the Congress wants to play the stakes on Akhilesh's clear image and his development agenda
 wo khud ko samaajawaadee party kii bajaay akhilesh yadav kii sahyogi banakar khadi dikhnaa chaahati he taaki unki image kaa phayda uthaaya ja sake
 In UP, the Congress won 22 and 28 seats respectively in the last two assembly elections
 loksabhaa chunaav main to sonia-rahul ke alaava party kaa koi pratyaashee nahin jeet sakaa
 In such a situation, she does not want to lose this time
 akhilesh yadav sarkaar ke khilaaf pradesh main koi bada anti inkambansee factor najar nahin aa rahaa
 In such a situation, even if the party allies with the SP, it will not be called a situation like agreement with the principles for it
 udhar akhilesh bhi sapa main jis tarah andruni ghamaasan se jujh rahe hai unhen congress kaa baahar se mil rahaa samarthan thodi majbootee detaa he
 In such a situation, it should not be surprising that there should be amendments in this list of Mulayam and in the assembly elections, the SP and the Congress appear on the same platform

 In their complaint, the regional block education officer has accused journalist Pawan Jaiswal and a representative of the local village head of being part of the conspiracy hatched to defame the state government

 The BJP has a Mahabharata and its latest chapter is associated with Rajasthan
 vasundhara raaje ne apane ek pratidwandvi netaa kii yatra par adnga lagaate hue istife kii dhamkee kya di, vasundhara ke samarthan main 51 bijepi vidhayak istife de chuke hai
 Now BJP President Nitin Gadkari is upset and he has assigned the responsibility of persuading Arun Jaitley to Vasundhara Raje
 bijepi main kai maharathi hai, jo do saal baad dilli kii gaddi par baithne kaa haseen khwab dekh rahe hai
 The way the Mahabharata is created inside the Bharatiya Janata Party, which emphasizes gait and character
 bijepi ke mahabharat main taaja adhyay he vasundhara raaje kii chunauti
 The arrival of Vasundhara in the core committee of the party in Jaipur raised such slogans as if a contest was being held in Rajasthan to prove him the leader of the greatest stature
 darasal, rajasthan bijepi ke bade netaa gulabchand kataaria mewar main lok jaagran yatra nikaalnaa chaahate the or vasungharaa raaje nahin chaahati thim ki kataaria yatra nikaalen
 This issue was to be discussed in the meeting
 kataaria sangh ke sabase kareebi netaaon main hai is naate ve gadakari ke bhi khaas hai
 Vasundhara Raje, considered close to the anti-gadkari camp in the BJP, does not want to miss any opportunity to clash with Kataria
 vasundhara raaje kii kareebi or bijepi kii rashtriya mahasachiv kiran maheshwari pehle se hi kataaria kii yatra kaa virodh kar rahi thim
 In such a situation, Gadkari had already said that the decision on the journey will be decided in the Jaipur meeting itself
 jab meeting shuru hui to kor cameti ke zyaadaatar log kataaria kii yatra ke paksh main khadey ho gaye, jisase naaraaz hokar vasundhara raaje baahar nikal gayi or istife kaa elaan kar diya
 Out of 78, 51 BJP mlas submitted their resignations
 jaahir he vasundhara kaa brahmastra kaam kar gaya
 The high command had to bow down and Kataria canceled her visit
 vasundhara ne red signal dikhaaya, to alaakaman ne bhi signal badal diya or kataaria kii gaadi chalane se pehle hi pankchar ho gai
 Gadkari's disgrace in Delhi is different

 The college that has this card is named Bangalore PG College
 haalanki piji college ne ai card ke apane yahaan ke hone kaa khandan kiya he
 It is being told that each terrorist was given an I-card from one of the colleges in India
 saath hi aatankwaadiyon ko 6400 rupee bhi die gaye thea
 Photo copy of i-card is available till date

 One thing is clear from this, thinking does not have boundaries
 faminist se lekar lesbian-ge-bisexual-transgender or queer (algebiticu) gender se jude saare andolan barabari or sweekaaryata kii ‘soch’ se upje hai
 From India, America, Britain to Nigeria, the battle of gender was fought in every corner of the world
 khayr, andolanon kaa itihaas phir kabhi
 Because the purpose of this article is not to curse the evil attitude of Gender's high-pitched thinking, but to tell the results of a study related to it
 gender ke nichle darje ke maane jane vaale log apane haq ke liye ab tak ladate rahe
 The issue of equality between women and men has not ended and now the whole rainbow of gender is standing in front
 bharat main bhi is puure indradhanush ko kanoonee manyata mil chuki he
 But as decades after getting legal rights, there has been a root of non-equality between men and women, for now it will take a time to completely change it
 khayr chhodie
 Change happens with change
 lekin yah kam hi log jaanate honge ki gender aadhaarit gaiyr barabari kii soch ek kuriti ke alaava hamaari khushiyon ke raste main bhi bada roda he
 If not sure, then read this recent study
 Equality of Life: a cross-national Analysis of the Effect Of Gender Equality on Life Satisfaction sheershak se andre adet or harvad skool main professor heley or carnor ne ek shodh kiya
 This study provides statistical data that countries with gender equality or non-equal thinking countries are ranked lower in the index of well-being than gender equalization
 ise yun bhi kah sakate hai ki gender equality se ‘khushhaali’ bhi aati he
 For this, biological and psychological tests based on Gender Empowerment Measure (GIM, Gender Development Index (GDI), Gender Inequality Index (GI), Gender Gap Index (GGI)) were conducted
 inke jariye shiksha, sehat, vetan, raajnneeti, udyog, vot daalane ke adhikaar ke liye chale andolan samet kai anya gairbarabari suchakon ke bare main sawaal puche gaye
 The data obtained from these were analyzed based on the standards set for life satisfaction
 report ke mutabik jaise-jaise gender inequality se gender equality vaale deshon kii taraf badhate gaye logon main life satisphaction bhi badhata gaya
 This not only increased in women, but also increased the level of life satisfaction in both men and women
 jaise gender inequality vaale desh japan ke mukaable gender equality vaale desh denmark ke logon ke bich life satisphaction kaa str ooncha paaya gaya
 Countries in the United States, Canada, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and Europe were included in this study
 is adhyayan main aurat or mardon do hi gender shaamil the, lekin aise samay main jab kai or gender barabari kii ladaai lard rahe hai to is shodh kaa mahatv or bhi bad jaataa he
 How is the relationship between happiness and gender equality? Question, is there any way between happiness and gender equality? So most people would answer, gender equality improves the lives of women
 bas kha gaye na gachha
 Hey brother, weigh first, then speak
 iconomi se soshal tak, manovaigyanik se biological tak aise shondhon kaa ambara laga padaa he jahaan par gender equality desh kii samruddhi se lekar ghar tak kii pragati ke liye jaruri maani gai he
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) report, titled Women, Work and Economy, clearly states that the non-equalization between women and men in the workplace is fatal to the economy
 vaishvik arthvyavastha ko oonchai tak le jane main gender equality ahm bhoomika nibhaataa he
 According to Norwegian sociologist Oyston Gulweg Holter, people of countries with gender equality are less likely to suffer from 'depression'
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘ yah saamaanya dharna he ki auraton ko barabari kaa darja dene kaa matlab he ki mardon ke hakon or unke liye maujuud suvidhaon main katautee
 Believe it is just a misunderstanding
 iske vipareet ‘barabari kaa darja’ jindagi kii jimmedaariyon kaa bantwaaraa he
 "it would not be wrong to say that if the chains of gender-based high lowliness are broken, then the doors of prosperity will open with a window of happiness
 sachaai to yah he ki vaishvik gaanv main tabdeel ho chuki is duniya ko ‘khushistan’ banane kaa rasta isi bhedbhaav vaali soch kii diwaar ke paar se hokar jaataa he

 pichhali modi sarkaar rojgaar ke morche par vifaltaa ko lekar lagaataar vipaksh ke nishane par rahi he
 Many government organizations have also admitted that there has not been a substantial increase in employment
 haalanki sarkaar isse inkaar karti rahi he
 Schemes like Mudra Loan Scheme have been relied upon in the last term to increase employment
 ab jab phir se ek baar modi sarkaar bani he to isse yuvaaon ko kaaphi ummid he
 So now everyone's eye is on whether Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents a concrete plan to increase employment in the budget to be presented on July 5? Unemployment rate at 45 years high! Unemployment figures in India for last few months There is a debate about haal hi main kendriya sankhyikee karyaalay (siesao) ne berogari ke aankade jari kiye hai
 These figures stated that the unemployment rate in the country is at the highest level of 45 years
 siesao kii report ko sarkaar ne bhi sweekaar kiya tha, lekin baad main sansad main shram mantri (swatantra prabhaar) santosh gangavar ne in aankadon ko bhraamak bataaya
 However, Gangwar said that employment generation is the priority of the government
 'bajet 2019 kii vistrut kawarej ke liye yahaan clic karen'gangavar ne bataaya ki pradhanmantri kii rojgaar srijan kaarykram (piemaijipi) kii vajah se 31 march 2019 tak 5,86,728 rojgaar die gaye or pradhanmantri mudra yojana (PMMY) ke tahat 31 march tak 18
 26 crore loans have been distributed

 8 per cent of youth are unemployed, compared to 5 in rural areas
 3 fisadi he
 It is important to know the reason for unemployment
 If unemployment is at a high level in the first term of the government, there are many factors that cannot be solved without knowing this
 arthvyavastha kii raftaar dhimi pad gai he
 Growth rate of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) 5 in the fourth quarter of FY 2018-19
 8 fisadi rahi joki pichley paanch saal main sabase kam he
 Employment of factories has declined as manufacturing has become sluggish
 upbhog kam hone se companiyon kii bikri ghati he
 Car sales had reached an eight-year low
 isaki vajah se corporate jagat bhi abhi nivesh main hichak rahaa he
 In its last phase, the Modi government also kept a check on expenses
 sarkari vibhaagon main bhi bhartiyon par ankush lagaai gai
 All these reasons did not create enough employment and unemployment has increased
 antarim bajet main kya hughantarim bajet pesh karte hue kendriya mantri piyush goyal ne kaha tha ki duniya bhar main rojgaar kii avadharana badal rahi he
 Now employment generation is not limited to factories or government jobs

 janata main loksabhaa chunaav kaa kautuhal badhata ja rahaa he
 Political parties are in full swing
 aaazaad bharat ke itihaas main pehali baar dikh rahaa he ki media ne apana bhoot, vartmaan, bhavishya sab kuch jhonk diya he
 But still it is not clear what will become the main issue of the election
 pehle aisa kabhi nahin hua ki chunaav main ginati ke din bache hon or yah pataa na chale ki mukhya mudda kya banegaa
 It may be that the electoral priests have sensed something, but they are not telling yet
 ho yah bhi saktaa he ki iskaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa ho ki pehle gathbandhanon kii ek nishchit shakl ban jaae phir vakyuddh shuru ho
 Nevertheless, what has been said so far to maintain the atmosphere from the power and opposition, an issue is definitely coming out - that is, remove the government or save the government
 is mudde par gajab kii amrai : vaaki yah hairat kii baat he
 Both the power and the opposition have accepted that it is the issue to remove or save the Modi government
 yah bhi kam hairat kii baat nahin he ki isaki shuruyaat satta kii taraf se hui thi
 Probably sensing the atmosphere, the ruling people first started saying that the opposition wants to remove the Modi government
 haalanki sattaruudhon kii is baat kaa mazaaq bhi uda tha
 The joke was because it is a universal and eternal fact that this is what the opposition always wants in politics
 jabaki mudde ve kaaran banate hai ki sarkaar ko kyon hataanaa chahie
 However, this time many issues have been prepared to remove the government
 khaastaur par pichley chunaav main jo naare lagaakar yah sarkaar satta main ai thi, ve naare hi chunavi mudde ke taur par taiyaar hai
 For example, dreams of jobs to the youth, promises of prosperity of farmers, small businessmen, eradication of corruption and many other such promises
 sarkaar hataane ke liye unheen vaadon-naaron ko is baar chunavi mudda bananaa tha, ban rahe hai or aakhir main banenge bhi
 But currently the sentiment in the media's decorated electoral market is more of an alliance issue
 khaastaur par vipakshi dalon ke gathbandhan ke mudde kaa
 Whereas the elements of electoral issues are not visible in this matter
 yah kyon nahin ban saktaa chunavi mudda : gathbandhan bhartiya raajnneeti main saadhaaran-si baat ho chuki he
 Whether it is the ruling party or the opposition, it includes a variety of political parties
 koi bhi daawa nahin kar saktaa ki vah akele baaki sab se lard legaa
 Not at all in a democracy like India
 vaise loktantr main jahaan jati or dharm ke aadhaar par anyaay or shoshan hone laga ho, garib or amir kii khai achaanak chaudee ho gai ho or krishi or udyog ke bich khullamakhulla bhedbhaav bad chalaa ho
 Why not consider the politics of coalition as a political boon to represent the interests of all in a democratic country with economic disparities of region, language, food, and economic status
 And if we look at the political philosophy, different ideologies are accepted in democracy
 is aadhaar par bhinn-bhinn vichaardhaaraon ke bich samya ke liye gathbandhan se acha vikalp ho bhi kya saktaa he
 And when almost all political parties of the party and the opposition are accepting the philosophy of coalition, then it should be called the right side of democracy
 lekin is vishay par agar sarvasammati ho, to vah chunavi mudda to bilkul nahin ban saktaa
 That is, the actual main issue or issue of the election is yet to be decided
 lekin itnaa tay he : sampradayikta kaa ufaan mudda banegaa hi
 Suddenly sudden unemployment cannot exist without being an electoral issue
 desh kii aadhi se zyada aabaadi vaale gaanv yaa kisaan mudda banenge hi
 In a different way, half of the country's population, that is, women's grief, is probably going to be included in the list of electoral issues for the first time
 raajnneeti main shaashvat ban chukaa bhrashtachar kaa mudda is baar ke chunaav main bhi bedakhal nahin ho paaegaa, masalan notebandi or rafel
 No one has ever stopped the raising of all the regional and local level issues in the Lok Sabha elections, so they will stay this time also, but this time they can stand up with some more intensity, because this time the alliance of opposition The main basis of this is to give representation to regional aspirations
 or yah bhi tay he : paanch saal ke liye desh kii manegeri kaa license paae sattaruudhon ke paas se yah kehane kaa mauka jaataa rahaa he ki vah desh main ghi-doodh kii nadiyaan baha denge
 Anyway, he came to power by raising a similar slogan
 yani vipaksh ko apni taraf se zyada sapane dikhaane yaa zyada vaayade odhane kii jarurat hi nahin padani chahie
 The opposition coalition has a legitimate and golden opportunity to remind them of the previous promises of the ruling
 sattaruudhon kii mazaboori hogi ki ve kachche-pakke jo bhi paaramparik bachaav uplabdh hai, unheen main lage rahen, or agar ve bachaav karne main kamjor pad gaye, to iske alaava chaara hi kya bachataa he ki apni taraf se or apane tarafdaar media ke zariye vipaksh kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthavaate rahen
 Another difficult problem for the government: the ruling parties will certainly be very upset by the patience of their main rival Congress
 congress ne apni anbhavi budhimatta se khud ko vipakshi gathbandhan kii aguwai karne se bachaae rakhaa
 He allowed the coalition to work naturally, saving his time, energy, resources and credibility
 congress ne zyada dakhal nahin diya
 Who can deny that the heavy work done by the opposition coalition so far also goes in the interest of the Congress
 lihaaza sattarudh gathbandhan aaj tak apane mukhya pratidwandvi congress par hamalon kaa mauka hi nahin nikaal paa rahaa he
 Electoral analysts should not forget that in 115 seats of the Lok Sabha, where the direct contest is being seen, in most of the seats, the ruling will have to take on the Congress directly
 itnaa hi nahin, congress ne baaki 430 siton par sabhavit gathbandhan ke saath ranneetik saajheedaari ke vikalp bachaakar rakhe hai
 Overall, the number of problems in pre-poll alliances are not visible this time
 kam se kam yah to tay ho hi gaya he ki koun-koun se vipakshi dal apane-apane saajheedaaron ke saath baithne-chalane ko taiyaar hai
 That is, there is a large basis to estimate that if more than one coalition of opposition parties is formed, then the option of partnership between those coalitions is still open

 is dauraan shatrughna sinha ne bijepi chhodane se lekar bijepi main laalkrishna adwani or anya bade netaaon kii andekhi par bhi baat kii
 At the same time, he (shatrughan Sinha) also told what was the reason that forced him to leave the BJP
 NDTV se baatcheet main shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki congress main shaamil hone se pehle unke paas kai partiyon se ofer tha
 He (shatrughan Sinha) said that i had an offer to join the party on behalf of AAP, Mamta Banerjee, Mayawati, Akhilesh ji
 saath hi lalu ji kii family se bhi nyauta mila tha
 But i did not go to his party
 isaki ek vajah to yah he ki main kisi neshnal party se hi judana chahta tha
 Shatrughan Sinha said that i had tweeted before leaving the party that if you remove me, then remember the law of Newton, which says that every action has a reaction
 mere is twit kii vajah se hi vah mujhe party se baahar nahin nikaal paae
 Shatrughan Sinha said that the decision to leave the party was taken when Ravi Shankar Prasad was given a ticket from Patna Sahib instead of me
 unhone kaha ki ravishankar prasad ko tikat die jane ke baad hi maine soch liya tha ki ab bahut ho chukaa he, main ab party main nahin rah saktaa
 i saw that the party had also treated big leaders like Murali Manohar Joshi, Advani ji and Jashwant Sinha
 shutraghn sinha ne kaha ki maine pehle hi party se kaha tha ki mujhe nikaalnaa he to nikaal do lekin main khud nahin jaaoongaa
 But i left the party myself because Ravi Shankar Prasad was given a ticket from Patna Sahib
 unhone kaha ki meri pehali pasand patna thi duusari bhi patna bhi auki teesri bhi patna sahib thi
 i am not against Ravi Shankar Prasad, he is my good friend
 lekin main party ke faisle se naaraaz tha
 Shatrughan Sinha said that today people understand the party for which we have given our lives
 aaj vahi party adwani ji jaise bade netaa kaa apmaan kar rahi he
 Advaniji - Murali Manohar Joshi ji does not even have an option to go anywhere else
 par mere paas tha
 What BJP leaders are doing with Advani is wrong
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ko do siton se do sau siton tak pahanchane ne adwani ji kaa yogadan he
 The senior leaders of the party did the same with Arun Shourie, with Murali Manoharji
 yah sab sochane kii jarurat he, log dekh rahe hai
 The one man show is two man army in BJP
 bijepi ke bade netaaon main ghabrahat he
 There is no central minister in today's BJP government
 bachche ko bhi paanch mantri kaa naam yaad nahin
 Because all the work is being done by the PMO
 ham bhi mantri rahe the lekin hamen kisi ne kuch karne se nahin roka na hi us samay hamaara kaam piemo se hota tha
 Shatrughan Sinha lashed out at PM Modi and said that those who could not keep their own words, could not fulfill their promises, who could not improve the condition of the farmers, whether it was 15 lakhs or two crore jobs
 wo sab jo nahin kar sake
 Who is not listening to the call of the country
 jo apane logon se baat tak nahin kar rahaa he
 Overnight, the bagger, who asks demonetisation without asking anyone, will listen to us
 chaahe jiesti kii ho yaa phir rafel kii baat ho sab kshetra main bijepi fail he
 He said that i joined Congress because it has been the party of Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv and Rahul, which have contributed a lot to the independence of the country
 duusari baat yah mukhya dhara kii party he
 This is the National Party
 mere liye neshnal party kaa rasta sahi laga
 i had offers to join the party on behalf of you, Mamta Banerjee, Mayawati, Akhilesh ji
 saath hi lalu ji kii family se bhi nyauta tha
 But i did not go to his party
 yah puche jane par ki bihar main to congress he nahin lekin aapane phir bhi kyon chunaa
 Shatrughan Sinha said that even the family of Lalu ji told me that if you do not want to come with us now, then definitely go with the Congress and strengthen the Congress
 yahi vajah he ki is baar phir mahagathbandhan ne patna sahib kii seat congress ke liye rigerv rakhi thi
 Did you win from Patna Sahib because you were from BJP but Shatrughan Sinha said that i think it is not the seat of the party, it is the seat of Bihar, the one who does well here gets this seat
 yah seat kai baar duusare ke paas bhi gai he
 People here vote on the basis of karni
 main agar yahaan se record margin se jeeta tha to vah sabhi kii vajah se jeeta tha
 Shatrughan Sinha said that the BJP has its own say on the issue of security of the nation regarding pulwama-balakot
 yah bijepi ke prachaar tantra kaa hissaa he
 No one is a traitor in our country
 lekin aisa kaha gaya ki jo aapaki baat se sahamat nahin hua to vah deshadrohi hua
 When asked for evidence on Balakot, Shatrughan Sinha said that till date no one has asked for any evidence
 khud bijepi ke mantri ne alag-alag bayaan dekar bhram paidaa kiya he
 That is why people are asking that now tell so that the martyr's family also has support
 piem modi or atal bihari vaajapeyi ke samay kii sarkaar kii tulana par shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki vaajapeyi ji or adwani ji ke daur main or aaj ke daur main bahut kaa antar he
 At that time it was a democracy but today it is a dictatorship
 aaj van main sho or tu main army kii party banakar rah gai he
 i am not against Modi, i am against his policies and promise
 unhone aaj tak ek bhi press conference nahin karte he
 Scripted press conference is not a matter of
 vah aapke saath yaa raveesh kumaar ke saath press conference kyon nahin karte
 Asking questions is not treason
 adwani ji atal ji ke samay mantri ko kaam karne diya jaataa tha
 Work was not done through PMO
 aaj saare kaam piemo se kar rahaa he
 Due to demonetisation, the lives of people queuing up all over the country have been changed
 lekin, agar aap viipi hai to aapke liye raat main bhi bank khol kar note jamaa karne or badalane samet saare kaam ho sakate hai
 Similar news has emerged from the stable of Uttar Pradesh

 Meanwhile, around four o'clock, a new currency arrived in the branch
 dekhte hi dekhte isaki jaankaree khaas logon tak bhi pahunch gai
 What does the bank manager say about the VIP treatment of the minister? When asked about the VIP treatment being given to the minister, branch manager Mohammad Javed Khan, he flatly refused to do such a thing
 branch manager ne kaha ki bank kaa samay subah 9:30 baje se dopaher baad 3:30 baje tak kaa graahakon ke lenden ke liye he
 There was no cash in the day on Wednesday, the cash came at 4 o'clock in the evening, even after the end of the bank time, the cash was changed
 jab branch manager se poocha gaya ki sirf mantri or unke saath aae logon kaa hi kaam kyon kiya gaya, aam janata kaa kyon nahin to iskaa koi jawaab nahin mila
 Minister said- i changed the money like ordinary people, when Iqbal Mahmood was asked about this, he said, 'I did not have money then went to the bank to get money
 mere donon bete bhi mere saath the
 When i reached the bank, the bank was open and there were employees present
 ' mantri ne ye daawa bhi kiya ki unhone aam logon kii tarah hi apane paise badale
 Decision on demonetisation: Anti-people Iqbal Mehmood termed the decision taken by the Modi government as anti-people
 ikbaal mahmud ne kaha, 'janata is faisle se pareshaan he
 The common man is dying
 har taraf afra-tafari he
 We have withdrawn money by putting ourselves in line
 agar koi isse khush ho saktaa he to wo pradhanmantri hi ho sakate hai

 laabh ke pad maamle main aam aadmi party ke 20 vidhayakon kii sadsyta jane ke maamle kii sunwaayee ab dabl bench main hogi
 The Delhi High Court has sent the petition of mlas to the bench
 nyaayamurti vibhu baakhru kii peeth ne kaaryvahak mukhya nyaayadhish kii peeth ke samaksh kal maamle kii sunwaayee nirdhaarit kii
 Acting Chief Justice Geeta Mittal can either set up a new bench or refer it to the existing two-member bench
 adaalat ne apane 24 janvari ke aadesh kii avadhi badha di he
 The court had stayed the Election Commission notification for the by-election to fill 20 seats in the vacant assembly after disqualifying the mlas
 adaalat kaa nirdesh tab aayaa jab adhivaktaa prashanth patel ne maamle ko do sadasyeey peeth ko saunpane ke liye aavedan diya
 Prashant Patel had petitioned the High Court that such cases cannot be heard by a single judge, so it should be transferred to double bench
 arji main kaha gaya he ki supreme court kaa nirdesh he ki ellection pitishan sirf dabl bench hi sun sakati he
 The interim stay on the by-election of the court will remain, that is, elections cannot be declared in these seats of Delhi before hearing the petition
 aam aadmi party ke 20 vidhayakon ke maamle main dilli hai court ne kaha he ki is maamle ko dobaaraa acting chif justise gita mittal ke paas bheja gaya or sunwaayee ab dobaaraa ab sanjeev sachdeva kii bench main hogi
 The Delhi High Court held a hearing for nearly half an hour on Monday in the expulsion case of 20 mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party and for half an hour, there was a debate only on whether the court of single bench had the right to hear the case
 Advocate v Vishwanathan of Aam Aadmi Party expelled MLA Kailash Gehlot argued in the court that you accept the case and you have the right to hear the case
 lihaaja, aap hi maamle ko sunen
 While Judge Vibhu Bhakharu, citing an order of the Supreme Court, said that in this order it is clearly written that any matter which is related to the election
 use dabl bench hi sunegi jabaki chunaav ayog ke vakil amit sharma or centre sarkaar ke vakil anil soni ne bhi hai court se kaha ki supreme court ke aadesh ke mutabik is maamle kii sunwaayee dabl bench hi kare
 On Patel's petition, the Election Commission recommended the President to disqualify the AAP mlas
 baad main is sifarish ko raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne manjuuri de di thi
 These petitions have been filed by eight AAP mlas, challenging the Centre's notification disqualifying 20 party mlas for holding office of profit
 ucch nyaayalay ne isse pehle kaarywahi se sambandhit samoochaa record talab kiya tha, jiske baad chunaav ayog ne 20 aap vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraane kii sifarish kii thi or raashtrapati ne use 20 janvari ko manjuuri de di thi
 The legislators had expressed the apprehension of a by-election on Wednesday, during the hearing on Wednesday, on behalf of the mlas, that what has happened to them is an injustice
 sunwaayee ke dauraan vidhayakon ne somvaar tak chunaav kii ghoshnaa hone kii ashanka jataai thi
 On which the High Court had asked the Election Commission not to announce the by-election on this issue till Monday
 vidhayakon ne daleel di ki chunaav ayog ne unki baat nahin suni or nae chunaav ayukta opi ravat ne khud ko is sunwaayee se alag kar liya he
 The mlas claimed that there is no case of office of profit made against us
 dilli hoicourt ne is masale tab tak chunaav ayog upachunaav kii ghoshnaa naa karen
 This petition has been filed by a total of 8 former mlas out of the 20 mlas who lost membership after the President's order
 bataa den ki in ayogy vidhayakon ne raashtrapati ramnath kovind ke us notification ko radd karne ke liye dilli hai court kaa rukh kiya he, jiske baad dilli sarkaar ke ye vidhayak purv vidhayak ban gaye hai
 On Sunday, the President had disqualified that on January 21, on the recommendation of the Election Commission, President Ram Nath Kovind disqualified 20 Aam Aadmi Party mlas for holding office of profit
 chunaav ayog pehle hi in vidhayakon ko ayogy tehra chukaa tha
 After this, the AAP had also approached the Delhi High Court against the recommendation of the Election Commission
 jahaan hai court ne aap ke vidhayakon ko nirvachan ayog kii sifarish ke khilaaf antarim raahat dene se inkaar kar diya tha

 rose kii tarah suraj ke sokar uthte hemumbaiki life-line waapas patari par aa chuki thi
 To carry the burden of the metropolis crowd and reach them to their destination, but as the clock rang 10 suddenly the bell of Gorai Police Station rang
 phone karne vaale shaks nen police ko bataaya ki mumbai ke manori bich par ek laash padi he
 Since the corpse was found on the shore, the police team leaves for Manori beach as soon as the phone is received
 bich par pahunchate hi police hi police afasaron ke hosh ud jate hai
 The corpse's face was severely disfigured after the slaughter
 mumbai me gorai ilaake ke manori bich par subah ekaek police kii gahamagahami dekhakar bich par aaye log bhi sakate me aa gaye
 Seeing this corpse, it was felt that at first someone attacked the knives and later the assassins also spoiled the corpse with the stone lying nearby
 kaatilon kaa makasad saaf tha ki kisi bhi surat main marane vaale kii shinaakht naa ho sake
 The stone used in the murder was also present on the occasion, but whose body and who is the killer was a big challenge for the Mumbai Police
 shuruyaat main to kaatilon kii chaal kaamyaab hoti dikh rahi thi
 The corpse's face deteriorated, making it difficult to identify the corpse
 pulisavaalo ne laash ke kapado kii talaashi lee lekin suraag ke naam par kuch haath nahin laga
 The policemen caught sight of a mobile phone lying near the corpse
 police waalo ne mobile uthaaya or phir shuru hui maamle kii tafteesh
 It was revealed through mobile that the name of the person who died was Ramesh Dedhia
 ramesh mumbai ke malwani ilaake kaa rahane vaala tha or peshey se stock brokar he
 Now the police had climbed the first step of their investigation but it was not easy for the police to reach the murderer
 laash mumbai ke mashhoor bich par mili thi
 So the police was very alert
 jaanch main kisi bhi tarah kii dhilaai cese kharaab kar sakati thi
 Many big questions were standing in front of the police, for example, who is the killer of the stock broker? Who killed him? And who was the one who took so much risk and slaughtered it publicly on the shore? Another case had come in front of them to test the mindless officers of Mumbai Police
 police jald se jald qatl ke is cese ko sulajhaa lenaa chaahati thi lekin uski mushkil ye thi ki uske paas maktul kii pahchaan or ek adad mobile phone ke alaava aisa kuch bhi nahi tha jo kaatil kaa suraag de paata
 After all, Ramesh had such enmity with someone that the murderer had crushed the corpse's face with a stone and the biggest question was why the murderer chose the sea shore for the murder
 mumbai ke bich par hua ye katl police ke liye ek paheli bana hua tha
 This was the reason that the police wanted to reach the murderer at the earliest, but the difficulty was that the police could not give the clue of the murderer if there was nothing except the identity of the corpse and a single mobile phone
 aakhir koun share brokar ramesh dedhiya se kisi kii kya dushmani ho sakati he jo usko maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 What was the reason behind the killing so brutally and the biggest question is why the murderers chose the seashore for the murder
 chunki katl samandar ke kinare hua tha lihaaja police ko shaq hi nahi balki puraa yakeen tha ki ho naa ho kaatil dedhiya ke jaanane vaale the or unhone dedhiya ko bich par bulaayaa or chaakuo se godakar uskaa khun kar diya
 This case of murder was surrounded by hundreds of questions from all around, while the name of the clue was caught by the police, only the mobile phone of Ramesh Dedhia
 mobile phone ne hi dedhiya kii pahchaan bataai
 The police hoped that this mobile phone would also reach them to the murderer
 lihaaja police ne ramesh dedhiya ke phone records khangalane shuru kar die
 When the police got the phone call records of Dedhia, the police were shocked to see her
 ramesh jitani baat apni bivi se nahin karata usase zyada apni bivi kii bahan yani saali kii beti se kiya karata tha
 At first glance, the suspicion of the police went to Ramesh's niece but only then did the police see another thing in Ramesh's call records
 ramesh kii maut se pehle uski aakhri baar baat bhi juhi se hi hui thi
 This much doubt was enough for the police to take Juhi into custody and Juhi was detained for questioning
 police ne poochtacha shuru kii
 Initially, the police kept denying that Juhi had any involvement in this massacre, but when the police showed strictness, Juhi broke down and came up with a story of sex, conspiracy and murder that would make everyone's senses fly
