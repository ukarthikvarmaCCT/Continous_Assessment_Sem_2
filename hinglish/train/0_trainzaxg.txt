 karodon kaa nuksaan, lakhon kii naukari jaae or on ricard bolne kaa khatara itnaa bada ho jaae to phir is baat ko bhi yaheen darj kar chalanaa chahie
 So the work of 50 lakh workers is lost

 Some people say that their product is not good and they are unable to compete

 When you do not buy clothes, there will be no demand for clothes, there will be no demand for clothes, there will be no demand for yarn, there will be no demand for yarn, there will be no demand for cotton
 april se june 2018 ke bich bharat ne 1064 million amareeki dollar kaa niryaat kiya tha
 India was able to export only US $ 695 million between April and June 2019
 yani ek saal ke bheetar niryaat main hi 35 pratishat kii kami aa gai
 We are telling all this from the report of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, which was submitted to Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on 16 August 2019

 You will be surprised to know that between April and June 2019, imports from Bangladesh increased by 40 percent

 Not only this, when yarn is exported from Vietnam, Indonesia, Pakistan and Cambodia, China does not charge any import duty from them but 3 from India
 5 fisadi se lekar 14 fisadi tak aayaat shulk vasuulata he
 Because of this, Indian threads are unable to survive in the Chinese market

 in donon tiimon ne lagaataar do maukon par vishwa khitaab jite hai
 The Indian team first won the World Cup in 1983 under the captaincy of Kapil Dev and then the second time it got a chance to become the World Champion in 2011, when the Indian team under Dhoni captained Sri Lanka
 dhoni ne kaha ki unke saathi vaishvik aayojanon ke dabaav ko jhelane ke kaabil hai or ve har lihaaj se vishwa cap ke liye khud ko taiyaar kar rahe hai
 Under Dhoni's leadership, India won the Champions Trophy title in England in 2013

 For this, we have to play to the best of our ability

 Australian all-rounder Mitchell Marsh is happy that fast bowler Mitchell Starc has worried the Indian batsmen
 stark ne pehle test match main acchhee farm main chal rahe ballebaaj cheteshwar pujaara or captain viraat kohli ko saste main out karke ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 "it is great if Stark is engrossed in the Indians," Marsh told reporters before the second Test
 ummid he ki vah hamaare liye aage bhi kuch mahatvapurn wicket hasil karegaa
 He described Stark as a great bowler in Indian conditions who can also achieve reverse swing
 marsh ne kaha, ‘‘yadi vah duniya kaa sarvshereshth gendbaaj nahin he to sarvshereshth gendbaajon main se ek he
 i believe that in these circumstances, while talking about spinners is still our main weapon
 ’’ unhone kaha ki stark or hejalwood donon kii puraani gend se wicket lene kii kshamta se australian team kaa vishwaas badha he ki vah bhartiya ballebaajon ko pareshaani main daal sakati he
 Marsh said, "the wicket in Pune has done a lot of work in our favor and not necessarily here too
 reverse swing hamaare liye behad ahm hogi
 We can use it properly
 hamaare paas do aise gendbaaj hai jo reverse swing karaane main maahir hai
 They are still deadly weapons for us
 ’’ marsh bhaiyon main chote bhai mishael ne puri tarah se turn le rahi pune kii pich par 76 genden kheli or aisa halke haathon se khilne se vah aisa kar paye

 ’’ tippaniyan The 25-year-old all-rounder said, "in these circumstances you have to get the right to attack and this is possible only with solid protection
" main isi par kaam kar rahaa hum
 After the match referee Chris Broad reported, the International Cricket Council also called the Pune wicket bad but Marsh did not want to comment on the pitch
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main is par tippanee nahin karuunga
 We play on a pitch of 22 yards and it is the same for both teams
 pich taiyaar kii gayi thi or ham us par khele

" meraa maananaa he ki in paristhitiyon main jabaki spinneron ko lekar baaten chal rahi he tab bhi hamaara mukhya astr he
 He said that the ability of both Stark and Hazlewood to take wickets with the old ball has increased the confidence of the Australian team that it can put the Indian batsmen in trouble
 marsh ne kaha, ‘‘pune main wicket ne hi hamaare paksh main kaaphi kaam kiya or jaruri nahin ki yahaan bhi aisa ho
 Reverse swing will be very important for us
 ham iskaa sahi upyog kar sakate hai
 We have two bowlers who specialize in reverse swing

 in Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, is enjoying a luxurious life in Rawalpindi Jail in Pakistan
 jail ke andar na sirf use mobile phone or internet uplabdh karaayaa gaya he, balki har din vah kai aagantukon se mulaakaat bhi karata he
 The lashkar-e-taiba acting commander Lakhvi is one of the prime suspects in the 2008 Mumbai attacks
 in hamalon main 160 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 According to a report released on Sunday by BBC Urdu, 55-year-old Lakhvi is lodged in Adiala jail along with six of his accomplices in the Mumbai attack
 jailer kii manjuuri se jail ke andar use ek televijan, mobile phone tathaa internet jaisi suvidhaayen uplabdh karai gai hai
 a jail official said, "lakhvi can meet any visitor any time of the week, any day
 ' The official said, 'visitors visiting him do not need to take permission from anyone, even they do not have to reveal their identity
 ' The incident may be surprising to anyone, but Pakistan's rulers are known to give such approval only because they believe that they may need them in the future
 gauratlab he ki bharat sarkaar ne lakhvi ko 26 / 11 mumbai hamale kaa ek pramukh sandigdh ghoshit kiya tha, jiske chaar din baad pakistan ne saat disambar, 2008 ko use giraftaar kiya tha
 Six years later, he once again came into the limelight when an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan ordered him to be granted bail in the Mumbai attack case
 apni aagaamee film 'bheja frai-2' ko lekar utsahit abhinetri minisha lamba ko lagata he ki kamedi ke kshetra main purush aage hai or is vidha main mahilaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar zyada kirdaar nahin gadhe jate
 Minisha's sent is an important character in Fry-2
 unhone kaha, mujhe lagata he kamedi mahilaon ke liye mushkil nahin he, lekin kamedi filmon main philhal mahilaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar zyada kirdaar nahin likhe jate
 
 
 These roles are mostly male dominated
 yah isliye hoka he, kyonki purush aise kai mazaakia samvaad bol sakate hai, jo mahilaon par achche nahin lagate
 The comments minisha ne kaha, jaise kuch ashleel yaa dwiarthi chutkule
 
 
 Women will not like to speak them
 purush kalakaar dwaara bole jane par hi ye prabhaav daalate hai
 After playing romantic in 'bachna Ae Haseeno', thriller in 'kidnap', and serious political roles in 'well Done Abba', Minisha now tries her hand at comedy through 'bheya Fry-2' and 'hum Tum Aur Shabana' Are going sagar ballari ke nirdesan main bani 'bheja frai-2' varsh 2007 main isi naam se bani safal film kaa sikwel he
 Minisha said, i have seen 'sent fry'
 yah film pehali film se ekadam alag he or iske kirdaar nae hai
 He said, My only character is the one who is not fryed by Bharatbhushan, my character sees his innocence and understands it
 minisha kaa bheja frai-2 main ek ahm kirdaar he
 He said, i think comedy is not difficult for women, but currently in comedy films more characters are not written keeping women in mind
 
 
 ye bhoomikaayen adhiktar purush pradhan hi hoti hai
 This is hoka, because men can speak many funny dialogues that do not suit women
 tippaniyan Minisha said, like some vulgar or double jokes
 
 
 mahilaayein inhen bolte hue acchhee nahin lagengi
 They exert influence only when spoken by a male artist
 'bachanaa e haseenon' main romantic, 'kidanap' main romaanchak, or 'wel dan abba' main gambhir raajnneetik kirdaar nibhaane ke baad minisha ab 'bheja frai-2' tathaa 'ham tum or shabana' ke jariye kamedi ke kshetra main haath aajamaane ja raheen hai
 Directed by Sagar Ballari, Bheya Fry-2 is a sequel to the successful film of the same name in 2007
 minisha ne kaha, maine 'bheja frai' dekhi he
 This film is completely different from the first film and its characters are new
 unhone kaha, ekmaatr meraa hi kirdaar he, jiskaa bheja bharatbhushan se frai nahin hota, meraa kirdaar uski maasoomiyat dekhtaa he or use samajhataa he

 After assuming the most powerful position in the world, now not only America, the entire world is eyeing Donald Trump
 20 janvari ko daftar sanbhaalane ke baad trump ne obama ke kai ahm faislon ko palata he
 Despite this, it is proving difficult for them to live up to the claims made during the election campaign
 pehle din toote 34 vaade!apane prachaar abhiyaan main trump ne america janata se kareeb 663 vaade kiye the
 Trump said that he would execute 36 of these on the very first day of assuming power
 lekin wo sirf 2 hi vaayadon kii kasuti par khare utar paae
 Trump took the first task to withdraw Obama's health program 'obamacare' after assuming important decisions on the first day
 trump lambey vakt se is kaarykram kii aalochana karte aae hai
 He assured to reduce the burden on the economy
 iske alaava trump ne sarkari niyuktiyon par roak lagane ke aadesh par bhi dastakhat kiye
 The aim is to reduce the government workforce
 vaade jo nahin hue purelekin donald trump ne drug dilers ke khilaaf pehle hi din karrwai karne kaa vaayada nahin nibhaayaa
 In October 2016, he assured voters that he would change Obama's immigration law within the first minute of becoming president, giving 2 years time to deport minor immigrants living in the US without papers
 lekin trump ne pehle din aisa koi faisla nahin liya
 Trump said in August 2016 that he would expel two million immigrants with criminal records from the US within the first hour of assuming the office of the President
 lekin aisa kuch nahin hua
 In the same way, Donald Trump did not meet the point of taking action against China on the first day
 bade faislein morchon par khara naa utarane ke baavjood donald trump ne white house main pehle hafte ke dauraan kuch ahm faisle liye hai
 These include the decision on Obamacare, as well as the withdrawal of the trans-pacific Agreement
 obama ne 2015 main is samjhaute par dastakhat kiye the or ise china ke 'van belt, van road' project kaa jawaab mana ja rahaa tha
 But in Trump's opinion, the deal was not beneficial to American producers
 saath hi trump ne raashtrapati banate hi aise samoohon kii funding roak di he jo garbhpaat ko badhaava dete hai
 The personality of CPM leader Jyoti Basu, who followed the idea of simple living, high thought, was such that not only the leaders of the party respected him
 shaayad hi kisi ne sochaa ho ki 1914 main madhyavargeey parivaar main janma ek ladkaa bengal kii dharti kaa laal kehalaayegaa
 Will become the Chief Minister of Bengal 5 times
 lekin 1936 main jab jyoti basu ne siyaasi duniya main kadam rakhaa to put ke paanv paalane main hi dikhne lage
 Although he had to struggle a lot in the initial phase, but he kept on going
 1946 main jyoti basu bengal vidhansabha ke sadsy chune gaye
 When CPI broke in 1964, Jyoti Da was one of the nine members of the CPI Marxist Politburo
 1967 or 1969 main jyoti basu pashchim bengal ke up mukhyamantri chune gaye
 After this, it was Jyoti Da's era
 21 june 1977 se 6 november 2000 tak jyoti basu bengal ke mukhyamantri kii kursi par bane rahe
 Such an occasion also came in 1996, when everyone started seeing Jyoti Basu as the Prime Minister of the country
 piem kii kursi bhi bas ek kadam dur rah gai thi, lekin devegoda kii siyaasi chaal baari pad gai or jyoti da pradhanmantri banate-banate rah gaye
 Jyoti Da also did not have any effect in the party-changing phase of politics
 bengal main laal jhanda ooncha karne vaale jyoti da aakhri dam tak communist party se hi jude rahe
 Basu Da, the country's most popular communist leader, may not be among us today but his memories will always be fresh in the hearts of millions
 suuni ho gai bengal kii siyasat
 The political Lal of Bengal went into a world from which no one comes back
 agar aa saktaa to bengal ke lakhon dilon se ek hi aawaaj uthati- basu dada ek baar apni jhalak dikhalaa jaao, jate-jate hamase kuch kehete jaao
 Team India is to be selected on Friday for the T20 World Cup
 team australia main tii20 siries 3-0 se jeet kar lautne ke baad apni sarajameen par vartmaan world champion srilanka ke saath teen tii20 maichon kii siries khilne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 After losing the first four matches of the ODI series in Australia, winning in the last ODI and winning all the three T20s thereafter, has also become number one in Team India rankings
 aakhri tii20 mukaable main raina or yuvaraj kii jodi ne jis tarah jeet dilaai usase 2011 world cap quarter final kii yaad taaja ho gai
 The same pair won against Australia in that match as well
 ab jabakity20 world kapatoornament 6 march se shuru ho rahaa he
 Discussion on which faces will be in the team is necessary
 itnaa to tay he ki is team kii bagdor abhimahendra singh dhonike haathon main rahegi jabakiviraat kohliup captaini karenge
 Apart from these two, the selection of players like Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Ravichandran Ashwin is certain
 to sabhi nigahen nishchit rup se rahane par lagi hongi
 a clean sweep in the T20 series against Manish Pandey vs Ajinkya Rahane Australia may have reduced the selectors' woes but on Friday when they are picking the batsman for the number seven position in view of the Indian team's selection for the World T20 and Asia Cup Manish Pandey and Ajinkya Rahane will have to work hard to choose one
 australia main shandaar pradarshan ke baad zyaadaatar khilaadiyon ne khud ko chayan kaa daavedaar bana diya he lekin keval saatven visheshgy ballebaaj ke liye hi chayankarta pasopesh main honge
 They have to choose whether Pandey will be better than Rahane in T20 or not
 bharat ke number ek ballebaaj viraat kohli ko srilanka ke khilaaf aaraam diya gaya he jisase farm main chal rahe manish pandey ko is aagaamee gharelu siries main mauka diya gaya
 But when Kohli joins the team for the Asia Cup in Bangladesh, at least one of the 15 players selected for the Sri Lanka series will be beaten for the big tournament in march-april
 world tii20 kii team kii ghoshnaa kal honi he jabaki pandey nau farvari se pune main shuru ho rahi srilanka ke khilaaf siries main team india ke sadsy hai
 Therefore, it would be unjust to dismiss him from the team without watching his game
 rahane kii class par kisi ko koi shaq nahin he lekin chote praroopon main unki ek or do ran lene kii kshamta par dhoni ne hi sawaal uthaae hai
 He was not in the playing XI for three T20 Internationals in Australia, indicating that he was not part of the team management's plans
 yuvaraj kaa khelnaa lagbhag tayaustralia ke khilaaf tisare tii20 main yuvaraj ke antim over main dikhaae gaye karname ne team main unka sthaan sunishchit kar diya
 Yuvraj is a tall player and the selectors will not be able to ignore his performance in the 2011 World Cup when choosing the team
 tii20 siries ke baad jaisaa ki dhoni ne kaha tha ki ‘kor team’ lagbhag taiyaar he, to 15 khilaadiyon main maamuli sa hi badlaav hoga
 Another player to be kept in mind is Irfan Pathan, who led Baroda to the finals by playing well in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament
 unhen baar baar chotil hone vaale ashish nehra ke cover ke taur par rakhaa ja saktaa he
 However, the selectors did not include him for the Sri Lanka series, so the question will be whether he can be taken directly to the Asia Cup and World T20 team as Hardik Pandya has impressed the senior players in the team
 pawan negi to ravindra jadeja ke liye cover hai hin kyonki patel kii ballebaaji puri tarah se santoshjanak nahin he
 At the same time, Negi of Delhi can score long sixes in the eighth or ninth place
 isi tarah se harbhajan singh ko aswin ke cover ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he or tamilnadu kaa yah gendbaaj agar asafal rahata he tabhi unhen mauka milegaa
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar is back after recovering from injury and his 'change ups' can be impressive whenever he gets a chance

 com / icgkjx6i86 — ANI UP (@aninewsup) September 16, 2016 Mulayam met with Akhilesh When Mulayam Singh Yadav arrived in Lucknow from Delhi, it was believed that he would meet Shivpal Yadav and Akhilesh to find a way to clean up the reconciliation
 mulaayam singh ke lakhanu pahunchane par sabase pehle shivpal yadav ne unase ghar par jaakar lambii mulaakaat kii
 Mulayam did not give concrete assurances to Shivpal
 According to the assurances, Shivpal Yadav told Mulayam Singh that the way he has been taken away from the ministry has insulted him a lot and he should talk to Akhilesh and reverse this decision
 vah mulaayam singh se is baat kaa bhi thos aashwaasan chaahate the ki agar unhen party kaa pradesh adhyaksh banaaya gaya he to phir unhen apane hisaab se kaam karne kii chhot ho or akhilesh yadav tikat bantwaare samet tamaam kaamon main hastkshep nahin karen
 Meanwhile, Mulayam Singh Yadav had spoken to Akhilesh over the phone and Akhilesh had also stated clearly that he does not want to reverse his decision under any circumstances
 mulaayam singh yadavane shivpal ko koi thos aashwaasan dene ke bajaay sirf itnaa kaha ki vah maamle ko thik kar denge or vah mantri tathaa adhyaksh ke taur par kaam karte rahen
 Shivpal Yadav was not at all allowed to sit in Akhilesh's cabinet with a weak ministry
 mulaayam singh ne shivpal ko akhilesh se milane kii salaah bhi di
 Shivpal Yadav went to meet Akhilesh at the behest of the uncle-nephew and the counterparty Chief Mulayam Singh, but there was nothing worse than being made there
 akhilesh yadav ne chachaa shivpal se kaha ki wo usee amar singh kaa saath de rahe hai jo hataae gaye mukhya sachiv deepak singhl ke saath milakar unki sarkaar ke khilaaf sajeesh kar rahe the
 Stung by these allegations, Shivpal Yadav asked Akhilesh to tell him if he has any concrete evidence
 shivpal yadav ne yah bhi kaha ki koi kuch bhi kahe- faislemukhyamantrico lene hote hai
 In defense of Amar Singh, Shivpal also said that by bringing Amar Singh into the party, nobody else but Mulayam Singh Yadav himself has made the MP
 lekin chachaa bhattije kii tanatani itani badhi ki sirf 15 minute kii mulaakaat ke baad shivpal yadav baahar aa gaye or adhyaksh tathaa mantri pad se istipha dene kaa elaan kar diya
 This is the first time that Mulayam Singh Yadav is finding himself helpless in overcoming the internal tension within the party
 mana ja rahaa he ki agar ek-do din ke bheetar mulaayam singh yadav sthiti ko sambhaal paane main naakaam hote hai to vidhansabha chunaav main party ke liye mushkilen badhati jaaengi
 When Netajibat, trapped between brother and son, reached Mulayam Singh, he tried to convince Shivpal but by then Arrow had left the command
 istife kii khabar failte hi shivpal yadav ke samarthak der raat ko unke ghar ke baahar ikattha ho gaye or shivpal yadav sangharsh karo ke naare lagane lage
 Shivpal Yadav came out and told his supporters that he would go home and talk to them on Friday
 ek taraf bhai or duusari taraf bete kii tanatani ke bich mulaayam singh yadav jitne vivash dikh rahe hai, utane laachaar vah kabhi nahin dikhe
 Even if Mulayam Singh Yadav convinces Shivpal to withdraw his resignation, it is a matter of great loss to the Samajwadi Party during the election that it will be very difficult for the party to recover

 If India's democracy really wants to take advantage of the experience of many well-to-do people, then it needs a civic culture and a lawful environment (saying i am a liberal)
 yahaan chunaavon ke saath meri mulaakaat kaa zikr he, mujhe ummid he ki mere jeevankaal main yah badal jayega
 i am relieved that my parents are not alive to hear the kind of words that were used for me
 mainchunavi raajnneetimen satta yaa shakti ke liye nahin balki ek aise shahar kii seva ke liye ai jo 40 saalon se meraa ghar he, ek aisa shahar jahaan maine alag-2 padon par rahete hue seva kii he
 i have gone through many challenges - riots, protests, political violence, protection of vips and international sporting events, every experience, good and bad
 jab main aparaadh ke morche par thi to dilli par baahar se aatank kaa hamalaa hua or main usase gujri hum
 Wearing a uniform and with an echoing wireless that ordered me out on the road at any time, i yearn for a nap
 maine gramin ilaakon main mahilaon ko balaatkaar se bachaakar aparaadh khatm kiya, andheri raaton main gaanv main gashti ke liye mere saath pulicekarmi nahin hote the
 For this i patrolled the rural youth
 main swayan saptaah main 5 raat khud baahar rahati thi
 i saw traffic arrangements with thousands of students at the Asian Games, even when some of my seniors wanted to send me to Japan to take a course to show me the way out

 Another time when liquor smuggling was in full swing in a district, i eliminated liquor smuggling and rehabilitated the affected people
 
 
 
 Or sent the waste pickers to school
 
 
 
 Or open de-addiction centers from police stations that may have never been heard of before
 yah sab aaajeevan abhiyaan ban gaya tha or aage bhi bana rahegaa
 
 
 i did all this not for brag, but because the service and conditions demanded to do so
 main chunavi raajnneeti main isliye ai ki mere paas jo kuch abhi bhi tha wo main apane shahar ko dena chaahati thi
 For what Delhi needs, i wanted the city to have a stable government that works closely with the central government
 main yah bhi chaahati thi ki main is aparadhbodh ke saath naa maruun ki main hameshaa sirf tikaa-tippanee hi karti rahi or kabhi bhi chunavi raajnneeti kii pariksha dene kii himmat nahin dikhaa pai

 In such a way that challenges do not come alone in the exam clocks, a lot of other things also play an important role and each one plays

 History will keep analyzing till the end
 chunaavon ke prashn par main kahana chaahuungi ki hamen prachaar abhiyaan kii samiksha karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 The entire city or state stops in the campaign, should it happen? Roads get disorganized, work stops
 sab kuch shor bharaa ho jaataa he or kai baar ashisht, jhootha, pakshpaati, bhrasht, naakaara, saare kanoon todane vaala or galat sandesh dene vaala
 It is not a match of equality
 yah har tarah se dhan or bal kaa muqabla he
 We have to think of a solution to these, i hope that i will see this in my lifetime
 log chaahate hai ki jan-sevaaon di jaaen
 People want integrity, trust and professional dedication
 log lagu karne laayak yojanaayen chaahate hai
 But people also need in focus
 
 The more you give in focus, the more you will get
 wo nahin maanate ki zindagi main yun hi kuch nahin miltaa he
 If you snatch from one and give it to the other, it will not take much time to get snatched away

 Only God knows how long women will suffer
 aakhir main, jin logon ne mujhamen vishwaas vyakt kiya un sabko dhanyavad dena chaahuungi

 On the other hand, Shah was advising to ignore the stagnation figures of development from the FICCI platform, while half a dozen affiliates associated with the economic issues of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh were busy planning a rally against the government's economic policies
 modi sarkaar aarthik morche par desh bhar kii aalochanaon kii jad main he

 Ministers and party leaders did not tire of demonetisation and the 'benefits' of GST

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself told it from the Red Fort on Independence Day
 lekin rigerv bank ne bank main jamaa puraane noton kii sankhya bataakar maano hakeekat ko ujagar kar diya
 However, there were reports earlier on how many jobs have been lost due to this and how big a blow to business, especially the informal sector
 isse pehle ki notebandi kaa asar khatm hota jiesti ne halaat or bigaad diya
 BJP leaders also realized this and as if the situation suddenly changed
 mantriyon ke chehre murjhaa gaye, daawey se parhez kiya jane laga or bhaajapa ko maananaa padaa ki siyaasi lihaaj se sthiti pratikul ho rahi he
 As a result, a meeting of the National Working Committee to be held on 25 September in Delhi has called all the mps, mlas and even the members of the State Legislative Council for the first time in the history of the party
 rashtriya kaarysmiti main sabase adhik focus aarthik prastaav par rahegaa
 Figures have been sought from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Petroleum and Agriculture
 prastaav vitt mantri arun jetali kii dekharekh main taiyaar ho rahaa he
 After this, BJP President Shah will discuss with Prime Minister Modi and finalize the economic proposal
 bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaarysmiti kii yah baithak pehle andhra pradesh main hone vaali thi
 It was formally announced in Bhubaneswar (odisha) in May this year
 kaarysmiti ke liye vishakhapatnam yaa vijaywada kaa naam sujhaayaa gaya tha
 But, it was suddenly decided last month that the working committee would be held in Delhi
 sutron kaa kahana he ki pichley kuch maheenon main modi sarkaar kii aarthik nitiyaan jis bade paimaane par desh bhar main aalochana kii jad main ai hai, usne bhaajapa kii chintaa badha di he
 This year there are assembly elections in three states including Gujarat
 agle saal madhya pradesh, rajasthan jaise pramukh rajyon ke chunaav hai
 There are only one and a half years left in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 aise main sirf kaarysmiti se kaam nahin chalegaa
 Only three-and-a-half hundred party officials attend such meetings
 isliye kaarysmiti ke bahaane hi sabhi janpratinidhiyon ko aarthik sthiti se avgat karaane kii yojana bani
 Soon the National Executive Council was convened in Delhi instead of Andhra Pradesh
 petrol-dijal ke badhate daam, ghatata audyogic utpaadan, jidipi kii giravat, notebandi or jiesti kii sandigdh safalataa par sawaal har ore se uth rahe hai
 The concrete answer to these questions is neither with the BJP mps, nor with the mlas, nor with the members of the Legislative Council
 upar se modi sarkaar ke mantri apane ool-jalul bayanon se aalochakon ko or mauka uplabdh kara rahe hai
 When the general secretary sitting in the BJP headquarters calls the workers to hold conference, seminar, discussion, and urges them to declare the achievement of the Modi government, the activists are being asked to defend the Modi government on the economic front
 paricharchaa main jane vaale party padaadhikari bhi mahasachivon se phone kar kuch aise tathy bataane kaa aagrah kar rahe hai jis aadhaar par apni sarkaar kaa bachaav kiya ja sake
 In the discussion on the economic issue, it has been reached so much that the party officials have also started ridiculing each other on the same issue
 misaal ke taur par, mahangaai dian main maarane kaa totaka koun taiyaar karegaa? media main charchit hone ke liye koun mantri ool-julul bayaan dene kii qatari main hai aadi kii charchaa bhaajapa padaadhikari ek duusare se kar rahe hai
 On social media too, BJP is seen on the backfoot on economic issues
 is plateform par sarkaar kii ho rahi khinchaai se party main chintaa he
 BJP workers are also able to respond to the opponents on social media or TV talk shows, public forums or street-nooks
 notebandi ke dauraan jis yakeen ke saath taal thok kar vipaksh ko dhul chataa rahe the ab usee mudde par uthne vaale sawaal se bachane kii naubat aa gai he
 In an informal conversation, BJP mps and mlas openly admit that it is difficult to satisfy the people of the region by answering them on the economic issue
 yah ek aisi kadavi sachaai he jo modi sarkaar kii chhavi ko kharaab kar rahi he
 Economic matters are such that it has a wide impact on every section of the society
 gruhinee, vyapaaree, kisaan, majdoor, chaatr or madhyam varg sabhi jagah yah charchaa he ki mahangaai kii raftaar baaki chizon se kahin zyada he
 a BJP general secretary says that the National Working Committee has called all mps, mlas and members of the Legislative Council to listen to the Prime Minister's speech at the event
 pradhanmantri par logon kaa bharosa barkaraar he
 In such a situation, people will trust whatever measures will be given by them to stop inflation
 modi ke bhaashan ke alok main jo aarthik prastaav paas kiye jaaenge, vah ek aisa document hoga jo mahangaai, notebandi, jiesti se jude tikhe se tikhe sawaalon ke uttar dene vaale honge
 Party officials are also outraged over the economic proposal and they are not doing so poorly
 maamla gambhir isliye he kyonki aarthik nitiyon par virodhiyon se adhik apano—rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke aanushanbik sanghathanon—ne is kadar morcha kholaa he ki bhaajapa netaaon ke chehron par havaaiyaan udaye lagi hai
 It is believed that the Sangh workers have more interaction with the common people and they understand their feelings better
 isi vajah se bhaajapa main unki salaah ko tarjeeh di jaati he
 For the BJP, the situation is exactly like the proverbial nemesis from above
 idhar, bhaajapa ke log aarthik morche par ho rahi aalochana se nikalne kii jugat main jute hai to udhar aresas ke aarthik prakoshth se jude aadha darjan sanghathanon ne modi sarkaar par majdoor virdohi hone kaa aarope lagaate hue 17 november ko 5 lakh logon kii raily nikaalane kaa elaan kar diya he
 These organizations have expressed disappointment to the Modi government on the economic front
 aisi hi raily dattopant thengdi ke netritv vaale bhartiya majdoor sangh (bmes) ne vaajapeyi sarkaar (endie-1) ke khilaaf bhi nikaali thi
 The Vajpayee government did not pay heed to the rally and the BJP had to bear the brunt
 khaas baat yah he ki bmes kii 11 se 13 agast ke bich ranchi main hui rashtriya kaaryakarini kii jis baithak main modi sarkaar ke khilaaf 5 lakh logon kii raily nikaalane kaa nirnay hua, us baithak main sangh ke sah sarkarywah dattatreya hosbale bhi maujuud the
 Hosabale is also the patron of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh
 matlab is raily ko lekar sangh bhi sahamat he
 All half a dozen organizations associated with the economic cell of the union will take out a big rally at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan under the banner of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, Laghu Udyog Bharti, Swadeshi Jagran Manch, Customer Panchayat and Sahakar Bharti
 raily kii akramakata kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki isko lekar bmes congress, vampanthi dalon se jude majdoor sanghathanon ko bhi raily main aamantrit karne par vichaar kar rahaa he
 People associated with BMS say that whatever organizations are working for the interests of the workers and want to join the rally, they are welcome
 bmes ke mahasachiv birjesh upaadhyaay kehete hai, ''2014 ke chunaav main mazdooron ne bhi bhaajapa ko samarthan diya tha
 About 50 crore laborers were hopeful that the Modi government would remove the anomalies in the labor sector that had been going on for the last 70 years
 lekin majdoor sarkaar kii praathamikta main nahin he, yah sabit ho gaya he
 We are holding a rally because the status of the workers was yet to demand, but through the rally, we can become the commander of the government instead of seeking it from the government
 ''in sanghathanon se jude logon kaa kahana he ki pichhali may main jab hamaari maangon or samasyaon par gaur kiye bina bhaajapa ne naaraa gadhia shuru kiya ki saath he, vishwaas he, ho rahaa vikaas he to hamane raily kii yojana taiyaar kii
 50 crore laborers are without accompanying
 
 
 jaise naare kaa koi matlab nahin he
 So far 93 percent of the 50 crore laborers are in the unorganized sector
 sirf 7 fisadi sangathit kshetra main hai
 Of these 7 per cent, 67 per cent are on contract, not regular
 in sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki contract lebar regulation and abolishan act 1970 main bana
 According to the rule, work of permanent nature cannot be given to people with contracts
 lekin sarkaar khud hi iskaa ulanghan kar rahi he

 ab is baat ke puure asaar hai ki jharkhand main maharashtra ke saath hi sitambar-aktubar main vidhansabha chunaav ho sakate hai
 In the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Chidambaram assured that elections would be held in the state immediately after the monsoon and with this, it was also approved to extend the President's rule in the state for the next six months
 sarkaar gathan kii sambhaavna kshinvartmaan main, 81 sadasyeey jharkhand vidhansabha main 9 sadsy kam hai jabaki kai anya vidhayak vidhansabha ke adhyaksh kii ayogyata sambandhi kaarywahi kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 In other words, the announcement of the Union Home Minister puts an end to the demand of JMM and independents to form a new government in the state
 rajya main jo bhi sarkaar banane ke icchhuk the ve inhen nirdaleeyon se samarthan lene ko taiyaar the
 After this assurance, there is no possibility of government formation in the state
 chunaav kii tarikhon kaa intjaarchidambaram ne is ghoshnaa ke saath is masale par congress kaa rukh bhi saaf kar diya he
 Chidambaram said in Parliament, "I will request the Election Commission to fix the date of assembly elections in Jharkhand soon after passing the resolution to extend the President's rule in the state for another six months
" ''congress ko chhavi bigadane kaa bhayjaahir he congress netritv pratyaksh rup se rajya main kisi vaikalpik sarkaar kaa samarthan karne kaa anicchhuk tha or aisa bilawajeh nahin tha
 However, many state Congress mlas were also ready to seek the support of the five independent mlas stranded in the disproportionate assets case to taste power
 lekin party ke kendriya netritv ko yah vichaar pasand nahin tha or use laga ki isse party kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahonchega
 President's rule has been in force since January 19 when he was forced to quit as Chief Minister due to the defeat of Shibu Soren in the by-election for the Tamar assembly seat, leading to political instability in the state
 is par 19 janvari ko raashtrapati shashan lagu kar diya gaya
 Soren was leading the jmm-led UPA coalition
 unke istife ke baad upie main unke uttaradhikari ko lekar koi sahmati nahin ban pai thi
 In the 81-member Assembly of Jharkhand (after the Lok Sabha elections, whose strength now stands at 73), the JMM has 17, the Congress 9, the RJD 7
 rajya main sarkaar banane ke liye 37 vidhayakon kaa samarthan hona jaruri he
 Mundavo said against the President's rule
 In the Lok Sabha debate, the NDA has cleared the situation regarding its leadership in Jharkhand as the party fielded Arjun Munda to speak out against the President's rule in the state
 munda is maukey par khadey hue or unhone raashtrapati shashan ke khilaaf jamkar bolaa
 He said it is difficult to trust the Center as the Center broke its promise to hold elections by extending the period of President's rule in Goa's case
 pradesh main kanoon-vyavastha dhwastamunda ne kaha, ''yahaan shaq kii vajah maujuud he, rajya main raashtrapati shashan kii avadhi badhanaa raajnneeti se prerit he
 We want immediate announcement of assembly elections in the state
 in chah maheenon main kya hua he, yah sabko pataa he
 Law and order has completely collapsed during the President's rule and development has also fallen flat
 '' unhone aarope lagaaya ki rajya ke rajyapal said sibte raji ke iraade bhi rajya ke hit main nahin hai
 Arjun Munda, the former Chief Minister of the state and the largest tribal leader of the BJP in the state, will lead the party in the state in the upcoming assembly elections and Munda hopes that the party will get a majority
 loksabhaa chunaav main munda ke netritv main party kii rajya kii 14 main se 8 siton par jeet se party kaaryakarta kaaphi utsahit hai
 Like the BJP, other political parties in the state have intensified the enthusiasts in view of the elections
 nirdaleey vidhayakon par nirbharta khataranakmaujuuda vidhansabha main, nirdaleey vidhayak aksar sarkaar ko banane or giraane kaa khel khelte aae hai kyonki rajya ke mukhyamantri ko hameshaa hi bahut kam antaraal vaale bahumat ke saath talwaar kii dhar par chalanaa padataa tha, or yah samarthan nirdaleeyon se hi miltaa tha
 Partiality and discrimination confounded the general public and the public was completely ignored
 ab jharkhand main vidhansabha chunaav kabhi bhi ho sakate hai, or aisi ummid jataai ja rahi he ki jharkhand ke matadaata is baar rajya main trishanku vidhansabha nahin banaaenge or nirdaleeyon ke haath main saudebaaji kii kisi tarah kii koi takat nahin rahegi
 Politics filled with uncertainties It must be remembered that politics is full of uncertainties because in the political landscape of Jharkhand, there are many regional satraps like Sudesh Mahato and Babulal Marandi who have a lot of hold
 aise main yah koi mushkil nahin ki itihaas swany ko doharaa le
 Of course, the voters of the state want to avoid such possibilities
 jharkhand kii raajnneeti ke bare main kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 If you are in Jharkhand, patience is a very useful thing here

 Currently, his son Amit Jogi is a Congress MLA from Marwahi Legislative Assembly seat
 jabaki jogi ne pehle kaha tha ki wo chunaav nahin ladegein

 There is a conflict between student organizations and university administration

 Earlier in August, students protests were held in Himachal Pradesh for banning students' union

 The buzz of police action reached Delhi and other student organizations including Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU) demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Human Resource Development

 On January, 1997, during the student union at BHU campus, there was a massive breakdown and arson

 The university then banned the student union election
 2007 main chaatr parishad kii vyavastha lagu hui, jisamen chaatro kii ore se nirvaachit pratinidhi parishad kaa sachiv hota he or adhyaksh vishvavidhyalay kii ore se namit professor hote hai
 In 2012, the students took a stay order from the court that the chairman and vice-chairman are professors and students are not represented

 But the very next day this struggle turned into a mutual fight between the students

 In the last 7-8 years, BHU has been facing punishment for mutual factionalization of administrative officials
 ve apana varchasv kaayam karne ke liye na sirf aapas main bhidate hai balki chaatro ko bhi bhadakaate hai
 Prior to the recent fiasco, the university administration had claimed to know the opinion of the students through a survey, stating that about 90 per cent of the students had expressed their opinion against the restoration of the students union
 ol india students association kii biechayu sachiv shikha singh sawaal karti hai, ''prashasan ne is survey kaa puraa khulaasa kyon nahin kiya
 He had already given his verdict in it that the campus environment could deteriorate due to the student union elections
 ''2007 main mukhyamantri banate hi bispi pramukh mayawati ne rajya sarkaar ke adheen aane vaale vishvavidhyalayon main chaatr sangh chunaav pratibandhit kar diya tha

 siyaasi galiyaaron main paswan ko raajnneeti kaa mausam vaigyanik mana bhi jaataa he
 Seeing Paswan's frost, the number of those who could guess the upcoming government is not less
 aaj tak se khaas baatcheet karte hue paswan ne kaha ki mujhe to sabhi mausam vaigyanik kehete hai
 We had already said three years ago that the Nitish government will continue in Bihar and Modi will form the government again in 2019
 agsit pole ke nattejey to aa hi gaye hai, bas ab loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey bhi aa jaaen
 Describing the exit poll figures as real, he clearly said that the exit poll figures have not come out from evms, have they? yah to janata or votaron se baatcheet par aadhaarit hai
 How not to believe in them
 unhone kaha ki is baar ke chunaav main agar koi mudda tha to sirf modi kaa naam or modi kaa kaam
 The public is winning the NDA with a strong majority
 narendra modi duusari baar pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lenge
 On the question of becoming a minister in the new government, Paswan said that it is the prerogative of the Prime Minister, but i wish that the lamp should be carried forward from the quota of the party
 unhone yah bhi joda ki party ke sansadeey dal kaa adhyaksh banaae jane ke baad yah tay bhi chiraag ko hi karnaa he
 By the way, we are eagerly waiting for the election results to clear the picture of the new government
 iviem par sawaal uthaane waalon par tanj karte hue paswan ne kaha ki chunaav ayog koi sarkaar kaa hissaa thode hi he
 He is free

 Those who have broken the evms of defeat should just excuse
 yahi bahaanaa vipaksh ko iviem main mil gaya he
 Without naming, he warned his former Rashtriya Lok Samata Party President Upendra Kushwaha that he said that those who are talking about the bloodshed on the streets after the results, they should say that our workers have bangles Is not worn samaaj virdohi takaton ko ham dhul chataa denge
 Inspired by self-confidence, Paswan said that now only development and work will be done
 mail today ke skill and entrprenyorship summit 2017 main bhaag lene aae chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh aae
 He spoke openly to Aaj Tak correspondent Jitendra Bahadur Singh on the Naxal problem
 unhone kaha ki, note bandi se naksali barbaad hue hai
 At the same time, he also said that Naxalites are bringing arms and ammunition from abroad
 sawaal-jawaab main padhein kya kaha raman singh ne
 Question: In order to completely oust the Naxalites from Chhattisgarh, how are you benefiting from the operation that you are running Operation Prahar 1 and Prahar 2? Raman Singh's answer: We have started work in two directions
 ek behatar deveopment kii niti hamane apana rakhi he or uske liye bada infrastracchar chhattisgarh ke alag-alag jilon main khadaa kiya ja rahaa he
 Roads are being built on a large scale in the state
 chhattisgarh ke jo log hai uske liye chhattisgarh sarkaar ne puri tareeke se kaam kiya he
 At the same time, major works of skill development are also being done by the government for the youth
 dhire-dhire deveopment ke saath puri tareeke se vahaan ke jo aam log hai vah jud rahe hai or iskaa phayda yah ho rahaa he ki vah duusari disha main ja rahe hai
 The Government of Chhattisgarh has given a better surrender policy
 chhattisgarh sarkaar chaahati he ki naksali jo hai vah shanti or vikaas ke raste main aaen
 When needed after this, inter-state campaigns are conducted, in which the Naxalites are heaped, and during this time if the Naxalites want to surrender, then they are given the chance to surrender
 sawalapane kaha he ki 2022 tak chhattisgarh se puri tareeke se naksalwad khatm kar diya jayega
 What steps are the Chhattisgarh government taking for this? Answer: Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh said that as the feeling of safety comes in the state, roads are constructed
 vikaas kaa kaam hota he
 This leads to a complete eradication of the Naxal problem
 yah kaam lagaataar chhattisgarh sarkaar kii taraf se kiya ja rahaa he
 Bastar of Chhattisgarh is the only district in India where a landmine bursts during the construction of roads, bullets run
 Construction of a road in Sukma district i
e
 10 km when the Chhattisgarh government constructed 12 soldiers were killed in it
 
 hamaare javaanon kii sadak nirmaan main shahadat hoti he par hamaare jawan katibaddh hai kii sadakon ke nirmaan kaary karke hi rahanaa he
 Question: Now information is coming about the way that Naxalites have fled from Bastar and Dandakaranya areas
 kyonki vahaan par bade-bade oparation chalaae ja rahe hai
 But a new TRAI junction is coming up in the districts of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra areas where Naxalites are staying
 ye kitni badi chunauti he?javabahamaara puraa prayaas he ki maharashtra, madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh kii sarkaar milakar jo nai jagahon par naksali ekajute hone kii koshish kar rahe hai unke khilaaf oparation chalaae
 However, due to the operation that has been done in the areas of Bastar and Dandakaranya, the men are running away from the tail
 phir bhi duusari jagahon par agar tikne kii koshish karte hai to unke khilaaf rajyon ke saath milakar oparation karenge
 Question: How do the Naxalites get funding? haalanki, notebandi ke baad centre sarkaar ne report di thi ki naksali puri tareeke se barbaad ho gaye, lekin kya in naksaliyon ko videshon se bhi funding hoti he? is par aapke paas kya jaankaree he
 Answer: Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh said that the information we have about the funding is local funding
 isamen tendu pattey ke jariye funding hoti he
 Collects funding from contractors
 transporter se dabaav banaakar funding lete hai
 But the arms and ammo that the Naxalites have comes from abroad
 iske liye jo paisa he, vah local hi ugaate hai
 Let's use it
 notebandi ke baad jo paisa inke paas tha vah jameen main gaadkar rakhte the
 He was completely ruined and much difference has been made on the Naxal problem

 BJP and Congress leaders are face to face on Manoj Tiwari's viral video
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke viral video ke mudde ko lekar aam aadmi party ne chautarafa gherne kii koshish kii
 This video is going viral on social media, the Aam Aadmi Party is also not in a mood to leave this issue

 Manoj Tiwari is currently on a tour of Punjab and after getting the video on social media, he has recorded a video from his mobile in the car itself and said that he is in discussion nowadays for many reasons and now Aam Aadmi Party has one of his videos
 Saying that he has mocked the people engaged in the line after demonetisation, while he had recited poetry to encourage people
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal dilli ke vikaas se jude muddon par bahes karne ke bajaae bevajaah kii baton ko lekar vivaad paidaa karte rahete hai
 He alleged that Kejriwal is not able to provide convenience to the people of Delhi and he himself has come after spending nights in a slum where people are in a bad condition

 As the festival of Rakhi draws closer, the markets of the capital are decorated with the Rakhis
 chote-bade bazaaron main har tarah kii rang-birangi rakhiyaan logon ko lubhaa rahi hai, par is baar kaa tyohaar khaas he, kyonki is baar chini raakhiyon kii apeksha bhartiya raakhiyon kii dhooma he
 For the past few years, Chinese ash has been the center of attraction in the markets
 pokamon, chota bhim jaise cartoon kairactors vaali electronic rakhiyaan bacchon kii pehali pasand hua karti thim
 But these days, due to the environment of boycott of Chinese goods in India, the Chinese market has also cooled down
 kharidaar jahaan stone se saje dori vaali bhartiya rakhiyaan lenaa zyada pasand kar rahe hai, vahiin dukandaar bhi chini raakhiyon kaa maal nahi le rahe hai

 Like other goods, along with wholesale shopping of rakhis, the retail market here is quite famous and even Chinese ashis are being sold here
 dukandaaron kaa kahana he ki kharidaar hi jab nahi hai, to chini saamaan ham rakh kar bhi kya karen
 However, Chinese ash has reached the markets at least as often as this time
 par khaas baat yah he ki log ab inhen kharidne se parhez kar rahe hai
 After the dispute between India and China over Bhutan's Doklam, there is an atmosphere against China across the country and people are opposing the goods made in China

 a shocking revelation has been revealed in the gang rape case involving a student returning from coaching on the night of November 1 in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh
 is maamle main ek aisi chook saamne ai he, jise sunakar har koi hairaan he
 It was written in the first medical report of the victim girl that physical relations were made with the girl's will
 is vaardaat ke baad report darj karaane ke liye ek thane se duusare thane bhatkar rahi peedita or uske parijanon kii tamaam koshishon ke baad jab medical jaanch hui bhi to aisi jisase rape kii pushti tak nahin ho sakati thi
 It clearly stated that the victim first made a physical relationship with consent, later two people did it forcibly
 us vakt logon kaa mizaaj dekhakar is report ko dabaa liya gaya, kyonki yadi saamne aati to bavaal hone kii sambhaavna thi
 After this, a second medical report was prepared in a hurry
 iske aadhaar par baad main police ne cese darj kiya
 After this, the arrest of the accused was shown
 abhi haal hi main chauthe aaropee ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Deputy Inspector General of Police Sudhir Lad, the head of the SIT, who was set up to investigate the incident, had said that the fourth accused in the gangrape, Ramesh Mehra alias Raju, has also been arrested by the police
 use bhopal shahar ke kolar road sthit salaiya ilaake se giraftaar kiya gaya
 With this, the four accused in this case were arrested by the police

 The Madhya Pradesh government had suspended five police officers, including three in-charge of the police station, for negligence in registering the FIR for the gangrape with this student
 aropiyon ke liye faansee kii sajoudhar, gangrape peedita ne aropiyon ko chauraahey par faansee kii sajaa dene kii maang kii he
 He says that the attitude of the police is not right
 rajdhani ke habibganj kshetra main peedita ek november kii raat ko koching se laut rahi thi, tabhi uske saath chaar yuvakon ne gangrape kiya
 When the victim went to the police station, she was banished to another police station

 Even worse was the attitude of the police, which kept them from one station to another

 ' uttar pradesh ke gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav main dilachasp mode aa gaya he
 To defeat the BJP, the SP and the BSP have forgotten the 23-year-old rivalry and forged an alliance
 vahiin bijepi ne is seat ko bachaane ke liye puri takat jhonk di he
 If you look at the bjp's political equation of the by-elections in both seats of the state, the party is looking heavily at the alliance of akhilesh-mayawati
 phulpur: sapa-basapa milakar bijepi se kambijapi pehali baar modi lahar main 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main phulpur seat par apni jeet kaa paracham lahraane main kaamyaab hui thi
 Keshav Prasad Maurya became MP from Phulpur seat in 2014 as BJP candidate, but resigned from UP after becoming Deputy CM of UP in March 2017
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke mili maton ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to kul 9 lakh 60 hajaar 341 maton main se bijepi ke keshav maury ko 5 lakh 3 hajaar 564 vot mili the
 SP candidate Dharam Singh Patel got 1 lakh 95 thousand 256 votes, BSP candidate Kapilmuni Karwaria got 1 lakh 63 thousand 710 and Congress's Mo
 caff ko 58 hajaar 127 mat mili the
 BJP got 52 per cent votes here, while SP and BSP got 47 per cent votes
 aise main sapa-basapa hi nahin balki virodh main pade sabhi maton ko mila den to bhi wo bijepi ko mili vot ke mukaable kam tha
 Looking at the same record, it can be said that if votes like 2014 are held then SP candidate Nagendra Patel cannot be assured of victory even after the support of BSP
 gorakhpur: sapa, basapa se zyada bijepigorakhpur bijepi kaa majboot durg mana jaataa he
 The BJP has held this seat since 1989
 yogi adityanath ne pichley paanch baar se saansad rahane ke baad pichley saal upi ke siem banane ke baad yahaan kii loksabhaa sadsyta se istipha de diya tha
 SP and BSP have joined hands to snatch Gorakhpur seat from BJP
 iske baavjood vipakshiyon ke liye ye aasaan nahin rahane vaala
 Please tell that Yogi Adityanath got 5 lakh 39 thousand 127 votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 sapa ummidavaar rajmati nishad ko 2 lakh 26 hajaar 344 vot mili, vahiin basapa pratyaashee ram bhual nishad ko 1 lakh 76 hajaar 412 vot mili the
 Apart from this, the Congress got only 45 thousand 719 votes
 is tarah sapa or basapa ke saath-saath congress ke vot ko mila den to 4 lakh 48 hajaar 475 vot hote hai
 Which is 90 thousand 652 votes less than BJP
 gorakhpur seat se yogi kii viraasat seat se utre bijepi ummidavaar upendra shukla ko maat dene ke liye sapa pratyaashee praveen nishad ko bispi ne samarthan kiya he
 Now we have to see how the SP BSP together compensates the previous vote Yogi got

 maharashtra vidhansabha main bijepi ne dhvanimat se vishwaas hasil karne kaa daawa kiya he
 The newly elected speaker preferred voice vote over ballot vote
 party ne iskaa phayda uthaate hue vishwasamat hasil kar liya
 But this raised many questions
 fadanvis ke 'vishwaas' par ungaliib ham bataate hai wo das vajahen, jinase is vishwasamat par avishvaas ho rahaa he
 
 
 1
 sabase pehle to spikar ko bailat kii bajaay dhvanimat kaa sahaara lene kaa adhikaar nahin hona chahie, kyonki yah ek nai sarkaar ke vishwaas kaa maamla tha
 Usually such a provision is in passing the bill, etc
, but while gaining confidence let the speaker take recourse to voice, this has rarely been heard
 2
 The biggest thing in voicemail is that it is very difficult to find out how many people are in favor and how many are in opposition
 vahaan bhi vidhansabha main shor-sharaaba ho rahaa tha
 In such a situation, it would not be appropriate to just listen to the voice of the mlas and say that there are more members in favor of the particular
 3
 The party is also accepting that the BJP does not have a majority and does not have 144 mlas with the party
 anek prayaason ke baad vah 137 kaa aankada paar nahin kar pai he
 In such a situation, to say that he has a majority would be wrong
 4
 Even if the NCP members who were supporting BJP from outside would walk out, it would have become a matter
 ve bhi vahaan baithe hue the
 Did they keep silence on it? 5
 agar spikar ko dhvanimat kaa hi sahaara lenaa tha, to unhone paksh or vipaksh main bantwaaraa kyon nahin karavaaya? isse sthiti spasht ho jaati ki kitne sadsy saath hai or kitne nahin
 6
 vishwaas prastaav rakhane main itani jaldbaaji kii gai ki kisi ko sochane kaa mauka hi nahin mili
 The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly has this right, but it is necessary to think about how it is morally appropriate to do so
 7
 Why did the speaker not give the post of Leader of Opposition to the Shiv Sena MLA Eknath Shinde before the trust vote? Making him the leader of the opposition soon after getting the confidence vote deepens the suspicion that something was going on in his mind
 8
 Though the NCP had announced outside the House that the party would support the BJP, it did nothing in the House and did not even duly inform the Speaker
 9
 The speaker made the motion of confidence immediately as soon as his election took place and that too was just one line, it was also strange
 itani jaldi or hadabadi main unhone yah kiya ki duusari party ke netaa samaj bhi nahin paae
 10
 is puure episod main sirf raajnneeti dikhaai detii he
 Why was the passage of the trust vote announced so hastily that no one knew anything
 naitikta kii drushti se yah uchit nahin dikhataa
 Overall, this faith looks more like a juggling than a proposition
 iran kii basij milicia ke pramukh ne somvaar ko america raashtrapati donald trump kii dhamkiyon ko 'manovaigyanik yuddh' bataakar khaarij kar diya
 According to the semi-official news agency ISNA, General Ghulam Hussain Gayapur said, Trump's statement against Iran is a psychological war
 vah iran ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii sthiti main nahin hai
 He wrote these comments at a time when he was attacked on Twitter on Sunday, never threaten America again or you will have to face the consequences like some have suffered in history
 iran ko trump kii chetavanee- dobaaraa america ko mat dhamkaana, varna
 
 
 
 isse pehle iran ke raashtrapati hasan ruhani ne trump ko 'sher kii poonch se nahin khilne' kii naseehat dete hue kaha tha ki iran ke saath sangharsh 'ab tak kaa sabase bada yuddh' hoga
 As reported by the news agency Effe, at a ceremony of Iranian diplomats, Rouhani said that his country does not want to start hostilities with the US, but will not hesitate to go to war
 trump ne ruhani ko ravivaar der raat twit kar kaha, 'iran ke raashtrapati ruhani ke liye : america ko ab kabhi dobaaraa dhamkaana nahin, nahin to aapako aise parinaam bhugatne honge, jo itihaas main kabhi kisi ne kabhi nahin bhugta hoga
 We are no longer the country that listens to your hateful words of violence and death
 isliye sachet rahen
 'to Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE
 WE ARE NO LONGER a COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH
 BE CAUTIOUS! - Donald J
 Trump (@realdonaldtrump)july 23, 2018bataa den ki ruhani ne kaha tha ki america ke saath kaamkaaj kaa arth aatmasamarpan karnaa or iran kii uplabdhiyon ko khatm karnaa nahin he
 According to the website of Iran Presidency, Rouhani said that Iran's enemies must understand that war with Iran will be the deadliest war (mother of All Wars) and peace with Iran will be the best peace (mother of All Peace)

 modi ke naam par chunavi naiya paar karne main juty dilli bijepi ko do-do jatke lage hai
 First Modi's rally in Ramlila Maidan was canceled, after this, Modi's 3D rally was expected, but at the same time this rally in nine places of Delhi could not be held
 ab aakhri do dinon ke prachaar main ummidavaaron ke paas sirf modi ke naam kaa hi sahaara he
 Modi photos, Modi videos
 bijepi ke prachaar main sabakuch modimay he
 But when it actually came to Modi's rally in Delhi, Modi did not come
 ramlila maidan main hone vaali raily radd ho gai
 But Delhi BJP president and candidate from Chandni Chowk, Harsh Vardhan claims that what happened if Modi did not come, Modi's name is enough
 dow harshavardhan ne kaha, dilli waalon ke dil main based hai, modi ji
 It doesn't matter whether they come now or not
 dilliwaale tay kar chuke hai ki vot modi ji ko hi padegaa
 Modi claimed to be settled in the heart, but on Monday evening there was another setback
 jab modi kii bahuprachaarit thri-di raily bhi radd ho gai
 In this rally, Modi wanted to make a live appeal to voters to win BJP candidates through satellite link
 ab ektual or virtual donon modi nahin aae, tab bhi ummid to modi hi hai
 That is why BJP has released a video for Muslim-majority areas of Delhi
 is film ke jariye bijepi modi or muslim votaron ke bich kii duuri kam karnaa chaahati he
 It is being shown in different places as a promotion
 loksabhaa chunaav ke prachaar main bijepi modi ke alaava koi or baat nahin karnaa chaahati
 Because both the party and the candidate are aware that the issues will not cross the electoral stage this time
 dilli main vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ek bada jhatka kha chuki he
 The issues that he should have as an opposition have already been defeated by the Aam Aadmi Party
 aise main party ke paas jeet ke liye sirf modi kaa naam hi sahaara he

 hurriyat conference ke narampanthi dhade ne kashmir par centre sarkaar kii taaja pahal ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki yah niraashajanak he kyonki isamen rajya ke logon kii mahatvakanksha ko puraa karne kii raajnneetik ichhashakti kii kami jhalkati he
 a spokesman for the faction headed by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said the Centre's move was an attempt to provide relief to the crisis-ridden state's Omar Abdullah government
 pravaktaa ne kaha ki sarvadaleey pratinidhimandal ne rajya kii apni haal kii yatra ke dauraan sthiti kii gambhirtha kaa akalan kiya tha lekin iske baavjood aath sutri formule main mukhya mudde ko samajhane or us par dhyaan dene kii ichhashakti kii kami jhalkati he jo niraashajanak he
 It is noteworthy that earlier the hardline faction of Hurriyat Conference headed by Syed Ali Shah Geelani rejected this package of the Center and termed it as just a 'fraud'
 pravaktaa ne kaha ki kashmir main shanti or sthirataa keval kashmir mudde ke samaadhaan se hi aa sakati he or raajnneetik tathaa aarthik riyaayaton se nahin
 He said, 'this (package) once again shows New Delhi's disinterest in paying attention to the political ambitions of the people of the state for which they have been agitating for the last six decades
 ’mirwij ne kashmir mudde par sweekaarya hal tak pahunchane ke liye ek baar phir pakistan ko shaamil karne kii vakaalat kii he
 The spokesman said, 'we have made some suggestions to the government for initiating a meaningful process of partnership between the people of Kashmir, India and Pakistan, concerned parties to resolve the Kashmir issue
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘janata ko vishwaas ke aadhaar par raahat pradaan karne ke liye suzav jaruri hai
 But we are disappointed that no progress has been made in this regard
 ’mirwij ne jataayaa ki unhen lagata he ki kashmir package kaa makasad ‘vaastavik’ mudde se dhyaan hataanaa he
 The detained Mirwaiz interacted with office bearers of his organization through teleconferencing, which led to the reaction of the moderate faction

 iraq main 39 bhartiya varsh 2014 se laapata hai

 india today network ne in 39 bharatiyon kii talash main shuru kii gai apni swatantra jaanch kaa dayera iraq se lekar syria ke yudhgrast kshetron tak badha diya he
 Three months ago, India Today Network arrived in the Badush prison in Mosul city, Iraq
 mana jaataa tha ki aatanki sanghathan ISIS ne agava kiye gaye39 bharatiyon ko yaheen bandhak bana kar rakhaa tha
 India Today saw that there was nothing left but the debris in the jail place
 vahaan to kya aasapaas bhi kahin inasaanon ke rahane kii koi sambhaavna nahin dikhi
 Following this shocking revelation from India Today, India and Iraq stepped up efforts to locate 39 Indians at the government level
 isko lekar vipaksh ne bhi modi sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa tha or maamle main sushamaa swaraj ko sansad main safai deni padi thi
 This week, Minister of State for External Affairs General (retd) VK Sinhalapata arrived in Baghdad as part of a mission to find Indians
 singh apane saath laapata bharatiyon ke kuch rishtedaaron ke diene semple bhi apane saath baghdad le gaye hai
 In Baghdad, Singh told India Today that more samples are being collected for possible identification
 singh ne kaha, ‘iraqi sarkaar ne apni jaanch or records ke liye diene namoonay maange hai
 They are needed for the identification process
 ’ is bich india today ke reporters apni swatantra jaanch ke tahat is samooche ashaant kshetra main jagah-jagah ja kar laapata 39 bharatiyon kaa suraag dhundne main jute hai
 For this, war is being moved from one city devastated in Iraq to another
 yahi nahin swatantra jaanch kaa yah dayera yuddh kii vibheeshikaa main tabah ho chuke syria tak failaa he
 Let us tell you that the influence of ISIS has now remained only in some cities of Syria bordering Iraq
 damishq main syria shashan kii taraf se bataaya gaya ki unke paas 2014 ke madhya main iraq se agava kiye gaye bharatiyon ke bare main koi soochna nahin he
 Syrian President Bashar al-assad's advisor Dr Bauthana Shaban said, 'I have no information
 agar unhen mosul se agava kiya gaya tha, to iraqi sarkaar ko is bare main kuch pataa hoga
 If they had been brought (to Syria) on behalf of ISIS, they would have been taken to Raqqa, not to us, not to Syria
 ’india today reporter ne syria ke tabah ho chuke kasbon, khandhar ban chuke imaaraton ke dhaanchon se hote hue aleppo shahar kaa rukh kiya
 Aleppo was once considered the business capital of Syria
 reporter kii koshish yahi rahi ki kahin se bhi 39 laapata bharatiyon ke bare main koi suraag mil jaae
 Soldiers were talked to in Aleppo

 District and Sessions Judge GP Mittal heard the arguments of the CBI counsel and Sajjan Kumar, co-accused in the case, Khushal Singh, and reserved their verdict
 maamle main jirah ke dauraan khushhaal ke vakil wike malik ne kaha ki ek aisi adaalat main maamla chalaanaa avaidh he jo maamle main adhikaar kshetra nahin rakhti
 He argued that Delhi is divided into nine judicial districts and therefore cases related to killings during riots should be tried in courts having proper jurisdiction
 malik ne kaha ki kyonki aparaadh sultanpuri or dilli cantonment kshetra main hua isliye maamle kramash: rohinee tathaa dwarka adaalaton main chalaae jane chahie
 However, CBI counsel DP Singh said that the request of the accused has already been disposed of by a special CBI judge in Karkardooma
 sibiai ke vakil di pi singh ne kaha ki filon ko keval prashasnic uddeshyon se maamalon ke upyukt aavanton ko lekar prastut kiya gaya he
 The CBI claimed that the files related to the two cases have been sent by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) to the special judge at Karkardooma

 The District Judge said, 'who gave this power to the ACMM

 The opposing counsel said that he did not have the right to speak in the matter, to which Phulka said that the matter was related to the sentiments of the people and that the community had a wider interest in it

 On March 20, the ACMM refused to take Sajjan Kumar's petition on record and demanded some documents related to the charge sheet filed against him in the riot case and ordered him to appear before the CBI court

 BJP protested outside the Commission's office in Kolkata against this decision
 jiske baad ab ye maamla ek baar phir supreme court pahunch gaya he, jis par buudhvaar ko sunwaayee hogi
 In fact, during the nomination, incidents of violence were reported in many areas
 jiske baad bijepi ne aarope lagaaya tha ki unke ummidavaaron ko sattadhari trinmul ne namakan patr nahin bharne die or marpet kii
 Following this complaint, the nomination date was sought to be extended
 rajya chunaav ayog ne is maang ko maanate hue namakan daakhil karne kii miyaad badha bhi di thi, lekin baad main unhone waapas le liya
 Commission sources said that State Election Commissioner AK Singh has revoked the earlier order that extended the period for filing nomination papers for panchayat elections
 ayog ke is faisle par vipakshi partiyon ne sattadhari trinmul congress par aarope lagaaya he
 The CPI (M) and BJP have said that the State Election Commission has been forced by the ruling Trinamool Congress to rescind the previous order to extend the deadline
 ayog kii adhisuchana main ye kaha gayarajya nirvachan ayog kii ore se jari nai adhisuchana main kaha gaya, 'aisa lagata he ki namakan kii taarikh badhaane ke liye supreme court kii ore se koi khaas nirdesh nahin die gaye hai
 Therefore, after studying all the documents and considering all the points, the Commission withdraws that order and (previous) cancels the order
 9 april thi aakhri taarikhabata den ki 1,3 or 5 may ko hone vaale panchayat chunaavon ke liye namakan patr daakhil karne kii aakhri taarikh 9 april thi
 While the Commission had extended its period till 3 pm today (10 April)
 vipaksh kii shikayaton ke baad ayog ne miyaad badhaane kaa yah faisla liya tha
 According to the new notification, the Election Commissioner has received two letters from the special secretary of the state government and the Trinamool Congress
 in donon patron main ayog ke pehle ke aadesh main kanoon kii visangatiyon kaa hawala diya gaya tha
 BJP BJP President Dilip Ghosh alleged that Trinamool Congress pressurized the Election Commission to withdraw its previous order
 vahiin, rajya vidhansabha main makapa ke netaa sujan chakravarti ne aarope lagaaya ki nirvachan ayog ko koi aazaadee nahin he or rajya ke mantriyon ne us par dabaav daalaa he
 Rejecting the tmc's opposition, the Trinamool MP Kalyan Banerjee said that leaders of opposition parties had pressured the commission to give an 'illegal order' to extend the deadline
 phir supreme court pahunchaa kesaek baar phir ye cese supreme court pahunch gaya he
 The decision of the State Election Commission has been challenged in a petition
 jis par court buudhvaar ko sunwaayee karegaa
 However, earlier on April 9, while hearing the case, the court rejected the bjp's plea, saying it should not interfere in the elections

 Ravi Shastri praised the bowling unit as well as the batsmen of Team India
 unhone kaha ki ajinkya rahane, rohit sharma ne shandaar ballebaaji kii

 pradhanmantri narendra modi or uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath 25 disambar ko magenta metro line kaa udghaatan karne aa rahe hai
 Meanwhile, flat buyers are preparing to protest against them
 piem modi or siem yogi ke noida aagaman se flats khariddaar behad khafa hai
 In fact, before the government was formed at the Center and UP, BJP had promised that action would be taken against the builder who did not give flat time to the buyers and people would be provided houses, but after the formation of the government, no concrete action has been taken so far
 is maamle main modi or yogi sarkaar kaa ravaiya dhulmul he
 Flat buyers have released the poster, which is said to protest in Noida's Sector-16 from 11 am on 25 December
 isamen zyaadaatar khariddaar amrapali aurajepi builderke hai
 For this, home buyers have started its campaign, where buyers are being added through tweets
 zyaadaatar khariddaar is baat ko lekar pareshaan hai ki saat se aath saal tak intjaar karne ke baad bhi unako ghar nahin mila
 The builders are still not taking the name of giving flats and are playing a jumble
 khariddaaron kaa kahana he ki hamane twit kar bhi piem modi se poocha he ki kai baar ghar nahin milane kii samasya ko lekar piemo ko patr bhej chuke hai, lekin aaj tak is par koi jawaab kyon nahin mila
 What happened to the promise that was promised to get the house during the election? It should be known that there are about 1
5 lakh buyers in the city who have been opposing the builder and authority over the flats for the last several years
 haalanki unki samasya ab bhi jas kii tas he
 After the change of power, the Chief Minister did the work of healing his problem, but he is not satisfied

 Sri Lanka secured two points in the Super Eight of the T20 Championship after defeating New Zealand in the Super Over in a tie-up match that culminated in a thrill from stormy innings by Rob Nicol and Tillakaratne Dilshan
 newjiland ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karte hue saat wicket par 174 ran banaaye
 Sri Lanka's team failed to take advantage of the fiery start and managed to score 174 runs for six wickets, which led to a super over for the result
 srilanka ne super over main pehle ballebaaji kii
 Tim Southee bowled well in this over and Mahela Jayawardene, Tisara Perera and Tillakaratne Dilshan did not allow a boundary
 is bich unhone teen wide kii jisase srilanka 13 ran batorne main safal rahaa
 Lesith Malinga showed his yorker here and allowed New Zealand to score only six runs
 martin guptil or brandan maikulam ke paas maalinga kii gendon kaa koi jawaab nahin tha
 Earlier the innings of both the teams revolved around the charismatic performance of the opening pairs
 newjiland kii taraf se nichol ne 40 gend par teen chaukon or chaar chhakkon kii madad se 58 ran banaaye tathaa is bich guptil (34 gend par 38 ran) ke saath pehle wicket ke liye 57 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 For Sri Lanka, Dilshan (75 off 52 balls with five fours and three sixes) and captain Mahela Jayawardene (44 off 26 balls) gave the team a stormy start by sharing 80 runs off only 44 balls for the first wicket but The bowlers of New Zealand returned the match and tied the match
 yah saatvaan tii20 antarrashtriya match tha jo taai chuta
 The New Zealand record has been part of four tie matches
 usne super over main yah doosraa match ganvaaya
 The interesting figure of this match was that Jayawardene and Man of the Match Dilshan also completed 1000 runs in T20 international cricket during their innings
 jayavardhane is mukaam par pahunchane vaale duniya ke chauthe or srilanka ke pehle ballebaaj bane
 Dilshan touched the figure a short time later
 kumaar sangakaara (14 gend par 21 ran) keval 12 ran se is mukaam par pahunchane se chook gayi
 The way Sri Lanka started, it seemed that they would easily achieve the target
 rose tailor ne spinner nathan maikulam se gendbaaji kaa aagaaj karaayaa lekin dilashaan ne unke pehle over main hi do chauke or chakka jadkar apane iraade saaf kar diye
 Southee was targeted by both Jayawardene and Dilshan, who conceded 30 runs in the first two overs
 srilanka ne powerple ke chah over main 68 ran batore jo is toornament main sarvaadhik he
 Jacob Oram made New Zealand's first success by dismissing Jayawardene who hit three fours and as many sixes in his innings
 jayavardhane kaa sthaan lene ke liye aaye sangakaara ne oram kii lagaataar gendon par chauke lagaaye lekin dilashaan ke saath gafalat main vah ran out ho gayi
 New batsman Jeevan Mendis (8) did not last long but Dilshan remained frozen
 srilanka ko jab do over main 21 ran kii darkaar thi tab dilashaan ne james franklin kii gend par chakka jadkar ran or gend kaa antar kam kiya lekin agali gend par teji se doosraa ran churaane ke prayaas main vah ran out ho gayi
 Earlier, apart from Nicole and Guptill, for New Zealand, Brandon mccullum scored 25 off 16 balls and captain Ross Taylor scored 23 off 15 balls
 newjiland kii pari kii khaasiyat uske ballebaajon kaa spinneron ke khilaaf khulkar khelnaa rahaa
 Ajanta Mendis was not fully fit but was selected in the team
 unhone chaar over main 48 ran lutaaye or ek wicket liya
 Nicole hit a total of 24 runs with three sixes in his one over
 inamen se duusare chakke se unhone tii20 main apana doosraa ardhashatak bhi puraa kiya
 Playing his first match, Akila Dhananjay did an impressive performance and took two wickets for 32 runs
 dhananjay ne apane pehle over main hi guptil ko out kiya
 He left a catch on his own ball which also hurt his nose
 maikulam ne dhananjay par do chakke lagaaye lekin ajanta mendis kii gend par vah bhi seemaa rekha par kaich thama gayi
 When Nicole was adopting a stormy style, he was caught at the boundary line in an attempt to hit a six off Dhananjay
 nuwan kulshekhara ne tailor or jaikab oram (6) ko apane ek over main out kiya jisase newjiland antim do overon main apekshit teji se ran nahin bana paaya
 Admittedly, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj (reference: Lalit Modi) is a liberal
 shivaraj singh chouhan vyapam ghotaale ke vislabloar hai or vasundhara par lage aarope pramanik nahin hai lekin yah sawaal to phir bhi bana rahata he ki modi sarkaar ko cricket kii saaf safai se kisne roka tha? vyapam ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye adalati chaabuk kaa intjaar kyon kiya gaya? khelon main farjivada rokane vaale vidheyak ko kanoonee jama pehanaane main koun baadha daal rahaa he? paardarshita ke liye kanoonee or sansthagat dhaancha banane main koun-si samasya he? modi sarkaar agar is tarah ke kadamon va faislon ke saath aaj sansad main khadi hoti to ek saal ke bheetar bhrashtachar par use unheen sawaalon kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa jo vah pichley kai varshon se lagaataar congress se puuchhati rahi he
 The more serious aspect of the pull of Parliament is that in the first one year of the Modi government, there was no visible difference in transparency on high positions, which was expected from him
 centre se lekar rajyon tak bijepi ko sharmidagi main daalane vaale taaje vivaad darasal gavarnence kii galtiyaan hai, sattajnya ahankaar yaa beficri jinaki vajah hoti he
 These mistakes come in the first year because the government has disagreed with the current system, far from taking new measures for transparency in governance in the last one year
 daagi vyakti se duuri bananaa saamaanya satarkta he
 Therefore, when an experienced minister like Sushma Swaraj uses his position so recklessly to help the criminal Lalit Modi in the eyes of the law, it is astonishing
 swaraj or lalit modi ke bich paariwarik va peshewar rishton kii roshni main sushamaa ko or zyada satark hona chahie tha
 If the help of the former IPL chief is the fault of the foreign minister, then this omission is actually the result of the failure to be in power
 lalit modi ke khilaaf gaiyr jamaanti warrant jari hone par sushamaa zyada mushkil main hongi
 Seeing Pankaja Munde's Chikki and Khichdi purchase decisions, even a clerk will tell that such decisions are due to the power of power
 rajya sarkaar ke niyamon ke mutabik, ek karod rupye se upar kii kharid tender se hi ho sakati he jabaki pankaja ne ekamusth 206 karod ru
 Made a purchase
 is saptaah vidhansabha main unhone yah galati maan bhi lee
 150 crores of purchase of farming machines in Maharashtra Rs
 or ghotaalaa khulaa he, jisamen tender ke saamaanya niyamon kaa khulaa ulanghan kiya gaya he
 It should be worried that if other ministers in the new governments of BJP have also taken arbitrary decisions like Sushma or Pankaja, then many big difficulties are coming up for the party and Modi government in the coming months
 sirf shanta kumaar hi nahin, bijepi main kai log yah kehete mil jaaenge ki paardarshita ko lekar modi sarkaar ko kahin zyada sakht hona chahie tha
 There was also no lack of opportunities to show vigor
 masalan, satta main aane ke baad bijepi sporting frod vidheyak ko paarit kar sakati thi taaki cricket kaa keechad saaf ho sake
 The bill that provides for imprisonment and heavy fines for offenses like betting has been pending for two years and without this, there can be no strict action against Meiyappan and Kundra who are sentenced under the recommendations of the Lodha Committee
 isi kram main khel sanghon ko kanoon ke daayre laane kii pahal bhi khelon ko saaf-suthra banane ke prati modi sarkaar kii gambhirtha kaa saboot ban sakati thi
 But instead of strengthening the urges for transparency, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley not only advised the CBI that it would have to understand the difference between honest error and corruption in decisions, but also to prepare for changes in the anti-corruption law
 Started bajet satr ke ant main sarkaar vislabloar kanoon main sanshodhan le ai, jiske tahat bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane ko buree tarah hatotsahit karne kaa prastaav he
 If this amendment was passed, the fight against corruption would become almost impossible
 agar soochna ke adhikaar par taaje pehre is fehrist main jod liye jaaen to gavarnence main paardarshita ko lekar sarkaar kii niyat par sawaal uthanaa lajimi he
 The latest controversies make the government realize that not only governance and mistakes, but also defense of mistakes, Congress practices are the same
 madhya pradesh ke governor ramanaresh yadav ko farvari main hi vidaa ho janaa chahie tha jab vyapam ghotaale main exiar hui thi
 After the latest order of the Supreme Court, it does not mean to continue in his post
 yah maanate hue ki yadav, bhopal ke rajbhavan main congress kii viraasat hai, unhen banaae rakhkar sarkaar upie jaisi fajihat ko nyotaa de rahi he
 The 'mistakes' of ministers like Sushma and Pankaja suggest that even in BJP governments, the urge for transparency is not strong
 taaja vivaad, ucch padon par bhrashtachar ko lekar sarkaar ke netritv kaa asamanjas jaahir karte hai
 The UPA government likewise kept avoiding double-handed decisions on corruption in high positions
 natijatan adaalaton ne sakhti kii or sarkaar apni saakh ganvaa baithi
 For the first time since coming to power, the Modi government is looking defensive and the courts have become active again on corruption
 pradhanmantri ko ehsaas hona chahie ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sakht hue bina baat nahin banegi
 For this, they have to set rigid standards of transparency in high positions, because the deadlock of the opposition in Parliament is not such a big challenge, the bigger confusion is that the government which came to power riding on the mandate against corruption, corruption within a year Is defensive

 The Allahabad High Court, in its judgment on the disputed site of the Ramjanmabhoomi Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, ruled it to be the birthplace of Lord Ram
 nyaayamurti di ve sharma, nyaayamurti sudhir agarwal or esayu khan ne guuruuvaar ko sunaaye apane faisle main ek mat se yah mana he ki ayodhya kaa vivaadit sthal hi bhagwaan ram kaa janm sthaan he
 However, Justice Khan has also stated in his judgment that both the communities have the right over the disputed site and that no temple was demolished for the construction of the mosque there
 nyaayamurtiyon ne bahumat se yah faisla diya ki vivaadit dhaanche ko masjid nahi mana ja saktaa kyonki babar ne iskaa nirmaan islamic sharia ke siddhanto ke anusaar nahi karavaaya tha
 Justice Khan did not agree with the opinion of both fellow justices on this issue and said that the disputed structure was the mosque, it was built by Babur or which was built by Babar's orders
 nyaayamurti khan ne kaha ki teenon pakshon ko ek tihaai bhaag dene kii ghoshnaa kii gai he, ‘haalanki bantwaaraa karte samay agar kisi paksh ke hisse main maamuli samaayojan kiya jaataa he to isse jis paksh kaa nuksaan hoga uski bharpai kendra sarkaar dwaara adhigruhit bhoomi ke kuch bhaag se kii jaaegi
 Justice Khan said, 'the three sides Muslim, Hindu and Nirmohi Akhada are jointly declared as the property of the disputed area (the owner of the premises as determined by the court in case number one) map prepared by advocate Shri Shiv Shankar Lal
 a b c d e and f are mentioned in Scheme 1
 teenon paksh ek tihaai hisse kaa istemaal or puja archana ke liye uskaa prabandhan karenge
 The initial order of this asset was approved
 haalanki nyaayadhish ne mana ki madhya gumbad ke neeche kaa bhaag, jahaan vartmaan main asthaayee mandir main murti rakhi gai he use antim aadesh main hinduon ko diya jayega
 During his decision, Justice Khan made the arrangement that the disputed structure was constructed as a mosque by Babar's order or by him, but direct evidence could not prove that the disputed premises, including the constructed part, belonged to or belonged to Babur
 Who created it
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki masjid banane ke liye koi mandir nahin giraaya gaya, balki uskaa nirmaan mandir ke khandhiron par kiya gaya, jo bahut samay se vahaan maujuud the
 Justice Agarwal said in his order, 'it is declared that the portion of the dome between the three-fold structure, which is disputed as the birthplace of Lord Rama and according to the faith and belief of Hindus, is the birthplace of Lord Rama, He belongs to the Yachti (lord Ram's side) and should not be obstructed or interfered with in any way by the defendants
 ’‘haalanki yah spasht kiya jaataa he ki is aadesh ke dwaara yachi (bhagwaan ram kii taraf kaa paksh) ke hisse main teen gumbad vaale dhaanche ke bich vaale gumbad ke bhaag ko bhi joda jaae
 Justice Aggarwal said that the Ram Chabutra, Sita kitchen and storehouses located in the outer courtyard should be added to the part of the Nirmohi Akhara and handed over possession to a person who is not in a better ownership position
 nyaayamurti agarwal ne kaha ki bahari praangan ke khule bhaag ko nirmohi akhaada or bhagwaan ram kii taraf vaale paksh main baant diya jaae kyonki aam taur par iskaa istemaal dono sthanon par hinduon dwaara puja archana ke liye kiya jaataa he
 'however, it is clarified that the Muslim side's share shall not be less than one-third of the total of the premises and if necessary it may also be given some portion of the outer courtyard
 ’nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‘yah bhi spasht kiya jaataa he ki teenon pakshon ke hisson kaa nirdhaaran karte samay agar vibhinn pakshon ke hisse main kuch maamuli samaayojan kiye jate hai to isse prabhavit hone vaale paksh ko bharat sarkaar ke adhigrahan vaale bhubhag se jameen dekar uski bharpai kii jaae
 In his conclusion on these matters, Justice Agarwal said that the Muslim side failed to prove that the disputed property was built by Babur in 1528
 nyaayamurti sharma ne ek pruthak faisla likhte hue vyavastha di ki vivaadit sthal bhagwaan ram kaa janm sthaan he
 'it is the birthplace of a divine person and is revered
 unhen divya aatma maanakar unki puja kii jaati he
 'justice Sharma said,' Divine power can exist for anyone anywhere in any shape or form at all times with his own beliefs and it can also be formless
 ’vivaadit dhaanche par nyaayamurti sharma ne kaha, ‘iskaa nirmaan babar ne karavaaya tha, kis varsh main, yah nishchit nahin he, lekin yah islam ke siddhanton ke khilaaf tha isliye ise masjid nahin kaha ja saktaa
 He differed from the other two judges by arranging that the disputed structure was constructed at the same place after demolishing the old structure
 unke anusaar, ‘bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan vibhaag ne sabit kiya he ki vah dhaancha vishaal hindu dharmik imaarat thi
 He said that in the dome in the middle of the disputed structure, statues were kept on the intervening night of 22 and 23 December 1949
 bhitari or bahari praangan vaale vivaadit sthal kii sthiti ke bare main nyaayamurti sharma ne kaha, ‘yah siddh hua he ki mukademe vaali sampatti ram chandra ji kii janmabhumi he or ‘charan’, ‘sita rasoi’, anya murtiyon or vivaadit sampatti par maujuud anya poojaneey vastuon kii puja kaa adhikaar aam taur par hinduon ko he
 He said, 'it is also an established fact that Hindus worship the disputed place as their birthplace and it is a holy pilgrimage center for them
 ’nyaayadhish ne kaha ki vivaadit dhaanche ke nirmaan ke baad, ‘yah sabit hua ki vivaadit dhaanche ke bheetar murtiyon ko 22-23
 12
 1949 ko sthapit kiya gaya tha
 It is also an established fact that the outer courtyard was purely owned by the Hindus and they worshiped in it and in the inner courtyard (in the disputed structure) they have continued to worship
 unhone kaha, ‘yah bhi sthapit ho chukaa he ki vivaadit dhaanche ko masjid nahin mana ja saktaa kyonki uskaa nirmaan islam ke siddhanton ke anuroop nahin kiya gaya

 The daily Tribune report quoted Professor Barkat as saying that the pattern of migration in the last 49 years has been moving in the same direction

 Barkat has said this in his book 'political economy of reforming agriculture-land-water bodies in Bangladesh'
 ye kitaab 19 november ko prakashit hokar ai he
 Barkat, an exodus of more than 2 lakhs every year, told during the release of the book at Dhaka University that between 1964 and 2013, about 13 million Hindus left Bangladesh due to religious discrimination and persecution

 However, when asked if the UPA gets a majority, who will be the Prime Minister? He kept on avoiding
 unhone kaha ki is par gathbandhan dwaara parinaam aane ke baad ghoshnaa kii jaaegi
 Eminent lawyer and former Union Minister Sibal was asked why the Congress was reluctant to declare Rahul Gandhi as its Prime Ministerial candidate
 He said, 'if Congress had got 272 (seats), there would have been no hesitation
 'jor dene par ki congress abhi bhi rahul gandhi ko apane pradhanmantri ummidavaar ke taur par aage badha sakati or kah sakati he ki agar party ko bahumat miltaa he to vah pradhanmantri honge
 To this he said, 'of course
 
 If we get a majority then there is no doubt
 
 (but) there is no question of saying it
 ham jaanate hai ki hamen bahumat nahin milegaa
 We know that we will not get 272 (seats), we also know that BJP will not get more than 160 seats
 'jab unase kaha gaya ki vah ek bada bayaan de rahe hai to unhone jawaab diya, 'kyon nahin, bilkul, hamen (bahumat) nahin milegaa
 There is no possibility
 ' sibbal se phir se poocha gaya ki kya vah kahana chaahate hai ki congress ko bahumat nahin milegaa? is par unhone kaha, 'hamen apane dam par 272 siten nahin milengi
 It would be foolish of me to say that getting majority and BJP will get less than 160 seats
 ' iske saath hi unhone kaha ki congress kii aguwai vaale upie ko chunaav main badhat hasil hogi or yah sarkaar bana saktaa he
 However, it also has to fight the 'grand Alliance'
 'mahagathbandhan' uttar pradesh main kuch vipakshi partiyon kaa gathbandhan he
 Asked who could be the Prime Minister if the Congress-led UPA wins a majority? Sibal said it would be decided by the alliance
 
 All this will happen after 23 May (announcement of results)
 yah puche jane par ki rahul gandhi ke alaava koi doosraa ho saktaa he? unhone kaha, 'mujhe nahin pataa
 The alliance will decide
 is vishay par gathbandhan ke saajhedaar faisla karenge
 As far as the Congress party is concerned, he is the undisputed leader in the Congress
 ' mahagathbandhan kii kshamta ke sandarbh main sawaal karne par sibbal ne kaha ki ise congress ne nahin banaaya he
 He said, 'our alliance is united
 hamaari party ke saath gathbandhan he
 All our alliances date back to 2014 and remain intact, be it NCP or DMK
 hamane do or ko joda he
 It has JDS in Karnataka and CPI-M in West Bengal
 ' yah zikr karne par ki samaajawaadee party (sapa) ne alag hokar bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke saath gathbandhan kar liya
 The SP was earlier with the Congress
 is par sibbal ne kaha, 'yah hamaari galati nahin he
 Our coalition partners are united
 hamane unamem se kisi ko nahin choda he, balki hamane apane gathbandhan saajhedaaron ko joda he
 ' saal 2021 tak bharat ko hindu raashtra banane kaa elaan karne valedharm jaagran samanvay samiti ke sanyojak rajeshwarasingh ko unke pad se hataa diya gaya
 Obviously, this decision is of the Sangh
 rajeshwar singh us vakt surkhiyon main aae the jab unhoneagara main 8 disambar ko dharmantarankaryakram yojit kiya tha
 Though Rajeshwar is removed, there are talks about his health deteriorating, but in the power and political squirrels, its meaning is being removed somewhat differently
 kendra main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad dharmantaran aisa pehla mudda bana par jis par modi ko khamoshi akhriyaar kerani padi
 Rajeshwar Singh was making a statement on all TV channels by making a 56-inch chest sewn to make India a Hindu nation
 udhar, vipaksh is maamle par sansad main sarkaar ko gher rahaa tha
 The entire winter session fell on this uproar
 sawaalon se pareshaan modi ko bayaanbazi karne vaale mantriyon, saansadon or party netaaon ko kadi hidaayat deni padi
 In fact, Modi realized that the government's image on the issue of conversion was getting tarnished somewhere
 janata or khaskar desh ke alpsankhya samudaay main sarkaar ke prati vishwaas jagaanaa zaruri ho gaya
 The Modi government took the initiative and made a plan for this
 jisaki kaman alpsankhyak maamalon ke rajyamantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ke haath he
 Naqvi will meet the minorities of the country and tell them what the Central Government thinks about this
 or logon se vikaas ke liye dharm or jati se upar uthne kii baat karenge
 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi is so serious about this matter, in such a situation, the sudden removal of Rajeshwar Singh cannot be the same
 yahaan ek khaas baat ye he ki sangh kii taraf se jo khabaren aa rahi hai wo safataur par ye ishaara karti hai ki modi sangh se nahin balki sangh ab modi se he
 The exclusion of Rajeshwar Singh is proof that PM Modi has managed to put pressure on the Sangh
 wo aise logon ko pad se hataa dena chaahate hai jo bhagava brigade ko phir se puraane agenda par laane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Now, whatever the leaders of the Sangh or BJP may say, but Modi's stand is clear that he will not tolerate any such thing which will cause trouble for his government or spoil the image of the government
 is baat ko aise bhi samajha ja saktaa he ki ye un logon ke khilaaf modi kii muhim kii shuruyaat he jo lagaataar apane bayanon yaa kaamon se sarkaar ke liye kahin naa kahin pareshaani khadi karte aa rahe hai
 Perhaps this is also a message that Modi is now the real 'government'
 uttar pradesh kii samaajawaadee party ne aagaamee 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye abhi se taiyaari shuru kar di he
 For this, a letter has been issued on behalf of Uttar Pradesh President Naresh Uttam Patel
 isamen unhone saaf kiya he ki kisi aapraadhik prishthbhumi vaale candidet ko tikat nahin diya jayega
 According to the letter, those who have to apply for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections will have to send their information in a format given by the party
 form ke saath 10 hajaar rupee kaa aavedan shulk jamaa karaayaa jayega
 The applicant will also have to state in the format whether there is any lawsuit against him or not
 use samaajawaadee bulatin kaa aaajeevan sadsy hona chahie, samaajawaadee party kaa sakriy sadsy hona chahie or saath hi saath aavedankarta ke upar samaajawaadee party ke pradesh karyaalay athwa kisi bhi karyaalay kaa koi bhi shulk bakaayaa nahin hona chahie
 But the most important thing is that this time the Samajwadi Party has sought details from its party leaders along with the application that there is no criminal case filed against them
 samaajawaadee party kii pravaktaa juhi singh ke mutabik aisa party adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke nirdesh par ho rahaa he or samaajawaadee party chaahati he ki uske saare aavedankarta orchunaav ke liecandidats saaf-suthri chhavi vaale hon
 There is no case or serious charge against them, hence this information has been sought in writing
 gauratlab he samaajawaadee party samet tamaam partiyaan abhi tak daagi candidet ko dene se parhez nahin karti rahi hai
 This is the first time in writing that information about criminal cases has been sought from a party
 saath hi 10 hajaar rupee kii rakam jamaa karne kaa aadesh bhi pehali baar koi party kar rahi he
 There is also the logic of the party behind this so that the Serious candidate can apply and the funds can also be arranged for the party fund
 baharhaal is aadesh se charchaa is baat kii he ki kya vaaki samaajawaadee party saaf chhavi vaale candidats ko hi aagaamee chunaav main utaarna chaahati he yaa phir saaf chhavi hone kaa sirf dikhaava karnaa chaahati he
 If history is considered, BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party or Congress including Samajwadi Party is not such a party in which candidates with tainted image have not contested the election
 ab dekhnaa yah he samaajawaadee party is jaankaree kaa vaaki tikat bantwaare main istemaal karti he yaa phir kagaji khanaapurti karke chhod detii he
 This day is special in the pages of history, because on this day Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambed, along with his 3,80,000 companions, renounced Hinduism and embraced Buddhism
 1950 ke dashak main hi baba sahib buddha dharm ke prati aakarshith hue or buddha sammelan main bhaag lene srilanka (tab ceylone) gaye
 On October 14, 1956, he embraced Buddhism in Nagpur with his millions of supporters
 haalanki unke anuyaayiyon kii sankhya alag-alag bataai jaati rahi he
 From the 22 pledges he took on this occasion, he completely abandoned Hinduism and its method of worship
 doctor ambedkar ke saath lakhon daliton ne buddha dharm apanaaya or ye puri duniya main dharm parivartan kii sabase badi ghatana thi
 However, he himself described it as not a change of religion, but a liberation from religion-borne physical, mental and economic slavery
 ambedkar kaa janm hindu jati main achhut or nichali maani jane vaali mahaar jati main hua tha
 He adopted not only a social but also legal way to eliminate the prevailing untouchability in Hinduism
 ve maanate the ki kanoon main badlaav laakar hi dil or dimag main badlaav sambhav he
 His adoption of Buddhism was not followed by untouchability and caste practices in Buddhism
 hindu paidaa to hua hum, lekin hindu maruunga nahimbedkar jis takat ke saath daliton ko unka haq dilaane ke liye unhen ekajute karne or raajnneetik-saamaajik rup se unhen shashakt banane main jute the, utani hi takat ke saath unke virdohi bhi unhen rokane ke liye jor laga rahe the
 After a long struggle, when Ambedkar was convinced that he could not remove caste system and untouchability from Hinduism, he made a historical statement in which he said that i am born a Hindu, but a Hindu will not die
 hindu code bill par virodhazadeeke baad panditnehruke mantrimandal main doctor ambedkar kanoon mantri bane or nehru kii pahal par unhone hindu code bill taiyaar kiya, lekin is bill ko lekar bhi unhen jabardast virodh jhelana padaa
 Nehru himself was then seen bowing to the increasing pressure on this issue inside and outside his party
 is mudde par matbhed is kadar bade ki ambedkar ne kanoon mantri ke pad se istipha de diya
 Although the Hindu Code Bill was later passed and it also revolutionized the status of Hindu women, it was flexible in many respects with Ambedkar's bill

 He said that those who warned him included a top journalist of a television news channel

 The attack on Prashant Bhushan, a prominent member and senior advocate of Team Anna, took place last week, making the issue of plebiscite advocacy in Jammu and Kashmir an issue
 anna ke andolan par vishesh kaverejahaalanki yah daawa kiya gaya ki prashanth bhushan par hamale ke peeche jammu-kashmir main janamatsangrah karaane kaa unka bayaan he, team anna is puri ghatana ke peeche sajeesh dekh rahi he
 Kejriwal says the attack on the senior advocate was an attempt to distract from the corruption issue
 unhone police kii karrwai par sawaal karte hue aarope lagaaya tha ki police ne hamalaavaron ke khilaaf teji se karrwai nahin kii
 Kejriwal wondered if there was any direction from above 'to do so
 anna: ramlila maidan, vaaya mayur vihaar tu tihaad
 
 
 Kejriwal said on Friday that we do not think it was a comment on Kashmir that provoked the attack
 aisa prathit hota he ki sabhi bhrasht log ek jagah jamaa ho gaye hai
 This was an attempt to divert attention from corruption, we think it is a conspiracy

 This comment from Root was recorded on the stump mic and went live
 log root kii kaaphi tarif kar rahe hai or unhen best captain bataa rahe hai

 But the boy i will praise here will appreciate the root's reaction
