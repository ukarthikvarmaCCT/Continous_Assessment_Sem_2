 Do they condemn every incident of firing on the border? pakistan ke raksha mantri khwaja mohammad asif do-do baar kah chuke hai ki agar hamaari shanti ko khatara hua to ham parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa istemaal karenge or bharat ko nestanabood kar denge
 This is the statement of a member of the cabinet of Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif, who wants peace
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne shuukravaar ko kashmir par cabinet kii baithak bulaai he
 Nawaz Sharif convened a joint session of Parliament on 5 October
 alert kii sthiti to pakistan kii taraf se bhi he lekin iske baad bhi bhartiya sena ne karrwai ko anjaam de diya
 The army is full of congratulations
 ek khaas baat yah he ki jo bhi detail saamne ai he usase yahi pataa chalata he ki puri karrwai main sena ko kuch bhi nuksaan nahin hua he, na hi pakistan ne aisa koi daawa kiya he
 Pakistan has said that their army has given a befitting reply but two of its soldiers have been killed
 sena ke aupchaarik bayaan main oparation kii baarik jaankariyaan nahin hai lekin sutron ke hawaale jo baaten samvaadadaataaon tak pahunch rahi hai uske hisaab se niyantran rekha ke paar sargical strike kii yojana udi hamale ke fouran baad bana lee gai thi
 The Prime Minister was aware of this but the approval was given only on Wednesday afternoon
 ek hafte se niyantran rekha ke paar aatankiyon ke launch pads par nigaah rakhi ja rahi thi
 The operation was carried out at seven places within a 250 km radius of the Line of Control

 Special force teams from Poonch, Mendhar, Machil and Naugaon entered the Line of Control for two kilometers

 During the operation quoting sources, 36 terrorists were claimed to be killed and two Pakistani soldiers were killed
 oparation main shaamil javaanon ko ye saafe nirdesh die gaye the ki wo kisi bhi jawan kaa shav yaa apane kisi saathi ko peeche chhodkar naa aaen
 About one hundred and fifty commandos of the special paras carried out this operation between twelve and half hours from four o'clock in the morning
 sargical strike ko anjaam dene ke liye unhen ek khaas samay avadhi di gai thi
 India has taken action ten days after the Uri incident
 bharat ne turant kuch nahin kiya magar karrwai karne main bahut deree bhi nahin kii
 People were beginning to understand from the speech given by the Prime Minister from Kerala that war is not in our interest but they should not do anything, they could not digest it
 kya seemaa paar se ghuspaith kii har koshish par yah bahes hoti rahegi
 India gives evidence, but what does those evidence mean when another incident happens and no action is taken on the previous incident
 pradhanmantri ne milakar garibi dur karne kii baat kahi thi, ab lag rahaa he ki garibi is karrwai kaa code verde to nahin tha
 Strategic strategies are made public in Code Word itself
 tippaniyan Once again tell that India has told from its side that the action is completed on its behalf
 baar baar jor diya ja rahaa he ki yah yuddh nahin he
 The answer is ab sawaal yuddh kii ashanka ko lekar gaharaa ho rahaa he
 But during the course of action after ten days, these fears must also have been fully tested by the government

 pakistan ne yahi kaha he ki unki sena ne bhi munhtod jawaab diya he lekin uske do sainik maare gaye hai
 The Army's formal statement does not contain the details of the operation, but according to the sources quoted by the sources, the surgical strike across the Line of Control was planned immediately after the Uri attack
 pradhanmantri ko isaki jaankaree thi lekin manzuri buudhvaar dopaher ko hi di gai
 The terrorists' launch pads were being watched across the Line of Control for over a week
 niyantran rekha ke paar 250 kilometre ke daayre main saat jagahon par is oparation ko anjaam diya gaya

 He said, 'till the central government does not implement the inclusive policy, the development of the country will not gain momentum
 yahi kaaran he ki desh ke aarthik growth main lagaataar utaar-chadhaav dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 The only reason for this is that the development of the country depends on a few developed states

 is katautee kaa farmaan sargical strike ke agle din hi jari kiya gaya
 The night of 28-29 September, the Indian Army's elite commandos entered the OOK and destroyed many camps of terrorists
 ye commando apni jaan ko jokhim main daal kar elosi paar gaye the
 The next day there was a noise of surgical strikes across the country and a celebration of revenge for the Uri attack

 But if a jawan gets badly injured during that operation and falls into the category of 100 disability, he would be removed from the job and the pension he received would be reduced from Rs 45,200 to Rs 27,200 per month

 In his Facebook post, Jaitley said, Congress suddenly fell in love with OBC, while it has always been anti-obc and has opportunistically supported the non-backward
 jetali ne kaha, obisi ke liye yah achaanak pyaar kyon? obisi ne 1990 se pehle congress party ko chhod diya tha
 He said, Rajiv Gandhi had given a strong statement in the Lok Sabha against the Mandal Commission

 You can stop jobs created at the pakora floor

 Backing up whatsapp chats is often very important for you
 ab tak iske liye aapako google drive kaa sahaara lenaa hota tha
 But now Google Drive storage will not have to be consumed for backup whatsapp chats
 watsap kii parent company fasebuk ne google ke saath ek deal kii he jiske tahat yugers watsap byaap apane personal acount main rahete hue free le sakate hai
 According to the agreement of whatsapp and Google, backups of whatsapp from November 12 will not take up the space of Google Cloud Storage
 ab watsap media, text or memo sahit har tarah kawotsapabedap android ke google acount par automatic byaap hoga
 whatsapp's move could prove beneficial for the company's more than 1 billion users
 aapako bataa den ki watsap ke november apadet ke saath wo sabhi watsap byaap delit kar die jaaenge jinhe saal bhar se apadet nahin kiya gaya he
 The company's users are advised to connect the phone to wifi while backing up, as backup files are separated in size and consume data, which can cost you extra money
 gauratlab he ki watsap chat byaap system duusare chating ap se alag he
 Because whatsapp's chats and media are stored on the phone instead of being stored in a detached service
 isliye phone badalte samay watsap kaa data byaap lenaa jaruri hota he, isliye yugers ko google cloud kaa sahaara lenaa hota he
 Although the data of whatsapp in iphone is backed up on icloud, its free quota of people usually ends soon

 The party recorded a landslide victory in the election, and after 1984, only one party got a majority
 ravishankar ke daawey ke mutabik to philhal soshal media par bijepi hi 20 najar aa rahi he
 But the world outside the social media, whose victory will be in the actual election results, will be known only on 23 May when the results will come

 samvidhan kaa anuchhed 35-e jammu kashmir vidhansabha ko lekar praavdhaan karata he ki vah rajya main sthaayee nivaasiyon ko parbhashit kar sake
 After independence, a new Article 35A was added to the Constitution by passing an order by President Dr
 Rajendra Prasad on May 14 in 1954
 35 a anuchhedrajya vidhayika ko yah adhikaar detaa he ki vah koi bhi kanoon bana sakati he or un kanoonon ko anya rajyon ke nivaasiyon ke saath samanta kaa adhikaar or samvidhan dwaara praapt kisi bhi anya adhikaar ke ulanghan ke tahat chunauti nahin di ja sakati he
 This means that people of other states are prohibited from buying land in Kashmir, doing government jobs or voting in assembly elections
 is kanoon ke khilaaf dilli sthit enjio 've da citigen' ne supreme court main yachika daayar ise khatm karne kii apil kii thi
 This petition stated that Article 35 AK the fundamental rights of the citizens conferred on the Constitution have been taken away in Jammu and Kashmir, so the Central Government should immediately repeal this clause applicable by order of the President
 supreme court main is babat daakhil yachika main desh main samvidhan pradutt buniyadi haq samanta ke adhikaar or khaskar langik samanta ke adhikaar ke hanan kii baat kahi gai he
 The reasoning given in this petition is as follows: - The petitioner has described it as a violation of the right to equality, Article 14 of the Constitution
 aisa isliye kyonki 35A ke tahat gaiyr kashmiri se shaadi karne vaale kashmiri purush ke bacchon ko sthaayee naagarik kaa darja or tamaam adhikaar milte hai
 But women living outside the state, ie non-kashmiri men marrying, are banned from not sharing in the property
 - yaachikkartaaka ye bhi kahana he kiis pravdhaan kaa prastaav sansad main charchaa or bahumat se paas karwaae bina samvidhan main nayaa anuchhed kaise jod diya gaya? yani sanvaidhanik aadhaar par bhi ise nirast kiya jaay
 - The matter was heard by the Division Bench of the Supreme Court
 lekin maamla samvidhan ke khaas hisse se taalluk rakhane kii vajah se agast main ise larger yani badi bench ke paas sunwaayee ke liye bheja tha
 The Larger Bench issued a notice to the Government of India during the last hearing
 court ke notice ke baad is par pehali sunwaayee ho rahi he
 BJP national president Amit Shah has claimed to have demolished Mamta's fort in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 'ajtak' ke khaas kaarykram 'sidhi baat' main shah ne kaha ki bijepi agle loksabhaa chunaav main pashchim bengal main 22 se zyada siten jeetne ja rahi he
 Targeting Mamta's fort Amit Shah, Amit Shah said that he was confident that the BJP would win at least 22 seats in West Bengal in the 2019 Kelok Sabha elections
 kyonki pashchim bengal main maahaul mamata banerjee ke khilaaf he
 Shah said, 'I have been to West Bengal 18 times
 vahaan ke log trinmul congress kii hinsa kii samskruti se tang aa gaye hai
 And they are looking towards the BJP for the change
 'amit shah ne ginaayin uplabdhiyandrasal sidhi baat kaarykram main jab amit shah se sawaal kiya gaya ki 2019 chunaav ko lekar unka kya plan he, or party kii sabase badi uplabdhi kya he jise wo aam chunaav main aage karegi? iske jawaab main shah ne kaha, 'bijepi ne garibon kerahan-sahanke str ko ooncha kiya he, nishpaksh or nirnaayak sarkaar di he, saath hi bharat ke maan-sammaan ko badhaayaa he
 This is a big achievement for us to go to the polls
 'iske alaava'ajtak'par shah ne khulaasa kiya ki party 2019 main 50 fisadi vot share ke liye ladaai ladane ke liye taiyaar he
 And BJP will reach Parliament by winning more seats across the country in 2019 than in 2014

 rana (mukul dev) kaa is cese se kya vaasta he or aakhirkaar kaatil koun he, iskaa pataa film ke aakhir main chalata he
 Weak Qian: The weak episode of the film is its typical 80s and 90s thriller story in which you will see a police officer shouting
 isamen baar-baar jail main baitha insaan begunaahi ke liye guhaar karata dikhaai detaa he
 The film's layering, in particular, could have been better depicted in a series of incidents
 twist or terns or bhi baandh kar rakhane vaale hote to film acchhee or dilachasp ban jaati
 At the same time, the writing of the characters could also be better
 kyonki film dekhne ke dauraan koi bhi nayaapan nahin miltaa
 The Grispiti story appears to be packaged once again and presented
 relies se pehle film kaa sangeet bhi hit nahin ho paaya
 Suspense could be made better

 ankhon dekhi-(2014)sanjay mishraqi ye film unke kariyar kii ab tak kii sabase shandaar filmon main se ek maani jaati he
 In this film, he played the role of a person who decides to retire from his job and tries to know the essence of life
 is dauraan kuch log use pagal kehane lag jate hai to kuch log use aadhyatmik kehete hai
 He makes his own Philosophy about life and loves to live in it
 angreji main kehete hai-(2018)is film main sanjay mishra ne umr ke is mode par bhi romantic role ko chunaa
 In the film, it was shown about such bonding of husband and wife which is usually found in every household
 magar aaj tak iske myne samaj paane main pati kaamiyaab ho paata he yaa phir patni
 The film exposes some of these misunderstandings, as well as how the mutual understanding between a husband-wife sets the foundation for a strong relationship

 Through the film, an attempt was made to show how inflation falls in a middle class family
 film ko kaaphi pasand kiya gaya tha
 But many people believed that despite adopting good ideas, the film could have been introduced in a better way
 chahen jo bhi aisi filmon kii choti-choti khaamiyon ko bekhubi dhakne ke liye sanjay mishra kii parformens se zyada or kya ho saktaa he
 He did as expected
 masaan-(2015)yun to masaan film main unka role lead nahin tha magar iske baavjood bhi film main unki acting kii tarif kii gai thi
 He played the role of Richa Chadha's father in the film who is also upset with his daughter and loves him a lot

 Let me tell you that while targeting the opposition rally in Kolkata, Modi said that the opposition parties are shouting 'save, save, save'
 rahul ne twit main likhaa, 'mahamahim, madad ke liye guhaar lakhon berozegaar yuvaaon, sankatagrast kisaanon, vanchit daliton or adivaasiyon, sataae gaye alpsankhyakon, barbaad ho gaye chote vyapaariyon kii he, ve aapke atyaachaar or aakshamata se mukt hone kii guhaar laga rahe hai

 'your highness,the cries for help are the cries of millions of unemployed youth; of farmers in distress; of oppressed Dalits & Adivasis; of persecuted minorities; of small businessmen in ruin; begging to be freed from your tyranny & incompetence

 sadhvi niranjan jyotiko lekar sansad main gatirodh jari he
 PM Narendra Modi today once again said in the Lok Sabha that Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti is new
 piem ne vivaad chhodkar deshhit main kaam karne kii apil kii he
 However, this appeal of PM does not seem to have any effect on the opposition
 piem ke bayaan se asantusht vipakshi dalon ke saansadon ne sadan se walkout kiya
 The Opposition is adamant on the resignation of the Union Minister making controversial statements
 loktantr ke mandir main pichley chaar dinon se kendriya mantri ke istife kii maang ko lekar hangaamaa ho rahaa he
 This is when Sarasadvi Niranjan Jyoti has apologized
 yahaan tak ki rajyasabha mempiem bhi bayaandekar apil kar chuke hai ki mantri kii maafee ke baad vipaksh ko shant ho janaa chahie
 But the opposition is not willing to accept the resignation of Sadhvi
 piem ne shuukravaar ko loksabhaa main kaha, 'sadhvi niranjan jyoti nai mantri hai
 They are from the village
 unhone maafee maang lee he
 We should not give much attention to this matter now
 maine apane saansadon ko bhashaa kii maryaada par dhyaan dene kii kathor hidaayat di he
 'due to opposition uproar, the Rajya Sabha had to postpone the proceedings till 12 noon
 vipaksh ke tevar se saaf he ki sansad main maamla aaj bhi garm rahegaa
 This is the reason why the Prime Minister was forced to hold a meeting with senior ministers of his party
 sansad main kaayam gatirodh ko todane ke liye aaj piem ne naa sirf senior mantriyon se vichaar-vimarsh kiya balki dal ke varisht saansadon ke saath milakar bhi rasta nikaalane kii koshish kii
 Because the pm's appeal to mps has no effect that the case should end after Sadhvi's apology
 narendra modi ne guuruuvaar ko rajyasabha main kaha tha, 'sadhvi niranjan jyoti nai mantri hai
 He has apologized
 ab sansad ke sadasyon kii maafee ke prati kya bhaavana he ye mujhe maaloom he
 The work of Parliament should be done in the interest of the country

 Anupam Kher will be seen in the role of Manmohan Singh
 2019 chunaav ke maddenjar di accidental prime ministar ko raajnneetiki galiyaaron main bade daanv ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The movie is accused of glorifying Manmohan Singh and tarnishing the image of the Gandhi family
 kai logon ne movie ko propagenda qaraar diya he
 Let's take a look at 3 important reasons to watch The accidental prime minister
 # 1
 How real life characters are portrayed on the screen is based on the book The Accidental Prime Minister of Manmohan Singh's media advisor Sanjay Baru
 film kaa subject majboot he
 Sanjay has described the helplessness of Manmohan Singh's tenure in his book
 sabhi ke jahan main sawaal he ki raajnneeti ke diggj netaaon ke real life kirdaar ko silver screen par kaise pesh kiya jayega
 In the trailer, there is glorification of Manmohan Singh
 sonia gandhi ne manmohan singh ke kaarykaal main baikfoot par rahakar kya role nibhaayaa? ye dekhnaa exciting hoga
 Makers has great casting for the film, which makes it more real
 # 2
 Who is the protagonist in the film and the villain who is watching the trailer of the Accidental Prime Minister, yet people are still in trouble as to who is the hero in the movie and who is the villain? In his book, Sanjay Baru also put Sonia Gandhi in the dock
 logon kaa kahana he movie kii aad main congress kii saakh ko dhwast karne kii koshish he
 The big question is whether the Congress and the Gandhi family are shown as villains in the film? Are Manmohan Singh and Sanjay Baru shown as heroes? Only after the release of the film will these questions be answered
 “patience is not simply the ability to wait - it’s how we behave while we are waiting

 According to information received by Aaj Tak, security agencies had issued an alert on February 8 that terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir could carry out an IED attack
 sutron ke mutabik, alert main kaha gaya tha ki jammu kashmir main aatankwaadi suraksha balon ke diployment or unke aane jane ke raste par IED se hamalaa kar sakate hai
 So, did our failure lead to such a huge terrorist attack and we had to sacrifice our precious soldiers
 is input ke baad suraksha agenciyon ne surakshabalon ke saath ek meeting bhi kii thi
 It was said in the meeting that the terrorists can target the convoy of security forces
 is hamale ko syria or afghanistan main hone vaale aatanki hamalon kii tarah anjaam diya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the security forces should take their convoy at night
 baavjood iske barfbaari ke kaaran saat din se band hive ke khulte hi din main siarpief javaanon ko srinagar le jane ke liye kafila ravaanaa ho gaya

 is maamle main siarpief ke purv aiji aarake singh ne kaha ki jab aatanki hamale kaa alert tha, tab javaanon ko jammu se helicopter ke jariye srinagar kyon nahin bheja gaya
 If they were sent by helicopter to Srinagar, there would not be such a big attack
 sarkaar ko surakshabalon ke liye aisi suvidhaayen deni hogi, taaki hamaare jawan aise hamale kaa shikaar na ho

 tippaniyan Although he is in good form with the bat, some former players feel that Dhoni is showing signs of fatigue as a captain
 lekin dravid nahin maanate ki is wicketiper-ballebaaj kii jagah bharat ke paas koi or vikalp he, jisane 2007 twanti-20 vishwacap khitaabi jeet ke alaava 2011 vanade vishwacap kii jeet main desh kaa netritv kiya tha
 Dravid said that Dhoni should make some changes in himself
 unhone kaha, vah acchhee tarah daud saktaa he or vah bharat ke sabase safal captain ke taur par dekha jayega or uske paas ab ise (safal captaini kaarykaal ko) badhaane kaa mauka he
 Apart from his good leadership ability, another reason is that Dhoni has no option at this time
 haalanki vah balle se acchhee form main he, lekin kuch purv khilaadiyon ko lagata he ki dhoni main bataur captain thakaan ke sanket dikh rahe hai
 But Dravid does not believe that India has any other option than this wicket-keeper-batsman, who led the country in the 2011 one-day World Cup victory besides the 2007 Twenty20 World Cup title win
 dravid ne kaha ki dhoni ko apane main kuch badlaav karnaa chahie
 He said, he can run well and he will be seen as India's most successful captain and he now has a chance to extend it (successful captaincy term)
 uski acchhee netritv kshamta ke alaava ek anya kaaran yah bhi he ki is samay dhoni kaa koi vikalp bhi nahin he
 Dravid said that Dhoni should make some changes in himself

 Kejriwal has said that everyone will have to work together to defeat Narendra Modi in Varanasi
 ishaaron-ishaaron main unhone saaf kar diya ki agar unhen mukhtaar ansaari kaa samarthan miltaa he to vah parhez nahin karenge
 Before Kejriwal, Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas also made a similar statement
 kumaar vishwaas ne kaha, 'amethi or varanasi kii ladaai main jo bhi sahyog de uskaa swaagat he
 'it is worth mentioning that on Thursday, the Qaumi Ekta Dal had announced that the MLA of this party, Mukhtar Ansari, will not contest from Varanasi Lok Sabha seat against Modi
 aapako bataa den ki mukhtaar 2009 main hue pichley loksabhaa chunaav main varanasi se chunaav lade the or bijepi pratyaashee murali manohar joshi se kareebi mukaable main lagbhag 20 hajaar maton se parajeet hokar duusare sthaan par rahe the
 In such a situation, he was considered a strong candidate for Varanasi seat this time
 kaumi ekta dal ke adhyaksh ansaari ne kaha ki baithak main mukhtaar ko varanasi se chunaav nahin ladaane kaa faisla isliye kiya gaya he taaki modi ke khilaaf dharmanirpeksh matadaataaon ke vot bantane naa paaen

 In such a situation, there was no other option but to make these alternative arrangements
 aashaa singh kaa ye bhi kahana tha ki chaatraon se fees lene par ek taraf roak laga di gai he
 On the other hand, funds are also not being received from the government

 On the one hand, the Nitish Kumar government is beating the drums of making education up to college level free, while the colleges are suffering from lack of funds

 wedding
 
 
 ye bandhan na sirf do logon kaa milan he, balki ye do pariwaron kaa sangam bhi he
 The bond of marriage binds the two families together in one door forever
 aapaki shaadi kaa nirnay aapaki zindagi kaa ahm faisla hota he, ye jitna aapke pati kii jindagi ko prabhavit karata he, utana hi aapke saas-sasur kii jindagi ko bhi
 So it is important that before marriage you must have a conversation with your in-laws
 aaie jaanate hai koun si ve baaten hai jo aapako shaadi se pehle hi apane sasuraal waalon ke saath kar leni chahie taaki baad main aapako apane sasuraal waalon ke saath matbhed kaa saamana naa karnaa pade
 1-to build a good relationship with your mother-in-law, you need to talk to them about your lifestyle
 shaadi ke baad aapaki jo bhi ummiden hai, behatar hoga agar aap unhen bataaen
 Talk about your office timing
 , offis se ghar lautne ke baad aap khaanaa bana sakengi yaa aapako madad ke liye maid chahie, is bare main bhi saas-sasur ke saath baatcheet karen
 By talking about your weekend plan and how to spend your personal time, you can also build a happy relationship with your in-laws
 isliye roj khaanaa chahie kelaa, jaane kitne hai phaayde2-chaahe aap shaadi ke baad naukari karnaa chaahati hon yaa ghar par koi kaam shuru karnaa chaahati hon, apane kariyar opshan ke bare main apane saas-sasur ko zarur bataaie
 If you are paying a home loan or any kind of EMI from your salary, then talking to your mother-in-law in advance about this will strengthen your future relationship
 aisa karne se aapke rishte main samajhadaari jhalkegi
 3-regarding your family and children, you may have talked to your future husband, but it is very important to talk to your father-in-law about this
 aap apana family plan bhale hi unase mat bataaie par bhavishya main family ke bare main aapke kya vichaar hai, ye unase zarur zaahir karen
 Apart from having your views about this, you can also ask their opinion so that these conversations do not seem one sided
 4-shaadi ke baad puure ghar ko sanbhaalane or sanvaarane kii zimmedaari mahila par hoti he or is baat ko ham nakaar nahin sakate
 So, it is important that you also keep your opinion in front of your in-laws in this regard
 unhen bataaen ki ghar or offis ko aap ek saath kaise sanbhaalengi
 If you want to keep meds at home, then telling them about this in advance also works to enhance the relationship of people
 5-shaadi se pehle aap apane dharmik vichaaron ke bare main bhi apane saas-sasur se khul kar baat kar len
 Whether you believe in worship or not, whether you like going to the temple or not, you should do all these things with your in-laws
 bhavishya main kisi galatarahami ke chalate aapke rishton main koi khatas na aae isliye jaruri he ki aap yah bataa den ki aap tyohaar or paramparaon ko maanati hai yaa nahin
 Do you also feel tremors while sleeping, know that being 6 means getting married does not mean dying of your expectations
 aapke sapane, aapaki icchhaaen hameshaa zindaa rahati hai
 So it is important that you talk about your dreams before marriage to your in-laws so that there is no misunderstanding in the relationship later
 7-aapke sapane kuch bhi ho sakate hai jaise 30 kii hone se pehle 30 deshon ko ghoomana, dance siikhnaa, ek formahouse khareednaa or na jane kya-kya
 If you express all your wishes well before your mother-in-law before marriage, then there will be no tension in your relationship in future
 8-shaadi se pehle apane bare main apane saas-sasur ko bataanaa kaaphi madadgaar sabit hota he
 Doing this helps your mother-in-law to understand you properly, which brings sweetness in your relationship

 dekhen yah shandaar aid: On the International Yoga Day on Sunday, where the central government is setting a world record on Rajpath, there has been a controversy on the use of Chinese mats in the program on the other hand
 mukhya vipakshi party congress or aam aadmi party (AAP) ne kaarykram main chini chatiyon ke istemaal par sawaal uthaae hai
 Both parties surrounded the government and raised the question that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has given the slogan of 'make in India', is putting so much emphasis on 'made in China' things through important events like its Yoga Day
 Hai Chinese made mats have been laid on the Rajpath for the event on Kiog Day
 kaarykram ke liye sarkaar ne chatiyon va anyasaman kaa thekaek event management company ko diya tha

 After scrutinizing the history of 160 bikes, the investigating officer reached the real bike
 jaanch ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki sabase pehle patna ke nivasee ramvilas mahato ne 2014 main bike kharidi thi
 He was then sold to the pride of Muzaffarpur
 police jab mujffapur pahunchi tab pataa chalaa ki gaurav ne bike 2016 main atul raaj ko bech di thi
 Atul revealed that he had sold the bike to Prashant Kumar of Patna on January 12 this year
 prashanth ne police ko bataaya ki 19 janvari ko uske dost ashish anand or snigdh kashyap uski bike maang kar le gaye the

 Last year gold on Dhanteras was Rs 16,200 per 10 grams, while in 2008 it was priced at Rs 12,070 per 10 grams

 a top officer also remembers that under Indira Gandhi's rule, "bureaucrats were constantly changing
" ”aaj teen dashak baad desh ko vastav main chalaane vaale naukarshah khud ko fansaa hua paa rahe hai
 They are suspicious and angry
 unki hataasha ke kai kaaran hai
 The weak minister, the shadow of the anti-corruption law and the right to information, which according to him has created an environment in which it has become impossible for him to take even a step forward or take a decision
 kuchhek mantriyon, jaise vitt, raksha, sadak parivahan or rajmarg or kamobesh railway ko chhod den to adhiktar mantri apane saare faisle us pradhanmantri karyaalay ke jimme chhod chuke hai jiske paas aktubar tak kareeb 1,200 filein lambit padi hui thim jabaki samaanya taur kuch sau filein hi lambit rahati hai

 a senior official says, "under the upa's strong ministers, there was a feeling among the officers that" My minister has approved then it is fine now
 " ” mantriyon kaa yah suraksha kavach chale jane se adhikari khud ko besahaara paa rahe hai

 Former Cabinet Secretary K

 Chandrasekhar says, "what is worrying for me is the increasing trend of transfer of officers, even at the level of joint secretary
 isane aisi dharna paidaa kii he ki kuch ko chhodkar baaki prashasnic adhikari doum darje ke hai or unke sir par lagaataar talwaar lataki hui he
 "they say that such incidents also happened in the past but were rare
" iske alaava, unke mutabik, team work ke lihaaj se bhi yah pravriti anukool nahin he
 a senior officer who has spent nearly four decades in the service describes Delhi in these words, "fear is why i should take a decision
" mujh par bharosa nahin kiya ja rahaa, meri jasusi kii ja rahi he ki main kisi se mil na sakuun
 i better protect myself and not take any decision
 ” ve kehete hai, “nitin gadakari ke awaas se jasusi upkarnon kii baramadagi ho yaa grih mantri ke putr ke vittiya lenden kaa maamla, sarkaar ne paryaapt sanket de die hai ki sab par najar rakhi ja rahi he

 Many such provisions are included in it, due to which officers are finding themselves trapped

 Now former Australian veteran spinner Shane Warne expressed his desire to join Team India, but sarcastically said that he cannot afford them
 vastav main in dinon team india ke mukhya coach ko lekar charchaa kaa daur jari he or bhartiya cricket control board ne iske liye aavedan mangaaye hai
 However, Warne has not applied for it
 jab unase is par sawaal poocha gaya, to unhone bisisiai kii aarthik kshamta par ek tarah se sawaal khadaa kar diya or uski 'beijwati' kar di
 Then what was it that Indian cricket fans got angry with and they stopped speaking of Shane Warne
 baad main vivaad badhane par worne ne is par apni safai bhi di
 In fact, Shane Warne said in his statement that the BCCI does not have the money to pay his fees and cannot contract him, which is why he did not apply for the coach position
 worne ne yah bhi kaha ki vah viraat kohli ke saath kaam karnaa chaahate hai, lekin aisa sambhav nahin ho paa rahaa he
 After this statement by Shane Warne, he started furiously on Twitter
 baad main in tippaniyon se pareshaan worne ne twit kiya, jisamen unhone safai di ki bharat (bisisiai) unka kharch nahin uthaa saktaa vaali baat mahaj ek majaak thi
 He targeted the media and said that this is very bad journalism
 ek bayaan ke rup main ise galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya
 i have never said this to anyone, quite disappointing journalism
 Re Indian coaching position
 i was in a lift & was asked if i would put my hat in the ring i said "india can't afford me" tongue in cheek! - Shane Warne (@shanewarne) June 7, 2017ps re @ imvkohli & i would work well together as a quote, this is totally made up
 i never said that to anyone, very disappointing journalism— Shane Warne (@shanewarne)june 7, 2017ek cricket fain ne shen worne se kaha ki vah vikipedia par jaakar dekhen, vahaan pataa chalegaa ki bisisiai kya he
 He told that BCCI is currently the richest cricket board and can buy anyone
 usne worne kii taluna snapchet ke siio se kar di, jinhone bharat ko haal main hi ek garib desh kaha tha
 Another fan wrote, Shane Warne says that India cannot afford me as a coach
 is par bisisiai unhen jawaab detii he ki mere paas drugs he
 Then Shane Warne India - 'india India' starts chanting
 Shane warne- India cannot afford me as their coach 
 BCCI- we have drugsshane warne- Indiaa Indiaa — Being Bing (@ya_jhakaas) June 6, 2017 In another advice, Fan wrote, "warne you should keep your mouth shut
 aadhe se adhik australian khilaadi apana ghar or car sirf bisisiai kii vajah se kharid paae hai
 Shane Warne should shut his mouth
 Half of the Australian cricketers have their own home & car only because of BCCI
 - Sunil- The Cricketer (@ 1sinto2s) June 6, 2017 Likewise many cricket fans commented on Shane Warne
 kuch coment aise bhi hai, jinhen yahaan nahin diya ja saktaa
 However, Warne sensed the fragility of the occasion and gave it an explanation

 jise badha kar 2500 bed kaa kar diya jayega
 The hospital is 49 years old
 is vakt 610 bed he
 a super specialty hospital is being built on the campus of the same hospital which is probably nearing completion
 jisamen 300 bed honge
 If you add it to 610 then soon 910 beds will be ready
 uske baad 600 atirikt bed is aspataal main banane ke liye kam se kam do aspataal banane honge
 Then two more will have to be built to meet the 2500 target
 vaise hamen nahin maaloom ki mukhyamantri ne saal bhar ke bheetar 1500 bed banane kaa elaan kiya he usamen pehle se ban rahe 300 bed ke aspataal kaa hisaab shaamil he yaa nahin
 The cost of one bed for a super specialty hospital comes from 85 lakh to 1 crore
 is laagat main imaarat or usamen hone vaali har chiz or doctor kii laagat shaamil hoti he
 If 1500 beds are made, then Nitish Kumar government will have to spend 1500 crores within a year
 2017-18 main bihar sarkaar kaa bajet hi 7002 karod kaa tha
 Which was reduced by 1000 crores as compared to 2016-17
 aspataalon ke nirmaan kaa bajet kareeb 800 karod tha
 Did diseases run away from Bihar that the health budget was reduced by 1000 crores? We have taken this information from the site of Policy Research Studies
 agar ek yatra main nitish kumaar akhbaaron main hedline ke liye 1500 se 2500 karod ke bajet ke aspataal kaa elaan kar gaye to yah bhi bataa dete ki paisa kahaan se aayega
 In this budget, the budget of entire Bihar will be finished
 130 bacchon kii maut kii sankhya choti karne ke liye 2500 bistaron kaa elaan ghinauna or shaatir dimaag kaa khel lagata he
 Everyone knows that journalists will not ask where the money will come from
 2500 bistar kaa matlab aap 500 bed ke hisaab se dekhen to 5 aspataal ban sakate hai
 Couldn't you divide these 5 hospitals in the surrounding district? Which does not require everyone to come to Muzaffarpur and save lives? There are no doctors for the 610-bed hospital
 yahi nahin 49 saal puraane shri krishna medical college aspataal main pediatric kii post graduate padhai nahin hoti he
 If there were ten PG seats here, at least 40 would have been junior or senior residents
 bihar ke privet kalege main jo baad main khule hai vahaan piji kii sari siten hai kyonki unase karod rupee kii salanaa fees lee jaati he
 Generally there should be a doctor on three beds
 agar 1500 bed kii baat kar rahe hai to kareeb 200-300 doctor to chahie hi nahin
 Beds have to be photographed or patients are also treated
 jis medical kalege kii baat kar gaye hai vahaan medical kii padhai kii maatr 100 seat he
 In 2014, Harsh Vardhan had talked about getting 250 seats
 yahaan seat de denge to privet medical kalejon ke liye shikaar kahaan se milenge
 Understand the game
 isliye nitish kumaar kii ghoshnaa sharmnaak or mazaaq he
 Do not go over the announcement that a hospital will be built
 desh main bahut se aspataal ban kar taiyaar hai magar chal nahin rahe hai
 AIIMS that opens in the street is in a similar condition
 2018 main bihar sarkaar ne ek or kamaal kaa faisla kiya
 Patna Medical College has 1700 beds
 ise badhaakar 5462 kar diya jayega
 By doing this it will become the largest hospital in the world
 iske liye 5500 karod kaa bajet rakhaa gaya
 Will be ready in four-five years
 yah bana to beograd ke sabase bade aspataal se aage nikal jayega
 There must have been an officer who understood b from Belgrade and b from Bihar and everyone would have enjoyed it
 isi bed ko agar aap puure bihar main baant dete to kai zilon main ek ek aspataal or ban jate
 For this, the old historical buildings of Patna Medical College will be demolished
 patna main piemsich ke alaava indira gandhi medical kalege bhi he jise ames kehete hai
 It has not become an alternative to AIIMS of Delhi till date
 yahaan bhi nitish kumaar ne isi june maheene main 500 bed kaa udghaatan kiya tha
 PMCH and AIIMS are enough for Patna
 ricard banane se acha hota 5462 bed ko puure bihar main baant dete to kisi ko saharsa or aara se patna nahin aana padataa
 But hospitals are also becoming like a fad of 300 feet statue
 phir bhi aap yah sawaal puch sakate hai ki 5462 bed ke aspataal ke liye 1500 doctor kahaan se laaoge
 There are less than 40% doctors in PMCH
 bihar main 5000 doctoron kii kami he
 Is Nitish Kumar going to increase medical seats in government colleges for this or is he preparing to earn by opening private medical colleges
 doctor sarkari medical kalege kyon jwine karegaa
 MBBS will pay a fee of one crore and PG in two crore, then why will he go to government college
 apane paise ko vasuul kahaan se karegaa
 You know that whoever passes through NEET is forced to go to these private colleges
 ghulaami kaa yah alag chakra he jise samaaj ne saharsha sweekaar kiya he
 Thanks to private colleges that one crore is taking only five years, otherwise this public could have given five crores without questioning the government
 shri krishna medical kalege main jo doctor saadhe chaar saal kii padhai ke baad internship kar rahe hai unhen dhai maheene se selary nahin mili he
 15000 rupees
 ho saktaa he puure bihar ke intern kii yahi haalat ho
 Obviously, the Bihar government will not have money
 to phir philhal aap sabhi janata 2500 bistar kii ghoshnaa se kaam chalaaiye
 National Cancer Institute NCI is being formed in Jhajjar, Haryana

 JP Nadda performs Bhoomi Pujan as Health Minister in late 2015
 aadharshila or bhumipujan main aap antar kar sakate hai
 On 23 October 2016 JP Nadda tweets that the hospital will be operational in 2018
 710 bed ke is aspataal ko ames kii nigaraanee main banwaaya ja rahaa he jise pradhanmantri karyaalay bhi monitor karata he
 When the OPD of this hospital was commissioned in December 2018, 710 beds were not known anywhere
 farvari 2019 main pradhanmantri modi jab iskaa udghaatan karte hai to 20 bed hi taiyaar tha
 Even today, beds are around 20
 chunaav kareeb tha, hedline lootni thi to elaan ho gaya
 When this hospital could not go beyond 20 beds in three years, could not make 710 beds, how many cancer patients die due to treatment expenses and debt, then Nitish Kumar will make 2500 beds
 1500 bed ek saal main banavaa denge
 In four years, 5462 bed hospital will be built in Patna
 puure rajya kaa swasthya bajet in do ghoshnaaon ko puraa karne main hi khap jayega

 muzffarpur kii janata yaa bihar kii janata jab ek campus main 30 se adhik bacchiyon ke saath hue balaatkaar par sadak par nahin ai to 130 bacchon kii maut par kyon aegi? ham maut ko bhavukta or aakrosh main badal rahe hai wo bhi ek do logon se aage nahin bad paa rahi he
 Can these questions based on facts make some changes? i do not know the answer to this

 Indian batsman KL Rahul said that he regretted that he missed a chance of decision review system (DRS) in the Asia Cup match against Afghanistan which could save the wickets of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Dinesh Karthik
 dhoni or karthik donon ko elbeadblyoo out diya gaya or agar bharat ke paas diares bachaa hota, to in donon ke khilaaf ampiron ko apane faisle palatney pad sakate the
 Rahul (60), however, used India's only review in which he had failed
 rahul ne kaha, ‘nishchit taur par lagata he ki mujhe tab diares nahin lenaa chahie tha, jab main krij par tha to mujhe laga ki gend baahar ja rahi thi or maine tisare ampire kii madad le lee,’ampiron kii galati par dhoni ne kaha, ‘jurmaana nahin bharna chahta hum’unhone kaha, ‘kai baar aap baad main samiksha pranali kii samiksha karte ho or tab lagata he ki aap ise baad ke khilaadiyon ke liye chhod sakate the,’ rahul ne kaha ki bhavishya main vah diares lene main adhik satarkta baratenge
 
 
 
 lekin par bhartiya phens rahul ko bakhshane ke mood main nahin hai
 The 26-year-old batsman is constantly criticized on Twitter

 com / wkdetlthco— Sir Ravindra Jadeja (@sirjadeja)september 25, 2018KL Rahul used the review when India was in a commanding position and he didn't seem confident
 So considering the match situation even if he didn't use his review India were in a good position
 But once the review is wasted then you lose the right to criticize the umpire
 - Apurv Danke (@apurvdanke) September 26, 2018KL Rahul played a fancy reverse sweep exposing middle & leg stumps, knowing that he was out wasted the review, as no reviews left Dhoni & Karthik both had to pay for POOR UMPIRING, Rayadu also thrown his wicket when he was set

 congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko adarsh ghotaale ke aaropee ashok chavaan se sammanit kiye jane par sawaal uthe hai
 The opposition in Maharashtra is asking why there is a difference between Rahul's words and actions on the issue of corruption? congress kii maharashtra ke aurangabad main hui raily ke dauraan party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa rajya ke purv mukhyamantri or adarsh ghotaale main aaropee ashok chavaan ne phulmala se swaagat kiya
 Rahul Gandhi, who arrived in Aurangabad to rally, was honored by Ashok Chavan
 chavaan ko congress ne adarsh ghotaale main daagdar hone kii vajah se mukhyamantri pad se hataa diya tha
 Moreover, Rahul had asked to accept the Adarsh commission report that is pointing towards Ashok Chavan
 is sab ke baavjood ashok chavaan ko saath bithakar rahul virodhiyon ko kos rahe the
 In this case, Leader of the Opposition BJP Vinod Tawde said that the Adarsh commission held Ashok Chavan guilty under Quid Pro Kyo
 us baavjood rahul gandhi un bhrashtachariyon ke haathon se swaagat kaa haar sweekaarte hai
 This shows that he wants to campaign with the corrupt

 idhar centre sarkaar ne kohinoor heere ke bare main supreme court main bataaya ki yah hira chori nahin hua tha, balki punjab ke maharaja ranjit singh ne ise angrejon ko tohfe main de diya tha, udhar odisha main heere ke malikana haq ko lekar halchal shuru ho gai
 According to the Odisha Congress claim, the will of Maharaja Ranjit Singh kept in the National Archives clearly states that Kohinoor should be donated to the Jagannath temple in Puri
 pradesh adhyaksh prasad harichandan kehete hai, “vasiyat kii durlabh prati mere paas he
 The Congress will launch a movement demanding the return of Kohinoor to India and in the first phase will send postcards from every district to the Prime Minister
 uske baad yachika bhi daayar kii ja sakati he
 There is a general belief in India that Kohinoor was stolen by the British
 lekin supreme court main janhit yachika par sunwaayee main solicytor general ranjit kumaar ne bataaya ki british hukumat ne na to kohinoor heere ko churaayaa tha or na hi ise ve jabardastee le gaye the
 Rather, Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Punjab gave gifts to the East India Company
 aisi sthiti main bharat sarkaar ise lene kaa daawa nahin kar sakati
 According to the government, Dilip Singh, the successor of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, had given the Kohinoor East India Company as compensation in the Sikh War of 1849
 haalanki solicytor general ne yah bhi kaha ki yah samskruti mantralay kii raay he or abhi videsh mantralay se jawaab aana baaki he
 After this, the top court has given six weeks to file the reply
 isse kuch samay pehle is mudde par britain main bhartiya mul ke saansad kith vaaj kaa bayaan bhi surkhiyon main rahaa tha jisamen unhone kaha tha ki “kohinoor hira bharat ko lautaa dena chahie
 "vaj's statement came after a speech by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in which he said that Britain should pay compensation to rule India for 200 years
" tharur ne yah bhaashan oxford vishvavidhyalay main diya tha jisamen unhone kaha tha ki nakad harjaana dena jatil or lambii prakriya hogi jiskaa koi khaas matlab nahin hoga
 Even then, a unique thing like Kohinoor diamond can be given back
 tharur ke is bhaashan kii pradhanmantri modi ne bhi tarif kii thi
 But now the government's stand on Kohinoor has changed
 harichandan kehete hai, “maharaja ranjit singh kii vasiyat ko aadhaar banaakar hi nirnay liya janaa chahie
 He was the owner of Kohinoor and his wish, as it is also written in the will, was to donate it to the Jagannath temple
 isliye kohinoor ko odisha laayaa janaa chahie
 “india is not the only country claiming this diamond
 1976 main pakistan ke pradhanmantri julfikar ali bhutto ne tatkaaleen british pradhanmantri james kalaghan se ise unke desh ko lautaane kaa anurodh kiya tha
 Apart from this, Afghanistan and Iran have also claimed this
 kohinoor ko abhishpt hira mana jaataa he
 According to the legends, the diamond, which it reached, waved its glory in the beginning but it also ended badly
 hira aane ke baad britain ke rajpariwaar ko bhi kai museebaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 It reached the Mughal ruler Babur from various rulers of Delhi Sultanate
 isse pehle yah hira kakatiya vansh ke paas tha
 The Kohinoor diamond is also mentioned in Baburnama
 mana jaataa he ki kohinoor hira vartmaan bharat ke andhra pradesh ke guntur jile main sthit golkunda kii khadaanon se niklaa tha
 Kohinoor diamond could never be valued at any cost, because it has not sold even once in its entire history
 yaa to ek raja ne duusare raja se ise jeeta yaa phir yah inaam main diya gaya
 However, its price can be gauged from the fact that a diamond 4 in Hong Kong 60 years ago
 6 karod dollar main bika tha, jo 24
 78 carats while Kohinoor 105
 6 carat kaa he
 Currently, this diamond is part of the crown of Queen Elizabeth II

 But when Shivpal refused to listen, Gayatri Prajapati presented the sword and shawl to the Chief Minister in his place
 4
 Both Shivpal Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav were enjoying themselves while waving their swords, and they cheered and whistled
 5
 The funniest view of the entire rally was when Lalu Yadav pulled both Shivpal and Akhilesh along and stood next to him
 jab donon ne apane haath main pakadi talwaar ko hawa main upar karke laharaaya to bheed ne khub taaliyaan bajaai
 6
 shivpal yadav ne khub imotional bhaashan diya or kaha ki vah harkurbaaniko taiyaar hai or yahaan tak ki khun bhi dene ko taiyaar hai
 Akhilesh Yadav took restraint in replying but said so much that the socialists presented him with a sword and wanted the sword not to go

 There were many such old stalwarts of the Janata Parivar who always fought among themselves and could never become one
 lekin akhilesh or shivpal ko jhagada bhuulakar ek hone kii naseehat dene main koi kisi se peeche nahin rahanaa chahta tha

 He said that the Commission's current methodology of poverty criteria is beyond reality and cannot be the same for all areas

 Can we not make it a yardstick? Singh's statement came at a time when Sibal had a day earlier challenged the Planning Commission's way of assessing poverty, saying that a family of five members could not live for Rs 5000 per month

 This Ram is a theater actor and director by profession, and plays Ravana in his play
 
 
 ek din use raste main achaanak miltaa he mandaar lele, yani kunal roy kapur, jo khudakushi karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 
 
 Ram saves her from committing suicide and brings her home
 
 
 iske baad ram koshish karata he, use uski patni se milaane kii, or uski zindagi main khushiyaan waapas laane kii
 
 
 But he gets caught on his own in this attempt
 
 
 kahani acchhee he, or rohan sippi ne use behad alag andaaz main kehane kii koshish kii he, lekin lagata he, vah script taiyaar karne main maat kha gaye
 
 
 Looking at the promos of 'nautanki Saala' it seemed that maybe it would be a comedy film, but in reality it plays on a completely different track
 
 
 haa, kuch-kuch jagah yah aapako hansaa sakati he
 
 
 The comments isamen koi shaq nahin ki film ko alag banane kii koshish kii gai he, lekin apni gati se chalate kuch seen film ko dhilaa bana dete hai
 
 
 Finding the real life in the pages of Ramayana, the director has revealed a new thing, but the benefit will be only when the audience can understand it
 
 
 haa, ramayana ke seen, costum, or lits film ko khubasurat banaate hai

 yahaan main ayushmaan kii naatak company ke produsar sanjeev bhatta kii tarif bhi zarur karnaa chaahunga, jinhone acha abhinay kiya he
 
 
 There is a pause in the film, but sometimes it can make you feel bored
 
 
 kuch puraane gaanon ke ri−mix aapako sunne main achche lag sakate hai
 
 
 Overall my rating for this film is - 3 stars
 
 
 yah ram peshey se ek theatre actor or diarector he, or apane naatak main ravan kaa kirdaar nibhaataa he
 
 
 One day he suddenly meets Mandar Lele, ie Kunal Roy Kapur, who is trying to commit suicide
 
 
 ram use khudakushi karne se bachaata he or apane ghar le aata he
 
 
 Ram then tries to reconcile him to his wife, and bring happiness back to his life
 
 
 lekin is koshish main vah khud hi funs jaataa he
 
 
 The story is good, and Rohan Sippy tries to say it in a very different way, but he seems to have failed to produce the script
 
 
 'nautanki saalaa' ke promo dekhakar lag rahaa tha ki shaayad yah kamedi film hogi, lekin asal main yah bilkul alag trek par chalati he
 
 
 Yes, it can make you laugh at some places
 
 
 tippaniyan There is no doubt that an attempt has been made to make the film different, but at its own pace, some scenes make the film loose
 
 
 asal zindagi ko ramayana ke pannon main dhundte diarector ne ek nai baat to saamne rakhi he, lekin phayda tab hoga, jab darshak ise samaj paaen
 
 
 Yes, the scenes, costume, and lights of Ramayana make the film beautiful
 
 
 ayushmaan khurana achche hai, lekin kunal roy kapur kaa abhinay saraahneey he
 
 
 Here i would also like to praise Sanjeev Bhatt, the producer of Ayushmann's drama company, who has done well
 
 
 film main tehraav he, lekin kahin-kahin vah aapako ubaau lag saktaa he
 
 
 Re-mixes of some old songs may sound good to you

 The police involved in the investigation of Sheena Bora murder case has found many important evidence
 rishton ke jaal main fanse is cese kii karte tak khulani shuru huin jab june ke pehle hafte main mumbai police kamishnar rakesh maaria ko ek gumnaam phone aata he
 There was a girl to call, this girl was probably Sheena's friend
 vah phone par rakesh maaria ko bataati he ki shina bora naam kii ek ladki katin saal pehle katlho chukaa he or use shaq nahin balki yakeen he ki katl usee kii maa indrani mukherjee ne kiya he
 She also states that Indrani Mukherjee's husband's name is Peter Mukherjee, a big man
 itnaa hi nahin voindrani mukherjee ke ghar kaa patabhi bataati he
 She then disconnects the phone
 sabase bharosemand saathi ko saunpi jaancharakesh maaria is khabar ko sunne ke baad sabase pehle khaar police stesan se shina naam kii kisi ladki ke bare main jaankaree maangate hai, lekin thane main teen saal pehle hui aisi kisi vaardaat kii koi khabar nahin thi
 By now Rakesh Maria was convinced that the caller was telling the truth
 isi ke baad unhone apane sabase bharosemand inspector dinesh kadam ko maamle kii jaanch karne kii jimmedaari saunpi lekin is hidaayat ke saath ki aisi kisi jaanch kii bhanak kisi ko na lage
 Dinesh Kadam first started secretly collecting information about Indrani Mukherjee and Peter Mukherjee
 indrani ke varli ke ghar, ghar ke sadasyon ke bare main puri chaanbin kii topahali baar unhen pataa chalaaki shina naam kii ek ladki jo indrani kii bahan he ghar main aksar aati jaati rahati thi lekin pichley teen saalon se uskaa koi ata-pataa nahin he
 It was learned that the connection of the driver Dinesh Kadam and his team was investigating the matter in such a way that the Mukherjee family had no doubt but it was difficult to find out the truth without talking to the family or the family members
 isi ke baad jaanch ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki kuch saal pehle tak shyamvar raay naam kaa ek driver indrani kii gaadi chalaata tha
 The police somehow found the Bride
 uske baad uskaa lagaataar peechha kiya jane laga, saath hi uske mobile ko bhi servilans par laga diya lekin in donon chizon se hi cese aage nahin bad rahaa tha
 Eventually the police decided to arrest Shyamvar but the danger was one, when Shyamvar was being monitored, Indrani Mukherjee was outside the country
 police ko shaq tha ki raay kii giraftaar kii khabar milane par shaayad wo desh hi na lauten
 That is why the police decided to wait for Indrani to return to the country
 kyonki maamla hai profile tha lihaaja maaria koi risk lenaa nahin chaahate the isliye unhone is dauraan apane sabase bharosemand inspector dinesh kadam kaa tabadalaa khaar police thane main kar diya
 Along with this, another trusted senior inspector Datate Bhargude was also sent to Khar police station
 iske alaava apane bharosemand asipi sanjay kadam ko bhi khaar thane se jod diya
 All three officers have been with Rakesh's Maria since the early stages and have even been involved in the 26 / 11 investigation
 driver ne ye sunakar ugal diya katl kaa sachek roj khabar milti he ki indrani mumbai laut ain
 Police picks up Shyamvar Rai as soon as he gets the news
 giraftaar arms act ke tahat dikhaai jaati he
 He is then interrogated
 use daraaya jaataa he ki arms act main sanjay dutt bhi jail jane se nahin bache isliye shina ke katl kaa sach bataa do
 Opinion soon breaks down against the strictness of the police and then he spends the entire story of 24 April 2012
 police ko uske bayaan par ab bhi yakeen nahin tha
 Rakesh Maria did not want to take the risk of arresting Indrani Mukherjee only on the statement of the driver, so first of all decided to testify Rai's statement
 isi ke baad shyamvar raay ko raigarh ke us jangal main le jaaya gaya jahaan usne shina kii laash ko jalaane or dafnane kii baat kahi thi
 The police gets some human bones from Rai's stated location
 iske baad raigarh police se ye bhi pataa chal jaataa he ki 23 may 2012 ko thik usee jagah se ek mahila kii jali hui or buree haalat main laash mili thi
 Finally, Indrani Christian Bones, despite the statements of Raigad police and the confession of Rai, the police still did not want to lay hands on Indrani Mukherjee and was looking for some more evidence and finally found these evidence of Shyamvar Rai, Indrani Mukherjee and Sanjeev Khanna 24 From April 2012 phone location

 rahul ko chhod kar police ke saamne cese kaa har kirdaar maujuud tha or iske baad police ne shina murder cese se jude har shaks se poochtacha kii
 Police are looking for answers to these questions, currently Mumbai Police is trying to find out what was the motive of Sanjeev Khanna in Sheena Rudder case? When both were divorced, then why did Sanjeev Khanna help Indrani in killing Sheena? Did Indrani hatch any conspiracy before killing Sheena? Did Sanjeev Khanna know about Indrani's first marriage? Did she know that Indrani has two children from her first marriage? According to sources, Sanjeev Khanna has confessed to the police interrogation that the day Sheena was killed was present in Mumbai
 haalanki uskaa or indrani se talaak ho chukaa tha lekin phir bhi donon ke bich akasar baatcheet hua karti thi or isaki sabase badi vajah thi donon kii beti vidhi, jo apni maa ke saath rahati he
 Did Sanjeev not really know this? According to police sources, Sanjeev Khanna has told the police that Indrani always kept a photo of two children with her and she replied when asked that both of her younger siblings Huh
 agar sanjeev khanna sach kah rahaa he to iskaa sidhaa sa matlab nikalataa he ki khud sanjeev khanna ko nahin pataa tha ki jis shina ko voindrani kii bahansamajhataa he asal main wo indrani kii beti he
 That is, Indrani Mukherjee had hidden the truth of her first marriage and two children to her second husband Sanjeev Khanna

 Even after a year has passed, the police have not taken any action
 artiai kaaryakarta asad patel kaa aarope he ki ek taraf police koi karrwai nahin kar rahi he, duusari taraf unhen cese waapas lene ke liye dhamkaaya ja rahaa he
 They are planning to knock the court door again in this case

 whatsapp has a large number of users around the world, but is their data safe
 haal hi main ek report pesh kii gai he jise pard kar aapaki ankhen khul jaaengi
 This report states that all the data of whatsapp claiming end-to-end encryption is within the reach of the government

 According to the news published in The Telegraph, this is stated in the Annual Report of the Digital Rights Group's Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
 and-tu-and inkripshan hone ke baavjood whatsap ko 2 star reating diya gaya he
 The report released this week said that whatsapp does not clearly make clear that no third party has access to the user's data
 na hi ye kahati he ki kisi third party ko servilans uddeshyon se yujar ke data ke istemaal ke liye bain kiya gaya he
 The report claims the Internet privacy campaigner that Facebook-owned whatsapp has not taken enough steps to protect its data from governments from users, and the app has also failed to control messages sent by criminals
 EFF ke anual report is baat par aadhaarit he ki kaise companiyaan apane yugers ke data par sarkari niyamon ke saath deal karti hai
 Companies are given 0-5 stars keeping in mind various things, including whether customers have information about the government's request
 whatsap ke saath saath amejan ko bhi keval 2 star hi die gaye hai
 a genuine question arises from this report that if governments are able to read whatsapp messages then they can monitor every aspect of activist, journalist and their citizens
 kyonki hamaari lagbhag jaankariyaan aajkar online uplabdh hoti hai
 Like, who is talking to whom, where is he going, whom is he meeting, whom is he from, what political party belongs to everything
