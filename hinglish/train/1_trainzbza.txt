kaise padhegaa
 The Subordinate Service Selection Board of Punjab Government has issued a notification that on April 8, the questions will be answered on the website
 kisi chaatr ko agar koi jawaab galat lagata he to use ek farm bharna hoga
 a draft of Rs 590 will have to be sent to fill the form
 agar chaatr kaa daawa sahi niklaa to paise waapas or nahin niklaa to paise rakh liye jaaenge
 The format of this form states that if any one question is wrong, then all the students will have to make different claims by making a draft of 590
 ek ke daawey karne se yaa chunauti dene sabake badale kaa daawa nahin mana jayega
 If so, it is terrible
 saraasar lut he
 It should be done that if a student questions that a particular question paper is wrong, then the commission itself should tell whether its claim is true or false
 kahin aisa to nahin ki paisa kamaane ke liye har pariksha main do chaar sawaal is tarah vivaadit rup se chhod die ja rahe hai kyonki ab aisi kai parikshaayen aapako desh bhar main milengi jinamein ek se lekar 15 or kabhi kabhi 40 prashn galat hote hai
 The CBSE Class 10 math exam date has troubled students in many ways
 maanav sansaadhan mantri ko dasvin or 12veen ke baad hone vaali parikshaon kii tarikhon ke bare main bhi nae sire se faisla karnaa hoga

 Ravish sir, main aniket saurav (sitamarhi bihar se) ek 10veen kaa chaatr hum
 i am taking the exam
 jab main 10veen kaa ganit kaa paper dekar ghar aayaa to pataa chalaa ki pariksha radd ho gai he or shaayad nai pariksha 26 april ko he
 i have filled the form of Banaras Hindu School
 iske liye 406 rupee kaa farm bharaa he
 a ticket of Rs 470 has been taken for the train from Patna to Banaras
 main 23 ko jaakar 24 ko banaras kaa train pakadta hum to meri pariksha chhot jaaegi
 My dream is broken Ravish sir, to study in an outside college, parents cannot teach in expensive universities
 mere jaise bahut bacchon kaa sapana tut gaya he
 Now if the Prime Minister expresses sorrow, what benefit? kaaphi dukhi hum, kuch bhi karne main man nahin lag rahaa he
 If you can ask BHU to extend the date, it would be a great blessing
 aniket saurabh, sitamarhi bihar If this is the case, then these things should be brought immediately to the notice of HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar so that students are not debarred from appearing in other entrance examinations due to cancellation of examination
 aap jaanate hai ki banaras hindu vidhyalay bhi biechayu kaa hi hissaa he
 Here the entrance exam for 11th
 aisi kitni parikshaayen kahaan kahaan hoti hai, hamen pataa bhi nahin magar maanav sansaadhan mantri chahenge to chaatro ko badi raahat mil sakati he
 On March 30, Anil Swarup, Education Secretary, Government of India, appeared in front of the press and said that the Mathematics examination of class x would be held in July
 agar radd hogi to sirf haryana or dilli ke kshetra ke liye kii jaaegi
 Economics exam will be held on 25 April
 kis july ko hogi iskaa faisla karne main abhi 15 din or lagenge
 The Education Secretary says that complaints come but cannot cancel the examination on the basis of every complaint
 yah baat sahi he magar isse yah jawaab nahin miltaa ki jo shikaayat ai us par kya ection liya gaya
 Today a student has surfaced, claiming that he had written a letter to the Prime Minister's Office on March 17, but no one took care
 maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne bhi mana he ki prashn patr ko chhapane se lekar pahunchane ke bich kai charan hote hai
 Hence the risk of leaks increases
 kam se kam unhone mana to
 Now saying that it has to be fixed
 vahiin purv maanav sansaadhan mantri kapil sibbal maang kar rahe hai ki pradhanmantri chaatro se maafee maangen magar sibbal kaa sawaal kuch or he
 They are saying that now only one question paper is for the whole country, it has become easier to leak
 tippaniyan The government should do one more thing
 isamen naagarik uddyan mantri or rail mantri kii bhoomika ho sakati he
 That is, CBSE students can withdraw their full ticket money by showing their admit card
 bahut se maa baap aise hai jinhone pariksha khatm hone ke baad bharat main or bharat ke baahar ghoomane ke liye tikat kataaya tha
 If you cancel now, it may cost them between 40 thousand and 1 lakh
 chunki galati sarkaar kii he isliye sarkaar ko hi isaki bharpai kerani chahie
 The dock media, which wants to leave the basic questions of education and entice you into Hindu Muslim Tibet, is now improving its image on the pretext of CBSE
 wo paper li kii khabaron ko aise kar rahaa he jaise use bahut chintaa he
 Had he worried, he would have also raised the questions raised by the students of the Staff Selection Commission
 madhya pradesh main lokseva ayog kii pariksha ko lekar jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai unki bhi baat karata, vahaan patawaari kii pariksha ko lekar samasya he
 From there, students are writing that a private company has conducted the examination of Patwari
 jinke kam number hai ve safal hai or jinke zyaada hai ve fail hai
 When will we take all these things seriously? isi tarah chaatr naukariyon or pariksha ko lekar bengal main bhi pradarshan kar rahe hai, upi main bhi rose pradarshan hote hai, or punjab main bhi
 It is the background of CBSE students that got so much attention or else they also understand what is the situation in the country regarding education system
 ve 12veen to paas kar jaaenge magar uske baad college kaisaa milegaa
 Will everyone have to keep coming to Delhi and Mumbai only? bhopal or patna main aisa college kyon nahin he ki koi dilli se vahaan bhej de
 My questions are basic and important
 2019 main koun jitegaa se pehle yah poochna zaruri he ki hamaara aapkaa baccha kahaan padhegaa
 How to read kaayade se yah hona chahie ki agar koi chaatr sawaal karata he ki falaan prashn patr galat he, to ayog ko khud hi bataanaa chahie ki uskaa daawa sahi he yaa galat
 Is it not that in order to earn money, two or four questions are being disputed in every exam like this, because now you will find many such exams across the country in which one to 15 questions and sometimes 40 questions are wrong
 sibiesai kii dasvin kii ganit kii pariksha kii taarikh ne chaatro ko kai tareeke se pareshaan kiya he
 The HR Minister will also have to decide afresh on the dates of examinations to be held after the tenth and 12th
 bihar ke sitamarhi se dasvin ke ek chaatr ne patr likhaa he jo is samasya main ek nayaa aayam jodta he
 You also study
 
 
 raveesh sar, i am Aniket Saurav (from Sitamarhi Bihar) a 10th standard student
 main pariksha de rahaa hum
 When i came home with a math paper of 10th, it came to know that the exam has been canceled and the new exam is probably on 26th of April
 maine banaras hindu vidhyalay kaa farm bharaa he
 For this, a form of 406 rupees is filled
 patna se banaras kii train ke liye 470 rupee kaa tikat liya he
 If i go to 23 and catch a train to Benares on 24, then i will miss my exam
 meraa sapana tut gaya raveesh sar, baahar ke college main padhane kaa, maa baap mahangi uniwarsity main nahin padhaa sakate hai
 The dream of many children like me is broken
 ab agar pradhanmantri dukh zaahir bhi karte hai to kya faaydaa
 i am very sad, i do not feel like doing anything
 kya aap biechayu ko date aage badhaane ke liye kah sakate hai to badi krupa hogi
 Aniket Saurabh, Sitamarhi Bihar agar aisa he to maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ke dhyaan main in baton ko turant laayaa janaa chahie taaki pariksha radd hone ke kaaran chaatro ko duusari pravesh parikshaon main shaamil hone se vanchit na hona pade
 You know that Banaras Hindu School is also a part of BHU
 yahaan 11veen ke liye pravesh pariksha hoti he
 We do not even know how many such examinations take place, but if the HR Minister wants, then the students can get great relief
 30 march ko bharat sarkaar ke shiksha sachiv anil swaroop press ke saamne aae or unhone kaha ki dasvin kii ganit kii pariksha july main hogi
 If canceled, it will be done only for the areas of Haryana and Delhi
 arthshaastra kii pariksha 25 april ko hogi
 It will take 15 more days to decide on which July will take place
 shiksha sachiv kehete hai ki shikaayatein aati hai magar har shikaayat ke aadhaar par pariksha radd nahin kar sakate hai
 This is true, but it does not give an answer as to what action was taken on the complaint that came
 aaj ek chaatr saamne aayaa he, wo daawa kar rahaa he ki 17 march ko hi usne pradhanmantri karyaalay ko patr likh diya tha magar kisi ne dhyaan nahin rakhaa
 Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar has also admitted that there are several stages between printing and sending a question paper
 isliye li kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 At least they believed
 ab kah rahe hai ki ise thik karnaa hoga
 At the same time, former HRD Minister Kapil Sibal is demanding that the Prime Minister apologize to the students, but Sibal's question is something else
 wo kah rahe hai ki ab sirf ek hi prashn patr puure desh ke liye hota he, isse li hona aasaan ho gaya he
 The comments sarkaar ko ek kaam or karnaa chahie
 It can have the role of Minister of Civil Aviation and Minister of Railways
 wo yah ki sibiesai ke chaatr apana admit card dikhaakar tikat kaa puraa paisa waapas le sakate hai
 There are many parents who had ticketed to travel in India and outside India after the examination is over
 ab cancil karaayenge to unhen 40 hazaar se lekar 1 lakh tak kaa chuunaa lag saktaa he
 Since the fault is with the government, the government should make up for it
 godi media jo shiksha ke buniyadi sawaalon ko chhod kar hindu muslim tibet main aapako fansaa kar rakhana chahta he aaj kal sibiesai ke bahaane apni chhavi sudhaar rahaa he
 He is doing the news of paper leak as if he is very worried
 chintaa hoti to vah staff salection kamishan ke chaatro ne jo sawaal uthaae use bhi uthaata
 In Madhya Pradesh also talks about the students who are agitating for the Public Service Commission examination, there is a problem with the examination of Patwari
 vahaan se chaatr likh rahe hai ki patawaari kii pariksha ek privet company ne karai he
 Those who have fewer numbers are successful and those who have more are failed
 in sab baton ko ham kab gambhirtha se lenge
 Similarly, students are performing in Bengal for jobs and examinations, daily demonstrations are also held in UP, and also in Punjab
 sibiesai ke chaatro kii prishthbhumi hi he ki itnaa dhyaan mil gaya varanaa wo bhi samajhen ki shiksha vyavastha ko lekar kya haalat he desh main
 They will pass the 12th but after that how will college be
 kya sabko dilli or mumbai hi aate rahanaa hoga
 Why is there no such college in Bhopal and Patna to send someone from Delhi
 mere sawaal buniyadi hai or zaruri
 Before who wins in 2019, it is important to ask where our child will study
 kaise padhegaa

 How to read argentina ke diggaj khilaadi leonnelle mesi ke baad putargaal ke karishmai farward christiano ronaldo kaa fifa world cap jeetne kaa sapana bhi adhuraa rah gaya
 Messi-led Argentina suffered defeat against France while Portugal, playing under Ronaldo, were defeated 2–1 by Uruguay in the pre-quarterfinal match played late on Saturday
 urugve ke liye star farward edinson kavani ne do gol kiye jabaki maujuuda europea champion portugal ke liye ekmaatr gol pepe ne kiya
 Edinson became man of the match
 fisht stadium main khele gaye is mukaable main donon tiimon ne majboot shuruaati kii lekin star farward kavani or louis suarej kii jugalbandi ke kaaran urugve match kaa pehla gol karne main kaamyaab rahaa
 In the seventh minute of the match, Suarez delivered a superb cross into the box from the right end on which Kavani scored a header from the header to give Uruguay a 1-0 lead
 portugal ne ek gol se pichhadane ke baad bhi apana sanyam nahin khoyaa
 Portugal's corner in the 11th minute was defended by defender José Fonte but he was unable to put the ball into the goal

 About a year ago, the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme was started to save the farmers from the problem of crop wastage in the country
 yah zamin par kis tarah se lagu ho rahi he ye dekhne ke liye main haryana ke jhajjar zile ke gaanv pahunchaa
 First i reached the village of Chudani
 praveen kumaar 3 acre main kheti karte hai
 There is a complaint that if the Kisan Credit Card was made for agriculture, the bank insured and deducted the premium money despite insuring it
 praveen ke mutabik- maine krishi card banwaaya he
 Last time my money was forcibly deducted, but i refused, yet again this time deducted money
 vijay kumaar kaa pichley sijan main bank ne jabaran beemaa kiya, lekin makka or kapaas kii fasal kharaab hone ke baavjood jab clem kaa paisa nahin mila to is baar bank ko beemaa ke liye manaa kiya, lekin bank ne phir bhi janvari main premium kaa paisa kaat liya
 Vijay told, i came direct and said that Sir, my agriculture card should not deduct money
 main beemaa nahin karwaanaa chahta
 Had it been done last time, if nothing was found then what is the benefit phir bhi jabardastee kar diya
 He had then said that if not done, then close the agricultural card, now tell me how to get the card closed? yahi nahin fasal beemaa karte vaqt bank ko ye tak nahin pataa ki kisaan ne fasal koun-si lagaai he
 Farmer Sudhir said that we have planted the bajra crop but the bank has insured our paddy
 tippaniyan Farmer Krishna Chandra Deshwal of Dulhera, a village nearby, called for a claim in the insurance company after the 4-acre paddy was damaged in August, but till date, forget the insurance amount
 krishna chandra deshvaal ke mutabik- isiaisiai lombard main phone kiya to unhone kaha ki puure gaanv kii fasal kharaab hogi to survey kiya jayega akele kaa nahin kiya jayega
 When the bank reached the outside, the poster wrote that insurance is compulsory on taking a loan with Kisan Credit Card
 bank manager harish makhija ne bataaya ki guidelins ye hai ki jisko krishi card milegaa usko beemaa karnaa hoga
 There are two or three questions in this story
 pehla yah ki beemaa aagrah kii vastu he yani kisaan kii sahmati ke bina beemaa karke uske khate se premium kaa paisa jabaran kaise kaata ja saktaa he? doosraa bank beemaa kare to us fasal kaa kare jo kisaan ne boi he
 And thirdly, if the farmer gets the insurance money in case of crop failure, otherwise what is the benefit of this crop insurance scheme? vijay kumaar kaa pichley sijan main bank ne jabaran beemaa kiya, lekin makka or kapaas kii fasal kharaab hone ke baavjood jab clem kaa paisa nahin mila to is baar bank ko beemaa ke liye manaa kiya, lekin bank ne phir bhi janvari main premium kaa paisa kaat liya

 krishna chandra deshvaal ke mutabik- isiaisiai lombard main phone kiya to unhone kaha ki puure gaanv kii fasal kharaab hogi to survey kiya jayega akele kaa nahin kiya jayega

 And thirdly, if the farmer gets the insurance money in case of crop failure, otherwise what is the benefit of this crop insurance scheme? vijay ne bataaya, main diarect jaakar kahkar aayaa tha ki sar mere krishi card se paise nahin katane chahie
 i do not want insurance
 pichhali baar karaayaa tha to kuch nahin mila to ab kya phayda
 Still forced
 unhone tabhi kah diya tha ki nahin karwaanaa to krishi card band karvaa do apana ab aap bataaie card kaise band karvaa den? Not only this, while doing crop insurance, the bank does not even know what crop the farmer has planted
 kareeb 6 acre main kheti karne kisaan sudhir ne bataaya ki ji hamane fasal to bajre kii lagaai lekin bank ne beemaa hamaara dhan kaa kar diya
 The comments paas hi ke gaanv dulheda ke kisaan krishna chandra deshvaal ne 4 acre dhan agast main kharaab hone par beemaa company main clem ke liye phone kiya lekin aaj tak survey nahin hua beemaa kii rakam bhul jaaie
 According to Krishna Chandra Deshwal- ICICI made a call in Lombard, he said that if the crops of the entire village are bad then the survey will be done alone
 bank pahunchaa to baahar hi poster likhaa tha ki kisaan credit card se lone lene par beemaa anivaary he
 Bank manager Harish Makhija said that the guidelines are that whoever gets the agriculture card will have to be insured
 is kahani main do teen sawaal hai
 The first is that insurance is the object of solicitation, ie how can a farmer forcibly deduct premium money from his account without his consent? If the second bank insures, then do the crop that the farmer has sown
 or teesraa kisaan ko fasal kharaab hone par bime kaa paisa to mili varanaa is fasal beemaa yojana kaa phayda kya hua? Not only this, while doing crop insurance, the bank does not even know what crop the farmer has planted

 The BJP and other opposition parties have been demanding his removal from the cabinet ever since the CBI lodged an FIR against Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav
 bihar ke purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi ne ab is maamle main nitish kumaar kii chuppi par kadaa bayaan diya he
 Manjhi said, Nitish Kumar had shown me the way out of the cabinet within five days, then why are you not excluding Tejashwi Yadav
 darasal varsh 2005 menjitanram maanjainithish kumaar ke mantrimandal main shaamil hue the
 Manjhi was accused of corruption in the 90s as a minister of education in the then RJD government
 aise main jab nitish sarkaar main unhen mantri banaae jane par vivaad hua, to siem nitish ne turant hi unase istipha le liya tha
 However, later he was acquitted of these allegations and then Nitish Kumar also added him back to his cabinet
 baad main nitish kumaar ne unhen rajya kaa mukhyamantri bhi banaaya
 Besides Manjhi, Nitish Kumar had also sent Ramanand Prasad Singh away from the cabinet on this basis
 tab aisa kaha gaya ki siem nitish apane mantrimandal main daagi chehron ko nahin dekhnaa chaahate
 In such a situation, keeping in mind his previous decisions on CM Nitish, there is an effort to pressure Tejashwi Yadav to be removed from the cabinet soon
 haalanki yahaan argedy kaa kahana he ki yah maamla bhrashtachar kaa nahin, balki raajnneetik dwesh kaa he or sajeesh ke tahat unke khilaaf FIR kiya gaya he
 RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav says that at the time of this being said, Tejashwi was a minor and a child was made an accused
 vahiin ek tark yah bhi diya ja rahaa he kitejasvi yadavake khilaaf abhi sirf exiaar darj hui he, vah chargeshited nahin hai
 In such a situation, there is not going to be any decision against them at the moment
 vahiin kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki jab uma bharti chargeshited hokar kendriya mantrimandal main rah sakati hai, to phir tejasvi kyon nahin rah sakate
 However, experts believe that the way Nitish has kept silence on this whole matter, it seems that he will take a rational decision

 Veerappa Moily said that Siddaramaiah has brought the state forward on the path of development
 unhone kaha ki rajya ke vikaas ke liye jin yojanaayen kaa elaan kiya gaya unhen puraa kiya gaya he

In the next few years, i am going to give employment to 5 lakh youth, is it good or bad work? Giving milk and yogurt to people of the country at a low price, is it good or bad work? And whatever profit will be given to charity, is it good work or bad work? In Aaj Tak's program Halla Bol, Baba Ramdev said that companies like Colgate earn here and take all the money to their country

 The Bombay High Court, while relieving Kings XI Punjab, stayed the Cricket Board's cancellation of the contract of this IPL franchise
 nyaayamurti esaje vajifadar ne kaha ki dastavejon ko dekhte hue kings ilevan kaa daawa majboot lagata he
 The dispute will now go to the new tribunal, as BN Srikrishna, who was earlier playing the role of the arbitrator, distanced himself from the hearing
 kings ilevan haalanki janvari main hone vaali khilaadiyon kii nilaamee main hissaa le paaegaa
 Kings XI, however, will have to provide bank guarantees to compensate for the potential loss to BCCI and the franchise if the arbitration decision goes against Kings XI
 nyaayamurti vajifadar ne saath hi kaha ki kings ilevan ko khilaadiyon ke ipel ke pichley satr ke lambit vetan kaa bhi bhugtan karnaa hoga
 He said, "it is a question of national prestige
 ’’ gauratlab he ki bisisiai or rajasthan rails ke bich vivaad main panchat kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale nyaayamurti shrikrishna ne bhi pratham drushtya rails kaa qaraar radd karne ko gaiyrkanoonee bataaya tha
 The court also recorded Kings XI counsel Dolis Khambata's statement that the shareholding pattern of the owners would not change and the shares would not be sold without the approval of the court or tribunal
 team ke maalikon main abhinetri priti jinta or udyogpati ness wadiya shaamil hai
 Defending the decision to cancel the contract, the BCCI said that if the ownership pattern of Kings XI has been changed without the consent of the Cricket Board, there is a violation of the key rule of the agreement
 board ne kings ilevan ko nirdesh diya he ki vah nilaamee main chune jane vaale khilaadiyon ke liye ek karod 80 lakh dollars or bisisiai ke liye 35 lakh dollars kii bank guarantee ek maheene ke andar jamaa karaaye
 The BCCI wanted this guarantee, as it feared that it would lose revenue if it replaced Kings XI as a franchise and failed to conduct a new auction
 kings ilevan puraane khilaadiyon ko team ke saath barkaraar rakhane ke liye aaj kii samay-seemaa ko bhi badhwaana chahta tha, lekin adaalat ne uski is yachika par faisla dene se inkaar kar diya

 It is half past eight in the night, the team has gone off to rest from Anna's stage
 lekin manch ke neeche logon kaa jamaavada kam nahin ho rahaa
 At the bottom of the stage, a woman activist of India Against Corruption is discussing Anna's political choice with her partner
 tabhi vahaan yuvaaon kii bheed lag jaati he or khuli bahes shuru ho jaati he
 Female activist says, "if you think that Rahul Gandhi can get rid of people like Mulayam Singh, then brother it won't be like this
" raajnneeti kii gandi fasal ko saaf karnaa hi he
 
 
 One has to jump into battle once

 "then three young men arrive in the group

 team anna kii bhrashtachar ke khilaaf majboot kanoon (jan lokapal) kii maang se shuru hua jan andolan ab sidhe rajnatik jang ke liye uth khadaa hua he
 With this, the team has started talking about changing the system, going much further than Anna Lokpal

 The opportunity will not come again, we do not have to lose this opportunity
 '' anshan par 10 din se baithe kejariwal ke josh or jazbe main koi fark nahin padaa
 He shouts, "now the future belongs to India
" agle teen saal ke andar bharat badalegaa or bhrashtacharmukt hokar rahegaa
 We have to show it by fighting elections without money

 The team has not decided the name of the party yet, but so far 90 to 95 percent of the supporters in the opinion polls have justified the decision of political choice
 team anna ne ummidavaaron ke chayan se lekar ghoshnaa patr banane ke taur-tareekon or satta main aane ke baad ke agenda kaa bhi elaan kar diya he
 There are issues such as Janlokpal and Right to Reject legislation, taking only a quarter of the salary of mps-mlas, taking allowance during travel, stopping use of red lights within three months of coming to power
 rajnatik safar par nikalne kaa faisla kar chuki team anna ko is baat kaa bakhubi ehsaas he ki raajnneeti kii dagar itani aasaan nahin or sarkaar ke ahankaar or akkhadpan kii vajah se hi ve rajnatik vikalp kii ore bade hai
 This is the reason why Arvind Kejriwal and Anna Hazare themselves broke the fast and announced, "within the next two years i
e
 before the 2014 general elections, if the UPA government wants the Jan Lokpal bill, the right to recall and dismiss the people's representatives
" Pass the Recall and Right to Reject legislation, we will withdraw the initiative of political choice

 Singh publicly opened a front against the government for the first time since retirement
 anna ke manch se unhone kaha, ''desh dishaheen ho chukaa he
 Governance and law and order have collapsed

 "with this bet, Team Anna has intensified the political fragrance
" congress kii ore se digvijay singh or sarkaar kii ore se ambika soni sareekhe netaaon ne ise team anna kii chupa hua iraadaa qaraar diya he, to bijepi main bhi bechaini he
 Whereas Digvijay said, "we have also said earlier that these people are politically motivated and now the political ambitions of Team Anna have come out openly
 People should see the realities behind this movement themselves
" '' haalanki team anna ke is elaan ke baad bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari kehete hai, ''bhrashtachar ke khilaaf kisi bhi ladaai kaa ham samarthan karte hai lekin team anna kisi bhi surat main bijepi kaa vikalp nahin ho sakati
 "most of the attacks from Team Anna are happening on Congress and BJP, so Kejriwal broke the fast today and also invited those people to leave their party and join the group of national devotees (team Anna) who are the current political leaders
 Feeling suffocated while staying in the party
 rajnatik dalon ke saath saamaajik sanghathanon main bhi team anna ke rajnatik vikalp ke faisle par matbhed he
 Social activist Medha Patekar opposing this initiative has advised to reconsider, while Ramdev is calling it the death of the movement
 khud ramdev ek alag rajnatik manch khadaa karne kaa ishaara karte rahe hai, lekin team anna ke is faisle se ramdev ke 9 agast se kaale dhan ke mudde par shuru ho rahe andolan par asar pad saktaa he
 The announcement that Team Anna will enter politics will be tested in the upcoming elections, but it is certain that established political parties will surely lose the loss of becoming a central question of corruption

 Who is unlucky? Who is lucky? After all, what is the basic difference between one unfortunate and one unlucky? Who has the right to decide whether a person is destined or unfortunate? At a rally during the Delhi Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi described himself as a destiny for the country
 dwarka kii chunavi raily main modi ne kaha tha, 'petrol-dijal kii keemten kam hui hai or janata ke kuch paise bachane lage hai
 My opponents say that Modi is destined, so it happened
 maan lijie agar mere naseeb se daam kam hote hai to badanaseeb ko laane kii kya jarurat he? aap bataaen ki nasibavaala chahie yaa badanaseeb
 After this statement by Modi, there was a lot of debate on social media
 logon ne apane apane tareeke se is par apni pratikriya di
 In his speech, Modi had described himself as a destiny, but he did not name anyone about who is unfortunate
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main to modi ke nishane par hameshaa congress netaa rahul gandhi rahe, lekin dilli chunaavon main unke target par aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal hi rahe
 This is the reason why Modi's unfortunate talk was linked to Kejriwal
 mere man main bhi ye sawaal baar baar uthta rahaa
 Am i fated? Absolutely

 lekin agar mere hone se bade bade haadase hote hai, sookhaa padataa he, baadh barbaadi laati he, tsunami tabaahi laati he, bukamp jaan maal ko baari nuksaan pahunchaate hai, to main vaaki badanaseeb hum
 Now that a so-called unfortunate person has emerged as the biggest fugitive in the Delhi elections, questions are bound to arise
 kya ek badanaseeb kisi nasibavaale ke saath milakar nasibavaala ho saktaa he? kya ek nasibavaala kisi badanaseeb ke saath hone se badanaseeb ho jaataa he? shaayad nahin
 If that were the case, Delhi would have had a different outcome
 kehete hai - naseeb, karm se banataa bigadataa he
 The condition and direction of the destiny is determined by the act itself
 ab aap khud ko nasibavaala maanate hai yaa badanaseeb? ye sirf aapako hi tay karnaa he
 This is your duty as well as right

 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ko bhartiya raajnneeti ke itihaas main sabase ahm chunaav mana ja rahaa he or is mahamukaable ke nateezon se pehle aae agsit pole ne modi virdohi vichaardhaara ko bada jhatka diya he
 Mayawati, forgetting the old feud, allied with the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, seems to have failed in the purpose of overthrowing the Bharatiya Janata Party from power
 is lihaaj se 2014 main ek bhi loksabhaa seat na jeetne vaali basapa ke liye nattejey agar agsit pole se mail khate hai to yah mayawati ke liye unke raajnneetik jivan kaa sabase bada jhatka mana jayega
 Aaj Tak- Exit My India exit poll has a total of 80 seats in UP, out of which 62-68 seats are seen by BJP, SP-BSP-RLD alliance 10-16 and UPA 1-2 seats
 yani yah agsit pole bataa rahaa he ki akhilesh yadav or mayawati kaa gathjod kaam nahin kar paaya he or congress kii sthiti main bhi koi fark nahin aayaa he
 According to the exit poll, in UP, BJP is seen to get 48 per cent, Congress 8 per cent and the Grand Alliance 39 per cent
 upi main jab sapa-basapa gathbandhan hua to yah mana gaya ki rajya kii raajnneeti main bada dakhal rakhane vaale donon ne saath aakar bijepi ke liye kadi chunauti pesh kar di he
 Both parties also have their own vote banks
 mayawati jahaan dalit votbank kii raajnneeti par aadhaarit he to sapa yadav-muslim sameekaran par raajnneeti karti ai he
 In such a situation, everyone was expecting unilateral results for the Grand Alliance, seeing the alliance of dalit-muslim and Yadav vote bank parties in up's social fabric
 haalanki, bijepi mahagathbandhan ko mahamilawat kehete hue 2014 se zyada siten milane kaa daawa bijepi karti rahi he
 According to exit poll, Mayawati is in trouble
 2014 main jab modi lahar chali to basapa 19
 Could not win a single seat with 8% votes
 jabaki usase pehle basapa kaa pradarshan kaaphi acha rahaa
 27 to the BSP in 2009
 4% vot ke saath 20 seat or 2004 main 24
 It won 19 Lok Sabha seats with 7% of the vote
 yahi nahin, 2007 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav main basapa ne soshal ejineering ke dam par purna bahumat kii sarkaar banaai
 But after losing first in the 2012 assembly elections, the BSP, which was zero in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, did not get anything in the 2017 assembly elections and its party was reduced to just 19 seats
 in nateezon ko dekhte hue hi shaayad mayawati ne lakhanu guest house cond tak bhula diya or mulaayam singh yadav ke bete akhilesh yadav se gathjod kar liya
 Despite this, the results of exit polls are coming out, this socialist formula of Mayawati is also seen to be completely destroyed
 aise main jahaan charchaa ye chal rahi thi ki mayawati apni raajnneetik viraasat bhattije ko supurd kar khud ko centre kii raajnneeti main le jane kaa khwab dekh rahi hai, vahaan chunaav-dar chunaav pichhadati ja rahi mayawati ke liye agsit pole ke anumaanon ne pani pherane jaisaa kaam kiya he
 There has been a revolt within the Election Commission
 tisare ayukta ashok lavasa ne 4 may ko mukhya chunaav ayukta sunil aroda ko patr likhaa he
 It states that they are being forced not to attend the entire meeting of the Commission
 unki asahmatiyon ko darj nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 All three commissioners are involved in the entire meeting
 har baat darj kii jaati he
 But this news should bother every Indian that there is no game going on inside the commission
 ashok lavasa ne pradhanmantri ke kilaaf kii gai shikayaton ke faisle main bhi asahmati di thi
 The Commission was questioned that it was defending the Prime Minister in violation of the Code of Conduct
 hamaare sahyogi arvind gunashekhar subah se hi yah khabar kar rahe hai
 Ashok Lavasa has written in his letter that my role in the commission meetings has become meaningless as my disagreements are not being recorded
 main anya raste apnaane par vichaar kar saktaa hum taaki ayog kanoon ke hisaab se kaam kar sake or asamahatiyon ko ricard kare
 Tell that some Election Commissioner is writing that the Commission is not working according to the law
 ham kaise apana bharosa is ayog main vyakt kar sakate hai
 It is getting the election of the public or getting Modi elected
 chunaav ayukta ashok lavasa kaa yah patr halke main nahin liya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, all kinds of allegations are being leveled at the Election Commission
 kya chunaav manage kiya ja rahaa he? kya ayog par dabaav dekar faisle likhwaaye ja rahe hai
 No evidence is left in the future, so disagreement is not being recorded
 hamaare sahyogi arvind gunashekhar ne likhaa he ki ashok lavasaa ke is patr ke baad mukhya chunaav ayukta sunil aroda ne baithak bulaai magar koi nateeja nahin niklaa he
 Sunil Arora's argument is that only minority opinion is recorded in Quasi judicial matters
 aachaar samhita ke ulanghan par jo faisla diya he vah ardh nyaayik kism kaa nahin he
 We all know that minutes are recorded in meetings of such institutions
 pradhanmantri ne indian express ko kaha he ki cabinet kii baitka kaa minutes ricard hota he or use manzur kiya jaataa he
 Which is the rule in the Election Commission? sunil aroda kaa jawaab paryaapt nahin lagata he
 There is a need to be cautious about the role of the Election Commission
 pradhanmantri kedarnath nikal gaye hai
 Shiva Purana programs on Hindi channels will soon be filled with that excuse
 lekin aisi khabaron ko janata tak pahunchane kaa kaam ab janata kaa hi he
 It is a question of the future of your democracy
 yah samaanya ghatana nahin he
 a commissioner is writing that the Election Commission is not operating by law
 phir ham us ayog se kaise ummid lagaaein ki vah nishpaksh chunaav kara rahaa he
 The Congress has targeted the BJP for filing a lawsuit by the UP government against a journalist who disclosed serving salt bread in the mid-day meal
 congress ne ek soshal media post ke jariye bijepi par hamalaa karte hue likhaa, 'BJP ko ek aise patrkaar kii jarurat he, jo 'tathyon' ko report karata ho
 But if the 'story is correct', he can also be sent to jail
 ' congress ne apane instragram acount par chutki lete hue vigyapannuma ek poster saajha kiya, jisamen likhaa he ki bijepi ek patrkaar talash rahi he
 It is further written in the poster that, please do not talk about salary because GDP has reached 5 percent
 har din logon ko alag-alag tareeke se pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he
 The poster further reads as a necessary qualification for the job, reporting the failure of government schemes
 video le saktaa ho, jiskaa aapke khilaaf hi istemaal ho saktaa he
 Also, there should be no criminal record, because it will happen to us automatically

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kai maukon par pradhanmantri narendra modi yaa bhartiya janata party par sidhe hamalaa karne kii bajaay rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par zyada hamalavar hote hai
 Looking at the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi may intensify his attack on the Sangh
 'mail today' kii khabar ke mutabik piem modi ko mil rahe janaadhar ke aage rahul gandhi ne sangh par apana focus shift kar liya he
 Critics have often described Rahul Gandhi as a 'reluctant prince' who has long held power at number two, but shies away from taking responsibility
 lekin amethi se saansadarahul gandhi is hafte sangh par sabase tej hamalaa kiya
 Rahul did this attack in JDU rebel leader Sharad Yadav's 'save Shared Heritage' program
 yahaan rahul ne kaha ki aresas jaanata he ki unki vichaardhaara is desh main chunaav nahin jeet sakati, isliye unhone sanvaidhanik sansthaaon main apane log baitaane shuru kar die
 The RSS knows that on the day their people sit in the judiciary, bureaucracy, army, media, this country will belong to them
 rahul ne sangh par waar karte hue kaha ki in logon ne tirange ko salaam karnaa bhi satta main aane ke baad siikhaa
 As long as there will be 'one man one vote' in this country, this country cannot be theirs
 rahul ye sab aise samay main bol rahe hai, jab congress party ek ke baad ek chunaav haar rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi had also questioned the Sangh's vision of seeing the country and said that there are two ways to see the country, this country is mine, one says that i belong to this country, this is the difference between us and the RSS is
 aresas kahata he ki ye desh hamaara he
 You do not belong to it
 haalanki sangh ne rahul par palatwaar bhi kiya
 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Manmohan Vaidya has said that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi does not know anything about the Sangh
 aresas ke sadasyon ne swatantraaa sangram main hissaa liya tha
 The top Congress leaders are happy with this strategy of the Congress Vice President and they want to maintain this war of words
 unka maananaa he ki modi ko kyon anuchit shrey diya jaae? yaharesasahai, jisane unhen pesh kiya he
 He is just a byproduct
 yah kaise samajhaayaa ja saktaa he ki shivaraj singh chouhan or raman singh ke behatar pradarshan ke baavjood modi ko pradhanmantri pad ke liye chunaa gaya tha?akhil bhartiya congress cameti ke mahasachiv seepi joshi ne mail today se kaha- 'rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa astitv 1925 se lekar 1947 tak rahaa
 And what was his role in the freedom struggle? The RSS has always strived to seize political power
 ab jab vah satta main he, to vah itihaas ko dobaaraa likhane or har cheez ko badalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Joshi said that the BJP became relevant when Modi came
 yah ab congress or aresas ke bich vichaardhaaraon kaa sidhaa sangharsh he
 Party seniors say that a precise campaign strategy will be worked out after the Congress' internal election in October
 aresas kii vichaardhaara or unke kattarpanthi tareeke se logon ke bich bahut asantosh he
 a senior Congress official said that the strategy of attacking the Sangh is mainly the idea of rahul Gandhi and once he fully takes over the party, a significant change in the party's strategy for 2019 will start to appear

 As far as policy is concerned, providing electricity, expanding the network of canals, getting loans for agriculture, more use of machines, better ratio of changing seeds, more use of fertilizers - all these are important in achieving this growth figure Played the role

 When Nitish Kumar won the 2005 assembly elections and came to power in Bihar, it was considered a mandate against the 15-year misrule of lalu-rabri
 in paanch saalon main chakra puri tarah gum chukaa he
 Nitish has successfully replaced Lalu as a reference point in Bihar's electoral politics
 is saal vidhansabha chunaav hone ja rahaa he or jo bhi vot padegaa vah yaa to unke paksh main hoga yaa phir unke khilaaf
 Some people say that the benefit of this polarization is not as high as it appears
 aise samay main jab yuddh kaa maidan saj chukaa he or sipahasaalar apane sajo-saamaan kaa hisaab-kitaab laga rahe hai, nitish kumaar ne apane paanch saal ke sabase lokapriy kaarykram ko sthagit kar diya haih yani saptahik janata darbar, vah mauka jab mukhyamantri ke nivas / karyaalay ke daravaaje aam aadmi ke liye khule rahete or ve apni samasyaayein nibatane ke liye sidhe un tak laa sakate the
 They have now embarked on a statewide tour
 ve rajya ke 38 jilon main jaaenge or un logon tak pahunchenge jo somvaar ko yojit hone vaale janata darbar kaa hissaa nahin ban sake the
 Is Nitish getting a little anxious before the election, now he has to save his crown? Does he feel that his credibility is not enough? Perhaps engineer-turned-politician Nitish is eager to earn more profit by taking the first step
 up-mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi kehete hai, ''nitish kumaar tikshn buddhi vaale shaks hai or 15-16 ghante kaam karte hai
 They take every action to its conclusion and also execute ideas
 ''oonchaaiyon ko chune vaale har shaks kii tarah nitish bhi kuch samasyaon se ghire hue hai- inamen kuch unki khud kii paidaa kii hui hai
 Although his new social equations have made new friends, there are people who once stood by him, but now those people do not have the same love for him as before
 apni yatra ke dauraan, nitish praathmik swasthya kendron kii jaanch kar rahe hai, peedies dukaanon kaa nirikshan kar rahe hai or shramikon se nijee taur par puch rahe hai ki unhen nunatam dihadi di ja rahi he yaa nahin
 The timing of his empirical investigation makes it slightly different from the usual administrative steps
 jab baat auron se aage nikalne kii ho to apane nishchay ko sakht anushaasan ke saath jodne ke kaaran nitish pehle hi aisi sthiti hasil kar chuke hai jo unke pratidwandvi rajd pramukh abhi paane ke liye sangharshrat hai
 Not only this, he is always completely calm, highly articulate and dangerously diplomatic
 phir bhi, chunaav ke liye chal rahi is pratispardhaa main unke liye sab kuch ekadam thik nahin he
 In 2005, Nitish had strong support from all sides against Lalu's supremacy
 vah samay tha jab saamaajik or rajnatik duniya ke vibhinn vichaar ke doston-sahanubhuti rakhane waalon samet oonchi jati se lekar atyadhik pichhadaa varg (ibisi) ke matadaataaon tak, vyapaariyon se lekar peshewaron tak or gruhaniyon se lekar chaatro tak ne ji-jaan se unka samarthan kiya
 Now, many of his friends — such as Munger's MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan and former MP Prabhunath Singh, who once supported him against Lalu — have taken the front to oust him
 kai duusare jinhone nitish kaa saath dene ke liye dusron ko chhod diya, jaise purv mantri naagamani, unhone bhi paala badal liya he or ab unke khilaaf kaam karne ke liye din-raat ek kiye hue hai
 If these leaders withdraw even a small part of their support base from Nitish, they can hurt Nitish's plans to return to power once again
 lekin, aakhir kyon itane dher saare dost unhen chhodkar chale gaye? aisa isliye kyonki hameshaa hi safalataa kii kuch keemat chukaani padati he? yaa aisa isliye kyonki ve kuch alag mizaaj dikhaane lage hai?aisa lagata he kuch-kuch donon hi kaaran hai
 Those leaving him allege that he is "an autocrat who wants everyone to get their point"
 '' naagamani kehete hai, ''ve jo chaahate hai usase ek ratti bhi yahaan se vahaan nahin hone dete hai
 They do not like to discuss even during the cabinet meeting
 '' pichley saal, bhaajapa saansad bholaa singh-jinhone mukhyamantri ke sarkari nivas par hui rajg vidhayak dal kii baithak main ek baar nitish kii aalochana kar di thi-unase mulaakaat kaa samay maang-maang kar thak gaye, lekin na to unhen samay mila or na hi ve mukhyamantri se mil hi sake
 The biggest achievement of the Nitish government is to curb crime in the state, though it is slightly below expectations
 2006 se abhi tak 44,000 aparaadhiyon ko sajaa sunai ja chuki he jo kaaphi prabhavit karne vaala aankada he
 More than 356 people, mostly government officials, have been caught on charges of taking bribes
 arthvyavastha 11
 It is growing at a rate of 35 percent and 2,417 km of roads have been constructed during the last financial year alone
 yahi nahin, nitish ne bhai-bhatijawad ko lekar bhi kadaa rukh apanaaya he, isi bhai-bhatijawad ko lalu or paswan ke patan kaa mukhya kaaran bataaya jaataa he, jisane unki partiyon ko khandaani jaagir main tabdeel karke rakh diya tha
 So far, his twin goals of development along with aggressive social justice continue to give electoral advantage
 vot bank par nazren tikaae hue unhone rajya ke sarkari karmchaariyon kaa mahangaai bhatta badha diya he or vishesh sahaayak police karmiyon ke vetan main vruddhi kar di he
 Recently, the state cabinet has allocated Rs 797 crore
 mukhyamantri kii schuli bacchon ko vardi or cycle dene kii yojana ke liye manjuur kiye hai
 In February this year, Deputy Chief Minister Modi raised Rs 53,927 crore
 ke aadhiky rajasav vaala bajet pesh kiya tha
 The need for politics has on many occasions forced Nitish to make a minor difference in what he says and what he does
 24 november, 2005 se mukhyamantri pad sanbhaalane ke baad se nitish ne mahadaliton ko shaamil karke apane mandal club kaa vistaar kiya or kuch alpsankhyak samarthan bhi jutaya he jiske liye unki muslim samarthit nitiyaan jimmedaar hai
 Today, Paswan and Lalu know that Nitish is trying his best to break into his vote bank
 jativiheen raajnneeti or up-rashtrawaad ko protsaahan se jude unke aagrah ke baavjood ve vibhinn jati samoohon dwaara yojit kiye jane vaali reliyon or baithkon main jane se nahin chookte
 Be it the meeting of the Brahmin Samaj Political Consciousness Committee or a Mahadalit Sabha, they have attended all the meetings in view of the elections
 unke aalochakon kaa aarope he ki nitish bahut hi sayaanepan ke saath jati aadhaarit card khel rahe hai
 Under his Mahadalit experiment, 21 out of 22 Dalit castes in Bihar have been included in Mahadalits for special benefit
 22veen jati dushaadh-jinhen virdohi lojpa adhyaksh ramvilas paswan ke saath pahachaanaa jaataa he-ko suchi se baahar rakhaa gaya he, haalanki unke liye alag se vaade jarur kiye gaye hai
 It is enough to surprise most people that this classification, after all, is important
 nitish mandal or pragativaad kaa sangam karne main bhi lage hue hai
 In this context, 20 per cent reservation can be taken for Panchayat seats for Extremely Backward Classes and 50 per cent for women
 ye bahut hi chaalaaki bhare rajnatik kadam hai, jo unhen pichhadi jatiyon ke bich unke mandal se jude vichaar ko vyapak str par failaane main madad karenge
 Apart from this, their new base land as women will also be ready
 party adhyaksh sharad yadav ke virodh ke baavjood unka sansad main mahila aarakshan vidheyak kaa samarthan karnaa unka mandal kii chhap vaale raajnneetik kii rudh chhavi se baahar aane kaa sochaa-samaj prayaas najar aata he
 If Nitish decides his stand on any matter when it is necessary, then he does not hold back from taking an avoidable stand when needed in practical politics
 udhaaharan ke liye bataaidari kaarykram ko thande baste main rakhe jane sambandhi kadam ko liya ja saktaa he
 He did this when the leaders of the upper caste united against him
 nitish kaa puraa dhyaan apane sakaaratmak pahaluon ko ekajute karnaa he to jaahir taur par apane virodhiyon ko paaydaan se neeche dhakelnaa he
 To survive on both fronts, there is a lot of energy and political capital required, so Nitish will have to put all other things under his double agenda to regain power in Bihar
 unhen apni sheersh variyata kii raah main aane vaali lokapriy or jaruri baton ko bhi bhoolanaa hoga, bilkul janata darbar kii tarah
 Looking at all the signs, it is probably because the Chief Minister of Bihar, who is a member of the Legislative Council, should refrain himself from contesting elections this time
 kisi bahari shaks ke liye ye sab bihar kii vyaktitv aadhaarit raajnneeti se mail khaataa hua najar nahin aata-yaa phir nitish kii janata ke netaa kii chhavi se
 But in this election year, Nitish must have assessed his dual responsibility of campaigning and strategizing that if not contesting, he can focus on the entire state without being tied to a particular seat
 unke chunaav ladane ke bajaae sirf prachaar or ranneeti banane par puri tarah dhyaan kendrit karne ke is kadam kii taid ateet se bhi hoti he
 The Lok Sabha elections held last year were the first time in the last twenty years that Nitish Kumar had not contested from any seat for the first time in private
 lekin rajya main rajg kii 40 main se 32 siton par jeet hui or is jeet ke liye akele unke hyaason ko hi puraa shrey diya ja saktaa he
 However, Nitish does not take defeat as much as victory, with much poise and restraint
 pichley saal sitambar main, jab up-chunaav main rajg kii 18 main se 13 siton par haar hui to unhone ise ''maatr practice match'' bataaya or iske liye har kisi ko doshi tehra diya, jisamen matadaata tak shaamil tha
 He said that voters have failed to realize the negative effects of bringing Lalu and Paswan back to Bihar
 lalu prasad yadav kii apeksha kaaphi behatar sarkaar dene ke kaaran nitish kumaar jaahir taur par rajd pramukh par baari to padate najar aa rahe hai
 Not only this, if we talk about social engineering, then he also did what Lalu did, of course much more than that and with a very sophisticated style
 lekin pareshaaniyaan to phir bhi maujuud hi hai
 The BJP does not feel comfortable with their minority-backed views
 lekin nitish puri tarah se aashwast najar aate hai
 Perhaps the engineer inside them knows very well that things often go much worse before they get better
 congress ke nichle str ke kaaryakarta priyanka gandhi ko sakriy raajnneeti main laane kii kai baar maang kar chuke hai, lekin ab yahi maang punjab ke purv mukhyamantri or amritsar ke saansad captain amarinder singh ne bhi uthaai he
 He has said that now Priyanka should come forward to help Rahul
 amarinder singh ne priyanka gandhi ke raajnneeti main sakriy hone kii aaj joardaar vakaalat karte hue kaha ki party ke phaayde ke liye vah or rahul gandhi ek duusare ke poorak ho sakate hai
 He said, 'at a time when 70 per cent of the people in India are under 40 years of age, we will be very happy if we work together in complementary roles
 ' unhone kaha ki donon 'jaankaar or bhavishyavaadee' hai or jaanate hai ki duniya main kya ho rahaa he
 The former Punjab Chief Minister, who defeated BJP leader Arun Jaitley on the Amritsar seat in the Lok Sabha elections, dismissed the targeting of Team Rahul for the party's defeat in the election, terming it as 'unwarranted'
 unhone kaha ki yah rahul ko faisla karnaa he ki vah loksabhaa main vipaksh kaa netaa bananaa chaahate hai yaa nahin
 In the backdrop of the party's crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the demand for Priyanka Gandhi to be brought forward in politics is gaining momentum in the Congress
 isse pehle nivartmaan khaadya mantri kevi thomas ne kaha tha, 'congress kaa sadsy hone ke naate main chahta hum ki priyanka ko mukhya kaaryakshetra main aana chahie
 He should work as a team with mother Sonia Gandhi and brother Rahul Gandhi
 ' To put pressure on the Congress-led central government, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to launch a nationwide 'halla Bol' movement against inflation, corruption, scams and FDI, a day before the winter session of Parliament starting on November 22
 
 is hallaa bol kaarykram main party ke lagbhag sabhi sheersh netaa hissaa lenge
 Giving this information, Party Vice President Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that in addition to the above issues in all the districts of the country on 21 November, allegations of serious corruption against the Prime Minister's Office and the family of UPA President Sonia Gandhi will be revealed
 unhone kaha, ‘congress ke netritv vaali centre sarkaar kaa ‘sansad main ank ganit or sadak par jan ganit’ donon bighad chukaa he
 Despite this, the government is taking decisions that are anti-people and harm the interests of the country
 ’nakvi ne aarope lagaaya ki pichley saadhe aath saalon ke upie shashan main parmaanu samjhaute or khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh ke do bade faisle kiye gaye or donon hi videshi hiton ko dhyaan main rakh kar kiye gaye
 In this nationwide protest against the UPA government, Nitin Gadkari in Arunachal Pradesh, Arun Jaitley in Mumbai, Murli Manohar Joshi in Delhi, m Venkaiah Naidu in Hyderabad, Rajnath Singh and Naqvi in delhi, Anant Kumar in Lucknow, Ravi Shankar Prasad in Jaipur, Goa Shahnawaz Hussain will lead the Nirmala Sitharaman movement in Kolkata
 nakvi ke anusaar isi din sansad main sarkaar ke khilaaf ranneeti taiyaar karne ke liye yahaan hone vaali rajg kii baithak ke kaaran laalkrishna adwani or sushamaa swaraj hallaa bol andolan main shirkat nahin karenge
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has always been lenient towards Nitish Kumar
 2000 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaavon main usne 67 siten jiti thim jo nitish kumaar kii samta party (espi) kii 34 siton se lagbhag dugani thim
 Still, he put forward the name of Nitish Kumar for the post of Chief Minister
 unhone saat dinon ke andar hi istipha de diya tha lekin vah ek lambii dosti kii shuruyaat thi jisamen nitish ko varisht saajhedaar kii bhoomika saunpi gai
 This alliance was victorious in 2005 and in 2010 it came to power with a tremendous three-fourth majority
 jaahir he, bijepi aae din nitish dwaara gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko nishaanaa banaae jane or gathbandhan todgaye kii unki dhamkiyon se vyathit he
 But Nitish can prove to be the real loser in his insistence on keeping Modi out of the race for the nda's prime ministerial candidate
 nitish kii party janata dal (united) jediu kaa maananaa he ki bijepi se apana gathbandhan todgaye se unhen koi khaas nuksaan nahin hoga
 Nitish has formed a broad social coalition of the underprivileged by adopting targeted social welfare measures while in power
 apane mul kurmi vot bank ko sahaara dene ke liye unhone ati pichhadi jatiyon (ibisi), mahadaliton, pichde musalamaanon or mahilaon jaise jati nirpeksh tatasth matadaataaon tak ko milakar safaltaapurvak nayaa samarthan samooh taiyaar kar liya he or is tarah bihar main ve lagbhag ajey ho gaye hai
 Nitish's successful social coalition is designed to reverse the dominance of the traditionally powerful social groups of the Yadavs, Paswan, Bhumihars and Brahmins
 aisa karte hue unhone apane mukhya pratidwandviyon lalu prasad yadav or ram vilaas paswan ko kamjor kiya he
 At first he weakened Lalu from the Mandal structure to the most backward castes, which were about 33 of the total electorate
 5 fisadi hai, alag kiya
 He then formed a new social group of Mahadalits by joining 21 of the 22 sub-castes coming into the Scheduled Castes and giving a strong blow to Paswan of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP)
 unhone is mahadalit sutrikaran ke baahar jo iklauti jati chodi, vah paswan thi
 The government has satisfied Mahadalits, who comprise 11 percent of the total electorate, by adopting welfare measures such as free land, education and other assistance
 unke pratidwandviyon ke liye unke saamaajik gathbandhan kaa ganit unhen mili voton ke pratishat se pramanit nahin hota
 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Ram Kripal Yadav says, "JDU has never received even a quarter of the total votes cast in Bihar till date
 ’’ pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main jediu ko akele 25 pratishat se kam vot mili the, lekin bijepi ke saath uske gathbandhan ne 40 pratishat ke aas-paas vot hasil kiye
 Despite losing badly in 2010, the RJD received 20 percent of the vote
 bijepi ke bagaiyr nitish lalu ke saamne kamjor padenge, khaastaur par tab yadi lalu-paswan athwa congress ke saath gathbandhan kar len
 The BJP had won 90 percent of the seats in the 2010 assembly elections
 use mukhya rup se vaisya jatiyon, savarnon or jati nirpeksh nirpeksh madhyam varg ke ek samooh kaa samarthan hasil he
 In 2009, it won 12 Lok Sabha seats
 party ko lagata he ki vah or bhi behatar kar sakati he
 a senior BJP leader from the state says, "the people of Bihar are getting disenchanted with Nitish
 bijepi kii siten nishchit rup se badhengi
 "the truth is that Nitish has to contend with a strong anti-incumbency wave in the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, unlike the 2010 assembly elections
 bijepi kii mukhya aadhaar oonchi jatiyaan naaraaz hai kyonki unhen lagata he ki nitish chun-chunakar apane ibisie mahadalit or musalmaan matadaata samarthakon kii jarurat kaa hi dhyaan de rahe hai
 Ashutosh Singh, former head of Rukhi Panchayat in Nawada district, says, "JDU has only used us as a ladder
 yadi vah bijepi se naata todta he to hamaara vot bijepi ko jayega
 There are some other powerful groups strongly opposed to Nitish
 theke par rakhe gaye lagbhag 2,50,000 skool teacher unase isliye naaraaz hai ki ve niyamit shikshakon ke baraabar vetan die jane kii unki maang nahin maan rahe hai
 The separation of the BJP and JDU will see a change in the voting behavior of various communities in Bihar
 phir bhi lagata he ki kurmi, ibisi or mahadalit jediu ko vot denge jabaki oonchi jatiyaan bijepi kaa saath dengi
 Even then, Nitish will need the support of a large part of the Muslim vote
 unke vot ke liye unhen lalu se laduya hoga
 According to a senior JDU leader, about 25 percent of the Muslims of the state voted for the NDA in the 2010 assembly elections and subsequent by-elections
 ye bache hue 75 pratishat hi jediu ke sambhavit matadaata ho sakate hai
 He says, "if Nitish breaks away from the NDA on Modi's issue, he will emerge as a favorite of Muslims in the same way as Lalu emerged after Advani was arrested
" ’’bihar kii kul aabaadi main 16
 53 percent are Muslims and they are said to have a decisive vote in eight of the 40 Lok Sabha seats there
 jin jilon main unka adhiktam chunavi prabhaav he unamem arriya, jahaan ve aabaadi kaa 41
 There are 14 percent, Purnia (36
 76 pratishat), katihaar (42
 53 percent) and Kishanganj (67
 58 pratishat) hai
 They have little impact on other seats
 chunavi safalataa paane ke liye agar nitish ek hi samudaay par apana daanv lagaate hai to ve ek jokhim hi lenge
 They can reduce this risk by tying up with Congress
 congress lagbhag 10 pratishat mat hasil karti he or muslim voton ko jodgaye main bhi madad kar sakati he
 On the other hand, due to this, they may have to face the dual anti-incumbency wave because they are in power in Patna and Congress in the center
 agar congress lalu or paswan ke saath bhi samjhauta karti he to nitish ko apane virdohi ek majboot gathbandhan se bhi jujhna hoga
 Nitish's path is really difficult
 kyonki ek bahukoniya mukaable main voton kaa chota-sa jhukaav bhi apriy achambhe khadey kar saktaa he
 The politics of Bihar is now at an interesting juncture
 -saath main bhaavana viz aroda Have you ever seen 4 crore 25 lakh rupees together? wo bhi hajaar hajaar ke note main
 Noida police is also fulfilling your wishes
 maamla ek hiprophile apharan cese se judaa he jisame 5 karod kii phiroti di gai lekin 19 din ke baad aparankartaaon ke gang se 4 karod 25 lakh baraamad kar liya gaya
 Actually the whole matter is related to a high profile kidnapping in which the person who is kidnapping is a rich industrialist of Noida
 jisamen apharan karne vaala gang he meerut kaa or jisame phiroti main di gai 5 karod kii rakam main se baraamad hissaa he 4 karod 25 lakh rupye kaa
 This whole story of kidnapping, ransom and seizure is related to a wealthy industrialist of Noida
 21 sitambar kii shaam ko kapil gupta kaa apharan hota he or greater noida main unhen bandhak rakhaa jaataa he
 He is released on September 24, but after 19 days, not one but 10 criminals are arrested
 kapil gupta naam he noida ke is udyogpati kaa jiske ird-gird hi buni hui he ye puri kahani
 September 21 was the date when Kapil Gupta was returning from Delhi in his Mercedes car to his home in Noida Sector 15A
 tabhi dendi fliover ke paas ek car main savaar aparankartaaon ne shaam ke kareeb saadhe 6 baje unka apharan kar liya
 On the morning of 22 September, the kidnappers first called Kapil Gupta's house for ransom

 ' ranjit urf rakibul kaa maamla ek aisa maamla ban gaya he jisamen har roj nae sach saamne aa rahe hai
 The one who climbed the stairs of success by trapping the law under the stakes of relationships is now badly trapped
 patni ke lagaae ‘lav jehad’ ke iljaam se wo pehle hi ghir chukaa tha or ab uske flaton main hui chhapemari se jo raaj baahar nikle hai usne ek baar phir sabko chaunkaa diya he
 Ranjith aka Rakibul's life is nothing short of a film story
 kabhi chand paison ke liye tarasane vaala vyakti raaton raat kuch aisa amir hua ki bhikhaariyon ko bheekh main 500 rupee tak dene laga
 But how he completed the journey from floor to hail in just 5 years is also a big secret
 wo pehle garib hua karata tha, kabhi wo kiraane kii dukaan main kaam karata
 Sometimes he used to be the videographer's lightman at the marriage party and sometimes kept a record of a dhaba
 lekin ab ye sab kuch gujarey jamaane kii baat he
 Before being arrested in the case of 'love Jihad', people used to get their fingers pressed under their teeth seeing Ranjit alias Rakibul's richness and chic
 rakibul kii takadir palatney kii shuruyaat 2002 or 2003 se hui
 Earlier he used to be poor and was living a normal life
 lekin isi bich ek ladke se uski ladaai kya hui wo jail gaya or uski kismat hi badal gai
 After coming out of jail he disappeared completely for 5 years
 lekin isi bich jab wo waapas pahunchaa to uski jindagi badal chuki thi
 He started playing in crores, people who know him say that at first he did not even have 10-20 rupees, and then he started paying 70 thousand rent for 3 houses in Ranchi
 rakibul ko jaanane vaale log bataate hai 5 saal tak khufia jindagi jeene ke baad jab wo lautaa to badi gadiyon main ghumaa karata tha
 If a beggar would ever get a 500-note note, he would buy a 10-rupee thing and take out a thousand-note note from his pocket, people were amazed to see his manner
 rakibul ke ye 5 saal beshak duniya ke liye ek paheli hon, lekin ab sutron kaa daawa he ki usne inhi 5 saalon main political or judicial lijining yani dallali karke karodon rupee kamaaye
 He used to work for people on the basis of their relationships, bribes and girls and climbed the stairs of success
 hoicourt ke register mushtak ahamed se to uske puraane rishte the hi
 He used to go to the shooting range with Mushtaq about his hobby of shooting and here he met with national level shooter Tara Shahdev
 iske baad khud mushtak ahamed ranjit se rakibul bane is shaks kaa rishta lekar tara shahdev ke ghar gaye the or phir donon kii shaadi karwaai thi
 But now the new face of Rakibul is in front of the world and now everyone is waiting for the day when the CBI will bring the whole truth of Rakibul to the world
 ‘lav jehad’ maamle ko lekar puure jharkhand main koharaam machaa hua he, to duusari taraf isi maamle ko lekar rajya ke kai bade afasar or netaa dare hue hai
 Because in police interrogation, the revelations made by Ranjit alias Rakibul have given sleep to many influential people of the state
 police kii maane to wo apana kaam nikalwane ke liye hanitrap kaa istemaal kiya karata tha
 That is, in addition to money for work, the girl as well as the police, he is also confessing all his crimes
 ranchi kaa ‘lav jehad’ maamla shuru to hua tha pati patni ke jhagade or jabaran dharm parivartan ke iljaamon se, lekin badhate-badhate ye maamla ‘lav jehad’ se bahut aage hai profile sex racket or judicial karpshan tak ja pahunchaa he
 Perhaps this is the reason that on the one hand, while the Chief Minister of Jharkhand Hemant Soren has announced to hand over the investigation to the CBI, on the other hand, ministers, magistrates and officers close to Rakibul are scared about the countdown of their names coming out
 
 ab tak ki poochtacha main ranjit urf rakibul ne 40 se zyada afasaron or mantriyon ko najadik se jaanane kii baat kabool kii he
 He has also told that he used to supply girls to them in return for getting work done from such people
 rakibul ke inhen khulaason ke maddenjar ab police ek taraf rachi main maujuud uske teenon makaanon kaa konaa-konaa chaan rahi he or duusari taraf ranchi ke sabase posh player apartment kii sisitivi or rakibul ke laptop or 5 mobile phone kii jaanch kar rahi he
 It is also taking the help of cyber forensics experts to get to the bottom of the secret hidden in electronic devices

 unhone twit karke kaha, ki agar rus 2016 ke chunaav main aisa kar rahaa tha to yah sab obama prashasan ke kaarykaal main hua
 He also asked why he did not try to stop Russia
 trump ne yah daawa bhi kiya ki aantarik suraksha ke purv pramukh je janson nae varisht khufia adhikari hai jinhone kaha he ki trump or rus ke bich aisa koi bada gathjod nahin tha
 Earlier, the charges were made by the tweet through tweet, although they did not present any concrete evidence about their claims

 He said, is it legitimate to tap the presidential candidate's phone before the election

 For a long time between producer director Karan Johar and Bollywood's 'singham' Ajay Devgan, all is not well
 lekin kal tak dabi jubaan main charchaa-e-aam rahane vaali yah baat ab khule taur par saamne aa gai he
 Karan Johar recently congratulated the director of the film Rohit Shotti on the success of 'singham Returns' on Twitter, but the special thing is that Karan did not discuss the film's lead Ajay Devgan in it
 Just saw # singhamreturns

 During an interview recently, Ajay also clarified that his equations with Karan have never been correct
 ajay ne intervyuu main kaha tha, 'karan ke saath mere sameekaran hameshaa ek samaan rahe hai
 We have never had a very good friendship
 ' haalanki, 'kaal' ke baad ajay karan johar ke sho 'coffee vid karan' main bhi najar aae the
 It is also interesting to note that Ajay's wife has been an old friend of Kajol Karan, but it seems that sourness in the relationship with Ajay has also affected kajol-karan's relationship

 Just before the voting in the Delhi Assembly elections, Narendra Modi held a public meeting in Chandni Chowk, in which he first uttered a few words about the Aam Aadmi Party
 
 
 unhone arvind kejariwal kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha tha ki jin logon ne anna hajaare jaise sant ko dhokhaa de diya, dilli kii janata un par bharosa na kare
 
 
 BJP strategists were not taking the Aam Aadmi Party more seriously in the Delhi elections, and perhaps that was the reason why Modi too did not give much preference to Kejriwal and his party in his speeches
 
 
 lekin aam aadmi party ko nazarandaaz karne kaa khamiyaaza bijepi ko bhugatna padaa
 
 
 a large number of youth and middle class voted for the broom
 
 
 aam aadmi party ko mili aitihaasik kamyaabi ne bijepi ke sameekaran bigaad die
 
 
 Kejriwal's party blocked the BJP from coming to power in Delhi
 
 
 iske baad madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main mili bijepi kii kamyaabi ko bhulaakar media din-raat kejariwal ke gungan main lag gaya
 
 
 It is a different matter that the manner in which Kejriwal ran the 49-day government in Delhi and resigned, he had to face the displeasure of a large section of the people who voted for him in Delhi
 
 
 ab arvind kejariwal ek baar phir surkhiyon main hai
 
 
 His party has fielded over 300 candidates for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections across the country
 
 
 kai jagahon par unke ummidavaaron kii saaf-suthri chhavi matadaataaon ko is party kii ore aakarshith bhi kar rahi he
 
 
 On leaving the government in Delhi, Kejriwal is giving a clarification to the people
 
 
 janamat surveykshanon main narendra modi kii jeet kii bhavishyavaanee ko dekhte hue kejariwal ne unhen apana nishaanaa bananaa shuru kar diya he
 
 
 After a road show in Gujarat, he made a sharp attack on Modi
 
 
 unase kisaanon kii aatmahatya se lekar adani udyog samooh ko phayda pahunchane jaise 16 sawaal puche
 
 
 The rightful cancer was completed against Benaras by contesting against Narendra Modi
 
 
 is tarah vah ek baar phir media kii surkhiyon main apni jagah banane main kaamyaab ho gaye hai
 
 
 Those who had been silent on Arvind Kejriwal since his election meeting in Chandni Chowk, Narendra Modi, started the campaign by attacking Kejriwal in his first meeting in Jammu for the Lok Sabha elections four months later
 
 
 kejariwal ko pakistan kaa agent bataakar unhone unki rashtrabhakti par sawaal khadaa kar diya
 
 
 In the evening, his attack on Kejriwal continued even in Delhi, where he attacked Kejriwal for leaving the government and accused him of colluding with the Congress
 
 
 isi tarah gujarat sarkaar ne kejariwal ke sawaalon ke jawaab main 16 pannon kaa bayaan jari kar har aarope kaa silsilewar dhang se jawaab diya he
 
 
 BJP strategists say that Modi has targeted Kejriwal as a well-conceived strategy
 
 
 pichley do maheenon se kejariwal ke nishane par congress kaa kathith bhrashtachar nahin, balki modi ke gujarat kaa kathith vikaas model he
 
 
 He has been campaigning against Modi by roaming around the country, and questioning the claims of development in Gujarat
 
 
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki aisa karke vah congress kii hi madad kar rahe hai, kyonki bhrashtachar ke aarope or sarkaar-virdohi lahar jhel rahi congress kii logon main ab vah saakh nahin bachi he ki log uski baton ko gambhirtha se len, isiilie congress ne aam aadmi party ko aage kiya he
 
 
 The BJP also argues in support of the charge that Kejriwal himself is contesting against Modi, but in Amethi, his party has fielded a weak candidate against Rahul Gandhi as Kumar Vishwas and Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli The candidate's name has not been announced against him yet
 
 
 bijepi ke ranneetikaar maanate hai ki dilli main aam aadmi party sarkaar kii naakaami ke baavjood dilli ke baahar kai bade shaharon main yuva or madhya varg main iske prati ab bhi ek kism kaa aakarshan barkaraar he, isiilie narendra modi ko kejariwal par hamalaa kar is varg ke saamne unki 'hakeekat' rakhni padi he, taaki vot daalate samay unhen apana man banane main aasaani rahe
 
 
 Modi's strategy is also to show Kejriwal's party the 'B' team of the Congress, so that it can convince people that voting for Kejriwal means to vote for the Congress
 
 
 jaahir he, banaras main kejariwal se muqabla kar rahe modi apane virdohi ko ab halke main nahin le rahe, yah baat kam se kam unke kal ke hamalon se saaf ho jaati he
 
 
 But it remains to be seen whether Modi will continue to attack Kejriwal only if the Congress fielded a strong candidate against him in Banaras, or will his attacks on Kejriwal be confined to Benares only
 
 
 ? It seems that Chhattisgarh's BJP government is more impressed or afraid of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party
 dilli main AAP ke faislon kii tarj par chhattisgarh sarkaar bhi kuch vaise hi faisle kar rahi he
 The state government has also been involved in the elimination of VIP culture
 pradesh sarkaar 'order of presidence' ke tahat viipi ko bandook kii salaami dene kii vyavastha khatm karne ja rahi he
 That is, the 'guard of Honor' will be completely banned
 iske tahat ab kisi bhi avasar par na to rajyapal, na hi mukhyamantri or mantriyon ko bandook kii salaami di jaaegi
 The government is going to issue a new notification soon
 raman sarkaar ke in faislon ko viipi culture kii rokthaam kii shuruyaat mana ja rahaa he
 Chief Minister Raman Singh has started a struggle to change the face and face of the BJP government of the state
 is maamle main unhone dilli kii AAP sarkaar ko bhi peeche chhod diya he
 The state government has issued two toll-free numbers to teach a lesson to the corrupt people
 in nambaron ko dial kar koi bhi vyakti sidhe bhrashtachariyon or rishwat maangane waalon ke khilaaf shikaayat darj kara saktaa he
 These numbers are: 0771-4053739 and 0771- xxrep 4 2 410
 in donon nambaron par nagar nigamon, nagarpalikaon or nagar panchayaton ke alaava urban administration or development vibhaag se jude bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii shikaayat kii ja sakati he
 Chief Minister Raman Singh himself is responsible for the Municipal Administration Department
 lihaaja ve apane adheen vibhaagon main kisi bhi bhrashtachari karmchaaree ko bardaashat nahin karenge
 On the new year, Raman Singh wrote to all his ministers and told them that they should deal with corruption cases strictly
 unhone kaha tha ki mantri khud bhi paardarshita ke saath kaam karen, taaki bhrashtachar par roak lag sake
 On the other hand, the Congress is also in the grip of these decisions of the government
 vah na to in faislon kii aalochana kar paa rahi he, na hi virodh
 However, the Congress is calling these decisions a verdict gaining cheap popularity
 baharhaal, chhattisgarh sarkaar ke in faislon ne aam janata kii nigahon main thodi ummiden to jagaa hi di hai
 The death toll in Muzaffarpur in Bihar has reached 113
 pichley 24 ghante ke andar medical college main 75 nae marij bhartee hue hai
 418 children are being treated, in which the condition of many is said to be serious, but so far neither the government nor the doctors have been able to decide which disease is this
 mujffarpur or aasapaas ke ilaakon main ise chamaki kaha ja rahaa he, lekin sarkaron shaayad fursat hi nahin he ki beemaari kii asal vajah or ilaaj dhundha jaae
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reached the SKMCH hospital in Muzaffarpur early Tuesday morning, nearly 20 days after the start of death
 nitish ke pahunchane ke baad bacchon ke maa baap ko ummid thi ki unke naunihaalon ke saath hawa main tir kii tarah ho rahe ilaaj kaa kuch ilaaj hoga, dawaaen milengi, aspataal kii sehat sudharegi, lekin siem sahab kii pardedaari dekhakar logon ke sabar kaa baandh tut gaya
 People kept shouting slogans and patting the back of the Nitish Hospital administration and got out of their comfort
 chamaki bukhaar se ho rahi mauton kaa maamla supreme court tak pahunch gaya he
 Two pils have filed a PIL demanding that the Center and Bihar government be ordered to set up 500 icus in the affected areas, instructions to send medical expert teams to the affected areas and 100 mobile icus to Muzaffarpur
 iske saath hi medical board kaa gathan kiya jaae
 Meanwhile, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued a notice on Monday to the Union Health Ministry and the Bihar government to file a report on the increase in the number of deaths due to fever
 aisi reports hai ki mujffarpur ke alaava rajya ke kuch anya jile bhi isse prabhavit hue hai
 The Commission has sought a report regarding this
 saath hi yah bhi poocha ki aspataal main bhartee bacchon ko kis tarah kaa ilaaj diyaja rahaa he or peedit pariwaron ko rajya sarkaar kis tarah kii sahaayta uplabdh karai gai he
 The Commission has asked the Ministry of Health and the Government of Bihar to reply in four weeks

 The comments lagaarde ne kaha ki greece ko sudhaaron ke sambandh main do kaam karne chahie
 The first is that the country will have to take significant reformist (financial) steps and reduce the fiscal deficit; second, the debt restructuring

 sinhua ne lagaarde ke hawaale se kaha, ham mushkil daur se guzar rahe deshon ko karj dete hai
 The loans we give are conditional with various needs, but they aim to restore stability, increase growth and achieve debt sustainability
 tippaniyan Lagarde said that Greece should do two things in relation to the reforms
 pehla yah ki desh ko mahatvapurn sudhaarwadi (vittiya) kadam uthaane honge or vittiya ghaataa kam karnaa hoga, doosraa, karj kaa punarvyavasthit karnaa hoga

 At the same time, Congress seems to be successful in getting 42 percent votes of Scheduled Castes (SC) and 48 percent votes of Scheduled Tribes (ST)

 If the JDS is believed to be the beneficiary of the weakness of the JDS, then the weakening of the JDS in the state can become a major reason for the Muslim vote from the BJP

 (from input agencies) maaf kijiega ki main 66wein ganatantr diwas ko 'ganatantr' diwas kah rahaa hum, lekin kya karun, ek dashak se zyada ho gaya ganatantr diwas samaaroh main jate hue
 Every time i try to find that the common man's republic can be seen somewhere in the official glow of Rajpath
 pehle to rajpath ke kisi kone par sthit galiyaaron main kabhikbhaar aam aadmi kaa cheharaa dikh jaataa tha, lekin is baar vah bhi shaayad hi najar aae
 Yes, more than every time, this time only the gun will definitely be seen
 
 
 ek se badhkar ek
 
 
 It is heard that foreign dogs have also come to support the gun
 ganatantr kaa sidhaa matlab he gana kaa tantra, yani aam aadmi kaa system, lekin kya aam aadmi is baar najar aayega, us par kisi kaa dhyaan he
 
 
 The After all, how will he be able to see the parade, because on that day the same carriage can go towards Rajpath, which will be near the parade
 janata kii metro to suraksha kaa hawala dekar kai ghante pehle hi band kar di jaaegi
 Now that era is also over, when people from village and far countryside used to come to see the parade on foot
 haa, agar aap pradhanmantri hon yaa obama ke saath hon to koi paas nahi maangega
 All the arrangements are being made about the fact that Obama has no problem in watching the parade
 suraksha ke naam par puure rajpath kii kilabandi kar di gai he
 There is no question of the common man going to leave, because first he has to walk several kilometers from the distance to Rajpath till 6-7 am in the bitter and frostbitten cold of Delhi, then he has his own identity card
 Should be tab bhi agar vah rajpath ke aasapaas pahunch paata he to vah parade khatm hone ke antim chor par kahin khadaa ho paaegaa, jahaan vah kya dekh paaegaa, aap khud samaj jaaie
 By the way, it seems that the government also does not want more public participation on Rajpath, then only in newspapers, not on TV channels nor in the government's most popular medium of radio, advertisements are given that the common man wants This may include
 yah kehane kii jarurat nahin ki is ganatantr diwas par sabase zyada mushkil yaa pareshaani aam janata ko hone vaali he, jaise metro ko kai ghante pehle band kar dena, us vakt kai shaharon ke liye rail, bas or hawaii sevaayen band ho jaaengi
 Also, other problems will be different
 obama ke aane se desh kaa maan to badhegaa, lekin asal keemat to aam aadmi ko chukaani hogi
 When the country first celebrated Republic Day in 1950, it was truly and only common people's participation
 us vakt system, yani vyavastha kaa atapata nahin tha, lekin lagata he, jaise-jaise loktantr paripakv hota chalaa gaya, ganatantr ke is parv main tantra haaavee hota chalaa gaya or gana peeche chhutata chalaa gaya
 For the first time, tickets started selling for the Republic Day celebrations in 1962
 vaise kya ganatantr diwas jaise rashtriya parv ko janata utane hi utsaah se manaa paati he, jitna holi or diwaali jaise tyohaar manaati he
 Today, if people go out on the road, they are so harassed by the search of the closed roads, the cantonment Delhi and the heart-breaking police that they do not like to leave the house on this day
 ganatantr diwas ke maukey par hone vaale is salanaa jalse main rajpath par jahaan tamaam rajyon kii tarah-tarah kii jhaankiyaan or kalakaar apane rang bikherenge, vahiin deshbhar se chune gaye bahadur bacchon kii shaan bhi dekhte hi banegi
 The soldiers of the three armies and paramilitary forces will once again assure that the country is safe in their hands through their strength, weapons and zeal, but regrettably, the general public, for whom all this is done, will probably see it all
 Will be missing
 ab to aisa lagane laga he ki desh kaa yah sabase bada rashtriya parv kahin apni garima khokar mahaj sarkari aupchaarikta banakar na rah jaae
 The next generation should not be satisfied by watching it on television or internet
 lekin ham to chaahate hai ki chaliye rajpath par bhale hi sarkari tamzam kii vajah se aap na ja paaen, lekin jahaan kahin bhi mauka mili, khulkar ganatantr diwas manaaen
 
 
 After all, this is the biggest festival for us and for us to convert the freedom achieved after years of slavery and countless sacrifices
 desh main jab is baat ko lekar lagaataar khabaren aa rahi thim ki koun mantri banegaa, koun nahin, usee vakt yah khabar bhi aane lagi ki nitish kumaar kii janata dal united sarkaar main shaamil nahin hogi
 There were many speculations as to what had happened, but then also news came that Nitish Kumar had spoken to the Prime Minister and cleared his dilemma that his ministers would not be able to take oath
 yah bhi charchaa hone lagi ki shaayad nitish kumaar jo vibhaag chaahate the, vah vibhaag unako nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 It started with the railways or agriculture ministry, but later Nitish Kumar himself clarified the situation that he would continue to have a relationship with the BJP, but his ministers would not take oath
 yah baat bijepi adhyaksh ko bataa di gai he
 BJP President Amit Shah and PM Narendra Modi also made efforts to participate in jdu's government but Nitish Kumar did not agree
 ve shaadi main shaamil us foofa kii tarah bane rahe to baat-baat par naaraaz ho jaataa he
 He pounced and did not agree to make any one of his party's MP a minister
 iske peeche kuch unki duvidha he to kuch majaburi bhi he
 After all, what were the reasons that forced Nitish Kumar to take this step
 pehali vajah he jediu ko keval ek cabinet kaa pad dena
 Nitish Kumar said that when the Akali Dal has two mps and is getting a ministerial post and Ramvilas Paswan's party has six mps and is getting a cabinet post, the JDU has 16 mps, On what basis is he being given the same cabinet minister position
 jediu kam se kam ek or swatantra prabhaar kaa mantralay chaah rahaa tha, magar unki baat nahin bani
 Nitish Kumar also got a call from the Prime Minister, but the matter did not work
 vajah saaf he, yadi nitish kumaar ek cabinet mantri kii baat maan lete or jaisi charchaa thi ki ramchandra prasad singh ko mantri banaaya jaataa to nitish kumaar ke liye bihar main ek ajeeb si sthiti paidaa ho jaati
 People used to say that Nitish Kumar made a leader a minister from his caste, ie Kurmi
 nitish kumaar ko laga ki isse bihar ke agadi jati ke log naaraaz ho sakate hai, isliye ve chaahate the ki aaaraseepi singh ke saath lalan singh, jo bhoomihaar jati se aate hai, ko bhi mantri banaaya jaae
 So that they can maintain the balance of castes in Bihar
 yahi vajah he ki nitish kumaar ne is pachade main padana uchit nahin samajha or apni party ko shapath grahan se alag rakhaa
 Assembly elections are due in Bihar in the coming days and in view of that, Nitish is busy planning his strategy
 chunaav ke dauraan bhi nitish kumaar vande maataram jaise mudde par asahaj dikhe the
 He avoided raising his hands during the slogans of Vande Mataram
 puure chunaav prachaar ke dauraan ve media se bhi bachate rahe
 BJP also likes this situation in Bihar
 is loksabhaa chunaav main prachand jeet ke baad bihar bijepi ke netaa ab yah kehane lage hai ki aglaa chunaav ab akele hi lard liya jaae
 That is, the BJP also lacks leaders who dream of becoming Chief Minister in Bihar
 unhen lagata he ki bihar main bijepi itani majboot ho chuki he ki vah apane dam par lard sakati he
 53 to NDA in Bihar in this election
 25 fisadi vot mili jisamen se bijepi ko 23
 58 per cent and JDU 21
 8 fisadi vot mili
 According to this election, jdu's vote was 16 as compared to the last time ie 2014
 04 fisadi se badhkar 21
 8 percent while bjp's vote was 29
 40 fisadi se ghatakar 23
 58 percent
 yahi baat bijepi netaaon ko chubh rahi he
 Many BJP leaders view Nitish Kumar with suspicion because the opposition people in Bihar also call Nitish Kumar as Palatu Kumar
 kai bijepi netaaon ko lagata he ki jediu unke sahare aage bad rahi he
 It is now to see what strategy BJP and JDU adopt in the next assembly elections
 bihar main abhi bhi rajya ko special darja nahin diya janaa or aarthik package nahin milanaa bhi ek mudda he
 That is, what Nitish Kumar is doing in view of the politics of Bihar can have many deep political meanings
 isliye aage aage dekhie nitish babu kya-kya kadam uthaate hai jo aapako chaunkaate rahenge
 Army Chief General Bibpin is working on a massive restructuring plan in Rawatsena

 JNU students reacted to the Nobel Prize: Abhijeet Banerjee, the first student of JNU to get the Nobel Prize, India's national economist Abhijit Banerjee has won the nation's stature all over the world
 vahiin, rajdhani dilli ke jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay (JNU) main bhi har kheme main khushi kii lahar he
 Aajtak after this award
 in ne campus kii pratikriya lee
 Most of the students said that they hope that this award will change the negative attitude of the people against JNU
 jeenyu main padhe abhijit banerjee 1981 main arthshaastra padhane ke liye campus main aae the
 Abhijeet Banerjee also had to go to jail for 10 days due to his involvement in the struggle while studying here
 jeenyu ke chaatro kaa kahana he ki unke bich ke ek chaatr ko nobel puraskaar milanaa haal hi main vishvavidhyalay ke khilaaf uthe vivaad ko lekar logon ke man main bane nazariye ko badalane main madadgaar hoga
 Rajendra Sharma, a phd in Hindi literature from JNU in the year 1980 and currently editor of Communist Party mouthpiece Lok Lehar, aajtak
 in se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki abhijit banerjee ko nobel puraskaar milanaa is sarkaar ko ek jawaab he
 Rajendra Sharma says that in 1983, against the change in the rules for easy access to poor and backward students in JNU, the students had staged at the then JNU Vice Chancellor's residence for 2 days after which more than 100 students were given about 10 days
 He was arrested and sent to Tihar Jail
 rajendra sharma kehete hai ki abhijit banerjee kisi vichaardhaara yaa chaatr sanghathan se jude hue nahin the
 Even then, he may have been a part of the movement for the poor and socially backward people, but during the 10 days of imprisonment in Tihar Jail, he had probably seen the social reality very closely
 rajendra sharma kehete hai ki abhijit banerjee nobel paane vaale jeenyu ke pehle chaatr to hai hi, saath hi wo tihaad ke aise pehle kaidi bhi hai jinhen nobel puraskaar se nawaja gaya he
 Regarding the recently raised controversies against JNU, JNU alumnus Rajendra Sharma says that this is a befitting reply to those who spread the controversy
 professor abhijit banerjee JNU ke centre for iconomics studies and planning main padhate the
 This old campus of JNU is now under the control of CISF but the group of existing teachers in the new building of the new campus considers their contribution commendable
 isi centre for ichonamik studies and planning main shikshak professor himanshu kehete hai ki shiksha or activism jeenyu kii samskruti or parampara rahi he
 Here one gets freedom to think more and more
 abhijit banerjee ko nobel puraskaar milanaa yuva chaatro ke saath saath sampurna adhyaapan varg ke liye ek protsaahan dene vaali khabar he
 Himanshu says that the controversies surrounding JNU are purely political and the people who teach and do not believe in him because the reputation of Jawaharlal Nehru University remains intact and topped the national rankings
 chaatro ne di aisi pratikriyaayembhijit banerjee ko nobel puraskaar milanaa jeenyu ke chaatro ke liye sabase badi khabar he kyonki unhen lagata he ki anti neshnal kaa tag lagaae gaye jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main padhane vaale chaatro par ab koi ungali nahin uthayega
 Kalyan Sonwal, a resident of Assam, is a research scholar of media studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University and believes that a JNU student receiving the Nobel Prize is a befitting reply to the powers and organizations that tarnish jnu's reputation
 dilli kii rahane vaali jeenyu kii chaatr saloni kaa kahana he ki chaatr raajnneeti mahatvapurn he, ise badhaava diya janaa chahie kyonki abhijit banerjee ko bhi 10 dinon tak jail main rahanaa padaa tha
 After all, how many diamonds, including economists, sociologists, historians, have been given to the country in this university
 jeenyu main kathith narebaaji ke aaropon ke baad lage deshadroh ke tag par saloni kahati hai, "samaaj ke liye jawaharlal vishvavidhyalay kaa yogadan saraahneey he or hamen aise kai sansthaaon kii jarurat he jise anti neshnal kaaryon ke aarope main badnaam kiya ja rahaa he
 There is ability within it and we need more such institutions
 "jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay kii research scollar saloni apana anubhav saajha karte hue kahati hai ki vivaad uthne ke baad unhen doston or samaaj ke bich khud ko jeenyu kaa chaatr kehete hue kaaphi mushkil hoti thi kyonki logon kii maansikta badalanaa ek badi chunauti thi
 But now Saloni hopes that a student who comes out of the same Jawaharlal Nehru University to get the Nobel Prize will definitely change people's attitude and attitude towards this university and its students in the society
 saloni ne ajtak se kaha ki kabhi mujhe ghanton tak apane parivaar ko doston ko or rishtedaaron ko puure vivaad par safai deni padati thi or unhen kahati thi aisa kuch nahin he balki saare vivaad farji hai lekin ab is nobel puraskaar ke baad mujhe ummid he ki unki maansikta jarur badalegi
 Kaushik Importance, a student from West Bengal, Purulia, who has done an mphil in social medicine at Jawaharlal Nehru University, also says that the Nobel Prize is actually a befitting reply to the government
 kowshik mahato ne baatcheet main nobel puraskaar par apni khushi jaahir karte hue kaha ki pichley paanch-chah saalon main jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay par anti-national hone kaa tag laga diya gaya
 Abhijeet Banerjee himself was also in jail for 10 days for raising his voice against the Vice Chancellor, today he is getting a Nobel answer to this government
 Student politics is important in every university
 uttar pradesh ke jonpur main rahane vaale or jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay se paryaavaran science main piechdi kar rahe pramod kaa kahana he ki unke liye bhi yah garv kaa mauka he
 But he also remembers the time when he had difficulty facing his family and society after the controversy over sloganeering in JNU
 jeenyu lagaataar samaaj main apana yogadan detaa rahaa he jabase isaki sthapana hui he lekin jab se yahaan nae vaais chancelar niyukt hue hai jeenyu kii pratishtha ko rokane kii kai koshishen hui hai
 After the controversy arose, there was a problem in explaining this to the family and the people of the village because they used to ask us whether you had gone to JNU or shouted slogans
 tab ham kehete the ki aaie or dekhie ham yahaan padhate hai yaa kya karte hai
 Om, who lives in Madhepura, Bihar, is also studying from JNU
 om kehete hai ki jeenyu sarkaar ke khilaaf nahin he balki sarkaar kii un nitiyon ke khilaaf he jo samaaj or desh ke hit main nahin he isliye use sarkaar virdohi nahin maananaa chahie
 All the students of JNU like Om believe that the university which had the reputation of being anti-national, the students of the university who were accused of being anti-national and the campus of the university which were accused of anti-national slogans
 aaj usee vishvavidhyalay se nikle ek chaatr ko duniya kaa sabase bada sammaan milane ke baad naa sirf logon kii maansikta badalegi balki jeenyu ke prati logon kaa najariya bhi sakaaratmak hoga

 iske liye samay tay kar charchaa kii jaaegi
 But Naidu insisted on immediate discussion
 unki party ke anya sadasyon ne unki maang kaa samarthan kiya
 Since 2005, six terror attacks have taken place in Uttar Pradesh, investigation has been done, chargesheets have been filed against the accused but during the court hearing the case was so weak that many of the accused were acquitted
 police ne jinhen gavaah banaaya unhone hi aparaadhiyon ko pahchaanane se inkaar kar diya
 All this is the result of the police's poor investigation, immediate arrest
 isamen police ke prashikshan or karmchaariyon kii kami kaa bhi kam yogadan nahin he
 Consider the hallmark of the police's poor investigation: On November 23, 2007, 9 people were killed and many were injured in bomb blasts in the court premises in Lucknow, Faizabad and Banaras
 22 disambar, 2007 ko 'special task force' (estf) ne barabanki railway stesan se azamgarh ke thana rani kii sarai nivasee mohammad khalid mujahid or jonpur ke madiyaahuun nivasee tarik kazmi ko baari visphotak saamagree ke saath giraftaar kiya
 The STF also got information about his other colleagues - Sajjadur Rahman and Muhammad Tariq
 kathith taur par unhen jammu-kashmir police ne giraftaar kar 26 disambar, 2007 ko estf ke hawaale kar diya
 These accused claimed responsibility for the blast in the courts of Lucknow and Faizabad and a case was filed before the police officers on the basis of confession
 aatank nirodhak dasta (aties) ke tatkaaleen kshetradhikari rajesh shrivastav ne adaalat main aaropapatr daakhil kiya
 How well the police prosecution against the terrorists can be gauged from the fact that 30 of the 31 witnesses presented in the court of the third Additional District and Sessions Judge of Faizabad, who are hearing the bomb blast case in Faizabad
 The accused of the incident have refused to be identified
 gavaahon kaa kahana tha ki unhone nyaayalay main maujuud aatankiyon ko pehle kabhi nahin dekha he
 According to the court action documents held by India Today, a witness seeing the accused Tariq Kazmi present in the court said that he was the one who placed the bomb in a bicycle in the court premises
 haalanki us gavaah ke bayaan ne itane gambhir maamle main police kii laaparvaahee kii pole bhi kholi
 According to the charge sheet of the police, the bomb was not placed in the Faizabad court by Kazmi
 vah adaalat ke get par maujuud tha or imran tathaa tarik kashmiri ne court parisar main bam rakhaa tha
 However, a senior ATAS officer handling the case is not ready to believe that the witnesses presented in the court have denied seeing the terrorists
 abhiyukton ko sajaa dilwane ke liye police kii sanjidagi kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ijaajat milane ke baavjood aties ke vivechna adhikari ne abhiyukton kaa dand prakriya samhita (siarpisi) ke anuchhed 164 ke tahat ikbaalia bayaan darj nahin karaayaa
 Not only this, despite the permission from the court, no 'lie detector test' was conducted nor was a parade organized to strengthen the witnesses against them
 aties ke ek varisht adhikari daleel dete hai ki supreme court ne bagaiyr abhiyukt kii rajamandi ke narco test na karaane kaa aadesh de rakhaa he
 For this reason, the accused were not 'tested'
 adaalat main aatankiyon ke khilaaf sangeen aatanki vaardaat kii dhili pulisia tafteesh kii pairvi kar rahe sarkari vakeelon ko bhi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Additional District Government Assistant Advocate (criminal) Virender Maurya admits, "it is certain that the arrested accused have executed the incident in the Faizabad court but the police investigation has a lot of shortcomings
" gavaah abhiyukton ko nahin pahchaan rahe jisase pairvi main dikkatein aa rahi hai
 Maurya, angered by the police action, says, "even if all the evidence against the terrorists is found, it is not possible to connect them together
" '' haalanki is maamle main ummid kii ek kiran bhi he
 Maurya says that the police raided the house of accused Kazmi and recovered some literature and two mobile phones without a SIM
 baraamad mobile phone ke iemiai number se pataa chalaa ki unase jammu-kashmir ke ek aatanki se lagaataar baatcheet ho rahi thi
 On the other hand, in December 2007, the army killed the terrorist and a phone call from him revealed that he had spoken to Kazmi several times
 maury bataate hai, ''abhiyukton ke khilaaf saboot jutaney ke liye is kadi ko joda ja rahaa he
 The colonel who killed the terrorist has been summoned by the court
 ''aatanki vaardaat hote hi police sakriy ho jaati he or maamle ko aanan-fanan sulajhane kaa daawa karti he
 Police claims of capturing terrorists are also under suspicion
 estf kaa daawa he ki usne kazmi ko barabanki police stesan se 22 disambar, 2007 ko visphotak saamagree ke saath pakadaa, jabaki adaalat main die gaye bayaan main kazmi kaa kahana he ki estf ne use 12 disambar, '07 ko tab pakadaa jab vah azamgarh se sarai mir ja rahaa tha
 On December 14, '07, Baba Azhar of Kazmi gave a tahrir at Rani Sahai, Thana, Azamgarh, that his grandson was picked up by some
 vahiin duusari ore barabanki se giraftaar kiye gaye abhiyukt khalid mujahid ne bhi court ko bataaya ki 16 disambar, 2007 ko kuch log use madiyaahuun se uthaakar le gaye the

 darapuri kehete hai, ''kisi aatanki ghatana ko jaldi kholane kii garaj se police galat taur-tareeke bhi apanaati he
 For example, she presents some people as accused whom she has already caught
 sangerpur main bahut saare yuvak abhi bhi gaayab hai or inke parivaar vaale baar-baar aisi ashanka jataa chuke hai
 "on the basis of the confessional statement of such accused, the police decimate the incident, when there is no evidence
" darapuri bataate hai, ''galat dhang se pakade gaye abhiyukton ko police apni baat kehane kaa mauka nahin detii kyonki use dar hota he ki kahin abhiyukt apane bayaan se mukar na jaae
 This is the reason that the police get applause after opening the incident but its case in the court gets weakened
 '' police ke bade aalaa adhikari 'on ricard' par kuch bolne ko taiyaar nahin
 There are some other holes in the police investigation
 lakhanu kaa visphot maamuli tha
 The fingerprints found on the pieces of the bomb there were matched to the accused but they did not match the fingerprints of any of the accused, while in Faizabad where the blast and dust after the court blast showed nothing and the bomb They were torn to pieces, yet the fingerprints found on them matched the fingers of the accused Khilad Mujahid and Akhtar
 is par aties ke adhikari kii daleel he ki faijabad main bam ke kuch tukade kisi cheez ke neeche dabe the jis vajah se in par dhul nahin jam pai or ungaliyon ke nishaan surakshit rahe
 Will the defense not flout such an argument? Apart from the lax attitude of the police in punishing the culprits, some people consider the law also responsible

 gupta aatanki ghatnaon kii lachar vivechna or court main gavaahon ke abhiyukton ko na pahchaanane ke peeche aparaadh nyaay vyavastha ko doshi tehraate hai
 They say that due to the long time it takes in the legal process, many times witnesses are not able to stand on their point
 unhen abhiyukton se to dar hota hi he, saath main police in gavaahon ko koi suraksha nahin muhaiyaa karaati
 Gupta says, "unless the number of judges increases, necessary steps like empowering the police will not be taken, the crime justice system will not be strong
" natijatan kanoonee karrwai main lanbaa arsa lagegaa
 Advocate Muhammad Shoaib, who is representing the accused, demands the trial in the fast track court
 baharhaal yah tay he ki aatanki ghatnaon kii vivechna main police ko jitani sakriyata or gambhirtha baratani chahie vah nahin barti gai he
 This is the reason that so far the culprits of any terrorist incident in the state have not been punished
 police ne jin logon ko aatanki bataakar pakadaa unhen adaalat ne sabooton ke abhaav main bari kar diya
 The police needs many types of training for this

 In order to prepare an action plan to remove the encroachment, the order to file an affidavit in two days, the Delhi High Court has also taken a tough stand after the Supreme Court's strict comment on the pollution

 The court has asked to file an affidavit in two days

 dilli hai court ne rajya sarkaar ke department of forest and wild life se kaha ki wo atikaraman hataane ke liye ection plan taiyaar kare or special task force ko isamen lagaae
 What the Department of Forest said in the court Actually, the Department of Forest and Wildlife said in the Nehai Court that trees were planted in Delhi from 15 February to 15 October
 abhi or ped nahin lagaae ja sakate
 For this, the department argued that trees should already be planted on every side and said that trees have been planted everywhere in the forest area

 Encroachment on how many hectares of land, the Forest Department told the court that there is considerable encroachment on 317 hectares of land

 unka team main hona hameshaa acha rahaa lekin ab vah team main nahin hai or isliye hamen apane kaam par dhyaan kendrit karnaa hoga
 We have moved forward by accepting this truth
 ' This is the first time since November 1996 that neither Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman and Sourav Ganguly feature in the Indian batting line-up
 bharat ne england or australia main pichhali donon shrunkhalaaon main sabhi match ganvaaen haalanki gharelu sarajameen par usne lagaataar jeet darj kii
 Dhoni said, 'every series is a new beginning
there is no point in putting extra burden on khud par atirikt boj daalane kaa koi tuk nahin banataa he
 It is to keep pace with the circumstances and play according to the need of the team
 team main kai yuva khilaadi hai jinhen test str par pratispardhi cricket khilne kaa mauka milegaa
 So this is a very positive aspect for us
 ' Dhoni said, "in Benoni we could bat on the first day and ask the opposing team to field on the wet outfield
" lekin aisa karnaa sahi nahin hota kyonki unka bhi pratham shrenee satr chal rahaa he
 Nobody wants to get hurt so it was good for both the teams that the match was canceled
 hamane wicket par abhyaas kiya or uskaa adhik se adhik phayda uthaane kii koshish kii
 ' ek-divasiy shrunkhlaa main lachar pradarshan ke bare main dhoni ne kaha ki choti shrunkhlaa hone ke kaaran unhen vaapasi kaa mauka nahin mila
 He said, 'we were confident of a good performance in the one-day series as well, but in the first two matches we played many shots and often the ball went to the fielder
 yah niraashajanak he, lekin choti shrunkhlaa main aapke paas vaapasi kaa mauka nahin hota he
 ' dhoni ne kaha, 'lekin hamen us shrunkhlaa se kaaphi kuch seekhney ko mila
 Such as where to pitch the ball and which ball to leave when batting
 isliye kul milakar hamaari taiyaariyaan acchhee hai or ab keval alag alag khilaadiyon ko paristhitiyon ke hisaab se khelnaa he
 ' bhartiya captain ne wanders ke wicket ke bare main kaha, 'yahaan kaa wicket shuru main nishchit taur par tej gendbaajon ko madad karegaa
 The bowlers have got a good length here as they played one-day matches here
 isliye nai gend se behatar gendbaaji karnaa mahatvapurn he
 Initially getting wickets can put pressure on the middle order
 ' Dhoni did not mention the playing XI, but indicated that his two bowlers would play an important role
 unhone kaha, 'madhyakram ke hamaare ballebaajon ne gharelu cricket or jab bhi unhen antarrashtriya str par khilne kaa mauka mila tab unhone acha pradarshan kiya he
 This is a new challenge for him and he will now get a lot of experience playing Test cricket outside India
 ' Dhoni hopes that in addition to leading the bowling, veteran Zaheer Khan will also learn young fast bowlers
 unhone kaha, 'jahir ko kaaphi anubhav he
 Along with this, he will also act as a guide for the young bowlers while leading the bowling
 aswin kii bhoomika bhi mahatvapurn hogi kyonki unhen yahaan upmahadweep jaisi madad nahin milegi
 The way he bowls in the first innings will be different from bowling in the second innings here
 ' Dhoni said of the batting, 'when we were part of the senior team, we were not very much concerned about the preparations because you know your game and in different circumstances by playing international cricket for a long time
 ' He said, 'he (sachin, Rahul, Laxman) has visited England, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand many times so his original preparations were complete
 lekin yuva khilaadiyon ko yah bhi bataanaa hota he ki unhen kya karne kii jarurat he or kin vibhaagon main sudhaar kii jarurat he
 ' dhoni se poocha gaya ki number chaar par koun ballebaaji karegaa, 'intjaar karo or dekho

 The BJP, which fought the battle of Ram Janmabhoomi, has been in controversy over the birthplace of Sita Mata
 sitamarhi ko lekar kendriya mantri mahesh sharma ke die gaye bayaan ko lekar raajnneeti tej ho gai he
 The BJP is on the back foot with the statement of the Union Minister regarding the birthplace of Mata Sita in Sitamarhi
 vahiin duusari taraf janata dal you is mudde ko hawa dene main lagi he
 Arjun Rai, a former Janata Dal u MP from Sitamarhi, has blown a concoction over the controversial statement of the minister, and has started a march demanding the dismissal of Union Minister Mahesh Sharma
 kendriya samskruti evam paryaton mantri mahesh sharmaane rajyasabha main kaha ki sitamarhi bas aasthaa or vishwaas kaa centre he
 Archaeological Survey of India has not found any such evidence due to which Sitamarhi should be considered as the birthplace of Sita
 mahesh sharma madhyapradesh ke bijepi saansad prabhaat jha ke sawaal kaa jawaab de rahen the
 Prabhat Jha is a native of Sitamarhi
 raajnneeti bhi ajeeb cheez he jo bijepi mandir kii raajnneeti karti he wo sita mata ke janmasthan ko lekar baikfoot par he
 At the same time, the Janata Dal, which used to accuse the BJP of spreading communalism by doing temple politics, is doing a march on the birth place of Mother Sita
 purv saansad arjuna raay ne mujffarpur ke majhauli se sitamarhi ke chorout tak kii padayatra shuru kii he unke saath hajaaron log is padayatra main shaamil he
 This padyatra will last for four days
 purv saansad ne bataaya ki bijepi ram kaa naam lekar chunaav ladati he or raajnneeti karti he vahiin bijepi ke mantri mata sita kaa apmaan kar rahen hai
 In the presence of the Prime Minister, he said about the birthplace of Mother Sita, that the birth of Sita was said that it is not certain purv saansad ne kaha ki jabatak kendriya mantri mahesh sharma ko barkhaast nahin kiya jaataa tabatak unka ye abhiyaan jari rahegaa

 After the order of the Supreme Court, the 13 children who were given admission by the famous City Montessori School of Lucknow, are now shying away from teaching them
 skool ne supreme court se kaha ki lakhanu main or bhi skool hai jo bacchon ke ghar se zyada kareeb he, jahaan in bacchon ko bheja ja saktaa he
 On this, the Supreme Court said in a tearful manner, 'children are not football to be thrown from here to there
 'shiksha ke adhikaar kanoon ke tahat sarkari, gaiyrsarkari auranijee skulonko garib bacchon ko 25 fisadi siten dene kaa niyam he
 But the City Montessori School, which is included in the prestigious and expensive school, refused admission to poor children, saying that there are many more schools in Lucknow where children can get admission then why only Montessori School
 lekin supreme court ne kuch maheene pehle ye aadesh diya ki montesri skool 13 garib bacchon ko admician den or unhen padhaayein
 After this order, the school gave admission but the school reached the Supreme Court
 skool kii taraf se peshwarisht vakiobhishek manu singhvin ne court ke saamne tark diya ki lakhanu main kai or skool hai jo in garib bacchon ke gharon ke paas hai
 So these children can be shifted to those schools
 haalanki isi bich upi sarkaar ke vakil em shamashaad ne saaf shabdon main kaha ki bacchon ko skool se baahar nahin niklaa janaa chahie
 The UP government has decided to keep the children in the commonsery school itself
 skool ke ravaiye se naaraaz court ne kaha ki 'bachche footbal nahin hai jinhen idhar se udhar phenkaa jaaai
 'the court has asked both the school and the UP government to give a written reply
 RJ syma
 Hey, the same radio jockey of Radio Mirchi who brings many shows for all of us on Radio Mirchi
 jaise puraani genes, phir kya hua, manto siries, meri diary kaa ek pej
 In old jeans, she tells us old-fashioned melody songs
 or hamaare saath khub sari baaten bhi share karti hai
 a very funny thing with him is that he is also a literature lover
 sahitya aaj tak main aa rahi hai 12-13 november ko
 So we interviewed them: 1
 aapkaa sabase pasandida riter koun he?mere fevorett riter hai sahadat hasan manto
 i also ran a series of stories of Manto on Radio Mirchi
 jo ki radio kii first evar ‘manto siries’ thi
 Which people liked a lot
 sahadat hasan manto ne sabase pehle radio par hi apni kahaniyaan pard ke sunai thim
 He did this even before partition
 us samay sirfol india radiohua karata tha
 Similarly, i also read Manto's stories on Radio Mirchi
 har friday kii raat ko ham manto kii kahaniyaan lekar aate the
 The special thing about Manto was that he used to write in an absurd manner
 bahut se riter itane bebaak dhang se nahin likh pate hai
 Manto is not just a writer for me
 mere liye wo ek kaaynaat hai
 Manto has a story that never comes out of my mind
 us kahani kaa naam he ‘khol do’
 As soon as i read 'open', i feel fearless and every day, as much as Nirbhaya is made in India and all over the world, i stand before my eyes
 phir aisa lagata he ki vakt to gujara he par halaat vahi hai
 2
 aapkaa regular sho aata he radio mirchi par ‘puraani genes’
 In which you recite old songs to people
 to koun-koun se geetkaar hai jinaki rachanaaen aapako acchhee lagati hai?mujhe geetkaaron main shailendra bahut achche lagate hai
 Sahir Ludhianvi looks very good
 mujhe niraj ke geet or kavitaayen behad pasand hai
 And among today's lyricists i like Irshad Kamil, Amitabh Bhattacharya, Javed Akhtar, Gulzar very much
 inke geeton ke lafj bahut hi khubasurat hote hai
 Mahakumbh of literature lines will be held in Delhi on 12-13, see full schedule 3
 aap aaj ke hindi ke lekhakon main kise padhati hai ?aaj ke hindi riters kii baat kii jaae to gulzaar ne jo kahaniyaan likhi hai wo mujhe bahut pasand he
 The rest i think that those who were Hindi writers of the previous generation, they had better writing
 mujhe gulzaar kii kitaab “raavi paar” meri favorit he
 Which is a story of a mother and child
 raavi paar kitaab main partishan kii traasadee he, jisame ek maa apane judawaan bacchon ko lekar train ke upar baithi hui ja rahi he
 a child dies of a cold
 jise log raavi nadi main bahaane ke liye kehete hai or wo use baha detii he
 On arriving at the hideout, it is revealed that the alive child was swept away while he was sleeping and was stuck with the dead
 baaki ye acchhee kitaab he, aapako bhi padhani chahie
 4
 agar sahitya kii baat kii jaae, likhane kii baat kii jaae, to aapane kya sab likhaa he abhi tak?dekhiye, main kahaniyaan to nahin likhti
 But i do write a diary
 jise main roj apane sho main sunaati hum
 There is also a segment in my show called "one page of my diary"
 or abhi jo maine letest “meri diary kaa ek pej” kiya he
 You can see it by going to my Facebook page
 jisaki line kuch is tarah hai:sahitya aaj tak: dilli main 12-13 november ko jutenge kalam ke diggaj, jaane kaise karen registration“meraa aaj kaa pej
 Page color white, white
 kya ho gaya he hamen, kyon itane jajmental or aalochanatmak ho gaye hai ham, kyon agar koi ham jaisaa nahin to wo bura he
 Why if his thinking is different from us then he is of less intelligence
 kyon agar wo kuch alag kahata he to galat kahata he
 Why he wants someone else is fake
 kyon wo apni soch-vichaar main kisi or ke saath he to hamaare khilaaf he
 We may have forgotten that God has made every person different from us
 wo hamase alag he har tarah se
 Sometimes we can find ourselves in him and in him he can probably see the image of himself
 magar itnaa hi
 
 bas itnaa hi
 
 kabhi wo hamaara aainaa jarur ban saktaa he, lekin yaad rahe aainaa saamne vaale kaa gulam nahin hota
 There is one more world beyond that mirror
 jahaan ek or duniya basati he
 Perhaps we have forgotten to look beyond that mirror

 At least 1000 people of the community in Banaskantha district have expressed their desire to adopt Buddhism in view of the beating of Dalits in Una
 unka kahana he ki yadi unase barabari kaa vyavhaar nahin kiya jaataa he, to hindu dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 These members of the Dalit community have filled the form, in which they have given their consent for conversion
 is form ko jald hi sarkaar ke adhikariyon ko saunpa jayega
 Meanwhile, various Dalit organizations have decided to hold a community rally here on July 31 in Ahmedabad, to determine the roadmap for their movement
 sthaneey dalit netaa evam bidies sachiv dinesh makvaana ne kaha, 'una ghatana ko lekar puure rajya ke dalit kaaphi dukhi hai
 It shows that we still have discrimination and various atrocities in the name of caste, religion and profession
 isliye banaaskantha se kai daliton ne buddha dharm apnaane kii ichha jataai he
 Comments unhone kaha, 'gat teen dinon ke dauraan yahaan pradarshan reliyon main hajaaron daliton ne hissaa liya
 In the meetings, we came to the conclusion that if we do not behave equally then there is no point in living in Hinduism
 isliye hamane daliton main farm vitarit kiye jo dharm badalanaa chahen
 So far, we have received 1,000 such forms
 ' (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) dalit samudaay ke in sadasyon ne form bharaa he, jisamen unhone dharmantaran ke liye apni sahmati di he
 This form will soon be handed over to government officials
 is bich vibhinn dalit sanghathanon ne yahaan ahmedabad main 31 july ko samudaay kii ek raily yojit karne kaa nirnay kiya he, jisamen unke andolan ke aage kii ruparekha tay kii jaaegi
 Local Dalit leader and BDS secretary Dinesh Makwana said, “dalits from all over the state are deeply saddened by the Una incident
 yah dikhaata he ki hamase abhi bhi bhedbhaav or jati, dharm or peshey ke naam par vibhinn atyaachaar hote hai
 Therefore many Dalits from Banaskantha have expressed their desire to adopt Buddhism
 'tippaniyan He said, 'during the last three days thousands of Dalits took part in protest rallies here

 Neither the manufacturers nor the buyers are excited about the announcement of reducing the GST on electric vehicles from 12 percent to 5 percent in the budget to woo car makers and the announcement of income tax reduction on the purchase of electric vehicles for prospective buyers Huh
 sarkaar ke 2030 ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye electric vaahanon ko bade paimaane par bazaar main utaarna hoga or iske liye jitne bade nivesh kii jarurat he use dekhte hue car udyog ke saamne latakaai gai jiesti kii gaajar naakaafi he
 The ambition of the government to convert almost one-third of the cars running on the roads to electric cars cannot be called a small goal
 usee tarah karon main katautee kaa vaada bhi kharidaaron ko kuch khaas nahin lubhaa sakegaa
 Electric cars are twice as expensive as diesel / petrol cars
 masalan britain main electric hundai konaa apane terbo-charge petrol ingine kii tulana main 75 pratishat adhik mahangi he, jisamen atyaadhunik dual-klach, automatic gearbox he
 Therefore, a lot will have to be done to make e-cars an option in a price-sensitive market like India
 viksit arthvyavasthaaon main logon kaa rujhaan electric kaaron main badhaane ke liye kai tarah ke protsaahan die gaye hai
 From fairly good initial subsidies to very low insurance fees and registration rates; Exclusive lane facilities for electric cars during rush hours; Free Reservoir Parking Spot; Subsidized electricity; Free charging arrangements in public places; And breathtaking offers such as free use of toll roads are offered
 masalan, norge main acchhee electric car kii keemat sabhi vaarshik sadak karon, saarvajanik parking shulk, toll or bas len kaa upyog karne kii chhot ke atirikt laabh ke baavjood usee aakaar ke hazbek car ke baraabar baithti he
 Even if the initial price barrier is lowered and its prices hover around the petrol vehicle, buyers will remain 'apprehensive' about the density and expansion of the charging infrastructure for these cars
 is buniyadi dhaanche ke nirmaan kii dhimi pragati ab bhi chintaa kaa vishay he
 It has taken nearly a century to practically enable the existing infrastructure of personal / public traffic on the road
 us trephic ke ek-tihaai ko ek dashak main tabhi badla ja saktaa he jab uske samanaantar buniyadi dhaancha viksit ho or iske liye ek bade drushtikon, vrihad vyaavhaarik yojanaon, nitigat protsaahan or vyavsaayik model kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 To understand another challenge, consider this fact: a conventional diesel / petrol car tank takes five minutes to fill, a CNG vehicle's tank takes 10 minutes to fully fill, while charging an electric car Takes at least 30 minutes
 ab aap kalpana kiijie ki kitne charging steshnon kii jarurat padegi
 a DC charging point of 50 kw will require special infrastructures
 yahaan tak ki ve parivaar jinhen parking main charging point uplabdh honge ve bhi raat bhar main puraa charge kar paane main shaayad hi sakasham ho saken
 From the manufacturing point of view, the biggest cost of an electric car will be its battery pack
 testla ne newada main apana gigafactory 1 banaaya jo ki mukhya rup se bydaree pack kii uski aantarik maang ko puraa karne ke liye tha; panasonic jisaki badariyon ke nirmaan ke liye testla ke saath saajhedaari he, ne gigafactory main 1
 Announced an initial investment of $ 6 billion and increased the target to $ 3 to invest in Gigafactory
 86 arab dollar ke bond jari kiye
 At the moment, there are no battery-pack manufacturers in India; The first company to supply the battery to Maruti Suzuki will also take a few more years to start its full production
 bharat main koun gigafactory lagayegaa? kya yah desh ke saarvajanik upakramon main se ek hoga yaa phir shaayad korian diggaj company ho sakati he? isse pehle sarkaar ko bijli chaalit gadipoon ke liye ek spasht rodmap taiyaar karnaa hoga
 It has set its goals against its will
 na keval motor vaahan udyog sikud rahaa he, balki nirmaataaon or eendhan companiyon ne haal hi main kathor utsarjan or suraksha mandandon ko apnaane ke liye bade nivesh kiye hai
 It is hardly possible for them to move towards electric vehicles at the moment

 The Afghanistan team players also wanted to play during the Indian Premier League but they have not found any buyer so far

 He said that the President of Afghanistan will possibly discuss this issue during his visit to India next week
 unhone kaha, ‘yadi bharat hamen ek home ground detaa he to yah hamaare cricktaron ke liye bahut badi madad hogi
 Our players are good, they just need facilities and exposure through the camp

 But there were lines of worry

 Some were saying that if the party would form the government with 130 seats, some were talking about 120 seats

 Something similar happened the next day

 The BJP, which missed out on a majority of eight seats, will be said to have lost its misfortune by a margin of less than 2,500 votes in eight seats
 duusari taraf congress kaa aankada 122 siton se ghatakar 78 rah gaya
 If we understand the difference of this election between the two parties in a little detail, the vote percentage of Congress has been slightly more than BJP
 bhaajapa ko jahaan 36
 Congress got 37 percent with 2 percent votes
 9 pratishat vot praapt kiye
 But due to better electoral machinery at the ground level and better electoral management of party president Amit Shah and his team, while the party won 104 seats, the Congress was reduced to 78 even after securing a higher vote percentage
 beshak, sattadhari congress sarkaar ke khilaaf maahaul ne bhaajapa ko badhat hasil karne main kaaphi madad kii
 Nevertheless, it has to be said that it is amazing the strength of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah that the power of the 21st state of the country has fallen in the party's bag

 In public meetings, the Prime Minister attacked the Congress, specifically targeting Rahul Gandhi as well as Siddaramaiah, whom he addressed as Mr
 10 percent and symbolized corruption
 jabaki party kaaryakartaaon ke liye apane sambodhan main unhone isse ekadam alag rukh rakhaa or unhen sarkaar ke prayaason se parichit karaane par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 Like what the government is thinking for the poor, what it is doing, how the BJP at the center is reforming the administrative system to eliminate corruption and poverty, the two biggest problems facing the country
