 In an important decision, the Chhattisgarh High Court has not only made a sharp comment on the erstwhile DME in the case of wrongful admission of his daughter and her friend to the medical college, but has dismissed all the petitions of the petitioners

 madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri guuruuvaar (26 july) ko bhopal ke titi nagar thane main giraftaar dene pahunchenge
 In fact, Digvijay is angry at the Chief Minister of the state Shivraj Singh Chauhan calling him a traitor
 kuch dinon pehle ek press conference main shivaraj ne digvijay singh ke bare main kaha tha ki,'police kisi aatankwaadi ko maar de to digvijay aatankwaadi ke ghar jate hai
 They address him as 'G'
 kai baar digvijay singh ke ye kadam mujhe deshadrohi lagate hai
 Digvijay Singh objected to this statement of Shivraj and wrote a letter to him on 21 July
 khat main digvijay singh ne likhaa tha ki, 'mukhyamantri shivaraj singh mujhe 'deshadrohi' maanate hai
 As far as i know, i have not done any such work, due to which i fall in the category of 'traitor' in the eyes of the Chief Minister sitting on the constitutional post
 digvijay sinhane aage likhaa ki siem shivaraj singh chouhan ke paas mere deshadrohi hone ke jo bhi saboot hai unhen wo prashasan ko saunp den, taaki meri giraftaar ho sake or mujhapar cese darj karne main koi rukaawat naa aae
 With this, Digvijay Singh wrote in the letter that he would come to TT Nagar police station in Bhopal on July 26 and arrest him
 digvijay singh ne siem shivaraj ko chetavanee dete hue twit bhi kiya tha ki bina saboot mujh par itnaa bada aarope laga diya to unhen mujh se saarvajanik maafee maangani chahie, anyathaa mujhe mananeey adaalat kii sharan main janaa padegaa
 Kamal Nath will also be there, Digvijay Singh, who is going to arrest Satguruvar, will first reach the Madhya Pradesh Congress office and then walk on foot from the Congress office to the TT Nagar police station, where Digvijay Singh will arrest
 is dauraan digvijay singh ke saath pradesh congress adhyaksh kamalnath or vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh ajay singh bhi rahenge
 At the same time, the Congress has also asked a large number of workers to come on this march so that along with the arrest, a big power demonstration can also be done in the capital Bhopal
 jyotiraditya sindhiya kaa saath nahingiraftaar dene ja rahe digvijay singh ko kamalnath or ajay singh kaa saath bhale hi mil gaya ho lekin madhyapradesh congress chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke adhyaksh or saansadajyotiraditya sindhiyaaise paidal march or giraftaar kaarykram main shirkat nahin kar paaenge
 Though Scindia will come to Bhopal on Thursday itself, but according to his schedule so far, he will reach Bhopal at 5:30 pm on Thursday evening and will hold a meeting of the election campaign committee of Bhopal division at the state Congress headquarters at 6 pm the same evening
 iske baad sindhiya shaam saat baje hoshangabad ke liye ravaanaa ho jaaenge
 There is no mention of Scindia's arrest of Digvijay Singh and involvement in the foot march anywhere in the fixed schedule, which raises the question whether Scindia is deliberately keeping distance from this program? However, the Congress says that the Lok Sabha session is going on in Delhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia will come to Bhopal only after participating in the proceedings of Parliament
 saal 2018 main supreme court ne kai aitihaasik faisle to die, lekin kuch aise vivaad bhi hue jisane kaaphi kirakiri karai
 Among these, there are two incidents which happened for the first time in the history of Indian judiciary
 in ghatnaon ko kaala diwas tak kaha gaya
 At the beginning of the year, i
e
 on 12 January, four judges of the Supreme Court of India shocked the entire nation by holding a press conference together, for the first time an attempt was made to bring impeachment against a Chief Justice
 chaar jajon kii press conference ne chaunkaayasbase pehle baat karte hai chaar jajon kii press conference kii
 On 12 January, as soon as four judges appeared before the media, the whole country was stunned
 ye apni tarah kaa pehla mauka tha, jab jajon ko apni baat rakhane ke liye puure desh ke saamne aana padaa
 It was clear from what the judges said while raising the question of independence of the Supreme Court that everything is not well in the temple of justice
 jajon ne kaha ki supreme court main jo galat ho rahaa he, use bataanaa unki jimmedaari he
 Justice Kurian Joseph, Justice Chelameswar, Justice Lokur and Justice Ranjan Gogoi, while concerned about the independence of the Supreme Court, also appealed for an independent inquiry into the Judge Loya case
 in chaar jajon main justise chelmeshwar khaase naaraaz the
 Controversy over the hearing of Judge Loya's death: The hearing of the unnatural and mysterious death of Judge BH Loya was also witnessed in the Supreme Court judges
 is cese kii sunwaayee varisht jajon ko nazarandaaj kar junior jaj ko di gai thi
 The four judges also wrote in their letter that on several occasions the CJI decided the bench in its choice and irrationally while making the roster
 sijeai ke khilaaf mahabhiyogis saal supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke khilaaf mahabhiyog kaa bhi naatakeey ghatnakram hua
 However, the Congress has subsequently withdrawn the petition challenging the Rajya Sabha Chairman's motion to dismiss the motion for impeachment in the Supreme Court
 iske baad 5 jajon kii sanvaidhanik peeth ne ise khaarij kar diya
 It was the first time in the history of the judiciary that a notice was moved to bring an impeachment motion against the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
 master of roster par rageprail main supreme court ke andar chal rahaa manmutav phir sabake saamne aayaa
 Justice Chelameswar has refused to hear the petition filed by Shanti Bhushan on the issue of Master of Roster of Chief Justice of India
 unhone kaha ki vah nahin chaahate hai ki 24 ghante ke andar hi unka aadesh palat diya jaae
 It was clear from his point that the relationship between the CJI and the senior-most judges of the Supreme Court was not right
 justise keem joseph kii niyukti par takaravanyaaypalika kii kai masalon par centre sarkaar se bhi matbhed rahe hai
 This year the conflict became even more pronounced during the appointment of Justice KM Joseph of Uttarakhand to the Supreme Court
 darasal collegium kii ore se centre sarkaar ko justise joseph kaa naam bheja gaya tha, lekin centre ne varishthata ke ulanghan kaa hawala dete hue naam punarvichaar ke liye lautaa diya
 Significantly, in the case of imposition of President's rule in Uttarakhand, the Central Government was shocked by the decision of Justice Joseph's Bench
 centre saraakar ke virodh ko ghatnakram se bhi jod kar dekha gaya
 Someone was controlling the CJI! After his retirement in November, Justice Kurien once again questioned the delay in the appointment of judges, saying that the government had delayed introducing new rules
 unhone kaha tha ki mujhe samaj nahin aata ki sarkaar ye kyon kah rahi he ki memorondom of proscisger abhi bhi final nahin he
 The collegium is operating according to the draft mop
 lekin sarkaar phir bhi us par kadam nahin uthaa rahi
 He also questioned the then CJI Deepak Mishra, saying that i felt that someone was controlling him from outside
 srinagar ke meyar junayd aajim mattu (junaid Azim Mattu) ne kaha he ki bhale hi kashmir kii sadakon par laashen naa dikh rahi hon lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki sab saamaanya he
 To expect that everything would be normal there is very unrealistic
 bijepi (bjp)sarkaar kii hiraasat main lene kii niti puri tarah se oparational he
 After the Narendra Modi government abolished the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, the mayors of Srinagar and Jammu were granted equal status as "ministers of state" by a central order last month and divided it into two separate union territories
 meyar junayd aajim mattu jeckepisi ke pravaktaa bhi hai
 He also criticized the Centre's policy of arresting mainstream leaders in Kashmir
 saalon se, kashmir main raajnneetik kaaryakartaaon ne aatankwaadiyon dwaara di gai dhamkiyon or hinsa kaa saamana kiya lekin aaj ve aaj shikaar or shikari hai
 Please tell that JKPC chief Sajjad Lone is also one of the people taken into custody due to the Center's decision on Jammu and Kashmir
 mattu ne kaha, 'abhi bhi bahut se aise parivaar hai jo apane pyaare sadasyon se baat nahin kar paa rahe hai
 The Center's decision on Jammu and Kashmir has created an existential crisis
 ham hameshaa hinsa ke khatre ke saath rahete hai, yah koi nayaa paridrishy nahin he
 But justifying the withdrawal of fundamental rights is the basic basis of secession in Kashmir
 'bataa den ki videsh mantri es jaishankar ne jammu kashmir main pratibandh lagane kii jarurat ko sahi tehraaya tha
 He said last week, "such steps were necessary to stop the terrorists
 ham aisa kaise kar sakate hai ki aatankiyon or unke aakaaon ke bich communication ko roak saken or baaki logon ke liye internet khol den?'

 amit shah ne 29 may ko kendriya mantrimandal main janata dal (united) ke liye mahaj ek seat dene kaa prastaav diya, jise bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne khaarij kar diya tha
 Since then, a situation of conflict has arisen between the two JD (U) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the two power partners of Bihar
 16 loksabhaa or chah rajyasabha saansadon vaali party ke netaa ke rup main nitish ko kendriya mantrimandal main 'anupatik pratinidhitiv' kii apeksha thi, na ki pratikatmak
 Nitish expanded his cabinet on 2 June, two days after expressing his sentiment clearly
 modi sarkaar ke shapath grahan ke do din baad hue is vistaar main nitish ne jahaan apane dal ke aath logon ko mantrimandal main shaamil kiya vahiin bhaajapa ko sirf ek mantri pad kii peshkash kii
 Two days after the Bihar cabinet expansion, Union Minister Giriraj Singh lashed out at Nitish for attending an iftar
 giriraaj ne teen kaaryakramon kii jo chaar tasviren twit kii thim, nitish hi ekmaatr aise netaa the jo har tasviir main dikh rahe the
 Apparently, who was Giriraj's target
 baat yaheen rukii nahin
 On 9 June, JD (U) announced that it would contest the assembly elections of Jharkhand, Haryana, Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir alone
 bhaajapa, jharkhand or haryana main satta main he
 Obviously, JD (U) will not be a part of the BJP alliance anywhere except Bihar
 vaise jad (you) ke is faisle kaa rashtriya str par koi prabhaav nahin hoga kyonki in rajyon main uski upasthiti bas naam kii he
 Says a JD (U) leader, "JD (U) and BJP know that fighting our elections will not have much effect and neither they (bjp's) are going to cut votes
" '' yani ''sandesh pratikatmak zyada he
 BJP decided to give JD (U) just one place in the Union Cabinet, giving the same message to Nitish that he would not get any special sense in the government
 vahiin gathbandhan ko bihar tak simit karke nitish ne bhaajapa ko yah sandesh diya ki bihar unhen chalaane den
 Says a senior JD (U) leader, "nitish Kumar's sentiment has not hurt either
 doharepan ko dekhie
 The BJP made five ministers out of its 17 mps in Bihar, but offered only one ministerial post for the 16-member JD (U)
 ''ek or ahm baat yah ki jad (you) ne elaan kiya he ki use apane rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor ke vyavsaayik sanghathan indian political acshan cameti (ai-pack) ke jariye trinmul congress (tiemasi) ko chunaavon main paraamarsh sambandhi madad dene se koi etraj nahin he
 In his meeting with TMC chief Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on June 6, Kishore has given his consent to formulate an election strategy for her
 bhaajapa saal 2021 main pashchim bengal kii satta se trinmul ko bedakhal karke khud kabiz hone kaa lakshya lekar chal rahi he
 JD (U) believes that Nitish made a lot of compromises for the BJP during the Lok Sabha election campaign and hence he avoided issuing till the manifesto because Section 370, Uniform Civil Code and Special Ram Temple related to special status of Jammu and Kashmir His party's views on the issue were different from the bjp's
 jad (you) ke ek anya netaa kaa kahana he, ''nitish ne gathbandhan dharm nibhaane ke liye atirikt prayaas kiye
 The Prime Minister agreed to attend every meeting held in Bihar, campaign for Hinduist leaders like Giriraj Singh and contest elections on eight of the nine Lok Sabha seats where the BJP lost in 2014
 agar bhaajapa unki udaartaa ko uchit sammaan dena nahin jaanati to yah bhaajapa kii vifaltaa he
 Nitish says that he has options but he will remain with the NDA
 rajd netaa raghuvansh prasad singh ne unhen ghar vaapasi kii peshkash kii he, jabaki rabari devi ne ghoshnaa kii he ki rajya ke mahagathbandhan main jad(you) ke liye daravaaje khule hai
 If Nitish reunites with the RJD, which is still the largest party in the assembly, it may give him more leeway than the BJP which has been vocal in running for power, but it also creates a crisis of credibility
 It is possible
 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jad (you) bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan main bade bhai kii bhoomika main thi
 He left 102 seats for the BJP out of a total of 243 seats in the assembly and contested 141 seats himself
 2015 main, bhaajapa ne 157 siton par chunaav ladakar 53 jeetin, jabaki uske vipakshi mahagathbandhan ke hisse ke rup main jad (you) ne 101 siton par chunaav ladakar 71 siton par jeet hasil kii
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, both BJP and JD (U) contested 17 seats
 bhaajapa ne apni sabhi siten jeet leen
 JD (U) leaders do not deny that the BJP will demand equal seats in the 2020 assembly elections
 2005 ke baad, bihar main chaar vidhansabha or teen loksabhaa chunaav hue hai
 Except for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when Nitish was not with the BJP, the winner has been the one towards whom Nitish was
 unke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ke paas 243 sadasyeey bihar vidhansabha main 123 kaa saadhaaran bahumat he
 Tensions are rising between the BJP-JD (U), but Nitish cannot afford to sink the nda's lead so soon
 ek bhaajapa netaa kehete hai, ''agle varsh vidhansabha chunaav honge
 In such a situation, it is unlikely that JD (U) will try to form an alternative coalition again in the current assembly
 ''*** The government had recently hinted that it might take the path of enacting a law on it, amid demands by the BJP for a review of the alleged mis-addition and deletion in the NRC, but now Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has cleared Said that the people of the state need not panic on the NRC issue
 unhone kaha ki 31 agast ko prakashit hone ja rahi antim NRC main jinke naam nahin hai, unhen ghabaraane kii koi zarurat nahin he

 antim NRC ke prakaashan ke baad bhi sabhi samudaayon ke bich ekta, bhaichara or shanti isi tarah bani rahegi
 
 
 "earlier this week, Sarbananda Sonowal had come to Delhi to discuss the NRC issue with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and indicated that bjp-led governments at the Center and the state were considering options for re-verification of the final NRC
 , Because earlier the government claimed that incorrect names were added to it and removed
 ab mukhyamantri ke is bayaan ko ahm mana ja rahaa he, kyonki supreme court ne ri-veriphication yojana ke aagrah ko khaarij karte hue antim NRC kaa prakaashan 31 agast tak karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 The Chief Economic Advisor said - companies need to change the mindset of 'save Papa', don't cry in front of the government
 In an important development, the Ministry of Home Affairs also decided to increase the deadline to allow people removed from NRC to appeal against it
 
 maujuuda samay main yah dedline 60 din kii he, jise 120 din tak badha diya gaya he
 Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said, "if someone's name is removed, there is no need to panic
" 
 
 unki shikayaton ko sunne ke liye panchat ke zariye vyavastha maujuud he, or grih mantralay ne bhi apil ke liye 120 din kii mohalat de di he
 
 
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has already clarified the steps and procedures to be taken in the event of the name being removed from the final NRC

 " Dirty Picture Fame director Milan Luthria is known for his stories' freshness and cinematic art in Bollywood
 kahaniyon kaa unka treetment bhi darshakon ke saath-saath critiks ko chaunkaata he
 After the release of 'once Upon a Time Not Mumbai Dobara', he shared some experiences related to the film
 prastut he unase hui baatcheet ke pramukh ansh-aajkal bollywood main sikval kaa chalan kaaphi bad gaya he
 Is this not an attempt to pull off an unnecessary story? There is no scope for a sequel in every film's story
 'vans apon e time in mumbai' aise shot ke saath khatm hui thi, jahaan film khatm hone ke baad bhi kahani khatm nahin hoti
 Leaves many questions behind him
 pehle se soch rakhaa tha ki vans apon e time in mumbai kaa sikval banaaenge?bilkul nahin
 i did not make a sequel to any of my films
 jab pehla part bana rahaa tha, tab bhi nahin sochaa tha
 After that Dirty got busy making pictures
 sikval kaa idia darty pikchar ke dauraan hi aayaa
 The first film was well liked by the audience
 ek friend ne baton-baton main sikval kaa idia de daalaa
 Thought a lot on it
 idia mujhe bhi interesting laga
 After the Dirty Picture was over, work on the script and casting of the film started
 pehla part banane ke baad aapane kaha tha ki randeep huda is film kii discoveri hai
 Ajay Devgan and Kangana Ranaut were also highly praised
 lekin sikval main puraane logon ko jagah nahin mili
 Why? The theme, location, and script of the new story were demanding completely new faces
 charitra vahi the, lekin vakt, jagah or sandarbh badal gaye the
 However, during the making of the film, Ajay missed it because our chemistry is very amazing
 lekin har nae kaam ke saath nae anubhav or nai chunautiyaan judi hoti hai
 Newness is always amazing
 pehle se tay raaston par chalane main koi chalange nahin
 In the sequel, the underworld has risen from Mumbai to Dubai? Yes
 lekin sirf dubai tak simit nahin he
 There is a connection of the underworld to the streets of Mumbai and Bollywood
 haalanki film hit rahi he, lekin sikval ko pehali film kii tarah darshakon rispance nahin mila?aisa nahin he
 The second part has also earned well
 film ko achche rivyuu mili hai or darshakon ko bhi film pasand ai he
 The two films cannot be compared
 donon apane aap main indivijuel creative anubhav hai
 This is your first film with Akshar Kumar
 unke saath kaam kaa anubhav kaisaa rahaa?shandaar
 Akshay has amazing discipline
 har baat ko baariki se sunanaa or samajhnaa unki khaasiyat he
 On the one hand they are very serious about work, on the other hand they are not left behind in laughing and joking
 sirf main hi kyon, puure kru ko unke saath kaam karne main bahut majaa aayaa
 Your pair with Ekta Kapoor has solidified
 unke saath yah teesri film banaai he aapane
 Ekta is very professional and she is very keen on business
 vah is baat kaa anumaan laga leti hai ki koun si kahani darshakon ko pasand aegi
 But at the same time, they do not interfere very much in creative matters
 vah diarector ko puri aazaadee ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka detii hai
 Sometimes there is wrangling, but there is also fun in it
 kya aap aaj bhi apane guru mahesh bhatta ke saath apni sabhi filmon kaa first de, first sho dekhte hai?haa
 So far, our record remains
 mahesh bhatta kitna bhi vyast hon, saath film dekhne ke liye vakt nikaal hi lete hai
 But do not make films like my mentor Mahesh Bhatt? i do not make films of any kind
 main apni tarah kii filmein banaata hum
 Every film from the raw thread to Once Upon a Time in Mumbai again is different
 ab film relies ho gai he to free hokar kya kar rahe hai?free to main kabhi nahin hota
 i play golf on a leisure or sitting with friends
 lekin tab bhi dimag main filmein hi chalati rahati hai
 What is the upcoming film? This question is not too soon
 thodaa intjaar kariye

 Paying the highest price of petrol and diesel in the last four years, people are looking for the savings that came to the government during the good days of cheap oil
 achche dinon ke jitne munh utane matlab hai, alabatta un dinon kii is pahchaan par koi tanta shaayad nahin hoga ki kachche tel kii keemton main lambii va sthaayee giravat kii krupa se kareeb ek dashak ke baad puure chaar saal (2014 se 2018) tak bharat main petrol-dijal kii keemten lalachaane vaale str tak kam thim
 In this greed, the government increased the excise duty by pressing on the petro family
 kitni bachat yaa kamai hui thi sarkaar ko? kahaan gai vah? kya tel kii badhati keemton se sarkaar hamen bachaa paaegi?aaie, aankade finchate hai-vah 2014 kii duusari chamahi thi jab tel kii ghatati keemton kaa tyohaar (july 2008-132 dollar; june 2017-46 dollar prati bairal) shuru hua jo 2017-18 kii aakhri timahi tak chalaa
 At the same time, the government handed over the prices of petrochemicals to the market and companies started changing the prices daily according to crude oil and other costs
 -kaccha tel sasta hua lekin petrol-dijal nahin kyonki 2017 tak sarkaar ne petrol par 21
 5 Rs
 or dijal par 17
 3 Rs
 prati litre kii exatij duty laga di thi
 - Petro excise duty collection in 2017 as a proportion of GDP due to this increased tax
 6 fisadi yani (prati 100 ru
 1 on GDP
 6 ru
 Of petrochemical duty) which reached 0 in 2014
 7 fisadi thi
 It was a record tax collection on oil in previous decades
 -is kamai kaa istemaal hua, ek-14wein vitt ayog kii sifarish ke mutabik rajyon ko zyada sansaadhan aavanton or do-sarkari karmchaariyon ko saatven vetan ayog ke bhugtan ke liye
 -good days with cheap crude oil resulted in two more benefits
 thok (5
 2 to 1 8%) or khudara ( 9
 4 to 4 5%) mahangaai ghat gai
 At the same time, due to cheap imports, there was relief on the foreign front
 videshi aay-vyay kaa antar bataane vaala curent account dephisit kam ho gaya
 This was the earning and spending of good days
 
 
 ab baari he mahange tel ke saath aage kii chadhaai kii
 0 per ten dollar in the current price of crude oil ($ 74-75 per barrel)
 50 fisadi kii badhotaree hogi kyonki petro utpaada mahange honge
 - 0 in current account deficit at every dollar of ten dollars per barrel
 60 fisadi kii badhat or rupye main kamajori
 Now, if inflation has to be stopped, the government will have to reduce the excise duty i
e
 two rupees
 prati litre kii exise duty kami se 280 arab ru
 Loss of revenue and huge increase in kerosene and LPG subsidy separately
 chunavi chunauti se bharpoor mahange dinon ke liye vitt mantri arun jetali or pradhanmantri narendra modi ko ab rajyon kii madad chahie
 - States will have to reduce VAT to curb oil inflation
 jo phayda unhen mila tha vah lautaanaa hoga
 But this is impossible because the financial condition of the states has deteriorated despite full help from the Center
 -petrol-dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laane kii ukvamid ab khatm ho gai he
 Prices are rising and revenue declines are not expected to stop
 pichley chaar saal main sarkaar ne saste tel par baari tex thopa lekin is kamai ko sanjone kaa sooyeeboojh bharaa tarika nahin nikaala
 When the world was enjoying cheap crude oil, we were buying expensive fuel in the hope that the tax imposed by the government would solve the problems ahead
 lekin rajkoshiya aankadon ko kanghee karne se yah najar aata he ki chaar saal ke dauraan vitt mantri kaa sara bajtiy kaushal, darasal, saste kachche tel or baari tex par tikaa tha
 Everything has started changing with the passing of cheap oil days
 tel phir khul rahaa he
 In this, consumers will get scorched and oil companies too
 sarkarein chunaav dekhakar tel kii keemton kii raajnneeti karengi
 The same was happening before 2014

 But amidst all this, the name of Sunanda Pushkar, wife of MP Shashi Tharoor, has also started trending on Twitter
 darasal apni raay rakhane main hameshaa aage rahane vaale shashi tharur ne memon kii faansee par bhi twit karte hue kaha 'is baat se dukhi hum ki hamaari sarkaar ne ek insaan ko faansee par lataka diya

Not just Tharoor, Digvijay Singh's tweets are also targeted by BJP leaders
 digvijay singh ne apane twit main shankaa jataai he 'sarkaar aatankwaad ke anya maamalon ke niptaare main bhi kya itani hi patibaddhta dikhaaegi? nyaaypalika or sarkaar kii saakh daanv par lagi he

 Actually, Shashi Tharoor, who was always ahead in giving his opinion, also tweeted on Memon's hanging saying, 'I am saddened that our government hanged a person
 rajya pryojit hatyaein hamen hatyaron ke samakaksh laakar khadaa kar detii hai
 Tharoor's series of comments on the Yakub case prompted some people to take to Twitter to express Sunanda Pushkar's name
 ise bhi padhie : yaqub kii faansee par kisne kya kaha? Taking a dig at Tharoor, it was written in the tweets that it shows the double-minded mentality of the Congress MP, is he even a little sorry for the death of Sunanda Pushkar? At the same time, a tweet has written that Shashi Tharoor believes that the innocent have been punished, is it time to open the Sunanda Pushkar case? yahi nahin tharur kii tippanee par bhaajapa netaa aar pi rudi ne agency se baatcheet main kaha ki vah tharur ke is twit se stabdh hai or agar unhen is baat se itani hi dikkat thi to pehle hastkshep kyon nahin kiya? sirf tharur hi nahin digvijay singh ke twits bhi bhaajapa netaaon ke nishane par hai
 Digvijay Singh has expressed doubt in his tweet, 'will the government show the same commitment in dealing with other cases of terrorism? The credibility of the judiciary and government is at stake
 ' On this, Jaishankar Prasad has raised the question whether this comment of Digvijay Singh should be considered as the official opinion of the Congress? Meanwhile, the president of majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen party Asaduddin Owaisi has questioned whether the accused of Kodnani, Bajrangi and Sikh riots will also be punished? On the other hand, senior advocate Prashant Bhushan has called the hanging of Yakub a failure of justice

 We will be able to believe that only two-and-three hundred years ago, Bundelkhand was a farming paradise in India! Bundelkhand also contributed to the luster of India's first global brand, cotton cloth, at the end of the 18th century, where being a farmer is the biggest misfortune today
 kaash! hamaare paas bharat ke sabhi paryaavarniya parivartanon or usase ai garibi kaa tathyagat itihaas hota lekin bundelkhand hamaare sabase kareeb kii vibheeshikaa he jiskaa itihaas uplabdh he
 The black soil of Bundelkhand used to absorb so much moisture that there was no need of irrigation in winter (rabi)
 kuen nahin the
 In the middle of the eighteenth century, when the economic power of the upper ganges-yamuna Doab was losing, the stories of the splendor of Bundelkhand were on the tongue of the travelers

 The debate on water and drought may not be as exciting as politics, but now we have to face two smoldering truths: One: Monsoon is ineffective, we are surrounded by terrible water crisis
 Two new 'bundelkhand' are emerging in different parts of the country
 sanad rahe ki pichley pandrah saal main nirantar sookhe ke baad bundelkhand main ab sirf tabah kheti or kisaanon kii khudakushi bachi he
 According to gandhinagar-iit's Drought Forecasting Center, 42 per cent of the country and 40 per cent of the population is vulnerable to drought
 91 pramukh jalaashyon main maharashtra, gujarat or dakshin bharat ke 58 jalaashyon main pani das saal ke nunatam str tak ghat gaya he
 Significantly, there has been no drought for the last ten years
 monsoon (bakaul mausam vibhaag) saamaanya rahaa he lekin iske baavjood aadha bharat sookhe se karaah rahaa he
 When will our policy regulators understand that the water problem has gone beyond the extent of monsoon
 asankhya saamaanya monsoon ke baavjood
 
 
 Since 1997, the area of drought-hit areas in India has increased by 57%
 sookhaa kai saal main ek baar nahin balki niyamit aata he
 According to the Ministry of Geology, between 1977 and 2012, multi-year droughts in India (persistent moisture loss for three to five years) have steadily increased
 isse pehle ke dashakon main aisa kam dekha gaya tha
 About 100 big districts (including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra, Punjab, Haryana), 100 districts of the states have faced drought repeatedly in the last 15 years

 Nevertheless, the new Ministry of Water Power has emerged

 This is called virtual water trade

 In the next 2000 years, the changing climate of the tigris-euphrates river, the Mesopotamia that emerged from the world's first civilization, organized agriculture and city (uruk) in 7000 BC, limited it to farming

 Not surprisingly, the world is now trying to understand the impact of water scarcity with other results

 Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is being blamed for the 'pastoral woman' remarks, is upset about the case
 jaankaree ke anusaar unhone pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko ek sandesh bhejkar kaha he ki unhone unke liye kabhi bhi aisi bhashaa kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 According to senior Pakistani officials in New York, as soon as Nawaz Sharif came to know that a dispute had arisen over the alleged remarks, he directed his close aides to contact the Indian authorities at the earliest
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki sharif ne apane videsh sachiv jaleel abbaas jilani ko yah jimmedaari saunpi ki ve manmohan singh ko vaastavik sthiti ke bare main sandesh den ki unhone unke liye kabhi bhi aisi bhashaa kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 Jilani contacted National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon in the morning and explained the situation in Pakistan
 sutron ke anusaar, menon ne jilani se kaha ki unhone aise bayaan kii pramanikta kii pushti kar lee he or unhen vaastaviktaa kii jaankaree he
 It is believed that he told Menon that the Prime Minister has also been informed about this
 yah pakistani pratinidhimandal or pakistani pradhanmantri sharif ke liye badi raahat ke rup main saamne aayaa
 Earlier, a Pakistani journalist present at a morning breakfast hosted by Nawaz Sharif denied that Sharif had used a word like 'country woman' for Manmohan Singh
 haalanki unhone kaha ki sharif isse khush nahin the ki manmohan singh ne jab america raashtrapati baraak obama se washington main mulaakaat kii, to unhone pakistan ke bare main ‘shikaayat’ kii
 Pakistan's Aaj TV journalist Absar Alam said, 'he never said such a word

 He said, 'this story is about the way that everybody sleeps in a hall after an event

 afjal khan kaa daawa he ki jis aam chunaav main sharif ko jabardast jeet mili, usamen dhaandhlee hui thi
 Addressing his supporters outside Parliament, Qadri said, "I call upon the members of the National Assembly to leave the house before my deferment is over

 Qadri held the ruling PML-N responsible for the deterioration of the situation

 It is to be noted that to get the benefit of the scheme, the farmers were entitled to less than 2 hectares of land

 kyonki enelue raipur jinke naam par he justise hidayatullah bhi bharat ke 11wein mukhya nyaayadhish the
 Therefore, it is important to seriously investigate the complaint of the students and take a decisive decision on it
 suniye hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity of lau kii chatraayen kya kah rahi hai
 In a law university, a student should say that she was told in a class that you look very beautiful, come forward and sit so that the mind of the teacher and the students are also seen
 ek lau uniwarsity kii chaatra se yah kaha jaae ki college ke kaarykram main tumne dance acha kiya he, ab kamare main dance karke dikhaao
 This is such a serious matter that it must be investigated
 hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity of lau kii chaatraon ke bich 180 panne kii copy ghumaai gai
 He was asked to record his experience in this copy, and 177 pages were filled by looking
 har panne par sexual hairaasament kii koi na koi ghatana darj he
 Not only this, a form was prepared on Google and even when alumni were asked, there were 78 pages of complaints, which mention incidents of sexual harassment and commentary
 in chaatraon main se kal koi vakil banegi, jaj banegi, kya pataa chif justise of india banegi, aisi chaatraon ke college jivan kaa ye anubhav hoga
 There should be more action than shame on this
 uniwarsity ke register kaa kahana he ki unke paas yon utpeedan kii koi aupchaarik shikaayat abhi tak nahin ai he
 In the early days, these complaints were not formalized due to fear, ie written complaints were less accumulated but these agitating students say that many complaints have been made but no action has been taken
 isiilie is campus main hamen chahie azaadi kaa naaraa lag rahaa he
 The Chief Justice of India should get a 180-page copy and take serious action on the complaints of law university students
 is campus main pinjadaa tod andolan bhi chalaa he
 Meaning the students are asking for freedom to study in the library till late night and go out of the hostel after 10:30
 kuch chaatro ne bataaya ki ek minute bhi der ho jaati he, saadhe das kii jagah 10 baj kar 31 minute ho jaataa he to sidhaa phone ghar chalaa jaataa he
 Different things start to be told there again
 kapadon kaa byora bhi diya jane lagata he ki kalege main kya pahenti he kya nahin
 Even a phone call was made to a student that she drinks alcohol, drugs, smokes cigarettes
 jiskaa koi tuk nahin tha
 a student has also alleged to have checked the form in non-attendance
 hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity of lau ke chaatro ne jokhim liya he
 From the sexual harrassment to the closing of the library from ten to half past ten, it has broken the tradition of remaining silent on all kinds of disturbances
 unhen pataa he ki agar jeet nahin mili, logon kaa saath nahin mila to phir se unheen ke saamne khadey honge jinase sexual hairaasament kii shikaayatein hai
 This is not the case
 is lau uniwarsity main 65 saal se zyaada umr tak vaais chancelar nahin rah saktaa
 The Vice Chancellor raised the age limit in the Working Committee to 70 years
 usee uniwarsity ke ek shikshak ne jab hai court main chunauti di to vaais chancelar cese haar gaye
 His appointment was canceled because he is over 65 years old
 isi ke baad se chaatr andolan par utar aae kyonki vaais chancelar apni kursii bachaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The movement is gaining momentum
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen faisla chahie
 They will not back down from assurance
 ravi shankar sharma ko antarim taur par kulapati niyukt kiya gaya he
 He addressed the students and also heard the problems
 guzarish kii ki chaatr jaldi class room main laut aae
 The interim Vice Chancellor has assured the girl students that action will be taken against the teachers
 magar chaatro kaa kahana he ki unki sabhi maangen nahin maani ja rahi hai isliye ve apane andolan ko khatm nahin karenge
 Their demand is also that the warden of the hostel should not be a teacher, otherwise they bring out the anger of the hostel in the class room
 class main dekh lene kii dhamkee dete hai
 In the prime time of July 9, we had told that studies at Manipur University have been stalled for 40 days and in support of the students there, the chairman of about 28 departments has resigned from his post
 alag-alag academik skulon ke 5 dean ne bhi istapha de diya he
 Even after our news of that day, there was another 45 days of agitation
 yani 85 dinon tak andolan chalaa jo 30 may se shuru hua tha
 Then came the news that the HR Ministry has sent its VC AP Pandey on leave
 ab api pandey chuttee se laut aae hai or aate hi faisla kiya he ki yahaan shikshak sangh band, karmchaaree sangh band or chaatr sangh band
 Bain bain bain, dhain dhain dhain
 
 
 ek hi baar main sara bartan idhar se udhar
 In the notification on Saturday, Pandey said that he has joined his duty
 
 
 1 sitambar ke aadesh main pandey ne kaha he ki manipur uniwarsity act 2005 main MUTA or MUSA jaisi karmchaariyon kii sansthaaon kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 
 
 It was said in the order that both these institutions are involved in disruptive activities in the university, which will create the current situation in the university
 
 
 aadesh se uniwarsity campus main in sansthaaon kii gatividhiyon par pabandi laga di gai he or kaha gaya he ki agar koi in gatividhiyon main shaamil hoga to uske kilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai kii jaaegi
 
 
 Vice Chancellor Pandey has also told the Indian Express that he has done so because teachers and staff unions were inciting students to protest and worsen the university atmosphere
 
 
 wo chaatro ko todphod kii ore dhakel rahe the jisase kai chaatro kaa bhavishya karaab ho rahaa tha
 
 
 Students and teachers have opposed this order and termed it as virtual
 
 
 MUTA kii ek apaat baithak main prastaav paas kiya gaya ki pandey ko tab tak uniwarsity campus main nahin ghusane diya jayega jab tak unke kilaaf jaanch or uske baad kii karrwai puri nahin ho jaati
 
 
 The proposal states that Pandey's virtual order shows how undemocratic and dictator he is
 
 
 MUSU, MUTA or MUSA kii ek saajha baithak main paas ek anya prastaav main kaha gaya he ki sarkaar 4 sitambar se pehle pandey ke adeshon par uchit karrwai kare
 
 
 He said that Pandey's orders during the holiday should be criticized and declared null and void so that they would not be binding on anyone
 
 
 MUTA ke pravaktaa profesar enen singh ne indian express ko bataaya ki agar 4 sitambar kii shaam tak hamaari maangon par koi jawaab nahin aata to ham apni hadtaal phir shuru kar denge
 
 
 If someone opens the factory to stop the noise, then his business will go on in India
 tarah-tarah ke bahaane apanaae ja rahe hai magar awaz uthaane kii suvidha na hoti to hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity of lau kii chaatraon kii kahani aap tak kaise pahunchati
 The youth cleaning the car in the rain on the streets of Hazratganj, Lucknow, are doing this so that the government will pay attention to them and their demands are heard
 inaki maang yah he ki uttar pradesh main sab ispector ke 26000 se adhik hazaron pad khaali hai
 He has submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister that sub-inspector has not been recruited since 2011
 ab jab 6500 log paas hue hai to sabhi ko rakhaa ja saktaa he kyonki dhai saal kii prakriya ke baad ye paas hue hai
 If the government resumes 3308 posts, then more than 3000 students will be deprived of the job even after passing and they will not have age for the next recruitment
 isliye ye kabhi car saaf kar rahe hai to kabhi dharna de rahe hai taaki sarkaar unki sune
 On Sunday, these people also staged a sit-in but nothing happened
 bhartiya rail ne haal hi main pariksha shuru hone se kuch din pehle siton kii sankhya badha di thi lekin riselt hone ke baad kya siton kii sankhya badhaai ja sakati he, is par faisla sarkaar ko hi lenaa hoga
 Sub Inspector reinstatement came out in 2015, which was canceled
 phir 2016 main ai 3308 padon kii
 Its result has come, but the recruitment process is still going on
 2016 se lekar 2018 aa gaya
 The exam was conducted twice or even due to paper leak
 chaatr yah bhi puch rahe hai ki daaroga kii nai bharti pariksha kyon nahin aa rahi he
 Eight months ago, there was a news that it would come soon but it has not come yet
 2017 ke saal main taminladu kii ek pratibhashali ladki es anita ne aatmahatya kar lee thi
 She wanted to become a doctor but could not pass the medical examination NEET
 anita kii aatmahatya ke baad tamilnadu main neet ko lekar kaaphi pradarshan bhi hue the
 Anita was one of the toppers at the state level in Tamil Nadu
 vahaan rajya str par merit banataa tha or usee ke hisaab se medical kalege mil jaataa tha
 The arrival of NEET made it difficult for poor students as the exam pattern changed
 tamilnadu str par 12 veen main anita 1200 main se 1176 laai thi
 Had brought 100 out of 100 in physics, yet could not become a doctor due to NEET and Anita committed suicide
 tippaniyan a year after Anita's death, a library is built in her memory
 45 lakh kii laagat se yah librari bani he
 After Anita's death, several political parties and organizations gave money to her family, which her parents used to build a library in memory of Anita
 isamen 2500 kitaaben hai
 Anita's parents used to work as laborers
 chaahate to beti kii yaad main mili paise se apana jivan behatar kar sakate the magar tin shanmugam or maa es anantham unhone ek librari banaai taaki baakiyon ke bacchon kaa jivan behatar ho sake
 Anita's statue is also installed here and her portraits were also installed
 neet kii vyavastha aane se pehle number ke aadhaar par tamilnadu ke gaanvon ke bachche bhi doctor ban jate the magar jab se neet aayaa he anita jaisi chaatraon ke liye mushkil ho gaya he
 The rupee fell today against the dollar
 ek dollar kii keemat 71 rupee 21 paise ho gai
 The rupee had never fallen so much
 16 agast se lekar 3 sitambar tak petrol kii keemton main kareeb 2 rupaya kii badhottaree ho chuki he
 Petrol is getting 86-87 rupees per liter in many cities
 pehle hi bataa den ki enelue raipur main admician itnaa aasaan nahin he
 These students got admission here after being selected in clat's All India Competition
 inkaa kahana he ki ham vakil banakar duusare ke adhikaron ke liye khak ladenge jab apane hi adhikaron ke liye bol na sake
 These youngsters are being raised like torches of mobiles, not from the whatsapp University where fake messages are accepted by people for the whole day, but they are the real universities who demand that the library be closed at 10:30 pm It makes sense librari to 24 ghante khuli rahani chahie
 Do you understand as an audience that their class ends at three in the afternoon
 uske baad kha pikar thodaa aaraam kar 5 baje bhi librari pahunchenge to padhane ke liye kitna kam samay milegaa
 The library here is good, so students should get a chance to use it fully
 inkaa kahana he ki baaki neshnal uniwarsity of lau kii librari 10 baje raat se lekar 3 baje subah tak khuli rahati hai, isliye hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity of lau kii librari bhi raat bhar khuli rahe
 If the library of National University of Law Nalsar remains open till 4 pm, then according to the library of Raipur 10
 30 baje band ho jaati he
 The library should be open overnight, day and night, those who sell the dream of making you like India abroad, the library is open 24 hours in those universities abroad
 par in chaatro kii ladaai sirf librari ke samay ko lekar nahin he
 There are some issues which, on hearing on the phone, are not sure that the teachers of the law college can dare to do so
 bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko turant ise notice main lenaa chahie
 Because NLU Raipur named after Justice Hidayatullah was also the 11th Chief Justice of India
 isliye zaruri he ki chaatraon kii shikaayat par gambhirtha se jaanch ho or is par nirnaayak faisla ho
 Listen to what the students of Hidayatullah National University of Law are saying
 ek lau uniwarsity main koi chaatra yah kahe ki use bhari class main yah kaha gaya ki tum bahut sundar dikhti ho, aage aakar baitho taaki padhaane vaale kaa man lage or padhane waalon kaa bhi
 It should be said to a law university student that you have done good dance in the college program, now show it by dancing in the room
 yah itnaa syrius maamla he ki isaki jaanch honi hi chahie
 a 180-page copy was rotated among the students of Hidayatullah National University of Law
 unase kaha gaya ki ve apana anubhav is copy main darj karaaen to 177 panna dekhte-dekhte bhar gaya
 Every page has one or the other incident of sexual harassment
 yahi nahin google par ek form taiyaar kiya gaya or purv chaatro se bhi poocha gaya to vahaan bhi 78 pej shikaayatein ho gayi, jinamein sexual hairaasament or comentbazi kii ghatnaon kaa zikr he
 Tomorrow, one of these girl students will become a lawyer, a judge will be formed, what address will be the Chief Justice of India, such students will have this experience of college life
 is par shame aane se zyaada karrwai honi chahie
 The university registrar says that he has not yet received any formal sexual harassment complaint
 shuru ke dinon main dar ke kaaran in shikayaton ko aupchaarik rup nahin diya gaya, yani likhit shikaayatein kam jamaa huin magar andolan kar rahe in chaatr chaatraon kaa kahana he ki kaaphi shikaayatein kii gayi hai magar karrwai nahin hui he
 That is why in this campus, we want the slogan of independence
 bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko 180 pej kii kapi mangava leni chahie or lau uniwarsity ke chaatro kii shikayaton par gambhir ection lenaa chahie
 There is also a cage break movement in this campus
 matlab chatraayen der raat tak librari main padhane or saadhe das baje ke baad hastal se baahar jane kii azaadi maang rahi hai
 Some students said that it is too late for one minute, instead of ten and a half, it becomes ten to 31 minutes, then the direct phone goes home
 vahaan phir tarah tarah kii baaten bataai jane lagati hai
 Clothes are also given details of what wears in the college or not
 yahaan tak ki ek chaatra ke ghar phone gaya ki vah sharaab piti he, drugs leti he, cigarette piti he
 Which did not make any sense
 ek chaatra ne gaiyr haaziri main rup check karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 Students at Hidayatullah National University of Law have taken a risk
 sexual hairaasament se lekar saadhe das baje tak librari band ho jane se lekar tamaam tarah kii gadabadiyon par chup rah jane kii parampara ko tod diya he
 They know that if they do not win, if they do not get the support of the people, then they will again stand in front of those who have complaints about sexual harassment
 maamla yahi nahin he
 The Law University cannot remain Vice Chancellor for more than 65 years of age
 vaais chancelar ne kaarysmiti main umr seemaa badhaakar 70 saal kar lee
 The Vice Chancellor lost the case when a teacher from the same university challenged it in the High Court
 unki niyukti radd ho gai kyonki ve 65 saal se zyaada ke ho chuke hai
 Since then, the students have come on the movement because the Vice Chancellor is trying to save his chair
 andolan teji pakadta ja rahaa he
 Students say they need a decision
 ve aashwaasan se peeche nahin hatenge
 Ravi Shankar Sharma has been tentatively appointed as the vice-chancellor
 unhone chaatro ko sambodhit kiya or samasyaayein bhi sunin
 Requested that the students return to the class room early
 antarim kulapati ne chaatraon ko aashwaasan diya he ki shikshakon ke khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 But the students say that all their demands are not being accepted, so they will not end their agitation
 inaki maang yah bhi he hastal kaa warden teacher na ho varna hastal kaa gussa ve class room main nikaalte hai
 Threatens to be seen in class
 9 july ke prime time main hamane bataaya tha ki manipur uniwarsity main 40 dinon se padhai thapp he or vahaan ke chaatro ke samarthan main kareeb 28 vibhaagon ke adhyaksh ne apane pad se istipha de diya he
 5 deans of different academic schools have also recommended
 hamaari us din kii khabar ke baad bhi 45 din or andolan chalaa tha
 That is, the movement lasted for 85 days which started from May 30
 phir khabar ai ki maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne vahaan ke visi api pandey ko chuttee par bhej diya he
 Now AP Pandey has returned from leave and has decided that teachers union closed, employees union closed and student union closed
 bain bain bain, dhain dhain dhain
 
 
 All the dishes from here to there in one go
 shanivaar ko aae notification main pandey ne kaha ki unhone apni duty join kar lee he
 
 
 In the September 1 order, Pandey has stated that the Manipur University Act 2005 does not have any provision for employees' organizations like MUTA and MUSA
 
 
 aadesh main kaha gaya ki ye donon hi sansthaaen uniwarsity main vighatnkaaree gatividhiyon main lipt hai jisase uniwarsity main maujuuda halaat bane
 
 
 The order has banned the activities of these institutions in the university campus and it has been said that disciplinary action will be taken against anyone if they are involved in these activities
 
 
 vaais chancelar pandey ne indian express ko bhi bataaya he ki unhone aisa kiya he kyonki shikshak or karmchaaree sangh chaatro ko virodh or uniwarsity kaa maahaul karaab karne ke liye uksaa rahe the
 
 
 He was pushing the students towards sabotage which was spoiling the future of many students
 
 
 chaatro or shikshakon ne is aadesh kaa virodh karte hue use virtual yani abhaasi bataaya he
 
 
 In an emergency meeting of the MUTA, the resolution was passed that Pandey would not be allowed to enter the university campus until the investigation and subsequent action against him was completed
 
 
 prastaav main kaha gaya he ki pandey kaa virtual order bataata he ki wo kitna aloktantric or taanashaah hai
 
 
 Another resolution passed at a joint meeting of MUSU, MUTA and MUSA states that the government should take appropriate action on Pandey's orders before 4 September
 
 
 unhone kaha ki chuttee ke dauraan die gaye pandey ke adeshon kii aalochana kii jaae or unhen null and void ghoshit kiya jaae taaki wo kisi par badhyakaari naa rahen
 
 
 MUTA spokesperson Professor NN Singh told The Indian Express that if there is no response to our demands by the evening of September 4, we will resume our strike
 
 
 awaz band karne kii factory koi khol le to uskaa dhandha bharat main khub chal padegaa
 Various excuses are being adopted, but if there is no facility to raise voice, how would the story of Hidayatullah National University of Law students reach you
 lakhanu ke hazaratganj kii sadakon par barish main car kii safai karte noujvaan isliye aisa kar rahe hai taaki sarkaar kaa in par dhyaan jaae or unki maang suni jaae
 Their demand is that there are more than 26000 vacancies of sub-inspectors in Uttar Pradesh
 inhone mukhyamantri ko gyaapan diya he ki sab inspector kii 2011 ke baad se bhartee nahin hui he
 Now that 6500 people have passed, all can be kept because they have passed after two and a half years of process
 agar sarkaar 3308 padon par hi bahaali karegi to baaki 3000 se adhik chaatr paas hokar bhi naukari se vanchit ho jaaenge or agali bharti ke liye unke paas umr nahin bachegi
 That is why they are cleaning the car sometimes, they are giving picketing sometimes so that the government will listen to them
 ravivaar ko in logon ne dharna bhi diya magar hua kuch nahin
 Indian Railways had recently increased the number of seats a few days before the commencement of the examination, but after the result, the government will have to take a decision on whether the number of seats can be increased
 2015 main sab inspector kii bahaali nikali jo radd ho gai
 Then in 2016 i 3308 posts
 iskaa riselt aa gaya he magar bharti kii prakriya abhi tak chal hi rahi he
 2016 to 2018 arrived
 do-do baar pariksha hui or paper li hone ke kaaran radd bhi hui
 Students are also asking why the new recruitment examination of the inspector is not coming
 aath maheene pehle khabar chhapi thi ki jaldi aegi magar abhi tak nahin ai he
 In the year of 2017, s Anita, a talented girl from Tamil Nadu committed suicide
 ve doctor bananaa chaahati thim lekin medical pariksha neet paas nahin kar sakin
 After Anita's suicide, there were many protests in Tamil Nadu about Neet
 taminalnadu main rajya str par anita topper main se ek thi
 There was merit at the state level and according to that, medical colleges were available
 neet aane se garib chaatro ke liye mushkil ho gaya kyonki pariksha kaa pattern badal gaya tha
 Anita had brought 1176 out of 1200 in 12th level at Tamil Nadu level
 physics main 100 main 100 number laai thi phir bhi neet ke kaaran doctor nahin ban saki or anita ne aatmahatya kar lee
 The comments anita kii maut ke ek saal baad uski yaad main ek librari banaai gai he
 This library has been built at a cost of 45 lakhs
 anita kii maut ke baad kai raajnneetik dalon or sanghathanon ne uske parivaar ko paise die the, jiskaa istamaal kar uske mata pita ne anita kii yaad main ek librari hi bana di
 It has 2500 books
 anita ke maa-baap mazaduri karte the
 If he wanted to, he could improve his life with the money he got in memory of his daughter, but Teen Shanmugam and mother s Anantham created a library so that the lives of the children of the rest can be improved
 anita kii pratimaa bhi yahaan lagi he or uske potrate bhi lagaae gaye
 Before the arrival of NEET system, children of Tamil Nadu villages also used to become doctors on the basis of numbers, but since the time NEET has come, it has become difficult for students like Anita

 Various excuses are being adopted, but if there is no facility to raise voice, how would the story of Hidayatullah National University of Law students reach you
 lakhanu ke hazaratganj kii sadakon par barish main car kii safai karte noujvaan isliye aisa kar rahe hai taaki sarkaar kaa in par dhyaan jaae or unki maang suni jaae
 Their demand is that there are more than 26000 vacancies of sub-inspectors in Uttar Pradesh
 inhone mukhyamantri ko gyaapan diya he ki sab inspector kii 2011 ke baad se bhartee nahin hui he
 Now that 6500 people have passed, all can be kept because they have passed after two and a half years of process
 agar sarkaar 3308 padon par hi bahaali karegi to baaki 3000 se adhik chaatr paas hokar bhi naukari se vanchit ho jaaenge or agali bharti ke liye unke paas umr nahin bachegi
 That is why they are cleaning the car sometimes, they are giving picketing sometimes so that the government will listen to them
 ravivaar ko in logon ne dharna bhi diya magar hua kuch nahin
 Indian Railways had recently increased the number of seats a few days before the commencement of the examination, but after the result, the government will have to take a decision on whether the number of seats can be increased
 2015 main sab inspector kii bahaali nikali jo radd ho gai
 Then in 2016 i 3308 posts
 iskaa riselt aa gaya he magar bharti kii prakriya abhi tak chal hi rahi he
 2016 to 2018 arrived
 do-do baar pariksha hui or paper li hone ke kaaran radd bhi hui
 Students are also asking why the new recruitment examination of the inspector is not coming
 aath maheene pehle khabar chhapi thi ki jaldi aegi magar abhi tak nahin ai he
 In the year of 2017, s Anita, a talented girl from Tamil Nadu committed suicide
 ve doctor bananaa chaahati thim lekin medical pariksha neet paas nahin kar sakin
 After Anita's suicide, there were many protests in Tamil Nadu about Neet
 taminalnadu main rajya str par anita topper main se ek thi
 There was merit at the state level and according to that, medical colleges were available
 neet aane se garib chaatro ke liye mushkil ho gaya kyonki pariksha kaa pattern badal gaya tha
 Anita had brought 1176 out of 1200 in 12th level at Tamil Nadu level
 physics main 100 main 100 number laai thi phir bhi neet ke kaaran doctor nahin ban saki or anita ne aatmahatya kar lee
 The comments anita kii maut ke ek saal baad uski yaad main ek librari banaai gai he
 This library has been built at a cost of 45 lakhs
 anita kii maut ke baad kai raajnneetik dalon or sanghathanon ne uske parivaar ko paise die the, jiskaa istamaal kar uske mata pita ne anita kii yaad main ek librari hi bana di
 It has 2500 books
 anita ke maa-baap mazaduri karte the
 If he wanted to, he could improve his life with the money he got in memory of his daughter, but Teen Shanmugam and mother s Anantham created a library so that the lives of the children of the rest can be improved
 anita kii pratimaa bhi yahaan lagi he or uske potrate bhi lagaae gaye
 Before the arrival of NEET system, children of Tamil Nadu villages also used to become doctors on the basis of numbers, but since the time NEET has come, it has become difficult for students like Anita
 dollar ke mukaable rupaya aaj or gir gaya
 The price of one dollar was 71 rupees 21 paise
 itnaa adhik to rupaya kabhi nahin gira tha
 From August 16 to September 3, the price of petrol has increased by about 2 rupees
 kai shaharon main petrol 86-87 rupee prati litre mil rahaa he
 The Chief Justice of India should take this to notice immediately
 kyonki enelue raipur jinke naam par he justise hidayatullah bhi bharat ke 11wein mukhya nyaayadhish the
 Therefore, it is important to seriously investigate the complaint of the students and take a decisive decision on it
 suniye hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity of lau kii chatraayen kya kah rahi hai
 In a law university, a student should say that she was told in a class that you look very beautiful, come forward and sit so that the mind of the teacher and the students are also seen
 ek lau uniwarsity kii chaatra se yah kaha jaae ki college ke kaarykram main tumne dance acha kiya he, ab kamare main dance karke dikhaao
 This is such a serious matter that it must be investigated
 hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity of lau kii chaatraon ke bich 180 panne kii copy ghumaai gai
 He was asked to record his experience in this copy, and 177 pages were filled by looking
 har panne par sexual hairaasament kii koi na koi ghatana darj he
 Not only this, a form was prepared on Google and even when alumni were asked, there were 78 pages of complaints, which mention incidents of sexual harassment and commentary
 in chaatraon main se kal koi vakil banegi, jaj banegi, kya pataa chif justise of india banegi, aisi chaatraon ke college jivan kaa ye anubhav hoga
 There should be more action than shame on this
 uniwarsity ke register kaa kahana he ki unke paas yon utpeedan kii koi aupchaarik shikaayat abhi tak nahin ai he
 In the early days, these complaints were not formalized due to fear, ie written complaints were less accumulated but these agitating students say that many complaints have been made but no action has been taken
 isiilie is campus main hamen chahie azaadi kaa naaraa lag rahaa he
 The Chief Justice of India should get a 180-page copy and take serious action on the complaints of law university students
 is campus main pinjadaa tod andolan bhi chalaa he
 Meaning the students are asking for freedom to study in the library till late night and go out of the hostel after 10:30
 kuch chaatro ne bataaya ki ek minute bhi der ho jaati he, saadhe das kii jagah 10 baj kar 31 minute ho jaataa he to sidhaa phone ghar chalaa jaataa he
 Different things start to be told there again
 kapadon kaa byora bhi diya jane lagata he ki kalege main kya pahenti he kya nahin
 Even a phone call was made to a student that she drinks alcohol, drugs, smokes cigarettes
 jiskaa koi tuk nahin tha
 a student has also alleged to have checked the form in non-attendance
 hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity of lau ke chaatro ne jokhim liya he
 From the sexual harrassment to the closing of the library from ten to half past ten, it has broken the tradition of remaining silent on all kinds of disturbances
 unhen pataa he ki agar jeet nahin mili, logon kaa saath nahin mila to phir se unheen ke saamne khadey honge jinase sexual hairaasament kii shikaayatein hai
 This is not the case
 is lau uniwarsity main 65 saal se zyaada umr tak vaais chancelar nahin rah saktaa
 The Vice Chancellor raised the age limit in the Working Committee to 70 years
 usee uniwarsity ke ek shikshak ne jab hai court main chunauti di to vaais chancelar cese haar gaye
 His appointment was canceled because he is over 65 years old
 isi ke baad se chaatr andolan par utar aae kyonki vaais chancelar apni kursii bachaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The movement is gaining momentum
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen faisla chahie
 They will not back down from assurance
 ravi shankar sharma ko antarim taur par kulapati niyukt kiya gaya he
 He addressed the students and also heard the problems
 guzarish kii ki chaatr jaldi class room main laut aae
 The interim Vice Chancellor has assured the girl students that action will be taken against the teachers
 magar chaatro kaa kahana he ki unki sabhi maangen nahin maani ja rahi hai isliye ve apane andolan ko khatm nahin karenge
 Their demand is also that the warden of the hostel should not be a teacher, otherwise they bring out the anger of the hostel in the class room
 class main dekh lene kii dhamkee dete hai
 In the prime time of July 9, we had told that studies at Manipur University have been stalled for 40 days and in support of the students there, the chairman of about 28 departments has resigned from his post
 alag-alag academik skulon ke 5 dean ne bhi istapha de diya he
 Even after our news of that day, there was another 45 days of agitation
 yani 85 dinon tak andolan chalaa jo 30 may se shuru hua tha
 Then came the news that the HR Ministry has sent its VC AP Pandey on leave
 ab api pandey chuttee se laut aae hai or aate hi faisla kiya he ki yahaan shikshak sangh band, karmchaaree sangh band or chaatr sangh band
 Bain bain bain, dhain dhain dhain

 In the notification on Saturday, Pandey said that he has joined his duty
 
 
 1 sitambar ke aadesh main pandey ne kaha he ki manipur uniwarsity act 2005 main MUTA or MUSA jaisi karmchaariyon kii sansthaaon kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 
 
 It was said in the order that both these institutions are involved in disruptive activities in the university, which will create the current situation in the university
 
 
 aadesh se uniwarsity campus main in sansthaaon kii gatividhiyon par pabandi laga di gai he or kaha gaya he ki agar koi in gatividhiyon main shaamil hoga to uske kilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai kii jaaegi
 
 
 Vice Chancellor Pandey has also told the Indian Express that he has done so because teachers and staff unions were inciting students to protest and worsen the university atmosphere
 
 
 wo chaatro ko todphod kii ore dhakel rahe the jisase kai chaatro kaa bhavishya karaab ho rahaa tha
 
 
 Students and teachers have opposed this order and termed it as virtual
 
 
 MUTA kii ek apaat baithak main prastaav paas kiya gaya ki pandey ko tab tak uniwarsity campus main nahin ghusane diya jayega jab tak unke kilaaf jaanch or uske baad kii karrwai puri nahin ho jaati
 
 
 The proposal states that Pandey's virtual order shows how undemocratic and dictator he is
 
 
 MUSU, MUTA or MUSA kii ek saajha baithak main paas ek anya prastaav main kaha gaya he ki sarkaar 4 sitambar se pehle pandey ke adeshon par uchit karrwai kare
 
 
 He said that Pandey's orders during the holiday should be criticized and declared null and void so that they would not be binding on anyone
 
 
 MUTA ke pravaktaa profesar enen singh ne indian express ko bataaya ki agar 4 sitambar kii shaam tak hamaari maangon par koi jawaab nahin aata to ham apni hadtaal phir shuru kar denge
 
 
 If someone opens the factory to stop the noise, then his business will go on in India

 Some students said that it is too late for one minute, instead of ten and a half, it becomes ten to 31 minutes, then the direct phone goes home

 Clothes are also given details of what wears in the college or not

 Students at Hidayatullah National University of Law have taken a risk
 sexual hairaasament se lekar saadhe das baje tak librari band ho jane se lekar tamaam tarah kii gadabadiyon par chup rah jane kii parampara ko tod diya he
 They know that if they do not win, if they do not get the support of the people, then they will again stand in front of those who have complaints about sexual harassment

 The Law University cannot remain Vice Chancellor for more than 65 years of age
 vaais chancelar ne kaarysmiti main umr seemaa badhaakar 70 saal kar lee
 The Vice Chancellor lost the case when a teacher from the same university challenged it in the High Court
 unki niyukti radd ho gai kyonki ve 65 saal se zyaada ke ho chuke hai
 Since then, the students have come on the movement because the Vice Chancellor is trying to save his chair
 andolan teji pakadta ja rahaa he
 Students say they need a decision
 ve aashwaasan se peeche nahin hatenge
 Ravi Shankar Sharma has been tentatively appointed as the vice-chancellor
 unhone chaatro ko sambodhit kiya or samasyaayein bhi sunin
 Requested that the students return to the class room early
 antarim kulapati ne chaatraon ko aashwaasan diya he ki shikshakon ke khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 But the students say that all their demands are not being accepted, so they will not end their agitation
 inaki maang yah bhi he hastal kaa warden teacher na ho varna hastal kaa gussa ve class room main nikaalte hai
 Threatens to be seen in class
 9 july ke prime time main hamane bataaya tha ki manipur uniwarsity main 40 dinon se padhai thapp he or vahaan ke chaatro ke samarthan main kareeb 28 vibhaagon ke adhyaksh ne apane pad se istipha de diya he
 5 deans of different academic schools have also recommended
 hamaari us din kii khabar ke baad bhi 45 din or andolan chalaa tha
 That is, the movement lasted for 85 days which started from May 30
 phir khabar ai ki maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne vahaan ke visi api pandey ko chuttee par bhej diya he
 Now AP Pandey has returned from leave and has decided that teachers union closed, employees union closed and student union closed
 bain bain bain, dhain dhain dhain
 
 
 All the dishes from here to there in one go
 shanivaar ko aae notification main pandey ne kaha ki unhone apni duty join kar lee he
 
 
 In the September 1 order, Pandey has stated that the Manipur University Act 2005 does not have any provision for employees' organizations like MUTA and MUSA
 
 
 aadesh main kaha gaya ki ye donon hi sansthaaen uniwarsity main vighatnkaaree gatividhiyon main lipt hai jisase uniwarsity main maujuuda halaat bane
 
 
 The order has banned the activities of these institutions in the university campus and it has been said that disciplinary action will be taken against anyone if they are involved in these activities
 
 
 vaais chancelar pandey ne indian express ko bhi bataaya he ki unhone aisa kiya he kyonki shikshak or karmchaaree sangh chaatro ko virodh or uniwarsity kaa maahaul karaab karne ke liye uksaa rahe the
 
 
 He was pushing the students towards sabotage which was spoiling the future of many students
 
 
 chaatro or shikshakon ne is aadesh kaa virodh karte hue use virtual yani abhaasi bataaya he
 
 
 In an emergency meeting of the MUTA, the resolution was passed that Pandey would not be allowed to enter the university campus until the investigation and subsequent action against him was completed
 
 
 prastaav main kaha gaya he ki pandey kaa virtual order bataata he ki wo kitna aloktantric or taanashaah hai
 
 
 Another resolution passed at a joint meeting of MUSU, MUTA and MUSA states that the government should take appropriate action on Pandey's orders before 4 September
 
 
 unhone kaha ki chuttee ke dauraan die gaye pandey ke adeshon kii aalochana kii jaae or unhen null and void ghoshit kiya jaae taaki wo kisi par badhyakaari naa rahen
 
 
 MUTA spokesperson Professor NN Singh told The Indian Express that if there is no response to our demands by the evening of September 4, we will resume our strike
 
 
 awaz band karne kii factory koi khol le to uskaa dhandha bharat main khub chal padegaa
 Various excuses are being adopted, but if there is no facility to raise voice, how would the story of Hidayatullah National University of Law students reach you
 lakhanu ke hazaratganj kii sadakon par barish main car kii safai karte noujvaan isliye aisa kar rahe hai taaki sarkaar kaa in par dhyaan jaae or unki maang suni jaae
 Their demand is that there are more than 26000 vacancies of sub-inspectors in Uttar Pradesh

 co / d9xsuqrjti— rajamouli ss (@ssrajamouli)april 30, 2017 India's great batsman Sunil Gavaskar has questioned the decision to naturally retain Virat Kohli as captain even after India's defeat in the World Cup semi-finals
 gavaskar maanate hai ki kohli ko dobaaraa captaini saunpe jane se pehle aadhikarik baithak honi chahie thi
 In his article published in mid-day, Gavaskar has written, "if he (selector) has selected the captain for the tour of West Indies without any meeting, then the question arises whether Kohli is the captain of the team or because of his selection committee
 There are reasons for happiness
 'gavaskar ne likhaa, 'hamaari jaankaree ke mutabik unki (kohli) niyukti vishwa cap tak ke liye hi thi
 After this the selectors should have called a meeting on this issue
 yah alag baat he ki yah meeting paanch minute hi chalati, lekin aisa hona chahie tha
 The All India Selection Committee headed by MSK Prasad has appointed Kohli as the captain of the three formats for the West Indies tour
 is siries kii shuruyaat florida main hone vaale tii-20 muqablon se hogi
 After this, the Committee of Administrators (COA) constituted by the Supreme Court made it clear that it will not call a review meeting on the performance of the team in the World Cup, but it will consider the report of the team manager about the performance of the team in this World Cup
 
 aaj press conference karenge viraat kohli, kya denge in 5 chubte sawaalon ke jawaab?gavaskar ne puure maamle kaa makhul udaate hue likhaa ki aakhirkaar kohli kyon manamafik team chunane kaa haq pate rahe hai
 Gavaskar wrote, 'people in the selection committee are puppets
 punarniyukti ke baad kohli ko meeting main team ko lekar apane vichaar rakhane ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 Bypassing the process sent the message that Kedar Jadhav, Dinesh Karthik were dropped from the team due to poor performance, while during and before the World Cup, the captain had relied on these players and the result was that the team was also in the final Could not reach 'bisisiai ke ek tabake kaa yah maananaa tha ki 2023 vishwa cap ke dhyaan main rakhte hue teenon formet ke liye alag-alag captain banaaya janaa ek acha kadam ho saktaa tha or isse aane vaale samay main team ko phayda hota

 supreme court ne hoicourt ke us faisle ko palatakar rakh diya he ki dilli ke asli prashaasak up rajyapal hai
 The constitution bench sitting under the chairmanship of the largest judge of the highest court of the country has cleared the fiber of Delhi's power, no politics, no fuss, and nothing here and there
 alji nahin mukhyamantri hai dilli ke asli maalik
 The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has reiterated the spirit of democracy in which no eye can show the decision of the elected government, elected representative and elected assembly

 Now understand what the ten biggest meanings of the Supreme Court's decision are

 Second, the elected government is responsible for the people, not LG

 Fourthly, only LG has to take decisions on the advice of the cabinet, they do not have independent rights

 During the hearing, the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) told the court that the Delhi government was not providing full funds in the rape victim compensation scheme in the capital, causing difficulty in giving compensation to the victims

 The High Court has directed the Delhi government to immediately release eight crore rupees to DSLSA

 maakan ne maamle kii jaanch sanyukt sansadeey samiti (JPC) se karaane kii maang doharaai he

 The budget of the film is not very high
 10-15 karod ru
 This film is a budget between star cast bahut saamaanya he or kahani bhi koi bahut damdaar nahin he
 In such a situation, the film is good for laughter
 lekin isse bahut zyada ummid karnaa galat hoga
 The rest of the people are on Janardan

 a report of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NIRI) to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is awaited to protect the Taj Mahal
 yahi report tay karegi ki tajmahal dekhne ke liye aane waalon kii sankhya kis tarah niyantrit kii jaae
 There is a big concern behind this wait
 abhi jis tarah setajmahal kii mukhya imaratpar bheed jamaa hoti he, vah uske liye khatra ban gai he
 The ASI suspects that if the arrangements are not made in time, the building will crack, which will be difficult to bridge
 kya he khatra?tajmahal kii neenv lakdi ke gheron par aadhaarit he
 These wooden enclosures rest on a well-like structure
 jinhen yamuna ke pani se nami milti he
 But the water level of the Yamuna is not getting moisture due to the low level of water
 yah tajmahal ke liye ek bada khatra he
 Every day, more than 50 thousand tourists come to see the Taj Mahal
 unki maujuudagi se tajmahal kii mukhya imaarat par padane vaala dabaav is khatre ko or zyada badha rahaa he
 The main building floor is prone to cracks due to overpressure
 ye daraaren bad bhi sakati hai
 The Supreme Court had entrusted the task of finding a solution to this problem of Taj Mahal to the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (niri), Nagpur
 niri ke vaigyanikon ne tajmahal kii vishesh jaanch kii
 For several months, different types of surveys were conducted
 tajmahal par mandara rahe khatre ko kam karne ke liye sabhi pahulon kii tathyon ke aadhaar par jaanch kaa kaam niri ne puraa kar liya
 Control of the number of tourists: This danger can be reduced by controlling the number of tourists visiting Taj Mahal
 iske liye eesai ne prastaav bhi taiyaar kiye the
 The ASI believes that tourists should be sent to the Taj Mahal at an average of 3 thousand per hour
 is tarah se aath ghante main 24 hajaar paryatak tajmahal dekh sakenge
 The ticket duration should be reduced to one hour
 moujda tikat puure din ke liye hota he
 There is no time limit in that
 isi tarah se mukhya imaarat (jo puri tarah safed sangemarmar se bana he) par paryatakon kii entry ko band kiye jane, tajmahal main mukhya smarak par jane ke liye alag se doosraa tikat lagane or paryatak ko keval ek taraf se gum kar nikaale jane (van-ve) jaise prastaav bhi supreme court ko bheje gaye hai
 Why is ASI worried? It has been 362 years since Taj Mahal
 isaki dekhbhaal kaa jimmaa bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan (eesai) ke kandhon par he
 Officials are upset over the increasing pressure on the Taj Mahal
 takreeban do saal kaa vakt bitne ko he
 But Niri has not yet submitted his report to the Supreme Court
 tajmahal ke sangrakshak sahaayak ejeeniyar munnjar ali bataate hai ki niri kii vistrut report nahin ai he
 So it is too early to say anything in this matter
 lekin ham tajmahal par badhate dabaav ko lekar chintit hai
 It is necessary to reduce the pressure on the main building
 par antim faisla niri ko karnaa he
 We will work on that basis
 gauratlab he ki tajmahal dekhne ke liye har saal 50 se 70 lakh paryatak agra aate hai
 Which includes about 12% foreign tourists
 yah sankhya har saal bad rahi he
 This is good for the tourism world
 lekin tajmahal ke liye yah bada khatra he
 Now ASI is awaiting Niri's report and directions
 apane svarnim daur, upie raaj main akaash tablet ko aam logon ko saste main computer uplabdh karaane kaa krantikari kadam mana ja rahaa tha
 But now there is a crisis in its existence
 kisi bhi mantralay yaa sarkari agency kii isamen koi dilchaspee nahin he
 Now, Akash can only emerge if it is included in the agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious plan 'digital India', in which indigenous level open courses and university equipped with wi-fi to promote education
 The network is designed
 akaash ke pairokaar purv maanav sansaadhan mantri kapil sibbal the jinhone ise bhartiya ejineering or nitigat kushalta kii misaal ke taur par pesh kiya tha
 However, from the very beginning, it had to face the foreign media and other critics, in whose opinion the government's work in consumer electronic products
 upie raaj main sibbal ke baad maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri bane em
 M
 pallam raju kii akaash pariyojna main zyada dilchaspee nahin rahi or ab endie raaj main smriti irani ke maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne to is adhuri pariyojna se haath hi khinch liya he
 He has left it at the mercy of the Department of Electronics and Information Technology and the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposal (DGS & D)
 asal main masachusets institute of technology ke nicholas negropont ‘van laptop par child’ ke liye bazaar talashne 2006-07 main bharat aae the
 He offered a laptop for a hundred dollars to bridge the digital divide in India
 tab arjuna singh ke netritv main maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne adhik keemat kaa hawala dekar ise thukraa diya
 The question was also raised whether it would be appropriate to hand over the computer in the hands of children at such a young age? Then, in 2009, when Sibal took over the ministry, he named the tablet Akash and campaigned vigorously for it
 isaki keemat 35 dollar rakhi gai thi jo bahut kam thi, isliye isane turant duniya kaa dhyaan khinchaa
 State governments, public sector undertakings, and even many countries became curious about this
 lekin isaki museebaton kaa silsilaa nahin thama
 First wrong start Rs 48 crore given to new IIT, iit-jodhpur, with the objective of 'providing low-cost computing-less-access devices'

 The role of the institute was limited to testing and purchasing about 1,00,000 devices and the contract to manufacture it was won by Canadian firm Datawind in 2011
 iity-jodhpur ne tablet ke pehle set ko yah kah kar lautaa diya ki ye ghatiya hai
 The matter was settled in court
 mantralay ne is pariyojna ko iity-jodhpur se lekar iity-bombai ko saunp diya
 But by then the doubts about the quality of the Akash device had deepened
 iity-bombai ne andeh dur karne main kamyaabi hasil kii or may 2013 tak datawind ne nae or behatar akaash-2 tablet banaakar bheje
 New and useful educational apps were loaded in it and these were sent to various institutions across the country
 ek adhikari kehete hai, “akaash-2 ko chaatro ne upyogi mana, khaskar jab iity-bombai ne ejineering paathyakram ke anukool aplications shaamil kiye hai
 a report by iit-bombay on Akash-2 says that it is getting good response
 lekin sibbal ke vidaa hote hi iske din lad gaye
 When Raju took charge of the ministry in 2012, he created a stir by raising the issue of review of the Akash project
 kaig kii ek report main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kii behatar or puraane iity kii bajaae ek nae or kam saadhan sampann iity ko anubandh dene ke liye kadi aalochana kii gai thi
 Others were questioning why the ministry is spending its energy in tablets
 is saal janvari main dijies and di ne akaash-4 ke liye nividaayen aamantrit kin
 The Pune-based Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) suddenly suggested that Aakash's suitability should be re-evaluated after the Lok Sabha elections, keeping in mind the government's new digital agenda
 ab, irani ne akaash-4 kaa ullekh tak nahin kiya he
 Te clouds that thunder, it does not rain
 aisa hi kuch rajat ravel ke bare main bhi kah sakate hai

 On getting out of the house, Rajat said, “I came to Bigg Boss house with lots of preparations
 lekin kharaab sehat kii vajah se main apana best nahin de sakaa
 My biggest strength in my life is my daughter and i am happy that i have given her happiness by coming to Bigg Boss house

 The answers that have come from this petition are not only shocking, but they say that the wait for salary increase will be long

 Instead, these women Group a officers have yet to work from the old salary

 Oil companies reduced petrol prices by 95 paise per liter
 antarrashtriya bazaar main daam ghatane baad yah katautee kii gai
 This is the second reduction in the price of petrol after October
 ye daam guuruuvaar madhya raatri se prabhavi honge
 Petrol price currently 68 in Delhi
 19 rupee litre he
 It decreased to 67 from Friday
 24 rupee prati litre rah jayega
 However, due to different local sales tax or VAT rates, prices will vary in different cities
 isse pehle 9 oktober ko petrol ke daam main 56 paise prati litre kii katautee kii gai thi
 After that, the government's decision to increase the commission of petrol pump dealers increased the prices by 29 paise per liter
 indian oil corporation ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘philhal antarrashtriya str par tel ke daam kamobesh sthir hai
 'petrol price in Mumbai 1
 20 rupee prati litre ghatakar 73
 53 rupees a liter is left
 vahiin chennai main kal se petrol 71
 70 reduced from Rs 77
 57 rupee litre rah jayega
 Price 1 in Kolkata 19 rupee ghatakar 74

 centre sarkaar ne dil ke marijon ko badi raahat di he
 The central government has reduced the prices of drug-dependent stents (DES) by 8 percent
 dawa kii keemton kii dekharekh karne vaali kendriya sanstha neshnal pharmaceutical prising athurity (NPPA) ne isaki ghoshnaa kii he
 This waiver has come into force with this announcement and will be applicable till 31 March next year
 jaaniye kitna chukaana hoga DES stant ke liebonphpha ne bataaya ki ab tak aapako dawa lage stant ke liye 30180 rupee chukaane padate the
 However, after this deduction, they have been priced at Rs 27890
 base metal se bana stant hry mahangaaek taraf jahaan sarkaar ne deies ke maamle main raahat di he
 At the same time, it has increased the prices of stents made of base metal
 is ghoshnaa ke baad base metal se bane stant kii keemat 7660 rupee ho gai he
 Earlier, you had to pay 7400 rupees for this
 acchhee baat yah he ki base metal se bane stant kii badhati keemton kaa zyada asar marijon par nahin hoga
 Because more than 95 percent of heart patients in the country use DES only
 pichley saal bhi mili thi rahatpichley saal bhi sarkaar ne dil ke marijon ko sabase badi raahat di thi
 The government then cut stent prices by about 85 percent
 yah ghoshnaa bhi sarkaar ne farvari maheene main hi kii thi
 Along with this, the government had also reduced the price of a stent made of base metal and reduced it to Rs 7400
 isi dauraan dawa lage stant kii keemat ko ghataakar 30180 rupee kar diya gaya tha
 After about a year, again, the government has announced a relief in the prices of stented medicines, giving relief to heart patients
 uthaaya ye bhi kadamdanpapha ne nijee aspataalon ko bhi stant ke istemaal ko lekar sakht nirdesh die hai
 He has said that whenever preparing a hospital bill, the price of other products should be different from the hospital bill
 iske saath hi usne 15 march tak suzav bhi maange hai
 Therefore, this step was taken
 Last year, when the NPPA cut stent prices, many private hospitals raised the prices of other products used in heart disease
 isaki vajah se dil ke marijon ko milane vaali raahat naakaafi sabit ho jaati thi
 In view of this, NPPA has taken this step
 vidhi ayog kii sifarish or chunaav ayog kii chitthee ke baavjood is baat ke asaar kam hai ki matdaan ke 48 ghante pehle akhabaaron or soshal media par bhi chunavi vigyaapan par roak lagegi
 The Election Commission has then written to the Central Government asking them to amend Section 126 of the Representation of People Act i
e
 RP Act
 haalanki ab sansad ke maujuuda satr ke samaapan main sirf teen din hi rah gaye hai or sarkaar ke vidhaayi agenda main ye he bhi nahin
 In a letter to the Union law ministry, the commission has asked to add another provision in section 126 of the Representation of the People Act
 dhara 126 (1) ke tahat electronic media jisame tivi channelon ke saath-saath sarkari or nijee radio, cabel or satellite ke zarie chalane vaale prasaaran par chunavi vigyaapan yaa saamagree dikhaane par pabandi he
 At the same time, in the original stream, after the termination of the election period, there is a ban on holding public meeting, showing election material in cinema or theater
 silence period matdaan shuru hone ke samay se thik 48 ghante pehle shuru ho jaataa he
 According to the recommendation of the Commission, the inclusion of Section 126 (2) of RP Act and Section 2 (w) in IT Act will solve the problem
 arapy act 126 main praavdhaan (2) jodakar print media, news portal, print media ke digital varjan or mobile ke zarie soshal media plateforms par chunavi saamagree kaa prasaaran roka ja saktaa he
 Also, due to the absence of rules, the courts also have the right to interfere
 lihaaja sarkaar act main sanshodhan kar is baat kaa bhi saaf vidhaayi praavdhaan kar de ki adaalatein is par koi dakhal naa den jab tak ayog yaa rajyon ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari shikaayat darj naa karen
 Before this letter of the Commission, the Law Commission has also recommended this change and amendment in its 255th report
