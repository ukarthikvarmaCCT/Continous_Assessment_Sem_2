 He will give time to the party to elect a new president

 saath hi sutron kaa yah bhi kahana he ki saptaah bhar se congress netaa unhen manaane main jute hai or lekin rahul gandhi ne apana man nahin badla
 Officially, the party told reporters on Saturday that Rahul Gandhi's offer of resignation was' unanimously rejected
 'congress kaaryakarini kii baithak main rahul gandhi chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress netaaon ke deelepan ko lekar un par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He also said that many leaders of the party put their sons ahead of the party and pressured them to get tickets
 haalanki, rahul gandhi ne kisi kaa naam nahin kiya, lekin kai varisht netaaon ke bete or betiyon ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 These include Vaibhav Gehlot, son of Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Congress General Secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia, Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, and Sushmita Dev, daughter of former Union Minister Santosh Mohan Dev

 RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav has once again written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 khat main unhone modi sarkaar ko katghare main khadey karne kii koshish kii he
 Lalu has blamed the BJP and RSS for the assault on Dalit youths in Una, Gujarat
 saath hi unhone gau raksha ke naam par desh main ho rahe aparaadh par piem kii chuppi par sawaal uthaaya he
 Lalu's letter to PM Narendra Modi: Respected Modiji, i would like to humbly bring to your attention the unfortunate incident that took place in Una, 360 km from Ahmedabad in your home state of Gujarat, about which Home Minister Rajnath Singhji stood in Parliament Said that you are deeply hurt by this incident
 ji haa, main usee ghatana kii baat kar rahaa hum jisamen chamada udyog se jude chaar dalit yuvakon ko berahami se saream buree tarah se sirf isiilie peeta gaya kyonki unhone apni aajeevika ke liye mari hui gaayon ke khaal ko utaara tha
 Those who are creating violent so-called cow-guard teams etc
 like mushrooms in the name of cow-service and cow protection, the RSS and yours are the biggest hands behind this fire
 pehle loksabhaa chunaav or haal hi main hue bihar vidhansabha chunaavon main jis gaiyr-jimmedaari se pink revolushan, gau maance, gaay paalane vaale or gaay khaane vaale aadi gaiyr jaruri baton par samaaj todane vaale bhadakaau bhaashan die gaye the, unheen kaa yah asar he kii aaj kisaan kharid kar gaayon ko gaadi main ladakar le jane se bhi darataa he
 On the way, who will surround them in the name of cow protection or beat them or kill them
 aapane to logon ko baantkar, jehar ropakar voton kii khub kheti kii or jo chaahate the wo ban gaye
 But your sown poison is living in the form of a racist and communal snake, takes up the frenzy from time to time and goes on burying the peace and harmony of the country, i am very sad that i have to tell the Prime Minister of our country That this fire is on you
 is aag main bhasma hokar jo goupalak, kisaan bandhu, dalit, adivasee or alpsankhyak mar rahe hai, uske doshi sirf aap, aapaki party or aapaki ashishnu vichaardhaara kii janani sangh he
 If i do not stand you in the dock today, the cow-guard inside me will never forgive me
 puure desh samet videshi media bhi jaanata tha ki hindustan main jameen evam garibon se judaa ek janasevak he lalu yadav jo lutyens dilli ke bangale or mukhyamantri awaas main bhi gau-mata rakhata he
 When i was singing in a bungalow in Delhi, i was called Gwala and Guar by the casteists, i do not keep cows to show, i used to keep cows even when there was nothing and still keep it
 aaj bhi shaayad milakar bijepi ke sabhi netaaon ke paas itani gaayen nahin hongi jitani hamaare awaas or khataal (gaushala) main he
 What about leaders who distribute people in cow's name with cow-service? 78 ministers of your jumbo cabinet live in big bungalows in Delhi
 kitnon ne apane bhimkaay bangalon main gaayen paali hui hai? kute jarur paal rakhe honge
 But cows will shrink their nose and eyeballs because their so-called high class states will not allow them to! In Bihar, you gave big lectures in newspapers on cow-love and crores in newspapers
 modiji, agar sachmuch aap gau prem karte hai to aap apane har mantri ke liye niyam banaaie ki har koi apane bangalon main gaay paalega
 He will take care of them with his own hands, bathe them, feed them and even duly cremate them on death, so that while carrying the dead cows from their bungalows, your workers do not kill those Dalits or backward
 oona kii ghatana apane aap main koi anokhi yaa ekmaatr ghatana nahin he, aae din yah paagalpan desh ke kisi naa kisi kone main apana nanga naach dikhaata he or aap duusari ore munh pher lete hai
 You people go away by voting politics but the poor pay for it with their income, happiness, prospects and life
 gau-raksha ke naam par manuaadi iskaa prayog apane haathon se dhire-dhire khiskate nirankushta ko pun hathiyaane ke liye karte hai, dalit pichhadon ko unki 'jagah' dikhaane ke liye karte hai
 Cows across the country eat garbage on the roadside, but no cow lover will feed it two loaves
 bhukh, pyaas, garmi, beemaari se ye gaayen dam tod detii hai par koi gau rakshak isaki sud lene nahin aayega
 But not only the whole village, but BJP workers from the surrounding villages also get involved in killing any Akhlaq on cow meat
 thik usee tarah gaay par raajnneeti karne chunaavon main aap log jute jate hai
 Now this farce of the Sangh and the BJP should stop
 ab desh ko yah bardaasht nahin he ki kisi 'maan bharti ke santaan' rohit vemula kii sansthagat hatya par pradhanmantri kaa marm ek hafte baad jaage
 The Dalits and Backward Union of the country refuse to obey the imposed code of conduct
 apane virodh or pradarshan se daliton ne gujarat kii sarkaar ko apane mahatv kaa abhas karaayaa he, samaaj ko aaina dikhaaya he or apane andar pal rahe katutaa kaa ek jhalak maatr dikhaaya he
 Prime Minister, stop trying to re-instill the Brahminical and Manuvadi mentality on Dalits, backward and tribals from the back door, otherwise the result will be destructive for the country
 desh kaa bahusankhyak varg desh main hajaaron saal tak chalane vaale kaale saamaajik dhaanche kii punrariti kisi keemat par hone nahin degaa

 NDTV visited several other gaushalas including Ayodhya and Mirzapur in UP from where news of the death of cows was coming
 baliya ke tehseeldaar shivsagar dube ne NDTV ko bataaya ki chaar bachade to mere saamne hi mare pade hai
 And the reason for his death is not that there are many diseases

 upi sarkaar dwaara 2019-20 ke bajet main gau sangrakshan ke liye kul 600 karod rupee aavantit kiye gaye the

 He says that these cows get nothing to eat except straw
 jis vajah se yahaan rahane vaali zyada gaaye kamjor ho rahi he or baad main unki maut ho ja rahi he
 The young man who cares for the cows told NDTV that a cow living here should get five kilos of husk, one kilo of bran, one kilo of mustard cake, half kilo of cottonseed and five kilos of green fodder every day
 lekin inhen sirf bhusa hi mil paata he
 NDTV spoke to Dayaram, the caretaker of the Gaushalas in Barabanki and Sobhadra, about the condition of the cows

 "my pressure did work," says Rahul Gandhi in Parliament on withdrawal of tax on EPF — ANI (@ani_news) March 8, 2016 23 may ko jo bhi nattejey aaen, bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii states report taiyaar he - unka kad gata diya gaya he
 68-year-old Nitish Kumar is being considered very inferior in Indian politics due to the constant changing of partners
 bhale hi wo ab bhi bihar ke mukhyamantri hai lekin pichley maheene ke aakhir main piem modi ke saath ek hi manch par unke buje hue chehre ne unki dasha jaahir kar di
 Nitish did not raise slogans of 'bharat Mata Ki Jai' and sat silent on the stage
 piem modi kii bihar raily main nitish kumaar shant baithe rahe jabaki baaki log vande maataram ke naare lagaate rahe
 Nitish is proud of his expressionless face
 ek baar patna main mukhyamantri awaas par ek tivi intervyuu ke dauraan mujhe unhen rokte hue kahana padaa tha ki unke javaabon main panch kii kami he
 Nitish immediately understood and said 'let's shoot again' but also said that i am not like other Bihari politicians who laugh out loud
 unka ishaara lalu yadav kii taraf tha jo apni panchalinon ke liye jane jate hai or jo kabhi siyasat main unke saajhedaar rahe to kabhi dushman
 This comment also shows how Nitish always distinguishes himself from his rivals
 us samay unke sabase bade pratidwandi gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke rup main narendra modi the
 In 2015, Kumar tied up with him and the Congress, eliminating rivalry with Lalu
 2017 main ve waapas bijepi ke netritv vaale endie main shaamil ho gaye
 In an open letter issued on Monday before the final phase of polling in Bihar, Lalu has called him 'opportunistic'
 ye aisa aarope he jis par kai log asahmat nahin honge
 Even though Nitish has managed to beat the Yadav clan surrounded by allegations of corruption because of the pact with Modi and Shah, he also relinquished his ambition to become Prime Minister, which he had been pursuing for decades
 tab tak nitish kumaar ko vipaksh main pradhanmantri pad kaa aisa daavedaar mana jaataa rahaa jise lekar sabhi sahamat hote
 But now he is one of the bjp's many allies
 amit shah jinhen bhartiya raajnneeti main sabase sakht molbhav karne vaala mana jaataa he, ne bhale hi nitish ke liye bijepi jitani yani 17 siten chodi hon, lekin yah keval raajnneetik phaayde ke liye he na ki endie main nitish kumaar ke bade hue darje kaa pratibimb he
 Says a leader of Lalu's party, "nitish has lost his status in Bihar
 ab unki vah dabang chhavi bhi nahin bachi, jo bihar kii raajnneeti main bahut myne rakhti he
 "he said," Lalu is prevented from contesting the election by putting him in prison in prison, but wonders that he is still domineering
 log ye bhi jaanate hai ki nitish modi se apni ladaai haar chuke hai
 And the voter does not like the losers
 ''nitish kumaar, jo kurmi jati se aate hai, jo ki bihar ke jatil jaateey sameekaran main 4 fisadi kii hissedari rakhata he, saalon tak yadav jaise rajanetaaon ke pitthu bane rahe, jinka kaaphi bada jaateey aadhaar he
 In all his acumen for power, Kumar did not see his image of an honest politician against corruption tarnished
 parishram se gadhi hui sushasan babu kii unki chhavi jisane lalu yadav ke 'jangal raaj' ko khatm kiya, ne unke liye wo jagah banaai ki satta ke liye kiye gaye unke aniatik kaaryon ko bhi anukool vyakhya mili
 This time, however, this benign image of him has been attacked
 khaas taur par lalu ke bete tejasvi yadav badi reliyon main behad chapaltaa se hasya ke saath unako nishaanaa banaate rahete hai or unhen 'chachcha' kahkar pukaarte hai
 In 2016, Nitish Kumar banned liquor in the state which was probably inspired by Gujarat and was probably a wrong decision
 nitish kaa akalan tha ki isse puure rajya se apane kurmi janaadhar main mahila matadaataaon ko jod paaenge
 However the reality is something else
 sharabbandi kii vajah se sharaab kaa kaala kaarobaar puure rajya main phala-phula or police thane aapurti centre bane
 Nitish could not control the liquor mafia
 nitish ke achche prashaasak kii chhavi ko tab or bada dhakka laga jab unki hi party ke kai log sharaab kii kalabazari main lipt paae gaye
 BJP has moved ahead at the expense of Nitish in Bihar
 kumaar ko laga ki vah laalkrishna adwani ke samay kii bijepi ke saath deal kar rahe hai jo unhen pasand karte the, lekin ab wo khud ko amit shah ke saamne pate hai jo behad kushal raajnneetijna hai
 Unbelievably, he once again thought of changing the ground and gave a message to the opposition before the seat deal with BJP
 congress ko unase kuch had tak sahanubhuti thi lekin yadav parivaar ne dobaaraa rishta jodne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 For a person like him who is extremely cautious about his image, it is definitely painful for him to mock his leadership
 koi aashcharya nahin he ki unka cheharaa aisa buja dikhataa he

 Rahul Dravid once said that catching catches in slip is not easy
 lekin is bodhvakya se tej gendbaaj pankaj singh ko tasalli nahin mil sakati
 In fact, he had a sleepless night before making his debut in India's third Test match against England at Southampton Aegis Bowl in England
 test match kii subah saurav ganguli ne rajasthan ke 6 foot 5 inch oonche gendbaaj ko bharat kii cap dete samay uski ghabrahat dur karne kii koshish kii, “zyada lod mat lenaa, apane pehle test kaa majaa lo
 Pankaj's 13th ball proved to be Alastair Cook's fate, short of length ball touching Cook's bat
 gend third slip main khadey baayen haath se khilne vaale rabindra jadeja kii ore gai, unke ghutanon tak uchhali or haath main aa gai
 But what is this, the ball was slashed by hand
 yani kaich tapak gaya
 The incident of missing out on Jadeja reminds me of Graham Gooch missing a catch from Kiran More at Lord's in 1990
 gooch tab 36 par khel rahe the, lekin kaich chhootane ke baad unhone us pari main 333 ran banaae
 Cook could not make so many runs, but after missing a catch, Cook, playing at 15, succumbed to 95 after his life
 tab ve kariyar ke bure daur se guzar rahe the, lekin 95 ran banane ke baad team main unki jagah jarur majboot ho gai
 As far as England is concerned, after missing this catch, the pressure on England was reduced, which was maintained by the Indian team till the first hour of the match
 bharat na sirf match haara balki siries main use jo mahatvapurn badhat haath aa rahi thi, vah bhi ganvaa baitha
 And India's 282nd Test Cap Pankaj lost a big chance
 is siries main chauthaa test shuru hone tak bharat wicket ke peeche ke aath maukey ganvaa chukaa tha
 During the second match at Lord's, Gary Ballance was batting on 28 when neither Mahendra Singh Dhoni nor Shekhar Dhawan stood on the first slip
 nateeja yah niklaa ki bailance ne shatak jad diya
 India eventually won the match but Fielding's flaws were made known
 slip main jadeja ke bare main purv ol rounder kapil dev kaa kahana he, “galat jagah par galat fielder
 Have you ever seen Janti Rhodes on slips? He may be the best fielder of our generation but Yuvraj Singh, Jadeja and even Kohli are quite nimble
 sarkal yaa outfield main fielding karte hue unki manshaa bhagkar gend lapakane kii hoti he
 But this technique does not succeed in slip because you have to let the ball come into your hand comfortably
 mujhe pankaj ke liye afsos he
 Had he taken that catch, he could have taken more wickets
 bharat kaa pradarshan behatar ho saktaa tha
 We had to pay a heavy price for that moment
 ”ek sachaai yah bhi he ki rahul dravid or or vivies lakshmana ke khel se ritair hone ke baad bharat kaa kshetrarakshan thik ho hi nahin paaya he
 Both these silp fielders have records of 210 and 135 test catches respectively
 team ne paanch khilaadi fasrt slip main aajamaae hai—pehle dravid kaa yahaan kshetrarakshan gajab kaa hota tha
 About 10 players have been tried at slip cardon but there are flaws that are not taking the name of the finish
 is saal ke shuru main oakland test ko yaad kariye jab newjiland team 30 ran par 3 wicket ganvaa chuki thi or murali vijay ke haath se ken ko phenki mohammad shami kii gend chhot gai
 Kane scored 113 and added 221 runs in the fourth wicket with Brendon mccullum
 is match main bharat ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 There are many technical flaws in India's fielding, due to which the already weak bowling puts more weight
 ye kamiyaan hai—specialistus kii grouming na karnaa or kai fielderon ko aajmaana, asantulit body pojishan, haathon kii galat mudra or kai maamalon main slip temparament kii kami
 For example, the series saw new slip fielders placing their hands on their knees (this position was popularized by Ian Botham but no one could imitate it)
 sabase zyada hairaan karne vaali cheez he slip ke bich main duuri—yaa kahen ki isaki kami
 As Sunil Gavaskar noted that they were standing very close to each other and the motion was being interrupted (gavaskar mr
 fasrt slip kahe jate hai, jinhen sharajah main 1985 main bharat-pakistan ke bich kam score vaale van de match main main of da match kaa puraskaar mila tha)
 Butler, who was playing the first Test of his career, fell to Dhawan at the first slip in England's second innings at Southampton
 darasal dhawan kaaphi peeche khadey the or gend unase kuch inch pehle hi gir gai
 In this test, such accidents happened not once but several times
 dive lagaakar aise kaichon ko lapakane ke liye mashhoor rahe mohammad ajaharuddin kehete hai, “aapako andaaj lagaana hota he or palak jhapakate ek kathin maukey ko kaich main badal dena hota he
 Catching such catches is the best way to boost team morale
 ”lakshmana kaa fielding mantra he, “naram haath or thanda dimag
 "he says," When Sourav was the captain and John Wright was the coach, he asked me, Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar to guard the slips
 ham sirf slip par hi practice karte or apni jimmedaariyaan acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Sachin first, i was on the second slip and Dravid was on the third slip, but Sachin was out of slip when Sachin's finger got hurt
 aise main rahul pehle, main duusare par hi bana rahaa or virendra sahvaag tisare slip par aa gaye
 We had a way, we used to watch the ball for 3 to 4 seconds and talk to each other the rest of the time
 isse lambey samay tak hamaari ekaagratha bane rahane main madad milti
 “the strong siege of slip has also contributed to the success achieved by India abroad
 javagal shrinath or jahir khan jaise tej gendbaaj (uske baad aar
 P
 singh, munaf patel, es
 Sreesanth can be named) and spinner Anil Kumble gets the support he needs
 unhone port of spain (2002) or jamaica (2006) jeeta, haidingle (2002) or nottingham (2007), adelaide (2003) or perth (2008), multan or rawalpindi (2004), johanisburg (2006) or darban (2010) ke alaava or kai match jite
 India's most successful captain, Ganguly, says, "if the fielding was not strong in the slip, we would not have won it
" hamaari tej gendbaaji ko unhone or prabhavi bana diya
 "experience with memory is also very important
 balle se hit karne ke baad gend itani tej gati se slip par aati he ki ball ke liye sahi ore se lapakane ke liye fielder ko gend kii disha kii sari baarikiyon kaa gyaan jaruri he
 As well as prudence and the ability to take immediate decisions
 mahaan gendbaajon kii safalataa kaa rahasy yah bhi he ki unhen fasrt slip par sahi khilaadi mil gaye
 In fact, in Test cricket, the bowler and slip fielder pair have an important role
 anil kumble-dravid, shen warn-mark wa, kapil-gavaskar, muralidharan-mahela jayavardhane kii jodisson ke bare main jaraa sochen
 It is also surprising that India's flaws are clearly visible in the slip, especially when better fielding has become the standard due to the demand for modern cricket
 kapil kehete hai, “pehle bhartiya khilaadi ausat fielder hote the lekin kaich acha lete the, ab sthiti iske ulat he
 He has become a good fielder with a large number of ODI and T20 matches but as far as i understand he does not practice slip catching as slip is rarely used in odis and T20 matches
 jaisaa ki apane samay main main or ajahar karte the—aaj ke slip fielderon ko practice ke dauraan kam-se-kam 100 kaich lene chahie
 Otherwise how would you take 20 wickets in a Test? ”based on what he has seen so far, Ganguly says the only way to improve is to identify three-four slip fielders and practice for a year
 unhen yah samaj aa janaa chahie ki unhen slip main khadey rahanaa he
 They have to practice in many ways
 gend ko har sambhav kone se parakhnaa he
 If India keeps slip catches, then the bowling will get more quick
 ”is bare main mahendra singh dhoni ko jarur sochna chahie
 After more than a decade, India is playing a series of first five Tests, then it will have to overcome this flaw to win the remaining matches
 bhartiya khilaadiyon ke world cap se thik pehle IPL main khilne se un par pad rahaa kaam kaa boj charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 But, Indian captain Virat Kohli has left it to his teammates to decide how many matches he has to play in this T20 tournament and how many not
 IPL 23 march se shuru ho jayega or iske samaapan ke turant baad bhartiya team ko england ravaanaa hona he, jahaan 30 may se world cap khelaa jayega
 The chairman of the selection committee MSK Prasad has already said that the franchise has been talked about the workload falling on the players, but Kohli said it is the player's job to manage his workload
 kohli ne kaha, 'hamane khilaadi ko puri budhimata se kaam lene or frenchiji prabandhan ko suchit karne kii jimmedaari di he
 They will be in contact with our physio Patrick Farhart

 lekin, iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki ham toornament main khilne ko lekar patibaddh nahin hai
 We have to be smart and make good decisions
 isaki jimmedaari khilaadi par hogi
 No one will be forced to take any decision
 'kohli ne haalanki iske saath hi kaha ki bhartiya team ke liye yah satr kaaphi vyast rahaa lekin team aatmavishvaas se bhari he or khilaadi IPL kaa lutf lene ke hakdaar hai
 Kohli said - still a place vacant for the World Cup final-11, he said, 'it is the effect of playing for a long time
 main iske bahaanaa nahin maan rahaa hum kyonki ek team ke rup main aap jo bhi match khelte ho usamen aap se jeet kii ummid kii jaati he
 When there is a long session you consider it
 yah kaaphi vyast satr rahaa
 The Indian captain said, 'we are happy with the kind of cricket we played

 It was good to see the confidence we moved forward with

 He was 56 years old and had been suffering from kidney and liver problems for a long time

 His health worsened due to jaundice and dengue
 is maheene kii shuruyaat main unhen varanasi se gudgaanv ke aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 The destination is far away, the path is difficult / alam, loneliness was the music of Begum Akhtar
 vahiin unke sangeet ko unki jindagi ke safar ne gadhaa tha
 So much that it is not possible to separate his life and music
 unka safar kishoravay main lakhanu main ek kothe se shuru hua tha, jise unki valida mushtari bai ne kaayam kiya tha jo khud bhi tawayph thim
 Akhtari achieved artist status on her own in a short span of time
 unki mehphilon main bahut izzatdaar jane-maane logon ko hi aane kii ijaajat thi
 a number of her 78 RMP recordings came under the banner of Megaphone and she became popular across North India
 bahut kam umr main hi ve apane kariyar ke kai rachanaatmak daur se gujarin
 It also includes theater performances in Calcutta in the 1920s
 unhone zyaadaatar 'vaimp' ke kirdaar adaa kiye ('kaale makhmali pashchimi paridhaan main or lambey kaale holder ke saath cigarette piti hui')
 He also performed in a few Vannatta films and sang songs (he is remembered most for a thumri he sang at Satyajit Rai's Jalsaghar)

 Trouble and sadness went through all these changes with her life constantly
 unke mushkil bachapan ke saath jo cheez shuru hui thi, vah baad ke saalon main aadat ban gai
 To the extent that she did not feel sorrow and sadness, she began to feel restless
 shaayad yahi vajah thi ki unhone sangeet kii abhivyakti ke apane chune hue fan ke liye jis shaayari ko chunaa, vah ghazal thi
 He gave a new voice to this fun, a musical that was his own and unique, adopted by many others in later years

 (writer is musician) november kii 16 taarikh ko jab vaanijya mantralay ne aktubar 2015 ke liye desh ke vyapaar ke aankadon ko pesh kiya to niryaatkon ko asal pareshaaniyon kaa abhas ho gaya
 Something like 2008-09, when the country's exports had declined for nine consecutive months due to the global recession
 is baar bhi aktubar main niryaat main ek saal pehle kii tulana main 18 fisadi giravat darj kii gai
 This was the eleventh consecutive month of decline in exports
 is baar bhi vaishvik arthvyavastha ke dhimepan ko isaki vajah bataaya ja saktaa he, par niryaatkon kii chintaa ke kai anya pahalu bhi hai
 One of these is the fall in prices of exports which in many cases is much higher
 bharat ke liye buniyadi taur par teen utpaada samooh pramukh hai—petro utpaada, heere or jevaraat tathaa krishi utpaada
 These three account for 45 percent of our total exports

 the trade deficit in the current financial year between April to October 77
 76 arab dollar hi rahaa he
 86 in the same period of the previous financial year
 26 arab dollar se kaaphi kam he
 Exports from India to Europe declined by 11 per cent, while exports to the US decreased by 3
 8 fisadi kii kami hui
 The main reason for this is the decline in oil products prices and textile exports
 natijatan bharat na keval varsh 2015-16 ke liye apane niryaat lakshya ko paane main naakaam rah saktaa he balki 8 fisadi se zyada kii vikaas dar ke lakshya se bhi chook saktaa he
 This also raises questions on the 'make in India' campaign launched to revive the manufacturing sector and underscore the weaknesses of a country whose industries are far behind in global competition
 bhartiya niryaat sanghathanon ke sangh ke mahanideshak ajay sahay kehete hai, ''sabase zyada chintaa kii baat yah he ki bharat kaa niryaat lagaataar kai maah tak 17 fisadi se bhi zyada neeche gira
 This decline was far sharper than in China
 china ne use paanch fisadi par thame rakhaa
 He says the reason for this is China's focus on value-added goods for export
 iske vipareet bharat kaa jor camodity par he jisamen kachche maal kii keemat main anischitata niryaat par pratikul asar daal sakati he
 The best example of how China has made a place in global trade through its export competition is the change in its trade equation with India
 donon deshon ke bich vyapaar ghaataa 2004-05 main 1
 48 billion in 2014-15 from $ 5 billion
 8 arab dollar tak pahunch gaya he
 Says Ashima Goyal, professor at Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, "the global slump in commodity prices is responsible for the current sluggishness
" isse maang main giravat aa gai
 But the fact is that the decline in our export growth is the highest in emerging markets
 ham rus, colombia or peru ke baad sabase kharaab haalat main hai
 "another important factor is that this is the third setback in the recent period
 goyal kaa kahana he, ''niryaatkon ko baar-baar jatke lag rahe hai
 "there was a rapid recovery after the global recession, but the 2011 euro debt crisis also affected our exports
" uske baad phir niryaat sthalon main vividhta se recovery hui
 Now this current crisis is before us
 sahay kaa kahana he ki is dar se bharat 2015-16 ke liye apane 325 arab dollar ke niryaat lakshya se kaaphi peeche rah jayega kyonki pichley saat maah main sirf 155 arab dollar hi arjeet hue hai
 Mehul Chaksi, managing director of the Gitanjali Group, says the current sluggishness can last for a year
 ve kehete hai, ''bhu-rajnatik vajahon se heere or jevaraat kaa gaiyr-america bazaar jo is kshetra kaa kareeb 60 fisadi he, 25 fisadi tak gira he, jabaki america bazaar main vruddhi mahaj do se teen fisadi hi rahi he
 The government should further reduce restrictions on gold imports to improve the supply of raw materials

 Exporters want to address the issue of debt costs on a war footing as interest rates are close to 13 to 14 per cent
 isaki tulana main dakshin-purv asia main byaaj daren 5 se 6 fisadi ke aasapaas hi hai
 The second issue is high transaction costs
 yah sarkari prakriyaaon se nibatane kii laagat he
 In this, companies spend between 15 and 25 billion dollars, while the total exports are around 300 billion dollars
 sahay kehete hai, ''sarkarity connactivity se prakriyaaon ko saral bana len-dein kii is laagat ko 50 fisadi bhi kam kar detii he to khaasaa laabh hoga''kuch logon kaa kahana he ki is samasya se nibatane ke liye udhyamiyon ko poshit karnaa hoga or pratispardhaa main sudhaar karnaa hoga
 Professor Biswajit Dhar of Jawaharlal Nehru University says that some areas like textiles and chemicals have seen improvement and need to be pursued
 mashin upkaran or audyogic mashinari kshetron ne bhi niryaat main susti se khud ko bachaae rakhaa he
 He says, "the government should help the better performing sectors
" ''sarkaar kaa kahana he ki vah niryaat ko badhaane ke liye kadam uthaa rahi he
 Union Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman says, "exports are declining in terms of value
" ham aise kadam uthaane kii koshish kar rahe hai jinase hamaara niryaat pratispardhi ho sake
 He believes that the recent move to give 3 per cent interest subsidy to exporters will be helpful
 ek anya baat yah kahi ja rahi he ki bharat ne dakshin asia mukt vyapaar samjhaute samet duusare deshon ke saath jo haalia vyapaar samjhaute kiye hai, unke vaanchit nattejey nahin nikle hai
 "new agreements will not be of any benefit without removing domestic barriers," says Goyal
 '' udhaaharan ke taur par bharat kii container-purv vyapaar laagat 2014 main purvi asia kii ausat laagat ke dogune se bhi zyada thi
 In the short term, India needs more focus on the US and Europe, where there is little improvement, and in the long run, the need to diversify its trade, reduce trade costs and increase facilities for exporters
 haalanki rupee main avamulyan hua he par baaki deshon kii mudraon main usase zyada avamulyan hua he
 Between April and September this year, the rupee depreciated by about 5 per cent to 65 against the dollar
 74 tak pahunch gaya
 In August, China took several steps to devalue its currency and let the yuan fall against the dollar to help exporters
 isse duniya main maudrik jang chhidaae ke bhi sanket najar aane lage
 "the rupee should remain competitive, but high devaluation can create instability and increase the cost of importers," says Goyal
 mudra main zyada utaar-chadhaav niryaatkon ko nuksaan hi pahunchaata he
 "india cannot afford to ignore the current decline in exports if it has to join a large list of enthusiastic exports and regain double digit growth through 'make in India'

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has directly attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to which the Bharatiya Janata Party has also responded in a sharp tone
 BJP kii ore se twit kiya gaya he ki aaj china UNSC kaa hissaa hi nahin hota agar aapke great grandfadar china ko use ye seat tohfe main naa dete
 BJP has tweeted that India is still suffering from the mistakes made by your family
 aap is baat ko nishchit samajhen ki bharat aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang jeet kar hi rahegaa
 Leave all this to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as long as you keep secretly meeting Chinese counterparts
 China wouldn't be in UNSC had your great grandfather not 'gifted' it to them at India’s cost
 India is undoing all mistakes of your family
 Be assured that India will win the fight against terror
 Leave it to PM Modi while you keep cosying up with the Chinese envoys secretly

 If steps are taken then Prime Minister Narendra Modi takes silence
 rahul gandhi ne likhaa ki pradhanmantri modi ne jinping ke saath gujarat main jhula jhula, dilli main gale mili or china main jaakar unke saamne sir jhukaa diya
 Before Rahul Gandhi, other Congress spokespersons are also attacking Modi government directly

 Apart from the expectation of the countrymen and the steps taken by the government on the issues that have arisen after demonetisation, Budget 2017 will witness two major changes - 1
 rail bajet ab aam bajet main hi pesh kiya jayega

 5 lakh se zyada kii inakam par 20 fisadi or 10 lakh rupee se adhik kamai karne waalon ke liye 30 fisadi he
 On the other hand, the government is expected to announce several schemes in the budget 2017 for the welfare of the poor and to woo the poor
 jisase saamaajik kharch vyay main baari oochaal dekha jayega
 Not only this, the Modi government, which promotes digital payments after demonetisation, can also declare tax exemption for those who use e-payment
 china bharat ko gherne ke liye ek saath kai yojanaon par kaam kar rahaa he
 On one hand, Xi Jinping, once again elected President of China, says that the focus of his army should be on winning the war
 vahiin bharat seemaa par rah rahe tibeti basti se kaha ki ‘chini bhubhag kii raksha ke liye jaden jamaa kar rakhen’
 That is, China is trying to beat it not only by big moves but also by running small tricks against India
 aise main chini raajnneeti main lagaataar majboot hote shi jinping china ko bharat ke liye bada khatra bana sakate hai
 At the same time, China has prepared a new plan for Brahmaputra

 There is a plan to divert Brahmaputra water from Tibet to Jinjiang through this tunnel

 ’ yani china kaa plan charavaahon ko apana naagarik kahkar maanavadhikaar kaa hawala dekar us seemaa par daawa karte rahane kaa he
 With this message, China has encouraged a family of shepherds to settle in the border area, protect the Chinese territory and expand the settlement there
 lunje bharat ke arunachal pradesh ke paas he, jis par china apana daawa karata he or ise dakshini tibet kahata he
 Not only this, China also wants to frighten India from the growing forces of the army
 yahi vajah he ki ek baar phirachin ke raashtrapatichune gaye shi jinping ne apane pehle hi baithak main sena par jor diya
 Through this meeting, Xi Jinping, along with his army, sent a message to the world about how fast he is moving towards becoming a world class military power
 shi jinping ne us baithak main kaha tha ki hamen is baat par jor dena chahie ki 2050 tak ham kis tarah world class military taiyaar kar saken
 This was Xi's first meeting after becoming president again
 baithak main shi khud bhi military dress pahan kar aae the
 In the meeting, he said that we should build an army that would listen to the command of CPC and be able to win the war

 BJP alleges that Kuldeep was involved in the fake encounter case against the UPA government under the leadership of Congress
 unke chote bhai pradeep sharma kaa kahana he ki unhen kuldeep ke kaaran nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Singhal, once close to Modi, was accused of a fake encounter in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan case
 unhen farvari 2013 main giraftaar kiya gaya tha lekin june main jamaanat de di gai thi
 Pradeep, sitting in a government bungalow in the capital, considers himself a character in the Ramayana of Kali Yuga

 My appeal is pending with the Department of Personnel and Training (dopt) at the center
 ’’lekin pradeep jise sachaai kii ladaai bataate hai, vah rajnatik bhi he
 He has six cases of corruption against him, mostly between 2005 and 2007, including the illegal allocation of land in Kutch and Bhavnagar and the undervaluation of prices
 inamen se do maamle welspan or shaw pips ko gaiyr-kanoonee tareeke se jameen aavantit karne se sambandhit hai
 These cases were registered against him between 2009 and 2012

 He has appealed to the Supreme Court to dismiss the cases against him, on which the verdict is yet to come

 Pradeep says the tapes vindicate his point

 He always felt insecure in this matter
 tepon ne ise sabit kar diya he
 Six months before the first case was filed against me, he had decided to put me in jail, as the conversation between Singhal and Amit Shah shows
 ’’ unka yah bhi kahana he ki bade bhai ke kaaran bhi unhen nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 a case is also going on against Kuldeep, which is related to his appointment to the post of SP in Kutch in 1984

 The case was dismissed by the Gujarat High Court, but now the case is going on in the Supreme Court

 Pradeep Sharma asks, "had there been any merit in the complaints, could he have got an advisory position in the Ministry of Home Affairs
 ’’ unka kahana he ki unke bhai ko isliye nishaanaa banaaya gaya kyonki unhone farji muthbhed karne vaale kuch police afasaron ke khilaaf karrwai kii thi
 There was a time when the Sharma brothers had full confidence in Modi and his confidant Amit Shah

 The late N

 en
 Sharma's sons - Kuldeep and Pradeep - enjoyed tremendous status because of their close proximity to power

 Shah took charge of the Ministry of Home Affairs in December 2002
 yah sambandh ek-duusare kii prashansa par aadhaarit tha
 Kuldeep then publicly said about Shah, "I have not yet seen a more intelligent leader in my life (than Shah)
" ’’udhar, shah bhi kuldeep ke dhakadpan or ‘‘vilakshan vichaaron’’ se prabhavit the
 The most commendable work done by Kuldeep under Shah was to prepare a manual with detailed information about terrorist organizations, take precautions and take action on behalf of the government
 kuldeep sharma kii dabang style ke kaaran police vibhaag main bahut-se log pareshaan the
 Shah is also believed to have ignored Modi's advice
 modi ne is police adhikari ke ‘‘apratyaashit’’ ravaie ke bare main shah ko aagaah kiya tha
 The tension between Kuldeep and Shah started when Kuldeep started taking action against a small BJP worker close to Shah in a case
 yah tanaav us vakt apane charam par pahunch gaya jab kuldeep ne 2005 ke ant main modi ko patr likhakar shah par aarope lagaaya ki ve 1,200 karod ru

 Kuldeep believed that Shah wanted to discredit him through this
 sutron kaa kahana he ki is ghatana ke baad ve modi ko asthir karne waalon ke saath ho gaye
 On the other hand, despite the distance between the elder brother and Shah, Pradeep had Modi's trust
 mana jaataa he ki mukhyamantri ne is salaah kii andekhi kar di thi ki pradeep apane bade bhai ke saath mili hue hai
 Modi continued to give him good postings

 At that time Pradeep Sharma, the municipal commissioner of Bhavnagar, began to be monitored
 pradeep kehete hai, ‘‘yah kisi se chupa nahin he ki gujarat main phone tap karnaa aam baat he
 When Pradeep got the news from his sources that he would definitely be arrested, he persuaded the elder brother to propose a settlement to Modi and Shah through some senior IAS officers, but Their effort went in vain
 pradeep sharma ko janvari 2010 main bhavnagar main unke ghar se giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Meanwhile, Kuldeep took the path of law for his promotion, as he was denied by the Gujarat government
 unhone kendriya prashasnic tribunel (cat) ke jariye apni vaarshik gopneey report ko bhi thik karakar ‘‘bahut acha’’ se ‘‘shandaar’’ kara liya, jaisaa ki unke puure kariyar main rahaa he
 After retiring from the post of Director General of Bureau of Police Research and Development on deputation to the Center in December 2012, he got the current appointment of Advisor in the Ministry of Home Affairs in Delhi
 ab pradeep ke liye singhl ke audio tepe ummid kii kiran banakar aae hai
 Singhal was released on bail in June as the CBI could not file a charge sheet against him within the stipulated period of 90 days, which is believed to have reached an agreement between him and the agency at the behest of the UPA government 
 ishrat jahaan maamle main farvari main sibiai ne singhl ko mukhya abhiyukt banaakar giraftaar kiya tha
 Now questions are being raised about a possible plan by the UPA government to use these angry officers to embarrass Modi
 singhl aakhir shah ke saath hone vaali apni sari baatcheet ko kyon record kar rahe the? kathith taur par shah ne unase mahila architect kii jasusi karne ko kaha tha
 Sources close to Singhal say that there was a deep atmosphere of mistrust in the state, so he had installed a software in his phone that automatically taped all the conversations
 iske saath hi gujarat sarkaar se unka bharosa tab uth gaya tha
 When he and some other accused police officers got no help from the state government in fake encounter cases

 apane aakhri bayaan main unhone vistaar se bataaya ki kis tarah amit shah ne unase mahila kii jasusi karne ke liye kaha tha
 He also gave one of the two pen drives to CBI which involved interaction with various important people including Amit Shah between 4 August 2008 and 10 September 2009
 pehle ke do bayanon main singhl ne khulaasa kiya ki unhone shah ke kehane par aise bahut se kaam kiye jo kanoon ke khilaaf the
 He says he met two important witnesses in the Sohrabuddin case — Dashrath Patel and Ramanbhai Patel, both builders — to prepare him to turn his back on the testimony
 in donon bilderon ko raji karne ke liye singhl ko bada pralobhan diya gaya
 He says that BJP leader Bhupendra Singh Chudasama told him on behalf of Modi that if he convinces both the builders, the Chief Minister can save him

 Singhal was promoted to IPS in 2007 after his leading role in the encounter
 yahi nahin, uske baad bhi unhen rajya main acchhee niyuktiyaan milti raheen
 Singhal refused to talk to India Today
 vanjaaraa ab bhi jail main band hai, jabaki singhl kathith rup se sibiai kaa sahyog karne kii evaj main jamaanat paane main kaamyaab ho gaye hai
 Vanzara too took a rebellious post when he sent his resignation this year accusing the Modi government of abandoning him and other police officers
 unhone apane ‘‘bhagwaan’’ modi par yah aarope bhi lagaaya tha ki ve ‘‘dusht’’ shah ke prabhaav main aa gaye hai
 Pradeep Sharma denies that he is trying to organize angry officials against Modi
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘modi ke paas unhen sangathit hone se rokane ke apane tareeke’’ hai
 Pradeep Sharma describes his fight in a very effective way, "vanzara is calm now

 mangalvaar ko rajasthan main narendra modi kii sabha he or is sabha main aane vaale muslim samudaay ke logon ko topi pahanakar sabha main aane ko kaha gaya he
 Reactions have now started coming from the Muslim community about this
 lakhanu sthit firangi mahali ke sunni guru khalid raashid kaa kahana he ki 2002 main jo gujarat main hua, usase bharat hi nahin puri duniya waakif he
 Despite that, no action was taken against those who were guilty there
 narendra modi ne abhi tak uski jimmedaari nahin lee or naa hi uske liye koi maafee nahin maangi
 Despite all this, it is regrettable if some Muslims attend their rally
 jis tarah se usamen dress code sirf musalamaanon ke liye lagu kiya gaya he, or chunaav ke samay musalamaanon kii jo numaaish kerani he to ham samajhate hai ki musalamaanon ko is harakat or sajeesh ko samajhnaa chaiye or usase dur rahanaa chaiye
 At the same time, Shia Guru Kalbejvad has said that this is all a drama, even in the election that was held earlier, some people supported the BJP
 yahaan par bhi aaye the lekin janata par koi asar nahin hua
 The public knows what the bjp's strategy is
 wo anti muslim policy do-chaar log agar stage par saamne aa gayi to usase koi fark nahin padane vaala
 If two or four or 10 people are with Modi or BJP, it does not mean that Muslims are with Modi
 do-chaar logon ko paise dekar kahin bhi shaamil kiya ja saktaa he, koi bhi party shaamil kar sakati he
 See how many other people of the SP are involved in the Muslim League, that is a drama to show that Muslims are with us
 agar musalmaan aapke saath to dresscode kii zarurat hi nahin he, iskaa matlab he ki yah keval drama he or chand logon ko kharida gaya he

 6 arab dollar kii madad dene kaa vaada kiya gaya tha, jisamen guadar port ke vistaar ke liye 62
 $ 2 million in aid was also included
 vistaar kii is yojana ke tahat china-pakistan iconomic coridor (sipiisi) ko jingjiyang ke saath guadar se jodpha mukhya tha
 In a recent report from Pakistan, the planned investment is more than $ 60 billion
 donon ke bich sambandhon ko bhale hi bahut alankarik banaakar pesh kiya jaataa ho, lekin jamini hakeekat isse alag he
 Economic and trade relations between Pakistan and China are not as good as they are supposed to be
 china uskaa sabase bada vyapaarik saajheedaar he, uske saath bhi pakistan kaa haal ke varshon main vaarshik vyapaar 12 se 15 arab dollar ke bich, vah bhi mukhya rup se china kii ore jhukaa rahaa he
 The sino-pakistan Free Trade Agreement (FTA), signed in 2007, is viewed by Pakistan's business as destructive to its industry
 2013 main pakistan ke sabase bade vyapaarik sanghathan pakistan bijness council kii ore se kiye gaye ek adhyayan main paaya gaya ki pat ke baad pakistan ko kul niryaat main china kaa hissaa 10 pratishat se neeche bana rahaa he, jabaki china aayaat ke maamle main doosraa sabase bada strot ban gaya, jo 25 pratishat se thodaa zyada he
 This excludes import of petroleum products
 usne paaya ki china ne pakistan ke liye tarriff main koi vishesh chhot nahin di he
 According to Pakistani experts specializing in China's investment in his book The China Pakistan Axis, Andrew Small described China's investment in 2013 as $ 5-7 billion
 china kii ore se mukhya rup se karj ke taur par sahaayta ke vaade kaa bahut kam pratishat paisa hi desh main aayaa he
 Reason: The ability to use that money in Pakistan is very low and the security situation is very frightening
 ek aise ilaake main jahaan sadak sampark banane kii sakht jarurat rahi he, sipiisi ek swaagatyogy kadam ho saktaa tha, lekin yah galiyara bhartiya ilaake se hokar guzar rahaa he, jis par pakistan ne avaidh rup se kabja kar rakhaa he
 Taking India along, Pakistan can act as a bridge connecting Central and West Asia on one side and Southeast Asia and beyond on the other
 lekin pakistan sipiisi ke prati itnaa utsahit he ki vah purv or pashchim ke bich ek sambhavit root kii andekhi kar rahaa he
 It is also neglecting to have a beneficial transit route through its country to the east-west as well as a connectivity route between the SAARC countries
 1960 or '70 ke dashak main banaae karakoram rajmarg ke samay hi sipiisi ke beej pad gaye the
 The construction of the first phase of Gwadar Port, which was completed in 2006 with the help of China, was an important step
 par suraksha ke halaat badtar hone ke kaaran china ne use aage nahin badhaayaa
 a 40-year operating contract was awarded to the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA)
 baharhaal, desh ke baaki hisson ke saath kharaab sampark ke kaaran yah port shuru nahin ho paaya
 One reason for this was that the Pakistan Navy did not want to give the land adjacent to the port to the PSA
 farvari 2013 main pakistan sarkaar ne port ke sanchaalan kaa kaam china oversij port holding company limited ko saunp diya
 Then what happened is that China changed its mind despite continuing dangerous security situation
 galiyare ke aarthik phaaydon kii baat bahut badha-chadhaakar pesh kii ja rahi he
 Passing through the 15,000-foot Khunjrab Pass, oil and gas pipelines to China via Central Asia are of little use
 sipiisi kaa kuch aarthik matlab ho saktaa he kyonki yah galiyara ranneetik rup se uske liye phydemand ho saktaa he or malakka jaldamru madhya ke kinare se nikalate hue bypass kaa kaam kar saktaa he
 Gwadar can also prove beneficial for the Chinese Navy at the mouth of the Persian Gulf
 saath hi pakistan ko bhi nausena ke ek adde ke taur par iskaa phayda mil saktaa he, jo karachi ke mukaable bhartiya tat se zyada dur hoga
 The CPEC corridor passing through Pakistan will also not be very uninterrupted
 isamen suraksha ke khataron ke saath-saath chote rajyon main is baat ko lekar andeh he ki sipiisi ke purvi hisse, jo pakistan ke punjab se hokar gujarata he, ko zyada or khaybar-pakhtoonkhwaa tathaa baluchistan se hokar guzarane vaale hisse ko kam mahatv diya ja rahaa he
 Another concern is that the construction of this corridor may adversely affect the country's economy in the medium and long term
 aktubar, 2016 main karachi main pakistan bijness and iconomic sammelan main sipiisi par bolte hue pakistan bijness council ke siio ehsaan ali malik ne kaha tha, ''uphaar main milane vaala ghoda, jiske bheetar jhaankne se ham hichak rahe hai, kahin dhokhaa dene vaala ghoda (trogen horse) na sabit ho jaae
 "he expressed concern about the business area being built in Karachi on the side of the corridor and doubted whether it would bring in so much foreign currency that we would be able to meet the CPEC debt? The chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Planning and Development, said The construction of the corridor demanded clarity regarding the protection of the interests of the country
 unhone kaha, ''china hamaara bhai he
 But business has its place
 "china ne pakistan ke sainya audyogic parisar ko banane main bahut bada yogadan diya he or vah pakistan ke liye hathiyaaron kii aapurti karne vaala sabase bada desh ban gaya he
 Pakistan's missile program has benefited greatly from China's assistance in the supply of M-11 and M-9 missiles and developing other delivery systems in the 1990s
 sarvavidit he ki pakistan ne china se takneekee sahyog milane ke kaaran 1998 main atom bam ke pareekshan se bahut pehle atomi kshamta hasil kar lee thi
 China has built four other reactors — two in Chashma and two near Karachi — after the Chashma 1 and Chashma 2 reactors (which were protected by the "grandfather clause" when China joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 2004)
 is tarah china-pakistan kii dosti hamaari taatkaalik chintaaon se kahin vyapak he—enesji main bharat ke shaamil hone kii koshish kaa china kii ore se virodh or yuanessi prastaav 1267 ke tahat pratibandhit vyaktiyon kii suchi main jaish-e-mohammad ke mukhiya masood ajahar ko shaamil karnaa
 But this close friendship between the two countries has also failed to curb terrorism and religious extremism from Pakistan in China's troubled province of Jingjiang
 east turkistan islamic movement (itiiem) ke uigur aatankwaadiyon ke liye kuch varshon se pakistan kaa uttar-pashchim kaa arajak ilaaka ek panaahagaah ban gaya he
 Attacks on Chinese citizens have increased in Pakistan
 pakistan ko america se jo aarthik sahaayta milti he, china ne uskaa vikalp banane kaa koi iraadaa nahin dikhaaya he
 China's investments in Pakistan have been mainly in the form of long-term easy loans
 china vahaan do virodhabhasi uddeshyon par aage badaae kii koshish kar rahaa haih uskaa istemaal ranneetik partner or pargaman root ke taur par karnaa or uske jariye bharat ko kaabo main rakhana chahta he
 But China should take a lesson from America's experiences
 sainya sahaayta lene ke baad jaruri nahin ki pakistan apane sangrakshak ke agenda par kaam kare
 He considers the support he receives from his patron as a license to play hostility against India, in which he does not even take into account the red line drawn by the patron, that is, to exercise restraint
 bharat ke prati had darje kii dushmani nibhaane main use apni aarthik kshamtaaon kaa bhi dhyaan nahin rahata
 It is spending more than its capacity on its military, is trying to gain strategic strength in Afghanistan, and is nurturing organizations like lashkar-e-taiba, which are spreading religious extremism in Pakistan
 bharat ke khilaaf uske shatrutapurna ravaiye main darasal uski asthirataa ke beej nihit hai
 If his mentor promotes this attitude, he will eventually find an unstable partner who can neither become a trusted strategic partner nor provide a safe transit route
 ham china-pakistan kii badhati santhganth kii andekhi nahin kar sakate
 We need to make a long-term policy, which should cover the weaknesses of this friendship of the two

 Air India is awaiting government investment of Rs 1,200 crore
 iske alaava vimaanan company ko viviipi udaanon kaa sanchaalan ke bakaae ke taur par bhi 530 karod rupee milane vaale hai
 The airline currently has a total debt of about Rs 40 crore, which it took to buy new aircraft and for operational work
 bhartiya janata party kii yashodhara raaje sindhiya ne kaha ki unhen air india ke kuch karmchaariyon ne bataaya he ki unhone kai maheenon se apane karj kii masik kist tak jamaa nahin kii he
 He asked Minister Vayalar Ravi that if you would take a loan for a car or a house, would the banks wait for their salary for the monthly installment? Air India pilots flying domestic aircraft get a salary of four lakh rupees per month, 80% of which is paid on performance basis

 The group is headed by Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee
 ravi ne kaha tha ki mantriyon kaa samooh main vimaanan company main nivesh ke liye sahmati ban gai thi
 The airline wants a total investment of Rs 17,000 crore, of which an investment of Rs five thousand crore is wanted only this year
 sarkaar ne pichley do saalon main vimaanan company main chaar hajaar karod rupee kaa nivesh kiya he
 Apart from this, in the budget of the current business year, an investment of two thousand crore rupees was promised in the airline
 pradhanmantri ne mantriyon ke samooh se jald-se-jald apni salaah dene ke liye kaha tha

 sansad main vidheyak ke paas hone ke baad in coloniyon main rahane waalon ko kareeb 40 lakh logon ko malikana haq mil jayega
 Among these colonies is the middle and lower class section of Delhi, which had been waiting for these colonies to be regularized for many years
 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi aagaamee chunaav main apane is faisle ko janata ke bich rakhegi or vot maangegi
 Modi had met the people living in illegal colonies, before this, PM Narendra Modi on Friday met RWA office holders as well as people living in irregular colonies at his residence
 is mulaakaat ke dauraan piem modi ne kaha tha ki aap lambey samay se ek anischitata ke maahaul main rahe
 Many governments worked in this direction, but half-heartedly
 hamaari sarkaar 2014 main ai, tab se ham dilli main rahane vaale logon kii mushkil kaa hal nikaalane ke liye tareeke khoj rahe the
 Credit spree in BJP and AAP government had announced regularization of 1797 illegal colonies a few months back
 is dauraan siem arvind kejariwal ne kaha tha, 'ham lambey samay se isaki ladaai lard rahe the
 Thank the Central Government for this decision
 is prastaav ko hamane 2015 main bheja tha or uske baad se dilli sarkaar lagaataar centre sarkaar ke sampark main thi
 Kejriwal says that on 24 July 2019, he also gave his suggestions on its draft
 din main AAP kaa pradarshan, shaam ko cabinet kii muharvahin, aap netaa sanjay singh ne kaha tha, 'sarkaar ne do november, 2015 ko anaadhikrut coloniyon ko niyamit karne kaa cabinet kaa faisla centre kii bhaajapa sarkaar ko bheja tha
 For four years, the BJP, who has been silent, will have confidence only when they have a registry in their hands
 bhaajapa ko isapar adhyadesh paas karnaa chahie
 For the ordinance, the Aam Aadmi Party protested outside Parliament on Wednesday and demanded the government to bring the bill
 shaam ko modi cabinet ne vidheyak ko manjuuri de di
 People living in illegal colonies will get these benefits
 The cabinet approved the bill to regulate illegal colonies
 ab sansad main bill paas hone ke baad coloniyon main rahane vaale logon ko unki jameen kaa malikana haq milegaa
 With this, the government approved the proposal to withdraw all cases under Section 81 of the Delhi Land Reform Act
 saath hi 79 gaanvon ke shaharikaran ko bhi green signal de diya gaya
 All of you watch the video of the press conference of the Election Commission of 18 April
 yah video ayog ke patan kaa dastauez (document of decline) he
 At the time when the sun of the Commission was seen sinking, the rings of emeralds and rubies were shining in the fingers of a commissioner's hand
 daftar main baitha achaanak news agency ke zarie aa rahe live feed ko dekhne laga tha
 Just look at the answers of the commissioners and their eyes in response to two questions
 pradhanmantri ke helicopter kii talaashi or balakot ke naam par vot maangane par kya karrwai hui he, inke jawaab ko suniye, aapako saaf ho jayega ki chunaav ayog kaa surya dhundhala ho gaya he
 Both the rings of a commissioner equipped with emeralds and rubies started knocking in the eyes, then someone started calling when they wear green emerald and light red ruby
 jawaab mila ki buddhi or surya kamazor ho to use prabal karne ke liye pahante hai
 i got into thinking that this person has become commissioner by the procedures of the constitution or by the combination of astrology
 agar iske kariyar main sirf jyotish ke sanyog kaa yogadan he to ham ummid kyon kar rahe hai ki ayukta ji sanvaidhanik maryaadaaon ke liye itihaas main apana naam darj karana chaahate hai
 The Commission has not yet taken any action on the statement of Prime Minister Modi given at the election rally in Latur, Maharashtra on 9 April
 us raily main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki pehali baar vot karne vaale matadaata kya aapnaa vot pulavama ke shaheedon or balakot airstrike main shaamil vir javaanon ko samarpit nahin kar sakate
 The commission could not act on this statement yet
 maharashtra ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari se jawaab maanga gaya tha
 When the reporters asked what action was taken on it, the answer was that only one paragraph of the Prime Minister's speech had come
 puure bhaashan kii pramanik copy maangi gai thi jo aa gai he
 He is being investigated
 skool kii aadaten jivan bhar nahin chhootati hai
 The answer to the homework copy missed out on not doing homework was reflected in the reply of the Election Commissioner
 jis vakt ayukta gina rahe the ki itane lakh shikayaton kaa nipataara kar diya gaya he, usee vakt is baat kaa jawaab nahin de paa rahe the ki pradhanmantri ke bhaashan par ection lene main 9 din kyon lage
 While the commission has warned Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on the use of the army
 zaahir he sena kaa istamaal vaidhanik nahin he to phir pradhanmantri ke maamle main kya ayog ke panna pukhraj pahanane vaale ayuktaon ko dar lag rahaa he? agar itnaa hi dar lag rahaa he to ve moonga or neelam bhi pahan len or apane pad se istipha de den
 So much must be remembered that history turns pages
 ve na sirf itihaas balki apane vartmaan se mukhaatib hai
 He is famous to his friends and family
 chunaav ayog ne odisha ke abzarwar mohammad mohsin ko nilambit kar diya
 There is no existence of the rules that the commission suspended citing the search of Prime Minister Modi's chopper
 ayog chunaav duty par tainaat afasaron ko jo guideline detaa he usee ko uthaakar pard le or bataa de ki kya usamen kahin likhaa he ki espiji surakshit vyakti ke helicopter kii jaanch nahin kerani he
 Please tell which page is written on it
 zaahir he nahin likhaa he
 When the question arose, the Commission should have come to the press conference with all the things but neither could give a direct answer to whose action was taken on the complaint nor under which rule it was suspended Mohammad Mohsin
 kabhi kaha field afasar kabhi kaha dio kabhi kaha siio, kabhi kaha magistrate
 You can also watch the video that i have shown in prime time, you will see the face of the fall of the Election Commission
 10 april 2014 ke aadesh kaa hawala diya ja rahaa he
 You should also read this order
 isamen yah to likhaa he ki espiji surakshit vyakti sarkari vaahanon kaa istamaal nahin kar saktaa he magar pradhanmantri va anya raajnneetik shakhsiyaton ko chhot he ki ve sarkari vaahanon kaa istamaal kar sakate hai
 Because they are at risk from terrorist and extremist activities and require high level of protection
 jinaki suraksha sansad yaa vidhansabha ke banaae sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon se hoti he
 But nowhere in this order is it written that the election officer cannot search his helicopter
 yah zarur likhaa he ki “agar kabhi is baat ko lekar zaraa bhi andeh ho ki espiji act yaa anya vishesh praavdhaanon ke tahat athurity ne suraksha kaa moolyankan badha chadha kar is tarah se kiya he ki un vaahanon se kisi party yaa ummidavaar ke paksh main chunavi hiton ko prabhavit kiya ja sake to ayog is maamle ko sambandhit sarkaar kii nazar main laaegaa taaki uchit kadam uthaaya ja sake
 That means the chopper can be searched only then you will be able to see if the helicopter is being used to influence the election
 zaahir he mohammad mohsin ne thik kaam kiya tha
 Manmohan Singh's vehicle was also searched while being Prime Minister
 yahi nahin jab patrakaron ne poocha ki kis aadesh ke tahat suspend kiya gaya he unki copy chahie to ayukta ji jawaab de rahe the ki ham check karenge
 We will find out
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ek afasar jaanch kar rahaa he to kya jaanch se pehle mohammad mohsin ko nilambit karnaa chahie tha?14 july 1999 kaa ek or aadesh he
 The Election Commission has not written anywhere that any government aircraft or helicopter has been exempted from the search
 10 april 2014 ke aadesh main bhi yah baat nahin he ki pradhanmantri ke helicopter kii talaashi nahin lee ja sakati
 The book given to the officers on election duty is also not written in it
 chunaav ayog ne apane bachaav main 22 march 2019 ke aadesh kaa hawala diya he jise hamaare sahyogi arvind gunashekhar ne padhaa he or apni report main dikhaaya bhi he
 This order will not investigate those at the commercial airport who are exempted due to SPG security
 magar pradhanmantri ke helicopter kii talaashi odisha ke sambalpur main hui jahaan koi airport hi nahin he
 The Election Commission is losing its confidence every day due to the Prime Minister
 rajyapal kalyaan singh ke kilaaf karrwai kii sifaarish raashtrapati ko bhej kar nishcint ho gaya he
 The President has also not taken any action yet
 2019 ke chunaav main sansthaaon kii har manzil dhahati nazar aa rahi he
 If the public does not see, should astrology be asked by the people that they should wear all kinds of gems to the officers of the Commission so that they can do their constitutional work
 kya koi aisi anguthi he jise pahan kar chunaav ayukta kii ungliyaan sundar bhi lagen or ve nirbhay or nishpaksh hokar sanvaidhanik kaam kar saken
 If this cannot be done then do another job
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye alag se chunaav ayog khol dijie jiskaa daftar unke mobile phone main ho

 Freedom of expression is a fundamental right
 isliye ham rajya sarkaron se yah bhi aagrah kar rahe hai ki iti adhinium ke praavdhaanon ke istemaal ke bare main kriyanvayan agenciyon ko shikshit kiya jaae
 At this, BJP member Jayaprakash Narayan Singh asked Sibal if action would be taken against Arvind Kejriwal and his team on social networking sites against the politicians and Parliament
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya dand samhita (ipisi) ke tahat yadi koi vyakti kisi ke khilaaf koi galat aarope lagaataa he to uske khilaaf manahani kaa maamla daayar kiya ja saktaa he lekin iti adhinium kaa istemaal loktantr ke saath khilwaad hoga, kyonki sabhi ko abhivyakti kii aazaadee mili hui he

 On January 23, 2018, the Supreme Court told Hadiya that he cannot question the right of a woman to choose a husband
 lekin pehle hamen adaalat main anginat logon ke us bhayankar huddang ko jhelana padaa
 When he says that Hadiya suffers from 'stockholm Syndrome' (a mood where hostage hijackers tend to think of themselves as well-wishers) or has the right to challenge one's marriage to things like khap, their mood was such As if they are considering their hooding as a small contribution to this noble endeavor

 This political thinking gets manure and water from the self-styled leaders who are far away from the rules and laws to the extent of the drunkenness
 is prakaar hamaare netaa pehle se hi kaam ke boj tale dabi hamaari adaalaton kii kaarywahi main or adchane daalate hai
 The courts have to put in extra effort to uphold constitutional ideals, while the political section, which is constrained by a social reality, makes no effort to reform

 The 18th-century English thinker Edmund Burke warned Bristol voters, "your public representative owes you, not just his enterprise, but also his decisions

 "such inherited thinking is lost somewhere in our political environment where leaders riding the wave of popularity are eager to fall to any extent to serve their political interests
" yah hamaare chune hue janpratinidhiyon kii apane kaam ko bakhubi anjaam na de paane kii naakaami kaa subut he ki supreme court ko aise ghise-pite bayaan dene ko vivash hona pad rahaa he
 No member of the government is willing to tell us what they are doing on the violence that is happening under the guise of identity politics
 koi nahin bataa rahaa ki jis vibhaajankaree raajnneeti ke liye samvidhan main koi sthaan nahin uski kshatipurti kaise hogi
 Everybody talks a lot on the subject like stock market and economic powers, but people are sitting silent even after seeing clear signs of a fast growing dangerous disease to engulf the society

 On the India Today Conclave 2019 platform, BJP leader and minister in Assam government Hemant Biswa Sharma strongly supported the Citizenship Amendment Bill with his arguments
 vahiin, AIMIM ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi ne iskaa virodh kiya
 Owaisi said that if you want to send Hindus or Muslims, then send all the refugees back to their country
 india today conklev main rajdeep saradesai ke saare sawaalon kaa asaduddin ovaisi ne bebaaki se jawaab diya
 During this, he said that India is a democratic and secular country, where there is a law for all
 ovaisi ne hemanth biswa sharma se sawaal karte hue poocha ki kya aapane samvidhan kii shapath lee he
 When he said yes, Owaisi said that according to Article 14 of the Constitution, no religion can be discriminated against
 hindu, isai, buddha, sikh ko vaat nahin karte hai keval muslim sharnaarthiyon ko waapas bhejne kii baat karte hai
 How can one distinguish Bengali Muslim and Bengali Hindu? aisa karnaa asanvaidhanik he
 Owaisi said, 'I cannot believe that all Muslims should be sent out'
 On this Hemant Bishwa Sharma said that it is impossible to send Hindus back to Pakistan to live a hellish life
 ovaisi ne poocha ki phir aapane shaikh hasina se kyon kaha ki kisi ko waapas nahin bheja jayega
 Owaisi said that this is a conspiracy to create a Hindu nation, under which Muslims are being excluded
 vahi, duusari taraf naagarikta sanshodhan bill ke tahat hindu, sikh, buddha, jain jaise dharm ke logon ko basaane kii koshish ho rahi he
 If the government wants to send the refugees back, be it Hindu or Muslims
 haalanki hemanth biswa sharma ne naagarikta sanshodhan bill par kaha ki raajnneeti main kabhi-kabhi kade nirnay lene padate hai
 We decided about citizenship
 iske tahat jo hindu, buddha, sikh jain, paak yaa bangladesh main rah gaye the, unhen bharat kii naagarikta di jaani he
 We are only talking about giving citizenship to Hindus, but there is also objection to this
 biswa ne kaha ki jo bangladeshi musalmaan hai, unhone yahaan avaidh rup se bas kar hamaari raajnneeti par kabja kar liya he
 The leader of the Aam Aadmi Party and the Law Minister of Delhi, Somnath Bharti, has a long association with controversies
 itihaas he ki unka peechha hi nahin chodta
 At first glance, Bharti is in the top 200 spammers of the world, but now another new revelation has been revealed about them
 bharti spaimar hi nahin balki scamer bhi hai
 This was disclosed by renowned digital journalist Prashanto Roy from Rahul Kanwal on Friday at Centerstage
 bataaya jaataa he ki somnath bharti se associat ek company pornographic domen nem bechney ke maamle main shaamil he
 However, Bharti told Headlines Today in front of the camera and in writing that she had nothing to do with Topsite LLC
 lekin dastavej bataate hai ki unka yah bayaan puri tarah se jhootha he
 Reports state that Bharti was one of the top three spammers in the country
 america kii ek adaalat main spam mail bhejne ke aarope main bharti par mukadmaa bhi chal chukaa he or unhone is maamle ko court ke baahar kareeb 5 hajaar dollar main settle kar liya tha
 According to the report, Bharti's name and her site are registered in ROKSO (register of non-spamming Operations)
 wo kathith taur par isko jon kennedy or paul angar ke naam se operat karte the
 Topsite LLC became Directors LLC in 2004
 bataate hai ki media elelsi ke bhi maalik bhi ye hi the
 Topsite LLC and Directories LLC are registered at the address of Malviya Nagar
 somnath kii indian company majan solutions bhi malviya nagar ke pate par darj he
 Documents state that on September 5, 2008, the nomination of Directors LLC disappeared
 haalanki bharti apane upar lagaae gaye in aaropon ko sire se galat bataate hue kehete hai ki yah unako badnaam karne kii ek sajeesh he
 But the truth is that he was not a leader in 2003-04, then why would he be maligned by the people of America or UK

 Presided over delegation-level talks
 12:00 AM saarc sammelan main shaamil nahin hone ke bharat ko faisle ko PAK ne ‘durbhagyapurna’ qaraar diya India's top off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin said it would be extremely difficult to beat the hosts in the current World T20 Championship under favorable conditions
 bharat pehle match mentern leti pich par newjiland se haar gayatha lekin usne agle match main isi tarah kii pich parapakistan ko haraakar shandaar vapasiki
 Ashwin bcci after the team's six-wicket win over Pakistan
 tv se kaha, ‘hamaari team bahut acchhee he
 When we have a day and the conditions are favorable for us, then it will be very difficult to defeat our team
 ’ lekin apwaad hote hai or bhartiya team ke saath bhi kuch avasaron par aisa hua he
 'twice the mistake in assessing the opposition team' Ashwin said, 'there will be exceptions
 ham haal main srilanka ke khilaaf pune or phir nagpur main newjiland se haar gaye the
 On both occasions the opposing team correctly compared the match to ours
 ’ vichaarsheel cricketer maane jane vaale aswin ne kaha ki bhale hi eden gardns par kaaphi turn mil rahaa tha lekin yah utana aasaan nahin tha jitna lag rahaa tha
 He said, 'ravindra Jadeja and i were bowling at a certain length
 yah mahatvapurn tha
 Ashwin also said that it was important to win the toss against Pakistan
 unhone kaha, ‘saubhaahgya se ham toss jeet gaye or pich thodaa spin le rahi thi jisase kaam aasaan ho gaya
 There was moisture in the wicket
 main soch rahaa tha ki hamen pehle gendbaaji kerani chahie
 "the off-spinner said," On such a wicket you cannot say for sure how much score you should make
 mahatvapurn yah hota he ki aap kasi hui gendbaaji karo or virdohi team ko ek nishchit score tak roko
 Once you do that, then it becomes easy to bat
 is tarah ke wicket par lakshya ko peechha karte hue aap pari ko behatar tareeke se sanvaar sakate ho
 "my goal is to bowl economically", Ashwin said, adding that he always bowled according to fielding
 unhone kaha, ‘jab ham pehle gendbaaji karte hai to main kam se kam ran dena chahta hum
 My job is to bowl according to my fielding and if i get a few wickets in the process then i become a completely different bowler
 ’ unhone iske saath hi kaha ki gendbaaji karte samay bharatiyon ke dimag main yah baat nahin thi ki unhen kitne lakshya kaa peechha karnaa he
 Ashwin said, 'we were only concerned about how to play the first five overs
 yadi ve acchhee shuruyaat karte hai to phir vaapasi karnaa aasaan nahin hota
 Ashwin admitted that the team was under pressure after the defeat in the first match against New Zealand
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaare liye use bhoolanaa or nae sire se match khelnaa jaruri tha
 We did the same
 ’wicket nahin le sake hai asvinagauratlab he ki bharat kii turn leti pichon par world tii20 ke khele gaye do maichon main aswin ne keval ek wicket liye hai
 Apart from him, the team's second spinner Ravindra Jadeja has got two wickets

 She was a scorching midwife in June 2011, when 18-year-old Lakshmi was roasting the stove in her house courtyard
 tabhi kivaad khatkhatane kii awaaj sunai di
 As Laxmi always had a habit, she left the fireplace and rushed towards the door
 dwaar par chaar ajanabi chehre the, jinhen vah pehali baar dekh rahi thi
 Before she asks 'who is whom, whom to meet'
 peeche se lakshmi kii maa namoodaar huin or jatke se uski olyi chehre par khinch di, 'andar ja, tere saasre vaale aae hai
 That day Lakshmi first came to know that she was married

 He made the rounds in the dock and tied his entire life in seven rounds with a boy of two years named Rakesh
 lekin lakshmi ne samaaj dwaara tay kii gai us jindagi ko sir jhukaakar maanane se inkaar kar diya or apane parivaar ke faisle ke khilaaf court kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 Now she has become the first girl in India whose child marriage has been declared void by the Court of Prevention of Child Marriage Act, 1929

 The family members did not even think that this simple-looking girl with sharp eyes could challenge the seven furrows and forehead sindoor
 lakshmi ke pita 50 varshiya tejaraam us din ko yaad karte hue kehete hai, 'puure din baawali bane phire thi
 Weeping and foul

 ' isse pehle ki gharavaale kuch or samaj pate, police unke ghar pahunch gai
 Tejaram says, 'we are poor people
 kort-kachhari, police-thana ham kya jaane
 'the householders wanted to support Laxmi, but they were also scared of the name of the police and the court
 phir thane main peshi hui
 The police tried to reconcile
 lakshmi ko daraaya-dhamkaaya bhi, lekin uskaa faisla nahin badla
 Rakesh's family was relatively wealthy
 uske pita tarachand thekedaari karte the
 One day he reached Loni with two to four batons in a Bullero cart
 us din bhi lakshmi usee angan main rotiyaan senk rahi thi or darwaja bhi usee ne kholaa tha
 Then the whole village panchayat sat
 ab kya kiya jaae
 The girl is ready to die, but not to go to her in-laws' house
 lekin tabhi gaanv ke ek akhbaar vaale ne ek kaagaj par likhakar anpadh lakshmi ko ek pataa diya
 It was known that the Sarathi Trust of Jodhpur, with the help of its director Kriti Bharti, finally reached the Lakshmi court and the court in its judgment declared her child marriage void
 bharti kahati hai, 'lakshmi jab mere paas ai to bahut dari hui thi
 Rakesh's family members from police to goons took him to take him to his in-laws' house
 lekin yah us ladki kii himmat hi thi ki vah unke aage jhuki nahin
 Rakesh was not initially ready to accept the verdict, but after counseling by the trust, he finally agreed to sign the affidavit in front of the notary, according to which the annulment of a child marriage at the age of one year It has been said
 yah ghatana 24 april, 2012 kii he
 Nearly a year after the court's decision, now Lakshmi has remarried to a boy of her choice
 jodhpur se 30 kimi dur sthit gaanv rohat nivasee mahendra sargaara se lakshmi kii pehali mulaakaat apane padosi ke ghar main hui thi
 Both of them saw each other, fell in love and now after marriage Lakshmi is very happy in her new in-laws

 He says, 'I love Lakshmi and want to keep her happy with my hard work
 ' lakshmi bhi sirf himmat hi nahin, balki atmasamman se chhalkati hui stri he

 lakshmi ko dekhakar kai ladkiyaan sasuraal jane se inkaar kar rahi hai
 'lakshmi's family has also learned a lesson from this incident

 ajay apni maa or bahan ke saath gaanv kii raksha karte hai or sarpanch kii beti tamanna se pyaar
 There are other twists in the story that one can see in the film
 'himmatwala' rimek he isliye jaahir he, diarector sajid khan ne 80 ke dashak ke har masaale ko daalaa he
 Where the forced mother is, the destitute is the sister and the sarpanch's persecuted villagers
 film main vaise hi dialog hai, vaise hi drametic seen or waisi hi sichuation
 Both the old songs of 'himmatwala' look good in this film too
 ajay devgan kaa abhinay acha he
 Tamannaah is also good in the film
 tippaniyan Director Sajid Khan, who has made hit films 'hey Baby' and 'housefull', has caught a formula in which monkeys sometimes take lions in their films so that children can also have fun
 sajid kii koshish hoti he, masala film banane kii, jisamen har tarah kaa tadakaa maujuud ho
 Although many scenes in the film are quite dramatic, which seems strange, but since it was such a cinema hit in those times, they have to be ignored
 kul milakar kah sakate hai ki yah 80 ke dashak kaa laud cinema he, jise aaj ke daur main pesh kiya gaya he
 If you like cinema of that era, 'himmatwala' will suit you

 'himmatwala' is a remake so obviously, director Sajid Khan has added every spice of the 80s
 jahaan majaboor maa he, besahaara bahan he or sarpanch ke sataae hue gaanvvaale hai
 The film has the same dialogue, the same dramatic scene and the same situation
 'himmatwala' ke donon puraane gane is film main bhi achche lag rahe hai
 Ajay Devgan's acting is good
 tamanna bhi film main acchhee lagi hai
 The comments hit film 'he baby' or 'housephul' bana chuke diarector sajid khan ne ek formula pakadaa he, jisamen kabhi bandar to kabhi sher ko apni film main lete hai taaki bachche bhi maje le saken
 Sajid tries to make a masala film, which has all kinds of tempering
 haalanki film me kai seen kaaphi drametic hai, jo atapate lagate hai, magar chunki us daur main aisa cinema hit tha isliye unhen nazarandaaj karnaa padataa he

 ''khud ko pakistani kii tarah bolta paakar main khud hairaan tha
 Pakistanis have no idea that they are talking to any Indian
 '' pankaj kanvar, kanpur main tainaat karnalsan 1999 main kargil yuddh shuru hone se pehle tak bharat kii khufia agenciyaan pakistani sainya guton ke thikaanon or unki gatividhiyon se puri tarah anjaan thim
 When the Indian Army started the war, it had only the old Order of Battle or Orbet (military design and soldiers' bases), which was provided to them by the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Military Intelligence (MI)
 khufia jaankaree tab jaakar thodi-thodi ikatthi hone lagi jab ek bhartiya sainya adhikari ne pakistani adhikari kaa bhesh dharkar sidhe pakistani thikaanon par phone ghumaya or unki gatividhiyon kii khufia jaankaree hasil kii
 Colonel Pankaj Kanwar says that between May and July 1999, he made about 6,000 phone calls to Pakistani infantry and armored units
 sankshipt baatcheet ke jariye unhone pakistani sena kii gatividhiyon, tainatiyon, hataahaton or uske manobal ke bare main pataa lagaaya tha
 It was through this that the Indian Army came to know about the military activities of its nuclear-powered enemy
 isi tarah kii kuch khufia jaankaree ke aadhaar par bhartiya sena kaa akalan tha ki pakistan vivaad ko kargil se aage badhaane kaa icchhuk nahin he
 Kanwar, currently posted in Kanpur, is angry that he has not received any proper credit in Operation Dial Hard
 unhone isi saal 12 june ko sainya pramukh general ve
 K
 singh ko is babat ek vistrut shikayati patr bheja he, jo pichley ek dashak main bheje gaye kai patron kii shrinkhalaa kaa tazatreen patr he
 In this letter, Kanwar has complained that senior officials took all the credit by ignoring his contribution
 may, 1999 main military intelligence (pakistan desk) main emi25 ke pramukh brigadier rakesh goyal ne kanvar se, jo us vakt major pad par the, pakistani uniton main phone kar jaankaree nikaalane ke liye kaha tha
 The Indian Army had already started Operation Vijay to liberate Kargil's snow-laden high peaks from the Pakistani attackers and take it back
 emi ke agent baari-bharkam tainaati ke kaaran seemaa paar nahin kar paa rahe the
 The Indian Army wanted to know what changes have been made in Pakistan's orbate in response to the Indian attack
 kanvar ne pakistani sena ke telephone kendron main dilli chhavnee ke bheetar sthit ek astidi booth se phone lagaae the
 The first success came on 4 June 1999 in a call to a military unit in Peshawar
 kanvar likhte hai, ''iske baad maine kabhi palatakar nahin dekha
 "sometimes by becoming 'major Iqbal' and sometimes by becoming 'major Hassan', while speaking pure Punjabi, he would ask to place the phone in a particular military base
" ek baar oparavtor us unit main phone milakar detaa to phir ve kisi kaalpanik sainya adhikari kaa naam lekar usase baat karwaane ke liye kehete
 They would listen very carefully to every small information given by the person sitting on the other side of the phone and find out which unit it is, where it is located and whether it has moved from its location or not
 
 kanvar ne pakistani sena ke lagbhag sabhi thikaanon or uniton main, yahaan tak ki bannu or kohat jaise doordaraj ke sainya thikaanon par bhi, baat karne ke liye sainya pratishthanon main 'khaas' nagarikon ke baat karne ke liye die gaye code kaa istemaal kiya
 Kanwar would either call Alsubuh before the office opened or call in the afternoon when there were no officials in the office
 choti-badi harek jaankaree nikalwane ke liye ve khud ko alag-alag rank kaa bataate jaise gaiyr-kamishan adhikari, duty babu or kanishtha adhikari
 One of the successes he received was information that revealed that the 11th platoon at Peshawar and the 12th platoon at Quetta were deployed along the border with India
 unhone yah pataa bhi lagaaya ki ''pakistani thikaanon se sambandhit hamaare paas maujuud lagbhag 50 fisadi orbet galat tha
 Kanwar also placed a call at the house of Northern Light Infantry Officer Captain Mazrullah Khan in Lahore
 uskaa phone number bhartiya sainikon ko kargil kii pahadiyon par sthit ek bunker se mila tha
 Kanwar, after talking to an injured young officer rescued from Kargil, came to the conclusion that there was no one else but the Pakistan Army who could capture the peak of Kargil
 kanvar ne apni koi bhi baatcheet record to nahin kii, lekin har baatcheet kaa puraa byora unki ek file main jarur darj tha
 After the war, Kanwar was told that his work could not be mentioned as it would adversely affect the preparedness of MI25 and intelligence units deployed around the battlefield
 kanvar ke varisht adhikariyon ne emi ke mahanideshak yaa sainya pramukh ko unke yogadan ke bare main nahin bataaya
 Kanwar is bitter because his service record does not even mention his contribution to the Kargil war
 sena pramukh ko likhe apane patr main kanvar ne likhaa he, ''ise brigadier goyal kii yojana bataaya gaya or yahi nahin balki yah bhi kaha gaya ki yuddh ke dauraan pakistani sena se sampark saadhane vaale adhikari koi or hi the, mere yogadan ko dabaaya gaya or iskaa mahatv kam kiya gaya

 "what Kanwar did in the midst of war was an extraordinary work," says Joseph
 sainikon kii twarit or vaastavik gatividhiyon kii jaankaree pataa lagane ke liye kanvar ne apane buddhikaushal kaa istemaal kiya
 "last year, the Armed Forces Tribunal refused to look into Kanwar's case on the grounds that it lacked experts to evaluate the merits of the case
" '' is faisle ne phone se mahatvapurn jaankariyaan nikaalane vaale kanvar ko patr likhane vaala aisa yachikakarta bana diya jo nyaay paane kaa drudh sankalp he
