" ’ In Vedic Sanskrit, yoga means to add and to venture to join is called a yogi
 aadhyatmik arth main to yoga kaa matlab he vyakti kaa samshti main yaa ishwartv main villin hokar ek ho janaa
 But for Yogi Adityanath, after attaining worldly or worldly power, this challenge has become immense
 agar uttar pradesh ek desh hota, to apni 20
 With a population of 400 million, it would have been the fifth most populous country in the world
 dharm, jati, samaaj, arthvyavastha or bhugol, har lihaaj se apni charam vividhta or tikhe bantwaaron ke liye mashhoor is rajya ko ekasutra main baandhe rakhana devataaon tak ke liye chunauti hota
 In the conversation, Yogi Adityanath expresses something that he has got the responsibility of being the Chief Minister of the most populous state of India by some divine law
 lakhanu ke bichobich apane sarkari awaas main, jahaan baithkar ve aagantukon se milte or baatcheet karte hai, sofe par bhagava aavaran chadhaakar bahut kuch jaahir kar diya gaya he
 In the saffron clothes that have become his identity, he seems happy using the power that came with this position, and despite the severe setbacks he has suffered in recent times, he seems confident
 rajpaat milane ke bilkul shuruaati josh main unhone uttar pradesh main 15 saal ke antaraal ke baad bhaajapa kii sarkaar ke lautne kii munaadi karne kii garaj se kuch sarkari imaaraton or bason tak ko nae sire se bhagava rang se pot dene kaa farmaan de daalaa tha
 When India Today asked him whether taking the position of power like this was the right path for a yogi, he said with confidence, "when kings go astray, there are instances that yogis and ascetics have taken responsibility
 koi yogi or sanyasi hi behatar nattejey de saktaa he
 He also justified his new responsibility and said that the "lazy leaders of the state of the last decade are responsible for the ruin of Uttar Pradesh
" nihitaswarthon kii raajnneeti or kamjor netritv kii vajah se rajya ko nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he
 They destroyed institutions and pushed the state to the brink of ruin
 pichley dashak main logon ke dimag main jo nakaaratmak dharanaen ban gai thim, pichley ek saal main ham unhen badalane main safal hue hai
 In March 2017, when the Mahants of Gorakhnath Math were elected to the position of Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, surprising everyone, they used to compete with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to grab the attention of the media
 bhagava halkon main charchaa thi ki bahut mumkin he ki tikhe or vibhaajankaree bayanon ke liye mashhoor yah netaa modi ke hindutv kaa uttaradhikari ho
 But in the last few months, difficulties have come in trucks for them - some of these problems have been invited by the yogi himself
 unke rajkaaj kaa pehla saal vaaki agnipariksha jaisaa rahaa or adityanath isamen buree tarah jhulas gaye
 It has not only made a mark in his aura of being a saffron bahubali of the Hindi heartland, but has also raised serious doubts about his ability to run the most important province of India politically
 haalanki zyaadaatar log maanate hai ki ve haal ke varshon main rajya ke sabase karmath or mehnatee mukhyamantriyon main hai
 His day passes into extremely tedious and hectic schedules, which begin at 4 am and go on till midnight
 unki nijee eemaandaaree par katai koi sawaal nahin he or desh ke sabase bhrasht suubon main shumaar is rajya main unhone paardarshita or saaf-suthere lenden par behad kadai se jor diya he
 He has done his best to solve the big issues of the state - farmers suffering problems, poor development work, removing regional imbalances and enticing investors back to the state (see talk)
 unhen is baat kaa shrey diya janaa chahie ki unhone rajya main mafia raaj khatm karne ke liye sarkari thekon ke liye i-nivida pranali shuru kii or board kii parikshaon main nakal virdohi upayon kii khud nigaraanee kii
 He is also acutely aware of the bad results of the agenda of Hindutva which Adityanath had strongly emphasized on assuming the reins
 inamen govadh par pabandi ke natijatan hone vaale aarthik nuksaan bhi shaamil hai
 This is the reason that later with this ban, he slowed down on "antio-romeo" squads and "love Jihad" too
 haalanki ve mandir mudde se nahin dige or ayodhya main bhavy diwaali kaa aayojan kiya
 Even though they have not left any mark in the government, they have implemented the centrally sponsored schemes of housing and sanitation with dedication and readiness
 saath hi, unhone rajya ke kisaanon kii maangon ko puraa karne ke liye khaasi dariyaadilii dikhaai he or isamen unke kul 36,000 karod ru
 Debt forgiveness is also included
 haalanki sarkaar chalaane kii naatajurbekaari apni keemat vasuul rahi he or yah hakeekat aag main ghi kaa kaam kar rahi he ki unke mantrimandal ke zyaadaatar saathi bhi nausikhue hai
 The state treasury is in a very shabby condition
 unki sarkaar ko rajya ke oonche rajkoshiya ghate or karj ke boj ko kam karne kaa thos rodmap abhi bananaa he
 The state's debt liability is, to an astounding extent, as high as 30 per cent of GSDP, twice that of southern states with fiscal discipline
 yahi nahin, itane vishaal rajya ko chalaane ke liye ek majboot, tajurbekaar or faisle lene vaale netaa kii jarurat he, jo jaanata ho ki siyasat or prashasan ke bich santulan bithakar kaise uskaa asardaar istemaal kiya jaae
 But Yogis seem to be surrounded by many centers of power, which confine their ability to make independent decisions
 inamen sabase awwal to pradhanmantri karyaalay he jo unke kaamkaaj or tarakkee par kareeb se najar rakhata he, tab to or bhi jab unki sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj 2019 main modi ke dobaaraa chune jane ke liye behad ahm he
 Then there is party president Amit Shah, who has to balance the pulls and pressures of allies, besides party mps and mlas from the state
 unke do up-mukhyamantri bhi hai, jinaki unke prati koi nijee vafadari nahin he, usee tarah jaise unke bahut saare duusare mantriyon kii bhi nahin he
 At the same time, there is a bureaucracy, which has the expertise in cleverly using the disparate structure of power in the state, and as a result, to shut down the government
 vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa ram govind chedhri majaak udaate hai, "sapa kii hukumat ke dauraan bhaajapa hameshaa kahati thi ki rajya main saadhe paanch mukhyamantri hai
 But now there are eight Chief Ministers in the state under the BJP — with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as well as two Deputy Chief Ministers, State President of BJP, State Secretary General of BJP, RSS, PMO and National President of BJP acting as Super CM of the state Huh
 ''yogi adityanath kii pratishtha ko tab gaharaa dhakka laga jab bhaajapa haal hi main rajya kii do behad ahm loksabhaa siton—gorakhpur (jahaan se yogi adityanath pichley saal istipha dene se pehle paanch baar chune gaye the) or phulpur (jahaan se up-mukhyamantri keshav prasad maury ne rajya mantrimandal main shaamil hone ke baad istipha diya tha)—ke upachunaav haar gai
 This defeat not only became a personal insult to Yogi but it also exposed the bitter reality of his being cut off from the ground reality
 isane party ko jhakzor kar rakh diya, kyonki uski mutthi se ek ahm jeet chin lene ke liye uske do kattar pratidwandviyon, samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ne haath mila liya tha
 Not long ago, in March 2017, the BJP and its allies won a landslide majority (325 seats out of 403) in the assembly elections and in 2014 won most of the Lok Sabha seats (73 out of 80)

 But its image among Dalits has been tarnished
 pradesh ke ek dalit saansad chhotelal kharwar ne modi or party adhyaksh amit shah ko chitthee likhakar rajya sarkaar or party kii pradesh ikai dwaara jatigat aadhaar par bhedbhaav kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Three other prominent Dalit mps also accused the state government of harassing the Dalit community and even said that the BJP intends to abolish reservations
 in aaropon ke jawaab main pradesh bhaajapa ne dalit adhikariyon kii ek suchi jari kii or bataaya ki sarkaar ke 25 sheersh padon par dalit adhikari baithe hai
 Party spokesperson Drs
 chandramohan kehete hai, "pichhali sarkaar ne daliton kii andekhi kii thi jabaki yogi sarkaar ne unhen bharpoor sammaan or sthaan diya he
 Meanwhile, the stakes of introducing Yogi as the chief minister who is gearing up for the elimination of criminal elements from Uttar Pradesh, notorious for crime, are now looking backfired
 bhaajapa ne vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan sapa ke shashan main khastahal kanoon-vyavastha kii baat jor-shor se uthaai thi or rajya ko aparadhmukt karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 After taking oath as Chief Minister, Adityanath, after seeing the rising graph of crime, gave the state police complete leeway and allowed them to do whatever they had to do to eliminate the criminals

 yadav ne aisa karne se manaa kiya to donon ke bich tikhi nok-jhonk jald hi jhagade main badal gai or darshan ne yadav ko gaadi se baahar khinchakar goli maar di
 Darshan then phoned his superiors to inform about the encounter
 yadav ke parivaar ne iske khilaaf shikaayat darj karai or aarambhik jaanch main maamla kuch or jaan padaa
 Darshan was arrested and sent to jail while three other policemen present at the time of the incident were suspended

 '' doshi pulicekarmiyon ko dandit kiya ja rahaa he phir bhi aisi chhavi ban gai he ki police andhadhundh encounter kar rahi he
 The biggest hug for the Chief Minister has become that he is unable to take action against his party workers even if he is found involved in crime

 After this, the Mumbai Police started gathering solid evidence related to this case
 mumbai police shuukravaar ko pen panhuch gai
 Excavation of the place where the skeleton was found began

 Meanwhile, it was revealed that the corpse whose remains were sent to the JJ Hospital in May 2012 were safe in the hospital
 tippaniyan JJ Hospital Dean Dr Lahane said the hospital had kept the remains and had also given a report to the police in 2013
 dow lahane ne kaha ki jab tak police nahin kahati, aspataal is tarah ke maamalon main avshesh sambhaal ke rakhti he
 He also said that since the body was badly burnt, it was difficult to detect anything
 lekin ab avshesh ke bone tishyu ko test karke pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki diene bohara parivaar se mail khate hai yaa nahin or yah laash shina kii he yaa nahin
 Police is facing difficulties due to the case being three years old

 But if the police demand a narco or polygraph test then it can be an important link

 unhone yah bhi kaha ki chunki shav buree tarah se jal chukaa tha, aise main kuch bhi pataa laganaa mushkil tha
 But now the bone tissue of the remains can be detected by testing whether the DNA matches the Bohra family and whether the corpse belongs to Sheena

 Therefore, he has to depend on the mercy of his fiery allies
 ek mitra dal trinmul congress (tiemasi) kii shashakt lekin tunakmizaaj netaa mamata pradhanmantri ko apni mushkil dhunon par nachaa rahi hai
 Every staggering step of the Prime Minister is an indication of the extent to which he can go to save his chair
 jab mamata ne dussahas karne vaale dinesh trivedi, ko hataane ke liye kaha to manmohan singh ne ghutane tekte hue unki maang maan lee
 Mamta has been wreaking havoc on Delhi ever since she won Bengal from the Communists
 unki har sanak, har jhllaahat shakti kaa pradarshan he kyonki unke paas 19 saansad hai
 Their support is necessary for the decaying UPA government to remain in power
 mamata jab chahengi ki bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak main sanshodhan kiya jaae to sanshodhan nishchit rup se hoga
 When she wants to embarrass the Prime Minister with her disagreement over the Teesta water sharing with Bangladesh, Manmohan will go to Dhaka without her
 jab ve rashtriya ekta parishad kii baithak main shaamil hona nahin chahengi, nahin shaamil hongi
 When she, along with other like-minded people, opposes foreign investment in retail, the Center will put its plan on hold
 jab ve mukul raay jaise netaa ko trivedi kii jagah bithaana chahengi, to bitha dengi
 She wanted the rail freight to be reduced, so it was done
 so, ab yah baat maan lee gai he ki gussai didi ko upie sarkaar main dakhlandaji kii puri aazaadee he
 But the UPA government has no freedom to do anything of its own accord
 didi aisa kar sakati hai kyonki ve shikhar par khadi hai or upie maranasann padaa he
 If they are the embodiment of the ultimate power of a raptured mass leader, then the UPA is like a house on the verge of disintegration
 ve nae josh se bhare mitra dalon kii pratyaksh pratinidhi hai jo hamalaa karne ke liye taiyaar to hai, lekin maarane ke liye nahin
 The dead UPA will not cater to the interests of allies, but the wobbling, flattering, begging of lives in Delhi will fulfill their every wish
 ve jo bhi keemat chahenge, thodi-si saudebaaji se mil jaaegi
 His best example is his anger at the Planning Commission's March 19 decision

 The figures are completely incorrect
 upie ke ghatak dal aise samay main aakraamak hue hai jab bharat kii janata satta-virdohi mood main he
 Uttar Pradesh's clear mandate earlier this month and the March 21 by-election results indicate that there is anger among the people against the ruling parties

 The Prime Minister had said, 'I think the honorable members also feel that due to our coalition government, it becomes even more difficult to take difficult decisions
 hamen sarvasammati banaae rakhane kii jarurat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue niti banani padegi
 'this was not a strong statement against the constituents, yet the generally quiet Maratha leaders were hurt
 ek din baad, pavaar ne media se kaha ki unki party ke kuch sadasyon ne unase shikaayat kii ki anya saajheedaaron ke saath ensipi ko bhi bematlab nishaanaa banaaya gaya jabaki vah kisi tarah kii pareshaani khadi nahin karti
 Pawar said, 'NCP has been with Congress for the last 7-8 years, but there is not a single instance when we have behaved irresponsibly
 hamane sansad yaa cabinet kii baithkon kaa kabhi bahishkaar nahin kiya he
 When we sit down to discuss policy issues, it is natural for differences to occur
 lekin ek baar cabinet ke faisla le lene par hamane saarvajanik rup se uskaa virodh kabhi nahin kiya
 We are hurt and saddened by the Prime Minister's flat statement
 ’ upie ko samarthan dene ke aath saal main yah pehla mauka he jab pavaar ne apni pidaa vyakt kii he
 Pawar has been a staunch supporter of the government on almost all policies
 iske baavjood unka maananaa he ki sarkaar ne aise kai muddon par unke vichaaron kii andekhi kar di he jo desh ke krishi mantri ke rup main unke liye mahatvapurn hai
 The Food Security Bill, the decision to ban the export of cotton and onion and to allow bt-brinjal are examples of this
 vaanijya mantralay ne pavaar se paraamarsh kiye bina kapaas ke niryaat par pratibandh lagane kaa faisla kar liya
 When Pawar angrily opposed it, the government withdrew the decision as it did not want to offend another constituent

 tiemasi ne neshnal counter terarysm centre ke masale par vaak out kiya lekin mayawati or mulaayam ne sarkaar kaa samarthan kiya
 But the Congress's hope was shattered when Mulayam said later that afternoon that he was not interested in replacing Mamata
 unhone sawaal kiya, ‘ek saal ke liye sarkaar main shaamil hone kii kya tuk he?’ unhone spasht kiya ki bhaajapa ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye ve sarkaar ko baahar se mudde par aadhaarit samarthan dete rahenge
 Why did Mulayam Singh say 'one year'? There are two years left for the government

 For example, they have to first fix their seating chart in Parliament

 -input bhashaa The controversy has once again arisen over the history books of Punjab Shiksha Board on 11th and 12th
 kuch maheene pehle inhen itihaas kii kitabon se sikh dharm guruon ke jivan se jude chapter hataane ko lekar bavaal machaa tha, lekin ab jo nai kitaaben or chapter shiksha vibhaag ne apni website par online aplod kiye hai unako lekar bhi vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 At the same time, the Akali Dal has alleged that objectionable terminology has been used in these books about Sikh Gurus and many facts have either been deliberately removed or have been twisted and written in books with incomplete information
 akali dal kaa aarope he ki jaanboojhkar ek ke baad ek is tarah kii galtiyaan karkepunjabashiksha board or shiksha mantralay sikh guruon ke itihaas ko chaatro tak galat tareeke se pesh kar rahaa he
 The Akali Dal has demanded the removal of these newly uploaded books and their chapters soon
 unka aarope he ki sikh dharmaguruon ko lekar in kitabon main kuch aisi galtiyaan kii gai he
 Like: - Guru Arjun Dev ji was not martyred but he was released by the Mughal rulers by paying a fine
 - guru hargovind singh ji shikaar khilne ke shaukeen the or shraddhaluon kii jagah dushton ko tarjeeh diya karte the
 - Guru Govind Singh ji left the battle of Chamkaur Sahib in the middle and went quietly
 - guru teg bahadur sahib ko lekar bhi paathyakram main tathyon se chhedchhad or kai jaruri tathy hataane ke aarope hai
 - Guru Govind Singh ji looted a village, there are many other facts like those which have been written in the chapters of history and the Akali Dal has strong objection to these things
 is tarah kii galtiyaan saamne aane ke baad jahaan ek or punjab shiksha board or shiksha mantri baikfoot par hai or puri tarah se chuppi saadh lee he to vahiin punjab congress ke pravaktaa bhi is maamle main galati hone kii baat kabool kar rahe hai or jaanch karvaa kar is tarah ke chaptaron ko hataane kii baat kah rahe hai
 Punjab Congress spokesperson Rajkumar Verka could not answer the question in which he was repeatedly asked why such mistakes are being made in the 11th and 12th history books of Punjab Education Board regarding Sikhism gurus? Mistakes have been done
 The Punjab Education Board has made such mistakes in the past too, in which the chapters associated with Sikhism gurus have either been removed or Addiction went the information
 ab jis tarah se ek baar phir isi tarah se galtiyaan doharaai gai he to aise main ye sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki tamaam shikshavid or itihaas ke jaankaar hone ke baavjood bhi punjab shiksha board kii kitabon main is tarah kii galtiyaan aakhirkaar baar-baar kyun ho rahi hai

 The Trust should help in clearing the water problem in Latur rather than spreading confusion

 Comments He said, his (shelar's) phone was very reassuring, but the concern started growing as the mobile network weakened
 yah bachaane waalon ke liye bhi badi samasya thi, jo unhen khojane kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 Eventually, around 11
 55 baje ek chor par mumbai fire brigade seedhi ko dekh un logon ne us samay raahat kii saans lee

 On the other hand, the MCD says that they had orders for demolition operations

 The MCD alleges that the MLA scrambled with JE Mustafa and tore the papers from him

 All these people today have united in protest against the decision of Delhi University to increase the undergraduate course from three years to four years
 is bheed main 21 saal kaa ek ladkaa rajesh bhaati sabase oonchi aawaaj main naare laga rahaa he
 Rajesh is a BA third year student from Political Science
 greater noida ke paas ek chote se gaanv kaa yah ladkaa subah ek mobile shop main naukari karata he or dopaher main greater noida se north campus aakar class karata he
 The fee burden on his poor family had doubled only after splitting the three-year course into six semesters, but now studying for four years will become more difficult
 rajesh kahata he, 'ghar main chote bhai-bahan hai
 Expenses will increase bahan ko padhaanaa to dur, bhai ko bhi graduate bananaa mushkil hoga
 On the other hand, Prof

 com / vtrr7khqnp — Veere Di Wedding (@vdwthefilm) September 14, 2017 kitaab:terresaj main and adars stories from goa (kahani sangrah)lekhak:damodar maujoprakashak:roopa publikeshnakimat:174 rupekhushnaseeb hai ve log jo apni maa-boli main sochate hai, sapane dekhte hai or usee main likhte hai
 Popular recognition in those countries is also similar
 vahaan logon kii maadare-jabaan pashchimi samrajyavad kii bhashaai fouj ke khilaaf lard rahi hai
 This imperial place in India is of English
 konkani main likhane vaale damodar maujo aise hi ek lekhak hai
 Konkani is one of the 22 old and weighty languages that were given formal status in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution
 bhashaa ke indo-aryan vriksh kii dakshini shakha main marathi ke saath konkani kaa pataa bhi miltaa he
 It is the formal language of Goa and is used by Hindus and Christians as well as some Muslim groups from South Goa and the Malabar Coast
 konkani kaa yah vistaar portugaliyon ke jariye sambhav hua
 He emphasized more linguistic expansion than his colonial interest and forced the dominant Brahmin farming class to use it as well
 lekhak mangalore ke paas se aane vaale konkanibhashi hai
 This area is also green like Goa filled with pine trees
 yahaan vah samudri tat bhi he jahaan masaaledaar fish kari ke liye dher sara pyaar sangrakshit he
 In Goa, Konkani and its folklore rule, but in Mangalore it has learned a lot from Kannada and Tulu and has incorporated it into the sounds of speaking
 damodar maujo ke choti kahaniyon ke sangrah 'terresaj main and adar stories from goa' ko roopa publication ne chapa he
 It is like a mirror astonishing the writer with childhood memories spent in Mangalore
 is kahani kaa ek kirdaar he jo bade se kaanse ke bartan se nahaata he
 For this, water is brought from the well of the house and it is heated on the flame of dry pine leaves
 yah us samay se pehle kii baat he jab bharat ke gaanvon main bijli apane jaruri voltage main aani shuru nahin hui thi
 In addition to childhood memorabilia, the book contains stories that take birth in a turbulent society
 apane paaramparik saanche main thartharaate or phir bhi na fatate hue samaaj main
 The storytelling is as muktalif as the aspirations of women
 chaahe vah pati kii aruchi se kunthit aurat kii chumban kii chaah ho, duusari kahani main kaamgaar patni ko petakar mardaangi par garv karata sharaabi-vyabhichari pati ho yaa gaanvon main aasthaa kii aniyamitataayen hon jaise yah ki garibi kii skirt sirf ek dhaage kii chaudaai jitani oonchi hoti he
 In the same book, you will find the superficial confidence of some of the less well-educated villagers in the village, the ambience of the towns and the false gurus arising from it, political pressure and attempts to dominate and the victory achieved by the wife's secret ballot over her husband's autocracy
 aadhuniktaa kaa zikr baar-baar hota he, lekin antat: har baar vah us purush-pradhanta ke samanurup sabit hoti he jo shaayad duniya kii sabase puraani vyavastha he
 The man always wants to keep himself the head, but the women are just somehow engaged in the upbringing of their husbands and children
 or agar ghar main jaanavar hai to unhen paalane main
 The woman has to love everything around her, even the animal
 lekin uskaa pyaar aavashyaktaa-janit zyada hota he kyonki baxon main bache-khuche rupee khatm ho chuke hote hai or kheton main dhan kii buaai jaruri hoti he
 If anyone criticizes these feminist lines, then a complaint against Maujo will emerge more clearly
 lekin sabhi lekhakon kii tarah maujo bhi bhashaa kii simaaon, uske vaishvik najariye or shilp se bandhe hue najar aate hai
 Any feminist attack on them would not be considered worthy of response and would be dismissed immediately
 jayalalita or mamata ke kuch raajnneetik sandarbhon kaa zikr bhi aata he, par dhundhala hokar chalaa jaataa he
 But there are some other things that get attention
 udhaaharan ke liye vishesh adhikaar
 It is the story of a poverty-stricken shepherd who cannot sell his cattle and raise the resources of his family to raise them
 kya yah kisi ore ishaara karti hui kahani he?kitaab main ek ladke kaa pichhadi jati kii ek ladki ke liye kishor or kaamuk pyaar ke sandarbh he
 Here bulls are sold for the wedding of lovers
 ladke kaa naam he halasiddu or ladki kaa anshi
 When Halasiddu reveals his love, his father scolds him, 'how can this happen? They are sought, we are Mahars
 ' halasiddu kii maa kahati he, 'maanga hamase neeche aate hai
 But they consider themselves above us
 'baad main vah ladkaa biaar ambedkar kii aatma ko bulaakar apane mata-pita ko chaunkaa detaa he
 His parents had explained the importance of school to him in the name of Ambedkar
 kahani shaadi par nahin, balki gauvadh virdohi bheed dwaara charvaahe kii pitayee par khatm hoti he
 And in the end he continues to curse those who love animals but beat humans
 konkan samaaj main jatvaad kaa zikr nahin he, jo gaharaa he or thik vaisaa akshunn he jaisaa manu use chhod gaye the
 The last story of the book is 'A Writer's Tale'
 ' kaise ek lekhak dilli main ek sahitya sammelan main ek or lekhak ke liye kahani ban jaataa he
 But this time from a writer and a psychiatric patient
 purvaagrah, purvaagrah or kuch or purvaagrah
 Or maybe the story is 'just' a story, though it is much more than that
 shaayad maujo ke haath main aaina he, lekin vah uski ore dekh nahin rahe hai
 a 60-year-old woman died in Goa from Kaysanur Forest Disease (KFD)
 keendi ko saamaanya taur par manki fever kaha jaataa he or rajya main is saal manki fever se maut kaa yah pehla maamla he
 State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told reporters that the deceased Janaki Desai was undergoing treatment at Goa Medical College Hospital (GMCH) here and died on Sunday
 rajya main mahadei vanyajeev abhayaarany se lage uttar purvi hisse ke sattari taluka ke antargat aane vaale mauxi, jarmen, copordem, budrak, karmali or saleli gaanvon main yah bukhaar failaa hua he

 use 13 janvari ko jiemasiech main sthanantarit kar diya gaya
 Betodkar said that so far 24 patients have received positive results of Monkey Fever examination from Sattari and these people are being treated
 rajya main pichley saal bicholim taluka ke paale gaanv main pehali baar manki fever kaa pataa chalaa tha or chaar logon kii isse jaan chali gai thi
 The comments swasthya mantri francis disuja ne purv main rajya vidhansabha main kaha tha ki sarkaar ne in gaanvon main tikaakaran abhiyaan chalaaya he lekin pratikri utsahjanak nahin he
 KFD is a hemorrhage fever caused by the virus that spreads in South Asia
 bharat main 1957 main pehali baar karnataka ke kyasanur van main is beemaari ke hone kii khabar ai thi
 After this, the monkeys came in its grip and many lost their lives
 tab se beemaari ko sthaneey log ‘‘manki fever’’ kehane lage
 The fever is widespread in the villages of Mouxi, Jermaine, Kopordem, Budrak, Karmali and Saleli under the Sattari taluka of the North Eastern part of the state, adjacent to the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary
 unhone bataaya ki mauxi main rahane vaali desai ko bukhaar kii shikaayat hone par 11 janvari ko walpoi ke praathmik swasthya centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 He was transferred to GMCH on 13 January
 betodkar ne bataaya ki sattari se ab tak 24 marijon kii manki fever sambandhi jaanch ke nattejey positive aae hai or in logon kaa ilaaj kiya ja rahaa he
 Last year, Monkey Fever was detected in Pale village of Bicholim taluka in the state last year and four people lost their lives
 tippaniyan Health Minister Francis d'souza had earlier said in the state assembly that the government has launched a vaccination campaign in these villages, but the response is not encouraging
 keendi virus kii vajah se hone vaala hemorage bukhaar he jo dakshin asia main failata he
 In India, for the first time in 1957, the disease was reported in the Kisanur forest in Karnataka
 iske baad bandar isaki chapet main aae or kai kii jaan chali gai
 Since then, the locals started calling the disease a "monkey fever"

 purv rakshaamantri ne bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) par 'jhooth gadhane' ke liye kendriya agenciyon kaa istemaal karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Antony said during a conversation with the media, 'lie on lie, they (BJP) want to create something from nothing
 ve jhooth gadhane ke liye agenciyon kaa durupyog kar rahe hai
 He said, 'I want to say clearly that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi never interfered in defense deals
 rakshaamantri ke rup main mere puure kaarykaal ke dauraan unhone kabhi raksha saudon main hastkshep nahin kiya
 On the other hand, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) probing the multi-million rupees agustawestland deal case told the special court that Mitchell had named Mrs Gandhi and a big man 'R' in the case, who were in charge of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 Seems to be about idi ke is khulaase ke baad bhaajapa gandhi parivaar par nishaanaa saadh rahi he

 At the same time, the Congress alleges that the Narendra Modi government is misusing the central agency to target the Gandhi family

 gat 7 aktubar ko centre ne supreme court main muslimon main jari teen talaak, nikaah halaala or bahuvivaah prathaon kaa virodh kiya tha or langik samanta evam dharmanirpekshata ke aadhaar par inpar dobaaraa gaur karne kii vakaalat kii thi

 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Naidu said, after discussion, the Government of India has voted that the triple talaq is not in the interest of women
 ise khatm hona chahie
 Naidu's statement is significant in the sense that many Muslim organizations and leaders, including members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, are insisting that 'sharia law cannot be changed

 It is being told that under the plan of expansion of Surat, a big plot has been given to him separately instead of his small plot
 tippaniyan Actually, a new town planning is being made for the expansion of Surat by building a ring road on the outskirts of the city

 As per the planning of town planning, 40% of this land, ie about 12,000 square meters, had to be left for city planning, it was decided

 Not only this, the purpose of the land associated with this plot was for social infrastructure has also been changed
 ab ise sports complex banane kii taiyaari shuru ho gai he
 Along with the Dharmanandan group, the state minister of state for youth and sports, Nanu Vannani, has also recommended to build a sports complex
 jaahir he, agar ek bade plot ke paas is tarah kaa sports complex ban jayega, to zamin kii keemat main izapha ho jayega or isse group ko karodon kaa faaydaa pahonchega
 The Congress is alleging that it is being kindly paid to the Dharmanandan Group in lieu of buying the 'modi suit'

 Obviously, if such a sports complex is built near a large plot, then the price of the land will increase and the group will get the benefit of crores

 Governor Najeeb Jung is calling for the Transaction Business Rules regarding the Jan Lokpal and questions on the Delhi Police's letter of not being able to provide security at the stadium
 grahamantri scindia samvidhan kii duhai dekar sawaal kejariwal ke kaamkaaj ke taur-tareekon par hi uthaa rahe hai
 Then where does the road to Delhi go? Kejriwal cannot live without Janlokpal
 dilli police apni fajiyat ke baad kejariwal kii stadium main vidhansabha kaa satr bulaane ko safal hone de nahin sakati
 Shinde is bound by the law and politics of the Center, whose figure of thirty-six is from Kejriwal
 kejariwal agar jan lokapal ke sawaal par kursi chhod kar chunaav maidan main utar jaaen, to jatke main dilli ke votaron main wo hero ban jaaenge
 But then Kejriwal's fight will be reduced to Delhi itself and the power of Delhi will come into the hands of LG through President's rule
 us vakt alji apane gavarnence se kejariwal ke daur ko maat dene kii koshish karenge or shind dilli kii satta chalaane main alji kii puri madad karenge
 Because by resigning on one side, Kejriwal's jump in the election field would mean winning a majority i
e
 at least 36 seats in the next election
 sanket saaf he kejariwal aisi haalat main alji, scindia or centre sarkaar ko gherenge
 The great thing is that he can do this work only by staying on the CM post
 to dilli kaa rasta abhi or uljhegaa kyonki kejariwal stadium main jan lokapal ko lekar vidhansabha satr na kar paane kaa thikra alji ke jarie dilli police par phod rahe hai, yani dhire-dhire takaraav charam par hoga

 In Chhattisgarh, where the Naxalites are thirsty for the blood of the jawans and have laid death for them at every step, a soldier of the state police has saved his life by giving blood to the injured Naxalites
 chhattisgarh kaa uttari kshetra sarguja main naksaliyon ne police dal par dhaava bolaa or police kii javaabi karrwai main ek inami naksali ghayal ho gaya
 But the police did not leave this Naxalite to die but got him treated and also gave him blood if needed

 On the question about saving life by giving blood to a Naxalite, the soldier Virendra Singh says that Chandrika is a human being before being a Naxalite and her first duty is to save the injured person

 shah ne vitt mantri kii chhavi ko bedaag bataate hue kaha ki bebuniyaad aarope lagaakar aam aadmi party jetali kii chhavi ko dhoomil karnaa chaahati he, lekin yah ek divaswapn he
 Amit Shah said, 'the whole nation knows the high principles with which Arun Ji has lived his public life
 agaraam aadmi partiko yah lagata he ki isse arun ji kii chhavi dhoomil hogi to wo divaswapn main he
 The BJP president said that all the allegations that AAP has made against the finance minister are all baseless and the entire BJP stands with them outright
 amit shah ne kaha ki aisa karne se aam aadmi party kaa hi nuksaan hone vaala he
 Questions raised on the inquiry commission Amit Shah has also questioned the legitimacy of the constituted inquiry commission on behalf of Kejriwal's government in the DDCA case
 shah ne kaha, 'yah puri tarah se kanoonee maamla he
 In such a situation, commission has been formed on some basis
 ' bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki kejariwal kii party vivaad khadaa kar duusare muddon se dhyaan bhatkaana chaahati he
 Jethmalani will fight on Kejriwal's side, senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani will defend Arvind Kejriwal in the court in defamation case

 baba ramdev ke shanivaar se shuru ho rahe anshan se pehle unase mahatvapurn baatcheet ke liye centre sarkaar ke kuch cabinet mantriyon ne apni tay yatraaon ko radd kar diya

 According to sources Law Minister M
 virappa moili kaa bhi mangalore jane kaa kaarykram tha lekin unhone bhi vaarta ke chalate use nirast kar diya
 Efforts are on the part of the government to persuade Ramdev to declare Satyagraha on the issue of black money and corruption
 darasal sarkaar nahin chaahati ki desh main phir se do maheene pehle ke halaat bane jab anna hajaare ne jantar mantar par bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anshan kiya tha or hajaaron log unke samarthan main sadak par utar aaye the
 Then the government had to accept Anna's demands

 indian olympic association ko anudaan dene ke sarkaar ke daawey ko ‘gumraah karne vaala’ bataate hue khel sanstha ne khel mantralay se aisa nahin karne ke liye kaha kyonki paisa bade khel aayojanon main khilaadiyon ke kharch ke liye istemaal hota he
 The Ministry claimed the grant
 The Sports Ministry does not generally provide grants to the IOA but does bear Indian team playing kits, ceremony kits, airfares and lodging expenses at the Olympics, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games
 mantralay ne 22 disambar ko jari bayaan main kaha tha ki usne 2012-13 main IOA ko anudaan ke taur par do karod 28 lakh, 48 hajaar, 524 rupye or 2014-15 main solah karod, 93 lakh,44 hajaar,359 rupye jari kiye
 IOA refutes the ministry's claim that the IOA says that the ministry has taken advantage of it to such an extent that the court has also stated that the government can enforce the ioa's Code of Sports Conduct on the basis that it gets a grant from the government
 IOA ne kaha ki vah soch rahaa he ki mantralay se khilaadiyon ke in khel aayojanon main hone vaale kharch ko unhen IOA ke marfat nahin balki vyaktigat taur par dene ke liye kahe
 IOA Secretary General Rajiv Mehta said, "this is misleading
" mantralay sarkari dastavejon main jo anudaan dikhaa rahaa he, vah in khel aayojanon main khilaadiyon par hua kharch he
 How can it be called a grant to the IOA

 idea-vodafone announced the merger on Monday
 is marjar se donon kaa india main bijness ek ho jayega
 There are five big reasons behind this
 1
 Jio Effect After coming to the market in September last year, Jio has left everyone behind in the telecom sector
 campatishan bad gaya he
 Airtel is already mixing its business with small companies due to the Jio effect
 2
 Bharti Airtel made the lowest profit in the last four years due to increased competition due to competition due to competition
 oktober-disambar ke quarter main munaafe main kaaphi kami ai
 Not only this, during this period, India's third largest player Idea Cellular also suffered losses for the first time
 3
 Airtel has already done preparations
 It is worth mentioning that Airtel has tried to strengthen itself by buying the Indian business of Norwegian company Telenor
 iske chalateadia or vodafonper or dabaav tha
 If they did not come together, their business in India would be badly affected
 4
 Wanting to be the biggest Idea and Vodafone have set a target to become the largest telecom company by combining their business
 isse donon kaa revenyu 80 hajaar karod rupye ho jayega
 5
 badhegi yugers kii sankhyavahin sabsakribers ke maamle main bhi donon ke number yugers main badhotaree hogi
 Vodafone India currently has 200 million customers
 vahiin idia ke paas 18 karod customers hai
 If both are found, they will also become the largest company in the country in terms of users
 airettle abhi number van he jiske paas 26
 There are 34 crore users

 He said that all political parties should keep away from violence
 ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue mukhyamantri ne kaha, "ham rajya main shanti chaahate hai

 congress mahasachiv ambika soni ne kaha- pok hameshaa rahaa bharat kaa hissaarthik mandi or berogari ko lekar deshvyapee andolan chalaaegi congresspurv kendriya mantri or congress mahasachiv ambika soni ne jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane ko lekar bhartiya janata party (bijepi) or modi sarkaar par karaara hamalaa bolaa he
 In Jammu, he said that the Modi government changed the identity of Jammu and Kashmir without consulting the people
 modi sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir rajya ke tukade karke logon ke saath dhokhaa kiya
 Now the youth of Jammu and Kashmir are worried about whether they will get a job or not? Congress General Secretary Ambika Soni protested against the removal of Article 370 and said that the status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir should be restored
 saath hi jammu-kashmir main vidhansabha chunaav karaae jane chahie or hiraasat main liye gaye netaaon ko reeha kiya janaa chahie
 He questioned the Modi government that Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok) has always been a part of India, so what was new done by removing Article 370? Congress will launch a nationwide agitation against the Modi government, during which Ambika Soni also raised the issue of economic recession and unemployment
 unhone kaha, 'congress party aarthik mandi or berogari ko lekar andolan chalaaegi
 We will vigorously take up the rising unemployment and rural problems
 ham riginal comprehensive economic partnership (aarasieepi) kaa virodh karte hai
 We have decided to launch a nationwide movement
 'congress netaa ambika sonine kaha ki hamaare virodh pradarshan ke baad modi sarkaar jaagegi or kadam uthaaegi
 When Ambika Soni was questioned about the election of the new Congress president, she said that Sonia Gandhi is the interim president of the Congress right now
 congress party uchit samay main agle adhyaksh kii niyukt par faisla karegi
 Anyway, this is an internal matter of our party
 maharashtra or haryana chunaav ke baad congress kaa manobal badhaais dauraan unhone haalia vidhansabha chunaavon kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki haryana or maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav ke baad hamaara manobal badha he
 The BJP has failed to form a government even after so many days of assembly election results in Maharashtra
 iske alaava jammu-kashmir congress ke adhyaksh jie mir ne kaha ki kisi sthaan kaa naam badalanaa galat he
 Sheikh Abdullah was the pioneer leader of the state and if the BJP changes the name of the stadium, then the people of Jammu and Kashmir will give it a befitting reply
 biguef ke javaanon ko kharaab khaane kii pole kholane vaale tej bahadur ko naukari se nikaal diya gaya tha
 After which, Tej Bahadur has now challenged his dismissal in the punjab-haryana High Court
 bataa den ki tej bahadur ne kharaab khaanaa parose jane par ek video banaakar soshal media par post kar diya tha
 After which that video went viral and Tej Bahadur had to lose his job
 khaane kii shikaayat karne vaale jawan kii VRS arji radd, patni ne BSF par lagaae gambhir aropabina notice naukari se nikaalacort main apane vakil espi yadav ke jariye di yachika main tej bahadur ne tark diya he ki unhone bisef se apni ichha se sevanivritti kii maang kii thi, jisaki pehle ijaajat de di gai lekin baad main ise radd karke unako bina koi notice die hi naukari se barkhaast kar diya gaya
 Earlier, in his petition, Tej Bahadur has told the court that he had complained about poor eating in October 2015 also during a military conference, but instead of taking any action on his complaint, BSF took his complaint in December 2016
 Transferred
 jis jagah par unka tabadalaa hua vahaan bhi javaanon ko behad ghatiya or kam khaanaa miltaa tha
 BSF had made serious allegations against Tej Bahadur, the affidavits submitted to HC had posted the video
 Tej Bahadur has claimed in his petition that he did not upload the video of himself serving substandard food but this prank was done by some of his colleagues
 tej pratap ke mutabik 8 janvari 2017 ko kharaab khaane kaa video kab uske saathiyon ne uske fasebuk acount par post kar diya use pataa hi nahin chalaa or kuch der main yah video viral ho gaya

 rahul gandhi ne aaj apane twitor acount kaa parichay badal liya
 Congress President removed and Congress member and MP has been written there
 unhone teen pannon kii chitthee bhi saarvajanik kar di he
 In which he has written his resignation
 ab rahul gandhi kii jagah ek maheene ke liye motilaal vora ko kaaryakari adhyaksh banaaya gaya he
 According to the Congress constitution, for some reason, the post of the president of the Congress resigns, then the senior general secretary has to assume the responsibility of the president
 tab tak jab tak kaarysmiti asthaayee adhyaksh kaa chunaav nahin karti he
 This temporary chairman is there until a permanent president is elected
 rahul gandhi congress ke adhyaksh pad par nahin lautenge
 Will never return, it is a matter of speculation but he is keeping his point
 nayaa adhyaksh koun hoga, vaastavik adhyaksh hoga yaa 'khadaauun mark' adhyaksh hoga
 At the moment, the Congress needs to understand more than Rahul's resignation
 rahul ne istipha dekar congress ko chunauti di he
 Congress did not take that challenge for the last five years
 45 dinon se bhi koi chunauti lene saamne nahin aayaa he
 There was once a leader like Jitendra Prasad who contested the post of President against Sonia Gandhi
 congress kaa yahi sankat he
 There are many states where the Congress president is there but remains on paper
 unke bheetar netaa banane kii na sambhaavna he or na banane kii koshish karte hai
 Everyone feels that one day Rahul Gandhi or Sonia Gandhi will win the election and they will become ministers
 tab tak ve raajnneeti main hone ke naam par apana or congress kaa time kaat rahe hote hai
 Run you look, Congress seems less battered by defeat, more dull
 congress ke system ne bhi uske bheetar netaa banane kii sambhaavna simit kar diya he
 Has finished it
 is vakt congress ke bache hue kshitij par koun sa aisa nazar aata he jiske bheetar party ko satta main laane kii bhukh he, jo raajnneeti ke bare main sochataa he, raajnneeti jeeta he, jiske peeche uske sahyogi khadey hai
 Everyone waits for orders coming from one place and stays in the Congress in the hope of that and leaving the Congress angry with that
 kitni aasaani se kai netaa congress chhod kar bijepi main chale gaye
 It keeps coming and going, but the discomfort of going to another party is telling that there is no Congress within the Congress worker and leader
 uski vichaardhaara bahut kamazor pad chuki he
 The remaining leaders in the party are more left for the party to go to the BJP
 unke bheetar agar congress hoti to ve rukte
 Get to know the Congress
 congress ke netaaon ko jaanate, padhate
 Actually, the process of becoming a Congress within the Congress has ended
 congress ke aam netaa nehru kaa bachaav tak nahin kar sake
 It is obvious how far they have gone through the basic books of politics while in politics
 rahul gandhi kaa istipha congress ke liye parti hone kaa mauka he
 Congress will now have to be a party
 jahaan koi netaa ubhar saktaa he, wo apni baton se raajnneeti kii nai lakeer khinch saktaa he
 The leaders who are in the Congress remain in the Congress
 unke bheetar congress kam dikhaati detii he
 The Congress dream is not visible
 congress daftar ke kamare or kursiyaan dikhaai detii hai
 Basically, today the Congress has become a lazy party
 uske bheetar rachanaatmaka kii kami dikhaai detii he
 It does not have politically constructive programs to keep activists and leaders busy as Parsi
 darbar main netaa banane kii jagah maidan main netaa banane kii chunauti ai he
 The Congress should see how many leaders from within it went to another party and even today they are restless to go to another party
 congress ko sochna chahie ki uski party main aise logon kii bharmaar kyon he jisamen congress hi nahin he
 The idea of the idea of india that Rahul Gandhi talks about, how many leaders are there in his party, how many such leaders are there who can take their idea of idea in public, can speak two lines among the public
 isliye rahul ke istife ke baad bhi congress ke netaa peeche hat rahe hai
 Perhaps he is less confident of being a Congressman or less confident of the Congress
 congress party ko rahul gandhi kaa vikalp nahin khojna he, use raajnneeti kaa rasta khojna he
 What must have been the year of 1929, when Jawaharlal Nehru became the president at the session of Lahore when he was 40 years old
 1947 tak congress ke 45 adhyaksh ban chuke the
 Between 1885 and 1947, he changed the president 58 times
 tab congress ek jeevant raajnneetik party thi
 To become president of 45 people means becoming and emerging a leader of different talents from time to time
 har adhyaksh apni nai soch lekar aayaa
 Brought new talent
 koi aakar fail hua to koi aakar paas hua
 Today that process has stopped
 agar band nahin hui hoti to congress main rahul kaa vikalp turant mil jaataa
 The party may not be able to find it but the public or the worker would see that it could be our president instead of Rahul
 kya aapako koi awaz sunai detii he
 Today, at the age of 90, Motilal Vora became the acting president for a month
 18 saal ke the jab bharat azaad hua tha
 The question is whether the president of the Congress will be a new person who will also be young or someone will be 70 years old
 priyanka gandhi hongi yaa koi aisi pratibha he jise congress sarprize ke rup main pesh kar sakati he
 Rahul Gandhi accepted his responsibility in his resignation
 congress kaarysmiti ke sadasyon se aagrah kiya he ki ve kuch logon kaa group banaaen or nae adhyaksh kii talash shuru karen
 Rahul Gandhi has written that as president he is responsible for the 2019 defeat
 party ke bhavishya ke liye javabdehi zaruri he
 For this reason, he has resigned from the Congress post
 unhone likhaa he dusron kii bhi javabdehi tay karne kii zarurat he, lekin yah kaise ho saktaa he ki adhyaksh kii javabdehi na ho
 In this letter, Rahul has written that my struggle has never been an ordinary battle for political power
 mujhe bhaajapa ke prati koi nafatar yaa gussa nahin he lekin mere sharir main maujuud koon kaa ek ek qataraa sahaj rup se bharat ke prati bijepi ke vichaar kaa pratirodh karti he
 This resistance arises because the existence of India which i imagine is in conflict with bjp's imagination
 yah koi nai ladaai nahin he
 Continued on this earth for thousands of years
 jahaan ve matbhed dekhte hai main samanta dekhtaa hum
 Where they see hatred, i see love
 jahaan ve bhay dekhte hai main gale lagaataa hum
 This is the idea of india that we will protect
 desh or samvidhan par ho rahaa hamalaa hamaare desh ke taane-bane ko nasht karne ke liye ho rahaa he
 i am not backing down from this fight in any way
 mai congress kaa nishthavan sipaahi hum or bharat kaa ek samarpit betaa hum
 i will continue to serve and protect him till my last breath
 ek raajnneetik dal ke netaa kaaryakarta or purv adhyaksh hone ke naate rahul gandhi ne apane vichaar to likhe hai lekin kya vaaki congress ke netaa or congress adhyaksh ke naate rahul gandhi is vichaar ke liye sangharsh kar rahe the
 Of course he was talking about love in his speeches, but was that enough
 kya ve un sawaalon ko us samay ho rahi raajnneeti kaa sidhaa-sidhaa jawaab de rahe the
 Were the majority and minorities going to the neighborhoods on the question of communalism, challenging the politics of hate in front
 congress kaa koun sa netaa tha jo idia aaf india ke vichaaron ko lekar rashtriya str par jujh rahaa tha, yaa phir vah naram hindutv se koi jugad bitha rahaa tha
 Is it not right that in the last several elections, the politics of the Congress had become staggered by the minorities, fearing that it would not be polarized
 dhuvikaran kii raajnneeti ke khilaaf congress kahaan or kab sangharsh karti nazar ai
 What is in this paper, why is it not against the BJP in field politics
 rahul kyon akele ladate rahe, or lade to us vakt ection kyon nahin le rahe the jab unki party ke duusare netaa unhen is ladaai main akelaa chhod rahe the
 It has been written in this letter that the Congress fought the elections reliably and decently
 maine khud nijee rup se pradhanmantri, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or unke dwaara kabzaaye gaye sansthaaon ke khilaaf ladaai ladi
 i fought because i love India
 kai baar main puri tarah akelaa khadaa tha or muje is par garv he
 a president had to say that if he continued to fight alone, it means that there is no Congress left within the Congress
 bachi hoti to vah apane adhyaksh ke liye ladati
 The question is also whether they have the ability to fight and the moral strength
 jawaab aap jaanate hai
 Quaid can be asked whether any Congress leader felt ashamed after reading this part of Rahul's letter
 iske aage unhone likhaa he ki ek swatantra or nishpaksh chunaav ke liye kisi desh ke sansthaanon kii nishpakshta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 An election cannot take place without an independent press, an independent judiciary and a transparent election commission
 na hi ek chunaav swatantra ho saktaa he, agar ek party kaa vittiya sansadhano par puraa ekadhikaar ho jaae
 In the 2019 election, our fight was not with a political party
 balki hamane puri sarkari mashinari se ladaai ladi, jiskaa har santhaan vipaksh ke khilaaf tha
 It is now clear that the neutrality of our institutions is over
 hamaare desh kii sansthagat sanrachana par kabza karne vaale rashtareey swanyasevak sangh ke ghoshit uddeshy ab puure ho chuke hai
 a real danger is that from now on, elections will remain a formality rather than deciding India's future
 rahul gandhi ne likhaa he ki jeet ke baad bhi pradhanmantri par lage bhrashtachar ke aarope khatm nahin ho jate hai
 Neither money nor propaganda can hide the truth
 bharat ko ek hona hona apni sansthaaon kii tatasthta ko phir se behaal karne ke liye
 The Congress will be the architect of its unity
 lekin iske liye congress ko puri tarah se badalanaa hona
 Rahul wants Congress to change, Congress wants Rahul to change a bit more
 congress ko congress pehle bananaa hoga
 Then the issue of the Speaker is not such a big issue
 jab ek party hoti he to usamen se netaa aa hi jaataa he
 Congress is not a party at this time
 yah meri raay he
 To which i agree
 trinmul congress kii saansad mahua moitra ne loksabhaa main bhaashan diya to uski khub charchaa hui
 But later news began to appear that his speech was stolen from somewhere
 twitor se ye nautanki shuru hui or bataaya jane laga ki mahua moitra ne washington manthali ke martin longmain ke lekh se apana bhaashan churaayaa
 The TV anchors did programs on it
 lekin aaj martin laungmain jinhone washington manthali main likhaa tha, unhone twit kiya he ki main bharat main kaaphi fasam ho gaya hum kyonki ek rajaneta par galat aarope lag rahe hai ki unhone mere lekh se chori kii he
 This is a very funny thing
 lekin dakshinpanthi murkh har desh main ek jaise hi hote hai
 Efforts were made to put an end to the credibility of the speech of Mahua Mitra which was becoming popular
 ab aapako koi nahin batayega ki washington manthali ke martin ne mahua moitra ko bedaag bataaya he
 It will continue against Mohua even after this
 yahi pattern he
 On the other hand, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her written reply in Rajya Sabha that corruption has increased after demonetisation
 isse kisi ko ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he kyonki vitt mantri ne yah nahin kaha ki bhrashtachar ko mitaane ke liye phir notebandi karenge
 You know that there were some reasons behind demonetisation
 yahi ki nagdi kaa chalan bad gaya he, isamen jaali note hai, yah bhrashtachar kaa paisa he
 Rampreet Mandal, JD (U) MP from Jhanjharpur in Bihar, asked the question whether demonetisation has reduced corruption or not
 november 2016 se nagdi ke chalan main vruddhi hui he
 As on November 4, 2016, the total value of the notes was Rs 17,741 billion
 29 march 2019 ke anusaar parichaalan karency kaa mulya 21, 137
 64 billion rupees
 aarthik samiksha 2016-17 main likhaa he ki duniya bhar main nakadi or galat kaaryakalapon ke bich gaharaa rishta paaya jaataa he
 According to Transparency International's assessment, the higher the cash in circulation, the higher the corruption
 vitt mantri ne jis transperency international kii report kaa zikr kiya he uske anusaar 2017 or 2018 ke bich bharat main rishwatakhori 11 pratishat bad gai thi
 However, the Prime Minister claimed that corruption has ended

 On the other hand, drought in Chennai is starting to bring a different type of crisis
 bijness standard main ek reporch he
 People from a village 32 miles away from Chennai captured a tanker
 unka aarope he ki gaanv kaa pani shaharon ko diya ja rahaa he
 a villager has written a letter to the government that private tankers have installed more than 8 borewells in his village
 vahaan se pani niklaa kar chennai ke hotalon main pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 The water of the village is starting to decrease

 Many big stars, including Sajid Khan, Anu Malik and Kailash Kher, came up in this campaign
 actress kangana ranut or taapasi pannu ke bich kaa ek vivaad charchaa main he
 The controversy started with the praise of the trailer of Kangana's film 'judicial Hai Kya', which is slowly growing
 ab tak vivaad main kangana kii bahan rangoli chandel bol rahi thim, par ab khud kangana ne taapasi ko riekshans ke liye taiyaar rahane kii salaah de daali he
 Actually, after watching the trailer of Kangana and Rajkummar Rao starrer film 'judicial Hai Kya', Taapsee Pannu praised the trailer without naming the film's cast
 is par kangana kii bahan rangoli ne taapasi par nishaanaa sadhate hue twit kiya tha
 He called Taapsee a cheap copy
 is par jab taapasi se sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha tha ki unke paas in sab chizon ke liye vakt nahin he
 Earlier, in support of Tapasi, director Anurag Kashyap had asked Rangoli to stop all this
 rangoli ne bhi taapasi ke ek intervyuu video ko post karte hue bataaya ki isamen taapasi ne kaha tha ki kangana ko dabl filter kii jarurat he
 Kuch log Kangana ko copy kar ke he apni dukaan chalate hain, magar pls note, they never acknowledge her not even a mention of her name in praising the trailer, last i heard Taapsee ji said Kangana needs a double filter and Tapsee ji you need to stop being a sasti copy 🙏https: / / t

 unhone taapasi pannu ko salaah dete hue kaha, "vah (taapasi) apmanjanak chijen kahati hai jaise mujhe dabl filter kii jarurat he yaa main nepotism par chillaati hum

 About 200 sex workers from Mumbai have arrived in Ayodhya to hear Morari Bapu's Ram Katha, due to which a group is unhappy and is questioning their presence in this religious city
 shivasena ke ek netaa kehete hai ki is baar to ham log unhen katha karne de rahe hai, lekin aage se unhen ayodhya main katha kii ijaajat nahin hogi, sadakon par baari virodh hoga
 Actually, Morari Bapu, the famous Ramkatha reader, has kept the theme of his story 'ganika' in Ayodhya this time
 ganika yani 'nagar-vadhoo'
 The female dancers of the infamous streets or in common language are called sex workers
 is theme par pehali baar ramakatha kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa or vah bhi ayodhya main
 Morari Bapu for the first time in his Ramakatha has taken reference to the Ganakas and expressed the society's relationship with the Ganesha and the society's disdain by citing the Ramacharitmanas, the Ramayana as well as other scriptural passages
 mumbai se ek enjio ke saath ai ye ganikaayen morari baapu kii ramakatha main har roj vakt se aati hai or baithti hai, lekiyodhyaake kuch log morari baapu kii katha main sex workars ko laae jane par sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 Local astrologer Pandit Praveen Sharma said, 'I will protest against the gathering of the girls in Ayodhya
 aadambar or rupee kaa aayojan thik nahin he
 If the girls had to improve, they would have collected money for them and given them
 agar vah swechha se ai hotin to thik tha
 It is a wrong thing to invite you
 ayodhya ke log sex workars se parichit nahin the
 Morari Bapu has polluted the atmosphere of Ayodhya
 'agali baar aane nahin dengeh shivasenaganikaon kyodhyaalae jane par shivasena ke netaa santosh dube ne niraashaa jaahir karte hue kaha, 'ganikaon or sex workars kaa main bhi virodh kar rahaa hum
 It is not mentioned anywhere in the Ramcharit Manas
 maine puri ramayana padhi he or kahin bhi ganikaon kaa zikr nahin he
 i think Morari Bapu has gone astray
 aap jo kaam kar rahe the vah acha kaam tha, yah acha kaam nahin he
 The term sex worker will never be accepted
 ab saare varkar samaj main aate hai lekin sex varkar samaj nahin aata
 He further said that if you want to improve then go and improve in Mumbai, if you want to improve, then improve the Naxalites who are killing people
 aap pakistan parast aatankiyon ko sudhaaren
 Which place is Ayodhya to improve girls? ayodhyaake sant dakshina kii vajah se maun dhaaran kar baithe hai or koi kuch nahin bol rahaa
 i think Morari Babu was affected by age
 is baar to ham log unhen katha karne de rahe hai, lekin aage se unhen ayodhya main katha kii ijaajat nahin hogi, sadakon par baari virodh hoga
 On the other hand, Morari Bapu is constantly referring to these sex workers in his fiction despite constant opposition
 apane katha ke jariye inke halaat ke bare main samaaj ke saamne rakh rahe hai or samaaj ko sex workars ke kalyaan ke liye sochane par majaboor kar rahe hai
 Satyendra Das, the priest of Ramjanmabhoomi said, 'while some people are in opposition in Ayodhya, most of the saints and saints are in support of calling the women in the script of Morari Bapu
 ayodhya ke jitne bhi bade sant hai, sabhi morari baapu ke is kadam ke saath hai or unka samarthan kar rahe hai
 'commendable step: Swami Paramhanshah, while supporting the call of Swami Paramhansasex workers, says that there are two types of protesters who either do not have knowledge of the scriptures or who are not getting attention
 morari baapu ne jo kadam uthaaya he vah behad saraahneey he or jo log coment kar rahe hai wo hamaare itihaas or aadhyatm ko nahin jaanate
 Dattatreya, the 24th Guru of God, was also a teacher
 hamaare yahaan isaki parampara bhi milti he
 It is a very commendable step to bring the girls into the Ramakatha and everybody welcomes it and everyone should welcome it
 virodh karne vaale nindaneey he
 If someone's character is good by listening to Ramkatha, then it should be absolutely and all the courtesans who have come here are welcome
 haalanki, ayodhya ke aam logon ne is kadam ko saraahneey mana or morari baapu dwaara unhen khaastaur par bulaae jane ke faisle se sahamat dikhaai dete hai
 According to him, this is a very good step for social reform and no matter how much opposition there is, it should not be taken back

 Former Chief Justice R
 si
 His condemnation of Lahoti is reprehensible
 phir bhi, unke aaropon kii andekhi nahin kii ja sakati
 His revelations in an English daily reveal that Chief Justice Lahoti changed his mind knowing the Prime Minister's concerns
 ab agar yah kaha jaae ki unhone pradhanmantri ke sammaan main aisa kiya, to ise swikaarna mushkil hoga
 Institutions should work together and, as far as possible, to build consensus
 sarvocchata aakhri aujaar hi honi chahie
 Not that he should be waved like a pocket knife
 jab unke collegium ne hi ek jaj ko behaal rakhane kaa prastaav thukraa diya ho, aisi sthiti main kya lahoti main sansthaaon ko lekar samvedansheeltaa honi chahie thi, yahi sawaal ab unke pichley bartaav ke moolyankan kaa tarika ho saktaa he
 Whether or not the Prime Minister can make any request to the Chief Justice of the country, it is not the job of insignificant people like us to check the rationale
 unke bartaav par yaa to sansad sawaal uthaa sakati he yaa phir tivi channelon ke anker!hycourt or supreme court ke nyaayadhishon ko jaise baari adhikaar hasil hai, uske maddenjar asal masalaa yah he ki in padon par sarvshereshth ke alaava kisi or kii niyukti kii gunjaaish hi nahin banati he
 Nevertheless, if this arrangement allows a suspect (whether right or wrong) to remain a judge, it needs to be seriously reconsidered
 yahaan angreji kii vah kahawat yaad rakhi jaani chahie ki “raja kii patni ko har andeh se pare hona chahie
 "moreover, a system in which the position of the Chief Justice can be disputed as it is today must undoubtedly be changed
 jaj kii niyukti ke liye jaruri he ki aise shaks kii talash kii jaae jo kanoon kaa pandit ho, jiskaa rahan-sahan takreeban saadhuon jaisaa, charitra santon jaisaa or jigyaasa va vinamrata kanoon ke vidhyaarthee jaisi ho
 Appointment of judges of Supreme Court and High Court from among lawyers requires evaluation of their legal talent and character
 vakeelon kii kanoonee pratibha to adaalaton main jaj parakh sakate hai lekin unke charitra kii jaankaree jutaney ke tareeke unke paas nahin hote
 For this reason, confidential reports of the candidates have been prepared from the Intelligence Bureau (IB)
 sarkaar kii bhoomika ab ibi kii report collegium ko bhejne tak simit kar di gai he
 Perhaps the result of completely excluding the executive from this process is that such ineligible appointments are also made through people who are not fully informed
 aakhir, jajon kii niyukti ke bare main faisla koun kare? khud nyaaypalika kare, karypalika kare, donon milakar karen yaa phir, niyukti kaa maamla kisi swatantra sanstha ke jimme ho? samvidhan main to yahi likhaa he ki jajon kii niyukti raashtrapati (yani karypalika) supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish or (hycourt ke jajon ke maamle main) hycourt ke mukhya nyaayadhish kii salaah se karen
 In the Sankalchand Seth case (when an eminent judge was transferred in the black era of Emergency for reasons unknown), the Supreme Court upheld the supremacy of the executive in the matter of appointment and transfer of judges
 yahi raay es
 P
 gupta maamle ke faisle ke dauraan bhi doharaai gai, jise jajon kaa maamla kaha jaataa he
 The Supreme Court was forced to interpret the law relating to appointments to the judiciary afresh due to the increasing persistence and misconduct of the executive in the changed process years and made such an interpretation that the Chief Justice gained supremacy
 uske mutabik supreme court ke jajon kii collegium siforishein karegi, sarkaar apane vichaar rakhegi or yadi usne prastaavit niyukti par aapatti kii, tab collegium us par vichaar karegi or antim nirnay legi
 If the collegium turns down the objection, then the government will have no choice but to appoint the proposed person as a judge
 maujuuda maamle main dekhen to vyavhaar main hua yah he ki mukhya nyaayadhish ne pradhanmantri karyaalay ke anurodh par apane collegium kii raay badal di
 The collegium system has come under criticism over the past decade

 The Supreme Court in 1993 defended its decision to shift the process of appointment of judges from the executive to focus on judges and thus make radical changes in the interpretation of the constitutional provision, stating that the Constitution is a vibrant document and should be interpreted as such Serve the larger purpose of ensuring an independent judiciary
 is prasthaapana main koi dikkat nahin he ki sanvaidhanik loktantr main nyaaypalika ko rajnatik dabaavon se mukt rahanaa chahie
 The question is how to achieve this
 1950 se 1993 tak karypalika kii sarvocchata ke baavjood kuch behtareen nyaayadhishon ne hamaari adaalaton kaa maan badhaayaa he

 In contrast, the current system has been unable to prevent the appointment of judges who did not even have the basic character of a judge, and some of whom, in the words of Lord Atkin, were of a more executive-minded mindset
 kaha ja saktaa he ki donon hi vyavasthaaon kii apni khamiyaan hai
 The current controversy over appointment appointments underscores the need that the system of appointment of judges should be reconsidered
 iske liye tamaam aise model hai jin par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 India's experience shows that executive supremacy is not suitable for us Indians
 nyaayik sarvocchata bhi utani hi trutipurna sabit hui he
 We need a permanent institution (something like the Public Service Commission) to sort out a list of candidates and have a high-powered committee to select from that list which consists of judges, political representatives and some of the most eminent people in the country
 sthaayee sanstha ke paas aisa tantra hona chahie jisase vah shreshth logon ko chhaant sake
 He should have a system whereby he can gather information about the character and background of the candidates and there should be professionals who can check the accuracy of the candidate's personality
 duusare, jajon kaa kaarykaal kisi bhi tarah se kam nahin kiya ja saktaa, haalanki sansthagat pranali ke paas aise adhikaar hone chahie ki unke khilaaf aaropon kii jaanch kii ja sake or yadi ve anupyukt paae gaye, to unhen hataaya bhi ja sake
 The current ways of whispering news and leaking news in the media have shaken the confidence of common people in the integrity of the judicial system
 isi ke saath, karypalika ko aise adhikaar nahin die ja sakate ki vah jajon par apana danda chalaa sake
 The constitutional system of impeachment has failed
 sandigdh jaj ko ek adaalat se duusari main sthanantarit karnaa samasya ko ek adaalat se duusari main bhejne jaisaa he
 There is another suggestion that can be debated — should the quality of judges be evaluated periodically so that unwanted elements can be removed? Apart from this, the judges should also have a forum where they can register their complaints, for which there is no need to run to the Law Minister
 nyaaypalika na to thilishahon par lagaam laga sakati he, na hi uske paas koi baahubal he
 Nevertheless, his words and instructions are respected by the most powerful governments, because he gains strength from the vast ocean of public opinion
 pakistan main raashtrapati parvej musharraf ko nyaaypalika se chhedchhad kii acchhee-khaasi keemat chukaani padi thi
 No government in India will ever contempt the contempt of the Supreme Court
 bas shart itani he ki nyaaypalika ko lekar janata kii dharna majboot bani rahe
 If it was harmed so much that it would be difficult to rectify, it would mean the end of the legitimacy of the courts and their confession
 phir bhartiya loktantr kaa ant bhi bahut dur nahin rah jayega

 Even though Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to immortalise Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his birthday by issuing a coin of 100 rupees in his name, but to make the memory of Vajpayee unforgettable in reality But what should be done could not be done
 vaajapeyi kaa paitruk gaanv bateshwar abhi bhi prastaavit bhavy smarak kii baat joh rahaa he
 In fact, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had promised to make the ancestral village of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Vateshwar an 'ideal village'
 iske saath hi unhone vaajapeyi kii 'asthi visarjan yatra' ke samaapan par bateshwar gaanv main unki yaad main bhavy smarak banane kaa bhi vaada kiya tha lekin vaajapeyi kaa gaanv abhi bhi yogi ke vaade ke puraa hone kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 It is worth mentioning that after the death of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, all the Chief Ministers of BJP had taken out a 'bone immersion journey' in their own state to make their ashes flow across the country
 isi kram main alag-alag mukhyamantriyon ne apane rajya main vaajapeyi kii yaad main tamaam ghoshnaaen kii thim
 Bhagwan Singh of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's ancestral village Bateshwar says that the Chief Minister had made many promises three months ago, but nothing could be done in this direction, even the roads leading to Bateshwar are in a shambles
 vikaas ke naam par na hi bateshwar or na hi bah tehsil ko kuch mila
 Vapeyi's ancestral residence has turned into ruins and acacia trees have grown in broken walls
 lagata he ki mukhyamantri ke vaade bhi vaajapeyi kii asthiyon ke saath yamuna main visarjeet ho gaye
 Congress leader Shabbir Abbas said that Atal Bihari Vajpayee is respected by leaders of all political parties
 yah dekhte hue dukh hota he ki vaajapeyi kii maut ko raajnneetik phaayde ke liye media sarkas bana diya gaya
 Like PM Modi's jumle, the development of Bateshwar at the cost of Rs 25 crore also became a BJP jumla
 lekin log is jhooth ko samajhate hai or logon ko bevakoof samajhane ke liye janata bijepi ko sajaa jarur degi

 Manoj Bajpayee told that i had learned the way of speaking of Bhikhu from my cook
 meraa bawarchi kolhapur kaa rahane vaala tha
 When Satya was told the film was the biggest mistake, Manoj Vajpayee said that within a week of the release of the film Satya, the film was declared as the biggest mistake because only 15-20 people came to watch it
 lekin achaanak darshakon kii sankhya badhane lagi or aise kai cinema haul, jinhone film utaar di thi, unhone iskaa pradarshan phir shuru kar diya

 In this era, communalism is coming in different brand forms
 lav, jihad, aabaadi kaa khoff, go maance,dharmik jhande ko pakistani bataanaa, palaayan, go raksha
 These are all different versions of that brand
 jaise toothpaste ke alag-alag brands ho sakate hai

 Nationalism is the name of that corporation

 Go Raksha sometimes nationalism
 ab ise bechney ke liye use kiraanaa store bhi chahie or super mal bhi, jiskaa naam he media
 When it can launch a brand of toothpaste separately, it can also launch media
 vahaan bhi aakaa ek hi he magar unke channel kai hai
 Now it is happening that the cover of nationalism is being offered to sell communalism in the media shop

 Someone who is playing this game

 Nationalism which is full ie those who have a paste in their tube, what have they done? One of its biggest campaigns was launched, which is still in launch stage
 svachh bharat abhiyaan
 Two years ago, many politicians, activists and actors used to tweet a lot with a broom
 twitor par nau ratna niyukt karte the ki ye bhi safai karenge tabhi desh saaf hoga
 It was said that nothing will happen to the government alone
 sabko aage aana hoga
 Where are those people today? Where are the 9 gems of Twitter? Where is the cleanliness drive? Where is the nationalistic feeling that these people were spraying the charanamrit that now we are going to be clean and tidy
 jo log aae the unka rashtrawaad kyon thanda pad gaya? do saal main to wo apni puri colony saaf kar dete
 Did they stop looking at the anchors who have been given the task of collecting toll tax of nationalism? svachh bharat abhiyaan ke tahat nai dilli ke balmiki mandir ke paas anokhaa shauchalay bana
 Did that toilet be kept somewhere else in Delhi? If this is so, at least one hundred fifty such toilets must have been kept in Delhi in two years? Do you see Do you see such trash, dustbins in the mohallas of Delhi or in any of your cities that have been kept under this campaign? Are they clean? Keeping one or two dustbins is not talking about Khanapurti
 agar kahin ye safal bhi hoga to inhen sab vyavasthaaon ke durust hone kii vajah se na ki twitor par chaaye gaali gundon ke rashtrawaad se
 The meaning of this story is that nationalism is not the cause of your problem
 swatchta abhiyaan isliye fel hua kyonki dilli ko saaf karne ke liye kai hajaar safai karmchaaree kii zarurat thi
 What got admitted? There are reports of non-payment of salaries of the existing employees

 Now you should not ask such questions, so your arrangement has been made

 Why is his salary not fifty thousand? aap jo tivi par ankaron ke marfat us agyaat vyakti kii mahatvakanksha ke liye rache ja rahe tamaashe ko patrakarita samaj rahe hai wo darasal kuch or hai
 You are being dragged daily in your name in the name of nationalism so that you do not question its name
 daal kii keemat par baat na karen yaa mahangi fees kii charchaa na karen
 That is why nationalism camps are being created in the media
 ankar sarkaar se kah rahaa he ki wo patrakaron par deshadroh kaa muqadama chalaae
 The day the journalist turned to the government, understand that the government has turned against the public

 Now it has been relaunched on the pretext of Kashmir! mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne kaha he ki burhan vaani ko chhod diya jaataa agar sena ko pataa hota ki vah burhan he
 Mehbooba, a BJP ally, did not even call Burhan a terrorist and if she is, then why does she not talk about killing him as nationalists do
 mahabuuba mufti ne to sena se ek badi kamyaabi kaa shrey bhi le liya ki usne anjaane main maar diya
 Now even the pride of the army has become cocky
 kya mahabuuba mufti ko giraftaar kar deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya jaae? kya ankar log ye bhi maang karenge? kis haq se patrakaron ke khilaaf deshadroh kaa muqadama chalaane kii baat kar rahe hai? jis sarkaar ke dam par wo kud rahe hai kya wo sarkaar aisa karegi ki mahabuuba ko barkhaast kar degi? kya us sarkaar kaa koi bada mahabuuba se yah bayaan waapas karvaa legaa?tippaniyan Therefore, look at politics as politics

 To know this, if you come to watch TV at 9 o'clock every night, then you have itching, not nationalism
 neem hakim jisaki dawa zaalim loshan bataate hai
 i give you a free advice
 channelon ke liye aapkaa cabel par har maheene teen se paanch sau rupaya kharch hota hoga
 When you have to take a pill of hate between Hindus and Muslims under the guise of nationalism by paying five hundred rupees, then you cut the cable
 jab aapane nafrat thaan hi lee he to kijiye nafrat
 Why are five hundred cable and five hundred junk newspapers giving for this? Save your one thousand! to aap se guzarish he ki raajnneeti or rashtrawaad main fark kijiye
 This is not the nationalism you are understanding
 yah rashtrawaad ke naam par sampradayikta he, jo aap dekhnaa hi nahin chaahate
 Nationalism is the new name of communalism
 zarurat he rashtrawaad ko sampradayikta se bachaane kii or tivi kam dekhne kii
 The common man will understand this late, but by then he will be so caught in the ranks of political camps that it will be difficult to get out

 To know this, if you come to watch TV at 9 o'clock every night, then you have itching, not nationalism
 neem hakim jisaki dawa zaalim loshan bataate hai
 i give you a free advice
 channelon ke liye aapkaa cabel par har maheene teen se paanch sau rupaya kharch hota hoga
 When you have to take a pill of hate between Hindus and Muslims under the guise of nationalism by paying five hundred rupees, then you cut the cable
 jab aapane nafrat thaan hi lee he to kijiye nafrat
 Why are five hundred cable and five hundred junk newspapers giving for this? Save your one thousand! to aap se guzarish he ki raajnneeti or rashtrawaad main fark kijiye
 This is not the nationalism you are understanding
 yah rashtrawaad ke naam par sampradayikta he, jo aap dekhnaa hi nahin chaahate
 Nationalism is the new name of communalism
 zarurat he rashtrawaad ko sampradayikta se bachaane kii or tivi kam dekhne kii
 In this era, communalism is coming in different brand forms
 lav, jihad, aabaadi kaa khoff, go maance,dharmik jhande ko pakistani bataanaa, palaayan, go raksha
 These are all different versions of that brand
 jaise toothpaste ke alag-alag brands ho sakate hai
 Patanjali, Colgate, Miswak, Pepsodent toothpaste are communalism
 ise banane vaala koi karporation bhi hoga
 Nationalism is the name of that corporation
 yah alag-alag naam se usee ek toothpaste ko bech rahaa he
 Go Raksha sometimes nationalism
 ab ise bechney ke liye use kiraanaa store bhi chahie or super mal bhi, jiskaa naam he media
 When it can launch a brand of toothpaste separately, it can also launch media
 vahaan bhi aakaa ek hi he magar unke channel kai hai
 Now it is happening that the cover of nationalism is being offered to sell communalism in the media shop
 itane saare toothpaste hai, koi koun-sa vaala kharidega, iskaa bhi ilaaj he
 Training to say the same thing to the well-to-do anchors or to the well-to-do anchors
 aap kabhi to sochie ki media rashtrawaad ko lekar itnaa ugr kyon ho rahaa he? kyon har baar sena or seemaa ke naam par ye rashtrawaad ubhaara jaataa he? kyon jab ye thanda padataa he to go raksha aa jaataa he? go raksha pit jaataa he to rashtrawaad aa jaataa he? is ladaai ko aap bhale hi chand ankaron ke bich kaa maamla samajhen lekin aisa he nahin
 Someone who is playing this game
 koi he jisaki raajnneetik mahatvakanksha ke liye yah khel khelaa ja rahaa he uskaa cheharaa aap kabhi nahin dekh paaenge kyonki mahakarporation kiske ishaare par chalata he, uskaa cheharaa koi nahin dekh paata he
 Only people are counted and dead bodies are buried
 puri duniya main aisa hi chalan he
 Nationalism which is full ie those who have a paste in their tube, what have they done? One of its biggest campaigns was launched, which is still in launch stage
 svachh bharat abhiyaan
 Two years ago, many politicians, activists and actors used to tweet a lot with a broom

 Where are those people today? Where are the 9 gems of Twitter? Where is the cleanliness drive? Where is the nationalistic feeling that these people were spraying the charanamrit that now we are going to be clean and tidy

 To know this, if you come to watch TV at 9 o'clock every night, then you have itching, not nationalism
 neem hakim jisaki dawa zaalim loshan bataate hai
 i give you a free advice
 channelon ke liye aapkaa cabel par har maheene teen se paanch sau rupaya kharch hota hoga
 When you have to take a pill of hate between Hindus and Muslims under the guise of nationalism by paying five hundred rupees, then you cut the cable
 jab aapane nafrat thaan hi lee he to kijiye nafrat
 Why are five hundred cable and five hundred junk newspapers giving for this? Save your one thousand! to aap se guzarish he ki raajnneeti or rashtrawaad main fark kijiye
 This is not the nationalism you are understanding
 yah rashtrawaad ke naam par sampradayikta he, jo aap dekhnaa hi nahin chaahate
 Nationalism is the new name of communalism
 zarurat he rashtrawaad ko sampradayikta se bachaane kii or tivi kam dekhne kii
 Now it needs a grocery store to sell it and also a super mall, named Media
 jab vah toothpaste kaa brands alag-alag launch kar saktaa he to media kaa bhi launch kar saktaa he
 There is only one boss, but his channels are many
 ab ho yah rahaa he ki madia kii dukaan main sampradayikta bechney ke liye rashtrawaad kaa cover chadhaaya ja rahaa he
 There are so many toothpastes, which one will buy, which is also a treatment
 ek hi baat kehane vaale bhaanti-bhaanti ke ankar yaa bhaanti-bhaanti ke ankaron ko ek hi baat kehane kaa prashikshan
 Do you ever wonder why the media is becoming so fierce about nationalism? Why is this nationalism raised every time in the name of army and border? Why does cow protection come when it gets cold? Nationalism comes when cow gets beaten? You may consider this fight as a matter between a few anchors, but it is not so
 koi he jo yah khel khel rahaa he
 You will never see the face of someone whose political ambition is being played for this game, because no one can see the face of whose corporation runs at the behest
 sirf log gine jate hai or laashen dafanaai jaati hai
 Such is the trend all over the world
 rashtrawaad jinamein bharpoor he yani jinke tub main paste bharaa he unhone kya kar liya? iskaa ek sabase bada abhiyaan launch hua tha, jo aaj bhi launch avasthaa main hi he
 Clean India Movement
 do saal purv bahut se netaa, kaaryakarta, abhinayta jhaadu lekar khub twit karte the
 Nine gems were appointed on Twitter that the country will be clean only when they do cleanliness
 kaha gaya ki akele sarkaar se kuch nahin hoga
 Everyone has to come forward
 aaj vah log kahaan hai? twitor ke nau ratna kahaan hai? swatchta abhiyaan kahaan he? wo rashtravaadi bhaavana kahaan he jise lekar ye log charnamrita chhidak rahe the ki ab ham saaf suthra hone vaale hai
 Why did the nationalism of those who came reduced to cold? In two years, he would have cleaned his entire colony
 kya unhone un ankaron ko dekhnaa chhod diya jinhen rashtrawaad kaa toll tex vasuulne kaa kaam diya gaya he? Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a unique toilet was constructed near the Balmiki temple in New Delhi
 kya dilli main vaisaa shauchalay or bhi kahin rakhaa gaya? aisa he to do saal main dilli main kam se kam sau pachaas aise shauchalay to rakhe hi gaye honge? kya aapako dikhte hai? kya aapako dilli ke mohallon main yaa apane kisi shahar main aise shochaalay, koodaydaan dikhte hai jo is abhiyaan ke tahat rakhe gaye hon? unki saaf safai hoti he? ek yaa do koodaydaan rakh khanaapurti kii baat nahin kar rahaa
 Even if it will succeed, it is due to the correctness of all these systems and not the nationalism of the abusive goons who are on Twitter
 is kahani kaa matlab yah hua ki aapaki samasya kii vajah rashtrawaad main kami nahin he
 The cleanliness campaign failed because thousands of sanitation workers were needed to clean Delhi
 kya bhartee hui? jo maujuuda karmchaaree hai unheen kaa vetan na milane kii khabaren aati rahati hai
 He even threw garbage on the streets of Delhi for his salary
 ab aap is tarah ke sawaal na puch baithen isliye aapkaa intazaam kiya gaya he
 Issues that are directly related to communalism or nationalism are constantly being presented
 ye isliye ho rahaa he ki aap hameshaa kaalpanik duniya main rahane lage, vaise rahete bhi hai
 Someone who understands you well
 yahi ki aap sar nicha kiye smart phone par biji hai
 a game has arrived on these smart phones
 pokemaun
 As you play, you will find cleanliness in your locality
 hamaara sainik kyon atharah hazaar masik paata he? kya saansad vidhayak kaa vetan ek sainik se zyaada hona chahie? sainikon par to kam se kam seemaa par khadey-khadey desh luutane kaa ilzaam nahin he
 They die
 vidhayakon saansadon main se kitne jail gaye or kitne or ja sakate hai magar inase sarkarein banati hai or chalati hai
 Where is Gangotri in his immense fund? If you have to worry about nationalism, then say that why does the general returning on leave from the border go to the bogey or to the second class? Why is the AC train not booked for him? Why did his child study in a school whose master went to census
 uski selary pachaas hazaar kyon nahin he? Through the anchors on TV, you are considering journalism to create a spectacle for the ambition of that unknown person
 aapako rose khinch-khinchakar rashtrawaad ke naam par apane paale main rakhaa ja rahaa he taaki aap iske naam par sawaal hi na karen
 Do not talk on the price of lentils or discuss expensive fees
 isiilie media main rashtrawaad ke kheme banaae ja rahe hai
 The anchor is asking the government to prosecute journalists for treason
 jis din patrkaar sarkaar kii taraf ho gaya, samaj lijiyegaa wo sarkaar janata ke kilaaf ho gai he
 When journalists start targeting journalists, it is a golden moment for any government
 buniyadi sawaal uthne band ho jate hai
 When the channels did not support the poor workers in the case of provident fund, they came out in thousands on the streets of Bengaluru
 kapadaa mazaduron ne sarkaar ko durust kar diya
 That's why people are watching and understanding
 je en you ke maamle main yahi log rashtrawaad kii aad lekar logon kaa dhyaan bhatka rahe the
 Have failed ab kashmir ke bahaane ise phir se launch kiya gaya he! Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has said that Burhan Wani would have been left out if the army knew it was Burhan
 bijepi kii sahyogi mahabuuba ne burhan ko aatankwaadi bhi nahin kaha or agar wo he to uske dekhte hi maar dene kii baat kyon nahin karti hai jaise rashtravaadi karte hai
 Mehbooba Mufti even took the credit of a great success from the army that she killed unknowingly
 ab to sena kii shaan main bhi gustaakhee ho gai
 Should Mehbooba Mufti be arrested and prosecuted for treason? Will anchor people also demand this? With what rights are you talking about running a case of treason against journalists? The government that they are jumping on, will that government do so that Mehbooba will be sacked? Will any of that government get this statement back from Mehbooba? isliye raajnneeti ko raajnneeti kii tarah dekhie
 If nationalism is used in this, then one day these leaders will also make the condition of nationalism like service to the country
 jab bhi ve desh seva kaa naam jubaan par laate hai, lagata he ki jhooth bol rahe hai
 We are all nationalists
 ise pataa karne ke liye rose raat ko nau baje tivi dekhne kii naubat aa jaae to aapako rashtrawaad nahin daad khaaj khujali he
 The quack whose medicine Zalim Lotion describes
 main aapako muft main ek salaah detaa hum
 For channels, you will spend three to five hundred rupees on cable every month
 jab paanch sau rupaya dekar rashtrawaad kii aad main hindu- muslim ke bich nafrat kii goli hi leni he to aap cabel katwa do
 Hate when you have decided to hate iske liye cabel ke paanch sau or raddi akhbaaron ke paanch sau kyon de rahe hai? apana ek hazaar to bachaa lijiye! So you are requested to differentiate between politics and nationalism
 yah wo rashtrawaad nahin he jo aap samaj rahe hai
 This is communalism in the name of nationalism, which you do not want to see
 sampradayikta kaa nayaa naam he rashtrawaad
 There is a need to protect nationalism from communalism and to watch less TV
 aap kabhi to sochie ki media rashtrawaad ko lekar itnaa ugr kyon ho rahaa he? kyon har baar sena or seemaa ke naam par ye rashtrawaad ubhaara jaataa he? kyon jab ye thanda padataa he to go raksha aa jaataa he? go raksha pit jaataa he to rashtrawaad aa jaataa he? is ladaai ko aap bhale hi chand ankaron ke bich kaa maamla samajhen lekin aisa he nahin

 Trying to change the image of Nanu to Janu? i am not changing images

 In Noida, in the broad day, the murderer killed the software engineer Ankit Chauhan, but in the daylight, how can anyone know that he has come to take his life after seeing a car chasing someone on a crowded road? Bhajite Naresh was told on the phone, 'bhai someone is following me
 wo mujhe maar degaa
 Save me brother '
 ab yahi aakhri line isamarderki sabase badi mistry ban gai he
 There are so many questions hidden in this line that if their answers are found, then the face of Ankit's murderer will be exposed
 haadase ke din ankit kii chuttee thi or dost ke saath apni patni ke offis lunch karne ke liye vah ghar se baahar niklaa tha
 After all, how did the murderer know at what time he would leave the house to go? There are innumerable questions which suggest that Noida software engineer Ankit Chauhan's murderer is also there
 
 He is close
 ankit ko khud kaa peechha kiye jane kaa ahsaas hote hi maar daalane kaa dar yahi sabit karata he ki kisi se pehle se uski dushmani thi yaa kisi ne use maarane kii dhamkee de rakhi thi
 After all, why did Ankit not tell about his murderer or enemies to friend Gagan in the same car? And if told, is Gagan lying? Actually the murderer was following Ankit from 15 km
 ankit phone par apane bhattije naresh ko bhi sab kuch bataa rahaa tha, to kya baraabar kii seat par baithe gagan ko usne ek baar bhi ye nahin bataaya hoga ki aakhir peechha karne vaale koun log hai? or yah bhi sochane kii baat he ki peechha karne vaale agar jaan hi lene aae the to jaan kaa khatra to gagan ko bhi hona chahie tha
 Ankit was driving the car of course
 lekin uske saath usamen uskaa dost gagan bhi baitha tha
 The question is also that if Ankit had no enemy and Ankit did not know anything about his enemies then how did he assume that the pursuers are behind his life
 aisa hona mushkil he ki kaatilon ke peechha karne ke dauraan puure raste or goli lagane se pehle tak ankit ne gagan se hamalaavaron ke bare main kuch naa bataaya ho
 After overtaking Ankit's car, one thing is certain from the manner in which the murderers drove on the middle road that the murderers were not clumsy, but they may have been given the slaughter of slaughter
 kyonki jab kaatil ne car se utar kar ankit ko goli maari to uskaa cheharaa dhakaa hua nahin tha
 But still Ankit or his friend Gagan did not recognize him
 ankit kaa ghar se nikalnaa, amisha ke paas lunch ke liye janaa is baat ko sirf ankit, amisha or gagan jaanate the
 According to the police, Ankit himself created a program to go to Amisha's office for lunch
 ankit ke pita ne aarope lagaaya he ki ankit ke mamere bhai se uske rishte thik nahin the, lekin dushmani kya thi ye philhal raaj he
 However, the police has come to know that there is a story of very old rivalry in Ankit's family
 police yah pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he ki koi aisa naakaam aashiq to is murder ke peeche nahin he, jo amisha kii shaadi se naaraaz ho
 Because the marriage took only one month
 ab sach inamen se jo bhi saamne aae par do chijen police ko sabase zyada pareshaan kar rahi he
 One is that Ankit knew that someone was going to kill him, but did all of Ankit's close friends remain unaware of his enemy? Secondly, all the evidence and witnesses so far are indicating that Ankitka's murderer was someone close to him
 is
 ankit ke pita dharmaveer chouhan ne buudhvaar kii subah meerut ke diaiji offis main yahi kaha ki yah katl unke bete ke saath kisi kii ranjish kaa hi nateeja he
 They had no idea what the rivalry was and with whom
 haalanki ankit ke pita ne ranjish kaa pataa lagane ke liye uske doston or khaas kar katl ke vakt ankit ke saath rahe gagan se poochtacha karne ko jaruri qaraar diya he
 Because he is very surprised that despite seeing the slayer closely how did he leave Gagan? padri banane ke liye uniwarsity of cambridge se bi
 How did Charles Darwin, the great scientist who reached a degree, become an atheist? In fact, just like Darwin's famous 'origin of Species by Natural Selection' theory, or the theory of gradual change of nature, Charles Darwin became progressively nostalgic during a two-year voyage of the ship Beagle
 darwin ne 22 saal kii umr main beagal naam ke samudri jahaaj main jab yatra shuru kii thi to ve ghor aastik the
 But meanwhile, while studying the origin of stones, rocks, fauna, animals, flora, many doubts arose in his mind by the end of the journey
 bible main jis tarah se sristi (isamen insaan se lekar paudhe, jaanavar or anya har tarah ke jeev jantu shaamil hai) ke bare main bataaya gaya he, darwin ko isamen andeh hone laga
 Darwin published an 1859 book titled 'origin of Species by Natural Selection'
 darwin ne bataaya jivan ke sangharsh main yogyata kii jeet hoti he
 Those who were able to adapt to nature survived and those who did not
 dianasor khatm ho gaye or jiraph apni oonchi gardan kar aaj tak jinda he
 Meaning that after circling the whole world by ship, doubts arose about Darwin's accounts of the Bible
 unhone behad krantikari theory de daali
 Which was fiercely opposed at that time
 unki theory padhaaye jane par skulon main roak laga di gai
 a biology teacher was also prosecuted for teaching Darwin's theory to children in school
 is mukademen kaa naam tha, ‘manki trial’
 a law was passed in Europe, according to which if someone preaches a new theory other than the story of the origin of creation recorded in the Bible or rejects the biblical theory, it will be punished
 khud darwin ne apane ek patr main likhte hai, ‘‘in do saalon (oktober 1836 se janvari 1839) ke dauraan mujhe dharm ke bare main dhang se sochane kaa mauka mila
 When i started my journey on Beagle, i was deeply fanatical about religion
 mujhe yaad he ki jab main naitikta se jude kai muddon par bible ko kisi akatya sandarbh kii tarah pesh karata tha to kis tarah jahaaj ke kai adhikari mujh par hansaa karte the
 But as my research progressed i became an atheist
 ’’ bete francis darwin ne 1879 main prakashit hui apni kitaab ‘da life and latters of charles darwin’ main us letters kaa zikr kiya he, jisamen unhone ek chaatr ke sawaal par jawaab likhaa he, ‘‘main ek boodha or biimaar vyakti hum
 i have a lot of work to do
 aise main aapke sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab dekar main apana samay barbaad nahin kar saktaa or na hi inkaa puraa jawaab de paanaa sambhav he
 Science has nothing to do with the existence of Christ (isa)
 main nahin maanata ki ishwar ne kisi doot ke jariye apni prakruti or manushya kii rachana main nihit apane uddeshyon ko kabhi bataaya hoga
 "in a very famous letter written on 24 November 1880, he said," i am sorry to tell you that i do not trust the Bible
 yahi kaaran he ki mujhe jisas christ ke ishwar kii santan hone par bhi vishwaas nahin he
 During the 2015 auction in New York, the bid for the letter was US $ 197,000
 darwin apni samudri yatra ke dauraan bible kii ek-ek kahani baariki se pard rahe the to duusari taraf ve prakruti ke parivartan ko mahasoos kar rahe the
 There was a rift between the scientific mind and the theistic mind
 bible par vigyaan baari padaa or vaigyanik darwin jeet gaye
 Overall, Darwin had only one purpose in detailing the story of a believer from an atheist
 
 
 ki aastik hone yaa naastik hone ke liye dhardaar tarkon kii jarurat hoti he
 At present, this journey of Darwin is a must read for those who oppose or support any particular religion without investigation

 Geneticist Spencer Wells, who traced this lineage, says that his work in the late nineties "gives a strong indication that there was a substantial migration from eastern Europe and Central Asia to India 5,000 years ago
 
 '' wales ne ise bhaaropee bhashaaen bolne vaale banjaaron ke saath joda tha or ve maanate hai ki haalia nattejey vahi baat kah rahe hai
 Clearly, this differs from the conclusions drawn on the basis of mitochondria
 aar1e1e chunki bahut vividhtapurna nahin he isliye is baat kaa bodh hona kathin he ki uski utpatti kahaan yaa kab hui rahi hogi
 Many researchers, except Wales, said that R1A1A could have been purely South Asian
 aaj ham pehle ke mukaable aar1e1e ke bare main zyada jaanate hai
 Earlier researchers looked at a few hundred markers on the y chromosome or areas where the density was high, but today almost the entire y chromosome has been sequenced
 wales ke aarambhik sanshay ko pusht karte hue aaj kai shodhakarta maan rahe hai ki aar1e1e ne ureshian stapi se dakshin asia main 4,000 se 5,000 saal pehle pravesh kiya hoga
 One of the reasons why R1A1A is not diversified is that it has recently expanded extensively; Not a lot of time has passed for the gatherings
 sampurna jinom vishleshan se ham paa sakate hai ki purvi europea aar1e1e kii vanshavali ek he jabaki iske madhya asian or dakshin asian sanskaran ek jaise hai
 "this high resolution provides us with detailed genealogical information and precise genetic dating — so we can see when and where the lineages are transformed into new branches," says BMC prescription co-author Martin Richards
 ''pracheen diene ne aar1e1e kii vibhinn shakhaon ke bich sambandhon par bhi prakaash daalane kaa kaam kiya he
 The extinct shepherds of Central Asia, the Scythians and their geographical relatives, the Srubna people who lived north of the Caspian Sea 3,750 years ago, have the same Vai lineage
 dhyaan dene vaali baat he ki skythiyanon or srubana kii aar1e1e vanshavali europiyon se nahin balki madhya asian or dakshin asian logon se milti he
 The contradiction between the findings found on the basis of mitochondria and the lineage based on the y chromosome has also been resolved
 iskaa jawaab yah he ki bharat main jo palaayan hua usamen yon santulan nahin tha
 This is an important point in BMC prescription
 richdrs kehete hai, ''tamra yug main purvi europe ke stapi kshetra se khaskar nae logon ke aagaman main bilkul spasht langik jhukaav tha'' (europe main bhi aisa hi maamla he jahaan stapi se palaayan karne vaale mukhyat: purush hi the)
 Today, our understanding is not limited to y chromosome or mitochondrial DNA studies alone
 aaj jabaki puure ke puure jinom kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he, vaigyanikon ne dakshin asia ke ateet par hamaari samajhadaari ko nai shakl di he
 In 2013, geneticist Priya Murjani and her colleagues published a research that concluded that the Indian subcontinent was mixing two vastly isolated populations 2,000 to 4,000 years ago
 moorajaani kahati hai ki ''4,000 saal pehle bhartiya upmahadweep main vishuddh or amishrit eeni or ees samooh maujuud hua karte the
 "ancestral North Indians are called ANI and Ancestral South Indians are called ASI"
 eeni kii aabaadi anuvanshik str par pashchim asiaayiyon or europiyon se milti thi
 Nick Patterson, an original researcher who developed this model of Indian origin, reduces the genetic distance between ANI and European populations so much that if you don't know the origin of someone, you would call it European population
 duusari ore, ees ke koi kareebi parijan nahin milte hai
 He was a distant family of the original inhabitants of Andaman
 moorajaani yah bhi bataati hai ki haalia ateet main bhale hi in samoohon kii numaaindgi karne vaali gaiyr-mishrit aabaadi rahi ho lekin aaj sabhi dakshin asian mul nivasee donon se hi nikle hue lagate hai
 Murjani estimated in his 2013 pamphlet that 40 per cent of the Dalits of Tamil Nadu are ANI (the rest apparently ASI)
 pathan 70 fisadi eeni hai, kashmiri pandit 65 fisadi eeni jabaki uttar pradesh ke brahman or kshatriya 55 se 60 fisadi eeni hai
 There are two rules to know when it comes to a mixture of ANI and ASI
 aap jitna zyada uttar pashchim main jaaenge, aapako utane eeni milenge
 Higher anis are found among the higher castes (bengali and Munda tribes are East Asian which is neither ANI nor ASI)
 aise hi pattern kii ukvamid vaai chromosome kii aar1e1e vanshavali se kii ja sakati he jiske bare main anuvanshik vigyaniyon kaa andaja he ki ve madhya asia se 4,000-5,000 saal pehle aae rahe honge
 Indian observers, who monitor population-related genetics, have used these findings to make sense
 sanyaal kehete hai ki ''bhartiya kai genetic dhaaraon ke mishran hai, khaskar eeni or ees jo pashaan yug se bhartiya upmahadweep main rah rahe hai
 "she has not done specific work on the direction of migration" in her studies, says Murjani, "but she believes that" the direction of migration to ANI was towards India
 ''ve aisa kyon kah rahi hai? aaie, pehle out of india vaali prasthaapana main nihit do binduon ko sambodhit karte hai
 As Sanyal states, the archaeological relationship between Southern Asia and Central Asia is subtle
 aaryon ko bharat se pehle kaa kaal yaad nahin padataa lekin pichley 10 saal ke dauraan pracheen diene main hui khojon ne dikhaaya he ki jahaan kahin puratatvavidon ko koi palaayan nahin dikhaa, vahaan bade paimaane par palaayan hua tha
 Its physical records are incomplete, so it is not easy to link it with the broader trend of history, but a fraction of it says that some populations, such as the Banjaras, do not leave archaeological traces behind
 jahaan tak bhartiya dharmik va maukhik itihaas kii daleelon kaa sawaal he, to is baat par dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki yunaan ke logon kii bhi smriti yunaan se pehle kii nahin he baavjood iske ve bhaaropee logon ke jitne hi pracheen hai
 In this case, no decision can be given on the basis of cultural memories

 Testing of samples from the Near East and Europe from five thousand to ten thousand years ago shows that the dominating genetic pattern that we see today emerged after a few chapters of the Exodus

 So can we consider India as something different from this? To establish an understanding of the South Asian genetic landscape, it is important to know that the two ancient populations of western Eurasia are very close to the people of this subcontinent

 Conversely, the southeastern heritage of Bengali, Assamese and Munda peoples is seen in their faces and jeans, and especially in the case of Munda, this similarity is evident in their language

 Many geneticists now believe that there was a large migration from Central Eurasia and Western Asia to South Asia in the Neolithic and Copper Age, and this is the most intuitive model to explain the data we have
