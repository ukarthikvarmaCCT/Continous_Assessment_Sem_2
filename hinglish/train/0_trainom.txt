 So she kept herself from the announcement
 whatsap par bina naam ke massej ghoomane lage ki gujarat main satta parivartan ho rahaa he
 Opponents never denied
 roopaani amit shah kheme ke maane jate hai to iskaa khandan na karnaa ek tarah se ise hawa dena hi he
 So on Monday, Anandiben went to meet Narendra Modi to discuss the drought
 nitin patel, gujarat ke swasthya mantri, dilli gayi neet pariksha ke mudde par charchaa ke liye
 Nitin Patel also met Amit Shah
 amit shah ke karibiyon ne ise jod diya or charchaa ched di ki nitin patel naye mukhyamantri ban sakate hai
 The comments sabhi kah rahe hai ki amit shah ab gujarat ke shah nahin bananaa chaahate hai
 It is kept that 10 Chief Ministers line up in front of National President, why would Amit Shah want to become Chief Minister
 lekin iskaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he ki aakhir amit shah kyon gujarat ke maamuli vidhayak bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 While they are not present in the assembly also
 puure saal sirf bajet seshan main ek din hi aa pate hai
 The reason is simple, Amit Shah is still keen on becoming the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 in sab charchaaon ko haalanki anandiben ne khud viraam diya he
 But before Anandiben, Narendra Modi himself has made it clear by tweeting his work that he is still trusted by Modi
 aise main bhaajapa main virodh chalata rahegaa anandiben ke khilaaf lekin unhen nuksaan kar paanaa mushkil lag rahaa he
 Yes, but Gujarat has assembly elections in 2017
 gujarat main jeetna modi ke liye bhi ahm he
 Therefore, if the controversy continues, the performance of the party can be affected
 isliye shaayad modi khud anandiben ko chunaavon se pehle ek gauravpurn vidaay den, governor banaakar
 But it still has time
 anandiben patel ke hathaaye jane kii charchaa pehali baar nahin uthi he
 When Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of the country, his favorite Amit Shah was seen in Gujarat as his natural successor
 gujarat bhaajapa main zyaadaatar log ye maanate the ki amit shah hi modi ke baad gujarat kii gaddi sanbhaalenge
 But Narendra Modi did not want this and he could not even remove Amit Shah, after all Amit Shah has always been one of the people closest to Narendra Modi
 saath hi narendra modi kii sabase bharosemand sahyogiyon main amit shah ke alaava thim anandiben patel
 But it was interesting that Amit Shah and Anandiben never existed
 donon ko hameshaa se hi ek duusare se khatra tha
 Therefore, both had to handle Narendra Modi
 lihaaza anandiben gujarat kii gaddi par baithi or amit shah ko kaha gaya rashtriya raajnneeti main sakriy rahane ko or ye bhi bharosa diya gaya ki wo party ke nae rashtriya adhyaksh honge
 Everything looked fine outside, so Anandiben's name was also proposed to Amit Shah
 ek tir se do shikaar kiye modi ne
 Amit Shah agreed despite the resentment, the signs went well and Anandiben's problems were less because of Amit Shah's stay away from Gujarat
 lekin sirf amit shah hi nahin party main zyaadaatar log anandiben se khafa the
 Anandiben is a bit impassable by nature, she gives a very bold answer to anyone else, not political
 isliye anandiben jab se mukhyamantri baniin, bhaajapa main unke khilaaf asantosh rahaa lekin narendra modi kii pasand thim isliye kisi kii khulkar virodh karne kii himmat nahin thi
 Therefore, the first campaign against her was that she had become old and had cancer
 iske bare main kisi ne khule taur par charchaa nahin kii lekin jab bhi chuphi baaten hoti thim to isaki charchaa hone lagi
 It has even increased that they can be removed due to health
 anandiben ne chunki ye khuli charchaa nahin thi, kabhi is par baat nahin kii
 But she kept working for 15-16 hours a day
 jawaab saaf tha, kya koi biimaar aadmi itnaa kaam kar saktaa he
 Dinesh Sharma was then in charge of Gujarat
 sabhi ke baavjood charchaa yahaan tak pahunchi ki dinesh sharma ko kahana padaa ki anandiben ko badalane kii baaten nirarthak hai or wo bahut acha kaam kar rahi hai
 Opponents' faces fell silent for a few days
 lekin phir pichley saal agast main patidaar andolan shuru hua
 The propaganda was done that Anandiben does not want a solution from the Patidars, so she is not letting the movement go
 patidaaron kii badi raily ke ek din pehle hi anandiben ne akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar saaf kar diya ki unhen aarakshan dena samvidhan ke mutabik sambhav nahin
 In December of the same year, in the election of local bodies, the opponents were hopeful that Anandiben could be defeated badly
 bhaajapa haari lekin sirf gramin ilaakon main, apane garh main shaharon main puri tarah haaavee raheen
 Opponents did not get a chance again
 lekin pichley kuch dinon main kuch ghatnaayen huin jisane phir is charchaa ko hawa di
 BJP President Amit Shah first came to Gujarat on 29 April
 shah, anandiben or pradesh adhyaksh vijay roopaani kii baithak hui bhaajapa mukhyalay main
 After the meeting, Rupani announced a reservation for 10 percent economic upper castes at a press conference
 anandiben patel bagal main baithi
 Although this decision should have been official, but after Rupani's announcement, the power shift was happening
 lekin baat ye thi ki anandiben patel ab bhi is faisle se sahamat nahin thim, lekin narendra modi ke green signal ke baad virodh kii gunjaaish nahin thi
 So she kept herself from the announcement
 whatsap par bina naam ke massej ghoomane lage ki gujarat main satta parivartan ho rahaa he
 Opponents never denied

 Therefore, if the controversy continues, the performance of the party can be affected
 isliye shaayad modi khud anandiben ko chunaavon se pehle ek gauravpurn vidaay den, governor banaakar
 But it still has time
 isliye sabase pehle unke khilaaf campan kiya gaya ki wo budhi ho gai hai or unhen cancer ho gaya
 Nobody discussed it openly, but whenever there were hidden things, it started being discussed
 baat yahaan tak bad gai ki swasthya kii vajah se unhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 Anandiben, since it was not an open discussion, never talked about it
 lekin wo din main 15-16 ghante kaam karti raheen
 The answer was simple, can a sick man do so much work
 tab dinesh sharma gujarat ke prabharee the
 Despite all the discussion reached here that Dinesh Sharma had to say that the talk of changing Anandiben is meaningless and she is doing a great job
 virodhiyon ke munh kuch dinon ke liye chup ho gayi
 But then in August last year, the Patidar movement started
 prachaar aisa kiya gaya ki anandiben patidaaron se samaadhaan nahin chaahatin isliye wo andolan chalane nahin de rahi hai
 a day before the big Patidar rally, Anandiben made it clear by giving advertisements in newspapers that it was not possible to give them reservation according to the constitution
 usee saal disambar main sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav main virodhiyon ko ummid thi ki anandiben buree tarah haar sakati hai
 The BJP lost but completely dominated the cities in its stronghold, only in rural areas
 virodhiyon ko phir mauka nahin mila
 But there have been some incidents in the last few days which again aired this discussion
 sabase pehle 29 april ko bhaajapa ke adhyaksh amit shah gujarat aaye
 Shah, Anandiben and state president Vijay Rupani met at BJP headquarters
 meeting ke baad roopaani ne press conference karke 10 pratishat aarthik savarna pichhadon ke liye aarakshan kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anandiben Patel sat next
 haalanki ye faisla sarkari hona chahie tha lekin roopaani kii ghoshnaa ke baad laga ki power shift ho rahaa he
 But the point was that Anandiben Patel still did not agree with this decision, but there was no scope of protest after Narendra Modi's green signal
 isliye khud ghoshnaa se bachati raheen
 On whatsapp, messages started circulating without a name that there is a change of power in Gujarat
 virodhiyon ne kabhi khandan nahin kiya
 Rupani is considered to be the Amit Shah camp, so not to deny it is to air it in a way
 isliye somvaar ko anandiben narendra modi se milane gayi sookhe par charchaa ke liye
 Nitin Patel, Health Minister of Gujarat, went to Delhi to discuss the issue of NEET exam
 nitin patel amit shah se bhi mili
 Amit Shah's close friends added this and sparked discussion that Nitin Patel could become the new chief minister
 tippaniyan Everyone is saying that Amit Shah no longer wants to become the Shah of Gujarat
 baat ye rakhi jaati he ki rashtriya adhyaksh ke aage 10 mukhyamantri line lagaate hai, aakhir amit shah mukhyamantri kyon bananaa chahenge
 But no one has the answer to why Amit Shah wants to remain a minor MLA of Gujarat
 jabaki wo vidhansabha main bhi maujuud nahin rahete
 Only one day comes in the budget session for the whole year
 vajah saaf he, amit shah ab bhi gujarat ke mukhyamantri banane ke icchhuk hai
 All these discussions have been put to rest by Anandiben himself
 lekin anandiben se pehle narendra modi ne khud unke kaam kaa bakhaan karte hue twit karke ye jaahir kar diya he ki wo ab bhi modi kii bharosemand hai
 In such a situation, the opposition in BJP will continue against Anandiben, but he is finding it difficult to do harm
 haa, lekin 2017 main gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav hai
 Winning in Gujarat is also important for Modi
 isliye vivaad chalate rahen to party ke parformens par asar pads saktaa he
 So maybe Modi himself gives Anandiben a proud speech before the elections, by making him the governor
 lekin usamen abhi vakt he
 Dinesh Sharma was then in charge of Gujarat

 Shah, Anandiben and state president Vijay Rupani met at BJP headquarters
 meeting ke baad roopaani ne press conference karke 10 pratishat aarthik savarna pichhadon ke liye aarakshan kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anandiben Patel sat next
 haalanki ye faisla sarkari hona chahie tha lekin roopaani kii ghoshnaa ke baad laga ki power shift ho rahaa he
 But the point was that Anandiben Patel still did not agree with this decision, but there was no scope of protest after Narendra Modi's green signal
 isliye khud ghoshnaa se bachati raheen
 On whatsapp, messages started circulating without a name that there is a change of power in Gujarat
 virodhiyon ne kabhi khandan nahin kiya
 Rupani is considered to be the Amit Shah camp, so not to deny it is to air it in a way
 isliye somvaar ko anandiben narendra modi se milane gayi sookhe par charchaa ke liye
 Nitin Patel, Health Minister of Gujarat, went to Delhi to discuss the issue of NEET exam
 nitin patel amit shah se bhi mili
 Amit Shah's close friends added this and sparked discussion that Nitin Patel could become the new chief minister
 tippaniyan Everyone is saying that Amit Shah no longer wants to become the Shah of Gujarat
 baat ye rakhi jaati he ki rashtriya adhyaksh ke aage 10 mukhyamantri line lagaate hai, aakhir amit shah mukhyamantri kyon bananaa chahenge
 But no one has the answer to why Amit Shah wants to remain a minor MLA of Gujarat
 jabaki wo vidhansabha main bhi maujuud nahin rahete
 Only one day comes in the budget session for the whole year
 vajah saaf he, amit shah ab bhi gujarat ke mukhyamantri banane ke icchhuk hai
 All these discussions have been put to rest by Anandiben himself
 lekin anandiben se pehle narendra modi ne khud unke kaam kaa bakhaan karte hue twit karke ye jaahir kar diya he ki wo ab bhi modi kii bharosemand hai
 In such a situation, the opposition in BJP will continue against Anandiben, but he is finding it difficult to do harm
 haa, lekin 2017 main gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav hai
 Winning in Gujarat is also important for Modi
 isliye vivaad chalate rahen to party ke parformens par asar pads saktaa he
 So maybe Modi himself gives Anandiben a proud speech before the elections, by making him the governor
 lekin usamen abhi vakt he

 So on Monday, Anandiben went to meet Narendra Modi to discuss the drought
 nitin patel, gujarat ke swasthya mantri, dilli gayi neet pariksha ke mudde par charchaa ke liye
 Nitin Patel also met Amit Shah
 amit shah ke karibiyon ne ise jod diya or charchaa ched di ki nitin patel naye mukhyamantri ban sakate hai
 The comments sabhi kah rahe hai ki amit shah ab gujarat ke shah nahin bananaa chaahate hai
 It is kept that 10 Chief Ministers line up in front of National President, why would Amit Shah want to become Chief Minister
 lekin iskaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he ki aakhir amit shah kyon gujarat ke maamuli vidhayak bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 While they are not present in the assembly also
 puure saal sirf bajet seshan main ek din hi aa pate hai
 The reason is simple, Amit Shah is still keen on becoming the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 in sab charchaaon ko haalanki anandiben ne khud viraam diya he
 But before Anandiben, Narendra Modi himself has made it clear by tweeting his work that he is still trusted by Modi
 aise main bhaajapa main virodh chalata rahegaa anandiben ke khilaaf lekin unhen nuksaan kar paanaa mushkil lag rahaa he
 Yes, but Gujarat has assembly elections in 2017
 gujarat main jeetna modi ke liye bhi ahm he
 Therefore, if the controversy continues, the performance of the party can be affected
 isliye shaayad modi khud anandiben ko chunaavon se pehle ek gauravpurn vidaay den, governor banaakar
 But it still has time

 Manoj Kumar, who reached the round of 16, will be next from Indian boxer Manoj Kumar Fazlidin Gabnazarov of Uzbekistan
 ye muqabla kisi bhi lihaaj se manoj ke liye aasaan nahin hone vaala he, kyonki uzbekistan ke mukkebaaz manoj se zyada anbhavi hai

After a few hours of the decision, no one knows the future, but some things are very clear
 jaise
 
 
 1
 chaara ghotaale main sibiai abhiyukton ko sakshya ke aadhaar par sajaa dilaane main jo unki safalataa kaa record he, us aadhaar par lalu yadav or anya abhiyukton ko raahat yaa kahiye nirdosh qaraar die jane kii sambhaavna na ke baraabar he
 In such a case, there is a strong possibility of him being convicted
 2
 If Lalu Yadav is convicted in the remaining four cases, then the chances of contesting elections are slim
 ek baar sajaa hone par 5 saal ke liye aapako ayogy qaraar diya jaataa he
 In such a case, for five years in five cases, he will have to stay away from electoral politics
 jab tak ki jharkhand hoicourt yaa supreme court unke khilaaf maamle ko nirast na kar de
 3
 har baar doshi qaraar die jane par lalu yadav ko sajaa hone par jail janaa padegaa
 And his party people also believe that he may have to go to jail four times after the shock of Monday's Supreme Court
 4
 Convicted in the fodder scam case, sentencing or going to jail will not have any adverse effect on Nitish Kumar and his relations with the Congress party, despite the fact that both the friendship and political alliance have been found guilty in one case in the fodder scam
 5
 More than Lalu Yadav's real difficult fodder scam, BJP leader Sushil Modi is about the new revelations of his property every other day
 kyonki lalu yadav bhi jaanate hai ki jis tarah sampattiyon ko arjeet kiya gaya he, use saarvajanik rup se yaa kisi jaanch agency ke saamne sahi qaraar karne main kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 6
 lalu yadav ko maaloom he ki sampatti ke khel main agar unke bete fanse tab nitish se raham kii ummid karnaa bekaar he kyonki bihar ke mukhyamantri ke paas ek maatr jamaa puunji unki apni chhavi he or wo tejpratap or tejasvi ko bachane ke chakkar main usase ganvaane kii galati nahin karenge
 7
 lalu yadav yah bhi jaanate hai ki bhale supreme court kii di gai 9 maheene ke samyavadhi main sabhi maamalon main sunwaayee puri na ho paae lekin ab ye maamle zyada din tak nahin khinchenge or vartmaan main sibiai ke aaladhikariyon kaa prayaas hoga ki jald se jald sab maamle main faisla aa jaye
 8
 filhal lalu yadav kii jamaanat bhale hi radd na ho lekin agali baar jail jane par shaayad sajaa kaa 50 fisadi samay wo jail main na gujaarey par jamaanat kii ummid karnaa bekaar he
 The comments 9
 Lalu Yadav will try to fix everything before the Center's investigation on the revelations being made by the BJP about the property
 unhen maaloom he ki adhikansh jaankariyon ko tejpratap or tejasvi yadav ne apane shapath patr main na dekar sarkaar or khaskar nitish kumaar kii mushkilen badhaai hai
 10
 chaara ghotaale kii jo jaanch lalu yadav kii raajnneeti or nijee jivan ko pichley 21 varshon se prabhavit kar rahi he or jiske kaaran unhen aadhe darjan se adhik baar jail janaa padaa filhal usase unka peechha khatm nahin hua or aane vaale kai varshon tak is chakkar main unhen court or jail ke chakkar kaatane honge

 5
 lalu yadav kii asal mushkil chaara ghotaale se zyada bijepi netaa sushil modi hai jo har duusare din unke sampatti ke nae nae khulaase ko lekar hai
 Because Lalu Yadav also knows that the way assets have been acquired, they may face a lot of difficulty in getting the agreement right in public or in front of any investigating agency
 6
 Lalu Yadav knows that if his son is caught in the property game then it is useless to expect Rahim from Nitish as the only accumulated capital of the Chief Minister of Bihar is his own image and that he can lose to Tejapratap and Tejashwi in an attempt to save him
 Will not make a mistake 7
 Lalu Yadav also knows that even if the hearing in all the cases is not completed in the given time period of 9 months of Supreme Court, now these cases will not be dragged for a long time and presently CBI officials will try to get all the cases as soon as possible
 Let me decide
 8
 At present, Lalu Yadav's bail may not be canceled but the next time he goes to jail, it is useless to expect bail if he does not spend 50 percent of his time in jail
 tippaniyan 9
 lalu yadav kaa prayaas hoga ki sampatti ki bare main bijepi dwaara ho rahe khulaase par centre kii jaanch se pehle sab kuch durust kar liya jaae
 He knows that Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav have increased the problems of the government and especially Nitish Kumar by not giving most of the information in his affidavit
 10
 The investigation into the fodder scam which has been affecting Lalu Yadav's politics and personal life for the last 21 years and which led to him being jailed for more than half a dozen times does not end his chase at all and he will be kept in this affair for many years to come
 There will be rounds of courts and jail

 For information, let us know that PIB had informed on Tuesday that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has gone on a four-day visit to Korea
 isaki vajah se yah to tay tha ki cabinet baithak main yah mudda nahin uthegaa
 The reason for this is that such an important issue related to the Ministry of Finance and Finance could not be taken up in the Cabinet meeting in the absence of the Finance Minister

 Let the central employees wait for the government's decision on the issue of HRA, among other allowances
 yah intjaar ab ek saal kaa hone ja rahaa he
 It is worth mentioning that on June 28 last year, the government decided to implement the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission
 sarkaar ne vetan ayog kii siforishein 1 janvari 2016 se lagu karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 But after several recommendations of the Pay Commission, the Central employees had raised their objection on many issues
 in muddon main alounces ko lekar vivaad bhi tha
 The government constituted a committee for this

 prithviraj ne kaha ki 2019 ke chunaav main arthvyavastha sabase bada mudda rahegaa

 This time what was in the economic report, according to the special economic survey, the number of indirect tax payers under GST is 50 percent more than the former GST regime

 Apple's much awaited smartphone iphone 6 and 6 Plus will start selling tonight
 company ne iske liye jabardast intjaam kiya he
 Although this phone is in great demand abroad including China, but the company has sent 50 to 55 thousand handsets especially to India so that customers are not disappointed
 yah khabar ek aarthik patr ne di he
 It is believed that this handset will fulfill the demand till this weekend

 iske alaava samsung ke note 4 kii bikri bhi isi hafte shuru hogi
 Although there is a huge demand for this phone in India, but it is nothing compared to China
 vahaan ab tak do karod yphone kii booking ho chuki he
 Ask yourself one question
 24 saal kii umr main bhagat singh naam kaa noujvaan faansee par chadh gaya
 Is it because in the year of 2018, there are lakhs of bankers in India and women bankers among them tell themselves that they are slaves
 ve jhooth kii buniyaad par khadey aankadon kaa sansar kab tak bachaae rakhenge, kabhi na kabhi yah aankadon kii chat unheen ke sar par girane vaali he
 Is falling 23 saal ke bhagat singh kii charchaa isliye kar rahaa hum ki tanaav or apmaan ke kaaran 23 saal kaa ek banker aspataal main bhartee ho gaya
 This is not a one-day anecdote, everyday
 bainkon kii duniya kii bhashaa kii apni shabdaawalee he
 They call the transfer as trf, the Atal Pension Yojana is called APY
 tiamati kaa matlab hua taap management taak
 The TMT of one such bank said that do not watch NDTV
 bainkon ke chairamano or riginal manageron ko kyon aisa lagata he ki ve logon kii pasand ko bhi niyantrit kar lenge
 One day, the leather chair and white towel placed on it are left
 satyanarayan baba kii katha se mukti nahin milti he, vahaan bhi baba dekhte hai ki inke peeche jhooth kaa ambara kitna bada he
 So do TMT, do top management, do not even watch NDTV, but the lie of 13 lakh people, which was living, has come out
 satya to ek din baahar aa jaataa he
 If the truth does not come, then one day the sadness of the bankers will go out, the truth will come out due to the diseases of their body
 koi zaruri nahin ki aap tathy ke sahare hi satya tak pahunchen, chehre kii jhurriyaan bhi apane aap main tathy ban jaati hai
 If there is no weight in our talks, such orders would not have been taken out
 sabhi chif manager / branch manager ko yah aadesh bheja gaya he
 In this subject, the program of NDTV India is written
 likhaa he ki conform karen mahila or purush ke liye alag-alag shauchalay kii vyavastha kar di gai he
 All this information should reach the administrative headquarters in the evening of 7 March
 iskaa matlab he mujh tak log sahi jaankaree pahunchaa rahe hai
 Syndicate Bank has also issued an order in its offices on 8 March that proper seating arrangements should be made for the customers, keeping the atmosphere clean
 saaf suthra shauchalay ho
 Many such orders were issued by banks when photographs started coming from inside the banks and see that our condition is there
 yah na samajhen ki yah sab daftaron kii aam shikaayatein hai
 After talking to hundreds of people, this pattern has come to understand how branch level managers are being treated
 kis tarah farji tarah se atal beemaa yojana karai ja rahi he taaki wo aankade main badal jaae or kamyaabi kaa daawa kar liya jaae
 The same situation is also with Mudra loan
 sirf khandan kar dene se satya nahin dhank jaataa he
 On 8 March, we wrote a fourth article on slavery in banks
 is lekh main uttar bihar gramin bank ke ek aadesh kaa zikr kiya
 You see that order
 bhashaa dekhie
 It seems that the manzors of the bank are being tied to the screws and taken to the diamond mine like a slave
 pradhan karyaalay dwaara sabhi carmikon ke liye avkaash main nahin jane dene kaa aadesh diya gaya he
 You are ordered that if any personnel are ill and depart on medical leave, they will get their treatment done at the Headquarters itself and send the relevant copy to the Regional Office
 anyathaa aapke chikitsa avkaash kii sweekruti nahin di jaaegi saath hi aapako avaitnaik kiya jayega
 Unpaid means salary was not received
 is aadesh main ye likhaa he ki aapkaa jahaan branch he us jagah se baahar nahin ja sakate
 This means that someone in the Muzaffarpur branch had a heart attack, if he had a liver problem, he could not go out of the district to Patna for treatment
 kya is tarah ke aadesh jari kiye ja sakate hai, hakeekat yah he ki is tarah ke bhayanak bhayanak aadesh jari kiye gaye hai jo maanavadhikaar kaa sidhaa sidhaa ulanghan hai
 Our right to live is a violation of the fundamental right
 samvidhan padhate to pataa chalata ki aadesh dene vaale afasar ko hi jail bhej dena chahie tha
 But when we wrote and spoke, in a few hours a new order was typed
 pehla aadesh 5 march kaa
 The new one is dated 8 March
 isamen likhaa he, 'ukt patr main aanshik sanshodhan karte hue sabhi shakhaon ko nirdesh diya jaataa he ki yadi koi adhikari yaa karmi chikitsa avkaash main mukhyalay main prasthaan karte hai to isaki soochna sakasham padaadhikari ko dekar anumati lenaa sunishchit karenge
 ' bainkon main kisi ko chuttee aasaani se nahin milti he
 North Bihar Gramin Bank also has a problem
 aam taur par ham aise bank ke bare main kam jaanate hai magar in bainkon main graahakon kii koi kami nahin rahati he
 Their role is also very important
 aam taur par gramin bank waisi jagahon par hote hai jahaan par sarkari yaa privet bank nahin pahunch pate hai
 We want to tell the condition of one of its branches today
 purvi champaran ke ek gaanv main ek bank he jahaan hazaron log sidhiyon se chadhakar rose aate hai
 This branch is running in this small room which has 12,000 account holders and only two employees
 bank ke bheetar bahut dinon se koi shauchalay nahin tha
 Now the toilet has started being built on the roof
 chaowkee par filein rakhi hui hai
 It was found here that due to rural area, the internet link here is weak
 speed kam hoti he jiske kaaran file aplod karne main inhen kaaphi dikkat aati he
 There is a whole world for spitting, but the customers of the bank take this grace on the bank wall
 yah bank kaa thook centre he
 a fire extinguisher is placed on top of it
 isi uttar bihar gramin bank kaa aadesh tha ki biimaar pad jaaenge to zile se baahar ilaaj ke liye nahin ja sakenge, ab nae aadesh main iskaa zikr nahin he
 The language of the order changed in less than 24 hours
 agar cabel waalon ne prime time ke samay awaz gaayab kar dena, kaarykram hi band kar dena, is tarah kaa kaam na kiya hota to zyaada logon tak pahunch kar bainkon ke bheetar kii zindagi par tezi se asar ho saktaa tha
 You have seen how by writing an article, raising the right question changes the language of the order
 pehle aadesh main saaf kaha gaya he ki aap mukhyalay se baahar nahin ja sakate, ab ke aadesh main yah gaayab he or kaha gaya he ki anumati lekar prasthaan kar sakate hai
 That is why i say that the way the audience has seen debates on a film for three months, if i see this series on the banks with me for two months, then the happiness of the bankers will be returned and a lot of government lies will be exposed
 mahila diwas par mahila bankeron kii daastaan par purushon ne bhi acchhee pratikriya vyakt kii he
 Many have messaged that one thing is right
 ek mahila ne apni zindagi kaa haal likhaa he, aap bhi padhie
 
 'raveesh ji, hamaari shaadi ko saat saal ho gaye, saat saal main hamaara tabadalaa saat jagahon par hua he
 That too never happened in one state
 alag-alag rajya main hua
 When i work in Chhattisgarh, my husband gets transferred to Bengal
 shaadi ke saat saal ho gaye magar ham donon saath nahin rahe
 Transfers have to shift within eight days of receiving the order
 shift hone kaa karcha bhi hamen hi uthaanaa padataa he
 Sometimes it costs up to one lakh
 bank dene main deree karata he or dete samay bhi 40-50 hazaar kaat letaa he
 Nice to have you on Women's Day
 mahilaon ke saath-saath purushon ko bhi kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 One has to stay away from home family to overcome the target
 hamaari to koi zindagi hi nahin he
 Tell you how much and what
 ' We have come to know a lot
 bank ke karmchaariyon ne kabhi ye nahin kaha ki ve bank kaa kaam nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 They are working
 aajkal sibiesai ke prashn patron kaa bhi theka inhen ke sar par he
 Come at eight in the morning and go at eight in the night
 ye routine saamaanya he or itane kaam ke baad bhi target or transfar kii dhamkee or tanaav
 Spouses have orders with or near postings, government orders, but do not apply
 mahila bankeron ko child care live aakhir kis saazish ke tahat nahin di gai
 Whereas, after becoming a mother in all departments of the central government, women get child care leave
 bank series kaa yah 11waan ank he
 By now at least the child care leave should have been announced
 kaash ki hamaare paas aankade hote to pataa chalata ki kitni mahilaon ne target or transfar kii yatnaa se bachane ke liye pramotion nahin liya he
 This is a crime committed with women bankers
 hamaari series ke baad ek mahila ne bataaya ki policy bechney ke liye unase sajane sanvarne ke liye kaha gaya
 It is not believed that all this is happening within public sector banks
 or ham tivi par dikhaa rahe hai ki ek mahila ladaaku vimaan uda rahi he
 Congratulations for that, but what about the millions of women who are leading suffocated lives within the banks
 jinke sapane udaan nahin bhar paa rahe hai
 In the 9th issue of Bank Series, we mentioned the order of United Bank of India
 usamen kaha gaya tha ki branch manager, dipti manager kii selary roak di jaaegi, asi or janarator hataa liya jayega, medical bill kaa bhugtan nahin kiya jayega
 The All India Bank Officers Association strongly condemned this
 unaidet bank of india ne apana wo aadesh waapas le liya he
 If the bank has an NPA, then the salary branch manager will be closed or the chairmen will be
 simpal sawaal he
 Can such an order be issued that salary will not be given
 kya bainkon ke bheetar jo kaam karte hai unke moulik adhikaar kuch bhi nahi hai
 Bankers' salary is not increasing
 idibiai vaale to 2012 se intazaar kar rahe hai
 The rest of the bankers say that in the salary of 20 to 24000, Delhi is becoming difficult to live even in a small city
 iske liye banker ab bolne lage hai
 a group of bankers are scheduled to gather at Jantar Mantar on 21 March
 unke postaron kii bhashaa or tevar main badlaav aane laga he
 He is receiving very little salary
 ve sirf selary kii badhottaree nahin chaahate balki kendriya karmchaariyon kii barabari chaahate hai
 There is a lot of difference between the two
 kuch bainkon main banker ne ek baij laga liya he ki main banker hum lekin meri selary kam he
 People are slowly putting their face on the poster
 jab cheharaa baahar aa jayega to ek din sach bhi aa jayega
 Governments do not let their employees speak on social media
 mantri hi bolte rahete hai
 The matter is not about discipline, every employee knows his scope, it is a matter that lies do not come out
 tippaniyan The story of the transfer is such that there is a distance of 1400 km between the husband and wife
 naukari main sirf selary hi sab kuch nahin hoti
 Work environment would also be important with him
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki saare bank main iske kaaran log pareshaan hai
 The reason for this problem is miss selling, cross selling
 dhokhe se beemaa bechnaa, bina jaankaree ke beemaa bechnaa
 Today a gentleman wrote that 500 rupees were deducted from his account and insured
 bank gaya to usee se kaha gaya ki aap aavedan dijie
 How many people must have passed through such an experience
 haalat yah ho gai he ki banker ke maa baap, or ab unke bachche bhi patr likh rahe hai yaa unase likhvaya ja rahaa he taaki kuch to asar ho
 For almost two years, i see every news published in the business newspapers once on the bank
 uskaa hindi anuwaad kar apane hindi ke pathakon ke liye apane blog yaa fasebuk pej par niyamit rup se likhata hum
 All the articles reveal big things, but the life inside the bank has become so difficult
 mumkin he chapa bhi ho or mujhase chhot gaya lekin aap bhi google kar dekhiegaa ki chapa tha yaa nahin
 Because of this series, people have given so much information that i could not achieve in a lifetime
 bainkon kii duniya kii bhashaa kii apni shabdaawalee he

 After talking to hundreds of people, this pattern has come to understand how branch level managers are being treated
 kis tarah farji tarah se atal beemaa yojana karai ja rahi he taaki wo aankade main badal jaae or kamyaabi kaa daawa kar liya jaae
 The same situation is also with Mudra loan
 sirf khandan kar dene se satya nahin dhank jaataa he
 On 8 March, we wrote a fourth article on slavery in banks
 is lekh main uttar bihar gramin bank ke ek aadesh kaa zikr kiya
 You see that order
 bhashaa dekhie
 It seems that the manzors of the bank are being tied to the screws and taken to the diamond mine like a slave
 pradhan karyaalay dwaara sabhi carmikon ke liye avkaash main nahin jane dene kaa aadesh diya gaya he
 You are ordered that if any personnel are ill and depart on medical leave, they will get their treatment done at the Headquarters itself and send the relevant copy to the Regional Office
 anyathaa aapke chikitsa avkaash kii sweekruti nahin di jaaegi saath hi aapako avaitnaik kiya jayega
 Unpaid means salary was not received
 is aadesh main ye likhaa he ki aapkaa jahaan branch he us jagah se baahar nahin ja sakate
 This means that someone in the Muzaffarpur branch had a heart attack, if he had a liver problem, he could not go out of the district to Patna for treatment
 kya is tarah ke aadesh jari kiye ja sakate hai, hakeekat yah he ki is tarah ke bhayanak bhayanak aadesh jari kiye gaye hai jo maanavadhikaar kaa sidhaa sidhaa ulanghan hai
 Our right to live is a violation of the fundamental right
 samvidhan padhate to pataa chalata ki aadesh dene vaale afasar ko hi jail bhej dena chahie tha
 But when we wrote and spoke, in a few hours a new order was typed
 pehla aadesh 5 march kaa
 The new one is dated 8 March
 isamen likhaa he, 'ukt patr main aanshik sanshodhan karte hue sabhi shakhaon ko nirdesh diya jaataa he ki yadi koi adhikari yaa karmi chikitsa avkaash main mukhyalay main prasthaan karte hai to isaki soochna sakasham padaadhikari ko dekar anumati lenaa sunishchit karenge
 ' bainkon main kisi ko chuttee aasaani se nahin milti he
 North Bihar Gramin Bank also has a problem
 aam taur par ham aise bank ke bare main kam jaanate hai magar in bainkon main graahakon kii koi kami nahin rahati he
 Their role is also very important
 aam taur par gramin bank waisi jagahon par hote hai jahaan par sarkari yaa privet bank nahin pahunch pate hai
 We want to tell the condition of one of its branches today
 purvi champaran ke ek gaanv main ek bank he jahaan hazaron log sidhiyon se chadhakar rose aate hai
 This branch is running in this small room which has 12,000 account holders and only two employees
 bank ke bheetar bahut dinon se koi shauchalay nahin tha
 Now the toilet has started being built on the roof
 chaowkee par filein rakhi hui hai
 It was found here that due to rural area, the internet link here is weak
 speed kam hoti he jiske kaaran file aplod karne main inhen kaaphi dikkat aati he
 There is a whole world for spitting, but the customers of the bank take this grace on the bank wall
 yah bank kaa thook centre he
 a fire extinguisher is placed on top of it
 isi uttar bihar gramin bank kaa aadesh tha ki biimaar pad jaaenge to zile se baahar ilaaj ke liye nahin ja sakenge, ab nae aadesh main iskaa zikr nahin he
 The language of the order changed in less than 24 hours
 agar cabel waalon ne prime time ke samay awaz gaayab kar dena, kaarykram hi band kar dena, is tarah kaa kaam na kiya hota to zyaada logon tak pahunch kar bainkon ke bheetar kii zindagi par tezi se asar ho saktaa tha
 You have seen how by writing an article, raising the right question changes the language of the order
 pehle aadesh main saaf kaha gaya he ki aap mukhyalay se baahar nahin ja sakate, ab ke aadesh main yah gaayab he or kaha gaya he ki anumati lekar prasthaan kar sakate hai
 That is why i say that the way the audience has seen debates on a film for three months, if i see this series on the banks with me for two months, then the happiness of the bankers will be returned and a lot of government lies will be exposed
 mahila diwas par mahila bankeron kii daastaan par purushon ne bhi acchhee pratikriya vyakt kii he
 Many have messaged that one thing is right
 ek mahila ne apni zindagi kaa haal likhaa he, aap bhi padhie
 
 'raveesh ji, hamaari shaadi ko saat saal ho gaye, saat saal main hamaara tabadalaa saat jagahon par hua he
 That too never happened in one state
 alag-alag rajya main hua
 When i work in Chhattisgarh, my husband gets transferred to Bengal
 shaadi ke saat saal ho gaye magar ham donon saath nahin rahe
 Transfers have to shift within eight days of receiving the order
 shift hone kaa karcha bhi hamen hi uthaanaa padataa he
 Sometimes it costs up to one lakh
 bank dene main deree karata he or dete samay bhi 40-50 hazaar kaat letaa he
 Nice to have you on Women's Day
 mahilaon ke saath-saath purushon ko bhi kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 One has to stay away from home family to overcome the target
 hamaari to koi zindagi hi nahin he
 Tell you how much and what
 ' We have come to know a lot
 bank ke karmchaariyon ne kabhi ye nahin kaha ki ve bank kaa kaam nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 They are working
 aajkal sibiesai ke prashn patron kaa bhi theka inhen ke sar par he
 Come at eight in the morning and go at eight in the night
 ye routine saamaanya he or itane kaam ke baad bhi target or transfar kii dhamkee or tanaav
 Spouses have orders with or near postings, government orders, but do not apply
 mahila bankeron ko child care live aakhir kis saazish ke tahat nahin di gai
 Whereas, after becoming a mother in all departments of the central government, women get child care leave
 bank series kaa yah 11waan ank he
 By now at least the child care leave should have been announced
 kaash ki hamaare paas aankade hote to pataa chalata ki kitni mahilaon ne target or transfar kii yatnaa se bachane ke liye pramotion nahin liya he
 This is a crime committed with women bankers
 hamaari series ke baad ek mahila ne bataaya ki policy bechney ke liye unase sajane sanvarne ke liye kaha gaya
 It is not believed that all this is happening within public sector banks
 or ham tivi par dikhaa rahe hai ki ek mahila ladaaku vimaan uda rahi he
 Congratulations for that, but what about the millions of women who are leading suffocated lives within the banks
 jinke sapane udaan nahin bhar paa rahe hai
 In the 9th issue of Bank Series, we mentioned the order of United Bank of India
 usamen kaha gaya tha ki branch manager, dipti manager kii selary roak di jaaegi, asi or janarator hataa liya jayega, medical bill kaa bhugtan nahin kiya jayega
 The All India Bank Officers Association strongly condemned this
 unaidet bank of india ne apana wo aadesh waapas le liya he
 If the bank has an NPA, then the salary branch manager will be closed or the chairmen will be
 simpal sawaal he
 Can such an order be issued that salary will not be given
 kya bainkon ke bheetar jo kaam karte hai unke moulik adhikaar kuch bhi nahi hai
 Bankers' salary is not increasing
 idibiai vaale to 2012 se intazaar kar rahe hai
 The rest of the bankers say that in the salary of 20 to 24000, Delhi is becoming difficult to live even in a small city
 iske liye banker ab bolne lage hai
 a group of bankers are scheduled to gather at Jantar Mantar on 21 March
 unke postaron kii bhashaa or tevar main badlaav aane laga he
 He is receiving very little salary
 ve sirf selary kii badhottaree nahin chaahate balki kendriya karmchaariyon kii barabari chaahate hai
 There is a lot of difference between the two
 kuch bainkon main banker ne ek baij laga liya he ki main banker hum lekin meri selary kam he
 People are slowly putting their face on the poster
 jab cheharaa baahar aa jayega to ek din sach bhi aa jayega
 Governments do not let their employees speak on social media
 mantri hi bolte rahete hai
 The matter is not about discipline, every employee knows his scope, it is a matter that lies do not come out
 tippaniyan The story of the transfer is such that there is a distance of 1400 km between the husband and wife
 naukari main sirf selary hi sab kuch nahin hoti
 Work environment would also be important with him
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki saare bank main iske kaaran log pareshaan hai
 The reason for this problem is miss selling, cross selling
 dhokhe se beemaa bechnaa, bina jaankaree ke beemaa bechnaa
 Today a gentleman wrote that 500 rupees were deducted from his account and insured
 bank gaya to usee se kaha gaya ki aap aavedan dijie
 How many people must have passed through such an experience
 haalat yah ho gai he ki banker ke maa baap, or ab unke bachche bhi patr likh rahe hai yaa unase likhvaya ja rahaa he taaki kuch to asar ho
 For almost two years, i see every news published in the business newspapers once on the bank
 uskaa hindi anuwaad kar apane hindi ke pathakon ke liye apane blog yaa fasebuk pej par niyamit rup se likhata hum
 All the articles reveal big things, but the life inside the bank has become so difficult
 mumkin he chapa bhi ho or mujhase chhot gaya lekin aap bhi google kar dekhiegaa ki chapa tha yaa nahin

 In this order, it is written that you cannot go out of the place where your branch is
 matlab ye hua ki muzaffarpur ke branch main kisi ko heart atake aayaa, liver main samasya hui to ve zile se baahar patna tak ilaaj ke liye nahin ja sakate hai
 Whether such orders can be issued, the reality is that such horrendously terrible orders have been issued which are a direct violation of human rights
 hamaare jeene ke adhikaar, moulik adhikaar kaa ulanghan he
 On reading the constitution, it would be known that only the officer who gave the order should have been sent to jail
 magar jab hamane likhaa or bolaa to chand ghante main nayaa aadesh tip ho gaya
 First order dated 5 March
 nayaa vaala aadesh 8 march kaa he
 It says, 'by making partial amendments in the said letter, all the branches are instructed that if any officer or personnel departs at the headquarters on medical leave, then the information will be given to the competent officer and the permission will be taken
 ' No one gets a holiday in banks easily
 uttar bihar gramin bank kii bhi kaaphi samasya he
 Generally we know less about such bank but there is no shortage of customers in these banks
 inaki bhoomika bhi kaaphi mahatvapurn hoti he
 Generally, rural banks are in places where government or private banks are not able to reach
 ham aaj iske ek branch kaa haal bataanaa chaahate hai
 There is a bank in a village in East Champaran where thousands of people climb the stairs daily
 is chote se kamare main yah branch chal rahi he jiske paas 12,000 khatadharak hai or karmchaaree sirf do hai
 There was no toilet within the bank for many days
 ab jaakar chat par shauchalay bananaa shuru hua he
 There are files on the outpost
 yahaan pataa chalaa ki gramin ilaake ke kaaran yahaan par internet kaa link kamazor hota he
 Speed is low due to which they face a lot of difficulty in uploading files
 thukne ke liye to sara sansar he magar bank ke graahak bank kii diwaar par hi ye krupa karte hai
 It is the spit center of the bank
 isi ke upar aag bujhane kaa yantra rakhaa he
 It was the order of North Bihar Gramin Bank that if you fall ill, you will not be able to go out of the district for treatment, now it is not mentioned in the new order
 24 ghante se kam samay main aadesh kii bhashaa badal gai
 If the cable had not done such a thing at the prime time, making the voice disappear, shutting down the program itself, reaching more people could have a faster impact on the life inside the banks
 aapane dekha ki kaise ek lekh likhane se, sahi sawaal uthaane se aadesh kii bhashaa badal jaati he
 The first order clearly states that you cannot go out of the headquarters, now in the order it is missing and it is said that you can leave with permission
 isiilie kahata hum ki jis tarah darshakon ne teen maheene tak ek film par dibet dekha he agar do maheene tak mere saath bainkon par yah series dekhe len to bankeron kii jindagi main khushiyaan laut aaengi or bahut saare sarkari jhooth kii pole khul jaaegi
 Men have also reacted well to the story of women bankers on Women's Day
 kaiyon ne messej kiya he ki ek ek baat sahi he
 a woman has written the condition of her life, you also read
 
 'ravish ji, it has been seven years since our marriage, in seven years we have been transferred to seven places
 wo bhi kabhi ek rajya main nahin hua
 Happened in a different state
 main chhattisgarh main kaam karti hum to pati kaa tabadalaa bengal main ho jaataa he
 It has been seven years of marriage, but the two of us did not live together
 transfar kaa aadesh milane ke aath din ke bheetar shift hona padataa he
 We also have to bear the cost of being shifted
 kai baar ek lakh tak kharch ho jaataa he
 The bank delays giving and also deducts 40-50 thousand while giving
 mahila diwas par aapane takalif bataai acha laga
 Along with women, men are also facing a lot of difficulties
 target dur karne ke liye ghar parivaar se dur rahanaa padataa he
 We have no life at all
 aapako kitna or kya kya bataaen
 ' ham kaaphi kuch jaan gaye hai
 The employees of the bank never said that they do not want to do the work of the bank
 ve kaam to kar hi rahe hai
 Nowadays, the contract for CBSE question papers is also on their head
 subah aath baje aate or raat ke aath baje jate hai
 This routine is normal and even after so much work the target and transfer threat and tension
 pati-patni ko saath yaa nazadik posting ke aadesh hai, sarkaar ke aadesh hai magar lagu nahin hota he
 Child care leave was not given to women bankers under what intrigue
 jabaki centre sarkaar ke sabhi vibhaagon main maa banane ke baad mahilaon ko child care live miltaa he
 This is the 11th issue of the Bank Series
 ab tak to kam se kam child care live kii ghoshnaa ho jaani chahie thi
 If we had the data, it would have been known how many women have not taken promotion to avoid the torture of target and transfer
 yah to mahila bankeron ke saath kiya jane vaala aparaadh he
 After our series, a woman told that she was asked to dress up to sell the policy
 yakeen nahin hota he ki yah sab sarkari bainkon ke bheetar ho rahaa he
 And we are showing on TV that a woman is flying a fighter plane
 uske liye badhai lekin un lakhon mahilaon kaa kya jo bainkon ke bheetar ghutan kii zindagi ji rahi hai
 Whose dreams are not able to fly
 bank series ke 9wein ank main hamane united bank of india ke aadesh kaa zikr kiya tha
 It said that the salary of branch manager, deputy manager would be withheld, AC and generator would be withdrawn, medical bills would not be paid
 ol india bank officers association ne isaki kadi ninda kii
 United Bank of India has withdrawn its order
 bank kaa enpie hoga to selary branch manager kii band hogi yaa chairamainon kii hogi
 Simple question
 kya aisa bhi aadesh jari ho saktaa he ki selary nahin di jaaegi
 Are there any fundamental rights to the work done within banks? bankeron kii selary nahin bad rahi he
 The IDBI people have been waiting since 2012
 baaki bankeron kaa kahana he ki 20 se 24000 kii selary main dilli kya chote shahar main bhi rahanaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Bankers have started speaking for this
 21 march ko jantar-mantar par bankeron kaa ek samooh jamaa hone vaala he
 The language and tone of his posters are changing
 unhen selary bahut kam mil rahi he
 They do not just want to increase the salary but also want to match the union employees
 donon main kaaphi antar he
 In some banks, the banker has put a badge that i am a banker but my salary is less
 log dhire dhire apana cheharaa poster par daalane lage hai
 When the face comes out, one day the truth will also come
 sarkarein apane karmchaariyon ko soshal media par bolne nahin detii hai
 Ministers only keep speaking
 maamla anushaasan kaa nahin he, har karmchaaree apana dayera jaanata he, maamla he ki jhooth kahin baahar na aa jaae
 The comments tabadale kii kahani to aisi he ki pati or patni ke bich 1400 kimi kaa faasla he
 Salary is not the only thing in the job
 uske saath kaam kaa maahaul bhi mahatvapurn hota
 How can it happen that people are upset due to this in the whole bank
 is pareshaani kaa kaaran he miss sailing, krans sailing
 Selling insurance by fraud, selling insurance without knowing
 aaj hi ek sajjan ne likhaa ki uske khate se 500 rupee cat gaya or beemaa ho gaya
 When he went to the bank, he was asked to apply
 is tarah ke anubhav se na jane kitne log guzare honge
 The situation has become such that the banker's parents, and now their children are also writing letters or are being written to them so that there is some effect
 main kareeb kareeb do saal se bijness akhabaaron main bank par chhapane vaali har khabar ko ek baar dekh letaa hum
 Translate it into Hindi and write regularly for my Hindi readers on my blog or Facebook page
 saare lekh se badi badi baton kaa pataa chalata he magar bank ke bheetar kii zindagi itani mushkil ho chuki he iskaa pataa nahin chalata he
 It is possible to be printed and i was missed, but you will also google and see if it was printed
 is series ke kaaran logon ne itani jaankaree di he jitani main jivan bhar main hasil nahin kar saktaa tha
 No one gets a holiday in banks easily

 vibhinn vidheyakon ke bare main bajaj ne kaha ki jiesti tathaa diwalia kanoon par aamtaur par sahmati he, lekin bhoomi vidheyak ko lekar kuch mudde hai
 Assam is one of the few states in the country where the issue of illegal migrants has become very serious
 ye avaidh pravasi aamtaur par bangladeshi hote hai
 The task of updating the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam is being done under the supervision of the Supreme Court to exclude illegal migrants from the state
 isaki duusari list bhi aa gai he, lekin is bare main gambhir andeh he ki sarkaar ko ise lagu kar paane main safalataa mil paaegi
 40,07,707 people have been found out after the nrc's second and final draft list was published
 is masale par ab jamkar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 If the Congress and the Trinamool Congress are opposing the NRC, then the BJP is completely in defense of it
 modi sarkaar ne enarasi ko taiyaar karne main puri gambhirtha dikhaai he, lekin use enarasi ko lagu kar paanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Let's know, five big reasons for this
 1
 The Bangladesh government, which does not include more than 4 million people in NRC, will hear its appeal in August and September
 antim suchi 31 disambar ko prakashit kii jaaegi
 But even if the final figure comes down to 20 lakhs, it will not be easy for the Modi government to send them to Bangladesh
 bangladesh ne saaf kar diya he ki yah assam or bharat kaa aantarik maamla he or is par vah kuch nahin kar saktaa
 According to reports, Bangladesh's Information Minister Hasanul Haque said that his country need not worry, because those 4 million people are not Bangladeshi and belong to the states around Assam
 2
 List flaws: The NRC final draft has found several flaws
 udhaaharan ke liye ek judawaan ke maamle main ek bachche kaa naam list main he, lekin duusare kaa nahin he, jabaki unki maa kaa naam he
 There have been many such cases
 sarkaar ke liye yah sambhav nahin hoga ki kisi parivaar ke ek sadsy ko parivaar se alag kar use bangladesh bhej diya jaae
 3
 grih yuddh kii ashankaenarsi ko lagu karne se kanoon-vyavastha kii gambhir samasya utpann ho sakati he, na sirf assam main balki desh ke duusare hisson main bhi
 Most Muslims living off the list are people from the community
 unke andar yah bhaavana penpegi ki centre or assam main sattarudh dakshinpanthi bijepi sarkaar unke saath atyaachaar kar rahi he
 West Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee has also alleged that BJP is doing divisive politics and Assam's NRC could lead to civil war in the country
 4
 On July 30, the day of the publication of the final draft of the election and bogus voting NRC, the Union Home Minister assured that those whose names remain excluded will be given an opportunity to appeal to the administration and submit their documents 
 iske baad antim suchi 31 disambar ko prakashit kii jaaegi
 Those who will not be named in the final NCR will be denied voting
 lekin bhrasht or shithil prashasan kii vajah se ise kadai se lagu kar paanaa sambhav nahin hoga
 Many such people have even made Aadhaar, PAN card, ration card and voter card in fake way
 yani sarkaar ke liye 'avaidh pravaasiyon' ko voting karne se rokna shaayad sambhav na ho
 5
 suchi se baahar logon kii propertisuchi se baahar ho gaye log ab desh main kahin bhi jameen,makaan yaa anya property nahin kharidpaayenge
 Not only this, the government will try to take the already registered land or house in the name of those people, whose name is not in the list
 yahaan tak ki sarkaar yah bada kaam puraa kar bhi pai to aise tamaam logon ko benami sampatti kharidne se nahin roak paaegi, jo ki desh main aam baat he
 So overall it can be said that the problems for Modi and Sonwal government have just begun
 unki asli pariksha 31 disambar ko final suchi ke prakashit hone ke baad hogi

 1 lollipop jammu-kashmir main suraksha balon kii baari tainaati ke bich pakistan ke piem imran khan (imran Khan) ne america ke raashtrapati donald trump (donald Trump) se maamle main hastkshep karne kii apil kihai
 Imran Khan tweeted that the time has come for US President Donald Trump to mediate in the Kashmir case
 pakistani pradhanmantri (imran Khan) ne likhaa, "raashtrapati trump (donald Trump) ne kashmir maamle main madhyasthata kii peshkash kii
 Now the time has come to do so as the situation there is deteriorating and the Indian Army is taking new aggressive steps along the Line of Control
 unhone kaha ki yah kshetreey sankat ko hawa dene vaale kadam hai
 The Pak PM also called an NSC meeting on Sunday to discuss national security with the country's top bureaucrats and military officials in view of the sudden escalating tensions with India
 imran khan ne rashtriya suraksha samiti (enessi) kii yah baithak sena ke un aaropon ke baad bulaai jinamein bharat dwaara ne pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir (pioke) main aam logon ko nishaanaa banaakar cluster bamon kaa istemaal karne kii baat kahi gai he
 However, the Indian Army on Saturday dismissed the allegations as "false and fabricated"
 enessi kii baithak main raksha mantri parvej khattaak, videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi, sena pramukh general qamar bajva or anya sheersh adhikari maujuud rahe
 Khan said in another tweet that as per the UN Security Council resolutions, the people of Kashmir should be allowed to exercise their right to self-determination
 unhone kaha ki dakshin asia main shanti or suraksha kaa ekmaatr rasta kashmir samasya ke shantipurna or nyaaypurna samaadhaan se hokar gujarata he
 It is worth noting that Timan Khan had also talked to Donald Trump on this issue some time back
 kashmir mudde kaa hal nikaalane ke liye america raashtrapatidonald trump (donald Trump)kii madhyasthata kii peshkash se khush pakistan ke pradhanmantriimran khan (imran Khan)ne kaha tha ki donon padosiyon ke bich ke is vivaadit mudde ko dwipaksheeya tareeke se nahin suljhaayaa ja saktaa
 Khan's statement comes just hours after India and Pakistan offered to be a mediator on the Kashmir issue by Donald Trump
 gauratlab he ki donon netaaon ne white house main mulaakaat ke dauraan afghanistan shanti prakriya sahit vibhinn muddon par charchaa kii thi
 At the same time, the Government of India rejected Trump Trump's claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi requested him to mediate on the Kashmir issue
 america kii teen din kii yatra par gaye imran khan ne trump ke is kadam kaa swaagat kiya tha
 Imran Khan from America's Fox News had said that we will never settle (kashmir dispute) in a bilateral manner
 "ovel offis main trump ke saath pehali mulaakaat ke kuch hi ghante baad pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki ek vakt tha jab general (parvej) musharraf or bharat ke pradhanmantri (atal bihari) vaajapeyi the, us vakt ham kashmir mudda sulajhane ke bahut kareeb aa gaye the
 But since then we are on two different poles and i really think India should talk
 america isamen badi bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 President Trump can play a really important role
 iske baad jab fox news ke ankar ne bharat kaa bayaan padhaa tha ki bharat kaa hameshaa se yahi rukh rahaa he ki pakistan ke saath lambit sabhi muddon ko dwipaksheeya tareeke se suljhaayaa jayega, khan ne kaha tha ki ham is dharti ke 1
 Talking about 30 billion people
 sochie agar yah mudda sulajh jaataa he to aman kaa alam kya hoga
 While denying outright that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ever spoken of American mediation on Kashmir, India had said that cross-border terrorism is mandatory for any kind of relationship with Pakistan
 shimla samjhauta or lahore udghoshnaa bharat-pakistan ke bich sabhi muddon ko dwipaksheeya tareeke se sulajhane kaa aadhaar pradaan karata he
 Imran Khan, while welcoming Trump's remarks, said that President, i can tell you that if you can resolve this issue by mediation right now, you will get the blessings of billions of people
 ek anya sawaal ke jawaab main khan ne kaha ki agar bharat apane parmaanu hathiyaar nasht kar de to pakistan bhi unhen khatm kar degaa
 He said yes, because nuclear war is not an option
 pakistan or bharat ke bich parmaanu yuddh kaa vichaar bhi khud ko barbaad karne vaala he kyonki hamaari simaaen dhaai hajaar mile tak aapas main judi hui hai
 Imran Khan said that i think there is a feeling in the subcontinent that some incidents happened in February and there was tension again on the border
 isliye logon main aisi bhaavana he or isliye maine raashtrapati trump se poocha ki kya vah is bhoomika main aana chahenge
 The US is the most powerful country in the world, the only country that can mediate between Pakistan and India to resolve the Kashmir issue
 imran khan ne kaha tha ki ham pichley 70 saal se sirf or sirf kashmir ke kaaran sabhy padosiyon kii tarah nahin rah sake hai

 police ne bataaya ki peedblyoody is fliover ke nirmaan kaa kaary dekh rahi he or fliover par na to koi bericating thi or na hi koi security guard tha
 The Jahangir police is investigating the incident with an angle of negligence on the part of the PWD
 is haadase ne sabase bada sawaal jo khadaa kiya he, vah he ki fliover ab tak shuru nahin hua he phir bike savaar is par kaise chadh gaye
 This flyover is being built in Jahangirpuri police station area on Outer Ring Road
 nirmaanadhin fliover kaaphi ooncha he, jo purv se pashchim ring road par bane fliover ko jodne kaa kaam karegaa
 But the negligence of PWD is such that no guard nor barricading has been arranged on this under-construction flyover

 "made to mark achievements on completion of two years of Narendra Modi government"
 46 minute kaa yah geet janata kii jabaan par chadhaane kii koshishen jari hai
 But see a hallmark of the Prime Minister Ujjwala scheme, where the smoke is being removed
 bihar ke navada jile kaa kalipur gaanv dhuanrahit ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he, lekin ujjwala ke tahat mili gas conection ke baavjood kalipur gaanv kii kiran devi khaanaa banane ke liye har roj upale or chuni hui lakdipoon kaa istemaal karti hai
 Husband Pramod Mistry's income could not even meet the domestic needs, so he could not get a gas connection
 ab ve kahati hai, ''conection to muft mil gaya he, lekin silendar khatm hone par ek-dde paanch-chah sau rupye lag jaaenge, isliye gas bachaakar chalate hai or koshish rahati he ki gobar yaa chuni hui lakdipoon kaa zyada istemaal karun
 Apart from the aspect of saving gas, there is also the helplessness of the poor, which has started to trap them in the clutches of the moneylenders
 uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu se 40 kimi dur kathvaara gaanv kaa maamla lijie
 The gas stove burned for the first time on July 10 in the house of 35-year-old Pushpa Gautam in a hut located on the eastern corner of this Dalit-dominated village
 pati raju ek pair se viklang hai or mazdooree kar bamushkil teen bacchon samet paanch logon kaa pet bhar pate hai
 Pushpa, who suffers from asthma due to coal smoke, was hopeful that now smoke will be overcome
 lekin jab pichley hakrate silendar khatm ho gaya to gas bharwane ke liye 530 ru
 Crisis to create a problem arose
 gomti main baadh kii vajah se raju kii mazdooree band thi, koi chaara nahin bachaa to puspa ne gaanv ke hi ek sahuukaar se mazdooree ke advance ke taur par 550 ru
 Borrowed and arranged the second cylinder
 ve bataati hai, ''ham jaise garibon ke paas doosraa silendar lene kii kuwwat nahin he
 Somehow, they are again caught in the clutches of moneylenders to make money
 '' is gaanv ke zyaadaatar garib pariwaron ke saamne riphiling karaane ke liye isi tarah kii chunauti he
 But there is also a positive aspect of the scheme which is infusing enthusiasm among poor families
 kalipur gaanv ke jitendra chandravanshi kaa parivaar ujjwala yojana ko vardaan maan rahaa he
 Says his wife Seema, "15 members of the family used to spend 25-30 rupees of wood daily to cook
" gas conection se pareshaani kam hui he
 The cylinder lasts only 25 days but upleaf and wood are also available
 '' aise main sawaal uthta he ki abhi tak ujjwala ke jo labhaarthi garib parivaar dhuen ke bich narak bhari jindagi ji rahe hai, kya unke gharon se sachmuch dhuaan chat paaegaa?chote silendar se hoga samaadhaan?darasal, ujjwala yojana main aa rahi in samasyaon kii mul vajah gaanvon main paramparaagat eendhan kii sahaj uplabdhta he
 Depending on the need, people use kerosene, coal, wood, dung, etc
, while a lump sum has to be paid for LPG
 lekin sarkaar ke ganit ke mutabik lakdi aadi kaa istemaal alpiji ke mukaable mahangaa he
 According to an official of the Ministry of Petroleum, the average consumption per year is 6 cylinders per family and when extracted its price, it sits at around 9 rupees a day
 mantralay is yojana ko paramparaagat eendhan ke mukaable behad kifayati model ke taur par pesh kar rahaa he
 Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan tells India Today, "it is true that in a month or two, Rs 450-500
 kharch karnaa garibon ke liye chunauti he
 But this is not a problem, i consider it a challenge that our oil companies are working on
 bhavishya main ho saktaa he ki logon kii jarurat or maang ke hisaab se silendar kaa aakaar chota ho jaae
 But before that we want the connection to reach 80-85 per cent of the families, then we will make a long-term strategy for the challenge of refilling
 '' unka daawa he ki ujjwala ke 60 fisadi labhaarthi riphiling karaane lage hai
 How Ujjwala's strategy started with the bjp's government transferring the subsidy directly into the account after the BJP formed the government, through which a campaign to prevent fake connections was launched and the government paid Rs 21,000 crore
 bachaae
 After this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed for 'give it up' at the Energy Sangam Program of the Petroleum Ministry on 27 March 2015
 unhone sampann logon se alpiji kii sabsidi chhodie kii apil kii, lekin pradhan ke mutabik, pradhananmantri ne us kaarykram main jo kaha ki ''give it ap se jo paisa bachegaa vah sarkaar kii tijori main nahin balki garibon ko duungaa,'' vahiin se ujjwala yojana kaa dhaancha ban gaya
 But the fact is that the UPA government had introduced the DBT scheme for transfer of subsidy, but the matter got stuck due to the decision given by the Supreme Court regarding the Aadhaar card
 us vakt petroleum padaarthon kii keemat antarrashtriya bazaar main kaaphi upar thi
 It suddenly came down drastically during the Modi government, taking advantage of which the government laid the foundation of social planning
 pehle se bache paise kaa istemaal sarkaar ne garibon ko rasoi gas conection dene ke liye kiya
 This includes Rs 1,000 crore from CSR funds of oil companies
 pool kiya gaya or kareeb 65 lakh nae conection baante gaye
 After seeing enthusiasm in the BPL families, the government made a strategy to pursue it as a concrete plan so that its political benefits can also be taken
 isi saal janvari or farvari main ghar-ghar tak conection pahunchane kii yojana tay hui
 8,000 crore for the next three years in a hurry
 kaa bajet praavdhaan hua
 Cabinet approval on 10 March, notification on 31 March and it was launched on 1 May
 lekin is yojana ko jameen par prabhavi banane ke makasad se tel companiyon ke yuva adhikariyon ko har jile main nodel officer (dieno) ke taur par tainaat kar diya gaya
 Their job is to coordinate with the distributors and distribute the connections according to the target
 kahin samasyaayein to kahin khusheeisamen andeh nahin ki yojana ko lekar garibon main utsaah he, lekin zyaadaatar kii samasya riphiling ko lekar hi he
 However, there is still resentment in many places due to lack of connection
 bihar ke navada jile ke bharosa gaanv ke indradev paswan dedh maheene se ummid lagaae agency ke chakkar kaat rahe hai to lakhanu ke paas dalit bahul shivpuri gaanv main 80 fisadi aabaadi bipiel he lekin aarthik janaganana or aadhaar card ke naamon main antar kii vajah se logon ko conection nahin mil rahe
 Not a single connection has been issued in this village yet 
 data kii gadabadi se log pareshaan hai or paatrata ke baavjood chantane kaa dar sata rahaa he
 But the Petroleum Minister argues that this figure has been prepared by the states and on the basis of this, connections are being given to the people, while in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal, people are in a tizzy
 log ise muft yojana maan rahe hai jabaki sirf conection muft he or chuulhe ke saath pehle silendar kii keemat upabhokta ko adaa kerani padati he
 Rekha Bai of Balampur near Bhopal says, "we have to wait for two weeks for the cylinder
 '' lekin bihar ke simavarti raksol prakhand ke jokiyaari gaanv kii ramavati kahati hai, ''ab upale kam banate hai, bhusa, puaal par nirbhar rahete the, lekin yah yojana vardaan ban gai he
 Kerosene consumption has also been reduced by one liter this month due to the use of cylinders
 '' isi gaanv kii mahila lachhaminiya sir par ghunghat rakhe kahati hai, ''ab jhat se khaanaa ban jaataa he
 The first guest used to face a lot of trouble
 gas ke aa jane se samay or jalaavan, donon kii bachat ho rahi he
 "kerosene quota will be cut
 With the goal of making LPG facility door-to-door, the government has stepped up a strategy to eliminate kerosene subsidy
 gaanvon main iskaa istemaal roshni or khaanaa pakaane ke liye hota he
 Pradhan says that two subsidies cannot be received simultaneously
 lekin jis ghar main eendhan or roshni kii vaikalpik vyavastha nahin he, vahaan milegi
 The government is also going to include it in the cash transfer scheme
 aktubar se jharkhand ke chah jilon main ise pehle payalat project ke taur par shuru kiya jayega
 The central government has introduced incentive scheme for states to cut kerosene quota
 isamen sabsidi se hone vaali bachat kii 75 fisadi rakam rajyon ko waapas di jaaegi
 This year the 5 per cent quota has also been reduced, while Haryana, Telangana, Karnataka have expressed willingness for voluntary cuts
 siyasat kii roti!petroleum mantri ujjwala yojana se kisi bhi rajnatik laabh se inkaar karte hai
 They believe that this plan will be a vision of socio-political change
 isse mahila shashaktikaran or paryaavaran kii suraksha ke alaava swasthya kharch main kami aegi
 Due to the time spent in cooking, it can be used for other productive activities
 modi sarkaar kii yah pehali aisi yojana he jo upie sarkaar kii manaregaa kii tarah pratyaksh rup se ghar tak pahunchane vaali he
 Therefore, the government has set a target of reaching 50 million BPL families before the 2019 general elections
 bijepi ise chunaav main prachaarit karegi ki 1955 main desh main pehali baar ai alpiji vaajapeyi sarkaar se pehle tak badi durlabh cheez hua karti thi
 But the Modi government aimed to make it reach every poor person
 is yojana ko lagu karte vakt jab sarkaar ne saamaajik aarthik janaganana ke aankade dekhe to use apana saamaajik aadhaar badhaane kaa formula bhi dikhaa
 sc-sts account for 40% of the beneficiaries of the scheme across the country, while in Uttar Pradesh alone, 45% of Dalit families will be its beneficiaries
 isliye is yojana kii shuruyaat upi ke baliya se kii gai
 In the words of Pradhan, “our ideal Pt behind this scheme
 dinadayal upaadhyaay kaa ekatm maanav darshan he kyonki centre main unki vichaardhaara kii sarkaar he
 So the government has connected elected representatives with enlightened people in the distribution of this scheme
 aazaadee ke 70 saal ke maukey par swatantraaa senaniyon ke haathon bhi ise bantwaya
 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the scheme from Ballia in UP on May 1, he said, "if a poor mother cooks on a stove with wood, a smoke equivalent of 400 cigarettes a day goes into it
" bachche usee dhuen main khaanaa khaane ko majaboor hote hai
 i have lived this life in my childhood, so decided to give LPG to 5 crore poor families
 '' lekin ek baar rasoi gas dene se ghar kya dhuaan mukt ho jayega? puspa, kiran jaisi gruhiniyan aarthik sankat se har maheene-do maheene main juujhati hai
 If the government did not make long-term complete preparations, lest the Ujjwala scheme become a one-time cycle

 ’BJP ke mantriyon par nishanashivsenaane kaha ki har roj kisi na kisi par galat kaary karne ke aarope lagate hai or fadanvis ko unka bachaav karnaa padataa he

 log in aaj release hui film 'ungali' chaar doston kii kahani he, jinka ek 'ungali gang' he, jo bhrashtachar or bhrasht system ko 'ungali' dikhaata he, or uske khilaaf apane tareeke se jang lard rahaa he
 
 
 Then a fifth friend joins these four friends, as Emraan Hashmi
 
 
 ye bhrasht karmchaariyon ko sajaa dete hai or media ko tepe bhejkar apana sandesh diya karte hai
 
 
 Police officer Kale is prepared to work on this case, played by Sanjay Dutt, but he also shows the entire police system as 'finger'
 
 
 film 'ungali' kaa vishay acha he, mudde aaj ke hai
 
 
 It has been tried to show that every human being today is troubled by corrupt systems
 
 
 bhrasht adhikariyon ko sajaa dene kaa tarika bhi kaaphi rochak he
 
 
 The film's director Rensil desilva has previously written films like 'rang De Basanti', but alas, he could not translate the good theme of 'finger' into a good story
 
 
 film kii kahani hichkole khate-khate aage badhati he
 
 
 The promo of the film features Emraan Hashmi as a hero, but the real hero is Randeep Hooda, the gang's leader
 
 
 yani imran kaa kirdaar vaisaa hi he, jitna duusare kairactor artist kaa
 
 
 Just to show one of his specialties, a scene has been kept, which you have seen in the promo itself
 
 
 kangana kii acting expressant ke bina he
 
 
 The songs are forced, which may not be remembered even after exiting the theater
 
 
 film main aapako kuch chizein acchhee bhi lagengi
 
 
 Especially the way to punish corrupt officials
 
 
 aap 'ungali' ko ek baar dekh sakate hai or mujhe yakeen he ki aap shaayad zyaada bor na hon, kyonki film kareeb do ghante kii hi he, jo jaldi paar ho jate hai
 
 
 From my point of view 'finger' is an average film made with a weak script on a good subject, which fails to touch the heart, so my rating for this film is - 2
 5 star

 pradhanmantri ne aashwaasan dilaayaa ki jab tak is ashankaon ko dur nahin kar liya jaataa ise thopa nahin jaayegaa
 Regarding GST, he said that there is a need for consensus on this and it can be implemented only with all the states
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki is saal ham is disha main pragati kar sakenge
