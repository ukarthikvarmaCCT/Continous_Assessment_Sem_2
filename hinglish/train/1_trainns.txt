 Officials said that on the occasion of the first nationwide election to be held after the withdrawal of the US Army in 2011, it was the most horrific bomb blast ever, killing 24 people
 buudhvaar ko hone vaale chunaav main iraqi matadaataaon ko hatotsahit karne ke uddeshy se ugravadiyon ne ye hamalaa kiya tha
 Nationwide elections are being held for the first time since the withdrawal of US troops in 2011
 ek police adhikari ne bataaya ki ye hamalaa sadiyah ke shahar main hua tha
 Sadiyah is located 140 kilometers northeast of Baghdad
 police adhikari ne bataaya ki chaar mahilaon or do bacchon sahit 17 logon kii maut ho gai jabaki 42 log ghayal ho gaye
 Before sunset, two policemen were killed and four others were injured in a bomb attack on a police post in the Radwaniyah suburb southwest of Baghdad
 bharat or canada ek vyapak parmaanu samjhaute ke liye baatcheet kar rahe hai jisase parmaanu urja sayantr sthapit karne kaa rasta saaf ho jayega
 Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Lisa Monette said that there was an informal conversation between the two countries in this regard last month
 iske saath hi apaucharik baatcheet ke liye jald hi kaarykram nirdhaarit hone kii ummid he
 He added that Canada supports its re-engagement with India's larger nuclear energy community
 unhone kaha ki bharat ek jimmedaar loktantric desh he jiske moulik mulyon kii swatantraaa, loktantr, maanavadhikaar tathaa kanoon kaa sammaan vaisaa hi he, jaisaa canada kaa he
 Salman Khan has once again shown that he is the Sultan of Bollywood by earning the film 'bharat Movie', this is the biggest opening of any film of Salman
 yah film apane pehle weekend main joardaar kamai karegi isaki sabhi ko ummid he
 Salman Khan has done such a charisma at the box office whenever director Ali Abbas has accompanied Zafar
 phir vah chaahe 'sultan' ho yaa phir 'tiger jinda he'
 In this way, Salman Khan has done tremendous charisma for the third time with Ali Abbas Zafar
 salmaan khan kii film 'bharat (bharat)' ko bollywood se bhi acha rispons mila he or khub tarifen mil rahi hai
 Anyway, Salman Khan is trying to do something different in his last few films, which is also visible in 'bharat'
 salmaan khan (salman Khan) kii 'bharat (bharat)' na sirf ek shaks kii kahani he balki iske jariye desh ke badalte swaroop or isaki aatma kii baat bhi kahi gai he
 But the length of the film and the inexplicably filled songs are definitely annoying
 haalanki film ko mix rivyuu mili hai
 But the coming days are going to be very important for 'india'
 salmaan khan or katrina caff (katrina Kaif) kii jodi ko log khub pasand kar rahe hai

 ) khud ko pradhanmantri pad kii daud se baahar bataate hue bhaajapa adhyaksh rajnath singh ne aaj ek prakaar se spasht sanket dete hue kaha ki yadi varsh 2014 ke aam chunaav ke baad bhaajapa satta main aati he to narendra modi sheersh pad ke ummidavaar honge
 Rajnath Singh also claimed that more allies would come to the party after the elections and even after the elections
 unhone saath hi yah bhi kaha ki bhaajapa ke chunaav prachaar abhiyaan main ram janmabhumi vivaad ke bajaay vikasaatmak mudde adhik mahatvapurn honge
 The BJP president said, "it is not necessary that the party president should also have the ability to mobilize and he should also be the prime ministerial candidate
" party kaa kaam karne ke liye mere paas jimmedaari he
 i have to work and that is work
 
 Party victory in 2014 election
 neuyork or washington kii apni paanch divasiy yatra kii shuruyaat karte hue rajnath ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, chunaav se saat maheene pehle, maine gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko party kii chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke adhyaksh ke rup main niyukt kiya
 What is unique about this? We have appointed Modi as other parties
 iske myne kyon nikaale ja rahe hai
 i have named him the head of publicity keeping in mind his image, popularity and commitment to the party
 yah puche jane par ki ye sabhi sanket kya modi ke pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar hone kaa ishaara karte hai, rajnath singh ne kaha, mukhyamantri nisandeh is samay bharat ke sarvaadhik lokapriy or kaddavar netaa hai
 Rajnath Singh said, he is popular not only among the crowd in Gujarat but also in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 uttar se lekar dakshin tak, purv se pashchim tak
 He is the only leader with national power
 unki lokapriyata chunaav main party kii madad karegi
 On the question of not presenting the party president as the prime ministerial candidate in the Lok Sabha elections, he said that is not always the case
 unhone kaha, meri ruchi khud ke party adhyaksh rahane ke dauraan bhaajapa ko centre kii satta main waapas laane or bhrashtachar main duube congress ke kushasan kaa boria bistar sametane kii he
 On the question of electoral promises, he said that BJP will increase developmental debate rather than Ram Janmabhoomi issue
 unhone saath hi kaha, ram mandir kabhi bhi bada chunavi mudda nahin rahaa
 On the whole, it is a national issue, but not an electoral issue
 rajnath party saansad anant kumaar or party netaaon vijay joli or sudhanshu trivedi ke saath america gaye hai
 Singh will deliver his important speech on India, Afghanistan and regional security at a conference in Washington on Tuesday
 unhone kaha ki kaary pradarshan vaali rajg sarkaar or bhrashtachar se peedit nikammi congress kii aguwai vaali samprag sarkaar ke kaary pradarshan main tulana karke bharat kii janata ko yah ahsaas ho chukaa he ki bhaajapa ekmaatr samaadhaan he
 Rajnath Singh said that the performance of many bjp-ruled states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh is being seen by the public that if these states compare to the poor performance of many Congress-ruled state governments and the poor condition of industries, 24-hour power and clean and effective If the administration can provide, then whom will people give preference to? log apana man bana chuke hai
 Giving details of the steps taken by the BJP to face national elections in the year 2014, he said that the party has made changes at the organizational level by forming election booth committees at each booth
 unhone kaha, bhartiya matadaataaon ko ab yah ahsaas ho gaya he ki centre paanch fisadi vikaas dar kii guarantee nahin de saktaa jabaki gujarat, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main kareeb das fisadi vikaas dar he
 No one can fool Indian voters for long now
 karnataka main party kii haalia haar tathaa kai anya rajyon main lage jatke ke bare main bhaajapa adhyaksh ne kaha ki vidhansabha chunaav or nikaay chunaav sansadeey chunaavon se alag hote hai, jahaan log sthir sarkaar ke liye matdaan karte hai
 He said that the Congress would soon be ousted from power
 rajnath singh ne kaha, hamen vishwaas he ki congress sarkaar kii vifaltaa se bhaajapa ko centre main satta main lautne main madad milegi
 Any party desirous of coming to power should give clean administration and meet the needs of the people
 yadi ve isamen vifal ho jate hai to ve satta se baahar ho jaaenge
 On the question of allies leaving the BJP, Rajnath Singh said that the BJP will try to get a clear majority in the Lok Sabha elections but will not forget its new and old allies
 unhone kaha, spasht bahumat milane kii ummid ke baavjood ham chaahate hai ki centre main sarkaar main hamaare sahyogi bhagidaari karen
 Now we have Shiv Sena and Shiromani Akali Dal and some more may come closer when the elections close
 yadi jarurat padati he to chunaav ke baad bhi samaan vichaardhaara vaale dalon ke saath gathbandhan kii sambhaavna he
 The party president said that the Congress will be eliminated in Andhra Pradesh in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections due to ambiguity on the Telangana issue
 bhaajapa ekmaatr aisi rashtriya party he, jo pruthak telugana kaa samarthan karti he or hamaari rashtriya kaaryakarini main is sambandh main ek prastaav paarit kiya gaya he

 Virender Sehwag missed out on a century but after the bowlers' disciplined performance this unbeaten batsman's unbeaten 99-run knock helped India secure a bonus point with a six-wicket royal victory over hosts Sri Lanka on Monday with around 15 overs remaining in the tri-series
 Was successful in doing
 sahvaag jab 99 ran par the tab bharat ko jeet ke liye ek ran chahie tha
 He also started celebrating the century by hitting a six off Suraj Randiv's ball but before that the umpire had given a nod to Nobel and thus Sehwag was denied a century
 isse pehle aasmaan badalon se ghira tha or aise main bhartiya tej gendbaajon visheshkar praveen kumaar ne anukool paristhitiyon kaa phayda uthaakar srilanka kaa sheersh kram jhakzor diya jisase vah aakhir tak nahin ubar paaya
 Sri Lanka team 46 despite good innings of Tillakaratne Dilshan (45) and Randiv (43)
 1 over main 170 ran par dher ho gayi
 For India, Pragyan Ojha took three for 36 while Praveen, Ishant Sharma and Ravinder Jadeja took two wickets each
 bhartiya shuruyaat bhi acchhee nahin rahi or ek samay uskaa score bhi teen wicket par 32 ran tha lekin anbhavi sahvaag ne ek chor sanbhale rakhaa 100 gend kii apni pari main 11 chauke or do chakke lagaaye jisase bharat ne 34
 Won an easy win by scoring 171 runs for four wickets in 3 overs
 trikoniya shrinkhalaa main is tarah se ab teenon tiimon ke naam par ek ek jeet darj ho gayi hai
 India lost to New Zealand by 200 runs in the first match while Sri Lanka defeated the Kiwi team by three wickets
 sahvaag kii chaturaai bhari ballebaaji kaa haalanki srilankai team ke paas koi jawaab nahin tha jinhone pehle suresh raina (21) ke saath chauthe wicket ke liye 59 ran kii saajhedaari nibhaakar bharat ko sankat se ubaara or phir captain mahendra singh dhoni (naabad 23) ke saath paanchaven wicket ke liye 80 ran jodakar team ko badi jeet dilaayi
 Sri Lankan bowlers were dominating initially and in such a situation Sehwag preferred to play well
 vah jab gendbaajon par haaavee hone kii koshish kar rahe the tab 12 gend ke andar dinesh karthik (10), viraat kohli (0) or rohit sharma (0) ke out hone se unhen khud par ankush lagaana padaa
 Raina supported Sehwag for some time but he returned to the pavilion after making an easy catch at the boundary line by pulling on the ball of Dilhara Fernando
 sahvaag ne lecith maalinga ke duusare spel ke duusare over par lagaataar do chauke jadkar apane haath khole
 He then targeted Randiv and Mathews and hit sixes in deep midwicket and square leg respectively

 Sri Lanka's troubles did not end here and Ishant, who came in as the first change, caught Tillan Samaraweera at the hands of Jadeja and put the score to 44 for four
 dilashaan ne is bich kuch achche shaat lagaaye lekin ojha kii gend par vah apana dhary kho baithe jinaki gend unke balle kaa upari kinaaraa lekar laharaati hui rohit ke paas chali gayi
 Dilshan played 62 balls and hit five fours

 At this time, Randiv and Nuwan Kulasekara (22) shared 39 runs for the eighth wicket to bring the team to some respectable scores

 Randiv picked up some useful runs before being dismissed as the last batsman
 unhone apni 61 gend kii pari main chaar chauke lagaaye

 yachika main janhit se judaa hua kuch bhi nahin he
 Not every information related to every inquiry related to people sitting in senior positions can be given in public domain

 The petition has been filed by an NGO named Energy Watchdog
 court ne yachikakarta se poocha ki wo bataaen ki jab CVC ne niyukti ke liye ijazat di hui he to shashi shankar ko kyon is pad par niyukt nahin kiya ja saktaa

 In a letter written to Sreedharan, the Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi had said that the Delhi Metro is working at only 65 per cent of its total capacity, which is extremely poor for the quality and performance of the metro
 dilli ke upmukhyamantri sisodiya ne daawa kiya tha ki dilli sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad metro main mahila yatriyon kii sankhya bad jaaegi, jisase metro kii kshamta main 90 fisadi tak kaa ijapha hoga
 He had said that even after the proposal of the Aam Aadmi Party government, the daily ridership of Delhi Metro will increase by only 3 lakh passengers per day, while the design capacity of the metro is 40 lakh passengers

 Virat said, 'I don't understand why people are just pointing fingers at him (dhoni)
 agar main teen match main ran na banaaun, to mere upar koi ungali nahin uthayega, kyonki main 35 saal kaa nahin hum, to unke saath aisa kyon? rajkot main us samay sthiti aisi thi, ki agar hardik pandya ballebaaji ke liye aate, to wo bhi ran nahin bana sakate the

 He is contributing to the team in every possible way

 aadhaar card ko inakam tex se jodne ke khilaaf daayar yachika par sunwaayee puri hone ke baad supreme court ne guuruuvaar kaa faisla surakshit rakh liya he
 The Supreme Court will now decide whether the Income Tax Act 139AA is a constitutional law to link Aadhar card to PAN card
 tippaniyan In the hearing on Thursday, the petitioner's lawyer Arvind Dattar said that the government is making step by step Aadhaar mandatory
 ye puri tarah asanvaidhanik he
 It violates the fundamental basis of the people, which gives the right to free trade in the country
 is kanoon ke tahat agar koi aadhaar card pan card ke saath nahin joda jayega to pan card avaidh ho jayega
 That is, bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards will not work, so this law should be declared unconstitutional
 pichhali sunwaayee main centre sarkaar ne supreme court main kaha tha ki aadhaar card anivaary he or jo log jaanboojhkar aadhaar nahin banavaa rahe wo ek tarah se aparaadh kar rahe hai, lekin supreme court ne centre ko tokaa tha ki aap ye nahin kah sakate ki jinhone aadhaar nahin banwaaya wo aparaadh kar rahe hai
 Actually, they are challenging the Aadhaar law and their petition is being heard in the court
 supreme court ne centre se poocha sawaal ki aadhaar data li kii khabar ai he
 On this, the Center said in the Supreme Court that this data was not leaked from UIDAI
 centre ne kaha ki ye data duusare sarkari vibhaagon se li hua he, jinhen aadhaar data ke paardarshee rakhane or surakshit rakhane main dikkat ho rahi he
 Aadhaar data is completely safe, as it has been classified by UIDAI under the IT Act as a critical infrastructure
 guuruuvaar ko hui sunwaayee main yachikakarta ke vakil arvind dattaar ne kaha ki sarkaar step bai step aadhaar ko anivaary kar rahi he
 This is completely unconstitutional
 ye logon ke moulik aadhaar kaa hanan karata he jo desh main free trade karne kaa adhikaar detaa he
 Under this law, if an Aadhaar card is not linked with a PAN card, then the PAN card will become invalid
 yani bank acount, debit card, credit card kaam nahin karenge, isliye is kanoon ko ansavaidhanik qaraar diya janaa chahie
 In the last hearing, the Central Government had said in the Supreme Court that the Aadhaar card is mandatory and those who are not deliberately making Aadhaar are committing a crime, but the Supreme Court had asked the Center that you cannot say that Aadhaar They are not committing crimes
 asaliyat main wo aadhaar kanoon ko chunauti de rahe hai or court main unki yachika par sunwaayee chal rahi he
 The Supreme Court asked the Center the question of whether the Aadhaar data leak has come
 is par centre ne supreme court main kaha ye data UIDAI se li nahin hua
 The center said that these data have been leaked from other government departments, who are having difficulty in keeping the Aadhaar data transparent and safe
 aadhaar data puri tarah surakshit he, kyonki ise UIDAI ne IT act ke tahat critical imphastracchar kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya he

 The hearing in the Bilaspur High Court on the plea and bail application against the decision of the lower court of PUCL leader Vinayak Sen has been completed and the court has reserved the verdict
 rajdroh ke maamle main aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa ke khilaaf maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta vinayak sen kii arji par hoicourt main nyaayamurti tipi sharma or nyaayamurti rel jhanvar kii khandpeeth ne sunwaayee kii
 Additional Advocate General Kishore Bhaduri favored the state government and demanded that Vinayak Sen and Piyush Guha not be granted bail
 bhadudi ne daleel di ki vinayak sen bacchon ke doctor hai, lekin unhone aaj tak rajya ke naksal prabhavit kshetron main bacchon ke swasthya se sambandhit shivi nahin lagaaya he, jabaki ve naksali gatividhiyon main jarur dilchaspee rakhte the
 When Dr
 Sen's house was searched, Naxalite literature was found from his house and not medical documents
 isse yah sabit hota he ki sen kaa kattar naksaliyon se sambandh he
 He said that Sen used to visit Narayan Sanyal in jail in connection with Naxalite activities
 ilaaj to ek bahaanaa he
 Bhaduri justified the accusation of sedition on Sen, saying that it was being said that during the conversation between Vinayak Sen and Narayan Sanyal in jail, the jailer used to be present there and all things were done in Hindi
 lekin yah baat gale nahin utar rahi he ki sen or sanyaal keval hindi main baat karte the, kyonki donon banglabhashi hai
 Bhaduri said that Gopanna, a staunch Naxalite arrested in the past, had verbally confessed to the police that he knew Vinayak Sen
 atirikt mahadhivaktaa ne piyush guha ke bare main kaha ki vah kehete hai ki vinayak sen or narayan sanyaal ko nahin jaanate hai, jo bebuniyaad he
 When the police arrested Guha, three Maoist letters were recovered from him
 yah bataaya ja rahaa he ki piyush guha tendupatta vyavsaayee he, jabaki police ne guha se tendupatta vyavsaay se sambandhit koi bhi dastavej baraamad nahin kiya
 Earlier, advocate Shailesh Ahuja of Ranjana Choubey, the wife of Superintendent of Police VK Chaubey, who filed an intervention petition against Vinayak Sen's bail application, presented additional documents in the court during the court proceedings
 ahuja ne dastavej main vinayak sen ko reeha karne ke liye nobel vijetaon dwaara apil kiye jane tathaa nelson mandela or mahatma gandhi ke saath vinayak sen kii photo par aapatti jataai or kaha ki swatantra nyaay prakriya par dabaav daalane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The court has reserved the verdict after hearing both the parties against the lower court of Sen and Guha and on the bail application
 raipur jile kii adaalat ne 24 disambar, 2010 ko sen, kolkata ke vyapaaree guha or naksali netaa sanyaal ko rajdroh ke maamle main aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa sunai thi
 Sen and Guha have filed an application for bail in the state high court against the decision of the lower court
 vinayak sen kii taraf se varisht adhivaktaa ram jethmalani ne nyaayalay main sunwaayee ke dauraan pairvi kii thi tathaa sen par lage aaropon ko raajnneeti se prerit bataaya tha
 Vinayak Sen's family, two members of the European Union and PUCL activists were present in the court during the hearing

 On the one hand, while Gauri travels in connection with work, and she is sending the older children to London for some time, on the other hand, little son Abram has gone to Goa to take vacations with his dad Shahrukh

 Lalu Prasad Yadav, synonymous with Bihar politics, was the Chief Minister who stayed in the peon's residence and ran the state government and ruled the throne of Bihar for years
 vidhayak, do baar mukhyamantri, loksabhaa saansad, rajyasabha saansad or cabinet mantri ke rup main sevaayen de chuke lalu yadav bachapan main netaa nahin doctor bananaa chaahate the
 Lalu Yadav, who spent childhood using a hand-stitched vest, used to give speeches and live among people since childhood but he never wanted to get into politics
 balki wo doctor bananaa chaahate the
 Today 11 June is Lalu Yadav's birthday, on this occasion we are telling about some interesting aspects related to him
 apni aatmakatha ‘gopalganj se raisina’ main likhte hai, ‘skool main daakhile ke baad main doctor bananaa chahta tha
 But my friend Basant told that to become a doctor one has to study biology
 iske baad mujhe pataa chalaa ki practical ke liye mujhe mendhakon kii cheerfaad kerani padegi, jisase mujhe nafrat thi
 After that i gave up my intention to become a doctor
 ’hing bechney vaale ne badal daali lalu kii kismatlalu kaa bachapan badahaali main beetaa
 Due to lack of clothes in childhood, Lalu could not take bath everyday
 vahiin, thand ke mausam main garmi paane ke liye unhen puaal ke bistar par sona padataa tha
 To eat, his mother used to boil coarse grains and mix them with milk and he used to think of him as delicious food
 in sab mushkilon ke baad bhi lalu apane bachapan ko ji rahe the
 Then an incident changed his life forever
 lalu bataate hai ki unke gaanv main ek hing bechney vaala aayaa
 Lalu threw his bag into a mischievous well
 iske baad hing bechney vaale ne puraa gaanv apane sir par uthaa liya
 During this, Lalu's mother, troubled by his mischief, asked him to go to Patna with elder brother Mukund
 lalu yadav (file photo)mukund us samay patna chaparasi awaas main rahaa karte the
 Lalu did not feel like leaving the village, yet in front of his mother's insistence he did not have one and had to go to Patna
 bataaya jaataa he ki agar hing bechney vaala nahin aayaa hota to shaayad lalu utani jaldi gaanv se baahar nahin nikalate
 It would have been possible that if he did not leave later and would have left, the story of his life would have been different
 
 
 
 When Lalu first arrived at Shoepatna, he was admitted to the upper primary school in Sheikhpura
 skool main unhone ensisi join kii or tab unhen pehali baar juuta pahanane ko mila
 He joined NCC only so that he could get full clothes
 kyonki ensisi ke bacchon ko shart, patalun or juute milte the
 Interestingly, more than half the age of Lalu, who roamed in a helicopter, used to travel 10 kilometers on foot and reach school during school time
 wo bhaashan dene or dusron kii nakal utaarne main maahir the
 With this art, he became famous in Patna, first in school and then in college
 college main wo ladakiyon ke bich kaaphi mashhoor the
 She used to call him Lalu Mahatma because his image was also like this
 wo chaatro kii khaas taur par ladakiyon kii khub madad karte the
 Lalu's love for Hindi, he has loved Hindi and Bhojpuri from the very beginning
 jab unhen elelbi kii pariksha main angreji main paper mila to unhone pariksha dene se inkaar kar diya jiske baad hindi or angreji donon bhashaaon paper muhaiyaa karaayaa gaya
 Rabri's uncle was not ready to marry Lalu In 1973, Lalu Yadav got married to Rabri Devi, a girl from a neighboring village
 us samay rabari devi kii umr 14 saal thi
 Rabri Devi's uncle was not ready for this marriage
 ek tivi kaarykram main lalu bataate hai ki rabari devi ke chachaa unase shaadi lekar gussa the
 He told his brother i
e
 Rabri's father that our girl has lived in a pucca house and the boy has a mud house
 aise main ladki kaise vahaan rahegi
 However, in the end he agreed Lalu was married to Rabri Devi
 puri-jalebi ke naam par aresas ke logon ko banaaya bevakoofcolege ke dinon main lalu jai prakaash narayan (jepi) se itane prabhavit hue ki chaatr raajnneeti main kud pade
 After this, he was like a shadow behind JP
 lalu bataate hai, ‘ek baar jepi ne jail baro abhiyaan shuru kiya or mujhase badi sankhya main chaatro ko giraftaar ke liye taiyaar karne kaa nirdesh diya
 At that time people were afraid of the name of jail
 phir bhi maine17 aise logon ko taiyaar kiya jinamein zyaadaatar abivipi-aresas se jude log the, unhen yah kahkar patna le aayaa ki mere ek dost ke ghar main puri-jalebi kaa bhoj he
 i put him in a police bus which took him to Buxar Jail
 lekin jaise hi police kii vah bas baxur jail ke paas pahunchi, sabhi 17 kaaryakarta bas se utarkar faraar ho gaye
 'lalu used to roam with Nitish near PMO to become minister, Lalu won election from Chhapra Lok Sabha of Bihar in 1989 and Nitish won election from Barh Lok Sabha
 is chunavi varsh main ve pi singh kii adhyakshata main rashtriya morcha ne aam chunaav ke baad rajeev gandhi kii aguwai vaali congress ko satta se bedakhal kar diya
 After which VP Singh became Prime Minister and Devi Lal Deputy Prime Minister
 yah aisa mauka tha jab bhartiya janata party ne vam dal ke saath milakar sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan diya tha
 The interesting thing in this whole incident was that after the victory both the mps (nitish and Lalu) reached Delhi with the dream of becoming a minister at the Center
 lalu bataate hai ki wo or nitish kumaar apni ore dhyaan khinchne kii ummid main dilli sthit pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo) ke aasapaas apana sabase acha kurta-pyjama pahanakar ghumaa karte the
 Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar (file photo)
 
 
 jab sabase bade dushman bane lalu ke dostnitish kumaar vartmaan main bihar ke mukhyamantri or lalu ke sabase bade dushman kabhi unke sabase kareebi hua karte the
 Lalu says that in 1985 when some of his party leaders were against making Lalu the leader of the opposition, it was Nitish who supported him and made other leaders ready for it
 iske baad lalu ko vipaksh kaa netaa banaaya gaya
 In 1990, Lalu became the Chief Minister of Bihar after becoming Chief Minister for the first time in 1990
 bihar kii satta par asin hote hi lalu ne teen faisle liye
 
 
 First, they removed the tax and cess on the sale of toddy

 Lalu Yadav (file Photo) Saves VP Singh's Government from Fall In 1990, it seemed that Devi Lal would withdraw support from VP Singh's government and Lalu was the leader of the Devi Lal faction
 iske vabjood wo raaton raat dilli pahunche or veepi singh ko ek aisa formula diya jiske baad devilal chaahakar bhi samarthan waapas nahin le paae
 This was the time when the Mandal Commission recommendation was implemented to save the VP Singh government of the Center and 27 percent reservation for backward people was implemented
 darasal, devilal pichhadon kaa netritv karte the, aise main veepi singh se mandal ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karwaakar lalu ne unki chhavi ek pichde netaa ke rup main sthapit kii
 Created his wife overnight
 After becoming the Chief Minister of Bihar for the first time, Lalu stayed in the peon quarters for 3 months where he lived during the school days, but after repeated persuasion by the officials, he changed his whereabouts and the Chief Minister came to the abode
 1990 se lekar 1997 tak lalu do baar bihar ke mukhyamantri rahe
 Lalu Yadav and Rabri Devi (file photo) In 1997, when he felt that he would go to jail in the fodder scam case, he made his wife Rabri Devi the chief minister overnight
 iske baad rabari devi 2005 tak bihar kii teen baar mukhyamantri baniin
 Lalu Yadav is currently serving a jail term in the fodder scam case

 11 janvari ko relies hui aditya dhar nirdeshit film uri apane 8wein hafte bhi dhuandhar kamai kar rahi he
 After Uri, many big movies have been released, like Total Dhamaal, Luka Jhuppi, Gully Boy
 lekin inamen se kisi film kaa asar uri kii kamai par padataa najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Vicky Kaushal's film is going to break the record of Simba's life time box office collection soon directed by Rohit Shetty
 uri film kii kahani 2016 main hui sargical strike kii sachhee ghatana par aadhaarit he
 It was expected from the subject of the film that it would earn well, but it was not thought that the film made on a budget of 45 crores would earn 238 crores
 sabase badi baat ye he ki uri ko kisi holiday or tyohaar ke weekend main relies nahin kiya gaya
 Yet the film's stunning earnings are shocking
 trade analist taran adarsh ne twit karte hue uri ke aankadon kii jaankaree di he
 # urithesurgicalstrikeis unshakable
 
 
 Unaffected by new films week after week
 
 
 All set to cross * lifetime biz * of # Simmba [third highest grosser of 2018]

 [week 8] Fri 38 lakhs, Sat 78 lakhs
 Total: ₹ 238
 52 cr
 India biz
 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) March 3, 2019 The film's earnings are due to the fact that Ujjwuri has a great revenue secret in February, named after the Pulwama terror attack and the subsequent Indian Air Force airstrike, such as Surgical Strike 2
 uri desh main maujuuda maahaul ke ekadam anukool he
 The figures show that after both of these incidents, Uri's clash got noticed
 14 farvari ke pulavama hamale ke baad uri ne 15 farvari ko 4
 69 crores earned
 vahiin agle din ye akda 6 karod ke aasapaas pahunch gaya
 Uri had earned Rs 75 lakh on 2 March
 3 march, ravivaar ke din film kii kamai main oochaal aane kii sambhaavna he
 It can be estimated that this collection will be around 10 million
 itane hafte baad bhi agar film kii growth behtareen he to iskaa matlab saaf he, film abhi bhi darshakon ke dil par raaj kar rahi he

 Suit up
 Let’s go for a take! 🎬A post shared byvicky Kaushal(@vickykaushal09) onfeb 1, 2019 at 6:22am pstsimba or uri kii kamai kii tulana karen to 28 disambar ko relies hui ranvir singh kii film kaa life time collection 240 karod he
 At the same time, Uri has come to 238 crore in just 8 weeks, thus the record of Simba is going to break soon
 donon ke bajet main jameen aasmaan kaa antar he
 Simba was made in the budget of 80 crores whereas Uri was in the budget of only 45 crores
 is tarah tulana kii jaae to uri har pahalu par simba par baari padati he
 Not only this, there is a lot of difference in the style of both the films
 ek film maas intertainer he to duusari film ek satya ghatana par aadhaarit he
 Priyanka Chopra plays a police officer in Prakash Jha's film Jai Ganga Jal
 is tarah kaa kirdaar nibhaate samay unke liye sakht mijaaji or kisi aam mahila jaise naram vyavhaar main santulan bithaana kaaphi chunauteepurn rahaa
 When asked about what was the biggest challenge she faced in portraying Abha Mathur's character, when Priyanka Chopra was asked, 'when you are playing a strict mood and when you get into uniform, then maintaining a common female attitude is very much It is difficult and this thing was very important for me
 prakashjior maine is bare main baat kii ki ek aurat hone ke naate meraa auraton kii tarah pesh aana kaaphi myne rakhata he lekin uske saath abha maathur ek police adhikari bhi hai
 So this character is very different

 Difficulties had arisen so much that my dear son Aditya is not happy, today is your birthday and like every birthday, even today i am sending my love to you by closing this letter
 tum mere dil kaa wo konaa ho jo maine duniya se chupa kar rakhaa he
 Every year i tell you that you were the fruit of my 6 years of waiting and prayers
 dilli ke sabase bade bade doctor (haa, 25 saal kii umr tak main dilli ke 13 bade doctors se ilaaj kara chuki thi) pandit, maulavee, pir dargah, gande tavij, vrath-puja
 
 
 i had done everything
 har doctor, har pandit ek hi baat kahata - na mere grah-nakshatron main dosha tha or na mere yaa tumhaare pita ke sharir main koi kami thi
 It was delayed, but the child happiness was written
 maine unki baat ganth baandh lee thi, or sochaa ki der se hi sahi par tum aaoge jarur
 Days passed
 ilaaj or puja-paath chalata rahaa
 i have been waiting for you very eagerly
 mujhe apane aap se, apane jivan se, apane sharir se uktaahat hone lagi thi
 He was hated himself
 aas-paas sabake bachche hote hue dekhati thi
 Inexplicably, she used to look at friends who went for abortion and then saw the loss of her life
 apni badi si car main baithkar akeli jaati to dekhati ki scooter par chaar logon kii family hansatii-khelti ja rahi he
 At the traffic signal, she would see new children begging every day and would see the numbness of her house courtyard
 uuparavaale ke nyaay, uski marji par hairaan hoti thi main
 Sometimes she used to cry
 kabhi kosti thi use
 Sometimes she would deal with him and sometimes she thought of committing suicide
 par jivan or mrityu jiske haath main he
 His will is never known
 phir ek din, 21 sitambar 1995 ko jab sara sansar ganeshji ko doodh pite hue dekhakar achambhit ho rahaa tha, us din usase bhi bada achambha mere saath hua
 Yes, the first call of your arrival was made
 kitna bada chamatkaar tha! raat ko tivi par news dekhakar soch rahi rahi thi, 'ye ganeshji ke doodh pine par itnaa hallaa-gulla kyon ho rahaa he? isse bhi bada chamatkaar hua he or duniya ko isaki khabar bhi nahin he
 'how happy we were! i knew how you would look when you arrived
 bilkul apane pita jaise- waisi hi sharaaraten, vahi chanchalta jisaki kahaniyaan sun-sun kar main thak chuki thi
 i thought that you will scold me a lot
 maatrutiv kaa aadha sukh agar krishna-lila dekhne main he to aadha sukh usee krishna ko sajaa dekar khud rone main bhi he
 My food tasted like your father too
 mirch masaale, chatpati chaat pakodee
 
 
 Nothing was eaten with me
 par aise bilkul nahin chalegaa
 i would tell you tum main ham donon kaa ansh hona jaruri tha
 You had to become a little like me and a little like your father
 kahati tumse, mere jaise padhane likhane kaa shauk le lenaa
 If i become a full-fledged father, then i will also remain with my whole life in the principal's office! When i heard your heartbeat for the first time, my heart stopped beating
 apane kaanon par vishwaas hi nahin ho rahaa tha
 When you first saw it on the ultrasound machine, i felt that the meter would go down quickly
 ye din jaldi biit jaae taaki main tumhen apni baahon main lekar tumhen dekh sakuun
 i can make love ultrasound report ko lekar ghanto chuumati rahi thi main pagal
 Started buying clothes and toys for you
 sapane bunane shuru kar die
 There was so much happiness in the house, it seemed, happiness has decided to compensate for many years! The fifth month was about to end, but i felt as if time was not running
 main doctor kii appointment kaa intjaar karti taaki tumhen phir se dekh sakuun
 i can hear kitna ajeeb hota he na maa kaa dil bhi? baccha bheetar palata rahata he to use haath se chhu paane, uski gandh mahasoos kar paane kii kisi bekaraari hoti he
 Then suddenly what happened that night
 mujhe turant pataa chal gaya ki tum takalif main ho
 My pain and yours were connected
 ham bich raat main hi hospital bhaage, doctor ne tumhaari dhadkan suni, or bas maine tumhen tab aakhri baar suna tha
 The night that followed was the longest and saddest night of our lives
 agle din kamare main tumhaari nani or daadi aapas main dhire dhire baat kar rahi thi
 Thinking that maybe i still did not feel conscious
 ki tumhen dafnaaya jaae yaa bahaya jaae
 Both were calling Panditji and asking, "pran must have died in the child, what will be the method?" Talking to each other, "show mother or not?" i thought the drama of unconsciousness was fine
 tumhen dekhne kii jarurat nahin thi mujhe, mujhe pataa tha tum kaise dikhte ho
 i did not have the courage to leave you
 aaj tak nahin he
 Because for a mother, unborn is equally real and lovely
 do saal baad tumhaari bahan ai
 But you did not come back to hear from him brother and son
 par mujh main tum jite rahe, bade hote rahe
 Today is your 18th birthday, Aditya
 Today you would have been born to me

 Your mother is writing chapters of this book
 jab meri ek behad ajij saheli ne ye khat mere i-mail main bheja tha
 Needless to say that the letter must have been a partial attempt to get hold of the pain or to express it, the pain that she had been living for the last eighteen years
 ajanme bachche ke kho jane kaa dard ankaha rah jaataa he umr bhar
 Was but was not even - it is such a relationship that even if someone tries to explain it? a woman creates a body, so a woman's mind is unable to be philosophical towards impermanence
 lekin apni twachaa ke bheetar-bheetar tikhi tis kii tarah chubte is dard se dhire-dhire samjhauta karnaa aa jaataa he
 You must have given voice while going
 jindagi se behad khubsuurati ke saath aisa hi ek samjhauta karne vaali ek maa ek thik saamne baithi thi main
 The Muslim rains of Ranchi were intent on adding a taste to the sun
 lekin jis maa ke saamne main baithi thi, unki hansi khidki ke baahar se jhaankate geele mausam ke bich kamare main rah-rahakar khili hui dhoop kii tarah pasarti jaati thi
 We were talking about his family
 main rah-rahakar nijee sawaal puch leti thi
 "why did the hostel leave the aunt to study?" "then sent the children to the hostel too?" "how were you practicing raising three children?" "hey Choti aunty, today's heroines are not heroines, item girls Just that
 “hamaari batakahi ke bich kisi baat kaa sira kahin se khulata, or kahin jaakar gum ho jaataa
 When we started talking about three very successful (and very famous) children of Aunty, we do not know from where
 
 
 “meri ek or beti thi,” antee kii awaz achaanak badal gai thi
 "older than my two daughters, and younger than my son
" ” main khamosh
 i felt that i had tried to knock at the door, which was written in big letters, "please do not disturb
" ”antee ne meri pratikriya kaa intjaar nahin kiya
 She went on speaking in a row
 “shaadi ke kai saal baad paidaa hui thi wo
 We lived in Kanpur then
 usne abhi-abhi chalanaa shuru hi kiya tha
 Son was only slightly older than him, about two years
 donon bachche chote the abhi or ghar main khel rahe the
 i put hot water in the courtyard to bathe the children
 bagal se meri padosan se aawaaj di
 
 
 i had to return some of their belongings
 bacchon ko sota dekhakar main do minute ke liye baahar darvaaze par aa gai
 
 
 We started talking
 
 
 main or pados se ain mahila
 
 
 and then
 
 
 ”lambii khamoshi or sisaki ke bich mere liye anumaan lagaana mushkil nahin tha ki is bich kya hua hoga
 That little girl must have come to the courtyard running, right where the bucket of hot water was kept
 kya hua hoga kii kalpana karte hi mujhe laga ki jaise mere gale main ataki hui rulaai ab halak se baahar pet marodate hue nikal aegi
 Such a great sense of guilt! It was such a great pain that even after almost thirty years a mother has not been able to get rid of that gum, even after two lost daughters were born after that lost child! ”we tried a lot
 sadar aspataal main thi meri bacchee
 Seventy percent was burnt
 mujhe ummid thi, lekin
 
 
 He must have suffered so much
 aaj tak lagata he ki meraa doctor hona bekaar he
 
 
 , ”that sorrow was beginning to descend again on the aunt's face
 takaleef kii ye kisi nadi hoti he ki use umr kaa dariyaa bhi kinaaraa nahin de paata? bachche ko ek kharonch lag jaae to bhi sabase zyaada ek maa hi khud ko kosti he – aise ki janane kii shakti ke saath-saath puri kaaynaat se lard-bhidakar apane bachche ko bachaakar rakhane kii zimmedaari use hi saunpi gai ho
 The first voice that comes out in pain as soon as it is hurt is the 'mother'
 sharir se baahar aane ke baad bhi maa apane bachche ke vajood ko kai saalon tak khud se juda nahin kar paati
 Then when, where would you get out of the pain of seeing your child in a lot of trouble and then losing one day? i also know a mother whose one child was brutally murdered and the other committed suicide
 main ek aisi maa ko bhi bahut kareeb se jaanati hum, jisane puri umr apane parivaar kii jimmedaariyaan nibhaai
 Then he took care of his young daughter, who is suffering from breast cancer, and is now raising her two-year-old son after the daughter passes away
 ham sab aisi maanon ko jarur jaanate honge, jisane kisi na kisi vajah se apni santan ko kho diya
 There was a girl, Tejashwi went to Gurgaon to meet another mother like me
 meri pahchaan is maa se blog ke jariye hui
 i remember well that i had written a post on the gender disclaimer from Purnia, and a blogger's comment was called Indian Homemaker
 i-mels par baat hui to maaloom padaa ki indian homemekar darasal tejasvi raav kii maan seemaa raav kaa blog tha
 In the days when the era of blogging had just started, a very lively girl named Tejashwi was not only speaking out in the virtual space with carelessness and fearlessness, but also making her own identity
 apni us beti ke liye tejasvi ne ek khat likhaa tha apane blog par
 Whom she wanted to adopt one day
 apane post ‘A letter to the future’ main usne apni bhavi beti ko likhaa:“i want you to know, that every day is a challenge, but that every time you walk out of that door, there will be someone waiting for you to get home to whom you can proudly display your battle wounds
 There will be people who'll try to change you to suit their needs, but for each of these, know that there are others who'll help you change to better yourself
 Learn to recognize the difference
 It took me ages


 you won't always find people exactly like you, but no matter who you're with, be yourself
 i want you to read To kill a mocking bird and watch Life is beautiful
 "this was a prospective mother's letter to her future daughter
 ye ek peedi kii aurat kaa duusari peedi kii aurat ko khat tha
 It is amazing that Tejashwi, who was asking his unborn daughter to watch the book and the film, has a father who teaches his children to be a good parent
 tejasvi main bhavi maa bhi thi or ek bhavi pita bhi
 Stunning would have been priceless for society, for family
 ek acchhee maa hoti, ek acchhee parent hoti
 On 11 August 2010, Tejashwi breathed his last while battling dengue in a Delhi hospital
 uski maut neshnal hedlains sirf isliye nahin baniin kyonki dengue tab khabaron main tha, balki isliye bani kyonki ek jindadil ladki achaanak chali gai thi
 Those who wrote about Tejashwi remembered Tejashwi many times, and very strongly
 apni maut ke kul bees din pehle tejasvi ne apane blog par likhaa tha:“when I’m old (one day) and lying in bed, knowing (“somehow”) that my time has come, I’ll see my life flashing before my eyes
 The post was accompanied by a video, and the excitement of the college opening after the holidays
 or phir ek din achaanak tejasvi ne likhnaa band kar diya, saansen lenaa band kar diya
 Do you know if he may have seen a little bit of his life in front of his eyes while lying on the ventilator in ICU or not
 aakhir is dard kii dawa kya he dukh ke kai rang hote hai
 And in order to bear the sorrows, we also invent our own way
 jinamein jijeevishaa hoti he, or jo har haal main jeena chaahate hai unke liye ‘grief’, ‘shok’ yaa ‘santaap’ bhi jeene kaa sabab hota he
 In moments of sorrow, we are closest to us, in our purest, honest form
 valnarebiliti (vulnerability) kaa apana sukh he
 Not everyone knows how to disintegrate
 jise aata he, wo waapas utani hi teji se khud ko jod letaa he
 Breaking and then crushing yourself is another name for living
 tejasvi kii maa seemaa ne thik yahi kar dikhaaya
 The grief of her daughter's departure became the reason for Seema to join many other mothers
 seemaa apane blog par likhti hai, tejasvi kii har us khwaahish ko jiti hai jo atharah saal kii itti-si jindagi main usne sanjoe the
 When i went to meet the border, Tejashwi had passed for three years
 seemaa apane parivaar ke saath nae ghar main shift kar chuki thim
 The boundaries between new curtains, new carpets and new ways of living were engaged in saving their old memories and old beliefs
 tejasvi ne jis bhavi beti ke liye khat likhaa tha, seemaa us bhavi beti ko god lekar ghar le ai thi
 When we were talking about Tejashwi, Seema's eight-year-old adopted daughter went to school
 lekin tejasvi kii yaadon ke bich maa ke taur par apana lee gai nai jimmedaari seemaa ke chehre par aksar subah kii os se chamak uthati thi
 The mention of Tejaswi still comes alive
 seemaa ke blog par tejasvi abhi bhi vaise hi maujuud he jaise chaar saal pehle thi
 But for Seema, stunning and protecting her faith has become the purpose of living, and the way to recover from the sorrow
 main seemaa ke bare main aksar sochati hum
 About the stunning too
 jindagi kabhi ekares nahin hoti to phir parivaar main sabakuch khushhaal kaise rahegaa? agar ek parivaar alag-alag rishton or vajoodon kaa yogafal he to har rishte main aanevaali ek choti-si halchal bhi parivaar ke sameekaran bigaadegi
 One incident, one incident affects all the members of the family
 jaahir he, ek maa par kahin zyada
 Therefore, if it is the responsibility of the mother to keep herself from disintegrating the family, then it is also the duty of a family to give a bereaved mother a chance to get rid of her sorrow, give her the freedom so that the mother is within herself Trouble was able to get creative in some way or the other
 “marijon ko dekhnaa mere liye maraham tha
 When i was doing my work, i would not think about the incident that happened to me
 meraa kaam mujhe masaroof rakhata tha, isliye main paaglon kii tarah kaam karti thi
 Sometimes i think that if i did not have the slightest satisfaction of being saved, i would have never forgiven myself and gone mad, ”doctor Aunty told me with a long deep breath
 apane ghar kii ek diwaar par lagi kai blike and white or rangeen tasviren ek bachche kii tarah chahak-chahak kar dikhaa rahi thim doctor antee
 Pictures of children's wedding, pictures of award ceremonies they receive, pictures of their children's childhood, pictures of holidays, pictures of laughter, pictures of happiness
 
 
 un lamhon kii tasveeron jinamein zindagi kii umang thi
 His laughter had returned while talking about his children
 ve apni jindagi par ek kitaab likhnaa chaahati hai ab, jinhen unke naati-pote pard sake
 "I think about my sorrow and look around that people are more unfortunate than me
 kitni to takaliphen hai is duniya main
 It is also strange to be a mother
 aap un sari takalifon ke prati sensitive ho jate hai jinke bare main shaayad aapane pehle nahin sochaa tha,“ apane ajanme bete ko uski har saalagirah par khat likhane vaali maa ne kaha tha mujhase
 This is what happens
 
 
 maa ho janaa

 The case is of Laxmi Nagar police station in the capital Delhi
 purvi dilli ke laksminagar ilaake main ke nivasee akaash kii bike 18 agast ko chori ho gai thi, jisaki taharir akaash darj karvaa chukaa tha
 a few days later, Akash got a call from the police station that he had got his bike, after which he was no longer happy

 shahanvaj hossain ne kaha ki doctor shyama prasad mukherjee ko ham chunavi drushti se yaad nahin karte, ham rashtriya drushti se yaad karte hai, kyonki doctor mukherjee na hote to bengal kaa ek hissaa pakistan ko chalaa jaataa
 Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said that he should put any documents in front of what the Prime Minister is saying
 tiwari ne kaha ki shyama prasad mukherjee ke liye mere man main aadar he or usee aadar ke saath kahana chahta hum ki mujhe vah itihaas kii kitaab dikhaa do jahaan iskaa zikr ho yaa mujhe vah dastavej dikhaa do jahaan shyama prasad mukherjee ne koi aisa patr likhaa ho yaa aisi koi baat kahi ho
 Tiwari said, "show or tell me the part which left Bengal because of what he said
" bantwaaraa dukhad tha
 The Prime Minister speaks many things, but it is unfortunate to say such a historical fact which is completely false
 mana ki pradhanmantri 2019 kii taiyaari kar rahe hai lekin unke pad ko shobhaa nahin detaa he
 Responding to Pramod Tiwari's attack, BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain said in a conversation with 'aaj Tak' that the Congress finds everything false by wearing glasses of lies in everything
 unako netaji subhash chandra bose kaa yogadan desh ke andar jhooth lagata he, unako shyama prasad mukherjee kaa yogadan desh ke andar jhooth lagata he, unako baba sahab ambedkar kaa yogadan jhooth lagata he kyonki congress ke najar main nehru ji ke alaava vah kisi bhi naam par koi charchaa karnaa nahin chaahate
 What Prime Minister Modi said in 'man Ki Baat', Prime Minister Modi recalled Jana Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, saying that on 23 June was the death anniversary of Dr
 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the son of the nation
 unka jivan kai kshetron se judaa rahaa, lekin khaas taur par shiksha ke kshetra main unhone kaaphi kaam kiya
 He became the Vice Chancellor of the University at the age of just 33 years
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki bharat kii audyogic tarakkee kii neenv rakhane ke liye bhi doctor mukherjee ko hameshaa yaad rakhaa jayega
 Prime Minister Modi said that Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was a strong supporter of India's integrity
 unhone desh kii akhandta ke liye mukhar tareeke se aawaaj uthaai
 Due to his efforts, a part of Bengal has become an integral part of India today
 52 saal kii umr main unhone desh kii ekta or akhandta ke liye apni jaan ganvaa di
 We all should remember this great man of the country

 It is clear that Washington has played an important role in reducing tensions between India and Pakistan and in the release of the pilot
 kyonki imran khan ke elaan se thik pehle america raashtrapati donald trump ne guuruuvaar ko hanoi main world media se kaha ki unke paas bharat or pakistan se bahut acchhee khabar he
 In response to the question of journalists, he said that we have been involved in efforts to reduce the tension between India and Pakistan and we have very good news from India and Pakistan and hope that the tensions between the two countries will end soon
 unhone kaha tha ki mujhe ummid he ki bharat-paak ke bich ab tanaav kii sthiti samaapt hone ja rahaa he
 Also, the role of the US can be understood in such a way that there were reports that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held talks with Indian security adviser Ajit Doval for about 25 minutes on Thursday morning
 bharat-paak maamle main ek or ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaala desh tha sanyukt arab emirate, jo bharat kaa ab ahm sahyogi ban chukaa he
 Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates made a tweet on Thursday evening, according to which he called the Indian Prime Minister and the Pakistani Prime Minister and on the importance of prioritizing dialogue and communication to deal with the recent developments wisely Was stressed

 itnaa hi nahin, in deshon ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main jaish ke sargana masood ajahar ko blaclist karne ke liye ek prastaav bhi laayaa
 Let us tell you that India was asked to release the pilot greetings unconditionally, after which Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced the release of the Indian pilot greetings under the spirit of peace
 wing commander abhinandan ko aaj pakistan wagha border ke jariye bharat ko saupegaa, jise lene ke liye bharat sarkaar kaa ek pratinidhi mandal jayega
 However, it is not yet clear whether Pakistan will hand over the reception to the International Red Cross or to Indian authorities

 The Congress leader said that Hazare's movement is sponsored by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 unhone kaha, ‘main pehle hi kah chukaa hum ki jab sangh aatankwaadi gatividhiyon main pakadaa gaya to usne dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye suniyojit dhang se bhrashtachar ko mudda banaaya

 yahaan tak ki un varshon main bhi jab fortis healthcare ko chalaane kaa jimmaa shivinder mohan singh par tha, board kii baithken unke bade bhai or company ke chairman malvinder mohan singh lete the
 Shivainder, the vice chairman, never disagreed with Malvinder in board meetings or in public
 isliye jab shivinder ne 4 sitambar ko neshnal company lau tribunel main malvinder par kathith 'utpeeda or kuprabandhan' ke liye mukadmaa chalaane kii arji lagaai to bahut se logon bhauchak rah gaye
 But to put it clearly, the seeds of this tension had already been formed long back
 donon bhaaiyon ne takreeban 22,500 karod ru
 They lost and owned India's largest hospital chain Fortis Healthcare and India's largest non-banking finance company Religare Enterprises
 june 2008 main donon bhaaiyon malvinder or shivinder singh ke paas 9,500 karod ru
 Cash was what he got from the sale of Ranbaxy Laboratories, India's largest pharmaceutical company
 lekin aath saal baad, ek roj aisa aa gaya jab donon 13,000 karod ru
 More than were in debt
 kabhi donon bhai sanyukt vaktavy jari karke is karj ke boj ke liye railigare ke siio sunil godhwani ko doshi tehraate hue ek-duusare ke prati bharosa or ekajutata jataa rahe the; phir ek din aisa aayaa jab shivinder yah elaan kar rahe the ki unhone malvinder ke saath apane sabhi vyapaarik sambandhon ko puri tarah khatm kar liya he
 One day, Shivinder went to the National Company Law Tribunal against Malvinder and Godhwani for alleged harassment, mismanagement and forgery
 phir ek roj, maa nimmi singh dwaara is maamle kaa hal parivaar ke bujurgon ke saath mil-baithkar nikaalane kii apil ke baad, shivinder tribunal se cese waapas le lete hai
 Malvinder and Shivinder Singh said in a shared statement sent by email, "despite all possible efforts to repay the debt, today, we have lost ownership of all our major businesses such as Fortis, SRL and Religare as banks
 Our shares which were pledged have been forfeited
 ab hamaare paas in vyavsaayon ke nammaatr ke share hi bache hai
 '' Both the brothers had Rs 22,500 crore
 or itnaa bada kaarobaari samrajya kaise matiamet kar diya! yah paise kii bekadri, bevakoofi, pehle aankh moond kar bharosa or ab aapasi bharose ke ant kii ek dilachasp kahani he
 The main characters of this triangular story include the two Singh brothers, their maternal uncle Gurinder Singh Dhillon and his family, and former CEO of Religare Sunil Narayandas Godhwani
 dhillon—jinhen 'babaaji' yaa 'sant of beas' ke naam se janaa jaataa he—us prabhaavshaalee radhaswami satsang beas (aresasbi) ke aadhyatmik guru hai jiske deshbhar main bees lakh se adhik anuyaayi hai or jiske paas bepanaah jameen hai
 The strength of the RSSB can be gauged from the fact that there are arrangements to accommodate 50 to 5,00,000 people during its Sant Samagam at its 5,000 centers
 singh bandhuon ko 2008 main ranbaxy ko japan ke daichi-sankyo ke haathon bechney ke baad 9,576 karod ru
 2,000 crores, out of which Rs
 kaa istemaal donon ne tex or karj chukaane main kiya tha
 The remaining Rs 7,500 crore
 main se 1,750 karod ru
 Was invested to propel Religare and Rs 2,230 crore
 kaa nivesh fortis main kiya gaya tha
 But the most important is that Rs 2,700 crore
 dhillon parivaar, gurinder dhillon kii patni shabnam dhillon ke swaamitv vaali companiyon or aresasbi ke varisht kaaryakartaaon kii companiyon ko sthanantarit kar die gaye the
 The money has not yet been returned to the Singh brothers
 railigare or fortis ke paas kaaphi nakadi padi thi
 Obviously, his balance sheet was very good
 iskaa phayda uthaate unhone bharpoor karj liya or betahasha kharch karte chale gaye
 Meanwhile, Dhillon and RSSB associates ventured into the real estate sector
 2000 ke uttarardh main yah kshetra asaadhaaran ritern de rahaa tha
 For more and more purchases in real estate, he went on borrowing money at a high interest of 12-14 per cent
 yah sab antat unke liye bada ghaatak siddh hua
 When the recession hit, Religare and Fortis began to sweat to repay the huge debt they had taken during their expansion
 apane donon flagship ko bachaane ke liye singh bandhuon ko apane rigerv main se paise nikaalane kii naubat aa gai
 But that could not happen
 desh kii arthvyavastha mandi kii vajah se charmara gai thi
 The real estate sector collapsed due to a steep fall in prices
 is maar se na to dhillon ubar paae or na hi singh bandhu
 To know about this, mails were sent to both Dhillon and Singh brothers but no one responded
 singh bandhu tab pichhali dendariyon ke bhugtan kii khatir karj ke liye samooh kii companiyon kii sampattiyon or equity ko bandhak rakhane ke ek dushchakr main fanse hue the
 At times, he also used the money of the group companies to pay the obligations of private holding companies
 philhal, niamak adhikari un maamalon kii jaanch main jute hai
 Both the Serious Fraud Investigation Office and SEBI are investigating alleged financial irregularities led by the Singh brothers
 iske alaava un par bina kisi manjuuri ke company se 473 karod ru
 The transfer of charges is also under investigation
 singh bandhuon ne kaha he ki paisa us company ko diya gaya tha jo paise ke hastantaran ke samay bhale hi sambandhit party nahin thi, lekin pramotaron dwaara baad main unka adhigrahan kar liya gaya tha
 Therefore, it has become a case of a related party transaction

 jab unhone group kii companiyon main se apana hissaa bechakar rin ke bhugtan kii koshish kii to singh bandhuon ke prayaason kii raah main daichi sankyo dwaara adaalat ke adeshon ke madhyam se kai baar adanghe lagaae gaye
 Daiichi went to court and proved there that the two brothers had enough assets to pay $ 500 million in lieu of the arbitration order they had filed during the sale of Ranbaxy to hide important information by the Singh brothers
 i had won vah aadesh philhal singapore kii ek apiliy adaalat ke paas surakshit he
 The lenders confiscated the equity holding of the Singh brothers in the group companies with the banks after they were unable to arrange sufficient funds to repay the loan
 fortis or railigare main pehle inkaa hissaa kramshah 63 pratishat or 72 fisadi tha jo aaj ghatakar mahaj 0
 6 percent and 1
 5 fisadi ho gaya he
 The ownership of the Singh brothers came to an end on both companies and they resigned from both firms in February 2018
 singh bandhuon ne aksar yah daawa kiya he ki enbiensi railigare or unke parivaar kii holding companiyaan donon, unke bharosemand sunil godhwani dwaara sanchalit or prabandhit kii jaati thim
 Shivinder and Malvinder said in an e-mail response that "godhwani took advantage of his position to deceive us and made many such transactions which led to our group being burdened with debt by 2016"
 ''haalanki, godhwani ke najdiki sutara bataate hai ki holding companiyon main unki koi aupchaarik bhoomika nahin thi or donon bhaaiyon ko sari baaten achche se pataa thim kyonki sabhi lenden par un donon ne hastakshar kiye the
 Questions related to this case were also sent to Godhwani in detail but he did not give any answer
 ek sachaai to yah bhi he ki fortis or railigare, donon hi companiyaan ranbaxy kii bikri se ai shuruaati nakadi kaa phayda uthaakar laaparvaaheepurn vistaar ke prayaason kii bhi doshi hai
 For example, Religare set a target of becoming a global financial powerhouse and lending (religare Finvest), capital markets (religare Securities), wealth management (asset management, insurance, housing loans as well as commodity sectors) i started spreading my feet fast
 haalanki adhikansh vyavsaayon main lagaaya gaya paisa dub gaya he, lekin railigare ko sabase zyada chapat uski sahyogi companiyon railigare capital markets or ligare aviation (godhwani ke bhai sanjay dwaara sanchalit) se lagi
 Even Fortis Healthcare, run by the Singh brothers, had set a goal of being a global player in the healthcare field
 singapore, honkong, australia, vietnam or dubai main iskaa vistaar hua, jiske liye 1 arab dollar se adhik ke adhigrahan ke liye vitt poshan hua
 Malvinder shifted his base to Singapore to manage business outside the country
 2010 main, singapore ke parkway aspataalon ke adhigrahan ke liye singh bandhu malaysia ke samprabhu fund khajaana ke saath adhigrahan kii ladaai main ulajh gaye
 The Singh brothers eventually had to retreat and sell their stake in Parkway to the treasury
 yah antarrashtriya adhigrahan or vistaar ranneeti main lagane vaale jhatkon kii ek shuruyaat thi or 2012-13 se unhone apana puraa dhyaan bhartiya bazaar par lagaaya
 "their m&a-driven global expansion strategy was probably devised without a better understanding of the complexities and challenges that come in the way of this large-scale expansion of such schemes," says Muralidharan Nair, consultant with Life Sciences, partner of Ernst & Young
 ''haalanki, fortis ko sabase tagada jhatka tab laga jab 473 karod ru

 This was a real setback for a company with a total revenue of Rs

 singh bhaaiyon kii is kahani ke iske alaava bhi kai or pahalu hai
 The largest of them is money given to Dhillon
 iske saath hi, unke upar court ke us order kii talwaar bhi latak rahi he jisamen unhen daichi ko 50 karod dollar kaa muaavja dena pad saktaa he or yah faisla kabhi bhi aa saktaa he
 If the verdict comes against the Singh brothers, all the money from Dhillon will go towards repaying it
 sawaal yah he ki kya maa nimmi ke hastkshep ke baavjood singh bandhu apane vivaadon ko hal karke bhavishya main milakar vyapaar karenge? shivinder isko lekar ekadam spasht hai: ''bhai se alag hokar kaarobaar kaa meraa faisla ab bhi apni jagah kaayam he
 "under pressure from the mother, the two brothers have met to resolve disputes
" sankat se ubarne ke raste khojane ke liye hui sandhi alpakaalik ho sakati he lekin aisa lagata he ki donon ke bich kii khai itani gahari khud chuki he jise bharna aasaan nahin he
 The effects of the recession made it difficult for both Fortis and Religare to pay heavy debts
 yah karj inhone apane vistaar ke dauraan liya tha

 This is the second largest bet of the Modi government after the upper caste reservation before the Lok Sabha elections

 padhein raashtrapati kaa puraa sandesh
 
 
 My dear countrymen, hamaare raashtra ke 67wein ganatantr diwas kii purv sandhya par, main bharat or videshon main based aap sabhi ko hardik badhai detaa hum
 i convey my special greetings to the members of our armed forces, paramilitary forces and internal security forces
 main un vir sainikon ke prati shradhanjali arpit karata hum jinhone bharat kii kshetreey akhandta kii raksha karne or vidhi shashan ko kaayam rakhane ke liye apana jivan balidaan kar diya
 Dear countrymen, 2
 Our Republic was born on 26 January 1950
 is din hamane swayan ko bharat kaa samvidhan diya
 On this day, the heroic struggle of an extraordinary generation of leaders reached the climax of conquering colonialism to establish the world's largest democracy
 unhone rashtriya ekta, jo hamen yahaan tak lekar ai he, ke nirmaan ke liye bharat kii vismayakari anekta ko sutarabaddh kar diya
 Permanent democratic institutions established by them have given us the gift to continue on the path of progress
 aaj bharat ek udiyaman shakti he, ek aisa desh he jo vigyaan, praudyogiki, navanveshan or start-ap main vishwa agrani ke rup main teji se ubhar rahaa he or jisaki aarthik safalataa vishwa ke liye ek kautuhal he
 Dear countrymen, 3
 The year 2015 has been a year of challenges
 is dauraan vishwa arthvyavastha main mandi rahi
 There was confusion over commodity markets
 sansthagat karrwai main anischitata ai
 In such a difficult environment, it cannot be easy for any nation to progress
 bhartiya arthvyavastha ko bhi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Fear of investors led to withdrawal of funds from other emerging markets including India, which put pressure on the Indian rupee
 hamaara niryaat prabhavit hua
 Our manufacturing sector is yet to fully emerge
 4
 In 2015, we were also deprived of the grace of nature
 bharat ke adhiktar hisson par bheeshan sookhe kaa asar padaa jabaki anya hisse vinaashkari baadh kii chapet main aa gaye
 Unusual weather conditions affected our agricultural production
 gramin rojgaar or aamadani ke str par bura asar padaa
 Dear countrymen, 5
 We can call these challenges because we are aware of them
 samasya kii pahchaan karnaa or iske samaadhaan par dhyaan dena ek shreshth gun he
 India is developing and implementing strategies to solve these problems
 is varsh 7
 With an estimated growth rate of 3 percent, India is on course to become the fastest growing large economy
 vishwa tel keemton main giravat se bahya kshetra ko sthir banaae rakhane or gharelu keemton ko niyantrit karne main madad mili he
 The industry has performed well this year despite frequent interruptions
 6
 Aadhaar is helping direct transfer of profits with current access to 96 crore people, preventing economic leakage and increasing transparency
 pradhanmantri jan dhan yojana ke tahat khole gaye 19 karod se zyada bank khate vittiya samaveshan ke maamle main vishwa kii akeli sabase vishaal prakriya he
 The aim of the MP Adarsh gram Yojana is to build Adarsh villages

 The goal of Pradhan Mantri Crop Insurance Scheme is the betterment of farmers
 mahatma gandhi rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee adhinium jaise kaaryakramon par badaye gaye kharch kaa uddeshy gramin arthvyavastha ko dobaaraa shashakt banane ke liye rojgaar main vruddhi karnaa he

 bharat main nirmaan abhiyaan se vyavsaay main sugamawa pradaan karke or gharelu udyog kii sparddha kshamta badhaakar vinirmaan tej hoga
 The Start-up India program will promote innovation and encourage new age entrepreneurship
 rashtriya kaushal vikaas mishan main 2022 tak 30 karod yuvaaon ko kushal banane kaa vichaar kiya gaya he
 8
 hamaare bich akasar ndehwaadee or aalochak honge
 We should keep complaining, demanding, protesting
 yah bhi loktantr kii ek visheshta he
 But we should also appreciate what our democracy has achieved
 buniyadi dhaanche, vinirmaan, swasthya, shiksha, vigyaan or praudyogiki main nivesh se, ham or adhik vikaas dar praapt karne kii behatar sthiti main hai jisase hamen agle das se pandrah varshon main garibi mitaane main madad milegi
 Dear countrymen, 9
 Respect for the past is an essential aspect of nationality
 hamaari utkrisht viraasat, loktantr kii sansthaaen sabhi nagarikon ke liye nyaay, samanta tathaa langik or aarthik samta sunishchit karti hai
 When disgusting incidents of violence hurt these established ideals, which are fundamental to our nationality, they need to be taken care of at the same time
 hamen hinsa, ashishnutaa or avivekpurna takaton se swayan kii raksha kerani hogi
 Dear countrymen, 10
 To strengthen the powers of development, we need reforms and progressive legislation
 yah sunishchit karnaa vidhi nirmaataaon kaa param kartavya he ki puure vichaar-vimarsh or paricharchaa ke baad aisa vidhaan lagu kiya jaae
 Cohesion, cooperation and consensus-making should be the dominant ways of decision making
 nirnay or karyanvayan main vilamb se vikaas prakriya kaa hi nuksaan hoga
 Dear countrymen, 11
 Peace is the prime objective of rational consciousness and our moral world
 yah sabhyataa kii buniyaad or aarthik pragati kii jarurat he
 But we have never been able to ask this small question: Why is it so far to achieve peace? Why has it been so difficult to establish peace more than to end the confrontation? 12
 At the end of the 20th century with a remarkable revolution in science and technology, we had some reason to hope that the 21st century would be an era in which the collective energy of the people and the country would be devoted to the ever-growing prosperity that was the first time of acute poverty
 Will remove the curse
 yah ummid is shatabdi ke pehle 15 varshon main feeki pad gai he

 13
 Terrorism is driven by insane motives, driven by the deepest depths of hate, it is instigated by puppets who are involved in the Holocaust through the massacre of innocent people

 Terrorism is not good or bad; This is only evil
 pyaare deshavaasiyon, 14
 desh har baat se kabhi sahamat nahin hoga; parantu vartmaan chunauti astitv se judi he
 Terrorists seek to undermine the system by rejecting recognized boundaries, the foundation of critical stability
 yadi apradhi simaaon ko todane main safal ho jate hai to ham araajaktaa ke yug kii ore bad jaaenge
 There can be disputes between countries and as we all know that the closer we are to the neighbor, the greater the possibility of dispute
 asahmati dur karne kaa ek sabhy tarika, samvaad he, jo sahi prakaar se kaayam rahanaa chahie
 But we cannot discuss peace amidst a barrage of bullets
 15
 We have a historic opportunity to become a pioneer for the world in our subcontinent during the terrible threat
 hamen apane padosiyon ke saath shantipurna vaarta ke dwaara apni bhaavnaatmak or bhu-raajnneetik dharohar ke jatil muddon ko sulajhane kaa prayaas karnaa chahie, or yah jaanate hue ek duusare kii samruddhi main vishwaas jataana chahie ki maanav kii sarvottam paribhaasha durbhaawanaaon se nahin balki sadbhaavna se di jaati he
 Our example can itself act as a message for a world in great need of friendship
 pyaare deshavaasiyon, 16
 bharat main har ek ko ek swasth, khushhaal or kaamyaab jivan jeene kaa adhikaar he
 This right is being violated, especially in our cities, where pollution has reached dangerous levels
 jalwaayu parivartan apane asli rup main saamne aayaa jab 2015 sabase garm varsh ke rup main darj kiya gaya
 Multiple strategies and actions are required at different levels
 shahari yojana ke navanveshi samaadhaan, svachh urja kaa prayog or logon kii maansikta main badlaav ke liye sabhi bhagidaaron kii sakriy hissedari jaruri he
 Only when adopted by people can the stability of these changes be ensured
 pyaare deshavaasiyon, 17

 Education, with its enlightening effect, produces human progress and prosperity
 yah bhaavnaatmak shaktiyaan viksit karne main sahaayta karti he jisase soi ummiden or bhula die gaye mulya dobaaraa jaagrath ho jate hai
 Dr
 sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne kaha tha, ‘shiksha kaa antim parinaam ek unmukt rachanashil manushya he jo aitihaasik paristhitiyon or prakritik vipadaaon ke viruddh lard saktaa he
 In order to create the "fourth Industrial Revolution" it is necessary that this free and creative human being controls the pace of change to assimilate the changes that are taking place within systems and societies
 ek aise maahaul kii aavashyaktaa he jo mahatvapurn vichaarsheelataa ko badhaava de or adhyaapan ko bauddhik rup se utsahvardhak banaae
 This will inspire scholarship and will increase deep respect for knowledge and teachers
 isse mahilaon ke prati aadar kii bhaavana paidaa hogi jisase vyakti jivan paryant saamaajik sadachaar ke maarg par chalegaa
 This will encourage a culture of deep thoughtfulness and create an atmosphere of contemplation and inner peace

 It has already begun with two Indian higher education institutions, ranked first in the world in the first two hundred

 Our Republic was born on 26 January 1950
 is din hamane swayan ko bharat kaa samvidhan diya
 On this day, the heroic struggle of an extraordinary generation of leaders reached the climax of conquering colonialism to establish the world's largest democracy
 unhone rashtriya ekta, jo hamen yahaan tak lekar ai he, ke nirmaan ke liye bharat kii vismayakari anekta ko sutarabaddh kar diya
 Permanent democratic institutions established by them have given us the gift to continue on the path of progress
 aaj bharat ek udiyaman shakti he, ek aisa desh he jo vigyaan, praudyogiki, navanveshan or start-ap main vishwa agrani ke rup main teji se ubhar rahaa he or jisaki aarthik safalataa vishwa ke liye ek kautuhal he
