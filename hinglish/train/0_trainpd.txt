 pakistani havers ne lagbhag 10 shikshan sansthaanon kii website hack kar lee hai
 Many of these news are hacked till the time of writing, while some websites have been restored
 hack kii gai websites main desh ke top santhaan shaamil hai
 Most of them are institutions that are associated with the Army and Defense
 hack kii gai websites main iaiti dilli, iaiti bhubaneshwar, dilli uniwarsity, neshnal airospes laboratries or aligarh muslim uniwarsity kii website shaamil hai
 Hackers have hacked these websites and written on them Zindabad
 iske alaava kashmir ke bare main bhi likhaa gaya he
 The hacked websites include mostly army and defense related educational institutions
 in websites kii hekking kaa daawa pakistan ke PHC group ne kiya he
 Let me tell you that last year, this same hacker group claimed to have hacked around 7100 websites in India
 kyon itani aasaani se hack ho gayi ye websitsajawab saaf he
 Almost all hacked websites do not have HTTPS and are not secure with SSL
 aisi websitsco hack karne ke liye kisi hekking certificate yaa phir blike hat training kii jarurat nahin hoti
 These websites can also hack script kiddies who do hacking through free tools from Google
 or mumkin he in havers ne bhi aisa kiya hoga
 However, it will be known only after the investigation report is received
 lekin pichhali baar jab bharat kii kai websites hack hui thim iske baad na koi jaanch report ai or na hi un websites ko sicyor kiya gaya he
 What could be the damage: The information is likely to be leaked after the website is hacked
 students kii jaankaree yaa phir college ke khaas aplication ke bare main jaankaree chori hone kii sambhaavna he
 The database associated with students is also very likely to be stolen
 kai baar havers website ko hack karke uske database ko crapt kar dete hai
 Not only this, if the hackers are successful in breaking the website's email server, then all the email ids and passwords associated with the website will be with the hackers
 iske alaava outluk damp file ke jariye puraane canvarseshan main send lagaai ja sakati he
 The websites of these institutes have been hacked, Delhi University, IIT Delhi, IIT Bhubaneswar, Aligarh Muslim University, National Aerospace Laboratories, Defense Institute of Advanced Technology, Army Institute of Management and Technology, University of Kota, Army Institute of Management Kolkata and Board of Research In Nuclear Science
 yah kahana he pakistani havers kaaise kathith pakistani haikar group ne apane fasebuk pej par hack kii gai sabhi websites ke link post kiye hai
 This Facebook post has written about Kashmir
 is kathith haikar group main post main likhaa he ki, ‘yah hekking code mandwara kii gai pakistani railway kii website hekkingke baad kii ja rahi he
 Also, this hacking has also been done against killing of Kashmiri people by Indian Army
 ’khabar likhe jane tak soochna mantralay kaa koi bayaan nahin aayaa he
 Therefore, it is not yet clear whether the front end of all these websites have been hacked or the back end has been breached in the server
 yah bhi saaf nahin he ki ye havers ne data churaayaa he yaa nahin

 In April 1916, Jinnah Sir Dinshaw went to East Himalayan Hill Station Darjeeling as a guest of Mankaji Petit on a two-month holiday after the Allahabad meeting

 Sir Dinshaw said that this is a brilliant idea and it will greatly help national unity
 jinna ne dhire se ratti kaa haath maang liya
 Hearing this, Sir Dinshaw was paralyzed, dismissed the idea as absurd, and took a stay order against the marriage from the High Court as Ratti was a minor at the time

 Angered by this, Jinnah said that only his wife could answer this question, she came forward and told the court that she became a Muslim for love, and neither she nor her husband wanted any share in her father's wealth

 xxrep 13 * Jinnah was unable to keep pace with street politics

 Jinnah felt that Gandhi had replaced him in the matter of getting affection for Muslims
 nagpur adhiveshan main ve iklaute muslim pratinidhi the jisane gandhi ke asahyog ke prastaav par asantosh prakat kiya
 He said that this proposal is a declaration of complete independence and India is not ready for it
 unhone kaha ki ve angreji hukumat par lala lajpat raay ke abhiyog se purnatah sahamat hai lekin unhen nahin lagata ki congress ne ise khatm karne kaa abhi koi tarika nikaala he

 You are placing such a program in front of the Indian National Congress which you cannot complete
 '' unki duusari aapatti thi ki ahimsa kargar nahin hogi
 Jinnah was in a misunderstanding here

 But Gandhi's newfound power did not compel him to take refuge in the mines he rejected

 After the non-cooperation Movement, he, like many other Congressmen belonging to different communities, left

 'mahatma' or 'moulana' ke dharmik nihitarthon ke maddenjar jinna ne gandhi or mohammad ali ke pehle in shabdon kaa prayog karne se inkaar kar diya
 In fact, the small group of Mullahs - Muhammad Ali, his brothers Shaukat Ali and Abul Kalam Azad - gave Gandhi an alternative way to touch Muslim sentiments and Gandhi linked the existence of Islam's last caliphate to the Indian cause

 khanij sampada se bharpoor he odisha ke jajpur jile kii changudipal gram panchayat
 Under this, Ballia, the two-year-old son of Sania Pradhan of Nagra village on the hill, did not even look at the world that he died last month
 vahiin shiva pradhan, babu pradhan or baaluu pradhan to apane navjaat bacchon kaa naam tak nahin soch paae the ki usase pehle hi ve chal based
 Within the last four months, the news of the death of 19 children and serious condition of 39 children in Nagda is shocking
 odisha main kuposhan kii maar kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki dakshin odisha ke navrangpur jile main beete chah maah main kuposhan se 355 bacchon kii maut ho chuki he or kareeb 3,359 bachche isaki chapet main hai
 These deaths have reminded the incident of hundreds of deaths due to starvation in Kalahandi
 jajpur ke hi sukinda block ke kaaliyapani sthit tata steel company ke aspataal main pichley dinon kareeb 39 bachche bhartee the
 But now only two children are left here
 baaki? andhvishwaas or ashiksha se grast nagada ke juang samudaay ke adivasee apane bacchon ko doctoron kii najaron se bachate-bachaate pahaad chadhakar gaanv le bhaage
 The hospital became vacant on 26 and 27 July
 odisha sarkaar kii ore se yahaan kuposhan ke shikaar bacchon ke liye nutrishanal rihabilitation centre kholaa gaya tha
 Now only one girl, Mansi, is being treated here
 adivasee, prashasan or aspataal ke bich kadi bane tata chromite plant ke adhikari shubhranshu bataate hai, ''aspataal ke alaava nagada main solar lite lagaai gayi or skool khole gaye hai
 "it seems, the Juang tribals are not ready to take any kind of facilities
" ve jangal-pahaad chhodkar neeche aane se kataraate hai or jhadfoonk karne waalon se apane bacchon kaa ilaaj karaate hai
 The hilly area of sukinda block is the center of activities of Kaliapani mining companies
 yaheen se durgam jangal or jharanon se hote hue kareeb 12 kimi chadh kar durgam raaston se nikal satkuiyaan pahari par based nagada gaanv tak pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 To know the reality of Nagda, when we started climbing the mountain, all the governmental aspects related to the tribals began to be revealed
 bachaav oparation pahaad ke neeche debgaanv se chalaaya ja rahaa tha
 Seven kilometers further up the mountain, the small settlement Naliya Dob was a stop for commuters
 nagada pahunchane par vahaan jila prashasan ke do camp dikhaai dete hai
 Only employees were able to reach here
 colector es
 K
 malik maatahat afasaron ke saath ek kimi tak jaise-taise aae par thakkar laut gaye
 Panchayat officer Dharmendra Kumar Sahu, who is handling the camp, says that children are being given nutrients
 camp se hi pataa chalaa ki anganwari kaaryakarta ne chaar maheene pehle bal vikaas pariyojna adhikari tilottama mahapaatr ko ek report ke madhyam se is sankat ko lekar aagaah kiya tha
 This report was sent to Tilottama Collector Office
 malik bataate hai, ''haa, bukhaar kii shikaayat thi
 "if the administration had been alerted four months ago, at least a dozen children's lives could have been saved
 rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ne bhi colector se report talab kii he
 People from the government department posted on the mountain tell that officers and leaders come and go to Tata's hospital
 asli kaam to karmchaaree karte hai
 In the mineral-rich Sukinda block, nine large mining companies like OMC, Infa, Faker, Sarvabil, Kamarda are working around Nagra, but no company other than Tata came forward to help the tribal children who are struggling with death
 nagada gaanv kii teenon bastiyon (upree, madhya or nichali) ke bachche rogiyon jaise dikhaai padate hai
 Big belly, dry hands and feet, head to body ratio and dry shrunken skin give a proof of their malnourishment by screaming
 nagada main paanch raahat shivi hai par unka laabh adivaasiyon ko mil rahaa he, iske koi sanket nahin dikhte
 When asked, government employees curse the tribals, saying, "these people are not ready to take the facility
" afasar pahaad par aate nahin, hame pareshaan kiya jaataa he
 "the reason for this malnutrition is being attributed to child marriages and unhealthy mothers
" prajnan main kam antar, kuposhan or andhvishwaas bhi juang naunihaalon kii maut kaa kaaran ban rahaa he
 Healthy and safe motherhood is a dream for women dependent on rice and salt or wild fruits
 ek sarkari afasar kehete hai ki media main na uchhla hota to yah bakheda na khadaa hota
 Desa resident here says, "we cut wood and sell it
" iske alaava chaaval or makka uga lete hai
 “tribals want facilities but do not want to leave their forest land
 shivi main tainaat gram panchayat adhikari dharmendra sahu kehete hai, ''ye log pahaad ke neeche rahane aa jaaen to sarkaar pakkaa ghar yojana ke tahat ghar, shiksha, swasthya seva, jameen kaa patta sab kuch dene ko taiyaar he par ye lene ko taiyaar nahin
 "mousa Prabhu Pradhan says," The forest gives us to eat Kantalu, Pittalu, Tunga, Gudva, Mahua
 yah paushtik he yaa nahin, ham kya jaane?'' maheene main ek baar pahaad se 12 kimi neeche jaakar rupaya kilo ke hisaab se apane rashancard kaa chaaval le aate hai
 Nagda, Guiyansal, Aradapal, Nataur, Chungubipal, Ragda, Pudagowda villages are inhabited on the mountain, but the conditions there also do not look very good
 in gaanvon main lagbhag 7,500 aabaadi he
 There are about 1,409 houses which have been given ration cards
 jaagrukta kii kami kaa alam yah he ki bacchon kii maut ko bhi ve halke main lete hai
 Rabi Juang, who lost her eight-month-old son, Kabul, says, "these children are the gift of God, given by him, taken back
" '' sukinda ke vidhayak pritiranjan ghadi bataate hai ki nagada tak sadak paas ho gai he
 If they believe, development and awareness is the lifeblood of the Juang tribals
 rapid survey on children report ke mutabik, rajya main 5 saal tak kii umr ke 46 pratishat adivasee bachche kuposhan kii chapet main hai
 According to the standard, Odisha is at number 16 in the country in terms of weight of children
 vahiin aayran or folic acid kii khuraaq 39
 Only 3 percent of tribal children get it
 jaahir he, bacchon or maataaon ke swasthya maanak par rajya behad pichhadaa hua he
 Government negligence and lack of awareness among the people has made the situation worse
 agar yahi haal rahaa to naunihaalon kaa bhagwaan hi maalik he

 gadhaa kitna hi biimaar ho, bhookha ho, thakaa ho, lekin agar maalik usase kaam letaa he to sabakuch sahan karte hue maalik kaa diya kaam puraa karke hi rahata he'

 Akhilesh was surrounded by his statement in such a way that he could not be made to reply, he wanted to get rid of this statement but as if the BJP was waiting for it, and he did not delay in cashing it
 yahi nahin, piem modi ne akhilesh ke 'gadhaa' bayaan par rahul gandhi ko bhi lapete main le liya
 He said that the UPA government has issued stamp stamp after taking inspiration from donkeys
 iske alaava gujarat ke sambandh gandhi or sardaar patel jaise netaaon se jodate hue modi ne kaha, 'akhilesh ji jahaan ke gadhon kii baat kar rahe hai, wo vahi jagah he jahaan gandhi, sardaar patel ne janm liya, krishna ne use apni karmbhumi banaaya
 'now after the election results, people have started saying that Akhilesh's' donkey' statement has become a livelihood for the BJP and after the initial stages, BJP has campaigned on this statement as well as other statements of coalition leaders

 bijepi kaa aarope he ki yah darasal gift nahin balki benami sampatti or rishwat kaa maamla he
 Sushil Modi came to the press conference the day he said that Lalu took bribe in return for giving jobs to people and in exchange for making a minister
 lekin jab lalu yadav se poocha gaya ki bhala har koi unhen gift par gift or jameen par jameen kyon de rahaa he to lalu yadav kaa kahana tha ki agar koi mujhe apni sampatti gift main dena chahta he to duusare logon ke pet main dard kyon ho rahaa he
 Lalu argues that giving gifts is not illegal at all
 bijepi ke aarope ke bare main poochne par bhadak kaa lalu kehete hai ki kya bijepi ke log bhikhmange hai? wo log is laayak he hi nahin ki unhen koi gift de
 He claims that the charge of getting land in the gift is old and has been investigated many times, but nothing proved
 saath main ve yah bhi jodate hai ki gift kaa maamla uchhaalkar kanti singh or raghunatha jha jaise logon ko badnaam karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 On Wednesday, Lalu Yadav came to Delhi to attend an opposition meeting about the presidential election
 baithak ke baad lalu ne kaha ki pehle bijepi apane ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa kar le uske baad vah log apana aglaa kadam tay karenge
 Lalu Yadav quipped that Modi's mentor has been Advani, but he does not think Advani will get Guru Dakshina
 kya adwani kaa naam saamne aayaa to lalu unka samarthan karenge yah sawaal puche jane par lalu yadav koi saaf jawaab to nahin dete lekin itnaa kehete hai ki raashtrapati ko lekar vah log vichaardhaara se samjhauta bilkul nahin karenge
 The daughter-in-law should be able to run the house well
 a statement of Goddess Devi is in the news nowadays in which she said that for her sons she is looking for a daughter who does not go to the mall and cinema
 lalu yadav se jab poocha gaya ki vah kisi bahu chaahate hai to unka jawaab tha kii bahu kisi honi chahie jo sanskari ho or ghar ko achche se chalaa sake
 Lalu says that it is very important that the boy and the girl like each other but at the same time they also say that they would like to marry their children

 Many people have become patients of kidney stone due to everyday runaway and chaotic lifestyle
 pathari main yun to koi pareshaani nahin hoti he lekin jab iskaa dard uthta he to wo asahneeya ho jaataa he
 Although there may be other causes of appendicitis, but mostly it is due to food and drink problem
 namak or sharir ke duusare khanij jab ek-duusare ke sampark main aate hai to pathari banane lagati he
 It has no fixed size
 kai baar to ye itane chote hote hai ki ureen ke saath hi baahar nikal jate hai lekin kai baar inkaa aakaar hairaan kar dene vaala hota he
 There are many types of stone but the most common is the stone made of calcium

 Avoid the consumption of oxalate
 If you have a problem of stones, then do not overdose such things in which there is a quantity of oxalate
 paalak, sabut anaaj aadi main oxlate paryaapt maatra main paaya jaataa he
 Avoid eating them

 5
 in shaak-subjiyon se karen parhezin poshak tatwon ke saath hi kuch aisi subjiyan he jinke beej stone ke kaaran ban sakate hai

 NCP (nationalist Congress Party) chief Sharad Pawar has said in gestures that power has become centralized during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure and this situation will lead to emergency
 unhone kaha ki sirf ek vyakti ke haathon main saare haq dene se loktantr par sankat mandaraane lagata he
 Sharad Pawar citing the example of Emergency said that India defeated Pakistan under the leadership of Indira Gandhi and Bangladesh was formed
 is safalataa ke baad desh indira gandhi ke samarthan main khadaa ho gaya tha lekin phir kisi kii galat salaah yaa galat nirnay kii vajah se satta kaa kendrikaran hua or parinaam apatkaal ke rup main dekhne ko mila
 The decision of demonetisation is not the right of Modi, Pawar further said that even today when the Prime Minister goes on a foreign trip, big leaders of BJP in Delhi take a sigh of peace
 aise hi halaat hamane 1977 main anubhav kiye the
 Sharad Pawar also targeted PM Narendra Modi for the decision on demonetisation
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ne jo notebandi kaa nirnay liya tha wo unhen lene kaa adhikaar bilkul nahin tha
 This right is only and only with the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India
 pavaar ne kaha ki aaj desh main halaat bhaybheet karne vaale hai
 Murders are happening in the name of cow protection
 jammu-kashmir main bhi mushkil halaat hai
 Pawar, who advised the people of Pakistan to be sent to Pakistan in the name of nationalism with respect to Indians, said that those who say so do not know that the heart of the citizens of Pakistan and Hindustan beats the same
 pavaar ne bataaya ki bataur ICC adhyaksh unhone kai baar pakistan kaa daura kiya or har baar unhen mahasoos hua ki pakistan ke logon ke dil main bharatiyon ko lekar sammaan or prem he
 In contrast, the Pakistani army and the ruling compulsion get involved in a dispute with India and military aggression
 darasal, unhen bhi pakistan kii avam par raaj karnaa he
 Regarding the Bolemratha reservation on Maratha reservation, Sharad Pawar said that the condition of farmers of the state is not good
 vahiin yuva aarthik sankat kii vajah se dasvin ke baad padhai se vanchit rah rahe hai
 Therefore, it is requested by the state government to give reservation to Maratha society keeping the reservation given to SC, ST and OBC

 saamaanya varg ko aarakshan dene vaale is bill ke paas hone ke baad ab maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ko shaikshik sansthaanon main ise lagu karne ke kai kadam uthaane honge

 Taking cognizance of the news of the woman who gave birth to her child on a pavement, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday ordered the state government to give her complete information about the condition of the infant
 adaalat ne sarkaar se kaha he ki vah is baat kii bhi puri jaankaree de ki usne bachche ko upachaar dene ke liye kya kadam uthaae hai
 a division bench of Justice Deepak Mishra and Justice Manmohan has asked the government to inform him about the condition of the child on Wednesday afternoon
 15 baje tak jaankaree dene ke liye kaha tha
 The court also asked the government to explain what is the government's stand on the adoption of that child by a woman who was trying to adopt that child
 pehali baar is raashtra kii saarvajanik rajnatik kalpana kaa hissaa bane ek pratik ke sau saal baad or aazaadee ke 68 saal baad aaj hamase kaha ja rahaa he ki ham nae sire se bharat mata kii saughandh khaaen
 Now that this demand is being imposed on us without any scope of any kind of debate or disagreement, the time has come for us to ask some questions: for example, who is in this mythical picture of the motherland; When and how did this picture come into existence; And in what context did this picture take the political role of the organizational symbol of nationalism? These questions have to be answered immediately because the concept of a nation in a feminine form, whether human or divine, is neither natural nor axiomatic and of course, it is not eternal at all
 samrudh rajnatik virodhabhasis raashtra ke amoort secular adarsh ne upasna ke uddeshy se jis tareeke se ek maanavarupi chhavi kii talash karke uski deh ko desh ke maanchitr par uker diya, us prakriya main ek samrudh rajnatik virodhabhas nihit he
 This new goddess on earth comes in the early twentieth century, who finds herself in a place for herself
 mudrit madhyam kii lokapriy tasveeron main jaise-jaise yah tasviir prasaarit hoti gai, vaise-vaise ek devi ke rup main mathrubhumi ko maanchitr par dikhaaya janaa shuru hua
 It served to provide freshness to our geographical and administrative claims
 uski deh or maanchitr kaa fark dhire-dhire mitata gaya, phir bharat mata ne apane irdagird tirange or ashok stambh jaise duusare rashtriya secular pratikon ko ikattha karnaa shuru kar diya
 Sometimes this mixed landscape has become so visionary that it becomes difficult to live without being attracted to it
 masalan, 1962 main bharat mata kii ek tasviir prakashit hui jisamen dikhaaya gaya tha ki khandit ashok stambh kii suraksha mata ke kuch sher kar rahe hai or mata china ke saath jang main bharat kii sarhadon kii suraksha kar rahi he
 Sumati Ramaswamy, in his book The Gods and the nationru Mapping Mother India, mentions this strong combination of 'scientific-geographical' and 'anthropomorphic-sacred' elements in the process of envisaging the country
 dharmanirpeksh or dharmik ke isi sammishran ke chalate yah tasviir itnaa apil karti he or ek bahudharmik raashtra ke pratik ke bataur apni upyuktata bhi siddh karti he
 Despite this there has never been any doubt of the Hindu religious euphemisms sufficiently clear in this picture
 bharat mata kaa yah pratik lokapriy ugr rashtrawaad ke kandhe par chadhakar beesvin sadi ke aarambhik dashakon main tab failaa jab raajnneeti main samarpan kii bhaavana kaa pravesh ho chukaa tha or raashtra kii ek nai divine chhavi gadhane kii koshish kii ja rahi thi
 Mythical photographs were a soft tool to cover up anti-colonial revolution sentiments to avoid colonial sanctions, especially the picture of the Indian goddess slaying the demon
 aise bani mathrubhumi kii tasvirbengal main swadeshi andolan ke shikhar daur main rabindranath tagore ke upanyaas ghare bire kaa rashtravaadi nayak sandip apni premika bimala se kahata he, ''is desh kaa bhugol purna satya nahin he
 No one can stake their life on a map
 hamaare deshavaasiyon main sachhee deshbhakti tab tak nahin ubharegi jab tak ki ve ek mathrubhumi kii pariklpana na kar saken—hamen use devi kaa rup dena hi hoga!'' is tarah ek mahila se devi bani or mathrubhumi ko ek devi kii tasviir se darshaya gaya, jo bharat ke maanchitr se ubharkar saamne aati he or apane shahid beton ke balidaan ko sweekaar karti he
 a picture of Abanindranath Tagore showed Bharat Mata
 is akruti ko bada karke silk ke ek binar par lagaaya gaya or rabindranath tagore ke rashtrabhakti vaale geeton kii dhun kaa sahaara lete hue kolkata ke swadeshi andolan main isse paisa jutaney kaa kaam liya gaya
 The political use of this image remained brief because later a far greater number of printed images ejected it from the public psyche
 kalantar main kaaphi gahare rangon main is tasviir ko is tarah bade paimaane par chapa gaya ki vah bhadakaau prathit hone lagi—isamen devi ke irdagird vibhinn rashtriya nayakon ke chehre lage hue hai jinhen faansee par lataka diya gaya, yaa phir uski god main gandhi ko dikhaaya gaya jinke sharir se khun ris rahaa he
 Here a fictitious galaxy of heroes who created the history of the national movement stood on its head
 jaahir he, raashtra ke bhadkile, lokranjak or mithkeey nirupan par sawaal khadaa karne waalon ke liye yah pratik asahaj karne vaala tha
 Rabindranath Tagore's literary decline began due to similar representations of the motherland
 unke nayak sandip ne anjaane main hi aisa pratik chun liya tha or use andaja nahin tha ki raashtra kii upasna jaisaa bhaavnaatmak rechan badi aasaani se nafrat or sanak kii raajnneeti main bhi tabdeel ho ja saktaa he
 Was any more secular metaphor of the representation of the nation possible than a map and flag sign? One of the possibilities of this is found in the representation of the map as Motherland in 1937 in which Bharat Mata is wearing a tricolor sari, embroidered with a charkha on the edge and in the background of the Congress flags, caps and leaders of the national movement
 Are giving isse ek saal pehle 1936 main mahatma gandhi ne banaras ke bharat mata mandir main raashtra ke ek or kahin zyada sahaj pratik kaa anaavaran kiya tha, jisamen kisi maanviya chhavi kii bajaae desh kaa vishaal nakshaa farsh par leta hua dikhaaya gaya he
 The attempt to build this map in Banaras, the stronghold of Hinduism, was conscious so that the boundaries of the country itself could be represented as a symbol within which people of all religions, castes and creeds resided
 aaj ham desh ke itihaas ke duusare sudur chor par khadey hai jahaan hamen khud se yah sawaal poochne ko majaboor kiya gaya he ki aakhir raashtra kii yah duusari pariklpana jameen par tike rahane main kyon naakaam ho gai? aakhir kya vajah he ki bharat ke maanchitr kaa vah vishisht mandir bhula diya gaya or saarvajanik smriti main uski jagah aakhir kaise aadhi sadi baad haridwar main vishwa hindu parishad ke banawaye usee ke ek hamanaam mandir ne le lee? assi ke dashak main hindutvvaadi rashtrawaad ke jowar ke bich bharat mata kii mudrit madhyam main sadaa se chhapati rahi vah tasviir achaanak sangemarmar ke ek mandir main sthapit kar di gai or banaras ke maanchitr vaale mandir ke upar usne apana prabhutv sthapit kar liya
 Thus we were lifted from the past of anti-colonial nationalism and thrown into the current state-sponsored majoritarian history of nationalism
 aaj bharat mata kii tasviir vafadari sabit karne kii vastuham kah sakate hai ki bharat mata kaa pratik aaj apana safar mukammal kar chukaa he
 Geeti Sen, a history of art, writes about it that this symbol once used religion to organize the country as a nation, today it resorted to nationalism to organize the country under one religion
 Used to be
 yah badlaav vidambnaaon se bharaa hua he
 In the British era, the picture of Mother India used to be a thing of love and affection, but today it has become an object of proving loyalty
 aaj isi ke bahaane deshbhakti or naagarikta kii nai paribhaashaayen gadhi ja rahi hai
 The biggest irony of these is the law of 'treason' which is the legacy of the colonial state
 aazaadee se pehle mathrubhumi ke mithkeey chitratmak nirupan par rajdroh lagaaya jaataa tha, aaj kaa raashtra-rajya is kanoon kaa istemaal har us vyakti ke khilaaf kar rahaa he jo is pratik ko sweekaar karne se manaa karata he
 Who is responsible for the fragmented map of this nation after partition? Who has the right to live in this tightly-guarded nation-state, while being constantly restless about possible attacks on its geography? Just as anyone can be held 'anti-national' anytime from 'patriot', so slipping into punishments while celebrating this nation is also an imminent situation
 marhoom kalakaar makabool fida hossain ko kuch isi tarah mathrubhumi ke nirupan ke apane adhikaar kii keemat chukaani padi thi-aazaadee kii pachaasavin saalagirah par 1997 main unhone bharat ke nakshe kaa ek utsaahi yuva kii tarah chithran kiya tha jisamen ganesh or gandhi ke sketch the,bahumanjila imaaraten tani hui thim or hawaii jahaaj ud rahe the; lekin 2005 main raashtra kii yah chhavi acroshit, raktabh or nagn akruti main tabdeel ho gai
 The mutilated body of the motherland and the traces of the cities on its torso where riots and massacres took place — this picture was seen as a planned act of a 'muslim' artist who has dismembered Mother India
 uske baad hossain ko daraane-dhamkaane kaa silsilaa shuru hua or hindu dakshinpanthiyon ne unhen nirvaasan main dhakel diya, jahaan se ve kabhi bhi laut nahin sake
 The motherland evicted this particular citizen in the same way as she is threatening to do every citizen who completely rejects her symbol
 pratik kaa ateetbharat mata par maujuuda rajnatik bahason ke maddenjar kolkata kaa victoria memorial haul aadhunik kala kaa apana ek sangrah (rabindranath bharti socity se lekar) saamne laane ja rahaa he jisane kai myanon main is pratik ko janm diya tha
 Abanindranath Tagore's 'wash' painting, displayed as the artwork of the month, presents the motherland as a ascetic figure of renunciation and liberation
 ise banaate vakt kalakaar ke dimag main yah baat thi ki vah bharat raashtra ke liye pehali baar ek 'kalatmak' pratik kaa nirmaan kar rahaa he jo na to dharmik he or na hi rajnatik
 Through this figure, the work of raising money in the Swadeshi movement of Kolkata was taken
 is chhavi kaa rajnatik istemaal sankshipt hi rahaa
 Writer Tapti guha-thakurta is director at Kolkata's Center for Studies in Social Sciences KPS Gill will be remembered for his service to our nation in the fields of policing & security

 There will be no major leader in this Gothic style building of the college because a lot of work has to be done before leaving
 yah imaarat aaj tak apane dam par tiki hui he, jaise sanskrit apane dam par aaj tak tiki hui he
 The history of modern Sanskrit education begins with the history of this college

 If Sanskrit did not create political sentiment in the Indian psyche, they would not even cry in his name, but knowing that at the time of the swearing-in ceremony, they must express that the oath is taken in Sanskrit

 prabhaav, dushprabhav or tatkaal prabhaav
 These students are also demanding to conduct student union elections

 If you did not go in the sit-in demonstration, or do not sit, then know that you did not live a democratic life
 yahaan karmchaaree union or profasar bhi dharne par baithe hai

 The slogan of every Mahadev is also chanted here
 loktantric sangharshon ko bhi urja har har mahadev se milti he, magar aisa nahin he ki karmchaaree ekta zindaabad ke naaron kaa vajood mit gaya he
 The contribution of Sampoornanand Sanskrit University is so much that the governments have been given life in respect of the same, otherwise it seems that no effort will be left to shut it down

 Which region of India belonging to or affiliated with Sampoornand Sanskrit College will have no school or college? 550 vidhyalay isse sambhddha hai
 The rules for recognition are simple
 dedh acre zamin ho, paanch saat kamare ho librari ho, khel kaa maidan ho to aap sanskrit santhaan khol sakate hai
 All this is in the Sampurnanand Sanskrit Mahavidlaya of Banaras since 1791, but you have just seen its condition

 The beauty of this building itself could have been primed separately but it would be unfair with the Sanskrit education going on within it and the dreams of Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga who donated such a beautiful building to Sanskrit would be lost

 After four months of the 2017-18 season, advertisements have been released for the remaining season so that the process of their selection can begin

 There are so many ruins what to show what to hide

 Do you think that you are going to be aware of higher education, i want to tell you one thing for ordinary people

 If you ask for it, then the leaders will mislead you about the cost of the statue and the boundary of the cemetery

 Even though she is shabby, no one has erased her marks yet

 Now see that the Professor was walking around India checking the attendance of the Principal, but it turned out that the Commission headed to grant grants to the University is the top chief

 sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay
 The college was established in 1791, the first four principals were English
 1958 main uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri sampoornanand ne uniwarsity kaa rup de diya
 Look at the building of this college, it will look like you have come to London, not Banaras and Kyoto
 bahut kam college honge jinaki imaarat iske jaise hogi
 There will be no major leader in this Gothic style building of the college because a lot of work has to be done before leaving
 yah imaarat aaj tak apane dam par tiki hui he, jaise sanskrit apane dam par aaj tak tiki hui he
 The history of modern Sanskrit education begins with the history of this college
 1791 main lord cornwalis ne isaki manzuri di thi or prastaav tha east india company ke jonathan dancan kaa
 Pandit Kashinath was its first teacher
 doctor vailemtine ne yahaan angl sanskrit vibhaag kii sthapana kii thi
 For the whatsapp University ministers, leaders and their supporters, let me tell you that these are not the valentines that they oppose every 14 February
 dow
 RTS Griffith became its first principal
 griphith ne hi balmiki ramayana kaa anuwaad angrezi main kiya tha
 a lot of work was done here during the time of Dr
 Ganga Nath Jha
 yah imaarat itnaa to bataati he ki sanskrit shiksha kii shuruyaat bhi behtareen tareeke se hue ab aage jo kahani yah imaarat aapako sunaane ja rahi he use sunakar aapako khushi hogi ki sanskrit ke maamle main bhi aapke netao ne aapako niraash nahin kiya he
 If Sanskrit did not create political sentiment in the Indian psyche, they would not even cry in his name, but knowing that at the time of the swearing-in ceremony, they must express that the oath is taken in Sanskrit
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh jab sampoornanand sanskrit mahavidhyalay gaye to vahaan vishwa vidhyalay ke sabhi mahatpavurna angon ke sanghathan dharne par baithe the
 Ajay Singh was confronted by four dharna in a campus, on the same day
 yah vaaki gaurav kii baat he ki chaar dharne main se ek dharna is baat ko lekar tha jis baat ko lekar prime time kii yah series kai dinon se chal rahi he
 Shortage of teachers and non-running of classes led to indefinite strike of students
 laal rang ke binar par is naare ne meraa dil jeet liya
 For the first time anywhere, the students were sitting on an indefinite strike against the shortage of teachers and not taking classes
 dharna jab bemiyadi ho jaae to use siriyasli lenaa hi chahie
 The slogans of the banners in the hands of the students show that the students are also grappling with the widespread problems of India which have come to their university
 dallalon se mukti bharat kii sanathan samasya he, jisase ladane vaale abhi tak is dharti se mukt nahin hue hai
 These students are also demanding the end of epidemics like dynasty and regionalism
 rikt padon par niyukti ke alaava araajaktaa failaane kii jaanch kii bhi maang inke binar uthaa rahe hai
 Written in the corner of the student power and national power banner
 dharm kii jai ho or adharm kaa vinaash ho
 There should be goodwill among the students and welfare of the university
 kalyaan kii kaamana sanskrit shiksha kaa abhinn ang he
 Congratulations to the students for their democratic power
 chaatro kii samasyaayein itani hai ki unhen uthaane ke liye alag alag guton kii bhi aavashyaktaa he
 To fulfill this, a different faction is demanding the construction of this broken road
 yah sadak chatravaas se uniwarsity ke kendriya karyaalay tak jaati he
 There is no need to be sad to see the condition of the road, because now you have to bear the brunt of the condition of the hostel
 ek binar maang kar rahaa he ki sadak nirmaan avilamb ho
 Facing delay, our students are giving comfort of their endurance without any delay
 chatravaason kii sundarikaran va marammat tatkaal prabhaav se kiya jaae
 There are three types of influence in India
 prabhaav, dushprabhav or tatkaal prabhaav
 These students are also demanding to conduct student union elections
 do or dharne chal rahe hai
 If you did not go in the sit-in demonstration, or do not sit, then know that you did not live a democratic life
 yahaan karmchaaree union or profasar bhi dharne par baithe hai
 The Government of India should issue a Democracy Report every year, stating which action took place after which demonstration, which demonstration did not yield results and which performance will never result
 karmchaaree union or shikshakon kaa bhi dharna chalate dekh ajay singh ko laga ki bhale hi system ne is uniwarsity ko biimaar kar diya ho magar loktantr ke antibiotic kaa asar ab bhi yahaan ke shikshakon main baaki he
 Like students here, the enthusiasm is less, the elderly are old and many have black bags
 kaala bag jab kandhe par latak jaae tab samajhie sarkari naukari kaa jivan safal ho gaya he
 i have come under the banyan since i am old
 sitambar maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 The school has not received a grant since 2010
 jiske kaaran koi kaam nahin ho paa rahaa he
 The slogan of every Mahadev is also chanted here
 loktantric sangharshon ko bhi urja har har mahadev se milti he, magar aisa nahin he ki karmchaaree ekta zindaabad ke naaron kaa vajood mit gaya he
 The contribution of Sampoornanand Sanskrit University is so much that the governments have been given life in respect of the same, otherwise it seems that no effort will be left to shut it down
 uniwarsity ke bheetar kaa praathmik aspataal band he, jise chaalu karaane ke liye andolan chal rahe hai
 Now we will go towards the hostel
 ham chaahate hai ki thodi dur chup rahe or aap shanti se tasveeron ke zarie bina aansu bahaae rote rahe
 Crying is also of many types
 bina aansu ke ronaa hi is vakt uchit rahegaa
 In the pictures you will see the toilet but not clean India
 isse ghabaarane kii zarurat nahin he ki kyonki chaatro ne paan kii peak ke liye ek konaa khoj liya he
 The condition of the common room is the same as yours
 kaaman room kii dhahati chat kii parvaah kiye bagair chaatr news channel dekh rahe hai, ise dekh kar aapako acha lagegaa
 That we might not be able to do anything
 propeganda dekh rahe hai
 After listening to all these, would you also like to know how many teachers are there in Sampurnanand Sanskrit College and how many are not
 yahaan 24 vibhaag hai, 5 sankaay hai
 The names of subjects and departments are Grammar, Astrology, Literature, Purana, Mimamsa, Vedanta, Comparative Religion, Buddhism, Jainism and Pali
 in sab kii uchit padhai ke liye
 There should be 118 teachers, but 46 are there, 72 are not
 bahaali kaa vigyaapan niklaa he, magar chayan prakriya par vivaad he
 Which region of India belonging to or affiliated with Sampoornand Sanskrit College will have no school or college? 550 vidhyalay isse sambhddha hai
 The rules for recognition are simple
 dedh acre zamin ho, paanch saat kamare ho librari ho, khel kaa maidan ho to aap sanskrit santhaan khol sakate hai
 All this is in the Sampurnanand Sanskrit Mahavidlaya of Banaras since 1791, but you have just seen its condition
 hamaari yah puri series enditivi kii website or fasebuk pej par he
 You see and show how the national project of ruining the youth of India is going on
 yahaan bhi niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee ke aarope lag rahe hai
 Sanskrit was another center of education, it will happen and it will happen
 
 
 bihar kaa darbhanga
 The beauty of this building itself could have been primed separately but it would be unfair with the Sanskrit education going on within it and the dreams of Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga who donated such a beautiful building to Sanskrit would be lost
 isliye imaarat kii murtiyon jhaadphanus par mohit mat ho jaaiyegaa, apane kaleje ko bachaakar rakhie, badahaal sanskrit ke haal par chirane ke kaam aayega
 Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga donated 37 bighas of land including Lakshmishwar Vilas Palace for the development of oriental learning
 isi imaarat main maharaj kaa darbar laga karata tha, unka janm bhi yaheen hua tha
 Special efforts were also made in 1961 by the then Chief Minister of Bihar Shri Krishna Singh and the immediate Governor Zaqir Hussain
 ashwamegh yajna ke ghode kii tarah bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon kii grading karne nikle NAAC ke kaaran hi imaarat ko rang diya gaya he

 aapako lagata he ki shiksha mantri log kaam karte honge
 Recently google the education ministers statement
 aapako shiksha par kam, netagiri par zyaada milegaa
 Sanskrit is being erased in the name of saving
 pramod gupta jab kameshwar vishvavidhyalay se maatr ek kilometre dur ek or college gaye to jo dekha wo aap dekh lijie
 You will earn more than a hundred pilgrimages

 You have now come to Darbhanga's Mohalla Harahi Pokhar West Sankat Mochan Dham
 sadak kinare chal rahaa chah kamaron ke is college kaa naam vidyanand mithila sanskrit mahavidhyalay
 Vidyanand ji donated land for this college, later his family members also captured some part of it
 mere hisaab se acha kiya
 The college building from outside is telling that taking oath in Lok Sabha in the name of Sanskrit does not benefit Sanskrit
 jab pramod ji pahunche to patrkaar ko aayaa dekh is chaatra ko kahin se bula laayaa gaya or class chaalu karaayaa gaya
 The good thing is that there are ten people in this college, including the principal and the teacher
 pramod ji ne chaatr upasthiti panjika kaa ek panna palata to koi chaatr kisi bhi din absent hi nahin dikhaa
 Attendance has its own glory in India
 aap ho na hon atendence lag jaae to koi sabit nahin kar saktaa he ki aap is duniya main hi nahin the

 There is an important information from Madhya Pradesh
 rajya ke sarkari sangeet evam lalit kala mahavidhyalayon ke liye atithi vidwaanon kii niyukti kaa vigyaapan aayaa he
 The visiting scholar calls the scholar who is a scholar but goes as a invited guest so that he can be banished after paying honorarium

 Sampoornananda Sanskrit University
 is college kii sthapana 1791 main kii gai thi, iske shuru ke chaaron principal angrez hi the
 In 1958, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Sampurnanand gave the shape of the university
 is college kii imaarat dekhiegaa, aisa lagegaa aap banaras or kioto nahin, landan aa gaye hai
 There will be very few colleges whose buildings will be like this
 gothic style main bani is college kii imaarat main koi bada netaa nahin jayega kyonki jane se pehle bahut kaam karnaa hoga
 This building rests on its own till date, just as Sanskrit rests on its own till date
 aadhunik sanskrit shiksha kaa itihaas is college ke itihaas se shuru hota he
 It was approved by Lord Cornwallis in 1791 and was proposed by Jonathan Duncan of the East India Company
 pandit kashinath iske pehle shikshak hue the
 Doctor Valentin established the Anglo Sanskrit Department here
 whatsap uniwarsity ke mantri, netaa or unke samarthakon ke liye bataa duun ki ye wo vailemtine nahin hai jinka ve har 14 farvari ko virodh karte hai
 Dr
 aar tii es griphith iske pehle principal bane
 It was Griffith who translated the Balmiki Ramayana into English
 doctor ganga nath jha ke samay main bhi yahaan kaaphi kaam hua tha
 This building tells so much that even the beginning of Sanskrit education has started in a good way, now you will be happy to hear the story that this building is going to tell you that even in the case of Sanskrit, your leaders have not disappointed you
 sanskrit agar bhartiya maanas main raajnneetik bhavukta paidaa na karti to uske naam par ronaa bhi nahin rote, magar yah jaanate hue ve shapath grahan samaaroh ke samay zarur jataate hai ki shapath sanskrit main lee he
 When our colleague Ajay Singh went to the Sampurnanand Sanskrit College, the organization of all the important organs of the University was sitting there
 ajay singh kaa saamana ek parisar main, ek hi din main chaar dharne se hua
 It is indeed a matter of pride that one of the four pickets was about this matter, about which this series of prime time has been going on for several days
 adhyapakon kii kami va kakshaen na chalane se chaatro kaa bemiyadi dharna
 This slogan on the red banner won my heart
 pehali baar kahin to chaatr adhyapakon kii kami or kakshaen na chalane ke kilaaf bemiyadi dharne par baithe mili
 When the picket becomes indefinite, it should be taken serially
 chaatro ke haath main jo binar hai unke naare bataate hai ki chaatr bharat kii vyapak samasyaon se bhi jujh rahe hai jo unke vishvavidhyalay main chali ai he
 Liberation from brokers is India's eternal problem, the fighters of which have not yet been freed from this earth
 ye chaatr vanshavaad or kshetravaad jaisi mahamari kii samaapti kii bhi maang kar rahe hai
 Apart from appointing vacant posts, they are raising their banners demanding an investigation to spread anarchy
 chaatr shakti or raashtra shakti binar ke kone main likhaa he
 Hail to religion and destruction of unrighteousness
 chaatro main sadbhaavna ho or vishvavidhyalay kaa kalyaan ho
 Wishing welfare is an integral part of Sanskrit education
 chaatro ne apni loktantric shakti kaa istamaal kiya he, iske liye unhen badhai
 The problems of students are so different that different groups are also needed to raise them
 jise puri karne ke liye ek alag gut is tuuti hui sadak ke nirmaan kii maang kar rahaa he
 The road runs from the hostel to the central office of the university
 sadak kii haalat dekhakar dukhi hone kii zarurat nahin he, kyonki abhi aapako hastal kii haalat kaa bhi sadma bardaasht karnaa he
 a banner is demanding that road construction be done without delay
 vilamb jhelte jhelte hamaare chaatr avilamb ke sahare apane dhiraj kaa dilasa de rahe hai
 The hostels should be beautified and repaired with immediate effect
 bharat main prabhaav teen prakaar ke hote hai
 Effects, side effects and immediate effects
 ye chaatr chaatr sangh kaa chunaav bhi karaane kii maang kar rahe hai
 Two more dharnas are going on
 dharna pradarshan main agar aap nahin gaye, yaa nahin baithe to yakeen jaaniye aapane loktantric jivan to jiyaa hi nahin
 Employees' unions and professors are also sitting on the dharna here
 bharat kii sarkaar ko har saal demokrasi report jari kerani chahie jisamen bataaya jaae ki kis pradarshan ke baad karrwai hui, kis pradarshan kaa nateeja nahin niklaa or kis pradarshan kaa kabhi nateeja hi nahin nikalegaa
 Seeing the strike of the employees union and teachers also, Ajay Singh felt that even though the system has made this university sick, the effect of antibiotic of democracy is still remaining in the teachers here
 yahaan par chaatro kii tarah josh kam he, bujurg ho chuke hai or kaiyon ke paas kaala bag aa chukaa he
 When the black bag hangs on the shoulder, then the life of a government job has become successful
 umr ho gai he isliye bargad ke neeche aa gaye
 September salary is not received
 2010 se vidhyalay kaa grant nahin aayaa he
 Due to which no work is being done
 yahaan par har har mahadev kaa naaraa bhi lagata he
 Democratic struggles also get energy from Har Har Mahadev, but it is not that the slogan of Employee Unity Zindabad has disappeared
 sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay kaa yogadan itnaa hi he ki usee kaa lihaaz kar sarkaron ne jeevandaan diya hua he, varna to lagata he ki ise band karne main koi kasar nahin chodi gai hogi
 The primary hospital within the university is closed, and there are agitations to get it started
 ab ham chalenge chatravaas kii taraf
 We want you to keep quiet a bit and you cry peacefully through the photographs without shedding tears
 ronaa bhi kai prakaar kaa hota he
 It would be appropriate to cry without tears at this time
 tasveeron main aapako shauchalay dikhegaa magar svachh bharat nahin dikhegaa
 There is no need to panic because the students have found a corner for Paan Peak
 kaaman room kii haalat vahi he jo aapaki hamaari he
 Regardless of the crumbling roof of the common room, the students are watching the news channel, you will love seeing it
 ki ham kuch kar bhale na paae
 Looking at Propaganda
 ye sab dekhne sunne ke baad kya aap ab yah bhi jaananaa chahenge ki sampoornanand sanskrit mahavidhyalay main kitne shikshak hai, kitne nahin hai
 There are 24 departments, 5 faculty
 vishyon or vibhaagon ke naam hai vyakaran, jyotish, sahitya,puraana, mimasaa, veydant, tulanaatmak dharm darshan, buddha darshan, jain darshan or paali
 For proper study of all these
 118 adhyaaapak hone chahie, magar 46 hi hai, 72 nahin hai
 The advertisement for restoration has come out, but the selection process is disputed
 sampoornanand sanskrit mahavidhyalay se sambandhit yaa manyataprapt bharat kaa koun sa aisa ilaaka hoga jahaan koi vidhyalay yaa college nahin hoga
 550 schools are affiliated to it
 manyata dene ke niyam saadhaaran hai
 One and a half acres of land, five to seven rooms be a library, playground if you can open a Sanskrit institute
 yah sab to banaras ke sampoornanand sanskrit mahavidlaay main 1791 se he, magar uski haalat aapane abhi dekhi
 Our entire series is on ndtv's website and Facebook page
 aap dekhie or dikhaaiye ki bharat ke naujavaanon ko barbaad karne kaa rashtriya project kis tarah se chal rahaa he
 Here too, there are allegations of rigging in appointments
 sanskrit shiksha kaa ek or centre rahaa tha, hoga hi or hoga bhi
 
 
 Darbhanga of Bihar
 is imaarat kii kubsuurati par hi alag se prime time kar saktaa tha magar yah iske bheetar chalane vaali sanskrit shiksha ke saath ninsaphi ho jaaegi or sanskrit ke liye itani khubasurat imaarat daan main de dene vaale darbhanga ke maharaj kameshwar singh ke sapanom kii beqadri ho jaaegi
 Therefore, do not be fascinated by the idols of the building, keep your heart safe, it will be useful to rip Sanskrit
 darbhanga ke maharaj kameshwar singh ne praachya vidya ke vikaas ke liye apana lakshmishwar vilaas pales sahit 37 bigha zamin daan main de di
 Maharaj used to have a court in this building, he was also born here
 1961 main bihar ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri shrikrishna singh or tatkalin rajyapal zaaqir hossain ke vishesh prayaas bhi isaki sthapana main the
 The building has been given color due to the NAAC that went out to grading the universities of India like the horse of Ashwamedh Yagya
 tab jaakar bi grad praapt hua he, yahaan 70 fisadi se adhik shikshakon ke pad khaali hai
 62 colleges and 14 intermediate colleges run under it
 yahaan paali or praakrit kii padhai honi thi, magar band ho chuki he
 The manuscripts that are kept here are both rare and spectacular
 6000 pandulepiyaan hai
 Digitization has not taken place
 vaais chancelar kii anumati se dekh sakate hai
 There are millions of books here
 vishwa vidhyalay aniyamittaaon kaa bhandar he, isi par akhil bhartiya niabandh pratiyogita honi chahie jisamen maujuuda sarkaar ke kisi priy netaa kii jeevani inaam ke taur par di jaani chahie
 Do you think the Minister of Education will be working? haal philhal main shiksha mantriyon ke bayaan ko google kiijie
 You will get less on education, more on Netagiri
 sanskrit ko bachaane ke naam par mitaayaa ja rahaa he
 When Pramod Gupta went to another college, just a kilometer away from Kameshwar University, you could see what he saw
 sau tirth se zyaada punya kamaayenge
 Like Bhole Baba, drink a cup of poison

 However
 
 
 aap ab darbhanga ke mohalla haraahi pokhar pashchim sankat mochan dham aa gaye hai
 The name of this six-room college running along the road is Vidyanand Mithila Sanskrit College
 vidyanand ji ne is college ke liye zamin daan di thi baad main unke parivaar ke logon ne bhi iske kuch hisse par kabza kar liya
 Well done according to me
 baahar se college kii imaarat bataa rahi he ki sanskrit ke naam par loksabhaa main shapath lene se sanskrit kaa bhala nahin ho jaataa he
 When Pramod ji arrived, seeing the journalist, this student was called from somewhere and the class was started
 acchhee baat he ki is college main principal or shikshak milakar das log hai
 Pramod ji turned one page of the student attendance register, then no student was seen absent on any day
 bharat main atendence kii apni mahima he
 If you are not present, then no one can prove that you were not in this world
 1907 main yah college bana tha, imaarat to isaki thik lagati he
 Earlier it was named Maharani Adhirani Sanskrit College but now it has been renamed Rameshwar Lata Sanskrit Mahavidyaya

 The contribution of Sampoornanand Sanskrit University is so much that the governments have been given life in respect of the same, otherwise it seems that no effort will be left to shut it down
 uniwarsity ke bheetar kaa praathmik aspataal band he, jise chaalu karaane ke liye andolan chal rahe hai
 Now we will go towards the hostel
 ham chaahate hai ki thodi dur chup rahe or aap shanti se tasveeron ke zarie bina aansu bahaae rote rahe

 After listening to all these, would you also like to know how many teachers are there in Sampurnanand Sanskrit College and how many are not
 yahaan 24 vibhaag hai, 5 sankaay hai
 The names of subjects and departments are Grammar, Astrology, Literature, Purana, Mimamsa, Vedanta, Comparative Religion, Buddhism, Jainism and Pali
 in sab kii uchit padhai ke liye
 There should be 118 teachers, but 46 are there, 72 are not
 bahaali kaa vigyaapan niklaa he, magar chayan prakriya par vivaad he
 Which region of India belonging to or affiliated with Sampoornand Sanskrit College will have no school or college? 550 vidhyalay isse sambhddha hai
 The rules for recognition are simple
 dedh acre zamin ho, paanch saat kamare ho librari ho, khel kaa maidan ho to aap sanskrit santhaan khol sakate hai
 All this is in the Sampurnanand Sanskrit Mahavidlaya of Banaras since 1791, but you have just seen its condition
 hamaari yah puri series enditivi kii website or fasebuk pej par he
 You see and show how the national project of ruining the youth of India is going on
 yahaan bhi niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee ke aarope lag rahe hai
 Sanskrit was another center of education, it will happen and it will happen
 
 
 bihar kaa darbhanga
 The beauty of this building itself could have been primed separately but it would be unfair with the Sanskrit education going on within it and the dreams of Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga who donated such a beautiful building to Sanskrit would be lost
 isliye imaarat kii murtiyon jhaadphanus par mohit mat ho jaaiyegaa, apane kaleje ko bachaakar rakhie, badahaal sanskrit ke haal par chirane ke kaam aayega
 Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga donated 37 bighas of land including Lakshmishwar Vilas Palace for the development of oriental learning
 isi imaarat main maharaj kaa darbar laga karata tha, unka janm bhi yaheen hua tha
 Special efforts were also made in 1961 by the then Chief Minister of Bihar Shri Krishna Singh and the immediate Governor Zaqir Hussain
 ashwamegh yajna ke ghode kii tarah bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon kii grading karne nikle NAAC ke kaaran hi imaarat ko rang diya gaya he
 Since then, b grade has been attained, more than 70 percent of the teachers posts are vacant here
 62 college or 14 intermidiet college iske tahat chalate hai
 Pali and Prakrit were to be studied here, but have stopped
 yahaan jo pandulepiyaan rakhi hai wo durlabh bhi hai or shandaar bhi hai
 There are 6000 Pandulipis
 digitizeshan nahin hua he
 With the permission of the Vice Chancellor
 lakhon kitaaben hai yahaan
 The Vishwa Vidyalaya is a repository of irregularities, on which there should be an All India Essay Competition in which the biography of a dear leader of the current government should be given as a reward
 aapako lagata he ki shiksha mantri log kaam karte honge
 Recently google the education ministers statement
 aapako shiksha par kam, netagiri par zyaada milegaa
 Sanskrit is being erased in the name of saving
 pramod gupta jab kameshwar vishvavidhyalay se maatr ek kilometre dur ek or college gaye to jo dekha wo aap dekh lijie
 You will earn more than a hundred pilgrimages
 bhole baba kii tarah aap bhi vish kaa pyaalaa pi lijie

 You have now come to Darbhanga's Mohalla Harahi Pokhar West Sankat Mochan Dham
 sadak kinare chal rahaa chah kamaron ke is college kaa naam vidyanand mithila sanskrit mahavidhyalay
 Vidyanand ji donated land for this college, later his family members also captured some part of it
 mere hisaab se acha kiya
 The college building from outside is telling that taking oath in Lok Sabha in the name of Sanskrit does not benefit Sanskrit
 jab pramod ji pahunche to patrkaar ko aayaa dekh is chaatra ko kahin se bula laayaa gaya or class chaalu karaayaa gaya
 The good thing is that there are ten people in this college, including the principal and the teacher
 pramod ji ne chaatr upasthiti panjika kaa ek panna palata to koi chaatr kisi bhi din absent hi nahin dikhaa
 Attendance has its own glory in India
 aap ho na hon atendence lag jaae to koi sabit nahin kar saktaa he ki aap is duniya main hi nahin the
 This college was built in 1907, the building looks like it
 pehle iskaa naam maharani adhirani sanskrit mahavidhyalay tha magar ab ise rameshwar lata sanskrit mahavidhyay kar diya gaya he
 There are 7 teachers in the name of Shibhak while 10 should be there
 vyakaran sahitya, veda, jyotish, main koi praadhyaapak nahin he
 a teacher of ritual is also due to retire next month

 When Pramod ji arrived, seeing the journalist, this student was called from somewhere and the class was started

 Pramod ji turned one page of the student attendance register, then no student was seen absent on any day

 If you are not present, then no one can prove that you were not in this world

 Earlier it was named Maharani Adhirani Sanskrit College but now it has been renamed Rameshwar Lata Sanskrit Mahavidyaya 
 yahaan par shibhak ke naam par 7 teacher hai jabaki 10 hone chahie
 There is no professor in grammar literature, Vedas, astrology

 For which the Prime Minister is going to Patna
 hamane prime time kii series main bataaya tha ki patna universti kaa haal kitna bura ho gaya he
 There is nothing to celebrate but politics

 Shatrughan Sinha never skipped in praising Nitish Kumar, so Nitish Kumar should have called at least a university alumnus

 Our series on Sanskrit education is not yet complete

 If you are not bored, think of those students who went to the college without teachers for four years and did not get bored
 kya aapako lagata he ki aap ucch shiksha ko lekar sajag hone ja rahe hai, saadhaaran aamadani waalon ke liye ek baat bataanaa chahta hum
 Why this is happening, this is happening so that your children never get a good education

 Which region of India belonging to or affiliated with Sampoornand Sanskrit College will have no school or college? 550 vidhyalay isse sambhddha hai
 The rules for recognition are simple
 dedh acre zamin ho, paanch saat kamare ho librari ho, khel kaa maidan ho to aap sanskrit santhaan khol sakate hai
 All this is in the Sampurnanand Sanskrit Mahavidlaya of Banaras since 1791, but you have just seen its condition

 Sanskrit was another center of education, it will happen and it will happen
 
 
 bihar kaa darbhanga
 The beauty of this building itself could have been primed separately but it would be unfair with the Sanskrit education going on within it and the dreams of Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga who donated such a beautiful building to Sanskrit would be lost
 isliye imaarat kii murtiyon jhaadphanus par mohit mat ho jaaiyegaa, apane kaleje ko bachaakar rakhie, badahaal sanskrit ke haal par chirane ke kaam aayega
 Maharaj Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga donated 37 bighas of land including Lakshmishwar Vilas Palace for the development of oriental learning
 isi imaarat main maharaj kaa darbar laga karata tha, unka janm bhi yaheen hua tha
 Special efforts were also made in 1961 by the then Chief Minister of Bihar Shri Krishna Singh and the immediate Governor Zaqir Hussain
 ashwamegh yajna ke ghode kii tarah bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon kii grading karne nikle NAAC ke kaaran hi imaarat ko rang diya gaya he
 Since then, b grade has been attained, more than 70 percent of the teachers posts are vacant here
 62 college or 14 intermidiet college iske tahat chalate hai
 Pali and Prakrit were to be studied here, but have stopped

 Recently google the education ministers statement
 aapako shiksha par kam, netagiri par zyaada milegaa
 Sanskrit is being erased in the name of saving

 Rahul Gandhi wants to highlight the difference between Sanatan Dharma and hardline Hindutva by visiting religious places and regularly targeting Hinduism organizations
 isi ranneeti ke tahat vah sangh ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai

 He on Friday compared the RSS to the Sunni Islamic organization, the Muslim Brotherhood
 unhone kaha ki aresas bharat ke har santhaan par kabja karnaa chahta he or desh ke swaroop ko hi badalanaa chahta he

 There is no other organization in India that wants to capture the institutions of the country
 "congress adhyaksh ne kaha, "ham jisase jujh rahe hai vah ekadam nayaa vichaar he

 america tech company Google kii ek study se kuch hairaan kar dene vaali findings mili hai
 1 of the entire Internet
 5% sin in aise passwords se hote hai jo pehle se hi hack ho chuke hai
 Google has said, 'we have scanned 21 million usernames and passwords and 3 of them
 16 lakh se zyada ansef hai’ company ne kaha he ki data brich kii warning ke baad 26% yugers ne password badale hai
 94% of these new passwords are real-like strong
 lekin kuch yugers ne in warning ko ignor bhi kiya he
 In this study of Google, it has also been said that users should stop using one type of password for different websites
 aisi sthiti main aise yugers kii jaankariyaan chori hone ke khatre zyada rahete hai
 It is worth noting that due to the ease of users, many websites keep the same password
 jaise jimail, fasebuk yaa twitor in sab ke ek tarah ke password rakhte hai
 In such a situation, if the data is stolen from any one platform, then in this case, hackers target other accounts of the users with the same password
 har saal sabase kharaab password kii list jari hoti he jinamein number 1 par 12345678 hota he
 Similarly, weak passwords are created by different websites
 yugers ko katai bhi ek password alag alag plateform ke liye yuj nahin karnaa chahie
 Apart from this, it should be made stronger by using special character in password and it should be changed from time to time
 google kii is study se ek baat to saaf he ki baari maatra main yugers password se judi warning ko ignor kar dete hai or iskaa khamiyaja unhen kai tarah se bhugatna padataa he

 According to a senior police officer, after killing the wife, the accused dumped her body in the gutter
 ghatana kii jaankaree milane ke baad police ne aaropee pati ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Police have identified the deceased woman as Seema
 parijanon kaa aarope he ki aaropee pati ne apni patni kii hatya dahej ke liye kii he
 At the same time, an official said that the knife used in the incident on the spot of the accused has also been seized
 saath hi mahila ke shav kaa bhi postmortem karaane ke baad parivaar waalon ko saunp diya gaya he
 According to the officer, the accused had given information about his wife's murder by phone to his mother-in-law but his mother-in-law felt that his son-in-law was joking
 police kii shuruaati jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki pati-patni ke bich beete lambey samay se kai chizon ko lekar khinchataan bhi chal rahi thi
 The accused youth works in a private company
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle bhiprem nagar ilaake main ek shaks ne apni patni kii pathar se kuchal kar hatya karne ke baad uske shav ke kai tukade kiye or ghar ke septic tanks main daal diya tha
 After that the man himself reached the police station and confessed his crime
 aaropee ko apni patni ke charitra par shaq tha
 Ashu, who is under police custody, had confessed to the police when he reached the Prem Nagar police station on Sunday morning
 usne bataaya tha ki use apni patni ke charitra par shaq tha isliye usne apni patni seemaa kii pathar se kuchalakar hatya kar di or shav ke chaaku se kai tukade kar ghar ke septic tanks main daal diye the
 The police rushed to his house to retrieve the dead body of the border
 police ke mutabik ghar ke septic tanks kaa bahari hissaa bahut chota thaor shav ke kai tukade kiye theisaliye shav baraamad karne main abhi kaaphi samay lag jayega
 The house where the murder took place is Ashu's own house, while he lives on rent in another house with three children
 wo apni patni ko kisi bahaane se is ghar main laayaa tha
 She was married about 9 years ago
 seemaa ke bhaaiyon ke mutabik ashu ne hatya ke baad unhen bhi phone kar bataaya tha ki usne seemaa kii hatya kar di he, to unhen vishwaas nahin hua
 The police is now also investigating the role of Ashu's family members in this case, but this painful incident surprised the people of the entire area
 unhen vishwaas nahin ho rahaa ki ashu apni patni kii itani berahami se hatya kar shav ke tukade tukade kar degaa

 jang or kejariwal ke bich chal rahi jang ke bich mangalvaar subah ek nayaa mode aayaa jab dilli ke hauz khaas thane ke SHO ne kejariwal ke mantri jitendra singh tomars ko giraftaar kar liya
 He is accused of having a fake degree of advocacy
 vaise ye pehali baar nahin jab kejariwal ke kanoon mantri vivaadon main ho
 Somnath Bharti, who was the Law Minister in Kejriwal's first cabinet, had been in frequent disputes for making raid in the window extension at midnight and sometimes giving controversial statements on Arun Jaitley
 aaiye jaanate he mantri jitendra singh tomars ke bare main
 
 
 
 chunaav ayog ko diye gayi affidavit ke anusaar jitendra singh tomars 48 saal ke he or je je colony dilli ke nivasee he
 His declared wealth is also more than one crore
 inke paas do kaaren bhi he saath hi saath affidavit main nau bank acount kaa bebaak ullekh he
 He has been with the Congress party before but lost the first election in 2013 from Trinagar Assembly Constituency in Delhi on Aam Aadmi Party ticket
 uske baad is saal hue dilli chunaav main wo trinagar se hi chunaav jite or kejariwal sarkaar main kanoon mantri bane
 But he has also been given the responsibility of tourism, art and culture of Delhi
 ab baat mantri ke degree kii:jitendrane affidavit main ajukeshan vaale kollam main sirf 'tilak maanjhi, bhagalpur uniwarsity, bihar' hi likh rakhaa he
 And the whole controversy is about his LLB degree
 april main ek aar tii ai ke hawaale se pataa chalaa kii unki degree bogus he
 Just a day later, the Bhagalpur University told the Delhi High Court that the registration number which is on their degree is registered on that number
 degree puri tarah se galat or bogus he
 The case against him seems to get stronger when he makes a statement to an English newspaper that he has a valid degree of advocacy from Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut
 jab mantri ke paas choudhary charan singh uniwarsity kii vaid degree thi to affidavit main bhagalpur uniwarsity likhane kii kya zarurat thi?baat yaheen khatm hoti to behatar hota
 The minister also has a Bachelor of Science degree from Kantaprasad Sundarlal Saket PG College, Ayodhya, Awadh University
 santhaan kaa kahana he mantri kii second year kii marksheet galat he
 The Controller of Examinations of Awadh University, AM Ansari, told an English newspaper that the minister's mark sheet had many flaws
 puraa maamla jalebi kii tarah ulajhaa hua he
 KK Menon, chief of the Delhi Bar Council, is also confused about the degree of minister
 vaise mantri ji ke khilaaf IPC kii kai dhaaraon ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya ja chukaa he jo kuch aise he:420 (dhokhadhadi), 467 (jaalsaji), 468 (jaalsaji dhokhadhadi ke liye), 120 b (aapraadhik sajeesh) khayr maamla court main he vahi bataa paangi kii sach kya he? Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit has again indicated an increase in electricity rates
 iske saath unhone kaha he ki jo bijli companiyaan behatar suvidhaayen muhaiyaa nahin karaati unka license cancil karne ke vikalp bhi khule hai
 Sheila Dixit said that the management of a power company has been given a clear warning about the cuts that their services are very bad
 bijli companiyon ke saath ek meeting main shila dikshit ne bijli companiyon ko rajdhani ke kai ilaakon main katautee ke samay kii suchi saunpi
 He said that the technical defects which are being cut should be removed immediately
 is bich, rajdhani main yojit ek program main shila dikshit ne kaha ki bijli sankat ko dur karne ke liye bavana plant taiyaar kiya gaya tha lekin gas kii kami hone se 1500 megawatt kaa ye plant kargar sabit nahin ho rahaa he
 According to him, the Bmanauli plant could not be started because of the gas has become very expensive
 siem ne kaha ki haryana kii madad se jhajjar main 700 megawatt ke koyale par aadhaarit plant se bijli lene kaa intjaam kiya gaya tha lekin utpaadan kaa kharch bad jane se ye kaaphi mahangaa padegaa
 He said that electricity rates in UP have become 50 percent costlier
 iske baavjood media main is khabar kii charchaa nahin hui lekin dilli main bijli kii daren thodi hi badhane par ho-hallaa shuru ho jaataa he
 Significantly, Delhi Chief Minister Shila Dixit made a strange statement on the skyrocketing electricity bill a few days ago
 shila dikshitne kaha tha ki ki agar kisi parivaar ko aisa lagata he ki bijli kaa bill meri aamadani se baahar he or main ye nahin chukaa saktaa to bhaiyya do kii jagah ek balb jala lo, cooler naa chalaao, pankhaa naa chalaao, refricrator naa chalaao yaa kabhi use band kar do
 He said that do not play TV 24 hours, play it occasionally
 washing mashin bhi he to usko bhi mat chalaao
 Christmas Day is celebrated every year on 25 December as the birthday of Christ
 isai samudaay ke log isa messiah ko ishwar kaa betaa maanate hai
 It is the biggest festival for the people of Christianity
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki kai deshon main christmas kaa tyohaar alag-alag din manaaya jaataa he
 Yes, Christmas is celebrated on 25 December in some countries, while some Orthodox countries celebrate Christmas on 7 January
 aaie jaanate hai kyon
 
 
 Actually, this is due to the difference between the Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar
 pashchim ke log gregorian calendar ko follow karte hai
 This calendar was started by Pope Gregory in 1582
 lekin, kuch madhya purv ke log abhi bhi julian calendar ko follow karte hai
 This calendar was started by Julius Caesar in 45 BC
 bataa den, julian calendar gregorian calendar se pehle follow kiya jaataa tha
 According to this calendar, Christmas Day is celebrated on 7 January, which is called Old Christmas Day
 saal 1752 menenglandne julian calendar kii jagah gregoriancalendarfolo karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 But many people did not listen to the new calendar and they followed their old Julian calendar
 donon calendar main 13 din kaa fark he
 Accordingly, people who follow different calendars celebrate Christmas Day on different days

 lekin kuch roodhiwaadee desh (orthodox Countries) jaise greece, romania ne san 1923 se 25 disambar ko christmas kaa tyohaar manaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 However, in countries like Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Egypt and Bulgaria, Christmas festival is celebrated only in the month of January
 iske alaava srbija, belarus, montenegro, kazakhstan, macedonia, ithiopia, jeeorgia aadi deshon main bhi 7 janvari ko christmas kaa tyohaar manaaya jaataa he

 There is a tussle between Chief Minister's nephew Akhilesh Yadav and Chacha Shivpal
 aise main pratyaashiyon ke naamon ke elaan ko bhi lekar bhi party main uthalputhal hona lajimi he
 Let me tell you that while trying for reconciliation on behalf of SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, Akhilesh had bowed down but he made it clear that he will play a big role in the distribution of tickets in the coming elections

 uphaar haadasa maamle main 13 aktubar ko supreme court kaa faisla, jisamen peediton kaa muaavja kam kar diya gaya, sunaae jane ke baad agali subah lodhi garden main talahate samay arun jetali ne mujhe roka
 He said, "there is no sense of giving justice in this decision
 
 
 jis maamle ne puure desh ke saath-saath adaalat kii antaratma ko jhanser ko rakh diya ho, usamen muaavja kam karne kii kahaan jarurat thi
 "the reality is: the judicial pendulum can go from one end to the other
 november, 2009 main is maamle main faisla surakshit rakhe jane ke ek saal pehle, ek aaropee ne is aadhaar par jamaanat kii arji di thi ki jab maalikon ko hycourt se jamaanat mil chuki he, to use bhi jamaanat milani chahie
 The Supreme Court had then shown considerable resentment, as the owners were facing another case of tampering with documents
 usne turant jamaanat radd karne kaa notice jari kiya or unhen waapas jail bhej diya
 Thus the extent of resentment, or lack thereof, generally depends on the bench of judges
 ab jaraa dekhie ki yah pendulum muaavje ke maamle main kis tarah jhulata rahaa he
 In the case of a gift accident, the High Court in 2003 paid Rs 18 lakh to a close relative of every victim above the age of 20 years
 or 20 saal se kam umr vaale peedit ke kareebi rishtedaar ko 10 lakh ru
 Was ruled to be compensated
 supreme court ne apane taaja faisle main 20 saal se upar kii umr vaale peedit ke muaavje kii rakam ghataakar 10 lakh ru
 And 7 for reducing the compensation amount for a victim under 20 years
 5 lakh ru

 ek maamla sirf 15 second kii galati kaa he or doosraa 59 logon kii maut kaa
 In one, there is the matter of being negligent and in the other the death of people due to the greed of some traders
 ek main maafee mangakar galati sudhari ja sakati he
 But no one can bring back the lives of those killed in another
 ek main kuch der ke liye pratishtha ko kshati pahunchane kaa maamla he, to doosraa jan kanoon ke prati javabdehi se judaa he
 In one, the verdict came in less than three years, the second was delayed by 15 years, and when the verdict finally came, it is possible that some of the victims' relatives may have to return some of their compensation earlier
 samvidhan main fatafat nyaay paanaa logon kaa adhikaar he
 But the Supreme Court was delayed for more than seven years, taking two years to pronounce it after securing the verdict
 supreme court ne muaavje kii rakam kam kar die jane kii vajah yah bataai he ki hycourt ne 26 june, 1983 ko cinema haul kaa license chaar din ke liye nilambit karne par die gaye sthagan ko nirast nahin kiya tha, or july, 1989 main jab usee cinema haul main aag lagane kii ek or ghatana hui to license jari karne vaale vibhaag ne sthagan ko radd karne kii maang kii, lekin sthagan radd karne ke bajaae usne licencing ke disipi ko haul kii jaanch karne kaa aadesh diya
 The anguish of close relatives of those who died in the accident is that their own loved ones, who had gone to see the film in the 'licensed' cinema hall, met them in the form of corpses
 har koi jaanata he ki jahrili gas se hone vaali maut kitni takalifdeh hoti he
 Most were evacuated from the balcony or downstairs hall of the cinema hall in an unconscious or dead state
 inke nikaas dwaar ko maalik ke dekhne ke liye banaae gaye vishesh box kii vajah se band kar diya gaya tha
 The (unlawful) permission for such a box was taken from the DCP of the licensing department
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki purab kii ore seedhiyaan bhi band ho gai thim
 For those who lost their loved ones, it makes no sense, whether A, B, c is responsible for it
 13 saal tak jan suraksha niyam or prakriya kaa ulanghan, jisamen janata ke paise se vetan paane vaale adhikariyon kii bhi santhganth he, saaf dikhaai detaa he
 The Supreme Court has not raised any issue on them
 bahut pehle 1983 main supreme court ne kaha tha ki misaal kaayam karne vaala muaavja kanoon kii shakti ko jaij tehraane kaa jaruri uddeshy puraa kar saktaa he
 If the court does not give such compensation, then it is just to show sympathy to the fundamental rights which give the right to life and liberty
 is ulanghan ko rokane kaa tarika yah he ki misaal banane vaala aarthik jurmaana lagaaya jaae
 In 1983, Justice Chandrachud said, "if civilization is not to be destroyed in this country, as it has been destroyed in other countries, then the government must compensate for the loss

 But what are the four districts that are completely free from open defecation? iskaa koi record gramin or panchayat vibhaag ke paas nahin he
 The debt taken to build toilets is that in hundreds of villages of Chhattisgarh, these days, government officials are putting pressure on villagers to build toilets in their homes
 unhen sarkari yojana ke tahat aarthik sahaayta sweekrut karne kaa aashwaasan bhi diya ja rahaa he
 But it is being said that this amount will be given to them when they become toilets and they start using it

 Villagers have to visit government offices for financial assistance
 maheenon baad bhi unhen sarkari sahaayta nahin mil paa rahi he
 For the rural ODF, who are unable to repay the loan, the government has sanctioned an amount of 12 thousand to the villagers who build toilets in their homes
 lekin yah rakam paane ke liye graminon kaa dam nikal rahaa hai
 Due to non-receipt of government money on time, they have to pay cash to the contractors who build the toilet by borrowing

 Many villagers have sold their land to repay the loan
 rajya ke 27 jilon main se aisa koi bhi jila nahin he jahaan graminon ko puri tarah se toilet banane kii rakam de di gai he
 Most of the villagers are seen complaining about non-payment as soon as they knock in the village

 While 1126 villages are on the verge of becoming open defecation free
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki 31 march se pehle ye sabhi gaanv apana target puraa kar lenge
 There is a competition among the district collectors that more and more villages in their districts should be declared as ODF
 iske liye sarkari mashinari ko puri tarah se jhonk diya gaya he
 Duties of officers from village panchayats to urban bodies have been imposed
 iske alaava tehseeldaar, sab diviginal magistrest or atirikt colectoron ko kaamon kii dekharekh kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he

 is dauraan goa ke donon sansadeey kshetron main telephone intervyuu liye gaye
 354 participants took part in it
 kashmir se dhara 370 hataane ke mudde par trinmul congress (tiemasi) ke virodh ko lekar party pramukh or pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne rukh saaf kiya he
 Mamta says that her opposition is 'procedural' and is not linked to the merits of this step
 mangalvaar ko chennai ke liye ravaanaa hone se pehle mamata ne kaha, “main prakriyaagat tareeke se sahamat nahin hum
 i am not talking about the merits of the bill concerned
 lekin jis tarah kii prakriya apanaai gai, us par meri party ne jo stand liya he wo majboot he
 We cannot support nor vote for this bill
 aisa karne se record hoga ki pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh taur par hamane bill ko sweekaar kar liya
 i am not talking about merit
 ham prakriyaagat khaamiyon ke puri tarah khilaaf hai
 "LIVE: Home Minister said in Lok Sabha - Cannot bring Farooq Abdullah out of the gun on the temple, while expressing the need for consensus among political parties on issues of national interest," Mamata said, "this message should go all over the country that we can reach our motherland and from it Love things connected
 ham saath khadey hai
 We want a peaceful dialogue and a solution
 aise main koi raajnneetik shorgul yaa pradooshan nahin hona chahie
 The TMC chief further said, "it is neither praiseworthy nor democratic either constitutionally and legally
 unhen sabhi raajnneetik dalon ke saath is par vimarsh karnaa chahie tha
 Should have also talked to the local people of Kashmir
 unhen kashmir main baithak bulani chahie thi, ham vahaan jane ko taiyaar the
 "mamta told the people of Kashmir the need to be taken into confidence
" mamata ne kaha, “desh ke naagarik hone kii vajah se ham sabhi deshbhakt log hai or apni mathrubhumi se pyaar karte hai
 i firmly believe that Kashmiri people are our brothers and sisters
 main sarkaar se aagrah or apil karti hum ki unhen apane ko alag-thalag mahasoos nahin hone diya jaae
 They should feel that they are with the country and are Indians
 hamen logon main vishwaas kaayam karnaa chahie ki koi bhi bhaybheet mahasoos naa kare
 Mamta demanded the immediate release of two former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir - Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah
 mamata ne kaha, ‘ham sab saath hai
 i think Mehbooba, Omar and other political figures are not terrorists, they should be released in the interest of democratic institutions and people
 ’ After the terrorist attack in Uri, the pressure on the central government to take revenge from Pakistan has increased
 pakistan kii uksaane vaali karrwai kaa jawaab dene ke liye bharat ke paas tareeke bhi hai
 But before attacking the neighboring country, all aspects have to be considered
 india tudeke 5 oktober, 2016 ank main is masale par vistaar se prakaash daalaa gaya he
 In this hour of crisis, PM Narendra Modi has decided how to avenge Pakistan's martyrdom of 19 soldiers whose terrorists on the ground cross the border and spread terror
 aise main bharat ke paas pakistan ko sabak sikhaane ke liye ye hai vikalp:1
 COVERT OPERATION: The target of this operation is parzash-e-muhammadka Chief Maulana Masood Azhar who is the mastermind of the attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001 and the Pathankot airbase in 2016
 bhartiya khufia agenciyon ko khabar mili he ki ajahar ek sabha main hissaa lene bahawalpur se karachi jane vaala he
 RAW officers can go to Afghanistan border and prepare for attack on Jaish chief there
 is oparation ko anjaam dene ke liye baluchi algaavvaadiyon kii madad lee ja sakati he
 2
 sargical strikabharat ke paas vikalp he ki aatank ke aakaaon ko maar giraane ke liye sargical hamale kiye jaaen
 The same attack was done by the US in Abbottabad, Pakistan to kill Osama bin Laden
 pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir (pioke) main lashkar-e-taiyaba or jaish-e-mohammad ke training camp hai
 Such attacks can be carried out to destroy them
 3
 Intersecting into the border, the Indian Army can identify the posts of the Pakistani Army adjacent to the outskirts from where terrorists are sent to infiltrate into India
 aise menindian armijang ke sajo-saamaan se las hokar un chaukiyon par baari golabari kar sakati he
 Army commandos can put raids on these posts
 4
 Trade war can also knock Pakistan out on the trade front
 2012 main pakistan ko diya gaya most faverd nesan kaa darja waapas le saktaa he
 4 via India and Pakistan via Dubai
 71 arab dollar ke vyapaar par roak lagaai ja sakati he
 Tax can be increased on Pakistani goods imported to India
 5
 On the diplomacy front, India should give shelter to the separatist leaders of Balochistan in India
 nai dilli main balooch mishan sthapit kiya janaa chahie
 Pakistan should be tried to surround Pakistan on the international stage
 saarc par bimstek (BIMSTEC) jaise guton ko tarjeeh di jaani chahie, jinkapakistansadasy nahin he
 6
 homeland security ko majboot karnapakistan ko ghutanon par laane ke liye sabase jaruri he ki ham apni aantarik suraksha ko or majboot banaaen
 Be it Uri attack or Pathankot attack, our weakness has come to the fore on internal security
 in ghatnaon se saaf ho gaya ki ham apane sainya thikaanon kii suraksha karne main naakaam rahe hai
 If India responds sternly, then terrorists can retaliate to security targets in return, so we need to strengthen our surveillance and intelligence

 Sadhana Gupta, the second wife of Mulayam Singh Yadav, always considered to be the real reason for the quarrel in Samajwadi Party, has broken his silence
 unhone saaf kaha ki vah raajnneeti main aana chaahati thim, lekin netaji yani mulaayam singh yadav ne unhen manaa kar diya
 Now she will come forward in social work
 isse pehle bhi vah parde ke peeche party ke liye kaam karti rahi hai, lekin ab vakt aa gaya he ki saamne aaen
 Sadhna Gupta, the step mother of UP CM Akhilesh Yadav, was even referred to as Kaikeyi in socialist fights
 lekin unhone hameshaa khud ko is maamle se alag bataaya
 She repeatedly said that she considers Akhilesh Yadav her elder son
 hameshaa usase baat karti hai
 But someone has misled Akhilesh Yadav
 vah chaahati hai ki unka doosraa betaa pratik yadav bhi akhilesh kii tarah raajnneeti main aae
 Sadhna Gupta is a resident of Bidhuna Tehsil in Etawah, UP
 4 july 1986 main unki shaadi farrukhabad ke chandraprakash gupta se shaadi hui thi
 Prateek Yadav was born on 7 July 1987 after their marriage
 iske do saal baad sadhana or chandraprakash alag ho gaye the
 After this, Sadhna Gupta came in contact with Mulayam Singh Yadav, the then SP supremo
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki donon kaaphi dinon tak ek-duusare se milte-julate rahe
 Mulayam's mother Akhilesh Yadav's biography, often used to be ill, mentions Mulayam and Sadhana's relationship in the 'wave of change'
 ek news website ke mutabik, mulaayam kii maa murti devi aksar biimaar rahati thim
 Sadhna Gupta took care of Murthy Devi while undergoing treatment at a nursing home in Lucknow and later Saifai Medical College
 ek baar medical college main ek nurse murti devi ko galat injection lagane ja rahi thi
 Sadhana, who was present at that time, stopped the nurse
 sadhana ne aise jeeta mulaayam kaa dilaus vakt sadhana kii vajah se mulaayam kii maa murti devi kii jaan bachi gai thi
 Mulayam was quite impressed by this
 yahi se donon ek-duusare ke najadik aae the
 It is said that in 1994, in the school form of Prateek Yadav, MS Yadav was given in the name of father and instead of address, the office address of Mulayam Singh Yadav was given
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki saal 2000 main pratik ke abhibhavak ke rup main mulaayam kaa naam darj hua tha
 In 2003, Sadhna got a wife's entry, Mulayam Devi, Mulayam's first wife died
 23 may 2003 ko mulaayam ne sadhana ko apni patni kaa darja diya tha
 Sadhna's first husband's brother Pramod Gupta has been an MLA from SP
 sadhana kii choti bahan kalpana kii shaadi unase hui thi
 Kalpana also contested the Municipal Corporation
 is chunaav main akhilesh ne pramod gupta kaa tikat kaat diya tha, lekin pita ke dabaav main aakar phir se tikat de diya
 Son Prateek Yadav is bodybuilder, Gupta's son Prateek Gupta Yadav is currently away from politics
 ab sadhana chaahati hai ki vah bhi raajnneeti main aaen
 Prateek currently runs a high profile gym in Lucknow along with bodybuilding
 patni aparnaa yadav ke saath jaanwaron ke adhikaron ke liye bhi kaam karte hai
 At the age of 23, Prateek Yadav married Aparna Bisht after love's agreement

 On the Rs 104 crore found in the bsp's account in the ED raid, Union Minister of State for Finance Arjun Meghwal said that when it was announced on November 8, the government and the RBI had set the system, if no one will run according to that rule
 Action will be taken on phir chaahe koi party ho yaa phir koi bada aadmi isamen kisi ko koi chhot nahin milegi
 Regarding the meeting of pm's economists, Meghwal said that there are frequent meetings in the Finance Ministry, in which there has also been talk on pre-budget planning along with note
 piem modi or arun jetali bhi lagaataar baithken kar rahe he, desh kii kya aarthik dasha honi chahie us par lagaataar charchaa ho rahi he
 Arjun Meghwal said that in discussions with economists, GDP, digital payment and its infrastructure are being discussed
 vipaksh kii notebandi par baithak par meghavaal bole ki vipaksh pichley sheetakaaleen satr main hi bikhar gaya tha, us samay vah bharat band kii baaten kar rahe the
 Everyone was talking differently, so Rahul Gandhi went to meet the Prime Minister alone
 meghavaal ne kaha ki notebandi ke mudde par janata piem modi ke saath he, sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko bhi yah samaj aa rahaa he ki agar vah virodh karenge to janata naaraaz hogi isliye vipaksh main bikharaav aa gaya he
 Arjun Meghwal said that in the matter of Koman, the PM has spoken on the benami property in his mind, it is a serious matter, its goal is to hurt black money and stop black marketing
 bajet pesh hone se ek hafte pehle sarkaar ne choti bachat yojanaon par byaaj dar main 10 aadhaar ank kii katautee kii he
 That is, interest on various small savings schemes including Public Provident Fund, Kisan Vikas Patra, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, fixed deposits in the post office will be reduced during the July to September quarter
 sarkaar har timahi choti bachat yojanaon par milane vaale ritern kii samiksha karti he
 The main reason behind this cut in interest rates is the pressure on banks to make loans cheaper
 rigerv bank kii ore se nitigat daron main teen katautiyon ke baad bhi bank karj kii dar main badi katautee nahin kar paae
 The reason for this is the distressed balance sheet due to subordinated debt of banks
 arthvyavastha main gaharaati mandi ke marz ko dur karne kaa iklauta vikalp sarkaar ko khapat badhanaa najar aa rahaa he
 Consumption may increase when debt is cheaper
 bainkon ke paas karj dene ke liye fund jutaney kaa sabase bada strot aam janata kii bachat he
 After lowering the interest rate on small savings schemes, banks will also be able to reduce the interest rates on their fixed deposits
 masalan, 1 saal se lekar teen yaa paanch saal tak kii epady
 This will reduce the cost of funds for banks and will also open the way to reduce the lending rate
 lekin yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki aise samay main jab bachat do dashak ke nichle str par he sarkaar kii ore se bachat par ritern kii dar ghataane kaa kadam kitna kargar sabit hoga
 This move of the government will discourage people from various options of savings
 arthvyavastha ke maujuuda halaat main karj lene waalon kii sankhya main kitni badhotaree hoti he yah dekhne vaali baat hogi
 Yes, it is certain that this move of the government is sure to be scissored at the general public's savings

 Wherever the Lokayukta took action, information of his allegedly illegal property ranged from crores to billions of rupees
 khud naavlekar kaa daawa he ki unke jimmedaari sanbhaalane ke baad se ab tak 300 karod ru
 The alleged illegal assets of more than Rs
 jaahir he, unki sakriyata se bhrashtachari baabuon ke hosh phakhta hai
 After all, how is this important institution working? How does the information of corrupt people reach it? Knowing this is also no less interesting
 iskaa namoona kuril ke maamle main dekhne ko miltaa he
 The Lokayukta had given all the information about Kuril to none other than his brother-in-law Anil Arya
 bataaya jaataa he ki kuril ne apane saale kii naukari kisi company main lagavai thi, lekin baad main donon ke bich anban hone par anil ko naukari se hataa diya gaya

 isse hamen aropiyon kii jaankaree milti he or ham chapa maarthe hai’’ lokayukta karyaalay main pahunchane vaale zyaadaatar maamle aise hi aate hai
 In some cases, outsiders complain to the Lokayukta after getting information
 ek jaanch adhikari kehete hai ki jaankaree to unke paas chalakar aati he
 Usually, the complainant also gives evidence against the corrupt
 rajya lokayukta ne pichley kuch varshon main pradesh main padasth adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ke khilaaf kai badi karvaiyaan kii hai
 There have been some cases in which the Lokayukta police received billions from the officer's house

 "after receiving a complaint about a person, when the Lokayukta Sahib asks us for an inquiry, we secretly gather all the information about the accused," says an inspector who has participated in many of the Lokayukta raids
 
 yah baat ham kisi ko bhi pataa nahin lagane dete ki ham us vyakti ke bare main kya kar rahe hai
 "they say that many times the complainant gives information and proof of the property
" agar vah saboot nahin de paata he to hamen sabhi kagajaat jutaney padate hai taaki court main jaruri dastavejon ko saboot ke taur par pesh kiya ja sake
 The Lokayukta organization takes action in two cases: first is the case of misuse of office or corruption

 The officer of the inspector level then collects the property information from his level

" kisi vyakti ke khilaaf karrwai us vakt kii jaati he, jab hamen uske khilaaf karrwai karne ke paryaapt saboot mil jate hai
 "in the Lokayukta Institute, the Lokayuktas are the most important, but every employee is important, everyone's work is divided and everyone performs their job perfectly," says a department official
 kisi ek vyakti kii galati se puri karrwai bighad sakati he
 Therefore, when the raid is successful, every person in the organization has an equal contribution

 Ashok Awasthi says, "from 1 January 2014 till now, the Lokayukta police have estimated an estimated Rs 50-60 crore in 15 cases

 When action is taken against anyone, it is done under the Lokayukta Act
 khaas baat yah he ki sanghathan jo karrwai karata he, usamen se 65 fisadi maamalon main abhiyojan hota he
 "it is also true that the speed with which the Lokayukta police are taking action against corrupt officials is not seen against politicians accused of corruption
 lekin avasthi kisi bhi tarah ke dabaav se inkaar karte hai
 He says, "lokayukta Institute has never come under anyone's pressure
