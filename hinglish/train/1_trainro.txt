 Former mlas of the ruling party of Bihar were badly trapped when they had to walk on the muddy path under public pressure

 Due to public pressure, they had to forcibly walk on the muddy path because hundreds of people have been walking on this path for years

 It is often seen in Bollywood that superstar films are released on any festival or big occasions

 superstar salmaan khan ne bhi iskaa khyaal rakhte hue is saal kii id ke saath-saath or aane vaale agle do saalon kii id par apni filmein relies karne kaa faisla kiya he
 It is reported that in the year 2017 also a Salman Khan film Dabangg 3 will be released on Eid
 arbaj khan ke production mensalmaan khanki film 'dabang 3' 2017 main id par relies kii jaaegi
 Although the shooting of the film has not started yet, the shooting is reported to start in the middle of next year
 'dabang 3' main bhichulbul pandelag-alag buraaiyon ko mitaane kii koshish karte najar aaenge
 Significantly, this year, Salman Khan's 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' and 'sultan' are going to be released in 2016 next year
 maharashtra main naa-naa karte phir ek baar bhaajapa or shivasena gathbandhan kar baithe hai
 The announcement of both parties on 18 February is not limited to the Lok Sabha elections 2019, but this alliance will also be for the Maharashtra assembly elections to be held later this year
 gauratlab he ki maharashtra main bhaajapa or shivasena kaa gathbandhan 1989 ke loksabhaa chunaav se hi he or tab se lekar 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav tak donon partiyaan rajya main har loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav saath ladiin lekin 2014 ke maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main donon alag-alag chunaav lade the
 After all, what was the reason that the two fought separate elections in the assembly and now once again in the 2019 elections in the alliance? Another big question is that in recent times, how did the Shiv Sena suddenly agree to an alliance with the BJP, as was being shown on behalf of Shiv Sena? Was there a compulsion of both BJP and Shiv Sena alliance? The answer to these questions is hidden in the mathematics of their old alliance
 maharashtra kii 48 loksabhaa siton main se 25 par bhaajapa or baaki 23 par shivasena chunaav ladegi
 While Ramdas Athawale's RPI (A) was also given a seat in 2014, he has not got a seat in the NDA alliance this time
 badi baat ye he ki shivasena ko mili 23 siten usko ab tak mili siton ke hisaab se sabase adhik hai
 Three seats more than the last Lok Sabha election and one seat more than any Lok Sabha election
 chart 1: maharashtra main vibhinn loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa or shivasena dwaara ladi gai siton kii sankhyis chart se ye jaahir hota he ki bhaajapa shivasena kii tulana main hameshaa se adhik siton par chunaav ladati rahi he lekin ye baat vidhansabha chunaav main thik vipareet hoti he, jahaan 1990 se hi shivasena, bhaajapa ke muqaabale zyada siton par chunaav ladati aa rahi he
 Chart-2: Seats contested by BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra Assembly Elections The basic mantra of long-standing alliance of BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra was that in Lok Sabha elections, BJP will remain the elder brother in the alliance and Shiv Sena will play this role in the assembly elections
 lekin ye silsilaa 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main tut gaya
 The major reason for this breakdown was that under the leadership of Amit Shah, the BJP also wanted the role of the elder brother of the alliance in the Maharashtra assembly elections
 uskaa paimaana bhaajapa 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav parinaam ko bananaa chaahati thi jise shivasena ne thukraa diya tha kyonki use gathbandhan kaa purana formula hi manjuur tha
 However, both the parties fought separate elections in the assembly and the BJP emerged as a big party but could not touch the majority figure alone
 aisa kyon hua ki us samay kii taaja modi lahar ke baavjood bhaajapa rajya main bahumat ko nahin chhu pai or ek baar phir se shivasena ke saath gathbandhan ko taiyaar ho gai?darasal bhaajapa or shivasena kaa gathbandhan rajya main unki majaburi he
 For a long time, due to the simultaneous elections, not only the number of seats between them was almost fixed (except for a few) but also which seat goes to the account of which party was almost fixed
 is vajah se donon party ke kaaryakarta or sanghathan apane-apane vidhansabha or loksabhaa kshetra main majboot rahe lekin un kshetron main janaadhar ghatata gaya jahaan sahyogi party ke ummidavaar chunaav maidan main hote he
 For example, if we look at the results of the 2014 assembly elections in the state, in the Lok Sabha constituency where BJP candidates were contesting, BJP won 81 seats with 35 percent votes on 149 of the 163 seats but in those 119 seats Where the Shiv Sena used to contest, BJP contested 111 of them and won only 41 seats
 in ilaakon main uskaa vot bhi sirf 26 pratishat rahaa
 The same situation was also with Shiv Sena
 jin loksabhaa siton par shivasena chunaav ladati he uske tahat aane vaale vidhansabha siton par shivasena ko 26 pratishat vot mili jabaki anya siton par unka vot 10 pratishat kam rahaa
 The 2014 assembly election result was like a mirror for the BJP and Shiv Sena, both parties have seen their own picture in that mirror
 2019 kii ladaai main unke saamne congress or ensipi gathbandhan he
 The BJP could not afford to fight alone against them and as a result they had to give more seats to Shiv Sena than last year and possibly both had to return to their old formula of alliance

 He said that the Bihar cabinet will expand next month, but before that, JDU cadres will be given a place in the commission, board and corporation
 bataa den ki ayog, board or nigamon ke pad pichley kai saalon se khaali hai
 In this meeting held at Chief Minister's residence, CM said that JDU workers-leaders will be given proper place after Dussehra
 unhone kaha ki prakhand se lekar jila or rajya str par 20 sutreey kamity kaa gathan hoga
 JDU and BJP workers will be placed on the committee in proportion to the assembly seats
 20 sutri kamity yani kaarykram karyanvayan kamitiyon main shaamil sabhi netaaon ko sarkaar kii ore se suvidhaayen di jaaengi
 After the formation of the 20-point committee, the phase of filling the vacant posts in the Commission and the board-corporation will begin
 unhone kaha ki yahaan bhi jediu or bijepi ke bich vidhayakon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par pad baante jaaenge
 Nitish Kumar has also announced the expansion of the cabinet keeping the Lok Sabha elections in mind
 bataa den ki jediu cote ke mantriyon ke kai pad khaali pade hai, lekin nitish kumaar kuch puraane mantriyon ko hataa bhi sakate hai
 Allegedly 10 times in 10 years, Nitish Kumar knows that there is great disappointment among his party workers
 ab kursi kii aas main kaaryakartaaon main josh jagega
 However, the CM of Bihar has announced 10 times in the last 10 years regarding the formation of 20-point committee
 lekin aaj tak iskaa gathan nahin hua
 It will be important to see what happens this time

 apni shero-shaayari ke liye medical kii practice bich main hi chhod di
 He started to get in touch with famous poet Jigar Muradabadi and says that in 1945 when Majrooh Sultanpuri came to Mumbai for the first time to participate in a Mushaira run by Sabbo Siddhaki Institute, famous producer AR Kardar listened to his poetry and asked him to write lyrics for his film
 Of
 majaruuh sultanpuri ne kardaar sahab kii is peshkash ko thukraa diya kyonki vah kisi shaayar ke liye filmon ke liye geet likhane ko tauheen samajhate the ve acchhee baat nahin samajhate the
 Jigar Muradabadi then advised Majrooh Sultanpuri that writing songs for films is not a bad thing
 geet likhane se milane vaali dhan raashi main se kuch paise ve apane parivaar ke kharch ke liye bhej sakate hai
 On the advice of Jigar Muradabadi, Majrooh agreed to write songs in Sultanpuri films
 sangeetkaar naushaad ke liye unhone pehla geet ‘gesu bikharaye, badal aae jhum ke’ kya likhaa, filmi duniya main ek alag hi raah pakad lee
 Films' Shah Jahan ',' Andaz ',' Henna ',' Saathi ',' Pakija ',' Tanghewala ',' Dharamkanta 'and' Guddu ',' Pavement ',' Aarpara ',' Paying Guest ',' Nau Do Eleven ',' Solvent Year ',' Kala Pani ',' Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi ',' Sujata ',' Babu Ka Babu ',' Baat Ek Raat Ki ',' Three Ladies', 'jewelthief', 'paying Guest' and Super movies like 'abhimaan', 'phir third floor', 'bahaar ke sapne', 'pyar ka mausam', 'caravan', 'yaadon ki baraat', 'hum kisne kam nahi hai' and 'jameen ko doshan hai' His written songs also played a big role in being a hit
 25 may, 2000 ko is duniya ko alavida kehane se pehle majaruuh sultanpuri ne chaar dashak se bhi lambey sine kariyar main takreeban 300 filmon ke liye 4000 geet likhe
 He was also awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist for the song 'chahunga Main Tujhe Sanjh Savare' of the film 'dosti', released in 1964
 film jagat main apane mahat yogadan ke liye saal 1993 main majaruuh sultanpuri ko bhartiya cinema ke sarvocch sammaan ‘dada sahab phalke’ se nawaja gaya

 jo naam ab tak khabaron main saamne aae hai unamem sabase zyada ve log hai jo rojgaar srijan se kisi naa kisi tarah se jude hue the
 There are big names like Skill Development Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Sanitation Minister Uma Bharti and Union Labor and Employment Minister Bandaru Dattatreya
 ye teenon hi naam rojgaar evam rojgaar srijan jaise kshetra se bhi jude rahe kyonki uma bharti ke liye bane vishesh mantralay se apeksha thi ki ganga safai ke liye desh main baari maatra main rojgaar srijan hoga
 But regretfully, PM Modi could not do the work he had trusted the three ministers
 teen saal baad kyon hui surgerymodi sarkaar ko ummid thi ki sabhi mantri apane kshetra main behatar kaam karenge or new india kaa sapana saakaar kar dikhaaenge
 However, the Modi government continued to lag behind in the field of employment

 Annoyed with this, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, the Minister of Independent Charge in the Modimodi government, was shown the way out of the cabinet, as the Prime Minister was not very happy with the results of the Ministry of Skill Development
 pradhanmantri modi jal or ganga mantralay kii mantri uma bharti ke safalataa graph se bhi naakhush the

 Amit Shah and the Prime Minister were also said to be angry at the presence of Minister of State for Health in the Modi government, Faggan Singh Kulaste, in Parliament and the absence of attendance at the party's organization programs
 yah bhi bataaya ja rahaa he ki kuch aise mantri bhi hai jinako lo profile kiya ja saktaa he

 The statement of BJP MLA Sangeet Som about the Taj Mahal does not seem to be dissipating
 raajnneetik dalon ke baad ab bollywood se bhi som ke khilaaf swar uthne lage hai
 Famous lyricist Javed Akhtar has also questioned his history knowledge

 upi siem yogi adityanath agra daure par tajmahal bhi dekhne jaaenge
 Here Yogi will also participate in a program of the tourism department

 Along with this, he was asked what treatment he got from the jail administration

 i have one thing to say to you today
 kya aap news channelon yaa media ke anusaar badal rahe hai? aae din netaaon ke nimnastareey raajnneetik bayanon par ghamaasan charchaa hoti he
 Is it that you are considering these discussions as news or information, do you see the transparency of the system by these discussions, the system which you consider as police station, court and officer, is your confidence in it increasing
 kya hota he jab aap kisi jhuthe mukademe ke shikaar hote hai yaa satya ko lekar system se lard jate hai? soochnaaon ke anek madhyam aapke haath main aa gaye hai magar gaur se dekhie zyaadaatar suchanaaen ek jaisi hai
 This uniformity is actually information loss
 aapke paas madhyam he magar soochna ke naam par vahi than-than gopal
 His rally so much, his statements

 Being a citizen means a person equipped with constitutional rights
 jiske sangrakshan ke liye system main kai tarah kii sansthaaen hoti hai
 But do these institutions respect your rights? Do you have control over your rights? Without these rights, the citizen is no more a citizen, he becomes like a living corpse in a democracy, who keeps circling with the police commissioner or the editor or the MP sometimes, carrying his documents on his shoulder
 bharat bhar main aise bahut si zindaa laashen bhatak rahi hai
 junk-junk-cave-earned spokesmen have not only made history a game of football, but they also play football as your questions
 mujhe aae din kai chitthiyaan aati rahati hai
 Which is written to the Prime Minister and also to the President and me
 chitthee likhane waalon ke paas kai baar pradhanmantri karyaalay se prapti kaa patr bhi aata he or phone bhi aa jaataa he magar hota kuch nahin
 After all, even after receiving calls from the Prime Minister's office or writing letters or appearing in the media, the system does not matter
 ham system ke aise sataae logon kii prime time main jansunwaayee shuru kar rahe hai
 There is a small effort that the rubbish spokesperson disappears from the box and the common man gets his place in democracy
 1 disambar ko jab prime time kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha tab maharashtra se 6-7 log milane aae
 i kept waiting for four to five hours to go together
 jab kaarykram ke baad inase milane aayaa to maharashtra se dilli aae in logon ko jaankaree bhi nahin thi ki dilli kii thand kisi hoti he
 Wearing gloves in the hands even in mild cold
 inaki kabhi mujhase phone par baat hui thi, maine yun hi kah diya ki marathi main dastauez hai, main nahin pard saktaa
 i could not believe that many of these documents were translated into Hindi for me
 ek saal se inaki khabaren maharashtra ke angrezi or marathi akhbaaron main chap rahi hai
 But even then nothing happened
 jaise jaise ye log mere saath bag se dastavezon kii photo copy nikaal rahe the, main inaki jagah khud ko dekhne laga
 You too can see their own place
 vah sthiti kitni bhayanak hogi ki maharashtra main nyaay na milane par chaar-paanch log dilli aate hai, patrakaron se milane, pradhanmantri se milane, mantriyon se milane
 Now you understand how the system makes you unarmed and helpless
 aapaki puri zindagi ko dastavezon main samet kar bag main bhar detaa he
 People from Navi Mumbai started folding hands
 system ne inhen itnaa asurakshit kar diya he ki bete kii hatya ke baad maa-baap rose apni hatya hote dekh rahe he
 Shahji Sonawane's 15-year-old son was killed by the bullies because he fell in love with a girl who was not from his caste
 shahji sonavane dalit hai
 Why would you say that a Dalit is because caste is an aspect of honor killing
 isliye dalit bataanaa zaruri he
 All these documents that you are looking at, are not papers, are the dreams of Swapnil
 isamen or mamata ke vakil pati amit kaa koon he isamen
 Which these people have come to Delhi after stuffing them in bags
 dekhie system ne inhen kitna akelaa kar diya he
 The media and the system consider you competent as long as you are part of a large crowd
 jaise hi akele hote hai bharose kii imaarat khojane nikal padate hai
 Every day people carry such stories from news channels to various types of organizations
 zyaadaatar baar aisi kahaniyon ko lautaa diya jaataa he, kyonki news channelon kii shaam betuke bayanon se cat jaati he
 Hard work has to be done for such tales
 sainkadon panne padhane padate hai
 It is necessary to have a reporter who is no longer there
 paramatma kii shrenee ko praapt ho chuke ankar hi bache hai
 Many times these documents do not even have the ability to be understood and maintained
 lekin aam aadmi to mushkil main pad jaataa he
 Therefore, i say that you are not always well with these debates
 ye bahasein aapako akelaa kar rahi hai
 That is why the media drives away such people
 sabhi chitthiyaan report ke laayak nahin hoti hai magar jo hoti hai wo bhi phenk di jaati hai
 Such people are banished without being found
 main khud sambhaal nahin paata
 How can anyone meet so many people? us din mujhase yahi hote-hote batch gaya, lekin jo kahani mili wo main aapako sunaanaa chahta hum
 The incident of 19 July 2016 is the murder of Swapanil Sonwane, the 15-year-old son of State Bank of India's consumer assistant Shahaji Sonwane, in the Nerul area of mumbai
 pita ke anusaar hatya se pehle kuch ladke swapanil ko ghar se lekar auto main jate hai
 They beat him and then take him to the police station
 thane se swapinal ke pita or mata ko soochna milti he
 They have alleged that if the police wanted to, their son could have died, but according to him, the accused started threatening to make the film 'sairat' in front of the police
 sarat main bhi jati tod kar pyaar karne waalon ko hatya ho jaati he
 It has been 16 months since the incident of honor killing, but the victims are not sure that the life of the lawyer who is fighting the case for them is safe
 is ghatana ko maharashtra kii media ne khub chapa he
 The media saw the second part of the film 'sairat' in the murder of a 15-year-old boy, but Swapnil's parents have not yet been able to explain to themselves where some sections of the society come from so much power that the 15-year-old The innocent boy is killed
 hindustan times, di times of india, mumbai mirar, mid de, navabharat times , dabang duniya, dopaher kaa saamana, vrutaratna samraat, aapal mahanagar, mumbai chaufre, sandhyakaal, janmabhumi, gujarat samachar, divya bhaskar, sandesh, indian express, enditivi, tivi 9 ne ise chapa or dikhaaya
 You have seen how the influence of the media has weakened and in turn the common man has become even weaker than that
 20 prakaar ke media main chhapane ke baad bhi inkaa haal ye he ki ye kabhi siem se milte hai to kabhi police kamishnar se milane kii arji lagaate hai
 Why someone has to wander kyon thane ke str par in maamalon kii peshewar jaanch nahin ho sakati? kya koi raajnneetik dabaav he? is maamle main 13 log giraftaar bhi kiye gaye
 5 were also released on bail for different reasons
 indian express ne likhaa he ki teen-teen baar sarkari vakil badale gaye
 Trial did not start for a year
 13 november se trial shuru hone vaala tha, lekin 12 november ko mamata jadhav ke vakil pati amit par jaanaleva hamalaa hota he
 The trial is postponed after the attack
 vakil mamata jadhav apane pati kii suraksha ko lekar itani asurakshit ho jaati he ki dedh saal ke bachche ko saas ke paas chhodkar dilli aa jaati he, pradhanmantri, raashtrapati se guhaar lagane
 Swapnil's parents were wandering with him
 vakil mamata jadhav kii saas aspataal main he jahaan mamata jadhav kaa vakil pati bhartee hai
 The husband underwent an operation on the 4th, but Mamta Jaghav was in Delhi at that time
 mamata ne bataaya ki jab wo or uske pati ne shah sonavane ke bete swapanil kii hatya kaa cese ladanaa shuru kiya to un par hamale hone lage
 These attacks are not stopping and the police is not protecting them
 mamata anusuchit jati ayog bhi gai, mahila ayog bhi gayi
 Swapnil's father wrote a letter to the Chief Minister and the Commissioner of Police asking for lawyer Amit Katarnavre to be tried
 suraksha nahin di gai
 Mamta's husband is attacked twice on 5 September and 12 November
 5 sitambar ke hamale ke baad bhi suraksha nahin di jaati he
 There is no arrest
 12 november kaa hamalaa jaanaleva tha
 Amit gets hit by a rod
 sar phod diya or paanv kooch diya gaya
 No arrests were made
 13 november ko trial shuru hone vaala tha, is hamale ke baad tal gaya he
 Mamta wanted the police negligence to be made responsible for the attack in the FIR
 unke anusaar police chaahati thi ki police kaa naam hataa diya jaae
 In this story, you see who is suffering in front of the system
 yah jansunwaayee he
 First people will speak and then the police will put their side, then they will definitely put their side in front of you
 is episod main police kaa paksh nahin he jo peedit hai unka he
 Mamta says that after the November 12 attack, the FIR was lodged in her name despite being a wife
 mumkin he aapako yah kahani boring lagegi
 Remember, when you come in such a situation, the rest of the audience and the media will find your story boring and taking advantage of it, the system will break you
 tippaniyan Mamta Jadhav said that ever since the case of murder of Swapnil has taken place, in the same month, a sudden FIR is started against him
 6 aktubar 2016 ko ek FIR number i396 / 16 main mamata or unke pati aaropee banaae jate hai
 Mamata and husband Amit are made accused in FIR number i400 / 16 on 8 October 2016
 8 aktubar 2016 ko FIR main amit or anya ko aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 Two separate firs are also registered on 9 October 2016
 ek main pati-patni or ek main pati ko aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 On October 9, another FIR is filed against husband Amit and others
 13 or 14 aktubar ko mamata jadhav or amit ke kilaaf FIR hoti he
 Where do all the firs suddenly come against the lawyers who are there
 inamen se kai main in vakil pati-patni par farji jati pramaan patr banavaane main madad kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 Were all these firs done to pressure them? a 15-year-old son is killed, a lawyer is ready to fight his case, but you see that sometimes the case is facing attack
 mamata kahati hai ki hamalavar kabhi mantri kaa naam lete hai, kabhi police kaa naam lete hai
 So we make them accused in our complaint
 ye log dilli isliye aae hai ki mamata ke pati ko suraksha mil sake or hamalaa na ho
 These people are making applications and giving them everywhere
 mamata jadhav or swapanil ke pita or maa mumbai waapas ravaanaa ho chuke hai
 Mamta Jadhav told over the phone that some security personnel were employed in the hospital after the attack under the protection of her husband, she has been removed
 hamane police adhikariyon se baat karne kaa prayaas kiya magar baat nahin ho saki
 Some disconnected the phone, some postponed it
 ab ye kahani aapse kya kahati he, ek kamazor paksh ko insaaf ke liye kitna ladanaa padataa he
 The system weakens it further
 is dauraan wo kitni mautein marataa he, kis asuraksha ke maahaul main jeeta he
 Apart from the shock of death, there is no account of money and time
 bete ko bhi maar diya gaya or jo insaaf ke liye lard rahe hai wo rose mar rahe hai
 It may be that they are lacking in favor, but is it not right that the system kills man
 system ke saamne aam aadmi nihattha khadaa he
 Where do you stand, don't you think the question is important that the system should work in a professional manner and without any discrimination for everyone
 aapke paas madhyam he magar soochna ke naam par vahi than-than gopal
 His rally so much, his statements
 media khud bhi kamazor hua he or saath-saath aapako bhi kamazor karata ja rahaa he

 Hard work has to be done for such tales
 sainkadon panne padhane padate hai
 It is necessary to have a reporter who is no longer there
 paramatma kii shrenee ko praapt ho chuke ankar hi bache hai
 Many times these documents do not even have the ability to be understood and maintained
 lekin aam aadmi to mushkil main pad jaataa he
 Therefore, i say that you are not always well with these debates
 ye bahasein aapako akelaa kar rahi hai
 That is why the media drives away such people
 sabhi chitthiyaan report ke laayak nahin hoti hai magar jo hoti hai wo bhi phenk di jaati hai
 Such people are banished without being found
 main khud sambhaal nahin paata
 How can anyone meet so many people? us din mujhase yahi hote-hote batch gaya, lekin jo kahani mili wo main aapako sunaanaa chahta hum
 The incident of 19 July 2016 is the murder of Swapanil Sonwane, the 15-year-old son of State Bank of India's consumer assistant Shahaji Sonwane, in the Nerul area of mumbai
 pita ke anusaar hatya se pehle kuch ladke swapanil ko ghar se lekar auto main jate hai
 They beat him and then take him to the police station
 thane se swapinal ke pita or mata ko soochna milti he
 They have alleged that if the police wanted to, their son could have died, but according to him, the accused started threatening to make the film 'sairat' in front of the police
 sarat main bhi jati tod kar pyaar karne waalon ko hatya ho jaati he
 It has been 16 months since the incident of honor killing, but the victims are not sure that the life of the lawyer who is fighting the case for them is safe
 is ghatana ko maharashtra kii media ne khub chapa he
 The media saw the second part of the film 'sairat' in the murder of a 15-year-old boy, but Swapnil's parents have not yet been able to explain to themselves where some sections of the society come from so much power that the 15-year-old The innocent boy is killed

 You have seen how the influence of the media has weakened and in turn the common man has become even weaker than that
 20 prakaar ke media main chhapane ke baad bhi inkaa haal ye he ki ye kabhi siem se milte hai to kabhi police kamishnar se milane kii arji lagaate hai
 Why someone has to wander kyon thane ke str par in maamalon kii peshewar jaanch nahin ho sakati? kya koi raajnneetik dabaav he? is maamle main 13 log giraftaar bhi kiye gaye
 5 were also released on bail for different reasons
 indian express ne likhaa he ki teen-teen baar sarkari vakil badale gaye
 Trial did not start for a year
 13 november se trial shuru hone vaala tha, lekin 12 november ko mamata jadhav ke vakil pati amit par jaanaleva hamalaa hota he
 The trial is postponed after the attack
 vakil mamata jadhav apane pati kii suraksha ko lekar itani asurakshit ho jaati he ki dedh saal ke bachche ko saas ke paas chhodkar dilli aa jaati he, pradhanmantri, raashtrapati se guhaar lagane
 Swapnil's parents were wandering with him
 vakil mamata jadhav kii saas aspataal main he jahaan mamata jadhav kaa vakil pati bhartee hai
 The husband underwent an operation on the 4th, but Mamta Jaghav was in Delhi at that time
 mamata ne bataaya ki jab wo or uske pati ne shah sonavane ke bete swapanil kii hatya kaa cese ladanaa shuru kiya to un par hamale hone lage
 These attacks are not stopping and the police is not protecting them
 mamata anusuchit jati ayog bhi gai, mahila ayog bhi gayi
 Swapnil's father wrote a letter to the Chief Minister and the Commissioner of Police asking for lawyer Amit Katarnavre to be tried
 suraksha nahin di gai
 Mamta's husband is attacked twice on 5 September and 12 November
 5 sitambar ke hamale ke baad bhi suraksha nahin di jaati he
 The issue does not ar e
 12 november kaa hamalaa jaanaleva tha
 Amit gets hit by a rod
 sar phod diya or paanv kooch diya gaya
 No arrests were made
 13 november ko trial shuru hone vaala tha, is hamale ke baad tal gaya he
 Mamta wanted the police negligence to be made responsible for the attack in the FIR
 unke anusaar police chaahati thi ki police kaa naam hataa diya jaae
 In this story, you see who is suffering in front of the system
 yah jansunwaayee he
 First people will speak and then the police will put their side, then they will definitely put their side in front of you
 is episod main police kaa paksh nahin he jo peedit hai unka he
 Mamta says that after the November 12 attack, the FIR was lodged in her name despite being a wife
 mumkin he aapako yah kahani boring lagegi
 Remember, when you come in such a situation, the rest of the audience and the media will find your story boring and taking advantage of it, the system will break you
 tippaniyan Mamta Jadhav said that ever since the case of murder of Swapnil has taken place, in the same month, a sudden FIR is started against him
 6 aktubar 2016 ko ek FIR number i396 / 16 main mamata or unke pati aaropee banaae jate hai
 Mamata and husband Amit are made accused in FIR number i400 / 16 on 8 October 2016
 8 aktubar 2016 ko FIR main amit or anya ko aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 Two separate firs are also registered on 9 October 2016
 ek main pati-patni or ek main pati ko aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 On October 9, another FIR is filed against husband Amit and others
 13 or 14 aktubar ko mamata jadhav or amit ke kilaaf FIR hoti he
 Where do all the firs suddenly come against the lawyers who are there
 inamen se kai main in vakil pati-patni par farji jati pramaan patr banavaane main madad kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 Were all these firs done to pressure them? a 15-year-old son is killed, a lawyer is ready to fight his case, but you see that sometimes the case is facing attack
 mamata kahati hai ki hamalavar kabhi mantri kaa naam lete hai, kabhi police kaa naam lete hai
 So we make them accused in our complaint
 ye log dilli isliye aae hai ki mamata ke pati ko suraksha mil sake or hamalaa na ho
 These people are making applications and giving them everywhere
 mamata jadhav or swapanil ke pita or maa mumbai waapas ravaanaa ho chuke hai
 Mamta Jadhav told over the phone that some security personnel were employed in the hospital after the attack under the protection of her husband, she has been removed
 hamane police adhikariyon se baat karne kaa prayaas kiya magar baat nahin ho saki
 Some disconnected the phone, some postponed it
 ab ye kahani aapse kya kahati he, ek kamazor paksh ko insaaf ke liye kitna ladanaa padataa he
 The system weakens it further
 is dauraan wo kitni mautein marataa he, kis asuraksha ke maahaul main jeeta he
 Apart from the shock of death, there is no account of money and time
 bete ko bhi maar diya gaya or jo insaaf ke liye lard rahe hai wo rose mar rahe hai
 It may be that they are lacking in favor, but is it not right that the system kills man
 system ke saamne aam aadmi nihattha khadaa he
 Where do you stand, don't you think the question is important that the system should work in a professional manner and without any discrimination for everyone
 akhir kya baat he ki pradhanmantri karyaalay se phone aane yaa chitthee likhane yaa media main chhapane ke baad bhi system ko fark nahin padataa
 We are starting public hearing in the prime time of such persecuted people of the system
 choti si koshish he ki bakse se bakawaas pravaktaa gaayab ho or aam aadmi ko loktantr main uski jagah mili
 On December 1, while preparing for prime time, 6-7 people from Maharashtra came to meet
 chaar paanch ghante tak meraa intazaar karte rahe ki mil kar hi jaaenge
 When they came to meet him after the program, these people who came to Delhi from Maharashtra did not even know how cold Delhi is
 maamuli thand main bhi hatho main dastaane pahan liye the
 He once spoke to me on the phone, i just said that there are documents in Marathi, i cannot read
 mujhe yakeen nahin hua ki ye mere liye kai dacument hindi main anuwaad kar laae the
 For a year, his news has been published in the English and Marathi newspapers of Maharashtra
 magar iske baad bhi kuch nahin hua
 As these people were taking out photo copies of documents from the bag with me, i started looking at them instead
 aap bhi inaki jagah khud ko dekhie
 How terrible that situation will be when four-five people come to Delhi if they do not get justice in Maharashtra, to meet journalists, meet the Prime Minister, meet the ministers
 ab aapako samaj aayaa ki system kaise aapako nihattha or laachaar kar detaa he
 Stuffs your entire life into documents and stuffs it in the bag
 naveen mumbai se aae log haath jodne lage
 The system has made them so insecure that after the son's murder, the parents are watching their killings everyday
 shahji sonaavne ke 15 saal ke bete ko isliye dabangon ne maar diya kyonki usne ek aisi ladki se pyaar kar liya jo uski jati kii nahin thi
 Shahji Sonawane is a Dalit
 aap kahenge ki dalit kyon kaha kyonki honor kiling main jati ek pahalu hoti he
 Therefore, it is important to declare Dalit
 ye sab dastauez jo aap dekh rahe hai, kagaz nahin hai, swapanil kii laash he
 There is a blood in it and Mamta's lawyer husband Amit
 jise ye log thile main bharkar dilli aae hai
 See how lonely the system has made them
 media or system aapako tabhi tak sakasham samajhataa he jab tak aap kisi badi bheed kaa hissaa hote hai
 As soon as they are alone, they start searching for a building of trust
 aae din aisi kahaniyon ko dhote hue log news channelon se lekar tamaam tarah kii sansthaaon ke chakkar lagaate rahete hai
 Most of the time such stories are returned, as the evening of news channels is cut off by absurd statements
 aisi dastaanon ke liye vaaki mehnat kerani padati he
 Hundreds of pages have to be read
 reporter kii zarur padati he jo ab hai nahin
 Only the anchors who have attained the divine status remain
 kai baar in dastavezon ko samajhane or baratane kii yogyata bhi nahin hoti he
 But the common man is in trouble
 isliye kahata hum ki in bahason se aapkaa hameshaa bhala nahin he
 These debates are singling you out
 isiilie media aise logon ko bhaga detaa he
 Not all letters are worth reporting, but what happens is also thrown away
 aise log bina mili bhaga die jate hai
 i can not handle myself
 itane logon se kaise koi mil saktaa he
 That day survived me as it happened, but i want to tell you the story i got
 19 july 2016 kii ghatana he mumbai ke nerul ilaake kii yaheen par state bank of india ke upabhokta sahaayak shahji sonavane ke 15 saal ke bete swapanil sonavane kii hatya hoti he
 According to the father, some boys take Swapnil from home to auto before killing
 uski pitayee karte hai or phir thane le jate hai
 From the police station, the father and mother of Swapinal get information
 inkaa aarope he ki police chaahati to unka betaa mar saktaa tha magar unke anusaar aaropee police ke saamne hi 'sarat' film tu banane kii dhamkee dene lage
 In Sairat too, those who fall in love by breaking caste are killed
 honor kiling kii ghatana ko 16 maheene ho gaye magar peediton ko bharosa nahin he ki unki or unke liye cese lard rahe vakil kii jaan surakshit he
 This incident has been heavily published by the media of Maharashtra
 media ko 15 saal ke ek ladke kii hatya main 'sarat' film kaa doosraa hissaa nazar aayaa magar swapanil ke maa baap abhi tak khud ko nahin samajha paae hai ki samaaj ke kuch tabakon ke paas itani takat kahaan se aa jaati he ki 15 saal ke abodh ladke kii hatya ho jaati he
 Hindustan Times, The Times of India, Mumbai Mirror, Midday, Navbharat Times, Dabang Duniya, Noon Saamna, Vratratna Samrat, Aapal Mahanagar, Mumbai Chaufferay, Sandyakal, Janmabhoomi, Gujarat News, Divya Bhaskar, Sandesh, Indian Express, NDTV, TV9 featured and featured it
 aapane dekha ki kis tarah media kaa asar kamazor hua he or badal main aam aadmi usase bhi zyaada kamazor hua he
 Even after appearing in 20 types of media, their condition is that sometimes they meet the CM and sometimes they petition to meet the Police Commissioner
 kyon kisi ko bhatakana padataa he
 Why cannot there be a professional investigation of these cases at the station level? Is there any political pressure? 13 people were also arrested in this case
 5 alag-alag kaarnon se zamaanat par reeha bhi hue
 The Indian Express has written that government lawyers were changed thrice
 ek saal tak trial hi shuru nahin hua
 The trial was scheduled to begin on November 13, but on November 12, Mamta Jadhav's lawyer husband Amit is attacked with a fatal attack
 hamale ke baad trial tal jaataa he
 Advocate Mamta Jadhav becomes so insecure about her husband's safety that she leaves a one and a half year old child in law and comes to Delhi, pleading with the Prime Minister and the President
 uske saath swapanil ke mata-pita bhi bhatak rahe the
 Lawyer Mamta Jadhav's mother-in-law is in the hospital where Mamta Jadhav's lawyer husband is admitted
 4 taarikh ko pati kaa oparation ho gaya magar us vakt mamata jaghav dilli main thim
 Mamta told that when she and her husband started fighting the case of the murder of Shah Sonwane's son Swapnil, they started getting attacked
 ye hamale ruuk hi nahin rahe hai or police unhen suraksha nahin de rahi he
 Mamta also went to the Scheduled Castes Commission, also to the Women's Commission
 swapanil ke pita ne mukhyamantri or police kamishnar ko patr likhaa tha ki vakil amit kataranvare ko surajha di jaae
 Security not provided
 mamata ke pati par 5 sitambar or 12 november ko do baar hamalaa hota he
 Security is not provided even after the September 5 attack
 koi giraftaar nahin hoti he
 The attack on 12 November was fatal
 amit ko rod se maaraa gaya
 He broke his head and was crushed
 koi giraftaar nahin hai
 The trial was scheduled to begin on 13 November, postponed following the attack
 mamata chaahati thi ki exiaar main hamale ke liye police kii laaparvaahee ko bhi zimmedaar banaaya jaae
 According to him, the police wanted the name of the police to be removed
 aap is kahani main dekhie ki system ke saamne koun peedit he
 This is public hearing
 pehle log bolenge phir police apana paksh rakhegi to uskaa paksh aapke saamne zarur rakhenge
 This episode does not favor the police who are the victims
 mamata kahati hai ki 12 november ke hamale ke baad exiaar darj karaane gai to patni hote hue bhi unke naam se exiaar darj nahin kii gai
 It is possible that you will find this story boring
 yaad rakhiegaa, jab aap aisi sthiti main aaenge to baaki darshakon or media ko bhi aapaki kahani boring lagegi or iskaa phayda uthaakar system aapako tod degaa
 The comments mamata jadhav ne bataaya ki jab se swapanil kii hatya kaa cese liya he tab se ek hi maheene main unke upar achaanak danaadan exiaar hone lagati he
 Mamata and her husband are accused in an FIR number i396 / 16 on 6 October 2016
 8 aktubar 2016 ko FIR number i400 / 16 main mamata or pati amit aaropee banaae jate hai
 On 8 October 2016, Amit and others are charged in the FIR
 9 aktubar 2016 ko bhi do alag-alag FIR darj hoti he
 In one, the husband-wife and in one the husband are accused
 9 aktubar ko ek or FIR pati amit or anya ke khilaaf hoti he
 On October 13 and 14, an FIR is registered against Mamta Jadhav and Amit
 jo vakil hai unke kilaaf achaanak se itane FIR kahaan se aa jate hai
 In many of these, these lawyer spouses are accused of helping to create fake caste certificates
 kya ye saare exiaar in par dabaav banane ke liye kiye gaye? 15 saal ke ek bete kii hatya hoti he, uskaa cese ek vakil ladane ko taiyaar hota he magar aap dekhie ki kabhi mukademe to kabhi hamale kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Mamta says that the attackers sometimes take the name of the minister, sometimes the name of the police
 isliye ham apni shikaayat main inhen aaropee banaate hai
 These people have come to Delhi so that Mamta's husband can get protection and there is no attack
 ye log arji banaakar har jagah de rahe hai
 Mamta Jadhav and Swapnil's father and mother have left for Mumbai
 mamata jadhav ne phone par bataaya ki unke pati kii suraksha main hamale ke baad aspataal main kuch suraksha karmi lage the, unhen hataa liya gaya he
 We tried to talk to the police officers but could not speak
 kuch ne phone kaat diya, kuch ne baat taal di
 Now what does this story tell you, how much a weak side has to fight for justice
 system use or kamazor kar detaa he
 During this, how many deaths he dies, in which insecurity lives
 maut ke sadame ke alaava paisa or vakt kaa to hisaab hi nahin
 The son was also killed and those fighting for justice are dying every day
 ho saktaa he ki inke paksh main kami ho lekin kya yah sahi nahin he ki system aadmi ko maar detaa he
 The common man stands unarmed in front of the system
 aap kahaan khadey hai, kya aapako yah sawaal mahatvapurn nahin lagata ki system sabake liye peshewar tareeke se or bina kisi bhedbhaav ke kaam karnaa chahie
 Now you understand how the system makes you unarmed and helpless
 aapaki puri zindagi ko dastavezon main samet kar bag main bhar detaa he
 People from Navi Mumbai started folding hands
 system ne inhen itnaa asurakshit kar diya he ki bete kii hatya ke baad maa-baap rose apni hatya hote dekh rahe he
 Shahji Sonawane's 15-year-old son was killed by the bullies because he fell in love with a girl who was not from his caste
 shahji sonavane dalit hai
 Why would you say that a Dalit is because caste is an aspect of honor killing
 isliye dalit bataanaa zaruri he
 All these documents that you are looking at, are not papers, are the dreams of Swapnil
 isamen or mamata ke vakil pati amit kaa koon he isamen
 Which these people have come to Delhi after stuffing them in bags
 dekhie system ne inhen kitna akelaa kar diya he
 The media and the system consider you competent as long as you are part of a large crowd
 jaise hi akele hote hai bharose kii imaarat khojane nikal padate hai
 Every day people carry such stories from news channels to various types of organizations
 zyaadaatar baar aisi kahaniyon ko lautaa diya jaataa he, kyonki news channelon kii shaam betuke bayanon se cat jaati he
 Hard work has to be done for such tales
 sainkadon panne padhane padate hai
 It is necessary to have a reporter who is no longer there
 paramatma kii shrenee ko praapt ho chuke ankar hi bache hai
 Many times these documents do not even have the ability to be understood and maintained
 lekin aam aadmi to mushkil main pad jaataa he
 Therefore, i say that you are not always well with these debates
 ye bahasein aapako akelaa kar rahi hai
 That is why the media drives away such people
 sabhi chitthiyaan report ke laayak nahin hoti hai magar jo hoti hai wo bhi phenk di jaati hai
 Such people are banished without being found

 yaad rakhiegaa, jab aap aisi sthiti main aaenge to baaki darshakon or media ko bhi aapaki kahani boring lagegi or iskaa phayda uthaakar system aapako tod degaa
 The comments mamata jadhav ne bataaya ki jab se swapanil kii hatya kaa cese liya he tab se ek hi maheene main unke upar achaanak danaadan exiaar hone lagati he
 Mamata and her husband are accused in an FIR number i396 / 16 on 6 October 2016
 8 aktubar 2016 ko FIR number i400 / 16 main mamata or pati amit aaropee banaae jate hai
 On 8 October 2016, Amit and others are charged in the FIR
 9 aktubar 2016 ko bhi do alag-alag FIR darj hoti he
 In one, the husband-wife and in one the husband are accused
 9 aktubar ko ek or FIR pati amit or anya ke khilaaf hoti he
 On October 13 and 14, an FIR is registered against Mamta Jadhav and Amit
 jo vakil hai unke kilaaf achaanak se itane FIR kahaan se aa jate hai
 In many of these, these lawyer spouses are accused of helping to create fake caste certificates
 kya ye saare exiaar in par dabaav banane ke liye kiye gaye? 15 saal ke ek bete kii hatya hoti he, uskaa cese ek vakil ladane ko taiyaar hota he magar aap dekhie ki kabhi mukademe to kabhi hamale kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Mamta says that the attackers sometimes take the name of the minister, sometimes the name of the police
 isliye ham apni shikaayat main inhen aaropee banaate hai
 These people have come to Delhi so that Mamta's husband can get protection and there is no attack
 ye log arji banaakar har jagah de rahe hai
 Mamta Jadhav and Swapnil's father and mother have left for Mumbai
 mamata jadhav ne phone par bataaya ki unke pati kii suraksha main hamale ke baad aspataal main kuch suraksha karmi lage the, unhen hataa liya gaya he
 We tried to talk to the police officers but could not speak
 kuch ne phone kaat diya, kuch ne baat taal di
 Now what does this story tell you, how much a weak side has to fight for justice
 system use or kamazor kar detaa he
 During this, how many deaths he dies, in which insecurity lives
 maut ke sadame ke alaava paisa or vakt kaa to hisaab hi nahin
 The son was also killed and those fighting for justice are dying every day
 ho saktaa he ki inke paksh main kami ho lekin kya yah sahi nahin he ki system aadmi ko maar detaa he
 The common man stands unarmed in front of the system
 aap kahaan khadey hai, kya aapako yah sawaal mahatvapurn nahin lagata ki system sabake liye peshewar tareeke se or bina kisi bhedbhaav ke kaam karnaa chahie
 Mamta Jadhav said that ever since the case of murder of Swapnil has taken place, in the same month, a sudden FIR is started against him
 6 aktubar 2016 ko ek FIR number i396 / 16 main mamata or unke pati aaropee banaae jate hai
 Mamata and husband Amit are made accused in FIR number i400 / 16 on 8 October 2016
 8 aktubar 2016 ko FIR main amit or anya ko aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 Two separate firs are also registered on 9 October 2016
 ek main pati-patni or ek main pati ko aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 On October 9, another FIR is filed against husband Amit and others
 13 or 14 aktubar ko mamata jadhav or amit ke kilaaf FIR hoti he
 Where do all the firs suddenly come against the lawyers who are there
 inamen se kai main in vakil pati-patni par farji jati pramaan patr banavaane main madad kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 Were all these firs done to pressure them? a 15-year-old son is killed, a lawyer is ready to fight his case, but you see that sometimes the case is facing attack
 mamata kahati hai ki hamalavar kabhi mantri kaa naam lete hai, kabhi police kaa naam lete hai
 So we make them accused in our complaint
 ye log dilli isliye aae hai ki mamata ke pati ko suraksha mil sake or hamalaa na ho
 These people are making applications and giving them everywhere
 mamata jadhav or swapanil ke pita or maa mumbai waapas ravaanaa ho chuke hai
 Mamta Jadhav told over the phone that some security personnel were employed in the hospital after the attack under the protection of her husband, she has been removed
 hamane police adhikariyon se baat karne kaa prayaas kiya magar baat nahin ho saki
 Some disconnected the phone, some postponed it
 ab ye kahani aapse kya kahati he, ek kamazor paksh ko insaaf ke liye kitna ladanaa padataa he
 The system weakens it further
 is dauraan wo kitni mautein marataa he, kis asuraksha ke maahaul main jeeta he
 Apart from the shock of death, there is no account of money and time
 bete ko bhi maar diya gaya or jo insaaf ke liye lard rahe hai wo rose mar rahe hai
 It may be that they are lacking in favor, but is it not right that the system kills man
 system ke saamne aam aadmi nihattha khadaa he
 Where do you stand, don't you think the question is important that the system should work in a professional manner and without any discrimination for everyone

 It is a matter of great embarrassment that the Police Commissioner's Twitter homepage still has a picture of former Commissioner Neeraj Kumar
 No case against Indian Express
 It is a rumor the Delhi Police denies unequivocally
 — delhi police (@delhipolice2)december 31, 2012police kamishnar ke twitor pej par dekhne se pataa chalata he ki is par aakhri massej 31 disambar 2012 ko post kiya tha

 dilli police ke nae mukhiya bi es bassi ne janvari main media se baatcheet main kaha tha ki wo jald hi twitor kaa istemaal karnaa shuru karenge
 However, even after almost two months, the Delhi Police has neither updated the profile of the new commissioner nor the new commissioner's Twitter account
 haalanki, mahilaon or bacchon kii madad ke liye dilli police kii special unit (SPUWC) kii twitor ke saath-saath fasebuk par bhi account hai
 But, there are only seven posts on its Twitter page and the last tweet was done on October 5, 2012
 north korea ke taanashaah kim jong unne 10 adhikariyon ko tivi serial dekhne ke chalate maut kii sajaa di he
 Disclosing the incident on Wednesday, the Korean intelligence agency reported that the dictator has sentenced 50 officers to death so far this year
 south korea kii is khufia agency ne daawa kiya ki haal hi main sattarudh party ke 10 workars ko dakshin korea ke tivi kaarykram dekhne, ghoose lene or auraton se sambandh ke maamle ke aarope main goliyon se bhun diya gaya
 Some of these officers were those who were special to Uncle Jeng Song Thaek of Kim Jong Un
 jeng song thaek ko pichley saal disambar main deshadroh or rajya ke pratikrime karne ke aarope main giraftaar kar maut kii sajaa di ja chuki he
 This information about the death of the officials was handed over to the South Korean court on Tuesday through an intelligence report
 iske liye rajnatik pandit hone kii jarurat nahin he ki bihar ke chunaav main bade nuksaan ke baavjood rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne jaateey aarakshan kii samiksha kii bahes kyon shuru kii tajjub sangh ke dizin par nahin balki is baat par he ki sarkaar ne ret main sir dhansa diya or ek jaruri bahes kii gardan sansad ke bheetar hi marod di jabaki koi himmati sarkaar ise ek mauka banaakar sakaaratmak bahes kii shuruyaat kar sakati thi
 The Sangh's suggestion links to its broader religious-cultural agenda, which is disputed, but even then, in light of the aggressiveness of the Jat and Patidar agitation of Haryana and the benefits of reservation to the affluent sections, one would agree with the Sangh's logic That the discussion on the review of caste reservation should begin
 khaas taur par us vakt jab desh ke paas taaja aarthik jaateey gananaa ke aankade maujuud hai, jin par sarkaar chuppi saadhe baithi he
 The urge to maintain status quo in the caste reservation has always been strong, due to which the BJP and the government had to reject the suggestion of the Sangh
 jaateey aarakshan kii samiksha par sarkaar kaa inkaar, darasal, bijepi or sangh ke bich saidhantik asahmatiyon kaa prasthaan bindu he jo sangh ke saanskrithik agenda ko bijepi kii raajnneeti ke rasayan se alag karata he
 Similar disagreements were seen on the economic and religious (ram Mandir) agenda between Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the Sangh
 sarkaar bhale hi inkaar kare lekin aarakshan kii samiksha kii bahes shuru ho chuki he jo jaateey pahchaan kii nahin balki rojgaar ke bazaar kii he
 No one will deny the fact that reservation has successfully balanced caste representation in elected institutions (from panchayat to legislature) and political positions and there is no objection to continuation of this reservation
 aarakshan kii asli jamini jaddojahad to sarkari naukariyon main hissedari ko lekar he
 If the employment market is enlarged, then the craziness of reservation in government jobs can be handled
 aarakshan kii bahes ke is gaiyr-rajnatik sandarbh ko samajhane ke liye rojgaron ke bazaar ko samajhnaa jaruri he
 Reliable employment figures are not available in India, so it is difficult to examine the historical benefits of facilities like reservation
 phir bhi jo aankade (world iconomic forum or aarthik samiksha 2015-16) milte hai unke mutabik, naukareepesha logon kii kul sankhya keval 4
 9 crores which is 1
 28 arab kii aabaadi main bekaari kii bhayavahata kaa pramaan he
 Of these, 94 percent are employed in the unorganized sector, while only four percent are in the organized sector which includes both government and private employment
 taaja aarthik samiksha bataati he ki 2012 main sangathit kshetra main kul 2
 95 crore people were working, 1 of which
 76 karod log sarkari kshetra main the
 This small figure of government jobs includes central and state jobs
 centre sarkaar main railway, sena or bank sabase bade rojgaar hub hai lekin inamen kisi kii naukariyon kii sankhya itani bhi nahin he ki vah 10 fisadi aavednon ko bhi jagah de sake
 About 60 per cent of the posts in central government jobs are in Group c and about 29 per cent in Group D, which are the lowest paid category in government jobs
 sarkari kshetra kii shesh naukariyaan rajyon main hai or vahaan bhi naukariyon kaa dhaancha lagbhag centre sarkaar jaisaa he
 It is important to understand from this figure that the entire struggle for reservation is for less than two crore jobs, most of which are of Group c and D, due to which there has been so much politics for years
 gaur talab he ki sarkaron kaa aakaar kam ho rahaa he jiske saath hi naukariyaan ghatati jaani hai
 The Economic Review states that the pace of increase in government jobs is less than one per cent, while the pace of increase in jobs in organized private sector is 5
 6 fisadi rahi he
 But the organized (government and private) sector provides only six per cent of employment, so the fluctuation of this share in the employment market does not make a big difference
 sabase zyada rojgaar asangathit kshetra main hai jiskaa thos aankada uplabdh nahin he alabatta itnaa jarur pataa he ki asangathit kshetra jaise vyapaar va retail, laghu udyog, parivahan, bhawan nirmaan, dasiyon kii tarah kii sevaayen bharat main kisi bhi sarkari tantra se zyada rojgaar de rahe hai
 All these businesses are part of India's huge livelihood network which also generates employment along with its growth
 naukariyaan badhaane ke liye bharat main vishaal jeevika tantra ko vistrut karnaa hoga jiske liye bhartiya bazaar ko or kholana jaruri he kyonki bharat main naukariyaan yaa jeevika antat nijee kshetra se hi aani hai
 If the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh wants to start the reservation debate with due course, it has to agree on the fact that India needs extensive privatization, investment and foreign investment to increase the job market and shut down the politics of the reservation of a handful of government jobs
 Maybe, it is only those sections that are standing in the front line
 aarakshan kii bahes main utarane ke do tareeke ho sakate hai
 One is to look at it from the perspective of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which wants to fill the caste gaps in the path of religious nationalist agenda and the second way is to accept the status quo in the urges of caste politics and reject the debate as the government did
 inke alaava ek teesraa rasta bhi he jahaan aarakshan kii bahes ko hamen sarkari rojgaron tak simit rakhane kii bajaae sabko jeevika kii bahes tak le janaa hoga
 We have to debate policies that ensure livelihood to all, that livelihood can come from anywhere, any area, which will include both jobs and entrepreneurship
 iske baad hi aarakshan par vah bahes shuru ho sakegi jisase puraa desh judsa chahega

 elahabaad hoicourt main chal rahe 60 saal puraane babari masjid ramajnmabhumi malikana haq vivaad kaa faisla sunaane kaa maarg prashast karte hue supreme court ne faisle ko sthagit karne kaa aagrah karte hue daayar yachika khaarij kar di
 Now the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court will give its verdict in this case on 30 September
 adaalat ne faisla sunaane ke liye dopaher baad 3
 Have set the time for 30 o'clock
 pradhan nyaayadhish es ech kapaadiya kii adhyakshata main gathit teen sadasyeey peeth ne apane sankshipt aadesh main kaha ki sambhddha pakshon kii daleelon par vistaar se vichaar karne ke baad hamaari raay bani he ki vishesh anumati yachika khaarij kii jaye or is tarah yah yachika khaarij kii jaati he
 On September 23, the apex court gave its verdict based on a petition filed in the Supreme Court by retired bureaucrat Ramesh Chandra Tripathi, requesting the postponement of the Allahabad High Court's decision to resolve the ownership dispute through negotiation on September 24
 But notice was issued to all the parties, putting an interim stay
 lagbhag do ghante tak sabhi pakshon kii daleel sunne ke baad supreme court ne yah yachika khaarij kar di
 The three-member bench of the Supreme Court, however, did not clearly give any reason for its decision nor did it set a date for the Allahabad High Court to pronounce the verdict
 supreme court ke is faisle ke baad ummid kii ja rahi he ki elahabaad hoicourt jaldi hi ayodhya malikana haq maamle par apana faisla suna degaa kyonki maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi peeth ke teen nyaayadhishon main se ek, nyaayamurti dharmaveer sharma ek aktubar ko hi sevanivrutt ho rahe hai
 Earlier, Attorney General GE Vahanvati said that there should not be a situation of uncertainty
 pradhan nyaayadhish es ech kapadia, nyaayamurti aftab alam or nyaayamurti ke es radhakrishnan kii teen sadasyeey peeth ke samaksh pesh hote hue vaahnavati ne kaha ki is maamle main sarvaadhik vaanchit hal tha baatcheet ke jariye nikaalane vaala samaadhaan, lekin aisa nahin hua or abhi jo anishchay kii sthiti bani hui he, use jari nahin rahane dena chaiye
 a three-member bench of the Supreme Court unanimously decided to dismiss Tripathi's petition
 peeth ke samaksh apni daleel main atarni general ne kaha ki 1999 se sarkaar is maamle kaa baatcheet se hal nikaale jane ke paksh main he lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 He said that we want the matter to be resolved somehow
 ham kanoon evam vyavastha kii mashinari ko nilambit nahin rakh sakate
 Vahanvati said that my position is absolutely clear
 meraa vichaar he ki maamle kaa faisla diya janaa chaiye
 According to the mandate of 1994, we should do the same
 unhone ayodhya main vivaadit bhoomi ke adhigrahan par samvidhan peeth ke faisle kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He dismissed Rohatgi's allegation that the Center remained silent on the matter and remained only as a receiver of the disputed land
 vaahnavati ne kaha ki sarkaar kanoon kaa shashan behaal karne ko katibaddh he or 14 sitambar 1994 ko sheersh nyaayalay ko diye apane us aashwaasan kaa paalan karne ko patibaddh he
 The Attorney General also denied Rohatgi's plea that the government was not proactive about resolving the matter through dialogue and negotiation process
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kanoon ke shashan kaa sammaan karne main vishwaas rakhti he
 Vahanvati also rejected Rohatgi's plea that the government could extend the tenure of the retired judge of the bench that gave the verdict of Allahabad High Court
 unhone kaha ki is sambandh main kendra ko koi adhikaar nahin he
 This right belongs to the Chief Justice of the High Court and the Collegium of the Supreme Court can recommend it to some extent in this case
 isse pehle maamle par faisla taalane kaa aagrah karne vaale paksh ke vakil ne daleel di ki adaalat or sarkaar is maamle ko adaalat se baahar baatcheet ke jariye hal karne ke liye nayi pahal kar sakati he
 However, barring the Nirmohi Akhara, all other parties involved in the case opposed the postponement of the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court hearing the sixty-year-old verdict
 treepathi kii ore se sheersh adaalat main pesh hue varisht vakil mukul rohtagi ne adaalat main kaha ki yah bhaawanaaon se judaa maamla he or adaalat or sarkaar ko is maamle kaa baatcheet ke jariye hal karne ke liye sakriy pahal kerani chaiye
 Referring to the possibility of a fresh hearing on the case on the retirement of one of the three judges of the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court, he said that there are measures through which the government can tackle the problem
 sevanivrutt hone vaale nyaayadhish kii pun: niyukti kii ja sakati he athwa unke uttaradhikari unke faisle ko suna saktaa he
 Rohatgi also argued that after the government's land acquisition in 1993, no ownership matter could be pending
 unhone kaha ki lakhanu peeth ke teen nyaayadhish bhi baatcheet ke jariye maamle kaa hal niklane kii jarurat par sahamat the or 24 sitambar tak kii avadhi tay kii thi lekin yah maamla bhaawanaaon se is kadar judaa hua he ki isamen samay seemaa tay nahin kii ja sakati
 Opposing Tripathi's plea, the counsel for the Sunni Waqf Board said that the petition has been given with a vested motive and it should not be heard
 unhone kaha ki koi to aisa aadhaar hona chaiye jiske sahare sabhi pakshon ko sweekaarya hal nikaala ja sake lekin yah dukhad he ki yahaan aisa kuch bhi nahin he
 Senior advocate Ravi Shankar Prasad, appearing on behalf of another side of the case, said, "he (tripathi) is a non-serious party who did not reach there regularly during the long hearing before the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court
" Were
 ’ unhone kaha ki is daleel ko bhi nahin sweekaar kiya janaa chaiye ki faisla dene par pratikul parinaam aa sakate hai
 He said, "if this argument about the result is accepted, even a petition filed seeking bail can have negative consequences
" ’ unhone kaha, ‘ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhishon ne koshish kii or maamle ko baatcheet ke jariye hal karne ke liye baar baar prayaas kiye
 The senior counsel said that there is no need to give more time to resolve the matter through out-of-court negotiations
 maamle ke ek or paksh kii ore se pesh hue purv atarni general soli psorabji ne prasad kii daleel se sahmati vyakt karte hue kaha ki nyaayik prakriya parinaam kii bandhak ban kar nahin rah sakati
 The former Prime Minister had also tried to resolve the matter through negotiations but he also failed
 psorabji ne kaha, ‘ham puri tarah maamle kaa samaadhaan nikaale jane ke paksh main hai lekin saath hi is aagrah ke puri tarah khilaaf hai ki maamle kaa faisla taal diya jaye
 The Supreme Court, on the basis of Tripathi's plea, had on September 23 stayed an interim stay for a week after the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict on the Ayodhya ownership dispute on September 24
 haalanki 23 sitambar ko treepathi kii yachika par sunwaayee karne vaali sheersh adaalat kii do sadasyeey peeth ke donon nyaayadhishon nyaayamurti aar ve rabindran or nyaayamurti ech el gokhale kii raay alag alag thi
 Due to differing opinions of the two judges, they issued notice to the parties concerned on Tripathi's plea and handed over the matter to the Chief Justice and requested the formation of a larger bench
 treepathi ne apni yachika main saath saal puraane is maamle kaa hal baatcheet se nikaale kii sambhaavna talashne ke liye samay diye jane or is par faisla taalane kaa aagrah kiya tha

 In the event of CRR increase, banks will have to keep a larger share with the Reserve Bank, and they will have less money to give as loans
 
 
 isi ke vipareet bazaar main nakadi badhaane ke liye rigerv bank siaraar ko ghataya karata he
 
 
 But the important fact is that the change in CRR is done only when the liquidity in the market is not immediately affected by the change in the CRR as compared to the change in the repo rate and reverse repo rate
 Falls into 
 
 siaraar badaye jane kii sthiti main bainkon ko zyaada bada hissaa rigerv bank ke paas rakhana hoga, or unke paas rin ke rup main dene ke liye kam rakam rah jaaegi
 
 
 In contrast, to increase cash in the market, the Reserve Bank deducts the CRR
 
 
 lekin mahatvapurn tathy yah he ki siaraar main badlaav tabhi kiya jaataa he, jab bazaar main nakadi kii taralata par turant asar na daalana ho, kyonki repo rate or reverse repo rate main badlaav kii tulana main siaraar main kiye gaye badlaav se bazaar par asar zyaada samay main padataa he

 On the one hand, while the statement of Digvijay Singh made the Congress gritty, at the same time, by the evening, a statement by Forest Minister Umang Singar has created a storm within the Congress
 dhar main ek kaarykram main shirkat karne pahunche van mantri umang singhar ne congress ke varisht netaa or purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ke khilaaf aisa bayaan diya, jisane bijepi ke us sawaal par muhar laga di he jisamen vah lagaataar congress ke kai gut main bante hone kaa aarope lagaati ai he
 When reporters asked questions related to the letter written by Digvijay Singh to the ministers of Kamal Nath government, Forest Minister Umang Singhar said that the only thing that will be said about Honorable Digvijay Singh is that he is running the government from behind the scenes 
 unhone kaha ki yah baat party ke kaaryakarta se lekar netaa tak sabhi ko pataa he
 Minister Umang Singhar did not stop here, he made another attack on Digvijay Singh, saying that he did not need to write the letter, when the government is running, then why do you need to write the letter? This statement by Minister Umang Singar has created panic in the Congress
 sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya vaaki congress ne 15 saalon tak satta se baahar rahane ke baavjood gutbaji nahin chodi he
 When the BJP targeted the government, when the ministers of the Congress government were attacking the senior leader of the Congress, then how would the main opposition party BJP remain behind
 madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan bijepi ke kai netaaon ne mantri umang singaar ke bayaan ke baad congress par jamkar hallaa bolaa
 BJP said that it has been saying from the beginning that Madhya Pradesh has a government of three chief ministers and this became clear after the statement of the minister
 bijepi ne congress se sawaal poocha ki jab sarkaar parde ke peeche se digvijay singh chalaa rahe hai to phir mukhyamantri kamalnath kya kar rahe hai?shivaraj kaa congress par hamalashivraj singh chouhan ne congress par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki madhya pradesh main abhootpurv sanvaidhanik sankat khadaa ho gaya he
 Kamal Nath is sworn in as the Chief Minister, but Digvijay Singh is running the government
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha ki congress sthiti spasht kare ki madhya pradesh kaa mukhyamantri koun he? kyonki ham to pehle se bol rahe the madhya pradesh main dhai mukhyamantri kii sarkaar he
 Former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan asked CM Kamal Nath that who gave the right to write letters to the ministers of the government to Digvijay Singh? Digvijay Singh is writing a letter to the ministers, asking what are the things done? Shivraj attacked the Congress and said that who has given Digvijay Singh the right to threaten ministers? Shivraj Singh Chauhan has appealed to Congress President Sonia Gandhi to intervene and tell who is the real CM? The high command should decide who should run the government because in Madhya Pradesh, now the officer is also in a fix as to who should listen and who should not listen

 Be careful because according to psychiatrists, if a man is hungry, he is easily attracted towards women with very good breast size
 yahi nahin tikhi shaareerik banaavat vaali mahilaayein bhi bhukhe mard ko apni ore aakarshith karti hai
 According to psychiatrist Viren Swamy of Britain's University of Westminster, if a man has nothing in his stomach, he is attracted to women with relatively large breasts
 unka kahana he ki vaise bhi aadmi aam taur par bade breast sies vaali mahilaon ko pasand karata he
 Not only this, Swami has also said one thing to caution men
 unke anusaar sirf purush hi nahin mahilaayein bhi agar bhukhi hon to ve baari-bharkam purushon kii taraf aakarshith hoti hai
 According to their research, in such a situation, a heavy stomach of any man can attract that woman
 apni is research ko sabit karne ke liye swami ne purushon ke ek samooh ko bhookha rakhaa or unase mahilaon ke aakarshan ke bare main janaa
 They found that men who had not eaten anything for a long time found women with larger breast sizes more attractive
 haalanki unki research main ye baat bhi nikalakar ai ki jaise hi purush kuch kha lete hai mahilaon ke prati unka aakarshan turant khatm ho jaataa he
 Swami states that hunger has a tremendous effect on one's ability to measure attraction

 Janata Dal (U) national president Sharad Yadav said on Monday that the alliance between JD (U) and BJP will continue in the Bihar assembly elections
 yadav ne party karyaalay main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki bihar vidhansabha kaa aagaamee chunaav bhaajapa evam jad (you) milakar ladenge
 He said that the seat sharing has not been considered at the moment but this work will also be completed soon
 jad (you) ke rashtriya adhyaksh se gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke prakaran par prashn poochne par yadav ne kaha, ‘us prakaran ko bhul jaao
 Addressing the meeting of the JD (U) State Working Committee and the workers' conference earlier, Yadav gave instructions to start a movement against inflation
 unhone kaha ki manhagaai se aam naagarik pareshaan he
 The former NDA government had brought relief to the countrymen by controlling inflation, but the present Congress-led government has proved to be a complete failure in curbing inflation
 desh main mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar bhale dilli se chale lekin satta kaa rasta uttar pradesh se hokar gujarata he
 Because PM Modi is a candidate from Banaras seat
 vahiin chahunor mache is chunavi ho-halle ke bich usee banaras kii ek beti dilli main gali-gali bhatak rahi he
 The reason is that there is a danger in his job and he now has the hope of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 varanasi ke saket ilaake kii rahane vaali 28 varshiya khushboo chouhan naam kii yuvati in dinon dilli ke pandit pant maarg par apane doston ke saath dharne par baithi he
 This is the place where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has its state office
 satta ke galiyaaron main khushboo kii kahani sunne kii naa to kisi ko phikr he, naa hi use ye ummid he ki uski samasya kaa chunaavon se pehle koi samaadhaan ho saktaa he, lekin use bas yahi ummid bachi he ki piem modi tak unki aawaaj pahunch jaae
 Khushboo, who is sitting on a dharna with her guest teacher colleagues, is asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, what will the slogan 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' do when the daughter of Raj Mistry of Banaras cannot do the job? Saw an advertisement for a guest teacher and applied
 dilli ke shadipur ke ek skool main counslar ke taur par unka sillection bhi ho gaya or vah vahaan ek kiraye kaa cameraa lekar rahane lageen
 Before she could get full rum in Delhi crowd, she came to know that the job is not confirmed and can go anytime
 khushboo kahati hai ki kareeb 22,000 guest teacheron kaa bhavishya unheen kii tarah adhar main he
 When she left Banaras on March 15, 2018, her entire family and friends came to drop her off at the station
 gharavaalon kii ankhon main khushi ke aansu chhalak uthe ki ek mistre kii beti dilli main jaakar sarkari naukari karegi or ghar ke saare aarthik sankat dur karegi, lekin khushboo kii ye khushi zyada din tik nahin pai
 From March 1 this year, along with all the guest teachers, Khushboo is also staging there
 dilli main bhi chunaav hai or banaras main bhi
 Khushboo is pleading with the PM and MP from his constituency Narendra Modi for himself and all the guest teachers who do not know if there will be a job tomorrow
 khushboo kahatee hai ki unke pita satyanarayan chouhan dihadi mistre kaa kaam karte hai or bade hi mushkil halaat main usko padhaayaa he
 Khushboo is an MA in Psychology and has also done Diploma in Guidance and Counseling
 khushboo kahati hai ki unako itnaa padhaane main unke pita ne qamar tod mehnat kii or kabhi naukari kaa dawaab nahin daalaa
 But when Khushboo thought that it was her turn to help her father, the job seemed to go away
 garibi se nikalakar ek aarthik rup se majboot jindagi jeene or parivaar ko garibi se nikaalane kii unki chaah adhuri rah gai kyonki naa to dilli kii pichhali sarkaar or naa hi abhi kii aam aadmi party sarkaar ne apana vaada nibhaayaa or unki naukari pakki kii
 Now he expects the Prime Minister
 khushboo kahati hai ki unke paas zyada paise nahin bache hai
 You get Rs 30,000 for 20 days of work, but you do not know how many days you will get work, whether you will get work tomorrow or not
 khushboo modi ko banaras se hone kii duhai de rahi hai or apane saathiyon, jinaki haalat bhi lagbhag unheen kii tarah he, ke liye madad maang rahi hai
 Khushboo says that it is absolutely possible to administer guest teachers as it has already happened in Haryana
 bataa den ki dilli ke sarkari skulon main 61168 shikshakon kii jagah he jisamen 34,323 shikshak permanent hai or 21,271 guest teacher hai
 The remaining 5300 posts are vacant

 kabhi ‘captain kool’ or ‘mistar dependable’ ke naam se pahachaane jane vaale mahendra singh dhoni mushkil daur se guzar rahe hai
 Dhoni is facing a lot of criticism for his batting in the World Cup being played in England
 khaas taur par england ke khilaaf dhoni ne jis tarah batting kii, usne unke prashansakon or kai purv cricketrs ko niraash kiya
 Dhoni has been considered one of the best finishers in the cricket world
 pehle jaise dhoni khul kar ran banaate the, uske vipareet ab unhen tezi se ran banane kii koshish main sangharsh karte dekha ja saktaa he
 As soon as India started its mission for the 2019 World Cup, a lot was being said about Dhoni
 dhoni ke naam ke saath sabase lambey samay tak team india ke captain rahane kaa gaurav judaa he
 This is the last chance for 38-year-old wicketkeeper batsman Dhoni to play in the World Cup
 lekin is world cap main ab tak kaa unka pradarshan vaisaa nahin rahaa jaise ki wo ummid rakhte honge
 In the match against Afghanistan, one of the weakest teams in the current World Cup, Dhoni played a dull innings of 28 from 52 balls
 is pari ko lekar bhi unhen kaaphi aalochana sunani padi
 Even master blaster Sachin Tendulkar could not stop himself from saying that Dhoni's innings was very slow and there was no positive approach
 england ke kilaaf match main bhi dhoni par sabhi kii nigahen thim
 But in the entire tournament, India had to face defeat in this match so far
 bharat ko match jeetne ke liye 338 ke score kaa peechha karnaa tha or aakhri 5 over main bharat ko 71 ran kii zarurat thi
 Then there was Dhoni and Kedar Jadhav at the crease
 bharat ke paanch wicket baaki the to bhi match khatm hone par bharat 31 ran se peeche rah gaya
 In place of the best finisher, Dhoni appeared to be struggling to get the ball out of the boundary line and speed up the run
 dhoni 32 gend main 41 ran bana kar note out rahe
 At the same time, Jadhav was not out after scoring 12 runs off 13 balls
 donon aakhri paanch over main 39 ran hi jod sake jisamen unhone 20 single liye or 7 dot gend kheli
 India has played only 7 of its 8 matches in this World Cup, while one match was canceled due to rain
 in 7 maichon main mahendra singh dhoni ne kul 223 ran banaae hai or inkaa ballebaaji ausat 32 ran kaa rahaa he
 The Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) analyzed Dhoni's ODI (ODI International) career data over different years and found how his performance declined at the last stage of his career
 DIU ne dhoni ke kariyar kaa in paimaanon par vishleshan kiya- strike rate (ausat ran prati 100 gend), har boundry (chaukaa yaa chakka) ke liye khele jane vaali ausat gend
 In his career of nearly a decade and a half, Dhoni scored 10,723 runs in 348 matches, with a batting average of 50
 58 rahaa or strike rate 86
 Data shows that in the first 3 years of his career, Doni scored around 100 strike rate
 jaise jaise unka kariyar aage badha unka strike rate gata lekin wo assi kii dahaai main bana rahaa
 However, since 2017, Dhoni's batting strike rate has come down to 80
 ye giravat un maichon main khaas taur par ubhar kar ai jahaan bharat ko lakshya kaa peechha karnaa padaa
 In the matches in which India batted later, since 2017, Dhoni's strike rate has fallen to 71
 dhoni ke naam bharat kii ore se sabase adhik chakke maarane kaa record tha lekin bangladesh ke kilaaf match main rohit sharma ne ye record apane naam kar liya
 Dhoni has 228 sixes and 1071 fours in his name
 in aankadon ko dekhen to dhoni ne phase kii har 12 gend main boundry maari
 This average was better in the early years of his career
 tab ausatan wo phase kii har paanch gend par ek boundry lagaate the
 Dhoni now seems to be struggling to get a boundary and increase the run pace, especially when India are chasing the target
 2017 se baad khele gaye maichon main dhoni ausatan har phase kii 19 gend par ek boundry laga rahe hai
 However, in the matches in which India bat first, Dhoni is putting a boundary on every 9 balls of the average face
 apane golkeeper casper ishmaaical kii behtareen golkiping or yusuf paulsan urari dwaara 59wein minute main gie gaye gol ke dam par denmark ne shanivaar ko moradovia arina main khele gaye fifa world cap 2018 ke group-si ke mukaable main peru ko 1-0 se haraa kar toornament kaa aagaaj jeet ke saath kiya
 The hero of Denmark's victory in this thrilling match was Ishmaikal, who did not allow Peru to equalize with a number of superb saves in the match, especially in the second half, and gave his team three full points
 peru ne pehle half main zyada maukey nahin banaae the, lekin duusare half main uski akraman pankti ne adhiktar samay denmark ke kheme main bitaayaa
 However, his players could not cross the barrier of Ishmaikal
 pehle half main peru ke paas sabase acha or behad aasaan mauka antim samay ke enjuri time main aayaa jab use varshel assitant referi (vieaar) kii madad se penalty mili
 Christian Kveva was taking the ball to the Danish camp
 tabhi paulsan ne unka rasta rokane kii koshish kii
 In this attempt, he dropped Kweva
 referi ne vieaar kaa istemaal kiya or peru ko penalty di
 The responsibility of converting the penalty into a goal was on Queva, but Queva was able to hit the ball high above the bar and the Peruvian players and fans were disappointed
 isse pehle, peru ko match ke 12wein minute main bhi gol karne kaa shandaar mauka mila tha
 Peru's Andre Carillo shot at the goalpost, dodging three Danish defenders, which was blocked by goalkeeper Ishmaikal of the opposition team
 27wein minute main denmark ke thomas delni ne gol karne kaa behtareen prayaas jo antat: vifal rahaa
 His shot, played from 30 yards, went over the bar
 38wein minute main denmark ko free kik jariye gol karne ko ek or kareebi mauka mila
 Even this opportunity was not allowed by the Peruvian defense to cash in on Denmark
 pehle half main donon timen gol karne main vifal raheen
 In the second half, Paulson finally gave Denmark an edge
 59wein minute main christian erikson ne maidan ke bich se gend lee or baayen chor se goalpost kii taraf daud pade
 He was accompanied by Paulson
 mauka pate hi erikson ne pausun ko paas diya or paulsan ne badi safai se gend ko goalpost ke baayen kone main daal denmark ko 1-0 se aage kar diya
 Peru retaliated shortly afterwards
 edison flores ne gend queva ko paas di or vah hadabadi main ek aasaan sa mauka gavaan baithe
 After this Peru got many easy and excellent opportunities, but goalkeeper Ishmaikal stood in his way and kept him away from par

 Suzy was the last contestant to compete in this competition
 jise jajon ne 'brith of fresh air' tak kaha tha, jiskaa matlab he kisi bhi vastu ko dekhakar taazgi kaa ahsaas hona
 According to Suzy, when she first stepped out to compete in Miss Earth Australia (three months ago) in March, she knew that she would not change herself under any circumstances, she would remain the same
 unka maananaa he ki yahi soch unhen jeet kii ore le gai
 The judges used to call me honest and authentic

 She said that i want to inspire women and men with a positive mindset at an age and the words we use to describe ourselves are very powerful
 maine kabhi kaha nahin ki main budhi hoon, main bahut choti hum

 It whipped evms for a few days to console itself
 rajd ne iviem ke khilaaf andolan karne kii ghoshnaa bhi kii, jo hawa main rah gai

 Those who are suspected to have been wrongly admitted through demat include the children of senior leaders of Madhya Pradesh BJP and Congress
 vipaksh ke netaa satyadev kataare kaa aarope he ki pradesh ke panchayat or gramin vikaas mantri gopal bhargav ne beti aakanksha or avantika kaa, ajay vishnoi ne bete abhijit kaa, camel patel ne bhatiji priyanka or indore kii vidhayak malini goud ne karmveer goud kaa daakhila karaayaa
 Katare revealed a few more names, including Health Minister Narottam Mishra, Education Minister Umashankar Gupta, former Minister Prakash Sonkar, Harnam Singh Rathore, Nehru Yuva Kendra's National Vice President Vishnu Dutt Sharma and Peace Committee's Akhilesh Pandey
 is par palatwaar karte hue pradesh ke swasthya mantri or sarkaar ke pravaktaa narottam mishra congress ke un netaaon ke naam bataate hai jinhone apane bacchon yaa rishtedaaron ke daakhile dimet ke jariye karaae
 Mishra said, "katareji does not prove to be passive, so make such baseless allegations
 aarif akil, pisi sharma, gajendra singh rajukhedi, arun yadav, hajaari laal raghuvanshi or tulsi silavat aise congress netaa hai, jinke bacchon ne bhi nijee medical collejon main pravesh liya he
 "similarly, Bhargava argued," The children of ministers and leaders will study somewhere
 dabaav banane ke liye managasaint aarope lagaana galat he
 While Kamal Patel bluntly said, "what should be said if questions arise even on the admission of Gold Medalist children?" That is, the leaders of both parties have left no stone unturned to shape the future of liver pieces in the medical profession through demat
 kaise khulaa ghotalaghotaale kii paraten ughadgaye se pehle yah jaan len ki dimet asal main he kya? jis tarah medical main daakhile ke liye vyapam pre medical test (piemti) kaa aayojan karaata he, usee tarah nijee medical dental or collejon kii management cote kii siton ke liye association for privet medical and dental colejes (apiemdisi) dimet yojit karti he
 If we look at the process of admission of seats in private medical colleges in Madhya Pradesh, then 15% seats in these colleges are filled with NRI quota, 43% demat and 42% seats in state quota
 gadabadi kaa pehla maamla dimet-2006 main saamne aayaa, tab adaalat ne yah pariksha radd kar di thi
 Later the examination was reinstated after a lengthy legal process and people forgot the controversy
 lekin chaar maheene pehle jab vyapam ghotaale kii jaanch ke silsile main gwalior esaity ne atul sharma naam ke dalal ko giraftaar kiya to usne farji tareeke se karaae gaye kai daakhilon kaa zikr kiya
 Of these, Richa Johri had one admission to the 2010 MS course
 richa jabalpur ke mashhoor neurologist dow
 M
 es
 She is the daughter of a jeweler
 maamle ke khulaase ke baad baap-beti ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Sharma said that Nitin Mohindra, the main accused in the Vyapam scam, is more aware of this admission
 jab pehle se jail main band mohindra se poochtacha hui to usne kaha ki yah naam to yogesh kumaar uparit ne uske paas bheja tha
 This person was Vyapam director in 2003-04
 vyapam se ritair hone ke baad usne jabalpur main ek dental college shuru kiya
 Being the director of the Dental College, Uprati easily became a member of APMDC and later the Controller of Demat Examination
 das saal tak is pad par rahete hue usne vyapam ke apane ghotaale ke anubhav ko dimet main udel diya
 On June 3, when the Gwalior SIT arrested Upreet, the 72-year-old Upreet, who was making a fake admission, said, "what are you asking me
" dimet ke saare daakhile hi pehle se tay hote the
 If you have the strength, then put your hands on the gears of the influencers
 ” uparit ne hi un netaaon ke naam ugalane shuru kiye jo baad main congress or bijepi netaaon ne apni-apni rajnatik sahuuliyat ke hisaab se jaahir kiye
 According to a statement of a medical seat of Rs 1 crore, Rs 15 lakh
 se ek karod ru
 Till then admission was taken in Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS), MBBS, MS and MD
 har saal kareeb 1,500 siten nijee medical collejon main dimet ke jariye bhari gayi
 Prior to the Vyapam case, Whistle Blower Anand Rai explains, “in this case Rs 10,000 crore
 kaa len-dein aasaani se hua hoga
 This forgery has been in operation since 2006
 nijee collejon main to adhikansh siten paisa lekar bhari gai hai
 i have been complaining about this for the last three years
 yahaan tak ki hycourt or admician or fees regulatory cameti ne bhi nijee collejon ke khilaaf bolaa lekin na to rajya sarkaar or na hi estf ne is masale par koi karwai kii
 "an official involved in the investigation of the case told on the condition of anonymity," This scam is also like a Vyapam scam
 isamen bhi un logon kii uttar pustika dimet adhikariyon ke jariye bhari gai jinhone isamen paisa diya
 All this was done in association with private colleges
 in parikshaon main bhi dallalon kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn thi
 "there was a scam in Demat by canceling the admission
 It is not a matter that the greed of private colleges was limited only to the demat quota, these colleges were also busy digging the state quota
 kai collejon ne iskaa tarika yah nikaala ki piemti pariksha main paise dekar kuch senior chaatro ko baitha diya
 After passing the PMT, these students enrolled in the state quota seats of these private colleges and after a few days, they dropped their name from the college
 is tarah unki seat mahange daam par bechney ke liye college phir swatantra ho gaye
 Such cases were reported in 50 seats of six private medical colleges in the state
 ek anumaan ke mutabik, nijee collejon ne embibies ke liye 20 se 40 lakh ru
 And one crore for MS-MD
 tak vasule
 From the year 2010 to 2013, out of 1,450 seats in private medical colleges, 721 seats were canceled by the state quota admission and sold these seats at arbitrary prices
 enarai siton kii boli alagadimet or state cote ke baad bachaa pravasi bhartiya yani enarai kota
 Admissions to NRI seats were to be given to the sons-daughters of nris or their close relatives
 lekin isamen desh ke chaatro ko moti rakam lekar bina piemti or dimet die admician diya gaya
 From those coming from private college Vyapam and Demat exams where Rs 15 lakh to 30 lakh
 lete the vahi enarai seat par unhone 1-1 karod ru
 Taking admission
 isamen piemti or dimet dene kii jarurat hi nahin thi
 After the fraud was exposed, there is now a demand that the demat examination be scrapped
 21 june ko dimet pariksha kaa aayojan kiya janaa he
 People like Opposition leader Satyadev Katare as well as people like Anand Rai are demanding that it be repealed
 raay ne is maang ko lekar supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya he
 Although people like Upriat have reached jail in old age, but still waiting for those arrests, at whose behest people like Upriat and Nitin Monhidra are burning the scam

 This Lok Sabha election is historical in many ways
 is chunaav ke dauraan nehru-gandhi parivaar kii sabase nai sadsy priyanka gandhi ne bhi raajnneeti main kadam rakhe lekin siyaasi galiyare main unke is aakasmik aagaman kaa koi laabh nahin mila
 Priyanka Gandhi took the front just three months before the start of elections, which has not seen any significant impact
 is loksabhaa chunaav main puure prachaar ke dauraan priyanka gandhi ne 38 reliyaan kin
 Of these, 26 rallies were held only in UP, the rest campaigning for Congress candidates in Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Jharkhand and Haryana
 priyanka gandhi ne jitani siton par prachaar kiya tha, unamem se 97 fisadi siten congress haar gai
 Priyanka Gandhi was made in charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, along with Jyotiraditya Scindia was made in charge of western Uttar Pradesh
 donon ko party main mahasachiv kaa pad diya gaya tha
 Uttar Pradesh had a triangular contest
 ek taraf majboot bijepi gathbandhan tha, duusari taraf sapa basapa kaa mahagathbandhan tha
 In the presence of these two, the challenge before Priyanka Gandhi was to bring back the lost base of Congress
 uttar pradesh main priyanka gandhi ko utaarne ko kuch logon ne 'masterstroke' bataaya tha to kuch kaa kahana tha ki congress kaa yah faisla hadabadi main liya gaya he
 Uttar Pradesh has always been at the center of Indian politics
 mana jaataa he ki dilli kaa rasta uttar pradesh se hokar jaataa he
 In terms of representation, it is the largest state in the country where 80 of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha are held
 purvi uttar pradesh main loksabhaa kii 41 siten hai
 Many VIP seats of the state are also included in this area, such as Varanasi seat of Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Gorakhpur seat of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Amethi and Rae Bareli seat of Gandhi Nehru family etc
 ab jab loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aa chuke hai, yah spasht he ki rajya ke matadaataaon par priyanka gandhi kaa jaadu nahin chalaa
 The bjp-led coalition has won a landslide victory
 raat 10 baje tak endie ko 340 se zyada siten milti dikh rahi hai, jabaki congress kii aguwai vaale upie ko maatr 92 siton par santosh karnaa padaa
 Congress performed poorly in Uttar Pradesh
 nehru gandhi parivaar ke sabase majboot kilon main ek ko dhaha dene main bijepi kaamyaab rahi
 The Congress president is seen losing his traditional seat Amethi
 ve bhaajapa kii smriti irani se raat 10 baje tak kareeb 50 hajaar voton se peeche chal rahe hai
 However, Sonia Gandhi managed to save her stronghold Rae Bareli
 congress ko puure pradesh se yahi ekmaatr seat hasil ho saki he
 On the other hand, NDA is leading in 61 seats till 10 pm, performing brilliantly
 sapa or basapa ke mahagathbandhan ko milakar 18 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 The Congress contested 67 seats in the entire state, leaving the remaining few seats to allies
 india today or exis maai india ke eczit pole ke mutabik, congress puure pradesh main matadaataaon par koi asar daal paane main naakaam rahi
 On the other hand, the Mahagathbandhan was supported by the Muslim and Yadav voters, but the NDA managed to garner Jat, non-dalit and upper caste votes
 isse pehle 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi congress maatr do siten hi jeet saki thi, amethi or raibareli
 While BJP got 73 seats in the entire state
 yahaan tak ki 2017 main hue rajya ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi congress ne sapa ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa tha or is gathbandhan ko 403 main se maatr 54 siten hasil hui thim

 Gujarat Assembly elections are held in December, in which a list of 40 leaders has been released for campaigning
 ab chunaav prachaar main narendra modi kaa muqabla karenge rahul gandhi
 Till now, Congress had kept silence about Rahul Gandhi campaigning in Gujarat Assembly elections but now it has become clear that Rahul Gandhi will go to Gujarat to campaign
 ab gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan rahul gandhi or narendra modi ke bich bhaashanon or bayanon main muqabla ho saktaa he
 It will be interesting to see how Rahul Gandhi will express his opinion about Narendra Modi by visiting Gujarat
 rahul gandhi ke liye chunauti badi isliye bhi he kyonki mana ja rahaa he ki modi teesri baar bhi gujarat kaa chunavi kila fatah kar sakate hai

 centre kii sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan sarkaar se uski ek pramukh sahyogi rashtravaadi congress party kii naaraazgi kii atakalon ke bich donon ne kaha he ki ve ab bhi saath bane hue hai
 There are some issues, but they will be resolved
 sarkaar se naaraaz chal rahi rakanpa ke adhyaksh sharad pavaar ko manaate hue pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne jahaan unhen centre sarkaar ke liye 'mahaan smapda' bataaya, vahiin rakanpa ne saaf kiya ki na to pavaar or na hi sarkaar main shaamil iske ek anya mantri prafull patel ne kendriya mantrimandal se istipha diya he
 After a meeting of NCP leaders for nearly two hours on Friday, party leader and Union Heavy Industries Minister Patel also dismissed reports of resentment for not getting the position of number two in a conversation with reporters
 unhone spasht kiya ki rakanpa kii naaraazgi sarkaar ke sanchaalan ke tareekon ko lekar he or is bare main pradhanmantri manmohan singh tathaa samprag va congress kii adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko avgat kara diya gaya he
 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, celebrating Pawar, said on Friday, "he is an extremely valuable ally, whose knowledge, intelligence and experience are extremely important for our government
" " At the same time, Patel rejected the speculation of Pawar's resignation from the Union Cabinet, there is no question of his separation from the government
 tarik anwar va deepi treepathi sahit rakanpa ke anya netaaon kii kareeb do ghante tak chali baithak ke baad patel ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "is samay tak hamane aupchaarik rup se istife nahin die hai
 
 iskaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 And then the issue is not even about resignation
 " Earlier, Pawar met Congress President Sonia Gandhi at his 10 Janpath residence for about 30 minutes
 soochon ke anusaar, aisa lagata he ki sonia naaraaz chal rahe pavaar ko samajhane-bujhane main kaamyaab rahi
 There were signs of crisis in the UPA when Pawar and Patel did not reach the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday
 atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim ki sarkaar main pavaar ko nambar do kii sthiti nahin milane ke kaaran rakanpa ke ukt donon netaaon ne mantrimandal se istipha de diya he
 But Patel on Friday termed such speculation as 'rubbish', saying that 'some sections of Congress' are 'wrongly' raising such things and in the media they are being ridiculed in the name of 'sources'
 vahiin, congress ke media vibhaag ke adhyaksh janardan dvivedi is par tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 He said, "we do not comment on our coalition partners
 "tippaniyan Patel also said that it disagreed with the government on some issues long back, but it was not upheld before the presidential election
 unhone kaha, "hamane shanivaar ko shaam paanch baje matdaan samaapt hone ke baad hi apana sandesh bhejne kaa faisla kiya
 " patel ne kaha ki rakanpa chaahati he ki sarkaar varsh 2014 main hone vaale aam chunaav kii taiyaari kare
 He said, "NCP is the most responsible ally of the government for the last eight years and it is a pillar of its strength
 ham mahasoos karte hai ki agle do saal main aam chunaav hone vaale hai
 In such a situation, the government should be more decisive and more committed to the issues before the people
 " While celebrating NCP President Sharad Pawar, who was angry with the government, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described him as a 'great asset' for the central government, while NCP made it clear that neither Pawar nor its other minister in the government Praful Patel Has resigned from the Union Cabinet
 rakanpa ke netaaon kii shuukravaar ko kareeb do ghante tak chali baithak ke baad party ke netaa va kendriya baari udyog mantri patel ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main nambar do kii sthiti nahin milane ke kaaran naaraazgi kii khabaron ko bhi khaarij kiya
 He made it clear that ncp's resentment is about the way the government operates and this has been conveyed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA and Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 is bich, pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne pavaar ko manaate hue shuukravaar ko kaha, "vah behad moolyawaan sahyogi hai, jinaki jaankaree, buddhi tathaa anubhav hamaari sarkaar ke liye behad mahatvapurn hai
 " vahiin, patel ne kendriya mantrimandal se pavaar ke istife kii atakalon ko khaarij karte hue sarkaar se alag hone kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 After a nearly two-hour meeting of other NCP leaders, including Tariq Anwar and DP Tripathi, Patel told reporters, "till now we have not formally resigned
 
 Its question does not arise
 or phir mudda istife kaa he bhi nahin
 " isse pehle pavaar kii kareeb 30 minute tak congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se unke 10 janpath sthit awaas par mulaakaat hui thi
 According to the lists, it seems that Sonia managed to persuade the angry Pawar
 samprag main sankat ke sanket tab mili the jab pavaar or patel guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii adhyakshata main hui mantrimandal kii baithak main nahin pahunche
 There was speculation that the two NCP leaders resigned from the cabinet due to Pawar not getting number two position in the government
 lekin patel ne shuukravaar ko aisi atakalon ko 'bakawaas' qaraar dete hue kaha ki 'congress ke kuch varg hi' 'galat tareeke' se aisi baaten uthaa rahe hai or media main unhen 'sutron' ke naam par uchhaala ja rahaa he
 At the same time, Janardan Dwivedi, president of the Congress's media department, declined to comment on this
 unhone kaha, "ham apane gathbandhan sahyogiyon par tippanee nahin karte
 "comments patel ne yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar ke saath kuch muddon par isaki asahmati bahut pehle se he, lekin ise raashtrapati chunaav se pehle nahin uchhaala gaya
 He said, "we decided to send our message only after the voting ends at 5 pm on Saturday
 " Patel said that the NCP wants the government to prepare for the 2014 general elections
 unhone kaha, "rakanpa pichley aath saal se sarkaar kii sabase adhik jimmedaar sahyogi he or yah isaki majbootee kaa ek stambh he
 We feel that general elections are going to be held in the next two years
 aise main sarkaar ko logon ke samaksh adhik nirnayaatmak or logon ke samaksh muddon ke saath adhik patibaddhta ke saath pesh hona chahie

 The Prime Minister said that India is considered iron in the whole world today
 bharat ne apni sarthak nitiyon or santulit vyavhaar se duniya main apni yah jagah banaai he
 Prime Minister Modi said that the most important change in New India and New World Order has been that now India has abandoned the strategy of keeping everyone happy
 pradhanmantri ne daawa kiya ki ab new india kii nitiyaan kahati hai ki jarurat padane par bharat na to philistin jane se hichkegaa or na hi use israel jane se koi gurej rahegaa

 There is only one reason behind this, that 1
25 billion citizens of the country are standing behind me
 piem modi ne kaha ki unhen bharosa he ki vah duniya ko bharat kaa satya samajhane main safal honge
 Referring to the tour of England, Modi said that Prince Charles came to India by personally inviting me, he wrote me a letter in private
 bharat ne apane vyavhaar ke dwaara kisi bhi bhedbhaav ke bina, duniya ke kisi bhi desh ke saath bharat ne na kisi ke saath aankh jhukaakar baat kii or na kisi ke saath aankh uthaakar kii, balki aankh milakar baat kii
 Due to this, today India has emerged as a global leader and in this role India is moving forward with a new belief

 By the way, Sachin Tendulkar has the greatest experience of carrying this pressure and responsibility, and for the last 24 years he has been taking it very well without any wrinkles, but now in his last innings, not only his loved, but very knowledgeable They are also expecting some 'superman' feats
 
 
 vaise, yah bhi tay he ki sachin tendulkar in chaar pariyon main kuch bhi karen, cricket jagat main unka kad hameshaa ooncha hi rahegaa
 
 
 Remember, none of Sir Don Bradman, Sir Vivian Richards, Ricky Ponting, Alan Border, Javed Miandad, inzamam-ul-haq, Sir Gary Sobers are remembered for their last innings, but Sachin Tendulkar's many innings went well
 Will always be remembered as innings

 But it is rarely discussed that just one Test match before that he scored an unbeaten 173 runs at Leeds in his 51st Test match

 Sunil Gavaskar played his last Test match against Pakistan in Bengaluru, in which he missed out on just four runs to complete his 35th Test century, but before that he had scored 63 runs in his 124th Test match

 The memories of the departure of former Australian captain Steve Waugh in 2004 are still fresh today
 
 
 steve wa ne apni aakhri do pariyon main 40 or 80 ran banaae the or unhen yaadgaar bana diya
 
 
 It is a coincidence that Sachin Tendulkar also played an unbeaten innings of 241 runs in the same Test match played in Sydney, which many experts consider to be unmatched
 
 
 pichley dhai dashak se sachin tendulkar ke prashansak unase 'or zyada' kii khwaahish karte gaye or vah apane phans kii pyaas bujhaate or badhaate rahe
 
 
 Now in the last 199th and 200th Test matches of his career, played at Eden Gardens and Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, Sachin's fans are expecting him like 'superman', and are constantly hearing 'yeh Dil Maange More'

 In the Saradha scam case, the Supreme Court will decide on Wednesday whether Rajiv Kumar, the former Kolkata Police Commissioner, be given CBI custody
 supreme court ne sibiai se kaha ki agar aap yah sabit kar dete hai ki rajeev kumaar ne jaanch main sahyog nahin kiya to ham giraftaar ke aadesh de denge
 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, on behalf of the CBI, during the hearing in the Supreme Court on Tuesday in the case of former Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar, argued that the West Bengal Police received cds and other strong evidence from the accused arrested in Jammu and Kashmir in the Saradha chit fund case Were
 magar kolkata police ne ab tak SIT ko wo saboot nahin die
 He said that the CBI should have given all the evidence honestly
 solicytor general tushaar mehta ne aage kaha ki is ghotaale kaa khulaasa karne or iske peeche ke asli aparaadhiyon tak pahunchane ke liye ye sabase zyaada zaruri saboot hai
 Rajiv Kumar has taken the undue advantage of giving protection from the arrest of the Supreme Court
 rajeev kumaar sabooton ko nasht karne main shaamil rahe hai
 Until Rajiv Kumar is detained and questioned, the truth will not be revealed
 hamen chaar saal tak kai baar request karne ke baad sidiaar di gai
 That too is half incomplete
 is puure prakaran main istemaal teen ahm mobile nambaron kii kol detail bhi puri nahin he
 He further argued that the police also has a CDR of 6 more mobile numbers in the Vidhannagar area
 vodaphone ne jaanch ke dauraan puure saal bhar kii kol detail kii sari jaankaree bengal police or prashasan ko de rakhi he
 But the Bengal Police is not even sharing that information
 iske baad chif justise ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki jab castodial interogeshan (nyaayik hiraasat main poochtacha) itnaa zaruri he to aap sidhe-sidhe is manshaa kii yachika daayar karen or us par hi daleelein den
 There is no point in talking past
 supreme court ne sibiai ko kaha ki aap sabit karen ki kolkata police kamishnar ne jaanch main sahyog nahin kiya
 If this is proved then we will order the arrest of Rajiv Kumar
 sibiai ne supreme court se apane us aadesh ko waapas lene kii maang kii he, jisamen kolkata ke purv kamishnar rajeev kumaar ko giraftaar naa karne yaa kathor karrwai naa karne ko kaha he
 However, on the plea of CBI, former Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar has filed an answer in the Supreme Court
 halafname main rajeev kumaar ne kaha he ki BJP netaaon mukul roy or kailash vijayawargeey ke kehane par karrwai ho rahi he
 Rajiv Kumar has also submitted an audio clip in court to support his claim
 darasal, CBI ne rajeev par sharada chitlent cese ke saboot mitaane kaa aarope lagaate hue giraftaar kii maang kii he

 But today i was prevented from going to the mall because i was wearing a dhoti
 sawaal kiye jane par mujhe bataaya gaya ki suraksha kaarnon celungi or dhotimein pravesh se roka gaya
 In the end, i was allowed inside because i could plead in English '
 avikuntak ne kaha,‘mujhe is ghatana ke bare main kya kahana he? kripaya mere fasebuk post ko dekhie jahaan puure ghatnakram kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 The mall administration denied the charge and said that the security personnel at the gate asked them to wait and then went to seek the opinion of the supervisor

 He also said that if the Patnaik government had taken appropriate steps, the state's economic situation would not have been pathetic

 In Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP has formed a government with the PDP, whose stance on Article 370 is completely opposite to the bjp's, but in the important meeting going on in Nagpur, the RSS has made it clear that it will not change its stand on the issue of Section 370, But at present, it is talking about keeping the matter in the same way as the BJP
 sangh ke sanyukt mahasachiv dattatreya hosaable ne sangh ke sheersh nikaay kii teen divasiy baithak ke pehle din kaha, anuchhed 370 par sangh kaa rukh badla nahin he, ham is mudde par kabhi samjhauta nahin karenge
 We want to improve the situation
 yadi sthiti main sudhaar nahin hota he to ham nirnay lenge

 sawaal yah bhi he ki apni-apni rajnatik mahatvakankshaon ke chalate hue ye gathbandhan kya paanch saal paaegaa? ye sawaal isliye khadaa hua he kyonki bijepi ne bhale hi sarkaar banane ke chalate dhara 370 kaa mudda kinare kar diya ho, lekin aresas is mudde par koi samjhauta karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 But will the BJP jeopardize the future of its own coalition government on this issue? In the Common Minimum Program of the current government, it is clearly written that the two parties have different opinions on the special status of Kashmir, so the issue will remain in cold storage
 aresas bhale hi dhara 370 ke mudde par apana sakht rukh barkaraar rakhane kii baat kar rahaa ho lekin vah ye bhi chahta he ki bijepi main kashmir main is sarkaar ko kaayam rakhe kyonki ye ek nae tareeke kaa prayog he

 loksabhaa chunaav ke paanchaven charan ke prachaar ke antim din amethi ke liye ravaanaa hone se pehle congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne dilli main press conference ke jariye chunaav ayog kii vishsaneeyata par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki ayog satta paksh kii tulana main vipaksh par zyada sakht he
 Whatever the Election Commission may do, the public has made up its mind
 rahul gandhi ne chunaav ayog ke ravaiye par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki vipaksh par chunaav ayog behad sakhti se pesh aa rahaa he
 When it comes to BJP, it takes a stand, but when it comes to opposition parties, the Election Commission becomes completely biased there
 unhone aage kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi, bijepi or aresas kaa kaam karne kaa tarika sansthaanon ko pakadakar kaam karnaa he
 The Congress president said that the same is visible everywhere from the Supreme Court to the RBI and the Election Commission
 yahi unki koshish he
 We are aware that it is also having an impact on the Election Commission
 chunaav ayog jo bhi kar le, hindustan kii janata ne man bana liya he, to koi kuch nahin kar saktaa
 But the responsibility of the Commission should be performed honestly
 unhone kaha ki ham kabhi bhi sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ko vyavastha ko disturb karne nahin denge
 The matter reached the court During the Lok Sabha election campaign, the model code of conduct is being violated by both the ruling party and the opposition, and both the parties are also filing complaints against each other in the Election Commission
 narendra modi or amit shah ke khilaaf adarsh aachaar samhita ke kathith ulanghan ke sambandh main congress kii 11 main se 2 shikayaton par faisla kiya ja chukaa he
 The Election Commission has given a clean chit to PM Modi for his speeches
 isse pehle supreme court ne chunaav ayog ko pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii ore se kathith taur par nafrat failaane vaale bayanon yaa adarsh aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan karne ke maamle main congress kii shesh bachi 9 shikayaton par nirnay lene ke nirdesh die
 The court will hear the case on 6 May
 chunaav ayog mukhyamantri yogi adityanath, mayawati, ajam khan, pragna thakur samet kai netaaon par unke vivaadit bol ke kaaran pratibandh laga chukaa he
 However, many parties, including the Congress, are accusing the Election Commission of 'inaction' on complaints against the top leadership of the BJP
 congress kii saansad sushmita dev ne supreme court main daayar yachika main aarope lagaaya he ki bijepi netaa pichley chaar hafte se lagaataar adarsh aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kar rahaa he or chunaav ayog ne congress kii 40 shikayaton par koi nirnay nahin liya
 Rahul Gandhi made it clear in his PC that why he apologized to the Supreme Court on the statement 'chowkidar Chor Hai'
 unhone kaha, 'maine supreme court se maafee maangi he, kyonki vahaan sunwaayee chal rahi he or maine is par coment kar diya, jabaki wo meri jagah nahin thi
 i apologized if i made a mistake, but 'the watchman is a thief', this is the truth
 isliye na main narendra modi se or na hi bijepi se maafee nahin maang rahaa hum
 This slogan will continue

 But at 8 o'clock in the night the speaker postponed the house till Monday

 All eyes on Governor Vajubhai: Political analysts believe that the way the proceedings in the state assembly have been going on for the last 2 days, it is clear that both the Congress and the JDS do not want to vote on the confidence vote yet and this will be done by next week
