 The party has condemned the incident and accused Kejriwal of being the bjp's hand behind the repeated attacks
 arvind kejariwal ne ravivaar ko press conference karke kaha ki pichley paanch saalon main mujh par nau hamale kiye gaye
 Kejriwal said that the attack has not been on me but on the people of Delhi, if i am attacked, the responsibility of the BJP government is
 ye kehete hue kejariwal pradhanmantri narendra modi se istipha bhi maanga he
 The country is raising the voice against the dictatorship of PM Modi
 Voice Kejriwal said that the wife of the attacker said that her husband cannot hear anything against Modi ji
 isliye yah hamalaa karavaaya gaya he jisase modi ke khilaaf bolne vaale dar jaaen
 Kejriwal said that an attempt is being made to send a message through this attacker that those who speak against Modi will not be released
 yah ek taanashaah ke lakshan hai, lekin main darane vaale nahin hum
 i am happy that the people of the country are also raising their voice
 kejariwal ne kaha ki desh ke kai netaaon ne is hamale ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai he
 The country is raising its voice against the dictatorship of PM Modi
 jaan ganvaakar bhi nahin chukaa saktaa janata kaa ahasaanakejariwal ne kaha ki hamalaa isliye karavaaya gaya kyonki inako hamaare kaam karne se dikkat he
 They are scared of the work we have done in electricity, water, education and health
 jis tarah se hamaara kaam aage bad rahaa he, in partiyon kaa janaadhar khisak rahaa he, jo ye bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai

 Do Modi and Amit Shah want to assassinate Kejriwal now? Having put in all the strength for 5 years, whose morale could not be broken, he could not be defeated in the elections
 
 Now you want to get him out of the way like this, Cairo! This is your time Kejriwal

 On one hand, the Aam Aadmi Party has called it a conspiracy, while the police said that according to the attacker Suresh, he was upset with the behavior of the party leaders
 It’s appalling that the Delhi Police knew of the impending attack on the CM and it did not try to stop it
 Clear that it's a conspiracy and is being controlled from the top
 cms security is the job of Delhi Police and they are under oath to ensure it
 Then why this callousness? Https: / / t

 He tweeted and said, the security of the Chief Minister of Delhi is under the Modi government, but Kejriwal's life is most vulnerable
 unhone kaha ki baar-baar hamalaa or phir police kaa ronaa, kya saazish he iske peeche? himmat he to saamne aakar waar karo dusron ko hathiyaar banaakar nahin

 mere param mitra narbhasalal is baat ko lekar puri tarah se aashwast the ki unki yogyata desh ke kaam tabhi aegi jab vah siyasat main hissedaar honge
 After much deliberation, he finally became a member of the BJP
 is khushi ko baantne ke liye mithai lekar vah mere ghar padhaare
 There is a lot of good news in my mouth that says Laddoo
 maine poocha ki bete kaa pramotion ho gaya kya? vah bole, ‘nahin yaar vah jis company main kaam karata tha vahaan staff kii chantni ho rahi thi, so kal hi vahaan se bhaga diya gaya’
 So the daughter's marriage must have been decided? Some teasingly said, 'no man
 koi rojgaar vaala yogyavar mili tab na shaadi tay karun
 'well i asked, what is the good news? Narbhaslal said in a tweet, 'dude, i have got BJP membership'
 maine badhai dete hue puch liya ki yaar tum bhaajapa ke sadsy hi kyon bane, kisi duusari party ke kyon nahin bane? bas meraa itnaa poochna tha ki narbhasalal chaalu ho gaye
 He started telling or rather that his narrative is like this
 ‘bhaajapa desh hi nahin duniyaan kaa sabase bada raajnneetik dal he
 Patna's Golghar is not even bigger than that
 chaudaa itnaa kii four line-sicks line sadak bhi munhe takate rah jaae
 Tall so long that the father, the big-speed train also looks small in front of it
 party main ek se ek badkaa netaa sab he
 The whole system is like the smallest ninety-nine hands in Lanka
 jiskaa koi naamo nahin suna he vah mantari-santari isi party main ban saktaa he
 So we also have a full chance here that some big post will meet
 doosraa jo sabase inmportent baat he, jo mujhe bhaajapa kii taraf khinch le gaya vah he iske paas duusari party ke netaaon ko gariyaane kaa kubbat
 Now what was the benefit of going to Congress? vahaan chalaa jaataa to bhaajapa ke kis netaa ko gariyaata?yahaan to jamaa-jamaa do-chaar netaa hi he wo bhi gariyaane laayak nahin he
 Vajpayee, Advani or Joshi are the only lenders
 lekin sach bataaun, congressi bhi inhe gariyana nahi chaahate hai
 Vajpayee is no more, but both the leaders are such that he has been pushed into the party without being arrested
 inhen gaali dekar kya phayda?lekin bhaajapa main rahete hue ham congress ke tamaam bade netaaon ko jam kar gariyaa sakate hai
 Whether it is Nehru or Indira or Rajiv or Sonis, all are worthy of garrison
 rahul to is laayak bhi nahin he ki use gariyaa saken
 Yes, sometimes when no one is found, he can also be told by confessing
 teesraa baat yah he jis vajah se main bhaajapa kaa sadsy bana vah he iskaa aadhunik technalaji kaa istemaal karnaa
 Just two more missed members
 na party daftar jane kii jarur na hi kisi ke aag-peeche ghumne kii majaburi
 Miss Miss Call in shock and become a member
 apana phone nahin bhi ho to bhi kisi duusare ke phone se miss kaal dekar sadsy bana ja saktaa he
 Due to this facility, today it is also possible that in many states, the party does not even get as many votes as the members
 chauthaa jo sabase bada kaaran he vah he is party kii sadsy bananaa ganga snaan karne jaisaa punya kaa kaam he
 Did not come here but all the old sins were washed away
 dekha nahin bengal vaala vah netaa jo pehle tiemasi main tha
 He was accused of corruption, if he had stayed in TMC for a few days, he would have gone to jail
 lekin bhaajapa main aate hi ekadam pavitra ho gaya
 Here, one thing is necessary to tell that Chidambaram, after studying abroad, dipped his father's money
 bhaajapa main chalaa jaataa to batch jaataa
 Now he is languishing in jail in Congress
 isi ko kehete hai buddhi kaa istemaal nahin karnaa
 And that Karnataka Bala is some Shiva, he has also reached the right place
 bhaajapa main aa jate to mantri to baniye jaataa na budabak’
 Well i intermittently asked that good Narbhaslal, tell me why the Samajwadi Party, RJD or Left parties should not think of going here? Narbhaslal erupted
 bole, ‘ham tumko kshetreey dal ke laayak lagate hai kya ji
 Our stature is from National Politics
 vaise bhi samaajawaadee party ke cycle par aaj ke jamaane main koun chadhega, jab desh main bullate train chalane vaala he
 By the way, i also thought of going left
 vahaan to lagbhag pahunch bhi gaya tha lekin landing main gadabad ho gaya
 As Chandrayaan continued to reach the moon, i remained as a leftist
 darasal vahaan jane se pehle bhagwaan kaa prarthana karne chalaa gaya tha or maathe par tilak lagaakar haath main prasad lekar unke daftar chalaa gaya to vahaan ke logon ne mujhe dhakiya kar laga diya
 The Left is useless anyway
 vah us machhar jaise hai jo raat ko sote vakt kaan ke paas aawaaj karte hue udata he lekin katata nahin he
 Yes, it is true that the cutting party belongs to Mamata Banerjee but the poor are scared
 so kul mila kar ek hi party bachaa bhaajapa, so ham ho gaye hai bhaajapai

 In parallel to the questions raised in Caravan magazine about the procedures following the death of CBI Special Judge Brijgopal Harimohan Loya, the Indian Express report has come out
 kuch jagahon par express kii report kairavaan kii report ko katati he to kuch jagahon par express kii report ko lekar hi nae andeh khadey ho jate hai
 It would have been better if the Supreme Court had taken cognizance of this matter and formed an inquiry committee that would first instill confidence in the family and family of Judge Loya towards the system and society
 parivaar ke logon ko hi saamne aakar yah jokhim uthaanaa hoga kyonki baat unheen se shuru hui thi
 Caravan magazine has not said anything on the Express report
 haal hi main rajesh or nupur talwaar kaa maamla ho yaa reyaan skool ke bas conductor ashok kaa maamla he, iskaa sabak ye he ki media trial se bachaa janaa chahie
 Since i have reported for the first time on the caravan, i should once again summarize the report of the Express
 mere prime time kaa uddeshy yahi tha ki apni baat kehane se kisi ko darana nahin chahie
 Indian Express has also not been successful in talking to family members
 isliye zaruri he ki aisi jaanch samiti bane jiske saamne jane main parivaar ko bharosa ho or media trial band ho
 Questions have arisen related to which the documents and questions should be kept before the committee or else there will be a debate on TV about each evidence, then the same evidence will be considered correct and sometimes false
 kairavaan kii pehali report 21 november ko ai he, indian express kii 27 november ko
 After six days of discussion, if the family is unable to muster the courage to speak openly, then it is a matter of concern
 kya ve dare hue hai yaa parivaar ke bheetar koi baat he
 Those who have gone through the activities of investigative agencies, lengthy legal processes, they know the consequences of going to that side
 isliye unka bhay samajha ja saktaa he
 But they should know that among them all common people fight the system and also get justice
 kairavaan ke niranjan taakale ne likhaa he ki jaj loya kii maut ke 80 dinon baad jaanch kii maang kii thi, 18 farvari 2015 ko lekar manzur nahin hui
 It was not that the family broke the silence after three years, it is still silent, unable to muster the courage to speak
 jaj loya kii patni or bete ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se baat nahin kii, likhaa he ki unhen jaan kaa dar he
 The mother-son also did not talk to Vivek Deshpande and Maurya Janwalkar of Express
 agar maa bete kisi dar se baat nahin kar rahe hai to yah chintaa kii baat he
 Niranjan Takle of Caravan magazine met Judge Loya's father Harikishan Loya in November 2016
 tab unhone kaha tha ki 85 saal kaa ho chukaa hum, maut kaa dar nahin, magar bacchiyon or unke bacchon kii jaan kii phikr he
 Express has written that Harikishan Loya, Anuradha Biyani, Sarita Mandhane's phone switch off, they could not be found even at home
 yani jin logon ne kairavaan ke reporter se baat kii un logon se express ke reporter sampark nahin kar sake
 Not found at home anuraadhaa biyani ne video bayaan diya he or is cese main vahi ekmaatr on record bayaan he
 Caravan's report is based on the statements of sister Anuradha Biyani, Sarita Manadhane and father Harikishan
 express ne shrinivas loya, harikishan loya ke bhai, justise loya ke chachaa se baat kii he jo kehete hai ki unki bhatiji anuraadhaa ne jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai wo kaaphi ahm hai
 Uncle Srinivas Loya also spoke to NDTV, saying that he was told that the post-mortem had been done and the dead body was kept in the box and sent from Nagpur
 ham shav kaa intazaar kar rahe the or jab pahunchaa to ambulance kaa driver hi tha or koi nahin tha
 This is what Anuradha Biyani has said
 kairavaan or express kii report me postmortem ke baad shav lene ke liye jis vyakti ne hastakshar kiye hai unka naam dow
 Prashant is Rathi
 prashanth rathi ne camere par baat karne se inkaar kar diya he, unase enditivi ke maanas or saurav gupta ne sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 There is a big difference in what Prashant Rathi said to Manas and what he told the Express
 prashanth ne enditivi ke maanas se kaha ki mere ankal ne subah chah baje ke kareeb jaj loya kii maut kii soochna di or main shok ke samay main parivaar kii sahaayta ke liye turant pahunchaa
 Dr
 Prashant Rathi told Manas that he lives in Uncle Aurangabad and is the cousin of Judge Loya
 rathi ne maanas ko rishta nahin bataaya ki mausa hai, angrezi kaa ankal or kazin istamaal kiya
 The name was not even told who it was
 yahi rathi express se baat karte hai to saaf-saaf kehete hai ki mausa kaa phone aayaa or unka naam rukmesh pannalaal jakotia he
 He gets a call that his cousin Judge Loya is admitted to the Meditrina Hospital and asks me to help Loya
 jab main aspataal pahunchataa hum to doctor bataate hai ki unki maut ho chuki he
 i tell this to my uncle
 ankal mujhe aupchaariktaaon kaa dhyaan rakhane ke liye kehete hai
 Now you see that Prashant Rathi tells a reporter that Uncle's phone call that Loya has died at 6 o'clock
 ek reporter se kehete hai ki loya bhartee hai, unki madad karen
 Going to the hospital, he learns that Loya is dead
 yahaan ek or sawaal he
 In Nagpur, Dr
 Prashant Rathi was the only one managing all, so did someone close to Loya's family repeatedly talk to him, to know what is going on, where the body will be taken
 kya doctor rathi bataa sakate hai ki unase parivaar ke kisne kaha ki shav mumbai nahin, latur se sata gaategaanv jayega
 Dr
 Prashant Rathi refused to speak on camera
 yah saaf nahin he ki rathi ke mausa jakotia jaj loya ke kitne kareebi the, kya ve pita se baat kar rahe the, kya anuraadhaa biyani se baat kar rahe the? dow prashanth rathi ne enditivi ke maanas ko bataaya ki unhone jaj loya ke shav ko nahin dekha tha
 They were wrapped in a sheet
 bas unhone sin kar diya
 In Caravan's report, sister Anuradha Biyani talks about a relative in Nagpur but does not mention the name
 unki baatcheet main rukmesh pannalaal jakotia kaa koi zikr nahin he, na hi jaj loya ke pita ne naam liya he
 Prashant Rathi, signing the post-mortem report, described himself as the cousin of the deceased
 pita ke said se
 But his warts call Judge Loya his brother
 mausa kaa bhai to mausa ke baraabar hua
 So how did Rathi tell herself Loya's cousin
 agar main sahi hum to rathi loya or jakotia ke bhatija lagenge
 Was Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia in touch with Judge Loya's wife, father and sister Anuradha
 express kii report se saaf nahin hota he ki shav mumbai kii jagah latur ke gaategaanv bhejne kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 If wife Sharmila Loya got a call, did she know that the body would go to Gategaon, not to Mumbai
 unka parivaar latur ke aas-paas rahata he to ho saktaa he ki yah vyaavhaarik faisla ho
 But it is not known whose decision it was to move from Nagpur to Gategaon
 yah tabhi saaf hoga jab sharmila loya khud media ke saamne aakar apni sthiti saaf karengi
 Caravan has written that the call for the information of the death went to the wife as well as to the sisters and also to the father
 bahan anuraadhaa ye bataati hai ki phone par koi barde the jo apane ko jaj bataate hai, unka phone aayaa tha
 Sister Sarita also tells that a judge named Barde called
 indian express kii report main barde kaa naam saaf ho jaataa he
 He is Judge Barde
 jaj barde ko express kii report main local jaj kaha gaya he or inkaa puraa naam he jaj vijay kumaar barde
 It is in the express that Rupesh Rathi, Deputy Registrar of Nagpur Bench of High Court and Barde Justice Loya take him to Dande Hospital in a car
 kairavaan main likhaa he ki do jaj aato main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 It is written in the express that two judges take Judge Loya in the car
 justise sunil shukre ne kaha he ki jaj barde car khud chalaa rahe the
 Justice Gavai told our colleague Sunil Singh that he was the Senior Administrative Justice in Nagpur at that time
 express se bhi vahi kehete hai ki varisht prashaskeey jaj hone ke naate unhen hi phone kiya or tab ve apane saathi jaj sunil shukre ko lekar meditirina aspatal pahunche
 Did not even wait for my driver
 donon ravi bhawan se ek mile kii duuri par rahete the
 Local judges, deputy registrars, judge Kulkarni and Judge Modak were also there to take the judge to the hospital
 justise gawai ne sunil singh ko yah bhi bataaya he ki ravi bhawan main kul paanch kamare book the magar raat main teenon ne ek hi kamare main rahanaa pansad kiya
 Because everyone's return ticket was the same and was to return to Mumbai the next morning
 mumbai se gaye donon jaj shav ke saath isliye nahin gaye kyonki ve dost kii maut ke sadame main the
 In Caravan, Anuradha Biyani has said that the two judges did not meet the family for a month and a half
 ab aap dekh rahe hai ki jab jaj loya kii bahanon ne sawaal kiya to jaj sahiban chup the
 Now the family members are silent, then Judge Sahiban is speaking
 jaanch kaa elaan abhi tak nahin hua he
 Judge Loya's son wrote a letter to the then Chief Justice saying that i am afraid that these leaders may harm any member of my family
 mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 Our life is in danger ek jaj kaa betaa chif justise ko patr likhata he
 80 days after death
 yah patr kairavaan patrika ne apane video main dikhaaya he
 After this letter, was the family given protection, why not? enditivi ke maanas ne apni report main kaha he ki ravi bhawan main kisi bhi jaj ke liye koi car desiganet nahin thi
 Some staff members of Ravi Bhavan told Manas on condition of anonymity
 yah bhi dekha janaa chahie ki ghatana ke aasapaas maharashtra vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hone vaala tha
 Was there any ambulance in Ravi Bhavan at that time
 yah sab jaanch se pataa chalegaa, media trial se nahin
 It is written in the express that Judge Loya complained of chest pain at 4 o'clock but it is a quarter past five to reach the nearest hospital by car
 subah ke vakt teen kilometre kaa faasla tay karne main kya 45 minute laganaa chahie
 The answer is not known
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jaj loya ko seene main kab dard hua
 It has different versions
 kairavaan main niranjan taakale ne likhaa he ki saadhe baarah baje seene main dard hua
 According to Anuradha Biyani, both the judges had told this to the family
 kairavaan ke anusaar postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki 4 baje dard hua or sava 6 baje maut hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai told the Indian Express that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at around 4 am
 enditivi se justise bhushan gawai ne kaha he ki saadhe teen baje jaj loya kii tabiyat karaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai has spoken to our colleague Sunil Singh
 is sandarbh main anuraadhaa biyani kaa bayaan mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki donon jajon ne bataaya ki saadhe baarah baje seene main takalif hui
 Meaning Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni
 magar justise gawai ke anusaar to donon subah ke vakt jaj loya ko lekar aspataal gaye the
 The report of the post-mortem is important but you know what messes with the post-mortem report in this country
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki is cese main yahi hua he, main bas sandarbh ke liye bataa rahaa hum
 Who is saying the right thing will be known only through investigation
 aap bhi kisi par bevajaah shaq na karen
 Another question was answered when Sunil Singh spoke to Justice Gavai
 unke anusaar justise modak or justise kulkarani hi jaj loya ke saath gaye the
 According to Gawai, he met Judge Loya for the first time in marriage
 unke mutabik samaaroh se nikalakar teenon log gokul peth paan khaane gaye the
 The trio meant Judge Loya, Justice Kulakarni and Justice Modak went to eat paan
 justise gawai ko subah chah baje dipti register ne phone kar jaj loya ke maut kii soochna di, or tab ve meditrina aspataal gaye jahaan par justise modak, justise kulkarani, jaj barde or dipti register maujuud the
 Justice Gavai went to the ICU and there were no blood stains on his body
 maut kii soochna har jagah chah baje hai
 Sarita, another sister of Judge Loya, has told Niranjan Takle of Caravan that at five o'clock Judge Barde got a call that Brijgopal had died
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG
 isiji kii report main upar brijagopal lohia likhaa he or neeche kii taarikh 30 november he
 While the death occurred on November 1
 kya isiji mashin se aisi chook ho jaati he
 The hospital has said about this that the date of November 30 is visible, it may be technical fault
 ham har teen maheene par apni mashin ko ri-calibratt karte hai taaki aisi chook na ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi bich-bich main aisi gadabadi ho jaati he
 We stand by our facts
 isiji disambar ek taarikh ko hui thi
 The hospital later revealed the express, which the Express has published on its website
 kya us rose or bhi report par 30 november kii tarif chhapi thi, ye sab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Some people started looking at ECG and started saying that ECG is normal
 hamane do doctoron se baat kii lekin ek chetavanee dhyaan main rakhiegaa
 The disease is not detected by a report, and also by a report
 yah sari baaten jaanch ke daayre main honi chahie magar ab kairavaan or express ne alag-alag varjan chaape hai to hamane do doctoron se baat kar lee
 Anuradha has told Caravan that the hospital and doctors at Dande Hospital refused to give any details of what was done, while Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, spoke to the Express and gave details
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar sawaal maut ke baad kii gatividhiyon ko lekar jo soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan ho rahaa he, usamen kai jagah samanta he, kai jagah antar he
 No question arises concretely as to whether Judge Loya would have been murdered
 postmart ke vakt kai bade jaj maujuud the
 Its description proves to be true in many ways
 hamane yah sawaal kiya tha ki postmart kaa faisla kiskaa tha, lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako kanoon kii prakriya se hi milegaa
 Anuradha Biyani has told Caravan that as a doctor she knows that blood does not come out during the post-mortem and Biyani again demanded a post-mortem but Loya's friends and colleagues gathered there discouraged her saying that the case No need to further complicate
 kai adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki postmart ke samay khun nahin nikalataa lekin hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger ne forensik export dow
 Talked to KC Sharma
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko suchit kiye bina bhi postmortem ho jaataa he
 After the post-mortem, there are many reasons why blood gets put into clothes due to many reasons
 tippaniyan Express and Caravan have another character
 ishwar baheti
 In the caravan it is described as RSS
 express main inhen jaj loya ke mitra dow
 Baheti's brother is said to be and Judge Loya was in contact with Ishwar Baheti
 magar baheti ne express or kairavaan se baat nahin kii he
 At least they should contact the media about how they got Judge Loya's phone, how he reached the family with the phone three to four days after his death, is it true that the data was blown out of the phone, the same SMS was saved
 supreme court ke vakil sudeep shrivastav ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 There are a wide variety of questions that clash with each other
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne jo kaha he kya use jaanch se sabit kiya jayega, yaa phir ekatarfa idhar se yaa udhar se bayaan ke zarie khaarij kar diya jayega
 From the mobile tower, we can know who the judge went to, who he was talking to, whom Loya called, who called the wife from
 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 The purpose of my prime time was that no one should be afraid to speak up
 indian express ko bhi parivaar ke sadasyon se baat karne main safalataa nahin mili he
 It is therefore necessary that such an inquiry committee should be formed before which the family has confidence in going and the media trial should be stopped
 sawaal uth gaye hai jinase sambandhit dastauez or sawaal samiti ke saamne hi rakhen jaaen varna ek ek saboot ko lekar tivi par bahes hogi to vahi saboot kabhi sahi lagegaa or kabhi galat
 The first report of Caravan came on 21 November, Indian Express on 27 November
 chah dinon kii charchaa ke baad agar parivaar khul kar bolne kaa saahas nahin juta paa rahaa he to chintaa kii baat he
 Are they scared or is there any talk within the family
 jo log jaanch agenciyon kii harkaton, lambii kanoonee prakriyaaon se guzaren hai wo jaanate hai ki us taraf jane ke kya anjaam hote hai
 Therefore their fear can be understood
 magar unhen pataa hona chahie ki inhen sab ke bich aam se aam log system se ladate hai or insaaf bhi pate hai
 Niranjan Takle of Caravan has written that 80 days after the death of Judge Loya, he demanded a probe, did not approve on 18 February 2015
 aisa nahin tha ki parivaar ne teen saal baad chuppi todi he, chup to ab bhi he, bolne kaa saahas nahin juta paa rahaa he
 Judge Loya's wife and son did not talk to Niranjan Takle of Caravan, writing that he feared death
 express ke vivek deshpandey or maurya jaanwalkar se bhi maa bete ne baat nahin kii
 If mother and son are not talking with any fear then it is a matter of concern
 kairavaan patrika ke niranjan taakale ne jaj loya ke pita harikishan loya se november 2016 main mulaakaat kii thi
 Then he said that i am 85 years old, not afraid of death, but the girls and their children are worried about their lives
 express ne likhaa he ki harikishan loya, anuraadhaa biyani, sarita madhane kaa phone switch of, wo ghar par bhi nahin mili
 That is, those who talked to the caravan reporter could not contact the express reporters
 ghar par nahin mili
 Anuradha Biyani has given a video statement and is the only on record statement in this case
 kairavaan kii report bahan anuraadhaa biyani, sarita maanadhane or pita harikishan ke bayaan par aadhaarit he
 The Express has spoken to Srinivasa Loya, brother of Harikshan Loya, Justice Loya's uncle, who says his niece Anuradha has raised questions about the judge's death
 chachaa shrinivas loya ne enditivi se bhi baat karte hue kaha ki unhen yahi bataaya gaya tha ki postmortem ho chukaa he or shav ko baks main rakhkar nagpur se bheja ja chukaa he
 We were waiting for the dead body and when it arrived, there was no one else who was the ambulance driver
 yahi baat anuraadhaa biyani ne kahi he
 The name of the person who signed the body for autopsy after the post-mortem in the Caravan and Express reports
 prashanth rathi he
 Prashant Rathi has refused to talk on camera, he was tried by ndtv's Manas and Saurav Gupta
 prashanth rathi ne maanas se jo kaha or express se jo kaha usamen ek bahut bada antar he
 Prashant told ndtv's Manas that my uncle had reported the death of Judge Loya around six o'clock in the morning and that i immediately reached out to assist the family at the time of mourning
 dow prashanth rathi ne maanas se kaha ki ye ankal aurangabad main rahete hai or jaj loya ke kazin hai
 Rathi did not tell Manas that he had warts, used Uncle and cousin in English
 naam bhi nahin bataaya ki koun hai
 When we talk to the Rathi Express, it is clear that Moussa got a call and his name is Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia
 unka phone aata he ki unke kazin jaj loya meditrina aspataal main bhartee hai or mujhe loya kii madad ke liye kehete hai
 When i reach the hospital, the doctor says that he has died
 yah baat main apane ankal ko bataata hum
 Uncle asks me to take care of formalities
 ab aapane dekha ki prashanth rathi ek reporter se kehete hai ki ankal kaa phone aata he ki 6 baje loya kii maut ho gai he
 Loya tells a reporter that Loya is recruiting, help him
 aspataal jaakar pataa chalata he ki loya mar chuke hai
 Here is another question
 nagpur main doctor prashanth rathi hi akele sab manage kar rahe the to kya unase loya ke parivaar ke kisi kareebi ne baar-baar baat kii, jaanane ke liye ki kya ho rahaa he, shav kahaan le jayega
 Can Dr
 Rathi tell who was told by the family that the body will go to Gategaon, not Latur, to Mumbai
 dow prashanth rathi ne camere par baat karne se inkaar kar diya
 It is not clear how close Rathi's warts were to Jakotia judge Loya, was he talking to his father, was Anuradha talking to Biyani? Dr Prashant Rathi told Manas of NDTV that he had not seen the body of Judge Loya
 unhen ek chadar main lapeta gaya tha
 They just signed on
 kairavaan kii report main bahan anuraadhaa biyani nagpur main kisi rishtedaar kii baat karti hai magar naam nahin bataati hai
 There is no mention of Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia in their conversation, nor the name of Judge Loya's father
 prashanth rathi ne postmortem report main sin karte hue khud ko mritak kaa chachera bhai bataaya he
 From the father's side
 magar unke mausa jaj loya ko apana bhai bataate hai
 a wart's brother was like a wart
 to rathi ne khud ko loya kaa chachera bhai kaise bataa diya
 If i am right then Rathi Loya and Jakotia's nephew
 kya rukmesh pannalaal jakotia jaj loya kii patni, pita or bahan anuraadhaa ke sampark main the
 It is not clear from the report of the express that it was decided to send the dead body to Gategaon in place of Mumbai
 patni sharmila loya ko phone gaya tha to kya unhen pataa tha ki shav gaategaanv jayega, mumbai nahin aayega
 If his family lives around Latur, it may be a practical decision
 magar yahi nahin pataa chal rahaa he ki nagpur se gaategaanv le jane kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 This will be clear only when Sharmila Loya herself comes before the media and clarifies her position
 kairavaan ne yah to likhaa he ki maut kii soochna kaa phone patni ko bhi gaya, bahanon ko bhi or pita ko bhi
 Sister Anuradha says that there were some bards on the phone who call themselves judges, their call came
 bahan sarita bhi bataati hai ki barde naam ke jaj ne phone kiya tha
 The Indian Express report clears Barde's name
 ve jaj barde hai
 Judge Barde has been called a local judge in the report of the Express and his full name is Judge Vijay Kumar Barde
 express main he ki hoicourt ke nagpur bench ke dipti register rupesh rathi or barde justise loya ko dande aspataal lekar jate hai car main
 It is written in Caravan that two judges take Judge Loya in auto
 express main likhaa he ki do jaj car main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 Justice Sunil Shukre has said that Judge Barde was driving the car himself
 hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se justise gawai ne kaha ki ve us vakt nagpur main senior administrative justise the
 He also says from the Express that he, as a senior administrative judge, called him and then he reached Mediterina Hospital with his fellow judge Sunil Shukre
 apane dryver kaa bhi intazaar nahin kiya
 Both lived about a mile from Ravi Bhavan
 jaj ko lekar aspataal le jane main local jaj, dipti register, jaj kulkarani or jaj modak bhi the
 Justice Gavai has also told Sunil Singh that a total of five rooms were booked in Ravi Bhavan but at night all three preferred to stay in one room
 kyonki sabhi kii vaapasi kaa tikat ek hi saath kaa tha or agali subah mumbai lautnaa tha
 The two judges from Mumbai did not accompany the body because they were shocked by the death of the friend
 kairavaan main anuraadhaa biyani ne kaha he ki donon jaj dedh maheene tak parivaar se nahin mili
 Now you see that when Judge Loya's sisters questioned, Judge Sahiban was silent
 ab parivaar ke log chup hai to jaj sahiban apni baat rakh rahe hai
 The investigation has not been announced yet
 jaj loya ke bete ne tab ke chif justise ko patr likhaa tha ki mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 i do not have the strength to fight them
 hamaari zindagi khatare main he
 The son of a judge writes a letter to the Chief Justice
 maut ke 80 din baad
 This letter has been shown by Caravan magazine in its video
 is patr ke baad kya parivaar ko suraksha di gai, kyon nahin di gai? Manas of NDTV has stated in its report that there was no car designate for any judge in Ravi Bhavan
 yah baat ravi bhawan ke kuch staff ne maanas ko naam naa lene ke shart par bataai
 It should also be seen that the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly session was about to begin around the event
 kya us vakt ravi bhawan main koi ambulance thi
 All this investigation will reveal, not through media trials
 express main likhaa he ki jaj loya ne 4 baje seene main dard kii shikaayat kii lekin car se nikatom aspataal pahunchane main paune paanch baj jate hai
 What should take 45 minutes to cover the distance of three kilometers in the morning
 iskaa jawaab maaloom nahin he
 Now the question arises when Judge Loya got chest pain
 iske alag alag varjan hai
 In Caravan, Niranjan Takle has written that he had chest pain at 12:30
 anuraadhaa biyani ke anusaar donon jajon ne yah baat parivaar ko bataai thi
 According to Caravan, the post-mortem report said that there was pain at 4 o'clock and death at 6
15 o'clock
 indian express ko justise bhushan gawai ne bataaya ki jaj loya kii kareeb 4 baje tabiyat kharaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai from NDTV has said that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at 3:30 pm
 justise bhushan gawai ne hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se baat kii he
 In this context, Anuradha Biyani's statement becomes important that both the judges said that there was a chest problem at 12:30
 matlab justise modak or justise kulkarani ne
 But according to Justice Gavai, both went to the hospital in the morning with Judge Loya
 postmortem kii report kaa mahatv he magar aap jaanate hai ki is desh main postmortem kii report ke saath kya kya khilwaad ho jate hai
 This does not mean that this is what happened in this case, i am just referring for reference
 koun sahi bol rahaa he yah to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Do not doubt anyone unnecessarily
 sunil singh ne jab justise gawai se baat kii to ek or sawaal kaa jawaab mila
 According to him, only Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni went with Judge Loya
 gawai ke mutabik pehali baar ve shaadi main jaj loya se mili the
 According to him, the three people went out of the ceremony to eat Gokul Peth Paan
 teenon kaa matlab jaj loya, justise kulkarani or justise modak paan khaane gaye the
 Justice Gavai was called by the Deputy Registrar at six in the morning to inform Judge Loya's death, and then he went to the Meditrina Hospital where Justice Modak, Justice Kulakarni, Judge Barde and Deputy Registrar were present
 justise gawai isiu main gaye the or unke sharir par kahin koon ke nishaan nahin the
 Notice of death is everywhere at six o'clock
 jaj loya kii ek or bahan sarita ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se kaha he ki paanch baje jaj barde kaa phone aayaa tha ki brijagopal kii maut ho chuki he
 Whether a difference in time can be doubted, at least not in a media trial
 indian express kii report ke baad isiji kii chhapi hui tasviir ko lekar thodi sansani ho gai
 Brijgopal Lohia is written in the ECG report above and the date below is 30 November
 jabaki maut ek november ko hui he
 Does the ECG machine cause such a lapse
 aspataal ne is bare main kaha he ki 30 november kii jo taarikh dikh rahi he, wo takniki kharabi ho sakati he
 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai
 The ECG took place on December 1
 aspataal ne baad main express ko bataaya he jise express ne apni website par chapa he
 Whether there was a compliment on the report on that day, on 30 November, all this will be known only by investigation
 kuch logon ne isiji ko dekhakar kahana shuru kar diya ki isiji saamaanya he
 We spoke to two doctors but keep in mind a warning
 beemaari kaa pataa ek report se nahin chalata he, or ek report se bhi chalata he
 All these things should be under scrutiny, but now Caravan and Express have printed different versions, then we talked to two doctors
 anuraadhaa ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki dande haspital ke doctoron or karmchaariyon ne kya chikitsa kii gai iskaa koi vivaran dene se haspital ne inkaar kar diya, vahiin dande hospital ke nideshak pinaak dande ne express se baat kii he or byora diya
 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death, there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places
 koi bhi sawaal is baat ko thos rup se uthta nahin dikhaa ki kya jaj loya kii hatya kii gai hogi
 Many big judges were present during the post-mart
 iskaa vivaran kai tarah se sahi sabit hota he
 We had asked the question of whose decision the post-mart was, but you will get the answer to this question only through the process of law
 anuraadhaa biyani ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki doctor hone ke kaaran wo jaanati hai ki postmortem ke dauraan khun nahin nikalataa or biyani ne dobaaraa postmortem kii maang kii thi lekin vahaan ikatthe loya ke doston or sahakarmiyon ne unhen hatotsahit kiya ki yah kehete hue ki maamle ko or jatil banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Many officials say that blood does not come out at the time of postmart but our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar has given forensic expert Dr
 ke si sharma se baat kii
 He said the postmortem also happens without informing the family
 postmart hone ke baad kai baar kapadon main rakt lag jaataa he jiske kai kaaran hote hai
 The comments express or kairavaan main ek or kirdaar he
 Ishwar Bahati kairavaan main ise aresas kaa bataaya gaya he
 In the Express, these were Judge Loya's friends, Dr
 baheti kaa bhai bataaya gaya he or jaj loya ishwar baheti ke sampark main the
 But Baheti has not talked to Express and Caravan
 kam se kam unhen media se sampark karnaa chahie ki unke paas jaj loya kaa phone kaise aayaa, wo maut ke teen chaar dinon baad phone lekar kaise parivaar ke paas pahunch gaye, kya yah sahi he ki phone se data uda diya gaya tha, ek hi esemes bachaa tha
 Supreme Court lawyer Sudeep Srivastava has raised some questions
 bahut tarah ke sawaal hai jo ek duusare se takaraa rahe hai
 Whether the family members have said it will be proved by investigation, or it will be unilaterally dismissed from here or there through the statement
 mobile tower se pataa chal saktaa he ki koun jaj kahaan tak gaye the, koun kisase baat kar rahaa tha, loya ne kise phone kiya, patni ko kis number se phone gaya
 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 jaj loya kii patni or bete ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se baat nahin kii, likhaa he ki unhen jaan kaa dar he
 The mother-son also did not talk to Vivek Deshpande and Maurya Janwalkar of Express
 agar maa bete kisi dar se baat nahin kar rahe hai to yah chintaa kii baat he
 Niranjan Takle of Caravan magazine met Judge Loya's father Harikishan Loya in November 2016
 tab unhone kaha tha ki 85 saal kaa ho chukaa hum, maut kaa dar nahin, magar bacchiyon or unke bacchon kii jaan kii phikr he
 Express has written that Harikishan Loya, Anuradha Biyani, Sarita Mandhane's phone switch off, they could not be found even at home
 yani jin logon ne kairavaan ke reporter se baat kii un logon se express ke reporter sampark nahin kar sake
 Not found at home anuraadhaa biyani ne video bayaan diya he or is cese main vahi ekmaatr on record bayaan he
 Caravan's report is based on the statements of sister Anuradha Biyani, Sarita Manadhane and father Harikishan
 express ne shrinivas loya, harikishan loya ke bhai, justise loya ke chachaa se baat kii he jo kehete hai ki unki bhatiji anuraadhaa ne jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai wo kaaphi ahm hai
 Uncle Srinivas Loya also spoke to NDTV, saying that he was told that the post-mortem had been done and the dead body was kept in the box and sent from Nagpur
 ham shav kaa intazaar kar rahe the or jab pahunchaa to ambulance kaa driver hi tha or koi nahin tha
 This is what Anuradha Biyani has said
 kairavaan or express kii report me postmortem ke baad shav lene ke liye jis vyakti ne hastakshar kiye hai unka naam dow
 Prashant is Rathi
 prashanth rathi ne camere par baat karne se inkaar kar diya he, unase enditivi ke maanas or saurav gupta ne sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 There is a big difference in what Prashant Rathi said to Manas and what he told the Express
 prashanth ne enditivi ke maanas se kaha ki mere ankal ne subah chah baje ke kareeb jaj loya kii maut kii soochna di or main shok ke samay main parivaar kii sahaayta ke liye turant pahunchaa
 Dr
 Prashant Rathi told Manas that he lives in Uncle Aurangabad and is the cousin of Judge Loya
 rathi ne maanas ko rishta nahin bataaya ki mausa hai, angrezi kaa ankal or kazin istamaal kiya
 The name was not even told who it was
 yahi rathi express se baat karte hai to saaf-saaf kehete hai ki mausa kaa phone aayaa or unka naam rukmesh pannalaal jakotia he
 He gets a call that his cousin Judge Loya is admitted to the Meditrina Hospital and asks me to help Loya
 jab main aspataal pahunchataa hum to doctor bataate hai ki unki maut ho chuki he
 i tell this to my uncle
 ankal mujhe aupchaariktaaon kaa dhyaan rakhane ke liye kehete hai
 Now you see that Prashant Rathi tells a reporter that Uncle's phone call that Loya has died at 6 o'clock
 ek reporter se kehete hai ki loya bhartee hai, unki madad karen
 Going to the hospital, he learns that Loya is dead
 yahaan ek or sawaal he
 In Nagpur, Dr
 Prashant Rathi was the only one managing all, so did someone close to Loya's family repeatedly talk to him, to know what is going on, where the body will be taken
 kya doctor rathi bataa sakate hai ki unase parivaar ke kisne kaha ki shav mumbai nahin, latur se sata gaategaanv jayega
 Dr
 Prashant Rathi refused to speak on camera
 yah saaf nahin he ki rathi ke mausa jakotia jaj loya ke kitne kareebi the, kya ve pita se baat kar rahe the, kya anuraadhaa biyani se baat kar rahe the? dow prashanth rathi ne enditivi ke maanas ko bataaya ki unhone jaj loya ke shav ko nahin dekha tha
 They were wrapped in a sheet
 bas unhone sin kar diya
 In Caravan's report, sister Anuradha Biyani talks about a relative in Nagpur but does not mention the name
 unki baatcheet main rukmesh pannalaal jakotia kaa koi zikr nahin he, na hi jaj loya ke pita ne naam liya he
 Prashant Rathi, signing the post-mortem report, described himself as the cousin of the deceased
 pita ke said se
 But his warts call Judge Loya his brother
 mausa kaa bhai to mausa ke baraabar hua
 So how did Rathi tell herself Loya's cousin
 agar main sahi hum to rathi loya or jakotia ke bhatija lagenge
 Was Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia in touch with Judge Loya's wife, father and sister Anuradha
 express kii report se saaf nahin hota he ki shav mumbai kii jagah latur ke gaategaanv bhejne kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 If wife Sharmila Loya got a call, did she know that the body would go to Gategaon, not to Mumbai
 unka parivaar latur ke aas-paas rahata he to ho saktaa he ki yah vyaavhaarik faisla ho
 But it is not known whose decision it was to move from Nagpur to Gategaon
 yah tabhi saaf hoga jab sharmila loya khud media ke saamne aakar apni sthiti saaf karengi
 Caravan has written that the call for the information of the death went to the wife as well as to the sisters and also to the father
 bahan anuraadhaa ye bataati hai ki phone par koi barde the jo apane ko jaj bataate hai, unka phone aayaa tha
 Sister Sarita also tells that a judge named Barde called
 indian express kii report main barde kaa naam saaf ho jaataa he
 He is Judge Barde
 jaj barde ko express kii report main local jaj kaha gaya he or inkaa puraa naam he jaj vijay kumaar barde
 It is in the express that Rupesh Rathi, Deputy Registrar of Nagpur Bench of High Court and Barde Justice Loya take him to Dande Hospital in a car
 kairavaan main likhaa he ki do jaj aato main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 It is written in the express that two judges take Judge Loya in the car
 justise sunil shukre ne kaha he ki jaj barde car khud chalaa rahe the
 Justice Gavai told our colleague Sunil Singh that he was the Senior Administrative Justice in Nagpur at that time
 express se bhi vahi kehete hai ki varisht prashaskeey jaj hone ke naate unhen hi phone kiya or tab ve apane saathi jaj sunil shukre ko lekar meditirina aspatal pahunche
 Did not even wait for my driver
 donon ravi bhawan se ek mile kii duuri par rahete the
 Local judges, deputy registrars, judge Kulkarni and Judge Modak were also there to take the judge to the hospital
 justise gawai ne sunil singh ko yah bhi bataaya he ki ravi bhawan main kul paanch kamare book the magar raat main teenon ne ek hi kamare main rahanaa pansad kiya
 Because everyone's return ticket was the same and was to return to Mumbai the next morning
 mumbai se gaye donon jaj shav ke saath isliye nahin gaye kyonki ve dost kii maut ke sadame main the
 In Caravan, Anuradha Biyani has said that the two judges did not meet the family for a month and a half
 ab aap dekh rahe hai ki jab jaj loya kii bahanon ne sawaal kiya to jaj sahiban chup the
 Now the family members are silent, then Judge Sahiban is speaking
 jaanch kaa elaan abhi tak nahin hua he
 Judge Loya's son wrote a letter to the then Chief Justice saying that i am afraid that these leaders may harm any member of my family
 mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 Our life is in danger ek jaj kaa betaa chif justise ko patr likhata he
 80 days after death
 yah patr kairavaan patrika ne apane video main dikhaaya he
 After this letter, was the family given protection, why not? enditivi ke maanas ne apni report main kaha he ki ravi bhawan main kisi bhi jaj ke liye koi car desiganet nahin thi
 Some staff members of Ravi Bhavan told Manas on condition of anonymity
 yah bhi dekha janaa chahie ki ghatana ke aasapaas maharashtra vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hone vaala tha
 Was there any ambulance in Ravi Bhavan at that time
 yah sab jaanch se pataa chalegaa, media trial se nahin
 It is written in the express that Judge Loya complained of chest pain at 4 o'clock but it is a quarter past five to reach the nearest hospital by car
 subah ke vakt teen kilometre kaa faasla tay karne main kya 45 minute laganaa chahie
 The answer is not known
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jaj loya ko seene main kab dard hua
 It has different versions
 kairavaan main niranjan taakale ne likhaa he ki saadhe baarah baje seene main dard hua
 According to Anuradha Biyani, both the judges had told this to the family
 kairavaan ke anusaar postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki 4 baje dard hua or sava 6 baje maut hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai told the Indian Express that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at around 4 am
 enditivi se justise bhushan gawai ne kaha he ki saadhe teen baje jaj loya kii tabiyat karaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai has spoken to our colleague Sunil Singh
 is sandarbh main anuraadhaa biyani kaa bayaan mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki donon jajon ne bataaya ki saadhe baarah baje seene main takalif hui
 Meaning Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni
 magar justise gawai ke anusaar to donon subah ke vakt jaj loya ko lekar aspataal gaye the
 The report of the post-mortem is important but you know what messes with the post-mortem report in this country
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki is cese main yahi hua he, main bas sandarbh ke liye bataa rahaa hum
 Who is saying the right thing will be known only through investigation
 aap bhi kisi par bevajaah shaq na karen
 Another question was answered when Sunil Singh spoke to Justice Gavai
 unke anusaar justise modak or justise kulkarani hi jaj loya ke saath gaye the
 According to Gawai, he met Judge Loya for the first time in marriage
 unke mutabik samaaroh se nikalakar teenon log gokul peth paan khaane gaye the
 The trio meant Judge Loya, Justice Kulakarni and Justice Modak went to eat paan
 justise gawai ko subah chah baje dipti register ne phone kar jaj loya ke maut kii soochna di, or tab ve meditrina aspataal gaye jahaan par justise modak, justise kulkarani, jaj barde or dipti register maujuud the
 Justice Gavai went to the ICU and there were no blood stains on his body
 maut kii soochna har jagah chah baje hai
 Sarita, another sister of Judge Loya, has told Niranjan Takle of Caravan that at five o'clock Judge Barde got a call that Brijgopal had died
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG
 isiji kii report main upar brijagopal lohia likhaa he or neeche kii taarikh 30 november he
 While the death occurred on November 1
 kya isiji mashin se aisi chook ho jaati he
 The hospital has said about this that the date of November 30 is visible, it may be technical fault
 ham har teen maheene par apni mashin ko ri-calibratt karte hai taaki aisi chook na ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi bich-bich main aisi gadabadi ho jaati he
 We stand by our facts
 isiji disambar ek taarikh ko hui thi
 The hospital later revealed the express, which the Express has published on its website
 kya us rose or bhi report par 30 november kii tarif chhapi thi, ye sab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Some people started looking at ECG and started saying that ECG is normal
 hamane do doctoron se baat kii lekin ek chetavanee dhyaan main rakhiegaa
 The disease is not detected by a report, and also by a report
 yah sari baaten jaanch ke daayre main honi chahie magar ab kairavaan or express ne alag-alag varjan chaape hai to hamane do doctoron se baat kar lee
 Anuradha has told Caravan that the hospital and doctors at Dande Hospital refused to give any details of what was done, while Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, spoke to the Express and gave details
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar sawaal maut ke baad kii gatividhiyon ko lekar jo soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan ho rahaa he, usamen kai jagah samanta he, kai jagah antar he
 No question arises concretely as to whether Judge Loya would have been murdered
 postmart ke vakt kai bade jaj maujuud the
 Its description proves to be true in many ways
 hamane yah sawaal kiya tha ki postmart kaa faisla kiskaa tha, lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako kanoon kii prakriya se hi milegaa
 Anuradha Biyani has told Caravan that as a doctor she knows that blood does not come out during the post-mortem and Biyani again demanded a post-mortem but Loya's friends and colleagues gathered there discouraged her saying that the case No need to further complicate
 kai adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki postmart ke samay khun nahin nikalataa lekin hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger ne forensik export dow
 Talked to KC Sharma
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko suchit kiye bina bhi postmortem ho jaataa he
 After the post-mortem, there are many reasons why blood gets put into clothes due to many reasons
 tippaniyan Express and Caravan have another character
 ishwar baheti
 In the caravan it is described as RSS
 express main inhen jaj loya ke mitra dow
 Baheti's brother is said to be and Judge Loya was in contact with Ishwar Baheti
 magar baheti ne express or kairavaan se baat nahin kii he
 At least they should contact the media about how they got Judge Loya's phone, how he reached the family with the phone three to four days after his death, is it true that the data was blown out of the phone, the same SMS was saved
 supreme court ke vakil sudeep shrivastav ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 There are a wide variety of questions that clash with each other
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne jo kaha he kya use jaanch se sabit kiya jayega, yaa phir ekatarfa idhar se yaa udhar se bayaan ke zarie khaarij kar diya jayega
 From the mobile tower, we can know who the judge went to, who he was talking to, whom Loya called, who called the wife from
 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 Express has written that Harikishan Loya, Anuradha Biyani, Sarita Mandhane's phone switch off, they could not be found even at home
 yani jin logon ne kairavaan ke reporter se baat kii un logon se express ke reporter sampark nahin kar sake
 Not found at home anuraadhaa biyani ne video bayaan diya he or is cese main vahi ekmaatr on record bayaan he
 Caravan's report is based on the statements of sister Anuradha Biyani, Sarita Manadhane and father Harikishan
 express ne shrinivas loya, harikishan loya ke bhai, justise loya ke chachaa se baat kii he jo kehete hai ki unki bhatiji anuraadhaa ne jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai wo kaaphi ahm hai
 Uncle Srinivas Loya also spoke to NDTV, saying that he was told that the post-mortem had been done and the dead body was kept in the box and sent from Nagpur

 express se bhi vahi kehete hai ki varisht prashaskeey jaj hone ke naate unhen hi phone kiya or tab ve apane saathi jaj sunil shukre ko lekar meditirina aspatal pahunche
 Did not even wait for my driver
 donon ravi bhawan se ek mile kii duuri par rahete the
 Local judges, deputy registrars, judge Kulkarni and Judge Modak were also there to take the judge to the hospital
 justise gawai ne sunil singh ko yah bhi bataaya he ki ravi bhawan main kul paanch kamare book the magar raat main teenon ne ek hi kamare main rahanaa pansad kiya
 Because everyone's return ticket was the same and was to return to Mumbai the next morning
 mumbai se gaye donon jaj shav ke saath isliye nahin gaye kyonki ve dost kii maut ke sadame main the
 In Caravan, Anuradha Biyani has said that the two judges did not meet the family for a month and a half
 ab aap dekh rahe hai ki jab jaj loya kii bahanon ne sawaal kiya to jaj sahiban chup the
 Now the family members are silent, then Judge Sahiban is speaking
 jaanch kaa elaan abhi tak nahin hua he
 Judge Loya's son wrote a letter to the then Chief Justice saying that i am afraid that these leaders may harm any member of my family
 mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 Our life is in danger ek jaj kaa betaa chif justise ko patr likhata he
 80 days after death
 yah patr kairavaan patrika ne apane video main dikhaaya he
 After this letter, was the family given protection, why not? enditivi ke maanas ne apni report main kaha he ki ravi bhawan main kisi bhi jaj ke liye koi car desiganet nahin thi
 Some staff members of Ravi Bhavan told Manas on condition of anonymity
 yah bhi dekha janaa chahie ki ghatana ke aasapaas maharashtra vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hone vaala tha
 Was there any ambulance in Ravi Bhavan at that time
 yah sab jaanch se pataa chalegaa, media trial se nahin
 It is written in the express that Judge Loya complained of chest pain at 4 o'clock but it is a quarter past five to reach the nearest hospital by car
 subah ke vakt teen kilometre kaa faasla tay karne main kya 45 minute laganaa chahie
 The answer is not known
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jaj loya ko seene main kab dard hua
 It has different versions
 kairavaan main niranjan taakale ne likhaa he ki saadhe baarah baje seene main dard hua
 According to Anuradha Biyani, both the judges had told this to the family
 kairavaan ke anusaar postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki 4 baje dard hua or sava 6 baje maut hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai told the Indian Express that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at around 4 am
 enditivi se justise bhushan gawai ne kaha he ki saadhe teen baje jaj loya kii tabiyat karaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai has spoken to our colleague Sunil Singh
 is sandarbh main anuraadhaa biyani kaa bayaan mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki donon jajon ne bataaya ki saadhe baarah baje seene main takalif hui
 Meaning Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni
 magar justise gawai ke anusaar to donon subah ke vakt jaj loya ko lekar aspataal gaye the
 The report of the post-mortem is important but you know what messes with the post-mortem report in this country
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki is cese main yahi hua he, main bas sandarbh ke liye bataa rahaa hum
 Who is saying the right thing will be known only through investigation
 aap bhi kisi par bevajaah shaq na karen
 Another question was answered when Sunil Singh spoke to Justice Gavai
 unke anusaar justise modak or justise kulkarani hi jaj loya ke saath gaye the
 According to Gawai, he met Judge Loya for the first time in marriage
 unke mutabik samaaroh se nikalakar teenon log gokul peth paan khaane gaye the
 The trio meant Judge Loya, Justice Kulakarni and Justice Modak went to eat paan
 justise gawai ko subah chah baje dipti register ne phone kar jaj loya ke maut kii soochna di, or tab ve meditrina aspataal gaye jahaan par justise modak, justise kulkarani, jaj barde or dipti register maujuud the
 Justice Gavai went to the ICU and there were no blood stains on his body
 maut kii soochna har jagah chah baje hai
 Sarita, another sister of Judge Loya, has told Niranjan Takle of Caravan that at five o'clock Judge Barde got a call that Brijgopal had died
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG
 isiji kii report main upar brijagopal lohia likhaa he or neeche kii taarikh 30 november he
 While the death occurred on November 1
 kya isiji mashin se aisi chook ho jaati he
 The hospital has said about this that the date of November 30 is visible, it may be technical fault
 ham har teen maheene par apni mashin ko ri-calibratt karte hai taaki aisi chook na ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi bich-bich main aisi gadabadi ho jaati he
 We stand by our facts
 isiji disambar ek taarikh ko hui thi
 The hospital later revealed the express, which the Express has published on its website
 kya us rose or bhi report par 30 november kii tarif chhapi thi, ye sab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Some people started looking at ECG and started saying that ECG is normal
 hamane do doctoron se baat kii lekin ek chetavanee dhyaan main rakhiegaa
 The disease is not detected by a report, and also by a report
 yah sari baaten jaanch ke daayre main honi chahie magar ab kairavaan or express ne alag-alag varjan chaape hai to hamane do doctoron se baat kar lee
 Anuradha has told Caravan that the hospital and doctors at Dande Hospital refused to give any details of what was done, while Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, spoke to the Express and gave details
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar sawaal maut ke baad kii gatividhiyon ko lekar jo soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan ho rahaa he, usamen kai jagah samanta he, kai jagah antar he
 No question arises concretely as to whether Judge Loya would have been murdered
 postmart ke vakt kai bade jaj maujuud the
 Its description proves to be true in many ways
 hamane yah sawaal kiya tha ki postmart kaa faisla kiskaa tha, lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako kanoon kii prakriya se hi milegaa
 Anuradha Biyani has told Caravan that as a doctor she knows that blood does not come out during the post-mortem and Biyani again demanded a post-mortem but Loya's friends and colleagues gathered there discouraged her saying that the case No need to further complicate
 kai adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki postmart ke samay khun nahin nikalataa lekin hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger ne forensik export dow
 Talked to KC Sharma
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko suchit kiye bina bhi postmortem ho jaataa he
 After the post-mortem, there are many reasons why blood gets put into clothes due to many reasons
 tippaniyan Express and Caravan have another character
 ishwar baheti
 In the caravan it is described as RSS
 express main inhen jaj loya ke mitra dow
 Baheti's brother is said to be and Judge Loya was in contact with Ishwar Baheti
 magar baheti ne express or kairavaan se baat nahin kii he
 At least they should contact the media about how they got Judge Loya's phone, how he reached the family with the phone three to four days after his death, is it true that the data was blown out of the phone, the same SMS was saved
 supreme court ke vakil sudeep shrivastav ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 There are a wide variety of questions that clash with each other
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne jo kaha he kya use jaanch se sabit kiya jayega, yaa phir ekatarfa idhar se yaa udhar se bayaan ke zarie khaarij kar diya jayega
 From the mobile tower, we can know who the judge went to, who he was talking to, whom Loya called, who called the wife from
 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 Caravan's report is based on the statements of sister Anuradha Biyani, Sarita Manadhane and father Harikishan
 express ne shrinivas loya, harikishan loya ke bhai, justise loya ke chachaa se baat kii he jo kehete hai ki unki bhatiji anuraadhaa ne jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai wo kaaphi ahm hai
 Uncle Srinivas Loya also spoke to NDTV, saying that he was told that the post-mortem had been done and the dead body was kept in the box and sent from Nagpur
 ham shav kaa intazaar kar rahe the or jab pahunchaa to ambulance kaa driver hi tha or koi nahin tha
 This is what Anuradha Biyani has said
 kairavaan or express kii report me postmortem ke baad shav lene ke liye jis vyakti ne hastakshar kiye hai unka naam dow
 Prashant is Rathi
 prashanth rathi ne camere par baat karne se inkaar kar diya he, unase enditivi ke maanas or saurav gupta ne sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 There is a big difference in what Prashant Rathi said to Manas and what he told the Express
 prashanth ne enditivi ke maanas se kaha ki mere ankal ne subah chah baje ke kareeb jaj loya kii maut kii soochna di or main shok ke samay main parivaar kii sahaayta ke liye turant pahunchaa
 Dr
 Prashant Rathi told Manas that he lives in Uncle Aurangabad and is the cousin of Judge Loya
 rathi ne maanas ko rishta nahin bataaya ki mausa hai, angrezi kaa ankal or kazin istamaal kiya
 The name was not even told who it was
 yahi rathi express se baat karte hai to saaf-saaf kehete hai ki mausa kaa phone aayaa or unka naam rukmesh pannalaal jakotia he
 He gets a call that his cousin Judge Loya is admitted to the Meditrina Hospital and asks me to help Loya
 jab main aspataal pahunchataa hum to doctor bataate hai ki unki maut ho chuki he
 i tell this to my uncle
 ankal mujhe aupchaariktaaon kaa dhyaan rakhane ke liye kehete hai
 Now you see that Prashant Rathi tells a reporter that Uncle's phone call that Loya has died at 6 o'clock
 ek reporter se kehete hai ki loya bhartee hai, unki madad karen
 Going to the hospital, he learns that Loya is dead
 yahaan ek or sawaal he
 In Nagpur, Dr
 Prashant Rathi was the only one managing all, so did someone close to Loya's family repeatedly talk to him, to know what is going on, where the body will be taken
 kya doctor rathi bataa sakate hai ki unase parivaar ke kisne kaha ki shav mumbai nahin, latur se sata gaategaanv jayega
 Dr
 Prashant Rathi refused to speak on camera
 yah saaf nahin he ki rathi ke mausa jakotia jaj loya ke kitne kareebi the, kya ve pita se baat kar rahe the, kya anuraadhaa biyani se baat kar rahe the? dow prashanth rathi ne enditivi ke maanas ko bataaya ki unhone jaj loya ke shav ko nahin dekha tha
 They were wrapped in a sheet
 bas unhone sin kar diya
 In Caravan's report, sister Anuradha Biyani talks about a relative in Nagpur but does not mention the name
 unki baatcheet main rukmesh pannalaal jakotia kaa koi zikr nahin he, na hi jaj loya ke pita ne naam liya he
 Prashant Rathi, signing the post-mortem report, described himself as the cousin of the deceased
 pita ke said se
 But his warts call Judge Loya his brother
 mausa kaa bhai to mausa ke baraabar hua
 So how did Rathi tell herself Loya's cousin
 agar main sahi hum to rathi loya or jakotia ke bhatija lagenge
 Was Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia in touch with Judge Loya's wife, father and sister Anuradha
 express kii report se saaf nahin hota he ki shav mumbai kii jagah latur ke gaategaanv bhejne kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 If wife Sharmila Loya got a call, did she know that the body would go to Gategaon, not to Mumbai
 unka parivaar latur ke aas-paas rahata he to ho saktaa he ki yah vyaavhaarik faisla ho
 But it is not known whose decision it was to move from Nagpur to Gategaon
 yah tabhi saaf hoga jab sharmila loya khud media ke saamne aakar apni sthiti saaf karengi
 Caravan has written that the call for the information of the death went to the wife as well as to the sisters and also to the father
 bahan anuraadhaa ye bataati hai ki phone par koi barde the jo apane ko jaj bataate hai, unka phone aayaa tha
 Sister Sarita also tells that a judge named Barde called
 indian express kii report main barde kaa naam saaf ho jaataa he
 He is Judge Barde
 jaj barde ko express kii report main local jaj kaha gaya he or inkaa puraa naam he jaj vijay kumaar barde
 It is in the express that Rupesh Rathi, Deputy Registrar of Nagpur Bench of High Court and Barde Justice Loya take him to Dande Hospital in a car
 kairavaan main likhaa he ki do jaj aato main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 It is written in the express that two judges take Judge Loya in the car
 justise sunil shukre ne kaha he ki jaj barde car khud chalaa rahe the
 Justice Gavai told our colleague Sunil Singh that he was the Senior Administrative Justice in Nagpur at that time

 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 Prashant told ndtv's Manas that my uncle had reported the death of Judge Loya around six o'clock in the morning and that i immediately reached out to assist the family at the time of mourning
 dow prashanth rathi ne maanas se kaha ki ye ankal aurangabad main rahete hai or jaj loya ke kazin hai
 Rathi did not tell Manas that he had warts, used Uncle and cousin in English
 naam bhi nahin bataaya ki koun hai
 When we talk to the Rathi Express, it is clear that Moussa got a call and his name is Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia
 unka phone aata he ki unke kazin jaj loya meditrina aspataal main bhartee hai or mujhe loya kii madad ke liye kehete hai
 When i reach the hospital, the doctor says that he has died
 yah baat main apane ankal ko bataata hum
 Uncle asks me to take care of formalities
 ab aapane dekha ki prashanth rathi ek reporter se kehete hai ki ankal kaa phone aata he ki 6 baje loya kii maut ho gai he
 Loya tells a reporter that Loya is recruiting, help him
 aspataal jaakar pataa chalata he ki loya mar chuke hai
 Here is another question
 nagpur main doctor prashanth rathi hi akele sab manage kar rahe the to kya unase loya ke parivaar ke kisi kareebi ne baar-baar baat kii, jaanane ke liye ki kya ho rahaa he, shav kahaan le jayega
 Can Dr
 Rathi tell who was told by the family that the body will go to Gategaon, not Latur, to Mumbai
 dow prashanth rathi ne camere par baat karne se inkaar kar diya
 It is not clear how close Rathi's warts were to Jakotia judge Loya, was he talking to his father, was Anuradha talking to Biyani? Dr Prashant Rathi told Manas of NDTV that he had not seen the body of Judge Loya
 unhen ek chadar main lapeta gaya tha
 They just signed on
 kairavaan kii report main bahan anuraadhaa biyani nagpur main kisi rishtedaar kii baat karti hai magar naam nahin bataati hai
 There is no mention of Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia in their conversation, nor the name of Judge Loya's father
 prashanth rathi ne postmortem report main sin karte hue khud ko mritak kaa chachera bhai bataaya he
 From the father's side
 magar unke mausa jaj loya ko apana bhai bataate hai
 a wart's brother was like a wart
 to rathi ne khud ko loya kaa chachera bhai kaise bataa diya
 If i am right then Rathi Loya and Jakotia's nephew
 kya rukmesh pannalaal jakotia jaj loya kii patni, pita or bahan anuraadhaa ke sampark main the
 It is not clear from the report of the express that it was decided to send the dead body to Gategaon in place of Mumbai
 patni sharmila loya ko phone gaya tha to kya unhen pataa tha ki shav gaategaanv jayega, mumbai nahin aayega
 If his family lives around Latur, it may be a practical decision
 magar yahi nahin pataa chal rahaa he ki nagpur se gaategaanv le jane kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 This will be clear only when Sharmila Loya herself comes before the media and clarifies her position
 kairavaan ne yah to likhaa he ki maut kii soochna kaa phone patni ko bhi gaya, bahanon ko bhi or pita ko bhi
 Sister Anuradha says that there were some bards on the phone who call themselves judges, their call came
 bahan sarita bhi bataati hai ki barde naam ke jaj ne phone kiya tha
 The Indian Express report clears Barde's name
 ve jaj barde hai
 Judge Barde has been called a local judge in the report of the Express and his full name is Judge Vijay Kumar Barde
 express main he ki hoicourt ke nagpur bench ke dipti register rupesh rathi or barde justise loya ko dande aspataal lekar jate hai car main
 It is written in Caravan that two judges take Judge Loya in auto
 express main likhaa he ki do jaj car main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 Justice Sunil Shukre has said that Judge Barde was driving the car himself
 hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se justise gawai ne kaha ki ve us vakt nagpur main senior administrative justise the
 He also says from the Express that he, as a senior administrative judge, called him and then he reached Mediterina Hospital with his fellow judge Sunil Shukre
 apane dryver kaa bhi intazaar nahin kiya
 Both lived about a mile from Ravi Bhavan
 jaj ko lekar aspataal le jane main local jaj, dipti register, jaj kulkarani or jaj modak bhi the
 Justice Gavai has also told Sunil Singh that a total of five rooms were booked in Ravi Bhavan but at night all three preferred to stay in one room
 kyonki sabhi kii vaapasi kaa tikat ek hi saath kaa tha or agali subah mumbai lautnaa tha
 The two judges from Mumbai did not accompany the body because they were shocked by the death of the friend
 kairavaan main anuraadhaa biyani ne kaha he ki donon jaj dedh maheene tak parivaar se nahin mili
 Now you see that when Judge Loya's sisters questioned, Judge Sahiban was silent
 ab parivaar ke log chup hai to jaj sahiban apni baat rakh rahe hai
 The investigation has not been announced yet
 jaj loya ke bete ne tab ke chif justise ko patr likhaa tha ki mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 i do not have the strength to fight them
 hamaari zindagi khatare main he
 The son of a judge writes a letter to the Chief Justice
 maut ke 80 din baad
 This letter has been shown by Caravan magazine in its video
 is patr ke baad kya parivaar ko suraksha di gai, kyon nahin di gai? Manas of NDTV has stated in its report that there was no car designate for any judge in Ravi Bhavan
 yah baat ravi bhawan ke kuch staff ne maanas ko naam naa lene ke shart par bataai
 It should also be seen that the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly session was about to begin around the event
 kya us vakt ravi bhawan main koi ambulance thi
 All this investigation will reveal, not through media trials
 express main likhaa he ki jaj loya ne 4 baje seene main dard kii shikaayat kii lekin car se nikatom aspataal pahunchane main paune paanch baj jate hai
 What should take 45 minutes to cover the distance of three kilometers in the morning
 iskaa jawaab maaloom nahin he
 Now the question arises when Judge Loya got chest pain
 iske alag alag varjan hai
 In Caravan, Niranjan Takle has written that he had chest pain at 12:30
 anuraadhaa biyani ke anusaar donon jajon ne yah baat parivaar ko bataai thi
 According to Caravan, the post-mortem report said that there was pain at 4 o'clock and death at 6
15 o'clock
 indian express ko justise bhushan gawai ne bataaya ki jaj loya kii kareeb 4 baje tabiyat kharaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai from NDTV has said that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at 3:30 pm
 justise bhushan gawai ne hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se baat kii he
 In this context, Anuradha Biyani's statement becomes important that both the judges said that there was a chest problem at 12:30
 matlab justise modak or justise kulkarani ne
 But according to Justice Gavai, both went to the hospital in the morning with Judge Loya
 postmortem kii report kaa mahatv he magar aap jaanate hai ki is desh main postmortem kii report ke saath kya kya khilwaad ho jate hai
 This does not mean that this is what happened in this case, i am just referring for reference
 koun sahi bol rahaa he yah to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Do not doubt anyone unnecessarily
 sunil singh ne jab justise gawai se baat kii to ek or sawaal kaa jawaab mila
 According to him, only Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni went with Judge Loya
 gawai ke mutabik pehali baar ve shaadi main jaj loya se mili the
 According to him, the three people went out of the ceremony to eat Gokul Peth Paan
 teenon kaa matlab jaj loya, justise kulkarani or justise modak paan khaane gaye the
 Justice Gavai was called by the Deputy Registrar at six in the morning to inform Judge Loya's death, and then he went to the Meditrina Hospital where Justice Modak, Justice Kulakarni, Judge Barde and Deputy Registrar were present
 justise gawai isiu main gaye the or unke sharir par kahin koon ke nishaan nahin the
 Notice of death is everywhere at six o'clock
 jaj loya kii ek or bahan sarita ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se kaha he ki paanch baje jaj barde kaa phone aayaa tha ki brijagopal kii maut ho chuki he
 Whether a difference in time can be doubted, at least not in a media trial
 indian express kii report ke baad isiji kii chhapi hui tasviir ko lekar thodi sansani ho gai
 Brijgopal Lohia is written in the ECG report above and the date below is 30 November
 jabaki maut ek november ko hui he
 Does the ECG machine cause such a lapse
 aspataal ne is bare main kaha he ki 30 november kii jo taarikh dikh rahi he, wo takniki kharabi ho sakati he
 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai
 The ECG took place on December 1
 aspataal ne baad main express ko bataaya he jise express ne apni website par chapa he
 Whether there was a compliment on the report on that day, on 30 November, all this will be known only by investigation
 kuch logon ne isiji ko dekhakar kahana shuru kar diya ki isiji saamaanya he
 We spoke to two doctors but keep in mind a warning
 beemaari kaa pataa ek report se nahin chalata he, or ek report se bhi chalata he
 All these things should be under scrutiny, but now Caravan and Express have printed different versions, then we talked to two doctors
 anuraadhaa ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki dande haspital ke doctoron or karmchaariyon ne kya chikitsa kii gai iskaa koi vivaran dene se haspital ne inkaar kar diya, vahiin dande hospital ke nideshak pinaak dande ne express se baat kii he or byora diya
 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death , there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places
 koi bhi sawaal is baat ko thos rup se uthta nahin dikhaa ki kya jaj loya kii hatya kii gai hogi
 Many big judges were present during the post-mart
 iskaa vivaran kai tarah se sahi sabit hota he
 We had asked the question of whose decision the post-mart was, but you will get the answer to this question only through the process of law
 anuraadhaa biyani ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki doctor hone ke kaaran wo jaanati hai ki postmortem ke dauraan khun nahin nikalataa or biyani ne dobaaraa postmortem kii maang kii thi lekin vahaan ikatthe loya ke doston or sahakarmiyon ne unhen hatotsahit kiya ki yah kehete hue ki maamle ko or jatil banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Many officials say that blood does not come out at the time of postmart but our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar has given forensic expert Dr
 ke si sharma se baat kii
 He said the postmortem also happens without informing the family
 postmart hone ke baad kai baar kapadon main rakt lag jaataa he jiske kai kaaran hote hai
 The comments express or kairavaan main ek or kirdaar he
 Ishwar Bahati kairavaan main ise aresas kaa bataaya gaya he
 In the Express, these were Judge Loya's friends, Dr
 baheti kaa bhai bataaya gaya he or jaj loya ishwar baheti ke sampark main the
 But Baheti has not talked to Express and Caravan
 kam se kam unhen media se sampark karnaa chahie ki unke paas jaj loya kaa phone kaise aayaa, wo maut ke teen chaar dinon baad phone lekar kaise parivaar ke paas pahunch gaye, kya yah sahi he ki phone se data uda diya gaya tha, ek hi esemes bachaa tha
 Supreme Court lawyer Sudeep Srivastava has raised some questions
 bahut tarah ke sawaal hai jo ek duusare se takaraa rahe hai
 Whether the family members have said it will be proved by investigation, or it will be unilaterally dismissed from here or there through the statement
 mobile tower se pataa chal saktaa he ki koun jaj kahaan tak gaye the, koun kisase baat kar rahaa tha, loya ne kise phone kiya, patni ko kis number se phone gaya
 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 yahi rathi express se baat karte hai to saaf-saaf kehete hai ki mausa kaa phone aayaa or unka naam rukmesh pannalaal jakotia he
 He gets a call that his cousin Judge Loya is admitted to the Meditrina Hospital and asks me to help Loya
 jab main aspataal pahunchataa hum to doctor bataate hai ki unki maut ho chuki he
 i tell this to my uncle
 ankal mujhe aupchaariktaaon kaa dhyaan rakhane ke liye kehete hai
 Now you see that Prashant Rathi tells a reporter that Uncle's phone call that Loya has died at 6 o'clock
 ek reporter se kehete hai ki loya bhartee hai, unki madad karen
 Going to the hospital, he learns that Loya is dead
 yahaan ek or sawaal he
 In Nagpur, Dr
 Prashant Rathi was the only one managing all, so did someone close to Loya's family repeatedly talk to him, to know what is going on, where the body will be taken
 kya doctor rathi bataa sakate hai ki unase parivaar ke kisne kaha ki shav mumbai nahin, latur se sata gaategaanv jayega
 Dr
 Prashant Rathi refused to speak on camera
 yah saaf nahin he ki rathi ke mausa jakotia jaj loya ke kitne kareebi the, kya ve pita se baat kar rahe the, kya anuraadhaa biyani se baat kar rahe the? dow prashanth rathi ne enditivi ke maanas ko bataaya ki unhone jaj loya ke shav ko nahin dekha tha
 They were wrapped in a sheet
 bas unhone sin kar diya
 In Caravan's report, sister Anuradha Biyani talks about a relative in Nagpur but does not mention the name
 unki baatcheet main rukmesh pannalaal jakotia kaa koi zikr nahin he, na hi jaj loya ke pita ne naam liya he
 Prashant Rathi, signing the post-mortem report, described himself as the cousin of the deceased
 pita ke said se
 But his warts call Judge Loya his brother
 mausa kaa bhai to mausa ke baraabar hua
 So how did Rathi tell herself Loya's cousin
 agar main sahi hum to rathi loya or jakotia ke bhatija lagenge
 Was Rukmesh Pannalal Jakotia in touch with Judge Loya's wife, father and sister Anuradha
 express kii report se saaf nahin hota he ki shav mumbai kii jagah latur ke gaategaanv bhejne kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 If wife Sharmila Loya got a call, did she know that the body would go to Gategaon, not to Mumbai
 unka parivaar latur ke aas-paas rahata he to ho saktaa he ki yah vyaavhaarik faisla ho
 But it is not known whose decision it was to move from Nagpur to Gategaon
 yah tabhi saaf hoga jab sharmila loya khud media ke saamne aakar apni sthiti saaf karengi
 Caravan has written that the call for the information of the death went to the wife as well as to the sisters and also to the father
 bahan anuraadhaa ye bataati hai ki phone par koi barde the jo apane ko jaj bataate hai, unka phone aayaa tha
 Sister Sarita also tells that a judge named Barde called
 indian express kii report main barde kaa naam saaf ho jaataa he
 He is Judge Barde
 jaj barde ko express kii report main local jaj kaha gaya he or inkaa puraa naam he jaj vijay kumaar barde
 It is in the express that Rupesh Rathi, Deputy Registrar of Nagpur Bench of High Court and Barde Justice Loya take him to Dande Hospital in a car
 kairavaan main likhaa he ki do jaj aato main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 It is written in the express that two judges take Judge Loya in the car
 justise sunil shukre ne kaha he ki jaj barde car khud chalaa rahe the
 Justice Gavai told our colleague Sunil Singh that he was the Senior Administrative Justice in Nagpur at that time
 express se bhi vahi kehete hai ki varisht prashaskeey jaj hone ke naate unhen hi phone kiya or tab ve apane saathi jaj sunil shukre ko lekar meditirina aspatal pahunche
 Did not even wait for my driver
 donon ravi bhawan se ek mile kii duuri par rahete the
 Local judges, deputy registrars, judge Kulkarni and Judge Modak were also there to take the judge to the hospital
 justise gawai ne sunil singh ko yah bhi bataaya he ki ravi bhawan main kul paanch kamare book the magar raat main teenon ne ek hi kamare main rahanaa pansad kiya
 Because everyone's return ticket was the same and was to return to Mumbai the next morning
 mumbai se gaye donon jaj shav ke saath isliye nahin gaye kyonki ve dost kii maut ke sadame main the
 In Caravan, Anuradha Biyani has said that the two judges did not meet the family for a month and a half
 ab aap dekh rahe hai ki jab jaj loya kii bahanon ne sawaal kiya to jaj sahiban chup the
 Now the family members are silent, then Judge Sahiban is speaking
 jaanch kaa elaan abhi tak nahin hua he
 Judge Loya's son wrote a letter to the then Chief Justice saying that i am afraid that these leaders may harm any member of my family
 mere paas inase ladane kii takat nahin he
 Our life is in danger ek jaj kaa betaa chif justise ko patr likhata he
 80 days after death
 yah patr kairavaan patrika ne apane video main dikhaaya he
 After this letter, was the family given protection, why not? enditivi ke maanas ne apni report main kaha he ki ravi bhawan main kisi bhi jaj ke liye koi car desiganet nahin thi
 Some staff members of Ravi Bhavan told Manas on condition of anonymity
 yah bhi dekha janaa chahie ki ghatana ke aasapaas maharashtra vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hone vaala tha
 Was there any ambulance in Ravi Bhavan at that time
 yah sab jaanch se pataa chalegaa, media trial se nahin
 It is written in the express that Judge Loya complained of chest pain at 4 o'clock but it is a quarter past five to reach the nearest hospital by car
 subah ke vakt teen kilometre kaa faasla tay karne main kya 45 minute laganaa chahie
 The answer is not known
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jaj loya ko seene main kab dard hua
 It has different versions
 kairavaan main niranjan taakale ne likhaa he ki saadhe baarah baje seene main dard hua
 According to Anuradha Biyani, both the judges had told this to the family
 kairavaan ke anusaar postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki 4 baje dard hua or sava 6 baje maut hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai told the Indian Express that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at around 4 am
 enditivi se justise bhushan gawai ne kaha he ki saadhe teen baje jaj loya kii tabiyat karaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai has spoken to our colleague Sunil Singh
 is sandarbh main anuraadhaa biyani kaa bayaan mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki donon jajon ne bataaya ki saadhe baarah baje seene main takalif hui
 Meaning Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni
 magar justise gawai ke anusaar to donon subah ke vakt jaj loya ko lekar aspataal gaye the
 The report of the post-mortem is important but you know what messes with the post-mortem report in this country
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki is cese main yahi hua he, main bas sandarbh ke liye bataa rahaa hum
 Who is saying the right thing will be known only through investigation
 aap bhi kisi par bevajaah shaq na karen
 Another question was answered when Sunil Singh spoke to Justice Gavai
 unke anusaar justise modak or justise kulkarani hi jaj loya ke saath gaye the
 According to Gawai, he met Judge Loya for the first time in marriage
 unke mutabik samaaroh se nikalakar teenon log gokul peth paan khaane gaye the
 The trio meant Judge Loya, Justice Kulakarni and Justice Modak went to eat paan
 justise gawai ko subah chah baje dipti register ne phone kar jaj loya ke maut kii soochna di, or tab ve meditrina aspataal gaye jahaan par justise modak, justise kulkarani, jaj barde or dipti register maujuud the
 Justice Gavai went to the ICU and there were no blood stains on his body
 maut kii soochna har jagah chah baje hai
 Sarita, another sister of Judge Loya, has told Niranjan Takle of Caravan that at five o'clock Judge Barde got a call that Brijgopal had died
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG
 isiji kii report main upar brijagopal lohia likhaa he or neeche kii taarikh 30 november he
 While the death occurred on November 1
 kya isiji mashin se aisi chook ho jaati he
 The hospital has said about this that the date of November 30 is visible, it may be technical fault
 ham har teen maheene par apni mashin ko ri-calibratt karte hai taaki aisi chook na ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi bich-bich main aisi gadabadi ho jaati he
 We stand by our facts
 isiji disambar ek taarikh ko hui thi
 The hospital later revealed the express, which the Express has published on its website
 kya us rose or bhi report par 30 november kii tarif chhapi thi, ye sab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Some people started looking at ECG and started saying that ECG is normal
 hamane do doctoron se baat kii lekin ek chetavanee dhyaan main rakhiegaa
 The disease is not detected by a report, and also by a report
 yah sari baaten jaanch ke daayre main honi chahie magar ab kairavaan or express ne alag-alag varjan chaape hai to hamane do doctoron se baat kar lee
 Anuradha has told Caravan that the hospital and doctors at Dande Hospital refused to give any details of what was done, while Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, spoke to the Express and gave details
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar sawaal maut ke baad kii gatividhiyon ko lekar jo soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan ho rahaa he, usamen kai jagah samanta he, kai jagah antar he
 No question arises concretely as to whether Judge Loya would have been murdered
 postmart ke vakt kai bade jaj maujuud the
 Its description proves to be true in many ways
 hamane yah sawaal kiya tha ki postmart kaa faisla kiskaa tha, lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako kanoon kii prakriya se hi milegaa
 Anuradha Biyani has told Caravan that as a doctor she knows that blood does not come out during the post-mortem and Biyani again demanded a post-mortem but Loya's friends and colleagues gathered there discouraged her saying that the case No need to further complicate
 kai adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki postmart ke samay khun nahin nikalataa lekin hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger ne forensik export dow
 Talked to KC Sharma
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko suchit kiye bina bhi postmortem ho jaataa he
 After the post-mortem, there are many reasons why blood gets put into clothes due to many reasons
 tippaniyan Express and Caravan have another character
 ishwar baheti
 In the caravan it is described as RSS
 express main inhen jaj loya ke mitra dow
 Baheti's brother is said to be and Judge Loya was in contact with Ishwar Baheti
 magar baheti ne express or kairavaan se baat nahin kii he
 At least they should contact the media about how they got Judge Loya's phone, how he reached the family with the phone three to four days after his death, is it true that the data was blown out of the phone, the same SMS was saved
 supreme court ke vakil sudeep shrivastav ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 There are a wide variety of questions that clash with each other
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne jo kaha he kya use jaanch se sabit kiya jayega, yaa phir ekatarfa idhar se yaa udhar se bayaan ke zarie khaarij kar diya jayega
 From the mobile tower, we can know who the judge went to, who he was talking to, whom Loya called, who called the wife from
 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 Now you see that Prashant Rathi tells a reporter that Uncle's phone call that Loya has died at 6 o'clock

 yah bhi dekha janaa chahie ki ghatana ke aasapaas maharashtra vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hone vaala tha
 Was there any ambulance in Ravi Bhavan at that time
 yah sab jaanch se pataa chalegaa, media trial se nahin
 It is written in the express that Judge Loya complained of chest pain at 4 o'clock but it is a quarter past five to reach the nearest hospital by car
 subah ke vakt teen kilometre kaa faasla tay karne main kya 45 minute laganaa chahie
 The answer is not known
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jaj loya ko seene main kab dard hua
 It has different versions
 kairavaan main niranjan taakale ne likhaa he ki saadhe baarah baje seene main dard hua
 According to Anuradha Biyani, both the judges had told this to the family
 kairavaan ke anusaar postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki 4 baje dard hua or sava 6 baje maut hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai told the Indian Express that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at around 4 am
 enditivi se justise bhushan gawai ne kaha he ki saadhe teen baje jaj loya kii tabiyat karaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai has spoken to our colleague Sunil Singh
 is sandarbh main anuraadhaa biyani kaa bayaan mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki donon jajon ne bataaya ki saadhe baarah baje seene main takalif hui
 Meaning Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni
 magar justise gawai ke anusaar to donon subah ke vakt jaj loya ko lekar aspataal gaye the
 The report of the post-mortem is important but you know what messes with the post-mortem report in this country
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki is cese main yahi hua he, main bas sandarbh ke liye bataa rahaa hum
 Who is saying the right thing will be known only through investigation
 aap bhi kisi par bevajaah shaq na karen
 Another question was answered when Sunil Singh spoke to Justice Gavai
 unke anusaar justise modak or justise kulkarani hi jaj loya ke saath gaye the
 According to Gawai, he met Judge Loya for the first time in marriage
 unke mutabik samaaroh se nikalakar teenon log gokul peth paan khaane gaye the
 The trio meant Judge Loya, Justice Kulakarni and Justice Modak went to eat paan
 justise gawai ko subah chah baje dipti register ne phone kar jaj loya ke maut kii soochna di, or tab ve meditrina aspataal gaye jahaan par justise modak, justise kulkarani, jaj barde or dipti register maujuud the
 Justice Gavai went to the ICU and there were no blood stains on his body
 maut kii soochna har jagah chah baje hai
 Sarita, another sister of Judge Loya, has told Niranjan Takle of Caravan that at five o'clock Judge Barde got a call that Brijgopal had died
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG
 isiji kii report main upar brijagopal lohia likhaa he or neeche kii taarikh 30 november he
 While the death occurred on November 1
 kya isiji mashin se aisi chook ho jaati he
 The hospital has said about this that the date of November 30 is visible, it may be technical fault
 ham har teen maheene par apni mashin ko ri-calibratt karte hai taaki aisi chook na ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi bich-bich main aisi gadabadi ho jaati he
 We stand by our facts
 isiji disambar ek taarikh ko hui thi
 The hospital later revealed the express, which the Express has published on its website
 kya us rose or bhi report par 30 november kii tarif chhapi thi, ye sab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Some people started looking at ECG and started saying that ECG is normal
 hamane do doctoron se baat kii lekin ek chetavanee dhyaan main rakhiegaa
 The disease is not detected by a report, and also by a report
 yah sari baaten jaanch ke daayre main honi chahie magar ab kairavaan or express ne alag-alag varjan chaape hai to hamane do doctoron se baat kar lee
 Anuradha has told Caravan that the hospital and doctors at Dande Hospital refused to give any details of what was done, while Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, spoke to the Express and gave details
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar sawaal maut ke baad kii gatividhiyon ko lekar jo soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan ho rahaa he, usamen kai jagah samanta he, kai jagah antar he
 No question arises concretely as to whether Judge Loya would have been murdered
 postmart ke vakt kai bade jaj maujuud the
 Its description proves to be true in many ways
 hamane yah sawaal kiya tha ki postmart kaa faisla kiskaa tha, lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako kanoon kii prakriya se hi milegaa
 Anuradha Biyani has told Caravan that as a doctor she knows that blood does not come out during the post-mortem and Biyani again demanded a post-mortem but Loya's friends and colleagues gathered there discouraged her saying that the case No need to further complicate
 kai adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki postmart ke samay khun nahin nikalataa lekin hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger ne forensik export dow
 Talked to KC Sharma
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko suchit kiye bina bhi postmortem ho jaataa he
 After the post-mortem, there are many reasons why blood gets put into clothes due to many reasons
 tippaniyan Express and Caravan have another character
 ishwar baheti
 In the caravan it is described as RSS
 express main inhen jaj loya ke mitra dow
 Baheti's brother is said to be and Judge Loya was in contact with Ishwar Baheti
 magar baheti ne express or kairavaan se baat nahin kii he
 At least they should contact the media about how they got Judge Loya's phone, how he reached the family with the phone three to four days after his death, is it true that the data was blown out of the phone, the same SMS was saved
 supreme court ke vakil sudeep shrivastav ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 There are a wide variety of questions that clash with each other
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne jo kaha he kya use jaanch se sabit kiya jayega, yaa phir ekatarfa idhar se yaa udhar se bayaan ke zarie khaarij kar diya jayega
 From the mobile tower, we can know who the judge went to, who he was talking to, whom Loya called, who called the wife from
 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 It is not clear from the report of the express that it was decided to send the dead body to Gategaon in place of Mumbai
 patni sharmila loya ko phone gaya tha to kya unhen pataa tha ki shav gaategaanv jayega, mumbai nahin aayega
 If his family lives around Latur, it may be a practical decision
 magar yahi nahin pataa chal rahaa he ki nagpur se gaategaanv le jane kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 This will be clear only when Sharmila Loya herself comes before the media and clarifies her position
 kairavaan ne yah to likhaa he ki maut kii soochna kaa phone patni ko bhi gaya, bahanon ko bhi or pita ko bhi
 Sister Anuradha says that there were some bards on the phone who call themselves judges, their call came
 bahan sarita bhi bataati hai ki barde naam ke jaj ne phone kiya tha
 The Indian Express report clears Barde's name
 ve jaj barde hai
 Judge Barde has been called a local judge in the report of the Express and his full name is Judge Vijay Kumar Barde
 express main he ki hoicourt ke nagpur bench ke dipti register rupesh rathi or barde justise loya ko dande aspataal lekar jate hai car main
 It is written in Caravan that two judges take Judge Loya in auto
 express main likhaa he ki do jaj car main jaj loya ko lekar jate hai
 Justice Sunil Shukre has said that Judge Barde was driving the car himself
 hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se justise gawai ne kaha ki ve us vakt nagpur main senior administrative justise the
 He also says from the Express that he, as a senior administrative judge, called him and then he reached Mediterina Hospital with his fellow judge Sunil Shukre
 apane dryver kaa bhi intazaar nahin kiya
 Both lived about a mile from Ravi Bhavan
 jaj ko lekar aspataal le jane main local jaj, dipti register, jaj kulkarani or jaj modak bhi the
 Justice Gavai has also told Sunil Singh that a total of five rooms were booked in Ravi Bhavan but at night all three preferred to stay in one room
 kyonki sabhi kii vaapasi kaa tikat ek hi saath kaa tha or agali subah mumbai lautnaa tha
 The two judges from Mumbai did not accompany the body because they were shocked by the death of the friend
 kairavaan main anuraadhaa biyani ne kaha he ki donon jaj dedh maheene tak parivaar se nahin mili
 Now you see that when Judge Loya's sisters questioned, Judge Sahiban was silent
 ab parivaar ke log chup hai to jaj sahiban apni baat rakh rahe hai
 The investigation has not been announced yet
 jaj loya ke bete ne tab ke chif justise ko patr likhaa tha ki mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 i do not have the strength to fight them
 hamaari zindagi khatare main he
 The son of a judge writes a letter to the Chief Justice
 maut ke 80 din baad
 This letter has been shown by Caravan magazine in its video
 is patr ke baad kya parivaar ko suraksha di gai, kyon nahin di gai? Manas of NDTV has stated in its report that there was no car designate for any judge in Ravi Bhavan
 yah baat ravi bhawan ke kuch staff ne maanas ko naam naa lene ke shart par bataai
 It should also be seen that the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly session was about to begin around the event
 kya us vakt ravi bhawan main koi ambulance thi
 All this investigation will reveal, not through media trials
 express main likhaa he ki jaj loya ne 4 baje seene main dard kii shikaayat kii lekin car se nikatom aspataal pahunchane main paune paanch baj jate hai
 What should take 45 minutes to cover the distance of three kilometers in the morning
 iskaa jawaab maaloom nahin he
 Now the question arises when Judge Loya got chest pain
 iske alag alag varjan hai
 In Caravan, Niranjan Takle has written that he had chest pain at 12:30
 anuraadhaa biyani ke anusaar donon jajon ne yah baat parivaar ko bataai thi
 According to Caravan, the post-mortem report said that there was pain at 4 o'clock and death at 6
15 o'clock
 indian express ko justise bhushan gawai ne bataaya ki jaj loya kii kareeb 4 baje tabiyat kharaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai from NDTV has said that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at 3:30 pm
 justise bhushan gawai ne hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se baat kii he
 In this context, Anuradha Biyani's statement becomes important that both the judges said that there was a chest problem at 12:30
 matlab justise modak or justise kulkarani ne
 But according to Justice Gavai, both went to the hospital in the morning with Judge Loya
 postmortem kii report kaa mahatv he magar aap jaanate hai ki is desh main postmortem kii report ke saath kya kya khilwaad ho jate hai
 This does not mean that this is what happened in this case, i am just referring for reference
 koun sahi bol rahaa he yah to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Do not doubt anyone unnecessarily
 sunil singh ne jab justise gawai se baat kii to ek or sawaal kaa jawaab mila
 According to him, only Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni went with Judge Loya
 gawai ke mutabik pehali baar ve shaadi main jaj loya se mili the
 According to him, the three people went out of the ceremony to eat Gokul Peth Paan
 teenon kaa matlab jaj loya, justise kulkarani or justise modak paan khaane gaye the
 Justice Gavai was called by the Deputy Registrar at six in the morning to inform Judge Loya's death, and then he went to the Meditrina Hospital where Justice Modak, Justice Kulakarni, Judge Barde and Deputy Registrar were present
 justise gawai isiu main gaye the or unke sharir par kahin koon ke nishaan nahin the
 Notice of death is everywhere at six o'clock
 jaj loya kii ek or bahan sarita ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se kaha he ki paanch baje jaj barde kaa phone aayaa tha ki brijagopal kii maut ho chuki he
 Whether a difference in time can be doubted, at least not in a media trial
 indian express kii report ke baad isiji kii chhapi hui tasviir ko lekar thodi sansani ho gai
 Brijgopal Lohia is written in the ECG report above and the date below is 30 November
 jabaki maut ek november ko hui he
 Does the ECG machine cause such a lapse
 aspataal ne is bare main kaha he ki 30 november kii jo taarikh dikh rahi he, wo takniki kharabi ho sakati he
 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai
 The ECG took place on December 1
 aspataal ne baad main express ko bataaya he jise express ne apni website par chapa he
 Whether there was a compliment on the report on that day, on 30 November, all this will be known only by investigation
 kuch logon ne isiji ko dekhakar kahana shuru kar diya ki isiji saamaanya he
 We spoke to two doctors but keep in mind a warning
 beemaari kaa pataa ek report se nahin chalata he, or ek report se bhi chalata he
 All these things should be under scrutiny, but now Caravan and Express have printed different versions, then we talked to two doctors
 anuraadhaa ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki dande haspital ke doctoron or karmchaariyon ne kya chikitsa kii gai iskaa koi vivaran dene se haspital ne inkaar kar diya, vahiin dande hospital ke nideshak pinaak dande ne express se baat kii he or byora diya
 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death, there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places
 koi bhi sawaal is baat ko thos rup se uthta nahin dikhaa ki kya jaj loya kii hatya kii gai hogi
 Many big judges were present during the post-mart
 iskaa vivaran kai tarah se sahi sabit hota he
 We had asked the question of whose decision the post-mart was, but you will get the answer to this question only through the process of law
 anuraadhaa biyani ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki doctor hone ke kaaran wo jaanati hai ki postmortem ke dauraan khun nahin nikalataa or biyani ne dobaaraa postmortem kii maang kii thi lekin vahaan ikatthe loya ke doston or sahakarmiyon ne unhen hatotsahit kiya ki yah kehete hue ki maamle ko or jatil banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Many officials say that blood does not come out at the time of postmart but our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar has given forensic expert Dr
 ke si sharma se baat kii
 He said the postmortem also happens without informing the family
 postmart hone ke baad kai baar kapadon main rakt lag jaataa he jiske kai kaaran hote hai
 The comments express or kairavaan main ek or kirdaar he
 Ishwar Bahati kairavaan main ise aresas kaa bataaya gaya he
 In the Express, these were Judge Loya's friends, Dr
 baheti kaa bhai bataaya gaya he or jaj loya ishwar baheti ke sampark main the
 But Baheti has not talked to Express and Caravan
 kam se kam unhen media se sampark karnaa chahie ki unke paas jaj loya kaa phone kaise aayaa, wo maut ke teen chaar dinon baad phone lekar kaise parivaar ke paas pahunch gaye, kya yah sahi he ki phone se data uda diya gaya tha, ek hi esemes bachaa tha
 Supreme Court lawyer Sudeep Srivastava has raised some questions
 bahut tarah ke sawaal hai jo ek duusare se takaraa rahe hai
 Whether the family members have said it will be proved by investigation, or it will be unilaterally dismissed from here or there through the statement
 mobile tower se pataa chal saktaa he ki koun jaj kahaan tak gaye the, koun kisase baat kar rahaa tha, loya ne kise phone kiya, patni ko kis number se phone gaya
 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 kairavaan ne yah to likhaa he ki maut kii soochna kaa phone patni ko bhi gaya, bahanon ko bhi or pita ko bhi

 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai
 The ECG took place on December 1
 aspataal ne baad main express ko bataaya he jise express ne apni website par chapa he
 Whether there was a compliment on the report on that day, on 30 November, all this will be known only by investigation
 kuch logon ne isiji ko dekhakar kahana shuru kar diya ki isiji saamaanya he
 We spoke to two doctors but keep in mind a warning
 beemaari kaa pataa ek report se nahin chalata he, or ek report se bhi chalata he
 All these things should be under scrutiny, but now Caravan and Express have printed different versions, then we talked to two doctors
 anuraadhaa ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki dande haspital ke doctoron or karmchaariyon ne kya chikitsa kii gai iskaa koi vivaran dene se haspital ne inkaar kar diya, vahiin dande hospital ke nideshak pinaak dande ne express se baat kii he or byora diya
 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death, there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places
 koi bhi sawaal is baat ko thos rup se uthta nahin dikhaa ki kya jaj loya kii hatya kii gai hogi
 Many big judges were present during the post-mart
 iskaa vivaran kai tarah se sahi sabit hota he
 We had asked the question of whose decision the post-mart was, but you will get the answer to this question only through the process of law
 anuraadhaa biyani ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki doctor hone ke kaaran wo jaanati hai ki postmortem ke dauraan khun nahin nikalataa or biyani ne dobaaraa postmortem kii maang kii thi lekin vahaan ikatthe loya ke doston or sahakarmiyon ne unhen hatotsahit kiya ki yah kehete hue ki maamle ko or jatil banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Many officials say that blood does not come out at the time of postmart but our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar has given forensic expert Dr
 ke si sharma se baat kii
 He said the postmortem also happens without informing the family
 postmart hone ke baad kai baar kapadon main rakt lag jaataa he jiske kai kaaran hote hai
 The comments express or kairavaan main ek or kirdaar he
 Ishwar Bahati kairavaan main ise aresas kaa bataaya gaya he
 In the Express, these were Judge Loya's friends, Dr
 baheti kaa bhai bataaya gaya he or jaj loya ishwar baheti ke sampark main the
 But Baheti has not talked to Express and Caravan
 kam se kam unhen media se sampark karnaa chahie ki unke paas jaj loya kaa phone kaise aayaa, wo maut ke teen chaar dinon baad phone lekar kaise parivaar ke paas pahunch gaye, kya yah sahi he ki phone se data uda diya gaya tha, ek hi esemes bachaa tha
 Supreme Court lawyer Sudeep Srivastava has raised some questions
 bahut tarah ke sawaal hai jo ek duusare se takaraa rahe hai
 Whether the family members have said it will be proved by investigation, or it will be unilaterally dismissed from here or there through the statement
 mobile tower se pataa chal saktaa he ki koun jaj kahaan tak gaye the, koun kisase baat kar rahaa tha, loya ne kise phone kiya, patni ko kis number se phone gaya
 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 kairavaan main anuraadhaa biyani ne kaha he ki donon jaj dedh maheene tak parivaar se nahin mili
 Now you see that when Judge Loya's sisters questioned, Judge Sahiban was silent
 ab parivaar ke log chup hai to jaj sahiban apni baat rakh rahe hai
 The investigation has not been announced yet
 jaj loya ke bete ne tab ke chif justise ko patr likhaa tha ki mujhe dar he ki ye netaa mere parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 i do not have the strength to fight them
 hamaari zindagi khatare main he
 The son of a judge writes a letter to the Chief Justice
 maut ke 80 din baad
 This letter has been shown by Caravan magazine in its video
 is patr ke baad kya parivaar ko suraksha di gai, kyon nahin di gai? Manas of NDTV has stated in its report that there was no car designate for any judge in Ravi Bhavan
 yah baat ravi bhawan ke kuch staff ne maanas ko naam naa lene ke shart par bataai
 It should also be seen that the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly session was about to begin around the event
 kya us vakt ravi bhawan main koi ambulance thi
 All this investigation will reveal, not through media trials
 express main likhaa he ki jaj loya ne 4 baje seene main dard kii shikaayat kii lekin car se nikatom aspataal pahunchane main paune paanch baj jate hai
 What should take 45 minutes to cover the distance of three kilometers in the morning
 iskaa jawaab maaloom nahin he
 Now the question arises when Judge Loya got chest pain
 iske alag alag varjan hai
 In Caravan, Niranjan Takle has written that he had chest pain at 12:30
 anuraadhaa biyani ke anusaar donon jajon ne yah baat parivaar ko bataai thi
 According to Caravan, the post-mortem report said that there was pain at 4 o'clock and death at 6
15 o'clock
 indian express ko justise bhushan gawai ne bataaya ki jaj loya kii kareeb 4 baje tabiyat kharaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai from NDTV has said that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at 3:30 pm
 justise bhushan gawai ne hamaare sahyogi sunil singh se baat kii he
 In this context, Anuradha Biyani's statement becomes important that both the judges said that there was a chest problem at 12:30
 matlab justise modak or justise kulkarani ne
 But according to Justice Gavai, both went to the hospital in the morning with Judge Loya
 postmortem kii report kaa mahatv he magar aap jaanate hai ki is desh main postmortem kii report ke saath kya kya khilwaad ho jate hai
 This does not mean that this is what happened in this case, i am just referring for reference
 koun sahi bol rahaa he yah to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Do not doubt anyone unnecessarily
 sunil singh ne jab justise gawai se baat kii to ek or sawaal kaa jawaab mila
 According to him, only Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni went with Judge Loya
 gawai ke mutabik pehali baar ve shaadi main jaj loya se mili the
 According to him, the three people went out of the ceremony to eat Gokul Peth Paan
 teenon kaa matlab jaj loya, justise kulkarani or justise modak paan khaane gaye the
 Justice Gavai was called by the Deputy Registrar at six in the morning to inform Judge Loya's death, and then he went to the Meditrina Hospital where Justice Modak, Justice Kulakarni, Judge Barde and Deputy Registrar were present
 justise gawai isiu main gaye the or unke sharir par kahin koon ke nishaan nahin the
 Notice of death is everywhere at six o'clock
 jaj loya kii ek or bahan sarita ne kairavaan ke niranjan taakale se kaha he ki paanch baje jaj barde kaa phone aayaa tha ki brijagopal kii maut ho chuki he
 Whether a difference in time can be doubted, at least not in a media trial
 indian express kii report ke baad isiji kii chhapi hui tasviir ko lekar thodi sansani ho gai
 Brijgopal Lohia is written in the ECG report above and the date below is 30 November
 jabaki maut ek november ko hui he
 Does the ECG machine cause such a lapse
 aspataal ne is bare main kaha he ki 30 november kii jo taarikh dikh rahi he, wo takniki kharabi ho sakati he
 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai

 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death, there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places

 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 enditivi ke maanas ne apni report main kaha he ki ravi bhawan main kisi bhi jaj ke liye koi car desiganet nahin thi
 Some staff members of Ravi Bhavan told Manas on condition of anonymity
 yah bhi dekha janaa chahie ki ghatana ke aasapaas maharashtra vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hone vaala tha
 Was there any ambulance in Ravi Bhavan at that time
 yah sab jaanch se pataa chalegaa, media trial se nahin
 It is written in the express that Judge Loya complained of chest pain at 4 o'clock but it is a quarter past five to reach the nearest hospital by car
 subah ke vakt teen kilometre kaa faasla tay karne main kya 45 minute laganaa chahie
 The answer is not known
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jaj loya ko seene main kab dard hua
 It has different versions
 kairavaan main niranjan taakale ne likhaa he ki saadhe baarah baje seene main dard hua
 According to Anuradha Biyani, both the judges had told this to the family
 kairavaan ke anusaar postmortem report main kaha gaya he ki 4 baje dard hua or sava 6 baje maut hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai told the Indian Express that Judge Loya's health deteriorated at around 4 am
 enditivi se justise bhushan gawai ne kaha he ki saadhe teen baje jaj loya kii tabiyat karaab hui
 Justice Bhushan Gavai has spoken to our colleague Sunil Singh
 is sandarbh main anuraadhaa biyani kaa bayaan mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki donon jajon ne bataaya ki saadhe baarah baje seene main takalif hui
 Meaning Justice Modak and Justice Kulakarni
 magar justise gawai ke anusaar to donon subah ke vakt jaj loya ko lekar aspataal gaye the
 The report of the post-mortem is important but you know what messes with the post-mortem report in this country
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki is cese main yahi hua he, main bas sandarbh ke liye bataa rahaa hum
 Who is saying the right thing will be known only through investigation
 aap bhi kisi par bevajaah shaq na karen
 Another question was answered when Sunil Singh spoke to Justice Gavai
 unke anusaar justise modak or justise kulkarani hi jaj loya ke saath gaye the
 According to Gawai, he met Judge Loya for the first time in marriage
 unke mutabik samaaroh se nikalakar teenon log gokul peth paan khaane gaye the
 The trio meant Judge Loya, Justice Kulakarni and Justice Modak went to eat paan
 justise gawai ko subah chah baje dipti register ne phone kar jaj loya ke maut kii soochna di, or tab ve meditrina aspataal gaye jahaan par justise modak, justise kulkarani, jaj barde or dipti register maujuud the
 Justice Gavai went to the ICU and there were no blood stains on his body
 maut kii soochna har jagah chah baje hai
 Sarita, another sister of Judge Loya, has told Niranjan Takle of Caravan that at five o'clock Judge Barde got a call that Brijgopal had died
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG
 isiji kii report main upar brijagopal lohia likhaa he or neeche kii taarikh 30 november he
 While the death occurred on November 1
 kya isiji mashin se aisi chook ho jaati he
 The hospital has said about this that the date of November 30 is visible, it may be technical fault
 ham har teen maheene par apni mashin ko ri-calibratt karte hai taaki aisi chook na ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi bich-bich main aisi gadabadi ho jaati he
 We stand by our facts
 isiji disambar ek taarikh ko hui thi
 The hospital later revealed the express, which the Express has published on its website
 kya us rose or bhi report par 30 november kii tarif chhapi thi, ye sab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Some people started looking at ECG and started saying that ECG is normal
 hamane do doctoron se baat kii lekin ek chetavanee dhyaan main rakhiegaa
 The disease is not detected by a report, and also by a report
 yah sari baaten jaanch ke daayre main honi chahie magar ab kairavaan or express ne alag-alag varjan chaape hai to hamane do doctoron se baat kar lee
 Anuradha has told Caravan that the hospital and doctors at Dande Hospital refused to give any details of what was done, while Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, spoke to the Express and gave details
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar sawaal maut ke baad kii gatividhiyon ko lekar jo soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan ho rahaa he, usamen kai jagah samanta he, kai jagah antar he
 No question arises concretely as to whether Judge Loya would have been murdered
 postmart ke vakt kai bade jaj maujuud the
 Its description proves to be true in many ways
 hamane yah sawaal kiya tha ki postmart kaa faisla kiskaa tha, lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako kanoon kii prakriya se hi milegaa
 Anuradha Biyani has told Caravan that as a doctor she knows that blood does not come out during the post-mortem and Biyani again demanded a post-mortem but Loya's friends and colleagues gathered there discouraged her saying that the case No need to further complicate
 kai adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki postmart ke samay khun nahin nikalataa lekin hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger ne forensik export dow
 Talked to KC Sharma
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko suchit kiye bina bhi postmortem ho jaataa he
 After the post-mortem, there are many reasons why blood gets put into clothes due to many reasons
 tippaniyan Express and Caravan have another character
 ishwar baheti
 In the caravan it is described as RSS
 express main inhen jaj loya ke mitra dow
 Baheti's brother is said to be and Judge Loya was in contact with Ishwar Baheti
 magar baheti ne express or kairavaan se baat nahin kii he
 At least they should contact the media about how they got Judge Loya's phone, how he reached the family with the phone three to four days after his death, is it true that the data was blown out of the phone, the same SMS was saved
 supreme court ke vakil sudeep shrivastav ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 There are a wide variety of questions that clash with each other
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne jo kaha he kya use jaanch se sabit kiya jayega, yaa phir ekatarfa idhar se yaa udhar se bayaan ke zarie khaarij kar diya jayega
 From the mobile tower, we can know who the judge went to, who he was talking to, whom Loya called, who called the wife from
 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 It should also be seen that the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly session was about to begin around the event
 kya us vakt ravi bhawan main koi ambulance thi
 All this investigation will reveal, not through media trials

 indian express kii report ke baad isiji kii chhapi hui tasviir ko lekar thodi sansani ho gai
 Brijgopal Lohia is written in the ECG report above and the date below is 30 November
 jabaki maut ek november ko hui he
 Does the ECG machine cause such a lapse
 aspataal ne is bare main kaha he ki 30 november kii jo taarikh dikh rahi he, wo takniki kharabi ho sakati he
 We re-calibrate our machine every three months so that such omissions do not happen, but sometimes such disturbances occur in between
 ham apane tathy par kaayam hai
 The ECG took place on December 1
 aspataal ne baad main express ko bataaya he jise express ne apni website par chapa he
 Whether there was a compliment on the report on that day, on 30 November, all this will be known only by investigation
 kuch logon ne isiji ko dekhakar kahana shuru kar diya ki isiji saamaanya he
 We spoke to two doctors but keep in mind a warning
 beemaari kaa pataa ek report se nahin chalata he, or ek report se bhi chalata he
 All these things should be under scrutiny, but now Caravan and Express have printed different versions, then we talked to two doctors

 You will see that most of the questions are being shared about the activities after death, there is similarity in many places, there is difference in many places
 koi bhi sawaal is baat ko thos rup se uthta nahin dikhaa ki kya jaj loya kii hatya kii gai hogi
 Many big judges were present during the post-mart
 iskaa vivaran kai tarah se sahi sabit hota he
 We had asked the question of whose decision the post-mart was, but you will get the answer to this question only through the process of law
 anuraadhaa biyani ne kairavaan ko bataaya he ki doctor hone ke kaaran wo jaanati hai ki postmortem ke dauraan khun nahin nikalataa or biyani ne dobaaraa postmortem kii maang kii thi lekin vahaan ikatthe loya ke doston or sahakarmiyon ne unhen hatotsahit kiya ki yah kehete hue ki maamle ko or jatil banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Many officials say that blood does not come out at the time of postmart but our colleague Mukesh Singh Sengar has given forensic expert Dr

 He said the postmortem also happens without informing the family
 postmart hone ke baad kai baar kapadon main rakt lag jaataa he jiske kai kaaran hote hai
 The comments express or kairavaan main ek or kirdaar he
 Ishwar Bahati kairavaan main ise aresas kaa bataaya gaya he
 In the Express, these were Judge Loya's friends, Dr
 baheti kaa bhai bataaya gaya he or jaj loya ishwar baheti ke sampark main the
 But Baheti has not talked to Express and Caravan
 kam se kam unhen media se sampark karnaa chahie ki unke paas jaj loya kaa phone kaise aayaa, wo maut ke teen chaar dinon baad phone lekar kaise parivaar ke paas pahunch gaye, kya yah sahi he ki phone se data uda diya gaya tha, ek hi esemes bachaa tha
 Supreme Court lawyer Sudeep Srivastava has raised some questions
 bahut tarah ke sawaal hai jo ek duusare se takaraa rahe hai
 Whether the family members have said it will be proved by investigation, or it will be unilaterally dismissed from here or there through the statement
 mobile tower se pataa chal saktaa he ki koun jaj kahaan tak gaye the, koun kisase baat kar rahaa tha, loya ne kise phone kiya, patni ko kis number se phone gaya
 But all this can be revealed only by investigation when the facts and witnesses will be produced
 justise gawai ko subah chah baje dipti register ne phone kar jaj loya ke maut kii soochna di, or tab ve meditrina aspataal gaye jahaan par justise modak, justise kulkarani, jaj barde or dipti register maujuud the
 Justice Gavai went to the ICU and there were no blood stains on his body
 maut kii soochna har jagah chah baje hai
 Sarita, another sister of Judge Loya, has told Niranjan Takle of Caravan that at five o'clock Judge Barde got a call that Brijgopal had died
 kya samay main antar ko lekar shaq kiya ja saktaa he, kam se kam media trial main nahin hona chahie
 After the report of Indian Express, there was some sensation about the printed picture of ECG
 isiji kii report main upar brijagopal lohia likhaa he or neeche kii taarikh 30 november he
 While the death occurred on November 1
 kya isiji mashin se aisi chook ho jaati he
 The hospital has said about this that the date of November 30 is visible, it may be technical fault
 ham har teen maheene par apni mashin ko ri-calibratt karte hai taaki aisi chook na ho, lekin kabhi-kabhi bich-bich main aisi gadabadi ho jaati he
 We stand by our facts
 isiji disambar ek taarikh ko hui thi
 The hospital later revealed the express, which the Express has published on its website
 kya us rose or bhi report par 30 november kii tarif chhapi thi, ye sab to jaanch se hi pataa chalegaa
 Some people started looking at ECG and started saying that ECG is normal
 hamane do doctoron se baat kii lekin ek chetavanee dhyaan main rakhiegaa
 The disease is not detected by a report, and also by a report
 yah sari baaten jaanch ke daayre main honi chahie magar ab kairavaan or express ne alag-alag varjan chaape hai to hamane do doctoron se baat kar lee
 Anuradha has told Caravan that the hospital and doctors at Dande Hospital refused to give any details of what was done, while Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, spoke to the Express and gave details
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar sawaal maut ke baad kii gatividhiyon ko lekar jo soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan ho rahaa he, usamen kai jagah samanta he, kai jagah antar he
 No question arises concretely as to whether Judge Loya would have been murdered
 postmart ke vakt kai bade jaj maujuud the
 Its description proves to be true in many ways
 hamane yah sawaal kiya tha ki postmart kaa faisla kiskaa tha, lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako kanoon kii prakriya se hi milegaa
 Anuradha Biyani has told Caravan that as a doctor she knows that blood does not come out during the post-mortem and Biyani again demanded a post-mortem but Loya's friends and colleagues gathered there discouraged her saying that the case No need to further complicate
 kai adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki postmart ke samay khun nahin nikalataa lekin hamaare sahyogi mukesh singh senger ne forensik export dow
 Talked to KC Sharma
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ko suchit kiye bina bhi postmortem ho jaataa he
 After the post-mortem, there are many reasons why blood gets put into clothes due to many reasons
 tippaniyan Express and Caravan have another character
 ishwar baheti
 In the caravan it is described as RSS
 express main inhen jaj loya ke mitra dow
 Baheti's brother is said to be and Judge Loya was in contact with Ishwar Baheti
 magar baheti ne express or kairavaan se baat nahin kii he
 At least they should contact the media about how they got Judge Loya's phone, how he reached the family with the phone three to four days after his death, is it true that the data was blown out of the phone, the same SMS was saved
 supreme court ke vakil sudeep shrivastav ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai
 There are a wide variety of questions that clash with each other
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne jo kaha he kya use jaanch se sabit kiya jayega, yaa phir ekatarfa idhar se yaa udhar se bayaan ke zarie khaarij kar diya jayega
 From the mobile tower, we can know who the judge went to, who he was talking to, whom Loya called, who called the wife from
 magar ye sab to jaanch se hi saamne aa sakegaa jab tathy or gavaahon kii peshi hogi
 Whether a difference in time can be doubted, at least not in a media trial

 rajdhani dilli main hawa kii gunvattta sudhaarney ke liye arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party sarkaar ne 4 se 15 november tak od-ivan lagu kiya
 This is the third time in the tenure of this government when aud-even has been implemented to reduce air pollution
 od-ivan lagu karke sadakon par vaahanon kii sankhya kam karke sarkaar yah ummid karti he ki isse pradooshan kam hoga
 However, the figures tell some other story
 india today kii data intelegence unit (DIU) ne od-ivan lagu hone ke dauraan air quality index kaa vishleshan kiya or paaya ki pehle ke prayaason kii tarah hi is baar bhi od-ivan yojana se dilli kii hawa kii gunvattta sudhaarney main koi madad nahin mili
 DIU took the data between 4 am and 8 pm on November 4-15 and compared these figures with the figures for the same period in November 2018 when aud-even was not applicable
 ye sabhi aankade kendriya pradooshan niyantran board (CPCB) ke rashtriya air quality index ke hai
 Analysis of data from AQI revealed that there was no improvement in Delhi's air quality during the implementation of audi-even this year
 4 se 15 november ke bich kaa ausat AQI 362 rahaa
 The average AQI for the same period in 2018 when aud-even was not in force was 335
 sidhe shabdon main kahen to od-ivan lagu hone ke dauraan dilli kii hawa kii gunvattta pichley saal kii tulana main 8 pratishat zyada kharaab rahi
 Sold to CPCB standards, air quality falls into the 'very poor' category if AQI is above 300, and breathing in such air for long periods of time can cause respiratory diseases
 kya diwali or paraali hai pradooshan kii vajahen?dilli ne mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha he ki uttar bharat main hawa kii gunvattta kharaab hone kaa paraali jalaane se 'gaharaa sambandh' he
 DIU observed that the reduction in stubble burning has been recorded during this time when the aud-even was in force as compared to the same period last year
 NASA ke FIRMS project ke aankade kehete hai ki 2018 main 4 se 15 november ke bich uttar bharat main paraali jalaane kii 32000 ghatnaayen darj hui thim
 In 2019, only about 25000 incidents have been recorded in this period
 sabase jaruri baat ki pichley saal diwali 7 november ko thi
 Pollution increases in the days following Diwali in Delhi, despite that the AQI at that time was better than the odd-even days of this year
 DIU ne iske pehle report kiya tha ki od-ivan se dilli main yatayaat main jam kii samasya se bhale nijaat milti ho, lekin isaki vajah se hawa kii gunvattta main koi sudhaar nahin darj hua he
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Raghav Chadha said that aud-even helped control "even worse" air quality
 unhone india today se kaha, “od-ivan yojana ek apatkaaleen upaay tha or ise invyrement polution (privansion and control) athurity ke suzav par lagu kiya gaya tha
 The plan may not have reduced the air quality from 'very poor' to 'medium', but it helped prevent it from getting worse
 ”to pradooshan kaa kaaran kya he?cpcb kaa kahana he ki hawa kii gunvattta mausam sambandhi bahut saare gatisheel karkon par nirbhar karti he jo bhugolic sthanon ke hisaab se aksar badalte rahete hai
 Mainly wind speed, wind direction and temperature determine the air quality of a place
 od-ivan yojana ke lagu hone ko lekar 2016 main CPCB ne apni report saunpi thi
 It stated that "apart from emissions from various sources including vehicles, several meteorological factors such as mixing height (the height at which pollutants accumulate in the air), wind speed, temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, etc
 would have been decided by What will be the level of pollution
 jin aankadon kaa vishleshan kiya gaya, use prabhavit karne ke liye vaahanon se hone vaale utsarjan main kami kii paryaapt nahin he
 ”(with input from Deepu Rai) agar aapako lakhon rupee ke package vaali naukari mil jaae to kya aap chhodana chahenge? shaayad aapkaa jawaab naa hi hoga
 After all, who would not want to earn lakhs of rupees? aaj ek aisi ladki kii kahani bataane ja rahe hai jisane bacchon ko padhaane ke khatir lakhon rupee kii naukari ko chhod di or desh main shiksha vyavastha ko sudhaarney main kaary karne lageen
 First left home then sought alms, now became the first transgender judge of the country, IIM Bangalore, after getting a master's degree, Sameena Bano got a job in America in a good position
 kuch dinon tak naukari karne ke baad samina ko mahasoos hone laga ki jis mehnat or lagan ke saath vah duusare desh ke liye kaam kar rahi hai, kyon na apane desh ke liye karen or desh kii shiksha vyavastha ko sudhaarney main apana yogadan den
 This child, who is five years old, comes to this song after thinking of millions of views, Samina, daughter of Air Force officer, left India in 2012 and returned to India
 jab vah america se laut kar bharat ai to unke mata pita hairaan ho gaye the
 He got into this thinking, why did Samina come back to India after leaving such a good life? But Sameena was determined
 wo desh ke liye kuch karnaa chaahati thim
 Wanted to do something in the field of education
 iske liye unhone bengalooru or pune shahar ko chunaa
 But when friends advised, she came to Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan lakhanu main kiraye par ghar lekar unhone kaam kii shuruyaat kii
 In Uttar Pradesh, Sameena met Vinod Yadav, who had a good knowledge of education, health and agriculture
 samina ko vinod yadav se bahut madad mili
 This person shows the way of living to millions of blind
 
 
 samina ne vinod ke saath milakar 'bharat abhyuday foundation' kii sthapana kii or garib basti main rahane vaale 50 bacchon ko padhaanaa shuru kar diya
 The result of his efforts was that within 18 months, 20 thousand poor children from 50 districts of Uttar Pradesh got admission in 3 thousand private schools
 lekin yah itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Larger schools opposed this
 hai court or supreme court main 2 saal kii ladaai ke baad aakhirkaar samina kii jeet hui or jin siton par sirf 108 bacchon ko hi admician mila tha, saal 2015 tak un par samina ke prayaason ke kaaran 4400 garib bacchon ko admician mila
 By 2016, this figure had increased to 15,646

 unmukt ne kaha, 'ham gherlu str par cricket ke sabhi formet khelte hai
 In domestic competitions, Ranji Trophy is given more importance, so that you cannot remove Test cricket from inside a player
 ' unmukt ne england daure par gai team india kii test siries main kharaab pradarshan ke liye ipel ko jimmedaar tehraae jane ko bhi galat bataaya
 He said, 'the IPL gives young cricketers a chance to play with the world's top players and this experience is a must for all young cricketers
 khud mujhe royles kii ore se khelte hue bahut phayda hua
 On Team India's embarrassing performance in England, Unmukt said, "being a cricketer, i know that many times there are difficult times
" mujhe lagata he ki sabakuch khilaadi ke aatmavishvaas par nirbhar karata he

 Earlier, after the family quarrel broke out, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav arrived in Lucknow from Delhi on Thursday evening and started an attempt to settle the feud with his son and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and brother Shivpal Yadav
 tippaniyan As soon as Mulayam reached here he summoned Shivpal and held a meeting with him in a closed room to make the situation normal
 shivpal ne baad main akhilesh se unke aadhikarik nivas par mulaakaat kii
 Sources said the two met for about 20 minutes on Mulayam's instructions
 isse pehle mulaayam ke chachere bhai or sapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ne kaha tha, "unke (mulaayam) yahaan pahunchane ke baad sabakuch thik ho jayega
 His talk will be final
 " isse pehle din main ramgopal ne mukhyamantri se mulaakaat kii thi or daawa kiya tha, 'akhilesh kisi se bhi naaraaz nahin hai or netaji (mulaayam) kaa faisla party main antim he
 " jaise hi mulaayam yahaan pahunche unhone shivpal ko talab kiya or halaat ko saamaanya banane ke liye band kamare main unke saath baithak kii
 Shivpal later met Akhilesh at his official residence
 sutron ne bataaya ki mulaayam ke nirdesh par donon ke bich kareeb 20 minute tak baithak hui
 Earlier, Mulayam's cousin and SP national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav had said, "everything will be alright once he (mulayam) arrives here
" unki baat antim hogi
 "earlier in the day, Ram Gopal had met the Chief Minister and claimed, 'akhilesh is not angry with anyone and Netaji's (mulayam) decision is the last in the party

 Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has started this raga by himself
 pakhwaade bhar main hi dobaaraa ve ram mandir kaa nirmaan fouran shuru karne kii baat kar chuke hai
 At the address of the Sadhu Swadhyay Sangam Camp in Haridwar on 2 October, he declared, “ram temple will be built in every situation
 '' uske kuch din baad hi, 18 aktubar ko nagpur main aresas ke vaarshik vijayadashami bhaashan main unhone kaha, "mandir dhahaakar babar ne hamaare swabhimaan ko aahat kiya tha
 Therefore the construction of the Ram temple is mandatory to restore our self-respect
 ram janmabhumi par iskaa nirmaan jaldi se jaldi hona chahie
 We will have full support in this
 ''agle din 19 aktubar ko uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne ayodhya main vivaadaaspad sthal kaa daura kiya or elaan kiya ki ayodhya "meri nijee aasthaa'' kaa maamla bhi he
 Meanwhile, Pravin Togadia, the head of the International Hindu Council, is also trying to ignite the temple construction by initiating the Ayodhya Yatra
 haalanki kaha ja saktaa he ki isamen unhen bahut safalataa nahin mili he
 The economy has plunged and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's unbeatable image has suffered a setback, thus making it the last chance for the advocates of the Ram temple to pursue their agenda
 shaayad isi vajah se ab ye log chaahate hai ki is mudde ko adalati faisle se nahin, balki kanoon banaakar nibataya jaae
 Bhagwat said in Nagpur, "it has been proved that there was a temple under that ground
 kuch rajnatik tatv nyaayik prakriya main aadchan paidaa karke bematlab uljhaae rakhane kii koshish kar rahe hai, taaki maamla lagaataar talataa rahe

 ab sarkaar iske liye kanoon banaae
 "not only this, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) 16-member Sant High Powered Committee for the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya put up a demand for bringing the ordinance to its meeting on 5 October (VHP)
 vihip ke prastaav kaa nishkarsh he, "pradhanmantri narendra modi (dilli main) or mukhyamantri yogi adityanath (lakhanu main) ke rahete agar mandir nahin bana to yah kabhi nahin ban paaegaa
 However, senior advocate Zafaryab Jilani, convener of the Babri Masjid Action Committee, says that it is not possible to bring an ordinance
 unke mutabik, "maamla adaalat main he
 Until the Supreme Court gives its verdict, no government can bring any law in this matter
 isliye is maukey par aisi kisi pahal ko adaalat main chunauti di jaaegi
 Shashi Tharoor, the Congress MP and author of the book Why i am a Hindu, sparked a new spark in a literature event on October 15 by saying that "no good Hindu would want to break someone else's place of worship and build a temple
" ''lekin sangh parivaar ke log apni tech par ade dikhte hai
 In fact, the VHP resolution has a resolution that if the government does nothing, they will take up this matter
 prastaav kahata he, "agar sarkaar koi samaysima nahin tay karti he to andolan or vidroh kaa hi vikalp bachataa he
 Saints of various Hindu monasteries and akharas have said that they will soon start an agitation for temple construction, meet governors of all states next month and a week after December 18 for Ram temple at every monastery and Hindu places of worship

 First of all, however, the new Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi will have to reconstitute the three-judge bench hearing the case
 usamen purv pradhan nyaayadhish deepak mishra kii jagah kisi or nyaayadhish ko laana hoga
 Justice Gogoi can also replace the other two judges of the bench if he wishes

 Earlier, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Mishra has rejected the request of Sunni Waqf Board counsel Kapil Sibal, Rajeev Dhawan et al, that the hearing in the case be deferred till July 2019
 sibbal kii daleel thi, "is faisle ke rajnatik nattejey vyapak hone vaale hai
 The speed of hearing has suddenly come from the appeal of a person (BJP Rajya Sabha member Subrahmanyam Swamy) who is not even a party to it

 Abdul Nazir's bench held a 2–1 majority with Drs
 em
 The Supreme Court verdict of October 24, 1994 in Ismail Farooqui v
 Center, refused to refer the petition to a larger bench
 vah faisla isse sambandhit he ki kya bhartiya rajya ko kisi dharmasthal yani mandir, masjid yaa girjaghar kaa adhigrahan karne kaa adhikaar he
 In 1994, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled that the government's move to acquire the land where the mosque was held was legitimate because the mosque is not an essential part of the adherence to its religion for followers of Islam
 adaalat ne kaha ki prarthana karnaa dharm ke anupaalan ke liye bilashak behad anivaary he lekin har vah jagah jahaan prarthana kii jaae, dharm kaa anivaary ang nahin hoti, basharte us dharm ke liye uskaa "khaas mahatv'' na ho
 In this way, the judges ruled that the mosque "is not an indispensable part of the observance of Islam" and that Muslims can offer namaz anywhere, even in the open
 ''is daleel ke saath 27 sitambar ko tatkaaleen pradhan nyaayadhish mishra kii aguai vaali teen jajon kii peeth ne 1994 ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa or us par punarvichaar karne ke liye kisi badi peeth ke hawaale karne se inkaar kar diya
 The bench said in its majority decision that the 1994 verdict was related to the acquisition of controversial land in Ayodhya and not to any religious matter
 yahi nahin, supreme court ke is faisle ke mutabik, iskaa ayodhya kii vivaadit jameen kii milkiyat ke vivaad se koi lenaa-dena nahin he or isliye ise badi peeth ke hawaale karne kii jarurat nahin he
 However, a party that appealed to reconsider the 1994 judgment of the Supreme Court as mistaken, M
 siddiki kii pairvi kar rahe varisht vakil rajeev dhawan kii daleel thi, "bahumat kaa faisla bahusankhyak ko khush karegaa or alpamat kaa faisla alpsankhyak ko
 This will not solve any problem on which we started thinking
 '' is tarah unhone 1994 ke faisle par punarvichaar karne kii daleel pesh kii or kaha ki is puure maamle ko nishchay hi badi peeth ke hawaale kiya janaa chahie

 On this new decision of the Supreme Court, VHP working president Alok Kumar said, "I am satisfied that this appeal was dismissed
" isse ab ram janmabhumi se sambandhit yachikaaon kii sunwaayee kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 Subramanian Swamy has already said that he will take a fresh petition to the Supreme Court to expedite the hearing of the case

 The statements of Congress leaders are against the dignity of Parliament
 
 
 " Smriti said that the members of the youth wing of the Congress party protested against the Speaker's decision to suspend 25 members of the Congress, so does Rahul Gandhi want the Congress to learn these values
 unhone kaha, "loksabhaa main sushamaa ji ne chunauti di thi ki ek bhi kagaz laakar dikhaaen
 
 
 Congress party should accept that challenge
 
 
 darasal, inke paas kuch bhi nahin he
 
 
 It is easy to give one and a half minute bytes on camera, but it is difficult to keep your talk in the house for one and a half hours
 
 
 " Smriti Irani, while speaking to reporters in the Parliament House complex, said, "when someone makes a statement in the Parliament of the country, it gives the people of the country in confidence and with confidence

 "the Union Minister said that Parliament is a platform where social, economic and cultural subjects of the country and issues related to them are discussed and a solution is found
 yahaan kahi gai baton ko 'theetrics' kahana, isaki garima ko kam karnaa he
 The BJP leader also claimed that the Narendra Modi-led government has taken many historic steps for the betterment of the people of the country and for the development of the country in more than a year, and has also made a Naga peace agreement for peace restoration
 
 smriti ne kaha, "desh ke vikaas kaa maarg baadhit karne ke liye desh kii janata congress party ko kabhi maaf nahin karegi

 Apart from Sushma Swaraj, Congress leaders have also accused Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan of bias
 kendriya maanav sansaadhan evam vikaas mantri smriti irani ne is masale par baat karte hue gandhi parivaar par chutki lee or kaha ki donon mahilaayein (sumitra or sushamaa) saamaanya pariwaron se ai hai

 The Congress leader's statement is an insult to the mandate of the people of the country
 
 
 "tippaniyan Asked about the Congress president accusing Sushma Swaraj of being a 'master of drama', Smriti Irani said, "calling what is said in Parliament is against its dignity

 To call the things said here 'theatrics' is to reduce its dignity

 Smriti said, "the people of the country will never forgive the Congress Party for obstructing the path of development of the country
" 
 
 " Speaking on the issue, Union Human Resource and Development Minister Smriti Irani quipped on the Gandhi family and said that both women (sumitra and Sushma) came from ordinary families

 '- Input IANS kya koi mard bina kisi doctorl madad ke garbhadhaaran kar saktaa he
 Can a man have a baby in his stomach
 jawaab yakeenan naa main hoga lekin firozabad kaa ek aisa baba he jo ye daawa kar rahaa he ki uske pet main 6 maheene kaa baccha he
 We are going to rule the puzzle of Baba's stomach today, but before that it is important for you to know what this Baba Dawa is doing
 pawan baba naam se janaa jane vaale ye shaks apane aap ko june akhaada kaa sadhu bataata he or daawa kar rahaa he ki iske pet main baccha he
 Pawan Baba, resident of Daulatpur town of Firozabad, has been making this sensational claim ever since
 unhen dekhne waalon kii bheed lag gai he
 Everyone's eyes are fixed on Baba's stomach and Baba is not shying away from narrating his strange story of conceiving in great detail
 inaki kahani kuch maheene pehle se shuru hoti he or ek sant-mahatma par jaakar tik jaati he
 Pawan Baba has become a subject of surprise and surprise in Firozabad and the surrounding area
 har kisi kii jubaan par bas ek hi sawaal he ki aakhir koi mard kaise ban saktaa he baap
 How can a man reverse the law of nature? haalanki aise logon kii kami nahin he jo baba kii kahani ko sabase bada paakhand maan rahe hai
 Baba says that they will have a child and that too Avatar
 aashcharya baba kii kathani par ho rahaa he or hairaani is baat ko lekar bhi ho rahi he ki media ke hi kuch halkon main baba ke is daawey ko jor-shor se uthaaya gaya
 It was tried to say that whatever Baba is saying is not right but wrong
 lekin ek jimmedaar channel hone ke naate ajtak ne is baba ke pet kii hakeekat kii padtaal karne kaa bidaa uthaaya
 Even today, Aaj Tak has opened the pole of many babas who fool the people of India by calling for religion and God
 lihaaja hamane ye jaanane kii koshish ki aakhir pawan baba jo bhi daawa kar rahaa he usame kitni sachai he
 First of all we reached the doctor of the area
 doctor ne saaf-saaf kaha ki kisi mard ko bina vigyaan kii madad se baccha nahin ho saktaa he
 Our investigation did not end here
 hamane baba ke ek-ek kathan or ek-ek gatividhi par paini najar rakhni shuru kar di kyonki hamane thaan liya tha ki pawan baba jo daawey kar rahe hai aakhir usame kitna dam he
 Is there really a baby in his stomach or is there a fit in Baba's mind
 apni jaanch ko mukammal anjaam tak pahunchane ke liye ajtak pawan baba ko firozabad se dilli lekar aayaa
 There was only one question in front of us, how can the rule of creation and nature be violated
 abhi tak pawan baba kii doctorl jaanch nahin hui thi lihaaja ham unhen sidhe le gaye dilli ke ek bade aspataal main ultrasound ke liye
 The doctors started doing Baba's ultrasound in front of us
 kuch minute tak baba kaa ultrasound chalane ke baad jaanch kii ye prakriya khatm ho gai
 The ultrasound report of Baba's stomach has come before us
 sachai hamaare saamne aa chuki thi or baba ke pet or uske daawey kii hakeekat kaa raaj fash ho chukaa tha
 The ultrasound report has made it clear that there is no child in the stomach of Pawan Baba, a hermit from Juna Arena
 pawan baba ne koi garbh dhaaran nahin kiya he or baba kii sari baaten sirf managasaint hai
 Baba has no fat in his stomach
 fat kii maatra zyada he isliye pet phool gaya he
 Due to bloated stomach, the seed born in Baba's mind that he is pregnant
 isi ke saath ajtak ne pawan baba ke saare daavon kii hawa nikaal di he
 Aaj Tak exposed Pawan Baba
 ye baat saaf ho chuki he ki pawan baba pichley 6 maheene se garbh dhaaran karne kii jis baat ko baar-baar kah rahe the usame koi sachai nahin

 jabaki, donon partiyaan ek saath chunavi ran main kismat aajamaa rahi hai
 Despite this, there is a constant check-up between the BJP and Shiv Sena
 bijepi ne apni ranneeti se shivasena ko junior partner kii haisiyat ke saath-saath baaki chote sahyogi dalon kii seat ko bhi apane khate main kar liya he
 The bjp-led NDA coalition in Maharashtra consists of a total of five parties to say
 isamen bijepi, shivasena, arpiai (e), arsapi or raiyat kranti party shaamil hai
 But if you see the list of NDA candidates in the assembly elections, only BJP and Shiv Sena are seen fighting
 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke liye uddhav thakare shuru se 50-50 siton shering formule ko bijepi ke saamne rakh rahe the
 After several rounds of meetings, the NDA decided that out of the total 288 assembly seats in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena would contest 124 seats and BJP 150 seats
 baaki bachi 14 siton ko sahyogi dalon ke liye chodi gai thi
 The BJP has cleverly subdued not only the Shiv Sena but also other smaller allies
 ye tha bijepi kaa daanv124 siton ke saath khush shivasena ko tab jhatka laga, jab use pataa chalaa ki bijepi ne baaki sahyogi dalon kii 14 siton par bhi apane pratyaashee ko utaarne ko formule ko amalijama pahana diya he
 In Maharashtra, the BJP has contested in 164 such seats but not 164 seats
 arpiai (athavle), arsapi, shiv sangramaur raiyat kranti party kii cote main ai siton par utre pratyaashee bijepi ke chunaav nishaan camel par kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 With this strategy of BJP, not only Shiv Sena but also workers of allied parties are seen in a tussle
 maharashtra main endie gathbandhan se arpiai ko 6 mili hai
 Dr Vivek Gujar from Malshiras seat, Digambar Agawane from Phaltan seat, Mohan Phad from Pathri seat, Rajesh Pawar from Naigav, Arvind Bhaladhare from Bhandara
 in pratyaashiyon ke naam kaa elaan bhi 3 oktoberarpiai (e) pramukh ramdaas athavlene kiya, lekin inamen se koi netaa arpiai kaa sadsy nahin rahaa
 When Vivek Gujar's form was canceled from Malshiras seat, ABVP leader Ram Satput was declared an authorized candidate
 bhale hi athavle ne in sabhi pratyaashee ke naamon kaa elaan kiya ho, lekin ye sabhi bijepi ke tikat or chunaav nishaan par maidan main hai
 Resentment among allies: In the current assembly elections in Maharashtra, BJP has given ticket to Rahul Kul, sitting MLA of Rashtriya Samaj Paksha from Daund assembly
 aadhikarik rup se bijepi kaa kahana he ki rahul ko arsapi ke saath hue seat bantwaare ke tahat tikat mila he
 RSP chief Mahadev Jankar is angry about this and objecting to the bjp's attitude, calling it a hoax
 mahadev jankaar daawa kiya ki unka koi bhi kaaryakarta bijepi ke tikat par chunaav nahin ladega
 Due to this, the RSP has fielded two of its candidates on their election trail in the electoral fray
 lekin aisi raajnneetik himmat arpiai (e) ke ramdaas athavle nahin juta sake

 kisi kaatil ke katl karne kii baat to samaj main aati he, lekin katl ke baad ghar main taala lagaakar jane kii baat samaj main nahin aati
 One such puzzle of the triple murder that surfaced in Delhi is similar
 kaatil ghar main daakhil hota he
 a woman and her two innocent children are killed and go out and lock the door of the house
 pashchimi dilli ke uttam nagar ilaake main somvaar shaam ko huitripal murderki kahani ne police ko uljhaakar rakh diya he
 The murderer enters the house
 vahaan rahane vaali 34 saal kii mahila or uske do maasoom bacchon kii jaan letaa he, lekin jate-jate flats main baahar taala laga jaataa he
 The lock, that too of his house
 custom and exise inspector amit kumaar is roj jab kaam se laute to ek dahalaanevaali khabar unka intjaar kar rahi thi
 He was surprised for the first time when he saw his house locked from outside
 unhen laga ki shaayad unki bivi or bachche unhen bina bataae kahin baahar gaye hai
 So, he briefly moved to a neighbor's house
 lekin jab thodi der baad laute to haalat jas kii tas thi
 The lights of the house were burning, Amit first calls on his wife's mobile
 lekin ek ke baad ek kai baar phone karne ke baavjood jab unhen koi rispance nahin miltaa to wo baichaiyn ho uthte hai
 One reason for Amit's uneasiness is that all the lights are burning inside the house and there is also the sound of wings running
 lekin baar-baar ghanti bajaane or phone karne ke baavjood andar se koi kuch nahin bol rahaa
 Now Amit tells this to the neighbors and then the neighbors jump from the flat and enter inside their flat
 duusari ore, padosi ghar kaa taala todane kii koshish karte hai
 But upon seeing the inside, Amit's senses fly away
 wo vahiin farsh par baithkar rone lagate hai
 There are three triplets in the house
 amit kii 34 saal kii bivi deepa kii, 9 saal ke bete sakasham or 6 saal kii beti vaishnavi kii
 Till then, the people of the neighborhood have also entered Amit's house, but seeing the inside, everyone's hush stands up
 bedroom main thi patni kii lashdeepa kii laash bedroom ke farsh par padi thi or uske gale main chunni lipati thi
 The body of his two children was in the bathroom
 lekin bathroom ke aas-paas bikharaa khun or jism par bane jakhm gavaahi dete hai ki donon bacchon kaa katl galaa ret kar kiya gaya he
 Now the police is informed of the incident immediately
 chunki maamla tripal murder kaa he
 Along with the police of the local police station, many big officers arrive at the opportunity
 subut jutaney or suraag talashne kii koshish tej ho jaati he
 But the question is, after all, who killed these three? Why did you do it? Was it the result of someone's rivalry with Amit or Deepa? To try robbery? Or was there another reason? But the biggest question was, why did the murderer lock the house on the go? Read further 5 important clues from the opportunity-a-case
 
 
 suraag number ekkatil beshak ghar main baahar se taala laga kar gaya, lekinkatlase pehle use ghar main daakhil hone ke liye koi mashkkat nahin kerani padi
 This means that the way the murderer entered this flat on the second floor comfortably indicates that the murderer was going to know Deepa, the wife of Amit Kumar, because neither one heard any noise of coercion there and Neither did any such marks be found on the door afterwards
 suraag number dojis tarah jate-jate kaatil ne ghar main baahar se taala laga diya, wo bhi is baat kii taraf ishaara karata he ki kaatil shaayad deepa yaa phir amit kaa jaankaar tha, jo is vaardaat ko zyada der tak logon kii nigahon se chhipaae rakhana chahta tha
 Not only this, he also knew about the locks kept in the house because the killer who was locked outside the house did not bring the murderer with him, but it was the lock kept in his house
 suraag number tinmauka-e-vaardaat ke muyne se ye baat bhi saaf ho gai ki ghar main koi lutpaat nahin hui kyonki ghar kaa koi bhi saamaan bikharaa hua nahin tha
 In this case, whoever the murderer was, he wanted to kill Deepa
 yani katl kaa makasad lutpaat nahin, balki dushmani thi
 Clue number four sources say that both Amit and Deepa's children were seen playing outside till six in the evening
 is dauraan unki beti vaishnavi ko girane se chot lag gai thi or tab unke donon bacchon ko kisi padosi ne ghar chale jane kii salaah di thi
 After this, the children went upstairs to their flat
 lekin shaam kareeb saat baje jab pehali baar amit apane ghar laute to unhone apane ghar main taala laga hua dekha
 That is, the murderer carried out the crime between six and half past seven in the evening
 suraag number panchapulice kii maane to kaatil kii dushmani amit yaa phir deepa donon main se kisi se bhi ho sakati he
 It is possible that there may be enmity with both, but the murderer was probably the target of Deepa as the murderer reached his house around six and a half in the evening, while Amit reaches home only after about seven o'clock every day
 kaatil ke taale main uljhi is murder mistry ko sulajhane main lagi dilli police is vakt kuch inhen baton ko jehan main rakhkar tafteesh aage badha rahi he
 She wants to know what is the reason behind this murder
 And what is the enmity with Deepa or Amit of the murderer? With this thought, the police is now tracing each movement of Custom Inspector Amit Kumar and his wife Deepa, which have been doing both during the last one week
 bas isi garaj se police donon ke gharavaalon, padosiyon or amit se poochtacha ke saath-saath unke telephone kii kol ditels bhi khangaal rahi he
 Police believe that the reason for the murder may also be a complication of relationships
