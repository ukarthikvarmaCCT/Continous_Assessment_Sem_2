 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki bhartiya team ke anbhavi tej gendbaaj eshanth sharma or umesh yadav par jasprit bumraah ko tarjeeh die jane se bhi unhen hairaani hui
 Du Plessis said, 'we were surprised
 hamen nahin laga tha ki jasprit bumraah khelegaa
 He was doing well in ODI cricket, but we were preparing for other fast bowlers as he has played more Tests
 'dakshin africa ne pehle test main bhale hi 72 ranon ke antar se jeet darj kii ho, lekin captain phalf du plasis ne kaha ki bharat ke khilaaf pehle test main 208 ran kaa lakshya dene ke baad vah nervas ho gaye the

 If Dale Steyn had been there, the Indian team would have been out cheaply ' Just before the Delhi elections, former Delhi CM Sheila Dixit has indicated that she can support the Aam Aadmi Party after the election
 shila dikshit ne kaha ki hamaari spashtataa ye hai ki ham kisi sampradayik party ko samarthan nahin de sakate
 According to Sheila Dixit, two things are clear that one contest is triangular and the other is that the Congress cannot support BJP, the rest will tell what will happen next
 shila dikshit ne kaha ki ''pichhali dfa hamane aam aadmi party ko samarthan diya tha baahar se, bijepi ko nahin diya tha kyonki bijepi ek sampradayik party he or ham sampradayik party ke saath santh-ganth nahin kar sakate
 Despite that government did not work, now what is the situation will be difficult to say
 par muqabla trikoniya he, jaisaa pichhali baar tha vaisaa is baar bhi he
 '' haalanki dilli congress ke adhyaksh arvinder singh lavali ne sab atakalon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki congress aap yaa kisi party ko saport nahin karegi, congress maanati hai ki sangh pratyaksh rup se bijepi or paroksh rup se aap ko chalaata he
 If it was easy to dismiss Sheila Dixit's statement and hint, why would the news become big? Aam Aadmi Party supremo and former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that - shila ji kaa bayaan ahm he
 - Congress has conceded defeat
 - logon ko apana vot congress ko dekar vyarth nahin karnaa chahie
 - Now Delhi elections are a battle of only two parties bijepi ko mauka mil gaya ye bataane kaa ki congress or aap mili hue hai
 BJP leader Vijay Goel said, it is clear that both the Congress and AAP have conceded defeat and both of them are on the same plate
 bhale hi shila dikshit ladaai trikoniya bataa rahi hon, lekin jamini asaliyat yahi dikhti he ki muqaabala aap or bijepi ke bich he
 If the Congress is weakened further, the Aam Aadmi Party will be strong, but if the Congress regains its land, the BJP will benefit

 agar aisa hota he to har din dilli kii sirf aadhi gaadiyaan yani ke 40 lakh gaadiyaan hi dilli kii sadakon par nikal sakati hai

 According to religious beliefs, this is the place where Lord Krishna was pierced by the arrow of a fowler and in front of him is installed, folded the hands of the fowler, apologizing to the statue, who was repenting by shooting arrows at Krishna
 lekin krishna to antaryami the
 They knew very well that they may run the world at their own behest, but now the time has come for them to walk from this world

 Lord Krishna, injured by an arrow, reached the banks of the Deer River, located a little away from Bhalka
 hiran nadi somnath se mahaj dedh kilometre kii duuri par he
 It is said that at the same place the Lord merged into the five elements
 vahiin se bhagwaan sidhe baikunth dham chale gaye
 But even today, along the banks of the Deer River, there are traces of the feet of God and which is famous worldwide as Dehotsarg Tirtha
 lekin us jagah kii bhi kam ahmiyat nahin he, jahaan se baheliye ne bhagwaan par hiran samajhakar nishaanaa saadhaa tha

 daal ke daam thaamne kii sarkari koshishen lagaataar beasar sabit ho rahi hai

 khaadya mantri ram vilaas paswan ne enditivi se kaha, "ham myanmar or mozambik sarkaron se baat karenge ki is bare main kya-kya sambhav he
 Two teams of senior officials will visit these two countries this week
 isamen duusare mantralay ke adhikari bhi shaamil honge
 " darasal daal ke daamon par qaabu paane kii sari sarkari koshishen kargar nahin raheen
 The government imported a large quantity of pulses - in the last three months more than 14000 tonnes of pigeonpea and urad dal were sourced from outside, but they are kept in government shops or godowns, they have not reached the big mandis of the country
 dilli anaaj vyapaaree sangh ke upaadhyaksh anand garg ne enditivi se kaha ki sarkaar ne daal vyapaariyon par jis tarah sakhti barti or stock holding limit ko lekar karrwai kii
 
 
 After that, traders are no longer importing that much
 duusari taraf sarkaar jo hazaron ton daal aayaat kar rahi he wo bazaar tak nahin pahunchaa rahi he
 The result is that the prices of lentils are not decreasing
 dilli main urad daal 161 rupee kilo rupee bik rahi he
 While in Mangalore it has reached close to Rs 200 - selling for Rs 196; In Bangalore, the price is just one rupee less - Rs 195 and in Bathinda Rs 185 a kg
 sankat ye he ki centre ne baahar se jo daal mangai he, use zyaadaatar rajya kareedne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 While it is being given to them at the rate of only 66 rupees per kg
 krishi rajya mantri sanjeev balayan ne enditivi se kaha, "daal kii keemton ko niyantrit karne ke liye kendra or rajya sarkaron ko milakar kaam karnaa hoga
 State governments have all the rights for distribution
 agar wo gambhirtha se pahal nahin karenge to keemten niyantrit karnaa sambhav nahin hoga
 " mushkil ye bhi he ki kai rajya sarkaron ke paas hazaron ton kaccha dal saste daron par kendra se kharid kar unka prasanskaran karaane kii kshamta nahin he
 This is also the reason why more than half of the state governments have not bought pulses from the center at cheap rates

 chhattisgarh ke rajanandgaanv main bharat tibet seemaa police (ITBP) ne naksaliyon ke khilaaf oparation shuru kar diya he
 Naxalites are sleepless due to this operation
 aamtaur par naksali is tarah oparation shuru hone ke baad padosi rajyon main bhaag jate the
 But this time the ITBP is pushing there too with the help of local police
 chhattisgarh se bhagkar naksali aksar madhyapradesh ke balaghat or maharashtra ke gondia or gatchiroli ilaake main panaah lete the
 But now it will not be possible
 darasalhaithbhfne donon hi rajyon ke sarahadi ilaakon main chaukasee badha di he
 There is also a coordination with the police of both the states
 is baat se naksali khaase pareshaan hai
 This ITBP campaign is progressing well
 rajanandgaanv ke aundhi thana kshetra ke mardgotaen gaanv main naksaliyon or ITBP ke javaanon ke bich muthbhed hui
 There was rapid firing on both sides, but somehow the Naxalites escaped by collapsing
 ghatana main kuch naksaliyon ko goli lagane kii jaankaree bhi mili he
 Daily use material and other items including claymore mines have been recovered from the encounter site
 ITBP or police milakar naksaliyon ke khilaaf yah abhiyaan rajanandgaanv kencsalprabhavit ilaakon main chalaa rahi he
 Top officials of ITBP are supervising this operation themselves
 gauratlab he ki puure rajya main is saal sainkadon naksaliyon ne aatmasamarpan kiya to kai naksali muthbhed ke dauraan maare gaye hai
 While hundreds of Naxalites have been arrested
 kisi bhi chunaav se pehle aksar musalamaanon ke voton ko lekar kaaphi charchaa hoti he
 After that the number of their representatives is counted, which keeps on increasing and increasing as the roots of democracy in the country become stronger
 is baar dilli vidhansabha chunaav main maatr chaar muslim vidhayak chune gaye hai, jo pichhali baar ke mukaable ek kam he
 The number of mlas in the community with a population of 12 per cent in Delhi is bound to be questioned
 kaha jaataa he ki loktantr main jisaki jitani sankhya baari, uski utani bhagidaari
 Why did this happen again? First, AAP had fielded five Muslims, four of whom won
 doosraa, musalamaanon ko ehsaas ho gaya tha ki bijepi ko sirf aap hi haraa sakati he
 Thirdly, the community has always preferred 'secular' parties and justice-like leaders; it has never been a priority for a leader to be Muslim or homogeneous
 chauthaa, musalamaanon ne kabhi bhi ekatarfa vot nahin diya, haalanki duusare samudaayon kii tarah isamen bhi siyaasi vajood bachaae rakhane kii chahat he
 This desire forces most of the community to support one party before voting
 iske alaava, bijepi yaa sangh samarthit partiyon ko chhodkar musalamaanon ne vibhinn partiyon ko usee tarah vot diya he, jaise bahusankhyak samudaay ke logon ne samarthan kiya he
 This time the majority of the Congress was sidelined, so did the Muslims
 yahi haal bispi kaa tha
 The majoritarian BJP has adopted such a policy that it has to die only by 'returning home' and by putting 'idols in mosques', so there is no unrequited love for the Muslim community
 aise main is samudaay ke paas dilli main aap se behatar vikalp na tha
 He knew that only Arvind Kejriwal could stop the bjp's Vijay Rath
 kejariwal dharm-jati kii raajnneeti nahin karte
 His jihad is against corruption
 ve garibon or vanchiton kii baat karte hai
 Want to increase the number of school-colleges and hospitals in Delhi
 sabase zyada swarozgaar karne vaale samudaay ke zyaadaatar logon ko aap kaa vikalp congress se behatar laga
 This would certainly bring relief to those Congressmen who were saying that the party's image had become minority, though during their tenure at the Center, the status of Muslims became that of India's 'new Dalit'
 or haa, musalamaanon kaa samarthan kam hone se party dilli vidhansabha se gaayab ho gai
 The number of Muslims in 10 assembly constituencies in Delhi is more than 20 percent
 inamen se paanch main ve 30 fisadi se zyada hai
 With this, they can neither form a government or topple it
 phir, vidhayak kisi bhi samudaay kaa ho vah partline se hatakar baat nahin kar saktaa
 The number of Muslim legislators does not matter much if the partyline is in line with the needs of this community
 aise main yah samudaay tactical voting ke jariye apane siyaasi vajood ko bachaae rakhti he
 The Muslims then realized their political existence by playing the role of force multiplier

 Taking a dig at the Center, he alleged that the UPA government was misusing the constitutional post like governor to 'destroy' the public life of the state
 modi ne yah bhi kaha ki gujarat ‘dilli sultanate’ ke aage nahin jhukegaa
 The Chief Minister said, 'this Delhi Sultanate should listen carefully, Gujarat will never do' Mujra 'in front of Delhi' Darbar '

 Modi said, 'the problem is that the people of Gujarat have not given anything to the Congress for the last several years and that is why they (congress leaders) are targeting me
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘gujarat ke logon se meraa kahana he ki ve congress ko kuch nahin dena jari rakhen

 ’modi ne aarope lagaaya ki centre gujarat ke saarvajanik jivan ko nasht karne ke liye rajyapal jaise sanvaidhanik pad kaa durupyog kar rahaa he
 Significantly, on Wednesday, Justice VM Sahai gave a major blow to the Lokayukta by rejecting the state's plea on the issue of appointment of the Lokayukta by giving a 2-1 verdict
 nyaayamurti sahay ne modi kii tikhi aalochana kii thi or kaha ki lokayukta mudde par mukhyamantri kaa kadam hamaare ‘loktantr ke vinaash’ ko darshata he
 The judge termed Modi's appointment of Justice (retd) RA Mehta as a blatant and daunting challenge by Modi, saying the move reflects a sense of wrongful invincibility achieved by him

 Rating: 4 Stardirector: Sam Mendes Artist: Daniel Craig, Monica Belucci, Leya Sidoo, Christoph Waltz and Dave Batista once again teamed up with Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig
 isse pehle 'skyphal' main donon ne saath aakar dhamal machaaya tha, is baar yah jodigems bondkadi kii 24veen film lekar ai he
 Sam Mendes has shown that he has much more to do with Bond
 tabhi to hameshaa kaaron ke saath dushmano ke chakke chhudaane vaale james bond puri film main helicopter or plane ke saath dushmano kii naak main dam karata he
 From the first scene of the film to the last scene, Agent 007's aerial feat is awesome
 ection haroonges hai, ourdeniel craigka hard luk unke kirdaar ko jaandaar banaata he
 He has also shown a lot of jauhar on his favorite car Ashton Martin
 yahi nahin, is baar vah plane kaa bhi istemaal karte hai or apane andaaj main plane ko barf par bhi utaar dete hai
 Danielle's fitness and acting as Bond is fun and this gives a good idea of his homework
 kahanegems bondke ek mishan kii he
 In which, as usual, he meets beautiful and dangerous coincidences
 haalanki is baar bond or bond girl donon pehle se alag hai or film main bond ladi kaa concept bhi piroyaa gaya he
 The film begins with Mexico's 'day of the Dead' festival and is a very interesting scene
 aag main ghi daalane yaa film ko lekar koricity jagaane kaa kaam kiya hamonica beluchine
 His sex appeal is amazing, his presence on the screen works to increase the thrill of the audience
 haalanki unka mafia kii vidhwaa kaa role sirf teen minute kaa he
 It eats a little, expected a little more
 blue ij da varmest color ke saath lokapriyata paane vaali leyaa sidu apane role main acchhee lagati hai or vah bond ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar chalati hai or bond girl kii rati-ratai bhoomika ko todatii hai
 If the film's vow factor is Monica, WWE wrestler Batista in the character of the heartless villain has shown that he can do amazing things without even speaking in the film
 unke chehre par aane vaale beraham bhav or ankhon se khelnaa vaaki mjedaar lagata he
 Can say that now he has become an actor with a good expression, not just a wrestler
 bond ke saath unki takkar jabardast he
 The film's main villains are Inglorious Bastard and Oscar-winning Christoph Waltz for 'jango Unchained'
 yah pehla mauka he jab bond film main aisa villen he jo bond ke saath hi palaa-badha he
 His style of torturing Bond is amazing
 christoff ne dikhaa diya he ki vah villen ke taur par bhi apni acting se dil jeet sakate hai
 In the film, Bond is on a mission, due to the same mission he shows his Jauhar in London, Austria and Rome
 haalanki kahani kai morchon par chalati he or ant main thodi-si khinchi hui lagati he lekin bond ke ection is baat ko thodaa halkaa kar dete hai
 Sam Mendes' direction is amazing
 dilachasp yah ki is hafte james bond salmaan khan kii 'prem ratan dhan payo' ko takkar degaa kyonki bollywood is hafte koi badi film relies nahin kar rahaa he
 Everyone wanted to clear the way for Bhai's film
 vaise bhi is saal hollywood kii filmon (furious-7, jurassic world, avengers or mishan imposible) kaa record shandaar rahaa he

 aarope he ki police ne ek bekasoor vyakti ko farji cese main fansaaya, blackmel kar paise maange or paise na milane par hiraasat main third degree torchar diya
 Not only this, the police also tried to mislead the court by presenting fake medical report
 iske alaava police ne peedit ko uske ghar se hiraasat main liya, jabaki FIR main rithala metro stesan se giraftaar dikhaai
 The victim's wife has demanded justice by giving written complaints to other departments including Delhi Police officials

 On the morning of new April 6 around 10

 When asked by the police, he did not tell the family anything
 giraftaar kii jagah bhi galat dikhainvin kii patni ne bataaya ki police waalon ne exiaar main giraftaar kii jagah bhi galat dikhaai he
 It is seen in CCTV that the police took Naveen with him from the car in front of his house, while the police arrested Naveen in the FIR on April 6 at 7 pm
 15 baje rithala metro stesan se dikhaai he
 The 5 lakh rupees sought to leave were kept in the metro Vihar police post of Shahabad Dairy and no one was allowed to meet
 is bich do se teen police vaale naveen ke ghar pahunche or phone par kisi se baat karwaai
 The person talking on the phone demanded five lakh rupees from Naveen's family
 naveen kii patni ne jab paise dene main asamarthta jataai to rakam ghataakar 3 lakh rupee kar di gai
 Naveen's wife, however, flatly refused to pay the police
 is bich naveen ko thane main band rakhaa gaya
 At night, when the family was in the outpost, some policemen came and drove everyone out
 kuch hi der baad naveen kicheekhney-chillane kii awajenane lageen
 Naveen's elder brother and maternal uncle tried to complain to the police control room six to seven times
 thodi der main ek pisiar samet police adhikari bhi maukey par pahunche, lekin kisi ne kuch nahin kiya
 The policemen took him to Maharishi Valmiki Hospital after badly beating fake medical report
 police ne aspataal se jo medical report banavaai usamen naveen ke jakhmon ko do din purana dikhaaya gaya
 The same night, a case was registered against Naveen for being caught with a pistol
 adaalat ne khud liya sangyangale din jab police ne naveen ko rohinee court main pesh kiya to naveen jaj ke saamne gir padaa
 The judge directed Naveen to get medical again in Sanjay Gandhi Hospital
 jab sanjay gandhi aspataal se medical report ai to police kimedical report jhoothisabit ho gai
 The family members of the victim also reported the entire police action to the judge
 gharavaalon ne bataaya ki chaowkee incharge punit greval, IO praveen tomars or head consteble krishna ne dhamkee bhi di he ki abhi to arms act main fansaaya he, agar unke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai kii to anjaam acha nahin hoga

 But perhaps the makers forgot that a good story is also needed to win the audience's heart
 aaie sani-arbaj ke romance se bhari is film kii samiksha karte hai
 
 
 Kahani This story is about Raunak (sunny Leone), who runs an art gallery, who one day meets painter Veer (arbaaz Khan)
 mulaakaat ke saath hi donon ke bich main pyaar panpane lagata he
 Raunak is greatly influenced by the art of making Veer's painting and gives his painting a place in his art gallery
 ek din jab raunak ke chaar clients khaas tarah kii painting kii talash main unke paas aate hai
 The four clients are quite happy seeing Veer's painting there and fall behind his painting
 kyonki unhen ek videshi khariddaar ko ek million main painting bechni hoti he
 Twists and turns come into the story a lot
 ab kya yah chaaron client vir se jabardastee karke painting le ja pate hai
 What happens to Veer and Raunak's love story? Finally, to know which big twist comes, you will have to watch the film
 Review: bhatki kahani, raay lakshmi kii juli 2 main aakhir kya dikhaanaa chaahate the nirdeshkakamjor kadiyanfilm kii kahani bahut hi ghisi-pity he
 From the very first frame, there is a feeling of boredom
 script bahut hi kamjor he isi ke saath actors ke dabing kaa sinc bhi bahut bemail he
 If you are thinking that along with having adult content, you will get more bold scenes in the presence of Sunny Leone
 to yakeen maniye is lihaaj se bhi aap niraash honge
 The film shows an exchange of forced dialogues
 film ko dekhte hue aisa lagata he bahut sara paisa ekasaath barbaad kiya gaya he
 Know why you should watch a film if you are an adult, very big fan of Arbaaz Khan or Sunny Leone and if you do not miss any of their films, you can watch it once

 maharani elizabeth vaivaahik sthiti main, to unke bachche talaak dekar
 If the royal family of Britain is still called a family, it is only because God has made it royal
 varanaa maharani ke rajbhishek kii hirak jayanti par jo kuch hua, vah rang-birange paridhaanon se sajaa ek abhootpurv naatak hi tha
 This monarchy, which moved with full self-control from one century to another, is completely different from normal, and it should be so
 aakhir koi pili dhariyon vaali patalun pahanakar itihaas kaa hissaa banane kii soch kaise saktaa he, sivaay ek vajah ke ki ve house of windsar ke rajkumaar hon? sab kuch utana hi vaastavik tha jitna vah desh-kaal jisamen yah ghatana ghat rahi thi
 The rest was airborne
 kudarat ko bhi nahin pataa ki aisi ghatana isse pehle kabhi hui yaa nahin
 London rain is unique in its variety
 chaar din kii yah numaaish aisi hi barish or kaale badalon ke bich shuru hui
 No matter how much rain ravages the common people here, but even a single drop of it can spread the hair carefully with the queen's neatness? So as the Queen rose to enter the royal nouveau, the clouds stopped for a while
 nauka bhi aisi jaise khud kabhi cleopetra kii rahi ho, sone main madhi hui
 When a courtier trying to make himself appear very comfortable in front of the camera saw that now the rain had stopped, he asked the Queen with full respect and affection, "are you not shocked?" As the royal family lowers its voice during such talks, it suddenly raises its voice and the whole of Britain sinks in a wave of excitement
 itihaas kaa ek or dashak maharani ke naam ho gaya
 If a common French writer would have commented on the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, it would have probably indicated that her father had lost India, but in six decades, the Queen had broken the whole empire by her hand The evacuation, which emerged four centuries ago, when Elizabeth i gave a befitting reply to the Spanish fleet
 haalanki aisi anaavashyak baton ko pachaa janaa chahie
 Our contemporary Elizabeth is a traditionalist as well as a realist, which is why she took the pain of the nations going out of the empire one by one
 maharaniyon ko bhavuk nahin hona chahie, lekin chah dashak ke rajpaat main sirf ek cheez thi jo unhen dard de gai-jab unase unki nijee naav britania chin lee gai, jise 1954 main rajshahi samarthak winston churchill ne maharani ko diya tha lekin 1997 main tony blair ne waapas chin liya
 This was the only famous occasion when the Queen cried
 yaa kahen unhone apni ankhon ko nam hone diya tha
 It is well known that Mahara Ni smiles only during the race
 is baar koi res nahin thi lekin 3 june ko ve chahak rahi thim
 Britain's House of Windsor, with its glory so far, is left only because it has taken one thing into its mind that the monarchical heritage of the rest of Europe has not yet understood: that the blood is better than the power
 beesvin sadi kii uthapatak ke dauraan in rajshahiyon ne kabhi bhi vijay kaa daawa nahin kiya, lihaaja inhen inaki haar ke liye bhi jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 The European monarchy received some deep wounds in the First World War which ended in 1918
 is dauraan rus main rajshahi dhah gai
 The Hopsburg dynasty was also defeated in austro-hungary
 kaayjar shaskaon ko aatmasamarpan karnaa padaa
 The Windsor family vacated the land of power for politicians
 britain kii rajshahi jaanati thi ki janata ke liye vah ab apraasangik ho chuki thi
 But whenever it comes to affiliation with the subjects, it becomes difficult to look beyond Buckingham
 hirak jayanti samaaroh main kisi bhi netaa ko manch par nahin jane diya gaya, loktantric dhang se chune gaye britain ke pradhanmantriyon ko bhi nahin
 Democracy went on vacation here for a day
 lambey samay se is din kaa intjaar tha
 What was left when all the fireworks went up in smoke, the band's tunes stopped, and the next morning all the garbage was covered up? a meaning that cannot be stated in words
 britain kii janata kuch behatar mahasoos kar rahi thi- unki rajasatta ke pratik ne unka utsaah badha diya tha or jhulate aatmavishvaas ko tan kar khadey hone kaa mauka diya tha
 Depression does not happen to the British alone
 hamaare yahaan desh bhar main faile asantosh or bhrashtachar main dubi dilli ke bich agar koi aaj khush dikh jaae, to vah yaa to ashaavadi hoga yaa phir behad murkh
 Think that if the Indian people want to get inspiration and relief from the symbol of their state power, then who will be their hope? Pratibha Patil! This will be the slope of expectations
 ek hal he
 Why don't we bring a loan to the Queen of Britain for a few days? We will keep them here only in winter when Britain's weather is not sustainable
 unhen to ab bhi bharat ke saath jud kar khushi hi milti he
 His jewels come from the same Indian subcontinent: the Lahori diamond, which he emblazoned on the Diamond Jubilee, and the Kohinoor
 dilli main unhen jahaan rahanaa he yani raashtrapati bhawan, use bhi ek angrej ne hi banaaya tha, lihaaja apane hisaab se rahane main unhen dikkat bhi nahin hogi
 And the coronation in Delhi will also give him another reason to smile

 raveesh, aapke road sho main striyaan kyon nahin hoti hai? sahityakar maitreyi puspa kaa phone mujhe or pareshaan kar gaya
 a few days before that, a prime-time viewer's SMS came up about why women are not speaking
 ham or hamaari sahyogi sarvapriya sangwan road sho ke pehle hi din se ise lekar pareshaan the
 In a village in Saharanpur, i asked Sarvapriya to go inside the house and talk to women
 phir unke bare main ham alag se camere par baat karenge
 That is when Shama and Firdaus, two girls from that village, bring me out of the crowd of men and start telling their grief stories
 phir uske baad jo kahani banati he, wo chand minute pehle tak ban rahi mardaana zabaan kii kahani se bilkul alag dikhne lagati he
 NDTV viewers around the world get restless to help Shama and Firdaus
 lekin iske baad dhire-dhire hamaari kahani se auraten gaayab hone lagati hai
 Our watchful audience begins to notice
 baar-baar maang aane lagati hai ki auraten kyon nahin bol rahi hai
 We also started wondering why women are not speaking
 jab bhi mohammad mursalin kaa camera kisi choukhat kii taraf ghumta he, dahleez par khadi auraten yaa ladkiyaan peeche hat jaati hai
 i have to tell men or boys that you don't come with us, you have to talk to women

 Follow you back and forth

 State who will vote
 mard bolne ke liye uksaate bhi hai or kya bolnaa he, yah bhi bolne lagate hai
 Women and girls start to hesitate
 bolne ke liye kuch bol detii hai
 This is certainly not his natural expression
 hamane sochaa ki ab iske liye ranneeti banani hogi
 As soon as we enter a village, we are surrounded by boys or men
 inamen se kai log to aam log hote hai, magar kai raajnneetik dalon ke chatur kaaryakarta, jo aam aadmi ke bhesh main apni party kaa bakhaan karne lagate hai
 Speak loudly, our leader has a wave
 aam log saham jate hai or unki pratikriya swaabhaavik nahin rah jaati he
 We have to go from one crowd to another
 kahana padataa he ki aap yaheen rukiye, hamen nae logon se baat kerani he
 There is a natural conversation with new people for some time, but there also remains a man's possession
 ham apni ranneeti phir badalte hai
 Now we start reaching a village without telling it
 phir bhi auraton se baat karne kii samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin miltaa
 Men finally come out
 unhen sab pataa he
 On entering the village, the first question is whether we have come to survey or to take a statement
 bayaan kii bhashaa vahi, jo akhabaaron or tivi kii he
 As soon as we start insisting that you guys go we have to talk to girls
 ve log jane kii bajaay camere ke saath-saath auraton ko gher lete hai
 How strange
 pachaas fisadi aabaadi kii koi awaz nahin he
 So much struggle to reach it
 isse pataa chalata he ki gaanv, kasbon ke chowk-chauraahon or raaston par mardon kaa hi kabza barkaraar he
 The same people get around
 is baar ham pahunchate hai elahabaad ke hamidia girls college
 We request the principal that we have to talk to the girls and when we talk to them, you will not be there either
 wo maan to jaati hai, magar kahati hai ki imtahaan chal rahe hai
 Still she calls some girls from homes
 ham un ladakiyon ke saath college kii duusari manzil par ek class room main pahunchate hai
 As the camera turns on the recording, we glance at the professor sitting behind the girls' circle
 main unhen bhi kamare se jane ke liye kah detaa hum
 Even after they leave, the girls' nervousness does not subside
 kuch ladakiyon ek-duusare ke peeche chhipane kii koshish karti nazar ain
 i gave them a lot of time to get back to normal, after a long time they started opening up
 apane sapanom, mushkilon or mohallon ke bare main baat karne lageen
 Looking at the TV and Twitter, it seems that the democracy of India is so blatant, whereas in reality it is not
 pachaas fisadi aabaadi ko bolne ke liye spes kahaan he, jagah kahaan he? ladakiyon kii takadir badalane ke liye hamidia college bana tha
 That college once again showed us a new way to reach girls
 is prakriya main hamane ek khaas baat note kii he
 Shakya went to Mainpuri village to make a report on the political consciousness of the society
 vahaan hamane dekha ki anusuchit jati kii auraten kaaphi mukhar hai
 Especially of Jatav society
 unki raajnneetik praathamikta kaaphi spasht thi lekin pichde samaaj main aane vaale shaakyon kii auraten abhi utani mukhar nahin hui hai
 In order to reach them, we have to run away by scolding a crowd of men
 dur jane ke liye kahana padataa he
 i arrive with Mike to talk to a woman named Shashi Devi standing in a thatched hut
 is baar mohammad mursalin jaanboojh kar camere ko auraton se bahut dur rakhte hai
 The conversation begins
 unki madad ke liye hamaari sahyogi sarvapriya sangwan jhopadi main aa jaati hai
 Women are encouraged
 dhire-dhire khulne lagati hai
 Their conversation shows that they decide their vote at the behest of the head or husband
 pradhan kaise unke vot kaa sauda karata he, yah nahin maaloom
 He has no other expectations from his politicians other than the brick road ahead of the house
 loktantr main jatigat samaajon kii raajnneetik bhagidaari se hi us samaaj ke mardon or auraton kii raajnneetik abhivyakti badalati he
 For this, caste consciousness is very important
 jatigat chetana se hi wo aatmavishvaas banataa he, jo loktantr ko vividh bana detaa he
 Despite the fact that caste consciousness further rooted democratic consciousness
 dhire-dhire 'raveesh kaa road sho' main aurato ko jagah milane lagati hai
 In the villages we visit, there are many women who have seen road shows
 hamane paaya ki unka aatmavishvaas badla hua tha
 In a village of Azamgarh, a woman sends a child and calls our team from a group of men
 andar bithakar apni beti ke saath hone vaali pareshaaniyon ko saajha karti he
 In this district, we meet a radio jockey named Rahat, who runs a community radio called Voice of Azamgarh
 raahat banaras se azamgarh naukari karne ai he
 This is his first escape
 ek maukey ne uski jindagi badali, to ab wo azamgarh kii un auraton kii awaz bananaa chaahati he, jinke pati kaam kii talash main arab deshon main palaayan kar gaye hai
 It means to say that after trying a little, we start listening to the voice of women
 unka nazariyaa saamne aane lagata he
 In 'ravish Ka Roadshow' we constantly start saying that wherever we go, we are surrounded by men
 puraa janamat mardaana ho jaataa he
 Public opinion is not being recorded at all
 unki aakankshaayen, unki shikaayatein, unki bechainiyaan sab gaayab
 How can a road show be complete without talking to half the population
 is baar aap darshakon ne ise mukammal banaaya he
 i know that there are more women and girls watching NDTV India
 jab unke ek esemes or phone se mere road sho main itnaa badlaav aa saktaa he, to unki ek baat se hamaara loktantr kitna vividh ho saktaa he
 Maitreyi Pushpa's voice is still echoing in my ears, "ravish, why are there no women in your show?"

 Controversy has arisen again over the death of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) founder Kanshi Ram
 kanshiram ke parijanon ne mayawati ko unki maut kaa jimmevaar bataate hue mayawati ke adhyaksh rahane tak bispi ko vot nahin dene kaa elaan kiya he
 His family also accused Mayawati of not allowing Kanshi Ram and his mother to meet each other
 bispi supremeo mayawati ko aam chunaav ladakar jeetne kii chunauti dete hue kanshiram ke parijanon ne sawaal uthaaya ki kanshiram kii maut ke baad mayawati kabhi bhi koi chunaav kyon nahin ladi
 Although the Bahujan Samaj Party is claiming to form a Third Front government with its support at the Center, this claim has been put in the dock by the family of the party's founder
 jisaki vajah se mayawati kii mushkilen bad sakati hai
 Actually the party's founder Kanshi Ram's family has raised serious questions on Mayawati's style of work
 kanshi kii maut par us vaqt bhi kai sawaal uthe the or kai tarah ke vivaad bhi hue the, lekin abhi tak bottle main band is vivaad kaa jinn dobaaraa baahar nikal aayaa he
 Kanshi Ram's family, describing Mayawati as a dictator, blamed him for Kanshi Ram's death
 parivaar ne mayawati par aarope lagaaya he ki unhone kanshiram par party adhyaksh pad ke liye dawaab daalaa tha
 He also called Mayawati the post of Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh as Kanshi Ram
 unhone kanshiram kii jindagi ko samaaj or party ke prati samarpit hone kaa daawa karte hue kaha ki ve desh or samajahit main aksar vyast rahete the
 If we believe the family's words, then Kanshi Ram took Mayawati forward, to show her things, she also showed some unseen pictures of Kanshi Ram and Mayawati
 in tasveeron main mayawati ke kai alag-alag andaaj nazar aae
 Kanshi Ram's sister Swarn Kaur says, the brother formed a party, struggled 40 years and suffered a lot of suffering
 hamaara samaaj saath joda, ab pradhan mayawati ban gai hai jabardastee, dhokhe se beemaari ke bahaane pradhan pad le liya
 Those who were close to his brother, who gave life to make a party, he dropped such people from the party
 tarah-tarah ke iljaam lagaakar hajaaron kii sankhya main aise logon ko baahar kiya gaya
 We also have grief for our brother, whom he has tortured and killed
 wo aise hi nahin mara, teen saal biimaar rahaa, ek saal pehle usne bhai kii jubaan band kara di
 Mayawati gives us an answer as to why my brother's tongue remained closed for a year
 mere bhai ke saath jo usne kiya wo main bhuluungi nahin jab tak main zindaa hum
 Not only this, the family accused Mayawati of separating her son from her mother and said that after Kanshi Ram's illness, Mayawati never allowed Kanshi Ram's mother to live with him
 kanshiram kii bahan swarna cor kaa ye bhi aarope he ki mayawati ke kaaran hi unki maa apane bete ke gam main chal basii
 Referring to the painful death of his mother, he told that when actor Amitabh Bachchan went to meet his mother after his illness during Kanshi Ram's illness and his mother was also watching TV when this news went on TV
 isi dauraan unki maa bhavuk ho gayin or unhen apane bete kanshiram kaa dhyaan aa gaya, lekin beemaari main bhi apane bete se nahin milane ke gam main unhen doharaa heart atake aayaa
 Despite being treated, he could not be saved and died
 swarna cor apni maa kii is maut kaa jimmedaar bhi mayawati ko maanati hai
 The resentment of Kanshi Ram's family increased to such an extent that his sister and nephew, while playing the rebellion against Mayawati, have even announced not to vote for the party as their party president
 haalanki unhone apni naaraazgi mayawati tak hi simit bataai, unhone kaha ki party se unki kisi bhi tarah kii koi naaraazgi nahin he
 Not only this, he also accused Mayawati of forgetting the party's founding family as well as the party's dedicated workers and promoting the money offerings
 kanshiram ke parijan bispi ko vot nahin dene kaa elaan karte hue bhi mayawati ko kanshiram kii maut kaa jimmedaar bataane kii baat ko doharaana nahin bhoolatey

 The Modi government shut down the 80:20 gold import scheme was launched in August 2013, then changes were made in February 2014 and the most shocking thing is that May 14 was just two days before the general election results in 2014
 It was decided to carry forward the scheme and after the defeat of UPA, its notification was also issued on 21 May
 sutron kii maane to samiti kii ore se sieji report ke aadhaar par jaanch kii jaaegi
 Why did former Finance Minister Chidambaram make three changes in the plan, there was no intention to benefit the gold importing companies behind it

 You must remember that evergreen song, in which earlier there was a hint in the eyes and there was support to live sitting
 magar upi main yogi ji kii police ab to bas ankhen dekh kar bataa detii he ki kiski ankhen gustakhiyaan kar rahi hai or kiski ankhen sharafat main jhuk yaa uth rahi hai
 Just understand that the eyes of the UP Police have suddenly got snapped and sharp too
 tabhi to un ankhon ne ye daawa kiya he ki wo un ankhon ko, ankhon hi ankhon main pahchaan lengi jo sadakchhaap romeo yaa majanuun liye ghoomte hai
 That is, Naina will not cheat in UP, but Naina will take it
 ek ankhen or itnaa hunar, magar har ankhon main ye hunar kahaan
 This style in the eyes gives the top only to a select few eyes
 jinke paas ye ankhen hai, un ankhon se panaah mangiye
 Because these eyes know the secret by putting eyes in eyes
 ankhon kaa yahi hunar upi ke thanedaaron kii ankhon main utar aayaa he
 Extremely connoisseur, so much so that these eyes tell whether the eyes are family or street print
 ye ankhen ehatraam karengi yaa rusavaa karengi
 Do not know where these talented eyes were hidden for so many years
 kaash ki ye pehle mil gai hoti to upi main kabhi chor chori na kar paata
 Lafanga girls do not tease
 khooni khun na kar paata
 Just understand that the state of Ram which came now in UP, it would have come long ago
 magar pataa nahin kahaan chuphi huin thi ye ankhen
 Well, now you have received, so thank the above
 aap to bas aam khaaie guthliyon se aapako kya matlab
 These policemen of UP said that if they recognize Romeo with eyes, then the matter is over
 usamen hairaan hone kii kya zarurat he
 Experience is also something or not and we have heard many people say that the policemen of UP have eyes, not eyes, but X-ray machines
 UP police kii najaron se bachanaa mushkil haihaan sahi to he ankhen dekhakar ab itnaa to andaaza lagaaya hi ja saktaa he ki ram koun he or romeo koun
 But if you ask again and again that if the UP police was so capable, then why is UP so infamous
 choron or mujarimon ko pakadaney main bhale thodi der lage magar manchalon ko pakadaney main upi police ko maharath he
 That is why in a week and a half, by identifying with the eyes, the policemen have created fear in the community of the people
 yogi adityanath ke soobe kaa mukhiya banate hi ye manchalon par nakel kasne kii muhim purazor tareeke se amal main laai ja rahi he
 Lessons have been taught to one and a half thousand from school to college, from market to coaching, the police are tightening the screws with their eyes
 naa kisi saboot kii jarurat naa koi gavaah chahie, kyonki ye to bas ek nazar aapako dekhenge or bataa denge ki aapaki nazaron main khot thi
 The UP Police has not only identified those rogue eyes with their detective eyes, but has also taught a lesson to the stray lovers with more than a thousand bad eyes
 par abhi bhi agar aapako samaj nahin aayaa ki ankhon se ankhon kii ye jang upi police ne kaise jiti to aap hamaare saath aaie, ham bataaengen ki upi main naina kaise dhare ja rahe hai
 Road side Romeo, now be careful, with the changing of the Nizam as well as the attitude of the police, it is clear that no matter how much disguise can be changed, but do not take care of the police from the eye nor expect mercy
 kyonki ab upi main road said romeo kaa guzar-basar mushkil he
 From the capital of the state to every small and big city, the police has spying eyes
 magar kuch to aisa hoga upi police kii in jasusi ankhon main jo ek nazar main ye road said romeos ko bhaanp lete hai
 Now what skill is that, it would be better to listen in their own tongue
 har skool-college ke baahar police kii ye parkhi nazaren mustaid hai
 The police's formula is a little unique, don't be mistaken that they will miss out on identifying Romeo, because their formula is a little unique
 upi main pehle jin jagahon par sadak chhap majanuon kaa raaj hua karata tha, vahaan saadi vardi main ai anti romeo sqoid unheen kii jamaat main shaamil hokar unhen daboch rahi he
 Whether the Romeo's whereabouts or their identity, the UP Police has put out its own methods
 cigarette pine or kapade ke pahanane ke tareeke se bhi ab police bhaanp le rahi he ki manchala koun he
 So be careful, sir, laugh too with full respect
 kyonki pahchaan topuliceko manchalon kii hansi
 Gesture and style are also there
 romeo ab badal len pradeshsirf samajhaayaa hi ja saktaa he ki road said romeo philhal yaa to harakatein badal len yaa phir pradesh badal len, kyonki philhal to aisi koi bhi harakat bahut mahangi pad sakati he
 There are all kinds of Romeos in the street and the types of Romeos in UP, the police have the same formulas to identify them
 mumkin he ki agar koi manchala kisi ladki ke saath budtameezi kar rahaa ho wo pulisavaali ho yaa jis ladke ke bagal main khadaa hokar chhedhkhani kii ja rahi ho wo thanedaar ho
 Because the anti-romeo squad of the state is in full action
 kanfus he UP puliceskul yaa phir college jaati ladakiyon ke saath chhedchhad karne waalon ko rokna to sahi he, lekin ye tay kar paanaa yakeenan ek mushkil kaam he ki koun ladki ko ched rahaa he or koun ladki kii marji se usase mil rahaa he
 Or who is going through some work in front of a girls' school or college
 bas yahi wo talwaar kii dhar he, jis par in dinon upi police chal rahi he
 The police is not sparing even those who are going along freely in this attempt to curb the molesters who molest girls
 sach kahen to asal main police kanfus he, isliye chhedchhad karne vaale ladakon ke alaava police har jode ko roak rahi he
 At the moment, through this operation, the road side Romeo is being punished without any strict action
 magar hidaayat de di gai he ki agar aage se parkon main mohabbat karte dikhe to bahut mushkil hogi

 In the post-mortem report Mahendra Karmaki was revealed to give a shiver to the spirit regarding the Naxalite attack in Chhattisgarh
 pataa chalaa he ki unke shariq par naksaliyon ne sangeenon se 78 waar kiye the or unke sharir se mili he 65 goliyaan
 Not only this, after Karma's murder, Naxalites danced on his body
 ye naksalwad nahin antakawaad he
 This is not even terrorism, but it is also Zionism
 jis tarah se naksaliyon ne mahendra karma kii hatya kii uski sachai ruh ko kampa dene vaali he
 Mahendra Karma, through the Salwa Judum, the Naxalites did two or two hands but when they reached the hands of the Naxalites, they were killed in a terrible way
 chashmadidon ke mutabik jab 26 may ko jab mahendra karma naksaliyon ke haath lage to congressiyon par tabadatod firing ko dekhakar wo gaadi se utre or unhone apane saathiyon ko bakhshane kii guhaar kii
 Despite the surrender, the Naxalites treated Mahendra Karma in such a way that humanity would be shocked
 unhen pehle to eke 47 kii goliyon se bhun diya gaya
 Then Karma's lifeless body was adopted by the naxalites in the gun
 postmortem report ke mutabik karma ke sharir main 78 nishaan mili he
 The brutality of Naxalites did not stop here
 iske baad unhone mahendra karma ke shav par naachna shuru kar diya
 Shiva Narayan Dwivedi, an eyewitness of the incident, said, 'this was the matter in front of me
 maarane ke baad main unke bandook ke saamne jo rahata he usase god rahe the saare naksali

 or uske upar wo naachte the
 Meaning there was a bad scene
 ye sachhee ghatana he ye
 According to doctors, 65 pills have been found in Mahendra Karma's body
 unka sharir jab postmortem ke liye pahunchaa to doctor bhi hairat main pads gaye ki koi kisi ke shav ke saath itani amanviya harakat kaise kar saktaa he
 One of the motives behind the manner in which the Naxalites carried out this incident was to create panic among the people so that no one else would run a campaign like Salwa Judum against them

 Basic education officer Balmunkud, who reached the school, said that the recognition of this school was canceled almost a year ago, that is, this school was closed in the government papers, still the school was running, and on Monday the young children It was exam day

 Coming a bit closer to his time, it was often said that Indian dynasty has shown that democracy here is still stuck in the same rut that disrupted British politics 300 years ago
 vah jamaana jab nirvachan kshetra bahut chote hote the, itane chote ki prayek voter ko nijee rup se ghoose di ja sake
 i believe that Indian democratic dynasty grew up because it suited the prevailing conditions
 ve aadhunik rajnatik hibrids yaa sankar hai
 There is no doubt that dynasties abound in India
 sabase spasht udhaaharan nehru-gandhi khandaan he jo congress party par prabhutv rakhata he
 It is generally credited to Indira Gandhi that she transformed the Congress into a family business, but in her recently published autobiography, Kuldeep Nayar says that Lal Bahadur Shastri believed that Nehru had dynastic aspirations
 , They wanted their daughter to be their heir

 Britain has recently seen a tremendous attraction towards the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Elizabeth and if there is any dynasty there, they are its successors
 honkong uniwarsity main professor mark aar
 Thompson has argued in an article on Asian dynasty that he is not following an 'old-fashioned way'
 unhone kaha ki vanshavaad aadhunik rajnatik vyavastha main bhi utana hi kargar he kyonki isamen ''viraasat main mili karishme ke aadhaar par logon ko aakarshith kiya jaataa he jisase netritv ke uttaradhikaar ko vaid banane main madad milti he or sanghathanaatmak vibhaajan ko kam se kam kiya ja saktaa he
 "people from dynasties in India have occupied parties
" mujhe yaad he ki jab maine ek varisht congressi netaa ko yah suzav diya ki jab rajeev gandhi kii kismat sabase kharaab daur main thi, party ko unase pallaa jhad lenaa chahie tha
 Congress leaders were shocked to hear this
 unhone kaha, ''nehru-gandhi parivaar party kaa mukhya stambh he
 By excluding them, the party will collapse
 '' iske baad kai ghatnaon ne unki is baat ko sahi sabit kiya
 After the Ayodhya movement, the party was on the verge of collapse, but party leader Arjun Singh called Prime Minister P
P

 Started his campaign against Narasimha Rao
 aapako bataa den, jaahir taur par anicchhuk dikh raheen vansh parampara kii agali kadi sonia gandhi ne parade ke peeche se narsingh raav kii satta ko kund karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Who knows where the Congress would have been today if Sonia Gandhi had not come in the middle and regained control of the family party? Indian leaders need a strong leader to remain in discipline
 bijepi main kai aise netaa honge jo apni netavihin party kaa sankat dekhakar yah sochate honge ki kaash! atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa koi vanshaj hota
 The Congress is in trouble because Indira Gandhi has made a rule that no Congress leader will be allowed to run regional dynasties, so that no one becomes powerful enough to challenge like Karunanidhi
 is saal uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav main kshetreey vansh parampara kaa netaa na hone ke kaaran congress ko do kaaphi majboot vanshavaadi netaaon mulaayam or mayawati se ladane ke liye puri tarah se rahul gandhi ke karishme par hi nirbhar rahanaa padaa
 Mayawati can also be considered the leader of dynastic tradition because of the will that her party founder Kanshi Ram gave her in her will
 kya uttar pradesh main koi chamatkaar kar paane main rahul gandhi kii vifaltaa kaa matlab yah he ki unka koi jaadu nahin he, koi khandaani karishma nahin he? lekin unhen dekhne ke liye jo bheed jutati thi vah iske vipareet sankawt detii he
 But lazy Congress leaders who have always depended on the charisma of the nehru-gandhi dynasty to win elections, have forgotten that charisma alone is not enough to get votes and that a reliable convention of voter turnout cannot be achieved from the crowd
 1991 ke chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan rajeev gandhi ke saath jhansi se kanpur kii yatra ke dauraan maine dekha ki vishaal, utsaahi bheed unako gher leti thi or dhakkamukki main kai baar main girte-girte bachataa tha
 i started to believe that the election was in his favor
 lekin nateezon ne yah sankawt diya ki yadi unki hatya kii dukhad ghatana nahin hui hoti to congress agali sarkaar nahin bana paati or sahanubhuti voton ke baad bhi use purna bahumat hasil nahin ho paaya
 Caste is mostly associated with leaders of regional dynasties, and both Congress and BJP work according to their caste arithmetic
 vaise to duniyabar main isaki aalochana kii jaati he, lekin vanshavaadi loktantr jatiyon main aisi kranti laa sakaa he jisase paramparaagat taur par sattavihin rahane vaale log bhi shashakt ho gaye hai
 But India's strong family tradition, quite different from the single families of the West, justifies dynasty in the eyes of the voters
 bharat main ise kaaphi swaabhaavik or sweekaarya mana jaataa he ki kisi bhi tarah kaa adhikaar rakhane vaale pita or mata apane bete yaa beti ko use saunp de
 Inder Malhotra explains it very well
 apni pustak dianastes of engia and biyand main ve kehete hai, ''vanshavaad kii mukhar alpsankhyak bhartsana khaskar bharat main zyada tej he or iskaa mukhya lakshya nehru-gandhi parivaar he
 But this is really no comparison to the silence of the sober majority public
 upmahadweep kii jansankhya kaa bada hissaa rajnatik satta kii viraasat maa-baap se santan ko dene main kuch bhi aapattijanak nahin maanata
 "inder describes this silent majority as" socially blunt "
 yah mujhe apmanjanak lagata he, ek aisi vyakhya jo is aadhaar par tiki he ki bhartiya loktantr saamanti or pichhadaa he
 Instead, i consider dynasties as fulfilling the needs of the present times in India, which preserve democracy while providing some degree of stability
 bhavishya kii baat karen to mujhe ummid he ki vanshavaad kaa mahatv kam hoga, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki bharat ko aankh mundakar pashchimi loktantr ko apana lenaa chahie
 After all, America, which is the loudest noise about democracy, can be called a money system, and this is because there is a lot of money needed to be a big player in politics

 adaalat ne kaha he ki yachikakarta is maamle main hoicourt bhi ja sakate hai
 Why the mlas were disqualified (state of Karnataka Legislative Assembly)? It is worth mentioning that 14 Congress, 3 JDS mlas resigned in Karnataka amid the government pullout
 isi ke baad vidhansabha spikar ramesh kumaar ne 17 vidhayakon ko ayogy qaraar diya tha
 After which by-elections were to be held on these seats

 main is chunauti ko sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar hum

 kejariwal ne janata se anurodh kiya ki modi ko yahaan se or rahul gandhi ko amethi se haraaen, taaki endie or upie donon ko jhatka lage
 He said, 'these are two armies, one is named UPA and the other is named NDA

 If you defeat both Modi and Rahul, these forces will collapse automatically
