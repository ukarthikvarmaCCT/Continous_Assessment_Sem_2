 Along with this, the Government of India officials assured that complete security arrangements will be made regarding the corridor and that care will be taken to ensure that there is no intrusion through the corridor

 cyna ke smash ke court se baahar jane se inthanon ne 10-7 se badhat bana lee thi or phir ise 16-10 kar diya
 At this time, Saina was struggling in front of the Thailand player and all the points she scored were met by the mistakes of the opponent
 sina pichley saal sudiraman cap main inthanon se haar gayi thi
 The difference widened in favor of 17-year-old Inthanon, as the Thailand player was steadily covering the court with shots
 12-19 se pichhadane vaali cyna ne ubarne kii koshish kii or vipakshi kii kuch galatiyon se is antar ko 17-19 kar diya
 On the net, Saina was the better of the two players, but Inthanon put up seven smash winners against the Indian, while Saina could manage only one
 isse thailand kii duusari variya khilaadi ne yah game apane naam kiya
 In the second game, luck changed to Saina with the change of ends and this Indian took advantage by forcing Inthanon to make mistakes
 cyna ne chaar net vinar se 8-3 se badhat bana lee, inthanon unke shaat kii teji se sanmjasy nahin bitha saki
 In this game, Saina put up 12 net winners while only three players from Thailand were able to collect
 inthanon ne pehle game main jo urjavan pradarshan kiya tha, vah ise duusare game main jari nahin rakh paayi lekin cyna ko iskaa shrey milegaa, jinhone khud ko game kii teji ke hisaab se dhaal liya
 Inthanon smashed the bassline easily in the first game, but he was not successful in this game and he was falling on the net
 cyna ne lay main vaapasi karte hue kuch aakraamak shaat lagaakar 16-12 se badhat bana lee
 Inthanon did not give up so easily and made the difference 15–17, but Saina scored four consecutive points to equalize 1–1
 tisare or nirnaayak game main cyna kaaphi tej thi or unhone 3-0 kii badhat ko 11-4 kar diya
 Inthanon's net game was not so strong and Saina scored eight points from a superb net game to take a 17-7 lead
 cyna ne 17-10 ke score ke baad apana pasandida smash vinar lagaaya or lagaataar chaar ank jutakar khitaab apni jholii main daalaa

 In fact, the Chief Minister's convoy was jammed three times in the past week, with the intention of improving the bad traffic system for years, the Chief Minister himself directed the authorities to close the cut of many main roads while coming down the road
 adhikariyon ne bhi tatparta dikhaate hue raaton raat in kats ko band karvaa diya
 In such a situation, when people opened their eyes in the morning, they were stunned to see the new traffic system

 The terror of man-eating tigress is spread in Uttarakhand's Ramnagar these days
 van vibhaag ne aadamkhor baghin ko maarane ke liye ab tak kaa sabase bada abhiyaan chalaaya he
 At present, the man-eating tigress is still left in the eyes of the forest department
 ramnagar ke ampokhara range main aadamkhor baghin ne pichley 38 dinon se aatank machaaya hua he
 The department has so far spent more than Rs 50 lakh to kill the tigress
 abhiyaan main helicopter ke saath ek drone, teen hathi, saat pinjre or sau se zyada camaron ke saath 150 se adhik vanakarmi din-raat jute hue hai
 The man-eating tigress has so far made two people her morsel
 saath hi baghin ke hamale main teen log gambhir rup se ghayal ho chuke hai, jisase aasapaas ke gaanvon main dehshat kaa maahaul he
 Adamkhor, a synonymous with terror, also escaped safely by dodging poachers and forest workers
 baghin ko maarane ke liye gorakhpur gaanv main bachade ko baandha gaya tha
 Forest department employees were also deployed along with the realities to hunt for the tigress
 baghin tadake subah kareeb 4:30 baje bachade ke paas ai or use ghayal kar diya, lekin shikari ek baar phir baghin ko maarane se chook gaye

 ' Dr
 paraag madhukar dhakaate ne aage kaha ki philhal aadamkhor baghin kii talash jari he or jald hi use maar giraaya jayega

 Please tell that every day the villagers are passing through terror in fear of tigress

 Mahesh Vyas says that this rule should be applied to all companies
 mahesh vyas in companiyon kaa data dekhne ke baad kehete hai ki naukari bhi kam ho rahi he or selary bhi
 Compensation (salary etc

 6 pratishat kii dar se badi
 This is the worst average in three years
 jis sarvice sector main sailariyaan kaaphi badhati thim vahaan tehraav dekha ja rahaa he
 Jobs and investment in large corporates have declined significantly
 iske baad bhi narendra modi ko aarthik nitiyon ke sandarbh main mahaan bataaya ja rahaa he
 It is possible that Modi is important for the unemployed, not a job
 chunaav kii reporting karne nikle kai patrakaron ne bhi likhaa he ki berojgaar yuva kahata he ki uske liye bada sawaal rashtriya suraksha kaa he
 Not unemployed
 berojgaare kisi bhi lokapriy netaa ko daraa detii he
 Decreases popularity
 agar media report sahi he, unase naujavaanon ne yahi kaha he to phir narendra modi kaa yah kamaal hi mana jayega ki unhone berojgaaron ke bich hi berojgaare kaa mudda khatm kar diya
 Very few leaders are able to do this
 thodaa shrey berojgaaron ko bhi milanaa chahie ki ve is tang haalat main apni raajnneetik nishtha nahin badal rahe hai
 It is not easy to do this
 main kai bankeron se mila
 Their working conditions have deteriorated

 Of course many bankers consider Modi responsible for this, but among them there are many bankers who are still doing Modi
 is tarah kii lokapriyata kam netaaon ko milti he
 Putting your political support above economic trouble says something else
 agar modi jitate hai to in kaarnon kaa bhi bada yogadan hoga
 It is generally believed that if he gets a job, he will be anti-modi
 naukari nahin milegi to modi virdohi ho jayega or selary nahin badhegi to modi virdohi ho jayega
 Modi's increasing or sustained popularity among the unemployed in surveys and journalists' reports is that such voters do not have pockets in their minds
 modi hai
 If that's the case then that's a big deal

 com punjab ke deraa baba nanak main sarhad paar se aatankiyon kii ghuspaith!9 november ko kartarpur sahab coridor kaa hona he udghaatanpakistan sarhad par napak harkaton se baj nahin aa rahaa
 Intelligence agencies report has revealed that infiltration notices of terrorists have been reported around Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district of Punjab
 deraa baba nanak main 9 november ko kartarpur sahab coridor kaa udghaatan hona he
 The agencies issued alerts India Today TV, according to information received from sources, agencies responsible for monitoring the international border have been alerted about this
 inamen border security force (biguef) bhi shaamil he
 Prior to this report of intelligence agencies, the input of BSF came that there was a huge movement in terrorist camps located in Mudrikke, Shakurgarh and Norowal, Pakistan
 iske alaava pehle bhi ikhlaspur or shakurgarh se aatankiyon kii gatividhiyaan tej hone par report aati rahi hai
 According to sources attached to the security establishment, BSF and other security agencies have been informed about the latest penetrations
 is sambandh main vistrut report dene ke liye kaha gaya he
 It has also been asked how such incidents are possible in the Punjab sector if fresh incursions have actually taken place
 kya aapako pataa he ki bainkon ko phir se 410 arab rupee die ja rahe hai? vitt mantri jetali ne sansad se iske liye anumati maangi he
 Not only this, the government had made a provision of 650 billion in the budget to give to the banks
 bainkon kii bhashaa main ise capital inflo kaha jaataa he
 Why does the government want to give 1 lakh crore rupees to banks in a year? If you read any analysis, the answer will be that the loans given earlier by the banks were not repaid
 phir se lone dene ke liye paise nahin hai
 Therefore, the government is giving money to banks on its behalf so that money can be available for loans in the market
 kisne lone lekar nahin chukaaye hai or kise nayaa lone dena he, in do sawaalon ke jawaab se sabakuch saaf ho jayega
 Is this not a loan waiver in the name of Capital Inflow? The Reserve Bank of India had put 11 state-run banks on its list of prompt actions
 in sabhi se kaha gaya tha ki ve enpie khaaton kii pahchaan karen, lone ko vasulein, jo lone na de us company ko bech den or nayaa lone dena band kar den
 When the NPA of the banks exceeded the specific limit, it was stopped because the banks could drown
 ab hangaamaa hua ki jab bank lone nahin denge to arthvyavastha kii raftaar ruk jaaegi
 But why are these industrialists asking for loans from state-run banks, why not take them from private ones? Why is the government putting a lakh crore rupees in government banks for them? On waiving the loan of the farmer, it is said that no one will repay the loan
 yahi baat in udyogpatiyon se kyon nahin kahi jaati he? sitambar 2018 main bainkon kaa non parfarming asset 8 lakh 69 hazaar karod kaa ho gaya he
 There has been some decrease compared to June 2018 because then NPA was 8 lakh 74 thousand crores
 lekin sitambar 2017 main bainkon kaa enpie 7 lakh 34 hazaar karod tha
 Most of the npas of banks are due to non-repayment of loans by these industrialists
 kya vaaki reserve bank kii sakhti ke kaaran bainkon ne lone dena band kar diya he? bijness standard main tamal bandhopadhyaay kaa sampadakeey lekh chapa he
 He has written that the pace of lending to the bank sector has increased
 15 pratishat ho gaya he
 Double the speed of GDP
 phir sarkaar ko kyon lagata he ki yah kaaphi nahin he
 Banks should lend more
 1 lakh karod jab sarkari bainkon ko milegaa tab ve reserve bank kii nigaraanee se mukt ho jaaenge
 Their hands will open again to give loans
 sarkaar bainkon ko 1986 se paise dete rahi he, lekin uske baad bhi bank kabhi puunji sankat se baahar nahin aa sake
 Between 1986 and 2017, one lakh crore rupees have been given in banks
 11 saal main ek lakh karod se adhik kii raashi di jaati he
 Now the same amount will be given to banks within a year
 bijness standard ke ek or lekh main debashish basu ne likhaa he ki yah sidhaa-sidhaa daan tha
 It had nothing to do with the performance improvement of banks
 das lakh karod kaa enpie ho gaya, iske liye na to koi netaa doshi tehraaya gaya or na bank ke sheersh adhikari
 Leaders always want banks to have money so that they can get loans to their loved ones under pressure, which is never back
 debashish basu ne modi sarkaar ke shuruuaati faisalon main se ek kii ore dhyaan dilaayaa he
 23 district cooperative banks in four states were to be revived
 in sabhi ke paas license nahin the
 16 out of 23 banks were in UP
 niyamon ke anusaar in sabko band kar diya janaa tha magar sarkaar ne inhen chalaane kii anumati di

 bina license ke sahakaarita bank khulavaa dene kaa khel kya he, ise main bhi samajhane kaa prayaas karuunga
 Tamal Bandhopadhyay has written that do banks know to lend? Probably not

 It is not right to blame the state of the economy because private banks also work in this environment
 unke enpie kii haalat itani buree kyon nahin he? unhone likhaa he ki sarkaar bainkon ko jo lakh lakh karod detii he vah kisaanon kii qarz maafi se koi alag nahin he
 If the government continues to put capital in banks in the same way, will the pressure on industrialists to repay the loan not be lightened, just as farmers will not give loan
 bijness standard kii ek or report par gaur karne kii zarurat he
 Abhishek Waghmare and Sanjib Mukherjee report that since the promise of loan waiver of farmers in the UP elections, more than two lakh crore loans have been announced in seven states so far
 lekin maharashtra, upi, punjab or karnataka main 40 pratishat kisaanon kaa hi lone maaf hua he
 Two states belong to BJP and two to Congress
 uttar pradesh main laghu or seemaant kisaanon ke ek lakh tak ke karz maaf hone the
 The verdict was announced in April 2017
 daawa kiya gaya tha ki 86 lakh kisaanon ko laabh hoga
 It will cost 364 billion rupees
 lekin 21 maheene biit jane ke baad maatr 44 lakh kisaanon kii hi karz maafee hui he
 Not only this, since the loan waiver, the loan given on farming in these four states also reduces
 is report ko padhie to kaaphi kuch samaj aayega
 It is important for Hindi readers to use different and different types of sources to understand the issues
 tabhi samaj aayega ki das lakh karod kaa lone nahin chukaane vaale chand mutthi bhar log mouj kar rahe hai
 To give them more loans, the government is giving 1 lakh crore to public sector banks
 kisaanon ke lone maaf hote hai, kabhi puure nahin hote hai, hote bhi hai to unhen karz milane se roka jane lagata he
 There is no problem in giving loans to the industrialists, the problem is not the repayment of the loan and even after that the governments are laying down to give a new loan
 phir kyon kisaanon kii baat aati he to middle class latife banane lagata he
 It is good to read ten to five articles from different sources, the quality of the debate will be better than the ones

 There are also indications of Hazare meeting Congress President Sonia Gandhi soon
 unhen guuruuvaar ko sonia ke saath baithak kerani thi, lekin congress adhyaksh ke karyaalay se unhen mulaakaat kaa vakt nahin mil paaya
 On the other hand, before the all-party meeting on July 3, the NDA will meet on Saturday, in which the strategy of the opposition alliance will be decided on the issue of Lokpal
 hazaare paksh ne buudhvaar ko rajg sanyojak or jad-you netaa sharad yadav, makapa mahasachiv prakaash karaat or ralod pramukh ajit singh ke saath baithak kii thi
 Taking this effort forward, Hazare and his fellow workers Arvind Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi and Manish Sisodia first met Bihar Chief Minister and senior JD-U leader Nitish
 kareeb 40 minute chali is mulaakaat ke baad nitish ne sanket diye ki vah hazaare paksh ke sujhaavon ke aadhaar par apane rajya main lokayukta kaa gathan karnaa chaahate hai
 Nitish said, 'we have not yet done a detailed study of the draft Hazare side
 masaude par gaur karne, apni party (jad-you) ke bheetar charchaa karne or sahyogi dalon ke saath baatcheet karne ke baad hi ham lokapal ke mudde par apana rukh tay karenge
 On the other hand, despite differences between the Congress and members of the society on the issue of the proposed Lokpal Bill, there are indications of a meeting between Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Hazare soon
 guuruuvaar ko donon ke bich mulaakaat nahin hone ke baad congress ke ek varisht netaa ne apana naam jaahir nahin karne kii shart par bataaya ki baithak jald hi ho sakati he
 He said, "despite differences on issues, the Congress President has always dealt with everyone with proper courtesy
 ’hazaare paksh kii aaj subah bhaajapa ke varisht netaa adwani, sushamaa, jetali or gadakari ke saath bhi mulaakaat honi he
 Meanwhile, regarding bjp's all-party meeting, Prasad said, "the issue of all-party meeting will be discussed only in the NDA meeting on July 2
 lihaaja yah nahin samajha janaa chaiye ki bhaajapa sarvadaleey baithak main shaamil nahin hone kaa man bana chuki he’ Gautam Bambawale Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping recently held an informal summit in Chennai
 pichley saal china ke vuhaan main hui pehali shikhar baithak kii hi tarah isamen bhi donon shakhsiyaton kii khubasurat tasveeron ke kai shandaar maukey aae
 Those who believe in the ground reality can question what the concrete results of 'chennai Connect' were and what they achieved
 iske liye paanch baton kii ore sidhe taur par ingit kiya ja saktaa he
 First, the two leaders discussed in detail the national hypotheses of their respective countries and the goals, including how to achieve them
 yah samrik samvaad saamne vaale paksh kii gananaa, ranneeti, taur-tareeke or soch kaa akalan karne ke liye mahatvapurn he
 Through this type of dialogue, India and China can develop understanding and trust towards each other
 yah mamallpuram baithak kaa sabase ahm hissaa tha
 Secondly, on the basis of briefing of the Indian side in front of the media, it was also clear that the two leaders have agreed to ensure that the border areas remain peaceful
 pichhali vuhaan baithak ke is nishkarsh ko aage badhaayaa jayega, jisase yah sanket mil rahaa he ki donon paksh seemaa ke kshetra main shanti sunishchit karne ko tatpar hai
 It has positive aspects for both sides
 sainya aadan-pradaan bhi badhaayaa jayega kyonki vah shanti kii ek purvashart sareekha he
 Third, a new 'high-level' system for trade, investment and services has been established which will be headed by the Deputy Prime Minister of China and our Finance Minister
 isse sanket miltaa he ki china ke saath bharat ke vyapaar ghate ko kam karne ke liye netaa tatpar hai
 This can happen only if we sell more services to China or we attract large amount of foreign investment from there
 isliye ise 'nai vyavastha' kaha ja rahaa he
 Skeptics may say that this will shift the issue of trade deficit back and forth, but we will also have to take some steps to attract investment from China so that the capital account helps us to maintain our balance of payments
 is lihaaj se hamaare vitt mantralay kii bhoomika ahm rahegi
 Fourthly, Modi and Xi have acknowledged that the common people of India and China will have to meet with each other more warmly in order to build a better relationship and build trust
 yah bhi vuhaan main kiye gaye kaam ko hi aage badhaane vaali baat he
 India has indicated that it will work hard to bring more Chinese tourists to India
 yah aasaani se ho bhi saktaa he agar ham china main 'atuly bharat' ko bechney ke liye ek nirantar, suspasht or lakshith abhiyaan chheden
 With the result of such a campaign we can surprise ourselves and the number of Chinese tourists coming to India in the next few years
 5 lakh ke maujuuda str se kaaphi badhaakar aasaani se 15 lakh tak le ja sakate hai
 Similarly, by offering a value-added offering based on intuitive knowledge to Chinese students, we can attract them to study in India in large numbers
 bharat-china ke logon ke bich aadan-pradaan ko badhaane ke sarkaron ke prayaason ko donon deshon ke nijee kshetron se bhi thodi majbootee milane kii jarurat he
 Ultimately, this summit has become an important part of an international diplomatic trend
 khaas taur par, jab deshon ke bich rishte jatil hon to is tarah kii mulaakaaten netritv ko li se hatakar kuch sochane kaa mauka detii hai taaki ve hameshaa puraani baton se bandhakar hi na rah jaaen
 In our context, it is important that the two leaders take responsibility for the relationship
 yah hamaare rishton ke liye acchhee baat he
 People with negative thinking will be forced to ask the question whether there was any help in resolving any of the important issues that upset the india-china relationship in Chennai? The answer is no
 vaise agar aap khud se yah sawaal karen ki kya mamallpuram se rishton ko ek santulan kaa bhav dene main kya koi madad mili he or usamen aage badaae kaa bhav he, to jawaab spasht haa main hi hoga

 Former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has been associated with controversies
 unhone siem ke 9 maheenon ke chote se kaarykaal main kai vivaadon ko janm diya
 Every time they spoke, a new controversy arose
 unke kaarykaal ke kuch vivaadit bayanon ko ham pesh kar rahe hai
 Jitan Ram Manjhi, who resigned as the Chief Minister of Bihar, took over the state power on May 20, 2014
 satta sanbhaalane ke baad unke bare main kaha gaya tha ki rajya ko pehali baar aisa mukhyamantri mila he, jo samaaj ke sabase nichle tabake ke samudaay kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, lekin 9 maheenon ke mukhyamantri kaarykaal main maanjhi na keval apane bayanon ko lekar vivaadon main rahe, balki party ke faisle nahin maanane ke kaaran unhen dal se nishkasit hona padaa
 Manjhi Sarkar made many important decisions during his tenure, but due to conflicting statements, he remained much discussed
 raajnneeti main 'soshal ejineering' main maahir samajhe jane vaale nitish kumaar ne loksabhaa chunaav main party kii karaari haar ke baad bihar kemukhyamantripad se istipha dekar mahadalit parivaar se aae jeethanram maanjhi ko mukhyamantri bana to diya, lekin unke bayanon ne party ko mushkil main bhi daal diya
 Manjhi's disputed statement- Manjhi, while addressing a group of officials on August 13 last year, said, 'I have no hesitation in accepting that there is corruption in government machinery from top to bottom
 kuch saal pehle bijli bill main sanshodhan karwaane ke liye mere parivaar ko rishwat deni padi thi
 In a program organized in his home district Gaya, while denying Nitish's claim of 'zero Tolerance Policy' against corruption, Manjhi had said that there may have been development in the Nitish government, but corruption has not reduced even then
 - bihar main baadh prabhavit logon ke chuha khaakar jinda rahane kii khabar par mukhyamantri maanjhi ne ajeebogareeb bayaan ne raajnneeti main halchal laa di thi
 He said that eating a rat is not a bad thing
 vah bhi chuha khate the
 Actually, Manjhi belongs to the Musahar caste, which is still a socially, economically and educationally backward caste
 - maanjhi ne daliton or pichhadi jatiyon ke yuvakon ko antarjaateey vivaah karne kii naseehat di thi
 After all these statements, the party leaders had to come forward to give clarification
 - maanjhi ne bihar se taalluk rakhane vaale kendriya mantriyon ko rajya main nahin ghusane dene kii chetavanee dete hue kaha tha, 'agar ye saatbhaiya rajya ke vikaas main madad nahin karte hai, to unhen bihar main ghusane nahin denge
 They all stay in Delhi
 '- 17 oktober, 2014 komanjhine motihaari main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue doctoron ke haath kaat dene kii chetavanee de di thi
 Talking to journalists in Patna, on October 13 last year, he advised to increase the age of marriage to 25 years to overcome good health and child malnutrition
 iske alaava bhi maanjhi kai maukon par vivaadit bayanon ke kaaran apni hi party ke netaaon or vipakshiyon kaa nishaanaa ban chuke hai
 Input IANS karnataka main apni satta vaapasi se utsahitcongreshimachal pradesh jaise chote rajya main bhi majbootee se vyavasthit hone lagi he
 Apart from old and old leaders, the Congress has started preparing for the Lok Sabha elections through the 'young Team'
 party ne susheel kumaar scindia ko hataakar eisisi prabharee rajani patil ko rajya kaa prabharee bana diya he
 Rajni Patil will support Rahul Gandhi in the proposed political plan of the state
 himachal main vidhansabha chunaav main dhul chaatane ke baad congress aakraamak hona chaahati he
 Sources reveal that the party wants to change face in at least half of the state's four Lok Sabha seats
 mandi sansadeey seat se pratyaashee rahe virbhadra singh ke rajasi parivaar ke is baar maidan main nayaa ummidavaar dene kii taiyaari he vahiin shimla sansadeey seat se aarakshan ke kaaran ummidavaar badla janaa tay he
 It is proposed to give tickets to Rajendra Rana or someone from his family from Hamirpur, the seat where former Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal's son and former BCCI president Anurag Thakur is MP
 kangra se bhaajapa saansad shanta kumaar ne pehle hi chunaav na ladane kaa faisla le liya he
 In such a situation, looking at the new BJP candidate, the Congress can also bet on a young face

 Your partner is very optimistic and he also takes care of your freedom

 ab jaraa unke haathon ko dekhen
 Are they on the chest agar haa, to mohatarama aapkaa saathi kisi raja se kam nahin he
 At the bed he will not miss out on satisfying you completely
 har tarah se sambandhon kaa puraa anand uthaane vaale aapke saathi aapako santusht kiye bina nahin rukenge
 Sleeping on the side, men who sleep on the other side, they carry people with them
 meljol kaa bhav rakhane vaale yah purush aapaki bhaawanaaon kii khub kadra karenge
 Yes, he can be very emotional at bed, so stand by him not to hurt his feelings
 fail kar sonsiogar vah puure bistar par fail kar sote hai, to bhi aapke liye acha hi he
 Because he will not take any time to compromise
 is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki bistar par aapke saath vah apni sari pareshaaniyaan bhul janaa chaahate hai
 Therefore, never talk about things that increase their problems during the relationship

 Heavy Industries Minister Praful Patel sent a letter to Defense Minister AK Antony and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressing displeasure as to why government undertakings, ie psus, were excluded from the tender process of the aircraft
 airforce de par jab vayusena aasmaan main apni takat kii numaaish kar rahi thi, rakshaamantri eke antni ko ek chitthee baar-baar pareshaan kar rahi thi
 This letter was written by Praful Patel, his associate in the Manmohan cabinet
 sakht shabdon main bheji is chitthee main prafull patel ne transport air craft kii kharid main sarkari companiyon ko boli lagane se rokane par sawaal uthaae hai
 Praful Patel has written in the letter, there are many government undertakings which fulfill the conditions fixed for joining this tender
 lekin unhen isliye mauka nahin diya gaya, kyonki wo sarkari upkram hai
 Government undertakings should get equal opportunity
 isse swasth pratiyogita ko badhaava milegaa
 Significantly, Praful Patel also sees the magic of a government undertaking
 eke antni us dephence ekvijishan council ke mukhiya the, jisane bhartiya vayusena main aircraft kii boli se piesu ko baahar rakhane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Let me tell you that the Air Force is going to buy new transport air craft in place of its old 56 aero transport aircraft for about 12000 crores
 iske liye 9 may ko jo tender jari kiya gaya, usamen hindustan aronutics limited jaise sarkari upakramon kii andekhi kar di gai
 The Air Force says the new aircrafts will be sourced from an Indian private sector firm
 iske liye vayusena ne aath videshi companiyon ko tender jari kiya he
 According to the conditions, these companies will partner with an Indian company and provide aircraft to the Air Force
 40 aircraft bharat main nirmit honge
 The question arises why private and foreign companies are being preferred, when the government companies themselves are competent? However, questions have often been raised about the defense deal

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne aaj jab press se mukhaatib hue to apane pradarshan ko aankane kaa jimmaa itihaas par chhod diya or kaha ki agar narendra modi desh ke piem bane to yah vinaashkari hoga
 The Prime Minister responded to these things by a senior BJP leader and Leader of the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley
 unhone piem ke itihaaskaar vaale bayaan kaa jamkar makhul udaaya or upie-2 ko har morche par vifal bataate hue arun jetali ne kaha ki berogari, mahangaai or bhrashtachar ke paimaane le liye jaaen to yah sarkaar to puri tarah se vifal rahi
 Arun Jaitley said this
 
 
 unke ritairement ke elaan ke alaava baaki press conference ek aupchaarikta thi
 If we talk about the real intent of what he said, then the Prime Minister has accepted that his government failed on the issue of corruption
 unhone sweekaar kiya ki upie2 rojgaar nahin de pai
 He admitted that the government failed on the issue of inflation
 ab kisi bhi shashan ke ye teen paimaane le liye jaaen, jisamen berogari, mahangaai or bhrashtachar he, to sarkaar to puri tarah se vifal rahi
 This is a sign of destruction
 lekin phir bhi unhone acha shashan diya, iske liye vah tark dhundhate rahe
 The most bizarre argument was that when asked if your government could not succeed in the corruption case or what was the step that you should have taken
 magar nahin liya
 So really they should have introspected
 kol block yaa 2ji aavanton ke samay log unako baar-baar kah rahe the ki karpshan ho rahaa he, to vah roak sakate the
 But they did not care
 unhone aaj ek nae tark kaa nirmaan kiya
 And the new argument was that corruption happened in UPA 1 and then won the 2009 election
 to sarkaar chunavi sweekruti ko apane bhrashtachar se bari hone kaa aadhaar banaaya ja rahaa he
 What was the most used sentence of this press conference today
 itihaaskaar tay karenge ki maine kaisaa kaam kiya
 And the second sentence was that time will tell
 ab loktantr main in tarkon ke kya myne hai
 The 2009 election result freed him from corruption charges and the election results that went against him now, do they not confirm his government's failure
 aaj pradhanmantri media or vipaksh se bahut kadavaahat paale dikh rahe the
 In that too, he was very angry with Narendra Modi
 ab agar unheen kaa tark le liya jaae ki 2009 ke chunaav parinaam se 2ji or koyala kaa karpshan mit gaya, to isi tark se modi ji bhi chunaav jeetne ke baad dosha mukt ho jate the
 But for this reason, Modi did not call himself guilty
 1947 se aaj tak is desh kaa doosraa koi raajnneetik netaa nahin he, jise itani scrootni se nikalnaa pad rahaa ho
 He has turned out to be impeccable even in the investigation conducted under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 or dangon kii baat chali he to dhyaan rahe ki jab manmohan singh dilli se chunaav lade the, jo vah haar gaye the, usamen unhone prachaar ke dauraan kaha tha ki aresas ne 1984 ke dange karwaae the
 This was pm's Farewell press conference
 is dauraan unhone apane pad kii garima ke khilaaf kai bayaan die
 The honesty with which they should have introspected

 is tarah kii sanak ne bharatiyon kaa peechha karnaa shuru kar diya he
 It is not right to sit here and imagine how exaggerated or terrorized by such incidents or how relaxed they are after President Trump's assurance
 magar baat honi chahie, agar aapkaa man upi kii nautankiyon se nahin bharaa he to is par baat kar sakate hai ki jin bacchon ke ejeeniyar banane main aapane lakhon kharch kiye, unke sapane par 'meraa desh meri naukari' tip kii kunthit raajnneeti kaa asar padaa to kya hoga
 You have done such a state of media or the media has done it for you, only you can tell better on this
 media kii aisi koi sachai ab aapse nahin chuphi he, agar aap bharat ke loktantr ke liye isi tarah kaa media behatar samajhate hai to jarur aapane kuch gambhirtha se sochaa hi hoga
 Because you are sensible, aware, i have never been suspicious about this

 It is now said that with this visa, Indian engineers work on less money, American engineers get less opportunity
 ab yahaan ek sawaal apane penlist se puuchhuunga ki kya america bharat ke jitna yaa bharat ke jaisaa ejeeniyar paidaa karata he
 It is not that India did not try

 jab aapaki beti yaa bete kaa phone aata he ki agle maheene america janaa he to kaisaa lagata he
 You must think that you have got a big chance, your children are moving closer to bigger possibilities
 jab aapako pataa chale ki vahaan kii sarkaar aisi niti bana rahi he jisase uske vahaan jane kii sambhaavna pehle se kam ho jaae to kaisaa lagegaa
 Big companies like Wipro, HCL Technology, Tata Consultancy Services send software engineers every month
 ab kaha jaataa he ki is visa ke sahare bhartiya ejeeniyar kam paise par kaam karte hai, amareeki ejiniyaron ko kam mauka miltaa he
 Now here i will ask a question to my panelist whether America produces engineers as much as India or like India
 aisa nahin he ki bharat ne prayaas nahin kiya
 According to media reports, Indian officials continued to explain their views with the US administration, but they also hoped that by imposing a six-month moratorium on the visa, the US is indicating that it will follow its policy
 bharat kii kul jidipi kaa 9 pratishat iti sector se aata he
 This business plays an important role in the india-us relationship
 infosis jaisi company kaa aadha rajasav america se milane vaale bijness par nirbhar karata he
 This is where a question arises whether there is a bigger market for Indian software companies other than the US
 is vakt unako kis desh ke software ejiniyaron se chunauti mil rahi he or iskaa bharat main ejineering kii padhai pard rahe lakhon chaatro par kya asar padegaa
 The Republican Senator has introduced a bill that whoever comes to America from outside, should be given a salary of at least one million dollars
 yani selary itani zyaada ho ki companiyaan majaboor ho jaaen ki ve saste bhartiya ejiniyaron kii jagah amareeki ejiniyaron ko mauka den
 a bill has also been introduced to stop Indian engineers in the US or to stop external engineers so that companies give more priority to American engineers
 america ke shram vibhaag ne software company orekal par mukadmaa bhi kiya he ki company ne shwet, hispanik, africa amareeki logon ko kam naukariyaan di hai or asian, khaskar bharatiyon ko zyaada praathamikta di he
 What will happen to Indian engineers when Indian companies start hiring Americans
 yah bhi ek sawaal he
 Companies will continue to thrive, but where will the vehicles of young people who are in colleges hoping to get jobs in them get stuck
 kya bhartiya software companiyon ne is tarah kaa bhartee abhiyaan shuru kar diya he ki bharatiyon kii jagah ab amareeki logon ko rakhaa jaae
 After all, why did the US administration not hear India's favor even after the efforts of the Foreign Secretary and his team
 kai log kah rahe hai ki tatkaal seva tip vaali visa par chah maheene kii roak asthaayee he
 Old deficiencies are being corrected
 magar america ne apni taraf se aisa kuch nahin kaha he
 So what should engineers do other than Indian companies
 kya unhen is tarah kii maansikta ke khilaaf awaz nahin uthaani chahie
 If the engineers support such things in their country, then where will they protest about America
 unka saath koun degaa
 But not everyone in the world is silent isi 16 farvari ko america bhar ke imigrantus ne apane aapako ek din ke liye kaam se dur rakhaa
 The name of this protest was "A Day Without Immigrants
 " trump sarkaar kii niti kaa virodh karne ke liye bahari mulkon se aae logon ne apni ek din kii selary or mazaduri chhod di
 The purpose of this demonstration was to tell the people of America what it means for them not to come to work one day
 unki sevaaon par kya asar padegaa
 In support of this, many hotel restaurants in America also put up posters
 naaraa diya ki imigrents ne america ko mahaan banaaya he
 They make America great
 ve aapkaa khaanaa banaate hai
 Do your work media report ke anusaar is pradarshan main shaamil hone ke kaaran kuch logon kii naukariyaan bhi chali gayi
 So this mentality has entered companies
 'desh se baahar jaao' kii raajnneeti kaa vahi sur he jo aapke bharat main baat baat main pakistan bhej dene kii raajnneeti ke shor main sunai detaa rahata he
 Would Indian software companies not give anything to America for their business? aisa to ho nahin saktaa ki bhartiya software companiyon ke bijness se america ko koi laabh nahin he
 There is no benefit from the students who went to the engineering colleges there to take loans from here
 tathy kya he
 Fact also has a role
 jab yaheen nahin hoti to vahaan ham kaise ummid kar sakate hai phir bhi yah jaananaa zaruri he ki amareeki arthvyavastha ko bhartiya companiyaan kya detii hai
 9 percent of India's total GDP comes from the IT sector
 bharat-america ke rishte ke bich yah bijness mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Half the revenue of a company like Infosys depends on the business from the USA
 yaheen par ek sawaal banataa he ki kya bhartiya software companiyon ke liye america ke alaava koi or bada bazaar he

 The girl, who was a victim of cruelty at the age of playing, was pouring water from a water tanker in the street to help her mother that day
 tabhi use ek shaks mila or use chaaumin khilaane kii baat kahi
 How did Uncle accused of rape know that the girl loves Choumin
 pehle to bacchee ne manaa kiya, lekin jab ankal ne promis kiya ki wo chaaumin khilaa kar use waapas uske ghar chhod denge, to maasoom ne un par bharosa kar liya or unke saath chali gai
 They bought 10 rupees cachamin from a nearby shop and fed it to the girl
 iske baad jab maasoom ne ghar jane kii baat kahi to ankal ne bahaanaa karnaa shuru kar diya
 They cut her with a blade while she was crying
 bahut rone par bhi darinde ankal ne use nahin choda or bacchee kaa munh dabaa diya
 Then the child does not know what else happened to her
 maasoom nahin jaanati ki vah so gai thi yaa phir behosh ho gai thi
 Later, an aunt living in his neighborhood saw him in the bushes and they were the ones who informed his family
 bataate hai ki wo antee bhi bacchee kii haalat dekh kar dar gai
 When the innocent father of 4 years saw him in this condition, he was also scared and could not even recognize the father
 ab itane saal baad ek baar phir ismasoom ke bahaane log nirbhayaor gudiya didi kii baaten karne lage hai

 Some people go out to burn candles and candles again
 lekin shaayad ab nirbhaya or gudiya didi ke saath hue haadase ko bahut din guzar chuke hai
 Like a case like Kyanirbhaya and Gudiya Didi, burning candles for this girl will heal the wounds of the girl? Will no dirty uncle ever do this to a child again? ek baar phir sabit ho gaya ki worldcup vijeta banane ke liye jin-jin khoobiyon kii jarurat hoti he wo australia main kuta-kuta kar bhari hui hai

 Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid ownership dispute in Ayodhya will be heard in Supreme Court today
 is bich is vivaad main ek teesraa paksh bhi khadaa ho gaya he
 Some people in the Buddhist community have claimed that this disputed land belongs to Buddhists and was previously a Buddhist site
 times of india kii khabar ke anusaar, ayodhya main rahane vaale vineet kumaar maury ne supreme court main is bare main yachika daayar kii he
 He has made this claim on the basis of four excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) at the disputed site
 elahabaad hoicourt kii lakhanu bench ke aadesh par aisi antim khudaai saal 2002-03 main hui thi
 This petition has been filed in the Supreme Court only last week

 The petition is said to have been filed on behalf of 'members of the Buddhist community who are living a life based on the principles of Lord Buddha
 'ayodhya main buddha vihaar hone kaa daavayachika main daawa kiya gaya he kibabari masjidke nirmaan se pehle us jagah par buddha dharm se judaa dhaancha tha
 Maurya has said in his petition, "the ASI excavations showed that there were stupas, circular stupas, walls and pillars which are characteristic of a Buddhist vihara
 ' maury ne daawa kiya he, 'jin 50 gaddhon kii khudaai hui he, vahaan kisi bhi mandir yaa hindu dhaanche ke avshesh nahin mili hai
 In this petition, he has demanded from the Supreme Court that the disputed site be declared a Buddhist vihara like Shravasti, Kapilavastu, Kushinagar and Sarnath
 nehru kaa naam lenaa in dinon khatare se khaali nahin he
 Any nationalist can hold your collar and serve in front of you incomplete and half-baked information that has been fabricated and carried forward in the name of Nehru
 tathakthith rashtravaadiyon ne nehru or gandhi ko lagbhag khalnaayakon main badalane kii koshish kii he
 There is no limit to the propaganda against them
 itihaas or deshkal kii vastunishth samaj na rakhane vaale log is dushprachaar se prabhavit bhi dikhte hai- vah nai peedi kuch zyaada hi, jiske liye in dinon padhai-likhaai desh-duniya ko samajhane kaa nahin, bas paise vaali naukari paa lene kaa jariya bana di gai he
 Piyush Babelle's book 'nehru Myth and Truth' came in this environment is nothing short of a pleasant surprise
 piyush ne tay kiya ki vah nehru ke bare main banaai ja rahi dharanaon kaa tathyon ke aaine main pareekshan karenge
 He made a detailed study of Nehru's speeches from the Red Fort, his dialogues with other leaders during the freedom struggle, his letters and documents of the time, and found that Nehru was someone else with this real reference material
 lekin yah kitaab nehru ke bare main banaae gaye bhramon ke nivaaran main hi aapaki madad nahin karti, vah aapako bataati he ki kis tarah swatantraaa sangram ke un tamaam varshon main isse jude netaaon ke bich vaicharik sangram bhi lagaataar chal rahe the, ki jis mitti ne azaad bharat ko gadha, use kitne kade pareekshanon se guzaar kar chaak par chadhaaya gaya tha
 Perhaps this is the strength of the soil that despite all the propaganda and efforts, there is an innate respect for the pluralistic culture in the Indian nation state, and the forces dreaming of the so-called Hindu Rashtra are also forced to bow down to this pluralism
 yah kitaab kai lihaaj se mahatvapurn he
 One tells how our constitution makers talked about the fake debates that are going on right now and find answers that should not leave any confusion in the coming days
 bhram agar iske baavjood he yaa paidaa kiya gaya to isliye ki hamane vah sari bahasein bhula deen, ve sawaal-jawaab dekhne tak kii jahamat mol nahin lee jo is desh ke netaa aapas main karte rahe or vah buniyaad gadhate rahe jis par yah desh tikaa hua he
 This book reminds you of many missed debates amidst this terrible amnesia
 vah bataati he ki bharat mata kii jai kehane kaa maamla ho yaa tirange ke sammaan kaa yaa khaadi kii aavashyaktaa kaa- kai tarah ke takaraavon se bhare us daur main bhi ye masale alakshith nahin rahe the
 Particularly in the midst of communal divide, the biggest challenge was to create an India that is free from the pressures of majoritarianism and also gives equal status and status to its minority communities
 yah kitaab padhate hue is baat kaa bhi khyal aata he ki darasal nehru ke saath anyaay sirf unhone nahin kiya he jo nehru ko lekar dushprachaar karte rahe hai, unhone bhi kiya he jo multah nehru ke mureed hai lekin yah dekhne main naakaam rahe hai ki nehru ne kitne-kitne prasangon par kitni baariki se vichaar kiya he
 It is often said that Nehru was quite different from Gandhi and that he did not follow Gandhi's path
 lekin yah algaav na gandhi se chupa tha na nehru se, or donon ne is algaav par bahut sanjidagi se baat kii thi
 This conversation also shows how openly two people belonging to the same movement, the same struggle, the same dream, disagree with each other and also consider it important that their disagreements are not hidden, let the whole world know
 
 gandhi kehete hai- ‘agar ham donon ke nazariye main koi buniyadi fark he to desh ko is bare main puri jaankaree honi chahie
 If we see people in the dark then it will be fatal in the work of Swaraj
 “ iske baad gandhi swaraj kii apni kalpana bataate hue kehete hai bharat ko gaanvon or jhopadon main rahanaa hoga kyonki shaharon or mehalon main karodon log kabhi khushhaali se nahin rah sakate
 Do not listen to Nehru Gandhi silently
 ve palat kar jawaab dete hen- ‘karodon logon ke liye mehalon kaa sawaal to nahin uthta, lekin meri samaj main yah baat nahin aati ki karodon logon ke paas aise suvidhajanak ghar kyon nahin hone chahie jinamein ve susanskrit dhang se rah saken
 Gandhi has earlier cited 'hind Swaraj'
 nehru do took kehete hai ki pehle bhi yah kitaab unhen sachai se dur lagi thi or ab yah duuri or badi hui lagati he
 This conversation is taking place in 1945
 ham pate hai ki gandhi apane rukh se kuch waapas lautate hai or un kuch nunatam binduon ko rekhaankit karte hai jin par donon sahamat hai or maanate hai ki donon main buniyadi asahmatiyaan nahin hai
 It is often reiterated that Gandhi wanted to end the Congress
 azaadi ke baad ve chaahate the ki koi nayaa sanghathan bane
 But few people remember that Nehru also strongly criticized the Congress
 4 june 1949 ko mukhyamantriyon ke ek sammelan main unhone kaha tha- ‘congress ke log sust ho gaye hai
 In a rapidly changing world, there is nothing more dangerous than having a mind rooted and living in a mogul
 ' ve vistaar main is baat kii charchaa karte hai ki kaise congress ne apane mul lakshya kho die hai or un muddon main uljhi hui he jo apraasangik hai
 Nehru knows his responsibilities well
 yah ehsaas bhi he ki vibhaajan ke baad visthapit logon ko basaane kii jo viraat chunauti saamne aa gai he, usne kai buniyadi or zaruri sawaalon ko sthagit kar diya he
 Their entire energy is being consumed right there
 roti, kapade or ghar jaise buniyadi sawaal hal hone baaqi hai
 In fact, this entire book breaks many illusions about Nehru and brings out many aspects of his personality
 ek nehru ve hai jo swadhinata sangram ke dauraan jail katate hue desh or duniya ke sawaalon par bilkul aadhunik dhang se vichaar kar rahe hai, ek nehru ve hai jo bhartiya sabhyataa or samskruti kii viraat kavita main parampara or aadhuniktaa ke alag-alag tatwon kii shinaakht kar rahe hai, ek nehru ve hai jo azaadi ke baad pehle pradhanmantri ke taur par desh ke nirmaan ke yajna main lage hue hai or yah jaanate-maanate hai ki unhen har kisi kii javabdehi leni he, swatantraaa ko samanta or samruddhi ke saath jodakar arthvaan bananaa he or bhartiya ekta or akhandta ko bhartiya antaratma kaa buniyadi mulya bananaa he na ki koi thopi hui vyavastha
 a Nehru is the one who is cross-examining his Guru Gandhi and contemporaries - Patel, Jinnah and Subhash Chandra Bose, and yet does not allow personal respect for them to come down and a Nehru is the one who is able to build different kinds of institutions
 Are engaged in kitaab kii ek kubi fih he ki lekhak isamen apni ore se nahin ke baraabar bolta he
 Throughout the book, either Nehru speaks or his contemporary
 lekhak bas kisi sutaradhar kii tarah jahaan zaruri ho, vahaan kuch prasangon kii vyakhya kar detaa he or kahin ekaadh sandarbh juta detaa he
 Avoiding the temptation to give and fill additional knowledge in your book is also a kind of quality that is found in lesser writers
 is kitaab ko padhanaa darasal nehru ko jaananaa bhar nahin he, kai zaruri prashnon par apni ek taarkik raay bananaa bhi he
 There is a lot of material on Nehru in English, there are books explaining that material, but in Hindi it is probably the first book that puts Nehru before us with this totality and neutrality
 durbhaagya se yah bhartiya loktantr main khaae-pie-aghaae rashtrawaad kaa swarnakaal he
 This nationalism is going shoulder to shoulder with the post-colonial projects that are creating a new economic and intellectual slavery in India
 is kaam main uski madad vah hataash maansikta bhi kar rahi he jiske paas na qaayade kaa rojgaar he or na jivan, lekin jise dharm or raashtra ke chhadam abhimaan kii aisi ghutti pilaa di gai he ki vah is rashtrawaad kaa sabase kattar sipaahi bana hua he
 Needless to say that this entire mindset has been given the most fertilizer and water by the RSS which knows that this concept of free and pluralistic India will not be possible without Gandhi and Nehru being villains
 lekin gandhi or nehru kii viraasat bahut badi he- itani badi ki vah is dushprachaar ke daayre main nahin samaati
 a writer like Piyush Babelle goes close to Nehru one day and finds that this Nehru is actually a man scattered in the fields and rivers of India without which this country cannot be imagined
 is samiksha par- is kitaab kii tarah hi- shaayad nehru ke prati mohagrast hone ke aarope lag sakate hai, lekin yah sach he ki nehru kaa moh itnaa prabal isliye bhi he ki apni kai vifaltaaon ke baavjood nehru ne bharat naam ke raashtra rajya ko ek aisi udaatt or maanviya shakl di, jisaki ore duniya dekh sake- vah bhi ek aise samay main, jab sampradayikta kaa unmaad apane charam par tha or kisi kaa dimaag karaab karne ke liye paryaapt tha
 Nehru Myth and Truth: Piyush Babelle; Dialogue Publication, 300 rupees; 430 pages somnath bharti kii apil he ki media unki patni ke saath unke nijee maamle ko tool na de
 But is domestic harassment of a woman a personal matter? In fact, domestic harassment law was enacted only because it created an understanding that the violence that is happening on women in the private world of the house courtyard is a social evil and crime
 vaise raajnneetik dhang se bhi dekhen to chaahe somnath bharti kaa maamla ho yaa phir jitendra tomars kaa, donon unki nijee naakaamiyaan nahin, aam aadmi party kii samuhik vifaltaa bhi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party, which has created a criterion for all, has failed miserably in its introspection
 aakhir yahi somnath bharti the jinhone khidki ekstansion main nigeria kii ashwet mahilaon ke ghar ke baahar bheed ikattha kii, unka saarvajanik apmaan kiya or puri aam aadmi party unke krity ke bachaav main na sirf khadi rahi, balki rail bhawan ke saamne andolan par baith gai
 The comments aam aadmi party shuchita kii baat bahut karti he lekin bhul jaati he ki bharat main shuchita kaa jo sabase bada pairokaar tha, vah gandhi nijee aacharan ko lekar bahut kathor tha
 He used to choose his agitators very strongly, he could withdraw the agitation for three years on a massacre
 kejariwal kii party kuch bhi waapas lene ko taiyaar nahin dikhti
 In the case of Jitendra Tomar, he showed shamelessness and in the case of Somnath Bharti too obstinacy
 khatra yah he ki aam aadmi party ke bheetar aise khataron ke khilaadi or bhi hai, jinke karname aane vaale dinon main bharat ke saarvajanik vyavhaar main haas-parihaas se lekar ninda tak kaa saamaan ban sakate hai
 By the way, even if it is a matter of Somnath Bharti or Jitendra Tomar, both are not their personal failures, but also the collective failure of the Aam Aadmi Party
 sabake liye kasuti banane vaali aam aadmi party apane aatmapareekshan main buree tarah naakaam rahi he
 After all, it was Somnath Bharti who gathered crowds outside the home of black women of Nigeria in the window extension, publicly insulted them and the entire Aam Aadmi Party not only stood in defense of their act, but sat on the agitation in front of Rail Bhavan
 tippaniyan The Aam Aadmi Party talks a lot about purity but forgets that Gandhi was the biggest advocate of purity in India, Gandhi was very strict about personal conduct
 vah apane andolankaaree badi sakhti se chunata tha, vah ek hatyakand par teen saal se chal rahaa andolan waapas le saktaa tha
 Kejriwal's party seems unwilling to take anything back
 jitendra tomars ke maamle main bhi unhone besharmi dikhaai or somnath bharti ke maamle main bhi adiyalapan
 The danger is that within the Aam Aadmi Party, there are other players of such threats, whose exploits in the coming days can become the stuff of public public behavior from ridicule to condemnation

 Kasab claimed that he is a minor, but the court rejected his plea based on scientific evidence
 25 farvari, 2008 ko daayar 11,000 prishthon ke aaropapatr main uski umr 21 varsh bataai gai
 Three lawyers fought the case on Kasab's behalf
 sabase pehle niyukt hui vakil anjali vaaghmare ko mukadmaa shuru hone se pehle hi takneekee kaarnon se hataa diya gaya
 The court came to know that Anjali was representing another witness in the case
 anjali ke baad niyukt hue abbaas kazmi ko adaalat ke saath sahyog na karne ke kaaran mukademe ke bich main hataa diya gaya
 Subsequently, KP Pawar, who represented Kasab till the end of the trial, said in his plea that his client Kasab was innocent and he was arrested by the police a few days before the attack

 It is not so either
 maine aage script ko develop karne ke liye kaaphi research kii film oil mafia par thi or research karte hue iske taar bharat se lekar australia tak faile hue mili
 Research work is always more challenging than making a film on a made-up story
 majaa bhi aata he
 Like Shootout at Lokhandwala, i did months of research like a journalist, ran around police stations, interviewed policemen and police officers and big police officers

 It is also not decided that i will never marry
 agar kabhi kii bhi to uski vajah sirf bachche honge
 Because the child needs both mother and father in the family

 What do i do when i am not making films? i am lying in bed with my dogs at home all day

 Our audience has also matured
 hameshaa se film mekar hi bananaa chaahate the?haa, filmon ke prati divaanaapan to skool ke dinon se hi tha
 i used to watch a lot of films
 zanjeer bhi tabhi dekhi thi
 But the road to reach here has been very difficult
 aap kahin bhi jaaie, sangharsh to hota hi he
 But the film world can make you sit on the sky by lifting it from the ground in one stroke and in another shock, it can also drop from the sky to the ground

 Madan, a resident of Kudia Garhi village in Ghaziabad district, is wandering from employment to employment
 unke chaaron ladke berojgaar hai or maheenon se kaam kii talash kar rahe hai
 In a conversation with NDTV, he says that the cost of running a family is increasing and earning is decreasing
 madan ji kehete hai, 'mahatma gandhi rojgaar yojana ke tahat kuch samay pehle kaam mila tha
 It took 20 days of work to dig a pond
 phir achaanak barsaat ke mausam main kaam roak diya gaya
 Nearly two thousand rupees was found, but after this, no work was found for the last several months
 ' According to Madan, some work is being done under the MGNREGA scheme in the nearby villages, but not at all in his village
 unki patni kahati hai, 'kuch din pehle sthaneey adhikari paas ke gaanv main aaye the job card banane ke liye
 
 
 But i came to know about this late so could not get the job card made
 hamen kaam chahie jo hamen nahin mil paa rahaa he
 When NDTV visited Kudia Garhi village, it was revealed that Madan is not the only one who is forced to wander in search of work
 is gaanv main hamen aise kai log mili jinako manaregaa tahat kaam maangane se bhi nahin mila
 Dharam Singh says that he asked for work but did not get it

 a person close to him got work but got only half the money for work
 sabase chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki ghaziabad zile kaa kudiya gadhi gaanv dilli-upi border se sirf 25 kilometre dur he
 But despite being so close to the capital, NDTV found many people in this village who do not even know about it nine years after the launch of the scheme
 darasal manaregaa yojana kii khasta haalat is gaanv tak hi simit nahin he
 According to government figures, as of January this year, an average of 34 in the country under the MNREGA
 84 din prati parivaar rojgaar mila he jo ab tak sabase kam he
 Last year it was an average of 46 days per family
 samay-samay par kai rajya manaregaa yojana ke liye funds kii kami kii shikaayat bhi karte rahe hai jisaki vajah se zaruuraratmandon ko kaam kam mil paa rahaa he or bhugtan main bhi deree ho rahi he
 The question is also about corruption
 pichley nau saal main desh ke alag-alag rajyon main bhrashtachar ke kai maamle saamne aa chuke hai
 The result of all this is that the existing administrative system for implementing MGNREGA on the ground has become very weak, due to which it is not able to reach the needy
 ghaziabad zile ke kudiya gadhi gaanv main rojgaar ke liye tarasate log inhen vajahon se manaregaa yojana kaa phayda nahin uthaa paa rahe hai

 Directed by Siddharth Anand, the film is quite buzzing at the box office
 film kaa trailor relies hone ke baad kuch vakt tak isko lekar negative vyuu point bana tha lekin phir film ke gane relies hone or pramotion shuru hone ke baad isko lekar rujhaan banane shuru ho gaye

 1
 ruthik roshan vs tiger shroff:bollywood ke aise 2 abhinayta jo apane ection or damdaar dance ke liye jane jate hai
 The two are being brought together on screen for the first time
 sirf ek saath parde par aane tak hi baat simit nahin he
 The thing is that both of them will get face off for the audience to see
 trailor se bhi ye baat saaf he ki film main jabardast ection dekhne ko milegaa
 So if you are fond of action films then you can go to theaters
 2
 Then Hrithik in a negative avatar: Hrithik Roshan was seen playing a negative role in Dhoom 2
 iske baad unhone kai tarah ke kirdaar kiye or ab lambey vakt baad vah ek baar phir se negative role main najar aaenge
 Once again, Hrithik will be in tremendous action mode and after the release of the trailer, it is also clear that his character will be of a patriot who later turns against the country

 How is the chemistry of Guru-disciple: Everyone knows that Tiger Shroff has considered Hrithik Roshan as his guru
 unhone ruthik ko hameshaa se hi apana idal mana he or vah unke saath kaam karnaa chaahate the
 He finally gets a chance to work with his Idol

 The review of the film is yet to come but one thing is clear from the trends that due to the tremendous stunts, epic locations and amazing shooting techniques, the film entertainment is definitely going to happen
 5
 Who will win? Hrithik and Tiger have their own fan base
 donon hi kamaal ke ection or dance hero hai or isiilie donon ke phans apane apane actors kaa saport kar rahe hai
 Now that both of them are army ready, then it will have to be seen who manages to win this war

 Then Tanu reaches there, Abhi leaves after seeing her
 duusari taraf party main jab media tanu se abhi ke nae album ke sambandh main sawaal puuchhati he to tanu kaa dhyaan photoshute par adhik hota he
 She says that she and Abhi are married five days later and will be happiest that day
 tabhi daadi vahaan aakar tanu ko tokati he ki abhi tanu se shaadi tabhi karegaa jab purab thik ho jayega, tab tak shaadi nahin hogi
 Pragya takes Dadi in the middle and says that she should not spoil her health by taking all this tension and she will take care of everything
 kuch der baad abhi party main aata he, vah man hi man pragna kii tarif karata he ki usne kaaphi acha arrangement kiya he
 On seeing her, the media surrounds her but Tanu takes her aside and tries to talk to her
 tabhi abhi pragna ko dekhakar uske paas chalaa jaataa he, vahaan thokar lagane se pragna gir jaati he jise abhi sambhalata he
 That's when the people of the music company reach there and they praise the party
 iske baad abhi or pragna ek duusare kii tarif karte hai
 Tanu is jealous after seeing them together and goes to Aaliya and complains that she should do something for it
 tabhi aalia use taana maarthi he ki uski vajah se purab kii yah haalat he or vah usase ummid karti he ki vah uski madad kare
 Alia tells Tanu that she should not expect anything from him
 vah usase kahati he ki pragna jo kar rahi he use karne de, shaadi ko paanch din bache hai isliye use aisa kuch nahin karnaa chahie jisase shaadi main koi pareshaani ho
 The comments duusari taraf daadi or daasi baat karte hai ki abhi ko apane dil kii baat pragna se kah deni chahie
 Dasi tells Dadi about the surprise that Abhi has kept for her
 unki baat tanu sun leti he, lekin daasi use apni baton main ulajhaa detii he
 Tanu is happy to hear about getting surprise himself
 album ke launch ke maukey par abhi kahata he ki pehle vah sirf gale se gaata tha lekin ab dil se gaata he
 He says that his greatest support in the album has been from his friend Purab
 abhi kahata he ki is album kii prerana use pragna se mili he

 tippaniyan On the other hand grandmother and maid talk that Abhi should tell her heart to Pragya
 daasi daadi ko us sarprise ke bare main bataati he jo abhi ne uske liye rakhaa he
 Tanu listens to them, but the maid confuses her in her words
 khud ko sarprise milane kii baat sun tanu khush ho jaati he
 At the launch of the album, Abhi says that earlier he used to sing only with a hug but now sings from the heart
 vah kahata he ki album main use sabase bada saport uske dost purab kaa rahaa he
 Abhi says that she got inspiration from this album from Pragya

 Due to his statements, Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Babulal Gaur, who is often in the discussion, has once again given a controversial statement
 is baar unhone sharaab ko lekar bayaan dete hue kaha ki sharaab pinaa koi aparaadh nahin he, yah kisi bhi naagarik kaa sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 He said, 'drinking alcohol has now become a status symbol
 sharaab pine se aparaadh nahin badhate, jo sanbhalkar pite hai unase koi aparaadh nahin hota
 After indulging, they go away and commit the same crime
 'darasal, grahamantri se indore ke paas kajaligarh kile main gangrape ke 45 maamalon ormahilaon kii suraksha ko lekar sawalkia gaya tha
 Along with this, he made this statement when questioned about increasing the opening time of the liquor shops

 President Pranab Mukherjee's address to the country has created a political fire
 bijepi ne jahaan kaha he ki mahamahim ne aisa kisi karanvash bolaa he to vahiin aap party ne kaha ki yah salaah sabhi siyaasi dalon ke liye he
 However, the Congress said that the statement should be respected
 filmkaar shekhar kapur ne raashtrapati ke bhaashan par twitor par likhaa he ki andolan or araajaktaa ek cheez nahin he
 There was anarchy in 1984, when the Sikhs were massacred by the mob
 1984 main state or police ne bheed ko uksaaya tha
 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has further enhanced the scandal by taking Shekhar Kapur's tweet further
 aam aadmi party ke netaa yogendra yadav kaa kahana he ki raashtrapati kaa ishaara hamaari ore nahin he
 On the other hand, the BJP has welcomed the President's speech
 bijepi netaa balvir punj ne kaha he ki raashtrapati desh ke sabase sammanit vyakti he
 BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said that if the president says something about anarchy, there must be some reason behind it
 rudi ne kaha ki is baar janata sthaayee sarkaar ke liye vot degi or hamaari party ko hi bahumat milegaa
 Union Minister Rajiv Shukla says on the President's speech that we should respect his words
 vahiin ensipi netaa tarik anwar ne kaha ki meri samaj se raashtrapati ne kejariwal ke bataur mukhyamantri kaamkaaj kii aalochana kii he
 It is a storm that the President said in the name of the country on the eve of Republic Day that the rise of hypocrisy in public life is dangerous
 loklubhaavan araajaktaa, shashan kaa vikalp nahin ho sakati
 He said that those who want the trust of the voters should make the same promise as possible
 jhuthe vaadon se logon kaa mohabhang hota he or unka gussa badhata he
 The Supreme Court said on Tuesday that there needs to be a balance between online privacy and state rights
 isse un logon par viraam lagegaa jo aatank failaane or aparaadh karne ke liye internet or web kaa upyog karte hai
 This will help in identifying such people
 supreme court main justise deepak gupta or aniruddh bose ne kaha ki hamen nahin pataa ki ise kaise acces kiya ja saktaa he lekin hamen ye jaankaree he ki kaise web kaa durupyog karke samaaj main galat chijen failaai ja rahi hai
 The bench said this while hearing a petition by the Tamil Nadu government
 atorni general keke venugopal ne kaha ki is maamle main farji khabaron ke prasar, manahani, ashleel, raashtra virdohi or aatankwaad se sambandhit saamagree ke pravaah ko rokane ke liye soshal media acount ko uske upyogkartaaon ke aadhaar number se jodne kii jarurat he
 Facebook is opposing the Tamil Nadu government's suggestion
 uskaa kahana he ki 12-ankon kii aadhaar sankhya ko saajha karne se yujar kii gopneeyata niti kaa ulanghan hoga
 Then the Supreme Court said that the central government, Google, whatsapp, Twitter, youtube and others in this case should issue notice by September 13 and reply
 atorni general keke venugopal ne apni daleel main kaha ki soshal media ko aadhaar se jodne se yah pataa chalegaa ki soshal media par phek news, apmanjanak lekh, ashleel saamagree, raashtra virdohi or aatank samarthit contate koun daal rahaa he
 Because right now the government is unable to know from where such content originates
 fasebuk ne kaha ki aadhaar link karne se gopneeyata bhang hogisoshal media ko aadhaar se link karne ke virodh main fasebuk ne kaha ki vah aadhaar number ko kisi tisare paksh ke saath saajha nahin kar saktaa he
 Because, sharing the 12-digit Aadhaar number and biometric unique identity would violate users' privacy policy
 yachikakarta kii daleel - aadhaar link karne se aparaadhiyon kaa pataa chalegkhatorni general keke venugopal, tamilnadu sarkaar ke vakil balaji shrinivasana ne panjikrut upyogkartaaon ke soshal media profile ko unke aadhaar number se jodne kii aavashyaktaa ke bare main apil par thi
 This will help in detecting the crimes by which criminal elements are working to spread violence through social media
 supreme court bank khaaton, mobile numberon ko aadhaar se jodne ko asanvaidhanik bol chukaa hesupreme court aadhaar ko kisi ke bank khate or mobile numberon se jodne ko anivaary rup se asanvaidhanik qaraar diya tha
 Therefore, banks and telecom operators can no longer insist that accounts and mobile numbers be linked to Aadhaar
 aadhaar se jude maujuuda khaaton or mobile numberon kaa kya hota he, yah spasht nahin he
 Why did this matter reach? Senior lawyers Mukul Rohatgi and Kapil Sibal, who are fighting the case on behalf of Supreme Court, Social Media, said that 2 such cases are currently going on in Madras High Court, 1-1 in Bombay High Court and Madhya Pradesh High Court
 inke faisle ho sakate hai ki puure desh ke liye sahi na ho, isliye ise supreme court main laayaa gaya he taaki faisla puure desh ke liye lagu ho
