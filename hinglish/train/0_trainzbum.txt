 In Madhya Pradesh, the controversy over urea is not taking its name
 guna jile main to somvaar ko khaad vitaran ke dauraan bavaal itnaa bad gaya ki police ko hangaamaa kar rahe kisaanon par laathiyaan bhaanjani padi
 These days, like other areas of the state, there is a fierce situation in Guna
 sirf guna hi nahi balki chhatarpur jile main bhi khaad vitaran ko lekar kisaanon main rosh he or unhone jabardast hangaamaa kiya
 Farmers were taking manure by planting a line in Nanakhedi Agricultural Produce Market of Guna on Monday
 khaad baantne main deree kii vajah se kisaanon kaa sabar jawaab de gaya or wo hangaamaa karne lage
 Seeing the commotion, the police chased the farmers by lathi-charge
 congress ke varisht netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya guna se saansad hai or unke hi sansadeey kshetra main kisaanon ko uria ke liye sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he
 Not only Guna, but also in Chhatarpur district, there was a tremendous ruckus about fertilizer
 khaad ke liesubah se lambii qatari main lage kisaanon ne deree se naaraaz hokarkisansuvidha centre ke saamne neshnal hive par tractaron ko khadaa kar jam laga diya
 As soon as the information was received about the case, the policemen calmly informed the matter and opened the jam
 jald khatm hoga sankatdusri ore, madhya pradesh kii naisarkaarka daawa he ki centre se lagaataar baatcheet ke baad pradesh main uria sankat dhire-dhire khatm hone ke asaar hai
 According to information received from the Agriculture Department, the Union Ministry of Fertilizers and Chemicals has agreed to immediately supply 25,000 metric tons of urea
 vibhaag ke mutabik disambar main madhya pradesh main ab tak kareeb 2 lakh 15 hajaar metric ton uria kii aapurti hui he jabaki kareeb 50 hajaar metric ton uria pradesh main pahunchane vaala he
 Apart from this, the state government has requested the Center to distribute urea from NFL Vijaypur, Guna plant in Madhya Pradesh itself
 vibhaag ke mutabik madhya pradesh ko pehle rojaanaa 6 se 7 rek uria mil rahaa tha jo ab badhkar 10 rek ho gaya he
 The 2013-14 budget is the last budget before the elections

 What is the main bottleneck? In the period of high growth between 2003 and 2007, the rate of savings / investment was also seen to be high but it did not get any benefit due to non-productive government expenditure
 vittiya majbootee or vikaas ke bich sidhaa sambandh he
 The problem of forest / environmental clearance and land acquisition arising from the delay in the decision-making of the government caused a scourge
 gathbandhan kii raajnneeti or sansad kii aadchan asal main ek bahaanaa he jisase asal mudda darkinar ho jaataa he
 Reforms should have only a two-point agenda: accelerate investment again and cut government spending
 retail main epadi, pension, beemaa ko sajaa-sanvarkar pesh karne se videshi niveshkon or reating agenciyon kaa dil to baag-baag ho gaya hoga, lekin isse kisi masale kaa samaadhaan nahin hua
 Budget 2013-14 will be about the numbers around five
 pehla, vruddhi 5
 Is hovering around 5 percent
 iske liye greek / mali ko dosha nahin diya ja saktaa yaa arthvyavastha main sudhaar kii aprihaary jarurat ke bare main sirf ichha rakh lene se nau fisadi kii chaal tak waapas nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa
 Poverty / unemployment will have to be reduced for nine percent
 sadakon par phikr sirf yon aparaadhon or bhrashtachar ko lekar hi nahin he balki aarthik vruddhi ke sust padane or aarthik avasaron ke fike padane kii bhi chintaa he
 In a way, every budget is 14
 5 fisadi kii nominal growth ko project karata he
 7
 5 fisadi kii real growth or 7 fisadi kii mahangaai ko dekhte hue yah shaayad kuch alag baat nahin he
 Secondly, there is a figure of inflation which the government ideally wants to keep around 5
 yah sarkaar kaa sapana he
 Due to the absence of any improvement in agriculture, agricultural production is not increasing
 nivesh main aadchan se menuphaccharing supplai main bhi vruddhi nahin ho rahi he or kachche maal kii oonchi laagat kii vajah se is sector ko or pareshaani ho rahi he
 The government has little control over imported inflation
 antim baat, sarkari kharch badhaane kii bhi kam hi saraahna kii jaati he kyonki isse vyavastha main nakadi aati he or mahangaai badhati he
 That way we have a third figure around five, the fiscal deficit / GDP ratio
 vitt mantri yah sunishchit karne kii koshish karenge ki 2012-13 ke sanshodhit anumaan main yah 5
 Stay at 3 per cent and reduce it further to 5 per cent in the 2013-14 budget estimates
 sabsidi vaale daur main pramukh sudhaaron ke saadhan ke rup main sidhe nakadi dene or yuidi kii kaaphi charchaa ho chuki he
 Till now cash transfer has been restricted to scholarship / pension and UID has been embroiled in many problems of implementation
 petroleum utpaadon kii sabsidi ko lekar kuch prayaas chal rahe hai, lekin sarkari niyantran vaale keemat tantra ko khatm karne yaa usamen amul badlaav karne or bipiel pahachaanapatr ke saath sabsidi ko target karne ke bare main koi sanket nahin mil rahaa he
 Looking at the many forms of food subsidy bill, it seems that this scheme is far from being targeted
 isliye ek chote bindu ke rup main dekhen to prastaavit badlaav bajtiy sabsidi bill par maamuli (yadi aisa kuch hua) chot hi karenge
 As a big point, the much-publicized reform in these much-talked about reforms, less the elements
 tab aakhir vitt mantri aankadon kaa management kaise karenge? yah kathin nahin he
 Just reduce the budget of expenses and mercilessly cut the grants of ministries
 gaiyr-tex sahit sabhi praptiyon kaa zyada anumaan lagaaein
 It is better to take recourse to statistics
 tex daron ko badhaane ke suzav bhi saamne aa rahe hai
 This is contrary to the arguments made by the current Prime Minister and the current Finance Minister as Finance Ministers in 1991, 1995 and 1997
 oonchi daron kii vyavastha chal nahin paati he
 Unfortunately rural income is not touched at all
 baaki bache hue saat karod shahari pariwaron ke liye tex aadhaar badhaakar tex / jidipi anupaat badhanaa chahie, daren badhaakar nahin
 After increasing Aadhaar, the number of exemptions also comes
 is bajet main kuch tex chhuton ko khatm kiya ja saktaa he, lekin cash transfar or jiesti, donon ke tal jane se tex chhuton ko bade paimaane par khatm karne kii sambhaavna nahin dikh rahi he
 So saliva can be dripped for an attractive possibility of raising rates, even if done through a pseudo-route of cess / surcharge
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki tex chori hoti he, lekin aisa kaaphi had tak chhuton kaa phayda uthaate hue vaidhanik tareeke se kiya jaataa he
 Ignoring this, the UPA-2 government is constantly reminding the 1970s of targeting the salaried class (which cannot use the exemptions) and raising public expenditure
 anya chizomen sarkari hastkshep badaae se bhi yah baat pukhta hoti he
 If we reach the growth rate of the '70s, it would not be surprising

 By the end of 1998, Pakistani intelligence agency inter-services Intelligence (ISI) understood that it was meaningless for him to continue to support harkat-ul-mujahideen
 mujahidin america suraksha agenciyon ke nishane par tha kyonki iske commander moulana fajalur rahamaan khalil ne osama bin laden ke al-kaayda se haath milaate hue america ke khilaaf fatwa jari kiya tha
 Since then, the US has been pressuring Pakistan to take action against it
 iske baad, 31 disambar, 1999 ko indian airlines kii apahrit udaan isi-814 ke yatriyon ke badale main bharat se masood ajahar kii rihaai or pakistan ke jehadi halkon main uske bade hue kad ke maddenjar iesai ne us par daanv lagaaya
 By pressuring the Deobandi Ulema in the Binori mosque of Karachi, the ISI made Masood Azhar their leader and thus jaish-e-muhammad was born on 31 January 2000
 masood ko aage badhaane ke kram main iesai ne jab use pakistan sthit jehadi samoohon kaa saajha netaa banane kaa prastaav rakhaa to use hijb-ul-mujahidin ke saiyad salahuddin, lashkar-e-taiyaba (eliti) ke hafiz mohammad said tathaa harakat-ul-mujahidin ke khalil ke kade pratirodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 All these groups enjoy strong patronage of the Pakistani power establishment and none of them wanted to lose arms supply, financial support and military security
 aise main iesai kii baat unhen kisi had tak manani hi thi
 In order to help Masood, the ISI also pressurized members of harkat-ul-mujahideen to change their allegiance in favor of Masood and put Masood in control of training camps, financial resources and weapons in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 idhar ghati main puraa harakat-ul-mujahidin raturaat jaish-e-mohammad main badal gaya
 The ongoing rivalry between jaish-e-muhammad and lashkar-e-taiba from Pakistan spread to Jammu and Kashmir and the rest of India
 yah pratidwandvita aaj tak vikrut aatanki pratispardhaa ke rup main jari he ki koun-sa samooh pakistan kii god main chhipe baithe apane aakaaon ko khush karne ke liye bade dussahasik hamale kar saktaa he
 For him, every successful attack means more recruitments, wealth and status
 jaish-e-mohammad ne kashmir main apni maujuudagi kaa elaan 25 disambar, 2000 ko srinagar kii badami baag chhavnee sthit sena kii 15veen kor ke mukhyalay ke mukhyadwar par aatmghaatee car bam hamale se kiya
 The reason for choosing the Army Headquarters for the attack was that a few days ago on November 23, 2000, Lashkar had also targeted the camp and killed unarmed public relations officers and allies of the army
 masood jab yuvaaon ko prerit karne, bhartee karne or unhen saidhantik ghutti pilaa kar kashmir main hinsa bhadakaane ke uddeshy se pakistan main bharat ke khilaaf jehar ugalta tha to ghati main uskaa pramukh commander taahir nadeem rana urf gaji baba ghaatak hamalon kii shrunkhlaa chalaa rahaa tha
 Both Ghazi Baba and Masood were from Bahawalpur in Pakistani Punjab
 jammu-kashmir vidhansabha par 1 aktubar, 2001 ko kiye hamale ke baad gaji baba ghati main sarvaadhik vaanchit aatankwaadi ban gaya
 His involvement in the attack on Parliament on 13 December 2001 and being the main planner of several suicide attacks in Kashmir increased his notoriety which eventually came to an end with his being killed by the Border Security Force in Srinagar on 30 August 2003 
 us samay tak kashmir main sabhi suraksha agenciyon ne uske sanghathan main paith bana lee thi
 In the same period, the ISI clamped down on the organization after being suspected of being involved in an attempt to assassinate former President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf on 28 December 2003
 haalanki baad main iesai ne jab mahasoos kiya ki uske liye keval ek samooh lashkar-e-taiyaba par nirbhar rahanaa thik nahin he to usne apni niti badal lee or jaish-e-mohammad par pratibandhon main dheel de di
 jaish-e-muhammad is on the move to regain notoriety since the ban was relaxed and the Pulwama attack is his latest adventure
 is hamale ke gambhir suraksha nihitarth hai kyonki isamen sthaneey yuvaaon kii bhagidaari kaa ek nayaa aayam he jo pakistan ko isamen shaamil hone ke aaropon se bachaae rakhane main madad karegaa
 This raises the need for a reevaluation of India's overall approach to dealing with all aspects of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir

 bharat ke madhyam gati ke gendbaaj bhubaneshwar kumaar kaa maananaa he ki trentbrij kii bejaan pich par england ko do baar out karke pehla test match jeetne ke liye unhen or gendbaaji ke unke saathiyon ko dhairya baratna hoga
 Trentbridge's pitch is flat, due to which he is also criticized
 bhubaneshwar kaa bhi maananaa he ki england ke ballebaaji kram ko dhahaane ke liye bhartiya gendbaajon ko anushaasit pradarshan karnaa hoga
 "we cannot do anything about the pitch," he told a press conference after the second day's play was over
 hamen dhairya baratna hoga
 It is very much like the Indian pitch and we have to bowl wicket to wicket
 hamen aisi paristhitiyon main khilne kaa kaaphi anubhav he or isliye ham jaanate hai ki kya karne kii jarurat he
 Bhuvneshwar said, even though the pitch may not have changed, it may take some turn later
 ham igland ko out karne ke prati aashwast hai or hamen aisa karnaa hoga, kyonki ham yah match jeetna chaahate hai
 The England bowlers had to work very hard to cover the Indian innings
 bhubaneshwar or mohammad shami ne antim wicket ke liye 111 ran kii saajhedaari karke england kii pareshaani badhaai
 Bhuvneshwar, who scored the first half-century (58) of his career, said, "I don't think England bowled poorly
" unhone ham par kaaphi dabaav daalaa
 They adopted different things and applied different fielding
 is tarah kii pich par aapako kuch alag karne kii jarurat hoti he
 If there is a century partnership for the last wicket, the bowlers will be tired and desperate
 isliye unhone kuch koshish kii or hamane bhi apni taraf se prayaas kiya

 aspx The Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) may have to face the wrath of the Indian cricket board as the association violated the board's instructions to former BCCI secretary Jaywant Lele and former Test cricketer Nayan Mongia for the one-dayer between India and New Zealand
 Did not give the pavilion pass
 bisisiai ne haal main ek circular jari karte hue match yojit kar rahe sangh ko antarrashtriya match ke liye board ke purv adhyakshon, sachivon or purv test cricketron ko pavilion paas bhejne ke liye kaha tha
 Lele said, 'but the BCA gave me and Nayan Mongia another pass pass for the match between India and New Zealand

 ' bharat aurajapanke sahyog se ban rahi ahmedabad-mumbaibulate trainke project main nit nai adchane saamne aati ja rahi hai
 After the protest in Mumbai, 1000 farmers have moved the High Court in Gujarat against this project
 in kisaanon ne halafanama dekar court se apil kii he ki bullate train ke kaam roka jaae
 1
 08 lakh karod rupee kii laagat vaale is project ko neshnal hai speed rail korporation limited (NHSRCL) aage badha rahaa he
 Japan has provided 80% of the funds of this project under soft loans to India
 is project main gujarat or maharashtra main kareeb 1,400 hectare jameen kii jarurat he
 Of this, 1,120 hectares are owned by private owners
 is jameen ko donon rajyon kii sarkaron ko adhigrahan karnaa he
 Approximately 6,000 people are to be compensated in return for this land
 gujarat hai court main pehle hi surat ke paanch kisaanon kii apil kii sunwaayee chal rahi he
 These farmers have opposed the Gujarat government's way of acquiring land
 iske baad ab 1,000 kisaanon ne kaha he ki ve apni jameen is project ke liye nahin dena chaahate hai
 These farmers say that guidelines are being violated in the acquisition of land
 kisaanon kaa aashay is project ko fund dene vaali japan international kooparation agency (JICA) ke nirdeshon se he
 It calls for making committees to review the acquisition's social and social impact, which has not been seen in this case
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki isse unhen paryaapt muaavja bhi nahin mil rahaa he
 The farmers demand that the central government acquire land for this project
 kisaanon ke mutabik chunki jameen kaa adhigrahan do rajyon main hona he, isliye centre isamen shaamil ho or donon rajyon ke kisaanon ko samaan dar se muaavja mili
 Farmers have also accused the Gujarat government of weakening the Land Acquisition Rules (2013) in 2016
 bataa den ki ab kisaan centre sarkaar ke rukh ke khilaaf bhi supreme court main bhi ja sakate hai
 They say that the Center is deliberately delaying filing its reply in the Gujarat High Court

 There was a huge uproar in the Assembly today with the trust vote of Maharashtra Kafdnavis government
 vishwaas mat kaa virodh kar rahe shivasena or congress ke netaaon ne mumbai main vidhansabha ke baahar governor kii gaadi roki or rajyapal waapas jaao ke naare lagaae
 During this time, the governor also received some injuries
 governor kii gaadi rokane ke aarope main congress ke 5 vidhayakon ko do saal ke liye suspend kar diya gaya he
 The opposition leaders, who created a ruckus demanding voting on the trust vote, prevented Governor Vidyasagar Rao from going to the Assembly
 rajyapal vidhansabha ko sambodhit karne ja rahe the
 The governor, who was surrounded on all sides, had to face a push
 surakshakarmiyon ke liye vidhayakon ko hataanaa mushkil ho rahaa tha
 During this time the Governor also suffered an injury
 kisi tarah rajyapal ko sadan ke andar pahunchaaya gaya
 Leaders of the opposition shouted slogans against the Governor even inside the House
 vipakshi netaaon ne sadan ke bheetar bhi rajyapal waapas jaao ke naare lagaae
 However, the Governor completed the address amidst the uproar
 baad main congress ke vidhayakon rahul bondre, abdul sattaar, amar kaale, virendra jagataap or jai kumaar gore ko suspend kar diya gaya
 The congress-shiv Sena protest over the vote of confidence of the government of Dharna Fadnavis when it was passed by voice vote in the House

 The Congress alleged that the majority was not achieved in a constitutional manner
 vahiin, shivasena ne dobaaraa vishwasamat pesh karne kii chunauti di he
 Speaker gave the cleaning The new speaker of the Assembly, Haribhau Bagde, has given his clarification on the whole matter
 unhone kaha he ki jab sadan main kaarywahi chal rahi thi us dauraanshivsenaor congress ne aapatti nahin uthaai
 When he asked if there was any opposition to the motion of confidence, he did not say anything at that time
 lekin jab spikar ne faisla le liya tab usapar sawaal uthaae gaye hai or congress isliye virodh kar rahi he kyonki unase netaa vipaksh kaa pad nahin mila he
 Traffic rules are designed to protect people, but many people do not follow them and where the traffic police do not appear, they violate these rules openly
 aise main bengalooru police (bangalore Police) ne bada hi anokhaa kamad uthaate hue ek pahal kii he
 In fact, the Bangalore Police has put mannequins on the streets wearing traffic police uniforms so that people do not consider them as traffic police and violate the rules
 khabar kemutabik shuruyaat main bangaleru police ne shahar main 30 putalon ko trephic police kii vardi main alag-alag sthanon par khadaa kiya he
 Police believe that by doing so, people will follow traffic rules
 in putalon ko riflactor jacket, safed shart, khaaki pants, topi or kaale juute pahana kar shahar kii alag-alag jagahon par khadaa kiya gaya he or samay-samay par inaki jagah ko badal diya jaataa he taaki logon ko isaki aadat na ho
 Let me tell you, about 71 lakh vehicles run on the streets of Bengaluru, a city with a population of 1 crore 20 lakh, from which the traffic police collects a revenue of 1 crore to 1 crore 5 lakh rupees every year
 police kaa kahana he ki chalaan vasuulne kii jagah praathamikta durghatnaon ko rokna he
 In such a situation, whenever a new idea comes up, the police adopts it
 bengalooru mirar kii report ke mutabik putalon kaa istemaal keval din ke vakt kiya jaataa he or raat ke vakt inhen hataa diya jaataa he
 While some people are appreciating this initiative of Bengaluru Police on Twitter, some are reacting differently to it
 dekhen twitssthhile it is an interesting idea, it will most likely fail because this mannequin looks fitter than all the cops
 May be they should add a bit of a paunch to make it more realistic
 i think it is good experiment
 Keep shifting the mannequin frequently to different locations
 Looks like our very own Michael jaykishan
 Moonwalk plz
 i hope 'fair & Handsome' is underwriting this
 However, this is not the first time the police have taken such a step
 police hameshaa kisi na kisi tareeke se logon ko trephic rules ke prati jaagruk karti rahati he
 The National War Memorial, in honor of the martyrs in Delhi, was dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today
 ye smarak azaadi ke baad desh ke liye jaan qurbaan karne vaale vir sainikon ke sammaan main taiyaar kiya gaya he

 aap sabhi ne raashtra ke liye jo kiya he vah adbhoot he
 This memorial is also a symbol of how it is proven by taking resolution
 aisa hi ek sankalp maine aapke saamne kiya tha 'van rank van pension' kaa

 This war memorial is just to remember his martyrs for their martyrdom
 yah hamaare liye garv kii baat he ki ham aise desh main rahete hai, jisaki raksha hamaare jaabaj jawan karte hai
 After independence, 22 thousand 500 soldiers sacrificed their lives for the nation
 in sabhi shaheedon ko shradhanjali dene ke liye ek aise war memorial kii jarurat thi
 The memorial commemorates all the battles this country has fought so far
 unhen shradhanjali detaa he
 The Memorial will have four Chakras, Amar Chakra, Vir Chakra, Tyagna Chakra and Raksha Chakra
 is maukey par main is project team ko badhai dena chaahati hum, jinhone is project se judakar ise banaaya he
 He said that the design of this Memorial is unique
 ham chaahate hai ki apane bahadur shaheedon ko yaad karne ke liye har bhartiya yahaan aae or unhen apni shradhanjali den
 The construction of the National War Memorial has cost about Rs 176 crore
 bataa den ki is memorial main shahid hue 26 hajaar sainikon ke naam hai
 Now events related to the martyrs will be held at the National War Memorial instead of Amar Jawan Jyoti
 is project par kareeb 176 karod rupee kii laagat ai he
 It was created in honor of the soldiers who were martyred in 1947–48, the Goa Liberation Movement in 1961, the war with China in 1962, the war with Pakistan in 1965, the creation of Bangladesh in 1971, the Siachen in 1987, Sri Lanka in 1987–88 and the Kargil in 1999
 has gone
 vaise dilli main india get main bhi ek yuddh smarak he, lekin wo pratham vishwayuddh or afgaan ladaai ke dauraan shahid hue sainikon ke yaad main bana he
 After this, Amarjwan Jyoti was made in memory of the soldiers who died in the 1971 war

 The Central Statistics Office ie CSO in India fixes a base year for evaluation of production and services

 GDP is the total cost of production of goods and services within a country during a particular period
 bharat main jidipi kii gananaa har tisare maheene yani timahi aadhaar par hoti he
 If the GDP figure increases, it means that the country's pace of development is moving on track
 vahiin agar ye aankade lagaataar kam hote hai to desh ke liye khatre kii ghanti hoti he
 Due to lower GDP, the average income of the people decreases and people go below the poverty line
 iske alaava nai naukariyaan paidaa hone kii raftaar bhi sust pad jaati he
 Please tell here that the CSO, the government organization, releases these figures
 rohinee court ne aam aadmi party netaa ashutosh ke khilaaf exiaar darj karne ke aadesh die hai
 Actually, Rohini court judge Ekta Gaba has ordered the SHO of Begampur to file an FIR against Gandhi, Nehru and Atal Bihari Bajpayee for making indecent remarks
 maamla saal 2016 kaa he jab aam aadmi party ke mantri sandip kumaar kii ashleel sidi ke saamne aane ke baad mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne unhen mantripad se hataa diya tha
 Kejriwal had said that he had removed 'dirty fish' from his party
 aam aadmi party ke pravaktaa ashutosh ne sandip kumaar kaa bachaav karte hue kaha tha ki sandip ne kuch bhi galat nahin kiya he, rashtrapita mahatma gandhi, pandit jawahar laal nehru or purv pradhan mantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke bhi saamaajik or naitik daayre se baahar jaakar duusari mahilaon se rishte rahe hai
 Ashutosh's remarks were severely criticized by the Congress, including the BJP
 is vivaad ke baad rohinee court main arji lagaakar unke khilaaf aam logon kii bhaawanaaon ko aahat karne ke aarope lagaakar exiaar darj karne kii guhaar lagaai gai thi
 On which the court has now ordered the police to register an FIR
 gauratlab ye bhi he ki jab yahsidi kandahua tha to khud arvind kejariwal ne sandip kumaar ko gandi machhlee kaha tha
 But Ashutosh, who defended Sandeep Kumar at that time, was also seen recently in protest against the death penalty of rape convicts, due to which he was criticized a lot
 hamaari zindagi ko raajnneeti jitna prabhavit karti he, usase kahin zyaada arthvyavastha bhi karti hogi, lekin jab yah sankat se guzar rahi he, mauka he yah samajhane kaa ki akhir teen saal main hua kya ki ham is mode par aa pahunche hai, to raajnneeti ne hindu-muslim topic khoj liya he
 Even today you can see on all the channels there is a discussion of Hindu Muslim topic in one form or the other
 zaruri nahin he ki jo aaj sankat he, wo kal bhi rahe
 But what is today, it should be talked about
 hamaari arthvyavastha sankat ke daur se guzar rahi he
 There is a huge decline in market and business
 rojgaar ke avasar isse prabhavit ho rahe hai
 Is the dock media constantly entrenched in Hindu Muslim topics to avoid these questions
 jiesti ko lekar vyapaariyon, chartered acountint or tex vakeelon se jitani baat karata hum utani baar lag rahaa he ki ek patrkaar ke naate is samasya ke ek pratishat hisse tak bhi nahin pahunch paa rahaa hum
 Obviously the crisis is big and the dimensions are many
 aaj hamane rajasthan ke tex kansaltent sangh ke satish gupta se baat kii
 The input that i got from them, i want to present here as a list
 jaipur main 20 sitambar ke baad bhi portal sahi se kaam nahin kar rahaa tha
 The message kept coming throughout the day that you are in queue, the day has not passed
 vyapaariyon ke saath tex vakil or sie sabhi dabaav main kaam kar rahe hai
 It would have been better to have a quarterly return filing instead of monthly
 port sirf angrezi main he, iske kaaran vyapaaree na samaj paa rahe hai na bhar paa rahe hai
 There is no room for correction if the button is submitted by mistake
 jaise koi rakam, kisi duusare mad main jamaa ho jaae to use sudhaarney kaa mauka nahin mil rahaa he
 As soon as the government says, there will be no penalty for delay in filling the 3B form, but it is being taken
 ek din kii deree par 200 rupee jurmaana he
 Often due to the portal there is a delay in filling the form, even then there is a penalty
 yah dharna sahi nahin he ki is kaaran se sie or tex vakil mouj kar rahe hai balki hakeekat yah he ki ve bhi kaaphi pareshaan hai
 The trouble of traders is even greater
 bill se dhandha karne kii aadat nahin thi or ab bill sambhalate sambhalate pareshaan hai
 Merchants who have a large set up, ie those who have a system of accountants, etc
 have less trouble but GST has increased the headache for the general store, medical store or any retail business
 in logon ke paas paanch sau hazaar kii sankhya main bill hote hai, jisaki soochna bharte bharte kai ghante lag jate hai
 Previously, the merchant used to pay CA for a full year Rs 1500, now he has to pay twenty to twenty five thousand rupees for the whole year
 jiesti ne laghu va madhyam shrenee ke bijnesaman or udhyamiyon ko pareshaan kar diya he
 The question has arisen whether they will survive in the market or not
 hamane ek sawaal poocha ki aakhri din vyapaaree kyon bharte hai to iskaa jawaab yun mila Then you tell me why these last dates are kept
 aapkaa system last date ke hisaab se taiyaar kyon nahin he
 Should the merchant leave all the work and get the returns filled? Can not all traders fill GST by themselves? tex conslatent se baat karne par pataa chalaa ki chote shaharon main sthiti or bhi karaab he
 Internet does not work, but it runs slow
 ofline form bharkar jab aap online main migrat karaate hai to kai baar system sweekaar nahin karata he
 The condition is that there are 250 clients, but even after three to four days GST of 50% could not be filled
 rifund kii samasya vyapaaree khub uthaa rahe hai
 They are saying that when July refunds will be received after November 10, then august-september and October refunds will be available after March next year
 is kaaran vyapaariyon ke haath main paisa hi nahin he
 Payment is stuck at every level
 jinhone bank se lone liye hai, wo baad main alag se byaaz bhi bharenge
 We spoke to an officer of the All India Transport Association, listing what they told us
 jiesti ke aane ke baad se transport sector kii haalat or karaab ho gai he
 In July, the turnover had come down to 20 percent, in August it came to 50 percent
 sitambar main 60 fisadi tak pahunchaa he magar ab bhi 30-40 fisadi bijness down he
 There has not been a significant difference in the timing of the trucks' rounds as the octroi had moved everywhere except Maharashtra
 dilli mumbai root par zarur trek ke pahunchane ke samay main das ghante kii kami ai he
 There are several reasons for this
 abhi bhi badi sankhya main vyapaariyon kaa registration nahin hua he
 Without registration the transporter cannot pick up their cargo because it will be caught
 nayaa niyam aisa hi he
 Still, the goods of those who have not been registered are going from here to there
 kaise ho rahaa he
 It is happening that the transporters taking the risk for this are charging twice as much
 is vakt sarkaar checking karne kii sthiti main nahin he
 But a large number of transporters want only the registered merchants to pick up the goods, but the business of those who have registered has reduced by 40 to 50 percent
 unke paas se transporter ko order nahin mil rahaa he
 Therefore trucks in warehouses are standing in large numbers which is not a good sign for any business or economy
 bijness down hone kaa trakon par or asar padaa he
 For example, trucks from Delhi which have gone south due to freight, are stuck there
 kyonki vahaan kii factriyon main utpaadan down he, trakon ko maal nahin mil rahaa he
 Therefore, instead of returning, they have been stuck in the cities of the south for a week
 transporter ne bataaya ki kam se kam 1000 se lekar 2000 tak trek dilli ke vahaan atake honge
 This never happened in the Diwali season
 ye sirf trek kii baat he, agar aap isamen transport main istamaal hone vaali trailor,chote trek, tampo ko bhi shaamil karenge to tasviir kuch or nazar aegi
 We have written all these things on the basis of conversation so that we know what is happening on the ground
 kisi bhi vyapaaree ne nahin kaha ki ve tex nahin dena chaahate
 Everyone wants to give but is very upset with the process and the rate of taxes
 maine rajasthan ke kuch vyapaar sanghon ke pratinidhiyon se phone par baat kii
 The business of marble, handi craft and gold jewelery is very important in Rajasthan
 pehle donon par 28 fisadi jiesti lagi he or gold jewelri par 3 fisadi jiesti lagi he
 Sitaram Agarwal Saheb of Steel Association said that our business has been down by 40%
 tiamati saria, angel, panel in sab kii bikri bahut hi kam rah gai he
 In factories where three shifts were going on, there are two shifts
 over time karne vaale kii kamai kam ho gai kyonki over time band he yaa kam he
 Daily laborers are not getting work in every sector, this is the most affected
 vaise bhi bainkon ke en pi e main 39 fisadi hissaa steel sector kaa hi he
 In Rajasthan, the consumption of petrol and diesel has come down by six and a half percent
 ham sarkaar ko positive suzav dete hai, magar koi ection nahin hota
 The diagnosis of problems at the local level has stopped
 isi tarah hamane jaipur ke pattharon ko taraash kar fansy item banane vaale ek kaarobaari se baat hui
 On the condition of anonymity, he said that his business has fallen by 80 percent
 28 fisadi jiesti ke kaaran chizein itani mahangi ho gayi ki logon ne shaukia kareed band kar di
 The business of the first month was from fifty to six lakhs, which has now come down to ten to 15 lakhs
 iskaa asar rojgaar par padaa he
 They told that hamaari factory main jo mahange or sthaayee acountint the unako hataanaa padaa
 Many such people were trimmed and replaced with part time work
 teen teen kantrector the, harek ke paas 10 se 15 mazdoor kaam kar rahe the
 Sent two contractors back in the first month, now called
 magar ab kisi kantrector ke paas do se teen mazaduron se zyada kaa kaam nahin he yani har kisi ke 10 se 12 mazaduron se kaam chhin gaya he
 Let us not confine the problem of GST to the portal, due to which the business has fallen and the work done by the daily earners is not accounted for
 ek pranali or teen tex vaali jiesti ke aagaman kaa swaagat 15 agast 1947 kii madhyaraatri kii tarah kiya gaya, jiesti ke kaaran jinke pet par chot padi he, kya unhen bulaakar sansad main sammanit nahin karnaa chahie
 Last time in prime time when we were talking about bank strike, a voice was heard saying that jobs in banking sector have reduced
 aam taur par is saal tak bank bhartiyon ke liye ai bi pi es ko bataa detii he,institute aaf banking personal salection naam kii yah sanstha bank sevaaon main bhartiyon ke liye pariksha yojit karti he
 Let's look at the data found from the IBPS website
 2015 main 24, 604 clerkon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 In 2016, an advertisement for the recruitment of 19,243 clerks came out
 ek saal main clerkon kii bhartee main 5,361 kii kami aa gai
 The recruitment of 7,883 clerks is vacant in 2017
 2016 se 17 ke bich 11,360 pad kam ho gaye
 Compared to 2015, 16,000 vacancies have decreased
 noujvaan aaj berojgaare ke registan main khadaa he or aapkaa netaa kabristaan kii baat kar rahaa he
 It cannot be said more clearly than this
 ab aate hai probationar afisar pio kii sankhya par
 The story here is also sad
 2015 main 12,434 post pio kaa niklaa tha
 In 2016, the direct 3612 was reduced to 8,822
 2017 main 3,562 pio kii hi vaikency nikali he
 That is, there are about 9000 less vacancies in 2017 as compared to 2015
 aaj ke hi indian express pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana par ek report chhapi he
 You will also read the reports of Anchal Magazine and Anil Sasi
 skill deveopment mantralay zila str par maang or aapurti kii samiksha kar rahaa he, data jamaa kar rahaa he
 After seeing the data up to the first week of July 2017, the picture coming out is horrifying
 usee se pataa chalata he ki kyon media rojgaar kii baat nahin karata, kyon hindu muslim taapic kii baat karata he
 This report of Express has written comments abhi tak kaushal vikaas yojana ke tahat 30 lakh 67 hazaar logon ko prashikshan diya gaya he yaa diya ja rahaa tha
 Out of these only 2 lakh 90 thousand have got work
 12,000 karod kii is yojana ke tahat chaar saal main ek karod yuvaaon ko training dene kaa lakshya he
 Now it is being thought that the quality of training is not average
 par kya quality itani ausat thi ki 30 lakh main se teen lakh ko bhi rojgaar nahin mila to phir is yojana ke tahat thik kya tha
 Isn't this figure intimidating, would you still like to leave a worry about the future of the youth and see the debate on Hindu Muslim topics
 karnaa kya he, naujavaanon ko dangai bananaa he yaa naagarik bananaa he
 There is no reliable and transparent data system for employment in our country
 itani chizon ke ap banate hai, ek ap isi kaa ban jaataa jisase yahi pataa chalata ki is maheene centre ke kis vibhaag ne yaa rajya sarkaron ke kis vibhaag ne naukariyaan nikaali hai
 But governments will not tell because you will know the reality
 susheel mahapatra kii report dekhie, jiesti ke asar par kya kehete hai ricycling factory vaale
 Even after September 20 in Jaipur, the portal was not functioning properly
 puure din massej aate rahaa ki aap qataar main he, din biit gaya qataar nahin beetaa
 Tax lawyers and cas are all working under pressure with traders
 acha hota masik kii jagah tremasik ritern bharne kii vyavastha hoti
 The port is in English only, due to which traders are unable to understand or fill it
 galati se batan sabamit ho gaya to sudhaar karne kii koi guzaaish nahin he
 For example, if any amount is deposited in some other item, then it is not getting a chance to improve
 sarkaar kahati hi 3 bi farm bharne kii deree par jurmaana nahin lagegaa, magar liya ja rahaa he
 There is a fine of 200 rupees for one day delay
 aksar portal ke kaaran farm bharne main deree ho rahi he, tab bhi jurmaana lag rahaa he
 The assumption is not correct that CA and tax lawyers are having fun for this reason, but the fact is that they are also very upset
 vyapaariyon kii pareshaani to or bhi badi he
 There was no habit of dealing with the bill and now they are worried about handling the bill
 jin vyapaariyon kaa set ap bada he yani jinke yahaan acountint vagairah kaa system he unhen kam pareshaani he lekin general store, medical store yaa kisi bhi retail bijness waalon ke liye jiesti ne saradard badha diya he
 These people have five hundred thousand bills, which takes several hours to fill the information
 pehle vyapaaree sie ko puure saal kaa 1500 rupee dekar kaam chalaa letaa tha ab use puure saal ke liye bees se pachis hazaar rupee dene pad rahe hai
 GST has upset small and medium-sized businessmen and entrepreneurs
 ve bazaar main tikenge yaa nahin, ye sawaal khadaa ho gaya he
 We asked a question as to why traders filled on the last day, so the answer was phir aap bataaiye ki ye last date rakhaa hi kyon hai
 Why your system is not ready according to the last date
 kya vyapaaree sara kaam chhodkar ritern hi bharwata rahe? saare vyapaaree khud se jiesti nahin bhar sakate hai? Talking to the tax consultant revealed that the situation is worse in small towns
 internet chalata nahin, chalata he to slo chalata he
 Many times the system does not accept when you migrate online by filling an offline form
 haalat yah he ki 250 client hai, magar teen chaar din lagane ke baad bhi 50% kii jiesti nahin bhari ja saki
 Merchants are raising the problem of refunds a lot
 kah rahe hai ki jab july kaa rifund 10 november ke baad milegaa to agast-sitambar or oktober kaa rifund to agle saal march ke baad milegaa
 Because of this, there is no money in the hands of traders
 har level par pement atka hua he
 Those who have taken loans from the bank, they will also pay separate interest later
 hamane akhil bhartiya transport sangh ke ek padaadhikari se baat kii unhone hamen jo bataaya use suchi baddh kar rahaa hum
 The condition of the transport sector has worsened since the introduction of GST
 july main to ghandha ghatakar 20 fisadi par aa gaya tha, agast main 50 fisadi tak aayaa
 60 percent reached in September but still 30-40 percent business down
 trakon ke phere ke samay main bhi khaas antar nahin aayaa he kyonki maharashtra ko chhod oktry har jagah se hat gaya tha
 The arrival time of the truck on the Delhi Mumbai route has reduced by ten hours
 iske kai kaaran he
 Still a large number of traders have not been registered
 bina registration ke transporter unka maal nahin uthaa saktaa kyonki pakadaa jayega
 The New Testament is like this
 phir bhi jinhone registration nahin karaayaa he, unka maal yahaan se vahaan ja to rahaa he
 How is it happening aise ho rahaa he ki iske liye jokhim uthaane vaale transporter dugana tiguna charge kar rahe hai
 At this time the government is not in a position to check
 lekin bahut badi sankhya main transporter chaahate hai ki registration vaale vyapaaree kaa hi maal uthaaen, magar jin logon ne registration karaayaa he unka bijness 40 se 50 fisadi kam ho gaya he
 The transporter is not getting orders from them
 isliye godaamon main trek badi sankhya main khaali khadey hai jo kisi bijness yaa arthvyavastha ke liye shubh sanket nahin he
 The downsizing of trucks has further impacted the trucks
 jaise dilli se jo trek maal kar dakshin kii taraf gaye hai, vahaan jaakar atak gaye hai
 Because the factories there are down production, trucks are not getting the goods
 isliye vaapasi kii jagah ve hafte bhar se dakshin ke shaharon main atake hai
 The transporter said that at least 1000 to 2000 trucks will be stuck in Delhi
 diwali ke sizan main aisa kabhi nahin hota tha
 This is just a matter of truck, if you include the trailer, small truck, tampo used in transport, then the picture will look something else
 hamane ye sabhi baaten baatcheet ke aadhaar par likhi hai jisase pataa chale ki zamin par kya ho rahaa he
 None of the traders said that they do not want to pay tax
 sab dena chaahate hai magar prakriya or karon kii dar se kaaphi pareshaan hai
 i spoke to representatives of some trade associations in Rajasthan over the phone
 rajasthan main marble, handi craft or gold jewelri kaa kaarobaar kaaphi ahm rakhata he
 The first has a GST of 28 per cent on both and 3 per cent GST on gold jewelery
 steel sangh ke seetaram agarwal sahab ne kaha ki hamaara bijness 40 percent down ho gaya he
 Sales of TMT bars, angles, panels have all been very low
 factriyon main jahaan teen shift chal rahi thi vahaan do shift chal rahi he
 The overtime earns less because the overtime is closed or less
 har sector main dihadi mazaduron ko kaam nahin mil rahaa he, sabase prabhavit yahi he
 As such, the steel sector accounts for 39 per cent of the banks' npas
 rajasthan main petrol or deazal kii khapat main saadhe chah fisadi kii kami aa gai he
 We give positive suggestions to the government, but there is no action
 sthaneey str par samasyaon kaa nidaan to band hi ho gaya he
 Similarly we talked to a businessman who made fancy items by carving stones from Jaipur
 naam na bataane kii shart par kaha ki unke bijness main 80 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Due to 28 per cent GST, things became so expensive that people stopped buying amateur
 pehle maheene kaa bijness pachaas se saath lakh kaa hota tha jo ab ghatakar das se 15 lakh par aa gaya he
 This has impacted employment
 unhone bataaya ki Those who were expensive and permanent accountants in our factory had to be removed
 aise kai logon kii chantni kii or unki jagah part time kaam liya
 There were three contractors, each with 10 to 15 laborers working
 pehle maheene hi do kantrector ko waapas bhej diya, ab bulaayaa he
 But now no contractor has more than two to three laborers, ie 10 to 12 laborers have been lost
 ham jiesti kii samasya ko portal tak hi simit na rakhen, iske kaaran vyapaar jo manda padaa he or dihadi par kamaane waalon ke haath se jo kaam chhina he, uskaa koi hisaab nahin he
 The arrival of a system and a three-taxed GST was welcomed like the midnight of 15 August 1947, due to the GST, those who have suffered injuries on their stomachs should not be called and honored in Parliament
 pichhali baar prime time main jab ham bank hadtaal par baat kar rahe the to ek awaz sunai di ki banking sector main naukariyaan kam ho gai hai
 Normally till this year the bank informs IBPS for the recruitment, this institution called Institute of Banking Personal Selection conducts the examination for the recruitment in the bank services
 ai bi pi es kii website se jo data mila he, use dekhte hai
 In 2015, advertisements for recruitment of 24, 604 clerks were released
 2016 main 19, 243 clerkon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa
 The recruitment of clerks decreased by 5,361 in one year
 2017 main 7,883 clerkon kii bhartee kii vekainsee ai he
 Between 2016 and 17, 11,360 posts were reduced
 2015 kii tulana main saulah hazaar vaikency kam ho gai he
 The young man stands in the desert of unemployment today and your leader is talking about the graveyard
 isse saaf saaf or isse zyaada kuch nahin kah saktaa
 Now comes the number of Probationer Officer P
O
 yahaan bhi kahani dukhad he
 In 2015, there were 12,434 posts of pos
 2016 main sidhaa 3612 kam ho kar 8,822 ho gaya
 In 2017, only 3,562 PO vacancies have come out
 yani 2015 kii tulana main 2017 main kareeb 9000 kam vekainsee ai he
 Today's Indian Express has published a report on Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana
 anchal magazine or anil sasi kii report aap bhi padhiyegaa
 The Ministry of Skill Development is reviewing demand and supply at the district level, collecting data
 july 2017 ke pehle hafte tak ke data ko dekhne ke baad jo tasviir saamne aa rahi he wo bhayaavah he
 The same shows why the media does not talk about employment, why Hindu talks about Muslim topics
 express kii is report main likhaa he kitippaniyan So far, under the skill development scheme, 30 lakh 67 thousand people have been trained or were being given
 inamen se maatr 2 lakh 90 hazaar ko hi kaam mila he
 There is a target of training one crore youth in four years under this scheme of 12,000 crores
 ab ye chintan ho rahaa he ki kahin training kii quality to ausat nahin he
 But was the quality so average that even out of 30 lakh three lakhs did not get employment, then what was right under this scheme? kya yah aankada daraane vaala nahin he, kya ab bhi aap naujavaanon ke bhavishya kii chintaa chhodkar hindu muslim taapic par bahes dekhnaa chahenge
 What to do, whether to riot the youth or to make them citizens
 hamaare desh main rojgaar ko lekar koi vishwasaneey or paardarshee data system nahin he
 App for so many things are made, an app would be made by it, which shows that this month which department of the center or which department of state governments have taken out jobs
 magar sarkarein nahin bataaengi kyonki aap hakeekat jaan jaaenge
 See the report of Sushil Mahapatra, what do the recycling factory say on the impact of GST

 Sitaram Agarwal Saheb of Steel Association said that our business has been down by 40%
 tiamati saria, angel, panel in sab kii bikri bahut hi kam rah gai he
 In factories where three shifts were going on, there are two shifts
 over time karne vaale kii kamai kam ho gai kyonki over time band he yaa kam he
 Daily laborers are not getting work in every sector, this is the most affected
 vaise bhi bainkon ke en pi e main 39 fisadi hissaa steel sector kaa hi he
 In Rajasthan, the consumption of petrol and diesel has come down by six and a half percent
 ham sarkaar ko positive suzav dete hai, magar koi ection nahin hota
 The diagnosis of problems at the local level has stopped
 isi tarah hamane jaipur ke pattharon ko taraash kar fansy item banane vaale ek kaarobaari se baat hui
 On the condition of anonymity, he said that his business has fallen by 80 percent
 28 fisadi jiesti ke kaaran chizein itani mahangi ho gayi ki logon ne shaukia kareed band kar di
 The business of the first month was from fifty to six lakhs, which has now come down to ten to 15 lakhs
 iskaa asar rojgaar par padaa he
 They told that hamaari factory main jo mahange or sthaayee acountint the unako hataanaa padaa
 Many such people were trimmed and replaced with part time work
 teen teen kantrector the, harek ke paas 10 se 15 mazdoor kaam kar rahe the
 Sent two contractors back in the first month, now called
 magar ab kisi kantrector ke paas do se teen mazaduron se zyada kaa kaam nahin he yani har kisi ke 10 se 12 mazaduron se kaam chhin gaya he
 Let us not confine the problem of GST to the portal, due to which the business has fallen and the work done by the daily earners is not accounted for
 ek pranali or teen tex vaali jiesti ke aagaman kaa swaagat 15 agast 1947 kii madhyaraatri kii tarah kiya gaya, jiesti ke kaaran jinke pet par chot padi he, kya unhen bulaakar sansad main sammanit nahin karnaa chahie
 Last time in prime time when we were talking about bank strike, a voice was heard saying that jobs in banking sector have reduced
 aam taur par is saal tak bank bhartiyon ke liye ai bi pi es ko bataa detii he,institute aaf banking personal salection naam kii yah sanstha bank sevaaon main bhartiyon ke liye pariksha yojit karti he
 Let's look at the data found from the IBPS website
 2015 main 24, 604 clerkon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 In 2016, an advertisement for the recruitment of 19,243 clerks came out
 ek saal main clerkon kii bhartee main 5,361 kii kami aa gai
 The recruitment of 7,883 clerks is vacant in 2017
 2016 se 17 ke bich 11,360 pad kam ho gaye
 Compared to 2015, 16,000 vacancies have decreased
 noujvaan aaj berojgaare ke registan main khadaa he or aapkaa netaa kabristaan kii baat kar rahaa he
 It cannot be said more clearly than this
 ab aate hai probationar afisar pio kii sankhya par
 The story here is also sad
 2015 main 12,434 post pio kaa niklaa tha
 In 2016, the direct 3612 was reduced to 8,822
 2017 main 3,562 pio kii hi vaikency nikali he
 That is, there are about 9000 less vacancies in 2017 as compared to 2015
 aaj ke hi indian express pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana par ek report chhapi he
 You will also read the reports of Anchal Magazine and Anil Sasi
 skill deveopment mantralay zila str par maang or aapurti kii samiksha kar rahaa he, data jamaa kar rahaa he
 After seeing the data up to the first week of July 2017, the picture coming out is horrifying
 usee se pataa chalata he ki kyon media rojgaar kii baat nahin karata, kyon hindu muslim taapic kii baat karata he
 This report of Express has written comments abhi tak kaushal vikaas yojana ke tahat 30 lakh 67 hazaar logon ko prashikshan diya gaya he yaa diya ja rahaa tha
 Out of these only 2 lakh 90 thousand have got work
 12,000 karod kii is yojana ke tahat chaar saal main ek karod yuvaaon ko training dene kaa lakshya he
 Now it is being thought that the quality of training is not average
 par kya quality itani ausat thi ki 30 lakh main se teen lakh ko bhi rojgaar nahin mila to phir is yojana ke tahat thik kya tha
 Isn't this figure intimidating, would you still like to leave a worry about the future of the youth and see the debate on Hindu Muslim topics
 karnaa kya he, naujavaanon ko dangai bananaa he yaa naagarik bananaa he
 There is no reliable and transparent data system for employment in our country
 itani chizon ke ap banate hai, ek ap isi kaa ban jaataa jisase yahi pataa chalata ki is maheene centre ke kis vibhaag ne yaa rajya sarkaron ke kis vibhaag ne naukariyaan nikaali hai
 But governments will not tell because you will know the reality
 susheel mahapatra kii report dekhie, jiesti ke asar par kya kehete hai ricycling factory vaale
 The condition of the transport sector has worsened since the introduction of GST
 july main to ghandha ghatakar 20 fisadi par aa gaya tha, agast main 50 fisadi tak aayaa
 60 percent reached in September but still 30-40 percent business down
 trakon ke phere ke samay main bhi khaas antar nahin aayaa he kyonki maharashtra ko chhod oktry har jagah se hat gaya tha
 The arrival time of the truck on the Delhi Mumbai route has reduced by ten hours
 iske kai kaaran he
 Still a large number of traders have not been registered
 bina registration ke transporter unka maal nahin uthaa saktaa kyonki pakadaa jayega
 The New Testament is like this
 phir bhi jinhone registration nahin karaayaa he, unka maal yahaan se vahaan ja to rahaa he
 How is it happening aise ho rahaa he ki iske liye jokhim uthaane vaale transporter dugana tiguna charge kar rahe hai
 At this time the government is not in a position to check
 lekin bahut badi sankhya main transporter chaahate hai ki registration vaale vyapaaree kaa hi maal uthaaen, magar jin logon ne registration karaayaa he unka bijness 40 se 50 fisadi kam ho gaya he
 The transporter is not getting orders from them
 isliye godaamon main trek badi sankhya main khaali khadey hai jo kisi bijness yaa arthvyavastha ke liye shubh sanket nahin he
 The downsizing of trucks has further impacted the trucks
 jaise dilli se jo trek maal kar dakshin kii taraf gaye hai, vahaan jaakar atak gaye hai
 Because the factories there are down production, trucks are not getting the goods
 isliye vaapasi kii jagah ve hafte bhar se dakshin ke shaharon main atake hai
 The transporter said that at least 1000 to 2000 trucks will be stuck in Delhi
 diwali ke sizan main aisa kabhi nahin hota tha
 This is just a matter of truck, if you include the trailer, small truck, tampo used in transport, then the picture will look something else
 hamane ye sabhi baaten baatcheet ke aadhaar par likhi hai jisase pataa chale ki zamin par kya ho rahaa he
 None of the traders said that they do not want to pay tax
 sab dena chaahate hai magar prakriya or karon kii dar se kaaphi pareshaan hai
 i spoke to representatives of some trade associations in Rajasthan over the phone
 rajasthan main marble, handi craft or gold jewelri kaa kaarobaar kaaphi ahm rakhata he
 The first has a GST of 28 per cent on both and 3 per cent GST on gold jewelery
 steel sangh ke seetaram agarwal sahab ne kaha ki hamaara bijness 40 percent down ho gaya he
 Sales of TMT bars, angles, panels have all been very low
 factriyon main jahaan teen shift chal rahi thi vahaan do shift chal rahi he
 The overtime earns less because the overtime is closed or less
 har sector main dihadi mazaduron ko kaam nahin mil rahaa he, sabase prabhavit yahi he
 As such, the steel sector accounts for 39 per cent of the banks' npas
 rajasthan main petrol or deazal kii khapat main saadhe chah fisadi kii kami aa gai he
 We give positive suggestions to the government, but there is no action
 sthaneey str par samasyaon kaa nidaan to band hi ho gaya he
 Similarly we talked to a businessman who made fancy items by carving stones from Jaipur
 naam na bataane kii shart par kaha ki unke bijness main 80 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Due to 28 per cent GST, things became so expensive that people stopped buying amateur
 pehle maheene kaa bijness pachaas se saath lakh kaa hota tha jo ab ghatakar das se 15 lakh par aa gaya he
 This has impacted employment
 unhone bataaya ki Those who were expensive and permanent accountants in our factory had to be removed
 aise kai logon kii chantni kii or unki jagah part time kaam liya
 There were three contractors, each with 10 to 15 laborers working
 pehle maheene hi do kantrector ko waapas bhej diya, ab bulaayaa he
 But now no contractor has more than two to three laborers, ie 10 to 12 laborers have been lost
 ham jiesti kii samasya ko portal tak hi simit na rakhen, iske kaaran vyapaar jo manda padaa he or dihadi par kamaane waalon ke haath se jo kaam chhina he, uskaa koi hisaab nahin he
 The arrival of a system and a three-taxed GST was welcomed like the midnight of 15 August 1947, due to the GST, those who have suffered injuries on their stomachs should not be called and honored in Parliament
 pichhali baar prime time main jab ham bank hadtaal par baat kar rahe the to ek awaz sunai di ki banking sector main naukariyaan kam ho gai hai
 Normally till this year the bank informs IBPS for the recruitment, this institution called Institute of Banking Personal Selection conducts the examination for the recruitment in the bank services
 ai bi pi es kii website se jo data mila he, use dekhte hai

 Today's Indian Express has published a report on Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana
 anchal magazine or anil sasi kii report aap bhi padhiyegaa
 The Ministry of Skill Development is reviewing demand and supply at the district level, collecting data
 july 2017 ke pehle hafte tak ke data ko dekhne ke baad jo tasviir saamne aa rahi he wo bhayaavah he
 The same shows why the media does not talk about employment, why Hindu talks about Muslim topics
 express kii is report main likhaa he kitippaniyan So far, under the skill development scheme, 30 lakh 67 thousand people have been trained or were being given
 inamen se maatr 2 lakh 90 hazaar ko hi kaam mila he
 There is a target of training one crore youth in four years under this scheme of 12,000 crores
 ab ye chintan ho rahaa he ki kahin training kii quality to ausat nahin he
 But was the quality so average that even out of 30 lakh three lakhs did not get employment, then what was right under this scheme? kya yah aankada daraane vaala nahin he, kya ab bhi aap naujavaanon ke bhavishya kii chintaa chhodkar hindu muslim taapic par bahes dekhnaa chahenge
 What to do, whether to riot the youth or to make them citizens
 hamaare desh main rojgaar ko lekar koi vishwasaneey or paardarshee data system nahin he
 App for so many things are made, an app would be made by it, which shows that this month which department of the center or which department of state governments have taken out jobs
 magar sarkarein nahin bataaengi kyonki aap hakeekat jaan jaaenge
 See the report of Sushil Mahapatra, what do the recycling factory say on the impact of GST

 Similarly we talked to a businessman who made fancy items by carving stones from Jaipur
 naam na bataane kii shart par kaha ki unke bijness main 80 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Due to 28 per cent GST, things became so expensive that people stopped buying amateur
 pehle maheene kaa bijness pachaas se saath lakh kaa hota tha jo ab ghatakar das se 15 lakh par aa gaya he
 This has impacted employment
 unhone bataaya ki Those who were expensive and permanent accountants in our factory had to be removed
 aise kai logon kii chantni kii or unki jagah part time kaam liya
 There were three contractors, each with 10 to 15 laborers working
 pehle maheene hi do kantrector ko waapas bhej diya, ab bulaayaa he
 But now no contractor has more than two to three laborers, ie 10 to 12 laborers have been lost
 ham jiesti kii samasya ko portal tak hi simit na rakhen, iske kaaran vyapaar jo manda padaa he or dihadi par kamaane waalon ke haath se jo kaam chhina he, uskaa koi hisaab nahin he
 The arrival of a system and a three-taxed GST was welcomed like the midnight of 15 August 1947, due to the GST, those who have suffered injuries on their stomachs should not be called and honored in Parliament
 pichhali baar prime time main jab ham bank hadtaal par baat kar rahe the to ek awaz sunai di ki banking sector main naukariyaan kam ho gai hai

 Today's Indian Express has published a report on Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana
 anchal magazine or anil sasi kii report aap bhi padhiyegaa
 The Ministry of Skill Development is reviewing demand and supply at the district level, collecting data
 july 2017 ke pehle hafte tak ke data ko dekhne ke baad jo tasviir saamne aa rahi he wo bhayaavah he
 The same shows why the media does not talk about employment, why Hindu talks about Muslim topics
 express kii is report main likhaa he kitippaniyan So far, under the skill development scheme, 30 lakh 67 thousand people have been trained or were being given
 inamen se maatr 2 lakh 90 hazaar ko hi kaam mila he
 There is a target of training one crore youth in four years under this scheme of 12,000 crores
 ab ye chintan ho rahaa he ki kahin training kii quality to ausat nahin he
 But was the quality so average that even out of 30 lakh three lakhs did not get employment, then what was right under this scheme? kya yah aankada daraane vaala nahin he, kya ab bhi aap naujavaanon ke bhavishya kii chintaa chhodkar hindu muslim taapic par bahes dekhnaa chahenge
 What to do, whether to riot the youth or to make them citizens
 hamaare desh main rojgaar ko lekar koi vishwasaneey or paardarshee data system nahin he
 App for so many things are made, an app would be made by it, which shows that this month which department of the center or which department of state governments have taken out jobs

 See the report of Sushil Mahapatra, what do the recycling factory say on the impact of GST

 Let us not confine the problem of GST to the portal, due to which the business has fallen and the work done by the daily earners is not accounted for

 The recruitment of 7,883 clerks is vacant in 2017
 2016 se 17 ke bich 11,360 pad kam ho gaye
 Compared to 2015, 16,000 vacancies have decreased

 It cannot be said more clearly than this
 ab aate hai probationar afisar pio kii sankhya par
 The story here is also sad

 In 2016, the direct 3612 was reduced to 8,822
 2017 main 3,562 pio kii hi vaikency nikali he

 Singarasonu Nigam participated in the 8th season of Safdigiri Award 2018
 is satr kaa sanchaalan shweta singh ne kiya
 During this, Sonu attacked the garbage spreaders
 sonu nigam ne kaha "gandagi rokane ke liye tourist place par camere lage hone chahie
 The trash can be imprisoned for one day
 phir chaahe aap gujarat se aae hon yaa maharashtra se
 Jail for one day for throwing garbage directly
 jab ham videsh jate hai to iskaa dhyaan rakhte hai, kyonki vahaan fine lagata he
 "sonu Nigam shared an incident saying," i had a show in Ladakh recently
 is dauraan hamen itibipi ke javaanon ne bharpoor pyaar diya
 We stayed there in the camp
 jab ham pangong lake gaye to maine vahaan kaaphi gandagi dekhi
 When i asked the soldiers, what is all this? He said- Sonu, we clean people
 ye itibipi ke jawan kah rahe hai
 They are our soldiers and you are getting them done
 kaise himmat hui aapaki
 They work in a temperature in which the ribs of the hands are broken
 "sonu ne kaha, "ham kitne bhi toilet bana den, lekin jab tak inkaa istemaal karnaa nahin aayega, kuch nahin hone vaala
 People do not clean hands after cleaning their nose
 mere se haath milaate hai to mujhe lagata he ki isane pataa nahin apane haathon kaa kahaan-kahaan istemaal kiya hoga
 If i do not join hands, people will say that i am an aerogent

 Surat Police has announced this

 Narayan's wife is not far behind in this matter
 surat police ke saman ke baad narayan sai ki patni janaki somvaar ko indore se surat pahunchi or surat police ke samaksh apane bayaan darj karavaaya
 With the recording of his wife's statement, the possibility of many more revelations of Narayan Sai's character and his personal business has increased
 haalanki sai or uski patni ke bich talaak kaa maamla court main chal rahaa hai
 In such a situation, it will also have to be seen that how much correct information will be obtained from his statement

 But he is being questioned about the case registered
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki police sai kii patni janaki ko maamle main gavaah banaaegi
 On the other hand, after questioning, Janaki refused to speak against Narayan
 lekin uske vakil ne kaha ki surat police ke saman ke aadhaar par poochtacha ke liye janaki ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 He has not given information about Narayana's property but has definitely given information about the crimes of Narayan

 The court was hearing the petition of the alleged middleman Christian Mitchell arrested in the case
 mishael ne is maamle main mani londring se jude dastavejon ke li hone kii jaanch kii maang kii thi
 Mitchell accused the ED of politicizing the case by giving documents to the media
 haalanki idi ne patrakaron ko kisi bhi tarah ke dastavej saunpe jane ke aaropon ko khaarij kiya or ek stats report daayar kar daawa kiya ki uski taraf se aarope-patr li hua hi nahin he
 The ED said that it is very possible that the media got information from the court's additional copy of the charge sheet left
 vahiin court staff ne idi se chargeshit kii atirikt copy praapt hone se inkaar kiya he
 The court said in its order that the status report filed by the ED was not 'trustworthy'
 adaalat ke mutabik usne idi ko aisa koi nirdesh nahin diya tha ki vah koi extra copy de, na hi idi ne kaha tha ki usne koi atirikt prati jamaa karai he
 The court has said that even if the ed's claim is accepted, leaving a copy of the supplementary charge sheet to the court staff is a pattern of negligence
 adaalat ne kaha, "idi dwaara lagaae gaye aarope pehle to galat dikhaai padate hai, ED ke varjan par yakeen nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 "however, the court refused to think deeply about the issue whether the journalists received the charge sheet negligently or it was a deliberate move

 But this aspect cannot be ignored that the AAP brought those questions to the center of politics for a long time
 isamen 'mango pipal' se jude mudde to the hi, raajnneetik paardarshita or viipi culture ke khilaaf sakht rukh bhi tha
 The claim was of Swaraj and corruption-free governance and the face was Arvind Kejriwalka of honest image
 nateeja 8 disambar 2013 ko jab dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aae, to saare akalan dhwast ho gaye
 The one year old party had won 28 seats
 dilli kii sadakon par jhaadu laharaa rahi thi
 When Arvind Kejriwal took oath as Chief Minister in front of the public, the politics of India felt a different kind of political force
 shapath grahan main 'insaan kaa insaan se ho bhaichara' gaata mukhyamantri, bharat ne pehle nahin dekha tha
 This was the strength of the common man
 ye aam aadmi party kii pehali or sabase badi jeet thi
 Former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is once again preparing to gain power in Delhi
 apane pehle chamatkaar ko dohraane kii ranneeti par kaam chal rahaa he
 However, will this example be able to survive? kya aam aadmi party ek baar phir apni jeet ko doharaa sakegi? kya kejariwal dilli kii siyasat ke sabase bade superman sabit honge? in sawaalon kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye thodaa flash back main chalanaa hoga
 The series started from where
 
 
 26 november 2012
 This is the date when the journey of the Aam Aadmi Party started with the passion of nationalism and improving the life of the common man
 bhrashtachar kii zanjeeron main jakadte ja rahe desh ko bachaane ke liye sadak se lekar sarkari daftaron tak rozmarra ke chote-bade karpshan se jang ladati janata
 The dream of freeing the entire country from the trap of corruption by the Lokpal
 to yahaan se shuru hua tha yah safar
 From the Jan Lokpal movement to the Aam Aadmi Party and from the first election to the regaining of Delhi
 ye siyaasi safar kisi sapane ke sach hone jaisaa he
 But, this dream was broken many times, then it started to disintegrate in many ways
 dilli samet puure desh kii raajnneeti main ek nai tarah kii siyasat shuru karne vaali party kaa har pahalu kaaphi dilachasp he
 On the occasion of Foundation Day, Foundation Day, tell you the whole story of the foundation of the Aam Aadmi Party from its reach to its height
 anna kaa arjuna, kejarivashravind kejariwal or anna hajaare
 One former bureaucrat and the other a powerful agitator
 ek dronacharya to doosraa unka arjuna
 Together, both of them made a political weapon on such an issue, which targeted all the parties of the country
 karpshan ke kilaaf ladaai hi aam aadmi party kii buniyaad he
 However, no one knew that the end of the agitation would emerge as a political party and Anna and VK Singh (now ministers in the NDA government) and Santosh would be separated from Kejriwal with the Indian
 aam aadmi party kii neenv to usee din taiyaar hone lagi thi, jab agast 2011 main jantar-mantar par anna or kejariwal samet unki puri team ne andolan shuru kiya tha
 India Against Corruption, the fight of the people of India against corruption
 isi andolan ko lekar anna ke saath kejariwal, kiran bedi, prashanth bhushan, shanti bhushan jaise apane-apane kshetra kii mashhoor hastiyaan ek manch par ain
 Anna was just a supporter of the movement
 anshan unki sabase badi taaqat he, isliye wo shuru se sirf andolan ke dam par apni maangen manwaane kii koshish kar rahe the
 (read on the following pages, what Kejriwal argued to get into politics
 )'keechad main jaae bina safai kaise hogi'janalokapal andolan ko lekar jantar-mantar se shuru hua andolan dilli ke ramlila maidan tak pahunchaa
 The then UPA government clashed several times over the issue of Jan Lokpal legislation
 upie sarkaar ne us vakt tamaam vaade kiye, lekin har baar anna or unke saathiyon ko laga ki janata ke saath dhokhaa ho rahaa he
 The BJP itself and Narendra Modi were with this movement
 baharhaal, janalokapal bill to nahin paas hua, lekin kejariwal or anna kii raahen alag hone kii neenv taiyaar ho gai
 There was an argument that politics should not go in the mud
 par javaabi tark tha ki keechad main ghuse bina safai kaise hogi
 Then there was the challenge of leaders like Digvijay Singh to 'come and show in politics'
 lihaaja kejariwal ne ek saahasik faisla liya
 He created a masterplan on the basis of all modern means of publicity, including social networking sites
 janalokapal andolan shuru hone ke kareeb ek saal baad oktober 2012 main anna kii jagahkejariwal ne janalokapal ko lekar anshan shuru kiya
 The then UPA government did not care about Kejriwal's fast
 kejariwal ne kaha ki raajnneetik system kaa hissaa banakar hi janata ko unka haq dilaayaa ja saktaa he
 If the Jan Lokpal bill is to be brought, then a political party has to be formed for it
 anna iske bilkul khilaaf the
 Thousands of people were sitting in Delhi's Ramlila Maidan in front of Kejriwal
 anna se alag hokar party banane kaa faisla unhen lenaa hi padaa
 On 2 October 2012, Kejriwal announced to form a party from the stage of fasting
 party ke gathan kii taarikh tay hui, 26 november
 Because, this was the day the Constitution was adopted in 1949
 antat: alag hue anna26 november 2012 ko anna or kejariwal ke raste hameshaa ke liye alag ho gaye
 Anna India started on the path of continuing its war on the strength of Against Corruption
 vahi india against karpshan jiske fasebuk pej ne bhi vichaaron ke str par teji se palati maari or jab khule taur par bijepi ke paksh main or AAP ke khilaaf content post karata he
 Well, Kejriwal formed the party and plunged into the power struggle
 unhone soshal media se lekar prachaar ke tamaam madhyamon ke zarie party ke liye naam kaa suzav maanga
 Delhiites named the Aam Aadmi Party after seeing the common man on Kejriwal's cap
 sabko ye naam behatar laga or 26 november 2012 ko ban gai ek nai party
 Aam Aadmi Party
 cheharaa bane arvind kejariwal
 Now Kejriwal had many challenges
 ek saal baad hone vaale dilli vidhansabha ke chunaav main apana vajood sabit karnaa
 
 or usase pehle dilli kii janata kaa dil jeetna
 Both these things were not easy
 aam aadmi party or kejariwal kaa pehla chunaav tha
 In 2012, the party was formed and in 2013 the party was struggling to make a place in the Delhi elections
 kejariwal kii raajnneeti ko congress, bijepi samet sabhi partiyon ne shuruaati taur par khaarij karne kii koshish kii
 Opposition parties started saying that in the same election, the Aam Aadmi Party and their leaders will get to know the difficulties of politics
 
 The party will end after the first election
 (aage ke pannon par padhein: chunaav nattejey kaa vah aitihaasik din)or 8 disambar 2013 kaa vah din
 
 
 The 2013 Delhi Assembly election was a litmus test for Kejriwal and his political colleagues
 party ne dilli kii sabhi 70 siton par chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 But in the meantime, Kejriwal took another major decision
 unhone nai dilli seat se ladane kaa elaan kiya
 Sheela Dixit, the then Chief Minister of Delhi and who has been in the seat for 15 years, was fighting on this seat
 logon ko laga ki kejariwal ne badi raajnneetik bhul kar di he
 However, he stood firm on his decision and kept all the allegations of corruption during the Sheela government as part of the political campaign
 jab chunaav ke nattejey aae, to dilli kii siyasat puri tarah badal gai
 Kejriwal was defeated by Chief Minister Sheila Dixit badly from the New Delhi seat and the ruling Congress came third with 8 seats
 15 saal kaa congress kaa shashan nai naveli party ne khatm kar diya
 All the damage done to the Congress was due to the Aam Aadmi Party
 congress ke netaa zyaadaatar siton par tisare paaydaan par chale gaye
 The Congress suffered a crushing defeat and the BJP too fell behind by a majority of four seats
 sasti bijli or muft pani ke saath-saath bhrashtachar mukt dilli banane kaa vaada kaam kar gaya
 The Aam Aadmi Party got 28 seats
 dilli ke siyaasi itihaas main aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua
 Only one year old party never got 28 seats in the first election
 congress kaa bahari samarthan or vivadkejariwal or unke saathiyon ke liye ye jashn kaa vakt tha
 Because, despite being the largest party, the BJP refused to form the government and the Congress could not form the government under any circumstances
 bijepi ko rokane ke liye congress ne uparajyapal ko chitthee likhi, ki agar aam aadmi party sarkaar banaati he to congress use bina shart samarthan ko taiyaar he
 'aam Aadmi Party is afraid to form government due to lack of experience of governance', some such statements came
 AAP ne sarkaar banane kaa faisla kiya
 Kejriwal appealed to every party MLA in the Assembly to support the motion of confidence
 bijepi ko saath nahin dena tha, lekin congress ke aathon vidhayakon or jediu ke ekmaatr vidhayak ne AAP ke paksh main vot kiya or sarkaar ko bahumat mil gaya
 Those who were rejecting Kejriwal, they kept seeing him in the Ramlila Maidan
 28 disambar 2013 ko kejariwal ne congress ke samarthan se sarkaar banaai
 Kejriwal kept the promise of cheap electricity and free water while on the chair of the Chief Minister of Delhi
 logon ko karpshan se mukti dilaane ke liye sting oparation kii salaah di, helpline shuru kii or har shikaayat par fouran karrwai kaa vaada kiya
 Made some fast-paced decisions in a non-traditional political style
 iske baad aam aadmi party ne janalokapal bill ko paas karwaane kaa faisla kiya
 This is the issue on which Kejriwal decided the journey from agitation to power
 14 farvari 2014 ko kejariwal ne vidhansabha main kah diya ki agar lokapal bill par charchaa nahin hone di jaaegi to wo istipha de denge
 This is what Kejriwal left the chair
 janalokapal bill par na congress ne saath diya, na bijepi ne
 Kejriwal did not think it appropriate to remain in power because he could not fulfill his promise
 baari hangaame ke bich kejariwal ne tay faisle ke mutabik istipha dene kaa elaan kar diya
 He held the BJP and the Congress responsible for this
 magar, virodhiyon ne kaha ki wo siem se sidhe piem banane kaa sapana puraa karne ke liye satta chhodkar bhaag gaye
 Kejriwal still has to clarify on this issue
 kejariwal ne satta chhodane ke baad narendra modi ke kilaaf varanasi se loksabhaa kaa chunaav bhi ladaa
 However, they were defeated
 loksabhaa chunaav main aam aadmi party ko apekshit safalataa nahin mili, lekin punjab se unhen chaar saansad jarur mili
 AAP once again became active in the politics of Delhi
 maharashtra or haryana kaa chunaav bhi isiilie nahin ladaa, taaki dilli tak hi simit rahen
 However, since the formation of the party, many people have separated from them
 shazia ilmi samet party ke kai charchit chehre ek-ek karke kejariwal se dur ho chuke hai
 Among those who got away, the closeness of many of them increased in later days with BJP
 ab ek baar phir kejariwal ne nai dilli se chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 After the big defeat in the Lok Sabha elections after the Delhi Assembly elections, the path of the return of the Aam Aadmi Party to the politics of the capital is not as easy as it was before
 ek saal main yahaan kii raajnneetik hawa main kaafii badlaav aayaa he
 Now Kejriwal will have to undergo a major fire test

 Super-30 founder Anand Kumar has been accused of fraud by his own students
 chaatro ne aarope lagaaya he ki apni lokapriyata ko badhaane ke liye anand kumaar ne jaalsaji or fareb kaa sahaara liya he
 The students allege that this year, in the IIT JEE examination, Anand Kumar announced that out of the 30 students studying in his institution, 26 passed this examination, but the truth is that this time only 3 students from Anand Kumar's institute are iits
 Passed JEE exam
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki iaiti jeii advance pariksha ke nattejey ghoshit hone ke baad anand kumaar ne elaan kiya ki unke yahaan padhane vaale 30 bacchon main se 26 main yah pariksha paas kii he, jisamen se onorjit goswami, suraj kumaar, yash kumaar or sooryakanth shaamil he jabaki hakeekat yah he ki in 26 chaatro main se kai chaatr kabhi bhi super-30 kaa hissaa rahe hi nahin
 Now you too can take admission in Super-30, instead it is alleged that a student named Niyamgagan, Suraj Kumar, who has passed the IIT JEE Advanced Exam, has studied at a coaching institute in Kota, Rajasthan, but when IIT-JEE When the results of the examination were declared, Anand Kumar presented Suraj Kumar to the media stating that he was a student of Super-30

 gagan ne bataaya ki is saal jin 26 bacchon ko anand kumaar ne iaiti jeii pariksha main safal bataaya unamem se keval onorjit goswami super-30 kaa chaatr tha
 Know - What is 'kashmir Super 30', students will get these facilities? According to local newspapers, in view of the popularity of Super-30, many aspiring students from all over the country reached Patna to enroll in iits, so that they could join Super-30
 But after coming to Patna, Anand Kumar used to ask all these students to enroll in another coaching institute Ramanuj Classes first
 is koching sanstha main daakhila lene kii fees takreeban 33040 rupee thi
 According to local newspapers, Anand Kumar earlier used to ask all these students to enroll in Ramanuj classes and assured them that only students who performed well in this coaching institute would be selected for Super-30
 anand kumaar ke upar aarope he ki is tareeke kii jaalsaji karke vah salanaa takreeban ek karod se zyada rupye kamaate the
 Significantly, Super-30 was started by Anand Kumar in 2002 where coaching was provided free of cost to poor students seeking admission to IIT, a prestigious engineering institute
 pichley kai saalon main super-30 ne safalataa ke kai jhande gaade hai jisko lekar anand kumaar kaa desh or videsh main kaaphi naam hua he

 Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju has rejected the allegations of growing intolerance in the country
 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main unhone kaha ki desh main ashishnutaa nahin badi he, balki congress ashishnu ho gai he
 He said that in fact the Congress party is unable to see any other party in central power
 darshakon ke sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue rigiju ne kaha ki mandiron or dargahon main mahilaon ke saath kiya jane vaala bhedbhaav galat he
 The religious leaders should discuss this side
 samvidhan mempurush or mahiladonon ko barabari kaa darja diya gaya he, vahiin arvind kejariwal ke bare main baat karte hue kendriya mantri ne kaha ki dilli ke mukhyamantri khud kah chuke hai ki vah arajak hai, samvidhan ko nahin maanate aise main unke munh laganaa thik nahin he
 Question: In cases like Dalit massacre or Dadri, politicians reach, but nobody goes to the martyrs' house in Pathankot? Rijiju: If political parties like Congress and Aam Aadmi Party join the Pathankot incident, they do not get votes
 jati kii raajnneeti ne hindustan ko nonch-nonch kar khaaya he
 Congress and communist people do not want to leave it
 desh main kisi kii jati yaa dharm ke naam par bhedbhaav nahin hona chahie
 But when political color is given to it, then the subject itself changes
 congress ko jawaab dena chahie ki usne ab tak daliton ke liye kya kiya he
 Question: In the last few years, Naxalite activities are increasing in the educational institutions of the country, what is the Home Ministry doing for it? Rijiju: Educational institutions come under the HRD Ministry
 ajukeshan rajya kaa vishay he
 As is the case with FTTI, the central government has the right to appoint a chairman
 ab jab aisa kiya gaya to raajnneetik rang diya jaataa he ki aap aisa nahin kar sakate
 The issue changes as politics gives color
 chaatr bhi vahaan virodh kar rahe the, lekin ye bataaie ki kya chaatro ke kehane par principal niyukt kiya jayega
 Question: Is India intolerant? Rijiju: Absolutely not
 desh ko ashishnu congress waalon ne banaaya he
 The Congress ruled so long that it could not bear to see anyone else in power
 desh ne hamen bahumat diya
 The Congress should understand this, but it is intolerant from day one
 sawaal: lekin jo filmstars kah rahe hai, unka kya?rigiju: ye motivated he
 i am not taking anyone's name
 lekin agar koi kisi se koi bayaan dilwaataa he to usase desh kaa man nahin badalane vaala he
 Apart from Aamir Khan or even Shah Rukh Khan, many people have said that there is no non-violence in the country
 sawaal: mahila suraksha ko lekar sarkaar ke paas kya blueprint he?rigiju: yah bahut gambhir maamla he
 There are two aspects to this
 ek sarkaar kya kadam uthaa rahi he, doosraa saamaajik str par ham kya soch rakhte hai
 If the woman is not safe at home, what would you call it? ghar ke andar mahilaon se rape ho rahaa he
 Police action is necessary, but work is necessary to prevent incidents at the social level
 is ore awarenes failaane kii jarurat he
 The Registration of Crime Against Woman has increased since last year
 hamane sunishchit kiya he ki agar mahilaon ke khilaaf koi ghatana hoti he to usko daakhil karnaa hi he or karrwai kerani hi he
 Question: Nirbhaya centers and what would you like to say about the fund? Rijiju: We have done a lot of work on awareness
 nirbhaya fund ko ham bahut bade str par shuru karne vaale hai
 Whether it is to work at the state government level, we are fully cooperating
 dilli police ko dekh lijie, mahilaon ko lekar training, awarenes ke kaarykram chalaya ja rahe hai
 Yes, a lot needs to be done on this side right now and we are doing it
 sawaal: mandiron or dargahon main mahilaon ko lekar bhedbhaav par aap kya kahana chahenge?rigiju: hamaara desh samvidhan se chalata he
 Women and men have equal status in the constitution
 kuch mandiron or dharmik jagahon ne jo apana system banaaya he, ab hamane har jagah jaakar system ke peeche check nahin kiya he
 This is what we say should not be discriminated against
 main sanvaidhanik pad par baitha hum or yahi kahana chaahunga
 There should also be a discussion among the religious leaders that there should be no discrimination against women
 sawaal: nirbhaya hatyakand jaisi ghatana dobaaraa nahin hogi, isaki kya guarantee he?rigiju: hamaare kamitment main koi kami nahin hogi, isaki guarantee ham dete hai
 Question: There is fear in the minds of people, Delhi Police is involved in politics
 ganatantr diwas aata he to suraksha kadi ho jaati he?rigiju: sirf dilli police kii baat nahin he
 It is a matter of awareness everywhere in the society
 aisa nahin he ki sirf viipi kii suraksha hamaare liye myne rakhata he
 It has changed in today's times as it used to manage security
 police ke kaamkaaj kaa tarika bhi badla he
 Just leaving everything to the police will not do
 ab internet or mobile kaa jamaana he
 There are new types of challenges
 sawaal: dilli police par kejariwal kii jo jid he, use kaise handle karenge?rigiju: kejariwal ji ke bare main mujhase zyada sawaal mat kiijie
 He is a educated man
 main jab unase mila to milane se to bahut achche hai
 They also do good behavior, but when they go out in television and start speaking, then they think how can they talk wrong
 dekhne main to bhole bhaale hai
 He himself has said that he is anarchic, does not follow the law
 samvidhan ko nahin maanate hai
 He himself has said, his mouth is not right
 ham unako izzat dete hai, lekin unako bhi apane pad kii garima rakhni chahie
 He abuses his own officer
 vah shashan nahin chalaa sakate to pradhanmantri ji kaa naam lete hai
 While PM Modi continues to work all day
 yah desh kaa saubhaahgya he ki desh ko aisa pradhanmantri mila he
 But to weaken them, people like Arvind talk around the world
 sawaal: tirangaa fahraane par, rashtragon sikhaane par desh main kai jagahon par bheed ugr ho jaati he
 Rijiju: What is the government doing for this? Rijiju: When we are sitting in the Ministry of Home Affairs, we get thousands of reports every morning that this happened here, there it happened
 ham har jagah karrwai nahin kar sakate hai
 We see the big issues that are national security
 jo choti ghatnaayen hai, unke liye local agency jo local state he vah karrwai karata he or ham report lete hai
 Question: Not only terrorism, violence is also a problem, if Subramanian Swamy raises the issue of Ram temple, will it not provoke a riot? Rijiju: There should be freedom to speak in such a big country
 koi agar kuch bol rahaa he to usko kaise roak sakate hai
 But everyone has the right to express his desire by keeping it within the purview of law in a normal way
 jahaan tak ram mandir kaa sawaal he to yah isko lekar court main cese chal rahaa he

 But instead of finding a concrete solution to this, the government is blaming the Congress to Telugu Desam Party for this
 nishane par ab media bhi he

 If you too have a similar complaint, then consider your behavior before calling your husband good and bad
 ho saktaa he ki aapaki hi kuch aadaton kii vajah se wo aapse dur ho gaye hon
 1- Somewhere you do not compare your partner with your X
 
 
 ?ateet ko bhulaakar sabhi ko aage badhanaa padataa he
 If your behavior is not good for your partner then they will obviously start hating you
 kisi ko pasand nahin hoga ki uski tulana kisi duusare shaks se kii jaae
 2
 kya aap apane partner ko samay nahin detinmana ki aapke paas ghar ke sau kaam hote hai or aapke liesmay nikaal paanaa mushkil hota helekin ek samay ke baad aapke partner ko aapaki tavajjo chahie hoti he
 In such a situation, you may feel bad about being chopped all the time and being busy with other tasks
 3
 When the intimacy between the two of you remains only to show, no man wants that he should get love as a favor
 agar aap apane partner ke kareeb hokar bhi kareeb nahin he to ye aapke rishte ko bigaad saktaa he
 In such a situation, when you are with them, nothing else is going on in your mind
 4
 Everybody needs a support, not to pay attention to the partner's career
 lekin agar aasapane pati ke liye saportive nahin hanto ek samay ke baad aap donon ke bich daraar pad sakati he
 They may just stop sharing their things with you
 5
 Never stop paying attention to yourself
 Remember when this relationship started, how much you used to live
 to ab kyon nahin
 
 
 Your husband will always like to be groomed
 aise main ghar ke kaamon se vakt nikaalkar kuch samay khud ko bhi dijie

 kahin aap bevajaah shaq to nahin karatinho saktaa he kai baar unhonen aapkaa bharosa todaa ho lekin baat-baat par shaq karnaa sahi nahin he

 sena pramukh ko chintaa kyon he ki bijepi kii tulana main loktantric or dharmanirpeksh mulyon par aadhaarit ek raajnneetik party teji se bad rahi he? unhone kaha ki badi raajnneetik partiyon ke galat ravaie kii vajah se AIUDF or AAP jaisi vaikalpik partiyaan teji se aage badi hai
 The comments unhone kaha ki is tarah kaa bayaan dekar sena pramukh kya khud ko raajnneeti main shaamil nahin kar rahe hai? jo ki samvidhan ke khilaaf he
 Ajmal has spoken on the issue by tweeting
 unhone ek twit main kaha ki sena pramukh bipin ravat ne ek raajnneetik bayaan diya he, jo chaunkaane vaala he
 Why is the army chief worried that a political party based on democratic and secular values is growing faster than the BJP? He said that alternative parties like AIUDF and AAP have moved forward rapidly due to the wrong attitude of big political parties
 tippaniyan He said that by making such a statement, are the army chiefs not involving themselves in politics? Which is against the constitution
 unhone kaha ki is tarah kaa bayaan dekar sena pramukh kya khud ko raajnneeti main shaamil nahin kar rahe hai? jo ki samvidhan ke khilaaf he

 Indian Space Agency ISRO has described the difficulties of the Chandrayaan-2 mission
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki bhartiya vaigyanik chandrayan-2 ko launch karne ke baad use chand par land karaane tak kis tarah kii samasyaon se rubaru hone vaale hai
 However, scientists have expressed confidence that they will meet all these challenges
 chandrayan-2 ko 9 se 16 july ke bich choda jayega
 Seven challenges will come in front of the first challenge in the journey of Chandrayaan-2: The distance of the moon from the Earth will be about 3 lakh 84 thousand 400 km at the time of taking the right path
 itane lambey safar ke liye sabase jaruri sahi maarg (tregectory) kaa chunaav karnaa
 Because with the right trajectory, Chandrayaan-2 will have less impact on the gravity of the earth, moon and other objects coming in the way, solar radiation and the movement of the moon
 duusari chunauteeh gahare antariksh main sanchardharti se zyada duuri hone kii vajah se radio signal deree se pahunchenge
 Delayed reply
 saath hi antariksh main hone vaali aawaaj bhi sanchaar main baadha pahuchaanenge
 Third challenge: Reaching the moon's orbit Chandrayaan-2 will not be easy to reach the moon's orbit
 lagaataar badalte orbital movement kii vajah se chandrayan-2 ko chand kii kaksha main pahunchane ke liye atyadhik sateekta kii jarurat hogi
 It will cost a lot of fuel
 sahi kaksha main pahunchane par hi tay jagah par landing ho paaegi
 Fourth challenge: Walking in the moon's orbit It will not be easy for Chandrayaan-2 to revolve around the moon
 iskaa bada kaaran he chand ke chaaron taraf gravity baraabar nahin he
 This affects the electronics of Chandrayaan-2
 isliye, chand kii gravity or vaataavaran kii bhi baariki se gananaa kerani hogi
 Fifth Challenge: Soft Landing on the Moon According to ISRO scientists, the biggest challenge is the soft landing of the rover and lander on the Moon to Chandrayaan-2
 chand kii kaksha se dakshini dhruv par rover or lander ko aaraam se utaarne ke liye propalshan system or onboard computer kaa kaam mukhya hoga
 All these works will be done automatically
 chhathin chunauteeh chandramaa kii dhulchand kii sataha par dheron gadde, pathar or dhul he
 As soon as the lander turns on its propulsion system on the lunar surface, there will be rapid dust blowing
 dhul udakar lander ke solar panel par jamaa ho sakati he, isse power supplai baadhit ho sakati he
 Onboard computer sensors may be affected
 saatvin chunauteeh badalata tapamaanachaand kaa ek din yaa raat dharti ke 14 din ke baraabar hoti he
 Because of this, the temperature on the lunar surface changes rapidly
 isse lander or rover ke kaam main baadha aegi

 com / mpmyc6vpgn — ISRO (@isro) June 3, 2019 All payloads in Chandrayaan-2 are indigenous, Chandrayaan-2 does not have a single payload overseas
 iske sabhi hisse puri tarah se swadeshi hai, jabaki, chandrayan-1 ke orbitor main 3 europe or 2 america ke pelods the
 After 11 years, the Indian Space Agency ISRO is ready to explore the lunar surface once again
 dakshini dhruv ke paas utrega chandrayan-2isro ne ummid jataai he ki chandrayan-2 chandramaa par 6 sitambar ko dakshini dhruv ke paas utrega
 Chandrayaan-2 has three parts, named Orbiter, Lander (vikram) and Rover (pragya)
 is project kii laagat 800 karod rupye he
 Between 9 and 16 July, the distance of the Moon from Earth will be 384400 kilometers
 agar mishan safal hua to america, rus, china ke baad bharat chand par rover utaarne vaala chauthaa desh hoga
 The most powerful rocket will be launched from GSLV Mark-3, Chandrayaan-2 will be released outside the Earth's orbit from isro's strongest rocket GSLV Mark-3
 phir use chand kii kaksha main pahunchaaya jayega
 Chandrayaan-2 will reach the moon's orbit after about 55 days
 phir lander chand kii sataha par utrega
 After this the rover will come out of it and do various experiments
 chand kii sataha, vaataavaran or mitti kii jaanch karegaa
 At the same time, the orbiter will keep an eye on the lander and rover circling around the moon
 saath hi, rover se mili jaankaree ko isro centre bhejega
 Mission How many days Orbiter - 1 year, Lander (vikram) - 15 days, Rover (pragya) - 15 days Total weight of mission: 3877 kg Orbiter - 2379 kg, Lander (vikram) - 1471 kg, Rover (pragyan) - 27 kg Orbiter: 100 km from Moon
 The isro's mobile command center Chandrayaan-2's orbiter will send the information received from the lander and rover to ISRO center, orbiting 100 km above the moon
 isamen 8 pelod hai
 Also, the command sent from ISRO to the lander and rover
 ise hindustan aironautics limited ne banaakar 2015 main hi isro ko saunp diya tha
 Vikram Lander: ISRO built indigenous Landerlander on Russia's refusal, named after ISRO founder and father of Indian space program Vikram Sarabhai
 isamen 4 pelod hai
 It will carry out scientific experiments for 15 days
 isaki shuruaati dizin isro ke spes aplicoshan centre ahmedabad ne banaaya tha
 Later it was developed by the URSC of Bengaluru
 pragyan roverh is robot ke kandhe par puraa mishan, 15 minute main milegaa data27 kilo ke is robot par hi puure mishan kii jimmdari he
 It has 2 payloads
 chand kii sataha par yah kareeb 400 meter kii duuri tay karegaa
 During this time it will conduct various scientific experiments
 phir chand se praapt jaankaree ko vikram lander par bhejega
 The lander will send data to the orbiter from there
 phir orbitor use isro centre par bhejega
 This entire process will take about 15 minutes
 yani pragyan se bheji gai jaankaree dharti tak aane main 15 minute lagenge
 Why it took 11 years for the launch of Chandrayaan-2 In November 2007, the Russian space agency Rosskosmos said that it would work together in this project
 vah isro ko lander degaa
 In 2008, the mission received approval from the government
 2009 main chandrayan-2 kaa dizin taiyaar kar liya gaya
 The launch was scheduled in January 2013, but the Russian space agency rosscosmos lander could not deliver
 phir isaki lonching 2016 main tay kii gai
 However, in 2015, Rosskosmos withdrew from the project
 phir
 
 
 ISRO made its own indigenous lander, roverissero, decided to launch Chandrayaan-2 in March 2018
 lekin kuch test ke liye lonching ko april 2018 or phir oktober 2018 tak taala gaya
 Meanwhile, in June 2018, ISRO decided that the launch of Chandrayaan-2 was decided by January 2019, by making some necessary changes
 phir ise farvari 2019 kiya gaya
 The news of the launch was also reported in April 2019, but not done
 chandrayan-1
 
 
 When ISRO touched the moon for the first time, India launched Chandrayaan-1, its first mission to the moon, in 2008
 392 din kaam karne ke baad eendhan kii kami se mishan 29 agast 2009 ko khatm ho gaya
 During this time, Chandrayaan-1 made 3400 rounds of the moon
 abhi tak chand par soft landing karaane vaale desh america, rus or china hi hai
 Chandrayaan-1 also collected evidence of water on the moon

 During this time 4 MNS workers were also injured
 marpet raaj kundra ke nae sho 'super fite lig' ko lekar shuru hui
 According to the police, the whole controversy started with Raj Kundra's new show
 haalanki police abhi party ke naam kaa khulaasa nahin kar rahi he
 Earlier around 8 o'clock in the night, the MNS workers were forcibly entering the studio, but the security personnel stationed there did not let them in, after which at around 11 am, 50-60 people came and beat the security personnel first
 itnaa hi nahin mahila karmchaariyon se badasluki bhi kii, paise kii maang puri na karne ko lekar sho ko band karwaane kii dhamkee bhi di
 After that, he broke into a motorcycle of sabotage and even vandalized Raj Kundra's car
 studio main todphod hote dekh vahaan par tainaat raaj kundra ke bounsar or emenes kaaryakartaaon ke bich jamkar marpet hui
 The dnnagar police has registered a case under various sections including molestation, writing, recovery and started investigation
 police or khud raaj kundra donon hi abhi party kaa naam lene main hichkicha rahe hai

 kashmir jone police ne twit kiya, 'samudaay kii madad se ek or yuvak hinsa kaa maarg chhod kar apane parivaar ke paas laut aayaa he
 'keeping the security in mind, the information of the terrorist who surrendered has been kept confidential

 Jinnah's way of forcing two senior BJP leaders to face criticism within the party is exactly the same as the current president of the party, Gadkari, with a notorious criminal Dawood Ibrahim
 party ke bheetar kai varisht netaa gadakari se istife kii maang kar rahe hai
 These leaders include Yashwant Sinha, Jaswant Singh, Gurumurthy
 duusari orram jethmalanine saaf kaha he kinitin gadakarico tatkaal apane pad se istipha de dena chahie
 Jethmalani said that Kai does not become guilty by resigning
 unhone kaha ki gadakari ko apane pad se istipha dekar jaanch kaa saamana karnaa chahie
 It is not in the interest of the party to continue in his post
 isse pehle mahesh jethmalani ne bhi gadakari ke virodh main rashtriya kaaryakaarani se istipha de diya tha
 Senior BJP leader Jaswant Singh was also expelled from the party due to his book written on Jinnah
 unka party se nishkasana unke pustak-vimochan ke 26 ghante ke andar hi ho gaya tha
 At the time Jaswant Singh was expelled from the party, LK Advani was the most senior member of the Parliamentary Board
 isse pehle adwani jinna par die gaye apane bayaan ko lekar apana adhyaksh pad gavaan chuke thea
 During a visit to Pakistan in 2005, Jinnah was forced to step down after the then BJP President LK Advani described Jinnah as secular
 haalanki adwani ne apane bayaan ke paksh main pakistan kii neshnal asembli main 11 agast 1947 ko diye gayi jinna ke prasiddh bhaashan kaa hawala diya tha jisame unhone kaha tha ki naye raashtra pakistan main ab na koi hindu hoga or na musalmaan
 All will be Pakistanis and the state will treat all religions equally
 vaise yah alag baat he ki jinna kii is salaah par pakistani hukmaranon ne kabhi amal nahin kiya
 Now it will be interesting to see how long the current President of the BJP, Nitin Gadkari, after his statement given to Dawood Ibrahim, remains the President of the party

 If we can create rhythm then anything is possible
 kaagajon par bhartiya team bangladesh se behatar he or isamen kisi ko shaq nahin

 'bengali satr main ek patrkaar ne poocha, 'bangladesh main log jaananaa chaahate hai ki hamaare jeetne kii sambhaavna kitne pratishat he
 Will your answer be 50 percent? ' shaakib ne kaha, 'pratishat ginate rahane kaa koi phayda nahin he
 This will depend on the performance of that day
 ' ek anya patrkaar ne sawaal poocha, 'kya aapako tab dabaav yaa dikkat mahasoos hoti he jab media aapse sawaal karata he yaa aap ise prerana ke taur par lete hai
 Shakib said, "talking to the press is neither a problem nor inspiration
" main ise us tarah se nahin letaa

 aligarh kii congress raily main upi kii sapa sarkaar kii laptop skim kaa majaak banaate hue congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki yahaan upi main computer kii sarkaar he
 The computer does not run
 bijli nahin he
 But we run a government of authority in Delhi
 unhone upie ke rhite tu food bill ko upi main lagu na karne ko lekar bhi akhilesh yadav par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki logon ko sarkaar par iske liye dabaav bananaa chahie
 He referred to the recent Muzaffar Nagar riots in his speech, but refrained from taking bjp's name
 bhatta parsul kaa zikr kiya auki kaha ki bhoomi adhigrahan bill se desh main sabase zyada phayda aligarh ke kisaanon ko hoga
 But Rahul Gandhi did not give any reason for this claim
 unhone congress kii popular skiimon kaa zikr kiya or yuvaaon se kaha ki upi aapako badalanaa hoga
 Congress will have to change
 gaur karne vaali baat ye rahi ki kal mayawati par hamalavar rahul gandhi ne aaj sapa kii khinchaai kii
 Read what the Congress vice president said when someone wants to get land in Delhi
 to use market rate miltaa he
 But when land was taken from you, there was a government order and land was taken at a cheap rate
 maine aapse vaada kiya tha ki congress aapaki ye ladaai ladegi or jitkar dikhaaenge
 It took time, but we fought your battle and we brought the bill and showed it to pass
 vipaksh ke log khadey ho gaye
 First took him to the Standing Committee
 chakkar katwaaye, rokane kii koshish kii
 We took him to Parliament and passed him
 main aapako bataanaa chahta hum ki aligarh ke kisaan ko jitna phayda hoga, shaayad desh main kisi ko utana phayda nahin hoga
 We did another thing
 dekhie ham adhikaar kii sarkaar chalaate hai
 Now we have brought the right to food
 hindustan main ek rupee main bhojan ham sabko dene vaale hai
 Look here is a laborer
 ye sochate honge ki roj main mazdooree karata hum
 And this question arises in his mind, brother whether i will get food tomorrow or not
 kal mere bacchon ko bhojan milegaa yaa nahin
 i want to tell you that you will get it everyday, not just tomorrow
 is baat ko congress guarantee karegi
 And what is happening in UP
 suno main aapako bataanaa chaah rahaa hum
 What did the government say in UP
 puure hindustan main 35 kilo anaaj har parivaar ko milegaa
 all over the country
 magar upi main 2014 ke chunaav tak nahin milegaa
 Because the government of UP is saying that if we implemented the Congress Party's right to food here
 to chunaav main hamaari aisi pitayee hogi ki hamen baat samaj nahin aegi
 So i want to say that you pressurize
 upi kii gaanv kii garib kii janata ko 1 rupee main anaaj milanaa chahie
 This fight is yours, that of Congress
 jaise aapane bhatta parsol main ladaai ladi,sansad main ladi
 So tell me, you will fight, speak loudly
 kya naam he aapkaa
 If this Congress party wants to change Uttar Pradesh, you have to
 ye jo yuva khadey hai
 This is not going to happen with the SP-BSP
 main aapako ye bataanaa chahta hum ki congress party kii jab sarkaar banati he
 What we said in 2004
 2009 main kiya
 Scheduled to do in 2014
 aam aadmi kii, kamjor kii, garib kii, mahilaon kii sarkaar banaaenge
 We give the right to food, to employment, to education, which speaks of rights
 aakhri baat jo kahana chahta hum
 Riot occurred in Muzaffar Nagar
 us dange se aam aadmi ko, janata ko phayda pahunchaa kya
 People died jab log mar rahe the
 Hindus also died
 musalmaan bhi mare
 That's right
 usamen to kisi ne nahin poocha
 There i went hindu se baat kii
 Talked to a Muslim
 donon ne ek baat boli
 See, there is no enmity between us
 ye rajnatik logon ne kiya or hamaare ko yahaan barbaad kiya
 The fight is done brotherly
 rajnatik phaayde ke liye karai jaati he
 The common man does not want to fight
 aam aadmi pyaar se jeena chahta he, kaam karnaa chahta he
 India wants to move forward
 yahaan aisi rajnatik shaktiyaan hai, jo jaanati hai ki ladaai nahin hui to vah nahin jeet sakate
 He knows very well, so wants to have this fight
 ye sahi baat he yaa nahin
 i want to tell them that there is a history of India that we all stand together
 hindu ho musalmaan ho
 Be a sikh ye jo ladaai karaate hai
 We will not let them do it
 ye congress party kaa itihaas he
 We have every person equal
 ham nahin kehete ki kisi ek jati ko ye cheez do
 We say that if Hindustani is there then it will get the right to food
 upi peeche ja rahaa he, to isliye ja rahaa he
 Listen up kyonki aapako baanta ja rahaa he
 Until you guys are one
 jab tak aap log uttar pradesh kii baat nahin karoge, tab tak ye pradesh aage nahin badhegaa
 The Congress party will do this work
 ham aapke liye kaam karenge
 Will form the government of Uttar Pradesh and fight for you
 aap garmi kaa samay he
 You came from far away
 aapkaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Jai Hind' film rivyukoyalanchalectorvinod khanna, sunil shetty, vipinno, roopali krishnaravadiarectorashu trikhadurationah2 ghanta 48 minutestara5 main 1bihar kaa ek mashhoor kol mafia tha
 Suraj Dev Singh
 bataate hai ki baliya ke rahane vaale purv pradhanmantri or siyaasi samaaj main adhyaksh ji ke naam se mashhoor chandrashekhar ke ghanishtha mitra the
 The special thing is that like other leaders, Chandrasekhar did not hide this yari from Suraj Dev
 abhi is shaks kaa zikr isliye kyonki aaj jo film dekhakar aayaa hum vah inhen se prabhavit dikhti he
 How a man runs his parallel government, defying the government's efforts to nationalize coal mining
 kaise uske ishaare par bahubali apni taksaal main khauf ke lohe se kathith sammaan ke sikke dhaal baantate hai
 And how it keeps on going from year to year, decade after decade
 or phir ek galati, jo shuruyaat main choti dikhti he
 It mixes that person in the same coal
 magar ye plot sunne main jitna acha lag rahaa he
 The film is equally fatal
 yah kai kirdaaron par focus karne ke chakkar main dhundhlee ho jaati he
 In the process of showing terror, it becomes clunky and noisy
 ek vaakya main kahuun to raita failata he or aisa failata he ki simtaae nahin simatata
 And the film gets longer in this affair
 jharkhand main ek kol mafia he
 Name is Sarayu Bhan Singh
 koyala kaa theka sarkaar uthaati he, magar rajapur ilaake main rit uski chalati he
 Whoever tries to raise his head in the name of union, brutally and publicly crushes Saryu's ferocious Bahubali Karua
 sarayu kaa saaf kahana he ki koyalanchal main jo bhi uske raste aayega, koyala ho jayega
 But an honest IAS officer comes in his way
 nishith kumaar
 Nishith has to face mouth in the initial stages
 or jab vah sarayu par shikanja kasne ko hota he
 His own family gets into trouble
 ab ek taraf har jatan karne ko taiyaar police-prashasan he or duusari taraf karua kaa maalik yani koyala mafia
 The poems of Naxalite, gimmick, prostitute and rebellious attitude are all in this Hrabong
 magar sab kii sab bemaja
 Vinod Khanna is the central character of Sarayu in the film
 par unke chehre par apekshit thahari hui krurta kam hi najar aati he
 It is nice to see Sunil Shetty in the role of Nishith on screen after a long time
 magar unke jaise ection hero vaali image ke shaks ko bechaargi nibhaani nahin ai parde par
 Vipinno has also got good footage in Karua's role
 par vah apane role ke har shed ko nahin nibhaa paae
 Instead of the role of Rupali Krishnarao, the director worked harder to tease her blouse
 magar yah glamras nahin foohad lagata he
 Anurag Kashyap's film Gangs of Wasseypur had a sharp comment on the coal mafia
 jaahir he ki baar bahuch ooncha uth chukaa tha
 This film does not stop around him either
 diarector aashu trikha kuchhek jagah hi thode sadhe hue or control main lagate hai
 Narrated the revolutionary poem of Faiz Ahmed Faiz to the train union leader coal laborers
 phir karua jaisaa baagi jo hameshaa apane sicks pack dikhaane ke liye sirf genes main hi najar aata he, us kavita ko uski beti ko sunaae
 It all seems very fake
 film main rielity ke tadake ke liye launda naach or koyala khadaanon ke asal shots dikhaane kaa jatan kiya gaya he
 But Ashu loses his grip on the film only when the Hindi tone of that region is not able to catch
 agar aapako drama, romance or mardhaad se bharpoor kahani ke cockhare se anjaan bi grad kii filmein pasand hai, tabhi ise dekhne jaaie
