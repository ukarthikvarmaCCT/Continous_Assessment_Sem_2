 According to reports, Ankita is an air-hostess
 milind ne instagram acount par ankitha ke saath kuch kute tasviren share kar apane rishte ko public kiya tha
 Let me tell you that Milind married French actress Mayleni Jempanoi, but their relationship broke up in 2009

 He also dated actress Shahana Goswami after that

 The BJP has started preparing for 67 seats in the Delhi Assembly after winning 7 seats in the Lok Sabha by a large margin
 aam chunaav main mili sanket se bijepi hamalavar ho gai he
 After the recent results, Delhi government minister Gopal Rai said in a press conference that even today, Kejriwal has no option in Delhi
 jabaki vipakshi netaa vijendra gupta ne kaha ki aisa kahkar dilli kii janata ko bhramit karne kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 His saying this is highly misleading
 gupta ne kaha, "yah kahkar vah sheikhchilli vaali baaten kar rahe hai ki dilli main abhi bhi log vidhansabha chunaavon main kejariwal ko hi laane kii baat kar rahe hai
 AAP has pushed Delhi's development back many years in its nearly four and a half year tenure
 " netaa vipaksh ne kaha ki bhaajapa ne aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon kii taiyaariyaan shuru kar di hai
 Kejriwal is ready to expose the government's failures and misrule
 bhaajapa ab kejariwal ko dilli kii janata ko or adhik bhramit nahin karne degi
 Vijender Gupta said that the people of Delhi have given this mandate by giving 52 to 60 percent votes to BJP candidates in all seven seats
 bhaajapa kii lokapriyata or sweekaaryata congress or aam aadmi party donon ko milakar kahin zyada he
 It is clear that even if the two parties fought the elections in alliance, they still cannot deny their defeat that the fight was between Modi and Rahul
 “aap“ ne 6 maheene se prayek loksabhaa kshetra main apana warroom sthapit kiya, kol centaron dwaara tathaa pani kii tarah paisa bahaakar modi ji or bhaajapa ke viruddh har tarah se jehar ugalane or janata ko bhramit karne kaa vishesh abhiyaan chalaa rakhaa tha
 Manoj Tiwari also said the attack, apart from this, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari looked very excited after the fierce victory in Delhi
 unhone kaha, ek saansad ke rup main modi ji ko pradhanmantri banane ke uddeshy se bhale hi unki jeet hui ho lekin dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh ke rup main unki jimmedaari zyada badi he kyonki kareeb 19 saal se satta se dur bijepi ko dilli main jeet dilaani he
 He clearly said that now his next target is the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi, which said so much but could not make Delhi into Delhi
 tiwari ne kaha ki wo dilli ko paris yaa shanghai nahin balki aisi dilli bananaa chaahate he jahaan log bina pradooshan ke ji sake, ek saafe suthri dilli bananaa or logon ke jivan main parivartan laana he
 He said that even though he may have won as an MP, his responsibility as Delhi BJP President has increased considerably and now the assembly elections are going to be held in Delhi only after 6 months, in which Kejriwal is ousted from power
 BJP has to be brought out of the drought in Delhi and they hope that the way they have won the election, now the Aam Aadmi Party government from Delhi's power Dropping out is their next target
 bataa den ki manoj tiwari ne dilli kii satta main 15 saal tak kabiz rahi or vartmaan main dilli congress kii adhyaksh shila dikshit ko karaari shikast di he
 He defeated Sheila Dixit by 3 lakh 65 thousand votes ie Manoj Tiwari got 56 percent vote share in north-east Delhi only

 lekin brahmaputra nadi ke pani se mache is haahaakaar ke peeche kya china kii chaal bhi ho sakati he? ye sawaal isliye uth rahaa he ki baadh kii is tabaahi par kaabo paane ke liye china ne bharat ke saath samjhauta hone ke baavjood ahm jaankaree muhaiyaa nahin karai
 China did not provide important information Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar on Friday revealed that China has not yet provided hydrological data about the Brahmaputra and Sutlej river waters this year
 aamtaur par monsoon kii shuruuaat ke baad 15 may ke baad se china bharat ko in dononadiyon main panike bare main lagaataar jaankaree dete rahata he, jisase baadh se nipatane kii samay rahete taiyaari kii ja sake
 Both these rivers Brahmaputra and Sutlej originate from Tibet and flow into India
 china agar bharat ko har saal kii tarah in donon nadiyon main pani ke bare main jaankaree muhaiyaa kara detaa to tabaahi par kuch had tak kaabo paaya ja saktaa tha
 The agreement reached in 2006 was an agreement between India and China in 2006, under which the two countries together formed an expert group that shared information about the water level in these rivers
 is export group kii aakhri baithak pichley saal april main hui thi
 But this year China did not give any information about the water in these two rivers
 ye ho sakati he china kii chalavidesh mantralay ke pravaktaa se jab ye poocha gaya ki kya china ke dwaara jaankaree nahin diya jane kaa sambandh doklam main pichley do maheene se chal rahi tanatani he, to unhone kaha ki wo in donon maamalon ko aapas main nahin jodna chahenge kyonki kai baar iske peeche takneekee kaaran bhi hote hai
 But given the way China is threatening India on Doklam, it cannot be ruled out completely that it could also be China's move to bow down to India

 Speaking at the conclave, Mukesh Ambani praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that "it is a matter of happiness to meet a leader who understands technology"

 With this pure vegetarian (vegan) diet, Carver hoped to bring "greater health, strength and economic freedom to India"
 kya koi aahaar vastav main aisi bhavy mahatvakankshaon ko praapt kar saktaa he? kaarvar ke aahaar ke lakshith praptakarta ne nishchit rup se aisa sochaa tha
 Like Carver, Mahatma Gandhi was an emotional food reformer who believed that the right to a proper diet was at the core of the right to live, a good diet was as much concerned with politics and ethics as nutrition
 haalanki, aahaar vikalpon ko apni anya manyataon ke saath jodpha hameshaa aasaan nahin tha
 In fact, one of the reasons for the diet that Carver thought was that Gandhi had struggled to become a vegetarian for years
 unka maananaa tha ki doodh kaa seven aniatik he, lekin unhone paaya ki ise aahaar se dur karne se ve kamjor ho gaye or jivan kii kai jaruraton kii purti main asamarth ho gaye
 Can peanut milk prepared by a former slave help Gandhi fulfill his lifelong quest for a complete diet? When i started studying Gandhi's diet, i was interested in two questions: Gandhi's food with food What was the intention? And what could i learn from their culinary and nutritional experiments? a person who was extremely busy, still used to take time for articles, letters and speeches on diet related topics

 What can they still teach us how to eat and how to live? The first thing that struck me in my mind was that Gandhi linked vegetarian diet and whole grains, raw food and fasting to today's diet How things were realized at that time
 apane aahaar se namak or chini ko khatm karnaa, junglee saag ke liye majaboor karnaa or khud kaa baadaam kaa doodh bananaa, gandhi aaj ke yug main mujhe aahaar ke liye poster-child zyada lagate hai jabaki maine bachapan main skool main unhen kattarpanthi upnivesh virdohi kaaryakarta ke rup main padhaa tha
 But as i delved deeper into the history of Gandhi's relationship with food, i realized that his diet was linked to his politics
 gandhi ke liye, naitik rup se khaane kaa matlab kuch khaadya padaarthon se parhez karne se kahin adhik tha; iskaa abhipraay tha ki anyaay or asamanta ke khilaaf sangharsh ke liye hamen kya khaanaa he
 Gandhi was born into a vegetarian family
 yuva ke rup main, unka maananaa tha ki angrejon ko maance khaane ke kaaran hi bharat par vijay praapt karne kii shakti mili thi
 If they have to be strong then they also have to eat meat
 chupake se, ek din unhone bakre ke maance ke kuch tukade khaae the
 It was like a nightmare
 baad main us baat ko yaad karte hue unhone kaha tha, ''jab bhi mujhe neend kaa jhonka aata, aisa lagata jaise jivit bakra mere andar memia rahaa tha, or main pashchaatap se bhar uthta
 "before he started legal studies in London, Gandhi promised his mother that he would not touch" liquor, women and meat "
 england main, unke bheetar pehali baar shaakaahaar par vastav main purna vishwaas upja tha
 Although he avoided meat for most of his childhood, it was only in London where he decided not to eat meat for moral reasons
 is prakriya main, unhone pehla rajnatik kaaran paaya: shaakaahaar
 As a member of the London Vegetarian Society, Gandhi overcame his fear of public speech and became an activist struggling for the first time
 yaa yon kahen, ve kai muddon par aadhaarit sangharshon ke praneta ban gaye
 The vegetarian community attracted many social reformers and Gandhi learned to associate vegetarianism with many reformist causes and the broader concept of non-violence
 gandhi keval maance ko khaarij karne se santusht nahin the
 As his faith in vegetarianism deepened, he struggled with whether he should stop consuming not only meat but also eggs and milk
 antat: unka iraadaa pakkaa hua ki unhen purna shaakaahaari bananaa chahie
 But leaving milk was much harder than avoiding meat
 dashakon tak, unhone ek aisa shaakaahaari aahaar khoja jo doodh kii barabari kar sake
 By the time Carver prepared a recipe for peanut milk for him, Gandhi had already become skilled at preparing almond milk at home
 lekin moongfalee kaa doodh asantoshjanak sabit hua, shaayad isliye kyonki use pachaane main unhen mushkil hoti thi
 After all, Gandhi did some non-gandhian work
 unhone kabhi bhi doodh nahin pine kii kasam khai thi, lekin yah tay kiya ki unki pratigya main bakrii kaa doodh shaamil nahin he
 From goat meat to goat milk, Gandhi's vegetarian path was winding, often disappointing, but ultimately proving to be one of the biggest lessons of his lifelong struggle with food: that no one can get a full diet
 gandhi ne aaj ke kai sabase lokapriy aahaar siddhanton, vishesh rup se calories parhez or falon, subjiyon or baadaam vaale ucch aahaar kaa abhyaas kiya
 His personal and spiritual growth was deeply linked to his dietary development
 aahaar se unke prayogon ne hamen bahut kuch sikhaaya he, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki unhen bas ek saamaanya paathon tak samet diya ja saktaa he
 With the tendency of food pundits to present a simple solution to the dietary questions, Gandhi would either be astonished or irritated or perhaps both would be filled with emotion
 gandhi ne baar-baar apana vichaar badla
 He struggled with his diet and his struggles became as attractive as his diet triumph for me
 unka aahaar or raajnneetik sangharsh aapas main jude hue the
 He praised salt as a youth, stopped it completely in the middle of life and then began to consume it balancedly as he got older
 namak to unke savinay avagya andolan se judaa tha jisamen unhone namak banaaya tha
 If he had not churned a long thought about the right amount of salt in the food, he would have never imagined a 'salt journey'
 isi tarah, kachche bhojan or junglee bhojan main unki ruchi, poshan or rajnatik donon kaarnon se thi
 He repeatedly experimented with eating unbaked food, or what he called "important food", because it reflected his love for simplicity
 unhone mana ki khaanaa pakaane kii prakriya main poshak tatv kho jate the
 He wrote, "vitamin a is destroyed by mere heating," but his love for raw, wild greens has also been inspired by the feeling that the rural poor of India can find sustainable and affordable sources of nutrition
 
 sabase kathin kya he? yah vyakti kii aahaar baadhaon or apane swaad par nirbhar karata he
 i find it relatively easy to cut salt — though i have never tried to completely avoid it, like Gandhi
 main adhikansh prasanskrit mithaiyon kii jagah fal pasand karata hum or isliye main parishkrut chini kii gandhi kii asweekruti se bahut pareshaan nahin hum (haalanki jab mujhe dark chocolate kii peshkash kii jaati he, to main gandhi kii us baat ko aasaani se bhul jaataa hum ki ''chocolate main mrityu kii raah khulti he'')
 For me, the biggest struggle is - eating less
 niyamit rup se upwas ke alaava, gandhi aanshik niyantran ke master the
 As we are celebrating the 150th anniversary of Gandhi's birth, on that occasion it is appropriate to ask what we can learn from Gandhi, his legacy and his diet
 jaisaa ki kaarvar ke liye unki prashansa spasht karti he, gandhi ne khud kai logon ke saath hi saath apni galatiyon se bhi bahut kuch siikhaa
 Their diet was a form of engagement
 shaayad yahi gandhi ke aahaar se seekhney laayak sabase bada sabak he
 In our struggle to eat right and live the right life, we never fall alone

 Congress may have to bear the brunt of this in the upcoming assembly elections
 congress netaa bhi maanate hai ki chhattisgarh main basapa se gathbandhan na hone ke chalate kareeb do darjan siton par nuksaan party ko ho saktaa he
 Similarly, in Madhya Pradesh too, the Congress may have lost about 50 assembly seats
 pichley chunaav main basapa ko 4 siton ke saath kareeb 7 fisadi vot mili the or 80 siten aisi thi, jahaan basapa ko 10 hajaar se zyada vot mili the

 Who likes to read school books par un kitabon ke bich agar chachaa choudhary kii comics ho to teacher kii najar main padhaaku banane kaa acha mauka rahata tha
 Pran Kumar Sharma, who saved Uncle Chaudhary, Billu, Pinky and Sabu, today you are silenced in the noise of the world, all the memories of childhood are coming in front of your eyes
 bachapan kii naadaniyon main samajhadaari kii khidki lagane vaale praan sahab aapane bahut choti umr main hi naitik shiksha kaa jo paath hansate-khelte hue padhaayaa
 Only you and your characters could teach that lesson
 chachaa choudhary jinka dimag computer se bhi tej chalata tha
 Pran sahib, what a lively character you created
 jis umr main hamaare chehre se bachapan kii maasoomiyat tapak rahi thi, aapaki majboot kirdaar rachana kii vajah se ham bhi khud ko 70 saal kaa bina muunchon vaala chachaa choudhary samajhane lage the
 While reading them, we also started to feel that if mind is to run fast then Chacha Chaudhary should be read
 cycle panchar ho jane par skool se ghar tak kaise janaa he, tab ham aasmaan main chachaa ke style main sochane kaa dikhaava aise karte the jaise hamaara dimag bhi computer se tej hi chalata ho
 We were neither children nor life, therefore we were getting lost in your world
 sehat main ham log kurkure, lays ke packet jaise the
 Lightly, which looks a lot from outside, but nothing happens inside
 smalapan ke dinon main jab kisi se ladaai hoti thi, to ham aapke us jupiter planet se aae gabaru, jawan, pahalwaan sabu ko yaad kar lete the
 We used to jump on the battlefield remembering the balls of Sabu
 haalanki haddiyon main guda kam hone kii vajah se zyaadaatar haare hi hai
 But always used to give satisfaction to ourselves thinking that nobody will grow up, we will also have our own 15-foot sabu, then we will see this bloodless world
 praan sahab, chachaa-chachee (binni) kii nonk jhonk main ham apane dada-daadi ke pyaar ko khojane lage the
 The funniest one was to defeat the uncle's Raka dacoit every time and shave his mustache
 praan sahab, acha tha jo us umr main kisi dost kii moonche nahin thi varanaa raaka chachaa kii takkar ko dekhte hue ham bhi apane dost ko haraane par uski moonche mundava dete
 Pran Sahab, the names of your comic characters were Gobar Singh, Dhamaka Singh, Raka, Pinky, who used to climb easily in the tongue of children
 superman, phantum or tamaam paraye jaise naamon vaale kairactors ke bich aapane hamen hamaare agal-bagal ke kairactors se rou-ba-rou karavaaya
 Billu, whose big hair did not make her eyes visible
 sab ladkiyaan us par jaan chhidakati thim
 We also felt that this is probably due to hair growth
 par aap to samaj hi rahe honge na varchuel world kii teachers kii tarah is real world ke teachers bade dilavaale nahin the to kisi ne hamaare baalo ke ankhon tak aane kaa intjaar hi nahin kiya
 Our hair was cut, but like Billu, we did not give up our laughter and jokes and try to become a hero at the age of 14 years
 praan sahab, aapaki comics kaa hamaari mummy ne bhi khub sahaara liya
 The age that did not like to drink milk
 us umr main chachaa jaise dimag or sabu jaisi body ke liye hamane angoor ko chhodkar baari-bharkam tarbooz apane nanhen haathon main le liya
 We still remember those words of Uff Mummy that o little uncle Chaudhary may eat something
 praan sahab, aapane comic kairactors main apane humar se jo jaan foonki thi
 We still remember him
 aaj jab aapkaa karishmai dimag shant ho gaya he to hamen wo aapke saare comic kirdaar yaad aa rahe hai jinhone aaj is adhed si umr main pahunchane ke baad chachaa choudhary, billus, pinki, sabu ko hamaare saamne aisi diemension main laa khadaa kar diya gaya tha jiske liye koi tu, thri, five di kii jarurat nahin he
 Truth be told that you are Walt Disney of India
 jisaki barabari aaj yaa bhavishya main shaayad hi koi kar paae
 Because when life is no longer, the characters of life become silent
 praan sahab, jaldi lautiega
 In the charismatic style of his same comics in a new character
 taaki aane vaali naslein cartoon dekhakar cartoon jaise na bane
 Learn something the way people like us learned through your comic characters
 alavida praan sahab
 Will come soon

 In fact, it is very important to clean the surroundings of the lab in the office, but the sewer's dirty water was seen spread just a short distance from the lab
 is maamle main mantri ne adhikariyon ko notice bhi jari kiya he
 Apart from this, the problem of not getting the correct information to auto and taxi drivers also came up because many notices placed on the meter counter were out of date
 counter par saaf safai gaayab rahi, chaaron taraf dhul hi dhul najar ai
 The minister also directed the officials of the office present on the spot to put up new boards, hoardings and notices
 'ajtak' kii team ne mantri kaa gandagi se samaanaa karaayaa to turant mantri imran hossain ne adhikariyon ko camere ke saamne fatkaar bhi lagaai
 During this, Minister Imran Hussain met with auto and taxi drivers and also asked problems
 'dilli-ajtak' kii team ne mantri imran hossain ke saath us lab test kaa nirikshan kiya jahaan auto or taxi ke meter test kiye jate hai
 Here, the fixed fare of the government is uploaded in the meter, after testing the auto and taxi meter

 vibhaag kii jaankaree ke anusaar pratidin ek hajaar auto fere metron ke dobaaraa calibrasion kaa kaam nirdhaarit registration number ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, if an auto rickshaw driver is unable to get the calibration done on the scheduled date, then he can go to the taxi meter unit any day after the scheduled date

 The guidelines are being disseminated by The Zora Foundation, the new media arm of the terrorist group
 aies kii yah nai media shakha he
 The IS has been uploading videos of brutal hanging, violent atrocities, training of terrorists and threats to Western countries to carry out air strikes against it for their propaganda

 'inputah IANS The history of the property market has been divided into two periods by RERA (real Estate Regulation and Development Act 2016)
 ek main smita jaise log hai, jinhen noida ekstansion main teen maheene main flats dene kii baat kahkar paisa lene vaale builder ne do saal intjaar karakar rera lagu hone ke kuch maheene baad pajeshan diya or duusari ore, rijwaana hai jinhone 2009 main faridabad main flats book karaayaa, 70 fisadi paise de die lekin flats abhi tak nahin mila
 The time before RERA will be considered as unbridled prices and arbitrary of the builders, while the period after RERA will be called as the purchase of the property as per rules in a disciplined manner
 lekin adnge abhi khatm nahin hue hai
 Though the provisions of RERA were said to be weak but the builders are also facing problems
 karnataka, madhya pradesh, mumbai samet desh ke vibhinn haai corton main 22 yachikaayen rera ko lekar pad chuki hai
 Most are of builders and groups of buyers against them
 real estate market may ke baad na sirf zyada chaukanna ho gaya he balki isamen bada badlaav bhi aa gaya he
 Now builders are proving their credibility by disclosing RERA registration number in advertisements up to the radio
 rera ek brands ban gaya he, lekin dilli ensiaar ke kareeb chaar lakh kharidaaron ko ab bhi gharon kaa intjaar he
 There is still a movement of buyers whose relief was brought to RERA for the demand of getting a house
 sabhi maujuuda projects ko registration se chhot dekar neshnal capital rigen (ensiaar) main haryana or uttar pradesh sarkaron ne kanoon ko bilderon ke paksh main kar diya
 But the builders want more than this
 kanfederation of real estate developers association of india (cridai) ke adhyaksh gitambar anand kehete hai ki nae kanoon ko edjust karne main thodaa vakt lagata he
 Let the builder understand that Rera is not against him
 customer ke khilaaf unhen bhi adhikaar mili hai
 Can complain of non-payment customers
 yachikaaon par anand kehete hai ki lagu hone ke baad kanoon ko vyaavhaarik banane ke liye suzav aate rahete hai or ye yachikaaon ke rup main bhi hote hai
 If the government listens then it is okay or people go to the court
 rera ko pichhali taarikh se lagu nahin karnaa chahie
 There are many problems in bringing existing projects to RERA
 masalan, sarkari agenciyon kii letlatifi aadi
 Projects in which only paperwork is left should not be brought under its purview
 jinamein complishan ke liye aavedan kiya ja chukaa he lekin sarkaar kii vajah se der ho rahi he to isamen builder kii galati nahin he
 These disparities must be overcome
 noida ekstansion flats oners velfare association ke adhyaksh abhishek kumaar kehete hai, 'rera lagu hone ke baad se kareeb 20,000 flats logon ko mil chuke hai
 Two lakh people are still waiting to live in their house in Noida Extension
 hamane sarkaar se centre kaa rera lagu karne kii maang kii thi taaki maujuuda sabhi projects ko iske daayre main laayaa ja sake
 His organization has also filed a petition in the Allahabad High Court
 abhishek kehete hai, uttar pradesh main registration kii sharten dhili kar bilderon ko phayda pahunchaaya gaya
 The government removed the obligation of registration of all existing projects and removed 60 percent of the completed projects from its purview
 udhar, gudgaanv citijan council ne haryana rera ke khilaaf punjab-haryana haai court main yachika daakhil kii he
 Council President R
 es
 According to Rathi, "the Haryana government has given the builder freedom from RERA registration even on part completion
 isse gudgaanv ke zyaadaatar project rera ke daayre main nahin aa rahe hai
 Buyers did not get a chance to complain against the builders waiting for a long time and they are stuck
 ''vibhinn haai corton main bilderon kii yachikaaon main kaha gaya he ki is kanoon ko pichhali taarikh se lagu karnaa galat he
 The central government does not have the right to enact this law because land-building is a state subject
 is par centre sarkaar ne sabhi yachikaaon kii sunwaayee ek jagah par karne kii arji di
 On which the Supreme Court has immediately provided that without the decision of the petition pending in the Bombay High Court, no other High Court should execute the petition so that contradictory decisions can be avoided
 baharhaal, dilipakumaar mansukhlal gandhi kii adhyakshata vaali sansadeey samiti ne rera ke niyamon ko bilderon ke paksh main karne vaale rajya sarkaron ke notification kaa sangyaan liya he
 Especially in all states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, provisions have been made in the Act rules to keep the existing projects out of the ambit of RERA
 khaastaur par gudgaanv main sabase zyada maujuuda project act main pherbadal kii vajah se baahar ho chuke hai
 The committee, in its report submitted in August, has found Noida to be the biggest victim of the delay in giving flats
 yah samasya uttar pradesh ke alaava haryana main bhi rahi he
 The Central Government does not have any binding measures to prevent the states from changing the rules as the Constitution empowers the states to make laws on subjects like land and houses
 lekin sansadeey samiti kii report main shahari vikaas sachiv ke hawaale se kaha gaya he ki centre sarkaar kendriya salaahkaar parishad bana sakati he jo ki rera ke rajyon main lagu hone ke vibhinn pahaluon par salaah degi
 The process of its formation is in the final stage
 ensiaar byrs group ke rasesh purohit kehete hai, ''noida-greater noida main samasya vikat he kyonki yahaan kai log avaidh rup se apane flats main rah rahe hai
 The builder has not paid the arrears of authority
 is vajah se athurity complishan certificate jari nahin kar rahi he
 In such a situation, if the builder runs away, no one will have any choice
 '' sarkaar ke paas is sthiti se nipatane kaa koi plan nahin he
 Registration of all projects was required by 31 July
 iske baad ke sabhi project rera athurity avaidh qaraar de detii
 But some states have moved forward on this date
 dikkat yah bhi he ki bainkon ne aghoshit nirdesh de rakhe hai ki jo project rera main panjikrut nahin hai unhen na to karj or na hi bhugtan kiya jaae
 This has trapped buyers who are owed 10-20 per cent of the money and are not getting possession due to non-payment
 rera ab pashchim bengal, goa or tripura ko chhodkar sabhi rajyon main lagu ho gaya he jabaki uttar-purv ke chah rajyon main sanvaidhanik dikkat he (dekhen box)
 In some states including Assam and Goa, RERA has not been implemented due to sluggishness of governments
 das rajyon main isaki website bani he
 The situation is good in Maharashtra where more than 13,000 projects (more than 1
5 million houses) have been registered in RERA, over 9,000 agents have been registered and 215 complaints have also been lodged by buyers, in which penal work has already started
 idhar uttar pradesh main kareeb ek hajaar project registerd hue hai jinamein se paanch sau se zyada gautam buddha nagar or gajiabad ke hai
 There have been complaints here but no action
 yah sthiti zyada dinon tak shaayad na rahe kyonki kanoon lagu ho gaya he to uski jad main bilderon or kharidaaron ko aana hi hoga
 If the market is sluggish, CREDAI President Anand says that everything will be back on track in three to four months
 apni 600 uniwarsities or 32,000 collejon ke saath bharat ke ucch shiksha tantra kaa philhal china or america ke baad duniya main teesraa sabase bada thikaana he

 7 karod chaatr bhartiya uniwarsities main har saal pravesh ke liye aate hai jo puri duniya main uniwarsities ke kul registration kaa akele 10 fisadi baithta he
 Despite this, China spent one and a half percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on education in 2010 and raised its Central Universities count to 2,300, the same year the government in India scored 0 on education
 5 fisadi se bhi kam kharch kiya or pichley teen saal main yahaan ek bhi central uniwarsity nahin kholi gai he 
 At present, 12 bills related to education are stuck in the Parliament and the work of opening new institutes and recognizing the old men is still far-fetched

 NIIT Group Chairman Rajendra S
 pavaar kehete hai, ''desh main or zyada behtareen uniwarsities kholana kahin zyada jaruri ho chalaa he or janata ke bich kaarobaar se judi quality vaali profeshnal shiksha ko laana or bhi ahm he
 "while large public sector universities like Delhi University, Banaras Hindu University and Jamia Millia Islamia are struggling to improve their infrastructure, equip the campus with wi-fi, increase seats and expand e-facilities
" On the other hand, private universities have tried to adapt themselves to the needs of the youth of the twenty-first century quite rapidly

 Why are these romantic relationships so erratic? You will remember this dialogue of Alia Bhatt in the film Dear Zindagi
 jab do log pyaar main hote hai to ve duniya se kuch zyada hi beparwaah ho jate hai
 But for single people many times the same carelessness is missed
 agar aap bhi single hai auki aapke dost relationships main to aapkaa bhi in chizon se saamana jarur hua hoga
 Let us know which habits of the couple irritates the single
 
 
 
 Keep advising on the relationship - Why are you not in the relationship, when are you coming into the relationship? Like do not increase the hassle of single people by asking questions
 bhale hi aapako ehsaas naa ho lekin kuch log vaaki apni pasand se single rahanaa pasand karte hai
 Some people are not interested in relationships or they have already fallen in love many times, so they need time
 isliye har vakt apane single doston ko lav guru banakar relationships kii salaah naa dete phiren
 Garlic is a boon for health
 Keep giving examples of your love - Couple singers who show different kinds of dreams about the relationship do not forget to give examples of their relationship
 bhale hi saamne vaala unke idial relation main koi dilchaspee nahin rakhata ho
 Post love on Facebook all the time - Every girl likes to post such pictures on Facebook so that she can tell the world how much she loves her boyfriend
 aap kisi se kitna pyaar karti hai, ise har vakt bataane kii jarurat nahin he
 Performing love in public - well, we know that you both love each other and want to express it too but understand one thing from single people that you are not at home
 ho saktaa he ki single log kuch jaruri kaam kar rahe hon or aapkaa romance dekhne ke mood main nahin ho
 So Couples, Please Control Yourself! Cute Expressions- If you keep giving your boyfriend / girlfriend expressions like Baby, Sona, Janu and a xxrep 4 w on everything, then know that single people get irritated by this too

 We have a training program to mold BJP workers according to the 21st century party
 soshal media ke aujaaron sahit technology ke tamaam aujaaron kaa is ubhartee hui party main sateek istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, there are many other features that define this new BJP, for example, e-library, a department for good governance at the very lowest level of district and another department for policy and research

 How do you see the party's journey from being a party of traders to a party of the poor? The BJP is a party of traders, it was a misconception

 The emerging BJP will be invincible in electoral politics
 phir bhi yah mashin nahin, balki raashtra nirmaan kaa ek mishan he
 In Goa and Manipur, you did a politics of defection to form a government, then how do you deal with words like 'mission' and 'return to basic things'? i do not agree

 In fact, the number of such newcomers is not more than five per cent of the total strength of the party
 uttar pradesh main yah 10 fisadi se kam ho sakati he
 The allegation is that in states where the party is in power for two or three terms, there has been a 'congressisation' of the party, which means corruption and nepotism among the office bearers
 ekaadh udhaaharan ho sakate hai, par yah bhaajapa main sambhav hi nahin he kyonki hamaari party kaa vajood kabhi sarkaar par tikaa nahin rahaa

 Lack of rights has become a major challenge before the Aam Aadmi Party government, which has traveled more than two and a half years in power in Delhi
 aksar centre, alji or adhikariyon se ulajhane vaali 'aap' sarkaar ke mukhiya ne khud ko shaktiheen bataaya he
 'the Center has taken all the power from the Delhi Government' Arvind Kejriwal says that the Center has taken away all the power of the Delhi Government and while being the Chief Minister, he cannot appoint even a peon
 aazaadee ke baad koi aisi sarkaar nahin hogi, jo jiro power ke baavjood itnaa kaam kar rahi he
 In his speech 'dirty politics is ruining the country', Kejriwal fiercely targeted the central government
 kejariwal ne kaha, 'is desh me bahut tallent he, bas raajnneeti kharaab he
 If we won 67 seats, we are not allowed to work
 yahi gandi raajnneeti desh ko kha rahi he
 We have not yet achieved two big foundations of the whole movement, one Jan Lokpal and the other Swaraj because we do not have power
 ramlila maidan main jo kanoon lekar baithe the, wo janalokapal bill paas kar diya, lekin yah bill ab centre vaale lekar baith gaye hai
 'showing what they said', during the Aam Aadmi Party's 6th National Council meeting, Arvind Kejriwal shared the experience of the government in Delhi in front of party workers from across the country
 is dauraan kejariwal ne kaha, 'jab bhi rashtriya parishad kii baithak hoti he, 26 november kii yaad aa jaati he ki kis tarah andolan hua or party banani padi
 Today we have a government in Delhi, so pass the proposal with responsibility
 jo kaha wo karke dikhaa rahe hai or bhavishya main mauka mila to baaki chijen karke dikhaane kii takat rakhte hai
 "the public is happy with the AAP" During the whole speech, the interesting thing is that even once Kejriwal did not name Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 kejariwal ne kaha, 'centre kii bhaajapa sarkaar or aam aadmi party kii dilli sarkaar ko 2014 or 2015 main is desh ne bada bahumat diya tha
 In the last 3 years, the BJP government of the Center is spreading in every department
 unki sarkaar se kisaan, alpsankhyak, yuva, vyapaaree or gruhinee dukhi hai
 But every section is happy with the AAP government in Delhi
 ''bhrashtachar mitaane ke liye sarkaar banaai'bhrashtachar kaa zikr karte hue kejariwal ne kaha ki aam aadmi party ne bhrashtachar mitaane ke liye sarkaar banaai thi
 At that time, the 49-day government was like a film
 49 din ke andar puri dilli main bhrashtachar khatm ho gaya
 Traffic policemen stopped taking money
 un 49 dinon main adhikariyon main ek dar fail gaya tha, lekin jab 49 din khatm hue to police waalon ne puraane paise bhi liye or kaha ki bula ke laa tere kejariwal ko
 Kejriwal said, 'anti-corruption branch was taken away,' At that time there was a feeling of anti-corruption branch, we had created zero tolerance
 koi bhi bhrashtachar karata miltaa, to jail main daal dete the
 35 or 40 employees were jailed
 ek dehshat paidaa ho gai thim, lekin 2015 main 67 seat paane ke baad inhone hamase anti karpshan branch chin lee
 After this came a decision of the High Court in which all the power was snatched away by services, transfer postings and one by one

 This market of Daryaganj, associated with the identity of Old Delhi, has been sending books to every needy
 ab dilli ucch nyaayalay ke ek july ke aadesh ke baad sande book market ko band kar diya gaya he
 This has made many people unemployed
 pehali baar yahaan kitaab market nahin lagi, jisase ilaake main sannata pasra rahaa, saath hi kai chehron par udaasi ke badal mandara rahe the
 As per the court's directive, no weekly market will be allowed on Sunday at Netaji Subhash Marg (NS Marg) near Jama Masjid
 bataa den, dilli trephic police ne adaalat ko ek report saunpi thi, jisamen kaha tha ki enes maarg ek bahut vyast sadak he jahaan har samay hai trephic wolum rahata he
 In such a situation, when the booksellers occupy the sidewalk, there is no room for the pedestrians
 vahiin iskaa doosraa pahalu ye he ki salonsaal se student, pratiyogi pariksha kii taiyaari kar rahe logon, shikshakon or book lovers ko kitaaben bechney vaale logon ke saamne koi rasta nahin bachaa he
 Paharganj City Sadar Deputy Commissioner "veditha Reddy from Hindustan Times said that we are following the court order
 court ne anetaji subhash maarg ko 'no-squating or no-hawking' jone ghoshit kiya he, isliye kitaab bazaar yahaan nahin lag saktaa hecourt ke is faisle se 250 se adhik pustak vikritaon par kii roji roti par ban ai he
 Weekend markets are the only source of income for most of them
 20 saal tak dariyaganj main kitaaben bechney vaale surinder singh ne hindustan times se kaha ki main yahaan kitaaben bechakar har hafte kareeb 8000 se 10,000 tak kama letaa tha isse paryaapt rup se ghar kaa kharch nikal aata tha
 Now i am thinking about the future of my family
 pataa nahin ab ye bazaar phir se khulegaa bhi yaa nahin
 Northern Corporation officials said they are trying to move the market from here
 hamane kitaab vikritaon ko ravivaar ko ramlila maidan se bazaar chalaane kii salaah di, jab tak ki ek toun vending cameti kaa gathan nahin ho jaataa or unke liye ek sthaayee vaikalpik sthaan nahin mil jaataa he, lekin vikritaon ne inkaar kar diya
 We are trying to help them so that this popular market can run again
 ramlila maidan ke vikalp ke bare main kitaab vikritaon kaa kahana he ki ye market pehle se hi lokapriy he
 The second is that all programs and rallies take place in Ramlila Maidan
 vaise bhi, ham keval ravivaar ko hi bazaar chalaate hai
 Yet we remain in deficit in the days around Republic Day and Independence Day
 ramlila maidan main hamaara dhandha ekadam na ke baraabar ho jayega
 The market, which runs between Old Delhi's Delight Cinema and Golchha Cinema, was also temporarily closed in January last year, but was reopened after a five-week break
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki ab dobaaraa is bazaar ko chalane kii koi ummid jagati he yaa nahin
 Woods loaded on bicycles
 
 
 phir baiylgaadee or tractor par kate ped
 
 
 Woods being smuggled from the mountain river in such a manner and dozens of sawmill machines running silently for the wooded forests of India
 
 
 kuch din pehle kii ye photo paryaayavaran bachaane kii muhim par gambhir sawaal khadaa kar rahi he
 That is why we reached the Barini Border of India Nepal to know its truth
 ham isi border se nepal ke krishnanagar gaye lekin yahaan se taskaron ke khufia raste dekhne ke liye hamane aage kaa safar motorcycle se tay karne kii koshish kii
 Bhagwanpur is the last village of Nepal India Border, about 20 km from Krishnanagar
 yahaan bharat ke jangalon se taskari se laai jane vaali lakadiyon ke liye is tarah kii darjanon aara mashine gupachup tareeke se nadi ke behad kareeb lagaai hai
 The farmers of Nepal, who graze on the banks of the river, also said that wood is smuggled from here
 nepal kii yahi pahari nadi suhel dev vanya abhyaaran ke kinare bahati he or bharat ko nepal se alag bhi karti he
 That is why this river is proving to be suitable for timber smugglers
 isi nadi ke us taraf sohaleva vanya abhayaarany kaa bhambar jangal he
 We were just crossing this mountain river that in the daylight here, the Nepal smuggler couriers got the smuggling of common mango wood and cycling themselves
 ye sari lakadiyaan dhire-dhire bharat ke bhambar jangal se nepal pahunchaai ja rahi hai
 We got out our bikes before this mountainous river of border, then we crossed this river and reached the dense forest of Bhambhar
 barish ke sijan main pehali najar main ye jangal haraa bharaa dikh rahaa he lekin shaatir taskar kaise ped ko kaat kar chhipate hai or korier ke jariye dhire dhire nepal pahunchaai jaati he
 Apart from Bhagwanpur, a village in Nepal, there are many intelligence trafficking routes, where there are unique ways to cut old and precious trees
 lekin yahaan lakdi ke taskaron ke hamale kaa khatra hone ke saath saath keval paidal yaa cycle se hi ja sakate hai
 We decided to take the risk and reached the big Bhukuwa village in India, about 40 km from Bhagwanpur village in Nepal
 yahaan lakhon rupye ke sakhu ke ped ko kaatane ke liye lakdi taskar ne anokhaa tarika apanaaya he
 We are in this dense forest of Bhanbhar, neither mobile works nor there is any way to come here
 ham das kimi paidal chalakar yahaan pahunche he ab ye dekhie ped ko kaise kaata gaya he
 To weaken the tree, its root has been cut by the smugglers and then it will be burnt down
 When the tree becomes weak then it will be gently dropped and this wood will be transported to Nepal
 yahaan se kuch hi dur aage badhane par hamen ek or vishalkay ped dikhaa jise taskaron ne jad ke paas se jala diya gaya he taaki ye ped sookhkar gir jaae
 In the thick forest, as we are moving ahead, roots of many big trees were cut
 kuch ko taaja-taaja taskaron ne aadha kaata he or kuch ko barish hone ke chalate thodaa kaat kar chhod diya he
 Due to the value of these woods of Sakhu and Sheesham in lakhs, these precious trees of the forest are the target of the smugglers of Nepal
 motor cycle se chhipate-chhipate chalane ke baavjood hamaara saamana ped kaatane vaale taskaron ke korier se bhi hua
 They are in groups of four to five people
 kai baar ye bhaagane ke bajaae hamalaa karke van karmiyon ko maar dete hai
 Avoiding these smugglers, we somehow reached this forest post in the Bhambhar forest
 yahaan chaowkee ke baahar jabt kii gai lakhon kii lakadiyaan hai or andar kabad kii shakl main taskaron kii cycle
 This forest guard, including the forest guard, has the responsibility of guarding 1822 hectares of forest on the shoulders
 khud foresti guard ne bataaya ki jangal main gasht ke dauraan wo hamaari jaan kii guarantee nahin le saktaa he
 Now you would have come to know that Suheldev Wildlife Sanctuary has 452 sq km with about 150 km border with Nepal
 haalanki pichley saalon ke aankadon ko dekhe to jangal vibhaag ne 2018 main suheldev vanya jeev abhyaaran main 440 avaidh kataan ke maamle darj hue the jabaki is saal ab tak 149 cese darj kiye gaye hai
 Similarly, 232 trees were cut last year, but this year, 66 trees have been reported to be cut
 suheldev vanya abhayaarany ke mukhya van sangrakshak sujoy banerjee kehete hai ki avaidh kataan kuch log sangathit tareeke se karte hai
 We also conduct raids on the basis of information but the government needs to pay special attention to Suheldev Wildlife Sanctuary to save this age-old prized forest which is currently under threat due to timber smugglers and growing population

 The festival of Maha Shivratri (2019) is being celebrated on 4 March this time
 is din shiv bhakt bhagwaan shakanr yaa bholenath kii puja-archana karte hai
 Go to the temple and anoint it with milk, stay hungry all day and fast, offer fruits and flowers on the Shivling
 deepak jalaakar bhagwaan kii aradhana karte hai
 But on the most special day of Mahashivratri, bell letters are offered on the Shivling
 aisa mana jaataa he ki mahashivaratri (mahashivratri 2019) ke din bhagwaan shiv kii puja bel patr(bel Patra) ke bina purinhin hoti
 Find out the reason here hindu puraanon main ek behad prachlit katha ke anusaar sagar manthan ke dauraan jab amrit ke liye devataaon or rakshason ke bich yuddh chal rahaa tha, tab amrit se pehle sagar se kalkut naam kaa vish niklaa
 This poison was so dangerous that the entire universe could be destroyed by it
 lekin ise sirf bhagwaan shiv hi nasht kar sakate the
 Then Lord Shiva kept the poison called Kalkuta in his throat
 isse unka kanth (galaa) nila ho gaya
 Lord Shiva was named Neelkanth after this incident
 lekin is vish ke prabhaav se bhagwaan shiv kaa mastishk garm ho uthaa or unke kanth main jalan hone lagi
 All the gods got worried after seeing their suffering
 unke kanth kii jalan ko kam karne ke liye sabhi devataaon ne unhen bel patr khilaayaa, jisase vish kaa prabhaav kam ho gaya
 Since then, the bell letter has special significance in the worship of Shiva
 itnaa hi nahin manyata yah bhi he ki bhagwaan shiv dwaara vish pikar puure sansar ko isse bachaane kii is ghatana ke upalaksh main hi mahashivaratri manaai jaati he
 Apart from this, it is believed that the devotee who worships Lord Shiva with the Bel Patra gets the fruit of bathing in the pilgrimages

 ) Vikas Bahl, director of Kangana Ranaut starrer 'queen', has recently been accused of physical abuse by a female employee of his own production company Phantom Films
 mumbai mirar main chhapi khabar ke anusaar vikaas bahal ko is khabar ke baad phantum films se baahar kar diya gaya he
 But Vikas Bahl has denied both this arope and the things to be removed from the production house
 vikaas bahal diarector anuraag kashyap, vikramaditya motwane or madhu matena ke saath production house phantum films ke maalik hai
 There is an allegation of physical exploitation in Goa with a female worker of this production house on development
 vikaas ne is mahila ke apni karmchaaree hone se inkaar kiya he
 According to the news of Mumbai Mirror, one of the Phantom's shareholder said, "we (reliance Entertainment and Phantom Films) have taken a very strong step on what we have heard and investigated
 ' unke saath hi maamle se jude kuch or logon ke anusaar, vishakha guidelins ke anusaar ek cameti kaa gathan ho chukaa he or vikaas bahal jo offis janaa pehle se hi band kar chuke hai unhen 28 march ko ofishali unke pad se hataa diya gaya he
 The comments apane upar lage aropon kaa khandan karte hue vikaas bahal ne mumbai mirar ko bataaya, 'aisa kuch bhi nahin hua hai
 i am still running the company
 aisi koi shikaayat echaar tak nahin gai he or koi vishakha cameti nahin banaai gai he
 Meanwhile, the stakeholder says, 'the decision has yet to be taken because it is not just that
 aise ek yaa do nahin balki kai peedit hai
 He has behaved badly in the past, but this is the first time a complaint has come and we will have to act on it
 ' On the other hand, Vikas Bahl says that Phantom films are like family for us
 vikaas ne kaha, 'log mujhe kaaphi pasand karte hai
 i do not know how someone has fallen to this level
 maine is company ko shuru karne ke liye apane kai kaam chhod die hai

 mumbai mirar kii khabar ke anusaar phantum ke hissedaar main se ek ne kaha, 'hamane (reliance antertenment or phantum films) jo bhi suna he or padtaal kii he, usko lekar kaaphi kadaa kadam uthaaya he
 According to some other people associated with the case, a committee has been formed according to Visakha guidelines and Vikas Bahl, who has already stopped going to office, has been removed from his post on March 28
 tippaniyan Refuting the accusations, Vikas Bahl told Mumbai Mirror, "nothing like this has happened
" main abhi bhi company chalaa rahaa hum
 No such complaint has gone to HR and no Vishaka Committee has been formed
 isi bich hissedaar kaa kahana he, 'faisla abhi liya janaa he kyonki yah sirf itnaa hi nahin he
 There are not one or two but many victims
 vah pehle bhi bura bartaav kar chuke hai lekin yah pehali baar shikaayat saamne ai he or hamen is par kadam uthanaa padegaa
 ' vahiin vikaas bahal kaa kahana he ki phantum films hamaare liye parivaar kii tarah he
 Vikas said, 'people like me a lot
 mujhe nahin pataa koi is str tak kaise gir gaya
 i left many of my jobs to start this company
 ' bataa den ki vikaas bahal ne aakhri film aalia bhatta or shahid kapur ke saath 'shandaar' banaai he

 portugal ke jaadui khilaadi christiano ronaldo bhi kuch aisi hi baat sabit kar chuke hai
 We hardly doubt these players
 ve sabakaa dhyaan khinchate hai
 Messi of Argentina plays as if he had invented the game
 unki pratibha pushtaini lagati he, par ye baaten itane par hi jaakar khatm ho jaati hai ki ve diego maradona ke baad sabase umdaa khilaadi hai
 Maradona was Argentina's last World Cup superstar, having won the Cup in Mexico 1986
 sabase garib samudaay se aae maradona ko desh main hero mana jaataa he
 He is loved by people, but not Messi
 ve apni vilakshan kshamta or santulan ke maamle main kai tarah se maradona se milte-julate hai, lekin ve argentina se bhaavnaatmak or bhautik rup se bahut dur hai
 Nevertheless, if they get this World Cup, then all the bets and bets will go away
 argentina ko is toornament main kuch had tak aasaan shuruyaat mili he
 Luck has supported him in the qualifying group's draw
 group epa main iran, bosnia- harjegovina or nigeria ke saath maujuud argentina kii team main aakraamak khiladinnon kii kami nahin he
 Sergio Acuero, Edgekill Lavezzi, Angel Di Maria and Gonzalo Higuain will do it well, but the team's defense is weak
 argentina apni rakshapankti ke kisi bhi khilaadi kii kshamta ko world cap main aajamaa saktaa he, lekin messi or unke hamalaa bolne vaale saathi shaayad haar ko taalane main kaamyaab na hon
 Goalkeeper Sergio Romero was handed over to Monaco last season
 ve shaayad hi kabhi team ke liye khelen or dephender martin demicalis majaak ban gaye hai, kyonki ve majaak kaa paatr hi lagate hai
 There is no defense except Edgiel Gare
 phir bhi logon ko ummid he ki team apane group main top par rahegi
 If his defense faced the best teams, everyone would be surprised
 is sab ke baavjood varshon tak acha pradarshan na karne or pramukh pojishan par pratibha kii kami se jujh rahe argentna ke liye pichley kuch varshon main kaamyaab hone kaa yah sabase acha mauka ho saktaa he
 There is a lot of pressure on Messi
 messi 13 saal kii umr main barsilona chale gaye the
 His physical development was stunted in childhood and the club proposed to pay for the treatment of human growth hormone required by him
 messi kii bolchaal kaa lahaza aaj bhi apane shahar rozaario jaisaa he
 They like Argentinian food and are not able to mingle with the Spanish culture
 unhone laa liga or champions lig kii kamyaabi se spain main khub naam kamaaya he
 Yet they are not considered Catalan or Spanish
 argentina main bhi log unhen bahari samajhate hai
 His identity of playing football is well known and that is why he seems to be different from fellow players of his country
 unhone barsilona ke mashhoor training ground laa masia main khelnaa siikhaa he, jahaan khiladinnon ko chote-chote paas dekar or takneekee maharath ke saath khelnaa sikhaaya jaataa he
 They are entirely Barcelona players
 messi kii kamyaabi ke sabase shandaar daur ke gavaah pep guardiola ne khud ko nae jamaane kaa sabase asardaar coach sabit kiya
 He first won the Champions League and La Liga in the first season when he took charge of the first team
 uske baad bahut kuch hua
 His idea was to create a core of such players learned in La Masia, who follow the rules of tiki taka
 isamen khilaadi chote-chote paas dekar ball ko lagaataar apane kabje main rakhte hai
 This method is also the most exhausting, both mentally and physically
 inamen messi ke alaava jaavi harnandej, andraej iniyesta, petro rodrigese or sarjeeo baskets shaamil hai
 These are all great players, but Messi is undoubtedly the greatest
 unhone har tarah ke gol kiye hai
 Spain took these Barca players and using their methods won not only the World Cup but also the European Championship
 yah argentina kaa khel nahiorgentina main baat alag he
 It is played there in its own way
 unka khel zyada sidhaa or kam nafis he
 Other players may be more accustomed to this style, but Messi's impact is diminished when he does not play with players who perform well
 barsilona main jab ve pehali team main utre to unhen brazil ke guruon ne apana liya, jo samaj gaye ki ve kitne khaas hai
 There was no concerted effort in Argentina to adopt them, nor was there any indication that they wanted to be part of this family
 unhone ab tak desh kii team ke liye apni bhavanaaen sirf ek baar jaahir kii hai, jab unhen pehali baar main hi nikaal diya gaya or unke aansu nikal aae, lekin ho saktaa he ki ye aansu deshbhakti kii bajaae apni niraashaa ke hon
 This is also different, as Messi has scored a majority of the 365 goals he has scored for Barcelona
 ve aise sijan main hue, jab team ko kamyaabi mili
 Messi has scored 37 goals in 83 matches for Argentina and these are the goals that could not win the trophy
 kuch log kahenge ki unhone 2008 main olympic jeeta tha, lekin ise khilaadi yaa prashansak pyaar bhari najaron se nahin dekhte
 The obvious thing is that unless they give Argentina a win, they have no meaning for Argentina
 unke apane shahar main bhi is garv kaa koi saboot nahin miltaa ki ve vahaan paidaa hue
 Perhaps the reason is that he did not live in that city after having experience in Barcelona
 argentina ke log apane khiladinnon kii puja karte hai, lekin messi ko aisa sammaan nahin mila
 This country lives on those players, who play on the national tradition's position - enganche or hook
 engaanche vah khilaadi he, jo hamale shuru karata he or agar use jaisaa khelnaa chahie, vaise kheltaa he, to vah nafis or shaan vaala lagata he
 He does not need fast and he does not score countless goals
 pichley kuch dinon main is tarah ke khiladinnon main ek naam yuan roman requalm kaa he, jo messi ke paanv jamane se pehle barsilona chhod gaye the or vahaan naakaamayaab hi rahe the
 The other name is Yuan Sebastian Veyron, who retired from Estudiance for the second time this season
 unhone isi club se khelnaa shuru kiya tha
 Both these players were like Messi is not
 sab jaanate hai ki messi argentina ke behtareen khilaadi hai or maradona ke baad sabase achche hai
 Yet no man stands with passion to Messi, because there is no one who can stand up against them thoughtfully
 ve pichley kuch varshon main lagaataar europe main behtareen khilaadi rahe hai or isliye duniya main sarvottam hai
 Instead, Requellm and Veyron seem like strangers in the field
 unhone itnaa dhimaa khel khelaa ki puraane pad gaye
 There is something special in using that position
 haalanki baaki duniya ne unhen bhulane kii koshish kii, par kabhi-kabhi ghaatak paas or khubasurat khel se unhone duniya ke ghutane tikwa die
 His occasional talent seems to be more romantic than Messi's ability to show great game in every match
 ve jis tarah se khelte hai, asli argentina vaale lagate hai, jabaki messi asli messi hai
 Messi is truly a product of modern football and his talent gives him the ability to quickly define it and rise above it
 ve human growth hormone kaa upyog karte hai, yah choton ke nae takneekee upachaar or us fitness ke vikaas kaa ang he, jisane insaanon se bade footballar taiyaar kiye hai
 Now players can play 70 games in a season with full enthusiasm
 ve ghutane kii gambhir choton se chah maheene main ubar sakate hai, jabaki 1990 ke dashak tak ye chotein kariyar khatm kar detii thim
 These players run amazingly fast and remain straight even after being surrounded by other players
 messi apane santulan or aisi chunautiyon se haar na maanane kii apni durlabh kshamta ke liye mashhoor hai or apane pratidwandvi christiano ronaldo ko chhodkar baaki sab ke liye is takat kii behtareen misaal hai
 Ronaldo's presence and audacity is what Messi is not
 ham akasar messi ko samajhane kii koshish main portugali khiladinnon se tulana karte hai or unase fark karke yah jaanane kii koshish karte hai ki messi kitne mahaan hai
 The second best player in the world, Ronaldo is the proudest second best player in the world today
 champions lig final main gol daagne ke baad unhone qamar tak kapade faad liye taaki camere unke dealdol ko kaid kar len
 There have been countless speculations that he was desperate to become a better player than Messi
 ronaldo vaise behtareen khilaadi nahin bananaa chaahate, jaisaa ban sakate hai, balki baaki sabhi khiladinnon se behatar hona chaahate hai
 In comparison, Messi is often polite and ordinary due to his calm nature
 haal hi main sabase zyada paise lene vaale khilaadi banane ke liye qaraar par molbhav or tex chori ke aarope bataate hai ki yah mahaj bahari dikhaava ho saktaa he
 Comparing Messi with another player, it proves why he has not been appreciated in his country so far
 barsilona team main unke nae saathi nemaar kii umr sirf 22 saal he or brazil se unka gaharaa rishta he
 In the early years he lived in Brazil
 isliye kam umr main hi desh kaa chaheta banane lage
 Success in the domestic league started attracting people from all over the country every week and Neymar's talent started to get better as the level of play in Brazil was weak
 nemaar ne bhadkila hair cat apanaaya or kaarobaari kamyaabi ne unhen brazil main itani prasiddhi dilaa di, jitani messi ko argentina main nahin mili
 Messi does not go to clubs at night, but Neymar is seen having fun
 ek tarah se kaha ja saktaa he ki argentina messi kaa divaana nahin ho saktaa, kyonki messi ne use divaana karne ke liye kuch nahin diya
 This is the last chance for the World Cup Messi after a disappointing season
 uske baad to unhen barsilona ke liye pasinaa bahaanaa hoga
 This year he scored 41 goals, his lowest since 2008-09
 world cap is pidaa ko bhula saktaa he, lekin iskaa arth usase kahin zyada hoga
 a victory in the World Cup would give Messi a recognition in his country
 iskaa arth yah bhi he ki guardiola ke raaj main barsilona ke dabadabe se mukti milegi
 Guardiola left Barcelona in 2012
 is jeet se shaayad yah bahes bhi khatm ho jaaegi ki sabase acha khilaadi koun he, ronaldo yaa messi
 But it is impossible to tell what this World Cup will mean for Messi more than all of us who speculate

 is praavdhaan se bharat sarkaar main civil padon evam sevaaon or shikshan sansthaanon main daakhile main variyata aadhaar par aarakshan kaa laabh milegaa

 In which Dr
 ambedkar byaaj sabsidi yojana ibisi or obisi ke liye videsh main adhyayan karne ke liye-2014-15 main lagu kii
 From the year 2018-19 onwards, NBCFDC has also included EBC as a target group for imparting skill development training along with OBC and DNT
 unhone kaha ki ve vyakti jo anusuchit jatiyon, anusuchit janajatiyon tathaa saamaajik evam shaikshik rup se pichde virgon ke liye aarakshan kii yojanaon ke antargat cover nahin hote hai or jinke parivaar kii sakal vaarshik aay 8 lakh rupye se kam he, kii aarakshan ke laabh ke liye edablyooes ke rup main pahchaan kii jaae

 Once again winning the political battle of Uttar Pradesh, the land of the bundelo-harbol and the Veeranganas was in the shelter of Bundelkhand
 yah mahaj ek sanyog nahin tha
 After losing the last assembly election in UP, the newly formed state executive made preparations for the Lok Sabha elections in April 2013 by first meeting in the religious city of Bundelkhand, Chitrakoot

 The slogans like 'jai Shri Ram' were not echoed even once in the two-day meeting, nor was any such issue touched upon, where the shadows of Hindutva were seen
 ram mandir kii jagah 'gaay' siyaasi agenda par aa gai
 Although the bjp's promise of giving free cows to the poor in the manifesto of the 2012 UP Assembly elections could not generate any enthusiasm in the public, yet a proposal like giving grants to the cowherds gave the bjp's clout towards new issues involving the public Only said ab jabaki vidhansabha chunaav kii ghoshnaa main chah maheene se bhi kam samay rah gaya he, bijepi upi main aise mudde or saamaajik sameekaran abhi tak talash nahin pai he, jo party ke liye ram mandir jaisi lahar paidaa kar saken

 iske baad se hi bijepi bispi ke kuch varisht netaaon ko bijepi main laane ke liye gupachup abhiyaan chalaa rahi thi
 Though the party's strategy was to take this step just before the assembly elections, the way Mayawati strengthened her Dalit base in UP in the last month and a half forced the BJP to change the strategy
 bijepi ab bispi main send lagaakar daliton ke bich bispi ko lekar ek bhram kii sthiti paidaa karnaa chaahati he
 Confusing Modi, the Congress has started campaigning aggressively by declaring Sheila Dixit as the chief ministerial candidate, raising the bjp's concern

 'anderson ke anusaar bharat ke khilaaf kheli jane vaale test siries se vah kaaphi zyada utsahit the
 But he will not only be physically disturbed by this schedule, but also mentally he will face difficulties and due to this series he will have to miss some matches of his county team

 Love in Haryana can be fatal
 khaskar tab jab prem jati se baahar ho yaa gotra ke andar ho
 In such a situation, what if you add a lover? The answer comes from the story of Kapil and Sonia
 sonia pashreja ke mata-pita apni pasand ke ladke se uski shaadi karwaanaa chaahate the, par vah to kapil gandhi ko dil de chuki thim or uski khatir kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar thim
 So this loving couple of Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar ran away from home and got a court marriage on July 21 last year
 jaise hi donon hakeekat ke dharaatal par aae to sakate main aa gaye ki ab jaaen kahaan? unke saamne chah saal pehle khap ke aadesh par manoj or bubbly kii kaithal ke paas bas se utarkar berahami se hatya karne kii misaal thi
 Both of them spent the first night of their new journey at the Safe House on Jhajjar Police Line
 jahaan kamare main ek purana, jarjar palang tha
 Neither a mattress, nor a pillow
 kamare kii khidki par paradaa tak nahin tha
 Sonia says, "the condition of the safe house was such that it seemed, when will one get rid of here
" ” lekin kapil kehete hai, ''jo bhi tha, kam-se -kam ham khushkismat to hai ki ham sahi-salaamat hai or ab ham apane ghar main khush hai
 "these safe houses are becoming the safe haven of such loving couples these days who want to save their lives due to fear of Khap and society
" haryana main honor kiling jis teji se badi he, prem vivaah karne waalon kii sankhya usase zyada teji se bad rahi he
 This is the reason that after the creation of Safe House in 2010, the number of couples visiting here has increased every year
 sonipat main 2010 main sirf ek joda protection ke liye aayaa tha
 The following year the number increased to 30
 phir 2012 main 58 or 2013 main 84 logon ne court ke aadesh par sonipat ke sef house main sharan lee
 Around 45 to 55 newly married couples come to the Chandigarh High Court every day for protection
 par har koi kapil or sonia jitna khushkismat nahin hota
 On 18 September last year, Nidhi Barak and Dharmendra Barak of village Girnavathi near Rohtak were murdered because they loved each other despite being a gotra
 hatya karne vaale koi or nahin, ladki ke pita, chachaa, maa or parivaar ke hi log the
 He beheaded Dharmendra, cut several pieces of his body and threw the dead body in front of his house
 is hatya se bhi zyada dahalane vaala tha, nidhi ke pita billus kaa vah khaufnak bayaan, ''maine kuch galat nahin kiya
 If needed, i will do it again
 ” june, 2013 main hafte ke bheetar lagaataar honor kiling kii chah ghatnaayen huin
 Rinku and Monika of Jat community in Nimriwali village of Bhiwani district were killed by their family members and hanged the corpses in front of their house
 sonipat main deepak kumaar or tina jha ke parijanon ne unhen itnaa utpeedit kiya ki donon ne train ke aage kudakar apni jaan de di
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, Haryana tops the country in honor killing
 haryana ke enjio raah group ke mutabik, 2010 se lekar ab tak honor kiling ke takreeban 46 maamle saamne aae hai
 In view of this, there is a need to further strengthen the safe house system
 premi jode maanate hai ki yahaan aakar suraksha to mil jaati he lekin privesi or swatchta ke maamle main ye bahut utsahjanak nahin hai, or jivan kaidiyon jaisaa ho jaataa he
 In November 2010, the Haryana government had ordered a protection house or safe house to be built in every district to provide protection to couples who marry their own love
 so aanan-fanan main shahar kii kisi bhi maujuuda sarkari imaarat ko sef house main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 For example, in Fatehabad, a room in the back of the police line has been made a safe house
 kamare main ek takhtposh ke sivaa or kuch bhi nahin he
 There is also no separate toilet
 kamare ke baahar kooda padaa he
 The water leaking from the tank has dampened the roof and walls of the room
 jhajjar, sonipat or hisar main bhi do kamaron ko sef house main badal diya gaya he, jahaan kai baar ek hi kamare main teen-chaar jode rahane par majaboor hote hai
 In some districts there is only one room, there is no separate arrangement for the policemen
 kaithal ke sef house main rah chuki 24 varshiya gudinga kahati hai, ''mere samay chaar or jode the or ham sab ek hi kamare main rahete the
 There was no system
 yahaan tak ki hamaara koi mitra-shubhachintak milane bhi nahin aa saktaa tha
 "on this, the National General Secretary of the People's Women's Organization, Jagmati Sangwan, says," The police made the protection home in one room and assumed that the administration's responsibility was fulfilled
 sawaal yah he ki ye sef house kitne sef hai? buniyadi suvidhaon se vanchit in jagahon main jaakar jodon kaa jivan kaidiyon jaisaa ho jaataa he
 The insensitivity of the police is no less painful for these loving couples
 sonipat ke amit or varsha (badla hua naam) maanate hai ki sef house main milane vaali suvidhaon kii parvaah unhen nahin he lekin, ''jab ham suraksha ke liye police ke paas jate hai to ve sabase pehle hamen sir se lekar pair tak ghoorte hai
 Like we are criminals and thieves
 ”varsha rote hue kahati hai ki thane main police vaale bhi bolte hai, ''gharavaalon kii naak kyon katwa rahi ho
 “major police officers are also aware of this
 sonipat ke varisht police adheekshak arun nehra kehete hai, ''police force main bhi usee samaaj ke log aate hai
 Therefore, there is a need to make the police more sensitive along with making laws
 ”acchhee baat yah he ki rajya ke 21 sef houseej main 2010 main court se suraksha paane vaale jodon kii sankhya 366 thi jo 2012 main 1,345 par pahunch gai
 It is certain that there is no dearth of Parvans who are on the path of love and safe houses will continue to play an important role in this
 haryana kii mahila evam bal vikaas mantri gita bhukkal kahati hai, ''honor kiling rokna hamaari sabase badi chunauti he
 The most victim of this is girls because they are considered the honor of the house
 ” The month of Sawan has started
 shiv bhakt bholebaba ko manaane kaa koi mauka nahin chhodana chaahate hai
 The Shiva Linga is considered to be the formless form of Shiva
 shiv puja main isaki sarvaadhik manyata he
 Shivling consists of both Shiva and Shakti
 shivlinga ki upasna karne se donon kii hi upasna sampoorn ho jaati he
 There is a provision of worshiping different types of Shiva lingas in Hinduism such as Swayambhu Shivling, Narmadeshwar Shivling, Janeudhari Shivling, Gold and Silver Shivling and Parad Shivling
 haalanki swayambhu shivlinga kii puja ko sabase zyada mahatvapurn or faldaayi mana jaataa he
 Special rules related to the establishment of Shivling - worship of Shivling is the most important worship in Shiva worship
 - shivlinga ghar main alag tarah se sthapit hota he or mandir main ise alag tareeke se sthapit kiya jaataa he
 - Shivalinga is installed anywhere, but its altar should be facing towards north
 - ghar main sthapit kiya jane vaala shivlinga bahut zyada bada nahin hona chahie
 It should be more than 4 inches long
 - mandir main kitna bhi bada shivlinga sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 - To achieve special purposes and wishes, he is worshiped by making earthly Shivling
 shivlinga kii puja main kya kya arpit karnaa chahie ?- shivaji kii puja main jal or belptr, donon vastuon kaa vishesh mahatv he
 - Both of these things can be duly worshiped to Shiva
 - iske alaava kaccha doodh, sugandh, ganne kaa ras, chandan se bhi shiv ji kaa abhishek kiya jaataa he
 - Shiva should never offer semal, juhi, kadamb and ketaki
 shivlinga par kuch bhi arpit karte samay kin baton kaa dhyaan-- shiv ling par jaleey padaarth arpit karte samay uski dhara banaakar arpit karnaa chahie
 - While offering solid material, apply it to the Shivling with both hands
 - shiv ling par kuch bhi arpit karen, ant main jal jarur arpit karen
 - Do not offer vengeful things on Shiva linga, also should not use Maran

 According to Pawan Kamra, deputy commissioner of the Food and Safety Department, further action will be taken after the lab test report
 soshal media par pichley dinon viral hue video main kake da hotel kaa ek karmchaaree chat par bartan main pair rakhe dikhaai diya
 Pawan Kamra said that he had received a complaint through the alleged video that the dough was kneaded in the hotel which is against the rules and norms
 chhapemari ke baad team ne sample ikattha kar jaanch ke liye bheja he
 The hotel owner Arun Chopra denied all the allegations
 arun chopra ne kaha ki ye unke khilaaf sajeesh he
 13 ministers can be appointed in Haryana government; 2 ministers from JJP quota in Khattar cabinet are going to occupy power for the second time under the leadership of BJP Manohar Lal Khattar in Moukahariana
 haryana ke rajyapal satyadev narayan arya manohar laal khatter ko mukhyamantri pad kii or jejepi pramukh dushyant chautaala dipti siem pad kii shapath dilaayenge
 Manohar Khattar cabinet can have 13 ministers, out of which 2 ministers can be inducted from JJP quota
 anil vij jaise puraane netaa ke saath-saath kai yuva or nae chehre ko mauka mil saktaa he
 Possible faces of Manohar Lal Khattar's cabinet
 
 
 anil vijabijepi ke jeetne vaale vidhayakon main vij sabase zyada varisht hai
 This time it will be a compulsion for the government to place Anil Vij after the Chief Minister in order of seniority
 bade-bade maamalon main anil vij pradesh sarkaar ke liye sankatmochak sabit hue hai
 Whenever the opposition tries to surround the government on any issues, only Anil Vij is pushed forward
 iske saath hi varishthata main bhi anil vij sabase senior vidhayak hai
 He contested from Ambala Cantt seat 7 times and won 6 times
 aise main cabinet main unki seat tay maani ja rahi he
 He was also the Minister of Health, Sports and Youth Ministries in the previous cabinet
 ghanashyam sarracenil vij ke badaghanashyam sarrapaka number aata he
 However, in the previous government, Ghanshyam Sarraf was rejected by the BJP
 pehle mantri banane ke baad baad main unase mantri pad chin liya gaya tha
 Along with him another minister was also removed from the post of minister
 lekin ghanashyam sarraf wo duusare mantri hai jo anil vij kii hi tarah jeet kar aae hai
 In such a situation, his seat is also considered to be fixed
 kyonki in donon mantriyon ke alaava anya tamaam mantri apane-apane ilaakon se chunaav haar gaye hai
 Sandeep Singh, a hockey player Sandeep Singh may also be among the mlas elected from sports quota in Sandeep Singh Haryana elections
 sandip singh charchit yuva cheharaa hai
 Also, after Babita Phogat and Yogeshwar Dutt lost in the elections, they are the only players who have proved their supremacy in their first battle in politics
 abhaya singh yadavanangal choudhary se lagaataar duusari baar vidhayak bane purv iees abhaya singh yadav ko bhi mantri pad hasil ho saktaa he
 Abhay Yadav has administrative experience and has also been elected for the second time
 punjabi cote se thanesaravidhayak subhash sudhaa or seemaa trikhaamein se ek mantri banane kii line main hai
 Sudha is close to Manohar Lal and has also defeated veteran Congress leader and former state president of INLD Ashok Arora
 inke alaava haryana main is baar nirdaleey vidhayakon ko bhi sarkaar ko sadhana padegaa
 So one or two independents will also have to be given the ministerial position
 kanvarpal gurjar2014 kii vidhansabha main adhyaksh pad par rahe kanvarpal gurjar kii bhi mantri banane kii teevr ichha he
 In the previous government too, he was craving for the post of minister, but he was given the responsibility of the post of speaker
 is baar wo phir jitkar aae hai
 Therefore, the government will also have to represent Yamunanagar by making him a minister, as Yamunanagar is one of the districts of Haryana where there is less representation
 vaisya chehron main se ek par meharbaani rahegi
 After the assembly elections Sudhir Singla, Narendra Gupta, Drs
 camel gupta, gyaan chand gupta or deepak mangala ke naam kii charchaa he
 Narendra Gupta won from Faridabad after being cut from former minister Vipul Goyal's ticket
 jabaki dow
 Kamal Gupta became MLA from Hisar for the second time
 panchakula se gyaan chand gupta bhi duusari baar vidhayak bane hai
 Deepak Mangla is said to be the man of choice of CM
 aise main lottery kiski lagegi ye kahana mushkil he
 Jat faces will be among the big Jat leaders like Subhash Barala, Captain Abhimanyu and Om Prakash Dhankhar in Haryana and all those who have been ministers in the previous cabinet have lost elections
 aise main mahipal dhanda, kamalesh dhanda, jepi dalal or praveen dagar jaise jat chehre chunaav jite hai
 It would be a compulsion to make one of these faces a minister because they are Jat faces who won on the party ticket
 nirdaleey vidhayakon main se hooda ke garh maham se jitkar aae balraj kundu kaa naam sabase upar he
 Apart from this, the names of Randhir Golan won from Pundri and Ranjit Singh who won from Raniyan are also discussed
 jisamen se kam se kam 2 mantri ban sakate hai
 The rest of the independents can also be pacified by giving the post of Chairman
 pichde varg se sarkaar main indri se ramkumar kashyap kaa naam aage chal rahaa he
 Kashyap, who was a Rajya Sabha MP from INLD, was included in the BJP by Manohar Lal Khattar
 ab unhen mantri pad se nawaja ja saktaa he, kyonki ve pichde varg se aate hai
 Karna Dev Kamboj was a minister in the previous government, he was also from Indri but lost the election this time, so Kashyap can be given the representation of Indri

 rajdhani dilli main prastaavit hunkaar raily se pehle hi vivaad ho gaya tha
 The Delhi Police did not approve Mevani's rally on Parliament Street citing the order of the NGT
 dilli police ne bataaya ki mewaani ko ramlila maidan main raily karne ko kaha gaya tha

 PM has to tell why till now 15 lakh rupees have not come in the account? Why do the youth have no employment? Why farmers were killed in Mandsaur? Violence is their weapon, we want a peaceful movement: Kanhaiya Kumar: Former president of JNUSU Kanhaiya Kumar said that we do not want violence, we want a peaceful movement
 hinsa unka hathiyaar he, hamen kisi bhi tarah se hinsak nahin hona he
 We are not against any religion
 ham yahaan samanta ke liye aae hai
 i want to ask the BJP whether it wants Ravana Raj or Ram Rajya? Media is the fourth pillar of democracy, but it is also being targeted
 ham unke saath khadey hai
 Kanhaiya further said that BJP is not a washing machine, weakening democracy
 pyaar kii raajnneeti he, badale kii nahin: prashanth bhushnamevani kii raily main prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki dilli police ne raily rokane ke liye parmishan nahin di
 Hence the crowd is less, but a new beginning
 desh main ek nai ummid jaagi he, ek juthi raajnneeti ke khilaaf ek takat khadi ho rahi he
 How far it will reach next, it has to be seen
 yah pyaar kii raajnneeti he, na ki badale kii raajnneeti
 Modi cannot carry the bag, questions have to be answered: Omar Khalid Omar Khalid while talking about Rohit Vemula and Chandrasekhar said that PM Narendra Modi says that he will pick up the bag and go away, but he will not answer our questions can not go
 ab koi eklavya nahin ki aap angootha kaat lenge
 The truth is that Chandrasekhar is not a threat to the country, but a threat to the concept of Hindu Rashtra
 umr khalid ne aage kaha ki siem yogi ne daliton ko jaakar shempu or sabun baanten, yah daliton kaa apmaan he or isi ke khilaaf chandrashekhar ladaai lard rahe hai
 The government could not face Rohit and forced him to Suicide
 sarkaar ne sochaa ki use udhaaharan banaakar hamen daraa denge, lekin ham yah ladaai jeetenge or rohit ko insaaf dilaayenge
 You can hate me, Jignesh Mevani, but it will not create jobs
 isse sirf aapkaa blad pressure badhegaa
 According to Omar Khalid the noise of the TV channel does not show the correct picture
 saadhe teen saal pehle modi lahar ke khilaaf koi vipaksh nahin tha
 Now there is opposition, its credit goes to the movement of youth, women, farmers and people

 Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary said in the House that Pakistan sheltered terrorists and China sheltered Pakistan
 china ne andaman or nicobar tak jahaaj bhejne shuru kar die hai
 When it comes to Pakistan, we have an aggression in our voice but why are we being soft towards China? Let us say, in the last few years the incidents of espionage in the Indian Ocean by Chinese naval ships have increased but the Indian Navy has Keeping an eye on such activities
 bengal kshetra ke nausena ke prabharee adhikari comodor suprabho de ne mangalvaar ko bataaya ki hind mahaasaagar main kuch pramukh kshetra hai jisase nausena ko kshetra main chal rahi gatividhiyon par najar rakhane main madad milti he

 In Thane, Maharashtra, a sensational case of gang-raping a 16-year-old girl and uploading her pornographic video on social media has come to light
 peedita ke parijanon kii taharir par police ne teen aropiyon ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 376 or poxo act ke tahat cese darj kar liya he
 The three accused have been arrested
 police nireekshak arun phegade ne bataaya ki teenon aaropee thane jile ke shahpur taluk ke ek gaanv ke nivasee hai
 It is alleged that the three accused forcibly took the minor girl to the nearby forest
 vahaan baari-baari se uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 This incident is from November last year, but the family of the victim has now registered a case in this case on February 9
 police ne bataaya ki darj karai gai shikaayat ke aadhaar par dhanji patil (23), bharat walimbe (24) or nitin patil (22) ko 10 farvari ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 One of the accused recorded the incident on mobile and uploaded it on social media
 unhen 15 farvari tak nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya he
 Let us tell you that another such incident of gang-rape was reported in Thane itself, which made the friendship embarrassing
 yahaan do yuvakon ne apni hi dost ke saath gangrape kiya or saboot mitaane ke liye uski hatya kar di thi
 The father of the deceased is an Assistant Police Inspector in Nagpur Police
 police ne teen aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya tha
 The 22-year-old resident of Nagpur was doing an internship in an IT company after completing his engineering degree
 aropiyon main se ek mritka kaa parichit tha
 Nilkesh Patil studied engineering in Nagpur with the deceased
 ravivaar ko patil apane dost neelesh khobragade ke saath nagpur se pune pahunchaa, jahaan ladki se mulaakaat hui
 The accused took him to Ambernath on the outskirts of Mumbai
 vahaan do aropiyon ne ladki ke saath rape kiya
 When the girl threatened to complain to the police, she killed her
 iske baad aropiyon ne ladki ke shav ko ek suutakes main bhar diya
 Threw in suitcase drains line
 police poochtacha main aropiyon ne apana jurm kabool kar liya tha
 Neither there is a ban on taking the name of Ram nor on the procession of Ram Navami
 isse pehle ki kai zile jal uthe, yahaan ruk kar sawaal karnaa zaruri he ki kahin ramanavami ke naam par gaanv kasbon or chote shaharon main sampradiyakataa kaa unmaad failaane kaa prayaas to nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 In these processions, Ram ji's slogans seem to be less, political slogans have started becoming more
 netaaon ko lagata he ki isse pehle ki log rojgaar, aspataal ke sawaal puuchhen, unako ram ke naam par rasta dikhaa do
 We have all seen Ram Navami, but why is it happening now that teenage boys have thick swords in their hands, political slogans in the name of devotion on their tongue
 jis tarah se ramanavami ke naam par koshish ho rahi he, use saaf-saaf nahin kaha gaya to pachhataane kaa bhi mauka nahin milegaa
 It is a matter of pride that in most places Hindus and Muslims have understood the politics being played under the guise of the procession and set the example of brotherhood, yet in this country there have been instances of burning of the city by throwing anything on anyone's procession
 bihar or bengal jis aag se guzara he wo media main nahin aa rahaa he, is ehtiyaat ke saath ki bhakthi kii aad main unmaad phir na faile
 But whatsapp University is doing a lot in the world
 aap hi bataaiye ki us samay ramanavami kaa juluus kii pavitrataa kya rah jaati he jab shobhaa yatra main ek hatyare kii jhaanki banaai jaati he
 Will we bring the worship of Rama to this level
 rajasthan ke jodhpur main ramanavami ke maukey par juluus niklaa, is juluus main 325 devi devataaon kii jhaankiyaan thim magar isamen isaki jhaanki kya kar rahi he
 Has this person become a god?whose murder trial is going on in jise bharat kii adaalat main hatya kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa he kya wo devataaon ke jhaanki ke bich jagah paaegaa
 You must have remembered ye jhaanki hatya ke us aaropee kii he jisane beete disambar main ek muslim mazdoor kii nrushans hatya kii, phir uske shav ko jalaayaa or is sabakaa video soshal media par daalaa
 Love declared a champian to stop jihad, after this, on different websites of websites, he tried to call himself the Hindu heart emperor
 shambhulaal raigar naam kaa ye aadmi ab jail main he lekin baahar is tarah uski jhaanki nikali
 a man made his appearance sat on a throne and held an ax in his hand
 saamne zamin par ek duusare aadmi ko pitate hue dikhaaya gaya
 The procession belonged to Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the tableau was formed by a Shiv Sena worker
 kya yah zaruri tha, kya ram ji kii paant main aise log baithenge, sochie ek baar
 What level are we reaching? jo yuvak is jhaanki main shambhulaal bana uskaa naam suresh he or wo tees saal kaa he
 Unemployed, does electrical work and for 500 rupees he became a Shambhulal regar as his face resembles him
 lekin hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh se baatcheet main usne kaha ki wo shivasena kaa hissaa nahin he, usne paise ke liye ye kaam kiya
 Think it worked with money
 magar iske aisa karne se yaa isse aisa karwaane kise chunauti di ja rahi thi jab is sawaal par sochenge to pataa chalegaa ki niyat kuch or he
 Harsha told that when there was a dispute about this tableau, this young man was doing something else
 shaayad vah bhi apane liye is unmaad main jagah bana rahaa tha
 The attitude of the leaders of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the organization that organized the procession, looked similar
 wo kah rahe hai ki shanbhu abhi doshi nahin he magar jail main to he
 So will they accept him as Krishna
 kya unhen uske reeha hone kaa intazaar nahin karnaa chahie, kya unhone shanbhu kaa video nahin dekha hoga jisamen wo hatya kar rahaa he
 In the procession of Ramnavami, the tableaux of Lord Rama and Sita and other Gods and Goddesses are taken out, but this tableau of Jodhpur was seen teasing that tradition, provoking people in the name of religion
 shanbhu laal raigar ne khud ko lav jihad ke kilaaf ek yoddha bataane kii koshish kii thi or is jhaanki main bhi vahi koshish phir dikhi
 Recently, another video of the same Shambhu Lal Raigar came out in which he was trying to incite people in the name of Hinduism while sitting in jail
 uksaane bhadakaane vaale har jagah sakriy ho rahe hai
 They are just looking for opportunities
 pashchim bengal main bhi dharm ke naam par logon ko baantne kii siyasat apane charam par he
 Holy festivals like Ram Navami are becoming an occasion for those who provoke people
 bengal ke raniganj kii hill basti main yahi hua
 Temple-mosques have been around here for years and such fanaticism has never been seen here in the name of religion, but this time a procession of Ramavanmi passed through Muslim-dominated area, violence started between two groups
 dekhte hi dekhte kuch dukaanon ko aag laga di gai
 One villager was killed in the violence, three policemen were injured
 hinsa karne waalon ne kai motorcykilon ko aag laga di or sthaneey bazaar main pulisavaalon par hamalaa kiya
 DCP Arindam Dutta Chaudhary of asansol-durgapur was injured in the violent incident
 dangaiyon ke phenke ek bam se unka ek haath chalaa gaya
 His condition in the hospital remains stable
 ghatana ke baad dare hue kai log ilaaka chhodkar ja rahe hai
 The whole matter is like a formula
 sthaneey str par tanaav ko bhadakaana or phir use bahes or bayaanbazi ke zarie bade str par le janaa taaki charchaa ke naam par logon kaa kharchaa chalata rahe
 The players of this game know that anything can be done by taking the name of Ram
 bahes jiti ja sakati he yaa haarane par is shart par jiti ja sakati he ki kya is desh main ram kaa naam lenaa gunaah he
 But the intention behind the method is to watch it carefully
 bengal ke purulia main bhi ramanavami ke maukey par nikle juluus ke baad jhadap shuru ho gai
 One man was killed and five policemen were injured in the clash
 police ke mutabik sarkaar kii pabandi ke baavjood bijepi samarthakon ne kai jagah talavaarein haath main lekar juluus nikaale
 An armed mob entered the police station on the occasion of Ram Navami in Kandi, Murshidabad
 police ko javaabi karrwai main lathicharge kar ugr bheed ko vahaan se bhagaanaa padaa
 a puja pandal was attacked on the occasion of Ram Navami in Bardhaman
 ramanavami vaise pashchim bengal main kabhi bada tyohaar nahin rahaa lekin beete do saal se bijepi or usase jude sanghathan is maukey par apni upasthiti darj karaane main koi kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 On the other hand, communal clashes took place on Monday afternoon in Aurangabad, Bihar after the Ram Navami procession
 tippaniyan It was told that the procession of Ramnavmi was stoned in Nawadih area of the city after which the violence started
 hinsa ke dauraan old jiti road par qareeb pachaas dukaanon ko dangaiyon ne aag laga di
 More than sixty people were injured in these violent clashes, including twenty policemen who were injured in stone pelting
 hinsa rokane ke liye police ko dekhte hi goli maarane ke aadesh die gaye or ilaake main karfue laga diya gaya
 There was tension here on Tuesday, even though the curfew was lifted
 phir bhi kaafii kam hi log sadakon par utre
 There was no untoward incident due to heavy deployment of security forces
 aurangabad kii hinsa main bijepi ke sthaneey saansad susheel singh kii bhoomika sandigdh bataai ja rahi he jo kriya kii pratikriya kii baat kar rahe hai
 This is what i call Hindu Muslim Debate
 taaki maahaul garam rahe
 The debate continued
 ramanavami kii shubhakamanaayen, ram ke naam par jo yah sab kiya ja rahaa he, uske liye shubhakamanaayen bilkul nahin
 a procession took place on the occasion of Ram Navami in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, in this procession there were tableaux of 325 deities but what is its tableau in it
 kya yah shaks devtaa ho gaya he
 Whose murder trial is going on in the court of India, will he find a place among the tableaux of the gods
 aapako yaad aa hi gaya hoga
 The tableau is that of a murder accused who brutally murdered a Muslim laborer in December, then burnt his body and put a video of it all on social media
 lav jihad rokane kaa champiyan ghoshit kar daalaa, iske baad alag alag naam kii websites par khud ko hindu hriday samraat bataane kii koshish kii
 This man named Shambhulal Raigar is now in jail but his tableau came out like this
 ek aadmi uski shakl banaakar ek singhaasana par baitha or haath main kulhadi pakadi
 Another man was shown beating on the ground
 juluus vishwa hindu parishad kaa tha or jhaanki shivasena ke ek kaaryakarta ne banavaai
 Was it necessary, would such people sit in Ram ji's pant, think once
 ham kis str par pahunch rahe hai
 The young man who became Shambhulal in this tableau is named Suresh and he is thirty years old
 berojgaar he, bijli kaa kaam karata he or 500 rupye ke liye wo shambhulaal raigar ban gaya kyonki uski shakl usase milti he
 But in a conversation with our colleague Harsha Kumari Singh, he said that he is not a part of Shiv Sena, he did this work for money
 sochie paise lekar yah to kaam kar gaya
 But who was being challenged by doing this or doing this, when we think on this question, then you will know that the intention is something else
 harsha ne bataaya ki jab is jhaanki lekar vivaad hone laga, to ye noujvaan kuch or hi kar rahaa tha
 Perhaps he too was making a place for himself in this frenzy
 julus kaa aayojan karne vaali sanstha vishwa hindu parishad ke netaaon ke bhi tevar aise hi dikhe
 They are saying that Shambhu is not guilty yet but is in jail
 to kya use wo krishna maan lenge
 Should they not wait for his release, should he not have seen the video of Shambhu in which he is committing murder
 ramanavami ke juluus main bhagwaan ram or sita or saath main anya devi devataaon kii jhaankiyaan nikaali jaati hai lekin jodhpur kii ye jhaanki us parampara ko munh chidhaati dikhi, logon ko dharm ke naam par uksaati dikhi
 Shambhu Lal Rager had tried to describe himself as a warrior against love jihad and the same effort was seen again in this tableau
 pichley dinon isi shanbhu laal raigar kaa ek or video saamne aayaa tha jisamen wo jail main baitha hindu dharm ke naam par logon ko uksaane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 Inciting instigators are becoming active everywhere
 wo bas maukey dhund rahe hai
 In West Bengal too, the politics of dividing people in the name of religion is at its peak
 ramanavami jaise pavitra parv logon ko bhadakaane waalon ke liye ek mauka ban rahe hai
 This is what happened in the hill settlement of Raniganj in Bengal
 yahaan saalon se mandir - masjid aasapaas rahe hai or dharm ke naam par yahaan kabhi aisi kattarta nahin dekhi gai lekin is baar ramvanami kaa ek juluus muslim bahul ilaake se kya guzara, do guton ke bich hinsa shuru ho gai
 Some shops were set on fire immediately
 hinsa main ek gaanvvaale kii maut ho gai, teen pulisavaale ghayal ho gaye
 Violents set several motorcycles on fire and attacked policemen in the local market
 hinsak ghatana main asanasol-durgapur ke disipi arindam datta choudhary ghayal ho gaye
 One of the rioters lost his hand with a bomb
 aspataal main unki haalat sthir bani hui he
 Scared after the incident, many people are leaving the area
 sara maamla ek formule kii tarah hota he
 To incite tension at the local level and then to take it to a greater level through debate and rhetoric so that the expenses of the people in the name of discussion continue
 is khel ke khilaadiyon ko pataa he, ram kaa naam lekar kuch bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The debate can be won or won on the condition that it is a crime to name Ram in this country
 magar jo tarika he uske peeche kii niyat he use saavdhaanee se dekhie
 The clashes started in Purulia in Bengal after a procession that took place on the occasion of Ram Navami
 is jhadap main ek aadmi kii maut ho gai or paanch pulisavaale ghayal ho gaye
 According to the police, despite the government's ban, BJP supporters took out a procession with swords in many places
 murshidaabad ke kandi main bhi ramanavami ke maukey par ek hathiyaarband bheed police thane main ghus gai
 Police had to lathi-charge in retaliation and drive away the mob
 bardhaman main ramanavami ke maukey par ek puja pandal par hamalaa hua
 Ram Navami has never been a big festival in West Bengal, but for the last two years, BJP and its associated organizations are leaving no stone unturned to mark their presence on this occasion
 udhar bihar ke aurangabad main ramanavami ke juluus ke baad somvaar dopaher sampradayik jhadpen huin
 The comments bataaya gaya ki ramanavami ke juluus par shahar ke navadih ilaake main patharbazi kii gai jiske baad hinsa shuru hui
 Around fifty shops on Old GT Road were set on fire by rioters during the violence
 in hinsak jhadpon main saath se zyaada log ghayal ho gaye jinamein bees pulisavaale bhi shaamil hai jo patharbazi main ghayal hue
 Police were ordered to shoot and curfew was imposed in the area to stop the violence
 mangalvaar ko bhi yahaan tanaav bana hua tha haalanki karfue uthaa liya gaya
 Yet very few people took to the streets
 suraksha balon kii baari tainaati ke kaaran koi apriy ghatana nahin hui
 The role of local BJP MP Sushil Singh in the violence in Aurangabad is being dubbed as a reaction to the action
 isi ko main hindu muslim dibet kahata hum
 So that the atmosphere is warm
 bahes chalati rahe
 Best wishes to Ramnavami, no good wishes for all that is being done in the name of Rama
 kya yah zaruri tha, kya ram ji kii paant main aise log baithenge, sochie ek baar
 What level are we reaching? jo yuvak is jhaanki main shambhulaal bana uskaa naam suresh he or wo tees saal kaa he

 The Tis Hazari court of Delhi, while giving the verdict on Sanger's sentence at 2 pm on Friday, also announced a fine of Rs 25 lakh
 kuldeep senger ko court ne sajaa sunai to usne jaj ke saamne haath jod liye
 Before that, Judge Dharmesh Sharma read the affidavits given by Kuldeep Sengar's lawyers and the case was debated
 senger ke dastavejon ke aadhaar par uski kul chal or achal sampatti 44 lakh rupee aanki gai he
 During the hearing, Sanger's lawyer said that its value has come down for the time being because the price of his car has come down
 iske alaava senger kii beti kaa medical main daakhila karaayaa gaya he, jisaki fees dene ke baad ye rakam or kam ho jaaegi
 At the same time, the victim's lawyer said that Unnao's victim's house was completely broken
 iske alaava peedita ke pita ke paas 3 bhaaiyon ke bich kul 3 bigha jameen he
 The victim's lawyer said that the MLA, not only to hide his crime, was forced to withdraw the case but also acted as a legislator
 agar desh ko chalaane vaale log jinpar janata kii raksha kaa daayitv he, wo aisa karenge to phir unako sazaa bhi adhiktam honi chahie
 In the Unnao case, Kuldeep Sengar pleaded guilty that Sanger was found guilty of kidnapping and rape
 sajaa par bahes ke dauraan sibiai ne court se adhiktam sajaa kii maang kii he
 On December 16, Delhi's Tis Hazari court convicted Sanger under Section 376 and Section 6 of Poxo
 jabaki 17 disambar ko sajaa par bahes kii gai thi
 After this, the court ordered Kuldeep Singh Sengar to give full details of his income and assets before the next hearing
 mangalvaar ko sunwaayee ke baad doshi vidhayak ko sajaa sunaane ke liye court ne 20 disambar yani shuukravaar kaa din tay kiya tha
 The court said that day that he did not want to make any hasty decision
 unnav rape cond jaghanya sajeesh, hatya or durghatnaon se bharaa hua he
 So let's have a look at this whole issue
 naukari, mulaakaat or balaatkaarunnav ke bangaramau se vidhayak kuldeep singh senger se milane ke liye unke ghar ke kareeb rahane vaali ek 17 varshiya kishori ek mahila ke saath 4 june 2017 ko naukari maangane ke liye pahunchi thi
 The woman who went there with the teenager
 uskaa naam tha shashi singh
 She was close to Sanger
 usee ke baad achaanak ek din us kishori ne khulaasa kiya ki vidhayak ne uske saath balaatkaar kiya he
 The girl and her family kept going around the police station
 adhikariyon se guhaar lagaate rahe, lekin koi sunwaayee nahin hui
 Eventually he took court
 tab jaakar police ne maamla darj kiya
 After this, a series of excesses started on the teenager's family
 ladki par lagaataar samjhaute kaa dabaav banaaya ja rahaa tha
 He was being asked to withdraw the lawsuit
 lekin ye maamla media kii surkhiyon main aa gaya
 The police of the state were doing a scuffle in the investigation against the MLA of the ruling party
 ladki ke parivaar ko dhamka rahi thi
 But the victim did not leave justice
 maamla jab tool pakadaney laga to april 2018 main jaanch sibiai ke hawaale kar di gai
 At the same time, the CBI team called the accused BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar for questioning
 adhikariyon ko bhi daal main kaala najar aa rahaa tha
 Then the Allahabad High Court took cognizance of the case giving huge relief to the victim and ordered the CBI to immediately arrest the accused MLA
 sibiai ne alag se praathmiki darj kii or senger ko giraftaar ke baad ek saptaah ke liye nyaayik hiraasat main rakhaa gaya
 There was increasing public anger over the matter
 lihaaja sibiai kii team bhi teji se kaam kar rahi thi
 The CBI confirmed the rape allegation of the victim after investigation
 aaropee vidhayak ke khilaaf bhartiya dand samhita or yon aparaadhon se bacchon ke sangrakshan kii 4 dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya
 Murder and attempt to murder In this case, first the MLA Sengar's brother Atul beaten the victim's father brutally, then implicated him in false cases under the conspiracy and sent him to the police station
 jahaan unki hatya kar di gai
 Atul was arrested much later in this case
 jab vidhayak senger jail chalaa gaya, tab bhi wo apni harkaton se baj nahin aayaa
 He kept plotting against the victim and his family even while in jail
 28 july 2019 ko, peedita ke apane chachaa, chachee or vakil ke saath unki car main cese ke silsile main yatra kar rahi thi
 Then his car was hit by a truck on the highway
 jisase peedita ke parijanon kii maut ho gai, jabaki wo or unke vakil gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaye
 In this case, Sengar was booked for murder, attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy and criminal intimidation
 exiaar main senger ke bhai manoj singh senger, shashi singh or unke sahyogiyon sahit 10 logon ko namjad kiya gaya
 Expulsion from BJP: In this case top BJP leaders first tried to save Kuldeep Singh Sengar
 yahi nahin jail main band hone par bhi senger lagaataar netaaon se mil rahaa tha
 He kept trying in every way to protect himself
 lekin jab ye maamla deshbhar main chaaya or log sadakon par utar aae
 When the opposition began to surround the Yogi government, the BJP suspended it from the party
 agast 2019 main bade paimaane par bijepi kii upi sarkaar ko saarvajanik or raajnneetik aakrosh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 However, Sanger was not disqualified as an MLA even after suspension and subsequent expulsion
 unnav rape cond ke peeche he 18 saal puraani dushmaniunnav rape cond kii peedita ke parivaar or aaropee vidhayak kuldeep senger ke bich dushmani kaa rishta 18 saal purana he
 This is the reason why the blame of the victim's aunt and aunt's death is also on the head of MLA Sengar
 isse pehle peedita ke taaoo, phir pita kii maut ke liye bhi vidhayak ko hi zimmedaar tehraaya gaya tha
 Even MLA Sengar is accused of hatching a conspiracy to implicate the victim's uncle in an attempt to murder
 is maamle main supreme court ke kade faisle ke baad ab har koi jaananaa chahta he ki aakhir 18 saal pehle peedita ke parivaar or vidhayak ke bich ranjish shuru kaise hui thi? ham aapako bataate hai
 Actually, the story begins with Makhi village in Unnao district
 makhi gaanv ke sarai thok mohalla main aaropee vidhayak kuldeep singh senger or peedit ladki kaa ghar he
 There is a gap of about 50 steps between the two houses
 kahani main ham aapako kuch saal peeche lekar chalate hai
 Three brothers used to live in Sarai Thok Mohle of Makhi village
 teenon bhai ilaake main dabang ke taur par jane jate the
 Many different cases were also filed on these
 peedita ke taaoo kii kareeb 15 saal pehle gaanv main hi peet-peet kar hatya kar di gai thi
 The victim's uncle is currently lodged in Rae Bareli jail
 usee se milane ke liye ravivaar ko peedita jail ja rahi thi
 While Pappu Singh was the victim's father
 jinaki vidhayak ke bhai or uske gurgon ke haathon pitayee ke baad 2017 main maut ho gai thi
 That is, both the tau and father of the victim girl have been killed
 jabaki peedita kaa chachaa hatya kii koshish ke ek maamle main raibareli kii jail main das saal kii sajaa kaat rahaa he
 And the same uncle's wife and sister-in-law have also died in the same road accident, about which many doubts and questions are arising
 ab yahaan jo sabase ahm baat he wo ye ki ek taaoo kii maut ko chhod den to baaki har maut or chachaa ke jail jane ko lekar sidhe ungali vidhayak kuldeep singh senger kii taraf uth rahi he
 Even the charge of rape is the same
 or ab is sadak haadase kaa shaq usee par ja rahaa he
 But why? Why did an entire family disintegrate in about a decade and a half? Is there any old rivalry between the rape victim's girl and the mla's family? If yes, then what is the story? tab se pehle tak kuldeep singh senger or peedit ladki ke taaoo, chachaa or pita se kuldeep singh senger kii khub banati thi
 Everyone had to come to each other's house
 khaanaa-pinaa tha
 In 2002, when Kuldeep Singh Sengar was contesting the assembly for the first time, the victim's tau, uncle and father helped Sengar to win the election
 magar pehali baar vidhayak banane ke baad kuldeep singh senger ne achaanak teenon bhaaiyon se kinaaraa karnaa shuru kar diya
 After this, a rift started between the two families
 dhire-dhire ye daraar aapasi ranjish main badal gai
 Meanwhile, the election of village head has come
 tab senger ko sabak sikhaane ke liye peedit ladki ke taaoo ne khud pradhani kaa chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 On the other hand, Chunni Devi, mother of legislator Sengar, was contesting for Pradhani
 tab pehali baar tha, jab donon parivaar aamane-saamne the
 However, just before the election, Kuldeep Singh Sengar rejected the candidature of the victim by arming the tau's lawsuits
 lihaaza ab uski jagah uske kareebi devendra singh kii maa ko chunaav main utaar diya gaya
 During this election campaign, there was a clash between the victim's family and the Sanger family
 baad main vidhayak senger kii taraf se police ne mahesh singh ke khilaaf hatya kii koshish kaa maamla darj kiya tha
 The first murder in the mutual enmity between these two families was the victim's tau
 gaanv main hi kuch logon ne eent-pattharon se hamalaa kare use maar diya tha
 The charge of plotting his assassination was then imposed on MLA Kuldeep Sengar
 bhai kii maut ke fouran baad peedit ladki kaa chachaa unnav chhod kar gaayab ho gaya
 Then after nearly 17 years in 2018, he was caught close to Delhi and now in the same case he is serving a ten-year sentence in Rae Bareli jail
 4 june 2017 ko 17 varshiya peedita ne ilzaam lagaaya ki vidhayak senger ne apane ghar par uski asmat luti
 After this charge, Atul Singh, brother of MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his associates handed over the victim's father to the police after beating him badly
 tab peedita ke pita ne kaha bhi tha ki unhen farji maamle main fansaaya ja rahaa he
 But the police still filed a lawsuit of Arms Act and sent him to jail
 jahaan do din baad hi unki maut ho gai
 This was the second death in a feud between the two families
 or ab peedit parivaar ke parivaar main do or maut ho gai
 One aunt and the other aunt's sister
 chachee bhi is maamle main vidhayak senger ke khilaaf ahm gavaah thim
 While the condition of the victim girl remains critical
 zaahir he maamla sirf rape tak nahin he
 Rather, it is a case of the destruction of a whole family and its destruction
 is puure cese kii jad vidhayak kuldeep singh senger kaa naam aata he

 ) bihar main dalit politics ek nai karavat le rahi he
 And this upheaval has started by Jeetan Ram Manjhi
 rajya main dalit votbank kii politics ramvilas paswan kar rahe the
 But Manjhi not only went a step ahead of him, but with his political decisions, he wrote a new chapter in Bihar
 nateeja yah hua ki digar partiyon ke netaa bhi unase prabhavit hai, or unke faislon se utsahit hai
 Especially Pappu Yadav and Ramai Ram
 jediu or argedy main bahut se netaa hai, jinhen agle chunaav main apni partiyon kii haalat patali dikh rahi he
 Especially after the Manjhi episode
 rashtriya janata dal ke saansad pappu yadav ne to is vivaad kii shuruyaat main hi kah diya tha ki maanjhi ko hataanaa sidhe bijepi ko nimantran dena hoga
 They have understood that the politics of Bihar revolves around the poor and minorities
 ab tak bihar main dalit mukhyamantri na hona khatak nahin rahaa tha
 But when someone is made, it will be politically dangerous to remove
 yadav ab daliton ko apni ore modane ke liye kah rahe hai ki koi bhi party dalit netaa pasand nahin karti
 It is reported that he may send his resignation to Lalu Yadav soon
 ye kayaas hi sahi, lekin ho saktaa he ki pappu yadav aane vaale chunaav se pehle bijepi main shaamil ho jaaen
 His wife Ranjit Ranjan, who is a Congress MP from Supaul, will open the way for him as well
 bihar ke ek or bade netaa hai ramai ram
 JDU MLA and minister in Nitish government
 lekin in dinon naaraaz hai
 After Nitish took over the office, all his ministers have started functioning, but Ramai Ram is not coming to office
 ve upmukhyamantri kaa pad maang rahe hai
 Ramai Ram has also previously served in the cabinet of Lalu Yadav and Rabri Devi
 maanjhi prakaran ke baad unka bhi aatmavishvaas badha he
 He was also the Transport Minister in the Manjhi government and Nitish has also given him the same ministry
 lekin ramai ram ko ab kuch bada chahie
 Like Manjhi, he is also a Mahadalit
 darasal, bihar main mahadalit kaa mudda kabhi utana garm nahin rahaa, jitna use maanjhi ne kar diya he
 He also showed his removal from the post of Chief Minister in the same way as if it is an insult to the Dalit
 phir kursi chhodane se manaa kar diya or ek ke baad ek aise faisle kiye jisase sabhi ke sameekaran bighad gaye
 1
 2008 main nitish kumaar ne dhai lakh mahadalit pariwaron ko teen decimal [1306 varg feet] bhoomi dene ko kaha, 50 hajaar ko mili bhi
 Manjhi increased it to five decimals
 2
 Manjhi narrowed the gap between Mahadalits and Dalits during the last term of his term
 paswan jati ko mahadalit ke rup main manyata dekar
 On this decision, Ram Vilas Paswan challenged Nitish that if he has the courage then he should show this decision of Manjhi by reversing
 3
 Manjhi had decided two months ago that SC and ST girl students will not be charged any fees during graduation
 mahila matadaataaon ke liye yah yojana jati vishesh ke liye dekhi ja rahi thi
 If Nitish Kumar cancels this decision, it can decide the Mahadalits against him
 4
 As Tola servant and development friend, Nitish Kumar had decided to keep Mahadalit's people, Manjhi decided to employ them for 25 years
 maanjhi ne bihar kii raajnneeti ko nai disha di he
 As the elections come, it may be possible that those who follow the path of Manjhi grow
 ye jediu or argedy ke liye buree khabar hogi

 Many social organizations have also opened a front against the sacrifice in the temple
 samajasevi swami agnivesh sahit kai pashu suraksha se jude sanghathanon ne abhi se hi ilaake main camp kar chuke hai
 These people say that the committee that conducts this puja has said many times not to sacrifice but each time they turn away from their promise
 bhale hi prashasan or samajasevi sanghathan bali ke rokane ke liye kai prayaas karte dikhte hai lekin aasthaa or vishwaas ke aage sabhi bebas najar aate hai
