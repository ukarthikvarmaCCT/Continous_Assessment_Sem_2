 Excerpts of the conversation: It took eight years to realize that it is necessary to stay in politics? Many years took a special preparation
 maine na rasta badla he, na waapas muda hum
 When we went to study in the year 2000, a new way, a new structure, went in search of a new fighter
 meraa nishkarsh yahi tha ki samaaj aage, satta peeche tabhi hoga swasth vikaas, samaaj peeche, satta aage, tab to hoga satyanaash
 i still hold on to that
 bauddhik, rachanaatmak, andolanaatmak kaamon kaa dhaancha taiyaar karnaa tha, vah ab ho gaya
 Then we wondered what could be done again to bring the gentleman power back to political values
 itane bade lakshya ke liye aapke paas dhaancha kya he?kul chah-saat sau sakriy samoohon kaa sampark or samvaad he
 It is an intellectual, creative and agitational work
 ganga or gaay ke bare main jagah-jagah in samoohon ko joda gaya
 If you have taken political steps, are all these organizations also with you now? See, Dr
 lohia kehete the ki fawda, vot or jail teenon alag baaten hai
 Who can run a shovel does not necessarily take away the vote
 maine dekha ki sabhi pramukh dal americaparast or alpsankhyakparast ho gaye hai
 All are cut off from values and issues
 satta kii apadhapi main giroh kii shakl paa chuke hai
 There is not much difference in the working style of Uma Bharti and Mayawati
 uma ji ke hi saath kyon gaye?bhaajash kii adhyaksh ne pehle hi ghoshnaa kar di thi ki unki party rashtriya swabhimaan andolan kii rajnatik shakha kii tarah kaam karegi
 The simple possibility of becoming pro-indian and poor is at the level of consideration in the BJP
 ve meraa sahyog chaahati hai
 If all the groups are included, a new experiment is possible in about 100 Lok Sabha constituencies
 dobaaraa raajnneeti main aana tha to aapane bhaajapa ko yah ichha jataai?meraa akalan he ki bhaajapa ab bhagava congress banakar rah gai he
 There is only a difference of nineteen and twenty from the Congress on the level of thought and character
 vah bhi utani hi amirparast he jitani ki congress
 There is no difference between the economic policies of the UPA and the NDA
 shri adwani ne sadan ke bheetar or baahar donon jagah kaha he ki nitiyaan samaan hai to adhik sahyog karnaa chahie
 One has a tandoor scandal and the other has a champagne scandal
 jab aisa he to bhaajapa kii taraf mudakar dekhne kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 But you have been in BJP for a long time
 uske raah se bhatakane kaa kaaran kya he?yah baat 1991 se saaf hone lagi thi
 Those who were the decision makers believed that a party based on ideology and idealism could never come to power
 atal ji or adwani ji maanate the or maanate hai ki sansadeey vyavastha main sansadeey dal sarvopari he, sanghathan to ek sahaayak kaa kaam karegaa
 Secondly, they believe that if ideology is compromised, this can happen if they come to power
 varanaa sirf dabaav samooh banakar rah jaaenge
 Therefore, it was his destiny to become the saffron Congress
 yah sab sangh kaa niyantran rahane ke baad bhi hota gaya?dekhie, sangh kaa niyantran to naitik niyantran hota he
 In 1999–2000 there was serious discussion about what could be done
 tay hua ki marammat hi kii jaani chahie
 That is why during the period of his stay in the government, the disgust that the BJP got, the splash on the Sangh also fell
 kaha ja rahaa he ki bhaajash ke liye aap vaise kaam karenge jaise bhaajapa ke liye sangh?sangh ek athulaneey or anupam sanghathan he
 It has prepared millions for the service of the country, of which 90 percent are still away from power politics
 main sangh se tulana karun, yah bahut bachakaani baat hogi
 i am doing my work
 aapke or sanjay joshi ke prakaran se laga ki bhaajapa main ek varg he jo sangh kii reeti-niti ke logon ko party main chalane nahin dena chahta?sanjay ji kaa maamla mujhe zyada pataa nahin he
 But there is a duality in BJP
 vah 1970 se hi shuru hota he
 There should have been a development of such a system in which even a person of common moral ground can run directly and the system should be such that he can defend it
 yah na ho paanaa bhaajapa kii mul samasya rahi he
 That is why ad hocism, high command culture, spoon culture, then patronizing the parikrama except might, selling tickets, dynasty, giving criminals tickets to win - all these disorders came in BJP because electoral victory is the only goal
 aise main bhaajapa kaa bhavishya kya dekhte hai aap?ek or rajnatik giroh ke naate uski sthiti bani rahegi
 Just like today Congress is far away from Gandhi, Samajwadi Party is far away from Lohia, Marxist Party is far away from Marx, Bahujan Samaj Party is far away from Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram's dreams, in the same way, BJP is also Dr
 headgavar or dinadayal se bahut dur ho gai he
 Can the Sangh disassociate itself from the BJP? The general swayamsevak of the Sangh looks sad to me, at times indifferent and at times seems to go slowly with habitual flow
 kai chunaavon main sangh ke swayamsevakon kii sakriyata main kami isiilie aa rahi he
 Leaders of the second line in the BJP have come a long way
 unke netritv main kya sambhaavnaaen dikhti hai?lambey sambandhon ke kaaran atal ji or adwani ji main sangh ke prati gaharaa lagaav he
 New people cannot be said which of their feelings is selfish and which is dedication based
 ek badi netri ne ram mandir andolan ko ek aisa 'check' bataaya jo bhunaaya ja chukaa
 There is a General Secretary who gives hundreds of benefits to a foreign company during the recession as a lawsuit
 party adhyaksh hai jo sadhvi pragna ke bare main ek din kehete hai ki ve sirf parichit the or sharmindagi mahasoos karte hai, phir bolte hai ki teen baar narco test sehat ke liye thik nahin he
 There is a Chief Minister of Gujarat who has made an undertaking to break the temple
 yah sab hota he or pradhanmantri banane kii ichha rakhane vaale log chuppi saadhe rahete hai
 This causes credibility to fall
 adwani ji ne aapako peshkash nahin kii ki raajnneeti main aana he to bhaajapa main aaie?meri unase aakhri baatcheet 3 april, 2005 ko hui thi
 The BJP is excited that Advani will become the Prime Minister
 bahut bada tabaka tha swayamsevakon kaa jo 15 agast, 1998 ko atal ji ke lalakile par jhanda fahraane ke saath sapana saakaar hua dekh rahaa tha
 But the bombing of Pokhran was an achievement
 aap kaksha aath main fail ho gaye or dasvin kii pariksha main baithkar utsahit ho rahe hai
 As home minister, there was no difference between Advani and Shivraj Patil

 Describing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the world's biggest actor, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi said that better than this you would have made Amitabh Bachchan the Prime Minister
 unhone purvanchal ke mirzapur main congress pratyaashee lalitesh treepathi ke samarthan main road sho ke dauraan kaha ki aap samaj lijie ki aapane duniya ke sabase bade abhinayta ko apana piem bana diya he, isse acha to aap amitabh bachchan ko hi bana dete
 Priyanka's statement opened up the layers of relationships that had been buried for many years
 bachchan or gandhi parivaar kaa rishta dashakon purana he
 In this, Pandit remained close to members of Jawaharlal Nehru to Indira Gandhi and then to Rajiv Gandhi Bachchan family
 amitabh or rajeev kii dosti kisi se chuphi nahin he
 Amitabh's name is being searched for Priyanka Gandhi's Zumba during the election season amid discussions of sour relations in the relationship between Gandhi and Bachchan family for almost two decades
 vah bhi tab, jab congress ko lambey samay se cover karne vaale patrkaar rashid kidawai haal main dailyo
 In the report written on in, it has been claimed that Priyanka Gandhi decided to enter politics only with the blessings of Amitabh Bachchan
 unhone congress mahasachiv banane se pehle dilli main hui ek gopneey metig main amitabh bachchan se mulaakaat bhi kii thi
 She calls Amitabh as Mamu (maternal uncle)
 kitne kareebi rahe gandhi-bachchan parivargandhi or bachchan parivaar kii dosti elahabaad main anand bhawan ke jamaane se he
 When both families lived in Allahabad
 donon pariwaron ke bich mulaakaat kii kadi sarojini naidu bani thim
 He introduced Harivansh Rai Bachchan and his wife Teji Bachchan to Jawaharlal Nehru
 us vakt indira gandhi kii shaadi nahin hui thi
 After this, Bachchan and Gandhi family became very close to each other
 indira gandhi kii shaadi ke baad jab rajeev paidaa hue to baad main unki bhi dosti umr main do saal bade amitabh bachchan se hui
 In this way, this friendship kept progressing from generation to generation
 pradhanmantri rahete hue pandit jawahar laal nehru nai dilli ke teen murti bhawan main rahete the
 The doors of his house were always open to Rajiv's friend Amitabh and his brother Ajitabh
 teen murti bhawan main amitabh-ajitabh or rajeev gandhi-sajay gandhi ek duusare ke saath khelte the
 Relationships also intensified over time
 1983 main jab 'kuli' film kii shutig ke dauraan amitabh bachchan gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaye the, tab pradhanmantri rahete hue indira gandhi aspataal unka haalchaal lene pahunchi thim
 There are many stories in both the families
 magar ek udhaaharan or khaas he
 When Sonia Gandhi came to India before marriage, Indira Gandhi arranged for her stay with the Bachchan family
 darasal, indira gandhi kii manshaa thi ki isse videshi reeti-rivaajon main pali-badhin sonia ko hindustani sanskaar seekhney main aasaani hogi
 Sonia Gandhi was with the Bachchan family for nearly 43 days
 amitabh kii maa teji bachchan ne unhen beti kii tarah rakhte hue sabhi taur-tareeke sikhaye
 Thus Sonia also got mixed up in the Bachchan family
 kaise bigade rishte?gandhi or bachchan parivaar ke bich pragadh rishton main daraar padane ke peeche kai vajahen raheen
 Beginning with Emergency jab indira gandhi kathorta se tamaam niyam-kaayade lagu kar raheen thim
 It was also impacting Bollywood
 tab amitabh bachchan khamosh rahe the
 Upon which his criticism began
 is vakt amitabh bachchan ne gandhi parivaar se kuch had tak duuri banani shuru kar di thi
 However, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated, then the responsibility of running the Congress and the country fell on the shoulders of Rajiv Gandhi
 us vakt vipaksh ke mukaable ke liye rajeev gandhi ne apane celebrati dost amitabh bachchan ko raajnneeti main utaarne kaa manaa liya
 At the behest of Rajiv Gandhi, Amitabh Bachchan fought and won elections from Allahabad against veteran leader Hemwanti Nandan Bahuguna
 boforce ghotaale main aayaa namis bich boforce ghotaale ke mudde ko vipaksh ne jorshor se uthaanaa shuru kar diya
 Amitabh Bachchan's name also sprang into it
 is ghatana ne amitabh bachchan ko hilaakar rakh diya
 He also had to fight a legal battle
 boforce cond main naam uchhalane ke baad amitabh bachchan ne raajnneeti kii galiyon main bhatakane kaa khyaal chhod diya
 Journalist Rashid Kidwai's book 'leader-actor Bollywood Star Power in Indian Politics' also has many interesting stories recorded in one chapter about Bachchan and Gandhi family
 bataaya jaataa he ki 1991 main rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke baad sonia gandhi ko ummid thi ki bachchan parivaar se unhen sahaara milegaa, magar raajnneeti chhod chuke amitabh bachchan ke str se unhen nijee taur par bhi madad nahin mili
 Rashid Kidwai has mentioned in the book a major incident for the deteriorating relationship between the two families
 is ghatana ke mutabik 18 farvari 1997 main priyanka or robert wadra kii shaadi hone vaali thi
 But meanwhile, Amitabh Bachchan's daughter Shweta's wedding was fixed a day before on 17 February
 raashid kidawai ke mutabik congress main shaadi kii tithiyon ke ek din aage-peeche hone ko lekar khaasi charchaa rahi
 The worsening of the relationship between the two families became public when no member of the Gandhi family attended the funeral when Tej Bachchan died in 2007
 modi ke kareebi rahe amitabhagandhi parivaar se dur hone ke baad kabhi amar singh ke jariye bachchan parivaar samaajawaadee party ke kareeb aayaa
 Jaya Bachchan is still a Rajya Sabha MP from SP
 yun to amitabh bachchan kisi party se naata nahin rakhte hai
 But during Narendra Modi's time as Chief Minister in Gujarat, he did many advertisements as the brand ambassador of the state
 modi sarkaar ke do saal puure hone par 28 may 2016 ko india get par yojit kaarykram main bhi amitabh bachchan kii khaas maujuudagi dekhne ko mili thi
 This sent a message in the political corridor that there are many close ties between Big b and Narendra Modi

 Raghu Pandey, who came to the market from Bihar to buy old clothes, says that he washes these clothes and sells them back
 pandey ne kaha, ‘main pichley bees saal se is bazaar main aa rahaa hum

 ’unhone kaha, ‘agar main ek jeens sau rupee main kharidta hum to ise dhokar 130 rupayon main apane gaanv main bech detaa hum
 With this i earn enough money to raise my six-member family
 ’is bazaar kii asal umr ke bare main koi bhi nahin jaanata lekin varisht logon kaa daawa he ki yah lagbhag 70 saal purana he
 Jatin Sarkar of Tripura, who comes to this market once a month, said, 'no one can tell the real age of the market
 mere dada yahaan pachaas ke dashak ke shuruaati saalon main aate the
 'the operation in this market has been going on for years, but the shopkeepers coming from far flung areas are worried that there is no place to eat here
 murshidaabad ke abdul mondal ne kaha, ‘hamase dhan ekatra karne vaali bazaar kalyaan samiti ko kuch aahargrih banane ke liye kaha he lekin abhi tak hamaari is maang par koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 'no member of the Market Welfare Committee was available to answer this
 kolkata nagar nigam ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki unhen is bazaar ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin he
 Tarak Singh, an officer associated with the market (member of the Mayor in Council) said, "I am not aware of this market but now that you have told me, i will look into this matter

 Negligence is also such that he took away the life of one day innocent
 darasal ek jinda bachche ko aspataal prashasan ne mrit ghoshit kar diya lekin vah baccha jinda tha
 He died due to lack of timely treatment
 peedit maa ke mutabik, ravivaar subah usne safadarajang aspataal main ek bachche ko janm diya tha
 After some time, the doctors declared him dead
 bachche ke shav ko lekar vah log badarpur sthit apane ghar aa gaye
 As soon as he removed the cloth wrapped on the body of the child, he was stunned to see the movement in the child's body
 aspataal ne bataaya 40 hajaar roj kaa kharchanan-fanan main maa-baap bachche ko lekar najdiki apollo aspataal pahunche
 The cost of treatment there was told about 40 thousand rupees daily
 majaboor maa-baap yah kharch vahan nahin kar sakate the, lihaaja vah log ek baar phir safadarajang aspataal pahunche, jahaan maasoom kaa janm hua tha
 Seeing the child's breath moving, doctors started giving him oxygen immediately
 36 ghante baad haar gai jindagivo maasoom is duniya main aane ke kareeb 36 ghante tak maut se jang ladata rahaa

 unhone kaha ki gandhi kii mrityu ke baad patel ne khud hi kaha tha ki ab hamaare netaa nehru hai

 Anand Sharma said, 'today's conversation remained incomplete

 There was no serial conversation today

 After not talking to the opposition for 18 months, the government is now worried about talking to us on a bill
 sirf ek vidheyak ko lekar sarkaar ko itnaa pareshaan nahin hona chahie, kyonki anya mahatvapurn vidheyak bhi lambit hai
 Congress accused PM Modi: Congress leaders targeted Prime Minister Modi on this occasion and said that this bill could not be passed due to opposition of the then Chief Minister of Gujarat who is now the Prime Minister of the country for five years during the tenure of the UPA government

 ) Social worker Anna Hazare sat on Satyagraha at Rajghat on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti
 anna hajaare ne kaha ki 6 saal guzar jane ke baad bhi janalokapal nahin aa sakaa he
 Modi government has failed to curb corruption and is not serious about Jan Lokpal and Lokayukta
 anna hajaare ne kaha ki aam logon kii badahaali kaa kaaran sirf bhrashtachar he or agar sarkaar is disha main kadam nahin uthaati to disambar yaa agle saal janvari se phir ve sangharsh ke liye maidan main utrenge
 Anna Hazare said that the gap between poor and rich is widening due to corruption
 main 35 saal se andolan kar rahaa hum, ek bhi party aisi nahin he jiske khilaaf maine andolan nahin kiya
 Anna said that the RTI law we made has made a difference
 main 6 saal se lokapal kii ladaai lard rahaa hum, us sarkaar ne hamen aashwaasan bhi diya tha
 Anna said that the BJP supported the Lokpal while in opposition, but did nothing after being in power for three years
 anna ne kaha ki bharat kii aazaadee ke 70 saal guzar chuke hai, lekin hamaare swatantraaa senaniyon ke sapane abhi tak puraa nahin ho sake hai
 He said, i have come to greet Gandhiji at Rajghat
 aaj vyathit hone kaa ek kaaran he
 Anna said that i am not sad, unhappy people are selfish
 anna ne kaha, gandhi ji kaa jo sapana tha, vah puraa nahin hua
 Anna Hazare came to Delhi from Pune on Monday morning and reached Gandhi Samadhi Rajghat directly, where Anna Hazare paid tribute to Bapu
 anna hajaare ne ravivaar ko kaha tha ki desh mahatma gandhi ke sapane ke raste se bhatak gaya he
 That is why he will perform a day-long satyagraha on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti
 isi maddenjar somvaar ko anna hajaare gandhi samadhi par pahunchakar satyagrah shuru kiya
 In fact, in the past, Anna Hazare had written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing his displeasure over corruption and problems of farmers and also talked about agitation
 anna ne letters main likhaa tha ki unke andolan ke chah saal baad bhi bhrashtachar ko rokane vaale ek bhi kanoon par amal nahin ho paaya
 The government is showing slackness on all strong bills appointing Lokpal, Lokayukta and preventing corruption
 kisaanon kii samasyaon ko lekar swaminathan ayog kii report par bhi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Annoyed by this attitude of the government, Anna Hazare had written about all the issues in the letter and now also asked to agitate in Delhi if no response was received
 6 saal ho gaye andolan keinna hajaare ne bhrashtachar mukt bharat ko banane ke liye 2011 main ramlila maidan main andolan kiya tha
 After this, on August 27, 2011, the resolution was passed in the Indian Parliament from 'sense of the House'
 isamen centre main lokapal, har rajyon main lokayukta or citijan charter aise mahatvapurn muddon par jald se jald kanoon banane kaa nirnay kiya gaya tha
 After this, Anna Hazare postponed his agitation
 ise lekar 6 saal guzar chuke hai
 Anna said that the previous Central Government had passed the Lokpal Bill in 2013 itself and the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders had supported it then, but even after three years this law was not implemented, which would show Modi's indifference
 It is 'BJP did not fulfill its promise', Anna Hazare said in a letter written to Modi that the Lokpal and Lokayukta should play the role of opposition in both houses of Parliament while enacting the law
 BJP had also given full support to this law
 iske baad hue 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main aapaki party sarkaar bani
 After the Lokpal movement, the people of the country had chosen a new government under your leadership with great hope
 vahiin nai sarkaar ko muddon par amal karne ke liye paryaapt samay dena jaruri tha
 Anna Hazare also mentioned writing letters several times in the last three years, but received no reply from the PMO
 itnaa hi nahin naa kabhi man kii baat main lokapal or lokayukta kaa zikr kiya gaya
 He has written that before coming to power you had assured that we would create a corruption-free India
 haalanki aap 3 saal se lokapal or lokayukta kii niyukti nahin kar sake
 The Supreme Court has also reprimanded your government repeatedly
 isse ye saaf he ki aap lokapal, lokayukta kanoon par amal karne ke liye ichhashakti nahin dikhaa rahe hai
 Anna Hazare has also mentioned about the suicides of farmers in the country
 anna ke anusaar, maujuuda vakt main kheti paidaawari main kisaanon ko laagat par aadhaarit daam mili isliye maine kai baar patr likhaa tha
 However, no response came from your side nor did the Swaminathan Committee report take action
 isi vajah se pichley kai dinon se maharashtra, madhyapradesh, tamilnadu, andhrapradesh, telangna, haryana, rajasthan main kisaan andolan kar rahe hai
 Also, in the letter, Anna also demanded to bring political parties under the purview of information
 ab andolganna hajaare ne patr ke jariye kaha ki pichley 3 saal main aapaki sarkaar ne kisi patr kaa jawaab nahin diya
 For this, i have now decided to agitate in Delhi
 jab tak letters main likhen muddon par janhit main sahi nirnay or amal nahin hota tab tak main andolan dilli main jari rakhunga
 Anna Hazare had said in the next letter to announce the date of the movement
 yahi vajah he ki gandhi jayanti ke maukey par unka satyagrah usee maddenjar dekha ja rahaa he

 Actually, the conversation between Maharashtra Congress President Manik Rao Thackeray and former Minister Satish Chaturvedi has revealed that the Chief Minister and the Ministers had to pay big money for the Sonia Gandhi rally in Maharashtra
 sonia gandhi kii raily se thik ek din pehle nagpur main press conference ke dauraan maanik raav thakare or purv mantri ko raily main honevaale kharche kii ugaahi ko lekar baatcheet karte suna gaya

 Maharashtra Congress has prepared a lot for this rally of Sonia to be held today
 lekin raily ke liye jis tarah mukhyamantri or mantriyon se moti rakam ugaahne kii baat saamne aa rahi he usase raily kaa rang feekaa pad saktaa he

 austrailia ne somvaar ko sardaar vallabh bhai patel stadium main khele gaye tisare test match main bharat ko penalty shootout ke aadhaar par 3-2 se haraate hue teen maichon kii siries 2-0 se apane naam kar lee
 By the end of the stipulated time, India had won the match 3–2, but the name of the series was to be decided by a penalty shootout
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki donon tiimon ne is siries main chah-chah gol kiye the or donon ne ek-ek match jeeta tha
 In such a situation, the shootout became inevitable to decide the winner of the series
 nirdhaarit samay main bharat ne pehle penalty corner ko gol main badalte hue badhat hasil kii thi
 The goal for India was scored by VR Raghunath in the 17th minute
 iske baad 36wein minute main trent miton ne ek behtareen field gol karte hue apni team ko barabari par laa diya
 The third of the match and India's second goal was scored by Rupinder Pal Singh at penalty corner
 iske saath bharat ne badhat banaai
 The goal took place in the 41st minute, but Trent Mitton scored a field goal in the 54th minute to put his team on par
 match barabari par samaapt hone kii sthiti main austrailia yah siries 1-0 se jeet letaa, kyonki usne raipur main khele gaye duusare match main jeet hasil kii thi
 India probably did not approve of this
 usne apane hamale tej kar die
 It was in this battle that Akashdeep Singh scored a brilliant goal in the final minute to give his team a 3–2 victory, but the name of the series was to be decided by a penalty shootout and Australia won it
 bharat kii ore se shootout ke dauraan jo do gol hue unamem se ek penalty stroke par hua, lekin dharmaveer singh dwaara hasil duusare penalty stroke par raghunatha gol nahin kar sake
 If Raghunath had scored this goal, then both the teams would have got one chance each and in such a situation anything could have happened
 donon tiimon ke bich rajanandgaanv main 19 navambar ko khelaa gaya pehla muqabla 2-2 kii barabari par chuta tha
 After this, the second match played in Raipur was won by Australia 2–1
 khaas baat yah he ki rajanandgaanv or raipur main hue pehle match main bhartiya team ek samay badhat liye hue thi, lekin antim samay main uske lachar pradarshan ke kaaran austrailia ne pehla match drow kiya or doosraa match jeet liya
 This series was very important for both the teams
 yahaan 27 november se hone vaale hockey world lig (echdbluel) se pehle donon ko taiyaari kaa jayja lene kaa mauka mila or saath hi raipur ke maahaul main dhalane main safalataa mili
 The comments khaastaur par yah siries austrailia ke liye kaaphi ahm rahi, kyonki vah ab raipur ke mausam main puri tarah dhal chuki he or khitaab bachaane ke liye taiyaar he, lekin bharat se mili takkar ne use apni taiyaariyon par ek baar phir paini najar daalane par majaboor kiya he
 India has never bothered a strong team like Australia
 echdbluel main bharat or austrailia sahit kul 8 timen hissaa lengi
 The first edition of the league was won by Australia
 pehle sanskaran kaa aayojan nai dilli main hua tha
 In the stipulated time, India had the advantage of converting the first penalty corner into a goal
 bharat ke liye yah gol viaar raghunatha ne 17wein minute main kiya tha
 After this, in the 36th minute, Trent Mitton scored an excellent field goal, bringing his team on par
 match kaa teesraa or bharat kaa doosraa gol rupinder paal singh ne penalty corner par kiya
 With this, India took the lead
 yah gol 41wein minute main hua, lekin trent miton ne 54wein minute main field gol kiya or apni team ko barabari par laa diya
 Australia would have won the series 1–0 if the match ended in a tie, as they had won the second match played in Raipur
 bharat ko shaayad yah manjuur nahin tha
 He intensified his attacks
 isi kamr main akashadip singh ne antim minute main ek behtareen gol kar apni team ko 3-2 se jeet dilaa di, lekin siries kiske naam hogi, iskaa faisla penalty shootout se hona tha or isamen austrailia ne baaji maar lee
 One of the two goals scored by India during the shootout was on a penalty stroke, but Raghunath could not score a goal on the second penalty stroke by Dharamvir Singh
 agar raghunatha yah gol kar lete to phir donon tiimon ko ek-ek mauka or miltaa or aisi sthiti main kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 The first match played between the two teams at Rajnandgaon on 19 November was a 2-2 draw
 iske baad raipur main khelaa gaya doosraa muqabla austrailia ne 2-1 se jeeta tha
 The special thing is that in the first match at Rajnandgaon and Raipur, the Indian team had a lead at one time, but due to its poor performance at the last time, Australia drew the first match and won the second match
 yah siries donon tiimon ke liye kaaphi ahm thi
 Before the Hockey World League (HWL) to be held here from November 27, both got a chance to take stock of the preparations and also got success in the atmosphere of Raipur
 tippaniyan This series was especially important for Australia, as she is now fully in the Raipur season and is ready to save the title, but the collision with India forced her to once again keep a close eye on her preparations

 adhyadesh main vahi praavdhaan hai, jo loksabhaa main rakhe gaye bill main hai, isliye sarkaar kah sakati he ki iske praavdhaanon par vistaar se vichaar ho chukaa he
 Apart from this, the government will also get a chance to accuse the opposition that it is anti-poor, hence trying to block the way of the bill
 ek baar adhyadesh lagu ho jayega, to sarkaar ko isse judaa bill praathamikta ke aadhaar par sansad main rakhana hoga
 The ordinance contains the same provisions as in the bill laid in the Lok Sabha, so the government can say that its provisions have been considered in detail
 iske alaava sarkaar ko vipaksh par ye aarope lagane kaa mauka bhi mil jayega ki vah garib virdohi he, isliye bill kaa rasta rokane kii koshish kar rahaa he

 soshal mediake alaava kai media sansthaanon ne bhi is photo ke bare main aisi khabaren chalaai hai jisase ye lagata he ki adhikari par kailash ne juuta uthaaya tha
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) went to the bottom of this photo and found out the story of this 25-year-old photo
 asal kahani kuch or he
 Neither the officer was attacked, nor was he threatened by Kailash Vijayvargiya

 Presently, he is posted in NSG as IG New Delhi

 Was this photo tampered with? No, there is no tampering with this photo
 yah 1994 main khinchi gai thi
 It was drawn by a photographer from Prabhat Kiran, a evening newspaper in Indore
 jis aadmi ke haath main juuta he, vah kailash vijay vargeey hi hai
 He was then an MLA from Indore
 photo main uniform main jo police vaala dikh rahaa he, vah arun jain hai, jo us samay tukoganj police thane ke prabharee the

 i promised him that i would talk to the corporation commissioner and the problem would be resolved
 ve raji ho gaye or chakkaa jam hat gaya
 However, Falnikar says that the water problem did not end after a few days
 phir hamen pataa chalaa ki vijayawargeey or unke samarthakon ne varisht nigam adhikari kaa gheraav karne kaa nirnay liya he
 We increased the security of their house and reached the spot
 main vijayawargeey ko march na karne ke liye samajhane laga
 "I remember very well that the policeman seen in the photo is Arun Jain, in-charge of the police station
" '“yahi samay tha jab vijayawargeey ne apana juuta nikaala or mujhe dikhaate hue kaha- aapke kehane par hamane us din dharna khatm kar diya tha

 tabase yah photo kai baar circulet ho chuki he or bevajaah kaa vivaad paidaa kar chuki he
 "falnikar insists that at no point did Vijayvargiya threaten him, because his anger was with the corporation officers and not me
 duusare, aap photo main dekh sakate hai ki police vaala kaise aaraam se khadaa he
 "if a legislator had been indecent with an officer of a policeman, the policeman would have been reacting to something, he would not have stood so comfortably
 ”is ghatana kii or adhik pushti karne ke liye hamane 'prabhaat kiran' ke us photographer se sampark karne kii koshish kii, jinhone yah photo khinchi thi
 However, we could not contact them
 agar unase sampark hota he or unki pratikriya milti he to yah story main apadet kar diya jayega
 However, while everyone knows the story of Akash Vijayvargiya, at the same time social media and some media institutions have also come across a photo that is prima facie telling a different story, but the story behind it is something else

 In addition, a suicide attack was carried out on the mausoleum of Imam Ayatollah Khomeini
 aatanki sanghathan ISIS ne hamale kii jimmedaari lee he
 But the big question is: Why is Iran's parliament targeted on the path of development? In fact, after the Arab revolution started in 2011, there is a situation of crisis in Central Asia
 syria ab tak satta parivartan ke sangharsh kii aag main jhulas rahaa he
 On June 29, 2014, after the Arab Revolution, Abu Bakr al-baghdadi raised the flag of his caliphate

 ISIS gave Syrian internal conflict a facelift

 ISIS is on the verge of being decimated from Iraq

 darasal, bagdadi kii khilaafat kii avadharana hi puri duniya ko lead karne kii he
 The second reason behind the ISIS conspiracy behind the attack on Iran could also be its Shia country
 iran duniya kaa iklauta shiya mulk he, jo taqatvar mulkon ko sidhe takkar detaa he
 Since ISIS is considered to be a purely Sunni Muslim organization, the shia-sunni clash can also be considered as the reason for this attack

 duniyabar main smart divices kii lokapriyata badhati hi ja rahi he
 Whether it is a smartphone or a smart speaker or a smart watch
 lekin privesi ko lekar khatra bhi in divices ke saath hi badhata ja rahaa he

 The last day of November
 dopaher dedh baje kaa samay bhopal ke mashhoor new market ke quality restaurant main ek waiter adatan mezposh kii salawatein dur kar rahaa he
 The cook inside looks forward to preparing food on any order
 logon kaa manoranjan karne ke liye tivi chal rahe hai
 But the eyes seeing them are not there
 notebandi kaa aisa asar padaa he ki aam dinon main vyast rahane vaale is restaraan main is vakt koi bhi graahak nahin he
 It is not that money cannot be repaid here by digital means, yet there is some thing that people's steps have stopped
 kya bhopal or kya dilli, parchun kii dukaan se lekar gadipoon ke showrooms tak mandi kii jhini chadar bichhati ja rahi he? 9 november ko 500 or 1,000 ru
 The markets in most of the cities of the country have been unhealthy since the banknotes were out of circulation
 desh main vyapaariyon kii sabase badi sanstha kanfederation of ol india treders associations (sieity) ke mahasachiv praveen khandelwal halaat ko kuch is tarah bayaan karte hai, ''yah samaj lijie ki bazaaron ke kaarobaar main ausatan 70 se 75 fisadi kii giravat aa chuki he
 Demonetisation will bring good results in the long run, but for two to three months, the markets will have to go through this phase
 " ek duniyaadaar vyapaaree hone ke naate khandelwal bahut satark bayaan de rahe hai or ummid jataa rahe hai ki chote vyapaaree bhi kisi na kisi tarah ye teen maheene kaat lenge
 They are not willing to discuss much about the situation that if this round is stretched for six months, what will happen to the traders? But the signs are coming out from different markets of the country that the business leaders or business experts are demonetising for unknown reasons Extra precautions are being taken in revealing side effects
 vaise, notebandi ne bazaaron par bada naatakeey asar daalaa he
 Like, one lakh iphones were sold in the country within three days of demonetisation
 zyaadaatar dukandaaron ne inaki billing 8 november yaa isse pehle kii dikhaai
 The way people broke down on iphones to consume old notes, its sales increased manifold
 isi tarah 8 november kii raat sona puraane noton main 50,000 ru
 Up to 10 grams sold
 lekin uske baad?uske baad jo hua, vah dukandaaron ke liye bure sapane kii shuruyaat jaisaa tha
 Like leave the iphone, the entire mobile phone market of the country has sat down
 mobile udyog sutron kaa akalan he ki notebandi se pehle jahaan rojaanaa 350 se 400 karod ru
 While handsets were sold in the country, it has also become difficult to sell half of it
 kai badi mobile companiyaan apane karmchaariyon kii chantni karne kii sthiti main aa gai hai
 Since the launch of the Make in India campaign, in the last 18 months, 40 small and big companies were preparing to produce mobile handsets in the country, but now they have stopped their steps for the time being
 isse naukariyon par bade paimaane asar padane vaala he
 Meanwhile, on the night of demonetisation, the gold hoisting of the bats became a blast
 agle din desh bhar main pade exise ke chaape or uske baad chhaapon ke dar ke chalate dilli ke pramukh sarrapha bazaar band rahe
 When the famous markets like Karol Bagh opened, they were shocked to see customers
 sarrapha bazaar kaa haal yah he ki vahaan na ke baraabar graahak aa rahe hai
 Sarraf is in the mood that even if he sells gold, how should his e-transaction happen? Two lakhs
 se upar ke lenden par pancard anivaary ho gaya he
 Those who have legitimate money, they are also thinking that they may not get caught in the income tax due to big transactions
 agar kahin notice aa gaya to jawaab to dena hi padegaa
 The result of this mistrust between the government, traders and buyers is that despite the wedding season, the demand for gold has decreased by 80 percent
 aisa nahin he ki notebandi kaa yah asar sone or iphone jaisi mahangi chizon par hi padaa he
 The direct impact of this has gone to the groceries and vegetables in our neighborhood
 notebandi ke baad se dilli-ensiaar main aate kii keemat 6 ru
 Has increased to a kilo
 gajiabad ke vasundhara sector-4 main parchun kii dukaan chalaane vaale sunil kumaar ke chehre par is asar ko saaf padhaa ja saktaa he
 Sunil has been selling goods lending to his regular customers in Bada Sankhya for the last 20 days
 unki duvidha yah he ki agar graahakon ko maal udhaar nahin dete hai, to bandhe graahak chhot jaaenge
 Shopkeeping will sit separately
 notebandi ke baad unhone nai swip mashin mangai he, lekin vah unhen ab tak mil nahin pai he
 Many shoppers like him are struggling with this problem of swipe machine availability
 is samasya kii jad talashte hue khandelwal kehete hai, ''desh main is samay 14 lakh swip mashine hai, jabaki digital tranjaction ke liye kareeb do karod mashiinon kii jarurat he
 "in this way, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has raised the slogan of cashless transactions in the country with only 7 percent of the total swipe machines
 us par bhi gajab yah he ki swip mashine desh main nahin banatin or inke liye ham buree tarah se aayaat par nirbhar hai
 That is, shopkeepers like Sunil have to step in the next five-six months
 parchun kii dukaanon par kitna asar padaa he, ise aap alag-alag dukaanon par mahasoos kar sakate hai
 But its big picture is gauged by the latest activities of consumer goods major Hindustan Lever
 sutron kii maane to company ne tivi par dikhaae jane vaale apane vigyapanon ke bajet main 300 karod ru

 After this movement in the market and industry, rating agency Fitch estimated India's economic growth rate in the current financial year 7
 4 fisadi se ghataakar 6
 9 percent tax
 agle vitt varsh ke liye bhi aarthik vikaas dar ke anumaan ko ghataya gaya he
 That is, the demonetisation which the common man is seeing as the air dream of recovery of black money and the problems in the queues of the bank, its scope goes so far, as far as the need to think is to the economists chosen instead of the common man it occurs
 notebandi ke sankramak prabhaav kii vajah yah he ki desh main bazaaron kaa zyaadaatar kaamkaaj nakad main hi chalata he
 At present, only 14 per cent of the cash is available to the people
 is cash ke saath bhi samasya yah he ki jo log kai-kai din line main lagane ke baad nae noton kii jo pehali khep (kai maamalon main 2,000 ru
 Same note of), they do not want to spend it
 unki sidhi-si maansikta yah he ki jab note hasil karnaa itnaa kathin he to is note ko gadhe vakt ke liye sambhaal kar rakho
 This thinking of the common man is sensible, but fatal for the economy
 iskaa parinaam yah ho rahaa he ki jo 2 lakh karod ru
 RBI has also issued new notes, only a small part of them is being used in market transactions
 yani november kaa maheenaa khatm hote-hote jo rupaya logon ke haath main pahunchaa, asal main vah bazaar main nahin pahunch rahaa
 That is why the pulse of the markets is slowing down and enterprises like Quality Restaurant in Bhopal are craving customers for these reasons
 bazaar kii ye giravat tab or badhegi jab disambar ke pehle hafte main logon kii pagaar bank khate main to aa jaaegi, lekin unke haath main nahin pahonchegi
 In these circumstances, the cycle of cash reaching the workers and the market through the hands of the middle class will be broken
 is chakra ko sanbhaalane main sarkaar ko kai maheene lagenge, lekin is dauraan bazaar ke jo utpaadak din nasht ho gaye, ve waapas nahin aaenge

 How you approach the game is different in all three formats and you have to adjust

 Dhoni, who won the team title under his captaincy in the first Twenty20 World Cup in 2007, said that if India has to capture this trophy once again, then the part-time bowlers like Yuvraj Singh, who are returning to the team, will have to play a big role

 However, no official information about video calling has been given by the company
 bataa den ki whatsap ke video colling fitures ko iskaa 'much awated feechar' mana ja rahaa he
 However, until the video calling feature is not available on whatsapp, you can do video calling through this app in this way
 iske liye aapako ek third party ap yuj karnaa hoga
 Though there are many apps in the Play Store that claim video calling in whatsapp but most of them are fake

 Booyah is an app that you can make video calls by adding to whatsapp
 lekin dhyaan rahe is ap ke video conferencing feechar ko yuj karne ke liye resiver ke smartphone main bhi yah install hona jaruri he
 How to do this video call: First of all download the Booyah app from Google Play Store which is absolutely free
 iske baad jisase aapako video kol karnaa he use invitesan bhejein
 Invitation will go through whatsapp, in which a link will appear
 is link ko clic karte hi video colling shuru ho jaaegi
 If the next user's smartphone does not have a Booyah app, then this link will be taken directly to the Google Play Store from where the app can be downloaded
 isaki khaasiyat yah he ki isse sirfvatsap contacts ko hi video collingki invitesan bheji ja sakati he
 Also, group calling can be done through this
 bataa den ki isamen yugers ko link bheji jaati he jisase wo video kol main aid hote hai

 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad reached Patna for the first time on Sunday after Article 370 was removed from Jammu and Kashmir
 ek kaarykram main pahunche prasad ne dhara 370 par patrakaron se khulkar baat kii
 Prasad said that Article 370 had become a symbol of injustice in Jammu and Kashmir for the last 70 years
 jammu kashmir ke kuch netaa iskaa durupyog kar rahe the
 He said that due to Article 370, many laws were not implemented in Jammu and Kashmir and the people there could not benefit from them
 prasad ne sawaal kiya ki jammu kashmir kii koi muslim ladki agar rajya ke baahar ke kisi muslim yuvak se bhi shaadi karti he, to is anuchhed ke kaaran sampatti se uskaa adhikaar khatm ho jaataa he
 What kind of law is this? The Union Law Minister said that due to this article, tribals could not get reservation in Jammu and Kashmir
 ab modi sarkaar ne is anuchhed ko hi samaapt kar diya he jiske baad jammu or kashmir ke adivaasiyon ko bhi aarakshan kaa puraa laabh milegaa
 He said that abolishing Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir is not a victory for the Narendra Modi government, but respect for the people of Jammu and Kashmir

 Significantly, the Congress executive elected Sonia Gandhi as interim president late on Saturday night
 is mudde par bijepi pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain ne kaha tha ki ek baar phir yah sabit ho gaya he ki congress ek parivaar kii party he
 Recently, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has come into action even before the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh is officially taken over
 america se apni beti kaa ilaaj karakar somvaar raat desh lautin priyanka ne purvi uttar pradesh main kaaryakartaaon ko apane saath jodne ke liye 'personal tach' kii yojana taiyaar kii he
 On returning to Delhi, Priyanka went to meet her brother and party president Rahul Gandhi at her house
 iske baad unhone west upi ke prabharee jyotiraditya sindhiya se bhi mulaakaat kii thi
 As part of his 'personal touch' scheme, Priyanka's staff has sought details of 15 key party leaders and workers from all the district heads of eastern UP
 har jiladhyaksh se unke ilaake ke 15 mahatvapurn netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke naam, number, pataa or mail idi maangi gai he

 In fact, Priyanka believes that to restore the Congress which has been marginalized in the state of UP for a long time, first of all the workers will have to be strengthened and they have to be assured of being close to the high command
 isi lihaaj se priyanka ne yah eksrasij shuru kii he
 Soon Priyanka will be in touch with all of them after taking full details

 Rahul Gandhi has appointed two in-charge general secretaries in West and Eastern Uttar Pradesh to strengthen the party's position in the state, with Priyanka Gandhi taking charge of East Uttar Pradesh and former Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in charge of West Uttar Pradesh
 aakhir priyanka ko apana turup kaa ikkaa maanakar rahul gandhi ne narendra modi or yogi adityanath ke saamne purvi upi ke chunavi ran main utaara he or priyanka bhi jaanati hai ki chunauti badi he

 Twitter has fallen prey to the arm-twisting tactics of the Congress-led UPA government
 yah khaasi prachlit microbloging site pichley paanch maheenon se 'aapattijanak' twit par lagaam kasne main sarkaar kii ek tarah se madad kar rahi he
 On January 28, Twitter revealed its censorship policies for a particular country, even before it had technically made Twitter so capable that all tweets criticizing the Congress party, its president Sonia Gandhi and general secretary Rahul Gandhi were eliminated
 Lets do it
 internet ke maharathi khilaadi google or fasebuk bhi adaalat ke aadesh ke anuroop apana ravaiya badalane ko majaboor hue hai
 On February 1, three days after Twitter announced its filter policy, Google also announced its filter policy for the country
 google ne 6 farvari ko dilli kii jila adaalat ko bataaya ki usne 24 disambar, 2011 ko die gaye uske nirdesh ke mutabik web pannon se kuch khaas aapattijanak samagriyaan hataa di hai
 Without revealing what that particular content is, Google spokeswoman Paroma Chaudhary said her review team reviewed youtube and Blogger's local domains and removed the objectionable items
 fasebuk ne adaalat ko bataaya ki vah is website ke sarwar ko niyantrit yaa sanchalit nahin kar saktaa kyonki yah sarwar america main he
 Not satisfied with this, the judge asked Facebook to give a full report within 15 days
 report main is baat kii puri jaankaree maangi ki aapattijanak saamagree ko hataane ke liye usne kya kadam uthaae? agali sunwaayee 1 march ko hogi
 Twitter took such a step without legal compulsion
 india today ne 1 farvari ko twitor par gaayab ho gaye ek coment ke sambandh main online jaankaree maangi thi, lekin uskaa koi jawaab nahin mila
 Information Technology Minister Kapil Sibal said that he had no information about the unofficial censorship of Twitter
 lekin sibbal ne 5 sitambar, 2011 ko google or fasebuk samet soshal netwarking site ke pratinidhiyon ke liye bulaai gai baithak main twitor ko nahin bulaayaa
 Many people surfing the internet say that their tweets criticizing the Congress and the government are either published late or are being removed within three hours
 unhen phir se twit karne yaa congress, sonia or rahul par koi aalochanatmak tippanee karne main mushkil pesh aa rahi he
 Prabir Purkayastha of the Delhi Science Forum says, "the Internet has become much more controlled now
" print media se bhi zyada, jisane apane liye kanoonee suraksha kaa bandobast kar rakhaa he
 "it only deals with business interests
" ve kehete hai, ''soshal netwarking site ke liye hindustan ek bada bazaar he or ve nahin chaahate ki phaayde ke is saude se ve haath dho baithen
 Internet surfers say that the first censorship was first reported to them in September 2011, a few days after Sibal's meetings with Google and Facebook executives
 report ke mutabik sibbal ne unhen sonia kii aalochana karne vaale kuch pej dikhaae or bina kisi shor-sharabe ke chupchaap aisi chizon ko pratibandhit karne ke liye kaha
 He warned that if they failed to do so, the government had so much power that they could be in trouble

 He says, "I don't understand what's happening
" baad main jaakar khulaasa hua ki sarkaar virdohi twit ko sensor kiya ja rahaa tha
 "the tweets of those who are the creators of ideology or who have a lot of followers are being monitored
" varisht patrkaar sagarika ghosh ne bhi shikaayat kii ki unke account se sarkaar kii aalochana karne vaale twit gaayab ho gaye
 On January 3, he tweeted, "what a strange thing! Apart from flattering advertisements of Congress, my tweet has disappeared from my timeline

 People are exchanging ideas
 isse sarkaar ko khatra mahasoos hota he
 "they hope that this fight between the government and the public will be further strengthened
" ve kehete hai, ''soshal media main maujuud zyaadaatar log yuva or ugr hai
 This group can hit the streets with the same strength as the person who presses the Inter button on the keyboard
 isse sarkaar baichaiyn he
 Statistics from the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology show that 3
 5 karod hindustani apane gharon main internet kaa istemaal karte hai
 This number is expected to reach 400 million in the next ten years
 agar internet yujar soshal media ke jariye khud ko ek bade samooh ke rup main sangathit kar lete hai to sarkaar ke liye sachmuch bada sankat khadaa ho jayega
