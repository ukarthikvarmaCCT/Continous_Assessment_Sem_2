 aapane kabhi apana purana smartphone bechaa to hoga hi
 Must have reset it before selling
 lekin kya aapane sochaa he ki kharidne vaala aapke smartphone se delit kii gai personal photose, videos or duusare jaruri data phir se ricover kar saktaa he
 After that, he will obviously have all your things
 aisa pehle se hota aa rahaa he or logon kii laaparvaahee kii vajah se abhi bhi ho rahaa he
 Take for example a study of Avast
 security form ne kuch puraane smartfontasting ke liye kharida
 He retrieved 40,000 of them, with 750 photos of half naked women and more than 250 nude selfies
 smartphone se 750 email or text, 250 naam or adress or porn collection ricover kiye gaye
 Apart from this, Honor Information of loan applications and old smartphones were also found
 ummid he aap is udhaaharan se ye samaj gaye honge ki purana smartphone bechnaa kaise khatre se khaali nahin he
 But this can be avoided
 aap agar apana smartphone bech rahe hai to aapako saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat he
 It is wrong to assume that just by doing a factory reset your data will not be recovered
 isliye aap bechney se pehle in tareekon se apane smartphone ke data kii safai karen taaki kharidaar aapke data kaa miss yuj na kar sake
 First of all, backup all the data in your computer before selling the smartphone
 behatar hoga kisi eksternal drive main date seve kar len
 Do not forget to remove the SIM card and memory card
 jimail or sabhi services ko pehle log out kar len
 Encrypt phone: There is an option to encrypt smartphone in Android smartphone settings
 encript karne ke baad aapkaa pehle jaisaa hi kaam karegaa
 But when its data is recovered it will be encrypted
 phone ancript karke ise factory riset karen or dhyaan rakhen Clean Wipe hona chahie
 After doing this it will be difficult for people to recover your data
 google play store par kai ap hai jo smartphone se personal datadilit karne kaa daawa karte hai
 But one of these is the Avast Anti Theft app which is present on the Play Store with good ratings and reviews
 ise free downlod kiya ja saktaa he
 By installing it, the entire data of the device can be erased
 isapar acount bana kar smartphone kho jane kii haalat main rimatoli data bhi delit kiya ja saktaa he
 The last way is to delete everything, yet you are not sure whether your data is finished or else do one thing
 riset karke apane smartphone ko farji files se bhar den jise junk data bhi kaha jaataa he
 Next, encrypt and reset the factory again
 ab agar data ricover hua bhi to junk file hi duusare ke haath lagegi or aapkaa jaruri data kabhi ricover nahin ho paaegaa

 At the same time, his party's voice on this issue is weakening in Parliament
 party ke mukhar saansad bhagwant maan ko loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne do or hafton ke liye sadan kii kaarywahi main hissaa na lene kii salaah di he
 Along with this, he has also extended the tenure of the tenure of the committee headed by BJP MP Kirit Somaiya, which is examining the video of Bhagwant Mann regarding the security system of Parliament
 gauratlab he ki aam aadmi party ke loksabhaa main chaar saansad hai, inamen se do saansad doctor dharmaveer gandhi or harinder singh khalsa ko aam aadmi party ne hi party virdohi gatividhiyon ke kaaran nilambit kar rakhaa he
 While Bhagwant Mann could not participate in the proceedings of the House in the last full session
 ab aam aadmi party kii aawaaj buland karne kii jimmedaari party ke akele bache saansad professor sadhu singh par he
 There is currently no MP for the Aam Aadmi Party in the Rajya Sabha
 aam aadmi party kii dikkat yah bhi he ki vah punjab vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle ho rahe sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main punjab se jude kai pramukh muddon ko uthaanaa chaah rahi thi
 These include important issues like the Supreme Court's decision on the Yamuna Sutlej Link Canal, the state government's role in prohibition

 However, then the budget session of Parliament will be going on because this time the budget session will start a month in advance, but then the issues related to the budget are likely to dominate

 Significantly, the Aam Aadmi Party has four mps in the Lok Sabha, out of which two mps, Dharmveer Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa, have been suspended by the Aam Aadmi Party for anti-party activities
 jabaki bhagwant maan pichley puure satr main sadan kii kaarywahi main hissaa nahin le sake the
 Now the responsibility of raising the voice of the Aam Aadmi Party is on the lone lone MP of the party, Professor Sadhu Singh
 rajyasabha main abhi aam aadmi party kaa koi saansad nahin he
 The problem of the Aam Aadmi Party is also that it wanted to raise many major issues related to Punjab in the Winter Session of Parliament happening just before the Punjab Assembly elections
 inamen yamuna sutluj link nahar ko lekar supreme court kaa faisla, nashaabandi ko lekar rajya sarkaar kii bhoomika jaise mahatvapurn mudde shaamil hai

 The comments loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne bhagwant maan ke vishay par 25 july ko kirit somaiyya kii adhyakshata main nau saansadon kii ek samiti banaai thi
 Many mps had then complained that Bhagwant Mann messed with the security of Parliament as he made public the sensitive scenes inside on social media
 is samiti ko aaj apni report deni thi
 The speaker said today that he has received an application from the chairman of the committee that the committee needs two more weeks to prepare its report
 in kaarnon par gaur karne ke baad unhone samiti ko 19 november se do saptaah kaa samay or dene kaa nirnay liya he
 At the same time, he has advised Bhagwant Mann that he should not participate in the proceedings of the House until the committee's report comes

 The shameful attitude of the film censor board regarding the 'babumoshai gunbaz' film certification has come to light
 film ke trailor main dikhaae gaye intimet seens ke chalate pehle se hi film charchaa main thi
 There was also the fact that the censor board's scissors would run on the love making scenes of the film
 lekin sensor board ne film ko lekar kuch aisa kaha jis par yakeen karnaa mushkil he
 a few days ago, the makers of Nawazuddin Siddiqui starrer 'babumoshay gunman' sent the film to the censor board for certification
 film kii screening ke baad sensor board ne film ko a reating dene or 48 kats ke saath film ko paas karne kaa faisla kiya
 But the extent was reached when a member of the censor board committee started insulting Kiran Shroff, the producer of the film 'babumoshay Gunbaaz'
 film produsar kiran shroff ne bombai times ko die gaye intervyuu main kaha kijab sensor bordfilmamen lagaae gaye kats kii vajahen gina rahe the tab board meeting main baithi ek mahila sadsy meri taraf mudin or boleen, aap aurat hokar aisi filmein kaise bana sakati hai
 Kiran Shroff used to say something before that a man sitting in the committee said, but this woman is not there, see how they have dressed
 ' bataa den ki kiran shroff ne is dauraan simple paint shart dress pahani hui thi
 Hearing this, Kiran Shroff's feet went out like ground
 vah ye dekhakar hairaan thi ki vahaan baithi mahila ne bhi vahi kapade pahane hue the jo unhone pahane hai to vah aurat kaise nahin ho sakati
 Kiran Shroff said in the interview that those who can make their own perception by looking at their clothes, i can think what criteria they must keep in mind to pass the film
 'film ke diarector kushan nandi ne yah bhi bataaya ki film main lagaae gaye kats ko lekar pehlaaj nihlani ne unhe kaha ki tum lucky ho jo tumhaari film ko bain nahin hui

 The tenure of the current vice-chancellor and former IPS officer Vibhuti Narayan Rai is coming to an end this month, but he has stepped up lobbying to hold the post again
 unki lobing kaa hi nateeja he ki search cameti ke chairman ashok vaajapeyi ke kade virodh or apane vivaadaaspad kaarykaal ke baavjood raashtrapati ko bheje jane vaale panel main raay kaa naam shaamil ho chukaa he
 The search committee has approved a panel of five names for the new vice-chancellor, the first of which is Purshottam Agarwal, a former member of the Union Public Service Commission, and the second name is Uday Narayan Singh, the famous linguist and pro vice chancellor of visva-bharati
 
 panel main teesraa naam sanskrit ke sabase varishthatam professor maane jane vaale or philhal rashtriya sanskrit santhaan (dimd uniwarsity) ke kulapati radhavallabh treepathi kaa he
 While Vibhuti Narayan Rai, who is involved in every season for the second term, is in fourth place
 paanchave naam ke taur par dilli uniwarsity main manovigyaan ke professor girishwar mishra shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Ashok Vajpayee, chairman of the search committee, declined to disclose any names for confidentiality in a conversation with India Today, but when asked, he gave a panel of five names and a 'descent note' (dissent note) on one of them
 to be confirmed
 sutron ke mutabik vaajapeyi ne awwal to vibhuti narayan raay kaa naam panel main shaamil kiye jane kaa virodh kiya, lekin search cameti kii sadsy kapila vatsayayan ke ad jane par vaajapeyi ne decent note ke saath panel main naam jane diya
 According to sources, Rai visited Kolkata twice last month to get his name included in the panel and met Vatsyayan's brother Keshav Malik and was also greeted by calling Keshav Malik at Wardha
 raay kii dobaaraa niyukti ke prati aashwast vishvavidhyalay main unke hi ek samarthak bataate hai ki vibhuti narayan ne raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke saansad putr abhijit mukherjee se bhi pairvi ke liye guhaar lagaai he
 Where he was asked to first include his name in the panel
 sutara bataate hai ki is bharose ke baad raay ne panel main apana naam shaamil karaane ke liye puri takat jhonk di
 The chairman of the search committee was Vajpayee the nominee of the president, while Kapila Vatsyayan and management guru Pritam Singh as members
 kya raashtrapati apane nomini kii asahmati khaarij karenge?ab sawaal uthta he ki kya raashtrapati pranab mukherjee search cameti ke chairman ashok vaajapeyi ke decent note ko khaarij karenge
 Vajpayee was chairing the search committee as the President's nominee
 vaajapeyi ne raay ke naam par apni asahmati jaahir kar vistrut note lagaaya he
 Currently, a confidential envelope with a panel of five names for the new vice-chancellor is with the HRD ministry and what the ministry gives its opinion on Vajpayee's descent note will also be important in the president's decision
 haalanki hindi vishvavidhyalay kii aniyamittaaon ke khilaaf ladaai lard rahe chaatr sangharsh samiti ko ashanka he ki ho saktaa he ki mantralay is decent note ko raashtrapati ke paas hi nahin bheje, kyonki purv main ek baar professor kii niyukti ke maamle main decent note phada ja chukaa he
 The country's only international Hindi university has not been able to achieve its objective yet
 kuch samay pehle raay ne india today se baatcheet main apane purv ke kulapatiyon ashok vaajapeyi or gopinathan ko vishvavidhyalay ke pichhadgaye kaa jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 He even said that there should be a debate in the literary world why this university should not be closed
 yahaan niyuktiyon se lekar har maamle main vivaad uthta rahaa he
 Rai, who has created a ruckus by using the word 'chinal' for women writers, however, in a conversation with India Today, described it as the biggest mistake of his life
 lekin vivaadon ke baavjood raay kulapati kii kursi aasaani se chhodte nahin dikh rahe
 According to sources, Vice Chancellor of this University has used his reach from the top leaders of the ruling party of Uttar Pradesh to the search committee and the Ministry of Human Resource Development to regain the chair
 search cameti ne 7 oktober ko panel tay karte hue lipaphe ko silband kar diya, lekin agle din hi 8 oktober ko bambe hoicourt kii nagpur bainch ne farji migration certificate ke maamle main raay or vishvavidhyalay ke anya adhikariyon ke saath-saath maharashtra sarkaar ko notice jari kar poocha he ki kyon nahin is maamle main sibiai jaanch karai jaae

 Not because the government will complete two years on that day, but because by that day it will be decided that what Modi has entrusted concretely to the middle class and youth of India, which has even brought the BJP sedan on its shoulder? The biggest mistake of the Modi government is not that it was cut off from farmers and villages in the first year itself
 gaanv na to bijepi ke rajnatik ganit kaa hissaa the or na hi modi kaa chunaav abhiyaan gaanvon par kendrit tha
 The biggest concern for Modi is the expectations of the young and middle class who have given a new dimension to their politics and in the first year Modi could not do anything for them
 rojgaar or mahangaai, bhartiya gavarnence kii sabase ghisi hui bahase hai lekin inhen donon maamalon main modi se li todane kii sabase zyada ummiden bhi hai kyonki congress ke khilaaf abhootpurv janadesh main paanch saal kii mahangaai or 2008 ke baad ubhari nai bekaari bhidi hui thi
 While listening to speeches and reading advertisements on the first anniversary of the Modi government, you will not be shocked if you find the least arguments on these two issues
 yaad kiijie pichley saal kii garmiyon main modi kii chunavi reliyon main umadti yuvaaon kii bheed
 How can you forget the provocative debates of Modi's support among the neighboring families? It was not a traditional BJP voter
 yah samaajawaadee va udaaravaadi prayogon ke tajurbon se las madhya varg tha jo modi ke sandesh ko gaanvon va nichle tabakon tak le gaya
 Of course, no one expected magic from Modi in a year, but he was heard speaking almost every other day and the silence on the jobs of the Prime Minister who spoke from children to drug addicts was unexpected
 modi kaa maun unki naukariyon par sarkaar kii niskriyata kii dein tha
 In fact, in 2015 on all dimensions, permanent, temporary, private, government and self-employment, the employment got worse from 2014
 lebar beuro ne isi april main bataaya ki pramukh aath udyogon main rojgaar srijan kii dar timahi ke nunatam str par he
 Villages are in worse condition due to crop wastage and employment program being stalled
 safaltaaon ke gungan main sarkaar skill deveopment kaa sur ooncha karegi lekin skill vaale mahakme ke mutabik, sabase zyada rojgaar (6 karod salanaa) bhawan nirmaan, retail or transport se nikalate hai
 You do not have to be an economic expert to measure recession in these areas
 real estate gart main he, retail bazaar ko sarkaar kholana nahin chaahati or transport kii maang in donon par nirbhar he
 In fact, other missions could wait, however, for the jobs, only the newly equipped mission was expected
 ab jabaki monsoon daraa rahaa he or global agenciyaan bharat kii growth ke lakshya ghataane vaali hai to modi ke liye, agle ek saal ke dauraan karodon berozegaar yuvaaon ko apane prachaar se baandh paanaa bada mushkil hone vaala he
 Recently, when the prices of petrol and diesel returned to their thorny levels and after the weather hit, the prices of essential commodities started touching new heights, the middle and lower classes did not just feel that the destiny of luck was over but it was much deeper The feeling was that even this government had no idea to reduce the cost of living
 mahangaai se nibatane ke modi model kii charchaa yaad he? chunaav ke dauraan is par kaaphi samvaad hua tha
 a report of Modi as Chief Minister of Gujarat was cited
 maang kii bajaae aapurti ke raste mahangaai ko thaamne ke vichaar hawa main tair rahe the
 To stop the price rise, the price stabilization fund was called by the government as its 'powerful' idea
 alabatta july 2014 main ghoshit yah fund may, 2015 main ban paaya or vah bhi keval 500 karod ru
 With the fund of K, which is currently unable to think ahead of potato-onion inflation
 satta main aane ke baad nai sarkaar ne, mahangaai rokane ke liye rajyon ko mandi kanoon khatm karne kaa farmaan jari kiya tha jise bijepi shasit rajyon ne bhi lagu nahin kiya
 Who should buy the displeasure of traders? If inflation is hanging on the head and the demand is low, then petrol of taxes should not be sprinkled in the fire of prices
 lekin sarkaar kaa doosraa bajet exise or sarvice tex ke nae chabukon se las tha
 Crude oil has not crossed $ 100, but the petrochemical products in India have started burning again, then the budget is responsible for this, which imposed new taxes on petrochemical products
 sarkaar jab tak ek saal ke jashn se nikal kar agle varsh kii sochna shuru karegi tab tak sarvice tex kii dar main do fisadi kii badhat mahangaai ko nae tevar de chuki hogi
 The loss of the Rabi crop has started to erode the prices of food products
 agar monusan ne dhokhaa diya to modi agle saal, thik unheen sawaalon kaa saamana kar rahe honge jo vah prachaar ke dauraan congress se puch rahe the
 Although the slogans wear off, the promise of bringing good days was the biggest political statement in the latest history of India, which had an unprecedented psychological impact on the middle class
 modi isi madhya varg ke netaa hai, jisaki koi bhi charchaa rojgaar va mahangaai kii chintaa ke bina puri nahin hoti, kyonki desh ke mahaj das fisad log hi sthaayee vetanbhogi hai or aam log apni kamai kaa 45 se 60 fisad hissaa sirf khaane par kharch karte hai
 When the government is completing its first year, consumption is at a ten-year low, employment is zero and inflation is returning
 modi sarkaar kaa asli moolyankan ab shuru ho rahaa he, pehla saal to keval taiyaariyon ke liye tha
 After the tensions between India and the US over the Devyani Khobragade case, the rise of the Prime Ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Narendra Modi may now cause more tension between the two countries

 Time's senior correspondent Michael Crowley writes, "but the relationship is not expected to improve soon

 ' croule kehete hai ki aagaamee aam chunaav main agar bhaajapa jitati he to modi agle pradhanmantri banenge
 According to Time, 'he is still unacceptable to America because of the communal violence of February 2002
 modi ke aalochak kehete hai ki unhone hinsa kii yaa phir hinsa kii andekhi kii yaa phir use bhadakaayaa
 The charge against him has been strongly denied and he has not been found guilty in any court of India
 ' Crowley says the US State Department in 2005 denied a visa to Modi under US law
 unhone kaha he, 'jab modi kisi rashtriya str kii bhoomika main the, tab yah pratibandh apraasangik tha
 But can America blacklist the Head of Government of India? vah kehete hai ki america ke nitinirmaataa is mudde par bante hue hai
 He said, "in the proposal presented in the US Congress, the State Department was required to maintain the ban on Modi's entry
 ' Crowley writes, 'realists and American businessmen want to take advantage of Modi's open approach to foreign investment, and he says that his character should not be considered as important for America's broader relations with India
 ' He says, "if Modi wins, the Obama administration will put pressure on the people of India and outside the country to condemn his past and ban his America
" lekin raashtrapati baraak obama ko raashtra hit main alag siddhant apnaanaa hoga
 ' croule ne kaha, 'in varsho ke dauraan america ne bharat se kam mithravat deshon ke ghrunit netaaon ke saath sambandh banaaya he
 By not giving Modi a visa, the US government has clarified its stand on Modi and Gujarat violence
 ' With this, he says that it is necessary for both countries not to go back because of Modi's past

 ' america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ne shanivaar ko kaha ki desh main naslbhed ke khilaaf ladaai samaapt nahin hui he
 Obama said this at the event in Selma, Alabama, to mark 50 years of the march by African American citizens demanding the right to vote
 obama ne kaha, 'ham jaanate hai ki march samaapt nahin hua he
 'thousands of people had gathered at Selma's Edund Pets Bridge during this period, where the police used force on activists in 1965, which is recorded in history as' Bloody Sunday'
 obama ne kaha, 'hamen sirf apni ankhen, kaan or dil kholane kii jarurat he taaki ham yah dekh saken ki desh ke nasleey bhedbhaav ke itihaas kii chaaya abhi bhi ham par maujuud he

 rahul gandhi in dinonchuttee par hai
 This holiday of Rahul is in controversies due to his timing (budget session), while news is coming from inside that Rahul is angry with the party
 agar vaaki aisa he to unki naaraazgi rang laati dikh rahi he
 If sources are to be believed, preparations are on to make Rahul as Congress President in the Congress session in April
 sutron ke mutabik, sonia or priyanka rahul ko yah samajhane main lagbhag kaamyaab hote dikh rahe hai ki beshak wo apni team banaaen, apane hisaab se party chalaaen, lekin varisht netaaon ko vaazib sammaan dete rahen
 Meanwhile, Rahul's absence in Congress's much-publicized protest against the Land Acquisition Ordinance in Delhi has been a matter of discussion
 haalanki 'naaraaz' rahul chuttee par kahaan gaye hai, is par ek nayaa vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 Regarding this, the Congress says that Rahul is abroad, while Congress leader Jagdish Sharma released the picture and told that Rahul is in Uttarakhand
 unhone bataaya ki rahul tent main rah rahe hai or devbhumi par ganga kinare adhiveshan ko lekar aage kii ranneeti bana rahe hai
 Jagdish Sharma said, 'I knew from day one where Rahul is
 mujhe nahin lagata ki unka koi kareebi yah kah saktaa he ki wo videsh main hai
 a variety of things came up in the media report after which i decided that i will tell where Rahul Gandhi is
 maine mangalvaar raat ko tasviir jari kii
 However, these claims of Sharma have been rejected by the Congress
 rahul gandhi ke daftar kii taraf se bayaan aayaa he ki jagadish sharma ke daavon ko naa mana jaae

 Sambit Patra said that the Congress party does not trust the army
 bijepi pravaktaa ne is dauraan purv pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru or indira gandhi par bhi hamalaa bolaa
 Patra said that while Nehru allowed the partition of the country to become Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi implemented Emergency in the country
 sambit paatra ne kaha ki rajeev gandhi kaa 84 dangon ke lekar diya gaya bayaan sabhi ko yaad he
 He said that the Congress party killed 3000 Sikhs to gain power in the country
 sambit ne kaha ki congress party ko supreme court, piemo, sena, chunaav ayog, aadhaar card, arabiai, raashtrapati par bhi vishwaas nahin he
 He said that Congress says that they gave IIM, IIT and Constitution, why not Congress also make such claims on moon, stars, trees and sun
 paatra bole ki aajrahul gandhi kaha ki unhone desh ko samvidhan diya ye baba sahib ambedkar kaa apmaan he
 He said that the person who cannot write 15 lines himself is saying today that 15 minutes is not being allowed to speak
 jo vyakti bina mobile main dekhe ek minute nahin bol saktaa vah 15 minute kya bolenge
 The BJP spokesperson said that Rahul Gandhi is a failed leader, so he is raising such issues
 ye samvidhan bachaao nahin rahul bachaao abhiyaan he
 He said that this anger of Rahul Gandhi was because somewhere today, familyism is outperforming and ordinary people are reaching power
 gauratlab he ki somvaar ko hi congress party ne samvidhan bachaao abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii he
 During this time, Rahul Gandhi directly targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 The comments sie ne bayaan main kaha, 'australia 'e' ke liye yah ek vikaas daura he jo khilaadiyon ko ucch str par pradarshan karne kaa mauka muhaiyaa karaata he

 nitish kumaar ne piem modi se maang kii he ki vartmaan baadh or sukhaad kii sthiti kaa saamana karne hetu bihar ko paryaapt kendriya sahaayta di jaae
 Nitish Kumar said that this would allow an assessment of the infallibility of the Ganga's avidity, the accumulation of unpredictable silt and the prevalence of the Farakka barrage in the present situation

 10 lakh hectare me lagi fasal barbaad ho gai
 16760 houses were demolished and 95 people died
 farkka bairaj se pani chode jane par bihar main badhpiem modi ko likhe patr main nitish kumaar ne ganga ke bade hue jal str kii vajah farkka bairaj ko bataaya he
 He said that due to the construction of the Farakka Barrage, there has been a lot of silt deposition in the Ganges river
 gaad ke kaaran hi ganga ke jal pravaah kshamta main hraas hua he
 He said that the attention of the center has been drawn several times due to the accumulation of silt in the Ganges and a national silt management policy has also been requested to solve it
 lekin abhi tak is par koi nirnay kendra dwaara nahin liya gaya he jis kaaran bihar ko baadh kii samasya lagaataar jhelni pad rahi he or bihar kaa janajivan isse prabhavit ho rahaa he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has written that unless the National Silt Management Policy is formed and implemented, the rain in Bihar, Nepal and neighboring states will continue to face the threat of floods in the Ganges
 nitish kumaar ne aage likhaa he ki ganga kii nirmalata ke saath-saath uski aviralata par samekit drushtikon rakhane kii aavashyaktaa he

 balaatkaar ke doshiyon ko maut kii sajaa dene kii maang ko lekar aam aadmi party kii netaa swati maliwal rajghat par anshan kar rahi hai
 His campaign is fully supported by the party
 anshan sthal par maliwal ko samarthan dene dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal, upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya sahit tamaam jane maane log pahunche, lekin vahiin AAP ke netaa ashutosh ne alag rukh akhriyaar kiya he
 AAP leader Ashutosh has opposed the death sentence of the rapists
 unhone 'aaj tak' se kaha, kisi bhi sabhy samaaj main jaan lene kaa adhikaar nahin hona chahie
 There is no problem with the law in India, rather it is not implemented properly
 i don’t support capital punishment
 - ashutosh (@ ashutosh83b) April 21, 2018 Ashutosh said, there was a big movement about Nirbhaya, made law
 magar aaj bhi maasoom bacchiyon or mahilaon ke saath balaatkaar ho rahaa he
 So has enactment of law created fear in rapists? He said that if we want to stop rape, nothing will happen until we change the system of India, the judiciary and society
 ashutosh ne kaha,fast trek courthona ek acchhee shuruyaat he
 Because law is not followed in this country and prosecutions are pending for 20 years due to which criminals are saved
 unhone kaha ki desh main aise mukhyamantri hai jinhen mahilaon ke genes pahanane par aapatti hoti he yaa aise log jinhen skirt pahanane vaali ladakiyon se aapatti hoti he, jo mahilaon ko balaatkaar ke liye zimmedaar tehraati he
 This kind of ideology is growing rapidly in the country, if not opposed, rape or atrocities will not be reduced
 aam aadmi partike netaa ne kaha, kathua ke maamle main police vaala khud balaatkaar main shaamil he
 When AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal differed on the issue of capital punishment to rapists, Ashutosh said the party's ideology was no different
 kejariwal kii chintaa he ki maasoom bacchiyon se balaatkaar nahin hona chahie
 He said, how will fear arise? What fear will arise due to legislation? Fear will arise when the next man feels that he may go behind bars for wrongdoing, but law is not being followed in this country
 police kii niskriyata par ashutosh kehete hai ki bijepi vidhayak kuldeep singh senger unnav ke maamle main der raat vidhayak esaspi ke ghar jaakar kahata he giraftaar karo kyonki use pataa he ki police giraftaar nahin karegi
 When there is such a system in the country where the rapists are roaming freely, enact a death sentence or make a plan to shoot in public, there will be no implementation

 chandigarh main ek IAS afasar kii beti varnika kundu ke saath hue chhedchhad ke maamle main baari dabaav ke baad pulisia jaanch tej ho gai
 The police have arrested him after issuing summons to the main accused in the case, Vikas Barala and his friend
 lekin sabase bada sawaal ki kya aropiyon ko sajaa ho paaegi yaa phir pehle kii tarah ve jamaanat par reeha ho jaaenge
 The police may have arrested them, but will the charges be proved in court
 court main saboot or tathyon ke aadhaar par hi karrwahee chalati he or aaropee ko sajaa di jaati he
 Seeing the negligence of the police in the Varnika case from the beginning, it seems that the accused can easily escape
 police se sabase pehali galati medical jaanch main hui he
 Meanwhile, the accused refused to give blood and urine samples
 yadi blad or urine sample kii jaanch hoti, to nae tathy saamne aate
 There was also negligence in the CCTV footage case
 aaie jaanate hai police kii wo laaparvaahee, jo cese ko kamjor banaati hamedical jaanch:varnika kundu kii shikaayat par pahunchi police ne aaropee vikaas baraala or uske dost ashish ko giraftaar karke thane le ai
 After this, according to the rule, he had to undergo a medical examination
 police ne unhen medical ke liye bheja, jahaan aropiyon ne blad or urine sample dene se inkaar kar diya
 After this, the doctor sniffed them and found out in some other ways that they are terrible inebriated
 medical jaanch main bhi ye baat saamne ai he, lekin kya ye jaanch court main stand kar paaegi, ye bada sawaal he
 Removal and addition of non-bailable sections: The police had earlier registered a case against Vikas and his friend under sections 354-D, 341, 365, 511 of IPC and section 185 of Motor Vehicle Act on the complaint of Varnika
 lekin raat ko 3 baje dhara 365 or 511 ko hataa diya gaya
 It was added again today
 dhara 365 or 511 gaiyr-jamaanti dharaaen hai
 Now the police will have to answer in court why the currents were removed and added again and again
 vaastavik sisitivi footage kaa nahin milanaa:is vaardaat main sabase ahm saboot sisitivi footage sabit ho saktaa tha, lekin police ne pehle bataaya ki jin ilaakon se peedit or aropiyon kii car gujri vahaan ke sisitivi camere kharaab the
 However, the police later claimed that they had received footage from five places
 lekin baraamad footage na to car saaf najar aa rahi he, na hi uskaa number dikhaai de rahaa he
 In such a situation, it would be difficult to prove in court that the car that followed was of Vikas Barala

 ’dilli or mumbai kaa prastaavaioe ke sheersh adhikariyon ke dimag main mejabani ke liye dilli or mumbai kaa naam he par duusare shaharon ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 This is the first time the IOA has officially expressed their willingness to claim the Olympics
 unhone kaha,‘yah sirf pehla charan he, jab koi desh olympic kii boli ke liye ichha vyakt karata he or baad ke charnon main mejabaan shahar yaa shaharon ke naam kii ghoshnaa boli main karata he
 Earlier India had never expressed its desire to host the Olympic Games
 ’olympic 2032 ke liye boli prakriya kii shuruyaat 2022 main hogi or mejabaan shahar ke naam kii ghoshnaa 2025 main kii jaaegi
 Indonesia, which successfully hosted the Asian Games this year, has also expressed its willingness to bid for the Olympics
 isaki daud main china kaa shanghai shahar or australia kaa bristben shahar bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 North and South Korea may also express their desire to jointly host it, while Germany wants the 2032 Olympics to be held in 13 cities in the country

 mehta ne kaha ki hamen vibhinn sarkari agenciyon se guarantee bhi chahie lekin yah sab tabhi shuru hoga jab sarkaar is boli kaa samarthan karegi
 The government's stance has not been very encouraging on this matter

 Mehta said that we have told the government about the bid but there was no response from the Sports Ministry
 ioe ke str par hamane boli prakriya ke liye kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Whatever we can do is up to the rest of the government
 unhone kaha ki china ne olympic kii mejabani kii he or vah 2022 main sheetakaaleen olympic kii mejabani karegaa
 If South Korea can host the Olympics then why not India

 Regarding Owaisi's 'entry' in this election and sending Owaisi to spread 'poison' to cut the vote of the secular grand alliance led by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, he said that such betrayal happens in politics when It will be revealed when the election results are out, but Owaisi is a 'poison', if the politics of people like him will grow in this country and society, then the country once again collapses

 varsh ke ant main mujhe remand kaarvar kii baaten yaad aati hai
 His stories, which read 'what We Talk About, When We Talk About Love', have always reminded me of the slippery of meaning
 2017 main bharat kaa shahar kaarvar kii kahani ke ek paatr kii tarah laga
 The past year surprised me: What is it at the end of the year that we talked about while discussing the city
 is saal shahari charchaa kaa charitra tufaani, saahsee or apadhapi bharaa tha
 There were a lot of words around us like renewal, expansion and smart
 isane hamaari ummiido ko labalab bhar diya or ham intjaar karne lage ki inamen se sari ummiden yaa koi ek ummid hi kisi bindu par aakar faleebhoot ho jaae
 Smart city, house for everyone
 khule main shouch se mukt shahar or kasbe
 There was talk of metamorphosis, not of improvement or improvement
 yah smart, svachh or digital shahar kaa saal hone vaala tha
 Seemed like this would happen: This was the year that demonetisation started
 uske baad kya vruddhi kii sambhaavna kii kalpana bhi ja sakati he? baarah maheene baad us mahaan kayapalat kii shuruyaat kaa leshmaatr saboot bhi milanaa kathin ho gaya he
 The lakes of Bengaluru are still filled to the brim with gazes or fen, while efforts are on to expand continuously under a new master plan
 har saal kii tarah dilli kii sardiyon kii khatarnaak dhundh kaa aagaman ho chukaa tha, lekin shahar ab tak ek bhi bas nahin kharid paaya he, kaaron par niyantran nahin kar paaya he, yaa pradooshan niyantran ke liye koi charanbaddh kadam nahin uthaa paaya he
 The proof of how far we are from the metamorphosis floor in Mumbai was found when an accident occurred on the narrow bridge of Elphinstone Road railway station, which killed many people, and the city is still imagining the coastal road, which He is in dire need
 chennai main ennor creek kii aakhri daldali jameen ko ab bhi aakraamak dhang se chalaai ja rahi punarvikas kii nai yojanaon se sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he or shahar ko salanaa baadh kii samasya se jujhna pad rahaa he, kuch log to yah maanane lage hai ki in donon kaa koi atoot naata he
 One of the larger real estate clusters — Unitech — first collapsed and then collapsed
 rojgaar kii daren tham gayi, home lone kii byaaj daren gir gayi, phir bhi sabase garib tabaka gharon se vanchit rahaa
 New metros started in Lucknow, Kochi and Jaipur and cost a huge portion of the state budget, but 9 out of 10 people are still on foot or using buses or other means
 manaregaa (rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee kanoon) gramin bana rahaa or usee tarah rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan bhi—iskaa shahari mishan ab bhi kalpana main hi he or shahar ke nivasee kisi saamaajik suraksha jaisi yojana kaa anubhav tak nahin kar sakate hai
 Smart, metamorphosis and renewal — if put in humble language — sounds elusive
 ek tarah se yah yojanakaaron, niti-nirmaataaon or kayapalat ke thekedaaron kii mahaan yojanaon ke viruddh hamaare shaharon ke lacheelepan yaa sahanshakti kii tarif karne kaa saal tha
 i can say with full confidence that there is no small relief in this matter
 kisi bhavy vichaar kii vifaltaa—yaa kam se kam kaam ko vilambit karnaa—kisi saadhaaran or saamaanya vichaar kii uttarjivita bhi hoti he, shaharon par nagarikon kii uttarjivita, badi or bhavy pariyojnaon par har roj kii saamaanya suvidhaon kii uttarjivita, taatkaalik kayapalat par chote parivartanon kii uttarjivita, bade-bade mal par saadhaaran bazaaron kii uttarjivita, express ve par kai savaariyon vaale auto kii uttarjivita
 When a public policy stumbles, no one wins
 tab is ghatana ko kam se kam ek avasar ke taur par lenaa chahie
 The 'hum' people who read this magazine have an opportunity for humility once again
 agar ham ise grahan karte hai to yah koi choti uplabdhi nahin he
 The end of 2017 is a chance to hear more than speak, so that we can discover new words and try to understand with full truth and patience
 kaarvar or prem, isse kam kii maang nahin karte
 Carver could have asked us about so many things about smartness, what is that we could talk about
 misaal ke taur par hamane avaidh rup se rahane ke mulyon ke bare main baat nahin kii
 Most of the Indian people in our cities live somewhere by encircling and building houses on it
 agar hamane rahane kii is jagah ko 'jhuggiyaan' na kahkar inhen gambhirtha ke saath makaan ke rup main liya hota to hamen ehsaas hota ki makaanon kii kami kii samasya kaa yah ek acha samaadhaan ho saktaa tha, na ki samasya kaa vistaar
 This will change our thinking about real estate
 yah hamen dikhaata ki unitech kii asafalataa koi bahut badi ghatana nahin he balki real estate ke bazaar kii simaaon kii ek aprihaary sthiti he or bazaar kii us seemaa main 80 pratishat shahari log pravesh nahin kar sakate
 If we had done this, we could have found a new definition about housing — protecting and supporting people's settlements already built, rather than focusing on what to do in Unitech's case
 yah sambhav haih jab odisha ne saal ke aakhri maheenon main 2,00,000 jhuggivaasiyon ko unki jameen kaa adhikaar de diya to badi khamoshi ke saath yah aisi yojana ban gai jo sachmuch bahut shandaar he, or sabase mahatvapurn yah ki badi chaturaai ke saath ise 'smart' naam nahin diya gaya
 We can remind ourselves that the importance of repair and recombination can help change our relationship with the word 'framework' after which our thinking can only be drawn to gleaming digital drawings, deserted lands, bullet trains, expressways and glass buildings
 It is not limited
 ham usase aage nikal kar soch sakate the
 Instead, we could talk about the slow development of local train stations whose bridges could be inspected and repaired in time, a housing colony in which they would have underground sewers, markets where New tents could be erected by giving licenses and they could be replaced by shopkeepers, pavements where shopkeepers and pedestrians could be built, making room for car parking
 There would be room for both of them
 ham apni maujuuda seva vyavasthaaon—swasthya, shiksha, parivahan ho, pani yaa swatchta—ke bare main soch sakate the ki unhen ek-duusare se kaise joda ja saktaa he
 By doing this we could consider all the ways in which all houses in our cities could get water — tankers, shared pipes, community stand-posts, private connections, water main lines, jugadoo connections and 'leaks' —not That in line with our big paper plans
 aisa karne kaa arth hota ki aaj bhi hamaari samasyaon kaa samaadhaan smart shahar nahin balki eemaruti (atal mishan for rijuveniton and urban transformation) he
 It is not so much glitter but the root cause of the problems
 rihaaish kaa avaidh thikaana banaao, thikthak karo or jameen jamaa lo
 This is the language that persists even after extinguishing the spotlight and the last guest of the opening
 yojanakaar jo us smartnes kii baat nahin karte, jo sudhaar kii jagah kayapalat kii tasviir pesh karte hai
 Planners, who begin with 'who we are', whose roots lie in the way our cities have been built so far, which do not speak of models anywhere other than our own roads
 ye ve yojanakaar hai jo jaanate hai ki parivartan main samay or dhairya kii jarurat hoti he
 In 2018, we need to understand our cities with humility, not with arrogance that we can transform them whenever we want
 kaarvar hamen bataate hai ki prem ko keval jaanane kii jagah use samajhane kaa yahi tarika he
 His talk about cities also applies

 In a large part of the country, there has been a ruckus about the problem of farmers

 Amidst all this, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Thursday wrote to the Prime Minister, saying that the government should enact such a law in the forthcoming monsoon session, after which farmers should not depend on the kindness of governments to increase the minimum support price
 piem ko likhe patr main unhone suzav diya he ki nunatam samarthan mulya kisaan kii laagat se 50 fisadi zyada hona chahie
 In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sitaram Yechury has said that during his election campaign you had promised farmers that farmers will get 50 percent more profit than the cost price, but the price that farmers are getting for their crops right now is from the cost price
 Is too much
 seetaram yechuri ne modi ko apane patr main likhaa he ki ek nahin balki tamaam rajyon main kisaan andolan karne ko majaboor ho rahe hai or badi sankhya main kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai
 The condition of farmers from Madhya Pradesh to Maharashtra is very bad and farmers have been forced to hit the road, so the government should take immediate steps and bring a law in the next parliament session as soon as possible so that the farmers get the right compensation for their hard work

 Speaking to news agency IANS, 88-year-old Doctor Singh, a former J&K state governor, Sadre princely state and governor, told them to be cautious as they include legal, political, constitutional and emotional factors
 unhone kaha ki inaki puri samiksha kii jaani chahie
 The relationship between central and state government also creates an equation of sensitivity
 doctor singh ne kaha ki is samasya ke chaar ahm pahalu hai
 The international aspect is first connected, because 45 percent of the state's area and 30 percent of the population (since 26 October 1947) has gone out in the last years
 unhone pakistan ke saath china kaa bhi naam lete hue kaha ki donon deshon ne hamaara kshetra hathiyaa liya he
 We can remain in denial and talk of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir every time, but Shaksgam and Yarkand river basins adjoining the territory of Gilgit, Baltistan and the northern regions, mainly Aksai China and Karakoram, are left out

 doctor singh ne kaha ki darasal 1963 tak antim hisse ko pakistan adhikrut jammu-kashmir kaa hissaa mana jaataa tha
 It is easy to say that Kashmir is ours, but i have been in Delhi for 50 years and i have not seen the pain of this bad state in Delhi and India
 sirf dikhaawati prem pradarshit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The merger is final and irrevocable
 main iske vajood par sawaal nahin uthaa rahaa hum
 The Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly confirmed the merger and validated it
 isliye isaki satyata par koi sawaal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Legally, morally and constitutionally, the state is a part of India
 ''vilay ke dinon ko kiya yaddoctor karn singh ne jammu kashmir ke bharat main vilay ke dinon ko yaad karte hue kaha ki jab baapuji (maharaja hari singh) ne jammu main vilay sandhi par hastakshar kiye the to unhone sirf teen muddon par hastakshar kiye the
 Under the merger treaty, Jammu and Kashmir had surrendered only three subjects, which included defense, foreign affairs and communication with India
 unhone bharat se aashwaasan liya tha ki jammu-kashmir ke log apni samvidhan sabha ke jariye apane samvidhan kaa masauda taiyaar karenge, jo hua bhi
 "I called the Constituent Assembly on the basis of the Delhi Agreement between Pandit Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah
" pradesh kii samvidhan sabha dwaara jammu-kashmir kaa samvidhan banaaya gaya or 26 janvari 1957 ko mere hastakshar se vah kanoon ban gaya

 "even after 72 years, three divisions have not been integrated," Dr
 Singh said that regional aspirations also cannot be ignored
 jammu kashmir ab teen spasht bhashaai or bhugolic sambhaagon main banta hua he
 The three divisions - Jammu, Kashmir Valley and Ladakh - have not been integrated even after a period of 72 years
 unhone maanavtaavaadi pahalu kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki puri ghati main kabristaan hai
 Thousands of people have lost their lives
 unhone kaha ki kashmiri panditon ko apane ghar se palaayan karnaa padaa he or anek log abhi tak jammu or udhampur ke shiviron main nivas kar rahe hai
 Dogra has never received the respect he deserves

 Significantly, Modi government 2
 0 kaa dhyaan vivaadit masalon ke samaadhaan par he
 The issue of removing Article 370 was also included in the Bharatiya Janata Party's pre-election manifesto
 grih mantri amit shah vivaadit masalon kaa hameshaa ke liye samaadhaan karne kii koshish main jute hai
 There is speculation about the removal of Articles 35A and 370 due to the deployment of additional troops of Jammu and Kashmir

 The trumpet for the Himachal Assembly elections is over and the political temperature has become very hot here
 bijepi dobaaraa se satta main vaapasi kii raah banane kii jugat main hai to vahiin congress main shah-maat kaa khel chal rahaa he
 a political tussle continues between Congress state president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu and CM Virbhadra Singh these days
 congress ne somvaar komukhyamantri virbhadra sinhako rajya main party prachaar samiti kaa pramukh banaaya
 Virbhadra has been given this responsibility by removing state Congress chief Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu
 jabaki teen din pehle hi congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne sukkhu ko prachaar samiti kaa adhyaksh or virbhadra ko uskaa sadsy banaaya tha
 But Virbhadra was successful in putting pressure on the Congress high command and he won the game
 ab himachal main congress ummidavaaron kaa faisla sukkhu nahin balki virbhadra singh karenge
 In the last election, between Virbhadra vs Kaul, there are political enthusiasts of the 2017 Assembly in Matahimachal but the condition of Congress looks similar to 2012
 paanch saal main vakt kitna badal gaya, lekin virbhadra nahin badale hai
 In the 2012 assembly elections, Virbhadra was fighting a battle of political supremacy with the then state president Kaul Singh Thakur
 kaul or virbhadra donon log us vakt congress ke siem kaa cheharaa banane ke koshish main the
 This was the reason that Virbhadra Singh was constantly cursing Kaul Singh Thakur
 itnaa hi nahin NCP main jane kii baaten bhi chalane lagi thi
 Kaur Singh Thakur was pacified by the Congress in front of Virbhadra's rebellious attitude
 satta ke liye congress virbhadra ke aage jhuki thivirbhadra ko chunaav prachaar samiti kaa pramukh to banaaya hi gaya tha, alaakaman ne kai meetingon ke baad unhen pradesh adhyaksh bhi bana hi diya
 Actually all the mlas close to Virbhadra had rallied with him
 himachal main baari-baari se sarkarein badalati rahi he
 In such a situation, the Congress number was going to come
 congress alaakaman nahin chahta tha ki yah mauka haath se jaae satta main aane kaa
 Therefore, he kneeled down before Virbhadra
 virbhadra congress ko sarkaar main laane main kaamyaab bhi rahe or phir unhone mukhyamantri banane par congress pradeshdhyaksh pad chhod diya tha
 The thirty-six-figure election between Virbhadra and Sukkhu is in the same manner as Virbhadra Singh, who is known to Kaul Singh Thakurse Adawat in 2012, is on the same lines
 pichley dinon virbhadra singh ne congress alaakaman se chitthee likhakar kaha tha ki pradesh main yahi haal rahaa to vah chunaav nahin ladenge
 After this, his special and cabinet minister Prakash Chaudhary said that if he does not fight, i will not fight also and the rest of the mlas also have the same opinion
 darasal sukkhu rahul ke kareebi maane jate hai or virbhadra sonia kheme se
 But Virbhadra is a reckless emperor of Himachal Pradesh's politics, having been the chief minister of the state many times
 isiilie congress ne unki naaraazgi ko dekhte hue philhal sukkhu ko said line karte hue soobe main chunaav samiti kii kaman unhen saunp di he
 Congress state president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu is running keeping more than 2022 in mind
 isiilie ve philhal virbhadra ke aage jhuk gaye hai
 The deteriorating governments made up of five percent votes tell that in Himachal, the government reverses by a margin of few percent votes in changing governments
 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad jab bijepi satta main ai thi, tab use 43
 The vote was 78 percent and the Congress 38
 90 fisadi
 But in the 2012 assembly elections, the case was reversed
 bijepi kaa vot share ghatakar 38
 Left 47 percent and Congress 42
 81 fisadi ho gaya
 It is clear from this that the attitude of four to five and a half to five and a half percent voters decides whose government is to be formed

 He has given the world many reasons to discuss the fashion of leaders

 On such occasions they opt for light colored pastel-shedded kurtas

 co / 32pltut3ge is saal agast main landan main rahul gandhi ne 1984 ke sikh-virdohi dangon main congress or apane parivaar kaa haath na hone kii baat kahi thi
 But after the Delhi High Court on December 17 convicted Sajjan Kumar of killing five Sikhs, the issue has come back to chase the Congress once again
 sajjan kumaar—doshi qaraar die gaye pehle congressi netaa—ko sajaa dilaane main 34 saal lag gaye
 In a reversal of the 2013 acquittal from the trial court, Justice S
C
 of the High Court
 muralidhar or vinod goyal kii peeth ne mana ki siyaasi varadahast hone ke kaaran kai apradhi mukademe or sajaa se batch gaye the
 The investigation into those riots began in 2005 when the inquiry was handed over to the CBI on the recommendation of Justice Nanavati Commission
 upie-1 sarkaar kii mukhya ghatak congress ne shuru main sajjan kumaar or jagadish titalar (tatkaaleen kendriya mantri) ke khilaaf ayog ke nishkarshon ko khaarij kar diya tha
 But the Manmohan Singh government had to bow down in 2005 after a huge uproar
 jajon ne ullekh kiya ki sibiai ko in maamalon ko saunpane ke liye 10 ayog or samitiyaan gathit kerani padin
 The 203-page judgment of the High Court confirmed the same thing that everyone has known for years
 peeth ne yachikakarta jagadish cor kii us gavaahi ko sweekaar kiya jisamen unhone sajjan kumaar (jo un dinon bahari dilli ke saansad the) ko dangaiyon ko uksaate hue dekhne kii baat kahi thi
 Kaur overhears them saying, "sikh brother-in-law should not be saved
" jo hindu bhai unako sharan detaa he, uskaa ghar bhi jala do or unako bhi maaro
 "kaur said that he overheard the police in-charge who was asking the rioters," How many chickens have been roasted
 '' cor ko in varshon main bahut mushkil din dekhne pade
 He was not only dismissed as 'non-trustworthy' (according to the trial court in 2013) but also jailed for 9 years on a false charge under the Terrorist and Destructive Activity (TADA) Act
 un dangon main dilli main 2,733 or anya rajyon main 3,350 sikh maare gaye the
 The High Court also said that similar massacres took place in Mumbai in 1993, Gujarat in 2002, Kandhamal in 2008 and Muzaffarnagar in 2013, a new law is needed to prevent such crimes against humanity

 Worrying about the recent hurts in Maharashtra and the economy from above - GDP growth rate 4
 5 fisad par simtane—ke saath hi pyaaj kii lagaataar badhati keemton ko dekhte hue jharkhand vidhansabha kaa chunaav bhaajapa ke chunavi pradarshan kaa ek mahatvapurn barometer sabit ho saktaa he
 The NDA has lost power in four states — Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra — in the last 11 months
 30 november ko pehle charan main rajya kii 81 main se 13 siton par matdaan ho chukaa he
 Four stages of voting are yet to be held till December 20 before the results are announced on 23 December
 mana jaataa he ki vidhansabha chunaav main rashtriya muddon se zyada sthaneey mudde hi prabhavi hote hai or log alag tarah se matdaan karte hai
 Yet the BJP continues to rely on 'modi's charisma'
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or grih mantri amit shah pehle hi rajya main chunaav prachaar kar chuke hai
 The party has the advantage of one thing psychologically — in all the elections held in Jharkhand so far, each time the BJP has emerged as the single largest party
 raghubar das—rajya main paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa karne vaale pehle mukhyamantri—ne vikaas kaaryon se apni acchhee chhavi bana rakhi he
 For this reason, the bjp-led NDA won 12 seats in the Lok Sabha elections in May and the BJP alone got 51 percent votes
 itnaa hi nahin, 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main haalanki jharkhand mukti morcha, jharkhand vikaas morcha or congress in teenon dalon ko bhaajapa-ol jharkhand students union (ajasu) party gathbandhan ko mili kareeb 35 fisad ke mukaable 44 fisad vot mili the lekin in teenon dalon ko kul 33 siten hi hasil ho pai thim
 In contrast, the NDA had got 42 seats, in which BJP had 37 and AJSU got 5 seats
 is tarah endie ko 82 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main saadhaaran bahumat mil gaya tha
 But the opposition says that the BJP got good results in the state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, yet in the assembly elections held in the same year, the party could get only 37 seats and in these 37 seats also in 8 seats, it won by 5,000 votes
 Won by a very small margin
 haal ke varshon main rajya main hue upachunaavon main bhi party kaa pradarshan bahut kharaab rahaa tha
 Out of the 5 seats in which the BJP contested the by-elections between December 2015 and December 2018, it has won only one seat while the two seats it contested, its ally Ajsu, lost both seats
 
 iske alaava san 2000 main gathit is rajya main bhaajapa pehali baar akele hi chunaav maidan main he
 Ajsu, who was a partner in the government, who contested the Lok Sabha elections along with the BJP, has split from the NDA this time
 sudesh mahato ke netritv vaali is party ne 53 siton par apane ummidavaar khadey kiye hai
 If its strategy of attracting backward caste voters in general and mainly Mahato fraternity is successful, it will hurt the BJP itself
 udhar, das ke liye cabinet main unke sahyogi rahe sarayu raay ek alag chunauti honge
 It would not be easy to defeat Rai, who was contesting from Jamshedpur East seat of Das after the ticket was cut from the BJP, although Das has never lost an election in his career, winning by 70,000 votes in 2014
 is bich rahul gandhi rajya main sakriy rup se chunaav prachaar kar rahe hai or kisaanon ke liye kalyankari yojanaon kaa vaada kar rahe hai
 The Congress is part of the jmm-led coalition this time, making Hemant Soren the chief ministerial candidate
 mahagathbandhan rajya main adivasee voton kaa 26
 3 percent is expecting to draw a share
 soobe kii 82 main se 28 siten adivaasiyon ke liye arakshit hai
 The state presidents of Congress, JMM and Jharkhand Vikas Morcha are tribals
 baharhaal, bhaajapa ke liye sukun kii baat yah he ki 2014 ke chunaav main use adivaasiyon ke liye arakshit 28 siton main 11 siton par jeet mili thi jo jhamumo ke baraabar hi thi
 Munda tribals have traditionally voted in favor of the BJP
 iske alaava bhaajapa sankhya kii drushti se mahatvapurn pichhadi jatiyon main gaiyr-yadav, gaiyr-muslim or gaiyr-adivasee voton ko hasil karne kii ummid kar rahi he
 The BJP wants to project Das as a backward caste leader as he is of Teli caste and the first non-tribal chief minister of the state
 bhaajapa ne ajasu ke liye apane daravaaje band nahin kiye hai
 Says a senior party leader, "our fate is linked to Ajsu's performance
" unhen milane vaala har vot hamaare khate kaa hi hoga
 For example, the party has not announced its candidate's name from Silli assembly seat against AJSU chief Mahato
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki chunaav nateeja aane ke baad jarurat padane par isse donon ke bich talmail bithaana aasaan rahegaa
 Meanwhile, Javimo chief Babulal Marandi is trying to make it a triangular contest
 sabhi 81 siton par apane ummidavaar khadey karke jhavimo kareeb 20 siten jeetne kii ummid kar rahaa he
 Marandi is expected to play the role of kingmaker in the hung assembly
 ve sorain kaa netritv sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 The vote bank of JMM and JVM is the same - tribal in general and Santal in particular
 sutron ke mutabik, marandi ko dar tha ki hemanth kaa netritv sweekaar karne se unka kad chota ho saktaa he or ve apana vot bhi ganvaa sakate hai
 The jmm-congress-rjd coalition is believed to have only 10 seats for Marandi, which was unacceptable for a person who had once been the chief minister of the state for 28 months

 pump ke sahare di menuali oxijanpaanchavin main padhanevaali vandana ko abhi mahaz do din pehle hi to maamuli sa bukhaar hua tha
 But who would have thought that this fever would take away her dearly forever from the mother
 doctoron ne unhenspataal main oxigenkhatm hone kii baat kehete hue ek baloon jaisi chiz dekar use lagaataar pump kar vandana ko menuali oxigen dete rahane ko kaha
 From time to time, at the behest of the doctors, sometimes there was bloodshed and sometimes there was a rush of family members for drugs

 yahaan tak ki poochne par doctoron ne unhen daant-dapat kar bhaga diya
 Without paper or post mortem, the people told that till the night in the hospital, there were only a few doctors who were looking at one and a half hours, while five-six doctors were asking about the condition of each patient and this was a sign of untoward
 iske baad had to tab ho gai, jab chupake se ek bachche kii laash unke gharavaalon ko dekar unhen bagaiyr kisi kaagaj yaa postmortem ke aspataal ke pichley darvaaze se jane ko kah diya gaya
 But this death figure was large, the secret could not be hidden

 grahon main shanidev ko karmon kaa fal dena vaala grah mana gaya he
 Shanidev is the only god whom people worship out of fear
 lekin aisa nahin he shani dev nyaay ke devtaa hai jo insaan ko uske karm ke hisaab se fal dete hai
 It has often been seen that oil is offered on Shani Dev on Kishanivara and a lamp of mustard oil is also burnt
 tel or shani ke bich kya sambandh he? aisa kyon he ki shanidev ko tel chadhaaya jaataa he? shanidev ko tel chadhaane ke peeche do puranic kathaayen prachlit hai
 Let's know the reason for offering oil to Shani Dev and its story
 
 
 pehali katha kaa sambandh he ravanashanidev ko tel chadhaane ke liye yah puranic katha kaaphi prachlit he
 Ravana is believed to have crushed his ego and had captured all the planets with his force
 shanidev ko bhi usne bandigrah main ulataa lataka diya tha
 At the same time, Hanumanji became a messenger of Lord Rama
 ravan ne ahankaar main aakar hanumaji kii poonch main aag lagava di thi
 Enraged by this, Hanumanji burned the whole of Lanka, Lanka burned and all the planets were freed, but due to hanging upside down, Shani's body was in terrible pain and he was groaning with pain
 shani ke dardako shant karne ke liye hunamanji ne unke sharir par tel se maalish kii thi or shani ko dard se mukt kiya tha
 At the same time, Shani had said that anyone who will pour oil on me with devotion and devotion will get freedom from all problems
 tabhi se shanidev par tel chadhaane kii parampara shuru ho gai thi
 According to the second story, there was a war in Shani Dev and Hanumanji
 According to the second story, Shani Dev once boasted of his strength and might
 lekin us kaal main bhagwaan hanuman ke bal or parakram kii kirti chaaron dishaao main faili hui thi
 When Shani Dev came to know about Lord Hanuman, he set out to fight with Lord Hanuman
 jab bhagwaan shani hanumanji ke paas pahunche to dekha ki bhagwaan hanuman ek shant sthaan par apane swami shriram kii bhakthi main leen baithe he
 Shanidev challenged the war on seeing him
 jab bhagwaan hanuman neshnidev kii yuddh kii lalkarsuni to vah shanidev ko samajhane pahunche
 But Shanidev did not listen to one thing and was determined to fight
 iske baad bhagwaan hanuman or shanidev ke bich ghamaasan yuddh hua
 In the battle, Shanidev was badly injured after losing to Lord Hanuman, due to which his body started suffering
 iske baad bhagwaan ne shanidev ko tel lagane ke liye diya, jisase unka puraa dard gaayab ho gaya
 That is why Shanidev said that the person who will give me oil with true mind
 main uski sabhi pidaa har luungaa or sabhi manokamanaayen puri karuunga
 For this reason, the tradition of offering oil to Shani Dev has started since then and Saturday is the day of Shanidev and by offering oil to Shani Dev on this day, your wishes are fulfilled soon

 At the same time, he later denied that he was involved in the terrorist attack
 kasaab ne yah daawa tab kiya jab nyaayadhish tahaliani ne jaananaa chaha ki kya use maare gaye aatankwaadiyon ke bare main kuch kahana he
 These terrorists were identified by eyewitnesses
 jab nyaayadhish ne poocha ki use kaise pataa chalaa ki abu ismail mumbai kaa tha to kasaab ne kaha, ‘‘main uske chehre se bataa saktaa hum
 "on this, Judge Tahaliyani asked lightly," Does he sound like a Marathi manoos
 ’’shuruyaat main apana gunaah kabool karne ke baad kasaab ne haal main mumbai hamale main apni sanliptata se inkaar kiya tha
 He told the court that he had arrived in India a few days before the Mumbai attack from Pakistan by Samjhauta Express and was arrested by the police from Girgaum Chowpatty a day before the terror attack

 When asked about the statement of Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, Tariq said that Shinde would have said such a thing as a formality

 He said that Shinde has worked with Sharad Pawar for a long time
 unke mukhyamantritvakaal main vah mantri rahe the, isliye yah unki vyaktigat raay ho sakati he
 Tariq made it clear from the NCP that Pawar is not in the race for the post of Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki pavaar main pradhanmantri banane kii sabhi kshamtaayen hai, kyonki raajnneeti ke kshetra main jitna lanbaa anubhav unhen he, utana desh main kam hi rajanetaaon ko he
 Tariq said that in a democracy, sports are true figures which he (pawar) does not have and if that were the case, he could have definitely become the Prime Minister

 He said that Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of that state at the time of the riots and it was difficult to have any FIR and police action against him
 shuru se hi tamaam sabooton ko mitaane kii koshish kii gayi
 Modi may have been freed from the allegations, but this is the truth and people also believe that if he had played the role of Chief Minister properly and tried to stop the riots, then perhaps the stain on his face is, It does not happen
 tarik ne kaha ki bijepi or narendra modi ko baar-baar isko lekar jo safai deni pad rahi he, uski vajah yah he ki aisi ghatnaayen huin, jiske kaaran aaj bhi vah andeh ke ghere main hai
 Asking the Aam Aadmi Party's success in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party asked about the danger to other parties, Tariq Anwar said that the reason for the success of the said party in Delhi was Anna Hazare's movement which affected the people of Delhi

 akshay kumaar ne kuch saal pehle ek aisa kaam kiya tha jo aamtaur par bollywood abhinayta nahin karte hai
 Actually Akshay got the Best Actor Award in the film Singh Is King
 akshay ye aword paakar kaaphi khush bhi the haalanki unhone apana ye aword aamir khan ko dedicket kar diya tha kyonki unhen us saal ai film gazani main aamir kaa kaam bahut pasand aayaa tha
 With the 2008 film Ghajini, Aamir broke several Bollywood records and Akshay too could not live without praising Aamir after watching this film
 akshay ne is video main kaha tha ki 'main behad khush hum
 i have wanted this award for myself for the last 18 years
 maine kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki ek chandani chowk ke ladke ke saath kabhi aisa hoga
 i am happy that people have given me so much love but i am standing here taking my dream in my hands and i want to say one thing to everyone
 kuch dinon pehle maine aamir khan kii film gazani dekhi thi or main us film ko dekhakar dang rah gaya tha
 After this, while watching Mumbai from London, i saw his film Singh is King
 main naa chaahate hue bhi donon hi filmon kii tulana karne laga
 Then i realized that according to me, Aamir Khan should be the best actor of this year for Ghajini

 i heartily thank all of you, but Aamir, friend for you, because you feel it

 Before the meeting, Annane, while talking to the media, condemned Kejriwal's decision, denouncing Yogendra and Prashant from the party

 Anna said - No clap with one hand: When asked about the ongoing dispute between Lt

 anna ne kaha, 'tali ek haath se nahin bajati
 On Sunday, Anna, protesting against the Modi government at Jantar Mantar in Delhi, demanded to implement the 'one Rank One Pension' (OROP) soon in the interest of soldiers

 In Bollywood, heroines who pull the bridge to compliment their film's hero and director are said to be sensible
 or minisha lamba ne bhi kam samajhadaari nahin dikhaai
 When he was cast by director Sanjay Gadvi in 'kidnap', he had no words to praise him
 us daur main to donon ke rishte itane majboot the ki 'kidanap' kii naakaami ke liye minisha ne unhen clin chit de di thi
 It was believed that the real reason for Minisha's love was during the making of Gadhavi's Kidnap, to cast her in her next film, which she believed was true
 lekin jab gadavi ne agali film kii yojana banaai, to heroin ke liye priyanka chopra se lekar jiya khan tak har kisi badi heroin ke saamne parade kar daali, lekin unki list main minisha kaa kahin bhi naam nahin tha
 Perhaps this is the reason that when they mention 'kidnap', they ask - Who Sanjay Gadvi?

 In a hurry, Dharmendra was taken to the BHU Trauma Center, where doctors declared him dead
 vaardaat ke baad police ghatnasthal se lekar ilaake ke sisitivi khangaal rahi he
 It is being told that Dharmendra had a pipe shop in Pandeypur and he often used to come home with the sale money
 somvaar ko bhi vah paison se bharaa bag lekar jaise hi pahunche, pehle se ghaat lagaae badmaashon ne bag chhinane kii koshish kii
 Dharmendra protested and the miscreants shot him
 is ghatana ke baad ilaake main dar kaa maahaul he
