 party adhyaksh amit shah ke kathan ke baad ravivaar ko kendriya mantri dharmendra pradhan ne kaha ki sudesh hamaare mitra or bhai jaise hai or vah sarkaar main shaamil honge
 However, AJSU leader Sudesh Mahato says that currently friendship with BJP will not be wrestled in the electoral fray
 dharmendra pradhan ravivaar ko jharkhand ke kai vidhansabha ilaaqon main chunavi sabha ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 His statement is being made politically that despite all the claims to the party that it is the feedback that the result of the assembly elections is going to be hung, he will definitely need an old ally like Sudesh Mahto
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi isse purv ek tivi channel ke kaarykram main saafe kiya tha ki ajasu unke bhavishya ke sarkaar main shaamil hogi
 Let us tell you that when the BJP did not give 17 seats to the nominal seats of Sudesh Mahato, then his party fielded more than twenty candidates

 (ieenes se input) If a right-wing organization had written the story of Padmavat, they might not have done this better than Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 jaraa gaur kariye, allaudin khilji bilkul rakshas he, jisaki tulana yamraj or ravan se hoti he
 Rajputs are the winners' community
 rani padmavati shiv kii tarah jehar pine vaali he
 What would you say if such an impression was formed after watching the film? This film tries to make you proud of Rajput and Hindu kings
 rajput aise bahadur log hai jo haarate nahin, agar ve haarate bhi hai to zyada balashaali vipakshi sena kii vajah se nahin, balki chook or dhokhe kii vajah se
 Rani Padmavati is not a weak-willed woman who accepts defeat but is a warrior queen who strategizes the army and the war
 jab ve khilji ko pratibimb ke rup main apana cheharaa dikhaati hai to bhagwaan shankar kii tarah apane logon ke hit ke liye jaanboojhkar jehar piti hai
 She is like Savitri, who fights with Yamaraja to bring her husband Satyavan alive, powerful like mother Kali who destroys asuras
 kya yah aisi kahani nahin he, jo sangh parivaar or uske kisi bhi samarthak ko gauravanvit kare? kahani is dharna ko majboot karti he ki yah 'bure muslim' (jo afghanistan ke raste bharat aane vaala videshi he) or 'achche hindu' kii ladaai he
 Khilji is a barbaric miscreant, Bhansali has shown Khalji and his army completely black and Ratan Singh and his army in white clothes
 kai tarah ke prashasinak sudhaaron ko anjaam dene vaale khilji ko is tarah se dikhaaya gaya he, ki vah aisa badmaash he jiske andar kaayade kaa koi gun nahin he
 He eats like a boar, is carnal like an animal and is a fighter who has no respect
 kya vah rani padmavati kii sundarataa par mohit ho jaataa he? ji nahin, vah sirf sundarataa kii vajah se use hasil karne kii hasarat nahin karata, balki sach to yah he ki chittod kaa ek raajpurohit use bataata he ki padmavati uske takadir badalane kii kunjee he
 Your respect for Khilji, who loves a woman, is also not going to grow, because after all he is a barbaric attacker who often prefers to be with his slave Malik Kafur
 yahaan malik kafoor ko nakhrebaaj, chaapluus, kaamuk homosexual kii tarah dikhaaya gaya he, jo apane maalik ke prati vafaadaar he
 More than the imagination, it could have been shown even better on the basis of popular history and popular stories
 bas ek sach dikhataa he ki rajput raja khilji ke khilaaf ekajute nahin ho paae the, isliye ratan singh ko akele ladanaa padaa
 In this 'crusade' of 'truth' and 'untruth', only Rani Padmavati was left to advise her
 film kahani ko rochak banaati he
 Even when the fight took place face to face, it was not about military skills
 chittod kii haar khilji kii sabase badi haar thi, kyonki 'khilji ke haath lagane se pehle padmavati kaa sharir raakh ho jayega'
 Not only this, Ratan Singh offers a brave fight to Khilji - 'rajputs do not attack the injured and helpless
 'jab khilji apane joshilay bhaashanon se apane sainikon kaa manobal badhaakaryuddh kii taiyaarikar rahaa tha, to ratan singh har hindu tyohaar manaakar apane kile ke logon kaa utsaah badha rahe the
 Not only this, Khilji waited for six months in the desert like a ghost

 This statement can logically be called ironic in many ways
 awwal to yah bayaan ateet ke ek or bhaashan kii yaad dilaa rahaa tha-akashwani par tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi kaa 11 november, 1975 ko diya bhaashan jisamen unhone desh ko asthir karne kii koshish main lage “videshi haath” kaa masalaa uthaaya tha
 That same year, his "foreigner" was the biggest tool to defend the Emergency imposed in the same year
 modi kaa bhaashan isliye bhi ajeeb tha kyonki unki sarkaar aisi kisi bhi sajeesh kaa sakshya muhaiyaa kara paane main naakaam rahi he
 In contrast, a series of conspiracies have taken birth around Kanhaiya's arrest
 masalan, adaalat main tamashbin banakar khadi police ke saamne vakeelon dwaara kii gai uski pitayee or us tepe se chhedchhad jiskaa istemaal kathith rup se rajdroh ko sabit karne main kiya gaya tha
 The revelations that have been made this week, mostly by India Today TV, show that Kanhaiya may not have been among those shouting slogans of India in the JNU campus, that the slogan "pakistan Zindabad" was a TV channel
 Wrongly slapped her, while nothing was clearly heard, the lawyers claimed that she was instigated by the Delhi Police in beating Kanhaiya in the court premises Lee was
 dilli police ne bhale hi kagajaat taiyaar kar liya ho jisamen uskaa daawa he ki tivi footage or gavaahon ke aadhaar par uske paas kanhaiya ke khilaaf sakshya maujuud hai, lekin abhi uski adalati samiksha baaki he
 The Union Home Minister seems insensitive to say that JNU students have the support of lashkar-e-taiba founder Hafiz Saeed
 iskaa aadhaar shaayad ek farji twitor handls par kii gai tippanee thi
 It also cannot be denied that it is a violent clash of ideologies (sunil Khilnani), a confrontation over the idea of india (idea of india) and a battle to dominate the new rise of patriotism that has political and social implications
 desh ke pratishthit shaikshanik sansthaanon main do chaatr guton ke bich hui maamuli jhadap se shuru hua yah prakaran ek aisi buniyadi bahes main tabdeel ho chukaa he jiske nihitarth is sarkaar ke janadesh, samvidhan kii vyakhya, asahmati ke adhikaar kii ahmiyat or loktantric bharat main hasil naagarik swatantraaa ke lihaaj se kaaphi gahare hai
 There are some other questions to be answered
 masalan, bhartiya rajya main hindutv kii bhoomika, rashtrawaad kii paribhaasha or bhartiya dand samhita ke anuchhed 124e main rajdroh kaa kanoon, jo angreji raaj kaa avshesh he or aazaadee ke 68 saal baad bhi aaj vibhinn sarkarein ise hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal kar rahi hai
 The battle for survival for JNU (BJP leader and editor Chandan Mitra recently wrote that the government should take advantage of this opportunity and close JNU), it has also emerged as an opportunity for Hindutva rightist Has waged a new war so that it can advance its social and cultural agenda
 lekin vidambnaa yah he ki yah agenda “sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas” ke modi ke us vaade ke khilaaf he jiske sahare unhone 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav jeeta tha
 What is the real reason for this conflict? Why, who did it and what are its objectives
 yah samajhane ke liye pehle mauka-e-vaardaat par ek najar daalana jaruri he
 Jawaharlal Nehru University is a vibrant institution like any large public institution in Fiza
 yahaan alag-alag prishthbhumi ke vividh vichaaron vaale chaatr khulkar apni bhaawanaaon ko abhivyakt karte hai
 There is a diversity of emotions and sensations here and that is why sometimes many contradictory voices are seen on the same day, many changes can be seen in the mood

 asahmati ke itihaas or samvaad kii parampara vaale is santhaan se haalanki pichley hafte ye saare rang nadaarad rahe
 Instead, here in Fiza, a slight smell and an energy is constantly being realized, which is not very clear
 galat na samajhen-yah rashtradroh kii nahin, inkulab kii gandh he
 The students' union and teachers union of the university - in Rabindranath's words - has declared its independence through "narrow mutual walls"

 Two days after his arrest, Shehla Rashid Shora, vice-president of Students Union and student of mphil, in a flat speech without a mic, directly attacked the RSS, saying that those who do not respect the national flag or the Constitution are traitors
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne bhi is baat se sahmati jataai, ye baat alag he ki pichley do dashak se zyada vakt se ve jeenyu ke liye apriy hai lekin taatkaalik sankat ke maddenjar unke samarthan kaa yahaan swaagat hi kiya gaya
 On February 22, Sonia said, "an organization that did not participate in the freedom movement, which never showed any respect for the Father of the Nation and who never showed any reverence for the national flag, has patriotism and nationalism There should be hardly any right to share the title 
 ”pehle do chaatr guton ke bich kii ladaai main jabaran kudakar or phir bina kisi thos sakshya ke rajdroh jaisaa gambhir aarope lagaakar centre sarkaar ne jis nirankush tareeke se is masale ko bartaa he, vah use koi laabh dene nahin ja rahaa he

 Among them, the only Muslim Khalid has been the real target because there are so many "evidences" against him, which are either circumstantial or seem far-fetched
 masalan, ativampanthi or naastik khalid ke khilaaf ek pramukh aarope yah he ki usne farvari kii shuruyaat main kashmir, khadi or bangladesh main chaar dinon ke bheetar 800 se zyada baar phone kiya
 As noted by JNU alumnus and Bollywood actress Swara Bhaskar, this means that she has made nine calls every hour and during this time she has not slept at all
 khalid ke naam ek khule patr main swara ne likhaa he, “or lagaataar ye kol karte hue tum nadaarad bhi rahe, gajab, tum to bitman ho bhai!”jeenyu kii ghatana ne desh ke kai chaatrasanghon or shikshak sanghon ko ek kar diya he
 Foremost among these is the Hyderabad Central University, where research student Rohit Vemula committed suicide in January, stating that he was tortured as a Dalit
 hyderabad vishvavidhyalay or jeenyu donon main hi is sangharsh ko ucch varg virdohi sangharsh ke rup main hi dekha ja rahaa he
 The government's response is that the Minister of Human Resource Development has decided that the tricolor will be hoisted at each central university to "fill nationalism"
 desh ko haalanki jo cheez baant rahi he, us par koi bahes nahin ho rahi
 JNU students had actually spoken against the hanging of Afzal Guru on 9 February, which was convicted in the 2001 attack on Parliament
 chaatro ke ek samooh ne guru ke samarthan main naare lagaae
 At the same time slogans were also raised against the autocracy of the Indian state, which implies that he was convicted and hanged wrongly on the basis of circumstantial evidence
 yah faansee 2013 main upie ke raaj main di gai thi
 JNU students believe that in a democracy they have the right to raise this issue, while the opposing view is that any rhetoric in favor of Afzal Guru will be "anti-national" in itself
 bijepi ke kai netaa or naagarik samaaj ke sadsy pichley hafte aisi hi baaten kah chuke hai, jis par jeenyu ke professor camel mitra chenoy kehete hai, “us din jo kaha gaya vah udaar baat nahin thi or chaatro tathaa shikshakon ne uski ninda bhi kii, lekin chaatro ke khilaaf itani kathor karrwai karne kii koi jarurat nahin thi
 If the unconstitutional statements are so vile, then why no action was taken against Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti when she made her statement against Ramzade and Haramzade (during Delhi elections in 2014)? He was released after an apology
 ”ek sawaal or yahaan asahaj karne vaala he
 If speaking against the hanging of Afzal Guru and 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon is indeed anti-national, then why did the BJP form a government in Jammu and Kashmir with the PDP, which has declared Afzal Guru a martyr on several occasions? The Akali Dal, an ally of the BJP in Punjab, supports Balwant Singh Rajoana, the killer of former Chief Minister Beant Singh, who has been declared a Akal Takht martyr before he was hanged

 The question of who is anti-national and who is not can serve many purposes simultaneously
 bijepi ke bhitari logon kaa maananaa he ki 2015 main bihar or dilli main chunavi haar kaa saamana kar chuki party ko iske naam par dhruvikaran kaa ek nayaa mudda mil chukaa he
 For some time, there were also signs of looking for such an issue, especially because the two boats of the Modi government which came to power on board a better economy and good governance have got entangled in the legislative hold
 bharat ke aarthik vikaas ke aankade haalanki ab bhi achche hai, lekin krishi kshetra main susti, nivesh main kami or badhati berogari hataasha ke liye rasta bana rahi he
 The new government has failed to fulfill its promise of "minimum government, maximum good governance"
 vinievesh kii vibhinn pariyojnaayen ab bhi ataki padi hai or duniya main kaarobaar karne kii sahajata ke maamle main desh bahut dhire-dhire tarakkee kar rahaa he
 If there is any sign of development or good days, then one of the reasons for this is that such goals are for the long haul
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ke ranneetikaar lambey samay se ek aise mudde kii firaaq main the jiske irdagird party ke aadhaar or samarthan ko jutaaye rakhaa ja sake
 Issues such as "love jihad", "ghar wapsi" and ban on beef, which had been continuously illuminated during the last 18 months by the torch of Hindutva, did not gain the support as the party had hoped
 party ram mandir ko lekar bhi anishchay kii sthiti main he, jise philhal to thande baste main daal diya gaya he or ho saktaa he ki agle saal uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan usamen dobaaraa jaan phoonk di jaae
 Due to lack of issues, the debate of nationalism is being welcomed with open arms

 If you are anti-national, it would naturally mean that you are pro-pakistan and also anti-military - anyone can run for such cheap rationality
 bijepi ke ek aalaa netaa, jo aresas ke swayamsevak bhi rah chuke hai, kehete hai ki party ko ummid he ki rashtrawaad kii is bahes ko itnaa tej kar diya jaae ki uske sahare logon kii raay kaayam karke assam or bengal main vot jutaaye ja saken

Is democracy not a place where one has the freedom to question the state? They say, "that means you are telling me that in a free country you are not really free

 The Goods and Services Tax will have a very bad effect on the oil and gas industry, as the sector will have to follow both the current tax system and the GST framework
 ek report main yah baat kahi gai he
 The government is going to implement GST regime from July 1, 2017 which will replace 16 different taxes

 ikraa-asocham ne ek sanyukt report main kaha, 'oil evam gas udyog ko vartmaan kar vyavastha or jiesti donon kaa anupaalan karnaa hoga, jisase us par dohari anupaalan laagat aegi
 The reason is that five petroleum products - crude oil, natural gas, motor spirits, high capacity diesel and aviation turbine fuel have been exempted from GST, while LPG, naphtha, kerosene, fuel oil etc
 have been included in GST '
 tippaniyan The report states that the industry will not get the benefit of tax credit

 (input bhashaa se) Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee is going to hold a mega rally in Kolkata on 19 January
 is raily ke liye sabhi vipakshi partiyon ko nyotaa bheja gaya he
 It is believed that this rally will be the biggest gathering of opposition parties because Mamta Banerjee herself has told that there is hardly any opposition leader of the country who has not been invited
 bakaul mamata banerjee, 'raily main kai netaa jaise ki sharad yadav, diemke se stallin, neshnal conference ke faruk abdulla, sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav, argedy ke tejasvi yadav, telugudesham ke en
 Chandrababu Naidu, aap's Arvind Kejriwal, Janata Dal s to HD Kumaraswamy, Congress's Mallikarjun Kharge
 yah bijepi ke khilaaf ladaai kaa ek ahm morcha hoga
 'mamta Banerjee's enumerated names are missing three major names
 ye naam hai sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi or mayawati
 With the arrival of Mallikarjun Kharge, it is clear that Sonia and Rahul will not participate in the rally
 saath hi mayawati bhi raily main shaamil nahin hongi
 Both are Kshatrapamayavati and Mamta Banerjee of their respective regions
 in donon kaa apane-apane pradesh main acha khaasaa janaadhar he
 Although Mayawati's graph has gone down in the last few elections but she has a good hold on the Dalit vote
 mayawati kii khaasiyat yah bhi rahi he ki vah aisi reliyon main janaa pasand nahin karatin jahaan ke centre main vah na hon
 Mayawati is not soon seen sharing the stage with anyone because her politics has been 'ekakshatra'
 agar vah manch saajha bhi karti hai to vahaan vah haaavee hoti hai
 If Mamata Banerjee became the CM of West Bengal for the second time, then Mayawati has been the CM of UP 4 times
 raajnneetik samikshakon kaa maananaa he ki mamata kii raily main na jane kaa ek kaaran yah bhi ho saktaa he ki bispi kaa cader vahaan par majubat nahin he
 From there, neither the party has any MLA nor any MP
 mayawati kaa piem daavedaari main naam pehle bhi uchhal chukaa he, isliye kai myanon main ve mamata banerjee se baari dikhti hai
 In this context, Mayawati's departure on Mamta Banerjee's platform does not fit into the political equation
 achaanak centre main aa gai hai mayawatirajasthan or madhya pradesh ke chunaavon main bispi vidhayakon kaa chunaa janaa or samaajawaadee party se gathbandhan ne mayawati ko achaanak centre main laa diya he
 One reason for this is that the SP chief is giving more importance to Mayawati
 sapa-basapa ke gathjod main ek baat yah nikal kar saamne ai ki 'upi hameshaa se pradhanmantri detaa rahaa he', isliye is baar bhi de saktaa he
 This means that the SP-BSP alliance in UP, the most important state of the country, has decided its PM candidate and the name is Mayawati
 mamata banerjee ko pashchim bengal me vah tavajjo hasil kerani he jo mayawati hasil kar chuki hai
 Because Mamata's alliance has not been done with Congress yet
 congress mamata kii party ol india trinmul congress ke saath jaaegi yaa sipiem ke saath yah abhi tak tay nahin ho paaya he
 The indication of what is not the Congress in the coalition, if the mayawati-akhilesh duo deemed the Congress to be not included in the SP-BSP alliance, the gesture is clear
 diemke netaa stallin kii baat yaad karen to vipaksh ke ek dhade ne rahul gandhi ko piem ummidavaar maan liya he
 In such a situation, what is the rationale for including a party which has already proved its claim? mamata kii raily vipaksh kii raily he isliye manch par gandhi parivaar kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main ek baar phir mahagathbandhan ke piem chehre par sawaal uthanaa lajimi he
 On the other hand, Mamta Banerjee has already said that who will become the PM will be decided after the Lok Sabha elections
 trinmul adhyaksh ek tarah se bataa chuki hai ki abhi na to rahul gandhi par koi baat hogi or na kisi anya netaa ke naam par
 So Sonia, Rahul and Mayawati seem to be more suitable to stay away from Mamta's rally

 bharat ke liye khushi kii baat he ki payalat abhinandan aaj sakushal swadesh laut aaenge
 Pakistan tried to negotiate, however, Pakistan had fiercely indicated bargaining before announcing the release of Wing Commander Abhinandan

 India raised the issue of pilot with us
 kuch dinon main ham faisla karenge ki koun si sandhi us par lagu hogi or bhartiya poilat ko yudhbandi darja diya jaae yaa nahin

e
 tensions decrease then Pakistan is also ready to return the pilot

 After this, Pakistan also tried the airstrike, but the Indian Air Force chased down the planes of Pakistan and killed an aircraft
 is dauraan hamaara mig-21 bhi durghatnagrast ho gaya or wing commander abhinandan pakistan adhikrut kashmir main surakshit utar gaye
 After this, the Pakistan Army took him captive

 input: IANS People have started criticizing yoga guru Baba Ramdev for taking a picture viral on social media
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki swadeshi saamaan ke istemaal par jor dene vaale baba ramdev ne khud apane ghutane kaa oparation germany main karavaaya he
 The viral photo appears to be of a hospital where some people standing near Baba Ramdev are seen drinking something from a glass
 photo se jude capshan main likhaa he-'karo yoga, raho nirog' yoga guru ramdev ke ghutanon kaa germany main safal oparation! 'tum swadeshi apanaao' ye aadmi hi kahata tha naa


 mutr pine or gobar khaane se falaan rog thik hota he dhimka rog thik hota he? 


 khud khaataa nahin dusron ko khilaataa he
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim being made with the photo is false
 ye tasviir june 2011 kii he jab baba ramdev bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anshan par baithe the or unki tabiyat bighad gai thi
 After searching, it was found that this misleading post has been going viral on social media for many days
 photo ko rirvas search karne par hamen june 2011 main chhapisthhe Hindu Business lineki ek khabar mili jisamen is tasviir kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 According to the news, Baba Ramdev went on a nine-day hunger strike demanding strict anti-corruption legislation from the central government
 baba ramdev ne ye anshan chaar june ko haridwar ke ek ashram main shuru kiya tha
 Nine days after the fast, Baba Ramdev's health started deteriorating after which he was admitted to Dehradun Hospital
 is dauraan shri shri ravishankar or morari baapu ne pani pilaakar baba ramdev kaa anshan tudvaya tha
 This picture is also from the same time
 is bare main hamaari baat baba ramdev ke pravaktaa esake tijarawala se bhi hui
 He said that this post is being spread on social media for a long time, which is a lie
 is maamle main unhone kuch dinon pehle ek twit bhi kiya tha

 com / xauout9jdg— Tijarawala SK (@tijarawala)april 18, 2019isi tarah kaa ek post 2018 main bhi jamkar viral hua tha, jisamen daawa tha ki baba ramdev ne apane ghutane kaa oparation germany main karavaaya he
 At that time many media houses had denied this news
 uttar pradesh main sarkaar badalane ke saath hi mahotsavon kaa rang bhi badalane laga he
 In the previous government, where the Saifai festival was in the shadow, Gorakhpur festival was discussed in the Yogi government
 ab 18 farvari se agra main shuru hone vaala taj mahotsav surkhiyon main he
 Moving ahead on the agenda of Hindutva, the Yogi government is preparing to paint the Taj Mahotsav, which is seen in Mughalia color, this time in saffron
 vaah taj nahin, jayshriramdrasal taj mahotsav main jo kaarykram rakhe gaye hai, uske mutabik is baar taj mahotsav ke aagaaj main manch par bhagwaan ram kii chhavi dikhaai jaaegi
 Tretayug will be shown through Ramlila
 abhi tak desh or duniya bhar se aane vaale log jab tajmahal kaa didaar karte hai to unki jubaan se bas do shabd nikalataa he, vaah taj
 But two weeks later on February 18, Jai Shri Ram will emerge from the mouths of those who will be present here, not the crown
 ji haa, 18 farvari ko upi kaa mashhoor taj mahotsav shuru ho rahaa he
 For the first time, the image of God will be seen in the Taj Mahotsav as the festival will be inaugurated by the presentation of Shri Ram Indian Art Center, in which all the forms of Lord Ram will be seen on the stage of Muktakashika
 pehali baar mughalkaal nahin, tretayug dikhegrab tak ke taj mahotsavon main mughalkaal kii jhalak najar aati thi, lekin is baar dharohar theme par yojit is mahotsav main pehali baryogi sarkaaraki chhap najar aegi
 UP Governor and Chief Minister Yogi have also been invited for the festival
 har baar kii tarah is baar yahaan bollywood ke sitare shirkat karenge
 Foreign artists will also perform on stage
 haakim ko khush karne main jute afsamb soobe ke haakim badale hai to afasar bhi unhen khush karne main koi kasar nahin chhodana chaah rahe hai
 That is why the name of Ram will be echoed this time in the Taj festival, which tells about Mughalia shano-shaukat
 upi ke siem yogi adityanath kii rambhakti kisi se chhipi nahin he
 Since becoming CM, he has visited Ayodhya many times
 diwali par unhone bhavy ram puja kaa bhi aayojan kiya tha
 In such a situation, the big question is whether the imprint of Lord Ram on the Taj Mahotsav is an extension of that agenda of the Yogi government, under which the government buildings in UP are being painted in saffron
 kahaan tak asar karegi jayshriram kii gunjasoobe kii sarkaar badalte hi sarkari imaaraton ke baad skulon tak kaa rang badla jane laga
 The extent was reached when the color of Haj House in Lucknow was also saffron
 haalanki baad main sarkaar ne kuch logon par gaaj giraate hue is puure prakaran se haath khinch liya tha
 But now the time will tell how far Jashree Ram's echo will affect the Taj festival
 philhal agra kaa prashasan taj mahotsav kaa bhagavakaran karne kii taiyaariyon main puure ji-jaan se juta hua he
 According to the Festival Festival Organizing Committee, the festival will begin with the staging of a drama drama based on Lord Shri Ram on behalf of Shri Ram Bharati Arts Center on February 18
 19 farvari ko lok gayika malini avasthi kaa program hoga
 Bollywood Night on 20 and Qawwali singer Aslam Sabri on 21
 22 farvari ko pune kaa blike and white group puraane geeton par aadhaarit program pesh karegaa, vahiin 23 farvari ko mushayara or 24 farvari ko kavi sammelan hoga
 Bollywood actors have been invited to the program from 25 to 27 February
 masaba ne kaha, "hamane rangon ke saath prayog karne kaa faisla kiya
 White sindoor is the fashion statement, while hot pink is slightly different from traditional sindoor
 hot pink aadhunik bhartiya mahila kaa pratinidhitiv bhi karata he
 
 
 If someone wants to plant sindoor in a different and interesting way, this is a better way to do it
 "A post shared by Mufasa(@masabagupta) on Apr 4, 2018 at 10:41pm PDT Widely admired in India, the Pakistani singer was trained under Bade Ghulam Ali Khan in Hindustani music
 Known as the 'ghazal king', Ghulam Ali has enthralled music lovers on both sides of the border with his melodious voice
 The Jamaat-ud Dawa, a terrorist organization of the most wanted terrorist Hafiz Saeed of the Mumbai attack, has changed his name
 jamaat ud daawa kaa naam badalane kaa ye faisla hafiz said kii najarbandi ke kareeb hafte bhar baad hua he
 The name of the organization has been changed to tehreek-e-azadi Jammu and Kashmir (TAJK)
 saidane apni najarbandi se kareeb ek hafte pehle sanket die the ki vah kashmir kii aazaadee kii muhim tej karne ke liye taharik aazaadee jammu-kashmir shuru kar saktaa he
 This shows that Saeed was aware of the government's plan and had already decided how to come back after taking action on Jamaat ud Dawa (JUD) and Falah e Insaniyat Foundation (FIF) and how the organization Have to maintain
 aadhikarik sutron ne pushti kii ki tiageke ke nae naam ke tahat do sanghathanon ne gatividhiyaan shuru kar di hai or ve paanch farvari ko kaaryakramon ke aayojan kii yojana bana rahe hai jise pakistan menkashmir divasake rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Banners of TAJK were displayed in Lahore on Kashmir in Lahore and other cities and towns
 samooh shaam kii namaaj ke baad lahore main kashmir par ek sammelan yojit karne kii bhi yojana bana rahaa he
 TAJK has resumed donation centers and ambulance service in various districts of Punjab including Lahore
 lahore is samooh kii gatividhiyon kaa centre he
 Leader of Opposition in Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly Ajay Singh said on Thursday that women are becoming victims of life in the state, but state Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan is engaged in robbing women vote banks
 netaa pratipaksh singh ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki rajya main har roj mahilaon va bacchiyon kii izzat luti ja rahi he or police peediton kii baat tak sunne ko taiyaar nahin he
 In Gwalior, the police even demanded proof of rape from a victim and in the end the victim woman thought it better to die
 unhone kaha ki gwalior main peedit mahila dwaara aatmahatya karnaa pehla maamla nahin he
 On February 7, a Dalit girl committed suicide in that district after the Chief Minister won the assembly elections from Sehore district because the police did not take action against the accused despite the report
 isi tarah kaa maamla loksabhaa main netaa pratipaksh sushamaa swaraj ke sansadeey kshetra vidisha kaa maamla he, jahaan chhedchhad se tang aakar ek naaballig ko aatmahatya karnaa padi
 In Rajgarh district, even after two months of writing the report, the married woman committed suicide
 baitool main bhi is tarah kii ghatana hone par rashtriya mahila ayog ne police ko doshi bataaya he
 In Indore, the report of a rape victim was written on the instructions of the Inspector General of Police
 shivpuri main chaar bahanon ne chaar baar police adheekshak se shikaayat kii he ki un par jismfaroshi ke liye dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he, lekin police ne koi karrwai nahin kii
 The Leader of Opposition further said that atrocities on women and non-action by the police on their grievances exposed the reality of the government's claims of being female friendly
 unhone kaha ki in halaat main mukhyamantri chouhan kii mahilaon ke vot bank luutane kii jugat kaamyaab hone vaali nahin he

 National selection committee chairman Krishnamachari Srikkanth has admitted that the Indian cricket team was not fully prepared for the tour of England but said that it would not be right to blame the selectors for the defeat
 bhartiya team ko england daure main ab tak pehali jeet kii talash he
 After losing 0-4 in the Test series, they had to face defeat in the Twenty20 and also in the second ODI on Tuesday
 shrikant ne kaha, ‘aap yah kah sakate ho ki ham puri tarah se taiyaar nahin the
 Some players arrived directly from the West Indies
 england kii paristhitiyaan thodi bhinn hai lekin isisi apatpi (bhavishya kaa daura kaarykram) kaaphi pehle tay ho gaya tha tathaa yahaan tak ki bisisiai bhi isko lekar kuch nahin kar saktaa tha
 India also lost their number one Test ranking in the tour but Srikanth is against criticizing its players and blaming the selectors for losing
 unhone kaha, ‘jab chijen galat ho jaati hai to phir dosha madhne kaa koi matlab nahin banataa
 It was the only series in which nothing suited us
 aap chayankartaaon ko is haar kaa dosha kyon de rahe ho
 'srikanth said,' India has been the number one team for 20 months
 hamane newjiland, dakshin africa or westeindies ko uski sarajameen par haraaya or chaar saale pehle england ko bhi uski dharti par haraaya tha lekin is baar kuch bhi hamaare anukool nahin rahaa
 Srikanth admitted that young batsman Suresh Raina had trouble playing short pitch balls but refused to believe that India's 'bench strength' was weak
 is purv bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘raina ko visheshkar test maichon main short pich gendon ke saamne apni takanic main sudhaar karnaa hoga
 But i do not agree that our bench strength is weak
 yah prakriya he
 The young players who got a chance in the last few years have done well
 ’shrikant ne jahir khan or virendra sahvaag jaise chotil khilaadiyon kaa chayan karne kaa bhi bachaav kiya
 He said, 'sehwag and Zaheer were needed of the team
 in khilaadiyon ko bhi laga ki ve koshish kar sakate hai
 He said, 'as far as Sehwag is concerned, we should accept that he tried his best but he felt that he was not fully fit
 aap vahi karte ho jo visheshgy aapse kehete hai lekin vahaan pahunchane ke baad use laga ki vah nahin chal paayegaa
 The country needed him
 usne asal main desh ko upar rakhaa
 He felt that the country needed his services
 ’shrikant ko phir se is pad par barkaraar rakhe jane kii sambhaavna he lekin unhone is par kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 He said, 'this is an issue between me and the board
 chayan kii tarah is tarah ke masalon par bhi saarvajanik charchaa nahin kii jaati he
 It will be the decision of the board but we should come to know in a few days

 lekin is bich rajkot ke cricket maidan main duusare tii-20 mukaable main sabase zyada utaar-chadhaav dekha gaya, or aakhir main team india kii 40 ranon se haar hui
 The defeat was decided only when Virat Kohli was dropped
 haalanki viraat kohli ke out hone ke baad mahendra singh dhoni ne team india ko jitaane ke liye puri koshish kii
 But in the wake of taking a long shot, he lost his wicket
 
 
 
 So the Dugunarajkot T20 match would have been a birthday celebration, even though the match was not decisive, even though New Zealand have equaled 1–1 in the series by winning this match
 lekin agar team india ye match jeet jaati to captain viraat kohli ko team kii ore se ye sabase bada berthde gift hota
 Because on 5 November, captain Virat Kohli has his birthday and this victory would have doubled the birthday celebration, as well as India's possession of the T20 series
 ab teesraa or aakhri match nirnaayak hoga
 Team India lost by 40 runs In this match, New Zealand won the toss and decided to bat first and gave Team India a target of 197 runs in the scheduled 20 overs
 lakshya kaa peechha karne utari team india ko shuruaati 2 jatke lage, uske baad phir 65 ran ke score par teesraa wicket gir gaya
 By this time India was in competition
 aakhri dam tak khud ladate rahe kohlitisraa wicket girane ke khud captaini kohli ballebaaji karne aae or team ko shuruaati dabaav se baahar nikaala
 At one time it seemed that Kohli himself would snatch the match from New Zealand and put it in India's bag
 lekin ek choti si galati se unka wicket newjiland ko haath lag gaya or match kaa rukh badal gaya
 Kohli was dismissed for 65 runs in 42 balls
 dhoni kii koshish bhi naakamek tarah se kohli kaa wicket girnaa hi match ko terning point sabit hua or team india match haar gai
 Because at the time Kohli was out, India scored 16
 3 overon main 123 ran tha or duusare chor par dhoni kohli kaa saath de rahe the
 Perhaps Dhoni also wanted to gift this victory to his captain on his birthday
 lekin kohli ke out hote hi jeet haar main badal gai
 After waiting for the third match, Akshar Patel came to bat
 lekin jab tak wo apane balle se kamaal dikhaate kaaphi der ho chuki thi, or phir dhoni ne match main vaapasi ke liye kuch lambey shot jarur lagaae
 But on a personal score of 49 runs, he also returned his pavilion after holding his catch
 is tarah team india apane captain ko berthde par 'jeet' tohfe main dene se chook gai
 The batsman is responsible for the defeat, however, Virat Kohli has attributed the batting of the team to this defeat
 captain ne kaha, 'balle se ham acha pradarshan nahin kar sake
 When you are chasing 200 runs, all your batsmen have to score or one batsman has to score at a strike rate of 200, i tried my best
 dhoni ne aakhir main acha khel dikhaaya, lekin hamaara kaam kaaphi mushkil tha
 ' bhartiya team ek vanade mukaable main captain mahendra singh dhoni ke homeground ranchi main siries chauthaa match kheli ho saktaa he ye unka apane maidan par aakhri match ho
 Actually there is no ODI match in Ranchi till June next year
 haalanki abhi dhoni kaa sanyas lene kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 Why is the fourth match of the series Team India wins this match, then the series will be captured
 beete do saalon se dhoni vanade siries jeet ke liye taras rahe he
 Dhoni's army has lost the series three times in two years
 JSCA ground team india ke liye abtak lucky sabit hua he
 India has not lost any match here
 film relies ke baad pehali baar ranchi main khel rahe handhoni par bani film kii adhiktar shooting ranchi or uske aasapaas ke ilaakon main hui he
 Through this biopic of Dhoni, people also saw the inadvertent aspects related to the life of the prince of his favorite Ranchi
 super hit sabit hue is film ke relies ke baad dhoni pehali baar ranchi main khel rahe he
 People are hopeful that this time Dhoni will again come down to number four and show his batting glory

 Replying to the discussion on the Bill, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal said that it is a settled bill and it has been brought into consideration from all aspects
 unhone kaha ki bajet satr ko vipakshi dalon ne chalane nahin diya jis vajah se us samay yah vidheyak nahin laayaa ja sakaa
 Victim Piyush Goyal said that the purpose of bringing the ordinance was to send a message that the government is strict and black money is being attacked
 unhone kaha ki is kanoon main yah praavdhaan kiya gaya he kiarthik aparadhakarne vaale bhagodon kii desh ke bheetar or baahar sabhi benami sampattiyaan jabt kii jaaengi
 Goyal dismissed the concern of some members that due to the provisions of the law, innocent people can also come to the action
 vitt mantri goyal ne kaha ki yah kanoon bhagodon ke liye he or agar koi vyakti nirdosh he to use bhaagane kii kya zarurat he or use to khud ko kanoon ke hawaale karnaa chahie
 The Bill provides for measures to protect the sanctity of the rule of law in India, to prevent fugitive economic offenders from escaping the process of law in India while remaining outside the jurisdiction of Indian courts

 It provides for attachment of property of fugitive economic offender
 isamen kaha gaya he ki kisi bhi bhagode aarthik apradhi ko koi civil daawa karne yaa bachaav karne kii hakdaari nahin hogi
 In such cases it is said to appeal to the High Court against the orders issued by the special courts

 In the meantime, Majhi denied the kind of news coming in the media about the seat sharing and said that no formula has been decided yet, how will the seats be decided? Manjhi said, "if we fight together, we will definitely defeat the NDA but if we fight separately, the NDA will not lose and it will be a big loss for the country
" VIDEO: NDA se alag hue jithan ram maanjhi Former Indian batsman Rahul Dravid, who is called the wall of the Indian cricket team, has instructed the current captain of Team India, Virat Kohli that only the tattooed players do not contribute in the team's victory
 team us khilaadi ke dam par bhi match jitati he, jiske sharir par tatu nahin hote
 It is not necessary for the player to look like a macho man
 rahul dravid ne ek sahitya mahotsav ke dauraan kaha ‘viraat kabhi-kabhi zyada aakraamak ho jate hai
 Before reading the series against New Zealand, i saw aggression in him
 lekin agar vah vipakshi team ke khilaaf behatar pradarshan kar sakate hai to ve aisa kar sakate hai
 i often read such statements before any series
 ’rahul dravid ne haalanki yah kehete hueviraat kohlika bachaav bhi kiya ki ‘main kabhi tatu vaale viraat jaisaa nahin ho saktaa
 i can never get my hands tattooed like that
 ’ is dauraan unase kumble or viraat vivaad ke bare main bhi poocha gaya is par dravid ne badi hi chaturaai se jawaab de diya
 Rahul Dravid said, Kumble had to resign as coach, it was very unfortunate
 saarvajanik taur par yah sari chijen baahar nahin aani chahie thim
 Kumble is still a legend
 kumble ke saath jo hua vah asammanjanak tha
 Dravid said that whatever happened to Kumble was not right
 sachai kya he or dressing room main kya hua main us par tippanee nahin karnaa chahta
 But it would definitely be said that whatever happened to the bad luck and especially with a person like Anil
 dravid ne kaha ki aaj ke daure main coach or captain ke bich vivaad aam baad ho gai he
 Sometimes it is seen that they disagree with each other
 mere saath bhi aisa ho saktaa he main bhi under-19 ko coach hum
 At the same time, about the retirement of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, he said that if the selectors choose him, then he can play as long as he wants

 Similarly i have handled things in my 11 year career
 main hameshaa apni chuppi kii parchhaayi main sachai ko khadaa dekhati hum
 He also tells lies so many times that he too finally seems to be true and i am afraid of what is happening to me
 meri chuppi kii vajah se hi mere liye bole gaye jhooth sach main badalane lage hai, lekin aaj iskaa ant hoga
 i have always kept quiet
 main us vakt bhi chup rahi jab mere pati viraat kohli ke pradarshan ke liye mujhe jimmedaar tehraaya gaya
 Apart from this, my name was also included for many things related to cricket
 meraa naam un kisson main bhi liya gaya, ki main band kamaron main hone vaali cricket team kii baithkon main shaamil hoti or team kaa sillection mere vajah se prabhavit hota he
 "in her post, Anushka Sharma further wrote, My name was used incorrectly even when i was told that i spend more time with my husband on a foreign tour
 lekin agar tathyon par dhyaan den to maine hameshaa se saare protocol follow kiye hai
 It was also said that the board arranges tickets and security for me, while the truth is that i buy the tickets for the matches and flights myself
 ab in sabamein jo sabase nayaa jhooth failaayaa ja rahaa he wo yah he ki mujhe silectors ne world cap 2019 main chaay parosi thi
 i came to the World Cup in a game and sat in the family box, not with the selectors
 agar aapako apane silectors par or unki yogyataon par sawaal uthaanaa he to shauk se uthaaiye, lekin isamen meraa naam mat ghasitiye
 But, i will not let anyone bring my name to these things
 anoushka sharma (anushka Sharma) ne kaha, "aisa nahin he ki mujhe keval is news se pareshaani hui he or maine apni chuppi todi he
 Every time i feel so bad
 isaliye mere is letters ko news kaa jawaab na samajhen
 i decided to speak today, because someone's silence should never be understood as weakness
 aapako apana agenda chalaanaa he, kisi kii aalochana kerani ho, bhale hi mere pati kii aalochana kyon na kerani ho, wo aap tathyon or sabooton ke saath karen
 But spare me
 maine apane dampar apana kariyar banaaya he or main is cheez ke liye kisi se samjhauta nahin karuungi

 chunaavon kii aahat ke saath hi upi main 'aayaa ram-gaya ram' kaa khel shuru ho gaya he
 In this game, the BJP is currently visible to the new shelter of leaders of various other parties
 jabaki ghate kii baat karen to sabase adhik nuksaan bispi kaa hua he
 Two of the bsp's big names, Swami Prasad Maurya and Brajesh Pathak, are now in the BJP camp
 haalanki mayawati inhen rejected maal bataa chuki hai
 BJP has so far had 10 sitting and former mlas from other parties
 jabaki 20 or vidhayakon kii list party ke paas he
 There was a preparation to join them together
 lekin party cader kaa baagi mood bhaanpate hi iraadaa badla gaya or abadhire-dhire inhen party jwoin karavaaya jayega
 Sensing the same mood, state president Keshav Prasad Maurya recently said that more than 30 people will not be given tickets among the leaders coming from outside
 lekin jitani munh utani baaten
 It is common discussion within the party that now two big Mauryas and two Pathak leaders have become leaders in the party, in such a situation if the clones of all the big leaders will be seen here
 puraane kaaryakartaaon ke saath anyaay nahiparty ke bheetar machi khalabali par pradesh pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak kehete hai, 'puraane kaaryakarta ke saath netritv koi anyaay nahin hone degaa, lekin ham nae le rahe hai to kya nae logon kii sambhanana khatm kar degen
 There are also infinite possibilities among those we are taking
 hamaare kuch kaaryakarta jo constitution vishesh par kaam kar rahe hai, unamem bhi aseem sambhaavnaae hai
 While contouring the possibilities of both, justice should be done with everyone, we will consider this
 'do pathak or do maury ke jabaab main pathak ne kaha ki abhi bhi tamaam aisi sambhaavnaae hai
 Whatever is to come
 party main unka swaagat he
 Together they will complete the target of 265 plus
 pathak ne aage kaha, 'koi asantusht nahin he
 We are all working together and together we will complete that work
 maine phir kaha jo log aa rahe hai unamem bhi sambhaavnaae talaashenge
 The ticket is for those who want to fight against them, but there is an uneasiness about the newly imported leaders within the BJP which is not openly visible
 kai jilon main ab ye jwalamukhi kii tarah ubal rahaa he
 The workers feel that they were there to fight on the streets for 5 years, whereas now when the turn of the ticket comes, it is going to the hands of the leaders with whom they have been fighting
 haalanki ye jwalamukhi abhi shant he, kyonki party ne abhi tikat tay nahin kiye hai
 Boiling in Barabanki and warning of resignation Barabanki is also boiling in BJP due to neglect of old workers after joining BJP from other parties
 barabanki main party ke sakriy sadsy or party kii jila kaaryakarini ke purv mahaamantri pankaj nigam kehete hai, 'baahar se jo log aae unakon kam se kam paanch saal party kii seva bina kisi laalach ke kerani chahie
 The party will be strengthened by the arrival of Swami Prasad Maurya and Brijesh Pathak
 lekin inako tikat yaa koi bada pad party ko nahin dena chahie
 If this happens, we will resign collectively

 He said, 'which woman would want some soutan to come to her house
 lekin agar pati ghar va parivaar ko badhaane ke liye sautan le bhi aata he to use sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 "we are not like Azam and Amar", he said, referring to Amar Singh and Azam Khan as soutanas, saying that the soutanas coming to our party are much better than the sons of Samajwadi Party
 wo sapa ke amar singh or ajam khan kii tarah ek-duusare ko gaali nahin deteen
 In the BJP, everyone has to live within the scope of the rule of law
 bijepi ke puraane netaaon kaa tikat katkar duusare dalon se aae netaaon ko tikat dene ke bare main unhone kaha ki yah bahut bura lagata he
 Regarding Swami Prasad Morya, Shashibala Pundir said that he will have to follow the party's policies after joining BJP
 jaise vah bispi main oonchi jaati ke logon ke saath vyavhaar karte the, agar unhone aisa vyavhaar bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon ke saath kiya to vah bardaasht nahin hoga or unka virodh kiya jayega
 That is, if the gesture is to become friends, then Soutan will have to adopt policy and rules

 saharanpur kii raajnneeti main shashibala pundir ko ek dabang netaa ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The response of Outer vs
 Inner is not getting as much response Swami Prasad Maurya should get from BJP workers due to external vs
 inner
 pichley hafte meerut main ek hi din swami prasad maury or kendriya mantri rajyavardhan singh rathore the
 But in both the programs of the BJP, there was a huge crowd, while the seats remained empty in the program of Swami Prasad Maurya
 meerut main maury ke kaarykram se nadaarad rahe netabahujan samaaj party ko chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hue swami prasad maury pichley dinon jab meerut pahunche to tay samay ke mukaable ghanton der ho chuki thi
 So, most of the people listening to Maurya had gone to the rally venue
 kursiyaan khaali padi thim or bijepi ke sthaneey netaa bhi sabha se nadaarad najar aae
 The biggest thing in Meerut was seen that the BJP leaders of Meerut Mandal kept away from the program
 pehle din se hi meerut main soochna evam prasaaran kendriya rajya mantri rajyavardhan rathore maujuud the
 In two days, the program in Meerut of two leaders and both did not know each other
 yahaan tak ki swami se milane tak ke liye bijepi ke netaa nahin pahunche
 Although the BJP may be excited that the people in his party have lined up outside the party office, but the threat to the BJP like Bihar is seen here that if the number of ticket contenders is enough, then The list of those who defeated him will also become longer

 com / 0msfjfcj8r— ICC (@icc)november 1, 2017 The Supreme Court has refused to change the date of April 18 scheduled for Lok Sabha elections in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry
 is sambandh main desh kii sarvocch adaalat main yachika daakhil kii gai thi
 The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to hear this petition
 isaayiyon ke ek sanghathan ne apni yachika tatkaal soochibaddh karne kaa nyaayalay se anurodh kiya tha
 In the petition, requesting change of voting date in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on 18 April, it was said that this election date should be changed as it is falling between Good Friday and Easter
 yachikakarta ke vakil ne peeth se apana paksh rakhte hue kaha ki matdaan kii tithi good friday or easter ke bich main he, isliye iske liye nai taarikh tay kii jaae
 On this, the Supreme Court Justice SA Bobde asked the counsel for the petitioner that you cannot vote on any holy day? And 'we don't want to advise you how to pray and vote
 ' yah kehete hue court ne yachika par sunwaayee karne se inkaar kar diya
 This is not the first request to change the voting date due to the festival
 kai raajnneetik dalon ne ramajaan maheene ke dauraan loksabhaa chunaav kii tithiyon par aapatti jataai thi, raajnneetik dalon kaa daawa tha ki ramajaan maheene ke chalate muslim kam sankhya main vot karne jaaenge or iskaa phayda bhaajapa ko milegaa
 Owaisi said that this whole controversy was said to be unnecessary because Good Friday is a special day for the community of Good Friday
 prabhu yishu kaa balidaan diwas 'good friday' is baar 30 march ko he
 It is a major festival of the Christian community
 kaha jaataa he ki aaj ke din hi prabhu isa messiah ne apane bhakton ke liye balidaan dekar niyaswaarth prem kaa sarvocch udhaaharan diya tha
 Lord Jesus had crucified and given a message of love and forgiveness
 is din ko holi friday, blike friday yaa great friday bhi kehete hai
 It is said that Lord Jesus had already realized this
 isliye good friday ke 40 din pehle hi jisas ne vrath shuru kar diya tha
 It is celebrated as Good Friday on Friday, three days before the resurrection of Christ
 is din bhaktagan upwas ke saath prarthana or manan karte hai
 During this time, the devotees remember the suffering suffered by Lord Jesus on the cross for three hours
 raat ke samay kahin-kahin kaale vastra pahanakar shraddhalu yishu kii chhavi lekar matam manaate hue ek samaaroh nikaalte hai or pratikatmak taur par unka antim sanskaar bhi kiya jaataa he
 Since Good Friday is a day of atonement and prayer
 isliye is din girjagharon main ghantiyaan nahin bajaai jaatin
 This time Punjab is going to be in a tussle with political parties as the Election Commission has given them the shortest time to campaign so far
 30 janvari ko 1,74,33,408 matadaata vibhinn partiyon ke ummidavaaron kii kismat voting mashiinon main band karne vaale hai
 Punjab's election is considered to be extremely important even among the Mahasangram of Uttar Pradesh
 punjab ke sabase lambey samay tak sakriy rahane vaale or chaar baar rajya ke mukhyamantri rahe 84 varshiya prakaash singh badal ghoshnaa kar chuke hai ki yah unka antim chunavi yuddh hoga
 But the decision of the public will decide whether his only son and political successor, Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, will be able to handle his father's legacy

 But his 49-year-old cousin Manpreet Singh Badal is doing the spoilage for the Deputy Chief Minister
 sukhbir or prakaash singh badal se matbhedon ke kaaran aktubar, 2010 main unhone rajya ke vitt mantri ke pad se istipha dene ke baad akali dal se rishta tod diya tha
 The main reason for this difference is believed to be the succession fight
 phir march main manpreet ne pipuls party of punjab naam se apni party banaai
 It is believed that this new party can spoil the game of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in the Malwa region of Punjab i

 kitni bhaawanaaon ko khud main samete rakhte hai phool
 Be it the expression of love or love, the first thing to remember is flowers
 beshak iske or bhi rang hai, lekin phulon se judaa sabase gaharaa rang he pyaar kaa
 Even in your mind, the feeling of giving them flowers is going on, but every flower has a different story attached to it
 alag hoti he har phool kii jubaan
 And if you understand that tongue, then know that the untold things of your heart will not need a crutch of words
 bina kahe hi wo samaj jaaengi wo sari baaten
 Know how and which flowers can make your dastan-e-mohabbat taste
 bazaar se yun hi koi phool chun lene se baat nahin banegi
 Rather, it can also make things worse
 har maukey ke liye alag hote hai phool
 And their language is different
 ek hi jaise phool har avasar ke liye sahi nahin hote
 You do not even need to be very knowledgeable to understand this fragrance and need of flowers
 bas jaraa si soch or samaj aapke is kaam ko aasaan bana sakati he
 While choosing flowers, it is very important to know and understand the beauty of opportunity and time
 varanaa yaad rakhie, phulon ke saath kaante bhi hote hai-nai dosti kii shuruampani bhaawanaaon ko jaahir kar paanaa aasaan nahin hota
 Especially when love has a new beginning
 dil main bhaawanaaon kaa jowar-bhaata chal rahaa hota he
 Sometimes in one moment they start touching the sky, and in the second moment, they go out of nowhere
 agar aise maukey par aap apni saathi ko phulon kaa tohfa dena chaahate hai, to gulabi, laal or sunahare rang ke phulon kaa mail sahi rahegaa
 Your bouquet should look vibrant and colorful
 phulon se mahakaayen dostiphul kisi ko aapaki najar main uski ahmiyat bhi darshaate hai
 You can choose garden style flowers for your friend
 aapaki dost ke liye yah behtareen tohfa ho saktaa he
 There is no better gift than flowers to please a woman during romance
 pyaar or phulon kaa gaharaa naata jo he
 The relationship grows stronger with flowers at every stage
 yahaan aapke paas kaaphi vikalp hote hai
 You can give them the flowers that they always want to keep in front of their eyes
 yaa phir un phulon ke bare main kya raay he jo aapaki shaadi ko mahakaa rahe the or jinhen dekhakar unhone aapke kaan main kaha tha, 'dekho kitne khubasurat hai ye phool' or aap bas itnaa hi kah paae the, 'tumse zyada nahin

 No construction related details have been given in respect of the three dams
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki bharat ko is kadam ke bare main ab tak nahin suchit nahin kiya gaya he
 When asked about the plans for the construction of the dams, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Li told reporters, "china has always taken a responsible attitude towards development on rivers across the border
 ’unhone kaha, ‘kisi bhi nayi pariyojna par vaigyanik yojana ke tahat or nadi kii dhara ke nichle evam upree ilaakon ke deshon ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhkar adhyayan kiya jaataa he

 That is, in a way, on the most difficult turn of the election lane, the coalition has made the most sensible and balanced decision, but the real dhobi in this riot of politics is yet to overcome
 kyonki acid test abhi baaki he
 This distribution of seats between the three parties was important in the sense that the real edge of the alliance would be known from here

 His sensitive appeal helped a promising football player Majid Arshid Khan return home
 jab bhi koi kishor hinsa ke raste par utarataa he, to sabase adhik uskaa parivaar prabhavit hota he
 Leaving the path of violence not easy, Mufti said that she understands the mood of those youths who have gone astray on the path of terrorism

 conklev ke pehle din 'flatiopoint: rajdroh: deshbhakti kaa nayaa test kit' seshan main bijepi netaa or fishan diziner agnimitra paul, supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish dow
 Ashok Ganguly, BJP (west Bengal) general secretary Sayantan Basu and Mental Health Activist Ratnaboli Roy put forth their views
 is mahatvapurn seshan main manch kaa sanchaalan india today televijan ke kansalting editor rajdeep saradesai ne kiya
 Former Supreme Court judge Ashok Ganguly, appearing for the debate on the Sedition, said that the sedition law had come to the British Raj
 tilak or gandhi ji ke khilaaf ise chalaaya gaya
 But after independence, it was also used against those who fought for freedom
 is dauraan unhone supreme court ke ek cese kaa hawala bhi diya
 Justice Ganguly said- You cannot just blame BJP, Jastis Ganguly said that the first case in the Supreme Court when the case was discussed was the Ramesh Thapa case
 ek sarchalite newspaper bambe se chalata tha
 It was critical of Nehru's policy
 madras sarkaar ne iskaa prakaashan or cirkulation rajya main band kar diya
 After which the publisher went to the Supreme Court and got justice
 49 log jinhone piem ko chitthee likhi, police ne unke khilaaf cese file kiya
 The court understood that sedition was not required here
 unhone aage kaha ki ramesh thapa cese main supreme court ne grih mantri ko kaha ki aapako is aadesh ko lagu karaane ke liye kuch karnaa chahie
 You cannot just blame the BJP

 On the arrest of Kanhaiya, Justice Gangulyjustis Ganguly further said that the law of Sedition was removed in all civilized democratic nation
 har jagah yah cognijible afence (sangyeya aparaadh) nahin he
 In Britain it has been removed, in the US it is not a cognizable crime
 lekin yahaan yah cognijible afence he
 Kanhaiya Kumar should not have been arrested without a warrant
 justise ashok ganguli ne kaha ki rajya main aap sawaal uthaaie aapke khilaaf ection ho jayega
 It is a people's fight against the state
 Finally, Justice Ashok Ganguly said that Sedition is a state issue

 upi ke gorakhpur se bijepi saansad yogi adityanath kii mushkilen bad sakati hai
 Adityanath, who was already staring in the eyes of the Election Commission due to his inflammatory speeches, has shown another act on Wednesday
 prashasan or ayog ko khuli chunauti dete hue saansad ne buudhvaar ko lakhanu main prashasnic roak ke baavjood raily ko sambodhit kiya
 Taking cognizance of the case, the Election Commission has also demanded a report from the DM of Lucknow within two days
 gauratlab he ki lakhanu ke munshi puliya main buudhvaar shaam bijepi saansad kii raily honi thi
 The district administration did not allow the MP to rally
 aise main roak ke baavjood yogi adityanath shaam ko jansabha ko sambodhit karne pahunch gaye
 During this, he accused the SP government of dictatorship and said that the state government was promoting communal agenda
 adityanath ne kaha ki upi main dhai saal main 450 dange hue or yah sapa sarkaar kii vifaltaa kaa parinaam he
 Yogi Adityanath also slammed the SP government for not getting the permission of the district administration for the rally
 unhone kaha ki ijaajat kaa nahin milanaa raajnneeti se prerit he or yah sab sarkaar ke dabaav main hua he
 He said that the administration has harassed him, while the district administration says that the mp's people themselves withdrew the rally application in Munshi Pulia and hence the rally was not allowed
 lakhanu dm kii ore se bataaya gaya ki ukt sthaan par congress or sapa ko bhi raily kii anumati nahin di gai he
 On the other hand, a few hours after the mp's address, the Election Commission also issued notice to the DM of Lucknow, taking cognizance of the case
 ayog ne roak ke baavjood raily ke aayojan par dm se do dinon ke andar report kii maang kii he
 This is an open challenge: Reacting to the Lucknow rally of Congress Yogi Adityanath, Rita Bahuguna Joshi on behalf of the Congress said that this is a serious matter and is an open challenge directly to the Election Commission

 You must have seen the time machine in science fiction films, through which people travel time
 pregent se future yaa pregent se past main chale jate hai
 Even in the world of science, it is still like fiction
 lekin abhi ek taaja development main aisa hi kuch hua he yaa yon kahen ki isse milti julati koi khoj kii gai he
 Scientists in Russia have given a demonstration of time reversal using quantum computers
 ab ye dhyaan main rakhen ki aisa asal main nahin hua he, yani kisi ne time travel nahin kiya he
 Scientists have performed a demonstration and surprisingly it is against the law of physics
 rus ke moscow uniwarsity of physics and technolji ke vaigyanikon ne switzraland or america researchrs ke saath mil kar ek ‘time mashin’ develop kiya he
 a quantum computer was used to make it
 rus ke vaigyanikon ne daawa kiya he ki aisi time mashin taiyaar kii gai he jo samay ko peeche kar sakati he, lekin sirf fraction of seconds, wo bhi experiment ke taur par
 Not in real life
 aisa kiya gaya he qwontem computer kii madad se
 This alleged time machine cannot be carried in past or future, but it is considered as a big breakthrough for further research

 aapako bataa den ki isi kaa pehla niyam ye kahata he ki energy ne to creat kii ja sakati he or na hi khatm kii ja sakati he, ise sirf transfar kiya ja saktaa he
 These scientists of the MIPT press office have claimed that they have denied this law of physics and put the time behind
 dow
 Gorde Lejvik is the head of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology
 unhone kaha he, ‘hamane artificili ek state taiyaar kiya he jotime ke thermodynemics ero ke vipareet disha main taiyaar hota he’
 He has also said that this series of papers also opposes the second law of thermodynamics
 kya he qwontem computer?saaf shabdon or kam samay main qwontem computer ko jaananaa he to aise samajhen
 In a common computer, all the information or data you say, these are stored in bits
 0 or 1 ke taur par aap aise bhi samaj sakate hai
 Quantum computers do not have bits, but here there are cubits (quantum bits) and they are in the form of 0,1
 aam computer main computing ke liye binery kods jaise 0 yaa 1 ke jariye information ko ripregent kiya jaataa he
 While quantum computing uses Qubits i

 They said, i have come to you and you are listening to us
 lekin tathy yah he ki mere naam main agar gandhi nahin hota to main do baar saansad nahin banataa or aap mujhe sunne ke liye yahaan nahin aate

 aapako bataa den kivarun gandhiko lekar haal hi main aisi khabaren ai thi ki varun gandhi congress ke saath jud sakate hai
 According to many local Congress workers in Agra, Varun has not got respect in the BJP according to his stature
 party main unhen nazarandaaj kiya gaya he, unamem mukhyamantri banane kii kshamta thi
 However, there was no official statement that Varun would go to Congress
 india today se khaas baat karte hue muslim netaa haji jamiluddin kaa kahana he ki bijepi main varun ko nazarandaaj kiya gaya he, bijepi main piem modi ke alaava or kisi ko apni baat kehane kaa haq nahin he
