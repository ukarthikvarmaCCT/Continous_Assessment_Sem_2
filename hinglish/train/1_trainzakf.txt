 Madhya Pradesh Sports and Youth Welfare Minister Jitu Patwari said, “tai is a heritage of Indore and a good woman
 par itihaas is baat kaa gavaah he ki agar koi bujurg chaabi chhodane ko taiyaar nahin hota he, to uske naati-pote usase chaabi chin lete hai
 i urge you (sumitra Mahajan) not to be lured by Indore's key (indore Constituency) "
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main sumitra mahajan(sumitra Mahajan) ne kaha tha ki indore kii chaabi uchit vyakti ko sahi samay par mil jaayegi
 Right now i am going to keep this key with me
 main achche se chal-phir or dekh paa rahi hum tathaa thik tarah sab sambhaal rahi hum
 Let us tell you that Sumitra Mahajan has been winning from Indore continuously since the year 1989
 jab vah pehali baris seat se chunaav ladi thim, tab unhone apane pratidwandvi or varisht congress netaa prakashchandra sethi se kaha tha ki 'chunki indore kii bahu ke rup main vah chunaav lard rahi hai
 So the keys of this seat should be handed over to them '
 tab se siyaasi galiyaaron main indore seat 'indore kii chaabi' ke rup mencharchit he
 Congress leader Jitu Patwari said that the voters of Indore had supported Sumitra Mahajan and Sethi had given you the key, but why do you have so much greed with this key? You should tell what is inside the locker whose key you want to keep with you

 The High Court is completely dissatisfied with government measures to stop dengue and chikungunya in Delhi during this monsoon
 dilli main jagah-jagah jamaa ho rahe pani par naaraaz hycourt ne dilli jal board ko bhi notice thama diya he
 The supply of water board is also being done in those places where illegal construction work is going on and due to this, the risk of mosquito breeding is increasing due to the accumulation of water in the buildings under construction
 is bich hycourt ko aaj sarkari vakil ne ye bhi bataaya ki 13 may ko ek hai level meeting bhi bulaai ja rahi he jisame dengue or chikangunia se nipatane ke liye kis tarah kii vyavastha kii jaae ise lekar ruparekha taiyaar kii jaaegi
 The High Court had already reprimanded the Delhi Government and the Civic Agency, saying that in the 21st century, where we are moving everywhere, do the Government and Civic Agency want to give dengue-chikungunya to the country's capital
 darasal court ko in maamle main teen baar sunwaayee ke baad bhi koi santoshjanak jawaab sarkaar or sabhi emsidi se nahin mil paaya ki aakhir dengue-chikangunia or malaria ko rokane kikya pukhta taiyaari he
 The court said that we do not want a status report from all of you for Khanapurti, but the big officers of every department come out on the road and give us an affidavit by making sure that there is no dirt in their area
 pichhali sunwaayee me bhi court ne kaha ki agar bade adhikari air condishan kamaron main baithkar sirf meeting karte rahenge to ilaake main safai nahin ho sakati
 This will only happen when all the top officials themselves work with the cleaning staff
 dilli hai court ne kaha ki is vakt dengue hone ke baad ilaaj par nahin balki uske bachaav par focus hona chahie
 If the cleaning is done on time, then the risk of disease will automatically reduce
 court ne ek baar phir doharaaya ki kisi bhi haal main dilli main dengue-chikangunia ko lekar wo halaat nahin hone chahie jo pichley 2-3 saal ke dauraan dekhe gayi hai
 a week ago, the High Court had heard about dengue-chikungunya, in which notices were issued to the Delhi government, MCD, Railways and the Control Board
 hoicourt ne is maamle swat sangyaan lete hue kaha ki sabhi sunishchit karen ki har haal main dengue-chikangunia or malaria ko dilli main rokane ke prayaas abhi se shuru kiye jaaen
 After May, the monsoon will arrive in Delhi and if the preparations for prevention of diseases are not started already, the results may be seen like last year
 isiilie hoicourt pehle se hi chahta he ki dilli sarkaar or teenon emsidi apni taiyaari vakt rahete puri kar len
 The High Court has clearly said that what has been prepared by everyone so far and if not done, start immediately
 court ne kaha ki degu or chikangunia ko rokane ke liye sirf puraane tareeke se hi taiyaari na kii jaae
 Rather, programs related to proper education, information and communication with them should be done to protect people from disease
 hai court ne haal hi me dengue-chikangunia ke nae maamle aspataalon main aane ke baad is maamle par swat sangyaan liya he
 The High Court has disposed of a PIL filed two years ago with some instructions, the same PIL has now started trial taking automatic cognizance
 pichley saal monsoon ke dauraan hajaaron kii taadaad main rajdhani main log chikangunia kii chapet main aa gaye the or badi taadaad main logon kii maut ho gai thi
 In 2015 too, people suffered dengue havoc in the capital
 isiilie court chahta he ki is saal sarkaar or emsidi kii taraf se koi laaparvaahee na barti jaae
 The court will hold the next hearing in this matter on May 12

 For this, he plans a road trip which is 20 minutes, but he wanders and reaches the destination in one and a half days
 film kii kahani main twist yah he ki steffni ke bare main kisi ko koi jaankaree nahin he
 For example, is he alive or not
 uskaa astitv he yaa phir vah ek kaalpanik paatr he
 That is, the story of the film has everything from mystery to adventure

 'voters' Opinion Important in Selection of Candidates' Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has said that political parties should give the opinion of voters when choosing candidates for Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki unka lakshya congress ko sabhi tak sulabh bananaa he
 Last day, Rahul Gandhi said in Kerala that in some states like Uttar Pradesh, only one person decides the names of all the candidates
 unhone kaha, ‘ek raajnneetik dal ke liye sabase ahm baat he ki vah sabhi kii aawaaj ko saamne laae
 Political parties should tell people who their candidates are
 ’rahul gandhi ne paardarshita par dhyaan dete hue kaha, ‘raajnneetik dalon kii kai prakriya logon se chhipi hui hoti hai
 If these processes are hidden, people can speak anything
 logon ko shaq hoga, agar prakiyaayein paardarshee nahin hongi
 However, what new tips Rahul Gandhi gives in his 'pathshala' will be a matter to be seen

 Pranav Johri, marketing director of Rajpal & Sons, who publishes a book like Abdul Kalam's Your Future in Your Hand, says: "understand that if a literary book sells for 1,000 a year, Young Adult Finances 2,500-3,000 but a book by Self Help Over 5,000 copies are sold
 "yah kamyaabi ke nae mukaam tay karne kii nai peedi kii chahat he, jisane pichley dedh dashak main self help kitabon ko hot kek banaaya he
 Publishers also believe that its market is growing
 vajah he badhati yuva aabaadi
 Pranav also agrees, "the number of youth in these book buyers is the highest
 aise pathak yaa to kariyar kii shuruyaat kar rahe hote hai yaa phir college main kadam rakhte hai
 70 percent of the buyers of self-help books are under 35 years of age
 "in kitabon ke bazaar ne dedh dashak pehle hi bharat main rakrataar pakadi he
 This world is quite old abroad
 yahi vajah he ki vahaan kii janchi-parkhi kitabon ko bharat main aaj bhi pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 That is why the books written by Napoleon Hill (think and be rich) almost a hundred years ago are still in the list of bestsellers
 bharat main apekshaakrit is nai field ko aage le jane main shiv kheda, pramod bataraa (safalataa ke anmol ratna), jayanti jain (utho, jaago, jito), joginder singh (safalataa se aage) or vijay agarwal jaise naam pramukhataa se liye ja sakate hai

 His new book Jio Shan Se has sold 2,000 copies so far
 haalanki unki zyaadaatar kitaaben popular angreji kitabon ke anuwaad hi hai
 For this reason, Padbrushing House has also divided the self-help section into several parts, ranging from success in life to career, life and career balance and improving relationships

 "manovishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki aise logon main in kitabon kaa mahatv or bad jaataa he, jinke paas paryaapt sansaadhan nahin

 Very sad — Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh)august 11, 201712:01 AM gulam nabi aaazaad or raaj babbar aaj gorakhpur medical college jaaenge The death of Girdhari Lal Bhargava, after the announcement of his candidature from Jaipur, prevented him from winning five consecutive victories
 samakaleen raajnneeti main aise virale hi hai jinhen janata is tarah sir maathe bithaati ho
 But soon after his departure, an important question arose, who was in his place? After a long spell, the BJP finally placed its bets on Ghanshyam Tiwari and Vasundhara Raje also supported him
 tiwadi kyon? isamen do raay nahin ki ve sachche myanon main khantee siyasatdan hai
 But even more than that, he has the ability to be a Brahmin and Jaipur seat has traditionally been considered a seat of Brahmins
 vaise, yah kahana padegaa ki bhargav kii baari lokapriyata main unke brahman hone se zyada unke janata kaa sachcha hamdard hone kaa bada role tha
 Well, once upon a time Rajmata Gayatri Devi used to win from here
 congress ne bhi yahaan se mahesh joshi ke rup main brahman pratyaashee utaara he
 Jaipur is an ideal seat for studying the political strategy of political parties
 nirnaayak tatv sirf or sirf jati he
 Just ask the top leader also, why did Phalan get a ticket from that seat? Immediately the answer will come whether there is more of such caste voters or the party's eye on such and such caste
 kisi pratyaashee kii jati vaale matadaataaon kaa vistaar agar pados vaali seat par bhi he to uski sambhaavnaaen or bhi prabal
 Suppose, Jats are angry in some area
 masalan, barmer
 Congress colonel Sonaram is upset with the party here
 aise main mana yah ja rahaa he ki jaaton kaa ek tabaka bhaajapa ke rajput pratyaashee maanavendra singh ko vot de saktaa he
 That is, look at all the castes and then give the ticket to the representative of the caste with the highest voter
 ve din lad gaye, jab vasundhara raaje ne jhalawad ko apana grih nirvachan kshetra banaaya yaa mali jati ke hote hue bhi ashok gahalot jodhpur main dabadabaa banaae rahe
 but today? Jat will have to be removed in Nagaur
 or vah jat agar nathuram mirdha kii potee jyoti mirdha ho to phir to sone main suhaaga
 In the form of Jyoti, Gehlot has brought back the legacy of veteran Jat leader in a way
 haalanki baba (nathuram) kisaanon ke hit kii ladaai main jati vagairah ke daayre se upar uth chuke the
 There are caste equations which are forcing the reserved category candidates to field general seats
 meenaon ko hi lijie
 The recent assembly election has proved that he has become the largest political fraternity, pushing the Jats back
 congress ne namonarayan meena ko savai madhopur saamaanya seat se isliye utaara kyonki dausa arakshit seat par kirodilal meena yaa kisi anya ke liye vikalp khulaa rakhana tha
 From here he has now introduced former IPS Laxman Meena
 vah meenaon ko bataanaa chaahati thi ki unki birdari ke prati vah kitni chintit he
 The equation was that Gehlot could not remove his son Vaibhav from Sawai Madhopur seat
 or mauka hone ke baavjood nijee hiton kaa balidaan karte hue gahalot ne bhi ek misaal hi banaai he
 Due to caste equations, the parties are being forced to give tickets to the leaders or their relatives lost in the assembly elections
 alvar main yadavon ke dabadabe ko dekhte hue bhaajapa ne yahaan se vidhayak jaswant yadav kii ardhangini kiran ko tikat diya he
 The Congress fielded Bhanwar Jitendra Singh as Dr
 karan yadav ko naaraaz hone kaa mauka de diya
 The Congress has chosen Jat Lalchand Kataria from Jaipur Rural, while the BJP has played bet on Rajput Rao Rajendra Singh
 kehane kii jarurat nahin ki is sabake baad muddon kii baat ke koi myne hi nahin rah jate hai
 In such a situation, if someone talks about choosing a candidate with a good image and good character, then this option remains confined to a particular caste
 pratidwandviyon ke votbank main send maarane ke liye jati ke aadhaar par kai dami pratyaashee bhi utaare ja rahe hai
 What is more ironic is that Sachin Pilot, who performed brilliantly on TV and in seminars, is introduced to the Gurjar-dominated Ajmer instead of presenting him as the face of modern Jaipur
 yahaan tak ki raaje ke putr dushyant ko bhi gurjaron kaa samarthan paane ke liye patni niharika ko vot maangane bhejnaa padaa he, jo ki usee samudaay kii hai
 So the issue is that if Kirori Lal Meena stays away from the Congress, then the Meena votes that the Congress gets will be affected
 ek dharna yah bani he ki gurjaron se samjhaute kii vajah se meena or duusari janajatiyaan bhaajapa se dur ho gai hai
 Now, Gurjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla has joined the party itself
 mudda to yah bhi he ki basapa kaa koi votbank he yaa nahin or agar he to kya yah apane chah vidhayakon ko hadapney ke liye congress ko dandit karegaa?parisemen ke baad rajput bahul hui jodhpur seat se tikat dene main congress ne zyada satarkta dikhaate hue rajput card khelaa
 The BJP has relied on its current MP Jaswant Singh Vishnoi
 rajput matadaata bhale bad gaye hon lekin badale halaat main bhi bhaajapa ko yahaan kaaphi jor aajamaaish kerani padegi
 The voters of Jat belt Osian, Bhopalgarh and Bilara who are included in the Pali will also keep their direct intervention in the victory and defeat
 yahi vajah he ki bhaajapa ne puraane ghodon ko daudaya he
 Keeping the caste equations completely in mind, Congress has brought Badriram Jakhar into Pali while giving importance to Jats, while the current BJP MP Pushp Jain is in the fray
 tikat vitaran main jatvaad sab ore haaavee he
 Due to the plurality of Kalbi votes in jalore-sirohi, both the parties have introduced Kalbi Jat candidates
 bhaajapa se devji em
 Patel and Congress are Sandhya Chaudhary
 donon partiyon ke kaaryakarta in pratyaashiyon ko pachaa nahin paa rahe hai
 Meanwhile, a CD of Chaudhary has become a gulf for the Congress
 isamen choudhary jati ke logon ko party se zyada tavajjo dene kii baat kehete hue dekhe gaye hai
 As soon as Patel's candidature was announced in the BJP, Tara Bhandari, a prominent contender, wept bitterly at the bjp's central headquarters
 bhaajapa se ab tak judi rahi raajpurohit rajput jati bhi apane pratinidhi ko tikat na milane se naaraaz dikh rahi he
 After delimitation in Jatland Nagaur, it was felt that a candidate of another caste might also be able to stand
 par aakhirkaar jyoti mirdha or bindu choudhary ke rup main vahi jati kaa daanv
 The Jat belt merta-degana, who played an important role in the parliamentary elections, went to Rajsamand district this time
 abhi tak ke sansadeey chunaavon main medta-degana se hi saansad banate aae the
 Jayal and Ladnun joined Nagaur instead of these two regions
 jaayal kshetra bhi puri jat pattee he
 In Rajsamand, the new Lok Sabha seat formed by the manipulation of four districts, BJP has fielded Ajmer MP Rasasingh Rawat
 ve isi jile ke hai
 The Congress nominated Gopal Singh Edwa, a Rajput zamindar family from Nagaur
 duusare jile kaa hone se idva ko sthaneey kaaryakartaaon kaa virodh jhelana padaa
 After the delimitation, the geography of the barmer-jaisalmer parliamentary constituency has become a relief for some and a problem for some
 lekin sidhe taur par dekhen to zyaadaatar rajput matadaataaon, jo ki bhaajapa samarthak hai, ke jodhpur loksabhaa kshetra main chale jane se uskaa sidhaa nuksaan bhaajapa pratyaashee maanavendra singh ko hoga
 In the new environment, the politics of the thieves has taken a beating
 pehali dfa chunaav lard rahe congress ke harish choudhary ladaai main hai lekin vidhayak karnal sonaaram choudhary ke bhitarghaat ke andeshe or musalmaan matadaataaon ke khulkar congress ke samarthan main na aane se choudhary maamla funs gaya he
 Out of a total of 14 lakh, two lakh Muslim voters will be decisive
 vaise yahaan sabase zyada kareeb teen lakh matadaata jat hai
 In the last election, Manvendra defeated the Colonel, who had made a triumph of victory, due to his electoral management skills
 musalmaan matadaataaon par maanavendra kaa jaadu jamkar chalaa tha
 This time Jat voters are mobilized in favor of Chaudhary
 ilaake ke 8 main se 6 vidhayak congressi hai
 Two are ministers in the state government
 gahalot ke liye bhi yah seat pratishtha kaa sawaal he kyonki choudhary ko ve hi laae hai

 Joshi's presence has made the match interesting

 There are more than 1
25 lakh Brahmins out of 92 lakh voters
 bundi kaa hindauli or nainvaan kshetra milane se gurjaron kii taadaad dedh lakh ho gai he
 Joshi relies on caste equations to break the tilism of Singh, who is involved in making a trio
 rajya sarkaar ke nav niyukt mantri raamalaal jat unhen jat vot dilaane main madadgaar ho sakate hai
 The Gujjars of Bhilwara have even threatened to let Colonel Kirori Singh Bainsla join the BJP and not let them enter the border of the district, cheating them with society
 unke chunaav ladane par kai netaaon ne unke khilaaf prachaar main utarane ko kaha he
 a spoiled vote bank from the BJP may become a "gold-based icing" for the Congress, but apart from Prahlad Gunjal's displeasure with the Congress, there is little hope for the Gujjar candidate from the BSP
 basapa ne yahaan uttar pradesh ke vigyaan or audyogic mantri harish gurjar ko ladaaya he
 In karauli-dholpur, Bharatpur and Dausa parliamentary constituencies of southeastern Rajasthan, all political equations are seen to be collapsing
 karauli-dhaulpur surakshit seat se khiladilaal bairava (congress), dow
 Manoj Rajouri (BJP) and Hattiram Jatav (BSP) are the candidates
 karauli-dhaulpur seat se jatav or khatic samaaj ko tikat mil gaya lekin coli samaaj ke daavedaaron ko kisi bhi party se tikat na mil paane se samaaj main rosh he
 Ram Singh Mahawar (koli), the head of Todabhim Panchayat Samiti, tried hard for the ticket from the Congress but could not succeed
 saamaanya rahi seat bharatpur ab arakshit (anusuchit jati) ho gai he
 The candidates are Ratan Singh Jatav (congress) and Khemchand Koli (BJP)
 jatav bharatpur congress sanghathan se kabhi bhi kisi sampark main nahin rahe
 Jatav, who was a government employee, got a Congress ticket after he retired
 vahiin coli gaanv se jude hai
 The Jat community has dominated the politics of Bharatpur, the stronghold of the King Maharajas, but after being reserved it will be interesting to see which way the Jats go
 is baar janajati ke liye arakshit hui dausa seat par mukaable ke liye purv ipies lakshmana meena congress kii ore se mukhaatib hai
 MLA from Todabhim and the staunch leader of Meena Samaj, Dr
 kirodilal meena ne nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main parchaa bharaa he
 Parasadilal Meena, Ramkishore Saini and Mamta Bhupesh, who were living with them in the assembly elections, were not present while filling their papers
 is seat se rajesh payalat, uske baad unki patni rama payalat or phir putr sachin payalat saansad rahe hai
 Qamar Rabbani of Gurjar community from rajouri-poona district of Jammu and Kashmir has also filed as an Independent
 kaise? wo aise ki jammu-kashmir main gurjar anusuchit janajati main aate hai
 It has been seen about Dausa district that the caste where it is betting, has voted in its arbitrary and arbitrary manner
 jatvaad kaa asar jhalawad seat par bhi kam nahin
 Traditionally the former chief minister and now the leader of opposition Vasundhara Raje, Jhalawar parliamentary constituency, Raje has been wooing Rajput majority voters of Jhalawar parliamentary constituency before the last 6 Lok Sabha elections and son Dushyant from last election
 parisemen ke baad nae sameekaran main vaisya samaaj ke bade vot bank ke rup main ubharne se jhalawad kshetra main padane vaale baaraa jile ke congressi vidhayak pramod jain 'bhaayaa' kii patni urmila jain ko congress ne tikat diya he
 Vaishya community has a good population in Anta assembly seat of this area and the presence of the society in Jhalawar is well
 jhalawad kshetra main rajput matadaataaon kii acchhee-khaasi paith rahi he jiske chalate raaje or unke putr yahaan se loksabhaa chunaav jitate rahe hai vahiin congress ne rajput matadaataaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vasundhara ke saamne do baar maan singh or ek baar bharat singh ko chunaav ladvaya tha
 Gurjars are also in abundance on this seat
 raaje ne jhalarpatan se 2003 main vidhansabha chunaav ladaa to rama payalat congress kii ore se unke saamne thim
 Looking at the candidates of Kota seat, the idea of caste equations is clearly visible
 bhaajapa ne puraani paripati par chalate hue brahman ummidavaar phir se utaara he
 The BJP always gave tickets to the upper castes after the seat was normalized till the 80s
 maujuuda saansad raghuveerasingh kaushal kii sehat thik na hone se is dfa bhaajapa ne shyaam sharma par daanv lagaaya he
 The geography of the Ganganagar Lok Sabha seat at the north west end of the state has also changed
 parisemen ke baad do vidhansabha kshetra tibbi or kesarisinghpur khatm ho gaye
 Nohar and Bhadra moved to Churu
 risinghnagar, suratgarh or peelibanga ko bikaner se hataakar jod diya gaya
 But one thing did not change
 wo he jaat
 Congress has won nine times and BJP three times
 par ek baar bhi koi gaiyr-meghavaal saansad nahin bana
 Birbalram, Begaram, Shankar Pannu took this forward from Pannaram Barupal
 ab yah silsilaa begaaraam ke bete nihalchand jari rakhe hue hai
 In front of him, there is Bharatram Meghwal from the Congress
 bhaajapa se dow
 O
 pi
 Mahendra and Sitaram were Maurya contenders
 par party nihalchand se aage soch hi nahin pai
 In fact, it is the compulsion of political parties to field candidates from Ganganagar reserved for Scheduled Castes
 par meghavaal hi kyon? iskaa jawaab dene kii koshish karte hue congress netaa jagadish jandu kehete hai, ''yahaan anusuchit jati ke vot bank main kareeb ek tihaai hissaa meghavaalon kaa he, isliye rajnatik dalon ko lagata he ki yah jati nirnaayak sabit hogi
 This feedback is probably becoming the basis of selection of candidates in every election
 '' rajnatik sameekaran koi bhi hon, mudde kaise bhi hon, koi bhi jite, ganganagar loksabhaa seat lagaataar 16veen baar ek meghavaal ko apana saansad chunane ja rahi he
 There is only one issue and that is that of Meghwal
 koun kah rahaa tha ki chunaav main jati kii baat karnaa loktantric drushti se adarsh nahin he
 So brother, whether the previous Vasundhara Raje government was corrupt or whether Manmohan Singh is a weak Prime Minister or not? Was Raje more energetic or Gehlot? Will the BJP prove to be better at the Center or Congress? All these things belong to the committed vote bank of the parties
 jehan main aati hai
 The parties believe that other people vote on the caste line
 or partiyon kii yah dharna amuman sach hi sabit hui he
 The politics of Rajasthan has become more casteist

 england ke khilaaf lords main khele gaye duusare test match main team india kaa lachar pradarshan use le duba
 In this rain-affected Test match, Team India lost the match on the fourth day by an innings and 159 runs
 overcast condishans main bhartiya ballebaajon ke paas aag ugalate english gendbaajon ke saamne koi jawaab nahin tha
 After being piled up for 107 runs in the first innings, Virat's men surrendered in the second innings as well and collapsed for just 130 runs
 lords test match main captain viraat kohli kii kuch galtiyaan team india par baari padi hai
 From team selection to captaincy front, Virat was seen battling
 aaie ek najar daalate hai team india kii galatiyon par:1
 Out-of-form Rahul replaces Dhawan: Virat Kohli retained out-of-form Lokesh Rahul in place of Shikhar Dhawan in the Lord's Test match
 rahul ke pradarshan kii baat karen to maujuuda england daure par tii-20 siries ke pehle mukaable main 101 ranon kii pari khilne ke baad rahul ne agle do tii-20 maichon main 6 or 19 ran banaae
 After this, Rahul scored 9 and 0 in the first two matches of the ODI series, after which he was dropped from the third ODI
 rahul ko khilaane ke liye kohli ne pehle test main pujaara ko drop kiya, jisamen is ballebaaj ne 4 or 13 ran banaae
 As a result Team India lost the match by 31 runs
 had to tab ho gai jab is out of form ballebaaj ko lords test main khilaane ke liye captain kohli ne dhawan ko drop kar diya
 Rahul scored 8 and 10 runs in the Lord's Test match
 2
 No break for tail batsmen: Sam Buren proved to be a headache for Team India in the Birmingham Test when they reduced England's score to 87 for 180 in the second innings
 lords test main kris vokes ne saatven number par ballebaaji karte hue apane kariyar kaa pehla shatak jadte hue naabad 137 ranon kii pari khelkar team india ko match se baahar kar diya
 When Vokes came to bat, England's score at that time was 131 for 5 wickets
 unhone chathe wicket ke liye johny beresto ke saath milakar 189 ranon kii saajhedaari kar di
 3
 umesh yadav kii jagah kuldeep yadav kaa sellection:lords test match ke paanchon din barish kaa purvanumaan tha or match ke dauraan ruk-ruk kar barish hona tay thi
 But despite this, Indian captain Virat Kohli gave the opportunity to the chinaman Kuldeep Yadav in place of fast bowler Umesh Yadav in overcast conditions
 bhartiya team match main kuldeep yadav ke rup main atirikt spin gendbaaj ke saath utari jabaki jab paristhiti tej gendbaajon ke mutabik thi or aisa laga ki teesraa tej gendbaaj team kii madad karata
 The Indian team management's bets backfired due to rain
 4
 Pujara's run-out in the first innings: On the Lord's pitch, which was difficult for Indian batsmen to stand on, it was necessary for a batsman like Pujara to stand but in the first innings, due to the wrong call of captain Virat Kohli, he was run out and lost his wicket
 Had it, otherwise the picture of India's first innings would have been different
 duusari pari main pujaara ne 87 gendon kaa saamana kiya
 Although he scored 17 runs during that period, the situation was more important to maintain the wicket than to score at that time
 number teen par bhartiya team ke liye kaaphi ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale pujaara ne test cricket main ab tak 59 maichon kii 99 pariyon main 49
 He has scored 4549 runs at an average of 45 and his highest score is 206 runs
 5
 Kartik flopped in wicketkeeping and batting preferred: Dinesh Karthik, who has been included in the Indian team in place of Wriddhiman Saha, is neither able to do wicketkeeping nor batting
 birmingham se lekar lords tak kuch bhi nahin badla karthik wicket ke peeche jujhate hue najar aae
 Apart from this, Karthik scored 0 and 20 runs in the Birmingham Test
 karthik ne lords test match main 1 or 0 ran banaae
 Amid the ongoing debate on intolerance in the country, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar of Art of Living has said that he does not find the country intolerant
 ravishankar ne yah bhi kaha ki aword lautaanaa kahin sahi nahin he
 This did not fit the image of the country
 ravishankar ne kaha ki is desh kii mukhyadhara kii janata bahut sahishnu he
 And i would say that it is in our DNA
 aap yah nahin kah sakate kidesh achaanak ashishnu ho gayaahai

 Sushil Kumar Shinde's statement on the merger of congress-ncp, Shinde said- They grew up under the same tree, will come together and separated from Congress in 1999
 Pawar had formed NCP during the assembly election campaign in Maharashtra and senior Congress leader and former Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has given a big statement
 scindia ne ummid jaahir kii he ki bhavishya main congress or rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ek saath aaenge

 pavaar ne congress ke netritv ke masale par hi party chodi thi
 Now that the two parties are contesting elections together in Maharashtra and are struggling to maintain their existence, Shinde's statement on the merger of the two parties is very important

 It was a fatah pulled from the jaws of defeat
 congress kekai log manobal todgaye vaali sabase tazatreen haar—ahamed patel kii rajyasabha seat ganvaane—ke liye khud ko taiyaar kar chuke the
 But at midnight, when the date of August 8 changed to August 9, and big leaders of both BJP and Congress were busy on their phones and chewing nails, the Election Commission came as a savior and it really drove the Congress out of the crisis
 chunaav ayog ne congress ke baagiyon ke do vot avaidh qaraar dekar khaarij kar die,jisase patel ko upree sadan main paanchvaan kaarykaal jeetne ke liye45ke bajaae44voton kii jarurat rah gai
 He got exactly 44 votes, which he needed
 tajjub kya ki congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne kaha,''shukr he chunaav ayog he
 "the party was on the other side in June last year, when it was calling the Election Commission bad to declare its 12 votes invalid in Haryana's Rajya Sabha elections
 patel sonia gandhi ke rajnatik sachiv or kattar vafaadaar hai
 If Patel has strong friends, then he has also created powerful enemies who are not ready to forgive him
 unamem pramukh hai bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah
 Shah had to spend three months in jail in 2010 and this was due to the charges related to the alleged murder of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, who was in police custody five years ago
 kuch vakt ke liye hi,par isse shah ke siyaasi kariyar ko nuksaan pahunchaa or iske liye unhone patel ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 On August 8, Shah, elected from Gujarat for his first term in the Rajya Sabha, made it his mission to oust Patel from the Rajya Sabha seat, expedite his political abolition and pursue the possibility of creating a "congress-free India"
 shah kii badla lene kii jabardast ichha or patel ko beizzat karne kii teevr kaamana ne ek neeras tathaa feeki siyaasi ghatana ko gairmamuli mukaable main badal diya
 It was for this reason that instead of meditating on a difficult and tedious campaign, including the party's indecent disarray, the Congress is celebrating as if it has been reborn
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki patel bhi nattejey se is kadar dravit dikhaai de rahe the jitna unhen pehle kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 Saving his seat had become a prestige issue for him
 patel jaanate the ki haar se congress ke bheetar un logon ke hausale bhi buland ho jaaenge jo party main unki pakad ko kamjor hote dekhnaa chaahate hai
 When Rajya Sabha member and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that the Congress was treating the Sultans well even after leaving their sultanate, some people interpreted this as a sarcasm on Patel
 ramesh congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke najdiki bharosemand hai or patel ke abhiyaan main unki gairmaujuudagi saaf dikhaai detii thi
 Rahul too did not show much enthusiasm to the leaders who had Patel patronage
 inamen himant biswa sarama bhi the jo pichley saal paala badalakar bhaajapa main chale gaye the
 "the methods of politics of Rahul and Patel are different," says a young Congress MP

 In a fashion show on the lines of the Victoria Secret Style Show in China, the catwalk of Child Models has surprised many
 china ke sichuaan praant main 5 saal kii umr tak kii choti-choti bacchiyon ne bikini or undervier main catwalk kiya

 One user wrote, 'I am not a supporter of children's participation in such activities
 main apane bacchon ko khel ke maidan main dhul se sanaa hua dekhnaa zyada pasand karuunga
 'these countries, concerned with the dwindling population, want people to do more,' says Dr
 Ekta Soni of sexappollo, it is not just a fashion show but a deliberate way to show the sexuality of small girls
 is tarah kii gatividhiyon main unhen shaamil karne se unhen acha dikhne, apane vajan or anya chizon ko lekar zyada parvaah hone lagegi
 Such shows are also likely to increase the incidence of child abuse

 bijepi ke varisht netaa or purv upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi kaa aarope he ki sarkaar aam janata se suzav maangane kaa naatak kar rahi he
 He says that before enacting the law, the government used to consult the public, but for the first time, after 6 months of enacting and implementing the prohibition law, the government is seeking public opinion

 He questioned the government and asked why the government has failed to enforce full prohibition despite imprisonment of more than 18 thousand people and confiscation of more than 3 lakh liters of liquor under the prohibition law

 As a result, the Chief Minister has had to bow down within six months, which is a moral victory for the opposition

 5 Director: Divya Khosla Kumarakalaakar: Pulkit Samrat, Yami Gautam, Urvashi Rautela and Rishi Kapoor make love stories is not an easy task
 lekin bollywood main jis tarah se in dinon prem kahaniyon kii aavak he, use dekhakar yahi lagata he ki prem kahaniyaan bananaa sabase aasaan kaam he
 Divya Khosla Kumaraki's film 'saanam Re', wife of T-series owner Bhushan Kumar, is also a love story with weak storylines and cold casting
 jisamen ishk kii garmi kaa nitant abhaav he
 The director's effort to keep the audience engaged is more about presenting beautiful scenes than tying them up with a love story
 kahani main kitna damakahani ek chote shahar ke ladakepulakit samrataki he, jiskaa ladakpan main yami gautam se pyaar hota he
 But in the struggle of career, he has to leave the small area and move towards the metropolis
 is tarah pyaar peeche chhot jaataa he
 As is often the case in our films, destiny is also something
 phir donon ek duusare se takaraate hai
 Awareness awakens but in the meantime a character Urvashi Rautela is also in the middle
 haai profile soshlite
 This is how the story has a twist
 storiline bahut hi saamaanya he
 Although the songs are definitely good to listen to
 star apilpulakit samraat vahi hai jo 'bittu bos' or 'phukare' jaisi filmein kar chuke hai
 He is seen working very hard in the film, and this hard work is also seen in his six packs
 unki acting thik hi he
 Yami Gautam seems to be trying to become an innocent hill girl, but she has not been able to create the character that should be in romantic films
 pulakit or yami kii chemistry bhi thandi he
 Urvashifilm comes to taste hotness
 acting ke maamle main vah bhi thik hi hai
 Rishi Kapoor has also done a good job
 kamai kii batfilm ko lo bajet bataaya jaataa he
 The music is quite good
 khubasurat najaare hai
 But the script could not be so overwhelming
 vailemtine weekend main film relies ho rahi he or ise bade str par relies bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 But today's love is not seen in the film and the film will have to deal with this problem at the box office
 ek muhaavara he ki ek kadam aage badhanaa or do kadam peeche janaa
 Perhaps these days we have taken too much of this idiom
 ham ek kadam aage badhaakar sirf do kadam peeche nahin ja rahe hai, balki peeche kii or daud lagane main lage hai
 The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is implementing this phrase very quickly
 iskaa nayaa karnama hollywood kii superhit film fifty shades of grey kii relies par roak he
 The film has created new records at the worldwide box office
 edlt certificate hone ke baavjood bhi 50 karod dollar kii kamai kar chuki he
 Some people would like to live this fantasy, some read: EL James: The story of this film is written by a woman
 jisaki kitaab ko duniya bhar main auraton ne sabase zyada padhaa he
 The film is a story of a girl and a boy
 film estheticli banaai gai he or bilkul bhi porn movie jaisi nahin he
 But what do we have? We are the clean ones
 isliye board ne is film kii relies ko rokkar khud ko malaysia, kenya, indonesia or kai khadi deshon kii qatari main laa khadaa kiya he
 Sam taylor-johnson's film featured a number of sex scenes and was edited in Indian terms
 lekin nahin to nahin
 'fifty Shades of Gray' will not be released here
 It seems that our board does not consider us worthy of this film
 use hamaari samaj par bharosa nahin
 He feels that Indians do not have the ability to digest such a subject
 un hindustaniyon main jinaki filmon main shuru se jabaran prem, sex or rape kii ghatnaayen aam rahi hai
 Where there was never an attempt to find out what the children have been meaning to extinguish the lamp when the rape is done and the heroine comes out of the room tired after being victimized by Ranjeet
 vahaan aisi film ke khilaaf morcha taiyaar he jisamen jabaran jaisi koi cheez nahin he
 That too at a time when a large part of this country belongs to the youth
 dhyaan rahe ki 2012 main jab sensor board ne da girl vid dragon tatu film ke kuch aapattijanak sex seens ko kaatane kii baat kahi to film ke diarector ne bharat main isaki relies ko hi roak diya tha
 Indeed, the unfolding of such sentences presents only one more color out of the dark colors of our modern society

 L
 james ne likhaa or yah raturaat surkhiyon main aa gai
 Of course, any form of sex has been shown in this book, but its author had said, "the women love a good love story and have a similar love story from Fifty Shades of Gray Dil"
 
 ' beshak film main is baat ko bakhubi ukerne kii koshish bhi gai he
 Let's know what the story is
 
 
 ek sidhi-saadi ladki enstesia he
 Sharmaai and Ghrabai-c
 vah ek bijness tykun chrishchiyan grey se ittefacan milti he
 He likes her but Ana moves forward thinking where Arsh and where the floor
 lekin chrishchiyan kaa dil us ladki par aa jaataa he
 Ana realizes that love has no place in Christian's life
 donon kareeb aate hai
 Ana likes Christian
 vah use pasand karne lagati he
 Both take steps forward
 chrishchiyan ana ke saath sex karata he
 Sex is just like any common lover couple
 lekin chrishchiyan kii duniya to ekadam alag hoti he, jisamen chamade ke hunter, rassiyaan, hathkadiyaan or sex ke dauraan apane saathi ko pidaa dene kii bhavanaaen kuta-kuta kar bhari hai
 Christian tells Ana all the truth
 apana redroom bhi dikhaata he jo is tarah ke sex toij se bharaa hota he
 Then a contract is formed which Ana has to sign before stepping into this Christian world
 ana bidisam (bondej or disiplin sadism or masochism yani bandhan or anushaasan, dard or majaa) se judi jaankaree jutati he
 Then she accepts some of the contract conditions and enters into the world of Christian aching pleasure
 pehla encounter spanking kaa hota he (ana ke nitambon par chaanten maarna)
 It is followed by furious sex in the bedroom
 phir ek din ana chrishchiyan se kahati he ki vah use sazaa de kyonki vah is contract kii hadon ko dekhnaa chaahati he
 Christian strikes Ana's buttocks with a belt and then the distance between the two increases
 
 
 haalanki yah ek trilogy he or isaki do filmein abhi or aani hai
 There is no mention of spanking even in Kamasutra, it is not mentioned that only innocent type of sex is described in India and we Indians have been having sex only to have children
 vatsyayan ke kamasutra main is baat kaa ishaara mil jaataa he ki hamane saikadon saal pehle hi sex main simaaen langhna sikh liya tha
 Kamasutra says: Sex is a form of quarrel because logic is rooted in the root of lust and its character is of an intransigent kind
 sex ke dauraan kin sthalon par or kis tarah se halke or tej chaante (spanking) jamaane hai, iskaa zikr he
 Chante can be placed on the shoulders, head, between breasts and on the back
 yah ulte haath, haath kholkar, hatheli or hatheli ke flats hisse ke jariye jade ja sakate hai
 Not only this, there is also mention of teeth biting and pinch biting, but for this it is also necessary to have the approval of the front side because few women find pleasure in such behavior
 kamasutra un sarvapratham kitabon main se he jo dard main sukh or sex ke dauraan suraksha jaise vishyon par mukharata ke saath bolti he

 Taking a dig at Mulayam Singh, Congress spokesperson Sandeep Dixit said that he should not talk like this
 unke bina bhi upie sarkaar chalegi
 The Congress said, 'those who do not come continuously to their state and remain in the discussion due to poor law and order
 unhen is tarah se baat nahin kerani chahie
 'significantly, the Prime Minister told the media in his special aircraft that the UPA government will complete its term

 Earlier, Mulayam described the Congress as a hoaxer
 daawa kiya ki third front kii sarkaar banegi
 And he also praised his arch rival Advani
 jiske baad se siyaasi halchal tej ho gai
 On the third front, 'politics', these words of the leader show that he has set his line and length on the pitch of politics

 Information Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari says that the Third Front government is impossible

 sapa-basapa ke baad congress ne pradesh main akele hi chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar daalaa

 bihar ke maathe se aakhirkaar yah kaalikh hat gai ki uske apane bijligharon se shunya megawatt utpaadan hota he
 Right after 10 years, but the chimney of a power plant of the Bihar government is blowing smoke
 aisa lagata he ki nitish bijli main aatmanirbharta kaa apana chunavi vaada puraa karne kii ore bad rahe hai
 Since October 2003, power generation was at a standstill at the Kanti Thermal Power Station on the banks of NH-28, about 90 km from Patna, the capital of Bihar
 iskaa parisar maweshiyon ke liye charaagaah banakar rah gaya tha or iske chaalu hone kii ummid dam tod chuki thi
 But on November 17, 10 years after the record generation of electricity started here, this old power station was drenched with lights
 pehle charan main jirnoddhar or aadhunikeekaran ke baad chaalu ek puraani unit se nirdhaarit 110 megawatt kii kshamta se do megawatt adhik bijli utpaadan ho rahaa he, jabaki isse pehle kanti kii donon puraani unit se kabhi bhi puri kshamta bhar bijli utpaadan nahin hua tha
 The power generation started in Kanti is modest according to Bihar's requirement
 lekin mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne utpaadan shuru karwaakar logon kaa bharosa kaayam rakhane kii koshish kii he
 At the inaugural function of the unit in Kanti, he said, "I had promised in Kanti's meeting in 2005 that the smoke would come out of thermal power if the government were formed
 maine apana vaada puraa kiya
 The Chief Minister said that he wants to produce 6,000 MW of electricity by 2015, work is going on for this
 akele kanti power stesan se agle saal ke ant tak 610 megawatt bijli utpaadan kii yojana he
 Earlier in October, 330 MW power has been started in Bihar from one unit of ntpc's Flood Power Station and four other units are to be built
 yahaan do charnon main 660 megawatt kii paanch unit banani hai jisamen rajya kii hissedari badhaane ke liye dabaav badhaayaa gaya he
 Bihar Energy Minister Vijendra Prasad Yadav says, "we commissioned the Kanti power station which was closed for 10 years
 sarkaar apane vaade ko puraa karne ke liye bhi sakriy he
 However, the Chief Minister admits that there are also hindrances in power generation
 power stesan ke nirmaan main jameen adhigrahan, paryaavaran vibhaag se manjuuri or kol linkage lene padate hai
 But he reiterated that by 2015 he aims to provide electricity to every village in the state
 agar aisa nahin hua to ve vot maangane nahin jaaenge
 He said this about a year ago on 15 August
 urja mantri vijendra prasad yadav logon se kah chuke hai ki mukhyamantri ke vaade ko koi mantri puraa nahin karata to use bane rahane kaa adhikaar nahin he

 usamen se 9,200 karod ru
 Are being spent on electricity

 Because Burhan Wani used to give messages only through social media

 trinmul congress ke varisht netaa makul roy party pramukh mamata banerjee ke rail mantri ke pad se istipha dene ke baad nae rail rajya mantri honge
 Sources in the Prime Minister's Office said that Minister of State for Shipping Roy would take over the additional charge of the Railways
 unhone bataaya ki rail mantralay, mantrimandal str par pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke paas hi rahegaa
 The Prime Minister has accepted Mamta's resignation with immediate effect

 narendra modi ke chehron se sushobhit hote postaron ke saath bijepi chunaavon ke liye joshokhrosh ke saath maidan main he, lekin is sari gahamagahami ke bich ek vyakti gaayab haih vah hai vigyaan, praudyogiki or prithvi vigyaan ke liye kendriya mantri harsh vardhan
 The man, belated but the face of the party's campaigning in the last assembly elections, has been marginalized this time
 2013 main, apni saaf-suthri chhavi ke chalate harshavardhan ko bhrashtachar-virdohi ladaake se netaa bane aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal kaa muqabla karne ke liye sarvasammati se bijepi kaa pratyaashee chunaa gaya tha
 Many senior leaders of the party at the time recognized that the bjp's slight gain over AAP - 32 seats as against 28 - was mainly due to Vardhan being projected as a possible chief minister
 tatkaaleen bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ko tab vardhan ke naam par shuru main hichak dikhaane ke liye party ke logon kii aalochana kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa tha, kyonki zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa tha ki isi deree kii vajah se bijepi ko dilli main bahumat nahin mil paaya
 a BJP leader said, "the image of Vardhan in a party dominated by many factions, who always loved him, always made him a favorite
 ”lekin 2015 main aaen to chunaav prachaar ke morche par ve kahin najar nahin aate
 Last year, he was removed from the unicameral assembly and put up for Lok Sabha elections
 sutron kaa kahana he ki vah bhi vijay goyal ko chandani chowk se chunaav ladgaye se rokane kii koshish kaa nateeja tha
 It also meant that Harshavardhan was also likely to become Union Minister instead of former Delhi Pradesh BJP President and sitting Rajya Sabha member Vijay Goel
 harshavardhan agar swasthya mantri hi rahete, jo ki unhen pehla vibhaag mila tha, to dilli ke chunaavon se pehle usase unki chhavi ko kaaphi dhar mili hoti
 But a few months later, he was demoted and handed over to the current department
 dilli main party ke chunaav prachaar ke prabandhan main sanlagn ek varisht bijepi netaa ne in daavon ko khaarij kar diya ki vardhan ko isliye ‘halkaa’ vibhaag diya gaya tha, taaki ve dilli main zyada samay laga saken
 He said, “the Prime Minister keeps a close watch on his ministers
 vardhan kaa jo dharnatmak demoshan he, vah darasal sarkaar kii najar main unke apeksha se kam pradarshan kaa nateeja he
 "however, to ignore the benign Vardhan, cite Modi's policy of not choosing Lok Sabha members for the post of Chief Minister

 We have invited them many times but i do not know what they want or what their government wants
 lekin nishchit taur par pakistan or bharat ke bich siries honi chahie kyonki yah ashes se badi he or main jaanata hum ki bhartiya log hamen khelte hue dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Afridi added, "I remember how well it was welcomed when the Indian team came here in 2004 and 2006

 But if they do not want to play, then it is not an issue
 ham acchhee tiimon ke khilaaf khel sakate hai
 'misbah-ul-haq also supported Afridi
 On this occasion, Pakistan Test captain misbah-ul-haq also said that cricket should be kept away from politics and he appealed for the resumption of bilateral series between India and Pakistan
 misabah ne lahore main punjab vishvavidhyalay kii yatra ke dauraan patrakaron se kaha ki vah hameshaa bharat or pakistan ke niyamit rup se ek duusare ke khilaaf khilne kii vakaalat karte rahe hai

 The PCB is desperate to organize the series and has also sent a letter to the Indian Cricket Board confirming it

 "hopefully there will be a series and we will play against India not only in limited overs but in Test matches," Misbah said

 The Supreme Court today stayed the Tamil Nadu government's decision to release the three convicts who were relieved of the death penalty in the Rajiv Gandhi murder case
 court ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar ke is nirnay main kuch prakriyaatgat khamiyaan hai
 On the verdict, Kapil Sibal said that his petition was against three people (santhan, Murugan and Perarivalan)
 baaki hatyaron ke khilaaf (nalini shriharan, robert paayas, ravichandran or jayakumar) bhi yachika daayar karenge
 a three-member bench headed by Chief Justice p Sadasivam directed the state government to maintain status quo in the case of these three prisoners
 in teen kaidiyon kii maut kii sajaa sheersh adaalat ne umr kaid main tabdeel kar di thi
 The court said that in the case of amnesty of four other convicts, the Center can file a new petition
 court ne kendra sarkaar kii arji par sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki rajya sarkaar ne kanoon main pratipaadit sabhi prakriyaagat binduon kaa paalan nahin kiya he
 Therefore, the questions raised in the application of the Center will be considered
 court ne kaha ki vah kaidiyon kii sajaa maaf karne kaa rajya sarkaar kaa adhikaar chin nahin rahaa he, lekin rajyon ko prakriya kaa paalan karnaa hoga
 The court also issued notices to the Tamil Nadu government and the culprits
 in sabhi ko do saptaah ke bheetar notice kaa jawaab dena he
 The court will now consider the matter further on 6 March
 isse pehle, tamilnadu sarkaar ne kendra sarkaar kii arji par joardaar tareeke se virodh kiya
 The state government requested not to order a stay on the release of the prisoners
 is par nyaayadhishon ne kaha, ham rajya sarkaar ke adhikaar ko kamatar karke nahin aank rahe hai, lekin uske dwaara apanaai gai prakriya par gaur kar rahe hai
 The Court held that the conversion of capital punishment to life imprisonment cannot result in an automatic pardon and that due process has to be followed in law before release of prisoners from jail
 isse pehle aaj subah kendra sarkaar ne is maamle ke doshiyon ko reeha karne ke tamilnadu sarkaar ke faisle par roak ke liye nyaayalay main arji daayar kii
 The court agreed to hear this
 kendra sarkaar kii ore se solicytor general mohan paraasaran ne rajya sarkaar ke faisle par roak lagane kaa anurodh kiya
 He said that the state government should not be allowed to release these prisoners until the apex court's decision to commute the death sentence of the three convicts to life imprisonment is decided
 sheersh adaalat ne dayaa yachikaaon ke nibatare main 11 saal kaa vilamb hone ke aadhaar par rajeev gandhi hatyakand main doshi santan, murugan (donon srilankai tamil hai) or perarivalan kii maut kii sajaa ko umr kaid main tabdeel kar diya tha
 After this decision of the court, the state government on Wednesday decided to release all the seven convicts in the case

 Women and men have different opinions about romance
 mahilaayein jahaan purushon ke bare main ye sochati hai ki ladki ko dekhte hi uske whital figure ke bare main wo jarur sochate hai
 Those men consider women a bit crude in terms of romance
 mahilaayein ye maanati hai kipurushon ke dimag main24 ghante sex chalata he, jabaki purush ye maanate hai ki jaruri naa ho to mahilaayein sex ke bare main sochati hi nahin
 This disclosure was made in the result of a recent survey
 haalanki survey ke dauraan purushon ne is baat seinkaar nahin kiyaaki wo zyaadaatar vakt sex ke bare main sochate hai
 But it is not as if he can dominate their conduct
 romance or sexco lekar purush chaahate hai ki mahilaon ko kuch chijen pataa hon
 Just like women, men like to hear their compliments
 khaastaur se romance ke dauraan ladki agar unki tarif karti he to unhen acha lagata he
 Some other things too
 
 
 1
 After forming a relationship, men want to be quiet for a while
 kuch ekant chaahate hai
 Women, on the contrary, want good things and hugs
 2
 Men want women to know that sex is a physical necessity, not a custom, which requires foreplay or emotional burden
 zyada mote log nahin lete romance main dilchaspee, kaaran jaanakar ho jaaenge hairaan
 
 
 3
 un kshanon main kai baar mahilaayein phek orgasm kaa bhi dikhaava karti hai
 Men don't want this
 purush chaahate hai ki sambandh banane ke dauraan mahilaayein, jo mahasoos karen, vahiin dikhaaen
 4
 romance se pehle mahilaon kaa mechap karnaa or khud ko taiyaar karnaa purushon ko acha lagata he

 The minority Muslim community has been in front of Europeans angry over the killing of 12 staff members of the magazine by the terrorists
 muslim germany main aatank ke viruddh raily bhi nikaal rahe hai
 But the contradiction that started on creating the shape of the Prophet remained there
 itnaa hi nahin ab to vah akruti global or viral hone ja rahi he
 This marks a new era of culture war in Europe
 europea deshon kii ek taasir rahi he ki vahaan faisle bahut teji se liye jate hai
 Example 1
 world trade centre par hamale ke baad aatank ke viruddh shuru hui jang main spain bhi america kaa sahyogi tha
 In 2004, four metro stations in Madrid bombed by terrorists
 200 log maare gaye or do hajaar ghayal hue
 The pressure on the government increased in Spain and the entire army of Spain was immediately called from Afghanistan and Iraq
 2
 People started making noise in support of homosexuality against the beliefs of the Catholic Church

 Azad Khayal did not approve of compromise with his 'independence' to the European community

 Whatever faith the Prophet Mohammed has in the world, Europe is unfazed by it

 There were small and big demonstrations against them

 These days there are also reports of many French Muslims joining the ongoing war in Syria and returning to France from there
 aise main charlie abdo par hamalaa logon kii bheetar kii aag ko sulgaane kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 For the first time, the French government has deployed thousands of soldiers within the country
 bataaya gaya he ki yah tainaati desh ke samvedansheel sthanon or yahudee skulon kii suraksha main kii gai he
 But one of the reasons for this is to prevent a potentially major violence in the country
 aarthik badahaali or berogari se jujh rahe france main abhi kisi ne nae sirdard kii gunjaaish nahin he
 But this is a temporary ceasefire
 french pahchaan or saadhe chaar karod pravasi muslim aabaadi ke bich sangharsh kaa 'under-karant' bahata rahegaa
 Charlie Addo will again feature a cartoon of Prophet Mohammed
 yah bhi aashcharya nahin ki is baar uski 30 lakh pratiyaan minuton main bik jaaen
 And the online copy of this magazine should go viral in the world
 phir muslim kattarpanthi kya karenge?jang to honi hi he

 23 sitambar 2015 ko 1965 ke bharat-paak yuddh ko 50 saal puure ho gaye
 When the two neighbors are arguing as to who had the upper hand in that battle, we heard the real story of that war based on their experience from a former soldier who had fought for the country in that war
 captain jayant saranjme bhale hi ab 76 saal ke ho chuke hai lekin 1965 kaa wo yuddh aaj bhi unhen kal kii baat lagata he, jab unhone apni sherdili ke dam par 15 sitambar 1965 ko pakistani tinkon dwaara bhartiya sena par kiye gaye hamale ko naakaam kar diya tha
 Read the story of Captain Jayant's acid test of his own black night, that night of 15 September 1965 was like an acid test for us
 brigade commander brigadier e ke luthra ne hamen sialkot cantonment or uske saamne sthit 168 infantry brigade sector main 8000 land mins bichaane ke liye sirf 6 ghante kaa vakt diya tha
 Two days before this, on 13 September, Pakistani Patton tanks attacked in the Indian Army Battalion Area, forcing our troops to retreat from the Kalarwanda post won on 12 September
 tactikali ye post mahatvapurn thi kyonki is par ek hillock tha jiskaa bhugolic mahatv yah he ki isse aap dushman se ek kadam aage rahete hai
 At an operational meeting in the morning of 15 September 1965, on 15 September, Colonel Prem Kumar, commanding officer of the 8 JAK Rifles, decided to repel the battalion as they did not have artillery support
 unhone is bare main safai bhi di
 Colonel Prem Kumar had seen 300 of his 900 soldiers being crushed by Pakistani tanks at Akhnoor near the Chenab river on 5 August 65
 karnal prem ke dimag main abhi wo buree yaad jisase sainikon kaa manobal tut sa gaya tha, bilkul taaja thi
 And now again on September 13, Pakistani Patton tanks further aggravated the problems of their men because they had only rifles and machine guns
 koi bhi anti tanks hathiyaar nahin tha
 Brutier A's Luthralekin brigade commanders adamant on insistence were not ready to hear anything
 wo chaahate the ki karnal prem saunpe gaye kaam ko har haal main puraa karen
 He proceeded with his infantry to Colonel Prem Kumar and ordered him to take possession of the Kalarwanda post again
 is kaam main chhipe khatre ko dekhte hue karnal kii jubaan ko maano kaath maar gaya or wo sochane lage ki aakhir sirf paidal sena ke sahare ham ye dushkar kaary kaise karenge
 The colonel demanded that he need a land mine in front of his battalion area
 jisase counter atake ke vakt unke aadamiyon ko thodi suraksha mili
 Story Eight thousand Land Mines Kibrigade Commander Luthra gave 8000 mines and gave second lieutenant Saranjme the responsibility to install them
 second leftinent jayant saranjme ne is kaam kii jimmedaari lete hue marking, khudaai or mins kii dhulaai ke liye karnal prem kii batalian se atirikt javaanon kii maang kii
 Colonel Prem had no option but to engage his riflemen in digging and hauling, he said yes
 8 JAK rifles ke alaava do anya batalions ne bhi is kaam main madad kii
 The brigade commander next ordered Mines to arm the truck itself
 haalanki aamtaur par mine ko pit main daalane ke baad use arm kiya jaataa he
 The reason behind the selection of Second Lieutenant Jayant Saranjme by the brigade commander for this task was the unwavering trust of the commander
 yuva saranjme kuch hi maheene pehle hajaaron land mins ko laga or nikaal chuke the
 8000 land mines were loaded in 10 trucks by the young lieutenant's Sheridillius night
 second leftinent saranjme or unke 61 javaanon ne apni jaan ko jokhim main daalate hue activated land mins se laden un trakon main apni yatra shuru kii
 In the dark night, the truck started moving towards Sialkot
 military ke drivers ne bina hedlite jalaae un loded trakon ko badi kushalta se maidan ke raste se nikaala
 The trucks' parking lights were also switched off to hide this movement
 army trakon ke tair pressure ko is tarah se manage kiya gaya tha ki trek uchhalein naa jisase unamem rakhi mins fatkar bheeshan durghatana kaa kaaran naa bane
 The enemy did not even know what happened according to some plan and all the teams reached their respective floors, so the task of planting land mines was settled an hour before midnight
 is vakt tak dushman bhi satark hota dikh rahaa tha
 The Pakistani army started firing mortars
 mashin gan kii firing, bamon kaa fatna, goliyaan har taraf bas dhamaakon kaa hi shor tha
 It seemed as if the clock was ticking a bit faster than usual
 maanon pairon ke neeche se ret phisalati ja rahi thi
 Under such circumstances, a common man's heart would start beating twice as fast, but to deal with such a situation, second lieutenant Jayant Saranjme, with his jawans, divided into three groups, with quiet but fast pace and full skill, one after the other
 i was laying a land mine
 dushman kii naak ke neeche laga daali land minsjayant ke dussahas kaa anumaan isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki us raat unhone apane javaanon ke saath dushman ke kheme se mahaj 1500 meter kii duuri tak mins bicha daali thim or dushman ko kaanon kaan khabar nahin ho pai thi
 Lieutenant Jayant very cleverly took help of dry leaves of the trees in this work and also laid a land mine on the paved road and covered it with dry leaves
 apane is kaam ke liye unhen 1966 main galentry aword sena medal se nawaja gaya, lekin aaj bhi unki veerta kisi ansuni daastaan kii tarah he
 People do not know what Captain Jayant did in that 1965 battle
 captain jayant ko ye baat bhi salti he ki records main ye baat kahin bhi nahin he ki unhone 1965 kii ladaai me 8000 land mins bichaai thim

 He was told that the PM candidate would be announced on the 17th
 desh bhar ke congress kaaryakarta aae to the piem lene, lekin waapas lekar gaye gas silendar
 Addressing the bjp's two-day National Council meeting, Modi said, "I see two reasons why Rahul Gandhi is not made the Prime Ministerial candidate
" raajnneetik kaaran to hai hi, lekin iske saath ek maanviya kaaran bhi he
 When the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections seems certain and the destruction is visible, then no mother is ready to offer political sacrifice to her son
 to maa kaa yahi nirnay rahaa 
 
 mere bete ko bachaao
 Taking forward his backward caste card, he said that one of the reasons behind not making Rahul a prime ministerial candidate is because he was born in a higher clan and there is a fear among the elite that the candidate in front of him , He is born in a backward caste
 modi ne kaha, pradhanmantri pad kii daud se bhaagane kaa or bhi kaaran he, vah yah he ki jis parampara main vah paley bade hai or jis parivaar ke hai or jis tarah vah jite hai, unke man kii rachana bhi samantshahi hoti he

 The Congress is feeling ashamed to face the tea party

 You elected a ruler for 60 years
 
 i appeal to the people that you gave 60 years to the rulers, now give 60 months to this servant
 ab sevak kaa samay aa gaya he
 Modi quipped, our views are nationalist and his (congress) views are dynastic

 The PMO responded when the applicant also sought leave records of former Prime Ministers, seeking a copy of the leave rules and procedures for the Prime Minister of the country through an RTI application from the Prime Minister's Office and Cabinet Secretariat

 jammu-kashmir ko lekar narendra modi sarkaar ne bada faisla liya he
 Home Minister Amit Shah presented the government's resolution letter for Jammu and Kashmir in the Rajya Sabha
 shah ne kaha ki kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene vaale anuchhed 370 ke praavdhaan hataa die gaye hai
 Now not all of its clauses will apply
 shah ne rajyasabha main kashmir ke punargathan kaa prastaav bhi pesh kiya he
 The historic decision of Modi government, paralyzed section-370, separated from Jammu and Kashmir, the Ladakhmodi government has now made Jammu and Kashmir a union territory
 saath hi ladakh ko jammu-kashmir se alag kiya gaya he
 Jammu and Kashmir is divided into 2 parts
 grih mantri amit shah ne rajyasabha main kaha ki jammu-kashmir centre shasit pradesh hoga jahaan vidhansabha ke chunaav honge
 The second Ladakh union territory will be the command of LG
 yani jammu-kashmir ab dilli kii tarah vidhansabha vaala or ladakh, chandigarh kii tarah vidhansabha viheen centreshasit pradesh hoga
 After the decision of the Modi government, not only the rights of Jammu and Kashmir from other states have been reduced but also reduced
 jammu-kashmir kii haalat ab dilli jaise rajya kii tarah ho gai he
 Now elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir and there will be governments, but the intervention of the Lieutenant Governor will increase considerably
 dilli kii tarah jis prakaar sarkaar ko sari manjuuri uparajyapal se leni hoti he, usee prakaar ab jammu-kashmir main bhi hoga
 Article 370 related to Kashmir is permanent or temporary? Know after the decision of the Rayomodi government of the constitution experts, now the Indian Constitution will be fully implemented
 jammu-kashmir kaa ab apana alag se koi samvidhan nahin hoga
 Jammu and Kashmir passed its constitution on 17 November 1956, it is completely over
 kashmir ko abhi tak jo visheshadhikaar mili the, uske tahat immergency nahin lagaai ja sakati he
 But now emergency can be imposed there after the decision of the government
 jaaniye 35A kaa itihaas, aakhir jammu-kashmir main kyon machaa he is par bavaalabata den ki anuchhed 370 ke tahat jammu-kashmir vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal 6 saal kaa tha
 But like the country, here will be a five-year assembly term
 iske alaava jammu-kashmir main vot kaa adhikaar sirf vahaan ke sthaayee nagarikon ko tha
 People from any other state could not vote here and could not be candidates in elections
 ab sarkaar ke faisle ke baad bharat ke naagarik vahaan ke voter or pratyaashee ban sakate hai
 The atmosphere of bitterness and suspicion created by the cancellation of talks between the national security advisors of India and Pakistan last month is yet to be rectified

 After the shameful failure of the UFA agreement to initiate talks, the leaders of India and Pakistan will now be closely watching the entire world at the United Nations
 is baat kii ashanka badhati ja rahi he ki kisi aupchaarik samvaad prakriya ke abhaav or sarhad par lagaataar bad rahe tanaav kii prishthbhumi main bharat ke bheetar ab agar koi or bada aatanki hamalaa hua to yah donon deshon ke bich kahin jang kaa bis na ban jaae
 The question is, should Modi and Sharif meet in New York? Yes, of course we should meet
 kisi bhi paksh ko aisi mulaakaat ko apni haar ke rup main nahin dekhnaa chahie
 Face-to-face dialogue, however brief it is, always serves to reduce tensions and also reinforces the Indian side that only bilateral dialogue can resolve differences between the two countries
 bharat ne kisi tisare paksh yaa bahupaksheeya hastkshep ko hameshaa se nakaara he lekin modi or sharif ne kai maukon par is baat se sahmati jataai he ki jang kisi cheez kaa samaadhaan nahin ho sakati, phir chaahe vah khulkar ladi jaae yaa chhipakar, choti ho yaa badi
 Even if there is a limited dialogue, the question arises how to convert it into a meaningful process and sustain it so that it does not change into a verbal war
 isi hafte lahore main locarpit pakistan ke purv videsh mantri khurshid mahmud kasuri kii likhi kitaab nidar e hoque nor e dav donon deshon ke bich 2005 se 2008 ke bich parade ke peeche chale samvaad kaa pehali baar vistrut varnan karti he
 Looking at this, it makes sense that this process provides a way for both countries and creates hope that the two can engage with each other even in a situation of mutual benefit
 pustak ke mutabik, vaarta kii pragati ko saarvajanik kiye bagaiyr or media kii chamak-damak se dur rahete hue donon deshon ke vaartakar—bharat se satinder ke
 Lamba and Tariq Aziz from Pakistan came very close to an agreement on the Kashmir dispute
 ajij naukarshah the jo tatkaaleen raashtrapati parvej musharraf ke vishwaasapaatr the or neshnal security council ke secretary the
 Former Ambassador Lamba was appointed as negotiator by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 us samay hui vaarta kaa motaa khaakaa to saarvajanik he hi lekin kasuri ne pehali baar is kitaab main bataaya he ki pakistan ne kaise is baatcheet ko sambhala or vivaad ke masalon ko sulajhane kii ore kaam kiya
 Kasuri writes that Aziz met Lamba quietly dozens of times in places like Dubai, Kathmandu and Bangkok
 desh vaapasi ke baad musharraf ke rawalpindi sthit awaas par bulaai ek baithak main ajij in mulakaaton main hui baatcheet kaa khaakaa pesh karte
 These meetings were attended by Musharraf himself, Kasuri, the head of the ISI (ashfaq Kayani, who became the army chief after Musharraf), the Foreign Secretary and the President's Chief of Staff
 in baithkon main ajij ke masaude main badlaav karke unhen kuch masalon kaa ek masauda thamaya jaataa, jin par unhen lamba se agali baar baat kerani hoti thi
 Lamba does not say anything about the process and outcome of the behind-the-scenes negotiations, of which he himself was a part
 unhone india today ko bataaya, ''aapako samajhnaa chahie ki mere liye parade ke peeche liye gaye faislon par tippanee karnaa yaa samjhaute ke masaude par baat karnaa upyukt nahin hoga
 The papers related to back-channel negotiations are the property of the government
 inhen purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne maujuuda pradhanmantri modi ko saunp diya he
 "the papers related to the behind-the-scenes talk handed over to Modi by Manmohan Singh include a detailed record of 150 hours of dialogue which can be in thousands of pages
" is baatcheet ke chute sire ko agar pakad liya jaae to modi ke liye yah bahut upyogi sabit ho saktaa he
 One of the reasons for such progress in this conversation was that the two countries decided to focus only on terror and Kashmir's 'value issues' rather than delve into other pending issues like Siachen, Sir Creek and bilateral trade
 isamen ek kaarak yah bhi tha ki musharraf us vakt raashtrapati hone ke alaava sena pramukh bhi the or iesai bhi puri tarah unke saath thi, lihaaja sainya-naagarik uddeshyon kii ekarupata kii yah durlabh sthiti thi
 Lamba confirms this, "I got the back-of-the-scenes conversation confirming the support of the Pakistani military directly from its top level
" '' ahm baat yah he ki is baatcheet ke dauraan pakistan ne kisi janamat sangrah yaa tisare paksh ke hastkshep se sambandhit apni maang ke liye dabaav nahin banaaya
 Both sides also agreed that the borders would not be redrawn and that any future agreement would determine that the loc was the real frontier between the two countries
 kasuri kitaab main khulaasa karte hai ki donon paksh chaar ahm kshetron main samjhaute par pahunch gaye the
 Army withdraws from Kashmir: Pakistan insisted on removing the army from the valley, which was the demand of many separatist groups of Kashmir at that time
 kasuri kehete hai ki bharat tab jawaab main ek prastaav lekar aayaa tha ki pakistan jab tak apane kabje vaale kashmir se (uttari ilaakon samet) apni sainya tukdiiyon ko nahin hataa legaa, tab tak vah uske prastaav ko sweekaar nahin kar saktaa
 After the talks on both sides, it was decided that both sides would agree to reduce their forces gradually but largely from populated areas, which would be decided according to the ground situation
 '' lamba is ahm riyaayat kii pushti bhi nahin karte hai or ise khaarij bhi nahin karte hai, lekin srinagar main may 2014 main hue ek seminar main sanyabalon main katautee samet tamaam samaadhaanon par charchaa karte hue unhone is baat kii ore ishaara kiya tha, ''sanyabalon main katautee kii anivaary purv shart yah he ki katutaa, hinsa or aatankwaad kaa pehle khaatmaa ho
 "restraint on Terrorism: Kasuri accepts that curbing cross-border terrorism was a precondition and he writes," We had already accepted that the matter of moving the peace process with India away , It will not be sustainable until movement across the loc is controlled
 '' unka daawa he ki pakistan kii ore se ek bada kaarykram shuru kiya gaya tha, taaki aatankwaadiyon main kattarta ko khatm kiya jaae, unhen unki maujuuda gatividhiyon se kaata jaae or samaaj kaa 'upyogi' sadsy banane ke uddeshy se unka punarvaas kiya jaae
 As an evidence of this, Kasuri states that during that period the Indian army itself had said that the infiltration from the loc has 'reduced to zero'
 ' bhartiya sanyabalon kaa haalanki maananaa he ki aisa uski aatank-virdohi gatividhiyon ke chalate hua tha, na ki pakistan kii kisi karrwai ke kaaran, lekin yah tathy ab bhi sahi he ki us dauraan elosi par sangharsh viraam ke ulanghan kii ghatnaayen kam hui thim or vaarta ke dauraan sarhad par apekshaakrit shanti thi
 self-governance: One of the most controversial issues was Pakistan's demand for self-government in Kashmir, which India has always seen as a conspiracy to weaken Delhi's hold on the Valley
 back-channel vaartaon ke dauraan kasuri bataate hai ki bharat kaa jor is baat par tha ki pakistan bhi aisa hi kuch apane kabje vaale kashmir ke bheetar kare, jisamen gilgit or baltistan ke uttari ilaake bhi shaamil hon
 Pakistan was reluctant on this proposal as it had separated the two regions from each other in a very planned manner during the past years
 uttari ilaake ranneetik rup se uske liye kamjor sabit hote, kyonki ve china ke jinsiyang se lagate the
 Despite this he accepted this fact
 swashaasan ke masale par lamba tippanee karne se inkaar karte hai lekin yah baat saamne aati he ki bharat agar aisa karne ko taiyaar hua bhi tha, to uskaa bhartiya samvidhan ke kisi bhi praavdhaan se kahin koi takaraav nahin tha
 Joint System: One such controversial issue was the joint system which Kasuri describes as part of the dialogue, "through which Kashmiris on both sides could cooperate in specific areas of common interest and where Indians and Pakistanis were present in some form or the other
" '' musharraf is prakriya ko lekar utsahit the or ise ghati par bharat sarkaar kii pakad ko dhire-dhire dhilaa karne kii ek or sajeesh ke rup main dekha gaya
 Lamba does not say anything on this issue, but it is clear from his address in Srinagar that while India agreed to consider this system, it had to be only as a consultative unit whose work was tourism, travel, pilgrimage, The socio-economic issues such as trade, health and education were to be monitored
