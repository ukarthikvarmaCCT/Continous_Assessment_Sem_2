 ’ The government led by Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa has proved a majority in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly
 sadan kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi ayogy tehraae gaye vidhayakon ne lobby main aakar khub hangaamaa kiya
 It was easy for Yeddyurappa to prove his majority after the Speaker of the Assembly declared 16 mlas disqualified
 is nirnaayak ghadi se thik pehle vidhansabha adhyaksh ne 16 vidhayakon ko ayogy tehra diya tha
 Of these, 11 are from BJP, while 5 are independents
 isse pehle karnataka main sarkaar ke shakti pareekshan se pehle sanvaidhanik jang chhid gai thi
 The reason for the ruckus was a letter from the Governor HR Bhardwaj
 chitthee main rajyapal ne vidhansabha adhyaksh bopaiya ko baagi vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd karne se baj aane ko kaha tha
 He wrote that canceling the membership of legislators would be tampering with the democratic process

 Between the last date of voting on May 19 and the date of counting on May 23, you will see dozens of post-poll surveys or exit polls
 lekin aap dekhne ke liye taiyaar rahen janaa-parkhaa or bharosemand india today- exis maai india chunaav uparaant surveykshan
 Know why? Out of all the elections held in the country between 2013 and 2018, 95% of the India today-axis My India post-poll surveys have managed to make correct estimates
 2013 se exis maai india ne 36 chunaav uparaant surveykshan kiye hai jinamein se 34 main jeetne vaali party / gathbandhan kaa sateek anumaan saamne aayaa
 This time India today-axis My India is coming out with more preparations for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 ye chunaav uprath surveykshan 19 may kii shaam ko india today tivi or aaj tak par dikhaaya jayega
 In this survey, 8 lakh voters took part in 542 Lok Sabha constituencies

 Pradeep Gupta, director of Axis My India, describes how he has been successful in conducting accurate surveys for a long time
 gupta ne india today ko bataaya, “safalataa kii dar (saxes rate) kaa aadhaar ye he ki ham har kshetra se behatar numaaindgi vaale namoonay lete hai
 More than 500 well-trained volunteers at the ground level are selected after undergoing a rigorous recruitment process
 iske alaava mobile management se walantirs kii live trekking or din pratidin ke hisaab se random semple testing kii jaati he jo pole study ko adhik vishwasaneey or bharosemend banaati he
 "after the data quality is cleared, analysts at the higher levels scrutinize the data
 isi prakriya main pradeep gupta khud ubhar rahe trends ko dicode karte hai
 History of Accurate Estimates India Today has joined hands with Axis My India since the 2015 Bihar elections
 isse pehle bhi exis maai india kaa sateek anumaan lagane kaa badhiya record rahaa he
 In 20132013, Axis My India conducted post poll surveys in four assembly elections and their estimates were proved in all four
 exis maai india ne anumaan lagaaya ki bijepi madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main sarkaar banaaegi or ye anumaan sahi sabit hua
 It was also speculated that a hung assembly would come to the fore in Delhi and the actual results were the same
 tab pehali baar chunaav main utari aam aadmi party ke liye exis maai india post pole ne 27 seat milane kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 In reality the Aam Aadmi Party got 28 seats
 aisi party jiskaa pehle koi chunaav itihaas nahin rahaa, uske bare main sateek anumaan lagaana vaaki badi baat tha
 The 2014 Axis My India had predicted for the 2014 Lok Sabha election that the NDA would form the government at the Center with an absolute majority and a similar result came to light
 loksabhaa chunaav nateezon kaa sahi anumaan lagane ke saath hi 2014 main chaar rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye bhi safalataa kii yahi kahani doharaai gaiexis maai india ne jharkhand, maharashtra or haryana main bijepi, or jammu-kashmir main pidipi ke sabase badi party ke taur par ubharne kaa anumaan lagaaya or vaise hi nattejey saamne aae
 In 20152015, Axis My India conducted two post poll surveys for Delhi and Bihar
 dilli ke liye survey main anumaan lagaaya gaya tha ki aam aadmi party ko purna bahumat milegaa, aisa hi hua
 Axis My India had projected the JDU to form the government in Bihar, which also proved to be correct
 2016india tude-exis maai india ne chaar rajyon or ek centre shasit pradesh ke liye post-pole survey kiye
 Four of these proved to be accurate
 assam main bijepi, kerala main ldf, pudducheri main congress-diemke gathbandhan or pashchim bengal main trinmul congress ke agrani rahane kaa anumaan lagaaya jo sahi sabit hua
 The 2017 india-today-axis My India conducted post-poll surveys for 7 states which all proved to be correct
 survey main anumaan lagaaya gaya tha ki uttar pradesh or uttarakhand main bijepi sabase badi party ke taur par ubharegi
 In actual results, BJP won a big victory in both the states
 gujarat or himachal pradesh ke liye bijepi ko bahumat milane kaa anumaan sahi sabit hua
 In our survey for Punjab and Manipur, the Congress was projected to be the leading party, which also proved to be correct
 manipur main congress sabase badi party rahi lekin bahumat se dur rah gai
 This was also indicated in our post poll survey
 asal main manipur main bijepi chunaav uparaant gathbandhan kii madad se sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahi
 The hung assembly was estimated in our post poll survey for Goa
 ye anumaan bhi sahi niklaa
 Like in Manipur, in Goa, the BJP managed to form a government through post-poll alliance
 in rajyon ke alaava dilli, mumbai, pune, thane or nagpur ke nikaay chunaavon main bhi hamaare post pole survey ke anumaan sahi sabit hue
 Our post poll survey estimates for the 6 state assembly elections in 20182018 turned out to be correct
 hamaare post pole survey main meghalaya main congress ke sabase badi party lekin trishanku vidhansabha kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha jo sahi sabit hua
 The BJP, which won just two seats in Meghalaya, joined hands with regional parties like NPF and UDP to form the government
 vahiin, congress or iske sahyogiyon ne jahaan rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main sarkaar banaain
 At the same time, MNF in Mizoram and TRS in Telangana won
 aise hi anumaan india today-exis maai india ne survey main vyakt kiye the
 In just two of all the 36 post poll surveys, our estimates in Tamil Nadu in 2016 and Karnataka in 2018 did not go well

 We have also said in the past that we are all with the Congress President and take responsibility for the 2019 defeat
 hamaara yah maananaa he ki maujuuda halaat main sirf rahul ji hi party kaa netritv kar sakate he
 His commitment to the welfare of the country and the countrymen is beyond question and unmatched
 ashok gahalot ne kaha ki 2019 ke chunaav kaa nateeja congress ke kaarykram, niti or vichaardhaara kii haar nahin thi
 It is unfortunate that despite the failure of the Modi government on many fronts, the BJP hid its failure behind militancy-nationalism with the help of government machinery
 unhone kaha ki congress adhyaksh ne is chunaav ko mudda aadhaarit banaae rakhane ke liye apana sarvshereshth prayaas kiya
 It is worth mentioning that after the bitter defeat of the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi offered resignation from the post of President in the meeting of the party working committee on 25 May
 haalanki kaary samiti ke sadasyon ne unki peshkash ko khaarij karte hue unhen amulchul badlaav ke liye adhikrut kiya tha

 haalanki party ke kai varisht netaaon ne unase aagrah kiya he ki vah congress kaa netritv karte rahen
 Please tell that before the meeting with Rahul Gandhi, Ashok Gehlot also tweeted a tweet

 He wrote that despite the failure of the Modi government on various fronts including the economy, the BJP hid its huge failures behind its staunch nationalism
 tamaam baadhaon ke baavjood congress adhyaksh ne chunaav ko mudda aadhaarit banane kii puri koshish kii or bhaajapa kaa saamana kiya
 In another tweet, Ashok Gehlot wrote that the Chief Minister of all Congress ruled states will meet Rahul Gandhi at his residence today and show solidarity towards him
 isse purv bhi hamane yah dikhaaya he ki ham congress adhyaksh ke saath hai or ham loksabhaa 2019 kii haar kii jimmedaari lete hai
 (from input language) bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha he ki argedy party lalu prasad yadav kii nijee sampatti he isliye wo har saal rashtriya adhyaksh kaa chunaav karvaa sakate hai
 He said that it is not known what provision is there in the rjd's constitution, but after the election in 2016, the election of president is going on in 2017 as well
 yah unki party kaa maamla he lekin chunaav karaane kaa ek hi makasad he wo he khabaron main bane rahanaa
 The day the nomination comes, then the result will come, during this time many times the news will be made and then the president will become the same

 Nitish Kumar said that we have also told our spokespersons to say anything, but we will not answer

 Nitish Kumar said that Laloo Prasad does not take Yadav's words seriously, they have no effect
 pichley chunaav main unako siten mil gayi, ab chunaav hone dijie wo bank tu pavilion jaaenge
 Nitish Kumar said that no one has asked till today how much they implement what they announce? If there is a debate on the issue, we are willing to participate in that debate, but the person who has nothing to do with the issue personally uses abusive language

 Nitish Kumar said that when Lalu was raided, everyone wanted to know what decision we take on the issue of corruption
 hamane nirnay liya ortejasvi yadavane istipha nahin diya
 And now remains the poster boy
 lalu prasad yadav kaa parivaar van ve trephic he unako chaatr jivan se pataa he ki unhen kaise chapa jaae

 com / 6q4d43uo0d— Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi)october 21, 2019india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne apni padtaal main paaya ki rahul gandhi ne jo video clip share kii he, use is dhang se sampadit kiya gaya he ki virk ne jo bhi kaha, uskaa matlab badal gaya
 What is the video that Davarahul Gandhi has shared is of 39 seconds, in which Baksheesh Singh can be seen addressing Punjabi in a general assembly
 unhen kehete hue suna ja saktaa he, "aap jahaan bhi vot denge, hamen pataa chal jayega
 Do not think that we will not know
 ham jaanboojhkar aapako nahin bataate hai
 But if anyone asks, we can tell who has voted
 kyonki modi ji or manohar laal ji bahut tej hai
 After 22 seconds, a jump cut occurs in the video, which makes it understandable that there is no continuity in the video
 isse baad bakhshish singh kehete hai ki “aap jise chahen use vot den, lekin yah jayega sirf phool (BJP) ko
 a part has been fitted in the machine
 ”samachar agency pitiai ke mutabik, yah video matdaan ke ek din pehle (20 oktober) viral hua
 Taking cognizance of this matter, the Election Commission has issued Baksheesh Singh Konotis for the statement of tampering in evms

 Whatever button you press, the vote will go to the BJP
 iviem main koi poorja feet kar diya gaya he
 "however, it is worth noting that by editing this video, some words have been removed from the statement related to EVM, but some things about Virk's viral statement are also present in the original video
 virk ne vastav main yah baat kahi thi ki aap jise bhi vot denge, yah baat hamen pataa chal jaaegi
 It is now up to the Election Commission to decide whether Virk's statement will fall under the category of unfairly influencing voters or whether it is a violation of the Model Code of Conduct

 adampur main bijepi ko purv siem bhajan laal ke garh main unke bete kuldeep bishnoi ke haathon karaari haar mili thi

 gadhi saanpala kiloi main bijepi ne is baar dharmbir hooda kii jagahinelo se aae satish nandalpar daanv khelaa he
 Shashiranjan Parmar in place of Gunpal in Tosham, Meena Narwal in place of Kuldeep Kakran in Kharkhoda, Yogeshwar Dutt in place of Baljit Singh Malik in Baroda, Parmindra Singh Dhul from INLD in place of Sanjeev in Julana in Jind and Akali Dal in place of Rajendra Singh in Kalanwali Has fielded MLA Balkaur Singh

 i have learnt a new skill now and im really proud of myself! Ive always been fascinated by fire dancing i just never had the courage to do it myself! But as an artist its always important to push yourself and find ways to work under pressure regardless of the circumstances! Never say i CANT always say i Will

 Former President Pranab Mukherjee has said that Congress President Sonia Gandhi was upset over his meeting with the late Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray before the 2012 presidential election
 unhone mukherjee ko is prakaar kii mulaakaat naa karne kii salaah di thi
 Mukherjee has revealed this in his book 'the Coalition Years'
 unhone kaha ki vah thakare se rakanpa netaa sharad pavaar kii salaah par mili the
 The NCP was in the government in the second term of the Congress-led UPA
 jab bal thakare se milane pahunche the pranabpurv raashtrapati ne kaha kichunaav abhiyaan ke silsile main vah 13 july 2012 ko mumbai gayi the
 The Shiv Sena supported Mukherjee's candidature despite being a constituent of the bjp-led NDA
 iske baad vah shivasena ke sansthaapak se milane gayi the
 Mukherjee said in his book, 'I decided to meet Thackeray despite Sonia's disapproval because i felt that the person who left his traditional coalition partner to support my candidature should not be let down by feeling humiliated 
 ’ pranab ne bataaya ki unhone sonia or pavaar donon se yah poocha tha ki kya unhen apni mumbai yatra main thakare se milanaa chahie yaa nahin
 Pawar also had some influence behind Thackeray supporting Mukherjee
 sonia ne jataai thi nakhusheepavaar kii salaah sonia se bilkul alag thi or unhone is baat par jor diya ki mukherjee ko thakare se milanaa chahie
 Pawar said that if Mukherjee does not meet him during his visit to Mumbai, then Thackeray will take him as his personal insult
 unhone likhaa, ‘sonia mere bal thakare se milane ko lekar utsuk nahin thi or unhone mujhe sambhav hone par isse parhez ke liye kaha tha
 Sonia Gandhi's objections to Thackeray were based on his own conception of his policies
 ’ mukherjee ne kaha ki dilli lautne par congress netaa girija vyas unase mili thim or unhen bataaya tha ki sonia evam raajnneetik sachiv ahamed patel thakare ke saath unki baithak ko lekar khush nahin hai
 He took note of Sharad Pawar's advice
 He wrote, 'I returned to Delhi and the next morning Girija Vyas met me
 unhone mujhe suchit kiya ki thakare ke saath meri mulaakaat ko lekar sonia gandhi evam ahamed patel khinn hai
 i understand the reason for his unhappiness, but as i said i did what i thought was right
 mujhe sharad pavaar, jo ki samprag dwitiya ke ek mahatvapurn ghatak the, dwaara di gayi salaah kii samvedansheeltaa ko dhyaan main rakhana tha
 'he said,' Without the effective intervention and support of his colleagues, it would not be possible for him (UPA) to complete his term
 yah pehle se hi gyaat tha ki sharad pavaar vibhinn muddon par pehle hi aprasann the or anya gathbandhan bhagidaaron ke bich bhi sambandhon main tanaav tha
 i did not want to give them further reason for unhappiness
 ’mukherjee nelikha, "unhone (pavaar ne) majaak main kaha ki ‘maratha tiger’ ke liye ‘royal bengal tiger’ kaa samarthan karnaa swaabhaavik hi he

 Sharad Pawar met the Congress President today and briefed her on the situation in Maharashtra
 It was decided that in a day or two, representatives from NCP & Congress will meet in Delhi to discuss the way forward
 Earlier today, Sharad Pawar answered a question before meeting Sonia Gandhi Which many people were surprised to hear
 unase poocha gaya ki shivasena kah rahi he ki vah sarkaar banane ke liye ensipi se baatcheet kar rahi thi
 To this Pawar said, 'was that really so?' Let me tell you that Sonia Gandhi was ideologically wary of any alliance with the Shiv Sena
 kyonki shivasena, bijepi kii sahyogi party thi
 But she agreed to negotiate with the idea in Maharashtra that it would succeed in keeping the BJP out of power

 com / 55g1cjxple The Supreme Court is ready to hear the Congress petition on the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat
 is maamle par buudhvaar ko sunwaayee hogi
 Leader of the Gujarat Congress, Opposition Pareshbhai Dhanani, has filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Election Commission notification issued for the two seats
 unke dwaara amit shah or smriti irani dwaara khaali kii gai siton par ek saath chunaav karaane kii maang kii gai he
 The petition said that holding separate elections on both the seats on the same day is unconstitutional and against the spirit of the Constitution
 gujarat se rajyasabha main khaali hui do siton par bhi 5 july ko chunaav honge
 Darsial, according to the Election Commission notification, Amit Shah got the certificate of winning the Lok Sabha elections on May 23, while Smriti Irani got it on May 24
 isse donon ke chunaav main ek din kaa antar ho gaya
 On this basis, the Commission has considered the two seats of the state separately, but elections will be held on the same day
 aisa hone se ab donon siton par bijepi ko jeet mil jaaegi
 Because, there the first preference votes will be decided afresh
 lekin ek saath chunaav hote to congress ko ek seat mil jaati
 The candidate needs 61 votes to win the Rajya Sabha election in Gujarat by number strength
 ek hi bailat par chunaav se ummidavaar ek hi vot daal paaegaa
 In this situation, the Congress could easily take a seat as it has 71 mlas
 lekin chunaav ayog ke notification ke mutabik, vidhayak alag-alag vot karenge
 In such a situation, they will get a chance to vote twice
 is tarah bijepi ke vidhayak jinaki sankhya 100 se zyada he ve do baar vot karke donon ummidavaaron ko jitwa sakate hai

 On this, Gadkari quipped that this is the culture of the Congress
 yahaan sonia ke ird gird sab chal rahaa he
 But the good thing is that Congress is talking about change
 gadakari bole ki ladaai vichaar bhinnata kii nahin, vichaar shoonyata kii he
 Gadkari said that a fight of ideas is good for democracy
 unhone kaha ki hamaare apane vichaar hai
 We stand by them
 magar kai baar hamaare vichaaron ke ulat chhavi banane kii koshish kii jaati he
 Attacking Congress and SP-RJD, Gadkari said how can those who do politics of one party or religion be secular

 During this, Gadkari called the conduct of Congress leaders biased after the hanging of Afzal Guru and the Batla House encounter
 jairam ramesh ne gadakari ke is turm 'multi communal' kii khinchaai kii
 He said that i am thinking the definition of 'multi communal' because if there is a multi communal, then it will be secular

 Mukherjee said that is your friend? So i said BJP has a loss of 20-25 lakhs
 jis din kingfisher kii flite cancel hoti he, jet vaale rate badha dete hai, to masalaa ye he ki sarkaar kii niyat sahi ho, to salaah di jaae
 They should be told how important it is to maintain the atmosphere of competition in the private sector
 gadakari ne kaha ki congress ne industry kaa maahaul khatm kar diya he
 On this Jairam Ramesh said that media should be kept out in the process
 asli gunahagaar media he
 Giving the example of land acquisition issue, Ramesh said that we just took care to keep media out in every meeting
 kaam ho gaya, aapke saamne he
 On this, Gadkari said that if the country is in the interest then we will support the ruling party
 kisi siyasat kar rahe hai rahul gandhi?aaj tak ne poocha sawaal ki rahul gandhi ek aisi raajnneeti shuru karnaa chaahate hai, jise party kaa strecchar sambhaal nahin paata
 What is the problem? is par jairam ramesh bole ki main unka pravaktaa to nahin, par saath kaam kar chukaa hum, to kuch kah saktaa hum
 Ramesh said that it is not easy to bring change in the 125-year-old Congress
 rahul gandhi chaahate hai ki raajnneeti main samaaj ke har varg kii hissedaar ho
 Few families are not occupied
 ramesh ne kaha ki ye auron kaa vichaar bhi ho saktaa he
 But Rahul Gandhi put it in front as a leader
 ramesh kii baat katate hue gadakari bole ki isiilie to hamane ek chaiwale ko sheersh pad kaa daavedaar banaaya
 Ramesh said that in politics there has been a consensus of sitting getting, which is the right of possession
 sitting ko get out bhi kahana chahie kabhi
 Gadkari agreed to this suggestion
 ramesh bole ki rahul gandhi kii soch 'main' par kendrit nahin he
 According to 'I am he' he does not think
 is par punya prasoon vaajapeyi ne hastkshep karte hue kaha ki rahul se zyada 'main' kahaan he
 In speech I, my mother, my father, i cried as if the jumle remain
 mujhe galat laga to vidheyak faad diya
 On this Ramesh said that it is right that he rose above this order
 magar ab vah badlaav laa rahe hai
 He may not be a minister, but is in public life and is showing it by working
 ramesh ne rahul se judaa ek kissa bhi sunaaya
 He said that the Congress has not been in power in UP for 24 years
 hamane vahaan ek lakh mahila samooh banaakar bainkon se joda
 There was no incentive from the state government
 magar rahul gandhi ne iske bina upi main kuch karne kaa sochaa or kiya
 You discuss what did
 ye kiya
 Ramesh said that it is wonderful to gather one million women into one lakh savings group without the support of administration
 yuvaaon se kaise jud rahe hai aap log?gadakari ne ye sawaal sunate hi bolaa congress par hamalaa
 Said this is a mother-son party
 bole ki kehane kii baat he ki aam aadmi aae
 So start with Rahul Gandhi himself
 unki ekmaatr kaabiliyat he ki ve rajeev gandhi ke bete hai
 Gadkari said that the workers in our party come and ask me why they gave him a ticket
 sab sunakar main bas itnaa poochta hum kya congress main aap sonia gandhi ke yahaan jaakar yah sawaal puch sakate hai
 Can enter inside
 gadakari bole ki ye congress main hi hota he ki pradhanmantri ke pet se pradhanmantri paidaa ho
 On this statement, Ramesh said that i do not want Tokatoki, but Gadkari became the party president through RSS
 gadakari ne kaha ki ye galat he
 i did not want to come to Delhi
 adhyaksh banane main sangh kaa koi role nahin rahaa
 Gadkari said that i used to paste the poster
 haar daalane yaa airport par jane kii raajnneeti nahin kar paaya
 Gadkari said that i do not wear kurta pajamas
 kai logon ne kaha ki raajnneeti nahin kar paaoge
 He proved to be wrong
 main sabase yuva netaa tha, jo us kursi par baitha adhyaksh kii, jis par atal ji baithe the
 Look at Narendra Modi
 aaj bhi unki maa ek chote se ghar main rahati he
 Gadkari taunted that this is not possible in the Congress
 jairam ramesh hajaar rahul gandhi se zyada hoshiyaar hai
 But they cannot become the head of the party
 is par ramesh hansate hue bole, aap mujhe berozegaar karnaa chaahate hai
 When the atmosphere became serious again, Ramesh said that both the parties would have to come together on important issues of the country
 hamane aath saal main ye maukey kai baar khoe hai
 On this, Gadkari said that a lot is said in politics
 lekin ham india vijan 2020 par kaam kar rahe hai
 We met many people, to know what the future country should be like
 main chahta hum ki jairam ramesh jaise jo achche mantri hai
 Come visit us sometime and discuss with us off the record
 to inhen bhi lagu karne main aasaani rahegi
 But sadly i was president of the opposition party for three years, but he did not communicate even once
 ye bill aane ke pehle sansad main charchaa karte hai
 Gadkari said that if there is no dialogue, there will be a dispute and it will harm the country
 gadakari bole ki ramesh ne sahi kaha ki media chaahati hi ki nahin ki ekta ho
 But this is your business
 aap kariye
 But let us also show understanding
 kya jairam ramesh jaise mantriyon ke liye gunjaaish nahin he is system main?is sawaal par ramesh bole ki ki nabbe ke dashak se kai baar dekha gaya he ki adaalaton jaisi sansthaaon ne lakshmana rekha paar kii he
 CBI and CVC and CAG are crossing the line
 aaj hamaari sarkaar he, kal ko inaki ho sakati he
 Ramesh said that this will hurt everyone
 adaalaton ne faisla liya ki ham nirnay lenge, sarkaron ko aadesh denge
 The decision has become dangerous due to the three CBI, CVC and the court
 gadakari bole ki main ramesh kii baat se sahamat hum
 Dignity should not be exceeded
 hamaari cabinet or pradhanmantri supreme hai
 The four limbs should work in moderation
 nyaaypalika kanoon kii vyakhya kar sakati he
 But to what extent is the judgment of the Supreme Court justified on the issue of parking in Delhi
 sibiai kaa kodaa koun fatkaar rahaa?gadakari bole ki khud sarkaar ne ye naubat paidaa kar di he
 Sometimes Lalu, sometimes Mulayam is reprimanded
 is par ramash bole ki choda to pradhanmantri ko bhi nahin he
 Gadkari said that everyone should remain in the jurisdiction
 aakhri main sawaal aayaa audiyans kii taraf se
 He said that Sonia and Rahul Gandhi's name comes as soon as the Congress thinks, while in the BJP, many names including Vajpayee ji, Advani ji come up
 aisa kyon
 On this Ramesh said that yes it is true that only two names are in the media
 magar party main kai saadhaaran prishthbhumi se aae netaa hai, jo bahut acha kaam kar rahe hai
 Intervening, Gadkari said that his party's vice-president is so strong that the pm's bill tears
 sarkaar wyk he, parivaar majboot he
 Gadkari said that there is democracy in BJP, so there is 7-8 Ta
 ramesh ne tanj ksaa ki aap sab to sabsidari hai, holding party to nagpur main baithi aresas he
 On the provocation of Gadkari, Ramesh said that i have opposed Rahul and Sonia Gandhi many times
 ramesh ne poocha ki agar bijepi ye kahati he ki sangh kaa prabhaav nahin he to ye hakeekat se hatane sa he
 Gadkari said that the Sangh is a part of life, not our politics
 bihar ke mujffarpur ke maniyari thana ke raghunathpur madhuban gaanv kii panchayat main ek garib parivaar ko apni beti ke saath hui chhedchhad kaa virodh karnaa mahangaa pad gaya
 In the Bhari Panchayat, a Tughlaki decree was issued not only to prosecute the victim's family but they were also beaten fiercely
 darasal raghunathpur madhuban gaanv kii rahane vaali gita devi kii beti chanda ke saath gaanv ke kuch dabangon ne chhedchhad kii thi
 These bullies made it difficult for Geeta Devi and her family to live in the village
 gita devi kii beti chanda kaa ghar se niklaa mushkil ho gaya tha
 Some of the overbearing instincts of the village used to do irresponsibility and raids with equal funds and this family was upset
 thak-harkar gita devi ne is pareshaani se nijaat paane or dabangon kii karatuut kii shikaayat karne ke liye maniyari thane kaa darwaja khatkhataya lekin kanoon ke raaj main vahaan gita kii shikaayat sunne ko koi police adhikari taiyaar nahin the
 Another face of 'bihar Police, always with you' was revealed once again
 police ke ravaiye se pareshaan gita devi apni beti ke saath thane se khaali haath laut gai
 Geeta Devi did not accept the decision of the Panchayat, Devi finally took refuge in Muzaffarpur Court
 court main gita devi ne gaanv ke in dabangon ke khilaaf pariwaad patr daayar kiya
 Then what was the matter of filing a libel letter in the court, these domineering felt exasperating
 iske baad in dabangon ne hi khud gaanv main panchayat bulaai or panchayat main gita devi or uski beti ko bhi aane kaa farmaan jari kiya
 The panchayat ruled that the suit filed in the court be withdrawn
 gita devi ne panchayat ke faisle ko maanane se kar diya
 The Dabangs felt this worse and what happened then was a lesson to those who cried about the rule of law
 jamkar kii gai pityeepanchayat ke saamne hi in dabangon ne gita devi or uski beti kii jamkar pitayee kii
 Due to brutal beating, Geeta Devi broke her hands and is undergoing treatment at Sadar Hospital
 is maamle kii jaankaree police mahakme ke varisht adhikariyon ko hui
 Muzaffarpur SSP Vivek Kumar took the matter seriously and gave the responsibility of investigating the entire incident to the DSP of Muzaffarpur
 saath hi jaanch puri hone ke baad aropiyon par karrwai karne kaa bhi nirdesh jari kiya he
 The difficulties of the Aam Aadmi Party started from Punjab are increasing continuously
 ab dilli ke bijwasan se vidhayak karnal devendra saharaavat ne aam aadmi party ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal ko chitthee likhakar apni hi party ke senior netaaon par bade gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 The leaders have been accused of sexually abusing them for giving tickets in Punjab
 in netaaon main durgesh pathak or sanjay singh bhi shaamil hai, jabaki dilip pandey par dilli ke vidhayakon ke kaamkaaj main dakhal dene kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 According to the letter dear Arvind Kejriwal, i want to bring to your attention these 4 issues
 1-mujhe party ke hi kuch violentirs ne punjab main tikat vitaran ke dauraan hue yon shoshan ke kuch maamalon ke bare main bataaya he
 i met many people in Punjab and tried to know the ground reality of these allegations
 muche lagata he ki aap or dilli ke baaki emele is baat se anjaan he ki sanjay singh, durgesh pathak or dilli se baaki party ke riprogentative punjab main kya-kya kar rahe hai
 2-dilip Pandey is also doing something similar in Delhi
 unkeldakiyonke saath photo internet par, soshal cites par circulet ho rahe hai or wo party ke vidhayakon ke ilaakon main bhi bevajaah dakhsandaji kar rahe hai
 3-now the image and position of the party is deteriorating
 party ke galat chhavi ke logon ke khilaaf ab ection lene kaa vakt aa gaya he
 4-the way Ashutosh has argued in front of everyone in the Sandeep Kumar CD scandal case is also against our values
 main aapse anurodh karata hum ki aap kuch aisa karen ki jisase logon ko ye ahsaas ho ki ham abhi bhi politics bhi badlaav laa sakate hai
 Yours faithfully, Colonel Devendra Sehrawat, Aam Aadmi Party MLA, Bijwasan Sahrawat has also sent this letter to Anna Hazare and alleged that the party has deviated from the way Arvind Kejriwal had started the party by asking to change politics
 apane hi vidhayak kii or se lagaae gayi gambhir aaropon par ab tak party ke kisi bhi senior leadership ne koi safai nahin di he
 Akshat Kaushik of Varanasi has secured the third position in the examination conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) for admission to medical and dental colleges across the country, NEET and AIIMS, a prestigious medical institution
 neet kii pariksha kul 720 anko kii hoti he jisamen akshat ko 700 number hasil hue hai
 The meritorious Akshat Kaushik has read the flag of his success in KVPY i
e
 Kishore Scientific Promotion Scheme earlier
 KVPY sanis or research ke kshetra main chaatro ko protsaahit karne ko lekar bharat sarkaar kii taraf se di jane vaali scolership he
 In his conversation with NDTV India, Akshay explains that the questions in Physics, Chemistry and Biology come from all three in the NEET exam, but to achieve success, biology requires the most attention because 50% of the questions in NEET are the same
 Subjects are asked
 akshay kaa kahana he ki agar 360 ank kii biology main agar aap acha score kar lete hai to isse safalataa kii sambhaavnaaen bad jaati hai
 Although chemistry has also been a favorite subject of Akshat, he says that the three parts of chemistry i
e
 organic, physical and inorganic are a separate subject in their own right and students need different approaches for their preparation
 unki raay main in teenon hisson kii taiyaari ke liye aadhaar NCERT ko hi bananaa chahie
 Akshat believes that physics has always been a difficult challenge for students preparing for medical exams although it is a different matter that Akshat has scored 180 out of 180 in Physics
 akshat ke mutabik vishyon ko lekar samay kaa bantwaaraa behad soch samaj kar kiye jane kii jarurat he
 If more time is spent behind one topic, then other subjects become weak
 aamtaur par hota ye he ki physics ke khauf main chaatr apana zyaadaatar samay iske peeche hi kharch kar dete hai
 As far as exam stress is concerned, Akshay believes that touching any tough topic should be avoided just one or two days before the exam, it can help avoid unnecessary psychological pressure and you perform better by pre-tensioning the exam
 can do
 thik aisi hi taiyaari ames ke liye bhi hoti he bas isamen ye samajhnaa chahie ki neet main sabhi prashno ko atemt karnaa chahie par ames main jisame confident hai usee ko karnaa chahie tukka nahin maranaa chahie

 12:03 AM Karnataka: PM Modi will start election campaign from May 1, will address rally ek pita par beti sabalaatkaaraka aarope laga
 The father was tried in the lower court for rape and was sentenced to ten years
 is aarope kaa boj pita sahan nahin kar paaya or uski maut ho gai
 But the new twist in this case came when the case was filed in the Delhi High Court and the accused father was finally acquitted
 is maamle menucch nyaayalayne is baat kaa sangyaan liya ki pita par darj hue rape ke maamle main naa to jaanch sahi se hui or naa hi sunwaayee
 The case was registered on the complaint of the daughter of the person
 nyaayamurti aar ke gaba ne kaha ki pita pehle din se hi maamle main anuchit hone kii baat kahata rahaa or daawa karata rahaa ki kisi ladke ne uski beti ko agava kar liya or use bahakaaya
 Due to which the daughter accused the father of rape
 nichali adaalat ke galat faisle ke chalate nirdosh pita ko das saal tak jail main rahanaa padaa
 The court observed that a wrong approach of the lower court resulted in injustice to the person in the alleged rape of the minor daughter
 yahi nahin, nichali adaalat dwaara vyakti ko doshi tehraye jane or 10 saal jail kii sajaa sunaaye jane ke 17 saal baad yah faisla saamne aayaa he
 The police did not have the nebulous DNA
 
 
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yah maamla janvari 1996 main saamne aayaa tha jab beti ne pita par balaatkaar kii praathmiki darj karai thi
 The girl was found pregnant at that time
 haalanki, jaanch agency or nichali adaalat ne pita kii daleelon par koi dhyaan nahin diya
 The High Court said that the father had asked to match the DNA of the fetus after taking samples of that boy but the police did not listen and the lower court did not order any such investigation
 adaalat ne kaha ki jaanch spasht rup se ekatarfa thi
 At this time, this court can only condemn inaction on behalf of all concerned
 kya lagaaya tha beti ne aarope
 
 
 The girl alleged in her complaint that her father, an electrician in the Army engineering service, raped her for the first time in 1991 when he lived in Udhampur, Jammu and Kashmir
 nichali adaalat main ladki dwaara rakhe gayi tathyon kaa zikr karte hue ucch nyaayalay ne kaha ki ladki par maamle kii jaankaree dene par koi roak nahin thi or jaisaa ki usne kaha ki 1991 main uske saath balaatkaar kaa silsilaa shuru hua to use is bare main uski maa, bhai-bahanon yaa parivaar ke anya kisi bujurg ko bataane se kisi nahin roka tha
 No physical relationships were investigated
 
 
 ucch nyaayalay ne yah bhi kaha ki ladke or ladki ke bich shaareerik sambandhon kii sambhaavna kii bhi gahan jaanch honi chahie thi
 Unfortunately it did not happen
 ucch nyaayalay ne 22 pannon ke faisle main kaha, "pichley tathyon or paristhitiyon ke maddenjar yah adaalat nichali adaalat ke is nishkarsh se sahamat nahin he

 On Monday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal uploaded a video on youtube to issue a statement that he saluted PM Narendra Modi for the surgical strike, as he showed courage and showed willpower for the surgical strike

 That is why they should apologize

 buudhvaar ko hue matdaan ke dauraan kuch tasviren kaid kii gai hai, jisamen rahul gandhi ko iviem mashin ke paas khadey hue dekha ja saktaa he
 Law: No person, even if he is a candidate, cannot go to the EVM machine or the place where people vote during the voting
 haalanki ummidavaar ko matdaan ke dauraan booth dar booth jane, matdaan main lage adhikariyon se baat karne or voter se milane kii anumati hoti he
 They cannot go to the chamber where evms are kept, or people vote
 gauratlab he ki aam aadmi party kii ore se bhi buudhvaar ko rahul gandhi kii kai aisi tasviren soshal site tivetor par daali gai hai, jisamen amethi ke tiloi ilaake main vah alag-alag booth par iviem mashin ko dekhte hue dekhe ja sakate hai

 There he said that Hindi is not our national language
 hindi baaki bhashaaon kii tarah sirf bhashaa he
 Raj Thackeray started his speech with my brothers and sisters among the North Indians

 Truth is bitter, but true
 hindi rashtrabhasha nahin he
 Because the national language was never created
 jaise hindi bhashaa he, vaise tamil, marathi, gujarati bhashaa he
 Thackeray said that the country should understand its constitution and law
 agar aap ek rajya se duusare rajya main jate hai to pehle police thane main jaakar job ke liye certificate lenaa hota he
 He said that i have come here to make it clear that if there is a job in Maharashtra, then the Marathas have the first right on it
 thik usee tarah jaise upi-bihar main naukari hoti to pehla haq vahaan ke rahane vaale logon kaa hota
 On the controversy over not speaking Marathi, Thackeray said that where you go first, you should learn the language of the place
 kya aap videsh main jaakar hindi main baat karte hai
 a person hailing from Bihar was killed in Assam

 People from gujarat-up-bihar were driven away, but the media did not see it

 Till today, no one has forgotten the story of the lead actor becoming a fly in the serial of Sasural Simar
 simer ke kirdaar ko nibhaane vaali actress deepika kakkad kaa is baat ko lekar soshal media kaaphi majaak banaaya gaya tha or ab ek or tivi kaa kirdaar ek chhipakali banane main tabdeel kar diya gaya he
 Yes, Lavanya's character has been transformed into a lizard in the serial Divya Darshan, so that he can kill the show's character Rakshit and kill him
 ek actor ko apane kariyar main kaaphi ajeeb rolls karne padataa hai or agar script or mekars kii demand aisi ho to actors bhi unhen saport karte hai or apana best dene kii koshish karte hai
 Mansi Srivastava, the actress of the serial Divya Darshan, while talking to Spotboy about her character turning into a lizard, said, 'it was very funny for me
 maine is bare main apane ko-star aadvik se suna tha or wo mujhe puure shoot main ched rahe the
 We were told at the time of narration that Mukta Maam can transform anyone into an animal, so don't be surprised if this happens to you
 logon ne pehle saanp or nevale ke kirdaar nibhaae hai, to mujhe chhipakali banane main majaa aa rahaa tha
 Now my character has become completely negative, which is a different thing
 'jab maanasi se poocha gaya ki unhone is kirdaar ke liye taiyaari kaise kii to unhone bataaya, 'ek chhipakali chupane main tej hoti he or apane shikaar ko jaldi pakad leti he, to main in baton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue apane kirdaar ko thik se nibhaane kii koshish kar rahi hum
 If i watch serials like Naagin, then i am trying to learn how actors flick their eyes, what their body language is and how they speak dialogues

 He said, 'I like his attitude towards the game

 It is great to see him when he plays with great passion

 The news says that Veer Kamal is a defender and shooter
 khabar main vir ke hawaale se kaha gaya he, 'iskaa matlab he ki mujhamen vishwaas jataana unke liye kaaphi phydemand sabit hua he
 Because if they do not do this then they will not be able to recover from the crisis

 ' By becoming the 'sardar' of Gujarat for the third time in a row, Narendra Damodardas Modi once again proved that he is ahead of his rivals not only in talk but also in getting votes
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main bhartiya janata party ko lagbhag do tihaai seat par jeet dilaakar modi jyoti basu, shila dikshit or tarun gogai jaise mukhyamantriyon ke lig main shaamil ho gaye hai jinhone 3 yaa zyada baar apane-apane rajya kii kaman sanbhali
 Modi's victory has changed the political equation of central power in the wake of more BJP than Gujarat and 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 chunaav se pehle aise mana ja rahaa tha ki pradhanmantri pad ke liye modi ko apni daavedaari pesh karne ke liye bady jeet kii darkaar hogi
 And if this happens, the demand to make him the face of the party will intensify even within the party
 jiske sanket abhi se hi milane lage hai
 What does Narendra Modi's victory mean? party ke andar badhegaa rutabagujrat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par chauthi pari shuru karne vaale narendra modi kii party ke andar paith pehle se majboot rahi he
 However, there were many occasions when a voice was raised against him
 par is jeet ne unke rutabe ko ek nayaa aayam de diya he
 Or simply saying that it will be even more difficult to avoid Modi's demand inside the party
 2
 The claim of PM position and the strong December 20 morning As the results of Gujarat started coming, many BJP leaders made a gesture to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections under Modi's leadership
 haalanki party chunaav se pehle unhen hi apana pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar tay karegi is par rukh abhi saaf nahin he
 3
 bijepi adhyaksh pad ke chunaav par padegaa asarabijepi ke maujuuda adhyaksh nitin gadakari kaa kaarykaal disambar maah ke ant tak khatm ho jayega
 The party has postponed the election of the new president for a month in view of avoiding political turmoil
 nitin gadakari ko ek baar phir bijepi kii kaman milegi, ise lekar sthiti or bhi jatil ho gai he
 Let it be known that in recent times, relations between Gadkari and Modi have not been as sweet as before
 haalanki khabaren aisi bhi hai ki party ke kai varisht netaa narendra modi ko adhyaksh banaakar unke netritv main chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai taaki bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke bich ek utsaah kaa sanchaar ho sake
 At the same time, the NDA alliance also remained strong
 4
 JDU and BJP may have a relationship One of the oldest allies of the BJP, Janata Dal (united) has expressed its displeasure many times over Narendra Modi's growing ambition
 jadyu maanati he ki agar vah narendra modi kaa saath detii he to use iskaa khamiyaja bihar chunaav main bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Where it has the support of minority voters
 agar bijepi modi ko 2014 ke chunaav main apana cheharaa banaati he
 In such a situation, earthquake will come in the politics of Bihar along with NDA
 jiske nattejey doorgaami ho sakate hai
 5
 badalegi narendra modi kii chhavi?khabaren aisi bhi hai ki pichley chunaav kii tulana main is baar zyada alpsankhyak matadaataaon ne narendra modi or bhaajapa ko vot diya he
 Narendra Modi and his supporters can use these figures to improve Modi's image
 haalanki iskaa gujarat ke baahar rah rahe alpsankhyakon par kya hoga iske bare main kah paanaa mushkil he
 When we proceeded on the narrow kutcha road amidst tall weeds, we hired a Bolero carriage no less than a boon
 aamtaur par shaharon ko jodne vaali sadak kii shandaar haalat mukhya sadak se hatate hi thodi patali ho jaati he
 The condition of rural roads is contrasted with blazing highways
 vaise bhi baxur main ganga ke tire jin ilaaqon main ham gum rahe the wo ganga kii baadh or uski dhar se hone vaale kataav ke liye jane jate hai
 This erosion is so high during rainy and flood days that the river slips up to 100 meters in a year
 kinaaron ko kaat kar dhara nayaa pravaah le leti he
 The farmland merges with itself
 nainijor, manikpur, arjunpur or keshavpur
 
 
 These are all areas where the dagger appears in its fiercest form
 umrpur gaanv ke nivasee satyendra thakur bataate hai ki baxur kii aadhi aabaadi kataav kii samasya se peedit he lekin sunne vaala koi nahin
 Some youths filed a PIL in the High Court
 ilaake ke logon ne chunaav ke bahishkaar bhi kiya
 Then after the court order, the work of bridging the edges with sand sacks and stones started
 lekin ye itani dhimi gati se hua he ki nadi kii dhar ke panepan ke aage naakaafi sabit ho rahaa he
 Some edges have been paved with stone, and some sacks have been operated
 lekin boriyaan sad gai hai or usamen bhari ret phir se nadi main samaa gai he
 Hundreds of acres of fertile land has been cut
 sainkado acre kataan kii kagaar par he
 The comments kataan kii ye samasya ek or samasya kii janak he
 The river is cutting the banks of Buxar which falls in Bihar

 But the people of Ballia claim their own claim on it
 keshavpur ke mrityunjay bataate hai ki har koi kataan main gai apni zamin paanaa chahta he
 In such a situation, where the acreage grows, there should be a system of giving land to the farmers
 lekin aisa hota nahin or gaanv vaale aapas main ulajh jate hai
 The result has been several times until the firing
 kai maamalon ko prashasan sulajhaa letaa he ki lekin samasya itani vyapak he ki wo bhi haath khadey kar detaa he
 The government of UP and Bihar can resolve together
 lekin rajaneta court ke bharose baithne ko kehete hai
 Praveen Kumar Rai of Keshavpur says that leaders make promises before every election but sit down after the election
 is chunaav main bhi netaa har sambhav apane paksh main vot jutaney, pratipakshi ke vot kaatane kii koshish main lage hai
 Meanwhile, Ganga continues to cut the land at her own pace
 gaanv ke log kehete hai ki netaa vot kii fasal ke liye apni nai zamin bana lete hai, hamen kahaan se apni khoi zamin milegi
 By the way, the areas of the Ganges in Buxar where we were roaming are known for the floods of the Ganges and erosion from its torrent
 barsaat or baadh ke dinon main ye kataav itnaa zyaada hota he ki saal bhar main nadi 100 meter tak khisak jaati he
 By cutting the edges, the stream takes a new flow
 khet ke khet apane main samaa leti he
 Nainijor, Manikpur, Arjunpur and Keshavpur
 
 
 ye tamaam aise ilaake hai jahaan kataan apane ugratam rup main nazar aati he
 Satyendra Thakur, a resident of Umarpur village, says that half of the population of Buxar is suffering from erosion but there is no one to listen
 kuch navayuvakon ne hoicourt main janhit yachika daayar kii
 The people of the area also boycotted the elections
 phir court ke aadesh ke baad ret kii boriyaan or pathar se kinaaron ko paatane kaa kaam shuru hua
 But it has happened so slowly that it is proving inadequate in front of the sharpness of the river's edge
 kuch kinare pathar se pate gaye hai to kahi ret kii bori se kaam chalaaya gaya he
 But the sacks have rotted and the sand filled in it has re-entered the river
 sainkado acre upjau zamin cat chuki he
 Hundreds of acres are on the verge of harvesting
 tippaniyan This problem of cropping is the father of another problem
 nadi baxur ke kinaaron ko kaat rahi he jo ki bihar main padataa he
 At the same time, Ganga is leaving sandy land towards Ballia which falls in UP
 kataan main khoyi apni zamin ko baxur vaasi nadi paar baliya main upar hui zamin main talashne jate hai
 Claim it
 lekin baliya ke log us par apana hi daawa jataa baith jate hai
 Mrityunjaya of Keshavpur says that everyone wants to get his land in Katan
 aise main jis kinare par rakabaa badhata he, udhar kisaanon ko zamin dene kii vyavastha honi chahie
 But this does not happen and the villagers get entangled
 nateeja kai baar goli chalane tak kii naubat aa chuki he
 The administration resolves many cases but the problem is so widespread that it also raises its hand
 maamla upi or bihar kii sarkaar mil kar sulajhaa sakati he
 But politicians ask to sit on the court
 keshavpur ke praveen kumaar raay kehete hai ki netaa har chunaav se pehle vaada kar jate hai lekin chunaav ke baad baith jate hai
 In this election too, the leaders are trying to garner votes in their favor and cut the votes of the opposition
 is bich ganga apni raftaar se zamin katati ja rahi he
 The people of the village say that the leaders make their new land for the harvest of votes, from where will we get our lost land

 They beat Belgium 2–1 and Korea 1–0
 german team turmament ke aage badhane ke saath-saath lagaataar acha pradarshan karne ke liye jaani jaati he
 In such a situation, India will have to play very carefully against this team as a single lapse will leave them out of the race for the ninth gold medal

 pashchim bengal main loksabhaa chunaav ke baad bhi hinsa jari he
 The ruling BJP has warned of imposing President's rule at the center, which has been furious over the killings of many party workers so far
 party ke mahasachiv or pashchim bengal prabharee kailash vijayawargeey ne somvaar ko bada bayaan diya
 He has bluntly said that if similar situation prevails in Bengal, then the Center may have to intervene, so we demand Section 356
 kailash vijayawargeey kaa yah bayaan, uttar 24 pargana jile main kaaryakartaaon kii hatya ke baad puure bengal main yojit kaala diwas ke dauraan aayaa he
 Meanwhile, speculation of President's rule in the state has intensified since West Bengal Governor Kesarinath Tripathi arrived in Delhi to meet the Prime Minister and Home Minister
 raashtrapati shashan lagane kaa aadharasamvidhanvid dow
 Subhash Kashyap says that if law and order in a state is completely destroyed
 vahaan ke rajyapal isaki pushti karte hue report bhejein or raashtrapati us report ko sweekaar karen to phir raashtrapati shashan lag saktaa he
 Since the Constitution states that the President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers
 aise main mantriparishad kii sifarish par bhi raashtrapati dhara 356 ke tahat apane adhikaron kaa istemaal kar kisi rajya kii sarkaar ko barkhaast kar sakate hai
 Keep in mind that such steps are taken only when the system of governance is seen to fail in a state
 modi raaj main do baar hua dhara 356 kaa istemalpichhali modi sarkaar ne do baar dhara 356 kaa istemaal kar sarkaron ko barkhaast kiya tha
 In March 2016, Harish Rawat of Congress was sacked by imposing President's rule in Uttarakhand
 jise uttarakhand hoicourt ne ise galat tehraaya
 If the matter reached the Supreme Court, the government lost here too
 isi tarah arunachal pradesh main bhi nirvaachit sarkaar ko barkhaast kar raashtrapati shashan lagane vaale faisle ko 13 july 2016 ko supreme court ne khaarij kar diya tha
 Thus, BJP twice imposed President's rule in two states, but both times the court rejected it
 jise bijepi ke liye jhatka mana gaya
 What will the BJP gain? Political analysts believe that the use of Section 356 is a double-edged sword
 iskaa bijepi ko phayda bhi ho saktaa he or nuksaan bhi ho saktaa he
 If we talk about profit, then there is a BJP atmosphere in West Bengal at this time
 yahaan 2014 main do kii tulana main is baar 18 siten milin
 At the same time, the BJP is continuously breaking the ruling Trinamool Congress camp and breaking its leaders
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki raashtrapati shashan lagu karne ke baad jald chunaav hone par bijepi ko phayda mil saktaa he
 Otherwise, the BJP may have to bear the loss if assembly elections are held till 2021
 vajah ki is dauraan mamata banerjee pashchim bengal main damege control kar saktin hai
 Or if the condition of the economy worsens in the coming time, the central government may be surrounded by a 'self-goal'
 jisase bijepi ke paksh main bana maahaul aage kharaab ho saktaa he
 Due to which the BJP is trying to capitalize on the atmosphere created by making elections ahead of time
 BJP ko sambhavit nuksaanakai raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki pashchim bengal main dhara 356 ke istemaal kii bijepi ko keemat bhi chukaani pad sakati he
 The Opposition will once again raise the issue by calling for an attack on democracy, while Mamata Banerjee can prove herself to be the Victim and gain public sympathy
 uttarakhand yaa arunachal pradesh kii tarah agar pashchim bengal ke maamle main bhi court ne sarkaar ke faisle ko khaarij kiya to bijepi ke liye jhatka hoga
 Political analyst Urmilesh says that presidential rule should not be taken on the basis of mutual differences and tensions between the parties
 dhara 356 ke istemaal se pehle vidhivat prashasnic or sanvaidhanik padtaal jaruri he
 So far in the country, Section 356 has been misused by the governments
 isse raajnneetik dalon kaa kitna hit hua, yah to nahin pataa, magar rajyon kaa jarur ahit hua he
 Urmilesh agrees that the opposition would get an issue against the BJP if the Mamata Banerjee government was sacked in West Bengal

 bhaajapa ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''pehali baar bihar bhaajapa kii team un tamaam ghoshit guton se mukt hokar svachhndatha ke saath sirf modi-shah ke rang main nae yug kaa sutarapaat karne ja rahi he jo 2020 main uttar pradesh kii tarj par hi nai ibaarat likhane kaa madda rakhane vaali he
 "this strategy of the BJP also has lessons from the 2015 assembly elections when the party fell behind in the social equation
 bihar main lalu yadav ne nitish kumaar ke saath mahagathbandhan banaakar jis tarah rasaatal main ja rahi party ko phir se satta main pahunchaaya or chaturaai ke saath viraasat apane beton ko saunp di, usase satark shah ne sabase pehle yadav samudaay ke hi nityanand raay ko pradesh adhyaksh ke rup main aage badhaayaa
 The party's strategy behind this was to prevent the Yadav vote bank from going after Lalu with his son Tejashwi Yadav, as well as to create a new social fabric by combining the Forward, backward-backward and Dalits
 bhaajapa agle chunaav main netaa yaa betaa (nityanand banaam tejasvi) kaa card oochhaalane kii aadharshila rakh rahi he
 Actually after the victory of UP, Bihar BJP has formed a team on the same winning formula
 raay kii nai team guton se mukti kii ore he jahaan sthapit netaaon ko team gathan main tarjeeh dene kii bajaay vishuddh rup se santhnik kushalta, pradhanmantri narendra modi ke nayaa bharat banane ke iraade or sangh ke prati patibaddhta ko paimaana banaaya gaya he
 Social engineering, completely free of factions, has not given place to important faces like Lalbabu Prasad, Suraj Nandan Kushwaha, Sudhir Sharma, who were important in the old team, in the team of Nityanand Rai, which was completely based on the thinking of Shah, who was considered as the charioteer of Sushil Modi faction
 And this faction dominated the state organization
 haalanki media prabandhan or samanvay ke liye pahachaane jane vaale purv upaadhyaksh or pravaktaa rahe sanjay mayukh ko padonnat karte hue shah ne dilli bulaakar media vibhaag kaa rashtriya sah pramukh banaaya he
 This team has only seven officials who have crossed the age of 50
 raay kehete hai, ''sanghathan kii yah soch ki yuva desh kii takat he, usko dhyaan main rakhte hue agade-pichde-noujvaan-dalit-mahila ko team main jagah di gai he
 But this does not mean that the elders were sidelined
 hamaari team bujrgon kii sahabhaagita ke saath naujavaanon kii praathamikta vaali he jo bihar kii aakankshaon ko puraa karne vaali he
 "bihar BJP general secretary in-charge with Bhupendra Yadav says," There is a team of combative people who work
 nae chehron or jeenyu se padhakar gaanvon main kaam karne waalon ke saath samaaj ke sabhi kshetra-varg ko pratinidhitiv diya gaya he
 "out of 32 faces in this team, 17 are from dalit-mahadalit-backward-backward Class
 5-5 bhoomihaar or brahman, 4-4 rajput or vaisya, 2-2 kushvaha or yadav or 1-1 kurmi, kysth, sahani, taanti, chandravanshi, dalit or dhanuk hai
 The number of women in the team is four
 iske alaava sanghathan mantri nagendra savarna to sah sanghathan mantri shivnarayan mahato obisi se aate hai
 In the team of modi-shah and Sangh's Chharaya, a glimpse of Shah's UP strategy is visible
 mahasachiv banaae gaye pramod chandravanshi kahaar samudaay se aate hai or pichley teen saal main obisi ko lekar sangh-bhaajapa kii muhim main teji laane vaale pramukh netaaon main shaamil hai
 Chandravanshi, who has worked in ABVP from the Sangh background, is a Khanty leader who believes in working silently away from the headlines
 mahasachiv banaae gaye radhamohan sharma bhoomihaar hai or sangh ke jamini kaaryakarta hai
 Rajendra Singh, the organization's general secretary of Jharkhand, has been made the general secretary
 bhaajapa kii jharkhand main sarkaar banane main inkaa bada yogadan he
 His name was also in the race for the state president
 mahasachiv banaae gaye susheel choudhary or upaadhyaksh banaae gaye purv patrkaar devesh kumaar ek saath jeenyu se padhe hai
 Devesh explains the specialty of the new team like this, "it is a modi-shah dream-fulfilling team that will take Bihar on the path of social justice and development
" " upaadhyakshon main mithilesh tiwari vidhayak hai jo bihar main ek gut vishesh ke varchasv ke khilaaf hameshaa dabangai ke saath khadey rahane waalon main se rahe hai, isliye tiwari kaa naam pradesh adhyaksh pad kii daud main bhi tha
 Bhumihar leader and MLA Anil Singh has been appointed as the state secretary, while among the secretaries, the young face r Turaj Sinha has been given a place in management
 chunaav prabandhan kii visheshta kii vajah se hi ve shah ke khaas pasandida yuva ranneetikaron main gine jate hai
 Roop Narayan Mehta, d

 Praveen Tanti has also been made secretary from the most backward and Chakma society like Mandal
 dirghakaalik ranneeti ke tahat shah ne bihar bhaajapa ko patna mahanagar se nikalakar gaanv dehaat kii ore mode diya he
 But the way Sudhir Sharma, a former general secretary close to Sushil Modi, has opened a front against Rai, in such a situation, it will be a big challenge for the factions
 haryana ke sarsabj hisar shahar se 32 kimi uttar main based barwaala kasbe main jindagi dharre par laut ai he
 The week-long news channel, the police and the explosion of vehicles blowing the dust of spectacles are over
 ek shaks ko, jo khud ko bhaktikaal ke mahaan nirgun sant kabirdaas kaa avatar kahata tha or jiske chamache use desh ke kanoon or samvidhan se upar bataa rahe the, ek chuuhe kii tarah giraftaar kar police kii vine main bithakar kalkothri main bhej diya gaya
 But the spectacle in the 12-acre Killenuma Satlok Ashram, under the protection of black-clad gunman guards, killed both the dignity and sleep of the Haryana Police, as well as the persistence of Baba Rampal that killed six people, including an innocent child
 darjanon gadiyon main aag lagi or patrakaron kii barbar pitayee hui, so alag
 The relief is that 15,000 people trapped in the ashram were safely evacuated without any major power usage
 adaalat sakht, sarkaar sustajat samudaay ke rampal ke rishte bhi kabhi jat netaa or tatkaaleen congressi mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda ke saath madhur the
 But when in October 2006 Rampal made a disproportionate comment about Arya Samaj's supreme text Satyarth Prakash, most of the Aryasamaji Jats of Rohtak turned against him and Hooda of the Aryasamaji family himself was forced to drive Rampal out of Rohtak
 iske liye ashram ke chah log hooda ke dilli sthit awaas par unase mili bhi the
 However, the case did not go away
 deron kaa rasookh sarkaar kii khamoshi kii thos vajah he
 An example of this is that when the entire nation's eyes were on the Satlok Ashram of Barwala, nestled among mustard fields, then many ministers and mlas of the ruling BJP, led by Kailash Vijayvargiya and Assembly Speaker Kanwarpal Gurjar, were in charge of the party's election in Haryana
 Saint Gurmeet Ram Rahim arrived at k Dera Sacha Sauda to pay his thanks to Insa
 mana jaataa he ki is sabase prabhaavshaalee dere ke haryana main 50 lakh bhakt hai
 Baba, who is facing allegations of murder, sexual exploitation and recently forcibly impotent of 150 of his servants in different courts of Haryana and Punjab, openly supported the BJP in the last assembly election
 chunaav se pehle bhi bijepi kii list jari hote hi uske 45 pratyaashee baba ke paas pahunche the
 Amid the barwala scandal, BJP leaders had to reach the Dera Sacha Sauda in bulk, thanking them for the same favor
 dere ke pravaktaa pawan insa safai dete hai, ‘ek baba ke vivaad main aane se sab ko ek taraazoo main taulnaa galat he
 Guruji is involved in 104 major social works, from building houses for the poor to building prostitutes
 ye saare aarope niraadhaar hai
 We are answering these in court
 ’
 
 
 And Baba is also in sight
 Dera Bhumanshah Sangarsadha of Sirsa has a significant impact in the most backward Kambose community
 sirsa main deraa sachcha sauda jagamaliwali he
 If these camps are for the shelter of Dalits, then people of Sikhism are associated with the Namdhari sect
 dere kaa raag shuruyaat se hi congress ke saath rahaa he
 Apart from these deras, Baba Man Singh's dera at Pahova in Kurukshetra district supported the INLD in the election
 karoda kaa sant rampal ashram, ambala ke swami gyananand kaa ashram, mandivala baba kaa deraa or uske baad isckon or shri shri ravishankar kaa art of living bhi chunavi bhoomika main peeche nahin rahe
 In such a situation, the question of whether the Manohar Lal Khattar government will not have to face two-and-a-half cases like Barwala
 2006 main sant rampal ke rohtak ashram main hua isi tarah kaa bavaal or 2008 main guru govind singh jaisi veshbhusha pahanane ke kaaran sant ram rahim ke bhakton or sikhon ke bich haryana kii sadqon par hua khooni sangharsh bataata he ki kai baar dere apane aap ko samaantar satta samajhane lagate hai
 More than five cases of serious cases are still going on on ram-rahim, the rest of the camp is also struggling with property dispute
 haryana ke zyaadaatar ashram or deron ke mukhiya atyaadhunik hathiyaaron se las nijee gardon ke saath chalanaa pasand karte hai
 In these sensitive circumstances, if the government allows the babas to move on a path of rhetoric for votes, then the heat will be once again on its doorstep as the courts are not going to tolerate anyone
 south dilli ke biji markets main ab shopping karte hue baari pani kii bottle kairi karne yaa kharidne kii jarurat nahi hai
 SDMC has decided to install water atms in the market areas of South Delhi
 philhal demo ke taur par dephence colony ke market main ek water atm lagaaya gaya he jiskaa bahut acha rispance mil rahaa he
 People come and drink water by putting money in water atms, and if there is a bottle, they are filling it up and using cheap and good water for drinking
 water atm ke jariye aap 2 rupee main 200 millilitre, 3 rupee main 300 millilitre, 5 rupee main 1 litre or 20 rupee main 20 litre saaf or thanda pani le sakate hai
 These water atms are also eco friendly as paper cups are being used instead of plastic for drinking water
 philhal dephence colony main lage is water atm kaa log jamkar istemaal kar rahe hai or is tarah ke or water atm kii baat ko saraahaa bhi ja rahaa he
 Keeping in mind the good response from the people, SDMC has decided to install 100 water atms in many big and small market areas including Lajpatnagar, Sarojini Nagar by the month of July
 videshi tarj par bazaaron main khadey yewater atimbazar main shopping karte hue mahilaon or bacchon ko acchhee sahuliyat degaa
 The convenience of water atms is a commendable step, rather than paying the money for water sealed in plastic bottles and contaminating the environment with plastic
 bijepi ke kade virodh ke baad patna jila prashasan ne use aagaamee 27 oktober ko gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii raily ke liye puure gandhi maidan ke upyog kii anumati pradaan kar di he
 Patna District Magistrate n Shravanan Kumar said that after some misconceptions about this have been cleared, BJP has been allowed to use the entire Gandhi Maidan for organizing the said rally on October 27

 Earlier, the event was held at the Gurdnibagh Stadium after the current government refused to give the Miller School courtyard a meeting of the party's national president Rajnath Singh due to political outrage after breaking ties with the NDA

 Are you thinking about exercising somewhere? If 'yes', it may harm you rather than benefit
 darasal, vyaayaam ke bare main sochane se aap 50 fisadi zyada khaanaa shuru kar sakate hai
 The results of a new study suggest that a person starts eating more than merely thinking about physical exercise
 ‘daily mail’ kii ek report ke mutabik, jo log vyaayaam karne ke bare main padhate yaa sochate hai, vah 50 fisadi zyada khaanaa shuru kar dete hai
 According to the researchers, this is due to the 'subconscious reward theory', according to which, when physical or mental efforts are made in relation to exercise, people eat more and benefit themselves

 Police said that this 43-year-old Sikh terrorist was sent to kill Hindu leaders in India

 In fact, when lashkar-e-taiba terrorist Abdul Karim Tunda was arrested in August last year, he told that he had sent a consignment of explosives to Delhi before the Commonwealth Games 2010
 yah maal ratandeep singh ne mangavaya tha
 The Punjab Police was looking for him since last year as he came to know that Ratandeep was trained by Colonel Shahbaz Minhas, a commander of the ISI, last year

 In Sukma, a large number of CRPF teams were surrounded by Maoists
 unke ikattha hone kii bhanak tak nahin lag saki
 Why did this happen after all? The big question before the Ministry of Home Affairs is whether this attack was possible because the fixed benefits within the CRPF were not being implemented
 tippaniyan According to information received by NDTV India, the CRPF has said in its report to the Ministry of Home Affairs that the CRPF contingent has been stationed in Sukma for five years
 kaayade se teen saal main unka tabadalaa ho janaa chahie tha
 It may have caused some fatigue and carelessness in the team
 haalat ye he ki log kashmir main tainaati ko taiyaar hai, sukama main nahin
 The CRPF has also admitted in the report that the attack occurred on the party whose soldiers were eating and were not alerted
 philhal bastar main siarpief ke 45,000 jawan hai, lekin jin halaat main wo kaam kar rahe hai, wo kaaphi chunauti bhare hai
 By the way, it comes again and again that if the soldiers working in an unknown area have to be saved from fatigue and such attacks, then it is necessary to take care of their needs

 He gave a complete intellectual on the nationalist ideology in which he told how the BJP is devoted to its ideology
 congress ko bataaya parivaar kii partibijepi adhyakshmit shahne apane bauddhik main kaha ki congress kii apni koi vichaardhaara nahin he
 The biggest reason behind this is that for the freedom movement, be it socialist, leftist or nationalist ideology, the Congress was just a platform for the freedom fighters to fight the freedom struggle
 isliye aazaadee ke kai saal baad bhicongresski apni koi kor vichaardhaara nahin thi
 This was the reason that due to lack of ideology, the Congress became a family party
 vichaardhaara or kaaryakartaaon ko bataaya takatbijepi adhyaksh ne aage kaha ki ye baat sach he ki jis raajnneetik dal kii koi vichaardhaara nahin hoti he wo parivaarwaad se grast ho jaati he yaa phir kisi vyakti vishay par nirbhar hoti he
 It has many examples in today's political scene
 shah ne ye bhi kaha ki bijepi ne pichley 65 saalon main apni vichaardhaara ke saath kabhi bhi samjhauta nahin kiya he, jis vajah se party main din-pratidin hajaaron ki sankhya main log jud rahe hai
 bjp's real strength is its ideology and activists
 soshal media ko jaruri maanate hai piempm modior amit shah ko lagata he ki aaj ke digital jamaane main soshal media kaa apana bahut mahatv he
 This is the reason that this was the third time that party president Amit Shah had interacted with bloggers and activists on social media in the last three months
 soshal media nahin, kaam jarurimatlab saaf he ki piem modi ko lagata he sarkaar or party kii chhavi ko janata ke bich main acha yaa bura banane main soshal media kaa aaj ke jamaane main bada mahatvapurn role he
 PM Modi has forgotten that the good image of the government and the party is automatically created by his works

 According to local media, 33-year-old Raman was reported missing on Saturday and was last seen walking towards the reservoir
 raman ek nirmaan majdoor tha
 Eyewitnesses quoted eyewitnesses as saying that the man had refused to seek help from people passing by, who tried to throw things floating in the water to save him
 khabaron main raman ke mitron ke hawaale se kaha gaya he ki vah paariwarik samasyaon ke chalate ek hafte se kuch ajeeb sa vyavhaar kar rahaa tha
 He was married

 During the hearing of the Mumbai attacks for a year, the mood of Ajmal Amir Kasab kept changing, sometimes he showed his confession, sometimes he turned around and sometimes no one in the court could understand it
 is dauraan vah kabhi vah chillaaya to kabhi vah hansaa jisaki vajah se use nyaayadhish kii daant bhi khaani padi
 The hearing started in May 2009 at the initial level
 sunwaayee ke dauraan kasaab kareeb pratidin nyaayadhish ko pranaam karata tha
 He smiled when a witness in the court identified him
 sunwaayee ke dauraan kasaab us samay bada baichaiyn ho jaataa tha jab koi gavaah yah bataata ki pakistani aatankwaadi ne hi vibhinn jagahon par aatankwaadi hamale kiye the
 However, Kasab did not speak a single word in response and listened carefully to the hearing process
 jaise-jaise sunwaayee prakriya aage badi kasaab kii niraashaa badhati gai or vah adaalat tathaa jail main apni jhallahat vyakt karne laga
 Kasab used to throw food in his cell and demanded biryani and mutton
 usne kahani kii kitaab or parafum diye jane kaa anurodh kar logon ko aashcharya main daal detaa tha
 He used to make such demands in the presence of the media or Judge ML Tahiliani to get his attention
 isiliye tahiliyani patrakaron ko uski maangon ke bajaay sunwaayee par dhyaan dene ke liye kehete the
 Once he had demanded to see the CD of the recording of the attack he had done but the court rejected it
 usne makka ke liye ek patr likhane kii anumati maangi thi lekin usne yah nahin bataaya ki patr kise bhejnaa he
 Kasab sought permission to move out of his cell but the court rejected it
 media main ai khabaron ke mutabik kasaab ke kamare main lage sisitivi camere se pataa chalaa ki vah akhbaar bhi kha jaataa tha
 Meanwhile, Kasab's lawyer KP Pawar said that he had no idea that Kasab had expressed his disappointment
 pavaar ne bataaya ki unhen kasaab se baat karne ke liye pratidin 10 se 15 minute milte the
 He said, 'during this time also security personnel were present, so we used to talk only on the matter

 har saal ek gaanv ko god lene kii yojana main kuch hi saansad ab tak gaanv ko god le paye hai par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane duusare saal main duusare gaanv ko god liya
 Significantly, there is no separate fund for the development of the mp's adoption of the village
 lihaaja agenciyaan or duusari santhaayen vikaas main madad kar rahi hai par unke kaam se gaanv vaale santusht nahin he
 This resentment is also visible in the Prime Minister's own adopted village Nagepur

 This box came to be installed here but could not stand in the strong storm
 aise kai shauchalay gaanv main gire nazar aayege, par bahut se khadey bhi the or kaam bhi kar rahe the lekin uski apni kamiyaan bhi hai
 The biggest problem is with its sockpit, which is made of eight feet of pits under the seat
 shauchalay kii jameen bhi plastic kii he jo baari vajan se dabati he or neeche sokapit kaa gadhdha he
 So people are afraid that if they get broken and fall, they will die
 ise or spasht rup se gaanv kii mahila niyaasi bataati he ki " isamen yahi pareshaani he ki isame koun dam he, aadmi baithe to neeche gir jayega tej hawa chalegaa to ye gir jaayegaa
 Give only one wish of our brick, but give it right
 
 
 ' There are flaws in this plastic toilet, it does not like them because it was Lohia village before and there are brick paved toilets in it

 When the PM adopted the village, this time he got Ambedkar's idol and park but still could not get the basic facility, which he seems to complain about
 dalit basti ke ram charan kehete hai " yahaan par kuch aise kaam hue hai ki shauchalay bana to anya biraadaari ko mila
 The Harijan fraternity did not get any
 kuch road bane he jo matlab he ki saamne padaa he kaccha, wo nahin bana ye dubaara ban gai
 We have a park here
 baaki pani kii samasya he
 People of BJP come and say but it did not happen
 tippaniyan It is not that nothing happened in this village
 piem ke god lene ke baad anganbari ke liye nand ghar bana, bas stand bana, baithne ke liye bench lageen or sabase bada kaam ek 15 kilowat kaa solar plant laga jisase 25 gharon main bijli mil rahi he
 But in this village with a population of 25 hundred, there is more Rajbhar, Patel Dalit fraternity, whose main occupation is weaving
 kabhi 500 gharon main karghe se nai nai sari shakl akhriyaar karti thi par aaj sirf 75 gharon main bamushkil kargha zindaa he
 Most of the artisans are forced to do Gujar Basar by doing wages

 In spite of these shortcomings, a good thing is that the mps of the country where they are not able to work in their adopted villages till now and many have not even adopted
 aise main pradhanmantri kaa ye prayaas saraahneey to he par jis tarah sansthaaen kaam ko anjaam de rahi he vah santosh janak nahin he
 The Prime Minister should focus on this, then his plan will be completed somewhere
 vaise bhi pradhanmantri jis gaanv ko god lete hai, vahaan logon kii ummiden bad jaati he
 The work that is being done is below their expectation
 aise main logon ko kuch naaraazgi bhi he or salaah bhi de rahe he ki ek kaam karen par thos karen
 The thing to see now is whether his advice reaches the Prime Minister's advisors or not

 sabase badi samasya uske sokapit ko lekar he, jo seat ke neeche hi aath feet gadhde kaa bana he
 The toilet ground is also plastic which is suppressed by heavy weight and there is a hole in the sockpit below
 lihaaja log darate hai ki kahin tut gaya or gir gayi to jaan hi chali jaayegi
 It is more clearly the woman of the village Niasi states that "there is a problem in this, who has the power, if a man sits down, the strong wind will fall, then it will fall
" hamake eenta ke chaahi ek hi dijiye par thik dijiye
 
 
 ' plastic ke is shauchalay main khamiyaan to hai hi, ye isliye bhi inhen raas nahin aa rahaa he kyonki pehle ye gaanv lohia gram tha or usame eent ke pakke shauchalay bane hai
 Due to Lohia village, development took place here already, but Dalits were left deprived in it too
 piem ne jab gaanv ko god liya to aas jaagi par is baar inhen ambedkar kii murti or park to mila par abhi tak moolbhoot suvidha nahin mil pai, jisaki ye shikaayat karte nazar aate hai
 Ram Charan of Dalit Basti says, "there have been some such things here that toilets were built and other fraternities got them
 harijan birdari ko ek bhi nahin mila
 Some roads have been built, which means that it is lying in front, it did not become raw
 hamaare yahaan ek park bana
 The rest is a water problem
 bijepi ke log aate hai kehete hai par nahin hua
 The comments aisa nahin ki is gaanv main kuch nahin hua
 After the adoption of the PM, Nand houses were built for Anganwadi, bus stand, benches were made to sit and the biggest task was to install a 15 KW solar plant which is getting electricity in 25 houses
 lekin 25 sau aabaadi vaale is gaanv main rajbhar, patel dalit birdari zyaada he, jinka mukhya vyavsaay bunakari he
 Once upon a time, a new sari used to loom in 500 looms, but today in only 75 houses the loom is barely alive
 zyaadaatar karigar mazdooree kar guzar basar ko majaboor hai
 Therefore, his first demand from the Prime Minister is to resurrect his ancestral business
 in kamiyon ke baavjood bhi ek acchhee baat ye he ki desh ke saansad jahaan abhi tak apane god liye gaanv main kaam nahin kara paa rahe hai or bahuton ne to god liya bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, this effort of the Prime Minister is commendable, but the manner in which the organizations are executing the work is not satisfactory
 is par pradhanmantri ko dhyaan dena chaiye tab kahin unka mansuba puraa ho paayegaa
 Anyway, in the village where the Prime Minister adopts, the expectations of the people increase
 jo kaam ho rahaa he wo inaki ummid se bhi neeche he
 In such a situation, people also have some resentment and are advising them to do one thing but do concrete
 ab dekhne vaali baat ye hai ki inaki ye salaah pradhanmantri ke salaahkaaron tak pahunchati he yaa nahin

 Once upon a time, a new sari used to loom in 500 looms, but today in only 75 houses the loom is barely alive
 zyaadaatar karigar mazdooree kar guzar basar ko majaboor hai
 Therefore, his first demand from the Prime Minister is to resurrect his ancestral business
 in kamiyon ke baavjood bhi ek acchhee baat ye he ki desh ke saansad jahaan abhi tak apane god liye gaanv main kaam nahin kara paa rahe hai or bahuton ne to god liya bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, this effort of the Prime Minister is commendable, but the manner in which the organizations are executing the work is not satisfactory
 is par pradhanmantri ko dhyaan dena chaiye tab kahin unka mansuba puraa ho paayegaa
 Anyway, in the village where the Prime Minister adopts, the expectations of the people increase
 jo kaam ho rahaa he wo inaki ummid se bhi neeche he
 In such a situation, people also have some resentment and are advising them to do one thing but do concrete
 ab dekhne vaali baat ye hai ki inaki ye salaah pradhanmantri ke salaahkaaron tak pahunchati he yaa nahin
 
 
 
 
 In spite of these shortcomings, a good thing is that the mps of the country where they are not able to work in their adopted villages till now and many have not even adopted
 aise main pradhanmantri kaa ye prayaas saraahneey to he par jis tarah sansthaaen kaam ko anjaam de rahi he vah santosh janak nahin he
 The Prime Minister should focus on this, then his plan will be completed somewhere
 vaise bhi pradhanmantri jis gaanv ko god lete hai, vahaan logon kii ummiden bad jaati he
 The work that is being done is below their expectation
 aise main logon ko kuch naaraazgi bhi he or salaah bhi de rahe he ki ek kaam karen par thos karen
 The thing to see now is whether his advice reaches the Prime Minister's advisors or not
 
 
 
 
 gurmeet ram rahim ke dere or uski gufaaon ke kukarmon kaa sach hi ek-ek kar baahar aa rahaa tha, lekin ab ram rahim kii mid nite partiyon kaa jo sach saamne aayaa he
 That is really surprising
 hairaan isliye ki yakeen hi nahin aata ki kisi baba kaa aisa rup or aisa sach bhi ho saktaa he
 Ram Rahim used to have such special mid night parties at his camp, in which only girls were allowed to come and know what was happening in these parties
 The choice of girls for the entertainment of Baba
 midnite dance party kaa sachbaba ram rahim ke sang haniprit kii ranginiyaan to puri duniya ne dekhi he
 Everyone has heard stories of exploitation of the Sadhvis under the hypocrisy of spirituality
 lekin ab ram rahim ke dere main 'mid nite dance party' ke naam par chalati paap lilaon kaa sach aapako jhinzod kar rakh degaa
 You will be surprised to know how Baba used to get the innocent girls in his name in the name of these dance parties and use them as they wanted
 kai baar sab kuch jaanate samajhate hue bhi ladkiyaan uff tak nahin kar paati thim
 The only girls' entry into the parties would you believe that Ram Rahim used to organize such mid-night dance parties at his camp, which did not allow any other man to be present
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki in dance partiyon main ram rahim ke alaava sirf or sirf ladkiyaan hi bhaag le sakati thim
 In these parties, in the name of giving darshan, sometimes in the name of feeding prasad, he not only looted millions of rupees from his own devotees, but sometimes he used to go beyond all limits in these parties
 khaas agent jutate the ladkiyandere main seva kar chuki sadhviyon or sevadaaron kii maane to asal main in partiyon kaa makasad ram rahim ke haram ke liye waisi ladakiyon kaa chunaav karnaa hota tha, jo baba kii kaali chaaya se bachi rah jaati thi
 For this reason, he used to give feasts not only to the girls in these dance parties, but he also used to put sadhvis after him to sort out some selected girls from the party and bring them to his cave
 ye sadhviyaan darasal baba kii wo khaas agent hoti thim, jinka kaam baba ke liye ladakiyon kaa intazaam karnaa tha
 Use social media to trap girls
before we remove the curtain from this whole trap of Baba, let us first tell you how Baba had left his agents even in social media to trap girls
 
 haryana police ke haath laga fasebuk massenger kaa ek chat laga he
 In which there is a conversation between an agent of Baba, Sadhvi and Baba's devout girl, Sadhvi is preparing the devout girl for the dance party to be held in the camp
 kabhi ye agent use party ke niyam kaanoon bataati he or kabhi bataati he ki kaise mahaz 12-15 hazaar rupee kii evaj main vah ladki baba kaa khaas saannnidhya paa sakati he
 But the most important and most shocking part in this entire chat is the one in which Sadhvi asks the girl to come alone to the party
 ladki baba kii sadhvi se apane pati ko saath laane yaa naa laane kaa sawaal puuchhati he, jis par sadhvi kaa jawaab hota he ki is party main sirf ladakiyon ko hi aane kii ijazat he
 Baba used to implicate the girls in the name of miracle
 Now the question arises that what happened in these mid-night dance parties of Baba that a man was not allowed in them? Now, when Banda's handiwork has come out, the real secret of these parties is coming out
 baba se bidak chuke raazadaaron kii maane to rou ba rou nite ke naam par ram rahim aisi partiyon main ladakiyon ko bula kar unhen apane vash main karne kii koshish karata tha
 He used to play miracles in them
 uske agent isamen apana khaas role nibhaate the
 Once Baba's touched was bought by a warden of the Girls Hostel of Keenu Dera for a full eight lakh rupees
 ab zaraa sochie warden kii is kharid kaa dere kii ladakiyon par kya or kaisaa asar hua hoga
 He used to use them by trapping girls in his web

 usne sochaa bhi nahin tha ki kuch minute baad hi uski jindagi hameshaa ke liye badal jaaegi
 Actually, software engineer Mansi Joshi was hit by a trucker
 is durghatana ne unase unka ek pair chin liya
 She thought at that time that she would never live a normal life
 magar hausalon kii buland maanasi joshi kaa safar yahaan khatm nahin hua tha
 He chose for himself a journey which few people think of
 apane haal hi ke ek intervyuu main unhone kaha, 'main jab apane dopahiye vaali gaadi se offis ja rahi thi, tabhi ek trek ne dhakka maar diya
 The truck went off the top of my leg
 yah us trek driver kii galati nahin thi, darasal, ek pillar kii vajah se vah mujhe dekh hi nahin paaya
 The doctors tried hard to save my leg but after a few days he had to bite due to infection
 'doctor ne jab unase pair kaatane ke bare main poocha tha to unka sidhaa sa jawaab yah tha ki yah to mujhe us haadase ke samay hi pataa lag gaya tha ki aisa kuch jarur hoga
 She says that they had only two ways after that, the first being that they consider it their misfortune and sit and weep over it
 or doosraa yah ki vah is sthiti ko sweekaar karke aage badhen
 Whenever someone came to meet him in the hospital, she would tell him jokes because she did not want anyone to cry because of him
 lekin is ghatana ke baad unka sabase bada dar yah tha ki vah apane sabase priy khel badminton shaayad hi kabhi khel paaengi
 After this, he tried to learn to walk with the help of physiotherapy and his fake leg
 uske baad un pairon ke sahare hi badminton khelnaa bhi shuru kar diya
 During this, he also won many medals while playing matches
 uske baad unhone neshnal level kii bandmiton pratiyogitaaon main hissaa lenaa shuru kiya or vahaan bhi kai match jite
 Mansi says that when people ask her the question of how she can do so much, then she has a simple answer as to who is stopping you from doing anything

 The demand that is coming on the farmers' land should be given to them, otherwise they will block the communal highway
 1984 main sarkaar ke jariye dalit or coli samaaj ko jameen di gai thi, lekin kanoonee taur par aaj din tak unhen jameen kaa kabja nahin saunpa gaya he
 Many people have illegally occupied that land today
 sarkari kaagajon ke mutabik dalit samaaj ko 3,300 acre jameen saunpi ja chuki he, jabaki coli samaaj ko 2400 acre jameen saunpi gai he
 But this land was not given to Dalits and Koli people

 haalanki unke bade netaa saaf taur se kuch kehete nazar nahin aae lekin unke swar se spasht tha ki ve bijepi kii paraajay se khush hai
 He said that for his party, nothing was at stake in this election, so whether seats come or not, it does not matter

 BJP is not in the first list of 78 candidates released in Haryana, Dancer Sapna Choudhary's name was included in BJP this year
sapna Chaudhary, who did amazing work on the floor of the floor, started her political innings with the Bharatiya Janata Party
 Has already done, but Sapna has not yet tried her hand in electoral politics
 ab jabaki haryana main vidhansabha chunaav hone ja rahe hai to aise main sapana choudhary kaa naam charchaa main he
 However, Sapna Chaudhary has not been included in the first list of candidates released by the BJP
 bijepi ne 30 sitambar ko haryana vidhansabha kii kul90 siton main se 78 ke liye ummidavaaron ke naam ghoshitkar die hai
 These include stars like wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, Babita Phogat and former Indian hockey team captain Sandeep Singh

 Sapna said- Let the whole of Haryana tell them that Sapna Chaudhary has recently given her opinion on the question of contesting elections in an interview given to a news channel
 sapana ne kaha he ki puraa haryana unka he, unhen kahin se bhi tikat mil jaae, koi pareshaani nahin he
 Yogeshwar's stakes in the election arena, the seat where the BJP is held, forfeiting this bail statement is very important
 sapana yun to philhal dilli main rahati hai, lekin unka janm haryana ke rohtak main hua he
 Talking of the first list of BJP, the ticket has been announced from Rohtak
 haalanki, sapana choudhary puure haryana main mashhoor hai or unke gane va dance yahaan behad charchit hai
 But no announcement has been made about them from the party

 Sapna had said that if the party says it, she will definitely contest
 baharhaal, pehali suchi main to sapana ko jagah nahin di gai he, aise main baaki 22 siton par aane vaali suchi kaa intjaar sapana choudhary ko jarur hoga
 It has been almost a month for Sonia Gandhi to take over the reins of the Congress, but the party has not yet recovered from the shaking of the Lok Sabha elections and there is no clear plan to revive the party
 haalia loksabhaa chunaav main 542 siton main sirf 52 siten jeetne vaali desh kii sabase puraani raajnneetik party andruni kalah se bhari padi he
 Apart from this, there is also a lack of direction in the party
 saal 2014 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main bhi party ko sirf 44 siton par jeet mili thi
 Amidst disappointment and son's resignation as party president, Sonia Gandhi was appointed as the party's interim president on August 10 at a meeting of the party's highest regulatory body, the Congress Working Committee (CWC)
 saal 2017 main adhyaksh niyukt kiye gaye rahul ne loksabhaa chunaav main party kii haar kii naitik jimmedaari lete hue apane pad se istipha de diya
 Sonia's first responsibility is to build solidarity with the party, stop her resignation and prepare for the upcoming assembly elections in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana in the coming months
 sonia gandhi ne 12 sitambar ko party ke sabhi mahasachivon, pradesh prabhariyon or pradesh adhyakshon ke saath baithak kii or party tathaa mahatma gandhi kii vichaardhaara kaa aahvaan karte hue samanvay kii jarurat par jor diya
 He advised all party leaders not only to be active on social media, but also to go public and highlight the government's 'failures' in the economic downturn and various other sectors
 party main kuch dhade kehete hai ki sonia ne pichley ek maheene main galtiyaan sudhaarney vaale kuch kadam uthaae hai, lekin kuch log maanate hai ki loksabhaa chunaav main durdasha ke baad party ko punerjeevit karne main ve asafal rahi hai
 a party leader said, "we have not yet seen any reformist plan
 abhi tak koi bada nirnay nahin liya gaya
 "he said that 'one person, one post' has not been decided yet under the central leadership of the party
" ek saath kai pad sanbhaalane vaale netaaon ke udhaaharan dete hue unhone kaha ki rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa gulam nabi aaazaad par mahasachiv or haryana prabharee kii bhi jimmedaari he
 Similarly, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath is the State President and Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot is also the State President
 unhone aage kaha ki abhi tak sheersh netritv kii taraf se party kaaryakartaaon ke bikhar chuke manobal ko dobaaraa sudrudh karne kaa koi sanket nahin mila he
 He said, "and to improve the morale of party workers and supporters, major reforms are needed in the party
 " iske alaava party ko jin rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai, vahaan karnataka, telugana, goa kii tarah netritv parivartan karne kii jarurat he
 Resignations were followed in these states after the Lok Sabha elections
 in rajyon main pichley kuch maheenon main congress ke kai vidhayakon ne samuhik istife die hai
 In Karnataka, the party lost its 14-month-old coalition government to the BJP in July, when several of its mlas switched sides
 congress ne kaha ki is saal july main uttar pradesh main sabhi jila ikaiyaan bhang kar di gai thim, lekin unhen punargathit karne ke liye abhi tak koi nirnay nahin liya gaya he
 He said, "and now byelections are to be held in 13 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh
 to vahaan party kaa netritv koun karne vaala he?" vahiin duusari taraf congress ke ek mahasachiv ne kaha, "sonia gandhi ne pichley ek maheene main bahut kaam kiya he
 He has saved Pati from disintegrating in Haryana and Maharashtra by taking appropriate decisions on time
 " sonia gandhi kii uplabdhiyaan ginate hue party netaa ne purv kendriya mantri kumari shailaja ko haryana congress ke adhyaksh ke rup main niyukt karne kaa ullekh kiya
 He has replaced Ashok Tanwar
 shailaja jahaan sonia kii kareebi hai, vahiin tanvar rahul gandhi ke khaas hai

 Pawar had said that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Textiles kept him in the dark and he came to know about this decision when the Directorate General of Foreign Trade issued the notification on Monday

 Bollywood has seen many young talent in the last 2 years, one of them is Ankit Tiwari, singer of the hit song "sun Raha Hai Na Tu" from the film 'aashiqui 2'
 ankit ne apni shandaar gayaki ke dam par kaaphi naam or kaam kamaaya he
 The hit song 'teri Galiyan' from the film 'ek Villain' was also sung by Ankit Tiwari
 ise alag-alag awards se bhi sammanit kiya gaya he
 Bollywood singer Ankit Tiwari, who was arrested in the rape case, did something similar at the 21st Lions Gold Awards ceremony
 is sho main ankit tiwari ko bhi award se nawaja janaa tha, par jab unka naam pukaara gaya to wo manch par nahin pahunche
 The shocking thing is that he also came to participate in the award ceremony
 lekin awards dhire-dhire sabhi ko die ja rahe the, saath main parformens bhi ho rahi thi or is vilamb ko ankit tiwari bardaasht nahin kar paae, or bina award liye hi chale gaye
 Perhaps Ankit Tiwari has forgotten that the award is respected
 unke is bartaav se to aisa hi prathit hota he ki ankit tiwari ke bheetar abhi se gumaan he, lekin kis baat kaa, ye shaayad unhen hi pataa ho
 We also tried to contact Ankit but there was no response from him

 In a house, the check of love between mother and daughter was played by checkmate
 is lav triangal main ek taraf maa thi, to duusari taraf beti or teesri taraf tha wo aashiq, jise donon chaahate the
 And then the end of this love story was so scary that anyone who heard it was surprised
 kyonki shah-maat ke is khel main ek maa ne apni muhabbat ke liye khud apane haathon se apni jawan beti kaa katl kar diya
 Like the millions of manju-vijayduniya who came close on Facebook, Manju, a housewife from Punjab, too had created a Facebook account with great passion
 jald hi is account main doston kii fehrist lambii hone lagi
 But in the same list, there was a name from which Manju's friendship was different
 ye ek khaas dost tha
 The name was Vijay
 jo hindustan kii sarhad se milon dur saudi arab main rahata tha
 They met in the first talk, and then when the Internet came close to each other, they themselves did not even know
 lekin idhar, in donon kaa pyaar paravaan chadh rahaa tha or udhar takadir is lav story ke liye kuch or hi plan kiye baithi thi
 Seeing the sudden death of Diksha, eight months passed and now Manju's lover Vijay was about to return to India
 vijay haryana ke rewadi kaa rahanevaala tha
 But after chatting with Facebook for months, now both were eager to meet each other
 manju ne vijay ko apane ghar abohar aane kii daavat di or vijay ne ye nyauta kubul bhi kar liya
 Manju's husband had already died
 or wo abohar main apni 17 saal kii beti diksha ke saath akeli rahati thi
 In such a situation, no one could have any objection to their relationship
 ab manju or vijay kareeb paanch maheenon se saath hi rah rahe the
 But in the meantime, Manju's young daughter Deeksha died suddenly mysteriously
 wo apane kamare main fande se latakati hui mili or uske paas hi ek suicide note bhi mila
 At first glance, the matter was of suicide
 tatu se khadey hue sawallekin jaise hi tafteesh aage badi police kii najar ek aisi cheez par padi ki wo chaunk uthi
 a letter written on the arm of Deeksha's corpse saw that his forehead was stunned
 17 saal kii diksha ne kisi dhardaar cheez se apni baanh par vijay likh rakhaa tha
 But Vijay was the lover of Deju's mother Manju
 phir sawaal ye tha ki aakhir diksha ne apni baanh par vijay kaa naam kyon likhaa? kya diksha bhi apni maa ke aashiq vijay se hi pyaar karti thi? yaa phir diksha kii maut kaa sach kuch or tha?police ko diya farji suicide noteudhar, diksha kii maa manju ne diksha kaa jo suicide note police ko saunpa, usamen uski khudakushi kii vajah pushtaini jaaydaad naa milane ko bataai gai thi
 And it was said that his grandparents, tau-tai and Bua, were responsible for this death
 lekin mahaj 17 saal kii umr main property ke liye jaan dene kii baat bhi police ko jaraa ajeeb lag rahi thi
 And when the police proceeded to inquire about the name of Gude Vijay on Deeksha's hand, he came to know the story of the death of this girl, it also boggled the minds of the police for some time
 ji haa, diksha kii maut koi khudakushi nahin, balki katl thi
 And the murderer was also none other than her own Manju
 manju ne kiye ek tir se do shikaarmanju ek tir se do shikaar karnaa chaahati thi
 He along with his lover killed his daughter
 bachane ke liye katl ko khudakushi kaa rang dekar jhuthe suicide note main tamaam sasuralwaalon ke naam bhi likh die
 The police was also investigating this side
 lekin tabhi achaanak laash kii baanh par gude ek naam ne pulisavaalon ko katl suraag de diya
 Now the question was why did Deeksha do this? And why did he commit suicide a few days after writing a victory on his arm? One intriguing thing was that if Diksha too loved Vijay, then why did she commit suicide? Then why did he write the property story by not writing love love in the suicide note? All these clues were pointing to something else
 ab police ne diksha kii maa manju or uske aashiq vijay se alag-alag poochtacha karne kaa faisla kiya
 And the story that came out after questioning both of them was very strange and shocking
 vijay ko lekar maa-beti main jhadapmanju ke aashiq vijay ke uske ghar aate hi manju kii beti diksha bhi use chaahane lagi thi
 But when Manju came to know about this, she got furious on initiation
 ab manju bhi vijay se shaadi karnaa chaahati thi or uski beti diksha bhi
 Meanwhile, Diksha saw her mother Manju and Vijay in an objectionable condition
 ise lekar maa-beti ke bich pehle to joardaar ladaai hui
 And then mother Manju along with her lover Vijay strangled Deeksha
 phir maamle ko khudakushi kaa rang dene ke liye laash fande se taang di
 And to trap the in-laws, Vijay wrote his name in the suicide note
 postmortem se ai sachai samaneudhar, diksha kii maut ke baad se hi uski maa manju or aashiq vijay lagaataar police ko uljhane kii koshish kar rahe the
 Manju did not have good relations with her in-laws and after taking initiation, she wanted to hunt two birds with one stone
 usne pehle to apane hi aashiq vijay se diksha ke naam se ek suicide note likhvaya or phir usamen apane saas-sasur samet kai sasuraaliyon ke naam likhva die
 
 jabaki unka is maamle se dur-dur tak koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 Later in the post-mortem report it was also clear that Deeksha died not because of hanging, but because of strangulation
