 The 20-year-old Renu of Ludhiana, who came to Usuri in Uttar Pradesh after getting married, received a severe blow
 
 
 uske nae ghar main shauchalay nahin tha, or use nibatane ke liye khule maidaanon main janaa padane laga
 
 
 Renu said, "until i was married, i used to think that 'toilet' is a basic need and right
 
 
 main samajhati thi ki ghar main shauchalay hota hi he
 
 
 But when the toilet was not found in my new house, i realized its importance
 
 
 " Well, after struggling for a year and a half, Renu finally finds a toilet in the new house, and is helped by Marta vanduzar-snow, an American phd student who has been living in India for the past three years
 
 
 renu ne kaha ki bharat main ladkiyaan kai pidiyon se bina shauchalayon ke hi rahati aa rahi hai
 
 
 They have to face many difficulties for defecation and urination, and hold that pressure in the body for a very long time
 
 
 america ke boston main pali-badhin marta vainduzar-snow yahaan rajeev gandhi mahila vikaas pariyojna ke saath walantier ke taur par judi hui hai, or is samasya se nijaat paane main hamaare desh kii madad kar rahi hai
 
 
 Marta believes that toilets should be a fundamental right, and should be enjoyed by all
 
 
 ab tak vah usuri, ayodhya kaa purava, jimndaar kaa purava or dhakolia gaanvon main kam laagat vaale 100 se bhi zyaada evapotranspereshan toilet (evapotranspiration toilets) banavaa chuki hai
 
 
 These days she is working to build 20 new toilets in another rural part of Uttar Pradesh
 
 
 dilachasp baat yah he ki marta vainduzar-snow dwaara banawaye gaye evapotranspereshan toilet kii laagat sirf 9,978 rupee aati he, jabaki svachh bharat abhiyaan ke tahat sarkaar dwaara banawaye gaye shauchalay kii laagat lagbhag 17,000 rupee he
 
 
 Construction of these toilets in these villages benefiting from Marta's work has proved to be the end of 'open defecation trend'
 
 
 usuri ke rahane vaale ek gramin ne kaha, "meri beti ke liye shauchalay banvaanaa meraa sapana tha
 
 
 i felt bad that he had to retire in the open, or hold the pressure for too long
 
 
 ab main marta ke saath kaam kar rahaa hum, or apane gaanv main or shauchalay banavaane main unki madad kar rahaa hum
 
 
 i am doing this not for the money, but for the good of my family and the village
 
 
 " See also, a video prepared by NDTV Special Projects team about Marta's work
 
 
 tippaniyan Now we will definitely tell you by commenting, is there any such village in your eyes, where now you have to go for open defecation
 
 
 (marta vainduzar-snow ke bare main adhik vistaar se padhane ke liye yahaan clic karen
 
 
 ) renu kaa kahana tha, "jab tak meri shaadi nahin hui thi, main sochati thi 'shauchalay' to buniyadi zarurat or haq he
 
 
 i used to think that there is a toilet in the house
 
 
 lekin jab mere nae ghar main shauchalay nahi mila, tab mujhe uski ahmiyat kaa pataa chalaa
 
 
 " khayr, dedh saal tak sangharsh karne ke baad renu ko aakhirkaar nae ghar main bhi shauchalay mil gaya, or uski madad kii america piechdi chaatra marta vainduzar-snow ne, jo pichley teen saal se hindustan main hi rah rahi hai
 
 
 Renu said that girls in India have been living without toilets for many generations
 
 
 unhen shouch tathaa mutratyag ke liye dheron kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, or bahut-bahut der tak us dabaav ko sharir main hi rokkar rakhana padataa he
 
 
 Marta vanduser-snow, raised in Boston, USA, is associated with the Rajiv Gandhi Women's Development Project here as a volunteer, and helping our country overcome this problem
 
 
 marta kaa maananaa he ki shauchalay moolbhoot adhikaar hona chahie, or ise sabhi ko milanaa chahie
 
 
 So far, she has built more than 100 low-cost evapotranspiration toilets in Usuri, Ayodhya's Purva, Zamindar's Purva and Dhakolia villages
 
 
 in dinon vah uttar pradesh ke ek or gramin hisse main 20 nae toilet banavaane ke liye kaam kar rahi hai
 
 
 Interestingly, the Evapotranspiration toilet built by Marta vanduzer-snow costs just Rs 9,978, while the cost of the toilet built by the government under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is around Rs 17,000
 
 
 marta ke kaam se labhanvit hue in gaanvon main in shauchalayon kaa nirmaan 'khule main shouch kii pravriti' kaa ant sabit hua he
 
 
 a villager from Usuri said, "it was my dream to build a toilet for my daughter
 
 
 mujhe is kaa bura lagata tha ki use khule main nivrutt hone janaa padataa tha, yaa dabaav ko bahut der tak rokkar rakhana padataa tha
 
 
 Now i am working with Marta, and helping her build more toilets in my village
 
 
 main yah sab paise ke liye nahin, apane parivaar or gaanv kii bhalaai ke liye kar rahaa hum
 
 
 " aap bhi dekhie, marta ke kaam ko lekar NDTV special projects team dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya ek video
 
 
 The comments ab hamen coment kar zarur bataaiga, kya is tarah kaa koi gaanv aapaki nazar main bhi he, jahaan ab khule main shouch ke liye janaa padataa he

 The fighter plane is the F-16 at the center of the debate between India and Pakistan in the skies
 pakistan is baat ko seenaa thonkkar kah rahaa he ki usne bhartiya airspes main jaakar atake kiya, lekin wo ye baat maanane ko bilkul raji nahin he ki usne is oparation main ladaaku vimaan F-16 kaa istemaal kiya
 While the Indian Air Force on Thursday proved the evidence that the aircraft sent by Pakistan to the Indian border included the F-16
 ab sawaal ye he ki aakhir epa-16 ko lekar itani bahes kyon he or pakistan is vimaan ke bharat main aane se inkaar kyon kar rahaa he?darasal, pakistan kii is asweekaaryata ke peeche america kii wo sharten hai, jo epa-16 vimaan se judi hai
 This is the fighter aircraft that America gave to Pakistan to fight the war against terror
 lekin ab pakistan isse aatankiyon ko hi bachaane main lag gaya he
 US Rules for the F-16 F-16 is a us-made fighter aircraft, and the Amrom missile it carries is also made in the US
 apane is vimaan ke istemaal ke liye america kii sharten hoti hai
 This aircraft was given to Pakistan with the condition that it could not use it in any confrontation without the permission of the US
 yani kisi duusare desh par akraman ke liye ise pakistan istemaal nahin kar saktaa he
 Pakistan can use this aircraft only to take action against terror
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah sabase badi vajah he jiske chalate pakistan apane dussahas kii gaatha to puri duniya ko bataane ke koshish kar rahaa he, lekin saath hi epa-16 vimaan dwaara atake kii baat sire se nakaar rahaa he
 Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor said in his official statement on February 27 that the fighter F-16 claimed to have been dropped by India was not part of the mission
 bharat ne bataaya sainya thikaanon par hamalaa26 farvari ko pakistan ke balakot main bharat kii airforce ne jo strike kii, wo jaish aatankiyon ke thikaanon par thi
 The Indian Foreign Ministry in its official statement termed the action as an action against terror based on intelligence input
 jabaki pakistan ne agle hi din jammu-kashmir ke rajouri main apane fiter vimaan bhejkar bhartiya sainya thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 The Government of India, in its statement on February 27, has clearly stated that Pakistan's response to India's action against terror has been attacked by the military bases, which is a violation of the rules
 pakistan ke isi dussahas kaa pardaafash karne ke liye donon deshon main epa-16 ko lekar charchaa he
 Pakistan is constantly refusing to send this aircraft into the fight, while Air Vice Marshal RGK Kapoor of the Indian Air Force has proved that Pakistan has shown India's fight against terror by showing a piece of Emrom missile in F-16
 To answer this, he has used the aircraft that the US gave him to fight terrorism
 ab dekhnaa he bharat ke saboot ke america is disha main kya karrwai karata he

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis's face was tensed at an all-party meeting on July 28 to discuss the Maratha movement to demand reservation
 mukhyamantri ne endie sahyogiyon or vipakshi dalon ke 20 pratinidhiyon se halaat par kaabo paane main madad kii apil kii or kaha, "maamla hycourt main he, mere haath bandhe hue hai
 "the anger of the Marathas is creating a furore on the road demanding 16 percent reservation in government jobs and educational institutions
 andolankaaree sadaken jam kar rahe hai or gadipoon main aag laga rahe hai
 He has threatened to completely shut down Maharashtra on 9 August
 maraathon ke gusse kii vajah se ek tarah se mukhyamantri mumbai ke sachivalay "mantralay'' ke apane daftar tak hi simit hokar rah gaye hai
 It seems that Fadnavis has fallen alone in his BJP too, neither his cabinet colleague nor any party leader is coming forward to help
 andolankaaree maratha netaaon ne mukhyamantri se baat karne se inkaar kar diya he, kyonki unka maananaa he ki mukhyamantri ne hycourt main unke maamle ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya he
 Fadnavis also had to cancel his Pandharpur pilgrimage on 22 July
 ve har saal bina naga ashadhi ekadshi ko mandir main darshan karne pahunchate rahe hai
 He said that there were intelligence reports that Maratha protesters could set off a stampede in the crowd of about 10 lakh devotees who gathered on that occasion
 isse maratha samudaay unase or naaraaz ho uthaa
 Earlier, on July 9, Fadnavis had said that 16 per cent of the huge recruitment drive for 72,000 government jobs would be held up as "backlog", awaiting the Marathas for the High Court's decision on reservations
 In
 lekin yah bhi ulta hi sabit hua
 Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil is the only senior BJP leader to publicly defend Fadnavis
 rajya bhaajapa pramukh rawasaheb daanve to rahasyamay chuppi banaae hue hai
 Meanwhile, despite the all-party meeting on 28 July, Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena met on 30 July to strategize on how to surround the Fadnavis government
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne kaha, "sarkaar ko bina kisi deree ke maratha aarakshan kii ghoshnaa kerani chahie
 "state Congress President Ashok Chavan demanded that Governor Vidyasagar Rao interfere immediately, as the situation is going out of control of the Chief Minister
" kanoonee taur par dekhen to is samay fadavis kuch khaas nahin kar sakate
 Experts say that their failure to practice all has alienated them
 unhone bombai hycourt ke nirdesh par maharashtra pichhadaa varg ayog kaa 2015 main gathan yah nirdhaarit karne ke liye kiya gaya he ki maratha samudaay ke log pichde hai yaa nahin
 He also assured the Marathas that they would implement the reservation as soon as the Commission's report comes (it also needs the approval of the High Court)
 lekin yah ayog bhi shithil sabit hua
 Its first judge, Sambhajirao Mhse died last year
 maujuuda jaj em
 Yes
 gaekwad kaa kaarykaal sitambar main samaapt ho rahaa he
 But they can report in three months after getting the extension
 fadavis ko ummid he ki atirikt karmchaaree or sansaadhan muhaiyaa karaane se report agast ke ant tak aa sakati he
 Critics say it should have been done earlier
 abhi to kai kaam baaki hai
 Fadnavis has promised that hostels for Maratha students will be built in all 38 districts of the state, but work has started in only two districts Kolhapur and Pune
 unhone maratha chaatro kii aadhi fees sarkaar dwaara dene kii ghoshnaa bhi kii thi, lekin zyaadaatar collejon ne puri rakam pehle liye bina chaatro ko daakhila dene se inkaar kar diya
 So, until the solution is resolved, the stars of Fadnavis will remain in the cloud

 Home Minister Amit Shah's speech in both the Houses of Parliament on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir is in discussion
 dhara 370 or jammu-kashmir punargathan bill ke masale par sadan ke donon sadanon main jis tikhe tevar or tathyon ke saath unhone bhaashan diya, use karishmai bataaya ja rahaa he
 He even said that he is ready to answer every question on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in the House
 unhone kai baar dhara 370 or yuan ke masale par congress kaa stand poochkar uske saansadon ko asahaj kar diya
 Mukherjee did not support Article 370 Amit Shah said during the debate on Article 370 in Lok Sabha on Tuesday that it is wrong that Article 370 was created due to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 neshnal conference saansad hasanan masudi ne jab dhara 370 par shyama prasad mukherjee kii sahmati kii baat kahi to amit shah ne kaha ki vah kahin par bhi reference laakar dikhaa den ki shyama prasad mukherjee ne dhara 370 kii baat kii he
 He said that you have the right to speak, but that does not mean that you will speak untrue
 unhone kaha- main masudi sahab se poochna chahta hu ki kahaan par mukherjee ne dhara 370 kaa swaagat kiya tha
 They have given up their lives to remove 370
 hasanan masudi ne phir poocha ki kya mukherjee kii sahmati se dhara 370 nahin hua
 To this Amit Shah said- He says that Mukherjee was a member of the cabinet
 main sadan ke record ke liye bataanaa chahta hum ki vah cabinet kisi ek party kii chuni hui cabinet nahin thi
 There was an all-party cabinet
 samvidhan sabha main jo prastaav gaye hai, ve cabinet ke jariye hi gaye hai
 The assembly itself has done the work of writing the constitution by discussing it
 After the constitution was formed, it was decided that any proposal that would go to become a law would go through the cabinet
 us cabinet ko adhikaar samvidhan sabha ne diya, jisane samvidhan banaaya
 So Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was inside the cabinet does not mean that he supported Article 370
 canapati par gan rakhkar to nahin laa sakateloksabhaa main jab congress netaa shashi tharur ne faruk abdulla ke najarband hone kaa sawaal uthaaya to amit shah ne is baat ko khaarij kiya
 He said, "farooq Abdullah is in his house
 na house arest hai, na ditension main he
 His health is also good
 moujmasti main hai, aap jaraa baat kar lijie
 If they do not want to come here, then they cannot be brought by placing guns on the temple
 amit shah ne shashi tharur ke ek daawey ko lekar chutki bhi lee
 He said that Shashi Tharoor, what he is quoting for, is not for Sardar Patel but for Shyama Prasad
 shaayad us vakt house main nahin the
 Someone has caught them wrong chit
 dhara 370 kashmir ko bharat se jodne se rokatii hajammu-kashmir punargathan vidheyak par bahes ke dauraan amit shah ne kaha ki ek sawaal uthaa ki pioke kashmir ko de diya
 i want to clarify that BJP and Modi government can never leave pok
 aaj bhi pioke kii 24 siten hamaara hissaa rahane vaali hai
 The bill that has been presented mentions pok and Aksai Chin
 ek-ek inch kaa ullekh he
 The claim is as strong as it was before
 amit shah ne kaha ki pehle kai bhaashan hue ki dhara 370 bharat ko kashmir se jodatii he
 In fact, Article 370 does not connect India with Kashmir, but Article 370 prevents India from connecting with Kashmir
 70 saalon se jo tis dil ke andar log dabaakar baithe hai, jab vah samay aata he to anand kii abhivyakti ko auchity se nahin jodna chahie
 Every child speaks that Kashmir is an integral part of India
 chaahe aap bengal main jaaen, tamilnadu main jaaen, gujarat main jaaen, maharashtra main jaaen yaa uttar pradesh main jaaen yah main poochna chahta hum ki yah kyon nahin bolte ki uttar pradesh, punjab, tamilnadu bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 Kashmir has to be spoken because Article 370 cast doubt in the mind of this country and the world whether Kashmir is a part of India or not
 nehru chaahate tho pioke hamaare paas hotenmit shah ne 1965 main bharat-pakistan ke bich hue yuddh ko lekar kaha ki jab sena vijayi ho rahi thi, sena pakistani kabailiyon ke adhikaar kshetra main aane vaale hamaare hisse ko jitkar ai thi, tab ekatarfa shastr viraam kisne kar diya tha
 The This was done by Nehru
 usee kaaran aaj pioke he
 If our armies had been exempted then pok India would have been authorized today
 amit shah ne congress netaa adheer ranjan se poocha-kashmir masale ko yuan koun lekar gaya tha
 There are a lot of documents
 desh ke up pradhanmantri or grih mantri ko vishwaas main liye bagaiyr akashwani ke kamare main pravachan kar diya gaya
 Nehru took the UN
 ve bade vakil hai
 Let me tell you the difference between 370 and 371
 370 jammu-kashmir rajya ke sambadh main asthai upbandh he
 The need for removal is because it reduces the hold of the country's parliament
 dher saare kanoon jo janata kii achchhai ke liye bane hai, ve jammu-kashmir kii janata tak pahunchate nahin he
 Pakistan is provoking the spirit of separatism in the minds of the people of Jammu and Kashmir by pouring petrol
 yuan kaa prastaav to khaarij ho chukumit shah ne loksabhaa main bahes ke dauraan kaha ki varsh 1965 ke andar jis din pakistan kii senaaon ne hamaari simaaon kaa atikaraman kiya tha, usee din yuan vaala prastaav khaarij ho gaya tha
 As far as the UN is concerned, both houses of Parliament of India have full constitutional right to take any decision within the boundaries of India
 masudi sahab ne refrendom kaa mudda uthaaya
 The referendum came to an end only when Pakistan encroached India's borders in 1965
 yuan ne bhi is baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 Amit Shah said that there is a curfew of 72 hours
 main poochna chahta hum ki jab neshnal conference kii sarkaar thi, congress ke samay jab aatankwaad upar ja rahaa tha, tab kitne ghante kaa karfu rahata tha
 Masoodi sir, i thought you would coat your judgment, but you did not, because you also know that this judgment was hollow
 kaha ja rahaa he ki aapkaa agenda sampradayik he
 i want to dismiss this matter outright
 dhara 370 kaise ek sampradayik agenda ho saktaa he
 Are there no Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs in Jammu and Kashmir? kaise yah sampradayik agenda ho saktaa he
 Mr
 Owaisi said that the house is going to make a historical mistake, we are not going to make a historical mistake, but are going to rectify the historical mistake
 mujhe bharosa he ki agle paanch saal ke bheetar piem ke netritv main jo vikaas hone vaala he, use dekhakar ghati kii janata bhi kahegi ki dhara 370 kaa jhunjhuna hamen pakadaa diya gaya tha, usne hamaara bahut ahit kiya

 Many celebrities from many areas spoke of increasing intolerance during Modi's tenure, which has been continuously denied by the Modi government
 ab loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle ajtak ne karvi incits ke saath survey ke jariye yah jaanane kii koshish kii kya vaaki main bharat ashishnu desh ban gaya he
 The survey of Aaj Tak and Karvy Insights revealed that 41 percent of the people of the country believe that intolerance has increased in the country and India has become intolerant
 deshbhar main 41 fisadi log maanate hai ki desh ashishnu ho gaya he, jabaki uttar pradesh main yah aankada 33 fisadi logon kaa he
 However, 41 per cent of the people surveyed on this issue do not believe so
 vahiin uttar pradesh main 38 fisadi logon kaa kahana he ki desh ashishnu nahin bana
 The number of such people in this survey is also high which is not clear in this case
 deshbhar main 18 fisadi or uttar pradesh main 29 fisadi log is sawaal par kuch nahin kehane kii sthiti main hai
 The survey was conducted on 2,478 people
 28 disambar se 8 janvari ke bich uttar prades ke kul 20 loksabhaa kshetron main yah survey karaayaa gaya
 Do you believe that in the last 5 years the country has become more intolerant, there is a difference of 33% in the thinking of men and women in this matter
 purushon main yah antar 34 fisadi kaa he jabaki mahilaon main 31 fisadi kaa antar he
 The survey of Aaj Tak and Karvy Insights shows that the mood of the nation means that the SP-BSP-RLD alliance in Uttar Pradesh can win 58 out of 80 seats in the state and bjp-apna Dal coalition which won 73 seats in the last Lok Sabha elections
 Can be limited to 18 seats
 haalanki agar mayawati or akhilesh yadav apane gathbandhan main areldi ke saath congress ko bhi shaamil kar lete hai to upi bijepi ke liye waterlu sabit ho saktaa he
 According to the results of the survey, bjp's vote share of 2014 is 43
 3 fisadi se ghatakar 36 fisadi rah jayega, lekin use milane vaali siten 73 kii bajaay mahaj 5 seat tak simat jaaengi
 The remaining 75 seats will go to the account of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and Congress
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii ore se narendra modi ko centre kii satta tak pahunchane main uttar pradesh se mili 73 (71+2) siton kaa ahm yogadan rahaa tha, lekin is survey ke nattejey bataate hai ki pradesh main mahagathbandhan bana to bijepi ko tagada jhatka lagegaa hi saath main centre main modi kii vijay rath bhi ruk saktaa he

 wo apni garlfriend kii uljhan ko suljhaana chahta tha
 That's why he made a call
 us shaks ko, jo uski garlfriend ko phone kiya karata tha
 After calling, he called the boy to meet him
 lekin mulaakaat main jo hua, uske anjaam kaa gumaan to usne sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha
 
 
 When that meeting ended, the girl's boyfriend's bloodshot was dropped in the room
 taarikh- 7 farvari 2014, vakt- shaam ke 6:30 baje, jagah- dilli kaa neb sarai ilaaka
 Sanjeev Sejwal, who deals in property dealing near Gate No
 4 of Freedom Fighter Colony in Neb Sarai area of delhi, was sitting in his office with his cousin Sandeep, his friend Paramjeet and his servant Ashok
 tabhi uske offis ke baahar ek nisaan gaadi aakar rukati he
 Sunny, Vijaypal, Rakesh and Aman Goyal descend from it
 inamen se vijaypal aman kaa bodyguard he
 They were all supposed to meet for a meeting
 darasal sandip sejwaal ne ye meeting paramjeet or sani ke bich ek masale ko sulajhane ke liye bulaai thi
 But instead of resolving it goes on deteriorating
 donon pakshon ke bich bahes shuru ho jaati he
 Meanwhile, Paramjit asks Sunny to apologize
 lekin uski baat sunakar sani maafee maangane se inkaar kar detaa he
 Stung by this, Paramjeet slaps Sunny
 apane dost par haath uthta dekh vijaypal bhi paramjeet ko ek tamaacha jad detaa he
 After this, the office environment deteriorates
 sani or vijaypal apni jeb se revolver nikaal lete hai
 Now someone is able to understand something, then Sunny and Vijaypal start firing bullets at Paramjit and his friends
 sanjeev yah dekhakar vahaan se bhagkar apane offis kaa shater baahar se band kar dete hai
 That's when he gets the voice of Paramjit shouting from inside the office
 lekin jab wo offis ke andar dobaaraa ghuste hai, to unhen bhi goli lagati he
 Sandeep receives bullets in the collar bone and arms
 paramjeet ko peeth or kandhe main goliyaan lagati hai
 Since the bullets were fired from both sides, in this cross firing, a bullet is also shot in the chest of Sunny's friend Rakesh
 goliyon kii awaz sunakar aasapaas ke log police ko phone kar dete hai
 Meanwhile, crowds of people gather outside Sandeep's office
 logon kii bheed dekhakar sani, vijaypal or aman vahaan se bhaagane kii koshish karte hai
 Aman manages to run away from the chance-a-crime in the same run, leaving his car there
 sani or vijaypal hawaii firing karte hue ignu road kii taraf daudte hai
 Showing a revolver to a person going from his Innova car on that road and snatched his car
 police bhi bina vakt ganvaae mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunch chuki thi
 So, after reaching there, the police team informs PCR of Sunny, Vijaypal and Aman absconding
 isi bich police se bachane ke liye sani gaadi ko sainik farm kii taraf mode detaa he, lekin neb sarai thane kii ek police team kii gaadi unhen bich main hi rokkar donon ko giraftaar kar leti he
 The police had arrested Sunny and Vijaypal
 unka ghayal dost rakesh bhi uski giraft main tha
 But due to bullets, Paramjeet died on the occasion of a crime and Sandeep Sejwal dies during treatment in the hospital
 lekin marane se pehle police ko is golicond kaa jo sach bataata he, use sunakar har koi hairaan rah jaataa he
 Police had caught Sunny and Vijaypal trying to escape
 udhar aspataal main sandip ne marane se pehle police ko jo bataaya, usase yah maamla uske saamne shishe kii tarah saaf ho chukaa tha
 But would you not like to know the truth in which two people lost their lives in such a minor situation in the slightest confusion
 sani or vijaypal ke giraftaar hone ke baad jo kahani police ke saamne ai, wo use sunakar hairaan rah gai
 According to the police, Sunny and Vijaypal live in Indira Enclave
 sani sonipat or vijaypal rohtak kaa rahane vaala he or donon haryana ke bounsar hai
 But used to work as a private bodyguard in Delhi
 isi dauraan sani kii ek ladki se mulaakaat hui or wo use pasand karne laga
 Not only that, he started calling her
 lekin ladki sani ko pasand nahin karti thi
 The girl told this to her friend Paramjeet
 isi baat ko lekar paramjeet ne sani ko uski dost ko dobaaraa phone karne se manaa kiya or use daant bhi diya tha
 But Sunny and Vijaypal don't mind Paramjit scolding him like this
 darasal paramjeet ko sani kaa uski garlfriend ko phone karnaa bura lag gaya tha
 So he calls him to convince Sunny and not to do it again
 lekin sani ko uskaa daantnaa bura laga tha or wo paramjeet ko sabak sikhaanaa chahta tha
 For this purpose he told this thing to some of his friends
 sani ne yah baat sonipat ke rahane vaale apane ek dost rakesh or dilli ke sainik farm main rahane vaale bijnesman aman goyal ko bataai
 On the other hand, Paramjeet had also told this to his property dealer friend Sandeep Sejwal
 sandip ne paramjeet or sani ke bich ranjish ko khatm karne ke liye ek meeting bulaai
 But during the meeting, instead of settling the matter, the firing started so bad there and two people died in this firing
 ek ladki ko phone karne se manaa karne par baat pehle to kahasuni or phir hathapayee or uske baad itani bad gai ki sani or uske dost vijaypal ne paramjeet par qatilaanaa hamalaa kar diya or is vaardaat main do logon ko apni jaan ganvaani padi

 jaise manovaigyanik swasthya, sunanaa, shaareerik kshamta or isite ityadi, jisase ye pataa chalata he ki wo pramotion ke liye yogya he
 Sources in the Ministry of Home Affairs said that a proposal to make fitness mandatory for promotion of IPS officers has already been given by the Department of Personnel and Training and to all the States and Union Territories for their response
 rajyon ko kathith taur par 3 july tak apane vichaaron or sujhaavon ko waapas karne ke liye kaha gaya tha, lekin abhi tak iskaa jawaab nahin diya he

 In two other amendments proposed by the IOP (salary) Rules by the dopt, the government has sought to evict delays in completion of two years of probation by the IPS officers so that "senior time scale" is up to two years from the date of expiry of probation
 Eligibility for appointment can be calculated

 saath hi police peedit ke haal hi main bane doston kaa role bhi veriphai kar rahi he kyonki aarope ke mutabik ye teenon ladke rape se kuch der pehle ek ek karke baahar gaye the or phir waapas bhi aa gaye the
 So whether these boys have any identity with the accused, all these things are being investigated
 peedit ke mutabik haal hi bane uske doston ne use police main shikaayat karne se manaa kiya
 Then a few days later, the victim told her friends and some relatives of America, after which, through a lawyer, the victim lodged an FIR in Nabi Karim police station and identified herself on the CCTV of the hotel and arrested the accused Jaswant from the hotel
 aaropee ne poochtacha main bataaya ki wo marchent navy main bataur cook kaam karata he

 Therefore, for all companies, they will have to change their corporate policy to make it compatible with the LGBTQ community
 kai echaar export or ge rhite activist kaa maananaa he ki ab corporate companiyon ko apane workaplace par aise niyam-kaayade banane honge jisase vaikalpik sexual orientation rakhane vaale yani LGBTQ samudaay se jude sadasyon ko kisi tarah kii dikkat na ho
 These companies have already made favorable rules
 In India, many companies like Infosys, IBM and Google have already established LGBTQ (lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Quir) friendly rules
 jin companiyon main aisi nitiyaan nahin hai unhen maujuuda aadesh ke mutabik hi apni karmchaariyon se judi nitiyon main or offis ke maahaul main badlaav karnaa hoga
 Such changes will need to be done
 Under the affirmative action of the companies, LGBTQ friendly policies mean that creating an environment whereby people of this community can work with dignity and such positive environment will also benefit the company
 unhen naukari dene main kisi tarah kaa bhedbhaav na ho, workaplace par unke saath kisi tarah kaa bhedbhaav na ho or karmchaaree sahyogi ravaiya apanaaen, ve santushti ke saath naukari kar saken iske zyada maukey hon, unki utpaadakta bade or aise karmchaariyon ke swasthya se judi suvidhaon ko bhi health kii anya suvidhaon ke saath shaamil kiya jaae
 Other employees have to accept partners with the LGBTQ community with the idea of openness
 yah dhyaan rakhana hoga ki workaplace par is samudaay ke logon kaa koi uphaas na kare, unke prati asammaan na ho, unako pratadit yaa unke saath bhedbhaav na kiya jaae

 To elect Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee unanimously as the President, even though the leaders of regional parties other than UPA and NDA are arguing for unanimous or unanimous election, the truth is that apart from Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy to this supreme post till date a consensus could not be reached in the name of a candidate
 desh main raashtrapati ke chauthe chunaav ke samay 1967 main sabase adhik 17 ummidavaar maidan main the jabaki raashtrapati ke paanchave chunaav ke vakt 15 pratyaashee maidan main the
 The election of the 13th President of the country is also no other than this
 ummid he ki is baar samprag ke pratyaashee pranab mukherjee kaa muqabla bijd or annadramuk ke saath hi bhaajapa samarthit sirf pie sangama se hi hoga
 Due to change in the process of presidential elections over time, now the number of candidates who dream of going to Rashtrapati Bhavan has definitely reduced
 raashtrapati pad ke chunaav ko adhik gambhir or mahatvapurn banane ke iraade se pehali baar 1969 main gupt matdaan kii vyavastha lagu kii gai
 Not only this, the process of inserting the serial numbers of the voting papers also started from this election
 desh kii raajnneeti main 1969 ke raashtrapati kaa chunaav bahut mahatvapurn sthaan rakhata he
 In this election, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, the authorized candidate of the Congress, was badly defeated by Indira Gandhi's candidate VV Giri
 yah digar baat he ki 1977 main raashtrapati pad ke chunaav main neelam sanjit reddy nirvirodh chune gaye the
 Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy's uncontested election was an unforgettable event in the country's politics that cannot be imagined in today's political scenario
 desh ke pratham naagarik ke pad par nirvachan kii prakriya main shuru se hi nagarikon ne gahari dilchaspee lee he
 This is the reason that apart from Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, four other candidates also participated in the first election for the post of President in 1952
 raashtrapati pad ke liye 1957 main sampann duusare chunaav main bhi da rajendra prasad kaa muqabla do anya ummidavaaron se hua tha
 Two other candidates were also in the fray in 1962 at the time of the election of Second President Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan
 desh ke tritiy raashtrapati da jakir hossain ke nirvachan ke samay 1967 main 16 anya pratyaashee chunaav maidan main the jabaki 1969 main ve ve giri ke chunaav ke samay raashtrapati pad ke daavedaar pratyaashiyon kii sankhya 15 thi
 Although Neelam Sanjiva Reddy was the authorized candidate of the Congress in this election, VV Giri was fielded by Mrs
 Indira Gandhi
 chunaav ke dauraan sansad bhawan ke kendriya kaksh main ek pratyaashee ke bare main apmanjanak baton ke saath ek gumnaam parchaa banta tha
 Later VV Giri's election was challenged in the Supreme Court on the basis of this pamphlet
 yah digar baat he ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne 14 sitambar, 1970 ko yah chunaav yachika khaarij kar di thi
 In view of the increasing number of candidates in the presidential election and the fact that the validity of the election was challenged in the court, the government amended the Parliament on President and Vice President Act, 1952 in March 1974 on the recommendation of the Election Commission
 in sanshodhano ke baad raashtrapati ke chunaav main prayek ummidavaar ke liye namakan patr ke saath prastaavak ke rup main kam se kam das or anumodak ke rup main bhi itane hi nirvaachakon ke hastakshar anivaary kiye gaye
 Apart from this, for the first time a provision was made to deposit Rs 2500 as the bail amount
 yahi nahin, raashtrapati ke chunaav ko adaalat main chunauti dene ke sambandh main vyavastha kii gai ki sirf parajeet ummidavaar yaa kam se kam 20 nirvaachakon ke sanyukt hastakshar se hi ucchtam nyaayalay main chunaav yachika daayar kii ja sakegi
 After this provision, the number of candidates who went to the election field decreased
 agast 1974 main raashtrapati pad ke liye hue chunaav main fakhruddin ali ahamed kaa muqabla ekmaatr pratyaashee tridiv choudhary se hua jabaki 1977 main neelam sanjeev reddy raashtrapati pad ke liye nirvirodh chun liye gaye the
 In 1982, Giani Zail Singh of Congress was confronted by retired Judge HR Khanna after Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy
 varsh 1987 main raashtrapati ke chunaav main us samay rochak mode le liya jab congress ke aar venkataraman or vipaksh ke nyaayamurti ve krishna ayyar ke alaava ek nirdaleey mithilesh kumaar kaa namakan patr bhi sahi paaya gaya
 The situation of independent Mithilesh Kumar was so bizarre that once he slept under a tree in Moti Bagh during the election, security personnel had to surround him
 mithilesh kumaar ko suraksha kaarnon se nayi dilli ilaake main ek vishaal bangala aavantit kiya gaya tha
 In this bungalow, a large and thick thread was provided for Mithilesh Kumar's gold
 is chunaav main haalanki venkataraman ko baari maton se vijayi hue the lekin mithilesh kumaar bhi 2223 mat praapt karne main safal rahe the
 In the election held after Venkataraman's retirement, Opposition GG Swale, eminent lawyer Ram Jethmalani and Kaka Joginder Singh, who were holding the earth, were in front of Congress's Dr Shankar Dayal Sharma
 is chunaav main jethmalani ko 2704 or dharti pakad ko 1135 mat mili the
 After this situation, the demand that the election of President and Vice President should be made more serious and in this, along with increasing the number of proposals and approvals on nomination papers, the bail amount should also be increased
 tippaniyan After this, once again in August 1997, the government amended the President and vice-president Act through an ordinance
 is sanshodhan ke baad raashtrapati chunaav main prayek namakan ke saath prastaav or anumodak ke rup main kam se kam 50-50 nirvaachakon ke hastakshar anivaary karne ke saath hi jamaanat raashi badhaakar 15 hajaar rupe kar di gayi
 After the completion of Dr
 Shankar Dayal Sharma's term, there was a decrease in the number of candidates in the presidential election and there was a direct contest between the two candidates in these elections
 july 1997 main hue raashtrapati ke chunaav main congress ke pratyaashee ke aar narayanan kaa muqabla purv mukhya nirvachan ayukta tii en sheshan se hua jabaki 2002 main da apije abdul kalam ke chunaav ke samay vam morcha ne captain lakshmi sahagal ko maidan me utaara tha
 Smt Pratibha Devisingh Patil, who reached Rashtrapati Bhavan as the first woman President of the country, also faced elections in 2007
 is chunaav main unka muqabla bhaajapa ke varisht netaa bhairon singh shekhavat se hua tha
 At the time of the fourth election of the President in the country in 1967, the maximum number of 17 candidates were in the fray, while 15 candidates were in the fray during the President's fifth election
 desh ke 13wein raashtrapati kaa chunaav bhi isse itar nahin he
 It is expected that this time the UPA candidate Pranab Mukherjee will be pitted against only bjp-backed PA Sangma along with BJD and AIADMK
 raashtrapati chunaav kii prakriya main samay ke saath badlaav hone ke kaaran ab raashtrapati bhawan jane kaa sapana paalane vaale ummidavaaron kii sankhya nishchit hi kam ho gai he
 The secret voting system was first introduced in 1969 with the intention of making the presidential election more serious and important
 yahi nahin, matdaan patron ke kramank daalane kaa silsilaa bhi isi chunaav se shuru hua tha
 The election of the President of 1969 holds a very important place in the politics of the country
 is chunaav main congress ke adhikrut ummidavaar neelam sanjeev reddy ko indira gandhi ke pratyaashee ve ve giri ne buree tarah parajeet kar diya tha

 darasal, emen das naamak is hatyare par assam main varsh 1990 main ek vyakti kii hatya kaa aarope tha, or iske chah saal baad jab vah jamaanat par azaad tha, usne ek or vyakti kii hatya kar di thi
 Convicted of these murders, the Supreme Court sentenced him to death in 1999
 lekin iske baad uski dayaa yachika tatkaaleen raashtrapati pratibha patil ne us samay khaarij kii, jab yachika daayar kiye hue 11 saal kaa samay biit chukaa tha
 In this case, the counsel for MN Das now argued that 'delay is worse than death', like the other accused who were hanged, and appealed for reconsideration
 nyaayamurti jies singhvi kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne das ke aavedan ko sweekaar kar liya
 The comments ullekhneey he ki pichley hi maheene 11 april ko supreme court ne dilli main varsh 1993 main hue bam dhamaake ke doshi punjab ke aatankwaadi devinder paal singh bhullar kii apil main die gaye isi tark ko khaarij kar diya tha
 The President's office took eight years to decide on the mercy plea of bhullar, who was convicted of killing nine people by the bombings

 Now this decision can have an impact on the petitions of more than 15 hanged people, including three convicts in the murder of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who is in jail in Tamil Nadu, and the infamous Chandan smuggler Veerappan in Karnataka jail Close includes four companions

 When he was asked the question that now Kolkata is going to host the biggest match, he said that he does not agree
 unke liye sabase bada match vishwa cap final he, jo kolkata pehle se hi host kar rahaa he
 The comments pakistan ke liye ye behad acchhee khabar he, kyonki unhen srilanka team ke saath apana abhyaas match pehle is maidan par khelnaa he
 Then, in the Super 10 match on the 16th, you have to meet the Group a qualifier team in Round 1
 matlab 19 march ko hone vaale bharat ke saath mukaable se pehle pakistan halaat se puri tarah vaakif hoga
 At the same time, the Indian team will return to Kolkata after playing a match against the Windies in Kolkata, then a practice match against South Africa in Wankhede and then against New Zealand in Nagpur on 15 March

 In such a situation, when Sourav Ganguly was asked questions regarding the pitch and security matters, he felt free to say that there is nothing to worry about and the pitch will remain flat, batsmen friendly and fours and sixes will be seen
 unhone kaha ki suraksha police degi, jiske liye chintaa kii koi baat nahin he
 Sourav Ganguly, president of the Cricket Association of Bengal, also said that it was like a normal match for him
 jab unase ye sawaal poocha gaya ki ab kolkata sabase bada match host karne ja rahaa he, to unhone kaha ki wo is baat se sahamat nahin hai
 The biggest match for them is the World Cup final, which Kolkata is already hosting
 tippaniyan This is very good news for Pakistan, as they have to play their practice match with Sri Lanka team on this ground first
 phir 16 taarikh ko super 10 mukaable main round 1 main group e kii qualifaayar team se bhidana he
 Meaning Pakistan will be fully aware of the situation before the match with India on 19 March
 vahiin bhartiya team windies ke khilaaf kolkata, phir vankhede main dakshin africa ke khilaaf abhyaas match or phir 15 march ko newzealand ke khilaaf nagpur main match khilne ke baad vaapis kolkata aegi
 Pakistani batsmen can do wonders on the flat pitch, so once again you can expect an exciting match between these two teams
 unhone kaha ki suraksha police degi, jiske liye chintaa kii koi baat nahin he
 Sourav Ganguly, president of the Cricket Association of Bengal, also said that it was like a normal match for him
 jab unase ye sawaal poocha gaya ki ab kolkata sabase bada match host karne ja rahaa he, to unhone kaha ki wo is baat se sahamat nahin hai
 The biggest match for them is the World Cup final, which Kolkata is already hosting
 tippaniyan This is very good news for Pakistan, as they have to play their practice match with Sri Lanka team on this ground first
 phir 16 taarikh ko super 10 mukaable main round 1 main group e kii qualifaayar team se bhidana he
 Meaning Pakistan will be fully aware of the situation before the match with India on 19 March
 vahiin bhartiya team windies ke khilaaf kolkata, phir vankhede main dakshin africa ke khilaaf abhyaas match or phir 15 march ko newzealand ke khilaaf nagpur main match khilne ke baad vaapis kolkata aegi
 Pakistani batsmen can do wonders on the flat pitch, so once again you can expect an exciting match between these two teams
 pakistan ke liye ye behad acchhee khabar he, kyonki unhen srilanka team ke saath apana abhyaas match pehle is maidan par khelnaa he
 Then, in the Super 10 match on the 16th, you have to meet the Group a qualifier team in Round 1
 matlab 19 march ko hone vaale bharat ke saath mukaable se pehle pakistan halaat se puri tarah vaakif hoga
 At the same time, the Indian team will return to Kolkata after playing a match against the Windies in Kolkata, then a practice match against South Africa in Wankhede and then against New Zealand in Nagpur on 15 March
 flat pich par pakistani ballebaaj kamaal kar sakate hai, aise main ek baar hameshaa kii tarah in donon tiimon ke bich romaanchak mukaable kii ummid kar sakate hai

 The Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena alliance in Maharashtra is always a matter of discussion
 donon partiyon ke gathbandhan main hone ke baavjood aise bayaan or tasviren najar aati rahati hai jo ol ij note wel kii bahes ko janm detii hai
 Now that the voting time is near and the two parties are contesting the assembly elections together, the posters of BJP and Shiv Sena have caught everyone's attention
 chunaav prachaar ke liye bijepi or shivasena ne jo poster lagaae hai, unamem gathbandhan kii jagah 'ekala chalo re' kii jhalak dikhaai de rahi he
 The hoardings of the two parties are seen differently in not only Mumbai but also Maharashtra
 shivasena ke poster main bala sahib, uddhav thakare or aditya thakare dikhaai de rahe hai to bijepi ke postaron main pradhanmantri narendra modi, party adhyaksh amit shah, mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis pramukhataa se najar aa rahe hai
 That is, the leaders of both parties are not together in the posters
 sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kaa gungan bhi akelebijapi-shivasena gathbandhan sarkaar ke paanch saal kaa kaamkaaj bhi bijepi ke postaron main prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he
 Interestingly, the government of BJP and Shiv Sena under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis has lasted for five years, but the functioning of the government has not been shown jointly by bjp-shiv Sena
 saath nahin aayaa ghoshnaa patragathabandhan ke elaan ke saath hi ye bhi kaha gaya tha ki bijepi or shivasena kaa ghoshnaa-patr ek saath jari kiya jayega, lekin aisa nahin hua
 The Shiv Sena has released its separate manifesto and has also made populist promises as part of its agenda
 shivasena ne garibon ko paushtik bhojan 10 rupee main dene or sirf ek rupee main 200 swasthya pareekshan karaane jaise vaade kiye hai
 Both the parties are showing their way posters of BJP and Shiv Sena that despite being together, both parties want to try their hand in the elections on their own
 bijepi jahaan devendra fadanvis ko mukhyamantri ummidavaar ke rup main pesh kar chuki he, vahiin shivasena kii najar bhi sarkaar ke sheersh pad par he
 In the Sena posters, Aditya Thackeray, contesting for the first time from the Thackeray family, is also being presented in the same manner
 shivasena ne apane vaadon ke saath postaron main aditya thakare ko aage kiya he
 That is, despite being in the bjp-shiv Sena alliance, the picture of 2014 is seen in the campaign, when the two parties fought separate elections
 nateezon ke baad donon partiyon ne milakar sarkaar kaa gathan kar liya tha, lekin is baar donon partiyon main siton ko lekar to sahmati ban gai he, lekin chunaav ladane kaa tarika vahi purana dikhaai de rahaa he
 In such a situation, it will also be interesting to see what new equations emerge in the event of a bjp-shiv Sena coalition government
 pakistan kaa naam liye bagaiyr bharat ne UN main lagaai latadkaha- vahaan juthi 'izzat' ke naam par hota he adhikaar kaa ulanghanjammu-kashmir main mahila adhikaar mudde ko hathiyaar kii tarah istemaal karne ko lekar bharat ne pakistan kaa naam liye bina use latad lagaai he

 Paloumi Tripathi, the first secretary in India's Permanent Mission to the United Nations, said this in his address on the topic of 'advancement of Women' of the United Nations General Assembly on Monday

 Taking a dig at Pakistan, he said, "at a time when India is reiterating its determination to work towards realizing women's empowerment and gender equality
" aise main bemaani fikrebaaji or swarthpurna raajnneetik laabhon ke liye mahila adhikaar ke mudde ko hathiyaar ke taur par istemaal karne ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Today a representative made an unwarranted comment about the internal issues of my country and tried to politicize the issue in an insensitive manner
 'sanyukt raashtra mahasabha kii 6 samitiyon main se ek yah samiti saamaajik, maanviya maamle tathaa maanavadhikaar muddon ko dekhati he
 Tripathi did not directly name Pakistan, but she was replying to Islamabad's outgoing diplomat Maliha Lodhi in the United Nations about Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistan ne kya kaha tha?pakistani rajanyik lodhi ne samiti main kaha tha ki jammu-kashmir main sanchaar thap hone kii vajah se rajya kii mahilaon ko pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Not only this, he referred to a picture on the front page of the New York Times with a picture of a Kashmiri woman who was written that the woman's son was bitten by a snake but could not get medical help in time and she died

 treepathi ne kaha ki is tarah ke gambhir ulanghan ke maamle aaj bhi saamne aate hai
 He also said that the Government of India has been making continuous efforts towards ensuring women empowerment and equality

 bird watching
 
 
 We used to use these words a lot during the college days
 tab chhichhorepan kaa nafaasat se izhaar karne kaa yahi tareeqa tha
 Then he came out of the college and came to the newspaper that one day he was asked to go to the reporting of bird watching camp
 indore ke sirpur talab janaa tha, saath main bheje gaye photographer abraar khan
 Abrar Bhai had come from Bhopal via Indore and after reaching Sirpur pond
 pataa chalaa ki unhen har ek parinde kaa naam pataa tha, vah kahaan andey dete hai, tarah-tarah ke parindon kii kya khaasiyat hai
 He knew well about all this
 us din ke baad lautaa to bird watching kaa asli matlab samaj aa gaya jo college ke jamaane se bahut alag or usase kahin zyada sukun dene vaala tha
 If Abrar brothers were sitting in the canteen of the college too, then they would keep their eyes on more than samosas
 kabhi-kabhi sochataa hum ki abraar bhai jis tarah or jitna parindon ko dekhte hai isse unki bivi bhi rashk karti hongi
 The addiction that Abrar Bhai took is still intact today
 haal hi main ek raat jab koharaa hawaaon main ghul rahaa tha
 Bharatpur then set out with four friends to go to Bird Sanctuary
 kohre kii vajah se ruk-ruk kar aakhirkaar bharatpur kii keoladev ghanaa bird sancturi pahunch hi gaye
 Desperate to look at the three cameras and the birds, we decided to leave the cycle and rickshaw on foot
 sancturi ke andar ek grey heron (bagule jaisaa dikhne vaala pakshi) nazar aayaa, pani ke andar machhlee ke intazaar main aise khadaa tha jaise lakdi kaa koi thunth ho
 There was water around him, but a sea of patience inside him
 dilli jaise shahar main har rose jam lagane par na jane kitne logon kaa dhairya tuutata he
 Sometimes it seems that as much as modern times are becoming, endurance is becoming less
 fast food ke shauqin bad rahe hai, lekin dhimi aanch main pake khaane kaa lajiz swaad bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 Some had gone ahead to see black-headed ibis (heron-like bird whose head was black and the rest of the body was white), then America remembered where the black-white gap is getting deeper, it was black and also blonde 
 sir se roosi khurchate hue sochaa ki rangabhed karne vaale bhi agar soche ki ise kis taraf rakhen to aise hi sir khujate der tak sochate rahenge
 Then a wood packer, called a woodpecker in the Hindi belt, was seen as a habit of people around him
 vah daraa nahin or maine bhi jeebhar kar uski tasviir khinchi
 Later a guide said that it is not the woodpecker but the hoopoe, which is called Hudhud
 isi ke nampar haal ke ek toofaan kaa naam rakhaa gaya, lekin hudahud apane maasoom vajood se koi bhi bavandar khadaa nahin karata
 Somewhere in the far end of the park, there were some colorful headlines that were called Brahmin shell duck
 iske pankh sone ke rang jaise hote hai, ye bade shaharon ke elite kii tarah aam parindon se dur park ke ek kinare par yun virajman the, jaise apane kisi form house main kuch chuninda parindon ke saath hon
 As the bird came out of the Sanctuary, we saw a pig, which came out of the tree rubbing itself
 moti chamadi vaala
 
 
 Like those around us, who are not influenced by the talk of the boss or critics, cool in themselves
 
 
 baaki post
 Saw lots of birds in Bharatpur, indigenous foreigners all in one place
 
 
 siyaar, nilgai, sambar, hiran or suar jaise jaanavar bhi dikhaai die
 The heart became a garden

 Staring at them, she could fly, but she would turn back and shine

 The BJP has taken a strong stand on the presidential election
 bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne kaha he ki raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar sushamaa swaraj ke vichaar party ke vichaar hai or is maamle main jald hi endie kii baithak bulaai jaani chahie
 a strong objection was raised to Sharad Yadav's statement in the BJP meeting on the matter
 baithak main yah faisla kiya gaya ki sharad yadav ko endie kii baithak bulaane ko kaha jayega
 It is worth mentioning that JDU president and NDA convenor Sharad Yadav had said, 'whatever Sushma Swaraj has said, this is the opinion of BJP
 yah hamaari party kii raay nahin he
 Sharad Yadav was reacting to a question about the statement of Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj, in which Sushma said that BJP Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Vice President Hamid Ansari or any candidate being presented for the President's post by Congress Will not support sushamaa swaraj ne yah bhi kaha tha ki agar samaajawaadee party jaise dal is pad ke liye purv raashtrapati apije abdul kalam ke naam ko aage badhaate hai, to unhen samarthan karne ke vichaar ke prati party kaa vikalp khulaa he
 Sharad Yadav had said that the NDA has not discussed any names of the presidential candidates
 jab bhi is tarah kii charchaa hogi jadyu apni raay rakhegi
 Sushma Swaraj has expressed her party's opinion
 sansad main sarkaar ko gherne ke liye vipaksh ne ranneeti banani shuru kar di he

 haalanki sabhi partiyaan is baat par sahamat hai ki van nesan van ellection sambhav nahin he, or yah thik bhi nahin he
 One leader even said that sometimes One Nation One Election, sometimes One Nation One Language is going to divide such things and our country is not like this
 is netaa ne kaha ki jis tareeke se desh main chunaav hote hai ek baar aapane van nesan van ellection karaayaa bhi to uske baad upachunaav bhi hote hai
 If any government falls, it will not be able to continue the process again
 isliye ise ladanaa thik nahin

 Shyamdev Rai Chaudhary, whom people fondly call as 'dada', this time BJP from South Varanasi seat has not given him a ticket and Nilkanth Tiwari, who is making his election debut in his place, has been made his candidate
 tikat nahin milane se naaraaz shyamdev raay choudhary ne kaha he ki vah dakshini varanasi seat se keval bijepi ke liye prachaar-prasar karenge naa ki ummidavaar nilkanth tiwari ke liye
 Chaudhary believes that he wanted to contest this time and it would have been his last election if he had been given a party ticket
 apana tikat katane se choudhary ko kaaphi niraashaa hui he
 BJP also realizes this, that's why national president Amit Shah also called Chaudhary to Lucknow earlier and assured him to give him a high position in the party
 choudhary ke anusaar amit shah ne bhi mana tha ki unka tikat katkar party ne bahut badi galati kii he
 Perhaps Prime Minister Narendra Modi also realized this mistake, so when he went to Kashi Vishwanath temple on Saturday during a road show, Shyamdev Rai Choudhary, who was present there, took him with him inside the temple

 BJP MLA Michael Lobo struck a deal between the protesters and the government
 san 2009 main likhe ek lekh main maine ummid jataai thi ki namvarji ke centuri banane ke din chiyar ap karne waalon kii bheed main main bhi shaamil hounga
 He left eight years ago, but not long, after living a big and full life
 beesvin sadi ke paanchaven dashak se aarambh hua namvarji kaa saahitiyik jivan uplabdhiyon se bharpoor rahaa or vivaadon se bhi
 The scope of his writing ranged from Prithviraj Raso to contemporary poetry, his knowledge was constantly refreshed, and expanded
 saath hi, gajab kii yaaddaasht or bhaashan-kala
 Speakers who practice academic seriousness, adorable style, and murderous satire are rare
 vicharottejak sthapanaayen ve lagaataar karte rahe, vivaadit vaktavy bhi kam nahin die
 He was not only the top critic of Hindi, but also the most popular public intellectual in the Hindi region
 mere liye namvar singh in sab varnanon ke pehle adhyaaapak the, guru the
 Were among the elders of the house
 ve mujhase kai baar naaraaz bhi hue, main bhi unki anek baton or gatividhiyon se chidhaa
 My relationship with me was not always in the same tone
 ek baat lekin sadaa sach rahiah unhone keval padhaayaa nahin, sikhaaya bhi
 Learned many things from Namvarji, which should be done, many which should not be done
 mere liye, ve har haal main sikhaane vaale rahe
 He was a critic, a critic of literature
 aalochana keval sahitya tak hi simit nahin he
 All philosophical thinking, spontaneity to change the situation arises from criticism
 namvarji lok-buddhijivi kii bhoomika bhi aalochana ke isi mahatv ke ehsaas ke saath nibhaate the, or sampadak kii bhi
 Sometimes his own role in his behavior was also denied
 lekin kul milakar ve apane man main spasht the ki 'sab apni-apni jagah thik' tip kaa meethaapan asal main bauddhik aalas hi nahin, aapangata kii soochna detaa he
 On the basic human paradigms, there is no option to judge and judge the various socio-political views and behaviors on the test of conscience
 san 1968 main prakashit kavita ke nae pratimaan is myne main namvarji kii aalochanatmak pratigya or paddati kaa mul vaktavy he
 The whole book underlines that the work of literary criticism is to give value-judgment by economizing the composition in front of it, value-judgment given while respecting the autonomy of the composition as well as its historical position
 is kitaab ke saath hi yaad karen, uttar aadhuniktaa kii dhoomdhaam ke dinon main diya gaya namvarji kaa yah vaktavy—1992 ke samaas (sampadakah ashok vaajapeyi) main prakashit lekh kachua dharm
 "now the scripture of literature has begun to declare its autonomy by freeing itself from literature
 sahityashastra kaa kaam ab yah bataanaa nahin rahaa ki kya sahitya he, or kya sahitya nahin he
 When something like 'literature' does not exist, then who wastes time in search of it? When there is 'text' and 'writing' here and there, only one work remains, that of Mimamsa or Vyaktya

 So what is 'literary criticism', just as the word 'criticism' has become popular
 "jaruri he yah samajhnaa ki aalochana shabd kaa chalan hi uth janaa keval saahitiyik hi nahin, saamaajik durghatana bhi he
 To understand this, it is not necessary to do much exercise, it is enough to look around
 chintit hona chahie us samaaj ko jahaan buddhijivi hona paap jaisaa maan liya jaae or sarkaar se sawaal karnaa deshadroh jaisaa
 From the very beginning, literary criticism of Hindi has been struggling for human values and economism based on them
 namvarji isi sangharsh kii ek kadi the
 There are many things to write
 chalis saal pehle main unke sampark main aayaa tha, em

 Not only for me, for every student of his, Namvarji's teacher form overshadows everyone else
 vishay kii gahari jaankaree, uske saath satat jigyaasa, class-room lectures main kamaal kaa vit, sawaalon ke prati khulaapan—ye chijen namvarji apane padhaane ke jariye sikhaate the
 Many people have different experiences about them at the individual level
 kai logon kaa kahana he ki kisi thihe par chaay-pani ityadi ke liye namvarji kaa haath kurte kii jeb main jaataa jarur tha, lekin waapas tabhi nikalataa tha, jab koi or paise de chukaa ho
 It happened to me that once we were returning from Ahmedabad, we were sitting in the lounge
 bole, ''purushottamji, kaaphi pi jaae" main turant uthakar khadaa hua, ''laata hum doyk sahib
 
 
 "put hand in pocket of kurta, gave money
 maine kaha, 'rahane dijie, doyk saab, main le aauungaa
 "" i know, you also earn, but i am the biggest one, take it quietly, and get coffee
 "shaayad, hamaumron ke saath unka bartaav alag hota tha, umr main chhoton ke saath alag
 In the last meeting, he said only Purushottamji, used to speak to everyone by putting 'ji'
 mujhe or suman ko to nahin, haa, hamaare bacchon ko yah saubhaahgya mila ki ve ruthvik or rutambhraa hi pukaare gaye, bina 'ji' lagaae
 Namvarji's contribution will be evaluated for his good and bad works outside of literature and beyond, it continued to happen during his lifetime
 sach to yah he ki vivaad unke sadaa ke sangi the
 And, it is also true that he was the last Acharya of Hindi in the true sense of the word
