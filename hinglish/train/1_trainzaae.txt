 The anti-romeo squad dominated the news immediately after this year's election results in Uttar Pradesh
 ye asal main police ke daste hai jo saarvajanik jagahon par tainaat kiye gaye hai, taaki mahilaon ke saath ''chhedchhad" yani yon utpeeda ko roak sake
 Although it can be analyzed only after some time that how effective these squads are, it is important to note at this time that violence against women and sexual harassment of women does not necessarily happen on the streets
 kai baar yah gharon kii charadivari ke bheetar bhi hota he
 Secondly, if you look at crime from a more comprehensive perspective, then dowry murders, domestic violence, sexual assault and acid attacks are of greater and growing concern
 rashtriya aparaadh record beuro ke aankadon (2015) ke mutabik, uttar pradesh main, jahaan desh bhar kii mahilaon kii kul 16
 8 per cent of the population lives, 35,527 cases i
e
 around 10 of the total crimes against women across the country
 9 fisadi aparaadh darj hue
 The formation of anti-romeo squads is an attack on the freedom of women in this way, because of this they have to disclose their relationship with a male friend who is traveling with them
 vah bhi tab jab hamaara samvidhan kisi bhi shaks kii nijee aazaadee or garima main dakhsandaji karne kii ijaajat kisi ko nahin detaa
 Therefore, the way these squads work is unconstitutional and violates the individual's personal freedom
 meri raay main anti-romeo daston kii puri dharna hi is vichaardhaara se nikali he ki auraton ko ek khaas dhang se bartaav karnaa hoga
 Patriarchalism appears to be in its worst form in Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan saarvajanik jagahon tak auraton kii pahunch or saath hi unke vikalp behad simit hai
 Such an environment creates fear not only in the heartbeat of women but also in their parents and in society on a much larger scale
 itnaa hi nahin, in police daston ko anti-romeo daste kahana uttar pradesh main gaddinshin party kii asamvedansheeltaa batalaata he
 This insensitivity is also towards that cultural and historical hero of Shakespearean literature, who was a symbol of love and could not marry his beloved due to issues of class and hostility
 in daston kaa gathan unheen takaton ke vistaar kii tarah lagata he jo velentine de or nae saal kii purvasandhya par auraton ke bal khinchati hai, lav jihad kaa virodh karne waalon kii to khayr baat hi chhod den
 In my opinion, this step will also increase corruption, as people will try to bribe police officers to avoid further embarrassment or family involvement
 is baat par jarur gaur karnaa chahie ki bhay paidaa karke badlaav nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 i would like to suggest that in order to build a healthy society and a culture of greater tolerance, we need to increase the role of society and political class
 netaaon ko gaiyr-jimmedaarana bayaan dene se roka janaa chahie or iske liye unki khinchaai kii jaani chahie
 The police should be fast and prompt while dealing with crimes against women
 mahakme main or zyada mahila police adhikari honi hi chahie
 At the same time, more intervening centers should be established throughout the country with outright solutions, and men should be counseled on issues related to sexuality
 hamen teji se or chusti se sajaa dilwane kaa pakkaa intjaam bhi karnaa chahie or mahilaon ke khilaaf vibhinn aparaadhon ko fast trek adaalaton main bheja janaa chahie
 In addition, women should be encouraged to report crimes with them, as the culture of perpetuating fear will be prevented
 hamen yah samajhnaa hoga ki anti-romeo daston kaa gathan mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaale aparaadhon kii zyada badi buraai ke prati behad tang najariye kii numaaindgi karata he
 This requires a multi-layered and multi-pronged strategy, involving a large number of stakeholders to deal effectively with the problem
 isliye yahi salaah di ja sakati he ki kanoon banane vaale or unhen lagu karne vaale is baat ko samajhen
 (strong advocate of women's rights ranjana kumari nai dilli sthit sanghathan centre for soshal research kii diarector hai) After Navratri Congress congressman Shahul Gandhi is once again visiting Rajasthan
 is baar rahul gandhi vasundhara raaje ke garh hadoti or shekhavati main 24 or 25 november ko rahenge
 During this time, Rahul Gandhi will hold a meeting on November 24 in Jhalawar, the constituency of Vasundhara Raje, and will do road shows in Kota and Bundi
 iske baad 25 november ko rahul gandhi sikar main sabha karenge

 The Congress wants to present Manvendra as a prize catch
 maanavendra ke karibiyon ne bataaya ki rahul gandhi ne unako (maanavendra) kaha ki daure par saath chalenge
 Significantly, there are a significant number of Rajput votes in Shekhawati and Hadoti, which have been traditional BJP voters
 shekhavati kaa mizaaj chunaav main alag hi rahata he
 Jhunjhunu, Sikar and Churu districts have been winning three seats from bspdo, while three seats have been placed second and third
 isi tarah marxvaadi communist party kaa vajood isi ilaake main ab bhi bachaa he
 The CPI (M) here wins one or two seats and sits third in several seats
 isi tarah se donirdaliabhi yahaan se jitate rahete hai
 This time the Congress is trying to consolidate the scattered votes in some way
 is shekhavati ilaake main jat, rajput, muslim or anusuchit jati ke voton kii sankhya kaaphi he
 At the same time, this time Congress had cleared in Hadoti
 kaha ja rahaa he ki kota, bundi, baaraa or jhalawad jile main congress is baar majbootee ke saath kambek kar sakati he
 It is believed that after Rahul Gandhi's visit, the first list of 80 Congress candidates may come on 26 November
 bataa den kirajasthan vidhansabha chunaavake liye 12 november ko adhisuchana jari hogi
 After this, the last date for filing nominations will be November 19

 The Railway (RRB, Railway) said on Wednesday that all the requirements related to the appointment of pwds have been met under the rules and are still trying to find ways to accommodate them, but the pwd protesters protesting at Mandi House Illegitimate demands cannot be met
 railway kii group-di (RRB Group D) kii naukariyon ke liye aavedan karne vaale pradarshnkaree divyang cote ke tahat naukari diye jane kii maang ko lekar buudhvaar ko ek baar phir mandi house par dharne par baith gaye, jisase madhya dilli main yatayaat prabhavit hua
 The Railways (railway, RRB) said that it has examined the list of 184 "pwd" candidates in the 10 railway zones submitted for consideration for jobs by the group, which found that no one scored the required 28 percent marks
 Have done
 railway board main sadsy, carmik, manoj pandey ne kaha ki railway ke pratinidhiyon ne pradarshnakariyon kii shikaayatein jaanane ke liye kai baar unke saath baithak kii
 One of the demands of the group is that the vacancies for different types of Divisions be merged
 unhone kaha ki mantralay kuch ''divyangjan'' ummidavaaron par vichaar kar rahaa he jinhone kaha he ki unhone anjaane main keval ek divyangta (mukhya rup se chalane-phirane se judi divyangta) ke liye aavedan kiya he, bhale hi vah kai shrenee ke tahat divyang hai
 He is therefore eligible for consideration under the multi-disability (MD) quota
 sansad ke bajet satr kaa doosraa bhaag aaj se shuru ho rahaa he
 Even in this session, the strong opposition of the opposition can plague the government
 neerav modi-pienbi ghotaalaa, karti chidambaram par sibiai kaa shikanja, meghalaya main bijepi sarkaar samet kai muddon par congress sarkaar ko gheregi
 But meanwhile, the government will try in this session to pass the stuck bills
 inamen teen bill aise hai jinpar puure desh kii nazar he
 1
 fujitive iconomic offender billis bill ko kendriya cabinet se haal hi main manjuuri mili he
 In the last few days, due to the manner in which scams related to banking sector have come to light, this bill matters a lot
 is bill ke tahat desh chhodkar jane vaale ko bhagoda ghotalebaj ghoshit kiya jayega
 This bill will be valid only in cases where the crime is more than Rs 100 crore
 bill ke tahat anusuchit aparaadhiyon kii pahchaan kii jaaegi
 The court can declare anyone a fugitive
 haalanki iske liye ghotaale kii seemaa 100 karod rupee se adhik honi chahie
 This will prevent big criminals
 bhagode vyakti kii sirf aparaadh dwaara arjeet kii hui sampatti hi nahin balki sari sampatti jabt kii ja sakegi
 At the moment, fugitives like Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya used to take advantage of the shortcomings of the law and it takes a lot of time to take action against them once they escape abroad
 nae kanoon se yah prakriya tej ho sakegi
 2
 kya rajyasabha main paas hoga teen talaak bill?bahucharchit teen talaak bill ko loksabhaa se to manjuuri mil gai thi, lekin rajyasabha main yah bill atak gaya tha
 The triple talaq bill had been a big issue during the winter session, but the bill was stuck in the Rajya Sabha due to some objections from the opposition, including the Congress
 bijepi ne congress par doharaa ravaiya apnaane kaa aarope lagaaya tha, kyonki congress ne loksabhaa main to bill kaa samarthan kiya or rajyasabha main virodh
 In fact, most of the parties say that they are against sending a husband to jail for 3 years in the event of three divorces
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki agar jail bheje jane kaa dar khatm ho jaae to phir is kanoon kaa koi matlab hi nahin rah jayega
 3
 obisi ayog ko sanvaidhanik darjasarkaar ke liye do bade bilon ke alaava obisi ayog ko sanvaidhanik darja dilwane vaala vidheyak bhi paas karwaanaa behad jaruri he
 The bill has also been stuck since the winter session
 ye bill loksabhaa main paas ho chukaa he, bas rajyasabha main paas hona baaki he
 The opposition had alleged that the government was taking away the rights of the states through this, but the government has rejected these allegations
 spikar sumitra mahajan ji, ek news ankar hone ke naate aaj aapaki pidaa ko bhi samaj rahaa tha or aapaki chunauti ko bhi
 The eyes of the country were on your side, that you are not leaning towards those who were ever on your own or towards those who would be looking at you with suspicion
 ghamaasan bahes main jab aarope tir kii tarah idhar se udhar chal rahe the aapane apana kaam bakhubi sambhala
 We can guess that today will be a memorable day for you too
 meri taraf se aapako badhai
 Big Thanks Mam in English
 pradhanmantri modi sadan main nahin the lekin loksabhaa main na hona unhen bhi khala hoga
 Thinking how an active politician like him would have kept himself away from today's debate is both tense and thrilling
 afsos unhen bhi hona chahie jinhone loksabhaa kii bahes nahin dekhi
 The tension and fatigue of this issue was visible on Sushma Swaraj's face
 khud ko na samajhe jane kii bebasii, dusron ko samajha dene kii bechaini unhen aaj yuddh jaise morche ke bich le gai
 At a time when you have to be ruthless against him while attacking, with which a kind of political etiquette is formed
 buudhvaar kii bahes main ye tamaam rishte dharashaayi hone lage
 There was an attack on each other's families
 sansad na chalane se apane kilaaf banate jan dabaav ke kaaran congress ko bhi bahes ke liye raji hona padaa
 The resignation condition which was not being debated was also debated and the resignation was not done
 sansad daanv par lagaakar sarkaar ne vipaksh ko hi hataash kar diya
 Generally, the opposition frustrates the government
 subah bahes ke liye congress se haath jod kar apil karne vaale sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu bahes puri hote hi congress ko gherne lage
 i was ashamed to hear the Latifah and counted it with a name
 karnataka ke gulburg se duusari baar saansad bane, das baar lagaataar vidhansabha chunaav jite 73 saal ke mapanna mallikarjun khadge kaa bhi kaaphi kuch daanv par laga tha
 Born in a simple Dalit family, Kharge had the responsibility to surround a veteran and fast-paced leader like Vidisha MP Sushma Swaraj
 apni chhitakati sanbhalti hindi ke zariye khadge ne saat aath sawaal puche
 - The first question asked why the government is not issuing letters with Britain
 - doosraa sawaal ki bhartiya ucchayog se sampark kii salaah kyon nahin di lalit modi ko
 - Third question, why did Lalit Modi not insist on coming to India first
 - chauthaa sawaal ki hai court main passport kaa cese haarane par sarkaar ne supreme court main apil kyon nahin kii
 Whose decision was it not to appeal
 - paanchavaa sawaal ki lalit modi ko lambey samay kaa visa yaa residency permit kaise diya gaya
 - Sixth question what steps should be taken in the matter of issuing a new passport
 - or saatvaan ki lalit modi kehete hai ki ve suraksha kaarnon se bharat nahin ja rahe hai to kya bharat sarkaar unki suraksha nahin kar sakati he
 Kharge said that Sushma Swaraj herself has admitted the mistake, so we ask for her resignation
 kyon kaha ki agar lalit modi ko dastauez milte hai to bharat britain ke sambandhon par asar nahin padegaa
 a little uproar ensued when Kharge also dragged Vasundhara Raje into the matter as to why he had given the necessary documents by hiding from the Government of India to settle Lalit Modi
 sansad main mukhyamantri kaa naam nahin liya jaataa he, rajya ke mukhyamantri ke bare main charchaa nahin ho sakati he isliye unhen manaa kiya gaya
 But in some context, reference to Vasundhara continued
 sadan kii sadsy hoti to jawaab miltaa ki aise kisi gupt dastauez par dastakhat kiya he yaa nahin
 It was Sushma Swaraj's turn to answer
 unka bhaashan bhi kam dhuandhar nahin tha
 Sushma Swaraj said that it is not my fault
 aisi mahila kii madad karnaa jo bharat kii naagarik he, jo 17 varshon se cancer se grast he, jo kisi aparaadh main lipt nahin he, uski madad karnaa gunaah he, main ye gunaah kabool karti hum
 The question before me was that "if the British government decides to give him the travel documents, will the relationship between the two countries deteriorate? i sent a verbal message that the British government applied Lalit Modi according to his rules Can consider agar british sarkaar yatra dastauez dene kaa faisla karti he to hamaare sambandh kharaab nahin honge
 So, this is not the issue
 sawaal uth rahe the ki kya videsh mantri ne is maukhik aadesh kii jaankaree mantralay main kisi ko di, iskaa jawaab nahin mila
 The question arose that if Lalit Modi was helped, then in response it was said that his wife is an Indian citizen, he was helped and this is a crime
 iske baad sushamaa swaraj kaa bhaashan doosraa mode letaa he
 First, she clarifies about her husband and daughter that she is not involved in the case related to Lalit Modi from anywhere
 ye hiton kaa takaraav nahin he
 The conflict of interest is when p Chidambaram is the Finance Minister and his wife Nalini Chidambaram is appointed as a lawyer on behalf of her own department, Income Tax
 jab rajya sabha main maamla uthaa to chidambaram sahab ne jawaab diya ki unki jaankaree main nahin hua
 Chidambaram acquitted himself by himself
 iske baad sushamaa swaraj ne rahul gandhi ko nishane par liya ki rahul bolte hai ki ek apradhi kii madad kii
 i ask you - tell me what Sushma Swaraj signed and gave to Lalit Modi
 rahul gandhi kehete hai ki sushamaa ji ne jo kaam kiya he wo chup chup ke kiya he
 If you did it secretly, then you did the work to drive away Quattrocchi
 agar chup chup ke koi kaam kiya to rajeev gandhi kii sarkaar main anderson ko bhagane kaa kaam chup chup ke kiya
 And i am not saying from my side, this is his own Chief Minister's book
 arjuna singh ji kii autobiography
 Arjun Singh was not only the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, he was in the same position that Rahul Gandhi is today
 congress ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh the
 The mother-son president was not the vice president at that time
 koi or vyakti hota tha
 It was equal to that the Congress was stunned
 hamaari raajnneeti kii yahi khubi he
 The mistake of one gets the curtain from the fault of the other
 sushamaa ke is hamale ne rahul gandhi ko bhi bolne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 The comments rahul gandhi ne kaha ki kal sushamaa ji ne meraa haath pakadaa or kaha ki betaa tum mere se gussa kyon ho
 What have i done to you maine sushamaa ji se kaha ki maine aapse gussa nahin kiya he
 look up to you
 sushamaa ji main satya bol rahaa hum to aapane ankhen neeche kar leen
 Why did you turn your eyes down? pradhanmantri main saahas nahin he ki ve sadan main aakar sach dekhen, sune or kahen
 Everyone does the work of humanity but Sushma ji is the only one in the world who does this work in secret
 sushamaa ji ne gandhi parivaar par hamalaa na bolaa hota to shaayad rahul gandhi haath pakad kar betaa kehane vaali baat na bataate
 Arun Jaitley later elaborated in the Shanti Sadan the legal aspect of Lalit Modi's case and dismissed the demand for resignation
 galakat bhaashanon ke bich bhavanaaen aise chadh utar rahi thi ki koi mudda hi na ho
 The accounts of each other's clans were accounted for and a description of their strengths
 aisi ghamaasan raajnneeti se to kisi kaa dil ghabara jaae magar yakeenan hamaare rajanetaaon ko aaz bahut mazaa aayaa hoga
 Prime Minister Modi was not in the House but he would also be upset if he is not in the Lok Sabha
 unke jaise sakriy rajaneta ne aaj kii bahes se khud ko kaise dur rakhaa hoga yah soch kar tanaav or romaanch donon hota he
 Sadly, it should be those who have not seen the Lok Sabha debate
 is masale kaa tanaav or thakaan sushamaa swaraj ke chehre par dikh rahaa tha
 The helplessness of not understanding himself, the uneasiness of explaining to others took him today in the midst of war-like front
 ek aise vakt main jab aapako hamalaa karte vakt uske khilaaf bhi nirmam hona padataa he jiske saath ek kism kaa raajnneetik shishtachar ban jaataa he
 In Wednesday's debate, all these relationships started to fade
 ek duusare ke pariwaron par hamale hone lage
 The Congress also had to agree to the debate due to the public pressure created against it due to non-running of Parliament
 jis istife kii shart par bahes nahin ho rahi thi wo bahes bhi hui or istipha bhi nahin hua
 The government frustrated the opposition by putting Parliament at stake
 aam taur par vipaksh sarkaar ko hataash kar diya karata he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu, who joined hands with the Congress for a debate in the morning, began to surround the Congress as soon as the debate was over
 latifa sunaakar lajaaya to naam le lekar ginaya
 Became MP for the second time from Gulbarga in Karnataka, 73-year-old Mapanna Mallikarjun Kharge, who won ten consecutive assembly elections, was also at stake
 saadhaaran se dalit parivaar main janme khadge par zimmedaari thi vidisha kii saansad sushamaa swaraj jaisi anbhavi or tej tarraar netaa ko gherne kii
 Through his spontaneous Hindi, Kharge asked seven to eight questions
 - pehla sawaal poocha ki britain ke saath khato-kitabat ko jari kyon nahin kar rahi sarkaar
 - Second question, why did Lalit Modi not be advised to contact the Indian High Commission
 - teesraa sawaal lalit modi ko pehle bharat aane par jor kyon nahin diya
 - Fourth question why the government did not appeal to the Supreme Court if the passport case was lost in the High Court
 apil na karne kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 - Fifth question how Lalit Modi was given a long-term visa or residency permit
 - chatha sawaal nayaa passport jari karne ke maamle main kya kadam uthaae
 - And the seventh is that Lalit Modi says that if he is not going to India for security reasons, then the Indian government cannot protect him
 khadge ne kaha ki sushamaa swaraj ne khud galati maani he isliye ham unka istipha maangate hai
 Why said that if Lalit Modi gets the documents then india-uk relations will not be affected
 thodaa hangaamaa tab hua jab khadge is maamle main vasundhara raaje ko bhi ghaseetne lage ki lalit modi ko basane ke liye bharat sarkaar se chipa kar zaruri dastauez kyon diye
 The name of the Chief Minister is not taken in the Parliament, the Chief Minister of the state cannot be discussed, so he was denied
 magar kisi na kisi sandarbh main vasundhara kaa sandarbh aata hi rahaa
 Would have been a member of the House, the answer would have been whether any such secret document was signed or not
 jawaab dene kii baari sushamaa swaraj kii thi
 His speech was no less blunt
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki meri koi galati nahin he
 It is a crime to help a woman who is a citizen of India, who has been suffering from cancer for 17 years, who is not involved in any crime, i confess this crime
 mere saamne vichaaradhin yahi tha ki "agar british sarkaar usko yatra dastauez de detii he, dene kaa faisla kar leti he to kya ham donon deshon ke rishte kharaab honge? us par maine maukhik sandesh bhijwaya ki british sarkaar apane niyamon ke anusaar lalit modi kii arzi par vichaar kar sakati he
 If the British government decides to give a travel document, our relations will not deteriorate
 isliye ye mudda hi nahin he
 Questions were arising as to whether the foreign minister gave information about this oral order to anyone in the ministry, it could not be answered
 sawaal uthaa ki lalit modi kii madad kii gai to jawaab main kaha gaya ki unki patni ek bhartiya naagarik hai unki madad hui or ye gunaah he to kabool he
 After this Sushma Swaraj's speech takes another turn
 pehle apane pati or beti ke bare main safai detii hai ki ve kahin se bhi lalit modi se jude maamle main shaamil nahin hai
 This is not a conflict of interest
 hiton kaa takaraav to wo he jab pi chidambaram vitt mantri hote hai or unki patni nalini chidambaram ko unke apane vibhaag inakam tex kii taraf se vakil niyukt kiya jaataa he
 When the matter arose in the Rajya Sabha, Chidambaram sahib replied that he was not aware
 chidambaram ne khud se hi khud ko bari kar liya
 After this, Sushma Swaraj targeted Rahul Gandhi that Rahul speaks that he helped a criminal
 main aapse puuchhati hum - bataaie sushamaa swaraj ne lalit modi kaa kya sin karke de diya
 Rahul Gandhi says that the work that Sushma has done has been done in secret
 agar chup chup ke kiya to kwatroki ko bhagane kaa kaam tumne kiya
 If he did any work in secret, then in Rajiv Gandhi's government, he did the work of driving away Anderson
 or main apni ore se nahin kah rahi, ye inke apane mukhyamantri kii kitaab he
 Autobiography of Arjun Singh ji
 arjuna singh keval mukhyamantri nahin the madhya pradesh ke, usee pad par the jis par aaj rahul gandhi hai
 Was the National Vice President of Congress
 us samay maa-betaa adhyaksh upaadhyaksh nahin hote the
 There used to be some other person
 aisa iz ikval tu kiya ki congress sann rah gai
 This is the specialty of our politics
 ek kii galati ko duusare kii galati se pardaa mil jaataa he
 Sushma's attack also forced Rahul Gandhi to speak
 tippaniyan Rahul Gandhi said that Sushma ji held my hand yesterday and said why are you angry with me, son
 maine tumhaara kya kiya he
 i told Sushma ji that i did not get angry with you
 aapkaa aadar karata hum
 Sushma ji, i am speaking the truth, so you closed your eyes
 aapane ankhen neeche kyon kar leen
 The Prime Minister does not have the courage to come to the House to see, hear and say the truth
 maanavtaa kaa kaam sab karte hai magar sushamaa ji duniya main akeli hai jo ye kaam chup kar karti hai
 If Sushma ji would not have attacked the Gandhi family, Rahul Gandhi might not have been holding his hand and telling the son
 baad main arun jetali ne shant sadan main vistaar se lalit modi ke maamle kaa kanoonee pahalu bataaya or istife kii maang ko khaarij kiya
 Emotions were rising in such a way that there should be no issue at all
 ek duusare ke khandaanon kaa hisaab hua or apni khoobiyon kaa bakhaan
 Somebody's heart may get scared due to such fierce politics but surely our politicians must have enjoyed it a lot
 is masale kaa tanaav or thakaan sushamaa swaraj ke chehre par dikh rahaa tha
 The helplessness of not understanding himself, the uneasiness of explaining to others took him today in the midst of war-like front
 ek aise vakt main jab aapako hamalaa karte vakt uske khilaaf bhi nirmam hona padataa he jiske saath ek kism kaa raajnneetik shishtachar ban jaataa he

 sansad main mukhyamantri kaa naam nahin liya jaataa he, rajya ke mukhyamantri ke bare main charchaa nahin ho sakati he isliye unhen manaa kiya gaya
 But in some context, reference to Vasundhara continued
 sadan kii sadsy hoti to jawaab miltaa ki aise kisi gupt dastauez par dastakhat kiya he yaa nahin
 It was Sushma Swaraj's turn to answer
 unka bhaashan bhi kam dhuandhar nahin tha
 Sushma Swaraj said that it is not my fault
 aisi mahila kii madad karnaa jo bharat kii naagarik he, jo 17 varshon se cancer se grast he, jo kisi aparaadh main lipt nahin he, uski madad karnaa gunaah he, main ye gunaah kabool karti hum
 The question before me was that "if the British government decides to give him the travel documents, will the relationship between the two countries deteriorate? i sent a verbal message that the British government applied Lalit Modi according to his rules Can consider agar british sarkaar yatra dastauez dene kaa faisla karti he to hamaare sambandh kharaab nahin honge
 So, this is not the issue
 sawaal uth rahe the ki kya videsh mantri ne is maukhik aadesh kii jaankaree mantralay main kisi ko di, iskaa jawaab nahin mila
 The question arose that if Lalit Modi was helped, then in response it was said that his wife is an Indian citizen, he was helped and this is a crime
 iske baad sushamaa swaraj kaa bhaashan doosraa mode letaa he
 First, she clarifies about her husband and daughter that she is not involved in the case related to Lalit Modi from anywhere
 ye hiton kaa takaraav nahin he
 The conflict of interest is when p Chidambaram is the Finance Minister and his wife Nalini Chidambaram is appointed as a lawyer on behalf of her own department, Income Tax
 jab rajya sabha main maamla uthaa to chidambaram sahab ne jawaab diya ki unki jaankaree main nahin hua
 Chidambaram acquitted himself by himself
 iske baad sushamaa swaraj ne rahul gandhi ko nishane par liya ki rahul bolte hai ki ek apradhi kii madad kii
 i ask you - tell me what Sushma Swaraj signed and gave to Lalit Modi
 rahul gandhi kehete hai ki sushamaa ji ne jo kaam kiya he wo chup chup ke kiya he
 If you did it secretly, then you did the work to drive away Quattrocchi
 agar chup chup ke koi kaam kiya to rajeev gandhi kii sarkaar main anderson ko bhagane kaa kaam chup chup ke kiya
 And i am not saying from my side, this is his own Chief Minister's book
 arjuna singh ji kii autobiography
 Arjun Singh was not only the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, he was in the same position that Rahul Gandhi is today
 congress ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh the
 The mother-son president was not the vice president at that time
 koi or vyakti hota tha
 It was equal to that the Congress was stunned
 hamaari raajnneeti kii yahi khubi he
 The mistake of one gets the curtain from the fault of the other
 sushamaa ke is hamale ne rahul gandhi ko bhi bolne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 The comments rahul gandhi ne kaha ki kal sushamaa ji ne meraa haath pakadaa or kaha ki betaa tum mere se gussa kyon ho
 What have i done to you maine sushamaa ji se kaha ki maine aapse gussa nahin kiya he
 look up to you
 sushamaa ji main satya bol rahaa hum to aapane ankhen neeche kar leen
 Why did you turn your eyes down? pradhanmantri main saahas nahin he ki ve sadan main aakar sach dekhen, sune or kahen
 Everyone does the work of humanity but Sushma ji is the only one in the world who does this work in secret
 sushamaa ji ne gandhi parivaar par hamalaa na bolaa hota to shaayad rahul gandhi haath pakad kar betaa kehane vaali baat na bataate
 Arun Jaitley later elaborated in the Shanti Sadan the legal aspect of Lalit Modi's case and dismissed the demand for resignation
 galakat bhaashanon ke bich bhavanaaen aise chadh utar rahi thi ki koi mudda hi na ho
 The accounts of each other's clans were accounted for and a description of their strengths
 aisi ghamaasan raajnneeti se to kisi kaa dil ghabara jaae magar yakeenan hamaare rajanetaaon ko aaz bahut mazaa aayaa hoga
 Became MP for the second time from Gulbarga in Karnataka, 73-year-old Mapanna Mallikarjun Kharge, who won ten consecutive assembly elections, was also at stake
 saadhaaran se dalit parivaar main janme khadge par zimmedaari thi vidisha kii saansad sushamaa swaraj jaisi anbhavi or tej tarraar netaa ko gherne kii
 Through his spontaneous Hindi, Kharge asked seven to eight questions
 - pehla sawaal poocha ki britain ke saath khato-kitabat ko jari kyon nahin kar rahi sarkaar
 - Second question, why did Lalit Modi not be advised to contact the Indian High Commission
 - teesraa sawaal lalit modi ko pehle bharat aane par jor kyon nahin diya
 - Fourth question why the government did not appeal to the Supreme Court if the passport case was lost in the High Court
 apil na karne kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 - Fifth question how Lalit Modi was given a long-term visa or residency permit
 - chatha sawaal nayaa passport jari karne ke maamle main kya kadam uthaae
 - And the seventh is that Lalit Modi says that if he is not going to India for security reasons, then the Indian government cannot protect him
 khadge ne kaha ki sushamaa swaraj ne khud galati maani he isliye ham unka istipha maangate hai
 Why said that if Lalit Modi gets the documents then india-uk relations will not be affected
 thodaa hangaamaa tab hua jab khadge is maamle main vasundhara raaje ko bhi ghaseetne lage ki lalit modi ko basane ke liye bharat sarkaar se chipa kar zaruri dastauez kyon diye
 The name of the Chief Minister is not taken in the Parliament, the Chief Minister of the state cannot be discussed, so he was denied
 magar kisi na kisi sandarbh main vasundhara kaa sandarbh aata hi rahaa
 Would have been a member of the House, the answer would have been whether any such secret document was signed or not
 jawaab dene kii baari sushamaa swaraj kii thi
 His speech was no less blunt
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki meri koi galati nahin he
 It is a crime to help a woman who is a citizen of India, who has been suffering from cancer for 17 years, who is not involved in any crime, i confess this crime
 mere saamne vichaaradhin yahi tha ki "agar british sarkaar usko yatra dastauez de detii he, dene kaa faisla kar leti he to kya ham donon deshon ke rishte kharaab honge? us par maine maukhik sandesh bhijwaya ki british sarkaar apane niyamon ke anusaar lalit modi kii arzi par vichaar kar sakati he
 If the British government decides to give a travel document, our relations will not deteriorate
 isliye ye mudda hi nahin he
 Questions were arising as to whether the foreign minister gave information about this oral order to anyone in the ministry, it could not be answered
 sawaal uthaa ki lalit modi kii madad kii gai to jawaab main kaha gaya ki unki patni ek bhartiya naagarik hai unki madad hui or ye gunaah he to kabool he
 After this Sushma Swaraj's speech takes another turn
 pehle apane pati or beti ke bare main safai detii hai ki ve kahin se bhi lalit modi se jude maamle main shaamil nahin hai
 This is not a conflict of interest
 hiton kaa takaraav to wo he jab pi chidambaram vitt mantri hote hai or unki patni nalini chidambaram ko unke apane vibhaag inakam tex kii taraf se vakil niyukt kiya jaataa he
 When the matter arose in the Rajya Sabha, Chidambaram sahib replied that he was not aware
 chidambaram ne khud se hi khud ko bari kar liya
 After this, Sushma Swaraj targeted Rahul Gandhi that Rahul speaks that he helped a criminal
 main aapse puuchhati hum - bataaie sushamaa swaraj ne lalit modi kaa kya sin karke de diya
 Rahul Gandhi says that the work that Sushma has done has been done in secret
 agar chup chup ke kiya to kwatroki ko bhagane kaa kaam tumne kiya
 If he did any work in secret, then in Rajiv Gandhi's government, he did the work of driving away Anderson
 or main apni ore se nahin kah rahi, ye inke apane mukhyamantri kii kitaab he
 Autobiography of Arjun Singh ji
 arjuna singh keval mukhyamantri nahin the madhya pradesh ke, usee pad par the jis par aaj rahul gandhi hai

 There used to be some other person
 aisa iz ikval tu kiya ki congress sann rah gai
 This is the specialty of our politics
 ek kii galati ko duusare kii galati se pardaa mil jaataa he
 Sushma's attack also forced Rahul Gandhi to speak
 tippaniyan Rahul Gandhi said that Sushma ji held my hand yesterday and said why are you angry with me, son
 maine tumhaara kya kiya he
 i told Sushma ji that i did not get angry with you
 aapkaa aadar karata hum
 Sushma ji, i am speaking the truth, so you closed your eyes
 aapane ankhen neeche kyon kar leen
 The Prime Minister does not have the courage to come to the House to see, hear and say the truth
 maanavtaa kaa kaam sab karte hai magar sushamaa ji duniya main akeli hai jo ye kaam chup kar karti hai
 If Sushma ji would not have attacked the Gandhi family, Rahul Gandhi might not have been holding his hand and telling the son
 baad main arun jetali ne shant sadan main vistaar se lalit modi ke maamle kaa kanoonee pahalu bataaya or istife kii maang ko khaarij kiya
 Emotions were rising in such a way that there should be no issue at all
 ek duusare ke khandaanon kaa hisaab hua or apni khoobiyon kaa bakhaan
 Somebody's heart may get scared due to such fierce politics but surely our politicians must have enjoyed it a lot

 rahul gandhi kehete hai ki sushamaa ji ne jo kaam kiya he wo chup chup ke kiya he

 After this, Sushma Swaraj targeted Rahul Gandhi that Rahul speaks that he helped a criminal
 main aapse puuchhati hum - bataaie sushamaa swaraj ne lalit modi kaa kya sin karke de diya
 Rahul Gandhi says that the work that Sushma has done has been done in secret

 college kaa pehla maheenaa kisi bhi fressure ke liye khaas hota he lekin dilli ke kuch bacchon ke liye ye nayaa safar sirf unke liye hi nahin, unke parivaar ke liye bhi kaaphi ahmiyat rakhata he
 This is because, to a degree, his family has put everything at stake
 grajuation kii seedhi par pehla kadam rakhane vaale in bacchon ke mata-pita mazdooree karke apana or apane parivaar kaa pet bharte hai
 But in front of the passion to study from a reputable college, all the problems seem small
 enditivi ne aise hi 30 college chaatro se mulaakaat kii jo apni college kii padhai ke saath saath apni fees kii jugad ke liye part time naukari bhi kar rahe hai
 Some work as a clerk in the embassy, some serve food in restaurants and then these youngsters can fulfill their dreams of studying in the best college like Lady Shri Ram
 in tees chaatro main se kisi ke bhi ghar shauchalay nahin he, yahi nahin pani or bijli kaa bhi aana kam or janaa zyada laga rahata he
 Saranya, who studies at Jesus and Mary College, tells of her home in frigid English, 'our house only gets water once an week for an hour
 isliye hamen bas baltiyaan le lekar daudna padataa he
 That day i missed my class because water could come anytime
 ' jahaan tak class main padhane vaale amir bacchon kii baat he to sanya kaa kahana he ki shuruyaat main unhen lagata tha ki log is bare main sochate honge lekin ab unhen nahin lagata ki kisi ko koi fark padataa he
 Chandan, who is studying in Venkateswara College, says that earlier, no one in the college talked to him because of his surroundings, but when he topped up, all of them automatically drew towards him
 chandan or saranya jaise kai bacchon ke sapanom ko aashaa jaise enjio sach karne main lage hai lekin in sabake bich kai parivaar bhi aise hai jinhen apane bachche kii behatar shiksha ke liye manaa paanaa mushkil kaam he
 The comments jaise rekha jinke abhibhavak aaj tak unhen college bhejne ke paksh main nahin hai
 Talking about her struggle, Rekha says' people don't understand why i want to go to college
 mere maa-baap raji nahin he lekin mujhe fark nahin padataa
 'rekha teaches younger children with her brother so that she can juggle her tuition fees of ten thousand rupees
 khaas baat ye he ki in chaatro ke yahi sangharsh inhen aage badhane ke liye prerit bhi karte hai jaise deepak jinhone us lamhe kaa zikr kiya jab unhone kuch kar dikhaane kii thaan lee thi 'mere papa thela lagaate hai or ek din police vaala unhen tang karne aa gaya
 Dad had only 100 rupees and if he had given this money to the police, we would not have had dinner
 pulisavaale ne papa ko thappad maaraa, bas usee din maine tay kar liya ki mujhe kuch banakar dikhaanaa he

 us din maine apni class miss kar di kyonki pani kabhi bhi aa saktaa tha
 As far as the rich children studying in class are concerned, Sanya says that in the beginning she thought that people must have thought about it but now she does not think that anybody makes any difference
 vahiin venkateshwar college main padhane vaale chandan bataate hai ki pehle pahal unke parivesh kii vajah se college main koi unase baat nahin karata tha lekin jab unhone top kiya to apane aap hi sab unki taraf khinche chale aae
 ngos like Asha are trying to make the dreams of many children like Chandan and Saranya come true, but among them there are many families who are finding it difficult to convince their child for better education
 tippaniyan Like Rekha whose parents are not in favor of sending her to college till date
 apane sangharsh ke bare main baat karte hue rekha kahati hai 'logon ko samaj nahin aata ki main college kyon janaa chaahati hum
 My parents are not happy but i don't care
 ' rekha apane bhai ke saath chote bacchon ko padhaati hai taaki vah apni das hazaar rupye kii tution fees kaa jugad kar sake
 The special thing is that these struggles of these students also motivate them to move forward like Deepak who mentioned the moment when he was determined to do something, 'my father hangs the cart and one day the police will harass him have arrived
 papa ke paas sirf 100 rupye the or agar wo ye paise police ko de dete to ham raat kaa khaanaa nahin kha pate
 The policeman slapped the father, just that very day i decided that i had to show me something

 The JDU has now questioned Tejashwi Yadav, the younger son of former Deputy Chief Minister and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, that when people in the government have made the details of their assets public, then Tejashwi Yadav as leader of the opposition Why not make the details of his assets public? Senior JDU leader and spokesperson Sanjay Singh has asked the question that in public life Why does Tejashwi refrain from transparent politics despite living? Sanjay Singh said that Kiteshvi Yadav should give details of his wealth because the public also wants to see how much the leader who has been accused of corruption is his real income or how much black money he has collected? On January 3, Lalu Prasad Yadav After being convicted in the scam case, a decision on his sentence has to come and in view of this, JDU has said that the family judiciary will always have caste Sees Me

 When Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was made Congress general secretary and in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, opposition leaders including the Bharatiya Janata Party are constantly attacking her
 23 janvari ko priyanka ke mahasachiv banaae jane ke baad se majah teen din ke andar kai bhaajapa netaa unhen lekar vivaadit bayaan de chuke hai
 BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, who made headlines with his controversial statements, made a controversial comment on Priyanka on 26 January
 unhone kaha ki gandhi parivaar chocolati chehron ke boote loksabhaa chunaav ladanaa chaahati he
 Vijayvargiya's' Chalkleti 'warvijayvargiya said,' Whenever a Congress leader demands that Kareena Kapoor be contested in the Lok Sabha elections from Bhopal, sometimes the name of Salman Khan is discussed about the election candidature from Indore
 isi tarah, priyanka ko congress kii sakriy raajnneeti main le aayaa jaataa he
 'he said,' Congress does not have strong leaders to contest the next Lok Sabha elections
 isliye vah aise chocolati chehron ke madhyam se chunaav ladanaa chaahati he
 If the Congress had confidence in Rahul's leadership, Priyanka would not have been brought into active politics

 unhone bijepi netaa or mantri smriti irani ko priyanka gandhi se zyada sundar bataaya he

 iske alaava, priyanka ko unke pati robert wadra ke pratinidhi ke rup main dekha jayega, jinke naam par bade paimaane par ghotaale hue hai

 iske kaaran nigam ke tahat chalane vaale sarkari skool or aspataal main kaam thap padaa he
 Garbage is being spread on the streets
 kahin doctor to kahin safai karmchaaree to kahin prashasnic karmchaaree alag-alag jagahon par dharna pradarshan karte rahe
 If someone is coming to someone's house and throwing garbage, then someone is also demanding from the Delhi government that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi be reunited
 sanyukt karmchaaree front ke adhyaksh rajesh mishra ne kaha he ki jab tak teenon nagar nigam ek nahin honge tab tak hadtaal chalegi
 Due to this strike which has been going on for eight days, the common people must have been suffering, it is also important that the people who depend on employees and pension will not get the money, then how will they meet their expenses
 aap sabakaa dukh or sukh pataa laga sakate hai magar yah nahin pataa laga sakate ki is sthiti ke liye koun zimmedaar he
 From the language of the people involved in this debate, you can guess that political opposition comes out first, then later the fact that justifies that protest seems to be coming out according to their own
 aisa lagata he ki bharamaane kii hode machi he
 Both sides are misleading with their own facts in such a way that it is difficult to reach the facts
 abhi tak centre banaam dilli kii is ladaai main yahi ahsaas karaayaa jaataa tha ki dilli ke paas koi adhikaar nahin he
 During the ongoing hearing in another case, the Urban Development Ministry has said in its affidavit that the three corporations fall under the Delhi government
 ab kya iskaa yah matlab nikaala jaae ki leftinent garvanar mukhiya ke naate emsidi ke liye zimmedaar hai
 But the Delhi government, which challenged LG, does not have the chance to take a decision and exercise its authority without asking LG
 dilli sarkaar ne kaha ki emsidi kamishnar kii niyukti se lekar nigam ko bhang karne kaa adhikaar centre ke paas he
 In Bengaluru, Chief Minister Kejriwal said that under Section 486 of the Delhi Municipal Act, the Delhi government can investigate the MCD, but when the government asked to show the account, the MCD refused
 kejariwal ne poocha ki emsidi ko parking, hording or houseing tex ke jo karodon rupee milte hai, uskaa hisaab kyon nahin diya ja rahaa he
 Where is that money going unki sarkaar ne is saal emsidi ko 100 karod zyada die hai
 Where did these 100 crores go? unki apni sarkaar ne north emsidi main 300 karod or east emsidi main 76 karod kii recovery kii he
 Where did this money go kejariwal ne kaha ki 31 disambar tak kaa paisa de diya gaya tha, phir bhi 27 janvari se karmchaaree hadtaal par kyon gaye
 MCD needs 690 crores till 31 January out of which we are giving a loan of 550 crores
 jab paise dene kii baat aati he to kehete hai dilli sarkaar de or hangaamaa karne ke vakt dilli centreshasit rajya ban jaataa he
 Arvind Kejriwal said that the doctors have written that the Delhi government should take the hospitals of MCD
 ve emsidi ke saath nahin rahanaa chaahate hai
 19 unions have written that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi be dissolved
 kejariwal ne maang kii ki emsidi kii sibiai jaanch honi chahie
 In response, the mayors of the Eastern and Northern MCD stated that sibiai kii jaanch ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin unke saath saath kejariwal sarkaar, mantri or vidhayakon kii bhi sibiai jaanch honi chahie
 This is called politics of deception
 itnaa bharamaa do ki pataa hi na chale ki masalaa kya tha
 The Mayor challenged Kejriwal's claim that you had given Rs 890 crore to the Northern MCD
 lekin saal bhar ke vetan kaa hisaab to 3,000 karod aata he
 Right, but is Mayor Ravindra Gupta asking all the money for the year together
 ek emsidi puure saal kaa vetan janvari main hi karmchaariyon ko de detii he
 Will the crisis of MCD end with this dues or is this crisis going to stand again
 rabindra gupta ne kaha ki dilli kii janata ko apni mahatvakanksha kii bali chadha dena scam nahin he
 She should be shunned for this new scam
 is scam main na jane kitne netaa nap jaaenge
 Hopefully Ravindra Gupta will not scam this one
 khayr meyar kii baat se laga ki ve maanate hai ki emsidi main vittiya sankat he
 He cited Article 243 that if there is a financial crisis in the municipal corporation of a state, it will be the responsibility of the state government to litigate it
 apni zimmedaari se bhaag rahe hai kejariwal
 If there is a financial crisis, then someone will also be responsible for it
 wo kejariwal hai yaa meyar rabindra gupta
 When we read article 243, it clearly states that the legislature of the state can check the accounts of the corporation
 hisaab kar sakati he
 The mayor could not tell this
 kejariwal ne kaha ki north emsidi ko vigyaapan se 17 karod aata he, jabaki 25 guna zyaada aana chahie
 Mayor of North MCD said that by showing Kejriwal, you earn 25 times money from advertising department and show us that we have no objection
 agar kejariwal ne vaaki ye vibhaag maang liya to
 i do not know whether Ravindra Gupta is really serious about this challenge or said in sentiment
 tippaniyan Mayor Ravindra Gupta said that the Delhi government says that the DDA should pay the money first
 is prakaar kii baat ek maansik rogi kar saktaa he
 The Mayor of East MCD said that the Fourth Finance Commission report should come into force soon
 dilli sarkaar ne 2 disambar ko yah report sweekaar kar lee thi or kaha tha ki report ke sujhaavon ke anuvaasar jab bhi centre ise lagu maan legaa, dilli sarkaar bhi maan legi
 In Bengaluru, Chief Minister Kejriwal made several allegations of corruption on the MCD, in response to which the Mayor said that more than half of the officers are recruited inside Delhi Municipal Corporation through Delhi Kejriwal
 aapaki sarkaar ke madhyam se
 If someone is doing corruption then we are doing it or Delhi government? Delhi government officials are committing corruption
 pehali baar pataa chalaa he ki dilli nagar nigam main bhrashtachar isliye he ki uske afasaron-karmchaariyon kii niyukti dilli sarkaar ne kii he
 i think this formula should be patented
 raajnneeti aam aadmi party bhi kar rahi he
 Kejriwal said that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections are being held after one year and his party is going to win
 ek saal pehle hi jeetne kaa elaan kar rahe hai
 If now they can give 550 crores as loan and 142 crores as stamp duty, then why not already given it
 dilli nagar nigam ke dedh lakh se zyada karmchaaree hadtaal par hai
 Due to this, work has been stopped in the government school and hospital run under the corporation
 sadakon par kooda failata ja rahaa he
 Somewhere the doctors, the cleaning staff and the administrative staff staged demonstrations at different places
 koi kisi ke ghar jaakar kooda phenk aa rahaa he to koi dilli sarkaar se yah bhi maang kar rahaa he ki dilli nagar nigam ko phir se ek kar diya jaae
 Chairman of the Joint Employees Front, Rajesh Mishra has said that the strike will go on till the three municipal corporations are united
 aath dinon se chal rahi is hadtaal ke kaaran aam logon ko takalif to ho hi rahi hogi, yah sawaal bhi mahatvapurn he ki karmchaariyon or pension par nirbhar rahane waalon ko paise nahin milenge to wo apana kharch kaise chalaayenge
 You can find out the sorrow and happiness of everyone but cannot find out who is responsible for this situation
 is bahes main shaamil logon kii bhashaa se aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki pehle raajnneetik virodh nikalataa he, baad main us virodh ko sahi tehraane vaala tathy jo unke hi hisaab se nikalataa prathit hota he
 It seems that there is a competition for deception
 donon paksh apane apane tathyon se is tarah bharamaa de rahe hai ki tathy tak pahunchnaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Till now, in the battle of Center vs Delhi, it used to be felt that Delhi has no right
 kisi anya maamle main chal rahi sunwaayee ke dauraan shahari vikaas mantralay ne apane halafname main kaha he ki teenon nigam dilli sarkaar ke tahat aate hai
 Now does this mean that Lieutenant Governor is responsible for the MCD as the chief
 lekin alji ko chunauti dene vaali dilli sarkaar ke paas yahi mauka nahin he ki wo alji se bina puche faisla le or apane adhikaar kaa istemaal kare
 The Delhi government said that the Center has the right to dissolve the corporation from the appointment of MCD commissioner
 bengalooru main mukhyamantri kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli municipal act kii dhara 486 ke tahat dilli sarkaar emsidi kii jaanch kar sakati he, lekin jab sarkaar ne acount dikhaane ko kaha to emsidi ne manaa kar diya
 Kejriwal asked why the crores of crores of rupees received from parking, hoarding and housing tax are not being accounted for
 wo paisa kahaan ja rahaa he
 His government has given 100 million more to MCD this year
 ye 100 karod rupee kahaan gaye
 His own government has recovered 300 crores in the North MCD and 76 crores in the East MCD
 ye paisa kahaan gaya
 Kejriwal said that the money had been given till 31 December, yet why the employees went on strike from 27 January
 emsidi ko 31 janvari tak 690 karod kii zarurat he jisamen se ham 550 karod kaa lone de rahe hai
 When it comes to giving money, it is said that Delhi government gives it and at the time of committing uproar, Delhi becomes a Union Territory
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki doctoron ne likhaa he ki emsidi ke aspataalon ko dilli sarkaar le le
 They do not want to live with MCD
 19 unionon ne likhaa he ki dilli nagar nigam ko bhang kar diya jaae
 Kejriwal demanded that the MCD should have a CBI probe
 iske jawaab main purvi or uttari emsidi ke meyaron ne kaha ki The CBI is ready for investigation, but along with them, the Kejriwal government, ministers and legislators should also have a CBI inquiry
 ise kehete hai bharamaane kii polytics
 Confuse it so much that it is not known what the issue was
 meyar ne kejariwal ke us daawey ko chunauti di ki aapane uttari emsidi ko 890 karod die hai
 But the salary for a year comes to Rs 3,000 crore
 sahi baat he, lekin kya meyar rabindra gupta saal bhar kaa sara paisa ek hi saath maang rahe hai
 An MCD pays full year's salary to employees only in January
 kya is bakaaye se emsidi kaa sankat ek baar main hi samaapt ho jayega yaa yah sankat phir khadaa hone vaala he
 Ravindra Gupta said that sacrificing his ambition to the people of Delhi is not a scam
 is nae scam ke liye unki daad di jaani chahie
 Do not know how many leaders will be lost in this scam
 ummid he rabindra gupta ne ye vaala scam nahin kiya hoga
 Well, it seemed to the mayor that they believe that the MCD is in financial trouble
 unhone artical 243 kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki kisi rajya ke nagar nigam main koi vittiya sankat he to use littget karne kii zimmedaari us rajya sarkaar kii hogi
 Kejriwal is running away from his responsibility
 agar vittiya sankat he to iskaa jimmedaar bhi koi hoga
 Is it Kejriwal or Mayor Ravindra Gupta
 jab hamane artical 243 padhaa to usamen ek jagah saaf-saaf likhaa he ki rajya kii vidhayika nigam ke khaaton kii jaanch kar sakati he
 Can calculate
 ye baat shaayad meyar nahin bataa sake
 Kejriwal said that the North MCD receives 17 crore from advertisements, while 25 times more should come
 north emsidi ke meyar ne kaha ki kejariwal ji vigyaapan vibhaag se 25 guna paisa aap kamakar dikhaa dijie hamen koi aapatti nahin he
 If Kejriwal really asked for this department
 mujhe nahin pataa ki rabindra gupta is chanauti ko lekar vaaki gambhir hai yaa bhavukta main kah gaye
 The comments meyar rabindra gupta ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar kahati he ki pehle didie uskaa paisa de
 This type of thing can be done by a mental patient
 east emsidi ke meyar ne kaha ki chauthe vitt ayog kii report jaldi lagu ho
 The Delhi government accepted the report on December 2 and said that whenever the Center considers it applicable to the suggestions of the report, the Delhi government will accept it
 bengalooru main mukhyamantri kejariwal ne emsidi par bhrashtachar ke kai aarope lagaae, jiske jawaab main meyar ne kaha ki aadhe se zyaada adhikari dilli ke madhyam se dilli nagar nigam ke andar recruit kiye jate hai kejariwal sahab
 Through your government
 agar koi bhrashtachar kar rahaa he to wo ham kar rahe hai yaa dilli sarkaar? dilli sarkaar ke adhikari kar rahe hai bhrashtachar
 It is revealed for the first time that corruption in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi is because the Delhi government has appointed its officers and employees
 mere khyaal se is formula kaa patent kara lenaa chahie
 Aam Aadmi Party is also doing politics
 kejariwal ne kaha ki ek saal baad dilli nagar nigam ke chunaav ho rahe hai or unki party jeetne vaali he
 Announcing to win a year ago
 agar abhi wo 550 karod karj ke taur par or 142 karod stamp duty ke taur par de sakate hai to pehle hi kyon nahin de diya

 piem narendra modi ne 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main aitihaasik jeet hasil kii thi, tab vaishvik netaaon main sabase pehle benjamin netanyahu ne hi unhen badhai di thi
 At the same time, a banner between the general elections in Israel also became very viral
 binar main pradhanmantri narendra modi or unke samakaksh benjamin netanyahu saath dikh rahe the
 a picture of this banner was posted by Israeli journalist Amichai Stein

 Let us know the big things related to the Israeli elections, in the election held on April 9, Netanyahu's Likud party captured 36 out of 120 seats
 jo gantz kii blue and white party se ek adhik thi
 Netanyahu got the mandate to form the government, but the coalition government did not last long and Parliament was dissolved in May
 17 sitambar ko hone vaala chunaav partiyon ko sarkaar banane kaa doosraa mauka degaa
 According to an Israeli political analyst, this time too nothing is going to change
 mana ja rahaa he ki nattejey april main hue chunaav kii tarah hi honge
 Israeli local media conducted 2 poll surveys last week
 iske mutabik, likud party ko 32 seat mil rahi hai jo blue or white se sirf ek zyada he
 In Israel, no single party has ever succeeded in forming a single government
 aise main yahaan par gathbandhan kii sarkaar bananaa aam baat he
 The president of Israel is usually invited by the leader of the party with the most seats to form the new government
 agar netaa 61 siten hasil karne ke liye zyada se zyada partiyon ko ekasaath laane main asafal rahata he to aise main raashtrapati kisi or mauka dete hai
 Because of this, the leader of the party who won the election is not necessarily the same Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri banane ke liye netanyahu ko dakshinpanthi guton ke samarthan kii zarurat he, jisase vah 61 siton ke saath sarkaar banane main safal rahen
 At the same time, Gantz will need the support of the center-left blocks and the Arab Joint List to get a majority
 lekin israeli media ke haal ke pole ke mutabik netanyahu ko 56 siten milane kaa anumaan he, jabaki gantj kii party ko 55 siten mil sakati hai
 According to analysts, neither Netanyahu nor Gantz will succeed in forming a coalition government

 Analysts say the issue is very controversial
 vishleshkon ke mutabik haalanki isroyal ko philistiniyon ke saath sthaayee shanti banane kaa avasar mila
 This issue was conveyed lightly in political parties and their campaign message
 netanyahu kaa bhavishyajulai maah main benjamin netanyahu sabase lambey samay tak isroyal ke pradhanmantri pad par rahane vaale netaa bane
 He defeated the founder of the country, David ben-gurion
 is baar kaa chunaav netanyahu ke liye bhi sabase ahm he

 Godhra has been the biggest center of the Gujarat riots

 However, the first two elections after independence were also held in the name of Panchmahal seat

 jabaki lojpa ke muslim ummidavaar kaleem abdul latif ko 23 hajaar vot mili or bhartiya maanav seva dal ke pratyaashee mukhtaar mansuri ko 10 hajaar vot mili
 Election analysts considered the better performance of these two candidates as the reason for Vaghela's defeat

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Children below 18 years will not be able to participate in the human pyramids built in Dahi Handi festival this year in Maharashtra
 dahi handi kii oonchai bhi 20 feet se zyaada nahin hogi
 In this program to be held on the occasion of Janmashtami, the Supreme Court has ordered continuation of the order of Bombay High Court which came in 2014
 2014 main bombai hai court ne dahi handi ke dauraan hone vaali durghatnaon par sangyaan lete hue isamen 18 saal se kam ke bacchon kii bhagidaari par roak laga di thi
 The High Court also ordered the height of the human pyramid to be built on Dahi Handi not to exceed 20 feet
 isi aadesh ko is baar bhi supreme court ne jari rakhane ko kaha he
 In 2014 itself, the Supreme Court had given an interim stay on the order of the High Court, hearing the petition of the organizers of Dahi Handi
 lekin ab supreme court ne kaha he ki filhal hai court kaa vahi aadesh lagu rahegaa
 The Supreme Court has said that this issue will be heard in detail in the month of October
 iske saath hi ye saafe ho gaya he ki aayojakon ko 2014 main mili raahat ab barkaraar nahin he
 They have to follow the order of the High Court
 haalanki, supreme court ne hai court ke us aadesh par philhal roak laga di he jisamen aayojakon se police thane main jaakar bacchon kii umr kii pushti karaane ko kaha gaya tha
 During the hearing, the counsel for the Government of Maharashtra said that Lord Krishna used to remove butter pot in his childhood
 isliye 12 saal se zyaada ke bacchon ko dahi handi main hissaa lene diya jaataa he
 Justice Anil Dave, presiding over the two-judge bench, said, “lord Krishna did not show such feat
 bacchon kii jaan khatre main nahin daali ja sakati
 'it has been argued by the Government of Maharashtra that there is an emotional connection with the Dahi Handi festival and since Krishna used to steal yogurt from a pot in childhood, it is a practice to allow small children to participate in the human pyramid
 lekin supreme court ne is aayojanon main hone vaali durghatnaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ijazat nahin di
 In fact, the Maharashtra government had filed this petition in the Supreme Court for clarification on the decision of Bombay High Court, on which the Supreme Court has now given this interim decision while hearing
 sunwaayee ke dauraan bombai hai court main yachika daalane vaali swati sayaji patil or hai court legal aid ke vakil nitesh es nevshe kaa bhi paksh supreme court ne liya
 On both sides, it was said that the Dahi Handi organizers are violating the Bombay High Court and Supreme Court decisions of 2014
 isi liye swati ne bombai hai court main court ke aadesh kii avamanana kii yachika bhi daali he
 On behalf of both of them, it was said in the Supreme Court that every year hundreds of people are injured in the organizing of Dahi Handi and some even die, so the order of the High Court should be followed completely
 ab supreme court oktober main is maamle par vistaar se sunwaayee karegaa

 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha

 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken

 com / aegtybiocb — Piyush Goyal (@piyushgoyal) February 28, 2017 Goyal alleged that the BSP and SP governments have failed to provide electricity and reach villages
 basapa ne baad ke apane teen varsh ke kaarykaal main maatr 79 nae gaanvon tak bijli pahunchaai thi
 When the SP government came, it slept for the first two years
 baad ke varshon main maatr 62 nae gaanvon tak bijli pahunchaai
 If the BJP formed a government at the Center, then rural electrification was focused on the Centre's suggestion
 varsh 2015-16 main hamane 1305 nae gaanvon tak bijli pahunchaai
 After the formation of our government, we sent officials from the center and through this system and department, reached power to 21404 hamlets
 goyal ne chunaav purv va baad ke bijli aapurti sambandhi ek sanstha ke aankade bhi pesh karte hue kaha ki yahi hakeekat he

 In a reply, he said that after conducting a probe in eight villages of Moradabad MP Sarvesh Kumar, it has been confirmed that the Akhilesh Yadav government has distributed electricity connections in the name of caste and religion
 goyal ne kaha ki kai saansadon kii ore se shikaayatein ai hai
 Rupees have also been taken in the name of connection to the poor
 piyush goyal ne kaha ki centre main bijepi kii sarkaar na ai hoti to uttar pradesh ke vidyutikaran main teji na dikhaai detii

 The BSP had provided electricity to only 79 new villages in its later three-year tenure
 sapa kii sarkaar ai to pehle do saal tak soi rahi
 In later years, electricity was provided to only 62 new villages
 centre main bijepi kii sarkaar bani to gramin vidyutikaran par centre ke kehane par dhyaan diya gaya
 In the year 2015-16, we brought electricity to 1305 new villages
 hamaari sarkaar banane ke baad hamane centre se adhikariyon ko bhejkar yaheen ke system or vibhaag ke jariye 21404 tole-majaron tak bijli pahunchaai
 Goyal also presented the data of an organization related to electricity supply before and after the election, and said that this is the reality
 piyush goyal ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kii yojana he ki 15 agast 2022 tak sabhi ko choubees ghante saaton din nirbaadh bijli mili
 The draft related to this was signed by all the states
 sirf uttar pradesh sarkaar ne ab tak hastakshar nahin kiye
 Akhilesh Yadav government does not want to give benefit of electricity to the people and farmers
 uttar pradesh main nirbaadh bijli sirf saifai ko milti he
 For the first time after the BJP government came to power at the Center, there is electricity and coal surplus in the country
 baavjood iske uttar pradesh sarkaar neshnal grid se bijli nahin kharidti

 shunya se chah degree kam taapmaana or sard hawaaon ke chalate bheetar tak galaa dene vaali bhayankar thand ke bich lagaataar kai ghante shooting karne ke baad bollywood abhinetri greysi singh, abhinayta ranvir shouri, raajapaal yadav or nirdeshak suman ganguli waapas mumbai pahunch chuke hai, lekin sardi ko yaad kar abhi bhi unke rongte khadey ho rahe hai
 The shooting of the film Blue Mountain was completed in Shimla and Kufri recently
 is dauraan yahaan kai maukon par shunya se chah degree kam taapmaana rahaa
 Director Suman Ganguly has also claimed to have left behind Switzerland by capturing beautiful views of the snowy litigants
 blue mountain ke nirdeshak suman ganguli ne kaha, 'bollywood ke kai nirmaataa-nirdeshak barf ke mausam main shimla, kufri, narkanda jaise ilaakon main shooting se ghabaraate hai kyonki mausam kaa kuch pataa nahin hota or bollywood ke kalakaaron ke nakhre sahanaa bhi aasaan nahin hai
 But, i had a wonderful experience
 mausam ne bhale puri tarah saath nahin diya, lekin kalakaaron or unit ke sadasyon ke saath kii vajah se maine un nazaaron ko camere main kaid kiya he, jise dekhakar switsraland or shimla ke bich kaa fark karnaa naammumkin hoga
 After this thrilling experience, Ranveer Shorey is also experiencing a cold in Mumbai
 vah kehete hai, 'yun to maine lakshya ke dauraan ladakh main bhi shooting kii he, jahaan kahin kam taapmaana tha lekin barfili hawaaon ne shimla or kufri ke mausam ko jabardast tareeke se khatarnaak bana diya tha
 Even now, i start to fidget when i remember that cold
 'is maukey par abhinetri greysi singh ne kaha, 'isamen koi shaq nahin ki is mausam main shooting kii sochna bhi himmat kaa kaam he
 Suddenly snow starts falling and cold winds shake within
 to duusare hi pal mausam saaf lagane lagata
 The center of the film's story is Shimla
 nirdeshak ko abhi film kaa doosraa hissaa filmana tha, jisamen barfili vaadiyaan dikhaayi jaani he
 This is the need of the film's story
 isliye mausam se ghabaraane kaa koi sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 Yes, the spirit that the director and technicians have introduced, is a compliment
 gauratlab he ki bhayankar thand ke chalate kai nirmaataa-nirdeshkon ne shimla or aasapaas ke ilaakon main shooting kaa apana iraadaa badal diya
 However, Suman Ganguly stayed with his entire unit
 unhone barfili vaadiyon main shooting kar dikhaayi
 Meanwhile, in Kufri, the actors were also trapped amidst the snow, which were evacuated
 lekin, film ke liye jis tarah ke shot liye gaye hai, usase sabhi kalakaar kaaphi khush hai
 The second phase of shooting of the film Blue Mountain will begin in Mumbai this month

 com / 85c15pdif4 Baba Ramdev, without naming, targeted Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh and said that he should stop accusing me from behind and answer questions directly in front of the media
 ’congress mahasachiv digvijay singh dwaara lagaaye gayi kuch aaropon kaa zikr karte hue ramdev ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘congress ke in mahasachiv ne sari maryaadaaon kaa ulanghan kar hamaare khilaaf ghinaune shadyantr rache or mere guru ko laapata karaane kaa aarope tak mujh par lagaaya
 Ramdev did not name the Congress General Secretary even after repeated questioning by reporters, but all the references he gave were clearly pointing towards Digvijay Singh
 ramdev ne kaha ki yah vahi mahasachiv hai, jinke kehane par madhya pradesh main meri gaadi par pathar phenke gayi or jo akasar unhen aaropon main gherte hai
 Yogguru said that he was accused of missing his mentor, while in 2007 Uttarakhand Police's final report on the disappearance of his mentor said that this case is long overdue and it also has some future investigation
 Does not seem likely
 gauratlab he ki gat varsh ramlila maidan main aadhi raat ke samay ramdev ke samarthakon par hui police karrwai ke baad digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya tha ki ramdev kaa haath apane guru kii gumshudagi main he
 Ramdev said on Sunday that when i came to know about the disappearance of my guru in 2007, i was in London and i spoke to the then Chief Minister of Uttarakhand BC Khanduri
 unhone kaha, ‘is tarah kaa gaiyr jimmedaarana aarope ek do baar nahin hajaar baar lagaaya gaya he
 Ramdev went on a scathing attack on the Congress General Secretary, saying, "how can i think of my Guru like this?" lagata he unki soch kharaab he
 They must have done so with their elders
 ’yogaguru ne aarope lagaaya ki unke khilaaf sajeesh ke liye aapraadhik pravriti ke ek shaks ko aage kiya gaya ‘jiskaa naam pushparaj sharma urf pushp shukla’ he
 According to Ramdev, a case of blackmailing is registered against this person in the Parliament Street police station
 ramdev ne kaha ki unhone internet ke madhyam se is shaks ke bare main jaankaree ikatthi kii
 Baba said, "the nominees will register an FIR against Pushparaj of criminal tendency and demand action
 ’ unhone aarope lagaaya ki is shaks ne logon ko pralobhan dekar mere khilaaf galat bayaan ricard karaaye
 Ramdev also referred to the incident in 2010 of an activist of his organization, Rajiv Dixit, who died in Chhattisgarh, saying that he was also held responsible for Rajiv's death even though the records present indicate that he died of illness
 ramdev ne daawa kiya ki rajeev kaa ilaaj jin aspataalon main hua unamem or upachaar karne vaale sabhi doctoron ke paas filein maujuud hai
 He also has records which suggest that Rajiv died of heart disease
 yogaguru ne kaha, ‘hamane apane saarvajanik or nijee jivan main kabhi dohare maapdand nahin apanaaye
 Ended the existence of private life
 lekin hamaare upar aise aarope lagaaye gayi hai jinke bare main ham soch bhi nahin sakate
 What selfishness can we have in the death of late Rajiv Bhai
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ham media ke madhyam se aarope lagane waalon ko chunauti dete hai ki kaayron kii tarah agenciyon kaa durupyog karte hue peeche se ghinaune or ghatiya aarope lagaana choden or saamne aakar baat karen
 'ramdev also said,' i will request the Congress President (sonia Gandhi) that when her party is engulfed in such calamities and scandals, either think again about keeping such people together or the Congress Party is responsible for their statements

 ' Amid mounting debt burden like a mountain, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has given her administration the mantra to spend public money by handling it
 mamata ne iske liye ection plan taiyaar kiya he
 In a high-level meeting with ministers and bureaucrats at the Secretariat on Thursday, Mamta stressed on the utilization of government funds
 mamata ne phijulkharchi rokane ke liye mitvyayita sambandhi kai upayon kaa elaan kiya
 Mamta said, 'our government is working towards repaying the debt during its tenure itself
 isi saal ham 46,000 karod rupye kaa punarbhugtan karenge
 We need Rs 5,000 crore to give additional dearness allowance to our employees
 saath hi kanyashri, sabuj saathi aadi jaisi mukhya yojanaon ke liye bhi paise kii aavashyaktaa he
 To save money, Mamta Banerjee has also suggested a 7-point recipe
 1
 "we have to stop wasted expenses by insisting on innovative methods and efficiency," said Mamta, who has stopped misusing and wasting public money
 hamen durupyog ko rokna hoga
 We are not compromising on public services but we need money to run them
 2
 Departments to be added to reduce bureaucracy Mamta announced the administrative reforms, saying, we have reduced the number of ministries from 63 to 51
 12 vibhaagon ko duusare vibhaagon ke saath mila diya gaya he
 3
 sansadhano ke prabhavi upyog par focusamamata banerjee ne kaha, hamen projecton ko samaybaddh dhang se amal main laane ke liye samaysima kaa paalan karnaa hoga
 Human resources should be re-adjusted after proper training and counseling
 4
 Erroneous tenders should be monitored
 mamata banerjee ke mutabik paise kii barbaadi rokane ke liye tenderon ko bairiphai kiya jaae
 Mamta said, many times, flawed tenders cause huge financial loss to the government
 hamen is par puraa dhyaan dena hoga
 5
 baithkon ke liye shahar se baahar kii yatraaon se bachaa jaemmata banerjee ne elaan kiya ki rajya sarkaar kii ab sabhi ahm baithken video conference ke jariye kii jaaengi
 6
 "ek vyakti – ek vaahan"mukhyamantri ne is baat par aprasannataa jaahir kii ki aise mantri jinke paas kai vibhaag hai, ve kai vaahanon ko apane saath rakhte hai
 Mamta Banerjee said that such a trend should be stopped and a minister should be allotted only one vehicle
 7
 According to sources, Mamata Banerjee has issued instructions for austerity menus for various government meetings, according to sources, no longer a provision for expensive food for bureaucrats
 ab mukhyamantri kii ore se bulaai jane vaali baithkon main naukarshahon ke liye chaay or alpaahar kii hi vyavastha kii jaaegi

 After passing from the Lok Sabha, the triple talaq bill will be presented in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne ise lekar apane saansadon ko vip jari kiya he
 The Modi government will depend on non-nda, non-upa parties to pass the triple talaq bill in the Rajya Sabha

 chhattisgarh main vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa pehla daawa hi khokhla sabit hota najar aa rahaa he
 Two months ago, Rahul Gandhi announced at the activist conference held in Durg that before August 15, the party would announce its candidates for more than half of the assembly seats
 yahi nahin congress adhyaksh banane ke baad pehali baar durg main congressi kaaryakartaaon se rubaru hote hue pratyaashee chayan kii prakriya par bhi rahul gandhi ne apni manshaa jaahir kii thi
 Rahul Gandhi had also told how now suitable candidates will be selected in the party and he will be replaced by the cadre and the cadre-based workers in place of Hawa Hawaii leaders before August 15
 lekin kisi bhi surat main nahin lagata ki rahul gandhi kaa ye daawa sach sabit hoga
 There is still a week left for August 15, in such a situation that there is a lot of buzz among the Congress leaders about this promise of Rahul Gandhi
 puri prakriya main lag saktaa he maheene bhar kaa samaydusri ore congress ke bheetar pratyaashee chayan kii praarambhik prakriya ab jaakar shuru hui he, block congress cametiyaan in dinon ummidavaaron ke aavedan jamaa kar rahi hai
 After collecting these applications, first the names of the candidates from the District Congress Committee, then the State Congress Committee and then from the Election Steering Committee to the AICC will be considered and a final seal will be given
 iske baad hi party apane ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa karegi
 Obviously this whole process may take a month

 As part of its old strategy, the Congress used to field its candidates only after announcing the candidates of the main opposition parties, but now the party has changed its strategy

 In such a situation, the Congress high command had planned to announce the names of the candidates a few months before the election, changing their strategy, but this plan is seen to be kept clear
 party sutron ke mutabik jald hi pratyaashee chayan nahin hua to pehle kii tarah hi halaat banenge
 The authorized candidates will not get enough time for campaigning and they will fall prey to strategic lapses
 philhal raipur main rahul gandhi kaa besabri se intjaar ho rahaa he
 On 10 August, he will inaugurate the new party headquarters of the Congress
 party apane isi nae bhawan se vidhansabha chunaav kaa aagaaj karegi
 Therefore, a group of Congress leaders will meet Rahul Gandhi and consider announcing the names of at least some key contenders before August 15

 Eminent lawyer and Additional Solicitor General Indira Jaisingh strongly objected to the use of the word 'concubine' in the Supreme Court judgment regarding the right to live for women living in live-in relationships
 ucchtam nyaayalay main gusse main najar aa raheen jaisingh ne nyaayamurti markendeya katju or ties thakur kii sadsyta vaali peeth se kaha ki faisle main istemaal kiya gaya shabd behad aapattijanak he or ise hataae jane kii jarurat he
 Jaisingh said that how can the Supreme Court of India use the word 'concubine' for a woman in the 21st century? Can a woman say that she has hired a man? She told the court that i would like to file an application to remove this comment
 main is adaalat ke saamne pesh nahin hona chaahati hoon, main khud ko isse alag rakhana chaahuungi
 Jaisingh expressed great surprise at how the country's highest court could make such remarks against a woman
 eesg kaa rukh dekhakar peeth kii adhyakshata kar rahe nyaayamurti katju ne unase kaha ki vah nyaayalay ke saamne khud ko mukademe tak hi simit rakhen
 However, Justice Thakur intervened and asked Jaisingh whether it would be more appropriate to use the word 'cockbine' instead of 'funnel'? To this, the ASG stated that their objection was mainly on the use of the word 'keep' ie 'concubine' in the judgment delivered by the bench
 gauratlab he ki indira jaisingh gharelu hinsa se mahila kaa sangrakshan kanoon kaa masauda taiyaar karne main bhi shaamil rahi hai
 In an important judgment, the Supreme Court on Thursday said that a woman living in a live-in relationship is not entitled to alimony unless she meets certain criteria
 nyaayalay ne yah bhi kaha tha ki mahaj kuch saptahanth saath guzaar lene yaa ek raat guzaar lene se yah ek gharelu rishta nahin ho jaataa

 Professor Swamy told Live Science, 'at first we found that men think that thin women are attractive but now it has also come to light that such men want to look beautiful in the eyes of women and themselves more on their bodybuilding Pay attention
 ’unhone kaha, ‘iske alaava jo samaaj pitru sattatmak hai vahaan bhi purush sharir saushthav ke jariye apana prabhutv darshana chaahate hai

 sahasrabuddhe 2016-17 kaa academik satr shuru hone ke pehle se hi desh ke ejineering collejon ko chetavanee de rahe hai
 "of the nearly 17 lakh engineering seats, at least 100,000 seats will be eliminated," he warns
 deshbhar main kareeb 100 college band ho jaaenge jabaki 2015-16 main 200 nae college khule hai
 The "drop out" rate is expected to increase as many colleges are already headed for closure
 daakhile band karke maujuuda batch ke paas hone kaa intjaar he
 Early trends are also warning of a substantial decline in engineering studies in 2016-17
 khaskar un rajyon main daakhila hasil karne vaale thode hi hai, jahaan pichley do dashakon main kai college ug aae hai
 In Telangana, 83 engineering colleges were refused accreditation, another 35 colleges were given notice to expand the laboratory and other facilities to conform to the standards and 58 other colleges were issued Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (hyderabad) for 2016-17

 " ve bataate hai ki doshi collejon ne na bandi kii ijaajat lene ke liye aavedan kiya, na pehle ke varshon main daakhila le chuke chaatro ke liye sambhddhata hasil karne kii phikr kii
 Meanwhile, only 63,777 students applied for the reduced 79,705 seats available in the state this year, as more and more students are of the opinion that job prospects have decreased and more attractive opportunities are available from studying in other subjects

 For the first time in Maharashtra, a record number of 1,41,000 students appeared for the Medical Common Entrance Test (CET) while the number of those appearing for the Engineering CET examination was only 1,26,000
 gauratlab he ki 2015-16 ke academik satr main rajya main ejineering kii 1,60,000 siton main se kareeb 64,000 siten nahin bhar pain
 This is also the situation in West Bengal, where two out of every five seats remain vacant
 jab yah dekha gaya ki siten khaali rah rahi hai or saajha pravesh pariksha (jipsi) se aae 88,000 chaatro main se sirf 15,000 ne hi counselling ke jariye daakhila liya to rajya ke adhikariyon ne daakhile ke niyam is had tak naram kar die ki paatrata pariksha main 40 fisadi ank or jeii main rank hasil karne vaala daakhila le saktaa he
 Despite this, only 26,000 of the 40,000 seats were filled
 yadavapur uniwarsity, bengal ejineering college or science uniwarsity jaise pratishthit sansthaanon ko bhi siten khaali chhodmai padin, kyonki khanan or metllergy jaise behad maang vaale vishyon main daakhila lene vaala koi nahin tha

 "the second reason for the vacancy of seats in more and more colleges in 2016-17 is the ongoing hype about the National eligibility-cum-entrance Examination (NEET)
 isse zyada ejineering kii siten khaali rahane kaa andeshaa he
 Sahasrabuddhe also states that a large number of private universities, deemed universities, iits and NIT institutes are opening up more for engineering education courses
 isse bhi eysitii se manyata praapt collejon main daakhile prabhavit ho rahe hai
 In Sahasrabuddhe's opinion, the current trend of closure of engineering colleges is not a concern
 ve kehete hai, ''kharaab pradarshan vaale collejon ko to band hona hi chahie
 Higher quality institutions should help improve the quality of middle-class institutions

 Many better engineering colleges have significantly higher fees
 prashasnic gadabadjhaale, khastahal infrastracchar, nazaij fees or shikshakon kii kami ne bhi ejineering shiksha ke str ko giraaya he
 Maharashtra ranks second behind Tamil Nadu in terms of most engineering colleges with 365 colleges

 The rules of AICTE are clear in every respect like classroom, workshop, laboratory, library, drawing hall, land size and student-teacher ratio

 An engineering college cannot enroll students before attaining EOA
 lekin aksar padtaal main paaya jaataa he ki eysitii se ioe hasil karne ke liye di gai soochna jamini hakeekat se mail nahin khaati

 At the moment, there is a shortage of about 35 percent of qualified, experienced teachers
 sahasrabuddhe bataate hai, ''shikshakon kii kami kii bharpai ke liye udyog se sahyogi faikalti bhi bulaai jaaegi
 "in 2016-17, they are going to start a project themselves, which will provide offline or online courses for students from remote colleges
 isse shikshakon or chaatro, donon ko laabh hoga
 Hope is probably tied to that as they will be able to force colleges to follow the guidelines of AICTE
 (—saath main kiran taare or romita datta) We do not consider junk as a thing of two cents and we stop thinking about it
 lekin pashchimi rajasthan main jodhpur shahar ke kuch aise yuva vyavsaayee hai jo raat-din kabad ke bare main hi sochate rahete hai
 Three years ago, who had no respect in the city, the same junk has become the basic mantra of becoming a millionaire today
 yakeen na ho to jodhpur ke priti international ke maalik ritesh lohia (39) or sahakarmi patni priti (37) se puuchhie
 The Lohia couple got so much junk that now they are not even paying attention to their original business of export, furniture handicrafts
 ve har vakt kabad ke jugad main lage rahete hai
 There is a solid reason for this
 unki form kaa vyavsaay jo 2009 se pehle 16 karod ru
 The annual was now 35 crores due to junk
 tak pahunch gaya he
 What is this junk of junk? It actually starts in 2009
 us daur kii vyavsaayik mandi kii maar sabhi chote-bade vyavsaayiyon par padi
 Preity International, which exports furniture handicrafts, was not untouched by it
 unheen bure dinon main lohia dampati ke paas ek din denmark se unka ek graahak aayaa
 He was looking at the furniture in the warehouse that he noticed a tin on which a laborer accidentally put a cloth pad made of cloth and he started seeing the antique chair
 graahak ko vah idia itnaa bhaayaa ki usne lohia ko bekaar chizon se aise hi utpaada banane kii raay de daali
 Lohia couple sitting silent in the recession also started running their mind
 tin kaa kabad batora gaya or hajaaron kii sankhya main jugad se bane stool videsh bheje jane lage
 The demand of America and Australia is also not being met
 ghi yaa tel ke dibbon par na koi paint, na rangarogan
 Made a cloth pad and affixed on it
 aisi antic gaddiyaan baniin ki unki supplai kar paanaa mushkil ho gaya
 Listen to Ritesh, "this item is running so much that the tin box wastes 30
" main bhi nahin kharid rahe the, aaj 100 ru
 i am not even giving it to us
 '' yani kabadi bhi maalamaal ho rahe hai
 Apart from stools, Lohia is now sending all domestic products such as sofas, chairs, bar chairs / tables, cupboards, carpets, carpets, bedsheets, pillows abroad
 lohe, lakdi or jute se bani ye chijen ritesh apni boranada sthit unit main taiyaar karte hai
 He has set up another unit at Basni near Jodhpur, where textile related products are manufactured
 inaki dizin priti taiyaar karti hai
 The firm has recently received orders for 2,000 hoses from Korea
 kabad ke in sajile utpaadon ne jodhpur ke handicrafts niryaatkon ke dhandhe main jaan phoonk di he
 According to Siddharth Mehta (35) of Fortune Export, who landed in this business two years ago, due to the choice of foreigners, new products are also being sold and old
 unke godaam main taiyaar ho rahi ek nai rack par majdoor scrtch karte dikhe
 Mehta clarifies, "never get junk items, then new items have to be made like junk because they are sold as soon as they are ready
 '' dhimi shuruyaat ke baad ab chaa jane kii taiyaari main lage mehta puraani chizon se bane utpaadon ke yahi koi 20 container har maheene america, europe or austelia bhejte hai
 Mehta's business after jugaad from junk was Rs 16 to 20 crores
 salanaa pahunch gaya he
 Now look at the math of profits
 ritesh ko dariyon ke order ko puraa karne ke liye sena ke tent or duusare kapade nilaamee ke dauraan kharidne pade
 Clippings of those clothes were made by the workers
 maal or mazdooree ke baad ek dari par kharch aayaa 500 ru
 , Which in Korea cost Rs 2,000
 main bikegi
 Ritesh's firm ships 35 container products of such goods every month to several countries like USA, Europe, Singapore, Korea, Germany
 aise har utpaada par ek tag laga hota he, jis par utpaada ke nirmaan kii paddati kii puri jaankaree hoti he
 Goods of scrap and honesty are also fulfilled
 jodhpur ke ek darjan yuva vyavsaayee jab ek hi dhandhe main koode hon to pratispardhaa to hogi hi
 In such a situation, everyone has to make their product something special in some way
 mehta kaa daawa he ki ''antarrashtriya maanakon vaala or iko friendli hona mere saamaan kii khaasiyat he
 '' There are couches made of various types of clothes here
 antic dikhne vaale in sofon kii khaasi maang he
 Mehta buys fabric junk from Gujarat and iron from across the state
 is vyavsaay kaa ek pahalu yah bhi he ki isamen sara kaam mashin kii bajaae haath se hi hota he
 Because of this the cost may be slightly higher, but the avenues of employment are also open
 kabad se umdaa utpaada banane vaali ek or form da home ke manish bansal (35) kehete hai, ''mashiinon kaa isamen dur-dur tak koi kaam nahin
 "bansal also jumped into this business in 2009 and these products cost his business 2 crore
 salanaa se badhaakar 4 karod ru
 Delivered to bansal kapade main packwork kaa khaas tarah kaa item taiyaar kar rahe hai
 He bought old clothes from the junkies of Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat
 kapade kaa kaam laayak hissaa nikaalkar baaki tukdon ko jod us bade kapade par mazdooron se imbridari or jari kaa kaam karavaaya
 Products like bedsheets, pillows, photographs and canvas were made from this fine-grained fabric
 gauratlab he ki barmer kaa chauhaton gaanv puri tarah se packwork ke kaam se judaa he
 Here every household has one, two or more families doing patchwork
 akele packwork se 500-700 logon ko kaam mil rahaa he
 Ajay Sharma of another firm, The Home Designer Accessories, brought out products made of old jeans clothes, they are not able to meet them
 bilkul nayaa idia tha yah
 Sharma's business is Rs 30 lakh
 se badhkar 3 karod ru
 Arrived annually
 ve bhi 2009 main mandi main hi is dhandhe main utre the
 His theory was: make anything but it should look different
 bas isi se sharma maalamaal ho gaye
 Each month they ship about 10 containers of goods to the US and Europe
 sharma kii form ke manager em
 Listen to Usmani: "we keep running our mind to create new items
 ''istemaal ho chuki chizon se bane saamaan ke bhavishya ko ujdgaval bataate hue priti bhi nai soch ke pahalu ko hi rekhaankit karti hai
 In his words, "we have to create creative, new and different items
" '' aisa saamaan jo sajaavati kam or gharelu upyog ke liye zyada ho
 Mehta also supports the Lohia couple's point of view, " There is more demand for home-use products
" '' forchyun export aalmaari, teble, kursi, sopha, karpet jaise kai utpaada nae tareeke se ijad kar rahaa he
 'west (idle) is the best', this is the mantra of these young businessmen of Jodhpur
 inhone mandi ke daur main kuch nayaa kiya or itane safal hue ki unhone apane mul vyavsaay ko alag chhod diya
 His move was right in the direction of global warming, it also created new opportunities for workers and artisans
 aaj 2,000 majdoor isse guzaara kar rahe hai
 The businessmen of Jodhpur, who became millionaires from the things of junk, have not only raided in Rajasthan but also in the international market of the country
 baat to nai soch kii he

 As a result, the central government became active for payment of dues to farmers and on June 6, Rs 7,000 crore
 ke package kaa elaan kiya gaya
 But a permanent solution to the problem is still not revealed
 samasya kya haidrasal, desh main chini udyog susti ke shikanje main he
 Till May 15, farmers at sugar mills in the country have Rs 23,000 crore
 bakaayaa the
 And it kept increasing because of the interest charged because under the Sugar Control Act, the mills have to pay interest if they do not pay in due time

 chini udyog ke sheersh sanghathan indian sugar mills association (isma) kaa kahana he ki chini kii khapat jas kii tas he par ganne kii upaj zyada ho rahi he
 Last year, the country consumed 246 lakh tonnes of sugar
 is saal 250 lakh ton khapat kii ummid he
 Sugar mills say that sugarcane has grown by one and a half times this year, so sugar production is also high
 chini milon ke paas ganna kisaanon ke bhugtan ke liye rakam nahin he
 Sugar production is not only responsible for the poor condition of sugar mills and farmers, but also imports
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik, 2017-18 main pakistan se 13,110 metric ton chini mangvayi gai
 The government argues that a small amount of sugar was imported from Pakistan
 iske mukaable niryaat kahin zyada he
 The resentment of the farmers increased, but the government got a real shock when the by-elections were held in Kairana and Nurpur in western UP, in the area of sugarcane belt, and the BJP lost a lot
 iske baad sarkaar ne ganna kisaanon kii sud lee or raahat kaa elaan kiya
 Indian Farmers Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait also agrees that the government has taken this step due to the farmers' displeasure
 tikait kehete hai, ''sha kii janata naaraaz he
 Procurement of commercial use of sugar should be made at a different rate

 The government should make such an arrangement through which the payment of crop to the farmer is immediate

 "tikait also said that he is going to make a big movement soon on the issue of farmers
" kairana ke kisaan yogendra kaa kahana he ki jo bhi package he, usase kisaanon ke bakaae kaa bhugtan sidhe kiya jaae, na ki chini milon ke jariye
 For the first time in the package given by the Government for the relief package and Chintakkaya payment of mills, it has been provided that the mills will pay Rs
 29
 prati kilo se kam keemat par chini nahin bech sakengi
 There are three components in the package: one, 5 for payment of cane dues
 5 rupye quintal kii dar se kareeb 1,500 karod ru
 ; Secondly, subsidy to mills for buffer stock and third, subsidy to mills on loan from bank
 29 ru
 The price has been calculated according to the fair and remunerative price (FRP) of sugarcane
 isma ke mahanideshak abinaash verma 29 ru
 Kg questions the lowest price
 verma kaa kahana he, 'sarkaar ne yah daam isliye tay kiya taaki ham ganne kaa daam de saken
 The FRP pays the mill owner to the farmer at Rs 290 per quintal
 is mulya ko aadhaar banaaya jaae to chini kaa daam kam se kam 35
 80 Rs
 prati kilo baithta he
 Applying the formula of the Rangarajan Committee also costs the same
 29 rupye kaa daam maujuuda halaat ke lihaaj se thik he lekin paryaapt nahin he
 It is not enough to pay the farmers in full
 70 lakh ton sarplus chini he, agle saal sarplus or badaae ke asaar hai isliye mil maalik 29 rupye ke rate par chini bechney ko baadhya honge
 "the mill owners believe that this will improve the condition but the mills will not be able to recover
" ve daleel dete hai ki jab uttar pradesh ne centre sarkaar ko chitthee likhakar nunatam daam 34 ru
 Had demanded to keep 29 rupees
 kaa rate tay karne kii bahut tuk nahin banati
 The mill owners raise the question whether the loan should come in the package as they get the loan on their status
 saath hi bafer stock abhi jiro tha is par sarkaar sabsidi degi
 Its conditions are also complicated

 saxena kehete hai, ''upi main chini kii utpaadan laagat bad rahi he
 The price that the government fixes for sugarcane is not suitable for the cost of production of sugar mills
 pani, urvarak samet sabhi chizon ke daam bade hai isliye kisaanon kii bhi laagat bad rahi he
 The problem has become worse due to lower sugar prices
 '' saxena kehete hai ki chini ke daam badaye jate hai to upabhokta par asar padegaa or isaki khapat ghatane kii bhi ashanka he
 The solution to the problem may be that farmers adopt a multi-crop cycle
 puri duniya main brazil ke baad bharat main sabase zyada chini banati he or uski khapat bhi sabase zyada yaheen hoti he
 Then, the problems related to this are also most in this country
