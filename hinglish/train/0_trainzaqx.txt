 In Thane, the people of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena called the media and started beating in front of the cameras instead of giving a person to the police station
 inke anusaar yah ek bacchee ke saath ashleel harakatein kar rahaa tha
 If caught, the law has enough rights to take action, it had to be handed over to the law, but this group of four people turned into court

 Most of them are girls aged between 12 and 14 years

 The police have named 9 people

 Isn't it frightening that the village people cracked down on girls for opposing molestation

 On this, Justice YU Lalit distanced himself from the Constitution Bench

 unhone kaha, 'main lordship ke saamne bas yah baat laana chahta hum
 We have no objection to hearing this issue
 ab yah puri tarah se aapke upar nirbhar he
 i am sorry that and i did not want to raise this issue
 'is par sijeai ne kaha ki isamen khed jataane kii kya baat he, aapane to bas tathy bataaya he
 However, UP government lawyer Harish Salve said that he had no problem with Justice YU Lalit joining the bench
 lekin is tarah kaa maamla uthaane ke baad justise yuyuu lalit ne khud ko is masale se alag kar liya he
 Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi gave information about this
 rajeev dhawan ne iske alaava samvidhan peeth par bhi sawaal uthaa diya, unhone kaha ki ye maamla pehle 3 jajon kii peeth ke paas tha lekin achaanak 5 jajon kii peeth ke saamne maamla gaya jisko lekar koi nyaayik aadesh jari nahin kiya gaya
 However, the Supreme Court held that it is the right of the Chief Justice to constitute the Constitution Bench

 President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney had a fierce debate in the third and final match for the presidency on Monday night, from Afghanistan and Pakistan to China, Libya, Israel, Iran and the Middle East
 is bahes main bhi obama ko vijayi ghoshit kiya gaya, lekin donon ummidavaaron ke bich ladaai ab bhi kaante kii bani hui he
 In the contest just 15 days before the vote, Obama attacked Romney, saying that his rivals wanted to bring foreign policies of the 1980s, social policies of the 1950s and economic policies of the 1920s
 somvaar raat florida ke boka riten main lin university main videsh niti par hui bahes ke baad kiye gaye ek taatkaalik surveykshan main obama ko 40 pratishat ke mukaable 48 pratishat se vijayi ghoshit kiya gaya he
 But it remains to be seen how effective the third debate victory will be for Obama in the White House race, as the most recent poll shows Obama leading by a very small margin in important electoral states like Ohio
 haalia surveykshan ne washington post-abisi news ke nae surveykshan ke rukh kii pushti kii he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki rashtriya str par sambhavit matadaataaon main abhi bhi anischitata kii sthiti bani hui he, kyonki obama ko jahaan 49 pratishat matadaataaon kaa samarthan he, to romany ko 48 pratishat matadaata samarthan kar rahe hai
 Romney, however, appeared to support most of the Obama administration's move during Monday's debate
 jaise ki afghanistan se vaapasi, syria main grih yuddh or iran ko parmaanu hathiyaar hasil karne se rokane jaise kadamon kaa romany ne osama bin laden or alqaida ke anya sarganaon ko maut ke ghat utaarne ke obama ke prayaason kii prashansa kii, lekin unhone kaha ki ham apane raste ke is rode ko khatm nahin kar sakate
 Romney instead insisted on a comprehensive strategy to curb violent extremism in the Middle East
 romany ne kaha, "mukhya baat yah he ki muslim jagat khud se charamawaad ko khaarij kar de
 "simultaneously, Romney proposed the creation of American policies and institutions promoting economic development, better education, gender equality
 romany ne is baat par bhi sahmati jataai ki afghanistan main sangharsh safal rahaa he or america 2014 tak afgaan balon ko jimmedaari saunpane ke raste par he
 But he also warned that what is happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on Afghanistan's success

 In many places, people have converted their private landline phones into free PCO (public call office)

 In the Palam area of delhi, two cases of murder have come to light over a property dispute
 police ne aaropee ke khilaaf cese darj kar liya he, haalanki ab tak use giraftaar nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 According to police, the two murderers are relatives of the deceased
 bade bhai ke saath chal rahe sampatti vivaad ko lekar chote bhai ne apni hi bhabhi or bhattije kii goli markar hatya kar di
 Pramod lived with his family in Darsal Palam area
 kuch din baad hi uskaa bada bhai praveen bhi apane parivaar ke saath rahane ke liye aa gaya
 The house in Palam where the family lived, had been a dispute between the two brothers over the same house for a long time
 bataaya ja rahaa he kii ravivaar ko pramod ne sabase pehle apane bhattije ko ghar kefirst floor par goli maarior darwaja band kar makaan ke neeche apni bhabhi deepa kaa intazaar karne laga
 Her sister-in-law Deepa went to her other house at that time for some work
 deepa jaise hi palam main sthit duusare ghar par pahunchi to ghar ke neeche intjaar kar rahe pramod ne us par bhi goli chalaa di
 Deepa died on the spot outside the house
 pramod ne jab apni bhabhi deepa par goli chalaai, us samay deepa ke saath uske do bachche bhi the
 Thankfully Pramod did nothing to both the young children and escaped from the spot
 is vaardaat main deepa or uske bete rishi kii maut ho gai
 The police reached the spot after receiving information that Deepa's body was found outside the house, while the innocent child's body was found inside the flat
 is dabl murder se ilaake main sansani fail gai
 The police is investigating from all angles that Pramod was the only one involved in the crime or anyone else and the real story behind the incident is being investigated
 sabase badi adaalat ek baar phir mushkil main he, kyonki chif justise ranjan gogoi ke khilaaf sirf yon utpeedan ke hi aarope nahin balki vakil utsav bains kaa iljaam bhi he
 According to Bains, some corporate lobby chiefs are engaged in a conspiracy to defame the Justice
 is maamle main guuruuvaar ko teen jajon kii vishesh bench ne supreme court ke purv jaj justise eke patnayak ko is kathith sajeesh kii jaanch kii jimmedaari di he
 Indira Jaisingh We are happy that Justice Patnaik has been given the responsibility of investigation
 ham bhi unhen puraa sahyog karenge
 During the hearing, the court also made very strict comments, for example, the court said that the time has come when we should tell money and Bahubali, that we consider ourselves powerful, that you cannot run the institutions
 aisa samajhane vaale log aag se khel rahe hai
 It should end
 kyonki jo vyavastha durust karnaa chahta he use badnaam or khatm karne ke liye sajishein hone lagati hai
 This will not do anymore
 phixing ke aarope gambhir hai
 Do not think that fixers or rich people are running the Supreme Court
 aaj se jaanch hogi shurudusrin ore teen jajon kii inhouse cameti shuukravaar ko yon utpeedan ke aarope vaale maamle kii jaanch shuru karne vaali he
 But Justice NV Ramana, who is in this committee, has distanced himself from the hearing
 kathith peedit mahila ne supreme court main jaanch cameti ko chitthee likhakar aapatti jataai thi ki justise ramana to sijeai gogoi ke paariwarik mitra hai
 Now the CJI will issue a notification to include other judges in the panel with the opinion of all the judges, then the investigation will proceed
 yah bhi padhein: CJI cese:aaropon se lekar ection tak, jaane kya he puraa maamalaye pehla mauka nahin he jab desh ke chif justise ke khilaaf maamla saamne aayaa ho
 Just before Justice Gogoi, when Justice Deepak Mishra was CJI, there was a noise of starting the process of impeachment
 ab justise gogoi par yon utpeedan kaa
 Even then and still the image of the judiciary only deteriorates
 ye pahalu hai
 
 
 - It is alleged that the gang of fixers is trying to fix the bench in the Supreme Court
 -kya chif justise ko fansaane kii sajeesh main court ke barkhaast karmchaaree or anya log shaamil hai ?-court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki jarurat padane par justise patnayak kii madad ke liye sibiai, ibi or dilli police ke pramukh puraa sahyog karenge British scientists have claimed that a bacterium spreading from India to the world is untreated
 british vaigyanikon ne ise endm-1 naa diya he jabaki aam bolchaal main ise new dely bacteria kaha ja rahaa he
 Actually, it is a kind of enzyme which, if it gets into a bacterium, it does not affect any medicine
 yah bacteria un marijon main mila he jo bharat yaa paak se surgery karakar laute hai
 This bacteria causes a gastric problem, due to which there is a possibility of multiple organ failure and death of the patient
 iske marijon main peshaab main infections or jaise shuruaati lakshan dikh sakate hai
 British scientists have called this superbug a threat to the world
 haalanki bhartiya doctoron ne is baat ko galat bataaya he ki ye superbag bharat main paidaa hua
 They say it may have been part of western propaganda
 vahiin superbag par sansad main bhi chintaa jataai gai
 bjp's SS Ahluwalia expressed concern over the matter, saying it could also be a possible conspiracy
 congress kii jayanti natarajan ne bhi ahaluwalia kaa samarthan kiya
 At the same time, on behalf of the government, Prithviraj Chauhan said that he will get the matter investigated and submit the report
 yun to loktantr main vot kii takat sabase ahm maani jaati he
 But there is also a power of allies, which proves very decisive to reach the peak of power
 bhartiya raajnneeti ke itihaas kii yah sabase ahm kadi bhi rahi he
 This is the reason that in the election season, the resentment of coalition parties, the man-spirit of the leaders become common
 ab jabaki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kaa shankhanaad ho chukaa he, apano kii naaraazgi saamne aana bhi lajimi he
 The ruling BJP is also not untouched by this
 bijepi ke sahyogi bhi use aankh dikhaane lage hai
 After tasting the power, if someone has left the confluence, then someone wants to apply the conditions and go the way forward
 yani 50 saalon tak desh par shashan karne kaa pran le chuki bijepi ko ab apano kaa sitam chintaa main daal saktaa he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections led by Narendra Modi, the BJP created history by winning 282 seats
 yah pehla mauka tha jab bijepi ko prachand bahumat praapt hua
 The NDA government was formed on 26 May 2014 and Narendra Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister
 unke saath endie ke sahyogi shivasena or tidipi samet baaki dalon ke cote se bhi mantriyon ne shapath lee
 But as the 2019 election drew closer, the resentment of TDP and Shiv Sena came to the fore
 tidipi ne choda sathkareeb chaar saal modi sarkaar kaa hissaa rahane ke baad andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ne endie se alag hone kaa faisla kiya
 The TDP quit the BJP in March 2018, accusing it of betraying the Modi government over the demand for special state status to Andhra Pradesh
 tidipi ke cote se donon mantriyon ne bhi modi cabinet se istipha de diya
 The TDP is known as a strong regional party
 2014 main party ne 30 siton par chunaav ladaa or 16 par jeet darj kii thi
 The BJP, which was considered weak in South India, could have a big advantage of the strength of the TDP, but at present, both have different paths
 shivasena alag ladegi chunaav!vaicharik taur par bijepi ke kareeb kahi jane vaali maharashtra kii shivasena bhi apni naaraazgi kaa elaan kar chuki he
 Although both parties are running the Maharashtra government in alliance, Shiv Sena has stood in opposition to BJP on national issues like demonetisation
 donon dalon ke bich aksar khinchataan kii bayaanbaji saamne aati rahi he
 Shiv Sena has openly declared not to contest elections with BJP
 haalanki, modi sarkaar ke chaar saal puure hone ke maukey par bijepi amit shah ne mumbai jaakar shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare se mulaakaat jarur kii, lekin shivasena ke tevar abhi tak kadavaahat bhare hi najar aa rahe hai
 The Maharashtra assembly elections were held in 2014 only after the Lok Sabha elections, in which the BJP performed brilliantly
 sabase badi party banakar ubhari bijepi ko shivasena ne sahyog diya or gathbandhan kii sarkaar bani
 Talking about the equations of Lok Sabha, the state has a total of 48 seats
 2014 ke chunaav main shivasena ne inamen se 18 siton par jeet darj kii thi, jabaki bijepi ko 22 siten mili thim
 In such a situation, the departure of Shiv Sena can also give BJP a huge loss in this big state
 kashmir main chuta sathjammu-kashmir kii kshetreey party pidipi haalanki centre sarkaar main endie kaa hissaa nahin rahi, lekin 2014 ke aakhir main jab kashmir vidhansabha chunaav hue to kisi bhi dal ko bahumat praapt nahin hua
 After which BJP announced support to PDP and PDP formed government under the leadership of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed
 mufti said kii maut ke baad unki beti mahabuuba mufti ne soobe kii kaman sanbhali
 Despite the ideological differences between the two parties, this alliance lasted for four years and finally this month (june 2018) the BJP withdrew its support
 loksabhaa chunaav kii drushti se dekha jaae to jammu-kashmir main pidipi majboot sthiti main he
 The party won 3 out of 6 Lok Sabha seats in the state amid the Modi wave in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 jabaki baaki 3 siton par bijepi ne paracham laharaaya tha
 Now that the 2019 elections are near, the relationship of the two parties has already ended
 bihar main nahin ban rahi baat!bihar main jediu netaa nitish kumaar ne lalu yadav kii argedy or congress ke saath mahagathbandhan todakar phir se bijepi ke saath sarkaar banaai he
 But all is not going well between the two parties till now for the Lok Sabha elections
 siton ke bantwaare par donon partiyon ke netaaon main bayaanbaji ho rahi he
 According to media reports, while local BJP leaders are pushing the effort to contest separate elections, the JDU has clearly stated that the BJP can contest all 40 seats alone
 darasal, yahaan bijepi 2014 ke formule par siton kaa bantwaaraa chaahati he
 In 2014, BJP won 22 out of 40 seats
 party pichley loksabhaa chunaavon ke parinaam ke aadhaar par hi samjhauta karnaa chaahati he
 While JDU is considering this basis of BJP as wrong
 jediu kaa kahana he ki 2019 ko 2014 na samajha jaae
 The news is that while JDU is demanding 25 seats, BJP is not ready to fight on less than 22 seats
 haalanki, 2014 main jediu ko mahaj 2 siton par jeet mili thi
 Apart from these big parties, smaller parties also remain trapped for the BJP
 upi sarkaar main sahyogi bhartiya suheldev party ke adhyaksh om prakaash rajbhar khule taur par bijepi ke liye chunauti pesh kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, while the Congress is working on a plan to unite all the anti-bjp parties and oust Narendra Modi from power, the bjp's own players, who pledged to play a long innings, are seen to be bone of his neck

 tripura ke mukhyamantri biplab deb har din tarah-tarah kaa ‘gyaan’ baantate rahete hai, lekin rajya kii rajdhani agartala ke paas hi ek mahila ke saath aisi ghatana ghati he jise sunakar kisi kaa bhi sir shame se jhuk jayega
 Here in the name of morality contract, Khap Panchayat treated a woman with abusive behavior
 hairaani kii baat he ki ek mahila ko bhari bheed ke saamne apamaanit karne main mahilaayein hi aage raheen
 All the members are women in Khap Panchayat in Bisnab Tilla village of Dukli sub division of Western Tripura district
 is khap panchayat ne gaanv kii ekashaadishuda mahilako kisi or purush ke saath aniatik sambandh rakhane ke shaq main sabak sikhaane kii thaanee
 Then he himself punished the woman who neither the law of the country allows nor the constitution
 bataa den ki pashchimi tripura jile kaa mukhyalay agartala hi he
 Neither a police complaint nor an FIR has been lodged against the woman with whom misbehavior has been reported
 khap panchayat ne saarvajanik sthaan par sabake saamne mahila ke kapade faadane or pitayee karne kaa farmaan sunaaya
 Then the members of Khap Panchayat themselves tore, abused and first beat the woman's clothes in the presence of many men and then beat her up with shoes and slippers
 mahila bheed se raham kii guhaar lagaati rahi lekin uski kisi ne ek nahin suni
 a video of mistreatment of the woman has also surfaced
 pashchimi tripura ke espi ajit pratap singh kaa kahana he ki ek mahila ke saath badasluki hone kii jaankaree mili he or kuch mahilaon ne hi aisa kiya

 maharashtra police kosupreme courtke saamne cese diary pesh kerani hogi
 Advocates like senior lawyers Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Vrinda Grover, Anand Grover appeared on behalf of the petitioners - Sudha Bhardwaj, Gautam Navlakha, Varvara Rao, Vernon Gonzalvis and Arun Ferreira - to prevent their arrest and transit remand in the case
 sarkaar kii ore se adishnal solicytor general tushaar mehta or maharashtra police kii ore se varisht vakil harish salve ne apni daleelein rakhin
 The case is being heard by a bench of Supreme Court Chief Justice Deepak Mishra, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice AM Khanwilankar
 padhein, kya jirah hui guuruuvaar kii sunwaayee main-yachikakartaon kii ore se pesh hue vrinda grover or anand grover ne aropiyon kii 'commered prakaash ko likhi gai chitthiyon' par sawaal uthaae
 He said that Sudha Bhargava is Hindi-speaking, but the letter that is being written by him also contains Marathi words
 is chitthee ko dekhte hue bench ne tippanee kii, 'haa, yah marathibhashi hi likh saktaa he
 Also, half the moon is also used by Marathi in writing
 'isse pehle sunwaayee ke dauraan abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha, 'nau maheene ho gaye lekin maovadi hone kaa aarope laga kar bhi sarkaar transit remand ke liye arji nahin laga pai
 Now why is this step being taken suddenly? This action of the police force to arrest the accused without a court order was absolutely illegal
 ' unhone kaha ki transit remand kii arji bhima koregaanv par aadhaarit he, lekin police dwaara pesh kii ja rahi teen chitthiyon main iskaa kahin zikr nahin he
 After this, the court summoned the case diary of the police

 We do not have this facility
 harish salve ne kaha ki agar is jaanch se gaiyrkanoonee kaam karne waalon kii karatuuton kaa khulaasa ho rahaa he to jaanch aage badhani chahie
 On the demand of making SIT, he said that nowadays all the pils are requested to make sits, because the court too often orders sits by making sits
 isse pehle, harish salve ne kaha, kai maamalon main court esaiti banaati he
 This has created an image in the public that agencies like CBI, NIA are unreliable, only then the demand of sits is almost like copy-paste in almost every PIL
 sunwaayee ke dauraan singhvi ne kaha ki ek tivi channel main hue discshan main bhi in chitthiyon kaa zikr hua
 How did those letters get to the news channel? How did such confidential documents become public? When Singhvi cited the letter, Harish Salve questioned the letter coming to the petitioners
 is par singhvi ne kaha ki yah chitthee to kai samachar channelon kii website par maujuud he
 During the hearing, Justice Khanwilkar, who was involved in the bench, asked that what the material police has gathered, what is the relation of the arrested people? Meanwhile, Tushar Mehta gave the details of the dialogue between the accused
 tushaar mehta ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki prakaash chetan or ji saibaba ek hi aadmi ke naam hai
 He not only knows Hindi but also gives speeches in Hindi
 usko likhi chitthee main kai shadyantron or eastern riginal beuro (ERB) kii meeting kaa bhi zikr he
 He said that in many places in the documents received from the accused, there are such serious things which are not appropriate to read in the court
 aropiyon ke patrachaar main kai code hai
 For example, Low Intensity Combat (LIC) is called
 is par singhvi ne kaha ki agarprakash or saibaba ek hi aadmihai to koi jail main rahakar kaise chitthee likh saktaa he
 The hearing in this case has been completed and now both the parties have been asked to give their reply in writing

 jitne sandesh dene vaale hai unase bachakar rahen
 
 
 Poet Surendra Sharma said that i want to give a message, avoid all those who are going to deliver the message
 apana nirnay khud lenge to behatar jindagi ji sakenge
 i want to ask who created the varna system
 agar ram sabari ke juthe ber kha sakate hai to sabari ram ke mandir main kyon nahin ja sakati
 Surendra Sharma said that don't make fun of a poor person in life because everything is important for God

 'arun jaimini ne kaha ki haryana ke log raajnneeti par zyada baat nahin karte hai, sirf raajnneeti karte hai
 While narrating an anecdote, Jamini said, 'A snake was biting Netaji, then a man said that Netaji is not biting a snake, is poisoning himself
 dilli mahila ayog ne nirmal chaaya complex main sthit bager home (bhikshu grih) main sudhaar ke liye dilli sarkaar ko apni siforishein bhej di hai
 The Commission has recommended strict action against the officials, responsible for the poor condition of this home
 pichhali maheene 4 janvari ko dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne apni team ke saath bager home kaa auchak nirikshan kiya tha
 The Chairman of the Commission spent the whole night inspecting the living arrangements and cleanliness etc
 in the home in Bagher and found many flaws
 iske baad 8 farvari ko bhi unhone subah 5 baje vahaan kaa daura kiya tha
 During its inspection, the team of the Commission also found violation of human rights there
 iske baad ek maheene tak jaanch-padtaal kii gai or ab sudhaar ke liye dilli sarkaar ko apni sifarish bhej di hai
 During surprise inspections, the Commission came to know that when foreign women come to the Bagher Home, Castafa checks her private part there which is a direct human rights violation
 is baat kii pushti vahaan ke staff ne bhi kii thi
 The Commission, in its recommendation, has asked to close such investigation with immediate effect
 saath hi vahaan jaanch ke liye upkaran lagavane kii baat kahi he
 The Commission had found in its investigation that mentally disabled women prepare food for other women living in bagger homes
 aashaa jyoti home or bager home kii rasoi ek hi he
 a cook and an assistant prepare food for 80 women living in Bagger Home and Asha Jyoti
 khaanaa banane vaali mahilaayein bhi saaf-safai kaa dhyaan nahin rakhti hai
 The Commission recommends that sufficient numbers of cooks and assistants be appointed for the Bagger Home and that food from mentally challenged women be stopped with immediate effect
 ayog kii team ne nirikshan main paaya ki vahaan rahane vaali videshi mahilaon kopahnane ke liye paryaapt kapade bhi nahin die jate hai
 An Uzbek woman said that she has not changed clothes since 22 days because she has not been given other clothes to wear
 iske alaava ayog ne paaya ki yahaan sone ke liye gadde bhi nahin muhaiyaa karaaye gaye hai
 The Commission recommended that they be provided with sufficient clothes to wear and mattresses for sleeping
 bager home ko kai saalon se videshi mahilaon ko tehraane ke liye ditten home kii tarah prayog main laayaa ja rahaa he
 The Home Ministry and any other department has not shown any interest on what kind of detained home should be for them to live
 iske alaava bager home main rahane vaali ek mahila ne ayog ke nirikshan ke dauraan shikaayat kii thi ki fornar riginal registration officer (epararo) ne uske saath chhedchhad kii he
 There is no system of complaint resolution here
 ayog ne apni sifarish main likhaa he ki bager home main sudhaar ke liye sambandhit vibhaagon se charchaa karke ek niyamavali banani chahie
 Also, police assistance should be taken if necessary for redressal of grievances
 bager home main biimaar or garbhvatee mahilaon kii dekhbhaal or unke khanpan ke liye koi alag se vyavastha nahin kii gai he
 The Commission believes that it is necessary to have special arrangements for the care and catering of such women
 nirmal chaaya complex main alag-alag grihon main rahane vaali ladakiyon or mahilaon kii sankhya lagbhag 1500 he lekin in sabhi kii dekhbhaal or jaanch ke liye sirf 2 doctor hi hai
 In the recommendation given to improve Nari Niketan, the Commission had also said to increase the number of doctors
 ayog ne nirikshan ke dauraan paaya ki yahaan bane tailet bahut gande hai
 There was a bad condition with the smell
 saaf safai ke liye sirf ek karmchaaree tha
 Surprisingly, the Social Welfare Department has also accepted in its reply that there is only one sweeper at Bagger Home and Asha Jyoti Home
 yah bahut hi nindaneey he ki department ko bhi is baat kii jaankaree he ki vahaan saaf safai ke liye staff kii kami he lekin phir bhi staff kii kami ko puraa nahin kiya gaya he
 The Commission in its recommendation has asked to remove the shortage of scavengers staff as soon as possible
 ayog ne paaya he ki is home main pani kibhi kaaphi kami he jis vajah se vahaan rahane vaali mahilaayein sahi se naha bhi nahin paati hai or unhen allergy ho gai he
 The Commission believes that if the department inspects these homes from time to time, then small problems of this kind will automatically go away
 ayog ke nirikshan ke baad soshal welfare department se jo jawaab aayaa he usamen kaha gaya he ki epararo ditension centre (bager home) chalaane kaa icchhuk nahin he
 For this, the department has written several times that its employees are unable to keep foreign nationals
 isliye epararo ko alag se ek ditension centre bananaa chahie or usamen videshi mahilaon ko rakhana chahie
 But in 2014, a meeting was held under the chairmanship of the Lieutenant Governor in which it was decided that the social welfare department would be responsible for running the three detention centers run by the FRRO
 ayog kaa bhi maananaa he ki soshal welfare department ko hi ditension centre chalaanaa chahie
 The commission found, after its inspection and investigation, that the monitoring of the bagger home was negligible
 2014 main tatkaaleen soshal welfare sachiv satbir bedi or 2015 main isi vibhaag ke nideshak ne aakhri baar is home kaa daura kiya tha
 The Commission believes that the senior most officer of the department should visit these places once a month
 saath hi inaki nigaraanee ke liye sisitivi jaise upkaran lagane kii zarurat bhi bataai gai he
 Are there false firs against judges, magistrates, officers, mps and mlas only in Rajasthan or anywhere in India? If there are false firs against these influential people, then how many firs will there be against common people? What should a government do in such a situation? Should we first protect the common people or the officers? Such questions have started to arise about the bill introduced by the Rajasthan government in the Assembly on 23 October daily
 yah vidheyak agar kanoon bana to koi maamla ujagar hone par tab tak report nahin ho sakegi jab tak sarkaar exiaar darj karne kii anumati nahin degi
 If she does not give permission in 6 months, then she will not give the reason why the permission was not given
 is dauraan deree kaa laabh kise milegaa ye aap samaj sakate hai
 If you want, you can also understand that the government will not allow firs for 180 days
 to khabar lekar gum rahe us patrkaar ke saath kya-kya ho saktaa he
 During 6 months, the evidence will disappear and arrangements will be made for the newswriter
 kya aap ye chaahate hai? When this bill was introduced on Monday, Congress leaders were demonstrating outside the House by putting a black band on the mouth
 congress netaa sachin payalat ne kaha he ki unke netaaon ne bhi sadan ke bheetar virodh kiya he
 Pilot says that this is black law and the government wants to dictate
 congress bhi halchal main tabhi ai jab media ke ek hisse main prastaavit vidheyak ko lekar sawaal uthne lage
 When the Rajasthan government brought the ordinance last month, where was the opposition from September 7 to October 20
 bijepi ke bhavani singh rajaavat, maanakachand surana or ghanashyam tiwadi ne iske prastaavon kaa virodh kiya he
 Ghanshyam Tiwari walked out of the house
 ghanashyam tiwadi ne sarkaar ke daawey ko chunauti di he ki yah sanshodhan eemaandaar afasaron ko kavach pehanaane ke liye laayaa ja rahaa he
 Tiwari has said whether the government has a list of which officials are honest and which are not
 vidheyak pesh karte hue grahamantri gulabchand kataaria ne kaha he ki zarurat padi to ve sanshodhan ke liye taiyaar hai
 The Lokpal Act was passed on December 18, 2013
 24 aktubar, 2017 tak lokapal niyukt hi nahin hua he
 Otherwise, there would have been a facility to approach the Lokpal with a complaint of corruption against any officer or judge
 chaalaaki se lokapal ke masale ko gaayab kar diya gaya he
 Now the Rajasthan government wants to retain the right of permission for the FIR in the case of corruption
 yah vidheyak agar kanoon bana to rajasthan main lokayukta ke kya adhikaar rah jaaenge, kya is kanoon ke zarie lokayukta ko bhi beasar kiya ja rahaa he? yahi nahin jab tak sarkaar anumati nahin degi, court bhi exiaar ke aadesh nahin de sakati he
 Did the government not trust the court? What will be the meaning of the information received from RTI, first you get information of corruption from the same government, then you go to the same government that FIR can be obtained against such and such officer
 yah bhi to ho saktaa he ki sarkaar vipaksh ke maamle main mukadmaa daayar karne kii anumati degi, apane vidhayakon ke maamle main anumati hi nahin degi
 Rajasthan government has issued a press release on 21 October
 rajya sarkaar ne apni press relies main kaha he - kyonki dhara 156 (3) main adaalat ke madhyam se police thanon main adhiktar chhavi karaab karne, nicha dikhaane or vyaktigat dushmani ke kaaran kisi bhi pratishthit or bade se bade locasevak ke khilaaf mukademen darj karvaa die jate hai or media main unke khilaaf khabar chap jaati he
 Due to this the image of the public servant gets tarnished and he has to do the same thing with mental anguish and false slander
 baad main aise adhikansh prakaran jhuthe paae jate hai
 For example, out of all the cases filed in 156 (3) between 2013 and 2017, about 73 percent of the cases were filed by the police in the FR (final Report)
 yani is avadhi main kareeb 73 fisadi logon ko juthi badanaami kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Despite not being guilty, he not only suffered mental anguish but also the time of court and executive was passed
 kya jin 73 pratishat logon ko juthi badanaami kaa saamana karnaa padaa, unamem sirf vidhayak, saansad, afasar, magistrate or jaj hi the? sarkaar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie tha ki is 73 fisadi main kitne aam log hai
 No information has been given to the government where this data came from
 sarkaar ke paas exiaar se pehle jaanch karaane kii koun si agency hogi, isaki bhi koi soochna nahin he
 Then what is the point of being a policeman? kya jajon, magistrate, afasaron or saansadon ke liye alag police banane ja rahi he, unke liye alag se jaanch agency hogi? mat bhuuliye ki sarkaar kii agenciyaan bhi nagarikon ke khilaaf jhuthe mukademe darj kara detii hai, aatank ke maamle main 20-20 saal noujvaan farji mukademon main fansaa kar jail main rakhe gaye hai
 Why this bill is not mentioned in this bill
 sarkaar ne jhuthe mukademe daayar karaane vaale afasaron ke khilaaf do saal kii jail kaa praavdhaan kyon nahin rakhaa he
 False cases are not against the councilor, the head, the members of the Zilla Parishad, why have they been dropped? rashtriya aparaadh shodh shakha beuro ke 2015 ke aankade ke mutabik, 2015 main ipisi ke tahat darj 40 lakh, 10 hazaar, 195 maamle darj kiye gaye
 Of these, 1 lakh, 13 thousand, 388 cases were found to be false
 kul exiaar kaa 3 pratishat bhi nahin he
 From where did the Rajasthan government get 73 percent of the data, do only false firs are registered in Rajasthan
 vaise rajasthan sarkaar kii press release main bahut chaalaaki se likhaa gaya he
 It is not clearly written anywhere that 73 per cent false firs have been filed
 ek baar or graphics par nigaah daalate hai
 If you do not look at the government's words carefully, then when the breaker will come in the middle of the road, you will not know and your head will hit the roof of the car
 press relies main kaha gaya he ki 2013 se 2017 ke bich jitne bhi mukademe 156(3) main darj hue hai
 About 73 percent of them have frs (final report) by the police
 press relies main yah nahin kaha ki police ne final report main 73 fisadi exiaar ko jhootha paaya he
 It has said that in 73 percent of the cases, a final report has been submitted
 is avadhi main kareeb 73 fisadi logon ko juthi badanaami kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Despite being guilty, he not only suffered mental anguish
 exiaar hone se 73 hi nahin 100 fisadi logon ko maansik santaap jhelana padataa he
 From this statement, it seems that there are 27 percent who are happy with the FIR, they do not have any kind of trouble
 yah vidheyak media ke kilaaf bhi he
 Unless the government allows the FIR, the media cannot name the officer, MP or MLA in its report
 pahchaan bhi bataa degaa to do saal kii jail
 Nowhere is it written in the First Information Report that what is written is evidence or verdict
 itnaa hi matlab hota he ki police is maamle main tatkaal jaanch shuru kare
 The Editors Guild states that they were brought directly to protect the judiciary and bureaucracy from false firs
 asaliyat main ye media ko tang karne, naukarshahon ke galat kaamon ko chupaane or samvidhan dwaara di gai press kii azaadi par lagaam lagane kaa ghaatak hathiyaar he
 The Editors Guild wants the Rajasthan government to immediately withdraw the ordinance and abstain from enacting it
 farzi or jhuthe muqadamon ke kilaaf sakht qadam uthaa kar sazaa dene ke bajaae rajasthan sarkaar aisa adhyadesh laai he jo sandeshvahak ko chup karana chahta he
 The Editors Guild also said that this step of the Rajasthan government is harsh and it gives an open leeway to arrest the journalists who are reporting the public interest
 sansad ne 1970 main nai siarpisi code banaaya tha, isamen likhaa he ki koi vyakti jo ki jaj he yaa magistrate he yaa locasevak he, jise bina sarkaar kii manzuri ke nahin hataaya ja saktaa he, agar wo kisi aparaadh main shaamil paaya jane kaa aaropee banataa he tab bina manzuri ke adaalat uske khilaaf sangyaan nahin legi

 Information obtained from RTI to the reporter reveals that an officer in a department has misappropriated 200 crores
 ab vah khabar kaise likhegaa kyonki do saal kii jail se bachanaa bhi he
 Dear audience and dear reader, let us together walk the banks of the lake and try to understand this news using our own imaginations
 200 karod ke kathith rup se hue is gaban kaa sambandh us vaale saansad se lagata he jo us rose dilli se aae us mantri ke bagal main baithe the or chaay nahin pi rahe the, usee vaale saansad ke us kareebi adhikari ne unke kehane par niyamon ko todaa or us vaale vidhayak ke kareebi thekedaar ko 200 karod kaa theka de diya
 We know enough that the department is in a government building where the scam has taken place
 jisamen sau kamare hai or jinamein ek hazaar karmchaaree baithte hai
 In one of these rooms sits the officer who allegedly scammed 200 crores
 is ghotaale main uske rishtedaar bhi kathith rup se shaamil hai magar ham naam bataa denge to 2 saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 In which city, in which case, what is the scam, if we tell this much, then it will be known who is that department, who is the secretary of that department, who is the minister of that department, and we have two years Will be jailed aapako pataa na chale isliye ham bataa rahe hai ki maamla jaipur se uttar disha main sthit ek vibhaag kaa he jiskaa naam a he, sachiv kaa naam ba he or mantri kaa naam sa he, ghotaale kii raashi da he
 That officer of that department located in that building has allegedly done a scam of 200 crores in that case, which has happened in Bihar
 phir bhi kis imaarat main sthit kis vibhaag ke kis afasar ne kis maamle main 200 karod kaa wo vaala ghotaalaa kiya he, ye jaanane ke liye aapako 6 maheene kaa intazaar karnaa hoga, kyonki jab tak sarkaar apni jaanch ke baad exiaar karne kii anumati nahin degi, ham isse zyada nahin bataa sakate
 That's why little is written to understand more
 agar, exiaar kii anumati nahin mili to samajhie ki us imaarat main sthit us vibhaag ke us afasar ne us maamle main 200 karod kaa ghotaalaa nahin kiya he
 Is it not possible that instead of doing so much, governments should pass a law that only Lori will be printed in the press
 tivi main ankar loriyaan sunaayenge
 The BJP has an absolute majority, the way it brought the ordinance, it can also pass it
 abhi yah hota tha ki agar police exiaar nahin kar sakati to koi court jaakar aadesh le aata tha or jaanch shuru ho jaati thi
 But if this bill is passed, then even the court will not allow it
 yah zarur he ki agar rajya sarkaar chah maheene main injazat nahin detii he to ye mana jayega ki ijazat mil gai he, yahi nahin vidheyak main yah bhi likhaa he ki sarkaar ko apane faisale ke liye koi kaaran bataane kii zarurat nahin hogi
 The name of the MP and MLA is, the Chief Minister is not, so can there be an FIR against the Chief Minister or if the Chief Minister is also an MLA or is there, then the FIR will have to be approved against him

 kya aap ye chaahate hai? When this bill was introduced on Monday, Congress leaders were demonstrating outside the House by putting a black band on the mouth
 congress netaa sachin payalat ne kaha he ki unke netaaon ne bhi sadan ke bheetar virodh kiya he
 Pilot says that this is black law and the government wants to dictate
 congress bhi halchal main tabhi ai jab media ke ek hisse main prastaavit vidheyak ko lekar sawaal uthne lage
 When the Rajasthan government brought the ordinance last month, where was the opposition from September 7 to October 20
 bijepi ke bhavani singh rajaavat, maanakachand surana or ghanashyam tiwadi ne iske prastaavon kaa virodh kiya he
 Ghanshyam Tiwari walked out of the house
 ghanashyam tiwadi ne sarkaar ke daawey ko chunauti di he ki yah sanshodhan eemaandaar afasaron ko kavach pehanaane ke liye laayaa ja rahaa he
 Tiwari has said whether the government has a list of which officials are honest and which are not

 The Lokpal Act was passed on December 18, 2013
 24 aktubar, 2017 tak lokapal niyukt hi nahin hua he
 Otherwise, there would have been a facility to approach the Lokpal with a complaint of corruption against any officer or judge
 chaalaaki se lokapal ke masale ko gaayab kar diya gaya he
 Now the Rajasthan government wants to retain the right of permission for the FIR in the case of corruption
 yah vidheyak agar kanoon bana to rajasthan main lokayukta ke kya adhikaar rah jaaenge, kya is kanoon ke zarie lokayukta ko bhi beasar kiya ja rahaa he? yahi nahin jab tak sarkaar anumati nahin degi, court bhi exiaar ke aadesh nahin de sakati he
 Did the government not trust the court? What will be the meaning of the information received from RTI, first you get information of corruption from the same government, then you go to the same government that FIR can be obtained against such and such officer
 yah bhi to ho saktaa he ki sarkaar vipaksh ke maamle main mukadmaa daayar karne kii anumati degi, apane vidhayakon ke maamle main anumati hi nahin degi
 Rajasthan government has issued a press release on 21 October
 rajya sarkaar ne apni press relies main kaha he - kyonki dhara 156 (3) main adaalat ke madhyam se police thanon main adhiktar chhavi karaab karne, nicha dikhaane or vyaktigat dushmani ke kaaran kisi bhi pratishthit or bade se bade locasevak ke khilaaf mukademen darj karvaa die jate hai or media main unke khilaaf khabar chap jaati he
 Due to this the image of the public servant gets tarnished and he has to do the same thing with mental anguish and false slander
 baad main aise adhikansh prakaran jhuthe paae jate hai
 For example, out of all the cases filed in 156 (3) between 2013 and 2017, about 73 percent of the cases were filed by the police in the FR (final Report)
 yani is avadhi main kareeb 73 fisadi logon ko juthi badanaami kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Despite not being guilty, he not only suffered mental anguish but also the time of court and executive was passed
 kya jin 73 pratishat logon ko juthi badanaami kaa saamana karnaa padaa, unamem sirf vidhayak, saansad, afasar, magistrate or jaj hi the? sarkaar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie tha ki is 73 fisadi main kitne aam log hai
 No information has been given to the government where this data came from
 sarkaar ke paas exiaar se pehle jaanch karaane kii koun si agency hogi, isaki bhi koi soochna nahin he
 Then what is the point of being a policeman? kya jajon, magistrate, afasaron or saansadon ke liye alag police banane ja rahi he, unke liye alag se jaanch agency hogi? mat bhuuliye ki sarkaar kii agenciyaan bhi nagarikon ke khilaaf jhuthe mukademe darj kara detii hai, aatank ke maamle main 20-20 saal noujvaan farji mukademon main fansaa kar jail main rakhe gaye hai
 Why this bill is not mentioned in this bill
 sarkaar ne jhuthe mukademe daayar karaane vaale afasaron ke khilaaf do saal kii jail kaa praavdhaan kyon nahin rakhaa he
 False cases are not against the councilor, the head, the members of the Zilla Parishad, why have they been dropped? rashtriya aparaadh shodh shakha beuro ke 2015 ke aankade ke mutabik, 2015 main ipisi ke tahat darj 40 lakh, 10 hazaar, 195 maamle darj kiye gaye
 Of these, 1 lakh, 13 thousand, 388 cases were found to be false
 kul exiaar kaa 3 pratishat bhi nahin he
 From where did the Rajasthan government get 73 percent of the data, do only false firs are registered in Rajasthan
 vaise rajasthan sarkaar kii press release main bahut chaalaaki se likhaa gaya he
 It is not clearly written anywhere that 73 per cent false firs have been filed
 ek baar or graphics par nigaah daalate hai
 If you do not look at the government's words carefully, then when the breaker will come in the middle of the road, you will not know and your head will hit the roof of the car
 press relies main kaha gaya he ki 2013 se 2017 ke bich jitne bhi mukademe 156(3) main darj hue hai
 About 73 percent of them have frs (final report) by the police
 press relies main yah nahin kaha ki police ne final report main 73 fisadi exiaar ko jhootha paaya he
 It has said that in 73 percent of the cases, a final report has been submitted
 is avadhi main kareeb 73 fisadi logon ko juthi badanaami kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Despite being guilty, he not only suffered mental anguish
 exiaar hone se 73 hi nahin 100 fisadi logon ko maansik santaap jhelana padataa he
 From this statement, it seems that there are 27 percent who are happy with the FIR, they do not have any kind of trouble
 yah vidheyak media ke kilaaf bhi he
 Unless the government allows the FIR, the media cannot name the officer, MP or MLA in its report
 pahchaan bhi bataa degaa to do saal kii jail
 Nowhere is it written in the First Information Report that what is written is evidence or verdict
 itnaa hi matlab hota he ki police is maamle main tatkaal jaanch shuru kare
 The Editors Guild states that they were brought directly to protect the judiciary and bureaucracy from false firs
 asaliyat main ye media ko tang karne, naukarshahon ke galat kaamon ko chupaane or samvidhan dwaara di gai press kii azaadi par lagaam lagane kaa ghaatak hathiyaar he
 The Editors Guild wants the Rajasthan government to immediately withdraw the ordinance and abstain from enacting it
 farzi or jhuthe muqadamon ke kilaaf sakht qadam uthaa kar sazaa dene ke bajaae rajasthan sarkaar aisa adhyadesh laai he jo sandeshvahak ko chup karana chahta he
 The Editors Guild also said that this step of the Rajasthan government is harsh and it gives an open leeway to arrest the journalists who are reporting the public interest
 sansad ne 1970 main nai siarpisi code banaaya tha, isamen likhaa he ki koi vyakti jo ki jaj he yaa magistrate he yaa locasevak he, jise bina sarkaar kii manzuri ke nahin hataaya ja saktaa he, agar wo kisi aparaadh main shaamil paaya jane kaa aaropee banataa he tab bina manzuri ke adaalat uske khilaaf sangyaan nahin legi
 Not only this, before the introduction of the bill, the Rajasthan government has taken approval of the ordinance from the President

 agar, exiaar kii anumati nahin mili to samajhie ki us imaarat main sthit us vibhaag ke us afasar ne us maamle main 200 karod kaa ghotaalaa nahin kiya he
 Is it not possible that instead of doing so much, governments should pass a law that only Lori will be printed in the press
 tivi main ankar loriyaan sunaayenge
 The BJP has an absolute majority, the way it brought the ordinance, it can also pass it
 abhi yah hota tha ki agar police exiaar nahin kar sakati to koi court jaakar aadesh le aata tha or jaanch shuru ho jaati thi
 But if this bill is passed, then even the court will not allow it
 yah zarur he ki agar rajya sarkaar chah maheene main injazat nahin detii he to ye mana jayega ki ijazat mil gai he, yahi nahin vidheyak main yah bhi likhaa he ki sarkaar ko apane faisale ke liye koi kaaran bataane kii zarurat nahin hogi
 The name of the MP and MLA is, the Chief Minister is not, so can there be an FIR against the Chief Minister or if the Chief Minister is also an MLA or is there, then the FIR will have to be approved against him
 uttar pradesh main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko lekar aisa hi ek maamla elahabaad court main lambit he
 In this regard, we are resorting to a report in March 2017 by Scroll
in which states that the Akhilesh government did not allow the prosecution of Yogi Adityanath
 grahamantralay bhi mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke adheen he to kya ve apane kilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati denge?tippaniyan The case dates back to 2007, as an MP he is alleged to have incited violence and hatred
 gorakhpur ke patrkaar parvaiz paravaaz ne ek exiaar darj karai thi jisamen mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kaa bhi naam tha magar sarkaar ne mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati nahin di
 Since July 10, 2015, the case is awaiting permission
 saat saal main bhi antim faisla nahin hua he
 While the crime branch has completed the investigation
 court main sarkaar ke faisle kaa bachaav karte hue mukhya sachiv ne kaha tha ki parvaiz ne jo sidi jamaa karai thi usamen chhedchhad hui he
 It is not appropriate to comment more as the matter is in court
 dainik jaagran ne likhaa he ki 23 aktubar ko is maamle main sunwaayee hui
 The dock media is engaged in hymns and food, now the law will be made, then everyone will be relaxed that they will not be reported or else they will be jailed, but think from the eyes of the common man, what will happen to them if false cases are against you, Is your problem less than any MP or MLA or officer, the government has an army of lawyers to fight their case, what do you have
 karja, puja or koi nahin he duja
 What if there is no attack on the freedom of the press
 agar juthi exiaar likhaai ja rahi he to iskaa upaay yah hona chahie do chaar logon ke khilaaf exiaar likhavana mushkil kar do or baaki kaa unke haal par chhod do
 The Lokpal Act was passed on December 18, 2013
 24 aktubar, 2017 tak lokapal niyukt hi nahin hua he
 Otherwise, there would have been a facility to approach the Lokpal with a complaint of corruption against any officer or judge
 chaalaaki se lokapal ke masale ko gaayab kar diya gaya he
 Now the Rajasthan government wants to retain the right of permission for the FIR in the case of corruption
 yah vidheyak agar kanoon bana to rajasthan main lokayukta ke kya adhikaar rah jaaenge, kya is kanoon ke zarie lokayukta ko bhi beasar kiya ja rahaa he? yahi nahin jab tak sarkaar anumati nahin degi, court bhi exiaar ke aadesh nahin de sakati he
 Did the government not trust the court? What will be the meaning of the information received from RTI, first you get information of corruption from the same government, then you go to the same government that FIR can be obtained against such and such officer
 yah bhi to ho saktaa he ki sarkaar vipaksh ke maamle main mukadmaa daayar karne kii anumati degi, apane vidhayakon ke maamle main anumati hi nahin degi
 Rajasthan government has issued a press release on 21 October
 rajya sarkaar ne apni press relies main kaha he - kyonki dhara 156 (3) main adaalat ke madhyam se police thanon main adhiktar chhavi karaab karne, nicha dikhaane or vyaktigat dushmani ke kaaran kisi bhi pratishthit or bade se bade locasevak ke khilaaf mukademen darj karvaa die jate hai or media main unke khilaaf khabar chap jaati he
 Due to this the image of the public servant gets tarnished and he has to do the same thing with mental anguish and false slander
 baad main aise adhikansh prakaran jhuthe paae jate hai
 For example, out of all the cases filed in 156 (3) between 2013 and 2017, about 73 percent of the cases were filed by the police in the FR (final Report)
 yani is avadhi main kareeb 73 fisadi logon ko juthi badanaami kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Despite not being guilty, he not only suffered mental anguish but also the time of court and executive was passed
 kya jin 73 pratishat logon ko juthi badanaami kaa saamana karnaa padaa, unamem sirf vidhayak, saansad, afasar, magistrate or jaj hi the? sarkaar ko yah bhi bataanaa chahie tha ki is 73 fisadi main kitne aam log hai
 No information has been given to the government where this data came from
 sarkaar ke paas exiaar se pehle jaanch karaane kii koun si agency hogi, isaki bhi koi soochna nahin he
 Then what is the point of being a policeman? kya jajon, magistrate, afasaron or saansadon ke liye alag police banane ja rahi he, unke liye alag se jaanch agency hogi? mat bhuuliye ki sarkaar kii agenciyaan bhi nagarikon ke khilaaf jhuthe mukademe darj kara detii hai, aatank ke maamle main 20-20 saal noujvaan farji mukademon main fansaa kar jail main rakhe gaye hai
 Why this bill is not mentioned in this bill
 sarkaar ne jhuthe mukademe daayar karaane vaale afasaron ke khilaaf do saal kii jail kaa praavdhaan kyon nahin rakhaa he
 False cases are not against the councilor, the head, the members of the Zilla Parishad, why have they been dropped? rashtriya aparaadh shodh shakha beuro ke 2015 ke aankade ke mutabik, 2015 main ipisi ke tahat darj 40 lakh, 10 hazaar, 195 maamle darj kiye gaye
 Of these, 1 lakh, 13 thousand, 388 cases were found to be false
 kul exiaar kaa 3 pratishat bhi nahin he
 From where did the Rajasthan government get 73 percent of the data, do only false firs are registered in Rajasthan
 vaise rajasthan sarkaar kii press release main bahut chaalaaki se likhaa gaya he
 It is not clearly written anywhere that 73 per cent false firs have been filed
 ek baar or graphics par nigaah daalate hai
 If you do not look at the government's words carefully, then when the breaker will come in the middle of the road, you will not know and your head will hit the roof of the car
 press relies main kaha gaya he ki 2013 se 2017 ke bich jitne bhi mukademe 156(3) main darj hue hai
 About 73 percent of them have frs (final report) by the police
 press relies main yah nahin kaha ki police ne final report main 73 fisadi exiaar ko jhootha paaya he
 It has said that in 73 percent of the cases, a final report has been submitted
 is avadhi main kareeb 73 fisadi logon ko juthi badanaami kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Despite being guilty, he not only suffered mental anguish
 exiaar hone se 73 hi nahin 100 fisadi logon ko maansik santaap jhelana padataa he
 From this statement, it seems that there are 27 percent who are happy with the FIR, they do not have any kind of trouble
 yah vidheyak media ke kilaaf bhi he
 Unless the government allows the FIR, the media cannot name the officer, MP or MLA in its report
 pahchaan bhi bataa degaa to do saal kii jail
 Nowhere is it written in the First Information Report that what is written is evidence or verdict
 itnaa hi matlab hota he ki police is maamle main tatkaal jaanch shuru kare
 The Editors Guild states that they were brought directly to protect the judiciary and bureaucracy from false firs
 asaliyat main ye media ko tang karne, naukarshahon ke galat kaamon ko chupaane or samvidhan dwaara di gai press kii azaadi par lagaam lagane kaa ghaatak hathiyaar he
 The Editors Guild wants the Rajasthan government to immediately withdraw the ordinance and abstain from enacting it
 farzi or jhuthe muqadamon ke kilaaf sakht qadam uthaa kar sazaa dene ke bajaae rajasthan sarkaar aisa adhyadesh laai he jo sandeshvahak ko chup karana chahta he
 The Editors Guild also said that this step of the Rajasthan government is harsh and it gives an open leeway to arrest the journalists who are reporting the public interest
 sansad ne 1970 main nai siarpisi code banaaya tha, isamen likhaa he ki koi vyakti jo ki jaj he yaa magistrate he yaa locasevak he, jise bina sarkaar kii manzuri ke nahin hataaya ja saktaa he, agar wo kisi aparaadh main shaamil paaya jane kaa aaropee banataa he tab bina manzuri ke adaalat uske khilaaf sangyaan nahin legi
 Not only this, before the introduction of the bill, the Rajasthan government has taken approval of the ordinance from the President
 adhyadesh laayaa bhi ja chukaa he or ise kanoon banane ke liye vidhaan sabha main pesh kiya gaya he
 The People's Union for Civil Liberties has announced to challenge this bill in the Rajasthan High Court
 is bill ke khilaaf rajasthan ke vakil ek ke jain ne adaalat main yachika daayar kii he
 Suppose this bill passes without amendment
 uske baad kisi ghotaale kii reporting kaise hogi
 Will the reporter sit with the news for 180 days, go to the government that if you give FIR permission, we will print
 pleez, aap 180 din tak lataka dijie taaki ghotalebaz hamen or saboot donon ko saaf kar de
 i still offer a sample of how reporting will occur
 namoona to nahin he balki puraa kaa puraa kapade kaa thaan he

 Dear audience and dear reader, let us together walk the banks of the lake and try to understand this news using our own imaginations

 exiaar hone se 73 hi nahin 100 fisadi logon ko maansik santaap jhelana padataa he
 From this statement, it seems that there are 27 percent who are happy with the FIR, they do not have any kind of trouble
 yah vidheyak media ke kilaaf bhi he
 Unless the government allows the FIR, the media cannot name the officer, MP or MLA in its report
 pahchaan bhi bataa degaa to do saal kii jail
 Nowhere is it written in the First Information Report that what is written is evidence or verdict
 itnaa hi matlab hota he ki police is maamle main tatkaal jaanch shuru kare
 The Editors Guild states that they were brought directly to protect the judiciary and bureaucracy from false firs
 asaliyat main ye media ko tang karne, naukarshahon ke galat kaamon ko chupaane or samvidhan dwaara di gai press kii azaadi par lagaam lagane kaa ghaatak hathiyaar he
 The Editors Guild wants the Rajasthan government to immediately withdraw the ordinance and abstain from enacting it
 farzi or jhuthe muqadamon ke kilaaf sakht qadam uthaa kar sazaa dene ke bajaae rajasthan sarkaar aisa adhyadesh laai he jo sandeshvahak ko chup karana chahta he
 The Editors Guild also said that this step of the Rajasthan government is harsh and it gives an open leeway to arrest the journalists who are reporting the public interest
 sansad ne 1970 main nai siarpisi code banaaya tha, isamen likhaa he ki koi vyakti jo ki jaj he yaa magistrate he yaa locasevak he, jise bina sarkaar kii manzuri ke nahin hataaya ja saktaa he, agar wo kisi aparaadh main shaamil paaya jane kaa aaropee banataa he tab bina manzuri ke adaalat uske khilaaf sangyaan nahin legi
 Not only this, before the introduction of the bill, the Rajasthan government has taken approval of the ordinance from the President
 adhyadesh laayaa bhi ja chukaa he or ise kanoon banane ke liye vidhaan sabha main pesh kiya gaya he
 The People's Union for Civil Liberties has announced to challenge this bill in the Rajasthan High Court
 is bill ke khilaaf rajasthan ke vakil ek ke jain ne adaalat main yachika daayar kii he
 Suppose this bill passes without amendment
 uske baad kisi ghotaale kii reporting kaise hogi
 Will the reporter sit with the news for 180 days, go to the government that if you give FIR permission, we will print
 pleez, aap 180 din tak lataka dijie taaki ghotalebaz hamen or saboot donon ko saaf kar de
 i still offer a sample of how reporting will occur
 namoona to nahin he balki puraa kaa puraa kapade kaa thaan he
 Information obtained from RTI to the reporter reveals that an officer in a department has misappropriated 200 crores
 ab vah khabar kaise likhegaa kyonki do saal kii jail se bachanaa bhi he
 Dear audience and dear reader, let us together walk the banks of the lake and try to understand this news using our own imaginations
 200 karod ke kathith rup se hue is gaban kaa sambandh us vaale saansad se lagata he jo us rose dilli se aae us mantri ke bagal main baithe the or chaay nahin pi rahe the, usee vaale saansad ke us kareebi adhikari ne unke kehane par niyamon ko todaa or us vaale vidhayak ke kareebi thekedaar ko 200 karod kaa theka de diya
 We know enough that the department is in a government building where the scam has taken place
 jisamen sau kamare hai or jinamein ek hazaar karmchaaree baithte hai
 In one of these rooms sits the officer who allegedly scammed 200 crores
 is ghotaale main uske rishtedaar bhi kathith rup se shaamil hai magar ham naam bataa denge to 2 saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 In which city, in which case, what is the scam, if we tell this much, then it will be known who is that department, who is the secretary of that department, who is the minister of that department, and we have two years Will be jailed aapako pataa na chale isliye ham bataa rahe hai ki maamla jaipur se uttar disha main sthit ek vibhaag kaa he jiskaa naam a he, sachiv kaa naam ba he or mantri kaa naam sa he, ghotaale kii raashi da he
 That officer of that department located in that building has allegedly done a scam of 200 crores in that case, which has happened in Bihar
 phir bhi kis imaarat main sthit kis vibhaag ke kis afasar ne kis maamle main 200 karod kaa wo vaala ghotaalaa kiya he, ye jaanane ke liye aapako 6 maheene kaa intazaar karnaa hoga, kyonki jab tak sarkaar apni jaanch ke baad exiaar karne kii anumati nahin degi, ham isse zyada nahin bataa sakate
 That's why little is written to understand more
 agar, exiaar kii anumati nahin mili to samajhie ki us imaarat main sthit us vibhaag ke us afasar ne us maamle main 200 karod kaa ghotaalaa nahin kiya he
 Is it not possible that instead of doing so much, governments should pass a law that only Lori will be printed in the press
 tivi main ankar loriyaan sunaayenge
 The BJP has an absolute majority, the way it brought the ordinance, it can also pass it
 abhi yah hota tha ki agar police exiaar nahin kar sakati to koi court jaakar aadesh le aata tha or jaanch shuru ho jaati thi
 But if this bill is passed, then even the court will not allow it
 yah zarur he ki agar rajya sarkaar chah maheene main injazat nahin detii he to ye mana jayega ki ijazat mil gai he, yahi nahin vidheyak main yah bhi likhaa he ki sarkaar ko apane faisale ke liye koi kaaran bataane kii zarurat nahin hogi
 The name of the MP and MLA is, the Chief Minister is not, so can there be an FIR against the Chief Minister or if the Chief Minister is also an MLA or is there, then the FIR will have to be approved against him
 uttar pradesh main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko lekar aisa hi ek maamla elahabaad court main lambit he
 In this regard, we are resorting to a report in March 2017 by Scroll
in which states that the Akhilesh government did not allow the prosecution of Yogi Adityanath
 grahamantralay bhi mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke adheen he to kya ve apane kilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati denge?tippaniyan The case dates back to 2007, as an MP he is alleged to have incited violence and hatred
 gorakhpur ke patrkaar parvaiz paravaaz ne ek exiaar darj karai thi jisamen mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kaa bhi naam tha magar sarkaar ne mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati nahin di
 Since July 10, 2015, the case is awaiting permission
 saat saal main bhi antim faisla nahin hua he
 While the crime branch has completed the investigation
 court main sarkaar ke faisle kaa bachaav karte hue mukhya sachiv ne kaha tha ki parvaiz ne jo sidi jamaa karai thi usamen chhedchhad hui he
 It is not appropriate to comment more as the matter is in court
 dainik jaagran ne likhaa he ki 23 aktubar ko is maamle main sunwaayee hui
 The dock media is engaged in hymns and food, now the law will be made, then everyone will be relaxed that they will not be reported or else they will be jailed, but think from the eyes of the common man, what will happen to them if false cases are against you, Is your problem less than any MP or MLA or officer, the government has an army of lawyers to fight their case, what do you have
 karja, puja or koi nahin he duja
 What if there is no attack on the freedom of the press
 agar juthi exiaar likhaai ja rahi he to iskaa upaay yah hona chahie do chaar logon ke khilaaf exiaar likhavana mushkil kar do or baaki kaa unke haal par chhod do
 Were the 73 percent of those who faced false slander, only mlas, mps, officers, magistrates and judges? The government should have also mentioned how common people are in this 73 percent
 sarkaar ke paas yah aankada kahaan se aayaa, isaki koi jaankaree nahin di gai he
 There is no information about which agency the government will have before the FIR
 phir police ke hone kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he
 Is a separate police agency going to be formed for judges, magistrates, officers and mps? Do not forget that the government agencies also lodge false cases against citizens, in the case of terror, 20-20 years young people have been implicated in fake cases and kept in jail
 is vidheyak main is baat kaa zikr kyon nahin he
 Why hasn't the government made a provision of two years of jail against officers who have filed false cases
 jhuthe mukademe kya parshad, mukhiya, jila parishad ke sadasyon ke khilaaf nahin hote hai, unako kyon chhod diya he? According to the 2015 statistics of the National Crime Research Branch Bureau, in 2015, 40 lakh, 10 thousand, 195 cases were registered under IPC
 inamen se 1 lakh, 13 hazaar, 388 maamle jhuthe paae gaye
 Not even 3 percent of the total FIR
 rajasthan sarkaar ko 73 fisadi kahaan se aankada mila, kya rajasthan main juthi exiaar hi darj hoti hai
 By the way, the press release of the Rajasthan government has been very cleverly written
 kahin bhi saaf-saaf nahin likhaa he ki 73 fisadi juthi exiaar darj hui hai
 Let's look at the graphics one more time
 agar aap sarkaar kii baton ko ghayan se na dekhen to kab sadak ke bich main braker aa jayega pataa hi nahin chalegaa or aapkaa sar car kii chat se takaraa jayega
 The press release stated that all the cases between 2013 and 2017 have been filed in 156 (3)
 unamem se kareeb 73 pratishat mukademon main police ne effaar (final report) lagaai
 The press release did not say that the police found 73 percent of the firs in the final report to be false
 yah kaha he ki 73 fisadi maamalon main antim report pesh kar di
 During this period, about 73 per cent of the people faced false slander
 unhen doshi na hote hue bhi na keval maansik santaap jhelana padaa
 Not only 73, 100 percent people have to face mental anguish due to FIR
 is bayaan se aisa lagata he ki 27 fisadi aise bhi hai jo exiaar se khush hote hai, unhen kisi prakaar kii pareshaani nahin hoti he
 This bill is also against the media
 jab tak sarkaar exiaar kii anumati nahin degi, media apni report main us adhikari, saansad yaa vidhayak kaa naam nahin le saktaa he
 Even two years in jail if i tell your identity
 pratham soochna report main kahin nahin likhaa he ki jo likhaa gaya he vah saboot he yaa faisla he
 This only means that the police should start an investigation in this matter immediately
 editors gild ne kaha he ki pratyaksh rup se ye nyaaypalika or naukarshahi ko jhuthe exiar se bachaane ke liye laayaa gaya
 In reality, it is a deadly weapon to harass the media, hide the wrongdoings of bureaucrats and curb the freedom of the press given by the Constitution
 editors gild chahta he ki rajasthan sarkaar turant adhyadesh waapas le or ise kaanoon banane se parhez kare
 Instead of taking strict steps against fake and false cases, the Rajasthan government has brought an ordinance that wants to silence the messenger
 editors gild ne yah bhi kaha ki rajasthan sarkaar kaa ye qadam kathor he or ye janhit kii khabar dene vaale patrakaron ko giraftaar karne tak kii khuli chhot detaa he
 Parliament created a new CRPC code in 1970, stating that a person who is a judge or magistrate or public servant cannot be removed without the approval of the government if he is found to be accused of being involved in a crime
 Then the court will not take cognizance against him without sanction
 yahi nahin vidheyak laane se pehle rajasthan sarkaar ne raashtrapati se adhyadesh kaa anumodan liya he
 The ordinance has also been introduced and it has been introduced in the Legislative Assembly to make laws
 pipuls union for civil liberties ne is vidheyak ko rajasthan hycourt main chunauti dene kaa elaan kiya he
 Rajasthan's lawyer AK Jain has filed a petition in the court against this bill
 maan lijie ki yah vidheyak bagair sanshodhan ke paas ho jaataa he
 After that how would reporting a scam
 kya reporter khabar lekar 180 din baithegaa, sarkaar ke paas jayega ki aap exiaar anumati dijie to ham chhaapen
 Please, hang up for 180 days so that the scamster cleans both us and the evidence
 phir bhi reporting kaise hogi, iskaa ek namoona pesh karata hum
 It is not a sample, but the entire fabric is a police station
 reporter ko artiai se hasil jaankaree se pataa chalata he ki ek vibhaag main ek adhikari ne 200 karod kaa gaban kiya he
 Now how will he write the news because even two years jail is to be avoided
 priy darshak or priyatam pathak, aaiye aap or ham donon milakar jhil ke kinare chalate hai or apni apni kalpanaaon ke istemaal se is khabar ko samajhane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The alleged embezzlement of 200 crores of rupees is related to the MP who was sitting next to that minister who came from Delhi and was not drinking tea, that close officer of the same MP said the rules at his behest Broke and gave a contract of 200 crores to a contractor close to that MLA
 ham itnaa jaanate hai ki jahaan ghotaalaa hua he, wo vibhaag ek sarkari imaarat main he
 Which consists of a hundred rooms and in which a thousand employees sit
 inhen main se ek kamare main wo vaala afasar baithta he jisane 200 karod kaa kathith rup se ghotaalaa kiya he
 His relatives are also allegedly involved in this scam, but if we tell the name, there will be 2 years in jail
 kis shahar main, kis maamle main, kis chiz kaa ghotaalaa hua he agar ham itnaa bhi bataa denge to to pataa chal jayega ki wo vibhaag koun sa he, us vibhaag kaa sachiv koun he, us vibhaag kaa mantri koun he, or hamen do saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 If you do not know, then we are telling that the matter is of a department located in the north direction from Jaipur, the name is A, the name of the secretary is b and the name of the minister is the amount of scam
 us imaarat sthit us vibhaag ke us afasar ne us maamle main 200 karod kaa kathith rup se wo vaala ghotaalaa kiya he, jo vaala bihar main ho chukaa he
 However, in which building, in which department, in which case, in which case, in which case, that scam of 200 crores has been done, you will have to wait for 6 months to know, as long as the government will not allow the FIR to be done after its investigation , We cannot tell more than this
 isiilie thodaa likhaa he zyaada samajhnaa
 If the FIR is not approved, then understand that the officer of that department located in that building has not done a scam of 200 crores in that case
 kya aisa nahin ho saktaa ki sarkarein itnaa sab karne ke bajaae ek kanoon paas kar den ki press main sirf lori chhapegi
 Anchor lullabies will be played on TV
 bijepi ke paas sampurna bahumat he, jis tarah se vah adhyadesh le ai usee tarah se vah ise paas bhi kara sakati he
 Now it used to be that if the police could not file an FIR, then someone would go to court and get orders and the investigation would start
 magar yah vidheyak paas hua to court se bhi anumati nahin milegi
 It is sure that if the state government does not give the award in six months, then it will be considered that the permission has been granted, not only this, it is also written in the bill that the government will not have to give any reason for its decision
 saansad or vidhayak kaa naam he, mukhyamantri kaa nahin he, to kya mukhyamantri ke khilaaf epa ai aar ho sakati he yaa mukhyamantri bhi vidhayak hote hai yaa hoti hai to unke khilaaf bhi epa ai aar ke liye unheen se manzuri leni hogi
 In Uttar Pradesh, one such case is pending in the Allahabad court regarding Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 is bare main ham march 2017 kii scrol dot in kii ek report kaa sahaara le rahe hai jisamen bataaya gaya he ki akhilesh sarkaar ne yogi adityanath ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati nahin di
 If the Home Ministry is also under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, will he allow prosecution against him? The comments maamla 2007 kaa he, saansad ke taur par un par kathith rup se hinsa or nafrat bhadakaane kaa aarope he
 Gorakhpur journalist Parvez Parvaz had filed an FIR in which Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was also named but the government did not allow the prosecution
 10 july, 2015 se yah maamla anumati kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 The final decision has not been made even in seven years
 jabaki krime branch ne jaanch puri kar lee he
 Defending the government's decision in the court, the chief secretary said that the CD which Parvez had submitted was tampered with
 maamla adaalat main he isliye zyaada tippanee karnaa uchit nahin hoga
 Dainik Jagran has written that a hearing took place in the case on 23 October
 godi media vaise hi bhajan-bhojan main laga hua he ab kanoon hi ban jayega to sabko aaraam ho jayega ki report hi nahin kerani he varna jail ho jaaegi lekin aap aam aadmi kii nigaah se sochie, jhuthe mukademe aapke khilaaf honge to unka kya hoga, kya aapaki pareshaani kisi saansad yaa vidhayak yaa afasar se kam he, unka cese ladane ke liye to sarkaar ke paas vakeelon kii fouj hoti he, aapke paas kya hota he
 There is no other debt, worship and worship
 press kii azaadi par hamalaa nahin he to kya he
 If a false FIR is being written, then its solution should be to make it difficult to write an FIR against two people and leave the rest on their condition
 kya jajon, magistrate, afasaron or saansadon ke liye alag police banane ja rahi he, unke liye alag se jaanch agency hogi? mat bhuuliye ki sarkaar kii agenciyaan bhi nagarikon ke khilaaf jhuthe mukademe darj kara detii hai, aatank ke maamle main 20-20 saal noujvaan farji mukademon main fansaa kar jail main rakhe gaye hai
 Why this bill is not mentioned in this bill
 sarkaar ne jhuthe mukademe daayar karaane vaale afasaron ke khilaaf do saal kii jail kaa praavdhaan kyon nahin rakhaa he
 False cases are not against the councilor, the head, the members of the Zilla Parishad, why have they been dropped? rashtriya aparaadh shodh shakha beuro ke 2015 ke aankade ke mutabik, 2015 main ipisi ke tahat darj 40 lakh, 10 hazaar, 195 maamle darj kiye gaye
 Of these, 1 lakh, 13 thousand, 388 cases were found to be false
 kul exiaar kaa 3 pratishat bhi nahin he
 From where did the Rajasthan government get 73 percent of the data, do only false firs are registered in Rajasthan
 vaise rajasthan sarkaar kii press release main bahut chaalaaki se likhaa gaya he
 It is not clearly written anywhere that 73 per cent false firs have been filed
 ek baar or graphics par nigaah daalate hai
 If you do not look at the government's words carefully, then when the breaker will come in the middle of the road, you will not know and your head will hit the roof of the car
 press relies main kaha gaya he ki 2013 se 2017 ke bich jitne bhi mukademe 156(3) main darj hue hai
 About 73 percent of them have frs (final report) by the police
 press relies main yah nahin kaha ki police ne final report main 73 fisadi exiaar ko jhootha paaya he
 It has said that in 73 percent of the cases, a final report has been submitted
 is avadhi main kareeb 73 fisadi logon ko juthi badanaami kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Despite being guilty, he not only suffered mental anguish
 exiaar hone se 73 hi nahin 100 fisadi logon ko maansik santaap jhelana padataa he
 From this statement, it seems that there are 27 percent who are happy with the FIR, they do not have any kind of trouble
 yah vidheyak media ke kilaaf bhi he
 Unless the government allows the FIR, the media cannot name the officer, MP or MLA in its report
 pahchaan bhi bataa degaa to do saal kii jail
 Nowhere is it written in the First Information Report that what is written is evidence or verdict
 itnaa hi matlab hota he ki police is maamle main tatkaal jaanch shuru kare
 The Editors Guild states that they were brought directly to protect the judiciary and bureaucracy from false firs
 asaliyat main ye media ko tang karne, naukarshahon ke galat kaamon ko chupaane or samvidhan dwaara di gai press kii azaadi par lagaam lagane kaa ghaatak hathiyaar he
 The Editors Guild wants the Rajasthan government to immediately withdraw the ordinance and abstain from enacting it
 farzi or jhuthe muqadamon ke kilaaf sakht qadam uthaa kar sazaa dene ke bajaae rajasthan sarkaar aisa adhyadesh laai he jo sandeshvahak ko chup karana chahta he
 The Editors Guild also said that this step of the Rajasthan government is harsh and it gives an open leeway to arrest the journalists who are reporting the public interest

 editors gild ne yah bhi kaha ki rajasthan sarkaar kaa ye qadam kathor he or ye janhit kii khabar dene vaale patrakaron ko giraftaar karne tak kii khuli chhot detaa he
 Parliament created a new CRPC code in 1970, stating that a person who is a judge or magistrate or public servant cannot be removed without the approval of the government if he is found to be accused of being involved in a crime

 After that how would reporting a scam
 kya reporter khabar lekar 180 din baithegaa, sarkaar ke paas jayega ki aap exiaar anumati dijie to ham chhaapen
 Please, hang up for 180 days so that the scamster cleans both us and the evidence
 phir bhi reporting kaise hogi, iskaa ek namoona pesh karata hum
 It is not a sample, but the entire fabric is a police station
 reporter ko artiai se hasil jaankaree se pataa chalata he ki ek vibhaag main ek adhikari ne 200 karod kaa gaban kiya he
 Now how will he write the news because even two years jail is to be avoided
 priy darshak or priyatam pathak, aaiye aap or ham donon milakar jhil ke kinare chalate hai or apni apni kalpanaaon ke istemaal se is khabar ko samajhane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The alleged embezzlement of 200 crores of rupees is related to the MP who was sitting next to that minister who came from Delhi and was not drinking tea, that close officer of the same MP said the rules at his behest Broke and gave a contract of 200 crores to a contractor close to that MLA
 ham itnaa jaanate hai ki jahaan ghotaalaa hua he, wo vibhaag ek sarkari imaarat main he
 Which consists of a hundred rooms and in which a thousand employees sit
 inhen main se ek kamare main wo vaala afasar baithta he jisane 200 karod kaa kathith rup se ghotaalaa kiya he
 His relatives are also allegedly involved in this scam, but if we tell the name, there will be 2 years in jail
 kis shahar main, kis maamle main, kis chiz kaa ghotaalaa hua he agar ham itnaa bhi bataa denge to to pataa chal jayega ki wo vibhaag koun sa he, us vibhaag kaa sachiv koun he, us vibhaag kaa mantri koun he, or hamen do saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 If you do not know, then we are telling that the matter is of a department located in the north direction from Jaipur, the name is A, the name of the secretary is b and the name of the minister is the amount of scam
 us imaarat sthit us vibhaag ke us afasar ne us maamle main 200 karod kaa kathith rup se wo vaala ghotaalaa kiya he, jo vaala bihar main ho chukaa he
 However, in which building, in which department, in which case, in which case, in which case, that scam of 200 crores has been done, you will have to wait for 6 months to know, as long as the government will not allow the FIR to be done after its investigation , We cannot tell more than this
 isiilie thodaa likhaa he zyaada samajhnaa
 If the FIR is not approved, then understand that the officer of that department located in that building has not done a scam of 200 crores in that case
 kya aisa nahin ho saktaa ki sarkarein itnaa sab karne ke bajaae ek kanoon paas kar den ki press main sirf lori chhapegi
 Anchor lullabies will be played on TV
 bijepi ke paas sampurna bahumat he, jis tarah se vah adhyadesh le ai usee tarah se vah ise paas bhi kara sakati he
 Now it used to be that if the police could not file an FIR, then someone would go to court and get orders and the investigation would start
 magar yah vidheyak paas hua to court se bhi anumati nahin milegi
 It is sure that if the state government does not give the award in six months, then it will be considered that the permission has been granted, not only this, it is also written in the bill that the government will not have to give any reason for its decision
 saansad or vidhayak kaa naam he, mukhyamantri kaa nahin he, to kya mukhyamantri ke khilaaf epa ai aar ho sakati he yaa mukhyamantri bhi vidhayak hote hai yaa hoti hai to unke khilaaf bhi epa ai aar ke liye unheen se manzuri leni hogi
 In Uttar Pradesh, one such case is pending in the Allahabad court regarding Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath

 If the Home Ministry is also under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, will he allow prosecution against him? The comments maamla 2007 kaa he, saansad ke taur par un par kathith rup se hinsa or nafrat bhadakaane kaa aarope he
 Gorakhpur journalist Parvez Parvaz had filed an FIR in which Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was also named but the government did not allow the prosecution

 The press release stated that all the cases between 2013 and 2017 have been filed in 156 (3)
 unamem se kareeb 73 pratishat mukademon main police ne effaar (final report) lagaai
 The press release did not say that the police found 73 percent of the firs in the final report to be false
 yah kaha he ki 73 fisadi maamalon main antim report pesh kar di
 During this period, about 73 per cent of the people faced false slander
 unhen doshi na hote hue bhi na keval maansik santaap jhelana padaa
 Not only 73, 100 percent people have to face mental anguish due to FIR
 is bayaan se aisa lagata he ki 27 fisadi aise bhi hai jo exiaar se khush hote hai, unhen kisi prakaar kii pareshaani nahin hoti he
 This bill is also against the media
 jab tak sarkaar exiaar kii anumati nahin degi, media apni report main us adhikari, saansad yaa vidhayak kaa naam nahin le saktaa he
 Even two years in jail if i tell your identity
 pratham soochna report main kahin nahin likhaa he ki jo likhaa gaya he vah saboot he yaa faisla he
 This only means that the police should start an investigation in this matter immediately
 editors gild ne kaha he ki pratyaksh rup se ye nyaaypalika or naukarshahi ko jhuthe exiar se bachaane ke liye laayaa gaya

 In Uttar Pradesh, one such case is pending in the Allahabad court regarding Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 is bare main ham march 2017 kii scrol dot in kii ek report kaa sahaara le rahe hai jisamen bataaya gaya he ki akhilesh sarkaar ne yogi adityanath ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati nahin di
 If the Home Ministry is also under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, will he allow prosecution against him? The comments maamla 2007 kaa he, saansad ke taur par un par kathith rup se hinsa or nafrat bhadakaane kaa aarope he
 Gorakhpur journalist Parvez Parvaz had filed an FIR in which Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was also named but the government did not allow the prosecution
 10 july, 2015 se yah maamla anumati kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 The final decision has not been made even in seven years

 There is no other debt, worship and worship
 press kii azaadi par hamalaa nahin he to kya he
 If a false FIR is being written, then its solution should be to make it difficult to write an FIR against two people and leave the rest on their condition
 exiaar hone se 73 hi nahin 100 fisadi logon ko maansik santaap jhelana padataa he
 From this statement, it seems that there are 27 percent who are happy with the FIR, they do not have any kind of trouble
 yah vidheyak media ke kilaaf bhi he
 Unless the government allows the FIR, the media cannot name the officer, MP or MLA in its report
 pahchaan bhi bataa degaa to do saal kii jail
 Nowhere is it written in the First Information Report that what is written is evidence or verdict
 itnaa hi matlab hota he ki police is maamle main tatkaal jaanch shuru kare
 The Editors Guild states that they were brought directly to protect the judiciary and bureaucracy from false firs
 asaliyat main ye media ko tang karne, naukarshahon ke galat kaamon ko chupaane or samvidhan dwaara di gai press kii azaadi par lagaam lagane kaa ghaatak hathiyaar he
 The Editors Guild wants the Rajasthan government to immediately withdraw the ordinance and abstain from enacting it
 farzi or jhuthe muqadamon ke kilaaf sakht qadam uthaa kar sazaa dene ke bajaae rajasthan sarkaar aisa adhyadesh laai he jo sandeshvahak ko chup karana chahta he
 The Editors Guild also said that this step of the Rajasthan government is harsh and it gives an open leeway to arrest the journalists who are reporting the public interest
 sansad ne 1970 main nai siarpisi code banaaya tha, isamen likhaa he ki koi vyakti jo ki jaj he yaa magistrate he yaa locasevak he, jise bina sarkaar kii manzuri ke nahin hataaya ja saktaa he, agar wo kisi aparaadh main shaamil paaya jane kaa aaropee banataa he tab bina manzuri ke adaalat uske khilaaf sangyaan nahin legi
 Not only this, before the introduction of the bill, the Rajasthan government has taken approval of the ordinance from the President
 adhyadesh laayaa bhi ja chukaa he or ise kanoon banane ke liye vidhaan sabha main pesh kiya gaya he
 The People's Union for Civil Liberties has announced to challenge this bill in the Rajasthan High Court
 is bill ke khilaaf rajasthan ke vakil ek ke jain ne adaalat main yachika daayar kii he
 Suppose this bill passes without amendment
 uske baad kisi ghotaale kii reporting kaise hogi
 Will the reporter sit with the news for 180 days, go to the government that if you give FIR permission, we will print
 pleez, aap 180 din tak lataka dijie taaki ghotalebaz hamen or saboot donon ko saaf kar de
 i still offer a sample of how reporting will occur
 namoona to nahin he balki puraa kaa puraa kapade kaa thaan he
 Information obtained from RTI to the reporter reveals that an officer in a department has misappropriated 200 crores
 ab vah khabar kaise likhegaa kyonki do saal kii jail se bachanaa bhi he
 Dear audience and dear reader, let us together walk the banks of the lake and try to understand this news using our own imaginations
 200 karod ke kathith rup se hue is gaban kaa sambandh us vaale saansad se lagata he jo us rose dilli se aae us mantri ke bagal main baithe the or chaay nahin pi rahe the, usee vaale saansad ke us kareebi adhikari ne unke kehane par niyamon ko todaa or us vaale vidhayak ke kareebi thekedaar ko 200 karod kaa theka de diya
 We know enough that the department is in a government building where the scam has taken place
 jisamen sau kamare hai or jinamein ek hazaar karmchaaree baithte hai
 In one of these rooms sits the officer who allegedly scammed 200 crores
 is ghotaale main uske rishtedaar bhi kathith rup se shaamil hai magar ham naam bataa denge to 2 saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 In which city, in which case, what is the scam, if we tell this much, then it will be known who is that department, who is the secretary of that department, who is the minister of that department, and we have two years Will be jailed aapako pataa na chale isliye ham bataa rahe hai ki maamla jaipur se uttar disha main sthit ek vibhaag kaa he jiskaa naam a he, sachiv kaa naam ba he or mantri kaa naam sa he, ghotaale kii raashi da he
 That officer of that department located in that building has allegedly done a scam of 200 crores in that case, which has happened in Bihar
 phir bhi kis imaarat main sthit kis vibhaag ke kis afasar ne kis maamle main 200 karod kaa wo vaala ghotaalaa kiya he, ye jaanane ke liye aapako 6 maheene kaa intazaar karnaa hoga, kyonki jab tak sarkaar apni jaanch ke baad exiaar karne kii anumati nahin degi, ham isse zyada nahin bataa sakate
 That's why little is written to understand more
 agar, exiaar kii anumati nahin mili to samajhie ki us imaarat main sthit us vibhaag ke us afasar ne us maamle main 200 karod kaa ghotaalaa nahin kiya he
 Is it not possible that instead of doing so much, governments should pass a law that only Lori will be printed in the press
 tivi main ankar loriyaan sunaayenge
 The BJP has an absolute majority, the way it brought the ordinance, it can also pass it
 abhi yah hota tha ki agar police exiaar nahin kar sakati to koi court jaakar aadesh le aata tha or jaanch shuru ho jaati thi
 But if this bill is passed, then even the court will not allow it
 yah zarur he ki agar rajya sarkaar chah maheene main injazat nahin detii he to ye mana jayega ki ijazat mil gai he, yahi nahin vidheyak main yah bhi likhaa he ki sarkaar ko apane faisale ke liye koi kaaran bataane kii zarurat nahin hogi
 The name of the MP and MLA is, the Chief Minister is not, so can there be an FIR against the Chief Minister or if the Chief Minister is also an MLA or is there, then the FIR will have to be approved against him
 uttar pradesh main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko lekar aisa hi ek maamla elahabaad court main lambit he
 In this regard, we are resorting to a report in March 2017 by Scroll
in which states that the Akhilesh government did not allow the prosecution of Yogi Adityanath
 grahamantralay bhi mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke adheen he to kya ve apane kilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati denge?tippaniyan The case dates back to 2007, as an MP he is alleged to have incited violence and hatred
 gorakhpur ke patrkaar parvaiz paravaaz ne ek exiaar darj karai thi jisamen mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kaa bhi naam tha magar sarkaar ne mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati nahin di
 Since July 10, 2015, the case is awaiting permission
 saat saal main bhi antim faisla nahin hua he
 While the crime branch has completed the investigation
 court main sarkaar ke faisle kaa bachaav karte hue mukhya sachiv ne kaha tha ki parvaiz ne jo sidi jamaa karai thi usamen chhedchhad hui he
 It is not appropriate to comment more as the matter is in court
 dainik jaagran ne likhaa he ki 23 aktubar ko is maamle main sunwaayee hui
 The dock media is engaged in hymns and food, now the law will be made, then everyone will be relaxed that they will not be reported or else they will be jailed, but think from the eyes of the common man, what will happen to them if false cases are against you, Is your problem less than any MP or MLA or officer, the government has an army of lawyers to fight their case, what do you have
 karja, puja or koi nahin he duja
 What if there is no attack on the freedom of the press
 agar juthi exiaar likhaai ja rahi he to iskaa upaay yah hona chahie do chaar logon ke khilaaf exiaar likhavana mushkil kar do or baaki kaa unke haal par chhod do

 Posted bytejashwi yadavonsaturday, November 28, 2015 SIT filed charge sheet in Chinmayanand case mentioning allegations of ransom and sexual harassment madhyapradesh congress samiti ke sachiv suveg rathi ne purv mukhyamantri ke karyaalay se jari in anurodhon kii "pitiai-bhashaa" se brihaspativaar ko pushti kii
 Rathi, one of the supporters of Digvijay, said, "these requests have been issued in view of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi
 inkaa makasad digvijay dwaara baapu ke vichaaron kaa adhik se adhik prachaar-prasar karnaa he
 "on the other hand, BJP has targeted the Congress, calling this exercise of Digvijay" hypocrisy "
 pradesh bhaajapa pravaktaa umesh sharma ne kaha, "congress kii sarkaron ne bharat bhar main kai sadakon ke naam to mahatma gandhi ke naam par rakh die
 But after the independence of the country, Congress leaders never followed the path shown by Bapu
 " unhone kaha, "ab bhaajapa baapu kii viraasat ko desh-duniya main aage badha rahi he, to isse baukhalaaye digvijay gandhigiri ke naam par paakhand kar rahe hai
 " giriraaj singh ko jitaaiega na? pakkaa na? haath uthaa ke bataaie
 So, garland them? ”while addressing the election meeting, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar turned towards the BJP candidate from Begusarai Lok Sabha seat and welcomed him with garlands of marigold
 yah nitish kii muhar kaa sanket tha jo giriraaj ke liye bahut jaruri he
 They are caught in a triangular contest with Rashtriya Janata Dal's Tanveer Hassan and cpi's Kanhaiya Kumar here
 bhaajapa ko ummid he ki nitish kaa prachaar abhiyaan kendriya sookshm, laghu va majhole upkram rajyamantri ko atyant pichde virgon (ibisi) or daliton ke vot hasil karne main madad karegaa
 JD (U) sources say that 30 per cent of the ebcs and 15 per cent are the original vote banks of the Mahadalit Party
 in donon tabakon main milakar 150 se zyada jatiyaan hai jo bihar ke kul matadaataaon kaa 45 fisadi hissaa hai
 The top BJP leadership is said to have requested Nitish to campaign for Giriraj
 isiilie mukhyamantri 22 april or phir 27 april ko unke prachaar ke liye begusarai pahunche the
 Campaigning for Giriraj is seen as a political compulsion for Nitish for which he compromises his core values
 apni vichaardhaara or taur-tareekon, donon main hi nitish va giriraaj do alag-alag dhruv hai
 Nitish has been advocating social harmony and secularism, while Giriraj has been known for his staunch Hindutva views
 darasal, unke prachaar main nitish ke jane ke ek din baad 23 april ko giriraaj ne yah kahkar phir se vivaad khadaa kar diya ki chunaav ayog ko musalmaan sanghathanon ke hare jhande ke istemaal par pabandi laga deni chahie
 a senior JD (U) leader said, "the Chief Minister has taken additional steps on his behalf
" unhone endie kii sau se zyada chunavi sabhaaon ko sambodhit kiya he, pradhanmantri kii sabhi paanch reliyon main shirkat kii he or narendra modi ke namakan bharne ke dauraan nitish varanasi main maujuud rahe
 The BJP has given 17 Lok Sabha seats to the party which had only two mps
 bhaajapa ne nitish kii ichha ko jagah dene ke liye apane paanch maujuuda saansadon ke tikat kaat die or bhagalpur kii paaramparik seat bhi chhod di
 Obviously, the Chief Minister also had to repay this favor
 ''haalanki jad (you) netaaon ke ek varg ko yah ashanka he ki yah party kii dharmanirepaksh chhavi ke khilaaf ja saktaa he
 One tragedy of the alliance with the BJP has been that even after the completion of four phases of voting, the JD (U) 's election manifesto has not been released yet
 darasal, ghoshnaptr ke masaude main samaan aachaar samhita lagu karne or anuchhed 370 ko hataae jane ke khilaaf party kaa spasht rukh bhi shaamil tha, jo bhaajapa ke in muddon par vichaaron ke ulat he
 "getting votes is more important than secularism," says a JD (U) leader
 ''endie ke hisse ke taur par bihar main jad (you) or bhaajapa 17-17 siton par chunaav lard rahi hai jabaki ram vilaas paswan kii lok janashakti party chah siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 JD (U) is contesting elections in alliance with BJP after a decade

 1
 waapas flert na karen
 
 
 Yes, you have to be very serious about your gesture
 aisa kai baar hota he ki aapke hans-hans kar baat karne ko saamne or hi maan letaa he
 In this case, make the proper distance from it at the right time
 2
 Avoid being together
 
 
 vah banda / bandi mausam kii aad main hameshaa baatcheet shuruyaat karne kii koshish karegaa / karegi
 No matter how hot it is, is it because of you? to aap kahen ki apni tabiyat kaa khyal rakhen or airkandishnar kaa states check kar len
 3
 body language par najar rakhen
 
 
 Your body language should never make the next person feel that you are very interested in what he says
 use ehsaas dilaaein ki aap usase duurari banaae rakhana chaahate hai
 Turning your hands face to face, looking at it with sharp eyes will be enough to keep it away
 4
 Talk to his friend
 
 
 kisi bhi tarah kii paristhiti main funsane se pehle jaruri he ki aapvaisi paristhitiyambanane hi na den
 If you know a friend of that person who is flirting, then great, otherwise, someone who can convey your message to him that he does not like you
 5
 Show him his rightful place
 
 
 kisi ko bhi bina vajah spes dene se baat bighad sakati he
 If its flirting is crossing its limit, then you come out of there
 aapkaa ek majboot ishaara hi use khud par control rakhane ke liye kaaphi hoga
 6
 kisi bhi tarah ke sajestive mail par riplai na karen
 
 
 It happens many times that the next one will mail you, send such messages as if it spills life on you
 wo aapkophacebuk, whatsapeper bhi approach karne kii koshish karegaa / karegi

 com Mahendra Singh Dhoni set a new Indian record of highest individual score as a captain in India's first innings against Australia by scoring 224 runs in Chennai on Monday
 isse pehle yah record sachin tendulkar ke naam par darj tha
 Dhoni today extended his innings by 206 runs and soon he was able to break the record of Tendulkar who scored 217 against New Zealand in 1999 in Ahmedabad
 bharat ke keval chaar khilaadi hi ab tak captain rahete hue doharaa shatak jamaa paae hai
 First this feat was done by Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi against England in 1964 in New Delhi
 unhone tab naabad 203 ran banaae the
 After this, Sunil Gavaskar played a 205-run captaincy innings against West Indies in Mumbai in 1978
 dhoni kii tarah pataudi or tendulkar ne bhi apana pehla doharaa shatak captain ke rup main lagaaya tha
 The match was drawn when Pataudi, Gavaskar and Tendulkar scored double centuries as captain
 tippaniyan Dhoni, however, could not break the record for the highest score as a wicketkeeper batsman
 yah ricard zimbabwe ke endi flower ke naam par he jinhone 2000 main bharat ke khilaaf nagpur main naabad 232 ran banaae the
 He is followed by Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara (230 runs) and then Dhoni
 dhoni ne spinner nathan leone ko vishesh rup se nishane par rakhaa or unki 83 gendon par 104 ran batore jisamen nau chauke or paanch chakke shaamil hai
 Only four players of India have been able to score a double century while still captain
 sabase pehle yah karnama mansoor ali khan pataudi ne 1964 main england ke khilaaf nai dilli main kiya tha
 He had scored 203 not out then

 i will not let the Biharites live again cheat me again
 main kaid main hum mere vichaar vahiin
 i am sharing my thoughts with you, because only by sharing ideas with each other, we can fight these dividing forces
 unhone aage likhaa, 'is baar chunaav main sabakuch daanv par he
 This time the election is not the same as before
 desh, samaaj, lalu yani aapkaa barabari se sir uthaakar chalane kaa jajba dene vaala or aapke haq or izzat or garima sab daanv par he
 The fight is through
 mere gale main sarkaar or chalbaajon kaa fanda fansaa hua he
 The body is not supporting with age, but Lalu's challenge will always be in the battle of Aan and Abaru
 lalu prasad yadav ke liye supreme court kaa yah faisla isliye bhi sabase bada jhatka he, kyonki 1977 ke baad aisa pehali baar hoga ki lalu prasad yadav kisi bhi chunaav prachaar main shaamil nahin honge
 Let me tell you that Lalu Prasad campaigned for his party in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and Bihar assembly elections in 2015, however, at that time he came out of jail on bail
 supreme court ke jajment ke baad kai chijen nai hongi
 For example, after 1977 when Lalu Prasad Yadav contested for the first time and was elected as an MP from Saran, he would not be able to campaign
 chaara ghotaalaa main fanse hone kii vajah se unhen ayogy tehra diya gaya tha, jisaki vajah se vah chunaav nahin lard sake the, magar vah 2014 ke chunaav or 15 ke vidhansabha chunaav main apni party ke prachaar prasar main shaamil hue the
 Not only this, until Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was found guilty in a special CBI court in the fodder scam case, is difficult to get out of jail, till Lalu Prasad Yadav is convicted
 bataa den ki lalu prasad ko nau sau karod rupee se adhik ke chaara ghotaale se sambandhit teen maamalon main doshi tehraaya ja chukaa he
 These cases relate to the fraudulent withdrawal of money from the treasury department of Animal Husbandry in the 1990s, when Jharkhand was part of Bihar
 lalu prasad ne ucch nyaayalay main jamaanat ke liye apni umr or girte swasthya kaa hawala dete huye kaha tha ki vah madhumeh, raktchaap or kai anya bimariyon se jujh rahe hai or unhen chaara ghotaale se sambandhit ek maamle main pehle hi jamaanat mil gayi thi
 The RJD supremo has been convicted in the crime of extorting money from two treasuries in Deoghar, Dumka and Chaibasa in Jharkhand
 is samay un par doranda koshagaar se dhan nikaale jane se sambandhit maamle main mukadmaa chal rahaa he
 The BJP has expressed satisfaction over the report of the Special Investigation Team (SIT)
 esaiti ne kathith rup se kaha gaya he kigujarat dangonko lekar vahaan kemukhyamantri narendra modike khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane laayak koi subut nahin mili hai
 BJP said, this has proved that fabricated evidence is not true
 bijepi ke mukhya pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne yahaan kaha, ‘media kii khabaron ke anusaar esaiti ne metropolitan magistrate kii adaalat ko pesh apni report main kaha he ki gujarat dangon ko lekar vahaan ke mukhyamantri ke viruddh koi subut nahin mili hai
 He said that the SIT was formed on the direction of the Supreme Court on the complaint of Zakia Jafri, wife of former Congress MP Ahsan Jafri who was killed in the riots in Gulberg Society massacre
 lekin media khabaron ke anusaar esaiti ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke khilaaf dangon ke sambandh main mukaddama chalaane laayak koi subut nahin paaya he
 Prasad said, 'if this report of the media is correct then we are very satisfied
 modi ko fansaane ke liye pichley das saal se rashtriya or antarrashtriya str par congress or kuch sanghathanon dwaara kuprachaar chalaaya ja rahaa tha
 But it has now been proved that fabricated evidence is not true
 ’ dangon ko durbhagyapurna bataate hue unhone kaha ki doshiyon ko sazaa milani chahie, lekin dangon ko narendra modi ke khilaaf kuprachaar kaa hathiyaar bananaa sarvatha anuchit he
 On the question whether Modi has joined the prime ministerial candidates from BJP after the SIT report, he said that there is no doubt that Modi is a senior BJP leader and both at the state and national level He will play an important role
 udhar loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne modi ko mili is kathith clin chit par raahat jataate hue kaha ki kam se kam ab gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke khilaaf barason se chalaaya ja rahaa kuprachaar samaapt ho janaa chahie
 Sushma said on Twitter, 'the SIT constituted by the Supreme Court says that there is no evidence against Narendra Modi
 hamaare liye yah badi raahat kii baat he

 India have world-class fast bowlers like Bumrah, Shami, Umesh and Ishant
 These bowlers can test the opposition batting order under any circumstances
 Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner, Colin
 Croft and Malcolm Marshall's name comes in Jehan
 aise main jabaki carabian cricket avsaan par he, to lagata he ki bhartiya pesaron ne uske tej gendbaajon ke saare gunon ko aatmsaat kar liya he or yahi kaaran he ki aaj ve duniya bhar main 'awwal' banakar ubhar chuke hai
 There was a time when India had Kapil Dev, but he was alone
 iske baad javagal shrinath, venkatesh prasad, jahir khan or ashish nehra or irfan pathan aae lekin ye yaa to akele khele yaa phir dukke hi khel sake
 Today the situation is that India has five or so say that there are six such fast bowlers, who can blow the batting order of any team under any circumstances
 bharat ke paas vishwastareey tej gendbajjasprit bumraah, mohammad shami, umesh yadav, eshanth sharma, bhubaneshwar kumaar or hardik pandya ke rup main bharat ke paas vishwastareey tej gendbaaj hai or sabase ahm baat yah he ki ye sabhi team ko ek saath sevaayen de rahe hai
 Never before in the history of such Indian cricket
 2019 khatm hone ko he or is saal har kisi kii jubaan par bhartiya tej gendbaajon kaa hi naam he
 The reason for this is the performance of Indian fast bowlers this year, which is historical in many ways
 bharat ke maujuuda akraman ko dekhakar sabhi ne mana he ki bharat ke paas is samay ke sabase khatarnaak or kaabil tej gendbaaj hai
 This is also proved by statistics
 2019 main bhartiya gendbaajon kaa test ausat mahaj 15
 It has been 16, which is the second best bowling attack in a calendar year in terms of performance so far, taking more than 50 wickets in a calendar year
 yahi nahin, yah is saal kisi bhi tej gendbaaji akraman kaa sabase acha ausat bhi he
 Australia 22
 49 ke saath duusare sthaan par he
 Also, this is the best collective bowling average of a team's bowling attack in a single calendar year in the last 67 years
 fast bowling atake sarvshereshthawahin, bhartiya akraman kaa is saal kaa strike rate 31
 06, which is the best strike rate for a team's fast bowling attack in Test history
 is maamle main australia duusare sthaan par he
 46 of Australian bowlers this year
 6 strike rate rahaa he
 During this time, these Indian bowlers have taken a total of 116 wickets
 bharat hameshaa spinneron ke liye vikhyath rahaa
 Talking legacy of BS Chandrasekhar, Bishan Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna, Venkata Raghavan was handled by Maninder Singh, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh
 kabhi bhi bhartiya tej gendbaaj charchaa main nahin rahe, lekin ab tahalaka tej gendbaaj machaa rahe hai
 Talking about the personal performances of Bumrah, Ishant, Umesh, Shami, Bhubaneswar, Ishant has played a total of six Test matches this year
 in chah maichon main lambii kad lathi ke is gendbaaj ne 34 wicket apane naam kiye hai
 During this time he averaged 15
 56 or strike rate 32
 Stayed 5
 vahiin, umesh ne is saal chaar test match khele or 14 wicket apane naam kiye
 Umesh was out of the Test team this year but Bhuvneshwar Kumar's injury brought him back in the South Africa series
 umesh kaa is saal kaa ausat 13
 65, while the strike rate is 23
 1 he
 Shami, who danced the batsmen on the swing, is not far behind, who danced the batsmen on the basis of his swing
 is saal pashchim bengal ke is gendbaaj ne aath test match khele hai or 49 wicket apane naam kiye hai
 Shami averaged 16 during this period
 66 or strike rate 23
 1 remained
 shami ke pradarshan main khaas baat yah rahi ki vah duusari pari main bharat ke liye behad kifayati rahe hai
 Bumrah, who was out of the South Africa and Bangladesh series due to injury, has played only three Test matches this year and the right-arm bowler has taken 19 wickets in these matches
 bumraah kaa ausat apane saathiyon se kam rahaa he
 Bumrah averaged 13 this year
 14 rahaa he jabaki strike rate 30
 09
 yah aakande bataate hai ki spin ke dabadabe vaali bhartiya team ke paas ab aise tej gendbaaj bhi hai jo har jagah wicket nikaal sakate hai
 Their dominance has been such that veteran spinners like Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin could not take wickets in the day-night Test match played at the Eden Gardens Stadium against Bangladesh and the entire team took 20 wickets
 yah pehla saal nahin he jab bhartiya gendbaajon ne damdaar pradarshan kiya he
 In the year 2018, India played almost all its Tests on foreign soil
 bhartiya gendbaajon ne in kul 11 test maichon main 158 wicket apane naam kiye the
 This was the second best performance by a fast bowling attack in a year in terms of wickets
 windies jaisaa bowling ataikaek saal main sabase zyada wicket lene vaala fast bowling atake windies kaa hi rahaa jisamen garnor, croft, holding
 There were bowlers like Marshall, Robtars and Sylvester Clarke
 is akraman ne 1980 main kul 189 wicket liye the
 Last year, India played almost all the Tests outside here, while this year it has played most of its Tests in India
 videshi jameen par bhi bhartiya tej gendbaaj acha karte hai
 It is noteworthy that Ishant, Shami, Bhuvneshwar and Bumrah have taken most wickets in their careers in Overseas
 iskaa kaaran viketon or paristhatiyon se milane vaali madad hota he, lekin spinneron kaa adda maani jane vaali bhartiya jameen par bhi tej gendbaaj agar haaavee rahete hai to yah bataata he ki tej gendbaaji akraman kaa painaa pen kis tarah kaa he or yah nishchit taur par bhartiya cricket ke liye nae yug kii shuruyaat he

 san 1971 ke baad yah pehali baar hua jab bhartiya vayusena ne niyantran rekha (elosi) ko cross karke paak par hamalaa kiya
 The Air Force destroyed the terrorist stronghold Balakot in just one and a half minutes
 is hamale main kareeb 300 aatanki maare gaye
 India was attacked by Afghans and Mughals a few centuries ago
 in hamalon ke dauraan in donon hamalaavaron ne apana base balakot ko banaaya tha
 Now India attacked this place and destroyed the terrorist camps present there
 vayusena ne pakki khufia jaankaree ke aadhaar par hi yah karrwai kii
 Sources said that in the Balakot area there is a forest in the middle and there are mountains of stones standing all around
 yah khaybar pakhtoon kaa ilaaka he
 This place has an air-line of about 60 km from loc
 hamale main 250 se 300 aatankiyon ke maare jane kii sambhaavna he
 According to sources, terrorists in Pakistan had come back from the launching pad after the Pulwama attack
 balakot main jaish kaa mukhya training centre tha jisamen 6 baiyrakon main aatanki rahe rahe the
 There were three types of courses Basic, Advance and Bat
 har course kareeb teen maheene kaa hota tha
 Masood Azhar's son was trained here
 160 bat commando kii training july 2017 main yaheen hui thi
 Masood Azhar's brother-in-law Yusuf Azhar was the head of this camp
 pulavama hamale kaa mastermind abdul rashid gaji kii training yaheen hui thi
 The attack time of the Indian Air Force Mirage at Balakot was just one and a half minutes
 yah puri karrwai 20 minute main puri ho gai
 This time includes the movement of fighter jets
 hamalaa lager gided bam se kiya gaya
 All the targets were perfectly accurate
 dilli kii sieji report main rashan ko lekar badi gadabadi kaa khulaasa hua he
 The Aam Aadmi Party government is surrounded by questions as soon as the report comes out
 vahiin is par dipti siem manish sisodiya kaa bayaan aayaa he
 Manish Sisodia said that we have not been accused but i am making allegations
 sisodiya ne daawa kiya ki jo bhi doshi ho nahin chodenge, chaahe mantri ho yaa apradhi yaa alji
 Manish Sisodia said that everything is clearly written in this report
 yah sirf 3 saalon kaa maamla nahin he, balki isamen pichley 8-10 saalon kaa kaccha chittha he
 In this report, records of up to 25 years have come out
 manish sisodiya ne aarope lagaaya ki ham pichley 3 saal se kah rahe hai ki rashan vibhaag membhrashtacharhai
 About a year and a half ago, we planned that there is corruption in the ration and told the Lieutenant Governor that we are bringing a new scheme with door step delivery
 uparajyapal ne kaha ki unki afasaron se baatcheet ho gai he or afasaron ne unhen bataaya he ki sab kuch thik he
 The officers have written on file that everything is going well, so that plan is not needed
 sisodiya ke anusaar ab sieji report bataa rahi he kiraashan vyavastha main chori ho rahi he
 Let us change the system, the theft which we have been telling for 3 years that it is being stolen
 ham kehete hai ki afasar hataao, LG afasar nahin hataate
 We say suspend these, LG does not suspend
 ham kehete hai is vyavastha ko badalane do LG vyavastha nahin badalane dete
 'scam happened' Manish Sisodia said that the CAG report says that the system is being stolen to such an extent that the number of trucks used to take it from the warehouse to the ration shop were either scooters or motorcycles
 Or was Three Wheeler's number
 jo rashan trakon par ladakar aata he, sieji report kahati he ki vah scooter yaa motor cycle par ladakar aayaa he
 This means that the scam is happening and the bottom is getting messed up
 jab ham kah rahe hai ki neeche gadabad ho rahi he to uparajyapal ek bhi afasar par karrwai nahin karte, uskaa transfar tak nahin karte, us ko sho coj notice tak nahin dete
 According to Manish Sisodia, why are the Lt Governor protecting these officers to suppress scams? The leadership and the elected government are taking up these scams
 mantri kahata he ki inspection karke aao, adhikari inspection karne nahin jaataa or uparajyapal se uskaa transfar nahin karte
 The leadership, the minister and the deputy chief minister, who were screaming and screaming, have been exposed to the same thing by the CAG
 'isliye laa rahe the door step delivery'rashan kii door step delivery isiilie laai gai thi kyonki usase hi samaadhaan nikalataa
 Imran Hussain took action, but no further action was taken
 jab se hai court kaa aadesh aayaa he tab se ek afasar ko transfar karne kii file par bhi mantri se charchaa nahin karte
 The will of the Lt
 Governor or the will of the Secretary is carried out
 'maine khud kii he shikaayat'sisodiya ne kaha ki main khud uparajyapal ko bataa chukaa hum ki nijee skool ke paksh main ek adhikari ne affidavit tak file kiya he
 i said remove the officer and get the CBI investigated
 uparajyapal ne uskaa jawaab tak nahin diya
 'not just a matter of our government', it is not just a matter of our government

 'is it necessary to treat the Congress party like a train whose coaches will be pulled from the engine of nehru-gandhi dynasty or is there no other option? Seeing Rao's way of expressing anger, i was a bit cheated
 raav ko laga ki unhone bahut kam vakt main bahut zyada kah diya or nehru khandaan ke virodh kii apni bhaavana ko jaldbaaji main ujagar kar diya
 He asked carefully, - There will be no harm from this suggestion, but will she accept it

 It is certain that Arjun Singh's book has sparked a new debate on many incidents
 arjuna singh kii kitaab babari masjid kii ghatana kaa zikr he
 During this, he accused Narasimha Rao of playing a role like Nero
 ayodhya kii halchal par pradhanmantri narsimha raav kii bhoomika kaa bhi arjuna singh kii kitaab main vistaar se zikr he
 Prime Minister Narasimha Rao was trying to please everyone on the Ayodhya incident
 ek maukey par to unhone aresas pramukh se khud jaakar milane kaa faisla kar daalaa
 i objected to this proposed move and said that this would bring great disrepute to the government

 i was told that he could not talk to anyone
 unhone khud ko ek kamare main band kar liya he or hamen nirdesh die gaye hai ki unhen kisi bhi sthiti main disturb nahin kiya jaae

 Arjun Singh was confident that his loyalty to the Gandhi family would bring color at some time, but in 2009, Arjun Singh's name was missing from the cabinet list
 arjuna singh ne likhaa he ki isse unhe bheetar tak chot lagi thi
 Of course it was difficult for Arjun Singh to believe that his innings was over now

 Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah said about the upcoming assembly elections in Karnataka that the BJP is going to win the Karnataka elections
 saath hi unhone congress par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki 'jis tarah siddharmaiya (karnataka ke mukhyamantri) rajya ko chalaa rahe hai, usamen nishchit taur par sarkaar virdohi lahar kaam karegi
 Apart from this, the immense popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also a factor
 'ajtak ke flagship sho 'sidhi baat' main hi unhone lingayat se jude mudde par kaha, 'karnataka ke log or lingayat samudaay acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki congress ne 2013 main is samudaay ko alag dharm kaa darja dene ke prastaav ko khaarij kar diya tha
 The Congress is airing this issue because it knows that it cannot contest elections in the name of development
 ' vahiin shah ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii ore se votaron ko lubhaane ke liye mandir, carch or masjidon main jane ko tavajjo nahin dete hue kaha ki wo gujarat or himachal main bhi mandiron main gaye the
 But what happened? Amit Shah himself said: This is not shah-modi's time, it is only Modi's time, read 10 big statements 'NDA will not break' Regarding fighting, he said that in 2014 many new parties joined hands with us
 11 partiyaan hamase judi thim or inamen se sirf ek alag hui he
 NDA will not break
 'upachunaav main sapa or basapa kaa gathjod jimmedaar'uttar pradesh upachunaav main mili karaari haar ke liye shah ne sapa or basapa ke bich ain maukey par bane gathjod ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 He also said that the party has formed a committee to review the reasons for the defeat and the party is ready to fight for a 50 percent vote share in 2019
 upachunaav kii tarj par saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main dhur virodhiyon sapa or basapa ke gathjod kii sambhaavna se bijepi kaa chunavi ganit gadabadane sambandhi sawaal par shah ne kaha ki ye saral nahin he
 Amit Shah said in 'sidhi Baat', We will answer every bullet of Pakistan with the maximum number of seats in 2019 '
 congress kii ore se sansad parisar main mithai banti gai ki hamane upachunaav main aath siten khoi hai lekin ye koi nahin kah rahaa ki hamane unase 11 pradesh chhine hai
 No one is taking the name of Tripura, where we won a huge victory two weeks ago
 shah ne ye bhi kaha ki hamane haar ke kaarnon kii jaanch ke liye cameti banaai he or uski jo report aegi us par kaam kiya jayega
 We have to keep in mind that by-elections are fought keeping local issues in mind, every local election has a different scenario, but the general election involves big leaders and big issues
 saal 2019 main bijepi or rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan adhik siten hasil karengi
 The victory that Congress has not won for 50 years, we will get in 2019: In a straightforward matter, Amit Shah's answer to 'bharat Bam Se Bada' said that after 1967, Congress has never been able to get more than 50 per cent votes
 hamane 50 fisadi vot gujarat, himachal or tripura main hasil kiye
 In a multi-party democratic system, winning more than 50 percent of the vote is a big mandate
 vahiin pakistan ko lekar unhone kaha ki pakistan kii har goli kaa bharat bam se jawaab degaa
 This is the only solution
 ham goli or bamon ke bich shanti vaarta nahin kar sakate
 (see full video) haalanki kehete sabhi yahi hai ki paisa khushi nahin de saktaa
 But sometimes happiness can be bought by it
 agar aapako hamaari baat par yakeen nahin he to jaane ye tareeke or badalen apana najariya-1) anubhav khariden, saamaan nahinvisheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki saamaan kharidne kii tulana main chuttee yaa adventuras khel ke anubhavon par paisa kharch karne se khushi lambey samay tak rahati he
 The reason for this is that your experiences stay in your mind as memories and whenever you think about them, the mood is completely refreshed
 2) apana paisa dusron par kharch karenek research kii maane to khud par paise kharch kii tulana main anya logon, aamtaur par doston yaa parivaar par paisa kharch karne par aapako zyada khushi milti he
 So to be happy, start connecting others' happiness with yourself
 iske alaava, charity karnaa yaa jaruratmandon kii madad karnaa bhi khushi paane kaa ek behatar tarika he
 3) Find happiness in small things: Relaxation will be felt by you for an ice cream bar or even after taking a head massage in the salon, you will also get pleasure from it
 jaruri nahin he ki khushi paane ke liye aap kuch bada hone kaa intjaar karen
 This can also be done on small successes or occasions
 4) fursat kaa samay kharidenkoshish karen ki aap apane liye samay khariden or usfursat ke samay ko un chizon main lagaaenjo karnaa aapako pasand he
 For example, if you do not like to cook, then you can keep a cook and you can spend the time left in the works that give you pleasure
 5) shauk par kharch karengar aap kisi sports club kii membership par kharch karen yaa aisi koi class se juden jisamen aapaki gahari dilchaspee ho to khushiyaan aapse dur nahin rahengi
 The happiness you get when you do your favorite work, your happiness stays with you for a long time and does not let you break down in small situations

 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal ne kaha he ki gandhivadi anna hazaare paksh ke janalokapal vidheyak ko agar sweekaar kiya jaataa he to isse nyaaypalika or karypalika ‘lakwagrast’ ho jaayegi
 Sibal, a member of the joint committee set up to draft the Lokpal Bill, in his latest article 'jan Lokpal - Sickness Cures From Disease' (part-2), the conduct of the Prime Minister's post, the judiciary and the mps are under the Lokpal's purview There is strong opposition to the proposals for bringing
 sibbal ne kaha, ‘pradhanmantri karyaalay hamaare sansadeey loktantr kaa pramukh centre he
 An independent but autocratic Janlokpal can destabilize the entire system badly
 aisa lokapal pradhanmantri ke khilaaf jaanch sirf yah pataa lagane ke liye kar saktaa he ki kya un par lage aarope niraadhaar hai
 This will hurt parliamentary democracy
 ’ unhone kaha ki maujuuda vyavastha ke tahat pradhanmantri ko abhiyojan se chhot praapt nahin he
 In a case if the facts are in the public domain, then the system cannot allow any corrupt person to continue in the Prime Minister's post
 patr soochna karyaalay ke jariye jari apane lekh kii duusari kadi main sibbal ne kaha ki asthir pados or aatankwaad ke vaastavik khatre ke bich pradhanmantri kii sanstha ko kamazor karnaa aitihaasik bhul hogi
 Sibal said in his article, 'another reason for concern about the Jan Lokpal Bill is related to the attempt to bring mps under the purview of prosecution
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 105 (2) ke tahat sadan ke andar apni baat rakhane or vot daalane ke sansad sadasyon ke adhikaar ko sangrakshan mila hua he
 These two rights are valuable
 ’ kendriya mantri ne kaha ki sansad sadasyon ke in adhikaron ke prayog ko abhiyojan ke daayre main laane se saansadon kii kahi har baat or unke daale gayi har vot par sawaal uthne lagenge
 Constitutional amendment will be required to give such authority to Lokpal
 sibbal ne kaha ki is masale kaa hal sansad kii aachaar samiti ke paas he jo kisi bhi sadsy ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kaa pratham drushtya saboot milane par kaarywahi kar sakati he or loksabhaa adhyaksh se abhiyojan kii manjuuri le sakati he
 On the issue of judiciary, Sibal said in his article that the autonomy and independence of the judiciary has been protected through the Constitution
 ucch nyaaypalika kaa koi bhi nyaayadhish keval mahabhiyog kii prakriya ke jariye hi hataaya ja saktaa he
 He said that an alternative mechanism has been talked about under the Jan Lokpal Bill

 The first Lok Sabha session of 0 has started
 aaj bajet satr shuru ho gaya he or nae saansadon ko shapath dilaai jaaegi
 Earlier, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the media, he instructed the opposition in gestures
 PM ne kaha ki vipaksh numbergem kii chintaa chode or lok kalyaan ke muddon ko uthaae
 With this statement of the Prime Minister, there is now a speculation that whether the Modi government will show the heart to the opposition party Congress will give the post of Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha? Tell that no party could get the post of Leader of Opposition in the last Lok Sabha also
 or is baar bhi number game yahi bataa rahaa he
 The Congress is currently the largest party in the opposition and has a total of 52 mps
 jabaki netaa vipaksh ke pad ke liye sadan ke 10 fisadi sankhya jaruri hoti he, is lihaaj se netaa vipaksh ke pad ke liye 55 siten jaruri hoti hai
 However, after the election results, there was a statement from the Congress party that they do not have the Leader of Opposition number, so they will not even demand this post
 'congress ko hi ye pad dena chahenge modi'varisht patrkaar urmilesh ne bhi is mudde par kaha ki vipaksh main aisi koi party nahin he jiske paas itane number ho ki use vipaksh ke netaa kaa pad mil sake
 During the discussion on our news channel Aaj Tak, he said that the leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party will be the leader of the opposition
 urmilesh bole ki sattadhari dal chahega ki vipaksh ke netaa kaa pad chahenge ki congress ko hi mili, kyonki itane prachand bahumat ke saath bada dil dikhaanaa acha sandesh bhi degaa
 Significantly, in the last term, Mallikarjun Kharge was the leader of the Congress House which used to be in the role of 'leader of Opposition' being the largest party of the opposition
 haalanki, modi sarkaar ne aadhikarik taur par unhen ye pad nahin diya tha jiske liye vah paanch saal ladate bhi rahe
 Now on one side, discussions are being intensified on the Leader of the Opposition, while on the other hand there is still waiting for who will be the Leader of the Congress
 pichhali baar mallikarjun khadge ke paas ye pad tha, lekin ab vah khud hi chunaav haar gaye hai
 In such a situation, there is a question on who will handle this post from the Congress, whether Rahul Gandhi himself will take up this position, its speculation is also fast
 bataa den ki sadan kii kaarywahi shuru hone se pehle piem ne media ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki pratipaksh ke log number kii chintaa chhod den, hamaare liye unki bhaavana moolyawaan he
 In Parliament, we should act like a fair except opposition and opposition

 punjab sarkaar ke cabinet mantri trupt rajinder singh bajva or sukhjinder randhaava ne aadharshila ke kaarykram ko centre sarkaar kaa jaldbaaji main liya gaya faisla qaraar diya he
 The central government took a hasty decision
 He said that Pakistan has decided to lay the foundation stone on 28 November
 isi vajah se aanan-fanan main centre sarkaar ne 26 november ko hipunjab sarkaarko aadharshila kaa kaarykram yojit karne kaa nirdesh de diya
 Whereas the National Highway Authority of India, which is to build this corridor, does not yet know from where this corridor will be taken out and where the foundation stone of this corridor will be laid
 punjab sarkaar ko nahin kaarykram kii puri jaankarifilhal deraa baba nanak main jahaan doorabeen lagi he, vahaan se kareeb 2-3 kilometre dur gaanv maan main sarkari kaarykram yojit karne kii taiyaariyaan chal rahi hai
 According to the ministers of the Punjab government, the foundation stone will also be placed here
 punjab ke cabinet ministar trupt rajinder singh bajva ke anusaar ab tak punjab sarkaar ko ye bhi nahin bataaya gaya ki manch par kin-kin viviipi logon ko bithaaya jayega or manch se koun-koun bolegaa
 According to Trupt Rajinder Singh Bajwa, the local MLA and MP will also have to sit on the stage
 iske alaava punjab sarkaar ke mukhyamantri or mantri bhi manch par baithenge
 There is also talk of Nitin Gadkari's arrival in this program, in such a situation, who will sit on the dais with the Vice President and who will address from the stage is not clear yet

 According to Trupt Rajinder Singh Bajwa, the Sikh Sant Samaj is angry at the name of the Badal family in the report of the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission, which investigated the cases of Gurugranth Sahib's disharmony
 NHAI ne sadhi chuppipunjab ke deraa baba nanak menkartarpur coridorake shilanyas ke kaarykram ko jaldbaaji or shilanyas kii jagah tak punjab sarkaar ke mantriyon ke sawaal par neshnal haive athurity of india yani NHAI ne puri tarah se chuppi saadh lee he
 NHAI Chief Satish Ranjan remained completely silent on the questions asked about the foundation stone
 unhone ye bhi nahin bataaya ki aakhirkaar ye aadharshila kaa pathar bharat-paak seemaa ke kareeb kahaan rakhaa jayega
 Will Sukhbir Singh Badal sit on the dais? On the other hand, the controversy is also about sharing the stage of the government program of Akali Dal President and former Punjab Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal
 punjab sarkaar ke mantriyon ke mutabik pehle do manch lagaae jane kii taiyaari ho rahi thi kyonki congress ke netaa or sarkaar ke mantri sukhbir badal or harsimrat cor badal ke saath manch saajha karnaa nahin chaahate hai
 But later, after the intervention of Captain Amarinder Singh, now a single platform is being prepared
 kya sukhbir badal is manch par baithenge? isko lekar ab punjab sarkaar ke mantriyon kaa kahana he ki ye captain amarinder singh ko tay karnaa he lekin agar sukhbir badal, harsimrat cor badal manch par rahe to aise main sikh samaaj ke log kaarykram kaa bycott kar sakate hai or kaarykram main kuch bhi galat ho saktaa he
 After a quarrel during a picnic, a student arrived at school with a pistol with two friends to teach a lesson to his classmate
 haalanki pistaul dekhakar anya chaatro ne skool prabandhak ko jaankaree di or police ko bulaayaa gaya
 Vikaspuri police station reached the spot, caught three people with pistols, including a minor student
 philhal police ne sambandhit dhaaraon main cese darj kar do aropiyon ko jail or naaballig ko bal sudhaar grih bhej diya he
 Police are currently investigating where the student brought the pistol and with whose help

 He arrived on leave and started threatening other students

 If the investigation reveals that the student's father was aware of the carrying of the pistol, then action will also be taken against him
