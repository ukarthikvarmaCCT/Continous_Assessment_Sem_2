 Although it is currently on zero stage

 Ayushmann's wife Tahira has given this information on her Instagram page
 tahiraa ne likhaa, "mujhe rhite breast main DCIS (dactal corkinoma in citu) hua he
 Now i have become a half Indian version of Angelina Jolie
 maine apane doctor ko kaha ki ab kardashiyaan ko compitishan dene kaa samay aa gaya he
 But nobody heard me
 isane mujhe jindagi kii ek nai paribhaasha di he
 "view this post on Instagram An opportunity to give competition to the Kardashians just went wasted! a week back i mentioned about 'my badge of honor' that i was going to receive
" And i did and am happy to share about it with the intention of it being received with love
 As that's the only reason i am posting it
 Love for self and gratitude for the universe
 The picture might be disturbing for some, but these drains have become my dumbells for a few days
 i was detected with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) in my right breast with high grade malignant cells
 Simply put stage 0 cancer / pre-cancerous stage, with cancer cells multiplying in an contained area
 The result i have become a half Indian version of Angelina Jolie (since only one breast was involved)! i told my doctor now is the time to give some competition to the Kardashians since Pamela is passé
 But no one listened to me, so now i have a portion of my back tissue in my breast
 Perhaps now i can do chin-ups with my breasts! Jokes apart, this obstacle has given me a new definition of life
 Respect it's unpredictability and have the faith and courage to be the hero of your own drama of life
 The invincible human spirit is God like, gives you the courage to endure and the will to revive
 There is nothing that human spirit can't do
 Also i want women of all ages to be aware
 i am 35, and i was returned twice over from a mammogram
 If any symptoms come up, think of it as a protective force and get yourselves examined
 Also we are so obsessed with boobs
 This mastectomy has left me with even more self love! Big, small, left or right inclined , gravity pulling or defying, or even none, each breast the presence or lack of it has a story to tell
 Mine has made me a 2
 0 version of myself! This post is dedicated to awareness, self love and resilience of a warrior that i know each one of us possesses❤️ # breastcancerawareness # selflove # determination # faith # bodhisattva # bodhisattvaoftheeartha post shared bytahirakashyap(@tahirakashyap) onsep 22, 2018 at 1:59am pdtwahira ne aspataal kii apni ek tasviir bhi share kii

 yadi koi lakshan aa jaataa he, to ise ek surakshatmak rup main sochen or khud kii jaanch karaaen
 Tahira wrote, "understand in simple terms, the initial stage (stage 0) / pre-cancerous stage is where the cancer causing cells are growing in one place
 natijatan main angelina joli kii aadhi bhartiya sanskaran ban gai hum (kyonki ek hi stan main cancer hua he) maine is baar apane doctor se kaha ki ab samay aa gaya he ki kardashiyaan ko kuch takkar di jaae kyonki pamela kaa samay biit chukaa he
 Ayushmann said that Tahira is fine and he has been discharged from the hospital after surgery

 wo jitegaa, isliye ye saamne nahin aaye or bali kaa bakra deviji (pragna) ko bana diya
 Taking a dig at the BJP and Pragya, Computer Baba said that our saintly saints are angry with the BJP that BJP people have given them (pragya) tickets, who have not respected our soldiers

 tab hue survey main indira gandhi ko 20 fisadi or atal bihari vaajapeyi ko 12 fisadi logon ne best piem mana tha
 In August 2017, 33 per cent of the people considered Narendra Modi as the best PM and then only 17 per cent considered Indira Gandhi as the best PM
 lekin pichley do survey se narendra modi kii lokapriyata main lagaataar giravat ai he
 On the basis of more popular religion among people of all religions, in the latest January 2019 survey, 20 percent of Hindus, 28 percent of Muslims and 24 percent of people of other religions are considered the best PM
 isi prakaar atal bihari vaajapeyi ko 20 fisadi hindu, 7 fisadi musalmaan or 4 fisadi anya dharmon ke log sarvshereshth piem maanate hai

 kshetravaar agar dekhen to uttar bharat ke 18 fisadi log, purv ke 22 fisadi, dakshin ke 20 fisadi or pashchim bharat ke 23 fisadi log indira gandhi ko ab tak kaa best piem maanate hai

 pakistan kii ek adaalat ne kot lakhapat jail main band bhartiya naagarik sarbajit singh kii bahan dalbir cor ko aaj usase milane kii ijaajat de di or vah kal jail main apane bhai se mil sakengi
 Sarabjit was sentenced to death for his alleged role in four bombings in Pakistan's Punjab province
 1990 main hue in dhamaakon main 14 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Lawyer Awais Sheikh of this Indian citizen imprisoned in Pakistan had filed a petition in the Lahore High Court requesting that Dalbir Kaur be allowed to visit his brother in jail

 The family claims that Sarabjit is innocent and has nothing to do with the bombings
 vah nashe kii haalat main seemaa paar kar pakistan chalaa gaya tha
 Sarabjit was to be hanged in 2008 but after the intervention of Pak Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, his death sentence was deferred indefinitely

 raajnneeti manmohan desai kii film kii tarah he, jo flashbek se shuru hoti he, jisamen do ladke apane parivesh ke bandhanon ko todakar bhaagate hai or pul se chalati rail par kudate samay hawa main hi bade ho jate hai
 Intermission is written on the screen
 film to samaapt ho jaati he, lekin hakeekat or antarvirodh kaa jo dhaancha hota he, vah asli or parde ke jivan par bana rahata he, isliye haar or jeet kisi kahani ke mode zarur ho sakate hai, magar zaruri nahin ki isse buniyadi sawaalon par bahut fark pad jaae
 Where are the expectations that Delhi raised in 2011-13? raajnneeti ko badalane ke sawaal gulzaar kaa gaanaa ga rahe honge - "meraa kuch saamaan tumhaare paas padaa he, ek sau solah chand kii raaten, ek tumhaare kaandhe kaa til, geeli menhadi kii khushbu, jhooth-mooth ke vaade, wo bhijwa do
 
 
 "it is not that Delhi is happy to come out of the theater to watch a fourth-class film like 'happy New Year' where morality only means victory
 chor jite, lekin india ke liye jite
 By the way, this film has also made a record of earnings
 kaala dhan or bhrashtachar kaa mudda ab latife main badal gaya he
 Lokpal's obsession is like a canopy in which the chair came from somewhere and the loudspeaker from somewhere
 sab apana-apana saamaan lekar chale gaye hai
 The Finance Minister advises the CAG that there can be many aspects to the policies
 jo faisla he, vah liya ja chukaa he, vah sansani na karen, hedline kii bhukh chhod den
 Then comes the explanation that the matter was cut out of context, but it is not told what that thing was, which got cut off
 hamaare netaa hi sampadak hai
 When the reference is finished, the issue is simply added to the slogan and when the edge of the slogan is appealed to understand the context, it is safe for them to decide
 har kisi ke khate main teen lakh aayega yaa nahin, ab yah aakrosh kii jagah latife kaa maamla ban gaya he
 When it was not known, why there was a demand for debate in Parliament, why there were adjournment, why the yatras were taken out
 ve dastauez kahaan se aae, jinke aadhaar par kaha gaya ki desh main lakhon karod kaa kalaadhan he
 On the radio, the Prime Minister says that no one knows how much black money is there, but they will bring it pie, trust them
 to kya bhrashtachar kaa vah mudda nakli tha, tab kyon netaa aise bol rahe the ki kisi ko pataa nahin tha
 There are two questions
 kaala dhan aane ko lekar, doosraa bhrashtachar mitaane ko lekar
 Have both these questions become so meaningless that now only jokes can be made on them
 agar yahi baat manmohan singh kehete ki unhen pataa nahin ki kitna kaala dhan he, tab 2013 kaa media or soshal media unke saath kya saluk karata
 Now Kiran Bedi, Baba Ramdev are all silent
 sabane is sawaal ko sirf ek vyakti ke bharose chhod diya he
 Then his question was something else, that the question of corruption cannot be left to any individual or government
 yah kaam sirf or sirf lokapal kar saktaa he
 Can you say with the claim that the same resentment is still there regarding Lokpal
 gyaarah maheene se lokapal nahin he or ab ise lekar koi bayaan bhi nahin he
 The question of corruption in the states is now almost silent
 jaise bhrashtachar centre sarkaar hi khatm karegi or vah bhi esaiti ke ye do jaj, jo is vakt vaikalpik lokapal kii tarah ummid banate hue prathit hote hai, lekin inkaa daawa bhi ajeeb he
 In a year, we will know about black money properly
 sawaal to lokapal jaise system kaa tha, jo is mahamari se ek ladaai kii shuruyaat karata
 This movement gave many heroes in politics
 yah or baat he ki inkaa naayakatv kisi or nayak main villin ho gaya
 Now every second-third 'tutpunjiya Movement' is also being called 'second Battle of Independence'
 dilli ke zyaadaatar bhrashtachar virdohi nayakon ne apni-apni nishthaaen ghoshit kar di hai, jinke aadhaar par inaki chuppi or mukharata tay ho rahi he
 Then there is neither corruption nor this time
 
 
 ' ek ummid tuutati thi to ek anshan aakar use sambhaal letaa tha
 Now all this has been turned into a gimmick
 jane-anjaane main efem radio ne loktantric aayojanon ko prahasan main badal diya he
 In 2013, Delhi could not properly decide its stand on the question of corruption
 jitna bijepi ko pasand kiya, utana hi aam aadmi party ko
 The punishment that Congress got was the same punishment across the country
 tab bijepi or aam aadmi party ek duusare se nahin, balki congress se lard rahe the
 This time the fight will change
 bijepi or aam aadmi party aamane-saamne hai or is ladaai main congress apane liye kuch jagah khoj rahi he
 But is the Aam Aadmi Party really going to attack the BJP from the front
 bijepi nahin, modi par waar karegi
 This fight will be made personal with the help of media, social media
 yahi vaastaviktaa he
 But will Delhi get out of this individualistic politics and make any sense on issues related to the system
 bahes kii disha ko badal paaegi
 Will the Aam Aadmi Party be able to recreate the sentiment that it did during those two years on the question of Jan Lokpal and corruption
 aam aadmi party apni sthapana kaa chunaav us mudde ke sahare ladegi, jiske aadhaar par vah kaayam hui thi
 Delhi of 2013 and 2014 has changed a lot
 dilli kaa chunaav is baar bhartiya raajnneeti kii disha tay kar degaa
 That is, now politics will be what the middle class wants
 vah is vakt raajnneeti ko tivi serial kii tarah dekh rahaa he, jahaan nae-nae kapadon main saje kirdaar use rulaate hai, to kabhi hansaate hai
 There is nothing for Delhi in this election
 jaise us chunaav main dilli ke liye kuch nahin tha
 The Aam Aadmi Party has now morphed into a political party
 ab un nausikhiye samajaseviyon kii fouj nahin rahi, jo raajnneeti ko badalane ke liye nikle the
 Its political contradictions also keep on coming
 jiske bheetar raajnneetik varchasv kii ladaai loksabhaa kii haar ke baad shuru hokar tham to gai thi, lekin is chunaav ke baad phir ubharegi
 The Delhi verdict will indicate what the political space will be for the new party in the future
 kabhi khatm nahin hoga, magar us spes ko lekar nae tarah ke sabak zarur kaayam honge
 At present, one thing is definitely in favor of the Aam Aadmi Party that its mlas are not broken
 kisi ne apni party se baahar se jaakar stand lete hue istipha dekar bijepi ke liye spes nahin banaaya
 Let us see whether Arvind Kejriwal abandons those issues or takes the help of them again
 yah chunaav jitna narendra modi kaa nahin hoga, utana arvind kejariwal kaa hoga
 Meanwhile, the public has seen him for some days in government and many days in opposition
 jis bhavukta or jaadu ke nirmaan karne kaa soshal median sansaadhan kejariwal kii team ne jutaya tha, use bijepi ne bade paimaane par apana liya he
 This election is also going to be a confrontation of the performance of the resources of the two parties
 sansadhano ke maamle main aam aadmi party bijepi se hameshaa kamazor rahegi, isliye 'aap' kaa asli imtahaan shuru hota he ab
 Delhi ji, be locked - speak in the style of Amitabh
 dekhte hai, dilli kise lock karti he
 Many people are saying that this election will be a 'do and die' election for the Aam Aadmi Party
 unka akalan he ki agar vipaksh laayak bani to party khatm ho jaaegi
 How does a party come to an end in opposition? kya maharashtra main 15 saal vipaksh main rahakar bijepi khatm ho gai thi
 Did the BJP end by staying out of power for 10 years at the Center
 lekin bhartiya raajnneeti main apane liye dilli jaisaa chota sandarbh or lakshya chunakar arvind kejariwal ne bhi khud ko in sawaalon ke ghere main nahin laa diya he
 Where else, if not Delhi
 is chunaav ke baad aam aadmi party kaa bhavishya bhi daanv par hoga
 i believe that the people of India are not honest on the question of corruption
 jo is mudde ko lekar aag main koodegaa, vah jalakar mar jayega
 The public is the beneficiary of the corruption system
 use apni anya nishthaaen bhrashtachar se upar lagati hai
 She has learned to live with corruption
 use is mudde or desh kii raajnneeti se 'stoffhome syndrome' ho gaya he
 He is in love with the oppressor
 agar arvind is dharna ko galat sabit kar dete hai to aam aadmi party modi ke varchasvvaadi raajnneeti or yug main phir se ummid banakar zindaa ho jaaegi
 The bet is only on 'you'
 bache rahane kaa or mit jane kaa
 This election is now with AAP and not by the people
 jo arvind kaha karte the ki chunaav janata kaa he, vahi jeetegi yaa vahi haaregi
 Just think
 bijepi kii jeet hui to narendra modi kaa kaisaa bakhaan hoga
 Modi continues to win
 unke failaae vrittanton ke anusaar hi bahasein chal rahi hai
 If the rest of the party and leaders are running away from their contradictions, then Modi is escaping every day by creating a new contradiction
 virdohi kanphyus hai ki modi par hamalaa karen yaa nahin
 Modi does not have such a confusion
 vah jab chaahate hai, jis par chaahate hai, hamale karte hai
 He takes not one, but a thousand arrows
 bina dekhe daaen-baayen chhodte rahete hai
 However, their every step is according to plan
 tivi or media ko sirf or sirf ek hi yoddha ladata hua dikhataa he or is duniya main jo dikhataa he, vahi bikta he
 Will Arvind Kejriwal be able to target Modi that way directly? bijepi unheen ke sahare to maidan main utregi
 There is also an opportunity for the Congress to try new leadership
 kya vah kuch khadi ho paaegi
 Sheila will take the help of Dixit or else a new leader will come
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga ki kya is baar bhi dilli kaa chunaav kisi raajnneetik badlaav kii chahat ke liye hoga
 Delhi has given up the dream of changing politics
 agar dilli main badlaav kii chahat hoti to vah bavana or trilokapuri kii ghatana par itani khamosh na hoti
 He may not be vocal in his support of these incidents, but the communal polarization of the people has been completed
 chunki securalism kii tarah yah bhi ek bed verde he, isliye dilli kaa nafis tabaka iskaa pradarshan nahin karegaa
 It will remain silent with the help of any other excuses
 bavana kii panchayat agar upi main hoti to ab tak kai sawaal akhilesh sarkaar par daage ja chuke hote ki sapa bijepi se mili hui he, taaki is dhruvikaran kaa laabh donon milakar uthaa len
 That aggression is missing in Delhi on the question of accountability
 kyon kisi ne nahin kaha ki jis dilli ke laal kile se 10 saal tak sampradayikta par roak lagaakar deshseva main jutane kaa aahvaan kiya gaya, usee dilli main kiski ijazat se mahapanchayatein ho rahi hai
 Why are there stress? kyon nahin aise vakt main pradhanmantri saarvajanik rup se daant lagaate hai ki band kiijie
 i keep an eye on such incidents
 vah bhi ek aise pradhanmantri se ummid to kii ja sakati he, jinka khaasaa samay media ke madhyamon main guzarataa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party also did not take out trips against communalism by taking a stand
 ghar-ghar jaakar logon se parche nahin baante
 The Congress and the AAP completed the formalities of making a media statement
 varna koi bavana ke samanaantar sauhaard panchayat karne kii bhi soch saktaa tha
 All are confused on this question, because they fear that like Lok Sabha, secularism should not suffer the loss of being a bad word
 yahi to raajnneeti he
 You should not give up your ideals even after taking loss
 lekin tab kya karenge, jab saamne vaala har tarah ke aadarshon kii tilanjali dekar jeetne par amada he
 This is the limit of electoral politics
 har kisi ko isamen funs janaa padataa he
 Morality is left for debate in TV studios
 sonakshi sinha kai baar sari main dikh chuki hai, phir chaahe vah filmon main ho yaa events main
 Now Sonakshi has worn nine different saris in a song from her upcoming film Lootera
 luteraa main sonakshi or ranvir singh pehali baar saath dikhenge
 The story of this film is based on the 1950s, due to which Sonakshi will be seen wearing a lot of saris
 'sanvaar luun' gane main sonakshi ke liye khaas tareeke se saadiyaan chuni gai thim, taaki us dashak kii jhalak dikhe
 Only Sonakshi had to wear nine types of saris for this song, which cost around Rs 3 lakh
 harek sari kii keemat 30,000- 35,000 ke bich thi
 Sonakshi says about this, 'vikram and his team created this look of mine
 film main adhiktar samay main sari main hi najar aauungi
 And i have become an expert on wearing it
 'savaar luun' main maine nau baar sari badali he or nattejey dekhakar lagata he ki yah mehnat bekaar nahin gai

 This time Bihar BJP President CP Thakur has come into the limelight by giving a statement on Modi's claim
 bihar bijepi adhyaksh ne modi kaa gungan karte hue kaha he ki agar modi aagaamee gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main hetric lagaate hai to piem ke liye unki daavedaari or majboot hogi
 On Modi's claim, he said that despite the media playing a negative role against Modi, if Modi wins then it is natural for his claim to be stronger
 iske alaava unhone yah bhi kaha ki hamaari party badi he, uske baad gathbandhan aata he

 i expected the Prime Minister to express similar concerns, but he failed to talk hard
 mukherjee ne buudhvaar ko pakistan ko chetavanee di thi ki ‘‘sanyam kii seemaa hoti he’’ or aatanrik suraksha sunishchit karne tathaa kshetreey akhandta ko surakshit rakhane ke liye ‘‘jaruri kadam ’’ uthaae jaaenge
 Describing the Prime Minister's speech as "a big disappointment", Modi said that there was no life in it and it failed to give any kind of inspiration
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, mujhe is baat par hairaani hoti he ki sarvaadhik baar rashtriya dhvaj fahraane vaali hastiyon main aapkaa naam shaamil ho rahaa he, lekin aap vahi baaten kar rahe hai jo pandit nehru ne raashtra ke naam apane pehle sambodhan main kahi thim

Criticizing the Center for not taking remedial steps to rectify the economic 'mess', Modi said that Singh could have done at least as much to tell the nation how he would strengthen the rupee and rejuvenate the economy
 What steps are being taken to put it
 unhone kaha, iske bajaay aap iskaa thikra vaishvik aarthik mandi ke sir par phod rahe hai or kehete hai ki bharat vaishvik mandi se achoota nahin rah saktaa
 Modi said, Indian soldiers have been killed and some encouraging things should have been said to encourage the soldiers
 main nahin samajhataa ki laal kila pakistan ko chunauti dene ke liye uchit manch he or na hi hamen isamen samay barbaad karnaa chahie, lekin yah hamaare sainya balon kaa manobal badhaane ke liye uchit manch tha
 He said, this is my feeling
 
 
 unhen (pradhanmantri) hamaare sainikon kaa manobal badhanaa chahie tha
 Modi said, on one hand the President is saying that our restraint is limited but what is the limit of this restraint, President? What is the boundary line for this
 
 
 iskaa faisla centre kii sarkaar ko karnaa hoga
 He said, what is the reason that we do not know
 
 
 hamaari seemaa kya he
 
 
 
 kab tak ham bardaasht karte rahenge
 
 isko saaf bataaya janaa chahie
 And it is not only a question of Pakistan, the security of the nation is in danger today
 unhone aarope lagaaya, china ne kya kiya he? ek aaazaad bharat main aaj china ghus aata he or hamaari seemaa par avarohak khadey kar detaa he
 
 
 He comes and touches our area
 bhrashtachar par raashtrapati dwaara jataai gai chintaaon kaa zikr karte hue modi ne kaha, bharat ke raashtrapati ne bhrashtachar par apni gahari chintaa jaahir kii he
 He expressed his sorrow over it in his speech on Wednesday
 behatar hota ki lalakile se bhi bhrashtachar ke bare main kuch bolaa jaataa
 He said, the Prime Minister is your first right to respect the feelings and concerns of the President, but that has not happened today
 modi ne sawalia andaaj main kaha, ham bhrashtachar ke khilaaf yuddh kyon nahin ched sakate or
 
 
 Brothers and sisters
 
 
 is bhrashtachar kaa janm kahaan se hua he ?
 
 
 Does the country not need to know this? unhone kaha, kya deshvasi is par jawaab nahin maangenge? main raajnneetik bhashaa main baat nahin karnaa chahta, lekin main kahana chahta hum ki bhrashtachar desh ke samaksh sabase mahatvapurn mudda he
 
 
 
 yah hamaare desh kaa dard, or santaap he
 Modi said, in the old-fashioned television serials, nepotism was the main reason for corruption
 
 
 samay badalane ke saath yah badal gaya he
 
 
 a new serial of maternal uncle and nephew came on corruption and now it is moving towards the transition of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law to serial
 modi ne gandhi parivaar ko paroksh rup se nishaanaa banaate hue kaha, bhrashtachar hamaare desh ko nasht kar rahaa he or jo desh par raaj kar rahe hai, unke parivaar aankath (bhrashtachar main) duube hai
 Until the Supreme Court reprimands them, they keep a constant silence and engage in it
 unhone kaha, isliye, bhaaiyon or bahanon, raashtrapatiji kaa bayaan ham sabhi se atmavlokan kaa aahvaan karata he or yah chintaa sheersh par honi chahie
 President Mukherjee said on Wednesday, corruption has become a major challenge
 desh ke amuly sansaadhan kahili tathaa udaseenta ke kaaran nasht ho rahe hai
 They are blunting the dynamics of our society
 hamen ise rokane kii jarurat he
 Modi, in his hour-long speech, also raised the issue of the Parliament being obstructed by the ruling party
 unhone kaha, yadi vipakshi dal apni aawaaj uthaate hai to loktantr main ise samajha ja saktaa he, lekin chintaa kii baat yah he ki desh main pehali baar sattarudh party loksabhaa nahin chalane de rahi he or uske kaamkaaj main baadha daal rahi he
 Modi said, he has made it an arena and if it is done by the ruling party then the crisis deepens and hence the concern you have expressed regarding the functioning of the President is genuine
 unhone sansad main vyavdhaan ke sambandh main raashtrapati kii chintaa ke jawaab main kaha, hamen loktantr ke mandir, sansad kaa garv banaae rakhane main apni ore se behatar prayaas karnaa chahie
 Modi in his speech attacked the Prime Minister for remembering only one family and forgetting all the other great leaders and said, Prime Minister, it is a matter of great disappointment that you talked about only one family from the Red Fort
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki aaj ke din aapako sardaar vallabh bhai patel ko yaad karnaa chahie tha, ek vyakti jisane bharat ko ekajute kiya, kya yah behatar nahin hota ki desh ko ekajute karne vaala acha sandesh diya jaataa
 Modi said, Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was the Prime Minister of your own party
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki jab aap pandit jawahar laal nehru, indira ji or rajeev ji kaa ullekh kar rahe the to aapane laal bahadur shastri ji kaa bhi ullekh kiya hota
 He has also been the Prime Minister of our country and gave the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, unhone jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha or bharat ke kisaanon ko prerit kiya or jo desh aazaadee ke baad bhi logon kaa pet bharne ke liye ann aayaat kar rahaa tha, tab, vahi insaan the, jinhone kisaanon ko prerit kiya
 You should have also named Shastriji
 unhone kaha, aapke raste main koi raajnneeti yaa vanshavaad kii raajnneeti nahin aani chahie thi
 But why did you do this
 
 
 
 i can understand that you may not remember Atal Bihari Vajpayee's name
 
 
 main aapaki majaburiyaan samajhataa hum, lekin aapako laal bahadur shastri ji kaa naam kyon nahin yaad aayaa
 
 
 
 mujhe yah baat hajam nahin ho rahi he
 After this Modi said, Sardar Patel, who devoted his entire life to the service of Congress, you do not remember that too, we are pained at this
 khaadya suraksha vidheyak or pradhanmantri ko is mudde par likhe patr kaa zikr karte hue modi ne kaha, behatar hota ki pradhanmantri desh ko yah bataate
 The comments unhone kaha, maine pradhanmantri ko ek patr likhaa he or suzav diya he ki khaadya suraksha vidheyak main kai khamiyaan hai, jinhen durust kiye jane kii jarurat he
 We have not opposed the Bill
 unhone kaha, ham garibon kii thali main khaanaa parose jane ke khilaaf nahin hai
 It is your responsibility to correct the shortcomings of this bill, but you (prime Minister) are not ready to listen to us
 modi ne kaha, garib logon kii thali main khaanaa parosane ke bajaay yah sarkaar garib logon kii thali main acid paros rahi he, namak chhidak rahi he
 He said, the Food Security Bill has failed to increase the number of beneficiaries, it has failed to raise the quality of food, it has failed to reduce the price of food
 
 
 or iske baavjood aap daawa kar rahe hai ki yah logon ke liye acha he
 Chief Minister Modi said, i am worried about the way this bill has ignored the foundation of our federal structure
 yah kuch kanoonee ladaai main funs saktaa he or garib log phir se bhojan suraksha se vanchit rah jaaenge
 He also said, "we want this bill to be a good bill and for this i had suggested to the Prime Minister that he should call a meeting of all Chief Ministers"
 yadi aapako garibon kii chintaa thi to aapako baithak bulaakar vidheyak kii kamiyon par vichaar karnaa chahie tha

 yadi aapako garibon kii chintaa thi to aapako baithak bulaakar vidheyak kii kamiyon par vichaar karnaa chahie tha
 In his spontaneous speech, Modi criticized the Prime Minister on various issues including India's response to Pakistan and China, corruption, the condition of the country's economy and the Food Security Bill
 unhone kaha, raashtra badlaav ke liye baichaiyn he
 He said, you are ruling a big country, we are handling a small state
 main pradhanmantri ko dilli main baithi sarkaar or hamaari sarkaar ke bich vikaas tathaa behatar prashasan ke mudde par saarvajanik bahes kii chunauti detaa hum
 Modi said this during his speech at the Independence Day celebrations held at Lalan College campus in Bhuj
 modi ne swatantraaa diwas kii purv sandhya par raashtrapati pranab mukherjee tathaa aaj die gaye pradhanmantri ke bhaashanon ke bich tulana kii or apane bhaashan main pakistan ke bare main kadaa rukh nahin apnaane ke liye manmohan singh kii aalochana kii
 Modi said, the President has expressed concern over the issue of the killing of our five soldiers
 mujhe ummid thi ki pradhanmantri isi prakaar kii chintaa jataayenge lekin vah kadi baat karne main vifal rahe
 Mukherjee on Wednesday warned Pakistan that "there is a limit to restraint" and that "necessary steps" will be taken to ensure internal security and preserve territorial integrity
 pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ko ‘‘badi niraashaa’’ bataate hue modi ne kaha ki isamen koi jaan nahin thi or yah kisi prakaar kii prerana dene main vifal rahaa he
 The Gujarat Chief Minister said, "I am surprised that your name is being included among the people who hoist the national flag most often, but you are saying the same things that Pandit Nehru said in his first address to the nation
" modi ne kaha ki singh aaj bhi unheen samasyaon or chintaaon kaa ullekh kar rahe hai jinka zikr nehru ne apane pehle bhaashan main kiya tha
 He questioned, the question arises what have you done in the last 60 years
 yadi halaat main maamuli-sa badlaav bhi nahin aayaa he
 
 
 So what have you done? Lashing out at the Prime Minister for the current economic situation, Modi said, Mr
 Prime Minister, you spoke of former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, referring to the current economic condition of the country, but i want to ask you that the way the value of rupee is falling
 , This is going towards crisis, who is responsible for it? aarthik ‘gadabadi’ ko durust karne ke liye upachaaratmak kadam nahin uthaane ke liye centre kii aalochana karte hue modi ne kaha ki singh kam se kam itnaa to kar sakate the ki ve desh ko bataate ki vah kaise rupee ko majboot karenge or arthvyavastha main nai jaan daalane ke liye kya kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 He said, instead you are blaming it on the head of global economic recession and says that India cannot remain untouched by the global recession
 modi ne kaha, bhartiya sainik maare gaye hai or javaanon kaa hausala badhaane ke liye kuch utsahjanak baaten kahi jaani chahie thim
 i do not think that the Red Fort is the appropriate platform to challenge Pakistan, nor should we waste time in it, but it was the appropriate platform to raise the morale of our military forces
 unhone kaha, yah meri bhaavana he
 
 
 He (prime Minister) should have boosted the morale of our soldiers
 modi ne kaha, ek taraf raashtrapatiji kah rahe hai ki hamaare sanyam kii seemaa he lekin raashtrapati ji is sanyam kii kya seemaa he? iske liye seemaa rekha kya he
 
 
 The central government will have to decide this
 unhone kaha, kya kaaran he ki hamen nahin pataa ki
 
 
 What is our limit 
 
 
 How long will we tolerate
 
 It should be clearly stated
 or yah keval pakistan kaa sawaal nahin he, aaj raashtra kii suraksha khatre main he
 He alleged, what has China done? Today China enters an independent India and creates barriers on our border
 
 
 vah hamaare kshetra main aakar dat jaataa he
 Referring to the concerns raised by the President on corruption, Modi said, the President of India has expressed his deep concern over corruption
 unhone buudhvaar ko apane bhaashan main is par apane dukh kaa izhaar kiya
 It would have been better to have spoken about corruption than the Red Fort
 unhone kaha, pradhanmantri ji raashtrapati ji kii bhaawanaaon or chintaaon kaa sammaan karnaa aapkaa pehla adhikaar he, lekin aaj aisa nahin hua
 Modi asked in a questioning manner, why can't we wage a war against corruption and
 
 
 bahanon-bhaaiyon
 
 
 Where is this corruption born from? 
 
 kya desh ko yah jaanane kii jarurat nahin he?
 He said, will the countrymen not ask for an answer on this? i do not want to speak in political language, but i want to say that corruption is the most important issue before the country
 
 
 
 This is the pain, and anguish of our country
 modi ne kaha, puraane jamaane ke televijan dharawahikon main bhai bhatijawad bhrashtachar kii mukhya vajah hota tha
 
 
 This has changed over time
 
 
 bhrashtachar par mamaa or bhaanje kaa nayaa dharawahik aayaa or ab yah saas, bahu or damaad ke serial main parivartit hone kii ore bad rahaa he
 Modi indirectly targeted the Gandhi family and said, "corruption is destroying our country and those who are ruling the country, their families are submerged (in corruption)"
 jab tak ucchtam nyaayalay unhen fatkaar nahin lagaataa, ve lagaataar chuppi saadhe rahete hai or isamen jute rahete hai
 He said, therefore, brothers and sisters, the statement of Rashtrapati calls upon all of us to introspect and this concern should be at the top
 raashtrapati mukherjee ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha, bhrashtachar ek mukhya chunauti ban gaya he
 The priceless resources of the country are being destroyed due to kohli and apathy
 yah hamaare samaaj kii gatishiltaa ko kund kar rahe hai
 We need to stop this
 modi ne apane ghantabar ke bhaashan main sattarudh party dwaara sansad ko baadhit kiye jane kaa mudda bhi uthaaya
 "it can be understood in a democracy if the opposition parties raise their voice, but what is worrying is that for the first time in the country, the ruling party is not allowing the Lok Sabha to run and is hindering its functioning," he said
 modi ne kaha, unhone ise akhaada bana diya he or yadi aisa sattarudh party dwaara kiya jaataa he to sankat gaharaa ho jaataa he or isliye raashtrapati ji sansad ke kaamkaaj ke sambandh main aapke dwaara jataai gai chintaa vaastavik he
 He said in response to the President's concern about the disruption of Parliament, we should do our best to maintain the pride of Parliament, the temple of democracy
 modi ne apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri dwaara keval ek parivaar ko yaad karne or baaki sabhi anya mahaan netaaon ko bhuulane ke liye pradhanmantri par hamalaa bolaa or kaha, pradhanmantri ji, badi niraashaa kii baat he ki lalakile se aapane keval ek parivaar ke bare main bolaa
 Is it not better that today you should have remembered Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a person who united India, would it not have been better if a good message that united the country was given
 modi ne kaha, pradhanmantri ji, laal bahadur shastri, aapaki apni party ke pradhanmantri the
 Is it not better that when you were mentioning Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira ji and Rajiv ji, you would have also mentioned Lal Bahadur Shastri ji
 vah bhi hamaare desh ke pradhanmantri rahe hai or unhone jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat said, he had given the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and inspired the farmers of India and the country which was importing food to feed the people even after independence, then, it was humans who had farmers Inspired
 aapako shastri ji kaa bhi naam lenaa chahie tha
 He said, no politics or politics of dynasty should have come in your way
 lekin aapane aisa kyon kiya
 
 
 
 main samaj saktaa hum ki aapako atal bihari vaajapeyi ji kaa naam yaad nahin rahaa hoga
 
 
 i understand your compulsions, but why you did not remember the name of Lal Bahadur Shastriji
 
 
 
 i am not digesting this

 The Chief Minister of Gujarat said, he had given the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and inspired the farmers of India and the country which was importing food to feed the people even after independence, then, it was humans who had farmers Inspired
 aapako shastri ji kaa bhi naam lenaa chahie tha

 Modi in his speech attacked the Prime Minister for remembering only one family and forgetting all the other great leaders and said, Prime Minister, it is a matter of great disappointment that you talked about only one family from the Red Fort
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki aaj ke din aapako sardaar vallabh bhai patel ko yaad karnaa chahie tha, ek vyakti jisane bharat ko ekajute kiya, kya yah behatar nahin hota ki desh ko ekajute karne vaala acha sandesh diya jaataa

 But why did you do this
 
 
 
 i can understand that you may not remember Atal Bihari Vajpayee's name

 Chief Minister Modi said, i am worried about the way this bill has ignored the foundation of our federal structure
 yah kuch kanoonee ladaai main funs saktaa he or garib log phir se bhojan suraksha se vanchit rah jaaenge
 He also said, "we want this bill to be a good bill and for this i had suggested to the Prime Minister that he should call a meeting of all Chief Ministers"

 So what have you done? Lashing out at the Prime Minister for the current economic situation, Modi said, Mr
 Prime Minister, you spoke of former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, referring to the current economic condition of the country, but i want to ask you that the way the value of rupee is falling

 The Chief Minister of Gujarat said, he had given the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and inspired the farmers of India and the country which was importing food to feed the people even after independence, then, it was humans who had farmers Inspired

 And yet you are claiming that it is good for the people
 mukhyamantri modi ne kaha, is vidheyak ne jis tarah se hamaare sangheey dhaanche kii buniyaad kii andekhi kii he, main usase chintit hum
 It can get caught in some legal battles and poor people will again be deprived of food security
 unhone iske saath hi kaha, ham chaahate hai ki yah vidheyak ek acha vidheyak ho or iske liye maine pradhanmantri ko suzav diya tha ki vah sabhi mukhyamantriyon kii baithak bulaaen
 If you were concerned about the poor, you should have called a meeting and considered the shortcomings of the bill

 If you were concerned about the poor, you should have called a meeting and considered the shortcomings of the bill
 unhone kaha, yah meri bhaavana he
 
 
 He (prime Minister) should have boosted the morale of our soldiers
 modi ne kaha, ek taraf raashtrapatiji kah rahe hai ki hamaare sanyam kii seemaa he lekin raashtrapati ji is sanyam kii kya seemaa he? iske liye seemaa rekha kya he

 Referring to the concerns raised by the President on corruption, Modi said, the President of India has expressed his deep concern over corruption
 unhone buudhvaar ko apane bhaashan main is par apane dukh kaa izhaar kiya

 unhone kaha, pradhanmantri ji raashtrapati ji kii bhaawanaaon or chintaaon kaa sammaan karnaa aapkaa pehla adhikaar he, lekin aaj aisa nahin hua
 Modi asked in a questioning manner, why can't we wage a war against corruption and
 
 
 bahanon-bhaaiyon
 
 
 Where is this corruption born from? 
 
 kya desh ko yah jaanane kii jarurat nahin he?
 He said, will the countrymen not ask for an answer on this? i do not want to speak in political language, but i want to say that corruption is the most important issue before the country
 
 
 
 This is the pain, and anguish of our country

 Modi indirectly targeted the Gandhi family and said, "corruption is destroying our country and those who are ruling the country, their families are submerged (in corruption)"
 jab tak ucchtam nyaayalay unhen fatkaar nahin lagaataa, ve lagaataar chuppi saadhe rahete hai or isamen jute rahete hai
 He said, therefore, brothers and sisters, the statement of Rashtrapati calls upon all of us to introspect and this concern should be at the top

 "it can be understood in a democracy if the opposition parties raise their voice, but what is worrying is that for the first time in the country, the ruling party is not allowing the Lok Sabha to run and is hindering its functioning," he said
 modi ne kaha, unhone ise akhaada bana diya he or yadi aisa sattarudh party dwaara kiya jaataa he to sankat gaharaa ho jaataa he or isliye raashtrapati ji sansad ke kaamkaaj ke sambandh main aapke dwaara jataai gai chintaa vaastavik he

 He expressed his sorrow over it in his speech on Wednesday
 behatar hota ki lalakile se bhi bhrashtachar ke bare main kuch bolaa jaataa
 He said, the Prime Minister is your first right to respect the feelings and concerns of the President, but that has not happened today
 modi ne sawalia andaaj main kaha, ham bhrashtachar ke khilaaf yuddh kyon nahin ched sakate or
 
 
 Brothers and sisters
 
 
 is bhrashtachar kaa janm kahaan se hua he ?
 
 
 Does the country not need to know this? unhone kaha, kya deshvasi is par jawaab nahin maangenge? main raajnneetik bhashaa main baat nahin karnaa chahta, lekin main kahana chahta hum ki bhrashtachar desh ke samaksh sabase mahatvapurn mudda he
 
 
 
 yah hamaare desh kaa dard, or santaap he
 Modi said, in the old-fashioned television serials, nepotism was the main reason for corruption
 
 
 samay badalane ke saath yah badal gaya he
 
 
 a new serial of maternal uncle and nephew came on corruption and now it is moving towards the transition of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law to serial
 modi ne gandhi parivaar ko paroksh rup se nishaanaa banaate hue kaha, bhrashtachar hamaare desh ko nasht kar rahaa he or jo desh par raaj kar rahe hai, unke parivaar aankath (bhrashtachar main) duube hai
 Until the Supreme Court reprimands them, they keep a constant silence and engage in it

 President Mukherjee said on Wednesday, corruption has become a major challenge
 desh ke amuly sansaadhan kahili tathaa udaseenta ke kaaran nasht ho rahe hai
 They are blunting the dynamics of our society
 hamen ise rokane kii jarurat he
 Modi, in his hour-long speech, also raised the issue of the Parliament being obstructed by the ruling party
 unhone kaha, yadi vipakshi dal apni aawaaj uthaate hai to loktantr main ise samajha ja saktaa he, lekin chintaa kii baat yah he ki desh main pehali baar sattarudh party loksabhaa nahin chalane de rahi he or uske kaamkaaj main baadha daal rahi he
 Modi said, he has made it an arena and if it is done by the ruling party then the crisis deepens and hence the concern you have expressed regarding the functioning of the President is genuine
 unhone sansad main vyavdhaan ke sambandh main raashtrapati kii chintaa ke jawaab main kaha, hamen loktantr ke mandir, sansad kaa garv banaae rakhane main apni ore se behatar prayaas karnaa chahie
 Modi in his speech attacked the Prime Minister for remembering only one family and forgetting all the other great leaders and said, Prime Minister, it is a matter of great disappointment that you talked about only one family from the Red Fort
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki aaj ke din aapako sardaar vallabh bhai patel ko yaad karnaa chahie tha, ek vyakti jisane bharat ko ekajute kiya, kya yah behatar nahin hota ki desh ko ekajute karne vaala acha sandesh diya jaataa
 Modi said, Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was the Prime Minister of your own party
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki jab aap pandit jawahar laal nehru, indira ji or rajeev ji kaa ullekh kar rahe the to aapane laal bahadur shastri ji kaa bhi ullekh kiya hota
 He has also been the Prime Minister of our country and gave the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, unhone jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha or bharat ke kisaanon ko prerit kiya or jo desh aazaadee ke baad bhi logon kaa pet bharne ke liye ann aayaat kar rahaa tha, tab, vahi insaan the, jinhone kisaanon ko prerit kiya
 You should have also named Shastriji
 unhone kaha, aapke raste main koi raajnneeti yaa vanshavaad kii raajnneeti nahin aani chahie thi
 But why did you do this
 
 
 
 i can understand that you may not remember Atal Bihari Vajpayee's name
 
 
 main aapaki majaburiyaan samajhataa hum, lekin aapako laal bahadur shastri ji kaa naam kyon nahin yaad aayaa
 
 
 
 mujhe yah baat hajam nahin ho rahi he
 After this Modi said, Sardar Patel, who devoted his entire life to the service of Congress, you do not remember that too, we are pained at this
 khaadya suraksha vidheyak or pradhanmantri ko is mudde par likhe patr kaa zikr karte hue modi ne kaha, behatar hota ki pradhanmantri desh ko yah bataate
 The comments unhone kaha, maine pradhanmantri ko ek patr likhaa he or suzav diya he ki khaadya suraksha vidheyak main kai khamiyaan hai, jinhen durust kiye jane kii jarurat he
 We have not opposed the Bill
 unhone kaha, ham garibon kii thali main khaanaa parose jane ke khilaaf nahin hai
 It is your responsibility to correct the shortcomings of this bill, but you (prime Minister) are not ready to listen to us
 modi ne kaha, garib logon kii thali main khaanaa parosane ke bajaay yah sarkaar garib logon kii thali main acid paros rahi he, namak chhidak rahi he
 He said, the Food Security Bill has failed to increase the number of beneficiaries, it has failed to raise the quality of food, it has failed to reduce the price of food
 
 
 or iske baavjood aap daawa kar rahe hai ki yah logon ke liye acha he
 Chief Minister Modi said, i am worried about the way this bill has ignored the foundation of our federal structure
 yah kuch kanoonee ladaai main funs saktaa he or garib log phir se bhojan suraksha se vanchit rah jaaenge
 He also said, "we want this bill to be a good bill and for this i had suggested to the Prime Minister that he should call a meeting of all Chief Ministers"
 yadi aapako garibon kii chintaa thi to aapako baithak bulaakar vidheyak kii kamiyon par vichaar karnaa chahie tha

 He has also been the Prime Minister of our country and gave the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan

 Modi said, he has made it an arena and if it is done by the ruling party then the crisis deepens and hence the concern you have expressed regarding the functioning of the President is genuine
 unhone sansad main vyavdhaan ke sambandh main raashtrapati kii chintaa ke jawaab main kaha, hamen loktantr ke mandir, sansad kaa garv banaae rakhane main apni ore se behatar prayaas karnaa chahie
 Modi in his speech attacked the Prime Minister for remembering only one family and forgetting all the other great leaders and said, Prime Minister, it is a matter of great disappointment that you talked about only one family from the Red Fort
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki aaj ke din aapako sardaar vallabh bhai patel ko yaad karnaa chahie tha, ek vyakti jisane bharat ko ekajute kiya, kya yah behatar nahin hota ki desh ko ekajute karne vaala acha sandesh diya jaataa
 Modi said, Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was the Prime Minister of your own party
 kya yah behatar nahin hota ki jab aap pandit jawahar laal nehru, indira ji or rajeev ji kaa ullekh kar rahe the to aapane laal bahadur shastri ji kaa bhi ullekh kiya hota
 He has also been the Prime Minister of our country and gave the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, unhone jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha or bharat ke kisaanon ko prerit kiya or jo desh aazaadee ke baad bhi logon kaa pet bharne ke liye ann aayaat kar rahaa tha, tab, vahi insaan the, jinhone kisaanon ko prerit kiya
 You should have also named Shastriji
 unhone kaha, aapke raste main koi raajnneeti yaa vanshavaad kii raajnneeti nahin aani chahie thi
 But why did you do this
 
 
 
 i can understand that you may not remember Atal Bihari Vajpayee's name
 
 
 main aapaki majaburiyaan samajhataa hum, lekin aapako laal bahadur shastri ji kaa naam kyon nahin yaad aayaa
 
 
 
 mujhe yah baat hajam nahin ho rahi he
 After this Modi said, Sardar Patel, who devoted his entire life to the service of Congress, you do not remember that too, we are pained at this

 The comments unhone kaha, maine pradhanmantri ko ek patr likhaa he or suzav diya he ki khaadya suraksha vidheyak main kai khamiyaan hai, jinhen durust kiye jane kii jarurat he
 We have not opposed the Bill
 unhone kaha, ham garibon kii thali main khaanaa parose jane ke khilaaf nahin hai
 It is your responsibility to correct the shortcomings of this bill, but you (prime Minister) are not ready to listen to us
 modi ne kaha, garib logon kii thali main khaanaa parosane ke bajaay yah sarkaar garib logon kii thali main acid paros rahi he, namak chhidak rahi he
 He said, the Food Security Bill has failed to increase the number of beneficiaries, it has failed to raise the quality of food, it has failed to reduce the price of food
 
 
 or iske baavjood aap daawa kar rahe hai ki yah logon ke liye acha he
 Chief Minister Modi said, i am worried about the way this bill has ignored the foundation of our federal structure
 yah kuch kanoonee ladaai main funs saktaa he or garib log phir se bhojan suraksha se vanchit rah jaaenge
 He also said, "we want this bill to be a good bill and for this i had suggested to the Prime Minister that he should call a meeting of all Chief Ministers"
 yadi aapako garibon kii chintaa thi to aapako baithak bulaakar vidheyak kii kamiyon par vichaar karnaa chahie tha
 Modi indirectly targeted the Gandhi family and said, "corruption is destroying our country and those who are ruling the country, their families are submerged (in corruption)"
 jab tak ucchtam nyaayalay unhen fatkaar nahin lagaataa, ve lagaataar chuppi saadhe rahete hai or isamen jute rahete hai
 He said, therefore, brothers and sisters, the statement of Rashtrapati calls upon all of us to introspect and this concern should be at the top
 raashtrapati mukherjee ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha, bhrashtachar ek mukhya chunauti ban gaya he
 The priceless resources of the country are being destroyed due to kohli and apathy
 yah hamaare samaaj kii gatishiltaa ko kund kar rahe hai
 We need to stop this
 modi ne apane ghantabar ke bhaashan main sattarudh party dwaara sansad ko baadhit kiye jane kaa mudda bhi uthaaya
 "it can be understood in a democracy if the opposition parties raise their voice, but what is worrying is that for the first time in the country, the ruling party is not allowing the Lok Sabha to run and is hindering its functioning," he said
 modi ne kaha, unhone ise akhaada bana diya he or yadi aisa sattarudh party dwaara kiya jaataa he to sankat gaharaa ho jaataa he or isliye raashtrapati ji sansad ke kaamkaaj ke sambandh main aapke dwaara jataai gai chintaa vaastavik he
 He said in response to the President's concern about the disruption of Parliament, we should do our best to maintain the pride of Parliament, the temple of democracy
 modi ne apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri dwaara keval ek parivaar ko yaad karne or baaki sabhi anya mahaan netaaon ko bhuulane ke liye pradhanmantri par hamalaa bolaa or kaha, pradhanmantri ji, badi niraashaa kii baat he ki lalakile se aapane keval ek parivaar ke bare main bolaa
 Is it not better that today you should have remembered Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a person who united India, would it not have been better if a good message that united the country was given
 modi ne kaha, pradhanmantri ji, laal bahadur shastri, aapaki apni party ke pradhanmantri the
 Is it not better that when you were mentioning Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira ji and Rajiv ji, you would have also mentioned Lal Bahadur Shastri ji
 vah bhi hamaare desh ke pradhanmantri rahe hai or unhone jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa diya tha
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat said, he had given the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and inspired the farmers of India and the country which was importing food to feed the people even after independence, then, it was humans who had farmers Inspired
 aapako shastri ji kaa bhi naam lenaa chahie tha
 He said, no politics or politics of dynasty should have come in your way
 lekin aapane aisa kyon kiya
 
 
 
 main samaj saktaa hum ki aapako atal bihari vaajapeyi ji kaa naam yaad nahin rahaa hoga
 
 
 i understand your compulsions, but why you did not remember the name of Lal Bahadur Shastriji
 
 
 
 i am not digesting this
 modi ne iske baad kaha, sardaar patel, jinhone puraa jivan congress kii seva main laga diya, aapako vah bhi yaad nahin rahe, is par hamen dil main pidaa hoti he

 He said, we are not against serving food in the plate of the poor
 is vidheyak kii kamiyon ko sahi karnaa aapaki jimmedaari he, lekin aap (pradhanmantri) hamaari baat sunne ko taiyaar hi nahin hai
 Modi said, instead of serving food in the plate of poor people, this government is serving acid in the plate of poor people, sprinkling salt
 unhone kaha, khaadya suraksha vidheyak labhaarthiyon kii sankhya badhaane main vifal rahaa he, yah bhojan kii gunvattta badhaane main vifal rahaa he, yah bhojan kii keemat kam karne main vifal rahaa he
 
 
 And yet you are claiming that it is good for the people
 mukhyamantri modi ne kaha, is vidheyak ne jis tarah se hamaare sangheey dhaanche kii buniyaad kii andekhi kii he, main usase chintit hum
 It can get caught in some legal battles and poor people will again be deprived of food security
 unhone iske saath hi kaha, ham chaahate hai ki yah vidheyak ek acha vidheyak ho or iske liye maine pradhanmantri ko suzav diya tha ki vah sabhi mukhyamantriyon kii baithak bulaaen
 If you were concerned about the poor, you should have called a meeting and considered the shortcomings of the bill

 President Mukherjee said on Wednesday, corruption has become a major challenge

 After the crushing defeat in the assembly elections of 3 states of the Hindi belt recently, a fresh strategy has to be devised for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to win the next year's Lok Sabha elections
 is bich sutron kaa kahana he ki centre kii narendra modi sarkaar loksabhaa chunaav se pehle ek aisi yojana laane kii taiyaari kar rahi he, jo chunaav ke dauraan 'game changer' sabit ho sakati he
 According to sources, this central government scheme is also two steps ahead of the farmers' loan waiver scheme
 is skim ko UBI yani Universal Basic Income skim mana ja rahaa he
 The scheme will cover all the citizens of the country, including farmers, businessmen and unemployed youth
 is yojana ke tahat desh ke har naagarik ko 2,000 se 2,500 rupee tak har maheene die ja sakate hai
 The government will directly transfer a fixed amount to the bank accounts of all citizens with zero income
 jiro inakam vaale nagarikon kaa matlab saaf he ki wo naagarik jinke paas kamai kaa koi jariya nahin he
 The government is also considering a separate scheme for farmers, under which the losses of farmers who sell crops at low prices will be compensated
 nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye jo bhi rakam di jaaegi, wo sidhe kisaanon ke bank khate main transfar kii jaaegi
 According to sources, the PMO will also have a meeting with different ministries soon so that the scheme of the scheme can be prepared as soon as possible
 khate main kaise aayega paisa?universal basic inakam yojanako lagu karne ke liye aadhaar number kaa istemaal kiya jayega
 The bank account of the citizen joining the scheme will be linked to the Aadhaar number and then the money given by the government will be directly transferred to his account
 abhi tak gharelu gas silendar par milane vaali sabsidi khate main transfar hoti thi, lekin ho saktaa he ki is skim ke lagu hone ke baad har tarah kii sabsidi band kar di jaae
 ideaubi was first suggested by a London professor, Professor Guy Standing of London University, who led a pilot project for five years in 8 villages near Indore, Madhya Pradesh
 trial ke taur par in gaanvon kii 6,000 kii aabaadi ke bich 2010 se 2016 ke bich is project ko chalaaya gaya
 Then 500 rupees were added to the bank account of the villagers every month
 vahiin bacchon ke khate main 150 rupee jamaa karaae gaye
 People benefited greatly from this
 prayog ke safal hone ke baad professor standing ne daawa kiya ki modi sarkaar is skim ko lagu karne ke liye gambhir he
 Initially, this scheme can include people on the basis of Economic Survey 2011
 is skim kii charchaa lambey samay se kii ja rahi thi, lekin kaha ja rahaa he ki haal hi main vibhinn mantralayon se is sambandh main raay maangi gai he
 About 100 million people can be covered under this scheme
 saal 2016-17 ke aarthik survey main sarkaar ko is skim ko lagu karne kii salaah di gai thi
 It is expected that this big scheme may be announced in the New Year budget

 lekin team ke sadasyon ko bharosa he ki wo england par jeet hasil karenge

 imran khan par yah ehsaas takreeban fouran hi tari ho gaya
 At the election stump, he used to make fun of his arch rival then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for communicating with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chanting - "modi's friend, he is a traitor"
 ek hafte baad jab chunaav nateezon ne dikhaaya ki unki party pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitii) sarkaar banane kii haalat main he, to khan kaa sur badla or ve mail-milaap kii baaten karne lage
 He promised that if Modi takes a step forward towards improving the relationship between the two countries, he will take two steps forward
 jab modi ne 30 july ko shaleentavash mubaarakabaad or shubhakamana dene ke liye khan ko phone kiya, tab donon ne ummid jaahir kii ki ve hindustan-pakistan ke rishton main ek nai pari kii shuruyaat kar sakenge
 The good thing with Khan is that when it comes to improving relations with Hindustan, the expectations from him are very low
 lihaaja agar ve chizon ko aage le jane kii garaj se ek bilkul chota-sa kadam bhi badhaate hai, to vah bada-sa dikhegaa
 This is also because Sharif, who made a broad promise in 2013 when he was elected Prime Minister for the third time, did nothing more than shake hands and make mistakes
 donon mulkon ke bich rishte paravaan chadhgaye kii bajaae pichley teen saal ke dauraan ek nae rasaatal main chale gaye
 The formal negotiation process could not be resumed, tensions rose to extinction by Pakistan's fragile state of Kashmir, the 2003 agreement for ceasefire along the Line of Control loomed after repeated violations - Even after a series of terrorist attacks, one after another, to warn Pakistan to desist from terror across the border, India 16 really had to resort to surgical strikes
 khan aise behad najuk mode par kaman sambhaal rahe hai jab mushkilon se ghira unka mulk na keval apane bhitari utaar-chadhaavon ke lihaaj se balki duusare deshon khaskar hindustan se apane rishton ke lihaaj se bhi ahm doraahe par khadaa he
 In his argument for Fatah, Khan complained that Hindustan had presented him as a villain of Bollywood
 unhen behatar pataa hona chahie tha ki yah vah mulk he jo cricket ko utana hi pyaar karata he jitna unka apana mulk karata he
 Khan is still a cricketing hero in India and his 1992 World Cup victory is considered not just a victory for Pakistan but a victory for the subcontinent
 ab jab 11 agast ko khan pakistan kii siyaasi captaini sambhaal rahe hai, unhen jarur yaad rakhana chahie ki hindustani riyaaya ke dilon main unke liye swaabhaavik sadbhaavna he
 And they should not lose it lightly
 ab yah sab jaanate hai ki pakistani fouj ne ladaai par amada sharif ko gaddi se bedakhal karne kii garaj se hi unke siyaasi ubhaar kaa samarthan kiya tha
 But as former National Security Advisor and Pakistan expert Shivshankar Menon puts it, "even though everyone has dismissed Khan as an army soldier, but when politics sits on the throne, it is not a man but his position of rank - Shields establishes her relationship with the establishment
 ve khud apane dharm kaa paalan karenge, thik vaise hi jaise fouj ke pramukh apane dharm kaa karte hai
 "experts give Khan six months to take over the reins when he starts displaying his free speech and his ability to assert himself, which has also been his specialty as a cricket captain
" cricket or samaaj, donon ke iken hone ke naate apane asal kad se kahin zyada bade or oonche hone kaa jo ehsaas unhone viksit kar liya he, usne unhen apane zyaadaatar purvavartiyon kii banisbat bartaav main or bhi zyada shahi or munhjor bana diya he
 Almost all Indian leaders have found that dealing with Pakistan is more complicated and difficult than any other country
 aisa isliye he kyonki koi ek nahin balki kai pakistan hai jinase ek saath nipatna hota he
 As wazir-azam, Imran Khan represents an important face of Pakistan, but only one of them
 vahaan taqatvar pakistani fouj bhi he jo videsh niti or aantarik suraksha par apni pakad or bhi majboot karne kii koshish karegi
 Then there are right-wing Islamic factions — including militants who tried to get into the political mainstream by contesting elections under the leadership of the military, though they did not succeed
 or vahaan teji se badhati civil socity bhi he jo chaahati he ki mulk teji se viksit ho or apane aakankshi yuvaaon ko naukariyaan muhaiyaa karaae
 Khan represents an intriguing duplication
 aadhuniktaa ke saath apane subhite ko unhone banaae rakhaa he, yahaan tak ki tab bhi jab unhone apni siyaasi sambhaavnaaon ko aage badhaane ke liye dakshinpanthi dakiyanoosee dhadon ke samarthan ko gale lagaaya, jaisaa ki unhone fouj ke maamle main bhi kiya
 Former High Commissioner in Pakistan T
 si
 a
 raghavan kehete hai, "ek baat saaf samaj leni chahie ki imran 100 fisadi fouj ke aadmi nahin hai—ve apane dam par netaa hai
 His convenience with the military may be greater than that of his predecessors — it is not a bad thing for us
 '' darasal, hindustan ke liye khan ke saath pesh aana sharif ke mukaable kahin zyada aasaan ho saktaa he, kyonki kam se kam ve jab kehete hai ki ve kuch karenge, tab unki peeth par fouj kaa haath hoga
 Therefore, the duplication that Hindustan had to deal with while dealing with other Pakistani leaders may not be as strong
 misaal ke liye sharif kaa fouj ke saath khulaa takaraav hua, jisane phir unhen gaddi se bedakhal karne ke liye kaam kiya
 Khan has witnessed the fate of political leaders who have been messing with the army chief in Pakistan and it is likely that they will take precaution
 tis par bhi pakistan par najar rakhane vaale tajurbekaar maanate hai ki islamabad main asainya netritv ke shikhar par badlaav kaa nateeja jaruri nahin ki hindustan ke saath uske rishton main yathasthiti ke badalane kii shakl main bhi saamne aae
 Sharat Sabharwal, another former High Commissioner in Pakistan, underlined the reason for this, saying, "the army is steadfast in its place and with Sharif's ouster, relations with India are on a decline
" '' sabharwal pitii ke ghoshnaptr main, khaskar usamen bataae gaye videsh niti ke uddeshyon ko lekar, koi dilasa nahin khoj pate
 This Declaration on Kashmir proclaims that this is a core issue, but reminds us of the age-old rhetoric by calling for resolution of the dispute within the scope of UN Security Council resolutions
 donon hi desh bahut pehle is padaav se kaaphi aage aa chuke hai or iske kisi bhi zikr ko pakistan kii atakane kii chaal ke taur par hi dekha jayega
 Of greater concern to Sabharwal is that Khan views the "declaration of Conflict as the most practical way to resolve conflicts and cooperate" to resolve issues with Hindustan
 iskaa matlab yah he ki khan kii sarkaar takaraav ke samaadhaan par to or ooncha daanv khelegi, jabaki vyapaar sahit duusare morchon par rishte sudhaarney kaa koi zikr nahin he
 Menon also believes that there will be no fundamental change in the relationship, because the Pakistan Army does not want to do so
 menon kehete hai, "paak fouj ke liye yah sthiti mufeed he
 After the election, the army generals now have a weak coalition government and this is what they wanted
 ve bharat ke saath dushmani kaa niyantrit str banaae rakh sakate hai taaki uskaa phayda uthaakar ve gharelu maamalon par pakad banaae rakh saken
 This would give Khan so much scope that he would be able to give a little hand and foot to talks on Kashmir to keep Hindustan busy and the army general would focus on ensuring that his grip and influence on Afghanistan remains
 america raashtrapati donald trump afghanistan main america kii shirkat ko khatm karne ke liye utsuk hai or unke afasaron ne pakistan ko aagaah kar diya he ki vah jab tak kabul main uske mansoobon ko puraa karne main saath nahin detaa, america use iemef se karje ke sahare mushkilon se baahar nahin nikalne degaa
 So can Modi work with Khan? Modi's team is watching carefully what kind of advisors Khan appoints on foreign policy, and on the basis of this, it will test his honesty and influence
 unki taraf se ek baat saaf he ki rishton main tab tak aage nahin badha ja saktaa he jab tak pakistan hindustan par hamale karne ke liye dehshatgardon ke dhadon ko apni sarajameen kaa istemaal karne se rokane ke liye raji nahin hota or saath hi yah bhi pakkaa nahin karata ki niyantran rekha par sangharsh viraam samjhauta lagu ho
 If Khan can deal with these issues, then India is ready for talks
 fori sawaal yah he ki agar khan apane shapath grahan samaaroh main aane kaa nyauta dete hai to modi ko pakistan janaa chahie yaa nahin
 The general opinion of experts is that they should accept this invitation
 aisa karke ve duniya ko phir yah dikhaaenge ki modi pakistan se aman-chaiyn ke rishte rakhane kii apni koshishon main eemaandaar hai or yah islamabad hi he jo rukaawat bana hua he
 This will allow Modi to go to Pakistan and meet Khan without any expectations and expectations from the Indian public about any agenda or outcome
 aamane-saamne mulaakaat se modi ko netaa ke taur par khan ko aankane main bhi madad milegi or ve yah bhi bhaanp paaenge ki ve apane vaadon par khare utar paaenge yaa nahin or saajha hit ke ahm muddon par kaam kar sakenge yaa nahin
 Raghavan believes that in both countries there is a growing section of people who would like to see the deadlock break in two-way relationships
 haal ke vakt main duniya ne naatakeey badlaav dekhe hai—chaahe ve do korea ke bich hon, antarrashtriya vyapaar or nato ko lekar america kaa ravaiya ho or china main shi jinping kaa utthan ho
 There is no reason why this subcontinent should remain an exception to this long period of change
 aakhir khan nae pakistan ke naare par hi to satta main aae hai

 june maheene kii shuruyaat ho gai, lekin abhi tak bihar ke saat jilon main kisaanon se chhataank bhar gehun kii bhi adhiprapti (sarkari kharid) nahin hui he
 Due to no purchase of wheat, the middlemen are buying wheat at a quarter to one price

 Shyamji Pandey, a farmer from Amba in Aurangabad district, says that wheat was cultivated this year with great enthusiasm and due to this farming, many dreams were also cherished
 lekin abhi tak kharid shuru nahin ho paane ke kaaran agali kheti karne, mahajanon kaa karj chukaane or apni anya jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye oune-paune daam main gehun bech rahe hai
 Many farmers have the same situation
 sahakaarita vibhaag ke ek adhikari ne naam jaahir na karne kii shart par bataaya ki bihar ke 38 jilon main se saat jilon- vaishali, saaran, shekhpura, katihaar, madhubani, aurangabad or jamui main ab tak gehun kii kharid shuru nahin ho pai he
 He said that the procurement of wheat was to be started from April 1 this year, but could not start due to Lok Sabha elections, procurement has been started since last fortnight
 sahakaarita vibhaag ke apper mukhya sachiv atul prasad bhi maanate hai ki chunaav ke kaaran gehun kharid main deree hui he, lekin ab isamen teji ai he
 He claimed that the government will achieve the target
 sutron kaa kahana he ki in jilon main gehun kii kharid shuru nahin karne kaa mukhya kaaran godaam main sthaan nahin hona he
 Sources claim that packs and trade boards are avoiding buying wheat
 ullekhneey he ki pehle vyapaar mandal dwaara hi yahaan gehun kii kharid kii jaati thi, lekin pehali baar sahakaarita vibhaag praathmik krishi saakh samitiyon (packs) ke madhyam se bhi is varsh gehun kii kharid kar rahaa he
 However, such packs have not been included, which are already defaulter or they are operating the PDS shop
 vibhaag ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki ab tak 1500 se zyada samitiyon kaa chayan gehun kharid ke liye kiya gaya he
 The highest number of committees have been selected in Madhubani district, while in Patna, more than 135 committees are engaged in the procurement of wheat
 sahakaarita kaa vibhaag kaa daawa he ki supaul main ab tak sabase adhik gehun kii kharid kii gai he
 Bihar Cooperative Minister Rana Randhir Singh said on the phone that a few days ago, meeting of all the officials has been directed to speed up wheat procurement
 unhone kaha ki pratidin gehun kharid kii monitering kii ja rahi he
 He claimed that as per the target by this month, wheat would be procured

 The security personnel have also been removed from their current duties
 pakadidayal ke esadio sanjay kumaar verma or thana prabharee bindaa prasad ne is sambandh main jaankaree di
 The leaders whose tickets have been cut by Akhilesh Yadav in Samajwadi Party continue to leave the party and go to Bahujan Samaj Party
 ravivaar ko lakhanu main akhilesh sarkaar main cabinet mantri rahe naarad raay ne bispi kaa daaman tham liya
 Akhilesh Yadav was removed from Narada Rai twice in his cabinet
 bispi main shaamil hone ke baad naarad raay ne kaha kiakhileshne unke saath jaisaa vyavhaar kiya vaisaa bartaav koi apane ghar ke naukaron ke saath bhi nahin karata
 Narada Rai was close to Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav

 BJP mps can get in the action mode about the assembly elections in Delhi, the responsibility of electoral command will be decided only after the elections on the CM face, the party will decide the assembly elections in Delhi are very close
 vidhansabha chunaav 2020 main 21 saal se dur bhartiya janata party (bijepi) is baar kisi bhi keemat par chunaav jeetna chaahati he
 Like the Congress, the BJP is also a victim of internal strife
 sheersh party netritv ke liye party ke kaaryakartaaon kii raay se lekar mukhyamantri ke chehre or party ke andar kii gutbaji khatm karne kii bhi chunauti he
 The BJP does not want to leave any stone unturned to win in Delhi too
 bijepi chunaav jeetne ke liye alag-alag ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 According to sources, the party is considering to field mps this time, in which the name of Vijay Goyal, MP from Rajya Sabha and senior leader of Delhi BJP is also coming out
 vijay goyal kaa rajyasabha kaarykaal agle saal khatm ho rahaa he
 At the same time, former MP from East Delhi Mahesh Giri is also being considered
 jabaki dilli bijepi ke saansadon ko lekar daavedaar shabd kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 According to the information received from the regional sources, whether there is a mutual tussle between the mps or the question of claim for the post of CM, for this, the party can ask the Delhi BJP mps to contest the assembly elections on the claim
 jo bhi saansad apane aap ko siem pad kaa daavedaar maanate hai, unako vidhansabha kaa chunaav ladane ko kaha ja saktaa he
 At present, Delhi BJP mps have not been asked to contest elections, but if they have any claim, then they too can be asked to contest the Assembly elections
 sutron ke mutabik, party ko lagata he ki aisa karne se dilli vidhansabha chunaav se pehle saansad or siem pad ko lekar aapasi khinchataan bhi kam ho jaaegi or sab milakar chunaav jeetne ke liye kaam karenge
 After winning the election, the party high command will decide who will become the CM
 chunki saansadon ko vidhansabha chunaav ladne ke liye saansad pad se istipha bhi nahin dena padegaa, kyonki 6 maheene kaa vakt miltaa he
 By the way, every parliamentary constituency has 10 assembly constituencies in which each MP has been entrusted with the responsibility of winning the party in their own constituencies
 darasal party ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki jab-jab dilli vidhansabha chunaav main siem chehre ke saath utari he party ko haar mili he or ek baar mauka bhi mila lekin bahumat nahin mil paaya, isliye bina siem chehre ke hi utarana chahie
 At the same time, party workers in Delhi BJP have suggested to contest on Modi's face, but considering the party preparations for 2024, Prime Minister Modi has to decide whether to make Prime Minister face or not
 party camel nishaan or kuch bade chehre ke saath maidan main utarana chaahati he
 The party high command will decide on who will become the chief minister after winning the election
 philhal is mudde par koi bhi kuch bhi bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 On the question asked about the mps, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari denied it and said, i am not aware of it
