big bos main is hafte siddharth shukla (sidharth Shukla) captain hai or vah bahut hi dimag ke saath captaini kar bhi rahe hai
 Although it was said on social media that he is taking a lot more opinion from Paras Chhabra, but today Siddharth Shukla will be seen playing his game
 aaj big bos house main ek sadsy ko chunaa jayega jise jail main bhejne ke liye kaha jayega
 In this way, Bigg Boss members will name Paras Chhabra and Asim Riaz
 siddharth shukla bhi paras chhabda (paras Chhabra) kaa naam lete dikh rahe hai
 a post shared by Biggbosskhabri (@biggbosskhabri) on Nov 28, 2019 at 10:36 pm PST big bos 13 (bigg Boss 13) ke fain pej par ab jaankaree aa rahi he ki paras chhabda jail jane se inkaar kar denge
 If Paras Chhabra does not agree to go to jail at any cost, then he will be sentenced in lieu of it
 sajaa ke taur par paras chhabda ko juute saaf karne honge
 Such photos are becoming viral on social media, in which Paras Chhabra is seen cleaning shoes
 haalanki aasim riyaj jail jane ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai lekin paras chhabda aisa karne se inkaar kar dete hai
 As it is, there is a lot of fierce fighting between Paras Chhabra and Shefali Jariwala, and arguing several times Paras Chhabra has also crossed its boundaries, which has also led to a tremendous reaction at home
 haalanki paras chhabda or aasim riyaj ke bich kal raat ko bhi jabardast ladaai dekhne ko mili thi, or donon kii yah jang lambii chali thi
 But later Paras Chhabra was put in silence
 mahaan samaajawaadee netaa doctor ram manohar lohia kii aaj ko 109veen jayanti manaai ja rahi he or lohia kii jayanti ke avasar par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane lekh ke jariye vipaksh ko nishaanaa banaate hue likhaa he ki jo log aaj dow
 While cheating with the principles of Lohia, tomorrow we will also cheat with the countrymen

 Lohia had a heart
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane blog kii shuruyaat main likhaa ki aaj kaa din desh ke mahaan krantikariyon ke sammaan kaa din he
 The country pays tribute to the immortal sons of Mother Bharati - Veer Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru for their supreme sacrifice

 Lohia started underground radio service while underground, so that the movement did not slow down and continued uninterrupted
 dow
 Lohia's name is mentioned in the golden letters in the history of the Goa liberation movement

 They are tricking Lohia's principles, they will also cheat the countrymen tomorrow

 Why is Lohia claiming to walk the path shown, why are they trying to humiliate him? Read my thoughts

 co / fvzjkexxsd— Chowkidar Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 23, 2019 Modi wrote that wherever the poor, the exploited and the deprived needed help, Dr
 lohia maujuud hote the
 He further said that Lohia's thoughts inspire us even today
 unhone krishi ko aadhunik banane or anndaataaon ke shashaktikaran ko lekar kaaphi kuch likhaa
 According to his ideas, NDA Government is working in the interest of farmers through Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, Krishi Irrigation Yojana, e-nam, Soil Health Card and other schemes
 vah jati vyavastha or mahilaon tathaa purushon ke bich kii asamanta ko dekhakar dukhi hote the
 He wrote, Our mantra of 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' and our track record of the last five years shows that we have achieved significant success in realizing Lohia's vision
 agar aaj ve hote to endie sarkaar ke kaaryon ko dekhakar nishchit rup se unhen garv kii anubhuti hoti
 He said that while Lohia spoke anywhere inside or outside Parliament, the Congress was always afraid of him
 congresavad kaa virohlohia ke jariye congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue pradhanmantri modi ne likhaa ki desh ke liye congress kitni ghaatak ho chuki he, ise dow
 Lohia understood very well
 1962 main unhone kaha tha, 'congress shashan main krishi ho yaa udyog yaa phir sena, kisi bhi kshetra main koi sudhaar nahin hua he
 'these words continued to be applied to the subsequent governments of the Congress also literally
 unhone kaha, 'congresavad kaa virodh dow
 Lohia had a heart
 unke prayaason kii vajah se hi 1967 ke aam chunaavon main sarvasaadhan sampann or taqatvar congress ko karaara jhatka laga tha
 Atal ji had said at that time, 'dr
 lohia kii koshishon kaa hi parinaam he ki haavda-amritsar mail se puri yatra bina kisi congress shasit rajya se gujarey kii ja sakati he!' durbhaagya kii baat he ki raajnneeti main aaj aise ghatnakram saamne aa rahe hai, jinhen dekhakar dow
 Lohia would also get upset, upset
 pradhanmantri modi ne vipakshi dalon par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki ve dal jo dow
 Not tired of describing Lohia as his ideal, he has completely abandoned his principles
 yahaan tak ki ye dal dow
 Leaving no chance to humiliate Lohia
 odisha ke varisht samaajawaadee netaa surendranath dvivedi ne kaha tha, 'dow
 Lohia was jailed by the Congress governments more than the number of times he went to jail during the British rule
 'vanshavaadi raajnneeti loktantr ke liye ghaatkaunhone kaha ki aaj usee congress ke saath tathakthith lohiavaadi partiyaan avasarwaadi mahamilavati gathbandhan banane ko baichaiyn hai
 This irony is both ridiculous and condemnable
 dow
 Lohia always considered dynastic politics as fatal to democracy
 aaj ve yah dekhakar jarur hairaan-pareshaan hote ki unke ‘anuyaayi’ ke liye apane pariwaron ke hit deshhit se upar hai
 Prime Minister Modi said that Dr
 lohia kaa maananaa tha ki jo vyakti ‘samta’, ‘samanta’ or ‘samatv bhav’ se kaary karata he, vah yogi he
 It is a pity that parties calling themselves Lohiaists have forgotten this principle
 ve ‘satta’, ‘swaarth’ or ‘shoshan’ main vishwaas karti hai
 These parties like it have mastered power grabbing, looting public wealth and exploitation
 garib, dalit, pichde or vanchit samudaay ke logon ke saath hi mahilaayein inke shashan main khud ko surakshit mahasoos nahin karatin, kyonki ye partiyaan apradhi or asaamaajik tattvon ko khuli chhot dene kaa kaam karti hai
 Opposing the three divorces, he further said, Dr
 lohia jivan ke har kshetra main purushon or mahilaon ke bich barabari ke pakshdhar rahe, lekin, vot bank kii politics main aakanth dubi partiyon kaa aacharan isse alag rahaa
 That is why the so-called Lohiaist parties opposed the NDA government's attempt to end the inhuman practice of triple talaq
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kai raajnneeti dalon par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki in partiyon ko yah spasht karnaa chahie ki inke liye dow
 Are Lohia's ideas and ideals big or vote bank politics? Today, 130 million Indians face the question that those who have given Dr
 lohia tak se vishwasghaat kiya, unase ham desh seva kii ummid kaise kar sakate hai? jaahir he, jin logon ne dow
 They have tricked Lohia's principles, they will also cheat the countrymen as usual

 'big bos 10' main se is hafte om swami ghar se baahar hue hai
 This time the common man and celebrities have been kept in a house for the show
 haalanki pehle din se apane alag pahanaave or andaaj kii vajah se 'indiavaale' om swami darshakon kii najar main chadh gaye the
 Or rather he became a celebrity
 sho main jaise-jaise inkaa naam chadha, usee ke saath khabaren aane lageen kiom swamijo khud 'big bos' ke ghar viraaje hai, ko to police baahar dhund rahi he
 Then the kind of things Om Swami was seen doing on the show, it really seemed that he should be jailed
 shuruyaat se hi the shurusho kii shuruyaat main om swami neakanksha sharmaake karactor par ungali uthaai thi
 It was known that celebrity contestant Gaurav Chopra had a crush on Akanksha Sharma
 itnaa ki baat shaadi kii uthne lagi
 When he revealed this, Baba had to say something - there are so many demerits inside it that a celebrity said to marry him, then he got the whole universe
 
 
 vije bani kii ye toplace tasviren ho rahi hai viral
 
 
 Even if a woman is separated from her husband (cricketer Yuvraj Singh's brother Zorawar Singh) after 4 months of marriage, no one was entitled to Baba to say anything about her character
 
 
 vaise shuruaati apisods main vahalopamudrako bhi dhamka chuke hai
 In recent episodes, even when Baba was given the king's chair in the task, his attitude was similar
 rajbhishek ke liye unako doodh se nahalaane vaale task main vah do mahilaon ke haath se nahaate behad khush the lekin jab lokesh ghar ke pool main rohan mehara ke saath gir gai to baba turant baat unke charitra par lag aae
 However, the way he was happy to see two contestants in bikini, we started to doubt his character
 
 
 lekin salmaan kyon nahin bole kuch'big bos 10'ke veekend vaale apisods aise to salmaan khan kii maujuudagi main 'veekend kaa waar' se prasaarit hote hai
 But this time there was no attack anywhere

 mana ki kisi contestant kii harakatein is sho ko tiarapy dilaa sakati hai lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki baaki logon kii izzat taak par rakh di jaae or dekhne waalon ko ek galat messej jaae
 In this weekend's episode, everyone expected Kiselman Khan to take Baba's class well
 lekin vah to unke saath masakhri karte najar aae
 Admittedly, Baba has predicted their marriage next year, but that does not mean that they should allow them to say anything on the show
 'big bos 10' main rahane waalon kii itani he kamai
 
 
 It may be that Baba's return is now shown that Baba has returned home from 'bigg Boss 10' house
 lekin khabar yah bhi he ki unki sho main jald vaapasi bhi ho sakati he
 It is being told that he is currently kept in a dark room in the 'big Boss' house and the rest of the house is not aware of it
 ab vah waapas aate hai yaa nahin, iskaa faisla to sho kii team karegi
 However, we have to say that in 'bigg Boss 10' people play the same game, but do not throw away the character of anyone
 or jo bhi aisa kare, salmaan kam se kam unki class jarur len

 However, after 2002, the relationship between Narendra Modi and Govardhan Zadaphia began to crack, and the crack grew into 2 pieces at a time
 jiske baad ek baar phir paanch saal pehle govardhan jhadfia bijepi ke saath jude or ab upi ke prabharee ke taur par unhen niyukt kiya gaya he
 Govardhan Zadaphia, who resigned from the BJP due to Modi in 2005, first formed the Gujarat Parivartan Party along with Mahagujarat Janata Party and then Keshubhai Patel

 This is a challenge, which we have to accept
 sawaal- upi kii raajnneeti main piem modi or siem yogi kii lokapriyata main bhi kami ai he
 Answer- As far as popularity is concerned, there is a huge difference
 vipaksh bhi maanata he desh main jo sabase zyada lokapriy netaa he to piem modi hi hai

 There is no one today compared to PM Modi
 vahiin vipaksh ke paas iskaa jawaab nahin he ki unka piem pad kaa ummidavaar koun hoga
 Question- Ram temple issue is important
 vikaas ki baat nahin hoti he, hinduvad kii baat hoti he

 This is a 450 year old issue
 yah maamla supreme court main chal rahaa he
 Question- BJP is talking about Ram temple, but Muslim vote bank is 18%
 jawaab-bahut saare muslim chaahate hai ki ve hinduon ke saath milakar desh ke vikaas kii baat karen
 Congress has taken only Muslim votes
 teen talaak ke mudde par centre sarkaar ne faisla liya

 Answer - There is resentment
 desh sabase pehle hona chahie
 There may be personal issues, but those who believe in the nation, whether they are minorities or majority, want the development of the country

 At the same time, when talking about the workfront, Shah Rukh Khan was last seen in the film Zero
 is film main shahrukh ke saath katrina caff or anoushka sharma bhi mukhya bhoomika main najar ai thim
 However, the film did not do much at the box office
 is film ke baad se bhale hi shahrukh ne kisi duusari movie kaa elaan na kiya ho, lekin unke phens ko unke apakaming project kaa aaj bhi besabri se intejaar he
 a consumer court has imposed a fine of Rs 55,000 on food delivery platform Zomato and a hotel for distributing non-vegetarian dishes in place of vegetarian dishes
 media rapat ke anusaar, upabhokta adaalat ne jomato ko 45 dinon ke bheetar shahar ke vakil shanmukh deshmukh ko jurmaane kii raashi dene kaa nirdesh diya, jinhen na keval ek baar, balki do baar maansaahaari vyanjan diya gaya tha
 He had ordered Paneer Butter Masala, but was sent to Butter Chicken
 chunki donon gravi vaale vyanjan hote hai, unhen pataa nahin chalaa or unhone use paneer samaj kar kha liya
 According to Jometto, the lawyer complained against it for defaming the company, while he had refunded their amount
 jomato ne upabhokta forum ko bataaya ki truti us hotel ke saath hui, jisane galat vyanjan kii aapurti kii, lekin forum ne ise samaan rup se doshi mana
 The hotel, however, admitted its mistake
 jomato or hotel ko seva main chook ke liye 50 hajaar rupee or maansik utpeedan ke liye shesh raashi kaa bhugtan karne ke nirdesh diya gaya he
 How terrorism factories are being run in Pakistan in the name of religious education
 ye shaq ek baar phir majboot hua he
 Raiding a madrasa in Karachi, the police freed 54 students
 andeshaa is baat kaa he ki unhen aatmghaatee hamalavar banane ke liye aatankwaad kii training dene ke liye rakhaa gaya tha
 Where claims are made to make a human being a true human being on the basis of training, the reality is different
 karachi ke zakaaria madrase ke basament main zanziiron se baandh kar rakhe gaye the 54 log
 They also had children and also young people
 kuch to behad chote bachche- 5-6 saal ke
 When the Pakistan Police raided here, the boys expressed their pain
 bacchon ko madrase ke basament main jaanwaron kii tarah rakhaa gaya tha
 No food to eat, no breath of freedom, beating heartless from above
 madrase main akhir ye saluk kyon? bacchon ke paanv main bediyaan kyon? kya inhen aatankwaadi banane ke makasad se qaid kiya gaya tha? kya inhen aatmdhaati hamalavar banane kii taiyaari thi
 Is this the handiwork of Taliban or al-qaida? The police suspect that it is one of those madrasas where poison is instilled in the minds of children in the name of religious education and jihad
 bediyon se azaad karaane ke baad police in sabhi ko thane le ai
 According to the police, there are some of these addicts who were admitted to the madrasa to improve them
 hairat kii baat ye hui ki kai bacchon ke rishtedaar, apane bachche ko saath le jane ko raji nahin the
 The reason he gave was also shocking
 ek madrase kii ye kadavi sachai zaahir hone se pakistan sarkaar kii fikr bhi dikhaai de rahi he
 These 50 boys were kept like animals in bad condition and were being tricked
 pakistan police ke saamne chunauti he ki wo un tamaam madrason ko benaqaab kare jahaan fidaain factory chalaai ja rahi he
 Because the naked truth of the country, which has been maligned as the factory of terrorism, has once again come in front of the world

 <p>vakt kaa pahiyaa hameshaa ghumta he
 The term of persecution does not last long
 ek vakt tha jab wo dusron par julm dhahaate the
 Now is the time that weeping ourselves
 ro rahe hai apni barbaadi par, apni haar par or saamne khadi apni maut par
 During the ongoing war in Mosul, as soon as ISIS militants find themselves surrounded by Iraqi forces, they suddenly start an emotional drama
 gidgidaate hai
 The streets start rolling
 phir betahasha rone lagate hai
 < / p> <p> To behead people for talking
 unhen suuli par taangane, goli maarane or zindaa jala dene aatankwaadiyon kii jab khud apni jaan par aa bani he, to bukka faad kar rone lage
 Neither the Khilafat of Baghdadi is able to stop these tears emanating from the eyes of the terrorists, neither the dream of 72 Hurras nor the dream of the Islamic State
 in aatankiyon ne kabhi khwaabon main bhi nahin sochaa hoga ki unka khaliph bagdadi unhen bich manzadaar main chhod kar gaayab ho jayega
 < / p> <p> When it came to life, the Khalifa ran away but left the cries of his horror behind
 jo aatanki zindaa he wo iraqi senaaon ke khauf main ro rahe hai
 Those who are in the occupation of the soldiers are crying for life
 kul milakar bagdadi kii sultanate main ronaa-pitnaa machaa hua he
 But the Iraqi army has been instructed not to have any mercy with these terrorists
 ek audio massej ke zarie bagdadi ne aatankwaadiyon ko uksaaya tha
 < / p> <p> Since then neither Baghdadi has any idea nor his special spoon
 aise main aatankwaadiyon ko lagane laga he ki bagdadi khud to chalaa gaya magar zamin par iraqi senaaon or aasmaan main america jangi jahaazon se ghire aatankiyon ke liye farmaan suna gaya ki jab tak maar sako maaro or jab naa maar sako to khud mar jaao
 But instead of dying, these terrorists have found an emotional way here
 ro-rokar ye aatanki islam ke duhai dekar bula rahe hai
 < / p> <p> The ISIS in its occupied areas is tricking the youth by calling for Islam
 lagaataar aise naujavaanon ke video in ilaakon main viral kiye ja rahe hai, jinhen fidaayin banaakar bagdadi is aag main jhonk chukaa he
 Terrorists are calling them martyrs and making them heroes, so that more such fidayeen can be born
 lekin mazahab ke naam par fidaayin banane kii bhi hakeekat jaan lijie
 This video has been released by the militia force supporting the Iraqi army
 < / p><p>taaki duniya in fidayinon kii hakeekat jaan sake
 They are crying out crying out that the people of Baghdadi showed them the dream of going to heaven and meeting the Huron
 duusare mazahab ke logon ke bare main bargalaaya, lekin jabaiieski hakeekat se saamana hua to ye jaan bachaakar bhaage to bagdadi ne inaki maut kaa farmaan jari kar diya
 Now when there is death even before them
 peeche bhi maut he
 So they are beating their heads and apologizing for the crimes
 < / p><p>pichley do maheenon se mosul main iraqi fuj or iesas ke darmyaan chal rahi aamane-saamne kii ladaai main ab tak iraqi fuj 2 hazaar se zyaada aatankwaadiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar chuki he
 This is the reason that the remaining terrorists are freshly battered and now they themselves see their death
 haalanki ab bhi is shahar main kareeb paanch hazaar aatankwaadi chupe hue hai

 The Nawab died in 1960 but before that his elder daughter Abida Sultan left India and moved to Pakistan in 1951-52

 In his petition, Saif has made the principal secretary of the Union Home Ministry, the Enemy Property Office and the revenue department of Madhya Pradesh a party

 According to the Enemy Property Act, the government takes control of the property of a person living in an enemy country like Pakistan and China, and the government also has the right to maintain and sell the property

 And on this occasion, said that the dream of the Prime Minister is that these villages should be made such that it should have all the amenities that are in the city
 iskaa matlab ye nahin ki duusare gaanv na badhen, unhen bhi prerana milegi ki ham bhi aise bane, bharat ke duusare gaanv bhi isse prerana lenge

 or is maukey par kaha ki pradhanmantri ji kaa sapana he kaha ki ye gaanv aise bane ki isamen wo sab sukh suvidhaayen ho jo shahar main hai
 This does not mean that other villages do not grow, they too will be inspired to become like this, other villages of India will also take inspiration from this

 i live in mubai and working am a good actor looking fr good parts to playa post shared by Neena Gupta (@neena_gupta) on Jul 27, 2017 at 10:11pm pdtjust the other day i was telling someone 
 
 how i am never afraid / shy to ask for work
 Its obviously genetic
 My mother put up this post on her instagram today
 i mean, my 62yr old national award winning mother
 She told me i must always work 
 
 no matter what 
 
 it keeps you from getting old
 
 
 she told me they don't write for women her age anymore
 
 
 i don't think anyone can replicate what she did for TV anymore
 
 she complains that she can't do PR 
 
 but says 'I do good work,that's my PR'
 
 time and again we've spoken about how whatever she asks for 
 
 
 in due time, she gets
 
 
 But that's the magic of a pure heart
 The universe just can't refuse you
 
 
 the only advice i have the guts to give her is
 
 don't work with anyone who won't respect you ,at this age , that's the bare minimum & it's a strange strange industry she's in
 
 
 the advice she gives me in return is
 
 'whatever you do, free ka PR mat khaana, your only someone's kid / wife / niece / sister for this long
 Prove yourself

 Another reveal on Asaram
 is baar baba ke saath naam judaa he farji muthbhed ke aarope main jail main band purv ipies diji vanjaaraa kaa
 It is being told that whatever happened to the women in the ashram was supported by Vanzara
 ek dharm kaa chola odh kar ladakiyon ke saath jor-jyaadati karne kaa mulgim, to doosraa police kii vardi main farji encounter kar logon ko maut kii neend sulaane kaa aaropee
 Incidentally, both Gujarat and both are under the law of law
 aap puuchhenge bhala asaram baapu ke saath gujarat ke is daagi police officer yani diji vanjaaraa kaa kya rishta ho saktaa he? lekin jab aap parde ke peeche in donon kii asli chemistry se waakif honge, to aapako khaaki vardi or safed chole kii aad main gunahon ke ganthjod kii wo kahani pataa chalegi, jise jaanakar hairaan ho jaaenge
 Assuming a woman who has fallen victim to Asaram's nefarious intentions, not only did Asaram often persecute the girls and women of the ashram, but also DG Vanzara, a Gujarat police officer, was fully supported in his every right and wrong
 or to or vanjaaraa or asaram kai baar mahilaon kii hifaazat ke bahaane se hi asaram ke mahila ashram main der raat ko aa dhamakate the
 Once, in the presence of this woman, Vanzara along with Asaram had reached the Mahila Ashram at 2 pm
 
 It is alleged that this was the reason that when someone tried to open his mouth against Asaram, he used to have such a fight, it would be difficult for him to survive
 or agar isi marpet main kisi kii maut ho jaati, to asaram vanjaaraa ke saath mil kar us maamle ko nipta dete
 This woman, who has accused Vanzara of this serious charge, says that this is the reason why she no longer has any objection to the Gujarat Police
 amrit prajapati kaa khulaasaaye to rahi asaram kii shikaar hui ek mahila kii baat, asaram ke hi ashram main unke nijee vaidya ke taur par kaam kar chuke amrit prajapati bhi asaram or vanjaaraa ke rishton kii gavaahi dete hai
 He says that Vanzara often visited Asaram and that in 2008, the Gujarat police covered up the mysterious death of two children in the ashram
 jaahir he, in aaropon se to yahi sabit hota he ki asaram gujarat main police afasaron ke saath milakar jurm kaa wo sindicket taiyaar kar chuke the, jiske khilaaf munh kholana bhi kisi ke liye mushkil hota
 But now because of the courage of a girl, the whole truth has been revealed
 baap-bete kaa paakhand, baap bete kaa kalank, baap bete kii sharmnaak harakatein to ab aam ho chukin
 But if the confinement of video and MMS captured in a mobile phone became common, then i do not know what the fate of the father and son would be
 mohit bhojawaani kaa mobile kholegaa rajmohit bhojawaani ke paas narayan sai kii kalank kii kutiyaa kaa ek-ek raaj he
 Police are adding links to the sins of Asaram and Family
 or isi kadi main police ke haath laga he bhojawaani kaa wo mobile phone jo baap-bete ke liye kisi bam se nahin he
 Actually, the police has found the Bhojira of blue films and pornographic MMS from Bhojwani's mobile phone, seeing that the uniforms of the people also wandered
 ab sawaal ye he ki ek aadhyatmik guru yani narayan sai kaa daayan haath maane janevaale bhojawaani ke mobile phone main itane ashleel clips ke hone kaa matlab kya ho saktaa he? zaahir he, ek mobile phone main itane ashleel clips rakhane kaa makasad sirf or sirf mouj-masti to katai nahin ho saktaa
 
 or bas, isi baat ne police ko bhojawaani se in clips se judaa ek-ek sach jaanane par majaboor kar diya he
 Now the police wants to know whether Bhojwani had saved these clips on his mobile at the behest of Narayan Sai
 kahin in clips main narayan sai or asaram ke ashramon main rahanevaali ladakiyon ke clips bhi to shaamil nahin hai, jinaki madad se kisi ko blackmel karne kii koshish kii ja rahi ho
 Obviously, if anyone can answer these questions to the police, then only Bhojwani and Narayan Sai are there
 narayan to philhal police kii giraft main nahin hai, lekin bhojawaani ko remand par lekar police usase yahi puch rahi he
 The police suspect Bhojwani more because Narayan Sai and Bhojwani were coming to the location in Jaipur before an FIR was filed against Narayan Sai, while Narayan Sai's mobile phone was switched off after the rape case was registered
 aise main ab bhojawaani ke pakade jane ke saath hi police ko narayan sai kaa suraag milane kii bhi ummid jaagi he
 Exactly 1 month and 13 days later, Asaram came out of the Jodhpur jail, even in the condition that he would not have thought even in dreams
 asaram ne kabhi khwaabon main bhi ye nahin sochaa hoga ki jodhpur se jail se baahar nikalne par unhen is haalat main apane home-toun ahmedabad ke liye ravaanaa hona hoga
 From Ahmedabad to Jaipur and Jodhpur to Delhi, Asaram's disciples are questioning the FIR lodged against Asaram not only in the form of separate papers, but also attacking the police and media
 in par yakeen karen to asaram ke khilaaf bolanewaala har shaks yaa to kisi sajeesh kaa shikaar he yaa phir khud sajeesh kaa hissaa he
 One such pamphlet being distributed in Delhi has said that if Asaram had tried to do too much with the girl, then why did the girl delay in filing an FIR? Along with this it is also said that those who were being harmed by the teachings of Asaram, they made this whole conspiracy against Asaram

 The result of the by-election will work to create an atmosphere for 2019, hence both the SP and BJP parties have fielded Patel candidates from here, keeping caste equations
 congress ne yahaan brahman card khelaa he, vahiin basapa ne upachunaav na ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 The dominance of Patel voters is the most telling that in the Phulpur parliamentary constituency, OBC voters are the highest and among them also the highest number of Patel voters
 aise main raajnneetik dalon ne patel votaron ko apane kheme main laane kii kavayad kii he
 Both SP and BJP have made political battle interesting by playing bets on Patel candidate

 The SP has fielded Nagendra Patel from this seat, while the BJP has played bets on Kaushalendra Patel by bringing him from 150 kilometers away
 iske chalate yahaan muqabla kshetreey banaam bahari kaa bhi ban rahaa he
 The Congress has also hit the Brahmin face Manish Mishra in view of the ethnic arithmetic of Phulpur in the BJP troubled by the congress-sp siege

 The atmosphere of the BJP has changed a lot
 yogi ke ek saal ke kaarykaal ko dekha jaae to unke paas ginane ko kuch khaas uplabdhiyaan bhi nahin hai

 Almost every source of water, wells, rivers and ponds has dried up
 logon kii pyaas bujhane ke liye sarkaar har roj 800 tanker pani bid bhejti he
 But is that water reaching the needy people? Aajtak's special investigative team reached Beed to investigate this
 hamane vahaan kaa jo sach dekha, usase aapaki ankhen bhi fatty rah jaaengi
 The responsibility of delivering water in Beed district was on the shoulders of Municipal Council Chairman Gurkhade, in front of our intelligence team
 hamaari team ne use bataaya tha ki ham log yahaan ek industry lagaana chaahate hai, jiske liye hamen har roj do se teen tanker pani kii jarurat padegi
 The chairman immediately agreed to sell his faith in lieu of money

 This is the situation in Beed area of maharashtra, which is the worst crisis after Latur
 jahaan takreeban 800 pani ke tanker har roj supplai kiye ja rahe hai
 These tankers depart, for the rate of thirst, but the water merchants deal with their thirst on the way
 sabhapati kii baton se ham hairaan the
 In the first meeting, he made a deal to give three tankers of water at the rate of Rs 2000 per tanker without hesitation
 wo bhi tab tak jab tak ki hamen jarurat hogi
 The Chairman will be found
 
 
 jahaan daalana he vahaan daal degaa

 You just mean water

 Gopal Gurkhade also assured us that no one would be able to do any kind of Dadagiri with us in his area
 
 Chairman - You have to bore, bore

 Any problem
 
 
 tumhaara nahin problem
 
 
 He will be ours

 We will join you
 thode se paison ke liye bid ke pyaase logon ke pani kaa sauda karne ke saath-saath sabhapati mahoday hamaari har aadchan dur karne ke liye taiyaar the
 But, now we wanted to go to the depths of this conspiracy, so we decided to find the pulse of those people who had the responsibility of supplying water in the villages
 ham panchayat adhikari ke sahaayak lakshmikant or anulekhak gayasuddin juberi ke paas pahunche
 We too told the same story to both of them who had told Gopal Gurkhade, Chairman of Nagar Palika Parishad
 hairaani dekhie
 Both of them also reached our hotel to deal with us
 reporter-to usamen bhai sahab kyonki phir lagaataar flo main construction chalegaa hamaara
 
 
 We need 2-3 tankers of water daily
 juberi-12 hajaar litre ke
 Reporter - 12 thousand liters
 lakshmikant-12*3=36 hajaar litre
 Zuberi - slightly less
 reporter-nahin nahin thodaa kam zyada bhi hoga to
 
 
 It is only a matter of 1-1 liter of measurement
 juberi-zyada denge kam to nahin denge
 Reporter - Okay
 
 
 aap ke hi bharose hai phir
 
 
 The biggest problem is water
 
 
 construction
 However, along with the water deal, Laxmikant and Zuberi also cited the risk, but they also gave the idea of how to deal with it themselves
 lakshmikant-tumhaara naam bada bol ke aayaa main
 
 
 There is a lot of risk here too
 
 
 idhar kaisaa he
 Zuberi - very fire touch sir
 
 
 firing
 
 
 Reporter - So how will brother 
 
 kuch pakad-vakad main to nahin aayega
 Laxmikant - no no no
 
 
 ye raat ko pani aayegaa giraane
 Reporter - Okay
 
 
 haa nite main lebar to rahegaa hi vahaan
 Laxmikant - what will happen is this government tanker will come but its plate will not fit
 wo apana daal ke nikal jaayegaa puraa raat ko
 
 
 Will not happen in the day
 reporter-saat baje ke baad
 
 
 After seven o'clock in the evening
 
 
 aath baje wo jab marji aayaa vahaan lebar milegaa
 In talks, a deal was given to give two tankers of 12000 liters per day at the rate of Rs
 2000 per tanker
 eemaandaaree se pani pahunchane kii jimmedaari bhi donon ne le lee or iske liye peshgi ke taur par lakshmikant ne hamase do hajaar rupee advance bhi le liya

 lakshmikant-daahine haath se
 Reporter-sorry-saree

 Laxmikant refused to take the money with his left hand so that the omen was not damaged
 lekin pani ke in saudagaron ne un pyaase logon kii chintaa nahin kii, jinke pine ke pani kaa sauda inhone chand paison ke liye hamase kar liya tha

 Nowadays whenever the government makes an appointment, there is a debate about merit and middle-aged
 Mediocrity kaa hindi main koi sateek shabd nahin he
 So i have coined a new term to enter into this debate - middleness
 mideocrity ke badale ausat kaa istamaal thik nahin he
 i would like to use medium for the midiocar
 main maanata hum ki samaaj ke samarthan se bane system main yogya or madhyogy donon hone chahie
 Middle people also have to consume
 yogya log dhoop main utarkar party ke liye poster binar nahin lagaate
 Shouldn't he get a chance in his party's government? Has there been a new political culture in the country where only being qualified is acceptable
 mujhe to aisa nahin lagata
 Neither seen in Delhi nor in the states
 bharat main yogya logon kaa record bhi utana hi karaab he jitna madhyogy logon kaa koi record hi nahin hona
 Nowadays whenever there is a discussion of merit, i am filled with sympathy for all those people who despite their low capacity are carrying on life in the same way that the worthy person lives with a little more royalty and performance
 kisi bhi desh main avasaron kii ghor kami yogyata ko krur banaati he
 It is related to resource
 kai logon ne bihar se lekar kashmir tak garib bacchon ko prashikshan dekar ai ai tii main pravesh karaayaa he
 This means that merit is not just related to natural talent
 sansadhano se bhi hota he
 The son of a vegetable farmer from Bihar was talented but without Anand's coaching he would not have been able to become an IIT
 merit kaa tark navaudaravaadi arthvyavastha ke daur kaa ahamkaari tark he
 The rich and some successful people feel that their gains are just from merit
 vah yah nahin bataate ki unki kamyaabi main essar tepe ke kathith ujaagaron kaa bhi role he jo unhen netaa, naukarshah or nyaaypalika ke gathjod se kaamyaab banaata he
 Even today, most of the industrialists are mines
 garib ko yah kaha ja rahaa he ki tumhaare paas merit nahin he isliye hasil nahin kar sake
 It is also true that in this economy, many poor and middle people have also developed and achieved success over time
 jugad,sifaarishon or by chance mili maukey se bhi kai baar logon ne pratibha ke nae maanak qaayam kiye hai
 Our education and family system is the preserve of middle-aged
 isliye madhyogy logon se nafrat mat kijiye
 He does not want anything more than life
 kisi kii jugad se kahin lag janaa chaahate hai or kaali patalun or check shart daal dahez kii car se shimla ghoomane kii tamanna se sthaneey paryaton ko badhaava dete rahete hai
 There are also many levels of qualifications
 koi yogya hote hue bhi afasar nahin ban paata or koi madhyogy hote hue bhi chairman ban jaataa he
 The two later perform the same
 madhyogy log arthvyavastha or samaaj kii buniyaad hai
 Many of these people are full of opportunities
 hamaari shiksha vyavastha gunvatttavihin he
 The teacher is reinstated on contract and is conducting a census instead of class
 karaab shiksha vyavastha ke shikaar madhyogy log har jagah se haar kar kachhariyon main doum darje kii vakaalat se lekar tahseelon main lut paat kaa rasta khoj kar samaaj main dhan kaa samaan vitaran kar rahe hai
 Intermittency is a product of the system
 iskaa hisaab hona chahie
 When choosing pms, cms, ministers, mlas, mps, Nigamaghyakshas and palika-panchayat heads, we do not talk of merit, then why is there so much uproar over the appointment of two or three people? Do we see whether we are eligible when choosing MLA or MP
 aaj koun sa netaa he jo yogyata ko badhaava de rahaa he
 mps are being used for campaigning while they should be asked what their involvement was in the formulation of policies
 ham tab kyon nahin bolte ki saansad kaa kaam kya party adhyaksh ke twit ko ritvit karnaa he yaa nitiyaan bananaa he
 During the election day, someone comes from somewhere, a doctor, engineer and advocate, joins a party and becomes an MP
 inamen se zyaadaatar vah hote hai jo chunaav kaa karcha uthaa sakate hai
 Do we then make a dent in this downfall of politics? Do we then raise the question of merit? Look at the condition of spokespersons of each party
 unase zyaada yogya unke saansad honge lekin aapako tivi par kitne dalon ke saansad bahes karte dikhte hai
 very less 
 do chaar ko chhod isliye nahin dikhte ki unki pahchaan ban gai to netritv kii madhyogyata ujagar ho jaaegi
 The role of institutions in our country is over
 centre hi nahin rajyon kii sansthaaon kaa yahi haal he
 Their professional work did not work
 janata ke paise se ye sansthaaen isliye khadi kii jaati hai taaki kisi raajnneetik nishthavan ko khapaaya ja sake
 If some organizations become exceptions then this is their own fate
 koi bhi sanstha kisi ke dwaara chalaai ja sakati he
 It is also the job of a political party to arrange such people
 kya yah sahi nahin he ki kai log kuch paane kii laalasaa main apni peshewar saakh raajnneetik dalon ko transafar karte hai
 Why should they not get benefits in return? Are there not people in every party who have nothing to do with ideology? In the longing for the post, they are sometimes Congressmen and sometimes BJP
 kya purvavarti sarkaron main aise logon ko laabh nahin mila karata tha? Fitoor Lutyens of merit is born by the Kuchakra of Delhi
 kuch log yogyata kaa jhansa dekar saalon se cametiyon main dame hai
 Is a former Cabinet Secretary
 kai baar lagata he ki unke ritair hone ke baad koi doosraa prashasnic anubhavon vaala cabinet sachiv ritair hi nahin hua he
 Even today he is making reports
 aise hi kuch purv police pramukh or kamishnar hai jinaki media or sarkari aayogon main upasthiti dekhakar lagata he ki baaki log in mahakamon se bina anubhav ke hi ritair hue hai
 Many times there is not even equal distribution of merit in our country
 zaruri he ki madhyogy or yogya logon kaa samaan vitaran ho
 Where will the middle aged poor go? Will he just shout slogans? isliye madhyogy log chintaa na karen
 i stand by them
 main bharat kaa hi nahin duniya kaa akelaa pro-madhyogyatavaadi( pro-mediocrity) patrkaar hum
 The record of all the former professors who are praising the qualifications these days has also been there to recruit middle-class people
 aaj bhi aisi bhartiyon ho rahi hai
 When policies have to be made from outside, then there is no need to do qualification for indigenous exposure
 sabko 'edjust' hone kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie
 The comments isliye madhyogy bilkul sharminda na hon, main hum na

 First of all, do work in serial and after that, in rallies, be a Bhima Arjun and also roam in the sun

 Being a professional is nothing in this country
 bahut kam peshewar hue hai jo dusron ko aage badhaate rahete hai 
 Pahlaj Nihalani was not a good professional but someone took him forward
 har koi anuraag kashyap sa nahin hota jo nae nae pratibhashali nirdeshkon ko mauka dete hai
 But if you rely on the exception, then you will remain composted at the root
 koi doosraa ug aayega
 The institutions of our country have a great responsibility to carry out the work
 aajkal ham aise gam manaa rahe hai jaise koi yogya aa jaataa to sansthaaon ko swatantra charitra pradaan kar detaa
 When institutions have to be cast in the political complexion of the government, then no matter what it comes to
 madhyogyata amar rahe
 Amen
 bharat main yogya logon kaa record bhi utana hi karaab he jitna madhyogy logon kaa koi record hi nahin hona
 Nowadays whenever there is a discussion of merit, i am filled with sympathy for all those people who despite their low capacity are carrying on life in the same way that the worthy person lives with a little more royalty and performance
 kisi bhi desh main avasaron kii ghor kami yogyata ko krur banaati he
 It is related to resource
 kai logon ne bihar se lekar kashmir tak garib bacchon ko prashikshan dekar ai ai tii main pravesh karaayaa he
 This means that merit is not just related to natural talent
 sansadhano se bhi hota he
 The son of a vegetable farmer from Bihar was talented but without Anand's coaching he would not have been able to become an IIT
 merit kaa tark navaudaravaadi arthvyavastha ke daur kaa ahamkaari tark he
 The rich and some successful people feel that their gains are just from merit
 vah yah nahin bataate ki unki kamyaabi main essar tepe ke kathith ujaagaron kaa bhi role he jo unhen netaa, naukarshah or nyaaypalika ke gathjod se kaamyaab banaata he
 Even today, most of the industrialists are mines
 garib ko yah kaha ja rahaa he ki tumhaare paas merit nahin he isliye hasil nahin kar sake
 It is also true that in this economy, many poor and middle people have also developed and achieved success over time
 jugad,sifaarishon or by chance mili maukey se bhi kai baar logon ne pratibha ke nae maanak qaayam kiye hai
 Our education and family system is the preserve of middle-aged
 isliye madhyogy logon se nafrat mat kijiye
 He does not want anything more than life
 kisi kii jugad se kahin lag janaa chaahate hai or kaali patalun or check shart daal dahez kii car se shimla ghoomane kii tamanna se sthaneey paryaton ko badhaava dete rahete hai
 There are also many levels of qualifications
 koi yogya hote hue bhi afasar nahin ban paata or koi madhyogy hote hue bhi chairman ban jaataa he
 The two later perform the same
 madhyogy log arthvyavastha or samaaj kii buniyaad hai
 Many of these people are full of opportunities
 hamaari shiksha vyavastha gunvatttavihin he
 The teacher is reinstated on contract and is conducting a census instead of class
 karaab shiksha vyavastha ke shikaar madhyogy log har jagah se haar kar kachhariyon main doum darje kii vakaalat se lekar tahseelon main lut paat kaa rasta khoj kar samaaj main dhan kaa samaan vitaran kar rahe hai
 Intermittency is a product of the system
 iskaa hisaab hona chahie
 When choosing pms, cms, ministers, mlas, mps, Nigamaghyakshas and palika-panchayat heads, we do not talk of merit, then why is there so much uproar over the appointment of two or three people? Do we see whether we are eligible when choosing MLA or MP
 aaj koun sa netaa he jo yogyata ko badhaava de rahaa he
 mps are being used for campaigning while they should be asked what their involvement was in the formulation of policies
 ham tab kyon nahin bolte ki saansad kaa kaam kya party adhyaksh ke twit ko ritvit karnaa he yaa nitiyaan bananaa he
 During the election day, someone comes from somewhere, a doctor, engineer and advocate, joins a party and becomes an MP
 inamen se zyaadaatar vah hote hai jo chunaav kaa karcha uthaa sakate hai
 Do we then make a dent in this downfall of politics? Do we then raise the question of merit? Look at the condition of spokespersons of each party
 unase zyaada yogya unke saansad honge lekin aapako tivi par kitne dalon ke saansad bahes karte dikhte hai
 very less 
 do chaar ko chhod isliye nahin dikhte ki unki pahchaan ban gai to netritv kii madhyogyata ujagar ho jaaegi
 The role of institutions in our country is over
this is the condition of the institutions of the centre hi nahin rajyon kii sansthaaon kaa yahi haal he
 Their professional work did not work
 janata ke paise se ye sansthaaen isliye khadi kii jaati hai taaki kisi raajnneetik nishthavan ko khapaaya ja sake
 If some organizations become exceptions then this is their own fate
 koi bhi sanstha kisi ke dwaara chalaai ja sakati he
 It is also the job of a political party to arrange such people
 kya yah sahi nahin he ki kai log kuch paane kii laalasaa main apni peshewar saakh raajnneetik dalon ko transafar karte hai
 Why should they not get benefits in return? Are there not people in every party who have nothing to do with ideology? In the longing for the post, they are sometimes Congressmen and sometimes BJP
 kya purvavarti sarkaron main aise logon ko laabh nahin mila karata tha? Fitoor Lutyens of merit is born by the Kuchakra of Delhi
 kuch log yogyata kaa jhansa dekar saalon se cametiyon main dame hai
 Is a former Cabinet Secretary
 kai baar lagata he ki unke ritair hone ke baad koi doosraa prashasnic anubhavon vaala cabinet sachiv ritair hi nahin hua he
 Even today he is making reports
 aise hi kuch purv police pramukh or kamishnar hai jinaki media or sarkari aayogon main upasthiti dekhakar lagata he ki baaki log in mahakamon se bina anubhav ke hi ritair hue hai
 Many times there is not even equal distribution of merit in our country
 zaruri he ki madhyogy or yogya logon kaa samaan vitaran ho
 Where will the middle aged poor go? Will he just shout slogans? isliye madhyogy log chintaa na karen
 i stand by them
 main bharat kaa hi nahin duniya kaa akelaa pro-madhyogyatavaadi( pro-mediocrity) patrkaar hum
 The record of all the former professors who are praising the qualifications these days has also been there to recruit middle-class people
 aaj bhi aisi bhartiyon ho rahi hai
 When policies have to be made from outside, then there is no need to do qualification for indigenous exposure
 sabko 'edjust' hone kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie

 jab piem, siem, mantri, vidhayak, saansad, nigamaghyaksh or palika-panchaitadhyakshon ko chunate samay ham yogyata kii baat nahin karte to do teen logon kii niyukti ko lekar itnaa hangaamaa kyon karte hai ? kya ham vidhayak yaa saansad chunate samay dekhte hai ki yogya he yaa nahin
 Which leader is promoting merit today
 saansadon ko prachaar ke kaam main lagaaya ja rahaa he jabaki unase yah poocha janaa chahie ki nitiyon ke nirmaan main unki kya bhagidaari rahi
 Why don't we then say whether the job of the MP is to retweet the party president's tweet or make policies
 chunaav ke dinon main koi kahin se doctor, ejeeniyar or vakaalat karata hua aata he, kisi party main shaamil hota he or saansad ban jaataa he
 Most of these are those who can afford the election
 kya tab ham raajnneeti ke is patan par hallaa karte hai? kya tab ham yogyata kaa sawaal uthaate hai? har dal ke pravaktaaon kii haalat dekhiye
 Their mps will be more qualified than them, but you see how many parties mps argue on TV
 bahut kam 
 Except two or four do not show that if their identity is made, then the middle leadership of the leadership will be revealed
 hamaare desh main sansthaaon kii bhoomika samaapt ho chuki he
 This is the condition of the institutions of the states, not just the center
 inkaa peshewar kaam nahin rahaa
 These institutions are created with public money so that any political allegiance can be consumed
 kuch sansthaaen apwaad ke taur ban gai to ye unki apni kismat he
 Any organization can be run by anyone
 aise logon kaa intazaam karnaa bhi raajnneetik dal kaa kaam hota he
 Is it not right that many people transfer their professional credentials to political parties in the desire to get something
 iske badale main unhen laabh kyon na milen? kya har dal main aise log nahin bhare hai jinka vichaardhaara se koi lenaa dena nahin he? pad kii laalasaa main hi to ve kabhi congressi kabhi bhaajapai hote rahete hai
 Did not such people get benefits in earlier governments? yogyata kaa fitoor lutian dilli ke kuchakr ne paidaa kiya he
 Some people have been in the committees for years, by pretending to have merit
 ek purv cabinet sachiv hai
 At times, it seems that after his retirement, the cabinet secretary with no other administrative experience has retired
 aaj bhi vah report bana rahe hai
 There are some former police chiefs and commissioners whose presence in the media and government commissions makes it seem that the rest have retired without experience
 kai baar hamaare desh main yogyata kaa bhi samaan vitaran nahin hota he
 It is important that there is equal distribution of middle and qualified people
 madhyogy bechaara kahaan jayega? kya wo sirf naare lagayegaa ? Therefore, middle people should not worry
 main unke saath khadaa hoon
 i am the only pro-mediocrity journalist not only of India but also of the world
 jo purv professor in dinon yogyata kii duhai de rahe hai un sabakaa record bhi madhyogy logon kii bhartee karaane kaa hi rahaa he
 Even today such recruitments are taking place
 jab nitiyaan baahar se hi banakar aani he to desi chhaunk lagane ke liye yogyata yogyata karne kii koi zarurat nahin he
 Everyone should get the right to be 'adjusted'
 tippaniyan Therefore, the middle man should not be ashamed at all, i am neither
 jo bhi pad kaa prastaav aaye le lijiye
 Rather, when industrialists value the price of their support, why not sportsmen and filmmakers
 ek to serial main bhi kaam karo or uske baad reliyon main bhim arjuna banakar dhoop main ghoomte bhi raho
 Then, if a government is formed, be excluded so that you are not qualified
 ghor kalyug he
 Narayan Narayan
 is desh main peshewar hona kuch nahin hota he
 There have been very few professionals who keep advancing others
 pehlaaj nihlani achche peshewar nahin the lekin kisi ne unhen aage to badhaayaa
 Not everyone is like Anurag Kashyap who gives a chance to fresh new talented directors
 lekin apwaad ke bharose rahenge to jad main khaad banakar rah jaayenge
 Someone else will grow
 hamaare desh kii sansthaaon kii ek badi zimmedaari he ki vah khapaane kaa kaam karen
 Nowadays we are celebrating such sorrow as if someone were able to come, he would have given independent character to the institutions
 jab sansthaaon ko sarkaar ke raajnneetik rang main hi dhalanaa he to koi bhi aae isse kya fark padataa he
 Immortality remains immortal
 amin
 During the election day, someone comes from somewhere, a doctor, engineer and advocate, joins a party and becomes an MP
 inamen se zyaadaatar vah hote hai jo chunaav kaa karcha uthaa sakate hai
 Do we then make a dent in this downfall of politics? Do we then raise the question of merit? Look at the condition of spokespersons of each party
 unase zyaada yogya unke saansad honge lekin aapako tivi par kitne dalon ke saansad bahes karte dikhte hai
 very less 
 do chaar ko chhod isliye nahin dikhte ki unki pahchaan ban gai to netritv kii madhyogyata ujagar ho jaaegi
 The role of institutions in our country is over
 centre hi nahin rajyon kii sansthaaon kaa yahi haal he
 Their professional work did not work
 janata ke paise se ye sansthaaen isliye khadi kii jaati hai taaki kisi raajnneetik nishthavan ko khapaaya ja sake
 If some organizations become exceptions then this is their own fate
 koi bhi sanstha kisi ke dwaara chalaai ja sakati he
 It is also the job of a political party to arrange such people
 kya yah sahi nahin he ki kai log kuch paane kii laalasaa main apni peshewar saakh raajnneetik dalon ko transafar karte hai
 Why should they not get benefits in return? Are there not people in every party who have nothing to do with ideology? In the longing for the post, they are sometimes Congressmen and sometimes BJP
 kya purvavarti sarkaron main aise logon ko laabh nahin mila karata tha? Fitoor Lutyens of merit is born by the Kuchakra of Delhi
 kuch log yogyata kaa jhansa dekar saalon se cametiyon main dame hai
 Is a former Cabinet Secretary
 kai baar lagata he ki unke ritair hone ke baad koi doosraa prashasnic anubhavon vaala cabinet sachiv ritair hi nahin hua he
 Even today he is making reports
 aise hi kuch purv police pramukh or kamishnar hai jinaki media or sarkari aayogon main upasthiti dekhakar lagata he ki baaki log in mahakamon se bina anubhav ke hi ritair hue hai
 Many times there is not even equal distribution of merit in our country
 zaruri he ki madhyogy or yogya logon kaa samaan vitaran ho
 Where will the middle aged poor go? Will he just shout slogans? isliye madhyogy log chintaa na karen
 i stand by them
 main bharat kaa hi nahin duniya kaa akelaa pro-madhyogyatavaadi( pro-mediocrity) patrkaar hum
 The record of all the former professors who are praising the qualifications these days has also been there to recruit middle-class people
 aaj bhi aisi bhartiyon ho rahi hai
 When policies have to be made from outside, then there is no need to do qualification for indigenous exposure
 sabko 'edjust' hone kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie
 The comments isliye madhyogy bilkul sharminda na hon, main hum na
 Take the proposal of whatever position
 balki jab udyogpati apane samarthan kii qeemat vasuulate hai to khilaadi or filmkaar kyon na vasulein
 First of all, do work in serial and after that, in rallies, be a Bhima Arjun and also roam in the sun
 phir sarkaar ban jaae to is liye baahar kar diye jaao ki aap yogya nahin he
 It is a dark age
 narayan narayan
 Being a professional is nothing in this country
 bahut kam peshewar hue hai jo dusron ko aage badhaate rahete hai 
 Pahlaj Nihalani was not a good professional but someone took him forward
 har koi anuraag kashyap sa nahin hota jo nae nae pratibhashali nirdeshkon ko mauka dete hai
 But if you rely on the exception, then you will remain composted at the root
 koi doosraa ug aayega
 The institutions of our country have a great responsibility to carry out the work
 aajkal ham aise gam manaa rahe hai jaise koi yogya aa jaataa to sansthaaon ko swatantra charitra pradaan kar detaa
 When institutions have to be cast in the political complexion of the government, then no matter what it comes to
 madhyogyata amar rahe
 Amen
 hamaare desh main sansthaaon kii bhoomika samaapt ho chuki he
 This is the condition of the institutions of the states, not just the center
 inkaa peshewar kaam nahin rahaa
 These institutions are created with public money so that any political allegiance can be consumed
 kuch sansthaaen apwaad ke taur ban gai to ye unki apni kismat he
 Any organization can be run by anyone
 aise logon kaa intazaam karnaa bhi raajnneetik dal kaa kaam hota he
 Is it not right that many people transfer their professional credentials to political parties in the desire to get something
 iske badale main unhen laabh kyon na milen? kya har dal main aise log nahin bhare hai jinka vichaardhaara se koi lenaa dena nahin he? pad kii laalasaa main hi to ve kabhi congressi kabhi bhaajapai hote rahete hai
 Did not such people get benefits in earlier governments? yogyata kaa fitoor lutian dilli ke kuchakr ne paidaa kiya he
 Some people have been in the committees for years, by pretending to have merit
 ek purv cabinet sachiv hai
 At times, it seems that after his retirement, the cabinet secretary with no other administrative experience has retired
 aaj bhi vah report bana rahe hai
 There are some former police chiefs and commissioners whose presence in the media and government commissions makes it seem that the rest have retired without experience
 kai baar hamaare desh main yogyata kaa bhi samaan vitaran nahin hota he
 It is important that there is equal distribution of middle and qualified people
 madhyogy bechaara kahaan jayega? kya wo sirf naare lagayegaa ? Therefore, middle people should not worry
 main unke saath khadaa hoon
 i am the only pro-mediocrity journalist not only of India but also of the world
 jo purv professor in dinon yogyata kii duhai de rahe hai un sabakaa record bhi madhyogy logon kii bhartee karaane kaa hi rahaa he
 Even today such recruitments are taking place
 jab nitiyaan baahar se hi banakar aani he to desi chhaunk lagane ke liye yogyata yogyata karne kii koi zarurat nahin he
 Everyone should get the right to be 'adjusted'
 tippaniyan Therefore, the middle man should not be ashamed at all, i am neither
 jo bhi pad kaa prastaav aaye le lijiye
 Rather, when industrialists value the price of their support, why not sportsmen and filmmakers
 ek to serial main bhi kaam karo or uske baad reliyon main bhim arjuna banakar dhoop main ghoomte bhi raho
 Then, if a government is formed, be excluded so that you are not qualified
 ghor kalyug he
 Narayan Narayan
 is desh main peshewar hona kuch nahin hota he
 There have been very few professionals who keep advancing others
 pehlaaj nihlani achche peshewar nahin the lekin kisi ne unhen aage to badhaayaa
 Not everyone is like Anurag Kashyap who gives a chance to fresh new talented directors
 lekin apwaad ke bharose rahenge to jad main khaad banakar rah jaayenge
 Someone else will grow
 hamaare desh kii sansthaaon kii ek badi zimmedaari he ki vah khapaane kaa kaam karen
 Nowadays we are celebrating such sorrow as if someone were able to come, he would have given independent character to the institutions
 jab sansthaaon ko sarkaar ke raajnneetik rang main hi dhalanaa he to koi bhi aae isse kya fark padataa he
 Immortality remains immortal

 unhone kaha, jis tarah se bharat kii kahani 26 may, 2014 ko nahin shuru hui thi usee tareeke se jandhan yojana ke jariye vittiya samaveshan bhi shuru nahin hua he
 The idea of financial inclusion was put forward by the United Progressive Alliance government

 During November 8, 2016 to December 30, 2016, a huge amount of Rs 42,187 crore has been deposited in these accounts

 gujarat ke rajyasabha chunaav main jahaan ek-ek vot ke liye bijepi or congress ke bich jabardast maaramaari he, vahiin jediu ke vidhayak chotu basaava ne daawa kiya he ki unhone apana vot congressi ummidavaar ahamed patel ko diya he
 Chhotu Basava rejected the claim of his party leader KC Tyagi that the JDU MLA voted for the BJP

 Accused the General Secretary of not sending the message to the MLA, he was thrown out of the party
 udhar ensipi ke do vidhayakon ne kise vot diya isapar ab bhi suspence he
 It is believed that at least one of these two mlas has made it difficult for Congress leader Ahmed Patel by voting for the BJP candidate
 gauratlab he ki gujarat ke rajyasabha chunaav main agar ahamed patel ko jeet hasil kerani he to unhen kam se kam 45 vot chahie
 The Congress has 44 mlas, one of whom has done cross voting, ie the Congress candidate got 43 votes of the party
 iske alaava agar chotu basaava ke vot ko bhi ahamed patel ke khate main darj kar diya jaae to unhen mili voton kii sankhya 44 ho jaati he
 Ahmed Patel still needs one vote to win
 nesanalist congress party yani ensipi ke rajya main do vidhayak hai
 One of them is believed to have voted for the Congress and the other for the BJP
 ensipi ke do vidhayak jayant patel or kandhaal jadeja hai
 Even if this happens, Ahmed Patel's victory is certain
 lekin yadi in 45 main se kisi ek ne bhi nota kaa istemaal kiya hoga yaa phir bijepi pratyaashee ko vot diya hoga to patel kaa phir rajyasabha jane kaa sapana tut jayega
 The photo of Govind Longowal, the head of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee and general secretary of Pakistan Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee and pro-khalistan supporter Gopal Singh Chawla, is viral on the Internet
 navjot singh siddhu or chawla kii tasviir par hangaamaa khadaa karne vaale akali dal ke netalongowal or chawla kii tasviir ke sawaal par jawaab nahin de paae
 The Akali Dal created a furore over the photograph of Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and Pakistan Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee general secretary and Hafiz Saeed's henchman Gopal Singh Chawla
 lekin jab akali dal netaaon se shiromani gurudwara prabandhak samiti ke adhyaksh govind longowal or gopal singh chawla kii viral tasviir ke bare main poocha gaya to unase jawaab dete na bana
 He said that the Akali Dal was angry with Navjot Singh Sidhu, not because of the picture, because Pakistan, taking advantage of his presence, used the Kartarpur Corridor function to chant the melody of Kashmir
 haalanki jab unase poocha gaya ki kendriya mantri or akali dal netaa harsimrat cor badal bhi manch par bhartiya pratinidhi ke taur par maujuud thim to unhone aakhir pakistan dwaara bharat main failaae ja rahe aatankwaad kaa mudda kyon nahin uthaaya to cheema ne kaha, "ham samajhate hai ki harsimratcor badal jis manch par upasthit thim vahaan par koi bhi vivaadaaspad maamla oochaalnaa sahi nahin tha
 Significantly, Navjot Singh Sidhu, a cabinet minister in the Punjab government, who calls Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan an angel and a peace envoy, is on target of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Akali Dal

 vahiin, navjot singh siddhu ne captain amarinder singh kii salaah na maanate huepakistan jane kaa faisla kiya
 On the other hand, Shiromani Akali Dal has asked Congress chief Rahul Gandhi to clarify whether he is with Navjot Singh Sidhu or with Captain Amarinder Singh
 imran khan dwaara navjot singh siddhu kii pakistan prasiddhi ko lekar die gaye bayaan par chutki lete hue doctor dalajit singh cheema ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ko ab pakistan main bhi congress kii ek antarrashtriya ikai khol deni chahie taaki siddhu pakistan main chunaav lard saken

 He said, 'babri Masjid demolition is an internal matter of India
 yadi bharat sarkaar main kuwwat thi, to use pakistan se aae shishtmandal se in tippaniyon ke liye maafee maangane ko kahana chahie tha

 The soldiers are angry after the action taken against constables Prashant Chaudhary and Sandeep Kumar after the Vivek Tiwari murder case and they are opposing the action
 sipaahiyon ne virodh karne kii nayaa tarika dhundha he or cheharaa chhupaakar photo viral karne lage hai
 Soldiers are making the photo viral in many ways, in which they are wearing black helmets, they have put emojis on their faces
 aise main in police waalon kii pahchaan karnaa mushkil he
 Their opposition to this new way is clearly visible and difficult to identify
 philhal police ke adhikari aise virodh par apni pratikriya dene se batch rahe hai
 There have been many cases of kidnapping of his girlfriends by unsuccessful lovers, but it has rarely happened that a girlfriend has kidnapped her lover from her own home
 sunne main yah bhale hi ajeeb lage, lekin yah hakeekat he
 The case is in Sambhal district of Uttar Pradesh, where a girl abducted her boyfriend's bluff at the tip of a knife
 police sutron ne shuukravaar ko bataaya ki sambhal kotwali kshetra ke chaman sarai nivasee aasim ne report darj karai he ki uske bhai fahim ko dilli kii rahane vaali yuvati ne chaaku se daraakar or apane do saathiyon kii madad se bandhak banaakar agava kar liya
 He told that Faheem used to work in Delhi about three years ago
 is dauraan us ladki se uskaa prem prasang ho gaya or usne kathith taur par nikaah kaa vaada bhi kiya tha
 But later he left his girlfriend and moved to Ahmedabad

 In the 6-minute video, Hima Das is posted on lane number four
 fire hoti he
 The camera shows the runners from the stadium grounds
 hima das kaaphi der tak daud main paanchaven number par hoti hai
 Suddenly Hima is seen coming from far away
 camentator kii jubaan par unka naam daudane lagata he
 She gets close to the four runners from whom to get ahead
 tabhi camera apana pozishan badalata he
 Returns to the top angle from the side angle of the field
 yahi wo aitihaasik kshan he jab ham hima ko aage nikalate hue thik se nahin dekh pate he
 You cannot see Hima in those moments when she is pulling herself up while gathering her powers
 vah lamhaa bahut chota tha magar faaslaa bahut lanbaa tha
 Have watched this video many times
 maidan kii taraf se said angel kaa camera or camentator kii awaz jis tarah se hima main aage nikalne kii sambhaavna ko dekhakar uttejit hoti he, top angel kaa camera use thanda kar detaa he
 Hima Das is leaving behind four runners
 lambii chalaang laga rahi hai
 This player, who puts his everything at stake, starts looking at the camera from a distance
 wo sirf us line ko cross karte hue dikhaanaa chahta tha jisase koi number van hota he
 For a long time the camera was just watching the American champion
 daud ke antim antim jhanon tak american champion hi pramukhataa se dikhti he
 Just then, a shadow emerging from its shadow becomes large
 american champion ko peeche chhod detii he
 The camera recorded the history of winning Hima Das
 hima ne kaise us jeet ko hasil kiya he, uskaa nahin
 It is also a lesson that where the camera is focused, there is no winner
 camera chaahe jitani der tak kisi ko vijeta bana le, hima das jaisi koi nikal aegi
 Athlet coverage has improved significantly
 lekin focus khilaadi se hat kar line par shift ho gaya he
 Everyone has to see the final result
 kaash camera hima ke paanvon par hota he
 Would have been on the claws
 uski gardan kii nason par hota
 We wanted to see the golden lines of victory on his face, could not see
 hima das kaa yah video bataa rahaa he ki camera kaise apane pojishan se hi khilaadiyon main fark karata he
 Is the camera technology not so advanced that in that 59 seconds we can show 8 runners
 baad main to dikhaa hi sakate the
 The organizer should record the moment of each player separately and the winner should be made separately and released later
 bas yahi ki ham bharat kii hima ko ji bhar kar dekhnaa chaahate the
 The mind is full but not full

 _siddiqui) on Jan 19, 2019 at 5:18am PST Will the political drama of Karnataka stop with HD Kumaraswamy taking oath as Chief Minister on Wednesday? Preparations for the swearing-in ceremony are going on vigorously
 haalanki ye abhi rahasy hi bana hua he ki kumaraswami ke saath mantri ke taur par or koun- koun shapath legaa? jedies se kitne mantri honge or congress se kitne?jedies or congress donon ke hi top netaa chaahate to hai shapath grahan samaaroh bina kisi aadchan ke sampann ho lekin ye bhi sach he ki sarkaar main zyada se zyada hissedari paane ke liye donon taraf se rassakashi jari he
 This has given rise to speculation that both Congress and JDS want to see more and more of their ministers in the cabinet
 somvaar dopaher tak 20:14 formule kii baat suni ja rahi thi
 Under which 20 ministers of Congress and 14 ministers of JDS were to be made, but nothing has been revealed for sure
 media reports ke mutabik purv pradhanmantri or jedies kerashtriya adhyaksh echdi devgaudanheen chaahate ki kisi ko up mukhyamantri banaaya jaae
 According to Devgowda, if this is done, two power centers will be built
 haalanki congress kii ore se is bare main apni sthiti saaf nahin kii gai
 There will be a meeting soon between Kumaraswamy and Congress in-charge General Secretary KC Venugopal on the number of ministers and other issues
 mangalvaar shaam ko ye baithak hone kii sambhaavna he
 According to sources, Congress may be given the post of speaker
 iske liye halial se aath baar vidhayak chune gaye aarvi deshpandey or shrinivaspur se 5 baar vidhayak chune gaye keaar ramesh kumaar ke naam daud main shaamil bataae ja rahe hai
 According to sources, the Congress is not ready to agree on anything that threatens to annoy its own mlas
 aise main har vidhayak ko alag-alag bulaakar congress kii ore se uski raay lee ja rahi he jisase ki wo khud ko alag thalag mahasoos naa karen
 According to sources associated with the Congress, no formula has yet been agreed on the number of ministers
 is sandarbh main congress kii ore se aakhri faisla rahul gandhi kii ore se buudhvaar ko liya jayega ki party se koun-koun mantri banaaya jayega
 The big challenge before the Congress is how much representation can be made in the government formed in Karnataka
 congress ke rajya main 78 vidhayak chun kar aae hai phir bhi party ne sarkaar main junior partner banane kaa faisla kiya he
 Getting Congress mlas ready for this is not an easy task
 congress ke saamne duusari chunauti apane saare vidhayakon ko ekajute rakhana he
 There are also two independent mlas who are supporting the congress-jda
 unhen bhi saath jode rakhane kii mashkkat he ki kahin ve kisi baat par naaraaz naa ho jaaen
 The third major challenge before the Congress is to keep the party's top leaders like MB Patil, RV Deshpande, DK Shivkumar and Shamanur Shankarappa satisfied
 ye sabhi upmukhyamantri kii kursi ke daavedaar hai
 According to sources, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee President g Parameshwara's name is leading in the race for Deputy Chief Minister
 vahiin jedie kisi ko upmukhyamantri banaae jane ke hi paksh main nahin he
 For the Congress, it is like a rope walk

 donald trump ne apane bayaan main do hafte pehle kii mulaakaat kaa zikr kiya yani japan ke osaka main jo ji-20 summit hua us dauraan trump-modi main jo baat hui usamen kashmir kaa zikr hua tha
 But if sources are to be believed, nothing has happened in Osaka's meeting, this is being said from both sides
 america or bharat ke sutron kaa daawa he ki osaka main kashmir mudde par koi baat nahin hui thi
 In such a situation, what Donald Trump has said in front of Imran Khan, that claim can be wrong
 agar osaka main hui mulaakaat kii baat karen, to us rounssop meeting kii ek jaankaree donald trump kii beti ivaanka trump ne video jari kar di thi
 Ivanka Trump told that there was a discussion between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump about 5G, national security, trade and Iran
 gauratlab he ki us vakt bharat or america main tarriff war chal rahi thi or vahi baithak kaa agenda bhi rahaa tha
 Ivanka Trump is also an advisor to Donald Trump in the White House

 Kargil war hero and retired brigadier MPS Bajwa said that the surgical strikes have taken place earlier but are now being politicized
 tiger hill par kabja jamaane vaali brigade kii kaman bajva ke haathon main hi thi
 In a series of tweets, the retired Brigadier said that many controversial statements have been made on the surgical strike
 is par ho rahi raajnneeti ko dekhakar dukh ho rahaa he
 There have been such strikes at the sector level before
 ab unhen gaaje-baaje ke saath rashtriya str par kiya jaataa he lekin koi parinaam nahin dikhataa
 It is entirely based on 'no Casualty'
 1971 kaa bangladesh yuddh lard chuke empies bajva ne anya twit main likhaa, pehle huin 'sargical strike' sthaneey level par hoti thim, lekin nateezon ke saath asli dushman (pakistani sena) ko uskaa anjaam bhugatna padataa tha
 Bajwa wrote, In this we were also hurt many times
 lekin ab rashtriya str par aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf ek kilometre ke daayre main hi ise anjaam diya jaataa he, jiske nattejey bhi dikhaai nahin dete
 Bajwa, who has been awarded the Bravery Award, later tweeted a tweet, in which he clarified
 isamen unhone likhaa, mere twit ko raajnneetik angel se na dekhen
 i am just a soldier
 meraa makasad army oparation se jude facts ko baahar laana he
 i am not against recent surgical strikes
 yah ek shandaar kaam tha
 Lot many controversial statements on Surgical Strikes
 Sad that it’s been politicised 
 Such strikes at sector levels were carried out earlier also
 Now done at National level , with publicity & fanfare but with no visible results
 Total emphasis on 'no Casuality' to be incurred— Brig MPS Bajwa (R) (@brigmps) May 6, 2019 , at times we too suffered but this time, although, at national level but only within one Km distance against militants without visible results
 — Brig MPS Bajwa (R) (@brigmps)may 6, 2019A clarification
 
 Kindly all are requested NOT to view my tweets from any political angle 
 
 
 
 i am a ‘die Hard’ Soldier
 Aim is to bring out facts related to Army operations, i have nothing against the Surgical Strikes carried out recently
 
 It was indeed a marvellous job done — Brig MPS Bajwa (R) (@brigmps) May 6, 2019 19 soldiers were killed in the Uri terrorist attack on 18 September 2016, after which the para commandos of the Indian Army entered into the pok of the terrorists
 Launch pads were devastated
 pehali baar sena ne press conference kar isaki jaankaree di thi
 After this a lot of politics was also done on this
 piem narendra modi or bhaajapa netaaon ne bhaashanon main ise jamkar bhunaaya tha
 Opposition parties accused the central government of doing politics on the valor of the army
 is saal 14 farvari ko hue pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad bhartiya vayusena ne balakot sthit jaish-e-mohammad ke thikaanon par bam barasaakar unhen nestnabud kar diya tha

 haal hi main congress ne upie kii manmohan singh sarkaar ke dauraan hue sargical strike kii suchi jari kii, jisamen taarikh bhi bataai gai thi
 The Congress had said that surgical strikes were carried out 6 times under the UPA regime and twice during the tenure of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
 lekin na to manmohan singh or na hi vaajapeyi ne ise lekar press conference kii
 The Congress also said that he never bounced back on a surgical strike in the past
 There is no question of forming an alliance with @bjp4maharashtra
 NCP has unanimously decided to ally with @shivsena & @incmaharashtra to form the government
 Shri Ajit Pawar's statement is false and misleading in order to create confusion and false perception among the people
 Earlier, Maharashtra Deputy CM Ajit Pawar tweeted, 'I am in NCP and will always be in NCP and Sharad Pawar Saheb is our leader
 ' unhone aage likhaa, 'hamaara BJP-NCP gathbandhan agle paanch varshon ke liye maharashtra main ek sthir sarkaar pradaan karegaa jo rajya or iske logon ke kalyaan ke liye eemaandaaree se kaam karegi
 i am in the NCP and shall always be in the NCP and @pawarspeaks Saheb is our leader
 Our BJP-NCP alliance shall provide a stable Government in Maharashtra for the next five years which will work sincerely for the welfare of the State and its people

 However, China has insisted that it has not encroached on Indian territory

 At the same time, Defense Minister AK Antony said that this tension on the border is not created by India and we will do whatever is possible in the interest of the country
 china ne phir yah maang rakhi he ki bharat purvi ladakh main apane maujuuda buniyadi dhaanche ko tode or koi nayaa nirmaan na kare
 India rejected China's demand, saying that all the construction was done or happening in Indian territory, so there is no question of stopping them
 china ne suzav rakhaa ki donon pakshon ko peeche hatana chahie, taaki aamane−saamne kii takaraav kii surat na rahe
 India turned down the suggestion, saying that China should completely withdraw from the occupied territory
 tippaniyan China's tensions in the Indian border are moving away from the Daulat Beg Oldi sector of Ladakh, and China's tents are increasing

 He has collected all the weapons
 yahi nahin bhartiya sena kii harakat par china lagaataar najar rakh rahaa he
 It has also deployed the dreaded molecer dogs, not only that, China has also started telling it through banners that this is its territory and no one should try to get into it
 beshak, bhartiya jawan thodi duuri par camp banaakar china par najar rakh rahe hon, lekin yah bhi sach he ki china ko peeche hatane ke liye majaboor karne main bharat ab tak naakaam rahaa he
 The diplomatic conversation also seems to be farcical

 Earlier, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that this is a local level problem, which will be solved

 The problem of line of absolute control was even counted, but the question arises as to why there is so much hesitation in saying its territory
 china bharat kii seemaa main daakhil hua he to uski kade shabdon main ninda kyon nahin
 Why the government policy on the border with China looks different

 Earlier it was reported that Chinese soldiers have set up another tent in Daulat Beg Oldi sector of Ladakh
 iske saath hi ghuspaith vaali jagah par aise dhaanchon kii sankhya badhkar paanch ho gai he
 On this issue, a third flag meeting was held on Tuesday between Indian and Chinese military officers
 mana ja rahaa he ki is baithak main baat kuch aage badi he
 The Chinese side has said that there should be a gap between the military posts of the two countries
 vahiin, rakshaamantri eke antni ne kaha ki sarhad par yah tanaav bharat kaa banaaya hua nahin he or ham desh hit main jo bhi mumkin hoga, karenge
 China has again demanded that India break its existing infrastructure in eastern Ladakh and not build any new ones
 bharat ne china kii maang yah kehete hue khaarij kar di ki saare nirmaan bhartiya kshetra main hue hai yaa ho rahe hai, isliye unhen rokane kaa koi sawaal nahin
 China suggested that the two sides should retreat, so that a face-to-face confrontation would not occur
 bharat ne yah kehete hue suzav thukraa diya ki china kabja kiye ilaake se puri tarah hat jaae
 The comments bhartiya seemaa main china kii badhati siinaajori ladakh ke daulat beg oldy sector main hatana to dur china ke tent badhate ja rahe hai
 China has installed five tents
 hathiyaaron kaa puraa jakhira usne jamaa kar liya he
 Not only this, China is constantly monitoring the movement of Indian Army
 usne khoonkhaar molesar kute bhi tainaat kar rakhe hai, sirf yahi nahin china ne bannron ke jariye yah bhi bataanaa shuru kar diya he ki yah uskaa ilaaka he or usamen daakhil hone kii koshish koi na kare
 Of course, Indian soldiers are keeping a close watch on China by making camps, but it is also true that India has so far failed to force China to retreat
 kootnithik baatcheet bhi ab tak to benatija hi najar aati he
 Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid is visiting China from 9 May
 unhone kaha he ki yatra radd karne kaa philhal koi sawaal nahin he
 He has again expressed confidence that the problem will be solved
 isse pehle pradhanmantri manmohan singh kah chuke hai ki yah ek sthaneey str kii samasya he, jise hal kar liya jayega
 The response of the Ministry of External Affairs has also been very modest
 line of ekchul control kii samasya tak gina di gai, lekin sawaal uthta he ki aakhir apane kshetra ko apana kehane main itani hichak kyon he
 China has entered the Indian border so why not condemn it in strong words
 kyon china se satee seemaa ko lekar sarkaar kii niti alag dikhti he
 Can the government not put pressure on China in another way, why should India appear soft state in front of China? china ne phir yah maang rakhi he ki bharat purvi ladakh main apane maujuuda buniyadi dhaanche ko tode or koi nayaa nirmaan na kare

 The more legal bets that n Srinivasan is playing, the more difficulties are increasing
 8 farvari ko bisisiai kii varking cameti kii baithak kii adhyakshata karne par supreme court ne shrinivasana par sakht naaraazgi jaahir kii he or shuukravaar tak unase jawaab maanga he
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court put Srinivasan in the dock of questions
 court ne kaha ki jab unhen bisisiai chunaav main hissaa lene se roka gaya to wo baithak kii adhyakshata kaise kar sakate hai
 The Supreme Court is unhappy with his attitude
 shrinivasana ko court ke adeshon kii bhaawanaaon ko samajhnaa chahie
 He may have done anything for the game, but his role in the court order is unstable
 court ne shrinivasana ke vakil kapil sible se ye bhi poocha ki kya court ke aadesh ke baad shrinivasana kii pojishan main kuch sudhaar aayaa he
 However, Kapil Sibal said no and asked the court not to issue a notice of contempt in this case
 prasal cricket aisasiation of bihar ne supreme court main adaalat kii avmaananaa kii yachika daakhil kar kaha he ki shrinivasana ne supreme court ke aadesh ke baavjood aath farvari ko bisisiai kii varking cameti kii meeting kii adhyakshata kii
 Apart from Srinivasan in this case, Supreme Court appointed interim board president Shivlal Yadav, board secretary Sanjay Patel and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary have also been demanded for running a contempt of court case
 2 march ko bisisiai ke chunaav hone hai
 But before this, the contempt case is another problem for Srinivasan
 modi sarkaar ne apane duusare kaarykaal kaa pehla bajet pesh kar diya he
 The opposition has also targeted this budget
 bihar kii mukhya vipakshi party rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke netaa or bihar ke purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne bhi bajet ko khokhla bataaya he
 Tejashwi has said that the budget is completely airborne and hollow

 There is no doubt that if Patna, the capital of Bihar, is troubled and devastated by water logging for the last 7 days, then everyone including Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi are responsible
 lekin dono dalon ke netaaon ke bich ab bayanon ke madhyam se jo ho rahaa he, usase to lagata he ki janata ke bich ek duusare ko villen ghoshit karne ke liye ye koi mauka nahin ganvaana chaahate
 Firstly, the process of blaming Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for water logging started from the BJP and was started by Union Minister Giriraj Singh
 unhone rajya sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraate hue apane naatakeey andaaj main maafee maangi
 Then came the newly appointed BJP President Sanjay Jaiswal in his support
 sanjay kaa ek purana ghar patna ke rajendra nagar ilaake main bhi he or unhone bhi rajya sarkaar ko jal jamaav ke liye aatmamanthan karne kii salaah di
 The extent was reached when Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that no one speaks when Mumbai also sinks, on which a newly appointed spokesperson of BJP, Nikhil Anand cut his talk and said that water also gets out from there soon
 bhaajapa netaaon ke bayaan se saaf tha ki wo puure jal jamaav kaa thikra nitish kumaar par phodna chaahate the
 He knows that despite being a BJP minister in the Municipal Development Department, despite the Municipal Corporation being in his possession and all the mlas of the city belong to the BJP, there is nothing left to defend after that
 isliye nitish ko ghero ke alaava bhaajapa ke paas apane bachaav main koi hathiyaar nahin bachaa tha
 Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad's statement to the Janata Dal United also came to light when he published news in Patna newspapers regarding the water logging that after his initiative 119 gates of Farakka Barrage have now been opened
 jabaki vahaan maatr 109 get hai
 That is why Janata Dal United, especially Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, came to know that the ministers of the BJP have rubbished the entire development of the city because whenever they do some review in the context of drainage, more than one flaw will come
 yahaan tak ki pump house kaa rakh rakhaav bhi thik nahin tha
 Therefore, he gave two statements on Tuesday that once the water logging is low, the department will review one thing by itself and the other who are trying to submerge them will not succeed and their faith is in work and those who do not work They only promote
 usee ke do ghante ke andar bhaajapa saansad ramkripal yadav photo khinchane ke chakkar main pani main doobane se bache
 But after Nitish's statement, Janata Dal leaders especially Ranveer Nandan asked who was responsible for maintaining this department and the municipal corporation and the city? He clearly said that the responsibility of the BJP minister, BJP MLA and bjp's Meyer, but they are deliberately misleading people
 is bayaan se saaf tha ki janata dal united nitish ko gherne or unhen katghare main khadaa karne kii koshish ke bare main bhaajapa kii ranneeti ke bare main parichit he or wo uskaa jawaab dena bhi jaanati he
 Janata Dal United has its own assessment that as the water decreases the story of bjp's failure will open layer by layer and BJP is afraid that once Nitish Kumar becomes active in the department, his status will be nothing but a silent audience

 It is claimed that no other candidate has filled the form in front of BJP candidate Kento Jini and they have won the Lok Sabha elections uncontested from here
 india today anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne padtaal main is daawey ko bhraamak paaya
 Kento Jini has contested the assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh and the only candidate before him was from the Congress, whose form was rejected in Scrutiny
 viral post kaa archivd varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 The Facebook page "entertainment" has posted a photo of Kento Jini on which it reads: "bjp's account opened before voting in Arunachal, no one filled the form in front of the NDA, awe says 72 thousand is of no use

 "by the time the news was written, this post had been shared more than 10 thousand times
 fasebuk yujar "kuldeep Nehra" or "chaukeedaar sahab yadav" ne bhi yah post share kii he
 When we started searching for news related to Kento Jini to investigate the viral claim, we got several media reports which wrote that he was elected unopposed, although it was worth noting in these reports that Kento of Arunachal Pradesh Assembly He has contested the election and the only candidate before him was from Congress, whose form was rejected in Scrutiny
 bataa den ki arunachal pradesh main vidhansabha or loksabhaa donon hi chunaavon ke liye 11 apral ko matdaan hua tha
 He is contesting for the Kento Assembly from Along East (ST), one of the 60 seats in Arunachal Pradesh
 bijepi ne 17 march ko hi rajya main vidhansabha siton par apane ummidavaaron kisuchijari kii thi, jisamen kento kaa bhi naam tha
 Congress, while releasing the list for this seat, had decided to field its candidate Minkir Lawlen
 jiske baad lolen ne parchaa bhi bharaa tha, lekin chunaav ayog ne ise invalid bataate hue radd kar diya tha
 Kento was then elected unopposed from this seat
 kento ke alaava yachuli seat se bijepi ke taaba tedir or dirang seat se congress or swatantra ummidavaar ke namakan waapas lene ke baad phurpa sering bhi nirvirodh vidhayak chune gaye hai

 suchi ke anusaar bijepi ne arunachal west seat se kiran rigiju or arunachal east seat se tapir gaao ko chunavi maidan main utaara he

 Shortly after Jayanthi Natarajan's letter was leaked, the Finance Minister and the Environment Minister clearly said that all the projects that were stalled by her (jayanthi Natarajan) as Environment Minister would be reviewed soon
 bijepi ke duusare mantriyon or netaaon ne bhi is par turant aise hi bayaan dene shuru kar die hai, lekin paryaavaran ke jaankaar or adaalaton main alag-alag maamalon ko lekar lard rahe log isse chaukanne ho gaye hai
 The Congress party also reacted immediately, saying that the BJP government wants to use Jayanthi Natarajan's letter to give green signal to the projects which could not pass during the UPA government
 congress ke pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne enditivi india se baatcheet main kaha, 'bhartiya janata party natarajan kii chitthee kaa istemaal apane jebi udyogpatiyon ke vah saare project paas karaane ke liye karnaa chaahati he, jinako paryaavaran kii manzuri khaarij kar di gai thi
 Surjewala also questioned why not a single project has been stopped since the coming of BJP government
 sari pariyojnaon ko kaise hari jhandi mil gai hai
 On the other hand, environmental lawyer Rahul Chaudhary says, 'the biggest irony today is that the former environment minister of the country is clarifying that he was under pressure to investigate development projects, whereas the work of environment minister is the same
 Projects have to be examined under laws
 ' The debate is raising the question whether the Ministry of Environment will now show speed in passing the project, even if the companies are lax in complying with the laws
 yah bahes isliye tej ho rahi he, kyonki jin pariyojnaon ko lekar vivaad hua he yaa roke jane par sawaal uthe hai unhen adaalaton ne bhi katghare main khadaa kiya he
 Vedanta's case is prominent in the big cases which were disputed during the UPA government, which has also been stayed by the Supreme Court
 is bich jayanti natarajan se pehle upie sarkaar main paryaavaran mantri rah chuke jairam ramesh rahul gandhi ke bachaav main khadey hue or kaha ki un par (jairam par) paryaavaran mantri rahete rahul ne sidhe yaa paroksh rup se koi dabaav nahin daalaa
 However, it is also true that what Rahul Gandhi said in the FICCI program shortly before the election gave rise to talk of a dilemma within the Congress about the environment
 yah paigaam gaya ki congress jal, jangal, zamin or adivaasiyon ke saath garibon ko bachaana chaahati he yaa udyogon ke paksh main khadaa hona chaahati he
 The BJP tried to corner the Congress on this issue
 vittamantri arun jetali ne shuukravaar ko kaha, 'upie sarkaar ke vakt paryaavaran ke maamle main manamaani ke saath anumati di jaati thi yah afvaah sach sabit hui he
 The country's economy was messing with
 logon ko takalif dene main inhen (upie sarkaar ko) mazaa aata tha
 ' lekin aankade or tathy vittamantri ke aarope se bhi mail nahin khate
 If Jairam Ramesh and Jayanthi Natarajan combine the tenure, there are many cases where the ministry gave the green signal to the project but it was stopped by the court
 isamen korian steel company posco kaa odisha main lagane vaala steel plant, andhra pradesh or chhattisgarh ke kuch power plant or madhya pradesh ke mahaan jangalon main khanan ke saath kai maamle shaamil hai
 In the case of Nirma's steel plant in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, the local villagers protested, after which the court stayed the project
 haalanki baad main neshnal green tribunel ne use zarur hari jhandi di
 Posco's case remained muddled and the fine imposed by the Adani Group for ignoring the rules in Mundra Port area is still in court
 ye sawaal abhi isliye ahm hai, kyonki modi sarkaar ke vakt main paryaavaran mantralay ne na keval ab tak saare project paas kiye hai, balki vah paryaavaran ke saare niyamon main badlaav ke liye sansad main bill laane vaali he, lekin jis tiesar subrahmanyam cameti kii siforeeshon par nayaa kanoon ban rahaa he us par pehle hi kai sawaal khadey hai
 Ritwik Dutta, an advocate for environmental affairs, also wrote a letter to the government questioning the legality of the TSR committee
 congress netaa or purv paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ne kaha he ki tiesar cameti kii siforishein paryaavaran ko barabaad karne vaali hai
 ' saaf he ki jahaan jayanti natarajan kaa maamla raajnneetik rup se bhaanmati kaa pitara kholane vaala lag rahaa he
 On the other hand, there are many layers behind it, which will raise controversy in the coming days
 paryaavaran kii phikr karne vaale or ab zyada chaukanna hokar sarkaar kii ore se pariyojnaon ko milane vaali hari jhandi par nazar rakhenge
 The Maharashtra government transferred an IPS in a hurry on Thursday
 mumbai police ke joint seepi dhananjay kamalaakar ko guuruuvaar shaam taatkaal prabhaav se unki jimmedaari se mukt kiya gaya
 He was the head of the Mumbai Police's investigation into the financial scam
 kamalaakar ke bete kaa naam isi din maharashtra industrial deveopment korporation arthath MIDC kii sarkari jameen ko hadapney ke vivaad main uchhla tha
 In the land scam that surfaced on Thursday, it was found that Rohit Kamalakar, son of IPS Dhananjay Kamalakar, is accused of grabbing government land in Pune's Ranjangaon MIDC
 aarope yah bhi the ki andaajan 205 karod rupee kii is jameen ko rohit ne aunipauni qeemat par karidaa
 However, there was no clear disclosure of where the funds were raised for the ISA deal
 jisase rajanithik halkon main ye sawaal uthaa ki bete ke itane ahm faisle kii soochna pita ko na ho aisa kaise ho saktaa he? The matter became more serious when in an exclusive conversation with NDTV India, the state's industry minister Subhash Desai said that the disputed land belonged to the MIDC and Rohit Kamalkar and others tried to grab it by misguiding the MIDC by adopting wrong methods
 sarkaar is frod ke khilaaf court main ladaai ladate hue yah maang karti he ki vivaadit jameen ke saude ko radd kiya jaae
 The political atmosphere changed after the government minister's statement
 sarkaar par is baat ko lekar dabaav tha ki wo sarkari jameen hadapney ke maamle main kathor karrwai kare
 Similarly, senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse has recently been removed from the post on charges of grabbing government land
 is maamle main 4 june 2016 pune SP ke karyaalay main FIR hui he
 However, the court has refused to buy Rohit Kamlakar and others government land
 jiske baad gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se MIDC kii jameen kharidne maamle kii jaanch kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 So that the culprits can be processed

 Praveen Salunkhe will replace Kamalakar

 Dhananjay Kamalakar as Crime Branch chief of Mumbai Police arrested the infamous Farid Tanasha and Vicky Malhotra, members of the Chhota Rajan gang
 unki is karrwai par tab kaiyon kii bhaven tan gayi thi
 It is being told that this action of Kamlakar destroyed the first and last attempt of Indian security agencies to eliminate the mafia kingpin Dawood Ibrahim
 guuruuvaar ko saamne aae jameen ghotaale main paaya gaya ki ipies dhananjay kamalaakar ke bete rohit kamalaakar par pune kii ranjangaanv MIDC main sarkari jameen hadapney kaa aarope he
 There were also allegations that Rohit bought this land worth Rs 205 crore at a price of Rs
 lekin, is saude ke liye rakam kahaan se jutai iskaa spasht khulaasa nahin kiya
 Which raised the question in political circles that how can such a decision be made about the son not being informed by the father? maamla tab or gambhir hua jab NDTV india se exclusive baatcheet main rajya ke udyogmantri subhash desai ne kaha ki vivaadit jameen MIDC kii hi he or galat taur tareekon ko apanaakar MIDC ko gumraah kar ise hadapney kii koshish rohit kamalaakar or anya logon ne kii
 The government, while fighting in court against this fraud, demands that the disputed land deal be canceled
 sarkari mantri ke is bayaan ke baad raajnneetik maahaul hi badal gaya
 There was pressure on the government to take drastic action in the matter of land grab
 gyaat ho ki isi tarah sarkari jameen ko hadapney ke aarope main bijepi ke varisht netaa ekanath khadse ko haal hi main pad se hataaya gaya he
 In this case, FIR has been lodged in the office of Pune SP on 4 June 2016

 After which an investigation has been announced into the matter of illegally buying MIDC land

 mumbai police ki krime branch pramukh ke rup main dhananjay kamalaakar ne chota rajan giroh ke sadsy kukhyat farid tanasha or viki malhotra ko giraftaar kiya tha
 On this action of his, many people were angry
