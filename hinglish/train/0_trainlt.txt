 is tarah aise log kai baar atm kaa istemaal karte hai
 There are also some people who use net banking or mobile banking more and use ATM to check account balance
 agar aap inamen se kisi category main aate hai to aapako apni aadat badal leni chahie kyonki arabiai ne atm istemaal kii fees ko lekar nae guidelins jari kiye hai
 ATM usage includes withdrawing cash, checking account balance or taking mini statements

 arabiai ke nae niyamon kaa asar desh kii adhiktar janata par pad rahaa he
 In such a situation, we are telling you some tips here so that even after the new rules of ATM transaction, your pocket will not be affected
 1
 Avoid cash transactions: If you are among those who use cash transactions for every purchase and other financial transactions, then you can also take another route
 aap har baar cash kaa istemaal karne ke bajaay electronic fund transfar, credit or debit card, check or demand draft kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 2
 kam paise nikaalane kii aadat badalenetm tranjaction kii fees badhane ke baad aap is baat kaa khaastaur par khyal rakhen ki atm se kam-kam rakam na nikaalen
 3
 cash nikaalane ke liye bank jaaen:agar aapako badi maatra main cash nikaalnaa ho to aapke liye behatar hoga ki aap atm jane ke bajaay bank kii shakha main jaaen
 Although going to a bank branch may cause some inconvenience, but it is a good idea to avoid ATM transaction fees
 haalanki, agar maheene main keval ek baar hi is tarah kaa cash nikaalane kii jarurat pade to bank main line lagane se behatar he ki thodaa charge dekar atm kaa hi istemaal kar len
 4
 statement ke liye online banking kaa istemaandhiktar log apane account kaa statement check karne, mini statement lene yaa haalia tranjaction kaa print lene ke liye atm kaa istemaal karte hai
 ATM usage involves withdrawing cash, checking account balance or taking a mini statement, so you can take advantage of online banking facility instead of going to an ATM for an account statement

 West Indian great batsman Brian Lara has said that Indian cricket batsman Sachin Tendulkar has the same position in cricket as Michael Jordan in basketball and Mohammad Ali in boxing
 bryan lara ne yah bhi kaha ki sachin tendulkar ko apane kariyar ke 200wein or antim test match main 400 ran banane kaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 It is noteworthy that in the history of cricket, Brian Lara is the only player to score 400 runs in an innings of a Test match
 purv bhartiya captain saurav ganguli ke saath ek tok sho ke dauraan west indies ke purv captain bryan lara ne kaha ki mahanata ke lihaaz se koi bhi cricketer sachin tendulkar ke aas-paas bhi nahin pahunch saktaa
 According to Brian Lara, "as far as statistics are concerned, you can also find players with better statistics, because cricket is a game of uncertainties, and nothing can be said, what will happen
" 
 
 ek-divasiy antarrashtriya maichon main viraat kohli bahut acha kar rahe hai
 
 
 There are some people in boxing too, whose figures are better than Mohammed Ali, but if you talk about boxing, you have to talk about Mohammad Ali
 
 
 isi tarah jab aap basketbaal kii baat karenge, to maaikel jordan kaa naam lenaa hi hoga
 
 
 And in the same way when you talk about cricket, you will speak about Sachin Tendulkar
 
 
 '' Brian Lara said that Sachin Tendulkar should not take performance stress in his 200th match and just enjoy the game
 unhone kaha, ''main unase kahuunga, aapkaa cricket kariyar sabhi ke mukaable sarvottam rahaa he
 
 
 i don't think the career of any player can be compared to the cricketing career of Sachin Tendulkar
 
 
 bas, cricket ke agle paanch dinon kaa anand lijie
 
 
 You have the ability to score 400 runs, go and make 400 runs
 
 
 '' Asked what you think was going on in Sachin Tendulkar's mind before the final Test match, Brian Lara said, "it is very difficult to guess
" 
 
 " In fact, according to the Karnataka Jail Manuel, the prison in question can meet their lawyers or acquaintances and relatives twice a week, while the punishment is 2 times in 15 days

 pehle charan main pashchim uttar pradesh kii saharanpur seat par har kisi kii najar he, kyonki yah ekmaatr seat maani ja rahi he jis par bijepi, basapa or congress ke bich trikoniya muqabla dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 BJP has again nominated its sitting MP Raghav Lakhanpal as its candidate while Congress has given ticket to Imran Masood
 masood ne 2014 main lakhanpal ko kadi takkar di thi or lakhanpal kareeb 65 hajaar voton se hi jeet paae the
 As a coalition candidate, the BSP has also given Fazlur Rahman a ticket from this seat
 saharanpur loksabhaa seat par kahani dilachasp dikhaai de rahi he
 Muslims have a large presence in the Saharanpur parliamentary constituency and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) occupied this seat in 2014
 pashchim upi kii jin aath siton par pehle charan ke tahat 11 april ko matdaan ho rahaa he, unamem congress ko saharanpur main apni sthiti sabase majboot najar aa rahi he
 The reason for this is the 2014 election results, when despite the Modi wave, Congress candidate Imran Masood was just 65 thousand votes behind from bjp's winning candidate Raghav Lakhanpal
 darasal, saharanpur loksabhaa kshetra main kareeb 38 fisadi muslim hai, jin par congress kii ek baar phir najar he or bispi ko muslim vot bank ke bantane kaa khatra sata rahaa he, kyonki haji fajalurrahman ke rup main gathbandhan ne bhi muslim pratyaashee ko maidan main utaara he
 Imran Masood is also being considered a big angle
 congress ke ummidavaar imran masood 2014 main us vakt vivaadon main aae the jab unpar pradhanmantri modi ko dhamkee dene kaa aarope laga tha or police ne unhen giraftaar kiya tha
 Recently, in his rally, PM Modi attacked Imran Masood of Congress and said that Saharanpur also has a lot of siblings and is very much a favorite of Congress prince
 wo boti-boti karne vaale log hai or ham beti-beti ko suraksha dene vaale log hai
 Masood has a greater hold in the traditional Muslim community
 haalanki, maance kaarobaari bispi ummidavaar kaa muslim samudaay ke pichde tabakon main kaaphi prabhaav mana ja rahaa he
 In 2014, BJP got the benefit of the Muslim vote sharing of votes
 tab espi ne imran masood ke bhattije or paanch baar saansad rahe raashid masood ke bete shajaan ko tikat diya tha
 Imran got close to four lakh eight thousand votes
 vahiin, shajaan baawan hajaar vot ke saath chauthe sthaan par the
 In the last election, Jagdish Singh Rana received two lakh thirty five thousand votes and was third
 is puure vot bantwaare ke baad bijepi ne saharanpur seat paanch fisadi se zyada ke margin se jeet lee thi
 Perhaps this is the reason why at the first joint rally of SP-BSP-RLD in Deoband, Saharanpur on April 7, BSP supremo Mayawati has openly told the Muslim community that if the BJP is to be defeated, the Congress should not vote and distribute votes

 Targeting political parties to politicize Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's legacy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday that no other government has done as much work as his government did to increase the honor of Baba Saheb

 tippaniyan After inaugurating the Western Court Annexe Bhawan attached to the hostels of mps, Modi said that people used Ambedkar's name for political gains
 unhone kaha ki unki sarkaar ne ambedkar antarrashtriya centre ko puraa kiya jiskaa vichaar us samay kiya gaya tha jab centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar thi
 Modi said that the previous UPA government did not take this project forward for years
 pradhanmantri kaa yah bayaan aise samay main aayaa he jab essi-asti atyaachaar nivarak kanoon par ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle ko lekar bharat band ke dauraan desh ke kai hisson main baari virodh pradarshan dekhne ko mila
 The Prime Minister said that by completing many projects in memory of Baba Saheb, our government gave them proper place
 unhone kaha ki 26 alipur road sthit jis makaan main baba sahab ne antim saans lee, use ambedkar jayanti kii purv sandhya par raashtra ko samarpit kiya jaayegaa
 The comments saansadon ke hostel se jude western court anexi bhawan kaa udghaatan karne ke baad modi ne kaha ki logon ne ambedkar ke naam kaa raajnneetik phaayde ke liye istemaal kiya

 kuch samay pehle is tarah kaa vishwaas dilaayaa gaya tha ki aadhaar card bilkul surakshit he
 The Aadhaar-making authority UIDAI also said that the personal information of everyone in the Aadhaar card is absolutely safe
 lekin agar aap aisa sochate hai to bilkul galat he
 You can get information of crores of Aadhaar cards in just 10 minutes by paying only 500 rupees
 ye baat thodi chaunkaane vaali he, lekin aisa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 The English newspaper, The Tribune, has conducted an investigation in which such things have been revealed
 tribune ke anusaar, unhone ek whatsap group se maatr 500 rupee main ye sarvice kharidi or kareeb 100 karod aadhaar card kaa acces mil gaya
 In fact, in their investigation, they came to know about an agent
 jiske baad agent ne maatr 10 minute main ek getwe diya or log-in password diya
 After that, all they had to do was to enter the Aadhaar card number and easily got personal information about any person
 iske baad 300 rupee adhik dene par unhen us aadhaar card kii jaankaree ko print karwaane kaa bhi acces mil gaya
 There was a separate software for this
 ye jaankaree ho rahi hai li -naam, pataa, pin code, photo, phone number, email idisuidhai ne liya sangyaanjab is bare mendhuidharfasaron ko bataaya gaya, to unhone turant sangyaan lete hue is maamle ko bangaloru main technicl team ko isse avgat karaayaa
 Sanjay Jindal, Regional Additional director-general, UIDAI in Chandigarh, said that if this is true then it is quite shocking because no one other than the director-general and me should have a login password
 6 maheene se chal rahaa he grushkhbaar ke mutabik, ye group kareeb 6 maheene se kaam kar rahaa he
 a racket first targeted the three lakh people who worked at the centers opened under the Common Service Center Scheme by the Ministry of IT
 unhone in logon se aadhaar ke bare main sari jaankaree nikaalnaa aasaan samajha or unhen hi apane chagul main fansaa liya
 Apart from this, hackers also got access to the Aadhaar card website of Rajasthan
 jisase ve aadhaar kii jaankaree or use print karvaa sakate the
 Sanjay Jindal has said that UIDAI will investigate this now, only then will it be confirmed in any way
 saaf he ki agar is tarah kii koi bhi khami pai gai he to kaaphi badi chook he
 Since, by taking information of Aadhaar card in this way, any SIM card, bank account, these other types can be wrongly availed

 a website named The Sunrise Today published an article on 3 December titled 'bangla became the second language of London'

 It is followed by Polish and Turkish
 website ke is lekh kaa archivd varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 Similarly, Facebook page 'getbengal' has shared a link to its own website claiming, 'BREAKING! Bengali has officially become the second largest language spoken in London
 iske baad polish or turki hai
 Proud to be Bengali, proud of your mother tongue! This article claimed, 'bengali is officially the second language of London, Bangla is the main language of about 71,609 people living in London
 'india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne apni padtaal main paaya ki yah daawa galat he
 This is actually a survey conducted by a private institution, which states that Bangla is the second language most commonly spoken in London after English
 haalanki, viral ho raheis lekhamen is survey kaa zikr to kiya gaya he lekin galat tareeke se yah daawa kiya gaya he ki isaki 'aadhikarik ghoshnaa' hui he
 By the time this story is written, this post has been shared more than 600 times on Facebook
 iskaa archivd varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 afwa's investigation: We searched with the help of keywords on Google to investigate the claim that Bangla language has got any official announcement about the second language of London? But we could not find anything in this regard
 hamen ek privet sanstha 'city Lit' kii ore se landan main boli jane vaali bhashaaon par kiye gaye survey kii jaankaree jarur mili
 On 19 November, 'city Lit' published a survey report showing that Bangla is the second most widely spoken language in London
 report main kaha gaya he, 'hamane haal hi main aam taur par sarvaadhik boli jane vaali fahrren language ko lekar landan main ek research kiya
 
 
 Our research has revealed that Bangla is the second most commonly used language after English
 iske baad polish or turki he
 There are 71,609 people living in London who speak Bangla
 teen ilaakon main yah sabase zyada istemaal hoti he- camden, neuham or tower hemalats- ye teenon shahar ke sabase bade ilaake hai
 'clearly this report has nothing to do with the census conducted by the British Government
 sirf sarkari janaganana ke dwaara hi yah 'aadhikarik ghoshnaa' kii ja sakati he ki kisi ilaake main koun si bhashaa sabase zyada boli jane vaali bhashaa he
 The last such census was done in 2011 by the British government
 isjanagananke mutabik, angreji britain kii mukhya bhashaa he jise bolne waalon kii sankhya 92% pratishat he
 In 2014, a website named randomlylondon published a map illustration based on the 2011 census
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki landan main angreji ke baad sabase zyada boli jane vaali bhashaaen polish or turki hai
 What is City Lit? City Lit (https: / / www

 uk / ) landan kii ek sanstha he jo art, dizin or bhashaa main vibhinn lambii or choti avadhi ke course karaati he
 The institution was established in 2019 and its registered office is in Keeley Street, Convent Garden, London
 nishkarshabritish sarkaar kii aadhikarik website kahati he ki agali janaganana 2021 main hogi
 Thus it is clear that only after this census the condition of the languages of Britain and London will be clear
 isliye kaha ja saktaa he ki viral ho rahaa daawa galat he ki bangla landan main boli jane vaali duusari sabase badi bhashaa he

 kaarykram chhodkar jane se pehle chiraag paswan ne jila adhyaksh abhishek kumaar singh se kaha ki unhone ab tak 22 jilon kaa daura kiya he magar sivaan kii sthiti sabase kharaab pai
 On the go, Chirag Paswan also threatened the District President that he would complain to LJP National President Ram Vilas Paswan and would demand action against the Siwan District Committee
 chiraag paswan ke kaaryakarta sammelan se jane ke badalospa ke kaaryakarta unke khilaaf narebajikarne lage
 District President Abhishek Kumar Singh said that the top leadership of LJP, who had been nominated for the new 2015 assembly election from Siwan, did not themselves come to attend the event, so where will the crowd come from? chiraag paswan ke ravaiye se naaraaz hokar buudhvaar ko sivaan jila adhyaksh abhishek kumaar singh samet lojpa sivaan jila cameti ke padaadhikariyon ne apana istipha de diya

 desh main lagaataar duusare saal hui kam varsha or 10 rajyon ke sookhaa prabhavit ghoshit hone se upje halaat par kendriya krishi mantri radhamohan singh ne khaas baatcheet main pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana ke liye ap jari hone ko kisaan hit main bada kadam bataaya or pradhanmantri krishi sinchai yojana main maujuud bhrashtachar dur karne par jor diya
 Here are the highlights of the conversation: Ever since you sat on the chair of Agriculture Minister, there was a crisis on four crops, how are you dealing with this challenge?: When the government came, the country received minus 10 percent rainfall
 hamane turant 500 jilon ke liye contigency plan banaaya or rajyon ko muhaiyaa karaayaa
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself took initiative and provided state aid on diesel, fodder, horticulture and everything else
 iskaa asar yah hua ki buaai main maatr 3-4 fisadi kii kami ai
 We were able to deal with the big disaster
 prah lekin is kharif main to 14 fisadi kam barish hui he?uh is baar to 14 se 20 fisadi kam he
 We have provided contingency plans to 600 districts
 93 tarah ke sokhaarodhi beej uplabdh karaae hai
 The peasants worked hard, the states supported
 parinaam kya he, aaj dekhen ki mote anaaj ke utpaadan main chah fisadi kii vruddhi hui he
 The sowing of pulses will either be equal to last season or may be higher
 rabi kii buaai main is samay tak maatr teen fisadi kii kami he
 The situation is much better than what was sowing deficiency
 prah lekin yah kya vajah he ki jab rabi kii fasal par sankat khadaa ho gaya he, tab kharif main pade sookhe kaa jayja lene kendriya timen ja rahi hai?uh rajya main aapadaa aati he to har rajya kepas rajya aapadaa kosh main paisa rahata he
 The state also has money in other items to help
 kosh ke kuch norms hai, uske aadhaar par rajya sookhaa ghoshit karata he
 If compared with the previous governments, in the four years from 2010-11 to 2013-14, the states have asked the central government for disaster relief for Rs 1 lakh crore
 maange, jabaki rajyon ko sirf 13,762 karod ru
 Were given
 varsh 2014-15 main rajyon ne aapadaa kosh se 42,000 karod ru
 While we asked for Rs 9,000 crore
 or zyada die
 11,742 crores from NDRAF till 21 January this year as well
 die ja chuke hai
 How different is the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme from the existing insurance scheme? Suppose the farmer gets Rs
 30,000
 kii fasal ugaata he to uski fasal kaa 30,000 ru
 Will be insured agar fasal kharaab hoti he to use puraa clem milanaa chahie
 It was in the previous government that the government used to reduce the insurance amount to save its share premium
 jaise kisi kisaan ne beemaa to karaayaa 30,000 ru
 Of Rs
 12,000 but in reality the premium was reduced to Rs
 12,000
 kaa
 This was due to the government capping the premium, now this cap has been abolished
 prah fasal ko nuksaan ke akalan ke puraane tareekon ko jari rakhkar, nuksaan kaa akalan teji se kaise hoga?uh ham har lekhpal ko smart phone de rahe hai, mobile ap ke sahare 25 fisadi clem to turant milegaa
 Are we using drones and satellites? Our mobile app has been created
 do teen din main guideline chali jaaegi
 Will be sent to all states
 prah ap dena ek cheez he or smart phone dena duusari cheez he
 Like i have a smart phone, in which i can download your app
 to pehle lekhpal ke paas smart phone to pahunche tabhi to ap kaam karegaa
 A: We have to give smart phones, money is with us, which will be given to the states
 smart phone dena aasaan he, ap bananaa kathin he, jo ban chukaa he
 Q: In the coming kharif season, crop insurance will be provided with app based technology ?: You write that the app has been released
 ham isse teji se soochna mangaayenge
 If there is no smart phone, then we also know how to use the app
 to agar ap jari kiya he or lekhpal ke paas smart phone nahin hoga tab to ap bekaar he
 If the app has been released and will not give a smart phone, is the Indian government so foolish
 smartphone main iskaa istemaal ho isiilie to ap diya he
 Q: If you have so much confidence in this app, then tell me that in case of any crisis in procurement 2016, in how many days the farmer will get his insurance claim ?: It depends on how fast the state governments Cooperate with us
 rajya sarkarein jis anupaat main sahyog karengi, usee anupaat main parinaam aaenge
 Q: So what will the farmer get new in the name of insurance in this kharif? A: In the event of disaster in the middle of the crop season, he will get 25% insurance claim immediately, this will be seen from this kharif season

 The tweet started when Manish Tiwari shared a video related to Narendra Modi

 Sharing this video did not go down well with Modi followers and one man reprimanded Manish Tiwari in inflammatory language

 But they seem to have been asked by Congress' semi-literate leaders to do the same

 The BJP as well as the leftist CPI also condemned Manish Tiwari's statements and urged politicians to introduce decency in social and political life

 The Congress has been in power for so many years and Manish Tiwari is a lawyer, former information broadcasting minister and one of the official spokespersons of the Congress

 lekin is shahar ke jism par isaki jis aadat ne sabase zyada jakhm die hai, wo he yahaan ke logon kaa aslhon se lagaav
 The sizzlers of Muzaffarnagar district, who are happy to join their ties with legitimate and illegitimate weapons and seek status symbols among the slaves, will stop with time, but no one knows when and how this hunger of the slums will stop
 nazaij aslhon kii factory kii sachai
 
 
 Ever since this bloodbath started in Muzaffarnagar, the factory has been spewing more and more weapons in a closed-door death factory
 yani jitne zyada hathiyaar utani moti kamai
 It is obvious that a few people's livelihood is also run by factories
 lekin jab isi factory se nikalne vaale hathiyaaron kaa munh khulata he, to phir jo ek cheez insaan ke haath lagati he, wo he maut or sirf maut
 In fact, there are illegal arms factories in Muzaffarnagar in UP, which have placed this district on a pile of gunpowder
 mujffarnagar main nazaij aslhe kii keval ek hi factory nahin he, balki un saikadon factriyon main ek he, jo saalon se is ilaake main logon ke bich maut baantati rahi hai
 However, despite all the progress and tehzib claims, people still love the weapons in this area more than life
 hinsa kii aag main jhulase is shahar ne agar is baar 35 se zyada logon kii jindagiyaan ganvaai hai, to unamem aadhe se zyada laashon par aise hi nazaij aslhon se nikali maut kii muhar chhapi he
 The horrific pictures of Muzaffarnagar seen in a sting operation of Aaj Tak recently and now the mourning of death after the violence is actually the result of the products of these factories
 jaahir he, in factriyon kaa asar ab beshak ab dikh rahaa ho, lekin isaki jameen tabhi taiyaar ho gai thi, jab kukuramutton kii tarah ye factriyaan mujffanagar main ugti raheen or prashasan kaan main tel daal kar sota rahaa
 Every house in Muzaffarnagar has weapons
 
 
 kehete hai is desh main mujffarnagar hi wo jagah he, jahaan har gaanv or har ghar main koi naa koi hathiyaar jarur he
 Whether that weapon is legitimate or illegitimate
 lekin aslhon se yahi lagaav ab is shahar kii ganga-jamuna tahjeeb or jindagi par baari padane laga he
 That is why most of the corpses left with fresh violence have bullet marks emanating from illegitimate slaughters
 mujffarnagar kaa jila gajiabad se rishta
 
 
 After all, what is the relationship between Muzaffarnagar violence with the district Ghaziabad? Just this same question has given sleep to the laws of law these days
 or neend udne kii vajah he, gajiabad main hui kaartuson kii record bikri
 Since the violence in Muzaffarnagar, the market of bullets in Ghaziabad has become hot
 kya ye mahaj ittefaq he yaa phir kuch or?ye ittefaq yaa kuch or?ye ittefaq he yaa kuch or
 But the fact is that after the violence in Muzaffarnagar, there has been a spurt in the sale of cartridges in Ghaziabad, which has broken all the old records till date
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki mujffarnagar ko hinsa kii aag main jhonknevaale log hi to kahin gajiabad se tabadatod kaartuson kii kharid nahin kar rahe? jinka istemaal vahaan vaid or avaidh hathiyaaron main kiya ja rahaa he? isi phikr ke chalate ab gajiabad prashasan ne in bikriyon kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 Ashala has a total of 15 shops in Ghaziabad
 or inamen se aath dukaanon main kaartuson kii bikri achaanak se badi he
 Rather, it has not only increased, the most demanding is 315 bore and 12 bore cartridges
 jabaki mujffarnagar main hui hinsa main in bor ke aslhon ke istemaal kii baat bhi saamne ai he
 In such a situation, it is necessary to raise the ears of the police

 com / vmlg23m7nihope @citiznmukherjee now realises from todays' incident, how BJP dirty tricks dept operates
 Even RSS wouldn’t believe that u r going 2 endorse its views in ur speech
 But the speech will be forgotten, visuals will remain & those will be circulated with fake statements
 1 / 2
 @citiznmukherjee By going 2 Nagpur, ur giving BJP / RSS full handle 2 plant false stories, spread falls rumors as 2day & making it somewhat believable
 And this is just d beginning! 2 / 2 T20 World Cup opposing teams should now be careful! Because Captain Cool MS Dhoni of Team India is already fit and ready to put on a show of fours and sixes
 practice seshan main dhoni ne amit mishra kii 10 gendon par 6 chakke or 4 chauke jadte hue 52 ran thok daale
 The way Dhoni was playing Mishra's balls, it seemed as if he was giving these messages to the selectors as to why he did not want to keep this leg-spinner from Haryana in the playing eleven
 dhoni ne jo amit mishra ke saath kiya vaisaa hi kuch purv captain saurav ganguli murali karthik ke saath kar chuke hai
 Many believe that Karthik's Test career was limited to only eight matches because Ganguly never had trouble playing him at the nets
 ganguli ne gharelu maichon main kai baar karthik kii gendon kii dhunaai kii
 Apart from this, when Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh are in the team, Ganguly never found Kartik a good option in domestic or foreign situations
 team india england ke khilaaf hone vaale tii20 world cap ke practice match se pehle buudhvaar ko jab abhyaas ke liye ai to dhoni kaa mishra ke prati ravaiya kuch isi tarah kaa laga
 Some sixes went to the cow corner (mid-wicket area) and some went directly above the bowler's head
 kuch shot deep extra cover or long of par gaye
 Mishra could not trouble Dhoni at any point
 dhoni pichley practice seshan or pehle practice match main ballebaaji nahin kar paae the isliye bhartiya captain ne aaj tej gendbaajon or spinneron donon kaa saamana kiya
 In the sweltering heat of the afternoon, most of the players looked tired
 ek senior ballebaaj ne pavilion lautate samay kaha ki krij par samay bitaana bahut mushkil he

 Shiv Sena Party chief Uddhav Thackeray has been angry with the Maharashtra government over the issue of helping farmers
 uddhav ne rajya kii sarkaar kisaanon kii madad karne main kam padane kii baat kah kar nayaa bavaal paidaa kiya he
 The Shiv Sena joined it a month after the BJP came to power in Maharashtra
 is sarkaar main shivasena ke paas kisaanon kii samasya se jude kisi bhi vibhaag kaa cabinet mantripad nahin he
 In such a situation, the Shiv Sena's party chief, who was forced to play a secondary role in the government, also made it clear that he would continue to highlight the shortcomings of the government
 aisa nahin kii sarkaar main shaamil hue to sab kuch badhiya kehete rahenge
 ' uddhav ne mumbai main sanvadadaataaon se baat karte hue kaha ki sarkaar ke kisaan raahat kii ghoshnaaon kaa asar dekhne ke liye vah rajya ke suukhaagrast ilaake kaa daura bhi karenge
 Marathwada and Vidarbha in Maharashtra are struggling with shortage of water during the winter season

 The state government announced a package of seven and a half thousand crores to provide relief from this
 rajya main barkaraar kisaan aatmahatya rokane ke liye kisaan par chadhe sahuukaar ke karje chukaane kaa bhi faisla liya he
 These decisions were announced when the Shiv Sena had joined the state government
 rajya ke kisaanon kii madad ke liye apane plan kaa elaan karne ke maukey par uddhav ne kaha ki ve mumbai kii prasiddh jahangir art gailaree main mangalvaar se khud ke dwaara khinche gaye tasveeron kii pradarshnee laga rahe hai or in tasveeron ko bechakar honevaali aamadani ko ve rajyabar main kisaan raahat ke kaamon ke liye istemaal karenge
 Apart from politics, Uddhav is also interested in professional photography
 isi baat ko pakadakar ensipi ne shivasena party pramukh uddhav thakare par taana ksaa he
 Speaking to NDTV India in Mumbai, the party's national spokesperson Nawab Malik said that Uddhav Thackeray is shedding crocodile tears over the farmers' problems
 satta main shaamil shivasena ko kisaanon kii vednaa se sarokaar nahin
 The state government should provide a package of Rs 10,000 crore for farmer relief
 baharhaal, satta main sahyogi dal se hui tikhi tippanee se rajya bijepi sakate main he
 Party sources say that by not reacting to Uddhav's statement, he will try to maintain mutual harmony
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah aaj rajasthan kii rajdhani jaipur main aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaariyon kii samiksha karenge
 Shah is visiting the state for the first time after the appointment of state party president Madan Lal Saini

 Let me tell you that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has conceived the Rajasthan assembly elections
 assamit shahjaipur main chunaav kii ranneeti banane aa rahe hai
 The biggest challenge for Shah is to change the trend of power change in Rajasthan every five years

 Advocates of all the district courts of Delhi were on strike today
 haalanki is baar kii hadtaal kai maamalon main pichhali hadataalon se alag thi
 The strike was not in the court premises but outside the office of the Bar Council of India
 hadtaal isliye thi ki vakeelon ko hadtaal se na roka jaae
 It is definitely strange to hear but also interesting
 baar council of india ne do hafte pehle lau kamishan ko apana suzav bheja tha ki vakil bina vajah ke hadtaal par jate hai to unke khilaaf karrwai kii jaae
 If the people involved in the trial are harmed by their strike, then the penalty should be recovered from the lawyers
 ye penlti 3 se 5 lakh ke bich ho sakati he
 Apart from this, there are some other suggestions
 vakeelon keregistration ko suspendkarna bhi inamen shaamil he
 On the issue of ending the strike, the Bar Council says that they will again write to the Law Commission to withdraw the recommendations
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki baar concil of india ne dilli kii sabhi jila adaalaton kii koordination cameti se raay liye bina suzav sidhe lau kamishan ko bhej die he
 If the Law Commission accepts these suggestions and changes the Act of 1961, then it will become law
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki jab sarkari karmchaaree se lekardoctor or teachrajise profeshnal hadtaal kar sakate hai to phir vakeelon par hi pabandi kyon
 The Bar Council of India is opposing the suggestions sent by the Law Commission
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne baar council of india se achaanak vakeelon ke strike par jane ke maamle par lau kamishan ko suzav dene ko kaha tha
 The Supreme Court had told the Bar Council that a sudden strike causes a lot of damage
 lihaaja ise roka janaa chahie
 This causes harm to the common people fighting the case
 suzav main barcouncil of indiyane kaha he ki vakeelon ke achaanak hadtaal par jane par unka license radd kiya jaae
 Apart from this, penalty is also being imposed on them
 is suzav ke virodh main jila koordination cameti or baar council ke baahar vakeelon ne virodh pradarshan kiya

 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa or uske pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee narendra modi ke khilaaf congress raajnneetik sangharsh main apane ko behad bouna or kamjor mahasoos kar rahi he
 The Congress is resorting to propaganda and legal bets and punishments against them, but the Congress is also losing in the legal battle
 unhone kaha ki congress aaj se nahin kai saalon se, modi ko vot bank raajnneeti ke chalate badnaam karne main lagi hui he
 Rajnath said that what happened in Gujarat in 2002 was very sad but in some ways the efforts made by the then state government to stop these riots cannot be any other example
 gujarat sarkaar dwaara danga bhadakne ke baad kii gayi prabhavi karrwai ke baavjood aaj tak congress kii god main khel rahe sanghathanon ke dwaara jis jis prakaar ke bhi aarope lagaaye gayi, unki jaanch ke liye gujarat sarkaar ne puraa sahyog kiya
 Several prominent accused were also punished severely
 modi kii pairvi karte hue unhone kaha ki jis dhang se vigat 11 varshon se congress modi ke peeche padi he, vah sarvatha anuchit he
 If the court acquits in one case, then the government keeps some prapancha ready while on the other hand how many people have been punished by the Congress till date in the 1984 riots? On the contrary, their leaders even put a 'closure report' by the CBI
 rajnath ne kaha ki unhen bharat kii janata kii paripakvata or vivek par puraa bharosa he ki vah aisi kisi paristhiti ko janm nahin degi balki desh kii sabhi samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karne main samaksh narendra modi ke netritv main bhaajapa ko nirnaayak takat degi
 The BJP has a solution to all these problems
 bhaajapa desh ke samaksh prastut samasyaon ke nidaan ke liye sushasan, vikaas, sthirataa or suraksha muhaiyaa karaayegi

 pesh he is kitaab ke kuch ansh
 
 
 It was a Fundamentalist school
 yahan doobe maath saab course ke hisaab se jab bhi prem par kuch 'intens'-sa padhaayaa karte, to hameshaa yahi kehete the ki prastut panktiyaan aatma or paramatma ke milan ko bayaan karte hue kahi gai hai
 No matter how naked, naked, and unafraid of kissing her beloved on the pages of the page, the laundries were always tricked into thinking that the 'soul' in the lines presented wanted them to shatter ' Into the divine
 ekaakaar ho jaae
 Simply, 'ultimatally' get rid of the cycle of life and death
 aise main, class main do tarah ke bachche hua karte the
 One who, while sitting at the threshold of his teenagerie, was courting the white chickens of his dreams, and was very understanding that the fire which the 'dead soul' had suffered when he saw the arms of the divine i am able to absorb aatma jo na pani se geeli ho sakati he or na aag se jal sakati he, wo aashiqui kya ghanta karegi! duusari tarah ke bachche wo hua karte the jo sach main haath jodakar bhare man se ye prarthana kar rahe hote the ki aatma or paramatma kaa milan kisi tarah bas ho hi jaae
 He would also interpret the last scene of the train of 'dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' in a similar way that Amrish Puri here is a symbol of 'maya of the world' and Kajol is a replica of 'atma'
 ho-na-ho shahrukh 'paramatma' he
 In the last scene of the film, when Amrish Puri leaves Kajol's hand and says - 'ja Simran, live your life
 ' tab ye saafe ho bhi gaya tha ki wo train rupi alokik-asansaarik yatra ke madhyam se, maaya se haath chhudwakar, aatma ko paramatma se milane ke liye bhej rahaa tha
 These other types of children were very innocent
 lekin doobe ji kii pehali tarah ke bacchon se hameshaa fatty rahati thi
 Because gahe-bahega used to stand up and ask - 'mahat Saab, what sweet and sweet pain is he talking about through the poet's soul in the words presented
 maane dard to thik baat he maath saab, lekin ye koun prakaar kaa dard he jo meetha-meetha-sa lagata he?'doobe ji bhi khub bhale maanas the
 Used to answer the children's curiosity a lot
 misaal ke taur par, is sawaal ke jawaab main unhone neem kii pandrah bent vinod ke pichhawaade par sont-sont ke maari
 And said- 'now this is happening on your backyard, isn't it a sweet pain
 jo aatma ko aksar hua karata he
 Are you now able to understand, son or not? Vinod was one of the classiest boys in our class
 isliye maine man-hi-man use apana guru maan liya tha
 For me, humor was the ray of hope that could transform me from a 'second kind' child to a 'first kind' child
 main pehali tarah kaa baccha isliye ho janaa chahta tha kyonki mujhe pyaar ho chalaa tha or main nahin chahta tha ki meraa pyaar bhi aatma-paramatma vaala bakawaas pyaar rah jaae
 We all knew that Vinod was the only boy in the whole class who had a girlfriend
 haalaanki, vinod use item, funti yaa maal kahalwanaa pasand karata tha
 But i did not like to say so
 kyonki main nahin chahta ki kal ko shruti meri garlfriend bane or koi use maal kahe
 i had already decided that i would call him 'janu'
 main bhugol ke boring period main apni kalpana main shruti ko janu kehane kaa abhyaas kiya karata
 And after so much thinking, my face map would change
 mujhe ye soch kar romaanch ho jaataa ki agar shruti ne palatakar mujhe bhi janu kah diya to mere badan ke shushk marusthal par uski awaz kii nam pachua pawan takaraakar, mausam kaa pehla monsoon le aegi
 There, where not a single drop of rain has fallen till today, there will be torrential rain today and the green dung of the cherished plains of Cherrapunji will bloom in the desert of my body
 shruti ne bhi hath pakad lee thi
 She would be a part of my brain in every period
 jaise wo mujhase kahana chaah rahi ho ki main kyon uske paas pahunchakar usase baat nahin karata
 That day was over when Shruti Lucy came to English class after class of Geography
 wiliam vardsaworth kii kavita kii ek-ek line main lusi kaa chithran, hu-ba-hu shruti se miltaa tha
 After English, co-ordinate geometry was taught that day in a mathematics class
 shruti vahaan bhi thi
 In the rise and rise of parabola and ellipse
 vahaan main bhi tha
 By being asymptote
 treepathi maath sa'ba ne bataaya ki acimptot wo line hoti he jo parabola ko anant par jaakar milti he
 My heartbeats became sudden and rapid
 mujhase rahaa nahin gaya or maine haath khadaa kiya
 ' head?' 'yes boy, say what is the question?' 'what is meeting at infinity?' To meet at infinity means to meet at infinity
 ' ' haan to maath sa'ba, infinity par milanaa kya hota he?' ' infinity par milanaa matlab anant par milanaa
 'tripathi ji said screaming
 ' sar aap samaj nahin rahe hai
 i have understood that infinity means infinite
 lekin ye ‘milanaa’ kya hota he?' ' pagalaa gaye ho kya balak? bina baat dimaag karaab kar rahe ho
 Come here and become a rooster
 ' ' sar aap to bila vajah naaraaz ho rahe hai
 i asked a question in my mind
 ''sawaal gaya baba ji kii langoti main
 Now come here and make a straight cock or not? 'how was it to meet on Infinity, sir! In this way, the Asymptote will never meet the parabola
 sidhe-sidhe aap ye kyon nahin kah dete ki darasal donon kabhi milte hi nahin hai
 It just seems that the two are meeting somewhere
 ' maine murga bane hue ghutanon ke bich se treepathi ji ko ghoorte hue, dukhi man se jawaab diya
 My heart was broken
 saath main meri taangen bhi
 The real idea of how painful it is to be a cock continuously for half an hour is when you come back from the cuddled vagina to the human vagina
 chalanaa shuru karte hi ghutanon kii gend gravity or friction se jhagadna shuru karti hai jisamen bich-bich main aisa mahasoos hota he ki abhi achaanak ghutanon kii donon genden pop karke baahar aa jaayengi
 Even if Newton saw the apple falling, Gravity must have said hello
 lekin gravity se hamaari namaste to treepathi maath sa'ba ne hi karai thi
 If Shruti was in my class at this time, she would have been sad to see me become a cock
 wo mere class kii ladakiyon kii tarah nirmam or shailo nahin thi jo mujhe murga bane dekhakar honton par rumal lagaakar hans rahi thim
 In particular, she was not at all like Priyanka Singhania and Isha Kapoor, who had more to be Singhania and Kapoor than Gurur was in English with her beauty and accent

 Despite the projected to get twenty-one seats more, it seems that the Congress will not be able to stop the Bharatiya Janata Party from forming a government for the third time in Madhya Pradesh
 india today samooh-si voter ke surveykshan ke mutabik november main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main kul 230 siton main se bijepi ko 122 siten mil sakati hai
 It will form the government with a lower but decisive majority than before
 surveykshan kaa kahana he ki 2008 kii 71 siton ke mukaable congress ko 92 siten milengi
 The BJP had 143 seats in the last election
 philhal congress ke 65 vidhayak hai
 In the last two years, the party has lost all by-elections in the assembly
 uske sadsy or vipaksh ke upanetaa choudhary rakesh singh chaturvedi pichley dinon bijepi main shaamil ho gaye
 Despite this, the Congress will gain 27 seats in the next election
 congress ke voton main 2008 ke 32 fisadi ke mukaable 4 fisadi kaa oochaal aayega or use 36 fisadi vot milane kaa anumaan he jabaki bijepi ek fisadi ijaphe ke saath 39 fisadi vot hasil karegi
 Although the Congress will not be able to form a government, these results of the survey are enough to wake the ruling party from sleep
 bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ko pichley chunaav se ek seat kam yani sirf 6 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 Its vote percentage will also come down to 8 per cent
 rajnatik prekshkon ko maananaa he ki uttar pradesh main satta se baahar hone par bispi kii siten nahin badhatin
 The loss of one percent of his vote will be beneficial for other parties and independents
 pichley chunaav main unhen 9 siten mili thim lekin is baar 10 kaa anumaan he
 According to the survey, BJP is projected to get 117 to 127, Congress 87 to 97, BSP 4 to 6, and others 8 to 10 seats
 bijepi mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii lokapriyata ko bhunaa rahi he
 Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia has a popularity of just 24 per cent as against Chauhan's 57 per cent rating
 bijepi ho yaa congress, donon kaa koi anya netaa 5 fisadi se upar jaataa nahin dikh rahaa
 Under Chauhan's leadership, the party is confident of hat-trick
 13 agast ko chouhan apni jan aashirwad yatra par rajya ke mandsaur jile ke shyamgarh main pahunche to sadakon ke kinare jamaa bheed ne unka jabardast utsaah se swaagat kiya
 Slogans like, "storm is not a storm, Shivraj Singh is Chauhan
" ” unhone ab tak kii apni 1, 329 kimi kii is yatra main ab tak 48 vidhansabha kshetron main 120 sabhaaon ko sambodhit kiya he
 Encouraged by the support being received in the yatra, Chauhan says, "the enthusiasm of the public shows that the BJP will return to power with immense support
" janata sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se behad khush he
 However, Leader of Opposition in Madhya Pradesh Assembly Ajay Singh rejects the latest survey
 ve kehete hai, ''november main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi satta se baahar hogi
 "they allege that money is being shed like water to make the Jan Ashirwad Yatra a success
 chunaav main sirf teen maheene bache hai
 Both Congress and BJP are trying hard to improve their performance
 kuch maujuuda vidhayakon ko badla bhi ja saktaa he
 The Congress has sent observers in various assembly segments, who will read the pulse of the public and take applications from the ticket holders, the BJP is also sending senior leaders to assess the ground reality before the candidates are announced
 is chunaav main ummidavaar khadey karne ke maamle main donon partiyaan koi jokhim nahin le rahi
 Chauhan: Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan is the bjp's mascot in this election as well
 lokapriyata ke maamle main congress main unka koi sani nahin he
 The Congress appears to be devoid of leadership
 chouhan kii 57 fisadi lokapriyata ko bhaanpakar hi congress un par nishane saadh rahi he
 His attempt is to surround Chauhan in Budhni assembly constituency
 sihor jile main unke vidhansabha kshetra ke antargat nasrullaganj main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf congress jabardast pradarshan kar rahi he
 Leader of the Opposition Ajay Singh has made personal allegations of corruption against Chauhan, his wife and relatives
 jawaab main chouhan ne un par manahani kaa daawa thonka he
 Before the elections, the Congress is attacking them for harassing the Chief Minister
 chouhan duusari baar vidhansabha chunaav main party kaa netritv kar rahe hai, to bijepi hetric lagane kii ore agrasar he
 Scindia: Union State Power Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia's popularity is 24 per cent
 yah un logon ke liye buree khabar ho sakati he jo lambey samay se maang kar rahe hai ki congress unhen mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kare
 However, other factions of the party are in opposition
 party ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he ki pichley saal se hi congress hikeman sindhiya ko rajya chunaav prachaar samiti kaa mukhiya banane kii soch rahaa he lekin duusare khemon kii taraf se kade virodh ke kaaran duvidha main he
 Digvijay Singh: The popularity of former Congress Chief Minister Digvijay Singh has been mentioned in the survey only 3 percent
 lagata he, madhya pradesh kii janata ne digvijay ko abhi tak na bhulaayaa he or na maaf kiya he
 Nine years ago, he had to relinquish power due to misrule and poor infrastructure
 2003 ke vidhansabha chunaav main logon ne unke poster phaade or reliyon main patharav bhi kiya
 Kamal Nath: Union Minister Kamal Nath's popularity was just 2 per cent
 unka prabhutv mahakaushal ilaake main mana jaataa he lekin aisa lagata he ki dilli main vyast hone ke kaaran kamalnath ke samarthakon ne unhen bhula diya he
 Gaur: In the current government, Babulal Gaur, a minister and former BJP chief minister, has 1 percent popularity
 lagaataar 9 baar se bhopal main govindpura seat par jeet rahe bijepi ummidavaar gaur rajya ke anya hisson main utane lokapriy nahin lagate hai
 Kantilal Bhuria: The state Congress president has not lost a single election in the last 32 years
 unki 1 fisadi lokapriyata se sabit hota he ki adivasee bhi unhen pasand nahin karte
 The state has a significant number of tribals
 chouhan kii badhati lokapriyata unhen kendriya raajnneeti main modi ke mukaable majboot daavedaar ke taur par khadaa kar rahi he
 But before that, Chauhan would also like to show his stamina in the state's hat-trick of BJP, which is being seen as an ace of BJP leader LK Advani's trump

 In view of this, Indian boxing officials have asked Sports Authority of India (sai) Director General, Ingeeti Srinivas to be prepared for the worst situation
 kayaason ke mutabik vijender jald hi profeshnal boxing main apane padaarpan kii ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 If Vijender does this then he will be disqualified to represent India

 Because Vijender has strong competition in the weight category, he has also been selected for the Government of India's Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS)
 is skim main chune jane ke baad bhi unhone ab tak sarkaar se paise nahin liye hai or apane kharche par hi training kar rahe hai
 It is also being speculated that Vijender is fed up with governmental neglect and at the same time the glare of professional boxing is pulling him towards him
 sach kya he ye to somvaar ko hi saamne aayega
 Till then we can only wait and pray that Vijender keep playing for India and also win the gold medal in Rio 2016 Olympics

 Despite all this, still mystery
 puraa desh ek shahari parivaar main is vicitra aparaadh katha kii har baariki par najar rakhata rahaa he
 But, in the end, such a decision came, which was heard in just two minutes, which raised more questions
 court ne aarushi talwaar ke maa-baap ko doshi maanate hue 26 november, 2013 ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai
 Both were then sent to Dasna jail to learn, the story of the night of the assassination
 Difficulty in analyzing the chance-a-case for a crime expert - areas of doubt, such as its geography, sociology, history, popular culture, or employment methods
 -it is due to lack of information
 aise main koi aparaadh visheshgy apni jaankaree ke anusaar hi samajhadaar yaa naasamajh ho saktaa he
 The analysis of crime in the aarushi-hemraj murder case is still dependent on circumstantial evidence
 isliye samay bitne ke saath itane tarah kii kahaniyaan or vishleshan aa gaye ki is gutthi kii har kadi isaki samiksha karne vaale ke nazariye main feet baith jaati he
 According to the CBI, the condition of the parents' involvement in the crime indicates that they could not explain why the lock of Aarushi's room was open that night
 yahi sawaal maa-baap ke jehan main bhi tha ki aakhir us raat chaabi kyon bhul aae
 Judge Shyam Lal also wrote in his judgment, 'the accused gave no answer as to how and who opened the lock of Aarushi's room
 ' lekin noopur ke mutabik, vah unke jivan kii sabase badi bhul thi
 He said, 'I probably left the key in the door that night
 ' mauka-e-vaardaat noida ke jalwaayu vihaar main talwaar parivaar kaa ghar tha
 The Talwar family lived in a two-bedroom flat on the second floor
 is flats main kai daravaaje or khidkiyaan thim
 It had an iron grill door with a wooden door and then an exterior iron grill door
 hemraj kaa cameraa flats ke andar hi mukhya dwaar ke thik bagal main tha
 The roof also belonged to the Talwar family whose staircase used to go from the outside common area
 aarushi kaa cameraa dayee ore uske maa-baap ke kamare ke bagal main tha
 His room was locked every night from outside
 hemraj ke paas aarushi ke kamare ko chhodkar sabhi chaabiyaan rahati thim
 Here a few sutras open that bother you
 to, us raat kya hua hoga? jo pataa he, vah is prakaar he

 It is on his mind that there is only two more days to go to school and then there is a big birthday party, the celebration will be held till late night on May 19
 uski maa kamare main ‘internet kaa batan chaalu karne ke liye aati he
 Rajesh's laptop was not running, so he wanted to work for a while on the computer kept in Aarushi's room
 rajesh talwaar kuch email bhejte rahe or maa-beti baaten karti raheen
 Then they left and forgot to lock the door of Aarushi's room from outside like every night
 taarikh- 16 may, 2008din- buudhvarasmay- subah 6 bajehar subah ghar main kaam karne vaali bharti ghanti bajaati to hemraj uske liye darwaja kholta tha
 But that did not happen that morning
 vah baar-baar ghanti or lohe ke bahari gril ko bhi baja rahi thi
 Finally, Nupur opens the wooden door with folded eyes and asks the iron grill inside, where is Hemraj? Bharti says, 'I don't know
 kya aap chaabi neeche phenk dengi?' jab vah ai to dekha ki baahar lohe kaa gril band nahin he
 But the inner grill door is locked from the outside
 vah jab ghar main ghusi to rajesh or noopur ro rahe the
 Nupur fell from her chest and cried, 'go to Aarushi's room and see what happened
 ' bharti andar jaati he or noopur jab chadar hataati he to bharti ko aarushi ke gale par khun kii patali dhar dikhti he
 Nupur is crying, 'look what Hemraj did
 ' bharti puuchhati he, 'padosiyon ko bulaauun?' noopur kahati he, 'haa, bulaao
 'time- 6 in the morning
 50 bajebuudhvaar kii subah 6
 Police arrives by 50 pm and media by 8 pm
 aarushi kaa shav postmortem ke liye kareeb 9 baje le jaaya jaataa he
 The horrific blunders of some individuals led to mass mess

 Gautam took countless photographs and fingerprints that morning
 phir bhi 24 main se 22 finger print kii tasviren dhundhlee hai, unke 23 photo negative se mail nahin khate
 He has no picture of blood-soaked footprints on the roof, where Hemraj's body was found as there was a large crowd and no pictures of blood-stained glass whiskey fingerprints match the finger prints of anyone

 At the point of a policeman, they think of investigating the flat
 sawaal uthta he ki hemraj ke kamare main sula wine, kingfisher bear or sprite kii teen bottlen kyon padi hai? teen glasson kaa maamla kya he? hemraj kaa bistar aise muda-tuda kyon he ki maano teen log us par baithe hon? hemraj ke bathroom main itani peshaab kyon he?ek hi tareeke se kaata galaave khun ke dhabbe lagi sidhippon se chat par jate hai
 There we are surprised to see that the roof has impressions of blood-stained hands, there is red water like blood in the cooler and a corpse is found rotting in the corner, there are the same marks on the head as Aarushi had on her head and both of them The larynx was also cut in the same manner
 sharir par ghaavon ke kai nishaan hai
 He says, 'after being in harsh sunlight for two days in the heat of May, the body was in such a condition that even Rajesh could not identify Hemraj

 He said that the character of both father and daughter were weak

 Rajesh heard voices in Aarushi's room, found Hemraj on Aarushi's bed and angrily slashed both of them with a golf stick

 India today conducted two experimental tests of two Prithvi-2 missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads within an hour from the Integrated Test Site (ITR) at Chandipur off the Orissa coast

 He said that during today's experimental trials, the entire launch path was monitored through modern radar electro-optic telemetry centers and ships in the impact point area of bay of Bengal
 ’isi prakshepan parisar se 24 sitambar 2010 ko bhi ek praayogic pareekshan kiya gaya tha lekin us dauraan missile kuch takneekee khaamiyon kii vajah se apane kaushal pradarshan main naakaam rahi
 An Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) official said that the Prithvi-2 missile has been successful in proving its capability and accuracy repeatedly in pre-tests

 But this party was Semadhuri Dixitnadar
 khabar he ki subhash ghai kii favorit list main kabhi rahane vaali maadhuri dikshit ko subhash ghai ne party ke liye inwite hi nahin kiya he
 From today, Madhuri Dixit and Deepika Padukone have spoken about the heart Kisubhash Ghai

 When asked the reason, Subhash Ghai said that we did not call Madhuri because the biggest problem with women is that she does not walk alone

 While the heroes just pick up the bags and come

 puraani dilli ke chandani chowk ilaake main sthit kinari bazaar main bheeshan aag lag jane kii khabar he, jisaki chapet main 20 se 25 dukaane ai bataai ja rahi hai
 According to initial reports, the fire was caused by a power transformer, and spread rapidly

 At present, there is no news of any known loss
 dilli fire sarvice ke nideshak eke sharma ke anusaar, "shuruaati sandesh transformar ke aag pakad lene kaa hi tha
 
 
 Later the fire became of medium grade
 
 
 ham logon ne 25 gaadiyaan bheji thim
 
 
 Old Delhi is a crowded commercial area, where the streets are very narrow
 
 
 " On the other hand, according to an eyewitness, "the fire was caused by a transformer
 
 
 har hafte aisa hota hi rahata he, bas, aaj unhone dhyaan diya he
 
 
 The power department is responsible for this
 
 
 " Due to the narrow streets, fire brigade personnel are finding it very difficult to extinguish the fire and relief operations, and people living in the neighborhood are also seen pouring water into the buckets from the roofs of their homes
 modi sarkaar dwaara aarakshan ko catagarijeshan ke liye banaae gaye kamishan par samaajawaadee party ke pravaktaa sunil saajan ne kaha ki modi kii netritv vaali sarkaar angrejon kii tarj par obisi ko aapas main baantkar raajnneeti karnaa chaahati he
 He is not serious about the interests of obcs, just for his political benefit, a commission has been created by SP MLC Sunil Sajan to create a rift between the OBC society
 in se baat karte hue kaha ki jatigat janaganana ho chuki he, use saarvajanik karne ke bajaaeobisi samaajako hi baantne kii disha main modi sarkaar kaam kar rahi he
 The Modi government is following in the same footsteps as the British have adopted the rule of divide and rule in society
 yahi vajah he ki unhone kendriya sevaaon main obisi jatiyon ko mil rahe aarakshan ko baantne kii manshaa se cote main kota talashne ke liye kamishan ko manjuuri di he
 Whereas our party has been saying from the beginning that by making the caste census public today, the society which has a share should be given as much reservation
 saajan ne kaha ki modi sarkaar yadav or kurmi samaaj ko lagaataar target kar rahi he
 Through this commission, they are also targeting both these societies, so that all the castes of OBC can stand against Yadav and Kurmi
 sarkaar ko lagata he ki obisi kuch jatiyaan saamaajik or shaikshanik rup se peeche rah gai hai to uske liye koi thos kadam uthaae
 But the government will not do this work, rather it intends to take its political advantage by creating a rift in the middle of the society
 iske bahaane vah bahes karana chaahati he phir dhire se aarakshan hi khatm dene kii manshaa paal rakhi he
 BJP leaders have expressed their intention to abolish reservation several times
 railway gambhir vittiya sankat kaa boj jhel rahi he
 In such a situation, the number of announcement of new trains is expected to be less than 100 in the Railway Budget for the financial year 2015-16
 yah aamtaur par prayek saal hone vaali ghoshnaaon se kaaphi kam he
 Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu is considered a pro-reformer
 mana ja rahaa he ki prabhu rail bajet main kai rajyon kii maang ke baavjood adhik nai trainon kii ghoshnaa nahin karenge, kyonki kosh kii kami se railway kaa kaaphi kaam barason se atka hua he
 Usually 150 to 180 new trains are announced every year in the Rail Budget
 pichley saal hi kareeb 160 nai trainon kii ghoshnaa hui thi
 According to sources, Prabhu may take a different stand in this matter and he will probably not announce more new trains in his first Rail Budget speech
 haalanki, saal ke dauraan aage chalakar vah aisa kar sakate hai
 Sources said that after assessing the profit loss of not announcing more new trains in the Rail Budget, the revised proposal has now been pushed forward
 isamen bahut simit sankhya main nai trainon kii ghoshnaa hogi
 Apart from this, branding of some trains can also be done to raise additional funds
 prastaav ke anusaar in trainon par kuch lokapriy brandon ke vigyaapan lage honge
 They can also be named as Coca Cola Express or Haldiram Express etc
 iske alaava rail bajet main kuch lokapriy margon par duusari shrenee ke kochon ke saath kuch anarakshit trainon jaise ‘jan saadhaaran express’ aadi kii ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 This offer can be extended to the common man for cheaper travel
 rail bajet sansad main 26 farvari ko pesh kiya jayega
 The acquisition of about 20 trains sets can also be proposed in the Rail Budget 2015-16
 ye trainen lokapriy rajdhani va shatabdi ke margon par chalaai jaaengi
 In view of the assembly elections in Bihar, trains may be announced there
 iske alaava purvottar ke liye bhi nai trainon kii ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 It is believed that efforts will be made to establish regional balance with the announcement of new trains for states like Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bengal and Gujarat

 Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems expensive for Congress MP Shashi Tharoor
 kerala congress ke adhyaksh mullapalli ramchandran ke baad party ke varisht netaa or saansad ke muralidharan ne tharur ke bayaan par naaraazgi jataai he
 Muralitharan said that the party in Kerala is very dissatisfied with him (shashi Tharoor)
 unhone kaha ki narendra modi kii tarif karke koi congress main kaise rah saktaa he
 If Modi is to be praised, Tharoor should join BJP
 saansad ke muralidharan ne shashi tharur ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii maang karte hue kaha ki narendra modi kii mahimamandan karne waalon ko congress main rahane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 He said, 'I too once criticized the Congress, but at that time i left the party
 'muralidharan ne kaha ki party main koi bhi pad praapt karne vaale kisi bhi congress sadsy ko party ke niyamon kaa paalan karnaa hoga
 If he does not do so, he should be out of the party
 unhone kaha ki tharur ke paas karunakaran parivaar kii aalochana karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 Let me tell you that Muralitharan is the son of senior Congress leader and late Chief Minister Karunakaran
 kerala congress adhyaksh ramchandran kaa bayantharur ke bayaan ko lekar kerala main congress ke adhyaksh mullapalli ramchandran ne kaha tha ki congress shashi tharur ke is bayaan ko sweekaar nahin karegi
 He said, 'we have decided to seek answers from Shashi Tharoor

 At the moment, Tharoor is abroad
 tharur ke spashtikaran ke aadhaar par party karrwai karegi
 'no one should praise PM Modi on behalf of the Congress
 party ise sweekaar nahin karegi
 "what did Shashi Tharoor say? Significantly, Shashi Tharoor said," i have been saying for six years that if Narendra Modi does something right or says the right thing then he should be appreciated
 taaki jab vah kuch galat karen or ham unki aalochana karen tab uski vishwasaneeyata rahe
 i welcome others from the opposition to agree on this opinion, for which i was criticized at the time

 Please tell that k Muralitharan has been the state president of Kerala Congress

 However, in 2010, Karunakaran returned to the Congress
 unke nidhan ke baad muralidharan ne bhi party main vaapasi kar lee
 He then contested the assembly elections in 2011, which falls under Thiruvananthapuram, the parliamentary constituency of Tharoor
 tharur or muralidharan ke bich achche rishte rahe hai or donon netaaon ne ek duusare kii madad bhi kii he
 However, in this year's Lok Sabha elections, Muralitharan did not support Tharoor as he contested from Vadkara seat

 raashtrapati chunaav ke jariye vichaardhaara kii ladaai main endie se takaraane kii vipakshi ekta bikhar gai he
 What did Nitish Kumar announce to support the NDA candidate, as if the Congress and the opposition parties were bitten if there was no blood
 aakhir is ekta ke nishane par 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav he or centre ke sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa virodh
 In such a situation, Nitish has raised 5 questions in front of the Opposition and Congress, whose answers are not found by him
 1
 Nitish has endorsed the NDA presidential candidate, who comes from the Sangh background
 aise main vipaksh ke khilaaf wo vot karenge to phir baad main vipaksh ke saath aane par vipaksh kii vishwasaneeyata kitni bachegi?2
 Would not the support of a strong face of the ideology against which the opposition is opening the front weaken the opposition? 3
 vichaardhaara kii baat karne valicongress or lalukya bihar main nitish ke netritv main sarkaar main bane rahenge? aakhir tab vichaardhaara kaa sawaal kahaan jayega? kyonki, nitish tark kuch bhi den, lekin vipaksh kii mul ladaai ke khilaaf to wo ja hi rahe hai
 4
 kya vipaksh nitish ko kinare karke nitish par ghar vaapasi kii tohamat lagane kii himmat kar paayegaa? nitish ko endie ke saathi hone kaa tamgaa de paaegaa?5
 On the one hand, there has been a discussion within the Congress that, if there is a screw in the future to stop Modi, to make a non-congress a PM, then he can especially agree on the name of Rahul Nitish
 aise main nitish kaa taaja kadam kitna bada jhatka he, iskaa andaja laga hi lijie
 By the way, Nitish Kumar, an expert in political stakes, has also supported UPA candidate Pranab Mukherjee while living in NDA
 saath hi modi ke endie ke piem ummidavaar banane ke baad endie chhod gaye or congress-lalu ke saath ho liye
 So, this time Nitish has gone in the opposite direction
 is sawaal kaa jawaab to baad main milegaa, lekin philhal nitish ne congress or vipaksh kii kirakiri to kara hi di he
 The Congress, which was seen on the backfoot with the support of jdu's Kovind, kept repeating the same thing on several occasions when Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari asked this question
 manish ne kaha ki guuruuvaar ko vipakshi dalon kii baithak he
 Till then, there will be no major change in the situation
 isliye uskaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 Do not turn around and ask questions, let me just say, wait till Thursday

 haalanki yah report bataati he ki jail main band kaidiyon kii kya sthiti he
 The highest undertrial prisoner report in UP states that as of the end of 2016, there were 4,33,033 people in jails in the country, of which 68% were under trial or people who are to be convicted for the crime

 Similarly, there are 2 women jails in Rajasthan
 aabaadi ke lihaaj se sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh main mahaj ek mahila jail he
 Talking about the Central Jail, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh have the highest number of Central Jails in 29 States and 7 Union Territories where both states have 11-11 Central Jails
 maharashtra, punjab, rajasthan or tamilnadu main 9-9 central jail hai
 Uttar Pradesh is far behind here and there are only 5 Central Jails
 kshamta se zyada kaidi jelon main bandenciarabi kii report ke anusaar 31 disambar, 2016 tak desh ke 1412 jelon main 4,33,003 kaidi band the
 While these jails have the capacity to hold 3,80,876 prisoners
 uttar pradesh kii baat kii jaae to yahaan kii jelon main 95,336 kaidi kaid hai jabaki yahaan par mahaj 58,111 kaidiyon ko rakhane kii kshamta he
 In this way, 164 more than the capacity in up's jails
 1 fisadi kaidi band hai
 There are jails of Dadar and Nagar Haveli, Chhattisgarh, New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Meghalaya in poor condition across the country in case of holding more prisoners

 Only 9 percent of the prisoners are closed
 yahaan kii jelon main 64 kaidiyon ko rakhe jane kii kshamta he jabaki yahaan par mahaj 7 kaidi hi band hai
 Nagaland jail has a capacity to hold 1,450 prisoners, while only 413 are in prison
 pratishat ke aadhaar par dekha jaae to 28
 5 per cent sits

 In the factional struggle, there have been frequent incidents of jail breakings, jailbreak between prisoners and firing in Delhi prison jail

 In Uttar Pradesh, 373 prisoners died by natural means while 56 died in unnatural ways
 35 fisadi surakshakarmi kambharat main jail kii vyavastha bahut acchhee nahin he
 More than half of the prisoners are those who are imprisoned as undertrials, so most of the jails of the country are kept in excess of prisoners
 desh ke 36 rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon main jelon par nigaraanee ke liye 81,568 surakshakarmi chahie lekin 53,370 surakshakarmi hi maujuud hai, jo kul maang kaa 65
 It is only 4 percent
 jelon ko 28,198 surakshakarmi or chahie, lekin ise puraa karnaa abhi sambhav nahin he
 In this way, a security guard is deployed for every 91 prisoners in the country
 chandigarh (100 fisadi) ke alaava meghalaya, kerala, daman and div or nagaland aise rajya hai jahaan par 90 fisadi se zyada surakshakarmi jelon main tainaat hai
 At the same time, 10,407 security personnel have been selected for the jails of Uttar Pradesh while only 6,598 security personnel are posted in the jails
 is tarah se sabase bade rajya main kareeb 37 fisadi surakshakarmi kam hai
 The condition of the jails of the national capital Delhi is also not very good
 yahaan kii jelon ke liye 3,176 surakshakarmi milane the, lekin 1,634 surakshakarmi hi uplabdh hai
 Due to the low number of security personnel, it is difficult to keep an eye on the movements of prisoners, especially in many states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi where the crime rate is high and more prisoners are lodged in the jails

 Premium charges apply !! Health minister Tej Pratap Yadav, the elder son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, has again suffered a major setback
 aavantit petrol pump kaa license radd kar diya gaya he
 In 2011, Tej Pratap Yadav was given license by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited to run petrol pump in the bypass area of patna
 isi maamle ko lekar bhaajapa netaa susheel kumaar modi ne aarope lagaaya tha ki tej pratap yadav ne saal 2011 main petrol pump kaa license dhokhadhadi or farji kagajaat jamaa karke hasil kiya tha
 It is known that Modi had alleged that Kitej Pratap had fraudulently acquired a petrol pump of Bharat Petroleum by claiming the other's land as his own
 modi ne is maamle main bharat petroleum corporation limited main shikaayat darj karai thi or tej pratap ko aavantit petrol pump ke license ke ko radd karne kii maang kii thi
 After investigation, Bharat Petroleum had revoked the license of the petrol pump allotted to Tej Pratap Yadav, but Lalu's son Tej Pratap had stayed the petition by the lower court on the order to cancel the petrol pump of Bharat Petroleum
 haalanki, brihaspativaar ko nichali adaalat ne bharat petroleum dwaara tej pratapyadavako aavantit petrol pump ke license ko radd karne ke faisle se roak hataa liya, jiskaa sidhaa matlab yah hua kilalu ke bete tej pratap yadavako aavantit petrol pump kaa license radd mana jayega
 This is the last day of campaigning in Karnataka
 athak jute rahane vaale narendra modi kii zyada se zyada sabhaayen karne kii yojana taiyaar ho chuki thi
 His first rally that day at 10 am in Bangarpet, an urban center famous for Kolar gold mines
 30 baje shuru hui
 The mines were closed down, but Modi knew how to fill the crowd
 unhone kaha, ''kolar kabhi hindustan main sone kii khadaanon kaa raja tha
 But now you have emerged as the king of mango, silk and milk
 ''apni tarif se khush bheed main garjana or taaliyon kii gadahadaahat ke bich pradhanmantri or party ke pradhan prachaarak ne unhen bharosa dilaayaa ki agar unhone bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko vot diya, to ve paidaavaar badhaane ke liye sinchai kii suvidha or upaj ko bazaar main le jane ke liye rail connactivity muhaiyaa karenge, taaki yah jila desh main aamon kii rajdhani banakar ubhare
 This was Modi's charisma and his ability to connect directly with the audience (despite that his speech in Hindi was translated into Kannada) and with him the party president Amit Shah's very rigorous strategy at every constituency level
 , Which proved to be a game changer in the Karnataka elections
 modi ne chunaav prachaar ke aakhri hafte main rajya bhar main 21 reliyon ko sambodhit kiya or chunavi surveykshan karne waalon ne mana ki isse bhaajapa ke voton main ijapha hua, jisase use gaddinshin congress par badhat hasil hui
 The BJP emerged as the single largest party by winning 104 seats in the state, but fell short of the simple majority of 112 seats needed to form the government on its own
 (rajya vidhansabha main kul 224 siten hai, par do siton ke chunaav may ke aakhir tak taal die gaye hai)
 Modi must have been disappointed that the bjp's seats fell short of the party's expected 130 seats
 magar nai dilli sthit bhaajapa ke nae shandaar mukhyalay main jeet ke apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri khandit janadesh ke baavjood is dakshini rajya main sarkaar banane or vishwaas mat hasil karne ko lekar aatmavishvaas se bhare najar aae
 He promised that "BJP will never let the development of Karnataka be affected
" '' unhone mana ki ve rajya main chunaav sabhaaon ko sambodhit karte vakt bhashaa kii rukaawat ko lekar ashanka se bhare the, par unhen yah dekhakar khushi hui ki ye ashankaayen niraadhaar thim
 He also said with Fatah's passion, 'the opposition had made the impression in the country that the BJP is the party of North India — a part of the Hindi-speaking states
 karnataka ke logon ne un partiyon ko karaara jawaab diya he jo hamen in (uttar-dakshin) lakiron main baantne kii koshish karte hai
 "to gain power in Karnataka, an industrially prosperous and internationally dominant state, is extremely important for the bjp's Mission South
 karnataka dakshin main tamilnadu ke baad duusari sabase badi arthvyavastha he
 It is also the fourth largest economy in the country after Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu
 itnaa hi nahin, yah rajya congress kaa aakhri bada garh bhi tha
 It not only gave the country's oldest party a place to set foot in the south, but was also considered to be a state that provided the power of money to keep the party alive
 jaisaa modi ne tanj kasate hue kaha tha, ''karnataka ke bagaiyr congress ghatakar 3 pi—punjab, puduccheri or parivaar—rah jaaegi
 The second concern was that the defeat of Karnataka would have signaled a decline in Modi's popularity and would have far-reaching effects in the bjp-ruled states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, where assembly elections are due later this year and where the Congress And there will be a direct fight between the BJP
 is jabardast ladaai ke peeche haalanki mukhya vajah yah thi ki chatur-sujan shah karnataka ko party ke liye 'dakshin kaa darwaja' maanate hai
 Out of the total 545 Lok Sabha seats, 130 seats come from the five southern states — Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala — and the Union Territory of Puducherry
 bhaajapa ke paas philhal inamen se mahaj 21 siten hi hai
 It has the largest presence in Karnataka, from where it has got 17 seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ne kul 282 siten jiti thim or inamen 167 siton yaa kul 59 fisadi siton kaa yogadan uttar pradesh, bihar, jharkhand, chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh or rajasthan ke uttar bhartiya rajyon ne diya tha
 It may not be possible for the BJP to repeat its 2014 performance in many of these states
 isliye party hindi pattee or duusari jagahon par hone vaale nuksaanon kii bharpai kii ummid dakshin bharat se kar rahi he
 The raid in the south is part of the game plan that the modi-shah duo has been working on since the NDA took over in 2014
 jahaan shah ko poling booth str ke network kii aguai main maharath hasil he, vahiin modi ne badi mehnat se akhil bhartiya apil ke saath logon se tikaoo naata joda he
 The combination of the two shifts voters into seats for the better, especially given that the party's support base is different in different constituencies
 yah karnataka ke chunaav nateezon main khaas taur par jaahir hua, jahaan kul pade voton main se congress se do fisadi kam vot hasil karne ke baavjood bhaajapa ne apane pratidwandvi se acchhee-khaasi taadaad main zyada siten jeet leen
 Both Modi and Shah realized that the specifics of each southern state are distinct and distinct from each other, given the political background of each southern state and the comparative strength of the BJP against the major parties of that state
 inamen karnataka hi akelaa apwaad tha jahaan bhaajapa 2004 main sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi or 2008 main usne sarkaar bhi banaai thi
 In 2019, the BJP is hoping to win at least half of the total seats in the South, ie 65
 party kii ranneetik badhat ke liye tay teen sabase zyada praathamikta vaale rajya karnataka, andhra pradesh or telugana hai
 The expansion of the organization in these states and Modi's all-india appeal and influence, which he has shown and proved in Karnataka after Assam and Tripura, are the main reasons for the party being upbeat and hopeful
 karnataka main bhaajapa rajya vidhansabha chunaavon ke nateezon kaa phayda uthaane ke bharose se sarabor he
 Wherever Modi campaigned in the state, the enthusiastic response from the crowd has given the party hope that it will increase its Lok Sabha seats in the state
 bhaajapa ke ek bade netaa daawa karte hai, ''kinhin bhi do rajyon main hamaari ranneeti ek sareekhee nahin hogi or is baar ham kerala main apni bilkul pehali seat bhale na jeet saken, par ranneetik gathbandhan or sooyeeboojh se bhari siton kii saajhedaari ke dam par ham akeli sachhee rashtriya party banakar ubharenge, khaskar ab jab congress mukt bharat kaa lakshya ham takreeban hasil kar chuke hai
 Soon after the election campaign in Karnataka ended, Shah made Kanna Lakshminarayana the party president of Andhra Pradesh
 haalanki ve bhaajapa main banisbatan nae aae hai, par unki saakh or khubiyaan khaasi asardaar hai—ve congress se paanch baar vidhayak rahe hai or kapu samudaay se aate hai jo aabaadi ke lagbhag 27 fisadi hai
 Former minister Laxminarayana joined the BJP in the 2014 assembly elections after losing bail on a Congress ticket
 vyaavhaarik raajnneeti ke takaajon ne bhaajapa ko party kii rajya ikai ke bheetar kasamasaahat ke baavjood unhen party main shaamil karne ke liye prerit kiya

 lakshmana ko rajya party adhyaksh ke taur par lene ke baad bhaajapa ne obisi ke dabadabe vaale is rajya main reddy-sanchalit party hone kii chhavi ko dho daalaa he
 It has adopted a three-tier strategy from the polling booth to the state level to strengthen the party, just as it did in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka
 lakshmana kehete hai, ''amit shah ne party adhyaksh banane ke baad sanghathan ke is dhaanche kaa sutarapaat kiya tha or hamane 119 main se 60 vidhansabha siton main ise puri tarah kaayam kar liya he
 "the possibility is that the party will contest elections on its own rather than looking for alliances to ensure a three-way division of votes between itself, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the main opposition Congress

 In the capital Delhi, once again, thieves have carried out a high-tech robbery incident
 shaatir choron ne ek nahin do nahin balki ek saath teen dukaanon main chori kii
 Even before the theft, these thieves had disconnected the wires of CCTV cameras installed there and fled with millions of goods and cash
 maamla dilli ke sangam vihaar ilaake kaa he
 There are three shops near the police post on the very edge of the road
 raat main shaatir chor vahaan pahunche or pehle unhone dukaanon ke baahar lage sisitivi camaron kii taar ko kaat diya
 Then broke the locks and strong iron shutters of the shops and cleaned the goods worth lakhs kept there
 unhone mobile kii dukaan, juute kii dukaan or electronics shop ko apana nishaanaa banaaya
 On Thursday morning, Nanakchanddukan, who runs a mobile shop, was shocked to see the locks broken
 unhone turant is baat kii soochna vyapaariyon or police ko di

 EVM is an evergreen issue of the election phase
 is baar do nae mudde ubharkar aae
 The first is the issue of the total number of votes cast on the Election Commission website and the difference in the number of votes received from evms
 uske baad ayog ne spasht kar diya ki website par daale gaye aankade antarim the or unamem sudhaar karke jaldi hi antim aankade daal die jaaenge
 The second issue is the 'disappearance' of evms in large numbers — this information came from inquiries under RTI
 ummid kerani chahie ki ayog aane vaale dinon main is par bhi sthiti spasht kar degaa
 Before the election, the opposition parties had demanded VVPAT (or paper trail) of 50 per cent of the votes cast, which was rejected by the Supreme Court
 vipakshi dalon ne apane andeshon ko bahut acchhee tarah saamne nahin rakhaa or ayog ko aakhirkaar 5 fisadi paper trail tasdik kii ijaajat de di gai, vah bhi bagaiyr yah bataae ki agar iviem or paper trail kii ginati main kaaphi fark saamne aata he to kya kadam uthaae jaaenge
 a former Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) recently said that there is no possibility of machines being tampered with
 magar unhone chunaav ayog ko yah naseehat nahin di ki vah tamaam shako-shubahon ko dur kare
 Two issues need to be investigated: for example, the possibility of fraud in elections
 sajeesh kii theory hamaare desh main bharpoor hai
 One such theory is that the tampering occurred while keeping / carrying evms
