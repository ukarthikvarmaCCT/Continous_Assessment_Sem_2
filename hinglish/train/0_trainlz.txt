 After this, the opposition's attack started and he demanded resignation from the government
 jaahir he, ab sarkaar par dohari musiibat he
 Rajya Sabha to pass the bill and withstand a tremendous attack from the opposition
 mangalvaar tak sawaal ye tha ki kya hoga lokapal kaa
 But today the question has become what will happen to the government

 jahaan bollywood filmein banane main laagat badhane kii baat se pareshaan he, vahiin bollywood phans ko tension he ki fevorett actor kii film dekhne ke liye unako zyada jeb dhili kerani padegi
 It is being told that a ticket of 100 rupees or less for a film will attract 18 percent tax
 jabaki isse zyada keemat hone par 28 pratishat tex bharna hoga
 In such a situation, the distributors believe that GST on single theater will be less than that of Assertamplex
 kya lautenge single screen ke achche dindrasal, 100 rupee kaa tikat rate philhal single screen par mil saktaa he
 In such a situation, if the ticket prices here remain low after the GST, then the crowd of those watching the film on single screen cinemas can return
 vaise bhi pichley kuch dinon main kai single screen theatre band hue hai
 These include the famous Regal Cinema of Delhi
 bataa den ki GST ke tahat sarkaar ne film tikat ko sabase zyada, 28 pratishat vaale tex slab main daalaa he
 Watching a movie in the theater has been considered a part of the luxury lifestyle more than eating at the Five Star Hotel
 five star main khaanaa khaane ko GST ke 18 pratishat vaale tex slab main rakhaa gaya he
 Regional cinema may fall on speculation that GST will impact regional films more than Bollywood
 darasal in filmon par antertenment tex kam lagata he
 Entertainment tax is not levied on Kannada films
 lekin ab in par GST lagane se tikat ke daam bad jaaenge jinke chalate kam darshak in filmon ko dekhne cinemahol pahunchenge
 In an event, actor Kamal Haasan had also pointed fingers at the government about this
 unka kahana tha- international plateform par riginal cinema hi aword jitkar laata he
 In such a situation, the government has not corrected these films by keeping them in the high rate tax slabs of Bollywood's high budget films
 bad saktaa he piresi retfilmein banane main bhale hi bharat sabase aage he
 But the situation in the film industry is not good here
 jis tarah kaa bajet he, us tareeke se filmein kamai nahin kar rahi hai
 The biggest reason for this is piracy
 dangal ho yaa bahubali-2, tamaam filmein relies ke saath hi internet par aa jaati hai
 This hurts the earnings of films
 aise main agarighshtha se bade ratedarshakon kii zyada jeb kaatane lage to piresi kii demand or hogi
 For this, the government as well as the government needs to be alerted from now on

 The Congress has hit back at the Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday over the fighter aircraft Rafale

 But the question is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was present in modiperis at the time of the deal, Congress was not present there, so who is conspiring in it? On March 28 2015, Reliance Defense Ltd was integrated

 unhen jawaab dena chahie
 He said that none of Manohar Parrikar, Arun Jaitley or Nirmala Sitharaman were aware of the Rafael Deal, which was announced by Prime Minister Modi

 But on 10 April 2015, the Prime Minister announced that 36 aircraft were signed between the two countries, while no one else was aware of it
 sibbal ne kaha, pradhanmantri modi ne ek naaraa diya tha ki na khaauungaa, na khaane duungaa, lekin unhen ab apana naaraa badalanaa chahie
 Seeing the manner in which he attained silence, it should be said that 'neither will i tell nor i will let you know

 If you feel the same about the two-year-old India's second independence i
e
 GST, you will now find the constitutional auditor of the country, ie CAG, agreeing with your pain
 sieji ne jiesti kii ‘samgr asafalataa’ kaa report card sansad ko saunp diya he, jise padhate hue barabas 30 june, 2017 kii madhya raatri yaad aa jaati he jab jagamagaate sansad bhawan or diggajon se saje central haul main ugantarkari jiesti avatarit hua tha
 Channels and channels, while singing greetings, the government ministers were telling that after the GST incarnation • Doing business will become the easiest in the world • The tax thieves will not be seen • The treasury of the government will be filled • At least two of the country's growth rate Consider the increase of the percentage, the latest CAG report on GST is a tribute to India's biggest economic recovery since 1991
 jiesti ke tahat kaarobaari sahajata (ej of duing bijness) ko talashne nikle sieji ko kya mila?auditor ne registration system kii padtaal se shuruyaat kii jo karadaata ke liye jiesti ke tilism kaa pravesh dwaar he
 It turned out that many important information is being filled incorrectly
 yahaan tak ki compojishan skim (chote taxpere ke liye turn over aadhaarit jiesti) kaa galat phayda liya ja rahaa he
 The manufacturer's and supplier's invoice, ie, 100 per cent (real time) matching of the bill, was the most fundamental reform of the GST as it had to refund the tax paid on the raw material
 yah vyavastha kabhi lagu nahin ho saki
 As a result, the GST was fiercely fraudulent
 ek karadaata ne 6 lakh karod ru
 Claimed a refund, which was later rectified
 panjikaran, hisaab-kitaab (invais milan) kii tarah hi tex bhugtan kaa system bhi ghist rahaa he
 Tax payment by debit credit card has not started till date
 in asafalataaon ke chalate ausatan 60 fisad karadaata hi ritern file karte hai
 The CAG sadly informed that after GST, the tax honesty has not increased, though the theft has increased considerably
 kar niyamon ke paalan, nae karadaataaon or khapat (kar daron main riyaayat ke kaaran) main badhotaree kii madad se rajasav badhanaa tha lekin yah sudhaar to sarkari khajaanon ko bahut mahangaa padaa he
 The rate of increase in revenue of the government before the implementation of GST (2016-17) 21
 33 fisad thi jo ghatakar kareeb ek-chauthai yani 5
 80 percent (2017-18)
 jiesti main kai tex shaamil kiye gaye the, unase milane vaale rajasav kii tulana main centre kii jiesti se kamai das fisad (2017-18) ghat gai
 The auditor's report also states that the government violated the rules of the constitution in sharing the IGST on inter-state trade with the states
 isamen kai rajyon ke saath bhedbhaav hua he
 States may become vocal after the cag's seal on this mistake
 lagbhag 122 pej kii yah report niyamon main baar-baar badlaav, jiestn main takneekee khamiyaan, galat gananaaon kii padtaal karte hue kahati he, sarkaar ko yah samajhnaa chahie tha ki jiesti jaise vishaal or jatil system main jaraa si chook bade nuksaan va asuvidha kaa sabab banegi lekin yahaan to do saal se jiesti kaa sankraman puraa hota hi nahin dikh rahaa he
 It is important to remember that amidst the excitement of the GST revision of that midnight, the dream of increasing the country's growth rate by two percent was also shown
 jiesti main asankhya badlaav hue lekin is sudhaar ke baad na keval har pramukh utpaada kii khapat giri he balki aarthik vikaas dar har timahi nae gadde talash rahi he
 The most serious thing is that the Finance Ministry did not allow the CAG to audit the all-india data of GST, despite all the shame
 sieji ne apni report main kaha he ki ye khamiyaan field audit ke aadhaar par pai hai, isliye yah simit audit he
 It is worth mentioning that under Section 65 of the preliminary draft of the GST Act, the CAG had the right to call for information from the GST Council, but in October 2017, the GST Council removed the CAG from overseeing this reform
 samajha ja saktaa he ki sarkaar jiesti se sieji ko kyon dur rakhana chaahati thi
 a cheap reform ruined two years of the economy
 jiesti kaa samgr audit or is vifaltaa par sarkaar kii javabdehi ab loktantr kaa takaza he

 This was said in a survey report released on Monday by international consulting company Ernst & Young
 surveykshan main 59 deshon ke 921 mukhya vittiya adhikariyon se saakshaatkaar liya gaya
 36 per cent of the executives interviewed said that investment spending in a fast-growing economy like India exceeded their expectations, while 43 per cent said their investment took longer than expected
 desh main nivesh karne vaali companiyon ne puunji waapas nikaalane main hone vaali kathinaayee ko ek badi chintaa kaa vishay bataaya
 Officials also termed the damage caused by corruption to the country's image globally as another matter of concern

 com / 8q6cmwqwis The bad phase of 'the Grand Old Party' is not taking its name
 is vakt congress ke saamne sabase bada sawaal he ki party adhyaksh pad kii kaman sambhaal kar koun party ko raajnneetik bhavar se paar lagaae
 According to sources, on Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi made it clear at the party's Lok Sabha parliamentary party meeting that he would not continue as the Speaker
 sonia gandhi kii maujuudagi main ye baithak sansad bhawan parisar main hui
 Just before this, youth activists led by Youth Congress President Keshav Yadav and Vice President BS Srinivasan gathered at Rahul's Delhi residence '12, Tughlaq Lane 'and urged Rahul Gandhi to continue as President
 duusari taraf, sansad bhawan parisar ke party daftar main sonia gandhi kii maujuudagi main party ke loksabhaa saansadon ne rahul se pad par bane rahane kii apil kii
 According to Rahul gandhisutras adamant on leaving the post, party mps Manish Tiwari and Shashi Tharoor argued in a closed-door meeting and told Rahul that, 'the responsibility is not one of any but the collective, the party needs you most this time is
 aapke sivaa koi vikalp nahin he
 Therefore you should remain the president
 'lekin rahul apni baat par ade rahe or saaf kar diya ki, 'main faisla kar chukaa hum, main haar kii jimmedaari lekar pad par nahin rahoonga
 After the meeting, when Rahul Gandhi was asked, 'month has passed, will you remain the party president or not?' On this, Rahul bluntly said, 'I have told my decision in the meeting today, i will not be the party president
 'rahul kaa ye jawaab sunakar baithak main maujuud sabhi saansad sann the
 No one appeared to be officially speaking on the issue
 darasal, sabhi ye aas lagaae baithe the ki, maheene bhar se zyaada ho gaya, desh bhar ke congressi netaaon dwaara rahul se pad par bane rahane kii apil kii gai, aise main sabhi ummid lagaae baithe the ki, rahul aakhirkaar maan jaaenge
 But everyone is disappointed after Rahul's latest stance
 23 may 2019 ko loksabhaa ke nattejey aae to congress kii lagaataar duusari baar badi haar hui
 The party, including Rahul Gandhi, did not expect such a defeat this time
 narendra modi sarkaar ke khilaaf lambey arse se, khaas taur par rafel deal par, muhim chalaane ke baavjood bijepi ko 2014 ke mukaable zyada seat milin or dobaaraa purna bahumat se modi sarkaar satta main ai
 Distance from Rahul Gandhi's party? 
 
 rahul ne aisi paristhiti main haar kii jimmedaari khud lekar congress adhyaksh pad se istife kii peshkash kar di
 Not only this, in the working committee meeting, Rahul even said that, you people should choose the president out of Gandhi family i
e
 Sonia Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi's name should not be named for the post of president
 haalanki tabatak kaarysmiti ne rahul ke istife ko asweekaar kar diya tha
 In the working committee, everyone was assuming that in 2014, on the lines of Sonia, Rahul will be considered late
 rahul lagaataar congress adhyaksh pad se istipha dene par ade hue the, tab netaaon ne vikalp na milane kii baat kahkar unase dobaaraa milakar pad par bane rahane kii guzarish kii
 Even then, Rahul had reiterated, 'you guys find a non-gandhi president, till then i am in the post
 is bich rahul ne bataur adhyaksh congress kii nai niyuktiyon ke kaagajon par dastakhat karnaa bhi band kar diya
 The appointments which were earlier approved by Rahul Gandhi, now they were replaced in the name of All India Congress Committee
 press relies bhi kuch isi tarah jari hone lageen
 In such a situation, Rahul's latest stance put the entire party in disarray
 koi party netaa khud ko yaa kisi or kaa naam sujhane kii himmat nahin kar paa rahaa, aise main agar rahul nahin to party adhyaksh koun? congress ke liye yahi yaksha prashn he jiske sulajhane ke liye party gandhi parivaar se hi koi ishaara milane kii ummid lagaae baithi he

 The composition of Ajit Kumar, who has played a long and successful innings, is definitely a treat for his new and old readers
 ve ek saath sahitya sarjak, samaaj chintak or yashasvi adhyaaapak rahe hai
 His graceful personality, student-friendly nature and his cheerful voice on the literary platforms have made him distinct, but also soulful
 yahi atmiyata or antarangta unki rachanaaon main bhi prasann mukhar rahi he
 The poem titled Rebellion of His Famous Poets, sometimes in eleven lines, was frequently cited by almost all contemporary critics in a long discussion on 'tradition versus modernity' in the sixties

 Along with self-realization, the request for self-realization and meditation is also pulsed in his poems
 ve apni lekhakeeyata ko pathak se alag kar kabhi nahin dekhte
 Therefore, many of his works address themselves more than the readers
 is tarah kaa samvaad kavi-pathak ke bich ke dwandv or duuri ko hataa detaa he

 Ajit Kumar understands seriously how the experience is shared between the creator and the reader

 The strength of this collection is the two essays compiled in it from the living world and Akavita towards poetry

 Ajit Kumar, who acquainted us with the entire poetic world of Kavivar Bachchan, has engraved six episodes related to him in Ankit Do (1962), in which many aspects of his personality can be seen, especially on February 2, 1960 of Hindi employees Vasantotsav celebrated on behalf of Bachchan

 'modi he to mumkin he' yah naaraa yun hi safal nahin hua balki iske peeche kii mehnat or ranneeti kuch aisi rahi jisane uttar pradesh main bijepi ko abhedya bana diya
 How the experiment proved to be a game changer with the workers! The BJP had quietly given a task to its workers and that was to get the entire family to vote before 10 am on the day of polling
 yah bijepi ke apane us 'e' grad ke booth prabandhan kaa jimmaa tha jahaan bijepi hameshaa jitati rahi he
 Under this, the BJP had a massive polling strategy at its booths and it was successful in that
 kaise kaaryakartaaon ne jalpan ke pehle parivaar ke matdaan ko banaaya mul mantrapradesh ke 1 lakh 37 hajaar booth, jahaan bijepi kaa sanghathan he usamen saath hajaar booth bijepi ke e grad ke booth hai
 Where the BJP succeeded the campaign of 'activist family voting before refreshment'
 bijepi kaa doosraa bada kaarykram pradhanmantri modi ke yojanaon se labhanvit pariwaron tak pahunchane kaa tha
 Each BJP worker was given a target to reach 5 beneficiaries, which was increased by BJP to 20 and before his election campaign, BJP completed this target i
e
 every BJP worker reached the house of one beneficiary and Modi's plans
 Ask for direct votes in the name of
 bijepi ke sanghathan mahaamantri sunil bansal jinhen uttar pradesh main bijepi sanghathan kaa chanakya kaha jaataa he unhone bijepi ke ek karod se zyada kaaryakartaaon se samvaad kiya or feedback liya or yahi ranneeti bijepi ko upi main 50 fisadi se zyada vot dilaane safal rahi
 When the Grand Alliance was being formed in Uttar Pradesh, then Amit Shah had set a target of 51 per cent of the vote, which was not easy to fulfill as the BJP got more than 43 per cent of the votes in 2014
 is baar 7 fisadi vot badhanaa kisi sapane ke sach hone jaisaa he
 How the grand alliance collapsed? General Secretary of UP BJP Sunil Bansal told Aaj Tak that BJP was sure to win in 53 seats, it was a tough contest in 27 seats and only on such seats, the enthusiasm and enthusiasm of our management, workers helped a lot
 pradhanmantri kii yojanaayen or amit shah ke prabandhan kushalta jameen par utari or jameen par bane maahaul ne hamaare chunaav prachaar ko dhar diya jisaki vajah se mahagathbandhan upar to baari dikhataa rahaa lekin neeche se uski jameen khisakati rahi
 Meenakshi Seshadri, who was once one of the successful Bollywood actresses, is no longer interested in films
 unhone pushti kii he ki vah unki safal film 'ghayal' (1990) ke sikval main nahin hai
 Meenakshi, currently based in the US, made an appearance at an event attended by many celebrities from cinematography
 aisi atakalein thim ki minakshi 'ghayal' ke sikval se bollywood main vaapasi karengi, lekin unhone kaha, 'baatcheet chal rahi thi, lekin kuch bhi tay nahin hua
 Everything you have heard so far is just speculation and this speculation is not true
 ' Meenakshi said, 'I am not interested in films right now
 main naatakon or sangeet naatyon main kaam karnaa chaahuungi
 Meenakshi left her film career for her family
 unhone kaha, "maine itane varsho tak filmon main kaam nahin kiya, kyonki mere liye mere bachche or parivaar zyada mahatvapurn hai
 i am thinking that maybe on the day my daughter graduates, i might think of doing something

 The NPP in the state is leading a coalition government in collaboration with regional parties and the BJP
 (input bhashaa se) Four years have passed for Narendra Modi to become the Prime Minister of the NDA government
 is dauraan unhone kai mahatvapurn yojanaon kii neenv rakhi
 'sansad Adarsh gram Yojana' is one of his more ambitious schemes
 piem modi ne oktober 2104 ko isaki shuruuaat kii thi
 Under this scheme, three villages were to be adopted in three phases by the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha mps
 piem modi ne isaki shuruyaat karte hue kaha tha, 'isse acchhee raajnneeti ke dwaar khulenge
 Even when this happened, top Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi adopted the villages on their call
 kya he adarsh gram yojnahar saansad apane ilaake main koi bhi gaanv chun saktaa he, lekin inamen unka apana gaanv yaa sasuraal kaa gaanv nahin hoga
 The Sansad Adarsh yojana should have three characteristics - it should be based on demand, motivated by society and public participation in it
 piem modi ne is yojana kii ghoshnaa ke samay kaha tha, 'aaj sarkari yojanaayen bahut sari hai
 Taking the plans to one place will reveal difficulties, drawbacks and a way to simplify them
 phir jaakar vyavastha main parivartan shuru hoga
 'one village was to be adopted by 3 villages
 By 2016, each MP had to adopt one village and develop it
 2019 tak do or gaanvon or 2024 tak aath gaanvon kaa vikaas kiya janaa tha
 The PM also appealed to the state governments to encourage the legislators for this scheme, so 5 to 6 more villages could be developed in each constituency
 piem modi ne teen gaanv liye godais yojana kii shuruyaat ke maukey par modi ne kaha tha, 'ham sab milakar ek rachanaatmak raajnneeti kaa dwaar kholenge or raajnneetik chhooaachhut se pare hokar kaam karenge
 The great men of the last century, Jayaprakash Narayan, Mahatma Gandhi, Ram Manohar Lohia and Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, have an impact on one or the other even today
 in sabase prerana lekar ham is kaam ko aage badhayen
 Under this scheme, Prime Minister Narendra Modi adopted Jayapur village, Nagepur village and Kakadia village in his constituency Varanasi
 upie cheirperson sonia gandhi ne raibareli ke udwa gaanv ko god liya to congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne amethi ke dih gaanv ko god liya
 According to the government report, the scheme has been very successful according to the central government data
 november 2017 ko centre sarkaar kii ore se jari bayaan main kaha gaya ki saansad adarsh gram yojana ke tahat 19,732 project puure kar liye gaye hai or 7,204 par kaam chal rahaa he
 However, whatever the government claims, like other schemes of the country, this ambitious plan of PM Modi could not reach the ground
 iske paryaapt kaaran bhi hai
 No special funding arrangements: Funding arrangements were not made at the level of the way the scheme was publicized
 iske liye koi nayaa fund nirdhaarit nahin hua
 The mps were told that the existing schemes running in the country - Indira Awaas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, MNREGA, Backward Regents Grant Fund, MP Fund, Gram Panchayat Earnings, Central and State Finance Commission funds and Corporate Social Responsibility
 Be used
 saansadon ne hi dikhaai berukhiis yojana ke china charan the
 The first phase was to adopt and develop a village between 2014 and 2016
 is dauraan 543 loksabhaa saansadon main se 500 saansadon ne or 245 rajyasabha saansadon main se 203 saansadon ne gaanvon ko god liya
 In the second phase i
e
 between 2016 and 2018, only 340 Lok Sabha mps and 126 Rajya Sabha mps adopted the villages
 tisare charan yani 2017 se 2019 ke bich gaanvon ko god lene vaale saansad or kam ho gaye
 So far only 141 Lok Sabha mps and 32 Rajya Sabha mps have adopted the villages
 bura ho gaya adarsh graamon kaa hallsaansadon ke god liye kai gaanvon ko adarsh gaanv ghoshit to kar diya gaya, lekin kuch hi dinon main un gaanvon kii haalat pehle jaisi ho gai
 These villages also include two villages - Jayapur and Nagepur, adopted by PM Modi
 yahaan par soshal corporate risponsibility (CSR) ke tahat kai kaam karaae gaye the, jinaki gunvattta kuch maheenon baad hi saamne aane lagi
 To find out what is the condition of Adarsh villages, it will be appropriate to examine the two adopted villages of PM Modi - Jayapur and Nagepur - how they live up to the standards - 1- Road: After PM Modi's adoption, about 30 km from Varanasi The roads leading to distant Jayapur and Nagepur were initially pitched
 lekin iconomics times kii report ke mutabik do monsoon ke sijan yani oktober 2016 tak hi in gaanvon kii 10 kimi lambii sadakon par bade-bade gadde ban gaye
 At the same time, there are no benches left in the bus shelter built in Jayapur village and people sit there and play cards
 2- safayeein gaanvon main svachh bharat abhiyaan bhi chalaaya gaya, haalanki uski pariniti bhi khaas nahin rahi
 Around 400 toilets were built in both villages, but it was revealed in India Today that only 20 per cent of them are being used
 kisi main daravaaje nahin the to kisi main pani
 Toilet pits were also built under them, making it even harder to use them
 3- bijliindia today kii padtaal main saamne aayaa ki jayapur ke padosi gaanvon main chah-saat ghante bijli milti he, jabaki is gaanv main 12 se 14 ghante bijli aane lagi
 The reason for this is the 25 kv solar panels installed at a cost of Rs 70 lakhs
 nagepur main bhi 50 kevi ke solar panel lagaae jane the, lekin jameen na milane se yah maamla lataka padaa he
 However, after some time, the battery of the panel of Jayapur was stolen and this news was in the news
 4- rojgaradonon gaanvon ke yuvaaon ko ab bhirozegaar ke avasaron kaa intjarai
 According to et's report, Jayapur village was earlier dependent on handlooms
 baad main yah nai tareeke ke kheti karne ke liye janaa jane laga
 The expectations of the youth have increased since PM Modi's adoption of this village
 unka rujhaan kheti ke bajaae jald paise kamaane ke liye thekedaari kii ore badha
 Many people of these villages opened accounts in banks thinking that money will be deposited in their accounts by the PM
 5- swasthya or panijayapur gaanv ke logon ko aaj bhi praathmik swasthya chikitsa centre kaa intjaar he
 According to the report of Indian Express, there is no hospital in this village even today
 800 pariwaron vaale gaanv jayapur main peyajal ke liye do boring pump lagaae gaye, jisamen se ek aksar kharaab padaa rahata he
 The generator installed to run them was also stolen
 prashasan isaki jimmedaari gaanvvaalon par daalata he ki unhen adarsh gaanv ke sansadhano kaa khyaal rakhana chahie
 What the parliamentary committee report says, in a recent report of the parliamentary committee on urban development, it was clearly stated that in the absence of funding and proper action plan, the ambitious schemes of the Government of India will succeed on paper
 report main kaha gaya he ki infrastracchar se judi modi sarkaar kii chah sheersh yojanaon main keval 21 fisadi fund kaa hi istemaal ho sakaa
 These are the plans for which additional funds were announced, including the recent 'smart City'
 adarsh gram yojana ke liye to sarkaar kii ore se kisi atirikt fund kaa intjaam nahin he
 In such a situation, the pm's dream of creating an ideal village with the help of CSR does not seem to be coming true
 piem modi ke hi god liye gaanvon kaa yah haal tab he jabakentre or rajya donon jagah unki hi partiki sarkaar he

 ' andhra sarkaar ne nai rajdhani ke liye beete maheene qareeb 7000 varg kilometre kii zamin notiphoi kar di jiske baad se yah sugabugahat chal rahi he
 In spite of this protest, the NDA government has started preparing to convert all the ordinances into the bill, including the land acquisition issued in recent months during the budget session

 The sequence of disasters in Ukhimath is not new
 pichley do dashak main yahaan ai do darjan se zyada badi prakritik aapadaaon main saikadon log maare ja chuke hai
 In the earlier geological studies related to Ukhimath, Kedarghati and Madmaheshwar, these valleys have been declared as rainy in terms of danger
 1998 main ukhimath ke kareeb madmaheshwar main badal fatne ke baad ahmedabad sthit rashtriya bhautik vigyaan anusandhan centre (piarel) ne madmaheshwar or ukhimath ghati kaa bhugarbheey adhyayan kiya tha
 It found that the earth in this region is continuously moving due to its proximity to central thrust
 central karant ke chalate jameen main daraaren pad rahi hai or chattaane tuutakar khisak rahi hai
 The mountains here are unable to handle the situation like strong water showers and cloudbursts, causing landslides, which quickly turn into debris and cause havoc
 piarel ke varisht vaigyanik or is adhyayan team ke pramukh dow
 Says Naveen Juyal, "the villages in this area are settled on old earthquakes and debris broken by rocks, so they are more sensitive
" hamaari team ne usee samay bharat sarkaar ko report saunpi thi, lekin us par koi kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 '' Dr
 juyal ke mutabik yah prakritik aapadaa anayas nahin he
 This is such a sensitive area that any such disaster at any time can cause havoc here
 himalayan paryaavaran shiksha santhaan ke adhyaksh suresh bhai kehete hai, ''rajya ke 1,200 gaanvon ko punarvaas kii jarurat he, lekin rajya sarkaar yah sankhya 233 bataa rahi he or unka bhi punarvaas nahin kar rahi he
 "to rehabilitate 233 villages, Rs 600 crore," says Om Prakash, Principal Secretary, Disaster Management Department
 kii jarurat he, jiskaa prastaav centre sarkaar ko bheja gaya he
 The rehabilitation work is stalled due to lack of funds
 ''rajya main ek aapadaa prabandhan act bhi he, jisamen aapadaa ke nazariye se khatarnaak sthanon par hone vaale nirmaan kaaryon or in sthanon par rah rahe logon ke niyaman kii vyavastha he
 But even a decade after the act was enacted, its impact is not seen anywhere in the state
 isaki chaaya na to nijee nirmaan kaaryon par dikhti he or na hi sarkari nirmaan kaaryon par
 Dozens of government buildings, including the fire brigade's office in Uttarkashi, are being built in sensitive areas
 saamaajik kaaryakarta mangala kothial kehete hai, ''shuru se hi is act kaa kadai se paalan hua hota to pehle uttarkashi or ab ukhimath main kai jaane bachaai ja sakati thim
 "A big question has arisen from this disaster, that despite so much development of science, scientists have not been able to find any way of predicting disasters?" Or the forecasts of the Meteorological Department and the earlier information about the disaster remain in the office of the department itself and meanwhile the clouds burst and go on spreading the devastation
 Incidents of cloudburst have also increased in Uttarakhand for some time
 gat dedh maheene ke dauraan hi uttarkashi, rudraprayag or bageshwar main badal fatne kii aadha darjan se zyada ghatnaayen hui hai
 National Institute of Hydrology Senior Scientist Drs
 sharad kumaar jain kehete hai, ''das saalon main badal fatne kii ghatnaon main jabardast ijapha hua he, lekin iskaa purvanumaan lagane kii disha main kori shodh kaary nahin kiya gaya
 On the other hand, Director of Uttarakhand State Science and Technology Council, Dr
 rajendra dobhaal kehete hai, ''tej barish or tufaan jaisi aapadaaon kii soochna mausam vibhaag badi aasaani se de saktaa he, lekin vah bhi vibhaag kii filon main hi padi rahati hai
 "this calamity has once again proved that the lives of people in Uttarakhand in the grip of disasters one by one are not at all precious to the government

 koi chintaa, phikr yaa pareshaani ho to sab kuch bhulaakar ek pal aaine ke saamne khadey hokar muskurie, tanaav to kam hoga hi chehre kii raunak bhi bad jaaegi
 a slight smile on the face has amazing strength and it has a far reaching effect
 california uniwarsity ke ek shodh ke anusaar, muskuraahat sirf dil ko sukun hi nahin detii, iskaa sehat se bhi sidhaa sambandh he
 a mere two-inch smile exercises dozens of facial nerves
 lagaataar muskuraate rahiye, isse chehre par jhurriyaan nahin padatin or hameshaa raunak bani rahati he
 This research by chief researcher John Dalton says that smiling exercises muscles from face to neck
 muskuraate vakt chehre kii sabhi mansapeshiyon main khinchaav aata he, jisase jaldi jhurriyaan nahin padatin
 Poets and poets did not write thousands of lions on Mehbooba's smile

 According to another research, smiling is said to have a good effect on the front
 muskuraakar kaha gaya kaam ho yaa farmaaish, uske puraa hone kii sambhaavna 50 pratishat tak bad jaati he
 Boston University Professor of Social Sciences D
 klchar ne is shodh ke liye 10,000 logon ko sample survey ke jariye chunaa
 85 percent of them believe that there have been many occasions in their life when smiling and talking has become a deteriorating task
 baaki 15 pratishat kaa maananaa he ki muskuraahat bahut zyada kaam nahin aati
 When the people involved in the research were asked, what is your response if someone smiles and asks them for something? In response, 75 percent of the people said that they reconsidered the decision not to do their work and 65 percent of the people believed that they do the work
 is shodh kii maane to iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar kisi ko muskuraakar koi kaam karne ke liye kaha jaae to uske hone kii sambhaavna 65 pratishat tak bad jaati he
 Smiling is not the only benefit
 muskaan ke bare main manovishleshak vandana prakaash kahati hai, ‘agar aap kisi se pehali baar mil rahe hai to muskuraahat ke saath kii gayi baatcheet kii shuruuaat maahaul ko halkaa banaati he or aapas main khul kar baatcheet karne kaa mauka detii he
 'she says,' Smile is very useful not only in personal life but also in your office
 jab aap subah muskuraate hue apane kaam kii shuruyaat karte hai to kaam main aapkaa man lagata he or vah jaldi khatm bhi ho jaataa he
 Also your smile has a good effect on the office colleagues
 ’vaise har vakt muskuraana bhi thik nahin he
 If you are involved in someone's sorrow, or if you are getting scolded by the boss for any work in the office, then avoid smiling, otherwise you may have to give

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who defended his fast bowlers till recently, has now held him responsible for this after losing the ODI series against New Zealand

 Dhoni said after the match, to be honest, our bowling was very disappointing
 yah aisa wicket tha jis par aap short or wide gend phenkaa nahin chaahate
 i think we did this continuously with the new ball and then the old ball
 ham adhiktar samay sarkal ke baahar paanch kshetrarakshak ko lekar shikaayat karte hai lekin jab aap short or baahar gend phenkate ho to phir isse koi fark nahin padataa
 i think the fast bowlers gave a lot of runs
 spinneron kaa bachaav karte hu dhoni bole ki unhone sahi kshetron main gendbaaji kii
 Commenting on repeated mistakes in batting, Dhoni said that we repeated the old mistake of losing wickets on important occasions
 puri siries main ham yahi karte rahe
 Despite this, we had reached close to 280 runs
 phir unhone kaha ki yadi ham acchhee gendbaaji karte to yah acha score tha, lekin aisa nahin ho paaya

 Jitendra Mohan Sharma, Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court, says that everyone has the right to protest democratically in India, but no one is allowed to commit violence and damage public property
 unhone kaha ki hindustan kii sarvocch adaalat bhi saaf kah chuki he ki band, hadtaal, virodh pradarshan, march yaa kisi bhi tarah ke andolan ke dauraan hinsa karne or saarvajanik va privet sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchane kii chhot nahin he
 On April 16, 2009, the Supreme Court issued a guideline in in-destruction of Public and Private Properties v
 State of Andhra Pradesh
 isamen sheersh court ne saaf kaha tha ki agar koi kisi hadtaal, band yaa virodh pradarshan ke dauraan public yaa privet property ko nuksaan pahunchaata he, to us nuksaan kii bharpai, us vyakti yaa sanghathan se kii jaaegi, jisane sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchaaya
 Jitendra Mohan Sharma, Senior Advocate of the jail court for up to 10 years for damage to public property, said that if anyone damages public property, then action can also be taken under PDPP Act i
e
 Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act 1984
 isamen 6 maheene se lekar 10 saal tak kii jail kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, action can be taken against the perpetrators of violence, riots, arson and rebellion under the Indian Penal Code
 privansion of damege tu public property act main hinsak virodh pradarshan ke dauraan sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchane par dand dene kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he, lekin sampatti ko hue nuksaan kii bharpai karne kaa koi praavdhaan nahin diya gaya he
 However, the Supreme Court has asked Parliament to make laws in this regard
 lekin jab tak sansad is sambandh main kanoon nahin bana detii he, tab tak supreme court kii guideline ke tahat sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchane vaale pradarshnakariyon se uski bharpai kii jaaegi
 If a nuisance damages your property, take compensation as well
 In addition, if someone's personal property has been damaged during the protest, the aggrieved party can bring a civil or criminal case for him personally
 agar peedit vyakti civil cese laata he, to court usko muaavja dilaataa he

 Modi wave faded in 4 years? What it says: After 2014, the results of 19 by-elections, the 2014 Lok Sabha elections were named after the 'modi wave' and the Bharatiya Janata Party formed the government under the leadership of Narendra Modi with an unprecedented majority
 lekin 2014 ke baad deshbhar main loksabhaa ke liye karaae gaye 19 upachunaavon ke nateezon ne bhartiya janata party ke liye ek bada sawaal khadaa kar diya he
 The question is whether the Modi wave is weakening day by day
 aisa isliye kyonki aisi kai siten hai jinamein 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi jiti thi lekin upachunaavon main yahaan se bijepi ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa

 Sinha, while expressing his "sorrow" over others taking credit for his thinking, clarified that he never mind Vajpayee taking credit for these schemes as he was the "head of government" and was also our top leader

 jabaki isaki tulana main kaam ke maamle main janvari-april maah kaa sijan thodaa thanda rahata he
 At the same time, an attempt has also been made to show it as a result of demonetisation in the website

 karnataka ke siyaasi sankat kaa ab tak koi hal nahin nikaala ja sakaa he
 The central leadership of the BJP is trying to convince the ministers who have resigned, while these ministers are not ready to back down from their demands
 karnataka main bhaajapa sarkaar ke naveenatam sankat ke hal ke mishan par aae party ke kendriya netritv ke doot dharmendra pradhan ne nau mantriyon se istipha waapas lene ke liye kaha
 With the resignation of these nine ministers, the DV Sadanand Gowda government has been in trouble
 karnataka ke party maamalon ke prabharee dharmendra pradhan ne nai dilli ravaanaa hone se pehle bangalore main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke pradesh mukhyalay main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘maine sabhi nau mantriyon ko netritv ke mudde ke hal kaa maarg prashast karne ke liye apana apana istipha waapas lene ko kaha he
 He said that he will inform the central leadership about the talks with rival factions of his Chief Minister VD Sadanand Gowda and his predecessor BS Yeddyurappa
 yediurppa khemaa netritv parivartan kii maang par ada he
 He said that he hoped that the central leadership of the party would resolve the issue
 dharmendra pradhan ne kaha, ‘main kendriya netaaon se charchaa karuunga or aashaa karata hum ki unke dwaara ek acha nirnay liya jayega
 After discussing with state BJP leaders, Dharmendra Pradhan met the RSS leaders and informed them about the situation arising out of the resignation by nine ministers to pressurize the BJP high command to remove Sadanand Gowda from the chief minister's post
 donon hi dhadon ke bich talwaar khinch jane par pradhan ko sankat ko dur karne ke liye kendriya doot ke rup main yahaan bheja gaya tha
 Yeddyurappa is targeting Sadananda Gowda after failing in his previous attempts to regain the chief minister's chair again
 vah chaahate hai ki unhen mukhyamantri ke pad se hataa diya jaae evam jagadish shettar ko nayaa mukhyamantri banaaya jaae
 Interestingly, Sadananda Gowda was once a supporter and loyal of Yeddyurappa, but now there is no track between the two
 party alaakaman ne shanivaar ko is sankat ke hal ke liye sadanand gauda ko dilli bulaayaa tha
 The Yeddyurappa camp is set on a unified agenda to remove Sadanand Gowda, which is why the state is not taking the name of the storm in the BJP and that is why the Chief Minister was called from Delhi
 yediurppa ke samarthak nau mantriyon ke istife se sankat ke or gahraane ke ek din baad sadanand gauda ne party alaakaman ke hastkshep se iskaa hal nikal jane kaa vishwaas prakat kiya
 State BJP President KS Eshwarappa, who met Sadanand Gowda, has said that there is no question of accepting the resignation

 Rejecting allegations of communalism on Modi, the BJP spokesperson claimed that the minority community in Gujarat is 'happy' and on the support of this section, Modi managed to become the Chief Minister of this state for the third time in a row
 sonkar ne ek sawaal par kaha ki congress upaadhyaksh kaa 24 april se shuru hone vaala do divasiy madhyapradesh daura ‘nirthak’ sabit hoga
 He said, 'people had high expectations from Rahul's speech given from the platform of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)

 yani ki ladki ko yah yakeen ho jaae ki vah din ko raat kahe, to aap raat hi kahenge
 Clearly, there is no need to lie to impress girls
 balki jo kahana he saaf-saaf kah den
 Ranveer also believes that if you hide anything from him, then he will understand it

 adhikariyon or karmchaariyon kii kaary samskruti main sudhaar laane or paardarshita ke liye sarkaar ne sheersh str ke padaadhikariyon se lekar nichle str tak ke karmiyon ke liye biomitric atendence banane kaa sakht nirdesh de rakhaa he
 But this is being followed by very few officers at the top
 jharkhand mantralay main kaam kar rahe akhil bhartiya seva ke 13 adhikariyon ne agast maheene main abtak apni upasthiti darj nahin karai he
 While they come to the ministry every day
 ek adhikari ne sirf ek din to anya bade adhikariyon main ek ne 9, duusare ne 10 tathaa tisare ne 14 din upasthiti darj karai he
 On the other hand, if it is compared to the officers of the State Service, then the matter seems to be quite the opposite
 biomitric paddati se upasthiti darj karaane ke maamle main rajya prashasnic seva ke afasar awwal hai
 On an average, 80-85 percent of officers are attending this method
 yahaan ek dilachasp baat saamne ai he ki siemo or siesao main padasthapit is seva ke afasar atendence lagane main dilchaspee nahin le rahe hai
 The study of these data revealed another thing that 57% of the employees working in the ministry are reaching office prematurely after the installation of biometric attendance machine
 jharkhandake mukhyamantriraghuvar dasane sakht nirdesh de rakhaa he ki jo adhikari biomitric atendence kaa anupaalan nahin karte unka vetan kaat liya jaae
 In spite of the presence, he has given orders to declare the personnel who did not make the attendance absent
 haalanki shuruaati daur main van or police jaise kuch vibhaagon ke karmchaariyon ne is paddati kaa jamkar virodh kiya tha, jo kshetra bhraman ke naam par karyaalay se aksar gaayab rahaa karte the
 But the government's tough stand suppressed the tone of protest
 baharhaal in aankadon se yah baat to jarur sabit hoti he ki jahaan in niyamon kaa anupaalan karmchaaree or chote adhikari to kar rahe hai, vahiin bade adhikari in niyamon kaa khulaa ulanghan kar rahe hai
 Demonetisation has brought Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to an interesting twist of dilemma
 gaalib ne likhaa tha ki imaa mujhe roke he khinche he mujhe kufr, jetali thik aisi hi haalat main hai
 After the austerity of demonetisation, people are expecting him to be swayed on the path of tax concessions, while his faith as finance minister does not allow it
 desh main hai hi kitne tex peyar! keval mutthi bhar
 The collection of income tax has barely registered a double-digit growth in the last two years after numerous attempts and computerization, changes in PAN and TDS rules
 koi bhi badi riyaayat is mehnat is kadar pani pher degi jiskaa andaaj ham aankde dekhakar hi laga sakate hai
 Here are some facts that explain why the finance minister may not be able to give a generous reward for the sacrifice of demonetisation
 pichhalearthik survekshanmen inakam tex ko lekar ek dilachasp aankada prakashit hua tha jiske mutabik:-1
 2 in India
 8 karod tex peyar hai
 2
 inamen se keval 25 lakh log aise hai jinaki inakam das lakh rupee se upar he
 Average annual income of people in this category is 24
 7 lakh rupee he
 3
 54 lakh log paanch se das lakh kii inakam vaale hai
 Whose average earnings 6
 5 lakh rupee he
 4
 kareeb 2
 07 crore people have an income of two to five lakh rupees
 jinaki ausat aay 2
 9 lakhs
 5
 2
 5 lakh rupee tak kii aay tex free he or 2
 Income from 5 to 5 lakh rupees is taxed at 10 per cent
 • yadi vitt mantri tex free inakam kii seemaa main 50,000 rupee kii badhottiri bhi kar dete hai yani ise badhaakar teen lakh rupee karte hai to das fisadi kii kar seemaa main aane vaale karadaataaon kaa ek bahut bada hissaa (do karod main se lagbhag ek karod) log tex ke daayre se baahar nikal jaaenge
 Because the average income of the tax payer in this category is 2
 9 lakh rupee he
 Clearly, which finance minister would like to lose sight of the hard work of raising such a badtex base
 • kayaas or ummiido kaa alam yah he ki notebandi ke tyaag ke badale log chaar lakh rupee or paanch lakh rupee tak kii inakam ke tex free hone kii ummid lagaaye hai
 They should know that if the income up to five lakh rupees is tax free, then the government will have to lose revenue of Rs 37000 crore which is the total income tax collection (2015)
 16) ke das fisadi se bhi zyada he xxrep 4 ! baat notebandi se aae ekamusth kaledhan or us par mili tex ke badale udaar hone kii he nahin
 This concession will be one time but instead the efforts to increase the tax base will be compensated in the long run
 kissa kotaah yah ki agar vitt mantri ne ek karod se adhik tex peyar ko tex daayre se baahar karne kaa man liya hoga tabhi vah utani dariyaadilii dikhaayenge jisaki ummid lagaai ja rahi he
 Apart from income tax concession, finance ministers in India have no direct option to be compassionate
 chunavi raajnneeti kii pavitra paramparaon ke anusaar inakam tex riyaayaton kii ek siyasat bhi hoti he
 Based on this concession, with this budget, a series of concessional budgets are starting for the Modi government
 notebandi ke kaaran yah kram ek saal pehle shuru hota laga rahaa he
 Otherwise, the opportunity for generosity would have come in next year's budget

 How will their own vehicles leave? yahaan ke logon kii pareshaani kaa koi thikaana nahin he or dukandaaron kaa bijness thap ho gaya he
 There is no bus stop here, this was accepted by DTC itself when Arpit Bhargava raised questions through RTI
 2009 main ditisi ne bas stand vaali root plate ko unke ghar ke baahar vaale khambhe se to hataa liya, lekin usee ke aage vaale khambhe par phir laga diya
 That is, this illegal parking of DTC was not stopped
 sabase badi mushkil ye he ki jab log unase basen hataane ko kehete hai driver budtamiji karte hai
 Arpit and his family did not give up, taking the case to court to get rid of the daily routine
 adaalat ne arpit ke haq main faisla diya he or kaha he ki wo ek baar phir likhit taur par apni samasya ditisi ke saamne rakhen or ditisi ko do hafton ke andar unhen tay karnaa he ki agar yahaan bas stop nahin he to yahaan par wo kaise bas terminete karte he

 This jam is due to the problems of the people of the area

 The matter is in court and DTC did not file any reply during the last hearing
 adaalat ne ab maamle kaa hal nikaalane ke liye do hafte kaa samay diya he
 The court has said that the DTC should take such measures that the petitioner does not face any problem from the bus terminal

 ) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar lost his temper on the water table in Patna on Tuesday evening while facing questions
 unhone media ko naseehat dete hue kaha ki jab mumbai or america jaise jagahon par jalajmav hota hai to media kii aakraamakata ko kya ho jaataa hai? haalanki, nitish kumaar aavesh main yah bhul gayi ki mumbai main yaa kisi or shahar main jab barish hoti hai to usase nipatane ke liye vahaan kii sarkaar monsoon purv taiyaari karti hai
 While in the capital Patna, it was found that most of the water pumping pumps were either working below their capacity or they were shut down
 nitish kumaar ne media se jalwaayu parivartan par janajagran karne kii apil kii
 There is no dispute that he is once again the target of a section of the media whose devotion to his ally BJP governments and leaders is well known to Nitish Kumar like a feverish fever under the pretext of water logging
 nitish sarkaar ne patna ke toun planning kii apane shashan kaal main jamkar upeksha kii is baat par koi do mat nahin hai
 The people of Patna have to bear the brunt of this
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki jis nagar vikaas vibhaag, nagar nigam yaa anya sansthaaon ( jinka jimmedaari rajdhani patna kaa vikaas karnaa he) ke bos bhaajapa ke log rahe
 Especially Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi
 patna main sabhi vidhayak bhaajapa ke hai
 But ever since the waterlogging took place in Patna, Nitish Kumar held meetings every day for hours
 raahat or bachaav kaary jamkar chalaaya
 But it is also true that he did not understand the need to talk to the media about what happened and what is happening
 varisht patrakaron kaa maananaa he ki aise main media khaskar godi media ke liye unhen villen bananaa or aasaan ho gaya
 Hence, Nitish Kumar invited an attack on himself
 philhal nitish kumaar ke samarthak bhi maan rahe hai ki unke netaa ko jalajmav ke bahaane do sabak jarur mili hai
 If you ignore any department or leave the trust of your colleague, then whenever there is a problem like water logging, then you will be on the target of both the public and the media
 'mumbai main jalajmav hota hai to
 
 
 Arguments like 'don't work'
 kyonki mumbai main jal nikasi bhi utani teji se hoti hai
 His party spokesman Sanjay Singh also believes that the attack on Nitish Kumar in the media will happen every time at the behest of the BJP, not his opponents, in a planned manner
 kyonki jo channel unke peeche haath dhokar pade hai, unka apana trek record to yahi bataata he ki baat jab bhaajapa sarkaron kii hoti hai to unhen saanp soongh jaataa he

 a daughter who is an adult wants to marry on her own accord
 kar bhi leti he
 But the daughter's father is against marriage

 Now the daughter and her husband hide in fear, but for how long
 lihaaza madad maangane wo soshal media par aa jate hai
 It spreads
 sawaal baap se puche jate hai
 Now, along with all the cleaning, the father himself asks a question
 sawaal ye ki kya baap hone ke naate use beti kii shaadi karaane yaa uskaa acha-bura sochane kaa bhi haq nahin he?siyaaraam ko sakshi maanakar sakshi ne ajitesh ko agle saaton janam kaa saathi chunaa

 kyonki gharavaale beti ko manachaaha khilonaa dilaa sakate hai
 Daughter can feed food in that restaurant wherever she wants
 wo manhage se manhage college main padhaa sakate hai
 In Almukhtasar, the daughter can ask for anything from her father
 bas use apni marzi se apana humsafar chunane kaa haq nahin
 Sakshi fell in love with just this much account
 or pyaar kaa dushman to ye zamana yugon yugon se he
 Don't know how many loved ones have suffered its punishment
 darasal, ye haq bhi nafrat karne vaale apane paas rakhana chaahate hai
 In Assam, hatred wants love to be weighed
 lekin ek mohabbat hi to he jo kii nahin jaati
 It happens
 or shaayad isiilie nafrat ko mohabbat se nafrat he
 So it has always been an attempt to crush love in such a ruthless manner that no one else takes the name of love
 pataa nahin kyon hamen mangal par janaa he

 Ajitesh has made the biggest mistake of his life by marrying the daughter of BJP MLA Rajesh Mishra of g Bareilly

 Above all, the government also has Mishra in the state

 In such a situation, if anyone could have saved Ajitesh then it was social media
 sakshi se pyaar karke ajitesh ke upar to maut mandara hi rahi he
 The lives of family members are also in danger
 ajitesh or sakshi ke saath saath ajitesh kaa puraa parivaar bhi vidhayak ji or unke gundon ke dar se bhaagta phir rahaa he
 On hearing the news of the marriage of father Harish Ajitesh and Sakshi, the family has fled from Noida to Noida

 Has complained to Chief Minister Yogi
 ajitesh ke video ke baad uske pita kaa ye dar saaf bataa rahaa he ki is puure ke puure parivaar kii jaan khatre main hai
 On the other hand, the people of MLA are desperate to find Ajitesh and Sakshi in any case and punish them
 jabaki viral video main sakshi saaf kah rahi he ki ye shaadi usne apni marji se kii he

 ' Former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi knows the art of being in the limelight
 jab wo mukhyamantri the tab apane vivaadaaspad bayanon ke kaaran surkhiyaan batorte the or mukhyamantri kii kursi jane ke baad nitish kumaar par hamalaa bolkar wo surkhiyon main bane rahete hai
 But sometimes friendship with the media also causes trouble
 maanjhi ne kuch pravaktaa rakhe hai jo is baat par dimag lagaate hai ki aakhir maanjhi kaa prachaar prasar kaise kiya jaye
 The police watch over the litchi-mango was also the brainchild of these spokesmen
 lekin shuukravaar ko maanjhi or unke pravaktaaon kii chaal thodi ulti pad gai
 On Environment Day, media persons were called to the Chief Minister's residence that former Chief Minister Manjhi would plant some trees
 media vaale bhi puri taiyaari se pahunche or maanjhi jab tak ped lagane aate tab tak media waalon kii najar sharaab kii bottle par padi jo mukhyamantri lon main padi thi
 Now the question is where did the wine bottle come from
 tippaniyan Certainly cannot come from outside
 is bottle kii sharaab jarur mukhyamantri awaas main rahane vaale kisi vyakti ne upyog kii hogi or bottle vahaan phenki hogi
 When Manjhi came a little later and was asked a question in this regard, he also asked the media persons to leave from there, blaming Nitish Kumar for this
 lekin sawaal he ki aakhir sharaab kisne pi, suraksha main lage logon ne yaa maanjhi ke parivaar ke kisi sadsy ne
 Manjhi has kept some spokespersons who are mindful of how to propagate Manjhi
 lichi-aam par police kaa paharaa bhi inhen pravaktaaon ke dimag kii upaj thi
 But on Friday, Manjhi and his spokespersons got back on track
 paryaavaran diwas par media waalon ko mukhyamantri awaas bulaayaa gaya ki purv mukhyamantri maanjhi kuch ped lagaayenge
 The media persons also arrived with full preparation and by the time Manjhi came to plant the trees, the eyes of the media persons were on the bottle of liquor which was lying in the Chief Minister's lawn
 ab sawaal he ki sharaab kii bottle kahaan se ai
 The comments nishchit rup se baahar se aa nahin sakati
 This bottle must have been used by someone living in the Chief Minister's residence and the bottle was thrown there

 According to BJP leaders, the Prime Minister has been requested for this and is now awaiting his formal 'yes'
 rajya bijepi netaaon ne pradhanmantri ke sambhavit daure ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar di hai
 Ramlila of Aishbagh in Lucknow is one of the most ancient and historic Ramlilaas in the country
 mana jaataa he ki tulsidas dwaara ramcharitamanas kaa srijan karne ke baad unke shishyon ne is ramlila kii shuruyaat kareeb teen sau varsh purv kii thi
 It is also a symbol of ganga-jamuni tehzeeb
 nawabon ke shashan ke daur main yah ramlila chalati rahi
 In the 19th century Sriramalila Samiti Aishbag was registered
 lakhanu ke meyar or bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh dinesh sharma shriramlila samiti eshbagh ke sangrakshak hai
 Sharma said that he has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come to this Ramlila
 amuman saare pradhanmantri dilli main ramlila maidan par ramlila samitiyon ke kaaryakramon main hissaa lete aae hai haalanki 2014 main pradhanmantri modi ko vahaan ravan dahan kaarykram main nahin bulaayaa gaya tha kyonki samiti ke mukhya sangrakshak or purv congress saansad jaiprakash agarwal ne piem modi kii maujuudagi kaa virodh kiya tha
 After this, PM Modi participated in the Ravana Dahan program at Subhash Maidan
 eshbagh kii aitihaasik ramlila kabhi puure maidan main hathi-ghodon or rathon ke jariye hoti thi
 It was later put on stage
 vahaan ram bhawan or tulsi bhawan kaa nirmaan bhi kiya gaya he
 The theme of Aishbagh Ramlila last year was cow slaughter ban and the stage was constructed like the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya
 is saal ramlila main thailand ke kalakaaron ko bhi bulaayaa gaya he
 Significantly, the BJP has decided that the Prime Minister must come to Uttar Pradesh at least once a month in view of the upcoming assembly elections in the state
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki dashahara par piem ke lakhanu aane se kaaryakartaaon kaa josh dogana ho jayega
 The historic Ramlila of Aishbagh was once held by elephants, horses and chariots throughout the grounds

 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan raajnneetik dal apana prachaar karne ke saath-saath vipakshi partiyon par jamkar chhintakashi karne main lagi hui hai
 The words used by various leaders during this scandal like 'RSVP Model', 'toffee Model', 'AK-49', 'news Business', 'brother in law', 'mother-son government', 'shehzada' of politics New idioms have emerged
 raajnneeti kaa yah nayaa shabdkosh nishchit taur par maujuuda raajnneeti kii prakruti jaahir karata he
 BJP leader Narendra Modi seems to be at the forefront of this matter
 haalanki congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi aise kai shabdon kaa istemaal karte sune gaye
 This is perhaps the first such Lok Sabha election in the country's politics, in which tea vendors are so much discussed
 bijepi ne modi kii chaay bechney vaale kii chhavi ko bhunaane ke liye 'chaay par charchaa' naam se hi apana prachaar abhiyaan shuru kar diya
 In this Lok Sabha election, where grand election campaign is being seen on the lines of corporate advertisements, for the first time, some big industrialists of the country were also targeted in the political allegations
 bijepi dwaara prachaarit or bahucharchit gujarat ke vikaas model ko lekar chhidi bahes ne raajnneetik shabdkosh ko kai nae muhaavarey die
 Calling the Gujarat model a 'toffee model', Rahul Gandhi said that the Gujarat government sold the land to industrialists at the cost of toffee
 rahul ne gujarat model par prahaar karte hue ise 'tii-20 match' bhi kah daalaa
 Rahul said in an interview, 'he (modi) gave 45 thousand acres of land to a single person
 bhoomi aavanton main jaise ve tii-20 match khel rahe hon
 We do not do this
 'bijepi ke loksabhaa chunaav main jeet ke daavon ko rahul gandhi ne phula hua gubbaaraa bataaya or kaha ki yah 2004 or 2009 ke chunaavon kii tarah hi foot jayega
 Rahul directly targeted Modi at an election rally and said, 'he (modi) wants to be the watchman of the country
 'modi ne congress kii taraf se apane upar kiye gaye har hamale kaa jamkar jawaab diya or congress netaa rahul gandhi ko aksar 'shahjada' kahkar unki khilli udayi
 Modi said during an election speech, 'shehzada must be playing with his balloons and toffees
 desh ek paripakv netaa chahta he or adhik se adhik trophy jeetna chahta he
 Modi, who was the victim of attacks from all fours for the first time mentioning his marital status in the nomination papers, fiercely targeted the land dispute of Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, in a counter-attack
 modi ne apane kai bhaashanon ke dauraan wadra ko 'jijaji' naam se bhi sambodhit kiya or gandhi parivaar ko aresavipi (rahul, sonia, wadra, priyanka) model kii sangya de daali
 Modi called the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance UPA government a 'mother-son government' and Akhilesh Yadav's UP government a 'father-son government', targeting the Congress as well as the Samajwadi Party government of Uttar Pradesh
 pratidwandvi raajnneetik dalon ke alaava modi ne media par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kuch patrakaron ko 'khabaron ke kaarobaari' tak kah daalaa
 Modi accused journalists of not showing their works in Gujarat and only showing their interactions with industrialists in the news
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf naaraa buland karne vaali bamushkil do varsh puraani party AAP ke netaa arvind kejariwal ko to modi ne 'eke-49' hi kah diya
 Modi threw this idiom by protesting at Kejriwal's talk and targeting the 49-day Delhi government
 kejariwal ko haalanki bhale duusare raajnneetik dalon yaa netaaon ke khilaaf is tarah ke muhaavaron kaa istemaal karte nahin suna gaya, par vah apane har sambodhan main 'usul', 'raajnneeti main bhuuchaal', 'sachai or eemaandaaree' jaise jumale baar-baar doharaate jarur sune ja sakate hai
 One of Mumbai's top builders and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator has told the government that a Mumbai-based luxurious house built by Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan and called 'qaeda-e-azam', should be demolished

 It is worth noting that Jinnah House is built on two and a half acres of land, which is estimated to cost US $ 400 million (about Rs 2,603 crore)
 mangal prabhaat lodha ne kaha, "dakshini mumbai main jinna kaa awaas vah jagah he, jahaan vibhaajan (desh kaa bantwaaraa) kaa shadyantra rachaa gaya tha
 
 
 Jinnah House is a symbol of partition
