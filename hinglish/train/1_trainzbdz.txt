 We can inquire as much as possible while in their judicial custody
 chidambaram ke vakil kapil sibbal ne kaha ki idi pehle to bahut utsuk thi chidambaram ko giraftaar karne ke liye
 The ED even went to his house on 21 August to arrest Chidambaram
 20 taarikh ko bhi chidambaram ke ghar ke baahar notice lagaakar aae the
 The ED said in both the Supreme Court and the High Court that it wanted to interrogate Chidambaram in custody
 sibbal ne kaha ki ye chaahate hai ki chidambaram ko zyaada se zyaada nyaayik hiraasat main rakhen
 Then take custody and then send Chidambaram to judicial custody
 ab ye chah logon se poochtacha kaa bahaanaa bana rahe hai
 They are doing this to hurt Chidambaram
 unhone kaha ki chidambaram to jaanch main sahyog karnaa chaahate hai
 We are saying that you take us into custody
 agar aapako poochtacha kerani nahin thi to aap 20 or 21 agast ko chidambaram ko giraftaar karne kyon aae? aaropee ke paas adhikaar he ki vah court main sarender kar sake
 Chidambaram himself came to the court and said that i want to surrender
 idi ne kaha ki chidambaram 5 sitambar tak police castady main the
 He is then in judicial custody for 15 days
 ham alag agency hai
 We are investigating under PMLA
 aise to har aaropee sarender karke kahegaa ki agency mujhe hiraasat main le le
 The court can decide, send them to 15 days custody
 abhi tak hamane is puure maamle main chargeshit file nahin kii he
 After this debate, the court reserved its order on Chidambaram's petition to surrender and today dismissed Chidambaram's petition

 'ajtak' ne jab unase sawaal kiya ki upendra kushvaha ne kaha ki aap 2020 main kursi kaa pad chhod rahe hai to nitish ne is sawaal kaa koi sidhaa jawaab to nahin diya
 Instead, he spoke of keeping the level of dialogue high

 Nitish Kumar claimed that after his efforts, now 11,000 people are coming for treatment in government hospitals every month
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki 2004 tak rajya main 50 kilometre kaa safar rashtriya rajmarg par tay karne main kam se kam teen ghante kaa samay lagata tha

 captaini kii jimmedaari se hat chuke mahendra singh dhoni ab ek ballebaaj or wicketiper ke taur par team india main khelenge
 Virat Kohli has also advocated for him to play openly, but the position on which Dhoni will bat is still a question
 haalanki viraat kohli ne is sandarbh main kuch sanket de die hai or iske liye unke paas ek khaas plan he
 
 
 Virat Kohli has got another new responsibility after the Test and is expected to have prepared his plan as well
 team main yuvaraj singh kii vaapasi or ajinkya rahane ko mili maukey ne unke iraade jaahir kar die hai
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the most successful captain in Indian cricket history, has abruptly relinquished the captaincy of ODI and T20 team and now he will play in the team as a player
 jaahir he captain kohli ne dhoni ke liye bhi kuch khaas soch rakhaa he
 
 
 Virat Kohli says, 'if i ask him which position he will bat, then i know Dhoni
 
 
 vah kahenge kahin bhi kar saktaa hum, jaisaa aap kahen
 The position at which Dhoni has been batting for the last few years
 
 
 main usase upar unhen ballebaazi karte dekhnaa chahta hum taaki vah cricket kaa puraa anand le saken
 If Dhoni enjoys his game as much as he did in his early days, then Team India will become a strong unit
 ' Dhoni played his first ODI against Bangladesh in 2004
 us vakt vah number 7 par ballebaaji karne aae, lekin vanade main apana sarvaadhik score naabad 183 or 148 ran maahi ne number 3 par ballebaaji karte hue banaae
 Former India captains Sourav Ganguly and Sunil Gavaskar have long advised Dhoni to bat at number 4
 pichley saal newjiland ke khilaaf mohali vanade main dhoni ne number 4 par ballebaaji karte hue team india ko jeet dilaai
 Although he came to this number in Ranchi ODI also, but could not show his magic
 ab sawaal he akhir purv captain ke liye koun si ballebaaji pojishan sabase sahi he? record par gaur karen, to dhoni ne opening karte hue 2 pariyon main 98 ran banaae hai
 This includes 1 half-century while Dhoni has 51 runs in 3 innings of number 8
 unhone sabase adhik ran tisare, chauthe or paanchaven number par hi banaae hai
 Dhoni in middle order pojishan match ran ausat 100 / 50 Number 3 16993 82
 75 2 / 6 Number 4 26 1223 58
 24 1 / 11 Number 5 59 2320 52

 76 2 / 5tippaniyan Statistics show that Mahi is more successful in the middle order
 ballebaaz ke taur par wo middle order main dhamaake kar paae
 
 ab captaini kaa dabaav un par nahin he aise main wo khulkar khel sakate hai
 28-year-old Virat has also answered many questions by looking for the exact role in the team for his first captain
 'dhoni kii kaabiliyat, cricket ke bare main samaj, cricket ke maahaul ko samajhnaa apane aap main khaas he
 With the burden of captaincy removed from his shoulder, he is going to enjoy himself as a batsman in his career

 Book Name: Clean Chitwriter: Yogita yadavprakashak: Indian Gyanpeeth Price: 180 Rupees These stories, written in the center, are easy to read but deeply touching
 kahanikar yogita yadav ke is kahani sangrah ke vishay vishisht hai
 Most of the stories describe the same style as a woman as a focal point, but these subjects are not like the common stories
 stri ke antarman kii uthal-puthal or usee kashmakash main uske saahasik charitra ko badi sahajata ke saath ukera gaya he
 The stories presented also have a connection point and the style in which they are written is quite easy to understand and read
 kahani 'kaki taalluk' main khurshid apane parivaar se taalluk na rakhane vaale maulavee ke farmaan kii dhajjiyaan uda detii he
 These lines describe the existence of a woman, 'the lips which had never said Subhan Allah upon seeing her, today could not do anything except tighten her gait and resistance

 The story ends with a clean chit given to two more people in the 1984 riots and shrugs how his shadow does not leave chase even after an incident has passed
 'grah tal gaye' kahani is satya ko vyakt karti he ki ham chaahe kitne bhi shikshit kyon na ho jaaen, andhvishwaas hamaara peechha nahin chodta
 Every story of 'clean chit' makes the readers aware of the truth of the society

 sarkaar aagaamee chunaav se pehle chunaav surveykshanon par pabandi lagane kii koshish main he
 There are three aspects to this effort: imaginary, practical and legal
 yun to chunaav ayog or rajnatik dal kisi masale par bamushkil hi ekamat ho pate hai lekin is masale par unamem ekta he
 On the one hand, the credibility and method of opinion polls are being questioned
 duusari ore, unase votaron ko prabhavit karne kii baat hoti he
 The allegation is that they promote a sheepish mentality towards potential winners
 yah ajab virodhabhas he
 If there is an error in the process of public opinion polls, then how are they able to influence the trend of voters
 saamaanya samajh or tark to yahi kehete hai ki donon ek saath nahin ho sakate
 If opinion polls inspire voters to turn to potential winners, how do they go wrong many times? Not only this, how do different opinion polls make contrary predictions? Surprisingly, the parties to the ban on public opinion polls (which include senior government lawyers and some officials of the Election Commission) have no concrete figures for this
 unki daleelein zyada se zyada purvaagrah hi kahi ja sakati hai
 From the few data available with sociologists on this issue, it is known from this that the voters are not drawn towards the likely winners of the opinion poll
 agar aisa koi ''bhedchaal” asar hota bhi he to yah daleel di ja sakati he ki uski ''vipareet dhara” use santulit kar sakati he
 Suppose for a moment that these speculations are true
 phir bhi, mujhe yah sawaal karne ke liye maaf kiijie ki ye surveykshan nazaij yaa avaidh kaise ho jate hai? loktantr kaa aadhaar hi soochnaaon ke aadhaar par chayan karnaa he
 People are free to make their decisions based on the information received from various sources
 agar ve tivi, akhbaar, internet se khabar or rajnatik vishleshkon se vichaar jaanane ko swatantra hai to nishchit rup se janamat surveykshanon se bhi soochna hasil karne kaa unhen haq he
 How is it fair for a reporter to guess the electoral trends in a particular area by talking to only 10 people? lekin 1,500 logon kii raay jaanakar janamat surveykshan karnaa kaise galat ho jaataa he? beshak, yah daleel di ja sakati he ki janamat surveykshanon par pabandi kii maang samvidhan ke anuchhed 19(1)(a) main pradutt abhivyakti kii swatantraaa par hamalaa he
 It is absurd to say that opinion polls are unscientific and unreliable
 agar janamat surveykshan vaaki avishwasaneey hai to centre sarkaar ne sabase badi surveykshan agency, rashtriya namoona surveykshan sanghathan (eneseso) kyon bana rakhi he? 1950 main sthapit yah sanghathan philhal sankhyikee mantralay ke tahat kaam karata he or desh main saamaajik-aarthik surveykshanon kaa sabase bada sanghathan he
 Countless policies and programs of the government run on this data
 vidambnaa dekhie ki jo chunaav ayog janamat surveykshanon par pratibandh kaa itnaa kaayal he, usne khud ''matadaata kii jaankaree, rujhaan, vyavhaar or ravaiya” jaanane ke liye deshvyapee janamat surveykshan karavaaya he
 It was India Today that started the poll in a big way in the 1984 general elections in the country
 uske baad desh main loksabhaa or vidhansabhaon ke kareeb 125 chunaav ho chuke hai
 Of these, the exact sitting rate of public opinion polls has been around 95 per cent
 is profeshan main lage log apni saakh ke dam par hi tike hai or yah saakh unke surveykshanon ke aadhaar par lagbhag sateek anumaanon se hi bani he
 How can anyone compromise their credibility in this profession? Surveys are not new to getting public opinion on various issues
 apane desh main 1957 ke aam chunaavon main pehali dfa erik di costa ke netritv main indian institute of public opinian ne janamat surveykshan kiya
 He is considered the initiator of surveys in India
 dashak bhar pehle jab chunaav ayog ne janamat surveykshanon par roak lagane kii maang kii to tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ne use khaarij kar diya tha
 Opposing the ban on public opinion polls in 2004, the then Attorney General Soli Sorabjee had said that every such attempt of ban would be unconstitutional
 unhone haal main kaha, ''aisi daleelein vibhinn janamat or matdaan baad surveykshanon ko samajhane main ausat naagarik kii buddhi par shaq kii vajah se hi di jaati hai
 Please do not underestimate the average citizen

 He has written that he has received two installments of Kisan Samman Yojana

 is kaaran aapako ayogy ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 If you improve your name, but clicking on the link given, the page was under construction
 haridwar ke kisaan ne kaha ki uske baad kisaan tehsil jane lage
 a crowd of farmers came from other villages

 The message sender claims that half the beneficiaries in his village have been reduced
 kisaan ke kahe anusaar main pmkisan

 This page was updated on 3 October 2019
 pehali kisht ke vakt 6 karod 76 lakh 48 hazaar 485 labhaarthi bataae gaye the
 The first installment was released on 1 December 2018
 duusari kisht ke samay yah sankhya ghat jaati he
 One crore farmers fall short
 website kii soochna ke anusaar duusari kisht ke labhaarthiyon kii sankhya 5 karod 14 lakh 20 hazaar 802 he
 According to the third installment, 1 crore 74 lakh 20 thousand 230
 yani labhaarthi kisaanon kii sankhya kam hoti gai
 By the third installment, more than 5 crore farmers were reduced
 kisi ko pataa hi nahin chalaa
 If the name did not match with the Aadhaar card, on what basis were the farmers given money in the first and second installment
 agar gajaati se die gaye to kya paise waapas nahin liye jane chahie? do kishton ke bich chah se saat maheene kaa vakt tha
 Suddenly when the election is over, 5 crore farmers are reduced directly
 hisaab lagaaein to 13 hazaar karod galat paatro ko diya gaya
 Is it not a scam? The number of beneficiaries at the time of first installment in Maharashtra was 61 lakh 34 thousand 366
 duusari kisht main yah sankhya aadhi ho jaati he
 31 lakh 91 thousand becomes 953
 magar teesri kisht main kisaanon kii sankhya ghat kar 6 lakh 63 hazaar 837 ho gai he
 In Uttar Pradesh, 1 crore 62 lakh 04 thousand 468 farmers got the first installment
 teesri kisht ke vakt labhaarthi kii sankhya 44 lakh 59 hazaar 007 ho gai he
 The same situation exists in other states
 sarkaar ke paas paise nahin hai
 Is there any way to cut the installment in all these ways? First installment is December 31, 2018
 3
 To be given between 2019
 chunaav chal rahe the
 So money was given fast
 sabake khate main 2000 rupee gaye
 Then 2000 also went to the second installment, but how much can it be reduced during the third installment
 niyamavali main he ki aadhaar anivaary he
 If there is no Aadhaar, then others can take money on the basis of identity, but will have to deposit Aadhaar later
 agar aadhaar kii gadabadi thi to sarkaar ko abhiyaan chalaakar aisa karnaa chahie tha na ki esemes se bhej kar kisaanon ko bhatkaana tha
 The tehsil also had to know
 kya suvidha ke hisaab se aadhaar ko lekar maanak tay kar diya jaataa he ki naam nahin match kar rahaa to naak nahin match kar rahaa

 According to the Supreme Court's decision, the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board is seeking legal opinion on the matter of taking or not taking five acres of land for the construction of a mosque in Ayodhya and says that it is going to Lucknow on Sunday
 In the meeting of All India Muslim Personal Law Board held in I, the decision to be taken in this regard will give special importance
 board ke adhyaksh jufar faruki ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki sunni vakf board ayodhya main zamin lene yaa na lene ke masale par muslim personal lau board ke nirnay ko khaas ahmiyat degaa
 He said that the Muslim Personal Law Board was not a party to the Ayodhya case, but it is undoubtedly the most recognized institution of Muslims in the country, hence it is legitimate to give importance to its decision
 faruki ne kaha ki philhal sawaal yah he ki kya sunni vakf board masjid nirmaan ke liye supreme court ke aadesh par di jane vaali paanch acre zamin lene se inkaar kar saktaa he, or kahin aisa karnaa adaalat kii avmaananaa to nahin hogi, iske liye board ne kanoonee raay lenaa shuru kar diya he
 He said on a question that people have different opinions about taking land and there is very less number of people who intend to give a message to the whole world by doing any constructive work on that land
 baharhaal, board 26 november ko hone vaali apni baithak main is silsile main koi faisla karegaa

 On the question of what would happen if the Sunni Waqf Board and the Muslim Personal Law Board had different opinions on the issue of land acquisition, Jilani said that the Sunni Waqf Board was not the only party in the Ayodhya case, but rather the Muslim As a representation of the side, the Sunni board cannot take a decision alone in this regard
 maaloom ho ki supreme court ne 9 november ko ayodhya maamle main faisla sunaate hue vivaadit sthal par ram mandir ke nirmaan or muslim paksh ko masjid banane ke liye ayodhya main paanch acre zamin sunni vakf board ko uplabdh karaane kaa aadesh diya tha
 The Sunni Waqf Board was the main party on behalf of the Muslims in this matter
 sunni vakf board ke adhyaksh faruki kaa masjid nirmaan ke liye zamin lene ke maamle par kahana tha ki sakaaraatmakataa ke zariye hi nakaaratmakataa ko khatm kiya ja saktaa he

 Desperate to enter Pakistan's politics, Hafiz Saeed has started getting irritated with the word terrorist attached to his worldwide identity
 haalankikukhyat aatanki hafiz saidke aatankwaad kii duniya jo bade-bade kaale karname kiye hai, wo uski is pahchaan ko kabhi mitane nahin denge
 So his desire to enter politics cannot be fulfilled
 pakistan main aam chunaav ke liye mahaj ek saal kaa hi vakt bachaa he
 Earlier, Hafiz Saeed filed a petition in the United Nations demanding that his name be removed from the list of global terrorists
 iske liye usne pehali baar ek kanoonee form ko hair kiya he
 His intention is to get rid of the word terrorist and come into Pakistan politics
 haalanki agar pakistan ne hafiz said ko raajnneeti main laane kii galati kii, to duniya bhar main usko fajihat jhelni padegi
 Hafiz Saeed has been a professor of Arabic language and engineering, but later he majored in engineering of terrorist-generating machinery in Pakistan
 yah baat bahut hi kam logon ko maaloom hogi ki hafiz said ne afghanistan main aatankwaad failaane ke liye saal 1985 main jamaat-ud-daawa-val irshaad kii sthapana kii thi
 After this, in the year 1990, the terrorist eye sight of Hafeez Saeed shifted from Afghanistan to Kashmir
 usne kashmir main aatanki ghatnaon ko anjaam dene vaale sabase bade pakistani sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba ko taiyaar kiya
 On 26 December 2001, the United States declared lashkar-e-taiba an international terrorist organization
 bharat main sansad hamale se lekar 26 / 11 mumbai hamale tak ko anjaam dene main lashkar kaa hi haath rahaa he
 Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 26 / 11 attack in Mumbai, started the jamaat-ud-dawa in 2008
 hafiz said or pakistan donon ise cheritable trust bataate hai, jabaki america or sanyukt raashtra (UN) ne jamaat-ud-daawa ko bain kiya hua he
 America has placed Hafiz Saeed in second place in the list of people responsible for terrorism in the world
 itnaa hi nahin, america ne hafiz said ke sir par ek karod dollar kaa inam bhi ghoshit kiya hua he
 Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack, is also included in the list of India's most wanted terrorists
 aatankwaad se hafiz said kaa naata itnaa gaharaa or purana he ki uski karatuuton kii list sunate-sunate aap thak jaaenge
 In short, Hafiz Saeed is the number one player of terrorism in the world and no one can snatch this identity from him
 vah lakh koshish karne baavjood is kukhyati se baahar nahin aa saktaa he
 The campaign launched against the forced conversion of Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghuvar Das seems to be exasperating to government officials
 is silsile main bhartiya prashasnic seva kii adhikari vandana dadel ne apane fasebuk acount par ek post daalaa he
 On October 20, on this post, Daddell has questioned the state government's campaign against conversion

 He has posted a post in this regard on his Facebook account that when questions are raised about the religion and conversion of tribals even in government programs, then the question arises in the mind
 kya is rajya main adivasee ko swechha se, sammaan se apana dharm chunane kaa bhi ab adhikaar nahin rah gaya he? aakhir kyon achaanak adivaasiyon ke dharm parivartan par auron ko chintaa hone lagi he, jabaki ashiksha, berogari or kuposhan jaisi kitni hi gambhir samasyaon se samaaj jujh rahaa he
 'vandana Dadel has described this post as her personal comment
 siem ne jabaran dharm parivartan par uthaae the sawalrajya kemukhyamantri raghuvar dasbeete kuch dinon se lagaataar adivaasiyon kaa dharm parivartan karaane vaale padariyon ko jail bhejne kii baat kah rahe hai
 He recently commented on the conversion while addressing a gram sabha in Kathikund block of Dumka
 apane sambodhan main mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki kuch log hamaari samskruti or parampara ko nasht karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 To convert by giving greed or temptation is a crime
 unhone logon kaa aahvaan kiya tha ki jo aapke dharm or samskruti par chot yaa aanch pahunchane kii koshish kare, use pakad kar police ke hawaale karo
 Earlier, at the inauguration ceremony of the State BJPJP Working Committee, the Chief Minister had said that the clergy who are converting are in jail and they will send them to jail

 Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Ramshankar Katheria, who was sworn in recently, may face a case of forgery in the university's marksheet
 is maamle par katheria ne kaha he ki vah agar doshi sabit hue to mantri hi nahin, saansad pad se bhi istipha de denge
 In fact, in 2010, his anti-bsp candidate filed a complaint of forgery and dishonesty against him, and alleged that Katheria forged his BA second year and MA final marksheets to get a lecturer job at Agra University
 
 haalanki rajyamantri kaa daawa he ki yah puraa maamla raajnneetik or bogus he, or unhone rajya ke shiksha vibhaag kii jaanch main clin chit milane kaa bhi daawa kiya
 The Allahabad High Court has dismissed the objection of Katheria, and ordered the Agra Sessions Court to hear the case
 maamle kii sunwaayee ab 26 november ko hogi
 If Katheria is found guilty in this case, he can be punished for up to seven years
 enditivi ke paas court main pesh kii gai marksheet kii pratiyaan hai, jinhen farji bataaya ja rahaa he, or aarope he ki jaalsaji ek baar nahin, do baar kii gai
 Katheria is also accused of forgery in the MA final marksheet
 bataaya gaya ki saahitiyik lekhan ke siddhanton vishay main unhen 38 number mili tha, lekin unki kathith nakli marksheet 72 number bataa rahi he
 The marksheet of BA second year is also being said to be fake, because in Hindi literature where they got 43 numbers, 53 numbers were recorded in the marksheet being said to be fake
 saath hi isi tarah angrezi main bhi farji marksheet main 52 number mili dikhaae gaye hai, jabaki bataaya gaya ki unhen vastav main 42 number mili the
 Recently, the Supreme Court said that he was sure that the Prime Minister would not include a leader with serious criminal charges in his cabinet, but Ram Shankar Katheria, a two-time MP from Agra, has been made Minister of State in the Ministry of Human Resource Development

 Can a dead man ever be alive? People of one area in Delhi are upset over this question
 iske peeche vajah ye he ki yahaan pehle ek shaks kaa katl kar diya jaataa he
 The police retrieve the corpse, and then the householders identify it
 mohalle ke saikadon log laash dekh kar matampursi karte hai or-to-or, antim sanskaar ke baad asthiyon kaa visarjan or terahavin tak kar di jaati he
 But exactly 27 days later, the man returns home again
 apane shuhar ko ankhon ke saamne dekh kar bivi hairaan he
 Fainted due to fear
 apane papa ko paas aate dekh kar bachche dur bhaag rahe hai
 On finding her son in front, the mother started crying bitterly
 or chote bhai ko to apane ankhon par hi yakeen nahin ho rahaa
 But the question is, what is it like with Dharam Singh? Why is someone running away, someone is crying, some is faint and some are not able to believe their eyes? After all, why has Dharam Singh become a hoax in spite of everyone? The answer to all your questions is that Dharam Singh is dead
 ji haa, aapane bilkul sahi padhaa,uski maut ho chuki he
 But in spite of that, he not only stands upright before everyone's eyes
 balki kisi bhi duusare insaan kii tarah baaten bhi kar rahaa he or apane chaaron ore ke is maahaul se hairaan bhi ho rahaa he
 Now you must be thinking how is this possible? The person who is dead gharavaalon ne jisaki laash kaa khud apane haathon se antim sanskaar kiya ho
 Moreover, after the thirteenth, with all the customs, people whose bones have flowed into the Garhganga
 vahi shaks bhala sabaki ankhon ke saamne bilkul sahi-salaamat kaise khadaa ho saktaa he? aakhir wo jinda kaise ho saktaa he
 So sir, this is the puzzle
 jisane naa sirf dharam singh ke gharavaalon ko, balkidilli ke badali ilakemen rahanevaale saikadon logon ko buree tarah ulajhaa diya he
 Rather, the situation now is that Dharam Singh goes through, where weak hearted people lurk
 auraten behosh ho jaati hai
 People get fever
 baat zyada puraani nahin, sirf 27 rose pehle kii he, jab logon ne dharam singh ko murda dekha tha
 The police had recovered his body
 gali-mohalle ke logon ke saath-saath khud uske gharavaalon ne bhi laash kii pahchaan kii thi
 Along with Dharam Singh's clothes, many special marks on the body were just like his body
 yanisbako ye tasalliho chuki thi ki maranevaala unka betaa dharam singh hi he
 But exactly 27 days after all this, Dharam Singh suddenly arrived at his house
 use jisane bhi gali se guzarate hue dekha, bas dekhtaa rah gaya
 Thinking of him as a ghost, someone got sweaty
 tokoi dar ke maare chillanelaga
 Leave it to the non-residents, even after seeing their son alive, the family members themselves were in bad condition
 lekin sawaal ye he ki aakhir ye paheli kya he? ek murda insaan ke achaanak jinda hone kii ye kahani kya he? or agar ye shaks dharam singh hi he, to phir gharavaalon ne jisaki laash kaa antim sanskaar kiya tha, wo koun he? to ek murda ke jinda hone kii ye kahani jitani pechida he, iske peeche kii hakeekat utani hi chaunkaane vaali
 He did not die any common death, rather he was beaten to death in the accusations of conspiracy among hundreds
 or phir jab laash kii shinaakht karne kii baari ai to gharavaalon ne dekha ki thik dharam singh kii tarah hi laash kaa ek daant tutaa hua he, ek haath kii oongli kati hui he
 That is, everyone was dead on Dharam Singh's death
 lekin isi bich kahani palat jaati he
 This story of a corpse being alive began on Sunday 23 August 2015
 dilli ke badali ilaake main der raat kuch logon kii najar achaanak ilaake main gum rahe kuch choron par padi
 People immediately came out of the houses and the siege of thieves was started
 bhanak lagane par baaki to bhaag nikle, lekin ek chor bheed ke hathe chadh gaya
 Just what then? People beat him so much that he died on the spot
 ab subah hote-hote police bhi mauka-e-vaardaat par thi
 Police tried to ascertain the identity of the deceased
 or jald hi use ye pataa chal gaya ki takreeban 30 saal kii umr kaa ye shaks paas hi kii gali main rahanevaala dharam singh he, jo vaise to trek driver he, lekin shaayad is roj chori ke iraade se gum rahaa tha
 Now the police sent the corpse and sent it for the post-mortem, along with Dharam Singh's family members to be identified
 gharavaale laash dekhte hi dahaade maar kar rone lage unke mutabik ye dharam singh hi tha
 He also wore clothes like Dharam Singh and he also had a broken tooth in front
 or to or dharam singh kii tarah hi uske bhi haath hi ek ungali kati hui thi
 That is, age one, clothes another and the mark in the body is also one
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki laash ko pahchaanane main shaq kii koi gunjaaish nahin thi
 Therefore, after the identification of the family members, the police handed over the corpse to them after law formalities
 baap or bhai pehle hhospataal mendharam singh kii laash pahchaan chuke the
 On reaching home, Dharam Singh's wife also fainted after seeing the body of his husband, and even his mother fell down after eating a gasp
 bachche bhi rone lage
 Like this, weeds were engulfed in the entire locality
 dharam singh ke gharavaalon ne takreeban 30 hajaar rupye kharch kar mohalle waalon ke saath milakar paas hi ke shmashaan ghat main uskaa antim sanskaar kar diya
 After this, time passed, and life again started catching pace
 lekin dharam singh kii maut kaa ye maamla tab apane sir ke bal khadaa ho gaya, jab maut ke thik 27 roj baad yani 18 sitambar ko dharam singh achaanak apane ghar waapas aa gaya
 Actually, Dharam Singh was first seen by someone in a nearby market and then came running to his brother Gaurav
 usne bataaya ki dharam singh jinda ho chukaa he or bazaar main gum rahaa he
 But all the other people of the house, including Gaurav, were surprised when Dharam Singh arrived at his home shortly after
 ab sawaal ye tha ki aakhir dharam singh itane dinon tak kahaan rahaa? or agar yahi dharam singh he, to phir jisaki maut hui thi, wo koun he? mobile phone ke is daur main jab har shaks ek-duusare se choubison ghante judaa rahata he, tab dharam singh kii is rahasyamayi gumshudagi kaa raaj kya tha? aakhir jab dharam singh kii maut par har koi ro rahaa tha, uski laash kaa antim sanskaar ho rahaa tha tab asli dharam singh kahaan chupa baitha tha? dharam singh ke dobaaraa jinda ho jane yaa phir yun kahen ki uske ghar laut aane kii khushi par logon kii hairaani haaavee thi
 Now the question was in everyone's mind that if he is Dharam Singh then where was he for so long? When the whole area was submerged in his death weeds
 gharavaale uski laash kii pahchaan kar rahe the
 People of the neighborhood were coming to console the family, where was Dharam Singh? Moreover, when his bones were being shed in Garhganga, where was he? After all, why did he not call the family even once for so many days that he was alive, safe and sound
 jabaki ye daur mobile phone kaa he, or aaj shaayad hi koi aisa shaks he, jiske paas mobile nahin he
 So Dharam Singh had the answer to every such question
 dharam singh kii maane to chunki wo trek chalaata he, is vaakye ke kuch rose pehle hi wo paas hi sanjay gandhi transport nagar se maal samet trek le kar delivery ke liye nikal gaya tha
 After that he went to Assam, Bihar and Jharkhand too
 or is tarah kai rajyon or bahut se shaharon se hota hua wo 18 sitambar ko phir se dilli laut aayaa
 Dharam Singh also argued for the paper of his and truck's entry in all the states and in different places in his favor
 haalanki jab khud dharam singh ghar ke tamaam logon ko or ghar ke log dharam singh ko pahchaan rahe the, to bhi aisi daleel or uske tasdik kii koi jarurat nahin bachi thi
 However, the fact that Dharam Singh was alive is now clear, but the attitude of his disappearance for so many days was still under question
 dharam singh agar pehle hi apane gharavaalon ko phone kar letaa
 So perhaps this story of his life and death is not so long
 lekin aakhir kyon nahin kiya dharam singh ne aisa?darasal, wo sharaab pine kii apni aadat ko lekar gharavaalon se hue jhagade se naaraaz tha
 The reason behind this is Dharam Singh's habit of drinking and drinking
 khud dharam singh kii maane to use sharaab pine kaa kaaphi shauk he
 And for this reason, he often has differences with his family members
 or isi vajah se is baar jab wo trek lekar apane kaam par gaya, to usne itane dinon tak ek baar phir apane gharavaalon se baat karne yaa unhen phone karne kii koshish nahin kii
 But upon reaching here, when he came to know about his death and the grief of his family members, he realized how heavy his alcohol addiction was to him
 haalanki dharam singh kii vaapasi ne ab police ke liye nayaa sawaal khadaa kar diya he ki aakhir wo aadhi raat ko public kii pitayee se maaraa janevaala wo shaks koun tha? Alok Verma has been removed from the post of CBI Director in the ongoing controversy in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)

 Twitter has deleted the account of Pakistan Defense for sharing fake photos of Indian girl and posting fake

 Pakistan had been running propaganda against India with its Twitter handle for a long time
 vah lagaataar bharat virdohi twit kar rahaa tha or farji tasveeron ko share kar rahaa tha
 Twitter considered it a serious violation of the rules and suspended the Pakistan defense's Twitter account

 pakistan pehle bhi bharat ke khilaaf propaganda chalaane ke liye farji tasviir kaa sahaara le chukaa he
 Earlier, Pakistan's Ambassador to the United Nations, Maliha Lodhi, showed a picture of a Palestinian victim, calling her an Indian girl

 Interestingly, this Indian girl is smiling
 twitor ne pakistan kii is harakat ko niyamon kaa ulanghan mana or uske dephence handle ko suspend kar diya
 Fake picture was also shown in UN to encircle India
 Earlier, in September, Pakistan tried to surround India on the international stage with a fake image, but its forgery was caught

 input: IANS Sensational revelations have been made about Honeypreet Insan, the closest ruler of Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who has been absconding since last month
 jahaan ek ore police daawa kar rahi he ki 25 agast ko ram rahim ke jail jane ke baad se haniprit faraar he or uskaa koi suraag nahin mil rahaa he, vahiin khabar aa rahi he ki haniprit rohtak jail se hi underground nahin hui thi

 dilachasp baat yah he ki is dauraan deraa ko haryana police or sena ne puri tarah se apane kabje main le rakhaa tha
 Now the question is arising that when the dera was sealed by the Haryana Police and Army, how did Honeypreet disappear from there? After Ram Rahim went to jail, Honeypreet stayed in the camp on the night of August 25 and 26, so why did the police and the army not get the idea of it? Why did no one know about his arrival from Rohtak jail on August 25? It is also being said that Honeypreet has gone underground from the camp
 haalanki police yah daawa kar rahi he ki ram rahim ke jail jane ke baad se haniprit rohtak jail se hi underground ho gai
 She is still absconding and cannot find any clue
 udhar, haryana sarkaar kaa daawa he ki ram rahim ke jail jane ke baad sirsa sthit deraa sachcha sauda ko sil kar diya gaya tha
 a joint team of Haryana and Rajasthan police also reached Nepal in search of Honeypreet, but had to return empty-handed

 After coming to know about the news of Honeypreet's escape to Nepal, the joint team of Haryana and Rajasthan not only reached there, but photos were sent on social media to find out
 saath hi nepal main chowk-chauraahon par poster lagaae gaye or radio stesan se baqayda haniprit ke faraar hone kii khabar chalaai gai
 If Honeypreet is arrested, many more secrets of Ram Rahim can be exposed
 mana ja rahaa he ki vah ram rahim kii sabase badi raajadaar he
 Vipassana, the chairperson of the Dera Sacha Sauda, was also questioned by the Special Investigation Team about Honeypreet
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vipashyana ne ram rahim ke jail jane ke baad haniprit se baatcheet hone kii baat kabuuli thi
 It is also believed that during the interrogation, Vipassana confirmed Honeypreet to be in the camp on the night of August 25 and 26

 aam aadmi party ke rashtriya sanyojak or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar jhelane ke baad soshal media par phir sakriy ho gaye hai
 Arvind Kejriwal has uploaded the new cover photo on his Facebook page
 jisapar likhaa hua he 'ladenge jeetenge'
 The Aam Aadmi Party has called a meeting of party workers at the Punjabi Bagh Club on 26 May to review the strategy for the upcoming assembly elections in Delhi, reviewing the reasons for the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 darasal, kuch hi maheenon ke baad dilli main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Arvind Kejriwal, who won 67 out of 70 seats in the 2015 assembly elections, faces a major challenge after losing seven seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 AAP ne dilli, haryana or punjab main loksabhaa chunaav maidan ke liye apane ummidavaar utaare the
 In which all the candidates of the party have lost the election except one seat in Punjab

 Hence, he vented his anger on the party's defeat in this way
 ‘pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bachapan main chaay bechi thi yaa nahin’, ye sawaal beete kai varshon se charchaa main bana hua he
 Now Praveen Togadia, who once worked with Narendra Modi on this issue, has given a big statement
 vishwa hindu parishad ke purv pramukh praveen togadiya kaa daawa he ki vah narendra modi ko 43 saal se jaanate hai, lekin unhone kabhi unhen chaay bechate nahin dekha
 Togadia claimed that this is just a publicity stunt and nothing else
 media se baat karte hue togadiya ne kaha ki maine doctorl kii he, agar aap mere doston yaa jaan-pahchaan waalon se puuchhenge to unase bhi is baat ke saboot milenge, lekin narendra modi ke ‘chaay bechney’ ke daawey ko koi sabit nahin kar paaegaa
 It is worth mentioning that Praveen Togadia has once again been talking about agitation with his new organization International Hindu Council for the construction of Ram temple
 isi dauraan unhone bhartiya janata party or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said that the BJP-RSS has no intention of building a Ram temple
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi or aresas ke bhaiyaji joshi ke bayaan se ye saaf ho gaya he ki agle paanch saal main bhi ram mandir nahin banane ja rahaa he
 Both these organizations have kept the people of the country in the dark, but now the Hindu has woken up
 is dauraan unhone elaan kiya ki vah 9 farvari ko nai raajnneetik party kaa elaan karenge, agar wo party satta main aati he to sansad main kanoon laakar ram mandir kaa nirmaan kiya jayega
 Commenting on Narendra Modi, he said that if he can bring a law at midnight for the triple talaq bill, then why not do it for the temple
 unhone kaha ki agar modi dobaaraa pradhanmantri bhi ban jate hai phir vah mandir nahin banaaenge
 Praveen Togadia claimed that if BJP loses elections in 2019, Narendra Modi will return to Gujarat and Bhaiyaji Joshi will also return to Nagpur
 chunaav najadik aate hi rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne ghoshnaaon kii jhadi laga di he
 In fact, the state government has announced to increase the pension of democracy fighters
 iske mutabik rajasthan main loktantr senaniyon kaa pension 12 hajaar prati maah se badhaakar 20 hajaar prati maah kar diya gaya he 
 Earlier, the Hivasundhara government had changed the name of MISA detainees jailed during the Emergency to Democracy Fighter
 in loktantr senaniyon kaa medical bill bhi 2 hajaar prati maah se badhaakar 4 hajaar tak kar diya gaya he
 Not only this, now democracy fighters will also be able to travel for free in Rajasthan Roadways buses
 vasundhara raaje ne kaha ki yah ghoshnaa apatkaal kii barsi par 26 june ko honi thi lekin kisi vajah se nahin ho saki lekin ise ab kii ja rahi he
 He said that it should be implemented immediately, there should be no delay in it
 ye he raaje sarkaar kaa maksadais baar rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bijepi chaahati he ki loktantra senaanee ke naam par bujurgon kii ek aisi fouj khadi ho jo logon ko congress ke apatkaal ke dauraan kii jyadatiyon ke bare main bataae
 With this announcement, BJP will reach the house of all those democracy fighters and in a way they will be used in elections in the name of securing democracy
 vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle is tarah kii ghoshnaaon ko chunavi ghoshnaa mana ja rahaa he
 However, how much benefit Raje government will get from this will tell the results of the elections
 chhattisgarh main aaj pehle charan ke liye 18 siton par matdaan ho rahaa he
 Meanwhile, campaigning for the second phase is still on
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne aaj chhattisgarh ke bilaspur main badi raily ko sambodhit kiya
 Let us know that earlier also the PM addressed the rally in Jagdalpur
 apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat pradhanmantri narendra modi ne chhattisgarh bhashaa main kii
 The Prime Minister said that i have worked in Bilaspur for many years
 piem bole ki chhattisgarh hindustan ke dhan kaa katoraa he
 There are people who believe in Kabir, who give the message of peace
 PM ne kaha ki chhattisgarh kii seva karne kaa hamen baar-baar mauka mila he uskaa ek kaaran he ki yahaan kii janata or sarkaar ke bich main sanghathan ke kaaryakartaaon kii majboot kadi hona he
 Today the first phase of voting is taking place, people should vote more and more
 unhone kaha ki bam-bandook kaa dam dikhaane waalon ko vot se jawaab diya jayega
 The Prime Minister said that every election since 1952 was fought in the name of family, caste, meri-tere
 lekin bijepi ne chunaav ke agenda ko badla, hamane jati, oonch-neech ko chhod vikaas ko apana mukhya agenda banaaya
 Opponents do not understand how to counter BJP
 PM modi ne kaha ki virdohi bataaen ki kya kaaran tha ki chhattisgarh jab madhyapradesh kaa hissaa tha to donon hi bimaaru rajya the
 If Chhattisgarh had remained with them even after it was built, it would have taken 50 years to build it like today

 Once again, talks have started regarding captain MS Dhoni's batting position, but former captain Sunil Gavaskar has insisted on playing batsmen like 5th and 6th batsmen Manish Pandey and Kedar Jadhav above pressure
 bharat-newzealand vanade series ke barabari par aate hi team india ke khilaadi, team management or team ke captain emes dhoni kii ore ungliyaan uthne lagi hai
 Many experts are also hinting at the murky tongue of Dhoni's batting position

 According to him, Dhoni and Rohit Sharma have also proved their ability many times before
 tippaniyan Former captain Sunil Gavaskar says, "the number six and seventh batsmen should carry their responsibilities
 ham rohit sharma or dhoni par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 But he has proved his ability first

 unke mutabik dhoni or rohit sharma ne bhi pehle kai baar apni kaabiliyatsabit kii he
 The comments purv captain sunil gavaskar kehete hai, "chathe or saatven number ke ballebaazon ko apni zimmedaari nibhaani chahie
 We are questioning Rohit Sharma and Dhoni

 Bungalow politics is at the peak of the formation of Congress government in Madhya Pradesh
 mukhyamantri kamalnath ne bangala politics ke tahat sabase pehle purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko bangala alot kiya tha
 After this, the second bungalow was allotted to former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh
 purv mukhyamantri shivaraj kaa nayaa ashiana ab wo bangala hoga jo kendriya mantri sushamaa swaraj ke naam par alot tha
 Shivraj got Sushma Swaraj's bungalow
 Now the time has come for Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who was the head of the state for 13 years, to change his whereabouts
 bhale hi hai court ke aadesh par purv mukhyamantriyon ko bangala khaali karaane vaale aadesh ke baad shivaraj sarkaar ne 6 maheene pehle 4 purv mukhyamantriyon- kailash joshi, uma bharti, babulal gaur ko apane visheshadhikaar ke tahat bangale main bane rahane kaa farmaan jari kar meharbaani rakhi thi
 At the same time, Digvijay Singh was rendered homeless
 lekin ab congress kii sarkaar banate hi kamalnath ne sabase pehle purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko bangala alot kiya he
 The new bungalow has been allotted to Shivraj Singh Chauhan as an MLA
 ye bangala pehle kendriya mantri sushamaa swaraj ko alot tha
 Shivraj has been given a C-7 bungalow in Professor Colony
 iskaa aadesh bhi kamalnath ne shapath grahan vaale din hi jari kar diya tha
 However, before moving to this bungalow, former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan will reside in B8 located in 74 bungalows
 C-7 kaa renovations kaa kaam jari he
 Not only did Digvijay return to 'bungalow', even if the change of power in Madhya Pradesh, former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh also got a bungalow in Shyamala Hills
 kuch maheene pehle hi digvijay singh ko court ke aadesh ke baad bangala khaali karnaa padaa tha
 After this, Digvijay Singh sometimes stayed in hotels in Bhopal, sometimes in a house in Chunabhatti area, but now soon he will go back to the bungalow in Shayamala Hills
 is niyam ke tahat die gaye bangaleye bangale mukhyamantri kamalnath ne shaskeey awaas aavanton niyam 2000 kii dhara 10 ke tahat die hai jiske tahat rajya shashan ganmaanya nagarikon, raajnneetik partiyon or saamaajik sanghathanon ko license shulk ke saath makaan de sakati hai
 Meanwhile, on the question that in the BJP government, where the bungalow was evacuated from Digvijay Singh, while the Congress government first gave the bungalow to Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the BJP seems to be giving its own arguments
 bijepi pravaktaa rahul kothaati ne bolaa ki digvijay ne shivaraj se bangala maanga hota to jarur miltaa
 It is wrong to say that BJP did not give Digvijay Singh a bungalow

 (diksha priyadarshi itmi kii chaatr hai or india today main prashikshu hai)*** Ever since Ashok Gehlot became the Chief Minister, the sword has been hanging on liquor vendors
 iskaa kaaran shaayad yah he ki gahalot sharaab ko haath bhi nahin lagaate hai
 But liquor vendors opposed the policies of the Chief Minister on August 26, like never before
 unhone rajyavyapee hadtaal kar di
 The outrage started in 2009 itself
 tab mukhyamantri rahe ashok gahalot ne pehali baar raat 8 baje ke baad sharaab kii bikri par roak lagane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 In August this year, after hearing complaints from customers about overcharging and keeping the shop open even after 8 pm, Gehlot took strict steps and directed the officers to seal the shops and cancel the licenses if necessary
 pichley hakrate rajya ke atirikt mukhya sachiv (vitt) niranjan arya ne unke khilaaf karrwai tej karne kaa faisla kiya
 Around 270 raids were conducted against liquor vendors, with heavy economic penalties and firs registered against them
 chhaapon se sharaab vikreta naaraaz ho gaye or chah bade iemfel-bikri jilon main 26 agast ko hadtaal par chale gaye
 He refused to buy liquor from the distribution centers operated by the state government until 2 September
 kareeb 15,000 karod ru
 The tax-raising liquor industry is the second largest source of revenue in the state — but because of this, liquor in Rajasthan is about one and a half times more expensive than in neighboring states
 sharaab vikritaon kaa kahana he ki bikri teji se ghati he
 They say that the liquor vendors have stolen silver from the neighboring states
 hadtaal ke kaaran sarkaar 2005 se chali aa rahi samasyaon kii taraf dhyaan dene par majaboor ho sakati he
 In 2005, the Vasundhara government changed the auction system — in which liquor sellers could buy liquor directly from liquor manufacturers
 nilaamee kii jagah lottery aadhaarit aavanton shuru kar diya gaya tha or sarkaar ekmaatr vikreta ho gai thi
 Under that policy, each license holder could take a net profit of 20 percent, but they were prohibited from selling at less than 10 percent profit
 jaipur main sharaab ke ek dealer mohammad younus kehete hai, ''isse rajya ke rajasav main lagaataar badhotaree hoti rahi he
 But for some time, the government has been forced to share the additional cost, along with economic penalties and charges, which has reduced our profits to 12 percent
 ''kuch vikreta emarpy se zyada keemat vasuulne kii baat sweekaar karte hai, lekin unka aarope he ki sarkaar aksar unhen aisi botalon ko aapurti karti he jin par puraani keemten likhi hoti hai
 The strike has so far cost the government Rs 50 crore
 kaa nuksaan ho chukaa he
 But if the government does not improve the excise policy soon, the smuggling of liquor may cause further damage
