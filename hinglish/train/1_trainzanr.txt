 Parrikar has accused Rahul of political opportunism
 parrikar ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki aap apane raajnneetik phaayde ke liye mujhase milane aae

 Parrikar condemned Rahul Gandhi's statement in which Rahul said that during Tuesday's meeting Parrikar had told him that he had no knowledge of the Rafael deal

 After this, hal's contract was taken away

 unhone kaha ki samiti main is baar takreeban 60 sadsy the
 He was also included in this committee
 unhone ise jatil bataaya
 Asked whether the Congress has failed to capitalize on 'fixed deposits' (good work done by him as Chief Minister between 1999-2004)? He said, 'to take advantage of the good work done by the previous leaders, one should have cleverness, intelligence and political acumen
 jo yah kehete hai ki isaki jarurat nahin he to yah unka nuksaan he
 It is not their loss that earned it
 ’purv mukhyamantri ne is baat kii bhavishyavaanee karne se inkaar kar diya ki koun-si party satta main aegi
 He said, 'the mandate is difficult to predict
 log rahasy (kise ve matdaan karenge) saajha nahin karte
 Many times, the election worsens, because the people who are contacted give misleading information
 ’krishna ne kaha ki jab 1999 main congress ne shandaar jeet hasil kii thi to party ke karnataka maamalon ke tatkaaleen prabharee gulam nabi aaazaad ne peeth main gambhir dard ke baavjood saamne se party ke prayaason kaa netritv kiya tha

" ’ krishna kaa vahaan kathith taur par sine abhinayta se netaa bane ech ambareesh ke saath vivaad chal rahaa he
 Asked if he was depressed by the current politics (by himself being sidelined), Krishna said, 'politics never gets depressed' and he quoted Douglas macarthur's speech as saying, 'old soldiers never die 
 ve sirf kamjor ho gaye hai
 This Congress leader said, 'I am not just sitting at home and contemplating
 mere or bhi shauk hai jaise sangeet, tennis or yoga
 i get great satisfaction from them
 ’ krishna kii raay thi ki chunaav purv ghoshnaa patr ne maujuuda samay main apana aadhaar or praasangikta kho di he
 Krishna, who stayed away from the party's release of election manifesto, said, "the ruling party remembers the election manifesto only when someone reminds it and when the leader of the opposition mentions it during discussion in the assembly
" us vakt koi vidhaan saudha, rajya sachivalay main isaki prati nahin paata he or unhen congress karyaalay se hasil karnaa padataa he
 ' in sabhi college main chaatro kii sankhya main koi kami nahin he
 Somewhere there are studying a thousand and somewhere two to three thousand must be studying

 Do you know what happens to them? ve bina professor-lekturer ke kya pard kar nikalate honge
 a national project to destroy the jawans is going on in all the states of the country
 aapkaa dhyaan is taraf jaae hi na, isliye netaa subah se lekar shaam tak tarah tarah ke mudde garh rahe hai
 When there are no teachers in this country, how are students studying? bagair guru ke kya bharat vishwa guru ho saktaa he
 These conditions have been there for many years
 bihar se lekar rajasthan, upi se lekar madhya pradesh tak har jagah shiksha kaa bajet sirf imaaraton ke rakh rakhaav main kharch ho rahaa he
 Nothing is happening on the teachers
 lalit narayan mithila uniwarsity kaa haal bahut bura he
 But why the people of these areas did not show this condition is beyond my understanding
 hamane ye sara data uniwarsity ke bajet se liya he jo rajya sarkaar ke paas bheja jaataa he
 According to the budget letter for 2017-18, 1918 posts are approved in the entire university, but since 1918, only 488 teachers are teaching
 1430 pad khaali hai
 Less than 50 percent of the professors themselves, how is this university going
 chaatro ko professor nahin mil rahe hai, ve barbaad ho rahe hai, jo professor ho sakate the unhen naukari nahin mil rahi he
 They are also being ruined
 isi tarah non teaching main bhi 1099 pad khaali hai
 Governments have stopped hiring
 college or uniwarsity kii imaarat hi chamakati nazar aa rahi he magar sabake sab khandhar main badal gaye hai
 You will not see any leader speaking on these subjects
 kaise bonlege, phir unhen bataanaa padegaa ki in collejon main shikshak kyon nahin hai ou kab tak honge
 After all, how did the people of Madhunbi, Begusarai and Darbhanga accept this decline of their colleges
 1940 main bana tha, madhubani kaa aar ke college
 Ramakrishna Poorve was a local businessman, because of him and this college is named after him
 shahar ne bhi ramakrishna purve ko bhula diya hoga, ab sabko aar ke college hi yaad rahaa hoga

 aap yakeen nahin karenge ki 15000 chaatro ke liye yahaan maatr 30 professor hai
 a professor will have 500 students
 kya yah mazaaq nahin chal rahaa he
 Can a teacher teach 500 students? The media is running behind the statements of three or four leaders of Delhi and Delhi but are we wondering where the country is running
 30 professor milakar kya 15000 chaatro ko padhaa sakate hai
 How did the people of Madhubani district accept this fate
 yahaan hindi, urdu, bhugol or itihaas main koi shikshak hi nahin he
 Not only this, there are teachers in mathematics, biology and botany
 in vishyon main guest yaa theke par shikshak rakhane kii bhi vyavastha nahin he
 There is no class in the subject for which there are no teachers
 to kya college sirf admician lene bhar kii vyavastha kaa naam he
 Talk to anyone, from the principal to the professor, everyone goes silent
 koi camere par nahin aana chahta he
 Nobody is speaking with fear
 matlab aap yah bataa den ki college bina shikshakon ke chal rahe hai jo karrwai ho sakati he
 The actioner is so sure that even if the teacher is not there, action will not be taken against him
 karrwai kii jagah kya rajya sarkaar ko saare chaatro ko admician fees waapas nahin karnaa chahie
 It is a scam in itself to collect admission fees and do not hire a teacher to teach
 camere par sirf netaa aate hai or panel main unke pravaktaa
 Talking to many people, it is learned that out of 41 colleges, 28-30 colleges have no permanent principal
 prabharee ke badaulat ye saare college chal rahe hai

 11 acre ke campes main yah college 1960 se chal rahaa he
 Its Kabir Bhavan seems to be crying on Kabir itself

 Here 34 posts are approved but 26 posts are vacant
 hindi main to koi professor hi nahin he
 There is only one professor in mathematics
 itihaas polytical science, bhugol, sanskrit main koi professor nahin he
 It is not sure whose students will come to the college to see its face, will there never be a minister in this college, there will not be any MP or MLA program
 yahaan padhane vaale chaatro ke saath kitna bada chal hua, kya unhen kabhi pataa chalaa hoga
 We questioned the secretary of a teachers union that parents would be coming, you are not having education, students would also come
 unka jawaab jaanata tha magar aap shaayad nahin jaanate honge
 Professor Sahab said that no parents come to ask what is happening to their children
 chaatr bhi nahin aate hai, ve bas isi firaaq main rahete hai ki teen saal baad degree to mil jaaegi
 Higher education in Bihar is dismantled
 loktantr main hamaari chetana kaa yah patan vaaki chintajanak he
 Have you thought about how India will become a world guru without a guru, is India being made a world guru by fooling its young students, is it going to throw dust in the eyes of the world or dust in the eyes of the youth of India? Is going to blow lalit narayan mithila vishvavidlaay kii imaarat aap dekh rahe hai
 This University was established in 1972
 chaar zilon ke 69 kalege kaa sanchaalan karata he
 This university started running in the land and building given by Darbhanga Maharaj
 yahaan class na ke baraabar chalati he
 The work of this university remains only the main four
 farm bharna, admician karana, pariksha kaa farm bharaana or riselt prakashit karnaa
 Studying is not its job
 is uniwarsity kaa seshan ek saal let chal rahaa he
 It takes more than four years to get a three-year BA result
 ise manage karne ke liye tarah tarah kaa tarika nikaala jaataa he
 BA first year result is out
 bina padhai ke bachche paas hue
 VC says that soon they will be asked to fill the second year form and the examination will be conducted without studying for the second year
 is tarah se ek saal se peeche chal rahe seshan ko niyamit kar diya jayega
 But students who pass two years, three years without studying, their life will be irregular forever
 in collejon main shikshakon ke pad khaali hai magar guest yaa edock rakhane kii anumati nahin he
 In Delhi University, at least the work of studies continues with the help of adhoc
 vaais chancelar ne bataaya ki i paathshaala shuru karne ja rahe hai taaki shikshak kii kami puri kii ja sake
 Retired professors who are professors will be hired to teach
 magar khaali jagahon par nae pratibhashali naujavaanon ko nahin rakhaa jayega
 Restoration is currently underway in Bihar
 dhimi gati ke samachar kii tarah
 Very few teachers are being appointed out of necessity

 Even after this, Naik has given a grade
 bagair shikshak ke kya kisi college ko e grad mil saktaa he
 Why should we get it
 kya yahi bharat kaa e grad he ki padhaane ke liye teacher nahin he
 Principal of CM Science College said that there is no a grade college even in Patna University

 There is a class here
 isaki prayogshaala or librari kaaphi acchhee he
 Class is closed in college
 nateeja college ke baahar koching centre kii bharmaar ho gai he
 India's education system is running on the strength of these coaching centers

 Look at this board

 On the occasion of Deepawali, the admission of 7000 for the 12th class commerce is getting 1500
 tution ke bhi asi or non asi catagori hai
 Non AC class rooms are cheaper
 ek vishay kii fees 4500 se 6000 hoti he
 There are 7 to 8000 tuition fees for one subject in an AC class room
 in vishvavidhyalayon main kamazor aarthik varg ke chaatr padhate hai
 Governments place two types of burden on them
 pehle unase fees lekar teacher nahin detii hai
 Then go out and force them to pay tuition fees

 kitne logon ne bade armaan se zaminein daan deen, sampatti daan di magar sab rangepute khandhar main badal gaye hai
 Rangepute ruins said because many colleges are shining with development fees and other funds available
 bihar ke begusarai main ladakiyon kaa ek nami college he
 i don't know what the name is for, but ten and a half thousand girls study here
 tippaniyan Sri Krishna Mahila College is a b grade college as per the grading of NAC
 neshnal acridation coucil collejon kii grading karti he
 This b grade college teaches 10,000 girls and it is the only government women's college in Begusarai district
 1958 main is college ko biseshwar prasad singh or sarayu prasad singh ne banwaaya tha
 Donated his land
 sarayu singh vidhayak the or swatantraaa senaanee bhi
 According to which thirty posts of professors are allowed for ten and a half thousand girls, those who have sanctioned the posts must have avenged their failure in mathematics
 phir bhi 30 main se 9 hi professor hai yahaan
 If you divide 9 out of ten and a half thousand, then you will find that a professor is responsible for 1200 children
 kya 1200 ladakiyon ko ek professor padhaa sakati hai
 There are no teachers in Sanskrit, Urdu, Chemistry, Botany
 bihar main ladakiyon kii padhai muft he
 There are no fees for admission
 class main bhi professor nahin hai
 The state government has not given money to the college for two budget sessions
 bijli or internet kaa bill tak nahin diya ja sakaa he
 People are hired on daily basis for computer and other work, but due to lack of funds, the college is unable to keep it either
 ye haal he digital india kaa
 Students are not getting professors, they are getting ruined, those who could have been professors are not getting jobs
 ve bhi barbaad ho rahe hai
 Similarly, 1099 posts have been left in non-teaching
 sarkaron ne bhartiyon band kar di hai
 The building of the college and university seems to be shining but all of them have turned into ruins
 aap in vishyon par kisi netaa ko bolte nahin dekhenge
 How will they tell, then they will have to tell why there are no teachers in these colleges and for how long
 akhir madhunabi, begusarai or darbhanga ke logon ne apane collejon kaa yah patan kaise sweekaar kiya
 Madhubani's RK College was formed in 1940
 sthaneey vyapaaree the, ramakrishna purve, unheen ke kaaran or unheen ke naam par ye college he
 The city must also have forgotten Ramakrishna Poorve, now everyone remembers RK College
 yahaan inter se lekar prost graduate ke 15,000 chaatr padhate hai
 You would not believe that there are only 30 professors for 15,000 students
 ek professor par 500 chaatr aaenge
 Isn't it funny kya ek shikshak 500 chaatro ko padhaa saktaa he? media dilli or dilli ke bhi teen chaar netaaon ke bayanon ke peeche bhaag rahaa he lekin kya ham soch rahe hai ki desh kahaan bhaag rahaa he
 Together 30 professors can teach 15,000 students
 is niyati ko madhubani zile ke logon ne sweekaar bhi kaise kar liya
 There is no teacher in Hindi, Urdu, Geography and History here
 yahi nahin ganit, jeev vigyaan or vanaspati vigyaan main ek ek teacher hai
 In these subjects, there is also no provision for keeping guest or contract teachers
 jis vishay ke shikshak nahin hai vahaan class nahin hoti he
 So is the college just the name of the system of taking admission
 principal se lekar professor kisi se baat kiijie, sab chup ho jate hai
 Nobody wants to come on camera
 ghabara kar koi bol hi nahin rahaa
 Meaning you can tell that colleges are running without teachers, which can be action
 karrwai karne vaale ko itnaa yakeen he ki shikshak bhale na ho magar uske khilaaf karrwai nahin hogi
 Should the state government not refund the admission fees to all the students instead of taking action
 yah apane aap main ghotaalaa he ki admician fees lijie or padhaane ke liye teacher mat rakhie
 Only the leader comes on camera and his spokesperson on the panel
 kai logon se baat kar pataa chalaa he ki 41 collejon main se 28-30 college main koi sthaayee principal nahin he
 All these colleges are running due to the charge
 ye us mithilanchal kaa haal he jahaan se na jane kitne professor, iees se lekar ipies bane honge
 Udaanacharya Rosda College is in Samastipur
 udayanacharya sanskrit ke bade mashhoor vidwaan hue
 This college is named after him
 1960 main ise banane ke liye ram vilaas purve or ram avatar purve ne zamin daan main di thi
 The college has been running since 1960 in an 11-acre campus
 iskaa kabir bhawan lagata he kabir par hi ro rahaa he
 The building will look like everything is fine, but there are only 8 professors to teach 1600 students
 yahaan 34 pad manzur hai lekin 26 pad khaali hai
 There is no professor in Hindi
 ganit main bhi ek hi professor he
 There is no professor in History Political Science, Geography, Sanskrit
 yakeen nahin hota ki yahaan ke chaatr kiskaa cheharaa dekhne college aate honge, kya is college main kabhi koi mantri nahin jate honge, koi saansad yaa vidhayak kaa kaarykram bhi nahin hota hoga
 How big of a deception did the students studying here, have they ever known
 hamane ek shikshak sangh ke sachiv se sawaal kiya ki mata pita to aate honge aap logon ke paas ki padhai nahin ho rahi he, chaatr bhi to aate honge
 He knew their answer but you might not know
 professor sahab ne kaha ki koi mata pita nahin aata he poochne ki unke bacchon ke saath kya ho rahaa he
 The students do not even come, they just live in such a situation that after three years they will get the degree
 bihar main ucch shiksha dhwast he
 This collapse of our consciousness in democracy is really worrying
 kya aapane sochaa he ki bagaiyr guru ke bharat vishwa guru kaise banegaa, kya apane noujvaan chaatro ko bevakoof banaakar bharat ko vishwa guru banaaya ja rahaa he, ye duniya kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne ke liye ho rahaa he yaa bharat ke naujavaanon kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne ke liye ho rahaa he
 You are looking at the building of Lalit Narayan Mithila University
 1972 main yah vishwavidwalay kaayam hua tha
 Operates 69 colleges in four districts
 darbhanga maharaj kii di gai zamin or imaarat main yah vishvavidhyalay chalanaa shuru kiya tha
 Here the class runs at little
 is vishvavidlaay kaa kaam sirf mukhya chaar kaam rah gaye hai
 Filling the form, getting admission, filling the examination form and publishing the result
 padhai iskaa kaam nahin he
 The session of this university is going on for a year
 teen saal ke bie riselt aane main chaar saal se adhik samay lag jaataa he
 There are various ways to manage it
 bie pratham varsh kaa riselt niklaa he
 Children passed without studies
 visi kehete hai ki jaldi hi inhen duusare varsh kaa farm bharne ke liye kaha jayega or duusare saal kii padhai ke bagair pariksha dilaa di jaaegi
 In this way, the session going back by one year will be regularized
 magar jo chaatr do saal teen saal bagair padhe paas honge unka jivan to hameshaa ke liye aniyamit ho jayega
 There are vacancies of teachers in these colleges but no guest or adhoc is allowed
 dilli vishvavidlaay main kam se kam edock ke sahare padhai kaa kaam chalata rahata he
 The Vice Chancellor informed that we are going to start the e-school so that the teacher shortage can be filled
 jo ritaryrd professor hai unhen padhaane ke liye rakhaa jayega
 But new talented youngsters will not be kept in vacant places
 bihar main is samay bahaali chal rahi he
 Like slow motion news
 zarurat se bahut kam shikshakon kii niyukti ho rahi he
 The university has received many teachers due to the recent resumption, but even after this, according to the budget paper of 2018-19, there are 1312 vacancies in Mithilanchal University
 si em science college darbhanga kaa pratishthit college he
 Naik has given it an a grade
 iske baad bhi 50 fisadi pad khaali hai
 There were supposed to be 106 professors, but only 27 professors are teaching here
 79 prophessoron kii kami he is college main
 3000 students study here
 iske baad bhi nack ne e grad diya he
 Can a college get an a grade without a teacher? kyon milanaa chahie
 Is this the a grade of India that there is no teacher to teach? si em science college ke principal ne kaha ki patna uniwarsity main bhi koi e grad college nahin he
 CM is Science College
 yahaan par class hoti he
 Its laboratory and library are quite good
 college main class band he
 The result is a glut of coaching centers outside the college
 bharat kii shiksha vyavastha inhen koching centre ke bharose chal rahi he
 Which do not come under any Human Resource Development Minister nor any University Grant Commission
 is board ko aap dekhie
 Deepavali's bumper blast is for tuition
 deepawali ke avasar par barahavin class ke commers ke liye 7000 kaa admician 1500 main mil rahaa he
 Tution also has AC and non-ac categories
 non asi class room sasta hota he
 The fees for a subject range from 4500 to 6000
 asi class room main ek vishay ke liye 7 se 8000 tution fees he
 Students from weaker economic classes attend these universities
 un par sarkarein do prakaar kaa boj daalati hai
 First, the teacher does not pay the fees from them
 phir baahar jaakar tution fees dene ke liye majaboor karti hai
 At a glance, the education government of India is running, but look closely, the poor parents are carrying the burden of India's education system
 badale main unhen shiksha kii jagah bacchon kii barbaadi mil rahi he
 This has been happening for twenty years
 gaanv gaanv kasbon kasbon main bane collejon ko samaapt kar diya gaya he
 How many people donated land with great pride, donated property but all have turned into colorful ruins
 rangepute khandhar isliye kaha kyonki deveopment fees or milane vaale anya fund se bahut se college chamakate nazar aate hai
 There is a renowned girls' college in Begusarai, Bihar
 nami kis liye he pataa nahin magar yahaan saadhe das hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai
 The comments shri krishna mahila college nack kii grading ke anusaar bi grad college he
 The National Accreditation Council does grading of colleges
 is bi grad college main saadhe das hazaar ladkiyaan padhati hai or begusarai zile kaa yah ek maatr sarkari mahila college he
 In 1958, this college was built by Biseshwar Prasad Singh and Saryu Prasad Singh
 apni zamin daan main di
 Saryu Singh was an MLA and also a freedom fighter
 kis hisaab se saadhe das hazaar chaatraon ke liye profasaron ke tees pad manzur hai, pad manzur karne vaale ne zarur ganit main fail hone kaa badla liya hoga
 Yet only 9 out of 30 professors are here
 jahaan saadhe das hazaar main 9 se bhaag kiijie to pataa chalegaa ki ek professor par 1200 bacchon kii zimmedaari he
 Can a professor teach 1200 girls? sanskrit, urdu, chemistry, botni main shikshak nahin hai
 Girls are free to study in Bihar
 admician ke liye koi fees nahin lagati he
 There are no professors in the class either
 rajya sarkaar ne do bajet satr se college ko paisa nahin diya he
 Electricity and Internet bills have not been given
 computer or anya kaam ke liye dihadi par log rakhe jate hai magar fund ke abhaav main college wo bhi nahin rakh paa rahaa he
 This is the condition of Digital India
 1940 main bana tha, madhubani kaa aar ke college
 Ramakrishna Poorve was a local businessman, because of him and this college is named after him
 shahar ne bhi ramakrishna purve ko bhula diya hoga, ab sabko aar ke college hi yaad rahaa hoga
 It has 15,000 students from Inter to Prost Graduates
 aap yakeen nahin karenge ki 15000 chaatro ke liye yahaan maatr 30 professor hai
 a professor will have 500 students
 kya yah mazaaq nahin chal rahaa he
 Can a teacher teach 500 students? The media is running behind the statements of three or four leaders of Delhi and Delhi but are we wondering where the country is running
 30 professor milakar kya 15000 chaatro ko padhaa sakate hai
 How did the people of Madhubani district accept this fate
 yahaan hindi, urdu, bhugol or itihaas main koi shikshak hi nahin he
 Not only this, there are teachers in mathematics, biology and botany
 in vishyon main guest yaa theke par shikshak rakhane kii bhi vyavastha nahin he
 There is no class in the subject for which there are no teachers
 to kya college sirf admician lene bhar kii vyavastha kaa naam he
 Talk to anyone, from the principal to the professor, everyone goes silent
 koi camere par nahin aana chahta he
 Nobody is speaking with fear
 matlab aap yah bataa den ki college bina shikshakon ke chal rahe hai jo karrwai ho sakati he
 The actioner is so sure that even if the teacher is not there, action will not be taken against him
 karrwai kii jagah kya rajya sarkaar ko saare chaatro ko admician fees waapas nahin karnaa chahie
 It is a scam in itself to collect admission fees and do not hire a teacher to teach
 camere par sirf netaa aate hai or panel main unke pravaktaa
 Talking to many people, it is learned that out of 41 colleges, 28-30 colleges have no permanent principal
 prabharee ke badaulat ye saare college chal rahe hai
 This is the situation in Mithilanchal, from where no one knows how many professors, from IAS to IPS
 samastipur main udayanacharya rosda college he
 Udayanacharya became a very famous scholar of Sanskrit
 unheen ke naam par yah college he
 It was donated by Ram Vilas Purve and Ram Avatar Purve in 1960 to build it
 11 acre ke campes main yah college 1960 se chal rahaa he
 Its Kabir Bhavan seems to be crying on Kabir itself
 imaarat dekhakar lagegaa ki sab thik hi he magar yahaan ke 1600 chaatro ko padhaane ke liye maatr 8 professor hai
 Here 34 posts are approved but 26 posts are vacant
 hindi main to koi professor hi nahin he
 There is only one professor in mathematics
 itihaas polytical science, bhugol, sanskrit main koi professor nahin he
 It is not sure whose students will come to the college to see its face, will there never be a minister in this college, there will not be any MP or MLA program
 yahaan padhane vaale chaatro ke saath kitna bada chal hua, kya unhen kabhi pataa chalaa hoga
 We questioned the secretary of a teachers union that parents would be coming, you are not having education, students would also come
 unka jawaab jaanata tha magar aap shaayad nahin jaanate honge
 Professor Sahab said that no parents come to ask what is happening to their children
 chaatr bhi nahin aate hai, ve bas isi firaaq main rahete hai ki teen saal baad degree to mil jaaegi
 Higher education in Bihar is dismantled

 But students who pass two years, three years without studying, their life will be irregular forever

 According to which thirty posts of professors are allowed for ten and a half thousand girls, those who have sanctioned the posts must have avenged their failure in mathematics
 phir bhi 30 main se 9 hi professor hai yahaan
 If you divide 9 out of ten and a half thousand, then you will find that a professor is responsible for 1200 children

 Not only this, the party contested elections on its own in the state

 It tries to control the BJP
 netaaon ne maang kii he ki shivasena kii in harkaton ko ab bardaasht karne kii jarurat nahin he
 The party has accused the Shiv Sena that the credit for the tremendous success achieved in the Lok Sabha elections was not given to Narendra Modi
 bijepi ke sthaneey netaaon ne shivasena netaaon par unhen apamaanit karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 Angry over the Shiv Sena at the internal meeting, several Maharashtra BJP officials, enthused by the spectacular performance in the Lok Sabha elections, said that the party should not give any less importance to the alliance partner Shiv Sena in the assembly elections due by the end of this year
 maharashtra bhaajapa pramukh devendra fadanvis ne mumbai main hui ek baithak main party kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki shivasena kii shikayaton kaa ek upyukt manch par samaadhaan kiya jayega
 He said, 'shiv Sena has been our partner in difficult times as well as difficult times
 keval isliye ki hamaari party ne loksabhaa chunaav main acha pradarshan kiya he, gathbandhan todane kaa aahvaan karnaa thik nahin hoga
 He said this in response to the speeches of some leaders who said that the Shiv Sena did not allow the BJP to grow in the state during the last 25 years
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa madhu chavaan ne kaha, ‘shivasena (paaramparik rup se) 174 siton par or bhaajapa maatr 114 siton par (vidhansabha chunaav main) ummidavaar utaarti he
 This gap is huge and our party should get an equal share
 ’ kuch vaktaa chaahate the ki party gathbandhan tod de

 In the event of landing five specialist bowlers, Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane are yet to be decided as to which to choose
 do test maichon kii siries kaa pehla test 22 se 26 agast tak sar vivian richards stadium (north sound, antiga) main khelaa jayega
 This will be the first match for the two teams under the World Test Championship
 team india agar chaar gendbaajon ke saath utarane kii ranneeti par chalati he to rohit or rahane donon ko antim ekadash main jagah mil sakati he
 If this does not happen, then either of these two will have to sit out and looking at the current form Rahane is finding it difficult to choose
 bharat saadhe saat maheene ke baad lambii avadhi ke praaroop main khilne ke liye utrega or antim ekadash ko lekar sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki viraat kohli or ravi shastri guuruuvaar se shuru hone vaale pehle test match ke liye atirikt chathe ballebaaj yaa atirikt gendbaaj ke saath utarate hai yaa nahin
 If the Indian team management follows the traditional strategy, KL Rahul and Mayank Agarwal should start the innings, but it should not be forgotten that Rahul was not selected in the team for the last two Tests against Australia and Hanuma Vihari innings
 Was introduced
 IND vs WI: sirf ek jeet
 
 
 And although Captain Kohli will make Dhoni's match, he did not score much runs, but he played a key role in shining the ball, which benefited Aggarwal and Cheteshwar Pujara
 agar rahul ke pichley saal ke kharaab test record ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he to vihari phir se pari kaa aagaaj kar sakate hai
 Pujara and Kohli are two strong pillars at number three and four, but the problem starts after that
 wicketiper ballebaaj rishabh pant chathe number par utar sakate hai or hardik pandya kii gaurmaujuudagi main rabindra jadeja team ko santulan dene ke liye saatven number par aa sakate hai
 In such a situation, Kohli will have to choose between Rohit and Rahane
 rohit ne apni antim test pari main naabad ardhashatak jamaaya tha or abhyaas match kii pehali pari main bhi unhone acchhee ballebaaji kii
 Rahane scored in the second innings, but he is not in good form and even while playing in county cricket for Hampshire, his confidence did not grow
 in donon ko chaar gendbaajon ke saath utarane kii ranneeti par hi ekadash main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, three fast bowlers Jaspreet Bumrah, Mohammad Shami and Ishant Sharma and the only spinner in the form of Ravichandran Ashwin or Kuldeep Yadav will be retained in the team
 atirikt ballebaaj utaarne kaa matlab jadeja ko mauka nahin mil paaegaa
 Captain Kohli has always been in favor of taking five bowlers, as it takes 20 wickets to win a Test match
 agar pich tej gendbaajon ke liye anukool ho to umesh yadav ko bhi team main liya ja saktaa he
 a special branch of geology in which earthquakes are studied is called seismology
 bukamp ke teen tarah ke kampan hote hai
 (1) Primary wave: This wave passes through every medium in the earth
 iskaa ausat veg 8 kimi prati second hota he
 This speed is greater than all waves
 jisase ye tarange kisi bhi sthaan par sabase pehle pahunchati hai
 (2) Second wave: They are also called transverse waves
 yah tarang keval thos madhyam se hokar guzarati he
 Its average velocity is 4 km per second
 (3) el-tarange:inhen dharatleey yaa lambii tarango ke naam se bhi pukaara jaataa he
 The discovery of these waves D
 Love did it
 inhen kai baar Love waves ke naam se bhi pukaara jaataa he
 Their other name is R-waves
 ye tarange dharaatal tak hi simit rahati hai
 These solids, liquids and gases can pass through all three mediums
 iskaa veg 1
 Is 5–3 km per second
 bhukampi tarangon ko seismograph (seismograph) naamak yantra dwaara rekhaankit kiya jaataa he
 This leads to the following facts in their behavior: (a) The velocity of all seismic waves increases when passing through high density materials and decreases when passing through low density materials
 (b)keval praathmik tarange hi prithvi ke kendriya bhaag se guzar sakati hai lekin vahaan par unka veg kam ho jaataa he
 (c) Secondary waves cannot pass through liquid matter
 (d)el-tarangen keval dharaatal ke paas hi chalati hai
 (e) These waves are reflected and refracted while passing through various mediums
 bukamp kaa cendrabukamp ke udbhav sthaan ko uskaa centre kehete hai
 Three types of waves P, s and l reach near the epicenter of the earthquake
 prithvi ke bhitari bhaagon main ye tarange apana maarg badalakar bheetar kii ore avatal maarg par yatra karti hai
 p and s waves reach a distance of 11000 km along the surface from the earthquake center
 kendriya bhaag par pahunchane par s tarange lupt ho jaati hai or p tarange apavartit ho jaati hai
 Because of this no wave reaches about 5000 km after 11000 km from the epicenter of the earthquake
 is kshetra ko chaaya kshetra (shadow Zone) kaha jaataa he
 Earthquake Epicentre The point on the surface of the earth just above the center of the earthquake is called the earthquake epicenter
 jin samvedansheel yantron se bukampiy tarangon kii tivrata maapi jaati he unhe bukampalekhi yaa seismograph (seismograph) kehete hai
 It has three scales :( i) Rossiferral scale (ii) Merkeli scale (iii) Richter Scale The Richter scale measuring earthquake intensity was developed by American scientist Charles Richter in 1935
 richter scale par prayek agali ikai pichhali ikai kii tulana main 10 guna adhik tivrata rakhti he
 2 on this scale
 0 yaa 3
 An earthquake of magnitude 0 is mild, while 6

 For this reason, work has not started on the sewage treatment plant yet
 dilli jal bordake chairman khud dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal hai
 The NGT was enraged at the statement of the CEO of the Jal Board and said that the work to be completed in 2019
 use abhi tak shuru bhi nahin kiya gaya
 The court asked why the Delhi Jal Board and Delhi Government bank accounts should be confiscated
 engiti ne dilli sarkaar or jal board ko contempt kaa kaaran bataao notice thama diya or 10 ke andar jawaab daakhil karne ko kaha he
 If 14 sewage treatment plants are commissioned at the right time, then 67% pollution of Yamuna will be reduced

 In the first phase, 14 sewage treatment plans were to be put in place and completed by 2019

 pedo par hai machhliyalekhakaspratibha chouhanaprakashkabodhi prakaashan, jaipurkimtah125 ru
 Poetry collection with deep feelings towards the country, society, language, its poetic collections are already on the trees, the maturity introduced by Pratibha Chauhan in fish is very rare
 idhar kii hindi kavita main do ativaadee pravritiyaan dekhne ko mil rahi hai
 On the one hand, poetry is being made almost incomprehensible, on the other hand, there is a gross expression of reality in the name of poetry
 pratibha ne in do ativaadon ke bich se apana kavy maarg banaaya he
 His rare feature is to express reality in an artistic way without compromising on communicability
 striyon kii shuruaati kavitaaon main praayah nijee anubhavon kii bahulata hoti he
 For this reason, the subject matter of his poems is very limited and becomes monogamous
 pratibha ke yahaan vishaygat vistaar bahut he
 In her poems, the country, society, nation, environment, displacement, language, etc
 are more concerned about the personal feeling of woman
 yah vishistataa hi unki asal takat he
 In the pain of displacement, where they express the pain and frustration of the displaced man, there was a passion to share the unilateral relationship between man and nature - and to take it into man
 is sangrah main kuch acchhee prem kavitaayen bhi hai
 In these poems, the sense of dedication is more pronounced
 kai jagah to apane astitv ko mitaa dene kii udaattata he
 In spite of this, there is a touch of intellectualism rather than sentimentality in poems
 bimb or pratikon kaa behtareen istemaal he
 Roop Paksha with Bhavapaksha is equally beautiful

 yahaan jaanwaron ko god le sakate hai

 jaanwaron ke rakh-rakhaav par hone vaale kharch kaa boj kam karne ke liye ju management ne logon ko yah aakarshak ofer diya he
 The Zoo management wants to add Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to the campaign after Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra to make people aware of it
 pichley do saal se isaki koshish ho rahi he, lekin abhi tak safalataa nahin mili he
 But Zoo Management feels that this time Dhoni will come forward for the animals and adopt them
 ju diarector eke paatra ke mutabik, ju main jaanwaron ke dekh-rekh main hone walakhrch bahut adhik he
 So we have started the scheme that people can adopt animals
 iske liye ham kuch badi celibrity ko jodne kii yojana par bhi kaam kar rahe hai
 In the last year, Priyanka Chopra adopted two lionesses named Sundari and Durga
 unki maa apane rishtedaaron ke saath kai baar yahaan aa chuki hai
 The spectators of the Jharkhand government coming to visit this campaign are also very happy
 unka kahana he ki sarkaar kii is pahal se ek taraf jaanwaron kaa bhala hoga, to vahiin aam aadmi ko pehali baar sidhe taur par jaanwaron ke liye kuch karne kaa mauka milegaa

 vijender ne kaha, ‘number ek mukkebaaz hone se championships main koi dabaav nahin hoga
 The boxing championship is being held in India after many years and all Indian boxers will be encouraged by the domestic audience
 ’ padak kii sambhaavnaaon ke bare main unhone kaha, ‘mujhe ummid he ki main darshakon or apane deshavaasiyon kii ummiido par khara utarkar swarna padak hasil karuunga
 Regarding the challenge faced by boxers from 18 countries in the championship, Vijender said, "never should your opponent be considered weak, or over-confidence can prove dangerous
" isaliye main ek ek bout par apana dhyaan lagaaungaa
 He and other boxers had expressed a desire to practice before the start of the championship at the Talkatora Stadium and said that it would give them some leverage
 lekin ab mukkebaaji dal ravivaar tak dilli pahonchega
 The Bhiwani boxer, who has recently recovered from the injury, said, 'it would have been better if we had got the stadium earlier
 ham stadium main ring par thodaa abhyaas kar lete to hamen ring kaa ahsaas ho jaataa
 But our main goal is the Commonwealth Games and before that this championship will give us a great platform
 ’ vijender ne bharat ke 10 sadasyeey dal se padak kii ummiido ke bare main puche jane par kaha, ‘ham sabhi yahaan acha abhyaas kar rahe hai or sabhi kii taiyaariyaan kaaphi acchhee hai
 It is difficult to say about the medal because in which direction the bout goes, nothing can be said

 On the first day of the Gujarat tour, Raj Thackeray spoke Hindi and in Maharashtra political mercury rose
 raaj thakare par danaadan hamale hue
 MNS chief Raj Thackeray reached Gujarat as Narendra Modi's official guest and the tongue changed
 dekhen gujarat daure par raaj thakare ne kya kahtaksar marathi bolne vaale firebrands netaa modi ke pradesh main hindi bolne lage or hindi main hi un logon par nishaanaa saadh liya jo unke daure par siyasat karne kii firaaq main hai
 Raj Thackeray said, 'it is not political to see the development of a state, the thinking of those who think so is quite small
 lekin raaj thakare ke gujarat daure ne to bhuuchaal khadaa nahin kiya alabatta gujarat main hindi bolne par maharashtra kii siyasat main sawaal khadey kiye jane lage
 There was a ruckus in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and Shiv Sena got a chance to assert a monopoly on the Marathi issue
 raaj kii hindi jubaan par congress ne bhi jhatpat chutki lee
 On hearing Raj Thackeray's Hindi, Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi remembered the day when Raj Thackeray mlas created a ruckus when the Samajwadi mlas took oath in Hindi
 lihaaja abu azmi ne bhi fouran hamalaa bolaa
 When the news of political attacks reached Raj Thackeray, he retaliated in Marathi

 Therefore, with the help of this act, the people of Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Parsi, Jain and Buddhism who came from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh will be given citizenship of India
 lekin is act main islam dharm ke logon ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 After the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Bill, now Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and those who entered India by 31 December 2014
 ve sabhi bharat kii naagarikta ke liye aavedan kar sakenge
 Opponents of this law say that it only talks about granting citizenship to non-muslim people, hence it is a religious discrimination law which is in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution
 CAA par supreme court main kya hua (supreme Court on caa)naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon, 2019 kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata ko chunauti dene vaali sabhi 59 yachikaaon par court ne sangyaan liya

 They will all be eligible for citizenship of India
 Has CAB Become a law?cab yani Citizenship Amendment Bill sansad main paas hokar raashtrapati kii muhar lagane ke baad ab kanoon ban gaya he
 Why does the Act leave Muslims out? Home Minister Amit Shah says that Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh are Muslim countries
 vahaan dharm ke naam par muslim utpeedit nahin hote, isliye unhen is act main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 What is the date of cut-off? -the cut-off date for citizenship has been kept on 31 December 2014
 -CAA se koun log baahar hai?-is kanoon se assam ke adivasee ilaake or meghalaya, mizoram yaa tripura ke alaava arunachal pradesh, mizoram va nagaland ko baahar rakhaa gaya he
 - Does India have repatriation treaties with Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan? - Repatriation is the process of sending someone back or sending someone back to their place of origin
 ek baar jab sarkaar avaidh pravaasiyon (adhinium ke anusaar) kii rashtriyata nirdhaarit karti he, to adarsh rup se unhen apane mul desh waapas bheja janaa chahie
 However, India has no such treaty with Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan
 -naagarikta kanoon, 1955 ke anusaar avaidh pravasi koun hai?-vaid passport yaa yatra dastavejon ke bina bharat main pravesh karne vaale log yaa vaid dastavejon ke saath pravesh karne vaale wo log jo sweekrut avadhi ke baad bhi waapas nahin gaye hai, ve sabhi avaidh pravasi hai

 unke alaava vaid passport yaa yatra dastavejon ke bina bharat main pravesh karne vaale log yaa vaid dastavejon ke saath pravesh karne vaale wo log jo sweekrut avadhi ke baad bhi waapas nahin gaye hai, ve sabhi avaidh pravasi hai
 - Why is there a protest against this law? - Opponents say that this law is against the basic spirit and secularism of the Constitution
 is kanoon main desh main rah rahe avaidh pravaasiyon ko dharmik aadhaar par baanta ja rahaa he
 It talks about giving citizenship to people of six religions living in the country illegally as refugees, but calls such Muslims as intruders
 is kanoon ko enarasi kii taiyaari bhi bataaya ja rahaa he
 In future, only Muslims will have to prove their citizenship by bringing NRC, while the other six religions will get exemption from this
 ve muslim jo bharat kii naagarikta sabit nahin kar paaenge unhen assam kii tarj par ditension centre main rakhaa jayega

 aankadon ke mutabik saal kii shuruyaat se ab takkashmiramen 164 sthaneey yuvakon neatankwadaka rasta akhriyaar kiya, 180 se zyada aatanki maare gaye or takreeban 350-400 aatanki ghati main sakriy hai
 The period of violence that followed the elimination of Burhan Wani The encounter, bandh and violence was confined to South Kashmir only after Hizbul commander Burhan Wani was killed in 2016
 haalanki haal main uttar kashmir main aatanki mannaan vaani ke maare jane or sthaneey str par aatankiyon kii badhati bhartee se aisa prathit hota he ki dakshin kashmir ke baad ab aatankwaad ne uttar kashmir ko bhi apane chapet main le liya he
 Actually before July 2016, South Kashmir was considered quieter than North Kashmir
 jabaki uttar kashmir niyantran rekha paar kar aae seemaa paar ke aatankiyon kaa garh mana jaataa tha, jo bandipora, baraamula or kupwada ke jangalon main sharan lete the
 After the death of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani, the entire Kashmir protest went on for 6 months
 haalanki suraksha balon ne sthiti par niyantran paane main safalataa bhi hasil kii, lekin sthaneey str par dakshin kashmir ke anantnag, kulgaam, shopiyaan or pulavama jile se yuvaaon kii aatankwaadi sanghathanon main bhartee main badhotaree hui
 Meanwhile, most of the terrorists killed in encounters with security forces in North Kashmir came from across the border, while those killed in South Kashmir were locals
 dakshin main burhan or uttar main mannaan bana cheharadakshin kashmir ke pulavama jile ke traal kshetra kaa rahane vaala burhan vaani ek samay main ghati main aatank kaa cheharaa ban gaya tha
 Mannan Wani, a resident of Kupwara district of North Kashmir, who was a phd student at Aligarh Muslim University and his photo with AK-47 went viral on 7 January 2018, a day after hizb-ul-mujahideen confirmed that Mannan Has joined Hizbul
 isse saaf ho gaya ki ab tak sthaneey aatankwaad se achoote uttar kashmir main sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa he
 According to security sources on the terrorist Mannan Wani, who was killed in Handwara area of kupwara district on October 10, Mannan was active in the districts of South Kashmir for the last 9 months and was sent to recruit local youths in North Kashmir
 lekin isse pehle ki wo or yuvakon ko hathiyaar uthaane ke liye bahakaata, apane ek saathi ke saath maar giraaya gaya
 According to sources in the mass recruitment of local youths, most of the terrorists active in North Kashmir are Pakistanis, while in South Kashmir, local terrorists are active

 Their leaders sitting across the border believe that to gain local support and sympathy, they will have to gain a foothold in the localities, especially in North Kashmir
 sutron ke mutabik kashmir ghati main abhi 350-400 aatanki sakriy hai or janvari se ab tak ghati ke 164 yuvakon ne aatankwaad kaa rasta akhriyaar kiya he
 This number has increased over the years
 saal 2015 main 66 kashmiri yuvak or 2016 main 88 kashmiri yuvak aatankwaadi sanghathanon main shaamil hue the, jabaki 2017 main yah sankhya badhkar 120 ho gai
 And since January this year, the number has reached 180
 akele oktober ke maheene main surakshabalon ne hijbul or lashkar ke 17 aatankiyon ko maar giraaya he
 150 militants were killed in Kashmir in 2016 and 213 in 2017
 aankadon ke mutabik 2016 main uttar kashmir main 18 muthbhedon main 28 aatanki maare gaye or 2017 main 24 muthbhedon main 32 aatankiyon kaa safaya hua
 But in 2018, 40 terrorists were killed in 31 encounters in North Kashmir
 vahiin uttar kashmir ke ilaake main aatankiyon kii ghuspaith karaane ke liye44 baar seemaa paar se sangharsh viraam ulanghan hua
 According to sources, about 100 terrorists are active in North Kashmir, including 16 locals
 surakshabalon ke liye dohari chunautidakshin kashmir main aatanki soshal media ke jariye police javaanon, sena ke khabari, mukhyadhara ke netaaon ko dhamka rahe hai
 In view of this, the administration also stopped mobile, internet services in this area many times
 haal hi main uttar kashmir ke kupwada or baraamula jilon se kuch video viral hue jisamen lashkar-e-taiyaba se sambandhit sthaneey aatanki rajya main hone vaale panchayat chunaav ke ummidavaaron or sthaneey netaaon ko dhamkaate hue paae gaye ki yadi unhone raajnneeti nahin chodi to iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa
 On condition of anonymity, a senior officer of the Jammu and Kashmir Police said that the number of terrorists in North Kashmir is not less than in South Kashmir
 jis tarah se dakshin kashmir main aatanki saarvajanik sabhaaon, masjidon or bazaaron main dekhe jate the usee tarah ab uttar kashmir main bhi sthaneey yuvakon ne muthbhed sthalon par surakshabalon se morcha lenaa or encounter ke dauraan baadha daalana shuru kar diya he
 Therefore, in this area too, like South Kashmir, it is facing difficulty in maintaining law and order
 uttar kashmir main let bana rahaa besayk taraf surakshabalon ke kanoon vyavastha kaayam rakhane main mushkile aa rahi hai, to duusari taraf unke saamne seemaa paar se ghuspaith kar aae aatankiyon kaa shaharon or kasbon main pahunchane se pehle safaya karnaa bhi ek chunauti he
 Earlier the security apparatus of the valley was satisfied, it has kept terrorism in South Kashmir, while in North Kashmir the strategy was focused on cross-border infiltration
 lekin ab surakshabalon ke liye chunauti yah he ki lashkar se jude aatanki uttar kashmir ke bandipora or kupwada jile main apana base bana rahe hai

 party ne saath hi sarkaar par kaig kii aalochana karne ke bhaajapa dwaara lagaaye gayi aaropon ko bhi haasyaaspad bataaya
 Union Minister Kapil Sibal said that there is no question of any benefit from the allocation of coal blocks as there is no sale of coal
 unhone bhaajapa par palatwaar karte hue aarope lagaaya ki mukhya vipakshi dal desh ke bare main nahin sochati or 2014 se pehle kisi tarah satta main aana chaahati he
 He wanted to know from the main opposition party whether all the decisions made for allocation of coal from 1998 to 2004 should be canceled and thousands of crores should be lost
 unhone kaha, ‘yah koi saamaanya mudda nahin he yah desh ke bhavishya se judaa jatil aarthik mudda he
 They should understand its consequences
 ’sibbal ne kaha, ‘aap puure aarthik dhaanche ko nasht nahin kar sakate
 Do they know the consequences of what the opposition is saying? agar bijli or steel kaarkaane ko koyala nahin milegaa to unhen koyala aayaat karnaa hoga or aaayaatit koyale kii keemat teen guna zyada he
 This will make electricity and steel costlier and eventually lead to inflation

 She only believes in the principle of obstruction

 Sibal also denied the charge of the main opposition party that the Congress attacks constitutional bodies
 unhone kaha ki aisa kabhi koi mauka nahin hua jab kisi ne koi apshabd kaha ho
 Yes, we have disagreed on the cag's findings

 He said in a challenging tone that we have never used words like BJP used words against CAG
 unhone kaha ki rajg ke kaarykaal ke dauraan jo hua vah sab thik tha
 Everything was transparent
 hamane jo kiya vah sab galat
 He accused the BJP of doing something and saying something else
 unhone kaig kii tarah pradhanmantri ko bhi ek sanvaidhanik sanstha bataaya or kaha ki agar kaig sanvaidhanik sanstha he to pradhanmantri bhi sanvaidhanik sanstha hai
 On a clean swim, he said, 'we do not agree with the CAG report

 Because the news ends like this
 dhire-dhire or phir ek din achaanak se
 Let the second news begin
 dilli main ek aisa kaal centre pakadaa gaya he jo hamaare samaaj kii bheetar kii parat ko khol detaa he
 You see how this society, acting from top to daughter, keeps creating a situation of not wanting and killing daughters from within
 ek kaal centre ke zarie bada network pakadaa gaya he jiskaa kaam tha un dampattiyon ko singapore bhejnaa, dubai bhejnaa yaa thailand bhejnaa jo bete kii chaah main in vitro fertilideeshan centre jate hai
 The network came to know this week when The National Inspection and Monitoring Committee (NIMC) raided a clinic in Kirtinagar, South Delhi
 kirtinagar main ek ivief centre main jab chapa padaa tab vahaan se is kaal centre ke bare main pataa chalaa jise iaiti se paas karne vaale ejeeniyar ne start ap ke taur par chalaaya tha
 This call center was running for two years
 karolbaag ke ek hotel korea plaza main yah kaal centre kaam kar rahaa tha jahaan par somvaar ko chapa padaa tha
 The call center has been sealed and 300 laptops have been seized from here
 yahaan par kareeb 300 log kaam karte the
 The raiding agency visited the center in Kirtinagar because it suspected that there was a gender test
 vahaan se pataa chalaa ki ek kaal centre chal rahaa he
 With which 100 in vitro fertilization centers across the country are connected
 aap jaanate hai ki bharat main garbh dhaaran se sambandhit ek sakht kanoon he
 Neither before nor after gender testing can be done
 aisa karne vaale pati patni or sahyog dene vaale doctoron ko jail kii sazaa hoti he
 Punishment is three years
 kisi kisi maamle main 5 saal kii jail he
 This would have been big news in any country of the world, but who is talking about the National Register of Citizens at Ramlila in Delhi, it is discussed
 to Pre Conception, Pre Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PC-PNDT) Act ke hote hue bhi dilli shahar main ek kaal centre chal rahaa tha
 We are taking this news so lightly that it has been four days of raids but this website has not been blocked
 elawumin naam kii is website par daawa kiya he ki isane do saal ke bheetar ek karod se adhik marizon kii seva di he
 One lakh doctors and clinics are associated with it
 61000 se bachche paidaa hue hai or 30 lakh se adhik apointment doctoron ke saath karaae hai
 The call center was represented in IVF
 jaanch karne vaali sanstha The National Inspection and Monitoring Committee (NIMC) kaa daawa he ki 6 lakh mahilaon ne is kaal centre se sampark kiya tha
 
 jab NIMC ke afasar is kaal centre main gaye to unhen bataaya gaya ki 100 fisadi betaa paidaa hone kii sau pratishat guarantee vaali prakriya kya he
 The address of this website is given in the official press release
 bahut zaruri he ki un mata pita ko pakadaa jaae jinhone dubai singapore or thailand jaakar ling pareekshan kaa kaam kiya he
 Rather, these parents of New India should surrender themselves and name their doctors
 wo kanoon se batch jaaenge lekin us tempo se nahin batch paaenge jo unki gaadi ke aage ja rahaa hoga or us par likhaa hoga beti bachaao, beti padhaao
 The condition is that the (PC-PNDT) Act was enacted in 1996, but Delhi's program officer Nitin Kumar has published a statement in the media that such an action has been taken against an IVF clinic for the first time in Delhi
 aakhir log rasta khoj rahe hai ki kaise dubai, singapore or thailand ke kanoonon kaa phayda uthaakar ladkaa paidaa kiya jaae or ladki paidaa hone se roka jaae
 How many couples who had contact with this call center had a son and some a daughter, until it is investigated, nothing can be said concretely
 isliye is kshetra main kaam karne vaali sanstha girls count kii maang he ki ek ek mariz kaa detail jaanch hona chahie
 Registered for just Rs 10,000
 saadhe aath lakh kaa package kharidie or dubai jaakar betaa paidaa kiijie
 a report from The National, a Abu Dhabi-run news site, also states that the sex-testing business is flourishing before conception in Dubai

 pichley paanch saal main betaa paidaa karne kii maang karne waalon kii sankhya dabl ho gai he
 a doctor has said that most of the parents who want a son are from India
 jab tak ek ek mariz kaa ricard nahin dekha jayega or tab tak pataa nahin chalegaa ki kitnon ne betaa ke liye sampark kiya he
 India is not allowed to kill daughters in the womb, so this work is being done by going to foreign countries
 saaf shabdon main yahi baat he
 That is why our society gets silent on such news because many people start raising expectations on how they will get a chance of seeing such news
 yah bhi ek sachai he
 An FIR has been registered against this company
 kya kabhi is khel main shaamil doctor pakade jaaenge, mushkil lagata he
 One can only hope to be caught

 2 saal pehle rajesh thakkar naamak ek shaks ne ravi group ke liye shilpa shetty or raaj kundra ke flats kaa sauda karavaaya
 When Ravi Group liked this flat for the first time, it gave Amount Raj Kundra Rs 1 crore as a token
 samay par raaj kundra ko paisa nahin mila, isliye raaj kundra ne deal cancil kar rajesh thakkar ko 1 karod rupee waapas kar die
 But seeing the crores of rupees, the intention of the broker was tempered and he took all the money and fled to America with the family

 ) pehle NSA str kii vaarta kaa tut janaa or ab sabakuch kashmir mudde par aakar thahar janaa
 Then the defense minister of Pakistan said that if India imposes war on us, then it may have to suffer heavy losses
 ab sena pramukh general dalbir singh kaa ye kahana kipakistan kii badali hui ranneetike maddenjar hamaari senaaon ko nikat bhavishya memchoti ladaaiyon ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 Can it be interpreted in such a way that India and Pakistan are moving towards the fifth war
 haalanki, isse pehle 1948, 1965, 1971 or 1999 ke kargil yuddh main pakistan ko haar kaa munh hi dekhnaa padaa he
 But then the same situation is being created now
 aaie is puure maamle ko samajhane kii koshish karte hai 10 sanketon ke saath
 
 
 1
 NSA vaarta radd honarus ke upha main pradhanmantri narendra modi or unke pakistani samakaksh navaj sharif ke bichvaarta bahaali kii jo sahmatibani thi
 It was then decided that there would be NSA level talks on 23 August
 lekin pakistan kii ore se kashmiri algaavvaadiyon ko nimantran bheje jane ke masale ne tool pakad liya or donon deshon kii vaarta radd ho gai
 2
 sabakuch kashmir par aakar thahar janaunsha vaarta talane kaa sabase syah paksh ye rahaa ki bharat or pakistan ke bich sabakushkashmir ke mudde par aakar thahar sa gayalagta he
 When Pakistan refused to withdraw the invitation to Kashmiri separatists, India made it clear that except Kashmir, it would only talk on the issue of terrorism
 yahaan se aage kii raah mushkil lagati he kyonki donon deshon ne kashmir par apni-apni simaaen tay kar lee he
 3
 pakistani raksha mantri or suraksha salaahkaar kii dhamkionsha vaarta tuutane ke baad pakistan kii ore se lagaataar dhamkee bhare bayaan saamne aae
 It seems clear that after the talks break down, Pakistan is afraid of action to destroy terrorist camps from India
 pehle pakistan ke suraksha salaahkaar sartaaj ajij nebharat ko dhamkee diphir vahaan ke raksha mantri ne dhamkee di ki agar bharat ham par yuddh thopata he to use baari nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 4
 golibari par rajnath singh kaa sakht bayanhensha vaarta main bharat kii ore se aatankwaad ke saath-saath baar-baar ho rahe sijafire ulanghan kaa maamla bhi uthaaya jane vaala tha lekin vaarta tuutane ke baad ab bharat ke paas seemapar se firing kaa jawaab firing se dena hi ekmaatr vikalp rah gaya he
 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh gave a clear message to the security forces posted on the border that first do not shoot, but if there is a bullet from the side, then do not count the bullets
 ye bayaan bhi donon deshon ke bichtalkh hote rishton kobyaan karata he
 5
 sena pramukh kaa taaja bayanpakistan kii ore se lagaataar dhamkiyon ke bich mangalvaar ko sena pramukh general dalbir singh ne sainikon ko saaf-saaf kaha ki seemaa paar se bade ghuspaith or aatankwaad kii lagaataar koshishon ke bich nikat bhavishya main choti ladaaiyon ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 From this statement, it can be inferred that if Pakistan's stilted attitude against terrorism continues, India can take limited action to destroy the terrorist camps in the areas of Pakistan
 6
 The international community is also concerned given the apprehensions of the international community, the continued escalation of firing on the border and the harsh statements coming from both sides
 china ne donon deshon se sanyam baratane kii apil kii he
 Also, US National Security Advisor Susan Rice made an emergency visit to Pakistan and met the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif there
 bharat-pakistan ke bich tanaav ke saath-saath antarrashtriya samudaay ke chintaa kii ek or baat he
 That is the possibility of nuclear weapons being planted in Pakistan by terrorists
 7
 Constant unrest on the border this year, the ceasefire has been broken by Pakistan 240 times
 keval agast maheene main 55 baar sijafire tode jane kii ghatana hui
 In the last two weeks, three general people died and nine were injured in the border firing of Sehui across the border
 15 agast par bhi pakistan kii ore se bharat ke ilaakon memphyring kii gai thi
 Pakistan has broken a ceasefire 95 times after a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif on July 10 in Ufa, Russia
 8
 The judicial process in the Mumbai attacks, India has little hope of action in the courts of Pakistan against the accused in the Mumbai attacks
 lakhvi samet tamaam aropiyon ke khilaaf adaalat main pakistani agenciyon kii ore se laaparvaah sthiti apanaai gai
 In such a situation, India is unlikely to get any justice from Pakistan against the perpetrators of Mumbai attacks
 9
 The internal situation of Pakistan has deteriorated within Pakistan in recent times, indicating that it will lead to war
 taliban samet tamaam aantki sanghathan ek taraf jahaan pakistan ke baahar sajeesh ko anjaam dene ke saath-saath desh ke andar hi lagaataar hamale kar rahe hai
 There are frequent suicide bombings in Quetta
 iske alaava baluchistan main kabyli ladaakon ke khilaaf sena ke abhiyaan ke baad vahaan ladaai tej hoti ja rahi he
 If you look at the history, whenever Pakistan starts facing internal crisis, then to overcome it, it adopts a policy of imposing war on India
 haalanki, ab tak ke chaaron yuddh 1948, 1965, 1971 or 1999 ke kargil yuddh main pakistan ko haar kaa munh hi dekhnaa padaa he
 10
 bharat sarkaar par badhata dabaavabharat sarkaar ke liye bhi mushkil samay he
 Pakistan is resorting to the Kashmir issue to avoid negotiations coming to the table
 antarrashtriya manch par bharat is mudde ko le ja nahin saktaa kyonki vah lagaataar dwipaksheeya taur par samaadhaan kii baat karata he
 The perpetrators of all the terror attacks, including the Mumbai attacks, are protected in Pakistan and Pakistan is not ready to accept it
 seemaa paar se lagaataar golibari jari he or pakistan ulta bharat hi aarope lagata he
 In such a situation, there is increasing public pressure on the government in India to teach Pakistan a lesson
 aise main nikat bhavishya main bharat sarkaar ko pakistan main maujuud aatanki tatwon or daaud ibrahim jaise tatwon ke khilaaf simit karrwai kerani pad sakati he
 The statement of the Army Chief is pointing to this situation

 Javed Akhtar wrote on his Twitter account that bjp's choice of Bhopal Lok Sabha seat is truly exemplary
 sadhvi pragna (sadhvi Pragya) vichaar or kaary se sangh parivaar kii sahi vyaktitv hai
 Wow ! Wow ! The choice of the BJP for the candidate in Bhopal is indeed immpeccable
 Sadhvi Pragya is the perfect prosonification of sangh parivar's thoughts and actions
 Wah! Wah !! Wah !!! On this tweet by Javed Akhtar, Bollywood producer Ashok Pandit responded by writing that a politician whose wife was allegedly murdered, which the Congress tried its best to thwart the investigation Of

 bade aashcharya kii baat he kyonki ghati main kuch aise log bhi hai joki pratyaksh or apratyaksh taur se aatanki samoohon ke saath sambandh rakhte hai
 Javed Akhtar wrote that i thought you were suffering, so i thought you would be more sensitive on this matter
 So you have no problem with the Sadhvi 
 a bit surprising because there are some profiled persons in the valley who have direct or indirect connection with the terror groups but so far it has not been proved
 You have suffered so i thought you will be more sensitive about it 
 Let us tell you that Sadhvi Pragya formally joined BJP on Wednesday and within hours he was also made a candidate from Bhopal seat
 bhopal seat (bhopal Lok Sabha Seat) par sadhvi pragna kaa sidhaa muqabla digvijay singh se hai
 Sadhvi Pragya had said that by winning from Bhopal, i will elevate the honor of saffron

 Amid the political turmoil in Bihar, it is a serious challenge for the BJP to defeat the JD-U while retaining the number of its current Lok Sabha mps
 gathbandhan main bijepi loksabhaa kii 40 siton main se 17 seat par ladati ai he, jisamen se abhi party ke paas 12 saansad he
 But in the changed political equation, he is finding it difficult to keep his seat
 vaise bhi bijepi ko narendra modi kaa effects bihar main dikh rahaa he, lekin phir bhi party koi jokhim uthaane ke mood main nahin he
 For every Lok Sabha seats, the party has internally engaged in equation and assessment of profit and loss
 isamen se ab bhagalpur loksabhaa seat par party kii raah aasaan nahin dikh rahi
 From here, bjp's Muslim face Shahnawaz Hussain is the MP, while before him was former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi MP who resigned after becoming Deputy Chief Minister in the state
 jedy-you se gathbandhan hone kii vajah se bhagalpur main shahanvaj hossain kii raah aasaan ho gai thi, lekin ab sthiti sahaj nahin he
 This time from Bhagalpur, Sushil Kumar Modi himself has made up his mind to contest
 aise main sabase zyada mushkil shahanvaj hossain kii he, jinke liye koi aasaan seat najar nahin aa rahi
 Not seeing the situation from Bhagalpur easily, Shahnawaz was planning to contest from Purnia seat, but there are now Uday Singh mps from BJP
 is seat se is baar congress sambhavatya bahubali pappu yadav ko chunaav main utaar sakati he, aise main purniya seat bhi unke liye mufeed sabit nahin ho rahi
 So Shahnawaz has now started saying within the party that Sushil Modi should be fought from Bhagalpur

 Develop a compound life culture and not a demonstrable ability

 yogi kisi ke bare main katu baat kar hi nahin saktaa
 Can yoga leaders do this? isliye ve netaa hai, yogi nahin
 Life is not the solution with yoga, but a lifestyle based on it shows us the way to a balanced life
 ham us par to chalate nahin, yogabhyas samaapt hote hi man vachan or karm se duusare ko parrast karne ke khel main lag jate hai
 a yogi cannot talk bitterly about anyone
 kya yoga karne vaale netaa aisa kar sakate hai
 Therefore they are leaders, not yogis

 In fact, the police had earlier issued a directive that such couples be removed by warning, but the new directive issued on Thursday said that patrolling in such areas will be increased so that the couples do not fall prey to any unwanted elements
 police kii daleel he ki yah ek 'ehtiyaati' kadam hoga, taaki premi jode badmaashon ke haathon na sataae ja saken or unke shikaar na bane
 During a recent meeting, selected police stations were instructed to keep a close watch on the secluded areas of the areas under their jurisdiction, where the loving couple often meet
 farmaan ke mutabik yadi premi jode ekant main baithe najar aaen to unhen turant vahaan se jane ko kaha jaae

 According to Farman, if the lovers are seen sitting in seclusion, they should be asked to leave immediately
 ekant main baithe jode ko khatra samajhakar laut jane ke liye kaha jayega, lekin yadi ve aisa nahin karte hai to mumbai police kanoon kii sambandhit dhaaraon ke tahat unke khilaaf karrwai karegi

 in filmo kin kahani bhale hi kaalpanik hoti he, magar zyaadaatar kisse real life se uthaae jate hai
 Now take the latest example

 Jasbir Bijendra Bhati has directed this film
 film main jimmy shergill or archana puuran singh ke saath om puri or sanjay mishra jaise kalakaaron ne ahm bhoomikaayen nibhaai hai
 Dhanraj Jethani, Anil Jethani and Chandresh Jethani have earlier made the film 'ankur Murder Case', which was much appreciated
 film ke nirmaataa kaa kahana he ki 'ankur murder cese' se hamen shaabaashi mili or himmat mili
