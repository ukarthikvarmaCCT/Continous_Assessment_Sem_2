 ise thik karne kaa koi solid tarika bhi nahin he, kyonki is bag vaale massej ko delit karnaa bhi mushkil he
 This is not the first time that such a problem has occurred in ios, but last year, only a URL caused the iphone to crash, after which Apple released a new update

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The police has resolved the case of the body of the girl, recovered two weeks ago from Daryaganj area of delhi
 sonia naamak us ladki kaa katl uske do doston ne hi milakar kiya tha
 The police have arrested both
 is maamle main mritka or aropiyon ke haath par gude ek jaise tatu ahm suraag sabit hue
 In fact, on the night of 14 May, Dariyaganj police station, Eklarki's corpse was murdered from DTC Park
 jise berahami se katl kiya gaya tha
 Not only this, to erase his identity, the slayer had crushed his face badly with stones
 uske sir par gahari chot ke nishaan the
 The police knew that the murder had been executed in a vicious manner
 kyonki kaatilon ne laash ke aasapaas koi aisa subut bhi nahin choda tha ki marane vaali ladki kii pahchaan kii ja sake
 It was clear that the murderer was very vicious
 police ne jab laash kii jaanch kii to mritka ke haath par do tatu najar aae
 "rahul Kumar" and "soni Ya Sozi" were written in Hindi on the hand
 iske baad shuru hui ek lambii padtaal
 The police investigated the reported missing in nearby police stations but found no clue
 phir police ne kareeb 4 hajaar se zyada logon se poochtacha kii
 The police got some clues in this inquiry
 is dauraan police ne rickshawvaalon or aasapaas ke pub main bhi poochtacha kii
 Then the police came to know that the name of the girl who died was Sonia
 mritka kii shinaakht ho jane ke baad police ne sonia ke tamaam doston or dushmano kii list banaai or ek-ek kar sabase poochtacha shuru kii
 Salman alias Rahul and Kalia were also in the list of friends
 police ne paaya ki un donon ke haath par bhi usee tarah kaa tatu tha jaisaa ki sonia ke haath par tha
 Both of them also had SRK on their hands
 poochtacha main donon ne bataaya ki s se unka matlab sonia, r se rahul or k se kaaliya tha
 Both of them confessed to the murder when the police strictly questioned both of them
 police ko pataa chalaa ki donon ladke sonia ke saath kaam karte the
 Both of them suspected that Sonia was cheating on them
 darasal, jaanch main saamne aayaa he ki ye sabhi colgirl racket se jude hai
 Kalia then persuades Rahul that Sonia is cheating, he has connections with other people as well
 donon ne 14 may kii raat ko jamkar sharaab pi
 Then on the pretext, he took Sonia with him to DTC Park in Daryaganj and brutally murdered Sesonia there
 jis din sonia kaa katl hua, us din mausam behad kharaab tha
 Therefore, the police could not get a clue even from the CCTV footage
 ab police ne donon aropiyon ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya he
 After the Shiv Sena, the Telugu Desam Party, another constituent of the NDA, can leave the BJP
 bajet par tidipi ne kadi pratikriya dete hue ise andhra pradesh kii janata ke saath dhokhaa bataaya he
 At the same time, the party has described the Union Budget as anti-people and beneficial for businessmen
 tidipi andhra pradesh ko vishesh sahaayta dene par centre ke deele rukh se bhi naaraaz bataai ja rahi he
 According to sources, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu is seriously considering it
 naidu ne ravivaar ke din partisansadon ko is mudde par charchaake liye bhi bulaayaa he
 The party has 16 mps in Lok Sabha and 6 in Rajya Sabha
 naidu ko anya vikalpon se parhez nahin!sutron ne is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ki naidu anya raajnneetik vikalpon par bhi vichaar kar rahe hai
 The party is also taking opinions from the public about whether it should stay with the BJP till 2019 or else separate and contest elections
 PM se kii dakhal kii mangparty ke ek varisht netaa ne bataaya ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko andhra main 2 fisad vot mili the, lekin agle chunaav main ye vot fisad badhkar 6 tak ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the party will have to make a plan to make up for this loss before it gets separated
 party ke ek anya netaa ne kaha ki naidu naaraaz hai or unhone pradhanmantri se milakar apni aapatti darj bhi karai thi, lekin uskaa zyada asar padaa nahin, ab agar piem dakhal den to mudda sulajh saktaa he
 Another leader of TDP said that now there are few options left, one of them is that we should tell BJP that TDP will withdraw its ministers from the cabinet if our demands are not met
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki naidu rajya ke liye uchit aarthik madad or telugana ke gathan ke baad lambit padi yojanaon kii manjuuri main deree se naaraaz he
 After Hyderabad moves to Telangana, Andhra is struggling with revenue difficulties
 adhar main andhra kii yojanaenkendre sarkaar main tidipi cote se ek mantri ne kaha ki 8 agast 2016 kii madhya raatri ko charchaa ke baad centre ne aandh pradesh ko vishesh package dene par sahmati jataai thi, jiske baad tidipi alag rajya kii maang ko waapas lene ke liye bhi taiyaar ho gai thi
 But since then the state has not received a single penny of the package
 tidipi kaa kahana he ki vishakhapatnam ko jonal railway banane, kadappa steel plant ko manjuuri jaisi kai anya aisi maang hai jo abhi tak puri nahin hui hai
 TDP has been continuously targeting its ally BJP for the last few months
 is bich wiesar congress ke chif vaai es jagan mohan reddy bhi isamauke ko bhunaane main jutehain
 Jagan has already made it clear that he is ready to join the NDA if the Center gives Andhra a special state status
 nae saathi kii talash!tidipi ke sutron ke mutabik bijepi agar wiesar congress ke saath haath milaane ko taiyaar ho jaati he to naidu ke paas plan b taiyaar he
 Under this plan, TDP can tie up with small but popular party Jan Sena, which will prove to be a better alternative to TDP than BJP
 gathbandhan main daraar bijepi ke liye acchhee khabar nahin he
 The BJP, which is trying to expand its reach in the south, cannot proceed without local allies in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra
 doosraa agar bijepi is vakt tidipi kaa saath chhod wiesar congress se haath milaati he to isse galat sandesh ja saktaa he, kyonki wiesar pramukh jagan pehle hi bhrashtachar ke aaropon se ghire hai

 Shah Rukh Khan was earlier finalized for Rakesh Sharma's biopic
 lekin kinhin kaarnon se vah project se baahar ho gaye
 He was reported to have left the film for the hit franchise Don 3
 ek report ke mutabik produsar roni scruwala uri main vicky ke parformens ko dekhakar bahut prabhavit hue hai
 So he has now finalized Vicky for Sare Jahan Se Achcha
 aisi bhi khabar he ki vicky ne apane kirdaar ke liye taiyaari bhi shuru kar di he
 The first choice for this biopic was Aamir Khan but others were busy with the project
 isliye kuch bhi final nahin ho paaya

 There were two major changes in Rajasthan last fortnight
 do shakhsiyaton ko unki maujuuda haisiyat se bedakhal kar diya gaya
 Both have been close to Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 badlaav us vakt hue jab raaje ek bijness sammelan main singapore gai hui thim
 On October 16, his Chief Secretary Rajiv Maharshi was transferred to Delhi as the Union Finance Secretary and on October 10, his old friend and former IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi was removed from the post of Chairman of Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA)
 takhtapalat kar lalit ko hataane vaale amin pathan bhi raaje ke vafaadaar hai
 He has also been an assistant to Modi
 donon badlaavon ke peeche kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali kaa haath mana ja rahaa he
 Both Jaitley and Maharishi have very good relations
 jetali lambey samay se unhen apane saath laana chaahate the
 However, Jaitley has been strongly against Modi in matters of cricket
 maharishi bhi kabhi modi ke kareebi the
 But like Raje in recent times, he too has been seen as neutral in cricket matters
 to kya modi ko bedakhal kar dene se jetali khush ho gaye tab mahash kaa tabadalaa vitt mantralay main kiya gaya? maharishi kaa centre main vitt sachiv bananaa badi baat nahin he
 In December 2013, he was the Secretary of Chemicals and Fertilizers before Raje made him his Chief Secretary
 ve raaje ke kaamyaab vitt sachiv bhi rah chuke hai
 After working as the Finance Secretary in Delhi, he will also be helped in filing a claim to become Cabinet Secretary
 agast, 2015 main maharishi kaa sevakaal puraa hona he
 If he becomes cabinet secretary, he will get a two-year service extension
 lekin kya pradhanmantri ek aise shaks ko cabinet sachiv bananaa chahenge jise raaje or jetali kaa kareebi mana jaataa he? vaise aane vaale vakt main yah raaje or narendra modi ke bich vyapak sahmati kaa hissaa bhi ho saktaa he
 Before leaving for Singapore, Raje caused quite a stir with his unexpected statement
 unhone kaha tha ki bijepi kii jeet kaa shrey kisi ek vyakti ko nahin diya ja saktaa
 However, Raje immediately clarified that his intention was not to target the Prime Minister
 lekin raajnneeti main mol-tol ke liye aisi ranneetiyaan koi nai baat nahin hai
 Raje has kept himself away from the controversy related to the Lalit Modi coup
 mahmud abdi ke netritv main modi kii team aaarasie ke kaaryakari adhyaksh kaa pad sanbhaalane vaale amin pathan ke khilaaf adaalat main ladaai lard rahi he
 The battle between Pathan and the Lalit faction has exposed some dirty truths
 pathan ne lalit gut par aarope lagaaya he ki usne vakeelon ko karodon rupee kii fees chukaai thi
 According to the charge, this fee was also paid to some lawyers who were ahead in opposing Raje's attempt to get the Jalmahal agreement canceled by the Supreme Court
 vahiin abdi ne aarope lagaaya ki virodhiyon ne isliye takhtapalat kiya kyonki aaarasie ne unki yatra or anya kharche dena band kar diya
 He also says, "when the High Court directed the BCCI to select players from Rajasthan without using the RCA banner, why did Pathan revolt?" Pathan insists that Raje or Jaitley have no hand behind this rebellion
 unhone india today se kaha, ''lalit modi aaarasie se bisisiai kaa pratibandh hatwane main naakaam rahe
 Were
 ve hamaare phone colls kaa jawaab tak nahin dete the, ham sab is baat se ajiz aa chuke the
 The only way to take cricket forward was to remove Modi and gain BCCI recognition
 ''raaje ke in do karibiyon kaa rajya ke maamalon se hatana madad hi karegaa
 By going to Maharishi's center, she can get some more help for the state
 isi tarah lalit kaa hatana rajya cricket ke liye acha he
 The BCCI has banned the Lalit-led RCA, which is now expected to be lifted
 duusari ore isse raaje or modi ke bich duuri paatane main bhi madad milegi—vah duuri jo kendriya mantrimandal main rajya se keval ek saansad ko shaamil karne or usase bhi zyada raaje ke bete dushyant singh ko centre main mantri nahin banane se dikh rahi thi

 The victim accused her of trying to rape her
 lekin police kii sakht karrwai nahin hone se vah dukhi thi
 Superintendent of Police Shalini said that the two sides were detained by the police on a notice of a dispute between two families in a village in Badusa police station area during Holi
 ab tak kii jaanch main graminon ke bayanon se spasht hua he ki ladki ke bhai ne use do ladakon ke saath aapattijanak sthiti main dekha tha, jiske baad vah use khet se ghar tak pitayee karte hue laayaa tha

 Now the waste caused by this inundation is being estimated
 jin logon ko bachaane main yah desh laga he, ve is baat kaa jawaab jaananaa chaahate hai ki aakhir rajya or centre sarkaar ne itani badi traasadee ko aise hi kaise guzar jane diya or kyon ab jaakar 1,500 karod ru
 Help is being given and trucks filled with relief material are being sent out in a festive atmosphere
 is sailaab ke shikaar log puch rahe hai ki jab kharaab mausam kii chetavanee pehle hi de di gai thi to 10,000 logon ko kedarnath ke chattani ilaake main jamaa hi kyon hone diya gaya? aakhir un 233 gaanvon ko unki kismat ke sahare kyon chhod diya gaya jinhen ‘‘durghatana sambhavit’’ shrenee main rakhaa gaya tha? aakhir kyon nijee companiyon ko ganga, alaknanda or bhagirathi ke 70 fisadi pani kii raah badalane or niyantrit karne kii chhot di gai? bina permit ke aakhir pahaado ke kinare kukuramute kii tarah hotalon, dukaanon or gharon ko kyon ugane diya gaya? aakhir 2010 main aapadaa prabandhan or gram panchayaton ke prashikshan ke liye aavantit 123 karod ru
 Where did the amount of money go? They are asking why there was no exchange of information between disaster management, geology and meteorological departments? And the biggest question is what is the strategy to rehabilitate the local people who lost everything in this inundation? The incident is believed to be due to the bursting of the Vasukital glacier lake located 14,200 feet north-east of Kedar valley
 Due to this, the swollen water came down rapidly towards Kedarnath and transformed this religious place into a rocky ground of destruction

 He said at the press meeting, "at least Sheila ji has asked for an inquiry
 lekin pradhanmantri modi ne aisa kyon nahin kiya?" Rejecting reports of being angry with the party, Sheila Dixit said, "she is not keeping distance from the party due to this controversy
" mujhe aligarh nahin janaa tha

 It is learned that Asaram was also accused of having unnatural sex with several girls before being accused of rape
 gandhinagar magistrate court main daayar kii gai chargeshit se asaram ke is ghinaune krity se paradaa uthaa he
 According to the 1000-page charge sheet, Asaram used to have unnatural sex with the victim of Surat (who has filed a case) and other 6 girls as oral sex (section 377)
 chargeshit main asaram par kai sangeen dharaaen lagaai gai hai jaise dhara 376 (rape), dhara 377 (aprakritik sex), dhara 342 (bandhak banane), dhara 120 bi (aapraadhik shadyantr) or dhara 201 (aparaadh ke saboot mitaane)
 According to the chargesheet, Asaram along with other accused sexually abused the Surat girl from 2001 to 2007

 Apart from Asaram, the chargesheet also includes the names of his wife Lakshmi, daughter Bharati and several disciples such as Dhruvben, Nirmala, Jassi and Meera

 notebandi ke baad desh main kai nikaay chunaav hue
 In most cases, the decision came in favor of the BJP
 par sabase bada faisla guuruuvaar ko aarthik rajdhani mumbai se aayaa
 For the first time, the BJP emerged as the second largest party, contesting alone here
 paanch saal pehle shivasena ke saath gathbandhan main mahaj 31 siten jeetne vaali bijepi is baar 81 vaardon par akele kabja kar rahi he
 Not only this, the BJP has dominated 8 out of 10 municipalities, performing brilliantly throughout Maharashtra
 akele ladane kaa phayda hua bijepi kobiemasi yani brihanmumbai mahanagarapalikake liye mangalvaar ko vot daale gaye the
 The results have made it clear that the Shiv Sena, which is showing eye to BJP again and again, will not be able to hold on to the BMC on its own
 vidhansabha chunaavon kii tarah shivasena ne alag ladakar mumbai par kabja chaha par is faisle main phayda bijepi ko ho gaya
 BJP last contested only 69 seats
 lekin gathbandhan na ho paane par is baar usne sabhi siton par daavedaari pesh kii
 The BMC also likes it, the Shiv Sena and the BJP will not be able to rule alone, but the JD-S Shiv Sena may have become the single largest party by winning 84 seats, but if its victory is compared to the previous elections, the result is worth celebrating for the party
 So it is not
 pichhali baar yani 2012 ke biemasi chunaav main shivasena ne 158 siton par chunaav ladaa tha or 75 siten jiti thim
 This time despite winning all the seats, she could win only 84 seats
 uddhav bijepi ko is baar mahaj 60 seat dene par ade the lekin usne 81 siten jeet leen
 In 2012, BJP won 32 after contesting 69 seats
 is baar wo 114 seat maang rahi thi
 What will happen to the political victory? The bjp's record seats in BMC and its spectacular performance across Maharashtra show that its grip in the state is as strong as the assembly elections
 shivasena agar satta sukh chaahati he to use biemasi main bijepi se haath milaanaa hoga or rajya main bhi fadanvis sarkaar ko samarthan jari rakhana hoga
 Apart from this, his attacks on the BJP going beyond a border will also be a thing of the past
 haa lekin agar uddhav alag raah chunate hai to na to mumbai main, na maharashtra main or na hi centre kii satta main unka koi role rah jayega

 And a photo of PM Modi to drive them away
 
 
 
 All this is a part of bjp's election campaign
 dilli main emsidi chunaav ke liye bijepi nae nae nuskhe nikaal rahi he, isi main se ek he nukkad naatak
 For the Nukkad drama, Delhi BJP has prepared an entire team of professional actors, who will promote the BJP in different places across Delhi
 prachaar ko ek nayaa rang dene ke liye bijepi ne dilachasp tarika nikaala he, iske liye dilli ke jwalanth muddon ko lekar choti-choti kahaniyaan likhi gayi he or in kahaniyon ke aadhaar par drishy taiyaar kiye gaye hai, jo nukkad naatak kii shakl main saamne aaenge
 It is clear that at the center of the stories is the government of Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party and the target is Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal
 in sabhi paatro ko pirokar alag-alag nukkad naatak taiyaar kiye hai, jinhen rochak sanvaadon se sajaayaa gaya he
 According to BJP leader Narendra Tandon, who is watching the campaign work, the issues through which the BJP has tried to surround Kejriwal and his government through the street theater are issues that are already in the media and public, including advertisements
 But to spend from the state exchequer, distribute revisors to its mlas, criminal cases against mlas, problems of electricity and water and not using the car bungalow Spoken by including issues such as reap all the benefits
 isi tarah ke ek nukkad naatak main aam aadmi party kii aitihaasik jeet or uske baad mantri kii farji degree, bhrashtachar kii vajah se mantri ko hataanaa, balalkar kaa aarope, 21sansadeey sachivonse jude maamalon ko dikhaaya gaya he, jinamein bhrashtachar kaa bhoot banaaya gaya he or dikhaaya gaya he ki kejariwal sarkaar ke ghotaale rupi bhuton se dilli pareshaan he
 When these ghosts are shown the photo of Modi, one by one the ghosts run away
 ab bijepi kii koshish in nukkad naatakon ke zariekejariwal sarkaarko expoj karne kii he, party ko ummid he ki jo baat wo bhaashan or postaron ke jariye kehete aae hai, un baton ko nukkad naatakon ke zarie votaron ko aasaani se samajha paaenge
 At present, the time limit for gratuity is 5 years
 Preparing to reduce the limit from 5 years to 1 year, the Modi government may soon give very good news to the employed people
 khaskar privet sector main kaam kar rahe logon ko sarkaar ke is kadam se bada phayda hoga
 It is reported that the government is preparing to change the rules of Social Security and Gratuity
 darasal philhal gracuty kii paatrata ke liye ek company main kam se kam lagaataar 5 saal tak kaam karnaa padataa he
 But by changing this, the government is preparing to give relief to the common working people
 philhal 5 saal kii naukari par milti he gracutimedia reports kii maane to sarkaar gracuty ke liye 5 saal ke time ko ghataakar mahaj ek saal karnaa chaahati he
 There are reports that the government may introduce a bill related to it in the coming winter session of Parliament
 bataa den, isse sabase zyada phayda un logon ko hoga, jo ek saal ke baad naukari badal dete hai
 After the new rule, they will get gratuity if they change jobs after one year
 privet karmchaariyon ko hoga bada phaaydahalanki sarkaar kii ore se abhi tak isko lekar koi adhikarik ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he
 Let me tell you, currently the time limit of gratuity is 5 years
 gracuty karmchaariyon ko milane vaali ek prakaar kii rakam he, jo karmchaariyon ko extra laabh detaa he
 What is gratuity? Gratuity is given by the company to its employees
 yah ek tarah se karmchaaree kii taraf se company ko di gai seva ke badale dekar uskaa saabhaar jataayaa jaataa he
 Its maximum limit is 20 lakh rupees
 vartmaan main gracuty karmchaaree ko tabhi milti he jab wo ek company main paanch saal tak kaam karata he
 However, in case of death or incapacitation, it is not necessary to complete 5 years of the job to be given gratuity amount
 imploir ke liye imploi ke naukari chhodane, ritair hone, mrityu yaa uske aksham hone par 30 din ke andar gracuty die jane kaa praavdhaan he
 If this does not happen within the stipulated period, then the employer will have to pay the gratuity amount along with the interest fixed by the government
 aise tay hoti he gracutiapako kitni gracuty milegi, ye do factors par nirbhar karata he
 First, how many years you served in the company
 doosraa, aapaki last selary ke aadhaar par
 In this, calculation is done for 15 days of the last salary of every year of service
 selary main aapkaa basic or dearnes alouns bhi shaamil hota he
 Here is the formula for deciding the gratuity: 15X Last Salary x Years of service / Understand for example Rahul is an engineer who has given 20 years service to his company
 unki last selary 20 hajaar rupee thi
 (15X20,000X20) / 26 = Rs 2,30,769
 aise main unki gracuty kii jo rakam banegi, wo 2 lakh 30 hajaar 769 rupee hogi

 holi ko beete do din ho chuke the
 It will be ten in the morning
 chatti kii apni-apni pasandida jagahon par baithkebaajon kaa jamaavada jam chukaa tha
 People came to and from some nearby villages for some work
 kandhe par gamchaa rakhe yaa sir par baandhe, gadori main kheni ragadate
 The colors of Holi were still visible on many of them, with their washed vest or kurte-dhoti
 skool khul chuke the, par baithkbaj master log skool jane ke bajaay jayanath halwai kii dukaan par baithe akhbaar baanch yaa kisi baat par bahes rahe the
 Jaynath, as always, listened to all these things, was unheard of, was busy in burning coal, boiling tea and disposing of customers
 haalanki uski dukaan par aane waalon main kai aise hote, jinhen na chaay pini hoti, na kuch khareednaa-khaanaa hota
 They would simply go through the news of the newspaper, which would become the news, and be it or sit between the meeting masters, the village's youths for some time, and hit the head and face a problem in Delhi, Lucknow, Patna or US-UK etc
 us din bhi kuch aisa hi maahaul tha
 The equation of the general election to be held after one and a half years was published in the newspaper
 usamen phir se sattarudh rajpa yani rashtriya janhit party ke sarkaar banane kaa akalan pesh tha
 This was the first time in the memory of the people, which started appearing in the newspapers about the general election so long ago
 bas, logon ko apni raay dene, bahesane kaa bharpoor masala mil gaya tha
 If people in our country get the election equation, then their ration-water, loss and sickness worries everyone
 fursatiya master to aise avasaron par aisa-aisa gyaan dete hai ki sarkaar or raajnneetik partiyaan sun len to apni ranneeti badalane ko sochane lagen
 So, she was walking on it
 jayanath se shaayad kuch logon ne chaay talab kii thi, so vah apane aluminium ke bhagone ko baar-baar bhatthi se uthaa kar, hilaa-hilaa kar ufanti chaay ko shant karne or pakaane main laga hua tha
 As always, he was not giving any response even after listening to people's debates
 jayanath ek manoranjak or anokhaa charitra tha
 It is not that he does not know about the world or world, or he has no opinion on the news printed in the newspaper
 par vah praayah gambhir or chup rahata tha
 Age of fifty-one
 aadhi baanh kii kameez or lungi yaa patalun ko kaat kar banaai half pant pahane apane kaam main laga rahata
 That day was also felt
 jayanath ke graahak tay hai, jaise janm-janmaantar se hai or rahenge
 Jayanath's father Dhaniram started a tea shop on this Chatti, when this road was newly built and there was no practice of drinking tea in the villages
 magar log pakora, masaaledaar uble chane, samose, jalebi, besan ke seve-dalmoth, khaja-khajuli, laddu-tikri vagairah khaane-kharidne aa jaaya karte the
 Then only two government buses used to ply on that road throughout the day
 so, ikkaa-dukka log hi aate-jate the
 But Dhaniram kept the tea shop open
 isaki vajah jo bhi rahi ho
 It may be that Dhaniram thought it better to do his work than to catch plow in someone's field
 yaa phir ve itane doordarshee the ki unhen andaja rahaa ho ki jaise-jaise samay beetegaa, yah chatti gulzaar hogi or unki aane vaale pidiyon ke liye yah dukaan sahaara banegi
 So, Dhaniram stood on the rock without getting involved in the mathematics of loss and profit
 ve paas ke gaanv se apana parivaar laakar vahiin sadak kinare madi main rahane lage the
 Dhaniram stayed and kept his only son Jayanath with him
 is tarah jayanath paidaa hote hi apane pita kii chaay kii dukaan kaa karmchaaree ban gaya tha
 His first task as soon as he woke up in the morning was to fill coal in the furnace and set it on fire
 vah subah ankhen malate hue, jhapai lete uthta or koyala dhadhakaate-dhadhakaate, ankhon main koyale kaa dhuaan bhar puri tarah chaitanya ho jaataa
 After burning the coal, he would take a bath in a nearby puddle and then get ready to go back to school
 dhaniram chaahate the ki jayanath unka kaam siikhe jarur, par unki tarah nirakshar na rahe
 So, they used to send him to school
 jayanath ne aathvin ke baad skool se sanyas le liya or chatti par chaay kii dukaan sambhaal lee
 While Dhaniram was alive, he remained the head of the shop, but he had given the son complete freedom to experiment
 dhire-dhire sadak chalane lagi, chatti par chahal-pahal badhane lagi
 Customers also started growing at Dhaniram's shop
 chaay kaa kaarobaar badhata dekh kuch duuri par ek or aadmi ne chaay kii dukaan khol lee
 Then, as the years passed, another shop opened
 yani dhaniram ke kaarobaar main pratiyogita badhani shuru ho gai
 Shops continued to grow on Chatti, but Jayanath's shop was located at the most likely place i
e
 the prime location, so customers would be more frozen there
 usee dauraan jayanath ne chaay kii ‘racippi’ main badlaav kiya tha
 After cooking the tea, he hid from the customers and put some coffee powder in it
 is tarah jayanath kii banaai chaay us chatti kii baaki dukaanon se alag ho gai
 One who once drank tea made by Jayanath's hand, he did not like the tea of the other shop
 shuru main jab jayanath kii chaay kaa swaad sabase alag lagane laga, to use lekar tarah-tarah kii charchaaen hoti thim
 Someone would say, Jayanath mixes opium in tea, who gets used to it and who once drinks his tea, wants to drink it again and again
 is baat main koi shaq nahin ki yah afvaah failaane main jayanath ke pratidwandvi dukandaaron kaa haath rahaa hoga or phir usase irshyaa karne vaale kuch graahakon ne use prasaarit kiya hoga
 But this rumor did not work much
 jo uski dukaan par niyamit baithne, akhbaar baanchane, batiyaane-bahesane vaale the, unka adda vah dukaan bani rahi
 As long as Dhaniram remained alive, neither he nor Jayanath ever cheered a customer, nor did it happend
 puri thasak ke saath dukandaaree karte rahe
 He never came to the talk of the talkers
 haa, ve baaten sabaki sunate, magar uksaane par bhi apane vichaar kam hi prakat karte
 In this way, they are considered utter fools - oblivious to the world
 par vastav main jayanath aisa tha nahin
 He was definitely an eighth pass, but in many cases, he could cut off the ears of good-educated people
 jab vah koi tippanee karata, to log us par gaur karte- beshak us par der tak hansate
 These days, since the country went digital and Jayanath took a Chinese smartphone, it was also active on Facebook and whatsapp
 vahaan vah belos apane vichaar rakhata
 Apart from this, he does not know how he got a news - to speak English
 vah apni baatcheet main na sirf angreji ke shabdon kaa jaanboojh kar istemaal karata, balki bejhijak aadha-poun vaakya bhi angreji ke bol daalata
 It is difficult to say that, like the proud shopkeepers, he must have started learning and speaking English as part of the strategy to make a place in the world market
 par usamen angreji bol kar khud ko gyani yaa shreshth sabit karne kaa kutev paidaa ho gaya tha
 However, people used to make fun of him for speaking half-baked English
 aksar kuch munhalage fursatiya navhe usase angareji bolne kii farmaish karte or phir sun kar der tak ho-ho karke hansate rahete
 But this did not stop Jayanath's English speaking
 or uskaa angreji bolnaa us din kaam aa gaya
 Perhaps it was only to test her English knowledge that Saraswati, the goddess of learning, sent the English couple to her shop
 us din subah jab jayanath kii dukaan par fursatiyon kaa jamaavada jamaa tha, ek infield bullate motorcycle vahaan aakar rukii
 The white skinned man and woman riding on it stood next to the motorcycle shop and came straight to the shop after taking off the helmet from the head
 donon ne aadhi taang kii panten or sando baniyaan jaisi tishart pahan rakhi thi
 Seeing them coming to the shop, the chaos of the leisure people stopped
 sab munh baae udhar hi takataki laga baithe the
 Everyone's eyes were moving up and down from the heads of both the Firangi to the feet, as in Salman Khan's Dus Ka Dum, the needle of the machine kept going up and down for a long time before answering the correct answer
 firangi joda shaayad logon ke is tarah ghurne kaa abhyast tha, isliye vah bilkul asahaj nahin hua
 The Firangi woman went forward, folded both hands and addressed all the people sitting there and said - 'namaste!' In response, several voices emerged simultaneously - 'namaste Namaste
 ’jayanath unhen dekh kar thodi der ko to samaj hi nahin paaya ki sachmuch uski dukaan par saakshaat angrej aa viraaje hai, par pal bhar main hi vah chaitanya ho gaya tha
 He got ready and ordered the farasis sitting at an outpost almost in awe - 'move away, gibesh is to be guests
 
 
 
 Less less Shar, less mem
 
 
 shit shit
 
 
 
 ’ jab jayanath zyada shisht hokar baat karne yaa phir kisi gambhir masale par gambhir gyaan dene kaa prayaas karata, to vah isi tarah sa ko sha bolne lagata tha
 Three or four people sitting on a bench, looking at the left-winged Firangi, stood up mechanically
 jayanath ne kandhe par rakhe angoche se bench ko jhaada or firangi mehmaanon ko badi garamjoshi se bithaaya
 Then he stood up with his hands folded, and pointing with a hand to the glass box on the store, said with great confidence and familiarity - 'please take tea

 'jaynath rushed to the instant furnace and picked up the washed bhagona and put a lot of milk and some water in it and started boiling it
 firangiyon kii taraf mukhaatib hokar poocha- ‘teking sam adrakh?’abaki baar firangi ne muskaraate hue jawaab diya- ‘oke
 Meanwhile, Firangan took out a large camera from his bag hanging on his back and started taking pictures of the people sitting there
 firangi ne poocha- ‘is gaanv kaa naam kya?
 
 
 'when a Masterji sitting there tried to answer in Hindi, Jayanath jumped up -' Disha is dahkour chatti shar ji
 ’ firangi ne gardan hilaa kar jawaab sweekaar kiya
 Then asked- 'what is there to see here?' On this question, the people sitting there started to see each other's face
 vahaan koi aisi cheez dekhne laayak thi nahin, jiske bare main angrejon ko garv se bataaya ja sake
 Never did the British come as tourists in such a way that people would know what the British are interested in seeing
 sailaani firangi to aamtaur par banaras, sarnath gum kar laut jate hai
 That is why people were surprised that how did this Firangi couple come here wandering
 magar firangi purush ke sawaal kaa jawaab to dena tha, so ek master ji ne jawaab diya- ‘khet-khalihaan, gaanv-giraanv
 
 
 
 ’ or phir ho ho karke hanse
 But Jayanath felt that the answer was not given properly
 angrej itani dur khet-khalihaan, gaanv-giraanv dekhne nahin aae honge
 He replied- 'disha is bheri etihashik area Shar ji
 
 
 
 Main Mughal King Vaj Heyer
 
 
 
 Lord Cornwallish Vaj Heyer
 
 
 
 She Lord Cornwallish tomb is not in natural sheet? 
 
 ’‘haa, wo hamane dekha
 
 
 
 or kya?
 
 
 The Firangi Purush said
 firangan aasapaas kii tasviren utaarne main vyast thi
 In between, the foreigner would also listen to the words of the man and smile
 ‘phir to aage
 
 
 Seven
 
 
 at kilometre
 
 
 Nath Temple 
 
 forty-fifty kilometre dur bhrigu mandir
 
 
 
 you no na bhrigu ji
 
 
 Great astrologer

 Just
 
 
 
 And nothing
 ’ jayanath ne jawaab diya
 Meanwhile, more people had gathered from around
 fursatiyon ko vakt kaatane kaa saamaan mil gaya tha, to gaanv waalon ko ajooba drishy
 a large crowd had gathered
 sabaki nazren photo khinchati firangan kii sando baniyaan jaisi tishart main ubhari uski chatiyon or khuli taangon par tair rahi thi
 The ninths nodded to see each other and were expressing their happiness
 magar unka sukh puri tarah jaahir nahin ho paa rahaa tha
 Jayanath brought tea in two glass glasses
 unka rang dekh kar saaf pataa chal rahaa tha ki usne usamen apana sara pyaar or hunar undel diya he
 Firangan also stopped taking photos and came to drink tea
 dophirangi joda chaay pi rahaa tha or bheed jigyaasa, vismay, kauthuk, laalasaa aadi liye gheraa baandhe khadi thi
 At that time, on the motorcycle, sitting a ninth and Shobhit Thakur appeared there with a cavalcade of rearmen on three to four motorcycles
 shobhit thakur yani rashtriya janhit party- rajpa- ke yuva morcha ke jiladhyaksh
 Be it summer, winter or rain, the white kurta-pajamas would have a colorful bandit and a bright stripe around the neck
 daahine haath kii kalai main ek sau ek phere vaala kalava or maathe par laal rang kaa motaa gadha tilak
 Always put a parrot's beak-like hat on the head
 vahi topi, jise angrej yaa shahari log polo khelte hue pahante hai
 Shobhit Thakur saw the crowd in front of Jayanath's shop and stopped the motorcycle
 motorcycle kaa handls pakade-pakade qamar jhukaai, gardan lambii kii or dahini taraf paan kii peak ugali
 Then set the remaining paan aside and asked the question - "how is the crowd busy, brother?" 
 
 , bidesi mehmaan aae hai, yahaan aasapaas kii jagahen dekhnaa chaahate hai
 a master told excitedly
 magar shobhit thakur motorcycle se nahin utre
 Thought for a while
 man hi man apane aap se kuch baaten kin
 Immediately, a thought flashed within them, or a thought that had been there for years, came to fruition
 unke chehre par aashwasti prakat hui or motorcycle par baithe-baithe vahiin se aawaaj di- ‘halo jentilman
 Less less, less heir
 
 
 
 The Firangi couple looked at Shobhit Thakur
 unke pahanaave or bolne ke andaaj se unhone andaja laga liya hoga ki yah is ilaake kaa koi vishisht vyakti he
 So, holding a glass of tea in hand, both got up and reached Shobhit Thakur
 bheed bhi udhar hi golakaar ho gai
 'fram what country coming?' Shobhit Thakur asked while dumpling the pan
 ‘from yugoslavia
 The Firangi Purush replied with a smile
 ‘oke
 In America Are England? ' Shobhit Thakur's second question
 ‘no no, its yugoslavia
 '' Understand Understand
 
 
 landan ke bagal main na
 
 
 
 to, you waant si plasces aaf hear?’‘yes
 The Firangi Purush said with a smile
 ‘oke
 i will so you places
 
 
 
 less less
 
 
 ’‘yahaan kya-kya imparteynt he?’ firangi purush ne chaay kaa khaali gilaas rakhte hue poocha
 Then he turned to Jayanath and asked- 'how much money?' Jayanath shook both hands and said- 'no no, no money
 
 
 
 Are you my guest people? 
 
 ai naat teking mani fram mehmaan log
 
 
 
 ’par firangi ne jabardastee jayanath ke haath main pachaas rupye kaa note rakh diya or muskaraate hue bolaa- ‘aap bahut acha aadmi
 
 
 
 and yor inglish ij veri good
 'jaynath was overwhelmed
 ab shobhit thakur ko samaj aa gaya ki bevajaah angreji gitpitane kii jarurat nahin padegi
 The Firangi couple understands Hindi
 so, ve hindi main shuru ho gaye
 'come, come with me, let me show you what is worth seeing here
 ’ shobhit thakur ne kaha or motorcycle ek taraf khadi kar di
 The rest of the villagers also parked motorcycles everywhere
 phir shobhit thakur firangiyon ko jayanath kii dukaan ke peeche pokhar or mandir kii taraf le chale
 The crowd and the crowd also followed them
 shobhit thakur ne samajhaana-bataanaa shuru kiya- ‘yah dharti veeron or tapasviyon kii dharti he
 There were great siddhas here
 ek se ek yoddha hue
 Our distic headquarters is a very old city
 
 
 
 This earth is historical
 
 
 
 Go inside Saidpur, there is a museum of historical evidence here
 use dekh kar andaja laga sakate hai ki itihaas main is dharti kaa kitna yogadan he
 
 
 
 ’‘vah to hamane dekha
 
 
 
 ’ firangi purush ne kaha
 'jaggery
 ’ shobhit thakur prasann hue
 The puddle had arrived
 barason se sookhaa padaa, junglee ghaason se pata pokhar
 Earlier people used to take bath in this pokhar
 saal bhar saaf pani bharaa rahata
 But now due to non-removal of silt, care was not taken properly, it had become shallow and dry
 usamen chatti kii dukaanon ke juthe plastic ke gilaas-pattal-done or tamaam kachra daalaa jane laga tha
 But when Shobhit Thakur started glorifying that puddle, the eyes of the people were torn
 unhone haath uthaa kar bataanaa shuru kiya- ‘yah mauryalin pokhara he
 
 
 
 ise mahaan samraat chandragupta maury ne banwaaya tha
 
 
 
 yah dekhie iskaa ghat
 See its architecture
 jis jamaane main cement or eent kaa chalan nahin tha, tab yah ghat bana tha
 Its stairs have been at least within 100 feet
 surkhi or safed kankad kuta kar ise banaaya gaya tha
 
 
 
 dekhie, kitne sau saal guzar gaye, magar yah ghat abhi jas kaa tas bana hua he
 
 
 
 hamaare bujurg bataate the ki is ghat ke us kone main ek shilaalekh bhi laga tha, jis par pokhar ko banavaane vaale raja kaa naam or uskaa sandesh khuda tha
 
 
 
 magar ham log apni samskruti kii raksha ke maamle main itane laaparvaah hai ki us shilaalekh kii kadar hi nahin samajhi
 He was broken or lost somewhere or a stone cutter cut it into sila-lodha
 vah shilaalekh ab bas janashruti kaa hissaa he
 Very few people of our generation will know about him now
 
 
 
 Similarly, many traces of our great civilization and culture disappeared
 kuch aakrantaon ne mitaae, kuch hamaare apane logon ne mitaa daalaa
 
 
 
 afsos, ki hamaari peedi main bhi apni samskruti ko lekar bahut utsaah nahin he
 
 
 
 aap log iske bare main likhenge, to yah pokhar itihaas main darj ho jayega
 
 
 
 ’ kah kar shobhit thakur ne gardan ghuma kar munh main jamaa ho gai paan kii peak ek baar phir thuki
 The Firangi woman was taking photos of Pokhar
 pokhar ke ghat kii usne alag-alag konon se tasviren leen- dur se, najadik se
 Then along with Shobhit Thakur continued to take pictures of Firangi Purush and the crowd that had gathered together
 shobhit thakur ke pichhalgue bhi is maamle main bhala kahaan peeche rahane vaale the
 They opened their mobile phones and started taking pictures of the Firangi couple
 unhone kooda-karkat, gandagi kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr pokhar ke bheetar utar kar ghat par khadey shobhit thakur ke saath firangi jode kii kai tasviren utaar lee thim
 Shobhit Thakur then took the Firangi couple ahead of Pokhar
 mandir kii taraf
 He went on to say- 'this temple is earlier than this Pokhar
 dekhie, isaki banaavat dekhie
 See the statues kept in it
 yah hanuman ji kii murti dekhie- dronagiri parvat ko hatheli par liye, hawa main udate pavansuta or un par tir se nishaanaa saadhe badhik kii yah murti-drushyavali duniya main akeli he
 
 
 
 yah myth aapako kahin nahin milegaa
 You will not find such an idol anywhere else
 
 
 
 Then he folded both hands and bowed to the temple deities
 firangi joda shobhit thakur kii har baat ko bade dhyaan se sun rahaa tha
 Firangan was being photographed
 phir shobhit thakur kuch duuri par bane kuen kii taraf le gaye
 The well had dried up years ago, but its platform and the world were present
 kuen kii deevaaren phod kar pipal ke kuch paudhe jarur ug aae the or ab ve ped bananaa chaahate the
 Pointing towards the well, Shobhit Thakur said- 'this well is also Mauryan
 
 
 
 And see the bravery of the people here that these historical heritage were saved from the tyranny of the Mughals
 aap to jaanate hi hai ki jab mughal hamaare desh main aae to kis tarah hamaari pracheen sabhyataa or samskruti ko nasht karne kaa prayaas kiya
 But the heroes of this earth did not allow their eyes to be turned towards any of their heritage
 
 
 
 Firangan also took many pictures of that well
 vahaan yahi chijen dikhaane laayak thim, so shobhit thakur unhen dikhaa kar waapas jayanath kii dukaan kii taraf laut chale
 While walking, the Firangi Purusha asked- 'is there any establishment of Mogal period here?' On hearing the question, Shobhit Thakur's eyes widened, Bhrkuti grew, but in a blink of an eye she restrained herself and spoke with a smile on her face
 - 'no
 
 
 
 The area you are standing in is not there at all
 
 
 
 The Mughals will surely come here, because their descendants are many here, but no historical document of their time exists here
 
 
 
 Even if it had been, then the brave self-respecting people here would have wiped it out
 
 
 
 "tow, is there a lot of hindu-muslim quarrel here?" Shobhit Thakur's eyebrows rose again
 talkhi chehre par tan gai
 But once again he restrained himself
 man hi man andaja lagaaya ki firangi joda vastav main aitihaasik sthalon kii talash main niklaa he yaa sampradayik jhagade kii jaden talashne
 Talked to myself- Father-in-law, nowadays it has become fashionable to talk about communalism across the world
 is tarah bahut saare 
 
 
 Are trying to prove themselves intellectual
 
 
 
 Well, the illusion of these fair skinned people has to be eliminated
 phir
 
 
 
 ve kshan bhar main hi apane aap se batiyaa kar fursat paa gaye or bole - ‘aisa kaise kah sakate hai aap!
 
 
 There is no such quarrel
 koi tanaav nahin he donon samudaayon ke bich
 
 
 
 agar ham sahishnu na hote, to is tarah puure jile main jo bahut saare gaanvon, kasbon or shaharon ke naam musalamaanon ke naam par hai, ve kabake mitaa die gaye hote
 The villages where there is not a single Muslim, are also named after a Muslim ruler, a Muslim ala-such
 
 
 
 How can anyone say that there is a fight here? 
 
 koi jhagada nahin he
 
 
 
 sab saath mil kar rahete hai
 'firangi Purush guessed from the tone of Shobhit Thakur that the question became a little crooked
 phir bhi usne aglaa sawaal kiya- ‘to kya is aria main kabhi koi hindu-musalmaan rit
 
 
 No scare? '' No
 kabhi nahin
 All live together 
 
 
 Everyone supports each other in happiness and sorrow
 
 
 
 "but we got into the kitab that the tow was stung many times?" It has not been there for many years
 vahaan ke dangon ke peeche pichhali sarkaron kaa haath hua karata tha
 There used to be a hand in parties doing politics of appeasement
 ab vah khatm ho gaya he
 
 
 And you will see in the coming years that there will be no such riot anywhere in the country
 
 
 
 "yours is very much mysology
" ’ firangi ne muskaraate hue haath aage badhaayaa to shobhit thakur ne bhi chehre par vijayi muskaan bikherte hue haath aage kar diya
 We kept shaking hands for a long time and asked- 'your good name?' Francis
 
 
 francis bekam
 The Firangi Purush replied
 ‘and madam?’ shobhit thakur ne gardan uchakaa kar firangan kii taraf ankhon se ishaara karte hue poocha
 'eliana
 ’firangan ne apana naam suna to usne bhi haath aage badha diya
 Shobhit Thakur left Firangi's hand, grabbed Firangan's hand and placed his second palm on it
 uskaa haath apane donon haathon main lekar der tak pakade rakhaa or vihval bhav se bole- ‘good feeling tu meeting you
 
 
 
 you aar bheri good
 
 
 
 ai am shobhit
 
 
 Shobhit Thakur
 president youth wing aaf rashtriya janhit party
 
 
 
 ’ ve firangan kaa haath pakade rahe or unke pichhalgue mobile se tasviren utaarte rahe
 Firangan rescued his hands by saying thank you, then somewhere he got liberation
 ‘naaise tu meet you tu
 Firangan said
 phir baar-baar haath hilaate, haath jodate hue shobhit thakur apni motorcycle par savaar hue or usamen chaabi thunsate hue aakhri salaah di- ‘ab yahaan se kareeb das kilometre aage jaaenge to nath baba kaa mandir milegaa
 It is also a historical temple
 use jarur dekhie
 
 
 
 aaj distic headqwater main sanghathan kii jaruri baithak he, mujhe der ho rahi he, nahin to main aap logon ko vahaan jarur le chalata
 
 
 
 by by
 
 
 The Firangi couple also folded their hands and took over their motorcycle, saying thanks
 phir shobhit thakur apane kafile ke saath dakshin disha main bad chale or firangi joda uttar disha kii taraf
 Firgan, sitting behind, kept speaking bye-bye while walking away
 tinjab firangi chale gaye to vahaan jami bheed bhi chantane lagi
 But the Fursatia novices and masters sitting at Jaynath's shop again camped there
 firangan ke pahanaave or angon ko lekar chatkhaaredaar baton se silsilaa shuru hua or der tak khee-khee, fiss-fiss, hi-hi chali
 Then the matter turned and Shobhit Thakur rested on it
 ‘aho master sahib, saidpur bhitari main to guptakaleen avshesh hai na?’ gadori par kheni main chuunaa milaate hue primary skool ke fursatiya headmaster ne middle skool ke fursatiya headmaster se poocha
 'yes, it is written there
 ’ middle skool ke headmaster ne shankaa nivaaran kiya
 According to that, if we consider this pokhara as well, then it can be called Gupta period
 
 
 
 Then how was Shobhit Thakur describing it as Mauryan? There was doubt about the headmaster of the primary school
 ‘ho saktaa he, bhul gaye hon
 Our history is also entangled, there must have been some misunderstanding about the Gupta and Mauryan period
 ’ middle skool ke headmaster ne spasht kiya
 'but we have been hearing that the people of Pokhara Satgawan had dug up by making a sacrifice and the great grandfather of Rajbali Rai had built it
 
 
 
 We were unaware that there is a historical heritage next to us
 ’ padosi gaanv se gram pradhan ne apni hairaani jaahir kii
 Am
 
 
 yah to anokhi jaankaree aaj pataa chali
 
 
 
 is pokhar kaa to aaj itihaase badal gaya
 
 
 
 ’ tali peet kar kheni kii gard jhaadte primary skool ke headmaster ne kaha
 'on one such day they will change the history of the whole country, keep watching
 ’ bhagona uthaa kar ghumaate, ufanti chaay ko shant karne kaa prayaas karte hue jayanath ne tippanee kii
 Everyone laughed at this comment
 phir ek navhe ne jayanath ko hulakaara- ‘are jainath bhaiya, aap sachmuch shobhit thakur ke saath padhe the kya?’jayanath ne koi jawaab nahin diya, to primary skool ke headmaster ne uski taraf se bolnaa shuru kiya- ‘are han bhai, isamen kauno shaq he kaa? donon aathvi class tak saath padhe hai
 After the eighth Jayanath took over the shop and Shobhit started studying further
 magar dosti bani rahi
 "how far have Shobhit Thakur studied?" Navahey expressed curiosity
 ‘barahavin main latak gaye
 Twice given, but could not overcome
 phir unke babuji ne biyah kar diya or lag liye kinare
 "then how to become a leader?" Which examination has to be given to become a leader? It was written in fate that they became so 
 
 
 It was married, did not feel like farming - so open a shop here on the Chatti - to sell urea
 usamen kuch kamai thik nahin ho rahi thi, so kuch din chalaae, phir band kar diya
 a few days after that, Cement sold
 vah bhi dhandha nahin chalaa
 
 
 
 vah to kahie ki teen saal pehle chota bhai fouj main bhartee ho gaya, to ghar kaa dukh-daliddar dur ho gaya or shobhit thakur ke pankh khul gaye
 Two years before the brother got married and got a motorcycle in dowry, then he started riding it
 
 
 
 Charafer was a man from the beginning, used to sit near Madan Babu, roam with him from village to village, campaigning
 is tarah ban gaye netaa
 Now look, the fate of the party awakened, so he too woke up
 ban gaye jila yuva cameti ke adhyaksh
 Now every time, ten or twenty ninth people move back and forth
 subah-shaam darbar lagata he duaar par
 
 
 
 ’ kehete-kehete master ji ne kheni thonki or nichle hont ke neeche daab lee
 'jainath bhaiyya keep a distance from them unnecessarily! They keep opposing his party
 unke saath rahete, to aaj ye bhi tarakkee kar jate
 
 
 
 aajkal vichaardhaara dekh ke party pakadaney kaa jamaana nahin rahaa
 Wherever you have an advantage, keep the work, and close it
 party ko le ke kaa kijiega, aapako chunaav thode ladanaa he
 
 
 
 are sasur, jinako chunaav ladata he, ve khud vichaardhaara-fichaardhaara pakad ke nahin latake rahete
 Where there is an advantage, the leashes drift
 
 
 
 But Jainath Bhaiya is an emosanal
 
 
 
 Navhe again defied Jayanath
 magar jayanath maun hi rahaa
 He often does not react to such things
 kuch der sannata chaaya rahaa
 'what do you think Master Saheb, the National Public Interest Party will be at the Center next time too?' One master asked the other master
 ‘aaj akhbaar main vishleshan to yahi chapa he
 That will come
 
 
 
 It will be many more years now, brother
 
 
 
 '' But nothing has been done
 bas iske netaa bolte bahut hai?’‘koun nahin bolta he?
 
 
 Everyone speaks
 magar abhi inaki baat logon ko thik lag rahi he, so sun rahe hai
 People are listening, so they are speaking
 
 
 
 Even then there is no other option
 
 
 
 Master gave knowledge
 ‘are massaab, sahi baat to yah he ki sahi vikalp hamen hi najar nahin aata
 
 
 
 jaanboojh kar ham sahi vikalp ko dekhnaa hi nahin chaahate
 
 
 
 par koi baat nahin
 
 
 
 hamaare jivan main bahut sari chizon kii jarurat nahin hoti, phir bhi ham unhen jhelte rahete hai- jaise ki machhar
 When it rains, they start buzzing a little more
 par mausam badalte hi nasht ho jate hai
 They are also like that
 
 
 
 'this was Jayanath's comment
 sabaki najar jayanath kii taraf mudi or phir ek halki hansi ubhar kar thodaa tej ho gai
 Charoshobit Thakur had just reached the district headquarters that his smart phone had a glowing face with the name of a newborn
 motorcycle khadi kii or daftar main ghuste-ghuste shobhit thakur ne phone kaan se laga liya- ‘bolie naarayan ji?’‘bhaiya, aaj to aapane firangiyon ko jabardast samajhaayaa
 The mind became happy
 
 
 
 Everyone was praising you on Chatti
 
 
 
 But Oo Zainthwa does very little
 
 
 
 "what was he saying?" You do Janbe, he speaks upside down
 kah rahaa tha ki aap raat ko sadak par trakon kii talaashi lete hai
 
 
 
 rashtriya janhit party ke netaa to machhar kii tarah hai, barsaat beetegi, to khatam ho jaaenge
 
 
 
 kuch karnaa padegaa bhaiya, uskaa
 
 
 
 ’‘are naarayan ji, aap to jaanate hai ki uu pagalaa he
 
 
 
 usase kya ulajhna
 
 
 
 ab aap raajnneeti main aane vaale hai
 Pardhani is due to contest next year
 aise taish main aaenge, to janata aapkaa saath chhod degi
 
 
 
 prem se rahiye bhai
 
 
 
 kuch logon kii baaten sirf sunani chahie, dil par nahin leni chahie
 
 
 
 bolne dijie usko
 Pay attention to your work
 
 
 
 Yesterday evening, a morcha meeting has been held in the block office, do you remember? 
 
 apane aadamiyon ko lekar pahunchiega jarur
 
 
 
 or haa, aap to jayanath ke watsap or fasebuk par najar rakhie ki kya likhata, prachaarit karata he hamaare khilaaf
 
 
 
 baaki, kariye kuch nahin
 Keep matching, keep the blessing
 
 
 
 In politics it is more important to keep an eye on the adversary
 
 
 
 "brother, i understand
" kal milte hai block aphis main
 
 
 
 ab rakhata hum phone
 Hello brother
 ’000jila karyaalay main rashtriya janhit yuva morcha kaaryakartaaon kii baithak badi joardaar rahi
 Shobhit Thakur gave a very passionate speech
 kai dhamaakedaar kaaryayojanaayen baniin
 After that there were talks with reporters on tea-samosas
 baithak main paarit kaaryayojanaon kii suchi unhen saunpi gai
 Then Shobhit Thakur revealed the special news- 'today the couple of foreign historians came to Dahkaur Chatti
 ve yahaan kii jagahon ke itihaas kaa nae dhang se adhyayan kar rahe hai
 They have collected a lot of historical evidence here
 dahacor pokhara, vahaan ke mandir or kuen ke sthapaty ko dekh kar unhone bataaya ki ve teenon chijen maury shaskaon ne banavaai thim
 
 
 
 yah ek nayaa aitihaasik khulaasa he
 
 
 
 hamen shame aani chahie ki ham apni dharoharon ko sambhaal nahin paa rahe
 Foreign people come and tell us what things are our heritage
 
 
 
 The result of our cultural apathy is that the historical puddle is now filled with garbage, has become a dung
 
 
 
 Right now Siddheshwar Ji will provide pictures of you there
 
 
 
 Today we have passed the proposal that Dahkaur will renovate Pokhara
 iske liye mananeey mukhyamantri ji, vidhayak ji, saansad mahoday or jiladhikari mahoday ko hamane patr likhaa he
 
 
 
 ummid karte hai ki isi tarah ham duusari aitihaasik dharoharon ko bhi bachaane main safal honge
 This series will continue
 
 
 
 Thank you
 ’panaagle din saare akhabaaron ke sthaneey sanskarnon main upar ke panne par chitra sahit badi khabar thi- ‘dahacor main mila mauryalin talab’
 The caption at the bottom of the picture was- 'foreign Historian with Shobhit Thakur, President of Yuva Morcha of National Janhit Party'
 saath main pokhare main faile kachare kii bhi ek choti tasviir thi- ‘badahaal aitihaasik talab’ capshan ke saath
 With this news, the statement of Shobhit Thakur was recorded in detail
 chatti par chakallas chaalu thi
 Everyone wanted to read the news, wanted to see the picture
 chatti kii har dukaan par, akhbaar ke ek panne par das-das mundi jhukaae log baari-baari se photo dekhe ja rahe the
 Various reactions were arising with the steam of tea
 smartfondhari navhon ne akhbaar kii us khabar kii tasviir khinch yaa link natthi kar watsap par prasaarit karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 In this way, those who used to explore jokes on whatsapp all day, read, read and hahahi, they felt the matter of making them proud
 is samachar ko lekar tippanee par tippanee kiye ja rahe the
 Plans were made in making plans
 is tarah navhon main rojgaar ke nae-nae vichaar aakaar lene lage the
 
 
 
 ab dahacor chatti kaa bhavishya unhen america ke kisi chamakate shahar ke rup main najar aane laga tha
 New dreams of development were beginning to break
 udhar jayanath kii dukaan par kheni malate middle skool ke fursatiya headmaster ne vaktavy jari kiya- ‘chalo yah to acha hua
 Now the days of this puddle have become rough, this chatty will increase a bit
 
 
 
 This rock has also been recorded in history
 
 
 
 This work was to be done due to Shobhit Thakur
 jaise bhi ho rahaa he, acha ho rahaa he
 
 
 
 ’‘sahi baat he
 
 
 
 bhai, sadak or building to har koi banavaane kii baat karata he
 Very few people worry about the historical places like pokhar-talab, Temple
 
 
 
 Shobhit Thakur thought, this is a big deal
 
 
 
 'A master ji gave a shout
 ‘acha he, shobhit thakur jaise netaa ho jaaen is ilaake main to ilaake kaa kaaphi sudhaar ho jayega
 
 
 
 pehle to yahaan kaa koi netaa tha hi nahin
 For years, outside leaders used to come here and fight for the legislative and parliamentary elections, winning and becoming ministers and then forgetting this area
 
 
 
 Now boys like Shobhit Thakur are coming into politics, doing something for their area
 
 
 
 'the village head of the neighboring village took the matter forward
 itane main adhapur inter college se ritair bhugol ke adhyaaapak narsingh yadav ne jayanath kii dukaan ke aage fatfatia roki or utar kar fursatiya samooh main shaamil ho gaye
 The headmaster of the middle school raised the question on seeing him - "have you seen today's newspaper, Matsab?" "what?" The demand for saving this pokhara as a historical heritage and its restoration has arisen ?
 
 
 aapke kya vichaar hai is par?’‘haa, samachar to subah hi pard liya
 i ask for a newspaper at home 
 
 
 it's a good thing
 agar pokhare ko aitihaasik dharohar maan liya jaataa he, to yah ham sabake liye garv kii baat hogi
 
 
 
 par mujhe shaq he ki aisa hoga
 He has a long process
 
 
 
 It is a big deal even if it gets renovated
 
 
 
 'matsab of geography responded very coldly
 ‘magar ise aitihaasik dharohar maanane main kya dikkat he?’ ek navhe ne jigyaasa prakat kii
 'brother, something will be a bit of a historical heritage by us - you say it
 pehle puraatatva vibhaag ke log jaanchenge ki vastav main yah aitihaasik he yaa nahin, phir ise aitihaasik ghoshit kiya jayega
 
 
 
 agar sachmuch ise aitihaasik sthal ghoshit kar diya gaya, to samajhie is chatti ke bhaag jaag gaye
 Tourists will start coming here
 
 
 
 The importance of the temple will increase, so people will come from far and wide
 
 
 
 So, understand that part of this chatti woke up
 
 
 
 'master ji's words like cold water poured into boiling tea
 ab vicitra kism kii khichdi pakani shuru ho gai thi
 Some people had started keeping the expectations of Master Saheb and keeping their hopes and wishes in mind that Pokhara and the temple should somehow be considered as a historical heritage, so that part of this area would be awakened
 hamaare liye rojgaar ke kuch avasar khulen
 But on the other hand, after reading this news in the mind of some people, the balloon which was bloated some time ago, there was a fine hole in it
 iske alaava teesri kism ke log bhi the, jo bahut padhe-likhe nahin the
 Those who lived in farming and ethos were testing the historicity of the pond in their own way
 uske jirnoddhar ke samachar se alag tarah kii ummiden paal rahe the
 Someone would cite the stories of his grandfather and great-grandfather that the pond was built earlier, but his ghats were built anew by Rajbali Rai's great-grandfather
 koi kahata, i nae-nae netaa paidaa hue hai, inhen apane baap-daadon ke bare main to thik se pataa nahin, chale hai chandragupta maury kaa itihaas bakhaanne
 
 
 
 jhooth-mooth main hauvva khadaa karte rahete hai
 
 
 
 magar ummiido main ubh-chubh hote ek navhe ne kaaphi manthan ke baad kisi param gyani kii tarah sant bhav se vaktavy diya- ‘bekaar main log ashankaayen jataa rahe hai
 
 
 
 are puraatatva vibhaag sarkaar se baahar he kya?
 
 
 He also does not work under the government, in that also we do not work like you
 
 
 
 If the government says, the archeology department will refuse to consider Pokhara as Mauryan era? 
 
 ise rajbali raay ke naam kar degaa
 
 
 
 are jab videshi itihaaskaar kah rahe hai, to puraatatva vibhaag unki baat maanegaa ki yahaan ke adhakapari logon kii

 ’phir murjhaa rahe sapanom par jaise barish kii phuhaar pad gai
 For almost a month after the news was published, similar things - things cutting, things making new things together, hopes arousing, disappointing things, ran from all the shops in Chatti to the villages
 phir ek din unheen akhabaaron ke sthaneey sanskarnon main mukhaprishth par ek choti-si khabar chhapi- ‘dahacor pokhare ke jirnoddhar ko mili manjuuri, aitihaasik sthal kaa darja dene par puraatatva vibhaag karegaa vichaar
 Then the expectations started hurting
 navhon ke phone phir ghanaghnane lage
 The gathering on Chatti was much more today
 gaanv-gaanv se navhe motorcycle liye chale aa rahe the
 The teenager had fallen short of betel leaves at the Panwadi shop, so he drove his son to the city to fetch the leaves
 ek navhe ne shobhit thakur ke agal-bagal chalane vaale ek navhe ko phone lagaaya- ‘are bhaiya, kya program he adhyaksh ji kaa?
 
 
 When will we reach Chatti? 
 
 aaie aaie, yahaan adhyakshaji kaa ek chota-sa bhaashan karaayenge

 Let us prepare
 
 
 
 'then he switched off the phone and addressed the three-four nine-' Hey brother, the president is reaching in fifteen-twenty minutes
 fatafat dukaanon se chowkiyaan uthaao or lagaao idhar
 
 
 
 ’ usne jayanath kii dukaan ke saamne khaali jagah kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha
 Then ran to the gardener's gardener giving flowers to the shop on a ninth - 'quickly bring two or four male and some flowers
 ’ jeb se nikaal kar kuch paise use pakadaae or kaha- ‘kam pade to apni taraf se laga lenaa, nahin to mali se kahana, maine bheja he, baad main hisaab kar lenge
 
 
 
 ’navhe sakriy hue
 First of all, he picked up the people sitting at the checkpoints of Jaynath's shop and lifted the posts
 phir duusari dukaanon se chowkiyaan laakar unhen ek ke upar ek rakh kar ek chota-sa manch taiyaar kar diya
 About half an hour later, Shobhit Thakur arrived with a convoy of nine children riding on ten-twelve motorcycles
 pahunchate hi agali motorcycle par savaar navhe ne bhujaa uthaa kar naaraa lagaaya- ‘shobhit thakur jindabad
 
 
 'so the entire chatti resonated with the slogan of Zindabad
 ‘hamaara netaa kaisaa ho
 
 
 "shobhit Thakur
" 
 
 ’ ‘har har har
 
 
 ' 'shiva
 
 
 ’ paanch-saat minute tak naare goonjte rahe
 Shobhit Thakur kept smiling with folded hands and climbed on the platform connecting the posts
 jis yuvak ne is ounchak jansabha kaa aayojan kiya tha, usne upar chadh kar shobhit thakur ko maala pahanaaya, manch ke neeche se navhon ne phool phenke
 Then the organizer of the public meeting, Navheh gave a brief speech with enthusiasm - 'it is a matter of pride for us that the untiring efforts of our beloved leader, Honorable Shobhit Thakur ji, are going to be revived on this day
 gadahi ban chuke pokhare ke jirnoddhar kii manjuuri mili he or is ilaake main vikaas kii nai tasviir ubharne vaali he
 On behalf of all of you, i thank the honorable Shobhit Thakur

 i congratulate you 
 
 
 'once again he raised the slogan-' Shobhit Thakur Zindabad
 
 
 ’ or ek baar phir chatti naaron se gunj uthi
 After that, Shobhit Thakur proudly gave a speech - 'your blessings and affection is the effect that i was able to do this work
 meraa prayaas he is chatti or is puure ilaake kaa vikaas ho
 This my first attempt has been successful, due to which a historical heritage is about to get new life
 
 
 
 Pokhare renovation has been approved yet, but i assure you that very soon it will also get the status of historical heritage from the Archaeological Department
 
 
 
 Then this place will make its mark on the world map
 
 
 
 And if small mouth does not seem like a big deal, then i assure you that one day i will also include it in the list of World Heritage of the United Nations
 
 
 
 Travelers from all over the world will come here

 After six days, the movement of people towards Pokhara had increased
 sab apane-apane dhang se pokhare ko dekhte or sabake paas uske jirnoddhar ko lekar apane vichaar the, sabake man main koi na koi ruparekha thi
 Throughout the day, discussions started about the development of Chatti and the contracts for digging and cleaning of pokhar, etc
 jayanath kii dukaan par baithe ek fursatiya navhe ne vaktavy diya- ‘jainath bhaiya bhale shobhit thakur ke virdohi hon, par unke prayaason kaa sabase zyada phayda inhen ko milane vaala he
 His shop is close to Pokhara, so his shop is going to be the brightest
 
 
 
 Now instead of selling gram-dumplings-tea, they will also start selling chole-bhature, Choumin, Rasmalai, etc
 
 
 
 So brother, drink as many days as they are getting tea, otherwise they will stop making tea soon
 
 
 
 Sayed 'noah'
 phir sapane boe jane lage
 But Jayanath did not respond
 isliye koi yah nahin samaj paaya ki vah pokhare ke jirnoddhar or chatti ke vikaas kii khabar se khush he yaa nahin
 Annoyed, everyone once again declared him a buck and turned the matter to another side
 aise hi chakallas bhare dinon main ek din teen-chaar logon ke saath tehseeldaar sahab aae
 The gunman also brought two soldiers
 ve jeep se utre or sabase pehle pokhare kii taraf gaye
 He took stock of the pokhara, temple and well and sat down at Jayanath's shop
 apane maatahat karmchaaree ko kaha to usne chaowkee par nakshaa failaa diya
 Jayanath was busy making tea for him without saying
 nakshaa dekhne ke baad tehseeldaar sahab uthe or sadak ke kinare khadey hokar pokhare kii taraf sadak par khadi dukaanon kii taraf gaur se dekhne lage
 The subordinate staff and soldiers also stood beside him
 chatti kii tamaam dukaanon par baithe gapiyate fursatiya bhi dhire-dhire jute aae the
 Meanwhile, Jayanath brought tea and a glass was held in the hands of all the employees including the Tehsildar Saheb
 ve kuch der khadey-khadey nakshe par kuch nishaan lagaate rahe
 Some enthusiastic and curious master and novices of the crowd gathered around, glanced at the map and tried to understand what they were planning, but the soldiers shied away at them
 sabane chaay pi or nakshaa lapet kar jeep main ja dhanse
 Jeep turned on and left
 kisi ko pataa nahin chalaa ki tehseeldaar sahab ne nakshe par kya nishandehi kii, kya yojana banaai
 But everyone kept throwing different kinds of things with their speculations
 khayr, tehseeldaar sahab ke aakar chale jane ke baad logon ko yakeen ho gaya tha ki jaldi hi kaam shuru ho jayega
 After three or four days, the policeman came from the police station
 saath main chaar-paanch sipaahi bhi the
 They got out of the jeep and stood in front of Jayanath's shop and spread the map on the bonnet of the jeep
 is baar jayanath kaa dil jor-jor se dhadak rahaa tha, par bina kahe usne unke liye bhatthi par chaay chadha di
 After removing the sight from the map, Daroga ji got straight and asked the soldiers to call all the shopkeepers
 bulaane kii jarurat nahin padi, zyaadaatar dukandaar aasapaas hi jamaa ho gaye the, so daaroga ji ke paas simat aa gaye
 Jayanath too came with tea and after holding the glasses in everyone's hand, stood up with his hands tied
 daaroga ji ne ghoshnaa kii- ‘dekho bhai, aap logon ko to pataa he ki shashan ne is jagah par vikaas kaary kii manjuuri di he
 There is a plan for renovation of Pokhara
 is yojana ke mutabik pokhare se lekar is sadak tak sari jagah khaali kerani padegi
 Since all the shops here are standing on the land of village society, this place has been declared as official
 yahaan ab koi dukaan nahin rahegi
 All of you should remove your shops from here within a week
 
 
 
 i do not have to come again
 
 
 
 i am sure that you guys will not give me any chance of strictness
 
 
 
 Then he filled the last sip of tea, grabbed the glass in Jayanath's hand and proceeded to the front seat of the jeep
 sipaahi bhi jeep main baith gaye or jeep laut gai
 Now a new type of phlegm started
 sabane pokhare kii taraf kii sadak ke kinare bani dukaanon par najar daudani shuru kii
 Most of the shops were in Gumti, some were thatched, so it was not difficult to remove them
 par unamem ek dukaan thi, jo eent-gaare se bani thi
 He had no choice but to break it
 vah dukaan thi jayanath kii
 
 
 
 vah mahaj dukaan nahin thi, jayanath kii rihaaish bhi thi
 His entire family lived in it
 thi bhi pokhare ke bilkul paas
 So he could not be saved from breaking up in any way
 daaroga ji gaye, to jayanath kii dukaan par maayusi pasar gai
 In the meantime, some Khairakwah Navhey gave the opinion- 'if Jainath Bhaiya meets Shobhit Thakur once, this shop can avoid being broken
 
 
 
 ''now nothing can be done
 sara nakshaa taiyaar ho chukaa he
 
 
 
 shobhit thakur kya nakshaa badalawa denge?
 
 
 'A master ji responded
 ‘kyon nahin, ve netaa hai bhai, chahen to kuch bhi kara sakate hai
 'navah stood by his opinion
 magar jayanath chup hi rahaa
 a mixed sense of anger, frustration, defeat, helplessness was visible on his face
 vah puraa din aise hi maayusi main gujara
 000 In the evening when darkness was deepening, the young village head of Madhopur stopped the motorcycle in front of Jayanath's shop and went to Jayanath
 us vakt dukaan par ek-do graahak hi baithe the
 Jayanath's wife was cooking food for the family at the furnace
 gram pradhan ne apana munh jayanath ke kaan ke paas le jaakar fusfusaate hue bataaya- ‘main jila mukhyalay se aa rahaa hum
 a big trusted officer has told that on this side all the land along the roadside is being given to Shobhit Thakur on a hundred year lease for one rupee
 ve yahaan dukaane banavaayenge or unhen kiraye par chadhayenge
 The village head was smelling strong, but Jayanath tolerated it
 koi or din hota to vah gram pradhan ko fatkaar lagaataa, magar aaj usne aisa nahin kiya
 He listened to the village headman, but did not react

 indira gandhi ne 25 june 1975 ko desh main apatkaal kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 But after 21 months, Indira Gandhi was forced to remove it

 Indira Gandhi was advised by the then Chief Minister of Bengal, Siddharth Shankar Ray on 8 January 1975, to impose an emergency in the country

 Addressing the Dictionary for the Future session, Futurist Mike Walsh said that companies would need new leaders with new skills
 tumaaro ke siio mike walsh ne 'futuretenment', 'da dictionari of dangeras idiaj' jaisi kai kitaaben likhi hai
 He gave his views on how to preserve our existence in the new world, the world of Algarism
 unke teen pramukh vichaar is prakaar hai-1
 Upgrading the operating system in a business should be part of its culture
 companiyon ko taaje or alag tarah ke soch ke logon kii jarurat he-aise log jo jatil halaat main bhi achche nirnay le saken, jo log duniya ko badalte swaroop main hi sweekaar kar saken
 The best people of an organization will do such things in the future which do not exist today
 iske saath hi sadachaar companiyon kii samskruti kaa hissaa hona chahie
 Companies cannot tolerate incidents such as data culture or data theft
 2
 Develop leadership that has a deep understanding of human complexity and computational techniques
 walsh ne is tarah ke leaders ko 'algaridamik leaders' naam diya he
 Such leaders should have the ability to divide a problem into small pieces and find a solution
 3
 Bringing value to business is not just about automation
 asal vailu data he
 Companies should create a culture in which data based decisions can be taken
 walsh ko lagata he ki companiyon ke paas yadi data or upyukt samskruti ho to kisi kaarobaar ko bhavishya main nayaa swaroop dena aasaan hoga
 a good start for this might be that a brainstorming session on data is conducted every week and people are asked to give ideas about what might be the best possible use for the data
