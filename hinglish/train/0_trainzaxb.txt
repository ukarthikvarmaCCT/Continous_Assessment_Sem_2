 kareeb 50 varshon ke baad dakshin bhartiya rajyon se ek baar phir se alag dravidanadu kii maang uthne lagi he
 Within India, some leaders are talking about creating a separate Dravidanadu i
e
 the five southern states, while some leaders are demanding separation from India
 dakshin bhartiya netaaon kaa kahana he ki dakshin ke rajyon ko uttar bhartiya rajyon ke mukaable bharat sarkaar kii taraf se kam mahatv or sahuliyatein milti hai
 Due to which the South Indian states are suffering
 samay-samay par dravidanadu kii maang uthati rahi he, lekin is baar yah maang uthaai he abhinayta se netaa bane camel hasan ne, jinhone haal hi main apni ek rajnatik party makkal nidhi mayyam banaai he
 He aspires to expand his party to Tamil Nadu as well as other states in the south
 unki is maang kaa samarthan kiya he dramuk netaa emke stallin ne, jo khud bhi dakshin ke sabase bade rajya tamilnadu main apni khoi siyaasi jameen talashne main lage hai
 These two leaders say that if all the states of the south demand Dravidanadu together then their voice will get stronger
 telegu filmon ke abhinayta or jansena party ke netaa pawan kalyaan ne to is prakaar kii maang ko jaij tehraate hue united stats of sadarn india kaa naam bhi suza diya he
 TDP MP Murali Mohan even went on to say that if similar discriminations continue between the southern states, the five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala will together declare themselves independent
 darasal dravidanadu kii maang to 1940 se hi kii ja rahi he
 In 1940, the Justice Party of Periyar also passed a resolution regarding this demand
 is prastaav main dravid logon ke liye alag desh kii maang kii gai thi
 This demand was further accentuated in the 1940s to 1960s, when Periyar's former aide CN Annadurai said in Parliament in May 1962 that the time had come for Tamil Nadu (erstwhile Madras) to be given the status of a separate country and the South a separate country called Dravidanadu should be formed by combining the states of iske peeche unhone tark diya ki dakshin kaa parivesh bharat ke baaki hisson se bhinn he
 In Parliament, Jana Sangh leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee strongly opposed this issue of Annadurai saying that such demand is unreasonable after 15 years of independence
 vaajapeyi kii baat kaa sansad main adhikansh sadasyon ne samarthan bhi kiya tha
 The controversy over the Hindi language in the 60s also added to this demand, according to the famous writer Ramchandra Guha, the then Prime Minister Pt
 jawaharlal nehru kii samajhadaari tathaa angreji ko lekar unki soch ke kaaran yah desh bikharane se batch gaya tha
 This time, this dissatisfaction is with the allocation of finance to the 15th Finance Commission
 darasal ab tak 1971 kii jansankhya ke aadhaar par rajyon ko vitt aavanton hota rahaa he, lekin is baar 2011 kii jansankhya ke anusaar rajyon ko vitt aavantit karne kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 According to a report by the Economic and Political Weekly based on the report of the 14th Finance Commission, Andhra Pradesh received about 24,000 crore rupees during the year 2015-20 due to using the 2011 census instead of 1971
 ke, tamilnadu ko 22,000 karod ru
 Over Rs, 20,000 crore to Kerala
 se adhik or karnataka ko lagbhag 8,500 karod ru
 Will have to suffer loss of 2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik vitt aavanton hone se iskaa laabh uttar pradesh, bihar, rajasthan, empi or jammu-kashmir sareekhe rajyon ko hoga
 This is why leaders of South Indian states are raising such demands

 havers ke liye ye sibar atake pehle step ke taur par bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Generally in hacking it happens that in the first step, hackers target a computer or device that is not very important
 kyonki shuruyaat main kaaphi basic jaankariyaan ikaitha karnaa inkaa makasad hota he
 Initially, the Nuclear Corporation of India called this news wrong and said that cyber attack has not happened and it is not possible
 pehle kiya manaa, baad main NPCIL ne mana kiya hua he sibar atacolekin iske baad newclear power korporation of india ne yah mana kii sibar atake hua he
 The statement stated
 'NPCIL ke system main mailaware paae jane kii khabar sahi he
 The CERT notices this on 4 September 2019 and has been informed that the 'department of Atomic Energy immediately started an investigation and found that the affected computer belonged to a user who was connected to the Internet and was for administrative purposes
 ye computer critical network system se judaa nahin tha
 Significantly, the critical computers used in the nuclear facility, which are part of the critical network, are not connected to any external network or the Internet, so as to avoid the dangers of hacking or cyber attack
 kudankulam newclear plant main sibar atake ke bare main pukhraj singh ne twit kiya tha
 Pukhraj is a cyber security expert who has worked for India's technical intelligence agency NTRO (national Technical Research Organization)
 twitor par unhone is hekking ke bare main jaankariyaan share kii hai
 According to cyber security researcher Pukhraj, a malware attack has been carried out at a nuclear power plant that can access the domain level controller of the nuclear facility
 inhone hi is mailaware ke bare main bataaya ki ye Dtrack he
 According to the report, Malware called Dtrack is used by North Korea
 ise Lazaru Group ne taiyaar kiya he or ye north korea state spai agency ke liye kaam karata he
 What does Dtrack malware do? According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, Drack is a remote access trojan, also known as RAT
 ise torget computers main khatarnaak modul install karne ke liye yuj kiya jaataa he
 These include keylogger and browser history theft tools
 iske alaava is mailaware ke jariye havers kisi computer se ypi adress sahit us computer se jude hue duusare active network conection kaa data hasil kar sakate hai
 Like we said earlier, hackers collect a lot of basic information in the beginning and this malware is the only tool to collect basic information
 is milavayer ke jariye hajaaron lakhon kilometre dur baithe havers torget computer main kisi tarah kaa khatarnaak software chalaa sakate hai, data aplod kar sakate hai iske saath ched chhaad kar sakate hai
 The Indian banking system was targeted a few years ago with dtrack
 sarkaar ne ab tak is bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha he – jaise is sibar atake ke liye koun jimmedaar he, kis tarah kaa atake tha
 So much has been said that it was not serious and it was investigated and now all is well
 Dtrack ko targated sibar atake ke liye pehle step ke taur par bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 This question is also important that if Pukhraj Singh is pointing to which North Korea link is, then this cyber attack can definitely be serious
 kyonki sibar atex duniya bhar ke liye bade chanlange kii tarah hai bharat main sibar atex teji se bad rahe hai

 Diamond jewelery should be well maintained and cleaned with a soft toothbrush
 'dilaano lakjurious jwels privet limited' ke sansthaapak va lead diziner chitwan di
 Malhotra and jewelery designer Pooja Juneja have made these suggestions regarding the care of diamond jewelery
 - apane aabhushan ko paded (gaddidaar yaa astr lage) box main rakhen
 Not doing this can cause scratch marks on the diamond
 lambey arse tak heere ke aabhushanon ko surakshit rakhane ke liye har aabhushan ko alag-alag paded box main rakhen
 If opal and pearls are also studded with diamonds in your jewelery, then do not keep it in a very dry place or dark place for a long time, because this gem may lose its shine
 julari box ko nami vaali jagah par bhi nahin rakhen
 - Always clean the jewelery with a soft toothbrush
 aabhushan ko clining solution se nikaalkar heere ke aasapaas halke haathon se brush se saaf karen
 Regular cleaning maintains the sparkle of the diamond
 baking soda yaa toothpaste se aabhushan ko saaf karne se bachein
 Clean it with lukewarm water using a gentle liquid soap
 chaahe to hanikaarak chemical rahit va moishcharizer rahit hand sope kaa bhi istemaal kar sakati hai
 You can keep your diamond jewelery immersed in the same amount of water and ammonia for 30 minutes, then wash it and wipe it thoroughly with a clean, soft cotton cloth
 - heere ke aabhushan ko dhardaar, nukili, yaa paini (sharp) chizon se dur rakhen, agar aap ise kisi anya sharp julari ke paas rakhti hai yaa dhaatu ke box main rakhti hai, to isaki sataha par kharonch ke nishaan pad sakate hai or chamak kho sakati he
 - Take a diamond ornament and take a bath
 pani main maujuud chlorine isaki chamak feeki kar saktaa he
 In this way, spend the summer holidays, will last a lifetime
 Remember - wear diamond ornament only after using perfume or hairspray, because the chemical present in it can fade its complexion
 - vyaayaam aadi karne ke dauraan aabhushan pahanane se bachein kyonki is dauraan pasinaa nikalataa he or kuch aabhushan khaskar kritrim moti ke aabhushan rangahin ho sakate hai
 These dangerous viruses are spreading rapidly in India - take your diamond jewelery twice a year to a professional jeweler for regular checkup
 ve is baat kii acchhee tarah se jaanch kar sakenge ki ye acchhee shape main hai yaa nahin or isse pehle koi badi tut-foot ho, pehle hi kisi tarah ke chote-mote nuksaan hone par repere kar denge, jisase aapako apane keemtee aabhushan ko khone kaa dar nahin rahegaa

 Many analysts monitoring China's affairs said that the responsibility of looking into such subjects usually rests with junior level officials

 Many Chinese experts believe that as far as China's interests in Pakistan are concerned, especially regarding the terrorists of the East Turkistan Islamic Republic Movement, this policy of China has been effective, of course, on behalf of Pakistan's anti-india terrorist operations Has kept his eyes closed

 com / vzmi35kgvo— Kartik's Forever ! 😊 (@ishivofficial)march 17, 2018 The controversial statements of Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi in Bihar continued to make headlines in the year 2014
 is kaaran unhen apni party janata dal-united (JDU) ke varisht netaaon kii naseehaten bhi sunani padi
 Girls were attracted to Manjhi in college life
 Senior JDU leader Nitish Kumar, who is considered to be an expert in social engineering in politics, resigned from the post of Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, taking moral responsibility after the party's debacle in the Lok Sabha elections
 He was made the chief minister, but Manjhi's many statements made the party in trouble many times
 is varsh 20 may ko bihar ke mukhyamantri ke pad par virajman hone ke baad vipakshi dalon ne maanjhi ko 'khadaau mukhyamantri' kaa visheshan diya tha
 While Bihar's politics continued to heat up due to Manjhi's consistently controversial statements, legislators considered supporters of former Chief Minister Nitish also demanded the party leadership to resign from Manjhi on several occasions
 maanjhi ne apane grih jile gaya main 12 agast ko yojit ek kaarykram main nitish kii bhrashtachar ke khilaaf 'jiro tolerance' niti ke daawey kii dhajjiyaan udaate hue kaha ki nitish sarkaar main rajya kaa vikaas bhale hi hua ho, lekin bhrashtachar tab bhi kam nahin hua tha
 Manjhi believes in cleanliness
 us samay unhone yahaan tak kah diya tha ki unhone khud bijli vibhaag ke bill ko kam karaane ke liye rishwat di thi
 On the news that the people affected by the floods in Bihar were alive by eating a mouse, Chief Minister Manjhi had given a peculiar statement and heated the politics of entire Bihar
 unhone kaha tha ki chuha markar khaanaa kharaab baat nahin he
 Manjhi said that he himself used to eat rats
 iske purv bhi maanjhi ne daliton or pichhadi jatiyon ke ladakon ko antarjaatiy vivaah karne kii naseehat dete hue jansankhya badhaane kii baat kahi thi
 There was a lot of controversy over all these statements, after which JDU leaders had to come forward to clarify
 maanjhi ne is dauraan bihar ke kendriya mantriyon ko bihar main nahin ghusane dene kii chetavanee bhi di thi
 State politics was also heated by this statement
 unhone kaha tha, 'agar ve bihar ke vikaas main madad nahin kar paae to unhen bihar main ghusane nahin denge
 They all stay in Delhi
 'is varsh 17 oktober ko maanjhi ne motihaari main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue chikitsakon ke 'haath kaat dene' jaisi chetavanee de di thi
 However, after the displeasure of the doctors' association, he had spoken of using this statement as an idiom
 iske purv patna main patrakaron se charchaa karte hue 13 oktober ko unhone achche swasthya or bal kuposhan ko dur karne ke liye vivaah kii umr 25 varsh karne kii salaah di thi
 Apart from all these, Manjhi was targeted by the leaders and opposition of his own parties due to his many controversial statements

 This threat of 'precautionary nuclear attack for justice' has been given by the powerful National Defense Commission of North Korea in a statement to the highest command of the Korean People's Army

 Rahul Dravid once felt scared of ending his career due to poor form but he took inspiration from fellow great batsman Sachin Tendulkar's combative ability and not only brought his career back on track but also scored the most Test runs in the current season
 The batsmen were also
 dravid ne khulaasa kiya ki lambey samay tak kharaab farm main kaaran unhen laga ki unka karier khatm ho gaya he or is dauraan unhone apane upar kaaphi dabaav bana liya tathaa sochane laga ki khel ko alavida kehane kaa sarvshereshth samay koun sa hoga
 But he changed himself by focusing on how Tendulkar dealt with such a difficult time
 chaar saal pehle bharat ke pichley austrailia daure ke baad ke samay ko yaad karte hue dravid ne sidney marning herald se kaha, ‘maine sochaa ki main austrailia main apana antim test khel chukaa hum
 If you are a player who has contributed a lot to your team over the years, then it is not normal to feel that the team is carrying you
 mere liye yah mushkil samay tha
 Dravid did not perform well on home tours against Australia and England after that but he was not dropped from the team and eventually managed to regain his old form
 daayen haath ke is ballebaaj ne kaha ki farm main vaapasi ke liye unhen tendulkar se prerana mili jo khud kai baar jazbe ke saath mushkil samay se paar paane main safal rahe
 He said, 'he went through difficult times and came out of it
 yah mere liye prerana tha
 i was in the dressing room with him and when i was going through one of my worst times, he was in excellent form
 ’dravid ne kaha, ‘aap sochate hai ki agar vah kar saktaa he
 
 beshak vah kahin behatar khilaadi he, ek mahaan khilaadi lekin vah bahari chizon ke liye apane upar dabaav nahin daalata, vah sanyas ke bare main kaaphi sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin detaa, vah sirf ran banane ke apane kaam main juta rahata he

 pakistan kaa ek tark yah bhi he ki uskaa bharat ke saath ek qaraar he jisamen jasusi ke aarope main giraftaar vyakti ko consular acces dene kaa praavdhaan nahin he

 In the last hearing, the ICJ barred Pakistan from taking any action against Jadhav
 court kaa kahana he ki is maamle main jabatak antim faisla nahin aa jaataa, pakistan jadhav ke khilaaf koi kadam nahin uthayega

 The police arrested several accused in the case and recovered the remaining three abducted youths
 poochtacha ke dauraan aropiyon ne khulaasa kiya ki vidhayak ne chaaron yuvakon ko sabak sikhaane kaa aadesh diya tha, lekin ve baaki yuvakon ko maarthe isse pehle hi police vahaan pahunch gai
 Nitish took the support of Anant to win the election 2005 The government of this 'don' of Mokama, who won the election for the first time, runs a different government
 uske khilaaf kai aapraadhik maamle bhi saamne aae lekin sarkaar ke dabaav ke chalate police uske khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kar saki
 While contesting against Lalu Prasad Yadav in 2005, Nitish promised to free Bihar from criminals but resorted to Anant to win the election

 saal 2013 main anant singh par patna ke posh patliputra colony sthit apane hotel ke saamne atikaraman karne kaa aarope bhi lag chukaa he
 However, when the uproar broke out, Bahubali vacated the land
 dilachasp baat yah he ki apnidabang chhavi se aatank paidaa karne valeor logon ko jhukne par majaboor karne vaale anant singh ko apni party kii hi ek vidhayak or samaaj kalyaan mantri parveen amanulla kii vajah se peeche hatane ko majaboor hona padaa tha
 RTI activist-turned-minister Parveen Amanullah arrived in front of Anant Singh's hotel without any security and instructed the hotel authorities to immediately remove the encroachment
 vidhayak banane ke saath hi bad gai sampattividhayak banane ke paanch saal baad hi anant singh kii sampatti kai guna bad gai he
 In 2005, Anant Singh in his election affidavit 3

 Anant Singh said that i had made this Baggi for myself in Delhi, i ordered it home a few years ago
 iske baad se lagaataar main ghoda-buggi chalaata rahata hum kyonki isamen petrol kii jarurat nahin hoti
 Former CM Manjhi has also made serious allegations: Former Bihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi also made serious allegations against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and said that he is plotting to kill my Bahubali MLA Anant Singh
 mukhyamantri pad se hatane par majaboor kiye jane ke baad maanjhi ne kaha, 'bihar sarkaar aparaadhiyon ko khub tavajjo de rahi he
 Nitish Kumar and Bahubali make a lot in Anant Singh

 At the behest of Nitish, Anant Singh may kill me

 Apart from this, the vehicle was also sought as dowry
 police ne cese darj kar jaanch shuru kar di he
 The boy's absurd demand was to be married on May 14 in a village in Amroha
 tent lag gaye the, khaanaa taiyaar ho rahaa tha
 The goods were furnished to be given in dowry but a wild demand dissolved in color
 thak-harkar ladki waalon ne police ko phone kiya
 a lawsuit has been filed for dowry demands
 meet ke saath bolero gaadi kii magaldki ke parivaar kaa aarope he ki ladke waalon ne achaanak bhens kamit parose jane kii mangarakh di
 Mustafa, the father of the groom Wasim, who was on the phone, said that the procession will not go until meat is eaten
 dulhan paksh kaa ye bhi aarope he ki ladke waalon ne dahej main bolero gaadi kii bhi baari bharkam demand rakh di
 The whole matter was told by the boys
 After this whole issue, the boy is currently absconding

 tillakaratne dilashaan ke aatishi shatak ke baad gendbaajon ke damdaar pradarshan ke dam par srilanka ne shanivaar ko yahaan trikoniya ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa ke final main bharat ko aasaani se 74 ran se haraa diya
 Sri Lanka made a strong score of 299 for eight with the help of Dilshan's 110-run innings, in response to which Team India 46
 5 main 225 ran par hi dher ho gai
 For the hosts, Tishara Perera took 36 wickets while Suraj Randiv took 3-3 wickets for 40 runs
 srilanka ne iske saath hi lagbhag do maheene pehle isi maidan par bharat ke haathon asia cap final kii haar kaa badla bhi chuktaa kar liya
 Apart from playing a century, Dilshan shared a 121-run first wicket stand with Mahela Jayawardene (39) and an 85-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara (71)
 bhartiya team shuru se hi srilanka ke vishaal score ke dabaav main dikhi or captain mahendra singh dhoni (67) or viraat kohli (37) kii upyogi pariyon ke baavjood lakshya se kaaphi peeche rahi
 Some of India's batsmen got off to a good start but failed to convert it into big innings
 bharat kii shuruuaat kaaphi kharaab rahi or usne pehle over main hi kharaab farm se jujh rahe dinesh karthik kaa wicket ganvaa diya jo ek baar phir khaataa kholane main vifal rahe
 He was caught by Lasith Malinga at the hands of wicketkeeper Sangakkara
 virendra sahvaag (28) ne nuwan kulshekhara par lagaataar do chauke jadkar apane tevar dikhaaye lekin chathe over main vah ran out ho gayi
 Kulasekara's direct ball hit his pads, on which the bowler appealed for a lbw, which the umpire denied
 sahvaag is bich aage bad gayi or unke krij par lautne se pehle kulshekhara ne unhen ran out kar diya
 At this time India's score was 38 runs for two wickets
 captain dhoni ne iske baad suresh raina (29) ke saath 49 ran jode
 Raina adopted an aggressive attitude from the beginning
 unhone aate kii perera par chakka jadaa jabaki suraj randiv kii gend ko bhi chah ran ke liye bheja
 Randiv, however, ended his innings by getting him caught by Dilshan
 rohit sharma (05) ek baar phir vifal rahe or randiv kii gend par stan hokar pavilion laute jisase bharat kaa score chah wicket par 177 ran ho gaya
 Malinga then bowled Praveen Kumar (14) to give India a seventh blow
 dhoni ne kulshekhara kii gend ko long aan par ek ran ke liye khelkar 67 gend main apana 37waan ardhashatak puraa kiya lekin unhen duusare chor se saath nahin mila
 India needed 96 runs to win in the last 10 overs, which was a difficult target
 perera ne iske baad ishanth sharma ko bold kiya jo 12 gend main khaataa bhi nahin khol paye
 Dhoni continued to try in the meantime but Sri Lanka were finding it difficult to score runs ahead of the exact bowling which was only 17 runs in between 41 and 45 overs
 maithyuj ne iske baad ashish nehra (02) ko perera ke haathon kaich karaayaa jabaki randiv ne dhoni ko bold karke bharat kii pari kaa ant kiya
 He hit five fours and a six in his 100-ball innings
 ishanth sharma ne jayavardhane ko dinesh karthik ke haathon kaich karakar bharat ko pehali safalataa dilaai
 Jayawardene earlier became the third Sri Lankan cricketer to complete 9000 runs in ODI cricket
 kaamchalau spinner yuvaraj ne upul tharanga (06) ko dhoni ke haathon kaich karaayaa
 After losing two quick wickets, Dilshan and captain Sangakkara finished the innings of Sri Lanka
 donon ne ek or do ran ke saath scoreboard ko gatiman rakhaa jabaki kharaab gendon ko naseehat bhi di
 Indian bowlers were having difficulty putting the brakes on the rung
 team ko paanchaven visheshgy gendbaaj kii kami bhi khali
 Dilshan meanwhile completed his eighth century with two runs off Ishant's ball and his third century against India, which is also his first century on Sri Lankan soil
 dilashaan haalanki iske baad adhik der nahin tik sake
 Praveen catches him on the boundary at the hands of Ishant
 unhone 115 gend kii apni pari main 12 chauke or ek chakka jadaa
 Munaf Patel then caught Sangakkara in the hands of Rohit Sharma while Ashish Nehra reduced the run pace by sending Chamara Kapugedara (12) to the pavilion but the innings saw Sri Lanka's team score 300 runs with plenty of Noble, Wide and Tabatur batting in the final overs
 Reached close to mejabaan team ne antim 10 over main 80 ran jode
 The political upheaval in Karnataka in the last three days has made headlines across the country
 congress or janata dal secular (JDS) kii gathbandhan sarkaar par sankat ke badal mandara rahe hai, to vahiin mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami sabakuch thik hone kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 Meanwhile, everyone's eyes are on what will happen to the 13 mlas who have resigned
 kyonki mangalvaar ko vidhansabha ke adhyaksh unki kismat par faisla lenge
 a lot has happened in Karnataka in the last two days and is likely to decrease on Tuesday as well
 aise main in 10 points main samajhen ki abhi tak kya ahm hua or kya hone ko he
 
 
 1
 congress ke 10 or JDS ke 3 vidhayakon ne apane pad se istipha diya
 After which the future of Kumaraswamy government came under threat
 ye sabhi vidhayak istipha saunp kar mumbai ravaanaa ho gaye
 2
 in 13 vidhayakon ke istife ke baad nirdaleey vidhayak nagesh ne bhi sarkaar se apana samarthan waapas le liya
 He also announced to support the BJP
 nagesh ke baad somvaar shaam tak ek anya nirdaleey vidhayak ne bhi samarthan waapas le liya
 3
 vidhayakon ke istife ke baad party ne lagaataar unhen ko manaane kii koshish kii
 But he did not agree, not only that all the ministers of the government also resigned from their posts
 pehle congress cote ke mantriyon ne istipha saunpa or baad main jedies cote ke mantriyon ne bhi pad chhod diya
 4
 congress kii ore se koshish kii ja rahi he ki sarkaar main mantrimandal main badlaav kiya jaae, naaraaz vidhayakon ko mantri bana kar waapas laane kii koshishen tej hai
 5
 naaraaz vidhayakon ko manaane ke liye congress netaa dike sivakumar ko mumbai ravaanaa kiya gaya he
 But as he left for Mumbai, all the mlas were shifted from there to Goa
 haalanki, mangalvaar subah khabar ai ki vah mumbai main hi hai
 6
 somvaar ko raksha mantri rajnath singh ne bhi is masale par loksabhaa main jawaab diya or kaha tha ki karnataka main jo ho rahaa he usase bijepi kaa koi lenaa dena nahin he
 This culture has started in the Congress since Rahul Gandhi's resignation
 7
 Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary had alleged that the BJP was doing horse trading and trying to get mlas into its fold
 bijepi ke paas 303 saansad hai, phir bhi unka pet nahin bharaa he
 His stomach has become a Kashmiri gate
 8
 Former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa's statement came on Monday that he hopes that more mlas will also resign, after which he will take a decision on his behalf
 iske saath hi vah abhi spikar ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 9
 bijepi mangalvaar ko rajya main pradarshan bhi karegi
 The resignation of Chief Minister Kumaraswamy has been sought by the BJP
 10
 The picture of the assembly is changing in the midst of the ongoing ruckus in the state
 vidhansabha main ab bijepi ke paas 107 (105+2), congress ke paas 70+34 (104) vidhayak hai
 Delhi University has received a setback from the Delhi High Court
 snaatak paathyakramon ke liye daakhila prakriya main badlaav karne main dilli uniwarsity ke faisle ko dilli hai court ne badal diya he
 The court has said that the admission process for undergraduate courses should be maintained as it was in the session 2018-19
 yani dilli uniwarsity court se aae is faisle ke baad daakhila prakriya main kiye gaye badlaavon ke hisaab se nae admician nahin kar sakegi
 Now the last date will be June 22 for the addition, in addition to this, the court has extended the online date ending today i
e
 June 14 till June 22
 court ne faisla sunaate hue kaha ki dilli uniwarsity ek din pehle badlaav kaise kar saktaa he
 Students should have given notice three months in advance
 court se aae is faisle se diu main is baar daakhila lene ke liye form bharne vaale kareeb saadhe teen lakh chaatro ko raahat milegi
 On the decision of Delhi University, the High Court said that the bench of Justice Anu Malhotra and Justice Talwant Singh told Delhi University that there is no dispute that you need to keep pace with time
 shiksha maanakon kii behatar karne se aapako koi nahin roktaa
 Your decision to amend is possible but it is probably not the right time
 bikom (onors) or bie (onors), arthshaastra sahit kai snaatak paathyakramon ke liye yogyata maandand main sanshodhan ke dilli uniwarsity ke faisle ko chunauti dene ke liye dilli hai court main janhit yachika lagaai gai thi jis par hai court ne yah faisla diya he
 Last month, Delhi University implemented this amendment on May 29, 1 day before the process of admission started
 jiske baad dilli uniwarsity main daakhila lene ke liye aae bahut saare chaatr yahaan pravesh lene se vanchit ho rahe the
 But after today's order from the court, all those millions of students have breathed a sigh of relief
 hai court ke aadesh ke baad ab nae sanshodhano ke saath dilli uniwarsity main pravesh prakriya agle satr main hi shuru ho paaegi
 Please tell that 79 colleges come under Delhi University
 daakhile ke liye form bharne vaale kareeb teen se saadhe teen lakh chaatro main se kareeb dedh lakh ko dilli uniwarsity ke alag-alag collejon main admician miltaa he yani hai court se aae is faisle kaa vyapak asar hoga
 Actor Randeep Hooda, who reacted to Virender Sehwag's tweet on a video of Gurmehar Kaur that came up for discussion after the Ramjas College controversy, has now given his clarification on the issue
 darasal soshal media kaa ek tabaka viru ke saath-saath hooda kii bhi aalochana kar rahaa he
 Actually, those who criticized Hooda say that his reaction was in favor of those trolling Gurmehar Kaur
 isse aahat randeep ne ek fasebuk post ke jariye apane dil kii baat kahi he

 Veeru had made a joke and i confess to laugh at him
 vah behad hi gudgudane vaale shaks hai or yah unki lakhon baton main se ek he jis par main hansaa tha
 It is just such a thing
 lekin ab main hairaan hum ki mujhe ek yuvati ke khilaaf nafrat bhadakaane ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya ja rahaa he
 That girl believes the same
 yah puri tarah se galat he
 We did not have this feeling at all and our tweets are no source for spreading hatred towards him
 us ladki ne ek mudde par apni raay rakhi
 She stood up for what she believes in
 so uske andar apane khilaaf baton ko sunne kaa saahas or dhairya bhi hona chahie
 In this case, it is not appropriate to raise the finger on someone else (on me in this case) and hold them responsible
 
 
 main uske khilaaf bilkul nahin hum or pukhta taur par yakeen karata hum ki hinsa galat he
 Threatening violence to a woman is a more serious crime and those who do such a thing should be punished severely

 com / hiibdaucjp Let you know that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP got 105 seats, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats
 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But Shiv Sena kept demanding 50-50 formula according to which the model of running the government was two and a half years
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken
 iske baad kai daur kii baithkon ke baad congress-ncp or shivasena ne faisla kiya ki uddhav thakare kii aguwai main sarkaar banaai jaae or shanivaar ko teenon dal rajbhavan jaakar daawa pesh karne vaale the
 But the BJP overturned Ajit Pawar in the night and CM Devendra Fadnavis took the oath at 8 am and Ajit Pawar became deputy CM

 subrahmanyam ne shanivaar ko pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo) se poocha ki vah apana istipha kise saunpe kyonki kendriya kanoon mantri virappa moili ne unka istipha lene se inkaar kar diya he
 Sources said the Prime Minister asked Subrahmanyam to wait until he discussed the issue with his cabinet colleagues
 subrahmanyam ne ravivaar ko patrakaron se kaha ki unhone 'karyaalay kii garima' banaae rakhane ke liye apane pad se istipha de diya he
 On Sibal appointing another lawyer to the Supreme Court, Subrahmanyam said, "I think it is not fair
" " sutron ne yah bhi bataaya ki subrahmanyam ne shanivaar ko bengaluru main maujuud moili se baat kii thi
 Moily, however, asked him to reconsider his resignation
 gyaat ho ki subrahmanyam ne ravivaar subah raashtrapati pratibha patil se mulaakaat kii lekin is baithak ko ek shishtachar bhent bataaya gaya
 It is reported that the relationship between Attorney General Goolam Vahanvati and Advocate General is not good

 Sibal's appointment of Rohington Nariman to present his case in the Supreme Court in the 2G scam case has been taken as an indication that an important minister of the government does not trust Subramanya
 nariman, sarvocch nyaayalay ke nyaayamurti jies singhvi or nyaayamurti ashok kumaar ganguli kii peeth ke samaksh centre for public interest litigeshan (sipiiel) dwaara daayar janhit yachika ke viruddh sibbal kaa paksh prastut karenge
