 Now the bet has turned
 musharraf jail main hai or 14 saal baad navaj sharif is haisiyat main hai, jahaan se puch saken ki bol tere saath kya suluk kiya jaae
 Mian Musharraf came to Pakistan with great armament
 ankhon main ek baar phir se pakistan kii hukumat par kabiz hone ke sapane pal rahe the lekin hukumat mil gai navaj sharif ko
 Nawaz Sharif, whose government was overthrown in 1999 by Pervez Musharraf
 sarkaar to gai hi, navaj sharif ko desh chhodkar bhi janaa padaa tha
 Now Nawaz Sharif is in the hands of Mian Musharraf, he does not even have to be found, he is in jail in the treason charges, but now what will happen next
 navaj sharif ke liye bhi aasaan nahin hoga wo dushmani bhulaanaa, jisaki neenv 14 saal pehle padi thi
 Musharraf and Nawaz's enmity began in 1999
 tab pakistan ke pradhanmantri the navaj sharif or sena kii kaman thi parvej musharif ke haath main
 Before the Kargil War, their relationship was also very good, but after the mission Kargil flopped, both of them started trying to remove each other from the post
 pakistan main roj takhtapalat kii afvaah udne lagi thi
 Meanwhile, Pervez Musharraf went to Colombo to attend the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Sri Lanka Army
 12 oktober ko musharif colombo se karachi laut rahe the, lekin karachi airport main unke vimaan ko utarane kii ijaajat nahin mili
 This order was given from the office of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 aanan-fanan main hi navaj sharif ne khwaja jiyauddin ko nayaa sena pramukh bhi ghoshit kar diya, lekin tab tak musharraf kii vafaadaar fouj rawalpindi se nikal chuki thi or usne jald hi pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko unke ghar main najarband kar diya
 Nawaz made the last move and ordered at the Karachi airport that Musharraf's plane be sent to India, but here too his dice turned backward, the airport was also occupied by the army
 12 oktober 1999 kii raat ko pakistan main takhtapalat ho gaya
 The elected government of the people was ousted from power and Pakistan once again came under the occupation of the army
 musharraf ne khud ko pakistan kaa chif akjicutive ghoshit kar kaman apane haath main le lee or samvidhan ko suspend karke immergency kaa elaan kar diya

 In March 2000, the trial of Nawaz Sharif started in the Anti Terrorism Court
 navaj sharif ko aadiyaala jail main rakhaa gaya tha, ye vahi jail he jahaan par julfikaar ali bhutto kaa trial hua tha or phir 1979 main unhen faansee de di gayi thi
 During Nawaz Sharif's trial, his lawyer was shot and killed
 is ghatana se dehshat or bad gai
 There were reports all over Pakistan that this trial is a sham, the same would be done to the military commander Nawaz Sharif, which was done by General Ziaul Haq with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1979
 pakistan ke sutron ke mutabik parvej musharif or unke faujee afasar bhi isi haq main the
 But Saudi Arabia and the United States were under constant pressure to leave Nawaz Sharif
 disambar 2000 main adaalat faisla sunaane hi vaali thi ki tabhi musharif ke saath navaj sharif kii deal ho gai or samjhaute ke tahat navaj sharif apane puure parivaar ke saath desh chhodkar saudi arab chale gaye
 Nawaz Sharif's new innings is starting in Pakistan after 14 years
 takadir kaa khel dekhie ab musharraf ghar main kaid hai or un par bhi deshadroh samet kai aarope hai
 The only difference is that Musharraf had decided 14 years ago, now it is Nawaz Sharif's turn

 bihar main ganga or gandak nadi ke sangam par aitihaasik, dharmik or puranic mahatv vaale sonpur kshetra main ek maheene tak chalane vaale prasiddh sonpur meley main bhi notebandi kaa asar saaf dekhne ke mil rahaa he
 Like every year in the fair, the market of toys, games and animals is decorated this year, but buyers of these goods are not coming
 prayek varsh karthik poornima se ek din pehle shuru hone vaale is meley main lakhon deshi or videshi paryatak pahunchate hai
 This fair is known today as Asia's largest animal fair
 vishwa prasiddh yah mela puri tarah saj-dhaj kar taiyaar he, lekin baahar se aane vaale dukandaaron main maayusi he
 The fair has been formally inaugurated on November 12, but from the day of Kartik Purnima, the fair of the fair is seen here
 kaha jaataa he ki is meley main sui se lekar hathi tak miltaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned 500 and 1000 rupee notes from midnight on 8 November
 ullekhneey he ki is meley main log atm or credit card se kharidari nahin karte
 Parshuram Singh, who came to the toy market from Ballia in Uttar Pradesh, has been setting up a toy shop here for the last 30 years, but this year he does not see any benefit
 unhone kaha, 'beete saalon main poornima ke din se hi pratidin teen se chaar hajaar ke khilone bik jate the
 This time it is also difficult to sell toys worth 500 rupees per day
 ' Mohammad Feroz, who brought warm clothes from Jammu and Kashmir, is also unhappy with the fair this year
 firoz ke mutabik, kharidaaron kii kam dilchaspee ke kaaran unhen apane garm kapadon kii keemat kam rakhni padi he, phir bhi khariddaar nahin aa rahe
 He says that it is not that people are not coming here
 meley main log aa rahe hai, parantu mela ghumkar waapas ja rahe hai, kharidari nahin kar rahe
 The impact of demonetisation is clearly visible in the fair's cattle market
 saaran jile ke dighavaara se aae pashu vyapaaree subodh raay bataate hai, 'ham log bahut pareshaan hai
 Nobody is taking old notes of 500 and 1000 rupees
 gaay kharidne ja rahe hai to log 'nayaka' note maang rahe hai
 For this reason there is very little cow here
 ' Here, the number of passengers on autos and mini buses coming from villages is also less
 ek auto chaalak ne bataaya ki anya varsho main mahua-mujffarpur mukhya maarg main avasthit katahaaraa, karauna, prakhand mukhyalay, mustafapur, khajechand chhapra, sumerganj sahit anya chowk chauraahon se 10 se 20 minute ke antaraal par sonpur meley ke liye vishesh bas, auto sahit anya gaadiyaan milti thim
 But this year there has been a decrease in the number of people going to the fair due to economic problems caused by people due to demonetisation
 tippaniyan At the same time, Akash, a Bangle merchant from Patna, expressed hope that everything will be alright
 meley main chudiyaan ke dukaan lagaae akaash ne kaha ki do-chaar dinon kii baat he
 The situation will be fixed
 abhi to mela shuru hue paanch din hi gujarey hai
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Every year lakhs of domestic and foreign tourists reach this fair, which starts a day before Kartik Purnima
 yah mela aaj asia ke sabase bade pashu meley ke rup main vikhyath he
 This world famous fair is fully prepared, but there is disappointment among the shoppers coming from outside
 meley kaa aupchaarik udghaatan 12 november ko hi ho chukaa he, lekin karthik poornima ke din se hi yahaan mela dekhne waalon kaa rela umadta he
 It is said that one can get needle to elephant in this fair
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 8 november kii aadhi raat se 500 or 1000 rupee ke noton par pratibandh laga diya
 It is noteworthy that in this fair people do not shop with atms and credit cards
 uttar pradesh ke baliya se khilonaa bazaar main aae parashuram singh pichley 30 varshon se yahaan khilone kii dukaan lagaate aa rahe hai, lekin is saal unhen phayda najar nahin aa rahaa
 He said, 'in the past years, three to four thousand toys were sold every day from the day of full moon

 ' jammu evam kashmir se garm kapade lekar aae mohammad firoz bhi is varsh meley se naakhush hai
 According to Feroze, due to less interest of buyers, they have to keep the price of their warm clothes down, yet buyers are not coming
 unka kahana he ki aisa nahin he ki log yahaan nahin aa rahe
 People are coming to the fair, but the fair is rotating and going back, not shopping
 meley ke pashu bazaar main notebandi kaa asar saaf taur par dikh rahaa he
 Subodh Rai, an animal trader from Dighwara in Saran district, says, 'we are very upset

 So when India Today Conclave introduced the Japanese way of public speech to Pecha Kucha - showing 20 slides of 20 seconds each for a total of 6 minutes and 40 seconds - four ministers of the Narendra Modi government proved that they were new He is quite adept at adapting himself to ideas and methods
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii daud main pradhanmantri modi ne aksar chaar ahm kshetron main bharat ko viksit karne kii apni pariklpana ko saamne rakhaa tha
 These four areas were - railways, road-transport, electricity and ease of governance
 do saal baad india today conklev-2016 in chaar ahm kshetron main unke kaamkaaj ko parakhane kaa mauka thi
 In this, four of his fellow ministers — Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, Minister of State for Power and Coal Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Nirmala Sitharaman — managed to leave their mark on observers
 kam se kam apane paine or dhardaar pechaa kucha prajentation se to ve aisa kar hi sake
 The half-hour high-speed slide show had two special themes - constant focus on planning and monitoring Modi and emphasis on achieving more
 alabatta unhen bahut acchhee tarah se pataa tha ki kaam ko puraa karne kii raftaar ko lekar sawaal uthaae jaaenge, isliye unhone upie kii viraasat kaa bahaanaa mustaidi se taiyaar rakhaa tha
 While Gadkari claimed that he had inherited 403 delayed and 730 stalled plans, Goyal had the feeling that 33 crore people from 18,452 villages were living in the dark without electricity when he took over

 Giving a rare insight into the way the government functions, Road Transport Minister Gadkari and Minister of State for Power and Coal, Goyal revealed that protests and disagreements are two permanent features of cabinet meetings, but the decisions are always in the interest of the country with everyone's consent are taken
 apni prastutiyon ke dauraan mantriyon ne bataaya ki sabase zyada jhidkiyaan goyal ko sunani padati hai or tathyon or aankadon kii joardaar jhadi lagaate hue gadakari sabase zyada bolte hai, vahiin pradhanmantri nae-nae vichaaron par bahes or charchaa ko lekar behad sahishnu hai, magar naakaaraapan ko lekar ve ratti bhar bhi sahishnu nahin hai or samay seemaa ke bheetar nattejey chaahate hai
 Due to such emphasis on time-bound results, they have been forced to examine new ways and ideas and work away from conventions
 rail mantri prabhu ko saal main 7 arab yatriyon ko dhone vaali relon main vigyaapan se rajasav kamaane kii jabardast sambhaavna najar aati he; gadakari nagpur main jaev eendhan kii kamyaabi ko desh bhar ke 1 lakh shaharon main dohraane ke mansoobey bana rahe hai; goyal dhan jutaney ke liye gaiyr-paaramparik sroton ko tatolane main bataur nivesh banker apni visheshgyata kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai, vahiin nirmala sitaraman ne start-ap ko badhaava dene ke liye desh bhar main 70 incubeshan centre kholane kaa vaada kiya
 And to fulfill their respective missions, they do not want to get entangled in the red tape net

 Name Savita Yadav, age 33 years
 is mahila ko saanp 60 se zyada baar das chukaa he, magar maut kaa saaya kabhi uske paas nahin pahunchaa
 These are not the lines of a script, but the reality of the life of a woman in Tikamgarh district of Madhya Pradesh who has to suffer from snake bites several times a year
 tikamgarh ke mohangarh panchayat ke kareeb he panchampura gaanv
 Savita, who lives here, has been identified as Sarpaddanshita
 savita ko pehali baar saanp ne tab dasa jab uski umr 19 varsh thi
 The average snake bites him four to five times every year since then, but death does not touch him due to the charisma of nature
 savita bataati he ki use jis raat sapane main saanp dikhataa he, vah samaj jaati he ki jaldi hi saanp uske kareeb aakar use kaat saktaa he
 This happens also
 vah bataati he ki ek baar bhi aisa nahin hua ki saanp sapane main dikhaa ho or use kaata na ho
 Not only this, when a snake bites him, only one exorcist from Lalitpur can bring him to his senses
 mazdooree karne vaale parivaar kii savita ke sharir par bane 60 nishaan saanp ke dasane kii kahani bayaan karte hai
 Showing the traces of snake bites in hands and body part, Savita says that she falls into unconsciousness after snake bites and family members rush to take her to Ojha
 hosh main aane par use kai din tak kamajori rahati he
 He claims that he repeatedly bites the same snake
 savita ke pati rajdhar kaa kahana he ki aisa nahin he ki saanp use sirf panchampura gaanv main rahane par hi katata ho
 Even when she is outside Panchampura, she has to be a snake target there
 gaanv ke kuch log is vaakye ko purnjanm se jodate hai
 He says that Savita must have been close to the snake in the previous life, which bites her in this birth
 is janm main donon alag-alag hai
 He comes to Savita because of his acquaintance
 savita ko saanp kyon dasata he or us par jehar kaa asar kyon nahin hota, isko lekar tarah-tarah ke kisse log ek-duusare ko sunaate hai

 In the pride of Rahul, stories were being read that he played an important role in stopping Modi's chariot in Bihar
 had to tab ho gai jab 17 may ko dilli nagar nigam ke upachunaav main 13 main se 4 siten jeetne par pradesh adhyaksh ajay maakan ne credit rahul gandhi ko de daalaa, lekin shaayad wo bhul gaye ki do din baad hi 19 may ko 5 rajyon ke nattejey aane hai or vahaan haarane par congress kaise haar kaa jimmedaar rahul ko tehra sakati he
 Maken may have increased his numbers in front of the high command, but on May 19, he left such a question for the media department and leaders of the Congress, which left everyone to sweat
 haar ke liye rahul nahin jimmedaarpichley kuch vakt se bukhaar ke chalate biimaar chal raherahul gandhihar chunaav kii tarah media se mukhaatib nahin ho sake
 But his message came on Twitter that we accept the decision of the public with humility
 congress kaaryakartaaon, netaaon or sahyogi dalon kaa chunaav main mehnat karne ke liye dhanyavad, jeetne waalon ko badhai
 We will work hard to win public confidence
 lekin 4 rajyon main congress haari to congress ke manager isi taiyaari main jute gaye ki haar kaa thikra yuvaraj rahul gandhi ke sir naa phoda jaae
 From different states to Delhi, Congress leaders got involved in this campaign with different arguments for each state
 rahul ko bachaane ke liye bahanekeral main haar ke baad rahul ke kareebi shashi tharur ne shuruyaat main hi morcha kholte hue kaha ki rajya main gutbaji or netaaon main ek-duusare ko nicha dikhaane kii koshish ke chalate ham haare
 Tharoor went one step further and said that now there is a need to change the organization at the national level as well as the state
 rajya main haar ke liye rahul ko jimmedaar tehraana galat he, kyonki loksabhaa chunaav abhi 3 saal dur hai
 At the same time, Kerala Congress in-charge Mukul Wasnik, who came to meet the media in the afternoon, refused to hold Rahul responsible for the defeat and said that the reasons for the defeat in the state will be assessed and then changes will be made
 tarun gogoi haar ke liye jimmedaarasbase dilachasp jawaab to assam kii haar ke liye saamne aayaa
 Congress's media in-charge Randeep Surjewala first dismissed the question of Rahul being responsible for the defeat, then told Tafsil that under the leadership of the most experienced Chief Minister in Assam, Tarun Gogoi, the Congress contested, some small parties on his opinion Alliances with Badruddin Ajmal did not align with his opinion
 chunaav prachaar or ranneeti unheen kii rahi, jiskakendriya netritv ne mahaj samarthan kiya
 Also, 15 years of anti-incumbency was also declared a factor
 pashchim bengal main haar par congress prabharee ne sadhi chuppiiske baad baat bengal kii ai, jahaan apni vichaardhaara ke vipareet jaakar congress ne left se chunaav purv gathjod kiya phir bhi mamata ko badi jeet se nahin roak pai
 Remember that the last time the Congress contested the assembly elections with Mamata and became part of the winning alliance
 is par jawaab dene ke liye assam or bengal ke prabharee seepi joshi to media ke saamne hi nahin aae
 This is the same CP Joshi, who was also in charge of Bihar and immediately after winning there, was busy talking to the media to tie Rahul's head
 congress ke media prabharee surajevaala ne bengal kii haar ke liye bhi rahul ko bachaate hue kaha ki rajya main kisase gathjod karnaa he, ye rajya ke netaaon kii raay or kaaryakartaaon kii chahat ke lihaaj se tay kiya gaya
 The state Congress decided the campaign strategy and issues in the state elections, so it is not right to blame Rahul who went to campaign only
 vaise bheetar hi bheetar congressi ye bataanaa nahin bhoolatey ki saalon baad bengal main unka netaa pratipaksh hoga
 In Tamil Nadu too, after the Congress had split with Hardik in Tamil Nadu, just before the assembly elections, the dmk's b team again lost to Jayalalithaa, the argument was similar to Bengal
 kaha gaya ki tamilnadu main congress pehle se kamjor thi, isliye diemke ke saath rajya ke netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke kehane par gathjod karnaa siyaasi majaburi thi
 The defeat there was mainly by the DMK and Jayalalithaa's victory, the Congress was just a small ally
 pudducheri main jeet ke baad jashn par hidaayatitna sab hone ke baad puure din aage peeche hote aakhir 30 vidhansabha siton vaale pudducheri se congress ke liye aakhirkaar koi to khushkhabari ai, jahaan congress ne satta hasil kar lee
 But in Delhi, the leaders were given strict instructions that rahul-rahul's drums should not be beaten for this victory or else the responsibility of the defeat of four states will fall on Rahul

 Cricket lovers are rarely able to forget Martin Crow's name
 newzealand ke is dianmik ballebaaz ko cricket kii duniya bhare hi sammaan se dekhati rahi he
 Under his captaincy, the way he led New Zealand to the semi-finals in 1992 is still exemplified today
 chaahe shuruaati overon main tufaani ballebaazi kaa silsilaa ho (kro ne ye kaam apane saathi cricketer mark greatbatch se karaayaa tha) yaa phir spin se opening gendbaazi karaane kaa kaam (deepak patel ko world cap main aajmaana) ye sab kro ne 1992 main kiya tha
 It was only after his experiments that the world of ODI cricket moved from instant to poor cricket
 yahi martin kro in dinon jivan or maut kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 Crowe is seriously ill due to rare types of blood cancer
 unhone world cap final se thik pehle apane ek kollam main likhaa he ki ye unka aakiri cricket match ho saktaa he
 He will be present at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to boost his team's morale
 iespien crickinfo website ke apane stambh main kro ne likhaa he- meraa jivan ab mujhe zyada match dekhne or use enjwaaye karne kii ijaajat nahin degaa
 It may prove to be my last match, but i am glad to accept it
 52 saal ke martin kro ke kollam ne puri kiwi team ko final muqaabale se pehle ek tarah se mauka diya he ki ve apane lijendary khilaadi ko sabase bada tohfa den, aisa tohfa jo khud kro 1992 main kiwi cricket ko nahin de paae the
 After reading his column, Kiwi team captain Brandon mccallum has mentioned his veteran player's contribution with respect just before the final
 maikkalam ne kaha, 'unke saath jo ho rahaa he, vah dukhad he
 We hope that they will be able to live in peace during their remaining time
 maikkalam ne yah bhi bataaya he ki gambhir beemaari kaa saamana kar rahe kro kis tarah se team kii jarurat ko samajhate hue kiwi team ke abhyaas main shaamil rahe
 During this time, he helped to improve the batting of Ross Taylor and Martin Guptill
 martin in donon ballebaazon ko apane betaa maanate hai or kehete rahe hai ki ye do vaise bete hai jo mere paas nahin hue
 Obviously, it is going to be a difficult experience for such Martin Crowe to watch the final match
 shaareerik taur par bhi or maansik taur par bhi, lekin in chunautiyon se jo ghabara jaae wo martin kro to nahin ho saktaa
 Martin Crowe has said, My condition is like nervous parents, but i will control my tears
 yah mere or kiwi cricket ke liye cricketting hilite sabit hone vaala he
 In such a situation, the team that will take the leadership of Brandon mccallum at the Melbourne Cricket Ground would like to make history for this legend cricket itself
 martin kro apane daur ke world class ballebaaz rahe jinhone 77 test maichon main 45 se zyada kii ausat se 5444 or 143 vanade maichon main 38 se zyada kii ausat se 4704 ran banaae
 These runs do not reflect Crowe's talent, but those who have seen Crowe playing will realize it well that a cricketer like Crow is seen in centuries

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 narendra modi ke netritv vaale endie ko maat dene ke liye congress vipakshi dalon ko ekajute kar mahagathbandhan banane kii koshish main he
 However, the Congress has not achieved much success in this campaign so far
 yahi vajah he ki kabhi bijepi ke netritv vaale endie kii kaman sambhaal chuke do diggaj netaa aaj usee ko maat dene ke liye congress ke netritv vaale UPA kaa kunba badhaane main jute hai
 Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu has joined hands with the Congress these days forgetting enmity

 In this episode on Thursday, he met Congress President Rahul Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, National Conference President Farooq Abdullah, SP President Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav
 chandrababu naidu kii hafte bhar main duusari dilli yatra kii
 Earlier on Saturday, Naidu reached Delhi and met with leaders including BSP chief Mayawati, Sharad Yadav and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and churned for the grand alliance
 haalanki naidu ek daur main bijepi ke netritv vaale endie kaa hissaa hi nahin balki sahyogi dalon ko sahejkar rakhane kaa jimmaa bhi sambhaal rahe the
 Naidu was responsible for keeping Mayawati, Mamta Banerjee and Jayalalitha together as NDA convenors during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee era
 bijepi ne 2013 main narendra modi ko jab piem pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya, to endie se jediu alag ho gai
 Due to this, Sharad Yadav also had to leave the post of NDA convenor, after which Naidu was then given the responsibility
 naidu 2013 se 2017 tak endie ke sanyojak rahe, lekin andhra pradesh ke liye vishesh darje kii maang ko lekar tidipi ne endie se alag ho gai he
 Now Naidu is trying to beat the same NDA
 sapa se lekar mamata banerjee or sharad pavaar sahit nitish kumaar se behatar rishte hai
 In such a way, Naidu is engaged these days to see how far he can succeed in this

 In such a situation, how successful is Naidu in bringing these two leaders together? Naidu is not alone but Sharad Yadav is also trying to unite the opposition
 sharad yadav bhi endie ke sanyojak rah chuke hai
 They are working to create an atmosphere against the BJP by doing Save the Constitution program across the country
 yadav is kaarykram main vipaksh ke tamaam netaaon ko ek saath manch par laa rahe hai

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main patel samudaay bhartiya janata party ke liye gale kii haddi ban gaya he
 Patidar leader Hardik Patel is seen pushing all the bjp's tactics and strategies on the backfoot
 patidaaron main bikharaav kii khabaron ko khaarij karte hue hardik patel ne ravivaar ko ek or bada daawa kiya he
 Hardik Patel made a tweet on Sunday among enthusiasts of the Patidars
 apane twit main unhone likhaa ki patidaar kii do mukhya sanstha khodldham or umiya dham oonja hi hamaari takat he
 Why did Hardik tweet? Hardik Patel is believed to have given another blow to bjp's efforts with this tweet
 darasal, aisa isliye kyonki isi hafte patidaaron kii 6 mukhya sansthaaon ke ek saath aakar patidaar kor cameti ke gathan kii baat saamne ai thi
 These institutions included Umiya Mataji Institute Unjha, Khodaldham Kagawad Rajkot, Sardar Dham Ahmedabad, Vishwa Umiya Foundation Ahmedabad, All Patidar Samaj Surat and Umiya Mata Sansthan Sidasar
 media reports ke mutabik, in 6 sansthaanon kii taraf se patidaaron ke aarakshan andolan ko hardik kaa privet andolan bataaya gaya tha
 At the same time, the matter of praise of BJP government was also revealed
 yahaan tak ki hardik patel ko nishane par lete hue 'patidaar anamat andolan samiti' ko 'privet anamat andolan samiti' tak bataa diya gaya
 But Hardik rejected all these things and claimed to have the support of the main institutions of the Patidars
 khodldham ne di thi safayeekhodeldham trust ke adhyaksh paresh gajeri ne bhi khud saarvajanik taur par safai di thi
 He said that no allegations have been made against Hardik Patel from Khodaldham
 paresh ne hardik ke privet andolan vaali baat se bhi inkaar kiya tha
 Hardik's declaration means that the two institutions that Hardik Patel has spoken of support are both very powerful
 hardik patel kaa daawa he ki gujarat ke kul 1 karod 6 lakh patidaaron main 99 fisadi patidaar inhen do sansthaaon ko maanate hai
 That is, the rest of the institutions of the Patidars have neither special existence nor strength
 saurashtra-dakshin gujarat main khodldhamkhodaladham kagvad kii baat kii jaae to ye sanstha saurashtra or dakshin gujarat main kaaphi tacover maani jaati he
 The Patel community of these two areas consider Khodiyar Mata as Kuldevi
 gujarat ke do patel samudaayon main se ek kadava patel khodiar mata kii puja karte hai
 From the voter's point of view, Kadva Patels constitute about 40% of the total voter turnout
 jo saurashtra or south gujarat kii siton par bada asar daalate hai
 While Umiya Dham Unjhosaouth in north-central Gujarat and Kadva Patel and their institution Khodaldham in the south are considered to have a major influence, the rest of north-central part of Gujarat is dominated by Leuva Patels
 darasal, in donon kshetron main umiya mata ko patel samudaay ke log kuladevi maanate hai
 Whose organization is Umiya Dham Unjha
 gujarat ke patidaar votaron main leuva samudaay kareeb 60 fisadi hai
 In such a situation, Leuva Patel, who considers Umiya Mata, plays a very decisive role in the elections
 haalanki, patelon ke ye donon samudaay hi bijepi ke paramparaagat voter rahe hai, lekin is baar halaat juda hai
 Both communities have moved beyond Patel and are now agitating under the banner of Patidar
 aarakshan kii maang par laathiyaan or goliyaan khaane se samudaay ke bich bijepi ke prati baari gussa bhi he
 This is the reason why Hardik Patel is making deals with Congress on their demands and repeatedly making claims to defeat BJP
 congress bhi inhen ke sahare apana do dashak purana siyaasi sookhaa dur karnaa chaahati he
 Importance of Dham The importance of these Dham in Gujarat politics can also be understood from the example that as long as Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister, he used to go to Kodaldham Mata in every election
 haalanki, aagaamee chunaav disambar main hona he, lekin abhi tak modi vahaan nahin gaye hai
 On the other hand, the Congress has definitely changed its agenda this time, under which Rahul Gandhi is taking refuge in temples on the Gujarat tour
 rahul gandhi ne saurashtra ke daure par khodldham mata mandir jaakar mattha teka tha
 Earlier, when Rahul visited Gujarat in December 2016, he went to Umiya Dham and prayed
 rahul kaa in donon dhaamon main janaa bhi pratikatmak taur par behad ahm mana ja rahaa he
 However, a final agreement is yet to be reached between Hardik Patel and the Congress
 aise main 9 or 14 disambar ko hone vaali voting se pehle dilachasp siyaasi sameekaran dekhne ko mil sakate hai
 i am returning what the world has given me, in the form of tajurbat-o-havadis

 mumbai kaa kamathipura kuch aise hi jamaane ko lautaa rahaa he, apane andar samete hue kadave jazbaat or tajurbon ko
 Kamathipura, amid the glare of Mumbai, is a blatant slap on the faces of both humanity and society
 asia ke sabase puraane red lite aria kamathipura kii sahami galiyon main sisak rahi hai, naa jane kitni himezloom auratonki majaburiyaan
 Sayings of blessings on compulsions are said when the compulsions go to the limit, some take the form of celebration in this condition
 ek baagi jashn
 Because they are adorned on the grave of compulsion
 ayyashiyon kii ye mahafilen
 It is not necessary to be a poet or a philosopher to understand the pain hidden in the tinkle of that environment
 ise samajhane ke liye aapkaa bas ek insaan hona hi kaafii he
 Who does not know that their faces have crushed their beauty before prostrating
 unke jismon ne damakane se pehle apni ruh kaa daman kiya he
 His body has crushed his mind before it starts to twitch
 yaqinan unke ghunghruon kii khanak khokhli he
 The compulsion of a sex worker or dancer is not the joy but the resentment in this rebellious party, dressed at the threshold of the public
 beintahaa aakrosh
 This resentment can be felt even before reaching the shaky lanes of Kamathipura
 chor bazaar se kamathipura ko jaataa ye rasta or is raste par padate ladkadhaate qadamon or machalate jazbaat ke saath pahunchate log
 Despite realizing the threat of a threat in the heart of your heart, do not know what the search goes on towards the narrow streets
 9 galiyon main deh vyaparmumbai shahar main jahaan sapanom kaa bazaar aabaad hota he
 Where the elusive fabric of glamor is woven
 usee mayanagari main maujuud kamathipura main glamer di-glamraise hota he
 Dreams break like glass
 jisaki kirchiyaan jism nahin ruh ko chalni karti hai
 In this environment, both the search for love or the beauty of beauty is unmatched
 kamathipura kaa puraa ilaaka mote taur par 16 galiyon main banta he
 But now the business of sex runs in only 9 lanes here
 galiyaan ghat gayi or graahak bad gaekmathipura kii galiyon kii taadaad bhale hi kam ho gai ho, lekin in galiyon kaa rukh karne waalon kii taadaad lagataar badhati hi gai
 Some are so that the steps here do not increase fast and if you increase the speed, then you start hitting shoulder to shoulder
 kamathipura aane waalon ke liye yahaan ke chalaave main itani kashish he ki ankhen sabakuch dekhte hue bhi dhokhaa khaane ko taiyaar hai
 Even after wandering street by street, nothing can be seen as achieved
 lekin talash he ki khatm hona hi nahin chaahati
 That is why neither this market ends nor the people who come here
 aisa hota he jismon kaa saudinhin sahami galiyon main anginat or kabhi na khatm hone vaali kai kahaniyaan hai
 It is important to identify these streets before going to the bottom of those stories
 in galiyon ke sabase poshida raaj hai
 There are four ways to run a business from here
 inamen se ek tareeqa he ki sex varkar diarect apane clyant se baat kar le
 The second is through brokers
 teesraa behad dardanaak he
 Forced with young girls locked in dark cells
 or chauthaa he kisi baar yaa maykhaane main sauda kiya janaa
 If you look at this picture of motivemathipura, you will find that shops here decorate like any common market
 lekin in dukaanon ke upar nazaren gayi to wo takaraaengi un jharokhon se, jahaan se sex workars kii asurakshit zindagiyaan jhaankati hai
 In order to overcome this insecurity, these sex workers are reluctant to deal with each customer for some time
 jo unki zindagi ko kuch mahafooz bana sake
 Often these insecurities make them intent on doing anything to make money from the customer
 khud ko aise pesh karti hai sex varkerbehisaab rang rogan or mechap ke saath alag-alag libaas or alag-alag andaaz main vahaan kii sex varkar dikhaai detii hai
 She presents herself as a showpiece in a show case
 inhen talash rahati he graahak kii or graahak ko talash hoti he, thode se vaqt ke adventure kii
 But the truth is that the customer's adventure ends
 magar in sex varkar kii zindagi adventure banakar rah jaati he
 a risky adventure involving diseases
 shoshan or is peshey kaa sabase bada dushman he budhapa
 The shelved streets of the shabu, peeping through the rooms, look like a local train
 musfir lagaataar aa rahe hai, ja rahe hai
 But where will this journey end
 isaki khabar chand lamhon ke musfir or hamasafar donon ko hi nahin he
 The dark cells of those narrow streets
 gali main aapane qadam rakhaa nahin ki dalal aapako kothri tak le jane ke har hatkande apanaayenge
 Girls will be counted well
 naa maanane par ye ek peshewar kii tarah apana visiting card bhi thama dete hai
 Well, you will go inside these pinky closet
 vaise hi aap duusari duniya main pahunch jaaenge
 Some corners with wooden stairs
 konon se lage darvaaze
 Tabernacle rooms peeping from inside doors
 in kamaron ke andheron se jhaankta fike pad chuke shabaab kaa fareb
 Everyone got like the sex workers working in the rest of the redlight area of fraud, the story of the sex worker here is the same
 koi pyaar main dhokhaa kha gai
 Somebody got into the limelight
 kisi ko gharavaalon ne hi is jahannam kaa rasta dikhaaya
 So someone told the broker this way to earn money
 yahaan andar aane ke darvaaze alag alag ho sakate hai
 But there is not a single exit route

 If you are going to work for the first time after studying or changing your job for the first time, then you have to keep many things in mind
 agar aap offis ke shuruaati dinon main in baton kaa dhyaan rakhenge to aapako aage koi mushkil nahin hogi
 First, understand the work culture
 There is a difference between college and office
 offis main log ek decorum kaa paalan karte hai
 Their time to eat and drink tea is fixed
 kuch had takkaamke liye samay seemaa bhi tay hoti he
 To prove yourself in the first job, it is necessary that you first understand the rules and regulations of any institution
 aajkal har daftar main yah mana jaataa he ki aap main intelegence koshent (aikyuu) or imotional koshent (icue) ke saath-saath cultural koshent (sikyuu) bhi hona chahie
 Even if you do not like a person, you should be mentally ready to work with him
 zyada naa bolenho saktaa he aap bahut acha joke crack karte hon or aapke dost aapaki is adaa par fida hon
 But in office it may not be liked
 agar aap bahut zyada bolte hai or dusron kii baat kaatane kii aapaki aadat he to ise bhi badal len
 Because in the office you are expected to be so serious that you will listen to the other first and then answer it
 meeting ke dauraan bhi baar-baar bich main na bolen
 If there is a very good idea, then share it, but do not feel that you are getting excited in the meeting
 parformens ke saath politeness bhiye baat thik he ki offis main khud ko kaarykushal dikhaanaa jaruri he, par iske saath-saath yah bhi jaruri he ki aap seniors or apane kaligs ke saath polite rahen
 If you make any mistake during work, instead of reacting fast to it, take responsibility for your mistake
 is tarah aap seniors kaa dil bhi jeet lenge
 Give a balanced answer: If you are new in the office, first of all understand the mood of your colleagues
 kyonki ho saktaa he ki aapke kisi joke par unhen gussa aa jaae yaa wo naaraaz ho jaaen
 Therefore, it is most important to bring people's personality before laughing
 iske alaava agar aapse kuch puch jaae to uskaa jawaab badha-chadhaakar dene kii bajaay tu da point den
 If you are not able to live up to your ability after exaggerating it, it will weaken your professional relationship with your seniors
 soshal media se durikolege main aap ho saktaa he, puure din main kai baar soshal media par chat karte hon yaa apadats karte hon
 It does not work in the office
 kuch sansthaanon main to soshal media ke istemaal par bain rahata he
 In such a situation, if you use social media on your phone or office PC in Office Hour, then it will be assumed that you are not serious about work

 agar rajasthan sarkaar or uski naukarshahi neend se nahin jaagi, to use dilli main sthit apni arabon kii sampatti se maharoom hona pad saktaa he
 The government price of the land falling within the periphery of Bikaner House in Lutyen Zone in central Delhi and Udaipur House in North Delhi is around Rs 169 crore
 banati he
 While the market value of Bikaner House is estimated at Rs 1,500 crore
 se adhik he
 Similarly, the government price of Udaipur House near Delhi's Lt
 Governor's residence (as per circle rate) is around Rs 52 crore
 he, jabaki bazaar mulya maujuuda jarjar halaat main bhi kareeb 300 karod ru
 It is made
 lekin centre sarkaar ne jahaan bhavishya main bhi bikaner house ko khaali karne kii kisi sambhaavna se inkaar kar diya he, vahiin dilli sarkaar ise rajasthan sarkaar kii sampatti maanane ke baavjood kabja chhodane ko raji nahin he
 Now the Rajasthan government officials are saying that the intention of the Central Government and the Sheila Government of Delhi is not clear
 aise main rajya sarkaar ke paas adaalat kii sharan main jane ke sivaa koi rasta nahin he
 But the Ashok Gehlot government's bureaucracy is unable to even bother to raise its voice in the interest of the state
 naam na chhapane kii shart par rajya se jude ek adhikari kehete hai, ''sarkaar sirf aagrahpurn chitthiyaan likh rahi he, jabaki apni hi party kii sarkaar ke khilaaf adaalat main jane ke liye rajnatik saahas kii jarurat he
 But party interest is overshadowing state interest
 ''bhenrosingh shekhavat kii nazeer dete hue ek adhikari yahaan tak kehete hai,''1977-78 main shekhavat sarkaar ne ek jatke main hi samooche bikaner house ko khaali kara chaabi apane haath main le lee thi, lekin baad main phir centre ne kabja liya
 Which is no longer agreed to leave the central government
 kendriya shahari vikaas rajyamantri saugat raay spasht kehete hai, ''bhavishya main bhi bikaner house khaali karne kii sambhaavna main nahin dekhtaa hum
 However, during the budget session of Parliament, Rai had said in the Lok Sabha in response to the question of MP Kirori Lal Meena, "the central government is struggling with the problem of lack of offices for its departments, so it is possible to vacate Bikaner House for the time being
 Is not
 '' lekin ab to centre sarkaar rajya sarkaar kii kumbhakarni neend kaa makhul bhi uda rahi he
 Says Rai, "since 1954, Bikaner House has been with the central government and now there is talk of a sudden evacuation
 ham achaanak kabja kaise chhod sakate hai
 "this moment of the central government is when it is not even paying any rent for this rented building
 yon raay kiraye ko lekar kisi vivaad se inkaar karte hue kehete hai ki kabhi kisi mukhyamantri ne aisi shikaayat darj nahin karai he
 But state government officials say that rent was received till 1977-78, but after that no rent has been deposited in either the Delhi Residential Commissioner's Office or Jaipur's General Administration Department or PWD
 sarkari dastavejon ke mutabik centre sarkaar ne 21 janvari, 1951 ko udaipur house or 15 may, 1954 ko bikaner house kiraye par liya tha
 But the Center handed over the Udaipur House to Delhi administration on 28 May 1965
 desh kii rajdhani main rajasthan se judi aadhe darjan se adhik ahm imaaraten hai, jinamein madhya dilli sthit jaipur house main modern art gailaree chal rahi he or ab yah puri tarah se centre sarkaar kii sampatti ho chuki he
 Regarding Jaipur House, a state official says, "shivcharan Mathur Sarkar has cost just five crores for a penny
 main centre sarkaar ke haathon bech di
 Similarly, Dholpur House, located in Lutyens' Delhi, already has a Union Public Service Commission office since independence
 iske bagal main kota house, jo british raaj main kota ke shaasha kaa mahal tha, ab nau sena ke kabje main he
 Jaisalmer House has offices of several central government departments, while the colony has settled in Jaipur estate near Nizamuddin railway station in South Delhi and some of these cases are in court
 karolbaag main sirohi house ke naam se do sampatti hai jisamen ek kaa kshetrafal 344
 The area of the second building is 227 if 6 square yards
 9 varg gaj he
 Which has a market value of about Rs 29 crore
 hogi
 People have been living in them for a long time and now removing them from there is crooked
 ek baar rajasthan sarkaar ne nilaamee karwaai thi, lekin pehle se rah rahe logon ke virodh kaa saamana nahin kar pai
 Says an IAS officer of Rajasthan cadre, "once after the auction some people came with weapons
 aise halaat main koi bhi khariddaar is sampatti ko kaise kharidega
 Apart from these buildings, Rajasthan has to fight a double battle for Bikaner House and Udaipur House
 sansad main centre sarkaar kii ore se die gaye jawaab ke mutabik bikaner house kaa 32,191 varg feet kshetra yani aadhe se zyada kshetra abhi bhi uske kabje main he
 Whereas after a long battle, the Center vacated a portion on 8 April 1999, after which the state government offices are running at 30, 133 square feet
 dilli main atirikt awasaiya ayukta vimal sharma kehete hai, ''yah to sirf nirmit kshetra he, jabaki 80,000 squair feet kaa khulaa kshetra bhi he
 Similarly, Kothi number 15 on Rajpur road near Lt
 Governor's residence in Delhi, which is spread over 12,000 square meters
 yah sampatti dilli sarkaar ke kabje main he, jisamen 2003 tak dilli sarkaar kaa shram vibhaag kaa daftar tha, lekin uske baad se yah sampatti jeern-sheern haalat main padi he or shila dikshit sarkaar ise rajasthan ke supurd karne ko raji nahin he
 Udaipur House has completely transformed into a forest today, which has become troublesome for the local residents as well
 is kothi ke bagal main rahane vaale kansaltent naveen khanna kehete hai,''sampatti kii dekh-rekh nahin hone kii vajah se yah puri tarah jangal main badal gaya he or aae din saanp-bichchhu jaise jahrile jeev nikalakar hamaare gharon tak pahunch jate hai
 Local residents say that this dilapidated and forested building has become a base for smokies, due to which thieves are also becoming very frequent in the area
 rajasthan sarkaar ab is sampatti ko hasil karne ke liye adaalat jane kii sochane lagi he
 Kerala won the Travancore House by winning the court battle, Punjab and other states have also acquired their property by resorting to law, in view of which the Rajasthan government has also moved the file for legal studies
 lekin gahalot sarkaar ke liye adaalat janaa aasaan nahin he, kyonki centre or dilli main congress kii hi sarkaar he
 However, before the legal battle, the Minister of State for Property Affairs in the Rajasthan government, Bharosi Lal Jatav, says, "if the Delhi government finds the Udaipur House on Civil Lines as an administrative point of view, then keep it
 lekin badale main koi waisi hi sampatti hamen chanakyapuri main de de
 While Chief Minister Gehlot is supportive of building the hostel
 centre main pratisthapit rajasthan cader ke ek iees adhikari kehete hai, ''agar udaipur house mil bhi gaya, to uskaa prashasnic istemaal sambhav nahin hoga
 In such case, it should make hostel for students coming to Delhi University from the state
 ''aitihaasik drushtikon se bikaner house nai dilli nagarpalika parishad kii heritage imaaraton kii suchi main pehali shrenee kii he
 In this building, round table conferences were held at the time of the British, after independence, the country's first Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had held a meeting of the integration of princely states
 lekin is heritage imaarat ko centre sarkaar ne jarjar avasthaa main pahunchaa diya
 When the Center left the part of the Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) on 8 April 1999, the then state government did not notice
 lekin jab vasundhara raaje ne mukhyamantri kii kursi sanbhali, to unhone bikaner house kaa vaibhav lautaaya
 However, stating that it was part of the Lutyens zone, the Center halted construction work in some parts
 jisase aaj bikaner house ke awasaiya parisar kii haalat kisi slam jaisi ho gai he
 In this dilapidated complex is the residence of peon, driver to gazetted officer
 dilli main pravasi rajasthaniyon kii aabaadi kariban 20 se 25 lakh he, jinamein majdoor se lekar vyavsaayee or udyogpati bhi shaamil hai
 But they are calling the Center and Delhi government's occupation of the state's assets unjust
 lekin kiraye par lee gai sampatti mul maalik ko na lautaane par log hairaangi prakat karte hai
 People say that when the Center took over Hyderabad House during the Narasimha Rao government, in return, it gave large land for Andhra Bhavan next door
 lekin rajasthan sarkaar kii sampattiyon ko centre nahin chhod rahaa
 If the center relinquishes its possession, the tourism of the state can be promoted along with promoting the art-culture of Rajasthan
 gujarat ne apni jameen par shah auditorium banaaya, kerala sarkaar ne shaikshanik sosayadi bana rakhi he, to karnataka ne saanskrithik sangam bana rakhaa he
 Tamil Nadu has a Tamil confluence, but Rajasthan has nothing of its own despite having a wealth of billions in the country's capital

 ravivaar ko team india or srilanka ke bich final muqabla khelaa janaa he jiske baad tay ho jayega ki koun si team tii-20 champion banati he
 Virat Kohli currently at the forefront
 
 
 team india ke jaanbaaj ballebaaj viraat kohli toornament main ran banane waalon kii res main sabase aage bane hue hai
 Kohli has played 5 matches in the tournament so far and during this time, he has scored 242 runs with a tremendous average of 121, while not being out 3 times
 is dauraan viraat ne 3 pachaasa jade hai or semifinal main south africa ke khilaaf kheli gai 72 ranon kii pari unki best pari rahi he
 In this list, they are followed by Tom Cooper of the Netherlands, who has 231 runs in his name
 tisare number par netherlands ke hi stephen miberg hai, jinhone 7 maichon main 224 ran banaae hai
 Rohit Sharma can move ahead of Virat
 
 
 viraat kohli ko agar is res main koi pichhaad saktaa he to wo hai team india ke salaami ballebaaj rohit sharma or mahela jayavardhane
 Apart from this, the rest of the players have been eliminated from the race because only their teams have been eliminated from the tournament
 rohit 171 ran banaakar 8wein number par hai or agar unhen is res main viraat se aage nikalnaa he to kam se kam 71 ran banane honge
 But in that case either Virat does not get a chance to bat or he is out without scoring runs
 viraat kii maujuuda form ko dekhte hue aisa mushkil hi lagata he
 Sri Lankan batsman and Mahela Jayawardene, who is going to play his last International T20 match, is at number 16
 jayavardhane ke naam par philhal 134 ran darj hai
 Mahela Jayawardene needs 108 runs to match him
 lekin tii-20 main centuri jadna itnaa aasaan nahin he
 At the moment, Virat is the only strong contender to win the race
 aswin banenge 'best' bowler!vahiin agar gendbaajon kii baat karen to south africa ke phiraki gendbaaj imran taahir 12 wicket lekar top par hai, lekin unki team toornament se out ho chuki he
 Apart from this, the same number of wickets are registered in the name of Ashan Malik of the Netherlands, but his team has been out in league matches
 carabian gendbaaj samual badri 11 wicket lekar list main tisare number par hai or unki team bhi semifinal main dam tod chuki he
 Now comes the number of r Ashwin
 aswin philhal 10 wicket lekar chauthe number par hai lekin number 1 banane ke liye unhen final main srilanka ke khilaaf kam se kam 2 wicket lene honge, jo ki bahut mushkil task to nahin he
 Ashwin may not have had a good start to the T20 World Cup but in the last 3 matches he not only made a comeback but also became man of the match 2 times
 aswin ne pehle 2 maichon main ek hi wicket liya tha lekin baaki 3 maichon main 9 wicket jhatak daale
 It should not be difficult for him to take 2 wickets in such form now
 amit mishra bhi hai is res main
 
 
 Another spin bowler Amit Mishra of Team India is also involved in this race
 mishra 9 wicket ke saath chathe number par hai or aswin se aage nikalne ke saath toornament ke number-1 gendbaaj bhi ban sakate hai
 After being beaten in the semi-finals, Mishra will take his life to return to the finals
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki amit or aswin main se kis 'A' kii kismat uskaa saath detii he or usko tii-20 world cap kaa best gendbaaj banaati he

 uttar pradesh main sattarudh samaajawaadee party (sapa) par chutki lete hue amit shah ne kaha ki uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav se apana kunba to sanbhal nahin rahaa, vah rajya kya sanbhaalenge
 Addressing a public meeting at the conclusion of the Dhamma Chetna Yatra at Brijendra Swaroop Park in Kanpur on Friday, Amit Shah said that no one else has done as much work as the BJP government did in honor of Babasaheb Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar
 phir chaahe vah ambedkar kii janmabhumi kaa uddhaar karnaa ho, unako bharataratna sammaan dena ho, unpar dak tikat, sikaa jari karnaa ho
 
 
 Only the BJP has paid attention to the sentiments of Baba Saheb and his followers

 Mayawati was blessed by the Dhamma heroes, so her government was formed
 lekin unhen aashirwad dene vaale bhikshu ab dukhi hai, kyonki mayawati ne baba sahab bhimrao ambedkar ke sapanom ko puraa nahin kiya
 He said that after the formation of BSP government in Uttar Pradesh, it was hoped that she would do welfare of Dalits and backward, realize the thoughts and dreams of Lord Buddha and Ambedkar, but it did not happen
 mayawati kii sampatti dinon-din badhati gai, lekin dalit pichhadaa or bhadant vahiin kaa vahiin rah gaya
 Bhadant, who blessed Mayawati and formed her government, is now supporting the BJP
 unhen gyaat he ki bijepi kii sarkaar banane par dalit, pichhadaa, bhadant sabakaa kalyaan hoga
 Amit Shah said that sister Mayawati talks about Ambedkar's ideals, but she supported the Congress-led UPA government at the Center for 10 years
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ne jis rajya main sarkaar banaayi vahaan baba sahib ko puraa sammaan diya gaya

 If the BJP comes to power in the state, under the mission of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas, welfare of all, including Dalits, Backward will be done
 iske liye pradhanmantri ne kai yojanaayen bhi shuru kii hai
 Taking a dig at the SP government of the state, Amit Shah said that assembly elections are going to be held in Uttar Pradesh in February, but law and order is not being managed with Akhilesh Yadav
 'akhilesh pehle apane kunbe kii kanoon vyavastha sudhaar len, jo unase sanbhal nahin paa rahi he baad main pradesh kii kananu vyavastha bhi dekh len
 How they will not solve the home fights of Uttar Pradesh
 ' He said, Mayawati says that if she comes to power, law and order will improve, we are saying that declaring her assets Dalits will understand how well they have been benefited
