 america rajnatik arthshaastri henry jorge ne 1886 main prakashit apni mashhoor kitaab protection for free trade main mukt vyapaar ke paksh main sabase chutili or laajawab daleel di
 When he wrote this book, there was a wave of globalization earlier, business policies were becoming liberal in the world
 phir bhi, unka apana desh sangrakshanvaad kaa pratik bana hua tha
 Evidently, George's target was one argument by the protectionists of that period
 us pustak main jorge kehete hai, sangrakshan kaa taatpary rokna or raksha karnaa hota he
 In this way tariffs prevent foreign goods from entering our country
 magar baadh, bukamp yaa tufaan jaisi prakritik kriyaaon ke vipareet, vastuon kaa pravaah aadamiyon kii gatividhiyon kaa nateeja he
 George asks, "who are the people who cause the goods to flow?" The answer may undoubtedly be foreign sellers
 haalanki jorge kii daleel he ki yah chhalaava he kyonki vikreta apane utpaada bech hi nahin paata, agar hamaare log kharidne main ruchi nahin dikhaate
 Therefore, foreign goods flow due to our people
 sangrakshanvaad "sangrakshiton'' ko hi usase roktaa he jo ve chaahate hai; yani sangrakshan videshiyon ke khilaaf nahin, apane logon kii ichchhaaon ke jabaran daman jaisaa he
 At the time when George wrote this, free trade was going on in most colonies
 yah upniveshon kii marji se nahin, balki aupniveshik takaton ne to ise apane phaayde ke liye badhaava diya tha
 However, during the war, when the colonies came to decide their own trade policies, they adopted a policy of protection
 aage chalakar, dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad jab upniveshon ko rajnatik aazaadee mili, to unhone pehle se bhi zyada sangrakshanvaadi rukh apana liya
 India also followed this path
 yuddh ke varshon ke dauraan kapadaa or loha tathaa ispaat udyogon ko ghor sangrakshanvaadi niti kii jarurat thi or mili bhi
 The recession during World War II led to more stringent import controls than ever before through import licensing
 aazaadee ke baad, 1958 main jab bhugtan santulan sankat khadaa hua to desh ne videshi mudra aadhaarit bajet apanaaya
 This change paved the way for a trade policy that was close to patronage
 aise log jinhen 1960 ke dashak se 1980 ke dashak tak kaa daur yaad ho, ve bataaenge ki tab jivan kitna kathin tha
 No consumer goods could then be imported, and producers also had to struggle with red tape to import raw materials and machinery
 bhartiya utpaadakon ko 1991 main aanshik aazaadee hasil hui
 The government decided to remove import licenses on raw materials and machinery
 lekin unhone puri aazaadee kaa anand tabhi liya jab sarkaar ne tarriff kaaphi had tak kam kiya
 The waiting period was longer for Indian consumers
 vishwa vyapaar sanghathan ke dabaav main upabhokta vastuon par aayaat license 2001 main jaakar samaapt hua
 Our Ministry of Commerce lost the case in Geneva but our consumers tasted independence
 vyapaar main udaarikaran ke saath hue anya sudhaaron kii badaulat bharat ne 21veen sadi ke shuruaati 17 varshon ke dauraan prati vyakti aay main jitani vruddhi dekhi, utani puri 20veen sadi main nahin dekhi gai
 2 in 2017-18
 6 kharab dollar ke sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) ke saath, bharat ab vishwa kii chhathi sabase badi arthvyavastha he
 In the next 10 years, we will stand after the US and China and become the world's third largest economy
 yani angreji raaj ke pehle ke gauravshaalee din aane ko hai jab vaishvik arthvyavastha main akele bharat or china kaa sanyukt yogadan aadhe se adhik kaa hua karata tha
 Achieving this goal will require sustained economic reform and a commitment to openness
 aaj, hamaara aayaat jidipi ke kareeb 20 fisadi se adhik kaa ho chukaa he, aayaat par lagaam kasne ke liye bharat kii naukarshahi phir se sangrakshanvaadi rujhaan dikhaa rahi he
 In the latter half of the 19th century, the things that George said in the context of America are applicable to India today
 sangrakshanvaadi prayaason ke liye ek tark diya jaataa he ki abhi hamaare udyog shishav kaal main hai
 George urged the Americans of his era to stand firm against such arguments
 unhone tark diya, "abhi tak ke anubhav yahi bataate hai ki ek baar jab ham sangrakshanvaad kii ore kadam badha dete hai to protsaahan kii yah niti majbootee dene kii bajaae tabaahi kii ore le jaati he
 This leads to weakness, not strength
 vastav main sarkari protsaahan main chalane vaale "shishu udyogon'' ko sangharsh karte hue takat hasil karne kaa koi mauka hi nahin miltaa
 As a result of this, they will surrender to the big challenges faced by the market in the absence of experience
 ''jorge ne tark diya ki ek baar sangrakshan kii aadat lag jaati he to phir "shishu udyog'' kabhi bada hi nahin hota or bina sangrakshan ke vah na to khadaa ho paata he or na hi jivit rah paata he
 George reminded his countrymen that industries that had been patronized as "babies" in the early days of America are still seeking protection, claiming themselves to be in infancy
 jis samay un udyogon ko sangrakshan diya gaya tha "us samay ke shishu ladke or ladkiyaan paripakv hue or phir bujurg purush or mahilaayein ban gaye hai, or kuch to puraa jivan jeene ke baad duniya se vidaa bhi ho gaye hai
 "these" baby industries "have also emerged in a big way, but they are not ready to give up the benefits of the" baby act "
 
 
 jorge ke nazariye se dekhen to hamaare desh kaa auto udyog bilkul vaisaa hi dikhegaa jise shishu udyog ke naate aazaadee ke baad se ab tak videshi spardhaa se bachaaya gaya he or aaj tak nishiddh tarriff kaa anand le rahaa he
 Today, a question stands before India whether India should also take retaliatory action against the recent tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum by the US
 jorge ne vyapaar niti ke maamle main "aankh ke badale aankh'' vaale drushtikon se bachane kii salaah di he
 Incidentally, he gave the example of US tariffs for the iron industry in his arguments for this
 unhone tark diya ki is tarriff ke kaaran britain jaise kisi bhi anya vyapaarik saajheedaar kii tulana main america ko hi zyada chapat lagi he
 Due to the high tariffs of the United States, the losses incurred on exports to the United States from Britain were compensated by increasing its iron exports to other countries
 lekin "louh or louh ayask par jo aayaat shulk america ne badhaayaa usase america utpaadon kii laagat main vruddhi hui or isse britain ko duniya main apana vyapaar badhaane main madad mili kyonki america utpaada british utpaadon ke mukaable mahange the or is tarah hamane apane nikatatam pratispardhi ko nuksaan pahunchane kii bajaae phayda hi pahunchaa diya
 We handed over our trade to South America and other countries where our reach and our share could be much larger than them
 ''mujhe keval ek paristhiti aisi dikhti he jisamen main bharat dwaara pratishodhpurna tarriff kaa samarthan kar saktaa hum kyonki isse apane rashtriya hit ko aage badhaayaa ja saktaa heru basharte bharat america ko apana tarriff uchit samay par waapas lene ko raji kar le
 If it does not, then initially we will hurt him even a little in this war of America, but in the long run we will suffer big losses
 america ko apane tarriff waapas lene ke liye pratishodhatmak karrwai se dabaav bananaa tab sambhav ho saktaa tha, agar ispaat or aluminium ke sabhi pramukh niryaatak iske khilaaf pratishodhatmak karrwai karte
 But the European Union and Canada have rushed to the US seeking tariff waivers
 isliye isaki sambhaavna na ke baraabar he
 Therefore, it will be to our benefit that in return for retaliatory action, we should ask America for more beneficial concessions in those areas in which it can give easily and which will be a good deal for that too

 Even after 67 years, the mystery about Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, who has been called the 'great hero' of the Indian freedom struggle, has not been revealed
 
 
 varsh 1945 main 18 agast ko taiwan main hue kathith vimaan haadase main unki maut ke sach kaa pataa lagane ke liye teen-teen ayog banaae gaye, lekin sach ab tak saamne nahin aayaa
 
 
 Many people of the country still believe that Netaji did not die in the plane crash and he lived long after independence, but spent his life in oblivion
 
 
 netaji ke bare main dheron kisse-kahaniyaan prachlit rahe
 
 
 Many saints and saints claimed themselves to be Netaji, which deepened the mystery
 
 
 taiwan sarkaar ne apana record dekhakar khulaasa kiya ki 18 agast, 1945 ko taiwan main koi vimaan haadasa hua hi nahin tha, jisase netaji kii maut kii kahani ko sach na maanane waalon kaa yah vishwaas or majboot ho gaya ki azaadi kaa yah mahanayake bharat kii angrajon se mukti ke baad bhi jivit tha
 
 
 Anuj Dhar of 'mission Netaji', who has written books on the mystery of Subhash Chandra Bose, claims that the Indian government knows everything, but it does not want to deliberately hide the secret
 
 
 unhone kaha ki isiilie sarkaar ne soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat daayar unke aavedan par bhi unhen netaji se judi jaankaree uplabdh karaane se inkaar kar diya
 
 
 By the way, all the investigations that took place to know the truth of Netaji and his death story, something came out in all of them, due to which this story got further complicated
 
 
 taiwan main kathith vimaan haadase ke vakt netaji ke saath rahe karnal habib-ur-rahamaan ne azaad hind sarkaar ke soochna mantri ese naiyar, roosi tathaa america jasuson or shahanvaj samiti ke samaksh virodhabhasi bayaan die

 kabhi unhone netaji ke antim sanskaar kii taarikh 20 agast, 1945 to kabhi 22 agast bataai

 Veteran fighter Ramsingh of Azad Hind Fauj believes that Netaji lived for a long time after independence and the country's poor politics never allowed him to come forward
 
 
 tippaniyan Subsequently, the Justice GD Khosla Commission set up in July 1970 also gave the same report as the Shahnawaz Committee
 
 
 iske baad netaji kii kathith maut kii jaanch ke liye varsh 1999 main teesraa ayog gathit kiya gaya, jiskaa naam mukherjee ayog tha
 
 
 In its report, it dismissed Netaji's death in the plane crash and said that further investigation is needed in the case
 
 
 mukherjee ayog ne 8 navambar, 2005 ko apni report bharat sarkaar ko saunpi thi, jise 17 may, 2006 ko sansad main pesh kiya gaya, lekin sarkaar ne report ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 
 
 Meanwhile, many people associated with the Azad Hind Fauj have claimed that 'gumnami Baba', who lived in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh, was Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, and he secretly met Netaji
 
 
 anuj dhar ne bhi apni kitaab 'india'za biguest cover-ap' main kai gopneey dastavezon or tasveeron ke hawaale se daawa kiya he ki netaji varsh 1985 tak jivit the

 The Taiwan government, seeing its record, revealed that there was no plane crash in Taiwan on August 18, 1945, which further strengthened the belief of those who did not believe the story of Netaji's death that this great freedom fighter was British Was still alive after liberation
 
 
 subhaashachandr bose ke rahasy par pustaken likh chuke 'mishan netaji' ke anuj dhar kaa daawa he ki bharat sarkaar sab kuch jaanati he, lekin vah jaan-boojhkar rahasy se pardaa uthaanaa nahin chaahati

 Looking at the current political situation in Gujarat, it seems that the magic of Hardik Patel has started coming from the head of the Patidars
 do saal pehle hardik ke ek farmaan par rajya kaa patel samudaay apni jaan nyochhavar karne ko taiyaar tha, lekin siyaasi shatranj par aisi baziyaan chali gayi ki aaj vahi patel samudaay hardik patel se duuri banane main laga he
 a lotus is blooming in the hearts of Hardik's colleagues who raised the rebellion flag against the BJP two years ago and they are joining the BJP one by one
 hardik dhire-dhire gujarat kii siyaasi ranbhumi main akele padate ja rahe hai
 This pain of his loneliness is now visible from his tweet too

 Today, two lines of Bajpaiji have been missed, obstacles will come, there will be a great fall of the great holocaust, embers under the feet, if it blows on the head, you will have to laugh in your hands, laugh, burn with fire, walk with footsteps

 bazaar par najarphyde ke share Former army chief General VK Singh, while clarifying on his first statement on Tuesday, has said that the bribe to the ministers of Jammu and Kashmir is wrong
 isse pehle, khabaren thim ki purv senapramukh ne daawa kiya he ki rajya ke mantriyon ko sena paise detii rahi he, kyonki rajya main sthayitv banaae rakhane ke liye unhen mantriyon se kaam lenaa hota he
 The former general also demanded an inquiry into the leak of the intelligence unit's report and said that it is treason to talk publicly about the intelligence unit and its reports
 jis tarah se report ujagar hui he, general singh ne uske peeche bhi saazish hone kii ashanka jataai he
 Former army chief VK Singh said that it is absolutely wrong to say that a minister was bribed
 yah rakam un logon ko janata kaa dil jeetne ke liye di gai thi, or aisa rajya sarkaar kii madad ke uddeshy se kiya gaya tha
 General Singh said that in fact, that secret unit of the army works against the separatist forces of the state
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah khufia ikai unke nahin, dijiemai ke tahat kaam karti thi
 The way the Intelligence Unit's report was exposed, behind this, General Singh expressed fear of conspiracy and said that it did not take care of the country's image, it is treason
 isse purv jammu‚àíkashmir ke mantriyon ko sena se paise milane ke purv senapramukh ke bayaan ke baad raajnneeti garma gai thi
 On his statement, Home Minister Sushil Shinde had said that VK Singh should mention the names of politicians
 yadi vivaran diya jaataa he to ham jaanch kar sakate hai
 In fact, VK Singh had said in a statement to an English newspaper that the army gives money to all ministers in Jammu and Kashmir
 general singh ne bataaya tha ki sena aisa rajya main sthayitv banaae rakhane ke liye karti he
 He said that ministers have to do many things as well as carry out many activities
 darasal, general ne yah bayaan apane upar lagaae gaye aaropon ke jawaab main diya tha
 He is alleged that during his tenure, Jammu and Kashmir Minister Ghulam Hasan Mir was given Rs
1 crore 19 lakh from the Technical Support Division to destabilize the state government
 haalanki apane is bayaan ke baad wike singh ne kaha ki ho saktaa he saare mantriyon ko nahin, lekin kuch mantri or log zarur hai, jinhen khaas kaam karwaane ke liye rakam di jaati he
 On this statement, National Conference President Farooq Abdullah says that VK Singh's statement is unfortunate and should be investigated
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki sena kisi bhi party ke liye funding nahin kar sakati he or agar aisa hua he to galat he
 Farooq Abdullah said that now the case should be investigated by the CBI to find out who took the money, and how the money has been used

 The political quarrel of Maharashtra has reached the threshold of the Supreme Court, on which the court can now pronounce the verdict on Monday
 maharashtra kii raajnneeti main shanivaar ko us samay hangaamaa khadaa ho gaya jab rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ke netaa or party mukhiya sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar devendra fadanvis ke saath dipti siem pad kii shapath lete hue tivi screen par najar aae
 The results of the Maharashtra assembly elections came on 24 October
 uske baad se sarkaar gathan ko lekar daavpech jari tha or ise lekar tamaam tarah ke kayaas bhi lagaae ja rahe the, lekin is baat kaa kisi ko andaja nahin tha or na hi kisi ne sochaa hoga ki ensipi kaa koi netaa bijepi ke saath jaakar dipti siem pad kii shapath le legaa
 However, on the state of Maharashtra's politics, Ajit Pawar did a trick that surprised everyone
 ye bhi padhein-sc main maharashtra par mahabahas, jaane aaj kis paksh ne kya pesh kii daleelensupriya sule ko nahin tha andajyajit pavaar ke is kadam se ensipi kii saansad or sharad pavaar kii beti supriya sule itani dukhi huin ki unhen kahana padaa ki iskaa bilkul andaja nahin tha
 Supriya Sule said that the party had also broken up with the family
 lekin iske baavjood pavaar parivaar kii koshish he ki kisi bhi tarah ajit pavaar ko manaaya jaae or unhen ensipi kheme main phir se waapas bulaayaa jaae
 Sharad Pawar and Supriya Sule also spoke to Ajit Pawar's brother Srinivas on Sunday
 yah jagajaahir he ki ajit pavaar ensipi ke bheetar pehle se hi kaaphi mukhar rahe hai, lekin sawaal he ki jab ensipi, congress or shivasena ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kii koshish kar rahi thi, tab phir ajit pavaar ne achaanak aisa kadam kyon uthaaya?ye bhi padhein- nirnaayak mode par maharashtra kii raajnneeti, sarkaar gathan main ye 11 chote dal bhi rahenge ahmakya galati kar baithe ajit?maharashtra main shivasena se alag hone ke baad jab bijepi ne apane boote sarkaar banane se haath khadey kar die to shivasena ne ensipi or congress ke saath sarkaar banane kii kavayad shuru kar di
 In a meeting on Friday evening, it was decided that the three parties led by Uddhav Thackeray would form the government
 ajit pavaar ko ensipi kaa vidhayak dal kaa netaa chunaa gaya tha or uddhav thakare ko samarthan dene vaala jo patr taiyaar kiya gaya tha, us par bhi unke hi dastakhat the, jiskaa istemaal ajit pavaar ne devendra fadanvis ke saath sarkaar banane main kiya
 However, it was believed that decisions had also been made in the government regarding the portfolio
 yah bhi tay mana ja rahaa tha ki shivasena-ensipi or congress kii sarkaar banati to ajit pavaar usamen bhi dipti siem hi banate
 This one step of Ajit Pawar led to a rift between the NCP and the Pawar family
 haalanki sutron ke hawaale se kaha ja rahaa he ki ajit pavaar ko manaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 If he did not go with the BJP, a Shiv sena-ncp and Congress government would have been formed, Ajit Pawar would have been the deputy CM
 lekin ab agar wo maan bhi jate hai to or unki ghar vaapasi ho jaati he to kya ensipi pehle kii tarah hi un par bharosa kar paaegi? Prince Harry may consider former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama his friends, but it seems that he will not be able to invite her to his wedding
 is saal 19 may ko prince harry or megan markel vivaah ke bandhan main bandhane vaale hai
 Prince Harry has also interviewed former President Barack Obama for his radio show
 lekin phir bhi vah baraak obama ko is khaas pal main shariq hone ke liye aamantrit isliye nahin kar paaenge kyonki isse yues raashtrapati donald trump apamaanit mahasoos kar sakate hai
 The leader, who called Prince Harry's fianc√©e as UGLY, was fired from the party, a source told the Daily Mail, "president Donald Trump will not be invited because only friends and family members are being invited to the wedding
" yah koi sarkari kaarykram nahin he
 In such a situation, if Mr
 Obama is called, Trump may find it bad and the royal family does not want any diplomatic dispute to arise
 trump ke pehle se hi britain ke shahi parivaar ke saath rishte danvadol sthiti main hai
 Trump has also canceled a previously scheduled tour to London
 yah trump kii britain kii pehali yatra hoti
 If i was president, i used to get jammed, now i get stuck in traffic myself: According to Obamasutras, "nothing has been decided yet
" ek sutara ne bataaya, abhi tak hamane nimantran nahin bheje hai or naa hi guest list taiyaar hui he to kisi ko kya pataa ki unhen bulaayaa jayega yaa nahin? ham is sarprise kaa majaa kharaab nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 
 'canington pales ke pravaktaa ne is mudde par koi bayaan nahin diya he
 He also said that at the moment there would be no discussion with the media about harry-meghan's marriage
 33 saal ke prince harry or obama achche dost hai
 At the same time, how much the royal couple dislike the new President of America, Donald Trump, is well known
 sutron ke mutabik, shahi kapal trump ke saath tanaav ko or nahin badhanaa chahta he

 bihar (bihar) se khulne vaali trainon main bihar ke khaas vyanjanon kii kami mahasoos karne kii baaten ab puraane din kii baaten hone vaali hai
 Passengers in these trains will now be able to enjoy the special cuisine of Bihar

 Not only this, now the waiters of the pantry car will also greet you by saying 'good morning' and 'hello-hi'

 irctc's regional manager Rajesh Kumar said that the famous cuisines are being included in trains to brand the Bihari cuisine
 unhone kaha ki IRCTC ke kolkata sthit kshetreey mukhyalay ne patna offis ko jo list bheji he uski jimmevary hotel prabandhan santhaan (IHM) ko di gai he he
 IHM is studying these dishes to serve the passengers in a special way
 unhone bataaya ki dakshin bharat kii trainon main idli, dosa or pashchim bharat se khulne vaali trainon main bhi sthaneey vyanjan yatriyon ko parose jate hai
 Kumar says, "trains opening from stations in North Bihar including Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur in Bihar will have chuda-dahi option for passengers
 yatri litti-chokha or ghughni kaa bhi swaad chakh sakenge
 Travelers can also enjoy rustic chicken with litti, vegetable with dalpudi, chuda and moong ghunghi, curd and pickle with sattu paratha
 "unhone bataaya ki shanivaar ko khichdi ke saath dahi or papad kaa vikalp maujuud rahegaa
 Kumar said that there used to be a complaint of the passengers that food like home is not available in (local) trains
 yatriyon kii isi shikaayat ko dur karne ke liye railway ne yah yojana banaai he
 Here, passengers are also happy with this plan of the railway

 This will not only provide a better environment for passengers in trains, but passengers will also be able to enjoy the journey
 shaam chah baje mukhyamantri pad se istipha or subah 10 baje phir se siem pad kii shapath
 In Nitish Kumar, the record set by resigning and then taking oath in just 16 hours does not look like another example in Indian politics
 bihar ke is raajnneetik ghatnakram se sawaal uth rahe hai ki agar nitish ko jediu se naata todakar bijepi se haath milaanaa hi tha, to unhone khud istipha kyon diya jabaki unke paas tejasvi yadav ko barkhaast karne kaa zyada aasaan vikalp tha? darasal iske peeche bhi ek bada raajnneetik sandesh chipa he
 Instead of giving RJD a chance to become a victim, Nitish thought of showing himself as a bargain to gain more, which is why he surprised everyone with his resignation
 tejasvi kaa istipha yaa barkhaastagi kaa tha intjarkarpshan ke aaropon main ghire upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav par jab jediu or nitish ne kadaa rukh akhriyaar kiya to ye saaf ho gaya tha ki yaa to tejasvi yadav khud istipha denge yaa phir nitish unhen barkhaast karenge
 On Wednesday evening, when the JDU called its Legislature Party meeting, everyone was waiting for the news that Nitish sacked Tejashwi
 lekin nitish ne sabko chaunkaate hue khud hi apane pad se istipha de diya
 Nitish would have survived without resigning even if he wanted to, according to political experts, when Nitish had decided to part with the RJD, he had two options before either dismissing Tejashwi or resigning himself
 donon hi sthitiyon main unhen bijepi kaa samarthan miltaa or sarkaar bachi rahati
 If RJD withdrew support after Tejashwi's dismissal, Nitish could have secured the trust vote by gaining bjp's support in the House
 aise main unhen na to istipha dena hota or na hi phir se shapath grahan kii jarurat padati lekin iske baavjood unhone doosraa vikalp chunaa kyonki iske do raajnneetik phaayde the
 Tejashwi was not given the chance to become a Victim
 Tejashwi sacked Tejashwi and did not give him a chance to become a Victim
 kyonki isse tejasvi rajya main sahanubhuti bator sakate the or unka raajnneetik kad bhi isse bad saktaa tha
 When Lalu Yadav and his family also realized that Nitish was adamant on this issue, he also talked about not resigning from Tejashwi so that Nitish had to sack him and RJD could take political advantage of it but Nitish took his bets Surprised Lalu
 nitish ne badha liya apana kadatejasvi ko barkhaast karne kii bajaay jab nitish khud istipha dene rajbhavan pahunch gaye to unhone ek bada raajnneetik sandesh dene main kamyaabi hasil kii ki wo karpshan se samjhauta nahin karenge bhale hi iske liye unhen apni kursi chhodani pade
 The statement that Nitish made while coming out of the Raj Bhavan also says a lot about his political agenda
 rahi sahi kasar khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ke un twits ne kar di jisamen unhone nitish ko unke istife ke liye badhai di

 ‚Äô unhone kaha ki donon mulkon ko vishwaas bahaali ke liye soochnaaon kaa aadan pradaan karnaa chahie
 Qureshi said, 'I think that sharing of information will also build trust
 ek duusare ke vichaar samajhane se bhi kai mudde spasht ho jaaenge
 He said that if both the countries' start pointing fingers at each other, who will benefit from it, neither to India nor to Pakistan
 sach to yah he ki ise sirf aatankwaadiyon ko phayda pahonchega
 So we should not fall into this trap
 ‚Äôkuraishi ne kaha ki donon deshon ko is bare main vichaar-vimarsh karnaa chahie ki aatankwaad se ubarne ke liye donon ek duusare kii madad kis tarah kar sakate hai
 Referring to the terrorist attack on Mumbai in November 2008, Qureshi said that the atmosphere was' corrupted 'after the tragedy and that' India took a very harsh decision to postpone the dialogue which in my view was probably not right
 ‚Äôbharat or pakistan ke bich evam dakshes rashtron ke darmyaan vyapaar sambandhon ko badhaane kii jarurat par bal dete hue kuraishi ne kaha, ‚Äòmujhe lagata he ki bharat or pakistan ke bich vyapaar kii badi sambhaavnaaen hai
 There is great potential for trade between SAARC nations as well
 ‚Äô unhone kaha ki dakshes kshetra ke bheetar vyapaar simit rahaa he kyonki 8 sadasyeey samooh ke do bade desh bharat or pakistan apane muddon ko varshon biit jane ke baad bhi hal nahin kar sake
 He said, 'if we bridge the gap of lack of trust, the whole atmosphere will change
 bharat or pakistan ke bich sambandh yadi saamaanya ho jaaen to paryaton ko badhaava dene kii apaar sambhaavnaaen hai
 Pakistan wants a good neighborly relationship with India
 ‚Äô pakistan ke videshmantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne kaha ki pakistan main aise kai log hai jo bharat kii yatra par jane ke liye bade utsuk hai kuraishi ne kaha, ‚Äòyadi hamaare sambandh behatar hote hai, ham vija niyamon ko udaar bana sakate hai, isse kaarobaari gatividhiyaan badhengi
 i think it will build trust
 isse donon deshon ke logon ke bich samparkon or sambandhon main sudhaar hoga
 ' najeeb jang
 must have heard the name! The name of LG Najeeb Jung is like any general knowledge question in Delhi these days
 pataa he to koi baat nahin, lekin nahin pataa he, to aapke bare main poochne vaala, sochane lagata he
 These days Delhi and the country are used to seeing less of the 'war level' which is going on between Kejriwal government and LG
 yahaan tak ki 2014 ke mahachunavi baras or modi-rahul reliyon ke dinon main bhi vaisaa 'romaanch or ection' dekhne ko nahin miltaa tha
 In Sheila Dixit's Raja Yoga, i never saw Najeeb Saheb going towards war
 shaayad ek vajah yah rahi ho ki saare nirnay shila jang sahab se poochkar karti rahi hon! agar nahin to kabhi to koi anban hui hogi, mujhe to google baba se mili nahin, aapako mili to bataaen, jarur
 Delhi is like it is today
 to phir yah 'jang kyon nai' he? kya isamen modi sarkaar or piemo kii bhoomikaayen utani hi maasoom or sanvaidhanik hai, jitani kii bhaajapa ke pravaktaa bataate hai? yaa bijepi kejariwal ko sarkaar ke pinjre main kaid karne ke master plan main vyast he! agar aisa he to yakeen maniye vah khud ke paanv main kulhadi nahin maar rahi he, balki paanv ko aara mashin main daal rahi he, jahaan se koi paanv waapas nahin aata
 This country has seen many times full of political differences
 yahaan centre or rajyon main lambey arse tak alag-alag sarkaron ne apana kaam ek duusare ko koste hue guzaara he, lekin unke dainik kaamon or jimmedaariyon ke nirvaah main aise rode kaa rajnatik naatak hamane kabhi nahin dekha
 i am jealous of the energy of PM Narendra Modi and his mastery of speech in speech
 vah aseem urja or raat din kaam main duube rahane vaale netaa or pradhanmantri hai, jaisaa ki unke twitor acount se hamen samay-samay par pataa chalata he, lekin kya ve abhi tak 'ellection mod' par hai
 Has Modi brought our constitutional and normal political dignity and traditions above the danger mark? baat jang se shuru hokar piem modi par isliye ekagra ho gai he, kyonki piemo is 'dilli kii jang' kaa centre banataa dikh rahaa he
 After all, we know our Prime Minister as a leader who is not spared, does not hide his choice
 unhone adwani, joshi ko maarg 'darshak' bana diya
 Made Amit Shah a pioneer
 kejariwal ko piem modi apni sabase badi chunauti maanate hai
 Kejriwal has harassed them a lot
 yahaan tak kii thali main dikh rahi dilli ek jatke main chin lee
 But this way of keeping Kejriwal's animosity at heart and seeking revenge can be more overwhelming
 yahaan masalaa, party kaa nahin he
 This is the capital of the country and the people who selected you for pm's huge heart and 56-inch chest
 janata to ek baar vot dekar aapse aas lagaae ghar baith gai, lekin aap na to ghar main dikhte hai or na hi un sanvaidhanik mulyon ke prati sammaan prakat karte dikhte hai, jinke liye aapako chunaa gaya tha
 Even abroad, they continue to curse the Congress
 haa, aap bolte changa hai, jaisaa ki kabhi nahin bolne vaale manmohan singh ne kaha ki aap superhit vaktaa hai, jiske vaadon par janata nisaar thi, lekin ab vah chaahati he (isamen dilli bhi he) videsh niti or vahaan jaighosh ke bich uske aansuon or muddon kaa bhi zikr or samaadhaan ho
 Letting the Government of Delhi work and removing the obstruction in the form of LG is one such thing
 ham sab chaahate hai ki yah jang jaldi se jaldi khatm ho or yah aapke bina hastkshep ke sambhav nahin
 If Delhi gets the message that your government is stuck due to its work, then its effect can be very negative in the upcoming examinations (elections) of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 janata aapako dilli main baithaana chaahati thi, so usne kar diya, lekin usne baaki jahaan-jahaan jise baithaaya he, agar wo kaam nahin kar paaenge or aapkaa naam ginaayenge to isaki keemat aagaamee do sabase badi jangon main chukaani pad sakati he
 Yes, one more thing
 kejariwal kii is baat se to aap sahamat hi honge ki chunaav jang ko nahin ladanaa he, isliye kejariwal sarkaar ko kaam karne den or apni party se kahen ki vah bihar or uttar pradesh kii jang kii taiyaari kare
 Hand over Delhi to Kejriwal, because this is the mandate
 tippaniyan In the midst of this battle, i am reminded of 'badlapur'
 bhaajapa ko apane netaaon (khaskar dilli main sakriy) ke liye varun dhawan kii 'badlapur' kaa sho jaldi rakhana chahie
 This film very sensitively explains that no matter how important and holy your revenge is, it also hurts you as much
 isliye bhaajapa or modi sarkaar jitani jaldi is badlapur mod se baahar aegi, dilli ko kejariwal ke vivek par chhod degi, utana uske or dilli ke liye behatar hoga
 Otherwise, everyone will have to pay the price of 'war'
 in dinon kejariwal sarkaar or alji ke bich jis 'yudhstar' par karrwai chal rahi he, waisi dilli or desh kam hi dekhne ke aadi rahe hai
 Even in the days of the 2014 Mahachunavi years and modi-rahul rallies, there was no such 'thrill and action'
 shila dikshit ke rajyog main kabhi najeeb sahab ko jang kii ore jate nahin dekha tha
 Perhaps one reason has been that all the decisions have been made by asking Sheela Jung Saheb! If not, there must have been a conflict at some time, i have not met Google Baba, if you have met, then definitely
 dilli jaisi aaj he, jamaane se waisi he
 So why is this 'war new'? Are the roles of Modi government and PMO as innocent and constitutional as BJP spokespersons in this? Or BJP is busy in the master plan to imprison Kejriwal in the government cage! If this is the case, then believe him, he is not hitting the ax in his own foot, but putting the foot in the saw machine from where no foot comes back
 is desh ne rajnatik matbhedon se bhare khub jamaane dekhe hai
 Here at the Center and in the States, different governments have spent a long time cursing each other, but we have never seen the political drama of such an obstacle in the maintenance of their daily work and responsibilities
 mujhe piem narendra modi kii urja or bhaashanon main tanj kii nipunata se irshyaa he
 He is a leader and prime minister steeped in energy and night and day work, as his Twitter account tells us from time to time, but is he still in 'election mode'
 kya modi hamaari sanvaidhanik or saamaanya rajnatik maryaada or paramparaon ko khatre ke nishaan se upar tak le aae hai
 The matter has started focusing on PM Modi, because the PMO seems to be the center of this 'delhi Ki Jang'
 aakhir ham apane pradhanmantri ko ek aise netaa ke rup main jaanate hai, jo bakhshate nahin hai, apni pasand chhupate nahin
 He made Advani, Joshi the route 'audience'
 amit shah ko pathpradarshak bana diya
 PM Modi considers Kejriwal as his biggest challenge
 kejariwal ne unako khub tang kiya he
 Even Delhi seen in the plate was snatched away in one stroke
 lekin kejariwal kii dushmani ko dil se lagaae rakhane or badla chukaane kaa yah tarika kahin zyada baari pad saktaa he
 The issue here is not about the party
 yah desh kii rajdhani or un logon kaa he, jinhone aapako piem vishaal hriday or 56 inch kii chaati ke liye chunaa tha
 The public once voted and sat in the house waiting for you, but you neither appear in the house nor show respect for the constitutional values for which you were elected
 yahaan tak ki videshon main bhi congress ko koste rahete hai
 Yes, you are healed, as Manmohan Singh, who has never spoken, said that you are a superhit speaker, whose promises were public, but now she wants (there is also Delhi) her tears between foreign policy and there Jaighosh There should also be mention and resolution of issues
 dilli kii sarkaar ko kaam karne dena or usamen alji rupi rukaawat ko dur karnaa aisa hi kaam he
 We all want this war to end as quickly as possible and it is not possible without your intervention

 haa, ek baat or
 You will agree with Kejriwal that the battle of elections is not to be fought, so let the Kejriwal government work and ask your party to prepare for the war of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh

 time magazine dwaara donald trump ko person of da year ghoshit kiye jane par meraa sawaal tha ki aakhir kis vajah se trump ko is khitaab se nawaja gaya
 Sexual Exploitation? Apartheid? Fundamentalism? The answer to my question was clearly shown on the cover of the magazine - it was unexpected for a trump sitting on a plush chair to reach the pinnacle of power
 haalanki is saal bharat main agar kisi shakhsiyat ko donald trump jaisi kismat ke saath ubharate dekha gaya to vah deshbhar main atm ke baahar vardi pahanakar kursi par baitha security guard he
 Even though his chair is not as luxurious as Donald Trump's chair
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kinotbandi ghoshnaase pehle yah shaks akelaapan or aseem dhairya kaa pratik tha
 Mosquitoes, fog and harsh winter make this person's work very complicated
 yahaan tak ki sadak par awara kute tak atm main andar-baahar karne main is shaks kii parvaah nahin karte
 This person's life resonates with only two tunes - the noise of traffic and the noise of the AC at the ATM
 is shaks kii dasha puri tarah se desi he or 2015 tak to atm ke baahar inkaa tainaat rahanaa jaruri bhi nahin tha
 However, the work of this man is full of immense responsibilities
 iske baavjood is shaks kaa vajood atm par adrishy he
 We do not even see this person while coming to the ATM
 yah sochna to dur kii baat he ki kya dinabhar main kuch khaane-pine kaa samay miltaa he
 At the same time, even in the darkness of the night, the shadow leaves it
 atm ke baahar lagi tuuti-phooti kursi yaa phir footpath iskaa bistar ban jaataa he
 By November 8, someone who did not have consistent luck, his fate changed overnight
 yah adrishy shaks notebandi lagu hote mahatvapurn ho gaya
 ATM attendees realized its presence
 kuch log muskura kar dua-salaam karne lage to kuch chaay-pani poochne lage
 At the same time, it also started becoming a victim of people's anger
 raaton-raat yah shaks guard sahib ban gaya
 After the ban on demonetisation, friendship started growing towards this person
 logon ne apana mobile number guard ke mobile main seve karana shuru kar diya jisase atm par nai khushboodaar karansi se bhari cash vine aate hi inhen soochna mil sake
 People began to bond with the guards so that despite the long queues, they let them use more than one debit card
 badi vinamrata or muskaan ke saath guard ne apni is nai shakti ko is tarah grahan kiya maanon yah shaktiyaan uske paas lambey samay se thi
 He started helping people to withdraw money, explained the correct way to use the card and answered a question "ATM is running", thousands of times a day
 is dauraan is shaks ke andar kaa udhyami bhi jaag uthaa
 He started taking his debit card and password from unknown people so that he could withdraw a maximum of Rs 5000 from the ATM just before 12 pm and after 12 pm
 mahaj chote se kamishan ke liye usne notembdi ke daur main kai logon kii is adhiktam cash ko nikaalane kii bhukh ko shant kiya
 Even in the late night, the work of this man does not end because people come and stop at the ATM like a zombie
 bina thake yaa bina kisi khij yah raat bhar logon ko bataata "nahin chal rahaa he bhai"
 The story of this man is truly unpredictable and no one expected this increase in his powers
 haalanki yah trump se alag he kyonki yah shaktiyaan zyada din iske saath nahin rahane vaali or jald hi vah apni tuuti-phooti kursi par baithkar ek baar phir adrishy ho jayega
 But with the restraint with which he has played the role of 'president' in the distribution of new currency in the country in these few days, there is no message that he is India's Person of the Year

 Munish Mishra does not stop here, he says, there is a grand temple of Vishwanath in the premises of BHU
 aise main kaise koi muslim khaastaur dharm vigyaan kii kaksha main padhaane ke liye ja saktaa he
 While studying theology is also said to maintain purity in food, but if the teacher is a Muslim, will he not eat meat and fish? If he eats, is he able to teach 'dharm Vigyan'? This is also written in a booklet released last year titled "history of Kashi Hindu University"
 is pustika ko khud maujuuda vaais chancelar ne hi jari kiya tha
 On the one hand, students are intent on not allowing any Muslim teacher to enter the Sanskrit Religion Department, on the other hand they cannot go against the standard constitution of University Grants Commission (UGC)
 samvidhan dharm, jati, gender ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav karne kii ijaajat katai nahin detaa
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge before the university administration is to not allow the UGC standard to be breached in the face of protests
 haalanki kathith taur par vaais chancelar ne 14 november ko hui baithak main vyakti se upar samvidhan ko rakhane ke saath hi is maamle main kanoonee raay lene kii baat kahi thi
 But according to the official statement of the university administration, the selection process released in BHU has been made clear by denying that there is any opposition against any kind of mail or BHU Act, that the selection process has been done according to the rules
 duusari taraf chaatr andolan lagaataar badhata hi ja rahaa he
 On the condition of anonymity, a professor of another department of BHU, while giving his opinion on this controversy, said, whether it is Aligarh University or Banaras Hindu University, in a secular country to recruit a particular religion based teacher or to recruit a student or Neither can be allowed

 [hollywood films not included]‚Äî taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)june 8, 2018 The Shiv Sena, through its mouthpiece Saamana, has again targeted the BJP today and asked if the President is in your pocket? In fact, on Friday, BJP leader and Finance Minister in the Government of Maharashtra, Sudhir Mungantiwar had said that if the new government is not formed in the state by November 7, then President's rule can be implemented here
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar gathan main mukhya baadha shivasena kii dhai saal ke liye mukhyamantri pad kii maang he
 On this, it is written in the face that currently the politics of Maharashtra has become a fun 'procession' and who is responsible for it? Further, the Shiv Sena taunted Sudhir Mungantiwar and said that the extinguished firefly of the departing government is making Maharashtra difficult by making new jokes every day
 aapako bataa den ki shivasena ab bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon chhodkar anya vikalp talashne lagi he
 It is reported that Uddhav Thackeray has spoken to NCP chief Sharad Pawar and on Monday Pawar will meet Congress President Gandhi

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 8 november 2016 ko desh main notebandi kaa elaan kiya tha
 In such a situation, what is the effect of demonetisation on the weavers in the Prime Minister's parliamentary constituency, Benaras
 ise jaanane ke liye aaj tak banaras ke saraiya ke amarpur bataloiya ilaake main pahunchaa
 It is a small colony of weavers
 notebandi se kamai par padaa asarmohammad abdul jaleel kaa parivaar pichhali kai pushton se banarsi sari banane ke vyapaar se judaa he
 Abdul Jalil, 63, and his son are weavers, but the family is still suffering from the note ban imposed in the country a year ago
 bunakar abdul ajij ne bataaya ki 7 saal pehle unhone apane ghar par chaar handloom kii mashiinon ko hataakar power loom banaaya tha
 After which the family's income used to be around seven to eight thousand rupees a month, but after demonetisation, their earnings have come down to only three to four thousand rupees
 notebandi se band hua bunakaron kaa kaarobaaraunhone kaha ki banaras or aasapaas ke kai jilon main banarsi sari ke bunakaron kakaarobaar notebandike baad lagbhag thap ho gaya he
 He and his son, along with two artisans, worked on the four handloom machines at Abdul Jalil's house
 jinhen 100 se 200 rupee pratidin mazdooree dete the
 But Abdul Jalil was also unable to pay them their wages after the demonetisation
 jisaki vajah se donon karigar kaam chhodkar waapas apane gaanv chale gaye hai
 Due to demonetisation, work on 2 power looms out of 4 power looms of Abdul Jalil has stopped completely
 halaat aise hai ki vah khud or unka betaa 2 power loom par kaam karte hai or raat main vah banaras ke maidagin ilaake main dihadi kaa kaam karte hai
 With this, they earn an additional Rs 300 per day
 jiesti lagu hone se dhaagaa kharidne main bhi asamarthnotbandi kii maar se abdul jaleel kaa parivaar abhi ubhar bhi nahin paaya tha ki jiesti kii dohari maar pad gai
 After the implementation of GST, they also had to buy Tani Bana (thread which makes saris) to make Banarasi sarees
 kyonki jiesti lagu hone ke baad isaki keemat bad gai or vah ise kharidne main sakasham nahin hai
 Similar situation is with another weaver Nisar Ahmed of Saraiya and his 4 brothers
 kuch saal pehle nisaar ahamed or unke bhaaiyon ne 5 handloom mashiinon ko hataakar powerloom mashin lagaai thi
 5 Artisans used to work on it, but after the ban on imposition of demonetisation, Nisar Ahmed and all his brothers could not give wages to these artisans, then they were discharged
 shakeel ahamed bhi ek bunakar hai jo saraiya ilaake main hi kaam kiya karte the lekinnotbandike baad unke maalik ke kaarobaar kii haalat kharaab ho gai
 Because of which they were not getting their wages
 isliye shakeel ahamed ne bunakar kaa kaam chhodkar trollies chalaane kaa kaam shuru kiya
 But due to his lack of earning in this too, Shakeel Ahmed has started the work of selling vegetables in Saraiya area
 jisase unki rojaanaa 100 se 200 rupee kii kamai ho jaati he
 Abdul Jalil, Nisar Ahmad and Shakeel Ahmad are not among the 4 lakh weavers working in Banaras and adjoining districts who were hit by demonetisation that could not overcome it even after 1 year
 
 jaankaar bataate hai ki banaras or aasapaas ke jilon main sari or anya textile material banane kaa puraa kaarobaar notebandi se pehle salanaa do hajaar karod rupee kaa tha lekinnotbandike baad isamen 50 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav, who was facing the charge of demolishing his government bungalow before it was vacated, came out of the media when he came out in front of the media today to explain
 akhilesh ke nishane par har koi tha siem yogi adityanath, governor ram nik, varisht afasar or media bhi
 Akhilesh described the entire controversy as a conspiracy against him and even said that he suspected that someone could harm him as well
 akhilesh ne bangala vivaad par kaha ki main kahin to rahoonga
 If i stay in a guest house, i have heard that such a pill has come, which has neither color nor taste
 agar kisi ne mere khaane main mila di to main kya karuunga
 When media personnel started smiling at this statement of Akhilesh, he said that it is not a joke
 ye rajyapal samvidhan kii aatma se nahin chal rahe hai, balki aresas kii aatma se chal rahe hai
 In a way, Akhilesh has told the government about the danger to his life in gestures
 vaad par akhilesh kii safai- bangale main maine saamaan lagavaaya tha, ukhaad laayaa'jahaan bijepi vaale soe, vahaan kyon soun'press conference main akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki ham guest house main gaya to vahaan par pataa nahin koun-koun soya hoga
 He said that how can we sleep on a mattress, how can we sleep on the mattress where the BJP man has slept
 unhone kaha ki kal ko main apana gadda le jaaoongaa to ye bolenge dekho gadda bhi le gaye
 Akhilesh said that i did not like saffron color in the guest house, so we hid it
 mujhe safed rang pasand he
 
 
 
 jab gusse main laal-pile akhilesh bole- mujhe meraa mandir lautaa dokhilesh ne kaha ki mere ghar main mandir dekhakar logon ko jalan ho rahi he
 Some people have become blind in jealousy
 apane ghar main hamane mandir banwaaya tha, ab chaahe hamen wo mandir bhi waapas lautaa dijie

 com / munumnkhou Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched the National Nutrition Mission from Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan
 piem modi ne is dauraan vahaan maujuud mahilaon or bacchon ko sambodhit bhi kiya
 The PM also reached the hall and communicated directly with everyone
 yahaan raily main piem ne mahilaon se judi kai baaten kii
 Read some important things
 
 
 1
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in this program that International Women's Day has been celebrated in the world for more than 100 years
 aaj puraa desh jhunjhunu ke saath judaa he
 2
 raily main piem ne kaha ki mere virdohi jitna bhi mujhe bhala-bura kahen unki marji he bas aisa karen ki agar piem bole to uskaa matlab narendra modi (pradhanmantri) nahin poshan mishan hona chahie
 This will go a long way in enhancing this mission
 hamen kuposhan ke khilaaf jang ladani hogi
 
 
 When PM Modi started playing with little girls in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan
 piem ne kaha ki jhunjhunu jhukna nahin jaanata mushkilon se jujhna jaanata he
 He said that in our country women are worshiped, but what happened is that they have to fold their hands and feet to save the daughter
 or sarkaron ko bajet nikaalnaa pad rahaa he
 The PM said that today when the difference in the birth rate of boys and girls is seen, it is very sad
 4
 He said that now people have to decide that the more sons will be born, the more daughters will be born
 jitna betaa padhegaa to utani hi beti bhi padhegi
 We should start this from today itself
 5
 The PM said that if the mother-in-law in the house says that we want a daughter, no one has the courage to stop the daughter from being born
 betiyon ke janm ke liye jaagarukta failaani hogi
 6
 piem bole ki hamaari sarkaar ke aane ke baad hamane haryana se beti bachaao beti padhaao ko launch kiya
 After which there has been a considerable improvement in the ratio of birth of daughters there
 aaj desh main betiyaan naam roshan kar rahi hai
 7
 jo log maanate hai ki betaa he, budhaape main kaam aayega to ye galat he
 i have seen many times that sons live a life of comfort, but parents live in old age homes
 8
 PM said that i have come to Jhunjhunu after thinking
 jhunjhunu jile ne beti bachaao beti padhaao ke abhiyaan ko shandaar tareeke se aage badhaayaa he
 So i could not stop myself from coming here
 9
 Daughter is not a burden, daughter is the pride and pride of the whole family
 10
 For the 'son-daughter-one' sentiment, we need to create a social and mass movement
 70 saal pehle ek mulk ke do tukade hue
 After this, no ruler of North Korea ever stepped on the land of South Korea for the entire 70 years and on April 27, when the leaders of the two countries joined hands for the first time, on the 27th of April, both the hands were in each other's hands
 They were, but the steps were still in their respective countries
 baad main donon ke kadam ek-duusare kii sarajameen par pade or iske saath hi uttar korea ke netamarshall kim jongun apane desh ke pehle aise netaa ban gaye jinke kadam dakshin korea main pade
 It was a matter of 70 years worth of steps to take 40 steps
 ginati karen to shaayad 40 kadam
 But it took 70 years to take these 40 steps
 ji haa 70 baras
 For the first time in 70 years, a North Korean ruler was going to step on South Korea's land
 70 saal pehle hue korea ke do tukade ke baad donon koriai deshon ke liye ye vakt ek aitihaasik pal banane ja rahaa tha
 Kim's 40 steps and
 
 
 uttar korea ke taanashaah marshall kim jong un kareeb 40 kadam chalate hai or phir ek jagah aakar thahar jate hai
 Actually, this is the line that divides the borders of North Korea and South Korea
 nafrat kii buniyaad par khinchi gai is lakeer par is vakt jahaan kim jong un khadey hai wo uttar korea he
 And across the line is South Korea, where the leader of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, currently stands
 seemaa par mili donon netaaon ke hathkim jong un sarhad kii is lakeer ke kareeb pahunchate hi ruk jate hai
 His steps are still in North Korea
 wo vahiin khadey hokar apana haath aage badhaate hai
 Moon Jae-in standing on South Korea's land across the line also raises his hand from there
 ab donon netaaon ke haath mil rahe the
 But even now both were in their respective countries
 dakshin korea kii sarajameen par kimaiske baad kuch der tak donon muskuraate hue baat karte hai
 While talking, Moon Jae-in Kim Jong gives them a party to come to South Korea
 kim usee vakt pehla kadam uthaate hai or doosraa kadam dakshin korea kii zamin par tha
 After 70 years, a ruler of North Korea had now set foot on South Korea's land
 kuch pal ruke kim jong uniske baad donon netaa pehle uttar korea kii taraf munh kar tasviren khinchvaate hai
 Then turn like this
 ab munh dakshin koricea kii taraf ho chukaa tha
 Photos were now being taken down by South Korean media
 ab kim jong un ko dakshin koricea kii taraf janaa tha
 For further conversation
 dakshin korishake netaa unhen chalane kaa ishaara bhi karte hai
 Moon steps into North Korea when Kim Jong makes a request to the leader of his neighboring country
 is guzarish ke saath hi ab kim
 
 moon je-in kaa haath pakadte hai
 Turn back
 bas do kadam uthaate hai or iske saath hi ab donon netaa uttar korea kii sarazamin par khad the
 Here the two leaders once again shake hands with warmth
 phir waapas do kadam uthaate hai or dakshin korea pahunch jate hai
 Will the hate streak be erased? Now both the leaders were moving towards the frontier of South Korea
 aage kii baatcheet ke liye
 Although the outbreak of the border still holds its place

 At that time, i often fell in the circle of protecting myself and i also got hurt

 The session of the newly elected Lok Sabha begins on Monday, but the opposition camp is still scattered
 rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) ne ravivaar ko sarvadaleey baithak bulaai
 But no such initiative has been seen from the opposition so far
 congress netaa or rajyasabha saansad piel puniya ne kaha he ki loksabhaa ke nav nirvaachit saansadon ko shapath dilaane ke baad vipakshi dalon ke netaa mil sakate hai
 The Congress is yet to announce its leader in the House
 loksabhaa chunaavon main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko mili baari janadesh se vipaksh kaa vishwaas hill gaya he
 The Parliament session is going to start from Monday, but the opposition parties are still not able to recover from the shock of the big win that Narendra Modi got
 yani vipaksh sadan main satta paksh kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar bhi nahin dikh rahaa he
 There has not been any attempt to coordinate between the opposition parties to surround the Modi government on all the issues, nor has there been any official statement from these parties so far
 congress netaa piel puniya ne 'ajtak' se kaha, 'abhi to samay he
 In fact, work in the Lok Sabha will start from June 20
 shuru ke teen din to nav nirvaachit sadasyon ko shapath dilaane or prashasnic kaamon ko puraa karne main lag jaaenge
 'he said,' i am confident that the Leader of the Opposition will come on a platform to decide on the Modi government in the Lok Sabha on various issues and decide the future strategy
 'congress adhyaksh kii maujuuda sthiti ko lekar bhi asamanjas kii sthiti bani hui he, or abhi tak iskaa faisla nahin ho paaya he ki loksabhaa main congress kaa netaa koun hoga? piel puniya kehete hai ki sadan kaa netaa chunane ke liye abhi samay he
 Sonia Gandhi, the leader of our Parliamentary Party, will complete this work
 puniya kehete hai, 'mujhe vishwaas he ki vipakshi dalon ke netaa ek saath aaenge or loksabhaa main raashtra hit ke muddon ko uthaaenge
 Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh of Aam Aadmi Party says that AAP has three members in Rajya Sabha and one member in Lok Sabha
 hamaari sthiti bhale hi endie se kamjor he lekin ham use itnaa aasaani se nahin jane denge
 He said that we will raise questions on all the issues like economic slowdown, unemployment, agrarian crisis and drought situation in the country
 vakya bihar chunaav ke nateezon se pehle kaa he
 BJP national president Amit Shah was saying something in his mind to his special warlords, "in the states where we have a government, the chief minister's rubber stamp should not be the state president because it ruins the organization
" '' lekin bihar chunaav ke vipareet nateezon ne shah kii is manshaa ko prabhavit kiya he
 According to sources, when some senior party officials met Shah in the week following the defeat, his confidence was shaken and he was collecting information on every nuance before taking any decision
 lekin ranneeti main badlaav ko lekar manthan 10 november kii marathon baithak se baahar niklaa, jab shah ne sangh se aae purnakalik sanghathanaatmak prabhariyon ke saath paanch ghante tak aagaamee ranneeti par charchaa kii or isaki pehali jhalak 21 november ko dikhi, jab party ne kendriya khel mantri sarbanand sonoval ko assam kaa pradesh adhyaksh or chunaav prabandhan samiti kaa pramukh banane kaa elaan kiya
 According to the sources, the agenda of the meeting of the organization ministers was mainly the progress of the organizational elections, but in the first discussion of Bihar's defeat was discussed
 isamen yah raay bani ki bhale loksabhaa chunaav ke baad chah rajyon main hue chunaav main chaar main party jiti ho or sirf do main haari ho, lekin bihar or dilli kii haar kaa alag sandesh he
 Now whether Shah remains president or not, the party will move towards a strategic change
 bijepi yah mahasoos kar rahi he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke chehre ko saamne rakhkar chunaav ladgaye kii ranneeti main badlaav kaa vakt aa gaya he
 It was also discussed in the meeting that even though the Chief Minister's candidate is not projected, the election should be fought entirely by advancing the state unit
 par sawaal he ki kya shah is agenda ko assam se aage uttar pradesh or punjab main bhi badhayenge? pehali kadi main bihar kii haar kaa tatkaal prabhaav assam ko lekar party kii sakriyata se dikh rahaa he, jab pehali baar modi sarkaar ke kaabina mantri ko waapas pradesh kii kaman saunpi gai he
 Sonowal was the president of the Assam BJP even before he became a minister and he does not have a long history with the BJP
 ve 1992-99 tak ol assam students union ke adhyaksh rahe or phir 2011 main bijepi main shaamil hone se pehle tak assam gana parishad ke saath rahe hai
 But his popularity is considerable in the state
 isliye jab shah ne do maheene pehle rajya main sattadhari congress ke varisht netaa hemanth biswa sarama ko party main shaamil kiya to sonoval isse naaraaz the
 However, in charge of Assam BJP Mahendra Singh talks to India Today and refuses to link the appointment of Sonowal to the Bihar election defeat
 ve kehete hai, ''sanghathan main yah bahut pehle se tay tha
 His image is very good and there was a demand of workers about him
 ab ham assam ko aatank or congress mukt rajya banaaenge, yahaan kii janata ne bahut dalon ko avasar diya he or ab assam ko number ek rajya banane ke liye bijepi ko mauka degi
 Regarding the electoral preparedness of the state BJP, Mahendra Singh says that the organizational structure of booths to 36 districts has been prepared in all 126 assembly constituencies
 sthaneey nikaay chunaav main party kii jeet utsahjanak he
 Not only this, in the membership drive, Assam has achieved a target of 28 lakhs against the target of 25 lakhs, and is the first to reach 22 percent in the mass campaign
 udhar uttar pradesh main mukaable ko behad kathin maanakar chal rahi bijepi bihar kii tarah se chehre ko lekar duvidha main he
 Om Prakash Mathur, UP BJP in-charge and national vice-president, says, "as in-charge, i am of the opinion that we should go to collective leadership, but the Parliamentary Board will take the final decision, we will follow up on that
" '' lekin bihar kii haar se upi par asar yaa phir rajya ikai ko tarjeeh dene kii sambhaavna par maathur kii daleel he, ''main kisi said effect se prabhavit hokar na ranneeti banaata hum or na hi koi badlaav karata hum, main jo bhi kaam karata hum vah dirghakaalik ranneeti ke tahat hota he
 "BJP has put workers to work by multiplying the paper of up's election preparation at the organization level
" lekin pradesh adhyaksh ko lekar dharmpal singh, swatantradev singh, ramashankar katheria, manoj sinha, mahendra singh samet aadha darjan se zyada daavedaar hai or sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he ki is niyukti main bihar kii haar se sabak jarur hoga
 The high command will also take care of the sentiments of the workers like Assam
 isi tarah punjab main aam aadmi party ke badhate kadam se chintit bijepi sadhi hui chaal chal rahi he
 Leaders of bjp's Punjab unit believe that the party will lose badly by going into the alliance
 isliye sthaneey ikai lambey samay se akali dal (badal) se gathbandhan todakar akele chunaav main jane kii pakshdhar rahi he
 But on the question of giving preference to the opinion of the state unit, Punjab BJP President Kamal Sharma says, "BJP is a national party and Modi ji is our natural face
 vaise bhi punjab ke chunaav abhi dur hai or is bare main jo bhi faisla hoga, vah kendriya netritv ko lenaa he
 "but apart from Sharma's plea, the local unit has come to the Delhi court several times and requested to break the alliance with the Akali Dal
" bijepi ke kuch anya netaaon kaa maananaa he ki punjab main jis tarah se akali dal or badal parivaar kii chhavi kharaab hui he or aap kaa prabhaav badha he, usamen saath chunaav laduya aatmghaatee kadam hoga
 But other than these electoral states, the challenge to the central leadership is also seen from the party-ruled states
 madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan kii mukhyamantri apni pasand ke maujuuda adhyakshon ko hi dobaaraa kaman saunpane ke mood main hai, jabaki sthaneey virdohi khemaa virodh kar rahaa he
 The meeting of the core group on 25 November in this regard in Chhattisgarh was very tense
 sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he ki is baar mukhyamantri raman singh apni pasand yani maujuuda adhyaksh dharam laal kowshik ko dohraane kii jid par adte hai to aam taur par bijepi kii sarvasammati kii parampara tuutegi, bhale virdohi kheme kii haar kyon na ho
 Similarly, in Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan also wants the coronation of Nand Kumar Chauhan, but the opposing camp and the central leadership itself are not considered in this favor
 sutron kii maane to shah kii pasand kailash vijayawargeey ho sakate hai, lekin isamen sangh kii raay kaaphi had tak myne rakhegi
 While Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje wants to reward the current president Ashok Parnami for his strong defense in Lalitgate (scandal)
 lekin sutron kii maane to rajya ke sanghathanaatmak prabharee rashtriya sanyukt sanghathan mantri ve
 Satish is unhappy that the Chief Minister's residence (13 CMR) in Jaipur has become the center of both the power-organization, while she is a supporter of the parallel center
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki nnya in teenon rajyon main mukhyamantriyon kii chalegi yaa shah apni pasand ko thope paaenge
 The control of the center is natural in the organization, but as a senior leader of the organization points out, after the defeat of Bihar, it is now certain that the states will also have full power
 china ne iran se apil kii he ki vah sanyukt raashtra kapermanunirikshakon ke saath sahyog kare
 However, China refused to criticize Iran for refusing recent requests for information and refusing to visit sensitive sites
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa hong lee ne kaha ki iran ko or adhik baatcheet ke liye taiyaar hona chahie auratehranevam antarrashtriya samudaay ke bich kii vaarta ke sakaaratmak rukh ko barkaraar rakhana chahie
 With the call of the Lok Sabha elections, the game of political change of politicians is going to start in Uttar Pradesh, which is considered to be the most important politically
 kuch rajaneta tikat katane ke kaaran, to kuch ne apane vartmaan dal se haar kii ashanka ke chalate duusare dalon main thor talashna shuru kar diya he
 There are many mps in Uttar Pradesh who are not expecting a repeat win from their current party
 aise main unhone duusare dalon kaa darwaja khatkhataana shuru kar diya he
 There are many mps for whom their parties have accepted that they will not be able to take their seats this time
 apana tikat katane kii ashanka main ye saansad duusare dalon se apana rishta kaayam karne kii koshish main lag gaye hai

 He met top BSP leaders a few days ago and claimed a ticket from his current seat
 sapa ne yahaan se maujuuda saansad kaa tikat katkar purv saansad ko pratyaashee banaaya he
 After cutting the ticket from the SP, this leader, who was trying to get tickets from another party, said on condition of anonymity that he won the last Lok Sabha election and this time there is a strong possibility of his victory
 kaaryakarta bhi paksh main hai, lekin party netritv ne andekhi karke unka tikat kaat diya

 Yes, it would have been done for him in the BJP, but from the same area, the party is preparing to field its Fire Brand leader Varun Gandhi
 is vajah se abhi koi nirnay nahin ho paa rahaa he
 They can be contested from another seat nearby

 This leader is believed to be getting a BJP ticket from Amla, as the current MP from Amla, Maneka Gandhi, has discussions to contest from his traditional seat Pilibhit
 bundelkhand ke ek congressi vidhayak bhi loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai, lekin aalaa kaman dwaara tikat na die jane ke mil rahe sanketon ke baad unhone sapa netritv se sampark saadhaa he
 The current Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) mps from Amroha and Hathras in western Uttar Pradesh feel that they will not be able to win on their party ticket in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 isliye unhone sapa kaa daaman tham liya
 The SP has also announced the ticket of one of these women mps
 pradesh congress ke netaa subodh shrivastav kehete hai ki party netritv kisi vartmaan saansad kaa tikat kaatane se pehle vibhinn pahaluon par vichaar karne ke saath paanch saal main us netaa dwaara kiye gaye vikaas kaaryon ko lekar sthaneey netaaon se vichaar-vimarsh karata he
 It is true that every political party wants to win more and more seats, so why would it re-nominate a leader who has not been in the public for five years and his chances of winning are slim

 IIFA aword ke liye bollywood sitare back pack karne neuyork ke liye ravaanaa ho rahe hai
 This glamorous award event, which is going to start from July 14, will not be wrong if it is called the biggest event of Bollywood
 chote stars se lekar bade stars se sajane vaale is event se is baar bhi bachchan parivaar gaayab rahegaa
 After all, why the Bachchan family does not become a part of this event
 vajah khaas he aaie jaane
 There was a time when Amitabh Bachchan was the brand ambassador of IIFA at the IIFA Awards, called the most glamorous award event in the Bollywood industry
 lekin 2010 main amitabh bachchan or unke puure parivaar ne IIFA ko bycott karne kaa faisla kar liya

 chaaron taraf vyapam ghotaale kaa shor tha
 Millions of people were yearning for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to open his lips on this bloody scam of Madhya Pradesh before embarking on a five-nation tour to Central Asia
 lekin aisa kuch nahin hua
 The next day at 10 am, the phone rang at the Chief Minister's residence in Shyamala Hills, Bhopal
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah duusari taraf line par the
 Talked to Shivraj Singh Chauhan for about five minutes
 aadhe ghante ke bheetar mukhyamantri ne patrakaron ko bula bheja or ghoshnaa kar di ki ve madhya pradesh hycourt se guzarish karenge ki vyapam ghotaale kii jaanch sibiai ko saunp di jaae
 Sometimes in every Chief Minister's life, such a moment comes when he has to take such decisions which create a stir in the politics
 lekin satta ke sheersh par ek dashak puraa karne ja rahe 56 varshiya shivaraj ne un kuch ghanton kii siyaasi uthaa-patake ke baad ek aisa faisla liya jo barason main gadhi gai unki paak-saaf chhavi ko mitti main milane se kuch had tak bachaane kii unki aakhri koshish thi
 It is also a fact that in the most horrific scam in medical admissions and government recruitment so far, Shivraj has not been directly stained nor has any case been filed against him
 kam se kam abhi tak to ve is tarah range haath nahin pakade gaye hai ki ek or rajnatik shakhsiyat ke patan kaa jashn manaaya ja sake
 But the deaths in Vyapam created an atmosphere where there was no hearing of Chauhan's arguments
 ant main unke paas iske alaava koi chaara nahin tha ki ve maamle kii jaanch ek aisi bahari agency ke haath main jane den, jo siyaasi hawaaon kaa rukh bhaanpane main maahir maani jaati he
 But if Shivraj, who has come out from the small village of Sehore and reached the peak of power, will stop and reverse the calendar of scams, he will find himself responsible for the birds to pay the farm
 or tab ve is ehsaas se sihar uthenge ki kahin unhone apane kariyar main palitha to nahin laga liya
 India Today investigates that between 2008 and 2013, there were many occasions where Shivraj, who talked without looking at him, ate a bottle
 sanad rahe, 2008 se 2012 ke bich vyavsaayik pariksha mandal (vyapam) ko niyantrit karne vaala swasthya shiksha vibhaag unheen ke paas tha
 Despite this, as the number of Vyapam deaths increased, he kept on thumping, saying that he was himself the real 'whistleblower' who exposed Vyapam, after all, he was the responsibility of investigating Vyapam in 2013
 Work force (STF)
 lekin mukhyamantri kii is 'maasoom' daleel kii kaat bhi kam nahin hai
 For example, Paras Saklecha, a former Independent MLA from Ratlam and author of the book Vyapam Mahaghotala, reminds that he had already raised the matter in the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly in July 2009
 agar yaad na ho to mukhyamantri khud vidhansabha kii kaarywahi ke record khangaal len
 On the other hand, the government doctor and Whistleblower of the case Dr
 anand raay bataate hai ki unhone to 6 july, 2009 ko hi piemti main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat indore krime branch main kar di thi
 It is not that the government is not aware of these things
 shikaayatein milane ke baad rajya sarkaar ne 17 disambar, 2009 ko police dal se maamle kii jaanch karne ko kaha tha
 After this, on 31 March 2011, Chauhan himself told the Legislative Assembly that the Vyapam scam was under investigation
 us saal july or november main unhone phir yahi baat sadan main doharaai or duusari baar unhone kaha tha ki 114 sandigdh chaatro kii pahchaan kar exiar darj kara di gai he
 But what spoiled the Vyapam scam
 aankade bataate hai ki idhar police kachua chaal se jaanch karti rahi or udhar ghotaale kaa sand tagada hota gaya
 Vyapam documents show that where 42 medical admissions had to be canceled in 2008 due to fraud, 85 in 2009, 90 in 2010, 98 in 2011, 286 in 2012 and 439 in 2013 were canceled
 2014 main to sarkaar ne pariksha radd kar apni laaj bachaai
 Dr
 raay tanj kasate hai, ''sarkaar ghotaale kii jaanch nahin kar rahi thi, vah to ghotalebaajon ko sangrakshan de rahi thi
 Chauhan was also accused of taking care of relatives
 jab unki bhanji ritu chouhan empipiessi-2008 pariksha paas kar dipti colector ban gayi, to congress ko isamen sajeesh kii bu ai
 Madhya Pradesh Congress spokesperson K
K
 ke
 Mishra reminds, "when i raised this issue in 2011, instead of investigating the matter, the Chief Minister sent a message to me that dragging the family in politics is not a good thing
" '' jahaan sarkaar kaa kahana he ki empipiessi ek swytta sanstha he or iske kaamkaaj main bahari dakhal nahin diya jaataa, vahiin mishra kaa daawa he ki ritu ko phayda pahunchane ke liye niyamon main badlaav kiya gaya
 He says that he had filed an RTI application several times to get the exam copies and merit list, but the answer was not received
 pariksha kii kapiyaan 10 saal tak surakshit rakhane kaa niyam tha lekin niyamon ko 2011 se 2013 ke bich chah baar sanshodhit kiya gaya
 Finally, after three months, the documents related to Ritu were deleted, making provision to destroy the copies of the examination
 chouhan kii patni sadhana singh kaa naam bhi ghotaalon main uchhaala gaya
 The Congress alleged that in the Transport Constable Recruitment Examination 2012, 17 people of Sadhana's native district Gondia (maharashtra) were recruited by giving fake addresses of Madhya Pradesh
 yahi nahin, pehle jahaan 198 bhartiyon kaa vigyaapan nikaala gaya, vahiin baad main 332 bhartiyon kar lee gayi
 It is also worth noting that cases were later registered against 39 people on charges of rigging and 17 people allegedly being told of Gondia were not allowed to join the job
 pariksha ke andeh ke ghere main aane or gambhir aarope lagane ke baavjood kisi kii himmat sadhana singh se poochtacha karne kii nahin hui
 In a special conversation with India Today in July 2014, Chauhan said, "the opposition wants to dismantle my statue
" mere khilaaf jab congress ko kuch nahin mila to ve meri patni or bhanji kaa jhootha maamla ghaseet laae
 Similarly, fingers were also raised about Premchand Prasad, the then private secretary of Chauhan, who was accused of wrongly admitting his daughter in PMT 2012
 maamla darj hone ke baavjood unase kabhi sakhti se poochtacha nahin kii gai or unhone aasaani se 21 june, 2014 ko agrim jamaanat le lee
 The Congress accuses him of wrongly recruiting 200 more people besides his daughter
 virdohi kyon choden haath aayaa maukaghotaale ke thapedo se jujh rahe shivaraj aaj pehle se kahin kamjor netaa hai
 Today, facing the face of TV cameras with artificial confidence, they must have wondered how fast the image of 'mama ji' that was created on the lines of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's 'chacha Nehru' image is being rapidly eroded
 ghotaale kii maar padane ke baad party ne unki mukhyamantri kii kursi to baksh di, lekin haisiyat gata di
 By the way, his political opinion in the state had gone to a critical time before the high command
 tabhi to pradesh ke grih mantri babulal gaur ne tapaak se kaha ki ghotaale kii koi file unki ankhon ke saamne se nahin guzarati
 The elderly leader said that his advice was also not taken in the decision not to challenge the High Court's decision to abolish the FIR lodged against the governor in the Vyapam scam
 udhar, chouhan ke udai ke baad pradesh se rajnatik nirvaasan jhel raheen kendriya mantri uma bharti ne bhi beete dinon kaa hisaab chuktaa karne main der nahin lagaai
 He told India Today TV, "I am afraid that someday my flag might fly off
 madhya pradesh main police vaale meraa peechha karte hai
 "on the other hand, the Congress worries that when all the UPA governors were removed unnecessarily, why did tainted Yadav become so close to Modi?" Chauhan always took a soft stand in the matter of removing the governor
 is mudde par, bujurgon ke liye tirth darshan yojana shuru karne vaale, shivaraj kii daleel he ki unhone 86 saal ke yadav ke girte swasthya ko dekhte hue samvedansheel rukh apanaaya
 Vyapam's accused son, Shailesh, has been keeping up and down since his suspected death in March this year
 vaise, madhya pradesh main shivaraj kaa jansamarthan pehle kabhi kam nahin rahaa
 That is why in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, the Congress, which has cleaned the state of Madhya Pradesh, feels that it has to be done now, because it rarely gets a good chance to turn public sentiments towards itself
 party ne 16 july ko rajyavyapee band kaa aahvaan kiya he
 In the towns and cities, Congress workers are taking out processions and shouting 'mama-mami, hi-hi'

 lekin chouhan kaa bhavishya ab is baat par nirbhar he ki indore ke visaladbralovar prashanth pandeya ne jo excel shit adaalat ko saunpi he, vah kitni bharosemand he
 Pandey claims that Vyapam's mastermind Nitin Mohendra had written the name of the Chief Minister in the original Excel sheet at the 48th place, but even before reaching STF, Indore Crime Branch tampered with the excel sheet, replacing Uma Bharti, Governor and many more Wrote the minister's name instead
 in aaropon par bijepi kaa ghisapita tark he ki pandeya congress ke agent hai
 However, after making a similar accusation on another Whistleblower Anand Rai, the BJP became like a snake-snatch when Rai revealed that he had been a committed RSS volunteer
 vaise pandeya kaa daawa he ki unki excel shit na sirf puri tarah sahi he, balki ve bengalooru ke pratishthit truth lab se isaki satyata pramanit bhi kara chuke hai
 Pandey had earlier also released the details of the alleged SMS dialogue between Sadhana Singh and Vyapam accused Sudhir Singh
 in esemes main mukhyamantri kii patni kathith taur par vyapam main sellection ke liye pratiyogiyon ke naam forward kar rahi hai
 STF has so far rejected these SMS saying that they have been obtained wrongly, hence, they are not worth considering in the investigation
 vaise, jab tak jaanch police ke haath main thi, tab tak isaki aanch kisi bhi rup main shivaraj kii choukhat tak nahin fatki
 But now that the Supreme Court has handed over the investigation to the CBI, their fate is in the balance
 agar sibiai prashanth pandeya ke saakshyon ko sahi maan leti he to nishchit taur par shivaraj ke liye saare raste band ho jaaenge
 By the way, Supreme Court lawyer Virag Gupta believes, "the process of transferring all cases from STF to CBI can take six months to one year
" '' iske alaava vyapam kii mauton ke maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko alag-alag thanon se apane paas leni hogi
 That is, Shivraj has little time in which he will try to repair the image
 is baat par bhi najar rakhni hogi ki party ne shivaraj kii kismat likhane kaa faisla pradhanmantri ke desh se baahar jane ke baad sunaaya
 But neither Modi can stay abroad forever nor does Chauhan have any cover to hide the stains

 With the decision of the Election Commission on Samajwadi Party, it has become clear that the Mulayam era in SP is over and now it will be the responsibility of Akhilesh Yadav to take the party forward
 party or uske chunaav chinh par kabje ko lekar jo ghamaasan pichley kuch maheenon main dekhne ko mila uski pariniti mulaayam singh yadav ke haashiye par chale jane ke rup main hui he
 In such a situation, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav himself will be the biggest star campaigner of the party in the assembly elections
 unke baad unki patni or kannauj se saansad dimple yadav kii bhoomika chunaav prachaar main kaaphi ahm hogi
 Dimple Yadav, Lok Sabha MP from Dimpalkannauj, who has gained enough experience in politics, has done 39 years two days ago
 akhilesh yadav se unki shaadi ko puure 17 saal ho chuke hai
 Her entry into politics was in 2009 when the Samajwadi Party fielded her as a candidate for the Firozabad seat left by her husband Akhilesh Yadav
 haalanki dimple ye mahatvapurn chunaav haar gayi lekin teen saal baad 2012 main vidhansabha chunaav ladane ke liye jab akhilesh ne kannauj seat bhi chhod di to vahaan se dimple nirvirodh jeetne main safal raheen
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Dimple managed to save her seat of Kannauj even when the opposition's vote bank was being blown in the storm of Modi all over UP
 unhone bijepi ke subrat pathak ko takreeban 20 hajaar voton ke antar se haraaya
 This time the responsibility of Dimple will increase, for Akhilesh Yadav, this time the election is completely different from the previous elections
 is baar ve na sirf mukhyamantri balki sapa ke kartadharta ke rup main chunaav maidan main utar rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is believed that after Akhilesh, the star campaigner of the party will be Dimple Yadav
 kaaryakarta abhi se 'vikaas kii chaabi-dimple bhabhi' jaise naare garh rahe hai
 Dimple Yadav has also been involved in campaigning in the past
 lekin abhi tak ve parivaar kii bahu ke role main zyada dikhi hai
 Since this time Akhilesh's election campaign is going to be more of a one-man show, it will be the responsibility of Dimple Yadav to conduct election meetings in favor of the party where Akhilesh will not be able to go

 The special thing with Dimple is that he is not out of politics like Priyanka but is fully active in SP
 unhen chunaav ladane kaa bhi acha khaasaa anubhav hasil he or mahilaon se jude muddon par unhone kai baar apni baat saarvajanik rup se rakhi he
 priyanka-dimple's simultaneous rally could prove to be a game changer, Congress's alliance with Akhilesh Yadav is believed to be fixed
 congress lagaataar sanket de rahi he ki is baar chunaavon main priyanka kaa role pehle ke mukaable zyada vyapak hoga
 If this happens, Dimple and Priyanka can rally together
 donon kaa ek manch par jutana bheed jutaney ke lihaaj se itnaa mahatvapurn daanv hoga jisaki kaat khojna vipakshi bijepi or bispi ke liye khaasaa mushkil hoga
 Dimple's image will affect young, rural and female voters

 lekin fasebuk par mukhyamantri pad se hatane kii baat likhane se pehle anandiben patel ne somvaar subah hi apana istipha party adhyaksh amit shah ko bhej diya tha
 Antiben Patel, who was expected to withdraw from the party since 2015, wrote that he had asked the leadership to step down as Chief Minister 2 months ago
 kyonki anandiben patel is saal november main 75 saal kii hone vaali hai

 kyonki 25 agast 2015 ko patidaaron ke andolan ke baad se hi ye kayaas lagaae ja rahen the anandiben patel ko mukhyamantri ke pad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 But PM Modi had stopped the removal of Anandiben Patel as Chief Minister at that time

 5: Increase party participation in government decisions
 6:kendriya netritv ko samay-samay par party or sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kii samiksha kerani hogi
 Read: Anandiben Patel's mind, given these 5 reasons, resigning from the post of Chief Minister, if you are afraid of loss in the 2017 assembly elections, then at that time, Om Mathur had clearly told PM Modi and party president Amit Shah based on the report that if If Anandiben Patel is not removed in time, the party may suffer big losses in the November 2017 Gujarat assembly elections
 bas uske baad se hi piem modi ne anandiben kii vidaai ke liye upyukt samay kii talash shuru kar di thi

 Had PM Modi not yet taken the decision on Anandiben Petal, then the party would have suffered damages in Gujarat elections and his leadership would have been questioned
 jo piem modi kii chhavi ke liye acha nahin hota
 That is why those who know PM Modi say that Modi is very sensitive about his image

 unka maananaa he ki film main samalangik sambandhon ko mahima mandan vaale tareeke se dikhaaya gaya he
 The film depicts nudity depicting important parts of a man's body through paintings in close shots
 film main hindu dharm ko avmaananaa vaale dhang se dikhaaya gaya he
 Especially the way (vulgar depiction) of Lord Hanuman is mentioned, there can be law and order problem in the society
 film main samalangikta ko dikhaane vaale poster hai or mahilaon ke khilaaf bhi avmaananaa vaali tippaniyan hai
 The film has references to Hindu organizations which are undesirable
 'teen yuvaaon par aadhaarit he kahani'co bodyscaps' teen yuvaaon kii kahani he jo ruudhivaadee shahar main rahete hue apane liye jagah or khushi dhundne kii jaddojahad karte hai

 On December 2, 2016, the Kerala High Court had asked the CBFC to give the filmmaker a chance to modify the film or remove it from the film

 What does the CEO of CBFC have to say? According to CBFC CEO Anurag Srivastava, the second revisiting committee in Mumbai saw the film in Mumbai in February following the High Court's direction
 film mechashleelata, samalangikta kaa mahima mandan, hindu dharm ko avmananapurna tareeke se dikhaaya gaya he
 Srivastava said, 'I did not see the film but it is necessary to be satisfied on the reasons given by the members of the Revising Committee panel
 saaf he ki dishanirdeshon ke kuch praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan hua he
 Homosexuality is not the only issue but many more guidelines have also been violated
 shrivastav ke mutabik filmkaar ke saamne kanoonee raste khule hai
 If he had already gone to the tribunal, that would have been the right path
 ab bhi wo tribunel ke paas ja sakate hai
 If he is still not satisfied then he can go to court
 ye nahin kaha ja saktaa ki film kabhi relies nahin hogi
 Srivastava said, 'it is wrong to say that most films are not being given certificates or filmmakers have to go to the High Court
 ham saal main agar 2000 filmon ko certificate dete hai
 Few films face such a situation, everything else is passed
 pehlaaj nihlani ne kaha, jo filmein paas hone laayak nahin, paas nahin hongisibiefasi ke adhyaksh pehlaaj nihlani ne 'kaa bodyscaps' ko lekar kuch kehane se inkaar kar diya

 Mamta Kale said that there are some specific guidelines regarding films which should be respected
 ye samvedansheel mudda he, dharmik charitron ko dikhaate hue satarkta baratani chahie
 Do not show anything in the movies that hurts the sentiments of any class: Raza Murad: Actor Raza Murad is of the opinion that before putting a finger on the censor board it should be thought that the censor board has to follow certain guidelines
 unheen ke anusaar film ko certificate dena hota he
 Raza Murad said that if he shows lesbian, transgender or gay in films then it should not be something that hurts any section of society

 'acchhee kahani ne jimi ko 'mukkaabaz' or 'sahib bivi or gangster' kii siries main kaam karne ke liye prerit kiya
 If he wants to do a film with Gulzar again, Anurag is ready to work in any of Kashyap's films

 Anant Hegde, who was in the news due to his statements, has also been discharged from the Cabinet this time
 samvidhan badalane kii baat ho yaa phir twitor par nathuram godse kaa samarthan anant hegade kaa badbolapan lagata he unpar baari pad gaya
 Anant Hegde, who won the re-election from Uttara Kannada in Karnataka, was known for making controversial statements in the first term of the Modi government
 pichhali sarkaar main vah kaushal vikaas mantralay main rajya mantri rahe
 His statement of changing the constitution after the formation of the government last time put the BJP in trouble
 agar taaja maamla uthaaen to chunaav nateezon se thik pehle unhone ek twit kiya tha
 In his tweet, he described the discussion on Nathuram Godse, the killer of Mahatma Gandhi, as enjoyable
 tab sadhvi pragna singh thakur ne nathuram ko deshbhakt bataaya tha or anant hegade ne unka samarthan kiya tha
 Anant Hegde wrote about Nathuram Godse, 'I am happy that after almost 7 decades, today's generation is discussing this issue with new changes
 is charchaa ko sun aaj nathuram godse acha mahasoos kar rahe honge‚Äô
 However, after the controversy, he said that his account was hacked
 lekin lagata he ki ye hi bayaan unke liye mushkil kaa kaaran ban gaya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given the message only after the victory that this time, whoever is a leader of bigotry should pay attention
 piem ne kaha tha ki unki party main kuch namoonay aise hai, jo subah-subah uthakar raashtra ke naam sandesh dete hai
 What did he say about the constitution? In 2017, he made a statement that the BJP will soon change the constitution, which has the word 'secular' written on it
 tab unhone kaha tha ki kuch log kehete hai ki samvidhan kahata he ki ham secular hai isliye ise tumhen maananaa hi padegaa, ham samvidhan kaa aadar karte hai, lekin samvidhan kai baar badla he or yah bhavishya main bhi badalegaa, humlog yahaan samvidhan badalenge
 But there was a lot of controversy over this statement, the opposition targeted fiercely at the Modi government
 jiske kuch samay baad hi unhen maafee maangani padi thi
