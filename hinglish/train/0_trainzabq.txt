 It is not that Raipur has no equivalent of five-star hotels and no other government buildings
 yahaan bhavy air condishan haul or suvidhaon vaale bhawan or auditorium khaali pade he, lekin chunaav ayog ko five star hotel hi raas aayaa
 Therefore, the meetings of the officials associated with the election work were settled here, but some more people came to this Five Star Hotel who did not like the wasteful expenditure of the Election Commission

 According to local citizen Sanjay Pandey, the Election Commission should take care of public money
 unke mutabik paanch sitara hotel main kisi raajnneetik dal kaa jalsa samaj main aata he, lekin chunaav ayog kaa nahin
 On the other hand, when senior Election Commissioner Umesh Sinha from Delhi asked the purpose of meeting at the Five Star Hotel, journalists started looking into the armpits
 unhone ise rajya sarkaar kii vyavastha bataakar apana pallaa jhaad liya
 However, he admitted that instead of Five Star Hotel, the meeting could have taken place elsewhere
 aamtaur par chunaav ayog raajnneetik dalon ko anaavashyak chunavi kharchon par roak lagane or tay rakam ke bheetar hi chunavi kharch nipataane kii naseehat detaa he
 The supervisor is also appointed to keep a check on ill-gotten use of funds, but when the turn comes, priority is given to five-star hotels rather than government buildings
 is maamle main ayog kaa apana tark he
 Officers are required to issue tenders and tenders for the expenditure of more than forty thousand rupees from the government coffers, so that government money can be saved through competition
 lekin is maamle main aisa nahin hua
 The Election Commission called the meeting directly at the Five Star Hotel without adopting the official procedure

 bihar main ek dalit ke ghar main kendriya rajya mantri kaa bhojan karnaa vivaadon main aa gaya he
 It is alleged that the food which was eaten by the Union Minister of State SS Ahluwalia in the house of a Dalit in Begusarai, was prepared by a cook outside (halwai)
 is par vivaad badhane baad ab ahaluwalia ne safai di he
 He argued what was the reason behind doing so
 ahaluwaliane news agency eenai se kaha - ek mahila ghar main 200-300 logon kaa khaanaa kaise pakaa sakati he, aise main gaanv main ek cook he jo khaas maukon par gaanvvaalon kaa khaanaa banaata he
 He said, why is this issue being made an issue? In Begusarai, Bihar, Ahluwalia was accused that food was ordered for him from outside
 ahaluwalia ne dalit ke ghar sabji, chaaval-daal, papad kaa jaayaka liya tha
 All villages have a cook & they are the ones to cook on occasions as a woman cannot cook for 200-300 ppl
 Why is an issue being made? Why isn't emotion behind eating there being looked at?: Minister SS Ahluwalia on reports of him eating food from outside at a Dalit householdpic

 When i serve food with my hands to a Dalit, then my house will be blessed

 com / drprncd89d With the end of the election campaign in Karnataka, the voters now have a full day on Friday to calmly make up their mind as to which candidate to vote for on May 12
 prachaar beshak khatm ho gaya lekin soshal media par aisi koi roak nahin he
 On all social media platforms, supporters of various parties keep fighting these 'political battles' till the end of the election
 karnataka main matdaan ko ab kuch hi vakt bachaa he, aise main soshal media se jude networks par ek sansanikhej chitthee fail rahi he
 It is also being circulated in the whatsapp group
 chitthee main jo likhaa gaya he wo sampradayik aadhaar par bahut uksaane vaala he
 According to the letter, the Catholic Church and the ruling Congress government in Karnataka secretly worked together to make Lingayat a separate minority religion
 chitthee main ek kathith rodmap kaa daawa bhi kiya gaya he jiske mutabik lingayat samudaay ko pehle hinduon se alag karnaa or phir unka catholic isai ke rup main dharm parivartan karana tha
 The date of 23 March 2018 is recorded on the letter
 ise catholic bishap conference of india (CBCI) ke adhyaksh hiz aminence oswald cardinal gracius kii ore se likhaa gaya bataaya gaya he
 The letter is shown sending to the name of Archbishop Bangalore Dr
 Bernard Moras
 chitthee ke mutabik '21 disambar 2013 ko dilli se 'holi si' ke pratinidhiyon ne karnataka ke sattarudh netritv se pehali baar mulaakaat kii or lingayat ko alag dharm kaa darja dene kii maang ko lekar dabaav daalaa
 After this, several meetings were held between the representatives of the 'holy See' and the Karnataka government
 ' bataa den ki 'holi si' kaa sambodhan pope ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It has also been said in the letter, 'we must work hard for a rich harvest of souls in Karnataka
 ' chitthee main aage kaha gaya he, 'lingayat main paith banane ke liye ham lingayat aasthaa kii khub prashansa kar sakate hai lekin catholic ko ye kabhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki kisi bhi aadhyatmik maapdand ke mutabik lingayat catholic aasthaa ke baraabar nahin ho sakate or moksh sirf catholic hone se hi mil saktaa he
 In the form of an email, this letter has been posted on Facebook and Twitter by many people with a inclination towards right
 inamen swami nishchalanand bhi shaamil hai
 Then many people can also be seen expressing anger in response to these posts
 ye kehete bhi ki catholic carch kii ore se ye hinduon ko baantne or phir unhen isai dharm main parivartit karaane kii sajeesh he
 The letter has been drafted in such a way that it looks like a real dialogue between two key officials of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India
 lekin chitthee ke saavdhaanee se nirikshan se saaf ho jaataa he ki ye koi li chitthee nahin balki farji chitthee he jise karnataka chunaav kii purvasandhya par matadaataaon kaa dhruvikaran kar chunavi phayda uthaane ke mansoobey se circulet kiya ja rahaa he
 There is a lot of evidence regarding the letter which questions its credibility
 masalan-1
 The letter His Eminence Oswald is written by Cardinal Gracias, who is the president of the CBCI
 lekin chitthee ko jis email se bheja gaya dikhaaya he wo secretarygeneral@cbci
 in which is the email of the Secretary General of CBCI
 aisa koi kaaran nahin he ki adhyaksh ko secretary general kaa email kaa istemaal karnaa pade wo bhi aise mahatvapurn aadhikarik samvaad ke liye
 2
 aam taur par is tarah kii chitthiyaan aadhikarik letters pad par likhi jaati hai or unke neeche bhejne vaale ke dastakhat bhi hote hai or unhen email ke saath atachament ke taur par bheja jaataa he
 These three things are not in the above mentioned letter
 3
 The format of the above email is different from emails sent from this email id
 pushti ke liye hamane CBCI ke secretary general theodor masahrenhas se sampark kiya to unke isi email se kuch forward hokar email aae
 Their format was different from the fake letter format
 farji chitthee kaa formet tha-“ Date: 2018-03-23” 10
 30 GMT + 0530 ”whereas the format of the mail from the original mail was like this
 “ Sent: Tuesday, February 13, 2018 5:19 PM”

 farji chitthee main angreji vartanee kii kai galtiyaan hai
 There is very little chance that the organization itself should not be written properly in the official letter of the President of Catholic Bishops' Conference of India
 farji chitthee main apostrophe (') kaa istemaal galat jagah kiya gaya he
 It is spelled Bishop's
 (jabaki ye Bishops’ hona chahie tha)5
 There are many more mistakes in fake letters
 jaise ki- press urge them ( sahi istemaal nahin), rip rich harvest (sahi he reap rich harvest), persue (jabaki sahi persuade hona chahie)
 The article 'the' is also missing in many places in the letter
 chitthee ke shuru main ye CBCI ke adhyaksh kii ore se bheji dikhaai lagati he lekin aakhir main secretary general kii ore se bheji gai chitthee bataai gai he
 It is clear that whoever drafted the fake letter was mistaken about the names
 CBCI ne aisi koichittheelikhe jane se inkaar kiya he
 Also, it is written with fake and mischievous intent
 CBCI kii ore se kaha gaya he- ‘is chitthee ko karnataka chunaav se thik pehle failaana ghatiya or sharaarat bhari chaal he
 Whoever coined and spread this letter, we reserve the right to take legal action against them
 ham apane shubhachintakon se aagrah karte hai ki jab bhi aisi chitthee aapke paas aae to hamaare is aadhikarik spashtikaran se pratikriya darj karaaen
 God bless Karnataka
 ishwar hamaare priy desh bharat ko ashish de

 bijepi ke piem in vatting narendra modi ne bhrashtachar ke mudde par congress ko gherte hue kaha uske ghotaalon se desh kii garima ko thes pahunchi he
 He said at a rally in the capital Delhi that the UPA government is involved in the theft of even coal
 dwarka main raily main narendra modi ne congress par prahaar karte hue kaha ki ab tak congress ke kai chunaav chihn badal gaye
 Everything changed in that party, but intentions did not change
 unhone kaha ki upie sarkaar ekadam pangu ho gai he
 Modi blamed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the hugely rising inflation and said that he did not think it necessary to speak anything in front of the country on this issue
 unhone kaha ki mahangaai ke baavjood upie sarkaar garibon ke hit main koi kadam nahin uthaa rahi he
 Attacking Delhi's Sheila Dixit government, Modi said that the Commonwealth scam has brought the country's credibility to the world
 unhone kaha ki shila dikshit sarkaar ne dillivaasiyon ko pine kaa saaf pani tak nahin diya
 Referring to the cleanliness plan of the rivers, Modi exemplified that despite spending Rs 3900 crore, the Yamuna remained unhygienic, while the Sabarmati was completely cleaned for just Rs 900 crore
 modi ne janata se apil kii ki vah is chunaav main unka saath na de, jo 15 saalon se satta main to hai, lekin aam janata ke hit main kuch nahin kiya
 Justifying his claim for the post of PM, Modi said that when a common man attached to the land gets the responsibility, he wakes up day and night to find a solution to the problems of the country
 saath hi gandhi parivaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue modi ne kaha ki jo teen-teen pidhiyon se raaj kar rahe hai, par desh ke vikaas kii taraf dhyaan nahin de rahe hai, unhen janata chunaav main sabak sikhayegi
 Modi appealed to the people to remember a few things when they go to vote on the 4th
 yaad karen ki maujuuda dilli sarkaar nedilli ko 'rape capital' bana diya
 For Nirbhaya at India Gate, the young men were spending the night in the cold for safety, while cold water was showered on them
 ramlila maidan main raat ko logon par jurm karne liye police ko bheja jaataa he, police logon ko maarthi-peethti he or ek mahila kii maut ho jaati he
 Modi said in a very snappy way that before going to vote, bow to the gas cylinder, also pay the onion
 'shahjade' kii soch banaam modi kii sochanarendra modi is raily main bhi rahul gandhi par kataaksh karne se nahin chuke
 He said that Congress' 'prince' thought that India is a beehive, whereas our view is' India '
 unka vichaar he ki garibi man kii avasthaa he, jabaki garib hamaare liye daridranarayan he
 Their idea is that if we do not do politics of poverty, it is not fun
 hamaari soch he ki garib ke dukh-dard or pidaa se dukh hota he
 Modi said that 'shahzade' thinks that money does not grow on trees
 hamaari soch he ki paise khet or khalihaanon main ugte hai or majudar ke paseene se uskaa laalan-paalan hota he
 Their thinking is, break the society and rule
 hamaari soch he, samaaj ko jodo or vikaas karo
 His thinking is, politics is everything
 hamaari soch he rashtraniti sabakuch he
 Their thinking is, how to save power
 hamaari soch he, desh kaise bachaaen
 Modi said that he thought of Shahzade
 yahi soch he, jiske kaaran hindustan ne dekh liya he congress mukt bharat kaa sapana

 Gandhian activist Anna Hazare has questioned Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan's statement whether only those contesting elections can raise their voice against corruption
 gandhivadi kaaryakarta ne kaha, ‘ab yah kaha ja rahaa he ki anna ko chunaav ladanaa chahie
 Does this mean that whoever is speaking out against corruption will have to contest elections? If this is the case then 120 crore people of the country should stand in elections, only then they will be able to speak against corruption
 ’unhone kaha ki raajnneetikon ne chunaav ladaa he magar kisi ne bhrashtachar par lagaam lagane ke liye kuch bhi nahin kiya
 Hazare said, 'in the last 62 years, you have not made a law that can deal with corruption
 ’ gandhivadi kaaryakarta kii yah pratikriya chavaan ke us bayaan par aayi he jisamen unhone kaha ki yah ‘spasht’ he ki hajaare ke sahyogi raajnneeti main aana chaahate hai
 He asked them to come forward
 chavaan ne kaha tha, ‘agar aap raajnneeti main hissaa lenaa chaahate hai, aap isamen shaamil hon, raajnneeti samrudh hogi
 It is now clear that his colleagues want to enter politics
 ’ unhone kaha tha, ‘unhen ek spasht ruukh apnaanaa chahie yaa to vah chunaav laden yaa kisi kaa samarthan karen
 But there is no meaning of adopting a negative attitude that if the bill (jan Lokpal) is not passed then we will protest (oppose Congress)

 navandhuten sollu, thirumbi vandhuten (main waapas aa gaya hum, unhen bataa do main waapas aa gaya hum)'' rajnikant 2016 main ai hit film kabali main apane khaas andaaj main elaan karte hai
 He plays the role of Kabaliswaran who fights for Tamil laborers in Malaysia like Robinhood and voices social-political issues against the backdrop of hostility to gangs
 isamen daliton ke vidroh sahit rajnatik andolanon kaa zikr hota he
 The success of the film came at the right time for this superstar as Talaiva
 isse pehle 2010 main shankar ke nirdesan main vigyaan par aadhaarit kaalpanik kahani vaali unki film antiraan ne box offis par jabardast dhamal machaaya tha
 But the animated film Kochadaiyan (2016) directed by daughter beauty Rajinikanth and K
 es
 The superstar had to apologize to fans due to Ravikumar's Linga (2016) failure and he had also compensated the distributors for their losses
 tab atakalein lagaai jane lagi thim ki rajnikant teen dashak ke shandaar kariyar ke baad ab shaayad ritair ho sakate hai
 The interest of the Tamil audience was changing and Talaiwa had to sit quietly and think afresh
 dhamaakedaar vaapasi ke liye superstar ko kuch nayaa karne kii sakht jarurat thi
 He called for stories from young and senior filmmakers
 usee mode par 36 varshiya paa
 Ranjith enters, who made the successful political action film Madras in 2014
 kabhi nirdeshak venkat prabhu ke sahaayak rahe ranjit ne ek romantic kamedi attakati ke saath shuruyaat kii or siyaasi soch ke saath apni alag pahchaan bana lee
 He became a distinct Dalit identity who is an atheist and raises issues that are associated with Tamil Nadu and the entire Indian society
 rajnikant ke saath unki duusari film kaala he
 In this film, 67-year-old Rajinikanth plays Karikalan, a Tamil don living in Dharavi, Mumbai who fights for the rights of the poor
 kaale rang kii lungi pahan vah khaas andaaj main akadakar chalata he
 The black color of his choice is symbolic of the toiling class while Hari Dada (portrayed by Nana Patekar) in a villain-like role wears white clothes
 ranjit kehete hai, "karikaalan bas ek yaa do vaakya hi bolta he par puure aatmavishvaas ke saath
 "he explains," At times Rajinikanth refused to speak some dialogues and perform some scenes
 unhen lagata tha ki ve samvaad unke charitra se mail nahin khate the
 He said, "karikalan cannot do this
 '' or log mere upar aarope lagaate hai ki maine rajnikant ko dhamaakedaar samvaad nahin die
 The beauty of Ranjith's contact with Inception Superstar goes to Beauty, whom he met in 2010 on the sets of Venkat's film Goa
 isse pehle ve jaanate the ki ve is diggaj abhinayta ke liye film kii kahani likh rahe the
 Says Ranjith, "he had seen Madras and liked the film very much
 unhen mere kaam par bharosa tha
 "many things were completely new in Kabali
 ab tak badi umr ke kirdaar karne se bachate aa rahe rajnikant ne isamen ek buudhe aadmi kii bhoomika kii thi
 Ranjith says, "kabali was actually different from the rest of Rajinikanth's films
 usamen rajani ke bahut-se jane-pahachaane andaaj nahin the
 He had a young daughter in it and there was a color of politics in it
 unke prashansakon ko is film se ek jhatka sa laga tha
 He used to come to me and ask, "what did you do with Rajinikanth?" Kabali got mixed response but it was a big box office gross
 duusari parisuperstar ke saath apni duusari pari main ranjit pehle se zyada samajhadaar dikhte hai or zyada paripakv mudde uthaate hai
 He says, "this time i was conscious of the criticisms received by Rajinikanth's fans and wanted to do something different
 is baar main jameen ke adhikaron or jhuggi bastiyon ko khaali karne jaise zyada jwalanth muddon ko uthaanaa chahta tha, saath hi rajnikant ko darshakon ke saamne ek alag rup main pesh karnaa chahta tha
 He got the inspiration for this film from many things, including Anand Patwardhan's documentary Bombay Our City on the life of slum dwellers in 1985
 ranjit kehete hai, "mumbai kshaitij or oonchai kii ore badhata shahar he
 Horizontal disappears when height increases
 jin logon ko shahar ko sundar banane ke liye laayaa gaya tha, ve hi ab avaanchit ban gaye hai
 "ranjit spent six months walking around the slums and interacting with people to understand the problems here and the life here
" ve bataate hai, "main vahaan (mumbai) film kaa set bananaa chahta tha kyonki vahaan saanskrithik vividhta he
 i did not want to make it a Tamil film only

 So she would welcome it
 kasee tyaagi ke bayaan kaa sidhaa arth yah lagaaya ja rahaa he ki janata dal united kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil nahin hone ke apane stand par adig nahin he
 She wants to join the cabinet, but not on the basis of symbolic representatives, but on the demand for the old proportional representation of its national president Nitish Kumar

" There will be a reason for the current price
 agar khadi deshon main tanaav ke kaaran kachche tel ke daam main oochaal aata he to isse desh kii arthvyavastha kii raftaar or sust pad sakati he
 'it is worth mentioning that in the latest monthly economic report of the Finance Ministry itself, it has been accepted that the Indian economy in FY 2018-19 due to non-export target, private consumption is below expectations and soft growth in fixed investment
 The pace is slowing down

 Private consumption also declined along with a decline in GDP growth in january-march 2019

 3 percent, which will increase to 7 in 2020-21

 He further said, "apart from this, real estate should get the status of industry

 yahaan telephone par di gai jaankaree ke mutabik ek ladkaa or ladki railway trek ke najadik lahooluhaan haalat main pade hue mil jate hai, lekin buree tarah jakhmi hone ke baavjood donon jinda the
 The police immediately pick up both of them and take them to the hospital without losing any time, but at the Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, the girl dies while undergoing treatment at night, while the condition of the boy is still critical
 isi dauraan police ko ye pataa chalata he ki donon hi railway trek ke bagal main pade hone ke baavjood kisi train kii chapet main aane se jakhmi nahin hue, balki unhen kisi ne chaakuon se god kar lahooluhaan kar diya tha
 The attackers attacked the girl in the stomach with knives about five to six times and the boy was stabbed once
 haalanki is cese main police ko tab pehali baar thodi hairaani hui, jab usne is vaardaat ke bare main telephone par jaankaree denevaale shaks se dobaaraa baat karne kii koshish kii, kyonki tab kar kol karanevaale shaks kaa mobile phone rahasyamayi tareeke se band ho chukaa tha
 Now, to understand the whole incident, the police starts questioning the young man who was victim of the incident and with this he narrates a shocking story
 mul rup se maharashtra ke raigarh kaa rahanevaala 26 saal kaa noujvaan birbal prasad bataata he ki wo apni premika ke saath vaardaat ke vakt naranpura railway crossing ke nazadik ghoomane ke liye gaya tha, lekin achaanak jhaadiyon se sharaab ke nashe main dhutt chaar noujvaan unke saamne aa gaye or unhone uski premika ke saath badsuluki shuru kar di
 Tried to gang-rape her, on opposing them, the four attacked them with knives, but when this attack worsened their girlfriend's condition, all four left them on the spot and fled
 
 puri ghatana rongte khadey karanevaali thi
 a story that would have been on anyone's hearing would be reminiscent of the December 16 gang rape in Delhi, but here the police were constantly knocking many things
 unamem se ek to lakh koshish ke baavjood is ghatana kii khabar denevaale shaks se police kii baat nahin ho paane kii thi or doosraa ek ghaney rihaayshi ilaake ke bich se guzaranevaale is railway trek ke bich itani badi vaardaat kaa hone ke baavjood iske bare main kaanon-kaan kisi ko khabar tak nahin mili
 The police could not interrogate the boy who was injured due to the injury, but when the police examined his clothes and belongings, a paper part from his bag suddenly cleared the whole story
 Because this part was nothing but a suicide note
 lekin agar ye dabl suicide kii koshish thi, to wo ladke koun the, jinhone in donon ke saath zyaadati karne kii koshish kii? to kya gangrape kii koshish or chaakubazi kii wo kahani banaavati thi? aakhir kyon?ghayal ladke ke bag se mila suicide note puri kahani ko palat chukaa tha
 Meanwhile, the police came to know another shocking thing
 usne dekha ki ladke ke pet main chaaku kaa ek gaharaa waar to maujuud he, lekin naa to uske jacket par chaaku laga he, naa hi shart par or naa baniyaan par
 Now the question was, how can an attacker finally stab someone in his stomach without spoiling his clothes? When the police got a suicide note from one of these two boys, the whole story was almost cleared
 ladke ke bag se mili is suicide note main likhaa tha ki wo jo kaam karne ja rahaa he, wo sharmnaak or ghinauna he, lekin chunki use ladke ke gharavaalon ne bahut jaleel kiya he
 Therefore, he is compelled to do so
 is suicide note se ab ye baat takreeban saaf lag rahi thi ki shaayad ladke ne hi apni premika par chaakuon se hamalaa karne ke baad khud ko bhi chaaku maar kar jaan lene kii koshish kii or jab is koshish main wo naakaam ho gaya, to usne khud ko kaanoon kii nazaron se bachaane ke liye bilkul dilli ke 16 disambar ke jaisi ek kahani bana lee
 The police had already suspected the boy, but the getting of the suicide note, the stabbing of the knives, many of the bags in the story
 ye tamaam chizein police ke shaq ko yakeen main tabdeel kar rahi thi par tabhi saamne aae ek or subut ne police ko puri tarah santusht kar diya
 This was proof, the mobile phone which was switched off after calling the police
 police ne jab chaanbin kii, to ye mobile phone khudakushi kii koshish karanevaale birbal prasad kaa hi niklaa or uske paas se hi baraamad ho gaya
 That is, after hitting his girlfriend and himself with knives, Birbal himself called the police and told about himself and tried to confuse him
 takneekee jagat main har roj kuch nayaa ho rahaa he
 Our progress and your life are also being greatly affected by this progress

 'input: IANS After the inclusion of Sabir Ali in the BJP, a ruckus finally reached the end of his membership
 bijepi ne shanivaar dopaher kareeb sava 3 baje press conference karke bataaya ki bijepi ne sabir ali kii sadsyta khatm kar di he
 Sabir Ali, who was expelled from JDU, joined BJP on Friday
 bijepi pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki party ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh chaahate hai ki party netaa party forum main hi apni baat rakhen
 Whose choice was Sabir Ali? Did the Bihar BJP want to use Sabir Ali to show the mirror to Nitish Kumar or did Sabir really get the reward of Modi's praise
 vajah chaahe jo ho sabir kii sadsyta khatai main padane ke baad bijepi main ghamaasan much gaya
 If a camp is still advocating Sabir Ali, the Sushil Modi camp cannot think of any answer
 modi ab ye safai de rahe hai ki sabir ali par koi mukadmaa nahin he
 Delhi BJP leaders must have breathed a sigh of relief as soon as Sabir Ali issued a letter pending his membership
 lekil bihar bijepi ke chehre par havaaiyaan udne lagi hai
 Sushil Modi considered Sabir Ali to be a big catch against Nitish, but the leaders of Delhi dashed Sushil Modi's decision
 susheel modi ne kaha ki sabir ali ne khud hi apane faisle ko sthagit rakhane kaa aagrah kiya he, jaanch ke baad phir faisla hoga
 BJP National Vice President Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has withdrawn his tweet about Sabir Ali after the controversy escalated, but he still stands by his statement
 unhone kaha maine sabir ali ke bare main jo kuch kaha tha, ab bhi us par kaayam hum, main ab bhi kah rahaa hum ki unhen party ne nikaal dena chahie
 He said i deleted my tweet because Dawood Ibrahim's name was in it
 maine baad main vichaar kiya ki mujhe daaud ke naam kaa istemaal nahin karnaa chahie tha
 He said but my opposition to the inclusion of Sabir Ali in BJP is still going on
 mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne to sabir ali ke shaamil hone kaa kadaa virodh jataate hue kataaksh kiya tha ki ab daaud bhi jald hi bijepi jwine kar saktaa he
 BJP leader Balbir Punj is also unhappy with Sabir Ali joining the party, although former party president Nitin Gadkari says that it is necessary for everyone to come together to defeat the Congress
 unhone sabir ali kaa bijepi main swaagat kiya he
 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi's displeasure over the issue of Sabir can be gauged from the fact that he openly vented his anger on Twitter
 haalanki maamla garmaataa dekh shanivaar subah unhone apana twit hataa diya, lekin virodh par kaayam hai
 Even leaders like CP Thakur see no shortage of Sabir Ali, on the contrary, according to him, everyone should ride in the 'namo' wave
 seepi thakur ne kaha jab jediu main rahete hue hamen unase parhez nahin hua to hamen bijepi main aane par kyon parhez hoga
 However, it was decided that the BJP leaders of Bihar had a big role in taking Sabir Ali to the party, but the opposition of the leaders of Delhi overshadowed the decision
 aise main ab bijepi ko duusare netaaon ko party main shaamil karne ke pehle kai baar sochna padega

 PM Modi said that elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir again, here again mlas will be elected and there will be Chief Minister and Cabinet

 Some have also returned after being persuaded by their families: HM— HMO India (@hmoindia) March 19, 2015the failure of ISIS to attract Indian Muslims is due to their complete integration into the national mainstream: HM— HMO India (@hmoindia) March 19, 2015 Indian Muslims are patriots and are not swayed by fundamentalist ideologies

 @ bjprajnathsingh — HMO India (@hmoindia) March 19, 2015terrorism knows no boundaries and doesn't respect nations' sovereignties

 The Allahabad High Court's CBI inquiry order of the Allahabad High Court in the Noida Chief Engineer Yadav Singh Corruption Case was challenged by the UP government in the Supreme Court, which has been rejected by the Supreme Court in its hearing on Friday
 court ne upi sarkaar se kaha ki upi sarkaar ko is maamle main itani ruchi kyon he
 Let Yadav Singh come to court if he feels that the case should not be handed over to the CBI
 upi sarkaar ne vishesh anumati yachika daakhil kar kaha tha ki kendra sarkaar ke vittamantralay dwaara 24 farvari ko likhe gayi patr se saaf sabit hota he ki kendra is maamle main jabardastee sibiai jaanch karwaakar iskaa rajnatik phayda lenaa chaahati he
 The petition filed by the UP government said that petitioner Nutan Thakur had demanded a judicial inquiry before the High Court for which a High Level Judicial Commission headed by retired Judge AN Verma was constituted
 phir bhi hai court ne kendra sarkaar ke patr ke aadhaar par jaanch sibiai ko saunp di
 The UP government has requested a stay on the High Court order
 tippaniyan In the petition filed by the UP government, it was said that while the hearing was going on in the High Court, at the same time, the Director of the Finance Ministry of the Central Government had written a letter and recommended the investigation
 upi sarkaar ne aashcharya vyakt karte hue kaha he ki doirector dwaara likhaa gaya patr yachikakarta nutan thakur ke paas kaise pahunch gaya
 The UP government claimed that CBI investigation can be done only in those cases which need to be investigated outside the state or such facts come out which are of very technical aspects
 lekin, yadav singh ke khilaaf lage aaropon main is tarah kii baaten saamne nahin aa rahi
 In the petition, the intervention of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) created to investigate black money was also termed as wrong
 yachika main tark kiya gaya tha ki chunki bhrashtachar ke is maamle main yadav singh keval ek hi aaropee he isliye is maamle main esaiti kaa koi role nahin banataa
 The court asked the UP government why the UP government is so interested in this matter
 yadav singh ko court main aane den agar unhen yah lagata he ki is cese ko sibiai ko nahin saunpa janaa chahie
 The UP government had filed a special permission petition stating that the letter written by the Union Ministry of Finance on February 24 proves that the Center wants to take political advantage of it by forcibly conducting a CBI inquiry into the matter
 upi sarkaar kii taraf se daayar yachika main kaha gaya tha ki hai-court ke saamne yachikakarta nutan thakur ne nyaayik jaanch kii maang kii thi jiske liye avkashprapt jaj e en verma kii adhyakshata main hai level nyaayik ayog kaa gathan kar diya gaya tha
 Nevertheless, the High Court handed over the investigation to the CBI based on the Central Government letter
 upi sarkaar ne hai court ke aadesh par roak lagane kii guhaar kii he
 The comments upi sarkaar kii taraf se daakhil kii gayi yachika main kaha gaya tha ki jis vakt hai court main sunwaayee chal hi rahi thi usee vakt kendra sarkaar ke vitt mantralay ke doirector ne patr likhakar jaanch kii sanstuti kii thi
 The UP government has expressed surprise that the letter written by the director reached the petitioner Nutan Thakur
 upi sarkaar ne daawa karte hue kaha ki sibiai jaanch keval un maamalon main kii ja sakati he jis maamle main rajya ke baahar jaanch kii zarurat he yaa is tarah ke tathy saamne aaye jo bahut hi takneekee pahaluon ke hon
 However, such allegations are not forthcoming in the allegations against Yadav Singh
 yachika main kaledhan kii jaanch ke liye banaai gayi vishesh jaanch team (esaiti) ke hastkshep ko bhi galat qaraar diya gaya tha
 It was argued in the petition that since Yadav Singh is the only accused in this case of corruption, there is no role of SIT in this case
 upi sarkaar ne vishesh anumati yachika daakhil kar kaha tha ki kendra sarkaar ke vittamantralay dwaara 24 farvari ko likhe gayi patr se saaf sabit hota he ki kendra is maamle main jabardastee sibiai jaanch karwaakar iskaa rajnatik phayda lenaa chaahati he

 or kehete ye bhi hai ki jab daulat jaldi or beshumaar aati he to musiibat ke saath kai baar maut bhi le aati he
 By seeing what has happened in recent times with many newly created nobles in Delhi, these things have really started coming true
 sharaab kii dukaan ke baahar chakhnaa kaa khomacha lagane vaala ponti chaddha ho yaa electronics main dilli ke bade vyapaariyon main se ek arun gupta
 Or the latest billionaire builder Deepak Bhardwaj
 in saare raison kii ek hi kahani he
 Earned immense wealth, but could not manage home relationships
 balki usee daulat kii vajah se apane rishte hi apni jaan ke dushman ban gaye
 For the sake of wealth, Ponty Chadha and his brother Hardeep Chadha shot each other
 arun gupta kii supaari khud uske saale ne de daali
 And now the betel nut named Deepak Bhardwaj came out from inside his own house
 bete nitesh ne baap ko marava daalaa
 It is true that Deepak Bhardwaj's relationship with his wife and both sons was not good
 pichley 10 saal se ve apane gharavaalon se alag rah rahe the
 The wife and sons were not even paid
 dilli police ke sutron ke mutabik rishte kharaab hone ke baavjood salbhar pehle tak deepak apni bivi or beton se akasar mila karata tha
 They also used to come to the farm house
 magar pichley saal bharadwaj ko yah bhanak lag gai ki nitesh unki mahabuuba ke saath dosti kii pingen badha rahaa he
 And Bharadwaj got angry just from here
 unhone nitesh ke farm house main ghusane par hi roak laga di
 And this thing made the son the biggest enemy of his own father
 or phir ek bete ne vah faisla kiya, jiske bare main sochakar hi kisi kii ruh kaanp jaae
 This decision was the murder of Deepak Bhardwaj
 nitesh ne is bare main apane family friend or vakil balajit singh saharaavat se baat kii
 Sehrawat wanted to contest elections and needed money
 usee ne nitesh ke iraadon ko hawa di or chunaav spancer karne ko kaha
 But later she changed her mind and asked Nitesh to pay the full five crore for her father's murder
 kii maang kii
 Nitesh, badly bored with his father, agreed to it
 ab saharaavat ne apana dimag lagaana shuru kiya or haridwar ke ek aise mahant se baat kii, jiske armaan bade the
 This was Mahant Pratibhananda
 vah ek bade ashram kii shakl main aadhyatm kii badi dukaan kholana chahta tha or iske liye use rupye kamaane kaa har tarika gavaara tha
 Sehrawat offered him this 'big job' and he agreed
 ab tak saharaavat ko advance main 50 lakh ru
 had met
 isamen se usne takreeban saadhe teen lakh ru
 Hand over the Mahant
 usne apane driver or puraane chele purushottam urf monu ko uski takadir badal jane kaa sabjbag dikhaaya or vah do lakh ru
 Bhardwaj went out to hide
 dilli main bharadwaj ke farm house ke baahar usne do baar use nishaanaa banane kii koshish kii, lekin vah alag-alag vajahon se batch niklaa
 Purushottam persuaded one of his companions, Sunil alias Sonu and Amit, on the morning of March 26 for a few thousand rupees to do the job and both entered the farm house of Bhardwaj and finished it
 lekin sisitivi camaron ne unke raaj ko fash kar diya
 Now it was the turn of the plot to be exposed
 lekin chunki purushottam mahant se aage kisi ko jaanata hi nahin tha, so tafteesh aage nahin bad paa rahi thi
 Finally, when the police started questioning Bhardwaj's family members under suspicion, he started investigating his mobile phone and the younger son Nitesh said that his mobile phone was broken on the day of the incident
 tafteesh ke aage badaae par pataa chalaa ki nitesh ke paas ek aisa number tha, jiske bare main kisi ko pataa nahin tha
 When the police scanned the number, the long conversation between him and Sehrawat was revealed and then the cross interrogation of the two opened up the whole matter
 shaadi ke 25 saal baad tak deepak bharadwaj ke apni patni or donon beton se achche rishte the
 Even Deepak sent Nitesh to America to study b
tech
 chaar saal canada main rahane kaa uskaa sara kharch bhi deepak ne hi uthaaya tha
 Even the son of Shah Rukh Khan's wife Gauri Khan married his cousin with great pomp
 magar kareeb 10 saal pehle daulat aate hi bharadwaj kii soch badal gai
 Bhardwaj, a resident of a small village in Sonipat district of Haryana, adjacent to Delhi, was the first stenographer in the Sales Tax Department
 lekin uske armaan shuru se oonche the
 He quit his job in 1979 and started an automobile parts business in Delhi, and then after some time, he shut down the shop shutter and started doing property work
 bharadwaj ne dilli ke alaava noida, faridabad or gudgaanv jaisi jagahon par jameen kaa sauda shuru kar diya
 He then negotiated several disputed pieces of land
 ab bharadwaj kaa zyaadaatar vakt bade logon or netaaon ke saath uthne-baithne or ladakiyon ke saath mouj-masti karne main guzarane laga
 Getting up and sitting in high society, meeting new women became his pastime, and then on seeing the family left behind
 deepak ke is nae shagal ke bare main patni or bacchon ko pataa chalaa to ghar main jhagada shuru ho gaya
 Three years ago, Deepak met a girl from Kanpur who lived in Delhi
 deepak ne use apane farm house ke resort or marij haul main hone vaali partiyon or samarohon kaa incharge bana diya
 Bhardwaj and that girl became very close to each other
 haalanki vah umr main bharadwaj se kareeb 35 saal choti thi
 During that time Nitesh also used to visit his father's farm house constantly
 kuch mulakaaton ke baad nitesh kii bhi us ladki se dosti ho gai
 After this, the relationship grew so much that Deepak's lover started reporting to Nitesh about his business
 vah uske jariye apane baap ke saare kaarobaar or daulat ke bare main jaankaree ikattha karata tha
 But the friendship of the two could not remain hidden for long
 deepak apane bete nitesh or us ladki ke bich ke rishton kii khabar lag gai
 He jailed Nitesh one day and fired him from the farm house and also threatened that he would divorce her mother and marry the girl and not give one of her property to the parents
 police sutron ke mutabik bas isi ke baad nitesh ne apane baap ko raste se hataane kaa faisla kar liya taaki use duusari shaadi karne kaa mauka hi na mili
 He feared that he would not really get any share in the property
 giraftaar ke baad nitesh ne police ke saamne jo bayaan diya, usamen usne kaha, “meraa baap isi maut ke kaabil tha
 He never considered us his son
 koi dushman bhi aisa nahin karata, jo mere baap ne ham logon ke saath kiya
 He would have blown millions of rupees on horses, but we used to yearn for every penny
 yahaan tak ki hamen uske farm house main bhi jane kii ijaajat nahin thi
 He always treated me badly, my mother, my elder brother and me
 vah paraai auraton or ladki ke liye unheen ke saamne hamaari beijjati karata tha
 Friends, neighbors, relatives, we used to make fun of people, see, how are the billionaire's sons living? Such a death was right for him
 mujhe apane kiye par koi afsos nahin he
 "the issue is not only of hatred, but of the wealth to which the son tried to hide his greedy face by wearing a mask of hate
 daulat kisi ko andhaa bana saktaa he
 So blind that then he does not see any relation
 mahanagaron main badi kothiyon ke oonche daravaajon ke peeche kaa ek sach yah bhi he
 It is more difficult to laugh than say
 lekin bollywood ke masakhre (hasya abhinayta) johny walker ne apni mazaakia bhav-bhangimaaon se karodon senepremiyon ko na keval gudgudaya, balki apni 'champi' (geet) se unki sari thakaan bhi utaarte rahe
 Johnny Walker used his facial expressions like 'jaane kahan mera jigar gaya ji' (mr
 and Mrs
 55), 'sir jo tera chakraye or dil doo jaye' (pyaasa) and 'ae dil hai difficult jeein aaye' Make the songs immortal forever
 vah apane maasoom, lekin shararti chehre se sabko apni ore khinchne kaa madda rakhte the
 Let's know something special related to the life of this great artist: 1
 1925 ko indore main janme walker kaa asli naam badaruddin jamaluddin kaaji tha
 He was a bus conductor before joining the film industry
 2unke pita srinagar main ek kapadaa mil main majdoor the
 When the textile mill closed, the whole family moved to Mumbai
 pita ke liye apane 15 sadasyeey parivaar kaa bharan-poshan karnaa mushkil ho rahaa tha
 To reduce the burden on his father's shoulders, Badruddin continued to try his hand in various occupations, including working as a conductor in the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses
 3
 At the age of 27, he was primarily posted at Dadar Bus Depot
 badaruddin bas main yatriyon kaa tikat kaatane ke alaava ajeebogareeb kisse-kahaniyaan sunaakar yatriyon kaa man bahalaate rahete
 His motive behind this was that someone would recognize his secret act
 unki yah ichha puri bhi hui
 Actor Balraj Sahni, who wrote the screenplay for Gurudutt's film 'baaji', caught sight of Badruddin during a bus journey
 4
 Sahni suggested Badruddin to try his luck with Guru Dutt
 bataaya jaataa he ki set par dutt se milane pahunche badaruddin se ek sharaabi kii acting karne ke liye kaha gaya, jise dekh gurudutt itane prabhavit hue ki unhone badaruddin ko turant 'baaji' (1951) main sin kar liya
