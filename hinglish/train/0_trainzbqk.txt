 saath hi vah ab chuttee par jane se jude vivaad ko bhi band karnaa chaahate hai, unhone ichha jataai he ki ab in sabhi baton par pardaa dalanaa chahie
 However, some senior lawyers believe that the controversy is being lit up for the purpose of targeting Justice Sikri
 justise sikri ne purv chif justise vaai ke sabharwal ke jivan par aadhaarit kitaab launch ke maukey par agency pitiai se kaha, ‚Äòmain nahin chahta ki yah vivaad or khinche, main chahta hum ki yah khatm ho

 Rohatgi said that such people only want publicity without knowing the facts

 Senior advocate Indira Jaising has already said that if Justice Sikri had expected to dispute the selection committee's decision on the CBI case, he should not have joined this committee
 saath hi unhone kaha tha ki justise ko landan court main niyukt ko lekar apana paksh chayan samiti main shaamil hone se pehle hi rakh dena chahie tha

 nyaayamurti eke patnayak or nyaayamurti jees khehar kii peeth ne unki jamaanat yachika ko bhi khaarij kar diya or kaha ki isamen koi thos aadhaar nahin he
 The bench rejected his review petition, saying, "we do not see any merit in the review petition and are not ready to interfere with the decision of the lower court

 The CBI strongly opposed Nupur's petitions

 uttarakhand main vaise to congress se bijepi main gaye sabhi 11 baagiyon kii seat par chunaav is vakt sabase kadaa or bada mana ja rahaa he
 From Harish Rawat, the people of the state are wondering whether these 11 mlas will be able to do well for the BJP
 in sabake bich agar koi seat sabase zyada charchaa main he to wo he uttarakhand kii kotdwar seat
 Negi defeated Khanduri Koyhi is the seat on which rebel Congress leader Harak Singh Rawat is contesting on the lotus trail, while on the other hand, the state Health Minister Surendra Singh Negi is leading the Congress
 aapako yaad dilaa den ki ye vahi negi hai jinhone 2012 ke chunaav main kotdwar seat se bhaajapa ke mukhyamantri rahe general bhuwan chandra khanduri ko haraa kar ek nayaa itihaas uttarakhand main rachaa tha
 Negi's move came because the political hunger seat is special for the Congress and BJP in many respects because this time Harak Singh Rawat, who is the most talked about rebel here, is contesting from the BJP ticket
 vahi harak singh ravat jinhone 2016 main march maheene main uttarakhand kii raajnneeti main bhuuchaal machaane main sabase badi bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The Kotdwar seat is completely new this time for Harak, who won from seats like Pauri Rudraprayag and Lansdowne in Uttarakhand
 negi ko janata se he ummidabaagi hone kaa dank kahin naa kahin ravat ke saath chal rahaa he iske saath hi unke saamne khadey congress sarkaar main maujuuda swasthya mantri surendra singh negi ne bhi puri takat ravat ko chaaron khaane chit karne main laga di he
 People are also in tension this time as to whom they should choose as both the leaders are from their own
 surendra singh negi janata ke bich apane kaarykaal kii duhai lekar ja rahe hai
 They feel that the public will give them a chance to serve by taking them to the stage of victory
 iske alaava ve harak par kataaksh karke bhi janata ke dilon main jagah bana rahe hai
 On the other hand, even Harak Singh is not backing down
 negi ko bijepi kii lahar se ummidadabang chhavi or robdar andaaj se bhale hi harak hameshaa se charchaa main rahe hon lekin is baar unki ek or chhavi janata ke saamne he wo he baagi kii chhavi
 Harak, who is contesting on a BJP ticket after breaking away from the government, is engaged in campaigning here day and night
 pahari or plane votaron ke bich talmail kaise bithaana he iske liye harak badi baariki se kotdwar main prachaar-prasar kar rahe hai
 Harak Singh Rawat believes that this time there is a wave of BJP not only in Kotdwar but also in Uttarakhand and they are winning from Kotdwar by huge votes
 imotional card khel rahe netakotdwar ne swasthya mantri to diya lekin kaha ye bhi ja rahaa he ki mantri ji kotdwar kii tabiyat ko thik nahin kar paae
 For the victory, Harak and Negi are also not averse to playing emotional cards among the public
 harak jahaan aae din aansu baha kar janata ko apni taraf aakarshith karnaa chaahate hai vahiin negi bhi unase peeche nahin hai
 They too are not leaving a single chance to woo the public from house to house
 lekin, janata kii maane to wo sabhi se naakhush he, jahaan swasthya mantri unka ilaaj karwaane main bhi sakasham najar nahin aae
 The most important thing on the seat of 'thakur' which has been held since independence, is that if anyone has won this seat since independence, then only Thakur has won
 kai logon ne kismat aajamaai lekin janata ne sirf thakur ko hi vidhayak banaaya he
 From MLA Surendra Singh Negi to Shailendra Rawat, whoever became the MLA here became Thakur
 is baar donon thakur maidan main he or janata kisko taj se navajti he ye aane vaali taarikh 11 march hi bataaegi

 bhartiya janata party ne 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi ke netritv main ladaa or prachand bahumat ke saath jeet darj kii
 Narendra Modi assumed the responsibility of the post of Prime Minister and soon the bjp's national president post Amit Shah, his closest to Gujarat
 modi ke naam par bijepi kii jeet kaa jo kaaravaan aam chunaav main chalaa, wo maharashtra, haryana hote hue upi, uttarakhand, himachal or goa se hote hue ab uttar-purv ke tripura tak pahunch gaya he
 In the states where BJP got a majority, it formed a government at the same time, during this period, in some states, the BJP formed a government despite not being the largest party
 kisi rajya main kshetreey dalon ko samarthan diya to kahin unke samarthan secongress mukt bharatke aahvaan ko puraa karte hue aage bade
 Now Karnataka's turn in this episode
 jahaan aagaamee 12 may ko vidhansabha chunaav ke liye voting honi he
 It is the only state in South India, where the BJP has been in a strong position
 ek baar yahaan aisa mauka bhi aayaa, jab bhartiya janata party ko sabase zyada siton par jeet mili, phir bhi wo sarkaar banane main kaamyaab nahin ho saki
 BJP won the most seats in 2004 In the 2004 Karnataka assembly elections, BJP first realized its strength in the state
 kul 224 vidhansabha siton par hue chunaav main bijepi ne 79 siton par jeet darj kii
 While Congress had to satisfy 65 and Janata Dal Secular 58 seats
 sarkaar nahin bana saki bijepiis chunaav main bijepi sabase badi party banakar to ubhari lekin sarkaar banane ke liye jaruri jaadui aankade se kaaphi peeche rah gai
 As a result, the Congress and the Janata Dal Secular formed a government in alliance
 haalanki, maujuuda raajnneeti main is baat ko lekar charchaa kii jaati he ki bijepi tod-jod kii ranneeti se un rajyon main bhi sarkaar bana leti he, jahaan congress ko sabase zyada siten milti hai
 The same happened in Goa in the 2017 assembly elections
 jahaan congress ne sabase zyada siten jeetin, lekin kshetreey dalon or nirdaleeyon ke samarthan se sarkaar banaai
 In addition, in Nagaland, BJP supported the NDPP and eliminated the NPF winning the most seats
 ye bhi padhein: jab karnataka main pehali baar khilaa tha camel, 5 saal main BJP ko badalane pade 3 cmaba karnataka main amit shah jeet ke daawey kar rahe hai
 Congress and Janata Dal Secular are also contesting strongly
 aise main is baat kii ashanka bhi jataai ja rahi he ki chunavi nattejey trishanku vidhansabha kii taraf na chale jaaen
 If such a situation arises, then once again, equations like 2004 can be seen in Karnataka and interesting manipulation strategies can also be revealed
 pareshaaniyon main fanse pakistani raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ne mangalvaar ko apni chuppi todate hue nyaaypalika or apane virodhiyon par unheen maamalon ko teji se aage badhaane kaa aarope lagaaya jo sarkaar ke khilaaf he
 Addressing a public meeting of more than 50,000 people on the fourth anniversary of his wife and late Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Zardari said, "we do not want to make history, not Sukhiryan
" pradhanmantri or unke cabinet main nihit raajnneeti asambhav ko sambhav banane kaa naam he
 He said, "nation building is the art of making the impossible possible and i believe that i am doing it
" ilaaj ke liye 6 disambar ko ekaek dubai jaakar sarkaar ke bhavishya ko lekar atakalein paidaa karne vaale jaradaari kii yah pehali tippanee he
 Referring to the slow prosecution of Benazir Bhutto's murder case, he said, "I would like to ask Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary what happened to the Bhutto case?" These courts do not work under me
 irfan se baatcheet main yah khatra hameshaa bana rahata he ki unke sachche-sidhe bhav bhare jawaab sunne ke anand main kahin aap apane sawaal hi na bhul jaaen
 As such, it is not in his system to start acting on a request anywhere
 lekin unase batiyana hi unke saath ek apratyaashit-se, naatakeey safar par chalane jaisaa sukh detaa he
 Recently he came to Delhi to attend the 12th Osian Cinefan Film Festival, with Hamarah and screenwriter Sutapa Sikdar
 usee dauraan imperial hotel ke apane kamare main unhone assistant editor shivakesh ke saath cinema ke apane kuch taaja anubhav saajha kiye
 What is something new in your life in recent times? Pansingh (tomar) success
 sirf isliye nahin ki yah ek acchhee film he balki isliye ki bahut aayam hai usamen
 That kind of a man
 jindagi jeena or hamaare liye kahani chhod janaa
 The hand of a divine (spiritual force) seemed like she wanted that story to be shared, and how the story of that time becomes relivent today
 ek or cheez
 
 
 There are some challenging roles, which i would like to do more often if i get the chance
 mujhe lagata he, main shaayad puri tarah se (parformens) de nahin paaya
 Don't know what the reasons were behind that
 
 
 kuch demand kiya gaya mujhase jo main
 
 
 You Know
 
 
 kasar rah gai
 
 
 Which roles have you done? Like Life of Pi (director: Ang Lee)
 bahut zyada chalanging thi
 My system of working was not coming anywhere
 diarector mujhse demand kar rahaa tha, mujhe complitli ek fahrren territary main le jake, mujhse kuch parformens chaah rahaa tha jo mere liye bahut hi nai thi
 i want to know about what will (happened) to him lastly
 da ameging spiderman (nirdeshkah mark web) main aapako liye jane par badi charchaa hui thi lekin film main aapkaa nammaatr kaa role dekhakar hairat hui
 Your opinion? i knew from the beginning that this is my important role but the story is not its
 haa, jitne seen the, usamen se kuch cat gaye
 That 500 crores
 se zyada kii film he
 His interest in him is to make the story strong
 usamen kaat-chhaant hogi hi, usamen kai baar aap bhi chapete main aa jate hai
 For me it was an experience working with a good director
 vah mere kaam kii izzat karata he
 Will see what happens next
 lekin kuch actors kehete hai ki hamen west ke trep main nahin funsana chahie
 Where is the trap? He is not coming to you
 vahaan janaa apane aap main bahut badi jaddojahad he
 The actor here is not ready for there
 hollywood yahaan ke market ko inkesh karnaa chahta he
 They will pickup the talent that will fit in their system
 (e
 R
 ) rahamaan ko unhone picap kiya
 Take me to the village
 aane vaali jenereshan main bahut saare log honge, jinako ve lenge
 (hollywood movies) France, UK market is over
 ab india kii baari he
 You are the most present Indian actor in Hollywood
 ve kya chijen he jo aapako vahaan kaam karne ke liye inspire karti hai?vahaan kii filmein mujhe jis tarah kaa chalange detii hai, jaisaa raag, jaisaa sur chhedane ko bolti hai, vah mauka mujhe or kahin nahin miltaa
 That is my interest
 mere liye vah sarvival kii jang nahin, (balki) ek lagjri he
 i would not get even a tenth of the money from there, in many films
 lee ne mujhase jo demand kiya, mujhe nahin lagata, duniya main or koi diarector mujhase wo demand karegaa
 So this challenges my faculty
 march main jab paansingh tomars hit hui or team ke log mumbai main uskaa majaa le rahe the tab aap dedh maheene tak haryana, punjab, himachal ke doordaraj ke gaanvon main anup singh kii film (kissa) kii shooting karte rahe
 How was that experience? Missed that success
 ja ko
 Panasah (success) pulled me out of the story a bit
 mere do part ho gaye
 Interestingly, that story was also partnered
 or main us partishan ko litreli ji rahaa tha
 You have been a decade and a half in Hindi cinema
 abhinay main aapane ek mukaam banaaya lekin abhi bhi aap un actors main shaamil nahin ho paae hai, jo apane dam par 100-100 karod ru
 To get the business done
 meri daud vah he hi nahin
 i 500 crores
 kii film kar rahaa hum (life ov paai)
 Would be great when my film was Rs 100 crore
 kaa bijness karegi, lekin vah meri kism kii film honi chahie
 If i go out of my land and dance on the other's ground and beat the drum and if that ground does not support my feet, then i will not be able to enjoy that dance
 lekin jab aap shahrukh, salmaan or akshay kumaar kii filmon ko 100 karod ru
 If you see more than you earn, what do you think comes to mind? Ever think that the audience wants this and these people are successful in entertaining the audience
 phir aap us tarah kii film karte bhi hai to lagata he ki aap kitna anterten ho rahe hai usase? or kya aap aisa karte rahanaa chahenge? itane saalon se aap us game ko dekh rahe hai
 There is no new revelation for you
 har aadmi kaa apana-apana game he
 You need your land ja banani he, bajaae iske ki aap compari
 Keep on doing
 diarectors ke ek tabake main abhi tak bhi andeshaa tha ki koi commercial film puri tarah se aapke kandhe par rakhkar nahin banaai ja sakati
 Pansingh has broken this myth? film industry ke liye todaa he
 But does this industry have such people who can make other Pan Singh or films like that? That kind of generation is coming
 vah aegi, daur badalegaa to vaise producers bhi aaenge
 But i have been doing my own kind of films on my own terms, whether in the field
 kabool ho, nemsek ho, hasil ho, rog ho
 Yes, the day my film earns more money, then i will have more choice to do that kind of story
 wo main chahta hum
 What's new in your new movies? filmon kaa hissaa ban rahaa hum, un 
 There is a kind of rise of films here
 ve colaboraton vaali filmein hai
 
 kissa ke chaar mulkon ke produsar hai or lunch box (nirdeshkah ritesh batra; is film kii shooting 4 agast ko mumbai main shuru hui) ke bhi 3-4 countries ke produsar hai
 This is not just for the Hollywood market, but also the European market, which i was not a part of before
 aai think, ye filmein mere liye doosraa ek rasta kholengi
 You live in Mumbai

 Sujata Singh was removed from the post of Foreign Secretary and s Jaishankar was made the new Foreign Secretary
 sujatha singh se pehle api venkateshwaran ko 28 saal pehle 1987 main rajeev gandhi ne hataaya tha
 Sujatha Singh's tenure was still 8 months left
 pradhanmantri karyaalay sujatha singh ko disambar main hi hataanaa chahta tha, magar videshmantri ke dakhal par maamla tal gaya
 In the last six months, the Prime Minister's Office has not given the green signal to the appointment of ambassadors by the Foreign Ministry, which means that the Prime Minister had made up his mind to remove the Foreign Secretary
 sujatha singh kii niyukti manmohan singh sarkaar ke samay hui thi
 Even at that time Manmohan Singh wanted to make Jaishankar the foreign secretary, but Sujatha Singh's father PV Rajeshwar Gandhi has been very close to the family
 vah intelligence beuro ke pramukh bhi rahe or baad main unhen upie sarkaar ne uttar pradesh kaa rajyapal bhi banaaya tha
 On the other hand, Subharanyam, the father of S
 Jaishankar, was very close to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, also a great knowledgeable in defense matters and a mediator of the beginning of the nuclear deal
 america raashtrapati or bhartiya pradhanmantri kii hyderabad house main hui saajha press conference ke dauraan pehla sawaal donon netaaon se poocha gaya tha
 The first answer was for Obama, and while he was replying, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gestured and invited Jaishankar to him, asking something while Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh was sitting in front
 yah sab tivi par nazar nahin aayaa, lekin vahaan maujuud sabhi patrakaron ko iskaa abhas ho gaya ki videsh mantralay main sab kuch thik-thaak nahin chal rahaa he
 The biggest thing is that s Jaishankar was retiring on January 31, so this decision was also taken
 jaishankar farrate se roosi bhashaa bolte hai or china ke maamalon ke bhi jaankaar hai
 The Prime Minister's Office feels that s Jaishankar is also an important role in persuading the Obama administration for the 26 January visit
 sabase bada sawaal he ki ab sujatha singh kaa kya hoga? unke paas ek hi vikalp he ki vah tyaagptr de den yaa phir jaisaa kii charchaa he rajdoot ban kar paris chali jaaen
 
 
 Eventually, the UPA government's stamp on Sujatha Singh went heavy

 He got a chance to make political khichdi for the first time
 bhaajapa kaa makasad dilli ke teen lakh daliton ke ghar se mutthi bhar chaaval or daal mangakar unhen party se jodpha tha
 But don't you find it strange that in the chefs' tasty world, there is no way of finding a Dalit name among the well-known people? Manohar replies, "the Dalit and Scheduled Tribe dishes are very tasty
" ve khaanaa pakaane kii kala main bhi maahir hote hai
 But like other professions, here too they do not appear on the front
 haalanki, mere puure bijness main khaanaa pakaane vaale kareeb saath fisadi log inhen samudaayon ke hai

 Then the bread is rolled and cooked on the reverse pot
 aise or bhi kai vyanjan hai
 But perhaps the hesitation between them wrote less studies, financial constraints do not let these people come forward
 manohar sankoch ke saath yah kehete bhi hai ki sone par suhaaga hota agar yah khichdi koi dalit shef hi pakaata
 Khichdi in Maharashtra is also called Poornan
 iskaa matlab he aisa bhojan jisamen saare poshak tatv maujuud hon
 Now only the election results will show how nutritious it will prove to be for the BJP
 dalit shef ke sawaal par is aayojan ke sutaradhar mohan laal gihaara kehete hai, ''suzav uttam he
 If permission is given from the top leadership, we will cook khichdi at the mandal level before 2019 and assembly elections and then Dalits can be considered to cook khichdi from their own hands

 Rest in peace Om Puri
 a true giant of cinema, a hero of mine, and one of the most masterfully talented, humble, and warm souls i ever met
 Working with him was an honor
 i remember seeing him in classic Bollywood films as well as groundbreaking British cinema like 'my Son the Fanatic' and 'east is East'
 He transcended cultural boundaries in a way no one else had at that point, bridging the gap i felt in myself, a consistent presence in both Hindi and English films
 i once asked him what film he was proudest of, he told me 'ardh Satya', where he played an idealistic young cop in a corrupt police force, was one of his first big lead roles and he had a soft spot for it
 His charisma shines through from the first frame
 In a way Om was like this character, a beacon of warmth in an industry often awash with ego
 He was someone who seemed to be doing it for the right reasons, still so humble and cool despite being an icon
 He remains an inspiration to so many
 Thank you Om-ji, for your incredible gift to us all

 com / ifutip2ei0rest in peace Om Puri
 a true giant of cinema, a hero of mine, and one of the most masterfully talented, humble, and warm souls i ever met
 Working with him was an honour
 i remember seeing him in classic Bollywood films as well as groundbreaking British cinema like 'my Son the Fanatic' and 'east is East'
 He transcended cultural boundaries in a way no one else had at that point, bridging the gap i felt in myself, a consistent presence in both Hindi and English films
 i once asked him what film he was proudest of, he told me 'ardh Satya', where he played an idealistic young cop in a corrupt police force, was one of his first big lead roles and he had a soft spot for it
 His charisma shines through from the first frame
 In a way Om was like this character, a beacon of warmth in an industry often awash with ego
 He was someone who seemed to be doing it for the right reasons, still so humble and cool despite being an icon
 He remains an inspiration to so many
 Thank you Om-ji, for your incredible gift to us all

 The central government has told the Supreme Court that it has decided to change the current 'once in five years' policy in relation to government subsidy to Muslims going on Haj pilgrimage, to adopt a 'once in life' policy

 The government said that the correct data regarding the travel subsidy given to pilgrims going through the Haj Committee of India in 2012 will be known only after completion of Haj pilgrimage and their return to India
 sarkaar ke anusaar, 70 se adhik umr ke sadasyon or sabsidi ke liye pehle teen baar asafal aavedan karne waalon ko praathamikta di jaaegi

 1
 privet college ke daakhile main kitni dhaandhlee hoti he, paise kaa khel chalata he
 2
 pratibhashali chaatro ko chhodkar paise vaale bacchon kaa daakhila 2 number se paise lekar hota he
 3
 supreme court ne NEET lagu karne kaa aadesh diya he
 But it is heard that the government will overturn the order of the Supreme Court by bringing an ordinance
 4
 Many leaders, private colleges of mps are running
 5
 Gorakhandha is going on in many colleges, so these leaders do not want NEET exam
 6
 You are requested not to bring an ordinance to stop NEET, otherwise the message will go that the central government is supporting those who have black money
 ek fasebuk post main antar dharmik shaadi karne yani kathith lav jehad vaale 100 jodon kii suchi jari kar khuleam in par hamale kaa aahvaan karne se sansani fail gai he
 This post on social media is being fiercely ridiculed
 haalanki raahat kii baat yah rahi ki fasebuk ne 'hindutv vaarta' naam ke is jehar failaane vaale pej ko suspend kar diya he, isliye ab ye post nahin dikh rahaa
 The Times of India reported that this page was openly called upon by 'hindu lions' to hunt down those included in the list
 isamen 102 aise mardon-auraton kii suchi jari kii gai he, jinhone duusare dharm main shaadi kii he
 Not only this, a link to their Facebook profile has also been shared
 yah jaharila post hindutv vaarta fasebuk pej par 28 janvari ko post kiya gaya tha
 According to Alt News, a website disclosing fake news, this list was first released on the 'justice for Hindus' Facebook page in November last year
 haalanki, tab isamen kisi tarah kii hinsa kaa aahvaan nahin kiya gaya tha
 The most surprising thing is that on Monday, a Twitter user named Satish Milavarpu openly stated that he operates this page and he said that 'those who inter-religious marry on Facebook will then create a page
 ' usne likhaa he, 'mujhe hindutv vaarta pej kaedmin honeka garv he
 i will make a page on it again
 'fasebuk ke pravaktaa ne kaha he ki unki niti samaaj ko surakshit rakhane or aise jahrile vichaaron ko rokane kii he
 Such material is immediately removed whenever it is detected
 ek twitor yujar dwaara fasebuk par is maamle main aawaaj buland kii gai thi
 a Twitter handle named @brumbyoz was posted on 4 February in protest against the Hindutva talk page, which also hoped to arrest those who handle the page
 twitor par logon se yah bhi apil kii gai ki vah apni fasebuk profile or anya soshal media plateform par maujuud profile ko privesi setting ke dwaara surakshit rakhen
 If you or someone you know is in an inter-community marriage plz make sure that the privacy settings on your facebook profiles are such that only trusted friends are able to access your profile
 We are living in dangerous times and we have to tread cautiously
 - Brumby (@brumbyoz) February 4, 2018 ham pitru maanate hai
 Until a person is born after his death, he stays in the subtle world
 aisa maanate hai ki in pitaron kaa aashirwad sookshmlok se parivaar janon ko miltaa rahata he
 In Pitrupaksha, fathers come to the earth to pay attention to their people and remove their problems by blessing them
 pitrupaksh main ham log apane pitaron ko yaad karte hai or unki yaad main daan dharm kaa paalan karte hai
 This time Pitrupaksha will be from 13 September to 28 September
 pitrupaksh main kis tarah kaaryon kaa paalan karen?- pitrupaksh main ham apane pitaron ko niyamit rup se jal arpit karte hai- yah jal dakshin disha kii ore munh karke dopaher ke samay diya jaataa he- jal main kaala til milaayaa jaataa he or haath main kush rakkha jaataa he- jis din purvaj kii dehanth kii tithi hoti he, us din ann or vastra kaa daan kiya jaataa he- usee din kisi nirdhan ko bhojan bhi karaayaa jaataa he- iske baad pitrupaksh ke kaary samaapt ho jate hankun pitaron kaa shraadh kar saktaa he?- ghar kaa varisht purush sadsy nity tarpan kar saktaa he- uske abhaav main ghar ko koi bhi purush sadsy kar saktaa he- pautra or naati ko bhi tarpan or shraadh kaa adhikaar hota he- vartmaan main striyaan bhi tarpan or shraadh kar sakati hai- sirf itnaa dhyaan rakkhen ki pitrupaksh kii saavdhaaniyon kaa paalan karankin chizon kaa karen parhez?- is avadhi main donon vela snaan karke pitaron ko yaad karnaa chahie- kutap vela main pitaron ko tarpan den
 In this veela, tarpan has special significance - Kush and black sesame have special importance in tarpan
 inke saath tarpan karnaa adbhut parinaam detaa he- jo koi bhi pitrupaksh kaa paalan karata he use is avadhi main keval ek vela satvik bhojan grahan karnaa chahie- pitrupaksh main satvik aahaar khaaen
 Avoid onion garlic, meat liqueur - Avoid using milk as much as possible - Fathers should offer white flowers with light fragrance, pungent flowers are forbidden - Tartan and nodules to fathers facing south Donation should be done - recite daily Bhagavad Gita in Pitripaksh - Never perform Shraddha Karma by taking loans or under pressure

 shanivaar ko bhartiya cricket team ke captain viraat kohli ne ek video twit kiya tha, jisamen sadak par plastic phenkane vaale ek shaks ko anoushka sharma daantate hue najar aa rahi thim
 Now that person has reprimanded Anushka and Virat by sharing a post on their Instagram account
 us shaks kaa naam arhan singh he or unhone likhaa he- disclemur: apane is post se mujhe shoharat paane kii koi ichha nahin he
 Anushka was angry at the garbage dumper on the road, see VIDEO she wrote further - Horrible! i casually threw a small piece of plastic while driving
 paas se guzar rahi ek car kii khidki neeche hoti he
 Out of that, Anushka Sharma shouted like a roadside man
 main apni laaparvaahee ke liye maafee maangata hum, lekin anoushka sharma kii shabdon main agar thodaa tahjeeb hoti to usase wo choti star nahin ho jaatin
 There are many types of manners and cleanliness - one of them is the tone of conversation
 Disclaimer: i have no desire to gain any mileage from this post of mine
 
 
 Horrible! So i happened to carelessly Litter a sq mm of plastic while driving! a car passing by rolls their window down and there we have our wonderful @anushkasharma ranting and yelling like a crazy roadside person! While I'm apologetic for my carelessness, Mrs Anushka Sharma Kohli a little etiquette and politeness in ur dialogue wouldn't have made ua lesser star !! There are all kinds of manners and hygiene
 
 verbal etiquette is one of them! The garbage that mistakenly went out of the window of my "luxury car"
 
 
 Was way less then the garbage that came out from your mouth
 
 
 From ur "luxury car's" window
 
 
 Or the trashy mind @virat
 kohli to shoot and post this online
 
 
 For whatever gains
 
 
 Now thats some serious trash !!! a post shared byarhhan Singh (@arhhansingh) onjun 16, 2018 at 7:05 am PDT The trash that accidentally fell out of my luxury car was much less than the garbage that came out of your mouth
 
 
 aapke lagjri car kii khidki se
 
 
 Or the small mind of Virat Kohli, who shot it and posted it online
 ye sabase bada kachra he
 Watch the video posted by Virat
 Saw these people throwing garbage on the road & pulled them up rightfully
 Traveling in a luxury car and brains gone for a toss

 Along with Sana, her boyfriend Ismail Khan has also been arrested
 donon par ek mahila ko dhamkaane or uske yon shoshan kaa aarope he
 Senior Inspector of Amboli police station Ramesh Khadtre said, "following the complaint of media consultant Poonam Khanna, Sana Khan, Ismail Khan and their servant Ramu Kanaujia were charged under Section 354 (assault for defamation) of IPC, 506 (threatening) and Arrested under 34 (same intention)
 ‚Äôadhikari ne kaha ki teenon aropiyon ko baad main ek adaalat main pesh kiya gaya

 police ke mutabik, salmaan khan abhinit film ‚Äòjai ho‚Äô main adaakaari kar chuki sanaa khan 2012 main rielity tivi sho ‚Äòbig bos‚Äô main bhi hissaa le chuki hai
 Police say Sana Khan and her boyfriend Ismail threatened Poonam on October 21 over the issue of a newspaper article
 punam kaa aarope he ki sanaa or ismail ne unki baanhen marod di or unhen galat tareeke se chuaa
 Both suspected that Poonam had leaked some information to the media, due to which the article was published in the newspaper
 khadtare ne kaha, ‚Äòyah ghatana andheri main ek aspataal ke baahar hui
 The victim went to the hospital to get her health checked
 raamu unke paas aayaa or unhen aspataal se baahar khinch le gaya jahaan sanaa or ismail ne unase badasluki kii or unhen dhamkee di
 In the article on which the controversy arose, questions were raised on the anticipatory bail granted to Sana in 2013 in a kidnapping case
 bharat ke chunaav itihasamein dharm or jati kaa ek bada mahatv he
 And this importance is further increased in UP
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Election 2019) main vipaksh ke bante hone kii vajah se bijepi kaa ek bada phayda hua tha
 In such a situation, BJP can be directly benefited by the distribution of votes on this basis
 haalanki, pichley chunaav (lok Sabha Election 2019) se alag is baar mayawati kii basapa, akhilesh yadav kii sapa or congress ne voton ke bantane kii kisi bhi tarah kii sambhaavna ko khatm karne kii koshish kii he
 According to the 2011 census, Uttar Pradesh has 19 percent of the total Muslim population
 jo desh main rahane vaale ausat 14 fisadi muslimon se bhi zyada he
 Whereas in UP, SC people constitute 21% of the total population
 jabaki desh main kul essi kii aabaadi 17 fisadi he
 But in a state where Uttar Pradesh has more population than other states, these figures are converted into large figures of voters
 2014 main hue chunaav ke aankadon or eczit pole ke anusaar congress akele yadav vot ko prabhavit nahin kar sakati he, yah vajah he ki aise 80 fisadi vot mayawati kii basapa or akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party ke khate main gaye the
 And the Congress was successful in getting only four per cent votes of the Yadavs
 vahiin agar essi jati ke vot kii baat karen to jati ke kul vot pratishat kaa 79 fisadi hissaa samaajawaadee party or bispi ke hisse main gaya tha
 While the Congress was able to get only three per cent of the vote of SC caste in its account
 vahiin bijepi ke khate main 17 fisadi vot gaye the
 Leaders associated with Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati's party believe that this time also due to Congress there will be no change in the vote percentage of their party
 haalanki unka kahana he ki congress is baar bijepi ko milane vaale ucch jati ke vot ko kaat sakati he
 If we look at the figures, the total 67 percent votes of the upper caste caste go to the BJP account
 jabaki congress is jati ke 12 fisadi vot par kabje kii baat karti he jo sapa-basapa ko milane vaale 21 fisadi vot pratishat se kaaphi kam he
 However, when it comes to the vote of Muslims, they divide it between the SP-BSP and the Congress by 80-20 per cent
 haalanki is baar gramin ilaakon main rahane vaale logon kaa maananaa he ki congress ke paksh main bhi is baar muslim pehle kii tulana main zyada matdaan kar sakate hai
 The convictions of criminals in Delhi are so high that even the police seems helpless in many cases
 isaki taaja misaal us vakt dekhne ko mili, jab hatya ke ek maamle main gavaah bane shaks ko goli markar maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 After this murder, people created a ruckus in the hospital
 maamla dilli ke jahangirpuri ilaake kaa he
 Where a 27-year-old youth named Jeet was going to work in a Block on Sunday night at around 9:30 pm
 tabhi teen agyaat hamalaavaron ne us parfiringkar di
 The victory took three shots in this attack
 fouran use babu jagjeevanram aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 After Jeet's death, angry families created uproar and sabotage in the hospital for several hours
 maamla yaheen nahin rukaa kuch logon ne ke-block main jeet ke ghar ke paas jhuggiyon main aag bhi laga di
 After this there is an atmosphere of tension in the area
 halaat ko dekhte hue maukey par baari sankhya main police bal tainaat kiya gaya he
 Deceased Witness Murder Case vahi is maamle kaa vaadi bhi tha
 It is feared that the strings of this murder may be connected to the old murder somewhere
 police ne maamla darj kar liya he
 But no arrest has been made so far
 police maamle kii jaanch padtaal rahi he
 Kaliyar Mansuri, the main accused responsible for the blast in Bhadohi district of Uttar Pradesh three days ago on February 23, is still out of reach of police
 police abhi tak use giraftaar nahin kar pai he
 In such a situation, the question is arising that where has he disappeared? Questions are being raised on the functioning of police in this matter
 beeti 23 farvari ko bhadohi jila ek dhamaake se gunj uthaa tha
 In fact, there was an extremely powerful explosion in Rotihan of Chauri on the varanasi-bhadohi main road, killing a total of 12 people
 jabaki teen log buree tarah ghayal ho gaye the
 Those who are being treated at bhu's Trauma Center
 ghatana main pashchim bengal ke malda nivasee 9 bunakar or bhadohi ke 3 log maare gaye the
 Which also includes 2 sons of the main accused, Kalyar Mansoor
 haalanki abhi tak police mansoor tak nahin pahunch pai he
 How and why the blast occurred can only be revealed by his arrest
 lekin police abhi tak use kyon giraftaar nahin kar pai he, yah apane aap main bada sawaal he
 However, sources claim that the police has detained him
 lekin police afasar is baat se saaf inkaar kar rahe hai
 He says efforts are on to arrest the accused
 ek ore jahaan desh main aparaadhik gatividhiyon ke badhane se janata pareshaan he vahiin is desh main ek aisa gaanv bhi he jahaan koi aparaadh hota hi nahin
 There is also a village in Korba district of Chhattisgarh where there has not been any quarrel or theft or robbery for the past 107 years
 is gaanv kaa ab tak koi bhi maamla thane nahin pahunchaa he, is gaanv kaa ek bhi, koi vivaad hota bhi he to nipataara gaanv kii chaoupal par ho jaataa he
 The government has declared it an ideal village
 jila mukhyalay se 60 kilometre dur basaa ek gaanv phooljhar desh ke anya sthanon se isliye alag he kyonki 1907 ke baad se is gaanv main na to marpet hui he or na hi chori kii koi ghatana
 Here the chaupal is the police station and the temple of justice
 yahaan panch parameshwar hi faisle kar vivaad sulajhaa lete hai
 This is the reason that Chief Minister Raman Singh has rewarded Phuljhar on being declared a crimeless model village
 soobe ke liye misaal bane phooljhar gaanv ke ek bujurg patel raamalaal kaa kahana he ki unhen ek bhi aisi ghatana yaad nahin he, jisamen koi maamla thane tak pahunchaa ho
 He is the head of the village from a young age
 unhone bataaya ki yahaan bhi chote-mote vivaad hote hai, lekin inkaa nipataara gaanv kii chaoupal par kar liya jaataa he
 He said that everyone considers the decision of Panch Parmeshwar
 yahaan kaa har jawan sipaahi he or un par hi gaanv va yahaan kii bahu-betiyon kii suraksha kaa daaromadar he
 There are Roznamchas in the police station here, but till date the name of a single person of the village is not recorded in them
 korba ke police adheekshak ratanlal dangi kehete hai ki phooljhar ek adarsh gaanv he, jise aparaadh shunya hone kii vajah se puraskaar se nawaja gaya he
 Villagers of other villages should also learn from this
 agar soobe main sabhi gaanv aise hi ho jaaen to chhattisgarh ko aparadhmukt rajya banane se koi roak nahin saktaa

 a fierce battle has started within the Congress about this
 congress ke do diggaj netaa padmavati vivaad ko lekar aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 Former Union Minister and Congress leader Shashi Tharoor described the Maharajas as cowardly, while Jyotiraditya Scindia has made a tremendous reversal
 unhone naseehat di ki shashi tharur ko pehle itihaas padhanaa chahie ki maharaajaaon kii kya bhoomika thi? saath hi aisi bayaanbaji se bachanaa chahie
 He said, "I am Jyotiraditya Scindia and i am proud of my past," i think he should study history, i am Jyotiraditya Scindia and i am proud of my past: Jyotiraditya Scindia on Shashi Tharoor's Maharaja remarkpic
 twitter
 com / n6s7aqzefu ‚Äî ANI (@ANI) November 17, 2017 Apart from this, BJP has also retaliated by the statement of Shashi Tharoor
 kendriya mantri smriti irani ne twit kar shashi tharur se poocha ki kya sabhi maharaajaaon ne british ke saamne ghutane teke the? shashi tharur kii is tippanee par smriti irani ne jyotiraditya sindhiya, diggi raja or amarinder singh se bhi jawaab maanga
 Earlier, all ministers including Union Minister Uma Bharti, Nitin Gadkari have targeted Sanjay Bhansali, accusing him of hurting feelings in the name of freedom of expression
 vahiin, padmavati vivaad par congress netaa rajeev shukla ne kaha ki jab is tarah ke halaat hote hai, to use sambhaalane kii zimmedaari sarkaar kii or I&B mantralay kii hoti he
 If anyone's feelings are hurt, the government and the film world should sit and find a solution
 aakhir shashi tharur ne kya kaha tha?film 'padmavati' ko lekar mache hangaame ke bichpurv kendriya mantri shashi tharurake bayaan par bavaal much gaya tha
 Tharoor had said - The fact is that every one of these so-called Maharajas who have lost their hands behind a filmmaker in Mumbai today had no concern about their honor when the British trampled their honor
 Were living
 ve khud ko bachaane ke liye bhaag khadey hue the
 So face this truth, so there is no question that we had collusion
 ek samaaroh main shashi tharur se sawaal kiya gaya tha ki unki kitaab 'en era of darkeness: da british empire in india' main pidaa kaa bhav kyon he, jabaki unki raay yah he ki bharatiyon ne angrejon kaa saath diya tha
 To this, Tharoor said, 'it is our fault and i accept it
 sahi myne main to main pidaa ko sahi nahin tehraata hum
 i have been very strict on myself in dozens of places in the book
 kuch british samikshakon ne kaha he ki main is baat kii vyakhya kyon nahin karata ki british kaise jeet gaye? or yah behad uchit sawaal he
 The social media response to Tharoor's statement got a strong response
 rajput samaaj ke logon ne tharur ko twit kar gheraa
 Controversy over Padmavati: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's remarks come at a time when a big controversy has arisen over the film 'padmavati', directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 kuch rajput sanghathanon ne bhansaali par itihaas ko tod-marod kar parosane or hindu bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 However, by releasing the video, Sanjay Leela Bhansali had also given the message that he has made the film with complete sanity and there is no scene like hurting anyone's feelings
 lekin iske baavjood deshbhar main padmavati ko lekar bavaal jari he
 In the conference room of the Congress headquarters on Tuesday, as the general in-charge of UP Ghulam Nabi Azad spoke about the alliance between the SP and the Congress, the supporters and opponents of the alliance gathered in the lawn, clashed with each other
 samaajawaadee party ke saath congress ke gathbandhan kii charchaa se congress ke kaaryakartaaon main hataasha he
 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the alliance would be announced in 24 to 36 hours, due to which all the Congress workers gathered in the Congress office got angry on hearing this
 unka kahana he ki samaajawaadee party bhasmasur he or jo bhi samaajawaadee party ke saath aayaa vah khatm ho gaya
 He alleges that SP is a party of goons and he committed hooliganism in UP for so many years, now when the Congress comes with him, it will cause huge loss to the Congress party
 yahi nahin 2019 kaa chunaav jeetna mushkil ho jayega
 The activists believe that after giving the slogan of UP Behaal for 27 years, the alliance means that Congress will not come to UP for 127 years
 gathbandhan ke samarthakon kaa kahana tha ki, bijepi ko rokane ke liye ye jaruri or sahi faisla he, vahiin gathjod ke virodhiyon kaa kahana he ki isse congress kaa nuksaan hoga or kareeb 300 siton se party kaa danda-jhanda gaayab ho jayega
 Opponents say that making Himilaco CM candidate, 27 years UP Behala's slogan and Rahul Gandhi's journey from Deoria to Delhi was just a show off? He says that the farmers demand letters were filled by spending lakhs from all the people in want of tickets, the rally was spent in the rally and travel

 The JDS leader was made the chief minister despite the Congress having fewer seats to oust the BJP from power

 For more details click here reliance jeeyo ke saste 4G phone launch ke baad se khabare aani shuru huin kii duusari companiyaan bhi aise mobile launch kar sakati hai
 Since Airtel has suffered the most from Jio
 isliye aisa mana jaataa rahaa he ki airtel jald hi saste 4ji phone kaa elaan kar saktaa he
 According to a report by Economic Times, Bharti Telecom can launch bundled offers on Diwali with a 4G smartphone of Rs 2,500
 iske liye company handset nirmaataaon se baatcheet bhi kar rahi he
 Reliance Jio announced the jiophone with a price of 0 rupees
 haalanki ise kharidne ke liye securitike taur par 1,500 rupee dene honge
 That is, Airtel will launch the smartphone for Rs 2,500, so it is possible that it will be heavy on the jiophone
 kyonki jiophone feechar phone hoga jabaki airtel kaa smartphone hoga
 ET quoted sources as saying in the report that Airtel will bring a smartphone of Rs 2,500 which will have bigger screen, better camera and performance than feature phone
 iske alaava yugers google play store ke jariye isamen ap install kar sakate hai
 Feature phones have their own scope, while smartphones have a lot of potential
 isliye customers 1,000 rupee zyada laga kar smartphone kii taraf dekhegaa
 However, it will also depend on how Airtel offers with this smartphone
 haalanki is keemat par badhiya fitures or spacifications dene kisi chalange se kam nahin he
 We have also told you earlier that after Jio, there is pressure on handset companies to launch cheap 4G phones too
 na sirf airtel balki vodaphone or edia bhi handset companiyon ke saath partnership karke saste 4ji phone launch kar sakate hai
 Unlimited data and calling can be given in it
 philhal is maamle main airtel ke pravaktaa ne kuch bhi kehane se manaa kar diya he

 anna hajaare ne shuukravaar, 26 agast, 2011 ko pradhanmantri dow manmohan singh ko jo khat likhaa he, vah is prakaar he
 
 
 Respected Dr
 manmohan singh ji, main aapkaa or sansad kaa bahut aabhaar maanata hum ki aap sabane hamaare andolan kaa sammaan kiya
 We have great respect for our Parliament
 hamaari sansad hamaare janatantr kaa pavitra mandir he
 i did not sit on hunger for any of my selfishness
 jis tarah aap log desh kii bhalaai ke liye kaam kar rahe hai, main bhi desh ke logon ke bare main hi sochataa hum
 i have no power of any kind
 main bas ek saamaanya aadmi hum or samaaj va garib janata ke liye kuch karne kii bhaavana rakhata hum
 This movement of ours is not against any person or party
 ham bhrashtachar ke khilaaf hai
 Want to change corrupt system
 yadi hamaare andolan ke dauraan mere athwa mere saathiyon ke dwaara kuch aise shabd kahe gaye hon, jisase aapako athwa kisi anya vyakti ko chot pahunchi ho to main sabaki taraf se dilgir vyakt karata hum
 It is not our motive to hurt anyone
 bhrashtachar kii vajah se desh main aam aadmi kaa jeena mushkil ho gaya he
 Our country is becoming infamous all over the world
 mujhe ummid he ki aane vaale dinon main is par roak lagegi
 We all have to work together for this
 niyam, kaayade, kanoon janata ke liye hai, janata ke upar nahin hai
 If we have to make some new rules or change some laws immediately to stop corruption, then we should not hesitate
 ek aam aadmi jab bhrashtachar kii vajah se pisataa he to mujhase bardaasht nahin hota
 There are three provisions in the Jan Lokpal bill to prevent corruption grinding the common man - Lokayuktas should also be made in every state through this law

 Anand Mohan, who has written a poetry collection titled Azad Kalam in captivity, realizes that the pen is always more powerful than the gun
 gopalganj ke tatkaaleen jila magistrate ji
 The former Bihar MP was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Patna High Court for instigating and instigating people for the murder of Krishnaiah and on July 10, the Supreme Court upheld the verdict
 is tarah 52 varshiya anand mohan ko ab jail kii salaakhon ke peeche se kavitaayen likhane ke liye kai or saal mil gaye hai
 This decision can surely mean the closure of all avenues for this Rajput leader and his political ambitions
 yah faisla dalit iees adhikari krishnaiya kii anand mohan kii uksaai ek bheed dwaara 5 disambar ,1994 ko mujffarpur main pitayee or goli markar hatya karne ke lagbhag 18 varsh baad aayaa he
 Krishnaiah was just 35 years old then
 2009 main chhattisgarh ke ek maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne faisla diya tha ki aaajeevan karawas kii sthiti main kisi sajayaftaa ko nunatam 14 saal kii kaid kaatani hogi or use 14 saal baad khud-ba-khud reeha kiye jane kaa koi adhikaar nahin hoga
 Apparently, Anand Mohan is set to stay away from public life for many years
 isse pehle aktubar, 2007 main nichali adaalat ne anand mohan ko maut kii sajaa sunai thi, lekin patna hycourt ne baad main uski sajaa ko ghataakar umrakaid main tabdeel kar diya tha, is faisle par supreme court ne bhi sahmati de di he
 Has Mohan lost his relevance in Bihar politics? Is all the way out for the leader for whom there is still sympathy in his community? The answer is yes and no
 mohan kaa rajnatik kariyar ab khatm ho chukaa he
 The punishment awarded to him has already made him unfit to contest the election
 ab, antim faisle se yah pakkaa ho gaya he ki ve aane vaale kai saal ke liye chunaav prachaar karne laayak bhi nahin rah gaye hai
 In a brutal profession like politics, sympathy is short-lived and loyalty ‚Äî if you do not have a very good status ‚Äî also decreases over time
 lekin bahubali netaaon kii bihar main ab bhi ek brands vailu he
 Just before the 2010 assembly elections, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar surprised everyone by visiting Mohan's ancestral home
 vahaan unhone khule taur par mohan kii maa se aashirwad maanga tha
 Nitish's meeting with Mohan's mother made Lalu Prasad's RJD so upset that he had sent his party's chief general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Ramkripal Yadav twice to Saharsa jail to discuss 'politics' with the former jailed MP
 'can be done
 inkaa mohan par koi asar nahin padaa
 After being proved guilty, Mohan, who was hoping for a sympathy wave, had fielded his wife Lovely Anand on the Congress ticket from Alamnagar constituency, from where his bail was forfeited
 bihar ke visham or guton main bante samaaj main, jahaan jati hi akasar raajnneeti kaa sabase bada nirnaayak pahalu hoti he, mohan ab bhi apni patni or rajnatik aakaaon ke liye kuch vot ikattha karne ke liye apni laachaari kii duhai de sakate hai
 If he sees any hope for himself in the political scenario of Bihar, then he will be well aware that his role will be a pawn
