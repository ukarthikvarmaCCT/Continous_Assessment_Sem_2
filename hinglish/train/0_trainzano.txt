 maamla vidhansabha tak pahunchaa gaya he or ab maamle kii jaanch ho rahi he
 Local BHMS doctor Babasaheb Khidrapure is suspected to be absconding
 yah maamla rajya ke bajet satr main bhi gunja
 Actually, the police investigating the case of death of a woman during an abortion had reached the drain in Mahesal village where she found these embryos
 tippaniyan Sangli Superintendent of Police Dattatre Shinde said the 'gang' was exposed after the death of a 26-year-old woman on February 28
 scindia ne kaha, "graminon ko mahila kii maut main kuch gadabadi kaa andeshaa hua jiske baad unhone police se sampark kiya or phir giroh kaa bhandaphod hua
 " udhar, maharashtra sarkaar kanya bhrun hatyaon ke liye mahilaon ko simavarti shaharon main le jane se rokane ke liye sanyukt prayaason kii jarurat kaa maamla karnataka sarkaar ke samaksh uthaaegi
 Maharashtra Health Minister Deepak Sawant said, "after the Sangli incident, the Maharashtra government will take up the case of female feticide with Karnataka to prevent such cases
 " mantri ne kaha ki mukhya sachiv sumit malik kii adhyakshata main mangalvaar ko ek samiti gathit kii gai he jo maamle kii jaanch karegi or aisi ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye vibhinn vibhaagon ke bich samanvay sthapit karegi
 Sawant said that there are also cases that women of Maharashtra are being taken to the border areas of Karnataka for abortion
 aise maamalon main maharashtra police sidhe vahaan jaakar karrwai nahin kar sakati he
 Sawant said, "we have asked Sangli District Medical Officer and Civil Surgeon to file their report on the Mahesal incident
 repart aane ke baad uchit karrwai kii jaaegi
 " sangli ke police adheekshak dattatre scindia ne kaha ki 28 farvari ko 26 varshiya mahila kii maut hone se ‘giroh’ kaa pardaafash ho gaya
 Shinde said, "the villagers suspected some disturbances in the woman's death, after which they contacted the police and then the gang was busted
" " On the other hand, the Maharashtra government will take up the matter of the need for joint efforts to prevent women from taking women to border cities for female feticide
 maharashtra ke swasthya mantri deepak saavant ne kaha, "sangli ghatana ke baad, aise maamalon ko rokane ke liye maharashtra sarkaar kanya bhrun hatya ke maamle karnataka ke saath uthaaegi
 "the minister said that on Tuesday a committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary Sumit Malik which will investigate the matter and coordinate between various departments to prevent such incidents
 saavant ne kaha ki is tarah ke bhi maamle hai ki maharashtra kii mahilaon ko garbhpaat ke liye karnataka ke simavarti ilaakon main le jaaya ja rahaa he
 In such cases, the Maharashtra Police cannot directly go there and take action
 saavant ne kaha, "hamane mahesaal ghatana par sangli jila chikitsa adhikari or civil sarjan se apni report daayar karne ko kaha he
 Appropriate action will be taken after the report arrives
 " Sawant said that there are also cases that women of Maharashtra are being taken to the border areas of Karnataka for abortion
 aise maamalon main maharashtra police sidhe vahaan jaakar karrwai nahin kar sakati he
 Sawant said, "we have asked Sangli District Medical Officer and Civil Surgeon to file their report on the Mahesal incident
 repart aane ke baad uchit karrwai kii jaaegi
 " maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis dwaara mumbai ke aare kshetra main metro rail car shed kii vakaalat kiye jane ke baad bhaajapa kii sahyogi shivasena ke pramukh uddhav thakare ne chetavanee di he
 He said that the fate of the scheme could be similar to the Nanar refinery in the Konkan region which was later scrapped
 uddhav kii is tippanee se bhaajapa or shivasena ke bich khai bad sakati he
 This is also because there is already a tussle between the two parties over the number of seats to be contested in the assembly elections
 in sab ke bich metro 3 line ke liye car shed kii yojana ko lekar bahes jari he kyonki iske liye aare kshetra main 2600 ped kaate jaaenge
 On a question asked about the car shed, Thackeray said that its fate will be like Nanar oil refinery
 thakare ke putr aditya thakare bhi metro kii is yojana kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 The proposed Rs 3 lakh crore refinery at Nanar in Ratnagiri district of the state had to be scrapped after stiff resistance from the Shiv Sena
 ravivaar ko siem fadanvis ne kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne spasht kiya he ki (aare) jameen van yaa jaev vividhta vaale kshetra main nahin aati

 kitabarbykula tu bangkocolekhakaes hossain jaidiprakashkayaharper colinsakimtah299 rupee (paper back adishan)peshey se patrkaar rahe es hossain jaidi jab mumbai mafia par kitaab likhte hai, to vah ek film kii tarah lagati he
 In this, the story, facts and analysis are all done in such a systematic and effective manner that after reading the book you become a walking mafia expert
 is baat kii baangi jaidi kii likhi pichhali kitaaben blike friday, mafia queens of mumbai or dongari tu dubai ko padhane ke baad purakashish dhang se mil chuki thi
 Zaidi's new book Byculla to Bangkok gave it a fresh seal
 yah kitaab dongari tu dubai kaa sikval he
 The basis of this book is a statement by the late Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray
 yah bayaan sena kii mashhoor dashahra raily main diya gaya tha
 In this, Thackeray called Mumbai's Hindu mafia don Amchi Mule
 inhen aamchi mule ke udbhav, vikaas or akasar paraabhav kii kahani sunai he jaidi ne
 Dongri to Dubai was more focused on the Muslim mafia in Mumbai
 or yah focus hi mafia kii duniya ke sabase bade or kukhyat naam daud ke pehle kii becoground samajhane ke liye tha
 It is read that a Nagpada boy first overpowered the Pathan Brothers of Dongri, then ruled the whole city and finally sat in Dubai to operate the abominable system of terrorism and crime
 magar dongari tu dubai main mumbai ke hindu mafia kaa zikr sirf jaruri ghatnaon ko vistaar se samajhane ke kram main hi kabhi kabhaar hota he
 In such a situation, Zaidi needed that this book be written to keep both sides of the crime in front
 kitaab ke pehle adhyay main zikr he us mashhoor encounter kaa, jiskaa aadesh diya tha us vakt mumbai ke adishnal police kamishnar rahe hasan gafoor ne
 This encounter was carried out by Sub Inspectors Vijay Salaskar and Pradeep Sharma, who later became famous through cinematic stories
 goliyon kaa nishaanaa bane do hitman subhash or ganesh kunchikuvare
 After this, the book reaches Arun Gawli, the uncrowned king of Dagdi Chawl
 kaise is chote kad ke mafia ne apni mil majdoor kii prishthbhumi ko peeche chhod robinhood numa chhavi sthapit kii or riel estate or political movement ke jariye apana samrajya sthapit kiya
 Gawli's courage was not only in his area but also in jail
 isaki baangi reporter ko tab mili, jab vah usase milane aurangabad kii harsul jail pahunchaa
 After the interview, there was a ruckus in Maharashtra and many officials were killed
 baad main gavali ne bhi reporter ko iske liye khari khoti sunai
 Zaidi provides all the details of the bra gang standing up against Dawood in full detail
 is gang ke mukhiya the babu resim, ram nike or arun gavali
 The gang got its name from the first letter of their names, Bra
 magar baad main police encounter or aapasi ranjish ke chalate ram nike or babu resim kaa kaam tamaam ho gaya
 Gawli is still intact and his daughter, nephew is also very active in politics
 gavali jail se rahakar hi bache khuche samrajya ko chalaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 The book reaches Gawli near Ashwin Naik, who was in the news again recently, after his arrest in a new case
 sabji vaale ke bete aswin ne oonchi talim hasil kii thi or vah aparaadh kii duniya se dur rahanaa chahta tha
 But in order to support brother Amar Naik, he also had to enter this world
 ek mashhoor shoot out main jakhmi hone ke baad aswin hameshaa ke liye apahiz ho gaya
 Zaidi meets him several times, collects information from his police and underworld sources, and then every possible gesture appears in the story that unfolds
 patni kii hatya karne vaala aswin, filmon kaa shaukeen aswin, shandaar ranneeti banane vaala aswin, bijanesman aswin
 After this, the book tells the story of some Killing machines of Mumbai like Sautya et cetera
 kaise saadhaaran si becoground vaale ye ladke bandook kii dhun par naachne vaale chhokare ban gaye
 How each of Mumbai's nobles trembled before his name and how he continued to strengthen the roots of the mafia sitting far away
 kitaab main mafia ke alaava pulisia karrwai kaa bhi baraabar byora diya jaataa he
 In addition to the Mumbai Police's Crime Files, the city's current and popular police commissioner Rakesh Maria also helped the writer greatly
 kitaab kaa sabase bada aakarshan he kabhi dauk kaa daanyaa haath rahaa don chota rajan
 The story of his name, the manner of his work and how he survived and flourished after his separation from Dawood
 sab kuch jaidi ne aise sunaaya he, jaise koi bujurg ankhon dekhi sabake ke saath kah rahaa ho
 If there is a slight interest in the Mumbai mafia or in the world of crime, then this book provides plenty of reading pleasure

 uddhav thakare ne mufti sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue sampadakeey main likhaa ki masarat alam ko chhodana kaa faisla hi galat tha
 Releasing Masrat is akin to treason

 Uddhav wrote, 'why is there a ruckus about the arrest of Masrat
 yah baat masarat alam ke pichley do din ke karname dekhakar samaj aa gaya hoga
 Masrat Alam was not kept in Kashmir jail because he had pocketed Omar Abdullah
 use isliye jail main rakhaa gaya tha kyonki usne kashmir ghati main hindustan virodh muhim chalaa rakhi thi or vahaan ke logo ko hindustan ke khilaafbhadakaane kaa kamkarta rahaa he
 Opposing the release of Masrat, Uddhav said that how can terrorists like Masrat Alam be released despite the bjp's nationalist views in Kashmir
 masarat alam ko reeha karke pakistan ke haath main mashaal dene kii koshish kii gai thi, kyonki yahaan masarat ko reeha kiya gaya tha or vahaan lakhvi ko reeha kar diya gaya tha or lakhvi bhi hindustan ke khilaaf jehar ugal rahaa he
 What did the Mufti government of Jammu and Kashmir achieve by releasing 'hariasta', the 'naga Kokuchana Hiraasta', Masrat Alam
 gilaani or masarat jaise naagon kaa fan kuchalanaa hi rashtriya suraksha kaa maarg he
 Masrat Alam is an agent of Pakistan and what Pakistan has to do in Kashmir is done through Masrat

 hamaare saath nahin rahane vaale dalon ne bhi aaj is bill par hamaara saath diya he
 The House should unanimously support this bill and resolution

 aaj tak 41 hajaar log vahaan kyon maare gaye? kiski niti ke kaaran 41 hajaar log maare gaye? hamane to koi niti nahin badali, nehru jo shuru karke gaye the, vahi chalati rahi
 Amit Shah said that why the youth of Rajasthan and Gujarat are not misguided, why is it only from Kashmir? Because there is no seed of separatism born from 370

 i wanted to wait till the case was over
 lekin cese ummid se bahut zyada lanbaa chal rahaa he

 jab bahut sari feeling, bahut saare log shaamil hon to apane jajbaton ko bayaan karnaa mushkil hota he
 i want to thank those who stood with me like a rock
 main jindagi ko samajhane kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 View this post on instagramtoday i complete 28 years of my life
 i want to take up this moment to share a few thoughts that have been in my heart for a while
 i wanted to wait to speak out until the case ended, but it's taken longer than expected
 i don’t know where to start from
 It is difficult to express some feelings when so many people, so many emotions are involved
 First, i want to thank those who have stood by me like a pillar of strength
 It has been a long journey that started when i was still trying to understand life
 i have been fighting the case in court for the last 6 years, with patience and respect, waiting for the trial to be completed
 In this process i have been called a murderer, a criminal, an abuser and so much worse
 i read these things about me almost every single day
 And my heartfelt effort has always been to be strong, respectful and ignore it
 But they still fill my and my loved ones’ heart with so much sadness
 i don't blame the people who call me names, because that's how i have been portrayed in public, but i'm not the monster that has been portrayed in headlines
 i know how easy it is to think the worst of someone and accuse them but it is exceptionally hard to prove myself innocent as there’s a procedure that we need to follow
 a procedure that has taken long enough that i have been made to feel guilty without even being given a fair chance to prove my innocence
 There have been accusations and assumptions but there has been no validation
 But, this is not about what others say
 This is about how i feel
 For as long as i can remember, my dream has always been to make my parents proud
 i have always tried to be a good son to them
 In the last 6 years, I've tried harder everyday to achieve this dream and to be positive
 So today, i am praying with my heart that our family can move forward, that the trial can come to a fair end and that i can give back all the love, support and strength i have received from so many of you
 Thank you to all of you who constantly send positivity my way
 You may not know it, but every single one of your prayers has helped

 Let me tell you, this delegation is being criticized, because it has come out that many of these members belong to right-wing parties in Italy, France and Germany

 aswin ne din kaa khel khatm hone ke baad kaha, ‘mujhe nahin lagata kispinron ko kaaphi turn mil rahaa thakhyonki ham ballebaajon ko utana nahin chaka paa rahe the jitnamohali main chakayatha
 But Jadeja did extremely well after lunch and kept a curb from one end which was our plan
 unhone kuch galat shot khele
 We were finally cautious that the last two to three wickets could add 50 to 60 runs
 ’ aswin or jadeja donon ab tak teen pariyon main 12-12 wicket hasil kar chuke hai lekin tamilnadu ke of spinner ne kaha ki saurashtra ke baayen haath ke spinner ke saath kisi tarah kii pratispardhaa nahin he
 He said, 'I did not think about it
 main apane kaam par dhyaan detaa hum
 When Jadeja bowls, i try to share my experience with him
 use apane majboot paksh or kamajoriyon ke bare main pataa he or yah bhi pataa he ki kya cheez uske liye kaam karegi
 He bowled quite accurately in the afternoon session
 ’out karne kaa 60-40 mauka detaa hoosvin kaa maananaa he ki jab koi nayaa ballebaaj krij par utarataa he to unke paas use out karne kaa 60 pratishat mauka hota he
 He said, 'whenever a batsman comes to the crease, i give myself a 60–40 chance to dismiss him
 mujhe lagata he ki mere paas pehle ballebaaj ke utarane ke 20 minute ke bheetar use chakaane kaa sarvshereshth mauka hota he
 Especially given the way the ball is missing from my hand, i am confident that in the first 20 minutes i can catch anyone
 ’ is aaf spinner ne kaha, ‘aaj dumini jab ballebaaji ke liye utraa to uske paas ranneeti thi
 He knew how to play the shot and i knew where to bowl
 aaj hamane acchhee gendbaaji kii or donon chor se kaaphi dabaav banaaya
 Ashwin also praised Ajinkya Rahane's effort in the spill
 unhone kaha, ‘jahaan tak slip kshetrarakshan kaa sawaal he to kaaphi badlaav nahin kiya jaataa
 We all have faith in Ajinkya and want him there
 aaj usne dumini kaa jo kaich lapka vah utana aasaan nahin tha jitna usne use bana diya
 Ashwin, the leader of India's spin attack, also said that he never felt that AB de Villiers would snatch the match from his JD
 aaj kuch lamhe aae jab vah (divilliars) galati kar rahaa tha
 Of course he knows this ground and he was playing shots with good angles
 use pataa tha ki use kahaan gend khelni he
 You need a good ball to get him out
 lekin kabhi bhi hamaare dimag main yah nahin aayaa k ek vyakti match hamaare se dur le jayega
 According to Ashwin, given the moisture in the pitch and the history of the Chinnaswamy Stadium of helping bowlers on the first day, Virat Kohli's decision to bowl first was right

 Such a mechanism should be created so that all kinds of communal violence in the country can be stopped
 bijedy ke tathagat sathpati ne kaha ki pichhali loksabhaaon main alpsankhyakon kii pairokari karne waalon ne vastav main unka kitna khyal rakhaa he, yah is loksabhaa ko dekhakar spasht ho jaataa he
 He said that God belongs to everyone, not in anyone's personal jurisdiction

 He said that there are two religions in the world, rich and poor
 sampradayik hinsa se keval garib prabhavit hota he
 Mohammed Salim of the Weapon CPI-M, who is making the contractor of religion, said that our motive should not be to incite feelings, but it should be stopped

 Chinese smartphone maker oneplus may launch the new smartphone oneplus 5T next month
 gijmochina kii ek report main kathith oneplus 5T kii tasviir post kii gai he jisamen dekhne main yah Oppo F5 jaisaa lag rahaa he jo haal hi main li hui thi
 Significantly, this is the second report this month about oneplus's smartphone
 pichhali report main yah baat saamne aa rahi thiki company agle saal kii shuruyaat main oneplus 6 launch karegi
 Since the last time the company launched oneplus 3T, the variant of its flagship oneplus 3
 lekin pichhali report main bataaya gaya ki company is baar One Plus 5T launch nahin karegi
 According to reports by Android Headlines, oneplus 5T is reportedly a version of Oppo F5 whose pictures are leaking
 yah bhi ek fact he ki opo, vivo or van plus ek hi parent company bibike electronics ke andar hi aati hai
 However, these three companies operate in an independent manner around the world
 tasveeron ko dekhen to aap andaja laga sakate hai ki isamen age tu age disple hogi yani bejal kam honge
 Android headlines have quoted sources as saying that this smartphone will have a 6-inch full HD display and its aspect ratio will be 18: 9
 iske alaava isamen qolkom snapadragon 835 procesar diya jayega or pichhali baar kii tarah is baar bhi company isamen dual camera seoup diya jayega
 oneplus 5, the flagship smartphone in markets like the US and UK, is also out of stock on the One Plus official website
 itnaa hi nahin kuch deshon main grey vairient uplabdh nahin he or sirf 6GB ram vaala soft gold vairient hi mil rahaa he
 Can it be expected that the company is now preparing to bring the next flagship by removing focus from oneplus 5
 haalanki oneplus 5 launch hone ke baad bhi market main purana oneplus 3T mil rahaa he
 So it can be a coincidence as well
 philhal company ne iske bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha he

 Chidambaram said, 'I have no comment to make about the stand of political parties about Rajoana
 is sambandh main dishanirdesh ekadam spasht hai
 Until the mercy petition is decided, punishment is not done
 ’ chidambaram ne bataaya ki rajoana kii dayaa yachika milane par hamane tatkaal punjab sarkaar kaa dhyaan akshirt kiya or unhen dishanirdeshon ke bare main bataaya
 But this does not mean that an agreement should be reached regarding the merits of the petition
 unhone kaha ki koi bhi sajayaftaa kaidi dayaa yachika daayar kar saktaa he yaa phir uski ore se koi ise daayar kar saktaa he
 Under the guidelines, both cases are treated the same and both are settled in the same way
 ’ sansad bhawan par hamale ke silsile main sajaa e maut paye afjal guru kii dayaa yachika ke bare main sawaal karne par chidambaram ne jawaab diya ki guru kii yachika antim faisle ke liye abhi raashtrapati ke samaksh vichaaradhin he

 a post shared by Varun Dhawan (@varundvn) on Nov 15, 2018 at 5:45 am PST deccan chargers or kings ilevan punjab ke khilaaf mili lagaataar do paraajayon ne beshak indian premier lig (ipel) ke is satr main mumbai indiens ke vijay abhiyaan ko roak diya lekin ab yah team jeet kii patari par lautne or plaof main jagah banane ke iraade se shuukravaar ko vankhede stadium main rajasthan royles se bhidegi
 Mumbai's team is third in the table
 uske khate main 16 ank hai
 He collected these points after the 10th match but despite 12 matches, he still has 16 points
 lagaataar do maichon main uski haar ne plaof main pahunchane ke uske sapane par beshak brake laga diya lekin is mukaam ko hasil karne ke liye uske paas abhi bhi do match hai
 Sachin Tendulkar's team will play two hands with Gautam Gambhir's Kolkata Knight Riders team in their last league match on May 22, after going on to play their last match in the IPL against Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne
 vaise rajasthan royles ke khilaaf jeet use plaof main pahunchaa degi lekin sachin kii team kaa lakshya nite rides ko haraakar talika main apni sthiti ko majboot karnaa hoga
 Given the manner in which Sachin's team lost against Kings XI and Deccan Chargers, it would not be right to say that his win against Warne is certain
 warn apana aakhri ipel match khelenge or unke saathi unhen jeet kaa tohfa dene ke liye puraa damakham laga denge
 Warne's team has collected 11 points from the 13 matches played so far and has suffered consecutive defeats from the last four matches
 warn kii team ke paas paane ko kuch nahin he lekin 2008 ke vijeta ke taur par apni pratishtha bachaane ke liye vah sachin kii team ko har haal main haraana chaahegi
 And then Warne would like to win this match also because in competitive cricket he will be playing against Sachin for the last time on the field
 vaise bhi warn ko is samay apni pratishtha zyada pyaari lag rahi hogi kyonki apni vidaai kii ghoshnaa ke baad logon se sahyog or samarthan kii guhaar lagane vaala yah khilaadi pich vivaad ko lekar rajasthan cricket sangh se apni ladaai haar kar kaaphi kuch ganvaa chukaa he
 This match is very important for Sachin's team because through this he will get the ticket to go to the next round
 rajasthan or nite rides se haar kii surat main uskaa sapana adhuraa rah saktaa he kyonki kings ilevan ne 14 ankon ke saath abhi se uske liye musiibat khadi kerani shuru kar di he
 Kings XI have one match on their account and their net run rate is also better than Sachin's team

 iskaa contrast reshyo 16:9 aspect reshyo ke saath 3 xxrep 5 0 :1 he
 The company had informed that the panels were taken from LG
 aise main puri tarah se screen kii baat karen to aapako ek behatar 4K disple kaa anubhav is tivi ke saath miltaa he
 Whether you connect it to HDMI or Miracast
 is tivi kaa screen kaaphi prabhavi he
 The viewing angle of this TV is also great
 is panel main kaaphi hai dephination quality main colors dekhne ko milte hai
 However, coming down to 4K, ie watching videos of Full HD and below quality, can be a bit frustrating
 saath hi halkaa sa is tivi main mirar effect bhi he
 That is, the screen reflects the things in front
 baharhaal, 43UHDXSMART TV kii screen bazaar main is range main maujuud baaki tivi modells se kaaphi behatar he
 And here it is definitely a winner
 thodi bahut kamiyaan hai jise rojaanaa ke upyog main nakaara ja saktaa he
 Performance: Android 4 interface of this smart TV
 4 kitcat par besd he or Thomson ke is tivi main Gmail, youtube, Twitter, Facebook or Netflix jaise eps difolt rup se die gaye hai
 The rest of the apps can be downloaded from the Aptiode App Store
 isamen lagbhag saare bade eps downlod ke liye maujuud hai
 Note not all
 lekin aapkaa kaam nikaalane vaale saare bade eps yahaan maujuud hai
 Talking about the rest of the specifications, it has 1GB RAM, 8GB internal memory and CA53 Dual Core 1
 4ghz procesar maujuud he
 Its interface is quite easy to use, here all the shortcuts are found on the screen itself
 haalanki home screen tak sidhe pahunchane ke liye koi dadicated batan maujuud nahin he
 But since this TV works on kitkat operating systems, which can be said to be older than models, this disappoints you
 yani aap normal or regular eps to isamen aasaani se oparate kar sakate hai, lekin heavi eps yaa kuch letest eps kaa saport aapako nahin miltaa he
 Also, you do not get support of some video formats in this TV
 aise main graahak MX player, VLC player jaise eps kii madad le sakate hai
 Apart from this, the processing of this 4K TV is quite good
 iske alaava youtube jaise eps ko tivi ke liye khaastaur par customij kiya gaya he, aise main jab aap ek video ko badalakar duusare main janaa chahenge tab aapkaa video band ho jayega
 As is not the case with smartphones
 jahaan tak remote kii baat he to isamen zyada shortkats die ja sakate the
 Verdict: The company has done a great job in this budget 4K TV on screen and display
 keval puraane android kaa saport diya janaa aapako thodaa sa niraash kar saktaa he
 Despite this, this TV plays the full role of Smart TV
 keemat is tivi kii sabase badi khaasiyat he jo ise dusron se alag banaati he
 That is, customers can put their money on this smart TV, which is available in the budget with the trust of Thomson brand

 With out any exception Each and every couplet recited during the 12 hour session was either wrongly worded, out of meter or mispronounced The Narendra Modi government of the Center is going to amend the Right to Information Act (RTI Act)
 monsoon satr main sarkaar is bill ko sanshodhan ke liye sadan main pesh karegi
 RTI activist and former member of the Information Commission M
 em
 Ansari believes that the central government wants to amend the RTI Act to reduce its stature compared to the Election Commission, so that the government can control it completely
 artiai activiston kaa daawa he ki sarkaar ne is sanshodhan ke liye na to sabhi pakshon se paraamarsh liya or na hi kendriya soochna ayog se sanshodhan kii baat kii
 The Center wants to change two basic elements by amending the Right to Information (RTI) Act
 pehla ye ki soochna ayog kaa kad chunaav ayog (isi) se kam ho jaae or 5 saal ke kaarykaal main parivartan par niyantran majboot kiya jaae
 India Today has a copy of the amendment proposed by the government, confirming that the government is going to abolish the pay, allowances and equality of service conditions of top officials of the Information Commission compared to the Election Commission
 bataa den ki vartmaan main soochna ayog ke ayukta kaa vetan supreme court ke jaj ke baraabar hota he
 If the government passes the bill, the information commissioner's salary will be under the control of the government, which can also be reduced
 prastaavit sanshodhan ke mutabik, 'mukhya soochna ayukta or soochna ayuktaon ko dey vetan or bhatte or anya niyamon or sharton ko centre sarkaar dwaara nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, the aim of other amendments is to revise the prescribed five-year tenure of the Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners of other states to the terms set by the Central Government
 sanshodhan ko nyaaysangat banane ke liye sarkaar ne bill ko lekar spashtikaran diya he
 The government says that there is a difference between the functions of the Election Commission and the Information Commission
 spashtikaran main yah kaha gaya he, 'chunaav ayog samvidhan ke anuchhed 324 ke khand (1) dwaara sthapit ek sanvaidhanik nikaay he, jabaki siaisi or rajya soochna ayog artiai adhinium, 2005 ke praavdhaanon ke tahat sthapit vaidhanik nikaay hai
 The government argues that salaries, allowances and other facilities to the Chief Information Commissioner, Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners of the states are equal to the Chief Election Commissioner, other Election Commissioners, the Chief Secretary of the state
 jabaki, kaary alag hai
 In such a situation a rational change in their salary and service is required
 purv soochna ayog ke adhikari or upie sarkaar dwaara kashmir main shanti vaarta ke liye niyukt sadasyon main se ek mem ansaari kehete hai ki sanshodhan kaa aadhaar doshapurn he
 He said that the right to vote without the right to information is useless, as the two are related to each other
 yahi kaaran he ki mukhya chunaav ayukta, mukhya soochna ayukta or supreme court ke jaj kaa kaarykaal or pad se hataae jane kii prakiya ko baraabar rakhaa tha
 He said that the government is working in an opaque way to undermine the foundation of the RTI Act which is considered an important step from the perspective of transparency and accountability
 professor ansaari ne kaha, 'siaisi ko unke kaam ke kaaran anya ke baraabar rakhaa gaya tha
 Under which they can issue notice to officers and others on the basis of seniority, seeking information
 lekin unka vetan kam hote hi unki sthiti bhi baaki adhikariyon ke mukaable gir jaaegi
 'first Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah said,' This step is an adverse proposal and it would be like compromising the autonomy of the Information Commission and Election Commission
 iske peeche tark he ki kanoon dwaara siaisi ko chunaav ayog ke baraabar kaa str nahin diya ja saktaa he, jo ki puri tarah se trutipurna he
 "he said," Most of the former government officials appointed in the Information Commission (CIC) have not got a 5-year term
 kanoon kahata he ki soochna ayog ke ayuktaon kaa kaarykaal 5 saal kaa hona chahie yaa adhiktam 65 varsh kii aayu tak hona chahie
 However, most officers arrive only at the age of 62 years
 isliye aayu avadhi ke kaaran unka kaarykaal lagbhag 3 saal he
 In such a situation, not correcting his specific tenure is nothing short of mischief
 ' It is said that nothing gets ahead of time and more than luck and this is right
 diarector rajkumaar hiraani kii film main kaam karne kii khwaahish har kisi kii hoti he, par mauka kab, kise or kis film main milegaa koi nahin jaanata
 Now take actress Anushka Sharma only
 anoushka ne raju hiraani kii film 'pike' main kaam kiya he or inhen ye role bhi ittefaq se mil gaya
 Hirani was eyeing his film Band Baaja Aur Baaraat and Raju felt that Anushka would fit in the role of 'PK', although Raju had not seen any other film of Anushka before
 in sabase zyaada dilachasp baat yah he ki anoushka sharma ne raju hiraani kii film '3 idiyats' ke liye audishan diya tha, lekin sillection nahin hua
 Anushka said that at that time i was modeling and used to audition
 hamen maaloom bhi nahin hota tha ki ham kiske liye audishan de rahe hai
 We would just go on the phone of the coordinator
 'pike' kii shooting ke samay ek sah-nirdeshak ne audishan kii tepe dikhaai to maaloom padaa ki maine '3 idiyats' ke liye audishan diya tha
 Anushka also said that late came but better
 raju sar ke saath kaam karnaa sapana puraa hone jaisaa he
 Talking about the subject, Raju Hirani laughingly said that i too came to know during the shooting of PK when one of my assistants showed the tape
 darasal, main nai cast ke saath '3 idiyats' bananaa chahta tha, jiske liye bahut saare audishan hue unheen main se ek anoushka thi
 But later Aamir Khan joined the film and changed his intention to make a film with a new cast and Anushka's character went to Kareena Kapoor
 ab anoushka khush hai ki '3 idiyats' na sahi raju hiraani kii film 'pike' kii vah heroin hai
 That is why someone has said that you did not make anything short of fortune making, when someone got what, it is a matter of fate

 From the day of swearing in of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the politics of Bihar has started eating
 ab jab rashtriya janata dal (argedy) or hindustan awam morcha (HUM) ne soobe ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko mahagathbandhan main aane kaa nyotaa diya, to bhartiya janata party ne mahagathbandhan ke netaaon ko ghar vaapasi kaa nyotaa de daalaa he
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said that Raghuvansh Singh is calling, but no one rides the sinking boat
 aise main unki naav par koun sawari karegaa? susheel kumaar modi ne argedy ke raghuvansh prasad singh or HUM ke adhyaksh jeethanram maanjhi ko endie main aane kaa khulaa ofer dete hue kaha ki unke liye darwaja khulaa hua he
 RJD National Vice President Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has asked all small and regional parties to unite to defeat BJP
 unhone nitish kumaar kii janata dal (you) ko bhi mahagathbandhan main aane kaa nyotaa diya he
 Jitan Ram Manjhi's Iftar party was attended by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, about which politics intensified and Jitan Ram Manjhi also invited JDU to join the grand alliance
 haalanki is prastaav ko jediu ne saaf taur par khaarij karte hue kaha ki mahagathbandhan main jane kaa sawaal nahin he
 JDU spokesman Sanjay Singh said that there is no question of going to the grand alliance
 bihar main endie puri tarah se ekajute he
 The RJD feels that one day Nitish Kumar will have to knock on the door of the grand alliance, because he is difficult to stay in the agenda with which the BJP is going
 argedy ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari kaa kahana he ki bijepi or kendriya grahamantri amit shah ke anuchhed 370 or 35-e hataane, ram mandir banane or saamaan aachaar samhita lagu karne ke mudde par nitish kumaar kya karenge? unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar ko bhagwaan bijepi ke khilaaf cheharaa banane kaa ek or mauka de rahaa he or jab nitish kumaar in muddon par endie chodenge, to argedy unke saath majbootee se khadaa hoga
 Apart from this, former Bihar CM Rabri Devi also said that if the Chief Minister of the state Nitish Kumar thinks of joining the Grand Alliance, then he will not mind
 rabari devi kaa yah sandesh us nitish kumaar ke liye he, jinaki party ke netaaon ne 30 may ko modi mantrimandal main shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya tha
 Nitish Kumar turned down Amit Shah's offer of a seat in the Modi cabinet and quietly returned to Patna
 iske baad jab 2 june ko nitish kumaar ne apane mantrimandal kaa vistaar kiya, to bhartiya janata party ko baahar rakhaa
 How Ram Rahim used to get abominations done to sadhvis in his camp
 isaki daastaan jab do bahanon ne sibiai afasaron ko bataai to unke rongte khadey ho gaye
 One of the two sisters whose testimony played an important role in getting Baba's punishment was a teacher in Ram Rahim's school
 bataa den ki 4may 2006 ko fatehabad kii purv sadhvi kaa statement sibiai ne ricard kiya
 She told that, 'in 1998 i joined Devi as Sadhvi
 iske baad main ram rahim ke shah satnam ji skool main teacher bani
 After seeing me, my real sister also joined the Dera as a Sadhvi
 shuruyaat se hi baba ham donon par gandi najar rakhata tha
 He changed the name of both of us to Nazam and Taslim
 lagaataa tha nite shiftbaba girls hostel ke bagal main apni gupha main rahata tha
 Outside the cave, he kept the sadhvis in night shifts
 us vakt duty raat 8 baje se 12 or 12 baje se subah 4 baje do shifton main thi
 My sister was also put in a night shift by Baba
 ek din usne meri bahan ko raat 10 baje gupha main bulaayaa gaya or uske saath rape kiya
 She kept shouting and screaming, but no one gave courage to Baba
 thodi der baad meri bahan roti hui gupha se nikali or hostel chali gai
 She could never tell her loss of life while living in the dera
 usne kai dinon tak apane man main baat dabaae rakhi
 One day when we were together, his pain was relieved
 usne bataaya ki baba ne mere saath balaatkaar kiya
 If you find out Baba's condition, then you wake up
 
 
 jab ham donon bahanon ne parijanon ko bataaya to ve agle din hi hamen waapas le gaye
 Fear of defamation also kept the housemates silent
 is bich kurukshetra kii sadhvi ke bhai or sirsa ke patrkaar ramchandra chhatrapati kii hatya ke baad hamaare parivaar vaale or dar gaye
 Due to this fear, the sister got married in May 2000
 lekin sibiai ne cese kii jaanch shuru kii to ram rahim kii karatuut saamne aa gai
 Law and order is becoming a headache for the Yogi Adityanath government of Uttar Pradesh

 In Mathura on Wednesday afternoon, criminals shot dead a bike-ridden youth in broad daylight
 vahiin bike savaar yuvak kaa saathi ghayal ho gaya
 The incident took place near the Mata Mandir of Barsana village
 jaankaree ke anusaar buudhvaar kii dopaher lagbhag 12 baje barsaanaa gaanv nivasee jameel or hike apane dost asif ke saath bike se kisi kaary se padosi gaanv ja rahe the
 The bike riders reached near the Mata Mandir that the already ambushed miscreants opened fire
 goli lagate hi jameel gir padaa
 He died on the spot, while a bullet came out touching his friend's neck
 vah bhi ghayal hua he
 The villagers immediately rushed him to the nearby hospital for treatment, where he is undergoing treatment
 do ghante baad pahunchi police, graminon ne kiya hangaamagraminon ne ghatana kii soochna tatkaal police ko di
 Despite the information, the police reached the spot after about two hours
 isse gramin acroshit ho gaye or hangaamaa kar diya
 Villagers sat on the road demanding immediate arrest of the attackers and strict action on the dead body
 espi city ne diya karrwai kaa aashwasanpulice jab shav apane kabje main lene main naakaam rahi or gramin shant nahin hue, tab shahar police adheekshak (espi city) or police mahakme ke anya aalaa adhikari maukey par pahunche
 SP City and other officials assured the action and explained the angry villagers somehow
 iske baad police ne shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhijwa diya
 The police have registered a murder case on the Tahrir of the deceased Jamil's father
 police maamle kii tahakikat kar rahi he
 The police claimed to have arrested the attackers soon
 dindahaade hui is ghatana se log dehshat main hai
 Kapil Sharma vs Sunil Grover Needless to say that Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover are the two biggest stars of Indian TV comedy
 donon kii kamedi kaa jaadu darshakon ke sir chadhakar bolta he
 Now both are not together
 donon kaa alag hona prashansakon ko akhar rahaa he
 Although both are currently appearing on TV with their latest new shows, but there are also shortcomings in both places
 ye jodi aapasi vivaad ke baad alag ho gai thi
 Sunil and Kapil said, "now everything is fine between the two
" " ummid thi ki ek baar phir donon kisi sho ke liye saath najar aaenge
 According to the discussions, when Kapil was bringing his new show in the old format on TV, he also tried to bring Sunil along
 haalanki kapil ke kai puraane saathi nae project 'da kapil sharma sho main saath aae, par kuch saathiyon ko lekar 'kanpur ke khurana' se sunil grover ne alag raah pakadi
 Sunil's show started before Kapil's show
 mana gaya ki sunil kii maujuudagi se kapil ke sho ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 However this thing seems to be proved wrong
 sitaron kii maujuudagi main kapil ke sho kaa pehla haftaa manoranjak rahaa
 Now Salman Khan and Family is the guest in the second week
 promose ke aadhaar par ye sho bhi hit mana ja rahaa he
 Overall, based on the initial episodes, we can say that Kapil seems to be slowly building his path

 a post shared bysunil Grover (@whosunilgrover) onmay 26, 2018 at 12:23 am PDT On the other hand Sunil Grover's show is not very much discussed
 haalanki uskaa formet bhi lagbhag vaisaa hi jaise tivi ke tamaam kamedi shoj kaa rahata he
 Is it supposed that Sunil Grover made a big mistake by not coming up with Kapil despite having a chance? Kapil's own stardom has been weakened by one failure after the separation from Sunil
 kuch vivaad bhi unki chhavi ko batta lagane vaale sabit hue
 But it is not that Kapil alone had to suffer the brunt of separation
 gaur se dekhen to algaav ke baad sunil ke saath bhi lagbhag vahi sab hua jo kapil ne bhugta
 However, there were no more controversies with Sunil than Kapil and his professional commitment is an example

 gujarat ke mehsana jile ke panchot gaanv main ek trust kii dekharekh main 70 kute rahete hai or sabhi karodpati hai
 According to the news of Times of India, 'madhi Ni Pati Kutariya', an organization for the welfare of dogs in the village, has been formed
 is sanstha ke paas 21 bigha jameen he
 Due to the formation of Mehsana bypass, land prices here have skyrocketed
 jameen kaa rate 3
 5 crores per bigha has been reached
 is tarah sanstha kii 21 bigha jameen kii keemat 70 karod rupee se zyada he
 The entire income from this land is for dogs only
 is tarah sanstha kii dekharekh main rahane vaala prayek kutta kareeb ek karod rupee kaa maalik he
 This tradition of donating land for the welfare of dogs is called 'kutariyu'
 trust ke adhyaksh chaganbhai patel ne kaha ki gaanv main jivadaya kaa lanbaa itihaas he
 It started with the donation of land by wealthy families, which they could not maintain
 patel ne kaha ki pehlejameen itane mahangenhin the, lekin haal main bypass ke nirmaan shuru hone ke baad yahaan jameen kii keemten kaaphi bad gayi
 Some Patel farmers started taking care of this donated land for dogs some 80 years ago

 Along with this, he said that organic cloth is the best option for newborn and period

 yahi vajah he ki synthetic pads kyon khatarnaak hote hai
 Let us tell you that since Akshay Kumar's film Padman came, Twinkle Khanna has been promoting sanitary pads to make women aware
 ise film ke pramotion kaa hissaa bhi mana gaya
 At the time, a campaign called # padmanchallenge was also run in which Bollywood celebrities participated in a big way

 Last week, this security firm informed both the instant messaging apps about this so that it can be fixed through security patch update 
 haalanki company ne yah bhi nahin bataaya he ki is suraksha khami se whatsap or telegram ke kitne acounts khatre main hai
 Sometimes such flaws occur only in select accounts
 check point ke adhikari oded vainnu ne kaha he ki is nai khami kii vajah se lakhon yugers ke acounts par hack hone kaa khatra mandara rahaa he
 The security firm says that this flaw allows a hacker to hack whatsapp accounts quite easily
 company ke mutabik, ‘maasoom se dikhne vaale photo whatsap par bhejkar ataikar acount ko apane control main le sakate hai
 From the photos, chats and videos of the account by taking control, you can know the history 'it is important that both whatsapp and Telegram provide end to end encryption in their chats
 daawey ke mutabik inke jariye kii jane vaali baatcheet sender or resiver ke alaava koi teesraa nahin dicode kar saktaa he

 They were seen shouting slogans against the Delhi government
 itnaa hi nahin dilli ke vidhansabha adhyaksh ramanivas goyal ke ghar ke baahar kooda bhi phenkaa ja rahaa he orasiyaasi daanvpenchamen fansi saileri ke chalate unhen or sarkaar ko ulaahna bhi di ja rahi he

 They have not been funded
 rojaanaa baithken hoti hai
 There are tweets

 rahul ne shuukravaar ko aarope lagaaya ki piem modi dwaara shuru kii gai notebandi '99 fisadi eemaandaar logon par bambaari' he na ki yah 'sargical strike' he
 However, the Congress vice-president did not say anything about the 'personal corruption of the Prime Minister' about which he had recently threatened to disclose
 kuch ghante pehle hi modi ne congress par deshhit se upar nijee hit ko rakhane ke aarope lagaae the or dilli main bhaajapa sansadeey dal kii baithak main ise bhrashtachar kaa samarthak bataaya

 yah kaala dhan par sargical strike nahin he balki bharat ke 99 fisadi eemaandaar logon par bambaari he'

 rahul ne sarkaar par sansad main manamaani kaa lagaaya aropaunhone kaha, 'bambaari kaa prabhaav parmaanu bam se zyada kharaab hota tha
 Narendra Modi has carried out a similar bombing by demonetisation and has burnt entire India

 These families do not keep black money in cash

 According to Rahul, black money is only six per cent in cash, while 94 per cent is in real estate, gold or foreign accounts

 Question- What will you say about demonetisation? Answer- i said that Muhammad bin Tughluq also ran his coin and stopped the old coins
 notebandi se pareshaaniyaan kaaphi hui hai
 Many people have lost their jobs
 ek sanstha ne bataaya he ki 20 lakh logon ko naukari nahin mili
 Question- Bitter gourd climbed on Neem? Answer- i said this because Bitter gourd is spicy in the same way and when it climbs on neem it becomes more spicy

 Question- What will GST say about Gujarat? Answer- i have worked in favor of GST, even when the government of Gujarat opposed it, i supported GST
 lekin is tarah se jiesti ko lagu nahin karnaa chahie
 The way GST has been implemented, it has brought a great disrepute

 i will not shut up puure desh main andolan hona chahie
 Question- There are big things about the issue of development, Congress's campaign is 'vikas gone mad'? Answer- There is a lot of worry in the minds of people in Gujarat at this time
 logon se baat hui to mujhe logon ne bataaya ki wo bahut chintit hai
 And the same thing was also seen in his talk
 aaj gujarat kii janata main chintaa vyapat he
 Question- Development has happened here, what do they believe? Answer- Why is there concern here
 kyonki logon ko takalif he
 i do not talk about businessman
 jiesti or notebandi kii vajah se kisaan pareshaan he
 There is a lot of trouble
 kahin naa kahin vikaas nahin hua
 Question- What will the casteist leaders like Hardik Patel, Alpesh, Jignesh say on the politics of development? Answer- Caste should not be talked about
 chunaav mudde par hona chahie
 Caste does not have a place
 wo janata ke mudde ke bajaay jati par apane mudde uthaate hai to acha nahin he

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special news letters With the dramatic events that took place in June this year, perhaps in the future, Shakespeare might have composed "ideas of June"
 america ne iran parmaanu samjhaute se alag hone kii ghoshnaa kii to uske fouran baad tivi par do virodhabhasi chhaviyaan dekhne ko milin
 One of them was the US reversal at the G-7 meeting in Toronto (june 7-9, 2018), in which Donald Trump was seen mocking his Canadian host and threatening his Western allies by warning them to increase customs duties
 yahi nahin, unhone rus ko phir se ji-7 main bulaane kii baat kii, jise 2014 main kreemia par kabje ke baad baahar kar diya gaya tha
 Surprising his old Western friends, Trump arrived in Singapore on June 12 for a summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which was specially designed for TV cameras
 vahaan unka dostana or garmjoshi bharaa rukh toronto main sahyogiyon ke prati kade tevar ke bilkul vipareet tha
 China was celebrating that this was a wonderful scene of Western domination in world politics, when the US announced a huge increase in the tax on sugar exports, the fun was spoiled
 trump ke "achche dost'' china ke raashtrapati shi jinping bhi raah main roda nahin atka sake
 Shortly thereafter, US National Security Advisor John Bolton, who is considered an icon of aggressive rightists in the US, met Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on 26 June 2018 to set out a us-russia summit in Helsinki in July
 kya in ghatnaon kaa vaaki koi sir-pair he?shuruyaat is baat ko samajhane se karen ki trump ke kaarykaal main koun-si puraani america ranneeti badlaav se achhuti rah gai
 However, among them, Trump must have adopted some new maneuvers
 america ke saamne ab china hi sabase badi chunauti he or yah aage bhi bana rahane vaala he
 America's biggest strategy now is how to prevent China from spreading further
 trump or unke salaahkaaron kaa maananaa he ki china ke ek bade pratidwandvi ke taur par ubharne kii sthitiyaan paidaa karne main america or pashchimi deshon kii badi bhoomika rahi he
 He argues that it was from here that China continued to get both technology and markets, making it powerful and posing a major challenge for the US in both economic and military spheres
 pashchim ke saath paraspar aarthik nirbharta kaa china ne zyada laabh uthaaya he kyonki china kaa tantra aisa he ki vahaan chijen sarkaar ke niyantran main rahati hai
 China has given them plenty of opportunities in China, which they later used to make maximum profit for themselves, to get a hold of the trade lobby of the West
 badale main pashchimi desh, khaas taur se america, ke liye china main utane avasar nahin ban paae hai
 a face-to-face trade war with China may also harm America's economic interests, but the United States believes that the damage to America is much less than the damage that China would do in this war
 iske alaava america takanic ke kshetra main apana dabadabaa ganvaata jaataa he, chaahe vah america ke hytech udyogon ke china dwaara adhigrahan kii shakl main ho yaa phir isaki bauddhik sampada kii sidhi or saral chori ke jariye ho yaa phir america bazaar ke videshi companiyon ke liye khule hone kaa phayda uthaakar isaki atyaadhunik takanic ko china dwaara hathiyaane kii shakl main ho, donon mahashaktiyon ke bich ke shakti santulan kaa palada dhire-dhire china ke paksh main jhukta chalaa jayega
 It has to be stopped before it is too late
 aakhirkaar, vaishvik mudra ke rup main america dollar or vaishvik bazaaron main america vittiya sansthaanon ke prabhutv ke kaaran america ko kisi bhi vyapaarik jang main, haalanki shaayad asthai ho, ek badhat to hasil rahati hi he
 Although one can deny these aspirations, but the reason behind the steps that Trump is taking is understandable
 china ko or kaabo main rakhane ke liye trump ne chini ganit ko do or jatke die hai
 The first of these is associated with North Korea
 china varshon se yahi jataata rahaa he ki uttar korea ke nirankush or aakraamak rukh ko vishwa main koi desh sambhalakar rakh saktaa he to vah bas china hi he
 He had also recently announced some trade restrictions on his neighbor, but these restrictions were not so strict as to shatter the existing power there
 lekin yah chini prayaas bekaar sabit hua
 Kim Jong-un initiated negotiations with his arch-rival South Korea and with his help — not China — began an unexpected and historic us-north Korea summit with the US
 china bhuchakka rah gaya or is khel main khud ko praasangik banane ke liye sangharsh karata najar aayaa
 Kim, who did not like Chinese power and always maintained a safe distance of one hand, was invited to the conference for the first time with a significant head of state honor
 uske baad, do maheenon ke bheetar unhen do baar aamantrit kiya ja chukaa he
 This shows the restlessness of China arising out of losing its hold in the game running in the Korea Peninsula
 ab yah baat kisi se chuphi nahin ki china ne pyongyang ke khilaaf apane zyaadaatar pratibandhon main dheel de di he or shesh pratibandh bhi jald hi hataa liye jaaenge
 The second setback is China's perception that the United States will maintain its strong military agreement with Japan, including giving Japan nuclear security, and will not let it fall short
 haalanki china is kshetra main aisi america sahyog sandhiyon kii joardaar mukhaalafat karata rahaa he
 But Trump has hinted at re-examination not only with Japan and South Korea but also with other old US partner countries on issues related to national security
 lihaaja, japan swatantra parmaanu shakti banane kaa nirnay karata he to usase hamaare kshetra ke samrik paridrishyon main naatakeey badlaav dekhne ko milenge or china is kshetra main jis aasaani se pantarebaaji karata aayaa he, use dhakka pahonchega
 That is why the Chinese attitude seems somewhat soft these days
 bharat ke liye yah acchhee baat he
 There should be no surprise about America extending its hand to Russia
 america main aisa hi mana ja rahaa he ki rus pashchimi khatre se zyada chintit madhya asia or purvi europea deshon main badhate chini atikaraman ko lekar he
 In such a situation, Russia can prove to be a good ally against China
 in ghatnakramon par paini najar banaae rakhni hogi or bharat ko saavdhaanee ke saath yah faisla karnaa hoga ki is kshetra main ban rahe nae samikarnon ke bich vah khud ko kahaan rakhata he
 Especially when indo-american relations have been seen as the "defining partnership" of this new millennium
 aaj vah baat zyada dikh nahin rahi
 Nikki Haley, the us's permanent representative to the United Nations, warned New Delhi strongly that India could face tough economic sanctions if India did not stop buying oil from Iran
 bharat or america ke videsh or raksha mantriyon ke bich prastaavit 2-2 vaarta ko teesri baar bhi sthagit kar diya gaya
 All this does not indicate the spirit of "decisive partnership"
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii chini raashtrapati shi jinping ke saath vuhaan main do divasiy anaupchaarik shikhar vaarta (27-28 april, 2018) or roosi raashtrapati putin ke saath sochi main ekadivasiy shikhar vaarta (21 may, 2018), in do lagaataar kootnithik prayaason ko trump kii asthir raajnneeti kii kaat ke liye bharat ke saath rus or china kii halchal ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 This is a good defensive initiative of India in this phase of historical transition but in my view India is once again becoming a "hung nation" as it was in the 2003-2007 era
 kisi ek taraf khadey na hokar balki trishanku raashtra ke rup main avasaron par najar rakhane vaale desh ke paas beshak kaaphi vikalp hote hai
 In the current era, India's global priorities are different, but India has opportunities to strengthen its external position
 isse pehle ki avasar ke dwaar band hone shuru ho jaaen, hamen saavdhaanee ke saath taiyaar kii gai ek ranneeti ke saath kadam aage badha dena hoga
 And this will remove us from the state of that hung

 At the same time, we have asked what arrangements have been made to monitor the accused who have been released on bail to keep them from committing the crime again
 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksha swati maliwal ne kaha, 'adhikari yah kaise sunishchit karenge ki is tarah ke jaghanya aparaadh phir se ghatit na hon? viksit deshon main jamaanat par chute hue aparaadhiyon kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhane ke liye majboot nigaraanee vyavastha hoti he

 The Congress on Tuesday targeted the government over the US decision to lift the exemption granted to other countries, including India, on the purchase of oil from Iran, and said it was a "diplomatic and economic failure" of the Modi government

Modi ji is not telling the public that he has instructed the oil companies not to increase the prices of petrol and diesel till May 23 to throw dust in the public's eye and garner votes

 The court convicted him of plotting the murders of protesters killed during last year's rebellion
 refaat ne adli ke chah sahaayakon ko haalanki bari kar diya
 The decision came after 49 court sessions over the past 10 months
 bibisi ke mutabik 84 varshiya mubarak saal 2011 main vibhinn deshon main hue vidrohon ke baad sajaa paane vaale pehle rashtradhyaksh hai
 In a case related to the land deal, Mubarak and his two sons Ala and Gamal and businessman Hussein Salem were acquitted
 adaalat ne kaha ki yah 10 saal purana maamla he jis par kanoonee karrwai kaa samay biit chukaa he
 Mubarak was also acquitted in another case of abuse of power

 He said, 'moral policing is not the intention of the government from anywhere

 The Union Minister further said that behind the ban, there is no attempt to snatch the right to freedom of expression of any citizen on the Internet
 unhone kaha, 'main un aaropon ko khaarij karata hum, jisamen is kadam ko talibanikaran bataaya ja rahaa he

 He reiterated his point saying that his government is in favor of freedom on social media and internet

 The court said that doing so is a violation of Article 21, which gives personal freedom to any citizen

 Chief Justice HL Dattu denied the ban, saying, "any such interim order passed by the court is a violation of Article 21, which gives personal liberty to any citizen
" agar aisa hota he to kal ko koi bhi vayask aakar yah kah saktaa he ki aap mujhe mere kamare main charadivari ke andar porn dekhne se kaise roak sakate hai?'echel dattu kii ore se yah tippanee us samay ai, jab indore ke ek vakil kamalesh vaasavani ne ek piiel daakhil kar sabhi porn cites par bain lagane kii maang kii thi

 in / jammu kashmir main rajyapal shashan lagu hone ke bichbijepi ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki rajya main sthiti saaf ho rahi he or party kii pidipi or neshnal conference donon se baat chal rahi he
 The BJP said that it still wants to form the government there
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne khud kaha ki unki party kashmir main NC or PDP se baatcheet kar rahi he or aage jo bhi tay hoga vah media ko samay aane par bataa diya jayega
 BJP said that Governor's rule was imposed in Jammu and Kashmir after the time limit stipulated by the Constitution and Omar Abdullah expressed their willingness to assume the responsibility of caretaker Chief Minister
 kendriya mantri or varisht bijepi netaa ravishankar prasad ne is bare main raay puche jane par kaha, jammu kashmir main sthiti saaf ho rahi he, lekin is silsile main vah bina vichaar kiye koi tippanee nahin kar sakate
 Regarding imposition of Governor's rule, Prasad said, there is a constitutional limit of time (in this case it is till January 19) and Abdullah was reluctant to continue as caretaker Chief Minister
 unhone kaha ki, ye vyaavhaarik mudde hai jinhen dhyaan main rakhana hoga kyonki sthir sarkaar ko lekar sthiti spasht hona baaki he
 In Hyderabad today, BJP President Amit Shah said, "talks are going on in Kashmir with our two parties (national Conference, PDP)"
 jab bhi koi ghatnakram hoga, ham aapako bataa denge
 We are trying to form a BJP government in the state
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne yahaan kaha ki bijepi jammu kashmir main sthir sarkaar chaahati he tathaa uske liye baatcheet chal rahi he
 Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that parties in Jammu and Kashmir have received such a mandate that no government has been formed so far
