 India has given a big gift to the Hindus of Pakistan
 modi sarkaar ne 431 pakistani nagarikon ko long turm vija dene kaa faisla kiya he, jinamein adhikaar hindu hai
 Pakistani citizens will be able to buy property, not only will be given long term visas, but also they will be able to get PAN and Aadhaar card
 jisase inhen bharat main property kharidne kaa bhi adhikaar hoga
 a Home Ministry official gave this information to the news agency
 adhikari ne bataaya, 'grih mantralay ne pichley maheene (sitambar) 431 pakistani nagarikon ko dderghaavadhik vija pradaan kii he
 They are from the minority communities of that country '
 modi sarkaar kii nai niti ke tahat madaddarasal, centre sarkaar kii nai niti ke tahat pakistan, afghanistan or bangladesh ke alpsankhyak samudaayon ke jo log long turm vija par bharat main rah rahe hai, unhen parivaar kii jaruraton ko puraa karne or rojgaar karne ke liye rihaayshi property kharidne kii anumati he
 Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Zoroastrian and Christian are prominent among these minority communities
 haalanki, aise logon ko raksha se jude kshetron sahit pratibandhit yaa surakshit kshetron ke aasapaas achal sampatti kharidne kii anumati nahin he
 Such communities can obtain PAN card, Aadhaar number, driving license, self-employment
 iske alaava ve jahaan rah rahe hai, vahaan mukt hokar gum sakate hai
 They can also transfer long-term visa documents from one state to another

 The Uttar Pradesh government is now seen to be hard on the accidents caused by broken roads and pits
 sarkaar ne aadesh jari kiya he ki agar sadak main gaddhon ke chalate hue haadase main kisi kii jaan jaati he to ejeeniyar or thekedaar donon par gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa mukadmaa chalegaa
 In the last year, more than 1500 people have died in UP due to poor road accidents
 jabaki lagbhag itane hi musafir ghayal ho chuke hai
 But now in order to get people out of this problem, the DM has been ordered by the Transport Commissioner that now all the engineers and contractors will be prosecuted for irresponsible murder whose negligence in road repairs leads to death of someone
 parivaahan ayukta ke rabindra nayak ne kaha, 'hamaara makasad logon ko samvedansheel bananaa he taakilog gadde na khodenor agar khoden to use shaam tak bhar den
 But if such people or the concerned contractor, engineer did not supervise these roads and someone died after falling, then they should be prosecuted under 304-A
 'no accident de' par nahin hoti kisi kii mautarvindra nayak ne kaha, 'jab ham no-accident de manaate hai to us din ek bhi durghatana nahin hoti he
 At least there is no death
 itnaa sirf logon ko jaagruk karne se hua he
 'he said,' 16 thousand people die in an accident in a year
 to agar jaagarukta se log batch sakate hai to log jaagruk hon, sakhti se trephic niyamon kaa paalan karen or accident se bachein, ham to yahi kahenge
 'engineers argue, roads are broken due to overloading
 Departmental engineers are not willing to accept this logic of the government unconditionally
 unka kahana he ki agar sadaken overloding kii vajah se tuutati hai to iske liye ejiniyaron yaa thekedaaron ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Different roads are built according to load and fixed standards
 lihaaja isaki jimmedaari transport vibhaag kii pravartan tiimon ko nibhaani hongi
 Without it, it would be unfair to put the entire responsibility of filling the pit on the road

 unhone kaha ki dangon se jude kai sawaal hai jinka jawaab mukhyamantri hi de sakate hai
 Sinha asked how the truth would be revealed if there was no investigation or cross-examination
 He also demanded that three members of the chief minister's staff be cross-examined
 ucch nyaayalay ke faisle par apni pratikriya main sinha ne kaha ki vah ucchtam nyaayalay kii sharan lenge

 trivedi ke anusaar, yah nirnay ayog ko karnaa he ki poochtacha ke liye kise bulaanaa chahie or kise nahin
 He said that the court should leave it to the Commission to decide whether to call Modi or not, as the Commission works under the rules and procedures of its Act

 ji haa, ek desh aisa bhi he or uskaa naam he saudi arab
 Here girls are not allowed to play in the field
 lekin khabar he ki ab isaki aazaadee de di gai he
 Now she can play in schools
 # FIFA World Cup shuru hone ke 20 saal baad bharat hua qualifi, jaane phir kyon nahin khel sakaa machadrasal, saudi main 65 fisadi mahilaon kaa vajan saamaanya se zyada he
 That means 65 percent of the women there are prone to obesity
 is babat vahaan ke shiksha mantralay ne agle shaikshik satr se sabhi sarkari skulon main ladakiyon ke liye shaareerik shiksha (physical ajukeshan) kaa vishay anivaary kar diya he
 However, women in Saudi had long been demanding to participate in their rights and sports
 jisane aalu se vodaka banaakar duniya ko chaunkaaya, aaj unka janmdin he
 
 
 Increasing obesity due to low interest of people in sports and physical activities has been a cause of concern of the government
 saudi main mahaj 13 pratishat aabaadi hi hafte main ek din vyaayaam karti he
 The government wants to make it 40 per cent, so under the Vision 2013, the government is taking several steps to increase the interest of the people of the country in sports
 140 saal kaa hua wimbledon, google ne kuch is andaaj main kiya celibratahaalanki maujuuda sarkaar ke shiksha mantralay ne yah baat bhi spasht kar di he ki ladakiyon ko shaareerik shiksha kii padhai dhire-dhire or islamic sharia kanoonon ke anusaar hi karwaai jaaegi
 Please tell that Saudi has a very conservative mindset about women
 mahilaon ko ghar se baahar nikalne par khaas niyamon kaa paalan karnaa hota he
 For example, they appear in tight clothes, the whole body is covered, etc
 yahi nahin, kattarpanthi mahilaon ke gaadi chalaane kaa bhi virodh karte hai
 The entrance of women and men also differ in public places
 pehali baar 2012 ke landan olympic main mahilaayein saudi arab kii team kaa hissaa baniin thi

 In such a situation, the feelings of Indians are constantly on the news related to these countries
 ab agar kisi mukaable main bharat kaa koi betaa china or pakistan donon ko haraa de, to jaahir he ki har kisi ke liye ye ek badi baat hogi
 Perhaps this is why Neeraj Chopra was getting the medal and the national flag of the three countries was going up
 jab tasviir main bharat number ek, china number do or pakistan number teen he
 So social media celebrated the victory of Neeraj openly

 viraat kohli ko australia ke khilaaf disambar main hone vaale pehletest match main captaini kii jimmedaaridi gai he
 Former Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin believes that the leadership ability of this young player should not be judged based on the outcome of this one match
 ajaharuddin ne kaha ki aapako ek test ke aadhaar par kohli kaa akalan nahin karnaa chahie
 Because no one should understand that they got the captaincy due to Dhoni's injury
 isliye mujhe lagata ki hamen ek test ke aadhaar par unka akalan nahin karnaa chahie
 We should leave them alone
 unhen apane kaam kaa majaa lene do or unke balle ko jawaab dene ko chhod dena chahie
 Confident of the chances of the Indian team in Australia, Azharuddin said that the Indian team looked much better than the Australian team and India should win the Test series
 unhone kaha, 'hamaari team bahut acchhee he or agar ve austrailia ke khilaaf nahin jeet pate hai to mujhe niraashaa hogi
 i don't think the Australian team is as strong as it used to be two or three years ago
 warner or ek yaa do khilaadiyon ko chhodkar uske paas koi aisa khilaadi nahin he jo antar paidaa kar sake
 On the other hand India have very good players

 He said that this gives you an idea of the Australian wicket and the conditions, so i believe it is a good sign
 aapako ise nakaaratmak nahin balki sakaaratmak rup main lenaa chahie

 madras hoicourt ne camel hasan kii film 'vishvarupam' se pratibandh hataa diya he
 During the debate, Kamal Haasan's lawyer said that it is unconstitutional to stop the screening of a film passed by the censor board
 ullekhneey he ki pratibandh ke maamle main sunwaayee karne vaale nyaayamurti ke venkatraman ne pichley shanivaar ko 'vishvarupam' dekhi thi, or somvaar ko unhone camel hasan ko salaah di thi ki vah tamilnadu sarkaar ke saath is mudde ke ek 'sweekaarya or shantipurna' samaadhaan ke liye harsambhav sambhaavnaaen tatolen
 With this, the Madras High Court deferred its decision in this regard till Tuesday
 is bich, karnataka police dwaara paryaapt suraksha kaa aashwaasan die jane ke baad distributaron ne nirdeshak-abhinayta camel hasan kii mega bajet film 'vishvarupam' ko aakhirkaar rajya main release kar diya
 HD Gangaraju, the film's only distributor in Karnataka, said that the state police assured them of providing adequate security to ensure a peaceful performance of the film, following which 'vishwaroopam' along with the matinee show on Tuesday, including 17 theaters in Bengaluru across the state Has been released in 40 theaters, and 17 all theaters in Bengaluru are going to Housefull
 isse pehle, nyaayamurti ke venkatraman ne camel hasan ko yah bhi salaah di thi ki 'desh main kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti
 
 
 And keep the unity of the country in mind, because there should be no disharmony between communities because of it (of the film)
 adaalat ke baahar camel hasan ke vakil pies raaman ne kaha tha, hamane jila colector ke aadesh ko chunauti di he or mukhya yachika ke saath maamle kii sunwaayee kii maang kii he
 On the court's advice of a 'goodwill' solution, Raman said, the court has only remarked that since Kamal Haasan has returned to the city, he can try for a settlement
 yah adaalat kaa aadesh nahin he
 Raman said, we have got seven-eight orders (of district collectors)
 ham keval unhen chunauti de rahe hai
 After meeting the rest, we can challenge them too
 aisa hi ham alag se puduccheri main bhi karne ja rahe hai
 Asked about the release of the pirated DVD of the film, he said, "we have not said anything about it in court
" keval aapako (media ko) kahana chahie ki pirated dividi kisi ko na milen
 The comments camel hasan ke bhai chandra hasan ne adaalat ke baahar samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki saptahanth kii chhuttiyon ke dauraan hua nuksaan kareeb 30 se 80 karod rupee kaa ho saktaa he
 We do not know if cinemas will be available later
 
 
 ham yah bhi nahin jaanate ki kya saptaah ke bich main cinemahal ise pradarshit karnaa chahenge yaa agle saptaah tak theatre uplabdh ho paaenge
 Asked whether the ban is a freeze on freedom of expression, Chandra Haasan said, "it is a matter of law and there are judges to explain it
" yah puche jane par ki kya film kisi bhi tarah muslimon kii bhaawanaaon ko aahat nahin karti, chandra hasan ne kaha, film nirmaan ke dauraan ham is baat ko lekar aashwast the ki isse kisi bhi samudaay kii bhavanaaen aahat nahin hongi
 He was asked if he would remove the scenes that the Muslim community considered objectionable, Chandra Haasan's answer was, the first thing i cannot imagine is any scene which he would find objectionable
 duusari baat yah he ki aise drishyon ko kaatna yaa na kaatna nirdeshak kaa visheshadhikaar he to phir yah faisla camel hasan kaa hoga, nirmaataa kaa nahin
 It is noteworthy that Justice k Venkataraman, who was hearing the ban case, saw 'vishwaroopam' last Saturday, and on Monday he advised Kamal Haasan that he would work with the Tamil Nadu government for an 'acceptable and peaceful' solution to the issue
 Find all possible possibilities
 iske saath hi madras hoicourt ne is bare main apana faisla mangalvaar tak ke liye taal diya tha
 Meanwhile, the distributors finally released director-actor Kamal Haasan's mega budget film 'vishwaroopam' in the state after Karnataka police assured adequate security
 karnataka main film ekmaatr distributor echdi gangaraju ne bataaya ki rajya police ne unhen film kaa shantipurna pradarshan sunishchit karne ke liye paryaapt suraksha uplabdh karnaa kaa aashwaasan diya he, jiske baad 'vishvarupam' ko mangalvaar ko metini sho ke saath bengaluru ke 17 cinemagharon sahit rajyabar main 40 theatreon main release kiya gaya he, or bengaluru ke 17 sabhi cinemaghar housephul ja rahe hai
 Earlier, Justice k Venkataraman had also advised Kamal Haasan that 'the law and order situation in the country
 
 
 or desh kii ekta' ko dhyaan main rakhen, kyonki isaki (film kii) vajah se samudaayon ke bich koi vaimnasy nahin hona chahie
 Outside the court, Kamal Haasan's lawyer PS Raman had said, "we have challenged the order of the district collector and sought the hearing of the case along with the main petition
" 'sadbhavnapurna' samaadhaan kii adaalat kii salaah par raaman ne kaha, adaalat ne keval yah tippanee kii he ki camel hasan chunki shahar laut gaye hai to vah samjhaute kii koshish kar sakate hai
 It is not a court order

 We do not even know if the cinematographer would like to display it in the middle of the week or the theater would be available by the next week

 Asked whether the film does not hurt the sentiments of Muslims in any way, Chandra Haasan said, "during the production of the film, we were convinced that it would not hurt the sentiments of any community
" unase poocha gaya ki kya muslim samudaay jin drishyon ko aapattijanak maanegaa, unhen ve hataayenge, is par chandra hasan kaa jawaab tha, pehali baat yah he ki main aise kisi drishy ke bare main kalpana nahin kar saktaa, jise ve aapattijanak maanenge
 Secondly, whether or not to cut such scenes is the director's prerogative, then it will be decided by Kamal Haasan, not the producer

 kyon wo yahaan se kisi or car main baithe

 lekin kya aap jaanate hai, is trishul kaa apana hi mahatv he
 The trident of Lord Shiva is hiding many secrets behind him
 is trishul se puure sansar kii gatividhiyon par asar pad saktaa he
 Today, tell you about this trident of Bholenath and tell its glory
 vaise to trishul hindu manyata ke anusaar kai devi devtaa trishul dhaaran karte hai
 But when Lord Shiva holds it, then its significance is different
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki jab bhagwaan shiv pehali baar is dharti par prakat hue, tab unke saath raj, tam or sat gun kaa bhi janm hua
 Mahadev's trident also reflects three forms of nature - invention, maintenance and destruction
 teenon kaal- bhoot,vartmaan or bhavishya bhi is trishul ke andar samaate hai
 Not only this, the form of Trimurti - Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh can also be seen in the trident
 manyata to ye bhi he ki trishul ke chalate sabhi nakaaratmak takatein ham se hameshaa dur rahati hai or ham aadhyatmik jivan kii taraf agrasar hote hai
 The trident also ends the pride of a person and gives him a chance to come closer to his lord
 wo is bhautik jivan ko chhod satya kii anubhuti karata he
 Explain that the trident in the hand of Shiva means that he is above all the three qualities, that is, Nirguna
 kai logon ko aisi bhi dharna hoti he ki mahadev kaa trishul tabaahi kaa pratik hota he
 But let me tell you, along with the destruction, this trident also frees you from all the troubles
 trishul aapako satya kaa maarg dikhataa he or us par chalane ke liye protsahit bhi karata he
 In easy words, salvation can be attained through the trident

 The well-known industrial house of the Tata group has once again joined hands with Singapore Airlines to launch a new airline service
 namak se lekar saftware banane vaale 100 arab dollars ke tata samooh kii holding company tata sans ne singapore airlines ke saath nai airline company ke liye sahmati gyaapan (emoyu) par hastakshar kiya he
 Tata Sons will hold 51 per cent stake in this company, while Singapore Airlines will hold 49 per cent
 nai airline shuru karne ke liye donon bhagidaar 10 karod dollars (620 karod rupee) kaa shuruaati nivesh karenge
 Sources said that after getting the necessary approvals, it will start by next year
 tata samooh ne kaha he ki usne iske liye videshi nivesh sanvardhan board (exipibi) ke paas manjuuri ke liye aavedan kiya he
 Even 18 years ago, there was such a failed attempt between the two
 isse pehle is saal farvari main tata samooh ne malaysia kii air asia ke saath bajet airline shuru karne ko bhagidaari kii he
 The board of the new airline will initially have three members

 The chairman of the board will be Prasad Menon, nominated by Tata Sons
 tata or singapore airlines kaa bhartiya naagarik vimaanan kshetra main pravesh karne kaa yah teesraa prayaas he
 Earlier, in 1995, the Tata group applied for a new full aviation service to the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which was approved a year later, but later in 1997, the change in civil aviation policy could not start the venture
 niti main gharelu airline main videshi vimaanan companiyon ko equity lene se roak diya gaya tha
 The government has changed the investment policy last year, allowing foreign airline companies to invest 49 percent in domestic airlines
 varsh 2000 main tata or singapore airlines ne milakar air india kii 40 pratishat bhagidaari ke liye boli lagaai lekin disambar 2001 main isse peeche hat gayi
 Disinvestment of Air India could not happen due to political opposition
 menon ne kaha, ‘tata sans kaa moolyankan he ki bharat main naagarik uddyan kshetra main nirantar vruddhi kii sambhaavnaayen hai
 We now have a chance to launch a world class new full airline service in India
 ham isko lekar prasann he ki is udhyam ke liye ham vishwa vikhyath singapore airlines ke saath bhagidaari kar rahe hai
 Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong also expressed similar views, saying, "we have always had strong confidence in the growth prospects of the aviation sector in India
 vimaanan bazaar ke bhavishya ke vistaar main ham tata sans ke saath bhagidaari ke avasar ko lekar utsahit hai
 "after the recent liberalization in the aviation sector in India, this is an appropriate opportunity to provide a new air travel option for customers in the aviation sector," he said
 goh ne kaha, ‘hamen puraa vishwaas he ki prastaavit sanyukt udhyam airlines se bazaar main maang badhegi or bharat ko aarthik laabh milegaa
 Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh told reporters, "aviation sector rules do not prevent Tata from participating in two companies
 yah kaam sebi or kaperarat kaary mantralay kaa he ki vah is tarah ke udhyam ko manjuuri den
 Mukund Rajan, a member of the General Executive Council of Tata Sons, said, "tata Sons will fully participate in the management and operation of the proposed airlines
" samooh bhartiya audyogic kshetra kii apni samaj kaa puraa phayda uthaayegaa or apane lambey anubhav kaa is bhagidaari ko sarthak banane main upyog karegaa

 But the Tata group itself will be in the driver's seat in the newly proposed airlines

 It was a big disappointment
 pataa nahin kyon laga ki aabid sach nahin bol rahaa he
 Perhaps he did not like to do our accounting last night
 uske or hamaare hisaab se jo paise ban rahe the usamen 500 kaa antar tha
 i do not know, i never understood Abid
 barish ke kaaran shikara market jane kaa program bhi radd karnaa padaa
 We had a 4:30 pm flight
 pehle sochaa tha ki aakhri din kaa bhi upyog ho jayega
 But it did not happen
 raste main jaan bekri se kuch kukies pack karaae
 Took some chocolates for Abid's daughter
 srinagar airport par aapako kam se kam 3 ghante pehle pahunchnaa hota he
 Because here you have to go through many stages of security check
 pehali jaanch to kareeb aadha kilometre pehle hi ho jaati he
 Have to get off with luggage
 eksre or jaanch ke baad phir gaadi par baithkar aage janaa hota he
 Meanwhile, the car is also examined
 uske baad airport kii apni jaanch prakriya hoti he
 Finally, you also have to identify your baggage

 Abid brought us to the airport at 12 o'clock
 hamaari flite kareeb saadhe chaar ghante baad thi
 Got angry but what could be done
 khaskar karpet kaarkaana nahin ja paane ke kaaran
 The question came to my mind that what someone said about not trusting the 'five tips' is right
 algaavvaadiyon ne maahaul hi aisa bana diya he ki samaj nahin aata ki kis par bharosa karen or kis par nahin
 Got in line for boarding pass
 hamaari baari aayi to usne hamen upar se neeche tak dekha

 airport par kaafii bheed thi
 There was no seating area
 vahaan kii dukaanon kaa jayja liya
 The bats that we bought for 500 were getting here in 2000
 pehali manzil par ek restaurant tha vahaan baithne kii jagah thi
 The runway was visible in front
 aapako hairaani hogi ki is maahaul main bhi yahaan har aadhe ghante par flite utarati-udati rahi
 After getting the boarding pass after a few hours, went inside

 The name of the brand was first heard

 But such people were shopping, who did not think they could buy

 There was also the family who came on the flight while coming with us

 If he used to feel like his own state, then he wanted to talk to them but he did not

 Within half an hour we were on the plane

 What have we done to Kashmir which is considered to be heaven on earth? The violence that has been going on for 25 years has eclipsed the beauty of Kashmir

 Foreigners have stopped coming here due to terrorism

 We were able to muster the courage to go after thinking for five years ourselves
 yahaan ke naujavaanon ke dimag main nafrat ke zehar ghole ja rahe hai
 The matter has reached here that it is being said that the land in Kashmir belongs to India but the hearts are not ruled
 (haalanki kai logon kaa to ye bhi maananaa he ki algaavvaadi bharat se alag hona chaahate hi nahin
 They have been trying to take maximum benefit from the Indian government under the cover of separatism
 unhen pataa he ki pakistan main milane yaa bharat se alag hone se faaydaa kuch nahin
 ) sawaal he ki kashmir main dilon ko jeetne ke liye kya kiya jaae
 This may sound childish, but if i had listened to me, i would have advised Prime Minister Narendra Modi to use "khan-power" to win the hearts of Kashmiris
 kyonki sangeenon se dil nahin jite ja sakate
 The three Khans - Salman, Shahrukh and Aamir - are very popular among the youth here

 On the way John packed some cookies from the bakery
 aabid kii beti ke liye kuch chocolate liye
 You have to arrive at Srinagar Airport at least 3 hours in advance
 kyonki yahaan aapako suraksha jaanch ke kai charnon se guzarana padataa he
 The first investigation takes place about half a kilometer in advance
 saamaan ke saath utarana hota he
 After X-ray and examination, one has to go ahead by sitting on the car
 is bich gaadi kii bhi jaanch kii jaati he
 The airport then has its own screening process
 akhir main aapako apane bagez kii bhi pahchaan karaani padati he
 We were at the airport portico undergoing all the security cycles
 aabid ne hamen 12 baje hi airport par laa pataka
 Our flight was about four and a half hours later
 gussa to aayaa lekin kiya kya ja saktaa tha
 Especially because of not being able to go to the carpet factory
 man main sawaal aayaa ki kisi ne 'paanch nukte waalon' par bharosa nahin karne kii jo baat kahi he kya wo sahi he
 The separatists have created such an atmosphere that they do not understand who to trust and whom not
 boarding paas ke liye line main lag gaye
 When our turn came, he looked at us from top to bottom
 "aapaki flite kitne baje kii he?" "why
 
 It was half past four
 " "your boarding pass will be made at 2 o'clock
 " When he got off the line, one of the airlines caught him
 "kya aap proyrity bagez chahenge
 " "isse kya hoga?' “your baggage will arrive first when you reach Delhi
 " "so what will it do?" "1000 rupee dena hoga
 " "hamen koi jaldi nahin he
 We don't want " bajet airlines waalon ko kisi tarah bas aapse paisa nikalvaanaa hota he
 The airport was very crowded
 baithne kii jagah nahi thi
 He took stock of the shops there
 jo bat hamane 500 main kharide the, yahaan 2000 main mil rahe the
 There was a restaurant on the first floor and there was a seating area
 saamne ranve nazar aa rahaa tha
 You will be surprised that even in this environment, the flight kept flying every half hour here
 kuch ghante ke baad boarding paas mila to andar gaye
 We still had about two and a half hours
 kaafii chahal-pahal thi
 There was a shop of shoes and bags where we sat
 brand kaa naam pehali baar suna tha
 The goods were quite expensive
 lekin aise log khariddaari kar rahe the, jinako dekhakar nahin lagata tha ki ve kharid bhi sakate hai
 The sale was going on fast
 wo parivaar bhi nazar aayaa jo hamaare saath aate samay flite par aayaa tha
 It seemed as if he had come from Bihar
 muslim jaan padate the
 Parents, spouses and 2 children
 apane pradesh ke jaan padate the to unase baat karne kaa man to kiya lekin kii nahin
 Thankfully the flight arrived on time
 aadhe ghante ke andar ham plane main the
 Even the bus cannot be cleaned so soon
 zehan main khubasurat tasveeron or man main yaadgaar pal ko samete dilli laut rahe the
 Many things were swirling in the mind like clouds which were seen through the window of the plane
 dharti ke swarg maane jane vaale kashmir ke saath hamane kya kiya he? 25 saal se chali aa rahi hinsa ne kashmir kii khubsuurati par grahan laga diya he
 Would he have been able to say even today if he was firdous? "gar firdaus var-rue jami ast Hami Asto, Hami Asto, Hami Asto
 " It means- "if there is heaven on earth, then it is right here
" yaheen he yaheen he
 "today, perhaps Firdaus would also cry on the condition of Kashmir
 aatankwaad ke kaaran videshiyon ne to yahaan aana band hi kar diya he
 People of the country also do not want to come here after seeing the news of violence and bandh
 ham khud paanch saal tak sochate-sochate ab jane kii himmat juta paae
 Poisons of hate are being expressed in the minds of the youth here
 baat yahaan tak pahunch gai he ki kaha jane laga he ki kashmir main zamin bharat kii he lekin dilon par raaj nahin he
 (although many people also believe that separatists do not want to break away from India
 ve to algaavvaad kii aad main bharat sarkaar se zyaada se zyaada faaydaa uthaane kii koshish karte rahe hai
 They know that nothing is better than meeting in Pakistan or separating from India
 ) The question is what to do to win hearts in Kashmir
 baat bachakaani lag sakati he lekin agar meri baat sunate to main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko salaah detaa ki kashmiriyon kaa dil jeetne ke liye "khan-power" kaa istemaal karen
 Because hearts cannot be won by bayonets
 yahaan ke naujavaanon ke bich bahut hi zyaada lokapriy hai teenon khan- salmaan, shahrukh or aamir
 Salman should be punished by the community service especially in the 'hit and Run' case
 unhen kashmir aakar yahaan ke gumraah hue naujavaanon ko mukhyadhara main laane kaa jimmaa saunpa janaa chahie
 They stay here for at least 5 years
 28 saal kii hollywood actress lindse lohan ne 2012 main apni porsh se takkar maari thi to adaalat ne unhen 240 ghante community sarvice tay kii thi
 You might not believe it, but the separatists are very nervous about Bollywood
 1989 main jab algaavvaadi andolan khadaa ho rahaa tha tab sabase pehle unhone yahaan ke cinema haul ko band karana shuru kiya
 It was said that watching cinema is against Islam
 90 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main laal chowk ke paas paladium cinema ko jala diya gaya
 Apart from the Palladium in Srinagar, Naz, Shah, Khayyam, Shiraz and Firdaus theaters closed
 broadway, neelam, reagal ne 1999 tak bahaduree dikhaai
 But after the grenade was thrown at Regal, everyone stopped one by one
 neelam 2010 main band hua, jab dar se darshakon ne aana bilkul band kar diya
 Recently, Salman Khan, who went to Kashmir to shoot the film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', said that if the cinema hall should open here, the separatists did not like it
 mahila algaavvaadi gut 'dukhataran-e-milat' kii cheef asia andrabi kii to maano tanabadan main aag lag gai
 Describing Salman as the agent of India, he said that he is trying for 'cultural advancement'
 kashmir main saanskrithik atikaraman se dilon ko jeetne main harj kya he?tippaniyan The touchiness of the thoughts dissolved with the shock of touch down of the plane
 dilli airport se baahar nikalate hi garmi, umas or dhul bhari aandhi se phir saamana hua
 The chain of sneeze could be stopped the next day with medicines
 apni lambii or shaayad ubaau diary ko khatm karte hue yahi kahana chaahunga ki ek baar aap bhi ho aaie kashmir

 The airport was very crowded
 baithne kii jagah nahi thi
 He took stock of the shops there
 jo bat hamane 500 main kharide the, yahaan 2000 main mil rahe the
 There was a restaurant on the first floor and there was a seating area
 saamne ranve nazar aa rahaa tha
 You will be surprised that even in this environment, the flight kept flying every half hour here
 kuch ghante ke baad boarding paas mila to andar gaye
 We still had about two and a half hours
 kaafii chahal-pahal thi
 There was a shop of shoes and bags where we sat
 brand kaa naam pehali baar suna tha
 The goods were quite expensive
 lekin aise log khariddaari kar rahe the, jinako dekhakar nahin lagata tha ki ve kharid bhi sakate hai
 The sale was going on fast
 wo parivaar bhi nazar aayaa jo hamaare saath aate samay flite par aayaa tha
 It seemed as if he had come from Bihar
 muslim jaan padate the
 Parents, spouses and 2 children
 apane pradesh ke jaan padate the to unase baat karne kaa man to kiya lekin kii nahin
 Thankfully the flight arrived on time
 aadhe ghante ke andar ham plane main the
 Even the bus cannot be cleaned so soon
 zehan main khubasurat tasveeron or man main yaadgaar pal ko samete dilli laut rahe the
 Many things were swirling in the mind like clouds which were seen through the window of the plane
 dharti ke swarg maane jane vaale kashmir ke saath hamane kya kiya he? 25 saal se chali aa rahi hinsa ne kashmir kii khubsuurati par grahan laga diya he
 Would he have been able to say even today if he was firdous? "gar firdaus var-rue jami ast Hami Asto, Hami Asto, Hami Asto
 " It means- "if there is heaven on earth, then it is right here
" yaheen he yaheen he
 "today, perhaps Firdaus would also cry on the condition of Kashmir

 airport par kaafii bheed thi
 There was no seating area
 vahaan kii dukaanon kaa jayja liya
 The bats that we bought for 500 were getting here in 2000
 pehali manzil par ek restaurant tha vahaan baithne kii jagah thi
 The runway was visible in front
 aapako hairaani hogi ki is maahaul main bhi yahaan har aadhe ghante par flite utarati-udati rahi
 After getting the boarding pass after a few hours, went inside
 ab bhi hamaare paas kareeb dhai ghante the
 It was quite an initiative
 ham jahaan baithe vahaan juute or bag kii ek dukaan thi
 The name of the brand was first heard
 saamaan kaafii mahange the
 But such people were shopping, who did not think they could buy
 dhadadhad bikri ho rahi thi
 There was also the family who came on the flight while coming with us
 bol-chaal se lag rahaa tha ki wo bihar se aae hai
 Muslims used to look
 mata-pita, pati-patni or 2 bachche
 If he used to feel like his own state, then he wanted to talk to them but he did not
 shukr tha ki flite vakt par aa gai
 Within half an hour we were on the plane
 itani jaldi to bas kii bhi safaai nahin ho paati
 Returning to Delhi with beautiful pictures and a memorable moment in mind at Zehan
 kai baaten dimag main un badalon ko tarah umad-ghumad rahi thim jo plane kii khidki se nazar aa rahe the
 What have we done to Kashmir which is considered to be heaven on earth? The violence that has been going on for 25 years has eclipsed the beauty of Kashmir
 kya aaj firdaush hote to bhi kya ve kah pate- "gar firdaus var-rue frozen hami asto, hami asto, hami asto
 " iskaa matlab he- "agar dharti par kahin swarg he to wo yaheen he
 This is right here " aaj shaayad firdaus ko bhi kashmir kii haalat par ronaa aa aata
 Foreigners have stopped coming here due to terrorism
 desh ke log bhi aae din hinsa or band kii khabaren sun-pard-dekhakar yahaan aana nahin chaahate
 We were able to muster the courage to go after thinking for five years ourselves
 yahaan ke naujavaanon ke dimag main nafrat ke zehar ghole ja rahe hai
 The matter has reached here that it is being said that the land in Kashmir belongs to India but the hearts are not ruled
 (haalanki kai logon kaa to ye bhi maananaa he ki algaavvaadi bharat se alag hona chaahate hi nahin
 They have been trying to take maximum benefit from the Indian government under the cover of separatism
 unhen pataa he ki pakistan main milane yaa bharat se alag hone se faaydaa kuch nahin
 ) sawaal he ki kashmir main dilon ko jeetne ke liye kya kiya jaae
 This may sound childish, but if i had listened to me, i would have advised Prime Minister Narendra Modi to use "khan-power" to win the hearts of Kashmiris

 The second day of Sahitya Aaj Tak started with Chhath song, the biggest Mahakumbh of many Bhojpuri songs sung by the BJP leader Manoj Tiwari from the stage 'sahitya Aaj Tak 2019' has started on Friday (november 1)
 kaarykram kaa aaj doosraa din he
 On the 'halla Bol' stage of 'sahitya Aaj Tak' on the second day, 'sudhish Pachauri (writer), Sachchidanand Joshi (member secretary, Indira Gandhi National Center for the Arts) and Anant Vijay (writer, critic) gave their opinion in the' literature of ideology 'session
 
 is seshan kaa sanchaalan ajtak ke agjicutive editor rohit sardana ne kiya
 During this discussion, all the three guests kept their words calmly
 charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue rohit ne kaha vichaardhaara sahitya ko banaati he yaa sahitya vichaardhaara ko banaati he
 Both strengthen or weaken each other, who casts a shadow on both of them, and which of the two leads or pulls them forward, all these questions will be discussed
 sudhish pachori ne charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue kaha ki yah kuch nayaa vichaar he, shaayad 18veen shatabdi main vichaardhaara kaa aatank thodaa shuru hua
 Earlier in the Indian tradition, literature and ideology were not directly related, nor was there any connection with the state
 kavi kavita karata tha or kavi kii mahatta itani badi thi ki raja bhi usko namaskara karata tha
 It is much later, especially after the French Revolution, that idiology began to be taken as a world view
 jab capitalism kaa ubhaar hua or uske baad main marxvad aayaa to yah chijen bilkul saaf ho gayi ki vichaardhaara ke bina kaam nahin chalane vaala
 After the Second World War, capitalism changed its nature and instead of industrial revolution, it moved to the service sector, since then the erosion of ideology started
 yadhyapi us dauraan samaajwaad tha, poonjeevaad tha lekin uski jo takat thi vah kam ho gai
 The first book End of Ideology was written by Daniel Benn in 1960
 jisamen unhone kaha ki idology ab kargar nahin he
 But ever since literature was also seen from Marxist perspective
 lenin ke jamaane main mana jaataa tha ki sahitya kranti kaa kalpurja he, uske bina kranti puri nahin ho sakati
 That's why propaganda literature started coming and propaganda literature started coming in and it became useless
 ab ham agar dhyaan se dekhen to bharat main jo pragatisheel andolan aayaa usamen do tarah ke varg ho gaye
 One who was the creator, like Premchand, Premchand may consider progress from ideas but in many cases he does not appear as progressive as the offerings seem to be, especially in the context of female liberation
 lekin jahaan tak garibon kii baat he, vikaas kii baat he vahaan premchand ek agenda puraa kaa puraa dete hai lekin vah rachanaaon ke jariye nikalataa he
 He does not leave through thought
 jaise aaj kii baat aa gai aaj vichaardhaara apni jagah padi rahati he sahityakar apana kaam karata rahata he
 And now it has come to the point that no matter how much the writer lays down ideology, what is the composition and what is the meaning of the composition, whether it gets stuck in the ideology or not, no good work is stuck in any one ideology
 haalanki bahut se log abhi bhi khunte se atake hue hai
 To say that ideology and literature is not synonymous with each other
 sahitya ajtak kii puri kawarej dekhne ke liye yahaan clic karen
 
 
 Anant Vijay said- Peg is a very small word, in fact, the pillar of Marxism is buried
 us khambhe ko aise logon ne pakad rakhaa he jinako lagata he ki khambhe se dur jate hi sab khatm ho jayega
 People of Marxism are those who have something else in their creations, they say something else and do something else
 ye prati tark diya ja saktaa he ki vyakti kisi vichaardhaara ko ho saktaa he usase uski rachana kaa kya, jaise vah charitraheen ho saktaa he lekin apni rachanaaon main bahut hi uttam charitra vaale nayak kaa chithran karata he
 But when you say such things, you do not get recognition in the society
 jo jhuthe bhram failaakar aap manyata lete bhi ho wo bahut der tak tikta nahin he
 Actually, the problem of ideology happened, when we talk about ideology in Indian context, i speak a little openly, so i also face a lot of attacks, Marxists have ruined literature in this country
 naa sirf sahitya balki saamaajik, aarthik main jo moulik lekhan hota tha usko band kar diya
 The books of Pragati Prakashan started selling here
 itani bikne lageen ki bhartiya vaichariki ko baadhit kar diya unhone
 This was followed by a joint effort of the Government of India and the Government of Russia
 iske to ab pramaan bhi milane lage hai
 If you see all the documents, there is many evidence that they made a very concerted effort to spread Marxism here and take Marxism down to the bottom
 us prayaas kaa pratifal yah tha ki bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon main khaas kar hindi vibhaag main jo litarechar se jude hai unamem aap jaakar dekh lijie unamem bas logon ne vampanth kaa billaa nahin lagaaya hua he
 Anant Vijay, telling an anecdote, further said that Pachauri ji made Narendra Kohli ji a member of the People's Writers Association and appointed him the convenor of somewhere
 ab kahaan kohli ji or kahaan janawaad lekin kohli ji se jab inhone kaha to unhone tark diya ki ram se bada janavaadee koun tha ye bataa do wo to jangal main 14 saal rahe
 Stayed among tribals
 uske baad in par dabaav aae inke tamaam mitron ne in par dabaav daalaa ki kohli ji ko hataa do
 What happened was that a writer like Kohli ji had to leave Pachauri ji out of the People's Writers Association
 sthiti yah he ki ek lekhak ko isliye nikaala gaya kyonki vah marks kii jagah ram kii baat karata he, vah bhartiyata kii maala japta he, vah rus kii taraf nahin dekhtaa he
 In his creations the soil of reality does not break that much
 ye jo asprishyata kaa bhav failaayaa marxvaadiyon ne usne bhartiya sahitya kaa bahut nuksaan kiya
 Especially in Hindi, if they used to walk on ideology, it was fine, but i say this again and again that it was the biggest mistake of the Marxists to make the ideology stream and persecute all the other writers in the stream and The situation today is that all the Marxists are now engaged in child labor
 gopal kanda kii tarah hi tamaam marxvaadi lekhak bal swayamsevak or shishu swayamsevak banane main lage hai
 This is a deviation of ideology
 aap isse samaj sakate hai ki yah vichaardhaara swaarth par aadhaarit he or iskaa vichaaron se koi lenaa-dena nahin he

 sachchidanand joshi ne apni baat rakhte hue kaha ki sahitya main aatankwaad to vichaardhaara ke hi str par jabardast rahaa he
 Has been and still has been before
 koun kya likhegaa, koun use padhegaa, koun uski aalochana karegaa, koun use kis puraskaar ke liye anushansit karegaa yah sabakuch vichaardhaara par hi aadhaarit hota rahaa he or isliye isane itnaa aatank machaaya hua he isliye ek daur rahaa he ki ek samay main saare lekhar ek vichaardhaara ke hi rahenge, ab aaj agar raaj badal gaya he to duusare vichaardhaara ke lekhakon ko thodaa sa mauka mil gaya he to dusron ke pet main dard hota he ki saab ab inhen ko bulaayaa ja rahaa he dusron ko nahin bulaayaa ja rahaa he
 For the last 50 years, you kept on beating the chest of others, then you did not think that there are other people somewhere, others will also be writing the same level
 vishvavidhyalayon main niyukti se lekar sab jagah vichaardhaara kaa hi aatank rahaa
 There was a lot of panic especially in the subjects related to literature
 pichley 5 saalon main yadi koi doosraa aage bad gaya, puruskrit ho gaya to vah bhi bardaasht nahin ho rahaa he is had tak aatankwaad pahunch gaya
 As long as this ideology was under ideology, it was fine when it became a case and it is very dangerous to become a case
 vaad bananaa sari cheez ko duusari ore le jaataa he
 Hindupan is very good, made Hindus, made Hindutva, became very dangerous
 isamen jo fark he use samajhane kii koshish kiijie
 The efforts that have been made and are being done continuously to eradicate this difference and that is why we have eliminated the gray area due to terror from this society, it should either be completely black or it should be completely white
 agar aap baayen nahin hai to aap daaen hai bich main aap nahin rah sakate

 Sudhish Pachauri further said that after World War there were only two cases, capitalism and socialism
 ek kahata tha sabko swatantraaa chahie ek kahata tha nahin sabko roti chahie
 Since socialism came to an end, a new thing has come, Fundamentalism, that is, elementalism, be it Sikh elementalism, be it Hindu elementalism, it should be Christian elementalism
 jo kitaaben sabase zyada bain kii gayi wo aisi thim jo kisi ko dharmik str par chot karti hon
 If we look carefully at the psychology of today, our evaluation system goes on working in what we experience
 lekin aaj ek nai cheez paidaa ho gai he jiske bare main main dhyaan dilaanaa chahunga ki vaad jaisi cheez sirf suvidha he kisi bhi shabd ke aage laga dene se ban jaataa he lekin uskaa phayda he ki ham kisi bhi cheez ko ek hi jagah chaan sakate hai
 Particularly what is happening in Hindi is that opportunism is also being hidden in Marxism
 yadi main kahin apni jati laga de rahaa hum, dharm laga de rahaa hum yaa phir apni bhashaa likh de rahaa hum, apane gautra ko laga de rahaa hum or bich main marxvad laga de rahaa hum
 Marxism is still among the best-selling books
 usko sabase zyada padhane vaale log kahin hai to pashchim main hai
 Today we have a new ideology, nationalism
 agar main sawaal karun to deshadrohi, raashtra drohi, yah kya baat hui
 If someone has made a cortun, it has been inside, someone has written something, then it has been done, and there are some people who abuse all but still remain safe
 meraa kahana he ki state kii hameshaa ek vichaardhaara hoti he
 The state will have a program, the state will have a direction
 jaise aaj kaha jaataa he ki sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas, yah ek vichaardhaara he
 Whatever you do, there is an idea embedded in it
 ek raashtra ek desh ek sarkaar ek dal ek kanoon ye kya he, ye ek vichaardhaara he
 If we say in simple language it is the ideology of nationalism
 anant vijay ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki marxvaadiyon ne anya lekhakon ko chhapane se to roka hi iske saath-saath unhone sirf vaicharik aatankwaad hi nahin failaayaa balki tamaam saahitiyik bhrashtachar bhi kiye
 The progressive word, scam is there
 bina puunji ke aap marxvaadi lekhak nahin ho sakate
 The addition of Daru and Murga makes a Marxist writer
 paramparawaadi matlab dakiyanoosee ho gaya he
 Those who are traditionalists are actually progressive, while those who call themselves progressive are traditionalists, they do not want to change, they do not want to be separated from the pegs
 wo log tamatum ke ghode kii tarah sidhe hi dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Ideology is not bad
 vichaardhaara vaale log bhrasht hote hai
 Sachchidanand Joshi also added that he said that what emerged from within you is literature, if you add your ideology to it, it will be tailed
 seshan ke ant main prabhaat prakaashan se chhapi sachchidanand joshi kii pustak 'pal bhar kii pahchaan' kaa locarpan bhi kiya gaya
