 vipaksh sonia gandhi ke netritv main do maah pehle se fielding kar rahaa tha lekin ain maukey par bikharane gaya
 Nitish's move is being seen as jdu's inclination towards BJP in both Bihar and national politics

 11 years ago he added a new category for Dalits

 In such a situation, keeping an eye on the vote bank, he has decided separately from his alliance partner

 However, when the presidential election was started, Nitish took the initiative to field Sonia Gandhi as the opposition candidate
 is dauraan lalu bhi unke saath the
 Shocking the Grand Alliance, Nitish praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November for calling demonetisation a better move

 However, in the Modi wave, he could get only two seats in the 40-member Bihar Lok Sabha

 Leading party leader Sharad Yadav said, "our grand alliance will not be affected
 " unhone mahagathbandhan ke myne babaate hue kaha ki yah aisa gut he jo pradhanmantri modi ke khilaaf he
 As far as the presidential election is concerned, it is a completely different matter

 Although officially he refused to say anything
 lalu guuruuvaar ko yojit hone vaali vipaksh kii baithak main shaamil honge
 On the other hand, Nitish will need the support of 122 mlas to stay in power in Bihar

 The Income Tax Investigation Team of Mumbai has exposed such a network of sharebrokers spread across the country, who used to clear black money with the loss and profit of their customers by doing fake trade
 tex vibhaag ne deshbhar main brokers ke kai thikaanon par chaape markar kareeb 6,000 karod rupee kii farji trading ko pakadaa he
 Tax officer said, "it is just the beginning, we are going to reach big fish soon
" share bazaar ko paardarshee banane ke liye jaruri he ki aise logon ko isse baahar kiya jaae
 The tax official told India Today on the condition of anonymity that apart from companies dominated by bullion business, it also has several big brokerage houses
 is oparation ke baad hamen kai bade suraag mili hai
 In delhi-ncr, the raid of the Department of Tax, raided a total of 39 locations of Brokers and Trading Members in cities like Delhi, Noida, Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Mumbai, Kanpur, Kolkata
 chhapemari kii karrwai mangalvaar subah se shuru hokar shanivaar ko khatm hui
 a senior finance ministry official says that these brokers help tax evaders
 '' brokers khud or duusare anya brokers ke saath sajeesh karke khud hi sauda kaat lete the
 Everything was predetermined which client's trade was to show a loss, who would benefit
 zyaadaatar ye jaalsaji kaa trade vaayada kaarobaar ke tahat iliquid opsans main ho rahaa tha
 "monitoring Trading" monitored the trading of these brokers for six months prior to the raid
 uske baad sandehaaspad trading se jude aankadon ko lekar mumbai tex investigeshan team ke netritv main kareeb 90 tex adhikariyon ne puure desh main aise brokers ke thikaanon par dhaava bol diya
 The tax official said that about 80 per cent of the brokers who were raided here, in their initial statements, admitted that they were doing the wrong thing for the client
 share bazaar ke regulator sebi ne bhi samay-samay par vaadi karobaar se jude synchronised trading ke jariye galat kaam karne waalon par sawaal uthaaya he
 How does the derivatives market work? Common people understand that by paying money, shares are bought and the sellers get money
 lekin bada kaarobaar isse alag hota he, jise vaayada kaarobaar yaa derevative kehete hai
 There is no delivery of shares in this
 yahaan share kaa daam kahaan tak pahonchega is sapane kaa kaarobaar hota he
 This is called 'underling asset value' in English
 share kharidne-bechney ke liye contractokhareedne or bechney vaale main ek samjhauta hota he ki ek tay samay seemaa or keemat par duusari party in share ko kharidegi
 This is called future derivatives
 maan lijie ramesh or suresh ek future contract karte hai
 The condition of the contract is that Ramesh will buy 100 shares of XYZ Bank at the rate of Rs 500 per share within the next two months
 is bich share kii keemat 450 rupee par aa jaati he
 In such a situation, Ramesh incurred a notional loss of Rs 50 from the fixed price on the contract
 ab ramesh ke paas do vikalp (opshan) hai
 Either he settles the contract before the expiry date of two months and pays Suresh Rs 50 per share
 doosraa opshan ye he ki ramesh expyri taarikh (do maheenaa) tak intjaar kare
 Second- Suppose the price of XYZ comes to Rs
 475 on the day of expiry, ie Rs
 15 less than the price at the time of the contract
 aise main contract ke expire ke samay ramesh ko (15 rupee x 100 share) ke hisaab se suresh ko 1500 rupee dena hoga
 Note that there is no transaction of physical shares here
 is future contract main ramesh ye kah kar kanni nahin kaat saktaa he ki share kii keemat uske ummid ke mutabik nahin he
 These are also options, but the stock market has found two more options for people like Ramesh, which is called option derivatives
 isamen aapke paas opshans hota he ki aap contract kii sharton ko puri tarah nahin maane
 Just give a little money to Suresh at the time of the contract for not accepting this
 ise ghoose nahin, share bazaar ise ‘premium’ kehete hai
 These options are also of two types, if you choose to buy, then it will be called 'call option' and if you choose to sell, then 'put option'
 is premium ko dekar ramesh XYZ ke share kii keemat main hone vaale ghate ke jokhim ko kam kar saktaa he or agar do maheene main (expyri tak ) share kii keemat 500 se upar ho jaati he to puraa phayda ramesh ko milegaa kyonki tay shart ke mutabik use keval har share ke liye 500 rupee chukaane hai
 You will be surprised to know that derivatives account for a large share of the total turnover of the stock market including India
 udhaaharan ke liye hamane neshnal stock exange or bambe stock exange ko pichley paanch dinon ke market turnover ko dekha
 Over 97% of the trading derivatives ie Future & Options, also known as F&O in the market
 derevevative yaa vaayada kaarobaar aaj kii taarikh main har bazaar main hota he chaahe wo share bazaar ho yaa phir karency ho yaa camodity
 After all, how did stock brokers benefit? The tax department observed that some brokers are executing the deal by becoming two parties themselves or brokers like themselves
 ye saude un sheyaron ho rahe he jo iliquid he yani jahaan saude bahut kam ho rahe the
 For example, Ramesh's client is z who has incurred losses in the current year and wants his black money to turn white through this market
 duusari ore y he, jinhen bijness gen yani munafa hua he or wo chaahate hai ki unhe los yani nuksaan ho jaae taaki phaayde ko edjust kiya ja sake
 Do not have to pay tax altogether
 teesraa aisa client he jinhone baari bharkam bank lone liya he lekin unka bijness thik nahin chal rahaa he
 They fear that the bank may withdraw the loan or raise the charge
 unhen farji munafa chahie
 These brokers were meeting these three requirements from the derivatives market by taking commission
 
 
 
 Suppose z and y are clients of one such broker, one of whom (Z) has to show the loss and the other (Y) is the profit
 brokar ne ek aise share ko chunaa jahaan bahut zyada trade nahin ho rahaa he or khud hi bair or celler banakar trade ko anjaam de gaya
 Reverse buy and sell means the need of both clients y and z through inverted trade
 yahi kaam do se adhik brokar ne milakar bhi kiya he
 The tax department found that some brokers across the country are offering such a facility to their clients

 The CBDT said after the raid that "some companies which have made profits and losses have used this wrong method
 ek anumaan ke mutabik iske jariye kareeb 3500 karod ko edjust kiya gaya he
 Recent searches and surveys have also revealed those showing wrongly long-term or long-term gains, which have rigged profits of about Rs 2000 crore through three penny stocks ”

 No clear majority to any party
 
 
 pidipi or bijepi ne pichley chunaav ke mukaable behatar pradarshan kiya he
 While PDP became the party to win the most seats, BJP got the most votes
 
 
 lekin donon kaa pradarshan itnaa acha bhi nahin rahaa ki apane dam par sarkaar bana saken
 The BJP has got 25 seats and needs 19 more seats to form the government
 24 disambar ko dilli main hui parliamentry board kii baithak main bijepi ne daawa kiya kii use 31 vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil he, parantu sarkaar banane ke liye ab bhi 13 vidhayak kam hai, jiske liye use pidipi yaa neshnal conference main se kisi ek kaa samarthan lenaa zaruri ho jaataa he
 Now if the BJP gets support from the PDP then the number rises to 59, which is an excessively large number to form the government, but the support of PDP will not benefit the BJP
 pidipi apane paas chah saal tak siem kaa pad rakhana chaahati he, jabaki bijepi chaahati he ki agar chah nahin to kam se kam teen saal ke liye to uskaa mukhyamantri bane, jo hindu ho
 The PDP has got the maximum seats from Kashmir, where 97 per cent of Muslims live
 pidipi yah bhaleebhanti jaanati he ki kashmir main bijepi-virdohi lahar he, isliye usne bijepi ke aage aisi shart rakhi he
 If the BJP has to become its Chief Minister, then the most ideal party for it would be the National Conference of Omar Abdullah, who has 15 mlas, and because of this, Omar Abdullah is not in a position to negotiate yet, but yes, if the BJP government If the National Conference supports, it can definitely benefit
 jammu kashmir kii vidhansabha ke saath-saath use centre ke mantrimandal main bhi jagah mil sakati he
 By the way, Omar Abdullah had gone on the backfoot before the election, and even though he is denying any deal with BJP, he knows that to remain in state politics and regain public confidence It is very important for it to remain in power
 udhar, jaise haryana main sarkaar banane ke baad bijepi ne mukhyamantri pad ke liye kisi jat netaa ko chunane kii bajaay manohar laal khatter ko chunaa, jo punjabi hai
 After 18 years, a non-jat Chief Minister has been formed in Haryana and for the first time in Haryana, the BJP government has been formed
 is bich, ab jharkhand ke liye bhi bijepi ne rajya ke pehle gaiyr-adivasee mukhyamantri ke rup main raghubar das ke naam par muhar lagaai he
 So, under the same policy of BJP, it seems that in Jammu and Kashmir also BJP would like to make a Hindu the Chief Minister
 vaise, ek baat or he
 
 
 If the BJP had got some seats in Kashmir too, it would have been the desire of the BJP or not, it would have to think of the name of a Muslim leader to maintain the balance in both the regions - Jammu and Kashmir, but now when the party has given all the seats only If they win from Jammu, then the BJP will not want to get angry with the voters of Jammu by agreeing on a Muslim name
 bijepi main mukhyamantri pad kii res main dow jitendra singh kaa naam sabase aage chal rahaa he, vaise ek anya netaa dow nirmal singh bhi res main shaamil hai
 Dr
 Jitendra Singh is a BJP MP from Udhampur and a Minister of State in PMO
 58-varshiya jitendra ko modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 He defeated Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in the Lok Sabha elections
 sutron kii maane to zyaadaatar vidhayak bhi jitendra singh ko hi mukhyamantri dekhnaa chaahate hai
 If his name is agreed upon and a BJP government is formed, he will be the next CM of Jammu and Kashmir
 yah vahi jitendra singh hai, jinhone modi sarkaar banane ke duusare din hi anuchhed 370 par bayaan dekar ghati kii raajnneeti main halchal paidaa kar di thi, haalanki baad main vah apane bayaan se palat gaye the
 Meanwhile, Dr
 Nirmal Singh is elected from Billawar assembly constituency
 vah party pradeshdhyaksh bhi rah chuke hai, or ullekhneey he ki billaavar seat bijepi ne 37 saal baad jiti he, lekin pench yah he ki unke naam par sabhi vidhayak sahamat nahin hai
 According to sources, at least six BJP mlas are against making Nirmal Singh the leader of the legislative party
 ab party vidhayakon ne is baat kaa faisla rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah par chhod diya he ki vah kise vidhayak dal kaa netaa chunate hai
 If you look at the history, the first 'prime Minister' of Jammu and Kashmir was Meherchand Mahajan, who was a Hindu
 agar aane vaale dinon main bijepi apni ranneeti main kaamyaab ho jaati he to ve din dur nahin, jab ghati ko pehla hindu mukhyamantri bhi dekhne ko milegaa
 BJP will definitely want to make history in the valley and give a historic gift of New Year to Prime Minister Modi

 Virat Kohli, who made his Test captaincy debut for the first match of the Border Gavaskar Trophy, has achieved another feat
 australia ke khilaaf duusari pari main 30 ranon par pahunchate hi kohli ne test cricket main 2000 ran puure kar liye
 Kohli is the 32nd Test batsman of India to reach this milestone
 kohli ne apane kariyar ke 30wein match main lagbhag 42 ke ausat se do hajaar ranon kaa aankada paar kiya
 Kohli had 1855 runs in his account before the Adelaide Test
 kohli ne edilade main pehali pari main 115 ran banaae or phir duusari pari main 30 ranon par pahunchane ke saath hi 2000 ran puure kiye
 In his career so far, Kohli has scored 6 centuries and 10 half-century
 bharat ke liye sabase adhik test ran sachin tendulkar (15921) ne banaae hai
 It is also a world record
 - input IANS Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has broken the 37-year-old record of legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev
 pune main australia ke khilaaf khele ja rahe pehle test ke duusare din mehmaan team kii pehali pari kaa antim wicket chatakaate hue aswin ne is gharelu sijan main 64 wicket puure kiye, jiske saath hi unhone kapil dev ke home sijan main sabase adhik 63 viketon ke record ko peeche chhod diya
 Kapil Dev took 63 wickets in 13 matches in 1979-80, while Ashwin managed to break this record in only 10 matches
 aswin, jo haal hi main test cricket main sabase jaldi 250 wicket puure karne vaale gendbaaz bane the, 2012-13 sijan main is record ko todane ke kareeb aae the
 This season, Ashwin showed his talent in world cricket, taking 61 wickets in 10 Tests
 vishwa ke number 1 spinner aswin ne is home sijan main behtareen shuruyaat karte hue newzealand ke khilaaf 3 test kii siries main 27 wicket hasil kiye, iske baad england ke viruddh aswin ne 5 maichon main kul 28 wicket jatke or bangladesh ke khilaaf ekmaatr test main ve 6 wicket hasil karne main kaamyaab rahe
 The 30-year-old spinner now needs just 7 wickets to complete 200 wickets on Indian soil
 aisa karte hi vah anil kumble (350), harbhajan singh (265) or kapil dev (219) ke baad ye uplabdhi hasil karne vaale chauthe bhartiya gendbaaj ban jaaenge
 Team India's off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin became the bowler to take 250 wickets in the lowest matches against Bangladesh in Tests

 Prabhat Ranjan has a tremendous collection of short stories, titled Bolero Class
 isaki kahaniyon-or sheershak ne bhi-un aakankshaon ko kushalta se pakadaa he jo tarah-tarah ke chote shaharon se hokar guzarane vaale nae hive or tolave tak apana rasta bana chuki hai
 There are also several virtual highways beyond the asphalt that are connecting the entire country to each other
 inaki pahunch gharon ke andar tak he
 Inside: drawing room, study and bedroom
 lekin bazaar or gharon tak nai soch (or nae product) pahunchane vaale hive manyata or chalan ke puraane dhaanchon ko puri tarah se khatm nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Technology is changing at a much faster pace than beliefs and where these two meet, aspirations collide and desires do not get any edge
 chaar mahanagaron (nai dilli, mumbai, kolkata or chennai) or 12 chote shaharon (hisar, muradabad, kota, kolhapur, jamnagar, ratlam, selem, kottayam, guntur, asanasol, baleshwar or izol) main kiye gaye 2012 nilsan-india today sex survey main ubharkar aae chote shahar us bindu par pahunch gaye hai jahaan teji se badalata samay, bahut dhire-dhire badal rahi manyataon se takaraa rahaa he
 This tenth annual sex survey by India Today shows that people from other parts of the country see the Northeast like another country
 inter-personal sambandhon ke kuch pahaluon ke maamle main to yah saaf taur par dikhataa he
 Similarly, many people (79 per cent) of Aizawl, capital of Mizoram, consider their sex life as satisfactory
 haalanki, kachche aankadon se hamen yah nahin pataa chal paata ki logon ke liye ‘‘santushti’’ kaa kya matlab he, lekin yah tathy vichaarneey he ki izol-aise kshetra main sthit shahar jahaan kaaphi had tak saamaanya jivan baadhit rahaa he-ke logon main desh ke anya chote shaharon ke mukaable apane din-pratidin ke saamaajik jivan or aarthik haalat ke bare main khushhaali kaa ooncha str dekha gaya
 The persistence unrest in the Northeast has not changed much the tradition of comparative liberal contacts between men and women
 isliye izol main un logon kaa pratishat sabase zyada he jinhone pehle sex partner ke rup main apane bwoyfriend / garlfriend ko namit kiya he
 There is also a relatively high number of people living in live-in relationships and having more than one sex partner
 izol main jahaan bwoyfriend yaa garlfriend ke ke saath date par jane waalon kaa aankada sabase zyada he (89 fisadi), vahiin muradabad or guntur main yah kramash: 3 fisadi or 2 fisadi he
 Aizawl's high figure once again reflects various social and cultural values
 chote shaharon main dating kii kam taadaad se pataa chalata he ki aise sampark saarvajanik gatividhiyon main aate hai or is tarah kii gatividhiyon ke liye jagah bahut kam hai
 This situation will change with the increase of places like malls, multiplexes and public parks, where loving couples will be able to roam without any harassment or fear of being identified
 bwoyfriend, garlfriend rakhane or dating par jane kii aakanksha saaf taur se jaahir kii gai or zyaadaatar shaharon main (muradabad ko chhodkar sabhi main) badi sankhya main logon ne yah sweekaar kiya ki ve vipareet ling ke kisi vyakti ke pyaar main pad chuke hai
 It is not surprising that love and romance are important aspects of cosmopolitan identity, and they are also an important part of the current consumer culture
 ye donon pahalu chahat kii aisi duniya ko poshit karte hai jo nae-nae raaston kii talash karti rahati he
 It is also interesting to note that comparatively more people (50 per cent) in Kota admitted that they had gone on a date
 isaki vajah yah ho sakati he ki koching industry kii vajah se vahaan badi sankhya main yuva rahete hai
 After all, the modern aspirations of world success and intimacy often go hand in hand
 bharat main aadhunik antarangta ke bare main soch main chumban kii ati mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi he
 More than modern, it is considered "too much" in Western and "real" things outside Indian culture
 hamaari filmon ne chumban ko dikhaae bina uske sanket dene ke sabase asaadhaaran tareeke nikaale hai
 This survey provides important evidence of change in attitude of people
 vastav main, chumban kaa anand lene kii baat sweekaar karne ke maamle main chote shaharon kaa pratishat chaaron mahanagaron se bhi zyada he (udhaaharan ke liye kota ke 89 fisadi log yah sweekaar karte hai, jabaki mumbai main 81 fisadi)
 In response to another question, those surveyed attach sufficient importance to kissing as a sentimental feeling (90 per cent in Jamnagar and 78 per cent in Salem)
 chumban ke bare main ravaiya badalanaa asal main logon kii khud ke bare main soch main badlaav kaa hi hissaa he
 This only indicates that thinking about changing attachment is changing, we also find that in another case new feelings of our separate identity are developing
 romance kii ichha modern hone kii kalpana kaa hissaa he or yah apana nirnay khud lene (udhaaharan ke liye partner chunane) or apane mutabik jivan jeene ke vichaaron se judaa he
 What qualities do people look for in their partners? There are many very interesting answers to this question
 sambhavit dating partner ke liye sabase zyada pasand kiye jane vaale gun macurity or khulaapan hai
 "sexual attraction" comes at the bottom
 kya isse yah matlab nikaala jaae ki is asthir samay main-or yadi dating partner hi pati-patni bane-paripakv soch kii jarurat he? or log jab jivan-saathi kii talash karte hai to jajbaat kii jagah tark ke aadhaar par faisla karte hai?shaayad isi vajah se upyukt jivan-saathi kii talash ke liye log atakalbaaji main daanv lagane kii bajaae doston or apane jaise logon par zyada bharosa karte hai
 But it has come to light that "beauty" is seen as different from "sexual attraction"
 badi sankhya main logon ne kaha ki unke partner main sundarataa kaa gun unhen aakarshith karata he
 But beauty is probably in the eye of the beholder
 badlaavon ke pramaan ke alaava yah survey hamen is baat kii yaad bhi dilaataa he ki chote shahar lambey samay se chal rahi manyataon ke agua hai or unamem badlaav nahin aayaa he
 So most of the people surveyed have indicated that they have only one sexual partner and that their spouse is their ideal sexual partner
 badlaav kii raftaar ne vivaahit jivan ke mahatv ke bare main ravaiye ko nahin badla he
 It has also not changed people's thinking about intimacy and many other aspects of the relationship
 isliye badi sankhya main mard or auraten, donon yah ummid karte hai ki uske jivan-saathi kaa comarya surakshit ho
 And even though the attitude towards sex is changing — 56 percent of Guntur people have confessed to sexual fantasy — but most people who took part in the survey said that their virginity was safe at the time of marriage
 ek baar phir se vaastaviktaa utani mahatvapurn nahin he, jitna ki comarya ke bare main soch
 Ratlam has reversed this stance: Only 11 percent believe that their partner's virginity at the time of marriage would have been safe
 kai anya mahatvapurn maamle bhi hai jinamein lambey samay se chal rahi saanskrithik manyataon kii diwaar ko badlaav kii bayaar ke jhonke lage hai
 a small number of people accepted that they could remarry if the sex life was not satisfactory, and many people (84 percent in Moradabad and 73 percent in Baleshwar) rejected live-in relationships
 isi tarah dating to sweekaarya he, lekin shaadi se pehle yon sambandh ko bahut kam sweekaaryata mili he
 But 22 per cent of the quota people accepted the "relationship with consent"
 kota main yah sweekaar karne waalon kaa pratishat bhi zyada rahaa ki yon sambandh banaate samay yon phantasy kii mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he or unhone samaan ling ke vyakti se yon sambandh banaae hai
 Kota, playing the role of a pressure cooker for aspiring competitive exams, has also become a city of experimentation in terms of intimacy
 yon jivan main prayog karne se peeche na hatane ke baavjood-survey main shaamil ratlam ke 22 fisadi logon ne sex toys kaa istemaal kiya he or kottayam ke 59 fisadi logon ne pornographic filmein dekhi hai-yon sambandhon ke aise kam hi tareeke hai jinamein limit se zyada prayog sweekaar kiya jaataa ho
 So the acceptance of homosexuality and bisexuality is also very low, as is the case between opposite sex people and transgender people
 yah asal main hamen vaastavik chalan kii jagah logon kaa ravaiya zyada dikhaata he kyonki anubhavjanya sakshya alag kahani kehete hai
 For example, married men have been found to have bisexual relationships
 yah kai chote shaharon main bhi dikhaai detaa he
 We are in a world where the flight of imagination does not recognize the boundaries of tradition
 bharat ke chote shaharon kaa yon jivan hamen saamaajik or saanskrithik jatiltaaon ke bare main bahut kuch bataata he
 Perhaps the most notable aspect of this is that the people of Hisar, Kolhapur and Kota now seem willing to talk about it

 gurudev rabindranath tagore kii kaaljayi rachana gitanjali kisi parichay kaa mohataaj nahin
 
 
 Not only Bengal, one of the biggest icons of India, Tagore's creations are beyond time
 
 
 jinpar naa to kabhi samay kii gard jami or na hi jinaki praasangikta kam hui
 
 
 The pages of Tagore's personal life have also been known from Bangla Bhadralok to India and abroad
 lekin tagore kii jindagi kaa ek panna jo kabhi duniya ke saamne nahin aayaa, ab wo ek film ke jariye saamne aa rahaa he
 
 
 For the first time, this love story of Tagore will be revealed to the whole world
 
 'thinking of Him' is the name of the film, this story of Argentine Feminist writer Victoria Ocampo and Tagore's close relationship would never have come to light if there was not a long series of letters between them
 is kahani ko parde par utaarne kaa bidaa uthaaya suraj johnson films ne
 The film's producer Suraj Kumar has added the famous Argentine director Pablo Caesar and now the shooting of the film is about to begin
 film argentina france or bharat teen mulkon main shoot kii jaaegi
 The name of the film is 'thinking of Him'
 is film menvictoria or tagore ke khubasurat rishtonko behad khubsuurati ke saath dikhaane kii kavayad kii ja rahi he
 The film will be shot in Bolpur in West Bengal while the rest will be shot in Argentina and France
 yah film victoria ke saath tagore ke bhavuk or antarang rishte ko bayaan karne kii koshish he
 For this, the curtain is set on realizing the 1920s era when this love story of Tagore and Victoria had come
 aise shuru hui tagore or victoria kii lav storicagore apni rachanaaon kii vajah se har daur main praasangik rahe hai
 
 
 So it is to be hoped that when this film comes, its resonance will be heard all over the world
 film ke produsar suraj kumaar ke mutabik is project main argentina sarkaar kaaphi saport kar rahi he
 The film's starcast has almost been finalized
 
 And soon it will be announced
 film ke produsar bataate hai ki victoria kii tagore se is rishte kii shuruyaat 1914 main hui thi
 Then he got to read the French translation of Gitanjali
 gitanjali vahi rachana he jiske kaaran unhen nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 Victoria was 25–26 at the time, while Tagore himself was 63
 
 
 kai bhashaaon kii jaankaar victoria se tagore is kadar prabhavit hue the ki unhone 1925 main apana kavita sangrah poorabi victoria ko samarpit kiya tha
 Victoria met Tagore in November 1924
 tagore peru kii yatra par gaye the usee dauraan wo biimaar pad gaye
 At that time it took at least 6 months to travel, so Tagore stayed in Buenos Aires, Argentina to rest, Tagore's stay there was big news of that period
 charchaa sunakar victoria tagore se milane us hotel pahunchin jahaan wo ruke hue the
 Victoria advises him that the hotel environment is not suitable for his health
 victoria ne khaastaur se tagore ke liye ek ghar kiraaye par liya jahaan tagore kaa do maheene kaa pravaas kaa zyaadaatar hissaa vyateet hua
 Victoria's second meeting with Tagore was in 1930 when an exhibition of Tagore's paintings was held in Paris
 ye aayojan victoria ne hi kiya tha
 This was Tagore and Victoria's last meeting
 haalanki iske baad 1941 yani apane nidhan se pehle tak tagore or victoria ke bich khaton kaa silsilaa chalata rahaa
 According to Suraj Kumar, the producer of Tagorefilm, Victoria used to be called Bijoya, Tagore used to address Victorio in his letters as Bijoya (vijaya)
 tagore ne apane argentina pravaas main kareeb 30 kavitaayen bhi likhin
 There is one more thing to note here
 wo yah he ki latin america mulkon se bharat ke rishte
 This story of Tagore is not just a tale of platonic love but also shows how strong India's relations with Latin American countries were in those times
 jaahir he is film ke jariye in rishton ko taaja or majboot karne kii pahal kii ja rahi he abhi haal main hi tagore kii berth aneverseri manaai gai he or aise maukey par ab tagore ke prem kii amar gaatha bahut jald parde par hogi, isse behatar tohfa tagore ke prashansakon ke liye or kya ho saktaa he
 In the education world of the country, now it is being talked about giving place to new names which were hitherto anonymous or whose discussion is less according to the rest
 angreji akhbaar iconomic times main chhapi ek report ke mutabik ujisi aise hi kuch gumnaam shakhsiyaton ke naam par apane research centaron ke naam rakhane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Let me tell you that till now, only the names of nehru-gandhi family have been seen in the names of many prestigious universities or institutions in the country
 akhbaar ke mutabik ujisi ne jin 50 nae logon ke naam kii list banaai he unamem jansangh netaa dinadayal upaadhyaay, raja ram mohan raay, swami vivekanand, ahilya bai, madan mohan malviya, es radhakrishnan or jakir hossain jaise naam shaamil hai
 It is believed that the new government of the country is no longer in favor of naming an institution after the nehru-gandhi family
 akhbaar ke mutabik ujisi jald hi ek samiti kaa gathan karegi jo ye naam prastaavit karegi or phir naam par faisla hone ke baad unke naam se centre of excilence kaa namakaran kiya jayega
 It is worth mentioning that according to the information revealed under an RTI, till now there are about 99 educational institutions in the country which are named after the nehru-gandhi family
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi apane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan is baat ko tarjeeh di thi or congress kii sarkaar par desh kii kai anya badi shakhsiyaton ke saath bhedbhaav karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 It is often said that girls choose their partners very thoughtfully, but in this case, boys are not far behind girls
 apane liye partner kaa chayan karne se pehle ladke, ladakiyon kii bahut si chizon par dhyaan dete hai
 Let's know which things of girls affect boys the most
 1
 It is generally said that in the first meeting, your smile leaves a mark on the front more than your words
 aap apni muskuraahat se kisi ke bhi dil main jagah bana sakate hai
 Boys are moved by this gentle smile of girls
 2
 Today's modern boys mostly like girls who have self-confidence
 jinhen yah pataa ho ki kis samay kaisaa bartaav karnaa he
 Boys are more attracted towards such women
 3
 Boys may or may not speak to themselves, but in reality they are very impressed with the dressing style of girls
 ladako ko zyaadaatar aisi ladkiya pasand aati hai jo duusari ladakiyon ko copy karne ke bajaae khud kenatural stilmen rahati hai
 Be it makeup, clothes or footwear
 4
 The eyes are called the mirror of a person's personality
 ladako ko aakarshith karne ke liye ladakiyon kii khubasurat ankhen hi kaaphi hoti hai
 Boys mostly like girls with big eyes
 5
 Whatever the boys may be, but they pay attention to the makeup of girls and their perfumes
 ladakon ko ladakiyon keparfum kii khushboobahut prabhavit karti he
 Even if they forget the girl, forget what they said but, they never forget the fragrance of their perfume
 6
 Most boys like sensible and settled girls
 ab yah aap par nirbhar karata he aap kis tarah apni samajhadaari kaa pradarshan kis tarah se karti hai

 input language sulajh gaya team india kaa gambhir sankat
 a crisis that was a headache for captain Dhoni before the match, but now this crisis has been solved, the crisis was about the rotation policy of Team India
 lagaataar do maichon main behtareen pradarshan karne vaale gautam gambhir ko austrailia ke khilaaf baahar baithna tha, dhoni kii chintaa bhi is baat ko lekar thi, ki jo khilaadi farm main hai, use team se baahar kaise baithaaya jaae, lekin sahvaag ke chot kii vajah se naa khilne ke faisle ne ye sankat sulajhaa diya
 Now in Sunday's match, Sehwag will sit out of the team, while Gambhir and Sachin will start the innings
 haalanki shanivaar ko sahvaag ne halki practice jarur kii, lekin unka baahar baithna tay mana ja rahaa he, iske alaava team india ke khilaadiyon ne bhi bristben kii uchhaalbhari pich par jamkar abhyaas kiya
 Dhoni is cheering everywhere, but before the next match of the tri-series, Dhoni's heart and mind were burning, because Dhoni was under heavy tension
 jaanate hai captain kii saradardi kisne badhaai thi? sachin, sahvaag or gambhir ne badhaai thi dhoni kii tension
 Dhoni was in a strange mood to decide which of these three to sit on the bench
 edilade main match ke baad yun to unhone kah diya tha ki gautam ko baitha sakate hai baahar
 And now when the turn came to sit outside, Dhoni got trapped
 pichley do maichon main gambhir ne 92 or 91 ran kaa score khadaa kiya
 Putting Gambhir out could spoil the winning strategy
 sachin ko kaise baithaate baahar?captain sachin ko baahar baithaate bhi to kaise, kya kahkar bench par baithne ke baad sachin sirf ek match khele hai phir duusare match main unke kad ke ballebaaz ko baahar baithaana koi vikalp tha hi nahin
 Veeru's injury ended Veeru's return to the XI as part of the entanglement policy, but Veeru could not recover from his back problem and Dhoni's headache also ended with the news
 yani ab sachin or gambhir hi bhartiya pari kii shuruuaat karte nazar aaenge

 His younger brother Hardik Pandya was playing applause in the dug out off the field
 kuch maheene pehle australian daure par hardik dhooma machaa rahe the or unhen bharat kaa aglaa super star mana jane laga tha
 When IPL started, Hardik Pandya's name was on everyone's tongue and Krunal was identified as Hardik's elder brother
 lekin ek maheene ke bheetar bade bhai ne bataaya ki bada aakhir bada hi hota he
 But the love is still deep in both
 match ke baad krunal ne kaha - hardik ke saath meraa rishta bahut anokhaa he
 i am very sorry when he does well
 main bataa nahin saktaa ki ham kaisaa mahasoos karte hai
 It is impossible for us to live without each other

 But within a month, the elder brother said that the elder is the last
 magar donon main pyaar ab bhi utana hi gaharaa he

 vah jab acha karte hai to mujhe bahut fakr hota he
 i can't tell how we feel

 When Krunal and Hardik were younger, they had a dream of playing cricket on a big level together, like the Pathan brothers of their city Baroda
 pathan bhaaiyon kii tarah hi pandya bhaaiyon kii kahani bhi he
 
 
 Irrfan became a superstar of Indian cricket before Yusuf Pathan was successful, but then Irfan could not maintain his performance like Hardik and Yusuf came and left his mark just like Krunal did

 The district administration has now ordered a massive campaign against adulteration when it comes to the fact that adulteration is included in the food menu served during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Kanpur

 After this, SPG was immediately informed and SPG stopped using both these foods
 is ghatana ke baad ai ai tii prashasan bhi harakat main aayaa or usne maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh de diye he kyonki pradhanmantri ko jo khaanaa parosa janaa tha uskaa rashan iaiti main rashan supplai karne vaale ne diya tha
 IIT Director Prof
 Sanjay Govind Dhande has ordered an inquiry against this ration supplier
 dm meshram ne ek baar phir saaf kiya ki pradhanmantri singh ko jo bhojan parosa gaya usamen kisi bhi prakaar kii koi milawat nahin thi
 DM Meshram said that in the campaign launched by the district administration against adulteration khori from January 2010, about 547 samples of food grains were sent to the lab in Lucknow for testing
 isamen daalen, besan, tel, chaaval, doodh, khoyaa, paneer, icecream se lekar lagbhag sabhi khaadya padaarth shaamil the
 According to the DM, reports of samples of about 91 food items have come to the district administration and adulteration has been confirmed
 ab jila prashasan in sabhi milawat kaa kaarobaar karne waalo ke khilaaf exiaar darj karne kii taiyaari kar rahaa he or is maamle main kisi bhi tarah kii koi riyaayat nahi hogi
 According to district administration sources, the industrial city of Kanpur has become a stronghold of adulterated goods

 In response to the question of why there is no action against those who sell fake and adulterated goods, a top Municipal Corporation official says that Kanpur is becoming the largest center of adulterated food in Uttar Pradesh and adulteration in every item here Is being found nagar nigam ke adhikari kehete hai ki janvari 2010 se abhi tak nagar nigam ne shahar ke vibhinn sthanon par chapa maar kar milavati khoyaa, deshi ghi, masaale, namakeen dalmot, chipatti sahit anek milavati khadya padaathare kii baari baari maatra pakadi
 He said that it is the job of the department to seal fake and adulterated goods and send their samples to the laboratory in Lucknow, when there is a report that it has been adulterated in the samples of the goods, then we take further action
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki jab tak lakhanu sthit lab se report nahin aa jaati ham koi karrwai nahin kar sakate he
 Now when the report has come in some cases, we will take action
 nagar nigam ke adhikari kehete he ki niyamat: lakhanu sthit prayogshaala se milavati namoonon kii report chalis din ke bheetar aa jaani chaiye lekin kabhi kabhi is report ko aane main kai maheene lag jate he jis kaaran milavati vastuon kaa kaarobaar karne waalo ke khilaaf karrwai nahi ho paati
 DM Meshram has also appealed to the people of the city, if they get adulteration in any food item anywhere in the city, they can send a message through SMS on their mobile, action will be taken immediately after raiding that adulterated Khor

 At the behest of the Hydjackers, this time the aircraft was headed for the African country of Uganda
 28 june 1976, dopaher 3
 At 15, Antby Airport, Uganda, the matter now became truly dangerous
 kyonki uganda kii jis sarajameen par vimaan utaara gaya khud vahaan kaa taanashaah idi amin in philistini aatankwaadiyon ke samarthan main khadaa tha
 And before the Israeli militants could muster some support, the Ugandan army surrounded the Antby Airport from all sides
 makasad tha kisi bhi rescue oparation ko shuru hone se pehle hi khatm kar dena
 About 100 Ugandan Army personnel were present at the Antby Airport who had taken the entire airport in their enclosure
 iske baad vimaan se ek-ek kar saare musafiron ko neeche utaara jaataa he or unhen airport ke hi us transit haul main le jaaya jaataa he, jo philhal istemaal main nahin tha
 Twenty-four hours had passed by now and the news of hijacking of the aircraft had spread around the world
 is puri haijacking kii jaankaree naa sirf idi amin ko thi balki aprahartaaon ko uskaa khulaa samarthan bhi tha
 It is said that Idi Amin used to come to Antby Airport himself every day and take stock of the security system
 28 june 1976, antbi airport, ugandavimaan hijank karne ke baad pehali baar hijakairs ne apni maang rakhi
 The aim of the hijackers was to free 40 Palestinian terrorists in Israeli jails
 iske alaava aatankwaadi kenya, france, switzraland or west germany kii jelon main band apane teraa or saathiyon kii bhi rihaai chaahate the
 Along with the release of a total of 53 terrorists, they also demanded five million US dollars
 maang naa maane jane kii surat main aatankwaadiyone bandhak banaae gayi yatriyon ko ek july 1976 kii subah se ek ek kar maar daalane kii dhamkee di
 That is, the government of Israel was given only 48 hours to accept the demands
 29 june 1976, antbi airport, ugandauganda kii sena airport ke transit haul main kaid musafiron ko do group main baant detii he
 All non-israeli citizens were taken to the waiting hall of the airport and imprisoned
 jabaki air france kru ke 12 member or kul 94 israeli nagarikon ko ek saath usee trojit bool main kaid rakhaa jaataa he
 On 30 June 1976, Antbi Airport, Ugandamangan, was supposed to end on its last day
 isi bich hijakars gaiyr israeli bandhakon main se 48 musafiron ko reeha kar dete hai
 Most of them were elderly and ill
 in sabhi musafiron ko ek special vimaan se paris bhej diya jaataa he
 On July 1, 1976, just before the deferment of Antby Airport, ugandahaiksaires was over, the Israeli government sent a message to the highcars that it was ready for talks
 par unhen kuch or mohalat di jaae
 The kidnappers agree to the Israeli government and extend the deadline to accept the demand by the afternoon of July 4, 1976
 itnaa hi nahin isi ke kuch ghant baad hi wo sau or gaiyr israeli nagarikon ko reeha kar dete hai
 All these people are also sent by special aircraft to Paris
 ab antbi airport ke transit haul main sirf 94 israeli naagarik, france ke das yuva musafir or epper france ke 12 kru member yani kul 116 musafir bache the
 This time was very difficult for the Israeli government
 kyonkin to wo apane nagarikon or flite ke kru members ko is tarah maut ke munh main dhakel sakati thi or na hi aatankwaadiyon kii maangen maan sakati thi
 Because the Israeli government has agreed that they will not deal with terrorists at any cost
 magar israel se itani dur wo bhi apane dushman mulk main ghus kar kaise apane nagarikon ko chhudaayein? ye kaam lagbhag namumican sa tha
 The prolongation of the hijackers was getting closer
 israeli sarkaar ne is dauraan apane mitra africa deshon or duniya ke baaki mulkon se idi amin par dabaav daal kar bandhakon ko reeha karwaane kii tamaam koshishen kin
 But the matter did not work out
 haalanki baatcheet ke saath hi israeli sarkaar rescue oparation ke jariye bandhakon ko reeha karaane kii tarkeeb par bhi kaam kar rahi thi
 On 3 July 1976, the road to the release of the Israeli hostages was closed
 lihaaja teen july kii shaam saadhe chah baje israeli cabinet ne aakhri faisla liya
 Decision Rescue Mission
 brigadier jeneral don shomaron ko oparation kaa commander banaaya gaya
 The plan was extremely risky
 kyonki ye duniya ke kisi bhi airport par ab tak kaa sabase bada or khatarnaak rescue oparation tha
 The Israeli commandos were to complete this mission lightning fast
 lihaaja is oparation ko naam diya gaya oparation thanderbolt
 During this time, the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad was doing its work continuously

 Where the hostages were kept
 iske saath hi hijakars or uganda sena kii sahi-sahi taadaad bhi pataa laga chuki thi
 Meanwhile, Mossad came to know that during the 1960s and 70s an Israeli construction company had built many buildings in many countries of Africa
 yahaan tak ki uganda ke antbi airport kaa wo terminal bhi usee company ne banaaya tha
 With the help of the Israeli engineer who built the terminal of the company, Mossad made a complete map of the place where the hostages were kept
 3 july 1976, shame al shaikh, israelplan ke mutabik sau israeli commandos kii ek team israeli air forsake chaar si-130 harkules transport vimaan se shame al shaikh airport se uganda ke antbi ke liye udaan bharti he
 These special aircraft also had a black Mercedes car and Land Rover cars
 darasal mosaad ne pataa lagaaya tha ki idi amin kaale rang kii marcides kaa shaukeen he or hameshaa usee car main baahar nikalataa he
 While a special protection squad is in the Land Rover car
 tarkeeb ye thi ki airport par utarate hi inhen kaaron main terminal kii taraf kooch kisia jayega
 So that the Ugandan army feels that Idi is Amin's convoy and they enter the terminal easily
 lekin khamoshi ke saath antbi airport par chaar-chaar plane ko land karana aasaan nahin tha
 Uganda had to sneak into the airspace
 bina antbi air trephic control kii jaankaree ke or ye tabhi mumkin tha, jab vimaan behad kam oonchai par ude

 jabaki duusare bowing ko bandhakon ko waapas laane ke liye antbi airport par hi utarana tha
 3 July 1976, Antby Airport, Uganda, 11 am It is precisely when four Israeli Air Force aircraft take off on the runway, flying low and betraying the traffic control of Antby Airport
 raat ke andhere main chaaron vimaan ko airport par kuch is tarah utaara gaya tha ki vahaan maujuud uganda army or aatankwaadiyon ko khabar tak nahin lagi
 The aircraft's cargo gate was already open

 Commandos were already seated in them

 One of these teams was tasked to rescue the passengers held hostage at the airport terminal
 jabaki duusari team ko airport ke ranve par ghaat laga kar baithi uganda kii army or aatankwaadiyon kaa muqabla karnaa tha
 And the responsibility of the third team was to board the rescued passengers in an empty ship
 imaarat main ghuste hi goliyaan chalani shuru ho gai
 Israeli commandos were shouting at Mike in English and Hebrew that "we are Israeli soldiers, lie down lie down
 " commandon ne 3 aparankartaaon ko goli maar di
 Then a 19 year French boy stood up
 commando ne use aparankarta samajha or goli maar di
 Apart from this, two more hostages were also killed in cross firing
 commandos ko dekhakar 3 aparankarta ek duusare kamare main chhip gaye
 But Israeli commandos hurled grenades into that room and opened fire
 teenon maare gaye
 Israeli commandos carried out their plan well
 sabase pehle unhone bandhakon ko apane ghere main liya
 The second team broke out on the Ugandan army

 The commander of the operation, General Adam, himself was sitting in a fifth airplane circling above the airport

 While about 30 Ugandan aircraft standing at the airport were also destroyed by Israeli commands on the go
 taaki koi unka peechha naa kar sake
 Three Israeli hostages were also killed in cross-firing while five commandos were injured
 oparation main israeli unit commander yonthan netanyahu kii maut ho gai
 Yonatan Netanyahu was the elder brother of Israel's current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
 53 minute kaa oparation, 30 minute commando karrwiis puure oparation ke dauraan mosaad ko sirf yahi ek jaan kaa nuksaan hua
 However, 10 commandos were also injured
 videshi zamin par mosaad kaa ye puraa oparation mahaz 53 minute chalaa or jisamen se 30 minute tak commando karrwai chali
 For Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, it was like drinking a sip of blood
 use yakeen hi nahin hua ki koi unke desh main ghus kar apane nagarikon ko chudaa kar le ja saktaa he
 The formula for the alliance between BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra is yet to be decided
 bijepi jahaan ek taraf shivasena ke saath gathbandhan ke liye sari koshishen kar rahi he
 On the other hand, the Shiv Sena is also busy bargaining with the BJP, realizing the opportunity
 shivasena 1995 main bal thakare ke model ke aadhaar par bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kii baat kar rahi he
 According to the report of English newspaper Economics Times, Shiv Sena is eyeing the 1995 model
 bijepi ke saath gathbandhan karne ke liye shivasena maharashtra kii 288 siton vaali vidhansabha main kareeb 150 siten or loksabhaa chunaav ke liye maharashtra kii kul 48 siton main se 25-26 siton par daawa kar rahi he
 Shiv Sena has sent this demand to the BJP high command
 sutron kii maane to shivasena ne kaha ki maharashtra main gathbandhan kii baat tabhi jab use 1995 ke model ke tahat sahyogi banaaya jaae
 In fact, for the first time in Maharashtra, the BJP and Shiv Sena coalition government was formed in 1995 and the crown of the Chief Minister was punished by Manohar Joshi of Shiv Sena
 shivasena ne bijepi ke saath gathbandhan karne ke liye pehla suzav diya he ki fadanvis kii sarkaar bhang kar di jaae or maharashtra main vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav ek saath hi karaae jaaen
 Apart from this, Shiv Sena has placed another condition to be given the post of Chief Minister
 itnaa hi nahin shivasena bijepi se maharashtra vidhansabha kii kul 288 siton main se 150 siten chaahati he
 In this way, out of 48 seats in the Lok Sabha, 25 to 26 seats are in demand
 haalanki shivasena kii in teenon maangon ko bijepi aasaani se maanane vaali nahin he, kyonki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main shivasena kii inhen jidon ke chalate akele chunavi maidan main utari thi
 BJP came to be the largest party and later Shiv Sena had to form government with it
 vahiin, bijepi ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar shivasena ke jis tarah se tevar hai usase lagata he ki wo aasaani se maanane vaali nahin he
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut is constantly seen on the forums of the opposition

 Mobile phone brand Oppo (OPPO) is known not only for its ability to bring unique features to its flagship device, but also to offer it in a more affordable range
 is tarah se usne mobile innovations ko mukhyadhara kii cheez bana di he, na ki aisi cheez jo sirf aalaa darje main hi simit ho
 The OPPO K1 model has also come under this glorious tradition, it includes many features that are usually found in more expensive phones
 lekin yah divaais keemat or aakaar, donon lihaaj se aapke pocket main samaane laayak he
 One more thing about OPPO K1 is the first thing you will notice - at a time when phones are getting bigger, the K1 is a surprisingly small phone
 yah 158
 3mm tall and very slim, just 74mm thin
 iske front main 6
 There is a 41-inch full HD + (2340 x 1080) display and the special thing is that it is with AMOLED
 ek cheez par aapkaa dhyaan jayega ki is divaais ke front yaa back main kahin bhi fingerprint scinar nahin dikhataa
 The reason for this is that it is below the screen - in fact the K1 comes with an in-display fingerprint scanner, which provides faster and more accurate display
 is smartphone main bejal na ke baraabar hai or isliye aapako badhiya disple milti he
 The screen to body ratio of this device is 91 percent
 phone ko palatney par aap iske 3D main dhale body ko dekh hairat main pad jaaenge
 The K1 phone is available in two colors: Astral Blue and Piano Black
 lekin mobile kii back body par roshni ke asar se iske badalte shed dekh aap chamatkrit rah jaaenge
 This is because of the extremely tight lines created by the IMT 3D injection molding process of inductive nano scale
 lite or shadow ke is sanyog se tarah-tarah ke shed or rang dikhte hai, jisase phone kii apni vishisht chamak dikhti he
 Due to so much brightness, the K1 phone looks like a jewel, though it is not so delicate either
 iske front main corning gorilla glass 5 he or isaki vajah se phone ke solid hone kaa bharosa jamata he
 There is also good hardware inside its stunning design and solid texture
 iskaa disple phul HD+ AMOLED he or is divaais ko takat detaa he iskaa snapadragon 660 procesar, jiske pradarshan ko kisi saboot kii jarurat nahin
 When the Snapdragon 660 processor comes with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage (which can be expanded via micro SD card), this smartphone works well in everything from gaming to multi tasking
 gaming main sirf makkhan jaisi sahajata se aage bhi kuch chaahate hai? to yah jaan len ki OPPO K1 aise hyper boost mod ke saath aata he, jisase ki divaais gaming ke liye behatar se behatar istemaal hota he
 This phone comes with special features for games, so that they can be enjoyed more easily
 kya aap apane phone main regular gaming anubhav chaahate hai? to ise normal mod main rakhie
 But if you want more good things, then go into hyper boost mode
 abhi tak hamane camaron kii charchaa nahin kii he
 So they are extraordinary according to the best tradition of OPPO
 is brand ne selfi ko joshpurna or sateek bana diya he, K1 main aisa camera he jo ki selfi shoot karne ke anubhav ko nai paribhaasha detaa he
 It has a great 25 megapixel f / 2
 0 aparchar vaala camera he jisase bahut badhiya tasviir milti he
 The rear camera is also no less
 OPPO K1 main do rear camere hai
 Of this, the main camera 16 megapixels and the larger f / 1
 75 aparchar ke saath or doosraa camera 2 mega picksal ke gahare sensor vaala
 Like their front-facing relatives, these cameras are also very sensible - they can quite intelligently recognize the combination of 16 scenes and 120 scenes and adjust the colors accordingly to make your picture look more vibrant and bright
 inamen portret mod main AI kaa bhi kamaal dikhataa he, jisase camere boke ke saath tasviren lene main sakasham hote hai
 These pictures are awesome, they do not look unnatural
 nateeja? aap aisi samrudh tasviren pate hai jinke na keval rang behatar hote hai, balki unki baariki bhi khub hoti he
 Of course, all of this requires a lot of power and hence the OPPO K1 has a large 3600 mah battery, which enables your device to be easily used throughout the day to normal
 bydaree ke asaadhaaran rup se lambey life kii ek vajah yah ek tathy bhi he ki OPPO K1 kaa software iske liye optimij kiya gaya he
 This phone Android 8
 1 par chalata he, jiske saath oppo kaa kaaphi prashansit coloros 5
 2 is given
 isse na keval yah sunishchit hota he ki aap divaais par ek sahaj or samrudh feechar hasil kar saken, balki isamen smart assistant or smart cidbaar jaise special feechar bhi aate hai, jo aapako phone par saamaanya se zyada kuch kar sakane main sakasham banaate hai
 Yes, this phone also has a fast speed face unlock feature, so that you have an option to unlock the phone
 or yah sab aapaki ummiido ke anuroop sirf 16,990 rupye kii keemat main
 Perhaps in the case of OPPO K1, price is the only thing that is not high
 baaki sab kuch cheekh-cheekh kar bataane vaale hai ki yah ‘hai and’ kaa phone he- behtareen AMOLED disple, in disple fingerprint scinar, AI aadhaarit photography or nishchit rup se, najaron ko aakarshith karne vaala dizin tathaa behtareen pradarshan
 This phone will be available on Flipkart from February 12
 yahi nahin, pehali baar OPPO smartphone aath maheene tak 90 fisadi bybech vailu ke saath uplabdh kiya gaya he, or bank discount alag se he
 This means that the effective cost of OPPO K1 will be almost zero in the buyback period for the consumer
 is tarah OPPO K1 kii keemat vaise to 16,990 rupee he, lekin yah aath maheene ke liye 1,690 rupee ke atirikt bank discount or 90 fisadi bybech vailu ke saath 15,300 rupee tak kii keemat main uplabdh hoga
 So overall it can be said that Oppo along with K1 has provided high level performance to the people without putting much cut in bank account

 aise main mehmaan team ko england ke saath hone vaale mukaable main apni 'alternet jersey' (vaikalpik jersey) kaa upyog karnaa hoga, jo naarangi hogi
 On the saffron selection of orange for icc's Safai Team India, the ICC said, "the BCCI was given many color options and chose the one that suits them better with the color of the jersey
 yah isliye karnaa padaa kyonki england kii team bhi bharat kii tarah nile rang kaa hi jersey pahenti he
 The design is taken from India's old T20 jersey, which had an orange color
 'isisi ne kaha, 'is jersey ko dizin karne vaale diziner america main baithe hai

 Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Asim Azmi said that the central government is behind this decision, it is part of the increasing saffronisation in the country

 a Muslim was the one who designed the Indian tricolor
 tirange main anya rang hai, keval naarangi hi kyon chune? yah behatar hoga ki unki jersey tirange par aadhaarit ho
 At the same time, former minister and Congress MLA Nasim Khan said that the Modi government is doing saffron politics
 unhone kaha, 'jab se modi sarkaar satta main ai he, tab se vah bhagava raajnneeti kar rahi he
 The tricolor should be respected and national harmony should be promoted

 diarector sanjay gupta bollywood main 25 saal bitaa chuke hai
 There were many ups and downs in his career but he managed to come back every time

 For Sanjay Gupta, who made films like Kaante, Zinda, Musafir, Shootout Series, there was a period when he left the industry and was not expecting a comeback but he is ready with his project once again
 sanjay gupta actor sanjay dutt ke saath dosti or tanaav ko lekar bhi surkhiyaan bator chuke hai
 In an interview with PTI, he said that my first film Aatish came 25 years ago
 uski casting mere liye mushkil nahin thi
 Due to Sanjay Dutt, that film was able to be made easily because it was not easy to make films at that time without the presence of a star
 sanjay gupta ne iske baad kaante film kaa nirdesan kiya
 The film included many stars like Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, Lucky Ali, Mahesh Manjrekar
 kaante ke saath hi sanjay gupta gangster thriller filmon main apane aapako sthapit kar chuke the
 However, this only made things worse for him

 meri film shootout at wadala kii relies ke chaar saal pehle tak mere halaat kharaab the
 90 percent people in the film industry did not want to work with me because i had a bad relationship with Sanju
 haalanki diarector ne ye bhi kaha ki sanjay dutt ne kabhi logon ko sidhe taur par nahin kaha ki ve sanjay gupta ke saath kaam naa karen lekin sanju ke aasapaas rahane vaale logon ne gupta ke saath project main shaamil naa hone ke liye kehete the
 Talking about it, he said, 'that was a very bad phase for me
 maine lagbhag haar maan hi lee thi
 i started working in a hotel in Khandala and i started going there four days a week
 mujhe laga yahi meraa bhavishya he kyonki mujhe industry main ab kaam milane vaala nahin he

 maine 15 saal kii umr main kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Made his first film at the age of 22 and now how can i give up at the age of 40? He called Ekta Kapoor and talked to him about the shootout sequence
 iske baad unhone jon abraham or anil kapur se mulaakaat kii thi
 Although these stars were also told not to work with Sanjay Gupta, but Anil Kapoor had supported Sanjay Gupta in this case and said that if Sanju would tell me directly that i should not work with Sanjay Gupta
 So i will not
 sanjay gupta ne anil kapur ke samarthan kii tarif kii thi
 In 2015, Sanjay Dutt came exclusively to meet Sanjay Gupta on the sets and Sanjay Gupta happily tweeted that Sanju is stepping on his set after 8 years which he described as a great feeling

 deep kalrasaal dar saal jab media bharat ke sarvshereshth bijness skulon ke bare main report karata he, tab vah saans rokkar hamen desh ke sheersh sansthaanon ke selary package or placement ke bare main bataata he
 i doubt there will be any change in the coming days
 aakhirkaar jo log moti tankhwaah kii korporate naukariyaan hasil karke aarthik avarodhon ko toduya chaahate hai, unke liye yah khush hone or jashn manaane kii swaabhaavik vajah he—ek aisi academik sanstha jahaan se sheersh bijness agxcutive nikalate hai or phir duniyabar main apni kaabiliyat kaa danka bajaate hai
 In many B-schools in India, the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (or IIM-A) is, to put it simply, at the pinnacle of management education
 is santhaan kii duniya bhar main kaayam pratishtha tab or pukhta ho jaati he jab nami-giraami companiyaan placement sijan ke dauraan yahaan aati hai or yahaan ke graduate chaatro main se chunakar le jaati hai
 However, this is a recent trend — i still remember a time when surprise salary packages were not common in B-school placement campaigns
 misaal ke liye, info age (jo job portal naukari dot com kii maalik he) ke sansthaapak sanjeev bhikachandani mujhe bataate hai ki jab 1989 main unhone iiem-e se grajuation kiya tha, tab graduate chaatro kii bhartee ke liye zyada companiyaan campus main nahin aati thim
 However, by the time of 1992, things had become much like what they are today
 tab tak kansalting form or emmemasiji (fast mowing kanjumar guds) companiyaan campus main aane lageen or us saal duniya bhar main jaani-maani kansalting form maikinji ne do graduate yahaan se liye the or kisi bhi bhartiya bijness skool se usne pehali baar aisi bhartiyon kii thim
 However, ahead of the narrow perspective of placements and well-heeled salaries in well-known companies, IIMA is considered one of the best due to its highly qualified professors, peer groups and the multi-faceted education of the institute
 goes
 yahaan milane vaali shiksha chaatro ko jindagi bhar ke liye gadhati he
 Institutions like IIM-A were highly respected in the past only because of their basic excellence — it is a privilege to pursue higher education from the best institutions
 maine bachaler degree ke liye saint stephens main daakhila liya or arthshaastra kii padhai kii
 During the entire session, i did not hit my hands and feet much, but i was sure in my mind what to do after that
 bhartiya prabandh sansthaanon main se ek ke jariye korporate kariyar kaa rasta sabase swaabhaavik vikalp maaloom detaa tha (yah alag baat he ki maine korporate kariyar main bahut lambey samay tak nahin rahane kaa faisla kiya or naukari ke kuch hi varshon baad khud apane udhyam main haath aajamaaya)
 After graduating from St
 Stephen's i applied to IIM, XLRI and FMS
 maine jitne bhi bi-skool main aavedan kiya tha, un sabhi se intervyuu kaa bulaava aana khaasi utsaah badhaane vaali baat thi, par jab mujhe iiem ahmedabad main daakhila mil gaya, tab mujhe laga ki meri mehnat sachmuch rang laai he
 When you are successful in getting admission in the best B-school in the country, then initially you feel that you are a Turram Khan
 lekin jaldi hi aapako ehsaas hone lagata he ki bhale hi aap apane chote-se talab kii badi machhlee rahe hon, lekin jab aap vishaal samudr main aate hai tab aap vaaki khaksaar hai or aapaki koi ahmiyat nahin he
 The first manake (management accounting) quiz hit me on the ground in a jolt
 yah meri jindagi kii akeli badi haar thi
 i was very sad because i had never met such numbers before
 main jaanata tha ki ab qamar kas lene kaa vakt aa gaya he
 i got my rut very soon
 iiem-e se padhai karne ke asaadhaaran pahaluon main ek yah he ki aapako sabase shandaar prophessoron se seekhney ko miltaa he—aise professor jo aapke upar vyapak or tikshn dhang se sochane ke liye, samasyaon ko thik-thik pahchaanane or paribhaashit karne ke liye or unhen vyavasthit or susangat dhang se hal karne ke liye jor daalate hai
 Professor A
 ke
 i remember studying from Jain, who has been an unmatched teacher and taught 40 batches of IIM-A graduates
 unhone hamen prerit kiya ki ham apane saamne aane vaale harek tathy or aankade ke sateek vishleshan se kam kisi bhi cheez par samjhauta na karen
 Those of us who have had case discussions with them and have been called to present the presentation in the classroom, can never forget how they used to show 'why' and 'so what' and find the right answer
 Used to put a lot of emphasis on us
 desh ke sabase chatur sujan chaatro main kuch hone ko lekar jo bhi aaramdaayak bhram hamaare man main rahe hon, ve usee kshan teji se nestnabud ho gaye jab hamane khud ko unke chaanbin karne vaale sawaalon ke ghere main paaya
 It took us a long time to learn that to find the right answer, you have to ask the right question first
 isane hamen vinamrata ke bhi do-ek sabak padhaaye
 IIMA is one of the first institutes in the country to adopt the innovative method of case study to learn the principles of management
 yah aplide larning par santhaan ke focus kaa ek udhaaharan he
 The case study method not only enhances student-teacher engagement, but also encourages greater interaction and dialogue between students, leading to participatory learning and the habit of group work
 iiem-e main yah navonmeshi koshish harvard bijness skool ke saath milakar kaam karne se ai he or aaj yahaan ke shikshakon or chaatro kii jindagi kaa dhang ban gai he
 While being surrounded by some of the most talented and talented individuals in the country, a highly competitive environment and unwavering education instills fear and reverence, the students' ability to fulfill their other interests can also come as a surprise
 paathyakram se jude atyant kathor kaaryon ke baavjood iiem-e dheron pathetar gatividhiyon—khel, vaad-vivaad, faikalti ke saath anaupchaarik baatcheet tathaa or bhi bahut kuch—ke avasar muhaiyaa karata he taaki sarvangin vyaktitv viksit karne main chaatro kii madad kii ja sake
 Its old campus has been carved into the famous Louis Kahn's early ornate style of architecture — entirely of red bricks — and the new campus made of gray cement now supports it
 alabatta ye chaatro or aagantukon, donon ke liye samaan rup se aakarshak bane hue hai
 What makes the institute even more remarkable is its state-of-the-art infrastructure and curriculum designed for the future, which it presents to prepare the leaders of tomorrow
 ise keval vidambnaa se bharaa badlaav kaha ja saktaa he ki 1990 ke dashak main iiem-e udhyamshiltaa kaa ek course muhaiyaa karata tha, jise maine us vakt chunaa
 Later in my life, i learned that instead of spending a corporate life, i wanted to build something on my own
 emb karne ke baad maine ab amro or phir jeei mani main kuch vakt kaam kiya
 But the lack of realization of personal achievement kept niggling within me and i was flirting to do more
 mujhe internet kaa keedaa lag chukaa tha or main maanata tha ki internet jis tarah us vakt tak acolpaneey dhang se soochna ko loktantric bana rahaa tha, usko dekhte hue saamaanya kaamkaaj main bada or sarthak badlaav aane vaala he
 It started with a meeting with a venture capitalist at a mall in Mumbai — we enthusiastically wrote a new business plan on a paper napkin and the rest is history
 mujhe yah kehete hue khushi ho rahi he ki yah santhaan aaj pehle se kahin zyada udhyamiyon ko taiyaar kar rahaa he
 Some students don't even get involved in placements to start something on their own — they may be a small part, but they are just getting started
 jis vakt maine khud apana kaam shuru karne ke liye apni korporate naukari ko tilanjali di, main iiem-e ke kuch mutthibhar logon main se tha, jinhone alag rasta chunaa tha
 Then there are alumni who are choosing the path of becoming social entrepreneurs and challenging the notion that only capitalist leaders leave from business schools
 give india sareekhe sanghathan, jo pramanit non-proffit daandaataaon kii funding kii vyavastha karte hai; bharat main microlending kaa navonmeshi sanghathan basix yaa prayaas sareekhe charity sanghathan iiem-e ke purv chaatro ne sthapit kiye hai or ve hi inhen chalaa rahe hai
 Working closely with the world's best business schools, deep involvement in research, with eminent scholars including Nobel laureates coming to campus and the changing needs of IIMA-A world-class education as a center of innovative incubation and entrepreneurship
 Doing steps iskaa purv chaatr hone ke naate mere liye purvaagrah se mukt ho paanaa mushkil he, par is santhaan, iske shikshakon or purv chaatro ke network ke saath sampark main rahane ke chalate main iiem-e ke bhavishya ko lekar behad ashanvit hum

 *** The people of the country are troubled by the closure of 500-1000 rupee notes, foreign diplomats living in India and those who use Indian currency abroad are also in a lot of trouble
 is babat videsh mantralay ko mukhya taur par teen-chaar tarah kii shikaayatein mili hai
 The first complaint came from foreign diplomats living in Delhi
 unka kahana he ki duutavas yaa ucchayog ko zyaada naqdi kii zarurat hoti he
 The limit placed at the time of withdrawal and exchange of notes is not sufficient for them
 inaki duusari shikaayat ye he ki inhone counslar or visa fees ke taur par jo puraane note liye hai unka kya hoga
 How they will be deposited or how they will be changed
 diplomatic kor ke dean ne videsh mantralay ke adhikariyon se mulaaqaat kar in samasyaon kii jaankaree di
 Apart from diplomats residing in India, the complaint has also come from the Non Resident Indian (NRI) who holds Indian currency abroad
 haalanki ek seemaa se zyaada bhartiya mudra videsh nahin le jaayi ja sakati
 But those who have currency within the prescribed limit and they are not coming to India at present, then what will happen to their 500-1000 notes
 ve puraane noton ke badale nae note kaise paaenge
 Such questions are being asked from the Ministry of External Affairs
 teesri shikaayat baahar ke deshon main bhartiya mudra badalane vaale association kii taraf se ai he
 What will the agents of the Indian rupee give in exchange for the currency of other countries of the world? tippaniyan There is also a big problem of tourists coming to India
 khaas taur par jo ilaaj ke liye bharat aa rahe hai unki alag tarah kii zarurat he
 They require thick cash
 videsh mantralay ne in tamaam shikayaton or sawaalon ko vitt vibhaag ko bhej diya he

 The Ministry of External Affairs says that only after getting the decision of the committee and its guidelines, it will be able to answer the complaints and questions

 He says that the embassy or high commission needs more cash
 noton kii nikasi or badale jane kii philhal jo seemaa rakhi gai he, vah inke liye paryaapt nahin he
 Their second complaint is that what will happen to the old notes they have taken as counselor and visa fees
 unhen kaise jamaa kiya jayega yaa phir ve kaise badale jaaenge
 The Dean of Diplomatic Corps met the officials of the Ministry of External Affairs and informed them about these problems
 bharat main rahane vaale rajanyikon ke alaava shikaayat non resident indian (enarai) kii taraf se bhi ai he jinke paas videsh main bhartiya mudra he
 However, more than a limit, Indian currency cannot be taken abroad
 lekin jinke paas tay seemaa main mudra he or ve philhal bharat nahin aa rahe to aise main unke 500-1000 ke noton kaa kya hoga
 How will they get new notes instead of old ones
 is tarah ke sawaal videsh mantralay se puche ja rahe hai
 The third complaint came from the Association of Indian Currency Converters in Outside Countries
 duniya ke duusare deshon kii karency ke badale bhartiya rupaya dene vaale agent ab bade noton kaa kya karenge
 The comments ek badi pareshaani bharat aane vaale sailaaniyon kii bhi he
 Especially those who are coming to India for treatment have different needs
 unhen moti naqdi kii zarurat hoti he
 The Ministry of External Affairs has sent all these complaints and questions to the Finance Department
 vitt vibhaag ne is maamle main atirikt sachiv ke netritv main ek inter ministrial cameti bana di he
 a senior joint secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs is also included in this committee

 desh kii arthvyavastha kii 'badahaali' par kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ko gherne ke baad bijepi ke varisht netaa yashavanth sinha ne ab kashmir ke mudde par modi sarkaar ko nishane par liya he
 Sinha states that "india has lost the people of the valley emotionally
 " sinha ne yah bhi kaha ki pakistan kashmir masale main 'jaruri teesraa paksh' he, jisase inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This comment by Sinha may pass on to the BJP leadership
 'di vir' ko die ek intervyuu main sinha se unke us aalekh ke bare main bhi poocha gaya jisamen unhone desh kii arthvyavastha kii 'badahaali' kaa mudda uthaaya tha
 Sinha termed the success of government schemes like Mudra Bank and various reforms as 'exaggerated claims'
 bijepi netaa ne kaha, "main jammu-kashmir main bade paimaane par logon ke algaav ko dekh rahaa hum
 This is something that bothers me a lot
 hamane un logon ko bhaavnaatmak taur par kho diya he
 You have to visit the valley to understand that they did not trust us
 "aapako bataa den ki sinha ek naagarik samaaj sanghathan 'consarnd citigens group' (sisiji) kaa netritv karte hai, jisane haal ke samay main kai baar ghati kaa daura kiya he or vibhinn pakshon se samvaad kiya he taaki dashakon puraane kashmir mudde kaa sthaayee samaadhaan talasha ja sake
 CCG includes Justice (retd) AP Shah, former Mumbai Police Commissioner Julio Ribeiro, former Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah, former Intelligence Agency 'RAW' AS Dulat, noted social worker Aruna Roy and noted writer and historian Ramachandra Guha Many other dignitaries are involved
 pakistan kashmir main teesraa jaruri pakshasinha ne kaha, "
 
 
 
 
 At the same time i would also say that Pakistan, unfortunately, is a third necessary party in Jammu and Kashmir
 or isliye yadi aap antim samaadhaan chaahate hai to hamen kisi na kisi vakt pakistan ko isamen shaamil karnaa hoga
 Yes, you can't pull it off forever
 " bijepi netaa ne niyantran rekha par logon ke maare jane par roak lagane kii apil kii, kyonki vahaan koi bhi yuddh nahin jeetne ja rahaa
 No time to meet Modi, Sinha said, "there should be a ban on killing people along the Line of Control, because there is no war going on
" niyantran rekha acchhee tarah paribhaashit he or kargil main yah sabit ho gaya ki duniya is mudde par pakistan ke saath nahin balki hamaare saath he
 You cannot change the control line
 to kyon na niyantran rekha par shanti ho
 Despite all our differences with Pakistan, peace can be maintained along the Line of Control
 " sinha ne daawa kiya ki unhone 10 maheene pehle kashmir mudde par charchaa ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi se milane kaa vakt maanga tha, lekin unhen 'dukh' he ki milane kaa samay nahin mil sakaa
 The former finance minister said, “I am sad
 main nishchit taur par dukhi hum
 You ask for an appointment, 10 months have passed
 main aapako bataa duun ki jab se main saarvajanik jivan main aayaa hum, rajeev gandhi se lekar bharat ke kisi pradhanmantri ne mujhe milane kaa vakt dene se manaa nahin kiya
 No Prime Minister told Yashwant Sinha that i do not have time for you
 " unhone kaha, "or yah mere apane pradhanmantri hai jinhone mere saath aisa vyavhaar kiya
 In such a situation, if someone calls me and says please come to me, then sorry, time has passed
 mujhase bura bartaav kiya gaya
 "the counterattack on Jaitley also targeted Jaitley for his remarks that it was a 'demotion' to replace him as the foreign minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
 unhone kaha, "jetali yah kaise kah sakate hai ki vitt se hataakar videsh mantralay dena mere liye padavnati thi? kya jetali ji yah kahana chaahate hai ki maujuuda videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj puri tarah mahatvaheen prabhaar sambhaal rahi hai? koi is par yakeen nahin karne vaala
