 Expressing concern over the misuse of the anti-dowry law by 'disgruntled' wives against their husbands and other in-laws, the Supreme Court has arranged that in such cases the police cannot 'automatically' arrest the accused and take such steps The reason for this will be given, which will be judicially reviewed

 ’ buddhadev ne kaha ki maovadiyon or trinmul congress ke bich ‘mili bhagat’ he or unhone is baat ko kendriya grahamantri pi chidambaram ko bataa diya he haalanki ve ‘isko pasand nahin karte’ hai
 Bhattacharya said that instead of blaming each other, the Center and states should work together to deal with Naxalites
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘jab bhi main grahamantri se miltaa hum, main unhen bataata hum ki (trinmul congress or maovadi) aapas main mili huye hai
 This is a serious problem
 ’ chidambaram kii pratikriya ke bare main bhattacharya ne kaha, ‘jaisaa kii pehle se he unhone ise pasand nahin kiya
 The Home Minister does not like any party, person, NGO or media supporting the Maoists
 ’ buddhadev ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kii america or brazil kii yatra se lautne ke baad vah unase mulaakaat karenge
 He said, 'we have to rethink our strategy and plans

 He said that the areas under 28 police stations are affected by it

 ’mukhyamantri ne kaha ki maovadi samasya mahaj kanoon evam vyavastha se judi samasya nahin he balki hamen saath saath vikaas kaaryo ko bhi aage badhaane kii jarurat he
 Asked why there was no development in these areas, Buddhadev asked, 'it seems that you have not gone to these areas

 If you compare this with Kolkata's standard of living then you will make a wrong assumption
 ’buddhadev ne maovadi netaa kishanji ke ghayal hone yaa nahin hone ke bare main puche gaye prashn par koi bhi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya

 input-ians dilli main congress ke saath gathbandhan kii taaja sugabugahat ke bich aam aadmi party ne ek baar phir akele chunaav ladane kii baat ko doharaaya he
 Recently, Delhi Congress leader PC Chacko justified the talk of an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party
 jiske baad aap netaa gopal raay se ajtak ne khaas baatcheet main poocha ki kya ab dilli main congress ke saath gathbandhan kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he? jawaab main raay ne kaha ki congress chunaav ladane kii bajaay khud kii uljhan main fansi hui he
 Rai said that with the implementation of the code of conduct, the election time is coming closer
 is bich shila dikshit, pisi chaako or rahul gandhi alag-alag bayaan de rahe hai, aise main gathbandhan ko lekar congress apni raay spasht kare
 He said that Sheila Dixit had told Rahul Gandhi after the meeting that his party would not form an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party
 shila dikshit ke is bayaan ke baad aam aadmi party ne faisla liya ki samay behad kam he, isliye 6 ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar di gai he or aam aadmi party apane ummidavaaron ke saath 1 march se campan shuru kar chuki he
 Apart from this, when asked on the statement of the Congress leader, will the Aam Aadmi Party try to take a step forward for the alliance? Gopal Rai replied that the Aam Aadmi Party does not have to go one step further
 chunaav sir par hai or aam aadmi party ne congress kii duvidha ko dekhte hue akele chunavi zamin par utarane kaa faisla le liya he
 Gopal Rai was asked if there was no scope for an alliance with the Congress? Gopal Rai said that we are not thinking about the alliance, the focus of the Aam Aadmi Party is to fight and win the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone kaha ki haal hi main shila dikshit ne narendra modi kii tarif kii or phir ajay maakan bhi alag bayaan de rahe hai
 It seems that the Congress does not want to enter the 2019 elections
 isliye aam aadmi party desh se taanaashaahee sarkaar ko hataane ke liye kaam karegi or dilli main apane dam par chunaav ladane kii ranneeti bana rahi he
 Gopal Rai claimed that at present there is no dialogue with the Congress
 aam aadmi party sabhi siton par akele chunaav ladegi
 Gopal Rai says that the Congress is only giving statements on the alliance, there is no official dialogue yet
 aise main congress kii bayaanbazi ke chakravyuuh main apni urja barbaad karne kii bajaay aam aadmi party dilli kii janata ke saath milakar loksabhaa chunaav ladegi

 rang sakshilekhak: jayadev tanejaprakashakah takshashila prakashanmoolyah 1,995 ru
 The book, covering half the century of the Sarahindi theater, is based on a stage performance rather than a critique of the play
 jayadev taneja dilli main rahete hae 1960 se aaj tak yahaan manchit hone vaale lagbhag har naatak ke darshak, prekshak or sameekshak rahe hai
 Rang Sakshi is the result of this attachment to the world of drama and theater
 sahi arthon main yah naatak kii aalochana par kendrit na hokar manch prastuti par aadhaarit he
 Perhaps this is the right way to discuss a genre like drama
 agar ham maatr naatak ke aalekh par bhi baat karen to usamen rangamanchi tatwon or sambhaavnaaon kii upasthiti ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The four-volume book covers about half of Indian, especially Hindi theater
 is drushti se rangamanch ke shodharthiyon ke saath-saath saamaanya darshakon ke liye bhi yah strot saamagree atyant mahatv kii he
 Through this, we can gather the necessary information about every play staged at the Delhi Theater from 1974 to 2007
 acha hota, lekhak ne ise 1962 se shuru kiya hota jise unhone asadha kaa ek din vaale lekh se rekhaankit bhi kiya he
 However, the report of a total of 1,000 presentations is a truly commendable effort
 pehle khand main paanch naatakon par vistrut lekh hai jo unki prastutiyon ke bahaane likhe gaye hai
 This drama is: a Day of Aashad, Half Incomplete, Tughlaq, Andha Yug and Charandas Chor
 in naatakon kii prastuti hindi rangamanch kii ullekhneey ghatana rahi he
 Charandas Chor may have been known as a presentation but his article was not much discussed
 is suchi main agar ek-ek naatak vijay tendulkar or badal sarkaar kaa hota to bhartiya rangamanch kii yah tasviir puri ho jaati
 The second section is the most important from the point of view of history, under which almost every theatrical performance from 1974 to 2007 is combined with criticism and criticism
 aisi rapaton ke liye lekhak ne veeksha shabd kaa prayog kiya he, jiskaa notice liya janaa jaruri he
 More than the concept of word, the documentary importance of the material available in this section should be kept in mind
 pichley bees-pachchis varshon main bhartiya rangamanch main natya samarohon kii baadh-si aa gai he
 Now every theater group prepares drama for the ceremony itself
 vah daur to durlabh hi ho gaya he, jab koi natya dal apni ichha, apane sansadhano or apane kaarykram ke anusaar naatak kaa manchan kare
 Overall, the above establishment is confirmed by the description of 75 Natyotsavas
 kitaab ke antim khand main atharah rang varshon kaa vaarshik akalan he
 Like other forms of literature, the Theater Annual Report and Assessment is very important because through this we are interviewed with the idiom and tone of theater from year to year
 kitaab ke peeche ke lekhak ke parishram, lagan or jijeevishaa ko dekhakar aashcharya hota he
 But it is also important to pay attention to some mistakes
 pehle khand main tughlaq kii jis prastuti ko aadhaar banaaya gaya he, vah 1973 main nahin 1972 main pehali baar manchit hui thi

 This is the first instance of its kind of 'rainbow wading' for the LGBT community in Kolkata
 tista das or deepan chakravarti ne apni shaadi kaa elaan is saal april main hi kar diya tha
 The 38-year-old Teesta is a well-known name in Kolkata's transgender community

 At the same time, 40-year-old Deepan belongs to Lumding in Assam

 ye bahut kathin safar tha
 We had to face tough social stereotypes
 isliye ye din hamaari zindagiyon main khaas mahatv rakhata he
 What is new is the fact that we can choose our spouse
 ”deepan bhi khushi kaa izhaar karte nahin thakte
 Says Deepan, 'this is a small step to a new beginning

 According to Sinha, transgenders still do not have most of the rights like inheritance which any other citizen enjoys

 unhone sari ummiden free basics se paal rakhi hai
 It is a new platform that will first allow Internet users to access a few select websites, especially in rural India, to create one billion new internet users in India
 is badbhole daawey ke baavjood ki “free basics” ek paropkaaree koshish he, taaki un logon tak internet kii pahunch banaai jaae jo abhi uski keemat adaa nahin kar sakate, is koshish ko andeh kii najar se dekha ja rahaa he
 The plan is currently stuck due to opposition from start-up companies promoters, academics and many people who are worried that the new platform will secretly seize the digital reach of millions of poor Indians and control consumers
 un logon ke virodh ke chalate, jo yah maanate hai ki free basics kaa pravesh internet ke istemaal ke tareekon kii bharatiyon kii aazaadee ko baadhit kar saktaa he, bhartiya doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran (tri) ne philhal is yojana par roak laga rakhi he
 He has to decide on this and submit recommendations by the end of January
 lekin jukerbarg or free basics ne ek joardaar prachaar abhiyaan ched rakhaa he jisamen akhabaaron main vigyaapan die ja rahe hai or tri ko prabhavit karne ke liye fasebuk upabhoktaaon kii taraf se online abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he
 In this, they are stressing that a limited form of Internet is being made available free of cost through free basics, including Facebook's social networking site and message services, as well as news, health, job sites and select farming information
 Will be provided free basics ne fasebuk upabhoktaaon ko ek sandesh main kaha he ki “yah un logon kii madad karti he jo data ke liye bhugtan karne kii haisiyat nahin rakhte hai yaa jinhen online shuruyaat karne ke liye madad chahie
 And it is open to all
 ”pichley saal shuru kiye jane ke kuch hi maheenon baad jab iskaa naam internet
 If it was changed from ORG to free basics, Facebook tried to remove all the apprehensions about it
 usne yah sanket diya ki yah plateform keval un websiton or sevaaon ke liye nahin he jinhen vah chunegi balki sabhi developers ke liye khulaa he basharte ve plateform ke takneekee maanakon par khare utarate hon
 But these standards are being decided by a company which has the right to change these standards anytime in future
 aalochakon kii daleel he ki bhale hi ise sweekaar kiya jaataa yaa nahin, lekin is pahal ko sakaaratmak tareeke se to avashya dekha jaataa agar vah doorsanchaar seva pradaataaon ko sabsidi dekar garibon ko muft or purna internet pahunch uplabdh karaati
 However, Facebook has not hidden the fact that Free Basics is a business that has its own economic interests
 isiilie usne deshbhar main pahunch ke liye reliance communications ke saath qaraar kiya he
 While its intention is to grab a large chunk of online advertising revenue, Reliance aims to get more consumers for its data services
 virodhiyon kii daleel he ki yah seva net-nirpekshata kii guarantee nahin detii
 He believes that the basic objective of Free Basics is to increase the level of consumer data it is getting and to gain commercial benefits from it in future
 phir, niztaa (privesi) kanoon na hone ke chalate is tarah kii sari jaankaree ke durupyog kaa bhi khatra he
 Scientists from various iits and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, have also questioned the Facebook model and said that this social network makes all content in their basics app public (public) which is a threat to the safety of users
 Can

 The householders also leave the work of snakes and trade for fruits

 Sooraj Barjatya returns after a long time with Salman, so he tries to cash Salman completely, but in this affair he completely deviates from the story
 shaayad vah filmameking ke usee jamaane ke formule ko apana rahe hai jo vah do dashak pehle apanaaya karte the
 But in those times, he used to walk with a story which is completely missing this time
 vah puri tarah se salmaan khan kii star power par savaar najar aate hai
 As far as Salman is concerned, he has the potential to drag his fans to theaters
 lekin front ro se sitiyon kaa na bajnaa ishaara kar detaa he ki shaayad is baar salmaan ke diahard phans ke liye vah cheez nahin he jiske ve diwane hai
 It can be said that it is the weakest of Salman's previous films
 kahani main kitna damakahani ek riyasat kii he
 Who has a crown prince
 jiske kuch dushman he
 His brother is his enemy
 bahane usase naaraaz he
 Mashuka is also angry
 yani sab kuch bigadaa hua he

 or phir yuvaraj vijay kii jagah le letaa he ek aam aadmi prem
 He just makes everything right
 aksar dekha gaya he ki serial vaale filmon kii kahaniyon ko apane serials main istemaal karte hai lekin prem ratan dhan payo to kuch is tarah he jaise kisi serial kaa mahaepisod dekh rahe hai
 Nothing in the name of the story, no character is able to get into the heart and another Bajrangi appears in the form of love
 ham aapke hai koun or maine pyaar kiya jaisi trendsetting filmein banane valesooraj badjatyako kahani ke morche par thodi mehnat kerani chahie thi, or samay ke saath kadam badhanaa siikhnaa hoga

 star apilis film kaa har actor kuch extra soft hone kii koshish karata najar aata he
 From Salman to Anupam Kher
 sab bahut hi paariwarik banane kii koshish karte hai
 Salman is acting like he often does
 film main vahi ek cheez he jise dekha ja saktaa he, lekin jab contant hi kuch nahin hoga to salmaan bhi kya kar sakate hai
 The only thing that can be said about Sonam Kapoor is that she is very good in traditional costumes
 swara bhaskar ko thodaa mauka mila ve thik hai
 The director could not understand what to get Deepak Dobriyal done
 koi bhi kairactor yaad rakhane laayak nahin he
 Talking about earnings, the specialty of the films of Salman and Rajshri is his music, no matter how many songs there were boredom in the film, but except for one or two songs of Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, the rest works
 film kaa bajet lagbhag 125 karod kaa bataaya jaataa he, isliye film ko box offis par kaaphi mehnat kerani hoga
 Well, the festival is weekend, and there are many holidays and Salman
 isliye salmaan ko zyada dikkat aane vaali he nahin
 But the real benefit of this film will be Shahrukh Khan because his upcoming film is "dilwale", and Salman's name is Prem Dilwale
 
 
 dilli main bijepi ke purv rashtriya sanghathan mahaamantri sanjay joshi ke poster kaa jinn ek baar phir niklaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been targeted in the gestures through the poster
 sanjay joshi ke samarthakon ke mutabik jab pradhanmantri bangladesh or pakistan se baatcheet kar sakate hai to phir sanjay joshi se kyon nahin
 The special thing is that in the national capital Delhi, PM housing 7-RCR, BJP President Amit Shah, BJP leader LK Advani and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi have been placed close to the residence
 iske alaava kai anya jagahon par bhi sanjay joshi se jude poster lagaae gaye hai
 What is written in the poster, Sanjay Joshi has been written in the poster, 'congratulations to Pakistan and Bangladesh, congratulations on Ramadan are on the mind for Sushma, Advani, Sanjay Joshi, Rajnath, Gadkari, Murali Manohar Joshi, Vasundhara
 ' iske baad thik neeche likhaa gaya he, 'naa samvaad, naa man kii baat, naa sabakaa saath, naa sabakaa vikaas phir kyon kare janata aap par vishwaas?'hording menek ore amit shah or narendra modi kii tasviir lagaai gai he, jabaki duusari ore sanjay joshi ko poster main akele dikhaaya gaya he
 Many people are named below as Nivedak
 yah hording videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke ghar ke baahar bhi lagaae gaye hai
 This poster is not the first time that this is not the first time that Sanjay Joshi's supporters have put up such posters
 isse pehle april main france, germany or canada kii yatra se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke desh lautate hi unke ghor virdohi maane jane walebijapi netaa sanjay joshike samarthakon ne poster waar kiya tha
 These posters were then placed outside the BJP headquarters, the home of LK Advani and the party's national president Amit Shah
 un postaron or hordings main sanjay joshi kii ghar vaapasi kii maang kii gai thi
 While the controversy escalated, those posters were immediately removed
 kya likhaa tha paheleisse pehle lagaae gaye postaron or hordings par sanjay joshi kii ghar vaapasi kii maang ke saath-saath likhaa tha, ‘agar sabase hoti he man kii baat to phir suno hamaare bhi man kii baat
 It is written on the hoardings, 'why is everyone's development together, why not Sanjay Joshi's support?' team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ko kuch dinon ke liye aaraam karnaa chahie
 This is to say that of former India captain Sourav Ganguly
 saurav ganguli ne kaha he ki in dinon mahendra singh dhoni lagaataar cricket khel rahe hai or har tarah ke formet main khel rahe hai
 But now the time has come when they should take some rest
 ganguli ke mutabik austrailia daure se pehle ganguli aaraam nahin karenge to austrailia main team india kii halaat england daure jaisi ho sakati he
 As the army and police were taking to the streets of Ahmedabad to control the violence of Patel agitators, there was news of an amendment in the central list of obcs from the Modi government's cabinet meeting in Delhi that evening
 centre sarkaar ne gujarat or uttarakhand se do jatiyon ko obisi suchi main shaamil kar liya he
 Sipai and Patni Jamaat are already in the OBC list of Gujarat
 ye donon hi samudaay garib obisi jatiyaan hai
 Some are Hindus and some are Muslims
 jaise pashchim uttar pradesh main kuch rajput hindu hote hai to kuch muslim hote hai
 The Patel youth, who have been included in the OBC quota, should think that Sipai and Patni Jamaat did not rally for lakhs, yet how did they find a place in the OBC list of Gujarat and now the Center
 kya patel bhi saamaajik aarthik aadhaar par in jatiyon ke samakaksh ho sakate hai
 The problem is that we have started considering the copywriters' advertisement as iron men, but everyone should understand that they do not have the political courage to make the basis of reservation economical
 jab tak aisa nahin hota aarakshan kaa aadhaar jatigat bhedbhaav hi rahegaa or is paimaane par patel noujvaan shoshak hai yaa shoshit unhen khud sochna hoga
 Even today many castes of society are suffering this discrimination
 gujarat main hi dalit ladakiyon ke saath balaatkaar kii ghatana main 500 pratishat kii vruddhi kii hui he
 In Bihar, a Dalit was thrown into a thresher on demand of wages
 dalit duulhon ko aaj bhi ghodi chadhane nahin diya jaataa he
 i did not see that a large number of anti-reservation tweeters came out on the streets against such torture

 But there is discrimination here too
 agar unki tarah inhen sawaalon ke lekar adivasee yaa musalmaan sadakon par aa gaye hote to samaaj or raajnneeti kii pratikriya kya hoti
 The BJP Congress did not send its spokesperson TV studios on the Patel agitation, but both parties remained silent even when Muslims were demanding

 We have killed all of us by entering the house

 In business cities like Ahmedabad and Surat, the Patels have their own area telling that due to economic and political confidence they can settle in different areas

 It is right that if there was a demand for reservation in the rally of Patel youth, then it was equally loud that the reservation should be abolished
 aisi maang karne vaale dilli main bhi dikhte hai magar kisi raajnneetik dal ne unhen nahin apanaaya
 Patel will lose his political power by demanding the abolition of reservation
 obisi or dalit ek taraf aa jaaenge or phir unki maang kaa koi khulkar samarthan bhi nahin karegaa
 Are Patel youngsters ready for this risk? isi jokhim ke kaaran patel vidhayak saath nahin de rahe hai
 Nevertheless, the Patel youth should be listened to
 unki baton se wo sachai saamne aa rahi he jo aksar hindutv kii samgr pahchaan ke kaaran nazar nahin aati
 Even if other societies have the same agony, the Patel youth have taken the initiative to raise their voice
 wo agar aarakshan chhod in sawaalon par nikalate to shaayad aaj duusari sthiti hoti
 Whatever it is, the questions of unemployment and the crisis of farming are not the same among the Patel youth
 sabake hai
 Patel youth movement is as much against the Gujarat government as it is against the leadership of their society
 gujarat vidhansabha main chalis patel vidhayak hai
 The Chief Minister is also a Patel and many ministers besides him
 iske baad bhi patel naujavaanon kaa kisi ne saath nahin diya
 If the question of reservation was difficult, then expensive fees could only be reduced
 kaaphi lanbaa vakt lag jaataa he magar ant main sabko dikhne hi lagata he ki patel brahman yaa yadav ke naam par netaa bane log party ke kaam aate hai, samaaj ke nahin
 Patel youths have seen that Patel is a legislator
 gujarat main awaz to ek hi thi
 The voice, which had a hand on its head, people did not see it, seeing Narendra Modi and voted
 in bivaaz netaaon ko aap bhale chalis patel yaa sattar patel main gin lijie, lekin sabaki khamoshi bataa rahi he ki ek bhi na hote to khaas fark nahin padataa
 This is the reason that in many places the houses and offices of Patel ministers to mlas were targeted
 hinsa patel bahul ilaakon main hi hui or vahaan patel netao ke ghar or party karyaalayon main todphod kii gai
 In Unjha, the office of BJP MLA Narayan Bhai Patel was set on fire
 narayan bhai patel samaaj ke pratishthit netaa hai
 There was an attempt to burn the house of Home Minister Rajni Patel
 mehsana kii saansad jayshri ben patel ke ghar par bhi hamalaa hua
 Chief Minister Anandiben Patel had to increase the security of her residence
 gujarat sarkaar main number do maane jane vaale nitin patel ke ghar bhi bheed pahunch gai
 BJP MLA from Visnagar attacked the house
 patel vidhayakon ke saamne dikkat duusari he
 They feel that BJP has a political future in Gujarat and BJP itself
 hindutv kii raajnneeti ne unhen band raste tak pahunchaa diya he
 Now they want to maintain their position in this party
 isliye chup hai
 They are not coming forward, but there is growing anxiety among lower level Patel leaders
 kuch jagahon se parshadon yaa panchayat sadasyon ke istipha dene kii khabaren ain hai
 Some Patel members of Jasdan Taluka Panchayat near Rajkot have resigned
 bijepi kisaan morcha ke upaadhyaksh bechar bhaadaani ne pad se istipha de diya he
 They have started supporting the demand of Patel youth
 is bich, gujarat jaise chote rajya main 125 se zyada privet ejineering college khul gaye
 Most of the institutes belong to the Patel people
 in collejon main 60,000 se zyada siten hai
 According to the report of Indian Express, not a single seat is vacant this year in six government engineering colleges, but in private colleges, more than 22,000 seats remained vacant even after the eligibility rules were relaxed
 gujarat vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati ne indian express se kaha he ki swaposhit collejon kii fees itani mahangi ho gai he ki vah bhi ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 The Amir Patels opened school colleges by taking advantage of the power on the strength of the society, but by increasing the fees, they put the burden of debt on the boys of their own society
 nateeja patel naujavaanon ne karz lekar fees bharani shuru kii yaa phir fees bharte bharte karz main chale gaye
 The same situation may have happened for other societies too, but perhaps they will not have the same confidence as the Patels that they can ring the bell of the Gujarat government
 jo ejeeniyar banakar nikle unka samaadhaan naukari paakar bhi nahin hua
 Some remained unemployed and some received extremely low salaries
 ab iskaa samaadhaan to aarakshan se nahin hoga
 Even after reservation, this problem will remain
 fasebuk par kisi ne likhaa he ki may 2015 main rajasthan main chaparasi ke pad ke liye 143 bhartiyon nikali thim
 77000 applications came before the Department of Agriculture
 yahi hakeekat bihar upi yaa kisi bhi rajya kii he
 The unemployed are boiling but cannot find a way
 hindu muslim kii aag main kud to jate hai magar hindu hokar bhi naukari nahin milti
 Politics finds new ways to escape and people find a way out in the dark of night
 tippaniyan This was the reason that a large number of women also came out in the mohallas of Ahmedabad on the night before the 25 August rally
 ye auraten apane beton kii takalif jaanati hai
 If bjp's Hindutva politics had not given Patel confidence or protection, Patel would have remained silent
 isliye nae or puraane patelon ke bich sangharsh kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 If the Patel youth remains adamant on the question of reservation, then it is bound to disappear
 agar inke sawaal naukari or shiksha ke nijeekaran or fasalon ke behatar mulya main badalte hai to ye bahut kuch hasil kar sakate hai
 For myself as well as for others
 yogendra yadav ne thik hi kaha he, sab bachane kaa rasta khoj rahe hai
 Reservation is not the easy answer
 agar kisi ko lagata he ki aarakshan khatm hone kaa vakt aa gaya he to ek sawaal pradhanmantri narendra modi or congress netaa rahul gandhi se puch lijie
 i will answer them now
 ham maanate hai ki aarakshan zaruri he or isamen koi badlaav nahin hoga
 The debate will start only when these leaders take the initiative
 varna kisi bahes kii manyata nahin hogi
 Their test of honesty is also that they should at least show initiative on the question of giving reservation to poor upper castes on economic basis
 is par sabaki sahmati he
 The Patel youth, who have been included in the OBC quota, should think that Sipai and Patni Jamaat did not rally for lakhs, yet how did they find a place in the OBC list of Gujarat and now the Center
 kya patel bhi saamaajik aarthik aadhaar par in jatiyon ke samakaksh ho sakate hai
 The problem is that we have started considering the copywriters' advertisement as iron men, but everyone should understand that they do not have the political courage to make the basis of reservation economical
 jab tak aisa nahin hota aarakshan kaa aadhaar jatigat bhedbhaav hi rahegaa or is paimaane par patel noujvaan shoshak hai yaa shoshit unhen khud sochna hoga
 Even today many castes of society are suffering this discrimination
 gujarat main hi dalit ladakiyon ke saath balaatkaar kii ghatana main 500 pratishat kii vruddhi kii hui he
 In Bihar, a Dalit was thrown into a thresher on demand of wages
 dalit duulhon ko aaj bhi ghodi chadhane nahin diya jaataa he
 i did not see that a large number of anti-reservation tweeters came out on the streets against such torture
 in sawaalon ke saamne aate hi sab chup ho jate hai
 In every society, there are some rich and mostly poor
 patel samaaj ke logon ne apni haadtod mehnat se kamyaabi kii kai bemisaal kahaniyaan gadhi hai

 We have killed all of us by entering the house
 media bhi kehane laga ki patel bahul ilaakon se hinsa or takaraav kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 In business cities like Ahmedabad and Surat, the Patels have their own area telling that due to economic and political confidence they can settle in different areas
 yahi vajah he ki unki amiri or awaz donon dikhaai or sunai detii he, lekin aisa kya ho gaya ki jo samaaj apane apartment ke bagalvaala flats kisi dalit or obisi ke saath saajha nahin kar saktaa vah obisi suchi main inke naamon ke saath khud ko dekhnaa chahta he
 It is right that if there was a demand for reservation in the rally of Patel youth, then it was equally loud that the reservation should be abolished
 aisi maang karne vaale dilli main bhi dikhte hai magar kisi raajnneetik dal ne unhen nahin apanaaya
 Patel will lose his political power by demanding the abolition of reservation
 obisi or dalit ek taraf aa jaaenge or phir unki maang kaa koi khulkar samarthan bhi nahin karegaa
 Are Patel youngsters ready for this risk? isi jokhim ke kaaran patel vidhayak saath nahin de rahe hai
 Nevertheless, the Patel youth should be listened to
 unki baton se wo sachai saamne aa rahi he jo aksar hindutv kii samgr pahchaan ke kaaran nazar nahin aati
 Even if other societies have the same agony, the Patel youth have taken the initiative to raise their voice
 wo agar aarakshan chhod in sawaalon par nikalate to shaayad aaj duusari sthiti hoti
 Whatever it is, the questions of unemployment and the crisis of farming are not the same among the Patel youth
 sabake hai
 Patel youth movement is as much against the Gujarat government as it is against the leadership of their society
 gujarat vidhansabha main chalis patel vidhayak hai
 The Chief Minister is also a Patel and many ministers besides him
 iske baad bhi patel naujavaanon kaa kisi ne saath nahin diya
 If the question of reservation was difficult, then expensive fees could only be reduced
 kaaphi lanbaa vakt lag jaataa he magar ant main sabko dikhne hi lagata he ki patel brahman yaa yadav ke naam par netaa bane log party ke kaam aate hai, samaaj ke nahin
 Patel youths have seen that Patel is a legislator
 gujarat main awaz to ek hi thi
 The voice, which had a hand on its head, people did not see it, seeing Narendra Modi and voted
 in bivaaz netaaon ko aap bhale chalis patel yaa sattar patel main gin lijie, lekin sabaki khamoshi bataa rahi he ki ek bhi na hote to khaas fark nahin padataa
 This is the reason that in many places the houses and offices of Patel ministers to mlas were targeted
 hinsa patel bahul ilaakon main hi hui or vahaan patel netao ke ghar or party karyaalayon main todphod kii gai
 In Unjha, the office of BJP MLA Narayan Bhai Patel was set on fire
 narayan bhai patel samaaj ke pratishthit netaa hai
 There was an attempt to burn the house of Home Minister Rajni Patel
 mehsana kii saansad jayshri ben patel ke ghar par bhi hamalaa hua
 Chief Minister Anandiben Patel had to increase the security of her residence
 gujarat sarkaar main number do maane jane vaale nitin patel ke ghar bhi bheed pahunch gai
 BJP MLA from Visnagar attacked the house
 patel vidhayakon ke saamne dikkat duusari he
 They feel that BJP has a political future in Gujarat and BJP itself
 hindutv kii raajnneeti ne unhen band raste tak pahunchaa diya he
 Now they want to maintain their position in this party
 isliye chup hai
 They are not coming forward, but there is growing anxiety among lower level Patel leaders
 kuch jagahon se parshadon yaa panchayat sadasyon ke istipha dene kii khabaren ain hai
 Some Patel members of Jasdan Taluka Panchayat near Rajkot have resigned
 bijepi kisaan morcha ke upaadhyaksh bechar bhaadaani ne pad se istipha de diya he
 They have started supporting the demand of Patel youth
 is bich, gujarat jaise chote rajya main 125 se zyada privet ejineering college khul gaye
 Most of the institutes belong to the Patel people
 in collejon main 60,000 se zyada siten hai
 According to the report of the Indian Express, not a single seat is vacant this year in six government engineering colleges, but more than 22,000 seats were left vacant even after the eligibility rules were relaxed in private colleges
 gujarat vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati ne indian express se kaha he ki swaposhit collejon kii fees itani mahangi ho gai he ki vah bhi ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 The Amir Patels opened school colleges by taking advantage of the power on the strength of the society, but by increasing the fees, they put the burden of debt on the boys of their own society
 nateeja patel naujavaanon ne karz lekar fees bharani shuru kii yaa phir fees bharte bharte karz main chale gaye
 The same situation may have happened for other societies too, but perhaps they will not have the same confidence as the Patels that they can ring the bell of the Gujarat government
 jo ejeeniyar banakar nikle unka samaadhaan naukari paakar bhi nahin hua
 Some remained unemployed and some received extremely low salaries
 ab iskaa samaadhaan to aarakshan se nahin hoga
 Even after reservation, this problem will remain
 fasebuk par kisi ne likhaa he ki may 2015 main rajasthan main chaparasi ke pad ke liye 143 bhartiyon nikali thim
 77000 applications came before the Department of Agriculture
 yahi hakeekat bihar upi yaa kisi bhi rajya kii he
 The unemployed are boiling but cannot find a way
 hindu muslim kii aag main kud to jate hai magar hindu hokar bhi naukari nahin milti
 Politics finds new ways to escape and people find a way out in the dark of night
 tippaniyan This was the reason that a large number of women also came out in the mohallas of Ahmedabad on the night before the 25 August rally
 ye auraten apane beton kii takalif jaanati hai
 If bjp's Hindutva politics had not given Patel confidence or protection, Patel would have remained silent
 isliye nae or puraane patelon ke bich sangharsh kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 If the Patel youth remains adamant on the question of reservation, then it is bound to disappear
 agar inke sawaal naukari or shiksha ke nijeekaran or fasalon ke behatar mulya main badalte hai to ye bahut kuch hasil kar sakate hai
 For myself as well as for others
 yogendra yadav ne thik hi kaha he, sab bachane kaa rasta khoj rahe hai
 Reservation is not the easy answer
 agar kisi ko lagata he ki aarakshan khatm hone kaa vakt aa gaya he to ek sawaal pradhanmantri narendra modi or congress netaa rahul gandhi se puch lijie
 i will answer them now
 ham maanate hai ki aarakshan zaruri he or isamen koi badlaav nahin hoga
 The debate will start only when these leaders take the initiative
 varna kisi bahes kii manyata nahin hogi
 Their test of honesty is also that they should at least show initiative on the question of giving reservation to poor upper castes on economic basis
 is par sabaki sahmati he
 Whatever the Patels' economic strength and eighteen per cent share in the population has made them politically influential in Gujarat
 rajya ke tamaam sansadhano par is samaaj ke logon kaa prabhaav he
 Despite this, if the Patel youth is shouting and shouting, see his poverty
 berojgaare dekhiye to main samajhataa hum ki uski awaz sahanubhuti se suni jaani chahie
 But there is discrimination here too
 agar unki tarah inhen sawaalon ke lekar adivasee yaa musalmaan sadakon par aa gaye hote to samaaj or raajnneeti kii pratikriya kya hoti
 The BJP Congress did not send its spokesperson TV studios on the Patel agitation, but both parties remained silent even when Muslims were demanding
 khud patel bhi maanate hai ki gujarat kii anya jatiyon se saamaajik bhedbhaav karne ke jo aarope lagate hai, usamen sachai he
 Find out the details of the violence or areas in Ahmedabad, Surat and Mehsana
 musalamaanon kii basti kii baat to sab kehete hai, lekin ahmedabad or surat main patel bahul ilaake kisi ko nazar nahin aate
 The process of formation of Patel dominated areas should also be considered
 kaise ho gaya ki patel bahul ilaakon ke apartment main daliton ko pravesh nahin mila
 OBC castes also got only admission
 kai patel yuvaaon ne kaha ki isamen badlaav aa rahaa he
 But the police also know Bapunagar of Ahmedabad as a Patel-dominated area

 Their test of honesty is also that they should at least show initiative on the question of giving reservation to poor upper castes on economic basis
 is par sabaki sahmati he
 Patel himself also believes that there is truth in the allegations of social discrimination against other castes of Gujarat
 ahmedabad, surat or mehsana ke jin mohallon yaa ilaakon main hinsa hui he, unki detail nikaaliye
 Everyone says about the settlement of Muslims, but no one can see the Patel dominated areas in Ahmedabad and Surat
 patel bahul ilaake ke banane kii prakriya par bhi vichaar karnaa chahie
 How did it happen that Dalits did not get entry into apartments in Patel dominated areas
 obisi jatiyon ko bhi naam maatr hi pravesh mila
 Many Patel youth said that it is changing
 lekin police bhi ahmedabad ke bapunagar ko patel bahul ilaake ke rup main jaanati he
 a woman from Matruchaya Sosoyati told our colleague Rajeev Pathak that the police came inside
 ghar main ghuskar ham sabko maaraa he
 The media also said that there were reports of violence and confrontation from Patel-dominated areas
 ahmedabad or surat jaise kaarobaari shaharon main patelon kaa apana ilaaka bataa rahaa he ki aarthik or raajnneetik aatmavishvaas ke kaaran ve alag ilaaka basaa sakate hai
 This is the reason why both his richness and his voice are seen and heard, but what has happened is that the society which cannot share the flat next to his apartment with any Dalit and OBC wants to see himself with their names in the OBC list
 is
 thik he ki patel naujavaanon kii raily main aarakshan kii maang hui to yah bhi utane hi zordaar tareeke se kaha gaya ki aarakshan samaapt kar diya jaae
 Such demands are seen in Delhi but no political party has adopted them
 aarakshan mitaane kii maang kar patel apni raajnneetik takat kho denge
 obcs and Dalits will come together and then no one will openly support their demand
 kya patel noujvaan is jokhim ke liye taiyaar hai
 Due to this risk, Patel is not supporting the MLA
 phir bhi patel naujavaanon kii baat suni jaani chahie
 His truth is coming out from his words which is often not seen due to the overall identity of Hindutva
 bhale hi duusare samaaj kii bhi yahi vyathaa ho magar patel naujavaanon ne awaz uthaane kii pahal to kii hi he
 If he left the reservation and would have gone on these questions, then today probably would have been another situation
 jo bhi he berojgaare or kheti ke sankat ke sawaal patel naujavaanon ke hi nahin hai
 Belongs to everyone
 patel naujavaanon kaa andolan jitna gujarat sarkaar ke khilaaf he utana hi apane samaaj ke netritv ke khilaaf bhi
 There are forty Patel mlas in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly
 mukhyamantri bhi patel hai or unke alaava kai mantri bhi
 Even after this, no one supported the Patel youth
 aarakshan kaa sawaal mushkil tha to mahangi fees to kam kii hi ja sakati thi
 It takes a long time, but in the end everyone starts to see that people who become leaders in the name of Patel Brahmin or Yadav are useful to the party and not to the society
 patel naujavaanon ko yah dikh gaya he ki patel vidhayak naam ke hi hai
 The voice was the same in Gujarat
 us awaz ne jiske sir par haath rakhaa logon ne use nahin dekha, narendra modi ko dekhakar vot de diya
 You may count these voiceless leaders as forty patels or seventy patels, but everyone's silence is telling that if there is not one, it does not matter much
 yahi kaaran he ki kai jagahon par patel mantriyon se lekar vidhayakon ke ghar or karyaalayon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Violence took place in Patel-dominated areas and the houses and party offices of Patel leaders were vandalized there
 oonja main bijepi vidhayak narayan bhai patel ke daftar main aag laga di gai
 Narayan Bhai Patel is an eminent leader of the society
 grahamantri rajani patel ke ghar ko jalaane kaa prayaas hua
 Mehsana MP Jayashree Ben Patel's house was also attacked
 mukhyamantri anandiben patel ko apane nivas kii suraksha badhaani padi
 The house of Nitin Patel, considered number two in the Gujarat government, also got crowded
 visanagar ke bijepi ke vidhayak ke ghar hamalaa hua
 The problem is second to Patel mlas
 unhen lagata he ki gujarat main bijepi kaa or bijepi main hi unka raajnneetik bhavishya he
 The politics of Hindutva has led him to a closed path
 ab ve is party main apni sthiti banaae rakhana chaahate hai
 Therefore silent
 saamne nahin aa rahe hai, lekin nichle str ke patel netaaon main bechaini bad rahi he
 There have been reports of councilors or panchayat members resigning from some places
 rajkot ke paas jasdan taluka panchayat ke kuch patel sadasyon ne istipha diya he
 Bechar Bhadani, vice-president of BJP Kisan Morcha, has resigned from the post
 ve patel naujavaanon kii maang kaa samarthan karne lage hai
 Meanwhile, more than 125 private engineering colleges opened in a small state like Gujarat
 zyaadaatar santhaan patel logon ke hi hai
 These colleges have more than 60,000 seats
 indian express kii report ke anusaar chah sarkari ejineering kalejon main is saal ek bhi seat khaali nahin he, lekin privet kalejon main yogyata niyamon main dheel dene ke baad bhi 22,000 se adhik siten khaali rah gayi
 The vice-chancellor of Gujarat University has told the Indian Express that the fees of self-financed colleges have become so expensive that that too could be a reason
 amir patelon ne samaaj kii sankhya ke dam par satta se laabh lekar skool kalege to khol liye magar fees badha kar apane hi samaaj ke ladakon par karze kaa boj daal diya
 As a result, the Patel youth started paying fees on the loan or they went on paying the fees
 yahi haal duusare samaaj kaa bhi hua hoga magar shaayad unke bich patelon jaisaa aatmavishvaas nahin hoga ki ve gujarat sarkaar kii ghanti baja sakate hai
 Those who turned out to be engineers were not resolved even after getting jobs
 kuch berojgaar rah gaye or kuch ko mili behad kam tankhwaah
 Now this will not be solved by reservation
 aarakshan ke baad bhi ye samasya rahegi
 Someone wrote on Facebook that in May 2015, there were 143 recruitments for the post of peon in Rajasthan
 krishi vibhaag ke saamne 77000 aavedan aa gaye
 This is the reality of Bihar UP or any state
 berojgaar ubal rahe hai magar rasta nahin mil rahaa
 Hindus jump into Muslim fire but do not get a job even after being Hindu
 raajnneeti bachane ke nae-nae raste khoj leti he or log raat andhere main rasta khojane lagate hai
 The comments yahi kaaran tha ki 25 agast kii raily se pehle kii raat ahmedabad ke mohallon main badi sankhya main auraten bhi nikal kar ain
 These women know the suffering of their sons
 agar bijepi kii hindutv raajnneeti ne patelon ko aatmavishvaas yaa sangrakshan nahin diya hota to patel bhi chup hi rah jate
 Therefore a situation of conflict arose between the new and old Patels
 patel naujavaanon agar aarakshan ke sawaal par ade rahe to iskaa mit janaa tay he
 If their questions turn into privatization of jobs and education and better prices of crops, they can achieve a lot
 apane liye bhi or dusron ke liye bhi
 Yogendra Yadav has rightly said, everybody is looking for a way to escape
 aarakshan aasaan jawaab nahin he
 If anyone feels that the time has come for the reservation to end, then ask a question to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi
 unka jawaab abhi bataa detaa hum
 We believe that reservations are necessary and there will be no change
 bahes to tabhi shuru hogi jab ye netaa pahal karenge
 Otherwise no debate will be recognized
 inaki eemaandaaree kaa imtihaan ye bhi he ki aarthik aadhaar par garib savarnon ke aarakshan dene ke sawaal par kam se kam pahal to karke dikhaaen
 Everyone agrees on this

 thik he ki patel naujavaanon kii raily main aarakshan kii maang hui to yah bhi utane hi zordaar tareeke se kaha gaya ki aarakshan samaapt kar diya jaae
 Such demands are seen in Delhi but no political party has adopted them
 aarakshan mitaane kii maang kar patel apni raajnneetik takat kho denge
 obcs and Dalits will come together and then no one will openly support their demand
 kya patel noujvaan is jokhim ke liye taiyaar hai
 Due to this risk, Patel is not supporting the MLA
 phir bhi patel naujavaanon kii baat suni jaani chahie
 His truth is coming out from his words which is often not seen due to the overall identity of Hindutva
 bhale hi duusare samaaj kii bhi yahi vyathaa ho magar patel naujavaanon ne awaz uthaane kii pahal to kii hi he
 If he left the reservation and would have gone on these questions, then today probably would have been another situation
 jo bhi he berojgaare or kheti ke sankat ke sawaal patel naujavaanon ke hi nahin hai
 Belongs to everyone
 patel naujavaanon kaa andolan jitna gujarat sarkaar ke khilaaf he utana hi apane samaaj ke netritv ke khilaaf bhi
 There are forty Patel mlas in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly
 mukhyamantri bhi patel hai or unke alaava kai mantri bhi
 Even after this, no one supported the Patel youth
 aarakshan kaa sawaal mushkil tha to mahangi fees to kam kii hi ja sakati thi
 It takes a long time, but in the end everyone starts to see that people who become leaders in the name of Patel Brahmin or Yadav are useful to the party and not to the society
 patel naujavaanon ko yah dikh gaya he ki patel vidhayak naam ke hi hai
 The voice was the same in Gujarat
 us awaz ne jiske sir par haath rakhaa logon ne use nahin dekha, narendra modi ko dekhakar vot de diya
 You may count these voiceless leaders as forty patels or seventy patels, but everyone's silence is telling that if there is not one, it does not matter much
 yahi kaaran he ki kai jagahon par patel mantriyon se lekar vidhayakon ke ghar or karyaalayon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Violence took place in Patel-dominated areas and the houses and party offices of Patel leaders were vandalized there
 oonja main bijepi vidhayak narayan bhai patel ke daftar main aag laga di gai
 Narayan Bhai Patel is an eminent leader of the society
 grahamantri rajani patel ke ghar ko jalaane kaa prayaas hua
 Mehsana MP Jayashree Ben Patel's house was also attacked
 mukhyamantri anandiben patel ko apane nivas kii suraksha badhaani padi
 The house of Nitin Patel, considered number two in the Gujarat government, also got crowded
 visanagar ke bijepi ke vidhayak ke ghar hamalaa hua
 The problem is second to Patel mlas
 unhen lagata he ki gujarat main bijepi kaa or bijepi main hi unka raajnneetik bhavishya he
 The politics of Hindutva has led him to a closed path

 As a result, the Patel youth started paying fees on the loan or they went on paying the fees
 yahi haal duusare samaaj kaa bhi hua hoga magar shaayad unke bich patelon jaisaa aatmavishvaas nahin hoga ki ve gujarat sarkaar kii ghanti baja sakate hai
 Those who turned out to be engineers were not resolved even after getting jobs

 is bich, gujarat jaise chote rajya main 125 se zyada privet ejineering college khul gaye
 Most of the institutes belong to the Patel people
 in collejon main 60,000 se zyada siten hai
 According to the report of Indian Express, not a single seat is vacant this year in six government engineering colleges, but in private colleges, more than 22,000 seats remained vacant even after the eligibility rules were relaxed
 gujarat vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati ne indian express se kaha he ki swaposhit collejon kii fees itani mahangi ho gai he ki vah bhi ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 The Amir Patels opened school colleges by taking advantage of the power on the strength of the society, but by increasing the fees, they put the burden of debt on the boys of their own society
 nateeja patel naujavaanon ne karz lekar fees bharani shuru kii yaa phir fees bharte bharte karz main chale gaye
 The same situation may have happened for other societies too, but perhaps they will not have the same confidence as the Patels that they can ring the bell of the Gujarat government
 jo ejeeniyar banakar nikle unka samaadhaan naukari paakar bhi nahin hua
 Some remained unemployed and some received extremely low salaries
 ab iskaa samaadhaan to aarakshan se nahin hoga
 Even after reservation, this problem will remain
 fasebuk par kisi ne likhaa he ki may 2015 main rajasthan main chaparasi ke pad ke liye 143 bhartiyon nikali thim
 77000 applications came before the Department of Agriculture
 yahi hakeekat bihar upi yaa kisi bhi rajya kii he
 The unemployed are boiling but cannot find a way
 hindu muslim kii aag main kud to jate hai magar hindu hokar bhi naukari nahin milti
 Politics finds new ways to escape and people find a way out in the dark of night
 tippaniyan This was the reason that a large number of women also came out in the mohallas of Ahmedabad on the night before the 25 August rally
 ye auraten apane beton kii takalif jaanati hai
 If bjp's Hindutva politics had not given Patel confidence or protection, Patel would have remained silent
 isliye nae or puraane patelon ke bich sangharsh kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 If the Patel youth remains adamant on the question of reservation, then it is bound to disappear
 agar inke sawaal naukari or shiksha ke nijeekaran or fasalon ke behatar mulya main badalte hai to ye bahut kuch hasil kar sakate hai
 For myself as well as for others

 Reservation is not the easy answer

 ham maanate hai ki aarakshan zaruri he or isamen koi badlaav nahin hoga
 The debate will start only when these leaders take the initiative

 Their test of honesty is also that they should at least show initiative on the question of giving reservation to poor upper castes on economic basis

 The Amir Patels opened school colleges by taking advantage of the power on the strength of the society, but by increasing the fees, they put the burden of debt on the boys of their own society
 nateeja patel naujavaanon ne karz lekar fees bharani shuru kii yaa phir fees bharte bharte karz main chale gaye
 The same situation may have happened for other societies too, but perhaps they will not have the same confidence as the Patels that they can ring the bell of the Gujarat government
 jo ejeeniyar banakar nikle unka samaadhaan naukari paakar bhi nahin hua
 Some remained unemployed and some received extremely low salaries
 ab iskaa samaadhaan to aarakshan se nahin hoga
 Even after reservation, this problem will remain

 If bjp's Hindutva politics had not given Patel confidence or protection, Patel would have remained silent

 Those who turned out to be engineers were not resolved even after getting jobs

 Now this will not be solved by reservation

 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) President and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati said on Monday that the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have entered into an internal settlement, while the Congress is out of the race
 bareli main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue mayawati ne kaha, "bhaajapa ke ek saansad ne kal ek bayaan diya tha ki sapa sabase adhik siten jeetne ja rahi he

 Opposition parties are unanimously opposing the proposal of division of the state because they do not want to see the state develop
 mayawati ne kaha ki janata ko sabase adhik congress se saavdhaan rahanaa he kyonki vah paanch saal main vikaas kaa daawa kar rahi he lekin yah daawa puri tarah se jhootha hi he
 If the Congress could not overcome poverty in its 40 years of rule after independence, what will it do in five years
 tippaniyan Earlier, addressing a public meeting in Badaun, Mayawati appealed to the voters to vote in large numbers to keep the BJP and SP away from power
 bhaajapa satta main ai to sampradayik takatein majboot hongi or sapa satta main ai to gundaraj kaayam hoga
 He said that the BSP government had inherited corruption and Gundaraj but the BSP government established the rule of law

 congress aazaadee ke baad yadi 40 varsh ke apane shasankaal main garibi ko dur nahin kar saki to ab paanch saal main kya kar legi

 unhone kaha ki basapa kii sarkaar ko bhrashtachar evam gundaraj viraasat main mila tha lekin basapa kii sarkaar ne kanoon kaa raaj sthapit kiya
 He said that it was only due to wrong economic policies of the Center that people migrated from the state
 congress paanch saal ke bheetar soobe kaa vikaas karne kaa daawa kar rahi he lekin apane shasankaal ke dauraan usne bhrashtachar failaane ke alaava kuch nahin mila
 Mayawati said, "the BSP government, saddened by the attitude of the central government, developed Uttar Pradesh on the basis of its own limited resources

 London-based Amnesty International released photographs showing us-built Tomahawk missiles and cluster bombs indicating that these explosives were used in an attack on 17 December 2009 in Yemen's southern Abayan province

 This remark of a separate resolution passed on education at the annual representative meeting of the RSS held in Nagaur, Rajasthan on March 11-13, left a relaxed smile on the face of a 68-year-old Khanty Swayamsevak of the Sangh who was educated in that state
 Is a minister
 unhone na kisi aalochana kii parvaah kii or na hi apano kii aapattiyon kii chintaa, anushaasit swayamsevak kii bhaanti aage badhate gaye, jise vipaksh ne 'shiksha kaa bhagavakaran' qaraar diya
 But Vasudev Devnani, Education Minister of the Vasundhara Raje government of Rajasthan, does not seem to be distracted by these allegations, "saffron is also in our tricolor
 bhagava tyaag or samarpan kaa pratik he
 If the new syllabus creates a sense of nationalism as well as spiritual affiliation, then someone calls it saffronization or something, it does not matter
 devnani kii is aatmavishvaas kii vajah bhi he
 When Vasundhara Raje became the Chief Minister after the historic victory in Rajasthan in December 2013, Devnani was not part of that government
 lekin aktubar 2014 main unhen mantrimandal main shaamil kiya gaya or cabinet mantri kaalicharan sarraf se skool shiksha (praathmik-madhyamik) vibhaag lekar swatantra prabhaar ke rup main unhen saunpa gaya
 After this, according to the agenda of the Sangh, the script of the change in the curriculum of Rajasthan was written
 kaise or kya hua he badlavdevnani ke mantri banane ke baad shuruaati hafton main hi unki sangh ke shiksha kshetra se jude sabhi sanghathanon ke saath vistrut charchaa hui
 According to sources, three points came up in these meetings with representatives of Vidya Bharati, Shikshan Mandal, Shiksha Bachao, Teachers Association and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad
 ek, rajasthan or desh ke vir-viranganaon ko paathyakram main shaamil karnaa, duusare, paathya-saamagree aisi ho jisase bhartiya samskruti par garv kii anubhuti ho or tisare, chaatr deshbhakt or shreshth naagarik bane
 Changes in the middle of the teaching session were not possible, so lessons from great men like Maharana Pratap, Govind Guru and Subhash Chandra Bose were added through the supplementary syllabus
 uske baad mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke nirdesh par tay kiya gaya ki pehali se paanchavin kaksha tak 75 fisadi rajasthan ke bare main to 25 fisadi bharat ke bare main padhaayaa jayega to chhathi se aathvin tak 50-50 fisadi or 9veen kaksha se vishwa ke bare main padhaayaa jayega
 Devanani took a step towards complete change and took the initiative to rewrite the syllabus by constituting a committee
 ab 2016 se sabhi paathyakram badale ja chuke hai
 Most of the controversies should be added to the great men and before the course, Prime Minister Pt
 jawaharlal nehru se jude kuch anshon main kaat-chhaant ko lekar he
 There was a picture of Nehru in the text of the unification of states, but now Sardar Patel is engaged
 devnani kaa kahana he ki pehle itihaas ek vishesh parivaar tak simata tha, lekin ab bose, tilak, patel, ambedkar vagairah ko bhi joda gaya he
 The course includes the Kashmir Movement of Jana Sangh founder Shyamaprasad Mukherjee, Pt
 dinadayal upaadhyaay ke ekatm maanav darshan, purv sarasanghachaalak ke
 s
 sudarshan kii paryaavaran par kavita, bijepi netaa menka gandhi, nanaaji deshmukh, vir saavarkar jaise sidhe sangh se jude hue naam shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Apart from this, there are many names in the syllabus which the Sangh considers as its ideal
 inamen bhaskaracharya, aryabhatta sangh ke praatah smaraneey paath kaa hissaa hai to vidya bharti or shikshan mandal ke anurodh par panna dhai ko vishesh mahatv ke saath joda gaya
 But the poem with Rani Laxmibai taught in class seven has also been removed
 haalanki devnani ab ise supplementry ke taur par jodgaye kii baat karte hai
 In the poem, there are lines like leaving the capital, describing Scindia as a friend of the British
 kaha ja rahaa he ki isi vajah se kavita hataai gai
 In the course, Akbar is no longer a great Mughal ruler, but instead Maharana Pratap has been described as great
 paathyakram main sabhi pradhanmantri shaamil hai
 But the BJP leader and former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the current PM Narendra Modi (both have a total of 8 years term) have been given a space of around 9 paragraphs, while Manmohan Singh, who was PM for 10 years, has been included in just one paragraph
 devnani ne sabhi model skulon kaa namakaran swami vivekanand ke naam par kiya
 In the syllabus, awards to Bhagwad Gita, Yoga, Vande Mataram, Surya Namaskar, Saraswati Pujan on Vasant Panchami and toppers students are also named after Sangh's ideal Eklavya and Meera
 dilachasp yah he ki sthaneey str par gathit vidhyalay vikaas samiti (esadisi) kii baithak ke liye amavasya tithi nirdhaarit kii gai he
 When the Union of Social Harmony started two new projects on social harmony and environment, Devnani also pushed forward this agenda in Rajasthan
 paathyakram main rajya kii sabhi pramukh jatiyon ke saamaajik netaaon-guruon ko jagah di gai he, jo rajnatik lihaaj se mufeed bhi hai
 To entice the Gujjar community, Lord Devnarayan, Maharaja Suraj Mal from Jat, Maharana Pratap from Rajput, Veer Durgadas Rathore, Prithviraj Chauhan, Mahavir Swami from Jain, Acharya Tulsi, Bhanbhoji Maharaj from Vishnoi, Guru Jambeshwar, Govind Guru from Adivasi, Chanakya from Brahmin , Hemu Kalani from Sindhi, Maharaja Daharsen, Mali Samaj Sejotiba Phule have been added to the syllabus
 vipaksh aakraamakashiksha main badlaav ko lekar congress-vampanthi sanghathanon ke alaava buddhijivi bhi bijepi ke khilaaf mukhar ho rahe hai
 But Devnani says that the Congress had removed the text of the nationalists under his rule
 mukherjee, upaadhyaay, saavarkar ke paath faad die the
 The rama-lakshmana dialogue was removed until the Kumbh Mela
 lekin unki sarkaar ne kisi mahapurush ko hataaya nahin, balki joda he
 On the controversy over Nehru, he says that he is mentioned in 15 places, but adding other great men will reduce the text share
 lekin india today se baatcheet main purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kehete hai, ''hamane sampradayikta failaane ke liye nahin, balki sadbhaav ke liye badlaav kiya tha
 But the whole country is worried about what BJP is doing
 bijepi ne rajeev seva centre kaa naam badalakar atal seva centre kar diya, lekin ham shashan main aaenge to atal kaa naam nahin hataayenge balki naam rajeev gandhi atal seva centre kar denge
 There is a big difference between their thinking and our thinking
 ''pratishthit saamaajik kaaryakarta aruna raay shiksha ke maujuuda badlaav ko pashchgaami kadam bataati hai
 She says, "the change in textbooks every two to four years is also a scam because it gives a big benefit to the publisher-distributor
 shiksha ke maamle main kisi bhi sarkaar ko rajnatik lihaaj se manamaani nahin kerani chahie, balki is maamle main rajnatik vichaar se dur jane-maane shiksha shastriyon kii team banaakar paathyakram tay karnaa chahie
 Along with the agenda, modernities are also claiming to remove the flaws of the Devanani system apart from the agenda of the federation
 tabadale main online counselling, shaala darpan or shaala darshan naam se portal banaakar chaatr-shikshak kaa puraa byora, har panchayat main utkrisht vidhyalay, adarsh vidhyalay kii pahal kar board ke nateezon ko sudhara he
 With these efforts, on the one hand, the Devanani are emerging as saffron faces by openly advocating the Union agenda on the other side
 dalit netaa or gujarat ke vadgam se nirdaleey vidhayak jignesh mewaani kaa kahana he ki bhima-koregaanv hinsa ke maamle main ek aaropee ke ghar se mili patr ke jariye ambedkarwaad andolan par naklite kaa thappa lagane kii sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 Mevani said that the lettermila is useless

 But the question is who can kill Modi, his chest is 56 inches

 Modi comes out with a 56-inch chest, so where is he to be scared
 phir bhi unhen dar lag rahaa he to hamaari naseehat he ki wo himalay chale jaaen
 Jinnesh Mevani, a Dalit leader and independent MLA from Gujarat, over the attack on the brother of Dr Kafeel Khan in Gorakhpur, says that the governments of all the states spend crores of rupees at the expense of Fijool
 upi sarkaar kii ore se mahaj 60 lakh rupee nahin die jane kii vajah se gorakhpur ke sarkari aspataal main kai bacchon kii maut ho gai thi, us vakt doctor kapheel khan hi the jinke prayaas se kai bacchon kii jaan bhi bachi
 Instead of being credited, he was sued
 jab wo jail se nikalakar baahar aae to unhone kaha tha ki unhen ashanka he ki un par yaa unke parivaar par hamalaa ho saktaa he
 If his brother was attacked yesterday, some conspiracy seems to be behind it too
 haalanki upi police ne is maamle main exiaar darj kar liya he, lekin jignesh kaa kahana he ki jaan se maarane kaa prayaas kiya gaya he, vaise to exiaar honi hi he, lekin is hamale ke peeche ke makasad kii jaanch bhi honi chahie

 This year the pictures of the huge crowd waiting to reach the summit and the news of the death of the climbers in the absence of bottled oxygen shocked everyone
 aamtaur par har saal chand parvatarohiyon or unka saamaan dhone vaale sherpaon kii everest par hui maut kii khabaren aati rahati hai, par unhen tavajjo nahin di jaati
 But when a famous person passes or a large number of people die, the incident becomes a newspaper headline
 kisi bhi parvatarohi ke liye everest kaa durgam rasta or behad mushkil chadhaai, kam oxigen vaali hawa, barf dhaki tikhi chadhaai, pal-pal rup badalata ghanghor mausam, himaskhalan or chattaanon ke girane kaa khatra, glacier ke tukdon kaa girnaa or khatarnaak daraaren hi sabase bada aakarshan hoti hai

 yah sabase pehle yuar ananthamurti ne kaha tha ki 2014 main agar narendra modi satta main aa gaye to ve desh chhod denge
 After this, UR Ananthamurthy was criticized a lot
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki ve desh chhodane kii baat kyon kar rahe hai
 Later, Ananthamurthy admitted that his statement was made in a bit of sentimentality and there was no point in leaving the country
 lekin iske baad un par shabdic hamalon kii jhadi si lag gai
 He was also advised to go to Pakistan
 kehete hai, namo brigade naam ke kisi uddhat sanghathan ne 2014 main modi kii jeet ke baad unke liye pakistan ke tikat kareedne kaa elaan bhi kiya tha
 The only coincidence should be that Ananthamurthy left the world a few months after Narendra Modi's prime ministership
 haalanki bahut sambhav he ki apane jivan kaal ke antim dinon main apane upar ho rahe hamalon kaa bhi maansik dabaav bhi un par rahaa ho jisaki qeemat unke jism ne chukaai
 Knowingly or unknowingly, we lost a major writer in a communal attack
 lekin shaayad unke liye acha hi hua
 Otherwise, they would have been watching with more desperation how this society has started to respond to the legitimate concerns of writers-artists and intellectuals of its time
 jis bharat main ananthamurti parampara ke naam par thopi ja rahi jadta ko prashnaankit karte hue or bhashik-saanskrithik bahulata kii vakaalat karte hue ek bade lekhak bane, vah dhire-dhire har prashn ko kaarij karne par tula he, har chintaa ko saazish kii tarah dekhne kaa aadi hota ja rahaa he
 It is also a result of the dwindling space of poetry, art and compassion in society
 ananthamurti ke baad yah aamir khan ne kaha tha ki desh kaa badalata maahaul dekh unhen dar lagata he
 But Aamir Khan did not just say that
 unhone bharat kii bahulata or sahishnutaa par agaadh bharosa jataate hue badalte maahaul ko lekar apni ashanka jataai thi
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was also present at the event where Aamir said this
 lekin unhone badi chaalaaki se kaha ki kisi ko maahaul samajhate hue baat kerani chahie
 Hamid Ansari, who was the Vice President of the country after Aamir, was not spared
 baar-baar unke alag-alag vyavhaar ko rashtravirohi sabit karne kii koshish hui
 All those efforts turned out to be unfounded
 baad main jab hamid ansaari bahut shaleen lahaze main is badhati ashishnutaa kii ore ishaara kiya to un par bhi hamale shuru ho gaye
 Naseeruddin Shah's statement is different from these two
 naseer ko dar nahin lagata
 They get angry
 unhone saafe kaha he ki ve desh chhodane vaale nahin hai
 Obviously, they consider this country as their own
 lekin kya ham dhire-dhire ek desh ke bheetar hi ek aisa desh bana rahe hai jo naseer ko apana nahin maanata? yah shaq isliye hota he ki kisi ne unako dhiraj se sunne kii jarurat mahasoos nahin kii
 Even organizations like Shiv Sena, which grew up on the fertility of hatred and bigotry, started teaching them that they should make their children Hindustani
 jabaki naseer ne yahi baat kahi ki ve apane bacchon ko hindustani bana rahe hai, kal ko jab unase unka majahab poocha jayega to ve kya jawaab denge
 As Naseer was reminded that he is a Muslim, he has no right to express his fear or anger whatever
 ve rakhenge to kisi ke agent kii tarah hi rakhenge
 The matter is not limited to this
 phir naseer ke aalochakon ko puraane saare naam yaad aane lage or phir pakistan jane kii naseehaten duharai jane lageen
 Ananthamurthy had asked to leave the country, not to go to Pakistan
 bahut saare log desh chhodte hai- ve yahaan padhai karke duusare deshon main badi naukariyon main chale jate hai- kehete hai ki bharat main unke liye maukey nahin hai
 Modi comes between them by making speeches
 lekin ananthamurti ke sandarbh main desh chhodane kaa matlab pakistan janaa kyon ho gaya? ananthamurti to phir bhi vaicharik dushman the, paraaye nahin the
 But people like Nasir are really the people for whom Pakistan was created - the notion that in recent years has become so murky that we can define our Indianness, our nationality, our national character in the context of Pakistan
 Are engaged balki pakistan ke is sandarbh se ban rahaa hindustan kuch-kuch pakistan jaisaa hota ja rahaa he, iske saboot bad rahe hai
 In the last few years, every anti-government or ideology that has been declared as anti-nationalism has been seen almost barbarically celebrating the repression of minorities - those who do not celebrate, they also appear to be seeking arguments to justify it
 rajasthan main afaraazul ko maar kar uskaa video banane vaale shambhunath raigar ke liye chanda jutanaa, bulandshahr kii hinsa ke liye pakade gaye logon ke liye muft vakil muhaiyaa karana or goraksha ke aropiyon ko maala pehanaanaa jaise lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 In this context, there is another thing which is frightening
 jin lekhakon-patrakaron ko ham sanjeeda lekhak-patrkaar maanate rahe hai, unamem bhi kai nasiruddin shah ko agar paraayaa nahin to avishwasaneey bataane main jute hue hai
 They are just showing enough vigor to present Naseer as a pawn of electoral politics without advocating sending them straight to Pakistan - like Nasir Nejan has consciously made this statement before the election
 jimmedaar padon par baithe kuch log ‘puraskaar vaapasi gang' se unako jod rahe hai
 Needless to say that the term 'prize return gang' is also coined by this ideology which is trying to snatch away their credibility from writers
 iskaa istemaal karne vaale patrkaar or buddhijivi darasal apni bauddhik swaittata ko, pratirodh karne ke apane adhikaar ko, or apana puraskaar waapas karne kii bahut nijee karrwai ko bhi sandigdh banane par tule hai
 The need to understand is that today their targets are Nasir, tomorrow there will be others
 jaise bazaar sirf munaafaa dekhtaa he, jaat-paant nahin, vaise hi satta prerit kattarta bhi sirf satta dekhati he, majahab nahin
 He does not hesitate to kill Subodh Kumar as well for his purpose
 vah hemanth karkare jaise bahadur afasar par bhi sawaal khadey kar sakati he jise antat mumbai main aatanki hamale main jaan dekar apni deshbhakti sabit kerani padi
 Today they are against Aamir, Hamid Ansari and Naseer because they have pointed to their intolerance, tomorrow if you oppose their modalities, then they will be against you, stones will be thrown at your house too
 ve antat swatantra dhang se vichaar kiye jane ke khilaaf honge- ve chahenge ki aap unki hi bhashaa seekhen, bolen or apni pidiyon ko sikhaaen- nafrat or avishvaas kii vah bhashaa jo desh ko antat chota banaati chalati he
 The experiences of Pakistan and Afghanistan can be of great use in this matter
 lekin jo pakistan jaisaa hindustan banane par tule hai, ve isaki parvaah kyon karen
 Delhi BJP Adhyakshmanoj Tiwari was presented once again in the Supreme Court on the matter of sealing in the capital

 Punish those guilty of illegal manufacturing but do not disturb the public
 manoj tiwari nesupreme courtse maang karte hue kaha ki jab tak court agali sunwaayee main faisla nahin detaa tab tak dilli main ceiling band honi chahie

 In such a situation, breaking their house is not right
 is colony main kai saalon se rah rahe kareeb 3000 logon main se ab tak kareeb 300 log hi transit camp main shift hue hai
 People allege that the Delhi Development Authority is giving this about 5 acres of land to Raheja Builder to build residential buildings, but the government is ravaging it without a concrete plan to settle them
 tippaniyan Social worker Amit Singh says that a family has many houses here, but there the government is giving only one room to a family
 sarkaar yahaan ke logon se baari suraksha ke bich ghar khaali karne ke liye sahmati patr bharva rahi he, is aashwaasan ke saath ki unhen iske badale nae ghar milenge
 However, everyone is worried about when and where this series of homelessness will end
 unka kal kaisaa hoga
 Mohammed Ayub's family is also one of the displaced families

 In order to delay the announcement of Gujarat election dates, the Election Commission had argued that the state government should carry out relief work in flood affected areas
 haalanki vipaksh kii ore se dabaav banaae jane ke ek hafte baad tarikhon kaa elaan kar diya gaya, lekin chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki banaaskantha jile main baadh peediton ko muaavje ke naam par rajya sarkaar kii ore se ek dana bhi nahin mila he
 The entire crop of farmer Deviji Bhai Bhatar of Jetad village in Banaskantha district was submerged by the flood
 8 acre kii kheti vaali jameen baadh ke pani main dubi rahi or ab devi ke paas kheti laayak jameen nahin he
 The Gujarat government had announced compensation for these flood victims, but Deviji Bhai and 80 other farmers of Jetad village have not received any help from the government
 baadh peediton ne madad ke liye mukhyamantri ko bhi patr likhaa he, lekin colector kii ore se unhen keval aashwaasan mil rahaa he
 The farmers are feeling cheated by the assurances of the government and are thinking of a boycott of the assembly elections
 kai maheenon se muaavje ke intjaar main kisandeviji bhai ne kaha, 'ham pichley kai maheenon se muaavje kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 i have personally written to the government several times
 70 se 80 kisaanon ko sarkaar kii ore se koi madad nahin mili he
 The government has conducted the survey
 lekin agar unhone hamen madad nahin di, to ham is baar chunaavon kaa bahishkaar karne kii soch rahe hai
 'bharat Rajput, a farmer by profession, said that despite repeated requests from the village of Jetad, the government did not give any compensation nor gave any alternative land for cultivation
 aise main yuva kisaan bharat ne drip irigation pranali ke liye kuch fund ikattha kiya or apane khet main isaki dobaaraa shuruyaat kii
 So that it can be known whether something is produced in these flood affected fields
 bharat kehete hai ki 've log aae or hamaari jameen or khet kaa survey karke gaye, lekin unki ore se koi jawaab nahin mila
 As a last hope, we have restarted the drip irrigation system
 ummid he ki yah kaam karegaa or is jameen ko thodi upjau banayega, taaki kheti kii ja sake
 Not only Jetad, Kharia village also did not get compensation
 It is not that only Jetad village has not received any compensation from the government
 kharia gaanv ke kisaanon ko bhi sarkaar kii ore se koi muaavja nahin mila he
 These people wrote letters to leaders and ministers of political parties and demanded compensation and help
 lekin, sarkaar ke rate-rataae jawaab ke alaava baadh peediton ko kuch nahin mila
 This is the same village where 17 people lost their lives in the floods
 'khet hi nahin ghar bhi ho gaye barbaad'is baar kii baadh main khet or fasal ke alaava logon ke ghar bhi barbaad ho gaye
 Some people got help from the government, but there are also farmers like Nagji Bhai, who did not even get a single penny from the government and are now forced to live in a hut
 apane teen bhaaiyon or parivaar ke 14 sadasyon ke saath nagaji bhai eent ke makaan main rahete the
 The Gujarat floods have not only destroyed their house but have also forced them to stay in the hut at the same place
 jhopadi main rahane ko majaboor parivaranagaji bhai ke bhattije shravan ne kaha, 'hamaara ghar barbaad ho gaya, ab hamen jhopadi main rahanaa pad rahaa he
 The Chief Minister had said that we will get help from the government, but till now we have not got any help
 hamen dar he ki agar dobaaraa barish hui to hamaari jhopadi bhi barbaad ho jaaegi
 Hopefully someone will listen to our petition and help

 gujarat main porbandar ke paas bhartiya tatarakshak jahaaj ke ghere main aane ke baad pakistani boat ne jis tarah se apane aapako bam uda liya, usase yahi lagata he ki aatankwaadi ek baar phir 26 / 11 jaisaa hamalaa mumbai yaa kisi or shahar par karne kii firaaq main the, lekin bhartiya suraksha agencinyon kii satarkta or chaukasee kii vajah se inaki napak harakat kaamyaab nahi ho saki
 It is also necessary to mention here that these were suicide bombers, who are colloquially called suicide bombers, because they are the terrorists who do not care about their own lives to escape the grip of security agencies

 The goods that have been taken have been paid, and they are ready
 
 
 " aisa hi doosraa massej 31 disambar ko dopaher 12 baje bhi mila
 This input was passed on to the Marines and Coastguards
 isi dauraan pataa chalaa ki karachi ke keti bandargah se nikali pakistani boat antarrashtriya seemaa se hote hue bhartiya seemaa main 10 se 15 kilometre andar daakhil ho chuki he
 Then the ships of the Coastguard started chasing him and his siege was started
 us vakt paak boat chupchaap lite band karke andhere main bharat kii ore bad rahi thi
 The Coastguard stopped him and asked him to light the boat lights and search the boat
 is par pakistani boat teji se waapas karachi kii ore bhaagane kii koshish karne lagi
 After nearly an hour of chase, Coastguard Ship succeeded in stopping the Pakistani boat
 idhar nigaraanee jahaaj dornear bhi boat par najar rakhe hue tha
 About four people were seen on the boat, who ignored the Coastguard's warning
 bajaay deck ke upar aane ke, chaaron deck ke andar chale gaye
 After going inside, he blew himself up with a boat
 costguard ke ship ne bachaane kii bahut koshish kii, lekin andhera or mausam kharaab hone kii vajah se kuch bhi nahin bachaaya ja sakaa
 It is being said that the Pakistani boat had a large number of weapons and explosives, which they had to transfer to another boat
 suraksha agenciyon ko aise input pehle se hi mil rahe the ki aatanki phir se samudr ke raste bharat main daakhil ho sakate hai
 In 2008, similar Pakistani terrorists had entered the Indian border with a Pakistani boat before Karachi and then reached the devastation in Mumbai by kidnapping an Indian boat named 'kubera' in the sea near Porbandar
 is baar bhi, phir se aisi hi kisi aatanki sajeesh ko anjaam dene kii koshish thi, jise samay rahete pakad liya gaya
 Significantly, this time on the Republic Day, US President Barack Obama is the chief guest, then the terrorists were in a hurry to shoot two with one stone

 If no one has time and feels that there is nothing wrong in lying to him, then his chances of lying are increased
 ek naye adhyayan main yah nishkarsh nikaala gaya he
 Studies have shown that if one does not have any time at all and does not feel any shame on his behavior, he does not hesitate to lie
 univarsity of amsterdam or ben gurion univarsity, isroyal ke anusaar log shuru main apane vivek ke anuroop vyavhaar karte hai, lekin samay ke saath unako is baat kaa bhaan hota he ki saamaajik rup se sweekaarya swabhaav kya he or is bare main jaan lene ke baad vah usee ke anuroop vyavhaar karte hai
 Studyer Shaul Shalvi said in a statement, "when people work in haste, they think only of their own benefit
 agar kisi ke paas sochane kaa paryaapt samay ho to vah jhooth bolne kii buraai ko samajhataa he or jhooth bolne tathaa dhokhadhadi karne se bachataa he
 'researchers first studied 70 such people who had a tendency to lie and easily believed it to be correct
 shalavi ke anusaar is adhyayan ke parinaamon se is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ja saktaa he ki kaamkaaj or nijee jivan main kisi vyakti ke eemaandaar hone kii sambhaavna us samay bad jaati he jab vah kisi mushkil yaa jaldbaaji main na ho
 Instead, he has enough time to make decisions
 centre saraakar ne supreme court se kaha he ki ladaaku vimaan rafel (rafale) saude main exiaar (FIR) darj karne yaa sibiai (CBI) jaanch karaane kaa koi sawaal hi nahin he kyonki supreme court (supeme Court) pehle hi kah chukaa he ki is 'samvedansheel mudde' main uske hastkshep karne ke liye koi vajah nahin he
 The Central Government has said that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report has proved the main arguments of the petitioners about the alleged 'exorbitant price' of these fighter jets
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ke pichley saal 14 disambar ke us faisle par punarvichaar karne kii maang karne vaali yachikaaon ko centre sarkaar ne khaarij karne kii maang kii he, jis faisle main francisi company dasult (dassault) se 36 ladaaku vimaanon kii kharid par sarkaar ko clin chit di gai thi
 In its written plea of 39 pages filed in the Supreme Court, the Central Government has said that the petitioners and former Union Ministers Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie and Advocate Prashant Bhushan (prashant Bhushan) did not present any solid basis
 That could justify reconsideration of the December 14 decision
 centre sarkaar ne kaha ki khaastaur par tab, jab yah nyaayalay is nishkarsh par pahunch gaya ki sabhi teen pahaluon par jo nirnay lene kii prakriya, mulya nirdhaaran or bhartiya ofaset partner hai, bharat sarkaar dwaara 36 rafel ladaaku vimaanon kii kharid ke sanvadensheel mudde par court ke hastkshep karne kii koi vajah nahin he
 Also, there is no question of registering an FIR or getting the CBI investigated
 pradhan nyaayadhish nyaayamurti ranjan gogoi kii adhyakshata vaali teen nyaayadhishon kii peeth ne rafel maamle main 14 disambar ke faisle par punarvichaar karne kii yachikaaon par 10 may ko apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Apart from Sinha, Shourie and Bhushan, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh and advocate Vineet Dhanda have also filed reconsideration petitions

 The board made a big deal on television broadcasting rights in September

 film kaa naam: gabbar ij baikadiarector: krishastar cast:akshay kumaar,shruti hasan, sunil grover, jayadeep ahlavat , suman talavaarvadhi: 131 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga: 2 starindi filmon main rimek kaa chalan joro par he, kabhi hollywood kii prerana se filmein banati hai to kabhi south kii filmon kaa rimek
 In the past, along with hit remakes like Wanted and Rowdy Rathore, many failed Hindi remake films also came on screen
 aisi hi ek or tamil film ramanna (2002 main relies hui, nirdeshak e aar murgadaus kii film), jiske telegu or kannada rimek ke baad ab usee film kaa hindi rimek 'gabbar ij back' ke rup main banaaya gaya he
 In other languages, the film was a super hit but will it be a success in Hindi? Let's find out, first story-gabbar (akshay Kumar) takes up the task of ending the issues of society, the biggest issue is corruption for which the common man While forming a team, Gabbar sometimes teaches the Tehsildars a lesson and sometimes brings the story of hospital robbery to everyone and finally the events in his past While the end makes learning together
 is puure ghatnakram main uskaa saamana CBI pramukh (jayadeep ahlavat), udyogpati patil (suman talwaar), sadhu (sunil grover) or vakil ke rup main shruti (shruti hasan) se bhi hota he
 Akshay Kumar's presence complements the action in the film, but there is nothing that you are getting new from Akshay, Akshay Kumar playing the character of a common man is completely like a superhero anytime and anyone They are also able to teach a lesson
 roudi rathore ke baad ye atakalein thi kii is film ke dwaara bhi kai saare dialog sunne or yaad karne ko milenge, lekin ek bhi samvaad us str kaa nahin he jo aapako yaad rah jaae
 The story was quite simple but the entire film may have to bear the brunt of the experiments of director Krish, due to the light screenplay, no one can be judged when Shruti's character comes and goes
 agar film ke villen kii baat karen to suman talwaar jaisaa south kaa superstar bhi is film ko wo gati nahin de paata he, jo ek achche negative kirdaar ko karnaa chahie
 There is some emptiness in his dialogue as well
 karina kapur khan kii kuch pal kii maujuudagi bhi sirf ek gane kii thi or mere hisaab se akshay kumaar ke kirdaar ko ek leader ke rup main sthapit karne ke liye diarector ko thodaa vakt or lenaa chahie tha
 In this film, only Sunil Grover's character is such that you have a little more sympathy, Sunil's track from the beginning to the end is the best
 film ke sangeet kaa prayog bhi bahut hi galat tareeke se hua he, jab kabhi aap mudde ke prati gambhir hote hai usee pal gane kii vajah se film kii gati avaruddh hoti he jisaki vajah se bechaini badhane lagati he kii film kab aage badhegi or yahi nahin is film main aapako raju hiraani dwaara '3 idiyats' dikhaae gaye delivery system kii jhalak bhi dekhne ko milegi
 The film's scene of a hospital is very accurately filmed which can be successful to some extent in opening the hospital administration and Akshay has told some things which may be needy for the students, such as 5 things quite Essential - 'stretch, pressure, break, twist and turn' but a sense of leadership has not been fulfilled somewhere
 trailor dekh kar lagata tha kii sanvaadon par bhar bhar ke taaliyaan bajegi, lekin film ke dauraan aisa koi bhi pal nahin aayaa jab laga ho kii tali jor se bajaani chahie
 The climax of the film then takes you above the limits of boredom and the only question comes to mind is 'when will this film come to an end?' So this week if you are a very big fan or fan of actor Akshay Kumar or Sunil Grover and Only if Shruti Haasan is convincing, watch this film otherwise you can find some other means of entertainment with the same money
