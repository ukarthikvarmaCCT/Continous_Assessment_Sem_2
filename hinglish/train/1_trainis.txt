 Jaitley said, 'I had never said such a thing

 And those people who are outside the tax net do not have to bear the burden
 unhone kaha, 'jab arthvyavastha bad rahi thi to bharat indiarect tex par chal rahaa tha

 Actually there are more than 20,000 items at the shop, so listing every single item is not an easy task
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki jiesti se bhrashtachar or kaale dhan par lagaam lagegi par jiesti kii pechidagi or isko lekar ashankaon ne logon ko asamanjas main daal rakhaa he
 Simran, a resident of Delhi, praised the GST as a "historic initiative", but there were many questions in his mind, which are yet to be answered
 jiesti ko krantikari pahal bataakar sarkaar apni peeth thok rahi lekin 70 saal ke itihaas ko badalane ke liye jameen par majboot vyavastha hona behaj jaruri he
 In such a situation, there is a challenge before the government to remove the misconceptions spread on GST at the earliest

 sudhaar ke naam par sarkaar aise kadam uthaa rahi he, jo logon kii jeb par baari pad rahaa he
 There is discontent in the Congress itself
 kahin logon kii naaraazgi or party kaa asantosh agle chunaav main jeet kii ummiido par pani naa pher de, isliye sonia ne sabko talmail kii ghutti pilaayi
 The message was to reach the common man, that is why the Congress governing the country rode on the bus
 thand kii sansanaahat ke bich party or sarkaar main garmi foonkane kii ye nai koshish he congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii
 SPG security was the same, but Sonia Gandhi boarded a bus from 24 Akbar Road instead of a convoy of vehicles
 or saath main the unke bete or congress ke number 2 netaa rahul gandhi
 Then both the organization and the government followed Sonia and Rahul out to the Surajkund where the dialogue of Havan Kund was punished
 sarkaar or sanghathan ne baatcheet kii aanch par apni khaamiyon ko galane or chhavi ko chamakaane kaa sankalp liya
 There is hardly 18 months left, when the public will ask for the full account of five years from the Manmohan Singh government and the Congress that runs the government
 8 saal se congress kaa naaraa he- congress kaa haath-aam aadmi ke saath
 The needs related to that common man may be going on from corruption to inflation, but the biggest leader of Congress is confident that this move of the organization and the government will cross the Baitarani of 2014
 khud sonia gandhi ne samvaad kii shuruyaat karte hue surajkund main kaha- pichley 8 varshon kii hamaari shandaar uplabdhiyon kaa itihaas hamaare saath he
 We should be proud of our commitment in the interest of common man, this commitment is religion for us
 pichley 8 saal main hamane apane bharat ko bahut had tak zyada samvedansheel bharat banaaya he
 For all sections of society — especially the weaker sections, we have taken many historical and important steps
 haalanki abhi bhi hamaare saamne bahut kathin chunautiyaan hai
 Yet history will testify that our unmatched programs and laws have changed the picture of India
 sarkaar kii kamyaabiyaan ginate hue party kii adhyaksh ko agar-magar se lekar haalanki or phir bhi jaisi baishakhiyon kii jarurat padi
 Now the question is that the Iqbal of the government is high and what was needed to strengthen the organization
 khud sonia gandhi kaa bhaashan hi congress kii dukhati rag par haath rakh gaya
 Our government has to take some decisions due to the current critical condition, due to which the common people have suffered a lot
 hamaare saamne chunauti yah he ki ham logon ko un majaburiyon ke bare main saaf-saaf bataaen or samajhaayen, jinaki vajah se ye kathin faisle liye gayi
 In the recent reshuffle in Manmohan's cabinet, many ministers came from the government to the organization and the organization came to the government
 lekin is pherbadal se bhi party or sarkaar ke bich behatar talmail najar nahin aata
 That is why Sonia Gandhi had to say in a loud voice that work together, otherwise there will be trouble
 congress kaaryakarta hone ke naate ham sabhi ek hi parivaar ke sadsy hai
 Each one of us has our own responsibility, be it as a minister in the government or as an officer in the organization
 yah swaabhaavik he ki kabhi-kabhi aise maukey aae ki hamen party or sarkaar donon kii jimmedaariyon ke nirvaah main santulan baitaane kii jarurat mahasoos ho

 When he was talked about the riots in Bhima Koregaon, Udayanraje Bhosle said that there will be some benefit from these riots
 200 saal pehle kii baat karne ke bajaay hamen pragati kii ore apana dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie
 Today people are being pushed only towards the vote bank
 udayanraaje ne kaha ki maine gaanvvaalon se phone par baat kii thi
 Everyone lives together in the village, but how did this happen suddenly, no one knew anything
 ab logon ko samajhnaa hoga kii kaise chhatrapati shivaji maharaj,chhatrapati sambhajimaharaj jaise mahaan vyaktiyon ne sabhi jaat ke logon ko hameshaa saath lekar chale or unhone kabhi bhi koi bhed-bhav nahin kiya
 So, today, despite many years, people celebrate his birth anniversary
 logon ko in mahaan vyaktiyon se siikhnaa chahie kii logon se kaisaa bartaav kiya jaataa he
 Udayanraje further said that in this age of today people should forget caste
 thik usee tarah jaise accident hone par pesheynt kii jaat nahin blad group dekha jaataa he
 Now there is no use in discussing what happened 200 years ago
 jaatiya rangon kii tarah hoti he koi bhagava koi nila to koi haraa
 The rainbow also has seven colors and all the colors coexist, we should also live together
 hameshaa se hi logon ko vot bank ke liye kisi nemusalamanonko apane saath rakhaa to vahiin kabhi kuch logon ne daliton ko apane paas kar liya
 But nobody ever thought what is right for the country and what is wrong
 aaj jo sabase zyada jaruri he chijen he jaise shiksha, medical suvidhaayen ye sari chijen non ishu ho gai hai or ye hinsa charchaa kaa vishay ban gaya he
 Before friendship, we never think about who belongs to which caste, then we should not think about other times also

 Udayanraje further said that the farmers have suffered a lot in the last two days
 agar gramin or shaharon ke bich jhagada ho gaya to shahar ke logon ko anaaj nahin milegaa balki bahaar se emport karaane kii naubat aa jaaegi
 Udayanrajen also said that doing my way will do nothing
 mujhe kuch fark nahin padataa koun kis party se he
 If someone is wrong then he is wrong
 agar kisi ne galati kii he to karrwai bhi honi chahie
 i think this investigation, investigation committee is all nonsense

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) veteran Sushma Swaraj has claimed that the BJP is moving towards a majority in UP, bypassing all surveys and estimates
 lakhanu sthit party karyaalay main ek samvaadadaata sammelan main sushamaa ne kaha, 'pehle yah kaha ja rahaa tha ki vidhansabha chunaav main mukhya muqabla bahujan samaaj party (basapa) or samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke bich he, lekin jahaan tak mujhe lagata he or prachaar ke dauraan maine mahasoos kiya he, uske anusaar bhaajapa bahumat kii ore bad rahi he
 Sushma said that BJP is benefiting from the wave against BSP, because BJP is the first choice of the public
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki janata sapa ke shashan ko bhi dekh chuki he or vah dobaaraa us taraf nahin janaa chaahati
 Taking a dig at the Gandhi family, he said that to make a place on the front page of newspapers, he is campaigning on the lines of Hindi films
 sushamaa ke mutabik, 'mujhe lagata he ki gandhi parivaar ne iske liye kisi company ke saath samjhauta kiya he, jo yah suzav detaa he ki aap aaj yah karenge to kal aapaki photo akhbaar ke pehle panne par hogi
 Under this strategy, Rahul Gandhi sometimes breaks the list and sometimes Priyanka jokes with her mother on stage
 ' sushamaa ne kaha, 'bhaajapa chunaav muddon ke aadhaar par lard rahi he, jabaki anya dal isse bhaag rahe hai
 That is why people are considering BJP as their first choice

 The loss in the terrorist attack in Samba in Jammu and Kashmir could have been worse, but thankfully nothing happened
 aatankiyon ne jahaan hamalaa kiya, vahaan paas hi ek army skool bhi he or nau baje se bachche skool aana shuru ho jate hai
 In this case, guess what would have happened if the terrorists had carried out this attack after few hours
 to kya aatanki peshawar jaisi ghatana dohraane ki sajeesh rach rahe the? is baat se puri tarah se inkaar bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 However, after imagining it, the mind trembles and the whole body runs like a shudder
 beete saal pakistan ke peshawar ke army skool main hue aatanki hamale main 150 se zyada log maare gaye the, jinamein zyaadaatar bachche the
 However, taking lessons from the incident in Peshawar, the army has already increased security arrangements in all the army schools across the country
 agar aatanki hamalaa karen to usase kaise bachenge or kya karne chahie isaki training to bacchon se lekar teacher tak ko di hai he, lekin marane-maarane par utaaru vahashi darindon kaa kya? Even more important is that not even a month has passed in Jammu and Kashmir that this is the second terrorist attack, that too within just 24 hours
 shuukravaar ko kathua police steshpe par aatankiyon ne hamalaa kar teen pulicekarmi sahit ek naagarik ko maar daalaa, jisase aman chaiyn par dobaaraa sawaal uthne lage hai
 At this place, two and a half years ago, two terrorists attacked the army camp
 us hamale main sena ke ek major or ek jawan shahid ho gaye the
 Before the attack in Samba, the terrorists attacked the Hiranagar police station, during which around 11 people were killed
 us vakt bhi aatanki antarrashtriya seemaa paar kar daakhil hue the or apane makasad main kaaphi had tak kaamyaab hue the
 This time also the terrorists attacked the police station of Kathua before attacking Samba
 kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki ye aatanki usee group kaa hissaa hai jo shuukravaar ko antarrashtriya seemaa paar kar daakhil hue the
 One group attacked Kathua and the other at Samba Army Camp
 ye aatanki usee raste se ghuse jahaan tarbandi he, biguef 24 ghante alert he or daawa karti he ki parinda bhi par nahi maar saktaa he
 This time too, these terror attacks hit many targets
 in hamalon ne yah dikhaa diya he ki jammu-kashmir main aatankiyon kii pakad kamjor nahin hui he
 He has also hit the economic structure of the state by attacking the pathankot-jammu National Highway, because this is the only way to reach the state by road from any part of the country
 yahaan sawaal ye bhi uthta he aatankiyon ne aakhir jammu ke ilaake main hi nishaanaa kyon saadhaa? kya udhonen apana target kashmir se jammu shift kar liya he? kya iske peeche kii vajah yah to nahin ki vah dilli ko koi sandesh dena chaahate hai? bijepi ne jo 25 siten jiti he vah saare jammu ilaake kii hai
 It is a matter of fact that the Chief Minister of the state, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, is taking a soft attitude towards the terrorists and is the result that the terrorists are encouraged? After the terrorist attack in Kutha yesterday, the Chief Minister said that this problem cannot be solved with guns and for this, talks are necessary
 lekin lakh take kaa sawaal yah he ki baatcheet kisase? kya fidine hamalaa karne vaale aatankiyon se? yah to nahin ho saktaa to phir baatcheet kisase? By the way, say Mufti Sahab's pressure or some other government is talking to Pakistan once again and insisting on improving the relationship
 par kya pakistan ne aatank se apana naata tod liya he? or usase baat karke vaaki main kya ek nai shuruyaat ho sakati he? yaa hameshaa kii tarah yah pahal bhi pehle kii tarah dhak ke teen paat sabit hogi

 bharat ke chif justise deepak mishra ke khilaaf mahabhiyog laane ke prastaav ko lekar congress khud hi ekamat najar nahin aati
 With the commencement of the current session of Parliament, there have been reports of Congress bringing such a proposal
 haalanki congress ne aadhikarik taur par is sambandh main ab tak kuch nahin kaha
 According to sources, senior party leader and Rajya Sabha member Ahmed Patel is not in favor of impeachment motion against Chief Justice Deepak Mishra and has also conveyed his opinion to Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 congress aisa koi bhi kadam uthaane se pehle usase jude tamaam siyaasi napha-nuksaan par gaur kar rahi he
 Some Congress leaders feel that during the election year, the BJP can try to take advantage of this kind of move by calling the BJP anti-ram temple and anti-hindu
 vahiin congress legal cell ke pramukh or saansad vivek tankhaa ne bhi kaha he ki mahabhiyog ko lekar party ne abhi koi faisla nahin kiya he
 According to sources, on the other hand, some leaders in Congress are also of the opinion that the way the four senior judges of the Supreme Court came up and raised questions about the working style of the Chief Justice in the press conference, the party must bring a motion for impeachment
 grand old party main jahaan ahamed patel ke saath saansad jyotiraditya sindhiya bhi chif justise ke khilaaf mahabhiyog prastaav laae jane ke paksh main nahin hai
 At the same time, according to the opinion of senior party leader and eminent lawyer Kapil Sibal and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, impeachment motion should be brought
 aadhikarik taur par congress ne is mudde par abhi sthiti saaf nahin kii he
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said to 'aaj Tak', 'we have not taken any decision yet
 ’bataa den ki congress aisa prastaav laane se pehle chaahati he ki issamvedansheel muddaper samaan soch vaali partiyon ke bich ekajutata dikhaai de
 In this effort, the Congress has also signed several allies
 jin sahyogi dalon ne congress ke kuch saansadon ke saath prastaav par dastakhat kiye the, wo ye jaanane ke liye dabaav badha rahe hai ki mahabhiyog prastaav laane ke liye notice kyon nahin diya ja rahaa he
 According to sources, the proposal of the Congress high command to bring impeachment against the Chief Justice can also be put on hold
 baharhaal, abhi congress ke andar hi netaaon main is masale par alag alag raay he or asamanjas bana hua he
 As soon as the results of 12th, students vie for admission to a good college in Delhi
 sabhi acchhee uniwarsities main admician chaahate hai, jisase unka bhavishya sanvar jaae
 But here the biggest battle begins with the cut-off, due to which, despite 85 to 95 percent marks, the students are worried whether they will get a good college or not
 kya he rohinee kii neha kii kahani?badhatecompitishnane dilli ke chaatro kii mushkilen badha di hai
 In fact, in all the major colleges in Delhi, students from all over the country hope to apply
 aise main sabhi college cat of yaa merit ke aadhaar par daakhila lete hai
 Due to this, the students of Delhi who have scored 80 to 90 percent are very upset
 dilli ke rohinee kii rahane vaali neha ne commers se 91 pratishat ank hasil kiye hai
 Neha, who is expecting more than 95 percent, is sad now because she knows that it is very difficult to get admission in a big college
 neha ek behad saadhaaran parivaar se he or uske pita celsomen he or maa housewif
 Neha's parents have high hopes from her
 uske pita khud pard nahi sake lekin beti ko ek achche college main daakhila dilaanaa chaahate hai, jisase wo sie ke entrens kii taiyaari kar paae
 Dharamveer is also very upset like Betaniha, a promising Dhobi
 dharmaveer ke pita istre kaa kaam kar ghar kaa kharchaa chalaate hai
 He came to Delhi from Rajasthan in 2004 after dreaming of a better future for his children and today he is proud of his son
 88 pratishat ank laane vaale dharmaveer ke saamne ab achche college main daakhile kii samasya he
 His family does not have enough money to get him admitted to a big private college
 dharmaveer dilli polis or army join karnaa chahta he, par graduate hone ke liye use acha college chahie jiske liye wo sarkari scolership kii ummid kar rahaa he
 Despite 95 percent, the family of Himank, who got an unhappy 95 percentile, is happy but also scared
 samasya ye he ki himank architekchar or jeii karnaa chahta he, or 12ve main itani mehnat ke baad ab use dobarijineeringentrens test ke liye doguni mehnat kerani pad rahi he
 Himank's sister has full faith in her brother but Himank is worried about his future even after such good marks
 ab ise ham ajukeshan system kii khami kahe yaa lagaataar badhata compitishan, itane achche ank paane vaale chaatr bhi apane bhavishya ko lekar pareshaan hai
 After the humiliating defeat of the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Madhya Pradesh (loksabha Election Results 2019), the demand for change in the party leadership of the state has intensified
 kamalnath (kamal Nath) sarkaar ke kam se kam teen cabinet mantriyon ne pashchimi uttarapradesh ke prabharee or congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv purv kendriya mantri jyotiraditya sindhiya (jyotiraditya Scindia) ko madhyapradesh congress (MP Congress) cameti kaa adhyaksh banane kii maang kii he
 Minister for Women and Child Development, Imrati Devi, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Pradyuman Singh Tomar and Revenue and Transport Minister Govind Singh Rajput have expressed their choice and said that the appointment of a young and energetic leader like Jyotiraditya Scindia as the state Congress chief would be the workers
 There will be new enthusiasm in me
 pradhyumna singh tomars ne enditivi se kaha, "mujhe bhi lagata he ki sanghathan main satta alag or pradesh adhyaksh alag hona chahie
 Our Chief Minister himself is saying
 yah nirnay party ko karnaa he
 There are many people in the party
 sanghathan main takat dene kii baat he, sanghathan chalaane kii baat he to meri vyaktigat raay main sindhiya ji is bhoomika ke liye ek upyukt vyaktitv hai
 This demand is not from the Scindia camp, this demand is from every worker of the state
 agar ve pradesh adhyaksh bananaa chaahate hai to ve kal hi ban sakate hai, ve hamase yah kehane ko nahin kah rahe hai
 Govind Singh Rajput told NDTV, "if the party wins or loses, the chief minister or the party chief is responsible, but we all together take accountability
 jab haikaman congress ke apni jimmedaari swayan le rahe hai to kai pradeshon ke adhyakshon ne istife die hai
 In Madhya Pradesh, the president is in two positions, the chief minister is also the president
 aisi sthiti main swabhaavik he ek pad chhodane ke ve khud bhi icchhuk hai kyonki dohari zimmedaari lambey vakt tak koi vyakti nahin nibhaa saktaa he
 Rahul Gandhi will decide Scindia's role as he is also the General Secretary
 agar madhyapradesh main unhen adhyaksh banaakar bhejte hai to sindhiya camp hi nahin puure pradesh main sabko khushi hogi
 Because we all know their working abilities

 engiti ne paryaavaran ko dekhte hue yatra ke dauraan kuch niyam banaae hai
 The NGT has said that the area around the sacred cave is extremely sensitive
 lihaaja vahaan jayakaara nahin lagane ko kaha gaya he
 Due to the sensitivity of the glaciers in this area, there should be no noise, so the number of passengers should also be limited
 samudratal se 13,600 foot kii oonchai par pavitra gupha sthit he
 There is a lot of lack of oxygen at this place
 neshnal green tribunel kaa kahana he ki jis jagah par pavitra gupha he, vahaan kii samvedansheeltaa ko dekhte hue shivlinga ke saamne shanti banaae rakhni chahie
 This instruction of the NGT was demanded by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad to be withdrawn
 bataa den ki amarnath yatra ke dauraan bhakt bhagwaan shiv ke jayakaare lagaate hue jate hai
 They also play bells in many places
 land slide (pathar girane) kii ghatnaon par roak lagane ke liye engiti ne yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 Let us tell you that the NGT has reprimanded the Amarnath Shrine Board for not providing adequate infrastructure to the devotees
 har saal kii tarah is baar bhi nagpanchami ke maukey par bihar ke samastipur main sanpon kaa mela laga
 Not only Bihar, people from other states also came to see this amazing fair
 ye mela kareeb 300 saal se lagata aa rahaa he
 During this period, Bhagwati is worshiped first and then the process of removing snakes from the Gandak river begins
 logon kii manyata he is din maangi gai muraad jarur puri hoti he
 Three women involved in the smuggling of more than 300 turtles were arrested on Sunday in Rohtas district of Bihar

 samaajawaadee party ke nae sarvesarva akhilesh yadav ne ravivaar ko jabparty kaa ghoshnaa patrajari kiya to do kamiyon kii ore sabakaa dhyaan gaya
 First, Mulayam Singh Yadav on stage and second, the issues of Muslims in the manifesto
 kya ye mahaj ittefaq tha yaa mulaayam yug se akhilesh yug vaali sapa kaa swaabhaavik cheharaa? jaankaar ise akhilesh yadav kaa siyaasi daanv maan rahe hai jiske safal yaa vifal rahane kaa sidhaa asar akhilesh ke siyaasi bhavishya par padane vaala he
 In the 2012 assembly elections, the Samajwadi Party promised 18 percent reservation to Muslims
 chunaav main sapa ko muslimon ke mili ekamusth voton ke peeche ye elaan ahm vajah bataaya gaya tha kyonki un chunaavon main takreeban 45 fisadi muslim vot samaajawaadee party ko mili the
 In the general election 2014 election manifesto, the Samajwadi Party promised to give 15 percent reservation to Muslims in police and PAC, although Mulayam got Muslim votes in the 2014 elections but got only four seats
 2014 kii karaari haar se liya he sabak2014 ke baad haar kii samiksha ke liye yojit baithak main ye baat uthi thi ki party ne alpsankhyakon ke kalyaan ke kaarykram itane jor-shor se prasaarit kiye ki pratirodh main yadav bhi 'hindu' ho gaya or bijepi ko vot de baitha
 It is believed that Akhilesh has not done any welfare scheme for Muslims separately from the platform
 unhone mahilaon, chaatro, yuvaaon, garibon, kisaanon kaarobaariyon har tabake ke bare main baat kii lekin alpsankhyak varg jo hameshaa se sapa ke ghoshnaptr kaa ahm hissaa rahaa he, wo is baar nadaarad tha
 Like last time, this time the manifesto did not talk of Muslim reservation, nor was there any promise of release of innocent Muslim youths who were caught on terror charges
 urdu talim yaa madrason ko lekar bhi koi bada vaayada akhilesh kii ore se nahin kiya gaya
 Akhilesh does not want the image of 'maulana' Mulayam , after this declaration of Akhilesh, the Rashtriya Manch, an organization fighting for the rights of Muslim youth, accused him of retreating from the issues of Muslims, although political experts consider this to be a vision of Akhilesh's vision
 Huh
 akhilesh ke pita mulaayam singh yadav muslim hiton kii raajnneeti karte rahe hai
 He has also got full support of Muslims
 ek samay unke kattar virdohi unhen 'moulana' mulaayam tak kehane lage the
 It is believed that Akhilesh wants to extricate himself from this image of his father
 unhone mahilaon, bacchon, garibon, kuposhiton ko liye jo loklubhaavan elaan kiye hai, wo har tabake kii tarah muslim tabake ko bhi phayda pahunchaayenge lekin unpar tushtikaran kii raajnneeti kaa aarope virdohi nahin laga sakenge
 Agenda for sp's expansion outside UP One of the reasons behind Akhilesh's move could also be related to his plan to expand SP outside UP
 mulaayam hon yaa lalu prasad yadav donon netaaon ko unke pradesh kramshah upi or bihar main muslim voton ke chalate bharpoor kamyaabi mili lekin apni muslim parast chhavi ke chalate hi ve apane pradesh ke baahar lokapriy nahin ho sake or unki partiyon kaa vajood unke pradesh tak hi simit rahaa
 The way Akhilesh has made development an agenda and has included every section in that agenda, if he gets success in UP, then he can establish Samajwadi Party as a political force in other Hindi speaking states on the basis of this agenda
 Huh
 muslim vot bidke to hoga nuksskhilesh ke is faisle ke peeche ek badi risk bhi he
 The UP assembly election is triangular this time
 mahaj kuch pratishat voton ke idhar se udhar ho jane se partiyon ke haath se satta idhar kii udhar ho sakati he
 For BSP and SP, victory or defeat is to be decided by Muslim votes in addition to their traditional jatav-yadav votes
 mayawati lagaataar muslim samudaay ko ye sandesh de rahi hai ki unke hiton kii raksha keval basapa kar sakati he
 He has distributed tickets to a large number of Muslims
 party main mache ghamaasan ke vakt khud mulaayam singh yadav ne akhilesh par muslim virdohi hone kaa aarope madha tha
 If the Muslim voter is angry with the SP and goes to the bsp's court, then on his first political front, Akhilesh may have to face a severe defeat
 congress main adhyaksh pad ke liye maathapai jari he
 According to information received from sources, Priyanka Gandhi was asked by senior leaders of Congress about the post of President whether she would like to take over the reins of the party? In response to this question, Priyanka told senior Congress leaders that the question of the post of president does not arise
 or mere naam ko is pad kavikalp bhi na mana jaae
 She said that she will continue to work for the post of general secretary in the party
 jaankaree ke mutabik congress ke senior netaaon ko band lipaphe main ek naam dene ke liye kaha gaya he
 No agreement has been reached for this position so far
 congress adhyaksh pad kii prakriya main congress 7 varisht netaaon kaa naam shaamil kiya gaya he jisamen mallikarjun khadge, susheel kumaar scindia, digvijay singh, shailaja, mukul vaasanic, sachin payalat or sindhiya kaa naam shaamil hai
 Let us tell you that the Congress will first elect an interim president and after that internal elections will be held
 kaarysmiti ke adhyakshon kii avadharana tab tak sambhav nahin he
 Unless the party president or interim president agrees
 party ke kai senior netaaon ne saarvajanik taur par apni ichha jaahir kii thi ki rahul gandhi ke istife ke baad priyanka gandhi, party kii bagdor apane haath main len
 Let me tell you, Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post of the party president, taking moral responsibility for the defeat of the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad se party abhi tak adhyaksh tay nahin kar pai he
 Rahul Gandhi made his resignation public earlier this month, writing a four-page letter
 philhal rahul gandhi kii vaapasi kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 According to the information, as soon as Rahul Gandhi comes back, a meeting of CWC will be called to consider the Congress President's post and future plans of the party
 jan lokapal vidheyak par ek saath aae anna hajaare or arvind kejariwal ke sambandhon main kitni daraar pad chuki he, yah aaj tak ko die gaye anna ke intervyuu se pataa chalata he, jahaan is bujurg netaa ne apane purv shishy ko aashirwad dene tak se inkaar kar diya
 Bitterness is clearly visible in Anna and Kejriwal's personal relationships
 anna beshak kejariwal ke raajnneeti main aane se naaraaz hon yaa phir chande kii rakam ke maamle main andeh karte hon, phir bhi unka itnaa gussa samaj se baahar he
 Kejriwal with whom he always consulted, with whose opinion he kept making moves and who remained with him in the movement, why did he become so annoyed by one of his steps? Such a big movement on Janlokpal bill that the government got the law Could not force bringing, which he believes will guarantee honest rule in the country, then why did Kejriwal jump into politics because of his displeasure? Area his admirable decision to keep away, but the responsibility of muscling their bills eventually politicians
 yah baat anna acchhee tarah se jaanate hai, to phir kejariwal ne raajnneeti kii duniya main chalaang lagaakar koun-sa aparaadh kar diya?kya vah abhi bhi is mugalate main hai ki unke kehane par is desh main vah aitihaasik bill aa jayega, jisase halaat badal jaaenge? par, aisa kuch hone vaala nahin he
 Like a karmayogi, he must keep on trying, but the truth is that there is no significant progress in this matter, because our politicians will never hit the ax on their feet
 arvind kejariwal kaa rasta behad lanbaa or duruh he
 Entering the morass of politics, searching for Shuchita will be a new experience for him
 unhone yah faisla karke koi itnaa bada aparaadh bhi nahin kiya ki anna itane naaraaz ho jaaen ki aashirwad bhi na den
 Of course, he should keep himself away from Kejriwal's political activities but two words of good luck or words of blessings will not make him part of the political campaign of his former disciple

 mumbai ko aadhe ghante ke khel se thik pehle balavant singh ko box main giraae jane ke kaaran penlti mili, jis par imana ne gol karne main koi galati nahin kii
 After Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi, Trinamool Congress (TMC) mps have also been barred from going to Sonbhadra by the UP government
 shanivaar ko tiemasi saansadon ko upi police ne banaras airport se baahar aane kii anumati nahin di
 Enraged by this attitude of the UP administration, TMC MP Derek o'brien sat on a dharna at the Banaras Airport with his colleagues
 derek o bryan ne kaha ki ediem or espi ne hamen bataaya ki hamen hiraasat main liya ja rahaa he kyonki yahaan dhara 144 lagu he
 But we told them that we are three people and in the event of Section 144 being implemented, if five or more people go together then it is considered a violation
 lekin ham to sirf hai
 We will try to go to BHU Trauma Center from here where the injured people have been kept in the Sonbhadra incident
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ko bhi sonbhadra jane se roak diya gaya tha
 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra spent the night at Chunar Guest House, not accepting the advice of the authorities to return
 priyanka or adhikariyon ke bich raat kareeb 12:00 baje se 1:15 baje tak chali duusare daur kii baatcheet bhi naakaam rahi or priyanka va unke saikadon samarthak chunaar guest house main hi date rahe
 In a series of tweets late last night, Priyanka said that the Uttar Pradesh government sent Varanasi zone Additional Director General of Police Brij Bhushan, Varanasi's Divisional Commissioner Deepak Aggarwal and Deputy Inspector General of Police to tell me that i should return here without meeting the victims
 naa mujhe hiraasat main rakhane kaa aadhaar bataaya gaya he or naa hi koi kaagaj die gaye
 He said in another tweet that according to my lawyers my arrest is illegal in every way
 maine spasht kar diya he ki main kisi dhara kaa ulanghan karne nahin balki peediton se milane ai hum
 i have told the messengers of the government that i will not go back without meeting them
 priyanka ne ek video bhi twit kiya he jisamen varisht prashasnic or police adhikari raat kareeb 1:15 baje unase baithak benatija khatm hone ke baad waapas jate dikh rahe hai
 Congress Legislature Party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu, present at the Chunar Guest House along with Priyanka and other supporters, told 'bhasha' on Saturday that the government was forcing them to leave the guest house by shutting off electricity and water supply but did not step back
 Will be removed unhone bataaya ki puri raat bijli nahin ai
 During this, Priyanka sat with the workers till about 4:30 in the morning
 sarkaar ne guest house main jalpan kaa koi intjaam nahin kiya
 Local citizens and party workers are making some arrangements
 maaloom ho ki congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra ko sonbhadra main hue samuhik hatyakand ke peedit pariwaron se milane jane ke dauraan shuukravaar ko mirzapur ke adalhat kshetra main prashasan ne rokkar aparaadh prakriya samhita kii dhara 151 ke tahat hiraasat main le liya tha
 He was later brought to the Chunar Guest House
 prashasan ke aalaa adhikariyon ne unhen sonbhadra main dhara 144 lagu hone kii baat kehete hue waapas laut jane ko kaha lekin priyanka ne unhen jawaab diya ki vah akeli hi sonbhadra jaakar peediton se milane ke liye taiyaar hai
 In such a situation, no injunction will be violated
 unhone saaf kaha or vah unase mili bagaiyr waapas nahin jaaengi
 The stalemate that has started since then continues
 bhartiya captain viraat kohli ne kaha he ki sidney cricket ground (SCG) par australia main pehali baar test siries jeetna kaaphi badi uplabdhi hogi, kyonki isi maidan se unki captaini main team main badlaav ke daur kii shuruyaat hui thi
 After Mahendra Singh Dhoni retired, Kohli took charge as the Indian Test captain at the same ground four years ago
 bharat tab duniya kii saatven number kii team thi or ab is praaroop main duniya kii number ek team he
 Team India has decided to retain the border-gavaskar Trophy with an unassailable 2-1 lead in the four-match series
 kohli ne guuruuvaar se shuru hone chauthe or antim test kii purv sandhya par kaha, ‘sirf chaar saal hue hai (mujhe captaini sanbhale)
 If it does, it would be awesome
 kyonki main teesri baar yahaan test daure par aayaa hum or mujhe pataa he ki yahaan jeetna kitna mushkil he
 The Indian captain said, "you can do well in Australia, but winning as a team has been our biggest challenge
" eemaandaaree se kahuun, to pichley do dauron ke vyaktigat pradarshan kisi ko yaad bhi nahin hai
 From tomorrow, Virat Brigadekohli, who will make history, said that winning the final Test would be another step towards achieving consistency in performance
 unhone kaha, ‘aapkaa naam bhale hi sammaan ke saath board par likhaa ho, lekin agar aapaki team jeet darj nahin karti, to yah myne nahin rakhata
 So far it is a big thing, winning a big series, not only for me, but also for the whole team
 kyonki isi sthaan par hamane badlaav ke daur kii shuruyaat kii thi
 'the Indian captain said,' It was at this venue when Mahendra Singh Dhoni relinquished the captaincy (in 2014) and our team was quite young, the world's sixth or seventh (test ranking) team
 ham yahaan duniya kii number ek team ke rup main waapas aae hai or ham is viraasat ko aage badhanaa chaahate hai
 Kohli said that winning has become a 'passion' for his team
 unhone kaha, ‘agar aap dekho, to pichley match main antim wicket girane ke baad sabhi kii bhavanaaen saamne aa gayi, yahaan tak ki sabase kam bolne vaale khilaadiyon kii bhi
 Because we know that as a team, if you push in one direction, then things are right and it should be passion
 ’ kohli ne kaha, ‘agar yah junun he, to ek-do maichon main nahin rukegaa
 If this is the goal, it will stop in one or two matches

 malout main shanivaar ko yojit sangrur saansad bhagwant maan kii raily main aap or akali dal samarthakon ke bich takaraav ho jane se 10 log ghayal hue
 The police said the dispute took place when some young Akali activists objected to Bhagwant Mann's alleged criticism of senior SAD leaders Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Bikram Singh Majithia
 sangharsh kuch minuton tak chalata rahaa
 During that time, supporters of the rival party threw chairs at each other
 unhone daawa kiya ki ek akali kaaryakarta ne aarope lagaaya ki bhagwant maan harsimrat or majithia ke bare main galat baaten kar rah the or kuch kaaryakartaaon ne is par aapatti jataai
 He claimed that these were AAP supporters who quarreled with Akali supporters
 haalanki, aap kaaryakartaaon ne daawa kiya ki akali samarthakon kaa unke saath sangharsh hua
 AAP workers later raised anti-akali slogans and blocked the malout-delhi National Highway in protest against the rally being disrupted
 malout anajmandi main bhi patharav kii ghatana ke samachar mili hai
 The comments police pravaktaa ne bataaya, "haalanki, kisi bhi paksh ne ab tak koi shikaayat nahin darj karai he

 ) Baba Ramdev's merit has been questioned by the Congress
 ye sawaal haryana main unhen yoga or ayurveda kaa brands ambesder banaae jane par uthaaya gaya he
 Former Haryana government minister Sampat Singh Nebaba has asked the Haryana government to withdraw the decision, questioning the educational qualification of Ramdev
 baba ramdevne yoga main koi nai khoj kii he yaa nahin, sawaal ye nahin he
 Whether or not Baba Ramdev has given any new theory of yoga is also not a question
 baba ramdev ne yoga kii koi nai vidha pratipaadit kii he yaa nahin, sawaal ye bhi nahin he
 Or there is no such question
 sawaal ye uthaa he kibaba ramdeoco sarkaar ke brands ambesder ho sakate hai yaa nahin
 After all, what is the job of a brand ambassador? The brand ambassador promotes that particular brand or product
 uske prachaar prasar ke liye kaam karata he
 Explains and explains the product's features to its users
 chunki aam log uski baton par gaur karte hai yaa aankh moond kar yakeen karte hai isliye product logon main apni paith banaata he - or uskaa vistaar hota he
 Yes, these things do not apply to Baba Ramdev's knowledge of Ayurveda
 ye baat unke homosexuality ke ilaaj ke daawey par bhi lagu nahin hoti
 This does not apply to his claim of curing even AIDS
 toothpaste or chyavanprash se lekar unke tamaam product par bhi ye baat nahin lagu hoti
 The same does not apply to treatment tips suggested by Baba Ramdev or his associate Acharya Balakrishna
 baba ramdev ke product kaa standard kya he ye tay karne ke liye desh main maanya agenciyaan hai
 They are also authorized agencies to prescribe medicine to anyone or not - and they are the authority to investigate or take any action
 lekin iskaa matlab ye to nahin kibaba ramdev yoga or ayurveda ko pramot nahin kar sakate? yoga or ayurveda kii achchhai logon ko nahin bataa sakate
 Cannot encourage people to adopt Yoga and Ayurveda
 'brands ambesder' ke liye shaikshik yogyata kya honi chahie? ye yogyata koun tay kar saktaa he? ise tay karne kaa haq kise he? nishchit rup se ye adhikaar puri tarah us sanghathan yaa company kaa he jo kisi bhi vyakti ko apana yaa apane kisi product kaa brands ambesader banaati he
 Bollywood star Kareena Kapoor is the brand ambassador of 'alpenliebe 2 Choco Eclair'
 to kya unhen chocolate tester yaa chocolate mekking methd kaa kaa export hona chahie
 Cricket star Sachin Tendulkar is the brand ambassador of the famous German car company BMW
 ab kya tendulkar ko iske liye automobile export bhi hona padegaa?vaise sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko lekar vipaksh kii bayaanbaji uske hone kaa saboot he
 It is the right of the opposition to question the functioning of the government
 yoga desh ke liye koi nai cheez nahin thi
 There is hardly anyone in the country who does not know about yoga
 aisa bhi nahin ki baba ramdev se pehle yoga ko lekar tivi par koi kaarykram nahin dikhaaya gaya
 But the way Baba Ramdev took Yoga home to home
 yoga ko aam logon se joda
 Aroused interest in everyone towards yoga
 hajaaron logon kii rosemara kii jindagi kaa hissaa banaaya uskaa koi muqabla nahin he
 By the way, many institutions have given honorary doctorates to Baba Ramdev
 aise main unki schuli shiksha par sawaalon kaa koi khaas matlab nahin rah jaataa, sivaa siyaasi fitrat ke
 Gautam Gambhar, a former Indian cricket team's opener and bat batsman, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 mana ja rahaa he ki gambhir ko bijepi nai dilli kii seat se loksabhaa chunaav ladaa sakati he
 When journalists asked the current MP from New Delhi and Meenakshi Lekhi, who is claiming her claim on this seat, about her ticket being cut, she was shocked
 darasal, ek taraf do kendriya mantriyon ke maujuudagi main gambhir party bijepi main shaamil ho rahe the, vahiin duusari taraf bijepi kii ek ahm baithak chal rahi thi
 BJP leaders ranging from Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to Union Minister Dr
 Harsh Vardhan were present in the meeting
 baithak khatm hui or tikat bantwaare ko lekar minakshi lekhi se jab sawaal kiye gaye to wo tilamila gayi
 The future of the current mps of the state was being discussed in the meeting of Delhi Pradesh BJP office
 jahaan raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman rajya karyaalay main tikaton kii charchaa kar rahi thim
 After a long discussion on the candidates of Delhi, when the MP from New Delhi seat Meenakshi Lekhi came out, her attitude was very much different
 bijepi kii taraf se dilli ke saaton ummidavaaron ko lekar chayan prakriya antim daur main he
 There is speculation that Gautam Gambhir has been fighting for his New Delhi seat long before he joined
 media ko katghare main khadaa kiyasaansad minakshi lekhi bijepi kor cameti kii baithak se jab nikaleen tab unase gautam gambhir ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki bahut acchhee baat he, sab log tut-foot kar, sab taraf se hamaari party jwine kar rahe hai
 This means that our party is going to do well
 iske turant baad jab nai dilli seat se gambhir ko tikat milane ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone media ko kathghare main khadaa kar diya
 Meenakshi Lekhi said that those who are running the fake news media, stop it
 ummidavaar talash rahi he bijepibijepi kor cameti kii baithak ke baad dilli kii siton par teen-teen naam tay kar kendriya chunaav samiti ko bheje gaye hai
 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that the names of the seven mps of Delhi were discussed and the BJP will select the candidates under the democratic process
 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki dilli ke liye ham achche se acha ummidavaar dhund rahe hai or party naamon kaa elaan jald karegi
 Gautam Gambhir, who joined the Prime Minister-influenced Gautam BJP, said that he had taken the membership of BJP after being influenced by the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki gautam gambhir ke aane se bhartiya janata party ko bada phayda hoga or bijepi bhi gambhir kii pratibha kaa upyog karegi
 At the same time, on the question of getting tickets, Jaitley said that this decision will be made by the committee related to the Lok Sabha elections, the final decision has not been taken yet
 agar bhagdaud main akhbaar padhanaa bhul gaye hai yaa phir koi khabar miss ho gai ho to aapaki is pareshaani kaa samaadhaan hamaare paas he

 sipiai netaa brunda karaat ne aaj tak se exclusive baatcheet main army chif va ellection kamishan ke mudde par apni bebaak raay rakhi
 On the subject of Army Chief's statement by Sandeep Dixit, Karat said that the statement that Sandeep Dixit has given has been given in a special context, he has apologized for it so this matter should be abolished now
 iske alaawilection kamishnadwara sarkaar se apane liye avmaananaa kaa adhikaar maangane par brunda karaat ne kaha agar vastav main ellection kamishan ko lagata he ki uski pratishtha ko haani pahunchi he to ve court kaa rasta apana saktaa he
 But i do not think the Election Commission needs any such powers right now
 brunda karaatne army chif ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki kya centre sarkaar ne unhen is tarah ke betuke bayaan dene kaa pramaan patr diya hua he aae din wo kuch na kuch kehete rahete hai
 Army Chief who is trying to say i think it was absolutely wrong and this type of statement does not suit the Army Chief of our country at all
 is prakaar ke bayaanbazi se unhe bachanaa chahie
 When such statements are given, it is obvious that there will be 10 more questions and if they arise, then there can be objectionable statements, then it definitely hurts the credibility of the army and the credibility of the army chief
 isliye army chif ko khud par niyantran karnaa chahie
 He further said that you see that BJP leaders themselves make such wrong statements about Gandhi ji, when he himself makes such a bad statement then why BJP are silent on him
 ellection kamishan par raay:brunda karaat ne ellection kamishan ke madde par kaha ki ellection kamishan ke kya suzav he uski detail abhi tak hamaare paas nahin ai he lekin jitna maine abhi tak padhaa he is aadhaar par main yah samajhati hoon ki ellection kamishan content ke sandarbh main jo likh rahe hai, hamaari party nahin samajhati ki is samay vah bahut aavashyak he
 If there are really serious issues that the Election Commission considers to have damaged his reputation and hurt his credibility, then surely he can go to court
 chunaav ayog ke paas aage court kaa rasta maujuud he parantu mujhe nahin lagata ki chunaav ayog ko abhi aisi kisi shaktiyon kii zarurat he
 Everyone has the right to criticize in this country, but the question is that if the Election Commission understands that defamation is taking place in the realm of criticism then they can go to court

 ali ne kaha, ‘main nakvi ke ghar jane ko taiyaar hum yaa vah mere ghar aa sakate hai
 You can discuss the allegations leveled against me and give evidence
 yadi vah sahi hai to main suuli chadhane ke liye taiyaar hum
 Ali, who was also expelled from JDU before being expelled from BJP, claimed that "naqvi must have felt that my arrival would threaten his position in the party
" ’ ali ko bijepi main shaamil kiye jane se party ke bheetar hi asantosh paidaa ho gaya tha or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh bhi party ke is faisle se khush nahin tha

 Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Ali said that the allegations against him were totally baseless
 '
 
 
 So i will sit on the dharna outside Naqvi's house, Ally said that he and his entire family have been affected by the allegations leveled against him, so Naqvi should apologize or prove the charge

 Ali's wife said, 'I want to apologize to Naqvi within 24 hours, in which the reason for his statement was also written
 varanaa vah apane aaropon ke babat saboot pesh karen
 The former mp's wife said, "even after 24 hours if he fails to do so
" 
 
 to main unke ghar ke saamne dharne par baith jaaoongi
 If i had to be martyred for the truth, then i would be martyred outside Naqvi's house

 They have not received any reply so far
 ’ ali ne kaha, ‘hamane notice taiyaar kar liya he or mere vakil unhen notice thama denge
 i have challenged them and say this again today
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jhooth kii buniyaad hameshaa kamjor hoti he
 i was a Rajya Sabha member for six years, i was in JDU
 us vakt kisi ne kuch nahin kaha
 But the day i joined the BJP, Naqvi probably thought that people like me associated with the ground realities would become a threat to him

 Interest rate on Employees Provident Fund (EPF) raised to 8 in February
 65 fisadi karne kaa prastaav kiya gaya tha
 It is now reported that pf's proposed interest rate may be cut by half to one per cent due to losses from investment in IL&FS and other reasons
 vitt mantralay ne rate kii samiksha karne ke liye shram mantralay se kaha he
 According to Hindustan Times, interest rate reduction on PF is being considered for the financial year 2018-19
 vitt varsh 2017-18 ke dauraan pief par milane vaali byaaj dar 8
 55 per cent had hit a five-year low, but in February this year, the Modi government raised the interest rate to 8
 65 fisadi karne kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 This would benefit about 45 lakh people
 lekin iske bare main abhi tak koi adhisuchana nahin ai thi
 According to the news, now the Finance Ministry has objected to this proposal
 iske liye ek vajah pareshaani main chal rahi company IL&FS main pief fund ke nivesh ko bhi bataaya ja rahaa he
 According to the newspaper, in a letter sent to the Labor Secretary on 7 June, the Finance Minister said, "the calculation of interest rate fixed for EPFO subscribers is not in accordance with the provisions of the EPFO scheme Rules
 iske alaava IL&FS samooh main nivesh se bhi kuch nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Therefore, it is our advice to the Ministry of Labor and Employment to consider such a suitable rate of interest for the financial year 2018-19 so that the surplus remains with the EPFO
 'desh ke nijee kshetra ke karmchaariyon ke pief kaa prabandhan karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi sanghathan (EPFO) ke dwaara kiya jaataa he or byaaj dar par antim nirnay iske kendriya trustee board (CBT) ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It comes under the Ministry of Labor only
 sibiti kaa cheirperson shram mantri hota he or isamen centre va rajya sarkaron, majdoor unionon, udyog chambers ke pratinidhi shaamil hote hai
 Many members of the CBT are opposing this letter of the Finance Ministry
 unka kahana he ki ipiefo ke maamle main vitt mantralay koi dakhal nahin de saktaa kyonki vah sarkaar se koi anudaan nahin letaa
 Apart from this, if there is any loss due to investment in IL&FS, then the government is responsible for this, because the fund had allowed the investment in private companies
 haalanki ek sutara ne akhbaar ko yah bhi bataaya he ki pief par byaaj dar ghataane kii mukhya vajah IL&FS main hone vaale nivesh se nuksaan nahin he
 He says that epfo's investment in IL&FS is very low
 asal main pief kii byaaj dar choti bachat yojanaon or bank jamaa se bhi zyada he
 To keep them competitive it is necessary to keep the PF interest rate to a limit

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) October 27, 2017 Do not show secret superstars to children? The mistakes that Aamir did not expect were such a secret superstar in the box office, although Aamir khan-zaira Wasim's film, which was adorned with better storytelling and acting, got a lot of praise, but it proved to be a little weak in earning
 aamir kii pichhali film dangal ne opening de par (30 karod) jitani kamai kii thi, sikret superstar ko utana kamaane main chaar din kaa vakt lag gaya
 This is the worst opening of Aamir's films in the last few years
 yahaan tak ki 2011 main relies hui dhobi ghaat kaa bhi first de collection 2
 78 crore was close to Rs
 diwali ko bharat main kareeb 1100 screens par relies hui sikret superstar ne guuruuvaar ko 4
 80, Friday 9th
 30, shanivaar 8
 71, Sunday 8
 50 or somvaar ko 3
 05 crores earned
 is tarah bhartiya bazaar main film ne kul 34
 Collected 36 crores
 oversij main bhi somvaar tak film ne kareeb 20
 Collected up to Rs 22 crore
 film kaa bajet 40-50 karod ke bich kaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 However, the makers have not revealed anything about this
 golmaal ne 7 din main kamaaye 164 karod rupee, ye rahaa har din kaa collectionkya is vajah se mili asafalataa ?is baar aamir kai jagahon par chook gaye
 In reality, the film is a story of the struggle of 15-year-old Insia and her mother Najma, a victim of domestic violence
 lekin prachaar main sirf insiya kii kahani ko dikhaaya gaya
 Some believe that hiding Insia's mother's story during marketing proved fatal to the film
 kahani ko lekar logon main kanfusion bana
 The release of Diwali also proved to have an impact on the film's business
 mana ja rahaa he ki diwali ke hafte main logon kaa mood halki-phulki manoranjak film dekhnaa hota he
 It was not wrong for Secret Superstar to be released this week, with a spice-rich film like Golmaal Again making it a loss
 golmaal kii vajah se sikret superstar ko screens bhi kam mili
 a major reason for the film's weakening at the box office is that Aamir's character is not as tall as it should have been
 jaayra ne apane hisse behatar kaam kiya he jitani unase ummid thi, lekin film main aamir kii maujuudagi hi sabase zyada antertaning he
 The length of Shakti Kumar's character could have benefited the film in terms of earnings without damaging the story
 jammu kashmir main algaavvaadi netaaon ne golibari kii taaja ghatana main ek yuvak kii kathith hatya kii ninda karte hue rajya main yuvakon kii silsilewar hatya ke virodh main somvaar ko kashmir band kaa aahvaan kiya he
 The presidents of both the factions of the Hurriyat Conference, led by Saeed Ali Shah Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, made separate calls on Monday to call off Kashmir in protest against the serial killing of the youths
 nurbagh ilaake main aaj us vakt hinsa bhadak gai jab bheed ne siarpief ke ek asthaayee ‘bunker’ main aag lagane kii koshish kii, jis vajah se addhasainik bal ke javaanon ko golibari kerani padi
 In this incident, a youth named Javid Ahmed Malla was killed and four other people were injured
 is bich makapa kii pradesh ikai ne sarkaar se shantipurna pradarshnakariyon se nibatane ke dauraan sanyam baratane kii apil kii he
 CPI State Secretary MY Tarigami today said, "I appeal to the administration to exercise restraint while dealing with the protesters
" ’’ unhone kaha ‘‘main logon se bhi yah apil karata hum ki ve apni shikayaton ko prakat karte samay shantipurna pradarshan karen tathaa hinsaatmak kadam uthaane bachein

 Let's listen to his story as his own: playing for my inspiration and proving his importance in an Indian team full of talented players, there is no greater motivation for me

 Today i feel very relaxed

 This time, BJP leader Kirti Azad has given a befitting reply to Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh
 parikrama ko lekar congress netaa ke twit par unhone kaha, 'digvijay singh sathia gaye hai
 Earlier Digvijay Singh tweeted, 'match fix in Ayodhya ?
 iske jawaab main bihar ke darbhanga se bijepi saansad kirti aaazaad ne kaha, 'digvijay singh sathia gaye hai
 He is older than me, what he wants to say in 'match Fixing in Ayodhya'
 vah is mudde par raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 'he said,' Just as the Muslims take out the Tajiya, the Hindus revolve around it, Digvijay finds the match fix because he does not want harmony
 ' Digvijay Singh, general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh affairs in the Congress, expressed full confidence in the party's victory in the assembly elections to be held there next year, saying that the party would not form an electoral alliance with any major political party in the state
 singh ne samvaadadaataaon ke sawaalon ke jawaab main kaha ki ham uttarapradesh main nishchit rup se agali sarkaar banane ja rahe hai or agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party jaise kisi bhi bade raajnneetik dal se chunavi gathjod nahin karenge

 It is noteworthy that Khatri had asked Sonia to remove Singh from the charge of Uttar Pradesh for his irresponsible statements that if it is not implemented soon, the party is ready to bear the brunt of it in the coming assembly elections

 tab se logon ke yahaan bijli ke bill bahut zyada bad gaye hai
 The shocking thing is that electricity prices were raised in Delhi by crying the losses of the power companies, but the report of Power Finance Corporation Limited itself shows that the companies were shown a profit of nearly three and a half crores
 sawaal yah he ki phir dilli main bijli kii daron main betahasha badhotaree kyon kii gai
 People are on the streets in Delhi for electricity bills

 But it is no wonder that these three power companies had a profit of nearly three and a half crores in 2010-11

 Chidambaram's problems have increased
 upie sarkaar main pi chidambaram kii badi bhoomika main thi
 By the way, Chidambaram's political journey so far has been fantastic
 1996 main pehali baar pi chidambaram ko vitt mantralay mila tha
 But this government did not last long
 lekin chidambaram ko apekshit raajnneetik pahchaan mil gai, uske baad saal 2004 main upie kii sarkaar bani to dobaaraa pi chidambaram ko vitt mantralay saunpa gaya, is pad par vah 2008 tak bane rahe
 Whenever P
 Chidambaram got the responsibility of the Finance Ministry, he tried to give results more than expected
 isi kaaran jab saal varsh 2012 main pranab mukherjee raashtrapati ban gaye to ek baar phir vitt mantralay kaa jimmaa pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne pi chidambaram ko saunp di
 As Finance Minister, Chidambaram first presented the budget on 28 February 1997
 vah kul 6 baar bajet pesh kar chuke hai
 In the 1997 budget, Chidambaram made changes in the ongoing tax for people and companies
 companiyon ko pehle se bhugte gaye em
 a
 tii ko aane vaale saalon main kar dendariyon main samyojit karne kii chhot de di gai
 The Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme (VDIS) scheme was launched to bring out black money
 pi chidambaram ke is kadam se logon ne khud se hi apni aay kaa khulaasa karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 During 1997-98, the government received Rs 18 thousand seven hundred crore from personal income tax, while between April 2010 and January 2011, this income reached above one lakh crore
 chidambaram ko hi diarect benifit transfar (DBT) kaa shrey jaataa he
 After that the budget presented in 2005 by P
 Chidambaram is considered historical
 pi chidambaram ne 28 farvari 2005 ko bajet main pehali baar rashtriya gramin rojgaar yojana (naregaa) ko pesh kiya
 Even today, the Congressmen themselves take credit for the success of MNREGA
 naregaa se gramin kshetra main rojgaar or aamadani kaa nayaa jariya khul gaya
 With this, large scale bureaucracy was encouraged in the country
 panchayat, gaanv or jila str par naukarshahon kaa jaal bich gaya
 Significantly, Chidambaram is accused of taking a bribe for illegally sanctioning INX Media from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board
 is cese main abhi tak chidambaram ko court se kareeb do darjan baar antarim protection yani giraftaar par roak kii raahat mili hui he
 The case dates back to 2007, when p Chidambaram was the Finance Minister
 jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne jammu main hue dohare aatanki hamalon kii ninda kii he
 Omar said that the purpose of the terrorists' attack is to influence the talks between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan
 umr ne kaha, 'bharat or pakistan ke pradhanmantriyon ke bich hone vaali baatcheet ko prabhavit karne ke liye ye hamale kiye gaye hai
 It is clear that the goal of the terrorists is to derail the indo-pak dialogue
 is hamale se vaarta ko lekar pradhanmantri par raajnneetik dabaav badhegaa
 The Prime Minister and his advisors have to see how to solve this problem, but we are committed to solve it in a peaceful manner
 abhi tak is hamale main 12 log mar chuke hai
 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh said, "like India is facing terrorism, Pakistan and Bangladesh are not untouched by this
 ye hamaare padosi desh hai
 All countries need to fight unitedly against terrorism
 'digvijay singh ne aage kaha, 'iskaa samaadhaan yaa to vaarta he yaa jang
 We can also fight, but are never in favor of it
 loktantr main vaarta hi ekmaatr samaadhaan he
 After Kargil, Atal Bihari Bajpai was in favor of peace talks with Pakistan when the NDA was in power
 'narendra modi ne bhi in hamalon kii ninda kii he
 Modi said, 'I strongly condemn the terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir
 in hamalon main shahid hue javaanon, pulisavaalon or aam nagarikon ke parivaar waalon ke saath meri sahanubhuti he
 At the same time RPN Singh said, 'it is sad that BJP is opposing talks with Pakistan
 wo itihaas bhul rahe hai, unhone bhi kargil ke samay vaarta kii thi
 BJP President Rajnath Singh said there
 'pradhanmantri ko pakistan se vaarta karne kii bahut jaldi he
 Until the environment improves, there should be no talk with Pakistan
 'sipiai netaa ne atul anjan ne kaha, 'ye hamale donon deshon ke liye kharaab hai
 Attacking the country in this way should stop them
 'congress netaa raashid alvi ne kaha, 'yah bahut dukhad he or main iskaa kadaa virodh karata hum
 Those involved in this should be punished
 kisi ko bhi dosha dene se pehle hamen sahi jaankaree kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 i believe the truth will come out
 ham aise hamale bardaasht nahin kar sakate hai
 We should not hold talks with the Prime Minister of Pakistan
 'bijepi netaa yashavanth sinha ne bhi pakistan ke pradhanmantri ke saath vaarta kaa virodh kiya he
 At the same time, BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, 'if Congress, its government is putting more power in disposing of nationalists, it would not be a day to see if half of its power was used to eliminate terrorism

 Dabi arrived here on Friday with her parents and relatives
 shaadi ke baad rishtedaaron ke saath kapal atahar ke anantnag sthit paitruk gaanv gaye
 Let me tell you that Dabi is a resident of Delhi
 report ke mutabik, dilli ke personal and training department ke ek kaarykram main 11 may 2015 ko donon kii mulaakaat hui thi or donon pyaar main pad gaye
 Many people said about the love of both of them that even though Athar may have stopped topping the UPSC, he has won Dabi's heart
 bataa de ki donon ke is rishte ko hindu mahasabha waalon ne 'lav jihad' kaa naam diya tha

 agar hansanaa sehat ke liye acha he to ronaa bhi sehat ke liye kharaab nahin hota he
 The benefits of laughing are less than that of crying
 chaahe aap koi movie dekhakar ro rahe ho yaa phir pyaaj katate hue aapaki ankhon se aansu aa jate hon, ye aapaki sehat ke liye achche hai
 There are also three types of tears, reflexive, contagious, emotional, do you know that only humans can cry in the third way
 imotional kring bahut hi phydemand he
 how? Let's know - crying makes you feel good
 In a recent study in the Netherlands, some people were shown a sad movie, after which the people who watched the film and those who didn't cry were divided separately
 kuch logon par bhaavnaatmak taur par koi asar nahin hua jabaki kuch log buree tarah roe
 However, within 20 minutes the crying people returned to normal and after 90 minutes the crying people were feeling better than those who did not cry
 rone se tanaav ghatata heljimer research centre rigens hospital foundation ke diarector, wiliam ech fre ne bhi pratibhaagiyon ko sad movies dikhaai
 According to William, we feel better after weeping because the chemicals that are produced during the stress are released
 hamen ye to nahin pataa ki ye chemicals koun se hote hai lekin aansuon main asitech hota he jo tanaav ke dauraan badhata he
 According to Fr
, it is necessary that we cry occasionally
 isse tanaav kam hota he or heart or mastishk ko kshati nahin pahunchati he
 We should not stop our children from crying
 hamen khush hona chahie ki unke andar yah kshamta he
 Eyes are safe from tears
 Healthy benefits are also from crying without getting emotional
 jab aap pyaaj katate hai to pyaaj se ek rasayan nikalataa he or ankhon kii sataha tak pahunchataa he
 This produces sulfuric acid
 isse chhutkaaraa paane ke liye aansu granthiyaan aansu nikaalati he jisase ankhon tak pahunchaa rasayan dhul jaataa he
 Tears also contain lysozyme which is antibacterial and anti viral
 glucose se ankhon kii sataha kii koshikaayen majboot hoti hai
 Tears clean the nose; tears reach the nasal pass through the lacrimal ducts within the body, which clears the dirt stored in the nose
 rone ke dauraan aksar naak bahane lagati he jiske peeche yahi vajah he
 Crying removes bacteria and dirt stored in the nose
 doctor fre ke mutabik, mahilaayein maheene main ausatan 5
 3 times cry while men average 1
 3 baar hi rote hai
 The reason for this difference is that men have testosterone while women have a hormone called prolactin which causes them to cry
 doctor fre ke mutabik, aansu granthiyaan purushon or mahilaon kii aansu granthiyon main bhi antar hota he
 But the biggest reason why men do not cry is sexual and cultural, which deprives men of the benefits of crying
 
 Doctor Orloff says, "one should get out of the illusions about crying
 ronaa swasthya ke liye acha he, or yah purushon or mahilaon donon kii sehat ke liye hi acha hota he

 shanivaar ko court ne alji or dilli sarkaar ke nunatam mazdooree badhaane ke faisle ko radd kar diya tha, lekin aaj court ne swat: sangyaan lete hue kaha he ki koi bhi factory maalik yaa industry badaye hue paise ko mazdooron se waapas nahin maang sakate

 Bollywood has long had a craze for making a biopic

 lekin isse bhi bada sarprise ye he ki is role ko sani leone karengi
 According to media reports, after the success of 'tumhari Sulu', writer and director Karan Razdan has approached Sunny Leone for Meena Kumari's biopic
 sani ko script bhi pasand ai he, magar wo puri tarah se abhi raji nahin hai
 From Sunny Leone to GST, people kept searching that Karan had approached Vidya Balan and Madhuri Dixit for this film earlier
 lekin vidya ko script samaj main nahin ai or maadhuri ne iske liye hami nahin bhari
 It remains to be seen whether Sunny is the finalist for this project
 vaise unke liye ye project karnaa itnaa aasaan bhi nahin hoga, kyonki hindi bolne main unhen abhi tak kaaphi dikkatein aati hai
 Second, his glamorous style does not fit much with Meena Kumari's legend role

 rashtrapita mahatma gandhi ke pautra rajmohan gandhi ne shanivaar ko kaha ki 'british sheron' or desh main 'sampradayik jehar vaale sanpon' par jeet hasil karne vaala shaks 'chatur baniyaa' se kahin adhik tha
 Gandhi is currently in the US
 unhone kaha ki aaj mahatma kaa lakshya bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah se kahin alag hota
 Shah had yesterday described Mahatma Gandhi as a 'clever baniya' at a meeting in Raipur
 jeevanikar or america ke ilinoy vishvavidhyalay main shodh professor gandhi ne i-mail ke jariye bheje gaye jawaab main kaha, "jis vyakti ne british sheron or sampradayik jehar vaale sanpon par jeet hasil kii, vah chatur baniyaa se kahin adhik tha
 Unlike people like Amit Shah, his goal today would be to defeat the powers that have been hunting innocent and vulnerable people
 ’’ shah ke 'chatur baniyaa' vaale bayaan kii ninda karte hue vipakshi partiyon ne aaj maang kii ki unhen desh se maafee maangani chahie
 At the same time, the opposition parties insisted that the derogatory statement should be withdrawn
 mahatma gandhi ke ek anya pautra gopalkrishna gandhi ne bhi kaha ki gandhi 'chatur baniyaa' bataaye jane ko hans kar taal dete parantu yah tippanee ‘‘badmaja he or iske peeche chhipi galat manshaa' he
 Significantly, BJP President Amit Shah has given rise to political controversy by referring to the word 'very clever Baniya' for him in the context of Mahatma Gandhi's caste
 congress or anya dalon ne rashtrapita kaa apmaan karne ke liye shah ko maafee maangane ko kaha
 However, Shan has categorically refused to apologize
 tippaniyan Shah, while addressing a group of enlightened citizens in Raipur yesterday, mentioned the Baniya caste in which Mahatma Gandhi was born
 unhone kaha tha, "mahatma gandhi doordarshee hone ke saath hi bahut 'chatur baniyaa' the
 He knew what was going to happen next
 unhone aazaadee ke baad turant kaha tha ki congress ko bhang kar diya janaa chahie
 This work was not done by Mahatma Gandhi but now some people are working to dissolve the Congress
 " unhone kaha ki mahatma gandhi ne aisa isliye kaha tha kyonki congress kii sthapana vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par nahin hui thi
 It was like a 'special purpose undertaking' to achieve independence in a way
 aalochana kaa saamana karne ke baad bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya aghyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki sabhi jaanate hai ki unhone kis sandarbh main yah baat kahi he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Gandhi, a biographer and research professor at the University of Illinois at the United States, said in an e-mail reply, "the man who won over British lions and communal poisoned snakes was more than a shrewd baniya
 amit shah jaise logon ke vipareet aaj unka lakshya nirdosh or kamjor logon kaa shikaar kar rahi shaktiyon ko parajeet karnaa hota
 Condemning Shah's statement as 'clever banias', opposition parties today demanded that they should apologize to the country
 saath hi vipakshi dalon ne is baat par jor diya ki apmanjanak bayaan ko waapas liya janaa chahie
 Gopalkrishna Gandhi, another grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, also said that Gandhi laughed off being called a 'clever baniya', but the remark was "badass and there is a false intention behind it"
 gauratlab he ki bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii jati ke sandarbh main unke liye ‘bahut chatur baniyaa’ shabd kaa ullekh kar rajnatik vivaad ko janm de diya he
 The Congress and other parties asked Shah to apologize for insulting the father of the nation
 haalanki, shaan ne maafee maangane se saaf inkaar diya he
 The comments shah ne raipur main kal prabud nagarikon ke ek samooh ko sambodhit karte hue, mahatma gandhi kaa jis baniyaa jati main janm hua tha uskaa ullekh kiya tha
 He had said, "mahatma Gandhi was a very 'clever baniya' besides being a visionary
 unhen maaloom tha ki aage kya hone vaala he
 He had said immediately after independence that the Congress should be dissolved
 yah kaam mahatma gandhi ne nahin kiya lekin ab kuch log congress ko bhang karne kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 "he said that Mahatma Gandhi had said this because the Congress was not founded on the basis of ideology
 yah ek tarah se aazaadee hasil karne ke liye ‘vishesh uddeshy upkram’ sareekha tha
 After facing criticism, Bharatiya Janata Party national president Amit Shah said that everyone knows in what context he said this
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) mahatma gandhi ke ek anya pautra gopalkrishna gandhi ne bhi kaha ki gandhi 'chatur baniyaa' bataaye jane ko hans kar taal dete parantu yah tippanee ‘‘badmaja he or iske peeche chhipi galat manshaa' he
