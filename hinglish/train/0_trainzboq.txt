 But the fair of Sonepur has also been gaining fame in recent times regarding the theater
 theatre main ashleelata ko lekar sawaal uthte rahen he lekin iske baavjood sonpur main ek darjan se zyada theatre har saal lagate hai
 This year, the Saran administration agreed to give licenses to theaters, saying that theaters spread pornography
 wo bhi tab jab theatre sara-sajo saamaan sonpur meley main laga chuke the, karodon rupaye kharch ho chuke hai, ab prashasan se license nahin milane ke kaaran saare theatre or usamen kaam karne vaali ladkiyaan sadakon par hai

 In spite of this, there is obscenity in the eyes of the SP, then who is responsible for it
 isaki vajah yahi bhi ho sakati he ki prashasan uskithik se nigaraneenhin kar paa rahaa he
 On the other hand, if the SP of Saran saw the danger of obscenity, then they should not have given permission to set up the theater in advance
 lekin jab theatre kaa stage saj chukaa he, sainkadon ladkiyaan pahunch chuki hai, tab prashasan ke is faisle par hangaamaa hona to tay tha

 Former Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister and SP leader Azam Khan has been caught making extremely objectionable statements on the army
 ab ajam khan ne apane bachaav main kaha he ki maine sena par rape kaa aarope nahin lagaaya he
 My statement is incorrectly taken
 maine akhbaar main chhapi khabaron ke aadhaar par apni baat rakhi
 Significantly, there were reports of cutting of private parts of the martyred security personnel in Naxalite attacks in Sukma, Chhattisgarh recently
 ajam khan ne kaha ki desh kaa dalit-musalmaan pareshaan he
 i have become an item girl of fascist forces

 BJP gets votes by spreading hatred against me

 Actually Azam Khan had said that women were beaten up by soldiers in Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki kashmir main mahilaon ne phogiyon ke ang kaat liye
 In Assam and Jharkhand, women have beaten up soldiers
 unhone kaha ki modi raaj main desh raah se bhatak gaya he

 He sometimes states that victory was won only by Muslims

 Sambit Patra described him as an agent of ISI
 sapa se nishkasit purv pravaktaa deepak mishra ne kaha ki ajam ko aisa nahin kahana chahie
 By giving such a statement, the trust of the army starts to weaken
 unhen is tarah kaa vivaadit bayaan nahin dena chahie
 Addressing the workers at the SP Camp office in Rampur district, Azam said that the biggest political movement in our life is that of Babri Masjid Ram Janmabhoomi, which even today Hindustan is paying the price and perhaps its payment is not going to end easily
 
 ajam khan ne kaha ki hindustan kaa maahaul sabase zyada badanaseeb or nindaneey he
 He said that now India is moving out of its way

 Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan has now decided to become the next Prime Minister of Pakistan
 pakistan ke aam chunaav ke abhi tak aae rujhaanon main imran khan kii pakistan taharik-e-insaaf party sabase badi party banakar ubhartee dikh rahi he
 Apart from this, it will be the first time in the world, when a cricketer will become the Prime Minister of a country
 vaise imran khan ke liye yahaan tak kaa safar tay karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Imran Khan founded the Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf Party in 1996 after establishing his reign in cricket
 pehali baar unki party ko sirf ek hi seat par jeet mili thi
 However, he continued his struggle and finally the day came when Imran Khan's dream of becoming Prime Minister of nuclear-rich Pakistan would be fulfilled
 ab sawaal yah he ki aakhirimran khan kii jitki sabase badi vajahen kya thim? pakistan kii janata unako kyon pradhanmantri bananaa chaahati he? aaie jaanate hai pakistan ke chunaav main imran khan kii jeet ke kaaran
 
 
 
 
 1- Opening of corruption against the Sharif family Corruption is the biggest issue in the current politics of Pakistan
 imran khan ne apane chunavi abhiyaan ke dauraan bhrashtachar ke mudde ko jorshor se uthaaya
 Imran Khan's campaign was boosted by corruption cases against Sharif and the Bhutto family
 aam chunaav se thik pehle panama maamle main navaj sharif ko pradhanmantri kii kursi ganvaani padi or jail janaa padaa
 At the same time, there is no corruption case against Imran Khan
 unki chhavi kaaphi saaf suthri he, jiske chalate janata unki ore aakarshith hui
 2- Against dynasty, the Bhutto and Sharif families have been in power for a long time in the mandate of Pakistan
 sena ke varchasv ke baavjood in do pariwaron ne pakistan main sabase lambey samay tak raaj kiya
 Hence the public wanted to get rid of dynasty this time
 imran khan kii jeet ko vanshavaad ke khilaaf janadesh ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 3- Imran Khan's open support of army and radicals Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf party also got open support of army and fundamentalists in Pakistan's general election
 imran khan ko sena kii pehali pasand mana ja rahaa he
 That is why Imran Khan did not make any statement against the Pakistani army during the election and tried to capitalize on the statement of the other former PM Nawaz Sharif against the army
 imran khan ne navaj sharif par bayaanbaji karke sena ko kamjor karne kii koshish karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Apart from this, the leader of the radical organization harkat-ul-mujahideen and Fazlur Rahman Khalil of Al Qaeda also supported Imran Khan's party
 4- yuvaaon ko aakarshith karne main safal rahe imran khanpakistan ke yuvaaon main imran khan kaa kaaphi prabhaav he
 He is considered an icon of Pakistan cricket
 mahaj 13 saal kii umr se imran ne cricket khelnaa shuru kar diya tha, jiske baad pakistan ke liye apana debyue 1971 main birmingham main england ke khilaaf 18 saal kii umr main kiya
 He played the Pakistan cricket team from 1982-1992 while playing cricket for almost two decades
 itane lambey samay tak captain rahane vaale ve pehle ballebaaj hai
 He won Pakistan's first and only Cricket World Cup in 1992
 imran khan ko pakistan kaa sabase safal khilaadi or captain mana jaataa he
 5- Imran Khan, who managed to build and capitalize on the nationalist image, made his image as a nationalist leader in Pakistan
 deshhit se jude mudde par unhone khulkar apni baat rakhi
 Especially did not leave any chance of rhetoric against India
 unhone purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko bharat kaa laadla qaraar diya
 Imran Khan surrounded Nawaz Sharif fiercely on the issue of patriotism, which benefited him in the election
 unhone pakistan main america sena ke dakhal kaa bhi khulkar virodh kiya
 Apart from this, Imran Khan got Pakistan the first World Cup and then continued his social service after retiring from cricket
 6- yuvaaon ko dikhaaya vikaas kaa sapanimran khan ne chunaav ke dauraan yuvaaon ko vikaas kaa sapana dikhaaya
 He even said that if his government is formed, he will take Pakistan further than India
 vartmaan main pakistan main berogari or garibi bada mudda he
 Therefore, Imran Khan's promise of development impressed the youth

 gaanv main 40 varshiya jatin sareen kaa cricket ke balle banane vaala kaarkaana apane aap main ek mujium he
 Not only the 100 year old bats, but also those bats are present with which many of the world's leading batsmen have made many records
 sareen sports industries ke emdi jatin ke chaar acre main faile kaarkaane kii pehali manzil par unke daftar main aise balle deevaaron par tange hai
 Veteran player Virender Sehwag scored 309 runs with a bat adorned on one corner
 bich main vah balla bhi tanga he jisase srilanka ke kumaar sangakaara ne tihara shatak thoka tha
 Here is the record holder bat of Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly and also of Adam Gilchrist of Australia
 ballon kii baat chalate hi jatin kii ankhon main chamak aa jaati he
 He says very fondly, “earlier Indians used to play with the bat made by the whites, now the whites play with our bat
 ”desh ke bantwaare ke baad jatin ke dada pakistan se aakar meerut main bas gaye the
 In the fifties, he started making badminton shuttlecock
 lekin jatin ke pita en
 K
 sareen kii badminton main zyada dilchaspee nahin thi
 He was fond of playing cricket during college in those days
 unhone college str kii kai pratiyogitaaon main hissaa liya
 It was here that he thought of making cricket bats
 1969 main unhone apni company shuru kii or meerut main balle kaa kaarkaana kholaa
 The bats made by this company were known as "SS Bat"
 us dauraan duniya main do tarah kii lakdipoon “kashmir wilo” or “english wilo” se balle banaae jate the
 Only Kashmir willow was prevalent in India
 “english wilo” lakdi ke balle mahange the or unase keval amir hi khelte the
 N
 ke
 Sarin first imported "english Willow" wood from abroad and started making bats from it
 us jamaane main unhone saiyad kirmani or roger binni se anubandh kiya jo inke banaae balle se cricket khelte the
 After this Manoj Prabhakar started playing with his bats and Vinod Kambli scored a double century against England in 1993 while playing with the bat made from the same company
 eses bats kaa nayaa daur us vakt shuru hua jab en
 K
 sareen ke bete jatin ne 1997 main balla banane kaa kaam apane haath main liya
 After graduating from Meerut College, he went to England to learn the tricks of bat making
 us vakt england main jon newtori ke banaae balle duniya main mashhoor the
 He spent almost a year with John Neubri and learned from him all the nuances needed to make a world-class bat
 jatin ne meerut lautne ke baad tendulkar, ganguli samet kai cricket khiladinnon ke saath kaaphi vakt bitaayaa
 Based on the suggestions received from these players, they started the practice of making 40 mm thicker bats in place of thinner bats of 28 mm width in the country and made the handle of these bats with a special technique so that they have flexibility
 cricket ball par prahaar karne main “english wilo” lakdi ke bane in ballon kaa jawaab nahin tha
 The ball collided with them and went far and fast
 in ballon ke nirmaan ke liye jatin ne apane karmchaariyon ko khud hi vishesh training di
 Soon these thick bats became the choice of players like Tendulkar and Ganguly
 shuru main 100-150 balle roj banate the, ab rojaanaa kareeb 700 balle banate hai
 Whenever Tendulkar played good cricket, he definitely got "ton" (ie 100) written on his bat
 “ton” eses bat kaa hi ek brands he jise en
 K
 sareen ne '70 ke dashak main register karvaa liya tha
 When Tendulkar completed 35 centuries, the world famous company "oakley" gave him 35 glasses as a gift
 inamen se 27wein number kaa chashma tendulkar ne ek aabhaar patr ke saath jatin ko bhi bhent kiya
 After 2007, when T20 cricket started, the demand for a lighter SS bat on Mote got a boost
 puma, adidas, niki jaisi antarrashtriya companiyon ne jatin se hi balle banavaane shuru kiye
 The technology of "mangus", the most revolutionary bat of world cricket, was made in England but it was made in Jatin's factory in Meerut
 yah khaas tarah kaa balla chota tha par iskaa handle lanbaa tha
 Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden spoke highly of the "mangus" bat in the IPL
 jatin ne 2006 main nayaa kaarkaana kholaa, jahaan zyaadaatar haath se balle banaae jate hai
 700 here
 se lekar 25,000 ru
 Priced bats are made
 aaj viraat kohli or england ke ravi bopaara samet 50 se zyada antarrashtriya khilaadi eses bat se hi khelte hai
 There are dealers of this bat in more than four dozen countries
 jatin ne eses bat ko nakalchiyon se bachaane ke liye pehali baar ballon par neon stikar kaa istemaal shuru kiya he
 It is Jatin's charm that SS Bat is making the country iron in world cricket

 Earlier, Sonia Gandhi had told Manmohan Singh that the ordinance is against public sentiment and public sentiment should be respected

 The two talked for 25 minutes

 The Dalit has left the Congress and the BJP

 He further said that the Congress remained in power at the Center and the state for a long time, but did nothing for the poor and farmers
 vanchiton ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 Due to its wrong policies, the Congress got out of power and now BJP is doing anti-common work
 isliye uske bhi din ab chale gaye
 BJP wants to rule society by dividing: In a joint rally with Akhileshmayavati, Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav said that the people of BJP want to rule by dividing the society

 aakhirkaarrampalko police ne dhar hi liya, baahar aate hi usne apana dukhada sunaaya ki samarthakon ne usapar mayajaal kar use andar band kar rakhaa tha
 When this excuse did not last, his real grief spilled over
 rampal ashramasirf isliye nahi chhod rahaa tha ki kahin uske ashram se nikalate hi peeche se robert wadra us par bhi kabja na kar len
 When the police entered the Satlok Ashram for search, looking at the cameras in the bathroom, at first they thought that they might have come on the sets of Bigg Boss, but as they proceeded to the ashram, similar 'supernatural' items were handed over to the police
 This is the ashram of some 'baba'
 satalok ashramase jo baaten nikal kar baahar ai hai usame sab se khaas baat ye thi ki rampal jis doodh main snaan karata usee doodh main baantne ke liye kheer banati thi, bharat or pakistan ke rishte kabhi is kaaran se bhi nahi sudhar sakenge, kyonki ye baat saamne aane ke baad pakistaniyon ko ‘kashmir maangoge to cheer denge’ ke saath-saath ‘doodh maangoge to kheer denge’ se bhi chidh hone vaali he
 The terrorist organizations sitting in Pakistan also kept an eye on this whole matter
 pehle to wo khush the ki 26 / 11 ke baad kisi ne pehali baar itane ghanton tak ek puure raashtra ke khilaaf yuddh kaa maahaul banaae rakhaa or duusari baat jo is maamle main aatankiyon kii dilchaspee kii vajah bani wo aatanki sanghathanon kii khasta mali haalat thi
 Alam is that in the last days when there was a terrorist attack on the bagha-attari border of Pakistan, three-three terrorist organizations took responsibility for a blast
 hindustan main hokar agar koi aise jimmedaari lene ko khaali baitha hota to jarur use party vishesh kii roj hone vaali haar kii jimmedaari lene ke kaam par laga diya jaataa par afsos pakistan main unki koi puch parakh nahin hui
 There is a big interest in terrorist organizations eager to brainwash their crispy Mali condition with devotees and improve new skills from Rampal's disciples
 tech diggaj google ne apane do flagship smartphone Pixel or Pixel XL launch kiye hai
 We have explained in detail about these two smartphones
 lekin ab ham aapako ye bataaenge ki bhartiya bazaar main ye donon smartphone flop sabit honge
 Price The basic variant of Google Pixel i
e
 32GB internal memory is priced at Rs 57,000
 yah ek tathy he ki zyaadaatar bharat kii janata agar 50 hajaar se upar ke smartphone kharidne kaa man banaati he to sabase pehle wo Apple ke iphone ko tavajjo detii he
 Because currently iphone is one of the best smartphones in the world and it is also a status symbol
 kai iphone yugers ko hamane yah kehete suna he ki chaahe samsung kaa 50,000 kaa smartphone kharid lo, lekin saamne vaale ko isaki keemat bataani hoti he
 People see the iphone from a distance and understand that it will be an expensive smartphone
 iphone 7 launch ho gaya he or jald hi yah 60,000 rupee kii shuruaati keemat ke saath bharat main milanaa shuru hoga
 In such a situation, people will want to buy iphone 7 after applying 3,000 more
 limited storaclefidel or Pixel XL main memory card lagaakar iske storage ko nahin badha sakate hai
 Although the company has provided unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos, it is not practical for India
 yahaan mobile internet kii sthiti bad se badtar he
 High speed internet is required to save HD content to the cloud
 zyaadaatar janata ke paas hai speed internet kaa acces nahin he
 These smartphones are not water proof
 If you buy smartphones above 50,000, then obviously you will also see whether the smartphone you are going to get is water proof or not
 samsung or soni jaisi duusari companiyaan ab apane hai and bajet smartphone water pruf bana rahi hai
 This time Apple too has realized it and made the iphone 7 water proof
 jaahir he janata yphone kii taraf hi bhaagegi
 These features will also be found in other Android smartphones
 Google announced its Google Assistant during its launch

 Google Assistant will replace Google Now and it will work on your voice or written commands
 artificial intelligence besd yah feechar google ke ap elo main bhi diya gaya he jo kaaphi behatarani he isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Prevacy problem: Inbuilt Google Assistant in this smartphone means that it will record your routine
 aap kya karte hai, kahaan jate hai, kisase baat karte hai or kya order karte hai aisi tamaam jaankaree iske paas rahengi
 However, if you do not use Google Assistant, then it will be avoided
 lekin is smartphone kii khaasiyat hi yahi he
 Edward Snowden has refused to let people use Google's new app Alo in which Google Assistant has been given
 unka kahana he ki google ke liye yah logon kii jaankaree ikattha karne kaa ek tul maatr he
 But will Indian users pay such a huge amount just for Google Assistant and cloud storage? The Nextbit Robin smartphone with 100GB cloud storage is also in the market, which is half the price

 But the problem is that until these crimes are properly investigated by the police, it cannot be ascertained how many more girls are still in the grip of these smugglers

 However, along with this, the Ministry of Skill has also started taking action on such fake centers
 ye karrwai NDTV kii us report ke baad hui he jisamen dikhaaya gaya tha ki kis tarah kai farzi centre chal rahe hai
 However the problems of the original franchise centers were also introduced in that report
 NDTV kii khabar ke baad kaushal mantralay ne apane bayaan main kaha, ''frenchizi centaron ko kaam na dene kaa faisalaa sirf kuch dinon ke liye he baad main sabhi ko merit par kaam diya jayega
 Simultaneously, the work of quota of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana has been given, but still arrangements will be made for the remaining centers
 '' tippaniyan NDTV showed on 29 June 2017 how the NSDC (national Skill Development Council) had given work to the fake centers in violation of the rules while the centers passed by NSDC were not being given work
 us report main kuch aise centre dikhaae gaye the joki NSDC kii website par to hai par jab ja kar padtaal kii gai to paaya gaya ki wo centre vahaan hai hi nahin jaise NSDC kii website par dikhaaya ja rahaa tha
 For example, a center called SPEJ wellness is running at the address of Greater Noida where the work of beautician should have been taught, but it was found in NDTV that there is no such center but the children's hostel is running at the address given on the website 
 padtaal main is tarah ke kai or centre bhi mili the
 However, despite the assurance from the Ministry of Skill, the franchise center owners demonstrated in front of the ministry on Friday and this time also brought applications seeking permission to commit suicide

 In that report, some such centers were shown which are on the website of NSDC but when it was investigated, it was found that those centers were not there as was being shown on the website of NSDC

 Federalism was the fundamental principle of Gandhian ideology when Mahatma Gandhi changed the Congress opinion from the manifesto of revolution to a constantly evolving sanad in the 1930s
 1930 main lahore main swatantraaa kaa prastaav paarit karne ke baad congress ko apana dhyey badalane kii jarurat ho gai thi; aazaadee kaa matlab angrejon kii ravaanagi hi nahin tha
 The party also needed to draw a blueprint for a new independent India

 uski har tili baraabar thi or sarkaar chalaane kii jimmedaari rajyon par thi
 The first generation of leaders did not abolish this doctrine after 1947, but if they were apprehensive of its consequences after the bitter experience of Partition, they could not be blamed for it

 On April 30, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) issued an order asking it to explain the modalities for implementing the Cable Television Networks (regulation) Amendment Act, December 2011
 aadesh kii ek vivaadaaspad dhara ne broadcasting bijness khaastaur se tivi news ko mushkil main daal diya he
 This poses the risk of imposing a good law or reform
 2011 ke is kanoon kaa mukhya makasad he ki cabel televijan network ek tay samay avadhi ke bheetar puraani analog technology kii bajaay nai digital technology ko apanaaen
 The deadline for the four metro cities of the country is July 2012
 jabaki puure desh main ise saal 2014 tak lagu karnaa he
 Changing technology will relieve cable networks in terms of capacity, due to which they are currently able to broadcast a limited number of channels
 analog signal system main kisi ek channel ke prasaaran ke liye 7-8 megahertz bandwidth kii jarurat hoti he jabaki digital system main itani hi bandwidth par 10-15 channelon ko prasaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 In a digital system, viewers will have far more options in terms of channels watched
 digitigeshan se darshakon ko behatar pikchar quality or haai definishan jaisi sahuuliyat milegi
 Also the sound quality will also be better
 kshamta main 10-15 guna ijaphe se industry ko kaarobaar aage badhaane main madad milane kii ummid he
 It was expected that digitization would get rid of broadcasters' forced feature-carriage fee of older systems
 broadcasters ko multi system operators (emesao) ko bhugtan karnaa hota he
 For instance, Hathaway, which owns major cable networks across the country and serves as the Digicable franchisee to the cable operators of the locality and carries their signals to homes
 chunki, emesao kii signal transmit karne kii kshamta simit hoti he, aise main karij fees ek tarah kii pratispardhi boli prakriya he jo ki is baat ko sunishchit karti he ki broadcaster kaa channel darshakon tak pahunche
 The section of the TRAI order states that instead of removing the carriage fee, it is permitted to maintain it
 karij fees broadcasters kaa vittiya boj badhaane vaali he, khaastaur se news channelon kaa, jo nickshulk apni sevaaon kaa prasaaran karte hai
 As per the sections of the order, the authority has decided that every MSO can fix a carriage fee
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki digital adresseeble cabel tivi system lagu karne main multi system operataron ke kiye gaye bade nivesh or channelon kii karij cast ke boj ko broadcasters bhi saajha karen
 The News Broadcasters Association (NBA) is very angry about this order
 association ne 1 may ko jari bayaan main kaha he ki yah karij fees broadcasters ko galat tareeke se dandit karti he or isse broadcasting industry ke saamne astitv kaa sankat khadaa ho gaya he
 Time Broadcasting CEO Sunil Lulla estimates that carriage fees are around Rs 2,500-3,000 crore every year
 padati he
 He says that half of this amount is paid by news broadcasters
 enditivi ke agxcutive vaais chairman or enbie ke president keviel narayan raav kaa kahana he ki ''karij fees kisi news broadcaster kii kul laagat ke 30 fisadi ke baraabar tak ho sakati he
 In such a situation it is a big burden
 is rakam kaa istemaal content sudhaarney main kiya ja saktaa he
 Like other broadcasters, Rao is hoping to eliminate carriage fees
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki yah act puri tarah se cabel operataron ke paksh main he
 But the operators do not agree
 emesao alliance ke president ashok mansukhani kaa kahana he ki nai technology lagu karne kii puri laagat bhala akele operators hi kaise uthaa sakate hai? 10 karod gharon ke liye isaki laagat kareeb 35,000 karod ru
 is
 unka tark he chunki digitigeshan kaa phayda broadcasters ko bhi hoga, aise main unhen bhi is boj ko saajha karnaa chahie
 He says that broadcasters, especially the NBA, are the most opposed to it
 lekin zyada darshak or majboot sabsakripshan base se use hi iskaa sabase zyada phayda hoga
 Both these things can be used to get more advertising revenue
 iskaa iklauta vikalp graahakon se ooncha shulk vasuulana he
 But Mansukhani does not want to pass on the increased burden to the customers
 tri kaa aadesh is tark ko sweekaar karte hue spasht karata he ki karij fees nai technology laane or multi system operataron kii kshamta badhaane par aane vaale kharch ko vahan kare, aisi use apeksha he
 TRAI Secretary Rajeev Aggarwal says, "we have not put additional financial burden on the broadcasters
 karij fees pehle se lee ja rahi he
 However, TRAI claims that it has made the system more transparent
 30 april ke aadesh main kaha gaya he ki har multi system oparator ek reference interconect ofer chhaapega
 In this, he has to give information about his carriage fees, which should be implemented in a uniform, non-discriminatory and transparent manner
 haalanki, lulla tri ke tark se asahmat hai
 He says that "if you are in a particular business, then you have to invest in it
" us nivesh kaa boj bhala dusron par kyon daalaa janaa chahie?''agarwal maanate hai ki jab broadcasters ko apni har raay rakhane kaa adhikaar he to aise main kisi tarah kaa vivaad nahin hona chahie
 He argues that as the capacity of multi-system operators increases, their bargaining capacity associated with carriage fees will decrease
 unka kahana he, ''maujuuda samay main ve karij fees le sakate hai kyonki abhi unki kshamta bahut simit he
 We have made it mandatory to increase capacity (200 to 500 channels on average)
 unka kahana he ki kshamta badhaane ke baad unhen channels ke paas janaa hoga or signal maangane honge
 Then the strength of the multi system operators to influence the market will be limited
 '' lekin raav in baton se aashwast nahin hai
 Lulla says that the guidelines have not been prepared with full details
 aise main agar multi system operataron ko karij fees kaa bhugtan nahin kiya jaataa he to ve channel kaa prasaaran karne se manaa kar sakate hai

 endie main bijepi kii pramukh sahyogi shivasena ne narendra modi kaa bachaav karte hue congress par hamalaa bolaa he
 The Shiv Sena has said in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'saamana', 'the Congress party has lost its mind
 desh ke andar ghatane vaali har ghatana or bhavishya kii sari ghatnaon kaa thikra modi ke sir phoda ja rahaa he
 Significantly, Union Minister Kapil Sibal accused Modi of making inflammatory speeches and creating communal atmosphere in Assam
 shivasena kaa kahana he, 'jab assam main bangladeshi musalamaanon kii hatya hoti he to sonia gandhi vahaan aashwaasan dene turant pahunch jaati hai lekin jab kashmir main kisi hindu ko maaraa jaataa he to sonia to dur kapil sibbal jaise netaa bhi nahin pahunchate
 Targeting Sibal, the Shiv Sena party said, "modi means 'model of Dividing India' according to Kapil Sibal
" jabaki ye baat congress par lagu hoti he
 Break, tear and rule, thanks to this policy of the British, the Congress has ruled so far
 'shivasena ne centre kii upie sarkaar main congress ke sahyogiyon par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki sirf kapil sibbal hi nahin, balki jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri ne bhi assam kii ghatana ke liye modi ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 The editorial states, 'kashmiri Pandits have to flee due to the continuous violence in Kashmir
 uski chintaa karne kii bajaay, umr abdulla ko is baat kii chintaa he ki assam main bodo andolankaaree bangladeshi musalamaanon ko goli maar rahe hai
 After May 16, Congress' Shiv Sena will be in madhouse, said that the mental balance of Congress people has been disturbed
 16 may ke nateezon ke baad inhen mental hospital main bhartee karnaa pad saktaa he
 The editorial said, "modi is breaking the country, the allegation is as if foreigners have climbed up and pick up finger on the smell coming from other's mouth
 sawaal sirf assam kaa nahin he, balki puure desh ke astitv kaa he
 The Shiv Sena says that Bhoomiputra Bodo tribals of Assam are deeply troubled by Bangladeshis who have entered the country
 unki jameen chhini ja rahi he
 The Bodo tribals are fighting to save their land and lives, which the Congress feels guilty
 kashmir main jis tarah hinduon or kashmiri panditon ko palaayan karnaa padaa, thik usee tarah assam se bodo bhaag jaaen
 If Congress leaders like Sibal feel it is treason
 endie main bijepi ke saathi dal janata dal you (jediu) ke netaa ne bijepi saansad sakshi maharaj ke khilaaf aapattijanak tippanee kii he
 Gulam Rasul Baliyavi, the chairman of the party's minority committee, questioned Sakshi Maharaj's DNA and said that if his DNA is tested, the DNA of any minister of the Mughal king will be found
 jediu ke emelsi gulam rasul baliyavi ne gaya ke circuit house main unke khilaaf yah baat kahi
 He also targeted Sakshi Maharaj's statement on Jama Masjid
 baliyavi ne kaha ki log desh ko kahaan le ja rahe hai jab maamla (ram mandir kaa) supreme court main he to tathyon ke saath saamana kijiye
 This uneasiness is telling that these people have nothing to do with the temple, but politics is being traded on the issue of temple
 unhone kaha ki kya kisi bhi muslim samudaay ke logon ne mandir banane kaa virodh kiya he? ab to maamla mandir kaa he yaa mandir kii jameen ke vivaad kaa he
 If you dig someone, go to Supreme Court with the facts of what will come out
 baliyavi ne kaha ki gorakhnath mandir kii puri jameen asif dhaula kii he, sakshi maharaj main dam he to isaki jaanch karvaa len
 These people are making fun of the country's constitution and the court, which is weakening the country
 jediu netaa ne uddhav thakare ke ayodhya kaarykram par kaha ki ye log jitne bhi road par hangaamaa kar rahe he kisi main ram kii bhakthi nahin he, ye sab satta bhakthi, swarthbhakti or parivaar bhakthi he
 Because Shiv Sena land in Maharashtra is over, so have come to burglar
 unhone kaha ki abhi desh main khud ko sabase bada dharmik sabit karne kaa compatishan chal rahaa he lekin modi ji or yogi ji ye samajhen ki desh aasthaa or dharm se nahin samvidhan se chalata he
 Let me tell you that recently Sakshi Maharaj had said that leave kashi-mathura-ayodhya, break the Jama Masjid of Delhi, if the statues do not come out of the stairs, then hang me

 The SIT has suggested that tax evasion of Rs 50 lakh or more should be made a specified offense, so that action can be taken under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)

 So this time BJP has fielded Arun Jaitley instead of Sidhu
 akaliyon se naaraaz siddhu apane chunaav kshetra main prachaar bhi nahin kar rahe hai, jabaki jetali se unke behad achche vyaktigat sambandh hai haalanki amritsar se hi bijepi kii vidhayak unki patni navjot cor zarur jetali ke liye vot maang rahi hai
 By the way, several seats were suggested to Jaitley to contest the election which includes seats like Jammu, New Delhi and Jaipur
 magar akali dal ke mukhiya sardaar prakaash singh badal ke vyaktigat anurodh ke chalate jetali ne amritsar se chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 He has his roots in Punjab and that is why he dismisses the Congress accusations that he is an external candidate
 jetali ke liye amritsar seat par jeet tay maani ja rahi thi lekin tabhi congress ne captain amarinder singh ko yahaan se chunaav maidan main utaar diya
 Captain himself was unwilling to contest from Amritsar
 vah zyaada vakt apane kshetra patiala main dena chaahate the
 Where his wife is contesting the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin congress kii ranneeti jetali ko amritsar main hi gherne ke rahi isliye khud sonia gandhi ke kehane par captain vahaan se chunaav ladane ko taiyaar hue hai
 The battle of Amritsar turned out to be a thorn in Captain Amarinder Singh's fight as he is targeting Jaitley as well as his traditional rival Akali Dal
 isiilie amritsar kaa chunaav jetali ke saath hi akali dal kii pratishtha se bhi jud gaya he
 Six of the nine assembly seats in this Lok Sabha seat are with the bjp-akali alliance
 gramin ilaakon par akali dal kii jabardast pakad he
 Three of the four assembly seats are with the Akali Dal
 jabaki shahar kii chah main se do bijepi or ek akali dal ke paas he
 Jaitley is likely to gain an edge in rural areas with the support of the Akali Dal
 jabaki shahari ilaakon main is badhat ko banaae rakhana unke liye bahut badi chunauti he
 Resentment towards the Akali Dal is visible in the cities as people are angry over lack of basic facilities and increase in tax
 jabaki jetali kii hi tarah captain amarinder singh bhi bahari hone ke aaropon ko jhel rahe hai
 Although they are getting the benefit of anger against Akali Dal in cities, they are also outraged by the UPA government over inflation and corruption
 captain par ye bhi aarope lagata he ki raja-maharaja vaali unki prishthbhumi unhen aam logon se ghulne-milane se dur rakhti he
 The Captain has not spent much time in Amritsar since he was declared a candidate, while Jaitley has also bought a house in Amritsar to eradicate the outsider's candidate and he is sitting here with his head open
 bijepi narendra modi ke karishme kaa phayda bhi amritsar ke shahari ilaakon main uthaanaa chaah rahi he
 So far Modi has conducted only one election rally in Punjab
 24 april ko wo amritsar main jetali ke samarthan main raily karenge
 BJP is confident that after that voters in urban areas will gather in support of Jaitley
 sambhavit endie sarkaar main jetali ko badi jimmedaari milane kii baat kah kar bhi akali dal or bijepi ke netaa unke paksh main vot maang rahe hai
 Jaitley's stature in the BJP is going in his favor
 jabaki gujarat main sikh kisaanon ke visthaapan kaa mudda uthaa kar captain amarinder is lok sabha seat ke pansth fisadi sikh matadaataaon ko apane paale main laane main jute hai
 In this way, the trend of opposition of two governments is visible in Amritsar seat
 centre kii congress ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar or rajya kii akali dal-bijepi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke khilaaf
 This trend is increasing the challenges of both Jaitley and Captain because it is causing difficulty in finding the mood of the voters
 aam aadmi party ne jane-maane sthaneey netra chikitsak doctor dalajit singh ko maidan main khadaa kar diya he jo congress or bijepi donon ke voton main send laga rahe hai
 That is why this battle of two veterans in Amritsar has become very interesting
 pichley kai dinon se kejariwal sarkaar dwaara dilli main kholi gai sharaab kii dukaanon or dilli sarkaar kii sharaab niti kaa virodh kar rahe swaraj abhiyaan ne dilli ke ilaakon main sharaab theke ke virodh main jansunwaayee kii
 Swaraj Abhiyan, which has been opposing the liquor policy of Delhi government through RTI for the last few days, has now hit the road with public support
 swaraj abhiyaan ne vajirpur kotla mubarak ke rihaayshi ilaake main khuleshrab ke thekeke khilaaf jansunwaayee kii
 The residents of Kotla Mubarakpur demanded leaders of the Sathswaraj Abhiyan to discontinue this liquor contract
 jansunwaayee ke dauraan swaraj abhiyaan ne dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar se nimnlikhit maang kiye-1
 On such a serious issue, even after such shocking revelations, the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi has neither any rebuttal nor any explanation
 sarkaar apni chuppi tode
 2
 sabhi shreneeyon ke thekon se hui sharaab kii kul khapat kii sahi jaankaree di jaae, or nashe par kaabo naa paane ke kaaran bataaye jaaen
 3
 rihaayshi ilaakon main sthaneey logon kii marji ke khilaaf khule sharaab ke thekon ko tay samay-seemaa main hataaya jaae
 Swaraj Abhiyan will give this campaign the form of movement
 4
 The Delhi government should make a provision in the Swaraj Bill that it is mandatory to obtain the permission of local residents (50% women) to open liquor contracts
 saath hi puraane sharaab ke thekon ke band karwaane kaa nirnay bhi sthaneey nivaasiyon, visheshkar mahilaon ke haath main ho

 76 (lakh) spent
 is kharche kaa bhi sarkaar ke paas byoraa uplabdh nahin he
 Swaraj Abhiyan demands that this amount be increased and detailed details of it should be made available
 sarkaar dilli ko nasha mukt banane ke apane chunavi vaadon ke prati patibaddhta darshaae
 6
 dilli sarkaar apni agali aabkaari niti tay karne se pehle, niti kaa doft charchaa or sujhaavon ke liye saarvajanik kare
 Anupam of Swaraj Abhiyan said that today we have to take a pledge that till this contract of Waziranagar is lifted, this campaign will be carried out and carried on
 prashanth bhushan ne jansunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki neshnal krime record ke mutabik desh main mahilaon ke khilaaf jitne bhi atyaachaar hoten hai, unamem sharaab sabase bada kaarak he
 In 2010, the government changed the law of not opening liquor contracts within a 100-meter radius in residential areas
 unhone kaha ki isko lekar aam aadmi party ke prarambhk dinon main swaraj bill ke tahat ek niti banaai gai thi
