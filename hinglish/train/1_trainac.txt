 However weak buffaloes can be killed

 phir bhi pune se kareeb ek ghante kii duuri par sasvad gaanv main gau-rakshakon kii bheed ne trek ko roak liya
 The crowd shook up with our cameraman Sanjay and the truck driver
 unka phone bhi chin liya
 They all abused him during this time
 ve log trek kii cabin main ghus aae or phir trek ko police stesan pahunchaa diya
 He never even bothered to see what was behind in the truck till he reached the police station

 These potters decorate the Diwali market by making a beautiful piece of clay with the help of chalk, hoping that they will also light up their Diwali with the sale of these diyas, but alas these markets are so silent even near Diwali and the shopkeepers are slowing down
 kumhaar bazaar ke pradhan sadsy or dukandaar anil kii maane to har saal cell girti hi ja rahi he
 People leave clay items as expensive, but hard work is very much in clay work and due to hand work, time is also very much
 isiilie inkaa daam thodaa zyada hota hai
 There is no lack of variety in this market of clay lamps
 ek se badhkar ek sundar sajile die or duusari saaj sajja kaa saamaan bhi yahan maujuud he
 But in spite of this, these clay lamps are available only to a few buyers, while the potters have also made wax lamps on the lines of Chinese goods here
 lekin iske baavjood ye dukandaar yahan din-din bhar baith kar bhi apana kharchaa nahin nikaal pate
 According to another shopkeeper Geeta, there used to be a lot of sales earlier, but in some 5 to 6 years, the sale has fallen by 30 to 40 percent and is continuously falling
 ye mitti ke diye or doosraa saamaan chini item kii tulana main mahanga hota hai
 Because the potter makes these goods with his own hand
 uske baad in items par ek ek decoration kaa kaam bhi karigar din raat kii mehnat se khud apane haath se karata he
 In such a situation, the buyer understands this hard work
 vahi graahak yahan in deeyon kii khariddaari ke liye aise desi bazaar main pahunchataa he
 Like this, in Indian culture, Diwali should be celebrated only by lighting a lamp of ghee in an earthen lamp, but for years, Chinese fighters have replaced Diwali lamps in Indian homes
 sasti chamchamati chini ladiyon kii vajah se hi desi bazaar saal dar saal manda hota ja rahaa he

 bollywood industry main in dinon jatvaad par ban rahi filmon kaa chalan joro par he
 From the title of Family of Thakurganj, many people would have guessed that this film is something like this
 magar aisa nahin he, ye film sach-jhooth or sahi-galat ke taane-bane par buni gai he
 The truth always wins, this lesson has been tried to give from this film
 jaahir si baat he ki film kaa mizaaj mazaakia he or acchhee panch lines kii bharmaar se ye film kabhi bhi thakee hui nahin lagati he
 One special thing with this film is that its star cast is quite good which has been completely successful in entertaining the audience
 kya he kahani-ye film do bhaaiyon, nunnu (jimmy shergal) or munnu (nandish sandhu) kii kahani he jisamen se ek sachai ke raste par chalata he to doosraa fareb, dabangai or luutmaar kaa rasta chunata he
 Elder brother Nunnu is very naughty since childhood and does not mind his studies
 magar chota bhai munnu sahi raste par chalane vaala ladkaa he
 There is a dialogue at the beginning of the film in which Nunnu's mother tells him that "the son's childhood goes away with the father's shadow gone from the son's head
" ''yaheen se kahani kii shuruyaat hoti he
 After the father's death all responsibility suddenly falls on Nunnu's shoulders
 chunki usne kabhi padhai nahin kii isliye wo apana or gharavaalon kaa pet paalane ke liye galat rasta pakad letaa he
 Meanwhile, the story also shows the emotion of an helpless mother
 wo apane bete kii harkaton se waakif hone ke baavjood khamosh rahanaa pasand karti he, kyonki uske paas koi doosraa rasta bhi nahin hota
 Nunnu is earning money from wrongdoings and his mother encourages him instead of scolding him
 nunnu buraai ke raste par chalate-chalate kaaphi aage bad jaataa he
 But it also helps people
 aam janon ke prati uske dil main aadar or dayaa kaa bhav hota he
 Along with wrongdoing, one also keeps on doing social service and becomes a favorite of the people
 vahiin doosraa bhai munnu pard-likh kar ek professor ban jaataa he or ek koching santhaan chalaata he
 Munnu has a feeling of respect for his elder brother, but he does not like his work and mannerisms
 wo bhai se ye saare kaam chhodane ko kahata he
 The path of goodness and truth inside Munnu succeeds in melting Nunnu, but also brings a huge twist in the story
 interval ke baad kii kahani isi twist par aadhaarit he
 Along with this, the rest of the characters are also active and in the end the film ends with a happy ending for a tease of pain
 kisi he acting-marpet or raubadaar kirdaar nibhaane main jimmy shergill ne maharath hasil kar lee he
 Jimmy Shergill has done gangster and action-filled roles in so many films that he looked perfectly fit in this role as well
 maahi gil kaa role bhi thik tha
 The chemistry of Nandish Sandhu and Pranati Rai Prakash in the film was also very cute
 sah kalakaaron main baba bhandari ke role main saurabh shukla ne ek baar phir se prabhavit kiya, espi ke role main pawan malhotra shandaar the
 Apart from this, Manoj Pahwa, Supriya Pilgaonkar, Yashpal Sharma, Mukesh Tiwari and Raj Zutshi are also well placed
 chote shahar main shoot kii gai ye film samaaj main fail rahe atyaachaar or kaali karatuuton kii dastaan bayaan karti he
 There is nothing new in the film
 magar kahani main kuch aise twist hai jo baandh kar rakhte hai
 There are some good dialogues
 ye film manoranjan se bharpoor he
 Manoj's Jha and Prince Singh can be praised for this

 With the Lok Sabha elections approaching, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has launched a populist declaration in West Bengal
 pehle hi kisaanon ke liye guarantishuda aarthik madad kaa elaan kar chukin mamata banerjee ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki unki sarkaar rajya karmchaariyon ke sabhi bakaayaa mahangaai bhatte (DA) kaa is saal janvari tak bhugtan kar degi
 During the conduct of the administrative review meeting in Birbhum district, Mamta Banerjee said, 'we do not have money, but we will pay all pending dearness allowance by January
 'mukhyamantri kii ghoshnaa ke mutabik rajya ke kareeb 8 lakh karmchaariyon ko basic vetan ke 125% ke aadhaar par mahangaai bhatta isi maheene se milane lagegaa
 This is 18% more than the current rate
 bataa den ki ye ghoshnaa aise vakt par kii gai, jab loksabhaa chunaav ko 5 maheene kaa vakt hi bachaa he
 In August last year, the Calcutta High Court overturned the order of the State Appellate Tribunal (SAT), stating that dearness allowance is a statutory right of all state employees
 SAT ne isse pehle vyavastha di thi ki mahangaai bhatte kaa faisla lene kaa adhikaar sirf rajya sarkaar ke vivek par nirbhar he or karmchaaree is par apane haq kaa daawa nahin jataa sakate
 After the increase in the rate of dearness allowance, the difference of DA between the central and state government employees will be 23%
 mamata banerjeene bade antar ke liye pashchim bengal main purvavarti left morcha sarkaar ko zimmedaar tehraaya
 Mamata Banerjee asked why the previous government did nothing to reduce this huge gap in 34 years? In West Bengal, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) is under pressure to bring the salaries of the state employees to the level of the states where the central government The revised pay scales have been implemented after the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission were approved in 2017

 piem modi ne ram manohar lohia kii jayanti par congress samet kshetriy dalon par nishaanaa sadhate hue ek blog likhaa, unhone likhaa ki jo log aaj dow
 They are tricking Lohia's principles, they will also cheat the countrymen tomorrow
 jo log dow
 Lohia claims to walk the path shown, why he is trying to humiliate her
 piem modi ne likhaa ki dow
 Thoughts of Lohia inspire us even today
 unhone krishi ko aadhunik banane or anndaataaon ke shashaktikaran ko lekar kaaphi kuch likhaa, unke inhen vichaaron ke anuroop endie sarkaar pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi, krishi sinchai yojana, soyal health card or anya yojanaon ke madhyam se kisaanon ke hit main kaam kar rahi he
 Targeting the Congress through a blog written on Lohia, PM Modi wrote that Dr
 lohia samaaj main vyaapt jati vyavastha or mahilaon evam purushon ke bich kii asamanta ko dekhakar behad dukhi hote the
 Our mantra of 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' and our track record of the last five years show that we have given Dr
 lohia ke vijan ko saakaar karne main mahatvapurn safalataa praapt kii he
 Had he been today, he would certainly have been proud to see the actions of the NDA government
 jab kabhi bhi dow
 Lohia used to speak either inside or outside Parliament, and his fear was clearly visible in the Congress
 vahiin, vipaksh kii anya partiyon ko lekar piem modi ne likhaa he ki aaj congress ke saath tathakthith lohiavaadi partiyaan avasarwaadi mahamilavati gathbandhan banane ko baichaiyn hai
 This irony is both ridiculous and condemnable
 pradhanmantri ne likhaa ki dow
 Lohia always considered dynastic politics as fatal to democracy
 aaj ve yah dekhakar jarur hairaan-pareshaan hote ki unke 'anuyaayi' ke liye apane pariwaron ke hit deshhit se upar hai
 He wrote that Dr
 lohia jivan ke har kshetra main purushon or mahilaon ke bich barabari ke pakshdhar rahe
 However, the conduct of parties steeped in the politics of vote bank was different from this
 yahi vajah he ki tathakthith lohiavaadi partiyon ne teen talaak kii amanviya pratha ko khatm karne ke endie sarkaar ke prayaas kaa virodh kiya

 According to a report by Geo News, Ali says that if Meesha does not ask for a false allegation, she will have to pay Rs 10 crore (rs
 6 crores of Indian currency) for defamation
 report main aage bataaya he ki agar misha ne jafar ke naam par kiye twit nahin hataae or unhone 2 saptaah main maafee nahin maangi to unke khilaaf manahani kaa maamla darj kiya jayega
 On the other hand, when Misha's lawyer Ahmed Pansota was asked about this, he said that his client had not received any legal notice of Zafar
 jabaran 'kis' karne kii koshish kii, ali jafar par kai mahilaon ne lagaae aropamish ne ye aarope ek twit ke jariye lagaae the
 He wrote- As a woman, public figure and mother, i have always tried to raise my voice, encouraging people who follow me, mainly girls who want to make their own way in Pakistan
 Huh
 mere kariyar ke dauraan mere parivaar or phens ne mujhe bahut pyaar or saport diya he
 This gave me the courage to raise my voice
 haalanki abhi bhi aise kai masale hai, jinke bare main baat karnaa mahila ke taur par thodaa mushkil he- khaskar yon shoshan
 Ali Zafar has described the allegations of Meesha Shafi as false

 He has revealed the entire story during the jamming session where Meesha had claimed sexual harassment

 baxur jile ke nandagaanv main 12 janvari se pehle sabakuch saamaanya tha
 But at present, the police is camping in this village for 24 hours
 do dinon ke bheetar ilaake se 28 giraftaaryaan ho chuki hai jisamen 10 mahilaayein shaamil hai
 Most of the people of the village have their phones switched off and many people have fled their houses to avoid arrest

 aar main 165 log namjad or 1450 agyaat abhiyukt banaae gaye hai
 For the last two days, there is a mixed atmosphere of fear and 'na jane kya ho jaye' in the entire area, especially in Mahadalit Tola, 60-70 houses of Nandgaon
 yahaan aapako yah bataate chalem ki 12 janvari ko rajya ke mukhiya nitish kumaar apni vikaas samiksha yatra ke dauraan nandagaanv pahunche the or yahaan unke kafile par jardast patharbaji hui
 The Chief Minister escaped safely but more than a dozen government vehicles were damaged and many police officers were injured
 is ghatana kaa jo video baahar aayaa usamen saaf-saaf dikhataa he ki mahilaayein, purush or jawan ladke saamne se guzar rahi sarkari gadiyon par eent chalaa rahe hai
 The stone pelting incident on the Chief Minister's convoy has transformed the calm and befree atmosphere of Nandgaon into a police force
 yahaan sawaal yah he ki aakhir yah patharbaji hui kyon? mukhyamantri ke kafile par patharbaji karne vaale log isi gaanv ke the yaa baahar se aae the? patharbaji kii is ghatana ko anjaam dene vaale kisi baat se naaraaz the yaa kisi ke bahekaave main aakar unhone is ghatana ko anjaam diya? ye kuch sawaal hai jo is ghatana ke sandarbh main lagaataar puche ja rahe hai
 According to local journalist Vinit Mishra, the incident was caused by the resentment among the local Mahadalits and the district administration underestimating the resentment
 vinit bataate hai, 'mahadalit tole ke logon ko laga tha ki vikaas kaary main unki andekhi ho rahi he
 He wanted to meet the Chief Minister coming to his village, tell him his point
 unase apane tole main nahin hue vikaas kii shikaayat karen
 The residents of the hamlet had also met the district administration officials with this desire but they did not listen to them
 wo sadak kinare khadey rahe or mukhyamantri kaa kafila unke saamne se dandanaate hue nikalne laga
 For some reason, some women got bullied and then started hurling stones
 ’haalanki nandagaanv ke mukhiya rajiv pathak ke mutabik mahaliton ke tole main bhi paryaapt vikaas hua
 When we asked Rajiv the reason for the stone pelting, he said, 'we too are thinking the same
 video main jo mahilaayein pathar chalaati dikh rahi hai wo ek din pehle tak hamaare saath hi naregaa main kaam kar rahi thim
 We did not even know that the people of that colony are angry and such a big incident will happen
 ’baatcheet ke dauraan rajiv se kai baar yah poocha jaataa hai ki agar sab saamaanya tha
 There was no discontent in any colony or any group, so how and why did this incident happen? But they do not have the answer to this question
 jawaab main wo baar-baar ek hi baat, alag-alag tareekon se kehete hue sunai dete hai -vikaas to har taraf hua he
 No habitation, no locality has been left
 vahiin dumraanv main rahane vaale saamaajik kaaryakarta or ilaake kii behatar samaj rakhane vaale rajiv singh kaa maananaa he ki yah ghatana sthaneey prashasan kii lapaharvaahee or vikaas kaary main daliton kii andekhi kaa parinaam tha
 Rajiv Singh goes into detail about that incident
 wo kehete hai, ’dekhie
 
 
 Development has taken place in two wards of that village as per the Chief Minister's plan in 06-07
 usee kaary ko dekhne mukhyamantri vahaan pahunche the
 There is a Dalit colony next to this ward
 kuch samay pehle dalit basti ke vikaas ke liye paisa aayaa tha lekin us paise ko duusare ward main kharch diya he
 This time too, the Ganga book of development in his changed hamlet, but the condition of his hamlet remained the same
 is baat ko basti ke log mukhyamantri se kahana chahte the
 He wanted to bring the Chief Minister in his hamlet
 ’rajiv aage bataate hai, 'mukhyamantri se milane ke liye sadak kinare khadey log, mukhyamantri kii gaadi nikalne ke baad thodi narebaaji jaisaa karne lage
 In response, the police and some local people pushed women with it, which led to this stone pelting
 ’ajtak ne dalit samudaay main bhi baat karne kii koshish kii lekin jyadataar phone band hone kii vajah se yah koshish asafal rahi
 Meanwhile, a video footage has come in which some local women and men are complaining that police are entering their houses at night
 aadmi-auraton ko giraftaar kiya ja rahaa he or is dauraan police unke saath maar peet bhi kar rahi he

 Earlier also, a video of Xiaomi came in which the chief of the company was seen using the foldable smartphone
 haal hi main samsung or huaave ne apane foldable smartfones launch kar die hai, lekin inamen se koi bhi market main nahin he
 This is the company's second video teaser showing a double folded smartphone
 ye video 10 seconds kaa he or ise chini micro bloging website vebo par share kiya gaya he he
 It has also been uploaded to youtube
 is video main dabl fold smartphone dekha ja saktaa he or swip jescher bhi he
 Like the Galaxy Fold and the Huawie Mate X, it is not one-fold, rather it is two-fold
 report ke mutabik shaomi kaa foldable smartphone is saal april se june ke bich launch ho saktaa he
 It will be special that its price will be different from the foldable smartphones of Samsung and Huawei
 philhal company ne is smartphone ke launch ke bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha he
 Significantly, foldable smartphones dominated this Mobile World Congress
 lekin shaomi ne is dauraan bhi foldable shokes nahin kiya
 But by the end of this year, three to four companies will have foldable smartphones in the market
 video dekhakar ye andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ye smartphone samsung or huaave ke foldable se thodaa bada he or alag bhi he
 Because foldable smartphones of Samsung and Huawei turn once, but this foldable smartphone can be folded

 Doritos is now going to be 'lady friendly'
 ji haa, aapane sahi suna
 The Tartilla Chip Maker is soon to launch the lady friendly version of Snacks
 is ladi friendli varjan main doritos kam kranchi or kam aawaaj karne vaala hoga
 Not only this, now the packet of snacks will also be seen in a different way, which can easily fit in the girls' bags
 company ke mutabik, market research main pataa chalaa he ki mahilaayein bahut tej aawaaj ke saath chips khaanaa pasand nahin karti hai
 This is how my life changed after getting married to my girlfriend
 Indira Nooyi, CEO Zindagi, told the New York Post, "you must have seen many boys eating chips, and when the chips are over, they start licking their fingers too
" packet main bache hue chips ko bhi packet se jhaadkar kha lete hai kyonki vah ise behad pasand karte hai or vah kisi bhi surat main packet main bache toote chips kaa nuksaan nahin sahanaa chaahate hai
 Women also want to do the same but they do not
 ve saarvajanik sthanon par zyada aawaaj karke nahin khaati hai or ve apni anguliyaan bhi nahin chaatati hai
 This decision of the company is being criticized
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki is tarah ke kadamon se gender steriotip or majboot hoga
 The thinking between boys and girls will be further encouraged
 jaise ladakiyon ko aawaaj karke nahin khaanaa chahie, unhen khulkar nahin hansanaa chahie ityadi
 Apart from this, people have also emphasized that many customers will distance themselves from the move to bring small packet for women at the same price

 apane is twit ke saath unhone ek akhbaar kii puraani khabar bhi twit kii thi, jisamen unke hawaale se 370 hataane kii vakaalat kii gai thi

 Parties should put aside ideological fixations & debate what's best for India's sovereignty & federalism, peace in J&K, jobs for Kashmiri youth & justice for Kashmiri Pandits
 Apart from him Janardan Dwivedi said that Ram Manohar Lohia was also its support

 Not only because the special session of the Legislative Assembly has been called for the first time in the legislative history for the reinstatement of the two sitting mlas of the Congress but also because the Congress itself opposed the reinstatement of its mlas
 maje kii baat he ki sattadhari party bijepi khuleam unke samarthan main thi
 Recently, during the assembly session, Congress mlas created a lot of uproar over their one demand
 unhone spikar ishvardaas rohani ko kamare se baahar nahin nikalne diya tha or unki aasandi par chadh mej par rakhe kaagaj phenk die the
 These mlas were demanding a discussion on the income tax raids on the houses of businessmen Dilip Suryavanshi and Sudhir Sharma
 in kaarobaariyon ke varisht bijepi netaaon se rishte bataae jate hai
 The next day, on 18 July, Chaudhary Rakesh Singh Chaturvedi, a MLA from Bhind and Kalpana Parulekar, a legislator from Mahidpur, were dismissed for misbehaving with the Speaker and creating ruckus in the House

 Parulekar and Chaturvedi withdrew from the party line and together with the representatives of the state government, pardoned the speaker
 iske baad puraa paridrishy hi badal gaya
 When the BJP called a special assembly session for the restoration of the mlas, the Congress termed their reinstatement as unconstitutional
 congress ne apano se munh kii khai he
 The move by its legislators has left an issue of encircling the BJP in the hands of the party
 pradesh congress anushaasan samiti ke adhyaksh hajarilal raghuvanshi kehete hai, ''yah ek bada mudda tha jo haath se chalaa gaya
 But how can the Speaker of the Assembly make unqualified legislators back
 '' pradesh congress adhyaksh kantilal bhuriya asamanjas main hai, ve na to vidhayakon kaa virodh kar paa rahe hai or na hi samarthan
 However, in order to save the honor of the party, he made the allegation that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and the speaker had written an apology letter threatening and threatening the mlas
 vipaksh ke netaa ajay singh bhi maanate hai ki maafeename ke bare main unhen koi jaankaree nahin thi
 Congress MP Sajjan Singh Verma asks, "can the Speaker or the Legislative Assembly restore them?" But Speaker Ishwar Das Rohani not only dismissed the dismissal of the mlas, but also justified the reinstatement, saying "the dismissed mlas reconsidered the decision He had requested and regretted his actions

 Whoever faces defeat, should form an alliance: Unlike Chanakya Amit Shah, Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav are not considered admirers of ancient political guru Chanakya or his political philosophy
 so, may 2014 kii garmiyon main ek subah jab lalu ne apni beti misa ke manaane par siyaasi pratidwandvi apane puraane dost nitish ko phone par apane man kii baat kah daali ki kaise unke alag-alag rahane kaa laabh modi lahar ko mila or donon kaa siyaasi bhavishya usamen dub gaya, to is baat ko samajhane ke liye unhen chanakya kii sookhti kii jarurat nahin padi
 They did not have the crisis of defeat, but they had tasted a hard taste of defeat
 unhen aisa lag rahaa tha ki aisi or kadavi khuraaken abhi baaki hai
 Forming alliances was a matter of time, but the task was not as easy as it seemed
 bihar jaise bheeshan siyaasi pratidwandvita vaale rajya main nijee or rajnatik matbhedon ko paatna bahut bada kaam jaan padataa tha
 The credit goes to these two leaders that instead of drowning separately, they decided to hold each other's hands and swim together
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi ki ravivaar 8 november ko nitish un karodon logon main shaamil nahin the jo tadake uthakar bihar ke loktantric drame ko dekhne ke liye tivi kholkar baith gaye the
 Instead, Nitish thought it appropriate to stay asleep for some more time, despite that he is used to getting up early
 ve dil se jaanate the ki pichley 18 maheenon main unhone lalu ke saath milakar jo kathin marathon daud lagaai he, uski mehnat bekaar nahin jane vaali he
 They were busy taking feedback from the ground level for the last three consecutive days and there was nothing negative from anywhere
 ve sokar uthne ke baad kareeb nau baje kuch doston ke saath bhunaa hua chuda or herbal chaay lekar tivi ke saamne baith gaye
 After this, a flood of phone calls came to him
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa phone saadhe das baje ke kareeb aayaa
 Modi congratulated Nitish for the success and said that this mandate reflects people's trust in his work
 unki jeet jitani mithi thi, uske mukaable unka pratishodh kahin zyada meetha sabit hua
 This was the same room in which Nitish had seen all the speeches of Modi on TV during the last few months and devised a strategy to find his cut
 in maheenon ke dauraan modi samooche bihar main gum-ghumkar 30 reliyon ko sambodhit kar chuke the jo ek pradhanmantri ke liye apratyaashit tha
 Nitish addressed 230 and Lalu addressed 251 meetings
 faisle ke din haalanki is sankhya kii koi ahmiyat nahin thi
 The real meaning was the combined figures of Nitish's Janata Dal (U) and Lalu's Rashtriya Janata Dal, whose thorn came to a halt at 178 in the 243-seat assembly
 saadhe baarah baje ke kareeb nitish kaa phone baja to duusari ore lalu the
 The two congratulated each other on this spectacular performance
 inhone milakar jo hasil kiya tha, vah kuch maheene pehle takreeban naammumkin jaan padataa tha
 Their grand alliance had dented the BJP
 vaapasi kii patakathagyarah maheene pehle nitish jab sard disambar kii ek subah dilli aae the, us vakt agar kisi ne jeet kii sambhaavna kii bhavishyavaanee kar di hoti, to ve khud ise ek bhadda majaak samaj kar khaarij kar dete
 It is true that after the alliance of RJD and his party with the Congress, a ray of hope was seen in the August 2014 by-elections
 in partiyon ko mili vot bhi paryaapt the
 16 in Lok Sabha elections to JD (U) with the support of ultra backward, Mahadalit and Muslims
 04 fisadi vot mili the
 20 to RJD by mixing Yadav and Muslim
 46 fisadi vot mili the jabaki congress ne 8
 Garnered 56 votes
 inhen mila diya jaae to kul 45
 06 per cent of the votes are formed, 36 of the bjp-led NDA
 48 fisadi voton se zyada hai
 Despite this, Nitish knew well that elections were not just a game of mathematics
 iske alaava, loksabhaa chunaav main kharaab pradarshan ke baad bhaavnaatmak kadam uthaate hue unhone istipha dekar mahadalit jithan ram maanjhi ko mukhyamantri bana diya, yah kadam bhi palatwaar karne laga tha
 Manjhi was going on giving rise to controversy after another
 nitish ke sushasan kaa record chhijata ja rahaa tha, kyonki bhrashtachar ne uski jagah le lee thi or logon kaa mohabhang hota ja rahaa tha
 The problem was that the election was barely ten months away
 loksabhaa main haar ke baad nitish puure rajya main gum-ghumkar party ke kaaryakartaaon se mili the or ve jaanate the ki unki party kaa bhavishya khatm hone nahin ja rahaa tha
 Despite this, a lot was yet to be done
 duusari ore haryana, maharashtra or jharkhand main lagaataar mili jeet ne bijepi ke ubhaar ko aparaajey sthiti main laa diya tha
 That is why one morning in December, when Nitish came to meet Prashant Kishore, a 37-year-old young man in Delhi, his hopes were dim like the sun of the capital
 kishor sanyukt raashtra main ek swasthyakarmi the jinhen loksabhaa chunaavon main modi kii shandaar jeet kaa kuch shrey diya ja saktaa he
 Kishore was a favorite of Modi who coined a new campaign format to take him to 7, Race Course which was on the lines of the US Presidential election
 aktubar 2014 main kishor ke amit shah se sambandh bighad gaye the or ve jedy(you) ke rajyasabha saansad pawan ke
 Was in contact with Verma
 unhone nitish ke saath kaam karne kii ichha jaahir kii thi
 Verma had told Nitish very effectively about this young man after which Nitish agreed to meet him
 kishor ne nitish ko salaah di ki ve dobaaraa mukhyamantri pad par laut jaaen
 The sooner this work, the better
 mana jaataa he ki nitish ne bhale hi is par turant koi pratikriya na di ho, lekin ve unki baat se sahamat the
 Kishore had done a little study before about Nitish's rule
 ve is baat se kaaphi prabhavit the ki sirf teen fisadi vot vaale chote-se kurmi samudaay se aane vaala ek mukhyamantri aakhir kaise jatvaad se grast bihar ke sabhi tabakon ke bich baraabar kaa bharosa banaae hue he
 Nitish had credibility, a good record of good governance and his image of a well-performing leader
 unki santulit shakchisyat or rajnatik rup se sadha hua aacharan unhen atirikt laabh detaa tha
 The BJP had captured the entire Bihar in the Lok Sabha elections, but around 65 per cent of the people had not voted for it even then and this was the biggest opportunity for Nitish in Kishore's view
 nitish ke dobaaraa mukhyamantri banane ke faisle ne bihar ke siyaasi khel ko to badal diya, lekin maanjhi ko hataanaa itnaa aasaan nahin tha kyonki ve ad gaye or jedy (you) ke bheetar baghawat ho gai
 The BJP took advantage of this crisis by eyeing Mahadalit votes
 nitish ko mukhyamantri pad par waapas aate-aate farvari aa gai
 He now had just seven months to prepare to take on the strength of BJP and Modi
 kishor itane samay ko paryaapt maanakar chal rahe the
 Nitish had to be the chief ministerial candidate, so Manjhi's work had to be repaired and he had to show that things were under his control
 bijepi ne sabase badi galati maanjhi ko saath lekar kar di kyonki yaheen se uski patakatha badal gai&ab bijepi sushasan kii jagah pichhadaa kii rajnatik naav par savaar ho chuki thi
 People of Bihar knew that the category of Mahadalit was actually made by Nitish, which he has also awarded all the government benefits
 isiilie 8 november ko aae parinaam dikhaate hai ki daliton or mahadaliton ne vaaki nitish ko vot diya he
 The benefit of the first move came in the color of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 ve jaanate the ki sadakon or shiksha kii hi tarah bijli bhi saamaanya jivan ko prabhavit karti he, so unhone sabase pehle is kshetra ko pakadaa
 Action was taken very quickly and transmission capacity increased to more than 1,000 MW while more than 20,000 burnt transformers were replaced in the state
 barason se vanchit rahe bihar jaise rajya main is pahal ne bada fark laa diya
 Things picked up in June with the arrival of Kishore with Nitish and the initial advantage of taking initiative in terms of electoral strategy was given to Nitish
 bijepi ne apana chunaav prachaar abhiyaan shuru karne main is ashanka ke kaaran deree kar di ki kahin bich me hi uski lay na tut jaae
 At the same time, Kishore and his team started a campaign called Badh chalhari-bihar @ 2025 in June itself
 yah kaarykram bhale sarkari tha, lekin isamen 10,000 se zyada svaichhik kaaryakartaaon ko lagaaya gaya tha jo bihar ke 40,000 se zyada gaanvon main ja-jaakar nitish sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko rekhaankit kar rahe the or logon se raay le rahe the ki ve agle das saal main kya chaahate hai
 By the time Amit Shah unveiled the BJP election campaign vehicle on July 16, Nitish had already received feedback from across the state, which enabled him to better build his campaign
 kishor ne ek or shuruaati kaam yah kiya ki unhone patna or bihar ke bade shaharon ke sabhi ahm margon par lage tamaam billboard or hording kharid daale
 Within a few days, red and golden billboards with pictures of Nitish and Lalu started appearing
 pratyaashiyon ke naam ghoshit hone ke baad unki tasveeron vaale nae billboard bhi laga die gaye
 As a result, people started taking interest in elections ahead of time
 kishor ko sirf pehali chaal kaa phayda nahin mila
 a JD (U) leader close to Nitish says that his hoardings "caused a psychological change in Nitish's candidates as well
 bina kader vaali ek pastahimmat party ke kaaryakarta achaanak khud ko gambhirtha se lene lage or log bhi gambhir ho gaye
 “many such steps kept increasing, and finally, on August 30, the entire rally of the grand alliance at the Gandhi Maidan in Patna came up in Bihar
 ateet se muktinitish ke liye maanjhi agar khiz paidaa karne vaale ek tatv rahe jinhone unka kuch shram or vakt jaaya kar daalaa, to lalu unke liye sirdard sabit ho sakate the
 Nitish is orderly and well-to-do, while Lalu is the opposite
 in donon kii style, praathamiktaayen, sarokaar or raajnneeti bilkul alahada hai
 Nitish's entire image was built on good governance, while Lalu was a leader with his vote bank on his shoulder
 jaahir he, lalu se achaanak talmail baitha lenaa nitish kii samarthy main hi nahin tha
 On more than one occasion he could not share the stage with Lalu and he even said that he could not work under pressure
 donon ke bich khulkar bayaanbaji hui
 When Lalu accepted Nitish as the face of the coalition chief minister on 8 June, he said that he was ready to drink poison
 udhar nitish 13 july ko lalu kii iftaar party main jane kii bajaae dilli main sonia gandhi kii party main chale gaye
 Both leaders on 20 July when former Chief Minister S
K
 en
 While attending Sinha's birth-centenary celebrations, Lalu mentioned at least seven times in his 45-minute address that he was behind the Bihar Chief Minister
 nitish ne koi pratikriya nahin di or udasin bane rahe
 a day later, he tweeted and compared himself to the sandalwood tree, which is ineffective with poisonous snakes wrapped around it
 is samay tak ekadam yah lagane laga tha ki gathbandhan tut jayega
 Nitish then quietly went to Lalu's house one day and the two spent almost an hour together
 iske baad donon ko saarvajanik taur par ek-duusare ke khilaaf bayaan dete kabhi nahin paaya gaya
 When the two came together on the seat sharing, the alliance looked strong
 isamen nitish ke sushasan kii saakh bhi thi or lalu kaa thos vot bank bhi
 Nitish's biggest bet was to give 41 seats to Congress while he had only five mlas
 us vakt yah ranneetik galati jaan pad rahi thi, lekin anjaane main iskaa nateeja yah hua ki rajya ke 17 fisadi muslim matadaata mahagathbandhan ke saath majbootee se khadey ho gaye
 The prescriptions that are unmatched today were very simple: Lalu's social justice pan was to be weighed with Nitish's tried good governance
 donon kaa hi uddeshy garibon or vanchiton ko shashakt karnaa tha
 Women were to be given special importance as a section
 iske alaava “bihari banaam bahari” kaa jumala to sabake liye tha hi
 Shaibal Gupta of the Patna-based Asian Development Research Institute says that Nitish has done caste / class benefits in terms of road, power and infrastructure development in Bihar
 ve kehete hai, “duusari ore lalu rajya main pichhadon ke ubhaar ke pratik rahe hai
 The truth is that you cannot fight communalization without organizing the backward
 isliye nitish or lalu ko milakar nabbe ke dashak kii shuruyaat vaali mandal-kamandal kii raajnneeti ko dobaaraa jinda karnaa hi tha
 While the NDA constituents kept on fighting over seat-sharing, Nitish quietly negotiated the deal with Lalu and the Congress
 ek baar main isaki antim ghoshnaa kar di gai jisane yah abhas diya ki gathbandhan shashakt he
 This task was not easy
 pichhali vidhansabha main 115 siten hone ke baavjood nitish ne na keval 101 siton par ladgaye kaa faisla kiya balki lalu kii jholii main jedy (you) kii do darjan se zyada siten daal deen
 In return, he got just one seat from Lalu
 yah baat alag he ki jedy (you) ke kai pratyaashiyon ko congress main jagah mil gai
 Another strategic move by Nitish was to decide that he and Lalu would be campaigning fiercely for each other's candidates
 inhone congressi pratyaashiyon ke liye bhi prachaar sabhaayen kin or yah sandesh pahunchaaya ki gathbandhan majboot he
 Nitish's quiet gesture got the support of the people
 ve bijepi ke tikhe, teevr, maarak or vibhaajak waar se vichlit nahin hue
 Even when Nitish attacked, he questioned Modi's unfulfilled promises
 mahagathbandhan ne aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ke aarakshan kii samiksha sambandhi bayaan ko bhi le udaye main deree nahin kii
 Kishore sent more than 20 lakh messages to whatsapp on bjp's plan to abolish reservation
 iske alaava unhone yah aashwast kiya ki lalu or nitish kii har raily main badi sankhya main aise parche baante jaaen jin par aakraamak sandesh chape hon
 He also decided that after every rally of Modi and Amit Shah, either Lalu or Nitish will hold a rally in the neighborhood within 24 to 48 hours
 vichaar yah tha ki modi or shah ke bayanon kii kaat logon ke saamne rakhi ja sake
 Interesting names like "jumla Babu" were also coined for Modi
 bihar ke yuvaaon kaa adarshanithish jaan rahe the ki modi apni chunaav sabhaaon main baari bheed khinch rahe the or unke vaadon par tali bajaane vaale zyaadaatar yuva matadaata hi the
 bjp's promises to give him color TV or scooty proved futile in front of Nitish's own vision document
 nitish kii sabhaaon main aae yuva jor se tali bajaate the jab ve unhen nirushulk angreji bolne ke prashikshan kaa vaada karte the
 31 per cent of Bihar's population is below 30 years of age and Nitish understood its pulse
 bihar kii 245 siton main prayek main ausatan 85,000 matadaata 30 saal se neeche ke hai
 The Lok Sabha election was in disarray with JD (U), CPI, congress-rjd and NDA being in the fray
 is baar ke chunaav main puri tarah dhruvikaran ko anjaam diya gaya tha
 Despite this, Nitish got the most support from the youth
 in yuvaaon ke alaava bihar main 18 se 19 saal ke bich pehali baar matdaan karne vaale kareeb 25 lakh matadaata bhi the
 At least six years before the birth of these voters, there was a rejuvenation of the politics of the Hindi belt in the Mandal wave, so the RJD government of lalu-rabri was missing in their memory
 isiilie jangalraj ke aaropon se unhen koi fark nahin padaa
 Girls from this section studied in school when Nitish started Mukhyamantri Cycle Yojana
 unhone nitish ko jamkar vot diya
 Today, when Nitish is about to start a new term of his government in Bihar, he will have to remember his difficult and thorny path leading to this victory and also to the diverse groups who have supported him continuously
 satta ke is khel main utaar-chadhaav aaenge jinase nibatane ke liye unhen or lalu ko vah kaushal hameshaa yaad rakhana hoga jisaki madad se ve ek-duusare se or endie ke lagaae tamaam aaropon se nibat sake hai
 It is up to these veterans that they protect this mandate and strengthen it or damage it with their short-sightedness
 nitish ko is baat kaa ehsaas he, yah india today ko kahi unki is baat se jaahir hota he, “yah janata kaa janadesh he, ham jhukkar sweekaar karte hai
 i have to work hard to take Bihar to the next level of development
 ” philhal to ve or lalu is mahajit kaa jashn manaane kii mohalat le hi sakate hai

 repist baba gurmeet ram rahim kii timaardaar banakar uske saath jail main rahane kaa sapana dekhne vaali haniprit khud bhi ek din jail kii salaakhon ke peeche pahunch jaaegi, aisa usne kabhi nahin sochaa tha
 Now he is in need of a timber in prison, because he is surrounded by many diseases there
 darasal, gurmeet ram rahim ko police kii giraft se chhudwane main naakaam rahihaniprit insakhud uske saath jail main rahanaa chaahati thi
 To fulfill this desire, a fake medical certificate was prepared
 jisamen saaf likhaa tha ki haniprit gurmeet ram rahim kii atendent he
 He is aware of his illnesses
 isliye uskaa baba ke kareeb rahanaa nihaayat hi jaruri he, kyonki gurmeet ram rahim anfit he
 But the jail administration had already arranged a team of doctors
 jisane gurmeet ram rahim kii medical jaanch karke use feet qaraar de diya tha
 And then Gurmeet Ram Rahim and Honeypreet's dream of living together was shattered
 haniprit ko timardaar kii darkaarakabhi gurmeet ke mehalon main rani kii tarah rahane vaali haniprit insa aaj jail kii salaakhon ke peeche badtar haalat main hai
 After being in police lockup for 9 days, he now has to spend the next 23 days in Ambala Central Jail, as the next hearing of the case has been scheduled on 6 November
 makhmali gaddon par sone vaali haniprit ke liye jail main ab ek maili kuchaili dari he or cell number 11 kaa kathor farsh
 Honeypreet Insa, who was traveling with Baba Gurmeet in a luxury car worth more than Rs 1
5 crore, arrived in Ambala in a van of prisoners
 wo bhi vine kii seat par nahin balki seat ke farsh par baithkar
 So that people do not look at him
 thane main dhunipichley do maheenon se bhi zyada samay ke dauraan haniprit insa ab ksht baari jindagi ji rahi he
 If sources are to be believed, after being taken on remand at Sector 23 police station in Panchkula, the police officers also looted him one night so that he could unleash all the secrets
 timaardaar kii zaruratshareerik or maansik takalif jhel rahi haniprit kaa vajan bhi kam ho gaya he
 Along with this, he has been surrounded by many diseases including migraine
 uske chehre se raunak gaayab he
 She looks ill
 use aaraam chahie
 The situation is that now he needs a timber himself
 uski beemaari bad rahi he or khaanaa-pinaa kam ho gaya he
 Honeypreet Insa, who is living a life of difficulty in Ram Rahim's concern, still worries about Ram Rahim
 gurmeet ke prati uskaa lagaav or moh kam nahin hua he
 During the 9-day police remand, Honeypreet had expressed her desire to meet Gurmeet Ram Rahim several times
 usne doctoron ko kaha tha ki baba ko qamar dard rahata he
 She wants to meet him
 is bich karwachouth, dashahra or diwali jaise kai bade tyohaar guzar gaye
 When her parents arrived in jail to meet her, she started crying bitterly
 wo apane gharavaalon se dher sari baaten karnaa chaahati thi, lekin samay khatm ho gaya
 Medical certificates will be examined
 It is worth mentioning that Gurmeet Ram Rahim and Honeypreet had made a false medical report with the help of two doctors of Dera and two eminent doctors of Delhi
 jiske aadhaar par haniprit insa ek atendent ke taur par baba ke saath jail main rahanaa chaahati thi
 That medical report was handed over to the police
 uski ek copy aaj tak ke paas bhi maujuud he
 Now, apart from fake medical of Gurmeet, Vipassana Insa also wants to get medical certificate checked
 saaf he ki haniprit or gurmeet ke alaava un doctoron kii bhi takalif badhane vaali he, jinhone farji medical certificate uplabdh karwaae the

 He said, if he wishes, i can meet him with Yogendra ji, so that the problems can be solved to the extent possible

 aise sabhi aarope galat hai
 Significantly, BJP MP Anant Hegde, famous for his statements, has said that it surprised everyone by saying that Devendra Fadnavis was made CM for three days to transfer Rs 40,000 crore from Maharashtra
 unhone kaha, 'aapako pataa he ki hamaare aadmi 80 ghante ke liye maharashtra main siem bana tha
 After this Fadnavis resigned
 unhone yah drama kyon kiya tha? kya hamen pataa nahin tha ki hamaare paas bahumat nahin he phir bhi vah mukhyamantri bane
 This is the question everyone asks
 mukhyamantri ke paas kareeb 40 hajaar karod rupee the
 If congress-ncp and Shiv Sena had come to power, they would have misused these funds
 yah sab centre kaa paisa tha or iskaa istemaal rajya ke vikaas main nahin hota
 All this was decided long ago
 isliye yah drama rachaa gaya

 Amid the ongoing political upheaval in Bihar, 20 pro-nitish ministers have resigned from the cabinet of Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi
 isse pehle maanjhi ne apane 15 mantriyon ko hataane kii sifaarish kii thi
 They were all ministers who opposed him in the cabinet meeting today
 maanjhi ne ramai ram, ramlakhan ram raman, dulalchand goswami, manoj kuswaha jaise dalit netaaon or naushaad alam ko chhod diya tha, haalanki in paanchon ne bhi ab nitish ke samarthan main apane pad se istipha de diya he
 Earlier, the ruling JDU once chose Nitish Kumar as the new leader of the legislative party, bypassing Manjhi, who had taken a rebellious stand, paving the way for his return to the post of CM
 apane chayan ke baad nitish ne kaha ki vah sarkaar banane ke liye daawa pesh karenge or is varsh ke ant main hone vaale bihar vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ke khilaaf ladai ko taarkik parinti tak pahunchaayenge
 He said that JDU national president Sharad Yadav will contact Governor Kesarinath Tripathi today to present his claim to form the government and tomorrow the allies will submit their letters of support to the governor
 nitish ne kaha ki bahumat unke paas he or jarurat padane par apane sankhya bal kii rajyapal ke samaksh parade bhi kara denge

 Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh proposed to dissolve the Assembly in the meeting
 mantrimandal kii is ahm baithak main sabhi 29 mantriyon ne hissaa liya
 Rajiv Ranjan alias Lallan Singh and PK Shahi did not attend the meeting as Governor Kesarinath Tripathi accepted the Chief Minister's recommendation to sack both of them
 nitish ke kareebi samajhe jane vaale khaadya mantri shyaam rajak ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki jin logon ne maanjhi kaa paksh liya or vidhansabha ko bhang karne ke prastaav ko manjuuri di usamen narendra singh, vrishin patel, binay bihari, shahid ali khan, nitish mishra, bhim singh or mahachandra prasad singh shaamil hai
 Earlier, the tussle between former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and current Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi for the last several days reached a peak when there was a furore during the state cabinet meeting on Saturday and Manjhi supporters Narendra Singh and Nitish Supporters Shyam Rajak clashed with each other
 vaise, cabinet baithak se kuch hi der pehle maanjhi ne nitish ke ghar jaakar unase mulaakaat bhi kii thi
 Manjhi and Kumar lasted for nearly two hours, which was seen as a last-ditch effort to reach a compromise between two conflicting factions within the JD (U)
 is baithak main party adhyaksh sharad yadav ne bhi hissaa liya
 It is noteworthy that on Friday evening, Manjhi also sacked two ministers of the Nitish camp PK Shahi and Rajiv Ranjan alias Lallan Singh from the cabinet
 sutron ke mutabik, rajyapal ne inaki barkhaastagi kii sifarish ko manjuur kar liya he
 The sacked minister Rajiv Ranjan says that Chief Minister Manjhi is working on the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the BJP is also behind his (rajiv Ranjan and PK Shahi) dismissal

 unhone kaha, ‘sach kahuun to mere ek dost ne yah jaanane ke liye mujhe phone kiya ki main jinda hum, kyonki har koi aise baat kar rahaa jaise main jinda nahi hum
 Cook, who was close to Sachin's record, retired from international cricket, he said, "it feels good when you hear a lot of good things about yourself
" udhaaharan ke taur par, jab main gaadi chalaa rahaa tha or kisi ne mujhase khidki ke shishe ko neeche karvaa kar kaha ki ‘bahut-bahut dhanyavad’

 'it is difficult to say,' said Cook, but for the last six months i had given such indications

 In today's age and age it is very difficult to keep everything hidden

 The third way was that the government would have assured to bring this bill in the next session
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki 187 sanshodhano par charchaa karne main samay lagata he
 OK, the government would have taken its time but would have assured to bring it to the next session, but the government did not do so

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on the 2G verdict that the decision of the court should not be considered as a certificate, the zero loss theory has already been canceled
 unhone kaha ki 2ji aavanton ke dauraan gadabadi hui thi, supreme court ne bhi is prakriya ko galat mana tha
 The allocation was done in 2007 on the basis of 2001
 unhone kaha ki bank draft ko advance taarikh main hi taiyaar kiya gaya tha, cat of date advance main hi tay ho gaya tha

 Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav exhorted the party workers to improve their conduct and behavior and not ignore the public
 mulaayam ne sapa ke naunve rashtriya sammelan main kaha, janata apni upeksha kabhi nahin bhuulati
 SP workers should keep conduct, behavior right among the public and behave with restraint
 pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha, jo garajte hai, barasate nahin
 
 
 China repeatedly infiltrates India's border

 He cautioned about eight thousand SP workers present at the conference, somewhere responsible people ignore the public, so want to be careful not to forget the public
 janata hi sarvopari he
 Do not do any work that causes stains

 He said that many leaders had committed such mistakes and had to bear the brunt of this, so mps and mlas should act according to the expectations of the people

 In the January 4 episode of 'kumkum Bhagya', Poorab informs Pragya, Dadi and Dasi about their plan so that Abhi and Pragya can get closer to each other
 teenon ko purab kaa plan pasand aata he or ve usase maafee maangate hai ki unhone use galat samajha
 Meanwhile, Abhi is thinking about the pictures of Poorab, Nikita (pragya) and both of them, when Tanu comes there and tries to fill her ears by talking wrong about them both
 haalanki abhi usase kahata he ki vah un donon ke bare main baat nahin karnaa chahta
 After this, Tanu and Alia make fun of Pragya
 tanu kahati he ki ab abhi uskaa ho jayega is par pragna kahati he ki aisa kabhi nahin hoga
 At the same time, Alia and Tanu make fun of Pragya and Purab's relationship
 aalia kahati he ki jab purab ne kaha ki vah pragna se pyaar karata he to use bura laga kyonki kabhi vah purab se pyaar karti thi
 She then tells Pragya that Abhi hates her so she should leave the house and leave
 tippaniyan Pragya tells them that no matter how much they plan, no one can come between her and Abhi
 unhen alag karne main ve donon kabhi safal nahin hongi
 Meanwhile, Poorab goes to Abhi and says that she should listen to him once
 lekin abhi usase kahata he ki vah usase koi baat nahin karnaa chahta he
 He then blames himself as to why he trusted Pragya
 udhar pragna jab ghar waapas pahunchati he to sarala usase purab or uski tasveeron ke bare main puuchhati he
 Sarla also says that why did she go to meet Purab when she started talking about Abhi's music
 is par pragna sabhi ko puri ghatana ke bare main bataati he ki aalia ne use or purab ko abhi kii najaron main giraane ke liye yah sab kiya
 Pragya also tells them about East's plan but Sarla says that this plan will not be successful
 iske baad tanu or aalia pragna kaa majaak udaati hai
 Tanu says that now Abhi will be her, Pragya says that this will never happen
 vahiin aalia or tanu pragna or purab ke rishte kaa bi majaak udaati hai
 Aaliya says that when Purba said that he loves Pragya, she felt bad because sometimes she loved Poorab
 iske baad vah pragna se kahati he ki ab abhi usase nafrat karata he isliye use ghar chhodkar chale janaa chahie
 The comments pragna un donon se kahati he ki wo donon kitna bhi plan kar len uske or abhi ke bich koi nahin aa saktaa he
 Both of them will never succeed in separating them
 is bich purab abhi ke paas jaakar kahata he ki use ek baar uski baat sunani chahie
 But Abhi tells him that he does not want to talk to her
 iske baad vah khud ko blem karata he ki aakhir usne pragna par bharosa kyon kiya
 On the other hand, when Pragya returns home, Sarla asks her about Poorva and her pictures
 sarala yah bhi kahati he ki jab vah abhi ke sangeet main jane kii baat bolkar nikali thi to purab se milane kyon gai
 On this, Pragya tells everyone about the whole incident that Alia did all this to make her and Purab fall in Abhi's eyes

 48 crores have been spent
 white pales ko lekar raashtrapati kii jamkar aalochana ho rahi he
 Erdogan has also been the Prime Minister of Turkey for 11 years and now he is living in this palace named 'white Palace'
 mahal shuru se hi vivaadon main he
 It has been built on forest land in Ankara, the country's capital, while the court has prohibited construction work on forest land
 court ke pratibandh ke baavjood eradogan ne yah mahal banwaaya he
 The grandeur of the 'white Palace' can be gauged from the fact that this palace has 1,000 rooms
 is mahal ko 1 lakh 50 hajaar varg meter yani 16 lakh varg foot se bhi zyada jagah main banaaya gaya he
 Please tell that Rashtrapati Bhavan of India is built in 2 lakh square feet
 is tarah kii shahkharchi ko lekar eradogan kii desh or duniya main tikhi aalochana ho rahi he
 But irrespective of the criticisms, Erdo कहनाan says that no one can stop the construction of the building, if there is any strength, they should come forward and demolish it
 ’ mahal ko eradogan ke raashtrapati banane ke baad 30 agast ko kholaa gaya he
 It is being told that the cost of the palace has increased considerably due to the 250 private rooms for the President and thousands of trees from Italy
 khaas baat ye he ki ‘white pales’ france ke samraat lui chaudaaven ke mahal ‘varselis’ or britain ke shahi parivaar ke mahal ‘buckingham pales’ kii tulana main chaar guna zyada bada he
 According to Kemal Kilikadaroglu, leader of the opposition associated with the Republican People's Party of Turkey, "the so-called Sultan has built the palace for himself in a country where 3 million people are unemployed
" aapane saikadon pedo ko katkar apane liye mahal banwaaya he
 'it is not that Erdogan's royalty should be confined to the palace only
 unhone 1127 karod rupee kharch kar airbas se apane liye special jet vimaan bhi banwaaya he
 See the grandeur of the palace on the next page

 Bihar's political equations seem to be changing after a meeting between former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi and MP Pappu Yadav on Sunday
 kareeb ek ghante ke mulaakaat ke baad donon netaa jab media se rubaru hue to unka andaaj kuch alag tha
 Manjhi, showing eye to BJP, gave clear indications that if honorable things did not happen in seat sharing, then other avenues are open for him
 maanjhi kii is baat kaa matlab saaf he ki agar unhen siton ke bantwaare main nazarandaaj kiya gaya to ve endie se alag hokar bhi chunaav lard sakate hai or bijepi ko chhodkar congress kaa haath bhi tham sakate hai
 However, Manjhi also said that he and Pappu Yadav would fight together if the NDA did not come forward
 he
 'nobody is better than Manjhi' Jan Adhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav said that there cannot be a better chief ministerial candidate for Bihar than Jitan Ram Manjhi
 endie ko maanjhi ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar dena chahie
 After July 20, Faisal Manjhi said that the BJP has not yet fully negotiated the alliance
 seat bantwaare par abhi baatcheet honi he
 Whether or not Pappu Yadav will be included in the NDA is his personal decision
 20 july ke baad ham donon ke saath chunaav ladane par faisla hoga
 According to the inclusion formula in the NDA, Pappu Yadav can also join the NDA
 unki bijepi ke kuch kendriya netaaon se baatcheet chal rahi he
 However, Bihar BJP has differences over Pappu
 lekin party alaakaman kii dikkat yah he ki vah nitish-lalu-congress ke mahagathbandhan ke khilaaf majboot hokar hi utarana chaahati he
 'I will not be a voter', Pappu, an expert in politics, understands this very well, so he does not miss to warn the BJP
 unhone kaha, 'main votakatwa nahin banuunga
 Nor have i applied for leave
 lekin main kisi na kisi gathbandhan main laduunga
 If not BJP then Congress

 When this cancer victim went to her husband's house to get documents related to her treatment and documents related to her education, she refused to give anything

 She is also very happy after this that now she will be able to give her phd entrance examination too
