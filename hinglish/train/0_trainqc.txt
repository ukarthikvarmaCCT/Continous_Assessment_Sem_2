 ADJM Court will pronounce verdict in the case of Falahari Baba sexual exploitation in a case of rape of a disciple at Phalahari Babake Ashram, Ramkishan Colony under Kala Kuan area under Aravali Vihar police station area
 court ne mangalvaar ko falahari baba ke bachaav paksh ke vakeelon kii ore se antim bahes puri hone ke baad buudhvaar ko faisle kaa din nirdhaarit kiya he
 The final debate on both sides was completed in the court of Additional District and Sessions Court No
 1 Rajendra Sharma on Tuesday in the Alwar Keflahari Babarep case
 court main sarkari vakil yogendra khataana ne peedita ke paksh main bahes kii thi jisamen sarkari vakil main 376 / 2 (c) or 506 ipisi main jurm pramanit bataate hue doshi ko sajaa dene kii maang kii gai
 In the court, public prosecutor Yogendra Singh Khatana argued that the victim, accused Kaushalendra Prapanacharya alias Phaphalahari Babko, was treated as a father figure and there is sufficient evidence and witnesses to the act done on his behalf
 unhone kaha ki abhiyojan paksh kii antim bahes main nyaayalay main nivedan kiya gaya he ki aaropee ke khilaaf dhara 376 / 2 (c) or 506 ipisi ke tahat aparaadh bakhubi pramanit he
 In such a case, on the basis of the evidence, facts and witnesses available on the journal, the crime against both the accused is properly proved under both the sections
 84 din baad chargeshit filaisi sthiti main peedita aaropee ko pitatulya sangrakshak or bhagwaan maanati thi or internship ke liye jo check mila tha use apane bhagwaan swaroop baba falahari ko saunpane ke liye ai thi lekin baba ne uske saath jo krity kiya unhen adhik se adhik sajaa di jaani chahie
 In this case, the statements of the rape victim were recorded on 9 March 2018
 alvar ke aravali vihaar thana police ne falahari baba ke dwaara vilaspur kii yuvati se rape kiye jane ke maamle main 15 disambar 2017 ko 84 din baad asigeem court main chargeshit file kar di thi
 The police had presented a 40-page charge sheet in the court, in which the police have charged Baba guilty under sections 506 and 376 (2F)
 11 sitambar 2017 ko bilaspur kii 21 varshiya peedita nechhattisgarhke mahila thana main 0 number exiaar darj karwaai thi or baba ke khilaaf rape kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 After registering a zero FIR, the Chhattisgarh police had sent the file to the Alwar police by recording the victim's medical and 164 statements and making a false report, after which the Alwar police registered a case at the Aravali Vihar police station and started investigation
 isi dauraan falahari baba beemaari kaa bahaanaa bana kar ek nijee aspataal main bhartee ho gaya tha jahaan doctoron ke dwaara usko feet ghoshit kiye jane ke baad police ne 23 sitambar ko aspataal se giraftaar kar asigeem court 3 main pesh kiya or court ne baba ko 16 din kii nyaayik hiraasat main jail bhej diya tha
 Since then, Baba is in jail in judicial custody

 Today we are going to tell you such a news of an accident which will not only shock you, but will also make you think that there is not even death of humanity
 meerut kii sadak par accident ke baad ek beti do hisson main cat gai
 She was breathing and was saying the same thing over and over again - Mummy i love you, save me
 ' wo tadap rahi thi
 Mother was crying, but people were busy making videos of this accident from mobile
 meerut kii ek sadak par ghati is ghatana kii tasveeron ko ham aapako nahin dikhaa sakate hai, lekin ye haadasa aisa he, jahaan sadak durghatana ke baad ek beti kaa sharir do hisson main bant chukaa he
 The weeping mother crying helplessly for her daughter
 tab uski lado kii saans chal rahi thi
 She was speaking to her mother, i love you, with running breath
 mummy mujhe bachaa lo
 This was just a request
 maa kaa kalejaa fata ja rahaa tha
 Before knowing the whole story, you should strengthen your heart because to see and know this scene, it will be very important to control the emotions
 meerut ke hapur road shastrinagar chauraahey par hue sadak haadase ko jisane bhi dekha sihar uthaa
 Kanak Verma, studying in class X, had split into two pieces after being a victim of a road accident
 maa ko jaisi hi ghatana kii jaankaree mili, wo badahavaas apni bacchee ke paas pahunchi or awak rah gai
 It would not be impossible for any mother in the world to see her mother's image in this condition
 kisi bhayaavah sapane main bhi in tasveeron se vaasta nahin padaa hoga
 On seeing this piece of her heart, her mother was moved with pity
 maa kii lado jindagi se dur ja rahi thi
 Kanak Varma was beating
 wo apni maa ke kareeb jane kii koshish kar rahi thi
 The mother, who raised her baby in the womb for nine months, wanted to fill her dearly in the lap
 bacchee baar baar yahi bol rahi thi
 Mummy i love you mujhe bachaa lo
 This mother, who sacrificed all the aspirations of life on her daughter, looked helpless
 dil ko jhakzor dene vaala ye manjar tab saamne aayaa jab har roj kii tarah tution padhane ja rahi kanak sharma ko ek trek ne raste main kuchal diya
 Kanak was going on scooty with his grandfather but the wheel of the truck crushed him to death
 30 minute tak sharir sadak par padaa rahaa
 At the Hapur Road Shastri Nagar intersection of Meerut, every corner of the body shivers after seeing this scene
 jin bacchon ke sharir par ek kharonch tak se maa baap kii aah nikal jaati he
 Think, what would be going on the mother's heart when one of those mothers is suffering in front of her mother's eyes on the road in two parts
 maa kabhi apni gudiya ko dekhati
 Sometimes she used to turn her hand on the face of her lover
 kabhi god main bharne kii koshish karti
 The incident is on the evening of 24 May
 aadhe tak sadak par tadapane ke baad maa or bhai kanak ko lekar aspataal gaye
 But after some time, this girl from Meerut said goodbye to the world
 apni ankhon ke saamne apni jaan ko jate dekh maa kii jubaan bhi maddham pad gai he
 These pictures of the creepy pose have been made by someone present there, but the question is also asked to those who claim to be human but do not have any connection with humanity
 yah sawaal uthta he ki logon ne kanak verma ko aspataal kyon nahin pahunchaaya
 Why no one helped Kanak Verma's mother and brother
 kanak 30 minute tak sadak par tadapati rahi to kisi ne turant ambulance kii vyavastha kyon nahin kii
 Did people fear Kanaka's blood to spoil their clothes
 kisi bhi tamashbin ne kanak ke kareeb jaakar usase baat karke uski himmat kyon nahin badhaai
 Is the duty of the people completed only by making video

 It is worth mentioning that at that time, Home Minister Amit Shah was also present in the Rajya Sabha, but he gave the opportunity to both the young ministers

 Kishan Reddy informed that new labs are being built in Pune, Bhopal and Guwahati

So to answer this question, Amit Shah himself stood up and assured that after consulting the Jammu and Kashmir administration, he will be able to tell something about it

 test cricket kii sabase romaanchak series main ab zyada din nahin bache hai
 
 
 The first match of the Test series between India and Australia is going to start in Brisbane from 4 December
 
 
 lekin team india is daure ke liye ravaanaa ho, usase pehle hi australian kheme ne bharat par manovaigyanik dabaav bananaa shuru kar diya he
 
 
 According to former Australian fast bowler Glenn mcgrath, the host Australian team will beat guests India with a clean sweep
 
 
 jaahir he, glen maikgra intellegent dimag vaale cricketer rahe hai, so, agar vah kuch kah rahe hai to uski apni vajahen bhi hongi
 
 
 Since 1985, India has played 23 Test matches in Australia, but only two of them have managed to win
 bharat ne ye do test match bhi tab jite the, jab team india main sachin tendulkar, rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana jaise diggaj ballebaaz maujuud the, lekin is baar team india main is tarah kaa koi bharosemand ballebaaz najar nahin aa rahaa he
 
 
 By the way, both the teams are going through the same difficulty before the series starts, as Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will not be able to fit before the Brisbane Test, and on the other hand, Michael Clarke is also not scheduled to play in the first match
 
 
 itnaa hi nahin, abu dhabi main pakistan ke khilaaf australian team kaa pradarshan behad ausat rahaa, jabaki west indies team ke daura adhuraa chhodkar laut jane se team india ko test maichon ke abhyaas kaa mauka hi nahin mila
 
 
 Despite all these circumstances, sports enthusiasts are confident that a very exciting series will be seen between the two teams and the reason for this belief is the presence of highly talented players in both teams
 
 
 haalanki nishchit taur par palada mejabaan australia kaa hi baari dikh rahaa he, kyonki bhartiya team main anbhavi ballebaazon kaa abhaav he, or vaise bhi ve paramparaagat taur par bouns or seem ko behtareen dhang se nahin khel pate
 
 
 On the other hand, Australia have a trio of finest bowlers in the form of Mitchell Johnson, Ryan Harris and Peter Siddle
 
 
 australia daure ke liye chuni gai team india ke saamne behad mushkil chunauti isliye bhi hogi, kyonki yah team worldcup ko dhyaan main rakhkar chuni gai he, test muqablon ko dhyaan main rakhkar nahin
 
 
 So, it is difficult to face Australian bowlers on Australian pitches, but batsmen like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan and Cheteshwar Pujara also have the potential to make the challenge difficult

 " # positivevibes # happiness # desiqueen # talent # loveyourself # thaknamanahaia post shared bysapna Choudhary (@itssapnachoudhary) onfeb 8, 2019 at 1:04 am PST Explain that Sapna has made her Bollywood debut with the" side effects of film friendship "
 unki film 8 farvari ko relies hui
 Sapna is a tremendous dancer and singer
 unhone bhojpuri, hindi, punjabi, hariyaanvi cinema main kai item song kar chuki hai
 He got popularity from Bigg Boss
 is sho ke baad unakar mekaover dekhne ko mila
 On the other hand, if we talk about Tarak Mehta's inverted glasses, there is still suspense about the direction of Disha Wakani, who plays Dayaben
 lambey samay se wo sho se gaayab hai
 In 2017 she gave birth to a daughter, after which she took a break
 lekin wo abhi tak sho main waapas nahin ai hai
 There are also reports of his leaving the show
 main hindu nahin hum or sambhawatah kabhi banuun bhi nahin
 In the same way i am not Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Jain or even Sikh
 is baat kii bhi sambhaavna nahin he ki main kabhi inamen se koi ek ban jaaoongi
 But i believe that i have the right to know about these great traditions, admire and brainstorm on them
 ye mahaan paramparaayen mujhe sikhaati hai ki insaan hone kaa kya matlab he, duniya main apana jivan kaise jeena chahie, hamaare karm kaise hone chahie
 i am interested in what they teach me about death and what will happen after death
 main eemaandaaree se kah sakati hum mujhe har us dharm ne samrudh banaaya he jiskaa main paalan nahin karti, shaayad unamem se sabase zyada yogadan hindu dharm kaa rahaa he
 It is true that whatever attracts me here and there, i accept it (compassion from Buddhism, solicitation for justice from Judaism, sharing a part of my income from Islam essentially among the poor)
 is prakaar apana jivan jeene kaa ek saamanjasypurna or naitik maarg chunane kaa prayaas karti hum
 But i have chosen all this as a plum from somewhere
 hindu dharmamujhe mere astitv ke saath saakshaatkaar ko baadhya karata he—yah mujhe is baat par vichaar ke liye vivash karata he ki main apane rosemara ke jivan main kaisaa bananaa chaahati hum
 When i feel that i am the best, the idea of karma and dharma encourages me to churn it by making me aware of my deeds
 inamen se zyaadaatar mujhe is baat kaa samaran karaate hai ki main jo karm kar rahi hum, uske jo parinaam honge unka asar, mere alaava dusron par bhi hoga
 The excellent elasticity between karma and dharma rests in the heart of Hinduism
 har karm ke kuch parinaam honge
 Therefore, what is the basis of why we are doing what we are doing, Hinduism churns deeply on these things
 haalanki hamen is baat kii jaankaree nahin bhi ho sakati he ki jaise hi ham apane liye jo koi karm chunate hai, uske saath hi hamaare jivan main har pal kai nae uttardaayitv judate chale jate hai
 For example, at the same time we are mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, friends and teachers and jobbers, everything
 is tarah hamaari saamaajik, paariwarik, peshaagat bhoomikaayen hai
 Each of these roles requires us to follow a certain behavior, as well as certain expectations from us
 agar hamen ''acha" kahalaane kii laalasaa he to har bhoomika hamen kisi khaas tareeke se chalane ko vivash karegi
 In the Ramayana, Dasharatha was a king, a father and also a husband
 shriram ke rajbhishek se pehle kii us dukhadaayi raat ko kaikayi ne jo vardaan maanga, usase dasharath ke jivan ke in sabhi pakshon ke bich ek hi samay par jabardast takaraav hua
 If Dasaratha discharges one role appropriately, then the responsibilities he was tied to in the second role were bound to be encroached upon
 dasharath ne apni patni kii icchhaaen puri karte hue ram ko 14 saal kaa banavaas dekar khud ko ek ''acha" pati kahe jane kaa vikalp chunaa
 At the same time he turned his back on his deeds as a king and a father
 dasharath apane karmon ke saath lambey samay tak ji nahin paae
 Dasharatha gave up his life soon after his beloved son went to the forest
 duusari taraf, ram ne ayodhya se lautne ke baad apni patni kaa tyaag karke van main bhejne kaa jo karm kiya, uske parinaamon ke saath unhone jeevankaal bitaayaa
 Establishing a balance between what we want to do and what we should do is the greatest religion of being human
 hindu dharm main is sankat kii bauddhik, puranic or darshanik vyakhya he
 In the epics, the deities drive us out of these fundamental human illusions
 main bhagavadgita main krishna ke arjuna ke saath sargarbhit samvaad ke bare main sochati hum jo bhagwaan ke apane sarvaadhik shobhyman divyarup ko prakat karne or kisi manushya ke bhagwaan ke is divyarup ke saakshaat darshan ke saath ek uchit nishkarsh par purna hota he
 The Gita gives the most prominence to the dilemma of human karma, although i have not fully understood the parts of it and i do not support any rules of normal behavior that decide on the basis of social sequences (kshatriya religion) Go
 phir bhi main arjuna kii us duvidha ke bare main sochakar dravit ho jaati hum jab uske samaksh ekasmaan peedaadaayak do vikalp rakhe gaye honge tab unke man main kya chal rahaa hoga
 Krishna makes Arjuna aware of him, Krishna makes Arjuna out of the dilemma, in a sense, by making him realize the actions that are expected of Arjuna
 jab main apane vyaktigat jivan main kathin paristhitiyon kaa saamana kar rahi hoti hum, tab main apane liye usee prakaar kii spashtataa chaahati hum—apane vartmaan se upar uthakar khud ko viraat paridrishy main rakhkar dekhne kii kshamta
 i am encouraged to know that such clarity is possible, whether it comes from God or comes from a new understanding within me
 pichley dashakon main hamaare saath jo hua he uske bare main sochakar bhi ab krodh ke sthaan par behisaab pidaa hoti he
 The Valmik Ramayana with which i have spent thirty years, who can talk and what to talk about this book, such restrictions are being imposed
 ham aksar or zyada joardaar aawaaj main yahi baat sun rahe hai ki bas ek hi ramayana he (or, jaisaa ki hota rahaa he, yah vaalmik nahin he); bharatiyon ke alaava or kisi ko iske vishay main kehane kaa adhikaar nahin he; hindu ke atirikt or kisi ko yah sochane-vichaarne kii anumati nahin di ja sakati ki katha or iske paatro kaa taatpary kya ho saktaa he; ram or sita evam anya ko maanviya sansar main rahane ke dauraan kis prakaar ke kashton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, isaki kalpana karke bhavuk hone kaa adhikaar ek aastik hindu ke alaava or kisi ko nahin, ek bhakt ke alaava or kisi ko ram se sachcha prem karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Politically motivated urban thugs who have become the watchdogs of culture are forcing such restrictions by threats and physical violence
 sabase vichlit karne vaali baat to bauddhik jagat main rashtravaadiyon kaa badhata vah kunba he jo paashchaatya vidwaanon par hindutv kaa dwarpal hone (kathith rup se bharat ke sthaan or drushtikon ko hinabhav main pradarshit karte hai) kaa aarope lagaataa rahaa he, ab vahi dharm or usase judi chizon kaa abhibhavak ban baitha he
 These aggressive cultural nationalists have become self-proclaimed defenders of Hinduism
 ham1
 3 Arabs may say that Hinduism is pluralistic but Hindutva is bizarre
 yah bhed tab arthhin ho jaataa he jab hindu dharm ke nae sthaneey dwarpal or hindu raashtra ke prabal samarthak yah elaan kar dete hai ki maanav vichaaron or anubhavon ke us vishaal khajaane tak pahunchakar uskaa laabh keval vahi le saktaa he jise ve anumati denge
 i grew up listening to the story in which i was told that if you look at the moon carefully, you will see the image of a man
 jab maine sanskrit padhuya shuru kiya to maine janaa ki chandramaa to mrigank he, uski god main mrigon kaa vaas he
 But now on the full moon of 2018, i can only see deer
 vah purush to lupt ho chukaa he

 The political battle seems to be intensifying to make a place in the heart of the voters in the state of Uttar Pradesh
 bijepi 15 sitambar ko lakhanu main yadav sammelan kar rahi hai
 At the same time, the war between Shivpal Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav, who broke away from SP and became leader of Yadav community, has intensified
 shivpal yadavasamajawaadee secular morchabanane ke baad pehali baar lakhanu main ek bade kaarykram main shaamil honge
 The program is being organized by Yadav community organization Shri Krishna Vahani on 11 September
 shivpal is kaarykram main mukhya atithi ke taur par shaamil honge
 Shri Krishna Vahani general secretary Ashok Yadav told 'aaj Tak' that the program to be held on September 11 will decide a lot
 khaskar upi ke yadav samaaj ke raajnneetik bhavishya ko lekar
 He said that Shivpal Yadav will be the chief guest in the program and many people of Yadav society will attend it
 is sammelan main jis tarah yadav samudaay ke logon ko khaskar bulaayaa ja rahaa he
 This means that Shivpal, on the pretext of Shri Krishna Vahini, wants to test his political hold among the Yadav society
 kaarykram ke mahasachiv kaa saaf kahana he ki 11 sitambar ko kai raajnneetik faisle kadam uthaae jaaenge
 In fact, Yadav community has the largest number of OBC community in Uttar Pradesh

 Lenovo on Friday announced the launch of its next 'killer Note' on social media channel on August 9
 isse pehle company ne iske liye video tiger jari kiya tha
 The post shows the number 8, which indicates that this smartphone will be Lenovo K8 Note
 jabaki pehle K7 Note ke launch hone kii ummid lagaai ja rahi thi
 Lenovo India has revealed the official launch date after a series of math quizzes on its social media account
 is quij main folbers ko agle 'note' smartphone ke naam kaa andaja lagane ko kaha gaya tha
 The company has almost made it clear that the next smartphone will be Lenovo K8 Note and the K7 Note is going to skip
 isse pehle oneplus ne bhi oneplus 3T ke baad oneplus 5 ko launch kar diya tha, haalanki usamen alag kaaran shaamil the

 As a reminder, only the single camera was given in the Lenovo K6 Note
 isliye ye kuch had tak mumkin ki company isamen dual camera seoup de
 According to leaked news, K8 Note Android 7

 1 will run on nougat and 1 in it
 4ghz mediatek Helio X20 procesar diya jayega
 Also, information has also come out that 4 GB of RAM will be given in it
 bihar kesupaulamen chhedhkhani kaa virodh karne par kuch manchalon dwaara ladakiyon kii buree tarah pitayee karne kaa maamla abhi shant bhi nahin hua tha ki najdiki saharsa jile se ladakiyon ke saathchhedchhadka ek or maamla saamne aayaa he
 The fear of the domineering can be gauged from the fact that about 3 dozen girl students in the village have stopped going to school
 bhai kaa tod diya haathyah maamla saharsa ke simari bakhtiyarpur thane ke tahat ekapadhaha gaanv kaa he jahaan par beete 4 oktober ko skool ja rahi chaatraon ke saath bagal ke gaanv ke manchalon ne raste main chhedchhad kii
 Being fed up with this has left the girls to go to school
 jab ek chaatra ke bhai ne maukey par chhedchhad kaa virodh kiya to manchalon ne uski jamkar pitayee bhi kii or uskaa haath tod diya
 Actually, Ekpadha village does not have a single high school, due to which the daughters of the village have to go to Simri Bakhtiarpur, 7 km away
 har roj kii tarah subah 9:30 baje gita (badla hua naam) apni do anya saheliyon ke saath cycle par baithkar simari bakhtiyarpur ja rahi thi jab raste main har din kii tarah chhipakar baithe manchalon ne uske saath chhedchhad kii
 Meanwhile, Geeta's younger brothers Ramesh and Rajesh (both changed names) were returning to the village after some shopping from Simri Bakhtiyarpur, when they saw Manchalak's behavior with his sister and his friends when they opposed it
 lekin lafangon ne unke saath hi marpet kar di, jinamein se ek bhai kaa haath tut gaya
 Manchal escaped after the assault
 is ghatana se gaanv kii anya ladkiyaan itani dehshat main hai ki unhone agle din se skool janaa hi chhod diya
 When Aaj Tak reached this village, the fear of girls came to the fore
 is maamle kii jaankaree milane ke baad ajtak ekapadhaha gaanv pahunchaa or ladakiyon se baatcheet kii
 Geeta told that from the time she studied in ninth grade, she used to go to school with her friends by cycling and used to manipulate them on the way
 gita ne bataaya ki manachale unhen gandi-gandi gaaliyaan diya karte the, ashleel tippanee kiya karte the or ashleel bhojpuri gane sunaaya karte the jisase vah kaaphi maansik sadame main rahaa karti thi
 Geeta told that the incident of molestation by her and her friends had been going on for the last 4 years, but everyone feared that if they informed their parents about this, they would stop going to school
 But eventually it happened
 karrwai kii maangaek chaatra sneha (badla hua naam) ne bataaya agle saal in logon ke 12veen ke board kii pariksha he or aise main skool nahin ja paane kii vajah se unke padhai kaa kaaphi nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Sneha demanded from Chief Minister Nitish Kumar that he should take action in this entire matter so that the girls of the village can go to school again
 manchalon ke khauf se gaanv ke takreeban 3 darjan betiyon ne ek saptaah se skool janaa chhod diya he
 Geeta's mother said that she is afraid that today they only do vulgar things and manipulate them, but tomorrow someone else can do wrong things with them
 isi vajah se vah aap apni beti ko skool nahin jane de rahi he
 FIR lodged, not action, what is indifferent in this case is that the victim girl and her brother had lodged an FIR at Simri Bakhtiyarpur police station on October 4, but no police officer would visit the village to investigate the matter
 Did not arrive jaise hi ajtak kii team 8 oktober ko yahaan pahunchi, police prashasan main jaise hadakamp much gaya or aanan-fanan main aropiyon kii dharpakad ke liye karwaai kii gai
 However, so far no arrests have been made in this case

 Politics in Delhi has taken a new turn and Arvind Kejriwal, who is going to become the new Chief Minister, has reached the chair of the Chief Minister riding on the anti-corruption wave and further he is claiming to fight corruption

 But in Delhi Secretariat, all the chairs have started moving before time
 aaj tak ko pataa laga ki jate hue mantriyon ke staff or kai gopneey vibhaagon main filein or dastavej khatm kiye ja rahe hai
 Chips are being torn from the files, and tables and cupboards of officers are being cleaned
 aaj tak kii khufia team camera lekar jaise hi shila sarkaar ke ek dabang mantri arvinder singh lavali ke daftar main ghusi, to vahaan kaa najaara chaunkaane vaala tha

 The truth is that the fear of Kejriwal is now haunting everyone

 It is clear that if the corruption spread in the Jal Board is stopped, it will be possible for Kejriwal to fulfill his promise

 After taking Kejriwal's name, a Delhi motor licensing officer started calling himself bigger than Kejriwal
 unhone kaha ki wo bhrashtachar se sand kii tarah lard rahe hai
 There is a stir in the social welfare department in the name of Kejriwal and the officers are assuming that the corrupt officers are going to fall foul
 kuch or adhikari bhi hai, jo khud ko aam aadmi party kaa samarthak bataa rahe hai or maanate hai ki kejariwal ke aane se kahin naa kahin fark aayega
 DTC officials are also surprised and upset about Kejriwal

 India, who have already won the series, would like to end the series with a win in the fifth and final ODI against England on Sunday
 shrunkhlaa main 4-1 kii jeet ke saath bhale hi england ke khilaaf test shrunkhlaa main haar ke ghaav nahin bharenge, lekin nishchit taur par maaikel clark kii australian team ke khilaaf test siries se pehle mahendra singh dhoni kii team india kaa manobal badhegaa
 Captain Dhoni must have been feeling quite good too, as he has done well in the series and has shown more responsibility
 dhoni nishchit taur par chahenge ki bharat jab desh ke 43wein antarrashtriya aayojan sthal par utre, to bhartiya team pichley teen maichon kii form ko barkaraar rakhe, jahaan usne virdohi team ko aasaani se haraaya
 India have already taken a decisive 3–1 lead in the series, making Sunday's match a mere formality, but the team management and national selectors will have to focus on certain departments
 cheteshwar pujaara ko ekadivasiy padaarpan kaa intjaar he or saurashtra ke is ballebaaj ko antat: yah mauka mil saktaa he, kyonki unhen mumbai ke khilaaf ranjai trophy final ke liye bhi relies nahin kiya gaya he
 Dhoni usually prefers to come up with a tested combination and it will be interesting to see if Pujara and Amit Mishra, who have been sitting on the bench so far, get a chance to show their skills
 captain ne pichley match main rohit sharma se pari kii shuruyaat karne kaa daanv khelaa tha, jo chal padaa
 In view of this, the pressure has increased on the second opener Gautam Gambhir and this Delhi batsman will have to take full advantage of the opportunity, because he might not get much opportunity ahead
 tippaniyan Ajinkya Rahane, who failed to play big innings in the first three odis, may have been out of the playing XI in the last match, but this young player is expected to get more opportunities in the future
 agar rohit salaami ballebaaj kii bhoomika main feet ho jate hai or rahane ko or adhik maukey dene kaa faisla kiya jaataa he, to sambhavat: gambhir ke paas aane vaale kuch samay ke liye simit overon ke maichon main antim mauka ho saktaa he
 Suresh Raina has started playing the role of a good finisher, while Virat Kohli would like to end the series with an innings like Ranchi

 While a 4–1 win in the series may not heal the wounds of the loss in the Test series against England, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team India's morale will certainly increase before the Test series against Michael Clarke's Australian team
 captain dhoni bhi kaaphi acha mahasoos kar rahe honge, kyonki unhone siries main acha pradarshan kiya he or adhik jimmedaari bharaa khel dikhaaya he
 Dhoni would surely like that when India landed at the 43rd international venue of the country, the Indian team would retain the form of the last three matches, where they easily defeated the opposing team
 bharat pehle hi shrunkhlaa main 3-1 kii nirnaayak badhat le chukaa he, jisase ravivaar ko hone vaala match mahaj aupchaarikta kaa he, lekin team prabandhan or rashtriya chayankartaaon ko kuch vibhaagon par dhyaan dena hoga
 Cheteshwar Pujara is awaiting his ODI debut and the Saurashtra batsman may finally get this chance, as he has not even been released for the Ranji Trophy final against Mumbai
 dhoni aamtaur par jaanche-parakhe sangyojan ke saath utarane ko hi tarjeeh dete hai or ise dekhte hue yah dekhnaa rochak hoga ki ab tak bainch par baithe rahane vaale pujaara or amit mishra ko apana kaushal dikhaane kaa mauka miltaa he yaa nahin
 In the last match, the captain had played the stakes to start the innings with Rohit Sharma, which went on
 ise dekhte hue duusare salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir par dabaav bad gaya he or dilli ke is ballebaaj ko maukey kaa puraa phayda uthaanaa hoga, kyonki shaayad unhen aage adhik mauk nahin mili

 If Rohit fits into the role of the opener and decides to give Rahane more chances, Gambhir may possibly have the last chance in limited-overs matches for some time to come
 suresh raina achche finishr kii bhoomika main khare utarane lage hai, jabaki viraat kohli ranchi jaisi pari khelkar siries kaa acha ant karnaa chahenge

 Despite the objections of senior leaders Lal Krishna Advani and Sushma Swaraj, Modi was made the head of the campaign committee
 adwani ne to virodh-swaroop party ke sabhi padon se istipha bhi de diya tha par rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke pramukh mohan bhagwat ke dakhal ke baad unhone istipha waapas le liya tha
 The JDU, which had been a constituent of the NDA for nearly 17 years, had parted ways with the alliance, as it was feared that Modi's progress would drive his Muslim voters away from him
 sansadeey board kii aaj hui baithak main doshasiddh saansadon or vidhayakon ke mudde par laae gaye adhyadesh par bhi charchaa kii gai
 Kumar said that the party requested the President of India not to sign it

 Ever since Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was made the General Secretary of the Congress, different statements of leaders of opposition parties have been coming out
 ab madhya pradesh bijepi ke vidhayak rameshwar sharma ne gandhi parivaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He has said that the Gandhi family is constantly ignoring Jyotiraditya Scindia
 priyanka gandhi ko congress mahasachiv banaakar purvi uttar pradesh kii kaman saunpi gai he jabaki party mahasachiv banaakar jyotiraditya sindhiya ko pashchim upi kii jimmedaari di gai he
 Speaking to 'aaj Tak' MLA from Bhopal's Huzur Assembly seat, Rameshwar Sharma said, 'when a worker who works continuously has to be ignored then he has to consider it
 madhavrao sindhiya kii maut ke baad jyotiraditya sindhiya lagaataar sangharsh kar rahe hai
 At first he felt that he would get a proper place after the death of his father, but this did not happen
 jab jyotiraditya sindhiya kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil kiye gaye to rajyamantri kaa darja mila
 Further Rameshwar Sharma said that many Congress mlas were also demanding that Scindia be made the state president
 lekin tab bhi unhen pradesh adhyaksh nahin banaaya gaya
 Now when Scindia was made the general secretary, with the name of Priyanka Gandhi, he disappeared from the posters of congratulations
 ' rameshwar sharma ne kaha ki 'isse saaf hota he ki 'jyotiraditya sindhiya kii qurbaani kar di gai
 "scindia became slave of sister-brother" - BJP MLA After this Rameshwar Sharma made a big charge, saying that "jyotiraditya Scindia did not get publicity nor dignity of post

 isi tarah, priyanka ko congress kii sakriy raajnneeti main le aayaa jaataa he
 He said that the Congress does not have strong leaders to contest the next Lok Sabha elections
 isliye vah aise chocolati chehron ke madhyam se chunaav ladanaa chaahati he
 If Congress had confidence in Rahul Gandhi's leadership, Priyanka would not have been brought into active politics

 However, there are political considerations behind it
 congress nahin chaahati he ki gujarat main jin muddon ko lekar wo bijepi par haaavee he, charchaa usase diawart ho
 The second reason is that in the past, the statements of Congress leaders have become a bone in his throat
 gujarat dangon ke baad 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi ko lekar bayaan diya tha

 ab piemo ne maaran ke khilaaf dobaaraa file kholane ke aadesh die hai
 In fact, for the first time, the Modi government is opening such a file, which CBI Director Ranjit Sinha talked about closing
 modi sarkaar ko lag rahaa he ki manmohan sarkaar ke daur main mantri ko bachaane ke liye sibiai diarector ranjit sinha ne apane hi adhikariyon kii jaanch ke ulat note likhe
 The case involves the manipulation of crores through the aircel-maxim deal
 tab sanchaar mantri dayaanidhi maaran ke khilaaf jaanch roki gai thi
 The Modi government's stance has raised questions on the note of the CBI director, who wrote the opposite notes of the CBI investigation team
 sawaal yah bhi khadaa ho gaya he ki aakhir sibiai diarector maaran ko kyon bachaa rahe the
 Rejecting the CBI Director's opinion, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said that the investigating agency has enough evidence to file a charge sheet against former Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran and his brother Kalanithi Maran in the aircel-maxis deal
 haalanki, sibiai sutron ne kaha he ki agency ko abhi tak atarni general kii raay nahin mili he or agency is maamle main unki raay ke anusaar chalegi
 The case was referred to the Attorney General due to differing views of the investigation team and CBI Director Ranjit Sinha regarding the charge sheet on the Raymaran brothers
 jahaan jaanch team kaa maananaa tha ki maaran bandhuon kii bhoomika ke bare main paryaapt saboot hai, vahiin sibiai nideshak ranjit sinha kii is par alag raay thi

 Riding on the same date of history, Yogguru Baba Ramdev is starting his movement against corruption
 jis ramlila maidan se pichley saal anna hajaare ne agast kranti kii thi, usee ramlila maidan se ramdev apni agast kranti shuru kar rahe hai
 Will Ramdev be able to raise the mass movement on the board of politics or will his movement also fall in the face of Anna's fast
 in sawaalon ke jawaab yogaguru baba ramdev manch se hi dene vaale hai
 Last June, at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, Baba Ramdev, who has been burnt with government milk, is also drinking buttermilk this time, so he used to work in the name of solitude in the Karmsad, Gujarat, 3 days before the movement
 
 philhal swami ramdev ne 3 muddon kaa prakshepastra sarkaar kii taraf oochaal diya he
 The first issue is Jan Lokpal, the second issue is the autonomy of the CBI and the third issue is of black money
 swami ramdev ne apane andolan ke liye ramlila maidan main puri taiyaari karwaai he
 Arrangements have been made for 30 thousand people at Ramlila Maidan
 andolan-sthal par 5 daravaaje banaae gayi hai
 CCTV will be under surveillance everywhere
 parking or logon ke khaane-pine kaa bhi intjaam kar liya gaya he
 Last year, the yoga guru trapped in the midnight police circle Chakravyuh has also made strict security cover for his volunteers
 ramdev or unke samarthakon ko yakeen he ki is tamzam par savaar hokar unka andolan sarkari kile ko bhedane main kaamyaab rahegaa, lekin sawaal he ki ramdev ke andolan kaa charitra kya hoga
 Ramdev has not yet clarified whether he will sit on hunger strike or take his protest to the ears of the government on fast or fast
 yah bhi saaf nahin he ki unka andolan kab tak or kis shakl main chalegaa
 It is obvious that Ramdev will have to decide a long way to succeed in his cause
 kaledhan se shuru hua ramdev kaa andolan ab janalokapal se lekar sibibai kii swaittata kii maang tak pahunch gaya he, lekin is andolan kii ruparekha kisi hogi, ye saaf nahin he
 Ramdev is also not opening his cards
 swami ramdev jab media se mukhaatib hue, to asamanjas paidaa ho gaya ki ye ramdev kaa agenda he yaa anna hazaare kaa
 Swami Ramdev, who was holding the government for the last year to bring back 4 lakh crores of black money in Ramlila Maidan itself, is now putting more emphasis on eradicating corruption
 pichhali baar andolan main unke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar chalane vaale sahyogi acharya baalkrishna farzivaade ke ilzaam main jail main hai
 This Swami Ramdev also knows that this time the government is not going to miss any opportunity to counter him
 kahin satta ke hamale se bachane ke liye hi to baba ramdev ne narendra modi kaa gungan to nahin shuru kiya? koun nahin jaanata ki centre sarkaar or congress ko sabase tagdi lalkaar or fatkaar narendra modi se hi milti he
 This time Ramdev is keeping the suspense of his movement
 ramdev kisi ko bhi bataane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai ki ramlila maidan main kya hoga? wo anshan karenge yaa satyagrah?pichhali baar se sabak sikhkar hi shaayad isbaar ramdev sarkaar ko vakt se pehle apni ranneeti kii bhanak nahin lagane dena chaahate

 bharat ne seemaa par khuraafaat karne vaale china ko ek baar phir se kadi chetavanee di he
 Indian Ambassador to China Gautam Bambawale said in a strict tone that if China tried to change the status quo on the border, then situations like Doklam dispute would arise
 unhone kaha ki china ko doklam vivaad se sabak lenaa chahie or seemaa par yathasthiti main kisi bhi tarah ke badlaav kaa prayaas katai nahin karnaa chahie
 In an interview to the Chinese newspaper South China Morning Post during the Hong Kong visit, Bambawale said that there are no boundaries between India and China, which is a serious problem
 bambaawale ne kaha ki donon deshon ko seemaa nirdhaarit karne ke liye jald kadam uthaane chahie, taaki seemaa par shanti or sthirataa sthapit kii ja sake
 He also said that there should be open and clear dialogue between the two countries to maintain peace and better coordination on the border

 india-china forces should openly negotiate The Indian Ambassador said that there is good dialogue between PM Modi and the Chinese President at a high level, but there should be dialogue at a lower level as well

 Negotiations between the military headquarters of the two countries have not started since the Doklam dispute

 The Indian Ambassador said that the Chinese Army had changed the status quo at Nedoklam, after which India responded to it
 chini sena dwaara seemaa par yathasthiti badalane kii vajah se hi bharat ne pratikriya di thi
 If the status quo changes, then the situation will be like Doklam
 The reason for the deadlock in Doklam last year was that the two countries were not openly talking to each other
 maaloom ho ki pichley saal donon deshon kii senaayen doklam main aamane-saamne aa gai thim
 This standoff between the two countries lasted for 73 days
 bambaawale ne kaha ki bharat-china seemaa par kuch khaas kshetra hai, jo behad samvedansheel hai
 The status quo should not change in these areas
 agar koi badlaav karata he, to isse doklam gatirodh jaisi hi sthiti paidaa ho jaaegi
 The Indian Ambassador said that if the border is going to make a Chinese road, then it should inform India
 agar bharat isse sahamat nahin hoga, to fouran jawaab degaa ki aap yathasthiti main badlaav kar rahe hai
 Do not do this yah kaaphi samvedansheel kshetra he

 The Supreme Court today proposed the name of Sunil Gavaskar as the BCCI President in place of n Srinivasan and the legendary batsman said that he would be 'happy' and 'honored' following the instructions of the country's top court
 vahiin, sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki bisisiai sunil gavaskar ko antarim adhyaksh banane ke virodh karegi
 Sources say that the BCCI will plead in the court that the BCCI has its own rules and laws and cannot hold any outsider in this way
 gavaskar ne kaha, pehali baat to agar sheersh adaalat kuch suzav detaa he to aapako aisa karnaa chahie, lekin yah record par hona chahie
 i currently have a contract with the BCCI as a commentator, but if the Supreme Court wants it, i will do so
 unhone ‘enditivi’ se kaha, jab supreme court aapse kahata he to iske bare main koi sawaal hi nahin uthta, aap iske bare main kuch nahin kar sakate or ve mujhe jo kuch karne ke liye kahenge, mujhe aisa karne main khushi hogi
 Former Indian captain Gavaskar said he would wait for the court's final order

 But we have to wait till tomorrow to see what the order is

 Asked if he is ready for the challenge, Gavaskar said, "as an opener you should be ready for every kind of challenge, you have to play on all kinds of pitches, you always have to be mentally and physically challenged
" You are ready
 unhone kaha, aaj bhi main haalanki sukhiryon se dur rahakar hi khush hum, lekin agar supreme court mujhase kuch karana chahta he to main jarurat ke mutabik taiyaar hum

 These will be part of a legally valid intercept policy and major privacy changes
 is tarah ke kendriya virutap kii anumati dene kaa adhikaar dene vaale pillai ko rojaanaa is tarah ke saikadon aavedan praapt hote hai jinamein electronic nigaraanee kii maang kii jaati he
 Most of the requests come from the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Income Tax Department, CBI, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and Directorate of Repatriation (ED) 
 inke alaava rajya agenciyon se bhi anurodh aate rahete hai jinhen centre shasit kshetron main phone tanping ke liye grih mantralay kii anumati kii jarurat hoti he
 Law enforcement agencies can tap phones without first week permission
 iske baad, tanping sirf majboot cese banane ke baad hi kii ja sakati he
 In fact, weak arguments work
 aparaadh, aatankwaad parichit aadhaar hai lekin jo kisi ko tang karne ke bahustareey avasar muhaiyaa karaate hai
 Each state can monitor an average of two to three thousand phones at any given time
 phone tanping asangathit he
 Various agencies tap phones in their own way
 kai baar to ek mobile number par rajya or centre kii kai agenciyaan najar rakh rahi hoti hai
 The problem becomes even more acute due to the abundance of state-of-the-art equipment and lack of a central database
 kuch vishesh kanoonon main chhodkar, virutap ko sirf sahaayak sakshya ke taur par istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 But tapping is so easy that it has become the first resort for law enforcement officers
 ek upaay ke taur par phone tanping par badhate bharose ke chalate nigaraanee mahakama majboot hi hone ko he
 Social activists advocate an American system where the judge has the authority to allow wiretaps only after examining the evidence
 purv mukhya nyaayadhish rajinder sachhar kehete hai, ''naagarik swadhinata kaaphi mahatvapurn he or use karypalika yaa grih sachiv ke upar nahin choda ja saktaa
 There is a full danger of wrong permitting here, which can result in biased tapping
 ''phone tanping ko bhartiya telegraph kanoon kii dhara 5 ke saamaanya praavdhaanon ke tahat manjuuri di jaati he, lekin aisa sirf ''saarvajanik aapatkaal yaa jan suraksha ke liye hi kiya ja saktaa he
 The Supreme Court in 1997 laid down five reasons for tapping the dialogue in response to Justice Sachar's plea - national sovereignty and unity, security of the state, friendly relations with other countries, maintaining public order or overcoming crime For the sake

 P
 singh kehete hai, ''kar chori or bhrashtachar ke asaadharantam maamalon main hi phone tanping kii jaani chahie
 "only seven central agencies are authorized for phone tapping - IB, ED, Delhi Police, CBI, DRI, Central Economic Intelligence Bureau and Narcotics Control Bureau
 ibi ke purv nideshak arun bhagat kehete hai, ''phone tanping kanoonee hathiyaar he
 It should be kept under the safe supervision of the court or only few officers should have access to it

 This officer denied the facility of government residence for the luxurious and comfortable guesthouse of friend and co-accused Vineet Kumar
 unke phone kol kii nigaraanee kii gai to unhen ''ukraini or roosi softevayar'' ke bare main baat karte suna gaya, yah veshyaaon ke liye code tha
 Hotels were called hardware while bribes were called laddoos
 un par america kii telecom company telecordia ko mobile number portability ke liye manjuuri dene kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 It is believed that a dozen other bureaucrats have also been kept under surveillance for these reasons
 lekin prayek kanoonee maamle main saikadon avaidh virutap ko anjaam diya jaataa he
 Five years ago, a Mumbai newspaper had published a detailed conversation with actor Salman Khan
 sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki tepe main maujuud aawaaj khan kii nahin he
 In this way an attempt was made to cover up illegal phone tapping
 baatcheet shahar kii aparaadh shakha se li hui thi
 Four private detectives were arrested in 2005 for illegally obtaining phone records of SP leader Amar Singh
 lekin tab kya jab avaidh rup se tap kii gai baatcheet galat kaam kaa sakshya ban jaae? adhikari kehete hai ki grih sachiv se pichhali taarikh kaa aavedan maanga jaataa he
 Each agency has to fill an authority slip before taking the phone under surveillance
 rajyon main, rajya ke grih sachiv in par hastakshar karte hai
 Officially, leaders' phones cannot be tapped — there is a special mention on the slip that the person whose phone will be tapped should not be elected by the public
 cellular phonon ke aagaman se purv, rajya kii agenciyaan telephone pole se samaantar line leti thim, uske aasapaas hi rahane kii vyavastha karti thim yaa phir ve khanabadoshon kii tarah tambu lagaakar rahete the
 Often the person being targeted came to know about the problem in the phone

 Cellphones gave momentum and clout to the organized crime syndicate
 conection farji naam se bhi liya ja saktaa he
 In the mid-1990s, operators were not fully prepared to keep records of calls
 nigaraanee ke pehle maamle main, uttar pradesh special task force (estf) ke dipti suparintendent rajesh pandey ne elahabaad main ek telecom ejeeniyar se tiperiter ke aakaar kaa intercepshan box taiyaar karavaaya tha
 The box was kept close by and connected to the switching station
 aaj, cellular seva uplabdh karaane vaali prayek company kaa ek agrigeshan stesan hota he jo sarvaron ko jodne vaala hota he
 This is called mediation servers because they mediate between cellular operators and law enforcement agencies
 inke jariye phonon ko tap kiya jaataa he
 There are two types of interception facilities - Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Li
 ja line
 Under ISDN, the mediation server intercepts the call, and then transmits it through the Primary Rate Interface (PRI) to the government agency's office
 police piarai line par phone ko sun sakati he or usase jude computer main recording store kar sakati he
 Simultaneously, the sound file of the caught call is also recorded and stored on the mediation server
 iesdn main, kol se sambandhit data vaastavik samay main hastantarit nahin hota
 Due to the slow speed of 64 kbps it takes 2 -3 minutes
 data packet terafic main kho jaataa he or kol piarai line tak nahin pahunch paati he
 Lee
 ja line main, sarvice uplabdh karaane vaali company agency ko fast speed vaale fibre optic cabel conection ke jariye apane mukhya network tak pahunch muhaiyaa karaati he
 The data related to the call is not only transferred in real time, with an electric speed of 2 Mbps, there is very less chance of any call being missed
 lekin fibre optic cabel conection kii laagat adhik aane se rajya kii agenciyaan iesdn linon par nirbhar rahati hai
 The service provider can provide up to eight agencies at any time to catch the call of a number
 nigaraanee kii saamaanya vidhiyon main vyakti ke kol ke data record (sidiaar) yaa phir dial yaa risive kiye gaye numberon kii suchi ko diya janaa shaamil rahata he
 Government permission is not required for this
 vishesh software ke jariye, sidiaar teji se 'relationships tree' yaa charts kaa nirmaan kar detaa he, jo hajaaron kaalon main sambandhon ko dikhaata he
 Technology is an attack on privacy

 In one of his taped conversations, Neera Radia, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M
 karunanidhi kii patni rajati ke chartered accountint ko apane tata ducomo ke number par kol karne ke liye kaha tha
 Legally, a phone can be tapped only if the telecom service company is informed in writing
 jaahir he radia apane graahak tata dwaara uplabdh karaae gaye number par adhik surakshit mahasoos karti hongi
 It is no surprise that Radia's Idea and mtnl's phones can be tapped
 anil ambani ke sahyogi tony jesudasana reliance cell -phone numberon ko hi prayog main laa rahe the
 Sources reveal that the Income Tax Department and CBI wanted to tap Jesudasan's phone but decided against it for obvious reasons
 is kahani main ek pech he
 a large number of surveillance devices were purchased to monitor organized crime and terrorism, but intelligence agencies are regretting that phone tapping and listening to messages are not having any significant results as terrorists have increasingly started using blackberry phones While his mentor is using the new generation Inmarsat-4 satellite phone
 isse unke phone bich main sunanaa philhal naammumkin-sa ho gaya he
 Although INMARSAT-4 phones can be captured, but this conversation will be found in code format only
 aawaaj or data kii prabhavi dhang se nigaraanee to landan or neuyork sthit inmarsat-4 switch par kii ja sakati he
 There it is available in a codeless format
 yahi vajah he ki soochna ke liye bharat ab bhi british or america khufia agenciyon par nirbhar he
 Militants, small-time criminals and business houses also use voice-over Internet telephony (VOIP) -based Skype and Google Mail as well as chat
 kol or mail ko inkript karne vaale muft ke software aadhunik handset or computaron par downlod kiye ja sakate hai
 Commercially available software such as cellcrypt has been found to be most effective for securing conversations and messages
 sabhi smartphonon ke anukool baithne vaala selcript sabhi tarah kii baatcheet ko nijee str par kutabaddh kar detaa he
 This software should be installed on both sides of the handset for completely secure communication
 agar ek hi handset main yah laga he to duusare chor par baatcheet bina kutabaddh swaroop main uplabdh hogi
 The Home Ministry is now putting up a server, which can be called 'big Brother Server'

 kii laagat vaala phone or data nigaraanee kaa ek kendrikrut centre
 The coming into existence of this center will increase the synergy between the seven agencies authorized to tap phones and even the states
 grih mantralay ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''isse aankadon ko ek jagah par laakar baariki se unke adhyayan-vishleshan main saliyat hogi or kendriya agenciyon ko thos khufia suchanaaen mil paaengi
 "this will also provide data on tapping phones across the country
" is nigaraanee pranali se rajya ke chote shahar-kasbe rajdhani se jud paaenge or sabhi rajyon kii rajdhaniyaan fibre optic cabals ke jariye dilli sthit kendriya nigaraanee ikai se jud jaaengi
 The IB can monitor any phone from anywhere in Delhi
 local switchboard se judane ke kaaran dilli kaa yah centre rajyon ke liye bhi tanping prakriya ko or aasaan bana saktaa he
 In the official's words, "this will also increase the responsibility of the service provider as he will be forced to provide relevant talks
" '' iske tahat sarkaar ko pehali dfa kisi sandigdh ke cellphone kii vibhinn networko par, vah bhi desh bhar main nigaraanee karne kii ijaajat mil jaaegi
 An intelligence officer calls it the "nuclear weapon" of phone tapping software
 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar mandetary audit trail file ko jari rakhane kii yojana bana rahi he, jisamen tap kiye jane vaale numberon ke electronic footprint bhi honge-agency ko kab tak ke liye tanping kii ijaajat he, baatcheet record hui kya? or uski pratiyaan bhi baniin kya? vagairah
 The same protocol is applicable worldwide
 phone tap ko sakshya ke taur par manyata dene vaale mulkon kii adaalaton main audit file pesh kiya janaa jaruri hota he
 According to an intelligence officer associated with this project, "no copy of tap can be made unofficially in India under the protocol
" puraa tantra paardarshee he
 The audit file can only be accessed through a special password, which will be with the central agencies
 tap kii hui tamaam soochnaaon ke vishleshan-milan kii koshishon ke tahat grih mantralay ne rajyon se ve saare record maange hai, jo unhone phone or internet par pakade hai
 It also plans to monitor the functioning of important committees set up for electronic surveillance in all states
 aisi kendriya samiti ke mukhiya cabinet sachiv hai or kanoon tathaa doorsanchaar sachiv iske sadsy hai
 This monitoring committee is a mere formality, with most applications getting approval from the Home Secretary

 Nevertheless, the logic of political intelligence and its misuse for personal gain cannot be dismissed

 At the same time, the Congress is expected to get the lowest 106 seats in history and with allies it can reach the figure of 129 seats
 is janamat surveykshan kii khaas baat yah he ki isamen do lakh logon kii raay poochi gai he
 It predicts the number of seats, not the range of seats
 agar is surveykshan kii bhavishyavaanee sach sabit hoti he, to yah bijepi kaa ab tak kaa sabase behtareen pradarshan hoga
 The NDA can emerge as the largest pre-poll alliance by getting 229 seats
 parampara ke anusaar raashtrapati sabase bade dal yaa sabase bade chunaav purv gathbandhan ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit karte rahe hai
 In such a situation, the NDA may be preferred, but in this survey, the possibility of the NDA remaining 43 seats away from the majority data is given
 aise main sarkaar ke sthayitv ko lekar raashtrapati prashn puch sakate hai
 This survey has another interesting conclusion
 endie or upie main sau siton kaa faasla
 Similarly, there is a difference of about 90 seats in BJP and Congress
 yah antar isliye mahatvapurn he, kyonki congress ko sau ke aasapaas siten milane kaa matlab hoga congress ke baahar se samarthan ke jariye tisare morche yaa vaikalpik morche kii sarkaar kii sambhaavna kaa samaapt hona
 The question arises that if the survey proves to be correct, then how will the NDA arrange the 40 seats required to form the government? BJP strategists would like to take such parties as potential allies who can join the government and give them stability if they stay away from the NDA majority
 pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bijepi jayalalita kii ediemke or mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress se samarthan lene ke liye bahut icchhuk nahin hogi, kyonki in donon hi netaaon ne atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ke liye kai mushkilen khadi kii thim
 However Narendra Modi's friendship with Jayalalithaa
 shuruyaat main tisare morche ke saath khadey hone baad jayalalita ne apni ore se sambandh todakar bijepi ko chunaav ke baad ke sambhavit gathbandhan ke liye sanket diya he
 While the ice has melted between Mamata Banerjee and Jayalalithaa and the conversation has started
 mamata banerjee ko pashchim bengal main vidhansabha chunaav main janaa he
 He should hardly join the government keeping Muslim voters in mind
 haa, sarkaar ko baahar se ranneetik samarthan dekar rajya ke liye 'moti keemat' jarur vasuul sakati hai
 This will be a big factor for potential partners
 rajyon main sarkaar chalaa rahe kshetreey dal centre kii sarkaar se dostana ravaiya rakhana chaahate hai
 They need the help of the Center for the development of their state

 Obviously these things have been written on the basis that the prediction made in the opinion poll should be true
 16 may ko kya tasviir banati he sara daaromadar isi par rahegaa
 But even if we consider the assessment of the opinion poll as a sign of wind, then it would not be wrong to guess that the wind is blowing in favor of NDA

 ) Before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the exercise of forming a grand alliance against the BJP in Jammu and Kashmir started
 lekin amali jama pahanaae jane se pehle rajyapal ne vidhansabha bhang karne kii sifarish kar in koshishon kii hawa nikaal di
 Let us tell you that Governor's rule was imposed in Jammu and Kashmir since the alliance between BJP and PDP was broken
 congress, neshnal kaanffence or pidipi vidhansabha bhang karne kii maang lagaataar uthaa rahi thim, lekin chunaav ke liye taiyaar nahin thi
 While the BJP was in the process of forming a Third Front government led by People's Conference President Sajjad Ghani Lone, he needed 18 other mlas to get a majority figure
 aise main vipaksh kii party main tut ke bina mumkin nahin tha
 What BJP lost: In the politics of Jammu and Kashmir, BJP was successful in winning 25 mlas in 2015 for the first time
 pidipi ke baad duusari sabase badi party thi
 In such a situation, the BJP-PDP coalition government was formed
 lekin donon ke bich 40 maheene hi sarkaar chal saki
 There was no better coordination between the two parties even while in government
 vahiin, bijepi 25 siten jeetne ke baad bhi paanch saal rajya kii satta main nahin rah saki
 Many party mlas won elections for the first time, but they could not complete their 6-year term as mlas
 bijepi ko kya phaaydabijepi kii tisare morche kii sarkaar banane kii koshish ke bich ek-duusare ke kattar virdohi neshnal conference or pidipi va congress milakar sarkaar banane kii kavayad main jute gaye the
 But before his government was formed, the Governor dissolved the assembly
 is tarah se vipaksh milakar bhi sarkaar nahin bana sakaa
 If that were the case, this alliance could have become a major force in the 2019 general election as well
 pidipi ko kya nuksaan-kya phaaydajammu-kashmir main pidipi 28 siton ke saath sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi, lekin bahumat ke aankade se dur hone ke chalate use bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banani padi
 But it had to withdraw from the coalition after 40 months of trouble
 satta se baahar hone ke baad 6 vidhayak or ek saansad ne party se baghawat kii
 The PDP was trying to form a government with the National Conference and the Congress to avoid any breakdown and return to power, but the Governor turned the tide on
 haalanki, pidipi khud ko tut se bachaane main safal hui
 What the National Conference lost - what the Pioneer Conference had 15 mlas
 party pramukh umr abdulla lagaataar vidhansabha bhang karne kii sifarish kar rahe the, lekin chunaav ke liye raji nahin the
 If the Third Front government came into existence, the National Conference mlas could also be broken
 aise main vidhansabha bhang hone se vidhayakon kii tut se party batch gai, lekin party ko yah nuksaan hua ki mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar nahin ban saki
 What damage did the Congress make? In Jammu and Kashmir, the Congress had 12 mlas
 congress sarkaar banane kii sthiti main nahin thi
 However, the danger of breakdown of mlas remained constant on the party
 vidhansabha bhang hone se congress ko yah nuksaan hua ki 2019 ke chunaav se pehle rajya main mahagathbandhan vajood main nahin aa sakaa
 However, like the PDP, the Congress saved its mlas from breaking

 Aaj Tak's SIT team has made such a terrifying disclosure of the nexus between police and criminals, knowing that you will be stunned
 aapke liye aapke saath sadaiv
 Delhi Police's promise as well as claim
 vardi vaale kasame khate hai aapaki or hamaari hifaazat kii
 To always follow along
 par kuch police waalon ne in kasmon ke myne badal die hai
 They promise to follow along with the murderers, the guilty
 paise se miltaa he katl kaa license!chaunkiye mat
 Because, if someone wants to kill, then all he has to do is to heat a handful of Delhi Police's few spies and in return he will get a license to kill
 ji haa katl kaa license
 This dreadful face of some Delhi Police scapegoats came to light when last year in Ghazibad, a mafia gang roasted two innocent people with bullets
 bich sadak par, bhari dupahari main
 a case was registered, there were also sections of murder against the accused
 par ghaziabad police kii mushkil ye thi ki aakhir poochtacha karen to kisase
 Because all ten accused shown on the spot were imprisoned in different police stations in Delhi and Faridabad
 din dahaade hawalat se chhot kar hatya, or phir waapas hawalat mensawaal yahi ki ek hi shaks ek hi vakt do alag alag jagahon par kaise maujuud ho saktaa he
 Yes, who is already locked in the police stations of Delhi and Faridabad, how can he execute such a sensational murder case by reaching the spot in Ghaziabad
 kahin aisa to nahin ki dilli main chand vardeevaale in kaatilon se mili the or is dohare katl ko anjaam dene ke liye hawalat se mauka-e-vaardaat par jane kii chhot de di
 Till now you must have seen such a story only in films
 par kya ye haqikat main bhi mumkin he
 Should some day get rid of the hawk and kill it and then come back into the lockup
 jaanch kii kadiyaan jab sulajhani shuru hui to dilli police ke kai daagi chehre benaqaab hote gaye
 One by one the handiwork of ten uniforms came out
 jaan lijiye in daagiyon ke naam kyonki inaki kaali karatuut kisi ko bhi sharmasaar kar dengi
 Named Delhi Police: ASI Dinesh, Head Constable Govind, Constable Samarjeet, Constable Shiv Kumar, Constable Hariprakashhariyana Police: SI Kanhaiya Lal, Head Constable Naurang, Constable Naveen, Constable Dayanand and Head Constable Mohar Singh are as good as they are! Even embarrassing

 May 5 is World Environment Day and just before that the Center for Science and Environment has released a survey
 is survey main paaya gaya he ki desh kii steel companiyaan baari maatra main pradooshan failaa rahi hai
 This includes heavy air and water pollution in addition to solid waste
 desh ke 21 steel companiyon par kiye gaye survey main siesai ne paaya ki yah sabhi companiyaan jis bade paimaane par zamin, pani, bijli or kachche maal kaa istemaal karti hai uske hisaab se unka utpaadan nahin kar rahi hai
 For example, all steel plants in the country have 75 thousand hectares of land while their production is just 75 million tons
 jabaki antarrashtriya maanak ke hisaab se 10 lakh yaa kahen ek million ton steel utpaadan ke liye mahaz 200 hectare zamin kii zarurat hoti he
 According to CSE, only 21 companies supported the survey in 21 while none other than the Rourkela plant of state-run SAIL was ready for this survey
 pradooshan failaane vaali companiyon main sarkari company cell sabase upar he
 According to CSE, only Rourkela plants of SAIL participated in this survey, while Bhilai, Durgapur, Bokaro and Burnpur plants did not provide any information for their survey
 phir bhi siesai ne apane tareeqe se jo aankade jutaaye unke aadhaar par yah paaya gaya ki cell ke plants paryaavaran ko sabase zyada nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai
 The comments hairat kii baat he cell ko in plants ko paryaavaran sangrakshan ke maanak par mahaz 2 se 9 ank tak mili hai
 CSE Director General Sunita Narayan says that SAIL has a lot of facilities with which it could manage well
 sarkaar ko sochna hoga ki akhir ye maharatna company paryaavaran kii khaatir kuch kyon nahin kar rahi
 In the survey, the steel industry of Raigad in Maharashtra has been considered the best but it has achieved only 40 percent number
 siesai kaa daawa he ki nattejey tak pahunchane main do saal lage or har plant ke khadaan se lekar invaranmental management tak qareeb 150 paimaanon par jaanch kii gai
 Regarding the reliability of its survey and its results, Sunita Narayan says that the information and data from the companies in the survey was combined with data from the Pollution Control Board
 iske alaava mauqe par ja kar bhi jaanch kii gai or aasapaas kii aabaadi se bhi baat kii gai
 Before releasing the result, it was also sent to the respective plants
 ekaadh plants ne apni baat rakhane kii koshish kii jabaki kuch ne ise maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Now through these results, CSE will try to pressurize the government to enact stringent laws for steel plants so that the damage to the environment can be minimized
 siesai kii maane to 21 main 13 companiyon ne hi survey main sahyog kiya jabaki sarkari company cell ke rourkela plant ke alaava koi or plant is survey ke liye taiyaar hi nahin hua
 Government company SAIL tops the polluting companies
 siesai ke mutabik cell ke sirf rourkela plant ne hi is survey main hissaa liya jabaki bhilai, durgapur, bokaro or burnpur plants ne survey ke liye apni taraf se koi jaankaree nahin di
 Nevertheless, based on the data collected by CSE in its own way, it was found that sail's plants are causing the most damage to the environment
 tippaniyan Surprisingly, SAIL has got only 2 to 9 marks on the standard of environmental protection to these plants
 siesai kii mahanideshak sunita narayan kaa kahana he ki cell ke paas bahut suvidhaayen hai jinase vah acha bandobast kar sakate the
 The government will have to think why this Maharatna company is not doing anything for the sake of the environment
 survey main maharashtra ke raigarh kii ispaat industry ko sabase acha mana gaya he lekin yah bhi 40 fisadi number hi hasil kar paayi
 The CSE claims that it took two years to reach the results and that every plant from the mine to the environmental management was tested at around 150 scales
 apane survey or uske nattejey kii vishwasaneeyata ke bare main sunita narayan kahati hai ki survey main companiyon se mili jaankaree or aankadon ko pradooshan control board se mili aankadon ke saath mila kar dekha gaya
 Apart from this, he was also examined on occasion and he also spoke to the surrounding population
 nateeja jari karne ke pehle ise sambandhit plants ko bhi bheja gaya
 Some plants tried to maintain their point while some refused to accept it
 ab in nateezon ke zarie siesai sarkaar par yah dabaav banane kii koshish karegi ki vah steel plants ke liye kade qaayade kanoon banaae taaki paryaavaran ko hone vaale nuksaan ko kam kiya ja sake

 Ankit Kumar, 31, had come to his tutoring center in the morning to teach the children when the unidentified assailant shot him
 mana ja rahaa he ki ankit ko goli maarane vaala pehle se hi tution centre par chipa hua tha
 It is worth mentioning that a similar massacre took place in Khyala area of the capital Delhi exactly 10 months ago, in which a young man named Ankit, who was in love with a Muslim girl, was murdered publicly with a sharp weapon
 taaja maamla dilli ke jahangirpuri kaa he
 Where the resident Ankit used to run his coaching center just a short distance from the house
 vah schuli bacchon ko koching padhaata tha
 People around the place heard the sound of firing and immediately reached the spot
 jab ve vahaan pahunche to dekha ankit jameen par gire hue the
 People felt that Ankit has been electrocuted
 karant ke dar se vahaan maujuud mahilaon ne chune kii bajaae pehle danda laane kaa faisla kiya
 However, later on, Ankit's body was bleeding
 iske baad logon ne police ko soochna di
 Mahendra Park Police Station, who arrived on the spot, has not yet received any clue
 saath hi aisa koicisitivifootage mila he, jisamen hatyare saaf najar aa rahe hon

 In the morning two boys were already present on the occasion
 maamle main mritak ke parivaar waalon kaa ye bhi aarope he ki police is ghatana ke paune ghante ke baad maukey par pahunchi or itani der ankit kii laash ghatnasthal par hi padi rahi
 a similar massacre took place in February, in the late evening of February 2, 2018, in the Delhi's Khyala area, was stirred by the murder of a young man with a knife
 bheedbhad vaale bazaar ke bichobich chaar logon ne gherkar ek yuvak kii chaakuon se godakar hatya kar di thi
 Later, the affair turned out to be a love affair
 darasal, mritak yuvak kaa naam ankit tha
 He was about 23 years old
 uskaa ek muslim ladki ke saath prem prasang tha
 The girl's parents were very upset about this
 ab is vaardaat ke baad ladki bhi apane gharavaalon se apni jaan ko khatra bataa rahi he
 Ankit and the girl, who lived in RG flat in Raghuveer Nagar, were in love with each other
 jiske chalate ankit kii guuruuvaar ko hatya kar di gai
 The girl's family members were accused of murder

 On the eve of the Lokpal draft joint committee meeting, senior ministers discussed the government's strategy for about three hours
 vitt mantri or samiti ke adhyaksh pranav mukherjee kii adhyakshata main hui baithak main kendriya mantri kapil sibbal, salmaan khurshid tathaa virappa moili shaamil the, jo masauda samiti main bhi shaamil hai
 Minister of State in Prime Minister's Office V
 narayansami ne bhi baatcheet main hissaa liya
 However the committee member and Home Minister P
 chidambaram dilli se baahar hone ke chalate baithak main nahin shaamil hue
 After the meeting which lasted for two hours and 45 minutes, no minister gave any information to the media about it
 samiti kii aaj hone vaali baithak main yadi baatcheet puri nahin hui to mangalvaar ko bhi ek daur kii baatcheet ho sakati he
 On behalf of the Hazare side, Karnataka Lokayukta Santosh Hegde dismissed speculation of secession in Anna Hazare's side and said he would attend the meeting
 hegade ne 16 agast se anna hajaare kii anshan par jane kii yojana par pehle virodh jataane ke baad is par samarthan jataayaa
 After the differences in the Lokpal Drafting Committee meeting held last Wednesday, the government decided that a draft document would be prepared by June 30, in case the deadlock persists, referring to the points of agreement and disagreement on both sides
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal ne kal ek baar phir spasht kar diya ki sarkaar pradhanmantri pad ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke khilaaf he, lekin unke pad chhodane ke baad unhen abhiyojan ke daayre main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Hegde, however, believes that keeping the Prime Minister out of the Lokpal's purview until he holds office will not serve the purpose of an effective inquiry
 is bich, shanivaar ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii party ke anya sheersh netaaon ke saath ahm baithak hui
 In this, a general opinion was formed about convening an all-party meeting soon to know the views of all political parties on the issue of Lokpal
 sibbal ne bhi kaha ki sarkaar masauda vidheyak cabinet ko bhejne se pehle raajnneetik dalon se charchaa karegi
 On the other hand, the Hazare side is also preparing to communicate with political parties
 is bare main masauda samiti ke sadsy or artiai kaaryakarta arvind kejariwal ne bataaya, ‘ham 20 or 21 june ko hone vaali baithak ke baad raajnneetik dalon se samvaad karenge taaki unhen apni daleelon ke bare main avgat kara saken
 Asked about the claims of the committee's convener, Law Minister Veerappa Moily, to agree on several issues between the two sides, Kejriwal said that 15 per cent of the issues in the committee's meetings so far have not been discussed
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar pradhanmantri, ucch nyaaypalika or sansad ke andar saansadon ke aacharan ko lokapal kii jaanch ke daayre main laane ke khilaaf he
 On Saturday evening, the Hazare side issued a statement questioning the government's pleas to bring the joint secretary and above-ranked bureaucrats under the scrutiny of the proposed Lokpal
 is bich, donon pakshon kii ore se bayaanbaji kaa daur jari he
 An all-party meeting is expected to be convened in the first week of next month to know the views of all political parties on the issue of bringing the Prime Minister under the ambit of Lokpal Bill

 samvidhan peeth ne kaha tha ki jamini vivaad se iskaa lenaa dena nahin isliye civil maamle kii sunwaayee hogi
 Justice Nazir, however, disagreed, saying that the decision of the Constitution Bench should be reconsidered

 bharat ko england ke khilaaf 21 july se lords main hone vaale test match main behad satark rahane kii jarurat he
 This will be the 2000th Test match and if we consider the figures so far, the hosts have been dominating the 100, 200, 1000 i
e
 almost every hundredth Test match
 bharat abhi duniya kii number ek test team he, lekin england ne bhi lambii avadhi ke praaroop main pichley do saal main shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 It will not be easy for India to face its fast bowlers on the fast and swinging pitches there
 iske alaava 2000waan test hone ke kaaran aankade bhi bharat ke khilaaf hi hai
 So far, if the results of every hundredth Test match of first, 100th, 200th and so forth are considered, then the hosts have been successful in winning most matches
 isamen pehla test match bhi shaamil kiya jaataa he, to ab tak aise 20 match main se 14 kaa parinaam niklaa he, jinamein se 10 match main mejabaan team vijayi rahi he
 If India wants to break this myth, it will have to perform like Australia or West Indies
 australia ne ek jabaki westeindies ne teen avasaron par videshi sarajameen par is tarah ke test maichon main jeet darj kii
 The good news for India is that the losing team on these four occasions was England
 melbern main khelaa gaya pehla test match mejabaan australia ne 45 ran se jeeta tha
 The 100th Test match was then played in Sydney, again winning Australia
 england ne 1948 main 300wein test match kii mejabani kii thi, lekin tab mehmaan australia jeet gaya tha
 The fifth match of the series, played between India and Pakistan in Karachi in 1955, was the 400th Test
 yah match anirnit samaapt hua tha
 Apart from this, the result of Test number 1200, played in 1992 between India and South Africa in Durban, also could not be achieved
 australia ne 600wein or 800wein test match main bhi apane chir pratidwandvi england ko apni sarajameen par maat di thi
 In addition to defeating England on its soil in such matches, the West Indies also won the 900th Test match played on the Caribbean soil (bridgetown) in 1981
 pakistan or newjiland ke bich hyderabad main 1984 main khelaa gaya match 1000waan test tha
 In this, the hosts Pakistan had won by seven wickets
 in donon tiimon ke bich hi lahore main 2002 main 1600waan test match khelaa gaya tha, jisamen pakistan ne pari or 324 ran se badi jeet darj kii thi
 England suffered most defeats in such matches, but in the 1700th match played at Lord's in 2004, he was able to break the myth associated with every 100th Test for the first time

 desh kii pramukh suraksha sanstha neshnal technical research orgenigeshan (antiaro) ke ek karmchaaree ne apane monitering system par kuch ajeeb se 'signal’ dekhe
 He saw these signals as the beginning of a big cyber attack
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ke adheen kaam karne vaali is agency ne turant ucchadhikariyon ko chetavanee bheji
 But this warning was ignored, without any explanation, and this mistake resulted in the biggest cyber attack ever against India
 kai ucchstareey adhikariyon ne 12 july, 2012 ko bataaya ki unke email hack kar liye gaye hai
 These included officials from the Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs, Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) and indo-tibetan Border Police (ITBP, a paramilitary force stationed on the 3,500-km-long border with China)
 haikaron ne neshnal informatics centre ke mukhya email sarwar main send lagaai
 Investigation revealed that around 12,000 email accounts were hacked
 is atake kii gambhirtha se lagata he ki haikar ahm suchanaaen churaana chaahate the
 His special focus was on security information
 apana naam jaahir na karne kii shart par antiaro ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, ''panchayat raaj, mahila evam bal vikaas or sankhyikee jaise mantralayon ko chuaa tak nahin gaya
 The focus of the hackers was on the secrets
 unhone tukdiiyon kii tainaati ke sthanon or itibipi (cmanderon) or grih mantralay ke adhikariyon ke bich samvaad jaisi gupt suchanaaen churaayi
 "officials say that any country may be behind the secret information of the Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs and DRDO, but only one country may be interested in ITBP — China, with which India has a long-standing border dispute 
 sibar security ke jaankaar maanate hai ki bharat par hone vaale adhikansh sibar atake china sthit grups kii ore se hote hai
 India alone is not on the radar of these hackers
 america bhi china ke grups kii hekking ke maamalon kii jaanch kar rahaa he
 An example of this is the hacking of Lockheed Martin's future F-35 fighter aircraft program for future preparation
 mana ja rahaa he ki havers ne iskaa dizin churaayaa, jisase china ko je-20 or je-31 ladaaku vimaan program main madad mili
 China flatly denies these allegations
 nai dilli sthit chini duutavas ke pravaktaa ne email se bataaya ki china haikar atex kaa virodh karata he or in par pratibandh ke liye usne kanoon bhi banaaya he
 He wrote, "china is also one of the victims of hacker attacks
 
 
 china sibar security ke liye antarrashtriya samudaay ke saath sahyog karne ke liye taiyaar he
 “can India prevent cyber attacks on its vital infrastructure, such as transport and communication networks, oil refineries and nuclear power plants? Is the government taking this threat seriously? In December, Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth said at a conference of key information security officers of important ministries, "the government is fully conscious of the threats to our cyberspace
" ” magar sibar security ke jaankaar nijee baatcheet main ise khokhla daawa maanate hai
 He referred to the large-scale email hacking incident using 'zero Day' technique last year
 zero de technic se hone vaale atex ko roka nahin ja saktaa
 Investigators say the situation worsened due to lack of updated security software in most computers
 haal tak desh ko sibar hamalon se surakshit rakhane kii jimmedaari indian computer imargency respance team (siiarti-in) par thi, jise 2004 main information technology vibhaag ke tahat banaaya gaya tha
 Since then, the number of incidents related to cyber security, which could not be known, increased from 23 to 13,301 in 2011
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki in hamalon kii asal sankhya 10 guna zyada ho sakati he, kyonki inke zyaadaatar shikaar yaa to ise jaan hi nahin pate yaa yah nahin maanate ki unka system hack kiya gaya
 In July last year, the government split cert-in's responsibilities so that serious threats are not lost in a multitude of minor issues
 siiarti-in ab un sibar asets kii suraksha karata he, jo ati-mahatvapurn nahin hai, jabaki neshnal critical information infrastracchar protection centre (ensiiipisi) naam se ek nai unit bani he jo urja, parivahan, banking, doorsanchaar, raksha or antariksh jaise samvedansheel kshetron ke sibar esets kii suraksha karti he
 Despite increasing threats, India spends very little on cyber security
 sibar security ke liye 2012-13 kaa bajet aavanton (siiarti-in ko milakar) 42

 Shera is derived from the Hindi word lion, which is called Lion in English, but it seems that the English officials of the Commonwealth Games are weak in Hindi and hence they have translated the lion into English which is known as tiger in Hindi
 rashtramandal khelon kii aadhikarik website main shera ke bare main angreji main kuch is tarah se likhaa gaya he, ‘shera, da muscat of 19 kamanwealth games 2010 dely

 ’hindi main iskaa tajaruma is tarah se hoga, ‘shera 19wein rashtramandal khel 2010 dilli kaa shubhankar he
 His name is derived from the Hindi word lion which means tiger (tiger)
 ’ ab jab bechaara sher shuru main hi tiger ban gaya he to aage bhi galtiyaan kar di gayi he
 Further Indian mythology is mentioned in which it is written that the tiger, the tiger, is associated with the goddess Durga who is a symbol of 'shakti (or female power) and the destroyer of evils
 rankshetra main vah apane vaahan (baagh) main sawari karti hai
 The organizers of the Commonwealth Games are probably unaware that Devi Durga's vehicle is a lion and hence she is also called Singhwahini

 (input bhashaa se) The liquor businessman Vijay Mallya, who has been absconding from the country in the Kingfisher loan case, has once again broken his silence and presented his clarification
 maalya ne yah safai pesh karte hue daawa kiya he ki puure maamle main vah begunaah hai
 Despite this, the country's leaders and the media have declared him an absconding businessman by taking loans
 maalya ne daawa kiya he ki media dwaara chalaae gaye trial ke baad kuch bainkon ne bhi unhen vilphul difolter ghoshit karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Significantly, Mallya claimed that the current cleaning is based on a letter he wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on 15 April 2016 and his statement contained excerpts from the letter written to both
 apni safai main maalya ne kaha ki lambii khamoshi ke baad ab unke upar lage aaropon par paksh rakhane kaa samay aa gaya he
 Mallya claimed that the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate made false allegations against him on the government's order and filed a charge sheet
 vahiin idi ne unke or unke parivaar kii 13,900 karod rupee kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya he
 Along with this, banks have presented him to the country by making them posters of fraud
 apni safai main maalya ne silsilewar dhang se unpar lage ek-ek aaropon par apana paksh rakhaa he
 How much debt of banks? Mallya said that a consortium of 17 banks led by State Bank of India gave a loan of about Rs 5,500 crore to Kingfisher Airlines
 is lone ko dene ke liye bank ke prayek str par niyam ke mutabik unhen manjuuri di gai
 After this, a recovery of Rs 600 crore has been made by selling the property pledged for the loan
 iske alaava 2013 se 1,280 karod rupee karnataka hoicourt main security diposit main pade hai
 Therefore, a total recovery of Rs 1,880 crore has been done
 maalya ne daawa kiya ki 2010 ke dauraan jab desh main aviation sector susti ke daur main tha tab rigerv bank kii manjuuri se kingfisher ko die gaye karj ko ristractochar karne kaa kadam uthaaya gaya
 Subsequently, the State Bank of India wrote to the RBI in January 2012 that Mallya had invested a substantial amount in Kingfisher Airlines, but it was not possible to prevent the airlines from going into losses due to the current sluggishness
 ise padhein: nae kanoon ke tahat bhagoda ghoshit hoga vijay maalya, jabt hogi sampattiiske baad jab kingfisher airlines ghate main chali gai tab karj dene vaale bainkon ke sangh ne karj kii recovery ke liye tribunel kaa darwaja khatkhataate hue 5000 karod rupee ke karj or 1200 karod rupee ke byaaj kii recovery kii maang kii
 Therefore, a total recovery of Rs 6,200 crore was said by the banks but the report of the liability was circulated with exaggeration in the media
 vilphul difolt kaa aarope?maalya ne daawa kiya ki bainkon dwaara tribunel jane ke baad supreme court ke jariye setelment ke do prastaav die
 The proposals were made on 29 March 2016 and 6 April 2016
 in prastaavon main bank ke 5,000 karod rupee ke karj ke aivaj main 4,000 karod rupee or 2,000 karod rupee ek anya lambit maamle main clem bharne kii peshkash kii
 The proposal was tabled next month with an amendment of Rs 4,400 crore and Rs 2,000 crore
 lekin jahaan pehle prastaav ko bank ke sheersh str par thukraa diya gaya vahiin duusare prastaav ko bank ke ek chote karmchaaree ne supreme court main hi thukraa diya
 Vijay Mallya claimed that after rejecting these proposals, he wrote letters to the SBI chief on 10 May 2016, 2 June 2016 and 10 June 2016 to discuss the agreement
 lihaaja maalya kaa daawa he ki aisi sthiti main bainkon dwaara unhen vilphul difolter ghoshit karnaa uchit nahin he kyonki unhone lagaataar bainkon ke karj ko nipataane kii pahal kii he
