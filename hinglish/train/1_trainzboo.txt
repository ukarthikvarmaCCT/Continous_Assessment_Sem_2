 ) Every planet has only one vision, which is only the seventh vision
 parantu brihaspati, mangal or shani ke paas anya drushtiyaan bhi hoti hai
 Of all the planets, Saturn has the strongest vision
 iske paas saatvin ke alaava teesri or dasvin drushti bhi hoti he
 The planet, sentiment or person this vision falls on, is destroyed
 shani kii drushti alag alag grahon par padakar alag alag dushprinaam paidaa karti he
 What effect does the sight of Saturn have on different planets? - If there is a sight on the Sun, then a married life of a person is bad
 pita putr main sambandh achche nahin hote hai
 - If the moon is on, intense quietness is produced
 jiske kaaran yaa to vyakti sanyasi hota he yaa maansik rogi ho jaataa he
 - If there is an explosion like situation on Mars, there are chances of severe accident
 - budh par drushti ho to vyakti dhoort, chaalaak hota he, twachaa kii samasya ho jaati he
 Due to the sight on Jupiter, a person is not only a patient of the stomach, but also becomes knowledgeable and egoistic
 - shukr par drushti ho to charitra dosha hota he, vyakti nimna karm main lipt rahata he
 - If you look at Rahu or Ketu, then the person becomes a victim of intoxication, sometimes even success in politics is achieved
 nirjala ekadshi par karen ye upaay, puri hogi har manokamanashani kii drushti kab laabhakaari hoti he ?- jab shani apni raashi yaa ucch raashi ko dekhtaa he
 - When Saturn comes in Aries, Cancer or Leo
 - jab shani par brihaspati kii drushti hoti he
 - When Saturn is in Aquarius sign
 - jab shani kii drushti laabhakaari ho to vyakti ko dhan or prashasan kaa vardaan miltaa he
 Also the person succeeds by going away from home
 jaane, kab he batuka bhairav jayanti, kya he puja vidhiagar shani kii drushti kaa prabhaav ashubh ho to kya upaay karen ?- kabhi bhi shani ke kisi aisi murti ke darshan na karen , jisame shani kii ankhen hoti hai
 - Wearing red clothes every Saturday, standing in front of Hanuman ji and recite Hanuman Chalisa
 - roj siankal pashchim disha kii ore deepak jalaakar shani dev ke mantra kaa jaap karen
 - Be nice to the little ones and helpers of the house
 - nile rang kaa adhik se adhik prayog karen

" ’’tendulkar ko sabane di badhibihar or maharashtra ke mukhyamantriyon kramash: nitish kumaar or ashok chavaan, kendriya mantriyon salmaan khurshid, shashi tharur or argedy pramukh lalu prasad ne kaha ki vah sab tendulkar ko badhai dete hai, jo ek maharashtrin hai or bharat ke gaurav hai

 But there are also some stars who have been active in the industry for a long time and their stardom has also remained for a long time

 Recently, Aamir Khan said during an interview that his stardom will not remain so in the coming years

 When Salman was asked the same question during the promotion of his upcoming film Bharat, his answer was very interesting
 salmaan se poocha gaya ki kya ve us samay ke liye taiyaar hai jab unki filmein acha bijness karnaa band kar dengi
 In response, Salman said that he is confident that he can still maintain his stardom for at least 30 to 35 years

 This is going to happen to us as well

 kya ‘munni badnaam hui’ or ‘shila kii javaani’ sareekhe superhit item geet ‘masala’ kheme ke samakaleen hindi filmkaaron ke haath lage kisi dhansu formule kii upaj hai, jisamen vivaad utprerak kii bhoomika nibhaate hai yaa ye nagame apni-apni film kii patakatha kii swaabhaavik lay se vaaki mail khate hai
 The debate over these songs, which have spent a lot of time in the psyche of the media and audiences in the background of different controversies, is not over yet
 hindi filmon ke flashbek main jaaen, to pataa chalata he ki geetkaar apni rachanaaon main juli, maaria, monica, priya or kiran samet alag-alag stri naamon kaa gaahe-bagaahe istemaal karte rahe hai
 But according to experts, then such songs did not create as much chaos as the previous ones were cut on the film item songs with the top lyrics of 'sheela' and 'munni'

 However, Sunidhi Chauhan, who gave her easygoing voice to the song titled 'sheela Ki Jawani', says, "the lyrics of this song are written according to the script of the film and not to hurt the feelings of a woman
" lihaaja is silsile main kisi vivaad ko tool dena uchit nahin he
 The young playback singer recently told the media that after the success of the song 'sheela Ki Jawani' from the film Tees Maar Khan, she now goes on stage for a performance, fans call her 'sheela' and They do not mind that
 is bich, mashhoor shaayar or geetkaar raahat indori ‘munni badnaam hui’ or ‘shila kii javaani’ jaise geeton ke maujuuda chalan ko bazaar se jodate hai
 He said in his unconcerned style, "see, today the market has dominated in every sector
 jahaan bazaar aa jaataa he, vahaan stariyata ko talash nahin kiya jaataa
 The more controversy will be raised about the film songs, the more the people associated with the film will benefit
 ’’chunauteepurn kirdaaron kii adaayagi ke liye prasiddh shabana azmi kaa is maamle main andaaj-e-bayaan kuch or he
 When asked about the success of songs like 'munni Badnaam Hui' and 'sheela Ki Jawani', the film actress said at the Indore Press Club, "in a democratic system, we have no right to decide what people do Want to see or hear or what kind of books they want to read
 ’’ bakaul shabana film ‘dabang’ kii kamyaabi ne filmkaaron ko yah baat phir samajha di ki desh main darshakon kaa ek bada varg aisa he, jisaki katai andekhi nahin kii ja sakati
 Film critic Shriram Tamrakar said that songs like 'munni Badnaam Hui' and 'sheela Ki Jawani' are a product of formulaic thinking of filmmaking and were used by filmmakers as marketing tools
 unhone kaha, ‘‘media main bhi donon gaanon ko jarurat se zyada prachaar mila
 The names of women have been used before in the lyrics of film songs, but then there was not much ruckus on them
 ’’ tamrakar ne kaha ki in dinon ek adad item geet ke boote puri film kaa bedaa paar karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 But as soon as a new Shigufa comes out, this formula will die out

 meri pasandida filmon kii list main ye naam kaaphi upar hai or inako banane vaala ek hi naam he gulzaar
 He has touched the strings of millions of hearts with his songs, directions and story
 unheen main se ek main bhi rahaa hum
 When i started film journalism seven years ago, many times i used to think that once i talk to Gulzar, i will enjoy it
 ab main tehra dilli main to aise maukey kam hi aae jab ve yahaan aae hon auramain unase milane ja sakaa hum
 Then the story also remains limited
 lekin unako lekar mere man main chhavi banane kaa kaam kuch patrkaar doston or seniors ne kiya
 Many friends say that they talk very rarely on the phone and many said that they are very moody
 ab unki ek alag hi chhavi mere saamne ban gai thiah prem kii shaayari kehane vaale gulzaar kii sakht mizaaj or mudi image
 Tried many times for his story for his coat, i had his landline number
 lekin unke secretary mahoday ne kabhi un tak pahunchane nahin diya or unka naam lekar kai bahaane bana daale
 His image was further strengthened
 pehla samvadyah baat 2012 kii he
 i was doing a story about the changing form of Hindi
 bhashaa ke mizaaj ke maharathi gulzaar kaa kot lenaa mujhe sarthak laga
 Just once again i mixed his landline number in Mumbai
 ittefaq kahuun yaa apana gudlak phone par baari aawaaj ai jise kai baar televijan or shaayari main sun chukaa tha
 i told them the reason for my introductions and phone
 maine poocha ki filmon kii bhashaa badal rahi he or english zyada aa rahi he
 What do you think? His correct answer was, 'cinema is a mirror of society
 'unki ek line meri puri story ko railevent banane ke liye kaaphi thi
 i used his statement many times
 unke saath baatcheet jaadui ehsaas thi
 The second dialogue is from last year
 unhen dada sahib phalke puraskaar mila
 In the last minutes, i wanted to interview Gulzar
 man main shankaa thi, nahin hua to? samay kam tha, landline par zyada bharosa nahin kar saktaa tha
 Hence, he asked for his number from a Mumbai-based film journalist friend
 unhone yah kehete hue mobile diya, 'maine kai baar tri kiya he, ve phone uthaate nahin hai
 You try 
 
 ' maine unhen massej kar diya
 After that, i got used to it
 kaam ke chakkar main massej ke bare main bhul hi gaya
 The number was also not saved
 massej ke aadhe ghante baad phone kii ghanti baji
 i was going to ask who? Then his voice was recognized
 meri khushi kaa thikaana nahin rahaa
 i said sir you are calling
 unka bada pyaara-sa jawaab tha,'aap hi ne to massej main kaha tha ki baat kerani he
 
 
 'after that i had a conversation with him for about ten minutes and every answer to him was very accurate and every sentence was finished
 aise jawaab jinamein editing kii koi gunjaaish na ho
 And so changed images
 My two dialogues like Gulzar were enough to break the image made through my friends and seniors
 unase baatcheet kaa nateeja yahi tha ki ve na to sakht mizaaj hai or na hi mudi
 They believe only in talking about work and only respond to work
 unke saath baatcheet se pehle kaaphi mehnat karne kii jarurat he
 Also of homework
 ve filmi duniya ke baaki logon se thode alag hai, vajah shaayad ve samay or shabdon ke myne bakhubi samajhate hai kyonki shaayar apane samay or shabdon donon main hi jeeta he
 In such a situation, it is also important for them to be so
 unhone khud hi kaha he,'jindagi yun hui basar tanha,kafila saath chalaa or safar tanha apane saaye se chowk jate hai, umr gujri he is kadar tanha'

 Born in Dera Sacha Sauda and married there, Gurdas Singh has made the biggest disclosure about Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 ajtak / india today se khaas baatcheet karte hue usne bataaya ki ram rahim ko shuru main ashleel filmein dekhne kaa bahut shauk tha
 Later, his hobby turned into Ayyashi somewhere
 gurdas singh ne khulaasa karte hue bataaya ki 23 sitambar koram rahimane jis vakt deraa sachcha sauda kii gaddi sanbhali thi
 At that time, the then Dera chief Shah Satnam Ji had told Gurmeet Singh that never keep anyone inside the camp

 Never turn the dera into a trust and do not do business activities in the dera, otherwise this dera will be ruined
 gurdas ne bataaya ki sabase pehle prem naam kii ek mahila gurmeet singh ko ladkiyaan supplai kiya karti thi
 After that, to fulfill this desire of Gurmeet, a girls' school connecting with his cave was opened
 baad main hostel kholaa gaya
 The girls of the 11th and 12th classes, who had an eye on Gurmeet, used to tell Gurmeet every information related to those girls named Prem
 phir in ladakiyon ko maafee ke naam par yaa simran karne ke naam par ek vishesh kamare main le jaaya jaataa tha
 The room where the microphone used to be
 gupha main baitha gurmeet yah sari baaten spikar ke jariye sunata rahata tha
 The décor in the room was done in such a way that the room was transformed into a paradise
 us kamare main chaaron taraf multicler kii liting hoti thi

 tab gurmeet singh ek lift ke jariye achaanak kamare main prakat hota tha or ladki ko bolta ki gurmeet to apane gupha main he or wo khud to dev lok se aayaa he
 He then lured the girl and raped her

 gupha ke andar puure parivaar ko bulaayaa gaya
 Later Gurmeet said that he has to explain something to Honeypreet
 sabko baahar bhej diya gaya
 Stopped Honeypreet there itself
 gurdas ke mutabik us samay vah gupha ke get par khadaa tha
 He told his brother that today Baba will do wrong thing with Honeypreet and that is what happened
 haniprit ne yah baat apane dada ko bataai
 Honeypreet's grandfather made a lot of noise at that time
 is par gurmeet ke logon ne na sirf haniprit ke dada kii pitayee kii balki unke sir par bandook lagaakar kaha ki chup raho varanaa maar die jaaoge
 After this, Honeypreet's grandfather told this to Honeypreet
 haniprit ne kaha ki vah dere main nahin rahegi
 And then she left for Fatehabad with Vishwas Gupta
 gurmeet ko jaise hi yah baat pataa chali
 He put his special goons behind Honeypreet
 un gundon ne fatehabad se pehle ek dhabas par rokkar haniprit ke sir par bandook rakhkar usase kaha ki tumhaare puure parivaar ko maar diya jayega
 Walk quietly back to the camp and Honeypreet is back there
 lekin haniprit ne kuch samay baad apane dada ko bataaya ki vah is dere ko barbaad karke hi aakhri saans legi
 According to Gurdas, this is probably what has happened now

 jab puure desh kaa dhyaan khaadya suraksha or bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak par laga hua tha, usee samay 5 sitambar ko ek-duusare se jude do vidheyak chupchaap sansad ke patal par rakhe gaye
 These bills filled with legal nuances and lengthy sentences went out of the common man's head
 magar bhavishya kii baaji kii samaj rakhane vaale logon ke liye yah donon hi vidheyak aitihaasik the
 The Constitution (120th Amendment) Bill, 2013 and the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, 2013 provide for new rules for appointment of judges in upper courts
 5 sitambar ko kendriya kanoon mantri kapil sibbal rajyasabha main kehete hai, ''ek behatar bhavishya ke liye sarvshereshth nyaayadhish paane ke vaaste
 "what he did not say is that in the event of its implementation, the government will get unbridled power over the judiciary
" jane-maane kanoonvid or asahmati jataane vaale ekmaatr saansad ram jethmalani kehete hai, ''donon hi bill bure or samvidhan kii buniyadi sanrachana ko nuksaan pahunchane vaale hai
 After this, there was a flood of condemnation of the judiciary from all sides, some of which were normal, some were full of charge and some were just emotion
 nyaaypalika ne kisi pratikriya vyakt kii? 14 sitambar ko dilli main baar association ke seminar main bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish pi
 Sadashivam, while avoiding public criticism of Parliament, also said a lot, "as the Chief Justice of India i am not going over the content of the Bill or how it was passed
" ”jab baar ke sadasyon ne kanoonee birdari se kisi baatcheet ke bagaiyr afra-tafari main vidheyak laane ke tareeke par sawaal kiya to bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ne ek paroksh chetavanee de daali, ''kanoon ke raaj kii bahut kam ummid rah gai he
 "especially after the 2G case," says political psychologist Ashish Nandy, "call it an outpouring of the political fraternity and anger at an active court
" ”ve yah bhi bataate hai ki mukhya nyaayadhish sadashivam or unke purvavarti altamas kabir ke bich july main upji katutaa se bhi nyaaypalika kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaa
 There have been several conflicts between the Supreme Court and the government recently over judicial appointments or the collegium system
 1975 ke apatkaal jaisi rajnatik or nyaayik rup se mahatvapurn ghatnaon ke maddenjar jab karypalika ne nyaayadhishon ko dhamkaakar samarpan ke liye majaboor kar diya tha, tab colegium pranali dhire-dhire viksit hui
 Its present form derives from an important judgment delivered in 1993 by nine judges of the Supreme Court, in which the Supreme Court's highest five judges, headed by the Chief Justice, select judges for the upper courts
 sarkaar ke paas colegium kii sifarish ek baar lautaane kaa vikalp to he, lekin uske baad vah colegium ke faisle ko maanane ke liye baadhya he
 The Bill targets this system: first by creating a Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC) in place of the collegium, then by allowing the executive to play a role in judicial appointments
 magar usase maujuuda vyavastha ke kuch suraksha upaay kamjor bhi pad sakate hai
 For example, currently Article 124 (2) of the Constitution provides for a process of 'consultation' between the President, Chief Justice and other top judges in the appointment process
 magar ab nyaayadhishon ke saath 'paraamarsh’ ko jeesi kii 'sifarish’ se badal diya jayega
 According to a new Article 124A, Parliament can by law constitute a JAC in addition to appointment of judges, eligibility, conditions of service, functions of judges and methods of selection
 is prakriya se ek or mahatvapurn suraksha kavach bhi hataa liya gaya he
 The current system ensures that any change in the selection process will require an amendment to the constitution
 magar jeesi ke gathan tathaa kaaryon kaa nirdhaaran kanoon arthath sansad ke saamaanya bahumat dwaara kiya jayega
 Jurist n
 aar
 Madhav Menon says, "this means that Parliament can change the formation and function of JAC or even remove members by simple majority
" ”jeesi ke gathan main karypalika kaa palada kaaphi baari hoga
 Apart from the Chief Justice of India, the two senior most judges of the Supreme Court and the Union Law Minister, two 'eminent persons' nominated by a committee consisting of the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha will also join the JAC
 jethmalani sawaal uthaate hai, ''yah maujuuda cameti vyavastha se kis tarah behatar he?”isse bhi adhik chaunkaane vaali baat to yah he ki jeesi ke gathan kaa vistrut vivaran samvidhan kii bajaae sansad ke prastaavit adhinium main hoga
 He says, "after this there will be scope for a change in the structure and purpose of JAC
 ”daanv par bhartiya samvidhan kaa buniyadi dhaancha he: anuchhed 50, jo yah anivaary banaata he ki nyaaypalika ko karypalika se pruthak rakhaa jayega
 "every country has to find a way to meet its constitutional needs keeping in mind its unique problems and specialties," says former solicitor Jal Soli Sorabjee
 ”chunki khud sarkaar hi sabase badi mukademebaaj he, isliye nyaayadhishon kii niyukti par sarkaar kaa koi niyantran nahin hona chahie or sarkaar sahit har vaadi ke saath adaalaton ko maamle ke gun-dosha ke aadhaar par faisla lenaa chahie
 The principle of 'infrastructure' of the Constitution was formulated in 1973 in the case of Kesavananda Bharati v
 State of Kerala
 sansad main jabardast bahes ke baavjood vidheyak kaa bhagya adhar main lataka hua he
 The Constitution Amendment Bill is passed in the Rajya Sabha and is stuck in the Lok Sabha
 doosraa vidheyak ek sansadeey samiti ke paas bhej diya gaya he
 But now everyone's eyes are on the Supreme Court: Will the Bill go through the ordeal of judicial trial? Did the Chief Justice of India, surrounded by judicial whirlpool, remember in history as the person who allowed to strangle judicial autonomy? Or he will be remembered as one who opposes the ambition of the executive

 The question is, where do these sages go after the holy bath? kumbh ke dauraan logon ko sabase zyada naga saadhuon kii duniya aakarshith karti he
 The list of questions about Naga Sadhus is long
 masalan
 
 kya naga sadhu banane ke liye koi training hoti he?kya naga sadhu astr shastr main bhi nipun hote hai?kya he naga saadhuon kii 108 dubkiyon kaa rahasy?shunya degree taapmaana main kaise rah lete hai naga sadhu?kya himalay kii gufaaon main he saadhuon kaa sansarkumbh bhartiya sabhyataa kii aisi vishaal tasviir he
 In which mystery with faith

 So let us show you today the astonishing tableau of the strange world of Naga sadhus
 magar kumbh main ek se badhakar ek baba, or usase bhi badhakar unka rahasyamayi sansar
 Some have become silent Silent Baba and some have become a Golden Baba, laden with gold, some have been standing for years on one leg, Khadeshwar Baba, and no one has straightened their hands for years
 to kisi ne apane sir ko bana liya he jangal
 You will see them, if you think about them, then you will just be surprised
 inase miliye rudraksh kii maalaon or unki sankhya dekhakar ab achambhe main pad gaye honge ki aakhir ye kya bhalaa he
 This is the tilism of Rudraksha Baba
 inase miliye ye sone ke koi vyapaaree nahin balki ek baba he apni maujuudagi se har kubh kii shaan badhaate hai
 There is so much gold on the body, the world knows them by the name of Golden Baba
 prayagraj kii dhanti par baabaaon kaa adbhut sansar sajaa he
 Different types of Baba have reached here
 is kumbh main aadhyatmik ghota lagane ke liye ek se badhakar ek sant mahatma pahunche hue hai
 But there is something very special in that too
 inase miliye, jitna khud kaa vajan, shaayad uske baraabar hi vajah hoga inke sharir par based rudrakshon kii
 You will be surprised to know the number of these Rudrakshas
 ek do hajaar nahin balki kul 11 hajaar rudraksh kii maala ye baba pahante hai
 And whether it is summer or winter, after wearing so many rudrakshas, we wash our fumes
 gale main rudraksh to sabhi pahante hai, kehete hai ki blad pressure main raahat milti he lekin ye baba to sar par jaise rajmukut kii tarah rudraksh mukut dhaaran kiye baithe hai
 At a glance, it seems that Rudraksha has taken the place of clothes on Baba's body
 apane aap main behad anuthe hai ye baba
 There is a flood of such babas on the land of Prayag Raj
 videshon se aae log in baabaaon ke hath ko dekhakar achambhit hai
 This world of Baba is attracting people a lot
 haal ye he ki in adbhut baabaaon kii tasveere lene kii hode lagi he
 TV cameras are on these babas and the world is stunned by the astonishing pictures of such babas

 Kejriwal says that what he said is a reality and whatever the consequences, it is ready to suffer
 kejariwal ne ek baar phir kaha he ki sansad or vidhansabhaon ko aparaadhiyon ne bandhak bana rakhaa he
 Kejriwal has said on Twitter that he is receiving threats of treason and insult to Parliament
 lekin ve darane vaale nahin hai
 Significantly, what Arvind Kejriwal said to mps in a meeting is being called objectionable
 lokapal ke jariye bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim chalaane vaale anna hajaare or unki team ko unke samarthakon ne hatho haath liya tha
 Whatever Anna or his team would say, the supporters would understand the order and get it done
 desh ne ek behad ajeeb or nae kism kaa anubhav paaya is team ke saath
 The atmosphere of the tricolor and the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai made the atmosphere sing
 par ab team anna ke sadsy siyaasi maahaul ko gandi jubaan se garma rahe hai
 Team Anna also forgot that her fight is not against the institution or the post but against the people who spoil it
 arvind kejariwal to ab khuleam sansad ko hi sabase badi samastya bataane lage hai
 Gandhian agitators forgot Gandhiji's word - hate sin and not a sinner - he forgot that members of his team have been accused like mps
 or jaise wo aaropon ko sajeesh bataate hai vaise hi unke nishane par aae saansad bhi apane upar lage aaropon ko sajeesh hi kehete hai
 Weighing objectionable words to the elected representatives of the public will go against Team Anna
 kejariwal se pehle team anna ke andolan ke dauraan unke manch se film abhinayta ompuri ne bhi kuch aisi baat kahi thi or phir dabaav padane par maafee maang lee thi
 When Kejriwal himself was accused of declaring the power of Parliament lower than Anna, he and Anna had called Parliament the highest temple of democracy

 The Telangana Joint Conflict Committee, headed by the Telangana Rashtra Samithi, has organized a 48-hour shutdown in Andhra Pradesh
 isamen tiares ke saath alag telugana kaa samarthan karne vaali tamaam partiyaan shaamil hai
 In view of this bandh in Andhra Pradesh, the government has tightened security
 tiares ke adhyaksh ke chandrashekhar raav ne dhamkee di he ki agar centre ne alag telugana rajya ke maamle par or deree kii to rajya bhar main andolan tej kar diya jayega
 He has also threatened to stop buses and trains across the state
 unhone kaha ki ab alag telugana rajya ko banane se koi nahin roak saktaa kyonki is masale par party line se upar uthakar telugana ke sabhi bade netaa saath hai
 All this happened at a time when an economist in India is present on the chair of the Prime Minister and the power of Uttar Pradesh is with a party which wants to call itself peasant
 yahi nahin is party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh agle loksabhaa chunaav ke baad vampanthi dalon ke samarthan se desh kii satta sanbhaalanaa chaahate hai
 At the same time, this incident happened with Israr Khan, a leftist professor and fighting for the interest of farmers
 23 aktubar ko arthshaastra ke 44 varshiya professor apane saathi professor subodh dhawan ke saath ruhelkhand uniwarsity main kuch baatcheet kar rahe the ki achaanak police ne unhen dhar dabocha
 Handcuffs were tied and dragged the dam like rope to the dreaded criminals
 phir hawalat main raat bhar ek daaroga or teen sipaahiyon ne jamkar uski marammat kii
 Khan, who received his doctorate on 'economics of Elementary Education', stood with those farmers who were demanding that the government at least allow them to reap their standing crops before occupying the land
 professor kii jaanwaron kii tarah karai gai parade kii tasviren internet or fasebuk jaisi soshal cites par badi sankhya main share kii gayi or buddhijivi tabake ne is par tikhi pratikriya jataai
 “I was definitely supporting the farmers, but on October 22, when the administration destroyed the standing crop in Saidpur Chunnilal village and the farmers kept protesting, i was not there
 iske baavjood mujhe uniwarsity campus se jaanwaron kii tarah daboch liya gaya
 Khan, who was released on bail on the evening of 13 November after spending 20 days in the Central Jail in Bareilly, said this with great difficulty
 haalanki ke bareli ke esaspi akaash kulhare is tarah ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hai
 He claims, "there is always a scope for charges against the police in such cases, so Israr Khan was sent to jail only after undergoing medical examination
 ” professor ko rassi se baandh ke ghumaae jane ke sawaal kaa sidhaa jawaab na dete hue kulhare ne kaha ki police ne saamaanya kanoonee prakriya kaa paalan kiya
 He said that after tracking their location on the mobile, the police found out where they were that day
 isi aadhaar par unki giraftaar kii gai
 But the way the police have loaded Israr Khan from lawsuits, the questions that arise on his intention only become stronger
 jaraa dekhie, un par kitni dharaaen lagaai gari he-hatya kii koshish ke liye dhara 307 samet dhara 147, 148,149, 332, 336, 323, 504, 506, 427, 325 or sangathit aparaadhiyon par lagane vaala 7 crimilan amendament act
 Apart from this, he was arrested from the university campus itself
 iske bahut se log gavaah hai or giraftaar ke photograph bhi hai
 But the question is why the police administration suddenly fell behind a professor? Actually, a 29 km long bypass is to be built in Bareilly on NH 24 connecting Delhi to Lucknow
 is bypass ke liye sarkaar 30 se zyada gaanvon kii jameen kaa adhigrahan kar rahi he
 Apart from this, a total of 1 for Ramganga Barrage and many other projects
 5 lakh bigha jameen kii jarurat he
 Khan says that the contract to build a bypass here has been awarded to a former bureaucrat's company

 Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the opposition, which is uniting against the Bharatiya Janata Party, may get a big blow
 vipakshi partiyon main sabase bade netaaon main se ek ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne mahagathbandhan or tisare morche ko lekar bada bayaan diya, unhone kaha ki ye sab 2019 chunaav se pehle vyavhaarik nahin lagata he
 The Shiv Sena has also responded to Sharad Pawar's statement, and opposition parties need to be careful with him
 somvaar ko shivasena ne saamana main likhaa ki virodhiyon ko sharad pavaar se saavdhaan rahanaa hoga, kyonki bijepi sharad pavaar kii jubaani apni bhashaa bulavaa rahi he
 Sharad Pawar wrote in Saamna that the Third Front is impossible, the same thing BJP does
 saamana main likhaa he ki to kya sharad pavaar (guruji) kii jubaani bijepi (modi) kuch kahana chaah rahe hai
 He wrote that it will have to be seen whether leaders like Pawar are in opposition or not
 yani agar netritv unke paas nahin rahegaa to teesraa morcha practical nahin hoga
 The article reads what to do about Congress and Rahul Gandhi, who are stuck in this cycle
 kya rahul gandhi kaa netritv sweekaara he, kya pataa rahul gandhi ko alag rakhkar sharad pavaar bhi soch rahe ho, morcha kaise banegaa
 What the BJP wants to say is calling on its opponents
 darasal, ek tivi channel ko intervyuu dete hue purv kendriya mantri sharad pavaar ne ye bada bayaan diya
 He said that the Third Front is not practical, so it will not be able to execute
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki unke kai saathi chaahate hai ki mahagathbandhan bananaa chahie
 What else Pawar said? In the interview, Pawar said that the situation of today's time is exactly like 1977
 us dauraan indira gandhi ek majboot iraadon vaali netaa thim, apatkaal ke dauraan vahiin piem thim
 But then there was no big party in protest, the people voted against him and the Congress lost
 bataa den ki pichley kuch dinon main 2019 chunaav ko dekhte hue mahagathbandhan or tisare morche kii sugabugahat tej hui he
 There are several leaders who are leading the Third Front, including West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Telangana Chief Minister Chandrashekhar Rao, Kerala Chief Minister Vijayan Pinarai and Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu
 lekin isse itar congress bhi apane netritv main vipaksh ko ekajute karnaa chaahati he or ek mahagathbandhan taiyaar karnaa chaah rahi he
 Although Uttarakhand is famous in the country and the world due to its beautiful frieze, pilgrimage and tourism, the other thing that identifies the Devbhoomi is its tigers (tigers), which are called the ashes of Jim Corbett National Park, millions
 Tourists turn to Corbett to experience the thrill and are desperate to get a glimpse of it
 magar ab jangal ke raja par maut kaa saaya dinondin mandaraata ja rahaa he
 It is true that the tigers that cause tremors in human body are now in danger
 6 maheene main 11 baagh maut ke munh menyun to corbett park or usase sate ilaake baaghon kii taadaad ke hisaab se sukhad ahsaas karaate hai
 That is why tourists come to visit here from abroad, but on an average two tigers are dying here every month in the last six months
 ab tak 11 baagh maut kii neend so chuke hai
 The Corbett administration has also come under question
 lagaataar ho rahi baaghon kii maut ke baad baaghon ke sangrakshan par sawaal khadey hone lage hai
 Crores spent on protecting tigers - Corbett Park in Nainital district is called the capital of tigers
 inaki acchhee taadaad ke chalate yah kshetra mashhoor he
 The government gets crores of revenue every year due to tigers
 baaghon kii suraksha ke naam par karodon rupee kaa bajet har saal aata he, lekin pichley kuch samay se baaghon kii maut ne ramnagar ko surkhiyon main laa diya he
 Sometimes tigers are losing their lives in mutual conflict, and sometimes in suspicious circumstances, the carcasses of tigers are being recovered
 bhale hi baaghon kii maut kii vajah alag-alag hon, lekin baaghon kaa lagaataar maranaa kai sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 However, Corbett officials consider the deaths of tigers a coincidence
 sehi se bhi hui baagh kii maut-ek baagh kii maut to khud jangal main sehi (pahari bhashaa main shol kaha jaataa he ) ke hamale kii vajah se hui
 Earlier, tigers have been killed in the attack of Sehi in Corbett
 van adhikariyon ke mutabik, jangal main sehi achaanak baghin ke saamne aa gai hogi yaa baghin ne use apana shikaar banane kaa prayaas kiya hoga
 For this reason, he realized the danger and left the arrow hooks on his body in defense
 yahi kaante baghin ke sharir par jagah-jagah ghus gaye jisase ghaav banane ke baad sankraman ho gaya
 Excessive bleeding led to the death of the tigress
 sehi ke kaante chah inch se ek feet tak hote hai
 Data of tigers killed in 6 months - 1 January - Kaladhungi Range - Ramnagar Forest Division

 Nautanki was the actress in this event of the academy, Nanda Devi above sixty came from Bisalpur town of Pilibhit district of typical Terai
 vahaan chal rahi nautanki dekhakar ve apane ko sach kehane se na roak sakin
 Even in this age, she says in her sarcastic voice, "in our days, artists used to sing mostly by holding the mic
 nautanki badal gai he
 Now the game should be dramatic as well
 nai nautanki ko janata pasand kar rahi he
 "the Central Sangeet Natak Akademi has conducted more than a hundred festivals in the last year and more than 30 have taken place in the last two months
 isamen se bhi zyaadaatar na sirf dilli se baahar balki rajdhani shaharon se bhi pare, nae-nae anchalon main ho rahe hai
 In cities where there is not even a grand auditorium and other basic amenities for staging
 haa, vahaan ve deshaj or jeevant log hai jo virtual reality se dur hai or kala tathaa kalpana ke liye urvar jameen muhaiyaa karaate hai
 Famous for Alha, be it a four-day Aalha festival in Mahoba in Bundelkhand or the Lankapodi Jatra associated with Ramlila in Bishipada (kandhamal), Odisha
 isi tarah udaipur (tripura), dharwar (karnataka), junagarh (gujarat) or assam ke kai chote-chote kasbe bhi saanskrithik nakshe par ubharkar aae
 Be it Nautanki or Nach, turra-kalangi or Domkach, or Sattriya dance of Assam
 bisiyon lok or paaramparik vidhaon ke saikadon asal kalakaar in utsavon main shirkat kar rahe hai
 In Darbhanga, 350 artists took the stage in three days and more than 500 came in Azamgarh
 vahaan to das jodi nakkarawadakon se ek saath bajvaya gaya
 In the northeast, the academy has organized two major events in less than a year, taking help of the army in Kakching town adjoining Myanmar, 50 km from the capital Imphal in Manipur
 purvottar main dilchaspee kii ek or vajah vahaan pichley do dashak se aresas kii saanskrithik ikai sanskaar bharti kii vishesh ruchi or sakriyata ho sakati he, jisane lata mangeshkar, ratan thium or kanhai laal jaise bhartiya sangeet, rangamanch ke sheersh naamon ko bahut pehle se apane salaahkaaron main shaamil kar rakhaa he
 Whatever the reason, the change is moving from the academy's boardroom to the lower level
 academy ke adhyaksh pad par sava saal puure karne vaale gayak-abhinayta shekhar sen up-sachivon ko baqayada bharat kaa nakshaa lekar baithaate hai or aise ilaake khojane ko kehete hai, jahaan abhi tak academy kaa koi kaarykram nahin hua
 The General Council meeting was held in Far Agartala last month to choose the Academy Awards which were announced recently
 dilli ke mandi house main rabindra bhawan sthit academy ke daftar main afasaron, karmchaariyon kaa ravaiya badla hua lagata he
 The point is that when talking, working in remote areas was also included in the purpose before, but now it has come to the center
 doosraa, lok kalakaaron ko sammaan bhi adhik mil rahaa he
 An artist gets Rs 3,000-3,500 instead of Rs 2,000 with travel allowances and better hotel facilities for participation in the festivities
 tak mil rahaa he
 His audience was the same as he was in big cities
 ab gramin ilaakon ke log bhi un kalaon, kalakaaron ko dekh-sun rahe hai, jinke bare main abhi tak unhone duusare logon se suna yaa unke bare main akhabaaron main padhaa tha
 The trap of middlemen is also seen in the events
 asal main, academy ab jo kar rahi he, vah pehle se hi uske agenda main ahm hona chahie tha
 Jainendra, a 32-year-old friend of Chhapra in Bihar, who is doing research on popular folk dances like Launda dance from Jawaharlal Nehru University, says, "it was outstanding in the Sangeet Natak Academy
" enesdy ne european style drama ko badhaava diya
 The Academy was definitely trying to save the folk arts but till now its movements were concentrated around the cities
 ab vah gaanvon kii taraf chali he
 "friends" are also going to propose to the academy for the dance festival in Chhapra
 ek suzav yah bhi he ki ab academy har anchal main lok kalakaaron ke kuch group banaakar unke prashikshan kaa intjaam karke unke rangamandal bana de
 Regular performances of these trained artists and seeing them get respectable livelihood will inspire other artists from the rural areas
 is tarah yah ek silsilaa ban sakegaa
 But friends caution one aspect here
 ''kai jagahon par lok kalakaar to gramin hai lekin unke kartadharta dilli main hi baithe rahete hai
 In order to help the artists in the true sense, the Academy will have to avoid such arrogance
 xxrep 4 ' sangeet naatak academy ko billi ke bacchon kii tarah lekar gum rahaa hum''sangeet naatak academy kaa chairman bane gayak-abhinayta, 55 varshiya shekhar sen ko sava saal hua he par itane samay main hi unhone academy kii praathamiktaayen badalakar rakh di hai
 The dignity with light smile and reflexes is evident in every step
 daftar ke baahar unhone saaf likhva diya haih kripaya pushpaguchh or uphaar ityadi lekar na aaen
 He gave simple and unambiguous answers to the questions of Assistant Editor-in-law: Medical help to the greatest Concern folk artists on the priorities of the Academy
 ve hamaari dharohar hai
 After 80–90 years, the family also stops asking
 madad milane par parivaar or samaaj main bhi unki garima behaal hogi
 Secondly, the activities of the academy became Delhi-centric
 hamane 40 din main 24 festival kiye
 The deputy secretaries (of the academy) have been gifted a map of India and asked them to work in areas where the academy has not yet reached
 main esene ko billi ke bacchon kii tarah lekar gum rahaa hum
 Administrator by being an artist: If an artist is not a good administrator then he cannot be a good artist
 viraasat main mili paanch sansthaaen pehle bhi chalaata rahaa hum
 On being strict towards the critics of the famous BJP BJP, politics is not my subject, not even interest
 vaise congress, sipiem or aap main bhi mere mitra hai
 The problem arises out of communication
 main lagaataar ghumta hum or kalakaaron se samvaad kaayam rakhaa he
 The characters i staged were all rebellious
 kabir likhaa jab desh main dange ho rahe the
 On the question of leaving the position, if the government changed, he is a fakad man
 roj suutakes pack karke rakhte hai

 There are more than one thief and super thief in this world
 lekin super choron kii isi fehrist main ab jo nayaa naam he, uski karatuut ke aage maanon duniya ke baaki chor pani bharte hai
 Because this thief only steals luxury cars and that too directly from five hotels
 ab sawaal ye he ki anginat sisitivi camere or security gards ke bich se aakhir wo gaadiyaan chura kaise letaa he? to bas, isi sawaal ke jawaab main is super chor kii puri kahani chhipi he
 What you cannot think, this thief can do
 jo aap dekh nahin sakate ye chor wo dekh letaa he or jo duusare chor nahin kar sakate, ye chor wo kar saktaa he
 Perhaps then, these thieves are among the super thieves of the country, who put their hands on them and even the uniforms consider themselves lucky
 26 agast, 2016 ko dilli ke hotel holly-de in, kisi bhi duusare din kii tarah is vakt hotel main mehmaanon kii awajahi kaa silsilaa jari tha
 Then a white gleaming odi q intake car is seen coming from the main gate of the hotel
 keemat he 80 lakh rupee
 This car belongs to the Garg family of Delhi, who has arrived here for dinner
 car ke maalik anil garg car kii chaabi vaile parking atendent ke hawaale karte hai or puure parivaar ke saath itmeenaan se dinar ke liye andar chale jate hai, lekin kuch hi der baad jab wo apni gaadi se koi saamaan nikaalane ke liye dobaaraa hotel kii lobby main pahunchate hai, unhen naa to apni car milti he, naakaar kii chaabior naa hi vaile kaa token
 Hotel management is also surprised that this is a sign of the car being stolen
 lekin five star hotel jaisi ek hai profile jagah par
 Where CCTV cameras are installed on the scene, security personnel are guarded round the clock
 har taraf marshalls kii chaukas nigahen hai, vahaan bhala koi chor itani mahangi car wo bhi vaile parking se udaakar kaise le ja saktaa he to iskaa sach jaanane ke liye hotel ke surakshakarmi fouran hotel kii entry se lekar vaile parking aria or yahaan tak ki lobby kii sisitivi footage khangaalana shuru kar dete hai
 But what they see in this effort, the hotel management's eyes are torn by seeing what they see
 parking desk se uda lee gaadi kii chabiody car ke get se enter hone ke thik kuch hi minute baad genes, tii shart or sports shoej main ek noujvaan puri confidence ke saath hotel ke andar daakhil hota he
 After this, this person is seen constantly talking on mobile phones in different parts of the hotel
 kabhi lobby main, kabhi get ke paas, to kabhi kahin or
 But shortly after, this person does such a game that the watchers just keep watching
 wo vaile parking ke paas bhi ye impressant dete hue lagaataar mobile phone par baat karata rahata he, jaise wo is hotel kaa koi guest ho or mauka milte hi parking desk ke ek car kii chaabi uda letaa he
 And by coincidence, this is the key to the same Audi Q7 car, and then something happens that nobody can think of
 wo farrotedaar angreji bolta he
 Has completed MBA
 achche ghar se taalluk bhi rakhata he lekin phir bhi chori karata he
 In other words, the more you hear about this super thief, the more you are surprised
 or is vakt ham is chor kii jis karatuut kaa zikr kar rahe hai, usamen to iskaa confidence dekhte hi banataa he
 
 
 
 aise le gaya gaadi chori karajaise hi mauka miltaa he wo vaile parking vaali jagah par baat karte-karte ek car kii chaabi uda letaa he
 These pictures are of course not very clear that by watching these pictures of CCTV, his actions can definitely be understood
 or phir agle hi minute wo puure style ke saath us audi kyuu seven car ke paas pahunchataa he, jo thik get ke paas lage security gards ke cabin ke bagal main park kii gai he
 He immediately opens the car, sits in it and after taking a few steps back, gets out from the other side very easily
 sach to ye he ki in tasveeron ko dekh kar kisi ko ye gumaan nahin ho saktaa he ki ye koi chor he or yun ek car chura kar le ja rahaa he
 But when shortly after, the owner of the car reaches here looking for his car and gets a loud shock
 satyendra ke khilaaf do darjan se zyada maamlebaat police tak pahunchati he or ek aaleeshaan hotel se shandaar car ke chori ho jane kii khabar se pulisavaale bhi hairaan rah jate hai
 The investigation proceeds through CCTV footage and the thief is identified

 Its name is Satyendra Singh Shekhawat and it is 35 years old
 satyendra ke khilaaf dilli-ensiaar or rajasthan samet kai suubon ke alag-alag thanon main do darjan se zyada maamle darj hai
 While eight to ten of these cases are of thefts of luxury cars
 police ne bichaaya jafab police lagaataar satyendra kaa peechha karti he or is koshish main jald hi use jaipur se dilli ke raste main ek audi kyuu seven car najar aati he
 Incidentally, intelligence has already been received this time of Satyendra coming to Delhi and preparing to kill a car at another Five Star Hotel Hyatt Regency
 ab police usee audi kyuu seven car par nigaah banaae rakhti he
 Incidentally, the number of this car captured in the CCTV camera of a toll plaza is from Maharashtra, but the person driving it is Satyendra Jain
 ab police jaal bichaati he or aakhirkaar use usee audi kyuu seven car ke saath dilli se hi daboch liya jaataa he, jo usne pichley agast maheene main hotel holiday in se churaai thi
 Yes, he did change the number of this car
 aa gaya police ke haathon mempulice kii maane to satyendra emb kar chukaa he or farrate se angreji bolta he
 Belongs to a good home and has also worked in a travel agency
 police ke mutabik yaheen se use hotel ke taur-tareekon kaa pataa chalaa tha or lakjri kaaron se lagaav bhi paidaa hua
 But instead of working hard to achieve these things, he chose the path of crime and started stealing luxury cars one after the other
 khaas baat ye he ki ye lakjri kaaren udaane ke baad wo use aage nahin bechata balki apane khaas logon ke hawaale kar unase kamai bhi karata he or inhi kaaron se nashili chizon kii taskari bhi karata he
 Because usually the police do not hand over expensive vehicles
 lekin ab wo ek baar phir se police ke shikanje main he

 vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle himachal congress main ghamaasan shuru ho gaya he
 According to sources, Congress State President Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu has been continuously preferred for a long time, Chief Minister of the state Virbhadra Singh did not like it
 wo lagaataar sukkhu ko hataane maang alaakaman se kar rahe hai
 Alam was that Virbhadra Singh was not ready to meet Himachal general secretary Ambika Soni along with Sukhu till sometime back
 ab unhone congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko khat likhakar saaf kaha he ki ab main naa to chunaav laduunga or naa hi ladaauungaa
 When Ambika was not ready to meet Soni with Sukkhuvirbhadra, Ambika enlisted Ahmed Patel's help on Sonia Gandhi's instructions
 sonia ke raajnneetik sachiv ahamed patel kii maujuudagi main ambika ke ghar par sukkhu or virbhadra ek saath aaye
 In this meeting, Ahmed assured Virbhadra that the responsibility for the next election rests with AAP
 aap hi hamaara cheharaa ho
 Just let Sukhu remain the president, he will do according to you
 mushkil se virbhadra maan gaye the, lekin ambika ko lekar unki naaraazgi bani rahi
 When due to health reasons, Ambika asked to take charge of the same state as general secretary in charge, then another senior leader Sushil Kumar Shinde was made the general secretary in charge of Himachal
 haalanki alaakaman ke nirdesh par jab scindia ne bhi virbhadra virdohi sukkhu or jies bali se alag se baat kii, to virbhadra singh phir naakhush ho gaye
 They felt that they were behaving contrary to what was promised to them
 saath hi virbhadra kaa maananaa he ki sukkhu lagaataar ahamed ke aashwaasan ke baavjood virbhadra virdohi raajnneeti karte rahe
 According to the sources, in a hurry, Virbhadra wrote angry letters to Ahmed Patel along with Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi last week
 isamen alaakaman par dabaav daalate huevirbhadrane do took likhaa ki main pehle bhi rajya main party sanghathan ke halaat kii jaankaree aap logon ko detaa rahaa hum, lekin paristhitiyaan jas kii tas hai
 In such a situation, i will neither contest elections nor contest the party
 virbhadra ne is khat kii copy prabharee mahasachiv scindia ko bhi bhej di he
 Since then, everyone has swollen hands and feet in the party
 sutron ke mutabik sonia gandhi ko bhi samaj aa gaya he ki ab baat prabharee ke haath se upar kii he
 That is why once Ahmed Patel has been entrusted with the responsibility of convincing Virbhadra Singh, but just before the election, Virbhadra's attitude is nothing short of bad news for the high command
 sutron ke mutabik virbhadra singh jald hi dilli aakar alaakaman se do took faisla karnaa chaahate hai
 In fact, Sukhu is considered close to Rahul Gandhi
 isiilie ambika hon yaa scindia wo sukkhu ko tarjeeh dene ko majaboor rahe
 Currently Rahul is abroad and Ahmed is in Gujarat
 aise main yah maamla or pechida ho gaya he, lekin congress alaakaman bhi yah jaanata he ki virbhadra kaa kad himachal main vaisaa hi he, jaisaa punjab main amarinder kaa
 Therefore, for the Congress to resolve the Himachal Congress dispute is no less than a challenge

 Home Minister Amit Shah has launched a scathing attack on the Congress in the Lok Sabha, he has said who made the mistake of partitioning the country
 jammu-kashmir ke mudde par jari charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue kaha hamane aatank ke khilaaf ghar main ghuskar safaya kiya he
 He said that while questioning the Kashmir policy of the country's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, he said that who had announced a ceasefire when our army was chasing the Kabilis who came from Pakistan
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki tatkaaleen pradhanmantri ne desh ke grahamantri sardaar patel ko bhi bharose main nahin liya tha
 He said that there was a similar problem in Junagadh and Hyderabad, but it was solved by Patel
 lekin kashmir kii jimmedaari pandit nehru ke haathon thi
 There was a lot of uproar in the House over his statement
 amit shah ne kaha vah maanate hai ki jammu-kashmir kii awam ke bich khai he
 Earlier Amit Shah said that earlier in Jammu and Kashmir, security was given to those making statements against India
 hamaari sarkaar ne aise 919 logon kii suraksha waapas le lee gai he
 Amit Shah said that BJP has not created the problem of Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir main loktantr kaa majaak udaaya gaya
 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had a suspicious death
 amit shah ne jammu-kashmir main chunaav atal bihari vaajapeyi ji ne karaayaa tha, chunaav hamaare shashan main hue the
 Amit Shah lashed out at Congress leaders and said that if you talk about history, you will have to listen to the scolding
 unhone kaha ki jammu-kashmir main congress ne shankaa ke beej boe jo aaj ped ban chukaa he
 Amit Shah said that those who oppose India should have fear in their minds, we are not members of a gang
 - jammu kashmir kii awam or bharat kii awam ke bich ek khai paidaa kii gai kyonki pehle se hi bharosa banane kii koshish hi nahin kii gai
 - On 23 June 1953, when Shyama Prasad Mukherjee went to Jammu and Kashmir to protest against the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, the practice of permits and the two Prime Ministers in the country, he was arrested and died there
 - shyama prasad mukherjee ji kii mrityu kii jaanch honi chahie yaa nahin, kyonki mukherjee ji vipaksh ke netaa the, desh ke or bengal ke netaa the
 Today, if Bengal is a part of the country, then Mukherjee ji has a huge contribution in it
 - jammu-kashmir main chunaav ayog jab bhi tay karegaa tab loktrantik tareeke se chunaav karaae jaaenge
 There will be no interference from the central government in that
 - jammu-kashmir kii awam ke man dar nahin hona chahie
 Those who want to break the country should have fear
 - jammu kashmir kii awam ko ham apana maanate hai, unhen apane gale lagaana chaahate hai
 But the doubt that has already been put in it is causing problems in it
 - aaj tak panchayaton ko panch or sarpanch chunane kaa adhikaar hi nahin diya gaya tha
 Only 3 families ruled in Kashmir for so many years
 gram panchayat, tehsil panchayat, nagar panchayat sab kaa shashan vahi karen or sarkaar bhi vahi chalaaen
 Why this, is Jammu and Kashmir not a part of India? - kashmir main hue panchayat chunaav ho yaa abhi hue loksabhaa chunaav ek khun kaa kataraa bhi kashmir main jameen par nahin gira or aap kah rahe hai ki control nahin he
 Control is different from the point of view
 - ghati ke andar 6 hajaar transit awaason kaa nirmaan kashmiri panditon ke liye hamane shuru kiya he
 - 370, but you have forgotten the word temporary, it is temporary, not permanent
 370 hamaare samvidhan kaa asthaayee mudda he ye yaad rakhiyegaa
 Let us tell you that Home Minister Amit Shah introduced the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Amendment Bill 2019 in the Lok Sabha on Friday and proposed to extend President's rule in the state for 6 months
 loksabhaa main prastaav pesh karte hue amit shah ne kaha ki is saal ke ant tak rajya main chunaav sambhav he
 The Home Minister said that it was the holy month of Ramadan, now the Amarnath Yatra is to be held, due to which it was not possible to hold elections
 is saal ke ant main chunaav karaane kaa faisla liya gaya
 Amit Shah also proposed to give reservation to people living on the international border in the Lok Sabha
 congress ne raashtrapati shashan kii avadhi badhaane kaa virodh kiya he
 Watching a horror movie can prove fatal
 tamilnadu ke tiruvanmalai main aisa hi maamla saamne aayaa he

 There is a big disclosure related to the world of politics before the general election
 pataa chalaa he ki hamaare desh main saikadon aise raajnneetik dal hai jinhen motaa chanda miltaa he jabaki ve chunaav bhi nahin ladate
 This has been revealed by the reply received through an RTI
 ek angreji akhbaar ne chunaav ayog se soochna lene ke baad yah khabar di he
 According to the news, there are many such parties in the country that do not contest elections, but they have received donations ranging from one lakh to five crores
 ye partiyaan dilli-ensiaar se lekar mumbai tak faili hui hai
 The newspaper has reported that Phoenix Rising, an event management company in Itanagar, has donated Rs 15 lakh to a party in Delhi
 is party kaa naam he neshnal youth party
 Similarly there is another party Forum for Presidential Democracy and it is based in Mumbai
 ise vahiin ke neptune resorts and developers ne 1
 Has donated Rs 5 lakh
 chunaav ayog ke paas is vakt desh bhar ke 1600 raajnneetik dalon kaa baqayda registration he or inamen se zyaadaatar chunaav nahin ladatin
 But most of them get donations
 ye chanda detii hai choti companiyaan
 The amount of donation is from 11,000 rupees to 5 crores
 kyon mil rahaa he chanda?is sawaal kaa jawaab thodaa mushkil he
 When the newspaper asked the Secretary of the Forum for Presidential Democracy, he said that he wanted to contest the elections and therefore was taking donations
 chunaav ayog ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki inke chanda lene kaa kaaran yah he ki isse unhen inakam tex main chhot milti he
 Most small parties have told that they want to change the existing system, so they have formed a party and are taking donations
 hairaani kii baat he ki in partiyon ko chanda doordaraj ke shaharon se bhi mil rahaa he
 Jhaveri & Company Exports, an Ahmedabad-based company, donated Rs 2 crore to Rashtriya Vikas Party, a party from Faridabad
 is party ko kai jagahon se chanda mila he
 One such peculiar case is that of the All India United Democratic Front of Guwahati's party
 ise bengaluru or mumbai kii do companiyon ne chanda diya he

 karnataka ke mukhyamantri bi

 yediurppa ne somvaar subah upachunaav ke rup main congress or janata dal secular (JDS) ke mukaable ek badi ladaai jitkar dikhaai he, jisamen bahut kuch daanv par laga tha
 Broadly, due to the leaders from these two opposition parties, BJP was seen winning 12 of the total 15 assembly seats till 12 noon on Monday

 The by-elections came because the congress-jds government fell in July after 17 mlas rebelled
 supreme court ne unhen ayogy qaraar diya, lekin dobaaraa chunaav ladane kii anumati de di, or phir pichley maah ve aupchaarik rup se bhartiya janata party (BJP) main shaamil ho gaye
 B

 Yeddyurappa could possibly be counted among the most religious leaders in the country, and for the last two days he was visiting all the major temples in the area
 iske alaava unhone bengaluru sthit mukhyamantri awaas main bhi nirbaadh riley puja yojit kii thi
 What did the results of the byelection that came at the end of the year, filled with extreme volatility, teach us about political temperature
 
 
 ? pehali sikh yah he ki yadi BJP ke viruddh vipaksh behatar pradarshan karnaa chahta he, to use har rajya main sharad pavaar sareekha ek cheharaa chahie

 Yeddyurappa was well aware that he had a simple majority with 105 seats, so he left no stone unturned and continued campaigning for the by-elections

 lekin ab kumaraswami ko apni party kaa aakaar ghat jane kii chintaa kerani hogi, kyonki ab unke netaaon ke liye congress or BJP kahin zyaada aakarshak vikalp hai
 Third, (prime Minister) Narendra Modi and (BJP President) Amit Shah, who are running the most centralized form of the party in the history of BJP and want to run the states through negligible leadership, have not done so yet

 yediurppa sakriy raajnneeti se alag hat jane ke liye modi or shah kii lagu kii hui 75 varsh kii ayusima ko laangh chuke hai, or mukhyamantri banane kii unki khwaahish ko bhi kendriya netritv se zyaada madad nahin mili he
 But he remains a force for himself, and he has no regrets about his desire to remain in active politics
 unhone yah bhi spasht kar diya he ki karnataka main unke bina BJP dhah jaaegi
 In the year 2012, during a period of anger b

 Yeddyurappa had also left the BJP to form his own party, but in January 2014, he returned to the parent party, and the Modi wave was strongly influenced in the subsequent Lok Sabha elections
 dilli main baithi sarkaar dwaara ek-str se raajnneeti kiye jane kii bharsak koshishon ke baavjood rajyon main majbooti bani hui he
 It will not be easy for Modi and Shah to sidestep the party's regional satraps - like Vasundhara Raje Scindia in Rajasthan and Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Madhya Pradesh
 donon hi dilli aane se inkaar kar chuke hai, or party upaadhyaksh bana die jane ke baavjood unhone apane-apane rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ke rup main vaapasi karne kii mahatvakanksha ko tilanjali dene se bhi inkaar kar diya he

 The Congress hoped that it would win a Maharashtra-like victory, where it has managed to be a part of the government without a fight
 bahut ajeeb baat he ki congress ko yah ehsaas hota bhi nahin dikh rahaa he ki vah maharashtra main chauthe number kii party ban gai he, jabaki haal hi tak vah vahaan prabhaavshaalee party rahi he, kam se kam vipaksh main to prabhavi thi hi
 In Maharashtra, the recent incumbent Uddhav has been threatening the Thackeray-led Shiv sena-congress-ncp alliance to act like BJP leader Yeddyurappa
 yah dhyaan main rakhane laayak baat he ki gathbandhan main abhi tak mantralayon ko lekar sahmati nahin ban pai he, isliye thakare ko BJP kii ore se saavdhaan rahane kii bahut zarurat he
 Ultimately, if the JDS becomes even weaker after these results, the BJP will benefit more than the Congress
 congress ke ek varisht netaa ne naam nahin chhapane kii shart par kaha, "ek baar jab yediurppa kaa yug khatm ho jayega, or yadi vah apane rahete kisi or BJP netaa ko mukhyamantri na banane den, to BJP ke liye vikalpaheenata kii sthiti ban jaaegi, or tab congress ko laabh mil saktaa he

 Vaibhav Raut was a familiar face in Nalasopara under the Mumbai metropolitan area
 yaa kam se kam uske padosi use ek aise gorakshak ke rup main jaanate the jo kasaai kii dukaanon par gaiyrkanoonee dhang se chaape martha tha or bif kii taskari kaa aarope lagaakar hamale karata tha
 Even the police knew him and sometimes asked him to stay away from the area during the festival of Bakrid
 lekin uske padosiyon ko is baat kaa tanik bhi andaja nahin tha ki raut bam bhi banaata tha
 The anti-terrorist Squad (ATS) of Maharashtra arrested Raut, Sudhanwa Gondhalekar and Sharad Kalaskar on August 11 in Nalasopara

 congress-ensipi kii rajya sarkaar ne 13 janvari, 2011 ko centre kii upie sarkaar se is sanghathan par pratibandh lagane ke liye kaha tha
 But the Home Ministry rejected the proposal, saying there was no evidence against the organization
 bhaajapa-shivasena kii maujuuda sarkaar ne is sanghathan par pratibandh lagane ke prastaav par dobaaraa vichaar kiya or 13 november, 2015 ko uske khilaaf kuch nae maamalon ke saath use centre ko bhej diya
 Though Sanatan Sanstha separated Raut from himself without any delay, HJS supported him saying that the ATS continues to harass Hindu activists by creating false cases of terror
 echgees ne apane bayaan main chunauti dete hue kaha, ''unhen adaalat main sabit karne den
 He said that Sadhvi Pragya and Colonel Prasad Purohit had to spend many years in jail in the 2008 Malegaon case, but they were released on bail with no firm evidence in court

 His colleagues say that he was not someone who could make bombs
 unamem se ek kaa kahana he, ''ve to apshabdon kaa istemaal tak nahin karte the
 He had deep faith in Sanatan Dharma
 ham is baat par kaise vishwaas kar len ki khaali samay main ve bam banaate the
 "gondhalekar was a subscriber of Sanatan Prabhat, the fortnightly magazine of Sanatan Sanstha
 uske do bachche hai or use antarmukhi kism ke vyakti ke taur par janaa jaataa tha
 He used to do computer animation business in Pune and is suspected to have technical knowledge of bomb making
 police ko us par bhi shaq tha ki uske sambandh sambhaji bhide kii sanstha shiv pratishthan hindustan se the
 This is the same Sambhaji who was suspected to be involved in inciting ethnic violence in koregaon-bhima in January this year
 kalaskar zyada padhaa-likhaa nahin he
 It is said that he used to visit his parents at short intervals and he received Rs 10,000-15,000
 diya karata tha
 Her family says they did not know the source of her income
 in teenon sandigdhon ke vakil sanjeev punalekar kaa kahana he ki unke muvakkil bekasoor hai or unhen keval isliye ''fansaaya ja rahaa he ki ve gohatya kaa virodh karte the
 "their devotion to the cow is being said to be a basis due to which they could not keep such a large number of bombs and deadly weapons
" yahaan tak ki nalasopara main bhi bahuton kaa yahi maananaa he ki uski giraftaar aties kii sajeesh kaa hissaa he
 The motive behind raising arms, and who was their target, has not been answered yet

 ) Ruckus continues in the Punjab Congress over Navjot Singh Sidhu
 isi bich sutron ke hawaale se ye khabar saamne ai ki rahul gandhi ke offis or congress alaakaman ne navjot singh siddhu or unki patni navjot cor siddhu ke punjab congress ke netaaon or captain amarinder singh ke khilaaf die gaye bayanon kii video clip or puri report maangi he
 Although the leaders of Punjab Congress are not saying anything openly on this issue, but they made it clear that the report of statements made by Punjab Congress President Sunil Jakhar on behalf of Navjot Singh Sidhu and his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu from Delhi High Command Has been sought
 punjab congress ke kaaryakari adhyaksh or management cameti ke chairman laal singh ne is baat kii pushti kii, lekin unhone kaha ki is puure maamle par report congress adhyaksh sunil jakhad kii taraf se di jaaegi or wo philhal dilli main hi maujuud hai
 Now Congress mlas are also openly opposing Navjot Singh Sidhu against this whole issue
 purv mantri or congress vidhayak rana gurjeet ne kaha ki navjot singh siddhu ke bayaan se congress ko baari nuksaan hua he
 Just 1 day before the election, the way Navjot Singh Sidhu has given the statement, he has lost the hard work of all the leaders who have been working hard in the field for the last several days to win the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections
 agar navjot singh siddhu ko koi samasya thi bhi to unhen band kamare main captain amarinder singh ke saath baithkar baatcheet kerani chahie thi na ki yun publikali media or saarvajanik manch se statement dekar party kaa nuksaan karnaa chahie tha
 At the same time, the Akali Dal, while quipping on the ongoing dispute between Captain Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu, said that the way Rahul Gandhi has kept silence on this whole issue, it seems that somewhere Rahul Gandhi and the party high command On the instigation of Navjot Singh Sidhu is making such statements so that Captain Amarinder Singh can be removed from his post
 agar congress party navjot singh siddhu ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin karti he to aise main saaf he ki congress alaakaman kii shah par hi navjot singh siddhu or unki patni captain ko target karne main lage hai

 Even from Ajmer to Attock, Sufi tradition breaks the limits of religion in this part of the world
 phir bhi pichley ek dashak main pakistan main sufi dharmasthalon par kareeb 3 darjan hamalon main saikadon log jaan ganvaa chuke hai
 Even though people of every religion get heart-rending at the tomb of Sufis in India, today there are solid reasons why this sect is fighting for survival in Pakistan
 jehad ko samarthanpakistan ke janak mohammad ali jinna ne ek secular pakistan kaa sapana dekha tha
 But by the eighties, the road to Pakistan had turned the other way
 assi ke dashak kii shuruyaat main america ne afghanistan main soviet sena ko maat dene ke liye afghanistan main jehad kaa project shuru kiya to us vakt ke pakistani taanashaah jiya ul haq khushi-khushi 'ankal sam' ke saath ja mili
 As a result, the idea of jihad took deep roots in Pakistan
 aaj pakistan main lashkar-e-jhangavi, jaish-e-mohammad, sipah-e-sahaba jaise kai sanghathan fal-phool rahe hai, jo sufi hi nahin balki islam ke duusare alpsankhyakon jaise shiya or ahmadiya ke vajood ke bhi khilaaf hai
 Politics and terror are called Pakistan, after Allah, America and Army are run by Allah only
 yahaan kii sena kii dahshagard tanjeemon ke saath khaas dosti rahi he
 Pakistani political forces not only tolerate extremist organizations but also instigate them to keep the chair from the powerful army
 aise hi tabakon ko khush karne ke liye siyaasi partiyon ne alpsankhyakon ke saath bhedbhaav vaale aise kai kanoon banaae jinke liye pragatisheel duniya main shaayad hi kahin jagah ho
 This is the reason why Pakistanis are not able to think of a way to stop radical Sunni terrorist organizations
 khadi deshon se linkakharaab arthvyavastha ke chalate badi taadaad main middle class pakistani khadi deshon kaa rukh karte hai
 This trend, which began in the eighties, is today at the stage that the earnings from the workers of Gulf countries form a significant part of the total GDP of Pakistan
 lekin inamen se kai kaamgaar jab lautate hai to khadi deshon main prachlit kattar wahabi islam kaa asar bhi saath laate hai
 Today the situation is such that many terrorists in Arab countries have been caught in Pakistan
 pahchaan kaa sankatpakistan kii neenv majahab kii buniyaad par rakhi gai thi
 After the split in 1971, the basis of this identity was lost
 isaki pratikriya main pakistan ne bhartiya jadon ko bhuulakar khud ko arab samskruti main rangane kii koshish kii
 As a result, the space for domestic practices like Sufi was reduced
 pakistan main schuli shiksha bhi kuch aisi he jo kattarwad ko badhaava detii he
 Hence a large section of the Pakistani population strongly supports the radical Sunni leaders

 darasal, yachika mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke 23 agast ko kiye gaye twit ko centre main rakhkar kiya gaya tha
 In which immersion was allowed till 6 pm on Dashami, because the next day is Muharram
 lihaaza, visarjan par roak laga di gai thi or visarjan 2 taarikh se kiye jane ke aadesh die gaye the
 The petition was filed by the Youth Bar Association of India
 jisamen kaha gaya ki mukhyamantri ke twitor acount ke lakhon folover hai or ye samudaay vishesh ke tushtikaran ke liye bade samudaay ke dharmik rasm rivaaj ke saath thik nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 With this, feelings of hurt and harmony are also expected to deteriorate
 saath hi samvidhan kii dhara 14, 25 or 26 kaa ulanghan bhi he
 Last year too, the case went to court on a similar order by Mamta Banerjee
 court ne rajya sarkaar ko fatkaar lagate hue kaha tha ki ye tushtikaran kii niti he or raajnneeti ko dharm se na jode
 The court had also said last year that in 1982 and 1983, Dashami and Muharram were lying back and forth one day, then no restriction was imposed

 This is a tremendous slap on the policy of appeasement
 kailash vijayawargeey kaa kahana he ki mamata yah sirf vot kii raajnneeti ke liye kar rahi thi
 Light was playing a game of politics, which has exposed his face
 sarkaar ko kahana chahie ki hindu bhai apana tyohaar manaaen or muslim bhai apana tyohaar manaaen
